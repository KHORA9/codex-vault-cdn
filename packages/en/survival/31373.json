EDSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublished by the Author\r\nat\r\n1728 New Jersey Ave., N. W., Washington, D. C.\r\nIn the Year 1900.\r\n\r\nPress Work by Byron S. Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN MILAN C. EDSON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1900\r\nby Milan C. Edson.\r\nAll Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book, is dedicated to the sons and daughters of the farms of the\r\nRepublic as an expression of the author's realization, that Agricultural\r\npeople constitute a large majority of its working units: That as such,\r\nits destiny is in the hands of their boys and girls, as its future\r\nguardians, fathers and mothers: That for the reasons stated, they should\r\nbecome its dominant thinkers and leaders: That Agriculture is the true\r\nbasis of industrial and commercial success; hence, it should be made the\r\nmost noble and pleasing of all occupations: That the alarming\r\nencroachments of land monopoly, and the inability of the small farm to\r\nmeet the expense of using the latest and best machinery, threatens the\r\ntotal extinction of all land-owning farmers, and of their consequent\r\nreduction to the dependent caste of farm laborers: That the isolated\r\nlife and the severe toil of the small farm, has a dangerously depressing\r\neffect on the minds of its people: That all of these things, seem to\r\ndemand the changes suggested by the contents of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrong in my convictions that all civilizations are false, which do not\r\ncivilize the lowest units of any social order, I have written Solaris\r\nFarm as my contribution towards the improvement of agriculturists as a\r\nclass, of the race as a whole; towards the establishment of a truer\r\ncivilization, organized for the purpose of securing the same degree of\r\nprogress for the lowest orders of humanity, which have been or can be\r\nattained by the highest. In any social or political fabric, wide\r\ndifferences of wealth, of education, of refinement in its sub-divisions\r\nare dangerous, they swiftly lead to the introduction of caste. Caste is\r\nthe dry rot, which, when once established, will surely destroy all\r\nprogress, all vitality, by slowly eating away the social, industrial and\r\npolitical life of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this book for the press, I wish to acknowledge my\r\nobligations to the following authors, for much valuable information and\r\ninspiration: To Elmer Gates, the discoverer of new domains in\r\nPsychology, the inventor and discoverer of the art of Mentation, the\r\nfounder of the Elmer Gates Laboratory, at Chevy Chase, Maryland: To\r\nHenry George, the author of \"Progress and Poverty:\" To Edward Bellamy,\r\nthe author of \"Equality,\" and \"Looking Backward:\" And lastly to that\r\ngreatest of living Frenchmen, M. Godin, the author of \"Social\r\nSolutions,\" and the founder of the \"Familistere,\" with its famous\r\nindustrial enterprise, located at the city of Guise, France; the\r\ngrandest co-operative success of the age!\r\n\r\nA last word to my readers: Do you wish to join forces with the\r\nhumanitarians? If so, always strive so to educate the people, that they\r\nmay fully understand the true object and purpose of human life; and the\r\nnecessity for the upbuilding of social, industrial and political\r\ninstitutions, in harmony with the demands of that purpose. This will\r\nrequire unselfish, persistent, co-operative effort and thought. In no\r\nother way, can you so greatly aid the cause of progress.\r\n\r\nMILAN C. EDSON.\r\n\r\nNo. 1728 N. J. Ave., N.

The superb view before them was well\r\nworthy of their half-hour's silent admiration. Full one thousand feet\r\nabove the sea stands \"Hotel Mount Meenahga\" in the heart of the\r\n\"Shawangunks,\" a mountain range in the state of New York, famed for its\r\nscenic beauty, cool dry air, pure water and commanding elevation.\r\nLooking northward a most charming landscape presents itself, a wonderful\r\ngroup of mountain ranges, stretching for seventy-five miles from near\r\nthe Delaware Water-gap eastward to and including the Alpine peaks of the\r\nfamous Catskills. Within this lovely semicircle lie the highlands of\r\nUlster, Sullivan and Orange, lifted like seats in some vast\r\namphitheater, tier above tier, while nearer a beautiful mingling of\r\nvillages and hamlets, broad fields, green woods and silvery\r\nwater-courses, constitutes a picture of enchanting beauty--a picture\r\nconstantly changed, shaded and intensified by broad patches of moving\r\nshadow and sunlight from a great fleet of fleecy clouds sailing so\r\nswiftly, so silently and so majestically across the summer sky.\r\n\r\n\"How exquisitely beautiful!\" murmured Fillmore Flagg, \"I wish I had my\r\ncamera that I might make it captive, carry it hence and keep it, a rare\r\ntoken of beauty, a source of joy forever.\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, a brief description of the young men will serve by way of\r\na further introduction.\r\n\r\nFillmore Flagg was fully six feet in height, though his compact,\r\nwell-rounded figure made him seem less tall; his straight, muscular\r\nlimbs were in harmony with his deep chest and symmetrical shoulders. His\r\nrather large but beautifully turned neck and throat rose straight from\r\nthe spinal column, firmly supporting a noble head, everywhere evenly and\r\nsmoothly developed. His thick, soft brown hair, worn rather short, was\r\ninclined to curl, giving to the outlines of the head a still more heroic\r\nsize. His forehead was large, full, dome shaped and remarkably smooth;\r\nthe brows, finely penciled and well arched, were matched in color and\r\nslenderness by a short moustache which seemed a shade or two darker than\r\nthe hair. His eyes were large, very expressive, of a soft dark brown,\r\nbright and flashing with emotion, full of pensive light when partially\r\nshaded by their thick silken lashes; his smiling glance possessed a\r\ncuriously fascinating magnetic charm. The attractiveness of the entire\r\nface and neck was intensified by the wonderful marble-like smoothness of\r\nskin which accompanies that rare, pale olive tint of complexion. A soft\r\nAlpine hat and a neat business suit of dark clothing completes this\r\npicture of the personal appearance of Fillmore Flagg. Later on we shall\r\nlearn to know him better by his genial temperament, mental and moral\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nGeorge Gaylord was above medium height, slender and pale, slightly\r\ninclined to stoop; wore glasses, and a thick black moustache which\r\nentirely concealed his thin lips. His heavy growth of long, coal black\r\nhair was naturally bent on falling over his high white forehead. His\r\nlarge black eyes were deeply set under heavy dark brows, more square\r\nthan arched. His straight nose and smoothly shaven chin were set in line\r\nwith his high square forehead. While both face and figure suggested the\r\nstudent, a tall silk hat and a square cut, closely buttoned black frock\r\ncoat, stamped him at once as a clerical student.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, George,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"how have you fared since we\r\nparted, and what are your ambitions and plans for the future?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is not much to tell you, Fillmore. As you know, when I left\r\ncollege, my mother was a widow with a very limited income, which made it\r\ndifficult to meet my college expenses. Mother had set her heart on my\r\nentering the ministry. Her only brother, a childless widower, and a man\r\nof some wealth and great influence in the church affairs of his\r\nprosperous New England town, promised his assistance. Behold the result!\r\nI have just graduated with fair honors from a prominent theological\r\ninstitute. I am to take charge, this coming November, of a large church\r\nand congregation in the manufacturing city where my uncle resides. Uncle\r\nGeorge, for whom I was named, is now with my mother visiting friends in\r\nNew York. They have kindly selected as my future wife, my uncle's\r\nfavorite niece and prospective heiress to his wealth. When last we met,\r\nfour years ago, Martha Merritt was a sweet little miss in short\r\ndresses; but gave promise, even then, of unfolding into a lovely woman.\r\nTo tell you the truth, under the circumstances, I am more than half\r\nprepared to fall in love with her when we meet again. However ambitious\r\nmy day dreams in the past may have been, a not unkindly fate has woven\r\nthe web of destiny for me and fixed my future life work without much\r\neffort on my part; and yet I am quite content to have it so. Two weeks\r\nago I left the heat and bustle of the great city for a month's rest in\r\nthis quiet place. I little dreamed of meeting you here; I need not say I\r\nam delighted: I am, thoroughly so. I find you looking your best, yet I\r\ncan easily perceive you have been hard at work as usual. I do not\r\nbelieve you could possibly keep still and rest, even for one short week,\r\nlet the inducement to do so be ever so great. And now, my dear Fillmore,\r\nsince I have, so to speak, brought myself up to date for your benefit,\r\nmay I ask for a similar service on your part?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLINES OF A GREAT PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nFillmore Flagg, seemingly self absorbed, remained silent for some\r\nmoments, softly stroking his chin with his strong, shapely hand, his\r\ndreamy eyes with far-off vision intent, apparently noting details in the\r\nhazy borders of the distant landscape. At last, turning to his friend\r\nwith a hearty hand clasp he said: \"George Gaylord, I congratulate you;\r\nyour future is bright; you deserve it, your mother deserves it. The\r\nfates have been very generous with you. I am glad you are content to\r\naccept the good things of life which they bring to you.\r\n\r\n\"As for myself, my lines of life are cast in swift waters. My\r\nenvironments, in their reaction upon me from within, seem to develop a\r\ndetermined will to wrench from the rocks of destiny by ceaseless and\r\npersistent effort, whatever gifts I am to possess or enjoy. Work I must.\r\nObstacles seem only to stimulate my ambition to overcome them. Yet I am\r\npassionately fond of the beautiful; poetry, music and art in all the\r\nloveliness of its varied forms; they affect me profoundly. This poetic\r\nside of my nature I inherit from my dear, devoted mother--my highest\r\nideal of all that is good, lovely and angelic in woman. Sadly and often\r\nhave I missed her loving tenderness, her watchful care, her beautiful\r\nsmile. The shadowy Angel of Death claimed her and bore her from my sight\r\nwhen I was but four years old. Young as I was at that time, this\r\nbeautiful world has never seemed quite so bright to me since.\r\n\r\n\"My father, Fayette Flagg, was a noble man of sterling worth. He\r\nbelonged to a class of thrifty, hard-working, pioneer farmers, on the\r\nbroad, fertile prairies of the state of Nebraska. Until the death of my\r\nmother he was happy and prosperous, hopeful, helpful and brave. After\r\nthat great blow came to him, he recovered slowly, as from a long, severe\r\nillness and never again was quite so courageous and strong, or as\r\nhopeful as before.\r\n\r\n\"With the advent of the last decade of the nineteenth century a feeling\r\nof foreboding unrest seemed to brood over the western farmer: blight and\r\ndrouth destroyed his best crops just when they seemed to promise most;\r\nfarm stock had to be reduced. The good years were few, the bad years\r\nwere many. The great strain of carrying a large outfit of expensive\r\nagricultural machinery which on a small farm could be used with profit\r\nonly from ten to forty days in the year, began to be felt. The debts,\r\nincurred by the purchase of the machinery, were growing steadily larger.\r\nWith each renewal of the mortgage on the farm, came the demand for a\r\nbonus and a higher rate of interest. Meanwhile the price of land and of\r\nall farm products kept on falling, falling steadily year after year.\r\nOnly taxes and freight rates from farm to market kept up. High rates of\r\ninterest and of freight swallowed up everything and seemed to accelerate\r\nthe terrible shrinkage of values. My father found, to his amazement,\r\nthat his farm was now mortgaged for more than it would sell for under\r\nthe hammer. He gave up the struggle in despair. The savings of a\r\nlifetime, his health, strength and courage all exhausted; his homestead\r\nand farm sold from under him; he lost all hope and in a few short weeks\r\ndied, a broken-hearted man. I went to him a few months before the end: I\r\ntried all in my power to save him, but alas! I could do nothing but bury\r\nhis body beside that of my mother and come away, filled with the\r\ndetermination of solving the most difficult problem of a lifetime--a\r\nproblem that lies at the very foundation of the permanency of this\r\nrepublic. 'How to keep the farm lands of America in the hands of the\r\nnative farmers of this and the coming generations? How to help them to\r\nhelp themselves?' The decree has gone forth. The small farm and farmer\r\nmust go. They are doomed. A great wave of land monopoly, rolled up by a\r\nlarge class of very shrewd, far-seeing capitalists, is even now sweeping\r\nacross the continent. Seventy-five years hence only a pauperized\r\npeasantry of ignorant farm laborers, bound to the soil as hopelessly as\r\nthe slave to the master, will coin their lives of ceaseless, unrequited\r\ntoil to swell the rent roll of the non-resident landowner, who, as lord\r\nof the domain, through his heartless agent, will exact his tribute to\r\nthe uttermost farthing. Must the sons and daughters of the farms of this\r\nrepublic come to the bitter heritage of such a life? Surely! We have\r\nalready seen the beginning of the end! The sad case of my father can be\r\nduplicated a hundred times or more in almost every county of our western\r\nstates. States that are incalculably rich in their magnificent domain of\r\nbroad acres of the most fertile land the sun ever shone upon; capable,\r\nwhen permanently placed in the hands of a properly equipped,\r\nscientifically educated class of people, of producing the food supply of\r\nthe world: but under the blight of the monopoly system, history will\r\nrepeat itself. Our agricultural interests will languish and wither;\r\ndependent manufactures, and all branches of exchange and commerce, must,\r\nin time, follow. What then will happen to society? To government of both\r\nstate and nation? In the face of this appalling situation, how\r\nstupendous the problem! By what effort can a great counter tidal-wave be\r\nset in motion upon whose crest the salt and salvation of the republic,\r\nthe sons and daughters of American farms, may be carried safely to the\r\npermanent heritage of the soil they till? As in the past, so in the\r\nfuture must we look to them for our true reformers, leaders, thinkers\r\nand statesmen. They are endowed by birth, by constant association in\r\nyouth with soil and sunlight, fields and grass, green meadows and mossy\r\nbrooks and, best of all, doubly endowed by the inbreathing of ozone\r\nladen breezes from mountain and forest, with that rare combination of\r\nnerve, moral, mental and physical stamina, courage and patriotism which\r\nis necessary to preserve this republic and to keep it, ever and always,\r\na model of progressive excellence for all the nations of the earth. This\r\nmeans the embodiment by them of more and better mind, that they may do\r\nbetter, wiser and more dominant thinking; be able to comprehend the sum\r\nof human knowledge to such an extent that they may add to it; to so\r\nunderstand their lives, and their relations to the Universe around them,\r\nthat they may become masters of themselves and their environments--a law\r\nunto themselves--fitting them for a perfect citizenship of a perfected\r\nrepublic. This most desirable of all accomplishments, requires better\r\nsurroundings, more leisure and opportunity for self-improvement, more\r\nmoney, shorter hours of more remunerative labor--labor transformed from\r\na hated drudgery to a desirable occupation. Behold, friend Gaylord, you\r\nhave before you the outlines of the problem. Can you suggest anything\r\ntowards its solution?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can suggest nothing,\" said George Gaylord; \"You have stated the case\r\nwith the clearness and eloquence of a Henry George. If what you say is\r\ntrue, the problem is a very serious one. But are you quite sure the\r\nfacts will fully warrant your conclusions? If so, what are your plans\r\nand what have you been doing towards working out this puzzling\r\nquestion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"I am very sure of my position. The more\r\nI study the question, the firmer my conviction that I have understated\r\nthe case instead of overstating it. I am studying the agricultural\r\nquestion from every possible standpoint and I propose to make it a life\r\nwork. Every branch of science may aid me; I must master at least a\r\nportion of each. Since we left college I have become fairly proficient\r\nin surveying and civil engineering; have devoted considerable time to\r\nphotography; I am classed as a skilled electrician; I have thoroughly\r\nmastered agricultural chemistry and several of the more important\r\nbranches of that interesting and most wonderful science. As you know, I\r\nam very fond of mechanics and of all kinds of machinery. I could not\r\nrest until I had gained a practical knowledge of all kinds of tools and\r\nlearned how to repair or construct most kinds of machinery. Two months\r\nago I completed a general course of study at the Philadelphia School of\r\nIndustrial Art, which, for the especial work I have in view, I consider\r\nby far the most beneficial and practicable of all my acquirements. I am\r\nnow resting, cogitating and waiting for the golden opportunity which,\r\nsooner or later, must come, to enable me to commence my work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAN ADVERTISEMENT INTRODUCES THE HEROINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"By the way, I have something to show you. I clipped this advertisement\r\nfrom a leading New York daily paper this morning, and have read it\r\ncarefully many times. Somehow, I have an abiding conviction that it will\r\nlead me to the high road, on the way towards the successful solution of\r\nmy problem. I am going to apply in person.\"\r\n\r\nFull of curiosity, George Gaylord took the clipping and slowly read\r\naloud:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"WANTED: A skilled mechanic, qualified to act in the capacity of\r\n     landscape gardener and agricultural chemist. Applicant must be a\r\n     strong, healthy young man, of good habits, pleasing address; with a\r\n     general knowledge of business methods, and an excellent moral\r\n     character. Qualifications must be well attested by recommendations\r\n     from reliable parties. A graduate of the Philadelphia School of\r\n     Industrial Art is preferred. Salary liberal. Apply in person at the\r\n     office of\r\n                 BITTERWOOD & BARNARD, Atty's.,\r\n                   Atlantic Building, Washington, D. C.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This is curious! It seems to point directly to you, Fillmore. I do\r\nwonder in what peculiar capacity you are to act, and who your real\r\nemployer is to be? I shall be full of unsatisfied curiosity until I know\r\nthe sequel.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment George Gaylord was suddenly interrupted by an\r\nunlooked-for gust of wind whirling around the shoulders of the big rock\r\nstanding above and behind them. The fluttering paper slipped from his\r\nfingers and went sailing away over the tree tops, down the mountain\r\nside, with that erratic up and down, eddying motion peculiar to run\r\naway, fly away papers. In an instant both young men were upon their\r\nfeet, intently watching the uncertain flight of the clipping. A few\r\nmoments later it fell to the ground, just at the feet of two ladies who,\r\nwith heads protected from the sun by large parasols, were slowly walking\r\naround the bend of the broad, well kept road, winding down the mountain\r\nside. The younger of the two ladies picked up the advertisement,\r\nhurriedly scanned it, and then raised her eyes to discover the two young\r\nmen as probable owners of the truant paper.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said George Gaylord, \"I recognize those people. It is Miss\r\nFenwick and her travelling companion. Come along Fillmore, let us join\r\nthem at once and claim your lost clipping. The opportunity for an\r\nintroduction to two very interesting ladies, who are among the most\r\nnoted guests of the hotel, is too good to be lost.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly they hurried down the steep path that joined the road near\r\nwhere the ladies were still waiting, at a point full three hundred feet\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nApproaching, with hats in hand, George Gaylord said: \"Allow me, Miss\r\nFenwick, to introduce to you my friend and college chum, Fillmore Flagg:\r\nfor a peculiar purpose of his own he wishes to regain possession of that\r\nflighty paper which, fortunately for him, the prank playing wind carried\r\nto your feet but a moment ago.\"\r\n\r\nWith a slight inclination of her queenly head, she turned with a\r\ndazzling smile to meet the inquiring glance of Fillmore Flagg. In a\r\nclear musical voice, full of thrilling cadence and power, she said: \"Mr.\r\nFlagg, if you are particularly interested in this paper, I am very sure\r\nI am quite happy to meet you, and take pleasure in returning it to you\r\nnow; I trust that we may have the opportunity of becoming better\r\nacquainted before you leave these lovely mountains.\" Turning to her\r\ncompanion she continued: \"Permit me, gentlemen, to introduce my friend\r\nand companion, Mrs. Bainbridge; Mr. George Gaylord, who is just entering\r\nthe ministry, and his college friend, Mr. Fillmore Flagg.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bainbridge responded with a pleasant smile. She was a tall, well\r\nformed, well preserved woman of forty; full of a quiet dignity, with an\r\nair of refinement that fitted her like a garment. Her heavy dark hair,\r\ncoiled high on her shapely head, was just slightly silvered with gray\r\nand seemed to be a fitting foil to her large melancholy black eyes--eyes\r\nthat from their slumbering depths seemed to impress the beholder with\r\nsuggestions of some mysterious power, gleaming messages, like beacon\r\nflashes, from her inner life. With her becoming dress of rich, dark\r\ncloth, gloves and parasol to match, she looked the cultured lady to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nTurning her steps up the mountain, Fern Fenwick said: \"Gentlemen, as it\r\nis near the hour for supper, we had best return to the hotel at once. I\r\nthink too, by this time the mail from the station must have arrived.\"\r\nFillmore Flagg was at her side in an instant, choosing the side opposite\r\nthe parasol, which gave him a clear view of her charming profile. George\r\nGaylord and Mrs. Bainbridge followed a little more slowly. The\r\nconversation soon became animated.\r\n\r\nWhile they are thus occupied let us try to get a more complete picture\r\nof Miss Fern Fenwick. Her round, exquisitely proportioned figure was of\r\nmedium height, straight as an arrow, full of grace with every movement.\r\nHer quick, firm, elastic step was Youth personified: a charming maiden,\r\nshe, of twenty summers. The artistic outlines of her plump arms and\r\nshoulders, beautifully modelled bust, throat and neck, so admirably\r\nproportioned, would have satisfied the most carping critic; poet or\r\npainter, he would have pronounced them a dream of perfect symmetry. Her\r\nqueenly shaped head, so gracefully poised, like a clear cut cameo, was a\r\npoem of intellectual development on lines of rarest beauty. Her thick,\r\nglossy hair of dark chestnut brown, fine as spun silk and inclined to a\r\nwavy crimp, was artistically coiled in a most becoming style; small ears\r\nof perfect shape, and transparently pink, were set close to the head.\r\nThe curve of the brow, in perfect line with the pleasing oval of both\r\ncheek and chin; a Grecian nose and cherub mouth completed the perfect\r\ncontour of a face and head of marvellous beauty--a beauty made more\r\nbrilliant by large, lustrous eyes of blended sapphire and amethyst,\r\nflashing jewels of deep violet blue, so clearly expressing the varying\r\nemotions by their ever changing tints of sparkling light. Her dress, a\r\nclose fitting gown of rich, soft, silver gray material, was stylishly\r\nmade, with a narrow line of lovely lace at the throat; perfect fitting\r\ngloves of the same shade of gray, with a parasol to match, completed a\r\ncostume that seemed to bring out and intensify a most charming\r\ncomplexion of pale pink and white, faultlessly smooth and transparently\r\npure: at once indicative and prophetic of a strong vital temperament,\r\nperfect mental and physical health; pure, highly cultured mind and a\r\nwealth of personal magnetism--that silent charm of mysterious\r\npotency--pervading and surrounding her like the perfume of sweet\r\nflowers, winning the unsought admiration, friendship and fidelity of all\r\nwho came within the radiance of her powerful magnetic aura. All this,\r\nand more, Fillmore Flagg perceived and felt. He walked and talked as one\r\nin a dream. Never before had he met so fair a vision of female\r\nloveliness, with grace so winning, gestures so perfect and voice so\r\nmusical. His heart, overflowing with a new ecstatic emotion, paid silent\r\nhomage to this queenly creature. He was lost in admiration. Swallowed up\r\nand absorbed by the first incoming wave of a great love. He was lifted\r\nout of himself, above and beyond all gross things of earth, into a\r\nheaven of pure delight. His better nature was thrilled and profoundly\r\nmoved. He felt that in the presence of this pure, angelic woman he\r\ncould never again do an unworthy act. A life work, up to the standard of\r\nhis highest ideal, was a tribute of devotion he would willingly lay at\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\nAll too soon for Fillmore Flagg the moments flew by. Almost before he\r\nwas aware of it they were ascending the steps of the hotel. Pausing on\r\nthe broad veranda for a moment before separating, Fern Fenwick said:\r\n\"Gentlemen, Mrs. Bainbridge and myself have planned for a carriage drive\r\nto-morrow to Sam's Point. We have two seats in our conveyance at your\r\ndisposal and would be delighted to have you accompany us. May we hope\r\nthat you both can come with us?\"\r\n\r\nFillmore Flagg and George Gaylord both eagerly accepted the invitation,\r\nthe ladies passed on to their rooms, while the young men turned their\r\nsteps once more to the rustic bench to enjoy the magnificent sunset view\r\nof the landscape they had so much admired earlier in the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF A STONE AND WHAT CAME AFTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSam's Point, the crowning backbone of the highest mountain in the\r\nShawangunk range, bends away from the general course of its fellows\r\napparently for the especial purpose of giving the mountain climber, by\r\nits isolation, a commanding view in almost every direction except to the\r\nnorth-east. For miles in extent the flat, rocky top of this crown forms\r\na promenade of magnificent proportions up amid the clouds. In shape it\r\nis a long, slender triangle, about three miles from its base westward to\r\nthe point where its highest altitude is reached, two thousand three\r\nhundred and forty feet above tide-water. Cradled in its rocky bosom,\r\nnear the base of the triangle, lies a crystal lake--one hundred and\r\nfifty acres of sparkling water. At this point the promenade is fully\r\nthree-fourths of a mile wide, gradually narrowing to a width of less\r\nthan one hundred feet at the extreme point. The long battlemented sides\r\nof this lofty triangle, like some mighty fortress, grim and frowning,\r\nare protected and supported by perpendicular cliffs of black rock,\r\nrising like some bastioned wall of terrifying proportions, two hundred\r\nfeet above the shoulder of the mountain. In a sheltered nook, near the\r\npoint, about five hundred feet below the base of the cliffs, stands the\r\nSam's Point Hotel, scarcely more than a cottage in size. Here Fern\r\nFenwick's party left the carriage. Taking the narrow, zig-zag pathway\r\nthat led to the cliffs and often pausing to admire the immensity and\r\ngrandeur of the black rock palisades towering so far above them, they\r\nsoon found themselves under the nose of the point of rocks. Entering the\r\ncrevice in the cliffs known as \"The Chimney Stairway,\" they commenced\r\nthe steep and toilsome climb to the summit; Fillmore Flagg taking the\r\nlead and assisting Miss Fenwick, George Gaylord performing the same\r\nservice for Mrs. Bainbridge; fifteen minutes later they stood, almost\r\nbreathless, upon the summit, the blue sky all about them, a precipice on\r\neither hand where shimmering, giddy space seemed to yawn so frightfully\r\nnear. Meanwhile a strong, buffeting wind tugged at ribbons and capes,\r\nhats and bonnets, so furiously that walking was hazardous; it gave one\r\nsuch an uneasy sensation of giddiness and unstable equilibrium\r\ngenerally, that the temptation to fly over the edge of the cliff was\r\nhard to resist. A huge egg-shaped boulder, twenty-five feet in height\r\nand as large as a house, poised rather unsteadily on its rounded base,\r\nwas quite near and gave promise of protection from the violence of the\r\nwind. With one accord our party scrambled towards it, the ladies\r\nclinging tightly to their escorts with one hand, a firm grip on hat or\r\nbonnet with the other. Thus sheltered, and more at ease, they slowly\r\ndrank in the glorious vision which greeted the eye on every hand.\r\nLooking down as from a balloon, at the foot of the mountain, on the\r\nnorth side, the eye was charmed by the length and beauty of the Rondout\r\nValley, through which ran the Delaware and Hudson Canal, and the Rondout\r\nRiver. For miles on either side of canal and river the valley was made\r\nmore lovely by its checkered farms and gleaming white villages. Directly\r\nat the foot of the mountain on the south side, the broader valley of the\r\nWallkill presented an equally beautiful and diversified picture of farm,\r\nhamlet and village. Beyond these, in every direction save to the\r\nnorth-east, vast stretches of country lay spread out like a map; the\r\nmountains far and near, so dwarfed as to give to the surface the\r\nappearance of billowy plains, almost level where they approached the\r\nedge of the horizon. The wonderful extent and scope of the view was\r\nbounded by the line of the horizon, at least one hundred miles distant.\r\nThree-fourths of this sweeping circle responded to the unaided vision,\r\ndisclosing the blue hills and hazy mountain peaks located in five\r\nstates: New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut and\r\nMassachusetts, altogether presenting in its immensity a landscape as\r\nvariegated and charming as it was wondrously beautiful and attractive--a\r\nmarvellous picture of indescribable loveliness never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"How inspiringly magnificent!\" said Fillmore Flagg: \"All the sublimity\r\nof my nature is satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Fern Fenwick, \"am too profoundly impressed to talk. I\r\nwould that I could spend hours here in silent admiration.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said Mrs. Bainbridge, \"that we would better move further back\r\non the rocky summit where doubtless, sheltered seats may be found, then\r\nwe can all enjoy this most wonderful of views at our leisure and with\r\nsome degree of comfort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said George Gaylord, \"that will be ever so much nicer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop a moment,\" said Fern Fenwick, who for some moments had been\r\nexamining the huge boulder which sheltered them, \"Have you noticed the\r\ncurious formation of this immense stone? How many hundreds of tons it\r\nmay weigh, I hardly dare guess. Geologically speaking, it is a 'stranger\r\nrock,' not in any way related to the rocks of this mountain, nor of the\r\nmountains near here. It is a mammoth conglomerate of such an\r\ninterestingly curious compound and of such flinty hardness. At the time\r\nof its formation enormous pressure, coupled with the most intense heat,\r\nmust have molded this strange mass together. Coarse and fine gravel,\r\nsmooth, round pebbles, from the size of a pigeon's egg to that of a\r\ntwo-hundred-pound boulder, are all jumbled together in great confusion,\r\nand so firmly cemented in this immense globular mass of that peculiar,\r\ntenacious clay of greenish gray color, which forms so large a part of\r\nthe drift formation, and which is so widely distributed over the face\r\nof our globe--that strange, unaccountable, isolated and unrelated\r\nformation, which still remains an unsolved puzzle by our best\r\ngeologists. I wish you to observe the long sides of this strange rock,\r\nespecially where the exposed sides of the pebbles have been worn down\r\nsmooth and even with the clay--how they are marked and striated by\r\nshallow grooves, all running in one direction as straight as though\r\ngraven by rule. Is it possible that any freak or flood of the glacial\r\nperiod could have floated this huge rock to its resting place on the\r\nvery summit of this high mountain, almost two thousand five hundred feet\r\nabove the level of the sea? Oh! tell me, ye listening mortals, or ye\r\nwinged winds that blow and pull my ribbons so! whence came this stranger\r\nrock? how formed? and how were its smooth, worn sides so systematically\r\nengraved?\"\r\n\r\nFern Fenwick closed her series of queries with a gradually rising pitch\r\nand inflection in the ringing tones of her clear, musical voice. With\r\nfigure erect, eyes flashing, cheeks glowing and hands uplifted, she\r\nseemed the personification of some priestess of science. Fillmore Flagg\r\nand George Gaylord gazed at her with the admiration of amazement. Mrs.\r\nBainbridge exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Why Fern Fenwick! How you do go on with such nonsense, to be sure. No\r\ndoubt these gentlemen, from this time forward, will look at you as some\r\nscientific freak or geological professor of the female persuasion, but\r\nrecently escaped from the walls of some famous college!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Bainbridge,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"of course we understand that\r\nyou were joking in what you said just now: that you really admire the\r\nterse, clear, and wonderfully complete description of this strange rock\r\nby Miss Fenwick, quite as much as we do.\" Turning to Fern Fenwick, he\r\ncontinued: \"I believe, Miss Fenwick, that I can throw some light on the\r\npuzzling questions you have so poetically propounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray do tell us, Mr. Flagg,\" said Fern Fenwick; \"I can't remember when\r\nI was so excited with interest on any subject before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Fillmore Flagg: \"That curiously able and intellectual\r\nman, Mr. Ignatius Donnelly, in his very interesting book called\r\n'Ragnarok,' or 'The Age of Fire and Gravel,' puts forth a most\r\nremarkable theory regarding the drift formation, to the truth of which\r\nthis huge rock seems to bear witness. The theory, briefly stated, is as\r\nfollows: A great many ages ago, when this globe of ours was still in the\r\nperiod of cataclysms, rolling through space around the sun, it came in\r\ncontact with a portion of the end of the tail of some enormous comet,\r\nsweeping through the universe on its erratic course. This great boulder\r\nis a sample of the component parts of that fiery tail, which smote the\r\nexposed face of the earth so terribly with the drift deposit at that\r\ntime of dire disaster. The age of fire and gravel, surely! This curious\r\nclay, now of such flinty hardness, was at one time the exceedingly fine\r\ndust of the comet, cohering, collecting and embedding its mixture of\r\npebbles and gravel by the heat and pressure of the friction caused by\r\nits incalculably swift passage through space for periods of uncounted\r\nages. Remember that the heat of all drift material in the tail of the\r\ncomet was greatly intensified by the explosion of accompanying gases as\r\nthey came in contact with the atmosphere of our earth. All inflammable\r\nmaterial on the face of the globe, which was exposed at the time of its\r\npassage through the tail of the comet, was burned up: both earth and sky\r\nwere on fire! Fortunately our flying globe made a quick passage, thus it\r\nhappened that large portions of its unexposed surface wholly escaped\r\nthis terrible downpour of fire and gravel, and the absence of all drift\r\ndeposit on these places is logically accounted for. The atmosphere, so\r\nheated during that awful period, drank up the waters of the earth--then\r\ncame the floods, as the waters fell again. Then followed the reaction\r\nperiod of extreme cold, snow and ice--the glacial period. This\r\nparticular rock, while following in the train of its parent comet,\r\nthough lagging many thousands of miles behind, still, being so very\r\nlarge, moved with accelerated speed towards the comet's head, passing on\r\nits way countless millions of smaller particles, whose cutting edges\r\nscored these grooves. On entering the earth's atmosphere, on account of\r\nits great size, this boulder, through the law of attraction, quickly\r\nmoved to the outermost fringe of the comet's tail nearest the earth,\r\ntherefore was the first to alight on the top of this mountain, far away\r\nfrom all smaller drift material.\r\n\r\n\"I hope, Miss Fenwick, that my brief and rather speculative answers to\r\nyour questions, reasoning as I did, from Mr. Donnelly's point of view,\r\nmay prove at least in a measure satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Flagg,\" said Fern Fenwick, \"your answers to my questions\r\nhave all been very ingenious: equally interesting and satisfactory,\r\nespecially as to how this mammoth conglomerate came by its grooved lines\r\nand, later how it managed to find a resting place on this mountain top,\r\nso far from its kind. Mr. Donnelly's theory of accounting for the\r\nwidely scattered deposits of the drift formation is the most reasonable\r\nand logical of anything I have ever read or heard. Doubtless, in course\r\nof time, it may be proven the only true one. I see Mr. Gaylord and Mrs.\r\nBainbridge are becoming weary of all this talk about rocks: let us move\r\nfurther back from the point in search of more sheltered and comfortable\r\nseats.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly they chose the central path and were soon seated, enjoying\r\nthe changed landscape from a new point of view. However, Mr. Gaylord was\r\nnot yet satisfied and soon proposed a walk to the lake. Mrs. Bainbridge\r\nwas willing but Miss Fenwick had walked enough for one day. A quiet\r\nenjoyment of her lofty outlook was what she now most desired.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Fern,\" said Mrs. Bainbridge, \"Mr. Gaylord will accompany me\r\nto the lake and we will bring back for lunch some of those very large,\r\ndelicious blueberries, which Mr. Gaylord assures me are growing so\r\nabundantly around the shores of the lake. You and Mr. Flagg shall remain\r\nhere with the lunch baskets.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan was agreed to, and very soon Mrs. Bainbridge and her escort\r\nhad disappeared on their way to the lake. To Fillmore Flagg it seemed a\r\nlong time that Fern Fenwick had been sitting so quietly, apparently\r\nabsorbed in admiring the billowy miles of landscape unrolled so far to\r\nthe southward. In reality, each was thinking of the other.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Flagg,\" said Fern Fenwick slowly, \"will you pardon me for asking\r\nyou some very abrupt questions, or what may seem such when considering\r\nour brief acquaintance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"I hope my replies this time may prove\r\nas satisfactory as those I gave in regard to the rock. The pardon you\r\ncrave is granted in advance. Pray proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Mr. Flagg, why are you so much interested in that\r\nadvertisement which came to me so unceremoniously yesterday? And again,\r\ntell me why you are so moved and determined to better the conditions of\r\nfarm life? I suppose you know that I have wealth and leisure at my\r\ndisposal; it may prove that I can be of great assistance to you. This is\r\nmy excuse for asking you for more details in regard to your personal\r\nplans.\"\r\n\r\nWith a heart filled with hope, Fillmore Flagg began the recital of the\r\nstory he had given to George Gaylord on the terrace bench. With frequent\r\nglances of encouragement from Fern Fenwick, his inspiration and\r\neloquence grew upon him. He gave a masterly statement of the work, his\r\npreparation, hopes and plans. Delighted beyond measure with the\r\nundisguised appreciation and approval of this charming woman, whose very\r\ndestiny in the vista of a coming future, seemed to him to be linked in\r\nsome mysterious manner with the success of his most cherished ambitions,\r\nhe cleverly enlarged and perfected the original statement. As he\r\nconcluded, Fern Fenwick rose to her feet with hands extended, her face\r\nglowing with interested enthusiasm, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Flagg, I most heartily congratulate you on the noble life-work you\r\nhave planned and chosen, I thank you again and again for the valuable\r\nfacts you have placed so confidingly in my possession, in regard to\r\nyourself and your work. Rest assured my interest and assistance\r\nhenceforth are at your command. You will understand this more clearly\r\nwhen I tell you that Bitterwood & Barnard are my attorneys, and the\r\nadvertisement which played such an important part in bringing us\r\ntogether here in these mountains, was drawn up by them for my purposes.\r\nThat it should bring to me a person of your wonderful ability,\r\nintegrity, skill and knowledge, is an almost unhoped for piece of good\r\nfortune. You are the one, of all others, most eminently fitted to help\r\nme to a successful solution of my problem, which you have so admirably\r\nstated. Hereafter I am your debtor. I hope to prove a not unworthy\r\nemployer, or, to put it more pleasantly, an interested co-worker. Will\r\nyou do me the favor of considering yourself as pledged from this moment\r\nto take up my work? Go at once to my attorneys in Washington, ask them\r\nfor a letter of introduction to me, that you may get more complete\r\ndetails of my plans and work, saying not a word of our present\r\nacquaintance. I will furnish you with a check on my Washington bankers,\r\nwith which to defray your expenses. To-morrow, in company with Mrs.\r\nBainbridge, I go to my summer home on the Hudson near Newburgh, where\r\nletters will reach me. This is the twenty-eighth of August; on the fifth\r\nof September, at noon meet me in the station at Newburgh. Come prepared\r\nto devote a week at the least in discussing the scope and plan of our\r\nwork, devising ways and means etc. I very much desire that you have an\r\ninterview with my father, I know he will be pleased with you. Do these\r\narrangements suit your convenience? Do they meet your entire approval?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am greatly elated,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"at this my golden\r\nopportunity of commencing what you have so kindly named as 'our' work,\r\nunder such auspicious circumstances. I thank you, Miss Fenwick, more\r\nthan words can tell, for your confidence in my integrity and ability, I\r\nwill do my best to retain that confidence. I am ready to start for\r\nWashington to-morrow. I will follow your instructions, and will report\r\nto you by letter from that city, and then meet you at Newburgh at the\r\nappointed time.\"\r\n\r\nAs he finished his reply Fern Fenwick said: \"Mr. Flagg, I am very much\r\npleased with your prompt decision in favor of my arrangements. I see our\r\nfriends returning from the lake, will you help me to spread the lunch?\"\r\n\r\nWith keen appetites they enjoyed the lunch especially the delicious\r\nblueberries which George Gaylord and Mrs. Bainbridge had brought from\r\nthe lake. The hours passed quickly; the drive back to the hotel was\r\nwithout mishap or incident: the entire party, on separating, voted it a\r\nday of perfect pleasure, Fillmore Flagg and George Gaylord expressing\r\ntheir thanks to the ladies for their kind invitation which had given\r\nthem such a delightful excursion.\r\n\r\nLater, George Gaylord called at the room of his chum for a few moments\r\nchat. \"Come in,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"I was just thinking of you. I\r\nhave made up my mind to go to Washington to-morrow for the purpose of\r\nanswering that advertisement. How much longer do you propose to remain\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more than two weeks,\" replied George Gaylord. \"I understand Miss\r\nFenwick and Mrs. Bainbridge are going away to-morrow. I am likely to\r\nhave a very quiet time, all by my lone self: I think I must take to\r\nbowling for an hour or two each day just to keep up my exercise and kill\r\ntime. I hope you may be entirely successful in your interview with\r\nBitterwood & Barnard. Remember how much I am interested in this matter,\r\nand your promise to let me know the result. By the way, what a perfectly\r\ndelightful day we have had, thanks to that lucky gust of wind which\r\ntore your clipping from my fingers and landed it at Miss Fenwick's\r\ndainty feet. What a talented young lady she is, and so handsome too. Her\r\nlecture on the mountain top about that stone would have been a credit to\r\nany one. I never saw her look such a picture of perfect beauty before.\r\nShe seemed wonderfully interested in you, Fillmore, especially after\r\nyour brilliant reply to her series of apparently unanswerable questions.\r\nI declare, the profoundness, the ingeniousness, and the boldness of your\r\nsuccessful answers filled me with amazement! You fairly surpassed\r\nyourself; all the time looking your best, just like a hero. Yet when you\r\nlooked at Miss Fenwick you seemed just at the point of falling down to\r\nworship her. I can't blame you. What a glorious couple you two would\r\nmake! If it were not for her immense wealth I believe you could win her;\r\nany one can see that you have made a very favorable impression. Perhaps\r\nyou can win her as it is--I wish you all success, you certainly deserve\r\nit. Mrs. Bainbridge tells me that at the death of Miss Fenwick's father,\r\nsome years ago, she became sole heir to his vast fortune; most of it in\r\nvery rich Alaska gold mines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite sure,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"that her father is dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes Fillmore, I am quite sure; although it is just possible that I may\r\nhave misunderstood Mrs. Bainbridge. In my hotel acquaintance with that\r\nlady I discover that she is a very intelligent and accomplished person\r\nof rare good sense. Splendid company; we seem to get on famously\r\ntogether, I shall miss her very much I am sure. As usual, I am doing all\r\nthe talking: it is now your turn to say something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I could,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"if my chatterbox friend,\r\nGeorge Gaylord, would only give me a chance. Miss Fenwick I regard as\r\nthe most beautiful and cultured woman I have ever met. I do admire her\r\nvery much, but the possibility of ever winning her for a wife is, at\r\nthis time, too remote for me to consider for a moment. I must now pack\r\nmy trunk and then see the hotel clerk about getting it to the railway\r\nstation. So good night, George, I will see you again in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nThat night Fillmore Flagg could not sleep. The beautiful image of Fern\r\nFenwick was before him the moment he closed his eyes. The events of the\r\npast two days, with their crowding memories, kept racing through his\r\nmind: he could not think calmly or connectedly. He was in a fever of\r\nexpectancy regarding the meeting at Newburgh, and the prospect of\r\nspending a whole week at Miss Fenwick's cottage on the Hudson. Then and\r\nthere, no doubt, she would tell him all about herself, her father, her\r\nparticular work, when and why she became interested in it etc. But what\r\nabout the father? How could he have an interview with her father, if\r\nMrs. Bainbridge was correct in saying that Mr. Fenwick had been dead for\r\nseveral years? It was a mystery he could not solve. He did not doubt\r\nFern Fenwick for a moment and felt sure she would, at the proper time,\r\nmake everything plain. How gracious and winning she had been to him; she\r\nseemed to bid him to have courage. In spite of her great wealth, and a\r\nhundred other obstacles that might exist, he was more and more in love\r\nevery hour. If proving himself worthy of her confidence in every way\r\nwould win her love, surely then, he would win it. With this\r\ndetermination fixed in his mind he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nIn her room that night, as Fern Fenwick brushed her hair and prepared\r\nherself for rest, she often paused to ponder over her strange meeting\r\nwith Fillmore Flagg; thinking what a fine, manly looking fellow he was,\r\nand how well he could talk; how thoroughly equipped he was to take up\r\nthe question of improving farm life, the lives of farmers and their\r\nfamilies--the question of all questions for her. Surely, Mr. Flagg bore\r\nthe stamp of destiny! He was the man of all men to make her work a\r\ncomplete success. How fortunate she was to secure his valuable services.\r\nHow strange, that after a brief acquaintance of only two days, she\r\nshould have such perfect confidence in a comparative stranger. Yet, she\r\ndid not doubt his integrity; she knew he was loyalty itself; she\r\nintuitively felt that she could trust him implicitly--he would never\r\nbetray her interests under any circumstances. She knew from his every\r\nlook, tone and gesture that he admired her intensely, devotedly. Her own\r\nfeelings, she did not care to analyze. With a sigh, more of pleasure\r\nthan weariness, she composed herself for the night and was soon lost in\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nFAIRY FERN COTTAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne week has passed since the events narrated in the previous chapter.\r\nAt Cornwall on the Hudson, on a West Shore train speeding north, we find\r\nFillmore Flagg; his mission at Washington successfully accomplished, the\r\nletter of introduction from Bitterwood & Barnard secured. In another\r\nshort hour he will be at Newburgh. Will the lovely face of Fern Fenwick\r\nbe the first to greet him? As the moments fly by, his heart beats\r\nfaster. He feels the surging tide of his all-absorbing love for this\r\nbeautiful woman, thrilling and permeating his entire being. He tries to\r\nbe calm, to think what he ought to say that would be fitting and\r\nappropriate; he knows his eyes are blazing and his cheeks glowing with\r\nan unwonted fire, still his thoughts refuse to flow into the satisfying\r\nforms of speech he most desires to use at the coming meeting, which\r\nseems to him to be the marking of a great crisis in his life. Ah! There\r\nis the whistle sounding! The speed of the train is checked as it\r\napproaches the station. He steps on to the platform while the train is\r\nstill moving. He beholds many upturned faces in the surging crowd\r\nbetween him and the doorway of the ladies' waiting room, but Miss\r\nFenwick he cannot see. Will he ever reach that room? Has anything\r\nhappened to her? A great fear contracts his heart, he fancies he fairly\r\nstaggers as he enters the door. In an instant he is suffused with a\r\ngreat joy. By the window, awaiting his approach, stands Fern Fenwick,\r\nthe perfect picture of cool, contented loveliness. She extends her hand\r\nand greets him with a firm clasp of hearty welcome, and a second edition\r\nof that dazzling smile, so becoming to her, so bewitching to him.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. Flagg? I believe your train must be late. How well\r\nyou are looking, in spite of the heat and the dust! We will have your\r\nbaggage secured as soon as possible and placed in the carriage, then we\r\nwill drive to the cottage in time for lunch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you Miss Fenwick, I am delighted to see you looking so well. My\r\njourney from Washington has been a very pleasant one; I have enjoyed it\r\nand have not suffered from the heat.\"\r\n\r\nThe carriage now came up, they stepped in and commenced the beautiful\r\ndrive of one and one-half miles to \"Fairy Fern Cottage,\" which was\r\ncharmingly located on the summit of these famously terraced hills. Hills\r\nthat have been historic since the revolutionary days of General\r\nWashington, when their slopes were white with the tents of his soldiers.\r\nAs they approached the cottage, the artistic eye of Fillmore Flagg noted\r\nwith pleasure the broad expanse of spacious lawn, gently sloping down to\r\nthe road. Half-moon-shaped, it presented for his admiration five acres\r\nof smoothly shaven, velvety green. For one-eighth of a mile, the entire\r\nwidth of the lawn and cottage grounds, a low wall of ornamental cut\r\nstone separated the lawn from the road and formed the straight line of\r\nthe half-moon. From the gates at either end of the wall a broad,\r\nbeautifully kept driveway swept around the semicircle of the lawn,\r\npassing just in front of the cottage at the center of the deep bay of\r\nthe half-moon. On each side of the driveway the greensward was\r\nbeautified by alternating star and diamond-shaped plots of geraniums,\r\nroses, gladioluses, canna and nasturtions. Sitting close to the outer\r\nedge of the drive, about ten feet apart, commencing at the corners of\r\nthe porch on either side, were rows of potted palms extending around the\r\ncurve, one hundred and fifty feet each way--the palms gradually growing\r\nsmaller as the distance from the cottage became greater. The effect was\r\nbeautifully unique and suggestively semi-tropical. The cottage and lawn\r\nwas embayed by a crowning crescent of choice foliage and shade trees;\r\nthe thin horns of the crescent terminated at the gateways in low gray\r\nstone towers. From these points the horns gradually grew broader and the\r\nshrubbery rose higher. First the rhododendrons mixed with clumps of\r\nhollyhocks, next flowering almonds, roses, spireas and syringas; then\r\ncame the drooping long leaf sugar pines, with an artistic mingling of\r\nslender limbed graceful silver birches: farther back were the taller\r\nfirs and spruces, interspersed with thick clumps of small copper\r\nbeeches, extending to and joining at the back of the cottage, the dense\r\nforest of tall, straight bodied elms, oaks and maples which partly hid\r\nand shaded the stables and the kitchen portion of the cottage.\r\n\r\nThe cottage itself was built of gray stone; with thick walls and large,\r\nlow, deep seated windows. It was two stories in height, with three\r\nsquare towers rising twenty feet higher. The central tower was larger,\r\nand gave space within its walls for one grand room of magnificent\r\nproportions, thirty feet square and with a fifteen foot ceiling. The\r\ngeneral effect of the cottage, lawn, and crescent background of foliage\r\nand forest, was as novel as it was beautiful. As the carriage entered\r\nthe farther gateway, Fillmore Flagg was surprised and delighted:\r\n\r\n\"How perfectly exquisite!\" he exclaimed: \"A real gem! A romantic scene\r\nfrom fairyland! Rightly named 'Fairy Fern Cottage!' It is a fitting home\r\nfor Fern Fenwick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Flagg,\" said Fern Fenwick as they stepped from the\r\ncarriage to the porch: \"I appreciate your praise of my cottage home. I\r\nlove it, I am proud of it, I give you a hearty welcome to its halls. May\r\nyour memories of it prove always pleasant. Let us enter. During your\r\nstay you are to occupy the front room on the second floor, the one\r\nunder the right hand tower. I think you will find the view from the\r\nwindows very pleasing and attractive. The luncheon bell will sound in\r\njust half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nIn the dining room Fillmore Flagg found Mrs. Bainbridge who greeted him\r\nvery cordially. She sat at the left of Fern Fenwick, who was at the head\r\nof the table. The table itself was oval shaped, very large, seemingly of\r\nrich, solid mahogany; the china and silver were elegant and artistic.\r\nThe center piece was a large silver tray filled with a wonderful\r\ncollection of rare ferns. Around it a ring of cut glass bouquet holders,\r\nfilled with spikes of flaming gladioluses, formed a most effective\r\nborder.\r\n\r\n\"You are to sit here at my right, Mr. Flagg,\" said Fern Fenwick.\r\n\r\nAs Fillmore Flagg took the proffered seat, he thought her a most\r\ncharming hostess, admirably fitted to preside over this exquisitely\r\ndecorated table. He looked in vain for her father; finally concluding\r\nthat Mr. Fenwick must be a confirmed invalid, confined to his room.\r\nLuncheon over, Fern Fenwick invited Fillmore Flagg to her study to\r\nconsider the business of the work before them. Her study proved to be\r\nthe large square room in the central tower, which was so generously\r\nlighted by its eight large windows. The furniture was of carved oak; the\r\ncarpet and hangings, rich and heavy, were of a pale lilac tint, which\r\ngave an air of peaceful quiet and harmony to the room. From the front\r\nwindow, looking eastward, a long stretch of the beautiful Hudson could\r\nbe seen at one sweeping glance. In the south east corner of the room\r\nstood Fern Fenwick's desk, a large one with a roll top. At the right of\r\nthe desk, on an easel against the wall, was a very fine, life size\r\ncrayon portrait of a noble looking man of sixty winters or more. The\r\nmassive forehead was both broad and high and very smooth. The eyes were\r\nwide apart, large and expressive, the full beard, thick and fine; the\r\nhair, abundant and wavy. Both hair and beard were evenly tinged with\r\ngray. The body was large, erect and well proportioned--it fittingly\r\nmatched the noble head. The portrait impressed one as being life-like\r\nand full of character. Close beside the easel was a large arm chair,\r\nupholstered with stuffed leather, a grayish brown. Lying across the arms\r\nof the chair was a large, peculiarly shaped trumpet of aluminum,\r\nornamented with a heavy cord and tassel of gray silk.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Flagg,\" said Fern Fenwick, \"this is my private workroom; here I am\r\nundisturbed and not at home to callers. This is my desk. Here you see my\r\nfather's portrait: this is his favorite chair. Will you be seated in the\r\nsmaller chair near it? I will sit in the chair at my desk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Miss Fenwick,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"Up to this time I had\r\nthought of you as living here with your father: I now perceive, from the\r\nway you speak of his portrait and of his favorite chair, that he must be\r\ndead. Please correct me if I am wrong in my conclusions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will explain the situation in a very few words,\" said Fern Fenwick.\r\n\r\n\"In the eyes of the world I am an orphan, my father and mother having\r\nboth passed from this to the land of spirit. The world, in its blind\r\nignorance, calls them dead. To me, thanks to my mediumship, and to the\r\nmighty truth of spirit communion, they are still conscious, living,\r\nloving parents. Every day, here in this room, they come to me and\r\nthrough the trumpet there, speak to me as naturally, as fluently and as\r\nlovingly as ever. I feel and realize their constant watchfulness and\r\nloving care. In times of need their advice never fails, always proving\r\nas wise as it is unerring. They never for a moment allow me to realize\r\nthat I am an orphan in any sense of the word. The word Death has no\r\nterrors for me: I realize that for them it means simply a happy\r\ntransition to a higher life, filled with broader and brighter\r\npossibilities; and, blessed truth! that they are permitted to come to me\r\nwhen I need them. I sometimes shudder when I think what might have\r\nhappened to me if I had not been born and bred a spiritualist and a\r\nmedium. However, we will speak of these things more at length later on.\r\nAt this time, under my father's guidance and with your assistance, I am\r\nto carry out and complete his plans for the improvement of farm life on\r\nlines quite in harmony with your ideas. I know he approves of you and of\r\nyour work, and has confidence in your integrity and ability. At the\r\nproper time he will speak to you personally through the trumpet. Let us\r\nnow consider another matter pertinent at this time.\r\n\r\n\"In order that you may thoroughly understand the situation that\r\nsurrounds and affects our work, it will be necessary for me to tell you\r\nthe story of my life, and with it the story of the life of my father.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFENNIMORE FENWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On a pioneer farm in northwestern Iowa, with a broad expanse of\r\nbeautiful prairie on every side, far from town or village, lived my\r\ngrandfather, George Fenwick. On this farm in October, 1840, my father,\r\nFennimore Fenwick, was born. Of a family of nine children, five boys and\r\nfour girls, he was the fifth, two of the brothers and two of the sisters\r\nbeing older. Closely associated as a healthy, harmonious family of\r\nchildren, they grew up surrounded by the conditions of an isolated farm\r\nlife, so general in the widely scattered settlements of those early\r\ndays, with only now and then rare chances for a little schooling of the\r\nmost primitive character. However, they shared with each other their\r\njoys and sorrows, their plays and privations; always forbearing and\r\npatient, kind and affectionate, light-hearted, sympathetic and helpful,\r\nthey did much to develop that broad, loving, genial nature which made my\r\nfather kin to all mankind. So just and true! So nobly unselfish! A\r\nsignal illustration of the great blessing which Nature's beneficent law\r\nof compensation brings to large families.\r\n\r\n\"Passing on to September, 1865, at the close of the war of the\r\nrebellion, we find the large family, so long and harmoniously united,\r\nnow separated and widely scattered. Grandfather and grandmother Fenwick\r\nboth died during the closing year of the war. With the exception of my\r\nfather, the brothers and sisters were all married and settled on farms\r\nof their own: some in Iowa, one in Missouri, two in Kansas, and two in\r\nMinnesota. The homestead was divided between the two younger brothers.\r\nAll of the brothers served as soldiers, good and true, during the war;\r\nthe two younger only one year each. My father, more fortunate than the\r\nothers, by his bravery and soldierly excellence won a commission, and\r\ncame home the captain of his company.\r\n\r\n\"From this point forward we will follow my father's career as he makes a\r\npathway in life for himself.\r\n\r\n\"From 1865 to 1871 he devoted his time and his savings to hard study in\r\nthe best of schools, finishing a master of his profession--a mining\r\nengineer and expert in assaying and metallurgy. From 1871 to 1882 he was\r\ngeneral manager of a wealthy mining company in Colorado at a large\r\nsalary, making a name for himself as one of the most skillful and\r\nsuccessful men in the profession. While in Colorado my father was\r\nhaunted by an intuitive feeling that the gold-bearing quartz region of\r\nAlaska held a rich find in store for him. In October, 1882, a very\r\nstrong corporation was organized in San Francisco, 'The Alaska Mining\r\nCo.,' to open and operate their extensive mines in Alaska. The directors\r\nof the company chose my father manager. They offered him an increased\r\nsalary to go to Alaska to take entire charge of the work. This position\r\nhe accepted and retained for five years. During that time he discovered\r\na very rich mine on a small, rocky island near the coast. In partnership\r\nwith his old friend, Mr. Dunbar, one of the San Francisco directors of\r\nthe Alaska Mining Co., my father, at the end of five years service for\r\nthe company, had developed the mine on the island into one of the best\r\npaying and most extensive of that famously rich gold bearing quartz\r\nregion. This was the foundation and support of his vast fortune, which\r\nthereafter required his entire attention. At the death of Mr. Dunbar,\r\nwhich occurred in 1890, his one-third interest in the mine passed to his\r\nson, Dewitt C. Dunbar, a young man of great energy and integrity, with\r\nan excellent business education. He impressed my father as one in every\r\nway trustworthy and capable. At my father's request, Dewitt C. Dunbar,\r\naccompanied by his young wife, at once removed to Alaska. Under my\r\nfather's tuition he began to prepare himself to take the active\r\nmanagement of the mine, which had been christened 'The Martina.'\r\n\r\n\"In 1882, while on his first visit to San Francisco, my father met and\r\nloved Martina Morrison, my mother--my beautiful mother. She was\r\ntwenty-seven, my father forty-two. They were perfectly adapted to each\r\nother, and both equally charmed and devoted. She possessed a fine mind,\r\nwell cultured; a handsome physique, charmingly graceful in every\r\nmovement; and, her crowning glory, an exceedingly amiable disposition.\r\nMartina Morrison, by those who knew her longest and best, was declared\r\nto be the soul of honor. She was an excellent medium, an enthusiastic\r\nand devoted Spiritualist--one of its purest and most eloquent exponents,\r\nhighly esteemed by all as an able and earnest worker in the service of\r\nthe two worlds. Fennimore Fenwick, my father, soon became much\r\ninterested in her wonderful mediumship, and later became convinced of\r\nthe absolute verity of the mighty truths of Spiritualism. He at once\r\ndeclared himself its willing and outspoken advocate: in his enthusiasm\r\nof delight he even hailed it as the coming religion of the world.\r\n\r\n\"Martina Morrison had such confidence in my father's future mining\r\nsuccess, that she readily yielded to his urgent request for a speedy\r\nmarriage, that she might accompany him on his first trip to Alaska. And\r\nthus it was they sailed away on their bridal tour, their destination\r\nthat far off land of flashing glacier and unexplored forest, almost, if\r\nnot quite, beyond the borders of civilization. This long voyage to an\r\nunknown country had no terrors for them. They were all the world to each\r\nother. A bright halo of hope and happiness spread a soft glow of\r\nenchantment over ship and sail, sea and sky, so vivid, so far reaching,\r\nthat it even touched and tinted the distant shores of that far off, rock\r\nbound coast of Alaska. Smooth seas, lovely weather and favoring winds\r\nspeeded the voyagers: those halcyon days flew swiftly by. Almost before\r\nthey dreamed it possible the vessel came to anchor in the port that\r\nmarked the end of the voyage. Safely landed, my father reported at once\r\nat the office of The Alaska Mining Company, only a few miles distant.\r\nThere he commenced his five years of management for the Company, of\r\nwhich I have already spoken. There my mother remained until December,\r\n1884, when she returned to San Francisco, to visit her friends. My\r\nfather followed her five months later.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nAN ALASKA KINDERGARTEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In June, 1885, I was born, and soon became a very active member of the\r\nFenwick family. I was pronounced by all who saw me an offspring in every\r\nway worthy of my noble father and my beautiful mother. When I was two\r\nmonths old, my parents returned to Alaska, taking me with them. There I\r\nremained until I was seven years old--seven years in that forbidding\r\nclime, so near the Arctic Circle. Isolated from other children, yet how\r\nhappy and contented I was. Those years recall a troop of joyous\r\nmemories, with not a bitter one to mar the group. My beloved parents\r\nwere my only companions, playmates, teachers and confidants. I was\r\npapa's own girl. He was very proud of me and wished me to be with him as\r\nmuch as possible. He never wearied in the endless task of answering my\r\nquestions, always so skillfully directing them by suggestions, that in\r\nmy receptive mind there was soon unfolded a clear conception of the\r\noutlines of the different branches of all useful knowledge. When I was\r\nfour years of age I knew the alphabet perfectly and could spell and\r\nconstruct a great number of words with my lettered blocks, and then copy\r\nthem on my slate. When I was five years old, thanks to my mother's\r\npatient teaching, I could read fairly well. My father's ingenious\r\nmethods soon made me familiar with the key-words of geology, chemistry,\r\n(including the names of minerals, metals and gases) botany, history,\r\ngeography, physics and astronomy. I was unconsciously taught to\r\nassociate these words or names with the groups, or families, to which\r\nthey belong. I would spend hours with my father in the most delightful\r\ngame of separating and classifying a miscellaneous heap of different\r\ncolored blocks, bearing the names of minerals, metals and gases and the\r\nkey-words of the studies I have just mentioned. To illustrate: The\r\nastronomy blocks were blue with the names in white letters; the geology\r\nblocks were a deep reddish brown, with names in gray; chemistry, red,\r\nlettered in black; botany, green, lettered in yellow; geography, gray,\r\nlettered in blue; history, black, lettered in red; physics, a deep\r\norange yellow, lettered in white; mathematics was represented in a small\r\nway by the cipher and nine digits, lettered in black upon ten plain\r\nunpainted blocks, giving in their forms that number of the principal\r\ngeometrical figures, to which was added a shallow box with a broad lid,\r\nperforated by ten holes, corresponding to the blocks in number, size and\r\nshape, but large enough for the blocks to easily pass through into the\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n\"In these groupings my childish interest and delight was intensified by\r\nmy father's personification of the different families, such as: 'Mr.\r\nAstronomy Blue,' 'Mrs. Geology Brown,' 'Mr. Chemistry Red,' etc. For\r\ninstance, the wonderful stories he told to me of the minerals, metals\r\nand gases--the sons and daughters of Mr. Chemistry Red, as he termed\r\nthem--describing their loves and hates, the great variety of pranks they\r\nplayed, the queer combinations they entered into, the good and the bad\r\nwork they performed, etc. These to me were fairy stories of the most\r\ncharming kind, while at the same time they gave me a correct idea of the\r\npowers and properties of these unfamiliar things and served to identify\r\nthem more closely as members of the chemistry family. My mother was a\r\nnatural teacher, very proficient in botany, and in history, with its\r\nflower and fruitage of classic prose and inspiring poetry. She entered\r\ninto my father's 'block-signal-system' of education with an enthusiasm\r\nas zealous and childish as my own, therefore her contributions to the\r\nrapidly increasing store of blocks were large and exceedingly\r\ninteresting. Her stories regarding the numerous members of the botany\r\nand history families proved equally profitable and charming; those about\r\nplants and trees especially so. These stories and plays of science\r\ngrouping, always associated with such pleasant emotions of my childish\r\nheart, became permanently fixed and dominant in my mental growth,\r\nforming separate brain structures around which the details of the\r\naccumulated knowledge of future years could easily and naturally\r\nclassify and crystallize.\r\n\r\n\"Thus swiftly passed those happy years of my early girlhood. So\r\nconstantly was I associated with my dear father and mother that schools\r\nI did not need. In my seventh year, under their supervision, I commenced\r\na systematic course of scientific reading which I kept up until after I\r\ngraduated from college. I commenced with the Science Primer Series,\r\nreading aloud to my parents one half hour each morning and evening,\r\nconversing and commenting on the different topics as we went along. This\r\nproved to be a continuation of the game of blocks: just as interesting,\r\nequally entertaining; all about the same familiar families. I enjoyed it\r\nso much and never once dreamed I was accomplishing a great deal of good\r\nhard study. To me it was play; play that gave me more pleasure than any\r\nof my childish sports. I soon began to ask for an extension of the half\r\nhour lessons to an hour each; when my request was granted my cup of\r\npleasure was full, my joy complete. With each succeeding week my\r\ninterest in all my studies continued to grow. Yet my health remained\r\nperfect: my physical kept an even pace with my mental growth, largely\r\nowing, no doubt, to the much enjoyed hours of good romping exercise and\r\nthe dancing and singing which followed my reading lessons.\r\n\r\n\"You must pardon me, Mr. Flagg, if I should tire you with such a\r\ndetailed account of my child life; my excuse must be, the valuable hints\r\nit may offer when we come to consider a school system for the children\r\nof our model co-operative farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am profoundly interested,\" said Fillmore Flagg. \"The very wonderful\r\nresult flowing from the wise methods conceived by your parents and\r\ncarried out by them so devotedly, fills my mind with admiration and\r\noffers a flood of suggestions as to the possibilities of what may be\r\naccomplished by a properly conducted, well equipped school on a\r\nco-operative farm. But you must not allow me to interrupt--please\r\nproceed with your very interesting story.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nAN INTERVIEW WITH THE \"FAIRIES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFern Fenwick rose from her seat saying: \"As it is near sunset, Mr.\r\nFlagg, I have something to show you in the way of a surprise, which I\r\nwish you to see before it becomes too dark: after having seen it you\r\nwill better understand why this house was named 'Fairy Fern Cottage.'\r\nTherefore I propose that we now adjourn to the cool shade of the grounds\r\nat the rear of the cottage, postponing the recital of the remainder of\r\nmy story until this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be delighted to follow you,\" said Fillmore Flagg. \"You have\r\nexcited my curiosity; I am just in the mood to learn all I can about\r\nthis lovely cottage and its beautiful surroundings.\"\r\n\r\nAs they reached the shady lawn, so cool and sweet from its recent\r\nsprinkling, Fillmore Flagg observed that a wide, straight avenue, shaded\r\nby towering oaks and widely branching elms, led from the rear porch of\r\nthe cottage to the broad front of the roomy stone stables, some two\r\nhundred and fifty feet distant. In the center of this avenue, with a\r\nfinely graveled carriage drive on either side, rose a long line of huge\r\nstone arches, ten in number. These imposing structures of solid masonry\r\nwere full thirty feet high, spreading to a width of thirty feet at the\r\nbase. The two center arches were each twenty feet thick; the others, ten\r\nfeet each. The open space between the arches was uniformly ten feet; the\r\nopen circle under each arch was twenty feet in diameter. The vista\r\nformed by the spaces and arches together, was over two hundred feet in\r\nlength. From the farther arch to the front of the stables lay thirty\r\nfeet of smooth, clean gravel which covered, at this point, the full\r\nwidth of the avenue, seventy-five feet, forming the open court, around\r\nwhich was built the stables and the two tastefully designed stone\r\nbuildings on either side--one, beautifully fitted up for the residence\r\nof the superintendent, the other containing the heating and pumping\r\napparatus and the electric generator. The two wide center arches\r\nsupported the huge metal tank which held the ample water supply of both\r\ncottage and outbuildings. Evidently, they were admirably adapted to that\r\nparticular purpose. The rough stone work of the outside of all the\r\narches was artistically covered and beautified by a luxuriant growth of\r\nintermingled ivy and cinnamon vine, which gave a still deeper shade to\r\nthe interior. To the beholder, the exterior effect of the vines on the\r\nlong line of arches was as beautifully romantic as if it really were one\r\nof those old Abbeys in picturesque ruin, so charmingly described by Sir\r\nWalter Scott. Deep grooves in the stone work, with light iron frames\r\nfastened near the outer edges of the arches, gave support during the\r\ncold weather to a roof of double glass, which covered all the open\r\nspaces between the arches, converting the whole into one vast\r\ngreenhouse, through which passed the system of heating pipes from the\r\nfurnace room to the cottage, thus providing a roomy winter home for an\r\narmy of tropical plants and shrubs and at the same time protecting the\r\nwater supply from the ill effects of all frost. A screen of interlacing\r\nvines, in place of the glass roof, now served to make the shade of the\r\narchway almost complete.\r\n\r\nHaving sufficiently examined the exterior and becoming to some extent\r\nfamiliar with the general plan and purpose of these unique arches,\r\nFillmore Flagg and Fern Fenwick returned to the covered entrance from\r\nthe kitchen porch. Here, as they were standing a few feet above the\r\nground, they had an unobstructed view of the interior of the archway.\r\nThrough the center, where the lower disc of the open circles touched the\r\nground, ran a deep bed of coarse gravel, covered with a thick layer of\r\nsmooth round pebbles, forming a perfectly drained pathway about three\r\nfeet in width which extended uniformly from one end of the archway to\r\nthe other. Conforming to the contour of the arches, rising and receding\r\nin unison, this pathway was bordered on either side by what appeared to\r\nbe a continuous terrace of three stone benches, each one foot high and\r\nof the same width. These benches really were very heavy square terra\r\ncotta pipes, ingeniously cemented together with telescopic joints, and\r\nhaving thick, grooved covers which formed the protecting conduits for\r\nthe wires of the lighting system and the pipes of the irrigating and\r\nheating apparatus.\r\n\r\nArtistically arranged on these benches, in pots that were beautifully\r\nmodeled, colored and glazed, was a wonderful collection of choice ferns,\r\nembracing all of the known varieties in prodigal profusion. The pots\r\nwere so arranged that the smaller varieties occupied the lower benches,\r\nwith the larger ones in gradually increasing sizes on the higher benches\r\nfarther back. Viewed from either end of the archway they formed two\r\nmatchless banks of the rarest verdure and the loveliest foliage\r\nthe world ever saw. Everywhere the eye was delighted by great\r\nmasses of drooping fronds of delicate green, like rare lace in\r\nfineness--outrivaling in beauty the plumes of the famous birds of\r\nparadise.\r\n\r\n\"This is simply superb!\" exclaimed Fillmore Flagg. \"I never saw anything\r\none half so lovely! Shall we walk through now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment, Mr. Flagg,\" said Fern Fenwick. \"The twilight shadows are\r\nso deep you have, as yet, caught only a glimpse of the rare beauty of my\r\nlovely ferns.\" Stepping quickly to the right side of the first arch, she\r\npressed a button and lo! those wonderful banks of ferns, and all the\r\nspace of the archway, was flooded with a glory of soft, clear light. A\r\nthousand tiny bulbs, in a lovely variety of flower and fern leaf\r\npatterns, gleamed and glowed from beneath the ferny banks or hung\r\npendant, rainbow like, from the roof of this rock ribbed archway.\r\n\r\nHeld spellbound for some moments by his surprise, admiration and\r\ndelight, Fillmore Flagg murmured softly, almost in a whisper: \"Can\r\nanything surpass this vision of perfect beauty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Fern Fenwick, radiant and smiling, \"I think it can be\r\nsurpassed, but we must allow the enchantress to use her magic once more,\r\nby giving my darling ferns their bath of beauty. Then you shall see them\r\nin their diamond robes.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, she pressed another button. A thousand tiny pipes,\r\nconcealed in the ribs of the stone roof, gave forth a shower of fine\r\nspray, filling the long fernery with a hazy mist of cobweb fineness.\r\nVery soon millions of globules of moisture gathered on leaf, stock,\r\nfrond, plume and tiny tip of every leaflet, reflecting each ray of light\r\nwith diamond-like brilliancy. Pressing another button to shut off the\r\nspray, Fern Fenwick said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Flagg, my ferns have donned their royal robes and are ready\r\nfor your tour of admiring inspection. I assure you they are worthy of\r\nit. As a choice collection of ferns in such perfect condition, its equal\r\ncannot be found in all the wide world! As a collector I am an\r\nenthusiast; for many months I have travelled far and wide in my efforts\r\nto add new specimens of rare beauty to the original collection. You may\r\nguess how much I prize it when I tell you that money could not buy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are surely a most wonderful enchantress,\" replied Fillmore Flagg.\r\n\"I feel that under the potent spell of your magical wand, I have entered\r\nthe inner mysteries of some glorious temple of ferns, in a world of\r\nenchantment! I am so fascinated and dazzled by this marvellous display\r\nof brilliancy and beauty, that I am moved to pay homage to you, Miss\r\nFenwick, as a fitting tribute of loyal devotion to Fern, the Fairy Queen\r\nof this fair temple.\"\r\n\r\nAs he finished his gallant speech, the deep tones of emotion vibrating\r\nin the full rich voice of Fillmore Flagg, and the look of intense\r\nadmiration which shone so eloquently from his eyes, brought a flush of\r\ncolor to the fair face of Fern Fenwick and warned her that it was time\r\nto be moving. Skillfully keeping up the personification, she quickly\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Flagg, I am delighted on behalf of the fairies to express thanks\r\nfor the glowing tribute to their Queen which you have so beautifully\r\nvoiced. Let us now walk through to the end of the fernery and return. As\r\nwe pass along I will point out my favorite plants.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a few steps had been taken when Fillmore Flagg paused, listening\r\nand looking about him in all directions, with a very puzzled expression.\r\nA delightfully cool breeze was fanning their faces: this breeze was\r\nladen with some strangely sweet perfume both soothing and stimulating to\r\nthe senses. The air all about them seemed to vibrate with the distant\r\nmelody of some angelic music, now sinking, now swelling in perfect\r\nharmony; so soft, so clear, so bright, so inspiring in its wealth of\r\ntone and joyous movement.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Miss Fenwick,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"my senses are all entranced!\r\nYour wonderful fairies in this grotto of magic are at this moment\r\nthrilling my being with sensations of the most intense delight! How can\r\nthe Fairy Queen explain? What has she been doing with her magical wand\r\nto produce such delicious perfume; such entrancing music?\"\r\n\r\nFern's merry laugh rang out musically clear, and her eyes sparkled\r\nroguishly as she replied: \"I assure you Mr. Flagg, that in this instance\r\nthe fairies are not responsible. The explanation is quite simple but\r\nrather long. Therefore let us move forward while I give you the details:\r\nAs we were stepping down on this graveled walk, I turned the switch and\r\nstarted the ventilating fans, at the same time connecting the electric\r\ncurrent with a series of melophones located near the top of the arches.\r\nAlong the ventilating tubes, in a series of small compartments, are\r\nsponges saturated with different kinds of perfume. These sponges can be\r\nexposed to the air current or withdrawn at will, yielding a single\r\nperfume or a blending of as many kinds as one may wish. The wonderful\r\nvariety of these choice blendings, which can be so easily produced,\r\naffords a constant succession of sweet surprises. The melophones which\r\nyou hear, represent the highest achievement of art in the production of\r\nautomatic musical instruments. This set is the most complete and the\r\nmost expensive one in existence. In construction and final completion\r\nthey cost the inventor and maker three years of constant thought and\r\nlabor. The result is truly marvellous. The perfection of harmony and\r\npurity of tone are convincing testimonials of their excellence. In\r\noperation these instruments are placed in a very large double tube made\r\nfrom a peculiar kind of metallic alloy recently discovered, which\r\naffords the most perfect conditions for the conservation and\r\nconductivity of all musical vibrations. They are capable of producing an\r\nalmost endless variety of choice music. The selection which we hear at\r\nthis time, is one which I have re-named 'The Carol of the Ferns.' Pardon\r\nme, Mr. Flagg, if in my enthusiasm over the beauties of what you have so\r\npoetically termed my 'magical temple of ferns,' some of my statements\r\nshould sound like boasting; I assure you they are not so intended. I\r\ntrust that now I have cleared up the mystery to your perfect\r\nsatisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charmingly,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"Nevertheless my fairyland illusions\r\nstill abide with me; I confess I am still under the spell of the great\r\nhappiness they have given to me--I shall never forget it. The truth in\r\nthis case proves even stranger than fiction; I quite agree with you that\r\nin all the wide world there is nothing like this! It seems to me that\r\nthose extraordinary melophones yield the finest music I have ever heard.\r\nIn sweetness and purity of tone, softness and wealth of harmony, which\r\nis pervaded by some electric quality of inspiration, so stirring, so\r\nthrilling that every nerve and every cell in the body responds. They\r\nstand unrivaled as the very acme of musical art. I now understand why\r\nyour lovely home here should be named 'Fairy Fern Cottage.' I fully\r\nappreciate the significance of the title. This royal temple of ferns\r\nmakes the name most fittingly appropriate, and easily ranks this cottage\r\nas the eighth wonder of the world! The fame of its rare beauty should be\r\nknown in every land. You ought to be very proud of it. I assure you,\r\nMiss Fenwick, that you are abundantly justified in praising it\r\nenthusiastically at all times, without fear of being considered\r\negotistical. But tell me, if I may be permitted to ask, who was the\r\nwonderful genius who first conceived and planned the building of this\r\nimposing line of arches? So useful, so ornamental, so unique, yet so\r\nperfectly adapted as a summer and a winter home for your ferns and\r\nflowers and, withal, offering such a perfect title to your unrivaled\r\ncottage home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Flagg, for that question. In my reply I am eager to pay\r\na deserved tribute to the dearest and noblest of men--my father.\r\nInspired by his love for me, his brilliant mind conceived the entire\r\nplan and purpose of this curiously novel structure. He succeeded in\r\ncompleting it and also in filling it with the original collection of\r\nferns, without my knowledge. On the morning of my fifteenth birthday,\r\nhe brought me here to bestow upon me this priceless gift. The surprise\r\nwas a perfect one. When he made me understand that he gave with it a\r\ndeed to the cottage and grounds, the surprise became so intense that it\r\nfairly took my breath away. I was so overjoyed that by turns I laughed,\r\nand cried, and hugged papa, until I came very near to having a genuine\r\nfit of hysteria! At that time we changed the name of the house to Fairy\r\nFern Cottage. This is why I am so proud and so fond of my cottage home.\r\nThis is why I appreciate your praise of it so much--why I am so thankful\r\nfor it. I feel sure that you will now appreciate my sincerity when I\r\nrepeat that money could not buy it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM VS. A GOOD MAN WHO IS AS RICH AS HE IS NOBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter supper Fern Fenwick and Fillmore Flagg returned to the tower room\r\nfor the continuation of the story. She began by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Let us return to my father's mining operations in Alaska. In 1892,\r\nDewitt C. Dunbar assumed the active management of the Martina mine. A\r\nlarge proportion of my father's surplus capital from the mine had been\r\ninvested, through trusty agents, in the cities of San Francisco, Saint\r\nPaul, Chicago, Washington and New York. We at once planned a tour of\r\ntravel that would give him the opportunity to personally inspect these\r\ninvestments, and at the same time give me a chance to see the world,\r\nand to mingle in society, or so much of it as a continuous hotel life\r\nmight offer.\r\n\r\n\"For my mother and myself this delightful tour was one long holiday. We\r\nenjoyed it so much. To me especially, it proved exceedingly profitable;\r\ngeographically speaking, my ideas of the largeness of the world, and the\r\nvast number of its people, were wonderfully expanded. In December, 1893,\r\nfather completed his investments by the purchase of a winter home in the\r\ncity of Washington, and this summer home here. This cottage was built in\r\nthe year 1900.\r\n\r\n\"During the summer of 1894 we visited the brothers and sisters of my\r\nfather, who were at that time living with their families on farms in\r\nIowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri. As was generally the\r\nrule, with a large class of farmers in those states at that time, we\r\nfound them, with but few exceptions, poor, in debt, and very much\r\ndiscouraged by the menacing outlook for the future. Farm interests\r\neverywhere were in a desperate condition. A succession of twenty years\r\nof falling prices for all farm products, accompanied by frequent\r\ncalamities, such as hail storms, hurricanes, hot, blighting winds,\r\ndrouth and armies of grasshoppers, had so multiplied and magnified the\r\nfarm debts, and so reduced the value of farm, stock, and product, that\r\neven the interest on the indebtedness could no longer be kept up; ruin\r\nand beggary threatened the entire community of farmers. Under the severe\r\npressure of these conditions, great numbers of the more unfortunate\r\nabandoned their farms in despair and sought employment elsewhere, mostly\r\nin manufacturing centres and the large eastern cities. Much of the money\r\nand wealth of the land had flown to those points, thither logically,\r\nthey followed, to enter the ranks of that vast army of competitors for\r\nthe crumbs that might fall from the table of an already glutted labor\r\nmart; to learn by bitter experience how cruelly the system of\r\ncompetition in all kinds of business can grind the helpless poor; to\r\nlearn, through years of suffering, the real meaning of competition, that\r\nso long as it rules over commercial and industrial systems, the rich\r\nmust grow richer and fewer in number, while the poor must grow poorer,\r\nand more and more numerous; to apprehend, slowly and painfully, that by\r\ncoming from farm to city they had still farther congested the already\r\noverstocked labor market, thereby adding fierceness to the competition,\r\ninsuring an increase in the purchasing power of the dollars of those who\r\nheld the labor market, while they correspondingly decreased the\r\npossibilities for earning the dollars they must have in order to live;\r\nto perceive dimly in their desperation, that congestion of the labor\r\nmarket speedily affected all markets; that an overstocked labor market\r\nalways meant a decrease of wages, which in turn, caused a corresponding\r\nshrinkage in the number of purchasers for all salable goods in the\r\ngeneral market, followed by increased panic and stringency in the money\r\nmarket; which speedily rolled up another disaster, sweeping in turn,\r\nadditional thousands into the ranks of the unemployed; demonstrating,\r\nfinally, that a repetition of these evils is inevitable; that\r\ncompetition in its last analysis, means the complete destruction of all\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\"As my father came to understand the full significance of this\r\ndeplorable situation, involving and distressing his own brothers and\r\nsisters, his noble nature was grieved and shocked. He made haste to\r\nplace his people in a condition of financial independence. How happy and\r\ngrateful they were! And my father rejoiced with us that he was able to\r\noffer such timely assistance. He then announced to us his determination\r\nto devote the remainder of his life, and so much of his fortune as might\r\nbe necessary, to the solution of the problem of how best to overcome the\r\nblighting evils of the competitive system. After much thought, long\r\nresearch and hard study, he decided to commence with the land as the\r\nnecessary basis of all progress; with the farm as the rational\r\nprogressive unit; with improved farm methods on co-operative lines, as\r\nthe lever by which to restore the control of the land to the farmers,\r\nand to lift them and their sons and daughters from the class of ignorant\r\ndependents, to a class of cultured independents, which should be well\r\nworthy of serving as a model in the race of progress, for all the other\r\nclasses. In his efforts to modify, correct, and reform social and\r\nbusiness methods, he proposed to use the strong and kindly arms of\r\nCo-operation in fighting the evils of Competition, or its\r\nrepresentative, the pitiless competitive system. He reasoned that all\r\nforms of government are but the result of co-operative effort. Both\r\nexperience and observation had taught him that the measure of excellence\r\nof any government is the measure of its perfection in co-operation.\r\nTherefore it logically follows, that the more perfect the co-operation\r\nachieved by the administration of any form of government, the greater\r\nthe degree of justice and equality attained in the distribution of\r\nbenefits to all of the governed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE REAPING OF THE DEATH ANGEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Towards the close of the summer of 1895, my father placed me in the\r\npreparatory department of Vassar College, where I made rapid progress. I\r\nbegan to appreciate the superior wisdom of the methods of teaching which\r\nmy parents had so systematically carried out for my improvement. Thanks\r\nto their efforts, I held the key to all of the sciences, history and\r\nliterature, prose and poetry! All of their principal words or terms with\r\ntheir definitions, were familiar friends to me; while all new facts\r\nregarding their various subdivisions, auxiliaries, etc., and the\r\nrelations existing between them as such, were matters of absorbing\r\ninterest to me; so much so, that I soon became master of the subject I\r\nwas studying, very often proving a puzzling surprise to my teachers. At\r\nthe age of twelve I entered the regular course and graduated from\r\ncollege just as I was entering my eighteenth year, being by four years\r\nthe youngest member of a graduating class of one hundred girls.\r\n\r\n\"Some months after my fourteenth birthday, my darling mother was taken\r\nfrom me in the mortal form, very suddenly and most unexpectedly. My\r\nfather was away from home on a long trip to Alaska. I was at Vassar. My\r\nmother was with a congenial party of friends at a favorite seaside\r\nresort. One day while bathing, one lady of the party swam too far out,\r\nwas taken with a cramp and shrieked for help. My mother, who was\r\nnearest, being an excellent swimmer, courageously went to her\r\nassistance. Unfortunately, the tide was running full and strong and was\r\nagainst my mother in her heroic struggle to save her friend. Alas!\r\nbefore aid could reach them both sank beneath the waves and were lost.\r\nMy noble mother had generously sacrificed her earthly existence in her\r\nbrave effort to save the life of another! This was my first experience\r\nof the grief and desolation that follows the reaping of the Death Angel.\r\nIn my youth, my half-dazed condition, I could neither realize nor\r\nunderstand what later became so plain to me; that to die is to live\r\nagain. That death, so-called, is but the change from one form of life to\r\nanother, which is still higher in the scale of progress. Nor could I\r\nthen realize, that for the purpose of bringing to me a consciousness of\r\nthe possibilities of my spiritual being; under the ministrations of the\r\nangel of compensation, out of the very depths of the gulf of bereavement\r\nand sadness through which I was passing, there was coming to me the\r\nprecious gift of a priceless mediumship, the marvelous key! the\r\nall-potent 'open sesame' with which to unlock the gates between the two\r\nworlds and reunite the separated loved ones on either side.\r\n\r\n\"At that time Mrs. Bainbridge, then but recently widowed, was in charge\r\nof the old home here. She was an excellent medium who had often proved\r\nherself worthy of my mother's entire confidence. Acting under the\r\nguidance of my arisen mother, she at once, without hesitation, took\r\ncharge of all business arrangements, especially those of preparing for\r\nthe cremation of my mother's body, in accordance with her often\r\nexpressed wish. She telegraphed the sad news to my father in Alaska,\r\nasking for instructions. He replied at once that the body must be\r\ncremated, as my mother had directed in her will. He would return as soon\r\nas possible, but at the best he could not hope to arrive in less than\r\ntwo months. In the meantime, Mrs. Bainbridge was authorized to take\r\nentire charge of 'Fern,' and of his business affairs that needed\r\nattention, until he came.\r\n\r\n\"I came home from college, sorely grieved and shocked at the awful\r\nsuddenness of my mother's transition, but through the mediumship of Mrs.\r\nBainbridge, my mother, having her in a deep trance, was soon able to\r\ncomfort me; to make me realize that she was not dead, but still near me\r\nwith all a mother's love and tender care. From time to time she directed\r\nMrs. Bainbridge how to manage the pressing business that came up. She\r\ntold me that she had long known that I was endowed with wonderful\r\nmediumistic power, which must now be fully developed for her sake, as a\r\nnecessary and natural channel of communication so desirable to her,\r\nwhich she should prize very highly. Also as a source of comfort for\r\nmyself and my father, especially as a joyful surprise for him when he\r\ncame home. Therefore it was decided between us that I was to sit one\r\nhour each day with Mrs. Bainbridge for development. My mother seemed to\r\nfeel sure that I would make an excellent trumpet medium, and encouraged\r\nme by predicting my speedy development as such. Strangely enough, so it\r\nproved. My progress was rapid. In two weeks time my mother could speak\r\nto me through the trumpet without difficulty and much to my delight. I\r\nbegan to appreciate the great value of my wonderful gift and to\r\nunderstand what it meant. Our dear family circle, which in my despair I\r\nhad thought broken forever, was now reunited. Father, mother, daughter!\r\njust us three as of yore. And--the wonder of it--I, the youngest, the\r\nweakest and the least wise of the trio, was the instrument! When I\r\nthought of the possibilities, of the joy and consolation it would bring\r\nto my father and mother, my heart swelled with gratitude and\r\nthankfulness that this mighty power had come to me. The power to destroy\r\nthe dread of death; to demonstrate the continuity of life; to prove that\r\nthe binding love of family ties, kindred, and cherished friends still\r\nshone with untarnished lustre beyond the shadows of the silent grave.\r\nHow beautiful, how wonderful, how glorious it was! And with this power\r\ncame the solemn charge that I was to cherish it with care and keep it\r\npure and holy. Yes, I resolved that I would do this conscientiously. It\r\nshould be my highest ambition to ever use my mediumship with my best and\r\nmost unselfish aspirations, to keep it apart from the grosser things of\r\nlife, to dedicate it to good and to good alone. And thus it was that my\r\nmediumship continued to develop and grow in perfection. My mother could\r\ntalk with me as often as she wished and as long at each sitting as she\r\ndesired. I was no longer alone or despondent, my darling mother still\r\ncould be, and was really, my mentor, friend, parent, teacher and\r\nspiritual guide. I forgot to mourn or to feel lonely, though I longed\r\nfor my father's homecoming that we might share this new found joy. So\r\ninterested was I and so occupied, that the two months quickly passed and\r\nmy dear father reached his home in safety. I had arranged for a quiet\r\nevening with him alone. When my mother, through the trumpet, joined in\r\nthe conversation and welcomed him with loving words of endearment, so\r\nfamiliar in the greetings of other days, he was almost overcome by the\r\nflood of ecstatic emotions that moved and thrilled him as he began to\r\nappreciate the significance of such a miraculous surprise. His heart was\r\nglowing and his entire being permeated with this great wave of\r\nhappiness. His face was radiant with joy and beamed with fatherly\r\naffection and pride as he pressed me to his heart again and again,\r\nthanking me for my thoughtful spiritual work in the development of my\r\nwonderful gift, which, for his consolation, I had striven so\r\nunselfishly, so ardently and so earnestly to attain, while facing alone\r\nthe one great crisis of my young life. Still holding me in his arms, he\r\nlooked into my eyes long and fondly, almost adoringly, as he said: 'With\r\nsuch a daughter, whose loving heart and purity of soul has won for her\r\nthe marvellous power to reunite our broken family circle, I am indeed\r\nthe most fortunate of all men.' Then in a moment I perceived that I was\r\nno longer a child, I was a woman; that henceforth my father would think\r\nof me as a woman--still his loving daughter--but also his equal, his\r\nconfidant, his trusted friend, his adviser in times of need, his oracle,\r\nhis medium of communication with the loved ones who dwelt in the world\r\nof spirit. How good and beautiful was life in the light of this new\r\nvista of possibilities and responsibilities for me! For the moment I\r\nseemed to be transported to some grand spiritual height, where as a\r\nresponsive spiritual unit, I felt the throbbing of the limitless sea of\r\nenvironmental life surrounding me like a golden mist, on every hand.\r\nEvery pulsation proclaimed my immortality as a part of that boundless\r\nsea; boundless, fathomless, unthinkably shoreless! of life,\r\nall-producing, all-containing! My soul no longer questioned. It was\r\nfilled with a peace and joy that passeth the power of words to describe.\r\n\r\n\"Thus inspired and encouraged for the future, I was ready and eager to\r\ntake up again the active duties of life. In resuming my collegiate\r\nstudies, it was agreed between my father and mother and myself, that I\r\nshould come home from Vassar every Friday evening, returning by the\r\nearly train Monday morning, the intervening time to be sacredly devoted\r\nto our trumpet family circles. Oh, Mr. Flagg! How happy we were then!\r\nFor the next three years nothing was allowed to interfere with these\r\ndelightful reunions, whose memories are associated with so many\r\nincidents that bound us three so closely with the silver cords of pure\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\"After leaving college, I accompanied my father in all of his\r\njourneyings after new data in economics and agriculture. For this\r\npurpose we spent the winter of 1902-3, travelling in France, Italy,\r\nGermany and England, returning to America in April, 1903.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE MARTINA MINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Early in June of the same year, Dewitt C. Dunbar discovered a new lead\r\nin the Martina mine which proved to be of such marvelous size and\r\nrichness, that my father's personal inspection was demanded at the\r\nearliest possible moment, to decide on the best methods of pushing\r\nforward the new work, and also to determine what part of the old work\r\nshould be continued. The numerous letters and telegrams from Mr. Dunbar,\r\nall urging the utmost haste on my father's part, gave him but little\r\ntime to consider the results of such a long journey, or to make the\r\nproper preparations for it. It was evident that Mr. Dunbar must be in a\r\nstate of intense excitement. In order to catch the next steamer from San\r\nFrancisco, father left a number of important items of business for me to\r\ntransact. I wished very much to go with him but all the circumstances\r\nseemed to conspire against me. Father promised to return at the earliest\r\npossible moment, meanwhile he was to send me a dispatch announcing his\r\nsafe arrival in Alaska. By the end of July, messages, and later, letters\r\nbegan to reach me announcing the wonderful output of gold from the new\r\nlead. So rich was the ore that for a time it was thought best to abandon\r\nall work in the old mine. I could see very plainly from his letters that\r\nthe fever of Mr. Dunbar's excitement and enthusiasm had also claimed my\r\nfather as a victim. I then foresaw that his stay in Alaska would be\r\nprolonged far beyond my expectations or his own. I began to feel very\r\nuneasy and to wish most fervently that I had insisted on going with him.\r\nI resolved in future to keep him company wherever he journeyed.\r\nMeanwhile the yield of gold from the new lead continued to increase. The\r\nvalue of the Martina rose like magic; offers to purchase at fabulous\r\nprices came pouring in. Mr. Dunbar would not accept, and decided, then\r\nand there, to remain another ten years as manager and resident\r\nsuperintendent of the mine. That settled the question. After that, my\r\nfather announced that the mine was not for sale at any price. In writing\r\nto me concerning the matter, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"'My Dear Fern: * * * I at that time decided that my interest in\r\n     the mine which I had named for your mother, and which had proven\r\n     the luckiest and richest in Alaska, should pass to you as it came\r\n     to me, entirely unencumbered. So rest assured, my daughter, so\r\n     long as Dewitt C. Dunbar is able and willing to manage the mine,\r\n     both my interests and yours are in safe hands; in skill, honesty\r\n     and ability he is one of the grandest men I have ever known; he is\r\n     a treasure. You can trust him implicitly!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As I had anticipated, it was December before my father could leave\r\nAlaska. In a letter dated Dec. 5, to which I shall again refer, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"'I have planned to leave here on a steamer that sails on the tenth\r\n     of this month. I fear the voyage may prove a rough one. I have a\r\n     foolish dread of it, which is quite unusual for me. I am oppressed\r\n     by an uneasy feeling which I strive in vain to shake off. However,\r\n     I have taken good care to make such arrangements with Mr. Dunbar as\r\n     will cover all possible contingencies. This is to be my last trip.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On the twelfth of December I received a message from Mr. Dunbar,\r\nstating that Fennimore Fenwick had sailed on the tenth as he had\r\nplanned; that he was well and strong, and would wire me as soon as he\r\nreached San Francisco. This cheering message gave me new courage, I\r\nbegan to count the days and to look forward more hopefully. I decided,\r\nalthough it was so late in the season, to wait here in the cottage until\r\nmy father came. When Mrs. Bainbridge left to open our house in\r\nWashington, I had intended to follow her a few days before Christmas,\r\nbut for some unexplained reason, I could not make up my mind to leave\r\nthe cottage. After the message came the question was settled--I was to\r\nremain here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSPIRIT AND MORTAL.--FATHER AND DAUGHTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At this point, Mr. Flagg, I wish you to carefully note the significance\r\nof the strange event which soon followed. Christmas Eve, 1903, found me\r\nhere alone, seated at my desk, alternately reading, musing and writing.\r\nAll day a terrific snow storm had been raging, at nightfall it continued\r\nwith increased severity. I could hear the fierce gale shriek as it\r\nlashed the tree tops furiously. I shuddered when I thought what danger\r\nsuch a gale might mean to the good steamer, bearing my father homeward\r\nbound across the rough, icy waters of that far off wintry sea; that\r\nyawning, terrible, treacherous sea!\r\n\r\n\"During the afternoon I had been nervous and lonely. As a solace, I had\r\na long talk from my mother through the trumpet, which cheered and\r\ncomforted me greatly, especially her confident promise that I should\r\nhear from papa even sooner than I had hoped. Over this I was musing when\r\na strange thing happened. I was startled by the low tones of a familiar\r\nvoice from the trumpet. Almost frozen with fear, I heard: 'Do not be\r\nfrightened, my darling; I am your father, Fennimore Fenwick, who loves\r\nyou, if possible, more than ever. A frightful storm wrecked the steamer\r\nand released me from my body. Nearly all of the passengers and crew\r\nperished with me. A few still survive; they are in a single open boat,\r\ntossing helplessly in the awful surge of that wild waste of water,\r\npossibly they may yet be saved. My dear wife, Martina, your own\r\nbeautiful mother, was watching and waiting for me at the scene of the\r\nwreck. Hers the beautiful arms that welcomed me as I was born into the\r\nnew life of the spirit. How glorious it was that she, so dear to me,\r\ncould be there. In the radiance and splendor of all her spiritual\r\nloveliness, I was charmed almost to the point of forgetfulness. I seemed\r\nto be floating on the bosom of a sea of golden mist, my spirit filled\r\nwith a measureless contentment. Presently I awoke to a vivid\r\nconsciousness of my new life. In the light of the loving eyes of my\r\npeerless Martina, I was soon made to realize that I had just passed\r\npainlessly from life mortal to life spiritual. I perceived that time and\r\nspace no longer barred the flight of my freed spirit. Hand in hand we\r\ncame; almost before I knew it we were here. Thanks to your mediumship,\r\nand to this trumpet, I could come and speak to you so soon. Yes, my dear\r\nchild, we three, a loving trio, are still united just as of yore. I\r\nshall be permitted to help you, from this side of life, to carry out and\r\ncomplete my plans and purposes regarding improved modes of farm life. I\r\nwrote you from Alaska on the fifth of this month, announcing my\r\nintention of sailing on the tenth; that letter came by a Victoria\r\nsteamer and will soon reach you. At that time I was weighed down by a\r\npremonition of some impending disaster. So seriously was I impressed,\r\nthat I at once made arrangements with Dewitt C. Dunbar, in case of my\r\ndeath, to continue to operate the mine in partnership with you on the\r\nterms now in force, and this he was perfectly willing to do. By the\r\nterms of my will, now in the hands of my attorneys at Washington, you\r\nare at this moment, sole heir to my large fortune. As you know, I long\r\nago placed my brothers and sisters beyond the reach of want. Well do I\r\nknow, my dear girl, that I can trust you perfectly, to carry forward my\r\nwork.'\r\n\r\n\"As his voice ceased to vibrate in the trumpet, I sprang to my feet\r\nwith outstretched and imploring hands: 'Father!' I cried, 'How can I do\r\nthis work alone? I am yet but a child, with a very limited business\r\nexperience to fit me for this great responsibility.' He at once replied:\r\n'Fear not, my child. Faithful, capable, and trustworthy help shall be\r\nbrought to you. At all times I shall be near, to advise, and to guard\r\nyou and your interests. Go forward bravely in the conscious power of\r\nyour own potential spirit, dominant and dauntless. Armed with the\r\nmajesty and mystery of your mediumship, all obstacles shall yield, and\r\nnaught shall prevail over you!' This prophetic command, so thrilling, so\r\nimperative, touched and stirred my inner self; my soul responded to the\r\nappeal. In one brief moment I regained my self control; was calm, could\r\nthink clearly and reason logically.\r\n\r\n\"At intervals throughout the night I continued to consult with my\r\nparents. My father advised me to write at once, announcing his death,\r\nand requesting Mr. Dunbar to fix a time at which he could meet me in San\r\nFrancisco, for a conference. This I did at the earliest practicable\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point in her story, Fern Fenwick said: \"Mr. Flagg, I now realize\r\nthe wonderful prescience of my father's promise of abundant and timely\r\nhelp, especially when I consider your life work, and the masterly way\r\nyou have equipped yourself for it, and finally, by the mysterious manner\r\nin which we were brought together. Is it not almost like a miracle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Miss Fenwick, I am lost in amazement! It seems to me that I\r\nmust be dreaming! The situation is so entirely outside of my experience,\r\nso unthinkably strange to me, that I doubt my ability to discuss it\r\nintelligently. Your story is the most marvelous of anything I have ever\r\nheard. I feel quite sure that it must be strictly true, yet I can\r\nscarcely comprehend it. A host of questions arise in my mind, which I\r\nwish to ask, if I may be permitted. When you heard the voice from the\r\ntrumpet, how could you feel so sure it was your father speaking? That he\r\nhad been swallowed up by the sea? That the shipwreck had really\r\noccurred?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wonder at your questions, Mr. Flagg,\" said Fern Fenwick, \"I\r\nwill gladly answer as best I can. Without considering or discussing the\r\nfact that the crucial test of identity was disclosed by almost every\r\nword which my father uttered, yet I could not for a moment doubt his\r\npresence. I knew he was there. I recognized every intonation of the\r\nvoice. I felt the identity of his spiritual personality, radiant with\r\nthe silent force of his love for me, quite as plainly as though at that\r\nmoment his physical personality had entered the room. My experience\r\nafter my mother's transition, the development of my mediumship, and my\r\nincreased sensitiveness to the presence of spiritual entities, no doubt\r\naided me greatly. At that time I perceived and recognized without\r\nquestion, that life in the physical is but the expression of the spirit,\r\nor Ego; that after the passing of the physical, the Ego inherits and\r\npossesses immortality as a conscious individual entity, clothed with a\r\nspiritual body, perfectly fitted for its continued existence in the\r\nrealms of the world of spirit; that, through the action of a natural\r\nlaw, the law of mediumship, such spirits can and do, come to and\r\ncommunicate with their friends and loved ones in earth life. All these\r\nthings, I knew my father understood clearly, therefore I was prepared to\r\naccept the verity of his spiritual presence as readily as I would any\r\nother phenomenon of nature. In conclusion, I may as well tell you at\r\nthis point, that the letter referred to by father as having been written\r\nby him in Alaska on December fifth, together with my conference in San\r\nFrancisco, some months later, with Dewitt C. Dunbar; the arrival in port\r\nat that time of a China steamer, bringing the mate and four sailors as\r\nsole survivors from the wreck of the ill-fated steamer, and my interview\r\nwith them, all confirmed, in every particular, the truth of the\r\nstatements concerning the matter, which were made by my spirit father,\r\njust after his passage through the gateway of death from life mortal to\r\nlife spiritual. Can I add anything more convincing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Miss Fenwick! I believe what you have told me is absolutely\r\ntrue. I can perceive and appreciate its wonderful significance only in\r\npart. I understand now clearly why it was necessary for me to know so\r\nmuch of the story of your life and that of your noble father. I have\r\nlistened to your story with almost breathless interest, with all I am\r\nprofoundly impressed. A new world is opening to me. My mental and\r\nspiritual horizon has been extended beyond the power of words to\r\nexpress. Life has a thousand new meanings: In them I read the importance\r\nand responsibility of the great work we are about to undertake. I wait\r\nwith increased interest for my personal interview with your father. Now\r\nthat I have heard so much of him, I bow with added reverence to his\r\ngreat and noble love for humanity which prompted, and his wonderful\r\ngenius which conceived and planned the work so generously. I am proud\r\nand thankful that I have been chosen as an instrument deemed capable and\r\nworthy of helping to carry it forward.\r\n\r\n\"As to things spiritual, pertaining to a life beyond the grave, I am\r\nintensely interested and eager to know more. May I hope, Miss Fenwick,\r\nthat you will kindly consent to become my teacher in this new school of\r\nwonderful phenomena and spiritual law? I too, am alone in the world; my\r\nfather and mother have both passed the bitter flood of the dark river of\r\ndeath. They too, like your parents, must now be living in the world of\r\nspirit as conscious, loving father and mother, with hearts filled with a\r\nliving, glowing affection that can and will respond to my own. Can it be\r\npossible that I am to feel and know this by direct communication with\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be delighted, Mr. Flagg, to help you in this matter in any way\r\nthat I can. Your desire for a direct communication from your parents is\r\nperfectly natural and right and, I doubt not, will be fully gratified in\r\na few days.\r\n\r\n\"In this connection, let me ask: Have you ever had a seance with a\r\nmedium? Do you know anything about the laws that control and govern\r\nmediumship? Have you been interested to any extent in reading the\r\nall-comprehensive philosophy which mediumship demonstrates?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad, Miss Fenwick, that you have put those questions. I\r\ndesire to state briefly and frankly my attitude, up to this time,\r\ntowards mediumship and the philosophy and phenomena of spiritual\r\nmanifestations generally: I believe I was a born agnostic. All my life I\r\nhave been skeptical as to the verity of a life beyond the grave. In this\r\nI have differed widely from my people, a large majority of whom have\r\nbeen zealous Presbyterians for at least five generations, while I have\r\nfollowed Voltaire and Ingersoll. In the ranks of their following I have\r\nbeen content to cry: 'I don't know! I can wait! One world at a time is\r\nenough for me!' As to mediumship, or any manifestations of it, I know\r\nalmost nothing. The few mediums I have met accidentally, have\r\nunfortunately failed to impress me favorably. All that I have heard or\r\nread of them has had a strong tendency to prejudice me against them and\r\nthe philosophy they taught. Therefore, until my visit to this cottage, I\r\nhave never been at all interested in the matter. I now perceive that in\r\nstudying the great problem of life, and how best to learn most about it,\r\nI have utterly ignored one of the most important sources of both\r\ninformation and inspiration. My prejudice and indifference have\r\nvanished. I wonder at myself, at my readiness to accept your point of\r\nview regarding your most marvelous mediumship and its wonderful\r\nmanifestations; at my feverish interest and anxiety to learn all I can\r\nabout things spiritual at the earliest possible moment; at my intense\r\nlonging for the complete verification of all the beautiful propositions\r\nrelating to spiritual life which you have stated so eloquently and so\r\nconvincingly; but most of all do I wonder and am amazed that these\r\nthings are not miracles; that they occur through the action of natural\r\nlaw, which, if true, makes it possible--nay probable--that mediumship\r\nand its manifestations are as old as life itself. This, Miss Fenwick,\r\ndefines my position as clearly as I can state it. Do you think I am\r\nlikely to prove a pupil worthy of his teacher?\"\r\n\r\n\"I most assuredly do, Mr. Flagg,\" said Fern. \"I think you are now\r\nprepared for the promised interview with my father. However, before he\r\njoins us, I wish to say by way of explanation, that when I am here\r\nalone, he can use the trumpet with ease at any moment and in any kind of\r\nlight, but in the presence of strangers, different conditions are\r\nrequired. We shall at first be obliged to use another kind of light. By\r\nthe aid of this light you can plainly see the trumpet, supported\r\nhorizontally in the air just over his chair, but you will be unable to\r\ndiscern even the faintest outline of the spiritual form holding it; as\r\nin using the trumpet, the vital force of both the manifesting spirit and\r\nthe medium is concentrated in the trumpet in the effort of speaking. Sit\r\nperfectly quiet for a moment; I will close the windows and prepare the\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\nA few touches on the small keyboard in her desk, and lo the heavy double\r\ncurtains swiftly and silently unrolled and covered the windows. At the\r\nsame moment, the beautifully ornamented, dome shaped center of the lofty\r\nceiling began to glow with a constellation of soft, phosphorescent\r\nlights, filling the room with a radiance as mild and silvery as\r\nmoonlight, and yet even more soothing to the nerves. Presently the air\r\nwas vibrant with the low, sweet strains of distant music, soft and slow\r\nand of such exquisite harmony that it seemed a rare combination of all\r\nthat was inspiring, charming and beautiful in the variations of time,\r\nsound and rythm. The combined effect of the light and the music on\r\nFillmore Flagg was electrical. Every nerve was thrilled with rapture.\r\nHe was completely absorbed. As the music ceased he turned with a start\r\nto look for the trumpet. As he looked, it slowly rose from the chair and\r\nthere came from it the clear tones of a manly voice, full of sweetness\r\nand power. He heard these words: \"Fern, my daughter, will you tell this\r\ngentleman who I am?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear father,\" said Fern, \"How glad I am that you have joined us! Mr.\r\nFlagg, this is my father, Fennimore Fenwick, of whom I have told you so\r\nmuch. Father, this is Mr. Fillmore Flagg, who, as you already know, has\r\npromised to devote himself to our work.\"\r\n\r\nAs the trumpet slowly moved nearer, Mr. Fenwick said: \"Mr. Flagg, as the\r\nfather of Fern Fenwick, I extend to you a cordial greeting and a most\r\nhearty welcome to Fairy Fern Cottage. I trust this is but the\r\ncommencement of a long and uninterrupted acquaintance, which may soon\r\nripen into a true friendship, that shall bring much pleasure and profit\r\nto both. I am exceedingly well pleased with your advanced ideas on the\r\nsubject of co-operative farming as the proper cure for the evils that\r\nnow make farm life so miserable and so unsatisfactory. I wish\r\nparticularly to congratulate you on the thoroughly systematic and\r\nsuccessful methods you have adopted to it yourself so well for this\r\npeculiar work.\r\n\r\n\"Now my young friend, one moment to another matter which is likely to\r\nprove of great interest to you. I find your parents in spirit life. I\r\nmet them since you came to the cottage. They approve of your chosen life\r\nwork. They are very proud of you, their beloved son and only child. They\r\nbid me give you a message of love with the assurance that they will\r\nspeak to you through this trumpet very soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fenwick,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"I thank you for the encouragement\r\nof your kindly greeting and for the many pleasant things you have said\r\nof me and my work. In the future I shall strive conscientiously to merit\r\nyour praise, and hope to earn your lasting friendship. As to the glad\r\ntidings from my parents in spirit life, I am rejoiced. In my heart the\r\ntorch of hope is lighted; its pure flame is fast burning away the\r\nbarriers of the belief I have so long entertained, that 'Death ends\r\nall,' also of the equally depressing creed of my Presbyterian people,\r\nwho have so long taught and thought that 'The dead know not anything;'\r\nthat my parents, with that vast army of souls, having passed the portals\r\nof the tomb, are now lost in the oblivion of that long unconscious,\r\ndreamless slumber, which stretches from the new made grave to The Day of\r\nJudgment. Hence, the message of love from my parents, with the assurance\r\nthat they will speak to me so soon, has made me very happy. I am content\r\nto wait patiently for such further messages as opportunity may bring to\r\nme. I am ready and eager, Mr. Fenwick, to hear your plans. Please\r\nproceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Fennimore Fenwick. \"Fern, my daughter, you are to\r\nremain at your desk with pencil and note book, prepared to take down\r\nwhat I have to say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE ETHICS OF PLANETARY EVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In order to plan this work wisely, and to discuss it understandingly,\r\nit will be necessary at the beginning to go back to first principles, to\r\ntry to discover the real object and purpose of human life on this\r\nplanet. In searching along the pathway of countless ages in our planet's\r\nhistory, we discover a continuous upward movement in the progression of\r\nthe manifestations of life; from the mineral to the vegetable; from the\r\nvegetable to the animal; from the animal to man. Man representing the\r\napex of progress in the constantly ascending spiral of the evolution of\r\nlife from the birth of the planet to the present time. Therefore, both\r\nspirit and mortal, we are all children of the planet, chained to its\r\ndestiny, all alike working factors in the achievement of its purpose so\r\nmighty. Through the planet, its solar system, and the system of systems\r\nin a long line of an infinite series, far beyond the power of\r\ncomputation, we are also the children of the Great Oversoul, the Source\r\nand Center of all life!\r\n\r\n\"Human life, then, is the flower and fruit of the planet--the highest\r\ncombined expression of its life--each life a planetary seed, a\r\nconcentrated possibility of all expressions of planet life. Perhaps the\r\nmost convincing and beautiful illustration of the truth of this vital\r\nand all important proposition is, that the reproductive cells of man in\r\nhis highest state of development, multiply by fission, or self-division\r\ninto halves, as did the primal sperm of protoplasm at the very beginning\r\nof vegetable and animal life. This great philogenetic vine with its\r\nmyriads of branching arms, reaches in an unbroken line from the lowest\r\nto the highest forms of life; all alike are fruit of this vine. This\r\noffers indisputable evidence of the common brotherhood of humanity! the\r\nmotherhood of the planet! the fatherhood of the Great Oversoul!\r\n\r\n\"From these premises we may safely conclude that the object and purpose\r\nof this planet is the evolution of human beings, their continued growth\r\nand development, until the state of perfection for the entire race is\r\nreached. With this comes the complete achievement of the purpose of the\r\nexistence of the planet. Hence, we perceive that human life is the most\r\nprecious production of the planet. Henceforth its energies are to flow\r\ntowards the perfecting of the human race.\r\n\r\n\"In the great, white light of a higher understanding of these basic and\r\nvital truths, let us strive to make conditions for the protection of ALL\r\nhuman life. The task becomes less difficult as we more readily\r\ncomprehend and appreciate the magnitude of the thought, that through the\r\nplanet, this sacred life is the immortal and enduring expression of the\r\nEternal Spirit. Viewed in this light, we apprehend clearly that all\r\nacts, by society or individuals, which tend to protect, promote and\r\npurify this life, are good, right and holy, and in their doing, become\r\nthe highest and best expression of a sacred religious duty. On the\r\ncontrary, all acts of society or individuals, which tend to destroy,\r\ninjure, poison or sully this sacred life, or to bar its ordained\r\nprogress are, in themselves, unholy, wrong, criminal and cruel, and in\r\ncommission, become the greatest and most unpardonable of all sins.\r\n\r\n\"All this becomes more apparent, when we consider that the sum of the\r\npleasant sensations of the individual, and the happifying emotions which\r\nflow from them, constitutes the sum of human happiness. All conditions\r\nof life which promote right living, ethical culture and moral growth,\r\nnourish and call forth emotions of truth and honesty, pure pleasure,\r\nadoration, worship, hope, affection, love and all the higher and nobler\r\ncharacteristics, build up life and increase its capacity for happiness.\r\nThrough the action of an equally inexorable and unswerving law, the\r\nmisery and crime which poverty breeds, with its bitterness of hate,\r\ngrief and despair, and all the train of other evil emotions engendered\r\nthereby, are poisonous in their nature; they tear down and destroy life.\r\nTherefore that social and industrial system which affords most\r\nabundantly, and for all of the people, conditions that are\r\nlife-promoting and poverty-banishing, is logically the nearest just and\r\nright, because it is the nearest in harmony with natural law, and the\r\nobject and purpose of human life.\r\n\r\n\"Society as a whole, like a chain with defective links, is no stronger\r\nsocially, morally, industrially, or politically, than its weakest unit.\r\nHence it becomes the self interest of every individual member to\r\nendeavor unselfishly to build up and strengthen the weaker units in\r\nevery possible way.\r\n\r\n\"These propositions furnish the only sound basis for a perfect system of\r\npolitical economy--a system which shall afford the greatest amount of\r\ngood or happiness to all the people. In considering the clearness and\r\nstartling significance of these truths, we discover the cruel, criminal\r\nwrong of any system of competition, based on the old barbaric law of the\r\nsurvival of the fittest, which in its application means the pleasure and\r\nhappiness of the few at the expense of the toil, pain and misery of the\r\nmany. In this connection we note that man, in his evolutionary progress,\r\nhas reached a point where, being mentally and spiritually awakened to a\r\nknowledge of the higher purposes of life, he perceives the true effect\r\nof environmental conditions, with their good and evil tendencies. He\r\nalso perceives the cause and the cure. Armed with the talisman of this\r\nknowledge, he boldly enters the field of causation and thenceforward\r\nbecomes a self-directing factor in his own evolution. At this important\r\nstage, he clearly comprehends, that the injury of one is the concern of\r\nall; that the perfection of all becomes the highest interest of each;\r\nthat the unprogressive law of the survival of the fittest, is nullified\r\nand replaced by the higher law of unselfishness of the individual for\r\nthe advancement of the race; that the dual nature of man, physical and\r\nspiritual, must be considered as inseparable, when dealing with the\r\npractical questions of life; that physical life, as the primary school\r\nof existence, is ephemeral, while the spiritual is the permanent and\r\nenduring; that, consequently, the path of progress for the human soul,\r\nlies almost entirely in the realms of the spiritual; that a life on the\r\nphysical plane, devoted solely to selfishness, dwarfs and chokes the\r\nspiritual nature, and becomes a serious bar to unfoldment and progress\r\non the spiritual plane of existence: Finally, that, like the pent up\r\nenergies of some mighty volcano, the irresistible upward thrust of\r\nnature's unfoldment, ever producing and disclosing higher expressions of\r\nlife, is to find its present outlet through these channels, by the wise\r\nuse of methods in harmony with the principles stated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE CO-OPERATIVE FARM AS A FACTOR IN SOCIAL EVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From the thorough understanding and appreciation of these principles,\r\nby the workers on your model co-operative farm, must come the necessary\r\nzeal, the cementing enthusiasm of a mighty purpose which, with ever\r\nincreasing volume, shall urge them forward to the goal of complete\r\nsuccess. As one of the means to insure this success, we must strive to\r\nintroduce a new era for agriculture, in which co-operative working shall\r\nbe supplemented and reinforced by co-operative thinking. As applied to\r\nfarm work, this is a new and untried field which promises grand results.\r\n\r\n\"In all kinds of productive labor, muscular effort is a mental\r\ndemonstration! The keener the mentality controlling the muscles, the\r\nmore satisfactory the work accomplished. The more interested and the\r\nhealthier and happier the laborer is in his work, the easier it becomes\r\nfor him to produce superior results. For centuries, farm work has been\r\nconsidered the natural avocation of the ignorant and the illiterate!\r\nStrange as it may appear, it seems to have been generally conceded that\r\nthe typical clodhopper was the ordained farmer! That this perverted idea\r\nregarding the requirements of a tiller of the soil, should have\r\nmaintained its existence for so many ages, is a matter of profound\r\nastonishment to every intelligent thinker!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Mr. Fenwick,\" said Fillmore Flagg, \"if at this time I quote\r\na case in point from my own state. As late as the year 1897, a Bishop\r\nWithington, of Nebraska, speaking of farmers' sons who were struggling\r\nfor an education, says of them:\r\n\r\n\"'The farmers' sons--a great many of them--who have absolutely no\r\nability to rise, get a taste of education and follow it up. They will\r\nnever amount to anything--that is, many of them--and they become\r\ndissatisfied to follow in the walk of life that God intended they\r\nshould, and drift into cities. It is the over-education of those who are\r\nnot qualified to receive it that fills our cities, while the farms lie\r\nidle.'\r\n\r\n\"This, Mr. Fenwick, is but a sample of many like expressions from the\r\nlips of public men, showing the stigma and low estimate which is placed\r\non farmers as a class, by clerical, professional and commercial people.\r\nWhen we consider that farming people form a large majority of the\r\ncitizens of our republic, a republic whose constitution guarantees equal\r\nrights for all; whose chief corner stone from the beginning, has been\r\nits admirable system of free education in its public schools; the\r\nmanifest endeavor of the Bishop and his class, to consign the tillers of\r\nthe soil to a caste of low order, and to argue that education is for the\r\nfew and not for the farmer, indicates something radically wrong in our\r\nsocial system that augurs ill for the future of our republic. That the\r\ndissatisfaction is widespread and serious, is manifest to all thinkers\r\nand observers. To discover the cause and cure, and to speedily apply the\r\nremedy for this growing discontent, becomes an imperative duty for all\r\npatriotic people. In my experience, the following are some of the most\r\nprolific causes:\r\n\r\n\"The isolation and loneliness of the small farm.\r\n\r\n\"The long hours of tedious, monotonous toil for both man and woman.\r\n\r\n\"The constantly increasing competition of large farms, armed with\r\ncapital and expensive machinery, which tends to reduce the price of farm\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\"The want of proper society, healthful amusements, books, and many other\r\nnecessary educational facilities.\r\n\r\n\"The discouraging meagerness of the financial returns for a year of such\r\nconstant toil.\r\n\r\n\"These things all tend to destroy the farmer's love for, and pride in,\r\nhis occupation, until farm work becomes a repulsive drudgery, and he\r\nflies to the city for a more congenial employment. Is it then, under the\r\ncircumstances, any wonder that the farmers' sons should become\r\ndissatisfied with the occupation of their birth? That in company with\r\ntheir sisters and sweethearts they should be determined, at all hazards,\r\nto escape from the evils of what Bishop Withington terms a\r\n'God-ordained' class of hewers of wood, drawers of water, and tillers of\r\nthe soil, a class which dooms them and their children to a future of\r\nhopeless toil?\r\n\r\n\"Agriculture forms the basis and support of our national, industrial and\r\ncommercial success. Therefore it is imperative that agricultural\r\npursuits be made to become the most noble and pleasing of all\r\noccupations. How can this be accomplished?\r\n\r\n\"Surely, co-operative farming, with its improved conditions and methods,\r\nis the remedy indicated!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Flagg,\" said Fennimore Fenwick, \"Co-operative farming is the\r\npartial remedy which shall start the healing process, and lead to the\r\ndiscovery of a perfect cure. You have ably stated the evils which make\r\nliving on small farms so unsatisfactory. You have also made an excellent\r\nargument for our work from the text Bishop Withington has so blindly\r\nand unthinkingly furnished. It is quite evident that neither he nor his\r\nclass, have the least conception of the true cause of the discontent\r\nthey so deeply deplore. It is also equally clear that with all the\r\nadvantages of superior conditions, with the observation and education of\r\na lifetime, they have so far, utterly failed to understand or appreciate\r\nthe real object and purpose of human life. They are sorely in need of an\r\nobject lesson which we must furnish.\r\n\r\n\"In efforts to slake a natural thirst for knowledge, the brightest\r\nminds, the most profound thinkers of the past ten centuries, at the end\r\nof lives devoted to study, have declared that the vast domain of\r\nknowledge still remained practically an unexplored field. This domain is\r\nfor coming generations to conquer and possess. It invites the efforts of\r\nmillions of co-operative thinkers, born and trained for the task. Hence,\r\nto me, it is as clear as the noonday sun that the embodiment of more\r\nmind by our agricultural people, is a matter of imperative necessity.\r\nThey should have the leisure and the opportunity to become familiar with\r\nall the varied phenomena of nature, through the recorded observations\r\nthat comprise the different sciences, which describe and explain all\r\nphases of surrounding life. Thus equipped, they will be able to discover\r\nthat they are a living, working, part of nature, which defined, means\r\nthe combined life of the planet; that they act upon all things about\r\nthem and are in turn acted upon. A comprehension of these things can\r\ncome only to the cultivated mind, and the richer its store of facts, the\r\nmore perfect its grasp and control of surrounding conditions. Therefore\r\nmind, as the expression of the soul and body of the dual individual on\r\nthe physical plane of existence, is EVERYTHING! It controls and molds\r\nstructure; the body; the people around. All history is but a detailed\r\ndescription of the action of mind.\r\n\r\n\"The great minds are the dominant thinkers; they sway the multitude,\r\nmold public opinion, effect legislation and shape the nation. These\r\ndominant minds should come from the people of the soil, as best equipped\r\nto discover and proclaim the law of the planet's unfoldment, also best\r\nable to conceive and formulate the wise laws which should guide and\r\ngovern its people. Hence the necessity for our farmers to become\r\nthinkers--dominant thinkers.\r\n\r\n\"What are the best conditions for mind unfoldment?\r\n\r\n\"As Professor Elmer Gates so wisely says, 'The human body is composed of\r\nmyriads of living organisms--a co-operative colony of more or less\r\nintelligent cells--which respond to the control of the individual Ego\r\nthrough the action of the mind, and to the electrical conditions which\r\nflow from the emotions.' Hence the body is an important part of the\r\nthinking machine and, therefore, a perfect mind must absolutely be the\r\nhighest expression of a perfect body. The perfect body needs to be well\r\nborn. To be well born, is to demand conditions for a perfect motherhood,\r\nand the perfect unfoldment of both mother and child together.\r\n\r\n\"Where can these conditions be found?\r\n\r\n\"We find them best and most abundant in the rural districts, far from\r\nthe turmoil and strife, the smoke and poisonous gases of the great city.\r\nSurrounded by fields and forests, in the pure air of a broad expanse of\r\ncountry, domed with the blue sky, and flooded with golden sunlight, on\r\nthe soil of the farm, close to the fostering bosom of our planet\r\nmother, Earth. Therefore it must be the distinctive and well defined\r\npurpose of our co-operative farm to furnish and perfect these\r\nconditions, thus uniting in perfect harmony stirpiculture with\r\nagriculture, a union as poetical as it is practical. From these\r\nconditions must come a race of dominant thinkers, the exponents and\r\nchampions of the real objects and purposes of human life.\r\n\r\n\"With the coming of such a race, comes the beginning of the era of\r\nunselfishness, and the end of the present era of selfishness, the age of\r\ngold worship, where greed for gold blights and withers public and\r\nprivate conscience, dominates and corrupts all forms of society, and\r\nmakes conditions which breed monopolies, caste, tramps, paupers, armies\r\nof idle men, strikes, discontent, starvation and revolution!\r\n\r\n\"Verily, a perfect catalogue of the ways and means by which 'Man's\r\ninhumanity to man, makes countless millions mourn!' With the dawn of the\r\nunselfish era, comes the demonstration of how man's humanity to man can\r\nand will make countless millions rejoice!\r\n\r\n\"In selecting the people who are to be the active, working members of\r\nour co-operative farm, it is a matter of the utmost importance that they\r\nshould be chosen from a class of persons who are capable of thinking in\r\nharmony on religious and political questions, who are already in\r\nsympathy with progressive ideas and co-operative work, intelligently\r\nalive to its importance and to its advantages, capable of understanding\r\nand appreciating that it is not the sole purpose of the organization to\r\nmake money but also to accomplish a multitude of things besides:\r\n\r\n\"First and foremost, to ennoble the occupation of their birthright.\r\n\r\n\"To make farming the most charming and healthful and most desirable of\r\nall vocations.\r\n\r\n\"To make it so remunerative that a reserve fund can be accumulated,\r\nsufficiently large to enable its members to purchase the necessary land\r\nfor an ever increasing series of co-operative farms, for their children\r\nand their children's children for generations yet to come.\r\n\r\n\"To unite stirpiculture so closely with agriculture that a race of\r\nperfect children shall be the crowning glory of all the productions of\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\n\"To afford ideal conditions for motherhood and childhood, that all\r\nchildren may be proudly welcomed to a world of loving hearts; that they\r\nmay be well born, wisely and beautifully unfolded mentally, morally,\r\nspiritually and physically; that they may be skillfully taught how to\r\nwork, to think, to reason, and to comprehend and appreciate the true\r\npurposes of life, consequently their duties as true men and\r\nwomen--self-poised and noble, a law unto themselves--capable and fully\r\nprepared to enter the walks of life as worthy and honored citizens of an\r\nideal republic.\r\n\r\n\"That it is to be the province of the farm, by the co-operative thinking\r\nof its workers, to develop and increase the fertility and productiveness\r\nof the valleys and plains to such an extent that the hills and mountains\r\nmay be reclothed with beautiful forests of choice trees, of varieties\r\nmost valued for lumber and timber; also great orchards of the choicest\r\nvarieties of fruit and nut bearing trees, as a source of future pleasure\r\nand profit, at the same time preparing the way for a more complete\r\ncontrol of climatic conditions. By the process of shading and protecting\r\nthe slopes of both hill and mountain by these valuable forests, a\r\nmagical change for the better is effected. Everywhere a soft, spongy\r\ncarpet of fallen leaves, ever increasing in thickness, is spread out,\r\nmoistening and enriching the soil and conserving the waters of the\r\nincreased rainfall. A thousand living springs of pure, sparkling water\r\nmake glad the plains and valleys. The evils of flood, erosion and drouth\r\nare checked; the climate made more congenial; the value of both hill and\r\nmountain, as a source of wealth, increased a thousand fold.\r\n\r\n\"Aided by the organization of our co-operative association, which makes\r\nit possible to treat large tracts of land as a single farm, this great\r\nwork can be easily and surely accomplished by the earnest and united\r\nefforts of a people who, surrounded by conditions of comfort and plenty,\r\nare in a suitable mood to plant what their children and coming\r\ngenerations may enjoy.\r\n\r\n\"As an evidence of man's awakening consciousness of his power, by means\r\nof intelligent co-operation, to make conditions that shall protect him\r\nand his loved ones from the many calamities which have hitherto beset\r\nand overwhelmed human lives, we note the extraordinary work accomplished\r\nby the different classes of insurance companies, during the past fifty\r\nyears. These companies are in fact large bodies of people, incorporated\r\nand working co-operatively and systematically together to protect\r\nthemselves. The success which has followed their efforts in this\r\ndirection has, for the thinker, a marked significance, pregnant with\r\nsuggestions for the future. In the co-operative farm, organized and\r\ncarried forward on lines in harmony with the principles and purposes\r\nbefore stated, this system of insurance, in its simplest, least\r\nexpensive and most practical form, is to be carried to its fullest\r\nextent into all the departments of life. By its wise provisions for the\r\ncare and protection of the weaker units, it insures its members against\r\nloss of employment or wages; against sickness, injury or accident;\r\nagainst poverty, hunger and crime. It insures to all, for themselves and\r\ntheir children, the perpetual right to occupy and till the soil, and\r\nthus to secure by short hours of pleasant, attractive labor, the\r\ngenerous return which can be obtained only by the most perfect system of\r\nscientific, co-operative farming, armed with abundant capital. In\r\naddition, it insures to them all the advantages of birth, health,\r\neducation, society and amusement which money can buy for the wealthy:\r\nmore leisure, more opportunities for mental, social, ethical and\r\nscientific self-culture. It also insures to the world at large an object\r\nlesson which shall demonstrate that the way is open for the poorest farm\r\nlaborer to secure the same results by joining these progressive\r\nco-operative bodies.\r\n\r\n\"In looking forward to the effect upon society which these combined\r\nfarms may have, we must consider the numbers and strength of the\r\nopposing force which, on every hand, will rise up as a bar to progress.\r\nFor years, gold, that concentrated essence of selfishness, has been\r\nrecognized by its worshipers as the crowned king of society, whose\r\ncrimson banners have borne these suggestive mottoes: 'I am not my\r\nbrother's keeper! His injuries concern me not!' 'Every man for himself!'\r\n'It is well and good and right that the happiness of the few should be\r\nsecured at the expense of the misery of the many, for is it not written,\r\n\"The poor ye have always.\"?'\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately, the law of compensation limits and finally crushes the\r\nreign of selfishness, causing it to perish by its own efforts to live,\r\nwhich in time destroy the substance upon which it feeds. Hence we may\r\nlook hopefully to the future. With prophetic eyes we may behold the\r\nvictorious march of these farm units by companies, battalions,\r\nregiments, brigades and divisions, like a vast army of peace, silently\r\nspreading, absorbing and conquering the old selfish system, grandly\r\ndemonstrating the solidarity of human life, and the irresistible force\r\nof the combined efforts of thousands of bravely unselfish souls, working\r\nand thinking in unison, filled with enthusiasm kindled and inspired by\r\nthe magnitude and grandeur of the true purposes of life.\r\n\r\n\"Having thus broadly outlined the scope of the work, with its underlying\r\nprinciples, we may now give attention to the details of the plan for the\r\ninitial farm. In this I would advise that the enterprise be made to\r\nadapt itself, so far as possible, to the present commercial and\r\nindustrial conditions. That it be an incorporated stock company,\r\nlimited. That its corporate life be for the longest possible term of\r\nyears, with the right to renew. That it shall secure and control at\r\nleast five thousand acres of land, to more readily enable it to dominate\r\nthe township, as the lowest political unit of the republic; and also to\r\ngive room for the planting of suitable forests. That its capital stock\r\nbe limited to one thousand shares, to be divided equally among five\r\nhundred co-operators, composed of two hundred and fifty couples or\r\nfamilies. That at the end of five years the stock be issued to the\r\nsubscribers as paid up stock, by cash from the sinking fund, paid in for\r\nthat purpose. That the stock of a retiring member can be sold only to\r\nthe treasury of the company, the same to be re-issued to the succeeding\r\nmember. That in order to avoid friction with the outside commercial\r\nworld, the stockholders collectively shall sell to themselves\r\nindividually, at ruling market prices, whatever they may need, the\r\nprofits to go as a contribution from all to the insurance fund for the\r\naged. That the care of the sick and the injured, and the education of\r\nthe children, be classed and paid as a legitimate expense of the farm.\r\nThat the co-operators collectively, pay to themselves individually, a\r\nwage sufficiently generous to enable them to purchase what they may\r\ndesire in the way of furniture, food and clothing; allowing for a\r\nliberal percentage to be devoted to the sinking fund, to pay for the\r\nfarm, the stock, and also for the additional land that may be secured as\r\nfuture farms for the children. That all other details necessary for the\r\nsuccessful carrying out of these plans, be left for a satisfactory\r\nsolution, to the practical working and co-operative thinking of the\r\nmembers of the farm.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you, Mr. Flagg, as soon as may be convenient, to make a tour of\r\ninspection for the purpose of selecting and purchasing ten of the most\r\navailable sites for such farms that you can find. From the ten you shall\r\nchoose the one best adapted to the conditions required for the initial\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\n\"After occupation, at the end of five years, these lands are to be sold\r\nto the co-operators, at the purchase price, which, in any event, must\r\nnot exceed the sum of ten dollars per acre. Until the deeds are made to\r\nthe co-operators, these lands are to be in your custody as sole agent\r\nand director.\r\n\r\n\"In these matters my daughter, Fern, will aid you in every possible way.\r\nMany times you will find her advice valuable, therefore when needed,\r\ncommand it without hesitation. I have an abiding faith that her\r\ninspiration will benefit you in many ways in achieving success for the\r\nmodel farm; a matter in which I am greatly interested and to which, as\r\nboth mortal and spirit, I have for a number of years given close\r\nattention and much earnest thought. I now leave the matter to you and to\r\nFern for such thought and discussion as the occasion may demand. I shall\r\nbe glad at any time to answer questions concerning any particular point.\r\nGood night, Mr. Flagg; Good night my daughter.\"\r\n\r\nAs Fennimore Fenwick bade them good night, both Fillmore and Fern\r\nreturned the salutation, and Fern rose from her chair, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I think, Mr. Flagg, that until now I have never quite understood the\r\nbroad principles of real unselfishness. In the light of my father's\r\ncomprehensive statement of the true purpose of human life, they stand\r\nforth in bold relief, clear and strong. What a grand incentive they\r\noffer, to stir the zeal and enthusiasm of our co-operative workers! All\r\nlife is affected by them and discloses new meanings. All life seems more\r\nprecious, more sacred. Yet the task assigned to you, Mr. Flagg, is not\r\nan easy one: I foresee many difficulties, but you will overcome all of\r\nthem. The plan is so thoroughly in harmony with right and justice, so\r\nfraught with happiness for the masses, that it must succeed! I trust\r\nthat you feel encouraged to go forward hopefully with the work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to Fennimore Fenwick,\" replied Fillmore Flagg, \"I am armed\r\nagainst all obstacles by a new philosophy of life. Its possibilities, as\r\napplied I to practical work, are beyond computation! His masterly\r\nstatement of the true theory and purpose of human life, embodies the\r\ncrystallized wisdom of centuries. I am profoundly impressed with it.\r\nApplied to my chosen life work, it demands my best thought, my entire\r\ndevotion: to co-operative work as exemplified by our proposed model\r\nfarm, it means unqualified success!\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Miss Fenwick, you have been hard at work, writing rapidly\r\nfor a long time. You need rest. Let us then postpone further discussion\r\nuntil tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think that will be best,\" replied Fern, \"so good night, Mr.\r\nFlagg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Miss Fenwick.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nFILLMORE AND FERN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Fillmore Flagg, a never-to-be-forgotten week has passed since the\r\ninterview with Fennimore Fenwick, noted in our previous chapter. He is\r\nstill at Fairy Fern Cottage, busy with preparatory work for his coming\r\ntour. Momentous events, which have radically changed his life, have\r\nfollowed each other in quick succession. Hours have passed as moments\r\nfly, in absorbing interviews with his spirit father and mother. His\r\nstore of questions in relation to their experiences in spirit life, have\r\nall been answered: these answers have in turn suggested many more, until\r\nnow he is satisfied. For him, the two worlds have been united--the\r\ncontinuity of life beyond the grave has been established as a verity\r\npast contradiction. As conscious individuals and loving parents\r\nin the realms of spirit life, his father and mother are as real\r\nto him as mortals. With each succeeding interview this conviction\r\nhas grown, until, fully conscious of their loving sympathy and\r\nsupport, he begins to comprehend the connection between life and\r\nimmortality; the stupendous meaning of immortal life--of never-ending\r\nprogression--overshadows and dominates all other thoughts. In profound\r\nreverence he repeats to himself:\r\n\r\n\"How noble, how sacred, how wonderful is life! A few years, comparably\r\nbrief as moments, on the mortal plane of existence, to be followed by an\r\nendless Eternity, spent in gleaning wisdom and happiness from the rich\r\nfields of infinite progression. By the measure of immortality, who shall\r\nattempt to describe or limit the destiny of a human soul? As the epitome\r\nof the planet, the universe, and the universal cosmos, it must follow\r\nthat the human soul is the repository of infinite possibilities. This,\r\nthen, is the spiritual heritage of all. Sin and suffering, selfishness\r\nand greed, crime and vice in the transitory stage of the mortal, might\r\nstain and retard his spiritual growth, but they could never destroy the\r\nglorious possibilities of the final unfoldment.\"\r\n\r\nThis broad conception of the possibilities of human life, here and\r\nhereafter, came to Fillmore Flagg as a revelation of the most sacred and\r\nmarvelous character: in the light of such a revelation, the hideousness\r\nof selfishness stood revealed like a grim and warning monster. Now he\r\nsaw the path of duty plain before him. On the higher, broader plane of\r\nunselfishness, he must strive to develop new powers and new aspirations\r\nto aid him in making better conditions for a more perfect protection and\r\nunfoldment of human life. To satisfy his highest ideal, he must devote\r\nhimself to this work. The inspiration of the two worlds was upon him!\r\nHis love for Fern Fenwick, the personification of all that was noble\r\nand beautiful, urged him forward; intensified and developed his highest\r\naspirations for good; permeated, glorified and dominated his entire\r\nbeing. Love and life!--the former, the mystery and the crowning glory of\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nHours of self communion, alone in his room, had for Fillmore Flagg a\r\nhitherto unknown charm. The crowding memories of the happiest and by far\r\nthe the most important week of his life, with a tenacity like fever-born\r\nvisions, passed through and occupied his mind again and yet again. The\r\nbright image of Fern Fenwick was the central figure of each event, her\r\ngrace and beauty was its chief point of interest.\r\n\r\nAt her unrivaled cottage home he had been the honored guest to whom she\r\nhad paid her undivided attention. Thanks to her wonderful mediumship, he\r\nno longer felt himself an orphan--the gateway of death was also the\r\ngateway of life. His father and mother had been restored to him, joined\r\nagain to his life--his heritage of immortality assured! The truth had\r\nbeen made plain to him that the people of the two worlds were joined by\r\neverlasting ties of love and sympathy into the one great flood of\r\nhumanity, all human beings, all immortal spirits, incarnate, excarnate.\r\n\r\nAgain, to Fern's mediumship he owed his acquaintance with Fennimore\r\nFenwick, whom he had learned to know, to admire, to love and respect as\r\nthe highest type of a wise, great and noble man. How fortunate he was in\r\nhaving so many opportunities for learning from such a great master! He\r\nprophesied then and there, that the gratitude of coming generations was\r\nto bear witness to the power, wisdom and eloquence of Fennimore\r\nFenwick's teachings.\r\n\r\nHow the memory of all these things swelled the tide of love for Fern\r\nFenwick, in the heart of Fillmore Flagg. How bright and amiable, how\r\ngloriously beautiful she was. How kind and gracious she was to him, and\r\nwhat a delightful deference she paid to his opinions! Would he ever\r\nagain experience another week so full of unalloyed happiness? He had but\r\nto close his eyes--a radiant vision of Fern Fenwick was before him,\r\nthrilling his heart with hope, urging him forward to the goal of duty.\r\nWith a sigh he thought of the coming journey. For one blissful week, in\r\nthe light of her angelic eyes, in the radiance of her loveliness, in the\r\nsubtle charm of her magnetic presence, he had basked as in the sunshine\r\nof paradise: now the hour of parting was approaching, he must not allow\r\nhimself to be despondent, that would be unmanly; he must hope, wait, and\r\nwork. Surely his star of destiny augured well for his future. Doubt he\r\ncould not; doubt he would not! Yes, he would banish all thought of\r\nparting. He would think of the work, of its demands, of how Fern had\r\nhelped him to prepare for it. Oh how proud he was of the peerless girl\r\nthat had grown so dear to him! As he recalled the many hours they had\r\nspent together in discussing the plans of Fennimore Fenwick; as applied\r\nto the several stages of development of the model farm, how he had\r\nadmired and appreciated Fern's brilliant ideas, her pertinent\r\nsuggestions, her wonderful power to foresee administrative difficulties\r\nand to provide most efficiently against them. How well these\r\naccomplishments attested the high order of her intellectual training;\r\nhow perfectly they demonstrated the astuteness of her power of thought,\r\nwhen applied to practical subjects. With such mental and spiritual\r\nattributes, supplemented and intensified by the deep inspiration and the\r\nawe inspiring majesty of her mediumship, how immeasurably superior she\r\nappeared when compared with other women. What problem in life so knotty\r\nthat she could not solve? With the aid of such a matchless woman, how\r\ncould he fail in the work before him?\r\n\r\nTogether Fern and Fillmore had examined many maps for the purpose of\r\ndeciding on the particular states to be inspected during the coming\r\ntour. The great south-west seemed to offer the best field for choosing.\r\nThe Indian lands, just coming into market, were not to be ignored. They\r\nwere located in a climate that would promote the growth of a large\r\nvariety of crops, therefore were especially desirable. Much time was\r\nspent by them in going over these important questions very carefully.\r\nFennimore Fenwick, from time to time, had given his opinion on many\r\ndoubtful points. Now everything was settled. Tomorrow Fillmore Flagg was\r\nto start for the rich lands of the great west and south-west, with\r\ncareful instructions to keep Fern Fenwick informed, by frequent letters,\r\nof his progress and whereabouts. Whenever a particular plot of ground\r\nwas selected, Fern was to send him a certified check for its purchase.\r\nThis plan was to be followed until all of the desired plots had been\r\nsecured. The preparatory work on the model farm was then to be\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of his departure, Fillmore Flagg in reviewing these\r\narrangements, began to perceive that many days must pass before he could\r\nhope to see Fern Fenwick again. The intensity of his love for her urged\r\nan immediate declaration, that he might know his fate before commencing\r\nhis long journey; on the other hand, prudence counselled a more patient\r\nwaiting and wooing as the only safe and honorable course for him to\r\npursue, as to declare his love at this time would be, under all the\r\ncircumstances which had made him a guest at the cottage, taking an\r\nunfair advantage of the confidence and hospitality of his charming\r\nhostess, who had become so inexpressibly dear to him. Yes, he would take\r\nup the burden of his work, full of confidence in the wisdom and\r\nwatchfulness of his guiding star. Hope whispered in his heart: \"Fern's\r\ndestiny is so closely interwoven with thine own, that no fear of the\r\nfuture need disturb thee; in peace and contentment await thou the\r\nfulfillment of thy brightest hopes.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the heart of Fern Fenwick, the impression left by the\r\nevents of the week, were marked and apparent even to herself. A change\r\nin her regard for Fillmore Flagg was manifest. He was so capable, so\r\nloyal to her, and to her interests; and withal so intensely in love with\r\nher, that in turn her admiration for him grew apace--in fact she did not\r\nattempt to hold it in check. She adored an honest frankness as much as\r\nshe despised smooth deceit. She knew that Fillmore Flagg was the soul of\r\nhonor and that she could trust him under all circumstances, else her\r\nfather would not have chosen him to be her worthy and trusted assistant\r\nin the work. In manly beauty he was very near to her ideal; in nobleness\r\nof heart, intellectual development and training, he was her equal:\r\ntherefore it was but natural for her to bestow glances of encouragement\r\non a lover so attractive, so cultured, so unselfish and so ardent.\r\nPerhaps she had met her fate! However, before dismissing the subject,\r\nshe decided at the first opportunity to call the attention of her father\r\nand mother to the matter and ask their advice, which would govern her\r\ncourse in the future. She felt that whatever the advice might be, in any\r\nevent, it would not mar or blight her true happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSOLARIS FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne year from the time Fillmore Flagg left Fairy Fern Cottage on his\r\ntrip to the west, we find him at \"Solaris Farm,\" the title chosen for\r\nthe model or experimental co-operative farm. The location was nearly\r\nmidway, on one of the through lines of railway which connect St. Louis,\r\nthe great central city of the Mississippi valley, with the gulf and\r\ninland cities of the mammoth state of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe land was beautifully located, the soil was rich and easy to\r\ncultivate. The entire tract was well watered by a fine, clear, swift\r\nflowing stream. In extent, the farm comprised ten sections, laying\r\ncompactly together, and making in all, 6,400 acres of choice land. Nine\r\nof the sections formed a perfect square, each of the four sides being\r\nthree miles in length. The tenth section joined the west line of the\r\nsouth-west section in the square, which made the south line of the farm\r\nfour miles in length. The railroad passed through the farm near the\r\nnorth line of the southern tier of sections, touching on the way an\r\nideal site for the farm village. About four thousand acres of the land\r\nwas broad, rolling prairie, combined with a large proportion of\r\nunusually rich river bottom, both well adapted to the growth of a great\r\nvariety of crops. The remainder of the farm presented a rough, broken\r\nsurface, with a soil not so rich, sometimes quite poor and gravelly, but\r\nbeing protected by a great bend in the river, was well covered by a\r\nvaluable growth of timber. The surface of the roughest ground covered\r\nlarge deposits of lead, zinc, mica and several varieties of choice clay.\r\nNumerous bold bluffs contained fine quarries of excellent stone for\r\nbuilding purposes, also for an abundant supply of lime and cement. A\r\nnumber of the ridges offered unlimited quantities of gravel and sand.\r\nHere and there several rich veins of a very good quality of bituminous\r\ncoal cropped out.\r\n\r\nIn making his preliminary examination, the quick eye of Fillmore Flagg\r\nsoon discovered that this eighteen-hundred-acre tract, of what the\r\nowners considered their poorest lands, marred and disfigured by a tangle\r\nof undergrowth, a confusion of unsightly rocks, gullies and bluffs; was\r\nin reality a treasure, a vast store of choice material for coming needs.\r\nWhen the ten sections, including this broken tract, were offered for the\r\nlump sum of thirty two thousand dollars, Fillmore Flagg quickly closed\r\nthe bargain. He was confident that at last, after many weeks of patient\r\nsearching, a most desirable site for the initial farm had been secured,\r\nat the low average price of five dollars per acre. No wonder he was\r\nelated and proud of his achievement! The remaining lands of the township\r\nwere sparsely settled by about fifty families, generally occupying large\r\nranches.\r\n\r\nActing on Fern Fenwick's advice, as soon as the site of the model farm\r\nwas chosen, Fillmore Flagg prepared an advertisement for publication in\r\nthree of the leading spiritual papers, setting forth the purposes of\r\nthe organization, together with the requirements necessary for\r\nmembership. The applications which soon followed were so numerous that\r\nat the end of the first three months he had been able to complete a very\r\nchoice selection for the colony. Before the end of the next three\r\nmonths, he had placed them on the farm, prepared for active work.\r\n\r\nIn the accomplishment of this remarkable feat in so short a time, he had\r\nthe able assistance of his trusted friends, George and Gertrude Gerrish,\r\nwho were, from the beginning, most thoroughly in sympathy with him and\r\neager to join him in the work. Fillmore Flagg had known them from\r\nchildhood and had learned to appreciate them as progressive people of\r\nthe most pronounced type, who were honest, courageous, and gifted to a\r\nhigh degree with the power to win the love and confidence of all who\r\nknew them.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Gertrude Gerrish were born and reared on Nebraska farms, near\r\nthe home of Fillmore Flagg. George was thirty-five; Gertrude, younger by\r\nthree years. They had been married fifteen years and were noted as a\r\nhandsome couple, being large, tall, straight and finely formed, with\r\nstrong, even temperaments. Their only son, Gilbert, was a delicate lad,\r\nin his fourteenth year, handsome, spirituelle and intellectual to a\r\nremarkable degree. He was a real genius, passionately fond of books, art\r\nand music; already an accomplished player on both the piano and violin.\r\nYet withal, he was very reticent, sensitive and shy, on account of his\r\nsmall size and deformed body, the result of spinal trouble caused by a\r\nfall while an infant.\r\n\r\nThe Gerrish family, for the eight years previous, had resided in St.\r\nLouis, where George and Gertrude were employed as teachers. When\r\nFillmore Flagg made them a visit while on his way west from Newburgh, he\r\nwas both surprised and delighted to find them spiritualists.\r\n\r\nThey at once became interested in his mission, and his plans for the\r\nestablishment of a model co-operative farm. At his urgent request, they\r\npromised to move at once to the farm, whenever located, in order to be\r\nprepared to receive the colonists properly as soon as they should\r\ncommence to assemble. This promise Fillmore Flagg considered a most\r\nextraordinary piece of good fortune, and so it proved.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this wisely planned co-operative work, at the end of the\r\nfirst six months, a carefully selected, most efficient colony, of five\r\nhundred adults and one hundred and fifty children, had been assembled\r\nand organized; the business of the incorporation completed; the stock\r\nall taken; the officers chosen and a general plan of the work prepared.\r\n\r\nGeorge Gerrish was chosen as President of the Solaris Farm Company,\r\nFillmore Flagg was made trustee and general manager. The members of the\r\ncompany were young and strong, accustomed to farm labor, full of\r\nenthusiasm for pushing forward the work. They were all wide awake and\r\nprogressive, quick to perceive and appreciate the importance and\r\nadvantage of applying co-operative thought and co-operative work to\r\nsystematic farming on a large scale. They were thoroughly in earnest and\r\nequally determined to make the model farm a complete success. With such\r\nan army of vigorous, intelligent workers, it was easy to accomplish\r\nbefore the close of the first year, the magical changes which had been\r\neffected at the farm.\r\n\r\nThe land had all been surveyed, examined and tested; the farm carefully\r\nsubdivided and platted, with a view to keeping a complete record, which\r\nshould include a debit and credit account with each subdivision. The\r\nsize and boundaries of these tracts were determined with reference to\r\nthe capacity of the soil to best produce certain kinds or crops of\r\ngrains, grasses, vegetables, vines, berries, fruits or trees. The crests\r\nof ridges, and all rough, gravelly lands, were set apart for timber,\r\nfruit and vineyard culture; the separate areas to be devoted to these\r\nthree classes were carefully calculated, described and marked on the\r\nplat. The number of roads required to connect the various fields and\r\nsubdivisions with the village, were laid out and made passable by\r\nbuilding the necessary bridges.\r\n\r\nThe site selected for the village was quite near to the railroad, and\r\nlarge enough to give abundant space for future factories, shops, lawns\r\nand ornamental pleasure grounds. The whole was graded, well drained and\r\nartistically laid out around the four sides of a spacious central\r\nsquare. A large, well constructed freight and passenger station, of\r\nSolaris brick, was built and established at the most convenient point on\r\nthe railroad. In this building were the post office, express office and\r\ntelegraph office, all in excellent business form and perfect working\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of brick had been one of the first industries developed\r\nat the farm. An inexhaustable supply of most excellent clay had been\r\ndiscovered just at the edge of the village site, and speedily connected\r\nwith it by a short tramway. From this clay the product of Solaris brick\r\nproved in every way desirable. In form, color, size and design, they\r\nwere much superior to ordinary brick. With them, the builder could, in\r\none half the time, with less cement, construct walls that were thick,\r\nsolid and durable, yet presenting beautiful surfaces both inside and\r\noutside. These walls would remain for many years in perfect sanitary\r\ncondition, kept free from dampness by the dry air circulation, due to\r\nthe constructive design of the brick. The very fine appearance of the\r\nnew railroad station, so advertised the beauty and excellence of Solaris\r\nbrick, that orders from abroad soon came pouring in. To fill these\r\norders without delaying the work on the village buildings, it became\r\nnecessary to double the size of the brick-making plant; also to increase\r\nthe number of workers. The unexpected development of such a large and\r\nprofitable allied industry, at almost the first stage of the preparatory\r\nwork at the farm, so encouraged Fillmore Flagg and his co-workers, so\r\nstimulated and quickened the spirit of inventive genius, that thereafter\r\nthe efficiency and capacity of the machinery kept pace with the steadily\r\nincreasing demand for brick, that too without further adding to the\r\nworking force or to the size of the plant.\r\n\r\nA deeper excavation of the clay beds brought to light a much finer class\r\nof clays, which proved so excellent for the purposes of manufacturing\r\ngeneral pottery, terra cotta ware, drain tiles and sewer pipe, that in\r\nconnection with the brick works, a factory for making that kind of\r\nmaterial was at once put in operation. The tramway was extended a half\r\nmile further from the village to reach the newly-opened stone quarries\r\nand coal mines, passing on the way large deposits of sand and gravel. By\r\nmeans of the tramway, an abundant supply of all kinds of the necessary\r\nmaterials could be placed on the building site very quickly. The best of\r\nstone for the foundations, quantities of brick, lime, sand and cement\r\nwere at hand, waiting for the builder. All this made possible the swift\r\nconstruction of superior buildings, equipped with all of the modern\r\nimprovements, including artistic ornamentation.\r\n\r\nAs a result, before the expiration of the first six months after the\r\narrival of the co-operators, the following buildings had been completed\r\nand were ready for use: On the south side of the public square, fronting\r\nnorth; one large mill for grinding flour and feed; one extensive\r\nbuilding, large enough to be occupied as a saw mill and planing mill,\r\nmachine, carpenter, repair and blacksmith shop all combined. On the\r\nnorth side of the square, fronting south; one large three story and\r\nbasement block of apartment houses, sufficiently capacious to\r\naccommodate eight hundred people. The three upper stories were high\r\nenough to afford twelve-foot ceilings between the floors. The rooms were\r\nlarge, well lighted, well ventilated, and so arranged on each floor as\r\nto offer to every family a parlor, sitting room, dining room, two bed\r\nrooms, one bath room, and a kitchen. The basement of the entire block\r\nwas furnished and fitted to be used as a restaurant, with the necessary\r\ndining rooms, kitchens, furnace rooms, store rooms and cellars. The\r\nlight frame dwellings, located on one of the rear streets, which had\r\ngiven a temporary shelter to the people until the completion of the\r\napartment house, were now utilized as work rooms, seed rooms, assorting\r\nrooms, store rooms, and for dairy and apiary purposes. On the west side\r\nof the square, fronting east, just across the corner from the apartment\r\nhouse, the well-appointed hall of Education and Amusement was erected.\r\nIt was three stories high, seventy five feet wide, and one hundred and\r\nfifty feet long. The upper story was entirely devoted to the library,\r\nassembly and amusement hall, with its large stage, numerous offices and\r\nante rooms. The lower rooms were arranged to be used for the business\r\noffices of the farm, the spacious school rooms for its one hundred and\r\nfifty children, the printing office and editorial rooms of the press\r\nclub, and the eleven additional club rooms reserved for the use of the\r\nadults. On the same side of the square, fronting eastward and separated\r\nfrom the hall of amusement and education by one hundred feet of space,\r\nwas the Solaris company store; four stories high, two hundred feet wide,\r\ntwo hundred feet long, built around three sides of a beautifully\r\narranged rose and flower garden. The two lower stories were used to\r\ndisplay a large stock of general merchandise, while the upper stories\r\nwere occupied by the force engaged in the manufacture of general\r\nclothing, underwear, and in tailoring and dress making. All of these\r\nfine structures were built of Solaris brick, with cut stone foundations;\r\nthe ornamental brick used in the fronts were especially designed for the\r\npurpose and proved wonderfully effective. In every particular the\r\nbuildings were a credit to the company, being beautifully planned,\r\nskillfully constructed, and located with due regard for architectural\r\neffect. From the preparation of the stone, the making of the brick, lime\r\nand mortar, to the final completion of the buildings, including the\r\nmaking and laying of the sewer pipes, nineteen-twentieths of the total\r\ncost was represented by the labor of the co-operators. Of course they\r\nwere led and taught by a few skilled workmen, directed by Fillmore\r\nFlagg, who had prepared the plans. The remarkable success achieved,\r\nproved a good lesson in the economics of co-operation, of the utmost\r\nsignificance and value; a lesson which filled the hearts of the members\r\nof the company with pride and joy, riveted and clinched their devotion\r\nto the model farm and opened their eyes to the possibilities of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nHaving finished this first series of buildings for immediate use,\r\nattention was given to the matter of improving the appearance of the\r\npublic square. In the center of the broad, smooth green, stood the tall,\r\nstraight flag-pole; from its top floated the stars and stripes. Eastward\r\nfrom the foot of the flag-staff, and slightly raised above the grassy\r\nsurface of the smoothly shaven lawn, was spread a living flag in true\r\ncolors, red, white and blue. This flag was of magnificent proportions,\r\ntwenty-five feet in width by fifty feet in length, and presented such an\r\neffective appearance that it soon became the pride and delight of the\r\nfarm children, an object of never failing interest, a beautiful living\r\nmotto which expressed their appreciation of patriotism.\r\n\r\nWhile the building operations were being pushed forward, a carefully\r\nselected force of workers had been equally busy in making numerous\r\nagricultural improvements. Two thousand acres of virgin soil had been\r\nbroken up and prepared for planting. One hundred acres of the best of\r\nthis newly upturned soil, so clean and free from weeds, had been planted\r\nwith a well selected series of vegetables, capable of producing a\r\nremunerative crop of assorted garden seeds. The series included all of\r\nthe best known varieties with the addition of several new ones. As a\r\nresult of skillful culture and favorable conditions, a great many tons\r\nof choice seeds had been grown, gathered and prepared for market. Large\r\npropagating gardens had been fitted and seeded with reference to the\r\nfuture demands of fruit and forestry culture. An abundant supply of all\r\nkinds of vegetables for farm use had been grown and stored. Goodly crops\r\nof corn, oats and potatoes, grown and harvested. Plenty of hay cut,\r\ncured and housed. Pastures, roomy enough to accommodate large herds of\r\nhorses and cattle, securely enclosed, supplied with water and the proper\r\nshelter. Small herds of fine cattle and horses secured and well provided\r\nfor. These herds were selected chiefly for breeding purposes, while a\r\nsufficient number of mules were purchased for the needs of the farm\r\nwork. The bees in the well stocked apiary had already gathered a fine\r\nsupply of honey from the wild flowers of the surrounding prairies. The\r\nextensive yards and buildings prepared for poultry farming on an\r\nunusually large scale, were so well stocked and in such fine condition\r\nas to promise large profits at an early day.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the work at the close of the first year, which included\r\nmany important items not yet enumerated, the general results were so\r\nsatisfactory that the officers and members of the Solaris Farm Company\r\nwere very much encouraged. Owing to sales of seeds and brick in such\r\nconsiderable quantities, together with the manufacture at the farm of\r\nalmost every kind of building material, the sum advanced by Fern\r\nFenwick, the patroness, for farm buildings and equipment was less than\r\none-half the amount named in Fillmore Flagg's estimate. The amount\r\nrequired for the coming year would be very much less.\r\n\r\nThe general plan provided for and embraced the supplementing of\r\nagricultural work by a series of allied manufactures, such as naturally\r\ngrew out of the needs of the farm: carpentering, blacksmithing, machine\r\nwork and repairing, furniture making, turning, polishing, painting,\r\nstaining and general wood working and finishing, pattern making, broom\r\nand brush making, a factory for spinning rope and cordage, basket and\r\nall kinds of osier weaving, brick making, pottery and all kinds of clay\r\nor porcelain work; together with many other things that would suggest\r\nthemselves as time passed and the capacity of the farm was increased by\r\nthe invention of better machinery and superior methods.\r\n\r\nThe application of inventive genius on the part of the co-operators to\r\noperations at the brick works and pottery, had already proved equal to\r\nthe demands of any emergency which might arise. The great variety of\r\nthese added employments would afford a pleasant change from the monotony\r\nand routine of ordinary farm work. They could be pursued sometimes for\r\nweeks together, when legitimate farm work would be out of season, in\r\nthis way so greatly increasing the products and profits of the farm,\r\nthat the bonanza farm of the capitalist, which depended on wheat growing\r\nalone for profits, could no longer successfully compete.\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion by the board of management and the officers of the\r\ncompany, it was decided with the unanimous consent of the membership,\r\nthat eight hours should be considered a day's work--six hours for the\r\nfarm work, with two hours additional to be devoted to such of the\r\nmanufacturing works as the member might choose. This course proved\r\nentirely satisfactory; it soon gave to the farm an able corps of skilled\r\nworkmen, at the same time augmenting the collective power of the\r\nmembership to do more effective co-operative thinking for the\r\nadvancement of the best interests and general welfare of all.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of wages, a uniform price of three dollars per day was\r\nfixed for each member of the company; this amount was diminished by\r\ndeducting ten per cent for the sinking fund, five per cent for the\r\ngeneral service fund, and five cents daily from each member for the\r\nspecial fund. The special fund was for the purposes of education and\r\namusement. After subtracting these deductions, two dollars and fifty\r\ncents were left as the net per diem pay of each one. The assessments\r\nprovided the goodly sum of $54,000 00 annually for the sinking fund,\r\n$27,000 00 for the general service fund, and $9,000 00 for the special\r\nfund.\r\n\r\nThe Solaris Farm company was incorporated for ninety-nine years, with a\r\nprovision for re-incorporation at the expiration of that period. This\r\nprovision practically made the company a perpetual institution. The\r\nstock of the company was capitalized at $250,000 00, and divided into\r\none thousand shares, with a par value of $250 00 each. The number of\r\nshare holders or subscribers was limited to five hundred adults, about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty couples or families; at the end of five years, two\r\nshares of stock were issued to each subscriber, male or female, married\r\nor single. This stock, however, could not be issued until $45,000 00 had\r\nbeen paid into the sinking fund. With the issue of the stock, the\r\npurchase price of the farm should be paid from the sinking fund to\r\nFillmore Flagg, the trustee, who would then deed the farm to the\r\ncorporation. Thereafter the company was to maintain a sinking fund amply\r\nsufficient to provide such additional farms as the children of its\r\nmembers might need.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his instructions from Fennimore Fenwick, the money\r\nreceived in this way by Fillmore Flagg, was to be held by him as a\r\ntrust for the purchase of other farms. It was further provided that the\r\nSolaris Farm company retained the sole right to purchase all stock which\r\nmight be offered for sale.\r\n\r\nThe general service fund was to be used in defraying the expense of\r\nstocking, equipping and improving the farm.\r\n\r\nIt was also determined that settlements made with members, who from any\r\ncause might wish to leave the company, should be made on a basis of two\r\ndollars and fifty cents per day for the time they had been co-operators,\r\nwith the return of whatever capital they might have invested plus\r\ninterest at three per cent per annum; all stock subscribed for to return\r\nto the company's treasury.\r\n\r\nThe general plan further provided for the erection of separate cottages,\r\nwith small gardens adjoining, for the use and occupancy of such families\r\nas might desire them. The apartment house, now completed, had many of\r\nits suites of rooms arranged for independent housekeeping, but so far,\r\nthe members of the company preferred to take their meals at the company\r\nrestaurant, paying for them the ordinary prices. They also preferred to\r\npatronize the laundry, general clothing, tailoring and dress-making\r\ndepartments which were connected with the company store. To prevent any\r\nconflict with the commercial interests of the outside world, the\r\nrestaurant and the company store sold food and goods at the ruling\r\nmarket prices for first-class articles, realizing that it was plainly\r\nthe policy of the company to keep only the best of everything for\r\nsale--the generous profits from all sales to go as a general\r\ncontribution from the entire membership to the insurance fund for the\r\nhelpless and the aged. As liberal wages afforded ample means, large\r\npurchases were encouraged, and all tendency toward a miserly hoarding\r\nwas discouraged. It was marked that all the members were quick to\r\nappreciate the fact that the more liberal their purchases, the more\r\ngenerously they swelled the fund that was set apart to provide for the\r\nneeds and happiness of declining years. With each passing month it was\r\nobserved that this particular feature of insurance continued to grow in\r\npopular favor.\r\n\r\nTo enable the company to dispense with a great deal of expensive\r\nbookkeeping, to do business with a small amount of actual cash, and at\r\nthe same time add another check against the disposition to hoard money;\r\nthe payment of wages to the members of the company was made in Solaris\r\nscrip, good at its face value for all purchases made from the company.\r\nWhenever cash was needed by any of the members, an order on the\r\ntreasurer drawn by the president and approved by the general manager,\r\ncould easily be obtained for reasonable amounts. On presentation of the\r\norder, U. S. legal tenders to the amount specified, would be exchanged\r\nfor the scrip, dollar for dollar; the treasurer cancelling this scrip by\r\nstamping across its face the date of the exchange and the name of the\r\nmember, retaining the cancelled scrip as his voucher for the\r\ndisbursement of the money. When scrip was exchanged at the store for\r\ngoods, it was cancelled in the same way by the manager of the store. The\r\nplan seemed to work without friction and gave general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each month an executive committee, composed of three\r\nmen and three women, was chosen by the members of the company. This\r\ncommittee, with the general manager as chairman, made an order of work\r\nfor each day and assigned the members to the different kinds of work\r\nnamed in the order. These assignments were always accepted cheerfully.\r\nThe co-operators without exception and without murmur worked steadily\r\nand with zeal for one common result. They were keenly alive to both the\r\nimportance and the advantages of this new kind of co-operative work,\r\nwhich gave them so many hours of leisure for rest and recreation. With\r\nthe experience of each passing month, they realized more than ever\r\nbefore that sixteen hours out of the twenty-four so devoted, soon\r\nstimulated and reinforced the vital energies to such an extent that\r\nactive labor seemed really desirable. As a matter of fact, each day they\r\nbegan to look forward eagerly to the six hours of farm work and the two\r\nhours additional of skilled labor, as opportunities which gave them\r\nrefreshing and delightful exercise. Exercise that was necessary to\r\npromote health and happiness--exercise which left them with an added\r\nrelish and brighter mental conditions for the enjoyment of the hours of\r\nstudy and amusement that were to follow. Here again, the wisdom of\r\nnature's law of compensation was demonstrated. A grave question of the\r\nutmost importance to the progress of mankind was for them forever\r\nsettled. The discovery had dawned on the minds of these people that\r\nlabor, no longer a curse, was in reality nature's richest blessing!\r\n\r\nAmong the more important improvements on the farm which Fillmore Flagg\r\nhad carefully planned, was the necessary preparatory work on the large\r\npropagating gardens, located near the river, not far from the village.\r\nIn connection with the construction of the village water works, at the\r\ntime of the grading and sewering of the village grounds, these gardens\r\nwere furnished with a complete system of irrigating pipes. These,\r\ntogether with the thousands of pots required at a later period, were\r\nmade in the pottery at the brick works--another product of farm labor.\r\nWith such a complete control of the necessary moisture, the sprouting\r\nprocess in the long seed beds proved unusually successful. These beds,\r\nwhich covered several acres of very rich soil, were thickly planted with\r\nall kinds of fruit and tree-bearing seeds; together with grape cuttings,\r\nmulberries for the silkworm culture, quinces, currants, tea plants, a\r\ngreat variety of berries, a fine selection of ornamental shrubbery,\r\ndwarf fruit trees, roses, and many other plants besides. The young\r\nplants soon reached a stage of growth where potting became necessary in\r\norder to make them strong, well grown, independent young shoots, ready\r\nat any time to be transplanted without injury into nursery rows, the\r\nvineyard or the berry plots.\r\n\r\nTo pot the contents of these beds required the labor of many hands,\r\nconsequently the task furnished a pleasant, congenial employment for a\r\nmajor part of the female co-operators. A large, well floored, wide\r\nroofed shed was constructed just at the edge of the gardens nearest the\r\nvillage. It was wide enough to accommodate two rows of roomy tables, and\r\nof a length sufficient for fifty tables in each row. Adjoining the end\r\nof the potting shed towards the village, was the storehouse, containing\r\nquantities of prepared soil and a large supply of assorted pots. A\r\ndouble track system of narrow tramways passed between the rows of\r\ntables, on its way from the storehouse to the different seed beds in all\r\nparts of the garden. On this tramway the little cars came from the\r\nstorehouse to the tables, laden with supplies of pots and prepared\r\nsoil; these they exchanged for trays of potted plants to be returned to\r\nthe seed beds. In returning from the gardens on the other track, they\r\nbrought cargoes of shallow trays filled with little plantlets just\r\nlifted from the seed beds. This cargo-bearing process, on the part of\r\nthe tram cars, continued throughout the day as often as required, making\r\nlight work for all concerned. To witness the work under the shed as it\r\ngoes bravely on is a pleasing sight. Let us pause a moment to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAt each table are two operators, who may sit or stand while they work.\r\nProtected by strong gloves, the deft fingers swiftly fly--the long,\r\ndouble lines of maidens and matrons are as merry as crickets! The buzz\r\nof musical chatter, song and story, inspires the work, fitting time with\r\nswift pinions and transforming such toil into six hours of fun and\r\nfrolic!\r\n\r\nThis class of work proved so charming that a majority of the women\r\npreferred it to employment in the apiary, dairy, nursery, school,\r\noffice, restaurant, or any department of the company store.\r\n\r\nWith this glimpse of the general development of Solaris Farm, its\r\nimprovements and its people, during the first year, we discover that\r\nFillmore Flagg has been a very busy man; that his skill, inventive\r\ngenius, and executive ability have been tried severely; that he has been\r\nable to respond to the demands of every occasion. However, such was his\r\nconfidence in the wisdom of Fern Fenwick, that when he found himself\r\npuzzled or in doubt, he relied largely on her advice to suggest some\r\nproper solution for each vexing question. He had, from the beginning,\r\nfurnished her with a complete history of every stage of the development\r\nof the farm, along with his weekly reports. At the close of each one he\r\ngave a list of topics on which her opinions were solicited; the\r\nsuggestions in her replies led to such a speedy unraveling of the\r\ntangled situations and troublesome questions, that Fillmore Flagg was\r\nimpressed more than ever, with her excellent judgment and the brilliancy\r\nof her genius. His admiration grew; his love grew faster! In his\r\npersonal letters, transmitting the weekly reports, the expression of\r\nthese sentiments of admiration and adoration continued to grow in force\r\nand fervor until he finally gained courage to request permission to\r\naddress her as a lover: a lover whose happiness would be largely\r\nincreased by every effort he might make to put in words the thoughts\r\nborn of his devotion to her--the one adorable woman in the world, for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn her reply, Fern Fenwick frankly stated that she was inclined to\r\nconsider his request with some degree of favor. That she had sought\r\nadvice from her parents. That in response her father, Fennimore Fenwick,\r\nhad expressed himself as convinced of the integrity, honesty, and purity\r\nof Fillmore's love for her; but he could not consent to an engagement\r\nbinding his daughter to marriage, until the unqualified success of the\r\nmodel farm, at the end of the first five years, had demonstrated the\r\nworthiness of Fillmore Flagg. After that event, if both continued to\r\ndesire a marriage engagement, his consent might be considered as\r\nassured. Her mother, she said, had repeated and emphasized her father's\r\nadvice: this advice she felt in duty bound to heed and respect.\r\nTherefore, on the conditions named, she was willing to accept him as a\r\nlover, with the distinct understanding however, that he must not claim\r\nher hand in marriage until after the achievement of the complete\r\nsuccess of Solaris Farm.\r\n\r\nIn the postscript at the close of her letter, Fern adroitly, though\r\nperhaps innocently, lighted the torch of hope in the heart of Fillmore\r\nFlagg by archly expressing herself as follows: \"Henceforth my personal\r\ninterest in the progress and final success of the model farm will, no\r\ndoubt, fully equal your own.\"\r\n\r\nThis little postscript was a never failing source of comfort and\r\nencouragement to Fillmore Flagg. He read it and re-read it again and\r\nagain: in his ecstacy he caught himself kissing it a dozen times the\r\nfirst week after it reached him. With each reading his hitherto dormant\r\nlove nature gathered force and intensity. In the throbbing tide of\r\njoyful emotions, he was suffused with a strange new happiness. He\r\nblushed like a girl as the certainty came home to his heart that at last\r\nhis love for this beautiful woman was returned. It may be marked as\r\nnoteworthy that this important letter came to Fillmore Flagg just eight\r\nmonths after his parting with Fern Fenwick at her cottage home on the\r\nHudson. While meditating and luxuriating under the spell of the happy\r\nsignificance of this event, as affecting his future life, he thanked his\r\nangel friends for so successfully speeding his wooing. With this\r\nassurance he was confident that at last his star of destiny was dominant\r\nin the sky of love. Calmly serene, he could now await the approach of\r\nwhatever trials in life the future might have in store for him. Nothing\r\ncould shake him from this fortress of love! Nothing could intervene to\r\nseparate his life from the life of his beloved Fern! With a sigh of\r\ncontentment, he prepared to devote himself more ambitiously and more\r\nindustriously than ever before, to the development of Solaris Farm. He\r\nwooed every inventive thought; he planned night and day to overcome all\r\nobstacles that presented themselves. In his letters to Fern Fenwick,\r\nrejoicing in a freedom to express himself without restraint on the\r\nlimitless theme of his great love for her, he filled page after page\r\nwith eloquent adoration of his heart's chosen one--his highest ideal of\r\nthe glorious perfection of womanhood. The effect on Fillmore Flagg of\r\nthis fervent, all-absorbing love, was most excellent; it broadened and\r\npurified his life, eliminating from it all the dross of selfishness. He\r\ntook a new interest in the lives of every married couple and every pair\r\nof lovers on the farm. By persevering effort, tact and skill, he\r\ncompletely won their confidence. He shared their hopes, plans, joys,\r\nsorrows, loves and crosses. In all this he never once failed to increase\r\ntheir love for him and their devotion to the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCLUB LIFE AT SOLARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the work of building up in the minds of the co-operators, an abiding\r\nfaith in Solaris Farm and its future success, Fillmore Flagg had the\r\nable support of George and Gertrude Gerrish. They had proved themselves\r\nthe right people in the right place! In the schools and nursery Gertrude\r\nhad become invaluable. Her genial temperament, her fondness for\r\nchildren, the kindly influence of her great mother-heart, with its never\r\nfailing store of sympathy, patience, tact and skill, all attested that\r\nshe was a natural teacher whose presence among the children was a\r\nperpetual benefaction, while the wonderful store of her personal\r\nmagnetism brought her the love, respect and obedience of both the old\r\nand the young. They instinctively felt her power to make them wiser,\r\nbetter and happier. This was a well merited tribute of praise, worth a\r\nking's ransom in gold!\r\n\r\nGeorge Gerrish soon became very popular on account of the extraordinary\r\nability he displayed in organizing the members of the farm company into\r\nthe numerous clubs devised to promote the interests of education,\r\nscience and amusement. The description which follows will serve to\r\nillustrate his skill as an organizer in carrying out the general plan\r\nprepared by Fillmore Flagg. In addition they will give a clear idea of\r\nthe scope and variety of the talent developed, together with a proper\r\nconception of the splendid equipment of the farm for the social,\r\neducational, ethical and scientific development of its people.\r\n\r\nFirst in order came the Press Club. To it was assigned the duty of\r\nediting and publishing the \"SOLARIS SENTINEL,\" a weekly paper devoted to\r\nthe interests of the farm. It was filled with topics of general interest\r\nto the community; themes, essays, poems, personals and social notices\r\ncontributed by the club members, suggestions and ideas leading to better\r\nmethods for the care and culture of the farm stock and crops, also as to\r\npreparing, the same for market. The range of topics included hints\r\nregarding any of the allied manufacturing industries which were carried\r\nforward by the farm company. In addition the paper gave full weekly\r\nreports from the officers of the different clubs. The literary budget\r\nfor each week was completed by selections from the general contribution\r\nbox, a very large one, which was fastened to the outer door of the rooms\r\nof the club. Into this box every man, woman and child was invited to\r\ndrop such written scraps, signed or unsigned, brief or lengthy, as they\r\nmight be moved to offer for publication. The selections from this box\r\nwere eagerly read. They often proved surprisingly brilliant, novel or\r\nsuggestive, frequently disclosing rare literary merit,--altogether\r\nconstituting the most popular department of the paper. The editorials\r\nwere carefully prepared and well written. They were usually along lines\r\nof co-operative work; its desirability as an encouragement to\r\nunselfishness, and also to show how the work might best improve social,\r\nindustrial and political conditions. The volume and excellence of the\r\nreading matter thus produced, was marked by general comment as a matter\r\nof astonishment. The unstinted praise which it elicited reflected much\r\ncredit on the club: therefore to be chosen a member was a coveted honor\r\nwhich was reserved for the meritorious few.\r\n\r\nThe Dancing Club, in point of popularity, was the most successful of\r\nall, and deservedly so. Its membership embraced the entire colony, both\r\nold and young who, one and all, seemed to enter into the spirit of the\r\nmovement with a zealous abandon, a united joyousness, most delightful to\r\nbehold. The social ties which bound them together, grew and strengthened\r\nwith the recurrence of each meeting. On two afternoons of each week, the\r\nclub teachers gave two-hour lessons or drills to all who might desire\r\nthem. On three evenings of each week, in the large hall of education and\r\namusement, two and one-half hours were devoted to dancing, in which all\r\nthe members took part. These evening dances proved so fascinating that\r\nas a rule very few members were ever noted as being absent. An attack of\r\nillness which prevented the attendance of a member, must be desperate\r\nindeed. In the matter of general improvement the results were most\r\nexcellent. To bestow perfect deportment, dignified control of the body\r\nand limbs, with an easy, graceful movement on all occasions, there is\r\nnothing like dancing. To eliminate the depressing effects of grief,\r\nmental or business cares, harassing trials of temper, physical\r\nexhaustion, or disturbed spiritual equilibrium, dancing is a remedy of\r\nmarvelous potency. For the key to the reason why this is true, we are\r\nindebted to the wonderful discoveries in psychology and psychurgy made\r\nby that able scientist, renowned thinker and brilliant writer, Professor\r\nElmer Gates. The following is a very brief statement of his reasons as\r\nto how and why the emotions of the individual affect the vital forces of\r\nlife:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The human body is a collection of co-operative cells, more or less\r\n     intelligent and responsive, therefore an important part of the\r\n     thinking machine which is acted upon by the superior mind of the\r\n     brain. The superior mind is in turn reacted upon by the automatic\r\n     metabolism set up in the cells. Automatic metabolism of the cell,\r\n     is its ability to carry on within itself the various processes of\r\n     life that may be necessary to best fit it for the performance of\r\n     special functions, as a particular part of the co-operative body.\r\n     Violent emotions of anger, hate, despair and grief, are katabolic,\r\n     poisonous and harmful; they tear down and destroy life. The\r\n     poisonous deposits left in the cells by these emotions are called\r\n     'katastates.' Laughter and merriment, with all the emotions of\r\n     pleasure, adoration, worship, love, affection, hope, beauty, etc.,\r\n     are 'anabolic,' or life-preserving. The vital, health-giving\r\n     deposits left in the cells by these emotions are called\r\n     'anastates.' Nature accomplishes her perfect work by beautiful\r\n     methods. The cells are fed and sustained by the circulation of the\r\n     blood; they are reached from the smaller branching arteries by a\r\n     network of minute, thread-like channels, sometimes called\r\n     'arterioles.' These arterioles are accompanied by the equally fine\r\n     wires of the nervous system, closely connected with the brain\r\n     centers. These wires are electrified by the emotions; they expand\r\n     the arterioles, and the cells are flooded with an unusual supply of\r\n     blood; thus they are correspondingly vitalized or poisoned,\r\n     according to the kind of the dominant emotion, its duration and its\r\n     intensity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing we readily perceive that the joyful emotions stirred\r\nby that poetical trinity, the melody, the rythm and motion of dancing,\r\narouses the circulation so potently that every cell in the body tingles\r\nwith its superabundance of vitality; both the heart and the brain\r\nrespond to the invigorating tide, while its precious freight of\r\nanastates is vivifying and thrilling every cell. These happifying\r\nemotions soon become permanently dominant, the depressing emotions grow\r\nweaker, fade away and disappear. The individual is vitalized and\r\nrejuvenated! We begin to understand that when properly indulged in,\r\ndancing is the most fascinating, healthful and helpful of all the\r\namusements. The Solaris Farm people were both fascinated and benefited\r\nby the dancing exercises so generously provided by the club; the growing\r\ninterest and enthusiasm aroused was a matter of astonishment even to\r\nthemselves. With the continuation of the club dances, the intensity of\r\nthe enjoyment and the capacity for it, seemed to increase; this,\r\ntogether with the pleasing memories of bygone dances, seemed to bind\r\nthem yet more closely to the destinies of Solaris Farm. Strong,\r\nstraight, lithe figures, happy faces, and eyes shining with the fires\r\nof perfect health, gave testimony to the efficacy of music and motion as\r\napplied to physical development. With grateful hearts, these happy\r\npeople realized that this pure font of happiness came to them as the\r\nresult of unselfish, harmonious co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe effect on Gilbert Gerrish of this universal spirit of gaiety, was as\r\nmarked as it was beneficial. On the raised platform at the head of the\r\ndancing hall, violin in hand, and surrounded by a chosen few of his\r\nfriends in the musical club, he seemed to grow in stature as he breathed\r\nin the pervading merriment; living a new life, in which his deformity no\r\nlonger marred his pleasure. Through the association of many months he\r\nhad grown accustomed to the personal magnetism of the farm people. They\r\nwere very proud of him and of his many brilliant accomplishments. This\r\nall-pervading sentiment of loving pride came to him as a benediction,\r\nwhich his refined, sensitive nature graciously absorbed. His shyness and\r\nreticence disappeared; his face glowed with the flush of happiness; his\r\nbeautiful eyes shone with the fires of a new inspiration. With the hand\r\nof a master he swept the strings with a bow of magic; new strains of\r\nsweet, thrilling music stirred the dancers and moved them as one mass to\r\nthe throbbing rythm of the intoxicating melody: a melody so charming\r\nthat none could resist. Filled with the power of a new grace and dignity\r\nat such moments, Gilbert Gerrish felt a keen triumph in his ability to\r\nstir the emotional natures of these people whom he loved; to inspire\r\nthem to better deeds and to nobler lives. They, in turn, recognized and\r\npaid willing homage to a noble soul, a great genius, whose power to sway\r\nand control them was not in the least deflected or dimmed by a thought\r\nof his deformed body. Under the mystic spell of divine music, which\r\nappeals to the highest aspirations of the human heart; which calls forth\r\nthe hidden forces of the soul: they came in such perfect rapport with\r\nhim in his inner life, that they sensed with soulful eyes the strong,\r\nradiant, symmetrical spirit shining through the defects and barriers of\r\na fleshly prison. Thus transfigured, they saw him, not as he appeared to\r\nordinary mortals, but as he really was. To these people of Solaris, this\r\ntransfiguration was lasting. Very soon they came to regard him as a\r\ntalisman of good fortune--the mascot of the farm.\r\n\r\nThe Photographic Club, organized by George Gerrish soon after the press\r\nclub with the intention of making it the nucleus of a future art club,\r\nproved a surprising success at an early stage of its existence. Very\r\nsoon after active work began, fifty members had been enrolled. In\r\ndiscussing with the executive committee a general plan of formation,\r\nFillmore Flagg remarked that he felt very sure the club would soon prove\r\na valuable aid to the farm in the direction of furnishing attractive\r\nillustrations of the farm itself, its products, stock, fruits and\r\nflowers, to be used as advertisements. With this in view, he made\r\narrangements to provide suitable rooms, large, well lighted and fitted\r\nfor the work, in connection with the construction of an isolated\r\nbuilding, made as nearly fire-proof as possible which, when finished,\r\nwas to be devoted mainly to the needs of farm experiments in the\r\ndepartment of agricultural chemistry. The completed rooms, with a large\r\nlot of cameras of various sizes, together with an abundant supply of\r\nphotographic material, were placed at the disposal of the working\r\nmembers of the club. These things were rightly considered a necessary\r\npart of an educational outfit. Fillmore Flagg and George Gerrish both\r\nwere skillful photographers: with the wise guidance of two such able\r\nteachers, the class soon began to produce creditable work. After the\r\nexpiration of a fixed period, in compliance with an imperative club\r\nrule, each member was obliged to complete all work from start to finish\r\nwithout assistance. This would give scope and opportunity for\r\nexpressions of spontaneity and inventive genius in the individual\r\ntreatment of the work, which might tend to the evolution of superior\r\nmethods. It was clearly an advantage for the members to be able to say\r\ntruthfully that photographs produced under such requirements were\r\nactually the results of their own individual handiwork; from focusing\r\nthe object, timing the exposure of the plate, on through the various\r\nstages of developing, toning, printing and mounting, up to the final\r\nprocess of polishing the finished picture. At the end of each month the\r\nmembers individually were required to submit twelve finished photographs\r\nto the inspection of a committee of five. This committee was composed of\r\ntwo ladies and two gentlemen in addition to Fillmore Flagg, who was the\r\nchairman. From this collection of twelve lot pictures, representing the\r\nfinest work of the club, the committee selected four photographs from\r\neach lot, which were chosen to become a part of the farm exhibit to be\r\ndisplayed on the walls of the library, hall of education and the\r\nschool-rooms. This monthly award for meritorious work acted as a\r\nwonderful stimulus to all the club members, so increasing their\r\nambition, industry and artistic invention, that an ever increasing\r\nnumber of delightful surprises followed each monthly examination. In\r\nconsidering the selections as a class, the extent and variety of the\r\nsubjects treated covered a wide range. Among them we may name the\r\ngeneral and special views of the farm, its buildings, fields of grain,\r\ncorn, cotton and broom corn; bits of forest, meadow or brookside\r\nlandscapes; specimens of the different vegetables and garden products;\r\ninterior views of the different buildings; photographs of groups and of\r\nindividual members of the company; pictures of manufactured articles,\r\ntableware, ornamental brick and tile work, and general pottery; a great\r\nvariety of cabinet work, furniture and willow ware; splendid photographs\r\nof horses, mules, cattle, sheep, hogs and poultry, also wild animals and\r\nbirds, singly and in groups; views of trees, streams, roads, bridges and\r\nrailroad trains; enlarged photographs of the insect enemies of farm\r\nproducts; others of the birds which prey upon such insects; artistic\r\nviews of seed beds, nursery rows, potting sheds, brick and pottery\r\nworks--in fact, pictures of every possible aspect of the agricultural\r\nand manufacturing industries on the farm. Taken together, this\r\ncollection presented a most interesting series for the school rooms,\r\nwhich proved an object lesson of great value to both pupil and teacher.\r\nThe landscapes were especially excellent in giving correct ideas of\r\ndistance values in perspective drawing.\r\n\r\nAs time passed, the inventive genius of the club members began to crop\r\nout in the repair shop, where they not infrequently, and sometimes much\r\nto their surprise, found themselves able to construct better and cheaper\r\ninstruments, lenses and attachments than they were able to buy. With\r\nthese improvements they soon achieved success in color photography.\r\nLater this led to making magnificently colored slides for stereopticon,\r\nkinetescope and biograph exhibits, which soon attracted wide attention\r\nand were in such demand that a large trade resulted. In this way another\r\nexceedingly profitable allied industry was added to the now famous\r\nSolaris Farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nFENWICK HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the infancy of this Republic, when its government was looking about\r\nfor a permanent home, Gen. Washington was moved to found and lay out the\r\nCity of Washington as its Capitol. With a marvelous prescience he\r\nforesaw the coming needs and future greatness of the newly-united\r\nstates. Impressed with visions of the glorious destiny awaiting his\r\nbeloved people, his cherished republic, he wisely concluded to provide\r\ngenerously for the growth of a magnificent city which, a century later,\r\nshould reflect credit as the capital of a mighty nation. Careless of the\r\ngibes and sneers of many of his most intimate friends, Washington, the\r\nfar-seeing statesman, the invincible soldier, deliberately planned,\r\nplatted and surveyed through the wilderness of forest at that time\r\ncovering the great triangular basin lying between the Heights of\r\nColumbia and the waters of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers; such a\r\nbewildering array of broad streets, wide avenues, and roomy public\r\nparks, as would be ample and suitable for a brilliant city like Paris,\r\n(whose system of streets he had taken as a model,) at least sufficient\r\nfor the wants of a population of a half million. The dawn of the\r\ntwentieth century saw a complete realization of General Washington's\r\nbrightest hopes, a verification of his prophetic visions. The wand of\r\nprogress had transformed the straggling village of \"magnificent\r\ndistances,\" into the most royally beautiful city on the continent. A\r\ncity which had become the pride and delight of one hundred millions of\r\nfree people, who individually felt a personal interest in the vastness,\r\nthe beauty and the imposing grandeur of its magnificent public\r\nbuildings, which represented the crowning loveliness of architectural\r\ndesign, the highest artistic expression of American genius; altogether\r\nmost perfectly and fittingly adorning the unrivaled capitol city of the\r\nmost progressive, powerful, and meritoriously dominant republic on the\r\nface of the planet! To this Mecca of republics, as the social and\r\npolitical center of the western hemisphere, came the great thinkers,\r\nscientists, artists, orators and statesmen of the world.\r\n\r\nCommandingly situated on Columbia Heights, overlooking this surpassingly\r\nbeautiful city, was Fenwick Hall, the home of Fern Fenwick. The Hall was\r\na large quadrangular structure of imposing appearance, erected in the\r\ncenter of spacious grounds, most charmingly laid out, with a rare\r\ncombination of lawn, flowers and shrubbery. The material used in its\r\nconstruction was Seneca sandstone, in color a rich dark red, and was\r\ntrimmed with a pale mottled green stone, quite as beautiful as\r\nserpentine. The effect of the combination was as harmonious as it was\r\nornamental. The main building was four full stories in height above the\r\ndeep basement. It was made more conspicuous and more picturesque by the\r\nfour octagonal towers, one-half of which projected from each corner of\r\nthe building. These beautiful towers of a uniform size, rose thirty\r\nfeet above the roof of the building itself. The basement and towers were\r\nof rough green stone; the caps and sills of the long, deep windows,\r\ntogether with the arcade, were of green stone, beautifully carved and\r\npolished. The arcade, which served both as a covered way, and a portico\r\nover the main entrance, was at once artistic and unique. It was formed\r\nby a picturesque combination of four Moorish arches. These arches were\r\nuniformly twenty-five feet in height and twenty-five feet in width: the\r\nopenings of the double arch were placed in front with the single\r\nopenings at either side. By this arrangement the beauty of the entire\r\nstructure was greatly enhanced, while a very appropriate entrance to\r\nFenwick Hall was the result.\r\n\r\nAt the rear of the grounds, on a line with the center of the mansion,\r\nwere the roomy stables. They were built of rough Seneca sandstone. Like\r\nSwiss cottages, they were made more beautiful by a profusion of richly\r\ncolored slates which covered the broad, steep roof and the wide eaves.\r\nBetween the mansion and the stables, on the same line, twenty-five feet\r\ndistant from the former, was the pretty two story building, of the same\r\nmaterial, devoted to the kitchen, the heating and the lighting plants.\r\nBoth buildings were connected with each other and with the main building\r\nby a long colonnade of harmonious proportions; its heavy cornice,\r\nnarrow, steep roof, and long double line of slender supporting pillars,\r\nwere all of the same red stone. The color effects offered by the lovely\r\ncontrast between the velvety green of the broad, smoothly shaven lawns\r\nand the rich reds of the Seneca stone, were simply delightful!\r\nArchitecturally considered, the combined effect of the group of\r\nbuildings, arcade and colonnade, was as artistic as it was excellent.\r\nUnder the arcade, just inside the double arch, a broad flight of stone\r\nsteps led up to the heavy oak doors opening into the wide hall on the\r\nmain floor. This hall was remarkable for its unusual size; it was thirty\r\nfeet wide and of a proportionate height, fifteen feet from floor to\r\nceiling. In connection with a cross hall twenty feet in width, it served\r\nto divide the entire space on this floor--one hundred and sixty feet by\r\nninety--into four very large rooms; the two parlors, the library, and\r\nthe dining room: each one thirty feet in width by seventy feet in\r\nlength, with fifteen foot ceilings.\r\n\r\nThe grand proportions of these magnificent rooms and stately halls,\r\nexcited universal admiration; they impressed the beholder with a\r\ndominant idea of the spacious luxury which marked the interior\r\nappointments of Fenwick Hall. In the center of the main hall, thirty\r\nfeet from the front entrance, began the flight of the grand stairway.\r\nThe general design of this stairway was boldly unique. It was in harmony\r\nwith the scale of magnificence which characterized the halls and\r\nparlors. In three long flights of twenty-five steps each, it rose to the\r\nfourth floor. Counting the fifteen-foot landings on the second and third\r\nfloors, it was practically one structure with a generous breadth of\r\nfifteen feet. It was built of the same material--American mahogany--with\r\ncasings, cornices, banisters and newels of the same pattern and finish,\r\nall highly polished and rich with ornamental carving. The beautiful\r\ncolor effects of the polished mahogany, were brought out more vividly by\r\nthe pale neutral tint of the heavy velvet carpet, which covered the\r\nstairs and landings. As an illustration of the great space occupied by\r\nthis grand stairway of such ideal proportions, each one of its\r\nseventy-five broad steps would afford a comfortable seat for eight\r\npersons--a goodly company of six hundred, all told. This royal trinity\r\nof stairways ranked as the distinguishing feature of the mansion. They\r\ngave it an air of stately elegance, tempered with the glow and warmth of\r\na generous hospitality.\r\n\r\nThe halls on the second and third floors were counterparts of the main\r\nhall in size and style. The hall on the fourth floor was fifty feet wide\r\nby one hundred and sixty feet long. It was arranged to be used as a ball\r\nroom, or for concerts, lectures, operas and theatricals. For such\r\nevents, it would comfortably seat an audience of one thousand people.\r\nThe roomy stage was furnished with the latest and most approved\r\nappliances; it was also equipped with a remarkable series of twelve drop\r\ncurtains for the lectures. Number one of the series, was a twelve by\r\ntwenty-four foot map of the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii,\r\nPorto Rico and other territorial possessions. This map was accurately\r\ndrawn to a large scale, it was artistically colored and marked in such a\r\nway as to show at a glance the boundaries of original territory; the\r\nceded territory, the date of cession, and from whom acquired; the\r\ndividing lines between states and between counties; the location of all\r\ncities and towns having a population of one thousand or over; the\r\nprincipal state and county roads, all railroads, lakes, rivers,\r\nmountains, public parks, valuable forests, arid lands, irrigable lands,\r\nmineral deposits; all noted mines of coal, iron, gold, silver, copper,\r\netc., together with a great variety of important items: all of which\r\nproved exceedingly valuable as an added means by which to illustrate in\r\nan interesting and comprehensive way, lectures on geographical,\r\ngeological and historical subjects, together with lectures on the\r\nnatural wealth and resources of our country; its manufacturing, mining,\r\ncommercial and agricultural interests, with a great number of kindred\r\ntopics as well. The second curtain was uniform in size with the first\r\nand with the entire series. On the same large scale, it gave a\r\nmagnificent illustration of the solar system. The background was a pale\r\nbluish gray. The sun appeared as the central figure, surrounded by the\r\nplanets in their orbits, carefully drawn as to comparative size and\r\nposition. The whole map was colored with exquisite taste in perfect\r\nharmony with the beautiful sky effects of the background. The skillful\r\nwork of the map maker proved especially strong in furnishing a lesson of\r\nwholesome humility for the over-proud denizens of the little planet\r\nEarth who, puffed up with much vanity, have for ages proclaimed the\r\nEarth as the pivotal center of all creation. The third curtain was\r\nsimply a heavy, plain white one, perfectly fitted for the display of\r\nstereopticon views, and more especially for the moving panoramic views\r\nof the kinetescope, the vitascope and the biograph, which have proved\r\nsuch attractive and entertaining aids to the general lecturer, dealing\r\nwith any special subject capable of such profuse illustration. The\r\nremaining nine curtains were devoted to outline maps of the world, and\r\nto illustrated object-lessons in the most important and interesting\r\ndepartments of nature.\r\n\r\nThe side walls of this remarkable hall were wainscoted in polished hard\r\nwood, for a distance of five feet above the floor: the remaining wall\r\nspace was divided into large ornamental panels, with beautifully\r\nscrolled historical borders. In these panels were painted, one in each,\r\nlarge maps of the States and Territories, which were drawn to uniform\r\nscale, minutely accurate, with every post office, post road, wagon road\r\nor cycle path plainly marked. In addition, at least twice the number of\r\ndetails usual to large maps showing counties and townships, were\r\ncarefully noted. The effect of this unique educational system of\r\nornamentation was as interesting as it was fascinating. In harmony with\r\nthis idea, the entire length of the broad ceiling overhead was painted a\r\npale blue; it was divided into two large panels with ornate borders;\r\neach panel was dotted with stars and planets in such a methodical way as\r\nto form a complete astronomical map of the visible heavens, both\r\nnorthern and southern hemispheres. This, with several of the large drop\r\ncurtains, served as adjuncts to the well equipped observatory which was\r\nlocated in one of the large towers at the rear of the mansion.\r\n\r\nOn the main floor, on each side of the front hall, were the two grand\r\nparlors, whose exact dimensions have been stated heretofore. They were\r\ncarpeted and furnished with all the art and luxury that skill could\r\ndevise, or wealth could procure. Two wide archways of Moorish style and\r\nmajestic proportions, opened from each parlor into the main hall. The\r\nchief adornments which marked these fine parlors as unapproachably\r\nsuperb, were two immense mirrors, alike in every way, mounted in heavy\r\nframes, rich with leaf gold. They occupied the entire wall space at the\r\nrear end of these enchanting saloons of artistic luxury. When\r\ndistinguished groups of brave men and beautiful women were assembled\r\nhere, the magical effect of these mirrors in reproducing the brilliant\r\ncompany as one magnificently framed panoramic picture, was ever the\r\nsource of perpetual admiration and delight. On such occasions the\r\nthirty feet of the main hall in front of the stairway, served as the\r\nthird or reception parlor. The grand stairway shone resplendent as one\r\nmagnificent centerpiece of loveliness. Up the long flight on either\r\nside, it was banked by a wealth of potted flowers, ferns and palms,\r\nfestooned with wreaths of lovely smilax. Just in front of this unrivaled\r\nbackground of beauty, standing alone upon the movable reception\r\nplatform, which was merely a small circular extension of the first step\r\nof the grand stairway, the charming young hostess of Fenwick Hall, with\r\nthe grace and courtesy of a born princess, gave a greeting of welcome to\r\nher delighted guests, or dismissed them with a gracious smile as they\r\nentered or retired.\r\n\r\nThe library, in the rear of the parlor at the left of the main hall and\r\nseparated from it by the cross hall, was an exceedingly imposing and\r\nattractive room. With its quiet array of costly appointments, it seemed\r\nto possess some hidden charm. Its mahogany shelves were laden with a\r\nrare collection of choice books, elegantly bound, skillfully arranged\r\nand classified. The assortment of scientific books was a remarkably\r\nlarge one. Marble statues, and exquisitely painted portraits of a host\r\nof famous authors and artists, whose works had enriched the literature\r\nof the world, fittingly adorned this ideal realm of drowsy quiet, where\r\nboth lore and luxury reigned supreme.\r\n\r\nThe dining room was uniform in size with the parlors and the library.\r\nIts walls and ceiling were frescoed with groups of graceful figures,\r\nwhich represented the merry sprites of pleasure in carnivals of\r\nfeasting, song and dancing. Each figure was a carefully studied type of\r\nbeauty; each group a perfect expression of grace and gaiety. Studied\r\nsingly or as parts of the entire composition, they were exquisite as\r\nworks of art, charming the attention of the beholder with a bewildering\r\nfascination. The floor was one vast mosaic of superbly colored tiles.\r\nThe heavy mahogany tables and sideboards were glittering with their\r\ncostly equipments of shining silver, sparkling cut glass, and rare,\r\ntranslucent china. Large oval mirrors in heavy carved frames, duplicated\r\nthe lovely adornments of this brilliant room from a dozen points of\r\nvantage. The dazzling effect of this home of the feast, was intensified\r\nby cascades of light from the two unrivaled chandeliers. They supported\r\na great number of slender bulbs containing the electric lights, which\r\nwere arranged in the form of a mass of drooping fern leaves, rising like\r\na pyramid of soft radiance, into the perfect shape of two superb\r\nfountains. Tiny streams of short prisms, clear, flashing, crystal,\r\npendant and vibrating, formed the tip of each fern leaf. This skillful\r\ncombination seemed to complete the startling illusion of this rare\r\nvision of loveliness, until one could almost hear the musical tinkle of\r\nfalling water.\r\n\r\nThe three halls on the main, second and third floors, were really\r\ngalleries of art \"par excellence,\" they were so profusely adorned with\r\nchoice collections of photographs, etchings, water colors, paintings and\r\nstatuary. On entering the main hall, two very large paintings of\r\nextraordinary significance and rare merit claimed instant admiration.\r\nCompanion pictures, each with a canopy and background of crossed\r\nAmerican flags, from whose voluminous folds shone the blazing glory of\r\ncolor in the matchless beauty of the stars and stripes. In each picture\r\nunder these flags, the dominant spirit of the republic breathed in the\r\nnoble figures so exquisitely painted; typifying in the one on the right,\r\nthe Goddess of Liberty watching over the destiny of the republic. In the\r\none on the left, Liberty with her torch lighting the world. So perfectly\r\ndid the painter's art portray the \"Spirit of '76,\" that a new tide of\r\npatriotic devotion to the republic and its glorious flag, swelled the\r\nhearts of all who saw these justly famous pictures.\r\n\r\nThe well lighted, well ventilated rooms in the basement were used as\r\nstore rooms, a suitable number being set apart for the servants, as\r\ndressing rooms, dining room and sitting room. In a large bay window\r\nextension at the rear of the main hall, a sumptuously furnished elevator\r\nconnected the basement with all of the halls, the roof and the towers.\r\nThe rooms on the second and third floors were arranged in suites of\r\nthree: reception, sleeping and bath. In size, fittings and furnishings,\r\nthey were models of comfort and luxury.\r\n\r\nThe four octagonal tower rooms were uniformly twenty-five feet in\r\ndiameter, with lofty dome ceilings. The right front tower was occupied\r\nby Fern Fenwick as her private study and work room. It was fitted and\r\nfurnished much the same as the library. The left front tower was\r\narranged as a seance room for spiritual manifestations, and more\r\nespecially for the different phases of mediumship possessed by Mrs.\r\nBainbridge, including materialization. As before stated, the right hand\r\ntower at the rear was perfectly equipped as an observatory, while the\r\nrooms under it were devoted to the demonstration of kindred sciences.\r\nThe left tower at the rear was furnished and arranged as a laboratory.\r\nThe rooms under it were set apart for experiment and demonstrations in\r\nchemistry, metallurgy, photography and several other sciences of like\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAn able corps of carefully trained servants, under the direction of Mrs.\r\nBainbridge, the housekeeper, made it easy to keep this remarkable\r\nestablishment in perfect order. One and all, these model servants were\r\ndevoted to their lovely young mistress, and this devotion was based on\r\ntheir keen appreciation of her noble ideas in regard to the true purpose\r\nof human life, to her high estimation of its sacredness. They were eager\r\nto serve her faithfully and well for less than ordinary wages, contented\r\nand confident in the knowledge that, in accordance with her clear sense\r\nof justice, they were sure of being retired on half pay after having\r\nreached the age of fifty-five. This brief description of the exterior\r\nand interior of Fenwick Hall, its equipment, its lovely mistress and its\r\npeople, will but faintly suggest its extraordinary possibilities as a\r\npotent factor in the upper circles of Washington life. Almost three\r\nyears have passed since the transition of Fennimore Fenwick, which left\r\nhis only daughter, Fern Fenwick, as the sole heir to his vast wealth.\r\nWith the exception of three months each summer, spent at Fairy Fern\r\nCottage, or some mountain resort near it, she had remained quietly at\r\nFenwick Hall, busily engaged in rebuilding and refitting it. Meanwhile\r\nunder the instruction of able teachers, she had been hard at work in\r\nefforts to supplement her excellent collegiate education with a better\r\nknowledge of history and by a more complete mastery of the subtle\r\nsecrets of the higher sciences, as exponents of the powers, properties\r\nand purposes of the inherent forces belonging to the various\r\ndepartments of Nature's vast domain.\r\n\r\nAfter much deliberation she had undertaken this work to enable her to\r\nwisely prepare and plan for a life work in harmony with her lofty ideas\r\non the subject--ideas which had been slowly ripening in her mind for\r\nmany months. Having passed the ordeal of this severe post graduate\r\ncourse of general study, she felt herself prepared to commence the work\r\ncontemplated by her general plan, which embraced a skillful use of the\r\ngreat educational and social advantages of Fenwick Hall, in her\r\nendeavors to bring to the leading minds of the political and social\r\ncircles of Washington a clear conception of the importance and\r\nsignificance of the real purpose of human life; with a view to reforming\r\nethical, social, industrial and political organizations on the true\r\nbasis of the unselfishness of the individual for the advancement of the\r\nrace; thus bringing these organizations into exact and co-operative\r\nharmony with the object and purpose of the existence of the planet.\r\nSystems so organized, would then be in line with a true conception of\r\nthe functions of an ideal republic--a government for the people, of the\r\npeople and by the people; conducted for the benefit, protection and\r\ndevelopment of all the people. With the world organized into families of\r\nsuch republics, the advent of the millennium could be predicted, and the\r\nadvancement of the race to the point of perfection would be insured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a careful review of her historical studies, Fern Fenwick came to\r\nthe conclusion that the competitive system was responsible for a\r\nmajority of the evils which had so retarded the world's progress. She\r\ndiscovered that this same system was the father of a conscienceless\r\ncommercial spirit which had existed for many centuries as the basis of\r\nall social organization. That as such, it was a constant menace to all\r\ngood society; the embodiment of a cruel selfishness of a savage type,\r\nwhich insisted that might makes right--that the strong should thrive by\r\npreying upon the weak. In this position it boldly denied the immortality\r\nof the soul, so far as the weaker workers were concerned. Therefore the\r\ncheap lives of these poor people had no claim to be considered as\r\nsacred, because they represented so many human souls. In the absence of\r\nany practical or effective protest from the religions of the world, this\r\nmonstrous system of selfishness had in all these years, grown unchecked\r\nand unmolested in its methods of cruel greed. From the shadows and gloom\r\nof these threatening conditions, existing so manifestly in direct\r\nviolation of all progressive law, came a demand that the negative belief\r\nin the immortality of the soul, be speedily replaced by a positive\r\nknowledge of it. A knowledge sustained and supported by practical\r\ndemonstrations, through the action of natural law, whose manifestations\r\nand demonstrations should be so direct and indisputable as to appeal\r\nconvincingly to the hard headed thinkers, who as a class, seemed to\r\nrepresent a materialistic element that threatened to overthrow all\r\nbelief in immortality.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this demand, about the beginning of the last half of the\r\nnineteenth century, there happened an event of the utmost importance,\r\npotent with promise for the mighty spiritual unfoldment and general\r\nadvancement of the people of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nIn the humble home of the Fox family, at the little village of\r\nHydesville, near Rochester, New York, by the co-operative efforts of\r\nmortals and spirits, there was constructed and established a line of\r\ncommunication between the two worlds--the mortal and the spiritual. Two\r\nlittle children, the Fox girls, were the mediums, a combination of\r\noperator and electric battery--or, in other words the necessary\r\ninstruments for successful spiritual telegraphy. In this obscure home of\r\nthe poor and lowly, in a quiet way, unheralded and unannounced, there\r\ncame to the world a knowledge of the existence of one of nature's\r\ngrandest laws, the law of mediumship; thereafter the way was open, on\r\nthe physical plane of existence, for an unlimited series of practical\r\ndemonstrations of the immortality of the human soul: the continuity of\r\nconscious life was substantiated by an endless variety of proofs of the\r\nmost convincing character.\r\n\r\nWith this solution, of the destiny of the human soul as an immortal and\r\nimperishable entity, came the solid ground on which to build a permanent\r\nfoundation for a social and industrial organization, on a basis of\r\nunselfish, harmonious co-operation in perfect accord with planetary\r\nevolution, and the real object and purpose of human life.\r\n\r\nThis strong combination of the working factors of the problem,\r\nsuggested to the mind of Fern Fenwick the importance of first attempting\r\nto interest the minds of the people she wished to control, in the\r\nquestion of immortality as a natural fact that followed the dual nature\r\nof all human life, as a result of planetary evolution. Once interested,\r\nshe could then convince them of the immortality of the soul, as a\r\nconscious, imperishable entity, by practical demonstrations through the\r\nlaw of mediumship.\r\n\r\nThese demonstrations would make it clear to them that life on the\r\nphysical plane of existence is transitory and ephemeral; somewhat in the\r\nnature of a very brief period of primary experiences; that life on the\r\nspiritual plane of existence is permanent and enduring; that therefore\r\nthe pathway of progress for the human soul must be almost entirely\r\nwithin the realms of the world of spirit; that this great truth should\r\nhave careful consideration when dealing with questions affecting human\r\nlives; that the dominant immortal spirit of the dual individual\r\npossesses a corporeal body, or mortal form, as a crude outward\r\nexpression of the indwelling spirit in its earthly existence; that this\r\nmortal form enfolds all the possibilities of a life of eternal\r\nprogression for the Ego or spirit as a conscious identity on the\r\nspiritual plane of existence; that the change called death is a natural\r\none, to be approached calmly without a fear; that it is really a new\r\nbirth, which does not disturb the continuity of life.\r\n\r\nOnce convinced of the verity of these great truths, all lovers of\r\nhumanity, all progressive people, all earnest thinkers, would readily\r\nunderstand and appreciate the sacredness of human life, as the flower\r\nand fruit of the planet--its highest expression; they would then be\r\nprepared to co-operate with any progressive movement for the\r\nadvancement of the race.\r\n\r\nTo make the necessary conditions for the accomplishment of this great\r\nwork was the grand purpose of Fern Fenwick's Washington life. With this\r\npurpose in view, Fenwick Hall had been especially fitted and equipped.\r\nFor this she had cultivated a large circle of acquaintances among the\r\nfashionable leaders of the best society of the Capital City. Caring but\r\nlittle for the ceaseless round of soul-wearying social functions which\r\nso completely absorbed these people; yet filled with a determination to\r\nwin them to a higher life, she bore herself bravely through the season\r\nwhich proved one long procession of social triumphs. Inspired by the\r\nintensity of a grand purpose; endowed with a clear, musical voice,\r\nperfect health, youth and beauty, combined with a charmingly\r\nirresistible personal magnetism; armed with the quiet dignity of\r\nperfect self-control, and the genius of her brilliant mind, so broadly\r\ncultured; an adept in psychic lore; an entertaining and eloquent\r\nconversationalist, our heroine created a profound sensation in the most\r\nselect circles of the social world. Everywhere she was the center of\r\nattraction, surrounded by admiring throngs of cultured people,\r\nrepresenting wealth and leisure, who hastened to pay homage to her as a\r\nTwentieth Century society goddess, whose wand of magic controlled\r\nmillions of money. In the homes of the exclusive few, she was hailed as\r\na thrice welcome guest; celebrities, ranking high as statesmen,\r\nsoldiers, poets, artists, authors, representative professional men and\r\nleading men of business, were completely charmed and curiously\r\nfascinated by this new queen of the social realm, and vied with each\r\nother in eager efforts to win her favor and perhaps her friendship, in\r\nthe hope of gaining admittance to the very limited circle of fortunate\r\npeople who were the recipients of invitations to the famous dinners,\r\nreceptions and entertainments at Fenwick Hall. These people\r\ninstinctively felt the attractive power of some silent, mysterious\r\nforce, some high motive, which, combined with dazzling beauty and\r\nbrilliant genius, drew them to her side, without the wish or power to\r\nresist.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenal wave of popularity continued to increase until a choice\r\nof the best people in every branch of the social world, was at the\r\ncommand of this new leader of the exclusive set; they were ready to\r\nassist in carrying forward any progressive movement she might choose, by\r\nher championship to make the fashion. However, this universal\r\nwillingness to follow her leadership, seemed based on a firm conviction\r\nin some way unconsciously established in the minds of her devotees, that\r\nall of Fern Fenwick's plans and purposes were for the good of humanity,\r\nwisely guided by a skill and judgment most remarkably rare--apparently\r\nfar beyond her years! The whole situation was a complex problem they\r\ncould not analyze: they did not even try!\r\n\r\nWith the advent of modern spiritualism in 1848, came the first\r\nopportunity to bring woman forward as a teacher and leader in the great\r\nwork of elevating and spiritualizing the masses. As a heritage from her\r\nsister oracles, who spake in the mystic temples of the ancient past, the\r\nmodern woman was endowed with the divinity of a rarely sensitive and\r\nhighly refined spiritual organization. By virtue of this endowment, she\r\nspeedily demonstrated her peculiar fitness for this new mission. Her\r\neloquence and inspiration charmed the multitude from a thousand\r\nrostrums. Her work in this new field was so startlingly brilliant,\r\nimportant and successful as to attract the attention of the whole\r\ncivilized world; affording a remarkable object lesson which demonstrated\r\nher possession, as the mouth-piece of inspiration, of a wonderful\r\nmagnetic power to sway the people; to enthuse, interest and educate them\r\nup to higher mental, moral and spiritual conditions; by making them\r\naware of the vast import of the true purpose of human life; by helping\r\nthem to realize to a limited degree, the significance of immortality,\r\ntheir individual responsibility in relation to the universe, as\r\nimportant factors in the evolutionary advancement of the race toward the\r\nmillennium of its final destiny.\r\n\r\nThese inspired teachings touched a responsive chord in the hearts of all\r\nwomankind as they began, dimly at first, to perceive the all-pervading\r\nforce and rythm of the dominant key-note to the evolution of the race,\r\nwhich in thunder tones ever proclaims the mighty truth, that all\r\nprogress of the race depends entirely upon the elevation, education and\r\nrefinement achieved by woman. They also began to understand something of\r\nthe glorious possibilities of a perfected womanhood, as a regenerator of\r\nmankind. A magnificent array of future victories for woman's work loomed\r\nup before them as a command to awake; to prepare for the coming dawn of\r\nthe twentieth century--the beginning of a new cycle in the life of the\r\nplanet; the commencement of woman's golden era! To woman the command was\r\nimperative that she must strive for more wisdom, for more light on her\r\nholy mission as the evangel of evolving life; that she might reach a\r\nhigher consciousness of her individual responsibility as the keeper and\r\nguardian of the sacred temple of human life--a temple in which is ever\r\nrepeated the evolution, ontogeny, and phylogeny of the race; where, by\r\nthis most mysteriously beautiful of all processes, there is constantly\r\nbeing welded together the planetary growth, physical, mental and\r\npsychical experiences of ages upon ages in the past; with the higher,\r\npurer, better and more spiritual possibilities of the race in its\r\nplanetary progress for uncounted ages yet to come.\r\n\r\nFrom this general awakening there followed--for the purpose of securing\r\nthat practical education of training, which actual contact and\r\nindividual experience alone can confer--a vigorous effort on the part of\r\nthe brightest and most progressive women of the Nineteenth Century, to\r\nenter, singly and as organizations, into all the activities of life.\r\nHampered by the blinding prejudice of a long line of centuries; many of\r\nthese earlier organizations, as might have been foreseen, were\r\nunsparingly criticised as exhibitions of ill-directed foolishness,\r\naltogether crude, unprogressive and unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, the\r\ndominant spirit of courageous and persistent effort, combined with high\r\npurpose and pure motive, soon won the approval of the better classes and\r\naccomplished a marked improvement in both work and method. This rapid\r\nimprovement pointed unerringly to future achievement of that success\r\nshown in the conditions which prevailed at the close of the century,\r\nwhereby woman was very generally recognized as a necessary and\r\nsuccessful co-worker in all the suitable employments of life.\r\n\r\nFern Fenwick, in full sympathy with the movement, was alive to the\r\ndemands of the situation. With the purpose of concentrating the efforts\r\nof all the women's organizations which held their annual conventions in\r\nWashington, into one channel, leading to perfect motherhood, as the\r\nresult of woman's social and financial independence; she identified\r\nherself with them as a generous contributor. Soon she became the friend\r\nand trusted adviser of all of the leaders. She placed Fenwick Hall at\r\ntheir disposal, for use as a general headquarters. In this way, a wise\r\ndirection of the combined women's movement into a united work along\r\nlines in harmony with planetary evolution for the perfection of the\r\nrace, became an integral part of Fern Fenwick's broad plan for a life\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBy the end of Fillmore Flagg's first year at Solaris Farm, Fern Fenwick\r\nhad matured her plans for her own peculiar work. Much to her\r\nsatisfaction, the necessary conditions had been created, the whole\r\nmovement organized and well in hand. Fillmore's work for the education\r\nand elevation of the agricultural classes, had given her energy and\r\ninspiration to accomplish a similar and co-operative work among people\r\nof wealth and leisure, who, ignorant of the true object and purpose of\r\nlife, were unwittingly wasting precious years in leading indolent and\r\naimless lives, by lending themselves body and soul to the care and\r\ncanker of the fashionable game of killing time. One year's experience\r\nhad taught her that the task was a difficult one, to accomplish which\r\nrequired time, patience and perseverance, reinforced by courage, skill\r\nand tact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nHIS WOOING PROSPERS WHILE OUR HERO ENJOYS HIS FIRST VACATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFern Fenwick's interest in the experimental farm was intense. She read\r\nwith eagerness the weekly reports from Fillmore Flagg, which were\r\naccompanied by such charmingly ardent love letters. She was very proud\r\nof the success he had achieved in two short years. She blushed as she\r\nthought how dear to her he had become in those busy months which swiftly\r\npassed. How much she should miss him and his fascinating love letters,\r\nif by evil chance anything should happen to take him away from her! She\r\ncould not contemplate such a possibility without a shudder. Now that her\r\nstudies were finished and her plans perfected, why not send for him to\r\ncome to Fenwick Hall for a week's vacation? He had certainly earned the\r\nprivilege which he would prize so much. The opportunity to personally\r\ncompare notes and exchange suggestions would no doubt prove helpful to\r\nthe farm work and to her own. She longed for the confidential\r\ncompanionship of some one who was in perfect sympathy with her, who\r\ncould understand her work, and appreciate her motives in carrying it\r\nforward; some one who would be able to advise her wisely and\r\nunselfishly; one in whom she had implicit confidence. Who so capable and\r\nso desirable as Fillmore Flagg? Acting on the impulse of the moment, she\r\nwrote the letter directing him to come at once.\r\n\r\nTo Fillmore Flagg, the summons to Washington proved as welcome as it\r\nwas unexpected. He came at the earliest possible moment. The hope of\r\nagain meeting the noblest, sweetest, and dearest woman in the world for\r\nhim, his heart's idol; of again being permitted to look long and\r\nlovingly into her gloriously beautiful eyes, stirred his emotional\r\nnature intensely, and fired his throbbing pulse with the fever of\r\nimpatient expectancy. The beautiful words of the poet Dennison, in his\r\n\"Night Ride of a Lover,\" were ever in his mind and on his lips. Over and\r\nover again he murmured:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Though fleet as an arrow he flies,\r\n     Though sundering space swiftly dies,\r\n       My heart cries 'Oh haste!\r\n       All time is a waste\r\n     'Till I drink of her soul at her eyes!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe speediest express train seemed a laggard, left far behind in the\r\nrace of the journey by his swift desire, which kept pace with the\r\ntelegram announcing his departure from Solaris and the probable time of\r\nhis arrival in Washington. At length his heart was made glad by a\r\ndistant glimpse of the dome of the Capitol, which seemed to give him a\r\nwelcome greeting as it marked his approach to the great city. He found\r\nFern Fenwick's carriage, with Mrs. Bainbridge waiting for him at the\r\ndepot. Half an hour later he was shown into the library at Fenwick Hall,\r\nwhere in radiant beauty his blushing sweetheart gave him a royal\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nAs he approached her, with shining eyes and face aglow, soul and body\r\nradiant with the grace and adoration of his all-absorbing love, the\r\nheroic order of his manly beauty thrilled the heart of Fern Fenwick with\r\nits irresistible charm. The kisses claimed by a lover's privilege, she\r\nwas powerless to deny. Nay! she did not try to hide the shining light\r\nof a great happiness from the adoring eyes of such a noble lover, whose\r\nmagnetic presence stilled the tumult of her fluttering heart with the\r\necstatic calm of a measureless content; that unmistakable signature of\r\nsanction, that crowning seal of nature's approval which greets the\r\nmeeting of kindred souls, who, mated in the warp and woof of the web of\r\ndestiny, in the flashing flight of Cupid's dart, become the harmoniously\r\nunited halves of a perfect whole.\r\n\r\nAh, thrice happy, thrice blessed, thrice crowned lovers! How swiftly\r\npassed those golden hours, as hand in hand, they sat entranced, with\r\nsoulful eyes in silent communion, dreaming and drifting in the\r\ncloud-land of love's harvest-moon, in whose silvery mist they lost all\r\nconsciousness of the existence in this world of aught else beside\r\nthemselves!\r\n\r\nThe next morning after his arrival at Fenwick Hall, Fillmore Flagg\r\nhaving breakfasted with Fern Fenwick and Mrs. Bainbridge, accompanied\r\nthe former to her work room in the tower. Here, as had been arranged on\r\nthe previous evening, she gave him a complete account of her work in\r\nWashington, since the transition of her father. She also gave the\r\ndetails of her general plan for enlarging the scope of the work to\r\ninclude the women's movement and of directing the combined work in such\r\na way as to become an aid to the work of the model farm.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Fillmore,\" said Fern, \"How are you impressed by my scheme for\r\ncarrying out the chosen plans? Can you suggest anything that may be of\r\nassistance to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your scheme,\" replied Fillmore Flagg, \"is a glorious one which promises\r\nto start a revolution in the aristocratic circles of society. It\r\nimpresses me profoundly, as a deep laid plot, cunning and strong, which\r\nmust accomplish a vast amount of good for the interests of humanity. So\r\ndeep, so broad and so vast are its possibilities, that a week devoted to\r\nstudy and reflection would but poorly prepare me to understand its\r\nsignificance or perfection as a whole, much less to pronounce judgment\r\nupon it. But at this moment, of one thing I feel sure--that the noble\r\npurpose which has inspired your skill and genius in the construction of\r\nthis remarkable plan, which deals so effectively and practically with\r\nhuman life as the result of planetary evolution, will prove a sure guide\r\nto success. The plan itself, in all of its details, is already so\r\nperfect, in my estimation, as to leave nothing for me to suggest by way\r\nof improvement. It is characteristic of you and of your capacity for\r\nbrilliant work! I am, more than ever before, amazed at this exhibition\r\nof your intellectual greatness, which demonstrates your power to think\r\nso deeply and plan so wisely. I am very proud of you! I am especially\r\ngrateful for this opportunity to burn incense as a worshipper at the\r\nshrine of your genius! You ask to what extent will the work affect the\r\ndestiny of woman? I answer, its possibilities in that direction are\r\nlimitless! They are beyond the power of any living mortal to comprehend!\r\nWith woman surrounded by such conditions of financial independence, and\r\nsuch harmonious environments as will permit her to devote the best\r\nenergies of her soul to the perfection of the highest type of\r\nmotherhood, there will come a solution of the problem of how best to\r\naccomplish the perfection of the race. Surely, generations far in the\r\nfuture shall rise up to call you blessed! Dearest, best and noblest of\r\nwomen! Go forward bravely without a fear for the result. Undoubtedly\r\nyour plan possesses all the elements of success. With the talisman of\r\nyour goodness and beauty as the moving force, you cannot fail. Whatever\r\nI am capable of doing to assist you, I shall do gladly, with all my\r\nheart and strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my dear Fillmore,\" said Fern, \"your words of assurance and\r\napproval, so beautifully expressed, have appealed potently to all that\r\nis good and spiritual in my nature. They have inspired me to better and\r\nnobler deeds. They are very grateful to me and I prize them highly.\r\n\r\n\"Now that you are so much interested, I feel sure you will be able to\r\nhelp me in thinking out some problems which puzzle me. For instance:\r\nFrom among the people I have interested, I wish to select and\r\nconcentrate the dominant thinkers and workers of both sexes and from all\r\nclasses, into some kind of a club organization, for the purpose of still\r\nfurther perfecting the efficiency of organized co-operative effort.\r\nQuestion: Shall this society take the form of a club? If so, what name\r\nshall I choose for it? In its formation what method shall I use? Can you\r\nevolve anything from your inner consciousness in answer to these\r\nquestions?\"\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in the intensity and earnestness of her questioning spirit,\r\nFern Fenwick left her chair and as her interrogatories came to an end,\r\nshe stood by the side of Fillmore Flagg, looking straight into his eyes\r\nwith such a penetrating, magnetic glance, that for some moments he was\r\nunable to reply. With his beautiful curl-crowned head thrown back to\r\nmeet and return her entrancing gaze, he breathed but slowly and for the\r\nmoment seemed rigid as a man of marble; a far-off, dreamy look shone\r\nfrom his half closed eyes. Presently, with a long sigh, speaking very\r\nslowly and softly, he said: \"Ah! Miss Fenwick, I think I see what you\r\nare reaching out for. Your idea is coming to me now quite clearly.\" Then\r\nwith returning animation he continued: \"Yes, I grasp the idea; it is\r\ncapital! I believe I can help you. I would suggest the use of the club\r\nformation without using the word 'club' in its title. I would call it\r\n'The Twentieth Century Cosmos.' I would choose for its badge of\r\nmembership a small silver fern leaf, crossed by a large gold key. I\r\nwould advise that you alone, as the founder and sole director of the\r\nclub, should have the power to select the members, and to decorate them\r\nwith the badge of membership. To be in harmony with the century idea,\r\nthe number of members should be limited to one hundred. All meetings of\r\nthe club should be held in suitable rooms at Fenwick Hall; these rooms\r\nshould be known as Cosmos Court. Admittance to each meeting should be\r\ngained by the presentation at the door, of an invitation, printed on\r\nclub paper, bearing the name of the member, giving the date and stating\r\nthe object of the meeting, all duly attested by your written signature\r\nas director.\r\n\r\n\"The object and purpose of the existence of the club may be stated as\r\nfollows: That its membership may secure, by the harmonious association\r\nof properly qualified minds,--which shall represent the dominant\r\nthinkers in all departments of knowledge--a higher, broader conception\r\nof the possibilities and purposes of life; as the necessary basis which\r\nshall make it possible to acquire a larger store of cosmic wisdom, by\r\nthe use of systematic methods of co-operative research, study and\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"This system of formation for a club would certainly be unique. I\r\nbelieve it will prove to be especially well fitted for the\r\naccomplishment of your peculiar work. Does the plan proposed meet your\r\napproval by offering satisfactory answers to your questions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! my dear Fillmore,\" said Fern, \"what a darling, clever boy you are,\r\nto be sure! Now it is my turn to praise your wisdom and your genius. I\r\nthink your plan is an excellent one, which will suit the exigencies of\r\nmy purpose most admirably. Before you return to Solaris we will consider\r\nthe details more at length. Now let us change the subject.\r\n\r\n\"In keeping you so long at my work, how selfish and thoughtless I have\r\nbeen! I shall try to make amends! I have planned to make your brief\r\nvisit as pleasant as possible. To-day I must show you over the house and\r\ngrounds. In the afternoon we shall take a long drive which will give you\r\na glimpse of the beautiful streets, buildings, parks and monuments of\r\nour lovely city. Each afternoon these drives are to be repeated, until\r\nyou are familiar with the great possibilities of this city of destiny,\r\nthis priceless gift--the perpetual home of the government of the\r\nnation--from General George Washington, who is forever enshrined in the\r\nhearts of the people as the founder of the republic, the father of his\r\ncountry! When you return to our farm people, I wish you to be able to\r\nimpress them with the matchless beauty, vastness and importance of the\r\nCity of Washington, the political center of this unrivaled republic. It\r\nis my great desire to have them always think of it and speak of it with\r\nlove and pride, with feelings of individual proprietary interest, as\r\nthey realize that they are important factors, as voters and working\r\nunits of the government, in the great work of shaping its destiny.\r\n\r\n\"As you are the guest of honor at Fenwick Hall, I am going to do my\r\nbest to make you, for one week, the happiest man in town! The evenings\r\nare to be devoted to the theatre, the opera, and to various society\r\nevents at Fenwick Hall, arranged for your especial benefit and\r\nedification.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Fern,\" said Fillmore, \"How good and kind you are! To be near\r\nyou, to hear your voice, to look into your beautiful eyes; is paradise\r\nfor me! A week so full of happiness, I shall cherish as the one week of\r\na lifetime! As to these society events of which you speak, I shall be\r\njealous of each moment so devoted which shall take you from my side.\r\nPray then, my good angel, do make such moments as short as possible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rest assured, my knight of the farm, you shall have no cause to\r\ncomplain,\" said Fern, with a saucy smile as she laid her hand\r\ncaressingly on his arm. \"You are to come with me, prepared to look and\r\nlisten, while I show you the beauties of my Washington home!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the \"Saint Louis Express\" left the Washington station, westward\r\nbound, Fillmore Flagg caught a final glimpse of Fern Fenwick, as with\r\ncharacteristic grace and enthusiasm she continued to wave a parting\r\nsalute with her dainty lace handkerchief, until the train had vanished\r\naround the curve. With a sigh he returned to his seat to muse over the\r\nevents of the week which had passed so sweetly yet so very swiftly for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nYes, Fern had kept her pledge up to the last moment. As the guest of\r\nhonor at Fenwick Hall, she as hostess, in all the graciousness of her\r\nbewitching beauty, marked by such charming tenderness, had made him\r\nconscious each day that he was indeed the happiest man in town. He now\r\nreturned to Solaris with renewed courage and enthusiasm, to prepare for\r\nthe celebration at the farm of the coming arbor-day festival, which Fern\r\nhad promised to attend. As this celebration was to mark her first visit\r\nto Solaris Farm, he wished most ardently to have it prove a great\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe events of the past week had been a revelation to Fillmore Flagg: a\r\nhost of new attributes to the noble character of Fern Fenwick had shone\r\nforth and dazzled him by their unexpected brilliancy. He began to\r\nrealize what a wonderful woman she was in this new role, as the queen of\r\nthe select set in the aristocratic circles of Washington society.\r\n\r\nHer strange power to mold the minds of these people; to make them strive\r\nfor the accomplishment of social and industrial reforms, which meant the\r\nredemption of the masses, impressed him most profoundly. By what\r\nremarkable process had she, in so short a time, achieved such commanding\r\nheights of intellectual and spiritual greatness? Heights, where by\r\noperating from the vantage ground of the social and political center of\r\nthe republic, like some chief marshal on the broad field of human\r\nevents, she could, by the unseen and irresistible power of hypnotic\r\nsuggestion, inspire, guide and control the causative and law-making\r\nforces which so powerfully affect all social and industrial conditions.\r\nWas it possible that spiritual unfoldment alone, could confer such\r\nmarvelous power? Apparently in response to the intensity of his\r\nquestion, came the reply:\r\n\r\n\"When a person representing combined physical, intellectual and\r\nspiritual unfoldment, is inspired by a noble, unselfish desire to\r\naccomplish a great good for all human life, by the use of methods that\r\nare in conjunctive harmony with the evolutionary progress of the planet:\r\nthen such a desire acquires an irresistible force. Naught can prevail\r\nagainst it! In compliance with the demands of a wise cosmic law, it has\r\nreceived the omnistic seal of nature's approval.\"\r\n\r\nThe clearness and wisdom of this unexpected reply, appealed strongly to\r\nthe reason of Fillmore Flagg. Profoundly moved, yet outwardly calm, he\r\nperceived at once that the truth of the statement was absolute! In the\r\nnew light of this remarkable revelation, he wished to carefully examine\r\nthe claim of the model co-operative farm to the seal of nature's\r\napproval. Were the desires, the ideas and the methods in conjunctive\r\nharmony with planetary evolution? Apparently they were! That the success\r\nof the model farm meant the elevation and future happiness of humanity,\r\nwas true beyond question. Equally so was the intensity and unselfishness\r\nof the desire which had inspired his action and the acts of Fennimore\r\nFenwick and his daughter, Fern. Surely then, the project bore the\r\nunmistakable stamp of approval which foretold success! It could not\r\nfail! It must succeed! It was irresistible and invincible!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nA SURPRISE PARTY AND RECEPTION COMBINED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the train approached the station at Solaris, Fillmore, in blissful\r\nignorance of coming events, began to prepare himself to leave the coach.\r\nIn response to a letter from George Gerrish, he had wired from St.\r\nLouis the time of his arrival. As he was stepping from the train to the\r\nlong platform, his hand baggage was seized by trusty hands and quickly\r\ndisappeared. He noted with amazement the gaily decorated station and the\r\nthrong of waiting people. Before he had recovered from his surprise,\r\nGertrude Gerrish, evidently striving to assume a very dignified\r\ndeportment, advanced to meet him. As she gave him a hearty welcome, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"As the leader of the reception committee, representing the membership\r\nand children of the Solaris Farm Company, who are gathered here in\r\nholiday attire, unanimous in a desire to do honor to you; I greet you! I\r\nwelcome you back to Solaris Farm!\"\r\n\r\nTurning quickly, with a wave of her hand, she said: \"People of Solaris,\r\nthree cheers for our General Manager!\" At this time, the train having\r\ndeparted, the farm people almost covered the platform with two deep\r\nlines, facing a narrow lane in the center, with heads uncovered,\r\nprepared and waiting for the signal. The response came instantly in a\r\nringing cheer from six hundred well-trained throats: \"Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\nHurrah for Fillmore Flagg! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome back to Solaris\r\nFarm!\"\r\n\r\nAlmost before Fillmore was aware of what had really happened, Gertrude\r\nGerrish had taken his arm, as with a mysterious smile she said: \"I am\r\nnow to escort you to the carriage prepared for your reception. We are\r\nthen to be escorted by the procession to the public square, in front of\r\nthe hall of education and amusement, where the final ceremonies are to\r\ntake place. Of course you are surprised! We have planned for that very\r\npurpose! So come along now without one word of protest! At the proper\r\nmoment you are to have as much time as you may desire in which to\r\nrelieve your mind. For the present you are to keep quiet and obey me--a\r\ndespotic master of ceremonies whose will is imperative and whose dignity\r\nis not to be questioned, even for a moment!\"\r\n\r\nFillmore Flagg, now obediently dumb, entered into the spirit of the\r\noccasion. He was very much surprised--nay, well-nigh dazed--yet withal\r\ndelighted, as the happy significance of this unexpected welcome came\r\nslowly into his mind. With hat in hand, bowing and smiling, arm in arm\r\nwith Gertrude Gerrish, he slowly passed between the long lines of happy\r\nfaces, keeping step with the throbbing measure of the soft sweet music\r\ndiscoursed by the band. At regular intervals, groups of gaily dressed\r\nchildren waved their pretty flags or playfully pelted him with roses. As\r\nthe twain reached the end of the lines, a novel chariot was waiting: a\r\nladder-wagon of the Solaris fire company, drawn by twenty brawny fire\r\nladdies, was equipped with a broad platform, beautifully draped, bearing\r\nat each corner a choice selection of fine large potted palms. In the\r\ncenter of this platform was a smaller one, raised still higher; on this\r\nwas placed the seat of honor, which was covered by a lovely canopy of\r\nartistically interwoven ferns and flowers. A broad flight of rough board\r\nsteps, carpeted and decorated, led up to the lofty seat on this unique\r\nchariot. While our hero and the \"Master of Ceremonies\" were climbing to\r\nreach it, the procession quickly formed about the chariot into an\r\nelongated hollow square, eight ranks deep; the children with their flags\r\nmarching in alternating lines of boys and girls, formed the front of the\r\nsquare, while the adults arranged in the same order, formed the sides\r\nand the rear. Gilbert Gerrish, with the band of musicians, selected by\r\nhim from the ranks of the musical club, was placed in front of the\r\nsquare. He was very proud and happy as he flourished his baton and gave\r\nthe signal for the procession to move forward. In this order they\r\nmarched gaily along the broad, tree lined avenue which led from the\r\nrailroad station to the village square. The chariot came to a halt just\r\nin front of the hall of education and amusement, with the seat of honor\r\nfacing eastward toward the center of the public square. The procession\r\nquickly reformed into three sides of a square, with the eight ranks\r\nfacing inward.\r\n\r\nFor a brief period silence reigned. Then at a signal from Gertrude\r\nGerrish, as Fillmore Flagg arose with uncovered head and stood by her\r\nside, the cheers and greetings of welcome were repeated by the ranks\r\nwith redoubled animation and intensity.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, George Gerrish came forward to the front of the raised\r\nplatform, while Gertrude, turning to Fillmore, said; \"The president of\r\nthe Solaris Farm Company has been chosen by its people to present to you\r\na gift which they have selected, as a tribute of their affection and\r\nalso of their devotion to you and to Solaris Farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"My esteemed friend and co-worker, Fillmore Flagg,\" said George Gerrish:\r\n\"As the mouth piece of our people, I am happy to be permitted to join in\r\nthe active work of this reception. The people of Solaris Farm, moved by\r\none impulse, inspired by sentiments of sincere friendship and\r\nenthusiastic loyalty, desire to present for your acceptance, this\r\nSolaris album, as a testimonial of their loving admiration; as a token\r\nof their absolute confidence in the wisdom of your leadership. This\r\nalbum contains photographs of all the members of the company. Each\r\npicture is endorsed with the signature and with the place and date of\r\nbirth of the individual. They are arranged and indexed in alphabetical\r\norder. Our people were guided to a choice of this gift because they were\r\nso profoundly impressed with the importance of the experiment\r\nrepresented by this farm. Because they felt so confident that its\r\nassured success would sound the key-note of a general movement for the\r\nemancipation and elevation of humanity by the gradual introduction of\r\nwiser and better social and industrial methods, which would eventually\r\nresult in the banishment of poverty and crime.\r\n\r\n\"Taking this view of the future, we may be pardoned for prophesying that\r\nfifty years hence, this album of the pioneers of the movement, will\r\npossess a greatly enhanced historical value. We trust, therefore, that\r\nthis possibility may make our gift more acceptable. I now ask you to\r\nreceive it in the spirit of love which inspired its donation. In\r\nconclusion allow me to assure you that under all circumstances, you can\r\ncount on the life-long friendship and loyalty of the people whose\r\npictures will greet you, as the years come and go, whenever you may feel\r\ninclined to look through the picture laden pages of Solaris Album.\"\r\n\r\nAs George Gerrish concluded his speech, a swelling storm of cheers for\r\nFillmore Flagg burst from the ranks of the square. Again and again came\r\nthe repeated roar of cheers, accompanied by the roll of the drums, and a\r\ncircling cloud of waving handkerchiefs, hats and flags. Fillmore Flagg,\r\ninspired by the enthusiasm and excitement of his cherished people,\r\nlooked very handsome and heroic as he stood with his manly figure erect,\r\nhis noble head thrown back, his eyes shining with emotion, the album\r\nheld firmly in his right hand. Bowing and smiling, he turned gracefully\r\nto face the greetings from the ranks of familiar faces, which were\r\nswaying with joy and shouting so wildly. Waiting for a few moments, he\r\nthen raised his left hand, with the open palm outward, as a signal for\r\nsilence. The tumult was stilled as if by magic.\r\n\r\n\"People of Solaris!\" he said; his clear, strong voice vibrating with\r\nemotion: \"To you, through your worthy president and your able committee,\r\nwith a grateful heart, I return my thanks for this most unexpected and\r\ncharming reception; for this beautiful and appropriate gift, which I\r\nprize much more than words can tell. Believe me when I say that I most\r\nthoroughly appreciate the noble sentiments which inspired its selection.\r\nI am delighted with the happy significance of this demonstration, as a\r\nprophecy of the complete success of this experimental farm. This\r\nexhibition of your loyalty to me and to Solaris Farm, fills my heart\r\nwith emotions of grateful joy. You have made me very proud and very\r\nhappy! I shall never forget the encouragement of your enthusiastic\r\nsupport, which has given me renewed vigor and strength to carry forward\r\nthe work. I now pledge to you my sacred word of honor that the golden\r\nmemories of this glorious occasion, and the possession of this precious\r\nalbum, shall henceforth inspire me to still greater efforts for the\r\nsuccess of our cherished enterprise, which means so much for us, so much\r\nmore for humanity.\r\n\r\n\"I am willing to acknowledge without a moment's hesitation, that your\r\nsurprise for me was skillfully planned; that its execution was\r\ncharmingly successful! I wish to return the compliment. I have a\r\nsurprise in store for you! The present moment is propitious; I will\r\ndisclose it! I am the bearer of a gift for you--a gift wisely chosen,\r\nwhich is in every way worthy of your admiration and appreciation. A gift\r\nof such exceeding value, that I cannot speak of it without becoming\r\neloquent. Gold and silver cannot measure its worth to you! Securely\r\npacked in strong cases, which are now lodged in our express office, is a\r\nrare collection of books. This collection contains ten complete sets of\r\nthe best text books for each one of the classified sciences, together\r\nwith the vocabularies, dictionaries, charts and drawings belonging\r\nthereto. Accompanying each set is a miscellaneous collection of the best\r\nworks written descriptively on that particular science. These books are\r\nintensely interesting and very valuable, although they are not classed\r\nas text books. Altogether the five hundred volumes form the finest and\r\nmost comprehensive collection of scientific works I have ever seen. They\r\nare the most useful and expensive books published that can be found in\r\nthe whole range of scientific literature. They contain the knowledge we\r\nmost need in our enterprise, to enable us as an associated body of\r\npeople to do better, wiser and more effective co-operative thinking and\r\nworking.\r\n\r\n\"To meet and satisfy our needs in this direction, these books were\r\nchosen as a gift to our library, by Miss Fern Fenwick, the beautiful and\r\ngenerous patroness of Solaris Farm. She desires me to emphasize her wish\r\nthat you abstain from any public expression of thanks. In lieu thereof,\r\nshe prefers to accept the measure of your diligence and enthusiasm in\r\nacquiring the stores of knowledge thus offered, as the most appropriate\r\nand satisfactory measure of your gratitude to her for the gift.\r\n\r\n\"To master the contents of these books, is to master the sum of human\r\nknowledge in the various departments of science. With this mastery there\r\nwill come to us the largest understanding, and the clearest obtainable\r\nconception of our relations toward each other, and to the universe\r\naround us. Thus enlightened, we may discover that ignorance is a sin;\r\nthat as responsible entities in the great pulsing sea of cosmic life,\r\nwith more or less power to help or hinder the purpose and perfect\r\nunfoldment of all life--we cannot afford to be selfish, sinful or cruel\r\nin our actions toward each other, or toward any other form of cosmic\r\nlife. Having once acquired these convictions, with this most important\r\nfund of information, we possess the key which will unlock the mystery of\r\nthe action and reaction of the potent and unseen forces of nature, which\r\naffect us as individuals, as they do the earth, air and water, the\r\nelements so necessary to our existence. The restless, never-satisfied,\r\nquestioning spirit, born with every human soul, is the expression of a\r\ndivine purpose! To gratify this insatiable desire for more knowledge, is\r\nto comply with the demands of a wise cosmic law. By so doing, we enter\r\ninto the enjoyment of a never-failing source of perpetual delight. We\r\nare crowned with a happiness of the purest type!\r\n\r\n\"In viewing this vast field of knowledge, spread so invitingly before\r\nus; in anticipating the joy we may glean therefrom; we catch a glimpse\r\nof the exceeding richness of the boon of immortality, which, as a\r\nspiritual heritage, is waiting for us. We begin slowly to understand\r\nourselves as the repositories of infinite possibilities!--as cosmic\r\nunits of the larger Cosmos--as a perfect microcosm of the macrocosm!\r\nWith feelings of awe-inspiring adoration, we reflect that we may know\r\nourselves as individuals, only as the extent of our knowledge of the\r\nuniverse around us is increased. Responding to the law of action and\r\nreaction, the more we reflect, the greater becomes our desire to know\r\nmore of ourselves. Always more! Ever more! Never quite satisfied!\r\nFortunately, the immortality of the wisdom loving human soul embraces\r\nall time, and all eternity! Therefore, through the law of eternal\r\nprogression, we may naturally and rightfully aspire to the acquirement\r\nof all possible knowledge. In cultivating these aspirations, we may rest\r\nassured that we shall constantly gain new conceptions and new meanings\r\nfor the word 'Heaven.'\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, my friends and co-workers, my brothers and sisters, let\r\nus congratulate ourselves as the fortunate recipients of this priceless\r\ngift: let us endeavor to show our appreciation by a speedy mastery of\r\nthe contents of these valuable books. Let us approach the work, full of\r\njoyful anticipation and enthusiasm, with the proud consciousness that we\r\nare invited guests to a great feast of learning. Let us strive in every\r\nway to make study thoroughly enjoyable. Let us make it one long holiday\r\nin honor of the Goddess of Wisdom! One grand harvest-home of our\r\ngathering of the golden fruit from the tree of knowledge. Let us be as\r\nearnest as we are enthusiastic--let us be thorough, and withal\r\nmethodical and systematic.\r\n\r\n\"The ten sets of text-books, suggest the formation of the membership of\r\nthe company into that number of scientific clubs; which I recommend.\r\nThis division would give fifty adults as the average membership of each\r\nclub. We have at least ten available rooms large enough to accommodate\r\nclubs of that size. Each club should begin with the primary text-book,\r\nwhich should be read, discussed, analyzed and re-read until clearly\r\nunderstood by the entire class. The club to proceed in the same order\r\nwith the next of the series, until all are thoroughly mastered. I will\r\nvolunteer to join the club to which is assigned that scientific study\r\nwhich may prove the most difficult, least inviting and most unpopular.\r\nBy the force of a united purpose, working co-operatively together, we\r\nshall soon develop a capacity for severe mental labor, which will make\r\nthe mastery of the remainder of the course a constant source of\r\npleasure. What we need in the way of equipment, chemicals, instruments,\r\netc., can be easily and quickly secured.\r\n\r\n\"George and Gertrude Gerrish will have an advisory superintendence over\r\nthe work of all the clubs. Years of experience in teaching have prepared\r\nthem to quickly untangle the mixed quantities or conditions that may\r\nconfront us, and thus skillfully turn our difficulties into delights.\r\n\r\n\"With this general plan for conducting our literary festival, I will\r\nleave the subject with you for consideration at the proper time.\r\n\r\n\"I feel conscious that under the circumstances, I owe you an apology for\r\nhaving so trespassed upon your patience and good nature, by the length\r\nof my remarks. Therefore I desire to acknowledge my thrice doubled\r\nappreciation of your manifest interest, attention and sympathy, which\r\nhave both flattered and encouraged me greatly.\r\n\r\n\"I will now close by thanking you, through your worthy officers, for\r\nthis cordial and beautiful reception; also for the opportunity to\r\naddress you on a subject in which I am so deeply interested.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF POPULAR SCIENCE CLUBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the days passed after the reception, the new books were unpacked by\r\nFillmore Flagg, assisted by George Gerrish. As soon as possible they\r\nwere arranged and placed on appropriate shelves in each one of the ten\r\nrooms prepared for them. Large steel engravings in plain oak frames, of\r\nall the authors, together with the maps and charts, all neatly glazed\r\nand mounted, adorned the walls of the particular room to which they\r\nbelonged, adding greatly to the attractiveness of the general\r\ncollection. As the work progressed, the keen interest displayed by all\r\nmembers of the farm company seemed to increase. They could talk of\r\nnothing else; they were eagerly and almost impatiently waiting for the\r\nannouncement of the formation of the clubs. Accordingly therefore, as\r\nsoon as the rooms were ready, a complete schedule of the books in each\r\nseries was made; these schedules being numbered from one to ten, to\r\nindicate the series to which they belonged. They were printed and\r\ndistributed among the members of the company, with a request that one\r\nweek later, each member should return two of the numbered schedules\r\nmarked as first and second choice of the studies they desired to take\r\nup. By this method of voluntary selection, the clubs were quickly and\r\neasily formed, without friction or embarassment. Well stimulated by an\r\never increasing fund of interest and enthusiastic ambition, the club\r\nmembers, impressed with the wisdom of Fillmore Flagg's advice, promptly\r\ntook up the class work of the study chosen, eager to secure a generous\r\nshare of the educational benefits to be dispensed at the board of this\r\ngreat literary feast, to which they had been so kindly invited as\r\nespecially selected guests. With some misgivings as to the final result,\r\nFillmore Flagg carefully watched the preliminary club work while yet in\r\nits organic stage. He had been somewhat doubtful of the ability of the\r\naverage club member, who was not a trained student, to acquire a\r\nsufficient interest in such abstract subjects, with which to develop the\r\nmental force so necessary in order to digest and finally master them.\r\nHowever, much to his surprise and delight, at the very threshold of the\r\nwork, the display of energy, ability and mental acuteness on the part of\r\nthe entire club membership, dispelled the last remaining doubt from his\r\nmind; he was convinced of the practicability and final success of the\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nIn carefully analyzing the subject, he perceived that they were\r\nquickened by the momentum of a united co-operative effort; also that\r\nthey were--perhaps subconsciously--pushed forward by a great number of\r\nnew ideas concerning the desirability of at once acquiring a larger\r\nstore of scientific lore, as a necessary and more complete equipment for\r\nthe practical duties of the battle of life. Dominant and central among\r\nthese ideas, was the one which so temptingly promised an increased\r\nknowledge of themselves as individuals, by the mastery of the broad and\r\nhitherto unexplored field of explanatory science; which might lead to a\r\nbetter solution of the mystery of environmental conditions. Finally,\r\nthey were no doubt inspired strongly by a firm conviction that, once\r\narmed with a thorough scientific education, they would possess an\r\nadditional power to aid in making Solaris Farm a speedier and more\r\npronounced success.\r\n\r\nFillmore Flagg accepted this demonstration of the combined ability of\r\nthe farm people to conquer the most difficult problems of science,\r\nwithout the advantage of previous training, as an added proof that the\r\nideas and methods of the model farm were most assuredly in conjunctive\r\nharmony with planetary evolution; therefore with the great force of\r\ncombined co-operative mental effort to push it forward, still more\r\nsurprising results might reasonably be expected, when these efforts were\r\nmore wisely and skillfully directed along lines indicated by nature as\r\nlines of the least possible resistance. A realization of these\r\nexpectations would seem to suggest that the key to future success in all\r\neducational work lies in discovering systems, methods, associations and\r\nsurroundings for the students, which are nearest in conjunctive harmony\r\nwith natural evolution, consequently along a pathway presenting the\r\nfewest possible obstacles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nA TWENTIETH CENTURY LOVE LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All the world loves a lover!\" is a trite but beautiful saying, which\r\ntouches a responsive chord in the great heart of humanity! We cannot\r\nremain indifferent to the magnetic effect of the strong tide of his\r\neloquent and impetuous wooing. Nor can we withhold a sympathetic desire\r\nto aid him in reaching the goal of success--to win the precious prize.\r\nQuite as naturally, we are intensely and delightfully interested in the\r\nbirth, the unfoldment, and the blossoming of every individual entity in\r\nthe great ocean of cosmic life. Instinctively we recognize that love is\r\nlife. One could not exist without the other. Old and young alike\r\nunderstand the potency of the spell which binds the lover; which holds\r\nhim for unconscious periods of time, absorbed in dreamy contemplation of\r\nhis ecstatic devotion to the heroic virtues, graces, accomplishments and\r\nattributes of the charming woman, whom his heart has chosen to represent\r\nall things in the universe which have meaning and worth for him. Through\r\nthis adorable woman, the crowned and glorified object of his\r\nall-absorbing love, he can best respond to the rythmic throbbing of all\r\ncosmic life. In this superior state of beautiful transfiguration, he\r\nforgets self, and lives for long happy months in the rare upper strata\r\nof real unselfishness. Under the powerful influence of pure love, the\r\nhighest and holiest emotion which stirs, controls and makes better the\r\nlife of every mortal; lost in the blissful alembic of this great\r\nchemical change, the lover recognizes himself in every demonstration of\r\nuniversal life around him. He also becomes aware, from some inner\r\nconsciousness, of the extent to which the emotional nature controls and\r\nmolds the individual; that among the anabolic emotions, love is the\r\nqueen of the emotional empire; that the touch of her magical scepter is\r\nso potent and penetrating as to render the individual receptive and\r\nresponsive to all of the ennobling, purifying, progressive and exalting\r\nelements of the universe: but, on the other hand, what is still more\r\nmarvelous: that the same touch renders the individual negative to the\r\ninflowing currents from all of the baser elements. With this awareness\r\ncomes the conviction that the Empire of Love is boundless and limitless;\r\nthat it permeates and glorifies the vast ocean of infinity! On the\r\nstrong, swift tide of this shoreless ocean, the lover floats, secure,\r\nserene and confident, on his voyage toward destiny's most distant port.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Fillmore Flagg to Fern Fenwick, will serve in\r\nsome measure to illustrate the power of love to change, expand, energize\r\nand spiritualize the entire character of the lover: to purify and\r\nstrengthen the moral disposition of our hero, to eliminate from it all\r\ntendency to selfishness; to endow him with a broader wisdom, with higher\r\nand nobler aspirations of life; to fit him more perfectly to carry\r\nforward his great work for humanity at Solaris Farm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"My Darling Fern: Noblest, purest and most beautiful of women! Like the\r\nrose to the sunlight, like the needle to the pole, my heart turns in\r\nadoration to you. My own true love! My peerless one! My guiding star in\r\nlove's azure sky! My soul swells and sings with its full tide of joy, as\r\nwilling fingers attempt to put in words the thoughts born of my great\r\nlove for you. What miracle have you wrought for me, my precious one,\r\nthat I am so happy? The earth, the sky, the verdant woods, the grand\r\nmountains, the green meadows, the shady nooks, the babbling brooks;--all\r\nthrill my innermost being with a thousand new charms! The bees, the\r\nbirds, the flowers and trees as they bend or sigh to the passing breeze;\r\nthe solemn stillness of majestic night; the deep blue sea, overarched by\r\nnature's matchless crown of diamonds, a countless multitude of brilliant\r\nstars, in the silvery moonlight of love--how eloquent their song! All\r\nthings in nature speak to me; they bless you for loving me! In the halo\r\nof that blessing, as I think of you, I am transfigured by a newly-born\r\necstacy! To breathe, to exist, is to realize the superlative degree of\r\nmy exquisite happiness! Hidden away from the clouds and storms of life,\r\nby the golden mist which veils the measureless sea of love, infinite\r\nlove, I sail serene and confident upon its heaving tide. Gently rocked\r\nby the lapping lullaby of the rythmical waves of paradise, I fearlessly\r\nfloat. I care not for time nor tide, nor distant port of a future\r\ndestiny! Entranced by the music of love's beautiful sea, I dream love's\r\ndream alone with myself, the outer world shut away--swallowed up by the\r\noverwhelming tide of my sweet and blissful contentment.\r\n\r\n\"From such hours of exaltation, I am sometimes rudely awakened by a\r\nmonster reflex wave of self-examination. Ah, dear heart! It is then that\r\nI ask of my soul: What am I? What have I done? What sweet guardian\r\nspirit guides my life, that I should be made so exceedingly happy by the\r\npriceless love of such a beautiful woman? Am I worthy of such a\r\nblessing? Can I properly appreciate the great good fortune of being\r\nfondly and truly loved by such a peerless woman, who is so dear to me,\r\nso noble, so good, so true; so pure, so bright, so beautiful; so truly\r\nwise, so eloquent; in every way so well fitted by birth, wealth, and\r\neducation to reign as queen in the most brilliant and most exclusive\r\ncircles of the social world; even in the grandly beautiful city of\r\nWashington, where the princes and potentates of the earth, lords of\r\nother lands, of wealth and fashion of high degree, vie with each other\r\nand with the republic's most honored statesmen, for one smile, one look\r\nof recognition from this marvelous woman, who is everywhere recognized\r\nas the dominant center of attraction? Oh, the wonder of it! This is she\r\nwho holds the key to my heart!\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my adored one! As this picture of your life fills my mind, I wonder\r\nwhat would happen to me under such circumstances, with any other woman\r\nin your place. I know I should be both furiously jealous and foolishly\r\ndespondent: but with you, the very apotheosis of truth and\r\nhonesty!--Impossible! It could not be: so base a thought would perish\r\nwith the thinking! I know you are as true as steel. The pure soul which\r\nshines from your eyes has spoken to mine. I am content; I fear not; I\r\nknow that the compass of your love is constancy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! my darling! Chosen one of my soul! How great is the mystery of\r\nlove! How priceless the blessing it brings to the lover! How brilliant\r\nthe constellation, how spiritualizing the multitude of new thoughts to\r\nwhich it gives birth! How I pity those who have not been touched and\r\nquickened by the life-giving power of love! How sad and desolate is the\r\npathway of the soul so unfortunate as to be shut away from the sunshine\r\nof love! Better, far better, to die of love! To die of love is to live\r\nby it! It is to have discovered the great deeps of the infinite: for\r\nlove itself is a revelation of the infinite! The aspiration of love is\r\nthe inspiration of paradise. Who can understand the significance, or the\r\ngreat mystery of immortality, or the fulness of the promise of eternal\r\nhappiness to be gained by a life of endless progression, without first\r\nhaving lived a life of love? The smile of love is the rainbow of life!\r\nEvery tender emotion of love is a prayer, pure and potent, for a higher\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"The truth of these things, my sweet heart, I realize more fully each\r\nday. I feel and know that every link in the chain of eternal existence,\r\nis a link of love! My love for you has been for me a spiritual blessing\r\nindeed! It has opened the eyes of my soul, so that I may perceive the\r\nsignificance of the miracle of love, which must precede the miracle of\r\nbirth, as the necessary beginning of the unfoldment of the individual up\r\nto his highest estate--the repository of infinite possibilities. Love,\r\nthen, my dear one, is the highest and holiest attribute of the human\r\nsoul: that inspiring, controlling force, which wings the soul to such\r\nsublime spiritual heights, as are far above and beyond the storms of\r\ncommon passions, and the evil influences of the baser emotions.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! sweetheart of mine! How much do I owe to the uplifting power of\r\nlove! I question and wonder! When its divine radiance shines upon me,\r\nthrough the glory of your beautiful eyes, I am led up the steep\r\nacclivities of the mountain of wisdom by a new pathway. I perceive that\r\nas the oracle of life, love is the potency which crowns woman with that\r\nentrancing aura of soft, sweet, melting force, which for ages has\r\nproclaimed her the greatest and most fascinating mystery of the\r\nuniverse! I also perceive that, responding to the stimulant of this\r\npotential aura, I am thrilled, spiritualized, energized, encouraged and\r\nmore perfectly fitted to perform whatever difficult or heroic work the\r\nneeds of our farm people may demand. Fortunate for me was the day when\r\nFennimore Fenwick left you heir to his plans for redeeming the lives of\r\nthese people! Fortunate indeed, was the time when I was chosen by you to\r\ndiscover, select and institute Solaris Farm, with the broad humanitarian\r\nwork which its success represents. Each memory of this farm; of my every\r\nthought, plan or deed for its improvement: of its people; of their\r\nlives, health, and happiness; of their sublime confidence in me, of the\r\nprompt obedience they so cheerfully render to my slightest command; of\r\nthe peculiar pride expressed by the appreciation of their importance as\r\nworking units of the farm, all united, harmoniously blended, in one\r\nperfected co-operative mass;--is a memory made more delightfully\r\npermanent by the wonderful light of your love!\r\n\r\n\"Never before have I been so busy or so blessed! Every emotion of pride,\r\nenthusiasm, ambition, joy or love, which stirs the hearts and quickens\r\nthe pulse of these people, who are working with me for one object so\r\nfaithfully, so earnestly; through the magnetic halo of your love, is\r\nreflected upon me with redoubled intensity. In the strong current of\r\nthis electrical stream of power, I am quickened, strengthened and\r\nprepared to do better thinking and more effective work for the perfect\r\ndevelopment of the farm.\r\n\r\n\"At this point, dear Fern, I must mention an item of farm news, in which\r\nI am sure you will be greatly interested. We have arranged to have our\r\narbor-day celebration, or tree planting festival, on the 10th day of the\r\nmonth of March in each year, as the season, in this climate most\r\nsuitable for the work. For some months past, for the purpose of exciting\r\nin the minds of our people a keener interest, I have been giving a\r\ncourse of lectures on the general subject of forestry. These lectures\r\nhave proved so attractive, that as a result, they have been\r\nexceptionally well attended by both old and young. The amount of\r\ninterest displayed by my hearers, is a continual source of surprise and\r\ndelight to me. Early in the course, this extraordinary interest\r\nculminated in such a perfect shower of questions in regard to the\r\ndetails of the subject, that I was obliged to refer my questioners to\r\nthe various books written on the subject, as most completely and\r\nsatisfactorily answering the multitude of their queries. As a\r\nconsequence, the botany club has had a great boom. While every book in\r\nthe library on forestry, or the care and culture of plants and trees,\r\nincluding those in a full series of annual reports from the Department\r\nof Agriculture, is in constant use. You would be delighted, my dearest,\r\ncould you note the readiness of even the children to grasp the idea, to\r\nunderstand the immensity of the benefits which may be conferred on\r\nfuture generations by our systematically directed efforts in tree\r\nplanting here on this farm. Both young and old alike, are quick to\r\nappreciate the important fact that while we are enjoying a holiday, to\r\nwhich we may look forward each year with increasing delight; we are at\r\nthe same time furnishing the world with an object lesson as to the\r\npracticability and great value of the good work which may be\r\naccomplished by all classes of agricultural people, in the general\r\nobservance of such a festival.\r\n\r\n\"The announcement of the good news that you are to visit the farm in\r\ntime to attend our first arbor day celebration, on the tenth of next\r\nmonth, has made our people very happy. They are simply wild with delight\r\nat the prospect of seeing you so soon: of having an opportunity to thank\r\nyou in person for the many favors you have so generously bestowed upon\r\nthem. Hitherto they have admired and adored the beautiful and generous\r\nyoung patroness of Solaris Farm, through the medium of a life-size\r\ncrayon portrait, made some months ago, from one of your recent\r\nphotographs. Since then, this lovely shadow of the idol of my heart,\r\nadorned by a suitable frame, has occupied the post of honor, as the\r\nonly picture on the walls of the library. The advent of such a charming\r\npicture, at once converted the library into the throne room of the\r\nvillage, where gathered daily, admiring throngs of our people to feast\r\ntheir eyes in silent worship at the shrine of this life-like shadow of\r\nyour lovely face. In thus exposing this picture, so dear, so sacred to\r\nme, to the earnest and respectful admiration of our people without your\r\nknowledge or consent; I trust, Dear Heart, that I may not have outraged\r\nyour sense of propriety in the slightest degree. It occurred to me that\r\nit would be just and right, also most fitting and proper that, as the\r\npatroness of the farm, your portrait should appear in the place it now\r\noccupies; that it would be the most appropriate method of linking your\r\nindividuality, in the minds of our people, with the peculiar work and\r\ndestiny of the farm. If you consider my action from this point of view,\r\nI am sure you will approve. Like some good fairy, the silent charm of\r\nyour portrait has each day, each hour, wrought its perfect work in my\r\nlife and in the lives of our people. It has proved a constant source of\r\ndelight! An added talisman to insure the final success of our\r\nenterprise!\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my good angel! my Princess Charming! At last comes the crowning\r\nthought which completes my wreath of happiness! It comes to me daily,\r\nagain and again! It is this, Dear Heart; that every step toward the\r\nfinal and complete success of Solaris Farm, is an added link in the\r\nchain of a shining destiny which shall bind our lives more firmly\r\ntogether, until at last this beautiful chain of love shall have become\r\nproof against the dissolving power of the passing ages of an Eternity!\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, sweetheart, may a bright band of faithful guardian\r\nspirits, ever watchful, ever near, guide and guard you, the crowning\r\ntreasure of my life, is the earnest prayer of\r\n\r\n            \"Your devoted, loving and loyal,\r\n\r\n                        \"FILLMORE FLAGG.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE REPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MY DARLING FILLMORE: Words fail to express the happy effect of the\r\npleasing emotions that arise as I muse and dream, build castles in the\r\nair and indulge myself, again and again, in the luxury of reading line\r\nby line, the glowing tributes of love in your marvelous letter. I am\r\nelectrified by its wonderful logic, rythm and melody. Ah, my chosen one!\r\nSo manly; so noble; so true! The witchery of your eloquence is a\r\nconquering force, that Cupid with his bow might well be proud of! My\r\nheart rejoices under the influence of its magical spell! I am so happy\r\nand so proud of you! The great deeps of my emotional nature have\r\nresponded to the poetical sublimity of your charmingly expressed\r\nsentiments. They thrill my soul like the dawn of some glorious summer\r\nday; like the exquisite perfume of a sweet flower; like that sublimely\r\nsweet surprise which steals over the senses, while a fleecy veil of\r\nsilvery mist, responding to the power of the advancing king of day,\r\nslowly rises and discloses the shoreless grandeur of that tidal mystery,\r\nthe majestic, restless, billowy bosom of Old Ocean; like some grand\r\nsymphony of masterful music, penetrating and resonant, with that\r\nmysterious potency which awakens every echo of the soul's musical\r\npossibilities! Yet, sweetheart, every word is charged with your personal\r\nmagnetism; is stamped with your individuality; freighted with the wealth\r\nof your spiritual and intellectual development. In every line, sentence\r\nand paragraph, I recognize you as my ideal of a lover, the dearest and\r\nmost noble of men!\r\n\r\n\"In my retrospective moods, the cloud of memories, born of the incidents\r\nwhich have marked our past acquaintance, form a telescopic vista.\r\nThrough this vista, examined in the crucible of much correspondence, the\r\nintimate association and the mutual friendship of many months duration,\r\nI perceive that I have discovered and have learned to appreciate the\r\nsterling worth of your character. Through this avenue I become conscious\r\nthat you represent to me the superior nobility of true American genius;\r\nthe highest and grandest type of manhood! Idealized as my hero, I place\r\nyou in the front rank of America's dominant thinkers; a peer among\r\npeers, both potential and progressive--yet withal so modest, so free\r\nfrom dogmatism.\r\n\r\n\"I seem to feel intuitively that you are standing at the very beginning\r\nof a new cycle in the history of our planet: a cycle in which symmetry\r\nof mind and power of brain, fix the standard by which nature selects the\r\nleaders she deems most worthy of ruling the destinies of her people. I\r\nfeel that you have been measured by such a standard, and chosen as the\r\ninstrument for the accomplishment of a special work of the utmost\r\nimportance!\r\n\r\n\"This bit of hero-worship on my part is due, no doubt, to the intensity\r\nof my devotion to our Republic; to the earnestness of my convictions in\r\nregard to its manifest destiny as a saving power--an uplifting\r\nforce--among the nations of the earth. These growing convictions are\r\nemphasized by the keener perceptions of my spiritual nature, which\r\ndeclare that this almost resistless force which dominates our Republic,\r\nthat may be likened to the world's storage battery, is due to the\r\nprogressive power gained by the universal enlightenment of the American\r\npeople as a mass. This important thought seems to emphasize the wisdom\r\nand the importance of universal education.\r\n\r\n\"I must now refer to a matter mentioned in your letter, in which I am\r\nparticularly interested. In declining to become jealous of the bevy of\r\ntitled lords, who pay fawning court to my wealth and social position,\r\nhere in Washington, you do yourself justice; while at the same time, you\r\npay me the compliment of a lifetime! When compared with you, how puny\r\nand feeble are the princes and titled lords, made by kings and courts,\r\nin lands where selfishness reigns supreme at the expense of millions of\r\nunfortunate subjects! An impecunious host of these fortune-hunting lords\r\nswarm in the society of our large cities. With faded titles of doubtful\r\nvalue, as their only stock in trade, they fittingly represent the\r\ndecaying nobility of passing monarchies. They are looking for victims!\r\nThey become the highly honored guests of selfish, title-crazy,\r\nmatch-making mothers! Oh the pity of it! Oh the shame of it! How\r\nAmerican girls, who are born to wealth, with all of the advantages which\r\nwealth may command, including the best education possible in this land\r\nof progressive liberty; who should love devotedly the vital principles\r\nof our democracy;--can be so dazzled by the false glitter of a title,\r\nthat they deliberately choose to mate themselves (and their riches,)\r\nwith such sorry specimens of lordliness; such brainless, nerveless\r\nbundles of selfishness, is something too monstrous for my comprehension!\r\n\r\n\"Are these girls really Americans at heart? Do they represent the women\r\nof our land? Can they understand or appreciate the privilege as a\r\nbirthright, of proudly taking an honored part in the coming motherhood\r\nof this great and progressive land of republican liberty; a republic\r\nwhich to day stands as the hope of the world? Is it possible that they\r\ncan knowingly wish to become mothers of a feeble race of puny\r\nchildren--children who are cruelly bereft of moral, physical and\r\nintellectual vigor by the tainted heritage which, like some avenging\r\nnemesis, through the action of an inexorable law, surely follows the\r\nunfortunate offspring of lordling fathers, who are born as the very\r\ndregs from twenty generations of the vice and depravity of kingly\r\ncourts?\r\n\r\n\"My dear Fillmore, to these interrogatories I answer, No! A thousand\r\ntimes No! Ignorance! A shameful ignorance of the true object and purpose\r\nof human life, on the part of these misguided girls, is their only sin.\r\nThey are well-nigh hopelessly ignorant of the significance, or even the\r\nexistence, of the great basic truths of evolutionary life. They know not\r\nthat each age in the series of evolution grows out of the preceding one;\r\nthat each in its order is the parent of the next; that the same is true\r\nof each generation of people. In the midnight darkness of their\r\nignorance, they are incapable of knowing that virtue inherently\r\npossesses the germ of perpetuity. They can neither understand nor heed\r\nthe warning cry of history, which proves that crime and depravity have\r\nin themselves the seeds of natural death. They have never read\r\nhistory's tragic story of the total extinction of the royal houses of\r\nCapet, Valois, Tudor, Stuart and Bourbon;--a story which demonstrates so\r\nconclusively the avenging results that follow the crimes of royal\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\n\"To redeem these girls from such dense ignorance; to rescue them from\r\nthe thralldom of such a fashionable sin, which threatens to become a\r\nfad; to open their eyes to the horrible consequences which follow such\r\nmisalliances, is a work so important as to demand the immediate\r\nattention and united effort of a host of America's patriot mothers.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, dear Fillmore, for devoting so much space in my letter to\r\nthis particular topic. I feel sure you will kindly excuse any excess of\r\nfervor which may have marked the expression of my indignation. Because\r\nyou so well understand the intensity of my devotion to the broadly\r\nprogressive principles of our matchless republic, you may, consequently,\r\nguess the full measure of my scorn for this foolish, title-hunting class\r\nof creatures who, like silly moths, blindly sacrifice themselves in\r\nfolly's funereal flame. The bare idea of marriage to gain a foreign\r\ntitle has always been exceedingly repugnant to me. With passing years, I\r\nam each day more thankful that since my early childhood there has been\r\nburied deep in my heart, a determination that when the time came for me\r\nto select a husband, the only title of the one chosen should be the\r\nstamp of honor which marked him as a true type of an American citizen--a\r\nreal American genius; a truly noble soul, perfectly and beautifully\r\nexpressed by a harmonious combination of physical and intellectual\r\ndevelopment!\r\n\r\n\"Fortunate the day for me when that lucky advertisement brought you to\r\nmy side, as a trusty, capable co-worker, whom I have learned to\r\nrespect, to admire and to love. My dreams have been realized. I have\r\nfound my ideal. You may fearlessly trust in the absolute truth of your\r\nassertion that 'the compass of my love is constancy!'\r\n\r\n\"Now my hero! My ideal of a gallant Knight of Most Excellent\r\nAgriculture, whose nodding plumes, of tassels of corn, artistically\r\ninterwoven with splendid pompons of waving wheat, barley, oats and rye\r\nhave so dazzled my eyes and charmed my heart; having chanted my song of\r\nlove, I hasten to assure you that your last report concerning the\r\nadministration of the affairs of the farm, has pleased me greatly. I\r\nthink the progress achieved in so short a time, is truly marvelous! Only\r\nmy Fillmore could have accomplished so much! I am full of curiosity\r\nabout the details. When I come, you must be prepared to answer a host of\r\nquestions; to go with me on many excursions of discovery before I shall\r\nhave completed my tour of agricultural investigation.\r\n\r\n\"I approve of the disposition you have made of my portrait. Of course my\r\npersonal pride is gratified by the sincere admiration and praise it has\r\nexcited. I am happy in the knowledge that it has proved so efficacious\r\nas a talisman of good fortune for the farm. I think I understand your\r\nreasons for the feeling that my individuality should be in some way\r\ndirectly interwoven with the destiny of the farm.\r\n\r\n\"Reasoning from the peculiar environments which so affect our lives, I\r\nrealize more fully each day that my personal interest in every step\r\ntoward its final success, must necessarily be quite equal to your own.\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted with the idea of being present at your first Arbor day\r\ncelebration. I hope there is to be in the order of exercises an oration\r\nwhich you are to deliver. If so, I know you will not disappoint me! I\r\nam prepared to prophesy that you will do yourself justice, do credit to\r\nSolaris and at the same time you will cover the subject with a halo of\r\nglory. Such a result seems assured when I consider the extraordinary\r\ninterest which was aroused by your lectures on forestry. This signal\r\nconquest of your eloquence has gratified my pride very much. I am\r\nstrongly impressed with the vast importance of this tree-planting\r\nschool, which you are about to institute at Solaris. The success which\r\nyou have won in the preliminary work is so promising, that I am sure you\r\nhave undertaken a task which is worthy of your genius. In my judgment,\r\nyou have already demonstrated your ability to accomplish many wonderful\r\nthings. Great opportunities are before you. By the force of your logic,\r\nby the earnestness of your eloquence, you will be able to instill and to\r\npermanently fix in the minds of our people--both parents and\r\nchildren--the true progressive principles of American citizenship. You\r\nwill thus enable them to perceive the serious import of the\r\nresponsibilities which, like a mantle of power, descends upon them, as\r\nthe representative working units of this great republic. You can so\r\ninspire them that they will be eager and proud to take up with honor the\r\nburden of these responsibilities. You can so change and elevate the\r\nlives of these people and a multitude of others, that first they shall\r\nbecome masters of themselves; later, masters of the republic; through\r\nthe controlling force, the imperial dominancy of scientifically\r\ndeveloped, symmetrical minds; whose intellectual, ethical,\r\ninspirational, logical and constructive power, combined as an elevating\r\nagency, shall raise the republic of the future to still more commanding\r\nheights. To accomplish these things, is the glorious beginning of a\r\ngreat career! In visions of your life work, it comes to me that this\r\npreparatory work on the farm is but the introduction to a more important\r\nmission, in the vastly wider field of a near future. In this coming work\r\nwe shall stand side by side. Hand in hand, with hearts united by the\r\nbonds of a supreme love, we shall go forth armed with the power to\r\novercome and to conquer the great hosts of ignorance and selfishness\r\nwhich so hinder the world's progress.\r\n\r\n\"Really, my true love, although this letter is so long, I cannot close\r\nit without again expressing my appreciation of your soul-satisfying\r\nletter; so laden with the fragrance, the benediction of your love; so\r\npotent with the charm of happiness for me. To its benign influence my\r\nheart responds by the awakening of the highest and best emotions of my\r\nspiritual nature. Written in clear, plain English, it appeals to me as a\r\nletter of such sterling intelligence as only my ideal of a lover could\r\nwrite. How different it is from the soft, sweet nonsense of fashionable\r\nfops; the effusive gush of poetical dudes.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I must say to you Good bye, my sweetheart! Remember that waking or\r\ndreaming, I love you truly. Only you, so dear to me--you, so generous,\r\nso noble, so good. Bright are the links of love's golden chain which\r\ntime cannot sever. Constancy, our love shall bless, now and forever. May\r\nthe sweet guardian spirits who guide your footsteps, keep you safely\r\nuntil we meet again, is the ever-present thought which is inspired by\r\nlove's whisper in the heart of your devoted,\r\n\r\n\"FERN FENWICK.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nFERN FENWICK ARRIVES AT SOLARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFern Fenwick, accompanied by Mrs. Bainbridge, arrived at Solaris on the\r\nafternoon of the third day previous to the tree-planting festival. When\r\nthe train reached the station, they were met by Fillmore Flagg\r\naccompanied by George and Gertrude Gerrish, the committee representing\r\nthe farm company. With this escort to the village, they were soon\r\ninstalled in a handsome suite of rooms, beautifully decorated and\r\nfurnished for their reception.\r\n\r\nAfter a late luncheon, Fern Fenwick gave a private interview to Fillmore\r\nFlagg. During this interview, which lasted more than two hours, matters\r\nboth of business and of love were discussed: love, however, claimed the\r\nlion's share of the time. Very soon, by mutual consent, the major part\r\nof the business was postponed until after the tour of the farm, planned\r\nfor the following day, had been completed. Then with a sigh of relief,\r\nthey resigned themselves to the sway of that potent charm of blending\r\nmagnetic and spiritual auras, which so swiftly transports reunited\r\nlovers to a paradise of their own.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with previous plans, the next day was spent by the\r\nvisitors in driving about the farm. The first motor carriage was\r\noccupied by Mrs. Bainbridge accompanied by George and Gertrude Gerrish,\r\nFillmore Flagg and Fern Fenwick following in another. Pursuing a\r\ncarefully arranged program, all points of interest were visited; the\r\nbarns and stables, herds and flocks, the meadows, the cotton and grain\r\nfields, poultry yards, dairy, apiary, gardens, mills, store-houses,\r\npacking-houses, factory buildings, the brick works and pottery, the\r\nclay-beds, stone-quarries, coal and other mines.\r\n\r\nThis tour of inspection, which occupied nearly the whole day, proved\r\nvery interesting to Fern Fenwick. With her note-book in hand, and her\r\nkeen eyes on the alert to catch every salient point, she kept our hero\r\nbusy answering a host of questions. It was a long, happy day for him! To\r\nsit so near her, to look into her smiling eyes, to listen to the musical\r\ntones of her voice, to answer her swiftly spoken questions, to respond\r\nto the pressure of her gloved hand upon his arm as she directed his\r\nattention to some particular object; all seemed to him such a delicious\r\nbit of experience, that he almost wished it might go on forever!\r\n\r\nIn the evening the reception given in honor of the Patroness of the\r\nfarm, was held in the large hall of education and amusement. In this\r\nhall, which was handsomely decorated for the event, the people of\r\nSolaris were assembled. They were a unit in eagerness to give expression\r\nto demonstrations of delight when, for the first time, they were\r\npermitted to greet the one they wished to honor: a woman whose name they\r\nreverenced as the title of the noblest guest they could ever hope to\r\nentertain. George and Gertrude Gerrish, with Mrs. Bainbridge, were\r\nalready seated on the stage, when Fillmore Flagg appeared, escorting\r\nFern Fenwick from the waiting room. Moved by one dominant impulse, the\r\nentire audience arose to receive her. The repeated cheers of welcome\r\nwere intensified by the accompaniment of a fleecy cloud of waving\r\nhandkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nOur heroine was well worthy the ovation: richly and artistically gowned,\r\nshe was a perfect picture of loveliness! Her cheeks flushed with the\r\nexcitement of such an unexpected demonstration, her beautiful eyes\r\nflashing with the inspiration of her wonderful enthusiasm, her perfect\r\nfigure proudly erect with the grace and dignity of an all-conquering\r\nmagnetic presence, she captured the hearts of the people even before she\r\nhad opened her lovely lips to address them.\r\n\r\nWarned by a gesture from Fillmore, the cheering ceased and the audience\r\nbecame seated. He then introduced Fern Fenwick by a neat little speech\r\nwhich provoked another storm of applause more demonstrative than the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nWhen order was again restored, at a signal from George Gerrish the\r\ndouble quartet of mixed voices, which had been selected from the singers\r\nof the musical club, came forward and, in a style which reflected much\r\ncredit on the club, gave a song of welcome composed for this particular\r\nreception, and entitled; \"She comes, she comes, she comes to us; our\r\nwise and lovely patroness.\" This song, which created a real sensation,\r\nwas followed by an eloquent address of welcome delivered by George\r\nGerrish in his official capacity, as president of the company. His\r\nremarks were seconded and emphasized most vigorously by long continued\r\ndemonstrations of approval from the assembled members.\r\n\r\nIn response, Fern Fenwick replied at some length in her most charming\r\nmanner. Turning to George Gerrish, she said:\r\n\r\n\"To you, the president, and through you, to the officers, members and\r\nchildren of the company here assembled, I offer my sincere thanks for\r\nthe honor conferred, and for the pleasure given to me by this delightful\r\nreception. The sentiments of kindly greeting, of keen appreciation, of\r\nadmiring approval, so beautifully expressed in your address of welcome,\r\nhave touched me deeply. I am so profoundly moved, that my heart\r\noverflows with grateful emotions! Equally charming, and even more\r\ngracious to me were the words and music of the song which your sweet\r\nsingers have rendered so artistically. These testimonials have so\r\nwonderfully impressed me that I can not forget them! As the years come\r\nand go, I shall cherish the bright memories of this eventful evening, as\r\nadded jewels with which to mark and adorn the shining links, interwoven\r\nwith the chain of my experience in life. These memories shall also serve\r\nto strengthen my already intense interest in this most extraordinary\r\nfarm. A farm with such a wide range of improvements; with such an\r\nimposing collection of large well constructed buildings; with so many\r\nprofitable allied industries in the full tide of successful operation;\r\nwith a general equipment so magnificent, that at every turn I am\r\nastonished and delighted. I now understand why and how you have\r\nsucceeded in transforming the hated drudgery of farm labor into such a\r\npleasant, desirable occupation.\r\n\r\n\"Since the beginning of the enterprise, my interest in the work has been\r\nconstantly stimulated by the detailed accounts contained in the full\r\nweekly reports furnished by your general manager. These reports from\r\ntime to time, I have studied carefully. Therefore I came here expecting\r\nmuch. However, after my tour of inspection, I hasten to assure you, that\r\nI was not all prepared to find such an ideal farm, already in successful\r\noperation! A farm with proportions so generous, an equipment so\r\ncomplete, and a future so promising; that when I pause to contemplate\r\nthe magical changes wrought upon it in the brief space of thirty\r\nmonths, I am filled with admiration for its wonder-working, epoch-making\r\npeople! I consider it a coveted honor to be known as the patroness of\r\nsuch a grand institution. People of Solaris, I am happy to be thus\r\nidentified with you. I am proud of you and your work! A work which shall\r\nyet cause millions to rejoice! You cannot guess; no one can even\r\nestimate, the exceeding value of this work as a shining example of what\r\nproperly organized labor can accomplish. You have succeeded far beyond\r\nmy expectations! Do not waver or turn aside for one moment! Go forward\r\nbravely; be strong and steadfast; be encouraged with the assurance that\r\nall times, I am ready and willing to assist you in every possible way!\r\nSuccess with her golden crown waits to reward you! All the world is\r\nwatching and waiting for the victory, which you have already won.\r\nTherefore, in the name of humanity, I am justified here and now, in\r\nthanking you for this superb lesson in unselfish co-operation. This\r\nlesson in self evolution, which you have given to the world, is a result\r\non your part as individuals, of a wise exercise of mutual trust and\r\nconfidence in each other; reinforced by the combined industry, zeal,\r\npersistence and skill displayed in your noble efforts. By such efforts\r\nyou have made the name of Solaris justly famous throughout the length\r\nand breadth of this Republic!\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, and friends, allow me to again express my\r\nthanks for your greetings of welcome, and for every demonstration of\r\nloving appreciation which you have so generously showered upon me.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the hall still rang with the plaudits of a delighted people;\r\nbefore Fern Fenwick could move towards her seat, George and Gertrude\r\nGerrish and Fillmore Flagg all hastened to her side, to offer\r\ncongratulations on the eloquence and excellence of her impromptu\r\naddress. To the observer, it was plainly evident that the effect of such\r\na stirring speech on the assembled co-operators was unusually\r\nimpressive. They seemed to be inspired with a deeper reverence and a\r\nmore perfect loyalty of devotion for this remarkable woman, who had so\r\ncharmed them by the power of her eloquence. Swayed by the intensity of\r\nthis deep feeling which could not well express itself in noisy cheering;\r\nthey eagerly pressed forward in a quiet orderly way toward the stage,\r\nwhere George Gerrish was waiting to introduce them individually to our\r\nheroine, the patroness of the farm. Smiling graciously as they\r\napproached and were presented, she took each one by the hand in such an\r\nearnest cordial manner, that all feelings of shyness or embarassment\r\nwere quickly banished. After the exchange of a few words of pleasant\r\ngreeting, they quietly returned to their seats. As the reception\r\nprogressed, many of the members improved the brief moments in expressing\r\ntheir grateful appreciation, for the words of praise which she had so\r\nenthusiastically bestowed upon them, in a speech they could never\r\nforget.\r\n\r\nWhen all were again seated, George Gerrish announced that the program\r\nfor the evening would close with three short selections, to be given by\r\nvolunteer members from the ranks of the musical and dramatic clubs. With\r\nthis part of the entertainment finished, before the people could be\r\ndismissed, Fern Fenwick arose to bid them good night, and to thank them\r\nfor such a charming reception, which she pronounced \"simply delightful!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE FESTIVAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately for the tree-planters, the day of the celebration at\r\nSolaris, proved exceptionally fine! No one could resist the exhilarating\r\ntonic of such a perfect day! A day made more glorious by a cloudless\r\nexpanse of blue sky, a flood of golden sunlight, and breezes, soft as\r\nthe balmy breath of gentle spring could make them!\r\n\r\nThe tools and the potted trees, each labeled with the name of the\r\nplanter, were hauled in wagons from the nursery to the site of the\r\nfuture forest, where the ground had already been prepared to receive\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock in the morning the band in the public square began to\r\nplay, as the signal for the people to assemble. At ten the procession\r\nwas formed, ready to march to the planting grounds. First: the band\r\nunder the leadership of Gilbert Gerrish. Second: the children in\r\nalternating fours of boys and girls. Third: the adults in the same\r\norder; followed by the carriages with the President, the Patroness, Mrs.\r\nBainbridge, Fillmore Flagg and Gertrude Gerrish.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the grounds, the procession was massed into a square of\r\nclose columns. The ranks were divided into planting classes of twenty,\r\nwith an instructor for each class. After the classification, the double\r\nquartet of mixed voices, sang a hymn to the forest; the assembly joining\r\nin the chorus. As the square broke up, the members of each class,\r\ncarrying tools and plants, followed the teacher to the particular\r\nplanting grounds prepared for them. At a given signal, three blasts from\r\nthe bugle, the work began, and went merrily forward, with much vigor and\r\na vast deal of lively chatter. In just twenty minutes, the planting was\r\nfinished and the square reformed. The children altogether as a chorus,\r\nthen gave \"An Ode to Growing Trees,\" which they rendered so sweetly and\r\nso effectively, that they earned a great deal of well deserved praise.\r\nThe order for the return march was sounded--the procession quickly\r\nre-formed and returned to the village in the same order in which it\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nA twenty-minute band-concert, given in the large dancing pavillion in\r\nthe center of the public square, came next, and closed the order of\r\nexercises for the forenoon.\r\n\r\nAn intermission until one o'clock was declared.\r\n\r\nPromptly at one o'clock the people were again assembled in the great\r\nhall of education and amusement, to hear the oration. The hall itself\r\nwas handsomely decorated for the occasion, with a profusion of flags and\r\nribbons. The roomy platform was transformed into a garden of verdure, by\r\na brilliant array of ferns, flowers, palms, potted plants and young\r\ntrees. Seated near the center of the platform were Fern Fenwick, Mrs.\r\nBainbridge, Gertrude Gerrish, Fillmore Flagg and George Gerrish. The\r\nlatter, as the president of the farm company, in a few well chosen\r\nwords, introduced General Manager Flagg, as the orator of the day.\r\n\r\nInspired by the cheers which greeted him, happy in the presence of his\r\nbeloved Fern; yet with all alert, and confident of his complete mastery\r\nof the subject; our hero never before seemed quite so handsome as when\r\nhe began to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"People of Solaris, I thank you for the honor of having been chosen as\r\nthe orator, for this our first Arbor-day Celebration! I assure you, that\r\nI am both proud and happy to serve you in that capacity!\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning, let us consider the art of tree-planting, from the\r\nstand-point of an acorn, as being a typical nut or tree-bearing seed,\r\nsuch as I now hold in my hand.\r\n\r\n\"This tiny nut, with such a smooth hard shell of polished brown,\r\ncontains a kernel with magical possibilities. Within this kernel,\r\nclosely packed and safely cradled, lies the embryo oak. So small and so\r\ninsignificant is this nut, that one may travel for months over land and\r\nsea, with the possible ancestor of a half-dozen future oak-forests\r\nsnugly tucked away in some inside pocket. This, too, without ever once\r\nreceiving a demand from the lynx-eyed custom officials, for the payment\r\nof either import or export duties upon it. Half way round the globe,\r\nfrom the spot occupied by its parent tree, this highly-polished,\r\nmuch-traveled nut, if given the proper conditions, will at once commence\r\nthe mysterious transformation process, which marks the beginning of the\r\nlife and growth of another oak tree. This growth, under favorable\r\ncircumstances, may continue for the historical period of ten centuries.\r\nMinistering meanwhile, to the needs of forty passing generations of\r\npeople. Reproducing itself, perhaps a million times in the aggregate, by\r\nthe enormous annual crops of acorns it may have borne. What a history of\r\nmarvels, is the history of such a growth! As it is with the oak, so it\r\nis in a large measure, with all other trees which are produced from\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\n\"This fascinatingly mysterious process of passing from seed to\r\nplant,--from passive to active life, we have watched with keen interest\r\nand growing pleasure, as from week to week, in the seed beds and nursery\r\nrows of our tree-garden, it has steadily progressed, under the varying\r\nconditions of sunshine and storm. Having reached a suitable size for\r\ntransplanting, we have this morning commenced the actual work of tree\r\nplanting, by carefully placing the young trees in the proper soil and\r\nlocation, where they may complete the sturdy growth they have so well\r\nbegun. The preparatory work, we began some months ago, when as\r\nindividuals, we selected the three trees, of some one chosen variety,\r\nwhich we especially desired to plant in forest formation, on the\r\noccasion of this festival.\r\n\r\n\"By the months of thoughtful care and attention which we have given to\r\nthese trees, we have gained a personal interest in them which we cannot\r\nlose. In this initiative work, I am convinced that we have wisely\r\nestablished such a broad foundation of general interest in forestry and\r\nkindred topics, that sooner or later, it will lead us to a complete\r\nmastery of the whole subject. The individual interest thus established,\r\nwill continue to expand until it embraces the entire tree-family of the\r\nworld. By constantly adding to our stores of knowledge in this\r\ndirection, we shall be surprised to find how much we have extended our\r\nfield of pleasure. In the same ratio, there will come to us a\r\ncorresponding increase of affection and appreciation for our\r\nbenefactors, the trees; a solace in the sojourn of life, so generously\r\nsupplied by Mother Nature.\r\n\r\n\"The location of Solaris as an experimental tree-planting farm, is\r\nparticularly fortunate. It possesses a soil and climate which will\r\npromote the perfect growth of more than one hundred different varieties\r\nof trees. Among these, we find a majority of the valuable timber and\r\nnut-bearing trees of the world. Consequently, a very wide field of\r\nexperimentation awaits our efforts. Let us improve our splendid\r\nopportunities so industriously, that a wide spread interest in forestry,\r\nmay follow and become firmly established in the minds of the people of\r\nour Republic.\r\n\r\n\"By way of an introduction to the general subject, of the importance of\r\ntrees, as an adjunct to the progress, welfare and civilization of\r\nmankind. I wish to relate to you the story of my first great lesson in\r\nthe seductive lore of forestry.\r\n\r\n\"Near the beginning of the last decade of the Nineteenth Century, in the\r\nyear of 1893, it was my good fortune to visit the World's Columbian\r\nExposition at Chicago. I was then a lad of fifteen years, full of boyish\r\nenthusiasm, in the enjoyment of my first vacation from the preparatory\r\nschool, where I was being fitted for my collegiate course.\r\n\r\n\"I was born and reared on my father's farm, on the broad rolling\r\nprairies of Nebraska; up to that time I had never been far from home; as\r\na consequence my knowledge of growing trees was limited to the following\r\nfast-growing varieties, which were planted and cultivated by prairie\r\nfarmers for fuel, fencing and storm-protection. I will name these\r\nvarieties in the order of their value for fuel and timber. White ash,\r\nsoft maple, cottonwood and white willow. At a later period I learned\r\nthat perhaps with the exception of white ash, the timber furnished by\r\nthese trees, is considered valueless, in the markets of the world.\r\n\r\n\"Under such circumstances you may imagine my astonishment when I first\r\nbeheld that wonderfully unique, Forestry Building; with its bristling\r\narray of tree-trunk flag poles. Try first to picture in your mind's eye,\r\na building in the form of a parallelogram, large enough to afford two\r\nacres of floor-space; with the first story surrounded on every side by a\r\nwide, open veranda: with a full length second story one hundred feet\r\nwide, rising gracefully from the central roof of the first; altogether,\r\ncompleting a design of exterior so boldly rustic in its general effect,\r\nas to suggest the idea of trees and forests at every point; then, you\r\nmay get the delightfully novel effect, which the architect conveyed to\r\nmy mind as I approached this curiously fascinating structure. A closer\r\ninspection increased the rustic effect of the general design. The main\r\noutside walls, were composed of thousands of wide, bark-coated slabs,\r\ncut from the choice typical trees of our American forests.\r\n\r\n\"The wide roof, was in itself an ideal creation; it was thickly covered\r\nwith curving tiles of rough bark, in alternating layers of the varying\r\nkinds, which formed a picturesque combination redolent with the spicy\r\nresinous odors of birch, basswood, hemlock and fir.\r\n\r\n\"Completely encircling the building, with feet firmly planted on its\r\nsolid stone foundation, rising to the roof through the floor of the\r\nveranda at its outer edge, were the thickly planted supporting pillars.\r\nThese pillars like a long line of watchful sentinels, were placed in\r\ntrios. The two outside pillars of each trio, were only separated from\r\nthe middle one by a few inches of space, and were as nearly as possible,\r\nten inches in diameter. The one in the center was much larger and held\r\nthe post of honor as the flag bearer of its triumvirate. By pushing its\r\nway through the roof it became a huge flag pole, fifty feet from base to\r\ntip, with a beautiful banner proudly waving from its ball crowned\r\nsummit. These pillars, both large and small, were bark-coated below the\r\nroof. Each one had been carefully selected for its symmetrical\r\nstraightness, as a representative tree from the different forests of the\r\nworld. Altogether, they formed a most interesting collection, to which\r\nmight well be devoted, many hours of admiring inspection, by every lover\r\nof trees.\r\n\r\n\"A wide lattice work of bark-laden tree limbs, of a uniform size\r\ncompleted the charmingly rustic cornice, which, like some endless\r\ncurtain seemed to hang suspended from the caves of this bark-thatched\r\nroof.\r\n\r\n\"Having sufficiently studied the exterior beauties of this remarkable\r\nbuilding, of such arborescent magnificence; let us mount the steps to\r\nthe broad, breezy veranda. Pausing a moment to inhale the refreshing\r\ncoolness of the crisp air; and to admire the wave curving sparkle of the\r\nblue waters of Lake Michigan, we then pass to the shining portal of\r\nrichly colored, highly polished woods, which form the main entrance.\r\nHere, covering the entire available floor-space, piled high in splendid\r\nprofusion; we behold the garnered riches from the forests of the world.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not attempt to describe my varying emotions of wonder and\r\ndelight, as I wandered for hours through a bewildering maze of the\r\nwonderful exhibits, which formed this unrivalled collection of choice\r\nwoods. As I advanced, my admiration for its variety and extent continued\r\nto grow. I began to perceive that, spread out before me, was the\r\nopportunity of a life time, which, if properly utilized would prove for\r\nme the permanent foundation of an education on the subject of timber,\r\ntrees and forestry products. With this realization came the resolve,\r\nthat I would devote time enough to each exhibit, to permit me to examine\r\nit in detail, leisurely and carefully.\r\n\r\n\"The separate exhibits from the States of the Union and from other\r\nnations, were skillfully classified and so artistically arranged, as to\r\nshow in the most effective manner the lovely grain, color and finished\r\nbeauty, of the different woods.\r\n\r\n\"All the valuable timbers were represented by three specimens. The first\r\nand second, were polished planks displaying the grain-finish, of both\r\nradial and transverse sections. The third, a cross section or disc,\r\nshowing the heart, body-wood, sap-wood and bark; the full size of the\r\ntree represented. These discs proved by far the most interesting part of\r\nthe exhibit. To me they were a revelation! They at once introduced me to\r\nthe individuality of the tree. I could read the history of its life as I\r\nscanned the ever-widening circle of annual rings, which, from center to\r\ncircumference, marked the slow growth of ages, as the tree advanced from\r\ninfancy to maturity.\r\n\r\n\"By means of these polished discs, I could touch and become personally\r\nacquainted with the precious, the famous, and the historical trees of\r\nthe world. The mighty teak and deodar from India. The giant mahogany\r\nfrom Central America. The olive of Palestine. The cedars of Lebanon. The\r\nancient oaks of Dodona. The magnificent dye-wood and rosewood of\r\nBrazil. The majestic live-oak of Florida. The druidical-oaks of England.\r\nThe smooth, elastic bamboo, which by its size and strength becomes so\r\nuseful in house-building, in both China and Japan. The towering spruces\r\nand sugar pines of our Pacific Coast. The great elms of New England. The\r\njustly famous, white pines of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. The\r\nwonderful spice-woods of Java and Ceylon. The curious soap and rubber\r\ntrees of Brazil. The tall sugar maples and smooth, symmetrical beeches\r\nof New York. The great hemlocks of Pennsylvania. The stately cypress,\r\nthe royal tulip tree, and the beautiful evergreen white holly, of our\r\nsouthern forests. The highly prized black-walnut of Tennessee and North\r\nCarolina. The fruitful, free-growing chestnut, so common all over the\r\nUnited States. Finally, that towering king of all trees, the matchless\r\nmammoth redwood of California.\r\n\r\n\"These redwoods are such veritable giants in size, that the half disc\r\ndisplayed in the California Section, with its thick ring of bark on the\r\nrounding side uppermost, stood sixteen feet high. From the huge trunk of\r\nthis tree came the accompanying plank of such extraordinary dimensions,\r\nthat a placard proclaimed it the largest plank the world ever saw. This\r\nplank was five inches thick, twenty-five feet long and sixteen feet nine\r\ninches wide; containing about two thousand feet of lumber, board\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n\"In the Brazilian Section I found a large disc, accompanied by a\r\nspecimen branch, with the leaves, flowers and fruit of a most remarkable\r\ntree. To this tree, the world owes a debt of gratitude for its generous\r\nunfailing supply of a rich wholesome food. Almost every child through\r\nthe sense of sight, touch and taste, is familiar with that peculiar,\r\ntriangular-shaped, sharp-edged, black-coated nut of commerce, with such\r\na delicious kernel, known as the brazil nut. Very few however, know\r\nanything of the tree which bears them, or how they are attached to the\r\nbranches from which they are suspended. As it is a matter of such\r\ngeneral interest to both old and young, I shall take the liberty of\r\ndevoting a few moments to a brief description of this gigantic tree,\r\nwhich the botanist has named 'The Bertholletia Excelsa.'\r\n\r\n\"These wonderful trees grow most abundantly in the valleys of the\r\nAmazons, and generally throughout tropical America. In size and beauty,\r\nthey rank as monarchs of their native forests. They attain an average\r\nheight of one hundred and thirty feet, having smooth cylindrical,\r\nbeautifully proportioned bodies; which often have the astonishing\r\ndiameter of fourteen feet, when measured fifty feet above the ground.\r\nLike columns in some vast cathedral, these majestic representatives of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, raise their massive trunks one hundred feet\r\ntoward heaven, before they commence to branch out, and to form a medium\r\nsized, symmetrical top. At this height grow the flowers and fruits.\r\n\r\n\"The fruits are globular, with a diameter of five or six inches. Each\r\nfruit contains within its black, woody, shell, from eighteen to\r\ntwenty-five closely packed seeds or brazil-nuts. These fruits, as they\r\nripen, fall from their lofty position. At the proper season they are\r\ncollected, broken open and marketed by the Indians, who roam through\r\nthese dark, gloomy, miasmatic forests. The extraordinary abundance of\r\nthe crop may be measured by the fact, that one port alone on the Amazon\r\nRiver, exports annually more than fifty millions of these excellent\r\nnuts.\r\n\r\n\"Brazil-nuts are largely eaten as a nutritious and palatable food, by a\r\nmultitude of people in many lands. They yield a generous supply of fine\r\nbland oil, which is highly prized for use in cookery, and also for\r\nlubricating all kinds of delicate machinery.\r\n\r\n\"The timber furnished by these fruitful and beautiful trees, is light\r\nand durable, easily worked, well adapted to the purpose of\r\nboat-building; especially canoes of the largest size. Indeed! I may add\r\nas a final tribute to these noble trees, that they are the peculiar\r\nproduct of the American Continent, of which it may well be proud! They\r\nhave bodies so tall, so straight, so large, so symmetrical, so free from\r\nknots, and so easily dug out, that the largest ship used by the hardy\r\nand fearless old Vikings of the Eleventh Century, could easily have been\r\nfashioned from a single one!\r\n\r\n\"In connection with the main exhibit in the Forestry Building itself, I\r\nvisited and examined the magnificent and astonishing timber displays\r\nshown in the State buildings of California, Oregon, and Washington.\r\nThese exhibits were in every way worthy of those three great states of\r\nthe Pacific Coast; they also served to largely increase the\r\npreponderance of the exhibit from the United States as a whole, over\r\nthat of all other nations combined. The demonstrated extent, variety and\r\nwealth of our timber supply, was a matter of profound astonishment to\r\nvisitors from other lands; while at the same time these things were\r\nequally a source of surprise and pride to every citizen of the Republic\r\nwho saw them.\r\n\r\n\"After a most delightfully well spent week, devoted almost entirely to\r\nforestry productions, I was prepared to sum up my impressions of the\r\nsignificance and value of the knowledge I had gained in my first\r\nlesson. It was plain to me that the magnitude and importance of the\r\nsubject, was but little understood or appreciated, by the average\r\nAmerican citizen. I saw that our people were very much in need of some\r\ngreat object lesson like the forestry exhibit of the Columbian\r\nExposition, to make them properly realize the immensity of our debt of\r\ngratitude to Mother Nature for her munificent gift of trees to mankind.\r\n\r\n\"I shall now conclude my story of the Forestry Exposition, by naming\r\nfrom the exhibit the following, as a few of the many things of use and\r\nvalue, which we owe to our benefactors, the trees; things which are so\r\nnecessary to our comfort and happiness, which in so many ways, affect\r\nthe progress, welfare and civilization of the world's people.\r\n\r\n\"Among the more important gifts from the trees I shall place lumber and\r\nshingles, used in the construction of houses, barns and all kinds of\r\nhabitable or industrial buildings; bridges, boats, ships and sailing\r\nvessels of all kinds; furniture, fencing and a great variety of farming\r\nutensils. Under the head of fuel, I may mention fire-wood and charcoal.\r\nIn the class of vehicles we have wagons and all kinds of carriages from\r\nthe stage coach to the pullman palace car. Some kind of lumber or timber\r\nenters very largely into the construction of almost every kind of\r\nmachinery. In the miscellaneous group we find wood-alcohol, dye-wood,\r\nmedicinal barks, roots and galls; precious gums, resins and all of the\r\nspices; the various kinds of excelsior used for packing, bedding and\r\nupholstery; wood-pulp and paper, inlaid work, vegetable ivory, and\r\ncocoanut shells; the entire series of willow ware, and wooden, or\r\nhollow ware. In food products, we are confronted by a most astonishing\r\narray of edible sprouts, berries, delicious fruits and nutritious nuts,\r\nforming altogether a multitude of things which, in civilized life, we\r\ncould not possibly do without.\r\n\r\n\"In considering the impressions conveyed to our minds by growing trees,\r\nwhich inherently possess a sturdy vitality, that can resist the\r\nvicissitudes of passing ages; we instinctively recognize them as\r\nnature's noblest gift to man. As majestic monarchs, in the empire of\r\nplant life, they appeal to us as companions, which become dearer with\r\nthe associations of each passing year, until love for them becomes a\r\nfeeling almost akin to worship.\r\n\r\n\"This worshipful feeling, no doubt, comes to us as a heritage from a\r\nremote ancestry. In the days of ancient story, groves of noble trees\r\noffered primitive man, nature's grandest and most appropriate\r\ncathedrals, for the celebration of his worshipful rites. Is it a matter\r\nof wonder, that he unhesitatingly accorded to them, the distinction of\r\nbeing sacred? The emotional nature of this primitive man was a mystery\r\nwhich he could neither understand nor control. Often, he suffered untold\r\ntortures from the agonizing perturbations to which it easily became a\r\nprey. Hidden in the deep shade of his sacred grove, in his happier\r\nmoments, the sighing of each passing breeze through his leafy canopy,\r\nbecome to his untrained ear, the whispered blessing of nature's placated\r\nGod! When the dark pall of the Storm King shrouded all things with a\r\nterrifying gloom, the restless moaning of such a mass of writhing\r\nboughs, lashed by the fury of the blast, became the angry shriek of the\r\nDemons of Destruction, which left him prostrate and trembling in the\r\nthroes of a paroxysm of worshipful fear. Analyzed, these actions show\r\nthe result of man's environment.\r\n\r\n\"By the way of a contrast, and as a testimonial to the planetary growth\r\nof man's emotional nature, gained from the ages of progress; let us\r\nquestion modern man as he leans confidingly, in a contemplative mood,\r\nagainst the broad trunk of some giant of the forest. With uncovered\r\nhead, he muses in silence; he senses a vague feeling of awe for this\r\nmagnificent specimen of matured life in the vegetable world. With every\r\nsense attuned to the overtones and undertones, produced by the\r\nvibrations of nature's harp; he catches the rythmic song of the sappy\r\ncurrents, as they swiftly fly to feed the swelling cells, where the\r\nbuilding energy of their tiny hearts of protoplasm, ceaselessly changes\r\nthe elements of soil and sunlight, into the woody fibre of this mighty\r\ntree. How beautiful! How like the complicated mechanism of the human\r\nbody! Wonderingly he questions! Can it be possible, that the pulsing\r\nenergy of the protoplasmic life of the tree, is identical with that of\r\nman, and all other forms of cosmic life? Does each great throb of the\r\nplanetary heart, re-energize and move in unison, the protoplasmic\r\ncenters of all forms of life? Who shall say?\r\n\r\n\"In discussing the peculiar fitness of our present organization, to deal\r\neffectually with the question of tree planting, we discover, that in the\r\nco-operative association of so many people, we possess a marked\r\nadvantage over the small farmer, which enables us to treat large tracts\r\nof land as a single farm; by devoting all of the rough, stony ground,\r\nsteep hill sides, unsightly gullies and areas of poor, gravelly soils,\r\nto the purposes of timber and fruit culture.\r\n\r\n\"Harmoniously united, we are financially and intellectually stronger;\r\nless influenced or retarded by motives of selfishness and greed;\r\nsurrounded by conditions of easy comfort; armed with skill by study and\r\nexperience; and withal inspired by a knowledge of the great necessity\r\nfor replacing our forests; we are exceptionally well prepared to carry\r\nforward this great work, so successfully and to such an extent, that a\r\nfew decades hence our hill sides and mountains, shall be re-clothed with\r\nbeautiful forests of much finer trees--all choice timber--vastly more\r\nvaluable than the original stock.\r\n\r\n\"By more systematic methods of terracing the steep hills; by close\r\nplanting of the young trees, with varieties selected by reason of their\r\nvalue for lumber, timber, nuts and fruit; by a judicious thinning out of\r\nthese young trees so soon as they have grown to a useful size; a\r\nprofitable crop of timber may be secured each year, with a positive\r\nbenefit to the remaining trees. This operation may be repeated many\r\ntimes, before a partial replanting becomes necessary. By an extended use\r\nof these methods, the excellence of the timber supply may be doubled,\r\nwhile the aggregate yield will be trebled. The landscape will be\r\nbeautified and permanently changed. Barren, unprofitable hills, and\r\nrough unsightly mountain tracts, rejoicing in a new growth of beautiful\r\nverdure-clad trees, will become objects of general admiration; while at\r\nthe same time, the value of these lands, as a source of wealth, will be\r\nincreased a thousand fold.\r\n\r\n\"As these forests continue to grow, the shade deepens, the store of\r\nretained moisture increases, perceptible changes in the climate are\r\neffected; the evils of flood, erosion and drought are checked; the soil\r\nmade deeper and richer; the rainfall largely increased; the climatic\r\nconditions become more genial, and the cooling, drouth-dispelling rains\r\nbecome more frequent.\r\n\r\n\"The interesting and beautiful process, by which these changes are\r\naccomplished, may be briefly stated as follows: With the growth of each\r\nyear, the area of the leafy surfaces of these forest trees is enormously\r\nextended. Measured by the same increasing ratio, many additional\r\nthousands of tons of moisture are pumped up and given to the winds in\r\nthe form of a fine vapor, by the tireless industry of these lovely\r\nleaves. This vapor is taken up by the clouds--nature's aerial\r\nreservoirs. Soon this treasure of waters thus accumulated, is restored\r\nto the thirsty earth by a largely increased rainfall. Autumnal frosts\r\nripen and loosen each crop of leaves; they fall silently to the ground,\r\nwhere they quickly form a thick, soft carpet of ever increasing\r\nthickness. Through the action of shade and moisture, the under surface\r\nof this carpet becomes a layer of fine leaf mold, which in turn offers\r\nrich food for the sustenance of millions of tiny feeding rootlets from\r\nthe trees of the forest. The closely interwoven fibre of these rootlets,\r\neverywhere forms a strong web for the carpet, which firmly holds in\r\nplace the soft, porous, underlying soil, safely protecting it from the\r\ndestructive erosion which, especially on the steeper slopes, swiftly\r\nfollows the dashing violence of heavy rain storms. Gradually this leafy\r\ncarpet grows in strength and thickness; like some great sponge it sucks\r\nup and retains the waters of the snows of winter, with those of the\r\nincreased rain-fall of summer.\r\n\r\n\"Thousands of mountain torrents, the beginnings of destructive floods,\r\nare thus checked, absorbed and shorn of their disintegrating energies.\r\nThe garnered waters from this wonderful leafy sponge, slowly percolate\r\nthrough the soil, to reappear in a multitude of living springs of pure\r\nsparkling water. From these springs gently flow the tiny rivulets, which\r\nin turn become the full streams that gladden the plains and valleys\r\nthroughout the long scorching months of summer.\r\n\r\n\"By a close analysis of the beneficial results which follow the annual\r\nrecurrence of these beautiful processes, we may form a correct estimate\r\nof the vast importance of this tree-planting labor, to which this day,\r\nwe gladly offer our best energies and our best thought. We begin to\r\nperceive the magnitude of the blessing which may be conferred on\r\nmankind, in general and on the agriculturist in particular, by the\r\ncontinued work of covering our hills and mountains with valuable\r\nforests.\r\n\r\n\"We have discovered from nature the secret of a power that shall enable\r\nus to control many of our environmental conditions. We hold the key to\r\nthe solution of a great problem, which for the past quarter of a\r\ncentury, has puzzled the brightest minds and best thinkers among our\r\nstatesmen. The problem of how best to control the devastating floods,\r\nwhich each year, with increasing power and violence, continue to destroy\r\nhundreds of lives and millions of dollars worth of property, on the\r\nfarms and in the towns and cities throughout the river valleys of our\r\nbroad land. For this growing terror, we hold the cure! With the\r\ncompletion of this system of forestry, the floods will disappear. The\r\ninterests of our coastwise and inland commerce, will be greatly extended\r\nand benefited. Many rivers, with beds choked and obstructed by the\r\nunsightly rocks and debris deposited by the annual floods, and for the\r\nsame reason, dry for many months in each year, will again become\r\nnavigable. Perennial streams, fed by permanent mountain springs, will\r\nserve to keep these rivers with full channels throughout the year.\r\n\r\n\"The clear water will be free from the lighter silt which now finds its\r\nway to the sea; slowly filling up the river-mouth harbor, and finally\r\ndestroying the commerce of the city which depends upon it. In this way,\r\nevery individual, child or adult, who plants a tree, aids directly in\r\nthe restoring some distant seaport to its former commercial importance;\r\nand has proudly earned the right to be placed as an important working\r\nmember, on the peoples' great 'Committee for Improvement of Rivers and\r\nHarbors.'\r\n\r\n\"Tree-planting, persistent tree-planting, by all classes of agricultural\r\npeople, offers the only means or hope of checking the wide-spread,\r\ncalamity-producing floods and erosions, which commenced with the\r\ndestruction of our mountain forests. The destructive process is\r\naccelerated with each passing year. Unchecked, it threatens, a few\r\ncenturies hence, to rob us of all fertile soil; to reduce our hills and\r\nmountains to a dreary waste of bare, sun-scorched rocks: our plains and\r\nvalleys, to uninhabitable deserts. United action is therefore\r\nimperative!\r\n\r\n\"Other incentives, worthy of our attention, urge us to commence the\r\nwork. By yielding even one-half of the area of our tillable lands to the\r\nneeds of forestry, we have all the richest lands left in the remaining\r\nhalf. The productiveness and fertility of these lands is sure to be\r\nspeedily doubled. The amount of labor required to produce the same crops\r\nfrom the diminished areas, will be reduced one-half. A most important\r\nconsideration!\r\n\r\n\"The third generation of people, after the planting of these forests,\r\nwill gather from them, such an abundant harvest of nuts, fruits, and\r\nvaluable timbers, as will more than repay the entire cost of the land\r\nand labor required to produce them; leaving a handsome surplus to be\r\ndevoted to carrying forward the work on a still larger scale; in regions\r\nless promising and more remote, even within the borders of the arid\r\nlands. With this lesson before us, how can we hesitate or falter in our\r\nefforts to successfully carry forward this important work?\r\n\r\n\"I wish now, to call your attention to the following facts regarding the\r\nfarms and farmers of our Republic, which altogether offer additional\r\nincentives for the speedy adoption of co-operative farming on a scale\r\nlarge enough to admit of timber culture, as the only available source of\r\nrelief. The significance of these facts has scarcely been considered, by\r\nthose most deeply interested. The farming lands now owned or controlled\r\nby our agricultural people, represent the accumulated capital or savings\r\nof a life time; frequently of several generations of the same family.\r\n\r\n\"A steady decline in the market values of all farm products during the\r\npast twenty-five years, has in the same ratio, affected the selling\r\nvalue of the farm to such an extent, that from forty to fifty per cent\r\nof its value at the commencement of the decline, has been swept away and\r\nlost to the farmer, from the credit side of his available resources.\r\nThis alarming shrinkage, has in the aggregate, amounted to many\r\nmillions, yes, billions of dollars! The financial distress which has\r\nfollowed, has correspondingly affected many other industries. It has\r\nbeen the real cause of the forced sale of many fine farms at such\r\nruinously low prices, as to sacrifice at one blow, the savings of a\r\nlife-time. Each sale of this character serves to depress the market\r\nvalue of all lands in that particular locality. In this way the disaster\r\nspreads and gathers additional force.\r\n\r\n\"A very large number of farmers, who have not as yet been forced to sell\r\ntheir farms, have found themselves so financially cramped, as to be\r\nunable to secure the additional lands they had hoped and planned to\r\npurchase for their children. What is the result? A most abundant harvest\r\nof blasted hopes for the sons and daughters of our American farms!\r\n\r\n\"Capital in the hands of shrewd people, is always on the alert, waiting\r\nfor such opportunities for investment. These investors through capital\r\nwish to live without effort, upon the proceeds of the labor of others.\r\nThey seem to understand clearly, that to own land, is to own the\r\nservices of the people who must have access to the land in order to\r\nlive. This is why a land monopoly is more to be feared than other kind.\r\nFor this reason we may well be alarmed, as we note from time to time,\r\nthe large tracts of land which are being purchased by wealthy\r\nindividuals, foreign syndicates, home corporations and land monopolists\r\ngenerally, who are quietly operating, while prices are so abnormally\r\nlow, to obtain such complete control of our valuable agricultural lands,\r\nas will enable them in the near future, by a concert of action, to raise\r\nprices to such a pitch, that practically they would then be beyond the\r\nreach of the ordinary farmer.\r\n\r\n\"These shrewd, far-seeing monopolists, having obtained control of the\r\nlands in question, can dictate such rents to all applicants, as will\r\nbarely enable them to live. As a matter of fact, it is quite probable\r\nthat they would much prefer not to rent their lands, because they could\r\nsave for their own pockets, the wages of a great many workers, for at\r\nleast five months in each year, by placing five-thousand-acre-farms in\r\ncharge of a superintendent; who with two assistants, could live on the\r\nfarm, taking proper care of the stock, tools and machinery, throughout\r\nthe year. During the seven busy months, beginning about the first of\r\nApril, transient labor, of the homeless tramp order, could easily be\r\nprocured to work by the day, week or month, as the needs of the farm\r\nmight demand.\r\n\r\n\"The growing competition for even this kind of uncertain employment,\r\nwould tend constantly to reduce the wages. The danger from this source\r\nhas been fully demonstrated during the past twenty-five years, by the\r\nadoption of this disposition of their holdings, on the part of a great\r\nnumber of large land owners. The success of the bonanza farm, has proved\r\nperniciously infectious. Our small farmers, already in financial\r\ndistress, cannot hope to compete with such large farms, so recklessly\r\ncropped by the monopolist for the largest possible cash returns, without\r\nregard for the future condition of the soil. To double the capital\r\ninvested in five years' time, is the only concern of the investor.\r\nWhatever the land will sell for thereafter, is only so much additional\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot close our eyes to these warning facts. They foretell the\r\ncoming whirlwind of disaster. We may be sure that, if these things are\r\nallowed to continue without opposition, long before the close of the\r\ntwentieth century, our agricultural people will be reduced individually\r\nto the abject serfdom of a houseless, homeless day-laborer. At this\r\ntime it is almost impossible for a majority of the sons and daughters of\r\nthe farms of our Republic to obtain possession of enough land to enable\r\nthem to follow in the footsteps of their parents, by devoting their\r\nlives to agricultural pursuits. Many of them have already entered the\r\ndownward path of the unfortunate tenant. Many others have been forced to\r\nfind employment in other pursuits.\r\n\r\n\"You ask how can this coming disaster be averted? How can our people be\r\nsaved from such a hopeless future?\r\n\r\n\"I answer, by the farmers, united with those who wish to become farmers,\r\ncoming together everywhere in force; by pooling their issues; by helping\r\nthemselves; by organizing co-operative farms like this, armed with\r\nschools in which skilled workmen may be taught to successfully carry on\r\nprofitable allied manufacturing industries. Monopolistic farms cannot\r\nthen successfully compete. With demonstrations, such as we are making\r\nhere to-day, springing up by hundreds and thousands in each county and\r\nstate, during the next thirty years, what may we expect? The last\r\nremaining serf will have been emancipated. The hopeless tenant and the\r\nlandless farmer can no longer be found. No one can be induced to toil,\r\nfor owners of the monopolistic farm. The owners will not and cannot work\r\nthemselves. The experience of a few unprofitable years will urge them to\r\nsell their lands to the co-operators at such prices as they may be\r\ninclined to offer. The victory will be ours. A glorious victory truly!\r\nBut, we must not expect to gain this victory without a severe struggle.\r\nIn the earlier stages of the movement, the monopolist will soon\r\nrecognize the co-operative farm as an enemy which must be fought to the\r\nbitter end, must be stamped out. To this end they will strive in every\r\nway to prevent us from obtaining possession of desirable lands.\r\n\r\n\"This determined opposition we must expect and be prepared to meet.\r\nForestry will help us to another solution of the problem. As the\r\ntree-planting farms continue to multiply, the increased rainfall will\r\ncause the area of tillable lands, to gradually extend beyond the borders\r\nof the arid lands. Therefore in case of necessity, we may turn to these\r\narid lands for relief. In such an event, the question of forestry\r\nbecomes an important factor.\r\n\r\n\"By referring to the tenth annual report of the director of the U. S.\r\nGeological Survey, we learn that the arid regions of the United States,\r\ncomprise the astonishing area of one million, three hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles. This immense region contains more than one-third of all\r\nour lands; a territory much larger than that of the thirteen original\r\nstates combined. North and south, it stretches for hundreds of miles on\r\neither side of the Rocky Mountain Range, that great backbone and\r\nwater-shed of our Continent. On the west, it covers nearly all of the\r\nsurface of that vast, broken and irregular basin, lying between the\r\nRocky and Sierra Nevada Mountains. On the east, it occupies that\r\nextended and peculiar domain of high plateaus, treeless plains and\r\nalkali barrens, known as the Great American Desert.\r\n\r\n\"From this broad expanse of arid lands, in accordance with the\r\nstatements of the survey officials, we may choose an area of one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand square miles of irrigable lands; that is lands which\r\nmay be restored to productive fertility, by means of irrigating ditches\r\nalong the valleys, and by building great catch basins, near the head\r\nwaters of a multitude of mountain streams, in which may be conserved,\r\nthe wasting waters of melting snows and those of the heavy mountain\r\nrainfalls combined. At this point we may mention incidentally, that this\r\narea of irrigable lands could be largely increased, by covering the\r\navailable slopes of the Rocky Mountains with dense forests of fine\r\ntimber. With this accomplished, the annual rainfall would be doubled,\r\nwhile the necessary conditions would be established, which, a few\r\ndecades hence might yield an annual crop of valuable timber, that would\r\nsoon repay the entire cost of planting and culture.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the last named increase, we may add an area of lands\r\nequal in size to the state of Illinois, which are beyond the reach of\r\nirrigating streams. We find these lands along the eastern foothills of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, and around the borders of the Great American\r\ndesert. They may easily be restored to fertility, by the skillfully\r\napplied labor of a legion of co-operative farms. At varying depths\r\nbeneath these lands, flow perennial streams of artesian water. By the\r\nspouting, life-giving waters of a vast number of artesian wells, a large\r\nproportion of these desert lands can be transformed to an agricultural\r\nparadise. The cost of these wells, would be but little more than the\r\nexpense of the labor required to bore them.\r\n\r\n\"But, says the objector, are not these mostly alkali lands? Of course\r\nthey are! And for that reason offer greater possibilities of value! Can\r\nthey be made to grow wheat, and thus increase the bread supply? Is a\r\nquestion that comes from the mouths of the world's great army of bread\r\neaters, six hundred million strong. Just think of it!\r\n\r\n\"For reasons which I shall state presently, I hope to be able to show\r\nwhy these alkali lands when properly irrigated, can be made to produce\r\nabundant crops of wheat.\r\n\r\n\"For the past twenty years, leading men of science, who, alive to the\r\nimportance of increasing the world's supply of wheat; have given close\r\nattention to statistics which seemed to indicate that the yield per\r\nacre, of the wheat fields in all countries, is steadily decreasing.\r\nDecreasing to such an extent as to make it probable, that in the near\r\nfuture, the yield on a large proportion of these lands, will become too\r\nmeagre to pay the cost of cultivation. A long series of carefully\r\nconducted experiments demonstrated the truth of these alarming\r\nstatistics.\r\n\r\n\"This discovery led to a general search for some cheap, available,\r\nchemical, compound, which might restore these worn out wheat lands to\r\ntheir former productiveness.\r\n\r\n\"In an address, delivered at Bristol, England, near the close of the\r\nnineteenth century, by Professor William Crookes, president of the\r\nBritish Association for the advancement of science; he says; 'Wheat\r\npre-eminently demands as a dominant manure, nitrogen fixed in the form\r\nof ammonia or nitric acid. Many years of experimentation with nitrate of\r\nsoda, or Chili salt-petre, have proved it to be the most concentrated\r\nform of nitrogenous food demanded by growing wheat. This substance\r\noccurs native, over a narrow band of the plain of Tamarugal, in the\r\nnorthern province of Chili, between the Andes and the coast hills. In\r\nthis rainless district for countless ages, the continuous fixation of\r\natmospheric nitrogen by the soil, its conversion into nitrate by the\r\nslow transfiguration of billions of nitrifying organizations, its\r\ncombination with soda, and the crystallization of the nitrate have been\r\nsteadily proceeding, until the nitrate fields of Chili have become of\r\nvast importance, and promise to be of inestimably greater value in the\r\nfuture. The growing exports of nitrate from Chili at present, amount to\r\nabout 1,200,000 tons annually.'\r\n\r\n\"In carefully analyzing this lesson from the lips of Professor Crookes,\r\nwe discover that the same peculiar climatic conditions which made a\r\nChilian desert so valuable, have been continuously at work in our great\r\nAmerican desert for a great many thousands of years.\r\n\r\n\"For this reason, our uncounted acres of alkali lands, are so rich with\r\nstores of this valuable nitrogenous compound, that by proper treatment\r\nthey may become the most valuable wheat-producing lands in the world.\r\nThe desert shall become the source of abundance! Under the transforming\r\ninfluence of a generous water supply, forests shall spring up, and\r\nfields of waving grain shall flourish around the village homes of a\r\nhappy, prosperous people! Altogether, we have an empire of these\r\nirrigable lands now worthless, awaiting the transforming labor of the\r\nhomeless and landless, to restore them to productive fertility.\r\n\r\n\"When thus restored, these lands, at the lowest estimate, will be worth\r\nthe enormous sum of two billion, eight hundred and eighty million\r\ndollars, which in due time may be transferred to the credit side of the\r\nwealth account of the nation! Long before this available domain of such\r\nvast possibilities has been conquered and reclaimed, the longing desires\r\nof all who wish for land, and for agricultural lives, for themselves and\r\ntheir children, will have been most abundantly satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"In looking over this broad field of possibilities spread so temptingly\r\nbefore us, we are able to discover the importance of the work of\r\ntree-planting, which now demands our attention. Strengthened by\r\nconcerted action, encouraged by new ideas and better methods we become\r\nfirm in our convictions, that it is an imperative duty for us to\r\ncontinue the good work. We must increase the number of our co-operative\r\nfarms with their tree-planting schools, until, educated and moved by the\r\nforce of so many demonstrations, a great majority of the people of this\r\nRepublic shall demand, that the entire area of the range of the Rocky\r\nMountains within our geographical limits, shall become a permanent,\r\npublic park; with such a wealth of territory and variety of climate,\r\nsuch beauty of scenic grandeur and magnitude of picturesque proportions,\r\nas the world never saw before. This matchless reservation is to be\r\ndevoted to the needs and uses of forestry, mining, the preservation of\r\nits great variety of natural curiosities, and of American Game.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to this Pride-of-the-World-Park, the people shall also\r\ndemand, that all of the most available portions of the mountains of the\r\nPacific Coast Range, the Sierra Nevadas, the Alleghenies, the\r\nAdirondacks and the White Mountains, shall be reserved by the\r\ngovernment, and set apart for the same uses and purposes.\r\n\r\n\"With the passing of this magnificent domain of mountain territory to\r\nthe permanent control of the government, would come the beginning of the\r\ngreat public forests; which would clothe with new beauty, cover and\r\nprotect in the most useful manner, the principal water-sheds of our\r\nbroad continental possessions. Thus increasing to a degree approaching\r\nperfection, the purity and abundance of the crystal flood, that shall\r\nflow from a countless multitude of new springs of living water. The\r\nvolume of water from these springs, shall furnish a supply sufficient to\r\nmaintain with full channels, a perpetual flow in that net-work of lakes\r\nand rivers, that arterial system of fertility and commerce, which\r\nvariegates and adorns the bright face of our fair land.\r\n\r\n\"Altogether, in considering the broad scope of this stupendous plan as a\r\nwhole, we have before us a most important work, which must be\r\naccomplished! A work which affects the welfare and happiness of every\r\ncitizen of our Republic! A work which is in every way worthy of our most\r\nearnest and persistent effort!\r\n\r\n\"This day, we have made a propitious beginning, which augurs well for\r\nsuccess. Let us on all occasions encourage tree-planting as a sacred\r\nduty which we owe to future generations! A duty which must not be\r\nneglected! From this time forward, let us strive in every way to\r\norganize a broader, wiser, more powerful movement! Carried forward by\r\nthe resistless force of an enthusiasm born of a mighty purpose; with\r\nstrong hands and willing hearts, let us undertake the speedy\r\naccomplishment of our chosen task! Let us remember our responsibilities\r\nas immortal beings! Let us be mindful that life on this plane of\r\nexistence is very brief; that an eternity of countless ages lies beyond!\r\nTherefore we cannot afford to be selfish! Let us heed the warning of\r\nnature's just law of compensation, which declares that in the higher\r\nlife, selfishness becomes a torment in comparison with which a crown of\r\nthorns would seem a coveted blessing!\r\n\r\n\"In our devotion to this noble work, let us ignore all unworthy\r\nthoughts of self interest! Possibly we may not as mortals, live long\r\nenough in the material form to reap many of the benefits that are to\r\nfollow. But, being immortal; and having passed to a higher realm, where\r\nwe are endowed with a keener, broader, mental, and spiritual vision;\r\nlost to the sense of time or physical pain, we may then behold the\r\nresults of our work, in the increased enjoyment of our children and our\r\nchildren's children; while the centuries, like moments, glide swiftly by\r\nand are lost in the endless procession of passing ages!\r\n\r\n\"Finally, as an additional source of encouragement to continue a work\r\nwhich we may not live to see mature; let us consider carefully the\r\nsignificance of the fact, that he who causes two blades of grass to grow\r\nwhere only one grew before, is counted a public benefactor. Judged by\r\nthe same standard, he who causes two trees to grow where only one grew\r\nbefore, is a benefactor of mankind, whose good works shall earn for him\r\nthe blessings of a hundred generations! By the same logic, it surely\r\nfollows, that the people, who cause a forest of trees to spring from the\r\narid bosom of desert earth, become the distinguished benefactors of the\r\nhuman race, who offer shade, shelter, fuel, fertility and sustenance, to\r\na thousand future generations! They shall be thrice blessed! Having\r\narisen to the demands of a higher life of unselfishness, where the\r\nsolidarity of all life is recognized as a self-evident truth; they have\r\ngathered a sufficient store of love and wisdom to admit them to the\r\ndomain of causation. Classed as worthy workers in that domain, they are\r\nentrusted by nature, with the magical key which unlocks the climatic\r\ngate, to her pent up floods of fertility.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, people of Solaris, I leave this presentation of the\r\nsubject for your earnest consideration until the recurrence of our next\r\nannual festival. During the interval, I feel confident that you will all\r\njoin me in a closer study, of a topic which has already proved one of\r\nsuch absorbing interest,--of such vast importance.\r\n\r\n\"Thanking you for your close attention, and for the frequent applause,\r\nwhich has demonstrated your approval, I recommend that we do now\r\nadjourn, to enjoy the waiting banquet which is to follow as the next\r\norder of the day.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreat applause greeted Fillmore Flagg at the close of his oration.\r\nGeorge Gerrish arose and paid a glowing tribute to the wisdom and\r\neloquence of the orator; after which, grasping him by both hands, he\r\nsaid, \"Fillmore, I am proud of you! Solaris is more than proud of the\r\nmasterful way in which you have treated the entire subject! Your\r\npresentation of the theme, seemed to me to be so perfect, so exhaustive\r\nand eloquent, that in the future I may not expect to again hear its\r\nequal.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment Fern Fenwick came forward, radiant in her loveliness,\r\nher beautiful eyes shining with emotions of love and gratified pride. In\r\na voice, whose clear, well modulated tones, thrilled him as no music\r\ncould, she said, \"Nobly done, Mr. Flagg! I knew you would not disappoint\r\nme! Your speech was the most lovely poem in prose that I have ever\r\nheard! So perfectly charming, that I find it far beyond my best words of\r\npraise! In return for such an eloquent tribute, the trees should join in\r\na grateful anthem! You have sounded the key-note; it is the evident\r\ndestiny of co-operative farming in the twentieth century, to restore\r\nthese noble trees to their rightful domain.\"\r\n\r\nThe banquet, which followed the oration proved a great success. It was\r\nreally one long, interwoven garland of witty speech and inspiring music,\r\ntogether with the merry jingle and melodious crash of silver and china.\r\nThe enjoyable zest of the entertainment, was spiced and flavored with\r\nthe appetizing aroma of an abundance of delicious, well-cooked food.\r\nPlaced at the head of the first table, our hero and heroine were at all\r\ntimes the center of attraction; the observed of all observers. \"A\r\nhandsome couple, evidently heaven-ordained for each other,\" was the\r\nuniversal comment.\r\n\r\nThe dance in the evening, was fittingly chosen as the closing function\r\nof this famous festival. In arranging the program, Fern and Fillmore\r\nwere selected by the floor managers as the leading couple. Inspired by\r\nthe music of an excellent band under the leadership of Gilbert Gerrish,\r\nthe assembled guests with the vigor and enthusiasm of youth caught the\r\nprevailing spirit of merriment, and gave themselves up to the\r\nfascinating movement of musical measures. Lost in the charm of the mazy\r\ndance, the merrymakers noted not the flight of time. The last number on\r\nthe program came all too soon for them.\r\n\r\nDismissed by George Gerrish, the people of Solaris left the hall in a\r\njoyful mood. They declared with one accord, that the day of the\r\ntree-planting festival, had proved the happiest one on the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF GILBERT GERRISH; OR, THE STRENGTH OF THE WEAKEST UNIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Gilbert Gerrish the day of the festival was one long to be\r\nremembered: a day so laden with enjoyment for him, that all\r\nconsciousness of his affliction was blotted out. His musical genius was\r\nfree and unfettered. In such a mood, the music he drew from his violin\r\nwas more wonderful and entertaining than ever before. Fern Fenwick was\r\nastonished and delighted. She soon became so much interested, that at\r\nintervals between the dancing, she came upon the platform to engage him\r\nin conversation. Grateful for such marked attention from the\r\ndistinguished patroness of the farm, the natural shyness and reticence\r\nof the young musician, was quickly dispelled. To Fern, it was remarkable\r\nhow eloquently and interestingly he could talk upon almost every topic\r\nshe chose to introduce. On the subject of ethical, social, inventive and\r\neducational work, as exemplified by the different phases of club life at\r\nthe farm; Gilbert was at his best. He spoke with such enthusiasm and\r\nperfect knowledge of details that Fern Fenwick was profoundly impressed.\r\nShe then and there determined, at the first convenient opportunity, to\r\nhave Fillmore Flagg relate to her more in detail, the many incidents\r\nconnected with his farm life, and how this interesting boy had managed\r\nin so short a time, to make himself such a universal favorite with the\r\nfarm people, both old and young.\r\n\r\nThat night before retiring, Gilbert told his mother in confidence, that\r\nMiss Fenwick was the brightest, most beautiful and most lovable woman he\r\nhad ever met. \"Tell me truly, Mamma! Do you think she is really in love\r\nwith Mr. Flagg? I hope it may be true! For I know he deserves to win the\r\nlove of the best and most charming woman that ever was born!\"\r\n\r\nWhile this confidential interview between mother and son was in\r\nprogress, Fern and Fillmore were speaking of Gilbert in such a way, that\r\nif overheard by Gertrude Gerrish it would have stirred the pride in her\r\nmother heart.\r\n\r\n\"I declare, Fillmore!\" said Fern, \"to my mind that clever lad, Gilbert\r\nGerrish, is one of the most astonishing products of Solaris Farm! You\r\nhave promised to tell me the story of his life here on the farm. I am\r\nnow ready to hear it. At the festival dance I had an opportunity to\r\nengage him in conversation, and the good fortune to so win his\r\nconfidence, that he could talk to me without embarassment. It was then\r\nthat I discovered what a brilliant intellectual prodigy, eloquent\r\ntalker, skilled musician, and cultured artist he really was. There is\r\nsomething mysterious about his strong, intellectual, spiritual nature,\r\nwhich has aroused my interest in him, and my sympathy for him, to a\r\ndegree that is very unusual for me. The more I know of him the more I\r\nwish to win his friendship.\r\n\r\n\"What a terrible misfortune, that he is so afflicted by the deformity of\r\nthat spinal trouble! I cannot help picturing him as possessed of a\r\nphysique in harmony with his glorious intellectual and spiritual\r\nunfoldment. How naturally then, he could win the love of some equally\r\ngifted, noble woman. How happy they could make each other through the\r\npassing changes of a long and useful life. Aside from my speculative\r\nfancies, I do wonder what the future has in store for him? How bravely\r\nhe bears himself! He does not seem inclined to be gloomy or\r\nmisanthropical under the burden of his misfortune!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, my dear Fern, that my story will unravel the mystery. I am\r\ndelighted to find that you have already become interested in Gilbert,\r\nand have discovered so many of his good qualities! I can assure you that\r\nhe is worthy of your sympathy and friendship! He is a noble fellow!\r\nRichly endowed, with a remarkable, intuitive, spiritual nature! His\r\nenthusiasm, persevering efforts and ingenious devices, have contributed\r\nmuch towards the success of this co-operative farm. The value and\r\nvariety of his especial work in the department of experimental farming,\r\nhas proved his extraordinary ability, and justly earned for him the\r\ntitle of the 'wonder worker of the farm!'\r\n\r\n\"On account of Gilbert's frail form and sensitive nature, it was deemed\r\nwise by his ever watchful parents, to give him the protection of an\r\nisolated home life. For this purpose, a cozy cottage was built in the\r\ncenter of its own grounds, some distance away from all other buildings.\r\nThis cottage was charmingly fitted and furnished in such style and taste\r\nas would satisfy the artistic ideas of this domestic trio, and at the\r\nsame time, afford quiet, retired, spacious rooms, for Gilbert's musical\r\nand other studies. Rooms where violin and piano practice, at any hour\r\nthat might suit his fancy, could disturb no one.\r\n\r\n\"Referring to that haunting desire which impresses you to picture\r\nGilbert as possessing a magnificent physique, in harmony with his\r\nbrilliant, mental and spiritual unfoldment; I accept it as another proof\r\nof the growth of his spiritual body to the beautiful proportions you\r\nseem to see. All psychics who come within the radius of his powerful,\r\nspiritual aura, sense or see this strong symmetrical body. His\r\naffectionate and emotional nature is beautifully developed. No one can\r\nappreciate the graces and charms of a refined, beautiful woman more\r\nkeenly than Gilbert Gerrish! Yet, I know, that in this life, he does not\r\nfor one moment, even dream of a possible marriage with any woman. He is\r\nloyally devoted to his spiritual ideal!\r\n\r\n\"For many months, I have been to Gilbert a trusted friend and\r\nconfidential companion. In this capacity, I have learned his story of\r\nthe hidden romance of his young life. This story I will repeat to you as\r\nan illustration of the high order of his boyish character. It cannot\r\nfail to increase both your admiration and your respect, for this\r\nyouthful devotee at the shrine of love.\r\n\r\n\"When Gilbert was ten years old, while attending school at St. Louis, he\r\nbecame acquainted with Rita Estelle Ringwood. She was in many ways a\r\nremarkable girl; only two months younger than Gilbert. Tall and\r\nstraight, with a well rounded figure, already as large as a maid of\r\nfourteen, Rita gave promise of an early development into a lovely woman.\r\nWith a large, finely formed head, crowned by a luxuriant growth of soft,\r\nthick, wavy, chestnut hair; a smooth, creamy complexion, pleasing\r\nfeatures, firm mouth and well rounded chin; large, full, soft, brown\r\neyes, unusually expressive; a strong, well turned white throat and neck,\r\nsymmetrical shoulders, perfectly formed hands and feet; and a well\r\npoised, graceful carriage, she appeared to Gilbert as some divine\r\ncreature. From the first moment of meeting, a strong bond of mutual\r\nattraction drew them together. If kept long apart, both became nervous\r\nand restless. When again united, they were quickly at peace with\r\nthemselves and all the world. By a strange coincidence, as it\r\ntranspired; Rita's parents lived in a house just across the street,\r\nalmost in the front of the one occupied by the Gerrish family. Through\r\nthe children, the parents soon became intimate friends. As Gilbert had\r\nnever cared to play with boys of his own age, either on the streets or\r\nat school, it was natural under the circumstances, that he should devote\r\nhimself entirely to Rita, as the only congenial playmate he had ever\r\nknown. Very soon, as a consequence, the twain were almost always\r\ntogether, either in one home or the other. They read or studied from the\r\nsame book, often pausing to discuss some question of more than usual\r\ninterest. In music, they had the same tastes, the same predominating\r\npassion for it. Gilbert soon taught Rita to use the violin; while Rita\r\nin turn taught Gilbert to play the piano. Each could then alternate, in\r\nplaying violin accompaniments to piano music. Much practice soon enabled\r\nthese artistic children, to render such duets with thrilling effect. In\r\nso delightful an occupation, hours passed swiftly by. A series of\r\nselections were chosen for evening concerts. The parents were called in\r\nto enjoy them. In the eyes of the parents, both children were manifestly\r\nhelpful to each other. Rita never seemed to notice Gilbert's misshapen\r\nbody. She evidently responded, only to impressions emanating from his\r\nmore perfect and dominant, spiritual body. Gilbert was conscious of this\r\nfact, and always seemed at ease in her presence. As the months flew\r\nswiftly by; these strange children grew more devotedly fond of each\r\nother. Three summers had witnessed the growing together of these two\r\nharmoniously attuned souls.\r\n\r\n\"The day following Gilbert's thirteenth birthday, he was depressed by\r\nsome overshadowing cloud of sadness. He could not explain it, nor, could\r\nhe throw it off. The sequel came the following week, when a great wave\r\nof pestilence, in the form of malignant typhoid fever, swept over the\r\ncity. It claimed Rita as one of its first victims.\r\n\r\n\"Heart broken! Rita's parents hastily returned to New York, where,\r\nsurrounded by early associations, they vainly and hopelessly struggled\r\nto forget their terrible bereavement.\r\n\r\n\"To Gilbert, the shock was frightful! His parents, George and Gertrude\r\nGerrish were alarmed. They feared for his life! He wandered about with\r\ndry, staring eyes, like one in a trance. He could not weep! For days, he\r\ncould neither eat nor drink! At last, came the crisis! Reason seemed\r\nabout to leave her throne! Then it happened, that Gilbert grew strangely\r\ncalm and hopeful.\r\n\r\n\"In a few short days the improvement was magical. His beautiful eyes\r\nshone with the fires of new inspiration! Questioned by his parents, he\r\nassured them that Rita still lived. He knew that she was not dead!\r\nClairvoyantly, he had seen her, more beautiful than ever.\r\nClairaudiently, he had heard, over and over again, the sweet familiar\r\ntones of her voice. All this through his own mediumship and more\r\nbesides. Controlling his hand and arm, in her own identical\r\nhand-writing, she had written to him long messages filled with loving\r\nconsolation, bidding him look hopefully forward to a happy reunion in\r\nthe land of the spirit, the home of the soul! Almost nightly in dreams,\r\nshe came to him, when for happy hours they were again united in the\r\nenjoyment of the old familiar companionship, so dear to his waking\r\nmemories.\r\n\r\n\"Through Gilbert's mediumship, his parents became spiritualists. This\r\nhappened some months before I visited them in St. Louis, on my first\r\ntrip west, from Newburgh. Some months later, the family came to Solaris.\r\n\r\n\"In a recent conversation, speaking to me of his life work, his hopes\r\nand his ambitions, Gilbert said: 'Fillmore, I know that my life here\r\nwill be short. I know that I have a work to do here on this farm, for\r\nthe future benefit of my brothers and sisters in earth life. I know that\r\nin spirit life, Rita waits for me to join her, when that work is\r\nfinished. I now realize that swiftly passing days, weeks, months and\r\nyears, are precious portions of time which I must improve to the utmost.\r\nI know that this primary school of life has many useful lessons, which I\r\nmust master as quickly as possible. I know that the sooner they are\r\nmastered, the sooner I shall be prepared to enter a higher class in\r\nspirit life. I know that as a spirit, in that land of golden sunlight,\r\nfreed from the burden of this unsightly prison of flesh, I shall be\r\nclothed in a spiritual body as symmetrically perfect as my highest ideal\r\ncan picture. I know that thus clothed, and crowned with the perpetual\r\nyouth of the spirit; I shall again be united with my darling Rita, never\r\nmore to part. Together, in obedience to the law of an infinite love, we\r\nshall go hand in hand, up the paths of wisdom which lead to the summits\r\nof the hills of everlasting progress. I know that during my sojourn\r\nhere, when I am weary and most need the healing balm of her presence, my\r\nRita can come to cheer and help me. Knowing all this, life is full of\r\npromise! I have no time to be sad or lonely! The world is bright! I am\r\nambitious to make its people my friends, by creating for them, better\r\nand brighter conditions for the enjoyment of life.'\r\n\r\n\"This, my dear Fern! is the romance, which like some secret charm,\r\nGilbert wears in his heart. His armor against all evil! The bright star\r\nof his ambition! The beacon light of his hope!\"\r\n\r\n\"The romance is indeed a most extraordinary one! The story is\r\nexquisitely beautiful! Its pathos fills my heart with both joy and\r\nsadness! In the development of his mediumship, following his\r\nbereavement, how like my own, has been his experience! This explains my\r\nsympathetic desire for his friendship. What a noble fellow he is! I\r\nshall be proud to claim him as my friend! Now Fillmore, you must tell me\r\nof his work for the farm. I am anxious to know more of the peculiar\r\nmethods of this inspired genius.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well! In the center of the large garden at the rear of the Gerrish\r\ncottage, is a roomy workshop, built for Gilbert's sole use and\r\noccupancy. Alone in this shop, he has mapped out for himself such a\r\ncourse of study, experimental work, and industrial amusement, as might\r\nsuit the fancy of his swiftly changing moods; or conform to the passing\r\nwhims of his busy brain. To the combined interests of Solaris farm, he\r\nis intensely devoted. To keep a realistic picture of the farm always in\r\nhis mind, he has drawn an immense map, large enough to completely cover\r\nthe wall space on one side of the shop. He subdivided, colored and named\r\nthe subdivisions on the map, after a bold, brilliant scheme of his own.\r\nThe result is a matter of astonishment to all beholders. The map seems\r\nto possess some charm of attraction, which no one can explain. On each\r\nsubdivision from time to time, Gilbert has tacked cards filled with\r\nfinely written notes, setting forth from his own standpoint, a history\r\nof the subdivision, its peculiarities, and capabilities of the different\r\nsoils; character of crops and fertilizers, together with such\r\nsuggestions for perfection or improvement, as his thorough knowledge of\r\nchemistry might determine; or his keen, analytical, observation of the\r\ncrops produced, might indicate.\r\n\r\n\"This map of itself, is a most valuable work; involving an immense\r\namount of intelligent, skillful labor; also much study of chemistry, and\r\nof horticultural and agricultural authorities. As an indication of our\r\nappreciation of its value, this map has been taken as a suggestive model\r\nfor the completion of those made and kept by the clerical force employed\r\nin the farm office.\r\n\r\n\"On the south side of his shop, two large doors open into a roomy,\r\nglass-roofed hot house, containing a very unique collection of potted\r\nplants, which, under the skillful hands of this young enthusiast, are\r\nundergoing the different stages of experimental treatment, such as he\r\nmay deem necessary, to prove or disprove his many pet theories or\r\nfancies, in regard to care, growth, insect enemies, and to application\r\nof electric light, sun light, heat, moisture and fertilizers. Each plant\r\nbears a fruitful crop of cards, giving a summary of results and\r\nconclusions. Each one of these cards may contain, in skeleton form, the\r\nsubject matter of a brief essay, brimful of valuable suggestions and\r\ninteresting statements. Sooner or later, these essays, signed\r\n'Experimenter,' are liable to find their way into the contribution box\r\nat the door of the Press Club.\r\n\r\n\"Gilbert's collection of birds and insects, forms another interesting\r\nfeature of his industrial museum. These collections were made, arranged\r\nand classified, in order to afford opportunities for making a careful\r\nstudy of the insect enemies of his plants, and also to discover what\r\nbirds were most destructive to the different insects. The birds he kept\r\nin cages; the insects in glass-covered boxes.\r\n\r\n\"The care of these things, and the time and labor necessary to collect,\r\nclassify and arrange them, would to most people, prove a grievous\r\nburden. To Gilbert, it was simply another mode of recreation and\r\namusement. On the live insects, he tried the effects of such chemicals\r\nas might destroy them without injury to the growing plants. To his caged\r\nbirds, Gilbert fed his bugs, worms and moths, carefully noting the kinds\r\nthey most eagerly swallowed. His conclusions were always briefly written\r\nout. They proved a perfect mine of valuable information, to be used in\r\nperfecting better methods for farm culture.\r\n\r\n\"Aside from this kind of work; in the departments of his shop devoted to\r\nexperiments with clays, mica, soils, minerals and the various powers,\r\nattractions and affinities of electricity, his constructive ideation and\r\ninspired mentality, always gave him an excellent crop of good results.\r\nAltogether, such superior work, carried forward in his own unique way,\r\nhas added many hundreds of dollars to the annual income of the farm. In\r\nthe department of experimental farming, as I have before stated, his\r\nwork has proved most brilliant and helpful; generally leading to the\r\nadoption of many improved methods for successfully selecting, planting\r\nand growing these new crops.\r\n\r\n\"Considered as a whole, such a variety of valuable contributions have\r\nconvinced our people, that physically speaking, one of the farm's\r\nweakest units, under the fostering development of co-operative\r\norganization, is capable of becoming one of its most valued productive\r\nworkers. The wonder of it all, is, that Gilbert is able to accomplish\r\nsuch important results, while following a scheme he has devised as a\r\nsource of personal diversion!\r\n\r\n\"Turning to Gilbert's intellectual, artistic and esthetic life, we\r\ndiscover that this gifted boy finds the same source of comfort and\r\namusement in his devotion to the art of music. In this branch of\r\naccomplishments, you, my dear Fern! have had occasion to observe how\r\nimportant a factor he has become, in organized social life at Solaris.\r\nHe is such a general favorite, that without an effort, he has been able\r\nto so impress the strong individuality of his noble character upon the\r\nminds of our farm people, that the effect for good has been truly\r\nwonderful!\"\r\n\r\n\"This is exceedingly interesting, Fillmore! How charmed I am with your\r\ncompleted story of this marvelously gifted boy! All that you have told\r\nme about Gilbert, only seems to confirm my previous convictions, that he\r\nis really one of the most astonishing products of Solaris farm! No\r\nwonder he is such a general favorite! He has nobly earned the title!\r\nWith such intelligence and genius, possessed, embodied and expressed by\r\nits weaker units; is it any cause for wonder, that the success of\r\nSolaris as a co-operative colony, is so pronounced?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nOUR HERO AND HEROINE DISCUSS AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day following the festival, we find Fillmore Flagg in the office\r\nof the farm, going over the books of the company with Fern Fenwick. To\r\nmost women, such a task would soon prove unbearably monotonous and\r\ntiresome. However, she neither grew restless or inattentive. At all\r\ntimes on the alert to note each new point of interest; her questions on\r\nevery subject indicated a remarkably intelligent conception of the\r\ngeneral plan of the work. Finally, having satisfied herself that she\r\nunderstood the status of the farm well enough to enable her to propound\r\nher list of queries in the proper order, and in such a manner, as would\r\nmost successfully bring to her the information she wished to obtain:\r\nwith note-book in hand, she commenced by saying: \"Now Fillmore, I am\r\nready to take up my series of questions about Solaris, which you have\r\nkindly consented to answer. I promise in advance to be good; to try to\r\nrefrain from untimely interruptions, by asking a host of irrelevant\r\nquestions at inopportune moments!\r\n\r\n\"First, I wish you would tell me just what is represented by the one\r\nthousand shares of capital stock, of the Solaris Farm Company?\"\r\n\r\n\"The corporation, as you know, is so limited,\" said Fillmore, \"that the\r\nland cannot be sold, and the stock can only be sold to the Company;\r\nnevertheless, the original cost of the land is covered by the stock. The\r\nentire capitalization of $250,000, which I think will fairly represent\r\nthe financial status of the farm at the end of the first five years, is\r\ndivided as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Purchase price of land                $ 32,000\r\n\r\n     Improvements                            68,000\r\n\r\n     Buildings                              100,000\r\n\r\n     Live stock, equipment and machinery     50,000\r\n                                           --------\r\n                                           $250,000\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the last named item, about $25,000 is estimated for machinery.\r\nHowever, this amount does not fully represent its real value. In many\r\ninstances, it only gives the actual cost of the raw material used in\r\nconstruction. This capitalization does not seem so large, when we\r\nconsider the small individual holdings. Having a par value of $250 a\r\nshare, we have only $500, in the two shares, for each one of the five\r\nhundred co-operators. I think it has been wisely determined by a\r\nmajority vote, that as the resources of the farm continue to develop and\r\nmature, the increase of profits shall come to the individual stockholder\r\nin the shape of larger wages, instead of by dividends on stock. Although\r\nthis is not a money-making institution, and was not so intended from the\r\nbeginning; a fact properly emphasized by the foregoing. Yet, by the way\r\nof arriving at some estimate of its future value, I feel safe in\r\npredicting, that, if the stock should be offered in the markets of the\r\nworld, and dividends declared in the usual way, twenty years hence,\r\nthese certificates of stock would be worth $1,500 per share. In other\r\nwords, would have doubled in value six times during that period.\"\r\n\r\n\"Judging by what I already know of the farm and its resources,\" said\r\nFern, \"I quite agree with you in this view of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"In considering the future needs of such a large number of\r\nco-operators, which in ten years may be increased by pensioners and\r\nchildren, to one thousand people; do you think this farm is large enough\r\nto meet the demand?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the purpose in view it is ample,\" said Fillmore. \"Operated in\r\nconnection with so many allied industries, I think a farm of 5,000 acres\r\nwould be sufficient. That would be ten acres for each one. Here in\r\nSolaris, we have 12-8/10 acres of land for every adult member of the\r\ncompany. By carrying the process of intensive farming to a very high\r\nstate of perfection; Prof. Grandeau, at Capelle, France, has actually\r\ndemonstrated, that it is possible to grow 8½ bushels of wheat--one\r\nman's bread food for the year--on one-twentieth part of an acre of land.\r\nArmed with so many advantages, with better conditions, superior methods,\r\nand more intelligent workers; I feel sure we can easily accomplish here,\r\nall that Grandeau has done in France, and more. Besides, you must\r\nremember, that we shall have the additional support of quite a large\r\nnumber of profitable industries, to help us in meeting the demands of an\r\nincreased number of consumers.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds logical and reasonable,\" said Fern. \"I now remember, that\r\nwhile traveling in Europe with my father, gathering agricultural\r\nstatistics: the Capelle experiments were brought to our attention at\r\nthat time, as worthy of careful consideration. I am greatly pleased to\r\nknow that you are already familiar with them. To continue the subject, I\r\nwish to say that I am much impressed with the outlook for intensive\r\nfarming at Solaris. Aided by the wonderful power of applied co-operative\r\nthinking, combined with your careful and comprehensive system of\r\nbook-keeping, which embraces every field and department of the farm! I\r\nbelieve that ten years hence, you will be able to give to the world,\r\nsome very valuable statistics on the whole subject of farming, both\r\nintensive and diversified.\r\n\r\n\"I have noticed with an unusual degree of interest, the apparently\r\nlavish use of electric power in operating the factory works and farm\r\nmachinery. I am really quite curious to know just how it is generated.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a very large question!\" said Fillmore. \"At different times\r\nsince the commencement of our work, we have used three methods for\r\ngenerating electricity. First, the old fashioned steam dynamo. Second,\r\nthe direct conversion of coal into electricity. Third, the gathering of\r\ngreat quantities of this subtle force from the atmosphere, through a\r\ncertain vibratory action, set up by intense concentration of the sun's\r\nrays. As a result of a vast deal of co-operative thinking and careful\r\nexperimentation; the last named process, has been so perfected and\r\ncheapened, as to entirely supersede the first two. The powerful\r\nbatteries of Solaris concentrators, which you see around the\r\npower-house, and at various points on the farm, are important factors in\r\nthis work. I confess, that I am rather proud of the remarkable success,\r\nwhich we have achieved in this line of invention. When I gave a title to\r\nthe farm, I had a premonition, that solar heat and force would be so\r\nsuccessfully harnessed to both industrial and agricultural work, that\r\nthe suggestive name of Solaris, would soon become as famous, as it was\r\nfitting and well earned.\r\n\r\n\"In applying this power to all kinds of farm and factory work, we have\r\nsucceeded far beyond my most sanguine expectations. With a plant almost\r\nentirely built by our own co-operative labor, we are able to generate an\r\nabundance of cheap power, which can be easily and safely conducted to\r\nthe most distant portions of the farm. This power is readily available\r\nat any desired point, and for all kinds of work; becoming the magic\r\nmotor by which we operate trains of trolley cars, for handling grain,\r\nhay, corn and all heavy crops; great gang-plows, rollers, harrows,\r\ncultivators, planters, drills, reapers, threshers and motor wagons; all\r\nso perfectly constructed and so easily controlled; that with them a\r\nwoman, fittingly dressed and gloved, protected from the heat of the sun\r\nby a canopy, comfortably seated on cushions and springs, may accomplish\r\nthe roughest and heaviest kind of farm work, without fatigue or\r\ndiscomfort. In fact, our women soon find it the most delightfully,\r\nfascinating work on the farm.\r\n\r\n\"In connection with such a powerful motor, a single person, operating\r\none of these improved agricultural machines, can do an amount of work in\r\nsix hours, which under the old system would require ten hours of severe\r\ntoil by six men and twelve horses. Of course, such machinery can only be\r\nproduced and operated by large co-operative farms like this; with a\r\ncarefully chosen force of co-operators, who are thinkers as well as\r\nworkers; who are intellectually, physically and socially prepared to\r\ninvent and construct machines that are perfectly fitted to do this\r\nparticular kind of work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really!\" said Fern, \"this is as interesting as it is remarkable! This\r\nsun-generated force, this magic motor, so perfectly adjusted to\r\nagricultural work, under the test of practical use; which has proved so\r\neasily controlled; together with the tireless host of wonder-working\r\nmachines, which this force has called into being; is truly a marvel\r\nworthy of the twentieth century!\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Fillmore! Why is it that these things have not been done\r\nbefore?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many reasons. I think I can give you the principal one. From\r\na remote period of time, a large majority of the people of this planet\r\nhave gained a living by following agricultural pursuits. Bowed down\r\nunder the weight of severe toil, hopeless under the pressure of a\r\nbelief, that labor was a curse which they might not seek to escape;\r\nconfined by ignorance to a narrow sphere of action, which kept them from\r\nlooking upward and outward; it is not strange, that so many passing\r\ngenerations of these people, should never once dream of adopting a\r\nseries of progressive changes for the betterment of their condition.\r\n\r\n\"Such people were incapable of understanding, that, in order to secure\r\nthe best and most successful results from agricultural work, it requires\r\na systematic application of the highest order of brain work: that this\r\nbrain work, must inspire a harmonious collection of trained, muscular\r\nworkers, operating under the most favorable conditions. By the way of a\r\ncontrast, how helpless were the lives of these farmers! As a rule they\r\nworked under the most discouraging conditions, distrustful and envious,\r\nuneducated and narrow minded; how could they be prepared to comprehend\r\nthat basic law of progress, which is embodied in the idea of unselfish\r\nco-operation?\r\n\r\n\"For these reasons, co-operative thinking and co-operative farming, have\r\nnot heretofore been successfully combined. Here and now, in the first\r\ndecade of the twentieth century, a few unselfish souls, the advance\r\nguard of the coming army, responding to the pressure of progressive\r\nevolution, have risen to such intellectual heights as has enabled them\r\nto discover, that by the aid of a harmonious union of thought and labor,\r\na collection of people, working the soil unselfishly together, can\r\neasily attain results which, the most brilliant individual effort, armed\r\nwith the wealth of a millionaire, could never hope to accomplish.\r\nInspired with this idea, the people of Solaris, as pioneers in the work,\r\nare striving earnestly to demonstrate the absolute success of\r\nco-operative farming.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I have seen with my own eyes, I know as a verity!\" said Fern,\r\nenthusiastically. \"Therefore I feel like shouting in the ears of our\r\npeople: Well done, good and faithful servants in the cause of progress!\r\nThe victory is already won! It is yours!\r\n\r\n\"Your explanation of the cause of the late coming of practical\r\nco-operation in agriculture, appeals to my mind, as a very clear one.\r\nThat the ignorance and selfishness of the individual, has from the\r\nbeginning, proved the real obstacle, is now quite plain to me.\r\n\r\n\"However, returning to my list of questions. How is it, that the fields\r\nand cultivated grounds at Solaris, are so free from weeds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Fillmore. \"The answer to that question, is another argument\r\nin favor of co-operative farming. Weeds have always been counted by\r\nfarmers, as among the worst of the pests which they have been obliged to\r\ncontend with. Under the most adverse conditions, weeds will grow,\r\nflourish, and ripen an appalling quantity of seed; where all useful\r\nplants will languish and finally perish. To keep them down, is a task\r\nwhich requires a great deal of hard work. To destroy them, root and\r\nbranch, is a problem which has occupied the minds of our people for the\r\npast thirty months. After much thoughtful work, we have reached a\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n\"During the period of frost, from the first of December to the first of\r\nMarch, the weedy ground is thoroughly stirred several times. After each\r\nstirring, the ground is swept by a broad stream of concentrated\r\nheat-rays--both light and dark. These rays are generated by a number of\r\nbatteries of Solaris mirrors, or great sun glasses. This operation soon\r\nwarms the ground and causes the weeds to put forth a tender growth.\r\nAfter such a growth, a week of frosty weather kills it down. This\r\nprocess is repeated until the weeds are all gone. When the necessary\r\nfrosts do not appear, or when the work is carried on during warmer\r\nweather, a scorching from the sun glasses, kills the weeds even more\r\neffectively than frost. In this way the cultivated ground on the farm,\r\nhas been entirely freed from weeds. As a result, the yield of crops has\r\nbeen largely increased, while the labor of cultivation has been\r\ncorrespondingly reduced. That back-aching work of hoeing, has been\r\nalmost entirely dispensed with. Machine culture does the work.\r\n\r\n\"The great advantage gained by cropping soil free from weeds, is most\r\napparent in case of wheat culture. In such soils, the wheat can be\r\ndeeply sown by the drill, beyond the reach of predatory birds. This\r\ndevelops a strong root-growth in the young plant, which as a consequence\r\nrequires more space. To meet this demand, care is taken to have the\r\ndrill-rows made one foot apart--running north and south. These wide rows\r\nallow free access of air and sunlight to the soil, which may then be\r\ncultivated. Under the old system this space would be full of weeds;\r\ntherefore impracticable. This gives the young wheat a chance to spread\r\nout, to send up from twenty to forty stout stems from the root-system of\r\na single grain of seed. The growing stems become more sturdy, bear\r\nlarger heads, heads with more and larger kernels, of heavier, brighter\r\nwheat. With this culture, the yield is increased one-third--many times\r\none-half--and the quality wonderfully improved. Fully one-half of the\r\nusual quantity of seed is saved.\r\n\r\n\"By repeating this method for a few years, carefully choosing the seed\r\nfor each planting from the best kernels borne by the largest heads, the\r\nordinary wheat-crop, without extra fertilization, may easily be doubled\r\ntwo and one-half times; while the quality of the entire crop is raised\r\nto the grade of extra fine, which will readily sell at fancy prices for\r\nseed wheat. The net gain, is a large cash balance in favor of\r\ncultivating a weedless soil. What is true of wheat culture in such\r\nsoils, is true in a large measure with most other crops; more especially\r\nwith corn, cotton and all kinds of garden crops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop a moment, Fillmore!\r\n\r\n\"Did I understand you to say that these immense discs, these mammoth,\r\nweed-scorching mirrors, were made here at Solaris? How can such\r\nexpensive things be made, for a price that would allow so many to be\r\nused?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, these concentrating mirrors and burning glasses combined, are the\r\nproduct of the inventive genius and skillful work of our people. A\r\ncombination of brain and muscular work so successful, that these discs,\r\nalthough they are of such great size and weight, are quickly and\r\ncheaply made from thick plates of flat glass, which we manufacture from\r\nour abundant supply of excellent sand! The quality of the glass in these\r\nplates is of the best; clear, soft, and tough, just the kind that will\r\nmost readily take the proper concave and convex surfaces, when treated\r\nby the evenly applied heat of swiftly revolving electric brushes. With\r\nplenty of strong machinery to handle these heavy plates, a few skilled\r\nworkers, can with ease, soon transform them into perfect, lense-shaped\r\ndiscs. Similar discs, made by the slow, tedious process of nineteenth\r\ncentury methods, would cost many thousands of dollars for each one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have answered my question both briefly and perfectly! I recognize\r\nin these great mirrors, a swift, wonder-working agency, that shall make\r\npossible a new system of farming; which means, in the improved\r\nconditions for mankind that must follow, a revolution in social methods,\r\ncalculated to bring them quickly into harmony with a rate of progress\r\ndemanded by the twentieth century.\r\n\r\n\"I will take up another question. It is in connection with the large\r\namount of cultivated ground devoted to vegetables. How do you manage to\r\nmake it profitable to grow such a quantity of perishable things?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is another important question, which will require an answer so\r\nlengthy, that perhaps you may grow weary before I have finished.\r\nHowever, I will try to be brief. During the past year, we have taken\r\nfrom the ground devoted to vegetable growing, more than 100,000 bushels\r\nof cabbage, cauliflower, onions, beets, mangel-wurzel, carrots,\r\nparsnips, salsify, potatoes, sweet-potatoes, cassava, turnips, kohlrabi\r\nand artichokes. The best part of the story is, that this heavy crop has\r\nproved profitable, to a degree far beyond our expectations! As a rule,\r\nthis class of vegetables, so heavy and so perishable, cannot be\r\nprofitably grown in large quantities, except in locations near a large\r\nmarket town. This advantage, Solaris does not possess. To overcome this\r\ndifficulty, was an additional task, which must be conquered, by the\r\nallied forces of co-operative thinking and co-operative working. In the\r\nsolution of this puzzling question which was finally reached, the great\r\nmirrors and burning glasses of the Solaris concentrators, were again\r\ncalled upon to play an important part.\r\n\r\n\"The first necessity, was to reduce the weight of the vegetables, and at\r\nthe same time, to arrest all tendency to decay. The second was to\r\nprotect them from the attack of insects, by placing them in neat,\r\nstrong, insect-proof packages.\r\n\r\n\"A large curing establishment was built and equipped with machinery;\r\nmost of which was made at Solaris, from especially devised patterns.\r\nConvenient trolley lines, connected the curing-house with the fields.\r\nThe vegetables, crisp and fresh from the ground, were quickly brought to\r\nthe washing machines, on trains of cars laden with shallow trays, which\r\npermitted them to be swiftly handled without bruising. In these\r\nmachines, they were thoroughly cleansed, scraped, and freed from tops,\r\nrootlets and imperfections. This process complete, they were placed in\r\ntrays on traveling carriers, which delivered them to the dicing\r\nmachines. In the dicing machines, they were soon reduced to inch-cubes.\r\n\r\n\"In passing from these machines, the cubes fell on traveling screens of\r\nfine wire, which formed the first of a long series of drying rollers.\r\nThe drying rollers, on the way to the packing rooms in the large\r\nstore-house, passed through a long system of sheet-iron conduits, which\r\nwere well heated by the concentrated rays of the sun from the mirrors\r\nand sunglasses. So well did the drying rollers do their work, that by\r\nthe time the cubes had reached the store-house, and were delivered by\r\nthe elevators into the storing-bins in the packing house, they were\r\nreduced to a dry, hard kernel. They had lost three-fourths in bulk, and\r\nabout the same proportion in weight.\r\n\r\n\"The funnel-shaped bottoms to the storing-bins were so arranged as to be\r\nabove the long rows of packing tables. A series of graduated spouts,\r\ndelivered the cured vegetables to the packers, who, standing or sitting\r\nas they might prefer, could, with but little effort and much speed, fill\r\nthe prepared boxes with the little cubes.\r\n\r\n\"These boxes, of a uniform size and shape, were made from thick layers\r\nof heavy straw-paper, made stiff and firm under high pressure. The farm\r\nin manufacturing them, was able to utilize large quantities of surplus\r\nstraw from the grain fields, which could not be used as forage. In the\r\ncorners of the boxes, between layers of paper, while they were being\r\nmolded into shape, were inserted small, triangular pieces of wood. These\r\nbevel-shaped strips were cut six inches in length, just the depth of the\r\nboxes, in which they served as upright cornerposts. The shallow covers\r\nfitted each box with a telescope joint.\r\n\r\n\"In the process of box-making, the layers of paper were saturated with a\r\nchemical, germicide solution, which made the boxes insect-proof; yet,\r\nwhich would not odorize, nor in any way injure the contents. In the\r\nprocess of packing, each box and cover was lined with thin sheets of\r\nparafine paper, as an additional guard against moisture. When the boxes\r\nwere filled and sealed, they were strongly coopered, by adding four thin\r\nlaths of strong wood. These laths, one-eighth of an inch thick, two\r\ninches wide, and just the length of the box; two at the bottom, and two\r\nat the top, were securely nailed to the cornerposts; thus completing a\r\npackage which was cheap, strong, light, durable, rodent and\r\ninsect-proof. With a capacity of a half-bushel, it weighed only five\r\npounds. Filled with cubes, the gross weight was but thirty-five pounds.\r\nAn ideal package, which could be piled high in transportation or\r\nstore-house without injury; the upright cornerposts taking all the\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n\"The half-bushel or thirty pounds of dried cubes in each box, represent\r\ntwo bushels of fresh vegetables. Cured and packed in this way, they\r\nreach distant markets, sound, sweet, clean and nutritious. No waste, no\r\nworms, no musty smell, no decay! Frost cannot hurt them, heat preserves\r\nthem! For long voyages, army and navy use, mining, lumbering, and\r\nhunting outfits, they are simply invaluable! For all classes of\r\nconsumers, they are cheaper, cleaner and more wholesome than the\r\nordinary stale and wilted vegetables, for sale in the city markets! We\r\nhave named these cubes, 'Solaris Vegetable Concentrates,' a title which\r\nwe have copyrighted. The packages readily wholesale at 75 cents, to be\r\nretailed at one dollar. At these prices, they yield a handsome profit to\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\n\"Last year we placed hundreds of sample packages on the general market,\r\nwhich soon proved the excellence of the goods, and later brought heavy\r\norders for this year; even more than we can fill, for many of the\r\nvarieties. A valuable hint to us, that we must devote more ground to\r\ngrowing those particular kinds.\r\n\r\n\"Our 'Solaris Mixture Concentrates' are almost equally popular. We also\r\nhave a growing demand for our 'Solaris Stock Food,' which we put in\r\ncheaper packages, to wholesale and retail at 50 and 75 cents. This\r\nmixture is made up of equal proportions of dried cubes of potatoes,\r\ncarrots, cassava, and mangel-wurzel. It has proved the acme of a\r\nhealthful, fattening stock-food; especially beneficial in counteracting\r\nthe evil effects of heavy grain-feeding; or in cases of emergency, to\r\ntake the place of forage or cut-straw food.\r\n\r\n\"In a weedless soil, much of the heavy labor of growing vegetables is\r\neliminated. In curing and preparing them for market in this way, a great\r\namount of light, pleasant work, is available for our women co-operators.\r\nConsidered as a whole, this vegetable scheme is one of the notable\r\nachievements of Solaris farm, of which the members of the company are\r\njustly proud.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is surely a most excellent work! It is a clear demonstration of\r\nwhat important results may be attained, by the application of thinking\r\nto agricultural work. In this instance, the lesson of your brilliant\r\nsuccess, impresses my mind as a most convincing argument in favor of\r\nco-operative farming. I feel sure that it will appeal to the multitude\r\nwith the same force. It is but another illustration of the old saying,\r\n'Nothing succeeds like success!' A few such examples will serve to\r\noverthrow the prejudices of a thousand years! They will win for you a\r\nhost of followers in the cause of co-operative farming.\r\n\r\n\"Now Fillmore, let us consider another matter. At the time we made our\r\ntour of inspection, my attention was attracted to groups of oddly\r\nconstructed barns, scattered here and there about the farm. What are\r\nthese buildings, and for what purpose are they used?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are curing-barns. They mark another wide departure from the usual\r\nmethods of ordinary farming. For many years it has been a ruinously,\r\nwasteful custom with farmers, to allow their crops of corn, grain and\r\nhay, to stand in the fields while curing. All, subject meanwhile to the\r\ndestructive effects of storms, dews and all kinds of adverse weather,\r\nwhich as a rule, destroyed much of the crop, and reduced the remainder\r\nto the condition of an inferior grade.\r\n\r\n\"By the use of these barns, we are able to inaugurate an entirely\r\ndifferent system, which succeeds admirably. These barns, located near\r\nthe grain fields, are constructed with strong frames. They are both tall\r\nand wide, and so anchored to their foundations as not to be overthrown\r\nby high winds. Each roof is supplied with a series of latticed\r\nventilators. In building the side walls, every alternate ten feet, was\r\nleft open from ground to roof. These open spaces were fitted with roller\r\nscreens of jointed, wooden slats, operated by weights and springs, which\r\nallowed the interior to be well lighted and thoroughly ventilated. These\r\nscreens could all be raised or lowered at pleasure. While the barns were\r\nbeing filled, they were all open.\r\n\r\n\"As the fields of grain commenced to ripen, while the straw was still\r\ngreen and full of sap, and the swollen kernels were just passing out of\r\nthe dough stage of maturing; with the aid of a large force of workers,\r\noperating improved machinery, entire fields of standing grain at just\r\nprecisely the proper stage of maturity, could be transferred to the\r\nshelter of these barns in a single day. As the heavy green bundles of\r\ngrain were delivered from the fields, to the adjustable elevators\r\nworking through the open spaces of the barns, from either side, these\r\nbundles were carried to the hands of the rick-builders, who piled them\r\ninto narrow ricks five feet in width, across the barn and up to the\r\nroof. As the ricks grew in height, strong wire screens were hooked to\r\nthe dividing posts which marked the boundaries of the ricks. These\r\nscreens kept the bundles in place, and the ricks securely upright. When\r\nthe barns were filled in this way, the ricks were separated by four feet\r\nof open space, with a ventilator in the roof for each pair of ricks and\r\nspaces.\r\n\r\n\"When the grain crops were thus housed without waste from shelling, the\r\ncuring process went forward swiftly and securely. The advantages gained,\r\nwere many. The wheat straw, full of sap when harvested, in curing\r\nslowly, kept the plump kernels of grain from shrinking, while it left\r\nthem with clear, smooth, thin skins, and a quality, which produced less\r\nbran and more gluten, in the flour they would yield when ground. The\r\nkernels were all more uniform in size, larger, firmer and fairer; would\r\nall grade as number one. No sprouted wheat! No must! No blight! No rust!\r\n\r\n\"This was also true of oats and barley. The straw came from the improved\r\nthreshers, in straight, compact bundles, thoroughly freed from grain,\r\nfragrant and bright, almost as nutritious for forage as hay. In fact,\r\nthis straw, in such excellent shape for cutting, feeding, storing, or\r\ntransportation, possessed more than twice the selling value of the best\r\nof ordinary straw. The oat straw, being softer and more pliable, was\r\nstill more valuable as forage. The barley straw, less desirable for\r\nstock food, was sent to the paper mill for the use of the box factory.\r\nBy this method of harvesting and curing grain, the increase in quality\r\nand selling value, was largely augmented. The general result was a\r\nmarked saving of grain, time, labor and money.\r\n\r\n\"In cutting and curing the hay crops, the same kind of barns were used.\r\nThe loosely packed hay in the tall, thin ricks, was soon dry enough to\r\nbale, and then be transferred to the storing barns; leaving room for the\r\ncorn crop which was to follow. Hay cured in this way is superior to\r\nanything on the market, and always brings tip-top prices!\r\n\r\n\"In curing corn, more time and wider ricks are necessary. The corn could\r\nbe cut earlier, thus leaving the ground free to be prepared for the\r\nsucceeding crop of fall wheat or late vegetables. During stormy weather,\r\nafter this slower curing process was complete, a jolly army of huskers\r\ninvaded the barns. The ripe corn, free from husk, was carefully assorted\r\nand stored in the ventilated bins prepared for it. The selected husks\r\nwere packed and baled, ready for market. The stalks were stripped and\r\ntopped by a clever machine. The excellent forage thus accumulated, was\r\nbaled and stored. The pith in the large part of the stalk, was then\r\nextracted by another machine. These piths were then treated to a\r\nwater-proofing process, sent to a shop on the farm, and made up into\r\nlife preservers. Both life preservers and life rafts, made from pith\r\ntreated in this way, proved lighter, cheaper, and more buoyant than\r\nthose made from cork. This, you will observe is another profitable\r\nindustry, added to the financial resources of Solaris. It is also an\r\naddition to the fitting employments for women.\r\n\r\n\"A still more desirable employment for our women co-operators, was found\r\nat the grain mill, where wheat, oats, and barley were transformed into\r\npopular brands of 'Solaris Breakfast Food.' Thus prepared, the market\r\nvalue of a bushel of grain was increased four fold.\r\n\r\n\"A new food preparation, from a mixture of pop-corn with equal parts of\r\nthoroughly ground, roasted sweet corn, is really an excellent article of\r\ndiet. In small, neat packages, this healthy and attractive food can be\r\nsold at a large profit.\r\n\r\n\"All of these sources of profit, naturally grow out of the new methods\r\nof harvesting and housing grain, which is made possible by the curing\r\nbarns. While in appearance, these barns may not prove attractive, yet, I\r\nthink you will readily acknowledge that they are very useful buildings;\r\nbuildings which Solaris could not well do without.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really! Fillmore, I think these buildings are very fine! More than\r\nthat, they are wonderfully well adapted to the purpose for which they\r\nwere constructed! In this respect they certainly excel in usefulness,\r\nall other classes of barns. In your description of them, and of the new\r\nmethods in harvesting; I have been as much interested and entertained as\r\nthough you were relating some fascinating romance. Indeed, I have been\r\nso absorbed, that I fear my poor note-book has been sadly neglected!\r\n\r\n\"How much land do you devote to cotton growing? How has co-operative\r\nmethods, affected its culture as a paying crop?\"\r\n\r\n\"Last year, we planted twelve hundred acres in cotton. By the use of\r\nchoice seed, a weedless soil, improved methods in the destruction of\r\ninsect enemies, a better selection of fibre-producing fertilizers, a\r\nless wasteful plan of planting, and a more careful culture, we have\r\nincreased the yield per acre from 300 to 500, and in a few instances to\r\n550 pounds. When the crop was picked and ginned, we had twelve hundred\r\nbales of fine cotton. The quality of the fibre in the whole lot, was so\r\nexcellent and so uniformly well ripened, that we were offered two cents\r\nper pound above the ruling price of ordinary cotton. As a result, this\r\none crop gave the farm a cash income of $65,000. $60,000 for the fibre,\r\nand $5,000 for the seed, oil and oil cake. Choice seed for planting, was\r\na large item in the last named amount.\r\n\r\n\"Heretofore, the great difficulty experienced by single farmers in\r\ngrowing large crops of cotton, has arisen from the want of sufficient\r\nhelp during the picking season. At Solaris, we always have an abundance\r\nof help. If the needs of the work seem to demand it, we can put two\r\nsix-hour reliefs of pickers into the field each day, with 200 pickers in\r\neach relief. By working such a force, a large crop can soon be gathered\r\nwithout waste or damage. The pickers, all receiving the same daily\r\nwages, have a pocket interest in saving the cotton, therefore clean,\r\ncareful picking, with a view of preserving a high grade of fibre, soon\r\nbecomes the rule. This is an important matter, as green, immature fibre\r\nis worthless for the purpose of making a strong, durable thread or\r\nfabric; therefore pickers must be sufficiently intelligent, to\r\nunderstand why they should select only the thoroughly ripened cotton.\r\n\r\n\"Care is taken to make the pickers as comfortable as possible. For this\r\npurpose, broad, movable awnings, are provided to protect them from sun\r\nand showers. Under such circumstances, the picking season becomes one of\r\nfun and frolic, to which our co-operators, look forward with rejoicing.\r\nSix hours in each day spent in such light, pleasant work, is hardly\r\nregarded as toil. Yet, the amount of cotton picked by each individual,\r\nmeasured by the number of hours employed, is fully up to the standard\r\nset by good pickers, under the old system of long hours. The\r\nnimble-fingered women easily bear off the palm, as the expert pickers.\r\nIf they were paid by the pound, their earnings would be greater than\r\nthose of the men. Judged by such practical work, women cannot much\r\nlonger be classed with the weaker units of an agricultural colony!\"\r\n\r\n\"I consider that, as a very important point, well stated! But pardon me\r\nFillmore, for the question! You spoke of better methods for the\r\ndestruction of insect enemies. What are those insects, and how did you\r\nmanage to destroy them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those that proved the most troublesome, were the cut-worm and\r\nboll-worm. Both were hatched from the eggs laid by certain kinds of\r\nmoths. During the nights of the egg-laying season, for these moths, they\r\nwere easily trapped and destroyed. By the use of a large number of\r\nelectric light traps, suspended from convenient wires, thousands of\r\nthese insects were lured to destruction before they could deposit their\r\neggs. We are encouraged to believe, that a few years of such wholesale\r\nextermination, will soon rid us of these pests altogether.\r\n\r\n\"With a view of securing a continuous improvement in the quality of the\r\ncotton, we propose during the next five years, to carefully select the\r\nseed for each successive planting, from the largest, most prolific\r\nstalks, that produce the finest fibre. Reasoning from past experience, I\r\nthink it will not be difficult to obtain a yield at least one-third\r\ngreater than that of last year; which, on account of extra-superior\r\nquality, will readily sell for a still higher price. A careful reading\r\nof the annual reports, made by our consuls, who are stationed at the\r\nprincipal commercial ports of the world, has taught us, that to sell\r\nwell, American cotton must be baled to meet the requirements of foreign\r\nmarkets. These markets demand that we must use a finer, better quality\r\nof baling burlaps, that will enable us to make closer, stronger,\r\nsmoother packages, such as will at once impress the prospective buyer\r\nwith the fact that they are really fine, because in appearance they are\r\nso tight, tidy, and attractive. To secure this, a small additional\r\nexpense for baling material, is money well spent.\r\n\r\n\"Considering cotton as a cash crop, our experience so far, proves it to\r\nbe especially adapted to the needs and methods of co-operative farming.\r\nA single crop has put money enough into our treasury, to pay more than\r\ndouble the purchase price of this farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"From your very clear and comprehensive answers to my questions, it\r\nappears that a co-operative farm, by reason of the number and\r\norganization of its workers, is equipped to carry on the culture of\r\ncotton with more than ordinary profit. This I accept as being absolutely\r\ntrue! Therefore I hail your success as a revelation of new\r\npossibilities, which must surely follow in the near future!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCUSSION GROWS MORE INTERESTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Now Fillmore,\" said Fern, \"I wish to ask, what have you been doing in\r\nthe department of experimental farming?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much of the work in that department is still in such a preliminary\r\nstage, that definite results cannot yet be declared. However, among the\r\nexperiments worthy of mention, are the fields containing the various\r\nkinds of true sugar cane, and of sorghum or Chinese sugar cane.\r\n\r\n\"By hybridizing and other methods, we are striving to increase the\r\nhardiness of the former and the crystallizing-sugar product of the\r\nlatter. By the results already obtained we are encouraged to believe,\r\nthat five years hence, we shall have produced a sugar-cane equal to the\r\nbest, that may be grown with much profit, as far north as St. Louis.\r\n\r\n\"Small plots of ground have also been devoted to growing tea, peppers,\r\nsage, hops, ginseng and other medicinal plants, with such excellent\r\nresults, that no doubt they will soon develop into profitable ventures.\r\n\r\n\"The ten acres planted to broom-corn, have produced the necessary\r\nmaterial with which to keep the workers in the broom and brush factory\r\nprofitably employed.\r\n\r\n\"In the line of fibre plants, other than the cotton crop before\r\nmentioned; we have grown enough hemp and flax, to supply the needs of\r\nour rope and twine works. In 'bromelia fibrista,' a new fibre plant, we\r\nfind a product that bids fair to rival silk in producing a fabric of\r\nfine, smooth, beautiful texture.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the foregoing, several swampy plots have been planted to\r\nwillow, and as a consequence, a growing basket-weaving industry has been\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\"At the very beginning of our work here, while I was preparing to stock\r\nthe seed beds in the nursery, one of our co-operators, a very\r\nintelligent and observing young man, who had been railroading in Mexico\r\nfor two years previous to his joining our colony, called my attention to\r\nthe Mexican quince. So strongly did he assert his belief that the fruit\r\nwould thrive at Solaris, that I soon became a convert to his enthusiasm.\r\nWith the young man for a guide, two weeks later we were on the way to\r\nMexico; returning shortly, with enough three-year-old nursery stock, to\r\nplant one hundred acres. In addition, we secured the seed for 500,000\r\nyoung plants. Since that time, our plantation of quince bushes has grown\r\nfinely.\r\n\r\n\"Last year we gathered the first crop. Not a large one--perhaps, from\r\nfifteen to twenty-five quinces from each clump of bushes. As the fruit\r\nwas large and the bushes thickly planted, the yield was about one\r\nhundred crates to the acre. An aggregate of ten thousand crates for the\r\nentire crop. We have every reason to believe, that the crop this year\r\nwill be double that amount.\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the fact that this quince thrives best on the elevated table\r\nlands of Mexico, where it is subject to periods of cold and frost of\r\nconsiderable length; it has readily adjusted itself to this location and\r\nclimate. We are now able to pronounce it, a complete success! It is a\r\nmagnificent fruit! Much superior in size, color, flavor and fragrance,\r\nto our own domestic quince. In keeping qualities and a firmness of flesh\r\nthat will bear long distance transportation without injury, it is fully\r\nequal to the northern quince. In a deep-toned richness of color,\r\nperfection of shape and smoothness of skin, these peerless quinces are\r\nveritable apples of gold! They are pictures of beauty which sell at\r\nsight! The flavor is so fine, that Mexicans eat them with as much relish\r\nas the people of New York eat apples. Dried, these quinces are\r\ndelicious!\r\n\r\n\"In Mexico, large quantities are annually reduced to a soft mass of\r\npulp, spread out in thin layers, and dried into sheets of what is termed\r\nquince-leather. Armed with a generous roll of this excellent\r\npreparation, the traveler in the desert countries of hot, dry climates,\r\nmay bid defiance to thirst. With such a wealth of recommendations, we\r\nwere able to sell our first crop of quinces at a net price of two\r\ndollars per crate; or $20,000 in cash. Hereafter we shall save the\r\ncommissions, as we have already received advance orders for our next\r\ncrop, at $2.25 per crate, delivered on board the cars here at Solaris.\r\nNext year, we propose to enlarge our quince orchard by adding another\r\nhundred acres. Taking all these items into consideration, I think we\r\nhave good reason to be proud of our first attempt at experimental\r\nfarming in the line of quince culture!\r\n\r\n\"I have two additional experiments to describe. They are the last on my\r\nlist.\r\n\r\n\"While in Mexico securing the quince plants, I found what to me was a\r\nnew variety of table grapes. They were marked by the following\r\ncharacteristics. Large clusters, berry large oblong, thin skin, few\r\nseeds, fine sweet pulp, delicious bouquet, color when ripe, a pale\r\namber green; ripens about the first of July. As we found these grapes\r\ngrowing on the high table lands, I determined to try them at Solaris. By\r\nthe dint of hard work, I procured enough young vines to set fifty acres.\r\nFrom those vines, we have rooted enough cuttings in the nursery, to give\r\nus 100,000 young vines, which have now reached the proper size for\r\nsetting in the vineyard. This fine grape we have named 'Solaris Early.'\r\n\r\n\"Last July we gathered our first crop--5000 ten-pound baskets, which we\r\nreadily sold at the fancy wholesale price of one dollar per basket. In\r\npacking them for the market we carefully reject small, poor bunches. The\r\nbunches selected are freed from all bruised berries. The stems of the\r\nbunches are then dipped in melted wax. After this treatment they are\r\npacked in layers of finely cut, soft chaff, made from clean, bright,\r\nfragrant oat straw. The chaff serves to keep the berries and clusters\r\nwell apart, and also to keep out the air, which otherwise would soon\r\nwilt the fruit. Packed in this way the grapes reach distant markets in\r\nperfect condition. In fact, they are the only good table grapes on the\r\nmarket at that season; therefore in choice lots they will always command\r\nfancy prices. The experiment with them has proved so successful that\r\nnext season, we shall increase the size of the vineyard to two hundred\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n\"By way of a commencement in small fruit culture, we have fifty acres of\r\nground, devoted to growing a great variety of berries. They require the\r\nwork of a large number of hands during the picking season. Owing to the\r\nperishable nature of such small fruits, we do not attempt to market them\r\nfresh, but make them into jellies, jams, marmalades, and preserves.\r\nThese we pack in glass jars, of the various sizes demanded by the\r\nwholesale and retail trade. In preparing and packing these goods, we use\r\nonly the best of everything. This is in line with our purpose to\r\nestablish a reputation of a high degree of excellence, for each article\r\nput on the market under a Solaris label. By a rigid observance of this\r\nrule, we manage to sell the products of our berry crops at a good\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\"When the farm books are balanced at the end of the year, we are\r\nencouraged to find that the fifty acres of berries, has a larger credit\r\nthan any other fifty acres on the farm.\r\n\r\n\"In the line of an extension of this kind of farming, we are now\r\npreparing for next year, with the purpose of starting a factory for\r\ncanning our output of sweet corn, green peas, beans, asparagus,\r\ntomatoes, peaches, plums and pears. This completes my list of items\r\nunder the head of experimental farming, which Solaris now has to offer.\r\nWhat do you think of it so far?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think very well of it indeed! I am especially impressed with the\r\nMexican quinces, early grapes, and the berries. They seem to promise the\r\ngreatest success, and the largest financial returns. Taken altogether, I\r\nthink the outlook for experimental farming at Solaris, is very bright!\r\n\r\n\"Now, by the way of recapitulation, can you give to me, a brief\r\nstatement of the crops grown last year; with an approximate one, of the\r\ncash derived therefrom?\"\r\n\r\n\"That will not be difficult. I will endeavor to make my statement as\r\nbrief as possible.\r\n\r\n\"By looking at this map, you will observe that during the season just\r\npast, we have cultivated about 4,000 acres of land. The crops planted,\r\nwere nearly as follows: 1,200 acres to cotton; 1,000 acres to wheat;\r\n1,100 acres divided between corn, oats, barley and hay; 150 acres to\r\nvegetables, and 550 acres to a miscellaneous variety of crops, such as\r\nthe nursery, the quince orchard, the vineyard, the berries, the gardens,\r\nand all ground devoted to experimental culture.\r\n\r\n\"The aggregate cash income derived from these crops, which found a\r\nmarket in the outside world, in addition to those sold to our own\r\npeople, amounted in round numbers to $193,000. Of this amount, $95,000\r\ncame from sales of cotton and wheat. Next year we have good reason to\r\nexpect a cash income of $250,000 from our farm products alone. Last year\r\nwe realized $57,000 from the sale of our manufactured products; such as\r\nbrick, terracotta, drain pipes, tiles, earthen ware, furniture, brooms,\r\nwillow ware, and the output of several other minor industries. This\r\nbrought the total income of the farm for the year, up to $250,000.\r\n\r\n\"You ask what disposition has been made of this money? $50,000 has been\r\nexpended in additional improvements, machinery, buildings, and live\r\nstock for the farm. $25,000 more, has been added to the stock in our\r\nstore, which now has a supply of goods, sufficient to meet the demands\r\nof adjacent settlers who wish to trade with us. $25,000 is held in our\r\ntreasury, for use in any emergency which may arise. The remaining\r\n$150,000, has been placed in the sinking-fund.\r\n\r\n\"Our farm-store, has proved a very important institution. The clothing,\r\ntailoring, dressmaking and millinery departments, have proved\r\nsurprisingly successful; with a constantly increasing demand for the\r\ngoods turned out. This opens a wide field of remunerative labor, for our\r\nwomen co-operators.\r\n\r\n\"The 2,400 acres of untilled lands, are now utilized as follows: 500\r\nacres are covered by a fairly good native forest; 500 more, by the\r\nscattered timber around the stone quarries, gravel beds, sand pits, clay\r\ndeposits and the various other mines. 400 acres are used for pasture,\r\n100 acres belong to the village site. 200 acres are planted to apple\r\ntrees; 25 acres to pear; 25 acres to peach; and 200 acres to nut-bearing\r\ntrees. 100 acres are now being prepared for the addition to the quince\r\norchard. Another 100 acres for the vineyard. The remaining 250 acres,\r\nfor other desirable varieties of fruit.\r\n\r\n\"Of the 100 acres set apart for the village site, only forty, are at\r\npresent occupied by the streets in use, the buildings, and the public\r\nsquare. The remaining sixty acres, are laid out with walks, drives,\r\nlawns, oval, circular, and star-shaped plots. The latter, are filled\r\nwith choice roses and flowers. The ovals and circles, are thickly\r\nplanted with fruit trees and ornamental shrubbery. The fruits, such as\r\ncherries, plums, peaches, pears and figs, have all been the result of\r\nexperimental potting and planting by the school children. The same is\r\ntrue in a large measure, of the rose gardens and the shrubbery.\r\n\r\n\"The effect of this amusing work on the children, is most excellent. A\r\ntaste for the beautiful becomes permanent, while they acquire a fund of\r\nuseful knowledge about the care and culture of trees, and also how to\r\nenjoy themselves in the conscious zeal of pushing forward some useful\r\nemployment; which will make them stronger, healthier and happier. With\r\nthe advent of spring, comes a wealth of bloom to reward their toil--a\r\nparadise of beauty and fragrance; everywhere, clouds of pink sprays and\r\nsnowy petals charm the sight.\r\n\r\n\"This last item, like a long, ornamental flourish, must conclude my\r\nsumming up of the distribution of crops, the division of forest, pasture\r\nand fruit lands, over the whole farm; with its complete chain of\r\nfinancial resources, and its outlook for the coming season. I hope I\r\nhave not made my recapitulation too lengthy! Also, that I have succeeded\r\nin answering your questions satisfactorily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your summing up has shown surprising results! The magnitude of the cash\r\nincome, is really a crown of triumph for co-operative farming! I\r\ncongratulate you, and the people of Solaris, most heartily! In justice\r\nto the able answers to my questions, I must say that many times you have\r\nanswered, even before I could frame them into words. With each\r\nsucceeding reply, my wonder and delight has increased. I have discovered\r\nmany new possibilities, in pleasant, productive and profitable methods\r\nfor farm work, of which I have never before dreamed. Now that you have\r\nmade them plain to me in such a charming manner; I am beginning to\r\nunderstand how it is, that Solaris can produce such quantities of\r\nmarketable goods, that can so easily be turned into cash. I have yet a\r\nnumber of important questions remaining unanswered, but they do not\r\npertain to growing crops.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL SOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I now wish,\" said Fern, \"to consider the social and domestic interests\r\nof the colony. How do you manage to keep up the necessary degree of\r\ncleanliness, demanded by perfect sanitation in the living rooms of the\r\nco-operators, without seriously disturbing the privacy of the family.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a delicate matter, which by choice of the co-operators\r\nthemselves, easily adjusts itself to the requirements of the committee\r\nmembers, who are chosen to take charge of the tri-weekly scrubbing and\r\nsweeping. The detail for this work for each week, is made by the\r\nassignment committee.\r\n\r\n\"They select from a class of workers, known as both skillful and\r\ntrustworthy. All rooms which the occupants desire to have cleaned, are\r\nleft open. All rooms that are found locked, are reported to the chairman\r\nof the committee, whose duty it is to inspect them at a later period,\r\nwhile the occupants are present. It is a matter which is well understood\r\nby the members of the company, that rooms not accessible to the regular\r\ncleaning force, must be kept sweet and tidy by the occupants themselves,\r\nduring hours which might be otherwise devoted to rest, amusement or\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\"Under the pressure of such conditions, even the most exclusive, soon\r\nvoluntarily open all their rooms to the authorized force. Causes for\r\ncomplaint against any member of the sanitary, inspection or assignment\r\ncommittee, are corrected by the voters at monthly elections, held for\r\nthe purpose of selecting new committees. This system so appeals to that\r\ninnate sense of justice and harmony reigning in the hearts of our\r\npeople, that after a few months of experience, they are ready to\r\nco-operate heartily in any sort of discipline which may be necessary to\r\nsecure the welfare of the entire colony.\r\n\r\n\"The peculiar charm of colony-life appeals to them so strongly, that to\r\nbe voted out of the organization on account of violation of rules, or of\r\nany improper conduct, is universally considered as a most dreadful\r\ncalamity. The possibility of such a fate, like some hidden spectre, acts\r\nas a restraining influence, which holds in check the most lawless,\r\nstubborn, or self-opinionated. It soon makes them zealous, peace-loving\r\nand obedient. Having once tasted the sweets of the co-operative system,\r\nthey have a wholesome dread of being obliged to return to the cruel\r\nbitterness of the old competitive system!\r\n\r\n\"Among the most potent charms which have proved so attractive to Solaris\r\nworkers, is the condition of health, comfort and beauty, which surrounds\r\nthe laborer in every department of the farm.\r\n\r\n\"In store, work-shop, seed-room, dairy, mill, factory or packing-house,\r\nthe rooms are large, the light is abundant, ventilation perfect,\r\nceilings high; while both walls and ceilings are so beautifully and\r\nartistically decorated, that love for the beautiful in the esthetic\r\nnature, swells and grows to be a dominant passion. This passion soon\r\ntakes hold of both heart and brain, becoming the foundation of a\r\ncharacter-building-work of high order. Thus happily environed, our\r\npeople feast their eyes and merrily sing away the hours, which are\r\ndevoted to tasks they have learned to love. The tendency of these\r\nthings, is ever toward the good, the right, the pure and true! Under\r\nsuch conditions, the demon of discontent, evil thinking and evil doing,\r\ncannot thrive! His power wanes, he flies to the more congenial\r\nsurroundings which mark the dingy, ill smelling, overcrowded work-shops\r\nof the competitive system!\r\n\r\n\"No wonder, when away from Solaris, our people are so anxious to return!\r\nThey come back convinced, that they have fortunately escaped from the\r\nthralldom of a debasing, cruel system. A system which--utterly ignoring\r\nthe sacredness of human life--in a frenzy of selfish greed, has, so far\r\nas the toilers of the world are concerned, turned the triumphs of modern\r\ncivilization into the mockery of a bitter curse! As affecting\r\nthemselves, our people perceive that, under the protecting mantle of\r\nfinancial conditions which prevail here at Solaris, they, as members of\r\nthe company, are sure to secure every benefit, profit or advantage, that\r\nmay flow from the use of the best and most expensive kinds of\r\nlabor-saving machinery. Once aware of all the facts, thereafter, they\r\ncannot under any circumstances, be induced to return to employment under\r\nthe old system.\r\n\r\n\"The advantage in favor of co-operative work is so great, that among our\r\nwomen co-operators, there is a general desire to have it utilized to the\r\nutmost; especially in all kinds of housework. The introduction of such a\r\nwholesale system of house-cleaning, soon demands a better class of\r\nsweepers, to take the place of the housewife's broom and dust pan.\r\n\r\n\"Large suction sweepers, worked by a powerful inhaling bellows, which\r\nswiftly and silently suck up, from carpet, furniture, and curtains, all\r\nparticles of accumulated dust, are the perfected instruments chosen;\r\nunlike the ordinary dust-raising machines, which must be followed by an\r\narmy of dusting cloths, these suction machines do perfect work, leaving\r\nthe air of the renovated room pure, wholesome and fairly free from\r\nfloating dust, with its accompanying cloud of disease-laden germs. Many\r\nsimilar accomplishments in other departments of housework, soon convince\r\nall opponents, that personal prejudice must not be allowed to interfere\r\nwith the working of the system.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me Fillmore! If at this point I interrupt you, with a question\r\nwhich I wish to preface with this remark! In the estimation of most\r\nwomen, well-kept hands, are considered as a rule, to indicate the\r\nmeasure of the owners refinement. According to my judgment, there is\r\nnothing which so quickly destroys the contour and suppleness of the\r\nhands, and that much prized, white, velvety smoothness of skin, as\r\ndishwashing. As a matter of fact, the woman's self-respect is involved\r\nin the loss. For this reason, I believe women dislike that disagreeable\r\npart of housework more than any other. Premising that my theory is true,\r\nhow can you manage this matter at Solaris, in order to avoid trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept your question as a welcome interruption! It gives me a chance\r\nto tell you more about our kitchen work, which I feel sure will interest\r\nyou greatly!\r\n\r\n\"For reasons which I shall state presently, our women workers do not\r\ndesire to avoid frequent six-hour details as dishwashers at the\r\nrestaurant. By our new methods, the task is easily and quickly\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\"The washers are not required to put their hands into hot or cold water\r\nduring the process. Traveling carriers on either side of the dining\r\nrooms, run to and from the kitchen. In one, the food comes to the\r\ntables, in response to phone orders from the waiter. In the other, the\r\ndishes are returned to the kitchen. There, the washers scrape the bones\r\nand rejected food into the waiting barrels. These barrels when filled,\r\ngo to the feeding yards of the pigs and poultry.\r\n\r\n\"The dishes, after being scraped, are then placed in the washing\r\nmachine. This machine, run by electric power, is a wide, deep,\r\nround-bottomed trough, built in a circle twenty feet in diameter. Along\r\nthe bottom of this trough, is a moving track, which travels slowly\r\naround the circle with its train of metal carriers. On these carriers\r\nare placed the dishes as they come from the hands of the scrapers. When\r\nthe carrier thus laden commences its circular journey, the\r\ndishes--placed well apart--are subjected to dashing jets of warm, soapy\r\nwater, and then to more torrential jets of hot, and very hot pure water.\r\n\r\n\"Comfortably seated, at convenient points around the machine, the\r\nwashers control the force and quantity of the water jets, and whenever\r\nnecessary, assist the cleansing process with their long-handled swabs.\r\nWhen this process is finished, the dishes arrive at the drying boards,\r\nso hot that by the time the wipers with their thick towels have placed\r\nthem in the racks where they belong, all are perfectly clean and dry.\r\n\r\n\"Our pots, sauce pans, stew pans and kettles, are all designed for\r\nelectric cooking, and are made in shapes best adapted for easy cleaning.\r\nFor these, an additional washing-sink is provided. Over this sink,\r\nconnected with the electric wires, we have rigged three hanging\r\nspindles, of as many different sizes. These spindles can be raised or\r\nlowered by the operator, while they are in motion. Each spindle is\r\narmed on every side with loose wings of alternating wire scrapers and\r\ndish-cloths. The vessel to be cleansed is placed on the movable carrier\r\nat the bottom of the sink. Passing under a spindle of the proper size,\r\nthe spindle is lowered, and at once begins to revolve with a strong,\r\nrotary pressure. This searching, chafing pressure, in connection with\r\nthe hot-water jets, soon cleans and polishes the most obstinate among\r\nthe kettles.\r\n\r\n\"The kitchen and dish pantry combined, is a very large, well-lighted,\r\nwell-ventilated room. This room is constantly kept sweet and comfortable\r\nby electric fans. The work is light, and never monotonous. Only two, of\r\nthe six hours devoted to kitchen duty, are spent in the active work of\r\ndish washing. During the remaining hours, the washers take lessons in\r\ncookery, from the chief and the two assistants. These three important\r\nofficials, are chosen from the ranks of competent volunteers. They are\r\nresponsible for the kitchen work. They plan all the meals, and direct\r\nthe work of the under cooks. The system soon comes to work like a charm!\r\nI can truthfully say, that it gives general satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"The success attending this extension of co-operative methods, to\r\nembrace the entire list of worry-producing details which belong to\r\ngeneral house work, is hailed with delight by our matrons and maidens.\r\nThey keenly appreciate the great blessing of this movement, which has\r\nrescued them from the harassing, health-destroying drudgery, of a house\r\nwife on a small farm. They well know the sad story, which comes from\r\nthousands of such farms, where isolated lives, overburden of cares and\r\nlong hours of irritating, never-ending toil, have produced such fearful,\r\nmental depression, that as a result, we find six hundred farmers' wives,\r\namong the inmates of asylums for the insane, in each one of the States\r\nof Michigan and Kansas. The proportion for other agricultural States, is\r\ndoubtless much the same. What a horrible array of statistics, this is to\r\ncontemplate! What an indictment against existing agricultural\r\nconditions! What a sad fate, to overtake the mothers of so many sons and\r\ndaughters of the farms of this Republic! Who can measure the intensity\r\nof the agony and suffering, these children may thus inherit! What\r\npossible argument, can speak more eloquently, or call more loudly, for\r\nthe immediate adoption of co-operative farming by our agricultural\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of frequent bathing to maintain personal cleanliness; the\r\npopularity, with both old and young, of our fine hot and cold, plunge,\r\nswimming and shower baths, free to all, which are kept open in\r\nconnection with the laundry; proves conclusively, that the habit of\r\ncleanliness, like all other habits, is the result of environment; or in\r\nother words, of opportunity and the strong impulse of social example.\r\n\r\n\"In treating your question as though it contained several sub-divisions,\r\nI may perhaps have made my answer too lengthy. Do you find it so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no! On the contrary it is clear, brief, interesting and to the\r\npoint! You have told me just what I most desired to know! I perceive\r\nthat the practical working of a co-operative colony, answers a great\r\nmany puzzling questions, which hitherto, we have passed by as hopeless\r\nproblems. From the commencement of this work, I have been concerned,\r\nlest the discipline necessary to maintain a proper working harmony in\r\nsuch a large colony, should prove a fruitful source of discontent. I am\r\nrejoiced to find that my fears were groundless!\r\n\r\n\"This brings me to my second question. Do you find homesickness among\r\nthe colonists, a frequent cause of discontent?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, the number of such cases has been surprisingly small.\r\nOwing, doubtless, to the marked change from isolated conditions of small\r\nfarm life, to the superior advantages for education, amusement, social\r\nenjoyment, and the all-pervading enthusiasm of congenial, co-operative\r\nwork; which here at Solaris, leaves no time for such fits of brooding\r\nover the past, as usually result in that severe mental depression, which\r\nwe call homesickness. Perhaps one individual in fifty, is so constituted\r\nthat homesickness becomes a serious illness. In such cases, the\r\nexecutive committee is authorized to grant the necessary leave of\r\nabsence. Always providing of course, that the applicant is willing to\r\ncomply with a rule of the organization, which assigns the pay of the\r\nabsentee to the general service fund, for the number of days such\r\nabsence may continue. A strict observance of this rule, leaves no cause\r\nfor complaint by those who remain.\r\n\r\n\"In considering the question from another standpoint, we find the\r\ngeneral tone and disposition of our people, has been raised to a much\r\nhigher, happier pitch, by the evolution of the musical spirit,\r\nintroduced and inspired by the work of the dancing and musical clubs.\r\nStimulated by the prizes offered by the general manager, a great number\r\nof beautiful farm songs have been completed, and adapted to a large\r\nvariety of farm work. These songs have been taken up by a goodly number\r\nof glee clubs, organized for the purpose from among those members of the\r\nmusical club, who had the good fortune to possess a fine quality of\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Careful training and steady practice, soon enabled these lesser vocal\r\norganizations, to render the entire list of songs, with a mellow\r\nsmoothness, an inspiring swing of rythm, and a well rounded tone of\r\nperfection, which was really quite surprising. These vocalists,\r\nscattered through the fifties and hundreds of farm workers in the hay,\r\nharvest, corn and cotton fields; the nursery, gardens, orchards and\r\nvineyards; the dairy, mills, factories and packing-houses; the brick\r\nworks, mines and quarries; the workshops of the store, and the assembly\r\nmeetings of the co-operators; became competent teachers, who, by their\r\nleadership and example, soon made it possible for every member of the\r\ncolony, to master both words and music of all the songs. This course of\r\nvocal training proved so fascinating, that our people literally absorbed\r\nit! The children, even more quickly than the adults!\r\n\r\n\"Thoroughly tested in the practical work of every department of the\r\nfarm; the beneficial effect has proved a marvel, which has far exceeded\r\nthe expectations of our musical enthusiasts. Many fine voices have been\r\ndiscovered, developed and trained. The benign influence of this musical\r\nwave, has shown a constant tendency to extend its sway in all\r\ndirections. This blending of voices, has added a hitherto unknown zest\r\nto the work; and a stronger tie to every association connected with it.\r\nBest of all, as directly affecting the question under discussion! It has\r\nproved a most potent factor in driving away the spirit of ill-humor,\r\ninharmony, and discontent; also in breaking the charm of old\r\nassociations, home ties, and retrospective, social memories, so\r\nconducive to attacks of homesickness. The exhilarating, helpful rythm,\r\nof these inspiring songs, has given an added force to the working power\r\nof the farm. It has largely reduced the fatigue, and increased the\r\namount of work that can be performed in a given time. Further, we find\r\nthe general mental, physical and spiritual health of our people,\r\ncorrespondingly improved.\r\n\r\n\"A curious fact, is disclosed by these vocal experiments. It is this,\r\nthat the vibration of musical tones, in the blending voices of a mixed\r\nmultitude, produces a moral, mental and spiritual harmony, such as\r\ncannot be achieved in any other way. In point of fact, we get a\r\ncomposite expression of the highest soul element of the mass--a new\r\nphase of the exceeding fruitfulness of co-operative effort! It may be\r\nstated in conclusion, that there comes to the minds of our people, an\r\nadded power, flowing from the general hypnotic effect, of harmonious\r\nco-operation. This power brings with it a right conception of human\r\nlife, in which a certain amount of necessary, productive labor, becomes\r\nthe keynote, which completes a perfect anthem, and more symmetrically\r\nrounds out the full measure, melody and grandeur, of an individual\r\nexistence. What think you of these results?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are very wonderful indeed! They reflect much credit on the\r\nexcellent work inspired by the dancing and musical clubs; also on the\r\ngenius and culture of the vocalists, and the marvelous efficiency of a\r\nwell-directed co-operative effort. This triumph in a new field, which so\r\nincreases the possibilities of soul expression, suggests the use of\r\nmusic as a prime factor in all future systems for ethical culture.\r\n\r\n\"Now Fillmore, please tell me. How has the example of Solaris farm,\r\naffected the industrial, social, and political situation in this town\r\nand county?\"\r\n\r\n\"The effect has been favorable in every way! The attractiveness of our\r\nsocial organization! the financial success which has crowned our farming\r\nand manufacturing operations; the opportunities offered for young men to\r\nlearn so much of the industrial arts; the short hours of light labor;\r\nthe long hours of leisure for rest, study and amusement; the\r\neducational, health-giving character, of the amusements; the\r\nfascination, of the club-system of education for adults; the\r\nirresistible charm, of the dancing and vocal entertainments; the\r\ngenerous wages paid to the co-operators, which affords for them such an\r\nabundant supply of food, clothing and books; the fine quality and\r\nperfect reliability of the large assortment of goods in the farm-store;\r\nthe advantages of a rational scheme of insurance, which stands as an\r\nabsolute safe-guard against accidents, sickness and old-age; the\r\nimproved conditions for women, which largely relieves them from the\r\nirritating, nerve-destroying worry, of a constant burden of household\r\ncares; the fostering care for children, which insures for them ideal\r\nopportunities for birth, unfoldment and education; the manifest\r\nadvantage of farming on a scale large enough to allow the use of the\r\nlatest and best labor-saving machinery; the astonishing array of huge,\r\nmodern barns, storing, curing and packing houses; the wonderful\r\ncheapness and utility of the electric power; the long list of farm\r\nimplements, many of them especially invented, which followed the\r\nintroduction of this magic-working power; the wide publicity given to\r\nthese things through the columns of the Solaris Sentinel, our weekly\r\nfarm paper, sent free to friends of the colonists, and to all who ask\r\nfor it; considered altogether as a comprehensive whole, is a startling\r\ncombination, which has arrested the attention, aroused the interest and\r\nprovoked the astonishment of surrounding communities, far and near. As a\r\nconsequence, our office has been overwhelmed with a flood of\r\ncorrespondence from interested enquirers, followed by an ever-increasing\r\nstream of visitors to Solaris, to see for themselves, the verity of this\r\ntwentieth century model of farm innovation. In order to answer the great\r\nbulk of queries, emanating from these two sources, a series of articles\r\ndescribing the object and purpose, and explaining the details of the\r\nenterprise, has been prepared for the columns of the Sentinel. With an\r\nextra large edition of this newspaper, we are prepared to supply as many\r\ninterested people as may apply.\r\n\r\n\"The applications to join the company, made by progressive young farmers\r\nin this and adjacent counties, have become so frequent and persistent,\r\nthat finally we have consented to prepare the leaders for another\r\nco-operative colony, which we propose to locate on a certain one, of the\r\nnine remaining Fenwick-farm-sites, which happens to be in this county,\r\nonly ten miles distant from Solaris. This preparatory class, is limited\r\nto fifty people; one-half females, married couples ranging from eighteen\r\nto twenty-five years of age, preferred. The course for this class,\r\ncontemplates one year of practical work, embracing all departments of\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\n\"The membership of this class, was filled six months ago. Six months\r\nhence, the graduates will be prepared to organize the new colony. I am\r\ngreatly interested in the scheme, and have promised to aid in every\r\npossible way.\r\n\r\n\"To this body of pupils, is referred all applications from prospective\r\nco-operators. Judging from the mass of applications already accumulated,\r\nwhen the time of organization for the new colony arrives, the list of\r\neligible applicants will probably contain a thousand names. The outlook\r\nfor the new farm company, seems unusually bright!\r\n\r\n\"Both board and tuition for these pupils, are donated by Solaris Farm.\r\nAt the end of the year, $100 in Solaris scrip, will be paid to each one,\r\nas some sort of compensation for the year's work. This arrangement is\r\naccepted by the pupils, as fair and perfectly satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\"Referring to the relations existing between the Solaris Farm Company,\r\nand the township and county officials. It is noteworthy, that no serious\r\nfriction has arisen. One year ago, a large proportion of town officers,\r\nincluding the assessor, town clerk, magistrate and chairman of the Board\r\nof Supervisors, were chosen from Solaris. Owing to the small,\r\nmuch-scattered, population of this county, the present county sheriff,\r\nauditor and treasurer, are also Solaris co-operators. The manifest\r\nintegrity of this institution, seems to be accepted by the voters of the\r\ncounty, as a guarantee of the honesty and ability of its members. The\r\nsignificance of this approval, so early in the history of the movement,\r\naugurs well for the future dominancy of our social and industrial\r\nsystem, as a political factor in both town and county.\r\n\r\n\"The Solaris Company has erected a roomy, substantial building, for the\r\nuse of the town officials, for which a moderate rent is paid from the\r\ntown-treasury. The county officers have secured one hundred acres of\r\nland two miles from Solaris, just outside the farm limits. On this, they\r\npropose to erect a suitable brick building for the county offices. The\r\nfarm company, now has the contract to furnish the brick and erect the\r\nbuilding. Pending its completion, the county officials occupy rented\r\nquarters in Solaris, which is by far the largest business center in the\r\ncounty. From this statement of the situation, you will observe that our\r\nco-operative vote already holds a balance of power, which controls the\r\npolicy of both town and county. With the advent of Colony number 2, the\r\ninterests of co-operation in this county, are secure for all time.\r\nMeanwhile, we are encouraged to hope that before the close of the\r\ntwentieth century, what co-operation has already achieved at Solaris,\r\nmay be accomplished in every town, county and state in the Republic!\r\n\r\n\"You ask, what disposition is made of the salaries of such co-operators\r\nas are elected to fill town and county offices?\r\n\r\n\"They are paid in scrip. The salaries or fees which they receive from\r\ntown or county, are turned into the company treasury. As these\r\nco-operators, in holding such offices, are in a position to materially\r\naid the co-operative movement. They are justly excused from farm-work,\r\nwhenever their official duties require attention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid! my dear Fillmore! Your report is very interesting, and even\r\nmore encouraging! It seems the beginning of a fulfillment of my father's\r\nhopes, dreams and prophecies! I am anxious for the time to come, when he\r\ncan tell you how much he is pleased with your work!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nSOLARIS SCRIP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Returning again, Fillmore, to the financial operations of the farm;\r\nwith such a volume of business to transact, how do you manage to get\r\nalong without having recourse to some local bank?\"\r\n\r\n\"To a large extent, we do our own banking business. Our treasurer, has\r\nhis office in the cash room of the store. In this room we have a large\r\nvault, containing a fire-proof safe of the latest type. The books,\r\nrecords and funds of the company, are all kept in this safe. For our\r\ncommercial business, we have selected one of the principal banks of St.\r\nLouis as our bank of deposit. A large percentage of purchases for the\r\nstore and farm are made in that city, which is also a market for the\r\nbulk of our farm produce.\r\n\r\n\"The farm company has an office near the bank, where some member of the\r\nexecutive committee, or other representative of the company, may be\r\nfound every business day of the year. It is the duty of this agent to\r\nattend to purchases, consignments and sales; also to have charge of all\r\nbusiness transacted through the bank of deposit. Taking care, to keep\r\nthe amount of available funds up to the ten thousand dollar mark. To do\r\nthis, it sometimes becomes necessary for the company to issue drafts on\r\nthe bank of deposit for thirty, sixty and ninety days. These drafts are\r\naccepted by dealers, for purchases made in Chicago, Cincinnati,\r\nPhiladelphia or New York, the same as cash.\r\n\r\n\"As borrowers, our only dealings have been with you. In these dealings,\r\nat times when much in need of more capital, we have not been required to\r\npay interest. Now, having returned our borrowed capital, and being free\r\nfrom debt, we have grown more independent and self-sustaining; therefore\r\nmore averse to the idea of paying interest to any one. We are convinced\r\nby past experience, that all necessity for incurring interest-bearing\r\nobligations can be avoided. The use of Solaris Scrip in all\r\nintercolonial transactions, has proved a most potent factor in helping\r\nus to arrive at such a fortunate conclusion. By its use, ninety per cent\r\nof our business can be transacted on a cash basis, without using one\r\ncent of actual cash. In addition, we can use it as a basis on which to\r\nborrow. To illustrate! Suppose we need ten thousand dollars to replenish\r\nthe stock of goods in the store, pending the sale of products on hand.\r\nWe borrow that amount from the insurance fund, the sum being part of the\r\naccumulated profits on sales at the store and restaurant. We then\r\nreplace this sum by scrip of the same face value. This scrip, to the\r\npensioner or beneficiaries, is the same as cash. When they have drawn\r\nand spent it, the debt is cancelled. No interest is paid. The store and\r\nrestaurant become the clearing house, through which these drafts against\r\nthe resources of the farm are liquidated. In the same way, temporary\r\nloans can be made from other funds, whenever it is for the benefit of\r\nthe united interests of the co-operators to do so.\r\n\r\n\"How is it possible, you ask, to keep perfect control of such a large\r\nissue of scrip, with a certainty that all in use is genuine?\r\n\r\n\"That is a matter which is easily regulated by our simple system of\r\nissue. In the first place, we print the scrip here at Solaris, from\r\nplates which, when not in use, are kept in the safe, in the custody of\r\nthe treasurer. The five denominations issued, are as follows: five, two,\r\nand one dollar bills; which, together with the fifty and\r\ntwenty-five-cent, fractional-currency scrip, make up the list. Every\r\ndenomination has a numbered series, of ten thousand. Each series, with\r\nthe stubs attached to the bills, is bound in book form. When issued,\r\neach stub remaining in the book, will show the date of issue, serial\r\nnumber, and amount of the issued bill. When cancelled, the bills are\r\nreturned to the book, and again attached to the stub to which they\r\nbelong. At any time, an examination of the books of issued and unissued\r\nscrip in the hands of the treasurer, will give the amount outstanding.\r\nThe co-operators are requested to keep a record of the serial numbers of\r\nthe scrip they hold or handle, and to report the loss or destruction of\r\nsuch as may happen. A history of the loss is attached to the stub, and\r\nthe amount of the bill carried to the profit and loss account of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\"If the genuineness of any piece of scrip should be questioned, a\r\ncomparison with the stub should show the same date, number, amount and\r\nserrated edges, made by the peculiar pattern of the perforator belonging\r\nto that series. If so, the bill must be genuine. As time passes, we are\r\nmore than ever convinced of the wonderful advantage gained by the use of\r\nthis scrip. Our people find it much lighter and more desirable to carry\r\nand use, than the same amount of gold or silver coin; therefore they\r\nfrequently request to be allowed to exchange coin for scrip. In summing\r\nup my replies to your questions: it seems probable, from the constantly\r\nincreasing volume of business, that the company will soon be obliged to\r\ntake a charter that will authorize it to do a complete banking\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE INSURANCE OFFERED BY CO-OPERATIVE FARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I notice, Fillmore, that you mention the borrowing of ten thousand\r\ndollars from the insurance fund; the same being a part of the\r\naccumulated profits on the business of the store and restaurant. Tell\r\nme; how is it possible for so large a sum to be saved in such a short\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\n\"A complete answer to your question, will bring up the whole subject of\r\ninsurance; which presents some interesting problems. I will first try to\r\ngive you the basis for such an amount of savings. The net per-diem pay\r\nof $2.50 for each adult member of the company, will give an annual\r\nincome of a little more than $900. If we include an added pro rata for\r\nthe children, each one will spend annually at least $450 with the store\r\nfor goods; and $350 with the restaurant for food. Our statistics show\r\nmuch larger sums; but these will do for an estimate. Taking these\r\nfigures for a basis, we find that the annual sales made to our own\r\npeople by the store and restaurant combined, reach the startling sum of\r\n$400,000. A net profit of five per cent on this amount, gives $20,000\r\neach year to the insurance fund. At this rate, the profits for thirty\r\nmonths, reach the goodly sum of $50,000. To which we may add $2,500\r\nmore, as profits on sales to the amount of $50,000, made during that\r\nperiod by the store and restaurant, to people from surrounding\r\ncommunities. Altogether, we have a grand up-to-date total for the\r\ninsurance fund of $52,500. These profits will continue to increase with\r\nlarger sales to outside people; also with the increased wages or incomes\r\nof the co-operators, as the products and profits of the farm continue to\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\n\"Such favorable statistics are very encouraging. They demonstrate that\r\nonly a five per cent profit will be needed, to meet all future demands\r\nagainst the insurance fund, even when the colony has its maximum number\r\nof children and superannuated co-operators. The remaining profits, which\r\nin some departments of the store are large, may wisely be devoted to\r\neducational and missionary work.\r\n\r\n\"From another point of view, this eloquent array of figures, has an\r\nadditional value. They show conclusively, that the restaurant alone\r\nfurnishes a home market annually for $175,000 worth of farm produce:\r\nbeef, mutton, pork, lard, honey, syrup, milk, butter, cheese, eggs,\r\npoultry, vegetables, fruits and grains.\r\n\r\n\"If we consider the sales made by the store, we find after deducting the\r\ncost of raw material, that at least fifty per cent of the goods\r\npurchased by our people, are really the products of the skilled labor of\r\nthe farm: such as crockery, furniture, willow ware, picture frames,\r\nbrushes, clothing, underwear, bed furnishings, and goods from the\r\ntailoring, dress-making and millinery departments. From this showing it\r\nwill appear, that the store becomes a home market each year, for farm\r\nproducts to the amount of $112,500. To this, let us add the sums of\r\nsales through the restaurant, and those made through the markets of the\r\noutside world. Altogether, we have a grand total of $787,500 for the\r\nmarket value of farm products last year.\r\n\r\n\"Does this exhibit appeal to you as a reasonable basis for the\r\naccumulated savings named in your questions?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure the exhibit has astonished me greatly! Your figures and\r\nstatements are both fascinating and convincing. They are all, most\r\nexcellent arguments in favor of co-operative methods. I now perceive\r\nthat even on the basis of present conditions, a five per cent profit\r\nturned into the insurance fund, at the end of the first ten years, will\r\namount to the extraordinary sum of $200,000. With this magnificent fund,\r\nyou can afford to extend the scope of your original plan! How will you\r\ndispose of it? At what age do you propose to retire the active workers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, our original plans have been changed, and very much enlarged. The\r\ninsurance fund has grown so rapidly, that it was deemed wise to expend a\r\nportion of it, in building a hospital for the accommodation of our farm\r\npeople, and perhaps a few outside patients. Last year, a two-story and\r\nbasement brick building, was erected just in the heart of our finest\r\nshrubbery dotted lawn, some distance from the public square. It is large\r\nenough for about one hundred patients. Viewed from any point, it\r\npresents a charming appearance. It is conceded by all to be the\r\nhandsomest structure on the farm. Inside, with its polished floors,\r\nmagnificent windows, large rooms, high, beautifully frescoed walls and\r\nceilings, dainty couches, cozy chairs, and wide, breezy halls, with\r\npicture-laden walls; every condition is present to satisfy the highest\r\nideal of sick-room comfort. Brighter, sunnier, more health-inspiring\r\nrooms never soothed, charmed or healed a nerve shattered patient!\r\n\r\n\"Under the supervision of the sanitary committee, the hospital at\r\npresent, is in charge of a young surgeon employed by the company. His\r\nservices are utilized in teaching and preparing a class of trained\r\nnurses. He also teaches the members of the chemistry and physiology\r\nclubs, in their new study rooms at the hospital. At a later period this\r\nsurgeon will be superseded by two of our own people. A young woman and a\r\nyoung man, both with some previous knowledge of pharmacy, who have been\r\nin charge of the drug department at the store; have recently developed a\r\nstrong desire to take a thorough course of medicine and surgery at some\r\nleading school. Upon the recommendation of the general manager, approved\r\nby a unanimous vote of the co-operators, the expense of this schooling\r\nis to be taken from the insurance fund, with the understanding however,\r\nthat after graduating, they are to relieve the company of the expense of\r\na hired surgeon, by taking permanent charge of the hospital, or as our\r\npeople have christened it, the 'Temple of health.'\r\n\r\n\"Relative to the question of retiring members of the company; much\r\nthought and discussion on the part of our officers and co-operators, has\r\nbeen required, to properly and wisely fix the age at which such\r\nretirement shall take place.\r\n\r\n\"Many important questions have been considered. Our present colony, as\r\nyou know, is composed of young people, as a rule not yet thirty years of\r\nage. Individually they possess strong, disease-resisting, vital\r\norganizations, which have been reinforced by harmonious, mental and\r\nphysical development. This immunity from disease to such a large extent,\r\nhas been still further strengthened and fortified, by the beneficial\r\neffects of our organized sanitary, social and industrial methods. These\r\nmethods have lifted the weary burden of toil from our people, and\r\nsubstituted therefor, a light exhilarating labor, simply healthful\r\nexercise. Under such favorable conditions, our workers ought to reach\r\nthe age of fifty, with health and vigor still unimpaired. For the\r\nreasons named, very few of our co-operators, outside the ranks of the\r\nmother's club, are at present entitled on account of either illness or\r\naccident, to draw their wages from the insurance fund. Fortunately, so\r\nfar, not one has become permanently disabled! All things considered, it\r\nwas not unexpected, when a final vote on the question was taken, that a\r\nmajority was found to be in favor of fixing the age of retirement at\r\nfifty years.\r\n\r\n\"This decision will give the farm company, twenty years in which to\r\nprepare for the event. In the light of our past experience, no one\r\ndoubts our ability to accumulate an adequate fund, with which to meet\r\nthe additional drain upon it. This drain will prove a heavy one, as the\r\nretired pay of the co-operators, who have reached the age of fifty, has\r\nbeen fixed at two-thirds of their present pay, that is, fifty dollars\r\nper month or $600 per annum. Premising that the maximum number on the\r\nretired list at any one time will not exceed fifty; the total annual\r\nretired pay will then amount to $30,000.\r\n\r\n\"The following plan has been devised to meet this additional\r\nexpenditure. It has been demonstrated conclusively, that five years\r\nhence, the income of the farm, will warrant the increase of the wages of\r\neach member of the company, to $1,500 per year. At least $1,200 of this\r\namount, will be spent at the store or restaurant. We shall then have a\r\nnew basis for calculating the five per cent profit for the insurance\r\nfund; that is, $600,000 annually, which will give $30,000 each year for\r\nthe fund. Allowing that savings at the present rate, $20,000 per annum,\r\nfor seven and one-half years, aggregating $150,000; will prove ample for\r\nincidental needs, until the time for the retirement of the first\r\nco-operator! We calculate that fifteen years of savings on the new\r\nbasis, will give us twenty years hence, a fund of $450,000 to commence\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\"If practical experience should prove that larger savings are necessary;\r\nan additional two and one-half per cent profit, may be set aside for\r\nthis fund, without seriously curtailing the sums devoted to educational\r\nand missionary purposes. This will surely cover all possible\r\ncontingencies. More especially, as seven and one-half per cent of all\r\nretired pay, will come back to the fund as profits on purchases--active\r\nworkers having taken the place of the retired members. Considering the\r\ngenerous annuity provided by this insurance, together with the fact that\r\nthe wants of the pensioners will become fewer as age increases;\r\ndoubtless, at the end of each year, many of them will turn back into the\r\nfund, considerable sums of unused pay.\r\n\r\n\"As another important factor, connected with the question of this kind\r\nof insurance, it should be well understood, that after reaching the age\r\nof retirement, our members do not cease to be valuable productive\r\nworkers, either for the financial gain of the colony, or for the general\r\nwelfare of the movement, which the colony represents. On the contrary,\r\nin many cases, their services are liable to become more valuable than\r\never before. Between the ages of fifty and sixty, they remain subject\r\nto assignments to serve on committees, to act as traveling agents for\r\nthe company, to represent the company as lecturers and organizers, for\r\nthe spread of the movement; to act as aids to the teachers in the\r\nschools and the numerous clubs. They are also eligible to election as\r\ntown, county, state or United States officials. In committee work,\r\nconnected with the store and the various factories, their riper\r\njudgment, based on many years of experience, would prove especially\r\nvaluable: often by timely advice, they would be able to save for the\r\ncompany in one transaction, an amount in money more than equal to their\r\nentire wages for the year.\r\n\r\n\"In another way their services would prove equally advantageous. With\r\nsuch an increase of leisure, there would come to these retired\r\nco-operators, a desire, and the opportunity, to enter more actively into\r\nthe practical work of the scientific clubs. If inclined, they could take\r\nup all kinds of scientific research; making themselves especially useful\r\nin the practical, productive and profitable work of the educational,\r\nmicroscopical, chemical and photographic clubs. Those who had a talent\r\nfor invention, could then devote as much time, energy and thought to it,\r\nas they chose. To aid them, they would have the advantage of an acquired\r\nskill in the use of tools, and of all kinds of complicated machinery,\r\nwhich would be a part of the outfit belonging to the thoroughly equipped\r\nmachine shop at their disposal. In the laboratory, they could find the\r\nbooks, maps, and drawings, necessary to bring them up to date in any\r\nline of invention which they might choose to enter.\r\n\r\n\"Taking these important factors into consideration, we discover that\r\nour co-operative inventor, would be armed to conquer his subject by a\r\nmagnificent equipment, such as an ordinary inventor could not hope to\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n\"So ably reinforced by the advantages enumerated, our corps of\r\ninventors, of both sexes, would be inspired by a labor of love. Unbiased\r\nby any selfish motives, they would be working for the farm and for\r\nhumanity. With no cause to distrust their fellows, they could openly\r\ndiscuss their discoveries, without fear of having them stolen;\r\nconsequently, they could have the willing assistance of all the\r\ninventive minds in the colony, in developing and perfecting their\r\noriginal inventions. This would be an experience utterly unheard of, in\r\nthe annals of an industry based on the competitive system. It would be\r\nthe beginning of co-operative invention as an art. It would mark another\r\ngreat step in harmonious, practical and profitable co-operative\r\nthinking, that would lead to discoveries of vast importance to the\r\nworld; discoveries that could not be made in any other way. It is\r\ndifficult for even the most enthusiastic optimist to imagine, what a\r\nrevolution in the inventive world, will follow the introduction of such\r\nsuperior co-operative methods; or what wonders will be wrought by them,\r\nbefore the close of the first half of the twentieth century!\r\n\r\n\"Let us consider what they might do for our superannuated farmers.\r\nQuickened by such an added potency of perfect, co-operative, mental,\r\nconditions, our inventors would naturally aspire to still higher\r\nachievements. Each year they would be able to produce many valuable\r\ninventions, which could not be used by the farm, but which could be sold\r\nby the company after being patented, for good round sums in cash! In\r\nthis way it becomes evident, that our old members might prove the most\r\nprolific cash producers on the farm. It is even possible, and quite\r\nprobable, that the sale of one invention, might bring to the company, a\r\nsum of money, more than equal to the combined pensions of the retired\r\nco-operators for one year. From this particular source, would flow an\r\nadditional fund for educational work in pushing the movement before the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\"Viewed in this light, to be retired on two-thirds pay at the age of\r\nfifty, is simply a matter of justice! When justice is done, the mission\r\nof charity is finished!\r\n\r\n\"In considering the growing interest in the insurance question among\r\npeople of the outside world, we find great numbers of laboring people,\r\nand of small farmers everywhere, who are beginning to understand that it\r\nis a question of vital importance, an open gateway through which they\r\nmay gain access to the broad fields of abundance. Every day, both by\r\nobservation and experience, they are taught that without the aid of some\r\nspecial insurance, nine out of ten who start in business fail. Also,\r\nthat nine farmers out of ten, who start with a meagre capital, after\r\ntwenty years of constant toil, find themselves the slaves of some money\r\nlender who holds a mortgage on the farm. These mortgages are largely the\r\nresult of a hopeful struggle on the farmer's part, in a last vain effort\r\nto compete with the expensive methods of syndicate and bonanza farms.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder the average worker is anxious to discover some method of\r\ninsurance, that will safe-guard him against the disasters which have\r\noverwhelmed so many of his predecessors! No wonder these workers come to\r\nbelieve it possible, that out of a given number of say one thousand\r\nmen, who start in life without capital, except such as they possess in\r\nordinary health and strength; at least fifty per cent are liable to die\r\nin the poor-house, or in some way become helpless dependents on charity!\r\nAgainst such an alarming proposition, the average optimist or plutocrat,\r\ncries out, impossible! No, No! In this Republic, such things could never\r\nhappen! Besides, how preposterous! Don't you know, that the general\r\nprosperity of the country was never greater than now! Why the wealth of\r\nthe nation is growing at a marvelous rate! Never before, were fortunes\r\nmade so easily! The way is open for every industrious man; no matter how\r\npoor he may be at the start. If people come to want in the midst of such\r\ngolden opportunities, they have only themselves to blame.\r\n\r\n\"By way of an answer to these optimistic assertions, let us apply the\r\nfigures collected by Prof. A. G. Warner, published in his 'American\r\nCharities.' In this book he has tabulated the results of fifteen\r\ninvestigations, both in this country and abroad, into the actual causes\r\nof poverty. These investigations embrace over one hundred thousand\r\nindividual cases, found in the cities of Baltimore, New York, Boston,\r\nCincinnati, London, England, and seventy-six cities in Germany. In the\r\ncauses of poverty stated, eleven per cent are due to intemperance, ten\r\nand three-tenths per cent to other kinds of misconduct; while\r\nseventy-four and four-tenths per cent are due to misfortune, such as\r\npoorly-paid work, lack of work, sickness, etc. Here, we have actual\r\nproof that seventy-five thousand in the ranks of this vast army of\r\npoverty-stricken people, were reduced to such straits, by causes which\r\nthey could not control. How dreadful the significance of these terrible\r\nfigures! What a blot they become, on the fair page of progress achieved\r\nby the nineteenth century! What a warning to the people of the\r\ntwentieth! What an indictment against existing, social, and industrial\r\nconditions! What argument could be more convincing, or demand more\r\nimperatively, the immediate adoption of co-operative methods, which\r\noffer absolute insurance against the recurrence of such calamities?\r\n\r\n\"As relating to the insurance question, and by the way of a contrast\r\nbetween competitive and co-operative methods, let us consider the\r\nfollowing statement.\r\n\r\n\"We learn from statistics, that for the family of a skilled workman of\r\nthe better class--a family of five persons--the average annual cost of\r\nliving is $420. This includes food, shelter, raiment, fuel, laundry,\r\nlight, water, medical attendance, medicine, education and recreation.\r\n\r\n\"Under the competitive system, to earn this sum required, on the part of\r\nthe adults and such of the children as were able to work, the continuous\r\ntoil of three hundred days, twelve hours long--counting the possible\r\nworkers of the family as three, and the labor day as twelve hours\r\nlong--we have in the aggregate, say eleven thousand weary hours of this\r\nnerve depressing labor. A labor often performed in the midst of the most\r\nrepulsive and unsanitary conditions; to which the toilers were\r\nconstantly goaded by the cruel spur of necessity. This is a picture of\r\nthe living expenses and daily working life of a family of the superior\r\nclass, far above the average among the workers under the competitive\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\"To illustrate what the co-operative system can do, let us transfer the\r\naccount of this family, to a co-operative agricultural colony like this.\r\nOn the basis of three hundred days of labor annually, we should have\r\ndaily for the two adults--the children being in school--six hours of\r\nproductive labor and two hours of educative labor, an aggregate of four\r\nthousand, eight hundred hours, of work for the year. This work would be\r\nseparated by such generous periods of rest and recreation, and performed\r\namidst such pleasant surroundings, that the worker could truthfully\r\ncount them as so many hours spent in necessary healthful exercise.\r\n\r\n\"As a result of this labor, we could place the annual income of the\r\nfamily at $1,800. All available, for providing the very best of food,\r\nshelter, clothing, heat, light, laundry, hospital service, medical\r\nattendance, medicine, education and amusement. Also superior social\r\nsurroundings, with increased facilities for being well born; with\r\neducative advantages, embracing a higher order of intellectual\r\namusements, art-culture, musical training, and industrial skill.\r\n\r\n\"In addition, the family would enjoy a savings account of generous\r\nproportions, represented by the constantly increasing value of the farm,\r\nits stock, crops, buildings, store and goods, material, machinery,\r\nindustrial plants, orchards, vineyards and forests.\r\n\r\n\"Still better! They would have savings in the sinking fund, providing\r\nland, and homes for their children and grand-children in a long line of\r\nfuture generations.\r\n\r\n\"Best of all! This family would have savings in the insurance fund,\r\nproviding for an old age of ease and comfort, free from care, sweetened\r\nand brightened by leisure, travel and the refinements of study, art and\r\nmusic!\r\n\r\n\"In striking a balance between these two accounts, we discover a\r\ndifference in favor of the co-operative system, with its magical\r\ninsurance, which is wider, deeper and more startling than the difference\r\nbetween the illustrations of Dante's Inferno, and the descriptions of\r\nMilton's paradise!\r\n\r\n\"A careful study of this insurance question, has taught our people many\r\nvaluable lessons. They have learned to consider from a new standpoint,\r\nthe object and purpose of life, and the amount of work necessary to\r\nsupport that life.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned that poverty is a needless crime against progress,\r\nwhich can and must be abolished!\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that in these days of general prosperity, marked by\r\na wealth of labor-saving machinery, never before dreamed possible,\r\nco-operation has demonstrated, that an average of but six hours each\r\nday, devoted to farm work, will abundantly supply the means which will\r\nyield them, the highest advantages of birth, education, amusement, and\r\neverything necessary to a healthful enjoyment of life.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned that the true purpose of work, is not to make and\r\nhoard money; but to secure these advantages for themselves and their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned that money is not a necessity; that it is only the\r\nmeans to an end. They have learned that confidence in each other, among\r\nmembers of a co-operative colony, working unselfishly together, largely\r\ntakes the place of money.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned that practical education equips them with a\r\nknowledge, of how to deal justly with each other, in all the social\r\nrelations of life.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned that the pathway which leads to success, in winning\r\nthe largest measure of all these advantages, is reached by adopting\r\nunselfish methods, which will insure the welfare of all. They have\r\nlearned that this condition may be attained by building up co-operative\r\nsystems that furnish remunerative self employment, and at the same time\r\nenables them to enjoy free access to the natural sources of life.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned that this free access cannot be secured, without\r\nfirst obtaining permanent control of the necessary tracts of land, not\r\nless than ten acres per capita. They have learned that these tracts\r\nshould contain at least five thousand acres, in order to properly\r\nsupport an industrial co-operative colony of one thousand people.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned that the social, ethical and intellectual advantages\r\noffered to the individual, by this co-operative colony life, are even\r\ngreater than those relating to the question of finance.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that when selfish distrust of each other is once\r\nbanished from the minds of the workers by the force of repeated examples\r\nof co-operative success; then, it will be practical and easy to organize\r\nthe farms and farm laborers of this Republic, with its army of the poor\r\nand the unemployed of every class, into systems of co-operative farm\r\nvillages, or similar industrial associations.\r\n\r\n\"In this knowledge our people rejoice! They are filled with an unselfish\r\ndesire to spread the good news broadcast! Can you, my dear Fern! imagine\r\nfor them, a purpose in life more noble or more worthy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear Fillmore! I cannot! So eloquently have you stated the\r\ncase, that the outlook for the future is glorious! How graphically you\r\nhave pictured the growing importance of this question of insurance! I am\r\namazed, and more deeply interested than ever! I never before dreamed it\r\npossible, that the co-operative farm could offer so much defense against\r\nthe calamities of life, which grow out of the pinching pressure of\r\npoverty!\r\n\r\n\"The scheme for providing for the members of the Mother's Club, and for\r\nretiring co-operators at the age of fifty, meets my enthusiastic\r\napproval! I am sure it will commend itself to the workers and thinkers\r\nof the world! To me, it seems admirable, from every point of view!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE MOTHER'S CLUB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mark it well, Fillmore! I have now reached a very important question.\r\nWhat have you to tell me about stirpiculture, as a part of the\r\nco-operative farm movement?\"\r\n\r\n\"As a basis for the preliminary work, we have been following carefully,\r\nthe suggestions of your father, Fennimore Fenwick. You will remember, my\r\ndear Fern, that they were to the effect, that the children of the farm,\r\nshould be the crowning glory of all its products; that it should be the\r\nprovince of the corporation to provide for the children of the\r\nco-operators, every advantage of favorable pre-natal conditions, birth,\r\nunfoldment and education, that money could procure for the wealthy.\r\nTherefore, that ideal environments for mothers and motherhood, must be\r\ncreated and maintained.\r\n\r\n\"In order to carry out these epoch-making ideas, such of our matrons as\r\nare willing to assume the conditions, responsibilities, and cares of\r\nmotherhood, are relieved from all farm work, at any time they may chose.\r\nHowever, much of the work is so enjoyable, and affords so much pleasant\r\nexercise, that many of them become volunteers. Meanwhile, they are paid\r\nregular wages from our insurance fund. With this abundant leisure and\r\nfreedom from care, they are prepared to become zealous workers in the\r\nMother's Club.\r\n\r\n\"Our Mother's Club at Solaris, was organized by Gertrude Gerrish, as the\r\nfulfillment of a long cherished dream. She has reason to be proud of her\r\nwork! Like that other Gertrude, made so famous by Pestalozzi's charming\r\nstory, Gertrude Gerrish is a born teacher, an ideal mother, one of\r\nnature's noble women. Much of the success attained by the club, is due\r\nto her wonderful power as a leader. Her enthusiasm is infectious. It has\r\ncarried all obstacles before it. To this self appointed task, she has\r\ngiven her best energies, a rich harvest of ripe experience, with its\r\nfruitage of earnest thought, radiant and glowing with the genial\r\ninfluence of her sunny temperament, and withal, rendered more potent, by\r\nan overflowing love from the deep fountain of her great mother heart. Is\r\nit a matter of wonder, that she is such a general favorite with club\r\nmembers! Her word they accept as law. Her suggestions as commands.\r\n\r\n\"To Gertrude Gerrish, motherhood was a holy and sacred office, which\r\ndemanded from its devotees, a season of careful preparation, and a\r\nthorough knowledge of the physiological and psychological laws, which\r\ngovern that life-evolving function, that crowning glory of womanhood.\r\nShe seemed to be inspired with the idea, that progress has ordained,\r\nthat unwilling, ignorant and accidental mothers, must be replaced by\r\nthose who are predetermined, properly educated and fully prepared. These\r\nideas, she has endeavored to impress most forcibly, upon the minds of\r\nall club members. She has also taught them the importance of maintaining\r\njoyous, healthful, mental conditions; consequently, of carefully\r\navoiding all emotions of selfishness, cruelty, anger, envy, or\r\nmelancholy. In this connection, for the purpose of creating in the minds\r\nof our club mothers, as many good and pleasurable emotions as possible,\r\nand of repeating these anabolic emotions so often, that they may become\r\ndominant during the entire gestative period; Gertrude Gerrish has wisely\r\nplanned for them, a great deal of open air exercise, study and\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\"The study of botany, and botanizing parties, have become very popular.\r\nThese prospective mothers, have quickly learned how to amuse themselves,\r\nby combining study with pleasure. When organized into congenial outing\r\nparties, almost every fine day they may be found, seated in the\r\nluxuriously appointed motor carriages which belong to the club, ready\r\nfor a lively spin away to the woods. This gives them an opportunity to\r\nenjoy the pure air and bright sunshine, the wide, undulating landscape,\r\ntinted by the exquisite coloring of every flowering plant, shrub and\r\ntree. How delightful to them, is the restful green of dewy meadows; the\r\nsweet music of birds, the charming chatter and playful antics, of the\r\nswift-footed squirrels! How grateful, the leafy coolness and bracing\r\nozone of the forest; the dancing shadows of its deep glens, with their\r\ngarnered treasures of mosses and ferns! How inspiring, the merry tinkle\r\nof the clear streamlet, swiftly flowing over its rocky bed; or the\r\nlouder roar of the rushing waterfall, where drooping boughs glisten and\r\nsparkle with spray-laden foliage! All these, are nature's matchless\r\ncharms, which appeal to our young mothers in their best moments, their\r\nmost responsive moods; banishing all thoughts of evil, awakening in\r\ntheir hearts, new spiritual impulses, feelings of worshipful adoration;\r\nemotions of the highest and purest order. Than this, nothing could prove\r\nmore helpful in maintaining perfect conditions of mental and spiritual\r\nserenity.\r\n\r\n\"Inhaling the pure, invigorating air of the country, far from the dust\r\nand filth, the smoke and poisonous gases, the turmoil and strife, the\r\nceaseless din, the selfishness and sin of the great city, close to the\r\nfostering bosom of mother earth, under a broad dome of blue sky, bathed\r\nin floods of golden sunlight, exulting in the exuberance of perfect\r\nhealth, these grateful young mothers, realize how much they owe to the\r\nco-operative farm movement, for surrounding them with such ideal\r\nconditions of life.\r\n\r\n\"They realize, the great, good fortune of children, who are born and\r\nreared in the midst of such delightful environments. They perceive, with\r\na keen sense of sorrow, that children who are born and bred away from\r\nthese rural conditions, are robbed of more than one-half their natural\r\nrights. They realize, more than ever before, the filth, the misery, the\r\nsqualor, the fetid air, and the unsanitary conditions, of our great\r\ncities. They shudder, when they contemplate, the bitterness of the\r\nmisfortune, the cruelty of the deprivation, of the great mass of\r\nchildren, who must be born and bred in the midst of such depressing,\r\nunhealthy surroundings. They know intuitively, that only a puny, sickly,\r\nhalf-developed race of people, can come from such a sad birth. Under\r\nsuch circumstances, they do not wonder, that fully one-third of the\r\nhuman family, die in infancy.\r\n\r\n\"Indoors, the handsomely furnished, beautifully decorated club rooms,\r\nwhich are located in the kindergarten building, offer the maximum of\r\nelegance and comfort to club members. There, in harmonious groups, they\r\nmay engage in conversation, study, writing, musical exercises, and other\r\nvarieties of club work. The esthetic tastes of the members are\r\nquickened, and their pleasures much enhanced, by the fine display of oil\r\npaintings, water colors, pencil sketches, etchings, and photographs,\r\nwhich have been hung on the walls, by admiring friends from the art and\r\nphotography clubs. It has been the chosen work of the last named club,\r\nto supply the center tables in the reading rooms, with a series of large\r\nportfolios, containing a choice collection of finely finished,\r\nbeautifully mounted photographs. This collection is varied, unique and\r\nvaluable; and withal, exceedingly interesting. It embraces artistic\r\ncopies of the world's finest statuary, pictures of eminent men, noted,\r\nhistoric buildings, rare landscapes and most picturesque scenery. These,\r\nsupplemented by an abundant supply of choice books, furnish excellent\r\nconditions, and a most fascinating incentive, for a harmonious,\r\nsatisfying, self-culture, of the highest type. Under the able leadership\r\nof Gertrude Gerrish, the interest shown, the enthusiasm awakened, and\r\nthe progress achieved, is something remarkable.\r\n\r\n\"Thus prepared, the members find themselves on a higher mental and\r\nspiritual plane of existence, where they can appreciate the\r\npossibilities, of what may be accomplished by true motherhood, as a\r\nregenerator of society. They can understand the significance of the\r\ngreat lesson taught by history, which is, that all progress for the\r\nrace, depends upon the elevation, education and refinement, achieved by\r\nwoman. With quickened vision, they can perceive, that with the dawn of\r\nthe twentieth century, comes the beginning of a new cycle in the life of\r\nthe planet; the commencement of woman's golden era! In the higher light\r\nof such a vision, they become aware, that they must strive continually,\r\nfor more wisdom, that they may reach a higher consciousness of\r\nindividual responsibility, as keepers and guardians of the sacred temple\r\nof human life.\r\n\r\n\"In the preparatory work for a progressive parentage, club members are\r\ntaught, that prospective fathers and mothers, must become familiar with\r\nthe sciences, the industrial, and the higher arts, if they wish their\r\nchildren to inherit, whatever intellectual progress, they as parents,\r\nmay achieve. The new psychology, with a better knowledge of nature's\r\nevolutionary methods, declares, that these trained intellectual\r\nattributes, may be transmitted to offspring, if the parents are willing\r\nto prepare themselves, to respond to the demands of natural law.\r\n\r\n\"In the domain of more practical club work, the members are taught how\r\nto prepare the diet and clothing, which may be necessary for the proper\r\ncare of healthy nursing mothers and infants. They are also taught the\r\nhygiene and physiology of motherhood; in addition, as much as possible,\r\nabout the laws that govern the procreative body of woman, when it\r\nbecomes the temple of evolving life. In connection therewith, they are\r\ninstructed to observe closely, the initial and pre-natal conditions,\r\nwhich dominate this primal stage of embryo life.\r\n\r\n\"As a result of this comprehensive course of training, our young mothers\r\nsoon find themselves, inspired by a hypnotic wave of enthusiasm, which\r\nis sure to follow many days of pleasant association, discussion, and\r\nsystematic study. Stimulated by this enthusiasm, and aided by the\r\npotency of co-operative thinking, they endeavor to discover new avenues,\r\nthrough which they may reach and maintain, better physical, mental and\r\nspiritual conditions, which shall bring them into a more perfect\r\nharmony, with the laws of unfoldment which govern planetary evolution.\r\nThe success, which has rewarded their efforts in this direction, has far\r\nexceeded, even the ambitious hopes of Gertrude Gerrish.\r\n\r\n\"For the purpose of preserving a series of valuable records, for the\r\nbenefit of this and coming generations; club members are urged to put in\r\nwriting, such ideas as may come to them, as the result of individual\r\nthought, or from co-operative study, discussion and observation. These\r\npapers are carefully condensed, sifted, classified, and placed in proper\r\nrecord form, by the editing committee of the club. This committee, is\r\nalso instructed to prepare short extracts, essays and descriptive\r\narticles relating to club work, for publication in the mothers' column\r\nof the Solaris Sentinel.\r\n\r\n\"This outline sketch, my dear Fern, will give you some idea of the scope\r\nof the work, in which, I know you are greatly interested. In brief, it\r\nmeans a practical illustration, of the use of scientific methods, for\r\nimproving the race. The club hopes to give a satisfactory answer to the\r\ngreat question, of how to be well born. It will strive to convince the\r\nworld, that the time has arrived, in which the twentieth century demands\r\nthe immediate introduction of a scientific system, for the thorough\r\nbreeding of children as a fine art. The art of all arts! The highest of\r\nall possible achievements!\r\n\r\n\"Hitherto, the world's people, in trying to accumulate riches, or to\r\nescape the poorhouse, have had neither time nor inclination, to consider\r\nthis most important of all questions. As a matter of fact, greed for\r\ngold has become so dominant, human life, so cheap, and its progress\r\nthrough culture, held in such low estimation; that it is not unusual,\r\nnot even a matter of comment, to hear of a wealthy stockbreeder, who\r\nwillingly pays from ten to twenty thousand dollars a year to the trainer\r\nof his horses; while he grudgingly pays five hundred dollars a year to\r\nthe teacher of his children. This would indicate, that the demand for a\r\nchange is imperative. The great wave of evolutionary progress, is fast\r\nrising to a flood tide! The selfish, commercial spirit, born of the\r\ncompetitive system, must soon give way for something better! The advent\r\nof a system of unselfish, co-operative farming, which proposes to unite\r\na rational agriculture, with a scientific stirpiculture, offers\r\nopportunities for substantial progress, and a new hope for the coming\r\nrace.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is exceedingly interesting, Fillmore! What additional work, has\r\nGertrude Gerrish planned for the club members?\"\r\n\r\n\"A great deal more than I have time to enumerate, just now! However, by\r\nthe way of an illustration of her ingenious methods, and also, of the\r\ngreat variety of the topics introduced, all of which really belong to\r\nthe work, as an integral part of the movement. I may mention the latest\r\nscheme introduced by Gertrude Gerrish, which proposes to increase the\r\naverage length of human life, by giving to children as a birthright,\r\nwell developed vital, physical, and mental organizations. This, she\r\nclaims, is the only true ground work, for real progress in the right\r\ndirection. The scheme has proved a popular one. It has so aroused the\r\nzeal and enthusiasm of the club members, that they write, think and talk\r\non the subject, with an inspiration and eloquence quite surprising. As a\r\nresult of the remarkable interest awakened, they have diligently read\r\nbooks on evolution, physiology, psychology, vital statistics, physical\r\nculture, and a great number, on the general subject of health. In this\r\nrespect, the work of the club as a promoter of longevity, may well serve\r\nas an object lesson, for the hundred-year clubs, that have been\r\norganized during the past ten years, for the purpose of checking the\r\nalarming increase of suicide clubs.\r\n\r\n\"Touching the question of suicide, as an enemy to longevity: In\r\ndiscussing the subject, many members of the club maintain, that it is an\r\nimperative duty for them to give the world a new cure for suicide. They\r\nwould offer its would-be victims, such a tempting array of the meanings,\r\npurposes and opportunities, for gaining wisdom, which may crown every\r\nrightly conducted, harmoniously environed life; making it so busy, so\r\nabsorbing, and so happy; that there would be no room, for the morbid\r\nhallucination of a suicidal desire. This proposition is based on the\r\npresumption, that all suicides are possessed with an insanely erroneous\r\nidea, regarding the true object and purpose of human life. After the\r\npassing of a few generations, under the wide-spread reign of\r\nco-operative stirpiculture, with its hosts of mothers' clubs, suicide\r\nwill soon become an utter impossibility.\r\n\r\n\"In the ever broadening scope, of progressive kindergarten training, our\r\nyoung mothers have wrought their most important work. A work, which\r\nreflects on the club, a great deal of well-earned credit. As centers of\r\nthe first and second-year nursery groups, in their cargosita excursions\r\naround the great hall, for the purpose of sight, color and image\r\ntraining; the service rendered by these mothers, has proved invaluable.\r\nAs teachers, assistants, directors and leaders, in the third and\r\nfourth-year groups, while engaged in exercises and games, which have\r\nbeen devised and instituted, for the purpose of sense training, science\r\ntraining, and science recreation; in addition to the ordinary\r\nkindergarten course; their excellent work, has justly excited the pride\r\nof the colony.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, my dear Fern! I must tell you something about 'The club\r\nbabies,' as they are proudly designated by the members. They are very\r\nbright and beautiful! In fact, they seem born with a consciousness, that\r\nit is their peculiar privilege, to commence the study of life as a fine\r\nart, at its very threshold. They are the zealously guarded treasures of\r\nthe club, and the pride of the farm! They give a glorious promise, that\r\nthey will prove worthy leaders, of a coming host of dominant thinkers,\r\nwhich are to be given to the world, by the mothers' clubs of the next\r\nquarter of a century.\r\n\r\n\"As champions and exponents of the true object and purpose of human\r\nlife, these thinkers will be armed with a wonderful potency, with which\r\nto overcome and conquer, the selfish reign of the competitive system. A\r\ncruel system, which has proved the very incarnation, of 'Man's\r\ninhumanity to man,' causing countless millions to mourn! In this great\r\nwork, they will be inspired, by the high purpose of replacing its evil,\r\npoverty-breeding dominancy, by an unselfish, co-operative system, a\r\nunion of spiritualizing, educative, stirpiculture and agriculture, which\r\nshall insure a higher civilization, and the perpetual reign of peace and\r\nplenty for all mankind.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you have told to me so charmingly, Fillmore, is almost too good to\r\nbe true! How eloquently, and how interestingly, you have described, the\r\nscope and work of this wonderful club, with its gifted leader! I hail\r\nthe advent of this club, as one of the most important results, achieved\r\nby the Solaris Farm Company! I am delighted, with its thorough\r\norganization, broad plans, high aims, earnest work, and the remarkable\r\nenthusiasm, of its members! They represent a cause, which is dear to my\r\nheart!\r\n\r\n\"The question, of how to be well born, is to my mind, the foremost\r\nquestion of the day! A question, which demands universal consideration!\r\nThis twentieth century union, of agriculture and stirpiculture, this\r\nscientific, systematic, generation of the race as a fine art; which has\r\nbeen so well demonstrated, by the surprising work of these enthusiastic\r\nyoung mothers, is something to be proud of! The good, which must follow\r\nthe work of this club, cannot now be estimated. The one hope, for the\r\nregeneration and final salvation of society, is centered in the mothers\r\nof the Republic! Nothing, is so well calculated to impress the\r\nimportance of this grand truth, on the minds of the people, as the\r\npractical work of an ever increasing host of mothers' clubs.\r\n\r\n\"In their devotion to the Republic, these mothers are patriots of the\r\npurest type! They have arisen to such spiritual heights, that they may\r\nfearlessly proclaim the law of motherhood, for the sons and daughters of\r\nthe new Republic! They have demonstrated that this law declares, that a\r\nworthy mother of the new Republic, must be absolutely free! She must be\r\nfree, religiously, mentally, socially, physically, and financially! Thus\r\nunshackled, she may be properly prepared, to bear a race of children who\r\nare endowed by birth, with the incarnate spirit and genius of true\r\nliberty. Such liberty, as shall become the talisman and watchword, of\r\nthe model Republic of the twentieth century. A Republic of peers, of\r\nintellectual giants! The very flower of spiritual unfoldment! The\r\nhighest order of civilization! Under the starry flag of such a\r\ngovernment, neither slave, nor pauper, nor criminal, shall be found to\r\ncloud with shame, the fair escutcheon of true liberty!\r\n\r\n\"I shall endeavor, before leaving Solaris, to meet with the members, by\r\nattending some session of the club. I shall then take pleasure in\r\nrestating these ideas, as an expression of my appreciation of the great\r\nwork for humanity, which they have so successfully inaugurated.\r\n\r\n\"To Gertrude Gerrish, that noble woman, with such a magnificent talent,\r\nand so loyal a heart; who has won my deepest gratitude, my undying\r\nrespect; I must pay the tribute of my admiration, by taking her lovingly\r\nto my heart, as a sister woman, whose wonderful ability, as a thinker,\r\norganizer, and leader, has made me proud of my sex.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE CO-OPERATIVE FARM AS A FACTOR IN THE CAPITAL AND LABOR PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am curious to know, to what extent co-operative farming will effect\r\nthe capital and labor problem. What think you, Fillmore?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt the effect will be very marked. Many of the solutions arrived\r\nat in experimenting with the insurance question, will apply with equal\r\nforce towards a final solution of the capital and labor problem. The\r\ntoiler once having been taught the art of self-employment, that will\r\nfurnish him superior conditions for a perfected healthful enjoyment of\r\nlife, with all of the advantages for himself and his children that money\r\ncan buy for the wealthy; can never again become the working slave of\r\ncapital. He has learned, by a practical lesson, very similar to the\r\nfamous 'Gurnsey Market House' exploit, that labor unaided by capital,\r\ncan produce an abundance of things which go to make up the wealth of the\r\nnation, the community or the individual; while capital unaided by labor\r\ncan produce nothing.\r\n\r\n\"In searching for a remote cause for this ever growing warfare between\r\ncapital and labor, which has so long vexed our Republic; and which, even\r\nnow, threatens its final disintegration; we soon discover our arch\r\nenemy, the competitive system, as the party responsible for the\r\nmischief. This fact becomes more apparent, as we consider, that from the\r\nbeginning of the historical period, people in a fierce struggle for\r\nexistence, have been compelled by the competitive system, to wage a\r\nbrutal, relentless warfare with each other. Always the stronger,\r\nagainst the weaker. In this wicked war, millions of human lives have\r\nbeen sacrificed to the fiery moloch of selfish greed.\r\n\r\n\"The older the civilization the more fiercely has the war been waged;\r\nuntil to-day, thousands among the lower classes everywhere, dwarfed and\r\nembittered by a hopeless struggle to sustain life, in a ceaseless combat\r\nwith competing foes on every hand; spurred to a frenzy of fury, curse\r\nthe day which gave them birth. Why should they live only to suffer? With\r\nmoral natures starved and withered, they declare that all justice is a\r\nmockery, all honesty, a myth! They have lost faith in God, and\r\nconfidence in man! They care not for the needs of posterity, or for the\r\nnemesis of a future existence! In this desperate condition, they either\r\ncommit suicide, or become an easy prey to the temptation, to join the\r\noutlaws in taking the world by the throat. From such material is formed\r\nthe dregs of society, that lower social strata of living dynamite, that\r\nconstant menace, which threatens in the near future, to destroy all\r\ncivilization which rests upon it. This is a typical piece of the\r\nhandiwork of the competitive system, a system in which the roots of\r\nsociety to-day are grounded.\r\n\r\n\"Once seriously considered in this light, how can any sane person, who\r\nbelieves in an All-Wise Creator, in justice and mercy, in a common\r\nbrotherhood for humanity, ever again defend the wickedness, of a society\r\nbased on the selfish cruelty of such a system? What treatment may\r\nunorganized, unprotected labor, expect from this system?\r\n\r\n\"Hitherto, fortunately for the progress of the world, the laborers of\r\nthis Republic, have enjoyed more of the advantages of life, than those\r\nof any other country. With better wages and shorter hours for work, they\r\nhave been able to educate themselves and their children, to a degree\r\nthat would fit them to become good citizens of the Republic. A republic\r\nwhich for its continued existence, depends on the integrity, ability and\r\nintelligence of its working units. As such, our laborers have proved\r\nthemselves the best in the world. Now, alas! The whole industrial\r\nsituation is changed by the swift dominancy of the competitive system,\r\nwith its ever increasing brood of trusts, which have swallowed up all\r\nnatural opportunities, and monopolized all the leading business\r\nenterprises, of this hitherto progressive nation.\r\n\r\n\"The people of the Republic are divided into two classes; the employers,\r\nand the employed. The invention and introduction of new and expensive\r\nmachinery each year, augments the power of the trusts, to control the\r\nmarkets and the industrial situation. By the same means and at the same\r\ntime, they are fast reducing the number of employers, and increasing the\r\nnumber of those who must seek employment. Under such circumstances, each\r\nyear the fate of the worker in any class, either skilled or unskilled,\r\ngrows more desperate. He becomes more completely the slave of the trusts\r\nor capitalists who own the tools and who monopolize the industries. The\r\nlarger the dependent family of the worker, the more abject the slavery,\r\nand the less his power to resist a constant reduction of wages.\r\n\r\n\"In the efforts made by organized labor unions, to resist this tendency\r\nto reduce wages, we have both the cause and the beginning of the war\r\nbetween capital and labor. With a courage and patriotism worthy of the\r\ndays of 'Seventy-Six,' this war has been waged by the toilers, with a\r\ndetermination to maintain rights guaranteed to them by the constitution\r\nof the Republic. A right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\r\nA right to labor and to enjoy the fruits of their labor, by having free\r\naccess to a reasonable share of the natural advantages belonging to the\r\npublic domain.\r\n\r\n\"In this heroic struggle, so sturdily maintained during the past\r\ntwenty-five years against the competitive system and its well trained\r\nhosts; the campaign, which has been marked by many mistakes, followed by\r\nfrequent defeat and disastrous failure, has always proved successful as\r\nan educator, both for the toilers and the great middle classes, who\r\nsympathized with them. On the other hand, alarmed by sudden success,\r\nachieved by the disruption of long-lived business methods, and the loss\r\nof confidence in exchange values, on the part of the public in\r\nconsequence of this disruption; the generals of the competitive system,\r\naided with but few exceptions, by the press, university and pulpit, have\r\nshrewdly endeavored to evade responsibility, for the disastrous panics\r\nwhich have followed such revolutionary methods. These panics have left\r\nthe country disturbed and embarrassed, by armies of unemployed men.\r\n\r\n\"In the same line of tactics, these competitive leaders, have endeavored\r\nto confuse the question, and to mystify the people, by raising the cry\r\nof over-production! The inexorable law of supply and demand! The\r\nimpossibility of our manufacturers longer competing in the markets of\r\nthe world, against the cheap products of the pauper labor of Europe,\r\nwhile they are obliged by the unions, to pay such exorbitant wages here.\r\nThis cry has grown more insistent, with each succeeding year.\r\nNevertheless, the fact still remains, that but for the continuous\r\nopposition of the united labor organizations, long before this time, the\r\nwages paid in Europe, would govern the price of labor in this Republic.\r\nWhat then would have happened to our workers, the basic units of our\r\ngovernment? Fortunately, the campaign of education still continues! The\r\npeople at large are just beginning to wake up to the importance of the\r\nlabor question! They have studied it carefully and earnestly. They have\r\nlearned that in productive labor, muscular effort is a mental\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that the products of the skillfully educated,\r\nintelligent, refined, moral, self-respecting worker of this Republic,\r\ncan successfully, compete with the inferior products, of a less\r\nintelligent or pauperized labor of any country, in any of the markets of\r\nthe world. No matter how high the wages of the former, or how low the\r\nwages of the latter may be.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that the demand, in any market for a superior\r\narticle, will always drive out the inferior.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that the question of the unemployed, is a question\r\nof the utmost importance, which demands the immediate attention of all\r\npatriots. They have learned, that the unemployed we shall have with us\r\nin ever increasing numbers, so long as the competitive system shall\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that not one from the ranks of the unemployed, can\r\nagain become a worker, without paying a handsome bonus for the\r\nprivilege, by allowing some one to pocket the lion's share of the\r\nprofits he may be able to earn.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that when society encourages conditions, which\r\ncause the laborer to look upon any calamity as a blessing in disguise,\r\nbecause it offers work for the unemployed; that society, must be\r\nreorganized.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that whenever an industrial system produces\r\nconditions, which make the laborer see only disaster for his individual\r\ninterests, in every labor-saving invention which may be introduced; such\r\na system, must be superseded by a better one.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that the competitive system, by the very nature and\r\nterms of its organization, obliges its followers to be selfish, cruel,\r\nheartless, unmanly and unpatriotic. They have learned, that its reign\r\nhas become so dominant, that it justifies a recent writer of most\r\nexcellent wit, who declares that 'Man by birth, education and training,\r\nhas become so essentially selfish, that no preaching has any effect upon\r\nhim, if it does not advise him to lay up treasures for himself\r\nsomewhere.'\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that the dangers which most seriously threaten the\r\nperpetuity of our Republic, do not come from the clamor of dissatisfied\r\nlaborers, who are wrongfully accused of law-breaking; but, that these\r\ndangers do come, from the lawlessness of capital, and the anarchy of\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned that so far as the interests of the working units of\r\nthe Republic are concerned, or care for its continued existence as a\r\nrepresentative government; the press, the university, and the pulpit,\r\nhave all been syndicated and censored by the competitive system to such\r\nan extent, that they can no longer be trusted to furnish teachers,\r\nleaders, and guides.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that the only safe course is, for the people to\r\ndepend upon themselves, to develop and establish a new social and\r\nindustrial order, from which shall spring a class of incorruptible\r\nleaders and statesmen, whose pure, unselfish motives, dominant, evenly\r\ndeveloped minds, and superior ability, shall mark them as fitting rulers\r\nfor a more perfect Republic. Such a Republic as shall meet the demands\r\nof a twentieth century progress.\r\n\r\n\"They have learned, that the remedy indicated is a change to an\r\nindustrial system, that will secure to the laborer an equitable share of\r\nthe benefits, which follow the introduction of labor-saving machinery.\r\nUnder such conditions, the laborer himself, having more leisure and\r\nunexpended vitality, will be stimulated to increase his available\r\nresources by cultivating his brain capacity for invention, thereby\r\nlargely increasing his power to produce.\r\n\r\n\"After many years, the rank and file of the workers in the labor unions,\r\nhave learned, that self-employment is the key to the situation. Although\r\nlate, they have learned, that if all the money wasted in unsuccessful\r\nstrikes, had been invested in the purchase of choice locations,\r\nundeveloped mines and mineral lands, and in the erection of\r\nmanufacturing plants, the labor question would now be a thing of the\r\npast. They would be masters of the situation, to whom the capitalists\r\nwould be glad to offer such a liberal system of profit-sharing, as would\r\npractically make the workmen self-employed, by reason of a part\r\nownership in the enterprise they labored to exploit.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, and most important of all; they have learned that all\r\nmanufacturing industries, naturally grow out of agriculture. That the\r\nsuccess of one, is the measure, for the success of the other. That they\r\nmust co-operate to such an extent, that a constant, healthy growth of\r\nboth, may be maintained.\r\n\r\n\"They have become convinced of the imperative necessity for this\r\nequable, co-operative, progress, by a careful study of the threatening\r\nconditions which obtain, in countries where agriculture has declined;\r\nand where manufacturing industries have become abnormally predominant.\r\nIn such countries, the food supply at once becomes a question of daily,\r\nnay of hourly importance. It must be imported from distant lands,\r\nsubject to the tax of insurance, import and export duties, freight\r\ncharges, and commissions. Under such adverse conditions, available\r\nsupplies for but a few days only, stand between the toiler and gaunt\r\nhunger. Any catastrophe which may happen to already congested lines of\r\ntransportation, will precipitate a famine. Then prices would go up with\r\na bound. The constant menace of such a possibility, always serves to\r\nkeep food-prices above the natural level of a fair profit. On the other\r\nhand, in countries where progress in agriculture and manufacture goes\r\nhand in hand; a constantly increasing home market for manufactured\r\nproducts is steadily maintained. A most important consideration! At the\r\nsame time, the industrial centers have the advantage of the immediate\r\nvicinity of abundant food supplies, which are not subject to the\r\nvicissitudes of traffic or transportation, or to the tax of much\r\nhandling.\r\n\r\n\"In considering these things, the minds of a great majority of the\r\nlaboring people, have been prepared to accept the conclusion, that the\r\ngreat question of the hour is, how to open the way for every worthy\r\nworker to become his own employer. The co-operative farm opens the way.\r\nTherefore, it is to these self-educated toilers in the ranks of the\r\nlabor organizations, that the manifest advantages of co-operative\r\nfarming will appeal most successfully. If properly approached, a\r\nmajority of them would be, not only willing but anxious for an\r\nopportunity to give this new system of co-operative agriculture a\r\nthorough trial.\r\n\r\n\"Having once become practically interested, these people would soon\r\nlearn to consider the object and purpose of life from a new standpoint.\r\nFrom this new concept of the meaning and necessities of life, they would\r\nperceive that it did not require the hoarding of much wealth, in order\r\nto satisfy them. The insurance system in providing for the wants of old\r\nage, would forever banish the haunting specter of a pauper's death in\r\nthe poor-house. They would then realize that money, was not so precious\r\nas a human life! They would clearly understand that money was an\r\nabsolute necessity, only to those under the competitive system who had\r\nlost confidence in each other, and faith in the fact of a common\r\nbrotherhood for humanity!\r\n\r\n\"They would soon respond to happier surroundings, in every way so\r\nconducive to a natural, soul growth, and to the harmonious unfoldment of\r\nthe individual from within. In this unfoldment, a new meaning for\r\nimmortality would come to them. Spiritual law would become operative. It\r\nwould teach them that, as immortal beings, as cosmic units of the larger\r\ncosmos--The Great Over Soul--they could not become totally depraved,\r\neven under pressure of evil conditions of the most degrading character;\r\nno matter how much their spiritual natures had been stained or starved.\r\n\r\n\"With this new standard as a guide, there would come an inspiration to\r\nstrive for the attainment of a higher, purer, better life. A life more\r\nin harmony with the design of an All-Wise Creator! Angry, antagonistic\r\nfeelings, against hitherto competitors, would disappear. The world would\r\nwear a smile instead of a frown! Brotherly love between man and man,\r\nwould become the rule in place of the exception! Gold would lose its\r\ncharm! Avarice would pass away! Selfish instincts, born of bitter years\r\nunder a cruel system would soon follow! Long dormant, spiritual natures\r\nwould be awakened! A new spiritual growth would take place! A vastly\r\nwider, mental, and spiritual horizon, would be added to the wisdom of\r\nthe individual! In the light of this wisdom would come the discovery,\r\nthat the virtue of right living, bears the seeds of a perpetuity, which\r\nbegets true and lasting happiness! An overwhelming answer in the\r\naffirmative, from every point of view, to the question, does it pay to\r\nbe unselfish?\r\n\r\n\"With higher ideals of life and its duties, these physically, mentally,\r\nand spiritually emancipated toilers, would find themselves prepared to\r\nco-operate most effectually, in establishing and maintaining any social\r\nand industrial evolution, which the best interests of the people and the\r\nRepublic might demand.\r\n\r\n\"From this presentation, my dear Fern! you may imagine how important and\r\ndesirable it is, that these two powerful industrial forces should become\r\nharmoniously united in working for the interests of a natural\r\nprogressive evolution. Against such an invincible combination, the hosts\r\nof the competitive system might not hope to prevail! Once thus united,\r\neach co-operative farm would then become the nucleus of a new industrial\r\norganization, capable of such unlimited expansion and perfection as the\r\nneeds of surrounding communities might be able to sustain.\r\n\r\n\"As this twin series of giant industries continued to grow and expand,\r\nthe ways by which they might co-operate with mutual benefit, would\r\ncontinue to multiply. In political matters such a combination would\r\nprove remarkably strong; first in the township and county; later, in\r\nstate and national legislatures, where it would soon be able to demand\r\nand push forward favorable legislation, and also to strangle much that\r\nmight threaten to prove adverse. In such efforts, would come\r\nopportunities for introducing to the arena of public life, an abler,\r\nnobler, purer class of young men; who, born of a better social,\r\nindustrial system, by reason of superior conditions for birth and\r\ntraining, would be properly endowed with that inspiring patriotism,\r\nsterling integrity, and commanding ability, so necessary to maintain the\r\ndominancy and perpetuity of the Republic, as a government of the people,\r\nfor the people and by the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo! Well done Fillmore! Your statement of the subject is grand,\r\nindeed! The eloquent summing up, forms a fitting climax in answer to my\r\nlast question, the closing one of the series. But, as much as I admire\r\nand appreciate its general excellence, you must allow me to suggest one\r\ncriticism. Do you not think Fillmore, that you put the case rather too\r\nstrongly, when you place the press, the university and the pulpit, so\r\ncompletely under the control of trusts, or the leaders of the\r\ncompetitive system? Would they dare to do such a thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless you my dear girl! They are capable of doing anything! So far as\r\nthe trusts and the competitive system are concerned, I have stated the\r\ncase very mildly. Not one-half of the story has been told. Let us probe\r\nthis question a little deeper.\r\n\r\n\"What is a trust? It is the highest form of monopoly. It is a nest of\r\ncorporations, laid and hatched by the competitive system! It has neither\r\nconscience to hold it in check, nor soul to be damned! It dares to do\r\nanything! Indeed! It is formed for the sole purpose of making money.\r\nNothing is allowed to stand in the way. Born of the consolidating\r\npressure, which marks the competitive system, it seeks to monopolize all\r\nof the advantages of that cruel system, without incurring its penalties.\r\nOnce thoroughly organized, and armed with the almost unlimited power of\r\nits enormous capital; the trust immediately commences the wholesale\r\ndestruction of all opposing industries or interests. In pushing this\r\nwork, it regards neither the equities of commercial law, nor the vested\r\nrights of others. Securely protected by its monopoly, this modern\r\njuggernaut in the commercial world, rolls remorselessly onward toward\r\nits goal of wealth. It cares not for the safety of worshippers, friends\r\nor foes. If by chance they represent competing interests, they must\r\neither leave the field or be crushed. There is no alternative! There is\r\nno escape!\r\n\r\n\"A few of the leading trusts, those most completely representing the\r\ncompetitive system, have recently become so defiant, so audaciously\r\nbold, that they are prepared to undertake, to consolidate the business\r\nof the whole earth. They will stick at nothing! They have the gorge to\r\nswallow one government or ten! It matters little to them! Like the ring\r\nof conspirators, in Donnelley's 'Ceaser's Column,' a few of the leading\r\nspirits, of these daring trusts, are secretly plotting in Gotham! Just\r\nat present, they have their eyes fixed on the all-powerful money\r\nquestion. The vision seems a pleasing one!\r\n\r\n\"What is that question, which so completely absorbs the attention of\r\nthese people? Can it be possible, that the mills of the competitive\r\nsystem will grind up rich bankers, as unconcernedly as they do the\r\nhelpless poor! They surely will! The plot grows and thickens! Let us\r\ngive it close attention. Let us watch these people. Keeping in mind\r\nmeanwhile, that hitherto, the bankers of the country, have complacently\r\nconsidered themselves masters and kings of the financial situation,\r\nwhose thrones were secure for all time. Strongly intrenched behind\r\nwell-filled money bags, they have felt themselves safe in helping the\r\ntrusts to fleece the public. Now they are becoming alarmed. They are\r\nshaking in their fifteen-dollar boots! They behold that dreadful\r\nhandwriting on the wall! In giant letters, seemingly towering forty feet\r\ntall, these bankers read the doom, which the trust conspirators are now\r\npreparing for them. They catch the frightful significance of the\r\nquestion, which the trust leaders are discussing. It is this. Why should\r\nthe business of the United States, support such an army of banks? More\r\nthan ten thousand. We know very well, that the entire money transactions\r\nof this country, could be handled more safely, more swiftly, and more\r\ncheaply, by one grand central institution. With one voice the\r\nconspirators exclaim! Let us form a pool! Let us consolidate the whole\r\nbusiness, into one magnificent money trust! Let us select, say\r\ntwenty-five, of the brainiest bankers in the business! Let us give them\r\nfat salaries, and make them superintendents of the financial agencies,\r\nnow called banks. Counting the whole number of banks, both public and\r\nprivate, as ten thousand, with three professional bankers to each one,\r\nthe result would be a total of thirty thousand bankers. Of this number,\r\nwe could reduce twenty-nine thousand, nine hundred and seventy-five, to\r\nthe station of bank clerks. Let us pause for a moment to contemplate the\r\nresult! What enormous savings would accrue, by the introduction of such\r\na wholesale scheme of consolidation! These savings would be ours!\r\nIntoxicated with the brilliancy and the hugeness of the idea; the\r\nconspirators with one impulse, spring to their feet, with outstretched\r\nhands they form a ring, they execute a round dance extraordinary. While\r\nthus engaged, they gaily shout, 'There is millions in it for us!'\r\n\r\n\"No wonder the bankers are alarmed! With the exercise of one-half of\r\ntheir usual cunning and foresight, they should have scented the danger\r\nsooner. No doubt, they were so engrossed by the fascinating game of\r\nmoney grabbing, that they were wholly blind to danger, as the result of\r\nthe combined audacity and perfidy of their former partners. They have\r\nevidently failed to learn one plain lesson, which is taught by the logic\r\nof events. It is this. When once fairly started, the process of the\r\nlarger corporation, swallowing the lesser, goes forward with such an\r\never-increasing rate of speed, that it soon overtakes and gobbles up\r\nbanks and bankers.\r\n\r\n\"At this point, it is pertinent to propound the following questions: If\r\nthis is a Republic? If the people are the government, and the government\r\nis the people? And if the consolidating business, is so good and so\r\nprofitable for the trusts? Why, should not the government, own and run\r\nthis giant central bank? Why, should it not own and operate the\r\nrailroads, the canals, the shipping, the mines, the forests, and all\r\nother industries? This would give the people a chance to share equally,\r\nin the enjoyment of these enormous profits. Why not?\r\n\r\n\"What say you my dear Fern! Would it not be infinitely better, than to\r\nallow the government to be swallowed by one monster trust?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better Fillmore! Far better! I am convinced! I withdraw my criticism.\r\nYou have maintained your point so vigorously, that I have not the\r\ncourage, to offer one single word in reply. I am ready and willing, to\r\nconsider the discussion as finally closed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE CO-OPERATIVE FARM TRIUMPHANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the second decade of the twentieth century, saw the\r\nfinal triumph of the co-operative farm at Solaris. The five years of\r\ntrial and probation, have swiftly passed into history. The labors of the\r\ncolony, have been crowned with a rich harvest of success. A great work\r\nfor humanity, has been accomplished. A grand lesson in the economics of\r\nunselfish co-operation, has been demonstrated. A kaleidoscope of new\r\ncharms, of fresh beauty, of an infinite variety of change, of unexpected\r\nopportunities, of a host of new expressions, in the possibilities of\r\nsocial and industrial life; the culmination of untried methods, new\r\nhopes and new aspirations; have marked this victorious climax. All have\r\ncontributed, to the happiness of the contented villagers at Solaris;\r\nfilling their hearts with brighter hopes for the future.\r\n\r\nA new era in agriculture has dawned. With it has come, a new order of\r\nlife for farm people. The links of social life, have become more firmly\r\nknit. New chains of enthusiastic interest, in the humanitarian work\r\nrepresented by the farm, have been forged by the binding associations of\r\npassing years. Ethical, industrial and spiritual life, has been\r\nunfolded, in harmony with the law of progressive planetary evolution.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the perfected possibilities of rural life, this\r\nsuggestive and pleasing picture is well nigh complete. Verily! Virtue\r\nhas been richly rewarded, by the pure pleasure of right living! To the\r\ntruths of these things, the lives of the unselfish co-operators at\r\nSolaris, bear most abundant and convincing testimony. Happiness and\r\ncontentment, reign supreme! Social solutions, offer new fields of\r\npleasure to a generous, progressive people, who are daily becoming\r\nbetter educated, more dominant as thinkers, more unselfish in all\r\nthings, therefore, more virtuous.\r\n\r\nIn passing from the experimental, to a more perfect stage of\r\nco-operative life, a marvelous change for the better is noted. New\r\nfactories have been built, new industries instituted, and organized. The\r\nbusy hum of industrial prosperity, everywhere claims attention.\r\nMeanwhile, the demands for a better esthetic culture, have not been\r\nneglected. The interiors of both factory and workshop, have been made\r\nadditionally attractive, by a more artistic, educative class of\r\ndecorations. All industrial buildings, are surrounded by well-kept\r\nlawns.\r\n\r\nMany handsome cottages, showing a great variety of beautiful designs,\r\ncosey, vine-clad and picturesque, environed by gardens and lawns, have\r\nbeen added to the architectural display of the village. Order, symmetry\r\nand cleanliness, have become the established law of the farm.\r\n\r\nBarns, stables, stock yards, pig pens and poultry yards, have been\r\nplaced at a safe distance from the village. In the erection of these\r\nnecessary buildings, care has been taken, to provide for the removal and\r\nsanitary dry storage, of the daily accumulation of valuable manures.\r\nEspecially designed machinery, accomplishes this otherwise unpleasant\r\ntask, quickly and easily. By this convenient arrangement, with a very\r\nlittle labor, these buildings, and the stock housed in them, can at all\r\ntimes, be kept healthy and clean. A most important consideration!\r\n\r\nEverywhere, appear evidences, of the farms increasing wealth in live\r\nstock. Great herds of fine cattle, are fattening in the fields, pastures\r\nand barns. Prize collections of choice sheep, are roaming over grassy\r\nslopes. Fine droves of well grown, healthy swine, in assorted lots, are\r\ncontentedly feeding in small fields of fresh clover. The large drove of\r\nbeautiful, highly bred horses, is a very valuable one. The poultry\r\nyards, are filled with many varieties of fine fowls. All show the\r\neffects of careful attention, from the hands of care takers, who are\r\nboth kind and skillful.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the village, near the nursery, the numerous fish\r\nponds are located. Flower bordered, island studded, and tree margined,\r\nwith surfaces dotted here and there, by tiny fleets of graceful,\r\nshell-like pleasure boats. They add much to the rare beauty of this\r\npastoral picture. Beneath the rippling surface of the clear water, in\r\nthese miniature lakes, flash the shining scales of a swarming host, of\r\nthe most delicious of food fishes.\r\n\r\nFragrant, purple and gold, the heavily laden vineyards, are growing and\r\nglowing in the bright sunlight. They give promise of an early generous\r\nfruitage. Thrifty orchards of healthy well-grown fruit trees, including\r\nmany varieties, are fast coming to maturity. Waving fields of golden\r\ngrain, ripple in the simmering heat of a noon-day sun, or rustle and\r\nbillow with each passing breeze, under the pale light of a harvest moon.\r\nBeautiful fields of cotton and corn, are an inspiration to behold. Fine\r\nfields of vegetables, nurseries, gardens and shrubberies, with a wealth\r\nof lovely flower plots, all add to the charm of the general effect.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the co-operative system, to embrace the second farm,\r\nhas been well started. Fenwick Farm, is the name chosen for this farm\r\nnumber two, of the series. Two years of intelligent, well-directed work,\r\nby its wide awake, industrious people, have shown surprising results!\r\nThey are constantly inspired to do better work by the hope of being able\r\nto reach a degree of success, equal to that achieved by Solaris. In this\r\nrespect, the spirit of healthy rivalry, which has arisen, gives them an\r\nadvantage, which the parent colony did not have. The success already\r\nattained by Fenwick Farm, has attracted widespread attention, in the\r\nsurrounding communities. The effect for the good of the county, and of\r\nits people, socially, politically and financially, has been quite\r\nremarkable. The tax payers of the county, are delighted! They have been\r\ncompletely won over, to the side of co-operative farming, by the force\r\nof this second example.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest gains, which has arisen from co-operative effort\r\nfor mutual benefit, between the two colonies, has been practically\r\nillustrated, in the great work of road building. These two co-operative\r\nfarm villages, are now connected by a broad, smooth, well graded road.\r\nThis road, ten miles in length, is margined by a wide strip of\r\nbeautifully kept parking. Five miles of this parking, on either side of\r\nthis magnificent boulevard, become the especial care, of each village.\r\nNo city in the union, could display better taste, or greater pride, in\r\nkeeping these beautiful parks, in the most perfect condition.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the park lawns, foliage and flowers, always looking\r\nclean and bright, it becomes necessary to keep this road free from dust.\r\nFor this purpose, the entire road surface, is given a frequent\r\nsprinkling with petroleum. After each sprinkling, the enormous pressure\r\nof an hundred-ton roller, soon converts the layer of moistened dust,\r\ninto a hard, smooth mass of oily rock. This process is repeated until a\r\nthick, heavy, durable surface of water-proof rock, is secured. This\r\nmakes an ideal road! The hard, well pounded, gravelly soil, below, gives\r\na permanent foundation, because it is so well protected against\r\nmoisture, by this broad, indestructible roof of oily rock. The wide,\r\nslightly rounded surface of the road, sheds water like a duck's back.\r\nConsequently, it is always free from mud and dust. The broad rubber\r\ntires of a great variety of freight motors, pleasure mobiles and motor\r\ncycles, do not wear its perfect surface. The very acme of pleasure is\r\nreached, in riding over such a delightful road!\r\n\r\nAfter work hours have passed, the pleasure seekers from both villages,\r\nin merry congenial parties are awheel, enjoying to the utmost, the\r\npure, sweet, flower-perfumed air, together with the soothing, restful\r\nbeauty of a park lined drive, of such extent and variety, as a\r\nmulti-millionaire, might not be able to command. Could anything more\r\ndelightful be imagined! Is it any wonder, that people from adjoining\r\ncounties, thirty miles away, come in droves, to enjoy a ride over this\r\nnow famous road! In the hearts of all comers, is stirred the imitative\r\nspirit of rivalry. They return to their homes, determined to co-operate\r\nwith their neighbors, at least to an extent that will enable them to\r\nbuild such roads for themselves. They are convinced, that the excellence\r\nof its roads, in any community, is the only sure test, which will\r\nindicate the exact degree of civilization, attained by its people.\r\n\r\nAt the village of Solaris, the universal use of Solaris brick, of the\r\nvarious patterns and sizes, has proved an important factor in the\r\nconstruction of sidewalks, store houses, industrial buildings, cottages,\r\nthe hotel, the schools and the theatre. The visitor is at once impressed\r\nby the wholesome, attractive, substantial appearance, given to the town\r\nby the use of this excellent and durable brick. In this respect, the\r\nsquare mosaic bricks, of unique design, used in laying the broad\r\nsidewalks, twenty feet in width, which border Railroad Avenue, the\r\nstreet leading straight from the public square, to the railroad station,\r\ncreate an effect so marked that it never fails to attract attention and\r\nadmiration. The symmetrical trees and well-kept parking which line this\r\navenue, serve to enhance the pleasing effect.\r\n\r\nThe artistic skill acquired by the people of Solaris, in the making and\r\nlaying of this new style of brick, adds another important advantage, to\r\nthe long list offered by co-operative methods. In color, thickness,\r\nsanitary shapes, variety of designs, fire-proof qualities, polished\r\nsmoothness and durability, these bricks recommend themselves to the\r\nfavor of the general public, wherever they go. Without any effort in the\r\nline of advertising, the general demand for them has continued to\r\nincrease, until brick-making has become the leading lucrative industry\r\non the farm.\r\n\r\nAmong the new buildings at Solaris, most worthy of mention, are the\r\ntheatre, and the two large school buildings, on either side of it. These\r\nstructures, are by far the finest ones in the village. The affectionate\r\npride they excite in the hearts of the villagers, is well deserved.\r\nCentrally located, on the east side of the public square, this\r\ntriumvirate of noble buildings, claims the admiration of the beholder,\r\nfrom any point of view on the open square. The front walls are\r\nbeautifully ornamented, in harmony with an architectural design, which\r\nis considered by critics, as exceedingly artistic. Inside, they have\r\nbeen constructed, finished, fitted and furnished, in accordance with a\r\ndesign, that will afford to the villagers, the highest order of\r\neducation and amusement.\r\n\r\nThe theatre is two hundred feet long, and seventy-five feet wide. The\r\nschools, are each one hundred and seventy-five feet in length, by forty\r\nfeet in width. They are separated from the theatre, by twenty feet of\r\nspace. A roomy covered way from the rear, connects them with that\r\nbuilding. In construction, care has been taken, to secure perfect light\r\nand ventilation.\r\n\r\nThe school on the left, is for pupils who enter the primary, and the\r\nfirst, second and third, intermediate classes. The one on the right, is\r\nfor students, who may be promoted to the first, second and third, high\r\nschools. The seating capacity of each one, is ample for three hundred\r\nchildren. The decorations of the walls and ceilings are, to a remarkable\r\ndegree, both educative and ornamental. The equipment of school\r\nfurniture, such as seats, desks, dictionaries, text books, globes and\r\noutline maps; drawing-boards, blackboards and laboratory outfit; glass\r\ncases, for collections of geological specimens and minerals; life size,\r\nphysiology models and charts; together, with a complete series of charts\r\nfor the other sciences; is the best that could be designed or procured.\r\n\r\nThe theatre, is a very important part of the educative system.\r\nFortunately, the acoustic properties, are remarkably fine! The entire\r\ninterior, including the high ceiling, is decorated with such boldly\r\nbeautiful designs, that they never fail to gratify the artistic sense of\r\nthe beholder. At night, the charming effect of these embellishments, is\r\nintensified, by the use of a great number of brilliantly colored\r\nelectric lights; which are skillfully grouped and interwoven, as a part\r\nof the general decorative plan. The wide seats, are designed for ease\r\nand comfort. They are richly and durably upholstered, with dark-brown,\r\npolished leather. The seating capacity of this cosey little theatre, is\r\ntwenty-five hundred.\r\n\r\nThe colonists have found this histrionic temple, very useful. It is an\r\nideal place for farm and village festivals; and for all kinds of\r\nentertainments; such as orations, school exhibitions, graduation\r\nexercises, vocal and instrumental concerts and dramas; lectures, operas\r\nand every class of theatricals. It is also, equally useful and fitting,\r\nfor stereopticon and biograph exhibits, of the astronomy, geology,\r\nbotany, natural history, microscopical, and photographic clubs.\r\n\r\nThe large, well equipped stage and dressing rooms, offer a permanent,\r\ndesirable home, for the musical, choral and dramatic clubs. At intervals\r\nof three months, four weeks in each year; excellent professional troups\r\noccupy the stage; presenting a fine variety, of wholesome dramas and\r\noperas. In this way, the stage of this farm theatre, is made to\r\nrepresent and reflect, the passing progress of the dramatic and operatic\r\nworld. During the intervals between these star-company weeks, the\r\nhome-talent club, presents regular, tri-weekly performances, under the\r\nsupervision of a skillful director. The remaining nights are as a rule,\r\npretty well utilized by the numerous local entertainments, before\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThis brief sketch of the generous provision, made for the education and\r\namusement of the people of Solaris, will, in connection with the nursery\r\nand kindergarten, hereafter to be described, show what the co-operative\r\nfarm can do, when it undertakes to give to its people a class of\r\neducational training and amusement, which in many respects, is superior\r\nto the best that money can buy for the wealthy. It will also\r\ndemonstrate, what can be accomplished, when the farm determines to\r\nproduce, and to fittingly educate and train, a superior class of\r\nchildren, as the most important part of the legitimate work of a\r\nco-operative farm. The highest expression of agriculture! The culture of\r\nchildren as a fine art! The production of such children, as will make\r\nideal citizens for a perfect Republic!\r\n\r\nThe practical class in farm chemistry, only twelve in number, is an\r\norganization made up by a careful selection from the brightest minds and\r\nbest thinkers in the colony. Under the leadership of Fillmore Flagg, it\r\nhas accomplished some excellent experimental work. It has been able to\r\nadd several valuable allied industries to the resources of the farm, in\r\naddition to those already described.\r\n\r\nIn breaking ground for opening the new mica and zinc mines, a great\r\nquantity of peculiar clay was discovered. This clay was of a very fine\r\nquality, entirely free from sand, gravel or other impurities. Yet,\r\nstrangely enough, it would not make good china, porcelain, or pottery!\r\nThere was a greasy smoothness of feeling possessed by this clay, which\r\nsuggested its name, tallow clay. After considerable exposure to the air,\r\nit would crack and slack until finally dissolved into a fine powder. The\r\nclass was puzzled. The members were on their mettle! The more they\r\nworked with this curious clay and failed, the more they became\r\ninterested and determined to persevere, until some discovery should\r\nreward them. The greasy quality of the clay, suggested soap-stone. Now,\r\nthe class members had long wished for some material out of which they\r\ncould manufacture a first-class quality of artificial soap-stone. This\r\ntallow clay promised good results, if they could only eliminate the few\r\nconstituents, which were not present in the real soap-stone. The weeks\r\nof careful research spent in this eliminating process, finally crowned\r\nthe efforts of the class with a complete success. The result, was an\r\nartificial soap-stone of excellent quality. Even, when molded in thin\r\nplates, it would withstand exposure to intense heat for long periods of\r\ntime, without warping or shrinking. It soon became evident, that it\r\ncould be made more useful and more valuable, than real soap-stone.\r\n\r\nAfter some weeks of experimental work, in various processes of\r\nmanufacture, the right method was reached. Fillmore Flagg was convinced,\r\nthat thousands of tons of this product, yielding a large profit, could\r\nbe placed on the market much cheaper than the best quality of fire\r\nbrick. For a great number of uses in the industrial arts, and for\r\nchemical furnaces, ore-roasting ovens, furnace linings, stove linings\r\nand even stoves, it would prove immeasurably superior. The popular\r\ndemand for this new soap-stone, soon sustained the judgment of Fillmore\r\nFlagg. This demand continued to increase until the new industry, became\r\none of the most profitable on the farm.\r\n\r\nAfter the first success, the class in farm chemistry, in search of\r\nanother prize, returned with renewed vigor, to attack the tallow clay.\r\nIn working over the formidable heap of tailings, which had accumulated\r\nfrom the soap-stone experiments, the second prize was quickly found. It\r\nproved even more important than the first! This mass of rejected clay\r\nwas found to be exceedingly rich in aluminum. Better still! It was just\r\nin the proper condition, to be most cheaply and easily extracted! It was\r\na great find! The class members were crowned with laurels! Of course,\r\nthey were jubilant. But they were not puffed up with pride! That, was\r\nnot their style!\r\n\r\nDuring the fifth year of the reign of the co-operative farm at Solaris,\r\nthe following mining industries, were added to its resources. Valuable\r\nmines of mica, lead and zinc, were opened and successfully worked.\r\nElectric car lines, connected these mines with the freight depot at\r\nSolaris Station. There, the lead and zinc, high grade ores, found a\r\nready market at good prices. The mica was prepared for use at Solaris.\r\nIt was then sold at a fine profit, in connection with orders for\r\nsoap-stone.\r\n\r\nFor two years, the canning factory, had furnished another avenue for\r\nprofitably marketing large crops of sweet-corn, green peas, asparagus,\r\ntomatoes, peaches, and many kinds of perishable fruits and berries.\r\n\r\nThe demand for Solaris Vegetable Concentrates, and for Solaris Mixture\r\nConcentrates, has more than doubled. The same is true of the Solaris\r\nbreakfast foods, and of the material for delicious breakfast dishes,\r\nprepared from mixtures of parched, sweet, and pop-corn.\r\n\r\nThe vineyards and the quince, peach, plum and cherry orchards, have\r\nreached the stage of full bearing. Improved methods, careful culture and\r\nthe constant use of better chemical agents, for the destruction of\r\ninsect enemies, have made the heavy crops of fruits from these vineyards\r\nand orchards, even more desirable and more salable than ever before. The\r\nfarm income from grapes and quinces alone amounting to over one hundred\r\nthousand dollars per annum.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of jellies, jams, preserves and marmalades, made from small\r\nfruits, has more than doubled. The excellence of quality, and\r\nestablished reputation for absolute purity, has rapidly increased the\r\ndemand for them at fancy prices.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the rapid and continuous growth of the farm income, from its\r\nallied agricultural and manufacturing industries, has largely increased\r\nthe wages of the co-operators. The purchases at the store have been\r\ncorrespondingly augmented. The sale of goods by the store, to\r\nsurrounding communities, has been greatly extended. The result has been\r\na constantly increasing volume of the seven and one-half per cent\r\nprofits, steadily pouring into the insurance fund. Both the general\r\nservice fund and the fund for purposes of education and amusement, have\r\nbeen equally benefited. Fifty thousand dollars, have been added to the\r\nstock of goods, in the store. The store building, has been enlarged and\r\nimproved. A large hotel for the accommodation of the constantly\r\nincreasing number of visitors, has been erected and equipped. At all\r\ntimes, plenty of money has been at hand, with which to push forward all\r\nnecessary farm or village improvements. The fame of such general\r\nprosperity, has gone abroad, in the land; placing the financial standing\r\nof the Solaris Farm Company, on a firm basis with the commercial world.\r\n\r\nFive years of co-operative work, have convinced the people of Solaris,\r\nthat successful agriculture, demands the determined effort, the best\r\nthought, the scientific work and the combined energy of a well organized\r\nforce of earnest, unselfish, steadfast workers. They are very\r\nenthusiastic over the wonderful results achieved. Freed from the\r\nshackles and sins of a selfish life, they bear the unmistakable stamp of\r\nprogress, socially, industrially, intellectually and ethically. Having\r\ncast aside the burden of care and worry about the future, both for\r\nthemselves and their children, they have had a chance to grow and expand\r\nin the real sunshine of life. They have become dignified, self-poised,\r\nwell dressed, educated, refined, cultured and polished men and women.\r\nGood citizens, of which, any commonwealth might well be proud! Vitally,\r\nand vastly more important! They have become dominant thinkers, who are\r\ncapable of wisely and unselfishly, thinking and planning for the benefit\r\nof the Republic!\r\n\r\nIn the remarkable success achieved by Solaris Farm, our hero, Fillmore\r\nFlagg, has realized his highest ambition, his brightest hopes. Relieved\r\nfrom further responsibility, as general manager, by the last annual\r\nelection of the Solaris Farm Company, he has had an opportunity to turn\r\nhis attention to organizing companies, for the eight remaining farm\r\nsites. In this work, he has had valuable assistance from the officers\r\nand members of the company. With a view of making Solaris the present\r\nheadquarters of the general movement; acting on advice of Fillmore\r\nFlagg, the Solaris Farm Company, has amended its charter, to increase\r\nthe membership of the company to one thousand; doubling the capital\r\nstock. Five thousand acres of adjoining lands have been secured, the\r\nfarmers from whom they were purchased, coming into the company as\r\nstock-holders. This course seemed necessary and wise, in order to\r\nproperly balance the growing industrial and commercial importance of\r\nSolaris. With such a large increase in the number of co-operators, a\r\nsurplus of capable young men and women, would be available, from which\r\nto select volunteers, as the nucleus of a corps of experienced officers\r\nfor the newly organized farm companies. In this way, Solaris, as the\r\nparent farm, would become very important as the training school, for\r\nteachers that were to supply the wants of such new farms as might grow\r\nout of the general movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE KINDERGARTEN AT SOLARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the important buildings at Solaris, we must consider the large,\r\nwell appointed nursery, kindergarten and mothers' club combined. The\r\nmothers' club occupying a handsome wing to the main building. Located\r\njust in the rear of the long row of palace homes, and connected with\r\nthem by a long, wide, many-windowed hall, it has proved admirably\r\nadapted to the purpose for which it was built. This beautiful structure,\r\nis environed by a lovely lawn, charmingly variegated with flowers and\r\nshrubbery. It is surrounded on three sides, by a wide, low veranda, only\r\none step above the lawn. This veranda, except where a broad step\r\nconnects it with the lawn, is shut in by a tall balustrade. By this\r\nmeans unguarded children are prevented from falling. A broad,\r\noverhanging roof, of picturesque design, covers the entire building.\r\nFrom the interior, many windows coming down to the floor, open on to the\r\nveranda.\r\n\r\nThe entire floor space, the full size of the main building, sixty by two\r\nhundred feet, is unobstructed by a partition. That portion devoted to\r\nthe nursery, is only separated from the kindergarten by a low\r\nbalustrade. A large skylight, in the central roof, floods this\r\nextraordinary room with an abundance of light. Screens of thin, white,\r\nsilky cloth are so arranged, that this light may be regulated and\r\nsoftened to any desired extent. The lofty ceiling is arched, groined and\r\ndecorated, very like a cathedral. The high walls are modestly tinted a\r\npale green. A broad, beautifully designed, exquisitely colored border,\r\nin perfect harmony with the splendor of the ceiling, runs uniformly\r\naround the upper walls of this delightful room, adding immensely to the\r\ngeneral artistic effect.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity in connection with the floor, marks a wide departure\r\nfrom the ordinary arrangements of a nursery or kindergarten school. Six\r\nfeet distant from the washboard, a depressed railway track, equipped\r\nwith long platform cars, ten feet in width, having their surfaces just\r\nlevel with the main floor, describes a circuit of the room. Except at\r\nthe places of entrance or exit, this circular train or section of floor\r\non wheels, is guarded on either side by a low railing. These railings\r\nalso extend across the cars, far enough from the ends to allow a four\r\nfoot passage between each one. In material and finish, the floor of the\r\ntrain is uniform with that of the room. The railings are all of polished\r\noak. Two cute little gates on each car open to the passage way at the\r\nends.\r\n\r\nThe machinery which propels this exaggerated perambulator, is run by\r\nelectric power. It is so adjusted, as to be perfectly under the control\r\nof the nurses and teachers in charge of the room. The iron frames from\r\nwhich fifty swinging cribs are hung, occupy considerable space on\r\nseveral cars. These cribs are for the exclusive use of infants, too\r\nyoung or too weak to sit up. The remaining space on the cars of this\r\ninfantile merry-go-round, which the mothers' club members have named the\r\nCargosita, is furnished with a remarkable variety of single and double\r\nseats, made low enough to be comfortable for children from eight to\r\nthirty months old. These seats are as artistic as they are unique! They\r\nrepresent on a small scale, ostriches, swans, geese, dogs, goats,\r\nhorses, mules, zebras, camels, elephants, tigers, and lions; wagons,\r\nphaetons, cycles, cars and a great variety of pleasure boats. The\r\nseating capacity of the cargosita is about three hundred, the number of\r\nchildren in the nursery and kindergarten, who are under four years of\r\nage. Older children become inmates of the regular schools.\r\n\r\nThe cargosita, when ornamented with a profusion of silk flags,\r\nresplendent with gaily colored ribbon streamers, handsome mats and a\r\nchoice collection of small potted plants, palms and flowers; becomes a\r\nthing of beauty, well calculated to capture and fascinate the childish\r\nheart. When the train is in motion, gaily spinning around this\r\nfive-hundred-foot oval; the cribs and seats filled with bright happy\r\nchildren, smiling and crowing, their chubby little hands clapping in\r\nunison with the measure of such exquisite music as is discoursed by a\r\ngiant orchestrion, or the electric piano, the vision becomes the\r\nloveliest and most inspiring one of a life time!\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the cargosita as an instrument for education, we find\r\nthat it is even more potent as such, than as a thing for amusement. For\r\nthe purpose of educating the senses, thus laying a sure foundation, for\r\na broad, healthy, harmonious, development of the mind, it is invaluable!\r\n\r\nA child is the repository of infinite possibilities! Education, is the\r\nprocess of unfolding these possibilities, in harmony with natural law.\r\nTo discover, and to apply this law, is the important work of the\r\neducator!\r\n\r\nTo Prof. Elmer Gates, and to his remarkable discoveries in Psychology\r\nand Psychurgy, the modern educator owes a heavy debt of gratitude! From\r\nthe teachings of Prof. Gates, we deduce; that in brain building, that\r\nprimary step in education, psychologic functioning creates organic\r\nstructure, and that organic structure is a manifestation in the\r\nconcrete, of the activities of the mind. In other words, that planted,\r\nwatered and nourished, by the emotions of the individual, the thoughts,\r\nideas, concepts and images which arise, create a corresponding growth of\r\ncell structure in the brain. That these brain cells become the working\r\ntools of the mind.\r\n\r\nIt follows then, that we cannot have thoughts, without first having\r\nsensations to form images and concepts, the soil out of which all\r\nthoughts naturally grow. Therefore, if in a practical way, all\r\npossibilities in the way of sensations, which may come through the\r\navenue of each one of the child's senses, are fully developed; a sure\r\nfoundation has been laid, for the largest possible development of brain\r\nand the corresponding growth of thought.\r\n\r\nIn the natural order of the growth of thought, nature prescribes the\r\nfollowing sequence: A union of sensations, produces images; a grouping\r\nof images, produces concepts; a relationing of concepts, produces ideas;\r\na generalizing of ideas, produces thoughts of the first order; a\r\ngeneralization of thoughts of the first order, produces thoughts of the\r\nsecond order: a still wider generalization of thoughts of the second\r\norder, produces thoughts of the third order; progressing in like manner,\r\nto the highest ladder of the mental scale.\r\n\r\nIn considering this order, we observe that sensations, form the base of\r\nthe educational pyramid. All knowledge which comes to the ego, the seat\r\nof consciousness, must come through sensations produced by contact with\r\nmaterial things in the domain of nature. Hence, as a primary step in\r\neducational work, a careful training of the senses, becomes a matter of\r\nthe greatest importance. This training cannot be commenced, without\r\nfirst ascertaining what these senses are, and the natural order of their\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nCommencing with the lowest, we have muscle feelings, or the sense of\r\nmusculation; the sense of touch, the sense of pressure, the sense of\r\nwarmth, the sense of cold, the sense of smell, the sense of taste, the\r\nsense of hearing and the sense of seeing. Altogether, we have nine\r\nimportant avenues, through which the inner man may gain a correct\r\nknowledge of the outer world.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gates has discovered a system of sense training, which may be\r\nsuccessfully applied to kindergarten children. In application, only a\r\nfew minutes daily practice by each child, is required. By this training,\r\nin extending the upper and lower thresholds of sensation, the capacity\r\nof each sense, may be doubled from five to eight times. To the\r\ninexperienced, this proposition is so stupendous, that it seems almost\r\nunthinkable! However, we may state parenthetically, that an application\r\nof this system, to children in the Solaris kindergarten, has shown such\r\nmarvelous results, that its efficacy and excellence have been well\r\nestablished. It has proved fully equal to the demands of twentieth\r\ncentury progress!\r\n\r\nTurning again to the teachings of Prof. Gates, we learn that mind is the\r\nkey-stone and the arch of life, the all-containing attribute, which\r\ncombines all forms of its expression: that to properly cultivate the\r\nmind, is to extend the scope and usefulness of life. Hence, that in\r\nchoosing a system of education, which will be in harmony with planetary\r\nevolution, therefore, the easiest and most natural. We must never lose\r\nsight of one great, central, primal fact. It is this. The mind of the\r\nchild, which is to be unfolded, is the production of the cosmic\r\nuniverse; therefore, cannot be in fundamental antagonism with it. It\r\nfollows, then, that if children gather their sensations, images,\r\nconcepts, ideas, and thoughts, directly from the phenomena of that\r\nuniverse, they will acquire a kind of knowledge, so real, so superior,\r\nthat it will stand the test of an eternity. It is actual knowledge!\r\nThere is no theory, no speculation, no guesswork about it!\r\n\r\nThe sciences, are facts regarding the phenomena of the universe,\r\nclassified and arranged in an orderly manner. All facts of every kind,\r\nnaturally fall into the domain of some one of the sciences.\r\n\r\nMan, as the highest expression of the planet, in his three-fold nature,\r\nbecomes the gleaner, the classifier, and the repository of these facts.\r\nA beautiful exposition of the clever handiwork, of the law of action and\r\nre-action. As a cosmic unit of the larger cosmos, the more perfect his\r\nknowledge of the universe, the more complete, is his store of knowledge\r\nin relation to himself.\r\n\r\nChildren, in order to become properly equipped students, must, when\r\nready to take up the sciences, be prepared to determine what the actual\r\nsensations are, out of which the different possible images of the\r\nsciences are composed. To achieve the most thorough education possible,\r\nthey must know the actual number of concepts in each science, and\r\nprecisely the images out of which they have arisen! They will then be\r\nprepared, to collect and classify, the mentative data of the sciences.\r\nThat is, they will be able to determine for themselves, experimentally,\r\nthe sensations, images, concepts, ideas and thoughts, which belong to\r\neach one.\r\n\r\nPractice in this useful training, will lead the pupil, to the higher,\r\nwider generalizations of thought, which belong to the domain of pure\r\nreason. In the work of classification, by detecting differences, a\r\nknowledge of the inductive process is gained. Similarly, by detecting\r\nlikenesses, a knowledge of deductive reasoning is acquired.\r\n\r\nThe body, like the brain, being composed of a co-operative colony of\r\nmore or less intelligent cells, is an important part of the mind, which\r\nresponds to educational training. True education, then is a development\r\nof both mind and body, in accord with the law of natural evolution, that\r\nembraces all there is in the domain of morals, pertaining to right\r\nthinking, right living and right doing. In other words, the action of\r\nthe mind comprehends the physical, intellectual, moral and spiritual\r\nexpression of the individual. Therefore, by the rightly conducted\r\nprocesses of a higher education, we may form an evenly developed\r\ncharacter of the highest order. A character, unfolded physically,\r\nintellectually and spiritually, in harmony with the requirements of\r\ncosmic law. Hence, the imperative necessity, in the early training of\r\nchildren, of introducing the first steps of this system of true\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nFrom these premises we must conclude, that the first four years of a\r\nchild's life, should be devoted to some systematic method, for acquiring\r\na most complete equipment of exact images, which will afford the basis\r\nfor typical sensations, emotions, ideas and thoughts, regarding things\r\nin the domain of nature, about which, later in life, the child must\r\nknow in order to become educated. To this end, children must have\r\nopportunities during these important years of image building, to\r\nexperience all the sensations, and to form all the true images, that can\r\ncome to them through the senses of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling,\r\ntouching, feeling and sensations of temperature, such as heat and cold.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance, that these early images, which are to\r\nbecome the standard of the mind, in all judgments of future years;\r\nshould be made as complete and as perfect as possible.\r\n\r\nA child is primarily and instinctively imitative. From the first dawn of\r\nintelligence, children strive to emulate the acts of their brighter,\r\nolder and better-taught associates. Hence, the necessity for a nursery\r\nand kindergarten training, such as the one instituted at Solaris.\r\nPractical work, in this novel and magnificently equipped institution,\r\nhas proved conclusively, that, even in early infancy, associated\r\ntogether in happy groups, children acquire intellectual, moral and\r\nphysical training, much more easily and swiftly, than is possible under\r\nany other circumstances. This affords another demonstration, of the\r\nefficacy of co-operative group work, in the primary steps of education.\r\n\r\nThe cargosita, is well calculated to offer children the most perfect\r\nconditions, for accumulating a well selected store of sensations and\r\nimages, through the avenues of the different senses. A teacher or nurse,\r\nusually some member of the mothers' club, is seated on each car as the\r\ncenter of its group. It becomes her pleasure, to direct attention to the\r\nvarious objects. Let us follow the cargosita with its precious freight,\r\nas it slowly moves around the oval.\r\n\r\nImages produced by the sense of seeing, are first in order. Large\r\nsheets of thick, heavy paper mounted on cloth, seven in number,\r\ndisplaying the different colors of the rainbow, are hung at uniform\r\nintervals around the room. They can be raised or lowered, to reach an\r\neasy angle of vision from the cars. After each primary color, appear\r\nhalf-width sheets of the same height, displaying the various hues, tints\r\nand shades of that particular color. Printed across each sheet in large\r\nwhite letters, is the name of the color, hue, tint or shade. Altogether,\r\nthis color scheme forms a combination of great length, of such\r\nremarkable variety, that it becomes for the little ones, a well nigh\r\ninexhaustable source of fascinating amusement.\r\n\r\nRed, with its various hues, tints and shades, is the first color to be\r\nexhibited. Three days later, another color series is substituted. This\r\ncourse is continued until the entire series is finished. The children\r\nhave experienced in a regular sequence, the sensations and images,\r\nproduced by the entire scale of color. These mental pictures have been\r\nrepeated so often, in connection with the muscular sense of exhilarating\r\nmotion, that they have become permanently enregistered in brain-cell\r\nformation. A review every few months, serves to fix these images more\r\nfirmly in the brain.\r\n\r\nThis primary course of educative work is continued, by taking up\r\nconsecutively, in regular order; on a separate series of sheets, life\r\nsize, naturally colored photographs, of fishes, reptiles, insects,\r\nbirds, animals, and people. Later, geological specimens, glass, rocks\r\nand minerals. To be followed by pictures of life in the vegetable\r\nkingdom, flowers, fruits, plants and trees. Again, with photographs of\r\nworks of art, paintings and statuary.\r\n\r\nInterspersed with this general course, are short lessons, offered to\r\nproduce true images, in the hearing, smelling and tasting areas of the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nFirst, by repeating at different times, while the cargosita is in\r\nmotion, with its cargo of infantile passengers, all of the best musical\r\ncompositions, executed vocally, and on the electric piano, the giant\r\norchestrion, the violin, and a great variety of other musical\r\ninstruments. These lessons in hearing, are repeated and varied, until\r\nthe children have become familiar with most of the sounds in the tone\r\nscale. The mental sound images produced, have been associated with the\r\nhappy scenes of this merry kindergarten life. By this interweaving of\r\npleasant sensations, they have become more firmly fixed in a healthy\r\ngroup of brain cells, thus planted and established in the hearing areas\r\nof the brain.\r\n\r\nSecond: In a similar manner, the taste sensations and images, are\r\nproduced and registered. Day after day, one by one, tiny packages of\r\nconfections, beautifully wrapped in brilliantly colored papers, are\r\ngiven to the children while on their cargosita excursions. These\r\ninteresting lessons are continued, until the entire range of savors has\r\nbeen exhausted. The curiosity, excitement, pleasure and eagerness\r\nexhibited by children, in these tasting investigations, is something\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\nThird: Flowers, beautiful flowers of all kinds, are largely used in\r\nproducing sensations and images, to be registered in the brain areas of\r\nthe sense of smell. The essence of odors which cannot be gotten from\r\nflowers, are used to saturate small sachet bags, of charming color and\r\nartistic design. These bags make attractive play-things for the\r\nchildren. While using them they soon, unconsciously, become very\r\nskillful in detecting the slightest differences between the various\r\nodors. Brain areas usually left barren, are now filled and developed.\r\n\r\nLater in life, when children come to study the different sciences, this\r\nability to detect the presence of the slightest odor, becomes\r\ninvaluable, in the difficult work of classification. With such an\r\nunusual equipment, they will be far in advance of those pupils, who have\r\nnot wisely, left uncultivated this important sense of smelling.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the regular course of exercises, prescribed for\r\nthird- and fourth-year children, there is introduced in the play and work\r\nrooms of the kindergarten, a special training, designed to develop the\r\nvarious sensations of heat and cold: changes in temperature, from one\r\nextreme to the other: sensitiveness to touch: to recognize any degree of\r\npressure, from zero to the violence of pain: ability to detect size,\r\nlength, breadth, and thickness: degrees of smoothness, elasticity, and\r\nhardness: all through the senses of touch, pressure, and muscular\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nInteresting plays are invented for the children, into which, these\r\nexercises are skillfully introduced. These plays, have a peculiar\r\nfascination. They excite an intense interest, which seems to always\r\nattract and hold the child's attention, until there is enregistered, in\r\nregular sequence, in the touch areas of the brain, all the sensations\r\nand images, which can be produced by many weeks of training, in this\r\nsystematic course.\r\n\r\nThe training of the senses, is also carried forward through the medium\r\nof such plays as are calculated to bring out the child's capacity to\r\ndistinguish the least noticeable difference, in pitches of color,\r\ndegrees of light, pitches of sound, with its degrees of volume and\r\nloudness; together, with ability to discover the least noticeable\r\ndifference, in resistance to pressure, or the slightest increase or\r\ndecrease of rythmical motion, etc. The lines of least noticeable\r\ndifference, in the capacity of the various senses, having been well\r\nestablished, the training commences along those lines. Very soon, in the\r\nbrain areas of the senses under training, there comes an increased cell\r\ngrowth, which gives added sharpness and capacity. The line of least\r\nnoticeable difference, is moved one step nearer the limit. This process\r\nis continued with each sense separately, until the limit for all has\r\nbeen reached. As a general result of this training, we find that the\r\nchild has acquired an extraordinary reinforcement of brain power and\r\nintellectual acuteness.\r\n\r\nRegular kindergarten work, for children at Solaris, between two and four\r\nyears of age; is again reinforced, by adding to the list of exercises, a\r\nlarge number of plays, which introduce the variously colored, lettered\r\nblocks, so successfully used in Fern Fenwick's early training, during\r\nher seven years of Alaska life.\r\n\r\nThe collection of blocks, is a very large one. It is calculated to\r\nfurnish a series of new combinations, which cannot be exhausted, in the\r\nplays of one whole year. These blocks are made and colored with the\r\ngreatest care. The groups or families, are distinguished, by size, shape\r\nand color. The Alphabet blocks, are large cubes, painted white, with the\r\nletter showing in black on every side. All other blocks, have a uniform\r\nthickness of one-half inch. They are as large as can be fashioned from\r\nblocks two inches square. The names appear in white letters, on all\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nThe astronomy blocks are star shaped, painted blue. The geology blocks\r\nare diamond shaped, painted brown. The chemistry blocks are hexagonal in\r\nshape, painted red. The geography blocks are globular in shape, painted\r\ngray. The blocks representing physics, are octagon shaped, painted\r\nyellow. The botany blocks are oblong, painted green. The physiology\r\nblocks are triangular in shape, painted pink. The history blocks are\r\nsquare, painted black. A large number of the key-words of the sciences,\r\nare painted on blocks, which, in size, shape and color, are counterparts\r\nof those that represent the heads of families to which they belong.\r\n\r\nThis scheme of blocks, furnishes the ground work for the construction of\r\na great number of games, for the amusement and edification of the\r\nchildren. Games of word-building, such as spelling out the names of\r\nfishes, insects, reptiles, birds and animals. Also of building the names\r\nof familiar things, houses, stables, light-houses, factories and mills;\r\nrivers, ponds, lakes, mountains, trees and fields; hats, shoes, coats,\r\ncloaks and other articles of clothing; common household utensils in\r\nevery day use, such as pots, kettles, pans, pails, cups, knives, forks\r\nand spoons; stove, shovel, tongs, mop and broom; toys, dolls, balls,\r\nkites, tops, etc.\r\n\r\nBy the use of many such ingenious games, the children unconsciously\r\nbecome familiar with the names of the sciences, and with all the\r\nprincipal words, which belong to each one. For example: Names of\r\nheavenly bodies in the domain of astronomy. The sun, the moon, the milky\r\nway, the planets, the constellations, the polar star, and the names of\r\ntwenty stars of the greatest magnitude: In the domain of geology,\r\nfossils, shells, minerals, rocks, shales, clays, gravels, and the names\r\nof geological periods: In the domain of chemistry, the names of acids,\r\ngases, metals, crucibles, retorts, mortars, and the names of a great\r\nvariety of chemical combinations: In the domain of geography, globes,\r\nhemispheres, continents, islands, oceans, gulfs, bays, and straits;\r\nequator, tropics, circles, longitude, latitude, etc. These examples,\r\nwill furnish an approximate idea of the wide scope in scientific names,\r\ncovered by these key-words, when applied to all of the sciences.\r\n\r\nIn such plays of science grouping, the interest and pleasure of the\r\nchildren is intensified, by applying a system of personification, to the\r\nfamilies of the different sciences: For instance, Mr. Astronomy Blue;\r\nMrs. Geology Brown; Mr. Chemistry Red; Mrs. Geography Gray, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the greatest and most useful of all games, the game of\r\nclassification: Groups of children, spend hours with their teachers or\r\ndirectors, in separating and classifying, heaps of miscellaneous blocks,\r\nbearing the names of the sciences and the key-words belonging thereto.\r\nThey are silent, absorbed, contented, thoroughly interested and happy.\r\nSo intense is the interest displayed, that after the fourth or fifth\r\ngame, every child can correctly classify the blocks, by quickly placing\r\nthem in the groups to which they belong. They rapidly learn to call the\r\nname at sight, which is printed on any block they may happen to pick up.\r\nThose who have not learned to read by playing word-building games with\r\nthe alphabet blocks, only need to have an unfamiliar name, repeated to\r\nthem three or four times by the director, and it is fixed. Size, shape\r\nand color of block, with length of name and shape of its letters, soon\r\nserves to make the little ones, perfect masters of the most difficult\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThese children have learned the value of time. They have learned to\r\nappreciate the joyousness of useful amusement. They have no desire to\r\nclog their minds, with the untruthful trash of fairy tales and Mother\r\nGoose stories, which played such an important part in nineteenth century\r\nmethods. They no longer need such silly things, as a source of\r\namusement. They seem to realize, that they only have mind-room, for the\r\ntruthful, the useful and the practical.\r\n\r\nThe value and significance of figures, is taught by the game of forming\r\nthe pyramid. On badges of broad, blue ribbon, are printed large gold\r\nfigures, from one to ten. Inside the oval, in the center of the large\r\nroom, ten rows of seats are arranged: with one seat in the first, and\r\nten in the last row. That is, one seat is added to each succeeding row.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the game, when number one is called by the\r\ndirector, the little boy or girl, who is decorated with the badge\r\nbearing that number, takes the first seat, which forms the apex of the\r\npyramid. The two children who wear number two badges; when called take\r\nseats in the second row. Observing this order, the calling is continued\r\nuntil the seats are filled, and the pyramid of fifty-five children is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThe director, having taken a position a short distance in front of the\r\napex of the pyramid, proceeds to call the children to their feet.\r\nCalling by number, commencing with the tens, the rows rise in\r\nsuccession, from the base to the apex. Each row is called upon to\r\nperform some part of a short series of graceful gymnastics. Then, the\r\nwhole group in unison. Later, these exercises are made more\r\ninteresting, by giving each child a small silk flag. In this part of the\r\ngame, the children are at their best. The picture they make, is just\r\nlovely!\r\n\r\nIn the closing part of the game, the children are seated and the\r\nmathematical exercises are introduced. The director says: \"Each child\r\nhas one nose. How many noses, have the number tens? Again, each child\r\nhas one body. How many bodies, have the number nines? Each child has two\r\neyes. How many eyes, have the number eights? Each child has two ears.\r\nHow many ears, have the number sevens? Each child has one mouth. How\r\nmany mouths, have the number sixes? Each child has two arms. How many\r\narms, have the number fives? Each child has two hands. How many hands,\r\nhave the number fours? Each child has two legs. How many legs, have the\r\nnumber threes? Each child has two feet. How many feet, have the number\r\ntwos? Each child has ten fingers and ten toes. How many fingers and\r\ntoes, has number one?\" These questions are varied and repeated, day\r\nafter day, until every child in the pyramid, can answer any one of the\r\nquestions, correctly and promptly. To be chosen as a member of this\r\ngame, is a coveted honor, it is conferred as a reward for good conduct.\r\nConsequently, the pride and pleasure exhibited by these decorated and\r\nselected children, is commensurate with the importance of this very\r\nprimitive class in mathematics and physiology.\r\n\r\nThis very brief outline, of the plays, exercises and studies, which form\r\nthe nursery and kindergarten course, for children at Solaris, who are\r\nunder four years of age, will serve to show how much important\r\nknowledge, a child can accumulate during those fruitful image-bearing\r\nyears, while pleasantly and zealously engaged, day after day, in a\r\nseries of wisely directed games.\r\n\r\nIn playing these games, the children have become interested in, and have\r\nlearned a very large number of useful words. These words in the mind of\r\nthe child, are as familiar and as easily remembered, as are the names of\r\nfavorite toys, such as balls, bats, kites and dolls. This wide\r\nvocabulary of key-words which has become the mental property of the\r\nchild, has planted in the mind the necessary images, which in future\r\nyears of study, will serve as a sure foundation, for the quick and easy\r\nmastery of all branches of useful knowledge. Many a man of the world has\r\ngone through life, without acquiring such a vocabulary.\r\n\r\nConsidering this primary course of study from another point of view, we\r\nhave an illustration of the value of a method for cultivating the\r\nfaculty of memory, which differs widely from any thing known to ordinary\r\nsystems of education. From this illustration, we perceive that the\r\nperfectness and permanency of memory, is dependent on the foundations\r\nwhich have been laid for it, by the quantity and quality of sensations\r\nand images, regarding the things to be remembered, which have been\r\nregistered or planted in brain-cell formation. These living images,\r\nfixed on the sensitive plate of the brain by the law of vibration, in a\r\nmanner somewhat analogous to etching on the cylinders of a phonograph,\r\nare capable of being reproduced by the will-force of the individual.\r\nFrom these premises, we have gained a new definition for the word\r\nmemory. It is a process of refunctioning or reregistering, any\r\nsensation, image, concept, idea, or thought, which at any time has\r\nbecome a part of the growth of the brain.\r\n\r\nIn the child's mind, memories regarding objects or words which have\r\nbecome familiar, are as a rule, closely connected with memories of keen\r\nenjoyment, resulting from participation in some childish sport. These\r\nmemories are many times repeated. A few small groups of brain cells have\r\nbecome dominant in growth, because they have received the full force of\r\nthe entire stimulating power of the brain. Hence, the memories of\r\nchildhood, are much more enduring than those of after life. Hence, it\r\nbecomes a matter of the utmost importance, that these early images,\r\nshould be connected with the greatest possible number of natural\r\nobjects, their names, and the key-words of the sciences, which are used\r\nto describe them.\r\n\r\nIn these restless years for the little ones, it becomes a matter of\r\ngreat moment, to keep their minds busily employed, at what appeals to\r\ntheir self-consciousness, as some useful work. In this respect, the\r\npopular science games, gratify and completely satisfy the pride and\r\ndignity of these embryo men and women. The mind is naturally unfolded.\r\nThe brain areas, are all evenly and harmoniously developed. The\r\nchildren, when so usefully employed, are kept amiable. They do not\r\nbecome nervous, irritable, cross, or vicious. They are taught, as soon\r\nas they can walk and talk, that the self-respect and innate dignity,\r\nwhich belongs to them as little men and little women, demands that they\r\nshould always treat each other lovingly, politely, kindly, unselfishly.\r\nIt is continually urged upon them, that they must learn to obey the\r\nnurse or teacher, without delay, without a murmur; that they must not\r\ncry or be fretful; that in these things, they must always strive to\r\nimitate the good acts of older comrades or playmates. In this way, the\r\nmoral unfoldment and education of the child, keeps pace with the\r\nintellectual and the physical. Altogether, the effect is most excellent!\r\nThousands of children have gone to ruin, for the want of just such\r\ntraining, in the first four years of life!\r\n\r\nThe planning and final organization, of this novel scheme for nursery\r\nand kindergarten training, has been the joint work of Fern Fenwick,\r\nFillmore Flagg, Gertrude and George Gerrish. In striving for the best\r\nresults, this quartet of co-operative educators, have been ambitious to\r\nperfect a system, which would satisfy the demand for a natural,\r\nharmonious unfoldment of the well-born babies, which were to represent\r\nthe highest product of Solaris Farm.\r\n\r\nThe success which has attended the practical operation of the scheme,\r\nhas made them very happy. Towards this success, Fern Fenwick has been\r\nable to contribute largely, on account of her early Alaska training, and\r\nher thorough knowledge of the improved methods, growing out of the\r\nimportant discoveries made by Prof. Gates.\r\n\r\nIn applying the system to the class work of the regular schools, the\r\nlong experience, trained skill and natural aptitude as teachers, of\r\nGeorge and Gertrude Gerrish, has proved wonderfully effective.\r\n\r\nBy supplementing the system, with a very complete course of manual\r\ntraining in the use of tools, and in acquiring a competent knowledge of\r\nthe industrial arts, Fillmore Flagg has been equally successful, in\r\neducating the muscular children, and in arming them most effectively,\r\nboth mentally and physically, for the practical work of life.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the complete course, results in an all-round development of\r\nbrain power, more than five times greater than that offered by any other\r\nsystem. A result, which marks the beginning of a new educational era. A\r\nresult, which promises to give to the world, a dominant race of\r\nthinkers, whose ability to bless mankind, is to be so great, that it\r\ncannot now be estimated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nAN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1911, six years after our first introduction to\r\nhim, we find our hero, Fillmore Flagg, seated in his private office at\r\nSolaris. This office was located in a building on the public square,\r\nnear the store, which has been especially designed and constructed, for\r\nuse as the central office for the general co-operative, farm movement.\r\nHere, Fillmore Flagg, has been busily engaged for more than two months,\r\nin planning the preliminary work for eight new farms. For the moment, he\r\nseems absorbed in a dreamy reverie. From this, he was sharply aroused by\r\nthe entrance of a messenger, who announced a visitor. The visitor proved\r\nto be none other, than our old acquaintance, George Gaylord. The\r\ngreetings, exchanged between these re-united college chums, were cordial\r\nindeed! In the conversations which are to follow, the reader will find a\r\ncontinuation of the story of Solaris Farm.\r\n\r\n\"Shades of venus! How well you are looking, Fillmore! I need not ask\r\nhow you have fared since last we met! One look at your face, tells the\r\nwhole story! The goddess of good fortune, must have smiled on you right\r\nroyally! I congratulate you most heartily! The fame of your exploits\r\nhere at Solaris, has reached New England! What a lovely village you have\r\nmade! And the farm too, is just delightful! To behold it, is well worth\r\nthe price of a long journey! Of course, at some convenient time, you are\r\nto show me the farm, and tell me all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you George, for your congratulations; You have surmised\r\ncorrectly! I have been prospered, far beyond my most sanguine\r\nexpectations! At the proper time, I shall take pleasure in relating the\r\nwhole story for your benefit. Now, I am anxious to hear something\r\nregarding yourself. Tell me, my dear fellow! To what piece of good\r\nfortune, do I owe this unexpected visit? And, may I hope, that the\r\ngoddess you just mentioned, has been equally gracious with her smiles\r\nfor you!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a long story, Fillmore, and I can assure you it is not a pleasant\r\none. It seems a pity to mar your peace of mind by relating such a\r\nmiserable tale of woe! During the past five years, the unkind fates have\r\nfrowned upon me, and I have suffered much! In order to give you an\r\nintelligent reason for my visit to Solaris, I must tell you of some\r\ngood, and many bitter things which have transpired, since we parted at\r\nthe hotel on Mount Meenahga.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really! George, I am sorry for your misfortunes! But surmising so much\r\nfrom your preparatory statement, I now wish to know all that you can\r\nconsistently tell me. For the bitterness and suffering, you have my\r\nsympathy in advance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you Fillmore! I knew that I could rely on your sympathy and\r\nfriendship, under all circumstances. Please pardon any lack of coherence\r\nor orderly arrangement of details, in what I am about to relate.\r\n\r\n\"Late in the month of November, which followed our parting in the\r\nmountains, in accordance with previous arrangements, I took charge of\r\nthe church in the New England city, where my uncle George resided. My\r\nrelations with the members of the congregation, proved as pleasant as\r\ncould be desired. I became acquainted with Martha Merritt, my uncle's\r\nniece by marriage. She was a beautiful girl! Very winning, sweet and\r\namiable. I soon became fond of her company. This seemed to please both\r\nmy uncle and my mother. I could see that they had set their hearts on a\r\nmarriage between Martha and myself.\r\n\r\n\"About the middle of the following January, acting on a suggestion from\r\nuncle George, I asked Martha for her hand in marriage. After taking a\r\nwhole week for consideration, she finally consented and we were engaged.\r\nSome days later, I urged her to name an early day for our wedding. Very\r\nmuch to my surprise, she said 'You must not hurry me, George! You must\r\ngive me time!' I hastened to assure her that I did not wish to be\r\ninconsiderate, and begged her to take another week, in which to fix the\r\ndate. During this time, I saw very little of Martha. In the brief\r\ninterviews that followed, she was pale and agitated. At the end of the\r\nweek, again her old-time self, she came to me with the news that our\r\nwedding day had been fixed for the fifteenth of June, five months\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\n\"Early in February, the clouds of disaster began to gather. My mother\r\nwas confined to her bed with what proved to be a serious illness. After\r\nfour months of almost constant suffering, which she bore with the\r\npatience and fortitude of a martyr, she was borne across the dark water,\r\nto join that vast majority, that silent, mysterious, ever increasing\r\nhost of the buried dead.\r\n\r\n\"My mother was buried on the fifteenth of June. Overwhelmed with grief,\r\nI readily assented to Martha's suggestion, that our wedding should be\r\npostponed until the first of October. Recovering slowly from the shock\r\nof my bereavement, I turned eagerly to Martha, for loving consolation. I\r\nwas horrified, to find that her affection for me had turned to\r\nill-concealed aversion! There was a terror-stricken, haunted look in her\r\neyes, as she strove in every possible way, to avoid being left alone\r\nwith me even for a moment, which frightened and almost crushed me with\r\ngrief. I knew that something dreadful, must have happened! She was so\r\npitiful to behold, that I could not be angry or jealous! But, I resolved\r\nto know the truth. At the first opportunity, I demanded an explanation.\r\nBursting into tears, she told me the story of her bitter experience.\r\n\r\n\"Falling on her knees beside my chair, Martha implored me to be\r\nmerciful. 'George,' she said, 'I know that I am the most wretched, and\r\nthe most desperately wicked girl on the face of the earth! You have been\r\nso kind, and I have treated you so shamefully! How, can you ever forgive\r\nme? The only reparation that I can now make, is to tell you the whole\r\ntruth, without reservation. Ten months before I saw you, while I was at\r\nschool near Boston, I met Phillip Plato. The fates would have it, that\r\nwe should fall desperately in love with each other, at our first\r\nmeeting. In a short time we were engaged. In entering into this\r\nengagement, I did so without the knowledge of my uncle, or any friend. I\r\ndid not stop for a moment, to consider my duty to uncle George, who had\r\nalways been so good to me. I could think of no one but Phillip, and of\r\nmy love for him. In the delirium of love's first dream, the weeks passed\r\nas days! Alas! The dream was passing brief! Somehow, Phillip's parents\r\nbecame aware of our engagement. They were very wealthy, and exceedingly\r\nambitious to have Phillip marry more wealth. Angry with him, they came\r\nto me and cruelly declared, that they would never allow him to wed such\r\na fortuneless girl! With look and gesture of scorn, they told me that\r\nthey were just on the eve of going abroad, taking Phillip for two years\r\nof travel, in which they should strive to cure him completely of his\r\ninsane infatuation. This, then was the end of my romance. My cruelly\r\nwounded pride, rose up in rebellion. I was furious! I returned scorn for\r\nscorn! I bade them begone!\r\n\r\n\"'I returned to my uncle's home, my heart hot with the indignation of an\r\noutraged pride, and filled with a determination, to show to the world no\r\nsign, but to use all my strength of will, to cast Phillip out of my\r\nlife; to utterly forget him and his selfish, greedy, heartless parents.\r\nWhen you came, George, I was more anxious than ever before, to please my\r\nuncle in every possible way. I foolishly imagined, that in encouraging\r\nyour attentions as a lover, I was helping myself, to forget my love for\r\nPhillip. Oh! What a terrible, cruel mistake! How terrible, how cruel, I\r\nwas soon to realize. You will remember, George, how strangely I behaved\r\nat that interview, in which you asked me to fix the day for our\r\nwedding. Let me explain. A few hours previous, while I was lost in one\r\nof my occasional fits of melancholy moping, the voice of Phillip came to\r\nmy ears with startling distinctness. The voice said Martha, you must\r\nremain true to me! I love you as devotedly as ever! I am determined,\r\nnever to give you up! I am coming home to wed you! I am surely coming!\r\nWait for me! These words kept ringing in my ears, like the tolling of a\r\nfuneral bell. They thrilled me through and through! The barriers of my\r\npride gave way. The returning tide of my love for Phillip, swept in upon\r\nme with such force, that my heart almost ceased to beat! I was faint,\r\ndeadly faint! When I recovered consciousness and afterwards, at our\r\ninterview, I was absolutely wretched! Your request, added to my anguish.\r\nI was powerless to answer, I could only beg for more time. All through\r\nthat dreadful week, I strove to convince myself that my ears had\r\ndeceived me, that the voice was not real, only a phasma, a\r\nhallucination, born of my fits of melancholy. Unfortunately, I finally\r\nsucceeded!\r\n\r\n\"'Now, George, you shall hear the sequel, the climax of my wretchedness.\r\nThe day before your mother died, I received a long letter from Phillip.\r\nIt was written at Rome. Every line of that letter, was eloquent with\r\nPhillip's steadfast devotion, and love for me. In brief, a complete\r\nverification of what the warning voice had told me. His parents had\r\nrelented. He was coming home to make me his bride. He had planned to\r\narrive at Boston, in time to celebrate the New Year. He spoke of a long\r\nletter, which he had written to me, just on the eve of his going abroad.\r\nIn that letter he had assured me of his undying love, of his\r\ndetermination never to give me up. In closing, he had begged me to wait\r\nfor him, to remain true to him. He had repeated its contents, because he\r\nhad been constantly haunted with the idea that the letter in question,\r\nhad failed to reach me. And so it had.\r\n\r\n\"'This, George, is the summing up of my misery! It has filled my heart\r\nwith the anguish of despair! I can never love anyone but Phillip! I\r\ncannot marry you, George! I cannot! It would be an unpardonable sin\r\nagainst you, against my own soul! What shall I do? What can I do? What\r\natonement can I ever make, for the shame, the humiliation, the\r\nsuffering, which I have brought into your life?'\r\n\r\n\"In this brief sketch, Fillmore, you have the substance of Martha's sad\r\nstory. I believe it was absolutely true. I was deeply moved, by her\r\nabject misery and humiliation. A great wave of tender sympathy, swelled\r\nin my heart; blotting out all thoughts of self. I gave her back her\r\nengagement, and bade her go free; free to marry whomsoever her heart had\r\nchosen; assured of my forgiveness, and of my wish for her future\r\nhappiness. I need not repeat her grateful thanks. From this time\r\nforward, our lives were widely separated.\r\n\r\n\"During the long tedious months that followed, I was going through a\r\nbitter, humiliating experience. I strove by every effort to so interest\r\nmyself in my church work, that I might forget my griefs and my\r\ndisappointments. In this, I failed utterly. I found to my amazement,\r\nthat I did not possess a thorough belief or confidence, in the efficacy\r\nof the atonement, the very ground work of the entire scheme of Christian\r\nsalvation. Without this belief, I could not hope to do effective work in\r\nthe ministry. No doubt, this was the cause of my lack of interest in my\r\npastoral duties; the one thing, during this time of trials, which most\r\ndisturbed my mental equilibrium, and added to the intensity of my\r\nsufferings. My growing antipathy towards all kinds of church work, daily\r\nincreased the mental tension, caused by anxious seasons of watching,\r\npraying, and fighting, against the farther dominancy of this monstrous\r\nantipathy. All opposing efforts proved useless. With each succeeding\r\nweek, my Sunday services became more burdensome, more perfunctory, more\r\nunsatisfactory, more self-accusing. At last, in self defense, the church\r\ntrustees proposed my taking a year's vacation, for recuperation.\r\n\r\n\"This welcome respite, I gladly accepted. My vacation, is now nearly\r\nfinished. I cannot go back to my church. I do not wish to go. I realize,\r\nthat I am wholly unfitted for its duties. I feel, that I have made life\r\na failure! In fact, Fillmore, you see before you in your friend George\r\nGaylord, a man who is aimlessly drifting on the sea of life, like a ship\r\nwithout a rudder. A man not yet thirty, without a home, without\r\nambition, hope or purpose! Possibly, I may be in the clutches of some\r\napproaching attack of nervous prostration, I hope not, I am sure!\r\n\r\n\"You must pardon my prolixity, Fillmore. I will now give you the reason\r\nfor my present visit to Solaris. After my mother became very ill, some\r\nweeks before her death, she received a letter from Caroline Houghton, a\r\nlife long friend, an old schoolmate. At that time, Mrs. Houghton was\r\nresiding in a small town near Denver, Colorado. She was a widow with\r\nscant means of support; with only one child, a daughter. Mrs. Houghton,\r\nin her letter, said: 'I am dying among strangers! I am leaving my\r\ndarling daughter alone in the world, without money, without relatives;\r\nsimply in charge of recently acquired friends. As a last request, I beg\r\nyou, after I am gone to exercise a protecting care over my orphaned\r\nchild!'\r\n\r\n\"This letter worried my mother greatly. I think if she had been well,\r\nshe would have hurried to Mrs. Houghton's bedside. After some delay, she\r\nfinally turned the letter over to me to answer. Just at that time, my\r\nmind was wholly preoccupied with preparations for my fast approaching\r\nwedding day; and also, with the adjustment of a number of important\r\nchurch matters, which demanded my immediate attention. Without taking\r\ntime to read the letter, without realizing its importance, or its\r\nurgency; I mechanically placed it in my desk, thinking meanwhile, that\r\nwhen the time came in which I could pen a reply, I would then confer\r\nwith mother for further instructions. Unfortunately, the letter became\r\nmisplaced and all memory of its existence, passed out of my mind!\r\n\r\n\"One month ago, while busily engaged in assorting and rearranging a\r\nconfusing mass of papers, I found the lost letter. After reading it\r\ncarefully, I became conscience-smitten, as I thought what serious\r\nresults might have followed my criminal negligence. I then commenced a\r\nsearch for this young lady, which has finally lead me to Solaris. I have\r\ntraced her here, as a member of your colony. Her name is Honora Eloise\r\nHoughton. Do you know her, Fillmore! Is she here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Make yourself perfectly easy, friend Gaylord! She is here! She is all\r\nright! Miss Houghton does not need your protecting care, or the\r\nprotecting care of anyone. She is abundantly able to take good care of\r\nherself and of plenty of other people besides! She can dissipate your\r\ntroubles in a jiffy! She can give you something to think of, which will\r\nnot fail to hold your close attention. She can soon find a work for you,\r\nin which you will be interested in spite of yourself! In fact George,\r\nHonora Eloise Houghton, is one of the brightest, most independent,\r\ncapable, self-poised, self-supporting young women at Solaris! If she\r\nshould kindly consent to take you under the brooding care of her\r\nprotecting wing, in one month's time you would not know yourself, you\r\nwould be transformed into a new man! But, Miss Houghton is a very busy\r\nwoman. One of the most useful on the farm! Just at present, she is the\r\nleading director of the nursery and kindergarten school; the principal\r\nfemale teacher, in the gymnasium; the president of the dancing club; the\r\nsecretary and treasurer of the physiology club; and vice-president of\r\nthe botany, chemistry and history clubs. After faithfully performing the\r\nduties belonging to these offices, she still finds time to do a great\r\namount of scientific research and reading; so much, that last year, she\r\neasily carried off the prize, which was awarded to the best qualified,\r\nscientific student among the young ladies at Solaris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, Fillmore! You grieve and astonish me! You surely must be jesting,\r\nin dishing up this long rigmarole, about Miss Houghton's\r\naccomplishments! After what I have told you, I cannot conceive how you\r\ncan fail to understand, that I am not in a mood for jesting. As for the\r\ngirl, I very much desire to meet her, that I may have an opportunity to\r\nexpress the regrets and apologies for my unfortunate neglect of her\r\nmother's letter, to which she is so justly entitled. This painful duty\r\nonce performed, my interest in Miss Houghton will cease.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, George, I am not jesting! I am very much in earnest! I\r\nthink I understand your case thoroughly. I know that you do not realize\r\nthe seriousness of that paralyzing, apathetic condition, into which you\r\nhave fallen. I do not think you need condolence, or any form of mild\r\nsympathetic treatment. I am sure you do need very much, to be aroused by\r\nnew associations, scenes, friends and acquaintances; strong magnetic\r\npeople, with ideas so radical, so startling, that by one quick wrench,\r\nyour line of thought may be diverted into some entirely new channel. If\r\ntherefore, in my talk to you about Miss Houghton, I have succeeded in\r\narousing your indignation, in the slightest degree, I shall be\r\nencouraged by knowing that my efforts for your good, have been made in\r\nthe right direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Fillmore! I fear I have been hasty! And, that I have\r\nentirely misjudged your motive! I am now in a much better frame of mind,\r\nto listen attentively to what you have to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds much more reasonable, George. I will now return to my\r\ndescription of Miss Houghton, which was broken off by your interruption.\r\nFor the reasons I have just stated, I believe that Miss Houghton, is the\r\none individual in a thousand, whose acquaintance just at present, would\r\nprove most beneficial for you. Of course you have not seen her, you do\r\nnot know her; therefore, you cannot appreciate the peculiar charm of her\r\nmagnetic presence, or the force and dignity of her attractive character.\r\nFor this reason, a personal description, will fail to give you an\r\nadequate idea of the noble type of womanhood which she represents.\r\n\r\n\"However, George, after these preliminary remarks, I hasten to assure\r\nyou, that as a woman, Honora Eloise Houghton, is a goodly person to\r\nbehold. One inch less than six feet in height, straight as an arrow,\r\nbroad of shoulder, and round of limb, swift of hand and foot, lithe and\r\nwillowy in every motion, her commanding figure possesses the grace and\r\nbeauty, of a Venus and a Diana combined. Her large, full, well turned\r\nneck and throat, fittingly supports a symmetrical, well poised head, of\r\nthe same noble proportions. A long, thick, luxuriant growth of golden\r\nhair, brilliant with changing hues of a coppery tinge, seemingly so\r\nsurcharged with electro-magnetic force, as to form a halo of sunshine\r\naround both face and head, is her chief personal adornment. Her large,\r\noval face, well formed mouth, strong white teeth, firm chin, finely\r\narched, strongly defined brows, broad, smooth forehead, and straight\r\ngrecian nose; all denote a character of marked type and unusual force.\r\nFull, clear, gray eyes, set well apart, beautifully and mirthfully\r\nexpressive, together, with a bright, ruddy complexion, are both\r\nindicative of Miss Houghton's perfect health and strong, vital,\r\nnervous-sanguine temperament. With this temperament and such a\r\nmagnificent physique, reinforced by wonderful psychic powers, she is an\r\nideal healing medium. The very personification of health! Such is the\r\npotency of her magnetic force, that among the people of Solaris, cures\r\nperformed by the simple process of laying on of hands, have made her the\r\nmarvel of the village; they have won for her the confidence, respect,\r\nadmiration and love, of every member of the colony; man, woman or child.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, George, I may say with pride, that Miss Houghton\r\nrepresents one of the noblest of women, which may be discovered, evolved\r\nor grown by the co-operative farm. As an exponent of what the movement\r\ncan do for woman, she is a shining example, of which our people may well\r\nbe proud!\r\n\r\n\"Try to be patient with me, George! I have described this young lady, at\r\nsuch length, in order that you may meet her without prejudice. We will\r\nnow go in search of Miss Houghton, for an interview. After introducing\r\nyou, I will return here. When the interview is at an end, I will have my\r\nlight, road mobile ready, and we will take a spin around the farm.\r\nAfterwards, if there should be time, we will take a run over to Fenwick,\r\nten miles away.\"\r\n\r\n\"That arrangement will suit me very well, Fillmore! I am now quite\r\ncurious to meet Miss Houghton. After my interview with her is concluded,\r\nI shall be delighted to accompany you on a mobile excursion over the\r\nfarm. I have in mind a host of questions, which I wish to ask; after my\r\ntour of inspection, I am sure I can frame them more intelligently.\"\r\n\r\nFour days later, we find George Gaylord, again seated in the office with\r\nFillmore Flagg. They are speaking of things which have transpired,\r\nduring the interval named.\r\n\r\n\"You are looking decidedly better, to-day, George! I congratulate you!\r\nAfter the fright you gave me, while at the club dance, that evening\r\nafter your arrival at Solaris, I thought you were ticketed for a long,\r\nserious illness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Fillmore, I have Miss Houghton to thank for being able to again\r\nwalk and talk with some degree of steadiness! She is truly, the most\r\nmarvelous woman, that I have ever met! There seems to be a healing power\r\nin the very touch of her garments! I feel quite sure, that she has\r\nsaved my life. I ought to apologize to the members of the dancing club,\r\nfor the very awkward sensation, which must have followed my unfortunate\r\ncollapse; that sudden attack of giddiness and loss of consciousness.\r\nMiss Houghton tells me, that the attack lasted over an hour, after I had\r\nbeen placed on a cot in the hospital. Were you there, Fillmore?\"\r\n\r\n\"What a question, George! Of course I was there! That one hour, seemed\r\nthree to me. Knowing something of your critical condition, I was blaming\r\nmyself, for having foolishly attempted to crowd so much into your first\r\nday's experience at Solaris. However, Miss Houghton assured me, that I\r\nneed not be alarmed over the trance-like condition, into which you had\r\nfallen. She seemed to understand your case from the first, and declared\r\nthat she could cure you with a few days' treatment. She further stated\r\nfor my benefit, that I was in no wise responsible for the attack of\r\nvertigo, which in your condition, was liable to occur at any time.\r\n\r\n\"So far as the dancing club people are concerned, no apologies on your\r\npart are needed. They understand the circumstances, and wish me to\r\nassure you, that they will rejoice with you over your speedy recovery.\r\nIt seems, George, that your physician prescribes plenty of fresh air and\r\nsunshine for you, during the next few days. Do you think you are strong\r\nenough to-day, for another mobile excursion over the farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes Fillmore, quite strong enough, provided the excursion is not too\r\nlong. To-morrow, if the weather should be fine, I hope we may be able to\r\ntake that trip to Fenwick, which you spoke of on the afternoon of my\r\narrival. The more I see of the farm, the more I am interested and\r\ndelighted. In a very short time, I believe I might become an enthusiast\r\non the agricultural question. Hitherto, I have had an unexpressed\r\nantipathy, towards farm work.\r\n\r\n\"Strongly impressed with the idea, that a farm life must necessarily, be\r\nas dull as ditch water; I find Solaris a revelation, which has opened my\r\neyes and scattered my foolish prejudices to the four winds. At every\r\nturn, some new surprise awaits me. My typical farmer, with his shock of\r\nuntrimmed hair and beard, his stooping shoulders, his shambling,\r\nplow-following gait, his great cow-hide boots, his coarse, soiled,\r\nslouchy, ill-fitting blouse and overalls, his grimy hands, his\r\nill-at-ease, uncultured manners, and his born-tired expression of\r\ncountenance, I cannot find. In his place, much to my astonishment, I do\r\nfind a splendid people, in the prime of life, lithe, active and\r\nenergetic, in the possession of a superabundance of vitality, which\r\ngives them the graceful air of having grown to a perfect maturity, on\r\nthe sunny side of life. What does it mean? Everywhere, I am politely\r\ngreeted, by dignified, graceful, self-poised, rosy-cheeked, bright-eyed,\r\nhappy, well-dressed, educated, refined and polished men and women. Can\r\nit be possible, that they are farm laborers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one, friend Gaylord! It is to rightly organized farm labor,\r\nproperly supplemented by appropriate machinery, that these people owe\r\nthe superior condition in which you find them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have surely created a new era in farming, Fillmore! Do you think a\r\ngeneral introduction of co-operative farming, will produce equally\r\nsuccessful results elsewhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much better and more satisfactory, George! Co-operative farming, even\r\nhere at Solaris, has as yet scarcely passed the threshold of the\r\nexperimental stage. Every new farm, will profit by the errors and\r\nsuccesses of those previously established. Each one will add to the\r\nstrength and working capacity of the mass. This improvement will\r\nsteadily increase, until the children born under the new system, become\r\nits principal working factors. When that time arrives, the influence of\r\nthe born and bred agriculturalists, will have grown so strong, socially\r\nand politically, that a new impetus will be given to the movement, by\r\nthe favorable legislation which they can then command.\r\n\r\n\"When we consider the future of the co-operative farm, as a working\r\nfactor for good, in the affairs of the Republic; we can then appreciate\r\nthe great importance of the movement. Stirpiculture, wedded to\r\nagriculture, ushers in a new era for the birth and education of an\r\nepoch-making race of dominant thinkers, so well born, so self-poised, so\r\nharmoniously developed, physically, intellectually, and spiritually,\r\nthat without effort, they are naturally chosen by the masses, as social\r\nand political leaders.\"\r\n\r\n\"What an enthusiastic dreamer you are, Fillmore! The picture of the\r\nfuture of the movement, which you have so graphically drawn, seems too\r\ngood to be true! My brain is in a whirl trying to follow you! Let us now\r\nprepare for that promised ride.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE COMING ERA OF GOOD ROADS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Since our mobile excursion to the farm village of Fenwick, I have been\r\nhaunted by the beauty, smoothness, utility and durability, of the\r\nmagnificent highway, which now connects the two villages. I am more than\r\never impressed with the power of the co-operative movement, to effect a\r\nrevolution in all industrial methods; especially, in travel and the\r\ntransportation of farm products. Tell me, Fillmore! Do you think this\r\nroad-building fever, will continue to spread with the growth of the\r\nmovement?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, George, with every new road, will come an added impetus to the\r\nmovement, which will insure a steady progress. The importance of good\r\nroads as a source of wealth, and a mark of civilization, is just\r\nbeginning to be understood by agricultural people, and by rural\r\npopulations generally. Oppressed on every hand by the universal\r\nextortion of railroad monopoly, they are slowly awakening to a\r\nrealization of the fact, that the question of cheap transportation, is\r\nfor them, the one, overshadowing question, which demands immediate\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\"As an object lesson on the subject of good roads, the introduction, and\r\nconstantly increasing use, of bicycles, motor cycles, motor freight\r\nwagons, automobiles, electro mobiles, locomobiles, and the entire class\r\nof vehicles equipped with rubber tires, has aroused a widespread\r\ninterest, which is prophetic of great results. Acting as a strong\r\nreinforcement to this educational work, the co-operative farm, with the\r\nadvantage of its village organization, representing in the public mind,\r\nsuch an attractive combination of agricultural, industrial and social\r\nlife; will by the force of example, give an additional impetus to the\r\nsystematic construction of broad, permanent highways; that shall prove a\r\nsource of pride, to the community through which they pass; roads, that\r\nshall last for centuries.\r\n\r\n\"Reacting favorably, in broadening the mission of the co-operative\r\nfarm-village, with its promise of permanent homes, and employment for\r\nthe unemployed, and the homeless; the continuous construction of these\r\nfree avenues of travel and transportation, will soon affect the status\r\nof all rural populations, by vastly increasing their wealth and power.\r\nFor them, the vexed problem of transportation, will be solved. They will\r\ndiscover by actual experience, that these wide, durable wagon roads,\r\nwill connect them with distant centers of traffic, and serve them better\r\nand more honestly, than steam railroads; that in cost of construction\r\nand repair, they are much cheaper; that when constructed, they belong to\r\nthe people as absolutely, free highways; that no greedy corporation, can\r\ncontrol them; that no threatening, irritating, lawless force, of\r\nPinkerton's armed thugs, is required to protect them; and finally, that\r\nthey offer every inducement to unfettered genius, to invent and to\r\nfreely exploit, better and cheaper vehicles.\r\n\r\n\"As one grand result of this combined educational work, rural life will\r\nbecome exceedingly desirable and charming. The great city, will lose its\r\nattractive force. The tide of migration, will flow back to the pure air,\r\ninvigorating sunshine, blue sky, and the verdure-clad hills of the\r\ncountry. In a general way, we may predict, that a few years hence,\r\neverywhere throughout this broad land, we shall find picturesque,\r\nprosperous, well populated villages. As the minor centers of education,\r\nart-culture, refinement, amusement, progressive race-culture, scientific\r\nagriculture, esthetic, social and co-operative life; they will be\r\nembroidered, like a vast net-work of shining pearls, on a perfect system\r\nof broad, smooth, highways. In their construction, ornamentation and\r\nmaintenance, these good roads will utilize and express, the pride,\r\nenergy and best inventive genius, of the village centers thus linked\r\ntogether. As a result, the Republic will be gridironed with a superb\r\nsystem of free highways, more permanent, more perfect, and more\r\nbeautiful, than those old, historic, Roman roads, which even now are\r\nexisting monuments to the solid character of Roman civilization.\r\n\r\n\"This imperial road system will be complete, when the co-operative farm\r\nhas reached every township in the union. Then, we may calculate the\r\nresults, which are to follow. Broad, tree-shaded, park-lined,\r\nflower-bordered boulevards, will connect New York with San Francisco;\r\nGalveston with Saint Paul; Portland, Maine, with Portland, Oregon; Los\r\nAngeles with Saint Louis; Boston with Buffalo, Philadelphia, and\r\nBaltimore with Jacksonville, Florida; New Orleans with Cincinnati and\r\nChicago; the wonders of Yellowstone Park, with the crags and glens of\r\nthe White Mountains, Niagara Falls, with the Grand Canon of the\r\nColorado; the orange groves of Florida and California, with the\r\npicturesque, cool, invigorating, health resorts of Lake Superior; the\r\nwheat fields of the great Northwest, with the coal mines of\r\nPennsylvania; Washington, the nation's capital, with every seaside\r\nresort, every mountain view, every beautiful city, every healing\r\nspring, and every hamlet and village of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\"Pulsing with a new tide of social and industrial life, flowing through\r\nthe arteries of this unequaled system of great highways; all of these\r\nplaces, both great and small, will become more closely bound together,\r\nby the links of a new social order; representing the beginning of a\r\nhigher civilization. Then, these beautiful highways, will be glorified\r\nand appreciated by mankind, as the monumental work of one, broad system,\r\nof co-operative farm villages. Then, these villages, which have made\r\nsuch a system possible, may collectively claim the proud distinction, of\r\nbeing known as the Nation's Committee on Good Roads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent! Most excellent! Fillmore. Your prophetic vision, with the\r\nvastness and the brilliancy of its sweeping scope, fairly takes my\r\nbreath! Yet, I must confess, that judging from the masterly system of\r\nroad-building inaugurated by Solaris and Fenwick, the evolutionary\r\nresults which you so confidently predict, are both reasonable and\r\nlogical. What additional results, do you claim for the system?\"\r\n\r\n\"At this time, George, neither tongue nor pen, may attempt to describe\r\nthe marvelous results which will follow the introduction of an era of\r\ngood roads. In a brief way, I will try to give a few of the most\r\nimportant. In the matter of travel and transportation, these free\r\nhighways, will annually, save millions of dollars to citizens of the\r\nRepublic, by enabling them to escape from the clutches of the largest\r\nand most powerful of all monopolies; the railway monopoly. A monopoly,\r\nthat for many years, has held the public by the throat; exacting a\r\ntariff so exorbitant, as to be almost prohibitory. A monopoly, which\r\nhas had the amazing gall to pose as the farmer's especial benefactor. A\r\nmonopoly, that while so posing, has robbed the country of one-half its\r\nwealth, by transferring the same to cities. A monopoly, that in the name\r\nof good business, has had the stupidity to decree through its tariff\r\nschedule, that miles and miles of empty freight cars, shall daily,\r\nthroughout the land, roll past hundreds of thousands of farms, where\r\ncountless tons of heavy freight, in the way of fresh vegetables, lie\r\nrotting for the want of a market. A monopoly, that never neglects an\r\nopportunity for fleecing the public. A monopoly, so unscrupulous, that\r\nfor the pork trust, it will haul a hog across the continent for ninety\r\ncents; while for indifferent service, it dares to charge the people,\r\nfrom two and one-half, to five cents per mile.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, George, just think of it! In the beginning, this monopoly was\r\nchartered to serve the people who granted the franchise. A monopoly, now\r\ngrown so bold, that when the public protests that the franchise is\r\nviolated, because the interests of the people are no longer served; a\r\nVanderbilt railroad king, insolently replies: 'The public be damned!' A\r\nmonopoly that has killed all healthy competition, by organizing all\r\nrailroads into one giant pool; thereby creating the mother of trusts,\r\ncontrolling a corruption fund of enormous magnitude. A monopolistic\r\ntrust, grown so rich and powerful, as to be beyond the reach of law;\r\nboldly corrupting courts, buying legislators, and turning the\r\nadministration of justice into a farce. In fact, this monstrous combine,\r\nhas become so dangerous to every interest of good government, that the\r\nlaw of self-preservation demands that it shall be speedily wiped out, by\r\nthe government ownership of all railroads.\r\n\r\n\"We may now consider the ways and means, by which our co-operative\r\nsystem of good roads, can control railroad freights, and finally drive\r\nrailroads to government ownership. Long before the close of the first\r\nhalf of the twentieth century, thousands of miles of these fine wagon\r\nroads, will be found in every State. Responding to the demands of\r\nlegions of voters, who reside in the co-operative farm villages\r\nbordering these charming highways; a strong force of legislators, will\r\neverywhere rise up, as eloquent advocates of the good roads movement.\r\nHonest and faithful, inspired by a tenacity of purpose which will brook\r\nno opposition from railroad lobbies; encouraged and strengthened, by an\r\never increasing army of enthusiastic voters behind them, these tireless\r\nlegislators will not halt, until the entire system of good roads, so\r\nwell begun by the farm villages, shall be taken up, completed, and\r\nperfected by the State. Ten years of such forceful work, will surely\r\naccomplish the task.\r\n\r\n\"Then, to the champions of the system, shall come their reward. They\r\nshall behold, flowing in mighty streams, over the wide, petroleum\r\ntreated, dustless surfaces, of these far-reaching, absolutely free\r\nhighways, the traffic and travel of a mighty Republic!\r\n\r\n\"Then, will come the demonstration of what American genius can do,\r\ntoward the evolution of a superior class of rubber tired, horseless\r\nvehicles, which shall prove the best, cheapest and most durable, for\r\npurposes of freight, traffic, and travel, on such a complete system of\r\nfine roads. The best of our present types, when compared with these\r\ntwentieth century road flyers and freight rollers, will seem poor, crude\r\naffairs. The irresistible volume of this swift stream of the new\r\ntravel, and the new transportation, eloquent with the progress of the\r\ncentury, will herald the coming of a well-merited doom for the\r\nmonopolistic railroad combines.\r\n\r\n\"Then, local travel and traffic, will make haste to desert the iron\r\nrails. Railroad freights everywhere, will fall to zero. Short\r\nrailroads--branches and feeders to main lines--will become useless and\r\nworthless. Many of them will be sold at auction, for less than the cost\r\nof the iron in the road-bed.\r\n\r\n\"Then, shorn of their ill-gotten gains, the mighty railroad kings of the\r\nland, will fall from their tall pedestals of pride, where for years,\r\nthey have posed as owners of the earth. With financial ruin staring them\r\nin the face, they, and the whole brood of erstwhile railroad kings, will\r\nmake urgent haste to sell to the government, at the bare cost of\r\nconstruction, such great through lines as may be necessary to maintain\r\ninter-state commerce, and across-the-continent traffic. Other roads,\r\nthey may not sell at any price. A government for the people, and by the\r\npeople, will have no further use for them.\r\n\r\n\"Then at last, the supreme folly of having a half-dozen competing lines,\r\nrunning side by side through the same territory, will be fully\r\ndemonstrated. With this demonstration, will come the opportunity, to\r\nscores of paid press writers, pessimistic bigots, self-conceited,\r\nunprogressive wiseacres, who have so long and so loudly derided the\r\ngovernment ownership of railroads, as the most suicidal and unbusiness\r\nlike scheme ever hatched; to answer this pertinent question: Would it be\r\npossible, for government engineers building public railroads, to ever be\r\nguilty of such monumental stupidity?\r\n\r\n\"The social effect of these good roads, on the lives of all\r\nagricultural people, will prove even more important than the financial\r\nadvantages gained. Hitherto, they have been so hampered by environments,\r\nby lack of means, and lack of leisure, that as a class they have been\r\nunable to enjoy or to appreciate the wonderful, the educational, the\r\nbroadening and the refining effect of much travel, on the mind of the\r\nindividual. From lack of experience, they do not realize that the sum of\r\nhuman life is the sum of its sensations, which are produced by change of\r\nenvironment, contact with a larger or lesser series of natural\r\nphenomena, and more especially with other lives.\r\n\r\n\"The more progressive lessons of life, are learned from example and not\r\nfrom precept. Men and women, are only children of a larger growth, they\r\nare imitative creatures with a natural instinct to choose other, higher,\r\nand better lives as models. Hence the great value of travel as an\r\neducator. The larger the area covered by the traveler, the wider the\r\nfield of experience and choice. Through the law of action and reaction,\r\nsocial contact with a multitude of actors and thinkers, refines the\r\nindividual. A healthy spirit of emulation is aroused, which leads on to\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\"With the advent of a universal system of good roads, cheap travel, and\r\na dominant combination of co-operative, industrial and agricultural\r\nenterprise, an extraordinary era of recreation and travel, will dawn for\r\nall rural people. Opportunity, leisure, and means will be abundant. All\r\nco-operative workers, can afford to take an annual vacation of at least\r\none month. The ownership of a swift, roomy, durable, road machine,\r\ncapable of making from twenty to thirty-five miles an hour, will be\r\nwithin the means of every family. In this private car, the family, or a\r\nselect party, could easily and leisurely accomplish a five thousand mile\r\ntour in twenty days. Along the whole distance, farm villages, from\r\nfifteen to twenty minutes apart, would offer the travelers, machine\r\nsupplies, repairs, and excellent hotel accommodations, for an expense\r\nnot in excess of the same at home. Than this, no traveling excursion\r\ncould be more delightful! For pure enjoyment, a select party of\r\nnineteenth century millionaires, could not equal it.\r\n\r\n\"The enjoyment of such delightful opportunities for even a single\r\ndecade, would make the rank and file of the republic thoroughly\r\nacquainted, with the soil, scenery, forests, lakes and rivers; the\r\nmining and manufacturing possibilities; the peculiar characteristics of\r\nthe people, their local ambitions, political wants and future demands,\r\nof every state and county in the union.\r\n\r\n\"Thus equipped with this important knowledge, each voter, both men and\r\nwomen alike, would be prepared at any time to vote intelligently and\r\nwisely, on every question affecting the welfare of the republic as a\r\nwhole, or in part. Elected to Congress, these voters would appear as the\r\nablest, most patriotic, most just, and most incorruptible body of\r\nlaw-makers ever known. Understanding the equities of righteous dealing\r\nbetween themselves as fellow citizens, they would be prepared to decide\r\ncorrectly on all questions of an international character, which might\r\naffect the interests of the world at large. This would be a\r\ndemonstration of the rule, as to the formation of a true republic. To\r\nmake the entire political fabric both enduring and progressive, the\r\nunits or voters, must be well born and rightly trained. Of this\r\ntraining, travel is an essential part, which should not, which must not\r\nbe overlooked.\r\n\r\n\"As affecting their social and intellectual progress, these years of\r\ntravel would improve all classes of agricultural and industrial people,\r\nto a still higher degree than the one achieved in political expression.\r\nA general interest would be aroused in questions of political economy,\r\nrace culture, psychology, and physiology; geology, geography and\r\nhistory, botany, chemistry, and mineralogy; which later, would lead to\r\nclose reading and hard study in the whole domain of scientific research,\r\nas the one sure method of increasing the scope of individual happiness.\r\nEvery succeeding year of this travel-training, would result in binding\r\nall classes still more firmly together, into one harmonious, homogeneous\r\nmass. Now George, tell me what you think of the good-roads question! Is\r\nit not one affecting the vital interests of humanity to a marvelous\r\nextent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marvelous, Fillmore! Most marvelous! Hereafter, you can count on me as\r\nan enthusiastic advocate. I cannot say too much in its favor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nCO-OPERATIVE ETHICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of wages,\" said George Gaylord, \"did I understand you to say,\r\nthat all of the co-operators at Solaris receive the same pay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, George, equal wages for all classes of workers, is the motto at\r\nSolaris. Recognizing the solidarity of the interests of society, simple\r\njustice demands the same rate of pay for each member of the company;\r\nwithout regard to sex, or particular qualification.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, Fillmore, that justice would demand that each one\r\nshould be paid according to skill and capacity. I cannot understand, how\r\nanyone capable of being a foreman, would be content to accept, as a just\r\nequivalent for his services, a compensation as low as that awarded to\r\nthe least capable worker in the colony.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I shall be able to convince you, George, that a correct view of\r\nthis question, is largely a matter of education. You have, perhaps\r\nunconsciously, voiced the usual argument against the equity of equality,\r\nwhich is made by the champions of the competitive system. Our people\r\nhave learned from experience, that the co-operative farm movement is a\r\nleveling up process, which purposes to raise the weaker units, to the\r\ncondition of the higher. They have learned, that society is a purely\r\nco-operative institution. They have learned, that the wants of society,\r\ncreate value for the products of labor. Society, then, is labor's\r\nmarket. In this market, the wants of the weaker units, are just as\r\nimportant, as are those of the stronger. Stimulated by the number and\r\nvariety of these wants, inventive genius has given to us tools and\r\nmachinery, which have increased, at least one hundred fold, the capacity\r\nof labor to produce. In the creation of tools and machinery, the mental\r\nacuteness and inventive skill of the weaker unit, often surpasses that\r\nof the stronger. It follows, then, that each one of the weaker units, is\r\njustly entitled to an equal share of the advantages which are conferred\r\non labor by society, with its market and equipment of tools and\r\nmachinery. These advantages, make the productive work of all classes,\r\nnearly equal. Let us try to find the real difference, between the daily\r\nlabor products of the strongest and the weakest workers. Let us consider\r\npresent conditions here at Solaris, as an illustration. Let us take one\r\nhundred dollars, as the value of the product of one day's labor, by an\r\naverage person, plus the advantage of such superior social organization,\r\ntraining, tools and equipment, as Solaris can now furnish. On the other\r\nhand, let us take fifty cents, as the value of one day's labor, by the\r\nstrongest, most capable worker, when isolated from his fellows, and from\r\nall social organization, with its tools and equipment. Under the\r\ncircumstances, allowing that the strongest could produce twice as much\r\nas the weakest, we should have twenty-five cents, as the value of the\r\ndaily product of the weakest worker. These sums, compared with one\r\nhundred dollars, would give us the exact difference between the\r\nstrongest and the weakest, under the favorable co-operative conditions,\r\nexisting at Solaris. A difference, so trifling as to be scarcely worthy\r\nof consideration, only one-fourth of one per cent. What think you,\r\nGeorge! Where now is the injustice of equal wages? Remember, when\r\njustice is done, the mission of charity is finished!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your clear statement of the case, has proved a revelation to me,\r\nFillmore! I am quite ready to acknowledge the exact justice, of your\r\nco-operative system of equal wages. I am profoundly impressed with the\r\nsoundness of your argument, that women and all weaker units in the army\r\nof labor, are justly entitled to an equal share of the advantages\r\nconferred on labor, by social organization, and by the education,\r\ntraining and equipment, resulting from that organization. This view of\r\nthe question, is a new one to me. It places the whole subject, in quite\r\na different light. By the aid of this light, I am beginning to\r\nunderstand something of the intricacy and force, of this co-operative\r\nmachine, which we call society; and how much it affects the question of\r\nlabor and wages.\r\n\r\n\"My experience with co-operative farming here at Solaris, is beginning\r\nto bear fruit. Under your instruction, friend Flagg, I think I can now\r\nunderstand the wide difference, between the competitive and the\r\nco-operative systems of organized labor. The former, benefits the few at\r\nthe expense of the many. The latter, raises the individual, by\r\nbenefiting the mass. The first, seems to be a constant menace, which\r\nthreatens the peace, welfare and stability of society; clearly making\r\nfor evil. The second, striving for the interests of all, builds up,\r\nstrengthens and purifies the weaker units; unmistakably making for good.\r\nThe results seem to marshal themselves on the side of co-operation, for\r\nthe purpose of demonstrating the truth of its shibboleth, that the\r\ninjury or weakness of one, is the concern of all. In other words, to\r\nraise the lower strata of society, means a corresponding elevation for\r\nthe upper. The average morality, happiness and prosperity of society, is\r\nmeasured by the morality, happiness and prosperity of its weaker units.\r\nTell me, Fillmore, does the acceptance and advocacy of this view of the\r\nrelations existing between labor and society, make one a socialist?\"\r\n\r\n\"They surely do, George! They make you a socialist of the most\r\nprogressive type. I am both surprised and delighted, to find how well\r\nyou have learned the lesson of co-operation.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the co-operators at Solaris, are socialists, then they must be good\r\npeople. I am perfectly willing to be classed with them. At all events, I\r\nam a thorough convert to the co-operative system. I can now understand\r\nthe scope and significance of the work; and why it is, that the Solaris\r\nworkers, are so much superior to any farm people I have ever known. I\r\nbegin to perceive that the success of the co-operative farm, means the\r\nregeneration of society.\r\n\r\n\"This morning, Fillmore, under the guidance of Miss Houghton, I visited\r\nthe kindergarten, the schools, the club rooms and the theatre. I was\r\namazed, to find such a magnificent system of education and amusement, in\r\nsuccessful operation, for the benefit of a farm village. Indeed! A city\r\nof fifty thousand people, would be very fortunate, in the possession of\r\nsuch a fine one! How did you manage to make it possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"In carrying out the wise plans of Fennimore Fenwick, you behold to-day,\r\nthe result of combined co-operative agriculture and stirpiculture, which\r\naffords to our people, and to their children, conditions for education\r\nand amusement, fully equal to anything, money can procure for the\r\nwealthy. Children born at Solaris, under carefully prepared conditions\r\nfor a perfect motherhood, are endowed with a precious birth-right, far\r\nsuperior to anything heretofore known to heirs of wealth. The system is\r\nbeing constantly improved. As it now stands, I consider it the crowning\r\nsuccess of the co-operative movement.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of Miss Houghton, George, reminds me of a question! You have\r\nyet to tell me, the result of your first interview with her. Did she\r\nseem to blame you so very much, for not answering her mother's letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! no! She was kindness personified. She hastened to assure me that,\r\nin the light of subsequent events, she came to understand the whole\r\nsituation. It appears, that after writing the letter in question, her\r\nmother grew very much better. In this improved state, she lingered for\r\nsome time, and did not die until several weeks after Miss Houghton had\r\nread to her, the notice of my mother's death, which came to them through\r\nthe columns of an occasional New England newspaper.\r\n\r\n\"Having answered your question, Fillmore, I will now return to the\r\nsubject of my visit to the schools. The interest manifested by both\r\nchildren and teachers is something to be proud of. The amount of general\r\ninformation of a practical character, which the pupils have acquired,\r\neven in the lower classes, is quite surprising. This is especially\r\nnoticeable, in the ready knowledge they display, regarding current\r\npolitical events; including the personal history, character and ability,\r\nof the various political leaders. Is it wise, to devote so much time to\r\nteaching politics; and to commence this teaching with children so young?\r\nDo you really consider it so very important?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, George, it is a matter of the utmost importance! A republic of\r\nignorant people, is a republic only in name; in reality, it is an\r\noligarchy. On the contrary, a true republic, is one in which all its\r\nunits or voters, are so educated, that they are familiar with the theory\r\nand practice of government. They must know that true government is a\r\nco-operative institution, which must guard and protect with exact\r\njustice, the interests of all of the governed. They must know, the\r\nextent and condition of the agricultural, manufacturing, commercial,\r\nmineral and lumbering resources of the country. They should understand\r\ndiplomatic, domestic and foreign relations. They should know every\r\ndetail, of the educational, financial and political wants of the masses,\r\nin the domain of each State or Territory. Finally, they must be familiar\r\nwith the character, trustworthiness and ability, of all political\r\nleaders. Children of the co-operative farm, are educated and trained, in\r\na manner that will best fit them to become true citizens of such a\r\nrepublic. This is why, a practical, political education, to be\r\nsuccessful, must become a matter of interest to the children while they\r\nare young. They will then learn, that a true republic, is a co-operative\r\nmachine, which cannot run smoothly, while one imperfect cog remains to\r\nretard the action of its wheels. This valuable lesson, they cannot learn\r\ntoo soon. What think you, friend Gaylord?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot quite agree with you in this matter, Fillmore! I think it\r\nwould be far wiser, while they are so young, to teach these children\r\nsuch lessons as will give them the ground work for a sound religious\r\nfaith. Then they will understand the first importance, of being prepared\r\nto save their own souls. Later, in the closing school years, they could\r\nbe taught your progressive, political scheme, which I think is a\r\nremarkably good one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop one moment, George! I see Miss Houghton is coming. She will be\r\ndelighted with an opportunity to answer some of your objections, to the\r\nco-operative code of ethics, evolved by the people of Solaris.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a welcome visitor, Miss Houghton! You have arrived, just in the\r\nnick of time! Our mutual friend here, Mr. Gaylord, has been telling me\r\nof his visit to our schools, under your guidance. While he praises the\r\nwonderful progress made by the pupils; he seems to think, that we teach\r\ntoo much politics and too little religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Miss Houghton!\" said George Gaylord, \"I assure you, that I\r\nwas not indulging the spirit of fault finding! Allow me to explain! I\r\nhad reached a point in our discussion, where I was about to remark, that\r\nsince Adam's time, the people of the world have been born, heirs to the\r\ndominancy of total depravity. With this heritage, we are as prone to\r\nsin, as are the sparks to fly upward. Under such circumstances, it would\r\nsurely be the height of folly, to attempt to overcome this natural\r\ntendency toward evil, without the aid of the strong arm of the church,\r\nwith its broad mantle of christian faith and saving grace.\"\r\n\r\n\"I grant you, Mr. Gaylord, that with your peculiar training, such a\r\nconclusion would be quite natural.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Flagg! I have a word for you! We must make every allowance,\r\nfor Mr. Gaylord's theological education. An education, that has filled\r\nhis mind with somewhat distorted meanings, for the terms, religious\r\nfaith, soul, sin, salvation, religion, total depravity and many others\r\nof a similar import, which theology has applied to man's spiritual\r\nwelfare. Just at present, the difference between us, is wholly a matter\r\nof definition. When we have acquired a true meaning for these disputed\r\nterms, we shall stand harmoniously on a common ground. We shall then be\r\nready to accept the higher teachings of the new religion. A religion of\r\nspiritual evolution and unfoldment, which responds to the progress of\r\nthe twentieth century.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite right, Miss Houghton! I am very willing to make the\r\ngenerous allowance you suggest. I think Mr. Gaylord would be glad to\r\nhear your views, regarding the practical teachings of the new religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Fillmore!\" said George Gaylord, \"you have voiced a request,\r\nI was about to make. I trust Miss Houghton, will proceed at once. I will\r\npromise to be a listener, who is both interested and attentive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will promise one thing, Mr. Gaylord. It is this, before I have\r\nfinished, I shall do my best, to convince you, that in embracing the new\r\nreligion, the people of Solaris have devoted themselves to a system of\r\nreligious teaching, which is far too broad for the limitation of church\r\nwalls. That this new religion, is so practical, and so exacting, that\r\nits followers, if they are true, are in duty bound to observe it as a\r\nrule of life, seven days in the week, year in and year out.\r\n\r\n\"As a primary basis, the new religion teaches, that all human life is\r\nsacred. That it is the highest expression on this planet, of an\r\nOmniscient purpose. Conscious life, or the capacity to become conscious\r\nof anything, is a Deific attribute. All knowledge comes to the mind\r\nthrough the avenue of the senses, or from sensations produced by contact\r\nwith existing things in the domain of Nature. The domain of Nature, is\r\nthe domain of the Omniscient! All real knowledge, acquired from this\r\ndomain by right methods, which is in harmony with natural evolution, is\r\nTruth. Truth, then, is Divine!\r\n\r\n\"From these broad premises, we may deduce, that to acquire knowledge, or\r\nto accumulate truth, becomes the highest duty of life, a religious\r\nactivity of the highest order. To be engaged in the intellectual\r\nprocess of gaining knowledge, is to be engaged in a spiritual work. The\r\nintellectual process, is a spiritual process. By the psychologic action\r\nof the mind, through its sub-conscious functioning, all knowledge coming\r\nthrough the senses, first becomes the spiritual possession of the Ego,\r\nthe Soul, the seat of consciousness, before it can be expressed\r\nmaterially by the mortal man. Hence, spiritual evolution, is a natural\r\ngrowth, a crowning part of physical and intellectual evolution. The\r\nbody, as an associated colony of more or less intelligent cells, is an\r\nimportant part of the thinking machine. Body, brain and intellect, in\r\ntheir dual existence on the material plane, form an important trinity,\r\nwhich enables the Spirit to accumulate knowledge, and also to retain\r\nthat knowledge, after the passing of the physical. To dispute this\r\npostulate, would be manifestly absurd, as the spiritual man is the\r\nconscious Ego, the real gleaner and possessor of knowledge. It follows\r\nthen, that to be engaged in any kind of educational work, is to be\r\nengaged in a religious work of great spiritual importance. That, through\r\nproper intellectual training, we may obtain spiritual growth, rebuild\r\nthe moral character, exterminate vice, and unfold the graces of virtue,\r\npurity, honesty and goodness. These are spiritual attributes, which\r\nembrace all there is in the domain of morals.\r\n\r\n\"In appealing to the new religion, for a broader, truer definition of\r\nthe term, Soul, we learn that Soul, as a cosmic unit of the larger\r\ncosmos, is the repository of infinite possibilities: That evolution is\r\nthe law, by which these possibilities are unfolded: That it inherits\r\nimmortality as a birthright, from the Great Over Soul, the source and\r\ncenter of all life: That, in fulfilling the law of life, by sojourning\r\nin the flesh for a brief period, it cannot be lost, or become totally\r\ndepraved; although the body, which is but its earthly expression, may\r\nbecome so debased by poverty, selfishness and sin, as to momentarily\r\nthwart the Divine purpose of life.\r\n\r\n\"From the same source, and by the same authority, in response to a\r\nsincere desire for a better definition of the word Sin; we are taught,\r\nthat the object and purpose of the existence of this planet, is the\r\nevolution and perfection of the human race. Human life, then, is the\r\nflower and fruit of the planet. As such, it is the direct expression of\r\na Divine purpose. At the command of a higher law, this life must at all\r\ntimes, be treated as sacred. From this high rock of observation, we\r\nperceive that all acts, by society or individuals, which tend to\r\npromote, protect and purify this life, are helpful along lines of\r\nevolution; therefore, righteous and good. In their doing, these acts\r\nbecome the highest expression of a religious duty. On the contrary, all\r\nacts, by society or individuals, which tend to destroy, injure, poison\r\nor sully this sacred life, or to bar its ordained progress, are in\r\nthemselves, unholy, wrong and criminal. In commission, these acts become\r\nthe greatest of all sins. The logic of this deduction, is beyond\r\ndispute; because they are direct attempts to thwart the progressive and\r\nevolutionary purpose of the planet; therefore, they must be considered\r\nas sins of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\n\"Second in magnitude, and akin to these in wickedness, is the sin of\r\nsociety against women. A sin so potent for evil, that at the behest of\r\nselfishness, greed and lust, government, church and society, with one\r\naccord and without a protest, join in denying to woman an existence of\r\nfinancial independence. This denial makes slaves of women, who should\r\nbe noble, pure, self-poised, self-sustaining and absolutely free. But\r\nthe acme of wickedness is reached, when this denial reduces women to\r\ncreatures of merchandise, when every year, it drives unnumbered\r\nthousands of them to lives of degredation and shame; thus perpetrating\r\nthe crime of the century against unborn generations, by tainting and\r\npoisoning the fountain of life at its very source. The new religion has\r\ndecreed, that the mothers of a perfected republic, must of a necessity,\r\nbe both pure and free. It purposes to cure this crime, by working\r\nthrough the strong arms of an ever-increasing series, of unselfish\r\nco-operative brotherhoods, where a progressive union of agriculture, and\r\nstirpiculture, shall provide for and protect both mothers and children;\r\nat the same time furnishing the ways and means, which offer an\r\nhonorable, useful self-sustaining existence to all woman kind, be they\r\nwives, mothers, sisters or sweethearts.\r\n\r\n\"Third in magnitude and closely allied to the first two, is the great\r\nsin of ignorance. The mother of bigotry and superstitious fear; the\r\nfather of duplicity and craven cowardice! What we know, we fear not. It\r\nis only the mysterious darkness of the unknown, that is filled with\r\nterror. To abolish ignorance, is to make the mind master over matter.\r\nMind is both the spiritual and the intellectual expression of the soul.\r\nTrue culture of the mind, is moral culture. It is only the well grown,\r\nhighly cultured mind, that can reflect the inherent graces of the\r\nspirit, which mark all noble characters. To the individual, who has\r\nacquired a knowledge of the law of evolution and environment, is given\r\nthe power to control environmental conditions; by wresting from nature\r\nthe secrets of success, in feeding, clothing, housing, educating and\r\nelevating humanity. It follows then, that to overcome the sin of\r\nignorance, is to banish poverty. To banish poverty, is to banish want.\r\nTo banish want, is to take away the very foundations of the sin of\r\nselfishness. Selfishness, is the father of a multitude of sins, which\r\nmust perish with it.\r\n\r\n\"From these premises we must deduce, that all educative work in the\r\nproper sense, is a religious activity, which makes us better acquainted\r\nwith the relations which exist, between man and his Creator, the Great\r\nOver Soul. The spiritualizing influence of this intellectual work,\r\ncarries with it the compensation of a great reward. It crowns the\r\ngleaner, with happiness of the purest type. As knowledge increases, the\r\nfield of knowledge expands, the flood of happiness swells in volume. A\r\nlong busy life on the material plane of existence, is far too short to\r\nacquire this vast treasure, which is commensurate with the needs of\r\nprogress for an eternity of spiritual existence, to which, this life is\r\nsimply the primary school. With a better understanding of the nature of\r\nsin, and of the alarming extent of its evil influence over human life;\r\nthe new religion undertakes to bless mankind, by banishing ignorance,\r\npoverty and crime. To this practical, spiritual work, the people of\r\nSolaris religiously devote themselves, as being a life-work of the\r\nnoblest order.\r\n\r\n\"The three principal sins which we have considered, may be justly\r\nregarded as the parents of all lesser sins. Having given a few brief\r\nsuggestions as to methods of cure, which are offered by the new\r\nreligion; I am now ready, Mr. Gaylord, to take up the doctrine of total\r\ndepravity; which plays such an important part in your theology.\r\n\r\n\"As the primary step, I will re-state a prior postulate, as follows:\r\nThe spiritual man, is the conscious Ego, the Soul, or a cosmic unit of\r\nthe larger cosmos; an indestructible part of the great life principle.\r\nAs such, it is the repository of infinite possibilities, which are\r\ndestined to be unfolded by the law of progressive evolution. From the\r\nGreat Over Soul, it inherits immortality and indestructibility;\r\ntherefore, it cannot be lost, saved, or become depraved. The mortal body\r\nis an outer covering, through which it must express itself on the\r\nmaterial plane of existence. Physical, intellectual and spiritual life,\r\nare subject to the law of evolution, by which they achieve progression\r\nand fulfill the purpose of existence.\r\n\r\n\"To assume, that the people of this planet, are born subject to the\r\ndominancy of total depravity, is to deny immortality, and the truth of\r\nthese postulates. In denying them, it denies the existence of a dominant\r\nprinciple of good, and affirms the existence of a dominant principle of\r\nevil. It also denies all progress, all moral reform, every noble\r\naspiration, every good deed, all evolution, all science and all reason.\r\nWhere then, in the economy of nature, is there room or use for the\r\ndoctrine of total depravity? A doctrine so pernicious, that in the\r\nmouths of its advocates, it has done more than aught else, to destroy\r\nthe confidence of mortals, in the wisdom and justice of the Divine plan\r\nof the universe. To even assert its existence, is to question the\r\nexistence of a universe, under the reign of justice, law and order.\r\nEvidently, the doctrine of total depravity, does not belong to the\r\ndomain of fact. It is equally clear, that it must be a theological\r\nfiction. A sin of theology against progress, which in the dazzling\r\nwhiteness of the spiritual light of the new religion, must soon fade\r\ninto oblivion.\r\n\r\n\"Can we teach politics to school children, as a part of our religious\r\nduties? Is a question we will now consider. The answer, will depend\r\nlargely on the definition, which we give to the word religion. Let us\r\ntry to find a true definition, broad enough to embrace an affirmative\r\nanswer to our question. As a basis, we have human life as the highest\r\nexpression of the planet. With the physical body, as the basis for\r\nintellectual evolution. With intellectual evolution, as the basis for\r\nspiritual evolution. Hence, we have as a conclusion, that the spiritual\r\ndevelopment and unfoldment of the race, up to a point where it can\r\naccept the truth of immortality, is the logical purpose to be\r\naccomplished by all religions. Reasoning from these premises, it would\r\nseem clear, that the practical value of any religion, must be measured\r\nby its ability to teach the people how to help themselves; how to master\r\nthe great problem of physical life, by attaining perfection in the arts\r\nof feeding, clothing, housing, educating and spiritualizing the race.\r\nIf, in connection with these solid foundations for a natural religion,\r\nwe add the important fact, that this is a republic, in which the wish of\r\nthe majority, should become the law of the mass; we shall discover that\r\npolitics become the natural channel, through which the wishes of the\r\nmajority are expressed; that corrupt politics, result in bad government;\r\nthat pure politics, insure good government; that a wise, just\r\ngovernment, is the greatest political benefit which can be conferred on\r\nthe people governed. United, these conclusions give an affirmative\r\nanswer to our question. They also tell us why, the new religion, the\r\nmouth-piece of inspiration, reason, science, evolution and progress,\r\nshould proclaim it a religious duty, to teach our children,--embryo\r\ncitizens of the republic--every practical detail of pure politics.\r\n\r\n\"What think you, Mr. Gaylord? Have your objections, been satisfactorily\r\nanswered? Can we agree to accept new definitions, for the disputed\r\nreligious terms, which we have been discussing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am satisfied, Miss Houghton, that I have been quite too hasty in my\r\nconclusions! You have convinced me of the importance of teaching pure\r\npolitics to children, as a part of their religious training. With regard\r\nto other religious questions, you have answered my objections in a most\r\nmasterly manner! The practical religion, which you have so beautifully\r\noutlined and so clearly defined, seems worthy of all the eloquence which\r\nyou have bestowed upon it. That dreadful doctrine of total depravity,\r\nwhich you have so effectually demolished, has always been a repulsive\r\none to me! For years, it has been a tormenting theological thorn in my\r\nside! I could never quite reconcile its existence, with the overruling\r\ndominion of an all-wise Creator; the very embodiment of Infinite\r\ngoodness. I may as well say frankly, that I have often tried to find\r\nsome good reason for denying it! Now, I have found one, that will\r\nsatisfy my conscience. With the vexing doctrine of total depravity\r\neliminated from the religious problem, a definition for the term,\r\npractical religion, becomes much more simple. A new light is thrown on\r\nthe whole subject. Just at present, under the influence of this light, I\r\nam inclined to think, that your statements and your premises, are all\r\ntrue. Granting this, I will cheerfully admit, that the people of\r\nSolaris, are nobly living practical religious lives. I am very much\r\ninterested in the wonderful claims of this new religion. I trust, that\r\nafter some weeks of careful examination, I may be able to accept them\r\nwithout one single reservation. After that, I venture to promise, that\r\nwe shall be able to agree on a satisfactory definition, for all disputed\r\nreligious terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo! George! Now, you are talking more like your old self, more like\r\na reasonable man. You are making great progress, in mastering the\r\nunderlying principles and practical work of the co-operative movement! I\r\nthink, Miss Houghton, that you ought to join in offering\r\ncongratulations. Will you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Flagg! I shall be glad to do so! First, I want to compliment\r\nMr. Gaylord, on his excellence as a listener! Then again, I wish to\r\nthank him, for his kindly summing up, of the impressions, which came to\r\nhim from my rather long sermon on practical religion.\r\n\r\n\"Now gentlemen, you must excuse me! I have an engagement, which demands\r\nmy immediate presence at the kindergarten.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nRURAL LIFE UNDER THE REIGN OF CO-OPERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I wish, Fillmore,\" said George Gaylord, \"to question your statement, as\r\nto the ability of the co-operative movement, to check the rush from\r\ncountry to city life. The tide of the movement is a strong one, that has\r\nbeen constantly increasing in volume, for the past twenty years. I fear\r\nthat even the popular co-operative movement, will fail to turn the\r\nflood.\"\r\n\r\n\"The thing is sure to be accomplished, George! But, to understand the\r\nworkings of the underlying force, which shall make this change possible,\r\nwe must first study the units of rural society. Of course, the financial\r\nbasis of these units, must be supported by agriculture. Agriculture is,\r\nand must continue to be the main support of all rural populations. Fifty\r\nyears ago, agriculture as a whole, comprised a vast collection of small\r\nfarms and farmers. Then, the small farmer and his family, as the stable\r\nunit of suburban society, was financially and practically independent.\r\nQuestions of over-production of food products, rise or fall in the price\r\nof exchange, panic in the money market, or an adverse balance of trade,\r\ndisturbed them not.\r\n\r\n\"Under the spur of necessity, and as a part of the legitimate farm work,\r\nthe farmer and his family, in a crude way, practiced many of the\r\nindustrial arts, such as leather working, harness making, boot and shoe\r\nmaking, cloth making, the carding, spinning and weaving of wool; the\r\npreparation, spinning and weaving of flax or linen fabrics; the\r\nmanufacture of many farm implements, brooms, baskets, harrows, sleds and\r\ncarts; tailoring, making all kinds of underwear, hosiery, gloves and\r\nmittens; linen furnishings, for table and bed, together with many other\r\narticles of household use. Often, the forge and the anvil, with tools\r\nfor rough iron working, were added to the equipment of the farm. In\r\nthose days, farming required a knowledge of the use of tools; the\r\nsquare, the level, the plumb-bob; the hammer, the saw and the plane;\r\nwere as necessary to the farmer, as they were to the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"If we carefully study the significance of these things, we shall soon\r\ndiscover, that in reality those farms were practically, combined\r\nagricultural and manufacturing institutions, which were self-supporting\r\nand self-sustaining to such an extent, that farm people were the most\r\nindependent on the face of the globe. As such, these small farm centers\r\nwere potent factors, in swiftly advancing the permanent wealth and\r\ncivilization of rural society. Born and trained in this practical school\r\nof life; financially unshackled, therefore politically free; our farmers\r\nof fifty years ago, developed a spirit of sturdy independence, a\r\npatriotic devotion, a steadfastness of purpose, a self-confidence, and a\r\npower of the initiative, which made them the pride and the bulwark of\r\nthe nation. They were the well trained, trustworthy citizens, of a true\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\n\"Evolutionary progress, moves forward by waves. The depression between\r\nthe crest of the last and the summit of the succeeding wave, represents\r\nthe transition, from one step of progress to the next higher. Therefore,\r\nperiods of depression, need not cause alarm, they are in reality\r\nprophecies of progress. Let us apply this evolutionary law to\r\nagriculture and its people, as being in the transition stage, during the\r\npast forty years.\r\n\r\n\"Since the beginning of the last half of the nineteenth century, the\r\nseparation between agriculture and manufacture has been going forward,\r\nthe gulf between them becoming wider and more absolute, with each\r\nsucceeding year. Invention, improved machinery, combinations of capital,\r\nthe sub-division of the various trades into specialties, leaving the\r\nworker, master of none; all have served to develop the entire system of\r\nmanufacturing industries, to a degree out of all harmony with the tardy\r\nprogress made by agriculture. The mining and manufacturing craze, has\r\nswallowed up all other interests. Like a whirlwind, it has spread over\r\nthe land, drawing into the ranks of its toilers hosts of agricultural\r\nworkers; thus swelling the army, producing manufactured articles, and\r\ncorrespondingly reducing the home market for such things.\r\n\r\n\"These conditions have naturally produced a congested market. Logically,\r\nthere has followed, periods of stagnation, labor riots on account of\r\nreduced wages, periods of enforced idleness, and panics in the money\r\nmarket; all culminating in a loud demand for relief from the burden of\r\nover-production, by securing control of foreign markets. So completely\r\nhas the manufacturing craze dominated the commercial and political\r\neconomy of the republic, that both leaders and people are blind to the\r\nreal cause of the calamity. An aggressive and progressive minority begin\r\nto realize, that the laborer and the farmer are no longer free, that\r\nthey are the slaves of capital with its factories and machines, or of\r\nrailroad combines, which control all lines of transportation. But no one\r\nsufficiently understands the situation, to be able to answer why.\r\n\r\n\"Now let us study the history of agriculture, during the past forty\r\nyears. This trying period of transition, has been marked by many\r\nchanges. The small farm family, shorn of its ability to manufacture,\r\neven in a crude way; for shoes, clothing, bedding and table linen, must\r\npatronize factories located in distant cities. In order to pay for these\r\nthings, much farm produce must be shipped to remote markets. In both\r\ncases, such heavy freights, commissions and profits, are paid to lines\r\nof transportation, middle men and handlers, that at the end of the\r\nyear, the farmer's net proceeds are reduced to zero, or at least very\r\nclose to that point. If the farmer be in debt, he finds himself unable\r\nto pay the interest on the indebtedness. If the farm represents much\r\ninvested capital, the net income of the farm becomes too meagre to pay\r\neven a moderate rate of interest on its cost value; therefore its\r\nselling value must shrink to the level of its reduced income. In this\r\nway a large share of the available assets of the small farmer, are swept\r\naway. The savings of years, are swallowed up and lost. Savings, that in\r\nthe aggregate, amount to many millions of dollars. What has become of\r\nthese values? They have been absorbed by the cities and the railroad\r\nmonopolies, whose servants the cities are.\r\n\r\n\"Four decades of this process, has robbed the farm-center, as a unit of\r\nrural society, of its former wealth, independence and power. Rural\r\nsociety as a whole, is no stronger than its weakest unit. This is why\r\nagricultural districts are depopulated, while cities are over crowded.\r\nThese results are the work of the competitive system, with its wasteful,\r\nwicked methods of distribution and exchange, which so widely separates\r\nthe farm and the factory, the farmer and the artisan, the food and the\r\nconsumer.\r\n\r\n\"From another point of view, we may discover that inventive genius, has\r\nadded a long list of labor-saving machinery, to the equipment of the\r\nfarm. Since wheat growing, has become the leading crop, this expensive\r\nmachinery must be included in the outfit of every successful farm. The\r\nburden of this expense, has proved too great for the capacity of the\r\nsmall farm. It has encumbered thousands of them with an indebtedness so\r\nhopeless, that its annual interest swallows up the income of the farm.\r\nFrom these causes, a crisis in the affairs of agriculture has arisen,\r\nwhich has demanded larger farms, more capital, more brain force and more\r\nsystematic, better organized, co-operative labor. Hence, the evolution\r\nof the bonanza farm; with which the small farm can no longer compete.\r\nNotwithstanding its many wasteful methods, the bonanza farm has been a\r\nstep in the right direction. It has taught our agricultural people a\r\nvaluable lesson, as to what may be accomplished by the combined\r\nco-operation of brains, labor and capital. It has demonstrated the\r\nnecessity for the evolution of the co-operative farm. It has prepared\r\nthe way for it.\r\n\r\n\"With the advent of the co-operative farm, will come the beginning of a\r\nnew agricultural era. The co-operative farm village, with its well\r\norganized, allied industries, will again unite agriculture with\r\nmanufacture. The village will represent the new unit of rural society.\r\nThis unit will be free, independent and self-sustaining. The occupation\r\nof farming, will be lifted into a new realm. It will become the\r\noccupation of the noble, the cultured and the progressive. The people of\r\nthese farm centers, will form the warp and woof of agricultural society,\r\norganized as a whole. The presence of organized society, largely adds to\r\nthe value of all lands and to the value of agricultural and manufactured\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n\"The brilliant author of 'Volney's Ruins,' well understood the force of\r\nthis principle as applied to increasing agricultural wealth, and at the\r\nsame time largely adding to the general prosperity of the State. In an\r\nessay published in 1790, Volney lays down the following principles: 'The\r\nforce of a State is in proportion to its population; population is in\r\nproportion to plenty; plenty is in proportion to tillage; and tillage,\r\nto personal and immediate interest, that is to the spirit of property.\r\nWhence it follows, that the nearer the cultivator approaches the passive\r\ncondition of a mercenary, the less industry and activity are to be\r\nexpected from him; and, on the other hand, the nearer he is to the\r\ncondition of a free and entire proprietor, the more extension he gives\r\nto his own forces, to the produce of his lands, and to the general\r\nprosperity of the State.'\r\n\r\n\"Each co-operative farm, will become a new center of permanent wealth; a\r\nnew center of social progress; of organized labor; of distribution and\r\nexchange. These new centers, by again bringing together the food and the\r\nconsumer, will save millions for themselves, which under the competitive\r\nsystem, were thrown away in freights and commissions. As these farm\r\ncenters continue to increase, they may stretch away in one unbroken\r\nchain, perhaps five hundred miles in length. Each link in the chain,\r\nwill be a five or ten-mile boulevard. Altogether, forming one continuous\r\nsystem of broad, free highways, the finest the world ever saw! Aided by\r\ntrains of horseless carriages, there will be developed between the\r\ncenters along this highway, a new system of transportation,\r\ndistribution, commerce and exchange. With the establishment of each new\r\nsystem, the co-operative movement will gain an added impetus. The\r\ncenters of exchange, distribution and commerce, located in great cities,\r\nwill gradually lose their dominancy. The long lines of monopolized\r\nrailroads, connecting these cities, will as surely lose a large\r\nproportion of their traffic. The magnetic wealth and bustle of the great\r\ncity, will lose its attractive power. As a consequence, and by the\r\naction of a natural law, the tide of wealth and population, will flow\r\nback to the country; with its meadows and fields, its mountains and\r\nstreams, its sunshine, blue skies, pure air and wholesome, enjoyable\r\nvillage life. Amid such surroundings, upright and just, fearless and\r\nfree, the model citizen of a true republic, may find a natural home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Fillmore, for the interruption! I freely concede the\r\ndesirability of the results, which you have so glowingly pictured.\r\nNevertheless, I cannot quite agree with you, about the existence of a\r\nlaw, through which the tide of wealth and population will again flow\r\ntowards the country. I am inclined to think, that facts and figures are\r\nagainst such a result. The statistics of the census of 1890, indicate\r\nthat about one-third of the population, and over seventy-five per cent\r\nof the wealth of the nation, were then located in the cities. A little\r\nlater, able thinkers and writers of the Josiah Strong type, proclaimed,\r\nthat by the middle of the twentieth century, this would be a nation of\r\ncities, with less than ten per cent of its wealth and population\r\nremaining rural. As startling as these predictions are, I very much\r\nfear, that the logic of events favor their fulfillment!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will give me a little more time George, I think I shall be able\r\nto show you where these writers erred, in reasoning from wrong premises.\r\nThey have judged the trend of events and the probable results that are\r\nto follow, from the standpoint of the competitive system. A system,\r\nwhich they have accepted without question as a permanent one, never to\r\nbe replaced by another. This was the fatal error, which has robbed their\r\nconclusions of all value.\r\n\r\n\"In discussing the status of our great cities, these writers all agree,\r\nthat they are a constant menace to the nation; centers of political\r\ncorruption, which are in every way antagonistic to the letter and spirit\r\nof a republican form of government; aggregations of the most dangerous\r\nelements of society, which are incapable of self-government. These\r\nadmissions have a wonderful significance. Let us examine them.\r\n\r\n\"The question of society, becomes a potent factor in the solution of\r\nthis problem. Society, like a great leviathan, covers the face of our\r\ncountry. Representing the aggregate of life, it affects all lives. As\r\nthe social side of the body politic, it has the power to strangle or to\r\nnourish, every interest which is dear to those lives. Dominant society,\r\nis the support and inspiration of government. The excellence of any\r\ngovernment, may be measured by the excellence of the society upon which\r\nthat government is based. Under the standard of a republic, society may\r\nbe divided into two classes; the true and the false. Reasoning from\r\nthese premises, we may conclude, that in order to have a true republic,\r\nwe must first evolve a true society.\r\n\r\n\"The society representing the competitive system, has its centers or\r\nunits in our great cities. Its votaries, are worshippers of wealth. They\r\nare importers of foreign fashions, and foreign ideas of government. They\r\nbelieve in caste. They detest equality. They have no love and very\r\nlittle respect for the equal rights guaranteed by the Constitution. They\r\ndespise honest labor. They consider it menial, as a badge of servitude.\r\nThey believe that wealth is a power which can raise the wealthy few to\r\nthe dominancy of a privileged class. They believe that as members of\r\nthis class, they can treat all other classes as servitors and\r\ndependents, who may be hired to do anything for money. They view with\r\ncomplacency, the crowded populations of our great cities. The greater\r\nand more dense the mass of people, the larger, more dependent and more\r\nobsequious the class of servitors. They are naturally, more or less in\r\nsympathy with monarchial and despotic institutions. They believe that\r\nthe rulers, judges and law-makers, should come from the ranks of the\r\nprivileged class. They are out of harmony with the republic, because it\r\nis the true form of a co-operative government. Co-operation, they hate,\r\nit smacks of equality! They are devoted to the competitive system. They\r\nrecognize its power to maintain a perpetual warfare among competitors,\r\nwhich shall forever keep the main host in such abject poverty, that they\r\nwillingly become slaves to the wealthy. Having lost their independence,\r\nthe votes of these competitors are at the command of their financial\r\nmasters. Than this, nothing could be more harmful to the welfare of a\r\ntrue republic.\r\n\r\n\"This form of urban society, is the flower of the competitive system.\r\nThe tendency of this society is to so engender selfishness, and to so\r\ndestroy patriotism, that a multi-millionaire of the William Waldorf\r\nAstor type, deliberately achieves the acme of shame, by renouncing his\r\nallegiance to a country to which he owes everything. He expatriates\r\nhimself, and flies to the refuge of a monarchy, to escape the honest\r\nburden of a just taxation. A taxation based on an assessment of less\r\nthan one-third the rate, which is applied to the average farmer of the\r\nrepublic. One example of such ignominy, ought to teach every patriot,\r\nthat the true republic must be built on the solid foundation of a\r\nsociety and industrial system, which represents justice and equality.\r\n\r\n\"Let us now question the co-operative movement, with the purpose of\r\nascertaining its fitness to become the base of a new society, and also\r\nthe proper foundation for a true republic. In a society growing out of\r\nthe co-operative system, as our rural and agricultural societies may now\r\ndo. We find the conditions are reversed. Labor, is the badge of\r\nrespectability. It is the title to an honorable independence. In such a\r\nsociety, both men and women are free. All are co-operators, none are\r\nservitors. No beggars! No caste! The units of a co-operative society,\r\nare sound and healthy to the core. Co-operation, insures\r\nself-employment. Self-employment brings freedom, ambition, independence,\r\nself-respect, leisure and education; with all the comforts and\r\nrefinements of life. With these insured, the co-operator cannot be\r\nbought or corrupted by wealth. Each co-operator becomes a citizen, who\r\nwithout fear and without restraint, may speak, write and vote, in\r\naccordance with the highest dictates of conscience. A healthful degree\r\nof honorable, self-sustaining labor for all, is the key-note of this\r\nsocial organization. Men and women are placed on the same plane of\r\nequality, financially, socially and industrially. For woman, this is a\r\nmatter of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\n\"Productive co-operative labor, crowns woman with a self-supporting,\r\nself-respecting independence, which emphasizes her freedom from every\r\nform of bondage. In this, we have a perfect demonstration of the power\r\nof labor to bless humanity. Progressive life and invigorating labor, go\r\nhand in hand. One is the complement of the other. Labor as naturally\r\npromotes grace, strength, virtue and long life; as idleness breeds\r\nhelplessness, vice, disease and extinction. Here we discover the wisdom,\r\nand the universal application of nature's law of labor. This law\r\ndemands, that women who wish to become mothers of a dominant race, and\r\nwho desire to secure perpetuity and progress for that race, must take an\r\nactive part in some useful, productive labor. If we consider the\r\nsignificance of this demand, we shall perceive, that any form of social\r\nor industrial organization which denies this right to woman, or which\r\ntakes from her the opportunity, the necessity, or the desire to labor,\r\nbecomes her worst enemy, a foe to humanity, that is conspiring to reduce\r\nher to the degredation of a helpless dependent, a mere parasite. In her\r\ndeclaration, that 'The human female parasite, is the most deadly microbe\r\nwhich can make its appearance on the surface of any social organism;'\r\nOlive Schreiner has summed up in one sentence, the grave danger from\r\nthis source which threatens the race.\r\n\r\n\"The combined and marvelous effects of the co-operative system and\r\nsociety on the woman question, rightfully places that industrial and\r\nsocial system far above all others, in the choice of a secure basis for\r\nthe foundation of a true republic. In fact, George! After carefully\r\nconsidering the bearings of the questions involved, I feel sure that you\r\nwill heartily agree with me in the assertion, that co-operative society,\r\nis the very embodiment of even handed justice, in which the rights of\r\nall are considered. Furthermore, you will be willing to admit, that it\r\nteaches the value of labor, and how to discover its uses and abuses. In\r\neliminating its abuses, it will appear, that true progress, is to so\r\nimprove and increase the ease and attractiveness of all kinds of labor,\r\nthat they can no longer be classed as toil, or even disagreeable tasks.\r\nThis then, is the legitimate field of inventive genius. Success in this\r\nfield is assured, because it is in harmony with all laws of progress.\r\nEvery hardship, every difficulty and every danger, which is eliminated\r\nfrom physical labor, increases in the same proportion, the opportunity\r\nand the demand for mental labor. This demonstrates the action of\r\nnature's law of compensation, which in elevating the character of labor,\r\nmaintains its quantity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes Fillmore, I am convinced! I am willing to admit the truth of the\r\nassertions, which you have made concerning co-operative society, as the\r\nresult of the co-operative movement. No doubt, they are destined in the\r\nnear future to supersede the competitive system and the city society\r\nwhich grew out of it. As I view the situation now, that time cannot come\r\ntoo quickly! Yet, there is one point which still puzzles me. It is in\r\nconnection with the rapid improvement of labor saving agricultural\r\nmachinery, which, as Josiah Strong says, will soon enable a few farmers\r\nto do all the farm work, forcing all other agriculturalists to seek\r\nemployment in manufacturing cities. How can you answer that argument,\r\nfrom the co-operative standpoint?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a pertinent question George, to which co-operation can furnish\r\nmany conclusive answers. Let us consider the significance, and the\r\nconclusiveness, of some of the following:\r\n\r\n\"Under the co-operative system, every new labor-saving machine applied\r\nto agriculture, means just so much added wealth for the farm colony. It\r\naffords that much additional income, for active workers; so much more\r\nmoney to swell the annuity fund, for the retired members; so much more\r\ncash capital, for the sinking fund, with which to purchase, and to\r\nretain the permanent control, of an ever-increasing series of\r\nco-operative farms, for the lasting benefit of their people. With\r\nco-operative genius to invent, and an abundance of capital with which to\r\nbuy, the advent of any conceivable quantity of improved machinery on the\r\nco-operative farm, would only serve to increase the wealth, leisure and\r\nindependence of the co-operators.\r\n\r\n\"Such well-conditioned people could not, under any circumstances, be\r\nforced to leave homes of luxury and refinement in the country, to become\r\nthe working slaves of a manufacturing syndicate in the city. Indeed! Why\r\nshould they? Why should these co-operators, or any one with the\r\nopportunity to become such, go to the city to accept an insufficient and\r\nuncertain wage; to be compelled to pay five prices for food, when a\r\nbetter and more abundant supply, could be raised on lands of their own,\r\nwith less than one-half the exertion? Having good homes of their own,\r\nwhy should these people pay exorbitant rents to owners of tenement\r\nhouses, for the poor privilege of living in stuffy rooms, choked with\r\nsmoke and filth, and surrounded by the clatter, the strife, the poverty\r\nand the soul-wearing competition of the great city.\r\n\r\n\"Why should they rob their children of health and happiness, by\r\ndepriving them of a natural birthright, healthful exercise, free access\r\nto the pure air, the bright sunshine, the blue sky and the unnumbered\r\ncharms of country life, with its fascination of ever changing landscape,\r\na picturesque mingling of verdure clad hills, green meadows, shady\r\nforests, clear lakes and bold mountains? Why should these children be\r\ncompelled to live a cramped, unnatural life, confined to the narrow\r\nstreets, poisoned both mentally and physically, by the foul air,\r\ndisease, corruption, crime and misery of the densely populated city? Why\r\nshould agriculturists, who are independent co-operative owners of the\r\nsoil, humiliate themselves by joining the vast army of struggling\r\ncompetitors, who throng the already overcrowded labor market in our\r\ngreat cities? Why should they be eager to become the financial and\r\npolitical slaves of the leaders of the competitive system; the social\r\nautocrats, who form the society of the 'Four Hundred?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Can a Josiah Strong answer these questions? No! Why not? Because, in\r\nblindly reasoning and writing from the competitive standpoint, he has\r\nquite overlooked the fact that agriculture is the base of all wealth. He\r\nhas forgotten, that as a class, agricultural people who own the farming\r\nlands of the country, hold the key to the situation. Made conscious of\r\ntheir strength by co-operation, they are the most independent people\r\nliving. They are in a position to dictate terms to all other classes.\r\nThey cannot be forced to do anything, which they do not wish to do. In\r\narriving at his conclusions, it seems quite probable that Josiah Strong\r\nhas made the serious mistake of accepting as true, a very prevalent\r\nidea, that in due course of business, (competitive business) all lands\r\neverywhere, would belong to the city capitalist; therefore, that all\r\nfarmers would then be tenants at will, who could be turned off the land\r\nat the caprice of the owner. In this fatal mistake, we discover the\r\nerror which has vitiated all premises from which he has been reasoning.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to the forceful lessons, taught by Henry George, to which our\r\nagricultural people have given two decades of careful study. They have\r\nlearned, that free access to land, is absolutely necessary to a natural\r\nenjoyment of life. They have learned, that for this reason, those who\r\nown land are masters of those who do not. With a sturdy independence\r\nwhich should characterize all citizens of a true republic, they have an\r\nintense antipathy towards all forms of slavery. Determined to remain\r\nfree; they have redoubled their efforts to possess, and to retain\r\npermanent control of lands, sufficient for themselves and their\r\nchildren. In this work, they have discovered that co-operation leads to\r\nperfect success.\r\n\r\n\"In answering other arguments advanced to show why the city should\r\ndominate the country, and therefore absorb its population; the question\r\nof rent plays an important part. It should be studied carefully. The law\r\nof rent, is an enigma to the poorer classes, upon whose necks its yoke\r\npresses as a grievous burden. They sweat and groan under the burden, but\r\ncan discover no way of escape. They must be educated. They must know the\r\ncause, before they can learn to avoid the effect.\r\n\r\n\"Rent, is a legal harness which enables the capitalist who owns houses\r\nand lands, to bind needy people to do his work. Through the exactions of\r\nrent, he can compel these people who can least afford to do it, to pay\r\nhis taxes, his interest on capital invested, his living expenses, his\r\ntraveling expenses, his insurance and such wide margins of profit, as\r\nnecessity, opportunity and favorable location, may allow him to take.\r\nRent values, like land values and market values, are exponents of social\r\norganization. Human lives, enter into the equation of these values. The\r\nabsence of people diminishes these values, the presence of people\r\nincreases them. For this reason, rents are highest in great cities,\r\nlowest in the sparsely settled country, touching zero on lands occupied\r\nby nomads. Land values, are affected in the same way. This will give us\r\na clue, to the transitory character of wealth composed of values. It\r\nwill give us another reason, for the shrinkage in value of farm lands,\r\nand the increased wealth of cities; which follows the migration of\r\npeople from country to city.\r\n\r\n\"We may now consider another important factor, which affects rent values\r\nin great cities. It is the spur of a sharp want, of the urgent necessity\r\nof helplessness, which must drive and control the actions of a large\r\nmajority of the inhabitants. The presence of these elements is\r\nnecessary, in order to create the highest markets for rents. The larger\r\nthe throng and the keener the necessities of the crowd of bidders\r\ncompeting, the higher the prices they will pay for rent. Under the reign\r\nof the competitive system, this is a conclusive demonstration of the\r\ntruth of the saying, 'That the necessities of the poor, are the\r\nopportunities of the rich.' Is anything further needed, to prove that\r\nthe competitive system is the essence of a cruel barbarism, which blots\r\nthe civilization and shames the humanity of the republic? Why not change\r\nit for the co-operative system?\r\n\r\n\"Under the progressive and beneficent reign of co-operation, there would\r\nbe homes for the homeless, land for the landless, work for the\r\nunemployed and independence for all. This would mean, a total absence of\r\nwant; that imperative spur, which is so necessary to the life of\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n\"Transportation and taxation, are two factors yet unnoticed, which\r\nmaterially affect rent values in great cities.\r\n\r\n\"Taking up the question of transportation; we soon discover its\r\nimportance. The great manufacturing city, is the center of a complete\r\nnetwork of railroads. The inhabitants of the city, are at the mercy of\r\nthese railroads. Nominally, they are supposed to be competing lines. As\r\na matter of fact, by means of traffic association, they become one huge,\r\nconsolidated monopoly. A monopoly so dangerous, so powerful, so\r\nunscrupulous, and so voracious, that it does not hesitate in fixing and\r\nmaintaining rates so exorbitant, as to be actually prohibitory, at least\r\nso far as two-thirds of the city dwellers are concerned. Meanwhile the\r\nmonopoly arbitrarily depresses rents and land values in the country,\r\nwhile it increases them in the city.\r\n\r\n\"Let me give you an illustration of the methods, by which these results\r\nare accomplished. Take if you please, the case of an average city,\r\nfactory-worker; receiving an average wage of one dollar and fifty cents\r\nper day. On this wage, he has a family to support. In the country,\r\nthirty miles away, he can have a comfortable house, with a nice large\r\ngarden, for the moderate rent of five dollars per month. A most\r\ndesirable home! But, here comes the opportunity for the railroad! A ten\r\ncent fare each way, six days in the week, would pay the railroad a\r\nhandsome profit. But, a handsome profit does not satisfy a monopoly! The\r\nhandsome profit must be doubled six times, before it will consent to\r\nserve the public! As a result, this workman, not having the ready cash\r\nwith which to purchase a monthly commutation ticket, must pay to the\r\nmonopoly, at its lowest rate (two cents per mile) the gross amount of\r\none dollar and twenty cents per day for transportation. Subtract this\r\nsum from the workman's daily wage; there will remain the scant trifle of\r\nthirty cents, with which to pay bills for food, fuel, clothing,\r\nmedicine and other family expenses. Utterly impossible! Even if the\r\nowner of the country house and lot, should consent to reduce its price\r\nand its rent one-half, the workman would still be prohibited by the\r\nrailroad, from taking advantage of the reduction. He would gladly pay\r\nthe ten cent fare, for then he would be able to pay ten dollars per\r\nmonth rent, for the luxury of occupying such a desirable country home.\r\nThis would be a blessing to all interested parties; still, it cannot be,\r\nbecause the monopoly says no! Being a monopoly under the protection of\r\nthe competitive system, its dictates may not be questioned.\r\n\r\n\"Although, the case cited, may be duplicated a thousand times, every day\r\nin the week, in every large city of the republic; yet, everywhere, on\r\nall possible occasions, the common sense of the people is outraged, and\r\ntheir ears offended, by the loud shouts of the competitive leaders, who\r\npraise without stint the great usefulness of the monopolistic trust.\r\nSolemn as owls, with an air of great learning, they assure the people\r\nthat these beneficent trusts, are the natural outgrowth of high-grade\r\nbusiness methods, which must be let alone. Do the poor people, the\r\nfarmers, the country land owners, and the working men, join in these\r\nshoutings? Obviously and most assuredly, they do not!\r\n\r\n\"Let us now follow our factory workman back to the city, for the purpose\r\nof noting the effect of this monopolized transportation, on city rents.\r\nBaffled in his desire to live in the country, he seeks to make the best\r\nof a bad situation. As a consequence, he is obliged to pay to the owner\r\nof some tenement house, a rental of fifteen dollars per month for three\r\nsmall rooms; poorly ventilated, unfurnished and unheated. These rooms\r\nare so undesirable on account of difficult access, bad location,\r\nunsavory smells, and the immediate presence of other tenants in the\r\nhouse, who are quarrelsome, drunken, filthy and generally disreputable;\r\nthat but for the prohibitory tariff maintained by the railroads they\r\nwould remain unoccupied, even if the rent should be reduced to seven\r\ndollars and fifty cents per month. However, poor workmen receiving scant\r\nwages, may not expect to be choosers. They with their wives and\r\nchildren, must ever bravely strive to adjust themselves to their\r\nenvironments, which more often than otherwise, prove cruelly bitter and\r\noppressive.\r\n\r\n\"In the case of our artisan, who is a brave, industrious, hopeful\r\nfellow; after paying his rent, he will have left from his monthly wages,\r\nthe small sum of twenty-one dollars. Providing of course, that\r\nthroughout the month, he has been so fortunate as to remain well and to\r\nlose no time. With this amount, (seventy cents per day) he must manage\r\nas best he can, under such adverse circumstances, to feed, warm, clothe,\r\nshoe, and protect his family. With such a meagre sum to supply so many\r\nwants, it is impossible for him, even under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances, to make petty savings with which to meet emergencies.\r\nWhen the misfortune of sickness overtakes him, the situation becomes\r\nappalling!\r\n\r\n\"From this illustration, we may judge how much the city is indebted to\r\nthe railroad monopoly for its high rents. To great cities, high rent is\r\na matter of the utmost importance. Take all rent advantages from them,\r\nand the entire list of their manufacturing industries, could be carried\r\non in country villages with equal profit. It is quite evident then,\r\nthat these cities are alive to the fact that rent is a measure of the\r\nvalue of locations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before going farther, Fillmore, allow me to inquire! Why could not\r\nthese working men and their families, who are confined to the city by\r\nthe high rates of the railroad monopoly, find cheap country homes near\r\nthe city; say within a radius of from five to ten miles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you George, for such an opportune question! Its answer leads\r\ndirectly to a discussion of the question of taxation.\r\n\r\n\"A land monopoly, is more to be feared, more harmful to the poor and\r\nmore disastrous to the interests of the general public, than any other\r\nkind. The worst form of land monopoly, may be found in full force, along\r\nthe outskirts of large cities. These monopolies are made possible, by\r\nthe unjust application of a faulty system of taxation.\r\n\r\n\"As a preliminary step, a hungry host of individual capitalists and land\r\nsyndicates, proceed to purchase large tracts of adjacent lands at farm\r\nprices. These lands are then sub-divided into villa sites, and into a\r\nvariety of sizes of town lots. Prices are placed on these lots, which\r\nwould about equal the value of the ground, when in course of time, at\r\nthe edge of the city, they should be covered by dwellings or business\r\nhouses. This accomplished, the holders like cormorants, sit and wait for\r\nthe growth of the city and the efforts and capital of other people, to\r\nso increase the value of their holdings, that they can realize their\r\nprices and take their profits. These periods of waiting, may cover a\r\nlong time, often, from one to twenty years. Meanwhile, these monopolized\r\nlands are kept out of use, because on account of high price, they cannot\r\nbe used for agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\n\"Why can these land monopolists afford to wait so long? Because an\r\ninequitable system of taxation, discriminates in their favor; offering\r\naid and encouragement for them to do so. Without this aid, it would be\r\nimpossible to keep these lands out of use.\r\n\r\n\"How can this happen? In the first place, these sub-divided lands, as a\r\nwhole in large tracts, are assessed at the rural rates applied to unused\r\nand unoccupied lands. These assessed values, may be so low, as to be\r\nless than one per cent of the asking price of the lots. As time passes,\r\nthey are liable to be slowly increased. Under such a discriminating\r\nsystem of assessment, the taxes that may be collected, are merely\r\nnominal. This unequal system of taxation, is applied, in a proportionate\r\ndegree, to all unoccupied lands inside the city limits, which are held\r\nout of use by the land speculators.\r\n\r\n\"How does this state of affairs affect city rents, and at the same time,\r\nassist in preventing the poorer classes from enjoying the advantage of\r\ncountry homes? First, it establishes a broad zone of monopolized land\r\naround the city. This zone continues to increase in width with the\r\ngrowth of the city. Scattered through this zone, are many tracts of\r\nfarming lands in active use. For this reason, they have to bear an extra\r\nburden of taxes, in order to equalize the low rates on such large tracts\r\nof idle land. These heavy taxes are patiently borne by the resident\r\nfarmers, with the hope of reimbursement in the near future, by being\r\nable to sell their farms for extraordinary prices. In this way, abnormal\r\nprices become firmly established throughout the zone; which like some\r\ngreat barrier most effectively confines the working man and his family,\r\nto the narrow limits of a city tenement, with its high rents.\r\n\r\n\"If a builder with some idle capital, should wish to erect a\r\nconsiderable number of modest cottages, within the limits of this\r\nmonopolized zone; with the purpose of renting them to working men; he\r\nwould find it impossible, or at least impracticable to do so. Why?\r\nBecause he would have to pay almost city prices for the ground; then,\r\nhaving covered the lots with houses, he would be obliged to pay a heavy\r\npenalty for this outlay of capital, by the grievous burden of taxation,\r\nwhich would fall upon him. Houses built under these circumstances, could\r\nnot be let at a rent low enough to be within the means of the working\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"The number of people who are confined to city life by the causes named,\r\nis very large. Just how large, I have no means of ascertaining.\r\nFamilies, who are subsisting on incomes of ten dollars per week and\r\nless, furnish a large proportion of this number.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen that the disastrous crowding, the alarming density of our\r\nlarge city populations, is mainly due to two causes. High\r\ntransportation, caused by the railroad combine; and an outrageous land\r\nmonopoly, made possible by a bad system of taxation. We have seen, that\r\nthis dense mass of needy humanity, constantly creates such a fierce\r\ncompetition, that rents must grow higher and wages must grow lower. We\r\nhave seen, that the causes named, are steadily diminishing the wealth of\r\nrural sections, by transferring it to the great city. We have seen that\r\nthis whole movement, which tends to transform the great majority of the\r\nindependent citizens of a republic, into the financial slaves of an\r\noligarchy, is the natural outgrowth of the competitive system. Taught by\r\nhistory, we know, that as the oligarchy rises and reigns, the republic\r\ndies.\r\n\r\n\"Knowing the causes which have produced these conditions, we are\r\nprepared to discover, and to apply the most efficient remedies. It is\r\nonly by associated effort, that rural populations can successfully\r\noppose the concentration of wealth in cities. The well organized mass,\r\nbecomes a great power. The new century demands a new industrial\r\norganization. The co-operative system, answers the demand. It is in\r\nharmony with the idea, that life is the most precious of all things.\r\nTherefore, it recognizes that opportunity to labor, and to enjoy the\r\nfruits of that labor, is the highest privilege of life. Under the reign\r\nof co-operation, this is insured. United in congenial co-operative\r\nassociations, farming and working people in the country, reinforced by\r\nlarge numbers of recruits from cities, may build up for themselves, new\r\ncenters of combined industries, society, wealth, distribution, exchange,\r\neducation, amusement and insurance; which will place them in the ranks\r\nof the self-employed, who are financially and politically free. By\r\ngrowth and expansion, these centers will become the units of a vast\r\nco-operative system, which must soon wholly displace the competitive.\r\n\r\n\"The inspiring motive of this co-operative system, will be the elevation\r\nand perfection of human lives. To this end will tend the invention of\r\nevery labor-saving machine; increasing the product and shortening the\r\nhours of labor. With the physical man thus properly nourished and\r\ndeveloped; the intellectual and spiritual man, will for the first time\r\nin history, have the necessary conditions in which to expand, blossom\r\nand bear fruit. Under such circumstances, life in the country will be\r\nboth altruistic and idealistic. By comparison, life in cities will\r\nbecome a hardship which few will care to choose. The few, it may be\r\ntaken for granted, will be so bound to the wheels of Mammon that they\r\ncannot get away.\r\n\r\n\"The larger independence and better education of the co-operative\r\nmajority of voters, will soon enable them to find a relief for the\r\nimprisoned populations of cities, which are now confined by the pressure\r\nof land monopolies and railroad combines. They will see to it, that\r\nthese railroads become the property of the government; well knowing that\r\nthey can never be made to serve the public honestly, until the public\r\nowns them. As for the land monopolists, they will find their holdings so\r\nburdened with taxes, that they can no longer keep them out of use. The\r\nerection of fine buildings will be encouraged. Costly mansions,\r\ndwellings, or factories, will not increase the tax. With these barriers\r\nremoved, the densely packed populations will quickly expand. They will\r\nfly from center to circumference of the city. Later, they will be\r\nattracted to the country village, where more congenial homes and\r\nemployments await them. Then educated and emancipated, they will no\r\nlonger pay rent.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen that the economics of society vitally affect the status of\r\nhuman lives; physically, morally and spiritually; industrially,\r\nfinancially and politically.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen, that rural society, based on the co-operative farm colony\r\nas a unit; answers every demand for the protection and development of\r\nhuman life. We have seen that the inspiration of this society, is to\r\nsecure for all, a lasting reign of peace, plenty, harmony and progress;\r\na most convincing proof, that it is the ideal society on which to build\r\na true republic, that shall be self-sustaining.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen that the perfect emancipation of woman, and the exalted\r\nmotherhood, which is made possible by the advantages of the co-operative\r\nsystem, insures the permanency and the dominancy of a republic so\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\n\"In analyzing the workings of the competitive system, we have seen that\r\nits methods are those of war. In the never-ending struggle of competing\r\nstrife, opposing armies of human beings slowly grind each other to\r\ndeath; leaving unaccomplished the real object and purpose of life. This\r\nenormous waste of life, violates every principle of a republican form of\r\ngovernment. It aborts even the efforts of planetary evolution.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen that the competitive system produces monopolies and\r\ntrusts, with a constantly increasing tendency to concentrate wealth in\r\ncities; placing it in the hands of the few, who are the financial\r\nmasters of the many.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen that from the ranks of the wealthy few, come the leaders\r\nof competitive society, who make their strong holds in the great city.\r\nThey are the shining lights of the competitive system. They believe in a\r\nconstant warfare of competition, which brings suffering to the many and\r\nsuccess to the few. We have seen that a surfeit of wealth and power, has\r\nmade these leaders so despicably selfish and unpatriotic, that they are\r\nunwilling to pay a just proportion of tax for support of the government.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen that the monopolist, encouraged by the sympathy of\r\ncompetitive society, endeavors to monopolize administrative and\r\nexecutive functions. By means of unequal rates of taxation, and more\r\nespecially of unjust assessments, he is able to shift most of his taxes\r\nto the shoulders of farmers and small property holders in state, county\r\nand town. This outrageous evasion by the rich, of their just share of\r\nthe burdens of government, is shameful to the last degree! It robs the\r\npoor of all protection, that governments are bound to offer! It is a\r\ncrime against humanity! It is a sin against the perpetuity of the\r\nrepublic! It is anarchy! If a government is no longer able to protect\r\nits poor; then, such a government has forfeited all right to exist!\r\n\r\n\"We have seen that a true government, republican in form, is a\r\nco-operative institution, which must be based on justice, and equal\r\nrights, for all; thus recognizing the common brotherhood of humanity.\r\nOrganized and maintained for the purpose of conserving, developing and\r\nprotecting life; such a government, would at all times be guided by the\r\nbeacon light of the axiom, 'That the injury of one is the concern of\r\nall.' It would wisely measure its strength and perfection as a\r\ngovernment, by the strength and perfection of its weakest unit.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen that with members of competitive society, the accumulation\r\nof wealth, becomes the sole ambition of life; that they may enjoy the\r\nease, luxury and social power which follows. We have seen that wealth\r\ndevelops selfishness and idleness. Idleness breeds helplessness, vice,\r\ndisease, and extinction. The predominance of such a society, would mean\r\nthe death of the republic.\r\n\r\n\"Having compared the merits and demerits of the two industrial systems,\r\nand of their closely related societies; taking it for granted, that as\r\nthe highest expression of social evolution, the republic must endure;\r\nwhich, George, do you think will prove the true system, the true\r\nsociety, that must predominate; that must naturally develop most social\r\nand political power; most perfect conditions of life; most happiness?\"\r\n\r\n\"There can be but one answer, Fillmore! The co-operative is the true\r\nsystem, and the true society! You have made it very plain that the\r\nrepublic cannot endure without them. It is equally evident, that with\r\nrestraining influences removed, city populations in a large measure,\r\nwill again return to the country for homes; attracted thither by the\r\nmany advantages offered by co-operative village life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of homes, George, reminds me that I must now confer with you\r\nin regard to a personal matter, which may affect your work and your\r\nwelfare for many years. This is the fifteenth of September. You have now\r\nbeen in Solaris, a little over one month, with an opportunity to study\r\nthe co-operative movement quite extensively. I believe you are in\r\nharmony with it; and can do a good work for it.\r\n\r\n\"This office, as you know, is the present headquarters of the general\r\nmovement. Tomorrow I am going East, to be absent at least one month,\r\nperhaps three. I wish you, as my private secretary, to at once take\r\ncharge of the office. I can offer you a salary of $1,500 for the first\r\nyear. The office staff is a capable one, which will make your work quite\r\nlight. I have made arrangements with Mr. and Mrs. Gerrish and with Miss\r\nHoughton, to co-operate with you as advisers. Since the first\r\nestablishment of the office, Miss Houghton has so often volunteered to\r\nassist me, that she is now familiar with the routine work. Finally, I\r\nshall at all times while away, be within reach by phone or wire; by\r\nwhich I wish you to consult me whenever occasion may demand. What say\r\nyou, George! Can you accept my proposal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Fillmore, I accept without one moment's hesitation! I shall be\r\ndelighted with the opportunity to work for the interests of\r\nco-operation. You may trust me to do my best!\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Fillmore! I take it for granted, that before you return you\r\nwill meet Miss Fenwick, and her friend Mrs. Bainbridge, if so, please\r\npresent my regards.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not forget your message, friend Gaylord! Miss Fenwick is now at\r\nFairy-Fern-Cottage, on the Hudson. She will meet me at Fenwick Hall, in\r\nWashington, where we are to be married on the twentieth day of this\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\"The wedding is to be strictly private and informal, only Miss Fenwick's\r\nattorneys are to be present as the necessary witnesses. After the\r\nwedding, the customary tour will be omitted; leaving us free to remain\r\nat Fenwick Hall, until the inspiration of the moment brings the choice\r\nof some mountain or sea-side resort.\r\n\r\n\"I shall expect you, George, to mail weekly reports from the office, to\r\nFenwick Hall. Wire me for instructions, whenever you are in doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall obey your wishes to the letter, Fillmore! What you tell me of\r\nthe coming wedding, is glorious news! I congratulate you with all my\r\nheart, on your great good fortune! You deserve it; you have well earned\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nA TWENTIETH CENTURY HONEYMOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Fenwick Hall, in the early twilight of their wedding day, we find our\r\nhero and heroine, the bride and groom, now husband and wife. They are\r\nsitting side by side, hand in hand, looking forth from the large\r\nsouthern window of that magnificent tower room, hitherto known as the\r\nprivate retreat of Fern Fenwick. The outlook from that window was a\r\nrevelation of beauty, as perfect as a dream of fairy land.\r\n\r\nAs the twilight deepened, high in the southern sky, the full-orbed\r\nsplendor of a September moon, glorified with its soft radiance, the\r\nmarked beauty of the Capital City--the Pearl City of the republic. From\r\nthe mysterious depths of stilly night, intensifying the soothing charm\r\nof moonlight; there came softly stealing through the open window, the\r\nbalmy airs of evening, laden with the fragrant breath of a thousand\r\nflowers. From the Aqueduct Bridge to Fort Foote, a long line of\r\nbrilliant light, with many a graceful curve, marked the pathway of the\r\nbroad Potomac, whose unruffled bosom shone like a mirror of burnished\r\nsilver. Stretching across the valley from distant heights, a fleecy veil\r\nof enchantment woven in the loom of mist, etherealized city and river,\r\ndome and monument, tower and steeple, cottage and castle; adding a weird\r\nbeauty to the magnificent array of public buildings, which owned the\r\nCapitol and the Library as chief. Above and beyond all else in its\r\nunapproachable glory, the Dome of the Capitol in the mellow, hazy\r\nmoonlight, shone resplendent as a matchless crown to the architecture\r\nof the Occident!\r\n\r\nResponsive to the spell woven by the fairy fingers of moonlight, in\r\nwhich soul and sense sink to the spiritual repose of that serene calm,\r\nwhere in silence, happiness of the purest type best expresses itself;\r\nthese newly wedded lovers, living in the inner world, lost to the outer,\r\nremained motionless and absorbed in the ecstasy of contemplation.\r\n\r\nFern was the first to break the silence. She said: \"My dear Fillmore!\r\nTell me, is this the beginning of some reign of enchantment? The\r\nculmination of love's dream? Are we waking or dreaming? Can it be\r\npossible, that this glorious moonlight, so auspiciously ushering in our\r\nhoneymoon, is typical and indicative of its endurance, of its unalloyed\r\nbrightness?\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife! Chosen one of all women! Your devoted lover for six years;\r\nhaving passed the stage of love at first sight, hopeless love,\r\nworshiping love from afar, patient love, love requited and love\r\nrewarded; I am now so happy, so unspeakably optimistic, that I accept\r\nwithout question the happy augury of enchanted moonlight, as being truly\r\nprophetic. Besides, having a wife so noble, so good and so wise, to make\r\nit possible; how could our honeymoon be other than the most delightful\r\never known to the history of love? You may trust me, dear heart, to do\r\nmy best towards making that prophecy come true!\"\r\n\r\n\"In discussing honeymoons, even my own; I may not be permitted to trust,\r\nin what is given to me to know. As a maiden of twenty-six summers, now\r\nyour wife; I know very well that a husband who is just, loving, noble\r\nand true, is the most important of all factors, in securing the\r\nperfection of the ideal honeymoon. That six-year ordeal of loyal,\r\npatient love, which you have so thoughtfully analyzed and classified,\r\nhas made you very dear to me! In overcoming this ordeal so victoriously,\r\nyou have displayed a strength of character which has commanded my\r\nadmiration. You have been unselfish, courageous, persistent of purpose,\r\ntrustful, thoughtfully sagacious, perfectly trustworthy, and strictly\r\nhonorable. For these characteristics, so like those possessed by my\r\nfather; I love you more than for all else. Since crowned with conscious\r\nlife, my father has been to me, the standard of an ideal man! If ever a\r\ndaughter worshipped a father; I was that daughter. In character, you, of\r\nall the men I have met, are the nearest like him. Stronger words of\r\npraise than these, the lips of a proud, loving wife, could not utter!\r\nNow Fillmore! My dear husband! I am going to kiss you, as an antidote;\r\nlest the fervor of my speech, should make you vain, just a little!\"\r\n\r\n\"The antidote seems to work like a charm! Yet, a speech so full of such\r\ncrushing praise, coming from the lips of the loveliest and most\r\nthoughtful of wives, is very provocative to vanity. It makes my case so\r\ndesperate, that it really requires heroic treatment. To make the\r\nantidote effective, I should say, increase the quantity of the dose;\r\nadminister very frequently!\r\n\r\n\"But seriously, my dear wife! I am overwhelmed by the tribute of praise,\r\nwhich you have paid to my character! To me, the character of Fennimore\r\nFenwick, is nobleness personified! To have my own continually compared\r\nwith one so exalted, is a very trying ordeal. I tremble for the\r\nconsequences! I am now so happy, that in the very selfishness of my\r\nlove for you, I may shatter your ideal. To disappoint you; would be to\r\nforfeit my paradise! In times of trial, I shall appeal to you as the\r\nnoblest and best of wives, to use your highest gifts of occult power to\r\nassist me in retaining your respect, admiration and love. Meanwhile, my\r\ndear wife! I shall cherish in my heart, the memory of your tribute, as a\r\ntalisman, as a perpetual inspiration to live up to my highest ideal!\r\nWhatever happens, I shall be myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, Fillmore, has the true ring of your natural nobility! Be\r\nyourself, and we shall be lovers forever! With that question settled;\r\nunder the inspiration of this lovely moon, let us commence the\r\nconstruction of our castles in the air. In marrying a woman with a great\r\nfortune, you have pledged yourself to share equally with her, the\r\npleasures, cares and responsibilities of her riches. Remembering, that\r\nhenceforth, we are joint trustees, under my father's direction, for the\r\nwise use and distribution of this wealth. It becomes our duty to make\r\ncompetent and well-considered plans for the work. What say you, my dear\r\nhusband! Shall we not do well, if we devote a generous share of our\r\nhoneymoon to the making, development and perfection of these plans?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you propose, my dear Fern, will make me very happy! I shall be\r\ndelighted with the opportunity to relieve you of a portion of the burden\r\nof your responsibilities, by sharing them. How, and when shall we\r\ncommence the plan making?\"\r\n\r\n\"Before undertaking the plans, it will be necessary for us to ascertain\r\njust how much we are worth, financially speaking. For this purpose, we\r\nmust make a complete and carefully classified inventory of our\r\nproperties, both real and personal. This important task, we will take up\r\ntomorrow, working deliberately until it is finished. It is quite likely\r\nto prove a long one, bristling with interesting data, suggestive and\r\neducative, as to the extent of your newly assumed responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\"After the inventory is complete, we will each in favor of the other,\r\nmake and execute a will, conveying the property described by the\r\ninventory. Then, we shall be prepared for the accidents, emergencies and\r\nunexpected changes of a mortal existence.\r\n\r\n\"Having disposed of the wills, we will return to the inventory. Going\r\nover it without haste, item by item. While considering each one, I will\r\ngive its history; then, we will make a short note, embodying our\r\nindividual ideas as to the best present or future disposition of that\r\nparticular piece of property. These notes to be attached to the\r\ninventory. By the time we have finished this work, you will have\r\nacquired such a firm mental grasp of our financial situation, that you\r\ncan advise me wisely, or act alone, as the occasion may demand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, sweetheart! What of our coming conference with your father,\r\nFennimore Fenwick? Is that to be postponed until we have finished the\r\npreliminary work, which you have outlined?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lover! I would not have you take part in the consultation,\r\nwithout first being equipped with this important knowledge. Besides, it\r\nwas so understood, by father and myself, when we arranged to have the\r\nconference take place on the afternoon of the fifth day after the\r\nwedding. There will be plenty of time. You are perfectly satisfied with\r\nthe arrangement, are you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than satisfied, my good angel! I can hardly realize my good\r\nfortune! I am eager to begin the work. What a delightful time we shall\r\nhave! To have you introduce me to our wealth, by the way of this unique,\r\nhoneymoon program; is something very like a fairy story! I could not\r\ndevise or imagine anything more delightful!\r\n\r\n\"Six years ago, at the time of our meeting, I was hopeful and ambitious.\r\nMy heart was filled with an earnest longing for the fulfillment of my\r\none great purpose in life. But, how to accomplish that purpose, was\r\nhidden from me by the veil of the future. Then, I never dreamed that\r\nwaiting behind the veil, love was the goddess of good fortune, who was\r\nto guide me to success! It is the unexpected which always happens!\r\nThinking not of self; destiny smiled on my unselfishness, and kindly led\r\nme to my fate! Having met you, I dared to love! Discovering that you\r\ncherished a purpose in life like my own, I dared to hope! Trusting to\r\nlove, as the messenger of destiny; in the unalloyed happiness of this\r\nglorious honeymoon, I have reached the goal of all my ambitious hopes!\r\nWhen I reflect on the magical change of my environments, and the new\r\ncareer in life which has opened for me; I can appreciate the full\r\nsignificance of the miracle which love has wrought!\r\n\r\n\"Knowing the importance of unselfishness on the part of the individual,\r\nas a necessary factor in the successful co-operation of the multitude; I\r\nperceive that selfishness must be overcome by a comprehensive system of\r\neducation, organized for that particular purpose. The organization of\r\nsuch a system must be accomplished by a small number of enthusiasts, who\r\nare willing to devote their lives to it. This means, that they must be\r\npeople of wealth and leisure.\r\n\r\n\"As an evidence of appreciation of responsibility, for my stewardship\r\nof the wealth which you have bestowed upon me; I wish now to declare my\r\npurpose. It is, to devote the remainder of my life to this educational\r\nwork. It now comes to me, that this is the work described for us, in\r\nyour letter, written to me over thirty months ago; where, in a vision of\r\nthe future, you saw us united, side by side, hand in hand, fighting\r\nsuccessfully against the poverty breeding hosts of selfishness. From the\r\ninnermost depths of my being, I rejoice over this most fortunate\r\nopportunity, which permits me to take an active part in such an\r\nimportant work! My heart swells with pride and happiness, when I feel\r\nand know that I am to have the honor of standing by your side, in the\r\nfore-front of the fight!\r\n\r\n\"I can now appreciate the utility of my long apprenticeship on the\r\nco-operative farm. In no other way, could I have been so well prepared\r\nfor leadership in the educational movement. I have learned just what\r\nagricultural people need to make them perfect citizens of a perfected\r\nrepublic. A republic of peace, without a police; without the burden of a\r\nstanding army, to menace and oppress its citizens, because they are\r\nalready a law unto themselves, at peace with all the world. When I\r\nanalyze the influences which have inspired and led me, throughout this\r\nextraordinary course of training; I recognize the action of a dominant,\r\nguiding mind; the far-seeing wisdom of my noble friend and benefactor,\r\nFennimore Fenwick. To him, and to the spirit world, I shall ever be\r\nprofoundly grateful! Is it not a most beautiful illustration, of the\r\npower of spirits to co-operate with mortals?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true and rightly spoken, my prince of husbands! I too, am glad,\r\nthat during the six years of your preparatory training, destiny's\r\nmessenger--love--has guided you so wisely. With your intuitive nature, I\r\nam not surprised that you have divined so clearly, the general scope of\r\nthe life work, which my father has planned for us. At the coming\r\nconference, he is to unfold the details of the work. Let us well employ\r\nthe intervening time, in doing the preliminary work; which, as you have\r\nso well said, will give us an added relish for the enjoyment of our\r\ndelightful honeymoon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CRUSADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beautiful seance room at Fenwick Hall, was known to the chosen few,\r\nas the \"Tower of the Psychics.\" In fittings, furniture, and equipment,\r\nit was much the same as the square room in the central tower at Fairy\r\nFern Cottage. From the beginning, this room had been devoted to but one\r\npurpose; that of an audience chamber for the intercommunion of the Two\r\nWorlds, the spirit and the mortal. Every visiting mortal felt the\r\npresence of a refined spiritual atmosphere, a highly charged,\r\nelectrostatic potential, which made possible superior spiritual\r\nconditions. In this room, Fennimore Fenwick was at home, to the chosen\r\nfew of his friends on the mortal plane of existence. On the afternoon of\r\nthe conference, we find our hero and heroine in this room, awaiting the\r\ncoming of Fennimore Fenwick.\r\n\r\nWhile Fillmore was admiring the full length, life size painting of his\r\nspiritual friend and benefactor, which hung on the wall opposite the\r\nentrance to the room; the familiar voice of the original, through the\r\ntrumpet very near, gave him a cordial greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, my son! How glad I am, to welcome you to Fenwick Hall, as\r\nits new master! May your reign here as such, prove long and prosperous!\r\nIn the enthusiasm of my fatherly pride, allow me to congratulate you on\r\nyour rare good fortune, in winning the hand and heart of my daughter,\r\nFern. She is a pearl above price! Ever love her devotedly, my boy!\r\nCherish her tenderly, as the brightest jewel in your crown of life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Fenwick! For your affectionate and kindly words of\r\nwelcome! To me, they are more gracious, more inspiring and more\r\ndelightful, than words can express! They have so taken me by surprise,\r\nthat I am overwhelmed by the strong tide of emotions welling up from my\r\ngrateful heart! As to your commands in relation to my precious wife; you\r\nmay trust me! Waking or sleeping, I shall never forget them! They are\r\nburned into my heart, by the intensity of my love for her, by the force\r\nof my lasting esteem and admiration for you! How can I ever properly\r\nthank you, my noble benefactor, for your great goodness to me; for your\r\nsupreme confidence in my integrity? In return, I can only ask you to\r\naccept my pledge, to ever strive to merit that confidence!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not thank me, my son! Thank Love! Destiny's messenger; who, as a\r\nreward for your unselfishness, has kindly led you to the goal of your\r\npresent happiness!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, my beloved daughter! Are you quite happy! May I also\r\ncongratulate you, on having so wisely chosen a husband, who is in every\r\nway worthy? Do you remember the promise I made to you, on the night of\r\nmy transition? A promise to bring to your side, a friend, a counselor, a\r\nprotector, whose wisdom and integrity, should at all times, prove\r\nsufficient for the needs of the hour. Are you satisfied, my dear girl?\r\nHave I faithfully kept my promise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father! I am more than satisfied! I am a contented woman, I am\r\nvery happy! The quiet delicious calm of my happiness, is a new\r\nexperience for me. Heretofore, I had supposed that happy women must be\r\nvivacious and voluble, from the very effervescence of their happiness.\r\nNow I know that it is not so. Your characteristic words of praise, for\r\nthe one I have chosen as a husband, have made me very proud of him and\r\ndeeply grateful to you! In him, I have found the promised friend,\r\ncounselor and protector; also, an ideal lover. But, my dearest, kindest,\r\nbest of fathers; you know very well, that to trust you implicitly, is a\r\nlaw of my life! I have always trusted you! Therefore, I am not\r\ndisappointed; neither am I very much surprised. I am just perfectly\r\nhappy. That is the whole story in a nutshell!\"\r\n\r\n\"This is as it should be, my children! When I first saw you, Fillmore, I\r\nfelt intuitively, that you and Fern were made for each other. I knew I\r\ncould trust you together, to finish my work. Now, I rejoice, that my\r\nintuitions were so prophetic!\r\n\r\n\"In your work at Solaris Farm, Fillmore, you have succeeded beyond my\r\nmost sanguine hopes. I congratulate you heartily, my son, on this\r\ninitial success for the co-operative movement! This is but the beginning\r\nof the work. As we go farther, wider fields are opened for more extended\r\nefforts. You have already correctly surmised, that selfishness in\r\nhumanity has become so dominant, so crystallized, from long centuries\r\nunder the heartless reign of competition, that only a far-reaching, well\r\norganized, especially designed scheme of education, can conquer the\r\nevil. By means of this educational program, we shall be able to open the\r\neyes of both poor and rich, to the benefits of co-operation.\r\n\r\n\"It has been wisely and truthfully said, that: 'The destruction of the\r\npoor, is their poverty. That conversely, the poverty of the poor, is the\r\nreal power of the rich.' In these two short sentences, we have the most\r\nscathing indictment against present social and industrial conditions,\r\nthat could be made! These conditions are wickedly abnormal! They are\r\nentirely out of harmony with the law of progress, and of planetary\r\nevolution! To change them for something better, is the crying need of\r\nthe hour!\r\n\r\n\"It were a mercy to both rich and poor alike, to make them financially\r\nindependent of each other! Then, freed from the thraldom of selfishness,\r\nthey could discover and appreciate, each for themselves, the true object\r\nand purpose of human life. For this reason, our new educational\r\nmovement, must be so arranged, that it may successfully appeal to all\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n\"For the industrial classes, the agriculturalists and the artisans, we\r\ncan use the co-operative farm movement as a basis of education. As for\r\nthe wealthy remainder, they must first be taught to respect the\r\nsacredness and the true purpose of human life, before they can\r\ncontemplate any form of social or co-operative progress, with feelings\r\nother than contempt, or at least angry opposition. This is to be\r\nexpected. It is the natural outgrowth of the teachings of a society,\r\nwhich is controlled by the hierarchy of competition. Both the\r\nco-operative farm and the broader educational movement, are to be\r\nembraced by the work of the New Crusade.\r\n\r\n\"The New Crusade, is to be organized, promoted and maintained, for the\r\npeaceful conquest of poverty; and the consequent banishment of ignorance\r\nand crime. These grand purposes, shall be emblazoned on its banners,\r\nappealing to the chivalry and knighthood of the republic for support.\r\nNever before has the bugle of the crusader, blown the assembly call for\r\nso noble a cause! Victory for this glorious cause, means a recognition\r\nof the true nobility of labor: The establishment of peace on earth, and\r\nhappiness for all: An abundant harvest, for all productive toil: The\r\nsacredness and divine significance of life: The brotherhood of humanity:\r\nAnd the solidarity of all social interests. To the victors, shall come\r\nthe well earned plaudits of a thousand future generations; whose sons\r\nand daughters shall chant the story of the unparalleled chivalry of such\r\nnoble, unselfish deeds!\r\n\r\n\"To you, my children, is assigned the task and the honor of inaugurating\r\nthis peaceful campaign. From you, it will demand extraordinary activity,\r\ncourage and administrative ability; reinforced by large sums of money.\r\nFortunately, the Fenwick fortune is ample. Use it without stint. Fenwick\r\nHall, is roomy and well fitted for the headquarters of the New Crusade;\r\nand for the housing of its organizing staff; which, from the magnitude\r\nof the work, will be a large one. A bureau of literature must be formed.\r\nA newspaper and a magazine, devoted to the cause of the Crusade, must be\r\npublished. They must be the best of their kind. The editorial talent\r\nmust be of the highest order, the ablest in the land. Every State in the\r\nRepublic, must be made a department of the Crusade. A select army corps\r\nof teachers, organizers and leaders, must be assembled, trained and\r\nthoroughly prepared, to take charge of these departments. They will be\r\nthe executive and recruiting officers of the Crusade; rendering weekly\r\nreports to the headquarters in Washington. Every co-operative farm, will\r\nbecome an outpost and a recruiting station; every State, a grand\r\nencampment.\r\n\r\n\"In recruiting crusaders from the ranks of the wealthy, a special effort\r\nshould be made, to have them take up the cause as a fashionable fad.\r\nThey can be diplomatically led, where they cannot be coaxed or driven.\r\nIn the face of any opposition they may display, it must ever be borne in\r\nmind, that the hearts of nine-tenths of the wealthy, are good and true.\r\nTheir natural promptings are to do right; to use their riches for the\r\nadvancement of science, and for the cause of humanity. They would do\r\nbetter, if they only knew how. They must be educated. The competitive\r\nsystem, under which they were born, trained and made rich, is at fault.\r\nBy it, they have been taught, that poverty is a necessary and permanent\r\nstate; to which, a large majority of the people of the earth, are\r\nassigned by the action of a divine law. Therefore, any attempt to banish\r\npoverty would be not only useless, but actually sinful. Nevertheless,\r\nprompted by a higher law, many of them annually dispense large sums in\r\ncharity. Under the competitive system, charity only aggravates the\r\nmalady. It is money thrown away! As the recipients are thus enabled to\r\nwork for less wages; increasing the gains of competitive masters; and\r\nfinally, swelling the ranks of the helpless poor. After a few trials,\r\neven the most persistent alms-giver soon discovers, that as an antidote\r\nto poverty, charity is a wretched failure. Taking it for granted, that\r\nthe competitive system is a permanent one which is to endure forever, he\r\ngives up the problem as hopeless.\r\n\r\n\"It is to be the business of the New Crusade, to show why the\r\nco-operative should be substituted for the competitive system. It must\r\nteach the wealthy classes, the vast importance of the great lesson\r\ntaught at Solaris. Namely, that by organized, unselfish co-operation;\r\nindependent self-employment, producing an abundance for all, may be\r\nspeedily and practicably substituted for every form of poverty. The\r\nCrusade must demonstrate, that ignorance, poverty and crime, are\r\nhandmaidens, which cannot exist apart. That if one-half the money\r\nexpended for charity during the past fifty years, had been used to\r\npromote co-operative self-employment, poverty, tramps and ignorance,\r\nwould now be things of the past.\r\n\r\n\"To the people of the republic at large, must be taught the significance\r\nof the contrast between the war-like competitive system, and the\r\npeaceful methods of a co-operative association. Co-operation, makes\r\ncombined individual effort, equal to the wealth of independence. The\r\nco-operator, being self-employed, no longer strives to displace a fellow\r\nworkman by offering service at a lower price.\r\n\r\n\"Competition, emphasizes the poverty and helplessness of the individual,\r\nbecause it sets every man against his neighbor, against the whole world.\r\nThe competitor deliberately shuts himself away from all gain that might\r\ncome to him from the force and effectiveness of associated effort. He\r\nloses all faith in mankind; in honesty and justice. He views the good\r\nfortune of a fellow toiler, as a personal injury, which he ought to\r\nresent. In fact, he becomes too selfish to even be patriotic!\r\n\r\n\"The quickest way to convince the people of the barbarism, the cruelty,\r\nand the wickedness of such a system, is to establish a co-operative farm\r\nin every available township throughout the land. The free, healthy,\r\ntrained, and well-educated social communities, growing up on these\r\nfarms, will become the units of a true society; the underlying\r\nfoundation, on which to build the true republic.\r\n\r\n\"Society dominates the political expression of nations. It molds and\r\ncontrols public opinion, business methods and commercial usage. Under\r\nthe reign of competitive business and society, the market is largely\r\ncomposed of small wage earners, whose necessities are so great, whose\r\ntenure of employment is so uncertain, and whose wages are so scanty;\r\nthat they are forced to buy the cheapest of everything. On the part of\r\ntradespeople, the fierce competition to control this cheap market,\r\nencourages the use of an outrageous system of food adulteration, and\r\nwith it, every possible degree of lying, cheating, fraud and deception;\r\nuntil the moral tone of both business and society, has become blunted;\r\nyes, well nigh destroyed. As a result of this shameful state of\r\ncommercial affairs, the successful man in any line of business, can no\r\nlonger afford to be honest. He knows very well, that in competitive\r\nbusiness, he can utterly ignore honor, conscience, and self-respect,\r\nwithout losing the approval of competitive society. Can such a rotten\r\nsociety ever become a safe foundation for the government of a true\r\nrepublic?\r\n\r\n\"It is to be the mission of the New Crusade to teach and to demonstrate,\r\nthat under the reign of a co-operative system, and society, these\r\nconditions would be reversed. All incentives to cheapen goods, or to\r\nadulterate food products, would vanish. The co-operators would then form\r\nthe bulk of the market. Buying at wholesale collectively, to sell to\r\nthemselves individually; they would be in a financial condition to pay\r\nremunerative prices, for whatever was genuine, pure, wholesome, good,\r\nreliable and lasting. Inferior articles, they would not purchase at any\r\nprice. The demand for cheap stuff would cease. The dominant motive of\r\nthe commercial world, would be revolutionized. Among manufacturers and\r\nproducers, the cry would be, not how cheap, but how excellent, can we\r\nmake our goods! The long-practiced, skillful chicanery of competitive\r\nmethods, would be at a discount; they would be worse than useless!\r\nHonest men could then engage in business, without violating either\r\nhonor, or conscience! Cheating and lying, would no longer form a part of\r\nthe business code! At all times, and under all circumstances, to respect\r\nthe sacredness of life, and the natural rights of man, would become the\r\nuniversal watchword! Justice would dethrone charity! The high moral tone\r\nof the industrial and commercial world, would pervade the social and\r\npolitical. The injury of the weakest, would become the concern of the\r\nstrongest. The rising tide of humanitarianism would submerge poverty.\r\nThe fires of ignorance and crime, would be extinguished by its\r\nconquering flood.\r\n\r\n\"Than this, no lesson more important, could be taught to the people. The\r\nscales of selfishness having fallen from their eyes, they can be made to\r\nunderstand, that all of these wonderful things may be accomplished,\r\nquickly and easily, by the plain, practical methods of unselfish\r\nco-operation. Methods, whose assured results are as easily demonstrable,\r\nas the solution of a mathematical problem. Once convinced, they will\r\nmake haste to discard the wasteful methods of the competitive system;\r\nsubstituting therefor, the co-operative conservation of national wealth.\r\nIn this conservation, the wealth of the unit, will be the measure of the\r\nwealth of the nation.\r\n\r\n\"This conservation will usher in a new era, of the means of gathering,\r\nand of the higher uses of national wealth. A magnificent national fund,\r\naccumulated for the benefit, education, refinement and enjoyment of all.\r\nThe swiftness of its accumulation and the magnitude of its billions,\r\nwill become the marvel of the world! By contrast, all former standards\r\nof the wealth of nations, will fade and shrink to insignificance! Why\r\nmust this prove true? Because, under the beneficent reign of\r\nco-operative equality, money, shorn of its power, would only be valued\r\nfor its use. The store of national wealth, being for the equal use and\r\nbenefit of every individual citizen; the incentive for its accumulation,\r\nwould inspire all alike. As a result, the people as a mass would enjoy\r\nall the benefits of great wealth, minus its burdens, abuses, temptations\r\nand dangers. In this, any one of them might be envied by the competitive\r\nmillionaires.\r\n\r\n\"Among the many lessons in addition to those enumerated, which the\r\nCrusade must teach to the people; I would strongly emphasize the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"That human life, as the flower and fruit of the planet--each individual\r\nbeing a microcosm of the macrocosm--must always be held as the most\r\nsacred and the most precious of all things. Because it is the object and\r\npurpose, the beginning, the expression, the commandment and the\r\nfulfillment of the law.\r\n\r\n\"That the law of life and the law of progress, are complements of each\r\nother. Like twin sisters, they act as a bond between the systems of the\r\nuniverse; they embrace all things, from an atom to the Infinite!\r\n\r\n\"That activity, is the expression of life! Necessity and glory, are the\r\ntwo poles of human activity; its inspiration and its motor power!\r\n\r\n\"It is the evident purpose of natural law, that the activity of man\r\nshall unceasingly produce for all, an abundance of the necessities,\r\ncomforts and luxuries of life.\r\n\r\n\"Ignorance, is the giant who bars the pathway of progress! Labor from\r\nnecessity, reigns as a rule, in all ages of ignorance! Misery and\r\npoverty, are its children!\r\n\r\n\"Labor for glory, marks the age of enlightened progress, where all may\r\nhave an opportunity to express individuality, through their handiwork;\r\nto taste the great joy, that comes with the consciousness of\r\nparticipation in spontaneous, unselfish, intelligent activity, which\r\nshall insure the reign of perpetual peace and plenty. In this, man's\r\nconquest over matter, becomes the true glory of labor! In the variety of\r\nself-chosen, self-directed, co-operative, productive labor, is found\r\nlife's greatest blessing.\r\n\r\n\"Organized, unselfish co-operation, will teach the people to appreciate\r\nthe dignity, and the true nobility of labor. From it, they will learn\r\nthat labor, however simple or insignificant, is far nobler than any kind\r\nof enervating idleness; no matter how much that idleness may be gilded\r\nby the varnish of honor! Godin says: 'A day's work well done, is worth\r\nmore than a whole existence of inactivity!'\r\n\r\n\"Labor develops the possibilities of life! It is the effective\r\ninstrument which makes possible the progress of nations, the\r\nemancipation of peoples! The labor of passing ages has evolved a fund of\r\nideas, best adapted to guide humanity towards a true interpretation of\r\nthe object and purpose of human life.\r\n\r\n\"Labor will cease to be a burden, when man comprehends its true mission.\r\nStripped of its drudgery, released from the harness of toil and the spur\r\nof necessity, the brightness of the blessing of labor shines forth\r\nresplendent. In the halo of this radiant truth, can anyone be guilty of\r\na blasphemy, which degrades labor to the penalty of a punishment.\r\n\r\n\"The question of politics is intimately associated with the question of\r\nlabor. The science of politics, is the science of life. Government, is\r\nits expression. Self-government by the individual, is its keynote. The\r\nstudy of this science should be pursued by all classes, with the\r\nenthusiasm born of a religious zeal. A few of its most important\r\nprinciples may be found embodied in the following propositions. If we\r\nwish to be able to take an interest in moral life; we must first satisfy\r\nthe demands of physical life. If we wish to practice justice, we must\r\nfirst learn the law of Right and Duty; that is, in striving to satisfy\r\nour own material wants, we must learn how to protect the rights of\r\nothers. We must remember, that they too are toiling for the same\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\"In order to protect the welfare of each political unit, these\r\nprinciples must form the basis of all scientific politics. In the social\r\nunits evolved by co-operative life, these conditions are embodied and\r\nexpressed. In them, we shall find the basis upon which to build a grand,\r\nsocial, industrial and political organization. An organization, which\r\nshall truly represent Liberty and Justice; which, in its expression as\r\na whole, shall be the government of the New Republic!\r\n\r\n\"Co-operation is the foe of despotism! Associated, intelligent,\r\npolitical co-operation, is the educator which shall teach the people,\r\nthat a true republic cannot exist until, in the minds of its leaders,\r\nevery vestige of the spirit of despotism has been cast out.\r\n\r\n\"In the accomplishment of this great political work, faith in the\r\ndestiny of this republic, its people, and its mission, is to prove a\r\nmost important factor. To endow a people with faith, is to multiply\r\ntheir strength tenfold! Faith, reinforced by knowledge, is an\r\nirresistible force, against which naught can prevail! Hence, it becomes\r\nimperative, that in each school and kindergarten of the republic, its\r\nchildren should be taught in broad outlines, the vastness of its\r\nterritory, and the magnitude of its natural resources.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot too strongly emphasize the necessity for this important part\r\nof the political education of children! As the future guardians and law\r\nmakers of the republic, its children should acquire a thorough knowledge\r\nof the widely diversified characteristics of each geographical\r\nsub-division. This, they must accomplish, before they can be prepared to\r\nappreciate the overshadowing significance, of its past, present, and\r\nfuture destiny.\r\n\r\n\"The kindergarten offers perfect conditions, for the introduction of a\r\nprimary course of this political instruction. By using a large outline\r\nmap, showing the geographical and geological formation, the mineral\r\ndeposits, the extent or area of timbered and agricultural lands, the\r\nmanufacturing centers, the principal wagon-roads and lines of\r\ntransportation, the natural trade centers, the population, the schools,\r\nthe chief officers, and the well known political leaders of each\r\nsub-division; a series of intellectual excursions could be so arranged,\r\nand made so interesting to the children, that they would soon master\r\nthese statistics, as identified with every State and Territory in the\r\nRepublic. Having finished the subdivisions, attention could then be\r\ngiven to a much larger map of the United States, on which the States and\r\nTerritories on a smaller scale, would show the same statistics. From\r\nthis map, the study of the political statistics of the States and\r\nTerritories, by groups, could then be commenced.\r\n\r\n\"A comparative study of the groups, would be full of interest for the\r\nchildren, and would offer a great number of delightful surprises. The\r\nsix groups in natural order, should be classified as follows: The New\r\nEngland, the Middle, the Southern States; the States of the great basin\r\nof the Mississippi Valley, including the imperial State of Texas; the\r\nRocky Mountain States, and the States of the Pacific Slope, including\r\nthat remarkable, and only partially explored Territory, Alaska.\r\n\r\n\"From these group studies, the children may learn many object lessons,\r\nwhich might demonstrate to them, the natural supremacy of this republic,\r\nover other nations. I may mention the following, as noteworthy: The\r\nGreat Lakes of the Middle West; with a coast line of more than three\r\nthousand miles in length; with an interstate commerce which exceeds in\r\ntonnage, the combined shipping trade of France and Germany. The\r\nmarvelous capacity of the great agricultural States of the Mississippi\r\nValley to become the granary of the world; to furnish its entire food\r\nsupply, of bread, beef and pork. The imperial State of Texas, with its\r\nwealth of wheat, cane, corn, cotton and cattle; with a domain so wide,\r\nthat it equals in extent, that of Great Britain, European Turkey,\r\nSwitzerland, Denmark and Portugal. Again, passing to the uttermost\r\nregions of the Great Northwest, we should find the mammoth Territory of\r\nAlaska, rich in its unexplored forests, mineral deposits and golden\r\nsands; with a picturesque coast line of fabulous extent, stretching away\r\nto the North far beyond the Arctic Circle, indented by a multitude of\r\nromantic bays and inlets, where jutting crags, bold promontories of\r\nbasaltic rock, countless islands, sparkling water and shining glaciers,\r\nfill the measure of beauty and grandeur.\r\n\r\n\"Thus educated, the future guardians of the political welfare of the\r\nrepublic, would understand the natural wants of its widely separated\r\nsub-divisions; they would fully appreciate the significance of its\r\ndestiny as a nation. They would always be loyal to the demands of that\r\ndestiny, which should be commensurate with its inexhaustable resources,\r\nwith the magnitude of its domain. A domain so immense, that when\r\ncompared with the countries of the Old World, without counting island\r\npossessions, or the Territory of Alaska, it exceeds in extent, the\r\ncombined areas of China proper, Japan, Austria, Germany, France, Spain,\r\nPortugal, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,\r\nSwitzerland, Great Britain, and European Turkey. With the hearts of its\r\nvoters inspired by such patriotic teachings, the Republic must endure;\r\nmust fulfill its prophetic destiny! Naught can prevail against it! Not\r\neven the selfish schemes of a corrupt oligarchy; no matter how boldly\r\nthey plan or how many billions of capital they may control!\r\n\r\n\"In teaching these things, my children; also in enlarging and perfecting\r\nthe work of the Crusade, I can promise you the support and co-operation\r\nof the spirit world. The broad outlines, which I have given, will\r\nsuggest the more complete details of the work, which I now leave in your\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\n\"That thought alone, Mr. Fenwick,\" said Fillmore, \"ought to prove a\r\ntower of strength to us. May we not make that co-operation more\r\neffective, by a closer study of the conditions that prevail, and of the\r\nlaws which govern spirit life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Later on my son, that will be advisable. But just at present, it is of\r\nthe utmost importance, that every effort should be made to improve the\r\nsocial, industrial, mental and physical condition of mortals, as the\r\nnecessary foundation for true spiritual growth.\r\n\r\n\"Mental growth must precede the spiritual. Power exercised by the mind\r\nover the body, in moulding physical structure, multiplies the power of\r\nthe spirit acting on matter, again reacting on both mind and body.\r\nConsciousness, is spiritual life. To enlarge the sphere of\r\nconsciousness, is to add to spiritual growth. Evolution, is nature's\r\neffort towards progression. The new spiritual era, which began with the\r\nlast half of the nineteenth century, was marked by a dawning\r\nconsciousness in the mind of man, that he might become a self-directing\r\nfactor in his own evolution. This consciousness in turn, became the\r\nstarting point of spiritual evolution on the mortal plane of existence.\r\nThe last, having been made possible by the first.\r\n\r\n\"Reasoning from the premises stated, we must logically conclude that the\r\nembodiment of more mind, of better mind, is a matter of the utmost\r\nimportance to the whole human race. As body and brain are working parts\r\nof the mind, its machinery of expression; it is equally important, that\r\nboth mind and body should be perfected together. Hence, the necessity\r\nfor better social conditions, more financial independence, less labor,\r\nmore leisure, longer life and larger brain capacity; and finally, as the\r\ncrowning requirement, to be well born! To banish poverty, is to make\r\nthese things possible.\r\n\r\n\"Before a proper conception of the spiritual world can be entertained by\r\nmortals, their minds, by the aid of the sciences, must have acquired\r\nsuch knowledge of their environments, as shall satisfy the requirements\r\nof spiritual evolution. Every item of real knowledge thus gained, is\r\njust so much added preparation towards the understanding of the\r\nspiritual; towards a harmonious interblending, and co-operation of the\r\ntwo worlds. In accordance with the law of progression, truth, to the\r\never changing stages of consciousness, is relative. In order to\r\nillustrate the relativity of truth, and the magnitude of the domain of\r\nknowledge in the mortal state, which must be conquered before\r\nconsciousness can be extended beyond the confines of the spiritual; let\r\nus consider the following, somewhat approximate postulates.\r\n\r\n\"Let us suppose, that the life of the planet, Earth, embraces all forms\r\nof life; each individual life pulsating in harmony with the great mother\r\nheart of the planet.\r\n\r\n\"Let us suppose, that spirits, both embodied and disembodied, incarnate\r\nand excarnate, considered as a mass, may act as the terrurgic spiritual\r\nbody and brain of the planet; subjective and responsive to the\r\ninspiration and guidance of the universal cosmic mind, acting from the\r\ncosmic center.\r\n\r\n\"Let us suppose, that the material world, with the atom as its smallest\r\nunit, is the medium of mortal existence. Again, that the impalpable\r\nether of the interstellar spaces, is the medium of existence for the\r\nspiritual world. And again, as a measure of the fineness of ether, that\r\nthe difference between an ether particle and an atom, should be as wide\r\nas the difference between the atom and the planet.\r\n\r\n\"Considering these posits as a basis for comparing life in the two\r\nrealms, we at once perceive that life, organized to correspond with the\r\ncoarse meshes of the material plane of existence, can be permeated,\r\nfilled and quickened, by organized spiritual life, without disturbing\r\nthe unity of either organization. The interblending of spirit and\r\nmatter, is accomplished. The mystery of the dual existence of soul and\r\nbody, is explained. The soul in the body, yet, not of the body! The\r\npermanent and the enduring, mated with the changing and the ephemeral!\r\nThe cell life of the physical, with the soul life of the eternal!\r\n\r\n\"In comparing the two states of existence, the physical with the\r\nspiritual, we find the horizon of consciousness in the former, is\r\nvaguely defined and very much limited; while in the latter, it is\r\nsharply defined and widely extended. The more we study and compare, the\r\nmore readily we understand, that space, duration, size, minuteness,\r\nsolidity and porosity, are all relative terms which depend for their\r\nsignificance entirely on the standpoint of consciousness. So apparent is\r\nthis fact, that we soon learn how impossible it is for the mortal mind\r\nto understand, even the more simple elements of spirit life, until the\r\ndual or spiritual mind, with its consciousness, has grown and unfolded\r\nto the required extent. Hence, growth of consciousness, is growth of\r\nspirit; the spirit which molds and controls matter.\r\n\r\n\"Self-conscious consciousness, is the immortal ego! As a part of the\r\nprogressive, all inclusive, spiritual life of the planet, it takes part\r\nin the evolution and progression of the mass. This mass, in the\r\nfulfillment of the purpose of existence, is subjective and responsive to\r\ncosmic law, and to cosmic inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"In these postulates, we have the key which unlocks the mystery of life.\r\nWe catch a glimpse of its true meaning, purpose, glory and grandeur.\r\nThey raise the theory and practice of human progress to a question of\r\nthe first magnitude; to a science of life, which demands the attention\r\nof every student. The school of human life, lies at the base of the\r\ncuriculum of knowledge. It becomes the foundation of spiritual progress,\r\nas well. Hence, the importance of rightly cultivating the mind, of\r\nextending its consciousness to the uttermost limits of human capacity.\r\n\r\n\"Selfishness and despotism, are frowning barriers across the pathway of\r\nhuman progress. They thrive by war. War, is the foe of spirituality, the\r\nmother of murder! War must be abolished, before man can hope for true\r\nspiritual evolution! It is the fortunate destiny of this republic, to\r\nlead the race in a crusade against it; to open the way for its final\r\nabolition. It is to be the province of the Crusade to teach the people,\r\nthat war has been the scourge of humanity since the beginning of the\r\nhistorical era; the greatest crime ever perpetrated against the\r\nsacredness of human life! Peace, multiplies the products of labor.\r\nLabor, is the genius of life! War, destroys the laborer and his product.\r\nWar is the genius of death! War, is a symbol of barbarism; it is both\r\nthe throne and the refuge of despotism. For the purpose of maintaining\r\ndespotism, people for centuries have been subjected to the hard\r\nconditions of unremitting toil, that they might endure the fatigues of\r\nwar without a murmur. For the same reason, despots have kept the masses\r\nin ignorance, lest they should discover the true quality of justice; the\r\nmoral law, which condemns both despotism and war; lest they should come\r\nto realize all the horrors of the most outrageous crime possible to the\r\nconception of human reason; the crime of war! War is such an\r\noverwhelming calamity, that it is almost impossible to estimate the ruin\r\nand the destruction which it has wrought! If the millions of lives and\r\nthe billions of treasure spent in the world's wars, had been employed in\r\nprotecting the people, in generating, rearing, sustaining and developing\r\nthem to the highest attainable point, this earth would now witness a\r\nsocial millennium; where peace and prosperity, high culture and\r\nharmonious brotherhood, would reign supreme!\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice, that I am permitted to prophesy its downfall! Long before\r\nthe close of the twentieth century, standing armies will disappear; war\r\nwill be at an end; the angel of peace will spread her white wings over\r\nall the nations of the earth! This Crusade, is the beginning of the end!\r\nFor the encouragement of our Crusaders, I will indicate two causes,\r\nacting from opposite directions, which will serve to hasten war's\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\n\"First: The competitive system, for centuries, has been war's chief\r\nrecruiting office. Under its reign, in the fierce struggle for\r\nexistence, it has kept up a perpetual warfare between man and man;\r\nalways the stronger against the weaker. When vanquished, the weaker as a\r\nlast resort, could and did, enlist as a soldier. Thanks to the\r\nco-operative farm, spread broadcast by the Crusade; the early\r\nsubstitution of the co-operative, for the competitive system, will make\r\nthe weak strong; make them financially independent! Soldiering as a\r\ntrade, is made possible by poverty! Whenever a people are emancipated\r\nfrom the cringing slavery of want, naturally averse to being\r\nslaughtered, they will rise en masse, and refuse to be apprenticed to\r\nthe brutal trade of killing their kind. Thus it will happen, that armies\r\nwill melt away and disappear, for the want of fighting men!\r\n\r\n\"Second: Strange as it may appear, the inventors of mighty engines of\r\nwar, of terrible explosives, of deadly missiles, each in turn, more\r\nhorribly destructive than the others; are all envoys of peace; that\r\nsweet peace, which shall bring rest, renewed energy, and swift progress,\r\nto all classes. Through the multiplied and combined efforts of these\r\ninventors, the bloody and barbarous art of war, is fast becoming so\r\nsuicidal, and so financially disastrous to the nations of the earth who\r\nhave the misfortune to engage in it; that such as wish to preserve a\r\nnational existence, must do so by making haste to ally themselves with\r\nthe friends of universal peace, through international arbitration.\r\n\r\n\"Under such circumstances, the nations of the earth, ground between the\r\ninexorable, upper and lower millstones of the first and second cause,\r\nacting under pressure of self-preservation, will, with one accord, join\r\nin covenanting for a total disarmament, and a perpetual peace. All\r\nhail, the glad day!\r\n\r\n\"Then, will dawn man's era of true spiritual evolution! Then, will the\r\ntrue object and purpose of life, be understood! Then, will the\r\nsacredness of human life, be rightly conceived, appreciated, maintained\r\nand respected! Then, wholesale murder, no longer sanctioned by man-made\r\nlaws, it will be possible to banish the spirit of murder from the life\r\nof the individual! Then, the lesser crimes, the demons of despotic\r\nselfishness, greed, cruelty, and lust for power, which now clog progress\r\nand prevent the realization of a practical brotherhood for humanity, can\r\nbe shaken off and rendered harmless!\r\n\r\n\"Then, the emancipated legions of toilers, will rise to a true\r\nunderstanding of the blessing of labor as the real expression of life;\r\nthat the glory of labor, is man's conquest over matter; that food,\r\nshelter, raiment, and sustenance for body, mind and soul, are the\r\nessential elements of life; a natural equipment for the conquest! Then,\r\nit will be the province of a natural religion to teach the people how to\r\nhelp themselves! how to master the great problem of physical life, by\r\nattaining the greatest perfection in feeding, clothing, housing,\r\neducating, and spiritualizing humanity!\r\n\r\n\"Then, the solidarity of the spiritual welfare of mankind, will equal\r\nthat of the physical! Then, the measure of spiritual progress achieved\r\nby the mass, will be the measure of progress attained by its weakest\r\nunit! Then, will come perfect co-operation, between the spiritual and\r\nthe physical! Then, will come the reign of liberty and justice, the\r\nguardian spirits of a true republic! Then, will come the social, the\r\nindustrial, and the spiritual millennium! Then, the barriers of\r\nselfishness will have been burned away; the two worlds will be united;\r\nin the new atmosphere of brotherly love, spirit and mortal may\r\nharmoniously walk, talk, and work together for the perfection of the\r\nrace!\r\n\r\n\"Then, the great armies of the world, no longer in the guise of\r\norganized barbarism, or a tax on the industries of the nations, will be\r\nconverted into armies of peace, engaged in the production of real\r\nwealth! Then, the heretofore undreamed of store of public wealth, will,\r\nin its proper distribution, give to all mankind, the acme of universal\r\neducation, civilization and happiness!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn leaders of a progressive age; filled with the inspiration of one\r\ngreat purpose in life; at all times, equal to the demands of the hour;\r\nhand in hand, with hearts united by the bonds of a supreme love; nobly\r\nunselfish, and spiritually refined; generous, handsome, accomplished;\r\nwealthy, eloquent and magnetic; Fillmore and Fern, our hero and heroine,\r\nwere everywhere recognized as a commanding force in the social and\r\npolitical world. A force which quickly overcame all opposing obstacles.\r\nThey were so much interested, and so absorbed in the ever increasing\r\nsuccess of the Crusade, that the happy months and years flew swiftly by.\r\nTheir devotion to each other, was a potent charm which begat in the\r\nhearts of a legion of admiring followers, an intense loyalty to them,\r\nand to the banner of the Crusade, which had led them to so many\r\nvictories in the cause of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe second decade of the century was throbbing with the birth of\r\nepoch-making events. The astrological forces seemed in conjunction with\r\nplanetary evolution. The time was ripe for the incoming wave of a new\r\nsocial era. The spirit of progress was brooding in the air; stirring in\r\nthe hearts of the people, who hailed the Crusaders as blessed evangels\r\nof the new life, for which they had yearned and prayed so many years.\r\nThe gospel of the new life, was the gospel of co-operative labor. The\r\nwonderful strength and effectiveness of the co-operative farm movement,\r\nto lift the laborer from conditions of ignorance and poverty, to those\r\nof financial independence, comfort and refinement; was practically\r\ndemonstrated, a thousand times over. To the people, each demonstration\r\nwas an ever growing source of astonishment and delight. The enthusiasm\r\naroused, burning with the fires of a religious zeal, irresistibly drew\r\nthem into the ranks of this powerful organization. With rapidly\r\nincreasing numbers, it swept over the land with the force and fury of a\r\ngreat tidal wave! In its track, on the ruins of the competitive system,\r\nthere was established, the reign of co-operative peace and plenty, the\r\nsocial and political millennium.\r\n\r\nAmong the leaders of the Crusade, assembled at Washington, George and\r\nGertrude Gerrish were especially prominent. To them was assigned the\r\ntask of organizing the lecturing or missionary bureau of the Crusade;\r\nits trained force of traveling educators. The good work accomplished by\r\nthis force, was another well earned tribute to their extraordinary skill\r\nas organizers. As well fitted for the responsible duties; George Gaylord\r\nand Honora Eloise Houghton, having become inseparable friends, engaged\r\nlovers, and finally a well-mated, conjugal couple; were placed in\r\ncharge of the traveling educators on the Pacific Slope. So eloquently\r\nand effectively did they labor in this wide field, that throughout its\r\nlength and breadth, they became very popular, winning hosts of friends\r\nfor themselves and the cause.\r\n\r\nSolaris Farm and village, the working center of the movement, soon\r\ndoubled many times, its territory and population. It became an important\r\nmanufacturing center, which made an ideal home for the National\r\nCo-operative Farm School; a normal school, which every year graduated\r\nteachers by the score. The history of Solaris as the initial farm made\r\nit so famous, that thousands of enthusiastic co-operators annually visit\r\nit. It is the business of the reception committee appointed by the\r\nnormal school, to receive, entertain and instruct these visitors.\r\n\r\nGilbert Gerrish, true to his arisen sweetheart, and to his own peculiar\r\npurpose in life; declined to leave Solaris, with his parents. Indeed, he\r\nwas so universally beloved by its young people, that they could not, and\r\nwould not give him up! To the visiting stranger, he seems by far the\r\nmost popular and the most highly honored young man in the village. This\r\ndistinguished consideration, he has rightfully and honestly earned.\r\nHappy himself, in generously using his rare gifts for making other\r\npeople happy!\r\n\r\nThus endeth the story of Solaris Farm. May its purposes haunt the minds\r\nof its readers, like the memories of some prophetic dream, which may not\r\nbe obliterated, which can not be forgotten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA FEW POINTERS FROM THE PEN OF THE REVIEWER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolaris Farm is the title of a new book \"with a purpose.\" In fact it is\r\na book with many purposes. While the author writes intelligently and\r\nforcefully upon stirpiculture, education, invention, hygiene,\r\nsanitation, moral, physical and mental growth and culture, and injects\r\nmany new, beautiful and practical thoughts into each of these subjects,\r\nhis chief theme is unselfish co-operation, his chief purpose is to\r\nexhibit the benefits, moral, physical, social and financial, that will\r\nbe showered upon the human family when they become wise enough to cease\r\ncompeting with each other, and progressive enough to begin co-operating.\r\n\r\nThe story is the logical development of the following situation:\r\n\r\nFern Fenwick, an heiress to a vast estate, had promised her father\r\nbefore his death to use a good share of the Fenwick millions in\r\nbettering the condition of the race. Her first experiment is a\r\nco-operative farm of about five thousand acres, whereon about two\r\nhundred and fifty families settle and work out the many problems which\r\nthe author desires to discuss.\r\n\r\nIn all of these operations she has the able assistance of Fillmore\r\nFlagg, a farmer's son, who, having seen his father and dozens of his old\r\nneighbors crushed in spirit and broken in fortune by the resistless\r\ntrend of events under the competitive system with all its waste of\r\nmisdirected energy, has become disgusted with the meager results of farm\r\nwork and having by great energy obtained a practical education has\r\ndetermined to do something for the alleviation of the miseries of a\r\ncompetition crushed society.\r\n\r\nHe meets Fern Fenwick and is by her employed to superintend the\r\nco-operative farm.\r\n\r\nA very pretty little love story, which the author has told with pleasant\r\nhumor, is the result of their meeting, but the weightier themes with\r\nwhich the book is filled are likely to more fully engross the attention\r\nof the reader.\r\n\r\nCo-operative ventures have usually been founded upon some \"ism,\" and\r\nwere held together by its religious or other influence. In the Solaris\r\nFarm colony a very comprehensive scheme of insurance against accident,\r\npoverty, sickness and old age is the binding principle. The premium is\r\nthe profit which the co-operators collectively make by producing what\r\nthey want (or by buying at wholesale what they cannot produce) and\r\nselling the same to themselves individually at regular market rates. The\r\nexcellence of their wares attract many purchasers from the outside and\r\nthe profits resulting therefrom also tend to swell the insurance fund of\r\nthe co-operators.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of business, and manufacturing are carried on by the\r\nco-operators in addition to farming. Co-operative thinking solves the\r\nknottiest problems for the colony, invention flourishes and, once\r\nstarted, money flows into their coffer at a fairly satisfactory rate.\r\n\r\nCo-operation is the key-word, the essence, the very soul of Solaris\r\nFarm. All the successes achieved by the characters that people the book\r\nare the results of co-operative working, thinking and saving. Every\r\nstockholder lends a hand, and lo! the hours of labor are short and\r\ndelightful; when a disagreeable task must be done, co-operative thinking\r\ninvents a machine which does the work better than a man could do it; the\r\ndignity of toil is established on a sure foundation, and the statement\r\nthat \"muscular effort is a mental demonstration,\" is verified.\r\n\r\n\"Will it pay?\" is sometimes called \"the American question.\" In Solaris\r\nFarm the author has successfully undertaken to present an unselfishness\r\nthat will pay--not in the fairy gold of a far-off Heaven, but in the\r\ncoin of the realm, here and now. Leisure for study and recreation;\r\nbooks, pictures, objects of beauty and art; better health; longer life;\r\nthe society of delightful people none of whom are competing for the\r\nlion's share, but all of whom are co-operating for the benefit of the\r\ncommunity; absence of the fear of poverty; certainty of support in\r\nsickness and old age;--all these and thousands of other comforts are\r\nsome of the certain wages of unselfishness.\r\n\r\nA feature of Solaris Farm which will commend itself to every well-wisher\r\nof the race is the high estimate which the author places on humanity.\r\nMan, he says, is the flower and fruit of the planet, its highest and\r\nbest product. To arrive at the highest point possible in his evolution,\r\nit is necessary for him to be well born and this necessitates happy,\r\nhealthy, prosperous parents and proper environments. To follow out this\r\nidea to its logical conclusion would be to repeat the author's\r\narguments, for he has completely filled the field. The reader is\r\nreferred to the story for the facts proving that unselfish co-operation\r\nwill furnish everything needful for the complete unfoldment of the now\r\nalmost dormant possibilities of human nature.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of happiness and the hope of its ultimate possession is the\r\nmotor which induces all human endeavor. No act is ever done except in\r\nobedience to this law of our nature which compels us to seek pleasure.\r\nIgnorance of the nature of true pleasure has led us after many a\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp, and our unlearned race has soiled its garments many\r\ntimes in error, commonly called \"sin.\" \"Sinful pleasures,\" against which\r\nour parents, the clergy, and all moral philosophers have warned us, do\r\nnot exist. _There is no pleasure in sin._ Our race beliefs, based upon\r\nuntruth and ignorance, have bequeathed us a heritage of appetites,\r\npassions and desires which are wrong, and hurtful when gratified.\r\n\r\nAmong the most hurtful of race beliefs is the fixed idea that labor is a\r\ncurse. Nothing could be further from the truth. As has been aptly said:\r\n\"Art is the expression of a man's joy in his work.\" Labor--muscular\r\nexertion, having a definite productive object--is a blessing and a joy\r\nwhen the worker is in love with his work. Work is a curse only under the\r\ncompetitive system, which by its wasteful methods extends the hours of\r\ntoil beyond the limits of endurance, robs the worker of the full\r\nbenefits of his labor and gives him no time for self-improvement. The\r\nexperience of the stockholders of Solaris Farm shows how the ancient\r\ncurse was removed by unselfish co-operation, and labor crowned with the\r\ndignity that is its due.\r\n\r\nWhile Solaris Farm was not intended as a propaganda of spiritualism,\r\nthat cult has been introduced with considerable dramatic effect for two\r\napparent reasons. The first and least important of these reasons is to\r\ncater to the ever-growing taste of the reading public for the occult;\r\nbut the second reason is peculiar to the book. In discussing man as the\r\nmost valuable product of the planet, and the relation which the soul\r\nbears to the body, it became necessary to approach the subject from the\r\nview-point of one who is in nowise affected by the petty altercations,\r\njealousies and strifes of the world; one who knows by experience all the\r\nhardships of life and its many temptations, but who has also progressed\r\nbeyond the sphere of their influence. The most natural and obvious way\r\nof obtaining this coveted point of observation was to let the spirit of\r\nsuch a noble character as Fennimore Fenwick speak from the fulness of\r\nhis experience, both as mortal and spirit, of the needs of the race, the\r\ncurse of competition, the value of proper environmental conditions for\r\nperfect motherhood, pre-natal education and adequate training of mind\r\nand body, such as may not be secured even by the most wealthy in the\r\npresent condition of society, but which would be the heritage of every\r\nindividual in a co-operative community. The utterances of Fennimore\r\nFenwick rank with the best thought on these subjects and no person can\r\nread them without having implanted in his breast a higher regard for his\r\nrace, and a greater solicitude for the material and spiritual unfoldment\r\nof humanity.\r\n\r\nFor many years, orators and agitators have vied with each other in\r\nproclaiming that capital and labor were the two factors of financial\r\nsuccess. They were and still are mistaken. Within the pages of Solaris\r\nFarm the reader is given the true formula, which may be algebraically\r\nstated thus: \"Capital + Labor + Brains = Financial Success.\" Financial\r\nSuccess, however is not the complete product of these factors when\r\nselfishness, greed and wasteful competition are eliminated from the\r\nequation by the substitution of unselfish co-operation. The happy result\r\nof the experiment at Solaris Farm must convince the reader of the\r\ncorrectness of the formula and the value of the substitution.\r\n\r\nIn considering the broad field covered by this attractive book; its wide\r\ndeparture from the mission of the ordinary novel, its probable use as a\r\ntext-book of advanced thought on true socialism, progressive\r\nco-operation, a new order of political economy and the ways and means of\r\nmaking colony life desirable, successfully coherent, self-supporting and\r\npractically delightful; the price of Solaris Farm (50 cts, in paper\r\ncovers, $1.25 in cloth binding) will commend itself to the purchaser as\r\nnot only reasonably moderate, but also if he be an interested reader,\r\nwith business intentions, that the large end of the bargain is very much\r\nin his favor.\r\n\r\nSolaris Farm was written by Captain Milan C. Edson, whose military title\r\nwas earned during the great Civil War. He was a farmer and the son of a\r\nfarmer. He enlisted as a private soldier and without influence rose to a\r\ncaptaincy by merit and bravery alone. He is a profound thinker, a lover\r\nof his race and has given many years to the study of social and\r\npolitical questions. It has been his desire to found a community where\r\nhis ideas of true success might be wrought out, as an object lesson to\r\nthe world, of the advantages of unselfishness. This pleasure having been\r\ndenied him, he has incorporated his leading ideas in Solaris Farm, in\r\nthe hope that some one more fortunate than himself may be able to\r\nreceive the blessings which must inevitably flow from such a noble life.",
