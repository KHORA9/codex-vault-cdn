The inscription is dated in\r\nthe early part of this century (about 1810), but the name of him who was\r\nthus immortalized has faded like the date of his death from my memory,\r\nwhile the deed for which he was distinguished, and which was recorded\r\nupon his tombstone, remains clear. \"He built the famous bridge over the\r\nCharles River in this town,\" says the record. The Charles River is here\r\na small stream, about twenty to thirty feet wide, and the bridge was a\r\nsimple wooden structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LYMAN VIADUCT.]\r\n\r\nDoubtless in its day this structure was considered an engineering feat\r\nworthy of such posthumous immortality as is gained by an epitaph, and\r\nafforded such convenience for transportation as was needed by the\r\ncommercial activity of that era. From that time, however, to this, the\r\nchanges which have occurred in our commercial and industrial methods are\r\nso fully indicated by the changes of our manner and method of\r\nbridge-building that it will not be a loss of time to investigate the\r\npresent condition of our abilities in this most useful branch of\r\nengineering skill.\r\n\r\nIn the usual archaeological classification of eras the Stone Age\r\nprecedes that of Iron, and in the history of bridge-building the same\r\nsequence has been preserved. Though the knowledge of working iron was\r\nacquired by many nations at a pre-historic period, yet in quite modern\r\ntimes--within this century, even--the invention of new processes and the\r\nexperience gained of new methods have so completely revolutionized this\r\nbranch of industry, and given us such a mastery over this material,\r\nenabling us to apply it to such new uses, that for the future the real\r\nAge of Iron will date from the present century.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the arch as a method of construction with stone or\r\nbrick--both of them materials aptly fitted for resistance under\r\npressure, but of comparatively no tensile strength--enabled the Romans\r\nto surpass all nations that had preceded them in the course of history\r\nin building bridges. The bridge across the Danube, erected by\r\nApollodorus, the architect of Trajan's Column, was the largest bridge\r\nbuilt by the Romans. It was more than three hundred feet in height,\r\ncomposed of twenty-one arches resting upon twenty piers, and was about\r\neight hundred feet in length. It was after a few years destroyed by the\r\nemperor Adrian, lest it should afford a means of passage to the\r\nbarbarians, and its ruins are still to be seen in Lower Hungary.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of railroads bridge-building became even a greater\r\nnecessity than it had ever been before, and the use of iron has enabled\r\nengineers to grapple with and overcome difficulties which only fifty\r\nyears ago would have been considered hopelessly insurmountable. In this\r\nmodern use of iron advantage is taken of its great tensile strength, and\r\nmany iron bridges, over which enormous trains of heavily-loaded cars\r\npass hourly, look as though they were spun from gossamer threads, and\r\nyet are stronger than any structure of wood or stone would be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLAST-FURNACES.]\r\n\r\nAnother great advantage of an iron bridge over one constructed of wood\r\nor stone is the greater ease with which it can, in every part of it, be\r\nconstantly observed, and every failing part replaced. Whatever material\r\nmay be used, every edifice is always subject to the slow disintegrating\r\ninfluence of time and the elements. In every such edifice as a bridge,\r\nuse is a process of constant weakening, which, if not as constantly\r\nguarded against, must inevitably, in time, lead to its destruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUMPING ORE AND COAL INTO BLAST-FURNACES.]\r\n\r\nIn a wooden or stone bridge a beam affected by dry rot or a stone\r\nweakened by the effects of frost may lie hidden from the inspection of\r\neven the most vigilant observer until, when the process has gone far\r\nenough, the bridge suddenly gives way under a not unusual strain, and\r\ndeath and disaster shock the community into a sense of the inherent\r\ndefects of these materials for such structures.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the railroad has brought about also another change\r\nin the bridge-building of modern times, compared with that of all the\r\nages which have preceded this nineteenth century. The chief bridges of\r\nancient times were built as great public conveniences upon thoroughways\r\nover which there was a large amount of travel, and consequently were\r\nnear the cities or commercial centres which attracted such travel, and\r\nwere therefore placed where they were seen by great numbers. Now,\r\nhowever, the connection between the chief commercial centres is made by\r\nthe railroads, and these penetrate immense distances, through\r\ncomparatively unsettled districts, in order to bring about the needed\r\ndistribution; and in consequence many of the great railroad bridges are\r\nbuilt in the most unfrequented spots, and are unseen by the numerous\r\npassengers who traverse them, unconscious that they are thus easily\r\npassing over specimens of engineering skill which surpass, as objects of\r\nintelligent interest, many of the sights they may be traveling to see.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELEVATOR.]\r\n\r\nThe various processes by which the iron is prepared to be used in\r\nbridge-building are many of them as new as is the use of this material\r\nfor this purpose, and it will not be amiss to spend a few moments in\r\nexamining them before presenting to our readers illustrations of some of\r\nthe most remarkable structures of this kind. Taking a train by the\r\nReading Railroad from Philadelphia, we arrive, in about an hour, at\r\nPhoenixville, in the Schuylkill Valley, where the Phoenix Iron-and\r\nBridge-works are situated. In this establishment we can follow the iron\r\nfrom its original condition of ore to a finished bridge, and it is the\r\nonly establishment in this country, and most probably in the world,\r\nwhere this can be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ENGINE-ROOM.]\r\n\r\nThese works were established in 1790. In 1827 they came into the\r\npossession of the late David Reeves, who by his energy and enterprise\r\nincreased their capacity to meet the growing demands of the time, until\r\nthey reached their present extent, employing constantly over fifteen\r\nhundred hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUNNING METAL INTO PIGS.]\r\n\r\nThe first process is melting the ore in the blast-furnace. Here the ore,\r\nwith coal and a flux of limestone, is piled in and subjected to the heat\r\nof the fires, driven by a hot blast and kept burning night and day. The\r\niron, as it becomes melted, flows to the bottom of the furnace, and is\r\ndrawn off below in a glowing stream. Into the top of the blast-furnaces\r\nthe ore and coal are dumped, having been raised to the top by an\r\nelevator worked by a blast of air. It is curious to notice how slowly\r\nthe experience was gathered from which has re suited the ability to\r\nwork iron as it is done here. Though even at the first settlement of\r\nthis country the forests of England had been so much thinned by their\r\nconsumption in the form of charcoal in her iron industry as to make a\r\ndemand for timber from this country a flourishing trade for the new\r\nsettlers, yet it was not until 1612 that a patent was granted to Simon\r\nSturtevant for smelting iron by the consumption of bituminous coal.\r\nAnother patent for the same invention was granted to John Ravenson the\r\nnext year, and in 1619 another to Lord Dudley; yet the process did not\r\ncome into general use until nearly a hundred years later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARRYING THE IRON BALLS.]\r\n\r\nThe blast for the furnace is driven by two enormous engines, each of\r\nthree hundred horse-power. The blast used here is, as we have said, a\r\nhot one, the air being heated by the consumption of the gases evolved\r\nfrom the material itself. The gradual steps by which these successive\r\nmodifications were introduced is an evidence of how slowly industrial\r\nprocesses have been perfected by the collective experience of\r\ngenerations, and shows us how much we of the present day owe to our\r\npredecessors. From the earliest times, as among the native smiths of\r\nAfrica to-day, the blast of a bellows has been used in working iron to\r\nincrease the heat of the combustion by a more plentiful supply of\r\noxygen. The blast-furnace is supposed to have been first used in\r\nBelgium, and to have been introduced into England in 1558. Next came the\r\nuse of bituminous coal, urged with a blast of cold air. But it was not\r\nuntil 1829 that Neilson, an Englishman, conceived the idea of heating\r\nthe air of the blast, and carried it out at the Muirkirk furnaces. In\r\nthat year he obtained a patent for this process, and found that he could\r\nfrom the same quantity of fuel make three times as much iron. His patent\r\nmade him very rich: in one single case of infringement he received a\r\ncheque for damages for one hundred and fifty thousand pounds. In his\r\nmethod, however, he used an extra fire for heating the air of his blast.\r\nIn 1837 the idea of heating the air for the blast by the gases generated\r\nin the process was first practically introduced by M. Faber Dufour at\r\nWasseralfingen in the kingdom of Würtemberg.\r\n\r\nIn this country, charcoal was at first used universally for smelting\r\niron, anthracite coal being considered unfit for the purpose. In 1820 an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to use it was made at Mauch Chunk. In 1833,\r\nFrederick W. Geisenhainer of Schuylkill obtained a patent for the use of\r\nthe hot blast with anthracite, and in 1835 produced the first iron made\r\nwith this process. In 1841, C.E. Detmold adapted the consumption of the\r\ngases produced by the smelting to the use of anthracite; and since then\r\nit has become quite general, and has caused an almost incalculable\r\nsaving to the community in the price of iron.\r\n\r\nThe view of the engines which pump the blast will give an idea of the\r\nimmense power which the Phoenix company has at command. Twice every day\r\nthe furnace is tapped, and the stream of liquid iron flows out into\r\nmoulds formed in the sand, making the iron into pigs--so called from a\r\nfancied resemblance to the form of these animals. This makes the first\r\nprocess, and in many smelting-establishments this is all that is done,\r\nthe iron in this form being sold and entering into the general\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nThe next process is \"boiling,\" which is a modification of \"puddling,\"\r\nand is generally used in the best iron-works in this country. The\r\nprocess of puddling was invented by Henry Cort, an Englishman, and\r\npatented by him in 1783 and 1784 as a new process for \"shingling,\r\nwelding and manufacturing iron and steel into bars, plates and rods of\r\npurer quality and in larger quantity than heretofore, by a more\r\neffectual application of fire and machinery.\" For this invention Cort\r\nhas been called \"the father of the iron-trade of the British nation,\"\r\nand it is estimated that his invention has, during this century, given\r\nemployment to six millions of persons, and increased the wealth of Great\r\nBritain by three thousand millions of dollars. In his experiments for\r\nperfecting his process Mr. Cort spent his fortune, and though it proved\r\nso valuable, he died poor, having been involved by the government in a\r\nlawsuit concerning his patent which beggared him. Six years before his\r\ndeath, the government, as an acknowledgment of their wrong, granted him\r\na yearly pension of a thousand dollars, and at his death this miserly\r\nrecompense was reduced to his widow to six hundred and twenty-five\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROTARY SQUEEZER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILING-FURNACE.]\r\n\r\nWhen iron is simply melted and run into any mould, its texture is\r\ngranular, and it is so brittle as to be quite unreliable for any use\r\nrequiring much tensile strength. The process of puddling consisted in\r\nstirring the molten iron run out in a puddle, and had the effect of so\r\nchanging its atomic arrangement as to render the process of rolling it\r\nmore efficacious. The process of boiling is considered an improvement\r\nupon this. The boiling-furnace is an oven heated to an intense heat by a\r\nfire urged with a blast. The cast-iron sides are double, and a constant\r\ncirculation of water is kept passing through the chamber thus made, in\r\norder to preserve the structure from fusion by the heat. The inside is\r\nlined with fire-brick covered with metallic ore and slag over the bottom\r\nand sides, and then, the oven being charged with the pigs of iron, the\r\nheat is let on. The pigs melt, and the oven is filled with molten iron.\r\nThe puddler constantly stirs this mass with a bar let through a hole in\r\nthe door, until the iron boils up, or \"ferments,\" as it is called. This\r\nfermentation is caused by the combustion of a portion of the carbon in\r\nthe iron, and as soon as the excess of this is consumed, the cinders\r\nand slag sink to the bottom of the oven, leaving the semi-fluid mass on\r\nthe top. Stirring this about, the puddler forms it into balls of such a\r\nsize as he can conveniently handle, which are taken out and carried on\r\nlittle cars, made to receive them, to \"the squeezer.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROLLS.]\r\n\r\nTo carry on this process properly requires great skill and judgment in\r\nthe puddler. The heat necessarily generated by the operation is so great\r\nthat very few persons have the physical endurance to stand it. So great\r\nis it that the clothes upon the person frequently catch fire. Such a\r\nstrain upon the physical powers naturally leads those subjected to it to\r\nindulge in excesses. The perspiration which flows from the puddlers in\r\nstreams while engaged in their work is caused by the natural effort of\r\ntheir bodies to preserve themselves from injury by keeping their normal\r\ntemperature. Such a consumption of the fluids of the body causes great\r\nthirst, and the exhaustion of the labor, both bodily and mental, leads\r\noften to the excessive use of stimulants. In fact, the work is too\r\nlaborious. Its conditions are such that no one should be subjected to\r\nthem. The necessity, however, for judgment, experience and skill on the\r\npart of the operator has up to this time prevented the introduction of\r\nmachinery to take the place of human labor in this process. The\r\nsuccessful substitution in modern times of machines for performing\r\nvarious operations which formerly seemed to require the intelligence and\r\ndexterity of a living being for their execution, justifies the\r\nexpectation that the study now being given to the organization of\r\nindustry will lead to the invention of machines which will obviate the\r\nnecessity for human suffering in the process of puddling. Such a\r\nconsummation would be an advantage to all classes concerned. The\r\nattempts which have been made in this direction have not as yet proved\r\nentirely successful.\r\n\r\nIn the squeezer the glowing ball of white-hot iron is placed, and forced\r\nwith a rotary motion through a spiral passage, the diameter of which is\r\nconstantly diminishing. The effect of this operation is to squeeze all\r\nthe slag and cinder out of the ball, and force the iron to assume the\r\nshape of a short thick cylinder, called \"a bloom.\" This process was\r\nformerly performed by striking the ball of iron repeatedly with a\r\ntilt-hammer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLD SAW.]\r\n\r\nThe bloom is now re-heated and subjected to the process of rolling. \"The\r\nrolls\" are heavy cylinders of cast iron placed almost in contact, and\r\nrevolving rapidly by steam-power. The bloom is caught between these\r\nrollers, and passed backward and forward until it is pressed into a flat\r\nbar, averaging from four to six inches in width, and about an inch and a\r\nhalf thick. These bars are then cut into short lengths, piled, heated\r\nagain in a furnace, and re-rolled. After going through this process they\r\nform the bar iron of commerce. From the iron reduced into this form the\r\nvarious parts used in the construction of iron bridges are made by being\r\nrolled into shape, the rolls through which the various parts pass having\r\ngrooves of the form it is desired to give to the pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOT SAW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIVETING A COLUMN.]\r\n\r\nThese rolls, when they are driven by steam, obtain this generally from a\r\nboiler placed over the heating-or puddling-furnace, and heated by the\r\nwaste gases from the furnace. This arrangement was first made by John\r\nGriffin, the superintendent of the Phoenix Iron-works, under whose\r\ndirection the first rolled iron beams over nine inches thick that were\r\never made were produced at these works. The process of rolling toughens\r\nthe iron, seeming to draw out its fibres; and iron that has been twice\r\nrolled is considered fit for ordinary uses. For the various parts of a\r\nbridge, however, where great toughness and tensile strength are\r\nnecessary, as well as uniformity of texture, the iron is rolled a third\r\ntime. The bars are therefore cut again into pieces, piled, re-heated and\r\nrolled again. A bar of iron which has been rolled twice is formed from\r\na pile of fourteen separate pieces of iron that have been rolled only\r\nonce, or \"muck bar,\" as it is called; while the thrice-rolled bar is\r\nmade from a pile of eight separate pieces of double-rolled iron. If,\r\ntherefore, one of the original pieces of iron has any flaw or defect, it\r\nwill form only a hundred and twelfth part of the thrice-rolled bar. The\r\nuniformity of texture and the toughness of the bars which have been\r\nthrice rolled are so great that they may be twisted, cold, into a knot\r\nwithout showing any signs of fracture. The bars of iron, whether hot or\r\ncold, are sawn to the various required lengths by the hot or cold saws\r\nshown in the illustrations, which revolve with great rapidity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FURNACE AND HYDRAULIC DIE.]\r\n\r\nFor the columns intended to sustain the compressive thrust of heavy\r\nweights a form is used in this establishment of their own design, and to\r\nwhich the name of the \"Phoenix column\" has been given. They are tubes\r\nmade from four or from eight sections rolled in the usual way and\r\nriveted together at their flanges. When necessary, such columns are\r\njoined together by cast-iron joint-blocks, with circular tenons which\r\nfit into the hollows of each tube.\r\n\r\nTo join two bars to resist a strain of tension, links or eye-bars are\r\nused from three to six inches wide, and as long as may be needed. At\r\neach end is an enlargement with a hole to receive a pin. In this way any\r\nnumber of bars can be joined together, and the result of numerous\r\nexperiments made at this establishment has shown that under sufficient\r\nstrain they will part as often in the body of the bar as at the joint.\r\nThe heads upon these bars are made by a process known as die-forging.\r\nThe bar is heated to a white heat, and under a die worked by hydraulic\r\npressure the head is shaped and the hole struck at one operation. This\r\nmethod of joining by pins is much more reliable than welding. The pins\r\nare made of cold-rolled shafting, and fit to a nicety.\r\n\r\nThe general view of the machine-shop, which covers more than an acre of\r\nground, shows the various machines and tools by which iron is planed,\r\nturned, drilled and handled as though it were one of the softest of\r\nmaterials. Such a machine-shop is one of the wonders of this century.\r\nMost of the operations performed there, and all of the tools with which\r\nthey are done, are due entirely to modern invention, many of them within\r\nthe last ten years. By means of this application of machines great\r\naccuracy of work is obtained, and each part of an iron bridge can be\r\nexactly duplicated if necessary. This method of construction is entirely\r\nAmerican, the English still building their iron bridges mostly with\r\nhand-labor. In consequence also of this method of working, American iron\r\nbridges, despite the higher price of our iron, can successfully compete\r\nin Canada with bridges of English or Belgian construction. The American\r\niron bridges are lighter than those of other nations, but their absolute\r\nstrength is as great, since the weight which is saved is all dead\r\nweight, and not necessary to the solidity of the structure. The same\r\ndifference is displayed here that is seen in our carriages with their\r\nslender wheels, compared with the lumbering, heavy wagons of European\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF MACHINE-SHOP.]\r\n\r\nBefore any practical work upon the construction of a bridge is begun the\r\ndata and specifications are made, and a plan of the structure is drawn,\r\nwhether it is for a railroad or for ordinary travel, whether for a\r\ndouble or single track, whether the train is to pass on top or below,\r\nand so on. The calculations and plans are then made for the use of such\r\ndimensions of iron that the strain upon any part of the structure shall\r\nnot exceed a certain maximum, usually fixed at ten thousand pounds to\r\nthe square inch. As the weight of the iron is known, and its tensile\r\nstrength is estimated at sixty thousand pounds per square inch, this\r\nestimate, which is technically called \"a factor of safety\" of six, is a\r\nvery safe one. In other words, the bridge is planned and so constructed\r\nthat in supporting its own weight, together with any load of locomotives\r\nor cars which can be placed upon it, it shall not be subjected to a\r\nstrain over one-sixth of its estimated strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW RIVER BRIDGE ON ITS STAGING.]\r\n\r\nAfter the plan is made, working drawings are prepared and the process of\r\nmanufacture commences. The eye-bars, when made, are tested in a\r\ntesting-machine at double the strain which by any possibility they can\r\nbe put to in the bridge itself. The elasticity of the iron is such that\r\nafter being submitted to a tension of about thirty thousand pounds to\r\nthe square inch it will return to its original dimensions; while it is\r\nso tough that the bars, as large as two inches in diameter, can be bent\r\ndouble, when cold, without showing any signs of fracture. Having stood\r\nthese tests, the parts of the bridge are considered fit to be used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE AT ALBANY.]\r\n\r\nWhen completed the parts are put together--or \"assembled,\" as the\r\ntechnical phrase is--in order to see that they are right in length, etc.\r\nThen they are marked with letters or numbers, according to the working\r\nplan, and shipped to the spot where the bridge is to be permanently\r\nerected. Before the erection can be begun, however, a staging or\r\nscaffolding of wood, strong enough to support the iron structure until\r\nit is finished, has to be raised on the spot. When the bridge is a large\r\none this staging is of necessity an important and costly structure. An\r\nillustration on another page shows the staging erected for the support\r\nof the New River bridge in West Virginia, on the line of the Chesapeake\r\nand Ohio Railway, near a romantic spot known as Hawksnest. About two\r\nhundred yards below this bridge is a waterfall, and while the staging\r\nwas still in use for its construction, the river, which is very\r\ntreacherous, suddenly rose about twenty feet in a few hours, and became\r\na roaring torrent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA SALLE BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nThe method of making all the parts of a bridge to fit exactly, and\r\nsecuring the ties by pins, is peculiarly American. The plan still\r\nfollowed in Europe is that of using rivets, which makes the erection of\r\na bridge take much more time, and cost, consequently, much more. A\r\nriveted lattice bridge one hundred and sixty feet in span would require\r\nten or twelve days for its erection, while one of the Phoenixville\r\nbridges of this size has been erected in eight and a half hours.\r\n\r\nThe view of the Albany bridge will show the style which is technically\r\ncalled a \"through\" bridge, having the track at the level of the lower\r\nchords. This view of the bridge is taken from the west side of the\r\nHudson, near the Delavan House in Albany. The curved portion crosses the\r\nAlbany basin, or outlet of the Erie Canal, and consists of seven spans\r\nof seventy-three feet each, one of sixty-three, and one of one hundred\r\nand ten. That part of the bridge which crosses the river consists of\r\nfour spans of one hundred and eighty-five feet each, and a draw two\r\nhundred and seventy-four feet wide. The iron-work in this bridge cost\r\nabout three hundred and twenty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe bridge over the Illinois River at La Salle, on the Illinois Central\r\nRailroad, shows the style of bridge technically called a \"deck\" bridge,\r\nin which the train is on the top. This bridge consists of eighteen spans\r\nof one hundred and sixty feet each, and cost one hundred and eighty\r\nthousand dollars. The bridge over the Kennebec River, on the line of the\r\nMaine Central Railroad, at Augusta, Maine, is another instance of a\r\n\"through\" bridge. It cost seventy-five thousand dollars, has five spans\r\nof one hundred and eighty-five feet each, and was built to replace a\r\nwooden deck bridge which was carried away by a freshet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE AT AUGUSTA, MAINE.]\r\n\r\nThe bridge on the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad which crosses the\r\nSaco River is a very general type of a through railway bridge. It\r\nconsists of two spans of one hundred and eighty-five feet each, and cost\r\ntwenty thousand dollars. The New River bridge in West Virginia consists\r\nof two spans of two hundred and fifty feet each, and two others of\r\nseventy-five feet each. Its cost was about seventy thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Lyman Viaduct, on the Connecticut Air-line Railway, at East Hampton,\r\nConnecticut, is one hundred and thirty-five feet high and eleven\r\nthousand feet long.\r\n\r\nThese specimens will show the general character of the iron bridges\r\nerected in this country. When iron was first used in constructions of\r\nthis kind, cast iron was employed, but its brittleness and unreliability\r\nhave led to its rejection for the main portions of bridges. Experience\r\nhas also led the best iron bridge-builders of America to quite generally\r\nemploy girders with parallel top and bottom members, vertical posts\r\n(except at the ends, where they are made inclined toward the centre of\r\nthe span), and tie-rods inclined at nearly forty-five degrees. This\r\nform takes the least material for the required strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SACO BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nThe safety of a bridge depends quite as much upon the design and\r\nproportions of its details and connections as upon its general shape.\r\nThe strain which will compress or extend the ties, chords and other\r\nparts can be calculated with mathematical exactness. But the strains\r\ncoming upon the connections are very often indeterminate, and no\r\nmathematical formula has yet been found for them. They are like the\r\nstrains which come upon the wheels, axles and moving parts of\r\ncarriages, cars and machinery. Yet experience and judgment have led the\r\nbest builders to a singular uniformity in their treatment of these\r\nparts. Each bridge has been an experiment, the lessons of which have\r\nbeen studied and turned to the best effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOENIX WORKS.]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that iron bridges can be made perfectly safe. Their\r\nmargin is greater than that of the boiler, the axles or the rail. To\r\nmake them safe, European governments depend upon rigid rules, and\r\ncareful inspection to see that they are carried out. In this country\r\ngovernment inspection is not relied on with such certainty, and the\r\nspirit of our institutions leads us to depend more upon the action of\r\nself-interest and the inherent trustworthiness of mankind when indulged\r\nwith freedom of action. Though at times this confidence may seem vain,\r\nand \"rings\" in industrial pursuits, as in politics, appear to corrupt\r\nthe honesty which forms the very foundation of freedom, yet their\r\ninfluence is but temporary, and as soon as the best public sentiment\r\nbecomes convinced of the need for their removal their influence is\r\ndestroyed. Such evils are necessary incidents of our transitional\r\nmovement toward an industrial, social and political organization in\r\nwhich the best intelligence and the most trustworthy honesty shall\r\ncontrol these interests for the best advantage of society at large. In\r\nthe mean time, the best security for the safety of iron bridges is to be\r\nfound in the self-interest of the railway corporations, who certainly do\r\nnot desire to waste their money or to render themselves liable to\r\ndamages from the breaking of their bridges, and who consequently will\r\nemploy for such constructions those whose reputation has been fairly\r\nearned, and whose character is such that reliance can be placed in the\r\nhonesty of their work. Experience has given the world the knowledge\r\nneeded to build bridges of iron which shall in all possible\r\ncontingencies be safe, and there is no excuse for a penny-wise and\r\npound-foolish policy when it leads to disaster.\r\n\r\nEDWARD ROWLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEARCHING FOR THE QUININE-PLANT IN PERU.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND PAPER.\r\n\r\nThe crystal peaks of the Andes were behind our explorers: before, were\r\ntheir eastward-stretching spurs and their eastward-falling rivers. On\r\nthe mountain-flanks, as the last landmark of Christian civilization,\r\nnestled the village of Marcapata, whose square, thatched belfry faded\r\ngradually from sight, reminding the travelers of the ghostly\r\nministrations of the padre and the secular protection of the gobernador.\r\nNeither priest nor edile would they encounter until their return to the\r\nsame church-tower. Their patron, Don Juan Sanz de Santo Domingo, was\r\nalready picking his way along the snowy defiles of the mountains to\r\nattain again his luxurious home in Cuzco. Behind the adventurers lay\r\ncompanionship and society--represented by the dubious orgies of the\r\nHouse of Austria--and the security of civil government--represented by\r\nthe mortal ennui of a Peruvian city. Before them lay difficulties and\r\nperhaps dangers, but also at least variety, novelty and possible wealth.\r\n\r\nColonel Perez, Marcoy and the examinador retained their horses, and a\r\ncouple of the mozos their mules, the remainder of the beasts being kept\r\nat livery in Marcapata, and the muleteers volunteering to accompany the\r\ntroupe as far as Chile-Chile: at this point the bridle-path came to an\r\nend, and the gentlemen would have to dismount, accompanying thenceforth\r\ntheir peons on a literal \"footing\" of equality.\r\n\r\nTwo torrents which fall in perpendicular cataracts from the mountains,\r\nthe Kellunu (\"yellow water\") and the Cca-chi (\"salt\"), run together at\r\nthe distance of a league from their place of precipitation. They enclose\r\nin their approach the hill on which Marcapata is perched, and they form\r\nby their confluence the considerable river which our travelers were\r\nabout to trace, and which is called by the Indians Cconi (\"warm\"), but\r\non the Spanish maps is termed the river of Marcapata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE FIRST FORD OF THE CCONI WAS PASSED JUST OUTSIDE THE\r\nTOWN.\"]\r\n\r\nThe first ford of the Cconi was passed just outside the town, at a point\r\nwhere the right bank of the river, growing steeper and steeper, became\r\nimpracticable, and necessitated a crossing to the left. The ford allowed\r\nthe peons to stagger through at mid-leg on the uneven pavement afforded\r\nby the large pebbles of the bed. At this point the valley of the Cconi\r\nwas seen stretching indefinitely outward toward the east, enclosed in\r\ntwo chains of conical peaks: their regular forms, running into each\r\nother at the middle of their height, clothed with interminable forests\r\nand bathed with light, melted regularly away into the perspective.\r\nIndian huts buried in gardens of the white lily which had seemed so\r\nbeautiful in the chapel of Lauramarca, hedges of aloe menacing the\r\nintruder with their millions of steely-looking swords, slender bamboos\r\ndaintily rocking themselves over the water, and enormous curtains of\r\ncreepers hanging from the hillsides and waving to the wind in vast\r\nbreadths of green, were the decorations of this Peruvian paradise.\r\n\r\nThe pretty lilies gradually disappeared, and the thatched cabins became\r\nmore and more sparse, when from one of the latter, at a hundred paces\r\nfrom the caravan, issued a human figure. The man struck an attitude in\r\nthe pathway of the travelers, his carbine on his shoulder, his fist on\r\nhis hip and his nose saucily turned up in the air. Neither his\r\nMetamora-like posture nor his dress inspired confidence.\r\n\r\n\"He is evidently waiting for us,\" remarked Colonel Perez, an heroic yet\r\nprudent personage: \"fortunately, it is broad day. I would not grant an\r\ninterview to such a _salteador_ (brigand) alone at night and in a\r\ndesert.\"\r\n\r\nThe salteador wore a low broad felt, on whose ample brim the rain and\r\nsun had sketched a variety of vague designs. A gray sack buttoned to the\r\nthroat and confined by a leathern belt, and trowsers of the same stuffed\r\ninto his long coarse woolen stockings, completed his costume. He was\r\nshod, like an Indian, in _ojotas_, or sandals cut out of raw leather and\r\nlaced to his legs with thongs. Two ox-horns hanging at his side\r\ncontained his ammunition, and a light haversack was slung over his back.\r\nThis mozo, who at a distance would have passed for a man of forty,\r\nappeared on examination to be under twenty-two years of age. It was\r\nlikewise observable on a nearer view that his skin was brown and clear\r\nlike a chestnut, and that his lively eye, perfect teeth and air of\r\ndecision were calculated to please an Indian girl of his vicinity. To\r\ncomplete his rehabilitation in the eyes of the party, his introductory\r\naddress was delivered with the grace of a Spanish cavalier.\r\n\r\n\"The gentlemen,\" said he, gracefully getting rid of his superabundant\r\nhat, \"will voluntarily excuse me for having waited so long with my\r\nrespects and offers of service. I should have gone to meet them at\r\nMarcapata, but my uncle the gobernador forbade me to do so for fear of\r\ndispleasing the priest. Gentlemen, I am Juan the nephew of Aragon. It is\r\nby the advice of my uncle that I have come to place myself in your way,\r\nand ask if you will admit me to your company as mozo-assistant and\r\ninterpreter.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel, whose antipathy to the salteador did not yield on a closer\r\nacquaintance, roughly asked the youth what he meant by his assurance.\r\nMr. Marcoy, however, was disposed to temporize.\r\n\r\n\"If you are Juan the nephew of Aragon,\" said he, \"you must have already\r\nlearned from your uncle that we have engaged an interpreter, Pepe Garcia\r\nof Chile-Chile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely what he told me, señor,\" replied the young man; \"but, for my\r\npart, I thought that if one interpreter would be useful to these\r\ngentlemen on their journey, two interpreters would be a good deal\r\nbetter, on account of the fact that we walk better with two legs than\r\nwith one: that is the reason I have intercepted you, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nThis opinion made everybody laugh, and as Juan considered it his\r\nprivilege to laugh five times louder than any one, a quasi engagement\r\nresulted from this sudden harmony of temper. Colonel Perez shrugged his\r\nshoulders: Marcoy, as literary man, took down the name of the new-comer.\r\nThe nephew of Aragon was so delighted that he gave vent to a little cry\r\nof pleasure, at the same time cutting a pirouette. This harmless caper\r\nallowed the party to detect; tied to his haversack, the local banjo, or\r\n_charango_, an instrument which the Paganinis of the country make for\r\nthemselves out of half a calabash and the unfeeling bowels of the cat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"GENTLEMEN, I AM JUAN THE NEPHEW OF ARAGON.\"]\r\n\r\nThe priest, who had recommended Pepe Garcia, had made mention of that\r\nperson's fine voice, with which the church of Marcapata was edified\r\nevery Sunday. The gobernador, while putting in a word for his nephew,\r\nand particularizing the beauty of his execution on the guitar, had\r\ninsinuated doubts of the baritone favored by the padre. Happy land,\r\nwhose disputes are like the disputes of an opera company, and where\r\npeople are recommended for business on the strength of their musical\r\nexecution!\r\n\r\nAragon quickly understood that his friend in the expedition was not\r\nColonel Perez, who had insultingly dubbed him the Second Fiddle (or\r\nCharango). He attached himself therefore with the fidelity of a spaniel\r\nto Mr. Marcoy, walking alongside and resting his arm on the pommel of\r\nhis saddle. After an hour's traverse of a comparatively desert plateau\r\ncalled the Pedregal, covered with rocks and smelling of the\r\npatchouli-scented flowers of the mimosa, Aragon pointed out the straw\r\nsheds and grassy plaza of Chile-Chile. This rustic metropolis is not\r\nindicated on many maps, but for the travelers it had a special\r\nimportance, bearing upon the inca history and etymological roots of\r\nPeru, for it was the residence of their interpreter-in-chief, Pepe\r\nGarcia.\r\n\r\nIntroduced by the latter, our explorers made a kind of triumphal entry\r\ninto the village. The old Indian women dropped their spinning, the naked\r\nchildren ceased to play with the pigs and began to play with the\r\ngarments and equipage of the visitors, and a couple of blind men, who\r\nwere leading each other, remarked that they were glad to see them.\r\n\r\nGarcia the polyglot, radiant with importance, lost no time in dragging\r\nhis guests toward his own residence, a large straw thatch surmounting\r\nwalls of open-work, which took the fancy of the travelers from the\r\nsingular trophy attached above the door. This trophy was composed of the\r\nheads of bucks and rams, with those of the fox and the ounce, where the\r\nshrunken skin displayed the pointed _sierra_ of the teeth, while the\r\nhorns of oxen and goats, set end to end around the borders, formed dark\r\nand rigid festoons: all vacancies were filled up with the forms of bats,\r\nspread-eagled and nailed fast, from the smallest variety to the large,\r\nman-attacking _vespertilio_. As a contrast to this exterior decoration,\r\nthe inside was severely simple: it was even a little bare. A partition\r\nof bamboo divided the hut into kitchen and bed-room, and that was all.\r\nInto the latter of these apartments Pepe Garcia dragged the saddles of\r\nhis guests, and in the former his two twin-daughters, melancholy little\r\nhalf-breeds in ragged petticoats, assisted their father to prepare for\r\nthe wanderers a hunter's supper.\r\n\r\nEvery moment, in a dark corner or behind the backs of the company,\r\nGarcia was observed caressing these little girls in secret. Being\r\nrallied on his tenderness, he observed that the twins were the double\r\npledge of a union \"longer happy than was usual,\" and the only survivors\r\nof fifteen darlings whom he had given to the world in the various\r\ncountries whither his wandering fortunes had led him. Still explaining\r\nand multiplying his caresses, the man of family went on with his\r\nexertions as cook, and in due time announced the meal.\r\n\r\nThis festival consisted of sweet potatoes baked in the ashes, and steaks\r\nof bear broiled over the coals. The latter viand was repulsed with\r\nhorror by the colonel, who in the effeminacy of a city life at Cuzeo had\r\nnever tasted anything more outlandish than monkey. Seeing his companions\r\neating without scruple, however, the valiant warrior extended his tin\r\nplate with a silent gesture of application. The first mouthful appeared\r\nhard to swallow, but at the second, looking round at his\r\nfellow-travelers with surprise and joy, he gave up his prejudices, and\r\nmarked off the remainder of his steak with wonderful swiftness. Standing\r\nbehind his boarders, Pepe Garcia had been watching the play of jaws and\r\nexpressions of face with some uneasiness, but when the colonel gave in\r\nhis adhesion his doubts were removed, and he smiled agreeably, flattered\r\nin his double quality of hunter and cook.\r\n\r\nThe beds of the gentlemen-travelers were spread side by side in the\r\nadjoining room, and Garcia gravely assured them that they would sleep\r\nlike the Three Wise Men of the East. Unable to see any personal analogy\r\nbetween themselves and the ancient Gaspar, Melchior and Balthazar, the\r\ntired cavaliers turned in without remarking on the subject. They paused\r\na moment, however, before taking up their candle, to set forth to Garcia\r\nin full the circumstances and nature of Juan of Aragon's engagement.\r\nThis explanation, which the close quarters of the troop had made\r\nimpossible during the journey, was received in excellent part by the\r\ninterpreter-in-chief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE STRAW SHEDS AND GRASSY PLAZA OF CHILE-CHILE.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am not at all jealous of Aragon,\" said he, \"and the gentlemen\r\nhave done very well in taking him along. He will be of great use. He is\r\na bright, capable mozo, who would walk twenty miles on his hands to gain\r\na piastre. As an interpreter, I think he is almost as good as I am.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus smoothed away all grounds of rivalry, the colonel, the\r\nexaminador and Marcoy took possession of their sleeping-room. Here, long\r\nafter their light was put out, they watched the scene going on in the\r\napartment they had just left, whose interior, illuminated by a candle\r\nand a lingering fire, was perfectly visible through the partition of\r\nbamboo. The dark-skinned girls, on their knees in a corner, were\r\ngathering together the shirts and stockings destined for the parental\r\ntraveling-bag. Garcia, for his part, was occupied in cleaning with a bit\r\nof rag a portentous, long-barreled carbine, apparently dating back to\r\nthe time of Pizarro, which he had been exhibiting during the day as his\r\nhunting rifle, and which he intended to carry along with him.\r\n\r\nThe sleep under the thatched roof of Pepe Garcia, though somewhat less\r\nsound than that of the Three Magi in their tomb at Cologne, lasted until\r\na ray of the morning sun had penetrated the open-work walls of the hut.\r\nThe colonel rapidly dressed himself, and aroused the others. A\r\ndisquieting silence reigned around the modest mansions of Chile-Chile.\r\nThe interpreter was away, Juan of Aragon was away, the muleteers had\r\nreturned, according to instructions received over-night, to Marcapata\r\nwith the animals, and the peons were found dead-drunk behind the mud\r\nwall of the last house in the village.\r\n\r\nAfter three hours of impatient waiting there appeared--not Garcia and\r\nAragon, whose absence was inexplicable, but--the faithful Bolivian\r\nbark-hunters in a body. Not caring to stupefy themselves with the peons,\r\nthey had gone out for a reconnoissance in the environs. Contemplating\r\nthe nodding forms of their comrades, they now let out the discouraging\r\nfact that these tame Indians, madly afraid of their wild brothers the\r\nChunchos, had been fortifying themselves steadily with brandy and chicha\r\nall the way from Marcapata. Disgusted and helpless, Perez and the\r\nexaminador betook themselves to reading tattered newspapers issued at\r\nLima a month before, and Marcoy to his note-book. Suddenly a ferocious\r\nwild-beast cry was heard coming from the woods, and while the Indian\r\nporters tried to run away, and the white men looked at each other with\r\napprehension, Pepe Garcia and Aragon appeared in the distance. Their\r\narms were interlaced in a brother-like manner, they were poising\r\nthemselves with much care on their legs, and they were drunk. Well had\r\nthe elder interpreter said that he was not jealous of Aragon. They\r\nrolled forward toward the party, repeating their outrageous duet, whose\r\nreception by the staring peons appeared to gratify them immensely.\r\n\r\nThe mozo, feeling his secondary position, had enervated himself\r\nslightly--the superior was magisterially tipsy. He wore a remarkable hat\r\nentirely without a brim, and patched all over the top with a lid of\r\nleather. His face, marked up to the eyes with the blue stubble of that\r\nbeard which filled him with pride as a sign of European extraction, was\r\nswollen and hideous with drunkenness. He carried, besides the fearful\r\nblunder-buss of the night before, a belt full of pistols and hatchets. A\r\nshort infantry-sword was banging away at his calves, and two long\r\nox-horns rattled at his waist. The interpreters had been partaking of a\r\nlittle complimentary breakfast with the muleteers in whose care the\r\nanimals had gone off to Marcapata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"CHAUPICHACA WAS MARKED WITH A SQUARE TERMINAL PILLAR.\"]\r\n\r\nA concentration of energy on the part of the chiefs of the expedition\r\nwas required to set in movement this unpromising assemblage. The\r\nexaminador undertook the peons: he rapped them smartly and repeatedly\r\nabout the head and shoulders, until they staggered to their feet and\r\ndeclared that they were a match for whole hordes of Indians: this\r\ncourage, borrowed from the flask, gave strong assurance that at the\r\nfirst alarm from genuine Chunchos they would take to their heels. Mr.\r\nMarcoy, feeling unable to do justice to the case of the nephew, turned\r\nhim over to Perez, whose undisguised dislike made the work of correction\r\nat once grateful and thorough. Marcoy himself confronted the stolid and\r\nsullen Pepe Garcia, insisting upon the example he owed to the Indian\r\nporters and the responsibility of his Caucasian blood. The half-breed\r\nlistened for a minute, his eyes fixed upon the ground: he then shook\r\nhimself, looked an instant at his employer, and planted himself firmly\r\non his legs. Then, determined to prove by a supreme effort that he was\r\nclear-headed and master of his motions, he suddenly drew his sword,\r\nhustled the Indians in a line by two and two, pointed out to Aragon his\r\nposition as rear-guard, and cried with a voice of thunder, \"_Adelante_!\"\r\nThe porters and peons staggered forward, knocking against each other's\r\nelbows and tottering on their stout legs. The three white men,\r\nburdenless, but regretting their horses, walked as they pleased, keeping\r\nthe train in sight. And John the nephew of Aragon's guitar, dangling at\r\nhis back, brought up the rear, with its suggestions of harmony and the\r\namenities of life.\r\n\r\nThe first trait of aboriginal character (after this parenthetical\r\nalacrity at drunkenness) was shown after some hours of marching and the\r\npassage of a dozen streams. The porters, weakened by their drink and the\r\nextreme heat, squatted down on the side of a hill by their own consent\r\nand with a single impulse. With that lamb-like placidity and that\r\nmule-like obstinacy which characterize the antique race of Quechuas,\r\nthey observed to the chief interpreter that they were weary of falling\r\non their backs or their stomachs at every other step, and that they were\r\nresolved to go no farther. Pepe Garcia caused the remark to be repeated\r\nonce more, as if he had not understood it: then, convinced that an\r\nincipient rebellion was brewing, he sprang upon the fellow who happened\r\nto be nearest, haled him up from the ground by the ears, and, shaking\r\nhim vigorously, proceeded to do as much for the rest of the band. In the\r\nflash of an eye, much to their astonishment, they found themselves on\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\nA judicious if not very discriminating award of blows from the sabre\r\nthen followed, causing the Indians to change their resolve of remaining\r\nin that particular spot, and to show a lively determination to get away\r\nfrom it as quickly as possible. Each porter, forgetting his fatigue, and\r\nseeming never to have felt any, began to trot along, no longer languidly\r\nas before, but with a precision of step and a firmness in his round\r\ncalves which surprised and charmed the travelers. Pepe Garcia, much\r\nrefreshed by this exercise of discipline, and perspiring away his\r\nintoxication as he marched, began to give grounds for confidence from\r\nhis steady and authoritative manner. By nightfall the whole troop was in\r\nharmony, and the strangers retired with hopeful hearts to the privacy of\r\nthe hammocks which Juan of Aragon slung amongst the trees on the side of\r\nMount Morayaca.\r\n\r\nNo effect could seem finer, to wanderers from another latitude, than\r\nthis first night-bivouac in the absolute wilderness. The moon, seeming\r\nto race through the clouds, and the camp-fire flashing in the wind,\r\nappeared to give movement and animation to the landscape. The Indians,\r\ngrouped around the flame, seemed like swarthy imps tending the furnace\r\nof some fantastic pandemonium. Meanwhile, amidst the constant murmurs of\r\nthe trees, the nephew of Aragon was heard drawing the notes of some kind\r\nof amorous despair from the hollow of his melodious calabash. The\r\nexaminador and Colonel Perez lulled themselves to sleep with a\r\nconversation about the beauties and beatitudes of their wives, now\r\nplaying the part of Penelopes in their absence. To hear the eulogies of\r\nthe examinador, an angel fallen perpendicularly from heaven could hardly\r\nhave realized the physical and moral qualities of the spouse he had left\r\nin Sorata. The Castilian tongue lent wonderful pomp and magnificence to\r\nthis portrait, and as the metaphors thickened and the superb phrases\r\nlost themselves in hyperbole, one would have thought the lady in\r\nquestion was about to fly back to her native stars on a pair of\r\nresplendent wings. Colonel Perez furnished an equally elaborate\r\ndelineation of his own fair helpmate. As for the wife of Lorenzo, nobody\r\nknew what she was like, and the panegyric from the lips of her faithful\r\nlord rolled on in safety and success. But the personage called by Perez\r\n\"his Theresa\" was a female whom anybody who had passed through the small\r\nshopkeeping quarters of Cuzco might have seen every day, as well as\r\nheard designated by her common nickname (given no one knows why) of\r\nMalignant Quinsy; and, arguing in algebraic fashion from the known to\r\nthe unknown, it was not difficult to be convinced that the poetic\r\nflights of the examinador were equally the work of fond flattery.\r\n\r\nSurprised by a midnight storm, the camp was broken up before the early\r\ndaylight, and our explorers' caravan moved on without breakfast. This\r\nnecessary stop-gap was arranged for at the first pleasant spot on the\r\nroute. An old clearing soon appeared, provided with the welcome\r\naccommodation of an _ajoupa_, or shed built upon four posts. At the\r\ncommand of _Alto alli!_--\"Halt there!\"--uttered by Perez in the tone he\r\nhad formerly used in governing his troops, the whole band stopped as one\r\nperson; the porters dumped their bales with a significant _ugh!_ the\r\nBolivian bark-hunters laid down their axes; and the gentlemen arranged\r\nthemselves around the parallelogram of the hut, attending the\r\ncommissariat developments of Colonel Perez. The site which hazard had so\r\nconveniently offered was named Chaupichaca. It was the scene of an\r\nancient wood-cutting, around which the trunks of the antique forests\r\nshowed themselves in a warm soft light, like the columns of a temple or\r\nthe shafts of a mosque.\r\n\r\nA detail which struck the travelers in arriving was very characteristic\r\nof these lands, filled so full of old traditions and inca customs.\r\nChaupichaca was marked with a square terminal pillar, one of those\r\nboundaries of mud and stones, called _apachectas_, which Peruvian\r\nmasonry lavishes over the country of Manco Capac. A rude cross of sticks\r\nsurmounted this stone altar, on which some pious hand had laid a\r\nnosegay, now dried--signifying, in the language of flowers proper to\r\nmasons and stone-cutters, that the work was finished and left. A little\r\nwater and spirits spared from the travelers' meal gave a slight air of\r\nrestoration to these mysterious offerings, and a couple of splendid\r\nbutterflies, whether attracted by the flowers or the alcoholic perfume,\r\ncommenced to waltz around the bouquet; but the corollas contained no\r\nhoney for their diminutive trunks, and after a slight examination they\r\ndanced contemptuously away.\r\n\r\nAt seven or eight miles' distance another streamlet was reached, named\r\nthe Mamabamba. It is a slender affluent of the Cconi, to be called a\r\nrivulet in any country but South America, but here named a river with\r\nthe same proud effrontery which designates as a _city_ any collection of\r\na dozen huts thrown into the ravine of a mountain. The Mamabamba was\r\ncrossed by an extemporized bridge, constructed on the spot by the\r\ningenuity of Garcia and his men. Strange and incalculable was the\r\nengineering of Pepe Garcia. Sometimes, across one of these\r\ncontinually-occurring streams, he would throw a hastily-felled tree,\r\nover which, glazed as it was by a night's rain or by the humidity of the\r\nforest, he would invite the travelers to pass. Sometimes, to a couple of\r\nlogs rotting on the banks he would nail cross-strips like the rungs of a\r\nladder, and, while the torrent boiled at a distance below, pass jauntily\r\nwith his Indians, more sure-footed than goats. The wider the abyss the\r\nmore insecure the causeway; and the terrible rope-bridges of South\r\nAmerica, or the still more conjectural throw of a line of woven roots,\r\nwould meet the travelers wherever the cleft was so wide as to render\r\ntimbering an inconvenient trouble. Occasionally, on one of these damp\r\nand moss-grown ladders, a peon's foot would slip, and down he would go,\r\nthe load strapped on his back catching him as he was passing through the\r\naperture: then, using his hands to hold on by, he would compose, on the\r\nspur of the moment, a new and original language or telegraphy of the\r\nlegs, _kicking_ for assistance with all his might. Juan of Aragon was\r\nusually the hero to extricate these poor estrays from the false step\r\nthey had taken, the other peons regarding the scene with their tranquil\r\nstolidity. A glass of brandy to the unfortunate would always compose\r\nhis nerves again, and make him hope for a few more accidents of a like\r\nnature and bringing a like consolation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE MAMABAMBA WAS CROSSED BY AN EXTEMPORIZED BRIDGE.\"]\r\n\r\nThe bridge of the Mamabamba conducted the party to a site of the same\r\nname, through an interval of forest where might be counted most of the\r\nvarieties of tree proper to the equatorial highlands. Up to this point\r\nthe vegetation everywhere abounding had not indicated the presence, or\r\neven the vicinage, of the cinchona. The only circumstance which brought\r\nit to the notice of the inexperienced leaders of the expedition would be\r\na halt made from time to time by the Bolivian bark-hunters. The\r\nexaminador and his cascarilleros, touching one tree or another with\r\ntheir hatchets, would exchange remarks full of meaning and\r\nmysteriousness; but when the colonel or Mr. Marcoy came to ask the\r\nsignificance of so many hints and signals, they got the invariable\r\nanswer of Sister Anna to the wife of Bluebeard: \"I see nothing but the\r\nforest turning green and the sun turning red.\" The most practical\r\nreminder of the quest of cinchona which the travelers found was an\r\noccasional _ajoupa_ alone in the wilderness, with a broken pot and a\r\nrusted knife or axe beneath it--witness that some eager searcher had\r\ntraveled the road before themselves. The cascarilleros are very\r\navaricious and very brave, going out alone, setting up a hut in a\r\nprobable-looking spot, and diverging from their head-quarters in every\r\ndirection. If by any accident they get lost or their provisions are\r\ndestroyed, they die of hunger. Doctor Weddell, on one occasion in\r\nBolivia, landed on the beach of a river well shaded with trees. Here he\r\nfound the cabin of a cascarillero, and near it a man stretched out upon\r\nthe ground in the agonies of death. He was nearly naked, and covered\r\nwith myriads of insects, whose stings had hastened his end. On the\r\nleaves which formed the roof of the hut were the remains of the\r\nunfortunate man's clothes, a straw hat and some rags, with a knife, an\r\nearthen pot containing the remains of his last meal, a little maize and\r\ntwo or three _chuñus_. Such is the end to which their hazardous\r\noccupation exposes the bark-collectors--death in the midst of the\r\nforests, far from home; a death without help and without consolation.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after passing the elevated site of San Pedro, and\r\nclambering up the slippery shoulders of the hill called Huaynapata--the\r\ncrossing of half a dozen intervening streamlets going for nothing--that\r\nthe explorers were rewarded with a sight of their Canaan, the\r\nbark-producing region. To attain this summit of Huaynapata, however, the\r\nlittle tributary of Mendoza had to be first got over. This affluent of\r\nthe Cconi, flowing in from the south-south-west, was very sluggish as\r\nfar as it could be seen. Its banks, interrupted by large rocks clothed\r\nwith moss, offered now and then promontories surrounded at the base with\r\na bluish shade. At the end of the vista, a not very extensive one, a\r\nquantity of blocks of sandstone piled together resembled a crumbling\r\nwall. Other blocks were sprinkled over the bed of the stream; and by\r\ntheir aid the examinador and the colonel hopped valiantly over the\r\nMendoza, leaving the peons, who were less afraid of rheumatism and more\r\nin danger of slipping, to ford the current at the depth of their\r\nsuspender-buttons.\r\n\r\nIt was on the top of Huaynapata, while the interpreters built a fire and\r\nprepared for supper a peccary killed upon the road, that Marcoy observed\r\nthe examinador holding with his Bolivians a conversation in the Aymara\r\ndialect, in which could be detected such words as _anaranjada_ and\r\n_morada_. These were the well-known commercial names of two species of\r\ncinchona. The historiographer interrupted their conversation to ask if\r\nanything had yet been discovered.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing yet,\" replied the examinador; \"and this valley of the Cconi\r\nmust be bewitched, for with the course that we have taken we should long\r\nago have discovered what we are after. But this place looks more\r\nfavorable than any we have met. I shall beat up the woods to-morrow with\r\nmy men, and may my patron, Saint Lorenzo, return again to his gridiron\r\nif we do not date our first success in quinine-hunting from this very\r\nhillock of Huaynapata!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE EXAMINADOR AND THE COLONEL HOPPED VALIANTLY OVER THE\r\nMENDOZA.\"]\r\n\r\nThe above style of threatening the saints is thought very efficacious in\r\nall Spanish countries. Whether or not Saint Lawrence really dreaded\r\nanother experience of broiling, at the end of certain hours the\r\nBolivians reappeared, and their chief deposited in the hands of the\r\ncolonel a few green and tender branches. At the joyful shout of Perez,\r\nthe man of letters, who had been occupied in making a sketch, came\r\nrunning up. Two different species of cinchona were the trophy brought\r\nback by Lorenzo, like the olive-leaves in the beak of Noah's dove. One\r\nof these specimens was a variety of the _Carua-carua,_ with large\r\nleaves heavily veined: the other was an individual resembling those\r\nquinquinas which the botanists Ruiz and Pavon have discriminated from\r\nthe cinchonas, to make a separate family called the _Quinquina\r\ncosmibuena._ After all, the discovery was rather an indication than a\r\nconquest of value. The examinador admitted as much, but observed that\r\nthe presence of these baser species always argued the neighborhood of\r\ngenuine quinine-yielding plants near by.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of this first success on the part of the exploration set\r\non foot by Don Juan Sanz de Santo Domingo, we may insert a few words on\r\nthe nature of the wonderful plant toward which its researches were\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the aboriginal inhabitants of Peru, Bolivia and\r\nEcuador were acquainted with the virtues of the cinchona plant as a\r\nfebrifuge. It seems probable, nevertheless, that the Indians of Loxa,\r\ntwo hundred and thirty miles south of Peru, were aware of the qualities\r\nof the bark, for there its use was first made known to Europeans. It was\r\nforty years after the pacification of Peru however, before any\r\ncommunication of the remedial secret was made to the Spaniards. Joseph\r\nde Jussieu reports that in 1600 a Jesuit, who had a fever at Malacotas,\r\nwas cured by Peruvian bark. In 1638 the countess Ana of Chinchon was\r\nsuffering from tertian fever and ague at Lima, whither she had\r\naccompanied the viceroy, her husband. The corregidor of Loxa, Don Juan\r\nLopez de Canizares, sent a parcel of powdered quinquina bark to her\r\nphysician, Juan de Vega, assuring him that it was a sovereign and\r\ninfallible remedy for \"tertiana.\" It was administered to the countess,\r\nwho was sixty-two years of age, and effected a complete cure. This\r\ncountess, returning with her husband to Spain in 1640, brought with her\r\na quantity of the healing bark. Hence it was sometimes called\r\n\"countess's bark\" and \"countess's powder.\" Her famous cure induced\r\nLinnaeus, long after, to name the whole genus of quinine-bearing trees,\r\nin her honor, _Cinchona_. By modern writers the first _h_ has usually\r\nbeen dropped, and the word is now almost invariably spelled in that way,\r\ninstead of the more etymological _Chinchona_. The Jesuits afterward made\r\ngreat and effective use of it in their missionary expeditions, and it\r\nwas a ludicrous result of their patronage that its use should have been\r\nfor a long time opposed by Protestants and favored by Catholics. In\r\n1679, Louis XIV. bought the secret of preparing quinquina from Sir\r\nRobert Talbor, an English doctor, for two thousand louis-d'or, a large\r\npension and a title. Under the Grand Monarch it was used at dessert,\r\nmingled with Spanish wine. The delay of its discovery until the\r\nseventeenth century has probably lost to the world numbers of valuable\r\nlives. Had Alexander the Great, who died of the common remittent fever\r\nof Babylon, been acquainted with cinchona bark, his death would have\r\nbeen averted and the partition of the Macedonian empire indefinitely\r\npostponed. Oliver Cromwell was carried off by an ague, which the\r\nadministration of quinine would easily have cured. The bigotry of\r\nmedical science, even after its efficacy was known and proved, for a\r\nlong time retarded its dissemination. In 1726, La Fontaine, at the\r\ninstance of a lady who owed her life to it, the countess of Bouillon,\r\ncomposed a poem in two cantos to celebrate its virtues; but the\r\nremarkable beauty of the leaves of the cinchona and the delicious\r\nfragrance of its flowers, with allusions to which he might have adorned\r\nhis verses, were still unknown in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe cinchonas under favorable circumstances become large trees: at\r\npresent, however, in any of the explored and exploited regions of their\r\ngrowth, the shoots or suckers of the plants are all that remain.\r\nWherever they abound they form the handsomest foliage of the forest. The\r\nleaves are lanceolate, glossy and vividly green, traversed by rich\r\ncrimson veins: the flowers hang in clustering pellicles, like lilacs, of\r\ndeep rose-color, and fill the vicinity with rich perfume. Nineteen\r\nvarieties of cinchonae have been established by Doctor Weddell. The\r\ncascarilleros of South America divide the species into a category of\r\ncolors, according to the tinge of the bark: there are yellow, red,\r\norange, violet, gray and white cinchonas. The yellow, among which figure\r\nthe _Cinchona calisaya, lancifolia, condaminea, micrantha, pubescens,_\r\netc., are placed in the first rank: the red, orange and gray are less\r\nesteemed. This arrangement is in proportion to the abundance of the\r\nalkaloid _quinine,_ now used in medicine instead of the bark itself.\r\n\r\nThe specimens found by the examinador were carefully wrapped in\r\nblankets, and the march was resumed. After a slippery descent of the\r\nside of Huaynapata and the passage of a considerable number of babbling\r\nstreams--each of which gave new occasion for the colonel to show his\r\ningenuity in getting over dry shod, and so sparing his threatening\r\nrheumatism--the cry of \"Sausipata!\" was uttered by Pepe Garcia. Two neat\r\nmud cabins, each provided with a door furnished with the unusual luxury\r\nof a wooden latch, marked the plantation of Sausipata. The situation was\r\nlevel, and within the enclosing walls of the forest could be seen a\r\nplantation of bananas, a field of sugar-cane, with groves of coffee,\r\norange-orchards and gardens of sweet potato and pineapple. The white\r\nvisitors could not refrain from an exclamation of surprise at the\r\nneatness and civilization of such an Eden in the desert. At this point,\r\nJuan of Aragon, who had been going on ahead, turned around with an air\r\nof splendid welcome, and explained that the farm belonged to his uncle,\r\nthe gobernador of Marcapata, who prayed them to make themselves at home.\r\nIntroducing his guests into the largest of the houses, Juan presented\r\nthem with some fine ripe fruit which he culled from the garden. Colonel\r\nPerez, who never lost occasion to give a sly stab to the mozo, asked, as\r\nhe peeled a banana, if he was duly authorized to dispose so readily of\r\nthe property of his uncle: the youth, without losing a particle of his\r\nmagnificent adolescent courtesy, replied that as nephew and direct heir\r\nof the governor of Marcapata it was a right which he exercised in\r\nanticipation of inheritance; and that just as Pepe Garcia, the\r\ninterpreter-in-chief, had regaled the party in his residence, he, Juan\r\nof Aragon, proposed to do in the family grange of Sausipata.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the examinador, who had pushed forward with his men, returned\r\nwith a couple more specimens of quinquina, which they had discovered\r\nclose by in clambering amongst the forest. Neither had flowers, but the\r\none was recognizable by its flat leaf as the species called by the\r\nIndians _ichu-cascarilla,_ from the grain _ichu_ amongst which it is\r\nusually found at the base of the Cordilleras; and the other, from its\r\nfruit-capsules two inches in length, as the _Cinchona acutifolia_ of\r\nRuiz and Pavon. To moderate the pleasures of this discovery, the\r\nexaminador came up leaning upon the shoulder of his principal assistant,\r\nEusebio, complaining of a frightful headache, and a weakness so extreme\r\nthat he could not put one foot before the other.\r\n\r\nThe sudden illness of their botanist-in-chief cast a gloom upon the\r\nparty, and utterly spoiled the festive intentions of young Aragon.\r\nLorenzo was put to bed, from which retreat, at midnight, his fearful\r\ngroans summoned the colonel to his side. The latter found him tossing\r\nand murmuring, but incapable of uttering a word. His faithful Eusebio,\r\nat the head of the bed, answered for him. The honest fellow feared lest\r\nhis master might have caught again a touch of the old fever which had\r\nformerly attacked him in searching for cascarillas in the environs of\r\nTipoani in Bolivia. These symptoms, recurring in the lower valleys of\r\nthe Cconi, would make it impossible for the brave explorer safely to\r\ncontinue with the party. As the mestizo propounded this inconvenient\r\ntheory, a new burst of groans from the examinador seemed to confirm it.\r\nThe grave news brought all the party to the sick bed. Colonel Perez,\r\nwhom the touching comparison of wives made in the hammocks of Morayaca\r\nhad sensibly attached to Lorenzo, endeavored to feel his pulse; but the\r\npatient, drawing in his hand by a peevish movement, only rolled himself\r\nmore tightly in his blanket, and increased his groans to roars.\r\nPresently, exhausted by so much agony, he fell into a slumber.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the examinador, in a dolorous voice, announced that he\r\nshould be obliged to return to Cuzco. This resolution might have seemed\r\nthe obstinate delirium of the fever but for the mournful and pathetic\r\ncalmness of the victim. Eusebio, he said, should return with him as far\r\nas Chile-Chile, where a conveyance could be had; and he himself would\r\ngive such explicit instructions to the cascarilleros that nothing would\r\nbe lost by his absence to the purposes of the expedition. Yielding to\r\npity and friendship, the colonel gave in his adhesion to the plan, and\r\neven proposed his own hammock as a sort of palanquin, and the loan of a\r\npair of the peons for bearers. They could return with Eusebio to\r\nSausipata, where the party would be obliged to wait for the three. After\r\nsketching out his plan, Colonel Perez looked for approval to Mr. Marcoy,\r\nand received an affirmative nod. The proposition seemed so agreeable to\r\nthe sick man that already an alleviation of his misery appeared to be\r\nsuperinduced. He even smiled intelligently as he rolled into the\r\nhammock. In a very short time he made a sort of theatrical exit, borne\r\nin the hammock like an invalid princess, and fanned with a palm branch\r\nout of the garden by the faithful Eusebio.\r\n\r\n\"Poor devil!\" said Perez as the mournful procession departed: \"who knows\r\nif he will ever see his dear wife at Sorata, or if he will even live to\r\nreach Chile-Chile?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think him in any such danger?\" asked the more suspicious\r\nMarcoy.\r\n\r\n\"Danger! Did you not see his miserable appearance as he left us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw an appearance far from miserable, and therefore I am convinced\r\nthat the man is no more sick than you or I.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing such a heartless heresy the colonel stepped back from his\r\ncomrade with a shocked expression, and asked what had given him such an\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n\"A number of things, of which I need only mention the principal. In the\r\nfirst place, the man's sickness falling on him like a thunder-clap;\r\nnext, his haste in catching back his hand when you tried to feel his\r\npulse; and then his smile, at once happy and mischievous, when you\r\noffered him the peons and he found his stratagem succeeding beyond his\r\nhopes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, now, to think of it!\" said the colonel sadly; \"but what could have\r\nbeen his motive?\"\r\n\r\n\"This gentleman is too delicate to sustain our kind of life,\" suggested\r\nMarcoy. \"He is tired of skinning his hands and legs in our service, and\r\neating peccary, monkey and snails as we do. His Bolivians are perhaps\r\nquite as useful for our service, and while he is rioting at Cuzco we may\r\nbe enriching ourselves with cinchonas.\"\r\n\r\nIn effect, on the return of the peons ten days after, the examinador was\r\nreported to have got quit of his fever shortly after leaving Sausipata,\r\nand to have borne the journey to Chile-Chile remarkably well. He charged\r\nhis men to take back his compliments and the regrets he felt, at not\r\nbeing able to keep with the company.\r\n\r\nNothing detained the band longer at Sausipata. The ten days of hunting,\r\nbotanizing, butterfly-catching and sketching had been an agreeable\r\nrelief, and young Aragon had assumed, with sufficient grace, the task of\r\nattentive host and first player on the charango. The returning porters\r\nhad scarcely enjoyed two hours of repose when the caravan took up its\r\nmarch once more.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the interpreters assumed the head of the command: the Indians\r\nfollowed pellmell. Observing that some of them lingered behind, Mr.\r\nMarcoy had the curiosity to return on his steps. What was his surprise\r\nto find these honest fellows running furiously through the farm, and\r\ndevastating with all their might those plantations which were the pride\r\nand the hope of the nephew of Aragon! They had already laid low several\r\ncocoa groves, torn up the sugar-canes, broken down the bananas, and\r\nsliced off the green pineapples.\r\n\r\nIndignant at such vandalism, Marcoy caught the first offender by the\r\nplaited tails at the back of the neck. \"What are you doing?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"I am neither crazy nor drunk, Taytachay\" (dear little father), calmly\r\nexplained the peon with his placid smile. \"But my fellows and I don't\r\nwant to be sent any more to work at Sausipata.\" As the white man\r\nregarded him with stupefaction, \"Thou art strange here,\" pursued the\r\nIndian, \"and canst know nothing about us. Promise not to tell Aragon,\r\nand I will make thee wise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why Aragon more than anybody else?\" asked Marcoy.\r\n\r\n\"Because Senor Aragon is nephew to Don Rebollido, the governor, and\r\nSausipata belongs to Rebollido; and if he were to learn what we have\r\ndone, we should be flogged and sent to prison to rot.\"\r\n\r\nThe explanation, drawn out with many threats when the Indians had been\r\ndriven from their work of ruin and placed once more in line of march,\r\nwas curious.\r\n\r\nThe able gobernador of Marcapata had had the sagacious idea of making\r\nthe local penitentiary out of his farm of Sausipata! It was cultivated\r\nentirely by the labor of his culprits. When culprits were scarce, the\r\nchicha-drinkers, the corner-loungers, became criminals and disturbers of\r\nthe peace, for whom a sojourn at Sausipata was the obvious cure. Aragon,\r\nthe nephew, shared his uncle's ability, and visited the plantation month\r\nby month. But the life in this paradise was not relished by the\r\nconvicts. The regimen was strict, the food everywhere abounding, was not\r\nfor them, and the vicinity of the wild Chunchos was not reassuring.\r\nOften a peon would appear in the market-place of Marcapata wrapped\r\nmerely in a banana leaf, which, cracking in the sun, reduced all\r\npretence of decent covering to an irony. This evidence of the spoliation\r\nof a Chuncho would be received in the worst possible part by the\r\ngobernador, who would beat the complainant back to his servitude,\r\nremarking with ingenuity that Providence was more responsible for the\r\nacts of the savages than he was.\r\n\r\nThis strange history, told with profound earnestness, was enough to\r\nmake any one laugh, but Marcoy could not be blind to its side of\r\noppression and tyranny. This was the way, then, that the humble and\r\nprimitive gobernador, who had presented himself to the travelers\r\nbarefoot, was enriching himself by the knaveries of office! Marcoy could\r\nnot take heart to inform Juan of Aragon of the devastation behind him,\r\nbut on the other hand he resolved to correct the abuse on his return by\r\nappeal, if necessary, to the prefect of Cuzco.\r\n\r\nA frightful night in a deserted hut on a site called Jimiro--where\r\nMarcoy had for mattress the legs of one of the porters, and for pillow\r\nthe back of a bark-hunter--followed the exodus from Sausipata. The\r\nGuarapascana, the Saniaca, the Chuntapunco, flowing into the Cconi on\r\nopposite sides, were successively left behind our adventurers, and they\r\nbowed for an instant before the tomb of a stranger, \"a German from\r\nGermany,\" as Pepe Garcia said, \"who pretended to know the language of\r\nthe Chunchos, and who interpreted for himself, but who starved in the\r\nwilderness near the heap of stones you see.\" Leaving this resting-place\r\nof an interpreter who had interpreted so little, the party attained a\r\nstream of rather unusual importance. The reputed gold-bearing river of\r\nOuitubamba rolled from its tunnel before them, exciting the most\r\nvisionary schemes in the mind of Colonel Perez, to whom its auriferous\r\nreputation was familiar. Nothing would do but that the California\r\nprocess of \"panning\" must be carried out in these Peruvian waters, and\r\nthe peons, _multum reluctantes,_ were summoned to the task, with all the\r\ncrow-bars and shovels possessed by the expedition, supplemented by\r\ncertain sauce-pans and dishes hypothecated from the culinary department.\r\nThe issue of the stream from under a crown of indigenous growths was the\r\nsite of this financial speculation. Pepe Garcia was placed at the head\r\nof the enterprise. A long ditch was dug, revealing milky quartz, ochres\r\nand clay. The deceptive hue of the yellow earth made the search a long\r\nand tantalizing one. At the moment when the colonel, attracted by\r\nsomething glistening in the large frying-pan which he was agitating at\r\nthe edge of the stream, uttered an exclamation which drew all heads into\r\nthe cavity of his receptacle, an answering sound from the heavens caused\r\neverybody suddenly to look up. An equatorial storm had gathered\r\nunnoticed over their heads. In a few minutes a solid sheet of warm\r\nrain, accompanied by a furious tornado sweeping through the valley,\r\ncaused whites and Indians to scatter as if for their lives. The golden\r\ndream of Colonel Perez and the similar vision entertained by Pepe Garcia\r\nwere dissipated promptly by this answer of the elements. On attaining\r\nthe neighboring sheds of Maniri the gold--seekers abandoned their\r\nimplements without remark to the services of the cooks, and betook\r\nthemselves to wringing out their stockings as if they had never dreamed\r\nof walking in silver slippers through the streets of Cuzco. They made no\r\nfurther attempt to wring gold from the mouth of the Ouitubamba. As for\r\nManiri, it was the last site or human resting-place of any, the very\r\nmost trivial, kind before the opening of the utter wilderness which\r\nproceeded to accompany the course of the Cconi River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE REPUTED GOLD-BEARING RIVER OR OUITUBAMBA ROLLED FROM\r\nITS TUNNEL.\"]\r\n\r\nThe Bolivians imagined an exploration of a little stream on the left\r\nbank, the Chuntapunco, which they thought might issue from a\r\nquinine-bearing region. They built a little raft, and departed with\r\nprovisions for three or four days. They returned, in fact, after a\r\nweek's absence, with seven varieties of cinchona--the _hirsuta,\r\nlanceolata, purpurea_ and _ovata_ of Ruiz and Pavon, and three more of\r\nlittle value and unknown names.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of the cascarilleros a flat calm reigned in the\r\najoupa of Maniri. Garcia and the colonel, the day after their\r\nunproductive gold-hunt, betook themselves into the forest, ostensibly\r\nfor game, but in reality to review their hopeful labors by the banks of\r\nthe Ouitubamba. Aragon was detailed by Mr. Marcoy to accompany him in\r\nhis botanical and entomological tours. On these excursions the\r\nacquaintance between the mozo and the señor was considerably developed.\r\nThe youth had naturally a gay and confident disposition, and added not a\r\nlittle to the liveliness of the trips. Marcoy profited by their stricter\r\nconnection to converse with him about the cultivation of the farm at\r\nSausipata, making use of a venial deception to let him think that the\r\nplan of operations had been communicated by the governor himself.\r\nAragon modestly replied that the plantation in question was only the\r\nfirst of a series of similar clearings contemplated by his uncle at\r\nvarious points in the valley. Arrangements made for this purpose with\r\nthe governors of Ocongata and Asaroma, who were pledged with their\r\nsupport in return for heavy presents, would enable him soon to cultivate\r\ncoffee and sugar and cocoa at once in a number of haciendas. The\r\nenterprise was a splendid one; and if God--Aragon pronounced the name\r\nwithout a particle of diffidence--deigned to bless it, the day was\r\ncoming when the fortune of his uncle, solidly established, would make\r\nhim the pride and the joy of the region.\r\n\r\nIt may as well be mentioned here that the subsequent career of the\r\nchest-nut-colored interpreter is not entirely unknown. In 1860, Mr.\r\nClement Markham, collecting quinine-plants for the British government,\r\ncame upon a splendid hacienda thirty miles from the village of Ayapata,\r\nin a valley of the Andes near the scene of this exploration. Here, on\r\nthe sugar-cane estate named San José de Bellavista, he discovered \"an\r\nintelligent and enterprising Peruvian\" named Aragon, who appears to have\r\nbeen none other than our interpreter escaped from the chrysalis. His\r\nestablishment was very large, and protected from the savages by two\r\nrivers, Aragon had made a mule-road of thirty miles to the village. He\r\nfound the manufacture of spirits for the sugar-cane more profitable than\r\ndigging for gold in the Ouitubamba or hunting for cascarillas along the\r\nCconi. In 1860 he sent an expedition into the forest after wild\r\ncocoa-plants. An india-rubber manufactory had only failed for want of\r\ngovernment assistance. He contemplated the establishment of a line of\r\nsteamers on the neighboring rivers to carry off the commerce of his\r\nplantations. \"Any scheme for developing the resources of the country is\r\nsure to receive his advocacy,\" says Mr. Markham: \"it would be well for\r\nPeru if she contained many such men.\"\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBATIONER LEONHARD;\r\n\r\nOR, THREE NIGHTS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nOUR HERO.\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Leonhard Marten walked out on the promenade at the usual hour\r\none afternoon, after a good deal of hesitation, for there was quite as\r\nlittle doubt in his mind as there is in mine that the thing to do was to\r\nremain within-doors and answer the letters--or rather the letter--lying\r\non his table. The brief epistle which conveyed to him the regrets of the\r\nnew female college building committee, that his plans were too elaborate\r\nand costly, and must therefore be declined, really demanded no reply,\r\nand would probably never have one. It was the hurried scrawl from his\r\nfriend Wilberforce which claimed of his sense of honor an answer by the\r\nnext mail. The letter from Wilberforce was dated Philadelphia, and ran\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR LENNY: Please deposit five thousand for me in some good bank of\r\nPennsylvania or New York. I shall want it, maybe, within a week or so. I\r\nam talking hard about going abroad. Why can't you go along? Say we sail\r\non the first of next month. Richards is going, and I shall make enough\r\nout of the trip to pay expenses for all hands. You'll never know\r\nanything about your business, Mart, till you have studied in one of\r\nthose old towns. Answer. Thine,\r\n\r\n\"WIL.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I say that Leonhard had, or _had_ had, ten thousand dollars of\r\nWilberforce's money, and that he was now about as unprepared to meet the\r\ndemand recorded as he would have been if he had never seen a cent of the\r\nsum mentioned, the assertion, I think, is justified that his place was\r\nat his office-table, and not on the promenade. What if the town-clock\r\nhad struck four? what if at this hour Miss Ayres usually rounded the\r\ncorner of Granby street on her way home? But, poor fellow! he _had_\r\ntried to think his way through the difficulty. Every day for a week he\r\nhad exercised himself in letter--writing: he had practiced every style,\r\nfrom the jocular to the gravely interrogative, and had succeeded pretty\r\nwell as a stylist, but the point, the point, the bank deposit, remained\r\nstill insurmountable and unapproachable.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice he had thought that probably the best thing to do was to\r\ngo off on a long journey, and by and by, when things had righted\r\nthemselves somehow, find out where Wilberforce was and acknowledge his\r\nletter with regrets and explanations. He was considering this course\r\nwhen he destroyed his last effort, and went out on the promenade to get\r\nrid of his thoughts and himself and to meet Miss Ayres. The present\r\ncontained Miss Ayres; as to the future, it was dark as midnight; for the\r\npast, it was not in the least pleasant to think of it, and how it had\r\ncome to pass that Wilberforce trusted him.\r\n\r\nThe days when he and Wilberforce were lads, poor, sad-hearted, all but\r\nhomeless, returned upon him with their shadows. It was in those days\r\nthat his friend formed so lofty an estimate of his exactness in figures\r\nand his skill in saving, and thus it had happened that when the engine\r\nconstructed by Wilberforce began to pay him so past belief, he was\r\nreally in the perplexity concerning places of deposit which he had\r\nexpressed to Marten. Leonhard chanced to be with this young Croesus--who\r\nhad begun life by dipping water for invalids at the springs--when the\r\nten thousand dollars alluded to were paid him by a dealer; and the\r\ninstant transfer of the money to his hands was one of those off-hand\r\nperformances which, apparently trivial, in the end search a man to the\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nWhat had become of the money? Seven thousand dollars were swallowed up\r\nin a gulf which never gives back its treasure. And oh on the verge of\r\nthat same gulf how the siren had sung! A chance of clearing five\r\nthousand dollars by investing that amount presented itself to Leonhard:\r\nit was one of those investments which will double a man's money for him\r\nwithin three months, or six months at latest. The best men of A---- were\r\nin the enterprise, and by going into it Leonhard would reap every sort\r\nof advantage. He might give up teaching music, and confine himself to\r\nthe studies which as an architect he ought to pursue; and to be known\r\namong the A--- landers as a young gentleman who had money to invest\r\nwould secure to him that social position which the music-lessons he gave\r\ndid no doubt in some quarters embarrass.\r\n\r\nIt was while buoyed up by his \"great expectations,\" and flattered by the\r\nattentions which strangely enough began to be extended toward him by\r\nsome of the \"best men\"--who also were stockholders in the new\r\nsugar-refining process--that Leonhard took a room at the Granby House,\r\nand began to manifest a waning interest in his work as a music-master.\r\n\r\nThis display of himself, modest though it was, cost money. Before the\r\nletter quoted was written Leonhard had begun to feel a little troubled:\r\nhe had been obliged to add two thousand dollars to his original\r\ninvestment, and the thought that possibly there might be a demand for a\r\nyet further sum--for some unforeseen difficulty had arisen in the matter\r\nof machinery--had fixed in his mind a misgiving to which at odd moments\r\nhe returned with a flutter of spirits amounting almost to panic.\r\n\r\nOn the promenade he met Miss Ayres. She stood before the window of a\r\nmusic-dealer's shop, looking at the photograph of some celebrity--a tall\r\nand not too slightly-formed young lady, attired in a buff suit with\r\nbrown trimmings, and a brown hat from which a pretty brown feather\r\ndepended. On her round cheeks was a healthy glow, deepened perhaps by\r\nexercise on that warm afternoon, and a trifle in addition, it may be, by\r\nthe sound of footsteps advancing. Yet as Leonhard approached, she,\r\nchancing to look around, did not seem surprised that he was so near. Not\r\nthat she expected him! What reason had she for supposing that from his\r\noffice-window he would see her the instant she turned the corner of\r\nGranby street and walked down the avenue fronting the parade-ground? No\r\nreason of course; but this had happened so many times that the meeting\r\nof the two somewhere in this vicinity was daily predicted by the wise\r\nprophets of the street.\r\n\r\nA rumor was going about A---- in those days which occasioned the mother\r\nof our young lady a little uneasiness. When Leonhard came to A---- it\r\nwas to live by his profession--music. He was an enthusiast in the\r\nscience, and the best people patronized him. He might have all the\r\npupils he pleased now, and at his own prices, thought Mrs. Washington\r\nAyres, who had herself taught music: why doesn't he stick to his\r\nbusiness? But then, she reminded herself, they say he has money; and he\r\nis so bewitched about architecture that he can't let it alone. Too many\r\nirons in the fire to please me! Perhaps, though, if he has money, it\r\nmakes not so much difference. But I don't like to see a young man\r\ndabbling in too many things: it looks as if he would never do anything\r\nto speak of. It is the only thing I ever heard of against him; but if he\r\ncan't make up his mind, I don't know as there could be anything much\r\nworse to tell of a man.\r\n\r\nShe was not far wrong in her thinking, and she had seen the great fault\r\nin the character of young Mr. Marten. It was his nature to take up and\r\nembrace cordially, as if for life, the objects that pleased him. Perhaps\r\nthe tendency conduced to his popularity and reputation as a\r\nmusic-master, for his acquaintance with the works of composers was\r\nreally vast; but the effect of it was not so hopeful when it set him to\r\nstudying a difficult art almost without instruction, in the confidence\r\nthat he should soon by his works take rank with Angelo, Wren and other\r\ngreat masters.\r\n\r\nAt the music-dealer's window Mr. Leonhard stood for a moment beside\r\nMiss Marion, and then said with a queer smile, \"How cool it looks over\r\nyonder among the trees! I wish somebody would like to walk there with an\r\nescort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anybody might, I should think,\" answered the young lady. \"I have waded\r\nthrough hot dust, red-hot dust, all the afternoon. Besides, I want to\r\nask you, Mr. Marten, what it means. Everybody is coming to me for\r\nlessons. Are you refusing instruction, or are you growing so unpopular\r\nof late? I have vexed myself trying to answer the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"They all come to you, do they? Yes, I think I am growing unpopular. And\r\nI am rather glad of it, on the whole,\" answered Leonhard, not quite\r\nclear as to her meaning, but not at all disturbed by it.\r\n\r\n\"I know they must all have gone to you first,\" she said. \"Of course they\r\nall went to you first, and you wouldn't have them.\"\r\n\r\nLeonhard smiled on. Her odd talk was pleasant to him, and to look at her\r\nbright face was to forget every disagreeable thing in the world. \"You\r\nknow I have been thinking that I would give up instruction altogether,\"\r\nsaid he; \"but I suppose that unless I actually go away to get rid of my\r\npupils, I shall have a few devoted followers to the last. The more you\r\ntake off my hands the better I shall like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how should everybody know that you _think_ of giving up\r\ninstruction?\" Miss Marion inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I dare say I have told everybody,\" he answered carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said she; and two or three thoughts passed through the mind of the\r\nyoung lady quite worthy the brain of her mother. \"I am half sorry,\" she\r\ncontinued. \"But at least you cannot forget what you know. That is a\r\ncomfort. And I am sure you love music too well to let me go on\r\ncommitting barbarisms with my hands or voice without telling me.\"\r\n\r\nLeonhard hesitated. How far might he take this dear girl into his\r\nsecrets? \"My friend Wilberforce is always saying that I ought to study\r\nabroad in the old European towns before I launch out in earnest,\" said\r\nhe finally.\r\n\r\n\"As architect or musician?\" asked the \"dear girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"As architect, of course,\" he answered, without manifesting surprise at\r\nthe question. \"He is going himself now, and he wants me to go with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go?\" The quick look with which he followed this question\r\nmade Miss Marion add: \"It would be the best thing in the world for--for\r\na student, I should think. You said once that your indecision was the\r\nbane of your life. I beg your pardon for remembering it. When you have\r\nheard the best music and seen the best architecture, you can put an end\r\nto this 'thirty years' war,' and come back and settle down.\"\r\n\r\n\"All very well,\" said he, \"but please to tell me where I shall find you\r\nwhen I come home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I shall be jogging along somewhere, depend.\"\r\n\r\n\"With your mind made up concerning every event five years before it\r\nhappens? If you had my choice to make, you think, I suppose, that you\r\nwould decide in a minute which road to fame and fortune you would\r\nchoose.\" Mr. Leonhard used his cane as vehemently while he spoke as if\r\nhe were a conductor swinging his baton through the most exciting\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand your perplexity, that is the fact,\" said she with\r\nwonderful candor; \"but then I have been trained to do one thing from the\r\ntime I could wink.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was expected of me that I should rival the greatest performers,\"\r\nsaid Leonhard with a half-sad smile. \"If I go abroad now, as you\r\nadvise--\"\r\n\r\n\"Advise? I advise!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the least creature moving. Never!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you did you would say, 'Keep to music.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say, 'Keep to architecture.' Then--don't you see?--I should\r\nhave all your pupils.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would matter little: you have long had all that I could give you\r\nworth the giving, Miss Ayres.\"\r\n\r\nWere these words intent on having utterance, and seeking their\r\nopportunity?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her lightness and seeming unconcern the young lady found\r\nherself challenged, as it were, by the stern voice of a sentinel on\r\nguard. But she answered on the instant: \"The most delicious music I have\r\never heard, for which I owe you endless thanks. I have said\r\narchitecture; but I never advise, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has not understood me,\" thought Leonhard, but instead of taking\r\nadvantage of that conclusion and retiring from the ground, he said,\r\n\"Perhaps I must speak more clearly. I don't care what I do or where I\r\ngo, Miss Marion, if you are indifferent. I love you.\"\r\n\r\nWhat did he read in the face which his dark eyes scanned as they turned\r\nfull upon it? Was it \"I love you\"? Was it \"Alas!\"? He could not tell.\r\n\r\n\"You are pledged to love 'the True and the Beautiful,'\" said she quite\r\ngayly, \"and so I am not surprised.\"\r\n\r\nLeonhard looked mortified and angry. A man of twenty-two declaring love\r\nfor the first time to a woman had a right to expect better treatment.\r\n\r\n\"I have offended you,\" she said instantly. \"I only followed out your own\r\ntrain of thought. You may have half a dozen professions, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at least clear that I love only you,\" he said. \"I hoped you would\r\nfeel that. It is certain, I think, that I shall confine myself to the\r\nstudies of an architect hereafter. I will give no more lessons. And\r\nshall you care to know whether I go or stay?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Ayres answered--almost as if in spite of herself and that good\r\njudgment for which she had been sufficiently praised during her eighteen\r\nyears of existence--\"Yes, I shall care a vast deal. That is the reason\r\nwhy I say, 'Go, if it seems best to you'--'Stay, if you think it more\r\nwise.' I have the confidence in you that sees you can conduct your own\r\naffairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I go,\" he cried in a happy voice, in strong contrast with his words,\r\n\"it will be to leave everything behind me that can make life sweet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you go it will be to gain everything that can make life\r\nhonorable. I did not understand that you thought of going for pleasure.\"\r\nAh, how almost tender now her look and tone!\r\n\r\n\"Say but once to me what I have said to you,\" said Leonhard joyfully,\r\nconfident now that he had won the great prize.\r\n\r\n\"Now? No: don't talk about it. Wait a while, and we will see if there is\r\nanything in it.\" What queer lover's mood was this? Miss Marion looked as\r\nif she had passed her fortieth birthday when she spoke in this wise.\r\n\r\n\"Oh for a soft sweet breeze from the north-east to temper such cruel\r\nblasts!\" exclaimed Leonhard. \"Was ever man so treated as I am by this\r\nstrong-minded young woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody on the grounds is looking, and wondering how she will get\r\nhome with the intemperate young gentleman she is escorting. Did you say\r\nyou were going to talk with your friend Mr. Wilberforce about going\r\nabroad with him for a year or two?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said no such thing, but perhaps I may. I was going to write, but it\r\nmay be as easy to run down to Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Easier, I should say.\"\r\n\r\nSo they talked, and when they parted Leonhard said: \"If you do not see\r\nme to-morrow evening, you will know that I have gone to Philadelphia. I\r\nshall not write to let you know. You might feel that an answer was\r\nexpected of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never been taught the arts of a correspondent, and it is quite\r\ntoo late to learn them,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nMiss Marion will probably never again feel as old as she does this\r\nafternoon, when she has half snubbed, half flattered and half accepted\r\nthe man she admires and loves, but whose one fault she clearly perceives\r\nand is seriously afraid of.\r\n\r\nThe next day Leonhard sat staring at Wilberforce's letter with a face as\r\nwrinkled as a young ape's in a cold morning fog. After one long serious\r\neffort he sprang from his seat, and I am afraid swore that he would go\r\ndown to Philadelphia that very afternoon. Therefore (and because he\r\nclung to the determination all day) at six o'clock behold him passing\r\nwith his satchel from the steps of the Granby House to the Grand\r\nDivision Dépôt. He was always going to and fro, so his departure\r\noccasioned no remark. He supposed, for his own part, that he was going\r\nto talk with his friend Wilberforce, and his ticket ensured his passage\r\nto Philadelphia; and yet at eight o'clock he found himself standing on\r\nthe steps of the Spenersberg Station, and saw the train move on. At the\r\nmoment when his will seemed to him to be completely demoralized the\r\nengine-whistle sounded and the engine stopped. Utterly unnerved by his\r\ndoubts, he slunk from the car like an escaping convict, and looked\r\ntoward the narrow moonlit valley which was as a gate leading into this\r\nunknown Spenersberg. The path looked obscure and inviting, and so,\r\nwithout exchanging a word with any one, he walked forward, a more\r\npitiable object than is pleasant to consider, for he was no coward and\r\nno fool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nIN THE HAPPY VALLEY.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Leonhard Marten was paying for his ticket in the\r\ndépôt at A----, how many events were taking place elsewhere! Multitudes,\r\nmultitudes going up and down the earth perplexed, tempted, discouraged.\r\nWhat were _you_ doing at that hour? I wonder.\r\n\r\nEven here, at this Spenersberg, was Frederick Loretz--with reason deemed\r\none of the most fortunate of the men gathered in the happy\r\nvalley--asking himself, as he walked homeward from the factory, \"What is\r\nthe use?\"\r\n\r\nWhen he spied his wife on the piazza he seemed to doubt for a second\r\nwhether he should go backward or forward. Into that second of\r\nvacillation, however, the voice of the woman penetrated: \"Husband, so\r\nearly? Welcome home!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice decided him, and so he opened his gate, passed along the\r\ngraveled walk to the piazza steps, ascended, wiping the perspiration\r\nfrom his bald head, dropped his handkerchief into his hat and his hat\r\nupon the floor, and sat down in one of the great wide-armed wooden\r\nchairs which visitors always found awaiting them on the piazza.\r\n\r\nHis wife, having bestowed upon him one brief glance, quickly arose and\r\nwent into the house: the next moment she came again, bringing with her a\r\npitcher of iced water and a goblet, which she placed before him on a\r\nsmall rustic table. But a second glance showed her that he was suffering\r\nfrom something besides the heat and fatigue. There was a look on his\r\nbroad honest face that told as distinctly as color and expression could\r\ntell of anguish, consternation, remorse. He drank from the goblet she\r\nhad filled for him, and said, without looking at his wife, \"I have\r\nbrought you the worst news, Anna, that ever you heard.\" She must have\r\nguessed what it was instantly, but she made neither sign nor gesture.\r\nShe could have enumerated there and then all the sorrows of her life;\r\nbut for a moment it was not possible even for her to say that this\r\nimpending affliction was, in view of all she had endured, a light one,\r\neasy to be borne.\r\n\r\n\"It has gone against us,\" said Mr. Loretz, picking up his red silk\r\nhandkerchief and passing it from one hand to another, and finally hiding\r\nhis face within its ample dimensions for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean the lot?\" Her voice wavered a little. Though she asked or\r\nrefrained from asking, something had taken place which must be made\r\nknown speedily. Wherefore, then, delay the evil knowledge?\r\n\r\nHe signified by a nod that it was so.\r\n\r\n\"And that is in store for our poor child!\" said the mother.\r\n\r\nMr. Loretz was now quite broken down. He passed his handkerchief across\r\nhis face again, and this time made no answer.\r\n\r\nThen the mother, with lips firmly compressed, and eyes bent steadily\r\nupon the floor, and forehead crumpled somewhat, sat and held her peace.\r\n\r\nAt last the father said, in a low tone that gave to his strong voice an\r\nawful pathos, \"How can the child bear it, Anna? for she loves Spener\r\nwell--and to love _him_ well!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father,\" said the wife, who had by this time sounded the depth of\r\nthis tribulation, and was already ascending, \"how did we bear it when we\r\nhad to give up Gabriel, and Jacob, and dear little Carl?\"\r\n\r\n\"For me,\" said the man, rising and looking over the piazza rail into the\r\ngay little flower-garden beneath--\"for me all that was nothing to this.\"\r\n\r\n\"O my boys!\" the mother cried.\r\n\r\n\"We know that they went home to a heavenly Parent, and to more delight\r\nand honor than all the earth could give them,\" the father said.\r\n\r\n\"It rent the heart, Frederick, but into the gaping wound the balm of\r\nGilead was poured.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no man alive to be compared with Albert Spener.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know of one--but one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not one,\" he said with an emphasis which sternly rebuked the ill-timed,\r\nand, as he deemed, untruthful flattery. \"There is not his like, go where\r\nyou will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, how you have exalted him above all that is to be worshiped!\" sighed\r\nthe good woman, putting her hands together, and really as troubled and\r\nsympathetic, and cool and calculating, as she seemed to be.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you I have never seen his equal! Look at this place here--hasn't\r\nhe called it up out of the dust?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, he did. He made it all,\" she said. \"It must be conceded that\r\nAlbert Spener is a great man--in Spenersberg.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, then, can I keep back from him the best I have when he asks for it\r\n--asks for it as if I were a king to refuse him what he wanted if I\r\npleased? I would give him my life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Frederick, you have! It isn't you that denies now--think of that!\r\nRemind him of it. _Who_ spoke by the lot? Where are you going, husband?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Loretz had turned away from the piazza rail and picked up his hat.\r\nHis wife's question arrested him. \"I--I thought I would speak with\r\nBrother Wenck,\" said he, somewhat confused by the question, and looking\r\nalmost as if his sole purpose had been to go beyond the sound of his\r\nwife's remonstrating voice.\r\n\r\n\"Husband, about this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Anna.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go. What will he think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows about it yet, except Wenck, unless he spoke to Brother\r\nThorn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Frederick, what are you thinking?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking\"--he paused and looked fixedly at his wife--\"I am\r\nthinking that I have been beside myself, Anna--crazy, out and out, and\r\nthis thing can't stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Husband, it was our wish to learn the will of God concerning this\r\nmarriage, and we have learned it. The Lord----\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go back to the factory,\" said Mr. Loretz, turning quickly away\r\nfrom his wife. \"I must see if everything is right there before it gets\r\ndarker.\" He had caught sight of the tall figure of a woman at the gate\r\nwhen he snatched up his hat so suddenly and interrupted his wife. Then\r\nhe turned to her again: \"Is Elise within?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, husband: she went to the garden for twigs this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"She had not heard?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It is Sister Benigna that is coming. Must you go back?\" She poured\r\nanother glass of water for her husband, and walked down the steps with\r\nhim; and coming so, out from the shade into the sunlight, Sister Benigna\r\nwas startled by their faces as though she had seen two ghosts.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, Mr. Loretz again turned his steps homeward, and Mr.\r\nWenck, the minister, walked with him as far as the gate. They had met\r\naccidentally upon the sidewalk, and Mr. Loretz must of necessity make\r\nsome allusion to the letter he had received from the minister that day\r\nacquainting him with the allotment which had made of him so hopeless a\r\nmourner. The good man hesitated a moment before making response: then\r\nhe took both the hands of Loretz in his, and said in a deep, tender\r\nvoice, \"Brother, the wound smarts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot bear it!\" cried Loretz. \"It is all my doing, and I must have\r\nbeen crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"When in devout faith you sought to know God's will concerning your dear\r\nchild?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot talk about it,\" was the impatient response. \"And you cannot\r\nunderstand it,\" he continued, turning quickly upon his companion. \"You\r\nhave never had a daughter, and you don't understand Albert Spener.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said the minister patiently--\"I think I know him well enough\r\nto see what the consequence will be if he should suspect that Brother\r\nLoretz is like 'a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed.'\"\r\n\r\nYet as the minister said this his head drooped, his voice softened, and\r\nhe laid his hand on the shoulder of Mr. Loretz, as if he would fain\r\nspeak on and in a different strain. It was evident that the distressed\r\nman did not understand him, and reproof or counsel was more than he\r\ncould now bear. He walked on a little faster, and as he approached his\r\ngate voices from within were heard. They were singing a duet from _The\r\nMessiah_.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" said Loretz, his face suddenly lighting up with almost hope.\r\n\r\nMr. Wenck seemed disposed to accept the invitation: then, as he was\r\nabout to pass through the gate, he was stayed by a recollection\r\napparently, for he turned back, saying, \"Not to-night, Brother Loretz.\r\nThey will need all the time for practice. Let me tell you, I admire your\r\ndaughter Elise beyond expression. I wish that Mr. Spener could hear that\r\nvoice now: it is perfectly triumphant. You are happy, sir, in having\r\nsuch a daughter.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Wenck turned from the gate, Leonhard--our Leonhard\r\nMarten--approached swiftly from the opposite side of the street. He had\r\nbeen sitting under the trees half an hour listening to the singing, and,\r\nfull of enthusiasm, now presented himself before Mr. Loretz,\r\nexclaiming, \"Do tell me, sir, what singers are these?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Loretz knew every man in Spenersberg. He looked at the stranger, and\r\nanswered dryly, \"Very tolerable singers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so! I never heard anything so glorious. I am a stranger\r\nhere, sir. Can you direct me to a public-house?\"\r\n\r\nTo answer was easy. There was but the one inn, called the Brethren's\r\nHouse, the sixth below the one before which they were standing. It was a\r\nlong house, painted white, with a deep wide porch, where half a dozen\r\nyoung men probably sat smoking at this moment. Instead of giving this\r\ndirection, however, Loretz said, after a brief consultation with\r\nhimself, \"I don't know as there's another house in Spenersberg that\r\nought to be as open as mine. I live here, sir. How long have you been\r\nlistening?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not long enough,\" said Leonhard; and he passed through the gate, which\r\nhad been opened for the minister, and now was opened as widely for him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nHIGH ART.\r\n\r\nThe room into which Mr. Loretz conducted Leonhard seemed to our young\r\nfriend, as he glanced around it, fit for the court of Apollo. Its\r\nproportions had obviously been assigned by some music-loving soul. It\r\noccupied two-thirds of the lower floor of the house, and its high\r\nceiling was a noticeable feature. The furniture had all been made at the\r\nfactory; the floor-mats were woven there; and one gazing around him\r\nmight well have wondered to what useful or ornamental purpose the green\r\nwillows growing everywhere in Spenersberg Valley might not be applied.\r\nThe very pictures hanging on the wall--engraved likenesses of the great\r\nmasters Mozart and Beethoven--had their frames of well-woven willow\r\ntwigs; and the rack which held the books and sheets of music was\r\nornamented on each side with raised wreaths of flowers wrought by deft\r\nhands from the same pliant material.\r\n\r\nAt the piano, in the centre of the room, sat Sister Benigna--by her\r\nside, Elise Loretz.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, when Elise's father entered with the stranger, as if there\r\nmight be a suspension of the performance, but Loretz said, \"Two\r\nlisteners don't signify: we promise to make no noise. Sit down, sir:\r\ngive me your bag;\" and taking Leonhard's satchel, he retired with it to\r\na corner, where he sat down, and with his elbows on his knees, his head\r\nbetween his hands, prepared himself to listen.\r\n\r\nSister Benigna said to her companion, \"It is time we practiced before an\r\naudience perhaps;\" and they went on as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nAnd sitting in that cool room on the eve of a scorching and distracted\r\nday, is it any wonder that Leonhard composed himself to accept any\r\nmarvel that might present itself? Once across the threshold of the\r\nEvery-day, and there is nothing indeed for which one should not be\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nIf in mood somewhat less enthusiastic than that of our traveler we look\r\nin upon that little company, what shall we see?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, inevitably, Sister Benigna. But describe a picture,\r\nwill you, or the mountains, or the sea? It must have been something for\r\nthe Spenersberg folk to know that such a woman dwelt among them, yet\r\nprobably two-thirds of her influence was unconsciously put forth and as\r\nunconsciously received. They knew that in musical matters she inspired\r\nthem and exacted of them to the uttermost, but they did not and could\r\nnot know how much her life was worth to all of them, and that they lived\r\non a higher plane because of those half dozen wonderful notes of hers,\r\nand the unflagging enthusiasm which needed but the name of love-feast or\r\nfestival to bring a light into her lovely eyes that seemed to spread up\r\nand around her white forehead and beautiful hair like a supernatural\r\nlustre. There was a fire that animated her which nobody who saw its glow\r\nor felt its warmth could question. Without that altar of music--But why\r\nspeculate on what she might have been if she had not been what she was?\r\nThat would be to consider not Benigna, but somebody else.\r\n\r\nShe was accompanying Elise through Handel's \"Pastoral Symphony.\" Elise\r\nbegan: \"He is the righteous Saviour, and He shall speak peace unto the\r\nheathen.\" At the first notes Leonhard looked hastily toward the window,\r\nand if it had been a door he would have passed out on to the piazza,\r\nthat he might there have heard, unseeing, unseen. While he sat still and\r\nlooked and listened it seemed to him as if he had been engaged in\r\nfoolish games with children all his life. He sat as it were in the dust,\r\nscorning his own insignificance.\r\n\r\nThe young girl who now sat, now stood beside her, must have been the\r\nchild of her training. For six years, indeed, they have lived together\r\nunder one roof, sharing one apartment. Within the hour just passed, that\r\nhas been said by them toward which all the talk and all the action of\r\nthe six years has tended, and the heart of the girl lies in the hand of\r\nthe woman, and what will the woman do with it?\r\n\r\nPerhaps all that Benigna can do for Elise has to-day been accomplished.\r\nIt may be that to grow beside her now will be to grow in the shade when\r\nshade is needed no longer, and when the effect will be to weaken life\r\nand to deepen the spirit of dependence. Possibly sunlight though\r\nscorching, winds though wild, would be better for Elise now than the\r\nprotecting shadow of her friend.\r\n\r\nLooking at Elise, Leonhard feels more assured, more at home. She has a\r\nkindly face, a lovely face, he decides, and what a deliciously rich,\r\nsmooth voice! She is rather after the willowy order in her slender\r\nperson, and when she begins to sing \"Rejoice greatly,\" he looks at her\r\nastonished, doubting whether the sound can really have proceeded from\r\nher slender throat. He is again reminded of Marion, but by nothing he\r\nhears or sees: poor Marion has her not small reputation as a singer in\r\nA----, yet her voice, compared with this, is as wire--gold wire\r\nindeed--wire with a _color_ of richness at least; while Elise's is as\r\nhoney itself--honey with the flavor of the sweetest flowers in it, and,\r\ntoo, the suggestion of the bee's swift, strong wing.\r\n\r\nInto the room comes at last Mrs. Loretz. It is just as Elise takes up\r\nthe final air of the symphony that she appears. She would look upon her\r\ndaughter while she sings, \"Come unto Him, all ye that labor and are\r\nheavy laden, and He shall give you rest. Take His yoke upon you, and\r\nlearn of Him,\" etc. Chiefly to look upon her child she comes--to listen\r\nwith her loving, confident eyes.\r\n\r\nBut on the threshold of the music-room she pauses half a second,\r\nperceiving the stranger by the window: then she nods pleasantly to him,\r\nwhich motion sets the short silvery hair on her forehead waving, as\r\ncurls would have waved there had she only let them. She wears a cap\r\ntrimmed with a blue ribbon tied beneath her chin, and such is the order\r\nof her comely gown and apron that it commands attention always, like a\r\ntrue work of art.\r\n\r\nShe sits down beside her husband, and presently, as by the flash of a\r\nsingle glance indeed, has taken the weight and measure of the gentleman\r\nopposite. She likes his appearance, admires his fine dark face and his\r\nfine dark eyes, wonders where he came from, what he wants, and--will he\r\nstay to tea?\r\n\r\nGazing at her daughter, she looks a little sad: then she smooths her\r\ndress, straightens herself, shakes her head, and is absorbed in the\r\nmusic, beating time with tiny foot and hand, and following every strain\r\nwith an intentness which draws her brows together into a slight frown.\r\nElise almost smiles as she glances toward her mother: she knows where to\r\nfind enthusiasm at a white heat when it is wanted. With the final\r\nrepetition, \"Ye shall find rest to your souls,\" the dame rises quickly,\r\nand hastening to her daughter embraces her; then passing to the next\r\nroom, she pauses, perhaps long enough to wipe her eyes; then the jingle\r\nof a bell is heard.\r\n\r\nAt the ringing of this bell, Sister Benigna rose instantly, saying,\r\n\"Welcome sound!\" Loretz also came forth from his corner. He was about to\r\nspeak to Leonhard, when Benigna took up the trombone which was lying on\r\nthe piano, and said, \"I am curious to know how many rehearsals you have\r\nhad, sir. It is time, Elise, that our trombonist reported.\"\r\n\r\nLoretz, casting an eye toward his daughter, said, \"Never mind Sister\r\nBenigna. Our quartette will be all right.\" Then he turned to Leonhard:\r\nit was not now that he felt for the first time the relief of the\r\nstranger's presence. \"We are going to take food,\" said he: \"will you\r\ngive me your name and come with us?\"\r\n\r\nLeonhard gave his name, and moreover his opinion that he had trespassed\r\ntoo long already on the hospitality of the house.\r\n\r\nTo this remark Loretz paid no attention. \"Wife,\" he called out, \"isn't\r\nthat name down in the birthday book--_Leonhard Marten?_ I am sure of it.\r\nHe was a Herrnhuter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely, husband,\" was the answer from the other room. \"Will you\r\ncome, good people?\" The good people who heard that voice understood just\r\nwhat its tone meant, and there was an instant response.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, sir,\" said Loretz; and the invitation admitted no argument,\r\nfor he went forward at once with a show of alacrity sufficient to\r\nsatisfy his wife. \"This young man here was looking for a public-house.\r\nThey are full at the Brethren's, I hear. I thought he could not do\r\nbetter than take luck with us,\" he said to her by way of explanation.\r\n\r\n\"He is welcome,\" said the wife in a prompt, business-like tone, which\r\nwas evidently her way. \"Daughter!\" She looked at Elise, and Elise\r\nbrought a plate, knife and fork for \"this young man,\" and placed them\r\nwhere her mother indicated--that is, next herself. Between the mother\r\nand daughter Leonhard therefore took refuge, as it were, from the rather\r\ntoo majestic presence opposite known as Sister Benigna. He should have\r\nfelt at ease in the little circle, for not one of them but felt the\r\naddition to their party to be a diversion and a relief. As to Dame Anna\r\nLoretz, thoughts were passing through her mind which might pass through\r\nthe minds of others also in the course of time should Leonhard prove to\r\nbe a good Moravian and decide to remain among them. They were thoughts\r\nwhich would have sent a dubious smile around the board, however, could\r\nthey have been made known just now to Elise and her father and Sister\r\nBenigna; and what would our young friend--from the city evidently--have\r\nlooked or said could they have been communicated to him? Already the\r\nmind and heart of the mother of Elise, disconcerted and distracted for\r\nthe moment by that untoward casting of the lot, had risen to a calm\r\nsurvey of the situation of things; and now she was endeavoring to\r\nreconcile herself to the prospect which imagination presented to the eye\r\nof faith, _If_ she had perceived in the unannounced appearing of the\r\nyoung gentleman who sat near her devouring with keen appetite the good\r\nfare before him, and apologizing for his hunger with a grace which\r\nensured him constant renewal of vanishing dishes,--if she had perceived\r\nin it a manifestation of the will of Providence, she could not have\r\nsmiled on Leonhard more kindly, or more successfully have exerted\r\nherself to make him feel at home.\r\n\r\nAnd might not Mr. Leonhard have congratulated himself? If there was a\r\n\"great house\" in Spenersberg, this was that mansion; and if there were\r\ngreat people there, these certainly were they. And to think of finding\r\nin this vale cultivators of high art, intelligent, simple-hearted,\r\nearnest, beautiful!\r\n\r\nCAROLINE CHESEBRO'.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH CAPITAL.\r\n\r\nThe metropolis of Ireland about the middle of the last century was the\r\nfourth in Europe in point of size. Since then it has made little\r\nprogress in comparison with many others. Yet it is a large place,\r\ncovering a great area, and holding a population which numbers some three\r\nhundred thousand souls.\r\n\r\nIt may further be said that notwithstanding the withdrawal, consequent\r\non the Union, of the aristocratic classes from Dublin, the city has\r\nimproved more in the last fifty years than at any previous period.\r\nDublin, at the Union, and for some time after, was a very dirty place\r\nindeed. To-day, although, from that antipathy to paint common to the\r\nwhole Irish nation--which can apparently never realize the Dutch\r\nproverb, that \"paint costs nothing,\" or the English one, that \"a stitch\r\nin time saves nine\"--much of the town looks dingy, it is, as a whole,\r\ncleaner than almost any capital in Europe, so far as drainage and the\r\nsanitary state of the dwellings are concerned. And here we speak from\r\nexperience, having last year, in company with detective officers,\r\nvisited all its lowest and poorest haunts.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this sanitary excellence is that matters of this kind are\r\nplaced entirely in the hands of the police, who rigorously carry out the\r\norders given to them on such points. It is devoutly to be hoped that a\r\nsimilar system will ere long be in vogue in the towns of our own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe noblesse have now quite deserted the Irish capital. Besides the\r\nlord-chancellor, there is probably not a single peer occupying a house\r\nthere to-day. Houses are excellent and very cheap. An immense mansion in\r\nthe best situation can be had for a thousand dollars a year. The markets\r\nare capitally supplied, and the prices are generally about one-third of\r\nthose of New York. Not a single item of living is dear. But,\r\nnotwithstanding these and many other advantages, the place has lost\r\npopularity, has a \"deadly-lively\" air about it, and, it must be\r\nadmitted, is in many respects wondrously dull, especially to those who\r\nhave been used to the brisk life of a great commercial or\r\npleasure-loving capital.\r\n\r\n\"Cornelius O'Dowd\" paid a visit to Dublin in 1871 after a long absence,\r\nand said some very pretty things about it. Never was the company or\r\nclaret better. Well, the fact was, that while the great and lamented\r\nCornelius was there he was fêted and made much of. Lord Spencer gave him\r\na dinner, so did other magnates, and his séjour was one prolonged\r\nfeasting; but nevertheless the every-day life of the Irish capital is\r\nawfully and wonderfully dull, as those who know it best, and have the\r\ncream of such society as it offers, would in strict confidence admit.\r\nFrom January to May there is an attempt at a \"season,\" during the\r\nearlier part of which the viceroy gives a great many entertainments.\r\nThese are remarkably well done, and the smaller parties are very\r\nagreeable. But politics intervene here, as in everything else in\r\nIreland, to mar considerably the brilliancy of the vice-regal court.\r\nWhen the Whigs are \"in\" the Tory aristocracy hold off from \"the Castle,\"\r\nand _vice versâ_. Dublin is generally much more brilliant under a Tory\r\nviceroy, inasmuch as nine-tenths of the Irish peerage and landed gentry\r\nsupport that side of politics. The vice-reign of the duke of Abercorn,\r\nthe last lord-lieutenant, will long be remembered as a period of\r\nexceptional splendor in the annals of Dublin. He maintained the dignity\r\nof the office in a style which had not been known for half a century,\r\nand in this respect proved particularly acceptable to people of all\r\nclasses. Besides, he is a man of magnificent presence, and has a fitting\r\nhelpmate (sister of Earl Russell) and beautiful daughters; and it was\r\nuniversally admitted that the round people had got into the round holes,\r\nso far as the duke and duchess were concerned.\r\n\r\nThe lord-lieutenant's levees and drawing-rooms take place at night, and\r\nare therefore much more cheerful than similar ceremonials at Buckingham\r\nPalace. His Excellency kisses all the ladies presented to him. The\r\nvice-regal salary is one hundred thousand dollars, with allowances, but\r\nmost viceroys spend a great deal more. There are in such a poor country,\r\nwhere people have no sort of qualms about asking, innumerable claims\r\nupon their purses.\r\n\r\nThe office of viceroy of Ireland is one which prime ministers find it no\r\neasy task to fill. Just that kind of person is wanted for the office who\r\nhas no wish to hold it. A great peer with half a million of dollars'\r\nincome doesn't care about accepting troublesome and occasionally anxious\r\nduties, from which he, at all events, has nothing to gain. For some time\r\nLord Derby was in a quandary to get any one who would do to take it, and\r\nit may be doubted whether the marquis of Abercorn would have sacrificed\r\nhimself if the glittering prospect of a coronet all strawberry leaves\r\n(for he was created a duke while in office) had not been held before his\r\neyes. The vice-regal lodge is a plain, unpretending building. It is\r\ncharmingly situated in the Phoenix Park (1760 acres), and commands\r\ndelightful views over the Wicklow Mountains. Within, it is comfortable\r\nand commodious. The viceroy resides there eight months in the year. He\r\ngoes to \"the Castle\" from December to April. The Castle is \"no great\r\nthing.\" It is situated in the heart of Dublin. Around it are the various\r\ngovernment offices. St. Patrick's Hall is a fine apartment, but\r\ncertainly does not deserve the name of magnificent, and is a very poor\r\naffair compared with the reception-saloons of third-rate continental\r\nprinces.\r\n\r\nThe Dublin season culminates, so far at least as the vice-regal\r\nentertainments go, in the ball given here on St. Patrick's Day (March\r\n17). On such occasions it is _de rigueur_ to wear a court-dress. Even\r\nthose who venture to appear in the regulation trowsers admissible at a\r\nlevee at St. James's are seriously cautioned \"not to do it again.\"\r\n\r\nThough Dublin is now deserted by the aristocracy, most of the\r\n_grand-seigneur_ mansions are still standing. Leinster House, built\r\nabout 1760, and said to have served as a model for the \"White House,\"\r\nwas in 1815 sold by the duke to the Royal Dublin Society. Up to 1868 the\r\nduke of Leinster[1] was Ireland's only duke, and the house is certainly\r\na stately and appropriate ducal residence.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be confessed that there is something decidedly\r\n_triste_ and severe about this big mansion. A celebrated whilom tenant\r\nof it, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, appeared to think so, for in 1791 he\r\nwrites to his mother, after his return from the bright and sunny\r\natmosphere of America: \"I confess Leinster House does not inspire the\r\nbrightest ideas. By the by, what a melancholy house it is! You can't\r\nconceive how much it appeared so when first we came from Kildare. A\r\ncountry housemaid I brought with me cried for two days, and said she\r\nthought that she was in a prison.\" It was at Leinster House that \"Lord\r\nEdward\"--he is to this day always thus known by the people of Ireland,\r\nwho never think it needful to add his surname--after having joined \"the\r\nUnited Irishmen,\" had interviews with the informer Reynolds, who, it is\r\nbelieved, afterward betrayed him.\r\n\r\nLady Sarah Napier, mother of Sir William Napier, the well-known\r\nhistorian of the Peninsular War, and other eminent sons, was aunt to\r\nLord Edward, being sister of his mother. These ladies were daughters of\r\nthe duke of Richmond, and Lady Sarah was remarkable as being a lady to\r\nwhom George III. was passionately attached, and whom, but for the\r\nvehement opposition of his mother and her _entourage_, he would have\r\nmarried. In a journal of this lady's I find the following interesting\r\naccount of the search for her nephew: \"The separate warrant went by a\r\nmessenger, attended by the sheriff and a party of soldiers, into\r\nLeinster House. The servants ran to Lady Edward, who was ill, and told\r\nher. She said directly, 'There is no help: send them up.' They asked\r\nvery civilly for her papers and for Edward's, and she gave them all.\r\nHer apparent distress moved Major O'Kelly to tears, and their whole\r\nconduct was proper.\"\r\n\r\nLady Edward Fitzgerald (whose husband had served under Lord Moira in\r\nAmerica) was at Moira House on the evening of her husband's arrest.\r\nWriting from Castletown, county Kildare, two days after that event, Lady\r\nLouisa Connolly, Lord Edward's aunt, says: \"As soon as Edward's wound\r\nwas dressed he desired the private secretary at the Castle to write for\r\nhim to Lady Edward and tell her what had happened. The secretary carried\r\nthe note himself. Lady E. was at Moira House, and a servant of Lady\r\nMountcashel's came soon after to forbid Lady Edward's servants saying\r\nanything to her that night.\" She continued, after Lord E.'s death, to\r\nreside at Moira House till obliged by an order of the privy council to\r\nretire to England, where she became the guest of her husband's uncle,\r\nthe duke of Richmond.[2]\r\n\r\nLady Moira, who so kindly befriended Lady Edward, was unquestionably a\r\nvery remarkable woman, and had considerable influence, politically and\r\nsocially, in the Dublin of her day. Although an Englishwoman, she became\r\nin some respects _ipsis Hibernis Hibernior,_ and for a very long period\r\nprior to her death never quitted the soil of Ireland. Had the Irish\r\naristocracy generally been of the complexion of those who assembled in\r\nthe more intimate reunions at Moira House, the history of that country\r\nduring the past century would have been a widely different one. The\r\nmembers of that brilliant circle were thorough anti-Unionists, and Lord\r\nMoira and his sons-in-law, the earls of Granard and Mountcashel, proved\r\nthat they were not to be conciliated by bribes, either in money or\r\nhonors, by entering their formal protest against that measure on the\r\nbooks of the Irish House of Lords.\r\n\r\nWhen the delegates on behalf of Catholic claims came to London in 1792,\r\nit was this enlightened Irish nobleman who received them, and who, in\r\nthe event of the minister declining to admit them, intended as a peer to\r\nhave claimed an audience of the king. Lord Moira both in the English and\r\nIrish Houses of Peers denounced the oppressive measures of the\r\ngovernment, and his opposition gave so much offence that the English\r\ngeneral Lake was reported to hayer declared that if a town in the North\r\nwas to be burnt, they had best begin with Lord Moira's, causing him so\r\nmuch apprehension that he removed his collection, which was of\r\nextraordinary value, from his seat, Moira Hall, in the county Down, to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated John Wesley visited Lady Moira at Moira House in 1775,\r\n\"and was surprised to observe, though not a more grand, a far more\r\nelegant room than he had ever seen in England. It was an octagon, about\r\ntwenty feet square, and fifteen or sixteen high, having one window (the\r\nsides of it inlaid throughout with mother-of-pearl) reaching from the\r\ntop of the room to the bottom: the ceiling, sides and furniture of the\r\nroom were equally elegant.\" It was here that two of the greatest members\r\nof their respective legislatures--Charles Fox and Henry Grattan--first\r\nmet in 1777, and Moira House continued to be the scene of splendid\r\nentertainments up to the death of the first Lord Moira, in 1793. Wesley\r\nconcludes his letter about Moira House by asking, \"Must this too pass\r\naway like a dream?\" Whether like a dream or no, it certainly has been\r\nsignally the fate of this whilom proud mansion to pass from the highest\r\nto the very humblest almost at a bound. For some years after Lady\r\nMoira's death (in 1808) the house was kept up by the family, but in 1826\r\nit was let to an anti-mendicity society. The upper story was removed,\r\nthe mansion was stripped throughout of its splendid decorations--some\r\nof the furniture is now at Castle Forbes, the seat of the earl of\r\nGranard, Lady Moira's great-grandson, a worthy descendant--and the\r\nsaloons which were wont to be thronged with the most brilliant and\r\nsplendid society of the Irish metropolis in its heyday are now the abode\r\nof perhaps the very poorest outcasts who are to be found in the whole\r\nwide world.\r\n\r\nThe district in which Moira House stands has long ceased to be\r\nfashionable. The mansion stands close to the Liffey, a few yards back\r\nfrom the road. An elderly man who has charge of the mendicity\r\ninstitution for whose purposes the house is at present used, told me\r\nthat he remembered it when kept up by the family, although its members\r\nwere not actually residing there. What is now a fearfully dreary\r\ncourtyard, where the outcasts of Dublin disport themselves, was then, he\r\nsaid, a fine garden with splendid mulberry trees, which he, being a\r\nfavorite with the gardener, was permitted to climb--a circumstance which\r\nhad naturally impressed itself on his childish memory. I told him that I\r\nhad heard that long after the difficulties of the first marquis--who\r\nlent one hundred thousand pounds to George the Magnificent when that\r\nglorious prince was at the last gasp for _£ s. d_.--had compelled him to\r\npart with his large estates; in the county Down, he had retained\r\npossession of this mansion, and that it had even descended to the last\r\nmarquis, whose wild career concluded when he was only six-and-twenty;\r\nbut the old man thought it had passed from them long before. He\r\nremembered, he said, the last peer (with whom the title became extinct)\r\ncoming to Dublin, because he had an interview with him about some\r\nfurniture for his yacht, my informant being at that time in business,\r\nand he thought he should have heard if the property had been still\r\nretained. I asked if the marquis had exhibited any interest as to the\r\nold historical mansion of his family. \"Not the slightest,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nHardy, in his well-known life of Lord Charlemont, says: \"His (Lord\r\nMoira's) house will be long, very long, remembered: it was for many\r\nyears the seat of refined hospitality, of good nature and of good\r\nconversation. In doing the honors of it, Lord Moira had certainly one\r\nadvantage above most men, for he had every assistance that true\r\nmagnificence, the nobleness of manners peculiar to exalted birth, and\r\ntalents for society the most cultivated, could give him in his\r\nillustrious countess.\"\r\n\r\nPowerscourt House, a really noble mansion in St. Andrew street, is now\r\nused by a great wholesale firm, but is so little altered that it could\r\nbe fitted for a private residence again in a very brief time. The\r\nstaircase is grand in proportion, and the steps and balustrades are of\r\npolished mahogany, the last being richly carved.\r\n\r\nTyrone House is now the Education Office, and Mornington House, where\r\nWellington's father resided, and where or at Dangan--for it is a\r\ndoubtful point--the duke was born, is also used for government purposes.\r\n\r\nThe great squares of Dublin are St. Stephen's Green, Rutland, Mountjoy,\r\nMerrion and Fitzwilliam Squares. The first of these dates from the\r\nlatter half of the seventeenth century, and is probably in a far more\r\nprosperous condition now than it ever was before. If we are to judge by\r\nWhitelaw's history, it presented in 1819 an aspect such as no public\r\nsquare out of Dublin--the enclosure of Leicester Square, London,\r\nexcepted--could present. \"Of that kind of architectural beauty,\" he\r\nsays, \"which arises from symmetry and regularity, here are no traces.\"\r\nSome houses were on a level with the streets, others were approached by\r\na grand _perron_. The proprietors were of all degrees: here was the\r\ngreat house of a lord, there a miserable dramshop. The enclosure\r\nconsisted of no less than thirteen acres, making Stephen's Green the\r\nlargest public square in Europe. It was simply a great treeless field,\r\nwith an equestrian statue of George II. stuck in the middle of it. The\r\nprincipal entrance to the ground is described as \"decorated with four\r\npiers of black stone crowned with globes of mountain granite, once\r\nrespectable, but exhibiting shameful symptoms of neglect and decay.\"\r\nThere had been a gravel walk called the \"Beaux' Walk,\" from its having\r\nbeen a fashionable resort, \"but,\" says Whitelaw, \"the ditch which bounds\r\nit is now usually filled with stagnant water, which seems to be the\r\nappropriate receptacle of animal bodies in a disgusting state of\r\nputrefaction.\" At night this charming recreation-ground was illumined by\r\ntwenty-six lamps, at a distance of one hundred and seventy feet from\r\neach other, stuck on wooden poles. Such an account of the grand square\r\nof Dublin does not make one surprised to learn that the main approach to\r\nit from the heart of the city was of a very miserable description.\r\n\r\nIn reading Whitelaw's history of Dublin it is impossible not to be\r\nstruck with the fact that it records a degree of neglect and\r\nindifference on the part of the people and the local authorities to\r\nbeauty, decency and order such as could scarcely be found in another\r\ncountry. In the centre of Merrion Square was a fountain of very\r\nambitious expense and design, erected to the honor of the duke and\r\nduchess of Rutland, a lord and lady lieutenant. The fountain was only\r\nfinished in 1791, but \"from a fault in the foundation, or some shameful\r\nnegligence in the construction, is already cracked and bulged in several\r\nplaces; and though intended as a monument to perpetuate the memory of an\r\nillustrious nobleman and his heroic father (the famous Lord Granby), is,\r\nafter an existence of only sixteen years, tottering to its fall.\" Mr.\r\nWhitelaw continues: \"Unhappily, _a savage barbarism that seems hostile\r\nto every idea of order or decency, of beauty and elegance, prevails\r\namong but too many of the lower orders_; and hence the decorations of\r\nalmost every public fountain have been destroyed or disfigured: the\r\nfigure, shamefully mutilated, of the water-nymph in this fountain has\r\nbeen reduced to a disgusting trunk, and the _alto relievo_ over it shows\r\nequal symptoms of decay, arising partly from violence, and partly,\r\nperhaps, from the perishable nature of the materials.\" Truly a forcible\r\npicture of art and the appreciation thereof in Ireland!\r\n\r\nDuring the last century some Italians came to Dublin, who left their\r\nmark upon the interior decorations of rich men's houses. Many of the old\r\nhouses retain the beautiful mantelpieces designed and executed by these\r\naccomplished artists. A leading house-fitter of Dublin has, however,\r\nbought up a good many, and they are finding their way to London, where\r\nit is to be hoped they may produce a revolution in taste, for London\r\nmantelpieces are, as a rule, hideous. Some of these specimens of art\r\nhave been bought by wealthy Irishmen and transferred to their\r\ncountry-houses. One nobleman, Lord Langford, whose ancestral home was\r\nwrecked in the rebellion of 1798, has lately been restoring it, and\r\nbought up many of the Dublin mantelpieces.\r\n\r\nThe ornamentation of Belvedere House, in Gardener Row, is particularly\r\nelaborate and in wonderfully good repair.\r\n\r\nIrish family history contains few sadder stories than that of the first\r\ncountess of Belvedere. Lord Belvedere was a man of fashion who much\r\nfrequented St. James's, and indeed owed his elevation, first to a barony\r\nand then to an earldom, to the favor of that highly uninteresting\r\nmonarch, George II. Leaving his wife sometimes for long periods at\r\nGaulston, a vast and dreary residence (since pulled down) in Westmeath,\r\nhe betook himself to London, and Lady Belvedere at such times lived much\r\nwith her husband's brother, Mr. Arthur Rochfort, and his family. It is\r\nsaid that some woman with whom Lord Belvedere had long been connected\r\nwas determined to make mischief between him and his wife. Eight years\r\nafter their marriage, Lady Belvedere was accused of adultery with Mr.\r\nRochfort: in an action of _crim. con._ damages to the extent of twenty\r\nthousand pounds were given, and the defendant was obliged to fly the\r\ncountry. For many years he lived abroad, but at length ventured to\r\nreturn, when his brother caused him to be arrested, and he died in\r\nconfinement, protesting to the last, as did Lady Belvedere, his\r\ninnocence. For Lady Belvedere a terrible punishment for her alleged\r\nmisdeeds was in store. Her husband quitted Gaulston for a cheerful\r\nretreat in another part of the county, and henceforth that gloomy\r\nmansion became the prison-house of the unhappy countess.\r\n\r\nWhen her imprisonment commenced Lady Belvedere was twenty-five. For\r\neighteen years she remained a prisoner. Her husband often visited\r\nGaulston, but uniformly avoided all personal communication with her.\r\nOnce she succeeded in speaking to him, but her entreaties were in vain,\r\nand thenceforward, whenever he was about the grounds at Gaulston, the\r\nattendant accompanying Lady Belvedere in her walks was instructed to\r\nring a bell to give warning of her approach. At length, after twelve\r\nyears of captivity, Lady Belvedere contrived to escape, but Lord\r\nBelvedere, who had been apprised of the fact, reached her father's house\r\nin Dublin before her, and she found that his representations had weighed\r\nso strongly with Lord Molesworth--who had married a second time--that\r\norders had been given that she was not to be admitted. She then took a\r\nvery unfortunate step by repairing to the house of her friends, the wife\r\nand family of the brother-in-law with whom she had been accused of being\r\nguilty of misconduct, Mr. Rochfort himself being in exile. She was\r\npresently seized and reconveyed to Gaulston, where a much more rigorous\r\ntreatment was henceforth pursued toward her. At length her husband's\r\ndeath set her free.\r\n\r\nLady Belvedere passed the rest of her days in peace and comfort at the\r\nhouse of her daughter and son-in-law, Lord and Lady Lanesborough. She\r\ndid not long survive her husband, and on her deathbed, after partaking\r\nof the holy communion, affirmed with a most solemn oath her perfect\r\ninnocence of the crime for which she had suffered so much.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps in many respects Charlemont House has the most interesting\r\nrecollections connected with it of all the _grand-seigneur_ mansions of\r\nthe Irish metropolis. It was here that the first earl of Charlemont,\r\nthe best specimen of a nobleman that Ireland has to boast of, passed the\r\ngreater portion of his later life. Lord Charlemont's name is to be found\r\nin all the memoirs of eminent political and literary men of his time. He\r\nwas the friend of Burke and Johnson, a popular member of _the_ club, and\r\na munificent patron of literature and art. But more than all this, he\r\nstuck bravely to his country, and to no man in Ireland did the Stopford\r\nmotto, _Patriæ infelici fidelis_, more correctly apply. Had more of his\r\norder been like him, what a different country might Ireland have been!\r\n\r\nI found Charlemont House full of painters and glaziers. The mansion,\r\nwhich was retained _in statu quo_ by the late earl, although, for fifty\r\nyears no member of the family had slept there, has now been sold to the\r\ngovernment, and is being prepared for the accommodation of the survey\r\ndepartment. The mouldings of the beautiful ceilings are still extant in\r\nsome of the rooms, although what once was gilt is now white-wash. The\r\nlibrary is much as it was, minus the very valuable collection of books,\r\nwhich were sold some time since by the present earl, and fetched a large\r\nsum, albeit many of the most valuable were destroyed in a fire which\r\nbroke out at the auctioneer's where they were deposited in London.[3]\r\n\r\nWith his friend Edmund Burke, Lord Charlemont maintained a close\r\ncorrespondence. One of Burke's published letters relates to an American\r\ngentleman, Mr. Shippen, whom he was introducing to the hospitalities of\r\nCharlemont House, and whom he describes as very agreeable, sensible and\r\naccomplished. \"America and we,\" he concludes, \"are not under the same\r\ncrown, but if we are united by mutual good-will and reciprocal good\r\noffices, perhaps it may do almost as well. Mr. Shippen will give you no\r\nunfavorable specimen of the New World.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the last century Henrietta street,[4] on the north\r\nbank of the Liffey, was the residence of many of the leading members of\r\nthe aristocracy. The street is a _cul-de-sac_, with the King's Inn (the\r\nTemple and Lincoln's Inn of Dublin) at the farther end. The houses are\r\nextremely spacious and richly ornamented; in fact, far finer in point of\r\nproportion and design than ordinary London houses of the first class.\r\n\r\nThrough the politeness of a gentleman who possesses half the street, I\r\nwent over some of the houses, which are extremely spacious, and contain\r\nbeautifully-proportioned rooms richly ornamented with carving and\r\nmoulding. In what was formerly Mountjoy House I found a dining-room\r\nwhose cornices and ceilings were of the most elegant design and\r\nexecution. This house had seen many curious scenes. It was formerly the\r\ntown-house of the earl of Blessington--whose second title was Viscount\r\nMountjoy--to whom the whole street belonged. The founder of this family,\r\nLuke Gardiner, rose from a humble origin by energy and intrigue, and his\r\nson married the heiress of the Mountjoys. It was occupied up to 1830 by\r\nthe last earl of Blessington, husband of the celebrated literary star.\r\nSoon after their marriage Lady Blessington accompanied her husband to\r\nIreland, and he invited some of his friends who were ignorant of the\r\nevent to dine at his house in Henrietta street. These latter were\r\nsomewhat startled when he entered the room with a beautiful woman\r\nleaning on his arm whom he introduced as his wife. Among the guests was\r\na gentleman who had been in that room only four years before, when the\r\nwalls were hung with black, and in the centre, on an elevated platform,\r\nwas placed a coffin with a gorgeous velvet pall, with the remains in it\r\nof a woman once scarcely surpassed in loveliness by the lady then\r\npresent in bridal costume. This was the first Lady Blessington.\r\n\r\nThe last of the Irish noblesse in this street was Lady Harriet, widow of\r\nthe Right Hon. Denis Bowes-Daly, on whom Grattan passed such warm\r\neulogies, and who was the original of Lever's happiest creation, _The\r\nKnight of Gwynne_.\r\n\r\nIt has been a frequent subject of conjecture why the Phoenix Park was so\r\ncalled. The best explanation seems to be that on a site within its\r\nboundaries there formerly stood, close to a remarkable spring of water,\r\nan ancient manor-house. The manor was called Fionn-uisge, pronounced\r\n_finniské_, which signifies clear or fair water, and this term easily\r\nbecame corrupted into Phoenix. The land became Crown property in 1559,\r\nand was made into a park in 1662. It was immensely improved and put into\r\nits present shape by the earl of Chesterfield, author of the\r\n_Letters_--one of the best viceroys Ireland ever had--about 1743. The\r\narea is seventeen hundred and sixty acres. With the exception of Windsor\r\nand our own Fairmount, no public park in the world can compare with it.\r\nThe ground undulates charmingly, the views are extensive and beautiful.\r\n\r\nGrouped around the Phoenix Park are many beautiful seats: the finest is\r\nWoodlands. This belonged formerly to the Luttrells, a notorious family,\r\nthe head of which was raised to the Irish peerage as earl of Carhampton.\r\nIt was with a Lord Carhampton that his son declined to fight a duel, not\r\nat all because he was his father, but because he \"did not consider him a\r\ngentleman.\" Early in the century, Woodlands, then known as\r\nLuttrellstown, became the property of Luke White, one of the most\r\nremarkable men that Ireland has produced. In 1778, Luke White was in the\r\nhabit of buying cheap odds and ends of literature from a bookseller,\r\nnamed Warren, in Belfast to peddle about the country. In 1798 he loaned\r\nthe Irish government, then in great difficulty, a million of pounds! Mr.\r\nWarren, who found him very punctual and exact, used to permit him to\r\nleave his pack behind his counter and call for it in the morning. No one\r\nwould then have dreamed that the greasy bag was to lead to such results.\r\nBy degrees, White scraped together some means. He used to take odd\r\nvolumes to a binder in Belfast and employ him to get the \"vol.\" at the\r\nbeginning and end of an odd volume erased, so as to pass it off among\r\nthe unwary as a perfect book, and generally furbish it up. Then he used\r\nto sell his literary wares by auction in the streets of Belfast. The\r\nknowledge he thus acquired of public sales procured him a clerkship with\r\na Dublin auctioneer. He opened first a book-stall, and then a regular\r\nbook-shop, in Dawson street, a leading thoroughfare of Dublin. There he\r\nbecame eminent. He sold lottery-tickets, speculated in the funds and\r\ncontracted for government loans. In 1798, when the rebellion broke out,\r\nthe Irish government was desperately in need of funds. They came into\r\nthe Dublin market for a loan of a million, and the best terms they could\r\nget were from Luke White, who offered to take it at sixty-five pounds\r\nper one hundred pound share at five per cent.--not unremunerative terms.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his death, in 1824, he had long been M.P. for Leitrim,\r\nand his son was member for the county of Dublin. He left property worth\r\na hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars a year. Eventually almost\r\nthe whole of it devolved on his fourth son, who some years ago was\r\ncreated a peer of the United Kingdom as Lord Annaly.\r\n\r\nThe family has probably spent more than a million and a half of dollars\r\non elections. It has always been on the Liberal side. The present peer\r\nhas property in about a dozen counties, and is lord-lieutenant of\r\nLangford, whilst his younger son holds the same high office in Clare.\r\n\r\nThe University of Dublin consists of a single college--Trinity. This\r\nedifice forms a prominent feature in the Irish metropolis. It stands in\r\nCollege Green, almost opposite to the Bank of Ireland, the former\r\nlegislative chambers. Since the Union, Trinity College has been but\r\nlittle resorted to by men of the upper ranks of Irish society, although\r\nit has certainly contributed some very eminent men to the public\r\nservice--notably, the late unfortunate governor-general, Lord Mayo, and\r\nLord Cairns, ex-lord-chancellor of England. Trinity is one of the\r\nlargest owners of real estate in the country. The fellowships are far\r\nbetter than those of the English universities. The provost, who occupies\r\na large and stately mansion, has a separate estate worth some fifteen\r\nthousand dollars a year, which he manages himself.\r\n\r\nTrinity has a very fine library. It is one of the five which by an act\r\nof Parliament has a right to demand from the publisher a copy of every\r\nwork published. The origin of the library is quite unique. It dates from\r\na benefaction by the victorious English army after its defeat of the\r\nSpaniards at Kinsale in 1603, when they devoted one thousand eight\r\nhundred pounds--a sum equivalent to five times that money at present\r\nrates--to establish a library in the university, being, it may be\r\npresumed, instigated by some eminent personage, who suggested that such\r\na course would be acceptable to the queen, who had founded the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nDr. Chaloner and Mr. (afterward Archbishop) Ussher were appointed\r\ntrustees of this donation; \"and,\" says Dr. Parr, \"it is somewhat\r\nremarkable that at this time, when the said persons were in London about\r\nlaying out this money in books, they there met Sir Thomas Bodley, then\r\nbuying books for his newly-erected library in Oxford; so that there\r\nbegan a correspondence between them upon this occasion, helping each\r\nother to procure the choicest and best books on moral subjects that\r\ncould be gotten; so that the famous Bodleian Library at Oxford and that\r\nof Dublin began together.\"\r\n\r\nThe private collection of Ussher himself, consisting of ten thousand\r\nvolumes, was the first considerable donation which the library\r\nreceived, and for this also, curiously enough, it was again indebted to\r\nthe English army. In 1640, Ussher left Ireland. The insurgents soon\r\nafter destroyed all his effects with the exception of his books, which\r\nwere secured and sent to London. In 1642--when the troubles between King\r\nand Parliament had broken out--Ussher was nominated one of the\r\nWestminster Assembly of Divines, but having offended the parliamentary\r\nauthorities by refusing to attend, his library was confiscated as that\r\nof a delinquent by order of the House of Commons. However, his friend,\r\nthe celebrated John Selden, got leave to buy the books, as though for\r\nhimself, but really to restore them to Ussher. Narrow circumstances\r\nsubsequently caused him to leave the library to his daughter, instead of\r\nto Trinity. Cardinal Mazarin and the king of Denmark made offers for it,\r\nbut Cromwell interfered to prevent their acceptance. Soon after, the\r\nofficers and, soldiers of Cromwell's army then in Ireland, wishing to\r\nemulate those of Elizabeth, purchased the whole library, together with\r\nall the archbishop's very valuable manuscripts and a choice collection\r\nof coins, for the purpose of presenting them to the college. But when\r\nthese articles were brought over to Ireland, Cromwell refused to permit\r\nthe intentions of the donors to be carried into effect, alleging that he\r\nintended to found a new college, in which the collection might more\r\nconveniently be preserved separate from all other books. The library was\r\ntherefore deposited in Dublin Castle, and so neglected that a great\r\nnumber of valuable books and manuscripts were stolen or destroyed. At\r\nthe Restoration, Charles II. ordered that what remained of the primate's\r\nlibrary should be given to the university, as originally intended.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary persons who ever occupied the position of\r\nprovost, or indeed any position, was John Hely Hutchinson. He was a man\r\nof great ability, and perfectly determined to succeed, without being\r\ntroubled with any very tiresome qualms as to the means he employed in\r\nthe process. Such an officeholder as this man the world probably never\r\nsaw. He was at the same time reversionary principal secretary of state\r\nfor Ireland, a privy councilor, M.P. for Cork, provost of Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, major of the fourth regiment of horse, and searcher of\r\nthe port of Strangford. When he was appointed provost--a situation\r\nalways filled since the foundation by a bachelor--there was great\r\nindignation amongst the fellows, and to appease them he ultimately\r\nprocured a decree permitting them to marry--a privilege which they,\r\nunlike their brethren at Oxford and Cambridge, enjoy to this day. His\r\nposition as provost did not prevent his righting a duel with a Mr.\r\nDoyle, but neither was hurt. Mr. Hutchinson had a great dislike to a Mr.\r\nShrewbridge, one of the junior fellows, who had shown opposition to him.\r\nMr. Shrewbridge died, and the under--graduates attributed his death to\r\nthe provost's having refused him permission to go away for change of\r\nair. A thoroughly Hiber-man _émeute_ was the consequence. The provost\r\nordered that the great bell, which usually tolls for a fellow, should\r\nnot toll, and that the body should be privately buried at six A.M. in\r\nthe fellows' burial-ground. The students immediately posted up placards\r\nthat the great bell _should_ toll, and that the funeral should be by\r\ntorchlight. They carried the point. Almost all the students attended the\r\ncorpse to the grave in scarfs and hatbands at their own expense, and\r\nwhen the funeral oration was pronounced they flew in wild excitement to\r\nthe provost's house, burst open his doors and smashed the furniture to\r\npieces. The provost had a hint given him, and with his family had\r\nretreated to his house near Dublin. It was subsequently stated on good\r\nauthority that Mr. Shrewbridge could not in any case have recovered.\r\n\r\nAny one who takes an interest in the most original writer--not to say,\r\nman--of the eighteenth century will not fail to find his way to \"the\r\nLiberties,\" as that queer district is called which surrounds St.\r\nPatrick's Cathedral. Some years ago the present writer made his way into\r\nthe great deserted deanery--the then dean resided in another part of\r\nthe city--got the old woman in charge of the house to open the shutters\r\nof the dining-room, and gazed at the original portrait of Jonathan\r\nSwift, which hangs there an heirloom to his successors. Of the precincts\r\nof his cathedral he writes to Pope: \"I am lord-mayor of one hundred and\r\ntwenty houses,[5] I am absolute lord of the greatest cathedral in the\r\nkingdom, and am at peace with the neighboring princes--_i.e._, the\r\nlord-mayor of the city and the archbishop of Dublin--but the latter\r\nsometimes attempts encroachments on my dominions, as old Lewis did in\r\nLorraine.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he writes to Dr. Sheridan: \"No soul has broken his neck or is\r\nhanged or married; only Cancerina is dead.[6] I let her go to her grave\r\nwithout a coffin and without fees.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick's, which was, in a deplorable state during Swift's deanship,\r\nand indeed for a century after, is now restored to its original\r\nmagnificence. Indeed, it may be doubted whether it is not in a condition\r\nsuperior to what it ever was. This superb work has been effected\r\nentirely by the princely munificence of the Guinness family, the great\r\n_stout_ brewers of Dublin; and Mr. Roe, a wealthy distiller, is now\r\nengaged in the work of restoring Christ Church, the other Protestant\r\ncathedral.\r\n\r\nI paid a visit to the Bank of Ireland, the edifice on which the hopes of\r\nso many patriotic Irishmen have been centred, insomuch as it is the old\r\nParliament-house. The elderly official who conducted us over the\r\nbuilding took us first through the bank-note manufacturing rooms, where\r\nwe espied in a corner a queer wooden figure draped in a queerer\r\nuniform. Demanding its history, he said that the clothes had belonged to\r\nan old servant of the establishment, and were discovered after his\r\ndecease a few years ago. Formerly the Bank of Ireland was guarded by a\r\nspecial corps of its own, and the ancient retainer, who had been a\r\nmember of this very commercial regiment, was proud of it, and had kept\r\nhis dress as a cherished memorial. When George IV. came to Ireland, on\r\nhis celebrated popularity-hunt, in 1821--previous to which no English\r\nmonarch had visited Ireland since William III.--he graciously\r\ncondescended to give the bank a military guard, which has since been\r\ncontinued. On the day I went I found a number of soldiers of the Scots\r\nFusileer Guards occupying the guard-room. The officer on duty receives\r\nan allowance of two dollars and a half for his dinner. At the Bank of\r\nEngland he gets instead a dinner for himself and a friend, and a couple\r\nof bottles of wine.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the Parliament-house is almost the same as when Ireland\r\nhad her own separate legislature. The House of Lords is in precisely the\r\ncondition in which it was left in 1801. It is a large oak-paneled,\r\noblong chamber of no particular beauty, and might very well pass for the\r\ndining-hall of a London guild. There is a handsome fireplace, and the\r\nwalls are in great part covered with two fine pieces of tapestry\r\nrepresenting the battle of the Boyne and the siege of Derry, King\r\nWilliam, \"of glorious, pious and immortal,\" etc., being of course the\r\nmost conspicuous object in the foreground. The attendant stated that a\r\nspecial clause in the lease of the buildings, to the Bank of Ireland\r\nCompany stipulated that the House of Lords was to remain _in statu quo_.\r\nPerhaps it may return some of these days to its former use. The House of\r\nCommons, a large stone hall of stately dimensions, is now the\r\ncash-office of the bank. There seemed nothing about it architecturally\r\nto call for special notice. I mooted the probability of the Parliament\r\nbeing restored, but found, rather to my surprise, that the attendant\r\nwas by no means disposed to regard such a step with unqualified\r\napproval. It would be a blessing if the country was fit to govern\r\nitself, he said, or words to that effect, but looking at the religious\r\ndissension and political bitterness existing in the country, he feared\r\nthat it wouldn't do yet a while; and I suspect he's right. Ireland is a\r\nhouse divided against itself: fifty years hence it may resemble\r\nScotland. Meanwhile, there is no doubt whatever that a measure giving\r\nboth Ireland and Scotland something in the nature of State legislatures\r\nwould find favor with many English M.P.s, who greatly grudge having the\r\nvaluable time of the imperial legislature wasted over a gas-bill in\r\nTipperary or a water-works scheme for Dundee. The bank seemed to me to\r\nbe guarded with extraordinary care. I went all over the roof, on which a\r\nguard is mounted at night. At \"coigns of vantage\" there is a\r\nbullet-proof palisading, with peepholes through which a volley of\r\nmusketry might be poured. I should fancy that extra precautions have\r\nprobably been taken since the Fenian _émeutes_ of the last ten years.\r\n\r\nDublin swarms with soldiers, constabulary and police. The metropolitan\r\npolice is divided into six divisions, each two hundred strong. Its men\r\nare, I believe, beyond a doubt the very finest in the world in point of\r\nphysique. Numbers of them are six feet two or three inches high, and\r\nthey are broad and athletic in proportion. Indeed, the magnificence of\r\nsome of them who are detached for duty at certain \"great confluences of\r\nhuman existence\" is such that you see strangers standing and gaping at\r\nthe giants in sheer amazement. The metropolitan police is quite distinct\r\nfrom the constabulary, and under a different chief.\r\n\r\nOutside the bank, in College Green, is the celebrated statue of William\r\nIII. Its location has been more than once changed, and it is now placed\r\nwhere the officer on guard at the bank can keep an eye upon it. This\r\nfearful object, which would make a Pradier or Chantrey shudder, is\r\npainted and gilt annually. It has long served as a bone of contention\r\nbetween Protestant and Papist, and has come off very badly several times\r\nat the hands of the latter--a circumstance which probably accounts for\r\none of the horse's legs being about a foot longer than the rest--half of\r\nthat limb having been renewed after it had been lost in one of the many\r\nfree fights in which this remarkable quadruped has seen service. The\r\ngreatest proprietor of real estate in Dublin is the young earl of\r\nPembroke, son of the late Right Hon. Sidney Herbert, so well known in\r\nconnection with the Crimean war, who was created, shortly before his\r\ndeath, Lord Herbert of Lea. His estate, which is the most valuable in\r\nIreland, comprises Merrion Square and all the most fashionable part of\r\nthe Irish metropolis, and extends for several miles along the railway\r\nline running from Kingstown, the landing-place from England, to the\r\ncapital. The property also includes Mount Merrion, a neglected seat\r\nabout four miles from the city. This mansion, which might easily be made\r\ndelightful, commands a charming view over the lovely bay, and is\r\nsurrounded by a small but picturesque park containing deer. It was, with\r\nthe rest of Lord Pembroke's estate, formerly the property of Viscount\r\nFitzwilliam, who founded the Fitzwilliam Museum in the University of\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nLord Fitzwilliam was a somewhat eccentric person. His nearest relation\r\nhad displeased him by some very trivial offence, such as coming down\r\nlate for dinner, so he determined to leave his estate to his distant\r\ncousin, Lord Pembroke. Falling ill, Lord Fitzwilliam, desired that Lord\r\nPembroke might be summoned from London. Word came back that it was\r\nunfortunately impossible for him to leave England immediately. Presently\r\nnews arrived from Dublin that Lord Fitzwilliam was dead, and had\r\nbequeathed all--the property is now three hundred and fifty thousand\r\ndollars a year--to Lord Pembroke, with remainder to his second son. By\r\nthe death of the late Lord Pembroke the English and Irish properties\r\nhave become united, and are to-day worth not less than six hundred\r\nthousand dollars a year! It is this young nobleman who has lately\r\nwritten _The Earl and The Doctor_.\r\n\r\nREGINALD WYNFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Fitzgeralds, of which family the duke of Leinster is\r\nchief, became Protestant in 1611, when George, sixteenth earl of\r\nKildare, coming to the title and estates when eight years old, was given\r\nin ward, according to the custom of the time, to the duke of Lenox (then\r\nlord privy seal), who bred him a Protestant.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In June, 1798, the corpse of Lord Edward Fitzgerald was\r\nconveyed from the jail of Newgate and entombed in St. Werburgh's church,\r\nDublin, until the times would admit of their being removed to the family\r\nvault at Kildare. \"A guard,\" says his brother, \"was to have attended at\r\nNewgate the night of my poor brother's burial, in order to provide\r\nagainst all interruption from the different guards and patrols in the\r\nstreets: it never arrived, which caused the funeral to be several times\r\nstopped on its way, so that the funeral did not take place until nearly\r\ntwo in the morning, and the people attending were obliged to stay in\r\nchurch until a pass could be procured to permit them to go out.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Lord Charlemont had a seat called Marino, beautifully\r\nsituated within a few miles of Dublin.

The\r\nfurniture is just as it was, and although sadly out of repair, the\r\nvisitor can easily judge how exquisite the place must once have been.\r\nThere is a superb mantelpiece, richly mounted in bronze and inlaid with\r\nlapis lazuli.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The occupants of Henrietta street in 1784 included--the\r\nprimate (Lord Rokeby); the earl of Shannon; Hon.

Up to that time nearly all the peers, except those\r\nreally English, seem to have had residences in Dublin.

Alack! who knows?\r\n        Ten sweet, long years of life! I would paint\r\n        Our Lady and many and many a saint,\r\n          And thereby win my soul's repose.\r\n        Yet, Fra Bernardo, you shake your head:\r\n                Has the leech once said\r\n                I must die? But he\r\n        Is only a fallible man, you see:\r\n        Now, if it had been our father the pope,\r\n        I should _know_ there was then no hope.\r\n        Were only I sure of a few kind years\r\n        More to be merry in, then my fears\r\n        I'd slip for a while, and turn and smile\r\n        At their hated reckonings: whence the need\r\n        Of squaring accounts for word and deed\r\n        Till the lease is up?... How? hear I right?\r\n        No, no! You could not have said, _To-night_!\r\n\r\n        II.\r\n\r\n                Ah, well! ah, well!\r\n        \"Confess\"--you tell me--\"and be forgiven.\"\r\n        Is there no easier path to heaven?\r\n          Santa Maria! how can I tell\r\n        What, now for a score of years and more,\r\n          I've buried away in my heart so deep\r\n        That, howso tired I've been, I've kept\r\n        Eyes waking when near me another slept,\r\n          Lest I might mutter it in my sleep?\r\n          And now at the last to blab it clear!\r\n        How the women will shrink from my pictures! And worse\r\n        Will the men do--spit on my name, and curse;\r\n          But then up in heaven I shall not hear.\r\n\r\n                I faint! I faint!\r\n        Quick, Fra Bernardo! The figure stands\r\n          There in the niche--my patron saint:\r\n        Put it within my trembling hands\r\n          Till they are steadier. So!\r\n                My brain\r\n        Whirled and grew dizzy with sudden pain,\r\n        Trying to span that gulf of years,\r\n        Fronting again those long laid fears.\r\n        _Confess_? Why, yes, if I must, I must.\r\n        Now good Sant' Andrea be my trust!\r\n        But fill me first, from that crystal flask,\r\n        Strong wine to strengthen me for my task.\r\n        (That thing is a gem of craftsmanship:\r\n        Just mark how its curvings fit the lip.)\r\n\r\n        Ah, you, in your dreamy, tranquil life,\r\n        How can _you_ fathom the rage and strife,\r\n        The blinding envy, the burning smart,\r\n        That, worm-like, gnaws the Maestro's heart\r\n        When he sees another snatch the prize\r\n        Out from under his very eyes,\r\n          For which he would barter his soul? You see\r\n        I taught him his art from first to last:\r\n          Whatever he was he owed to me.\r\n        And then to be browbeat, overpassed,\r\n        Stealthily jeered behind the hand!\r\n        Why that was more than a saint could stand;\r\n        And I was no saint. And if my soul,\r\n        With a pride like Lucifer's, mocked control,\r\n        And goaded me on to madness, till\r\n        I lost all measure of good or ill,\r\n        Whose gift was it, pray? Oh, many a day\r\n        I've cursed it, yet whose is the blame, I say?\r\n\r\n        _His name_? How strange that you question so,\r\n        When I'm sure I have told it o'er and o'er,\r\n        And why should you care to hear it more?\r\n\r\n        III.\r\n\r\n        Well, as I was saying, Domenico\r\n        Was wont of my skill to make such light,\r\n        That, seeing him go on a certain night\r\n        Out with his lute, I followed. Hot\r\n        From a war of words, I heeded not\r\n          Whither I went, till I heard him twang\r\n        A madrigal under the lattice where\r\n          Only the night before I sang.\r\n        --A double robbery! and I swear\r\n        'Twas overmuch for the flesh to bear.\r\n\r\n        _Don't ask me_. I knew not what I did,\r\n        But I hastened home with my rapier hid\r\n        Under my cloak, and the blade was wet.\r\n          Just open that cabinet there and see\r\n        The strange red rustiness on it yet.\r\n\r\n        A calm that was dead as dead could be\r\n        Numbed me: I seized my chalks to trace--\r\n        What think you?--_Judas Iscariot's face_!\r\n        I just had finished the scowl, no more,\r\n        When the shuffle of feet drew near my door\r\n          (We lived together, you know I said):\r\n        Then wide they flung it, and on the floor\r\n          Laid down Domenico--dead!\r\n\r\n        Back swam my senses: a sickening pain\r\n        Tingled like lightning through my brain,\r\n        And ere the spasm of fear was broke,\r\n        The men who had borne him homeward spoke\r\n        Soothingly: \"Some assassin's knife\r\n        Had taken the innocent artist's life--\r\n        Wherefore, 'twere hard to say: all men\r\n        Were prone to have troubles now and then\r\n        The world knew naught of. Toward his friend\r\n        Florence stood waiting to extend\r\n        Tenderest dole.\" Then came my tears,\r\n        And I've been sorry these twenty years.\r\n\r\n        Now, Fra Bernardo, you have my sin:\r\n        Do you think Saint Peter will let me in?\r\n\r\nMARGARET J. PRESTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONSIEUR FOURNIER'S EXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\n\"_La transfusion parait avoir eu quelque succes dans ces derniers\r\ntemps_.\"\r\n\r\nA dejected man, M. le docteur Maurice Fournier locked the door of his\r\nphysiological laboratory in the Place de l'École de Médecine, and walked\r\naway toward his rooms in the rue Rossini. At two-and-thirty, rich,\r\nbrilliant, an ambitious graduate of l'École de Médecine, an enthusiastic\r\npupil of Claude Bernard's, a devoted lover of science, and above all of\r\nphysiology, yesterday he was without a care save to make his name great\r\namong the great names of science--to win for himself a place in the\r\nforemost rank of the followers of that mistress whom only he loved and\r\nworshiped. To-day a word had swept away all his fondest hopes.\r\nTrousseau, the keenest observer in all Paris, formerly his father's\r\nfriend, now no less his own, had kindly but firmly called his attention\r\nto himself, and to the malady that had so imperceptibly and insidiously\r\nfastened itself upon him that until the moment he never dreamed of its\r\napproach. He had been too full of his work to think of himself. In any\r\nother case he would scarcely have dared to dispute the opinion of the\r\nhighest medical authority in Europe; nevertheless in his own he began to\r\nargue the matter: \"But, my dear doctor, I am well.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my friend, you are not. You are thin and pale, and I noticed the\r\nother night, when you came late to the meeting of the Institute, that\r\nyour breathing was quick and labored, and that the reading of your\r\nexcellent paper was frequently interrupted by a short cough.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was nothing. I was hurried and excited, and I have been keeping\r\nmyself too closely to my work. A run to Dunkerque, a week of rest and\r\nsea-air, will make all right again.\"\r\n\r\nBut the great man shook his head gravely: \"Not weeks, but years, of a\r\ndifferent life are needed. You must give up the laboratory altogether if\r\nyou want to live. Remember your mother's fate and your father's early\r\ndeath--think of the deadly blight that fell so soon upon the rare beauty\r\nof your sister. Some day you will realize your danger: realize it now,\r\nin time. Close your laboratory, lock up your library, say adieu to\r\nParis, and lead the life of a traveler, an Arab, a Tartar. For the\r\npresent cease to dream of the future: strength is better than a\r\nprofessorship in the College of France, and health more than the cross\r\nof the Legion of Honor.\"\r\n\r\nFournier was at first surprised and incredulous: he became convinced,\r\nthen alarmed. After some thought he was horribly dejected. At such a\r\ntime an Englishman becomes stolid, a German gives up utterly, an\r\nAmerican begins to live fast, since he may not live long; but he, being\r\na Frenchman and a Parisian, had alternations--first, the idea of\r\nsuicide, which means sleep; second, reaction, which is hopefulness.\r\n\r\nHe chose to react, and did it promptly. A little time, and the rooms in\r\nthe Place de l'École de Médecine, opposite the bookseller's, displayed a\r\ncard stuck on the entrance-door with red wafers, \"_à louer_,\" the hammer\r\nof the auctioneer knocked down the comfortable furniture of the\r\napartments in the rue Rossini, while that of the carpenter nailed up the\r\nwell-beloved books in stout boxes, and the places that had known M. le\r\ndocteur knew him no more. None but those who have experienced the\r\npleasures of a life devoted to scientific research can understand how\r\nhard all this was to him. The fulfillment of long-cherished desires, the\r\ncompletion of elaborate systematic investigations, the realization of\r\npet theories, the establishment of new principles,--all, all abandoned\r\nafter so much toil and care. To struggle painfully through a desert\r\ntoward some beautiful height, which, at first dimly seen, has grown\r\nclearer and clearer and always more splendid as he advances, and now at\r\nits very foot to be turned back by a gloomy stream in whose depths lurks\r\ndeath itself; to reach out his hand to the golden truth, fruit of much\r\nwinnowing of human knowledge, and as he grasps the precious grains to be\r\nborne back by a grim spectre whose very breath is horrible with the\r\nnoisome odors of the tomb; to choose an arduous life, and learn to love\r\nit because it has high aims, and then to give it up at once and\r\nutterly!--alas, poor Fournier!\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" he said as he turned his back on Paris, \"even idle\r\nwanderings are better than dying of consumption.\"\r\n\r\nBehold the student of science a wanderer--sailing his yacht among the\r\nislands of the Mediterranean; making long journeys through the wild\r\nmountain-regions and lovely valleys of untraveled Spain; stemming the\r\nhistoric current of the Nile; among the nomad tribes, in Arab costume\r\nriding an Arabian mare, as wild an Arab as the wildest of them; killing\r\ntigers in India, tending stock in Australia, chasing buffaloes in\r\nWestern America,--everywhere avoiding civilization and courting Nature\r\nand the company of men who either by birth or adoption were the children\r\nof Nature. By day the winds of heaven kissed his cheeks and the sun\r\nbronzed them: at night he often fell asleep wondering at the star-worlds\r\nthat gemmed the only canopy over his welcome blanket-couch.\r\n\r\nHis treatment of consumption was certainly a rational one, and perhaps\r\nthe only one that is ever wholly successful. But, alas! few can take so\r\ncostly a prescription.\r\n\r\nHow often had his studies led him to dissect the bodies of animals that\r\nhad died in their dens in the Jardin des Plantes! Often in the first\r\ngeneration of cage-life, almost always in the second, invariably in the\r\nthird, they grow dull, listless, the fire goes out of their eyes, the\r\nlitheness out of their limbs: they forget to eat, they cough, and soon\r\nthey die. Of what? Consumption. Once our fathers were wild and lived in\r\nthe open air: they scarcely ever died, as we do, of consumption.\r\nCrowded cities, bad drainage, overwork, want of healthful exercise,\r\nstimulating food, dissipation,--these are human cage-life. If a man is\r\nthreatened with consumption, let him go back to the plains and forests\r\nbefore it is too late.\r\n\r\nCertainly the treatment benefited Fournier. By and by it did more--it\r\ncured him. The cough was forgotten, the cheeks filled out, the muscles\r\nbecame hard as bundles of steel wire, his strength was prodigious: he\r\nate his food with a relish unknown in Paris, and slept like a child.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, his mind, trained to habits of thought and observation,\r\nwas not idle. When a city was his home he had been a physiologist and\r\nhad studied _man_: he made the world his dwelling-place, and wandering\r\namong the nations he became an ethnologist and began to study _men_.\r\n\r\nA distinguished professor, writing of the influence of climate upon man,\r\nfor the sake of illustration supposes the case of a human being whose\r\nlife should be prolonged through many ages, and who should pass that\r\nlife in journeying slowly from the arctic regions southward through the\r\nvarying climates of the earth to the eternal winter of the antarctic\r\nzone. Always preserving his personal identity, this traveler would\r\nundergo remarkable changes in form, feature and complexion, in habits\r\nand modes of life, and in mental and moral attributes. Though he might\r\nhave been perfectly white at first, his skin would pass through every\r\ndegree of darkness until he reached the equator, when it would be black.\r\nProceeding onward, he would gradually become fairer, and on reaching the\r\nend of his journey he would again be pale. His intellectual powers would\r\nvary also, and with them the shape of his skull. His forehead, low and\r\nretreating, would by degrees assume a nobler form as he advanced to more\r\ngenial climes, the facial angle reaching its maximum in the temperate\r\nzone, only to gradually diminish as he journeyed toward the torrid, and\r\nto again exhibit under the equator its original base development. As he\r\ncontinued his journey toward the south pole he would undergo a second\r\ntime this series of progressing and retrograding changes, until at\r\nlength, as he laid his weary bones to rest in some icy cave in the drear\r\nantarctics,\r\n\r\n    Multum ille et terris jactatus et alto,\r\n\r\nhe would be in every respect, save in age and a ripe experience, the\r\nsame as at the outset of his wanderings.\r\n\r\nExtravagant as this illustration may appear, the professor goes on to\r\nsay, philosophically, on the doctrine of the unity of the human race, it\r\nis not so; for what else than such an imaginary prolonged individual\r\nlife is the life of the race? And what greater changes have occurred to\r\nour imaginary traveler than have actually befallen the human family?\r\n\r\nThe facts are patent. Under the equator is found the negro, in the\r\ntemperate zones the Indo-European, and toward the pole the Lapp and\r\nEsquimaux. They are as different as the climates in which they dwell;\r\nnevertheless, history, philology, the common traditions of the race,\r\nrevelation, point to their brotherhood.\r\n\r\nHow is it that climate can bring about such modifications in man? Is it\r\npossible that the sun, shining upon his face and his children's faces\r\nfor ages, can make their skin dark, and their hair crisp and curly, and\r\ntheir foreheads low? Or that sunshine and shadow, spring-time and\r\nautumn, summer's showers beating upon him and winter's snows falling\r\nabout his path, can make him fair and free? Or that the dreary night and\r\ncheerless day of many changeless arctic years can make him short and fat\r\nand stolid as a seal? Surely not. These avail much; but other\r\ninfluences, indirect and obscure in their workings, but not the less\r\nessentially climatic, are required. Food, raiment, shelter, occupation,\r\namusement, influences that tell upon the very citadel and stronghold of\r\nlife--and all in their very nature climatic, since they are controlled\r\nand modified by climate--are the means by which such changes are\r\neffected. The savage living in the open air, not trammeled with much\r\nclothing, anointing his skin with oil, eating uncooked food, delighting\r\nin the chase and in battle, and living thus because his surroundings\r\nindicate it, becomes swart and athletic, fierce, cunning and\r\ncruel--takes ethnologically the lowest place. Of literature, science,\r\nart, he knows nothing: for him will is justice, fear law, some miserable\r\nfetich God. Still, in his nature lie dormant all the capabilities of the\r\nnoblest manhood, awaiting only favorable surroundings to call them into\r\nglorious being. It might shock the salt of the earth to reflect that\r\nsome centuries of life among them and their fair descendants would make\r\nhim like them.\r\n\r\nThe arctic savage clad in furs and eating blubber does not differ\r\nessentially from his brother of the tropics. So much of his food is\r\nnecessarily converted into heat that he cannot afford to lead so active\r\na life; but he also, like him of the tropics, partakes with his\r\nsurroundings in color. The one, living amid snowclad scenery, where the\r\nsparse vegetation is gray and grayish-green, and the birds and animals\r\nalmost as white as the snow over which they wander, is pale, etiolated.\r\nThe other, under a vertical sun, surrounded by a lush and lusty growth,\r\nwhose flowers for variety and intensity of color are beyond description,\r\nand in which birds of brightest plumage and black and tawny beasts make\r\ntheir home, has the most marked supply of pigment--is dark-hued, black,\r\nin short a negro. Between these two extremes is the typical man, fair of\r\nface, with expanded brow and wavy hair, well fed, well clad, well\r\nhoused, wresting from Nature her hidden things and making her mightiest\r\nforces the workers of his will; heaping together knowledge, cherishing\r\nart, reverencing justice, worshiping God. How startling the contrast\r\nbetween brothers!\r\n\r\nSuch changes do not take place in a few generations. For their\r\ncompletion hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years must elapse. The\r\ndescendants of the blacks who were carried from Africa to America as\r\nslaves two centuries and a half ago, save where their color has been\r\nmodified by a mixed parentage, are still black. Already the influence\r\nof new climatic surroundings and of association has wrought great\r\nchanges upon them: they are no longer savages. But their complexion is\r\nas dark as that of their kidnapped forefathers. Their original physical\r\ncondition remains almost unaltered, and with it many mental\r\ncharacteristics: their love of display and of bright colors, their\r\nfondness for tune and the power of music to move them, their weird and\r\nfantastic belief in ghosts and spirits, in signs, omens and charms, and\r\nmany other traits, still bear witness to their savage origin. But even\r\nthese are fading away, and these men are slowly but not the less surely\r\nbecoming civilized and _white_.\r\n\r\nThe point of departure for every structural change in a living organism\r\nlies in the apparatus by which nutrition is maintained; and this in the\r\nhigher classes is the blood. Most complex and wonderful of fluids, it\r\ncontains in unexplained and inscrutable combination salts of iron, lime,\r\nsoda and potassa, with water, oil, albumen, paraglobulin and fibrinogen,\r\nwhich united form fibrine--in fact, at times, some part of everything we\r\neat and all that goes to form our bodies, which it everywhere permeates,\r\nvitalizes and sustains. Borne in countless numbers in its ever-ebbing\r\nand returning streams are little disks, flattened, bi-concave, not\r\nlarger in man than one-three-thousandth of an inch in diameter, called\r\nred corpuscles, whose part it is to carry from the lungs to the tissues\r\npure oxygen, without which the fire called life cannot be sustained, and\r\nback from the tissues to the lungs carbonic acid, one of the products of\r\nthat fire; and larger, yet marvelously small, bodies called leucocytes\r\nor white corpuscles, whose precise origin and use to this day, in spite\r\nof all the labor that has been spent upon their study, remain unknown.\r\nBut that which makes the blood wonderful above all other fluids is its\r\nvitality. Our common expression, \"life's blood,\" is no idle phrase. The\r\nblood is indeed the very throne of life. If its springs are pure and\r\nbountiful, if its currents flow strong and free, muscle, bone and brain\r\ngrow in symmetry and power, and there is cunning to devise and the\r\nstrong right arm to execute. But if it be thin and poor, and its\r\ncirculation feeble and uncertain, the will flags, the mind is weak and\r\nvacillating, the muscles grow puny, and the man becomes an unresisting\r\nprey to disease and circumstance. If it escape through a wound, strength\r\nebbs with it, until at length life itself flows out with the unchecked\r\ncrimson stream. Thus, then, by acting upon the blood, climate has\r\nwrought and is working such changes upon man. But why are\r\nconstantly-acting causes so slow in producing their effects? How is it\r\nthat countless generations must pass away before purely climatic causes,\r\npotent as they are, begin to manifest themselves in physical changes in\r\nthe races of men exposed to them?\r\n\r\nFournier, physiologist, as I have said, by the education of the schools,\r\nbut by the broader education of his travels sociologist and ethnologist,\r\ndevoted himself again to science, and framed this hypothesis: _Climatic\r\ninfluences, acting upon man, bring about physical changes exceedingly\r\nslowly, because they are resisted by an inveterate habit of\r\nassimilation. This habit pertains either to the blood or the tissues,\r\npossibly to both, probably to the blood alone_.\r\n\r\nTo establish an hypothesis experiment is necessary. Physiology is a\r\nscience of experiment. Hence the frequent uncertainty of its results,\r\nsince no two observers conduct an experiment in exactly the same\r\nmanner--certainly no two ever institute it under precisely the same\r\nconditions. Nevertheless, let us not decry science. Out of much\r\nsearching after truth comes the finding of truth--after long groping in\r\ndarkness one comes upon a ray of light.\r\n\r\nAn experiment was necessary. To the ingenious mind of Fournier an\r\nelaborate one occurred. If he could perform it, not only would his\r\nhypothesis be established and confirmed beyond all cavil, but a, field\r\nof scientific research also be opened such as was yet undreamed of.\r\nHowever, for this experiment subjects were needed. Brutes, beasts of the\r\nfield? Not so: that were easy to achieve. Human beings, two living,\r\nhealthy men, one white, one black, were the requirements. Impossible!\r\nThe experiment could never be performed: its requirements were\r\nunattainable. O tempora! O mores! Alas, for the degeneracy of the age!\r\nIn the days of the Roman emperors men were fed, literally fed, to wild\r\nbeasts in the arena--Gauls, Scythians, Nubians, even Roman freedmen when\r\nbarbarians were scarce. This to amuse the populace alone. Frightful\r\nwaste of life! In India, a thousand lives thrown away in a day under the\r\nwheels of Juggernaut; in Europe, tens of thousands to gratify the\r\nimperious wills of grasping monarchs; in America, hundreds to sate the\r\ngreed of railroad corporations. And now not two men to be had for an\r\nexperiment of untold value to science, that would scarcely endanger life\r\nin one of them, and in the other would necessitate only the merest\r\nscratch! To what are we coming? No one complains that tattooed heads are\r\ngoing out of fashion--that the king of the Cannibal Isles no longer\r\nflatters a ship's master by inquiring which head of all his subjects is\r\nornamented most to his fancy, and the next day sending him that head as\r\na souvenir of his visit to the anthropophagic shores. It is well that\r\nthe custom is dead. But is there not danger of drifting too far even\r\ntoward the shore of compassion? May it not be that there is something\r\nwrong with the bowels of mercy when criminals are executed barbarously,\r\nwhile science needs their lives, or at least an insight into the method\r\nof their dying; when precise examination of the manner of nerve and\r\nblood supply to the organs of a superannuated horse is heavily finable;\r\nwhen charitable but perchance too enthusiastic societies for the\r\nprevention of cruelty to animals push their earnestness even to\r\ninterference with scientific researches, because, forsooth! they\r\njeopardize the lives of rabbits, guinea-pigs and dogs? The legend _Cave\r\ncanem_ bears a deeper meaning now than it did in the inlaid pavements\r\nof Pompeian vestibules. We dare not trample it under foot.\r\n\r\nFive years passed, and with restored health back came the old desires in\r\nredoubled force. Fournier longed to return to civilization and to work.\r\nThe life that had been so delightful while it did him good became\r\nutterly unbearable when he had reaped its full benefit. I am tempted to\r\nquote a line about Europe and Cathay, but refrain: it will recur to the\r\nreader. He burned to renew the labors he had abandoned, to take up again\r\nthe work he had laid down to do battle with disease, now that disease\r\nwas vanquished. Thus the year 1863 found him in the city of Charleston,\r\nhomeward bound in his journey around the world.\r\n\r\nWhile still in the wilds west of the Mississippi he could have shaped\r\nhis course northward and readily proceeded directly by steamer from New\r\nYork to Europe. But a determined purpose led him to choose a different\r\ncourse, though he was well aware that it would involve indefinite delay\r\nin reaching Paris, and great personal risk. The life he had been leading\r\nmade him think lightly of danger, and years would be well spent if he\r\ncould accomplish the plans that induced him to go into the disorganized\r\ncountry of the South.\r\n\r\nHe straightway connected himself with the army as surgeon, and solicited\r\na place at the front. He wanted active service. In this he was\r\ndisappointed. Charleston, blockaded and beseiged, was in a state of\r\nmilitary inaction. Save the occasional exchange of shot and shell at\r\nlong range between the works on shore and those which the Unionists had\r\nerected and held upon the neighboring islands and marshes, nothing was\r\ndone, and for nearly a year Fournier experienced the irksomeness of\r\nroutine duty in a wretchedly arranged and appointed military hospital.\r\nNevertheless, the time was not wholly wasted. From a planter fleeing\r\nfrom the anarchy of civil war he procured a native African slave, one of\r\nthe shipload brought over a few years before in the Wanderer, the last\r\nslave-ship that put into an American harbor. This man he made his\r\nbody-servant and kept always near him, partly to study him, but chiefly\r\nto secure his complete mental and moral thraldom. An almost unqualified\r\nsavage, Fournier avoided systematiclly everything that would tend to\r\ncivilize him. He taught him many things that were convenient in his\r\nhigher mode of life, and taught him well, but of the great principles of\r\ncivilization he strove to keep him in ignorance; and more, he so\r\nconfused and distorted the few gleams of light that had reached that\r\ndarkened soul that they made its gloom only the more hideous and\r\nprofound. He wanted a man altogether savage, mentally, morally and\r\nphysically. Instead of teaching him English or French, he learned from\r\nhim many words of his own rude native tongue, and communicated with him\r\nas much as possible in that alone, aided by gesture, in which, like all\r\nFrenchmen, he possessed marvelous facility of expression. In the\r\nunexplored back-country of Africa the negro had been a prince, and\r\nFournier bade him look forward to the time when he would return and\r\nrule. He always addressed him by his African name and title in his own\r\ntongue. He took him into the wards of his hospital, and taught him to be\r\nuseful at surgical operations and to care for the instruments, that he\r\nmight become familiar with them and with the sight of blood, which at\r\nfirst maddened him. Once he gave him a drug that made his head throb,\r\nand then bled him, with almost instant relief. He affected an interest\r\nin the amulets which hung at his neck, and besought him to give him one\r\nto wear. He committed to his care, with expressions of the greatest\r\nsolicitude, a strong box, brass bound and carefully locked, which he\r\ntold him contained his god, a most potent and cruel deity, who would,\r\nhowever, when it pleased him, give back the life of a dead man for\r\n_blood_. This box contained a silver cup, with a thermometer fixed in\r\nits side; a glass syringe holding about a third of a pint; a large\r\ncurved needle perforated in its length like a tube, sharp at one end, at\r\nthe other expanded to fit accurately the nozzle of the syringe; a\r\nlittle strainer also fitting the syringe; and last, a small bundle of\r\nwires with a handle like an egg-beater.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, this savage was crooked, ill-shapen and hideous. His skin\r\nwas as black as night; his head small, the face immensely\r\ndisproportionate to the cranium; his jaws massive and armed with\r\nglittering white teeth filed to points; his cheeks full, his nose flat,\r\nhis eyes little, deep-set, restless, wicked. The usage he received from\r\nhis new master was so different from his former experience with white\r\nmen, and so in accord with his own undisciplined nature, that it called\r\nforth all the sympathies of his character. He soon loved the Frenchman\r\nwith an intensity of affection almost incomprehensible. It is no\r\nexaggeration to say that he would have willingly laid down his life to\r\ngratify his master's slightest wish. The latter's knowledge was to him\r\nso comprehensive, his power so boundless and his will so imperious and\r\ninflexible, that he feared and worshiped him as a god.\r\n\r\nFournier looked upon his monster with satisfaction, and longed for a\r\nbattle. His wish was at last gratified. On the Fourth of July, 1864, an\r\nengagement took place three miles north-west of Legaréville, near the\r\nNorth Edisto River. A force of Union soldiery had been assembled from\r\nthe Sea Islands and from Florida, massed on Seabrook Island, and pushed\r\nthence up into South Carolina. The object of this expedition was\r\nunknown; indeed, as nothing whatever was accomplished, the strategy of\r\nit remains to this day unexplained. However, forewarned is forearmed.\r\nEvery movement was watched and reported by the rebel scouts; all the\r\ntroops that could be spared from Charleston were sent out to oppose the\r\ninvaders; roads were obstructed; bridges were destroyed, batteries\r\nerected in strong positions, everything prepared to impede their\r\nprogress. Our story needs not that we should dwell upon the sufferings\r\nof the Union soldiers on that futile expedition, from the narrow, dusty\r\nroads, the frequent scarcity of water, the intense heat. With infinite\r\nfatigue and peril they advanced only five or six miles in a day's\r\nmarch. Many died of sunstroke, and many fell by the way utterly\r\nexhausted. There was occasional skirmishing; but one actual battle. To\r\nthat the troops gave the name of \"the battle of Bloody Bridge.\" Picture\r\na slightly undulating country covered with thick low forest; a narrow\r\nroad that by an open plank bridge crosses a wide, sluggish stream with\r\nmarshy banks, and curves beyond abruptly to the right to avoid a low,\r\nsteep hill facing the bridge; crowning this hill an earth-work, rude to\r\nbe sure, but steep, sodded, almost impregnable to men without artillery\r\nto play upon it; within, two cannon, for which there is plenty of\r\nammunition, and six hundred Confederate soldiers, fresh, eager,\r\ndetermined; on the road in front of the battery, but just out of range\r\nof its guns, the Union forces halting under arms, the leaders anxious\r\nand discouraged, the men exhausted, careworn, wondering what is to be\r\ndone next, heartily sick of it all, yet willing to do their best; in the\r\nthicket on both sides the road, not sheltered, only covered, within\r\npistol-shot of the enemy, six hundred United States soldiers, a\r\nMassachusetts colored regiment, one of the first recruited, without\r\ncannon, over-marched, overheated, a forlorn hope, _sent forward to take\r\nthe battery_! These men, stealthily assembling there among the trees and\r\nbushes, are ready. Not one of them carries a pound of superfluous\r\nweight. Their rifles with fixed bayonets, a handful of cartridges, a\r\ncanteen of water, are enough. They wear flannel shirts and blue\r\ntrowsers; numbers are bareheaded, some have cut off the sleeves of their\r\nshirts: they know there is work before them. Many kneel in prayer;\r\ncomrades exchange messages to loved ones at home, and give each other\r\nlittle keepsakes--the rings they wore or brier pipes carved over with\r\nthe names of coast battles; others--perhaps they have no loved\r\nones--look to the locks of their pieces and await impatiently the signal\r\nto advance. The officers--white men, most of them Boston society\r\nfellows, old Harvard boys who once thought a six-mile pull or a long\r\ninnings at cricket on a hot day hard work, and knew no more of military\r\ntactics than the Lancers--move about among them, speaking to this one\r\nand to that one, calling each by name, jesting quietly with one,\r\nencouraging another, praising a third, endeavoring to inspire in all a\r\nhope which they dare not feel themselves.\r\n\r\nBut hark! The signal to move. Quickly they form in the road, and with a\r\nshout advance at a run, their dusky faces glistening in that summer sun\r\nand their manly hearts beating bravely in the very jaws of death. Now\r\nthe bridge trembles beneath their steady tread: the foremost are at the\r\nhill, yet no sign of life in the battery. Only the smooth green bank,\r\nthe wretched flag in the distance, and those guns charged with death\r\nlooking grimly down upon them and waiting. On they come, nearer and\r\nnearer, and now some are on the hill and begin to climb the steep that\r\nforms the defence, slowly and with difficulty, using at times their\r\nrifles as aids like alpenstocks. Not a word is spoken. It is hard to\r\nunderstand how so many men can move with so little noise. The silence is\r\nthat which precedes all dreadful noises. It is ominous, terrible.\r\nScarcely twenty feet more, and the foremost will reach the rampart.\r\nHaste! haste! The day is won!\r\n\r\nSuddenly a figure in gray leaps upon the breastwork: he waves his sword,\r\nutters a short quick word of command, and disappears. It is enough. The\r\nsleeping battery awakes. The silence becomes hideous uproar. The smooth\r\ngreen line of the sod against the sky is lined with marksmen, and in an\r\ninstant fringed with fire. Then the cannon bellow and the breezeless air\r\nis dense with smoke. The attacking column hesitates, trembles, makes a\r\nuseless effort to advance, and then falls back beyond the bridge. The\r\nofficers endeavor to rally their men and renew the attack at once, but\r\nin vain: flesh and blood cannot stand in such a storm. Nevertheless, the\r\nbrave fellows--God bless their memory!--halt at length, and form and\r\ncharge once more. And so again and again and again; every time in vain\r\nand with new losses, until at last they cannot rally, but retreat,\r\nbroken and bleeding, to the main body of the expedition, carrying with\r\nthem such of the wounded and dead as they can snatch from under the fire\r\nof the rebel riflemen. Such was the battle of Bloody Bridge, and well\r\nwas it named. Five times that gallant regiment charged the battery, and\r\nwhen the smoke of battle cleared away the sun shone down upon a piteous\r\nsight--blood dyeing the green of that sodded escarp--blood in great\r\nclots upon the rocks and stumps of the rugged hill below--blood poured\r\nplenteously upon the dusty road, making it horrible with purple\r\nmire--blood staining the bridge and gathering in little pools upon the\r\nplanks, and dripping slowly down through the cracks between them into\r\nthe sluggish stream, where it floated with the water in great red\r\nclouds, toward which creatures dwelling in slimy depths below came up\r\nlazily, but when they tasted it became furious and fought among\r\nthemselves like demons--blood drying in hideous networks and arabesques\r\nupon the railing of the bridge--blood upon the fences, blood upon the\r\ntrembling leaves of the bushes by the wayside--blood everywhere! And\r\neverywhere the upturned faces and torn bodies of men who had dared to do\r\ntheir duty and to die: side by side the white, who led and the black who\r\nfollowed--all set and motionless, but all wearing the same expression of\r\nbrave but hopeless determination. That was a brave charge at Balaklava,\r\nbut, trust me, there have been Balaklavas that are yet unsung.\r\n\r\nSo the expedition went back, and its brigades were redistributed to the\r\nSea Islands and to Florida; but why it was ever sent out, and why that\r\nregiment was sent forward to take the battery without artillery and\r\nwithout reinforcements, God, who knoweth all things, only knows. And God\r\nalone knows why there must be wars and rumors of wars, and why men made\r\nin his image must tear each other like maddened beasts.\r\n\r\nIn this battle, heavy as the losses were, the Confederates took but one\r\nprisoner. At the third charge a tall, broad-shouldered captain, who\r\nseemed, like another son of Thetis, almost invulnerable, darted\r\nimpetuously ahead of his men and reached the summit of the defence.\r\nUseless bravery! In an instant a volley point blank swept away the\r\ncharging men behind him, and a gunner's sabrethrust bore him to the\r\nground within the works, where he lay stunned and bleeding beside the\r\ngun he had striven so hard to take. The man who had captured him, wild\r\nwith excitement and maddened with the powder that blackened him and the\r\nhot blood which jetted upon him, sprang down, spat upon him, spurned him\r\nwith his foot, and would have dashed out his brains with the heavy hilt\r\nof his clubbed sword had not a strong hand grasped his uplifted wrist.\r\n\r\nIt was Fournier, who had watched the battle with an interest as intense\r\nas that of the most ardent Southerner in the battery, though widely\r\ndifferent in character. His interest was that of the naturalist who\r\nstands by eager and curious to see a rustic entrap some _rara avis_ that\r\nhe desires to study, to use for his experiment. Better for the bird: it\r\ncan suffer and die. Afterward what matter whether it stand neatly\r\nstuffed and mounted, a voiceless worshiper, in some glass mausoleum, or\r\nslowly moulder in a fence corner until its feathers are wafted far and\r\nwide, and only a little tuft of greener grass remains to its memory? As\r\nour naturalist's game was nobler and destined for more important study,\r\nso it was capable of lifelong suffering more subtle and intense. Perhaps\r\nFournier had not fully considered, in his eagerness to prove his\r\nhypothesis, the dangers to the subjects of his experiment. Perhaps his\r\nmind was so intent upon the physical aspect of the questions that he had\r\noverlooked some of the intellectual and moral elements involved in the\r\nproblem, and did not realize the enormities that would result should he\r\nsucceed. On the other hand, perhaps he saw them, realized them fully,\r\nand was the more deeply fascinated with the research because of its\r\nleading into such gloomy and mysterious regions of speculation. Let us\r\ndo him justice. Science was his god, and this idolater was willing to\r\nendure any labor and privation and to assume any responsibility in her\r\nservice. Would that more who worship a greater God were as devoted!\r\n\r\nHe was a physiologist, and was simply engaged in an experimental\r\ninvestigation, yet in its progress he had already uncivilized a man\r\nwhose eyes were beginning dimly to see the truth, had poisoned his mind\r\nwith lies, and had hurled him into depths of Plutonian ignorance\r\ninconceivably more profound than his original estate; and now he was\r\nabout to debase another fellow-creature of his own race, to tamper with\r\nhis manhood, to confuse his identity, to render him among his own\r\nkindred and people perhaps tabooed, ostracised, despised--perhaps an\r\nobject of pity. If he should succeed? Surely he had not come thus near\r\nsuccess to suffer his splendid Yankee captain to be brained there before\r\nhis eyes. Like a hawk he had watched every incident of the fight, and\r\nwas on the alert to act the part of surgeon toward any who might be\r\neither wounded in the battery or taken prisoner. He had even resolved,\r\nin case of the capture of the place, to represent his peculiar position\r\nto the United States officer in command, and to beg of him permission to\r\nmake his experiment upon a wounded rebel.\r\n\r\nThe gunner turned fiercely upon him, but dropped his arm and sheathed\r\nhis sabre at his question, and then walked back to his gun abashed, for\r\nhe was, after all, a brave and chivalrous man.\r\n\r\nFournier simply asked: \"Do Confederate soldiers _murder_ prisoners of\r\nwar?\" And added, \"He is a wounded man--leave him to me.\"\r\n\r\nThen he knelt down beside him and examined his wound, and though he\r\nstrove to be calm he trembled with excitement as he tore open the blue\r\nblouse and felt the warm blood welling over his fingers. It was a simple\r\nwound through the fleshy part of the shoulder: a strand of saddler's\r\nsilk and a few strips of sticking-plaster would have sufficed to dress\r\nit, but the Frenchman smiled when he wiped away the clots and saw the\r\nblood spurting from two or three small divided arteries.\r\n\r\nThen he called his African, and they carried the wounded man back to a\r\ntent, and laid him on a bed of moss and cypress boughs, and left him\r\nthere to bleed, while he went out into the air, and walked about, and\r\ntossed his hat and shouted with excitement like a madman. But the battle\r\nraged, and the gunners charged their guns and fired, and charged and\r\nfired again, and the men along the breastwork grew furious with the\r\nslaughter and the fiery draughts they took from their canteens through\r\nlips blackened with powder and defiled with grease and shreds of\r\ncartridge-paper; and no one noticed the doctor's mad conduct nor the\r\nsavage standing guard before the tent; nor did any other save those two\r\nin the whole battery--no, not even the gunner who had captured him--give\r\na thought to the prisoner who lay bleeding there, until the battle was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nAnd this prisoner, what of him? Any one, looking upon him as he lay upon\r\nthe cypress boughs, would have known him to be thoroughbred. Everything\r\nabout him proclaimed it. His face, manly but gentle, his figure, great\r\nin stature and strength, yet graceful in outline like a Grecian god, the\r\nvery dress and accoutrements he wore, which were neat, strong,\r\nexpensive, but without ornament, showed him to be a gentleman. And\r\nRobert Shirley was a gentleman. Probably no man in all the States could\r\nhave been found who would have presented a greater contrast to the man\r\nstanding guard outside the tent than this man who lay within it; and for\r\nthat reason none who would have been so welcome to Fournier. As the one\r\nwas a pure savage, the other was the realization of the most illustrious\r\nenlightenment; the one fierce, cunning, undisciplined, the other gentle,\r\nfrank, considerate; as the one was hideous, ill-formed and black as\r\nnight, so the other was radiant with manly beauty and fair as the\r\nmorning. Each among his own people sprang from noble stock; the one a\r\nprince, the other the descendant of the purest Puritan race, which knew\r\namong its own divines and judges brave captains, and farther back a\r\ngovernor of the colony. But the guard and his people were at the foot of\r\nthe scale, the guarded at the top. The blood flowing out upon the\r\ncypress bed was the best blood of America. It was blue blood and brave\r\nblood. Generation after generation it had flowed in the veins of fair\r\nwomen and noble men, and had never known dishonor. Yet Fournier let it\r\nflow. More, he was delighted that it continued to flow.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, he sobered down, and began to prepare for his work.\r\nHe placed a large caldron of water over a fire; he brought basins,\r\ntowels and his case of surgical instruments, and placed them in the,\r\ntent, and with them the case which he had taught the African to believe\r\ncontained his god. While thus busied he did not neglect the subject of\r\nhis experiment. His watchful eye noted everything--the mass, of clots\r\ngrowing like a great crimson fungus under the wounded shoulder, the\r\ndeadly pallor, the dark circles forming around the sunken eyes, the\r\nblanched lips, the transparent nostrils, the slow, deep respiration.\r\nFrom time to time he felt the wounded man's pulse and counted it\r\ncarefully. _Ninety_--he went out again into the open air; _one\r\nhundred_--\"The loss of blood tells,\" he muttered, and began to rearrange\r\nhis appliances and busy himself uneasily with them; _one hundred and\r\nthirty beats to the minute _--\"He is failing too fast: I must stop this\r\nbleeding\" said the experimenter. Then he cleansed the wound, and tied\r\nthe arteries, and bound it up. But the loss of blood had been so great\r\nthat the heart fluttered wildly and feebly in its efforts to contract\r\nupon its diminished contents, and Fournier, anxious, and pale himself\r\nalmost as his victim, trembled when his finger felt in vain for the\r\nbleeding artery and caught only a faint tremulous thrill, so feeble that\r\nhe scarcely knew whether the heart was beating at all or not. In terror\r\nhe threw the ends of the little tent and fanned him, and moistened his\r\nlips, and gave him brandy, and hastened to begin the experiment for\r\nwhich he had waited so long and for which both subjects were at last\r\nready.\r\n\r\nHe told his savage that the Yankee was dying, but that he had communed\r\nwith his god, who would let him live if blood was given in return. Then\r\nhe reminded him of the time when he lost blood, and that it had done him\r\nno harm. The African, trained for this duty with so much care, did not\r\nfail him, but bared his arm and gave the blood. The god was brought\r\nforth and caught it, and the sacrifice began. As the silver, bowl\r\nfloated in a basin of water so warm that the thermometer in its side\r\nmarked ninety-eight degrees of Fahrenheit, Fournier stirred the blood\r\nflowing into it quickly with the bundle of wires, to collect the fibrine\r\nand prevent the formation of clots; he then drew it into the syringe\r\nthrough the strainer, and forced it through the perforated needle, which\r\nhe had previously thrust into a large vein in Shirley's arm, carefully\r\navoiding the introduction of the slightest bubble of air. Time after\r\ntime he filled his syringe and emptied it into the veins of the wounded\r\nman, until at length he saw signs of reaction. The color came, the\r\nbreathing became more natural, the pulse became slower, fuller, regular.\r\nBy and by he moved, sighed, opened his eyes and spoke.\r\n\r\nHe asked a question: \"What has happened?\"\r\n\r\nWhile he had been lying there much had happened. Life and death had\r\nbattled over him, and life had triumphed. When he recovered from the\r\neffects of his fall and found himself bleeding, he tried to rise and\r\nstanch the flow, but, already exhausted, he fell back almost fainting\r\nfrom the effort. He called repeatedly for help, but his only reply was\r\nthe hideous face of his guard, silently leering at him for a moment,\r\nthen disappearing without a word, At last it occurred to him that he had\r\nbeen left there to die, and he roused all his energies to his aid. How\r\nwe strive for our lives! But Shirley accomplished nothing, he could not\r\neven raise his hand to the bleeding shoulder, with every effort the\r\nblood flowed more copiously. His mind was rapidly becoming benumbed like\r\nhis body, which shivered as though it were mid winter. Darkness came\r\nover his eyes, and as he listened to the din of the battle he fell into\r\na dreamy state that soon passed into seeming unconsciousness again.\r\nNevertheless, while the doctor came and went and did his work, and the\r\nsavage scowled at him, yet gave his life's blood to save him, though he\r\nlay like a dead man and saw them not, nor heard them, nor even felt the\r\nneedle in his flesh, his mind was not idle. Strange doubts and fears,\r\nwild longings and regrets, sweet thoughts of long-forgotten happiness,\r\nand fair visions of the future, busied his brain. Memory unrolled her\r\nscroll and breathed upon the letters of his story that lapse of time and\r\npress of circumstance had made dim, till they grew clear, and with\r\nhimself he lived his life again, and nothing was lost out of it or\r\nforgotten. There was his mother's face again, with the old, old loving\r\nsmile upon her lips and the tender mother-love in the depths of her\r\nbeautiful blue eyes--lips that had so oven kissed away his childish\r\ntears, and had taught him to say at evening, \"Our Father\" and \"Now I lay\r\nme down to sleep,\" eyes that had never looked upon him without something\r\nof the heavenly light of which they were now so full. There before him,\r\nbright and clear as ever, were the scenes of his boyhood--the\r\nschool-forms defaced with many a rude cutting of names and dates, the\r\nmaster knitting his shaggy brows and tapping meaningly with his ruler\r\nupon the awful desk while some white haired urchin floundered through an\r\nill-learned task and his classmates tittered at his blunders. Dear old\r\nclassmates! How their faces shone and gladdened as they chased the\r\nbounding football! How merrily they flushed and glowed when the clear\r\nfrosty air of the Northern winter quivered with the ring of their skates\r\nupon the hard ice! How soberly side by side they solved problems and\r\nlooked up _sesquipedalia verba_ in big lexicons! And how happily the\r\nlate evening hours wore away as they read _Ivanhoe_ and the _Leather\r\nStocking Tales_ by the fireside with shellbarks and pippins!\r\n\r\nThen the college days flew by with all their romance and delight. Again\r\nthere were bells ringing to morning prayers, recitations and lectures,\r\nexaminations and prizes, speeches and medals, and the glorious\r\nfriendships, pure, earnest, almost holy. Would there were more such\r\nfriendships in the outer, wider world! Commencement with its \"pomp and\r\ncircumstance,\" its tedious ceremony and scholarly display, its friends\r\nfrom home--mothers, sisters, sweethearts, all bright eyes and fond\r\nhearts, its music and flowers, its caps, gowns, dress-coats and\r\n\"spreads,\" and, last and worst of all, its sorrowful \"good-byes,\" some\r\nof them, alas! for ever! Once more he trembled as he rose to make his\r\ncommencement speech, but slowly, as he went on, his voice grew steady\r\nand his manner calmer, for, lad as he was, and tyro at \"orations,\" he\r\nwas in earnest. \"May my light hand forget its cunning, O my brother! may\r\nmy tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, O ye oppressed! if ever there\r\ncomes to me an opportunity to help you win your way to freedom and I\r\nfail you!\" He, the aristocrat of his class, had chosen to speak \"Against\r\nCaste,\" and though he spoke with the enthusiasm of an untried man, it\r\nwas with devoted honesty of purpose, of which his earnestness was\r\nwitness, and of which his future was to give ample proof. Again in\r\nvision he stood before that assembly and spoke for the lowly and\r\noppressed. \"Let every man have place and honor as he proves himself\r\nworthy. Make the way clear for all.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the bewilderment of applause that greeted him as he finished he\r\nsaw only the glad, smiling face of Alice Wentworth nodding approval of\r\nthe rest, hundreds though they were, he saw nothing. Her congratulation\r\nwas enough.\r\n\r\nThen came tenderer scenes, and Alice Wentworth was to be his wife.\r\nAnother change, and he is in the midst of ruder scenes. There is war,\r\ncivil war, and he is a soldier, once more he seems to be in Virginia,\r\nand there are marches and counter-marches, camps and barracks, battles\r\nand retreats, and all the great and little miseries of long campaigns.\r\nThe silver leaflets of a major are exchanged for the golden eagles of a\r\ncolonel, and all the time, amid sterner duties, he finds time to write\r\nto Alice Wentworth, and never a mail comes into camp but he is sure of\r\nletters dated 'Home' and full of words that make him hopeful and brave,\r\n\"'Home!' Yes hers and mine too, if home's where the heart is!'\" he\r\nthinks, and he loves her more dearly every day.\r\n\r\nNegro troops are raised, and, true to his principles and to himself, he\r\nresigns his commission to take a lower rank in a colored regiment. Now\r\nthe scenes grow dim, confused sounds far off disturb him, low music,\r\nfamiliar yet strange, now distant, now at his very ear, attracts him, a\r\nweird, shadowy mist encloses him, concealing even the things which were\r\nvisible to the mind's eye, and memory and thought have almost ceased.\r\nYet while all else fades away, clear and beautiful before him are two\r\nfaces that cannot be forgotten--his mother's face, and that other, which\r\nhe loves, if that can be, even more. Thus, with the 'Our Father' not on\r\nhis lips, but fixed in his mind, he feels himself drifting\r\naway--drifting away like a boat that has broken its moorings and drifts\r\nout with the ebbing tide--whither?\r\n\r\nBut the rich, warm, lusty blood of the African quickly does its work.\r\nThe heart, which had almost ceased to beat, because there was not blood\r\nenough for it to contract upon, reacted to the stimulus, and as it\r\nrevived and sent the new life pulsating through all the body the whole\r\nman revived, and again:\r\n\r\nThe fever called _living_ burned in his brain.\r\n\r\nFournier, under one pretext or another, but really by the force of his\r\nrelentless will, kept his victim by him for years after their escape\r\nfrom the South. He noted from time to time certain curious changes that\r\ntook place in his physical nature, and recorded his observations with\r\nscientific precision in a book kept for the purpose, for the renewal of\r\nlife had entailed results of an extraordinary character, as the reader\r\nmay have already anticipated. At length he wrote 'My hypothesis is\r\nverified, it has become a theory. My theory is proved, it is a\r\nphysiological law. _Climatic influences, acting upon man, bring about\r\nphysical changes exceedingly slowly, because they are resisted by an\r\ninveterate habit of assimilation which pertains to the blood._'\r\n\r\nThat day Shirley was free. His rescuer had finished his experiment.\r\n\r\nAlice Wentworth had never believed that her lover was dead. She had\r\nheard all with a troubled heart, but while his distant kinsmen, who were\r\nheirs-at-law, put on the deepest mourning and grew impatient of the\r\nlaw's delay, she simply said, \"I will wait until there is some proof\r\nbefore I give him up! Proof! proof! Shall I be quicker than the law to\r\ngive up every hope?\" And in her heart she said, \"He is not dead.\" Even\r\nwhen years had passed and the war was over, and her agent had searched\r\neverywhere and found no trace of him, she did not cease to hope that he\r\nwould yet appear. So, when at length a letter came, it was welcome and\r\nexpected. Not surprise but joy made her start and tremble as the old\r\nfamiliar superscription met her eyes.\r\n\r\nSuch a letter!--filled with the spirit of his love, breathing in every\r\nword the tender, passionate devotion of an earlier day, and yet so sad.\r\nTears dropped down through her smiles of joy and blurred the lines she\r\nread at first, but smiles and tears alike ceased as she read on. He had\r\nwritten many, many times, but he knew she had not got his letters. He\r\nhad been a prisoner--not only prisoner of war, but afterward prisoner to\r\na man whose will was iron. It could hardly be explained. This man had\r\nnot only saved his life, but he had also rescued him from the horrors of\r\na Southern prison--would God he had let him die!--and they had been\r\nliving together in a ranch in a far off Mexican valley.\r\n\r\nThen the letter went on:\r\n\r\n\"In my heart I am unchanged; my love for you is ever the same; yet I am\r\nno longer the Robert Shirley whom you knew. That has come upon me which\r\nwill separate me from you for ever: I cannot ask you now to be my wife.\r\nYou are free. It is through no fault of mine. It is my burden, the price\r\nof life, and I must bear it. God bless you and give you all happiness!\r\n\r\n\"ROBERT SHIRLEY:\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had read it all she bowed her head and wept again, and the face\r\nthat had grown more and more beautiful with the years of waiting was\r\nradiant. Who can fathom the depths of a woman's love? Who can follow the\r\nsubtle workings of a woman's thought? Who can comprehend a woman's\r\nboundless faith? Her course was clear. If misfortune had befallen him,\r\nif he were maimed, disfigured, crazed, even if he were loathsome to her\r\neyes, she loved him, and she must see him: she would see him and speak\r\nto him, and love him still, even if she could not be his wife. What\r\nwould she have done if she could have guessed the truth? As it was, she\r\nwrote upon her card, \"If you love me, come to me,\" and sent it to him.\r\nAnd in answer to the summons he stood before her--not disfigured, not\r\nmaimed, not crazed, not loathsome in any way, yet irrevocably separated\r\nfrom her for Dr. Fournier's experiment had succeeded, and Robert Shirley\r\nwas a mulatto!\r\n\r\nCORNELIUS DEWEES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO THE KING OF AURORA.\r\n\r\n(FROM THE GERMAN OF THEODORE KIRSCHOFF.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Oregon and California Railroad, twenty-eight miles south of the\r\ncity of Portland in Oregon, lies the German colony of Aurora, a\r\ncommunist settlement under the direction of Doctor William Keil. In\r\nSeptember, 1871, I made a second journey from San Francisco to Oregon,\r\non which occasion I found both time and opportunity to carry out a\r\nlong-cherished desire to visit this colony, already famous throughout\r\nall Oregon, and to make the acquaintance of the still more famous\r\ndoctor, the so-called \"king of Aurora.\" During the years in which I had\r\nformerly resided in Oregon, and especially on this last journey thither,\r\nI had frequently heard this settlement and its autocrat spoken of, and\r\nhad been told the strangest stories as to the government of its\r\nself-made potentate. All reports agreed in stating that \"Dutchtown,\" the\r\ngeneric appellation of German colonies among Americans, was an example\r\nto all settlements, and was distinguished above any other place in\r\nOregon for order and prosperity. The hotel of \"Dutchtown,\" which stands\r\non the old Overland stage-route, and is now a station on the Oregon and\r\nCalifornia Railroad, has attained an enviable reputation, and is\r\nregarded by all travelers as the best in the State; and as to the colony\r\nitself, I heard nothing but praise. On the other hand, with regard to\r\nDoctor Keil the strangest reports were in circulation. He had been\r\ndescribed to me in Portland as a most inaccessible person, showing\r\nhimself extremely reserved toward strangers, and declining to give them\r\nthe slightest satisfaction as to the interior management of the\r\nprosperous community over which he reigned a sovereign prince. The\r\ninitiated maintained that this important personage had formerly been a\r\ntailor in Germany. He was at once the spiritual and secular head of the\r\ncommunity: he solemnized marriages (much against his will, for,\r\naccording to the rules of the society, he was obliged to provide a\r\nhouse for every newly-married couple); he was physician and preacher,\r\njudge, law-giver, secretary of state, administrator, and unlimited and\r\nirresponsible minister of finance to the colony; and held all the very\r\nvaluable landed property of the settlement, with the consent of the\r\ncolonists, in his own name; and while he certainly provided for his\r\nvoluntarily obedient subjects an excellent maintenance for life, he\r\nreserved to himself the entire profits of the labor of all and the value\r\nof the joint property, notwithstanding that the colony was established\r\non the broadest principles as a communist association.\r\n\r\nI had a great desire to see this original man--a kindred spirit of the\r\nrenowned Mormon leader, Brigham Young--with my own eyes, and, so to\r\nspeak, to visit the lion in his den. From Portland, where I was staying,\r\nthe colony was easily accessible by rail, and before leaving I made the\r\nacquaintance of a. German life-insurance agent of a Chicago\r\ncompany--Körner by name--who, like myself, wished to visit Aurora, and\r\nin whom I found a very agreeable traveling companion. He had procured in\r\nPortland letters of introduction to Doctor Keil, and had conceived the\r\nbold plan of doing a stroke of business in life insurance with him;\r\nindeed, his main object in going to Aurora was to induce the doctor to\r\ninsure the lives of the entire colony--that is to say, of all his\r\nvoluntary subjects--in the Chicago company, pay, as irresponsible\r\ntreasurer of the association, the legal premiums, and upon the\r\noccurrence of a death pocket the amount of the policy.\r\n\r\nMy fellow-traveler had great hopes of making the doctor see this project\r\nin the light of an advantageous speculation, and accordingly provided\r\nhimself amply with the necessary tables of mortality and other\r\nstatistics. It had been carefully impressed upon us in Portland always\r\nto address the _ci-devant_ tailor, now \"king of Aurora,\" as \"Doctor,\" of\r\nwhich title he was extremely vain, and to treat him with all the\r\nreverence which as sovereign republicans we could muster; otherwise he\r\nwould probably turn his back on us without ceremony.\r\n\r\nOn a pleasant September morning the steam ferry-boat conveyed us from\r\nPortland across the Willamette River to the dépôt of the Oregon and\r\nCalifornia Railroad, and soon afterward we were rushing southward in the\r\ntrain along the right shore of that stream--here as broad as the\r\nRhine--the rival of the mighty Columbia. After a pleasant and\r\ninteresting journey through giant forests and over fertile prairies,\r\nsome large, some small, embellished here and there with farms, villages\r\nand orchards, we reached Oregon City, which lies in a romantic region\r\nclose to the Willamette: then leaving the river, we thundered on some\r\nmiles farther through the majestic primitive forest, and soon entered\r\nupon a broad, wood-skirted prairie, over which here and there pretty\r\nfarm-houses and groves are scattered; and presently beheld, peeping out\r\nfrom swelling hills and standing in the middle of a prosperous\r\nsettlement embowered in verdure, the slender white church-tower of\r\nAurora, and were at the end of our journey.\r\n\r\nOur first course after we left the cars was to the tavern, standing\r\nclose to the railroad on a little hill, whither the passengers hurried\r\nfor lunch. This so-called \"hotel,\" the best known and most famous, as\r\nhas already been said, in all Oregon, I might compare to an\r\nold-fashioned inn. The long table with its spotless table-cloth was\r\nlavishly spread with genuine German dishes, excellently cooked, and we\r\nwere waited on by comely and neatly-dressed German girls; and though the\r\ndinner would not perhaps compare with the same meal at the club-house of\r\nthe \"San Francisco\" I must confess that it was incomparably the best I\r\never tasted in Oregon, in which region neither the cooks nor the bills\r\nof fare are usually of the highest order.\r\n\r\nDinner being over, we made inquiry for Doctor Keil, to whom we were now\r\nready to pay our respects. Our host pointed out to us the doctor's\r\ndwelling-house, which looked, in the distance, like the premises of a\r\nwell-to-do Low-Dutch farmer; and after passing over a long stretch of\r\nplank-road, we turned in the direction of the royal residence. On the\r\nway we met several laborers just coming from the field, who looked as if\r\nlife went well with them--girls in short frocks with rake in hand, and\r\nboys comfortably smoking their clay pipes--and received from all an\r\nhonest German greeting. Everything here had a German aspect--the houses\r\npleasantly shaded by foliage, the barns, stables and well-cultivated\r\nfields, the flower and kitchen-gardens, the white church-steeple rising\r\nfrom a green hill: nothing but the fences which enclose the fields\r\nreminded us that we were in America.\r\n\r\nThe doctor's residence was surrounded by a high white picket-fence:\r\nstately, widespreading live-oaks shaded it, and the spacious courtyard\r\nhad a neat and carefully-kept aspect. Crowing cocks, and hens each with\r\nher brood, were scratching and picking about, the geese cackled, and\r\nseveral well-trained dogs gave us a noisy welcome. Upon our asking for\r\nthe doctor, a friendly German matron directed us to the orchard, whither\r\nwe immediately turned our steps. A really magnificent sight met our\r\neyes--thousands of trees, whose branches, covered with the finest fruit,\r\nwere so loaded that it had been necessary to place props under many of\r\nthem, lest they should break beneath the weight of their luscious\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nHere we soon discovered the renowned doctor, in a toilette the very\r\nopposite of regal, zealously engaged in gathering his apples. He was\r\nstanding on a high ladder, in his shirt sleeves, a cotton apron, a straw\r\nhat, picking the rosy-cheeked fruit in a hand-basket. Several laborers\r\nwere busy under the trees assorting the gathered apples, and carefully\r\npacking in boxes the choicest of them--really splendid specimens of this\r\nfruit, which attains its utmost perfection in Oregon. As soon as the\r\ndoctor perceived us he came down from the ladder, and asked somewhat\r\nsharply what our business there might be. My companion handed him the\r\nletters of introduction he had brought with him, which the doctor read\r\nattentively through: he then introduced my humble self as a literary man\r\nand assistant editor of a well-known magazine, who had come to Oregon\r\nfor the special purpose of visiting Dr. Keil, and of inspecting his\r\ncolony, of which such favorable reports had reached us. Without waiting\r\nfor the doctor's reply, I asked him whether he were not a relative of\r\nK----, the principal editor of the magazine to which I was attached. I\r\ncould scarcely, as it appeared, have hit upon a more opportune question,\r\nfor the doctor was evidently flattered, and became at once extremely\r\naffable toward us. The relationship to which I had alluded he was\r\nobliged unwillingly to disclaim. I learned from him that his name was\r\nWilliam Keil, and that he was born at Bleicherode in Prussian Saxony. He\r\nnow left the apple-gathering to his men, and offered to show us whatever\r\nwas interesting about the colony: as to the life-insurance project, he\r\nsaid he would take some more convenient opportunity to speak with Mr.\r\nKörner about it.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who after this showed himself somewhat loquacious, was a man\r\nof agreeable appearance, perhaps of about sixty years of age, with white\r\nhair, a broad high forehead and an intelligent countenance. Sound as a\r\nnut, powerfully built, of vigorous constitution and with an air of\r\nauthority, he gave the idea of a man born to rule. He seemed to wish to\r\nmake a good impression on us, and I remarked several times in him a\r\nsearching side-glance, as though he were trying to read our thoughts. He\r\nsustained the entire conversation himself, and it was somewhat difficult\r\nto follow his meaning: he spoke in an unctuous, oratorical tone, with\r\nextreme suavity, in very general terms, and evaded all direct questions.\r\nWhen I had listened to him for ten minutes I was not one whit wiser than\r\nbefore. His language was not remarkably choice, and he used liberally a\r\nmixture of words half English, half German, as uneducated\r\nGerman-Americans are apt to do.\r\n\r\nWhile we wandered through the orchard, the beauty and practical utility\r\nof which astonished me, the doctor, gave us a lecture on colonization,\r\nagriculture, gardening, horticulture, etc., which he flavored here and\r\nthere with pious reflections. He pointed out with pride that all this\r\nwas his own work, and described how he had transformed the wilderness\r\ninto a garden. In the year 1856 he came with forty followers to Oregon,\r\nas a delegate from the parent association of Bethel in Missouri, in\r\norder to found in the far West, then so little known, a branch colony.\r\nAt present the doctor is president both of Aurora and of the original\r\nsettlement at Bethel: the latter consists of about four hundred members,\r\nthe former of four hundred and ten.\r\n\r\nWhen he first came into this region he found the whole district now\r\nowned by his flourishing colony covered with marsh and forest. Instead,\r\nhowever, of establishing himself on the prairies lying farther south, in\r\nthe midst of foreign settlers, he preferred a home shared only with his\r\nGerman brethren in the primitive woods; and here, having at that time\r\nvery small means, he obtained from the government, gratis, land enough\r\nto provide homes for his colonists, and found in the timber a source of\r\ncapital, which he at once made productive. He next proceeded to build a\r\nblock-house as a defence against the Indians, who at that time were\r\nhostile in Oregon: then he erected a saw-mill and cleared off the\r\ntimber, part of which he used to build houses for his colonists, and\r\nwith part opened an advantageous trade with his American neighbors, who,\r\nliving on the prairie, were soon entirely dependent on him for all their\r\ntimber. The land, once cleared, was soon cultivated and planted, with\r\norchards: the finer varieties of fruit he shipped for sale to Portland\r\nand San Francisco, and from the sour apples he either made vinegar or\r\nsold them to the older settlers, who very soon made themselves sick on\r\nthem. He then attended them in the character of physician, and cured\r\nthem of their ailments at a good round charge. This joke the good doctor\r\nrelated with especial satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, the doctor continued to say, the number of colonists\r\nincreased; and his means and strength being thus enlarged, he\r\nestablished a tannery, a factory, looms, flouring-mills, built more\r\nhouses for his colonists, cleared more land and drained the marshes,\r\nincreased his orchards, laid out new farms, gave some attention to\r\nadornment, erected a church and school-houses, and purchased from the\r\nAmerican settlers in the neighborhood their best lands for a song. He\r\ndid everything systematically. He always assigned his colonists the sort\r\nof labor that they appeared to him best fitted for, and each one found\r\nthe place best suited to his capabilities. If any one objected to doing\r\nhis will and obeying his orders, he was driven out of the colony, for he\r\nwould endure no opposition. He made the best leather, the best hams and\r\ngathered the best crops in all Oregon. The possessions of the colony,\r\nwhich he added to as he was able, extended already over twenty sections\r\n(a section contains six hundred and forty acres, or an English square\r\nmile), and the most perfect order and industry existed everywhere.\r\n\r\nThus the doctor; and amid this and the like conversation we walked over\r\nan orchard covering forty acres. The eight thousand trees it contained\r\nyielded annually five thousand bushels of choice apples and eight\r\nthousand of the finest pears, and the crop increased yearly. The doctor\r\npointed out repeatedly the excellence of his culture in contrast with\r\nthe American mode, which leaves the weeds to grow undisturbed among the\r\ntrees, and disregards entirely all regularity and beauty. He, on the\r\ncontrary, insisted no less on embellishment than on neatness and order;\r\nand this was no vain boast. Carefully-kept walks led through the\r\ngrounds; verdant turf, flowerbeds and charming shady arbors met us at\r\nevery turn; there were long beds planted with flourishing currant,\r\nraspberry and blackberry bushes, and large tracts set with rows of\r\nbearing vines, on which luscious grapes hung invitingly. Order also\r\nreigned among the fruit trees: here were several acres of nothing but\r\napples, again a plantation of pears or apricots, beneath which not a\r\nweed was to be seen: the hoe and the rake had done their work\r\nthoroughly. Everything was in the most perfect order: the courtgardener\r\nof a German prince might have been proud of it.\r\n\r\nWe seated ourselves in a shady arbor, where the doctor entertained us\r\nfurther with an account of his religious belief. He had, he said, no\r\nfixed creed and no established religion: there were in the colony\r\nProtestants, Catholics, Methodists, Baptists, indeed Christians of every\r\nname, and even Jews. Every one was at liberty to hold what faith he\r\npleased: he preached only natural religion, and whoever shaped his life\r\naccording to that would be happy. After this he enlarged on the\r\nprosperity of the colony, which was founded on the principles of natural\r\nreligion, and prosed about humility, love to our neighbor, kindness and\r\ncarrying religion into everything; and then back he came to Nature and\r\nhimself, until my head was perfectly bewildered. I had given up long\r\nbefore this, in despair, any questions as to the interior organization\r\nof the colony, for the doctor either gave me evasive answers or none at\r\nall. His colonists, he asserted, loved him as a father, and he cared for\r\nthem accordingly: both these assertions were undoubtedly true. The deep\r\nrespect with which those whom we occasionally met lifted their hats to\r\n\"the doctor\"--a form of greeting by no means universal in America--bore\r\nwitness to their unbounded esteem for him. Toward us also they demeaned\r\nthemselves with great respect, as to noble strangers whom the doctor\r\ndeigned to honor with his society. As to his care for them, no one who\r\nwitnessed it could deny the exceedingly flourishing condition of the\r\nsettlement. Whether, however, in all this the doctor had not a keen eye\r\nto his own interest was an afterthought which involuntarily presented\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAs we left the orchard, the doctor pointed out to us several\r\nwheat-fields in the neighborhood, cultivated with true German love for\r\nneatness, which formed, with the pleasant dwellings adjoining, separate\r\nfarms. The average yield per acre, he observed, was from twenty-five to\r\nforty bushels of wheat, and from forty to fifty of oats. He then took us\r\ninto a neighboring grove, to a place where the pic-nics and holiday\r\nfeasts of the colony are held: here we paused near a grassy knoll shaded\r\nby a sort of awning and surrounded by a moat. This, which bears the name\r\nof \"The Temple Hill,\" forms the centre of a number of straight roads,\r\nwhich branch out from it into the woods in the shape of a fan. Not far\r\nfrom it I noticed a dancing ground covered by a circular open roof, and\r\na pavilion for the music.\r\n\r\n\"At our public feasts,\" said the doctor, \"I have all these branching\r\nroads lighted with colored lanterns, and illuminate the temple, which,\r\nwith its brilliant lamps, makes quite an imposing spectacle. When we\r\ncelebrate our May-day festival it looks, after dark, like a scene out of\r\nthe _Arabian Nights_; and when, added to this, we have beautiful music\r\nand fine singing, and the young folks are enjoying the dance, it is\r\nreally very pleasant. But none are permitted to set foot on the Temple\r\nHill, nor can they do it very easily if they would. Do you know the\r\nreason, gentlemen?\" Körner opined that it might be on account of the\r\nditch, which would be difficult to pass, in which view I agreed.\r\n\"Exactly so,\" remarked the doctor. \"This Temple Hill has an especial\r\nsignificance: it represents the sovereign ruler of the people, on whose\r\nhead no one may tread: on that account the ditch is there.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a walk of several hours we returned to the doctor's house, where\r\nhe invited us to take a glass of homemade wine. As we had been informed\r\nthat the sale and use of wine and spirits were strictly forbidden in the\r\ncolony, this invitation was certainly an unprecedented exception. The\r\nwine, of which two kinds were placed before us--one made of wild grapes,\r\nand the other of currants--was very good, and was partaken of in the\r\ndoctor's office. Here Mr. Körner again brought forward his\r\nlife-insurance project: the doctor gave him hopes that he would go into\r\nit, but he wished to give the matter due consideration, and to subject\r\nthe advantages and disadvantages of the speculation to a strict\r\ninvestigation, before giving a definite answer; and with this ended our\r\nvisit to the \"king of Aurora.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the colony we obtained considerable information from the\r\nmembers as to their interior organization and government, the results of\r\nwhich, as well as what I further learned respecting Doctor Keil, I will\r\nstate briefly.\r\n\r\nShould any one wish to become a member of the colony, he must, in the\r\nfirst place, put all his ready money into the hands of Doctor Keil: he\r\nwill then be taken on trial. If the candidate satisfies the doctor, he\r\ncan remain and become one of the community: should this, however, not be\r\nthe case, he receives again the capital he paid in, but without\r\ninterest. How long he must remain \"on probation\" in the colony, and work\r\nthere, depends entirely on the doctor's pleasure. If a member leaves the\r\ncommunity voluntarily--a thing almost unheard of--he receives back his\r\ncapital without interest, together with a _pro rata_ share of the\r\nearnings of the community during his membership, as appraised by the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nAll the ordinary necessaries of life are supplied gratuitously to the\r\nmembers of the community. The doctor holds the common purse, out of\r\nwhich all purchases are paid for, and into which go the profits from the\r\nagricultural and industrial products of the colony. If any member needs\r\na coat or other article of clothing, flour, sugar or tobacco, he can get\r\nwhatever he wants, without paying for it, at the \"store:\" in the same\r\nway he procures meat from the butcher and bread from the baker: spirits\r\nare forbidden except in case of sickness. The doctor also appoints the\r\noccupation of each member, so as to contribute to the best welfare of\r\nthe colony--whether he shall be a farmer, a mechanic, a common laborer,\r\nor whatever he can be most usefully employed in; and the time and\r\ntalents of each are regarded as belonging to the whole community,\r\nsubject only to the doctor's judgment. If a member marries, a separate\r\ndwelling-house and a certain amount of land are assigned him, so that\r\nthe families of the settlement are scattered about on farms. The elders\r\nof the colony support the doctor in the duties of his office by counsel\r\nand assistance.\r\n\r\nThe lands of the colony are collectively recorded in Doctor Keil's name,\r\nin order, as he says, to avoid intricate and complicated law-papers. It\r\nwould, however, be for the interest of the colonists to make, a speedy\r\nchange in this respect, so that the members of the community, in case of\r\nthe doctor's death, might obtain each his share of the lands without\r\nlitigation. Should the doctor's decease occur soon, before this\r\nalteration is made, his natural heirs could claim the whole property of\r\nthe colony, and the members would be left in the lurch. He does not\r\nappear, however, to be in great haste to effect this change, though it\r\nought to have been done long ago. It is always said among the colonists,\r\nnaturally enough, that all the ground is the common property of the\r\ncommunity. Whether the doctor fully subscribes to this opinion in his\r\nsecret heart might be a question.\r\n\r\nDoctor Keil is at the same time the religious head and the unlimited\r\nsecular ruler of the colony of Aurora, and can ordain, with the consent\r\nof the elders (who very naturally uphold his authority), what he\r\npleases. A life free from care and responsibility, such as the members\r\nof the community (who, for the most part, belong to the lower and\r\nuncultivated class) lead--a life in regard to which no one but the\r\ndoctor has the trouble of thinking--is the main ground of the\r\nundisturbed continuance of the colony. The pre-eminent talent for\r\norganization, combined with the unlimited powers of command, which the\r\ndoctor--justly named \"king of Aurora\"--possesses, together with the\r\ninborn industry peculiar to Germans, is the cause of the prosperity of\r\nthe settlement, which calls itself communistic, but is certainly nothing\r\nmore than a vast farm belonging to its talented founder. It has its\r\nschools, its churches, newspapers and books--the selection and tendency\r\nof which the doctor sees to--and no lack of social pleasures, music and\r\nsinging. Taken together with an easily-procured livelihood, all this\r\nsatisfies the desires of the colonists entirely, and the good doctor\r\ntakes care of everything else.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH SILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAY EYES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always counted it among the larger blessings of Providence that\r\na woman can bear up year after year under a weight of dullness which\r\nwould drive a man of the same mental calibre to desperation in a month.\r\n\r\nI had no idea what a heavy burden mine had been until one day my brother\r\nasked me to go to sea with him on his next voyage. He and his wife were\r\nat the farm on their wedding-tour, and only the happiness of a\r\nbridegroom could have led him to hold out to me this way of escape.\r\nChristian's heart when he dropped his pack was not lighter than mine.\r\nButter and cheese are good things in their way--the world would miss\r\nthem if all the farmers' daughters went suddenly down to the sea in\r\nships--but it is possible to have too much of a good thing, and such had\r\nbeen my feeling for some years.\r\n\r\nSo suddenly and completely did my threadbare endurance give way that if\r\nFrank had revoked his words the next minute, I must have gone away at\r\nonce to some crowded place and drawn a few deep breaths of excitement\r\nbefore I could have joined again the broken ends of my patience.\r\n\r\nNo bride-elect poor in this world's goods ever went about the\r\npreparations for her wedding with more delicious awe than I felt in\r\nturning one old gown upside down, and another inside out, for seafaring\r\nuse. There was excitement enough in the departure, the inevitable\r\nsea-changes, and finally the memory of it all, to keep my mind busy for\r\na few weeks, but when we settled into the grooves of a tropical voyage,\r\nwafted along as easily by the trade winds as if some gigantic hand,\r\nunseen and steady, had us in its grasp, my life was wholly changed, and\r\nyet it bore an odd family resemblance to the days at the farm. It was a\r\npleasant dullness, because, in the nature of things, it must soon have\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nI went on deck to look at a passing ship about as often as I used to run\r\nto the window at the sound of carriagewheels. One can't take a very\r\nintimate interest in whales and the other seamonsters unless one is\r\nscientific. Time died with me a slow but by no means a painful death. I\r\nused to fold my hands and look at them by the hour, internally\r\nrollicking over the idea that there was no milk to skim or dishes to\r\nwash, or any earthly wheel in motion that required my shoulder to turn\r\nit. I spent much time in a half-awake state in the long warm days, out\r\nof sheer delight in wasting time after saving it all my life.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that I slept lightly o' nights. Every morning the\r\nsteward came into the cabin with the first dawn of day to scour his\r\nfloors before the captain should appear. He had a habit of talking to\r\nhimself over this early labor, and one morning, more awake than usual, I\r\nfound that he was praying. \"O Lord, be good to me! I wasn't to blame. I\r\nwould have helped her if I could. O Lord, be good to me!\" and other\r\nhomely entreaties were repeated again and again.\r\n\r\nHe was a meek, bowed old negro, with snowy hair, and so many wrinkles\r\nthat all expression was shrunk out of his face. He was an excellent\r\ncook, but he waited on table with a manner so utterly despairing that\r\nit took away one's appetite to look at him.\r\n\r\nFor many mornings after this I listened to his prayers, which grew more\r\nand more earnest and importunate. I could not think he had done any harm\r\nwith his own will. He must have been more sinned against than sinning.\r\n\r\nHe brought me a shawl one cool evening as if it were my death-warrant,\r\nand I said, in the sepulchral tone that wins confidence, \"Pedro, do you\r\nalways say your prayers when you are alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, miss, 'board _this_ ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with, this ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose you don't have no faith in ghosts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much.\"\r\n\r\n\"White folks mostly don't,\" said Pedro with aggravating meekness, and\r\nturned into his pantry.\r\n\r\nI followed him to the door, and stood in it so that he had no escape:\r\n\"What has that to do with your prayers?\"\r\n\r\n\"This cabin has got a ghost in it.\"\r\n\r\nI looked over my shoulder into the dusk, and shivered a little, which\r\nwas not lost on Pedro. He grew more solemn if possible than before: \"I\r\nsee her 'most every morning, and if my back is to the door, I see her\r\nall the same. She don't never touch me, but I keep at the prayers for\r\nfear she will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you never see her except in the morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once or twice she has just put her head out of the door of the middle\r\nstate-room when I was waitin' on table.\"\r\n\r\n\"In broad daylight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sartin. Them as sees ghosts sees 'em any time. Every morning, just at\r\npeep o' day, she comes out of that door and makes a dive for the stairs.\r\nShe just gives me one look, and holds up her hand, and I don't see no\r\nmore of her till next time.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does she look?\" I almost hoped he would not tell, but he did.\r\n\r\n\"She's got hair as black as a coal, kind o' pushed back, as if she'd\r\nbeen runnin' her hands through it; she has big shiny eyes, swelled up as\r\nshe'd been cryin' a great while; and she's always got on a gray dress,\r\nsilvery-like, with a tear in one sleeve. There ain't nothin' more, only\r\na handkerchief tied round her wrist, as if it had been hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she handsome?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe white folks'd think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why does she show herself to you and no one else, do you suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I tell you the reason before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, she looked just so the last time I seen her alive. I\r\nmust go and put in the biscuit now, miss.\"\r\n\r\nI submitted, knowing that white folks may be hurried, but black ones\r\nnever; and I could not but admire the natural talent which Pedro shared\r\nwith the authors of continued stories, of always dropping the thread at\r\nthe most thrilling moment.\r\n\r\n\"Who was she?\" said I, lying in wait for him on his return.\r\n\r\n\"She was cap'n's wife, miss--a young woman, and the cap'n was old, with\r\na blazing kind of temper. He was dreffle sweet on her for about a month,\r\nand mebbe she was happy, mebbe she wa'n't: how should I know about white\r\nfolks' feelin's? All of a suddent he said she was sick and couldn't go\r\nout of the middle state-room. The old man took in plenty of stuff to\r\neat, but he never let me go near her. We was on just such a v'y'ge as\r\nthis, only hotter. The cap'n would come out of that room lookin' black\r\nas thunder, and everybody scudded out of his sight when he put his head\r\nout of the gangway.\r\n\r\n\"He was always bad enough, but he got wuss and wuss, and nothin'\r\ncouldn't please him. Sometimes I'd hear the poor thing a-moaning to\r\nherself like a baby that's beat out with loud cryin' and hain't got no\r\nnoise left. She was always cryin' in them days. Once the supercargo (he\r\nwas a cool hand, any way) give me a bit of paper very private to give to\r\nher, and I slipped it under the door, but the old man had nailed\r\nsomethin' down inside, an' he found it afore she did. Then there was a\r\nregular knockdown fight, and the supercargo was put in irons. The old\r\nman was in the middle room a long time that day, talkin' in a hissin'\r\nkind of a way, and the missus got a blow. Just after that a sort of a\r\nwhite squall struck the ship, and the old man give just the wrong\r\norders. You see, he was clean out of his head. He got so worked up at\r\nlast that he fell down in a fit, and they bundled him into his\r\nstate-room and left him, 'cause nobody cared whether he was dead or\r\nalive. The mate took the irons off the supercargo first thing, and broke\r\nopen the middle room. The supercargo went in there and stayed a long\r\ntime, whispering to the missus, and she cried more'n ever, only it\r\nsounded different.\r\n\r\n\"Toward night the old man come to, and begun to ask questions--as ugly\r\nas ever, only as weak as a baby. 'Bout midnight I was comin' out of his\r\nroom, and I seen the missus in a gray dress, with her eyes shinin' like\r\ncoals of fire, dive out of her room and up the stairs, and nobody never\r\nseen her afterward. The next morning the supercargo was gone too, and I\r\nthink they just drownded themselves, 'cause they couldn't bear to live\r\nany more without each other. Mebbe the mate knew somethin' about it, but\r\nhe never let on, and I dunno no more about it; only the old man had\r\nanother fit when he heard it, and died without no mourners.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be she was saved, after all,\" I said, with true Yankee\r\nskepticism.\r\n\r\n\"Then why should I see her ghost, if she ain't dead-drownded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you never find anything in the state-room that would explain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I did find some bits of paper, but I couldn't read writin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what did you do with them?\" I insisted, quivering with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"You won't tell the cap'n?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, never.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll give 'em back to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes--of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here they be,\" he said, opening his shirt, and showing a little bag\r\nhung round his neck like an amulet. He took out a little wad of brown\r\npaper, and gave it jealously into my hand.\r\n\r\n\"I will give it back to you to-night,\" I said with the solemnity of an\r\noath, and carried it to my room.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a short and fragmentary account of the sufferings which\r\nthe \"missus\" had endured in the middle room, written in pencil on coarse\r\nwrapping-paper, and bearing marks of trembling hands and frequent tears.\r\nI thought I might copy the papers without breaking faith with Pedro. The\r\noutside paper bore these words:\r\n\r\n\"Whoever finds this is besought for pity's sake, by its most unhappy\r\nwriter, to send it as soon as possible to Mrs. Jane Atwood of\r\nDavidsville, Connecticut, United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed a letter to her mother:\r\n\r\nDearest Mother: If I never see your blessed face again, I know you will\r\nnot believe me guilty of what my husband accuses me of. I married\r\nCaptain Eliot for your sake, believing, since Herbert had proved\r\nfaithless, that no comfort was left to me except in pleasing others. I\r\nmeant to be a good wife to Captain Eliot, and I believe I should have\r\nkept my vow all my days if the most unfortunate thing had not wakened\r\nhis jealousy. Since then he has been almost or quite crazed.\r\n\r\nI knew we had a supercargo of whom Captain Eliot spoke highly. He kept\r\nhis room for a month from sea-sickness, and when he came out it was\r\nHerbert. Of course I knew him, every line of his face had been so long\r\nwritten on my heart. I strove to treat him as if I had never seen him\r\nbefore, but the old familiar looks and tones were very hard to bear. If\r\nHerbert could only have submitted patiently to our fate! But it was not\r\nin him to be patient under anything, and one evening, when I was sitting\r\nalone on deck, he must needs pour out his soul in one great burst,\r\ntrying to prove that he had never deserted me, but only circumstances\r\nhad been cruel. I longed to believe him, but I could only keep repeating\r\nthat it was too late.\r\n\r\nWhen I went down, Captain Eliot dragged me into the middle state-room,\r\nand gave vent to his jealous feelings. He must have listened to all that\r\nHerbert had said. His last words were that I should never leave that\r\nroom alive. I had a wretched night, and the first time I fell into an\r\nuneasy sleep I started suddenly up to find my husband flashing the light\r\nof a lantern across my eyes. \"Handsome and wicked,\" he muttered--\"they\r\nalways go together.\"\r\n\r\nI begged him to listen to the story of my engagement to Herbert, and he\r\ndid listen, but it did not soften his heart. If he ever loved me, his\r\njealousy has swallowed it up.\r\n\r\nI have been in this room just a week. My husband does not starve or beat\r\nme, but his taunts and threats are fearful, and his eyes when he looks\r\nat me grow wild, as if he had the longing of a beast to tear me in\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_May_ 10. I placed a copy of the paper that is pinned to this letter in\r\na little bottle that had escaped my husband's search, and threw it out\r\nof my window.\r\n\r\nI am Waitstill Atwood Eliot, wife of Captain Eliot of the ship Sapphire.\r\nI have been kept in solitary confinement and threatened with death for\r\nfour weeks, for no just cause. I believe him to be insane, as he\r\nconstantly threatens to burn or sink the ship. I pray that this paper\r\nmay be picked up by some one who will board this ship and bring me help.\r\n\r\nOf course it is a most forlorn hope, but it keeps me from utter despair.\r\n\r\n20. Herbert tried to communicate with me by slipping a paper under the\r\ndoor, but I did not get it, and he has been put in irons. Captain Eliot\r\nboasts of it. I wish he would bind us together and let us drown in one\r\nanother's arms, as they did in the Huguenot persecution.\r\n\r\n28. A little paper tied to a string hung in front of my bull's-eye\r\nwindow to-day: I took it in. The first officer had lowered it down:\r\n\"Captain Eliot says you are ill, but I don't believe it. If he tries\r\nviolence, scream, and I will break open the door. I am always on the\r\nwatch. Keep your heart up.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a drop of comfort in my black cup, but my little window was\r\nscrewed down within an hour after I had read the paper.\r\n\r\n_June_ 10. My spirit is worn out: I can endure no more. I have begged my\r\nhusband to kill me and end my misery. I don't know why he hesitated. He\r\nmeans to do it some time, but perhaps he cannot think of torture\r\nexquisite enough for his purpose.\r\n\r\n11. My husband came in about four in the afternoon, looking so\r\nvindictive that my heart stood still. He gradually worked himself into a\r\nfrenzy, and aimed a blow at my head: instinct, rather than the love of\r\nlife, made me parry it, and I got the stroke on my wrist.\r\n\r\nI screamed, and at the same moment there was a tumult on deck, and the\r\nship quivered as if she too had been violently struck. Captain Eliot\r\nrushed on deck, and began to give hurried orders. I could hear the first\r\nofficer contradict them, and then there was a heavy fall, and two or\r\nthree men stumbled down the cabin stairs, carrying some weight between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Later_. My husband is helpless, and Herbert has been with me, urging me\r\npassionately to trust myself to him in a little boat at midnight. He\r\nsays there are several ships in sight, and one of them will be almost\r\nsure to pick us up. He swears that he will leave me, and never see me\r\nagain (if I say so), so soon as he has placed me in safety, but he will\r\nsave me, by force if need be, from the brute into whose hands I fell so\r\ninnocently. If the ship does not see us, it is but dying, after all.\r\n\r\nGood-bye, mother! I pray that this paper will reach you before Captain\r\nEliot can send you his own account, but if it does not, you will believe\r\nme innocent all the same.\r\n\r\nThis was the last, and I folded up the papers as they had come to me.\r\nThat night I read them all to Pedro.\r\n\r\n\"They was drownded--I knew it,\" said Pedro; and nothing could remove\r\nthat opinion. A ghost is more convincing than logic.\r\n\r\nOur voyage wore on, with one day just like another: my brother looked at\r\nthe sun every day, and put down a few cabalistic figures on a slate, but\r\nhis steady business was reading novels to his wife and drinking weak\r\nclaret and water.\r\n\r\nThe sea was always the same, smiling and smooth, and the \"man at the\r\nwheel\" seemed to be always holding us back by main strength from the\r\nplace where we wanted to go. I had a growing belief that we should sail\r\nfor ever on this rippling mirror and never touch the frame of it. It\r\nstruck me with a sense of intense surprise when a dark line loomed far\r\nahead, and they told me quietly that that line meant Bombay.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a matter of course to my brother that the desired port should\r\nheave in sight just when he expected it, but to me the efforts that he\r\nhad made to accomplish this tremendous result were ridiculously small.\r\n\r\n\"I have done more work in a week, and had nothing to show for it at\r\nlast,\" said I, \"than you have seemed to do in all this voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor sister! don't you wish you were a man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, all women do who have any sense. I hold with that ancient\r\nFather of the Church who maintained that all women are changed into men\r\non the judgment-day. The council said it was heresy, but that don't\r\nalter my faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't like you half as well if you had been born a boy,\" said\r\nFrank.\r\n\r\n\"But I should like myself vastly better,\" said I, clinging to the last\r\nword.\r\n\r\nBombay is a city by itself: there is none like it on earth, whatever\r\nthere may be in the heaven above or in the waters under it. From Sir\r\nJamsetjee Jeejeebhoy's hospital for sick animals to the Olympian conceit\r\nof the English residents, there are infinite variations of people and\r\nthings that I am persuaded can be matched nowhere else. I felt myself\r\nliving in a series of pictures, a sort of supernumerary in a theatre,\r\nwhere they changed the play every night.\r\n\r\nOne of the first who boarded our ship was Mr. Rayne, an old friend of\r\nFrank's. He insisted on our going to his house for a few days in a\r\nwarm-hearted way that was irresistible.\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite sure you want _me_?\" I said dubiously. \"Young married\r\npeople make a kind of heaven for themselves, and do not want old maids\r\nlooking over the wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you _must_ go with us,\" said Frank, man-like, never seeing anything\r\nbut the uppermost surface of a question.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. I'm quite strong-minded enough to stay on board ship; or,\r\nif that would not do in this heathen place, the missionaries are always\r\nready to entertain strangers. A week in the missionhouse would make me\r\nfor ever a shining light in the sewing circle at home.\r\n\r\n\"A woman of so many resources would be welcome anywhere. For my part, an\r\nold maid is a perfect Godsend. The genus is unknown here, and the loss\r\nto society immense,\" said Mr. Rayne.\r\n\r\n\"But what shall I do when Mrs. Rayne and my sister-in-law are comparing\r\nnotes about the perfections of their husbands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Walk on the verandah with me and convert me to woman suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rayne had his barouche waiting on shore, and drove us first to the\r\nbandstand, where, in the coolness of sunset, all the Bombay world meet\r\nto see and to be seen. When the band paused, people drove slowly round\r\nthe circle, seeking acquaintance. Among them one equipage was perfect--a\r\nsmall basket-phaeton, and two black ponies groomed within an inch of\r\ntheir lives. My eyes fell on the ponies first, but I saw them no more\r\nwhen the lady who drove them turned her face toward me.\r\n\r\nShe wore a close-fitting black velvet habit and a little round hat with\r\nlong black feather. Her hair might have been black velvet, too, as it\r\nfell low on her forehead, and was fastened somehow behind in a heavy\r\ncoil. Black brows and lashes shaded clear gray eyes--the softest gray,\r\nwithout the least tint of green in them--such eyes as Quaker maidens\r\nought to have under their gray bonnets. Little rose colored flushes kept\r\ncoming and going in her cheeks as she talked.\r\n\r\nAll at once I thought of Queen Guinevere,\r\n\r\n    As she fled fast thro' sun and shade,\r\n      With jingling bridle-reins.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rayne, do you see that lady in black, with the ponies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were a man, that woman would be my Fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought women never admired each other's beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken. Heretofore I have met beautiful women only in poetry.\r\nDo you remember four lines about Queen Guinevere?--no, six lines, I\r\nmean:\r\n\r\n    \"She looked so lovely as she swayed\r\n      The rein with dainty finger-tips,\r\n    A man had given all other bliss,\r\n    And all his worldly worth for this,\r\n    To waste his whole heart in one kiss\r\n      Upon her perfect lips.\r\n\r\n\"I always thought them overstrained till now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I perfectly agree with you,\" said Mr. Rayne: \"I knew we were congenial\r\nspirits.\" Then he said a word or two in a diabolical language to his\r\ngroom, who ran to the carriage which I had been watching and repeated it\r\nto the lady: she bowed and smiled to Mr. Rayne, and soon drew up her\r\nponies beside us.\r\n\r\n\"My wife,\" said Mr. Rayne with laughter in his eyes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rayne talked much like other people, and her beauty ceased to\r\ndazzle me after a few minutes; not that it grew less on near view, but,\r\nbeing a woman, I could not fall in love with her in the nature of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nWhen the music stopped we drove to Mr. Rayne's house, his wife keeping\r\neasily beside us. When she was occupied with the others Mr. Rayne\r\nwhispered, \"Her praises were so sweet in my ears that I would not own\r\nmyself Sir Lancelot at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are Sir Lancelot,\" I said, \"where is King Arthur?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty fathoms deep, I hope,\" said Mr. Rayne with a sudden change in his\r\nvoice and a darkening face. I had raised a ghost for him without knowing\r\nit, and he spoke no more till we reached the house.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, low, spreading structure with a thatched roof, and a\r\nverandah round it. A wilderness of tropical plants hemmed it in. But all\r\nappearance of simplicity vanished on our entrance. In the matted hall\r\nstood a tree to receive the light coverings we had worn; not a \"hat\r\ntree,\" as we say at home by poetic license, but the counterfeit\r\npresentment of a real tree, carved in branches and delicate foliage out\r\nof black wood. The drawing-room was eight-sided, and would have held,\r\nwith some margin, the gambrel-roofed house, chimneys and all, in which I\r\nhad spent my life. Two sides were open into other rooms, with Corinthian\r\npillars reaching to the roof. Carved screens a little higher than our\r\nheads filled the space between the pillars, and separated the\r\ndrawing-room from Mrs. Rayne's boudoir on the side and the dining-room\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nThe furniture of these rooms was like so many verses of a poem. Every\r\nchair and table had been designed by Mrs. Rayne, and then realized in\r\nblack wood by the patient hands of natives.\r\n\r\nAnother side opened by three glass doors on a verandah, and only a few\r\nrods below the house the sea dashed against a beach.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I sat on the verandah drinking coffee and the sea-breeze by\r\nturns. The gentlemen walked up and down smoking the pipe of peace, while\r\nMrs. Rayne sat within, talking with Rhoda in the candlelight. Opposite\r\nme, as I looked in at the open door, hung two Madonnas, the Sistine and\r\nthe Virgin of the Immaculate Conception. In front of each stood a tall\r\nflower-stand carved to imitate the leaves and blossoms of the calla\r\nlily. These black flowers held great bunches of the Annunciation lily,\r\nsacred to the Virgin through all the ages. Mrs. Rayne had taken off the\r\nclose-buttoned jacket, and her dress was now open at the throat, with\r\nsome rich old lace clinging about it and fastened with a pearl daisy.\r\n\r\n\"Have you forgiven me the minute's deception I put upon you?\" said Mr.\r\nRayne, pausing beside me. \"If I had not read admiration in your face, I\r\nwould have told you the truth at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could one help admiring her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, I'm sure: I never could.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has the serenest face, like still, shaded water. I wonder how she\r\nwould look in trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not becoming to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your way of life here seems so perfect! No hurry nor worry--nothing to\r\nmake wrinkles.\"\r\n\r\n\"You like this smooth Indian living, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Like it_! I hope you won't think me wholly given over to love of\r\nthings that perish in the using, but if I could live this sort of life\r\nwith the one I liked best, heaven would be a superfluity.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is heaven indeed when I think of the purgatory from which we came\r\ninto it,\" said Mr. Rayne, throwing away his cigar and carrying off my\r\ncoffee-cup.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything of Mrs. Rayne's history before her marriage?\" I\r\nsaid to Frank as I joined him in his walk.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing to speak of--only she was a widow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said I, feeling that a spot or two had suddenly appeared on the\r\nface of the sun.\r\n\r\n\"That's nothing against her, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I have no patience with second marriages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor first ones, either,\" said Frank wickedly.\r\n\r\n\"But seriously, Frank--would you like to have a wife so beautiful as\r\nMrs. Rayne?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if she had Rhoda's soul inside of her,\" said Frank stoutly.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because all sorts of eyes gloat on her beauty and drink it in, and in\r\none way appropriate it to themselves. Mr. Rayne is as proud of the\r\nadmiration given to his wife as if it were a personal tribute to his own\r\ntaste in selecting her. A beautiful woman never really and truly belongs\r\nto her husband unless he can keep a veil over her face, as the Turks\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew you had 'views,'\" said Mr. Rayne behind me, \"but I had no idea\r\nthey were so heathenish. What is New England coming to under the new\r\nrule? Are the plain women going to shut up all the handsome ones?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was only supposing a case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppositions are dangerous. You first endure, then dally with them, and\r\nfinally embrace them as established facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was only saying that if I am a man when I come into the world next\r\ntime (as the Hindoos say), I shall marry a plain woman with a charming\r\ndisposition, and so, as it were, have my diamond all to myself by reason\r\nof its dull cover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jealousy, thy name is woman!\" said Mr. Rayne. \"When the Woman's\r\nRepublic is set up, how I shall pity the handsome ones!\"\r\n\r\n\"They will all be banished to some desert island,\" said Frank.\r\n\r\n\"And draw all men after them, as the 'Pied Piper of Hamelin' did the\r\nrats,\" said Mr. Rayne.\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Mrs. Rayne, joining us at this point.\r\n\r\n\"The pity of it,\" said her husband, \"that beauty is only skin deep.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is deep enough,\" said Mrs. Rayne.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if age and sickness and trouble did not make one shed it so soon,\"\r\nsaid I ungratefully.\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" said Mrs. Rayne--\"'tis bad enough when it comes. Do\r\nyou remember that Greek woman in _Lothair,_ whose father was so\r\nfearfully rich that she seemed to be all crusted with precious stones?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"To dance and sing was all she lived for, and Lothair must needs bring\r\nin the skeleton, as you did, by reminding her of the dolorous time when\r\nshe would neither dance nor sing. You think she is crushed, to be sure,\r\nonly Disraeli's characters never are crushed, any more than himself. 'Oh\r\nthen,' she says, 'we will be part of the audience, and other people will\r\ndance and sing for us.' So beauty is always with us, though one person\r\nloses it.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a little shrug of her shoulders, which made her pearls and\r\nvelvet shimmer in the moonlight. She looked so white and cool and\r\nperfect, so apart from common clay, that all at once Queen Guinevere\r\nceased to be my type of her, and I thought of \"Lilith, first wife of\r\nAdam,\" as we see her in Rossetti's fanciful poem:\r\n\r\n    Not a drop of her blood was human,\r\n    But she was made like a soft, sweet woman.\r\n\r\nWe all went to our rooms after this, and in each of ours hung a\r\nfull-length swinging mirror; I had never seen one before, except in a\r\npicture-shop or in a hotel.\r\n\r\n\"Truly this is 'richness'!\" I said, walking up and down and sideways\r\nfrom one to the other.\r\n\r\n\"I had no idea you had so much vanity,\" said Frank, laughing at me, as\r\nhe has done ever since he was born.\r\n\r\n\"Vanity! not a spark. I am only seeing myself as others see me, for the\r\nfirst time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I always had a glass like that in my room at home,\" said my\r\nsister-in-law, with the least morsel of disdain in her tone.\r\n\r\n\"Had you? Then you have lost a great deal by growing up to such things.\r\nA first sensation at my age is delightful.\"\r\n\r\nNext day Rhoda and I were sitting with Mrs. Rayne in her dressing-room,\r\nwith a great fan swinging overhead. We all had books in our hands, but I\r\nfound more charming reading in my hostess, whose fascinations hourly\r\ngrew upon me.\r\n\r\nShe wore a long loose wrapper, clear blue in color, with little silver\r\nstars on it. I don't know how much of my admiration sprang from her\r\nperfect taste in dress. Raiment has an extraordinary effect on the whole\r\nmachinery of life. Most people think too lightly of it. Somebody says if\r\nCleopatra's nose had been a quarter of an inch shorter, the history of\r\nthe world would have been utterly changed; but Antony might equally have\r\nbeen proof against a robe with high neck and tight sleeves. Mrs. Rayne's\r\nface always seemed to crown her costume like a rose out of green leaves,\r\nyet I cannot but think that if I had seen her first in a calico gown and\r\nsitting on a three-legged stool milking a cow, I should still have\r\nthought her a queen among women.\r\n\r\nWhile I sat like a lotos-eater, forgetful of home and butter-making, a\r\nservant brought in a parcel and a note. Mrs. Rayne tossed the note to me\r\nwhile she unfolded a roll of gray silk.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Guinevere: I send with this a bit of silk that old Fut'ali insisted\r\non giving to me this morning. It is that horrid gray color which we both\r\ndetest. I know you will never wear it, and you had better give it to\r\nMiss Blake to make a toga for her first appearance in the women's\r\nSenate. LANCELOT.\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart!\" said Mrs. Rayne as I gave back the note. \"You will\r\nplease us both far more than you can please yourself by wearing the\r\ndress with a thought of us. I wonder why Mr. Rayne calls me 'Guinevere'?\r\nBut he has a new name for me every day, because he does not like my\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Waitstill. Did you ever hear it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never but once,\" I said with a sudden tightness in my throat. I could\r\nscarcely speak my thanks for the dress.\r\n\r\n\"I should never wear it,\" said Mrs. Rayne: \"the color is associated with\r\na very painful part of my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose water would spot it?\" asked Rhoda, who is of a practical\r\nturn of mind.\r\n\r\n\"Take a bit and try it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Water spots some grays\" said Mrs. Rayne with a strange sort of smile as\r\nRhoda went out, \"especially salt water. I spent one night at sea in an\r\nopen boat, with a gray dress clinging wet and salt to my limbs. When I\r\ntore it off in rags I seemed to shed all the misery I had ever known.\r\nAll my life since then has been bright as you see it now. It would be a\r\nbad omen to put on a gray gown again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have made a sea-voyage, Mrs. Rayne?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, such a long voyage!--worse than the 'Ancient Mariner's.' No words\r\ncan tell how I hate the sea.\" She sighed deeply, with a sudden darkening\r\nof her gray eyes till they were almost black, and grasped one wrist hard\r\nwith the other hand.\r\n\r\nA sudden trembling seized me. I was almost as much agitated as Mrs.\r\nRayne. I felt that I must clinch the matter somehow, but I took refuge\r\nin a platitude to gain time: \"There is such a difference in ships,\r\nalmost as much as in houses, and the comfort of the voyage depends\r\ngreatly on that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be so,\" she said wearily.\r\n\r\n\"My brother's ship is old, but it has been refitted lately to something\r\nlike comfort. It's old name was the Sapphire.\"\r\n\r\nThis was my shot, and it hit hard.\r\n\r\n\"The Sapphire! the Sapphire!\" she whispered with dilated eyes. \"Did you\r\never hear--did you ever find--But what nonsense! You must think me the\r\nabsurdest of women.\"\r\n\r\nThe color came back to her face, and she laughed quite naturally.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, Miss Blake, I was very ill and miserable when I was on\r\nshipboard, and to this day any sudden reminder of it gives me a\r\nshock.--Did water spot it?\" she said to Rhoda, who came in at this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nI thought over all the threads of the circumstance that had come into my\r\nhand, and like Mr. Browning's lover I found \"a thing to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning I made an excuse to go down to the ship with my\r\nbrother, and there, by dint of pressure, I got those stained and dingy\r\npapers into my possession again. I had only that day before me, for we\r\nwere going to a hotel the same evening, and the Raynes were to set out\r\nnext day for their summer place among the hills, a long way back of\r\nBombay. Our stay had already delayed their departure.\r\n\r\nThis was my plot: Mrs. Rayne had been reading a book that I had bought\r\nfor the home-voyage, and was to finish it before evening. I selected the\r\nduplicate of the paper which \"Waitstill Atwood Eliot\" had put in a\r\nbottle and cast adrift when her case had been desperate, and laid it in\r\nthe book a page or two beyond Mrs. Rayne's mark. It seemed impossible\r\nthat she could miss it: I watched her as a chemist watches his first\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nTwice she took up the book, and was interrupted before she could open\r\nit: the third time she sat down so close to me that the folds of her\r\ndress touched mine. One page, two pages: in another instant she would\r\nhave turned the leaf, and I held my breath, when a servant brought in a\r\nnote. Her most intimate friend had been thrown from her carriage, and\r\nhad sent for her. It was a matter of life and death, and brooked no\r\ndelay. In ten minutes she had bidden us a cordial good-bye, and dropped\r\nout of my life for all time.\r\n\r\nShe never finished _my_ book, nor I _hers_. I had had it in my heart, in\r\nreturn for her warm hospitality, to cast a great stone out of her past\r\nlife into the still waters of her present, and her good angel had turned\r\nit aside just before it reached her. I might have asked Mr. Rayne in so\r\nmany words if his wife's name had been Waitstill Atwood Eliot when he\r\nmarried her, but that would have savored of treachery to her, and I\r\nrefrained.\r\n\r\nOften in the long calm days of the home-voyage, and oftener still in the\r\nnight-watches, I pondered in my heart the items of Mrs. Rayne's history,\r\nand pieced them together like bits of mosaic--the gray eyes and the gray\r\ndress, the identity of name, the indefinite terrors of her sea-voyage,\r\nthe little touch concerning Lancelot and Guinevere, her emotion when I\r\nmentioned the Sapphire. If circumstantial evidence can be trusted, I\r\nfeel certain that Pedro's ghost appeared to me in the flesh.\r\n\r\nELLA WILLIAMS THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES OF FLORENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had six months more to stay on the Continent, and I began for the\r\nfirst time to be discontented in Paris. There was no soul in that great\r\ncity whom I had ever seen before, but this alone would hot have been\r\nsufficient to make me long for a change, except for an accident which\r\nunluckily surrounded me with my own countrymen. These I did not go\r\nabroad to see; and having lived almost entirely in the society of the\r\nFrench for over two years, it was with dismay that I saw my sanctum\r\ninvaded daily by twos and threes of the aimless American nonentities who\r\npresume that their presence must be agreeable to any of their\r\ncountrymen, and especially to any countrywoman, after a chance\r\nintroduction on the boulevard or an hour spent together in a café.\r\n\r\n\"Seeing these things,\" I determined to leave Paris, and the third day\r\nafter found me traveling through picturesque Savoy toward Mont Cenis.\r\nAll the afternoon the rugged hills had been growing higher and whiter\r\nwith snow, and now, just before sunset, we reached the railway terminus,\r\nSt. Michel, and were under the shadow of the Alps themselves.\r\n\r\nThe previous night in the cars I had found myself the only woman among\r\nsome half dozen French military officers, who paid me the most polite\r\nattention. They were charmed that I made no objection to their\r\ncigarettes, talked with me on various topics, criticised McClellan as a\r\ngeneral, and were enthusiastic on the subject of our country generally.\r\nAbout midnight they prepared a grand repast from their traveling-bags,\r\nto which they gave me a cordial invitation. I begged to contribute my\r\n_mesquin_ supply of grapes and brioches, and the supper was a\r\nconsiderable event. Their canteens were filled with red wines, and one\r\ncup served the whole company. They drank my health and that of the\r\nPresident of the United States. Afterward we had vocal music, two of the\r\nofficers being good singers. They sang Beranger's songs and the charming\r\nserenade from _Lalla Rookh_. I finally expressed a desire to hear the\r\nMarseillaise. This seemed to take them by surprise, but one of the\r\nsingers, declaring that he had _\"rien à refuser à madame\"_ boldly struck\r\nup,\r\n\r\n    Allons, enfants de la patrie,\r\n    Le jour de gloire est arrivé;\r\n\r\nbut his companions checked him before he had finished the first stanza.\r\nThe law forbade, they said, the production of the Marseillaise in\r\nsociety. We were a society: the guard would hear us and might report it.\r\n\r\n\"Vous voyez, madame,\" said the singer, \"n'il n'est pas défendu d'être\r\nvoleur, mais c'est défendu d'être attrapé\" (It is not against the law to\r\nbe a thief, but to be caught.)\r\n\r\nMy traveling--companions reached their destination early in the morning,\r\nand, very gallantly expressing regrets that they were not going over the\r\nAlps, so as to bear mer company, bade me farewell.\r\n\r\nFrom the rear of the St. Michel hotel, called the Lion d'Or, I watched\r\nthe preparations for crossing Mont Cenis. Three diligences were being\r\ncrazily loaded with our baggage. The men who loaded them seemed\r\nimitating the Alpine structure. They piled trunk on trunk to the height\r\nof thirty feet, I verily believe; and if some one should nudge my elbow\r\nand say \"fifty,\" I should write it down so without manifesting the least\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nWhen the preparations were finished the setting sun was shining clearly\r\non the white summits above, and we commenced slowly winding up the noble\r\nzigzag road. Rude mountain children kept up with our diligences, asked\r\nfor sous and wished us _bon voyage_ in the name of the Virgin.\r\n\r\nThe grandeur, but especially the extent and number, of the Alpine peaks\r\nimpressed me with a vague, undefinable sense, which was not, I think,\r\nthe anticipated sensation; and indeed if I had been in a poetic mood, it\r\nwould have been quickly dissipated by the mock raptures of a young\r\nEnglishman with a poodly moustache and an eye-glass. He called our\r\nattention to every chasm, gorge and waterfall, as if we had been wholly\r\nincapable of seeing or appreciating anything without his aid. As for me,\r\nI did not feel like disputing his susceptibility. I was suffering an\r\nuneasy apprehension of an avalanche--not of snow, but of trunks and\r\nboxes from the topheavy diligences ahead of us. However, we reached the\r\ntop of Mont Cenis safely by means of thirteen mules to each coach,\r\nattached tandem, and we stopped at the queer relay-house there some\r\nthirty minutes. Here some women in the garb of nuns served me some soup\r\nwith grated cheese, a compound which suggested a dishcloth in flavor,\r\nyet it was very good. I will not attempt to reconcile the two\r\nstatements. After the soup I went out to see the Alps. The ecstatic\r\nBriton was still eating and drinking, and I could enjoy the scene\r\nunmolested. I crossed a little bridge near the inn. The night was cold\r\nand bright. Hundreds of snowy peaks above, below and in every direction,\r\nsome of their hoary heads lost in the clouds, were glistening in the\r\nlight of a clear September moon, and the stillness was only broken by a\r\nwild stream tumbling down the precipices which I looked up to as I\r\ncrossed the bridge. It was indeed an impressive scene--cold, desolate,\r\nawful. I walked so near the freezing cataract that the icicles touched\r\nmy face, and thinking that Dante, when he wrote his description of hell,\r\nmight have been inspired by this very scene, I wrapped my cloak closer\r\nabout me and went back to the inn.\r\n\r\nThe diligences were ready, and we commenced a descent which I cannot\r\neven now think of without a shudder. To each of those heavily-laden\r\nstages were attached two horses only, and we bounded down the\r\nmountain-side like a huge loosened boulder. Imagine the sensation as\r\nyou looked out of the windows and saw yourself whirling over yawning\r\nchasms and along the brinks of dizzy precipices, fully convinced that\r\nthe driver was drunk and the horses goaded to madness by Alpine demons!\r\nI have been on the ocean in a storm sufficiently severe to make Jew and\r\nChristian pray amicably together; I have been set on fire by a fluid\r\nlamp, and have been dragged under the water by a drowning friend, but I\r\nthink I never had such an alarming sense of coming destruction as in\r\nthat diligence. I think of those sure-footed horses even now with\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Susa a long time before daylight. At first, I decided to\r\nstay and see this town, which was founded by a Roman colony in the time\r\nof Augustus. The arch built in his honor about eight years before Christ\r\nseemed a thing worth going to see; but a remark from my companion with\r\nthe eye-glass made me determine to go on. He said he was going to \"do\"\r\nthe arch, and I knew I should not be equal to witnessing any more of his\r\necstasies.\r\n\r\nMy first astonishment in Italy was that hardly any of the railroad\r\nofficials spoke French. I had always been told that with that language\r\nat your command you could travel all over the Continent. This is a grave\r\nerror: even in Florence, although \"Ici on parle français\" is conspicuous\r\nin many shop-windows, I found I had to speak Italian or go unserved. I\r\nhad a mortal dread of murdering the beautiful Italian language; so I\r\nwanted to speak it well before I commenced, like the Irishman who never\r\ncould get his boots on until he had worn them a week.\r\n\r\nI stopped at Turin, then the capital of Italy, only a short time, and\r\nhurried on to Florence, for that was to be my home for the winter. It\r\nwas delightful to come down from the Alpine snows and find myself face\r\nto face with roses and orange trees bearing fruit and blossom. Here I\r\nwandered through the olive-gardens alone, and gave way to the rapturous\r\nsense of simply being in the land of art and romance, the land of love\r\nand song; for there was no ecstatic person with me armed with _Murray_\r\nand prepared to admire anything recommended therein. Besides, I could\r\nenjoy Italy for days and months, and therefore was not obliged to \"do\"\r\n(detestable tourist slang!) anything in a given time. I was free as a\r\nbird. I knew no Americans in Florence, and determined to studiously\r\navoid making acquaintances except among Italians, for I wished to learn\r\nthe language as I had learned French, by constantly speaking it and no\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe day following my arrival in Florence I went out to look for\r\nlodgings, which I had the good fortune to find immediately. I secured\r\nthe first I looked at. They were in the Borgo SS. Apostoli, in close\r\nproximity to the Piazza del Granduca, now Delia Signoria. I was passing\r\nthis square, thinking of my good luck in finding my niche for the\r\nwinter, when, much to my surprise, some one accosted me in English.\r\nThink of my dismay at seeing one of the irrepressible Paris bores I had\r\nfled from! He was in Florence before me, having come by a different\r\nroute; and neither of us had known anything about the other's intention\r\nto quit Paris. He asked me at once where I was stopping, and I told him\r\nat the Hotel a la Fontana, not deeming it necessary to add that I was\r\nthen on my way there to pack up my traveling-bag and pay my bill. As he\r\nwas \"doing\" Florence in about three days, he never found me out. The\r\nnext I heard of him he was \"doing\" Rome. This American prided himself on\r\nhis knowledge of Italian; and one day in a restaurant, wishing for\r\ncauliflower _(cavolo fiore)_, he astonished the waiter by calling for\r\n_horse. \"Cavallo\"!_ he roared--\"_Portéz me cavallo!_\" \"Cavallo!\"\r\nrepeated the waiter, with the characteristic Italian shrug. \"_Non\r\nsimangia in Italia, signore_\" (It is not eaten in Italy, signore). Then\r\nfollowed more execrable Italian, and the waiter brought him something\r\nwhich elicited \"_Non volo! non volo!_\" (I don't fly! I don't fly!) from\r\nthe American, and \"_Lo credo, signore_\" from the baffled waiter, much to\r\nthe amusement of people at the adjacent tables.\r\n\r\nI liked my new quarters very much. They consisted of two goodly-sized\r\nrooms, carpeted with thick braided rag carpets, and decently furnished,\r\nolive oil provided for the quaint old classic-shaped lamp, and the rooms\r\nkept in order, for the astounding price of thirty francs a month. Wood I\r\nhad to pay extra for when I needed a fire, and that indeed was\r\nexpensive; for a bundle only sufficient to make a fire cost a franc.\r\nThere were few days, however, even in that exceptional winter, which\r\nrendered a fire necessary. The _scaldino_ for the feet was generally\r\nsufficient, and this, replenished three times a day, was included in the\r\nrent.\r\n\r\nOne of my windows looked out on olive-gardens and on the old church San\r\nMiniato, on the hill of the same name. Mr. Hart, the sculptor, told me\r\nthat those rooms were very familiar to him. Buchanan Read, I think he\r\nsaid, had occupied them, and the walls in many places bore traces of\r\nartist vagaries. There were several nice caricatures penciled among the\r\ncheap frescoes of the walls. All the walls are frescoed in Florence.\r\nThink of having your ceiling and walls painted in a manner that\r\nconstantly suggests Michael Angelo!\r\n\r\nAfter some weeks spent in looking at the art-wonders in Florence, I\r\nvisited many of the studios of our artists. That of Mr. Hart, on the\r\nPiazza Independenza, was one of the most interesting. He had two very\r\nadmirable busts of Henry Clay, and all his visitors, encouraged by his\r\nfrank manner, criticised his works freely. Most people boldly pass\r\njudgment on any work of art, and \"understand\" Mrs. Browning when she\r\nsays the Venus de' Medici \"thunders white silence.\" I do not. I am sure\r\nI never can understand what a thundering silence means, whatever may be\r\nits color. These appreciators talked of the \"word-painting\" of Mrs.\r\nBrowning.\r\n\r\n    They sit on their thrones in a purple sublimity,\r\n    And grind down men's bones to a pale unanimity.\r\n\r\nI suppose this is \"word-painting.\" I can see the picture\r\nalso--some kings, and possibly queens, seated on gorgeous thrones,\r\nengaged in the festive occupation of grinding bones! Oh, I degrade the\r\nsubject, do I? Nonsense! The term is a stilted affectation, perhaps\r\nnever better applied than to Mrs. Browning's descriptive spasms. Still,\r\nshe was undoubtedly a poet. She wrote many beautiful subjective poems,\r\nbut she wrote much that was not poetry, and which suggests only a\r\nderanged nervous system. I have a friend who maintains from her writings\r\nthat she never loved, that she did not know what passion meant. However\r\nthis may be, the author of the sonnet commencing--\r\n\r\n    Go from me! Yet I feel that I shall stand\r\n      Henceforward in thy shadow,\r\n\r\ndeserves immortality.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Mr. Hart's studio. One of the most remarkable things I\r\nsaw in Florence was this artist's invention to reduce certain details of\r\nsculpture to a mechanical process. This machine at first sight struck me\r\nas a queer kind of ancient armor. In brief, the subject is placed in\r\nposition, when the front part of this armor, set on some kind, of hinge,\r\nswings round before him, and the sculptor makes measurements by means of\r\nnumberless long metal needles, which are so arranged as to run in and\r\ntouch the subject: A stationary mark is placed where the needle touches,\r\nand then I think it is pulled back. So the artist goes on, until some\r\nhundreds of measurements are made, if necessary, when the process is\r\nfinished and the subject is released. How these measurements are made to\r\nserve the artist in modeling the statue I cannot very well describe, but\r\nI understood that by their aid Mr. Hart had modeled a bust from life in\r\nthe incredible space of two days! I further understood that Mr. Hart's\r\nportrait-busts are remarkable for their correct likeness, which of\r\ncourse they must be if they are mathematically correct in their\r\nproportions. Many of the artists in Florence have the bad taste to make\r\nsport of this machine; but if Mr. Hart's portrait-busts are what they\r\nhave the reputation of being, this sport is only a mask for jealousy.\r\nMr. Hart was extremely sensitive to the light manner Mr. Powers and\r\nothers have of speaking of this invention. One day he was much annoyed\r\nwhen a visitor, after examining the machine very attentively for some\r\ntime, exclaimed, \"Mr. Hart, what if you should have a man shut in there\r\namong those points, and he should happen to sneeze?\"\r\n\r\nThe Pitti Palace was one of my favorite haunts, and I often spent whole\r\nhours there in a single salon. There I almost always saw Mr. G----, a\r\nGerman-American, copying from the masters; and he could copy too! What\r\nan indefatigable worker he was! Slight and delicate of frame, he seemed\r\nabsolutely incapable of growing weary. He often toiled there all day\r\nlong, his hands red and swollen with the cold, for the winter, as I have\r\nbefore remarked, was unusually severe. For many days I saw him working\r\non a Descent from the Cross by Tintoretto--a bold attempt, for\r\nTintoretto's colors are as baffling as those of the great Venetian\r\nmaster himself. This copy had received very general praise, and one day\r\nI took a Lucca friend, a dilettante, to see it. Mr. G---- brought the\r\ncanvas out in the hall, that we might see it outside of the ocean of\r\ncolor which surrounded it in the gallery. When we reached the hall, Mr.\r\nG---- turned the picture full to the light. The effect was astounding.\r\nIt was so brilliant that you could hardly look at it. It seemed a mass\r\nof molten gold reflecting the sun. \"Good God!\" exclaimed G----, \"did I\r\ndo that?\" and an expression of bitter disappointment passed over his\r\nface. I ventured to suggest that as everybody had found it good while it\r\nwas in the gallery, this brilliant effect must be from the cold gray\r\nmarble of the hall. G---- could not pardon the picture, and nothing that\r\nthe Italian or I could say had the least effect. He would hear no excuse\r\nfor it, and, evidently quite mortified at the début of his Tintoretto,\r\nhe hurried the canvas back to the easel. The sister of the czar of\r\nRussia was greatly pleased with this copy, and proposed to buy it, but\r\nwhether she did or not I forgot to ascertain.\r\n\r\nAlone as I was in Florence, cultivating only the acquaintance of\r\nItalians, yet was I never troubled with _ennui_. I read much at\r\nVieussieux's, and when I grew tired of that and of music, I made long\r\nsables on the Lung Arno to the Cascine, through the charming Boboli\r\ngardens, or out to Fiesole. Fiesole is some two miles from Florence, and\r\nonce on my way there I stopped at the Protestant burying-ground and\r\npilfered a little wildflower from Theodore Parker's grave to send home\r\nto one of his romantic admirers. Fiesole must be a very ancient town,\r\nfor there is a ruined amphitheatre there, and the remains of walls so\r\nold that they are called Pelasgic in their origin; which is, I take it,\r\nsufficiently vague. The high hill is composed of the most solid marble;\r\nso the guidebooks say, at least. This is five hundred and seventy-five\r\nfeet above the sea, and on its summit stands the cathedral, very old\r\nindeed, and built in the form of a basilica, like that of San Miniato.\r\nFrom this hill you look down upon the plain beneath, with the Arno\r\nwinding through it, and upon Florence and the Apennine chain, above\r\nwhich rise the high mountains of Carrara. Here, on the highest available\r\npoint of the rock, I used to sit reading, and looking upon the panorama\r\nbeneath, until the sinking sun warned me that I had only time to reach\r\nthe city before its setting. I used to love to look also at works of art\r\nin this way, for by so doing I fixed them in my mind for future\r\nreference. I never passed the Piazza della Signoria without standing\r\nsome minutes before the Loggia dei Lanzi and the old ducal palace with\r\nits marvelous tower. Before this palace, exposed to the weather for\r\nthree hundred and fifty years, stands Michael Angelo's David; to the\r\nleft, the fountain on the spot where Savonarola was burnt alive by the\r\norder of Alexander VI.; and immediately facing this is the post-office.\r\nI never could pass the post-office without thinking of the poet Shelley,\r\nwho was there brutally felled to the earth by an Englishman, who accused\r\nhim of being an infidel, struck his blow and escaped.\r\n\r\nI made many visits to the Nuova Sacrista to see the tombs of the two\r\nMedici by Michael Angelo. The one at the right on entering is that of\r\nGiuliano, duke of Nemours, brother of Leo X. The two allegorical\r\nfigures reclining beneath are Morning and Night. The tomb of Lorenzo de'\r\nMedici, duke of Urfrino, stands on the other side of the chapel, facing\r\nthat of the duke de Nemours. The statue of Lorenzo, for grace of\r\nattitude and beauty of expression, has, in my opinion, never been\r\nequaled. The allegorical figures at the feet of this Medici are more\r\nbeautiful and more easily understood than most of Michael Angelo's\r\nallegorical figures. Nevertheless, I used sometimes, when looking at\r\nthese four figures, to think that they had been created merely as\r\narchitectural auxiliaries, and that their expression was an accident or\r\na freak of the artist's fancy, rather than the expression of some\r\nparticular thought: at other times I saw as much in them as most\r\nenthusiasts do--enough, I have no doubt, to astonish their great author\r\nhimself. I believe that very few people really experience rapturous\r\nsensations when they look at works of art. People are generally much\r\nmore moved by the sight of the two canes preserved in Casa Buonarotti,\r\nupon which the great master in his latter days supported his tottering\r\nframe, than they are by the noblest achievements of his genius.\r\n\r\nThe Carnival in Florence was a meagre affair compared with the same fête\r\nin Rome. During the afternoon, however, there was goodly procession of\r\nmasks in carriages on the Lung' Arno, and in the evening there was a\r\nfeeble _moccoletti_ display. The grand masked ball at the Casino about\r\nthis time presents an irresistible attraction to the floating population\r\nin Florence. I was foolish enough to go. All were obliged to be dressed\r\nin character or in full ball-costume: no dominoes allowed. The Casino, I\r\nwas told, is the largest club-house in the world; and salon after salon\r\nof that immense building was so crowded that locomotion was nearly\r\nimpossible. The floral decorations were magnificent, the music was\r\nexcellent, and some of the ten thousand people present tried to dance,\r\nbut the sets formed were soon squeezed into a ball. Then they gave up in\r\ndespair, while the men swore under their breath, and the women repaired\r\nto the dressing-rooms to sew on flounces or other skirt-trimmings. Masks\r\nwriggled about, and spoke to each other in the ridiculously squeaky\r\nvoice generally adopted on such occasions. Most of their conversation\r\nwas English, and of this very exciting order: \"You don't know me?\" \"Yes\r\nI do.\" \"No you don't.\" \"I know what you did yesterday,\" etc., etc., _ad\r\nnauseam._ How fine masked balls are in sensational novels! how\r\nabsolutely flat and unsatisfactory in fact! There was on this occasion a\r\nvast display of dress and jewelry, and among the babel of languages\r\nspoken the most prominent was the beautiful London dialect sometimes\r\nirreverently called Cockney. I lost my cavalier at one time, and while I\r\nwaited for him to find me I retired to a corner and challenged a mask to\r\na game of chess. He proved to be a Russian who spoke neither French nor\r\nItalian. We got along famously, however. He said something very polite\r\nin Russian, I responded irrelevantly in French, and then we looked at\r\neach other and grinned. He subsequently, thinking he had made an\r\nimpression, ventured to press my hand; I drew it away and told him he\r\nwas an idiot, at which he was greatly flattered; and then we grinned at\r\neach other again. It was very exciting indeed. I won the game easily,\r\nbecause he knew nothing of chess, and then he said something in his\r\nmother-tongue, placing his hand upon his heart. I could have sworn that\r\nit meant, \"Of course I would not be so rude as to win when playing with\r\na lady.\" I thought so, principally because he was a man, for I never\r\nknew a man under such circumstances who did not immediately betray his\r\nself-conceit by making that gallant declaration. Feeling sure that the\r\nRussian had done so, when we placed the pieces on the board again I\r\noffered him my queen. He seemed astounded and hurt; and then for the\r\nfirst time I thought that if this Russian were an exception to his sex,\r\nand I had _not_ understood his remark, then it was a rudeness to offer\r\nhim my queen. I was fortunately relieved from my perplexing situation\r\nby the approach of my cavalier, and as he led me away I gave my other\r\nhand to my antagonist in the most impressive manner, by way of atonement\r\nin case there _had_ been anything wrong in my conduct toward him.\r\n\r\nOne day during the latter part of my stay in Florence I went the second\r\ntime to the splendid studio of Mr. Powers. He talked very eloquently\r\nupon art. He said that some of the classic statues had become famous,\r\nand deservedly so, although they were sometimes false in proportion and\r\ndisposed in attitudes quite impossible in nature. He illustrated this by\r\na fine plaster cast of the Venus of Milo, before which we were standing.\r\nHe showed that the spinal cord in the neck could never, from the\r\nposition of the head, have joined that of the body, that there was a\r\nradical fault in the termination of the spinal column, and that the\r\nnavel was located falsely with respect to height. As he proceeded he\r\nconvinced me that he was correct; and in defence of this, my most\r\ncherished idol after the Apollo Belvedere, I only asked the iconoclast\r\nwhether these defects might not have been intentional, in order to make\r\nthe statue appear more natural when looked at in its elevated position\r\nfrom below. I subsequently repeated Mr. Powers's criticism of the Venus\r\nof Milo in the studio of another of our distinguished sculptors, and he\r\ntreated it with great levity, especially when I told him my authority.\r\nThere is a spirit of rivalry among sculptors which does not always\r\nmanifest itself in that courteous and well-bred manner which\r\ndistinguishes the medical faculty, for instance, in their dealings with\r\neach other. This courtesy is well illustrated by an anecdote I have\r\nrecently heard. A gentleman fell down in a fit, and a physician entering\r\nsaw a man kneeling over the patient and grasping him firmly by the\r\nthroat; whereupon the physician exclaimed, \"Why, sir, you are stopping\r\nthe circulation in the jugular vein!\" \"Sir,\" replied the other, \"I am a\r\ndoctor of medicine.\" To which the first M.D. remarked, \"Ah! I beg your\r\npardon,\" and stood by very composedly until the patient was comfortably\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Powers was conversing with me about the Venus of Milo, there\r\nentered two Englishwomen dressed very richly in brocades and velvets.\r\nThey seemed very anxious to see everything in the studio, talked in loud\r\ntones of the various objects of art, passed us, and occupied themselves\r\nfor some time before the statue called California. I heard one of them\r\nsay, \"I wonder if there's anybody 'ere that talks Hinglish?\" and in the\r\nsame breath she called out to Mr. Powers, \"Come 'ere!\" He was at work\r\nthat day, and wore his studio costume. I was somewhat surprised to see\r\nhim immediately obey the rude command, and the following conversation\r\noccurred:\r\n\r\n\"Do you speak Hinglish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this statue?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is called California, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has she got in 'er 'and?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thorns, madam, in the hand held behind the back; in the other she\r\npresents the quartz containing the tempting metal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n\r\nWe next entered a room where there was another work of the sculptor in\r\nprocess of formation. Mr. Powers and myself were engaged in an animated\r\nand, to me, very agreeable conversation, which was constantly\r\ninterrupted by these ill-bred women, who kept all the time mistaking the\r\nplaster for the marble, and asked the artist the most pestering\r\nquestions on the _modus operandi_ of sculpturing. I was astonished at\r\nthe marvelous temper of Mr. Powers, who politely and patiently answered\r\nall their queries. By some lucky chance these women got out of the way\r\nduring our slow progress back to the outer rooms, and I enjoyed Mr.\r\nPowers's conversation uninterruptedly. He showed me the beautiful baby\r\nhand in marble, a copy of his daughter's hand when an infant, and had\r\njust returned it to its shrine when the two women reappeared, and we all\r\nproceeded together. In the outer room there were several admirable\r\nbusts, upon which these women passed comment freely. One of these busts\r\nwas that of a lady, and they attacked it spitefully. \"What an ugly\r\nface!\" \"What a mean expression about the mouth!\" \"Isn't it 'orrible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" asked one of them, addressing Mr. Powers.\r\n\r\n\"That is a portrait of my wife,\" said the artist modestly.\r\n\r\n\"Your wife!\" repeated one of the women, and then, nothing abashed,\r\nadded, \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Powers, madam,\" he answered very politely. This discovery\r\nevidently disconcerted the impudence even of these visitors, and they\r\nimmediately left the studio.\r\n\r\nAs the day approached for my departure I visited all my old haunts, and\r\ndwelt fondly upon scenes which I might never see again. My dear old\r\nmusic-master cried when I bade him farewell. Povero maestro! He used to\r\nthink me so good that I was always ashamed of not being a veritable\r\nangel. I left Florence when\r\n\r\n        All the land in flowery squares,\r\n    Beneath a broad and equal-blowing wind,\r\n    Smelt of the coming summer.\r\n\r\nMy last visit was with the maestro to the Cascine, where he gathered me\r\na bunch of wild violets--cherished souvenir of a city I love, and of a\r\nfriend whose like I \"ne'er may look upon again.\"\r\n\r\nMARIE HOWLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN PLANTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Philadelphia hibernates in the ice and snow of February, the\r\nspring season opens in the Southern woods and pastures. The fragrant\r\nyellow jessamine clusters in golden bugles over shrubs and trees, and\r\nthe sward is enameled with the white, yellow and blue violet. The crocus\r\nand cowslip, low anemone and colts-foot begin to show, and the land\r\nbrightens with waxy flowers of the huckleberry, set in delicate gamboge\r\nedging. Yards, greeneries, conservatories breathe a June like fragrance,\r\nand aviaries are vocal with songsters, mocked outside by the American\r\nmocking-bird, who chants all night under the full moon, as if day was\r\ntoo short for his medley.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans burgeons with the season. The broad fair avenues, the wide\r\nboulevards, famed Canal street, are luxuriant with spring life and\r\ndrapery. Dashing equipages glance down the Shell Road with merry\r\ndriving-and picnic-parties. There is boating on the lake, and delicious\r\nFrench collations at pleasant resorts, spread by neat-handed mulatto\r\nwaiters speaking a patois of French, English and negro. There spring\r\nmeats and sauces and light French wines allure to enjoyments less\r\nsensual than the coarser Northern climate affords.\r\n\r\nThe unrivaled French opera is in season, the forcing house of that\r\nbright garden of exotics. Other and Northern cities boast of such\r\nentertainments, but I apprehend they resemble the Simon-Pure much as an\r\nEnglishman's French resembles the native tongue. In New Orleans it is\r\nthe natural, full-flavored article, lively with French taste and talent,\r\nand for a people instinct with a truer Gallic spirit, perhaps, than that\r\nof Paris itself. It is antique and colonial, but age and the sea-voyage\r\nhave preserved more distinctly the native _bouquet_ of the wine after\r\nall grosser flavors have wasted away. The spectacle within the theatre\r\non a fine night is brilliant, recherché and French. From side-scene to\r\ndome, and from gallery after gallery to the gay parquette, glitters the\r\nbright, shining audience. There are loungers, American and French, blasé\r\nand roué, who in the intervals drink brandy and whisky, or anisette,\r\nmaraschino, curçoa or some other fiery French cordial. The French\r\nloungers are gesticulatory, and shoulders, arms, fingers, eyes and\r\neyebrows help out the tongue's rapid utterance; but they are never rude\r\nor boisterous. There are belles, pretty French belles, with just a tint\r\nof deceitless rouge for fashion's sake, and tinkling, crisp, low French\r\nvoices modulated to chime with the music and not disharmonize it; nay,\r\nrather add to the sweetness of its concord.\r\n\r\nAnd there is the Creole dandy, the small master of the revels. There is\r\nnothing perfumed in the latest box of bonbons from Paris so exquisite,\r\nsparkling, racy, French and happy in its own sweet conceit as he is. He\r\nhas hands and feet a Kentucky girl might envy for their shapely delicacy\r\nand dainty size, cased in the neatest kid and prunella. His hair is\r\nnegligent in the elegantest grace of the perruquier's art, his dress\r\nfashioned to the very line of fastidious elegance and simplicity, yet a\r\nsimplicity his Creole taste makes unique and attractive. He has the true\r\nFrench persiflage, founded on happy content, not the blank indifference\r\nof the Englishman's disregard. It becomes graceful self-forgetfulness,\r\nand yet his vanity is French and victorious. In the atmosphere of\r\nbreathing music and faint perfume he looks around the glancing boxes,\r\nand knows he has but to throw his sultanic handkerchief to have the\r\nhandsomest Circassian in the glowing circle of female beauty. But he\r\ndoes not throw it, for all that. His manner plainly says: \"Beautiful\r\ndames, it would do me much of pleasure if I could elope with you all on\r\nthe road of iron, but the _bête noir_, the Moral, will not permit.\r\nBehold for which, as an opened box of Louvin's perfumeries, I dispense\r\nmy fragrant affection to you all: breathe it and be happy!\" Such homage\r\nhe receives with graceful acquiescence, believing his recognition of it\r\na sweet fruition to the fair adorers. He accepts it as he does the ices,\r\nwines and delicate French dishes familiar to his palate. Life is a\r\nfountain of eau sucrée, where everything is sweet to him, and he tries\r\nto make it so to you, for he is a kindly-natured, true-hearted, valiant\r\nlittle French gentleman. His loves, his innocent dissipations, his grand\r\npassions, his rapier duels, would fill the volumes of a Le Sage or a\r\nCervantes. In the gay circles of New Orleans he floats with lambent\r\nwings and irresistible fine eyes, its serenest butterfly, admired and\r\nspoiled alike by the French and American element.\r\n\r\nAt this early spring season a new atom of the latter enters the charmed\r\ncircle, breaking its merry round into other sparkles of foam. A\r\nwell-formed, stately, rather florid gentleman alights at the St.\r\nCharles, and is ushered into the hospitalities of that elegant\r\ncaravansary. There is something impressive about him, or there would be\r\nfarther North. He is American, from the strong, careless Anglo-Saxon\r\nface, through all the stalwart bones and full figure, to the strong,\r\nfirm, light step. He will crush through the lepidoptera of this\r\nhalf-French society like a silver knife through _Tourtereaux soufflés à\r\nla crême_. He brings letters to this and that citizen, or he is well\r\nknown already, and \"coloneled\" familiarly by stamp-expectant waiters and\r\nthe courteous master of ceremonies at the clerk's desk. He calls, on his\r\nbankers, and is received with gracious familiarity in the pleasant\r\nbank-parlor. Correspondence has made them acquainted with Colonel\r\nBeverage in the way of business: they are glad to see him in person, and\r\nwill be happy to wait on him. He makes them happy in that way, for they\r\ndo wait upon him satisfactorily. There is a little pleasant interchange\r\nof news and city gossip, and of something else. There is a crinkling of\r\na certain crispy, green foliage, and the colonel withdraws in the midst\r\nof civilities.\r\n\r\nHe next appears on Canal street, by and beyond the Clay Monument, with\r\noccasional pauses at clothiers', and buys his shirts at Moody's, as he\r\nhas probably often sworn not to do, because of its annoyingly frequent\r\nposters everywhere. He enters jewelers' shops and examines\r\ntrinkets--serpents with ruby eyes curled in gold on beds of golden\r\nleaves with emerald dews upon them; pearls, pear-shaped and tearlike,\r\nbrought up by swart, glittering divers, seven fathom deep, at Tuticorin\r\nor in the Persian Gulf; rubies and sapphires mined in Burmese Ava, and\r\ndiamonds from Borneo and Brazil. Is he choosing a bridal present? It\r\nlooks so; but no, he selects a splendid, brilliant solitaire, for which\r\nhe pays eight hundred dollars out of a plethoric purse, and also a\r\nfinger-ring, diamond too, for two hundred and fifty dollars. The\r\njewelers are polite, as the bankers were. He must be a large\r\ncotton-planter, one of a class with whom a fondness for jewels serves as\r\na means of dozing away life in a kind of crystallization. He otherwise\r\nadorns his stately person, till he has a Sublime Porte indeed, the very\r\nvizier of a fairy tale glittering in barbaric gems and gold. His taste,\r\nto speak it mildly, is expressed rather than subdued--not to be compared\r\nwith the quiet elegance of your husband or lover, madam or miss, but not\r\nunsuited to his showy style, for all that. As the crimson-purple,\r\nplume-like prince's feather has its own royal charm in Southern gardens\r\nbeside the pale and placidlily, so these luxuriant adornments, do not\r\nmisbecome his full and not too fleshy person. There is a certain harmony\r\nin the Oriental sumptuousness of his attire, like radiant sunsets,\r\nappropriate to certain styles of man and woman. Let us humble creatures\r\nbe content to have our portraits done in crayon, but the colonel calls\r\nfor the color-box.\r\n\r\nSo adorned and radiant, this variety of the American aloe floats into\r\nthe charmed circle of New Orleans society--that lively, sparkling\r\nepitome and relic of the old régime. He has good letters and a fair\r\nname, and mingles in the Mystick Krewe, that curious club, possible\r\nnowhere else, that has raised mummery into the sphere of aesthetics.\r\nPerhaps he has worn the gray, perhaps the blue. It is only in the very\r\narcana of exclusive passion it makes much difference. But gray or blue,\r\nor North or South in birth, he is in every essential a Southerner, as\r\nmany, like S.S. Prentiss, curiously independent of nativity, are. He is\r\nwell received and courteously entreated. He has his little suppers at\r\nMoreau's, and knows the ways of the place and names of the waiters. He\r\nhas his promenades, his drives, his club visits, is seen everywhere--a\r\nbrilliant convolvulus now, twining the espaliers of that Saracenic\r\nfabric of society; to speak architecturally, its very summer-house. He\r\nvisits the opera and gives it his frank approval, but confesses a\r\npreference for the old plantation-melodies. He crushes through the\r\nmeshes of the Creole dandies, not offensively, but as the law of his\r\nvolume and momentum dictates, and they yield the _pas_ to his superior\r\nweight and metal. They are civil, and he is civil, but they do not like\r\none another, for all that. That Zodiac passed, they continue their own\r\nsummery orbit of charm and conquest. He tends toward the aureal spheres\r\nand the green and pleasant banks of issue. The colonel is not here for\r\npleasure, though he takes a little pleasure, as is his way, seasonably;\r\nbut he means business, and that several thirsty, eager cotton-houses of\r\nrepute know.\r\n\r\nOf course they know. It came in his letters and distills in the aroma of\r\nhis talk. It may even have slipped into the personals of the _Pic_ and\r\n_Times_ that Colonel Beverage has taken Millefleur and Rottenbottom\r\nplantations on Red River, and is going extensively into the cultivation\r\nof the staple. The colonel is modest over this: \"not extensively, no,\r\nbut to the extent of his limited means.\" In the mean while he looks out\r\nfor some sound, well-recommended cotton-house.\r\n\r\nThis means business. In the North the farmer raises his crop on his own\r\ncapital, and turns it over unencumbered to the merchant for the public.\r\nThe credit system prevails in the agriculture of the South, and brings\r\nanother precarious element into the already hazardous occupation of\r\ncotton-growing. A new party appears in the cotton-merchant. He is not\r\nmerely the broker, yielding the proceeds, less a commission, to the\r\nplanter. Either, by hypothecation on advances made during the year, he\r\nsecures a legal pre-emption in the crop, or, by initiatory contract, he\r\nbecomes an actual partner of limited liability in the crop itself. He\r\nagrees to furnish so much cash capital at periods for the cultivation\r\nand securing of the crop, which is husbanded by the planter. The money\r\nfor these advances he obtains from the banks; and hence it is that in\r\nevery cotton-crop raised South there are three or more principals\r\nactually interested--the banker, the merchant and the planter. This\r\ncondition of planting is almost invariable. Even the small farmer, whose\r\ncrop is a few bags, is ground into it. In his case the country-side\r\ngrocer and dealer is banker and merchant, and his advances the bare\r\nnecessaries. In this blending of interests the curious partnership\r\nrises, thrives, labors and sometimes falls--the planter, as a rule,\r\nundermost in that accident.\r\n\r\nThe Millefleur and Rottenbottom plantations are famous, and a hand well\r\nover the crops raised under such shrewd, experienced management as that\r\nof Colonel Beverage is a stroke of policy. Therefore, as the bankers and\r\njewelers have been polite, so now the cotton-merchants are civil; but\r\nthe colonel is shy--an old bird and a game bird.\r\n\r\nShy, but not suspicious. He chooses his own time, and at an early day\r\nwalks into the business-house of Negocier & Duthem. They are pleased to\r\nsee the colonel in the way of business, as they have been in society,\r\nand the pleasure is mutual. As he expounds his plans they are more and\r\nmore convinced that he is a plumy bird of much waste feather.\r\n\r\nHe has taken Rottenbottom and Millefleur, and is going pretty well\r\ninto cotton. He thinks he understands it: he ought to. Then he\r\nhas his own capital--an advantage, certainly. Some of his friends,\r\nSo-and-so--running over commercial and bankable names easily--have\r\nsuggested the usual co-operation with some reputable house, and an\r\nextension, but he believes He will stay within limits. He has five\r\nthousand dollars in cash he wishes to deposit with some good firm for\r\nthe year's supplies. He believes that will be sufficient, and he has\r\ncalled to hear their terms. All this comes not at once, but here and\r\nthere in the business-conversation.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perceive one strong bait carelessly thrown out by the\r\nauriferous or folliferous colonel--the five thousand dollars cash in\r\nhand. The immediate use of that is a strong incentive to the house. They\r\ncovet the colonel's business: they think well of the proposed extension.\r\nCotton is sure to be up, and under practical, experienced cultivation\r\nmust yield a handsome fortune. The result is foreseen. The cotton-house\r\nand the colonel enter into the usual agreement of such transactions. The\r\ncolonel leaves his five thousand dollars, and draws on that, and for as\r\nmuch more as may be necessary in securing the crop.\r\n\r\nThe commercial reader North who has had no dealings South will smile at\r\nthe credulous merchant who entrusts his credit to such a full-blown,\r\nthirsty tropical pitcher-plant as the colonel, who carries childish\r\nextravagances in his very dress; but he will judge hastily. We have seen\r\nthis gaudy efflorescence pass over the curiously-wrought enameled\r\ngold-work, opals, pearls and rubies, and adorn himself with solid\r\ndiamonds. The careful economist North puts his superfluous thousands in\r\ngovernment bonds, or gambles them away in Erie stocks, because he likes\r\nthe increase of Jacob's speckled sheep. The Southerner invests his in\r\ndiamonds because he likes show, and diamonds have a pretty steady market\r\nvalue. There is method, too, in the colonel's associations, and all his\r\nacquaintance is gilt-edged and bankable.\r\n\r\nHis business is now done, and he does not tarry, but wings his way to\r\nMillefleur and Rottenbottom, where he moults all his fine feathers. He\r\ngoes into fertilizers, beginning with crushed cotton-seed and barnyard\r\nmanure, if possible, before February is over. He follows the\r\nshovel-plough with a slick-jack, and plants, and then the labor begins\r\nto fail him. He talks about importing Chinese, and writes about it in\r\nthe local paper. He is sure it will do, as he is positive in all his\r\nopinions. He is true pluck, and tries to make new machinery make up for\r\ndeficient labor. He buys \"bull-tongues,\" \"cotton-shovels,\" \"fifteen-inch\r\nsweeps,\" \"twenty-inch sweeps,\" \"team-ploughs with seven-inch twisters,\"\r\nand a \"finishing sweep of twenty-six inches.\" He hears of other\r\ninventions, and orders them. The South is flooded with a thousand quack\r\ncontrivances now, about as applicable to cotton-raising as a pair of\r\nnut-crackers; but the colonel buys them. He is going to dispense with\r\nthe hoe. That is the plan; and by that plan of furnishing a large\r\nplantation with new tools before Lent is over the five thousand dollars\r\nare gone. But he writes cheerfully. It is his nature to be sanguine, and\r\nto hope loudly, vaingloriously; and he writes it honestly enough to his\r\nmerchant--and draws. The labor gets worse and worse. In the indolent\r\nsummer days the negro, careless, thriftless, ignorant, works only at\r\nintervals. Perhaps the June rise catches him, and there is a heavy\r\nexpense in ditching and damming to save the Rottenbottom crop. Maybe the\r\nmerchant hears of the army-worm and is alarmed, but the colonel writes\r\nback assuring letters that it is only the grasshopper, and the\r\ngrasshopper has helped more than hurt--and draws. Then possibly the\r\narmy-worm comes sure enough, and cripples him. But he keeps up his\r\ncourage--and draws. The five thousand dollars appear to have been\r\nemployed in digging or building a sluice through which a constant\r\ncurrent of currency flows from the city to Rottenbottom and Millefleur.\r\nThe merchant has gone into bank, and the tide flows on. At last the\r\nplanter writes: \"The most magnificent crop ever raised on Red River,\r\njust waiting for the necessary hands to gather it in!\" Of course the\r\nnecessary sums are supplied, and at last the crop gets to market. It\r\nfinds the market low, and declining steadily week by week. The banks\r\nbegin to press: money is tight, as it is now while I write. The crop is\r\nsacrificed, for the merchant cannot wait, and some fine morning the\r\nhouse of Negocier & Duthem is closed, and Colonel Beverage is bankrupt.\r\n\r\nAnd both are ruined? No. We will suppose the business-house is old and\r\nreputable: the banks are obliging and creditors prudently liberal, and\r\nby and by the firm resumes its old career. As for the colonel, the\r\nreader sees that to ruin him would be an absolute contradiction of\r\nnature. His friends or relations give him assistance, or he sells his\r\ndiamonds, and soon you meet him at the St. Charles, as blooming,\r\nsanguine and splendiferous as ever. No, he cannot be ruined, but his is\r\nnot an infrequent episode in the life of a Southern Planter.\r\n\r\nWILL WALLACE HARNEY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBABES IN THE WOOD.\r\n\r\n    I had two little babes, a boy and girl--\r\n      Two little babes that are not with me now:\r\n    On one bright brow full golden fell the curl--\r\n      The curl fell chestnut-brown on one bright brow.\r\n\r\n    I like to dream of them that some soft day,\r\n      Whilst wandering from home, their fitful feet\r\n    Went heedlessly through some still woodland way\r\n      Where light and shade harmoniously meet;\r\n\r\n    And that they wandered deeper and more deep\r\n      Into the forest's fragrant heart and fair,\r\n    Till just at evenfall they dropped asleep,\r\n      And ever since they have been resting there.\r\n\r\n    After their willful wandering that day\r\n      Each is so tired it does not wake at all,\r\n    Whilst over them the boughs that sigh and sway\r\n      Conspire to make perpetual evenfall.\r\n\r\n    And I, that must not join them, still am blest,\r\n      Passionately, though this poor heart grieves;\r\n    For memories, like birds, at my behest,\r\n      Have covered them with tender thoughts, like leaves.\r\n\r\nEDGAR FAWCETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY CHARGE ON THE LIFE-GUARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that our little international troubles about consequential damages\r\nand the like are happily settled, and there is no danger that my\r\nrevelations will augment them in any degree, I think I may venture to\r\ngive the particulars of an affair of honor which I once had with a\r\ngigantic member of Her Britannic Majesty's household troops.\r\n\r\nMy guardian had a special veneration for England in general and for\r\nOxford in particular, and I was brought up and sent to Yale with the\r\nfull understanding that St. Bridget's, Oxon., was the place where I was\r\nto be \"finished.\" I left Yale at the end of Junior year and crossed the\r\nocean in the crack steamer of the then famous Collins line. I do not\r\nbelieve any young American ever had a more favorable introduction to\r\nEngland than I had, and the wonder is that, considering the\r\nphilo-Anglican atmosphere in which I was educated, I did not become a\r\nthorough-paced renegade. I was, however, blessed with a tolerably\r\nindependent spirit, and kept my nationality intact throughout my\r\nuniversity course.\r\n\r\nLike Tom Brown, I felt myself drawn to the sporting set, and, as I was\r\nalways an adept at athletics, soon won repute as an oarsman, and was\r\nwell satisfied to be looked upon as the Yankee champion sundry amateur\r\nrowing-and boxing-matches, as well as in the lecture-room. Of course, I\r\nwas the mark for no end of good-natured chaff about my nationality, but\r\nwas nearly always able, I believe, to sustain the honor of the American\r\nname, and so at length graduated in the \"firsts\" as to scholarship, and\r\nenjoyed the distinguished honor of pulling number four in the \"'Varsity\r\neight\" in our annual match with Cambridge on the Thames. Moreover, I\r\nstood six feet in my stockings, had the muscle of a gladiator, and was\r\nphysically the equal of any man at Oxford.\r\n\r\nAfter the race was over my special cronies hung about London for a few\r\ndays, usually making that classical \"cave\" of Evans's a rendezvous in\r\nthe evening. Two or three young officers of the Guards were often with\r\nus, and one night, when the talk had turned, as it often did, on\r\npersonal prowess, the superb average physique of their regiment was duly\r\nlauded by our soldier companions. At length one of them remarked, in\r\nthat aggravatingly superior tone which some Englishmen assume, that any\r\nman in his troop could handle any two of the then present company. This\r\nprovoked a general laugh of incredulity, and two or three of our college\r\nset turned to me with--\"What do you say to that, Jonathan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said I. \"I'll put on the gloves with the biggest fellow\r\namong them, any day.\"\r\n\r\nThis somewhat democratic readiness to spar with a private soldier led to\r\nremarks which I chose to consider insular, if not insolent, and I\r\nreplied, supporting the principle of Yankee equality, until, losing my\r\ntemper at something which one of the ensigns said, I delivered myself in\r\nsome such fashion as this: \"Well, gentlemen, I'm only one Yankee among\r\nmany Englishmen, but I will bet a hundred guineas, and put up the money,\r\nthat I will tumble one of those mighty warriors out of his saddle in\r\nfront of the Horse Guards, and ride off on his horse before the guard\r\ncan turn out and stop me.\"\r\n\r\nOf course my bet was instantly taken by the officers, but my friends\r\nwere so astounded at my rashness that I found no backers. However, my\r\nblood was up, and, possibly because Evans's bitter beer was buzzing\r\nslightly in my head, I booked several more bets at large odds in my own\r\nfavor. As the hour was late, we separated with an agreement to meet and\r\narrange details on the following day, keeping the whole affair strictly\r\nsecret meanwhile.\r\n\r\nI confess that my feelings were not of the pleasantest as I sat at my\r\nlate London breakfast somewhere about noon the next day, and I was fain\r\nto admit to my special friend that I had put myself in an awkward, if\r\nnot an unenviable, position. However, I was in for it, and being\r\nnaturally of an elastic temperament, began to cast about for a cheerful\r\nview of my undertaking. In the course of the day preliminaries were\r\narranged and reduced to writing with all the care which Englishmen\r\npractice in such affairs of \"honor.\" I only stipulated that I should be\r\nallowed to use a stout walking-stick in my encounter; that I should be\r\nkept informed as to the detail for guard; that I should be freely\r\nallowed to see the regiment at drill and in quarters; and that I should\r\nselect my time of attack within a fortnight, giving a few hours' notice\r\nto all parties concerned, so as to ensure their presence as witnesses.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has ever visited London has seen and admired the gigantic\r\nhorsemen who sit on mighty black steeds, one on either side of the\r\narchway facing Whitehall, and who are presumed at once to guard the\r\ncommander-in-chief's head-quarters and to serve as \"specimen bricks\" of\r\nthe finest cavalry corps in the world. Splendid fellows they are! None\r\nof them are under six feet high, and many of them are considerably above\r\nthat mark. They wear polished steel corselets and helmets, white\r\nbuck-skin trowsers, high jack-boots, and at the time of which I write\r\ntheir arms consisted of a brace of heavy, single-barreled pistols in\r\nholsters, a carbine and a sabre. The firearms were, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, not loaded, and the sabre was held at a \"carry\" in the\r\nright hand. This last was the weapon against which I must guard, and I\r\naccordingly placed a traveling cap and a coat in the hands of a discreet\r\ntailor, who sewed steel bands into the crown of one and into the\r\nshoulders of the other, in such a way as afforded very efficient\r\nprotection against a possible downward cut.\r\n\r\nBesides attending to these defensive preparations, I at once looked\r\nabout for a competent horseman with military experience who could give\r\nme some practical hints as to encounters between infantry and cavalry,\r\nand, singularly enough, was thrown in with that gallant young officer\r\nwho rode into immortality in front of the Light Brigade at Balaklava a\r\nfew years afterward. I learned that he was a superb horseman, was down\r\nupon the English system of cavalry training, and was using pen and\r\ntongue to bring about a change. A sudden inspiration led me to take him\r\ninto my confidence, as the terms of our agreement permitted me to do. He\r\ncaught the idea with enthusiasm. What an argument it would be in favor\r\nof his new system if a mere civilian unhorsed a Guardsman trained after\r\nthe old fashion! For a week he drilled me more or less every day in\r\ngetting him off his horse in various ways, and I speedily became a\r\nproficient in the art, he meanwhile gaining some new ideas on the\r\nsubject, which were duly printed in his well-known book.\r\n\r\nWell, to make my story short, I gave notice to interested parties on the\r\ntenth day, put on my steel-ribbed cap and my armor-plated coat, and with\r\nstick in hand walked over to a hairdresser's with whom I had previously\r\ncommunicated, had my complexion darkened to a Spanish olive, put on a\r\nfalse beard, and was ready for service. I had arranged with this\r\ntonsorial artist, whose shop was in the Strand near Northumberland\r\nHouse, that he should be prepared to remove these traces of disguise as\r\nspeedily as he had put them on, and that I should leave a stylish coat\r\nand hat in his charge, to be donned in haste should occasion require. I\r\nnext engaged two boys to stand opposite Northumberland House, and be\r\nready to hold a horse. These boys I partially paid beforehand, and\r\npromised more liberal largess if they did their duty. Preliminaries\r\nhaving been thus arranged, I strolled down Whitehall, feeling very much\r\nas I did years afterward when I found myself going into action for the\r\nfirst time in Dixie.\r\n\r\nIt was early afternoon on a lovely spring day. The Strand was a roaring\r\nstream of omnibuses and drays, carriages were beginning to roll along\r\nthe drives leading to Rotten Row, and all London was in the streets. I\r\nwas assured that at this hour I should find a big but father clumsy\r\ngiant on post; and there he was, sure enough, sitting like a colossal\r\nstatue on his coal-black charger, the crest of his helmet almost\r\ntouching the keystone of the arch under which he sat, his accoutrements\r\nshining like jewels, and he looking every inch a British cavalryman. I\r\nwalked past on the opposite side of Whitehall, meeting, without being\r\nrecognized, all my aiders and abettors in this most heinous attack on\r\nHer Majesty's Guards. I then crossed the street and took a good look at\r\nmy man. He and his companion-sentry under the other arch were aware of\r\nofficers in \"mufti\" on the opposite sidewalk, and kept their eyes\r\nimmovably to the front. Evidently nothing much short of an earthquake\r\ncould cause either to relax a muscle. The little circle of admiring\r\nbeholders which is always on hand inspecting these splendid horsemen was\r\npresent, of course, with varying elements, and I had to wait a few\r\nminutes until a small number of innocuous spectators coincided with the\r\naphelion of the periodical policeman.\r\n\r\nIt was not a pleasant thing to contemplate that tower of polished\r\nleather, brass and steel, with a man inside of it some forty pounds\r\nheavier than I, and think that in a minute or so we two should be\r\nengaged in a close grapple, whose termination involved considerable risk\r\nfor me physically as well as pecuniarily. However, there was, in\r\naddition to the feeling of apprehension, a touch of elation at the\r\nthought that I, a lone Yankee, was about to beard the British lion in\r\nhis most formidable shape, almost under the walls of Buckingham Palace.\r\n\r\nI looked my antagonist carefully over, deciding several minor points in\r\nmy mind, and then at a favorable moment stepped quietly within striking\r\ndistance, and delivered a sharp blow with my stick on his left instep,\r\nas far forward as I could without hitting the stirrup. The man seemed to\r\nbe in a sort of military trance, for he never winced. Quick as thought,\r\nI repeated the blow, and this time the fellow fairly yelled with rage,\r\nastonishment and pain. I have since made up my mind that his nerve-fibre\r\nmust have been of that inert sort which transmits waves of sensation but\r\nslowly, so that the perception of the first blow reached the interior of\r\nhis helmet just about as the second descended. At all events, he jerked\r\nback his foot, and somehow, between the involuntary contraction of his\r\nflexor muscles from pain and the glancing of my stick, his foot slipped\r\nfrom the stirrup. This, as I had learned from my instructor, was a great\r\npoint gained, and in an instant I had him by the ankle and by the top of\r\nhis jack-boot, doubling his leg, at the same time heaving mightily\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nAs I gave my whole strength to the effort I was dimly aware of screams\r\nand panic among the nursery--maids and children who were but a moment\r\nbefore my fellow-spectators. At the same time I caught the flash of the\r\nGuardsman's sabre as he cut down at me after the fashion prescribed in\r\nthe broadsword exercise. Fortune, however, did not desert me. My\r\nantagonist had not enough elbow-room, and his sword-point was shivered\r\nagainst the stone arch overhead, the blade descending flatways and\r\nharmlessly upon my well-protected shoulder just as, with a final effort,\r\nI tumbled him out his saddle.\r\n\r\nThe recollection of the ludicrous figure which that Guardsman cut haunts\r\nme still. His pipeclayed gloves clutched wildly at holster and cantle as\r\nhe went over. Down came the gleaming helmet crashing upon the pavement,\r\nand with a calamitous rattle and bang the whole complicated structure of\r\ncorselet, scabbard, carbine, cross-belts, spurs and boots went into the\r\ninside corner of the archway, a helpless heap.\r\n\r\nThat started the horse. The noble animal had stood my assault as\r\nsteadily as if he had been cast in bronze, but precisely such an\r\nemergency as this had never been contemplated in his training, as it had\r\nnot in that of his master, and he now started forward rather wildly. I\r\nhad my hand on the bridle before he had moved a foot, and swung myself\r\nhalf over his back as he dashed across the sidewalk and up Whitehall.\r\nThe Guards' saddles are very easy when once you are in them, and I had\r\nreason, temporarily at least, to approve the English style of riding\r\nwith short stirrups, for I readily found my seat, and ascertained that I\r\ncould touch bottom with my toes. As I left the scene of my victory\r\nbehind me I heard the guards turning out, and caught a glimpse as of all\r\nLondon running in my direction, but by the time that I had secured the\r\ncontrol of my horse I had distanced the crowd, and as we entered the\r\nStrand we attracted comparatively little notice. In driving, the English\r\nturn out to the left instead of to the right, as is the custom here, and\r\nI was obliged to cross the westward-bound line of vehicles before I\r\ncould fall in with that which would bring me to my boys. I decided to\r\nmake a \"carom\" of it, and nearly took the heads off a pair of horses,\r\nand the pole off the omnibus to which they were attached, as I dashed\r\nthrough. Turning to the right, I soon lost the torrent of invective\r\nhurled after me by the driver and conductor of the discomfited 'bus, and\r\nin less than two minutes--which seemed to me an age, for the pursuit was\r\ndrawing near--I reached my boys, dropped them a half sov. apiece, which\r\nI had ready in my hand, and bolted for my hairdresser's, the boys\r\nleading the horse in the opposite direction, as previously ordered.\r\n\r\nIt was none too soon, for as I ran up stairs I saw three or four\r\npolicemen running toward the horse, and there was a gleam of dancing\r\nplumes and shining helmets toward Whitehall. My false beard and\r\ncomplexion were changed with marvelous rapidity, and, assuming my\r\npromenade costume, I sauntered down stairs and out upon the sidewalk in\r\ntime to see the whole street jammed with a crowd of excited Britons,\r\nwhile the recaptured horse was turned over to the Guardsmen, and the two\r\nboys were marched off to Bow street for examination before a magistrate.\r\n\r\nA private room and an elaborate dinner at the United Service Club\r\nclosed the day; and I must admit that my military friends swallowed\r\ntheir evident chagrin with a very good grace. Of course I was told that\r\nI could not do it again, which I readily admitted; and that there was\r\nnot another man in the troop whom I could have unhorsed--an assertion\r\nwhich I as persistently combated. The affair was officially hushed up,\r\nand probably not more than a few thousand people ever heard of it\r\noutside military circles.\r\n\r\nHow I escaped arrest and punishment to the extent of the law I did not\r\nknow for many years, for the duke of Wellington, who was then\r\ncommander-in-chief, had only to order the officers concerned under\r\narrest, and I should have been in honor bound to come forward with a\r\nvoluntary confession.\r\n\r\nMy giant was sent for to the old duke's private room the day after his\r\noverthrow, and questioned sharply by the adjutant, who, with pardonable\r\nincredulity, suspected that bribery alone could have brought about so\r\ndireful a catastrophe. The duke was from the first convinced of the\r\nsoldier's, honesty and bravery, and presently broke in upon the\r\nadjutant's examination with--\"Well, well! speak to me now. What have you\r\nto say for yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"May it please yer ludship,\" said the undismayed soldier, \"I've never\r\nfought a civilian sence I 'listed, an' yer ludship will bear me witness\r\nthat there's nothing in the cavalry drill about resisting a charge of\r\nfoot when a mon's on post at the Horse Guards.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was delivered with the most perfect sincerity and sobriety,\r\nand although it reflected upon the efficiency of the army under the hero\r\nof Waterloo, the Iron Duke was so much impressed by the affair that he\r\nsent word to Lieutenant-Colonel Varian, commanding the regiment, not to\r\norder the man any punishment whatever, but to see that his command was\r\nthereafter trained in view of possible attacks, even when posted in\r\nfront of army head-quarters.\r\n\r\nCHARLES L. NORTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING AND A PAINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles V. once said, \"Titian should be served by Caesar;\" and Michael\r\nAngelo, we read, was treated by Lorenzo de' Medici \"as a son;\" Raphael,\r\nhis contemporary, was great enough to revere him, and thank God he had\r\nlived at the same time. In England, in France, in Germany, in Italy, in\r\nSpain at this day, the poet and the painter stand hedged about by the\r\ndivinity of their gifts, and the people are proud to recognize their\r\nkingship.\r\n\r\nHas \"Reverence, that angel of the world,\" as Shakespeare beautifully\r\nsays, forgot to visit America? Or must we consider ourselves less\r\ncapable yet of delicate appreciation, such as older nations possess? Or\r\nare we over-occupied in gaining possession of material comforts and\r\nluxuries, and so forget to revere our poets and painters till it is too\r\nlate, and the curtain has fallen upon their unobtrusive and often\r\nstruggling earthly career? What a millennium will have arrived when we\r\nlearn to be as _faithful_ to our love as we are sincere!\r\n\r\nQuestions like these have been asked also in times preceding ours.\r\nAlfred de Musset wrote upon this subject in 1833, in Paris: \"There are\r\npeople who tell you our age is preoccupied, that men no longer read\r\nanything or care for anything. Napoleon was occupied, I think, at\r\nBeresina: he, however, had his _Ossian_ with him. When did Thought lose\r\nthe power of being able to leap into the saddle behind Action? When did\r\nman forget to rush like Tyrtaeus to the combat, a sword in one hand, the\r\nlyre in the other? Since the world still has a body, it has a soul.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Charles Blanc writes: \"In order to have an idea of the\r\nimportance of the arts, it is enough to fancy what the great nations of\r\nthe world would be if the monuments they have erected to their faiths,\r\nand the works whereon they have left the mark of their genius, were\r\nsuppressed from history. It is with people as with men--after death only\r\nthe emanations of their mind remain; that is to say, literature and art,\r\nwritten poems, and poems inscribed on stone, in marble or in color.\"\r\n\r\nThe same writer, in his admirable book, _Grammaire des arts du dessin,_\r\nfrom which we are tempted to quote again and again, says: \"The artist\r\nwho limits himself simply to the imitation of Nature reaches only\r\n_individuality_: he is a slave. He who interprets Nature sees in her\r\nhappy qualities; he evolves _character_ from her; he is master. The\r\nartist who idealizes her discovers in her or imprints upon her the image\r\nof _beauty_: this last is a great master.... Placed between Nature and\r\nthe ideal, between what is and what must be, the artist has a vast\r\ncareer before him in order to pass from the reality he sees to the\r\nbeauty he divines. If we follow him in this career, we see his model\r\ntransform itself successively before his eyes.... But the artist must\r\ngive to these creations of his soul the imprint of life, and he can only\r\nfind this imprint in the individuals Nature has created. The two are\r\ninseparable--the type, which is a product of thought, and the\r\nindividual, which is a child of life.\"\r\n\r\nWith this excellent analysis before us, we will recall one by one some\r\nof the best-known and most interesting works of W.M. Hunt, a painter who\r\nnow holds a prominent place among the artists of America. We will try to\r\ndiscover by careful observation if the high gifts of Verity and\r\nImagination, the sign and seal of the true artist, really belong to him:\r\nif so, where these qualities are expressed, and what value we should set\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nFirst, perhaps, for those readers remote from New England who may never\r\nhave seen any pictures by this artist, a few words should be said by way\r\nof describing some characteristics of his work and the limitations of\r\nit; which limitations are rather loudly dwelt upon by connoisseurs and\r\nlovers of the popular modern French school. Artists discern these\r\nlimitations of course more keenly even than others, but their tribute to\r\nverity and ideal beauty as represented by this painter is too sincere to\r\nallow caviling to find expression. This limitation to which we refer\r\ncauses Mr. Hunt to allow _ideal suggestions_, rather than pictures, to\r\npass from his studio, and makes him cowardly before his own work. It\r\nrecalls in a contrary sense that saying of the sculptor Puget: \"The\r\nmarble trembles before me.\" Mr. Hunt trembles before his new-born idea.\r\nHis swift nature has allowed him in the first hour of work to put into\r\nhis picture the tenderness or rapture, the unconscious grace or\r\ntempestuous force, which he despaired at first of ever being able to\r\nexpress. In the flush of success he stops: he has it, the idea; the\r\nchief interest of the subject is portrayed before him; the delicate\r\npresence (and what can be more delicate than the thoughts he has\r\ndelineated?) is there, and may vanish if touched in a less fortunate\r\nmoment. But is this lack of fulfillment in the artist entirely without\r\nprecedent or parallel? Had not Sir Joshua Reynolds a studio full of\r\nyoung artists who \"finished off\" his pictures? Were not the very faces\r\nthemselves painted with such rapidity and want of proper method as to\r\ndrop off, on occasion, entirely from the canvas, as in case of the boy's\r\nhead, in being carried through the street? Hunt is of our own age, and\r\nwould scorn the suggestion of having a hand or a foot painted for him,\r\nas if it were a matter of small importance what individual expression a\r\nhand or a foot should wear; but who can tell for what future age he has\r\npainted the wise, abrupt, kind, persistent, simple, strong old Judge in\r\nhis Yankee coat; or the genial, resolute, hopeful, self-sacrificing\r\ngovernor of Massachusetts; and the Master of the boys, with his keen,\r\nloving, uncompromising face? These are pictures that, when children say,\r\n\"Tell us about the Governor who helped Massachusetts bring her men first\r\ninto the field during our war,\" we may lead them up before and reply,\r\n\"He was this man!\" So also with the portraits of the Judge, of the\r\nMaster of the boys, of the old man with clear eyes and firm mouth, and\r\nthat sweet American girl standing, unconscious of observation, plucking\r\nat the daisy in her hat and guessing at her fate.\r\n\r\nHurry, impatience and a worship of crude thought are characteristics of\r\nour present American life. Hunt is one of us. If these faults mark and\r\nmar his work, they show him also to be a child of the time. His quick\r\nsympathies are caught by the wayside and somewhat frayed out among his\r\nfellows; but nevertheless one essential of a great painter, that of\r\n_Verity_, will be accorded to him after an examination of the pictures\r\nwe have mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut truth, character, skill, the many gifts and great labor which must\r\nunite to lead an artist to the foot of his shadowy, sun-crowned\r\nmountain, can then carry him no step farther unless ideal Beauty join\r\nhim, and he comprehend her nature and follow to her height. Again we\r\nquote from Charles Blanc--for why should we rewrite what he says so\r\nably?--\"All the germs of beauty are in Nature, but it belongs to the\r\nspirit of man alone to disengage them. When Nature is beautiful, the\r\npainter _knows_ that she is beautiful, but Nature knows nothing of it.\r\nThus beauty exists only on the condition of being understood--that is to\r\nsay, of receiving a second life in the human thought. Art has something\r\nelse to do than to copy Nature exactly: it must penetrate into the\r\nspirit of things, it must evoke the soul of its hero. It can then not\r\nonly rival Nature, but surpass her. What is indeed the superiority of\r\nNature? It is the life which animates all her forms. But man possesses a\r\ntreasure which Nature does not possess--thought. Now thought is more\r\nthan life, for it is life at its highest power, life in its glory. Man\r\ncan then contest with Nature by manifesting thought in the forms of art,\r\nas Nature manifests life in her forms. In this sense the philosopher\r\nHegel was able to say that the creations of art were truer than the\r\nphenomena of the physical world and the realities of history.\"\r\n\r\nNow, thought in the soul of the true artist for ever labors to evolve\r\nthe beautiful. This is what the thought of a picture means to him--how\r\nto express beauty, which he finds underlying even the imperfect\r\nindividual of Nature's decaying birth. To the high insight this is\r\nalways discernible. None are so fallen that some ray of God's light may\r\nnot touch them, and this possibility, the faith in light for ever,\r\nradiates from the spirit of the artist, and renders him a messenger of\r\njoy. No immortal works have bloomed in despondency: they may have taken\r\nroot in the slime of the earth, but they have blossomed into lilies.\r\n\r\nWe call this divine power to discern beauty in every manifestation of\r\nthe Deity, imagination. As it expresses itself in painting, it is so\r\nclosely allied with what is highest and holiest in our natures that\r\npainting has come to be esteemed a Christian art, as contrasted in its\r\ndevelopment subsequent to the Christian era with the less human works of\r\nsculpture. \"Christianity came, and instead of physical beauty\r\nsubstituted moral beauty, infinitely preferring the expression of the\r\nsoul to the perfection of the body. Every man was great in its eyes, not\r\nby his perishable members, but by his immortal soul. With this religion\r\nbegins the reign of painting, which is a more subtle art, more\r\nimmaterial, than the others--more expressive, and also more individual.\r\nWe will give some proofs of it. Instead of acting, like architecture and\r\nsculpture, upon the three dimensions of heavy matter, painting acts only\r\nupon one surface, and produces its effects with an imponderable thing,\r\nwhich is color--that is to say, light. Hegel has said with admirable\r\nwisdom: 'In sculpture and architecture forms are rendered visible by\r\nexterior light. In painting, on the contrary, matter, obscure in itself,\r\nhas within itself its internal element, its ideal--light: it draws from\r\nitself both clearness and obscurity. Now, unity, the combination of\r\nlight and dark, is color.' The painter, then, proposes to himself to\r\nrepresent, not bodies with their real thickness, but simply their\r\nappearance, their image; but by this means it is the mind which he\r\naddresses. Visible but impalpable, and in some sense immaterial, his\r\nwork does not meet the touch, which is the sight of the body: it only\r\nmeets the eye, which is the touch of the soul. Painting is then, from\r\nthis point of view, the essential art of Christianity.... If the\r\npainter, like Phidias or Lysippus, had only to portray the types of\r\nhumanity, the majesty of Jupiter, the strength of Hercules, he might do\r\nwithout the riches of color, and paint in one tone, modified only by\r\nlight and shade; but the most heroic man among Christians is not a\r\ndemigod: he is a being profoundly individual, tormented, combating,\r\nsuffering, and who throughout his real life shares with environing\r\nNature, and receives from every side the reflection of her colors.\r\nSculpture, generalizing, raises itself to the dignity of\r\nallegory--painting, individualizing, descends to the familiarity of\r\nportraiture.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now return to consider William Hunt's pictures from this second\r\npoint of view. The gift of Verity having been already assumed, can we\r\nalso discern that higher power of Imagination whose crown and seal is\r\nthe Beautiful. To decide this question we have, unhappily, to consider\r\nhis work as lyrical, rather than dramatic, and for this reason we must\r\nstudy his power under disadvantage. That he possesses dramatic power\r\nwill hardly be denied by those who know his \"Hamlet,\" \"The Drummer-Boy,\"\r\nand \"The Boy and the Butterfly;\" but the exigencies of life appear to\r\nprevent him from occupying himself with compositions such as filled\r\nyears in the existence of the old painters.\r\n\r\nPortraiture being the highest and most difficult labor to which an\r\nartist can aspire, to this branch of art Hunt has chiefly confined\r\nhimself, and from this point of view he must be studied. We do not\r\nforget, in saying this, his angel with the flaming torch, strong and\r\nbeautiful and of unearthly presence, nor the shadowy, half-portrayed\r\nfigures which dart and flit across his easel; but as we may\r\n_understand_ the power of Titian from his portraits, yet never\r\nrevel in it fully until we look upon \"The Presentation\" or \"The\r\nAssumption\"--never comprehend the painter's joy or his divine rest in\r\nendeavor until the achievement lies before us--we must speak of Hunt\r\nonly from the work to which he has devoted himself, and not do him the\r\ninjustice to predict dramas he has never yet composed.\r\n\r\nFirst, pre-eminently appears that worship for moral beauty which suffers\r\nhim to fear no ugliness. This power allies him with keen sympathy to\r\nevery living thing. He sees kinship and the immortal spark in each\r\nbreathing being. The soul of love goes out and paints the dark or the\r\nsuffering or the repellant faithfully, bringing it in to the light where\r\nGod's sunshine may fall upon it, and men and women, seeing for the first\r\ntime, may help to wipe away the stain. This tendency he shares with the\r\ngreat French painter Millet, whom he loves to call Master, and with\r\nDore, whose terrible picture of \"The Mountebanks\" should call men and\r\nwomen from their homes to penetrate the fastnesses of vice and strive to\r\nheal the sorrows of their kind.\r\n\r\nThis love of moral beauty, which forces painters to paint such pictures,\r\nwas never in any age more evident. Hunt in his beggar-man, in his\r\nforlorn children, and other pictures of the same class, unfolds a beauty\r\nthat men should be thankful for.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, his love of beauty and his power of expressing it\r\nshould be studied in its _direct_ influence. The beauty of flesh and\r\nblood, even the loveliness of children, seems to have slight hold upon\r\nhim, compared with the significance of character and the lustre with\r\nwhich his imagination endows everything. This lustre is a distinguishing\r\npower with him. The depth to which he sees and feels causes him to give\r\nhigher lights and deeper shadows than other men. White flowers are not\r\nonly white to him--they shine like stars. His pictures give a sense of\r\nsplendor.\r\n\r\nIn his sketch of the poor mother cuddling her child, it is the feeling\r\nof rest, the mother's sleeping joy, the relaxed limbs, the folding\r\nembrace, which he has given us to enjoy. These are the beauty of the\r\npicture--not rounded flesh, nor graceful curves, nor fair complexion;\r\nand so with the singing-girls: they are not beautiful girls, but they\r\nare simple--they love to sing, they are full of tenderness and music. We\r\nmight go over all his pictures to weariness in this way. The young girl\r\nplucking at the daisy as she stands in an open field must, however, not\r\nbe omitted. The natural elegance of this portrait renders it peculiarly,\r\nwe should say, such a one as any woman would be proud to see of herself.\r\nDoubtless this young girl, like others, may have worn ear-rings and\r\nchains and pins and rings, but the artist knew her better than she knew\r\nherself, and has portrayed that exquisite crown of simplicity with\r\nwhich, it should seem, Nature only endows beggars and her royal\r\nfavorites.\r\n\r\nIn all the ages since Hamlet was created there appears never to have\r\nbeen an era in which his character has excited such strong and universal\r\ninterest as in America at this time. William Hunt has thrown upon the\r\ncanvas a figure of Hamlet beautiful and living. There is no suggestion\r\nof any actor in it. Hamlet walks new-born from the painter's brain. His\r\n\"cursed spite\" bends the youthful shoulders, and the figure marches past\r\nunmindful of terrestrial presences.\r\n\r\nOne other picture will illustrate more clearly, perhaps, than everything\r\nwhich has gone before, this gift of imagination. In \"The Boy and the\r\nButterfly,\" now on the walls of the Century Club-house, the loveliness\r\nof the child, the power of action, the subtle management of color and\r\nlight, are all subordinated to the ideas of defeat and endeavor. Energy,\r\nthe irrepressible strength of the spirit upheld by a divine light of\r\nindestructible youth, shines out from the canvas. The boy who cannot\r\ncatch the butterfly is transmuted as we stand into the Soul of Beauty\r\nreaching out in vain for satisfaction, and ready to follow its\r\naspiration to another sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\nWILHELMINE VON HILLERN.\r\n\r\n\r\nGerman literature, despite its extraordinary productiveness and its\r\npossession of a few great masterpieces, is far from being rich in the\r\ndepartment of belles-lettres, especially in works of fiction. It has no\r\nlist of novelists like those which include such names as Fielding, Scott\r\nand Thackeray, Balzac, Hugo and Sand. In fact, there is scarcely an\r\ninstance of a male writer in Germany who has devoted himself exclusively\r\nto this branch of literature, and has won high distinction in it. It has\r\nbeen cultivated with success chiefly by a few writers of the other sex,\r\nwhose delineations have gained a popularity in America only less than\r\nthat which they enjoy at home--in part because the life which they\r\ndepict has closer internal analogies to our own than to that of England\r\nor of France, still more perhaps because the pictures themselves,\r\nwhatever their intrinsic fidelity, are suffused with a romantic glow\r\nwhich has long since faded from those of the thoroughly realistic art\r\nnow dominant in the two latter countries.\r\n\r\nIn none of them is this characteristic more apparent than in the works\r\nof Wilhelmine von Hillern, which bear also in a marked degree the stamp\r\nof a mind at once vigorous and sympathetic, and are thus calculated to\r\nawaken the interest of readers in regard to the author's personal\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nHer father, Doctor Christian Birch, a Dane by birth and originally a\r\ndiplomatist by profession, held for many years the post of secretary of\r\nlegation at London and Paris. He withdrew from this career on the\r\noccasion of his marriage with a German lady connected with the stage in\r\nthe triple capacity of author, manager and actress. Madame\r\nBirch-Pfeiffer, as she is commonly called, was one of the celebrities of\r\nher time, and her dramatic productions still keep possession of the\r\nstage. Soon after the birth of her daughter, which took place at Munich,\r\nshe was invited to assume the direction of the theatre of Zurich. Here\r\nWilhelmine passed several years of her childhood, separated from her\r\nfather, whose engagements as a political writer retained him in Germany,\r\nand scarcely less divided from her mother, whose duties at this period\r\ndid not permit her to give much attention to domestic cares. Without\r\ncompanions of her own age, and left almost wholly to the charge of an\r\ninvalid aunt, she led a monotonous existence, which left an impression\r\non her mind all the more deep from its contrast with the life which\r\nopened upon her in her eighth year, when Madame Birch-Pfeiffer was\r\nsummoned to Berlin to hold an appointment at the court theatre.\r\n\r\nIn the Prussian capital the family was again united, and became the\r\ncentre of a social circle embracing many persons connected with dramatic\r\nart and literature. Devrient, Dawison and Jenny Lind were among the\r\nvisitors whose conversation was greedily listened to by the little girl\r\nwhile supposed to be immersed in her lessons or her plays. Under such\r\ninfluences it would have been strange if even a less active brain had\r\nnot been fired with aspirations, which took the form of an irresistible\r\nimpulse when, at thirteen, Wilhelmine was allowed for the first time to\r\nvisit the theatre and witness the acting of Dawison in Hamlet and other\r\nparts. Henceforth all opposition had to give way, and in her seventeenth\r\nyear she made her _début_ as Juliet at the ducal theatre of Coburg. Two\r\nqualities, we are told, distinguished her acting: a strong conception\r\nworked out in the minutest details, and an intensity of passion which\r\nknew no restraint, and at its culminating point overpowered even hostile\r\ncriticism. Subsequently careful training under Edward Devrient and\r\nMadame Glossbrenner enabled her to bring her emotions under better\r\ncontrol, repressing all tendency to extravagance; and, greeted with the\r\nassurance that she was destined to become the German Rachel, she entered\r\nupon her career with a round of performances at the principal theatres\r\nof Germany, including those of Frankfort, Hamburg and Berlin.\r\n\r\nThese triumphs were followed by the acceptance of a permanent engagement\r\nat Mannheim, which, however, had hardly been concluded when it gave\r\nplace to one of a different kind, followed by her marriage and sudden\r\nrelinquishment of the vocation embraced with such ardor and pursued for\r\na short period with such brilliant promise. Dawison is said to have\r\nremarked that by her retirement the German stage had lost its last\r\ngenuine tragic actress.\r\n\r\nSince her marriage Madame von Hillern has resided at Freiburg, in the\r\ngrand duchy of Baden, where her husband holds a legal position analogous\r\nto that of the judge of a superior court. Her social life is one of\r\ngreat activity, though much of her time is given to superintending the\r\neducation of her two daughters. But the abounding energy of her nature\r\nmade it inevitable that her artistic instincts, repressed in one\r\ndirection, should seek their full development in another. Literature was\r\nnaturally her choice. Her first work, _Doppelleben_, appeared in 1865,\r\nand though defective in construction, owing to a change of plan in the\r\nprocess of composition, served to give assurance of her powers and to\r\ninspire her with the requisite confidence. Three years later _Ein Arzt\r\nder Seele_, of which a translation under the title of _Only a Girl_ has\r\nbeen widely circulated in America, established her claim to a high place\r\namong the writers of her class. Her third work, _Aus eigener Kraft (By\r\nhis own Might)_, met with equal success, securing for its author a large\r\ncircle of readers on both sides of the Atlantic ready to welcome the\r\nfuture productions of her pen. The qualities which distinguish her\r\nwritings are vigor of conception, sharpness of characterization, a moral\r\nearnestness pervading the judgments and reflections, and an ardor,\r\nsometimes too exuberant, which gives intensity to the delineation even\r\nwhile exciting doubts of its fidelity. Similar qualities had\r\ncharacterized her acting, and they spring from a nature which a close\r\nobserver has described as clear in perception yet swayed by fantasy;\r\nstrong of will yet impulsive as quicksilver; finding enjoyment now in\r\nanimated discussion, now in impetuous riding, now in absolute repose;\r\nfull of maternal tenderness, yet fond of splendor and the excitements of\r\nsociety; a nature, in short, abounding in contrasts, but substantially\r\nthat of a true, noble and lovable woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS NAME?\r\n\r\n(_An incident of the Boston fire_.)\r\n\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n             --Oh the billows of fire!\r\n            With maëlstrom-like swirl,\r\n            Their surges they hurl\r\n              Over roof--over spire,\r\n              Mad--masterless--higher,--\r\n            Till with rumble--crack--crash,\r\n            Down boom with a flash,\r\n        Whole columns of granite and marble;--see! see!\r\n        Sucked in as a weed on the ocean might be,\r\n                    Or engulfed as a sail\r\n        In the hurricane riot and wreak of the gale!\r\n\r\n\r\n    II.\r\n\r\n        Ha! yonder they rush where the death-dealing stream,\r\n                    Over-pent, waits their gleam,\r\n        To shiver the city with earthquake!--Who, _who_\r\n        Will adventure, mid-flame, and unfasten the screw,--\r\n        Set the fiend loose, and save us so?--Fireman, you,\r\n        _You_ willing?--Would God you might hazard it!--\r\n              Nay,\r\n        The red tongues are licking the faucets now: Stay!\r\n                --Too late,--'tis too late!\r\n                If ruin comes, wait\r\n        Its coming: To go, is to perish:--Hold!

P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNPUBLISHED LETTER FROM LORD NELSON TO LADY HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[It has been a matter of congratulation that the destruction by the\r\nBoston fire was confined to buildings and other property representing\r\nsimply the wealth of the city, and did not extend to its monuments or\r\nits artistic and literary treasures. The exceptions are, in fact,\r\ncomparatively small in amount, yet they are such as must excite a\r\ngeneral regret. The contents of the studios in Summer street, and the\r\ncollection of armor, unique in this country, bequeathed by the late\r\nColonel Bigelow Lawrence to the Boston Athenaeum, and temporarily\r\ndeposited at 82 Milk street, could not perish without awaking other\r\nfeelings besides that of sympathy with their past or prospective\r\npossessors. A similar loss was that of many of the books and manuscripts\r\namassed by the historian Prescott, and comprising the collections\r\npertaining to the Histories of the Conquest of Mexico and Peru and of\r\nPhilip II. The manuscripts were comprised in some thirty or forty folio\r\nvolumes, and consisted of copies or abstracts of documents in the public\r\narchives and libraries of Europe, in the family archives of several\r\nSpanish noblemen, and in private collections like that at Middle Hill.\r\nThe printed books, of which there were perhaps a thousand, included many\r\nof great value and not a few of extreme rarity. A large mass of private\r\ncorrespondence was also consumed. We are not yet informed whether the\r\nsame fate has befallen a small but very choice collection of autographs,\r\nembracing letters written or signed by Ferdinand and Isabella, Charles\r\nV., Pope Clement VII., Prospero Colonna, the Great Captain, and other\r\nsovereigns and eminent personages of the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies. Very few modern autographs were included in this collection,\r\nthe only examples, we believe, being notes written by Queen Victoria,\r\nPrince Albert and the duke of Wellington, and a longer letter addressed\r\nby Lord Nelson to Lady Hamilton. This last, which we are permitted to\r\nprint from a copy made some time ago, is not exactly a model of\r\ncomposition, but it is very characteristic, and shows the strength of\r\nthat enthrallment which led him, despite his natural kindness of heart,\r\nto risk the lives of his men in order to communicate with the object of\r\nhis passion.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDAY NIGHT, Feb. 15, 9 o'clock [1801].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AMIABLE FRIEND: Could you have seen the boat leave the ship, I\r\nam sure your heart would have sunk within you. _I would not have given\r\nsixpence for the lives of the men_: a tremendous wave broke and missed\r\nupsetting the boat by a miracle. O God, how my heart thumped to see them\r\nsafe! Then they got safe on shore, and I had given a two-pound note to\r\ncheer up the poor fellows when they landed; _but I was so anxious to\r\nsend a letter for you._ I knew it was impossible for any boat to come\r\noff to us since Friday noon, when the boat carried your letters enclosed\r\nfor Napean, and she still remains on shore. Only rest assured I always\r\nwrite, and never doubt your old and dear friend, who never yet deserved\r\nit. The gale abates very little, if anything, and it is truly fortunate\r\nthat our fleet is not in port, or some accident would most probably\r\nhappen; but both St. George and this ship have new cables, which is all\r\nwe have to trust to; but if my friend is true I have no fear. I can take\r\nall the care which human foresight can, and then we must trust to\r\nProvidence, who keeps a lookout for poor Jack. I cannot, my dear friend,\r\nafford to buy the three pictures of the \"Battle of the Nile,\" or I\r\nshould like very much to have them, and Mr. Boyden cannot afford to\r\ntrust me one year. If he could, perhaps I could manage it. I have\r\ndesired my brother to examine the four numbers of the tickets I bought\r\nwith Gibbs. I hope he has told you. I dare say in the office here is the\r\nnumbers of the tickets my agents have bought for the ensuing lottery. I\r\nhope we shall be successful. I hope you always kiss my godchild for me:\r\npray do, and _I will repay you ten times when we meet_, which I hope\r\nwill be very soon. Monday morning. It is a little more moderate, and we\r\nare going to send a boat, but at present none can get to us, and,\r\ntherefore, I send this letter No. (1) to say we are in being. I hope in\r\nthe afternoon to be able to get letters, and, if possible, to answer\r\nthem. Kiss my godchild for me, bless it, and Believe me ever yours,\r\n\r\nNELSON AND BRONTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WHITE-HAT\" DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn one of the last days in September we were the astonished recipients\r\nof a singular and mysterious invitation from a member of the New York\r\nBoard of Brokers. The note contained words like these: \"Come to the\r\nExchange on Monday, September 30th: white hats are declared confiscated\r\non that day.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have puzzled Oedipus or a Philadelphia lawyer to trace the\r\nconnection between white hats and stocks, to tell what Hecuba was to\r\nthem or they to Hecuba, and why they should be more interfered with by\r\nthe New York Stock Exchange on the 30th of September than upon any other\r\nday. It is true that during the last summer some slight political bias\r\nwas supposed to be hidden beneath that popular headpiece irreverently\r\nstyled \"a Greeley plug,\" but then stocks are not politics, nor would any\r\nbut a punster trace an intimate connection between hats and polls. A\r\nstory has gone through the papers, to be sure, about an unfortunate\r\ndeacon who found it impossible to collect the coppers of the\r\ncongregation in a Greeley hat, but then slight excuses have been made\r\navailable on charitable occasions before the present election, and we\r\ndecline to accept the sentiment of that congregation as unmixed devotion\r\nto the Republican candidates. They did not wish to Grant their money,\r\nthat was all.\r\n\r\nAnd then, again, unlike the miller of the old conundrum, men generally\r\nwear _white_ hats to keep their heads cool; with which laudable endeavor\r\nwhy should the Stock Exchange wish to interfere? One never hears of a\r\n\"corner\" in hats. And then, too, was it the bulls or the bears who\r\nobjected to them? Bulls, we all know, have an aversion to scarlet\r\ndrapery, but Darwin, in his studies of the feeling for color among\r\nanimals, has omitted any references to a horror of white hats even among\r\nthe most accomplished of the anthropoid apes.\r\n\r\nPondering all these problems, and many more, our puzzled trio went to\r\nthe Stock Exchange on the last day of September. We were conducted into\r\nthe safe seclusion of the Visitors' Gallery, from which coign of vantage\r\nwe could look down unharmed upon the frantic multitude below. The room\r\nis large and very lofty, its prevailing tint a warm brown, relieved by\r\nbright decorations of the Byzantine order. Across one end runs a small\r\ngallery for visitors, without seats, and some twenty feet above the\r\nfloor, and opposite the gallery is a raised platform, with a long table\r\nand majestic arm-chairs for the president and other officers of the\r\nBoard. High on the wall above these elevated dignitaries glitters in\r\nlarge gold letters the mystic legend, \"New York Stock Exchange.\" On the\r\nleft of the platform stands a large blackboard, whereon the fluctuations\r\nin stocks are recorded, and around the sides of the room are displayed\r\nvarious signs bearing the names of different stocks (like the banners of\r\nthe knights in royal chapels), beneath which eager groups collect. At\r\nthe lower end of the room, under the Visitors' Gallery, are seats\r\nwhereon weary brokers may repose after the brunt of battle. In the\r\ncentre of the upper end of the vast apartment is a long oval\r\ncock-pit--if it may be so called--of two or three degrees, with a table\r\nin the lowest circle. It is so arranged as to give the brokers, standing\r\nupon the graded steps, full opportunity to see and to be seen. On the\r\ntable, in singular contrast with the spirit of the place, was a large\r\nand beautiful basket of flowers. Anything more painfully incongruous it\r\nwould be difficult to imagine. The poor flowers seemed to wear an air of\r\npatient suffering as they wasted their sweetness on that (literally)\r\nhowling wilderness.\r\n\r\nIt was just after ten, and the doors had been open but a few moments\r\nwhen we entered the gallery, already quite full of ladies and\r\ngentlemen--generally very young gentlemen, anxious to learn from the\r\nglorious example of their elders. The floor below us was fast being\r\nstrewn with torn bits of paper, which have to be swept up several times\r\na day. Eager groups were gathered under the various signs upon the walls\r\nand pillars, apparently playing the Italian game of _morra_, to judge by\r\nthe quick gestures of their restless fingers. Some were scribbling\r\ncabalistic signs on little bits of paper, and almost all were howling\r\nlike maniacs or wild beasts half starved. The only place I was ever in\r\nat all to be compared with it in volume and variety of noise is the\r\nparrot-room in the London Zoological Gardens. Bedlam and Pandemonium I\r\nhave not visited--as yet--and consequently cannot speak from personal\r\nexperience. But the parrots in that awful house in Regent's Park are\r\ncapable of making more hideous noises in a given moment than any other\r\nwild beasts in the world, except brokers. Here the human animal comes\r\nout triumphantly supreme.\r\n\r\nTo add to the refreshing variety of the din, long, lanky youths in gray\r\nsauntered about like the keepers of the carnivora, and bawled\r\nincessantly till they were red in the face. These, we were told, were\r\nthe pages, who reported the state of the market and delivered orders and\r\ncommissions. To the uninitiated they were a fraud and a delusion, but so\r\nwas the whole thing. A crowd of men, walking about or standing in\r\ngroups, note-book in hand, talking eagerly or yelling unintelligible\r\nnonsense at the top of their voices, and gesticulating with the fury of\r\nmadmen, while in and around the crowd strolled those extraordinary\r\npages, calmly shouting full in the brokers' faces,--this, we were told,\r\nwas \"business!\" This is the mysterious occupation to which our friends,\r\ncountrymen and lovers devote so large a portion of their time and\r\nthoughts. At this strange diversion millions of dollars change hands in\r\na few hours, and bulls and bears in this little nest agree to make\r\nthings generally uncomfortable and uncertain for the outside world.\r\n\r\nBut where were the white hats, and what of their daring wearers? As the\r\ncrowd thickened, they began to shine out upon the general blackness in\r\nobvious distinction. At first, the howling multitude, eager for filthy\r\nlucre, took no particular notice of them beyond an occasional hurried\r\npoke or pat, but this delusive mildness did not long continue. After the\r\nfirst fifteen or twenty minutes, during which the favorite stocks had\r\nbeen danced up and down a few times, like so many crying babies, the\r\nappetite of the hundred-headed hydra abated a little, and the general\r\nattention to business relaxed. Suddenly--no one knew whence or\r\nwherefore--up rose a white hat in the air, high above the heads of the\r\npeople, and a bareheaded individual was seen struggling wildly in the\r\narms of the mob, who set up ironical cheers at his unavailing efforts to\r\nregain his flying headpiece. It rose and fell faster and farther than\r\nany fancy stock of them all, now soaring to the vaulted roof, now being\r\nkicked along the dusty floor.\r\n\r\n    Press where ye see my white hat shine amidst the ranks of war,\r\n\r\nseemed to be the sentiment of the occasion, as the unruly mob swayed and\r\nstruggled about the dilapidated victim of their sport. In one corner\r\nstood a quiet, dignified gentleman, talking sedately to a little knot of\r\nfriends. He wore a tall white \"stove-pipe\" of the most obnoxious kind.\r\nIn a twinkling it was seized and sent flying toward the roof with its\r\nsofter predecessor. Its owner gave one glance over his shoulder, and\r\n\"smiled a sickly smile,\" while it was very evident that\r\n\r\n    The subsequent proceedings interested him no more.\r\n\r\nThe fun grew fast and furious, the air was literally darkened with\r\nflying hats of every shape and size, but all white. The stout tall\r\nbeavers were converted into footballs till their crowns were kicked out\r\nand their brims torn off, when they were seized upon as instruments for\r\nfurther torture. Some innocent member of the large fraternity, now, to\r\nuse a nautical phrase, scudding under bare _polls_, was pounced upon,\r\nand over his unfortunate head the crownless hat was drawn till the\r\nragged remnant of its brim rested upon his shoulders. One poor creature\r\nwas thus bonneted with at least three tiers of hats, and was last seen\r\non the edge of the cockpit struggling with imminent suffocation.\r\n\r\nAt the height of the howling, scuffling, kicking and fighting a short\r\ndiversion was effected. A tall and portly broker appeared upon the scene\r\nin an entire suit of new broadcloth. It was unmistakably new, its\r\nbrilliancy quite undimmed. Instantly a rush was made for him by the\r\nfickle crowd. They swept him, as by some mighty wave, into the centre of\r\nthe room: they turned him round and round like a pivoted statue, and\r\nexamined him and patted him approvingly on every side. Then they made a\r\nlarge ring round him and gave him three cheers. Not content with this,\r\nwith one sudden impulse they rushed at him again, and tried to lift him\r\nupon the table, that they might see him better. But this the portly\r\nbroker resisted: he fought like a good fellow, and the crowd, tired of\r\nstruggling with a man of so much weight, gave one final cheer and went\r\nback to the chase of the white hats.\r\n\r\nWe stayed about half an hour to watch these elegant and refined\r\ndiversions: at the end of that time our patience and the white hats were\r\ngiving out together. The din was deafening and the dust was rapidly\r\nrising. The floor was strewn with scraps of papers and the mangled\r\nremains of felt and beaver. Brimless hats and hatless brims, linings,\r\nbands, rent and tattered crowns, and ragged fragments of the fray, were\r\nall over the place. A writhing victim in gray, masked by a crownless\r\nhat, was struggling upon the table to the evident danger of those\r\nunhappy flowers; the president was calling across the tumult in\r\nstentorian tones; but the tumult refused to fall, and the imperturbable\r\npages were bawling upon the skirts of the crowd with stolid pertinacity.\r\nThe noise was terrific, the confusion indescribable.\r\n\r\nWe are often told that women are unfitted for business pursuits. If this\r\nwas business, I should say decidedly they were. My acquaintance with\r\nwomen has been large and varied, but I have yet to see the woman whom I\r\nconsider qualified to be a member of the New York Board of Brokers. I\r\nhave been present at many gatherings composed entirely of women, from\r\nthe \"Woman's Parliament\" to country sewing-societies, but never, even in\r\nthat much-abused body, the New York Sorosis, have I seen a crowd of\r\nwomen, however excited, however frolicsome, however full of fun, capable\r\nof playing football with each other's bonnets even upon April Fools'\r\nDay. I am convinced that not even Miss Anthony or Mrs. Stanton would\r\nhave hesitated to admit, had she been present on the auspicious occasion\r\nabove recorded, that there are limits even to woman's sphere. Let her\r\npreach and practice, and sail ships, and make horse-shoes, and command\r\narmies, if she will, let her vote for all sorts of disreputable\r\ncharacters to be set over her, if she choose, but let her recognize the\r\nfact that between her and the gentle amenities of the New York Stock\r\nExchange there is a great gulf fixed, which only the superior being man,\r\nwith his lordly intellect, his keen morality and his exquisite and\r\nunvarying courtesy, can bridge over.\r\n\r\nK.H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SOTHERN AS GARRICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne hundred and thirty-five years ago two young men came up to London to\r\ntry their fortune: half riding, half walking, the young fellows made\r\ntheir journey. One was thick-set, heavy and uncouth, and years afterward\r\nbecame known to men and fame as Samuel Johnson: the other was bright,\r\nslender, active, and was called David Garrick. Some ten years later,\r\njust before the battle of Culloden, a Dutch vessel, having crossed the\r\nChannel, landed at Harwich. There was on board an apparent page, in\r\nreality a young Viennese girl disguised in male attire, who journeyed up\r\nto London too, where she soon made her appearance as a dancer at the\r\nHay-market Theatre: there she achieved great success, and became talked\r\nabout as \"La Violette.\" She was under the patronage of the earl and\r\ncountess of Burlington, and finally became Mrs. Garrick. It is said\r\nthat she was the daughter of a respectable citizen of Vienna--that she\r\nhad been engaged to dance at the palace with the children of the empress\r\nMaria Teresa, but that, her charms proving too attractive to the\r\nemperor, the empress had packed her off to London with letters of\r\nrecommendation to persons of quality there. It seems more probable,\r\nhowever, that she was am actress at Vienna, and simply crossed the sea\r\nto try her fortune in England. Becoming fascinated with Garrick's\r\nacting, she married him after refusing several more brilliant offers,\r\nand in spite of the opposition of her kind patroness, Lady Burlington,\r\nwho wished her to marry so as to secure higher social position. This\r\nmatch gave rise to much romantic gossip. It was said that a wealthy\r\nyoung lady had fallen in love with the great actor one night in\r\n_Romeo_--that he had been induced by her father to come to the house and\r\nbreak the charm by feigning intoxication: some versions had it that he\r\ncame disguised as a physician. A popular German comedy was written upon\r\nit, and still later Mr. Robertson dramatized it for the English stage,\r\nand produced a play in which we have lately had an opportunity of\r\nwitnessing the fine acting of Mr. Sothern. Garrick was certainly\r\nfortunate among actors: he not only achieved high professional fame, but\r\nhe accumulated a large private fortune and lived a happy domestic life\r\nin a splendid home filled with choice works of art. The traveler abroad\r\nwho is favored with an invitation to the Garrick Club, may there see the\r\npicture of the great actor \"in his habit as he lived,\" looking down\r\nnightly on a collection of the most renowned wits and authors of the\r\nmetropolis; and to crown all, when Mr. Sothern acts--were it not for his\r\nmoustache--we might suppose we saw the man himself alive before us.\r\n\r\nConcerning Mr. Sothern's acting, it affords a fine example of that\r\nquality--so very difficult of attainment, it would seem--perfect\r\n_repose_; and by repose we do not mean torpidity or sluggishness or\r\ninattention, as opposed to clamorous ranting, but we mean the complete\r\nsubordination of subordinate parts; so that, if we may use the\r\nillustration, the gaudiness of the frame is not allowed to over-power\r\nand destroy the effect of the picture. Everything is clear, distinct and\r\nwell marked: the forcible passages come with double effect in contrast\r\nwith preceding serenity. The actor's manner is not confined behind the\r\nfootlights: it diffuses itself, as it were, among his audience until it\r\nseems as if they too were acting with him. This arises from the\r\nperfection of the picture he presents, and that perfection is the result\r\nof careful avoidance of everything that is unnatural. There is no\r\n_unnecessary_ exertion put forth, no palpable straining after effect: he\r\nstrives to hold the mirror up to Nature, not Art, and in Nature there is\r\nmuch repose between the tempests. Old players say that the most\r\ndifficult thing to teach a tyro is to stand still, and some actors never\r\nlearn it.\r\n\r\nCareful attention to costume is another trait exhibited by Mr. Sothern.\r\nHe might easily make his first appearance as David Garrick in the\r\nwealthy merchant's house in ordinary walking-dress, which could be\r\nreadily retained when he returns to the dinner-party to which he causes\r\nhimself to be invited. Instead of that, he appears in the full\r\nriding-dress of the period--boots, spurs, whip, overcoat and all. This\r\nis rapidly changed in time for the dinner-scene for a full-dress suit,\r\ncomplete in every point--powdered hair, white silk stockings, and a\r\nlittle _brette_, or walking rapier, peeping out from under the coat\r\nskirt, not slung in a belt as heavier swords, but supported by light\r\nsteel chains fastened to a _chatelaine_, which slips behind the\r\nwaistband and can be taken off in a moment. In the last scene, where he\r\ngoes out to fight the duel, his dress is changed again, and dark silk\r\nstockings are donned as more appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe last point we shall mention here about Mr. Sothern is his scrupulous\r\nattention to the minor business of the stage: when he is not speaking\r\nhimself, his looks act. It is said of Macready that he began to be\r\nCardinal Richelieu at three o'clock in the afternoon, and that it was\r\ndangerous to speak to him after that time. When Mr. Sothern plays Lord\r\nDundreary, if he is addressed on any subject during the progress of the\r\nplay, he answers in his Dundreary drawl, so as not to lose his\r\npersonality for a minute. The letter from his brother \"Tham\" he has\r\nwritten out and reads; not that he does not know every word by heart,\r\nfor he must have read it a hundred times, but because he wants to _turn\r\nover_ at the proper place. We all know what he has made of that part. A\r\nplay in which there is absolutely nothing of a plot, which would fall\r\ndead from the hands of an inferior actor, becomes with Mr. Sothern as\r\npopular as _Rip van Winkle_ is with Jefferson to play the sleepy hero.\r\nIt is to be observed that the three essentials for good acting just\r\nmentioned--repose of manner, strict attention to dress, and strict\r\nattention to minor details of stage-business--may be acquired by any\r\nactor of average intellect who will devote proper time and study to the\r\ntask: they are not, like a fine figure, a handsome face or a sonorous\r\nvoice, adventitious gifts of Fortune which may be bestowed on one mortal\r\nand denied to another. Mr. Sothern owes his success, evidently, to long\r\nand careful preparation of his parts. In David Garrick he leaves but two\r\npoints at which criticism can carp: his pathos somehow lacks sufficient\r\ntenderness, his love-making seems too devoid of passion. When young\r\nGarrick won the heart of La Violette, he put more fire into his speech\r\nand manner than Mr. Sothern exhibits at the close of the last act. He is\r\nrepresented as always loving Ida Ingot, but at first conceals and\r\nsuppresses his love: when the avowal comes at last, it should be like\r\nthe bursting forth of a volcano, hot, fiery and irresistible.\r\n\r\nM. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Richard Wallace evidently aims to make himself, in a small way, the\r\nPeabody of Paris. A cynic might maintain that his gifts were a trifle\r\nsensational, and shaped with a view to procure the greatest amount of\r\nnotoriety at the price; but that they are frequent, and that they show\r\na hearty love for Paris on the Englishman's part, none can deny. It was\r\nSir Richard who not long ago gave about five thousand dollars to the use\r\nof the Paris poor; it was he who, in the late hunting-season, is said to\r\nhave proposed to supply the city hospitals with fresh game--whether of\r\nhis own shooting or of that of his compatriots does not appear; it is\r\nhe, in fine, who has furnished to Paris eighty street-fountains, costing\r\nin the factory six hundred and seventy-five francs each, or a total of\r\nfifty-four thousand francs (say ten thousand eight hundred dollars), the\r\nexpense of setting them up being undertaken by the city. These\r\ndrinking-jets are in the main like those so familiar in American cities,\r\nand are provided, of course, with tin cups attached by iron chains--\"_à\r\nla mode Anglaise_\" add the French papers in an explanatory way. Now, the\r\nextraordinary fact concerning these fountains is, that no sooner had the\r\nfirst installment of nine been put up than all the tin cups, or\r\n\"goblets,\" as the Parisians call them, were stolen. They were renewed,\r\nand again disappeared in a trice. In short, within fifteen days no less\r\nthan forty-seven of these goblets were made way with, despite their\r\nstrong fastenings--that is, an average of over five cups to each\r\nfountain. What the sum-total of plunder has been since the first\r\nfortnight, or whether the fountains are still as useless as spiked\r\ncannon or tongueless bells, we have yet to learn.\r\n\r\nNow comes a contrast. The countrymen of Sir Richard claim that in London\r\nfrom time immemorial not a single cup was ever stolen from the public\r\nfountains. So tempting a theme for generalization could not be resisted\r\nby the Paris newspaper philosophers, who have deduced from this theft of\r\nthe cups a broad distinction between the British loafer and the French\r\nloafer, declaring that the former \"respects any collective property\r\nwhich he partly shares,\" while the latter does not even draw this\r\ndistinction, but grabs whatever he can lay his hands on. \"The luck of\r\nthe Wallace fountains,\" cries one moralizer, \"shows how hard it is to\r\nreform the Paris _gamin_ so long as the law contents itself with its\r\npresent measures. If the state does not speedily educate children found\r\nstraying in the street, it is all up with the present generation.\"\r\nThereupon follows a disquisition on the part which Paris children played\r\nin the Commune. \"Now, the child,\" adds our newspaper Wordsworth, \"is the\r\nman viewed through the big end of the opera-glass;\" and he points his\r\nmoral, therefore, with the need of compulsory education. \"One of the\r\nfirst duties incumbent on the Chamber at the next session will be the\r\nsolution of this question. Let it take as a perpetual goad the fate of\r\nthe Wallace goblets. You begin by stealing a cup of tin--you end by\r\nfiring the Tuileries or plundering the Hôtel Thiers.\" There is a droll\r\nmingling of Isaac Watts and Victor Hugo in this _dénoûment_, and despite\r\nits practical good sense one is amused at the evolution of a grave\r\ndiscourse from so trivial a text as the Wallace drinking-cups.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo people of a statistical rather than a sentimental turn, the\r\nmathematics of marriage in different countries may prove an attractive\r\ntheme of meditation. It is found that young men from fifteen to twenty\r\nyears of age marry young women averaging two or three years older than\r\nthemselves, but if they delay marriage until they are twenty to\r\ntwenty-five years old, their spouses average a year younger than\r\nthemselves; and thenceforward this difference steadily increases, till\r\nin extreme old age on the bridegroom's part it is apt to be enormous.\r\nThe inclination of octogenarians to wed misses in their teens is an\r\nevery-day occurrence, but it is amusing to find in the love-matches of\r\nboys that the statistics bear out the satires of Thackeray and Balzac.\r\nAgain, the husbands of young women aged twenty and under average a\r\nlittle above twenty-five years, and the inequality of age diminishes\r\nthenceforward, till for women who have reached thirty the respective\r\nages are equal: after thirty-five years, women, like men, marry those\r\nyounger than themselves, the disproportion increasing with age, till at\r\nfifty-five it averages nine years.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of marriages for men take place between the ages of\r\ntwenty and twenty-five in England, between twenty five and thirty in\r\nFrance, and between twenty-five and thirty-five in Italy and Belgium.\r\nFinally, in Hungary the number of individuals who marry is seventy-two\r\nin a thousand each year; in England it is 64; in Denmark, 59; in France,\r\n57, the city of Paris showing 53; in the Netherlands, 52; in Belgium,\r\n43; in Norway, 36. Widowers indulge in second marriages three or four\r\ntimes as often as widows. For example, in England (land of Mrs. Bardell)\r\nthere are 66 marriages of widowers against 21 of widows; in Belgium\r\nthere are 48 to 16; in France, 40 to 12. Old Mr. Weller's paternal\r\nadvice, to \"beware of the widows,\" ought surely to be supplemented by a\r\nmaxim to beware of widowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE, in one of his most famous madrigals, draws a vivid contrast\r\nbetween youth and age, which, he declares, \"cannot live together:\"\r\n\r\n    Youth like summer morn,\r\n    Age like winter weather,\r\n    Youth like summer brave,\r\n    Age like winter bare:\r\n    Youth is hot and bold,\r\n    Age is weak and cold.\r\n\r\nScience, which ruthlessly destroys so much poetry by its mattock and\r\nspade, its scales, foot-rules and gauges, must now, we should judge,\r\ntake grave exception to the preceding bit of poesy and to the thousand\r\nrepetitions of its sentiment by the bards of all ages. By means of a\r\nthermometer lately constructed to register with exactitude the degree of\r\nheat in the human body, it is found, after numerous experiments under\r\nvarying circumstances, that the instrument marks 37.08° of heat on an\r\naverage for persons between twenty-one and thirty years of age, while it\r\nmarks 37.46° for people aged eighty. In face of this fact what becomes\r\nof the \"fervors of youth\" and the \"chills of age\"? The highest average\r\ntemperatures in the human body, as indicated by this gauge, are those\r\nwhich exist from birth to puberty--that is to say, 37.55° and 37.63°.\r\nFrom the latter epoch the heat gradually lowers, to rise again with the\r\nfirst approach of old age. Thus childhood shows the highest temperature,\r\nold age the next, and middle life the lowest. We may add that the\r\ngreatest variations in the temperature of the body between health and\r\nsickness are only a few tenths of a degree, according to this\r\nmeasurement; for, the normal condition being 37.2° or 37.3°, an increase\r\nto 38° would mark a burning fever, and a decrease to 36° would note the\r\nicy approach of death. Hereafter, though we may graciously excuse to\r\npoetic license the assertion that\r\n\r\n    Crabbed Age and Youth\r\n    Cannot live together,\r\n\r\nwe must yet sternly protest that the reason assigned--namely, that\r\n\"youth is hot and age is cold\"--is contradicted by the facts of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Life of Charles Dickens. By John Forster. Vol. II. Philadelphia:\r\nJ.B. Lippincott & Co.\r\n\r\nBeginning with Dickens's return from America in 1842, this volume covers\r\na period of less than ten years, the most productive, and apparently the\r\nhappiest, of his life. It brings out in even stronger relief than the\r\npreceding volume his strong individuality, a trait which, whether it\r\nattracts or repels--and on most persons we think it produces alternately\r\neach of these effects--is full of interest, worthy of study and fruitful\r\nof suggestions. Its superabundant energy seemed to create demands in\r\norder that it might expend itself in satisfying them. Its persistence\r\nwas toughened by failure as much as by success. Its vivacity, verging\r\nupon boisterousness, was incapable of being chilled. Its strenuousness\r\nknew no lassitude, and needed no repose. In play as in work, in physical\r\nexercise as in mental labor, in all his projects, purposes and\r\nperformances, Dickens seems to have been in a perpetual state of tension\r\nthat allowed of no reaction. His was a mind not morbidly self-conscious,\r\nbut ever aglow with the consciousness of power and the ardor of its\r\nachievement, in-sensible of waste and undisturbed by critical\r\nintrospection.\r\n\r\nThe excitement into which he was thrown by the composition of his books\r\nexceeds anything of the kind recorded in literary history, and stands in\r\nstrong contrast with the self-contained tranquillity with which Scott\r\nperformed an equal or greater amount of labor. Yet it does not, like\r\nsimilar ebullitions in other men, suggest any notion of weakness or of a\r\ntalent strained beyond its capacity. It was coupled with an enormous\r\nfacility of execution and the ability to pass with undiminished\r\nfreshness from one field of action to another. It sprang from the\r\nintensity with which every idea was conceived, and which belonged\r\nequally to his smallest with his greatest undertakings. \"The book,\" he\r\nwrites of the _Chimes_, \"has made my face white in a foreign land. My\r\ncheeks, which were beginning to fill out, have sunk again; my eyes have\r\ngrown immensely large; my hair is very lank, and the head inside the\r\nhair is hot and giddy. Read the scene at the end of the third part\r\ntwice. I wouldn't write it twice for something.... Since I conceived, at\r\nthe beginning of the second part, what must happen in the third, I have\r\nundergone as much sorrow and agitation as if the thing were real, and\r\nhave wakened up with it at night. I was obliged to lock myself in when I\r\nfinished it yesterday, for my face was swollen for the time to twice its\r\nproper size, and was hugely ridiculous.\" The little book was written at\r\nGenoa; and having finished it, he must make a winter journey to London,\r\n\"because,\" as he writes to Forster, \"of that unspeakable restless\r\nsomething which would render it almost as impossible for me to remain\r\nhere, and not see the thing complete, as it would be for a full\r\nballoon, left to itself, not to go up.\" A further reason was to try the\r\neffect of the story upon a circle of listeners, to be assembled for the\r\npurpose: \"Carlyle, indispensable, and I should like his wife of all\r\nthings; _her_ judgment would be invaluable. You will ask Mac, and why\r\nnot his sister? Stanny and Jerrold I should particularly wish. Edwin\r\nLandseer, Blanchard perhaps Harness; and what say you to Fonblanque and\r\nFox?\" After this it is amusing to read that the book \"was not one of his\r\ngreatest successes, and it raised him up some objectors;\" but the\r\nreading was the germ of those which afterward brought him into such\r\nclose relations with his public.\r\n\r\nOf another Christmas story he writes, \"I dreamed _all last week_ that\r\nthe _Battle of Life_ was a series of chambers, impossible to be got to\r\nrights or got out of, through which I wandered drearily all night. On\r\nSaturday night I don't think I slept an hour. I was perpetually roaming\r\nthrough the story, and endeavoring to dovetail the revolution here into\r\nthe plot. The mental distress quite horrible.\" Here we have, perhaps, a\r\nclear case of the effects of overwork. But in general the details of his\r\nplots, the names of the characters, above all, the titles of the\r\nstories, were evolved with an amount of thought and discussion that\r\nmight have sufficed for the plan and the preparations for a battle.\r\n\"Martin Chuzzlewit\" is not a name suggestive of long and serious\r\ndeliberation: one might rather suppose that it had turned up\r\naccidentally and been accepted simply as being as good as another. Yet\r\nit was not adopted till after many others had been discussed and\r\nrejected. \"Martin was the prefix to all, but the surname varied from its\r\nfirst form of Sweezleden, Sweezleback and Sweeztewag, to those of\r\nChuzzletoe, Chuzzleboy, Chubblewig and Chuzzlewig.\" _David Copperfield_\r\nwas preceded by a still longer list of abortions, and _Household Words,_\r\nas a mere title, was the result of a parturition far exceeding in length\r\nand severity any throes of travail known to natural history.\r\n\r\nAll this was unaccompanied by any of the doubts and misgivings, the fits\r\nof depression and intervals of lassitude, which are the ordinary\r\ntortures of authorship. Nor had it any connection with the weaknesses of\r\nthe craft, its small vanities and jealousies. \"It was,\" as Mr. Forster\r\nwell remarks, \"part of the intense individuality by which he effected\r\nso much to set the high value which in general he did upon what he was\r\nstriving to accomplish.\" Hence, too, no half-formed and then abandoned\r\nprojects were among the stepping-stones of his career. A plan or an\r\nidea, once conceived, was certain to be shaped, developed and matured;\r\nand whatever the result, it left up disheartening effect, no feeling of\r\ndistrust, to cripple a subsequent undertaking.\r\n\r\nNor was Dickens so absorbed in his work as to leave it reluctantly, or\r\nto find no fullness of satisfaction in occupations or enjoyments of a\r\ndifferent kind. On the contrary, no man ever threw himself so heartily\r\nand entirely into the business of the hour, or more eagerly sought\r\ndiversion and change. Dinners, private and public, excursions in chosen\r\ncompanionship, amateur theatricals, schemes of charity or benevolence,\r\noccupied a large portion of his time, and were entered into with an\r\nardor which never flagged or needed to be stimulated. His\r\ncorrespondence--an unfailing barometer to indicate the state of the\r\nmental atmosphere--is always full of life, overflowing, for the most\r\npart, with animal spirits, often vivid in description both of places and\r\npeople, turning discomforts and embarrassments into subjects of lively\r\nnarrative or indignant protest. The letters from Genoa and Lausanne are\r\nespecially copious and entertaining, and form, we think, the most\r\ninteresting portion of the book. The later chapters, giving the final\r\nyear of his residence in Devonshire Terrace, are less satisfactory. We\r\nwould fain have had a picture of that circle of which Dickens was one of\r\nthe most prominent figures; but though his own personality is revealed\r\nin the fullest light, the group in the background is left indistinct,\r\nmost of its members being barely visible, and none of them adequately\r\nportrayed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nÉmaux et Camées. Par Théophile Gautier. Nombre définitif. Paris:\r\nCharpentier; New York: F.W. Christern.\r\n\r\nGautier was polishing and adding to his literary jewelry almost to the\r\nday of his death, and the final edition which he published among the\r\nlast of his works about doubles the number of poems first issued. These\r\nverses are like nothing we have in English. Their imagery is strongly\r\nsophisticated, tortured, brought from vast distances, and then chilled\r\ninto form. Yet they are the most sincere utterances of a soul fed\r\nperpetually among cabinets and picture-galleries, to whom their compact\r\nmethod of utterance is, so to speak, secondarily natural. That they are\r\nprecious and beauteous no one can deny. How sparkling are the successive\r\ndescriptions of women--blonde, brune, Spanish, contralto-voiced,\r\ncoquettish, etc.--whom the poet, like some capricious artist, invites\r\ninto his atelier, drapes hastily with old Moorish or Venetian or\r\ndiaphanous costumes, and then reflects in a diminishing mirror, changing\r\nthe model into a fine statuette of ivory and enamel! More virile and\r\nthoughtful images are intermixed: such are the figures of the old\r\nInvalides seen at the Column Vendôme in a December fog, and for whom he\r\npleads: \"Mock not those men whom the street urchin follows, laughing:\r\nthey were the Day of which we are the twilight--maybe the night!\" Not\r\nless fresh are the two \"Homesick Obelisks\"--that in the Place de la\r\nConcorde, wearying its stony heart out for Egypt, and that at Luxor,\r\nequally tired, and longing to be planted at Paris, among a living crowd.\r\nBut Gautier is a colorist, an artist with words, and he is at his best\r\nwhen he works without much outline, celebrating draperies, bouquets and\r\nlaces, to all of which he can give a meaning quite other than the\r\nmilliner's, as where he asserts that the plaits of a rose-colored dress\r\nare \"the lips of my unappeased desires,\" or describes March as a barber,\r\npowdering the wigs of the blossoming almond trees, and a valet, lacing\r\nup the rosebuds in their corsets of green velvet. Whatever he touches he\r\nleaves artificial, \"enameled,\" yet charming. The verses added in the\r\npresent edition are more pensive, even sombre. A life given to art\r\nwholly, without patriotism or religion or philosophy, does not prepare\r\nthe greenest old age. There is a long and beautiful poem, \"Le Château du\r\nSouvenir,\" which he fills, not exactly with Charles Lamb's \"old familiar\r\nfaces,\" but with portraits of his mistresses and of his old self. There\r\nis the \"Last Vow\"--to a woman he has pursued \"for eighteen years,\" and\r\nwhom he still accosts, though \"the white graveyard lilacs have blossomed\r\nabout my temples, and I shall soon have them tufting and shading all my\r\nforehead.\" There is also the accent of his irresponsible courtiership,\r\nthe facile and unashamed flattery he paid to such a woman as Princess\r\nMathilde. This personage was, or is, an artist; and we may not be\r\nmistaken in believing that we have seen, cast aside in the vast\r\nstorerooms of Haseltine's galleries in this city--an example and gnomon\r\nof disenchanted glory--her water-color sketch called the \"Fellah Woman,\"\r\nand the very one of which Gautier sang: \"Caprice of a fantastic brush\r\nand of an imperial leisure!... Those eyes, a whole poem of languor and\r\npleasure, resolve the riddle and say, 'Be thou Love--I am Beauty.'\"\r\n\r\nThe late poems, however, as well as the old, are filled with felicities.\r\nThey contain many a lesson of the word-master, who, though he did not\r\nattain the Academy, left the French language gold, which he found\r\nmarble. The ornaments, exquisite licenses, foreign graces and wide\r\nresearches which Gautier conferred upon his mother-tongue have enriched\r\nit for future time, and they are best seen in this volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nConcord Days. By A. Bronson Alcott. Boston: Roberts Brothers.\r\n\r\nIn these loose leaves we have the St. Martin's summer of a life. Mr.\r\nAlcott, from his quiet home in Concord, and from the edifice of his\r\nseventy-three years, picks out those mental growths and moral treasures\r\nwhich have kept their color through all the changes of the seasons. They\r\nbear the mark of selection, of choice, from out a vast abundance of\r\nmaterial: to us readers the scissors have probably been a kinder\r\nimplement than the pen. Be that as it may, the selections given are all\r\nworth saving, and the fragmentary resurrection is just about as much as\r\nour age has time to attend to of the growths that were formed when New\r\nEngland thought was young. That was the day when Mrs. Hominy fastened\r\nthe cameo to her frontal bone and went to the sermon of Dr. Channing,\r\nwhen young Hawthorne chopped straw for the odious oxen at Brook Farm,\r\nand when a budding Booddha, called by his neighbors Thoreau, left\r\nmankind and proceeded to introvert himself by the borders of Walden\r\nPond. Mr. Alcott's little diary gives us some of the best skimmings of\r\nthat time of yeast. There is Emerson-worship, Channing-worship, Margaret\r\nFuller-worship and the pale cast of _The Dial_. There is, besides, in\r\nanother stratum that runs through the collection, a vein of very welcome\r\ninvestigation amongst old authors--Plutarch's charming letter of\r\nconsolation to his wife on the death of their child; Crashaw's \"Verses\r\non a Prayer-Book;\" Evelyn's letter on the origin of his _Sylva_; and\r\nmany a jewel five-words-long filched from the authors whom modern taste\r\nvotes slow and insupportable. We mention these to give some idea of the\r\nspirit in which this work of marquetry is executed--a work too\r\nfragmentary and incoherent to be easily describable except by its\r\nspecimens. And while culling fragments, we cannot forbear mentioning the\r\ncurious records of Mr. Alcott's \"Conversations,\" held now with Frederika\r\nBremer, now with a band of large-browed Concord children, held forty\r\nyears ago, and turning perpetually upon the deeper questions of\r\nmetaphysics and religion; we will even indulge ourselves with a short\r\nextract from one of the \"Conversations with Children,\" reported verbatim\r\nby an apparently concealed auditress, and eliciting many a cunning bit\r\nof infantine wisdom, besides the following finer rhapsody, which Mr.\r\nAlcott succeeded in charming out of the lips of a boy six years of age:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Alcott! you know Mrs. Barbauld says in her hymns, everything is\r\nprayer; every action is prayer; all nature prays; the bird prays in\r\nsinging; the tree prays in growing; men pray--men can pray _more_; we\r\nfeel; we have more, more than Nature; we can know, and do right:\r\n_Conscience prays_; all our powers pray; action prays. Once we said,\r\nhere, that there was a Christ in the bottom of our spirits, when we try\r\nto be good. Then we pray in Christ; and that is the whole!\"\r\n\r\nTo think that the lips of this ingenuous and golden-mouthed lad may be\r\nnow pouring out patriotism in Congress is rather sad; but the author's\r\nown career tells us that there are some of the Chrysostoms of 1830 who\r\nhave had the courage to keep quiet, and sweeten their own lives for\r\nfamily use. Mr. Alcott betrays in every line the kindest, sanest and\r\nhumanest spirit; and we wish he could feel how grateful some of us are\r\nfor his example of a thinker who can keep quiet, and a writer who can\r\nshow the power of reticence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThirty Years in the Harem; or, The Autobiography of Melek-Hanum, wife of\r\nH.H. Kibrizli-Mehemet-Pasha. New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nWe have had many revelations from the interior, but nothing quite like\r\nthis. Most histories are valuable in proportion to the truthfulness of\r\nthe narrator, but Mrs. Melek's story owes a large show of its interest\r\nto her obvious tension of the long-bow. It is, in fact, a\r\nself-revelation--the vain and audacious betrayal by an Oriental woman of\r\nthe narrowness, the shallowness, the dishonesty which ages of false\r\neducation have fastened upon her race. The lady in question is--and\r\nevidently knows herself to be--an exception among her countrywomen for\r\nability and acumen: an extreme self-satisfaction and vanity are revealed\r\nin the recital of her most disreputable tricks. She passes for a white\r\nblackbird, a woman of intellect caught in the harem; and it needs but\r\nlittle ingenuity to guess the torment she must have been to her\r\nprotectors--first to the excellent Dr. Millingen, with whom she formed a\r\nlove-match, and whom she abuses--and then to her second husband,\r\nKibrizli, ambassador in 1848 to the court of England, upon whom she\r\nattempted to palm off an heir by the ruse practiced by our own revered\r\nMrs. Cunningham. Whatever the clever Melek does, or whatever treatment\r\nshe receives, it is always she who is in the right, and her eternal\r\n\"enemies\" who are unjust, barbarous and stingy. The ferocious\r\nblackmailing of natives in the Holy Land which she practiced when her\r\nhusband represented the sultan there, is represented as cleverness; but\r\nher divorce after the infamous false accouchement is a piece of\r\npersecution. The marriage and adventures of her daughter form a tangled\r\nromance through which we hear of a great deal more oppression and\r\ncruelty; and the escape into Europe, where the old enchantress appears\r\nto be now prowling in poverty and degradation, concludes the curious\r\nstory. The narrative bears marks of having passed through a French\r\ntranslation and then a British version. To disentangle the thread of\r\nactuality that probably runs through it would be too troublesome and\r\nfutile; but the truths that the wily Melek cannot help telling--the\r\nfacts of the harem and of Eastern life that involuntarily sprinkle it\r\nall like a flavoring of strange spices--these are what give it the odd\r\ndash of interest which keeps it in our hands long after we had meant to\r\ntoss it aside. Here is a \"screaming sister\" of the East--an odalisque\r\nwho was not going to be oppressed and degraded like the other women, but\r\nwho meant to be capable and cultivated and smart, just like the\r\nChristian ladies; and this bundle of lies and crimes and hates is what\r\nshe arrives at.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHints on Dress; or, What to Wear, When to Wear it, and How to Buy it. By\r\nEthel C. Gale, (Putnam's Handy-Book Series.) New York: G.P. Putnam &\r\nSons.\r\n\r\nThis little book will certainly elicit commendation from all who\r\nconsider the subject of dress within the pale of aesthetic treatment;\r\nand, what is still more fortunate, it will probably serve to elevate, in\r\nsome degree, the standard of taste among that large class of persons for\r\nwhom handy volumes are chiefly compiled. Its statements and deductions\r\nare accurate, sensible, comprehensive and practical, and the style in\r\nwhich they are presented is simple and attractive. The color, form and\r\nsuitability of dress, as well as the best methods of economy in its\r\npurchase and manufacture, are intelligently treated. We have only to\r\nregret the want of a chapter devoted to the hygiene of dress, which is a\r\nsubject deserving the earnest attention of every friend of physical\r\ndevelopment. Ten or a dozen pages given to this topic might have done a\r\nservice to hundreds who are willing enough to gather knowledge in\r\npassing, but who are repelled from the separate consideration of any\r\nsubject which seems to call for the exercise of serious thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Sketch Map of the Nile Sources and Lake Region of Central Africa,\r\nshowing Dr. Livingstone's Discoveries and Mr. Stanley's Route. Folio,\r\nfolded. Philadelphia: T. Elwood Zell.\r\n\r\nA clear, well-executed polychrome map, evidently copied from the one\r\nrecently published in England, if not actually printed there. It\r\nexhibits not only the route of Dr. Livingstone during the period\r\nincluded between the years 1866 and 1872, and that taken by Mr. Stanley\r\nin his recent search, but also the course which the former proposes to\r\nfollow in the prosecution of his discoveries. The boundaries of lakes\r\nand the courses of rivers, where definitely known, are indicated by\r\nunbroken lines--where still supposititious, by dotted ones. The map,\r\nwhich is printed on heavy paper, is thirteen inches wide by eighteen\r\ninches long, and being folded within a stiff duodecimo cover, can be\r\neasily preserved and readily consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books Received_.\r\n\r\nPapers relating to the Transit of Venus in 1874.
