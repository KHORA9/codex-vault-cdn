This\r\nmould is generally of a blackish colour and a few inches in thickness.\r\nIn different districts it differs but little in appearance, although it\r\nmay rest on various subsoils.  The uniform fineness of the particles of\r\nwhich it is composed is one of its chief characteristic features; and\r\nthis may be well observed in any gravelly country, where a\r\nrecently-ploughed field immediately adjoins one which has long remained\r\nundisturbed for pasture, and where the vegetable mould is exposed on the\r\nsides of a ditch or hole.  The subject may appear an insignificant one,\r\nbut we shall see that it possesses some interest; and the maxim “de\r\nminimis non curat lex,” does not apply to science.  Even Élie de\r\nBeaumont, who generally undervalues small agencies and their accumulated\r\neffects, remarks: {2} “La couche très-mince de la terre végétale est un\r\nmonument d’une haute antiquité, et, par le fait de sa permanence, un\r\nobjet digne d’occuper le géologue, et capable de lui fournir des\r\nremarques intéressantes.”  Although the superficial layer of vegetable\r\nmould as a whole no doubt is of the highest antiquity, yet in regard to\r\nits permanence, we shall hereafter see reason to believe that its\r\ncomponent particles are in most cases removed at not a very slow rate,\r\nand are replaced by others due to the disintegration of the underlying\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nAs I was led to keep in my study during many months worms in pots filled\r\nwith earth, I became interested in them, and wished to learn how far they\r\nacted consciously, and how much mental power they displayed.  I was the\r\nmore desirous to learn something on this head, as few observations of\r\nthis kind have been made, as far as I know, on animals so low in the\r\nscale of organization and so poorly provided with sense-organs, as are\r\nearth-worms.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1837, a short paper was read by me before the Geological\r\nSociety of London, {3} “On the Formation of Mould,” in which it was shown\r\nthat small fragments of burnt marl, cinders, &c., which had been thickly\r\nstrewed over the surface of several meadows, were found after a few years\r\nlying at the depth of some inches beneath the turf, but still forming a\r\nlayer.  This apparent sinking of superficial bodies is due, as was first\r\nsuggested to me by Mr. Wedgwood of Maer Hall in Staffordshire, to the\r\nlarge quantity of fine earth continually brought up to the surface by\r\nworms in the form of castings.  These castings are sooner or later spread\r\nout and cover up any object left on the surface.  I was thus led to\r\nconclude that all the vegetable mould over the whole country has passed\r\nmany times through, and will again pass many times through, the\r\nintestinal canals of worms.  Hence the term “animal mould” would be in\r\nsome respects more appropriate than that commonly used of “vegetable\r\nmould.”\r\n\r\nTen years after the publication of my paper, M. D’Archiac, evidently\r\ninfluenced by the doctrines of Élie de Beaumont, wrote about my\r\n“singulière théorie,” and objected that it could apply only to “les\r\nprairies basses et humides;” and that “les terres labourées, les bois,\r\nles prairies élevées, n’apportent aucune preuve à l’appui de cette\r\nmanière de voir.” {4a}  But M. D’Archiac must have thus argued from inner\r\nconsciousness and not from observation, for worms abound to an\r\nextraordinary degree in kitchen gardens where the soil is continually\r\nworked, though in such loose soil they generally deposit their castings\r\nin any open cavities or within their old burrows instead of on the\r\nsurface.  Hensen estimates that there are about twice as many worms in\r\ngardens as in corn-fields. {4b}  With respect to “prairies élevées,” I do\r\nnot know how it may be in France, but nowhere in England have I seen the\r\nground so thickly covered with castings as on commons, at a height of\r\nseveral hundred feet above the sea.  In woods again, if the loose leaves\r\nin autumn are removed, the whole surface will be found strewed with\r\ncastings.  Dr. King, the superintendent of the Botanic Garden in\r\nCalcutta, to whose kindness I am indebted for many observations on\r\nearth-worms, informs me that he found, near Nancy in France, the bottom\r\nof the State forests covered over many acres with a spongy layer,\r\ncomposed of dead leaves and innumerable worm-castings.  He there heard\r\nthe Professor of “Aménagement des Forêts” lecturing to his pupils, and\r\npointing out this case as a “beautiful example of the natural cultivation\r\nof the soil; for year after year the thrown-up castings cover the dead\r\nleaves; the result being a rich humus of great thickness.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1869, Mr. Fish {5} rejected my conclusions with respect to\r\nthe part which worms have played in the formation of vegetable mould,\r\nmerely on account of their assumed incapacity to do so much work.  He\r\nremarks that “considering their weakness and their size, the work they\r\nare represented to have accomplished is stupendous.”  Here we have an\r\ninstance of that inability to sum up the effects of a continually\r\nrecurrent cause, which has often retarded the progress of science, as\r\nformerly in the case of geology, and more recently in that of the\r\nprinciple of evolution.\r\n\r\nAlthough these several objections seemed to me to have no weight, yet I\r\nresolved to make more observations of the same kind as those published,\r\nand to attack the problem on another side; namely, to weigh all the\r\ncastings thrown up within a given time in a measured space, instead of\r\nascertaining the rate at which objects left on the surface were buried by\r\nworms.  But some of my observations have been rendered almost superfluous\r\nby an admirable paper by Hensen, already alluded to, which appeared in\r\n1877. {6}  Before entering on details with respect to the castings, it\r\nwill be advisable to give some account of the habits of worms from my own\r\nobservations and from those of other naturalists.\r\n\r\n[FIRST EDITION,\r\n            _October_ 10_th_, 1881.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nHABITS OF WORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature of the sites inhabited—Can live long under water—Nocturnal—Wander\r\nabout at night—Often lie close to the mouths of their burrows, and are\r\nthus destroyed in large numbers by birds—Structure—Do not possess eyes,\r\nbut can distinguish between light and darkness—Retreat rapidly when\r\nbrightly illuminated, not by a reflex action—Power of attention—Sensitive\r\nto heat and cold—Completely deaf—Sensitive to vibrations and to\r\ntouch—Feeble power of smell—Taste—Mental qualities—Nature of\r\nfood—Omnivorous—Digestion—Leaves before being swallowed, moistened with a\r\nfluid of the nature of the pancreatic secretion—Extra-stomachal\r\ndigestion—Calciferous glands, structure of—Calcareous concretions formed\r\nin the anterior pair of glands—The calcareous matter primarily an\r\nexcretion, but secondarily serves to neutralise the acids generated\r\nduring the digestive process.\r\n\r\nEARTH-WORMS are distributed throughout the world under the form of a few\r\ngenera, which externally are closely similar to one another.  The British\r\nspecies of Lumbricus have never been carefully monographed; but we may\r\njudge of their probable number from those inhabiting neighbouring\r\ncountries.  In Scandinavia there are eight species, according to Eisen;\r\n{8a} but two of these rarely burrow in the ground, and one inhabits very\r\nwet places or even lives under the water.  We are here concerned only\r\nwith the kinds which bring up earth to the surface in the form of\r\ncastings.  Hoffmeister says that the species in Germany are not well\r\nknown, but gives the same number as Eisen, together with some strongly\r\nmarked varieties. {8b}\r\n\r\nEarth-worms abound in England in many different stations.  Their castings\r\nmay be seen in extraordinary numbers on commons and chalk-downs, so as\r\nalmost to cover the whole surface, where the soil is poor and the grass\r\nshort and thin.  But they are almost or quite as numerous in some of the\r\nLondon parks, where the grass grows well and the soil appears rich.  Even\r\non the same field worms are much more frequent in some places than in\r\nothers, without any visible difference in the nature of the soil.  They\r\nabound in paved court-yards close to houses; and an instance will be\r\ngiven in which they had burrowed through the floor of a very damp cellar.\r\nI have seen worms in black peat in a boggy field; but they are extremely\r\nrare, or quite absent in the drier, brown, fibrous peat, which is so much\r\nvalued by gardeners.  On dry, sandy or gravelly tracks, where heath with\r\nsome gorse, ferns, coarse grass, moss and lichens alone grow, hardly any\r\nworms can be found.  But in many parts of England, wherever a path\r\ncrosses a heath, its surface becomes covered with a fine short sward.\r\nWhether this change of vegetation is due to the taller plants being\r\nkilled by the occasional trampling of man and animals, or to the soil\r\nbeing occasionally manured by the droppings from animals, I do not know.\r\n{9b}  On such grassy paths worm-castings may often be seen.  On a heath\r\nin Surrey, which was carefully examined, there were only a few castings\r\non these paths, where they were much inclined; but on the more level\r\nparts, where a bed of fine earth had been washed down from the steeper\r\nparts and had accumulated to a thickness of a few inches, worm-castings\r\nabounded.  These spots seemed to be overstocked with worms, so that they\r\nhad been compelled to spread to a distance of a few feet from the grassy\r\npaths, and here their castings had been thrown up among the heath; but\r\nbeyond this limit, not a single casting could be found.  A layer, though\r\na thin one, of fine earth, which probably long retains some moisture, is\r\nin all cases, as I believe, necessary for their existence; and the mere\r\ncompression of the soil appears to be in some degree favourable to them,\r\nfor they often abound in old gravel walks, and in foot-paths across\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nBeneath large trees few castings can be found during certain seasons of\r\nthe year, and this is apparently due to the moisture having been sucked\r\nout of the ground by the innumerable roots of the trees; for such places\r\nmay be seen covered with castings after the heavy autumnal rains.\r\nAlthough most coppices and woods support many worms, yet in a forest of\r\ntall and ancient beech-trees in Knole Park, where the ground beneath was\r\nbare of all vegetation, not a single casting could be found over wide\r\nspaces, even during the autumn.  Nevertheless, castings were abundant on\r\nsome grass-covered glades and indentations which penetrated this forest.\r\nOn the mountains of North Wales and on the Alps, worms, as I have been\r\ninformed, are in most places rare; and this may perhaps be due to the\r\nclose proximity of the subjacent rocks, into which worms cannot burrow\r\nduring the winter so as to escape being frozen.  Dr. McIntosh, however,\r\nfound worm-castings at a height of 1500 feet on Schiehallion in Scotland.\r\nThey are numerous on some hills near Turin at from 2000 to 3000 feet\r\nabove the sea, and at a great altitude on the Nilgiri Mountains in South\r\nIndia and on the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nEarth-worms must be considered as terrestrial animals, though they are\r\nstill in one sense semi-aquatic, like the other members of the great\r\nclass of annelids to which they belong.  M. Perrier found that their\r\nexposure to the dry air of a room for only a single night was fatal to\r\nthem.  On the other hand he kept several large worms alive for nearly\r\nfour months, completely submerged in water. {11}  During the summer when\r\nthe ground is dry, they penetrate to a considerable depth and cease to\r\nwork, as they do during the winter when the ground is frozen.  Worms are\r\nnocturnal in their habits, and at night may be seen crawling about in\r\nlarge numbers, but usually with their tails still inserted in their\r\nburrows.  By the expansion of this part of their bodies, and with the\r\nhelp of the short, slightly reflexed bristles, with which their bodies\r\nare armed, they hold so fast that they can seldom be dragged out of the\r\nground without being torn into pieces. {12}  During the day they remain\r\nin their burrows, except at the pairing season, when those which inhabit\r\nadjoining burrows expose the greater part of their bodies for an hour or\r\ntwo in the early morning.  Sick individuals, which are generally affected\r\nby the parasitic larvæ of a fly, must also be excepted, as they wander\r\nabout during the day and die on the surface.  After heavy rain succeeding\r\ndry weather, an astonishing number of dead worms may sometimes be seen\r\nlying on the ground.  Mr. Galton informs me that on one such occasion\r\n(March, 1881), the dead worms averaged one for every two and a half paces\r\nin length on a walk in Hyde Park, four paces in width.  He counted no\r\nless than 45 dead worms in one place in a length of sixteen paces.  From\r\nthe facts above given, it is not probable that these worms could have\r\nbeen drowned, and if they had been drowned they would have perished in\r\ntheir burrows.  I believe that they were already sick, and that their\r\ndeaths were merely hastened by the ground being flooded.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that under ordinary circumstances healthy worms\r\nnever, or very rarely, completely leave their burrows at night; but this\r\nis an error, as White of Selborne long ago knew.  In the morning, after\r\nthere has been heavy rain, the film of mud or of very fine sand over\r\ngravel-walks is often plainly marked with their tracks.  I have noticed\r\nthis from August to May, both months included, and it probably occurs\r\nduring the two remaining months of the year when they are wet.  On these\r\noccasions, very few dead worms could anywhere be seen.  On January 31,\r\n1881, after a long-continued and unusually severe frost with much snow,\r\nas soon as a thaw set in, the walks were marked with innumerable tracks.\r\nOn one occasion, five tracks were counted crossing a space of only an\r\ninch square.  They could sometimes be traced either to or from the mouths\r\nof the burrows in the gravel-walks, for distances between 2 or 3 up to 15\r\nyards.  I have never seen two tracks leading to the same burrow; nor is\r\nit likely, from what we shall presently see of their sense-organs, that a\r\nworm could find its way back to its burrow after having once left it.\r\nThey apparently leave their burrows on a voyage of discovery, and thus\r\nthey find new sites to inhabit.\r\n\r\nMorren states {14} that worms often lie for hours almost motionless close\r\nbeneath the mouths of their burrows.  I have occasionally noticed the\r\nsame fact with worms kept in pots in the house; so that by looking down\r\ninto their burrows, their heads could just be seen.  If the ejected earth\r\nor rubbish over the burrows be suddenly removed, the end of the worm’s\r\nbody may very often be seen rapidly retreating.  This habit of lying near\r\nthe surface leads to their destruction to an immense extent.  Every\r\nmorning during certain seasons of the year, the thrushes and blackbirds\r\non all the lawns throughout the country draw out of their holes an\r\nastonishing number of worms, and this they could not do, unless they lay\r\nclose to the surface.  It is not probable that worms behave in this\r\nmanner for the sake of breathing fresh air, for we have seen that they\r\ncan live for a long time under water.  I believe that they lie near the\r\nsurface for the sake of warmth, especially in the morning; and we shall\r\nhereafter find that they often coat the mouths of their burrows with\r\nleaves, apparently to prevent their bodies from coming into close contact\r\nwith the cold damp earth.  It is said that they completely close their\r\nburrows during the winter.\r\n\r\n_Structure_.—A few remarks must be made on this subject.  The body of a\r\nlarge worm consists of from 100 to 200 almost cylindrical rings or\r\nsegments, each furnished with minute bristles.  The muscular system is\r\nwell developed.  Worms can crawl backwards as well as forwards, and by\r\nthe aid of their affixed tails can retreat with extraordinary rapidity\r\ninto their burrows.  The mouth is situated at the anterior end of the\r\nbody, and is provided with a little projection (lobe or lip, as it has\r\nbeen variously called) which is used for prehension.  Internally, behind\r\nthe mouth, there is a strong pharynx, shown in the accompanying diagram\r\n(Fig. 1) which is pushed forwards when the animal eats, and this part\r\ncorresponds, according to Perrier, with the protrudable trunk or\r\nproboscis of other annelids.  The pharynx leads into the œsophagus, on\r\neach side of which in the lower part there are three pairs of large\r\nglands, which secrete a surprising amount of carbonate of lime.  These\r\ncalciferous glands are highly remarkable, for nothing like them is known\r\nin any other animal.  Their use will be discussed when we treat of the\r\ndigestive process.  In most of the species, the œsophagus is enlarged\r\ninto a crop in front of the gizzard.  This latter organ is lined with a\r\nsmooth thick chitinous membrane, and is surrounded by weak longitudinal,\r\nbut powerful transverse muscles.  Perrier saw these muscles in energetic\r\naction; and, as he remarks, the trituration of the food must be chiefly\r\neffected by this organ, for worms possess no jaws or teeth of any kind.\r\nGrains of sand and small stones, from the 1/20 to a little more than the\r\n1/10 inch in diameter, may generally be found in their gizzards and\r\nintestines.  As it is certain that worms swallow many little stones,\r\nindependently of those swallowed while excavating their burrows, it is\r\nprobable that they serve, like mill-stones, to triturate their food.  The\r\ngizzard opens into the intestine, which runs in a straight course to the\r\nvent at the posterior end of the body.  The intestine presents a\r\nremarkable structure, the typhlosolis, or, as the old anatomists called\r\nit, an intestine within an intestine; and Claparède {17} has shown that\r\nthis consists of a deep longitudinal involution of the walls of the\r\nintestine, by which means an extensive absorbent surface is gained.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Fig. 1: Diagram of the alimentary canal of an earth-worm.  Fig.\r\n                  2: Tower-like casting from near Nice]\r\n\r\nThe circulatory system is well developed.  Worms breathe by their skin,\r\nas they do not possess any special respiratory organs.  The two sexes are\r\nunited in the same individual, but two individuals pair together.  The\r\nnervous system is fairly well developed; and the two almost confluent\r\ncerebral ganglia are situated very near to the anterior end of the body.\r\n\r\n_Senses_.—Worms are destitute of eyes, and at first I thought that they\r\nwere quite insensible to light; for those kept in confinement were\r\nrepeatedly observed by the aid of a candle, and others out of doors by\r\nthe aid of a lantern, yet they were rarely alarmed, although extremely\r\ntimid animals.  Other persons have found no difficulty in observing worms\r\nat night by the same means. {18a}\r\n\r\nHoffmeister, however, states {18b} that worms, with the exception of a\r\nfew individuals, are extremely sensitive to light; but he admits that in\r\nmost cases a certain time is requisite for its action.  These statements\r\nled me to watch on many successive nights worms kept in pots, which were\r\nprotected from currents of air by means of glass plates.  The pots were\r\napproached very gently, in order that no vibration of the floor should be\r\ncaused.  When under these circumstances worms were illuminated by a\r\nbull’s-eye lantern having slides of dark red and blue glass, which\r\nintercepted so much light that they could be seen only with some\r\ndifficulty, they were not at all affected by this amount of light,\r\nhowever long they were exposed to it.  The light, as far as I could\r\njudge, was brighter than that from the full moon.  Its colour apparently\r\nmade no difference in the result.  When they were illuminated by a\r\ncandle, or even by a bright paraffin lamp, they were not usually affected\r\nat first.  Nor were they when the light was alternately admitted and shut\r\noff.  Sometimes, however, they behaved very differently, for as soon as\r\nthe light fell on them, they withdrew into their burrows with almost\r\ninstantaneous rapidity.  This occurred perhaps once out of a dozen times.\r\nWhen they did not withdraw instantly, they often raised the anterior\r\ntapering ends of their bodies from the ground, as if their attention was\r\naroused or as if surprise was felt; or they moved their bodies from side\r\nto side as if feeling for some object.  They appeared distressed by the\r\nlight; but I doubt whether this was really the case, for on two occasions\r\nafter withdrawing slowly, they remained for a long time with their\r\nanterior extremities protruding a little from the mouths of their\r\nburrows, in which position they were ready for instant and complete\r\nwithdrawal.\r\n\r\nWhen the light from a candle was concentrated by means of a large lens on\r\nthe anterior extremity, they generally withdrew instantly; but this\r\nconcentrated light failed to act perhaps once out of half a dozen trials.\r\nThe light was on one occasion concentrated on a worm lying beneath water\r\nin a saucer, and it instantly withdrew into its burrow.  In all cases the\r\nduration of the light, unless extremely feeble, made a great difference\r\nin the result; for worms left exposed before a paraffin lamp or a candle\r\ninvariably retreated into their burrows within from five to fifteen\r\nminutes; and if in the evening the pots were illuminated before the worms\r\nhad come out of their burrows, they failed to appear.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing facts it is evident that light affects worms by its\r\nintensity and by its duration.  It is only the anterior extremity of the\r\nbody, where the cerebral ganglia lie, which is affected by light, as\r\nHoffmeister asserts, and as I observed on many occasions.  If this part\r\nis shaded, other parts of the body may be fully illuminated, and no\r\neffect will be produced.  As these animals have no eyes, we must suppose\r\nthat the light passes through their skins, and in some manner excites\r\ntheir cerebral ganglia.  It appeared at first probable that the different\r\nmanner in which they were affected on different occasions might be\r\nexplained, either by the degree of extension of their skin and its\r\nconsequent transparency, or by some particular incident of the light; but\r\nI could discover no such relation.  One thing was manifest, namely, that\r\nwhen worms were employed in dragging leaves into their burrows or in\r\neating them, and even during the short intervals whilst they rested from\r\ntheir work, they either did not perceive the light or were regardless of\r\nit; and this occurred even when the light was concentrated on them\r\nthrough a large lens.  So, again, whilst they are paired, they will\r\nremain for an hour or two out of their burrows, fully exposed to the\r\nmorning light; but it appears from what Hoffmeister says that a light\r\nwill occasionally cause paired individuals to separate.\r\n\r\nWhen a worm is suddenly illuminated and dashes like a rabbit into its\r\nburrow—to use the expression employed by a friend—we are at first led to\r\nlook at the action as a reflex one.  The irritation of the cerebral\r\nganglia appears to cause certain muscles to contract in an inevitable\r\nmanner, independently of the will or consciousness of the animal, as if\r\nit were an automaton.  But the different effect which a light produced on\r\ndifferent occasions, and especially the fact that a worm when in any way\r\nemployed and in the intervals of such employment, whatever set of muscles\r\nand ganglia may then have been brought into play, is often regardless of\r\nlight, are opposed to the view of the sudden withdrawal being a simple\r\nreflex action.  With the higher animals, when close attention to some\r\nobject leads to the disregard of the impressions which other objects must\r\nbe producing on them, we attribute this to their attention being then\r\nabsorbed; and attention implies the presence of a mind.  Every sportsman\r\nknows that he can approach animals whilst they are grazing, fighting or\r\ncourting, much more easily than at other times.  The state, also, of the\r\nnervous system of the higher animals differs much at different times, for\r\ninstance, a horse is much more readily startled at one time than at\r\nanother.  The comparison here implied between the actions of one of the\r\nhigher animals and of one so low in the scale as an earth-worm, may\r\nappear far-fetched; for we thus attribute to the worm attention and some\r\nmental power, nevertheless I can see no reason to doubt the justice of\r\nthe comparison.\r\n\r\nAlthough worms cannot be said to possess the power of vision, their\r\nsensitiveness to light enables them to distinguish between day and night;\r\nand they thus escape extreme danger from the many diurnal animals which\r\nprey on them.  Their withdrawal into their burrows during the day\r\nappears, however, to have become an habitual action; for worms kept in\r\npots covered by glass plates, over which sheets of black paper were\r\nspread, and placed before a north-east window, remained during the\r\nday-time in their burrows and came out every night; and they continued\r\nthus to act for a week.  No doubt a little light may have entered between\r\nthe sheets of glass and the blackened paper; but we know from the trials\r\nwith coloured glass, that worms are indifferent to a small amount of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nWorms appear to be less sensitive to moderate radiant heat than to a\r\nbright light.  I judge of this from having held at different times a\r\npoker heated to dull redness near some worms, at a distance which caused\r\na very sensible degree of warmth in my hand.  One of them took no notice;\r\na second withdrew into its burrow, but not quickly; the third and fourth\r\nmuch more quickly, and the fifth as quickly as possible.  The light from\r\na candle, concentrated by a lens and passing through a sheet of glass\r\nwhich would intercept most of the heat-rays, generally caused a much more\r\nrapid retreat than did the heated poker.  Worms are sensitive to a low\r\ntemperature, as may be inferred from their not coming out of their\r\nburrows during a frost.\r\n\r\nWorms do not possess any sense of hearing.  They took not the least\r\nnotice of the shrill notes from a metal whistle, which was repeatedly\r\nsounded near them; nor did they of the deepest and loudest tones of a\r\nbassoon.  They were indifferent to shouts, if care was taken that the\r\nbreath did not strike them.  When placed on a table close to the keys of\r\na piano, which was played as loudly as possible, they remained perfectly\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are indifferent to undulations in the air audible by us,\r\nthey are extremely sensitive to vibrations in any solid object.  When the\r\npots containing two worms which had remained quite indifferent to the\r\nsound of the piano, were placed on this instrument, and the note C in the\r\nbass clef was struck, both instantly retreated into their burrows.  After\r\na time they emerged, and when G above the line in the treble clef was\r\nstruck they again retreated.  Under similar circumstances on another\r\nnight one worm dashed into its burrow on a very high note being struck\r\nonly once, and the other worm when C in the treble clef was struck.  On\r\nthese occasions the worms were not touching the sides of the pots, which\r\nstood in saucers; so that the vibrations, before reaching their bodies,\r\nhad to pass from the sounding board of the piano, through the saucer, the\r\nbottom of the pot and the damp, not very compact earth on which they lay\r\nwith their tails in their burrows.  They often showed their sensitiveness\r\nwhen the pot in which they lived, or the table on which the pot stood,\r\nwas accidentally and lightly struck; but they appeared less sensitive to\r\nsuch jars than to the vibrations of the piano; and their sensitiveness to\r\njars varied much at different times.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that if the ground is beaten or otherwise made to\r\ntremble, worms believe that they are pursued by a mole and leave their\r\nburrows.  From one account that I have received, I have no doubt that\r\nthis is often the case; but a gentleman informs me that he lately saw\r\neight or ten worms leave their burrows and crawl about the grass on some\r\nboggy land on which two men had just trampled while setting a trap; and\r\nthis occurred in a part of Ireland where there were no moles.  I have\r\nbeen assured by a Volunteer that he has often seen many large earth-worms\r\ncrawling quickly about the grass, a few minutes after his company had\r\nfired a volley with blank cartridges.  The Peewit (_Tringa vanellus_,\r\nLinn.) seems to know instinctively that worms will emerge if the ground\r\nis made to tremble; for Bishop Stanley states (as I hear from Mr.\r\nMoorhouse) that a young peewit kept in confinement used to stand on one\r\nleg and beat the turf with the other leg until the worms crawled out of\r\ntheir burrows, when they were instantly devoured.  Nevertheless, worms do\r\nnot invariably leave their burrows when the ground is made to tremble, as\r\nI know by having beaten it with a spade, but perhaps it was beaten too\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\nThe whole body of a worm is sensitive to contact.  A slight puff of air\r\nfrom the mouth causes an instant retreat.  The glass plates placed over\r\nthe pots did not fit closely, and blowing through the very narrow chinks\r\nthus left, often sufficed to cause a rapid retreat.  They sometimes\r\nperceived the eddies in the air caused by quickly removing the glass\r\nplates.  When a worm first comes out of its burrow, it generally moves\r\nthe much extended anterior extremity of its body from side to side in all\r\ndirections, apparently as an organ of touch; and there is some reason to\r\nbelieve, as we shall see in the next chapter, that they are thus enabled\r\nto gain a general notion of the form of an object.  Of all their senses\r\nthat of touch, including in this term the perception of a vibration,\r\nseems much the most highly developed.\r\n\r\nIn worms the sense of smell apparently is confined to the perception of\r\ncertain odours, and is feeble.  They were quite indifferent to my breath,\r\nas long as I breathed on them very gently.  This was tried, because it\r\nappeared possible that they might thus be warned of the approach of an\r\nenemy.  They exhibited the same indifference to my breath whilst I chewed\r\nsome tobacco, and while a pellet of cotton-wool with a few drops of\r\nmillefleurs perfume or of acetic acid was kept in my mouth.  Pellets of\r\ncotton-wool soaked in tobacco juice, in millefleurs perfume, and in\r\nparaffin, were held with pincers and were waved about within two or three\r\ninches of several worms, but they took no notice.  On one or two\r\noccasions, however, when acetic acid had been placed on the pellets, the\r\nworms appeared a little uneasy, and this was probably due to the\r\nirritation of their skins.  The perception of such unnatural odours would\r\nbe of no service to worms; and as such timid creatures would almost\r\ncertainly exhibit some signs of any new impression, we may conclude that\r\nthey did not perceive these odours.\r\n\r\nThe result was different when cabbage-leaves and pieces of onion were\r\nemployed, both of which are devoured with much relish by worms.  Small\r\nsquare pieces of fresh and half-decayed cabbage-leaves and of onion bulbs\r\nwere on nine occasions buried in my pots, beneath about ¼ of an inch of\r\ncommon garden soil; and they were always discovered by the worms.  One\r\nbit of cabbage was discovered and removed in the course of two hours;\r\nthree were removed by the next morning, that is, after a single night;\r\ntwo others after two nights; and the seventh bit after three nights.  Two\r\npieces of onion were discovered and removed after three nights.  Bits of\r\nfresh raw meat, of which worms are very fond, were buried, and were not\r\ndiscovered within forty-eight hours, during which time they had not\r\nbecome putrid.  The earth above the various buried objects was generally\r\npressed down only slightly, so as not to prevent the emission of any\r\nodour.  On two occasions, however, the surface was well watered, and was\r\nthus rendered somewhat compact.  After the bits of cabbage and onion had\r\nbeen removed, I looked beneath them to see whether the worms had\r\naccidentally come up from below, but there was no sign of a burrow; and\r\ntwice the buried objects were laid on pieces of tin-foil which were not\r\nin the least displaced.  It is of course possible that the worms whilst\r\nmoving about on the surface of the ground, with their tails affixed\r\nwithin their burrows, may have poked their heads into the places where\r\nthe above objects were buried; but I have never seen worms acting in this\r\nmanner.  Some pieces of cabbage-leaf and of onion were twice buried\r\nbeneath very fine ferruginous sand, which was slightly pressed down and\r\nwell watered, so as to be rendered very compact, and these pieces were\r\nnever discovered.  On a third occasion the same kind of sand was neither\r\npressed down nor watered, and the pieces of cabbage were discovered and\r\nremoved after the second night.  These several facts indicate that worms\r\npossess some power of smell; and that they discover by this means\r\nodoriferous and much-coveted kinds of food.\r\n\r\nIt may be presumed that all animals which feed on various substances\r\npossess the sense of taste, and this is certainly the case with worms.\r\nCabbage-leaves are much liked by worms; and it appears that they can\r\ndistinguish between different varieties; but this may perhaps be owing to\r\ndifferences in their texture.  On eleven occasions pieces of the fresh\r\nleaves of a common green variety and of the red variety used for pickling\r\nwere given them, and they preferred the green, the red being either\r\nwholly neglected or much less gnawed.  On two other occasions, however,\r\nthey seemed to prefer the red.  Half-decayed leaves of the red variety\r\nand fresh leaves of the green were attacked about equally.  When leaves\r\nof the cabbage, horse-radish (a favourite food) and of the onion were\r\ngiven together, the latter were always, and manifestly preferred.  Leaves\r\nof the cabbage, lime-tree, Ampelopsis, parsnip (Pastinaca), and celery\r\n(Apium) were likewise given together; and those of the celery were first\r\neaten.  But when leaves of cabbage, turnip, beet, celery, wild cherry and\r\ncarrots were given together, the two latter kinds, especially those of\r\nthe carrot, were preferred to all the others, including those of celery.\r\nIt was also manifest after many trials that wild cherry leaves were\r\ngreatly preferred to those of the lime-tree and hazel (Corylus).\r\nAccording to Mr. Bridgman the half-decayed leaves of _Phlox verna_ are\r\nparticularly liked by worms. {31}\r\n\r\nPieces of the leaves of cabbage, turnip, horse-radish and onion were left\r\non the pots during 22 days, and were all attacked and had to be renewed;\r\nbut during the whole of this time leaves of an Artemisia and of the\r\nculinary sage, thyme and mint, mingled with the above leaves, were quite\r\nneglected excepting those of the mint, which were occasionally and very\r\nslightly nibbled.  These latter four kinds of leaves do not differ in\r\ntexture in a manner which could make them disagreeable to worms; they all\r\nhave a strong taste, but so have the four first mentioned kinds of\r\nleaves; and the wide difference in the result must be attributed to a\r\npreference by the worms for one taste over another.\r\n\r\n_Mental Qualities_.—There is little to be said on this head.  We have\r\nseen that worms are timid.  It may be doubted whether they suffer as much\r\npain when injured, as they seem to express by their contortions.  Judging\r\nby their eagerness for certain kinds of food, they must enjoy the\r\npleasure of eating.  Their sexual passion is strong enough to overcome\r\nfor a time their dread of light.  They perhaps have a trace of social\r\nfeeling, for they are not disturbed by crawling over each other’s bodies,\r\nand they sometimes lie in contact.  According to Hoffmeister they pass\r\nthe winter either singly or rolled up with others into a ball at the\r\nbottom of their burrows. {32}  Although worms are so remarkably deficient\r\nin the several sense-organs, this does not necessarily preclude\r\nintelligence, as we know from such cases as those of Laura Bridgman; and\r\nwe have seen that when their attention is engaged, they neglect\r\nimpressions to which they would otherwise have attended; and attention\r\nindicates the presence of a mind of some kind.  They are also much more\r\neasily excited at certain times than at others.  They perform a few\r\nactions instinctively, that is, all the individuals, including the young,\r\nperform such actions in nearly the same fashion.  This is shown by the\r\nmanner in which the species of Perichæta eject their castings, so as to\r\nconstruct towers; also by the manner in which the burrows of the common\r\nearth-worm are smoothly lined with fine earth and often with little\r\nstones, and the mouths of their burrows with leaves.  One of their\r\nstrongest instincts is the plugging up the mouths of their burrows with\r\nvarious objects; and very young worms act in this manner.  But some\r\ndegree of intelligence appears, as we shall see in the next chapter, to\r\nbe exhibited in this work,—a result which has surprised me more than\r\nanything else in regard to worms.\r\n\r\n_Food and Digestion_.—Worms are omnivorous.  They swallow an enormous\r\nquantity of earth, out of which they extract any digestible matter which\r\nit may contain; but to this subject I must recur.  They also consume a\r\nlarge number of half-decayed leaves of all kinds, excepting a few which\r\nhave an unpleasant taste or are too tough for them; likewise petioles,\r\npeduncles, and decayed flowers.  But they will also consume fresh leaves,\r\nas I have found by repeated trials.  According to Morren {33} they will\r\neat particles of sugar and liquorice; and the worms which I kept drew\r\nmany bits of dry starch into their burrows, and a large bit had its\r\nangles well rounded by the fluid poured out of their mouths.  But as they\r\noften drag particles of soft stone, such as of chalk, into their burrows,\r\nI feel some doubt whether the starch was used as food.  Pieces of raw and\r\nroasted meat were fixed several times by long pins to the surface of the\r\nsoil in my pots, and night after night the worms could be seen tugging at\r\nthem, with the edges of the pieces engulfed in their mouths, so that much\r\nwas consumed.  Raw fat seems to be preferred even to raw meat or to any\r\nother substance which was given them, and much was consumed.  They are\r\ncannibals, for the two halves of a dead worm placed in two of the pots\r\nwere dragged into the burrows and gnawed; but as far as I could judge,\r\nthey prefer fresh to putrid meat, and in so far I differ from\r\nHoffmeister.\r\n\r\nLéon Fredericq states {34} that the digestive fluid of worms is of the\r\nsame nature as the pancreatic secretion of the higher animals; and this\r\nconclusion agrees perfectly with the kinds of food which worms consume.\r\nPancreatic juice emulsifies fat, and we have just seen how greedily worms\r\ndevour fat; it dissolves fibrin, and worms eat raw meat; it converts\r\nstarch into grape-sugar with wonderful rapidity, and we shall presently\r\nshow that the digestive fluid of worms acts on starch. {35a}  But they\r\nlive chiefly on half-decayed leaves; and these would be useless to them\r\nunless they could digest the cellulose forming the cell-walls; for it is\r\nwell known that all other nutritious substances are almost completely\r\nwithdrawn from leaves, shortly before they fall off.  It has, however,\r\nnow been ascertained that some forms of cellulose, though very little or\r\nnot at all attacked by the gastric secretion of the higher animals, are\r\nacted on by that from the pancreas. {35b}\r\n\r\nThe half-decayed or fresh leaves which worms intend to devour, are\r\ndragged into the mouths of their burrows to a depth of from one to three\r\ninches, and are then moistened with a secreted fluid.  It has been\r\nassumed that this fluid serves to hasten their decay; but a large number\r\nof leaves were twice pulled out of the burrows of worms and kept for many\r\nweeks in a very moist atmosphere under a bell-glass in my study; and the\r\nparts which had been moistened by the worms did not decay more quickly in\r\nany plain manner than the other parts.  When fresh leaves were given in\r\nthe evening to worms kept in confinement and examined early on the next\r\nmorning, therefore not many hours after they had been dragged into the\r\nburrows, the fluid with which they were moistened, when tested with\r\nneutral litmus paper, showed an alkaline reaction.  This was repeatedly\r\nfound to be the case with celery, cabbage and turnip leaves.  Parts of\r\nthe same leaves which had not been moistened by the worms, were pounded\r\nwith a few drops of distilled water, and the juice thus extracted was not\r\nalkaline.  Some leaves, however, which had been drawn into burrows out of\r\ndoors, at an unknown antecedent period, were tried, and though still\r\nmoist, they rarely exhibited even a trace of alkaline reaction.\r\n\r\nThe fluid, with which the leaves are bathed, acts on them whilst they are\r\nfresh or nearly fresh, in a remarkable manner; for it quickly kills and\r\ndiscolours them.  Thus the ends of a fresh carrot-leaf, which had been\r\ndragged into a burrow, were found after twelve hours of a dark brown\r\ntint.  Leaves of celery, turnip, maple, elm, lime, thin leaves of ivy,\r\nand, occasionally those of the cabbage were similarly acted on.  The end\r\nof a leaf of _Triticum repens_, still attached to a growing plant, had\r\nbeen drawn into a burrow, and this part was dark brown and dead, whilst\r\nthe rest of the leaf was fresh and green.  Several leaves of lime and elm\r\nremoved from burrows out of doors were found affected in different\r\ndegrees.  The first change appears to be that the veins become of a dull\r\nreddish-orange.  The cells with chlorophyll next lose more or less\r\ncompletely their green colour, and their contents finally become brown.\r\nThe parts thus affected often appeared almost black by reflected light;\r\nbut when viewed as a transparent object under the microscope, minute\r\nspecks of light were transmitted, and this was not the case with the\r\nunaffected parts of the same leaves.  These effects, however, merely show\r\nthat the secreted fluid is highly injurious or poisonous to leaves; for\r\nnearly the same effects were produced in from one to two days on various\r\nkinds of young leaves, not only by artificial pancreatic fluid, prepared\r\nwith or without thymol, but quickly by a solution of thymol by itself.\r\nOn one occasion leaves of Corylus were much discoloured by being kept for\r\neighteen hours in pancreatic fluid, without any thymol.  With young and\r\ntender leaves immersion in human saliva during rather warm weather, acted\r\nin the same manner as the pancreatic fluid, but not so quickly.  The\r\nleaves in all these cases often became infiltrated with the fluid.\r\n\r\nLarge leaves from an ivy plant growing on a wall were so tough that they\r\ncould not be gnawed by worms, but after four days they were affected in a\r\npeculiar manner by the secretion poured out of their mouths.  The upper\r\nsurfaces of the leaves, over which the worms had crawled, as was shown by\r\nthe dirt left on them, were marked in sinuous lines, by either a\r\ncontinuous or broken chain of whitish and often star-shaped dots, about 2\r\nmm. in diameter.  The appearance thus presented was curiously like that\r\nof a leaf, into which the larva of some minute insect had burrowed.  But\r\nmy son Francis, after making and examining sections, could nowhere find\r\nthat the cell-walls had been broken down or that the epidermis had been\r\npenetrated.  When the section passed through the whitish dots, the grains\r\nof chlorophyll were seen to be more or less discoloured, and some of the\r\npalisade and mesophyll cells contained nothing but broken down granular\r\nmatter.  These effects must be attributed to the transudation of the\r\nsecretion through the epidermis into the cells.\r\n\r\nThe secretion with which worms moisten leaves likewise acts on the\r\nstarch-granules within the cells.  My son examined some leaves of the ash\r\nand many of the lime, which had fallen off the trees and had been partly\r\ndragged into worm-burrows.  It is known that with fallen leaves the\r\nstarch-grains are preserved in the guard-cells of the stomata.  Now in\r\nseveral cases the starch had partially or wholly disappeared from these\r\ncells, in the parts which had been moistened by the secretion; while it\r\nwas still well preserved in the other parts of the same leaves.\r\nSometimes the starch was dissolved out of only one of the two\r\nguard-cells.  The nucleus in one case had disappeared, together with the\r\nstarch-granules.  The mere burying of lime-leaves in damp earth for nine\r\ndays did not cause the destruction of the starch-granules.  On the other\r\nhand, the immersion of fresh lime and cherry leaves for eighteen hours in\r\nartificial pancreatic fluid, led to the dissolution of the\r\nstarch-granules in the guard-cells as well as in the other cells.\r\n\r\nFrom the secretion with which the leaves are moistened being alkaline,\r\nand from its acting both on the starch-granules and on the protoplasmic\r\ncontents of the cells, we may infer that it resembles in nature not\r\nsaliva, {40} but pancreatic secretion; and we know from Fredericq that a\r\nsecretion of this kind is found in the intestines of worms.  As the\r\nleaves which are dragged into the burrows are often dry and shrivelled,\r\nit is indispensable for their disintegration by the unarmed mouths of\r\nworms that they should first be moistened and softened; and fresh leaves,\r\nhowever soft and tender they may be, are similarly treated, probably from\r\nhabit.  The result is that they are partially digested before they are\r\ntaken into the alimentary canal.  I am not aware of any other case of\r\nextra-stomachal digestion having been recorded.  The boa-constrictor is\r\nsaid to bathe its prey with saliva, but this is doubtful; and it is done\r\nsolely for the sake of lubricating its prey.  Perhaps the nearest analogy\r\nmay be found in such plants as Drosera and Dionæa; for here animal matter\r\nis digested and converted into peptone not within a stomach, but on the\r\nsurfaces of the leaves.\r\n\r\n_Calciferous Glands_.—These glands (see Fig. 1), judging from their size\r\nand from their rich supply of blood-vessels, must be of much importance\r\nto the animal.  But almost as many theories have been advanced on their\r\nuse as there have been observers.  They consist of three pairs, which in\r\nthe common earth-worm debouch into the alimentary canal in advance of the\r\ngizzard, but posteriorly to it in Urochæta and some other genera. {41a}\r\nThe two posterior pairs are formed by lamellæ, which, according to\r\nClaparède, are diverticula from the œsophagus. {41b}  These lamellæ are\r\ncoated with a pulpy cellular layer, with the outer cells lying free in\r\ninfinite numbers.  If one of these glands is punctured and squeezed, a\r\nquantity of white pulpy matter exudes, consisting of these free cells.\r\nThey are minute, and vary in diameter from 2 to 6 _μ_.  They contain in\r\ntheir centres a little excessively fine granular matter; but they look so\r\nlike oil globules that Claparède and others at first treated them with\r\nether.  This produces no effect; but they are quickly dissolved with\r\neffervescence in acetic acid, and when oxalate of ammonia is added to the\r\nsolution a white precipitate is thrown down.  We may therefore conclude\r\nthat they contain carbonate of lime.  If the cells are immersed in a very\r\nlittle acid, they become more transparent, look like ghosts, and are soon\r\nlost to view; but if much acid is added, they disappear instantly.  After\r\na very large number have been dissolved, a flocculent residue is left,\r\nwhich apparently consists of the delicate ruptured cell-walls.  In the\r\ntwo posterior pairs of glands the carbonate of lime contained in the\r\ncells occasionally aggregates into small rhombic crystals or into\r\nconcretions, which lie between the lamellæ; but I have seen only one\r\ncase, and Claparède only a very few such cases.\r\n\r\nThe two anterior glands differ a little in shape from the four posterior\r\nones, by being more oval.  They differ also conspicuously in generally\r\ncontaining several small, or two or three larger, or a single very large\r\nconcretion of carbonate of lime, as much as 1½ mm. in diameter.  When a\r\ngland includes only a few very small concretions, or, as sometimes\r\nhappens, none at all, it is easily overlooked.  The large concretions are\r\nround or oval, and exteriorly almost smooth.  One was found which filled\r\nup not only the whole gland, as is often the case, but its neck; so that\r\nit resembled an olive-oil flask in shape.  These concretions when broken\r\nare seen to be more or less crystalline in structure.  How they escape\r\nfrom the gland is a marvel; but that they do escape is certain, for they\r\nare often found in the gizzard, intestines, and in the castings of worms,\r\nboth with those kept in confinement and those in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nClaparède says very little about the structure of the two anterior\r\nglands, and he supposes that the calcareous matter of which the\r\nconcretions are formed is derived from the four posterior glands.  But if\r\nan anterior gland which contains only small concretions is placed in\r\nacetic acid and afterwards dissected, or if sections are made of such a\r\ngland without being treated with acid, lamellæ like those in the\r\nposterior glands and coated with cellular matter could be plainly seen,\r\ntogether with a multitude of free calciferous cells readily soluble in\r\nacetic acid.  When a gland is completely filled with a single large\r\nconcretion, there are no free cells, as these have been all consumed in\r\nforming the concretion.  But if such a concretion, or one of only\r\nmoderately large size, is dissolved in acid, much membranous matter is\r\nleft, which appears to consist of the remains of the formerly active\r\nlamellæ.  After the formation and expulsion of a large concretion, new\r\nlamellæ must be developed in some manner.  In one section made by my son,\r\nthe process had apparently commenced, although the gland contained two\r\nrather large concretions, for near the walls several cylindrical and oval\r\npipes were intersected, which were lined with cellular matter and were\r\nquite filled with free calciferous cells.  A great enlargement in one\r\ndirection of several oval pipes would give rise to the lamellæ.\r\n\r\nBesides the free calciferous cells in which no nucleus was visible, other\r\nand rather larger free cells were seen on three occasions; and these\r\ncontained a distinct nucleus and nucleolus.  They were only so far acted\r\non by acetic acid that the nucleus was thus rendered more distinct.  A\r\nvery small concretion was removed from between two of the lamellæ within\r\nan anterior gland.  It was imbedded in pulpy cellular matter, with many\r\nfree calciferous cells, together with a multitude of the larger, free,\r\nnucleated cells, and these latter cells were not acted on by acetic acid,\r\nwhile the former were dissolved.  From this and other such cases I am led\r\nto suspect that the calciferous cells are developed from the larger\r\nnucleated ones; but how this was effected was not ascertained.\r\n\r\nWhen an anterior gland contains several minute concretions, some of these\r\nare generally angular or crystalline in outline, while the greater number\r\nare rounded with an irregular mulberry-like surface.  Calciferous cells\r\nadhered to many parts of these mulberry-like masses, and their gradual\r\ndisappearance could be traced while they still remained attached.  It was\r\nthus evident that the concretions are formed from the lime contained\r\nwithin the free calciferous cells.  As the smaller concretions increase\r\nin size, they come into contact and unite, thus enclosing the now\r\nfunctionless lamellæ; and by such steps the formation of the largest\r\nconcretions could be followed.  Why the process regularly takes place in\r\nthe two anterior glands, and only rarely in the four posterior glands, is\r\nquite unknown.  Morren says that these glands disappear during the\r\nwinter; and I have seen some instances of this fact, and others in which\r\neither the anterior or posterior glands were at this season so shrunk and\r\nempty, that they could be distinguished only with much difficulty.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the function of the calciferous glands, it is probable\r\nthat they primarily serve as organs of excretion, and secondarily as an\r\naid to digestion.  Worms consume many fallen leaves; and it is known that\r\nlime goes on accumulating in leaves until they drop off the parent-plant,\r\ninstead of being re-absorbed into the stem or roots, like various other\r\norganic and inorganic substances. {46}  The ashes of a leaf of an acacia\r\nhave been known to contain as much as 72 per cent. of lime.  Worms\r\ntherefore would be liable to become charged with this earth, unless there\r\nwere some special means for its excretion; and the calciferous glands are\r\nwell adapted for this purpose.  The worms which live in mould close over\r\nthe chalk, often have their intestines filled with this substance, and\r\ntheir castings are almost white.  Here it is evident that the supply of\r\ncalcareous matter must be super-abundant.  Nevertheless with several\r\nworms collected on such a site, the calciferous glands contained as many\r\nfree calciferous cells, and fully as many and large concretions, as did\r\nthe glands of worms which lived where there was little or no lime; and\r\nthis indicates that the lime is an excretion, and not a secretion poured\r\ninto the alimentary canal for some special purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the following considerations render it highly probable\r\nthat the carbonate of lime, which is excreted by the glands, aids the\r\ndigestive process under ordinary circumstances.  Leaves during their\r\ndecay generate an abundance of various kinds of acids, which have been\r\ngrouped together under the term of humus acids.  We shall have to recur\r\nto this subject in our fifth chapter, and I need here only say that these\r\nacids act strongly on carbonate of lime.  The half-decayed leaves which\r\nare swallowed in such large quantities by worms would, therefore, after\r\nthey have been moistened and triturated in the alimentary canal, be apt\r\nto produce such acids.  And in the case of several worms, the contents of\r\nthe alimentary canal were found to be plainly acid, as shown by litmus\r\npaper.  This acidity cannot be attributed to the nature of the digestive\r\nfluid, for pancreatic fluid is alkaline; and we have seen that the\r\nsecretion which is poured out of the mouths of worms for the sake of\r\npreparing the leaves for consumption, is likewise alkaline.  The acidity\r\ncan hardly be due to uric acid, as the contents of the upper part of the\r\nintestine were often acid.  In one case the contents of the gizzard were\r\nslightly acid, those of the upper intestines being more plainly acid.  In\r\nanother case the contents of the pharynx were not acid, those of the\r\ngizzard doubtfully so, while those of the intestine were distinctly acid\r\nat a distance of 5 cm. below the gizzard.  Even with the higher\r\nherbivorous and omnivorous animals, the contents of the large intestine\r\nare acid.  “This, however, is not caused by any acid secretion from the\r\nmucous membrane; the reaction of the intestinal walls in the larger as in\r\nthe small intestine is alkaline.  It must therefore arise from acid\r\nfermentations going on in the contents themselves . . .  In Carnivora the\r\ncontents of the coecum are said to be alkaline, and naturally the amount\r\nof fermentation will depend largely on the nature of the food.” {49}\r\n\r\nWith worms not only the contents of the intestines, but their ejected\r\nmatter or the castings, are generally acid.  Thirty castings from\r\ndifferent places were tested, and with three or four exceptions were\r\nfound to be acid; and the exceptions may have been due to such castings\r\nnot having been recently ejected; for some which were at first acid, were\r\non the following morning, after being dried and again moistened, no\r\nlonger acid; and this probably resulted from the humus acids being, as is\r\nknown to be the case, easily decomposed.  Five fresh castings from worms\r\nwhich lived in mould close over the chalk, were of a whitish colour and\r\nabounded with calcareous matter; and these were not in the least acid.\r\nThis shows how effectually carbonate of lime neutralises the intestinal\r\nacids.  When worms were kept in pots filled with fine ferruginous sand,\r\nit was manifest that the oxide of iron, with which the grains of silex\r\nwere coated, had been dissolved and removed from them in the castings.\r\n\r\nThe digestive fluid of worms resembles in its action, as already stated,\r\nthe pancreatic secretion of the higher animals; and in these latter,\r\n“pancreatic digestion is essentially alkaline; the action will not take\r\nplace unless some alkali be present; and the activity of an alkaline\r\njuice is arrested by acidification, and hindered by neutralization.” {50}\r\nTherefore it seems highly probable that the innumerable calciferous\r\ncells, which are poured from the four posterior glands into the\r\nalimentary canal of worms, serve to neutralise more or less completely\r\nthe acids there generated by the half-decayed leaves.  We have seen that\r\nthese cells are instantly dissolved by a small quantity of acetic acid,\r\nand as they do not always suffice to neutralise the contents of even the\r\nupper part of the alimentary canal, the lime is perhaps aggregated into\r\nconcretions in the anterior pair of glands, in order that some may be\r\ncarried down to the posterior parts of the intestine, where these\r\nconcretions would be rolled about amongst the acid contents.  The\r\nconcretions found in the intestines and in the castings often have a worn\r\nappearance, but whether this is due to some amount of attrition or of\r\nchemical corrosion could not be told.  Claparède believes that they are\r\nformed for the sake of acting as mill-stones, and of thus aiding in the\r\ntrituration of the food.  They may give some aid in this way; but I fully\r\nagree with Perrier that this must be of quite subordinate importance,\r\nseeing that the object is already attained by stones being generally\r\npresent in the gizzards and intestines of worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nHABITS OF WORMS—_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\nManner in which worms seize objects—Their power of suction—The instinct\r\nof plugging up the mouths of their burrows—Stones piled over the\r\nburrows—The advantages thus gained—Intelligence shown by worms in their\r\nmanner of plugging up their burrows—Various kinds of leaves and other\r\nobjects thus used—Triangles of paper—Summary of reasons for believing\r\nthat worms exhibit some intelligence—Means by which they excavate their\r\nburrows, by pushing away the earth and swallowing it—Earth also swallowed\r\nfor the nutritious matter which it contains—Depth to which worms burrow,\r\nand the construction of their burrows—Burrows lined with castings, and in\r\nthe upper part with leaves—The lowest part paved with little stones or\r\nseeds—Manner in which the castings are ejected—The collapse of old\r\nburrows—Distribution of worms—Tower-like castings in Bengal—Gigantic\r\ncastings on the Nilgiri Mountains—Castings ejected in all countries.\r\n\r\nIN the pots in which worms were kept, leaves were pinned down to the\r\nsoil, and at night the manner in which they were seized could be\r\nobserved.  The worms always endeavoured to drag the leaves towards their\r\nburrows; and they tore or sucked off small fragments, whenever the leaves\r\nwere sufficiently tender.  They generally seized the thin edge of a leaf\r\nwith their mouths, between the projecting upper and lower lip; the thick\r\nand strong pharynx being at the same time, as Perrier remarks, pushed\r\nforward within their bodies, so as to afford a point of resistance for\r\nthe upper lip.  In the case of broad flat objects they acted in a wholly\r\ndifferent manner.  The pointed anterior extremity of the body, after\r\nbeing brought into contact with an object of this kind, was drawn within\r\nthe adjoining rings, so that it appeared truncated and became as thick as\r\nthe rest of the body.  This part could then be seen to swell a little;\r\nand this, I believe, is due to the pharynx being pushed a little\r\nforwards.  Then by a slight withdrawal of the pharynx or by its\r\nexpansion, a vacuum was produced beneath the truncated slimy end of the\r\nbody whilst in contact with the object; and by this means the two adhered\r\nfirmly together. {53}  That under these circumstances a vacuum was\r\nproduced was plainly seen on one occasion, when a large worm lying\r\nbeneath a flaccid cabbage leaf tried to drag it away; for the surface of\r\nthe leaf directly over the end of the worm’s body became deeply pitted.\r\nOn another occasion a worm suddenly lost its hold on a flat leaf; and the\r\nanterior end of the body was momentarily seen to be cup-formed.  Worms\r\ncan attach themselves to an object beneath water in the same manner; and\r\nI saw one thus dragging away a submerged slice of an onion-bulb.\r\n\r\nThe edges of fresh or nearly fresh leaves affixed to the ground were\r\noften nibbled by the worms; and sometimes the epidermis and all the\r\nparenchyma on one side was gnawed completely away over a considerable\r\nspace; the epidermis alone on the opposite side being left quite clean.\r\nThe veins were never touched, and leaves were thus sometimes partly\r\nconverted into skeletons.  As worms have no teeth and as their mouths\r\nconsist of very soft tissue, it may be presumed that they consume by\r\nmeans of suction the edges and the parenchyma of fresh leaves, after they\r\nhave been softened by the digestive fluid.  They cannot attack such\r\nstrong leaves as those of sea-kale or large and thick leaves of ivy;\r\nthough one of the latter after it had become rotten was reduced in parts\r\nto the state of a skeleton.\r\n\r\nWorms seize leaves and other objects, not only to serve as food, but for\r\nplugging up the mouths of their burrows; and this is one of their\r\nstrongest instincts.  They sometimes work so energetically that Mr. D. F.\r\nSimpson, who has a small walled garden where worms abound in Bayswater,\r\ninforms me that on a calm damp evening he there heard so extraordinary a\r\nrustling noise from under a tree from which many leaves had fallen, that\r\nhe went out with a light and discovered that the noise was caused by many\r\nworms dragging the dry leaves and squeezing them into the burrows.  Not\r\nonly leaves, but petioles of many kinds, some flower-peduncles, often\r\ndecayed twigs of trees, bits of paper, feathers, tufts of wool and\r\nhorse-hairs are dragged into their burrows for this purpose.  I have seen\r\nas many as seventeen petioles of a Clematis projecting from the mouth of\r\none burrow, and ten from the mouth of another.  Some of these objects,\r\nsuch as the petioles just named, feathers, &c., are never gnawed by\r\nworms.  In a gravel-walk in my garden I found many hundred leaves of a\r\npine-tree (_P. austriaca_ or _nigricans_) drawn by their bases into\r\nburrows.  The surfaces by which these leaves are articulated to the\r\nbranches are shaped in as peculiar a manner as is the joint between the\r\nleg-bones of a quadruped; and if these surfaces had been in the least\r\ngnawed, the fact would have been immediately visible, but there was no\r\ntrace of gnawing.  Of ordinary dicotyledonous leaves, all those which are\r\ndragged into burrows are not gnawed.  I have seen as many as nine leaves\r\nof the lime-tree drawn into the same burrow, and not nearly all of them\r\nhad been gnawed; but such leaves may serve as a store for future\r\nconsumption.  Where fallen leaves are abundant, many more are sometimes\r\ncollected over the mouth of a burrow than can be used, so that a small\r\npile of unused leaves is left like a roof over those which have been\r\npartly dragged in.\r\n\r\nA leaf in being dragged a little way into a cylindrical burrow is\r\nnecessarily much folded or crumpled.  When another leaf is drawn in, this\r\nis done exteriorly to the first one, and so on with the succeeding\r\nleaves; and finally all become closely folded and pressed together.\r\nSometimes the worm enlarges the mouth of its burrow, or makes a fresh one\r\nclose by, so as to draw in a still larger number of leaves.  They often\r\nor generally fill up the interstices between the drawn-in leaves with\r\nmoist viscid earth ejected from their bodies; and thus the mouths of the\r\nburrows are securely plugged.  Hundreds of such plugged burrows may be\r\nseen in many places, especially during the autumnal and early winter\r\nmonths.  But, as will hereafter be shown, leaves are dragged into the\r\nburrows not only for plugging them up and for food, but for the sake of\r\nlining the upper part or mouth.\r\n\r\nWhen worms cannot obtain leaves, petioles, sticks, &c., with which to\r\nplug up the mouths of their burrows, they often protect them by little\r\nheaps of stones; and such heaps of smooth rounded pebbles may frequently\r\nbe seen on gravel-walks.  Here there can be no question about food.  A\r\nlady, who was interested in the habits of worms, removed the little heaps\r\nof stones from the mouths of several burrows and cleared the surface of\r\nthe ground for some inches all round.  She went out on the following\r\nnight with a lantern, and saw the worms with their tails fixed in their\r\nburrows, dragging the stones inwards by the aid of their mouths, no doubt\r\nby suction.  “After two nights some of the holes had 8 or 9 small stones\r\nover them; after four nights one had about 30, and another 34 stones.”\r\n{58}  One stone—which had been dragged over the gravel-walk to the mouth\r\nof a burrow weighed two ounces; and this proves how strong worms are.\r\nBut they show greater strength in sometimes displacing stones in a\r\nwell-trodden gravel-walk; that they do so, may be inferred from the\r\ncavities left by the displaced stones being exactly filled by those lying\r\nover the mouths of adjoining burrows, as I have myself observed.\r\n\r\nWork of this kind is usually performed during the night; but I have\r\noccasionally known objects to be drawn into the burrows during the day.\r\nWhat advantage the worms derive from plugging up the mouths of their\r\nburrows with leaves, &c., or from piling stones over them, is doubtful.\r\nThey do not act in this manner at the times when they eject much earth\r\nfrom their burrows; for their castings then serve to cover the mouths.\r\nWhen gardeners wish to kill worms on a lawn, it is necessary first to\r\nbrush or rake away the castings from the surface, in order that the\r\nlime-water may enter the burrows. {59a}  It might be inferred from this\r\nfact that the mouths are plugged up with leaves, &c., to prevent the\r\nentrance of water during heavy rain; but it may be urged against this\r\nview that a few, loose, well-rounded stones are ill-adapted to keep out\r\nwater.  I have moreover seen many burrows in the perpendicularly cut\r\nturf-edgings to gravel-walks, into which water could hardly flow, as well\r\nplugged as burrows on a level surface.  It is not probable that the plugs\r\nor piles of stones serve to conceal the burrows from scolopendras, which,\r\naccording to Hoffmeister, {59b} are the bitterest enemies of worms, or\r\nfrom the larger species of Carabus and Staphylinus which attack them\r\nferociously, for these animals are nocturnal, and the burrows are opened\r\nat night.  May not worms when the mouth of the burrow is protected be\r\nable to remain with safety with their heads close to it, which we know\r\nthat they like to do, but which costs so many of them their lives?  Or\r\nmay not the plugs check the free ingress of the lowest stratum of air,\r\nwhen chilled by radiation at night, from the surrounding ground and\r\nherbage?  I am inclined to believe in this latter view: firstly, because\r\nwhen worms were kept in pots in a room with a fire, in which case cold\r\nair could not enter the burrows, they plugged them up in a slovenly\r\nmanner; and secondarily, because they often coat the upper part of their\r\nburrows with leaves, apparently to prevent their bodies from coming into\r\nclose contact with the cold damp earth.  Mr. E. Parfitt has suggested to\r\nme that the mouths of the burrows are closed in order that the air within\r\nthem may be kept thoroughly damp, and this seems the most probable\r\nexplanation of the habit.  But the plugging-up process may serve for all\r\nthe above purposes.\r\n\r\nWhatever the motive may be, it appears that worms much dislike leaving\r\nthe mouths of their burrows open.  Nevertheless they will reopen them at\r\nnight, whether or not they can afterwards close them.  Numerous open\r\nburrows may be seen on recently-dug ground, for in this case the worms\r\neject their castings in cavities left in the ground, or in the old\r\nburrows instead of piling them over the mouths of their burrows, and they\r\ncannot collect objects on the surface by which the mouths might be\r\nprotected.  So again on a recently disinterred pavement of a Roman villa\r\nat Abinger (hereafter to be described) the worms pertinaciously opened\r\ntheir burrows almost every night, when these had been closed by being\r\ntrampled on, although they were rarely able to find a few minute stones\r\nwherewith to protect them.\r\n\r\n_Intelligence shown by worms in their manner of plugging up their\r\nburrows_.—If a man had to plug up a small cylindrical hole, with such\r\nobjects as leaves, petioles or twigs, he would drag or push them in by\r\ntheir pointed ends; but if these objects were very thin relatively to the\r\nsize of the hole, he would probably insert some by their thicker or\r\nbroader ends.  The guide in his case would be intelligence.  It seemed\r\ntherefore worth while to observe carefully how worms dragged leaves into\r\ntheir burrows; whether by their tips or bases or middle parts.  It seemed\r\nmore especially desirable to do this in the case of plants not natives to\r\nour country; for although the habit of dragging leaves into their burrows\r\nis undoubtedly instinctive with worms, yet instinct could not tell them\r\nhow to act in the case of leaves about which their progenitors knew\r\nnothing.  If, moreover, worms acted solely through instinct or an\r\nunvarying inherited impulse, they would draw all kinds of leaves into\r\ntheir burrows in the same manner.  If they have no such definite\r\ninstinct, we might expect that chance would determine whether the tip,\r\nbase or middle was seized.  If both these alternatives are excluded,\r\nintelligence alone is left; unless the worm in each case first tries many\r\ndifferent methods, and follows that alone which proves possible or the\r\nmost easy; but to act in this manner and to try different methods makes a\r\nnear approach to intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn the first place 227 withered leaves of various kinds, mostly of\r\nEnglish plants, were pulled out of worm-burrows in several places.  Of\r\nthese, 181 had been drawn into the burrows by or near their tips, so that\r\nthe foot-stalk projected nearly upright from the mouth of the burrow; 20\r\nhad been drawn in by their bases, and in this case the tips projected\r\nfrom the burrows; and 26 had been seized near the middle, so that these\r\nhad been drawn in transversely and were much crumpled.  Therefore 80 per\r\ncent. (always using the nearest whole number) had been drawn in by the\r\ntip, 9 per cent. by the base or foot-stalk, and 11 per cent. transversely\r\nor by the middle.  This alone is almost sufficient to show that chance\r\ndoes not determine the manner in which leaves are dragged into the\r\nburrows.\r\n\r\nOf the above 227 leaves, 70 consisted of the fallen leaves of the common\r\nlime-tree, which is almost certainly not a native of England.  These\r\nleaves are much acuminated towards the tip, and are very broad at the\r\nbase with a well-developed foot-stalk.  They are thin and quite flexible\r\nwhen half-withered.  Of the 70, 79 per cent. had been drawn in by or near\r\nthe tip; 4 per cent. by or near the base; and 17 per cent. transversely\r\nor by the middle.  These proportions agree very closely, as far as the\r\ntip is concerned, with those before given.  But the percentage drawn in\r\nby the base is smaller, which may be attributed to the breadth of the\r\nbasal part of the blade.  We here, also, see that the presence of a\r\nfoot-stalk, which it might have been expected would have tempted the\r\nworms as a convenient handle, has little or no influence in determining\r\nthe manner in which lime leaves are dragged into the burrows.  The\r\nconsiderable proportion, viz., 17 per cent., drawn in more or less\r\ntransversely depends no doubt on the flexibility of these half-decayed\r\nleaves.  The fact of so many having been drawn in by the middle, and of\r\nsome few having been drawn in by the base, renders it improbable that the\r\nworms first tried to draw in most of the leaves by one or both of these\r\nmethods, and that they afterwards drew in 79 per cent. by their tips; for\r\nit is clear that they would not have failed in drawing them in by the\r\nbase or middle.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of a foreign plant were next searched for, the blades of which\r\nwere not more pointed towards the apex than towards the base.  This\r\nproved to be the case with those of a laburnum (a hybrid between _Cytisus\r\nalpinus_ and _laburnum_) for on doubling the terminal over the basal\r\nhalf, they generally fitted exactly; and when there was any difference,\r\nthe basal half was a little the narrower.  It might, therefore, have been\r\nexpected that an almost equal number of these leaves would have been\r\ndrawn in by the tip and base, or a slight excess in favour of the latter.\r\nBut of 73 leaves (not included in the first lot of 227) pulled out of\r\nworm-burrows, 63 per cent. had been drawn in by the tip; 27 per cent. by\r\nthe base, and 10 per cent. transversely.  We here see that a far larger\r\nproportion, viz., 27 per cent. were drawn in by the base than in the case\r\nof lime leaves, the blades of which are very broad at the base, and of\r\nwhich only 4 per cent. had thus been drawn in.  We may perhaps account\r\nfor the fact of a still larger proportion of the laburnum leaves not\r\nhaving been drawn in by the base, by worms having acquired the habit of\r\ngenerally drawing in leaves by their tips and thus avoiding the\r\nfoot-stalk.  For the basal margin of the blade in many kinds of leaves\r\nforms a large angle with the foot-stalk; and if such a leaf were drawn in\r\nby the foot-stalk, the basal margin would come abruptly into contact with\r\nthe ground on each side of the burrow, and would render the drawing in of\r\nthe leaf very difficult.\r\n\r\nNevertheless worms break through their habit of avoiding the foot-stalk,\r\nif this part offers them the most convenient means for drawing leaves\r\ninto their burrows.  The leaves of the endless hybridised varieties of\r\nthe Rhododendron vary much in shape; some are narrowest towards the base\r\nand others towards the apex.  After they have fallen off, the blade on\r\neach side of the midrib often becomes curled up while drying, sometimes\r\nalong the whole length, sometimes chiefly at the base, sometimes towards\r\nthe apex.  Out of 28 fallen leaves on one bed of peat in my garden, no\r\nless than 23 were narrower in the basal quarter than in the terminal\r\nquarter of their length; and this narrowness was chiefly due to the\r\ncurling in of the margins.  Out of 36 fallen leaves on another bed, in\r\nwhich different varieties of the Rhododendron grew, only 17 were narrower\r\ntowards the base than towards the apex.  My son William, who first called\r\nmy attention to this case, picked up 237 fallen leaves in his garden\r\n(where the Rhododendron grows in the natural soil) and of these 65 per\r\ncent. could have been drawn by worms into their burrows more easily by\r\nthe base or foot-stalk than by the tip; and this was partly due to the\r\nshape of the leaf and in a less degree to the curling in of the margins:\r\n27 per cent. could have been drawn in more easily by the tip than by the\r\nbase: and 8 per cent. with about equal ease by either end.  The shape of\r\na fallen leaf ought to be judged of before one end has been drawn into a\r\nburrow, for after this has happened, the free end, whether it be the base\r\nor apex, will dry more quickly than the end imbedded in the damp ground;\r\nand the exposed margins of the free end will consequently tend to become\r\nmore curled inwards than they were when the leaf was first seized by the\r\nworm.  My son found 91 leaves which had been dragged by worms into their\r\nburrows, though not to a great depth; of these 66 per cent. had been\r\ndrawn in by the base or foot-stalk; and 34 per cent. by the tip.  In this\r\ncase, therefore, the worms judged with a considerable degree of\r\ncorrectness how best to draw the withered leaves of this foreign plant\r\ninto their burrows; notwithstanding that they had to depart from their\r\nusual habit of avoiding the foot-stalk.\r\n\r\nOn the gravel-walks in my garden a very large number of leaves of three\r\nspecies of Pinus (_P. austriaca_, _nigricans_ and _sylvestris_) are\r\nregularly drawn into the mouths of worm burrows.  These leaves consist of\r\ntwo so-called needles, which are of considerable length in the two first\r\nand short in the last named species, and are united to a common base; and\r\nit is by this part that they are almost invariably drawn into the\r\nburrows.  I have seen only two or at most three exceptions to this rule\r\nwith worms in a state of nature.  As the sharply pointed needles diverge\r\na little, and as several leaves are drawn into the same burrow, each tuft\r\nforms a perfect _chevaux de frise_.  On two occasions many of these tufts\r\nwere pulled up in the evening, but by the following morning fresh leaves\r\nhad been pulled in, and the burrows were again well protected.  These\r\nleaves could not be dragged into the burrows to any depth, except by\r\ntheir bases, as a worm cannot seize hold of the two needles at the same\r\ntime, and if one alone were seized by the apex, the other would be\r\npressed against the ground and would resist the entry of the seized one.\r\nThis was manifest in the above mentioned two or three exceptional cases.\r\nIn order, therefore, that worms should do their work well, they must drag\r\npine-leaves into their burrows by their bases, where the two needles are\r\nconjoined.  But how they are guided in this work is a perplexing\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty led my son Francis and myself to observe worms in\r\nconfinement during several nights by the aid of a dim light, while they\r\ndragged the leaves of the above named pines into their burrows.  They\r\nmoved the anterior extremities of their bodies about the leaves, and on\r\nseveral occasions when they touched the sharp end of a needle they\r\nwithdrew suddenly as if pricked.  But I doubt whether they were hurt, for\r\nthey are indifferent to very sharp objects, and will swallow even\r\nrose-thorns and small splinters of glass.  It may also be doubted,\r\nwhether the sharp ends of the needles serve to tell them that this is the\r\nwrong end to seize; for the points were cut off many leaves for a length\r\nof about one inch, and fifty-seven of them thus treated were drawn into\r\nthe burrows by their bases, and not one by the cut-off ends.  The worms\r\nin confinement often seized the needles near the middle and drew them\r\ntowards the mouths of their burrows; and one worm tried in a senseless\r\nmanner to drag them into the burrow by bending them.  They sometimes\r\ncollected many more leaves over the mouths of their burrows (as in the\r\ncase formerly mentioned of lime-leaves) than could enter them.  On other\r\noccasions, however, they behaved very differently; for as soon as they\r\ntouched the base of a pine-leaf, this was seized, being sometimes\r\ncompletely engulfed in their mouths, or a point very near the base was\r\nseized, and the leaf was then quickly dragged or rather jerked into their\r\nburrows.  It appeared both to my son and myself as if the worms instantly\r\nperceived as soon as they had seized a leaf in the proper manner.  Nine\r\nsuch cases were observed, but in one of them the worm failed to drag the\r\nleaf into its burrow, as it was entangled by other leaves lying near.  In\r\nanother case a leaf stood nearly upright with the points of the needles\r\npartly inserted into a burrow, but how placed there was not seen; and\r\nthen the worm reared itself up and seized the base, which was dragged\r\ninto the mouth of the burrow by bowing the whole leaf.  On the other\r\nhand, after a worm had seized the base of a leaf, this was on two\r\noccasions relinquished from some unknown motive.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, the habit of plugging up the mouths of the burrows\r\nwith various objects, is no doubt instinctive in worms; and a very young\r\none, born in one of my pots, dragged for some little distance a\r\nScotch-fir leaf, one needle of which was as long and almost as thick as\r\nits own body.  No species of pine is endemic in this part of England, it\r\nis therefore incredible that the proper manner of dragging pine-leaves\r\ninto the burrows can be instinctive with our worms.  But as the worms on\r\nwhich the above observations were made, were dug up beneath or near some\r\npines, which had been planted there about forty years, it was desirable\r\nto prove that their actions were not instinctive.  Accordingly,\r\npine-leaves were scattered on the ground in places far removed from any\r\npine-tree, and 90 of them were drawn into the burrows by their bases.\r\nOnly two were drawn in by the tips of the needles, and these were not\r\nreal exceptions, as one was drawn in for a very short distance, and the\r\ntwo needles of the other cohered.  Other pine-leaves were given to worms\r\nkept in pots in a warm room, and here the result was different; for out\r\nof 42 leaves drawn into the burrows, no less than 16 were drawn in by the\r\ntips of the needles.  These worms, however, worked in a careless or\r\nslovenly manner; for the leaves were often drawn in to only a small\r\ndepth; sometimes they were merely heaped over the mouths of the burrows,\r\nand sometimes none were drawn in.  I believe that this carelessness may\r\nbe accounted for either by the warmth of the air, or by its dampness, as\r\nthe pots were covered by glass plates; the worms consequently did not\r\ncare about plugging up their holes effectually.  Pots tenanted by worms\r\nand covered with a net which allowed the free entrance of air, were left\r\nout of doors for several nights, and now 72 leaves were all properly\r\ndrawn in by their bases.\r\n\r\nIt might perhaps be inferred from the facts as yet given, that worms\r\nsomehow gain a general notion of the shape or structure of pine-leaves,\r\nand perceive that it is necessary for them to seize the base where the\r\ntwo needles are conjoined.  But the following cases make this more than\r\ndoubtful.  The tips of a large number of needles of _P. austriaca_ were\r\ncemented together with shell-lac dissolved in alcohol, and were kept for\r\nsome days, until, as I believe, all odour or taste had been lost; and\r\nthey were then scattered on the ground where no pine-trees grew, near\r\nburrows from which the plugging had been removed.  Such leaves could have\r\nbeen drawn into the burrows with equal ease by either end; and judging\r\nfrom analogy and more especially from the case presently to be given of\r\nthe petioles of _Clematis montana_, I expected that the apex would have\r\nbeen preferred.  But the result was that out of 121 leaves with the tips\r\ncemented, which were drawn into burrows, 108 were drawn in by their\r\nbases, and only 13 by their tips.  Thinking that the worms might possibly\r\nperceive and dislike the smell or taste of the shell-lac, though this was\r\nvery improbable, especially after the leaves had been left out during\r\nseveral nights, the tips of the needles of many leaves were tied together\r\nwith fine thread.  Of leaves thus treated 150 were drawn into burrows—123\r\nby the base and 27 by the tied tips; so that between four and five times\r\nas many were drawn in by the base as by the tip.  It is possible that the\r\nshort cut-off ends of the thread with which they were tied, may have\r\ntempted the worms to drag in a larger proportional number by the tips\r\nthan when cement was used.  Of the leaves with tied and cemented tips\r\ntaken together (271 in number) 85 per cent. were drawn in by the base and\r\n15 per cent. by the tips.  We may therefore infer that it is not the\r\ndivergence of the two needles which leads worms in a state of nature\r\nalmost invariably to drag pine-leaves into their burrows by the base.\r\nNor can it be the sharpness of the points of the needles which determines\r\nthem; for, as we have seen, many leaves with the points cut off were\r\ndrawn in by their bases.  We are thus led to conclude, that with\r\npine-leaves there must be something attractive to worms in the base,\r\nnotwithstanding that few ordinary leaves are drawn in by the base or\r\nfoot-stalk.\r\n\r\n_Petioles_.—We will now turn to the petioles or foot-stalks of compound\r\nleaves, after the leaflets have fallen off.  Those from _Clematis\r\nmontana_, which grew over a verandah, were dragged early in January in\r\nlarge numbers into the burrows on an adjoining gravel-walk, lawn, and\r\nflower-bed.  These petioles vary from 2½ to 4½ inches in length, are\r\nrigid and of nearly uniform thickness, except close to the base where\r\nthey thicken rather abruptly, being here about twice as thick as in any\r\nother part.  The apex is somewhat pointed, but soon withers and is then\r\neasily broken off.  Of these petioles, 314 were pulled out of burrows in\r\nthe above specified sites; and it was found that 76 per cent. had been\r\ndrawn in by their tips, and 24 per cent by their bases; so that those\r\ndrawn in by the tip were a little more than thrice as many as those drawn\r\nin by the base.  Some of those extracted from the well-beaten gravel-walk\r\nwere kept separate from the others; and of these (59 in number) nearly\r\nfive times as many had been drawn in by the tip as by the base; whereas\r\nof those extracted from the lawn and flower-bed, where from the soil\r\nyielding more easily, less care would be necessary in plugging up the\r\nburrows, the proportion of those drawn in by the tip (130) to those drawn\r\nin by the base (48) was rather less than three to one.  That these\r\npetioles had been dragged into the burrows for plugging them up, and not\r\nfor food, was manifest, as neither end, as far as I could see, had been\r\ngnawed.  As several petioles are used to plug up the same burrow, in one\r\ncase as many as 10, and in another case as many as 15, the worms may\r\nperhaps at first draw in a few by the thicker end so as to save labour;\r\nbut afterwards a large majority are drawn in by the pointed end, in order\r\nto plug up the hole securely.\r\n\r\nThe fallen petioles of our native ash-tree were next observed, and the\r\nrule with most objects, viz., that a large majority are dragged into the\r\nburrows by the more pointed end, had not here been followed; and this\r\nfact much surprised me at first.  These petioles vary in length from 5 to\r\n8½ inches; they are thick and fleshy towards the base, whence they taper\r\ngently towards the apex, which is a little enlarged and truncated where\r\nthe terminal leaflet had been originally attached.  Under some ash-trees\r\ngrowing in a grass-field, 229 petioles were pulled out of worm burrows\r\nearly in January, and of these 51.5 per cent. had been drawn in by the\r\nbase, and 48.5 per cent. by the apex.  This anomaly was however readily\r\nexplained as soon as the thick basal part was examined; for in 78 out of\r\n103 petioles, this part had been gnawed by worms, just above the\r\nhorse-shoe shaped articulation.  In most cases there could be no mistake\r\nabout the gnawing; for ungnawed petioles which were examined after being\r\nexposed to the weather for eight additional weeks had not become more\r\ndisintegrated or decayed near the base than elsewhere.  It is thus\r\nevident that the thick basal end of the petiole is drawn in not solely\r\nfor the sake of plugging up the mouths of the burrows, but as food.  Even\r\nthe narrow truncated tips of some few petioles had been gnawed; and this\r\nwas the case in 6 out of 37 which were examined for this purpose.  Worms,\r\nafter having drawn in and gnawed the basal end, often push the petioles\r\nout of their burrows; and then drag in fresh ones, either by the base for\r\nfood, or by the apex for plugging up the mouth more effectually.  Thus,\r\nout of 37 petioles inserted by their tips, 5 had been previously drawn in\r\nby the base, for this part had been gnawed.  Again, I collected a handful\r\nof petioles lying loose on the ground close to some plugged-up burrows,\r\nwhere the surface was thickly strewed with other petioles which\r\napparently had never been touched by worms; and 14 out of 47 (_i.e._\r\nnearly one-third), after having had their bases gnawed had been pushed\r\nout of the burrows and were now lying on the ground.  From these several\r\nfacts we may conclude that worms draw in some petioles of the ash by the\r\nbase to serve as food, and others by the tip to plug up the mouths of\r\ntheir burrows in the most efficient manner.\r\n\r\nThe petioles of _Robinia pseudo-acacia_ vary from 4 or 5 to nearly 12\r\ninches in length; they are thick close to the base before the softer\r\nparts have rotted off, and taper much towards the upper end.  They are so\r\nflexible that I have seen some few doubled up and thus drawn into the\r\nburrows of worms.  Unfortunately these petioles were not examined until\r\nFebruary, by which time the softer parts had completely rotted off, so\r\nthat it was impossible to ascertain whether worms had gnawed the bases,\r\nthough this is in itself probable.  Out of 121 petioles extracted from\r\nburrows early in February, 68 were imbedded by the base, and 53 by the\r\napex.  On February 5 all the petioles which had been drawn into the\r\nburrows beneath a Robinia, were pulled up; and after an interval of\r\neleven days, 35 petioles had been again dragged in, 19 by the base, and\r\n16 by the apex.  Taking these two lots together, 56 per cent. were drawn\r\nin by the base, and 44 per cent. by the apex.  As all the softer parts\r\nhad long ago rotted off, we may feel sure, especially in the latter case,\r\nthat none had been drawn in as food.  At this season, therefore, worms\r\ndrag these petioles into their burrows indifferently by either end, a\r\nslight preference being given to the base.  This latter fact may be\r\naccounted for by the difficulty of plugging up a burrow with objects so\r\nextremely thin as are the upper ends.  In support of this view, it may be\r\nstated that out of the 16 petioles which had been drawn in by their upper\r\nends, the more attenuated terminal portion of 7 had been previously\r\nbroken off by some accident.\r\n\r\n_Triangles of paper_.—Elongated triangles were cut out of moderately\r\nstiff writing-paper, which was rubbed with raw fat on both sides, so as\r\nto prevent their becoming excessively limp when exposed at night to rain\r\nand dew.  The sides of all the triangles were three inches in length,\r\nwith the bases of 120 one inch, and of the other 183 half an inch in\r\nlength.  These latter triangles were very narrow or much acuminated. {79}\r\nAs a check on the observations presently to be given, similar triangles\r\nin a damp state were seized by a very narrow pair of pincers at different\r\npoints and at all inclinations with reference to the margins, and were\r\nthen drawn into a short tube of the diameter of a worm-burrow.  If seized\r\nby the apex, the triangle was drawn straight into the tube, with its\r\nmargins infolded; if seized at some little distance from the apex, for\r\ninstance at half an inch, this much was doubled back within the tube.  So\r\nit was with the base and basal angles, though in this case the triangles\r\noffered, as might have been expected, much more resistance to being drawn\r\nin.  If seized near the middle the triangle was doubled up, with the apex\r\nand base left sticking out of the tube.  As the sides of the triangles\r\nwere three inches in length, the result of their being drawn into a tube\r\nor into a burrow in different ways, may be conveniently divided into\r\nthree groups: those drawn in by the apex or within an inch of it; those\r\ndrawn in by the base or within an inch of it; and those drawn in by any\r\npoint in the middle inch.\r\n\r\nIn order to see how the triangles would be seized by worms, some in a\r\ndamp state were given to worms kept in confinement.  They were seized in\r\nthree different manners in the case of both the narrow and broad\r\ntriangles: viz., by the margin; by one of the three angles, which was\r\noften completely engulfed in their mouths; and lastly, by suction applied\r\nto any part of the flat surface.  If lines parallel to the base and an\r\ninch apart, are drawn across a triangle with the sides three inches in\r\nlength, it will be divided into three parts of equal length.  Now if\r\nworms seized indifferently by chance any part, they would assuredly seize\r\non the basal part or division far oftener than on either of the two other\r\ndivisions.  For the area of the basal to the apical part is as 5 to 1, so\r\nthat the chance of the former being drawn into a burrow by suction, will\r\nbe as 5 to 1, compared with the apical part.  The base offers two angles\r\nand the apex only one, so that the former would have twice as good a\r\nchance (independently of the size of the angles) of being engulfed in a\r\nworm’s mouth, as would the apex.  It should, however, be stated that the\r\napical angle is not often seized by worms; the margin at a little\r\ndistance on either side being preferred.  I judge of this from having\r\nfound in 40 out of 46 cases in which triangles had been drawn into\r\nburrows by their apical ends, that the tip had been doubled back within\r\nthe burrow for a length of between 1/20 of an inch and 1 inch.  Lastly,\r\nthe proportion between the margins of the basal and apical parts is as 3\r\nto 2 for the broad, and 2½ to 2 for the narrow triangles.  From these\r\nseveral considerations it might certainly have been expected, supposing\r\nthat worms seized hold of the triangles by chance, that a considerably\r\nlarger proportion would have been dragged into the burrows by the basal\r\nthan by the apical part; but we shall immediately see how different was\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nTriangles of the above specified sizes were scattered on the ground in\r\nmany places and on many successive nights near worm-burrows, from which\r\nthe leaves, petioles, twigs, &c., with which they had been plugged, were\r\nremoved.  Altogether 303 triangles were drawn by worms into their\r\nburrows: 12 others were drawn in by both ends, but as it was impossible\r\nto judge by which end they had been first seized, these are excluded.  Of\r\nthe 303, 62 per cent. had been drawn in by the apex (using this term for\r\nall drawn in by the apical part, one inch in length); 15 per cent. by the\r\nmiddle; and 23 per cent. by the basal part.  If they had been drawn\r\nindifferently by any point, the proportion for the apical, middle and\r\nbasal parts would have been 33.3 per cent. for each; but, as we have just\r\nseen, it might have been expected that a much larger proportion would\r\nhave been drawn in by the basal than by any other part.  As the case\r\nstands, nearly three times as many were drawn in by the apex as by the\r\nbase.  If we consider the broad triangles by themselves, 59 per cent.\r\nwere drawn in by the apex, 25 per cent. by the middle, and 16 per cent.\r\nby the base.  Of the narrow triangles, 65 per cent. were drawn in by the\r\napex, 14 per cent, by the middle, and 21 per cent. by the base; so that\r\nhere those drawn in by the apex were more than 3 times as many as those\r\ndrawn in by the base.  We may therefore conclude that the manner in which\r\nthe triangles are drawn into the burrows is not a matter of chance.\r\n\r\nIn eight cases, two triangles had been drawn into the same burrow, and in\r\nseven of these cases, one had been drawn in by the apex and the other by\r\nthe base.  This again indicates that the result is not determined by\r\nchance.  Worms appear sometimes to revolve in the act of drawing in the\r\ntriangles, for five out of the whole lot had been wound into an irregular\r\nspire round the inside of the burrow.  Worms kept in a warm room drew 63\r\ntriangles into their burrows; but, as in the case of the pine-leaves,\r\nthey worked in a rather careless manner, for only 44 per cent. were drawn\r\nin by the apex, 22 per cent. by the middle, and 33 per cent. by the base.\r\nIn five cases, two triangles were drawn into the same burrow.\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested with much apparent probability that so large a\r\nproportion of the triangles were drawn in by the apex, not from the worms\r\nhaving selected this end as the most convenient for the purpose, but from\r\nhaving first tried in other ways and failed.  This notion was\r\ncountenanced by the manner in which worms in confinement were seen to\r\ndrag about and drop the triangles; but then they were working carelessly.\r\nI did not at first perceive the importance of this subject, but merely\r\nnoticed that the bases of those triangles which had been drawn in by the\r\napex, were generally clean and not crumpled.  The subject was afterwards\r\nattended to carefully.  In the first place several triangles which had\r\nbeen drawn in by the basal angles, or by the base, or a little above the\r\nbase, and which were thus much crumpled and dirtied, were left for some\r\nhours in water and were then well shaken while immersed; but neither the\r\ndirt nor the creases were thus removed.  Only slight creases could be\r\nobliterated, even by pulling the wet triangles several times through my\r\nfingers.  Owing to the slime from the worms’ bodies, the dirt was not\r\neasily washed off.  We may therefore conclude that if a triangle, before\r\nbeing dragged in by the apex, had been dragged into a burrow by its base\r\nwith even a slight degree of force, the basal part would long retain its\r\ncreases and remain dirty.  The condition of 89 triangles (65 narrow and\r\n24 broad ones), which had been drawn in by the apex, was observed; and\r\nthe bases of only 7 of them were at all creased, being at the same time\r\ngenerally dirty.  Of the 82 uncreased triangles, 14 were dirty at the\r\nbase; but it does not follow from this fact that these had first been\r\ndragged towards the burrows by their bases; for the worms sometimes\r\ncovered large portions of the triangles with slime, and these when\r\ndragged by the apex over the ground would be dirtied; and during rainy\r\nweather, the triangles were often dirtied over one whole side or over\r\nboth sides.  If the worms had dragged the triangles to the mouths of\r\ntheir burrows by their bases, as often as by their apices, and had then\r\nperceived, without actually trying to draw them into the burrow, that the\r\nbroader end was not well adapted for this purpose—even in this case a\r\nlarge proportion would probably have had their basal ends dirtied.  We\r\nmay therefore infer—improbable as is the inference—that worms are able by\r\nsome means to judge which is the best end by which to draw triangles of\r\npaper into their burrows.\r\n\r\nThe percentage results of the foregoing observations on the manner in\r\nwhich worms draw various kinds of objects into the mouths of their\r\nburrows may be abridged as follows:—\r\n\r\n   Nature of       Drawn into the   Drawn in, by or   Drawn in, by or\r\n    Object.        burrows, by or       near the       near the base.\r\n                   near the apex.       middle.\r\nLeaves of                       80                11                 9\r\nvarious kinds\r\n—of the Lime,                   79                17                 4\r\nbasal margin of\r\nblade broad,\r\napex acuminated\r\n—of a Laburnum,                 63                10                27\r\nbasal part of\r\nblade as narrow\r\nas, or\r\nsometimes\r\nlittle narrower\r\nthan the apical\r\npart\r\n—of the                         34        ...                       66\r\nRhododendron,\r\nbasal part of\r\nblade often\r\nnarrower than\r\nthe apical part\r\n—of Pine-trees,         ...               ...                      100\r\nconsisting of\r\ntwo needles\r\narising from a\r\ncommon base\r\nPetioles of a                   76        ...                       24\r\nClematis,\r\nsomewhat\r\npointed at the\r\napex, and blunt\r\nat the base\r\n—of the Ash,                  48.5        ...                     51.5\r\nthe thick basal\r\nend often drawn\r\nin to serve as\r\nfood\r\n—of Robinia,                    44        ...                       56\r\nextremely thin,\r\nespecially\r\ntowards the\r\napex, so as to\r\nbe ill-fitted\r\nfor plugging up\r\nthe burrows\r\nTriangles of                    62                15                23\r\npaper, of the\r\ntwo sizes\r\n—of the broad                   59                25                16\r\nones alone\r\n—of the narrow                  65                14                21\r\nones alone\r\n\r\nIf we consider these several cases, we can hardly escape from the\r\nconclusion that worms show some degree of intelligence in their manner of\r\nplugging up their burrows.  Each particular object is seized in too\r\nuniform a manner, and from causes which we can generally understand, for\r\nthe result to be attributed to mere chance.  That every object has not\r\nbeen drawn in by its pointed end, may be accounted for by labour having\r\nbeen saved through some being inserted by their broader or thicker ends.\r\nNo doubt worms are led by instinct to plug up their burrows; and it might\r\nhave been expected that they would have been led by instinct how best to\r\nact in each particular case, independently of intelligence.  We see how\r\ndifficult it is to judge whether intelligence comes into play, for even\r\nplants might sometimes be thought to be thus directed; for instance when\r\ndisplaced leaves re-direct their upper surfaces towards the light by\r\nextremely complicated movements and by the shortest course.  With\r\nanimals, actions appearing due to intelligence may be performed through\r\ninherited habit without any intelligence, although aboriginally thus\r\nacquired.  Or the habit may have been acquired through the preservation\r\nand inheritance of beneficial variations of some other habit; and in this\r\ncase the new habit will have been acquired independently of intelligence\r\nthroughout the whole course of its development.  There is no _à priori_\r\nimprobability in worms having acquired special instincts through either\r\nof these two latter means.  Nevertheless it is incredible that instincts\r\nshould have been developed in reference to objects, such as the leaves of\r\npetioles of foreign plants, wholly unknown to the progenitors of the\r\nworms which act in the described manner.  Nor are their actions so\r\nunvarying or inevitable as are most true instincts.\r\n\r\nAs worms are not guided by special instincts in each particular case,\r\nthough possessing a general instinct to plug up their burrows, and as\r\nchance is excluded, the next most probable conclusion seems to be that\r\nthey try in many different ways to draw in objects, and at last succeed\r\nin some one way.  But it is surprising that an animal so low in the scale\r\nas a worm should have the capacity for acting in this manner, as many\r\nhigher animals have no such capacity.  For instance, ants may be seen\r\nvainly trying to drag an object transversely to their course, which could\r\nbe easily drawn longitudinally; though after a time they generally act in\r\na wiser manner, M. Fabre states {89a} that a Sphex—an insect belonging to\r\nthe same highly-endowed order with ants—stocks its nest with paralysed\r\ngrass-hoppers, which are invariably dragged into the burrow by their\r\nantennæ.  When these were cut off close to the head, the Sphex seized the\r\npalpi; but when these were likewise cut off, the attempt to drag its prey\r\ninto the burrow was given up in despair.  The Sphex had not intelligence\r\nenough to seize one of the six legs or the ovipositor of the grasshopper,\r\nwhich, as M. Fabre remarks, would have served equally well.  So again, if\r\nthe paralysed prey with an egg attached to it be taken out of the cell,\r\nthe Sphex after entering and finding the cell empty, nevertheless closes\r\nit up in the usual elaborate manner.  Bees will try to escape and go on\r\nbuzzing for hours on a window, one half of which has been left open.\r\nEven a pike continued during three months to dash and bruise itself\r\nagainst the glass sides of an aquarium, in the vain attempt to seize\r\nminnows on the opposite side. {89b}  A cobra-snake was seen by Mr. Layard\r\n{90} to act much more wisely than either the pike or the Sphex; it had\r\nswallowed a toad lying within a hole, and could not withdraw its head;\r\nthe toad was disgorged, and began to crawl away; it was again swallowed\r\nand again disgorged; and now the snake had learnt by experience, for it\r\nseized the toad by one of its legs and drew it out of the hole.  The\r\ninstincts of even the higher animals are often followed in a senseless or\r\npurposeless manner: the weaver-bird will perseveringly wind threads\r\nthrough the bars of its cage, as if building a nest: a squirrel will pat\r\nnuts on a wooden floor, as if he had just buried them in the ground: a\r\nbeaver will cut up logs of wood and drag them about, though there is no\r\nwater to dam up; and so in many other cases.\r\n\r\nMr. Romanes, who has specially studied the minds of animals, believes\r\nthat we can safely infer intelligence, only when we see an individual\r\nprofiting by its own experience.  By this test the cobra showed some\r\nintelligence; but this would have been much plainer if on a second\r\noccasion he had drawn a toad out of a hole by its leg.  The Sphex failed\r\nsignally in this respect.  Now if worms try to drag objects into their\r\nburrows first in one way and then in another, until they at last succeed,\r\nthey profit, at least in each particular instance, by experience.\r\n\r\nBut evidence has been advanced showing that worms do not habitually try\r\nto draw objects into their burrows in many different ways.  Thus\r\nhalf-decayed lime-leaves from their flexibility could have been drawn in\r\nby their middle or basal parts, and were thus drawn into the burrows in\r\nconsiderable numbers; yet a large majority were drawn in by or near the\r\napex.  The petioles of the Clematis could certainly have been drawn in\r\nwith equal ease by the base and apex; yet three times and in certain\r\ncases five times as many were drawn in by the apex as by the base.  It\r\nmight have been thought that the foot-stalks of leaves would have tempted\r\nthe worms as a convenient handle; yet they are not largely used, except\r\nwhen the base of the blade is narrower than the apex.  A large number of\r\nthe petioles of the ash are drawn in by the base; but this part serves\r\nthe worms as food.  In the case of pine-leaves worms plainly show that\r\nthey at least do not seize the leaf by chance; but their choice does not\r\nappear to be determined by the divergence of the two needles, and the\r\nconsequent advantage or necessity of drawing them into their burrows by\r\nthe base.  With respect to the triangles of paper, those which had been\r\ndrawn in by the apex rarely had their bases creased or dirty; and this\r\nshows that the worms had not often first tried to drag them in by this\r\nend.\r\n\r\nIf worms are able to judge, either before drawing or after having drawn\r\nan object close to the mouths of their burrows, how best to drag it in,\r\nthey must acquire some notion of its general shape.  This they probably\r\nacquire by touching it in many places with the anterior extremity of\r\ntheir bodies, which serves as a tactile organ.  It may be well to\r\nremember how perfect the sense of touch becomes in a man when born blind\r\nand deaf, as are worms.  If worms have the power of acquiring some\r\nnotion, however rude, of the shape of an object and of their burrows, as\r\nseems to be the case, they deserve to be called intelligent; for they\r\nthen act in nearly the same manner as would a man under similar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, as chance does not determine the manner in which objects are\r\ndrawn into the burrows, and as the existence of specialized instincts for\r\neach particular case cannot be admitted, the first and most natural\r\nsupposition is that worms try all methods until they at last succeed; but\r\nmany appearances are opposed to such a supposition.  One alternative\r\nalone is left, namely, that worms, although standing low in the scale of\r\norganization, possess some degree of intelligence.  This will strike\r\nevery one as very improbable; but it may be doubted whether we know\r\nenough about the nervous system of the lower animals to justify our\r\nnatural distrust of such a conclusion.  With respect to the small size of\r\nthe cerebral ganglia, we should remember what a mass of inherited\r\nknowledge, with some power of adapting means to an end, is crowded into\r\nthe minute brain of a worker-ant.\r\n\r\n_Means by which worms excavate their burrows_.—This is effected in two\r\nways; by pushing away the earth on all sides, and by swallowing it.  In\r\nthe former case, the worm inserts the stretched out and attenuated\r\nanterior extremity of its body into any little crevice, or hole; and\r\nthen, as Perrier remarks, {93} the pharynx is pushed forwards into this\r\npart, which consequently swells and pushes away the earth on all sides.\r\nThe anterior extremity thus serves as a wedge.  It also serves, as we\r\nhave before seen, for prehension and suction, and as a tactile organ.  A\r\nworm was placed on loose mould, and it buried itself in between two and\r\nthree minutes.  On another occasion four worms disappeared in 15 minutes\r\nbetween the sides of the pot and the earth, which had been moderately\r\npressed down.  On a third occasion three large worms and a small one were\r\nplaced on loose mould well mixed with fine sand and firmly pressed down,\r\nand they all disappeared, except the tail of one, in 35 minutes.  On a\r\nfourth occasion six large worms were placed on argillaceous mud mixed\r\nwith sand firmly pressed down, and they disappeared, except the extreme\r\ntips of the tails of two of them, in 40 minutes.  In none of these cases,\r\ndid the worms swallow, as far as could be seen, any earth.  They\r\ngenerally entered the ground close to the sides of the pot.\r\n\r\nA pot was next filled with very fine ferruginous sand, which was pressed\r\ndown, well watered, and thus rendered extremely compact.  A large worm\r\nleft on the surface did not succeed in penetrating it for some hours, and\r\ndid not bury itself completely until 25 hrs. 40 min. had elapsed.  This\r\nwas effected by the sand being swallowed, as was evident by the large\r\nquantity ejected from the vent, long before the whole body had\r\ndisappeared.  Castings of a similar nature continued to be ejected from\r\nthe burrow during the whole of the following day.\r\n\r\nAs doubts have been expressed by some writers whether worms ever swallow\r\nearth solely for the sake of making their burrows, some additional cases\r\nmay be given.  A mass of fine reddish sand, 23 inches in thickness, left\r\non the ground for nearly two years, had been penetrated in many places by\r\nworms; and their castings consisted partly of the reddish sand and partly\r\nof black earth brought up from beneath the mass.  This sand had been dug\r\nup from a considerable depth, and was of so poor a nature that weeds\r\ncould not grow on it.  It is therefore highly improbable that it should\r\nhave been swallowed by the worms as food.  Again in a field near my house\r\nthe castings frequently consist of almost pure chalk, which lies at only\r\na little depth beneath the surface; and here again it is very improbable\r\nthat the chalk should have been swallowed for the sake of the very little\r\norganic matter which could have percolated into it from the poor\r\noverlying pasture.  Lastly, a casting thrown up through the concrete and\r\ndecayed mortar between the tiles, with which the now ruined aisle of\r\nBeaulieu Abbey had formerly been paved, was washed, so that the coarser\r\nmatter alone was left.  This consisted of grains of quartz, micaceous\r\nslate, other rocks, and bricks or tiles, many of them from 1/20 to 1/10\r\ninch in diameter.  No one will suppose that these grains were swallowed\r\nas food, yet they formed more than half of the casting, for they weighed\r\n19 grains, the whole casting having weighed 33 grains.  Whenever a worm\r\nburrows to a depth of some feet in undisturbed compact ground, it must\r\nform its passage by swallowing the earth; for it is incredible that the\r\nground could yield on all sides to the pressure of the pharynx when\r\npushed forwards within the worm’s body.\r\n\r\nThat worms swallow a larger quantity of earth for the sake of extracting\r\nany nutritious matter which it may contain than for making their burrows,\r\nappears to me certain.  But as this old belief has been doubted by so\r\nhigh an authority as Claparède, evidence in its favour must be given in\r\nsome detail.  There is no _à priori_ improbability in such a belief, for\r\nbesides other annelids, especially the _Arenicola marina_, which throws\r\nup such a profusion of castings on our tidal sands, and which it is\r\nbelieved thus subsists, there are animals belonging to the most distinct\r\nclasses, which do not burrow, but habitually swallow large quantities of\r\nsand; namely, the molluscan Onchidium and many Echinoderms. {97}\r\n\r\nIf earth were swallowed only when worms deepened their burrows or made\r\nnew ones, castings would be thrown up only occasionally; but in many\r\nplaces fresh castings may be seen every morning, and the amount of earth\r\nejected from the same burrow on successive days is large.  Yet worms do\r\nnot burrow to a great depth, except when the weather is very dry or\r\nintensely cold.  On my lawn the black vegetable mould or humus is only\r\nabout 5 inches in thickness, and overlies light-coloured or reddish\r\nclayey soil: now when castings are thrown up in the greatest profusion,\r\nonly a small proportion are light coloured, and it is incredible that the\r\nworms should daily make fresh burrows in every direction in the thin\r\nsuperficial layer of dark-coloured mould, unless they obtained nutriment\r\nof some kind from it.  I have observed a strictly analogous case in a\r\nfield near my house where bright red clay lay close beneath the surface.\r\nAgain on one part of the Downs near Winchester the vegetable mould\r\noverlying the chalk was found to be only from 3 to 4 inches in thickness;\r\nand the many castings here ejected were as black as ink and did not\r\neffervesce with acids; so that the worms must have confined themselves to\r\nthis thin superficial layer of mould, of which large quantities were\r\ndaily swallowed.  In another place at no great distance the castings were\r\nwhite; and why the worms should have burrowed into the chalk in some\r\nplaces and not in others, I am unable to conjecture.\r\n\r\nTwo great piles of leaves had been left to decay in my grounds, and\r\nmonths after their removal, the bare surface, several yards in diameter,\r\nwas so thickly covered during several months with castings that they\r\nformed an almost continuous layer; and the large number of worms which\r\nlived here must have subsisted during these months on nutritious matter\r\ncontained in the black earth.\r\n\r\nThe lowest layer from another pile of decayed leaves mixed with some\r\nearth was examined under a high power, and the number of spores of\r\nvarious shapes and sizes which it contained was astonishingly great; and\r\nthese crushed in the gizzards of worms may largely aid in supporting\r\nthem.  Whenever castings are thrown up in the greatest number, few or no\r\nleaves are drawn into the burrows; for instance the turf along a\r\nhedgerow, about 200 yards in length, was daily observed in the autumn\r\nduring several weeks, and every morning many fresh castings were seen;\r\nbut not a single leaf was drawn into these burrows.  These castings from\r\ntheir blackness and from the nature of the subsoil could not have been\r\nbrought up from a greater depth than 6 or 8 inches.  On what could these\r\nworms have subsisted during this whole time, if not on matter contained\r\nin the black earth?  On the other hand, whenever a large number of leaves\r\nare drawn into the burrows, the worms seem to subsist chiefly on them,\r\nfor few earth-castings are then ejected on the surface.  This difference\r\nin the behaviour of worms at different times, perhaps explains a\r\nstatement by Claparède, namely, that triturated leaves and earth are\r\nalways found in distinct parts of their intestines.\r\n\r\nWorms sometimes abound in places where they can rarely or never obtain\r\ndead or living leaves; for instance, beneath the pavement in well-swept\r\ncourtyards, into which leaves are only occasionally blown.  My son Horace\r\nexamined a house, one corner of which had subsided; and he found here in\r\nthe cellar, which was extremely damp, many small worm-castings thrown up\r\nbetween the stones with which the cellar was paved; and in this case it\r\nis improbable that the worms could ever have obtained leaves.  Mr. A. C.\r\nHorner confirms this account, as he has seen castings in the cellars of\r\nhis house, which is an old one at Tonbridge.\r\n\r\nBut the best evidence, known to me, of worms subsisting for at least\r\nconsiderable periods of time solely on the organic matter contained in\r\nearth, is afforded by some facts communicated to me by Dr. King.  Near\r\nNice large castings abound in extraordinary numbers, so that 5 or 6 were\r\noften found within the space of a square foot.  They consist of fine,\r\npale-coloured earth, containing calcareous matter, which after having\r\npassed through the bodies of worms and being dried, coheres with\r\nconsiderable force.  I have reason to believe that these castings had\r\nbeen formed by species of Perichæta, which have been naturalized here\r\nfrom the East. {101}  They rise like towers, with their summits often a\r\nlittle broader than their bases, sometimes to a height of above 3 and\r\noften to a height of 2½ inches.  The tallest of those which were measured\r\nwas 3.3 inches in height and 1 inch in diameter.  A small cylindrical\r\npassage runs up the centre of each tower, through which the worm ascends\r\nto eject the earth which it has swallowed, and thus to add to its height.\r\nA structure of this kind would not allow leaves being easily dragged from\r\nthe surrounding ground into the burrows; and Dr. King, who looked\r\ncarefully, never saw even a fragment of a leaf thus drawn in.  Nor could\r\nany trace be discovered of the worms having crawled down the exterior\r\nsurfaces of the towers in search of leaves; and had they done so, tracks\r\nwould almost certainly have been left on the upper part whilst it\r\nremained soft.  It does not, however, follow that these worms do not draw\r\nleaves into their burrows during some other season of the year, at which\r\ntime they would not build up their towers.\r\n\r\nFrom the several foregoing cases, it can hardly be doubted that worms\r\nswallow earth, not only for the sake of making their burrows, but for\r\nobtaining food.  Hensen, however, concludes from his analyses of mould\r\nthat worms probably could not live on ordinary vegetable mould, though he\r\nadmits that they might be nourished to some extent by leaf-mould. {102}\r\nBut we have seen that worms eagerly devour raw meat, fat, and dead worms;\r\nand ordinary mould can hardly fail to contain many ova, larvæ, and small\r\nliving or dead creatures, spores of cryptogamic plants, and micrococci,\r\nsuch as those which give rise to saltpetre.  These various organisms,\r\ntogether with some cellulose from any leaves and roots not utterly\r\ndecayed, might well account for such large quantities of mould being\r\nswallowed by worms.  It may be worth while here to recall the fact that\r\ncertain species of Utricularia, which grow in damp places in the tropics,\r\npossess bladders beautifully constructed for catching minute subterranean\r\nanimals; and these traps would not have been developed unless many small\r\nanimals inhabited such soil.\r\n\r\n_The depth to which worms penetrate_, _and the construction of their\r\nburrows_.—Although worms usually live near the surface, yet they burrow\r\nto a considerable depth during long-continued dry weather and severe\r\ncold.  In Scandinavia, according to Eisen, and in Scotland, according to\r\nMr. Lindsay Carnagie, the burrows run down to a depth of from 7 to 8\r\nfeet; in North Germany, according to Hoffmeister, from 6 to 8 feet, but\r\nHensen says, from 3 to 6 feet.  This latter observer has seen worms\r\nfrozen at a depth of 1½ feet beneath the surface.  I have not myself had\r\nmany opportunities for observation, but I have often met with worms at\r\ndepths of 3 to 4 feet.  In a bed of fine sand overlying the chalk, which\r\nhad never been disturbed, a worm was cut into two at 55 inches, and\r\nanother was found here at Down in December at the bottom of its burrow,\r\nat 61 inches beneath the surface.  Lastly, in earth near an old Roman\r\nVilla, which had not been disturbed for many centuries, a worm was met\r\nwith at a depth of 66 inches; and this was in the middle of August.\r\n\r\nThe burrows run down perpendicularly, or more commonly a little\r\nobliquely.  They are said sometimes to branch, but as far as I have seen\r\nthis does not occur, except in recently dug ground and near the surface.\r\nThey are generally, or as I believe invariably, lined with a thin layer\r\nof fine, dark-coloured earth voided by the worms; so that they must at\r\nfirst be made a little wider than their ultimate diameter.  I have seen\r\nseveral burrows in undisturbed sand thus lined at a depth of 4 ft. 6 in.;\r\nand others close to the surface thus lined in recently dug ground.  The\r\nwalls of fresh burrows are often dotted with little globular pellets of\r\nvoided earth, still soft and viscid; and these, as it appears, are spread\r\nout on all sides by the worm as it travels up or down its burrow.  The\r\nlining thus formed becomes very compact and smooth when nearly dry, and\r\nclosely fits the worm’s body.  The minute reflexed bristles which project\r\nin rows on all sides from the body, thus have excellent points of\r\nsupport; and the burrow is rendered well adapted for the rapid movement\r\nof the animal.  The lining appears also to strengthen the walls, and\r\nperhaps saves the worm’s body from being scratched.  I think so because\r\nseveral burrows which passed through a layer of sifted coal-cinders,\r\nspread over turf to a thickness of 1½ inch, had been thus lined to an\r\nunusual thickness.  In this case the worms, judging from the castings,\r\nhad pushed the cinders away on all sides and had not swallowed any of\r\nthem.  In another place, burrows similarly lined, passed through a layer\r\nof coarse coal-cinders, 3½ inches in thickness.  We thus see that the\r\nburrows are not mere excavations, but may rather be compared with tunnels\r\nlined with cement.\r\n\r\nThe mouths of the burrow are in addition often lined with leaves; and\r\nthis is an instinct distinct from that of plugging them up, and does not\r\nappear to have been hitherto noticed.  Many leaves of the Scotch-fir or\r\npine (_Pinus sylvestris_) were given to worms kept in confinement in two\r\npots; and when after several weeks the earth was carefully broken up, the\r\nupper parts of three oblique burrows were found surrounded for lengths of\r\n7, 4, and 3½ inches with pine-leaves, together with fragments of other\r\nleaves which had been given the worms as food.  Glass beads and bits of\r\ntile, which had been strewed on the surface of the soil, were stuck into\r\nthe interstices between the pine-leaves; and these interstices were\r\nlikewise plastered with the viscid castings voided by the worms.  The\r\nstructures thus formed cohered so well, that I succeeded in removing one\r\nwith only a little earth adhering to it.  It consisted of a slightly\r\ncurved cylindrical case, the interior of which could be seen through\r\nholes in the sides and at either end.  The pine-leaves had all been drawn\r\nin by their bases; and the sharp points of the needles had been pressed\r\ninto the lining of voided earth.  Had this not been effectually done, the\r\nsharp points would have prevented the retreat of the worms into their\r\nburrows; and these structures would have resembled traps armed with\r\nconverging points of wire, rendering the ingress of an animal easy and\r\nits egress difficult or impossible.  The skill shown by these worms is\r\nnoteworthy and is the more remarkable, as the Scotch pine is not a native\r\nof this district.\r\n\r\nAfter having examined these burrows made by worms in confinement, I\r\nlooked at those in a flower-bed near some Scotch pines.  These had all\r\nbeen plugged up in the ordinary manner with the leaves of this tree,\r\ndrawn in for a length of from 1 to 1½ inch; but the mouths of many of\r\nthem were likewise lined with them, mingled with fragments of other kinds\r\nof leaves, drawn in to a depth of 4 or 5 inches.  Worms often remain, as\r\nformerly stated, for a long time close to the mouths of their burrows,\r\napparently for warmth; and the basket-like structures formed of leaves\r\nwould keep their bodies from coming into close contact with the cold damp\r\nearth.  That they habitually rested on the pine-leaves, was rendered\r\nprobable by their clean and almost polished surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe burrows which run far down into the ground, generally, or at least\r\noften, terminate in a little enlargement or chamber.  Here, according to\r\nHoffmeister, one or several worms pass the winter rolled up into a ball.\r\nMr. Lindsay Carnagie informed me (1838) that he had examined many burrows\r\nover a stone-quarry in Scotland, where the overlying boulder-clay and\r\nmould had recently been cleared away, and a little vertical cliff thus\r\nleft.  In several cases the same burrow was a little enlarged at two or\r\nthree points one beneath the other; and all the burrows terminated in a\r\nrather large chamber, at a depth of 7 or 8 feet from the surface.  These\r\nchambers contained many small sharp bits of stone and husks of\r\nflax-seeds.  They must also have contained living seeds, for on the\r\nfollowing spring Mr. Carnagie saw grass-plants sprouting out of some of\r\nthe intersected chambers.  I found at Abinger in Surrey two burrows\r\nterminating in similar chambers at a depth of 36 and 41 inches, and these\r\nwere lined or paved with little pebbles, about as large as mustard seeds;\r\nand in one of the chambers there was a decayed oat-grain, with its husk.\r\nHensen likewise states that the bottoms of the burrows are lined with\r\nlittle stones; and where these could not be procured, seeds, apparently\r\nof the pear, had been used, as many as fifteen having been carried down\r\ninto a single burrow, one of which had germinated. {108}  We thus see how\r\neasily a botanist might be deceived who wished to learn how long deeply\r\nburied seeds remained alive, if he were to collect earth from a\r\nconsiderable depth, on the supposition that it could contain only seeds\r\nwhich had long lain buried.  It is probable that the little stones, as\r\nwell as the seeds, are carried down from the surface by being swallowed;\r\nfor a surprising number of glass beads, bits of tile and of glass were\r\ncertainly thus carried down by worms kept in pots; but some may have been\r\ncarried down within their mouths.  The sole conjecture which I can form\r\nwhy worms line their winter-quarters with little stones and seeds, is to\r\nprevent their closely coiled-up bodies from coming into close contact\r\nwith the surrounding cold soil; and such contact would perhaps interfere\r\nwith their respiration which is effected by the skin alone.\r\n\r\nA worm after swallowing earth, whether for making its burrow or for food,\r\nsoon comes to the surface to empty its body.  The ejected earth is\r\nthoroughly mingled with the intestinal secretions, and is thus rendered\r\nviscid.  After being dried it sets hard.  I have watched worms during the\r\nact of ejection, and when the earth was in a very liquid state it was\r\nejected in little spurts, and by a slow peristaltic movement when not so\r\nliquid.  It is not cast indifferently on any side, but with some care,\r\nfirst on one and then on another side; the tail being used almost like a\r\ntrowel.  When a worm comes to the surface to eject earth, the tail\r\nprotrudes, but when it collects leaves its head must protrude.  Worms\r\ntherefore must have the power of turning round in their closely-fitting\r\nburrows; and this, as it appears to us, would be a difficult feat.  As\r\nsoon as a little heap has been formed, the worm apparently avoids, for\r\nthe sake of safety, protruding its tail; and the earthy matter is forced\r\nup through the previously deposited soft mass.  The mouth of the same\r\nburrow is used for this purpose for a considerable time.  In the case of\r\nthe tower-like castings (see Fig. 2) near Nice, and of the similar but\r\nstill taller towers from Bengal (hereafter to be described and figured),\r\na considerable degree of skill is exhibited in their construction.  Dr.\r\nKing also observed that the passage up these towers hardly ever ran in\r\nthe same exact line with the underlying burrow, so that a thin\r\ncylindrical object such as a haulm of grass, could not be passed down the\r\ntower into the burrow; and this change of direction probably serves in\r\nsome manner as a protection.\r\n\r\nWorms do not always eject their castings on the surface of the ground.\r\nWhen they can find any cavity, as when burrowing in newly turned-up\r\nearth, or between the stems of banked-up plants, they deposit their\r\ncastings in such places.  So again any hollow beneath a large stone lying\r\non the surface of the ground, is soon filled up with their castings.\r\nAccording to Hensen, old burrows are habitually used for this purpose;\r\nbut as far as my experience serves, this is not the case, excepting with\r\nthose near the surface in recently dug ground.  I think that Hensen may\r\nhave been deceived by the walls of old burrows, lined with black earth,\r\nhaving sunk in or collapsed; for black streaks are thus left, and these\r\nare conspicuous when passing through light-coloured soil, and might be\r\nmistaken for completely filled-up burrows.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that old burrows collapse in the course of time; for as we\r\nshall see in the next chapter, the fine earth voided by worms, if spread\r\nout uniformly, would form in many places in the course of a year a layer\r\n0.2 of an inch in thickness; so that at any rate this large amount is not\r\ndeposited within the old unused burrows.  If the burrows did not\r\ncollapse, the whole ground would be first thickly riddled with holes to a\r\ndepth of about ten inches, and in fifty years a hollow unsupported space,\r\nten inches in depth, would be left.  The holes left by the decay of\r\nsuccessively formed roots of trees and plants must likewise collapse in\r\nthe course of time.\r\n\r\nThe burrows of worms run down perpendicularly or a little obliquely, and\r\nwhere the soil is at all argillaceous, there is no difficulty in\r\nbelieving that the walls would slowly flow or slide inwards during very\r\nwet weather.  When, however, the soil is sandy or mingled with many small\r\nstones, it can hardly be viscous enough to flow inwards during even the\r\nwettest weather; but another agency may here come into play.  After much\r\nrain the ground swells, and as it cannot expand laterally, the surface\r\nrises; during dry weather it sinks again.  For instance, a large flat\r\nstone laid on the surface of a field sank 3.33 mm. whilst the weather was\r\ndry between May 9th and June 13th, and rose 1.91 mm, between September\r\n7th and 19th of the same year, much rain having fallen during the latter\r\npart of this time.  During frosts and thaws the movements were twice as\r\ngreat.  These observations were made by my son Horace, who will hereafter\r\npublish an account of the movements of this stone during successive wet\r\nand dry seasons, and of the effects of its being undermined by worms.\r\nNow when the ground swells, if it be penetrated by cylindrical holes,\r\nsuch as worm-burrows, their walls will tend to yield and be pressed\r\ninwards; and the yielding will be greater in the deeper parts (supposing\r\nthe whole to be equally moistened) from the greater weight of the\r\nsuperincumbent soil which has to be raised, than in the parts near the\r\nsurface.  When the ground dries, the walls will shrink a little and the\r\nburrows will be a little enlarged.  Their enlargement, however, through\r\nthe lateral contraction of the ground, will not be favoured, but rather\r\nopposed, by the weight of the superincumbent soil.\r\n\r\n_Distribution of Worms_.—Earth-worms are found in all parts of the world,\r\nand some of the genera have an enormous range. {113}  They inhabit the\r\nmost isolated islands; they abound in Iceland, and are known to exist in\r\nthe West Indies, St. Helena, Madagascar, New Caledonia and Tahiti.  In\r\nthe Antarctic regions, worms from Kerguelen Land have been described by\r\nRay Lankester; and I found them in the Falkland Islands.  How they reach\r\nsuch isolated islands is at present quite unknown.  They are easily\r\nkilled by salt-water, and it does not appear probable that young worms or\r\ntheir egg-capsules could be carried in earth adhering to the feet or\r\nbeaks of land-birds.  Moreover Kerguelen Land is not now inhabited by any\r\nland-bird.\r\n\r\nIn this volume we are chiefly concerned with the earth cast up by worms,\r\nand I have gleaned a few facts on this subject with respect to distant\r\nlands.  Worms throw up plenty of castings in the United States.  In\r\nVenezuela, castings, probably ejected by species of Urochæta, are common\r\nin the gardens and fields, but not in the forests, as I hear from Dr.\r\nErnst of Caracas.  He collected 156 castings from the court-yard of his\r\nhouse, having an area of 200 square yards.  They varied in bulk from half\r\na cubic centimeter to five cubic centimeters, and were on an average\r\nthree cubic centimeters.  They were, therefore, of small size in\r\ncomparison with those often found in England; for six large castings from\r\na field near my house averaged 16 cubic centimeters.  Several species of\r\nearth-worms are common in St. Catharina in South Brazil, and Fritz Müller\r\ninforms me “that in most parts of the forests and pasture-lands, the\r\nwhole soil, to a depth of a quarter of a metre, looks as if it had passed\r\nrepeatedly through the intestines of earth-worms, even where hardly any\r\ncastings are to be seen on the surface.”  A gigantic but very rare\r\nspecies is found there, the burrows of which are sometimes even two\r\ncentimeters or nearly 0.8 of an inch in diameter, and which apparently\r\npenetrate the ground to a great depth.\r\n\r\nIn the dry climate of New South Wales, I hardly expected that worms would\r\nbe common; but Dr. G. Krefft of Sydney, to whom I applied, after making\r\ninquiries from gardeners and others, and from his own observations,\r\ninforms me that their castings abound.  He sent me some collected after\r\nheavy rain, and they consisted of little pellets, about 0.15 inch in\r\ndiameter; and the blackened sandy earth of which they were formed still\r\ncohered with considerable tenacity.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. John Scott of the Botanic Gardens near Calcutta made many\r\nobservations for me on worms living under the hot and humid climate of\r\nBengal.  The castings abound almost everywhere, in jungles and in the\r\nopen ground, to a greater degree, as he thinks, than in England.  After\r\nthe water has subsided from the flooded rice-fields, the whole surface\r\nvery soon becomes studded with castings—a fact which much surprised Mr.\r\nScott, as he did not know how long worms could survive beneath water.\r\nThey cause much trouble in the Botanic garden, “for some of the finest of\r\nour lawns can be kept in anything like order only by being almost daily\r\nrolled; if left undisturbed for a few days they become studded with large\r\ncastings.”  These closely resemble those described as abounding near\r\nNice; and they are probably the work of a species of Perichæta.  They\r\nstand up like towers, with an open passage in the centre.\r\n\r\n   [Picture: Fig. 3: A tower-like casting.  Fig. 4: A casting from the\r\n                            Nilgiri Mountains]\r\n\r\nA figure of one of these castings from a photograph is here given (Fig.\r\n3).  The largest received by me was 3½ inches in height and 1.35 inch in\r\ndiameter; another was only ¾ inch in diameter and 2¾ in height.  In the\r\nfollowing year, Mr. Scott measured several of the largest; one was 6\r\ninches in height and nearly 1½ in diameter: two others were 5 inches in\r\nheight and respectively 2 and rather more than 2½ inches in diameter.\r\nThe average weight of the 22 castings sent to me was 35 grammes (1¼ oz.);\r\nand one of them weighed 44.8 grammes (or 2 oz.). All these castings were\r\nthrown up either in one night or in two.  Where the ground in Bengal is\r\ndry, as under large trees, castings of a different kind are found in vast\r\nnumbers: these consist of little oval or conical bodies, from about the\r\n1/20 to rather above 1/10 of an inch in length.  They are obviously\r\nvoided by a distinct species of worms.\r\n\r\nThe period during which worms near Calcutta display such extraordinary\r\nactivity lasts for only a little over two months, namely, during the cool\r\nseason after the rains.  At this time they are generally found within\r\nabout 10 inches beneath the surface.  During the hot season they burrow\r\nto a greater depth, and are then found coiled up and apparently\r\nhybernating.  Mr. Scott has never seen them at a greater depth than 2½\r\nfeet, but has heard of their having been found at 4 feet.  Within the\r\nforests, fresh castings may be found even during the hot season.  The\r\nworms in the Botanic garden, during the cool and dry season, draw many\r\nleaves and little sticks into the mouths of their burrows, like our\r\nEnglish worms; but they rarely act in this manner during the rainy\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nMr. Scott saw worm-castings on the lofty mountains of Sikkim in North\r\nIndia.  In South India Dr. King found in one place, on the plateau of the\r\nNilgiris, at an elevation of 7000 feet, “a good many castings,” which are\r\ninteresting for their great size.  The worms which eject them are seen\r\nonly during the wet season, and are reported to be from 12 to 15 inches\r\nin length, and as thick as a man’s little finger.  These castings were\r\ncollected by Dr. King after a period of 110 days without any rain; and\r\nthey must have been ejected either during the north-east or more probably\r\nduring the previous south-west monsoon; for their surfaces had suffered\r\nsome disintegration and they were penetrated by many fine roots.  A\r\ndrawing is here given (Fig. 4) of one which seems to have best retained\r\nits original size and appearance.  Notwithstanding some loss from\r\ndisintegration, five of the largest of these castings (after having been\r\nwell sun-dried) weighed each on an average 89.5 grammes, or above 3 oz.;\r\nand the largest weighed 123.14 grammes, or 4⅓ oz.,—that is, above a\r\nquarter of a pound!  The largest convolutions were rather more than one\r\ninch in diameter; but it is probable that they had subsided a little\r\nwhilst soft, and that their diameters had thus been increased.  Some had\r\nflowed so much that they now consisted of a pile of almost flat confluent\r\ncakes.  All were formed of fine, rather light-coloured earth, and were\r\nsurprisingly hard and compact, owing no doubt to the animal matter by\r\nwhich the particles of earth had been cemented together.  They did not\r\ndisintegrate, even when left for some hours in water.  Although they had\r\nbeen cast up on the surface of gravelly soil, they contained extremely\r\nfew bits of rock, the largest of which was only 0.15 inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nDr. King saw in Ceylon a worm about 2 feet in length and ½ inch in\r\ndiameter; and he was told that it was a very common species during the\r\nwet season.  These worms must throw up castings at least as large as\r\nthose on the Nilgiri Mountains; but Dr. King saw none during his short\r\nvisit to Ceylon.\r\n\r\nSufficient facts have now been given, showing that worms do much work in\r\nbringing up fine earth to the surface in most or all parts of the world,\r\nand under the most different climates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE AMOUNT OF FINE EARTH BROUGHT UP BY WORMS TO THE SURFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nRate at which various objects strewed on the surface of grass-fields are\r\ncovered up by the castings of worms—The burial of a paved path—The slow\r\nsubsidence of great stones left on the surface—The number of worms which\r\nlive within a given space—The weight of earth ejected from a burrow, and\r\nfrom all the burrows within a given space—The thickness of the layer of\r\nmould which the castings on a given space would form within a given time\r\nif uniformly spread out—The slow rate at which mould can increase to a\r\ngreat thickness—Conclusion.\r\n\r\nWE now come to the more immediate subject of this volume, namely, the\r\namount of earth which is brought up by worms from beneath the surface,\r\nand is afterwards spread out more or less completely by the rain and\r\nwind.  The amount can be judged of by two methods,—by the rate at which\r\nobjects left on the surface are buried, and more accurately by weighing\r\nthe quantity brought up within a given time.  We will begin with the\r\nfirst method, as it was first followed.\r\n\r\nNear Mael Hall in Staffordshire, quick-lime had been spread about the\r\nyear 1827 thickly over a field of good pasture-land, which had not since\r\nbeen ploughed.  Some square holes were dug in this field in the beginning\r\nof October 1837; and the sections showed a layer of turf, formed by the\r\nmatted roots of the grasses, ½ inch in thickness, beneath which, at a\r\ndepth of 2½ inches (or 3 inches from the surface), a layer of the lime in\r\npowder or in small lumps could be distinctly seen running all round the\r\nvertical sides of the holes.  The soil beneath the layer of lime was\r\neither gravelly or of a coarse sandy nature, and differed considerably in\r\nappearance from the overlying dark-coloured fine mould.  Coal-cinders had\r\nbeen spread over a part of this same field either in the year 1833 or\r\n1834; and when the above holes were dug, that is after an interval of 3\r\nor 4 years, the cinders formed a line of black spots round the holes, at\r\na depth of 1 inch beneath the surface, parallel to and above the white\r\nlayer of lime.  Over another part of this field cinders had been strewed,\r\nonly about half-a-year before, and these either still lay on the surface\r\nor were entangled among the roots of the grasses; and I here saw the\r\ncommencement of the burying process, for worm-castings had been heaped on\r\nseveral of the smaller fragments.  After an interval of 4¾ years this\r\nfield was re-examined, and now the two layers of lime and cinders were\r\nfound almost everywhere at a greater depth than before by nearly 1 inch,\r\nwe will say by ¾ of an inch.  Therefore mould to an average thickness of\r\n0.22 of an inch had been annually brought up by the worms, and had been\r\nspread over the surface of this field.\r\n\r\nCoal-cinders had been strewed over another field, at a date which could\r\nnot be positively ascertained, so thickly that they formed (October,\r\n1837) a layer, 1 inch in thickness at a depth of about 3 inches from the\r\nsurface.  The layer was so continuous that the over-lying dark vegetable\r\nmould was connected with the sub-soil of red clay only by the roots of\r\nthe grasses; and when these were broken, the mould and the red clay fell\r\napart.  In a third field, on which coal-cinders and burnt marl had been\r\nstrewed several times at unknown dates, holes were dug in 1842; and a\r\nlayer of cinders could be traced at a depth of 3½ inches, beneath which\r\nat a depth of 9½ inches from the surface there was a line of cinders\r\ntogether with burnt marl.  On the sides of one hole there were two layers\r\nof cinders, at 2 and 3½ inches beneath the surface; and below them at a\r\ndepth in parts of 9½, and in other parts of 10½ inches there were\r\nfragments of burnt marl.  In a fourth field two layers of lime, one above\r\nthe other, could be distinctly traced, and beneath them a layer of\r\ncinders and burnt marl at a depth of from 10 to 12 inches below the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n  [Picture: Fig. 5: Section of the vegetable mould in a field.  Fig. 6:\r\n                  Traverse section across a large stone]\r\n\r\nA piece of waste, swampy land was enclosed, drained, ploughed, harrowed\r\nand thickly covered in the year 1822 with burnt marl and cinders.  It was\r\nsowed with grass seeds, and now supports a tolerably good but coarse\r\npasture.  Holes were dug in this field in 1837, or 15 years after its\r\nreclamation, and we see in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 5), reduced to\r\nhalf of the natural scale, that the turf was ½ inch thick, beneath which\r\nthere was a layer of vegetable mould 2½ inches thick.  This layer did not\r\ncontain fragments of any kind; but beneath it there was a layer of mould,\r\n1½ inch in thickness, full of fragments of burnt marl, conspicuous from\r\ntheir red colour, one of which near the bottom was an inch in length; and\r\nother fragments of coal-cinders together with a few white quartz pebbles.\r\nBeneath this layer and at a depth of 4½ inches from the surface, the\r\noriginal black, peaty, sandy soil with a few quartz pebbles was\r\nencountered.  Here therefore the fragments of burnt marl and cinders had\r\nbeen covered in the course of 15 years by a layer of fine vegetable\r\nmould, only 2½ inches in thickness, excluding the turf.  Six and a half\r\nyears subsequently this field was re-examined, and the fragments were now\r\nfound at from 4 to 5 inches beneath the surface.  So that in this\r\ninterval of 6½ years, about 1½ inch of mould had been added to the\r\nsuperficial layer.  I am surprised that a greater quantity had not been\r\nbrought up during the whole 21½ years, for in the closely underlying\r\nblack, peaty soil there were many worms.  It is, however, probable that\r\nformerly, whilst the land remained poor, worms were scanty; and the mould\r\nwould then have accumulated slowly.  The average annual increase of\r\nthickness for the whole period is 0.19 of an inch.\r\n\r\nTwo other cases are worth recording.  In the spring of 1835, a field,\r\nwhich had long existed as poor pasture and was so swampy that it trembled\r\nslightly when stamped on, was thickly covered with red sand so that the\r\nwhole surface appeared at first bright red.  When holes were dug in this\r\nfield after an interval of about 2½ years, the sand formed a layer at a\r\ndepth of ¾ in. beneath the surface.  In 1842 (i.e., 7 years after the\r\nsand had been laid on) fresh holes were dug, and now the red sand formed\r\na distinct layer, 2 inches beneath the surface, or 1½ inch beneath the\r\nturf; so that on an average, 0.21 inch of mould had been annually brought\r\nto the surface.  Immediately beneath the layer of red sand, the original\r\nsubstratum of black sandy peat extended.\r\n\r\nA grass field, likewise not far from Maer Hall, had formerly been thickly\r\ncovered with marl, and was then left for several years as pasture; it was\r\nafterwards ploughed.  A friend had three trenches dug in this field 28\r\nyears after the application of the marl, {126} and a layer of the marl\r\nfragments could be traced at a depth, carefully measured, of 12 inches in\r\nsome parts, and of 14 inches in other parts.  This difference in depth\r\ndepended on the layer being horizontal, whilst the surface consisted of\r\nridges and furrows from the field having been ploughed.  The tenant\r\nassured me that it had never been turned up to a greater depth than from\r\n6 to 8 inches; and as the fragments formed an unbroken horizontal layer\r\nfrom 12 to 14 inches beneath the surface, these must have been buried by\r\nthe worms whilst the land was in pasture before it was ploughed, for\r\notherwise they would have been indiscriminately scattered by the plough\r\nthroughout the whole thickness of the soil.  Four-and-a-half years\r\nafterwards I had three holes dug in this field, in which potatoes had\r\nbeen lately planted, and the layer of marl-fragments was now found 13\r\ninches beneath the bottoms of the furrows, and therefore probably 15\r\ninches beneath the general level of the field.  It should, however, be\r\nobserved that the thickness of the blackish sandy soil, which had been\r\nthrown up by the worms above the marl-fragments in the course of 32½\r\nyears, would have measured less than 15 inches, if the field had always\r\nremained as pasture, for the soil would in this case have been much more\r\ncompact.  The fragments of marl almost rested on an undisturbed\r\nsubstratum of white sand with quartz pebbles; and as this would be little\r\nattractive to worms, the mould would hereafter be very slowly increased\r\nby their action.\r\n\r\nWe will now give some cases of the action of worms, on land differing\r\nwidely from the dry sandy or the swampy pastures just described.  The\r\nchalk formation extends all round my house in Kent; and its surface, from\r\nhaving been exposed during an immense period to the dissolving action of\r\nrain-water, is extremely irregular, being abruptly festooned and\r\npenetrated by many deep well-like cavities. {128}  During the dissolution\r\nof the chalk, the insoluble matter, including a vast number of unrolled\r\nflints of all sizes, has been left on the surface and forms a bed of\r\nstiff red clay, full of flints, and generally from 6 to 14 feet in\r\nthickness.  Over the red clay, wherever the land has long remained as\r\npasture, there is a layer a few inches in thickness, of dark-coloured\r\nvegetable mould.\r\n\r\nA quantity of broken chalk was spread, on December 20, 1842, over a part\r\nof a field near my house, which had existed as pasture certainly for 30,\r\nprobably for twice or thrice as many years.  The chalk was laid on the\r\nland for the sake of observing at some future period to what depth it\r\nwould become buried.  At the end of November, 1871, that is after an\r\ninterval of 29 years, a trench was dug across this part of the field; and\r\na line of white nodules could be traced on both sides of the trench, at a\r\ndepth of 7 inches from the surface.  The mould, therefore, (excluding the\r\nturf) had here been thrown up at an average rate of 0.22 inch per year.\r\nBeneath the line of chalk nodules there was in parts hardly any fine\r\nearth free of flints, while in other parts there was a layer, 2¼ inches\r\nin thickness.  In this latter case the mould was altogether 9¼ inches\r\nthick; and in one such spot a nodule of chalk and a smooth flint pebble,\r\nboth of which must have been left at some former time on the surface,\r\nwere found at this depth.  At from 11 to 12 inches beneath the surface,\r\nthe undisturbed reddish clay, full of flints, extended.  The appearance\r\nof the above nodules of chalk surprised me, much at first, as they\r\nclosely resembled water-worn pebbles, whereas the freshly-broken\r\nfragments had been angular.  But on examining the nodules with a lens,\r\nthey no longer appeared water-worn, for their surfaces were pitted\r\nthrough unequal corrosion, and minute, sharp points, formed of broken\r\nfossil shells, projected from them.  It was evident that the corners of\r\nthe original fragments of chalk had been wholly dissolved, from\r\npresenting a large surface to the carbonic acid dissolved in the\r\nrain-water and to that generated in soil containing vegetable matter, as\r\nwell as to the humus-acids. {131}  The projecting corners would also,\r\nrelatively to the other parts, have been embraced by a larger number of\r\nliving rootlets; and these have the power of even attacking marble, as\r\nSachs has shown.  Thus, in the course of 29 years, buried angular\r\nfragments of chalk had been converted into well-rounded nodules.\r\n\r\nAnother part of this same field was mossy, and as it was thought that\r\nsifted coal-cinders would improve the pasture, a thick layer was spread\r\nover this part either in 1842 or 1843, and another layer some years\r\nafterwards.  In 1871 a trench was here dug, and many cinders lay in a\r\nline at a depth of 7 inches beneath the surface, with another line at a\r\ndepth of 5½ inches parallel to the one beneath.  In another part of this\r\nfield, which had formerly existed as a separate one, and which it was\r\nbelieved had been pasture-land for more than a century, trenches were dug\r\nto see how thick the vegetable mould was.  By chance the first trench was\r\nmade at a spot where at some former period, certainly more than forty\r\nyears before, a large hole had been filled up with coarse red clay,\r\nflints, fragments of chalk, and gravel; and here the fine vegetable mould\r\nwas only from 4⅛ to 4⅜ inches in thickness.  In another and undisturbed\r\nplace, the mould varied much in thickness, namely, from 6½ to 8½ inches;\r\nbeneath which a few small fragments of brick were found in one place.\r\nFrom these several cases, it would appear that during the last 29 years\r\nmould has been heaped on the surface at an average annual rate of from\r\n0.2 to 0.22 of an inch.  But in this district when a ploughed field is\r\nfirst laid down in grass, the mould accumulates at a much slower rate.\r\nThe rate, also, must become very much slower after a bed of mould,\r\nseveral inches in thickness, has been formed; for the worms then live\r\nchiefly near the surface, and burrow down to a greater depth so as to\r\nbring up fresh earth from below, only during the winter when the weather\r\nis very cold (at which time worms were found in this field at a depth of\r\n26 inches) and during summer, when the weather is very dry.\r\n\r\nA field, which adjoins the one just described, slopes in one part rather\r\nsteeply (viz., at from 10° to 15°); this part was last ploughed in 1841,\r\nwas then harrowed and left to become pasture-land.  For several years it\r\nwas clothed with an extremely scant vegetation, and was so thickly\r\ncovered with small and large flints (some of them half as large as a\r\nchild’s head) that the field was always called by my sons “the stony\r\nfield.”  When they ran down the slope the stones clattered together, I\r\nremember doubting whether I should live to see these larger flints\r\ncovered with vegetable mould and turf.  But the smaller stones\r\ndisappeared before many years had elapsed, as did every one of the larger\r\nones after a time; so that after thirty years (1871) a horse could gallop\r\nover the compact turf from one end of the field to the other, and not\r\nstrike a single stone with his shoes.  To anyone who remembered the\r\nappearance of the field in 1842, the transformation was wonderful.  This\r\nwas certainly the work of the worms, for though castings were not\r\nfrequent for several years, yet some were thrown up month after month,\r\nand these gradually increased in numbers as the pasture improved.  In the\r\nyear 1871 a trench was dug on the above slope, and the blades of grass\r\nwere cut off close to the roots, so that the thickness of the turf and of\r\nthe vegetable mould could be measured accurately.  The turf was rather\r\nless than half an inch, and the mould, which did not contain any stones,\r\n2½ inches in thickness.  Beneath this lay coarse clayey earth full of\r\nflints, like that in any of the neighbouring ploughed fields.  This\r\ncoarse earth easily fell apart from the overlying mould when a spit was\r\nlifted up.  The average rate of accumulation of the mould during the\r\nwhole thirty years was only .083 inch per year (i.e., nearly one inch in\r\ntwelve years); but the rate must have been much slower at first, and\r\nafterwards considerably quicker.\r\n\r\nThe transformation in the appearance of this field, which had been\r\neffected beneath my eyes, was afterwards rendered the more striking, when\r\nI examined in Knole Park a dense forest of lofty beech-trees, beneath\r\nwhich nothing grew.  Here the ground was thickly strewed with large naked\r\nstones, and worm-castings were almost wholly absent.  Obscure lines and\r\nirregularities on the surface indicated that the land had been cultivated\r\nsome centuries ago.  It is probable that a thick wood of young\r\nbeech-trees sprung up so quickly, that time enough was not allowed for\r\nworms to cover up the stones with their castings, before the site became\r\nunfitted for their existence.  Anyhow the contrast between the state of\r\nthe now miscalled “stony field,” well stocked with worms, and the present\r\nstate of the ground beneath the old beech-trees in Knole Park, where\r\nworms appeared to be absent, was striking.\r\n\r\nA narrow path running across part of my lawn was paved in 1843 with small\r\nflagstones, set edgeways; but worms threw up many castings and weeds grew\r\nthickly between them.  During several years the path was weeded and\r\nswept; but ultimately the weeds and worms prevailed, and the gardener\r\nceased to sweep, merely mowing off the weeds, as often as the lawn was\r\nmowed.  The path soon became almost covered up, and after several years\r\nno trace of it was left.  On removing, in 1877, the thin overlying layer\r\nof turf, the small flag-stones, all in their proper places, were found\r\ncovered by an inch of fine mould.\r\n\r\nTwo recently published accounts of substances strewed on the surface of\r\npasture-land, having become buried through the action of worms, may be\r\nhere noticed.  The Rev. H. C. Key had a ditch cut in a field, over which\r\ncoal-ashes had been spread, as it was believed, eighteen years before;\r\nand on the clean-cut perpendicular sides of the ditch, at a depth of at\r\nleast seven inches, there could be seen, for a length of 60 yards, “a\r\ndistinct, very even, narrow line of coal-ashes, mixed with small coal,\r\nperfectly parallel with the top-sward.” {136a}  This parallelism and the\r\nlength of the section give interest to the case.  Secondly, Mr. Dancer\r\nstates {136b} that crushed bones had been thickly strewed over a field;\r\nand “some years afterwards” these were found “several inches below the\r\nsurface, at a uniform depth.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Zincke informs me that he has lately had an orchard dug to\r\nthe unusual depth of 4 feet.  The upper 18 inches consisted of\r\ndark-coloured vegetable mould, and the next 18 inches of sandy loam,\r\ncontaining in the lower part many rolled pieces of sandstone, with some\r\nbits of brick and tile, probably of Roman origin, as remains of this\r\nperiod have been found close by.  The sandy loam rested on an indurated\r\nferruginous pan of yellow clay, on the surface of which two perfect celts\r\nwere found.  If, as seems probable, the celts were originally left on the\r\nsurface of the land, they have since been covered up with earth 3 feet in\r\nthickness, all of which has probably passed through the bodies of worms,\r\nexcepting the stones which may have been scattered on the surface at\r\ndifferent times, together with manure or by other means.  It is difficult\r\notherwise to understand the source of the 18 inches of sandy loam, which\r\ndiffered from the overlying dark vegetable mould, after both had been\r\nburnt, only in being of a brighter red colour, and in not being quite so\r\nfine-grained.  But on this view we must suppose that the carbon in\r\nvegetable mould, when it lies at some little depth beneath the surface\r\nand does not continually receive decaying vegetable matter from above,\r\nloses its dark colour in the course of centuries; but whether this is\r\nprobable I do not know.\r\n\r\nWorms appear to act in the same manner in New Zealand as in Europe; for\r\nProfessor J. von Haast has described {138a} a section near the coast,\r\nconsisting of mica-schist, “covered by 5 or 6 feet of loess, above which\r\nabout 12 inches of vegetable soil had accumulated.”  Between the loess\r\nand the mould there was a layer from 3 to 6 inches in thickness,\r\nconsisting of “cores, implements, flakes, and chips, all manufactured\r\nfrom hard basaltic rock.”  It is therefore probable that the aborigines,\r\nat some former period, had left these objects on the surface, and that\r\nthey had afterwards been slowly covered up by the castings of worms.\r\n\r\nFarmers in England are well aware that objects of all kinds, left on the\r\nsurface of pasture-land, after a time disappear, or, as they say, work\r\nthemselves downwards.  How powdered lime, cinders, and heavy stones, can\r\nwork down, and at the same rate, through the matted roots of a\r\ngrass-covered surface, is a question which has probably never occurred to\r\nthem. {138b}\r\n\r\n_The Sinking of great Stones through the Action of Worms_.—When a stone\r\nof large size and of irregular shape is left on the surface of the\r\nground, it rests, of course, on the more protuberant parts; but worms\r\nsoon fill up with their castings all the hollow spaces on the lower side;\r\nfor, as Hensen remarks, they like the shelter of stones.  As soon as the\r\nhollows are filled up, the worms eject the earth which they have\r\nswallowed beyond the circumference of the stones; and thus the surface of\r\nthe ground is raised all round the stone.  As the burrows excavated\r\ndirectly beneath the stone after a time collapse, the stone sinks a\r\nlittle. {139}  Hence it is, that boulders which at some ancient period\r\nhave rolled down from a rocky mountain or cliff on to a meadow at its\r\nbase, are always somewhat imbedded in the soil; and, when removed, leave\r\nan exact impression of their lower surfaces in the underlying fine mould.\r\nIf, however, a boulder is of such huge dimensions, that the earth beneath\r\nis kept dry, such earth will not be inhabited by worms, and the boulder\r\nwill not sink into the ground.\r\n\r\nA lime-kiln formerly stood in a grass-field near Leith Hill Place in\r\nSurrey, and was pulled down 35 years before my visit; all the loose\r\nrubbish had been carted away, excepting three large stones of quartzose\r\nsandstone, which it was thought might hereafter be of some use.  An old\r\nworkman remembered that they had been left on a bare surface of broken\r\nbricks and mortar, close to the foundations of the kiln; but the whole\r\nsurrounding surface is now covered with turf and mould.  The two largest\r\nof these stones had never since been moved; nor could this easily have\r\nbeen done, as, when I had them removed, it was the work of two men with\r\nlevers.  One of these stones, and not the largest, was 64 inches long, 17\r\ninches broad, and from 9 to 10 inches in thickness.  Its lower surface\r\nwas somewhat protuberant in the middle; and this part still rested on\r\nbroken bricks and mortar, showing the truth of the old workman’s account.\r\nBeneath the brick rubbish the natural sandy soil, full of fragments of\r\nsandstone was found; and this could have yielded very little, if at all,\r\nto the weight of the stone, as might have been expected if the sub-soil\r\nhad been clay.  The surface of the field, for a distance of about 9\r\ninches round the stone, gradually sloped up to it, and close to the stone\r\nstood in most places about 4 inches above the surrounding ground.  The\r\nbase of the stone was buried from 1 to 2 inches beneath the general\r\nlevel, and the upper surface projected about 8 inches above this level,\r\nor about 4 inches above the sloping border of turf.  After the removal of\r\nthe stone it became evident that one of its pointed ends must at first\r\nhave stood clear above the ground by some inches, but its upper surface\r\nwas now on a level with the surrounding turf.  When the stone was\r\nremoved, an exact cast of its lower side, forming a shallow crateriform\r\nhollow, was left, the inner surface of which consisted of fine black\r\nmould, excepting where the more protuberant parts rested on the\r\nbrick-rubbish.  A transverse section of this stone, together with its\r\nbed, drawn from measurements made after it had been displaced, is here\r\ngiven on a scale of ½ inch to a foot (Fig. 6).  The turf-covered border\r\nwhich sloped up to the stone, consisted of fine vegetable mould, in one\r\npart 7 inches in thickness.  This evidently consisted of worm-castings,\r\nseveral of which had been recently ejected.  The whole stone had sunk in\r\nthe thirty-five years, as far as I could judge, about 1½ inch; and this\r\nmust have been due to the brick-rubbish beneath the more protuberant\r\nparts having been undermined by worms.  At this rate the upper surface of\r\nthe stone, if it had been left undisturbed, would have sunk to the\r\ngeneral level of the field in 247 years; but before this could have\r\noccurred, some earth would have been washed down by heavy rain from the\r\ncastings on the raised border of turf over the upper surface of the\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nThe second stone was larger that the one just described, viz., 67 inches\r\nin length, 39 in breadth, and 15 in thickness.  The lower surface was\r\nnearly flat, so that the worms must soon have been compelled to eject\r\ntheir castings beyond its circumference.  The stone as a whole had sunk\r\nabout 2 inches into the ground.  At this rate it would have required 262\r\nyears for its upper surface to have sunk to the general level of the\r\nfield.  The upwardly sloping, turf-covered border round the stone was\r\nbroader than in the last case, viz., from 14 to 16 inches; and why this\r\nshould be so, I could see no reason.  In most parts this border was not\r\nso high as in the last case, viz., from 2 to 2½ inches, but in one place\r\nit was as much as 5½.  Its average height close to the stone was probably\r\nabout 3 inches, and it thinned out to nothing.  If so, a layer of fine\r\nearth, 15 inches in breadth and 1½ inch in average thickness, of\r\nsufficient length to surround the whole of the much elongated slab, must\r\nhave been brought up by the worms in chief part from beneath the stone in\r\nthe course of 35 years.  This amount would be amply sufficient to account\r\nfor its having sunk about 2 inches into the ground; more especially if we\r\nbear in mind that a good deal of the finest earth would have been washed\r\nby heavy rain from the castings ejected on the sloping border down to the\r\nlevel of the field.  Some fresh castings were seen close to the stone.\r\nNevertheless, on digging a large hole to a depth of 18 inches where the\r\nstone had lain, only two worms and a few burrows were seen, although the\r\nsoil was damp and seemed favourable for worms.  There were some large\r\ncolonies of ants beneath the stone, and possibly since their\r\nestablishment the worms had decreased in number.\r\n\r\nThe third stone was only about half as large as the others; and two\r\nstrong boys could together have rolled it over.  I have no doubt that it\r\nhad been rolled over at a moderately recent time, for it now lay at some\r\ndistance from the two other stones at the bottom of a little adjoining\r\nslope.  It rested also on fine earth, instead of partly on brick-rubbish.\r\nIn agreement with this conclusion, the raised surrounding border of turf\r\nwas only 1 inch high in some parts, and 2 inches in other parts.  There\r\nwere no colonies of ants beneath this stone, and on digging a hole where\r\nit had lain, several burrows and worms were found.\r\n\r\nAt Stonehenge, some of the outer Druidical stones are now prostrate,\r\nhaving fallen at a remote but unknown period; and these have become\r\nburied to a moderate depth in the ground.  They are surrounded by sloping\r\nborders of turf, on which recent castings were seen.  Close to one of\r\nthese fallen stones, which was 17 ft long, 6 ft. broad, and 28½ inches\r\nthick, a hole was dug; and here the vegetable mould was at least 9½\r\ninches in thickness.  At this depth a flint was found, and a little\r\nhigher up on one side of the hole a fragment of glass.  The base of the\r\nstone lay about 9½ inches beneath the level of the surrounding ground,\r\nand its upper surface 19 inches above the ground.\r\n\r\nA hole was also dug close to a second huge stone, which in falling had\r\nbroken into two pieces; and this must have happened long ago, judging\r\nfrom the weathered aspect of the fractured ends.  The base was buried to\r\na depth of 10 inches, as was ascertained by driving an iron skewer\r\nhorizontally into the ground beneath it.  The vegetable mould forming the\r\nturf-covered sloping border round the stone, on which many castings had\r\nrecently been ejected, was 10 inches in thickness; and most of this mould\r\nmust have been brought up by worms from beneath its base.  At a distance\r\nof 8 yards from the stone, the mould was only 5½ inches in thickness\r\n(with a piece of tobacco pipe at a depth of 4 inches), and this rested on\r\nbroken flint and chalk which could not have easily yielded to the\r\npressure or weight of the stone.\r\n\r\nA straight rod was fixed horizontally (by the aid of a spirit-level)\r\nacross a third fallen stone, which was 7 feet 9 inches long; and the\r\ncontour of the projecting parts and of the adjoining ground, which was\r\nnot quite level, was thus ascertained, as shown in the accompanying\r\ndiagram (Fig. 7) on a scale of ½ inch to a foot.  The turf-covered border\r\nsloped up to the stone on one side to a height of 4 inches, and on the\r\nopposite side to only 2½ inches above the general level.  A hole was dug\r\non the eastern side, and the base of the stone was here found to lie at a\r\ndepth of 4 inches beneath the general level of the ground, and of 8\r\ninches beneath the top of the sloping turf-covered border.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nSufficient evidence has now been given showing that small objects left on\r\nthe surface of the land where worms abound soon get buried, and that\r\nlarge stones sink slowly downwards through the same means.  Every step of\r\nthe process could be followed, from the accidental deposition of a single\r\ncasting on a small object lying loose on the surface, to its being\r\nentangled amidst the matted roots of the turf, and lastly to its being\r\nembedded in the mould at various depths beneath the surface.  When the\r\nsame field was re-examined after the interval of a few years, such\r\nobjects were found at a greater depth than before.  The straightness and\r\nregularity of the lines formed by the imbedded objects, and their\r\nparallelism with the surface of the land, are the most striking features\r\nof the case; for this parallelism shows how equably the worms must have\r\nworked; the result being, however, partly the effect of the washing down\r\nof the fresh castings by rain.  The specific gravity of the objects does\r\nnot affect their rate of sinking, as could be seen by porous cinders,\r\nburnt marl, chalk and quartz pebbles, having all sunk to the same depth\r\nwithin the same time.  Considering the nature of the substratum, which at\r\nLeith Hill Place was sandy soil including many bits of rock, and at\r\nStonehenge, chalk-rubble with broken flints; considering, also, the\r\npresence of the turf-covered sloping border of mould round the great\r\nfragments of stone at both these places, their sinking does not appear to\r\nhave been sensibly aided by their weight, though this was considerable.\r\n{147}\r\n\r\n_On the number of worms which live within a given space_.—We will now\r\nshow, firstly, what a vast number of worms live unseen by us beneath our\r\nfeet, and, secondly, the actual weight of the earth which they bring up\r\nto the surface within a given space and within a given time.  Hensen, who\r\nhas published so full and interesting an account of the habits of worms,\r\n{148} calculates, from the number which he found in a measured space,\r\nthat there must exist 133,000 living worms in a hectare of land, or\r\n53,767 in an acre.  This latter number of worms would weigh 356 pounds,\r\ntaking Hensen’s standard of the weight of a single worm, namely, three\r\ngrams.  It should, however, be noted that this calculation is founded on\r\nthe numbers found in a garden, and Hensen believes that worms are here\r\ntwice as numerous as in corn-fields.  The above result, astonishing\r\nthough it be, seems to me credible, judging from the number of worms\r\nwhich I have sometimes seen, and from the number daily destroyed by birds\r\nwithout the species being exterminated.  Some barrels of bad ale were\r\nleft on Mr. Miller’s land, {149} in the hope of making vinegar, but the\r\nvinegar proved bad, and the barrels were upset.  It should be premised\r\nthat acetic acid is so deadly a poison to worms that Perrier found that a\r\nglass rod dipped into this acid and then into a considerable body of\r\nwater in which worms were immersed, invariably killed them quickly.  On\r\nthe morning after the barrels had been upset, “the heaps of worms which\r\nlay dead on the ground were so amazing, that if Mr. Miller had not seen\r\nthem, he could not have thought it possible for such numbers to have\r\nexisted in the space.”  As further evidence of the large number of worms\r\nwhich live in the ground, Hensen states that he found in a garden\r\nsixty-four open burrows in a space of 14½ square feet, that is, nine in 2\r\nsquare feet.  But the burrows are sometimes much more numerous, for when\r\ndigging in a grass-field near Maer Hall, I found a cake of dry earth, as\r\nlarge as my two open hands, which was penetrated by seven burrows, as\r\nlarge as goose-quills.\r\n\r\n_Weight of the earth ejected from a single burrow_, _and from all the\r\nburrows within a given space_.—With respect to the weight of the earth\r\ndaily ejected by worms, Hensen found that it amounted, in the case of\r\nsome worms which he kept in confinement, and which he appears to have fed\r\nwith leaves, to only 0.5 gram, or less than 8 grains per diem.  But a\r\nvery much larger amount must be ejected by worms in their natural state,\r\nat the periods when they consume earth as food instead of leaves, and\r\nwhen they are making deep burrows.  This is rendered almost certain by\r\nthe following weights of the castings thrown up at the mouths of single\r\nburrows; the whole of which appeared to have been ejected within no long\r\ntime, as was certainly the case in several instances.  The castings were\r\ndried (excepting in one specified instance) by exposure during many days\r\nto the sun or before a hot fire.\r\n\r\n WEIGHT OF THE CASTINGS ACCUMULATED AT THE MOUTH OF A SINGLE BURROW.\r\n(1.)  Down, Kent (sub-soil red clay, full of flints,              3.98\r\nover-lying the chalk).  The largest casting which I could\r\nfind on the flanks of a steep valley, the sub-soil being\r\nhere shallow.  In this one case, the casting was not well\r\ndried\r\n(2.)  Down.—Largest casting which I could find (consisting        3.87\r\nchiefly of calcareous matter), on extremely poor pasture\r\nland at the bottom of the valley mentioned under (1.)\r\n(3.)  Down.—A large casting, but not of unusual size, from        1.22\r\na nearly level field, poor pasture, laid down in a grass\r\nabout 35 years before\r\n(4.)  Down.  Average weight of 11 not large castings               0.7\r\nejected on a sloping surface on my lawn, after they had\r\nsuffered some loss of weight from being exposed during a\r\nconsiderable length of time to rain\r\n(5.)  Near Nice in France.—Average weight of 12 castings of       1.37\r\nordinary dimensions, collected by Dr. King on land which\r\nhad not been mown for a long time and where worms abounded,\r\nviz., a lawn protected by shrubberies near the sea; soil\r\nsandy and calcareous; these castings had been exposed for\r\nsome time to rain, before being collected, and must have\r\nlost some weight by disintegration, but they still retained\r\ntheir form\r\n(6.)  The heaviest of the above twelve castings                   1.76\r\n(7.)   Lower Bengal.—Average weight of 22 castings,               1.24\r\ncollected by Mr. J. Scott, and stated by him to have been\r\nthrown up in the course of one or two nights\r\n(8.)  The heaviest of the above 22 castings                       2.09\r\n(9.)  Nilgiri Mountains, S. India; average weight of the 5        3.15\r\nlargest castings collected by Dr. King.  They had been\r\nexposed to the rain of the last monsoon, and must have lost\r\nsome weight\r\n(10.)  The heaviest of the above 5 castings                       4.34\r\n\r\nIn this table we see that castings which had been ejected at the mouth of\r\nthe same burrow, and which in most cases appeared fresh and always\r\nretained their vermiform configuration, generally exceeded an ounce in\r\nweight after being dried, and sometimes nearly equalled a quarter of a\r\npound.  On the Nilgiri mountains one casting even exceeded this latter\r\nweight.  The largest castings in England were found on extremely poor\r\npasture-land; and these, as far as I have seen, are generally larger than\r\nthose on land producing a rich vegetation.  It would appear that worms\r\nhave to swallow a greater amount of earth on poor than on rich land, in\r\norder to obtain sufficient nutriment.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the tower-like castings near Nice (Nos. 5 and 6 in the\r\nabove table), Dr. King often found five or six of them on a square foot\r\nof surface; and these, judging from their average weight, would have\r\nweighed together 7½ ounces; so that the weight of those on a square yard\r\nwould have been 4 lb. 3½ oz.  Dr. King collected, near the close of the\r\nyear 1872, all the castings which still retained their vermiform shape,\r\nwhether broken down or not, from a square foot, in a place abounding with\r\nworms, on the summit of a bank, where no castings could have rolled down\r\nfrom above.  These castings must have been ejected, as he judged from\r\ntheir appearance in reference to the rainy and dry periods near Nice,\r\nwithin the previous five or six months; they weighed 9½ oz., or 5 lb. 5½\r\noz. per square yard.  After an interval of four months, Dr. King\r\ncollected all the castings subsequently ejected on the same square foot\r\nof surface, and they weighed 2½ oz., or 1 lb. 6½ oz. per square yard.\r\nTherefore within about ten months, or we will say for safety’s sake\r\nwithin a year, 12 oz. of castings were thrown up on this one square foot,\r\nor 6.75 pounds on the square yard; and this would give 14.58 tons per\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nIn a field at the bottom of a valley in the chalk (see No. 2 in the\r\nforegoing table), a square yard was measured at a spot where very large\r\ncastings abounded; they appeared, however, almost equally numerous in a\r\nfew other places.  These castings, which retained perfectly their\r\nvermiform shape, were collected; and they weighed when partially dried, 1\r\nlb. 13½ oz.  This field had been rolled with a heavy agricultural roller\r\nfifty-two days before, and this would certainly have flattened every\r\nsingle casting on the land.  The weather had been very dry for two or\r\nthree weeks before the day of collection, so that not one casting\r\nappeared fresh or had been recently ejected.  We may therefore assume\r\nthat those which were weighed had been ejected within, we will say, forty\r\ndays from the time when the field was rolled,—that is, twelve days short\r\nof the whole intervening period.  I had examined the same part of the\r\nfield shortly before it was rolled, and it then abounded with fresh\r\ncastings.  Worms do not work in dry weather during the summer, or in\r\nwinter during severe frosts.  If we assume that they work for only half\r\nthe year—though this is too low an estimate—then the worms in this field\r\nwould eject during the year, 8.387 pounds per square yard; or 18.12 tons\r\nper acre, assuming the whole surface to be equally productive in\r\ncastings.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases some of the necessary data had to be estimated,\r\nbut in the two following cases the results are much more trustworthy.  A\r\nlady, on whose accuracy I can implicitly rely, offered to collect during\r\na year all the castings thrown up on two separate square yards, near\r\nLeith Hill Place, in Surrey.  The amount collected was, however, somewhat\r\nless than that originally ejected by the worms; for, as I have repeatedly\r\nobserved, a good deal of the finest earth is washed away, whenever\r\ncastings are thrown up during or shortly before heavy rain.  Small\r\nportions also adhered to the surrounding blades of grass, and it required\r\ntoo much time to detach every one of them.\r\n\r\nOn sandy soil, as in the present instance, castings are liable to crumble\r\nafter dry weather, and particles were thus often lost.  The lady also\r\noccasionally left home for a week or two, and at such times the castings\r\nmust have suffered still greater loss from exposure to the weather.\r\nThese losses were, however, compensated to some extent by the collections\r\nhaving been made on one of the squares for four days, and on the other\r\nsquare for two days more than the year.\r\n\r\nA space was selected (October 9th, 1870) for one of the squares on a\r\nbroad, grass-covered terrace, which had been mowed and swept during many\r\nyears.  It faced the south, but was shaded during part of the day by\r\ntrees.  It had been formed at least a century ago by a great accumulation\r\nof small and large fragments of sandstone, together with some sandy\r\nearth, rammed down level.  It is probable that it was at first protected\r\nby being covered with turf.  This terrace, judging from the number of\r\ncastings on it, was rather unfavourable for the existence of worms, in\r\ncomparison with the neighbouring fields and an upper terrace.  It was\r\nindeed surprising that as many worms could live here as were seen; for on\r\ndigging a hole in this terrace, the black vegetable mould together with\r\nthe turf was only four inches in thickness, beneath which lay the level\r\nsurface of light-coloured sandy soil, with many fragments of sandstone.\r\nBefore any castings were collected all the previously existing ones were\r\ncarefully removed.  The last day’s collection was on October 14th, 1871.\r\nThe castings were then well dried before a fire; and they weighed exactly\r\n3½ lbs.  This would give for an acre of similar land 7.56 tons of dry\r\nearth annually ejected by worms.\r\n\r\nThe second square was marked on unenclosed common land, at a height of\r\nabout 700 ft. above the sea, at some little distance from Leith Hill\r\nTower.  The surface was clothed with short, fine turf, and had never been\r\ndisturbed by the hand of man.  The spot selected appeared neither\r\nparticularly favourable nor the reverse for worms; but I have often\r\nnoticed that castings are especially abundant on common land, and this\r\nmay, perhaps, be attributed to the poorness of the soil.  The vegetable\r\nmould was here between three and four inches in thickness.  As this spot\r\nwas at some distance from the house where the lady lived, the castings\r\nwere not collected at such short intervals of time as those on the\r\nterrace; consequently the loss of fine earth during rainy weather must\r\nhave been greater in this than in the last case.  The castings moreover\r\nwere more sandy, and in collecting them during dry weather they sometimes\r\ncrumbled into dust, and much was thus lost.  Therefore it is certain that\r\nthe worms brought up to the surface considerably more earth than that\r\nwhich was collected.  The last collection was made on October 27th, 1871;\r\ni.e., 367 days after the square had been marked out and the surface\r\ncleared of all pre-existing castings.  The collected castings, after\r\nbeing well dried, weighed 7.453 pounds; and this would give, for an acre\r\nof the same kind of land, 16.1 tons of annually ejected dry earth.\r\n\r\n                 SUMMARY OF THE FOUR FOREGOING CASES.\r\n(1.)  Castings ejected near Nice within about a year, collected by Dr.\r\nKing on a square foot of surface, calculated to yield per acre 14.58\r\ntons.\r\n(2.)  Castings ejected during about 40 days on a square yard, in a\r\nfield of poor pasture at the bottom of a large valley in the Chalk,\r\ncalculated to yield annually per acre 18.12 tons.\r\n(3.)  Castings collected from a square yard on an old terrace at Leith\r\nHill Place, during 369 days, calculated to yield annually per acre\r\n7.56 tons.\r\n(4.)  Castings collected from a square yard on Leith Hill Common\r\nduring 367 days, calculated to yield annually per acre 16.1 tons.\r\n\r\n_The thickness of the layer of mould_, _which castings ejected during a\r\nyear would form if uniformly spread out_.—As we know, from the two last\r\ncases in the above summary, the weight of the dried castings ejected by\r\nworms during a year on a square yard of surface, I wished to learn how\r\nthick a layer of ordinary mould this amount would form if spread\r\nuniformly over a square yard.  The dry castings were therefore broken\r\ninto small particles, and whilst being placed in a measure were well\r\nshaken and pressed down.  Those collected on the Terrace amounted to\r\n124.77 cubic inches; and this amount, if spread out over a square yard,\r\nwould make a layer 0.9627 inch in thickness.  Those collected on the\r\nCommon amounted to 197.56 cubic inches, and would make a similar layer\r\n0.1524 inch in thickness.\r\n\r\nThese thicknesses must, however, be corrected, for the triturated\r\ncastings, after being well shaken down and pressed, did not make nearly\r\nso compact a mass as vegetable mould, though each separate particle was\r\nvery compact.  Yet mould is far from being compact, as is shown by the\r\nnumber of air-bubbles which rise up when the surface is flooded with\r\nwater.  It is moreover penetrated by many fine roots.  To ascertain\r\napproximately by how much ordinary vegetable mould would be increased in\r\nbulk by being broken up into small particles and then dried, a thin\r\noblong block of somewhat argillaceous mould (with the turf pared off) was\r\nmeasured before being broken up, was well dried and again measured.  The\r\ndrying caused it to shrink by 1/7 of its original bulk, judging from\r\nexterior measurements alone.  It was then triturated and partly reduced\r\nto powder, in the same manner as the castings had been treated, and its\r\nbulk now exceeded (notwithstanding shrinkage from drying) by 1/16 that of\r\nthe original block of damp mould.  Therefore the above calculated\r\nthickness of the layer, formed by the castings from the Terrace, after\r\nbeing damped and spread over a square yard, would have to be reduced by\r\n1/16; and this will reduce the layer to 0.09 of an inch, so that a layer\r\n0.9 inch in thickness would be formed in the course of ten years.  On the\r\nsame principle the castings from the Common would make in the course of a\r\nsingle year a layer 0.1429 inch, or in the course of 10 years 1.429 inch,\r\nin thickness.  We may say in round numbers that the thickness in the\r\nformer case would amount to nearly 1 inch, and in the second case to\r\nnearly 1½ inch in 10 years.\r\n\r\nIn order to compare these results with those deduced from the rates at\r\nwhich small objects left on the surfaces of grass-fields become buried\r\n(as described in the early part of this chapter), we will give the\r\nfollowing summary:—\r\n\r\n  SUMMARY OF THE THICKNESS OF THE MOULD ACCUMULATED OVER OBJECTS LEFT\r\n          STREWED ON THE SURFACE, IN THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS.\r\nThe accumulation of mould during 14¾ years on the surface of a dry,\r\nsandy, grass-field near Maer Hall, amounted to 2.2 inches in 10 years.\r\nThe accumulation during 21½ years on a swampy field near Maer Hall,\r\namounted to nearly 1.9 inch in 10 years.\r\nThe accumulation during 7 years on a very swampy field near Maer Hall\r\namounted to 2.1 inches in 10 years.\r\nThe accumulation during 29 years, on good, argillaceous pasture-land\r\nover the Chalk at Down, amounted to 2.2 inches in 10 years.\r\nThe accumulation during 30 years on the side of a valley over the\r\nChalk at Down, the soil being argillaceous, very poor, and only just\r\nconverted into pasture (so that it was for some years unfavourable for\r\nworms), amounted to 0.83 inch in 10 years.\r\n\r\nIn these cases (excepting the last) it may be seen that the amount of\r\nearth brought to the surface during 10 years is somewhat greater than\r\nthat calculated from the castings which were actually weighed.  This\r\nexcess may be partly accounted for by the loss which the weighed castings\r\nhad previously undergone through being washed by rain, by the adhesion of\r\nparticles to the blades of the surrounding grass, and by their crumbling\r\nwhen dry.  Nor must we overlook other agencies which in all ordinary\r\ncases add to the amount of mould, and which would not be included in the\r\ncastings that were collected, namely, the fine earth brought up to the\r\nsurface by burrowing larvæ and insects, especially by ants.  The earth\r\nbrought up by moles generally has a somewhat different appearance from\r\nvegetable mould; but after a time would not be distinguishable from it.\r\nIn dry countries, moreover, the wind plays an important part in carrying\r\ndust from one place to another, and even in England it must add to the\r\nmould on fields near great roads.  But in our country these latter\r\nseveral agencies appear to be of quite subordinate importance in\r\ncomparison with the action of worms.\r\n\r\nWe have no means of judging how great a weight of earth a single\r\nfull-sized worm ejects during a year.  Hensen estimates that 53,767 worms\r\nexist in an acre of land; but this is founded on the number found in\r\ngardens, and he believes that only about half as many live in\r\ncorn-fields.  How many live in old pasture land is unknown; but if we\r\nassume that half the above number, or 26,886 worms live on such land,\r\nthen taking from the previous summary 15 tons as the weight of the\r\ncastings annually thrown up on an acre of land, each worm must annually\r\neject 20 ounces.  A full-sized casting at the mouth of a single burrow\r\noften exceeds, as we have seen, an ounce in weight; and it is probable\r\nthat worms eject more than 20 full-sized castings during a year.  If they\r\neject annually more than 20 ounces, we may infer that the worms which\r\nlive in an acre of pasture land must be less than 26,886 in number.\r\n\r\nWorms live chiefly in the superficial mould, which is usually from 4 or 5\r\nto 10 and even 12 inches in thickness; and it is this mould which passes\r\nover and over again through their bodies and is brought to the surface.\r\nBut worms occasionally burrow into the subsoil to a much greater depth,\r\nand on such occasions they bring up earth from this greater depth; and\r\nthis process has gone on for countless ages.  Therefore the superficial\r\nlayer of mould would ultimately attain, though at a slower and slower\r\nrate, a thickness equal to the depth to which worms ever burrow, were\r\nthere not other opposing agencies at work which carry away to a lower\r\nlevel some of the finest earth which is continually being brought to the\r\nsurface by worms.  How great a thickness vegetable mould ever attains, I\r\nhave not had good opportunities for observing; but in the next chapter,\r\nwhen we consider the burial of ancient buildings, some facts will be\r\ngiven on this head.  In the two last chapters we shall see that the soil\r\nis actually increased, though only to a small degree, through the agency\r\nof worms; but their chief work is to sift the finer from the coarser\r\nparticles, to mingle the whole with vegetable débris, and to saturate it\r\nwith their intestinal secretions.\r\n\r\nFinally, no one who considers the facts given in this chapter—on the\r\nburying of small objects and on the sinking of great stones left on the\r\nsurface—on the vast number of worms which live within a moderate extent\r\nof ground on the weight of the castings ejected from the mouth of the\r\nsame burrow—on the weight of all the castings ejected within a known time\r\non a measured space—will hereafter, as I believe, doubt that worms play\r\nan important part in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nTHE PART WHICH WORMS HAVE PLAYED IN THE BURIAL OF ANCIENT BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of rubbish on the sites of great cities independent of\r\nthe action of worms—The burial of a Roman villa at Abinger—The floors and\r\nwalls penetrated by worms—Subsidence of a modern pavement—The buried\r\npavement at Beaulieu Abbey—Roman villas at Chedworth and Brading—The\r\nremains of the Roman town at Silchester—The nature of the débris by which\r\nthe remains are covered—The penetration of the tesselated floors and\r\nwalls by worms—Subsidence of the floors—Thickness of the mould—The old\r\nRoman city of Wroxeter—Thickness of the mould—Depth of the foundations of\r\nsome of the Buildings—Conclusion.\r\n\r\nARCHÆOLOGISTS are probably not aware how much they owe to worms for the\r\npreservation of many ancient objects.  Coins, gold ornaments, stone\r\nimplements, &c., if dropped on the surface of the ground, will infallibly\r\nbe buried by the castings of worms in a few years, and will thus be\r\nsafely preserved, until the land at some future time is turned up.  For\r\ninstance, many years ago a grass-field was ploughed on the northern side\r\nof the Severn, not far from Shrewsbury; and a surprising number of iron\r\narrow-heads were found at the bottom of the furrows, which, as Mr.\r\nBlakeway, a local antiquary, believed, were relics of the battle of\r\nShrewsbury in the year 1403, and no doubt had been originally left\r\nstrewed on the battle-field.  In the present chapter I shall show that\r\nnot only implements, &c., are thus preserved, but that the floors and the\r\nremains of many ancient buildings in England have been buried so\r\neffectually, in large part through the action of worms, that they have\r\nbeen discovered in recent times solely through various accidents.  The\r\nenormous beds of rubbish, several yards in thickness, which underlie many\r\ncities, such as Rome, Paris, and London, the lower ones being of great\r\nantiquity, are not here referred to, as they have not been in any way\r\nacted on by worms.  When we consider how much matter is daily brought\r\ninto a great city for building, fuel, clothing and food, and that in old\r\ntimes when the roads were bad and the work of the scavenger was\r\nneglected, a comparatively small amount was carried away, we may agree\r\nwith Élie de Beaumont, who, in discussing this subject, says, “pour une\r\nvoiture de matériaux qui en sort, on y en fait entrer cent.” {166a}  Nor\r\nshould we overlook the effects of fires, the demolition of old buildings,\r\nand the removal of rubbish to the nearest vacant space.\r\n\r\n_Abinger_, _Surrey_.—Late in the autumn of 1876, the ground in an old\r\nfarm-yard at this place was dug to a depth of 2 to 2½ feet, and the\r\nworkmen found various ancient remains.  This led Mr. T. H. Farrer of\r\nAbinger Hall to have an adjoining ploughed field searched.  On a trench\r\nbeing dug, a layer of concrete, still partly covered with tesseræ (small\r\nred tiles), and surrounded on two sides by broken-down walls, was soon\r\ndiscovered.  It is believed, {166b} that this room formed part of the\r\natrium or reception-room of a Roman villa.  The walls of two or three\r\nother small rooms were afterwards discovered.  Many fragments of pottery,\r\nother objects, and coins of several Roman emperors, dating from 133 to\r\n361, and perhaps to 375 A.D., were likewise found.  Also a half-penny of\r\nGeorge I., 1715.  The presence of this latter coin seems an anomaly; but\r\nno doubt it was dropped on the ground during the last century, and since\r\nthen there has been ample time for its burial under a considerable depth\r\nof the castings of worms.  From the different dates of the Roman coins we\r\nmay infer that the building was long inhabited.  It was probably ruined\r\nand deserted 1400 or 1500 years ago.\r\n\r\nI was present during the commencement of the excavations (August 20,\r\n1877) and Mr. Farrer had two deep trenches dug at opposite ends of the\r\natrium, so that I might examine the nature of the soil near the remains.\r\nThe field sloped from east to west at an angle of about 7°; and one of\r\nthe two trenches, shown in the accompanying section (Fig. 8) was at the\r\nupper or eastern end.  The diagram is on a scale of 1/20 of an inch to an\r\ninch; but the trench, which was between 4 and 5 feet broad, and in parts\r\nabove 5 feet deep, has necessarily been reduced out of all proportion.\r\nThe fine mould over the floor of the atrium varied in thickness from 11\r\nto 16 inches; and on the side of the trench in the section was a little\r\nover 13 inches.  After the mould had been removed, the floor appeared as\r\na whole moderately level; but it sloped in parts at an angle of 1°, and\r\nin one place near the outside at as much as 8° 30′.  The wall surrounding\r\nthe pavement was built of rough stones, and was 23 inches in thickness\r\nwhere the trench was dug.  Its broken summit was here 13 inches, but in\r\nanother part 15 inches, beneath the surface of the field, being covered\r\nby this thickness of mould.  In one spot, however, it rose to within 6\r\ninches of the surface.  On two sides of the room, where the junction of\r\nthe concrete floor with the bounding walls could be carefully examined,\r\nthere was no crack or separation.  This trench afterwards proved to have\r\nbeen dug within an adjoining room (11 ft. by 11 ft. 6 in. in size), the\r\nexistence of which was not even suspected whilst I was present.\r\n\r\n   [Picture: Fig. 8: Section through the foundations of a buried Roman\r\n                                  villa]\r\n\r\nOn the side of the trench farthest from the buried wall (W), the mould\r\nvaried from 9 to 14 inches in thickness; it rested on a mass (B) 23\r\ninches thick of blackish earth, including many large stones.  Beneath\r\nthis was a thin bed of very black mould (C), then a layer of earth full\r\nof fragments of mortar (D), and then another thin bed (about 3 inches\r\nthick) (E) of very black mould, which rested on the undisturbed subsoil\r\n(F) of firm, yellowish, argillaceous sand.  The 23-inch bed (B) was\r\nprobably made ground, as this would have brought up the floor of the room\r\nto a level with that of the atrium.  The two thin beds of black mould at\r\nthe bottom of the trench evidently marked two former land-surfaces.\r\nOutside the walls of the northern room, many bones, ashes, oyster-shells,\r\nbroken pottery and an entire pot were subsequently found at a depth of 16\r\ninches beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nThe second trench was dug on the western or lower side of the villa: the\r\nmould was here only 6½ inches in thickness, and it rested on a mass of\r\nfine earth full of stones, broken tiles and fragments of mortar, 34\r\ninches in thickness, beneath which was the undisturbed sand.  Most of\r\nthis earth had probably been washed down from the upper part of the\r\nfield, and the fragments of stones, tiles, &c., must have come from the\r\nimmediately adjoining ruins.\r\n\r\nIt appears at first sight a surprising fact that this field of light\r\nsandy soil should have been cultivated and ploughed during many years,\r\nand that not a vestige of these buildings should have been discovered.\r\nNo one even suspected that the remains of a Roman villa lay hidden close\r\nbeneath the surface.  But the fact is less surprising when it is known\r\nthat the field, as the bailiff believed, had never been ploughed to a\r\ngreater depth than 4 inches.  It is certain that when the land was first\r\nploughed, the pavement and the surrounding broken walls must have been\r\ncovered by at least 4 inches of soil, for otherwise the rotten concrete\r\nfloor would have been scored by the ploughshare, the tesseræ torn up, and\r\nthe tops of the old walls knocked down.\r\n\r\nWhen the concrete and tesseræ were first cleared over a space of 14 by 9\r\nft., the floor which was coated with trodden-down earth exhibited no\r\nsigns of having been penetrated by worms; and although the overlying fine\r\nmould closely resembled that which in many places has certainly been\r\naccumulated by worms, yet it seemed hardly possible that this mould could\r\nhave been brought up by worms from beneath the apparently sound floor.\r\nIt seemed also extremely improbable that the thick walls, surrounding the\r\nroom and still united to the concrete, had been undermined by worms, and\r\nhad thus been caused to sink, being afterwards covered up by their\r\ncastings.  I therefore at first concluded that all the fine mould above\r\nthe ruins had been washed down from the upper parts of the field; but we\r\nshall soon see that this conclusion was certainly erroneous, though much\r\nfine earth is known to be washed down from the upper part of the field in\r\nits present ploughed state during heavy rains.\r\n\r\nAlthough the concrete floor did not at first appear to have been anywhere\r\npenetrated by worms, yet by the next morning little cakes of the\r\ntrodden-down earth had been lifted up by worms over the mouths of seven\r\nburrows, which passed through the softer parts of the naked concrete, or\r\nbetween the interstices of the tesseræ.  On the third morning twenty-five\r\nburrows were counted; and by suddenly lifting up the little cakes of\r\nearth, four worms were seen in the act of quickly retreating.  Two\r\ncastings were thrown up during the third night on the floor, and these\r\nwere of large size.  The season was not favourable for the full activity\r\nof worms, and the weather had lately been hot and dry, so that most of\r\nthe worms now lived at a considerable depth.  In digging the two trenches\r\nmany open burrows and some worms were encountered at between 30 and 40\r\ninches beneath the surface; but at a greater depth they became rare.  One\r\nworm, however, was cut through at 48½, and another at 51½ inches beneath\r\nthe surface.  A fresh humus-lined burrow was also met with at a depth of\r\n57 and another at 65½ inches.  At greater depths than this, neither\r\nburrows nor worms were seen.\r\n\r\nAs I wished to learn how many worms lived beneath the floor of the\r\natrium—a space of about 14 by 9 feet—Mr. Farrer was so kind as to make\r\nobservations for me, during the next seven weeks, by which time the worms\r\nin the surrounding country were in full activity, and were working near\r\nthe surface.  It is very improbable that worms should have migrated from\r\nthe adjoining field into the small space of the atrium, after the\r\nsuperficial mould in which they prefer to live, had been removed.  We may\r\ntherefore conclude that the burrows and the castings which were seen here\r\nduring the ensuing seven weeks were the work of the former inhabitants of\r\nthe space.  I will now give a few extracts from Mr. Farrer’s notes.\r\n\r\nAug. 26th, 1877; that is, five days after the floor had been cleared.  On\r\nthe previous night there had been some heavy rain, which washed the\r\nsurface clean, and now the mouths of forty burrows were counted.  Parts\r\nof the concrete were seen to be solid, and had never been penetrated by\r\nworms, and here the rain-water lodged.\r\n\r\nSept. 5th.—Tracks of worms, made during the previous night, could be seen\r\non the surface of the floor, and five or six vermiform castings had been\r\nthrown up.  These were defaced.\r\n\r\nSept. 12th.—During the last six days, the worms have not been active,\r\nthough many castings have been ejected in the neighbouring fields; but on\r\nthis day the earth was a little raised over the mouths of the burrows, or\r\ncastings were ejected, at ten fresh points.  These were defaced.  It\r\nshould be understood that when a fresh burrow is spoken of, this\r\ngenerally means only that an old burrow has been re-opened.  Mr. Farrer\r\nwas repeatedly struck with the pertinacity with which the worms re-opened\r\ntheir old burrows, even when no earth was ejected from them.  I have\r\noften observed the same fact, and generally the mouths of the burrows are\r\nprotected by an accumulation of pebbles, sticks or leaves.  Mr. Farrer\r\nlikewise observed that the worms living beneath the floor of the atrium\r\noften collected coarse grains of sand, and such little stones as they\r\ncould find, round the mouths of their burrows.\r\n\r\nSept. 13th; soft wet weather.  The mouths of the burrows were re-opened,\r\nor castings were ejected, at 31 points; these were all defaced.\r\n\r\nSept. 14th; 34 fresh holes or castings; all defaced.\r\n\r\nSept. 15th; 44 fresh holes, only 5 castings; all defaced.\r\n\r\nSept. 18th; 43 fresh holes, 8 castings; all defaced.\r\n\r\nThe number of castings on the surrounding fields was now very large.\r\n\r\nSept. 19th; 40 holes, 8 castings; all defaced.\r\n\r\nSept. 22nd; 43 holes, only a few fresh castings; all defaced.\r\n\r\nSept. 23rd; 44 holes, 8 castings.\r\n\r\nSept. 25th; 50 holes, no record of the number of castings.\r\n\r\nOct. 13th;  61 holes, no record of the number of castings.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of three years, Mr. Farrer, at my request, again looked\r\nat the concrete floor, and found the worms still at work.\r\n\r\nKnowing what great muscular power worms possess, and seeing how soft the\r\nconcrete was in many parts, I was not surprised at its having been\r\npenetrated by their burrows; but it is a more surprising fact that the\r\nmortar between the rough stones of the thick walls, surrounding the\r\nrooms, was found by Mr. Farrer to have been penetrated by worms.  On\r\nAugust 26th, that is, five days after the ruins had been exposed, he\r\nobserved four open burrows on the broken summit of the eastern wall (W in\r\nFig. 8); and, on September 15th, other burrows similarly situated were\r\nseen.  It should also be noted that in the perpendicular side of the\r\ntrench (which was much deeper than is represented in Fig. 8) three recent\r\nburrows were seen, which ran obliquely far down beneath the base of the\r\nold wall.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that many worms lived beneath the floor and the walls of the\r\natrium at the time when the excavations were made; and that they\r\nafterwards almost daily brought up earth to the surface from a\r\nconsiderable depth.  There is not the slightest reason to doubt that\r\nworms have acted in this manner ever since the period when the concrete\r\nwas sufficiently decayed to allow them to penetrate it; and even before\r\nthat period they would have lived beneath the floor, as soon as it became\r\npervious to rain, so that the soil beneath was kept damp.  The floor and\r\nthe walls must therefore have been continually undermined; and fine earth\r\nmust have been heaped on them during many centuries, perhaps for a\r\nthousand years.  If the burrows beneath the floor and walls, which it is\r\nprobable were formerly as numerous as they now are, had not collapsed in\r\nthe course of time in the manner formerly explained, the underlying earth\r\nwould have been riddled with passages like a sponge; and as this was not\r\nthe case, we may feel sure that they have collapsed.  The inevitable\r\nresult of such collapsing during successive centuries, will have been the\r\nslow subsidence of the floor and of the walls, and their burial beneath\r\nthe accumulated worm-castings.  The subsidence of a floor, whilst it\r\nstill remains nearly horizontal, may at first appear improbable; but the\r\ncase presents no more real difficulty than that of loose objects strewed\r\non the surface of a field, which, as we have seen, become buried several\r\ninches beneath the surface in the course of a few years, though still\r\nforming a horizontal layer parallel to the surface.  The burial of the\r\npaved and level path on my lawn, which took place under my own\r\nobservation, is an analogous case.  Even those parts of the concrete\r\nfloor which the worms could not penetrate would almost certainly have\r\nbeen undermined, and would have sunk, like the great stones at Leith Hill\r\nPlace and Stonehenge, for the soil would have been damp beneath them.\r\nBut the rate of sinking of the different parts would not have been quite\r\nequal, and the floor was not quite level.  The foundations of the\r\nboundary walls lie, as shown in the section, at a very small depth\r\nbeneath the surface; they would therefore have tended to subside at\r\nnearly the same rate as the floor.  But this would not have occurred if\r\nthe foundations had been deep, as in the case of some other Roman ruins\r\npresently to be described.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may infer that a large part of the fine vegetable mould,\r\nwhich covered the floor and the broken-down walls of this villa, in some\r\nplaces to a thickness of 16 inches, was brought up from below by worms.\r\nFrom facts hereafter to be given there can be no doubt that some of the\r\nfinest earth thus brought up will have been washed down the sloping\r\nsurface of the field during every heavy shower of rain.  If this had not\r\noccurred a greater amount of mould would have accumulated over the ruins\r\nthan that now present.  But beside the castings of worms and some earth\r\nbrought up by insects, and some accumulation of dust, much fine earth\r\nwill have been washed over the ruins from the upper parts of the field,\r\nsince it has been under cultivation; and from over the ruins to the lower\r\nparts of the slope; the present thickness of the mould being the\r\nresultant of these several agencies.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nI may here append a modern instance of the sinking of a pavement,\r\ncommunicated to me in 1871 by Mr. Ramsay, Director of the Geological\r\nSurvey of England.  A passage without a roof, 7 feet in length by 3 feet\r\n2 inches in width, led from his house into the garden, and was paved with\r\nslabs of Portland stone.  Several of these slabs were 16 inches square,\r\nothers larger, and some a little smaller.  This pavement had subsided\r\nabout 3 inches along the middle of the passage, and two inches on each\r\nside, as could be seen by the lines of cement by which the slabs had been\r\noriginally joined to the walls.  The pavement had thus become slightly\r\nconcave along the middle; but there was no subsidence at the end close to\r\nthe house.  Mr. Ramsay could not account for this sinking, until he\r\nobserved that castings of black mould were frequently ejected along the\r\nlines of junction between the slabs; and these castings were regularly\r\nswept away.  The several lines of junction, including those with the\r\nlateral walls, were altogether 39 feet 2 inches in length.  The pavement\r\ndid not present the appearance of ever having been renewed, and the house\r\nwas believed to have been built about eighty-seven years ago.\r\nConsidering all these circumstances, Mr. Ramsay does not doubt that the\r\nearth brought up by the worms since the pavement was first laid down, or\r\nrather since the decay of the mortar allowed the worms to burrow through\r\nit, and therefore within a much shorter time than the eighty-seven years,\r\nhas sufficed to cause the sinking of the pavement to the above amount,\r\nexcept close to the house, where the ground beneath would have been kept\r\nnearly dry.\r\n\r\nBeaulieu Abbey, Hampshire.—This abbey was destroyed by Henry VIII., and\r\nthere now remains only a portion of the southern aisle-wall.  It is\r\nbelieved that the king had most of the stones carried away for building a\r\ncastle; and it is certain that they have been removed.  The positions of\r\nthe nave and transepts were ascertained not long ago by the foundations\r\nhaving been found; and the place is now marked by stones let into the\r\nground.  Where the abbey formerly stood, there now extends a smooth\r\ngrass-covered surface, which resembles in all respects the rest of the\r\nfield.  The guardian, a very old man, said the surface had never been\r\nlevelled in his time.  In the year 1853, the Duke of Buccleuch had three\r\nholes dug in the turf within a few yards of one another, at the western\r\nend of the nave; and the old tesselated pavement of the abbey was thus\r\ndiscovered.  These holes were afterwards surrounded by brickwork, and\r\nprotected by trap-doors, so that the pavement might be readily inspected\r\nand preserved.  When my son William examined the place on January 5,\r\n1872, he found that the pavement in the three holes lay at depths of 6¾,\r\n10 and 11½ inches beneath the surrounding turf-covered surface.  The old\r\nguardian asserted that he was often forced to remove worm-castings from\r\nthe pavement; and that he had done so about six months before.  My son\r\ncollected all from one of the holes, the area of which was 5.32 square\r\nfeet, and they weighed 7.97 ounces.  Assuming that this amount had\r\naccumulated in six months, the accumulation during a year on a square\r\nyard would be 1.68 pounds, which, though a large amount, is very small\r\ncompared with what, as we have seen, is often ejected on fields and\r\ncommons.  When I visited the abbey on June 22, 1877, the old man said\r\nthat he had cleared out the holes about a month before, but a good many\r\ncastings had since been ejected.  I suspect that he imagined that he\r\nswept the pavements oftener than he really did, for the conditions were\r\nin several respects very unfavourable for the accumulation of even a\r\nmoderate amount of castings.  The tiles are rather large, viz., about 5½\r\ninches square, and the mortar between them was in most places sound, so\r\nthat the worms were able to bring up earth from below only at certain\r\npoints.  The tiles rested on a bed of concrete, and the castings in\r\nconsequence consisted in large part (viz., in the proportion of 19 to 33)\r\nof particles of mortar, grains of sand, little fragments of rock, bricks\r\nor tile; and such substances could hardly be agreeable, and certainly not\r\nnutritious, to worms.\r\n\r\nMy son dug holes in several places within the former walls of the abbey,\r\nat a distance of several yards from the above described bricked squares.\r\nHe did not find any tiles, though these are known to occur in some other\r\nparts, but he came in one spot to concrete on which tiles had once\r\nrested.  The fine mould beneath the turf on the sides of the several\r\nholes, varied in thickness from only 2 to 2¾ inches, and this rested on a\r\nlayer from 8¾ to above 11 inches in thickness, consisting of fragments of\r\nmortar and stone-rubbish with the interstices compactly filled up with\r\nblack mould.  In the surrounding field, at a distance of 20 yards from\r\nthe abbey, the fine vegetable mould was 11 inches thick.\r\n\r\nWe may conclude from these facts that when the abbey was destroyed and\r\nthe stones removed, a layer of rubbish was left over the whole surface,\r\nand that as soon as the worms were able to penetrate the decayed concrete\r\nand the joints between the tiles, they slowly filled up the interstices\r\nin the overlying rubbish with their castings, which were afterwards\r\naccumulated to a thickness of nearly three inches over the whole surface.\r\nIf we add to this latter amount the mould between the fragments of\r\nstones, some five or six inches of mould must have been brought up from\r\nbeneath the concrete or tiles.  The concrete or tiles will consequently\r\nhave subsided to nearly this amount.  The bases of the columns of the\r\naisles are now buried beneath mould and turf.  It is not probable that\r\nthey can have been undermined by worms, for their foundations would no\r\ndoubt have been laid at a considerable depth.  If they have not subsided,\r\nthe stones of which the columns were constructed must have been removed\r\nfrom beneath the former level of the floor.\r\n\r\n_Chedworth_, _Gloucestershire_.—The remains of a large Roman villa were\r\ndiscovered here in 1866, on ground which had been covered with wood from\r\ntime immemorial.  No suspicion seems ever to have been entertained that\r\nancient buildings lay buried here, until a gamekeeper, in digging for\r\nrabbits, encountered some remains. {183}  But subsequently the tops of\r\nsome stone walls were detected in parts of the wood, projecting a little\r\nabove the surface of the ground.  Most of the coins found here belonged\r\nto Constans (who died 350 A.D.) and the Constantine family.  My sons\r\nFrancis and Horace visited the place in November 1877, for the sake of\r\nascertaining what part worms may have played in the burial of these\r\nextensive remains.  But the circumstances were not favourable for this\r\nobject, as the ruins are surrounded on three sides by rather steep banks,\r\ndown which earth is washed during rainy weather.  Moreover most of the\r\nold rooms have been covered with roofs, for the protection of the elegant\r\ntesselated pavements.\r\n\r\nA few facts may, however, be given on the thickness of the soil over\r\nthese ruins.  Close outside the northern rooms there is a broken wall,\r\nthe summit of which was covered by 5 inches of black mould; and in a hole\r\ndug on the outer side of this wall, where the ground had never before\r\nbeen disturbed, black mould, full of stones, 26 inches in thickness, was\r\nfound, resting on the undisturbed sub-soil of yellow clay.  At a depth of\r\n22 inches from the surface a pig’s jaw and a fragment of a tile were\r\nfound.  When the excavations were first made, some large trees grew over\r\nthe ruins; and the stump of one has been left directly over a party-wall\r\nnear the bath-room, for the sake of showing the thickness of the\r\nsuperincumbent soil, which was here 38 inches.  In one small room, which,\r\nafter being cleared out, had not been roofed over, my sons observed the\r\nhole of a worm passing through the rotten concrete, and a living worm was\r\nfound within the concrete.  In another open room worm-castings were seen\r\non the floor, over which some earth had by this means been deposited, and\r\nhere grass now grew.\r\n\r\n_Brading_, _Isle of Wight_.—A fine Roman villa was discovered here in\r\n1880; and by the end of October no less than 18 chambers had been more or\r\nless cleared.  A coin dated 337 A.D. was found.  My son William visited\r\nthe place before the excavations were completed; and he informs me that\r\nmost of the floors were at first covered with much rubbish and fallen\r\nstones, having their interstices completely filled up with mould,\r\nabounding, as the workmen said, with worms, above which there was mould\r\nwithout any stones.  The whole mass was in most places from 3 to above 4\r\nft. in thickness.  In one very large room the overlying earth was only 2\r\nft. 6 in. thick; and after this had been removed, so many castings were\r\nthrown up between the tiles that the surface had to be almost daily\r\nswept.  Most of the floors were fairly level.  The tops of the\r\nbroken-down walls were covered in some places by only 4 or 5 inches of\r\nsoil, so that they were occasionally struck by the plough, but in other\r\nplaces they were covered by from 13 to 18 inches of soil.  It is not\r\nprobable that these walls could have been undermined by worms and\r\nsubsided, as they rested on a foundation of very hard red sand, into\r\nwhich worms could hardly burrow.  The mortar, however, between the stones\r\nof the walls of a hypocaust was found by my son to have been penetrated\r\nby many worm-burrows.  The remains of this villa stand on land which\r\nslopes at an angle of about 3°; and the land appears to have been long\r\ncultivated.  Therefore no doubt a considerable quantity of fine earth has\r\nbeen washed down from the upper parts of the field, and has largely aided\r\nin the burial of these remains.\r\n\r\n_Silchester_, _Hampshire_.—The ruins of this small Roman town have been\r\nbetter preserved than any other remains of the kind in England.  A broken\r\nwall, in most parts from 15 to 18 feet in height and about 1½ mile in\r\ncompass, now surrounds a space of about 100 acres of cultivated land, on\r\nwhich a farm-house and a church stand. {187}  Formerly, when the weather\r\nwas dry, the lines of the buried walls could be traced by the appearance\r\nof the crops; and recently very extensive excavations have been\r\nundertaken by the Duke of Wellington, under the superintendence of the\r\nlate Rev. J. G. Joyce, by which means many large buildings have been\r\ndiscovered.  Mr. Joyce made careful coloured sections, and measured the\r\nthickness of each bed of rubbish, whilst the excavations were in\r\nprogress; and he has had the kindness to send me copies of several of\r\nthem.  When my sons Francis and Horace visited these ruins, he\r\naccompanied them, and added his notes to theirs.\r\n\r\nMr. Joyce estimates that the town was inhabited by the Romans for about\r\nthree centuries; and no doubt much matter must have accumulated within\r\nthe walls during this long period.  It appears to have been destroyed by\r\nfire, and most of the stones used in the buildings have since been\r\ncarried away.  These circumstances are unfavourable for ascertaining the\r\npart which worms have played in the burial of the ruins; but as careful\r\nsections of the rubbish overlying an ancient town have seldom or never\r\nbefore been made in England, I will give copies of the most\r\ncharacteristic portions of some of those made by Mr. Joyce.  They are of\r\ntoo great length to be here introduced entire.\r\n\r\nAn east and west section, 30 ft. in length, was made across a room in the\r\nBasilica, now called the Hall of the Merchants (Fig. 9).  The hard\r\nconcrete floor, still covered here and there with tesseræ, was found at 3\r\nft. beneath the surface of the field, which was here level.  On the floor\r\nthere were two large piles of charred wood, one alone of which is shown\r\nin the part of the section here given.  This pile was covered by a thin\r\nwhite layer of decayed stucco or plaster, above which was a mass,\r\npresenting a singularly disturbed appearance, of broken tiles, mortar,\r\nrubbish and fine gravel, together 27 inches in thickness.  Mr. Joyce\r\nbelieves that the gravel was used in making the mortar or concrete, which\r\nhas since decayed, some of the lime probably having been dissolved.  The\r\ndisturbed state of the rubbish may have been due to its having been\r\nsearched for building stones.  This bed was capped by fine vegetable\r\nmould, 9 inches in thickness.  From these facts we may conclude that the\r\nHall was burnt down, and that much rubbish fell on the floor, through and\r\nfrom which the worms slowly brought up the mould, now forming the surface\r\nof the level field.\r\n\r\n [Picture: Fig. 7: Section through one of the fallen Druidical stones at\r\nStonehenge.  Fig. 9: Section within a room in the Basilica at Silchester]\r\n\r\nA section across the middle of another hall in the Basilica, 32 feet 6\r\ninches in length, called the Ærarium, is shown in Fig. 10.  It appears\r\nthat we have here evidence of two fires, separated by an interval of\r\ntime, during which the 6 inches of “mortar and concrete with broken\r\ntiles” was accumulated.  Beneath one of the layers of charred wood, a\r\nvaluable relic, a bronze eagle, was found; and this shows that the\r\nsoldiers must have deserted the place in a panic.  Owing to the death of\r\nMr. Joyce, I have not been able to ascertain beneath which of the two\r\nlayers the eagle was found.  The bed of rubble overlying the undisturbed\r\ngravel originally formed, as I suppose, the floor, for it stands on a\r\nlevel with that of a corridor, outside the walls of the Hall; but the\r\ncorridor is not shown in the section as here given.  The vegetable mould\r\nwas 16 inches thick in the thickest part; and the depth from the surface\r\nof the field, clothed with herbage, to the undisturbed gravel, was 40\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n [Picture: Fig. 10: Section within a hall in the Basilica of Silchester]\r\n\r\nThe section shown in Fig. 11 represents an excavation made in the middle\r\nof the town, and is here introduced because the bed of “rich mould”\r\nattained, according to Mr. Joyce, the unusual thickness of 20 inches.\r\nGravel lay at the depth of 48 inches from the surface; but it was not\r\nascertained whether this was in its natural state, or had been brought\r\nhere and had been rammed down, as occurs in some other places.\r\n\r\n [Picture: Fig. 11: Section in a block of buildings in the middle of the\r\n                           town of Silchester]\r\n\r\nThe section shown in Fig. 12 was taken in the centre of the Basilica, and\r\nthough it was 5 feet in depth, the natural sub-soil was not reached.  The\r\nbed marked “concrete” was probably at one time a floor; and the beds\r\nbeneath seem to be the remnants of more ancient buildings.  The vegetable\r\nmould was here only 9 inches thick.  In some other sections, not copied,\r\nwe likewise have evidence of buildings having been erected over the ruins\r\nof older ones.  In one case there was a layer of yellow clay of very\r\nunequal thickness between two beds of débris, the lower one of which\r\nrested on a floor with tesseræ.  The ancient broken walls appear to have\r\nbeen sometimes roughly cut down to a uniform level, so as to serve as the\r\nfoundations for a temporary building; and Mr. Joyce suspects that some of\r\nthese buildings were wattled sheds, plastered with clay, which would\r\naccount for the above-mentioned layer of clay.\r\n\r\n [Picture: Fig. 12: Section in the centre of the Basilica at Silchester]\r\n\r\nTurning now to the points which more immediately concern us.\r\nWorm-castings were observed on the floors of several of the rooms, in one\r\nof which the tesselation was unusually perfect.  The tesseræ here\r\nconsisted of little cubes of hard sandstone of about 1 inch, several of\r\nwhich were loose or projected slightly above the general level.  One or\r\noccasionally two open worm-burrows were found beneath all the loose\r\ntesseræ.  Worms have also penetrated the old walls of these ruins.  A\r\nwall, which had just been exposed to view during the excavations then in\r\nprogress, was examined; it was built of large flints, and was 18 inches\r\nin thickness.  It appeared sound, but when the soil was removed from\r\nbeneath, the mortar in the lower part was found to be so much decayed\r\nthat the flints fell apart from their own weight.  Here, in the middle of\r\nthe wall, at a depth of 29 inches beneath the old floor and of 49½ inches\r\nbeneath the surface of the field, a living worm was found, and the mortar\r\nwas penetrated by several burrows.\r\n\r\nA second wall was exposed to view for the first time, and an open burrow\r\nwas seen on its broken summit.  By separating the flints this burrow was\r\ntraced far down in the interior of the wall; but as some of the flints\r\ncohered firmly, the whole mass was disturbed in pulling down the wall,\r\nand the burrow could not be traced to the bottom.  The foundations of a\r\nthird wall, which appeared quite sound, lay at a depth of 4 feet beneath\r\none of the floors, and of course at a considerably greater depth beneath\r\nthe level of the ground.  A large flint was wrenched out of the wall at\r\nabout a foot from the base, and this required much force, as the mortar\r\nwas sound; but behind the flint in the middle of the wall, the mortar was\r\nfriable, and here there were worm-burrows.  Mr. Joyce and my sons were\r\nsurprised at the blackness of the mortar in this and in several other\r\ncases, and at the presence of mould in the interior of the walls.  Some\r\nmay have been placed there by the old builders instead of mortar; but we\r\nshould remember that worms line their burrows with black humus.  Moreover\r\nopen spaces would almost certainly have been occasionally left between\r\nthe large irregular flints; and these spaces, we may feel sure, would be\r\nfilled up by the worms with their castings, as soon as they were able to\r\npenetrate the wall.  Rain-water, oozing down the burrows would also carry\r\nfine dark-coloured particles into every crevice.  Mr. Joyce was at first\r\nvery sceptical about the amount of work which I attributed to worms; but\r\nhe ends his notes with reference to the last-mentioned wall by saying,\r\n“This case caused me more surprise and brought more conviction to me than\r\nany other.  I should have said, and did say, that it was quite impossible\r\nsuch a wall could have been penetrated by earth-worms.”\r\n\r\nIn almost all the rooms the pavement has sunk considerably, especially\r\ntowards the middle; and this is shown in the three following sections.\r\nThe measurements were made by stretching a string tightly and\r\nhorizontally over the floor.  The section, Fig. 13, was taken from north\r\nto south across a room, 18 feet 4 inches in length, with a nearly perfect\r\npavement, next to the “Red Wooden Hut.”  In the northern half, the\r\nsubsidence amounted to 5¾ inches beneath the level of the floor as it now\r\nstands close to the walls; and it was greater in the northern than in the\r\nsouthern half; but, according to Mr. Joyce, the entire pavement has\r\nobviously subsided.  In several places, the tesseræ appeared as if drawn\r\na little away from the walls; whilst in other places they were still in\r\nclose contact with them.\r\n\r\n [Picture: Fig. 14: A north and south section through the subsided floor\r\n                              of a corridor]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 14, we see a section across the paved floor of the southern\r\ncorridor or ambulatory of a quadrangle, in an excavation made near “The\r\nSpring.”  The floor is 7 feet 9 inches wide, and the broken-down walls\r\nnow project only ¾ of an inch above its level.  The field, which was in\r\npasture, here sloped from north to south, at an angle of 30°, 40′.  The\r\nnature of the ground at some little distance on each side of the corridor\r\nis shown in the section.  It consisted of earth full of stones and other\r\ndébris, capped with dark vegetable mould which was thicker on the lower\r\nor southern than on the northern side.  The pavement was nearly level\r\nalong lines parallel to the side-walls, but had sunk in the middle as\r\nmuch as 7¾ inches.\r\n\r\nA small room at no great distance from that represented in Fig. 13, had\r\nbeen enlarged by the Roman occupier on the southern side, by an addition\r\nof 5 feet 4 inches in breadth.  For this purpose the southern wall of the\r\nhouse had been pulled down, but the foundations of the old wall had been\r\nleft buried at a little depth beneath the pavement of the enlarged room.\r\nMr. Joyce believes that this buried wall must have been built before the\r\nreign of Claudius II., who died 270 A.D.  We see in the accompanying\r\nsection, Fig. 15, that the tesselated pavement has subsided to a less\r\ndegree over the buried wall than elsewhere; so that a slight convexity or\r\nprotuberance here stretched in a straight line across the room.  This led\r\nto a hole being dug, and the buried wall was thus discovered.\r\n\r\n          [Picture: Fig. 15: Section through the subsided floor]\r\n\r\nWe see in these three sections, and in several others not given, that the\r\nold pavements have sunk or sagged considerably.  Mr. Joyce formerly\r\nattributed this sinking solely to the slow settling of the ground.  That\r\nthere has been some settling is highly probable, and it may be seen in\r\nFig. 15 that the pavement for a width of 5 feet over the southern\r\nenlargement of the room, which must have been built on fresh ground, has\r\nsunk a little more than on the old northern side.  But this sinking may\r\npossibly have had no connection with the enlargement of the room; for in\r\nFig. 13 one half of the pavement has subsided more than the other half\r\nwithout any assignable cause.  In a bricked passage to Mr. Joyce’s own\r\nhouse, laid down only about six years ago, the same kind of sinking has\r\noccurred as in the ancient buildings.  Nevertheless it does not appear\r\nprobable that the whole amount of sinking can be thus accounted for.  The\r\nRoman builders excavated the ground to an unusual depth for the\r\nfoundations of their walls, which were thick and solid; it is therefore\r\nhardly credible that they should have been careless about the solidity of\r\nthe bed on which their tesselated and often ornamented pavements were\r\nlaid.  The sinking must, as it appears to me, be attributed in chief part\r\nto the pavement having been undermined by worms, which we know are still\r\nat work.  Even Mr. Joyce at last admitted that this could not have failed\r\nto have produced a considerable effect.  Thus also the large quantity of\r\nfine mould overlying the pavements can be accounted for, the presence of\r\nwhich would otherwise be inexplicable.  My sons noticed that in one room\r\nin which the pavement had sagged very little, there was an unusually\r\nsmall amount of overlying mould.\r\n\r\nAs the foundations of the walls generally lie at a considerable depth,\r\nthey will either have not subsided at all through the undermining action\r\nof worms, or they will have subsided much less than the floor.  This\r\nlatter result would follow from worms not often working deep down beneath\r\nthe foundations; but more especially from the walls not yielding when\r\npenetrated by worms, whereas the successively formed burrows in a mass of\r\nearth, equal to one of the walls in depth and thickness, would have\r\ncollapsed many times since the desertion of the ruins, and would\r\nconsequently have shrunk or subsided.  As the walls cannot have sunk much\r\nor at all, the immediately adjoining pavement from adhering to them will\r\nhave been prevented from subsiding; and thus the present curvature of the\r\npavement is intelligible.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance which has surprised me most with respect to Silchester\r\nis that during the many centuries which have elapsed since the old\r\nbuildings were deserted, the vegetable mould has not accumulated over\r\nthem to a greater thickness than that here observed.  In most places it\r\nis only about 9 inches in thickness, but in some places 12 or even more\r\ninches.  In Fig. 11, it is given as 20 inches, but this section was drawn\r\nby Mr. Joyce before his attention was particularly called to this\r\nsubject.  The land enclosed within the old walls is described as sloping\r\nslightly to the south; but there are parts which, according to Mr. Joyce,\r\nare nearly level, and it appears that the mould is here generally thicker\r\nthan elsewhere.  The surface slopes in other parts from west to east, and\r\nMr. Joyce describes one floor as covered at the western end by rubbish\r\nand mould to a thickness of 28½ inches, and at the eastern end by a\r\nthickness of only 11½ inches.  A very slight slope suffices to cause\r\nrecent castings to flow downwards during heavy rain, and thus much earth\r\nwill ultimately reach the neighbouring rills and streams and be carried\r\naway.  By this means, the absence of very thick beds of mould over these\r\nancient ruins may, as I believe, be explained.  Moreover most of the land\r\nhere has long been ploughed, and this would greatly aid the washing away\r\nof the finer earth during rainy weather.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the beds immediately beneath the vegetable mould in some of\r\nthe sections is rather perplexing.  We see, for instance, in the section\r\nof an excavation in a grass meadow (Fig. 14), which sloped from north to\r\nsouth at an angle of 3° 40′, that the mould on the upper side is only six\r\ninches and on the lower side nine inches in thickness.  But this mould\r\nlies on a mass (25½ inches in thickness on the upper side) “of dark brown\r\nmould,” as described by Mr. Joyce, “thickly interspersed with small\r\npebbles and bits of tiles, which present a corroded or worn appearance.”\r\nThe state of this dark-coloured earth is like that of a field which has\r\nlong been ploughed, for the earth thus becomes intermingled with stones\r\nand fragments of all kinds which have been much exposed to the weather.\r\nIf during the course of many centuries this grass meadow and the other\r\nnow cultivated fields have been at times ploughed, and at other times\r\nleft as pasture, the nature of the ground in the above section is\r\nrendered intelligible.  For worms will continually have brought up fine\r\nearth from below, which will have been stirred up by the plough whenever\r\nthe land was cultivated.  But after a time a greater thickness of fine\r\nearth will thus have been accumulated than could be reached by the\r\nplough; and a bed like the 25½-inch mass, in Fig. 14, will have been\r\nformed beneath the superficial mould, which latter will have been brought\r\nto the surface within more recent times, and have been well sifted by the\r\nworms.\r\n\r\n_Wroxeter_, _Shropshire_.—The old Roman city of Uriconium was founded in\r\nthe early part of the second century, if not before this date; and it was\r\ndestroyed, according to Mr. Wright, probably between the middle of the\r\nfourth and fifth century.  The inhabitants were massacred, and skeletons\r\nof women were found in the hypocausts.  Before the year 1859, the sole\r\nremnant of the city above ground, was a portion of a massive wall about\r\n20 ft. in height.  The surrounding land undulates slightly, and has long\r\nbeen under cultivation.  It had been noticed that the corn-crops ripened\r\nprematurely in certain narrow lines, and that the snow remained unmelted\r\nin certain places longer than in others.  These appearances led, as I was\r\ninformed, to extensive excavations being undertaken.  The foundations of\r\nmany large buildings and several streets have thus been exposed to view.\r\nThe space enclosed within the old walls is an irregular oval, about 1¾\r\nmile in length.  Many of the stones or bricks used in the buildings must\r\nhave been carried away; but the hypocausts, baths, and other underground\r\nbuildings were found tolerably perfect, being filled with stones, broken\r\ntiles, rubbish and soil.  The old floors of various rooms were covered\r\nwith rubble.  As I was anxious to know how thick the mantle of mould and\r\nrubbish was, which had so long concealed these ruins, I applied to Dr. H.\r\nJohnson, who had superintended the excavations; and he, with the greatest\r\nkindness, twice visited the place to examine it in reference to my\r\nquestions, and had many trenches dug in four fields which had hitherto\r\nbeen undisturbed.  The results of his observations are given in the\r\nfollowing Table.  He also sent me specimens of the mould, and answered,\r\nas far as he could, all my questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENTS BY DR.

Trench 14 inches deep, and                                     14\r\nthen came upon a building\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson distinguished as mould the earth which differed, more or less\r\nabruptly, in its dark colour and in its texture from the underlying sand\r\nor rubble.  In the specimens sent to me, the mould resembled that which\r\nlies immediately beneath the turf in old pasture-land, excepting that it\r\noften contained small stones, too large to have passed through the bodies\r\nof worms.  But the trenches above described were dug in fields, none of\r\nwhich were in pasture, and all had been long cultivated.  Bearing in mind\r\nthe remarks made in reference to Silchester on the effects of\r\nlong-continued culture, combined with the action of worms in bringing up\r\nthe finer particles to the surface, the mould, as so designated by Dr.\r\nJohnson, seems fairly well to deserve its name.  Its thickness, where\r\nthere was no causeway, floor or walls beneath, was greater than has been\r\nelsewhere observed, namely, in many places above 2 ft., and in one spot\r\nabove 3 ft.  The mould was thickest on and close to the nearly level\r\nsummit of the field called “Shop Leasows,” and in a small adjoining\r\nfield, which, as I believe, is of nearly the same height.  One side of\r\nthe former field slopes at an angle of rather above 2°, and I should have\r\nexpected that the mould, from being washed down during heavy rain, would\r\nhave been thicker in the lower than in the upper part; but this was not\r\nthe case in two out of the three trenches here dug.\r\n\r\nIn many places, where streets ran beneath the surface, or where old\r\nbuildings stood, the mould was only 8 inches in thickness; and Dr.\r\nJohnson was surprised that in ploughing the land, the ruins had never\r\nbeen struck by the plough as far as he had heard.  He thinks that when\r\nthe land was first cultivated the old walls were perhaps intentionally\r\npulled down, and that hollow places were filled up.  This may have been\r\nthe case; but if after the desertion of the city the land was left for\r\nmany centuries uncultivated, worms would have brought up enough fine\r\nearth to have covered the ruins completely; that is if they had subsided\r\nfrom having been undermined.  The foundations of some of the walls, for\r\ninstance those of the portion still standing about 20 feet above the\r\nground, and those of the marketplace, lie at the extraordinary depth of\r\n14 feet; but it is highly improbable that the foundations were generally\r\nso deep.  The mortar employed in the buildings must have been excellent,\r\nfor it is still in parts extremely hard.  Wherever walls of any height\r\nhave been exposed to view, they are, as Dr. Johnson believes, still\r\nperpendicular.  The walls with such deep foundations cannot have been\r\nundermined by worms, and therefore cannot have subsided, as appears to\r\nhave occurred at Abinger and Silchester.  Hence it is very difficult to\r\naccount for their being now completely covered with earth; but how much\r\nof this covering consists of vegetable mould and how much of rubble I do\r\nnot know.  The market-place, with the foundations at a depth of 14 feet,\r\nwas covered up, as Dr. Johnson believes, by between 6 and 24 inches of\r\nearth.  The tops of the broken-down walls of a caldarium or bath, 9 feet\r\nin depth, were likewise covered up with nearly 2 feet of earth.  The\r\nsummit of an arch, leading into an ash-pit 7 feet in depth, was covered\r\nup with not more than 8 inches of earth.  Whenever a building which has\r\nnot subsided is covered with earth, we must suppose, either that the\r\nupper layers of stone have been at some time carried away by man, or that\r\nearth has since been washed down during heavy rain, or blown down during\r\nstorms, from the adjoining land; and this would be especially apt to\r\noccur where the land has long been cultivated.  In the above cases the\r\nadjoining land is somewhat higher than the three specified sites, as far\r\nas I can judge by maps and from information given me by Dr. Johnson.  If;\r\nhowever, a great pile of broken stones, mortar, plaster, timber and ashes\r\nfell over the remains of any building, their disintegration in the course\r\nof time, and the sifting action of worms, would ultimately conceal the\r\nwhole beneath fine earth.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n_Conclusion_.—The cases given in this chapter show that worms have played\r\na considerable part in the burial and concealment of several Roman and\r\nother old buildings in England; but no doubt the washing down of soil\r\nfrom the neighbouring higher lands, and the deposition of dust, have\r\ntogether aided largely in the work of concealment.  Dust would be apt to\r\naccumulate wherever old broken-down walls projected a little above the\r\nthen existing surface and thus afforded some shelter.  The floors of the\r\nold rooms, halls and passages have generally sunk, partly from the\r\nsettling of the ground, but chiefly from having been undermined by worms;\r\nand the sinking has commonly been greater in the middle than near the\r\nwalls.  The walls themselves, whenever their foundations do not lie at a\r\ngreat depth, have been penetrated and undermined by worms, and have\r\nconsequently subsided.  The unequal subsidence thus caused, probably\r\nexplains the great cracks which may be seen in many ancient walls, as\r\nwell as their inclination from the perpendicular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nTHE ACTION OF WORMS IN THE DENUDATION OF THE LAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidence of the amount of denudation which the land has\r\nundergone—Sub-aerial denudation—The deposition of dust—Vegetable mould,\r\nits dark colour and fine texture largely due to the action of worms—The\r\ndisintegration of rocks by the humus-acids—Similar acids apparently\r\ngenerated within the bodies of worms—The action of these acids\r\nfacilitated by the continued movement of the particles of earth—A thick\r\nbed of mould checks the disintegration of the underlying soil and rocks.\r\nParticles of stone worn or triturated in the gizzards of worms—Swallowed\r\nstones serve as mill-stones—The levigated state of the castings—Fragments\r\nof brick in the castings over ancient buildings well rounded.  The\r\ntriturating power of worms not quite insignificant under a geological\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nNO one doubts that our world at one time consisted of crystalline rocks,\r\nand that it is to their disintegration through the action of air, water,\r\nchanges of temperature, rivers, waves of the sea, earthquakes and\r\nvolcanic outbursts, that we owe our sedimentary formations.  These after\r\nbeing consolidated and sometimes recrystallized, have often been again\r\ndisintegrated.  Denudation means the removal of such disintegrated matter\r\nto a lower level.  Of the many striking results due to the modern\r\nprogress of geology there are hardly any more striking than those which\r\nrelate to denudation.  It was long ago seen that there must have been an\r\nimmense amount of denudation; but until the successive formations were\r\ncarefully mapped and measured, no one fully realised how great was the\r\namount.  One of the first and most remarkable memoirs ever published on\r\nthis subject was that by Ramsay, {210} who in 1846 showed that in Wales\r\nfrom 9000 to 11,000 feet in thickness of solid rock had been stripped off\r\nlarge tracks of country.  Perhaps the plainest evidence of great\r\ndenudation is afforded by faults or cracks, which extend for many miles\r\nacross certain districts, with the strata on one side raised even ten\r\nthousand feet above the corresponding strata on the opposite side; and\r\nyet there is not a vestige of this gigantic displacement visible on the\r\nsurface of the land.  A huge pile of rock has been planed away on one\r\nside and not a remnant left.\r\n\r\nUntil the last twenty or thirty years, most geologists thought that the\r\nwaves of the sea were the chief agents in the work of denudation; but we\r\nmay now feel sure that air and rain, aided by streams and rivers, are\r\nmuch more powerful agents,—that is if we consider the whole area of the\r\nland.  The long lines of escarpment which stretch across several parts of\r\nEngland were formerly considered to be undoubtedly ancient coast-lines;\r\nbut we now know that they stand up above the general surface merely from\r\nresisting air, rain and frost better than the adjoining formations.  It\r\nhas rarely been the good fortune of a geologist to bring conviction to\r\nthe minds of his fellow-workers on a disputed point by a single memoir;\r\nbut Mr. Whitaker, of the Geological Survey of England, was so fortunate\r\nwhen, in 1867, he published his paper “On sub-aerial Denudation, and on\r\nCliffs and Escarpments of the Chalk.” {211}  Before this paper appeared,\r\nMr. A. Tylor had adduced important evidence on sub-aerial denudation, by\r\nshowing that the amount of matter brought down by rivers must infallibly\r\nlower the level of their drainage basins by many feet in no immense lapse\r\nof time.  This line of argument has since been followed up in the most\r\ninteresting manner by Archibald Geikie, Croll and others, in a series of\r\nvaluable memoirs. {212}  For the sake of those who have never attended to\r\nthis subject, a single instance may be here given, namely, that of the\r\nMississippi, which is chosen because the amount of sediment brought down\r\nby this great river has been investigated with especial care by order of\r\nthe United States Government.  The result is, as Mr. Croll shows, that\r\nthe mean level of its enormous area of drainage must be lowered 1/4566 of\r\na foot annually, or 1 foot in 4566 years.  Consequently, taking the best\r\nestimate of the mean height of the North American continent, viz. 748\r\nfeet, and looking to the future, the whole of the great Mississippi basin\r\nwill be washed away, and “brought down to the sea-level in less than\r\n4,500,000 years, if no elevation of the land takes place.”  Some rivers\r\ncarry down much more sediment relatively to their size, and some much\r\nless than the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nDisintegrated matter is carried away by the wind as well as by running\r\nwater.  During volcanic outbursts much rock is triturated and is thus\r\nwidely dispersed; and in all arid countries the wind plays an important\r\npart in the removal of such matter.  Wind-driven sand also wears down the\r\nhardest rocks.  I have shown {213} that during four months of the year a\r\nlarge quantity of dust is blown from the north-western shores of Africa,\r\nand falls on the Atlantic over a space of 1600 miles in latitude, and for\r\na distance of from 300 to 600 miles from the coast.  But dust has been\r\nseen to fall at a distance of 1030 miles from the shores of Africa.\r\nDuring a stay of three weeks at St. Jago in the Cape Verde Archipelago,\r\nthe atmosphere was almost always hazy, and extremely fine dust coming\r\nfrom Africa was continually falling.  In some of this dust which fell in\r\nthe open ocean at a distance of between 330 and 380 miles from the\r\nAfrican coast, there were many particles of stone, about 1/1000 of an\r\ninch square.  Nearer to the coast the water has been seen to be so much\r\ndiscoloured by the falling dust, that a sailing vessel left a track\r\nbehind her.  In countries, like the Cape Verde Archipelago, where it\r\nseldom rains and there are no frosts, the solid rock nevertheless\r\ndisintegrates; and in conformity with the views lately advanced by a\r\ndistinguished Belgian geologist, De Koninck, such disintegration may be\r\nattributed in chief part to the action of the carbonic and nitric acids,\r\ntogether with the nitrates and nitrites of ammonia, dissolved in the dew.\r\n\r\nIn all humid, even moderately humid, countries, worms aid in the work of\r\ndenudation in several ways.  The vegetable mould which covers, as with a\r\nmantle, the surface of the land, has all passed many times through their\r\nbodies.  Mould differs in appearance from the subsoil only in its dark\r\ncolour, and in the absence of fragments or particles of stone (when such\r\nare present in the subsoil), larger than those which can pass through the\r\nalimentary canal of a worm.  This sifting of the soil is aided, as has\r\nalready been remarked, by burrowing animals of many kinds, especially by\r\nants.  In countries where the summer is long and dry, the mould in\r\nprotected places must be largely increased by dust blown from other and\r\nmore exposed places.  For instance, the quantity of dust sometimes blown\r\nover the plains of La Plata, where there are no solid rocks, is so great,\r\nthat during the “gran seco,” 1827 to 1830, the appearance of the land,\r\nwhich is here unenclosed, was so completely changed that the inhabitants\r\ncould not recognise the limits of their own estates, and endless lawsuits\r\narose.  Immense quantities of dust are likewise blown about in Egypt and\r\nin the south of France.  In China, as Richthofen maintains, beds\r\nappearing like fine sediment, several hundred feet in thickness and\r\nextending over an enormous area, owe their origin to dust blown from the\r\nhigh lands of central Asia. {215}  In humid countries like Great Britain,\r\nas long as the land remains in its natural state clothed with vegetation,\r\nthe mould in any one place can hardly be much increased by dust; but in\r\nits present condition, the fields near high roads, where there is much\r\ntraffic, must receive a considerable amount of dust, and when fields are\r\nharrowed during dry and windy weather, clouds of dust may be seen to be\r\nblown away.  But in all these cases the surface-soil is merely\r\ntransported from one place to another.  The dust which falls so thickly\r\nwithin our houses consists largely of organic matter, and if spread over\r\nthe land would in time decay and disappear almost entirely.  It appears,\r\nhowever, from recent observations on the snow-fields of the Arctic\r\nregions, that some little meteoric dust of extra mundane origin is\r\ncontinually falling.\r\n\r\nThe dark colour of ordinary mould is obviously due to the presence of\r\ndecaying organic matter, which, however, is present in but small\r\nquantities.  The loss of weight which mould suffers when heated to\r\nredness seems to be in large part due to water in combination being\r\ndispelled.  In one sample of fertile mould the amount of organic matter\r\nwas ascertained to be only 1.76 per cent.; in some artificially prepared\r\nsoil it was as much as 5.5 per cent., and in the famous black soil of\r\nRussia from 5 to even 12 per cent. {217a}  In leaf-mould formed\r\nexclusively by the decay of leaves the amount is much greater, and in\r\npeat the carbon alone sometimes amounts to 64 per cent.; but with these\r\nlatter cases we are not here concerned.  The carbon in the soil tends\r\ngradually to oxidise and to disappear, except where water accumulates and\r\nthe climate is cool; {217b} so that in the oldest pasture-land there is\r\nno great excess of organic matter, notwithstanding the continued decay of\r\nthe roots and the underground stems of plants, and the occasional\r\naddition of manure.  The disappearance of the organic matter from mould\r\nis probably much aided by its being brought again and again to the\r\nsurface in the castings of worms.\r\n\r\nWorms, on the other hand, add largely to the organic matter in the soil\r\nby the astonishing number of half-decayed leaves which they draw into\r\ntheir burrows to a depth of 2 or 3 inches.  They do this chiefly for\r\nobtaining food, but partly for closing the mouths of their burrows and\r\nfor lining the upper part.  The leaves which they consume are moistened,\r\ntorn into small shreds, partially digested, and intimately commingled\r\nwith earth; and it is this process which gives to vegetable mould its\r\nuniform dark tint.  It is known that various kinds of acids are generated\r\nby the decay of vegetable matter; and from the contents of the intestines\r\nof worms and from their castings being acid, it seems probable that the\r\nprocess of digestion induces an analogous chemical change in the\r\nswallowed, triturated, and half-decayed leaves.  The large quantity of\r\ncarbonate of lime secreted by the calciferous glands apparently serves to\r\nneutralise the acids thus generated; for the digestive fluid of worms\r\nwill not act unless it be alkaline.  As the contents of the upper part of\r\ntheir intestines are acid, the acidity can hardly be due to the presence\r\nof uric acid.  We may therefore conclude that the acids in the alimentary\r\ncanal of worms are formed during the digestive process; and that probably\r\nthey are nearly of the same nature as those in ordinary mould or humus.\r\nThe latter are well known to have the power of de-oxidising or dissolving\r\nper-oxide of iron, as may be seen wherever peat overlies red sand, or\r\nwhere a rotten root penetrates such sand.  Now I kept some worms in a pot\r\nfilled with very fine reddish sand, consisting of minute particles of\r\nsilex coated with the red oxide of iron; and the burrows, which the worms\r\nmade through this sand, were lined or coated in the usual manner with\r\ntheir castings, formed of the sand mingled with their intestinal\r\nsecretions and the refuse of the digested leaves; and this sand had\r\nalmost wholly lost its red colour.  When small portions of it were placed\r\nunder the microscope, most of the grains were seen to be transparent and\r\ncolourless, owing to the dissolution of the oxide; whilst almost all the\r\ngrains taken from other parts of the pot were coated with the oxide.\r\nAcetic acid produced hardly any effect on his sand; and even\r\nhydrochloric, nitric and sulphuric acids, diluted as in the\r\nPharmacopoeia, produced less effect than did the acids in the intestines\r\nof the worms.\r\n\r\nMr. A. A. Julien has lately collected all the extant information about\r\nthe acids generated in humus, which, according to some chemists, amount\r\nto more than a dozen different kinds.  These acids, as well as their acid\r\nsalts (i.e., in combination with potash, soda, and ammonia), act\r\nenergetically on carbonate of lime and on the oxides of iron.  It is also\r\nknown that some of these acids, which were called long ago by Thénard\r\nazohumic, are enabled to dissolve colloid silica in proportion to the\r\nnitrogen which they contain. {220}  In the formation of these latter\r\nacids worms probably afford some aid, for Dr. H. Johnson informs me that\r\nby Nessler’s test he found 0.018 per cent. of ammonia in their castings.\r\n\r\nIt may be here added that I have recently been informed by Dr. Gilbert\r\n“that several square yards on his lawn were swept clean, and after two or\r\nthree weeks all the worm-castings on the space were collected and dried.\r\nThese were found to contain 0.35 of nitrogen.  This is from two to three\r\ntimes as much as we find in our ordinary arable surface-soil; more than\r\nin our ordinary pasture surface-soil; but less than in rich\r\nkitchen-garden mould.  Supposing a quantity of castings equal to 10 tons\r\nin the dry state were annually deposited on an acre, this would represent\r\na manuring of 78 lbs. of nitrogen per acre per annum; and this is very\r\nmuch more than the amount of nitrogen in the annual yield of hay per\r\nacre, if raised without any nitrogenous manure.  Obviously, so far as the\r\nnitrogen in the castings is derived from surface-growth or from\r\nsurface-soil, it is not a gain to the latter; but so far as it is derived\r\nfrom below, it is a gain.”\r\n\r\nThe several humus-acids, which appear, as we have just seen, to be\r\ngenerated within the bodies of worms during the digestive process, and\r\ntheir acid salts, play a highly important part, according to the recent\r\nobservations of Mr. Julien, in the disintegration of various kinds of\r\nrocks.  It has long been known that the carbonic acid, and no doubt\r\nnitric and nitrous acids, which are present in rain-water, act in like\r\nmanner.  There is, also, a great excess of carbonic acid in all soils,\r\nespecially in rich soils, and this is dissolved by the water in the\r\nground.  The living roots of plants, moreover, as Sachs and others have\r\nshown, quickly corrode and leave their impressions on polished slabs of\r\nmarble, dolomite and phosphate of lime.  They will attack even basalt and\r\nsandstone. {222}  But we are not here concerned with agencies which are\r\nwholly independent of the action of worms.\r\n\r\nThe combination of any acid with a base is much facilitated by agitation,\r\nas fresh surfaces are thus continually brought into contact.  This will\r\nbe thoroughly effected with the particles of stone and earth in the\r\nintestines of worms, during the digestive process; and it should be\r\nremembered that the entire mass of the mould over every field, passes, in\r\nthe course of a few years, through their alimentary canals.  Moreover as\r\nthe old burrows slowly collapse, and as fresh castings are continually\r\nbrought to the surface, the whole superficial layer of mould slowly\r\nrevolves or circulates; and the friction of the particles one with\r\nanother will rub off the finest films of disintegrated matter as soon as\r\nthey are formed.  Through these several means, minute fragments of rocks\r\nof many kinds and mere particles in the soil will be continually exposed\r\nto chemical decomposition; and thus the amount of soil will tend to\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nAs worms line their burrows with their castings, and as the burrows\r\npenetrate to a depth of 5 or 6, or even more feet, some small amount of\r\nthe humus-acids will be carried far down, and will there act on the\r\nunderlying rocks and fragments of rock.  Thus the thickness of the soil,\r\nif none be removed from the surface, will steadily though slowly tend to\r\nincrease; but the accumulation will after a time delay the disintegration\r\nof the underlying rocks and of the more deeply seated particles.  For the\r\nhumus-acids which are generated chiefly in the upper layer of vegetable\r\nmould, are extremely unstable compounds, and are liable to decomposition\r\nbefore they reach any considerable depth. {223}  A thick bed of overlying\r\nsoil will also check the downward extension of great fluctuations of\r\ntemperature, and in cold countries will check the powerful action of\r\nfrost.  The free access of air will likewise be excluded.  From these\r\nseveral causes disintegration would be almost arrested, if the overlying\r\nmould were to increase much in thickness, owing to none or little being\r\nremoved from the surface. {224a}  In my own immediate neighbourhood we\r\nhave a curious proof how effectually a few feet of clay checks some\r\nchange which goes on in flints, lying freely exposed; for the large ones\r\nwhich have lain for some time on the surface of ploughed fields cannot be\r\nused for building; they will not cleave properly, and are said by the\r\nworkmen to be rotten. {224b}  It is therefore necessary to obtain flints\r\nfor building purposes from the bed of red clay overlying the chalk (the\r\nresidue of its dissolution by rain-water) or from the chalk itself.\r\n\r\nNot only do worms aid directly in the chemical disintegration of rocks,\r\nbut there is good reason to believe that they likewise act in a direct\r\nand mechanical manner on the smaller particles.  All the species which\r\nswallow earth are furnished with gizzards; and these are lined with so\r\nthick a chitinous membrane, that Perrier speaks of it, {225a} as “une\r\nvéritable armature.”  The gizzard is surrounded by powerful transverse\r\nmuscles, which, according to Claparède, are about ten times as thick as\r\nthe longitudinal ones; and Perrier saw them contracting energetically.\r\nWorms belonging to one genus, Digaster, have two distinct but quite\r\nsimilar gizzards; and in another genus, Moniligaster, the second gizzard\r\nconsists of four pouches, one succeeding the other, so that it may almost\r\nbe said to have five gizzards. {225b}  In the same manner as gallinaceous\r\nand struthious birds swallow stones to aid in the trituration of their\r\nfood, so it appears to be with terricolous worms.  The gizzards of\r\nthirty-eight of our common worms were opened, and in twenty-five of them\r\nsmall stones or grains of sand, sometimes together with the hard\r\ncalcareous concretions formed within the anterior calciferous glands,\r\nwere found, and in two others concretions alone.  In the gizzards of the\r\nremaining worms there were no stones; but some of these were not real\r\nexceptions, as the gizzards were opened late in the autumn, when the\r\nworms had ceased to feed and their gizzards were quite empty. {226}\r\n\r\nWhen worms make their burrows through earth abounding with little stones,\r\nno doubt many will be unavoidably swallowed; but it must not be supposed\r\nthat this fact accounts for the frequency with which stones and sand are\r\nfound in their gizzards.  For beads of glass and fragments of brick and\r\nof hard tiles were scattered over the surface of the earth, in pots in\r\nwhich worms were kept and had already made their burrows; and very many\r\nof these beads and fragments were picked up and swallowed by the worms,\r\nfor they were found in their castings, intestines, and gizzards.  They\r\neven swallowed the coarse red dust, formed by the pounding of the tiles.\r\nNor can it be supposed that they mistook the beads and fragments for\r\nfood; for we have seen that their taste is delicate enough to distinguish\r\nbetween different kinds of leaves.  It is therefore manifest that they\r\nswallow hard objects, such as bits of stone, beads of glass and angular\r\nfragments of bricks or tiles for some special purpose; and it can hardly\r\nbe doubted that this is to aid their gizzards in crushing and grinding\r\nthe earth, which they so largely consume.  That such hard objects are not\r\nnecessary for crushing leaves, may be inferred from the fact that certain\r\nspecies, which live in mud or water and feed on dead or living vegetable\r\nmatter, but which do not swallow earth, are not provided with gizzards,\r\n{227} and therefore cannot have the power of utilising stones.\r\n\r\nDuring the grinding process, the particles of earth must be rubbed\r\nagainst one another, and between the stones and the tough lining membrane\r\nof the gizzard.  The softer particles will thus suffer some attrition,\r\nand will perhaps even be crushed.  This conclusion is supported by the\r\nappearance of freshly ejected castings, for these often reminded me of\r\nthe appearance of paint which has just been ground by a workman between\r\ntwo flat stones.  Morren remarks that the intestinal canal is “impleta\r\ntenuissimâ terrâ, veluti in pulverem redactâ.” {228a}  Perrier also\r\nspeaks of “l’état de pâte excessivement fine à laquelle est réduite la\r\nterre qu’ils rejettent,” &c. {228b}\r\n\r\nAs the amount of trituration which the particles of earth undergo in the\r\ngizzards of worms possesses some interest (as we shall hereafter see), I\r\nendeavoured to obtain evidence on this head by carefully examining many\r\nof the fragments which had passed through their alimentary canals.  With\r\nworms living in a state of nature, it is of course impossible to know how\r\nmuch the fragments may have been worn before they were swallowed.  It is,\r\nhowever, clear that worms do not habitually select already rounded\r\nparticles, for sharply angular bits of flint and of other hard rocks were\r\noften found in their gizzards or intestines.  On three occasions sharp\r\nspines from the stems of rose-bushes were thus found.  Worms kept in\r\nconfinement repeatedly swallowed angular fragments of hard tile, coal,\r\ncinders, and even the sharpest fragments of glass.  Gallinaceous and\r\nstruthious birds retain the same stones in their gizzards for a long\r\ntime, which thus become well rounded; but this does not appear to be the\r\ncase with worms, judging from the large number of the fragments of tiles,\r\nglass beads, stones, &c., commonly found in their castings and\r\nintestines.  So that unless the same fragments were to pass repeatedly\r\nthrough their gizzards, visible signs of attrition in the fragments could\r\nhardly be expected, except perhaps in the case of very soft stones.\r\n\r\nI will now give such evidence of attrition as I have been able to\r\ncollect.  In the gizzards of some worms dug out of a thin bed of mould\r\nover the chalk, there were many well-rounded small fragments of chalk,\r\nand two fragments of the shells of a land-mollusc (as ascertained by\r\ntheir microscopical structure), which latter were not only rounded but\r\nsomewhat polished.  The calcareous concretions formed in the calciferous\r\nglands, which are often found in their gizzards, intestines, and\r\noccasionally in their castings, when of large size, sometimes appeared to\r\nhave been rounded; but with all calcareous bodies the rounded appearance\r\nmay be partly or wholly due to their corrosion by carbonic acid and the\r\nhumus-acids.  In the gizzards of several worms collected in my kitchen\r\ngarden near a hothouse, eight little fragments of cinders were found, and\r\nof these, six appeared more or less rounded, as were two bits of brick;\r\nbut some other bits were not at all rounded.  A farm-road near Abinger\r\nHall had been covered seven years before with brick-rubbish to the depth\r\nof about 6 inches; turf had grown over this rubbish on both sides of the\r\nroad for a width of 18 inches, and on this turf there were innumerable\r\ncastings.  Some of them were coloured of a uniform red owing to the\r\npresence of much brick-dust, and they contained many particles of brick\r\nand of hard mortar from 1 to 3 mm. in diameter, most of which were\r\nplainly rounded; but all these particles may have been rounded before\r\nthey were protected by the turf and were swallowed, like those on the\r\nbare parts of the road which were much worn.  A hole in a pasture-field\r\nhad been filled up with brick-rubbish at the same time, viz., seven years\r\nago, and was now covered with turf; and here the castings contained very\r\nmany particles of brick, all more or less rounded; and this\r\nbrick-rubbish, after being shot into the hole, could not have undergone\r\nany attrition.  Again, old bricks very little broken, together with\r\nfragments of mortar, were laid down to form walks, and were then covered\r\nwith from 4 to 6 inches of gravel; six little fragments of brick were\r\nextracted from castings collected on these walks, three of which were\r\nplainly worn.  There were also very many particles of hard mortar, about\r\nhalf of which were well rounded; and it is not credible that these could\r\nhave suffered so much corrosion from the action of carbonic acid in the\r\ncourse of only seven years.\r\n\r\nMuch better evidence of the attrition of hard objects in the gizzards of\r\nworms, is afforded by the state of the small fragments of tiles or\r\nbricks, and of concrete in the castings thrown up where ancient buildings\r\nonce stood.  As all the mould covering a field passes every few years\r\nthrough the bodies of worms, the same small fragments will probably be\r\nswallowed and brought to the surface many times in the course of\r\ncenturies.  It should be premised that in the several following cases,\r\nthe finer matter was first washed away from the castings, and then _all_\r\nthe particles of bricks, tiles and concrete were collected without any\r\nselection, and were afterwards examined.  Now in the castings ejected\r\nbetween the tesseræ on one of the buried floors of the Roman villa at\r\nAbinger, there were many particles (from ½ to 2 mm. in diameter) of tiles\r\nand concrete, which it was impossible to look at with the naked eye or\r\nthrough a strong lens, and doubt for a moment that they had almost all\r\nundergone much attrition.  I speak thus after having examined small\r\nwater-worn pebbles, formed from Roman bricks, which M. Henri de Saussure\r\nhad the kindness to send me, and which he had extracted from sand and\r\ngravel beds, deposited on the shores of the Lake of Geneva, at a former\r\nperiod when the water stood at about two metres above its present level.\r\nThe smallest of these water-worn pebbles of brick from Geneva resembled\r\nclosely many of those extracted from the gizzards of worms, but the\r\nlarger ones were somewhat smoother.\r\n\r\nFour castings found on the recently uncovered, tesselated floor of the\r\ngreat room in the Roman villa at Brading, contained many particles of\r\ntile or brick, of mortar, and of hard white cement; and the majority of\r\nthese appeared plainly worn.  The particles of mortar, however, seemed to\r\nhave suffered more corrosion than attrition, for grains of silex often\r\nprojected from their surfaces.  Castings from within the nave of Beaulieu\r\nAbbey, which was destroyed by Henry VIII., were collected from a level\r\nexpanse of turf, overlying the buried tesselated pavement, through which\r\nworm-burrows passed; and these castings contained innumerable particles\r\nof tiles and bricks, of concrete and cement, the majority of which had\r\nmanifestly undergone some or much attrition.  There were also many minute\r\nflakes of a micaceous slate, the points of which were rounded.  If the\r\nabove supposition, that in all these cases the same minute fragments have\r\npassed several times through the gizzards of worms, be rejected,\r\nnotwithstanding its inherent probability, we must then assume that in all\r\nthe above cases the many rounded fragments found in the castings had all\r\naccidentally undergone much attrition before they were swallowed; and\r\nthis is highly improbable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it must be stated that fragments of ornamental tiles,\r\nsomewhat harder than common tiles or bricks, which had been swallowed\r\nonly once by worms kept in confinement, were with the doubtful exception\r\nof one or two of the smallest grains, not at all rounded.  Nevertheless\r\nsome of them appeared a little worn, though not rounded.  Notwithstanding\r\nthese cases, if we consider the evidence above given, there can be little\r\ndoubt that the fragments, which serve as millstones in the gizzards of\r\nworms, suffer, when of a not very hard texture, some amount of attrition;\r\nand that the smaller particles in the earth, which is habitually\r\nswallowed in such astonishingly large quantities by worms, are ground\r\ntogether and are thus levigated.  If this be the case, the “terra\r\ntenuissima,”—the “pâte excessivement fine,”—of which the castings largely\r\nconsist, is in part due to the mechanical action of the gizzard; {234}\r\nand this fine matter, as we shall see in the next chapter, is that which\r\nis chiefly washed away from the innumerable castings on every field\r\nduring each heavy shower of rain.  If the softer stones yield at all, the\r\nharder ones will suffer some slight amount of wear and tear.\r\n\r\nThe trituration of small particles of stone in the gizzards of worms is\r\nof more importance under a geological point of view than may at first\r\nappear to be the case; for Mr. Sorby has clearly shown that the ordinary\r\nmeans of disintegration, namely, running water and the waves of the sea,\r\nact with less and less power on fragments of rock the smaller they are.\r\n“Hence,” as he remarks, “even making no allowance for the extra buoying\r\nup of very minute particles by a current of water, depending on surface\r\ncohesion, the effects of wearing on the form of the grains must vary\r\ndirectly as their diameter or thereabouts.  If so, a grain of 1/10 an\r\ninch in diameter would be worn ten times as much as one of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and at least a hundred times as much as one of 1/100 an inch in\r\ndiameter.  Perhaps, then, we may conclude that a grain 1/10 of an inch in\r\ndiameter would be worn as much or more in drifting a mile as a grain\r\n1/1000 of an inch in being drifted 100 miles.  On the same principle a\r\npebble one inch in diameter would be worn relatively more by being\r\ndrifted only a few hundred yards.” {236}  Nor should we forget, in\r\nconsidering the power which worms exert in triturating particles of rock,\r\nthat there is good evidence that on each acre of land, which is\r\nsufficiently damp and not too sandy, gravelly or rocky for worms to\r\ninhabit, a weight of more than ten tons of earth annually passes through\r\ntheir bodies and is brought to the surface.  The result for a country of\r\nthe size of Great Britain, within a period not very long in a geological\r\nsense, such as a million years, cannot be insignificant; for the ten tons\r\nof earth has to be multiplied first by the above number of years, and\r\nthen by the number of acres fully stocked with worms; and in England,\r\ntogether with Scotland, the land which is cultivated and is well fitted\r\nfor these animals, has been estimated at above 32 million acres.  The\r\nproduct is 320 million million tons of earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTHE DENUDATION OF THE LAND—_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDenudation aided by recently ejected castings flowing down inclined\r\ngrass-covered surfaces—The amount of earth which annually flows\r\ndownwards—The effect of tropical rain on worm castings—The finest\r\nparticles of earth washed completely away from castings—The\r\ndisintegration of dried castings into pellets, and their rolling down\r\ninclined surfaces—The formation of little ledges on hill-sides, in part\r\ndue to the accumulation of disintegrated castings—Castings blown to\r\nleeward over level land—An attempt to estimate the amount thus blown—The\r\ndegradation of ancient encampments and tumuli—The preservation of the\r\ncrowns and furrows on land anciently ploughed—The formation and amount of\r\nmould over the Chalk formation.\r\n\r\nWE are now prepared to consider the more direct part which worms take in\r\nthe denudation of the land.  When reflecting on sub-aerial denudation, it\r\nformerly appeared to me, as it has to others, that a nearly level or very\r\ngently inclined surface, covered with turf, could suffer no loss during\r\neven a long lapse of time.  It may, however, be urged that at long\r\nintervals, debacles of rain or water-spouts would remove all the mould\r\nfrom a very gentle slope; but when examining the steep, turf-covered\r\nslopes in Glen Roy, I was struck with the fact how rarely any such event\r\ncould have happened since the Glacial period, as was plain from the\r\nwell-preserved state of the three successive “roads” or lake-margins.\r\nBut the difficulty in believing that earth in any appreciable quantity\r\ncan be removed from a gently inclined surface, covered with vegetation\r\nand matted with roots, is removed through the agency of worms.  For the\r\nmany castings which are thrown up during rain, and those thrown up some\r\nlittle time before heavy rain, flow for a short distance down an inclined\r\nsurface.  Moreover much of the finest levigated earth is washed\r\ncompletely away from the castings.  During dry weather castings often\r\ndisintegrate into small rounded pellets, and these from their weight\r\noften roll down any slope.  This is more especially apt to occur when\r\nthey are started by the wind, and probably when started by the touch of\r\nan animal, however small.  We shall also see that a strong wind blows all\r\nthe castings, even on a level field, to leeward, whilst they are soft;\r\nand in like manner the pellets when they are dry.  If the wind blows in\r\nnearly the direction of an inclined surface, the flowing down of the\r\ncastings is much aided.\r\n\r\nThe observations on which these several statements are founded must now\r\nbe given in some detail.  Castings when first ejected are viscid and\r\nsoft; during rain, at which time worms apparently prefer to eject them,\r\nthey are still softer; so that I have sometimes thought that worms must\r\nswallow much water at such times.  However this may be, rain, even when\r\nnot very heavy, if long continued, renders recently-ejected castings\r\nsemi-fluid; and on level ground they then spread out into thin, circular,\r\nflat discs, exactly as would so much honey or very soft mortar, with all\r\ntraces of their vermiform structure lost.  This latter fact was sometimes\r\nmade evident, when a worm had subsequently bored through a flat circular\r\ndisc of this kind, and heaped up a fresh vermiform mass in the centre.\r\nThese flat subsided discs have been repeatedly seen by me after heavy\r\nrain, in many places on land of all kinds.\r\n\r\n_On the flowing of wet castings_, _and the rolling of dry disintegrated\r\ncastings down inclined surfaces_.—When castings are ejected on an\r\ninclined surface during or shortly before heavy rain, they cannot fail to\r\nflow a little down the slope.  Thus, on some steep slopes in Knole Park,\r\nwhich were covered with coarse grass and had apparently existed in this\r\nstate from time immemorial, I found (Oct. 22, 1872) after several wet\r\ndays that almost all the many castings were considerably elongated in the\r\nline of the slope; and that they now consisted of smooth, only slightly\r\nconical masses.  Whenever the mouths of the burrows could be found from\r\nwhich the earth had been ejected, there was more earth below than above\r\nthem.  After some heavy storms of rain (Jan. 25, 1872) two rather steeply\r\ninclined fields near Down, which had formerly been ploughed and were now\r\nrather sparsely clothed with poor grass, were visited, and many castings\r\nextended down the slopes for a length of 5 inches, which was twice or\r\nthrice the usual diameter of the castings thrown up on the level parts of\r\nthese same fields.  On some fine grassy slopes in Holwood Park, inclined\r\nat angles between 8° and 11° 30′ with the horizon, where the surface\r\napparently had never been disturbed by the hand of man, castings abounded\r\nin extraordinary numbers: and a space 16 inches in length transversely to\r\nthe slope and 6 inches in the line of the slope, was completely coated,\r\nbetween the blades of grass, with a uniform sheet of confluent and\r\nsubsided castings.  Here also in many places the castings had flowed down\r\nthe slope, and now formed smooth narrow patches of earth, 6, 7, and 7½\r\ninches in length.  Some of these consisted of two castings, one above the\r\nother, which had become so completely confluent that they could hardly be\r\ndistinguished.  On my lawn, clothed with very fine grass, most of the\r\ncastings are black, but some are yellowish from earth having been brought\r\nup from a greater depth than usual, and the flowing-down of these yellow\r\ncastings after heavy rain, could be clearly seen where the slope was 5°;\r\nand where it was less than 1° some evidence of their flowing down could\r\nstill be detected.  On another occasion, after rain which was never\r\nheavy, but which lasted for 18 hours, all the castings on this same\r\ngently inclined lawn had lost their vermiform structure; and they had\r\nflowed, so that fully two-thirds of the ejected earth lay below the\r\nmouths of the burrows.\r\n\r\nThese observations led me to make others with more care. Eight castings\r\nwere found on my lawn, where the grass-blades are fine and close\r\ntogether, and three others on a field with coarse grass. The\r\ninclination of the surface at the eleven places where these castings\r\nwere collected varied between 4° 30′ and 17° 30′; the mean of the\r\neleven inclinations being 9° 26′. The length of the castings in the\r\ndirection of the slope was first measured with as much accuracy as\r\ntheir irregularities would permit. It was found possible to make these\r\nmeasurements within about ⅛ of an inch, but one of the castings was too\r\nirregular to admit of measurement. The average length in the direction\r\nof the slope of the remaining ten castings was 2.03 inches. The\r\ncastings were then divided with a knife into two parts along a\r\nhorizontal line passing through the mouth of the burrow, which was\r\ndiscovered by slicing off the turf; and all the ejected earth was\r\nseparately collected, namely, the part above the hole and the part\r\nbelow. Afterwards these two parts were weighed. In every case there was\r\nmuch more earth below than above; the mean weight of that above being\r\n103 grains, and of that below 205 grains; so that the latter was very\r\nnearly double the former. As on level ground castings are commonly\r\nthrown up almost equally round the mouths of the burrows, this\r\ndifference in weight indicates the amount of ejected earth which had\r\nflowed down the slope. But very many more observations would be\r\nrequisite to arrive at any general result; for the nature of the\r\nvegetation and other accidental circumstances, such as the heaviness of\r\nthe rain, the direction and force of the wind, &c., appear to be more\r\nimportant in determining the quantity of the earth which flows down a\r\nslope than its angle. Thus with four castings on my lawn (included in\r\nthe above eleven) where the mean slope was 7° 19′, the difference in\r\nthe amount of earth above and below the burrows was greater than with\r\nthree other castings on the same lawn where the mean slope was 12° 5′.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, take the above eleven cases, which are accurate as far\r\nas they go, and calculate the weight of the ejected earth which annually\r\nflows down a slope having a mean inclination of 9° 26′.  This was done by\r\nmy son George.  It has been shown that almost exactly two-thirds of the\r\nejected earth is found below the mouth of the burrow and one-third above\r\nit.  Now if the two-thirds which is below the hole be divided into two\r\nequal parts, the upper half of this two-thirds exactly counterbalances\r\nthe one-third which is above the hole, so that as far as regards the\r\none-third above and the upper half of the two-thirds below, there is no\r\nflow of earth down the hill-side.  The earth constituting the lower half\r\nof the two-thirds is, however, displaced through distances which are\r\ndifferent for every part of it, but which may be represented by the\r\ndistance between the middle point of the lower half of the two-thirds and\r\nthe hole.  So that the average distance of displacement is a half of the\r\nwhole length of the worm-casting.  Now the average length of ten out of\r\nthe above eleven castings was 2.03 inches, and half of this we may take\r\nas being 1 inch.  It may therefore be concluded that one-third of the\r\nwhole earth brought to the surface was in these cases carried down the\r\nslope through 1 inch. {244}\r\n\r\nIt was shown in the third chapter that on Leith Hill Common, dry earth\r\nweighing at least 7.453 lbs. was brought up by worms to the surface on a\r\nsquare yard in the course of a year.  If a square yard be drawn on a\r\nhillside with two of its sides horizontal, then it is clear that only\r\n1/36 part of the earth brought up on that square yard would be near\r\nenough to its lower side to cross it, supposing the displacement of the\r\nearth to be through one inch.  But it appears that only ⅓ of the earth\r\nbrought up can be considered to flow downwards; hence ⅓ of 1/36 or 1/108\r\nof 7.453 lbs. will cross the lower side of our square yard in a year.\r\nNow 1/108 of 7.453 lbs. is 1.1 oz.  Therefore 1.1 oz. of dry earth will\r\nannually cross each linear yard running horizontally along a slope having\r\nthe above inclination; or very nearly 7 lbs. will annually cross a\r\nhorizontal line, 100 yards in length, on a hill-side having this\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\nA more accurate, though still very rough, calculation can be made of the\r\nbulk of earth, which in its natural damp state annually flows down the\r\nsame slope over a yard-line drawn horizontally across it.  From the\r\nseveral cases given in the third chapter, it is known that the castings\r\nannually brought to the surface on a square yard, if uniformly spread out\r\nwould form a layer 0.2 of an inch in thickness: it therefore follows by a\r\ncalculation similar to the one already given, that ⅓ of 0.2 × 36, or 2.4\r\ncubic inches of damp earth will annually cross a horizontal line one yard\r\nin length on a hillside with the above inclination.  This bulk of damp\r\ncastings was found to weigh 1.85 oz.  Therefore 11.56 lbs. of damp earth,\r\ninstead of 7 lbs. of dry earth as by the former calculation, would\r\nannually cross a line 100 yards in length on our inclined surface.\r\n\r\nIn these calculations it has been assumed that the castings flow a short\r\ndistance downwards during the whole year, but this occurs only with those\r\nejected during or shortly before rain; so that the above results are thus\r\nfar exaggerated.  On the other hand, during rain much of the finest earth\r\nis washed to a considerable distance from the castings, even where the\r\nslope is an extremely gentle one, and is thus wholly lost as far as the\r\nabove calculations are concerned.  Castings ejected during dry weather\r\nand which have set hard, lose in the same manner a considerable quantity\r\nof fine earth.  Dried castings, moreover, are apt to disintegrate into\r\nlittle pellets, which often roll or are blown down any inclined surface.\r\nTherefore the above result, namely, that 24 cubic inches of earth\r\n(weighing 1.85 oz. whilst damp) annually crosses a yard-line of the\r\nspecified kind, is probably not much if at all exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThis amount is small; but we should bear in mind how many branching\r\nvalleys intersect most countries, the whole length of which must be very\r\ngreat; and that earth is steadily travelling down both turf-covered sides\r\nof each valley.  For every 100 yards in length in a valley with sides\r\nsloping as in the foregoing cases, 480 cubic inches of damp earth,\r\nweighing above 23 pounds, will annually reach the bottom.  Here a thick\r\nbed of alluvium will accumulate, ready to be washed away in the course of\r\ncenturies, as the stream in the middle meanders from side to side.\r\n\r\nIf it could be shown that worms generally excavate their burrows at right\r\nangles to an inclined surface, and this would be their shortest course\r\nfor bringing up earth from beneath, then as the old burrows collapsed\r\nfrom the weight of the superincumbent soil, the collapsing would\r\ninevitably cause the whole bed of vegetable mould to sink or slide slowly\r\ndown the inclined surface.  But to ascertain the direction of many\r\nburrows was found too difficult and troublesome.  A straight piece of\r\nwire was, however, pushed into twenty-five burrows on several sloping\r\nfields, and in eight cases the burrows were nearly at right angles to the\r\nslope; whilst in the remaining cases they were indifferently directed at\r\nvarious angles, either upwards or downwards with respect to the slope.\r\n\r\nIn countries where the rain is very heavy, as in the tropics, the\r\ncastings appear, as might have been expected, to be washed down in a\r\ngreater degree than in England.  Mr. Scott informs me that near Calcutta\r\nthe tall columnar castings (previously described), the diameter of which\r\nis usually between 1 and 1½ inch, subside on a level surface, after heavy\r\nrain, into almost circular, thin, flat discs, between 3 and 4 and\r\nsometimes 5 inches in diameter.  Three fresh castings, which had been\r\nejected in the Botanic Gardens “on a slightly inclined, grass-covered,\r\nartificial bank of loamy clay,” were carefully measured, and had a mean\r\nheight of 2.17, and a mean diameter of 1.43 inches; these after heavy\r\nrain, formed elongated patches of earth, with a mean length in the\r\ndirection of the slope of 5.83 inches.  As the earth had spread very\r\nlittle up the slope, a large part, judging from the original diameter of\r\nthese castings, must have flowed bodily downwards about 4 inches.\r\nMoreover some of the finest earth of which they were composed must have\r\nbeen washed completely away to a still greater distance.  In drier sites\r\nnear Calcutta, a species of worm ejects its castings, not in vermiform\r\nmasses, but in little pellets of varying sizes: these are very numerous\r\nin some places, and Mr. Scott says that they “are washed away by every\r\nshower.”\r\n\r\nI was led to believe that a considerable quantity of fine earth is washed\r\nquite away from castings during rain, from the surfaces of old ones being\r\noften studded with coarse particles.  Accordingly a little fine\r\nprecipitated chalk, moistened with saliva or gum-water, so as to be\r\nslightly viscid and of the same consistence as a fresh casting, was\r\nplaced on the summits of several castings and gently mixed with them.\r\nThese castings were then watered through a very fine rose, the drops from\r\nwhich were closer together than those of rain, but not nearly so large as\r\nthose in a thunderstorm; nor did they strike the ground with nearly so\r\nmuch force as drops during heavy rain.  A casting thus treated subsided\r\nwith surprising slowness, owing as I suppose to its viscidity.  It did\r\nnot flow bodily down the grass-covered surface of the lawn, which was\r\nhere inclined at an angle of 16° 20′; nevertheless many particles of the\r\nchalk were found three inches below the casting.  The experiment was\r\nrepeated on three other castings on different parts of the lawn, which\r\nsloped at 2° 30′, 3° and 6°; and particles of chalk could be seen between\r\n4 and 5 inches below the casting; and after the surface had become dry,\r\nparticles were found in two cases at a distance of 5 and 6 inches.\r\nSeveral other castings with precipitated chalk placed on their summits\r\nwere left to the natural action of the rain.  In one case, after rain\r\nwhich was not heavy, the casting was longitudinally streaked with white.\r\nIn two other cases the surface of the ground was rendered somewhat white\r\nfor a distance of one inch from the casting; and some soil collected at a\r\ndistance of 2½ inches, where the slope was 7°, effervesced slightly when\r\nplaced in acid.  After one or two weeks, the chalk was wholly or almost\r\nwholly washed away from all the castings on which it had been placed, and\r\nthese had recovered their natural colour.\r\n\r\nIt may be here remarked that after very heavy rain shallow pools may be\r\nseen on level or nearly level fields, where the soil is not very porous,\r\nand the water in them is often slightly muddy; when such little pools\r\nhave dried, the leaves and blades of grass at their bottoms are generally\r\ncoated with a thin layer of mud.  This mud I believe is derived in large\r\npart from recently ejected castings.\r\n\r\nDr. King informs me that the majority of the before described gigantic\r\ncastings, which he found on a fully exposed, bare, gravelly knoll on the\r\nNilgiri Mountains in India, had been more or less weathered by the\r\nprevious north-east monsoon; and most of them presented a subsided\r\nappearance.  The worms here eject their castings only during the rainy\r\nseason; and at the time of Dr. King’s visit no rain had fallen for 110\r\ndays.  He carefully examined the ground between the place where these\r\nhuge castings lay, and a little watercourse at the base of the knoll, and\r\nnowhere was there any accumulation of fine earth, such as would\r\nnecessarily have been left by the disintegration of the castings if they\r\nhad not been wholly removed.  He therefore has no hesitation in asserting\r\nthat the whole of these huge castings are annually washed during the two\r\nmonsoons (when about 100 inches of rain fall) into the little\r\nwater-course, and thence into the plains lying below at a depth of 3000\r\nor 4000 feet.\r\n\r\nCastings ejected before or during dry weather become hard, sometimes\r\nsurprisingly hard, from the particles of earth having been cemented\r\ntogether by the intestinal secretions.  Frost seems to be less effective\r\nin their disintegration than might have been expected.  Nevertheless they\r\nreadily disintegrate into small pellets, after being alternately\r\nmoistened with rain and again dried.  Those which have flowed during rain\r\ndown a slope, disintegrate in the same manner.  Such pellets often roll a\r\nlittle down any sloping surface; their descent being sometimes much aided\r\nby the wind.  The whole bottom of a broad dry ditch in my grounds, where\r\nthere were very few fresh castings, was completely covered with these\r\npellets or disintegrated castings, which had rolled down the steep sides,\r\ninclined at an angle of 27°.\r\n\r\nNear Nice, in places where the great cylindrical castings, previously\r\ndescribed, abound, the soil consists of very fine arenaceo-calcareous\r\nloam; and Dr. King informs me that these castings are extremely liable to\r\ncrumble during dry weather into small fragments, which are soon acted on\r\nby rain, and then sink down so as to be no longer distinguishable from\r\nthe surrounding soil.  He sent me a mass of such disintegrated castings,\r\ncollected on the top of a bank, where none could have rolled down from\r\nabove.  They must have been ejected within the previous five or six\r\nmonths, but they now consisted of more or less rounded fragments of all\r\nsizes, from ¾ of an inch in diameter to minute grains and mere dust.  Dr.\r\nKing witnessed the crumbling process whilst drying some perfect castings,\r\nwhich he afterwards sent me.  Mr. Scott also remarks on the crumbling of\r\nthe castings near Calcutta and on the mountains of Sikkim during the hot\r\nand dry season.\r\n\r\nWhen the castings near Nice had been ejected on an inclined surface, the\r\ndisintegrated fragments rolled downwards, without losing their\r\ndistinctive shape; and in some places could “be collected in basketfuls.”\r\nDr. King observed a striking instance of this fact on the Corniche road,\r\nwhere a drain, about 2½ feet wide and 9 inches deep, had been made to\r\ncatch the surface drainage from the adjoining hill-side.  The bottom of\r\nthis drain was covered for a distance of several hundred yards, to a\r\ndepth of from 1½ to 3 inches, by a layer of broken castings, still\r\nretaining their characteristic shape.  Nearly all these innumerable\r\nfragments had rolled down from above, for extremely few castings had been\r\nejected in the drain itself.  The hill-side was steep, but varied much in\r\ninclination, which Dr. King estimated at from 30° to 60° with the\r\nhorizon.  He climbed up the slope, and “found every here and there little\r\nembankments, formed by fragments of the castings that had been arrested\r\nin their downward progress by irregularities of the surface, by stones,\r\ntwigs, &c.  One little group of plants of _Anemone hortensis_ had acted\r\nin this manner, and quite a small bank of soil had collected round it.\r\nMuch of this soil had crumbled down, but a great deal of it still\r\nretained the form of castings.”  Dr. King dug up this plant, and was\r\nstruck with the thickness of the soil which must have recently\r\naccumulated over the crown of the rhizoma, as shown by the length of the\r\nbleached petioles, in comparison with those of other plants of the same\r\nkind, where there had been no such accumulation.  The earth thus\r\naccumulated had no doubt been secured (as I have everywhere seen) by the\r\nsmaller roots of the plants.  After describing this and other analogous\r\ncases, Dr. King concludes: “I can have no doubt that worms help greatly\r\nin the process of denudation.”\r\n\r\n_Ledges of earth on steep hill-sides_.—Little horizontal ledges, one\r\nabove another, have been observed on steep grassy slopes in many parts of\r\nthe world.  The formation has been attributed to animals travelling\r\nrepeatedly along the slope in the same horizontal lines while grazing,\r\nand that they do thus move and use the ledges is certain; but Professor\r\nHenslow (a most careful observer) told Sir J. Hooker that he was\r\nconvinced that this was not the sole cause of their formation.  Sir J.\r\nHooker saw such ledges on the Himalayan and Atlas ranges, where there\r\nwere no domesticated animals and not many wild ones; but these latter\r\nwould, it is probable, use the ledges at night while grazing like our\r\ndomesticated animals.  A friend observed for me the ledges on the Alps of\r\nSwitzerland, and states that they ran at 3 or 4 ft. one above the other,\r\nand were about a foot in breadth.  They had been deeply pitted by the\r\nfeet of grazing cows.  Similar ledges were observed by the same friend on\r\nour Chalk downs, and on an old talus of chalk-fragments (thrown out of a\r\nquarry) which had become clothed with turf.\r\n\r\nMy son Francis examined a Chalk escarpment near Lewes; and here on a part\r\nwhich was very steep, sloping at 40° with the horizon, about 30 flat\r\nledges extended horizontally for more than 100 yards, at an average\r\ndistance of about 20 inches, one beneath the other.  They were from 9 to\r\n10 inches in breadth.  When viewed from a distance they presented a\r\nstriking appearance, owing to their parallelism; but when examined\r\nclosely, they were seen to be somewhat sinuous, and one often ran into\r\nanother, giving the appearance of the ledge having forked into two.  They\r\nare formed of light-coloured earth, which on the outside, where thickest,\r\nwas in one case 9 inches, and in another case between 6 and 7 inches in\r\nthickness.  Above the ledges, the thickness of the earth over the chalk\r\nwas in the former case 4 and in the latter only 3 inches.  The grass grew\r\nmore vigorously on the outer edges of the ledges than on any other part\r\nof the slope, and here formed a tufted fringe.  Their middle part was\r\nbare, but whether this had been caused by the trampling of sheep, which\r\nsometimes frequent the ledges, my son could not ascertain.  Nor could he\r\nfeel sure how much of the earth on the middle and bare parts, consisted\r\nof disintegrated worm-castings which had rolled down from above; but he\r\nfelt convinced that some had thus originated; and it was manifest that\r\nthe ledges with their grass-fringed edges would arrest any small object\r\nrolling down from above.\r\n\r\nAt one end or side of the bank bearing these ledges, the surface\r\nconsisted in parts of bare chalk, and here the ledges were very\r\nirregular.  At the other end of the bank, the slope suddenly became less\r\nsteep, and here the ledges ceased rather abruptly; but little embankments\r\nonly a foot or two in length were still present.  The slope became\r\nsteeper lower down the hill, and the regular ledges then reappeared.\r\nAnother of my sons observed, on the inland side of Beachy Head, where the\r\nsurface sloped at about 25°, many short little embankments like those\r\njust mentioned.  They extended horizontally and were from a few inches to\r\ntwo or three feet in length.  They supported tufts of grass growing\r\nvigorously.  The average thickness of the mould of which they were\r\nformed, taken from nine measurements, was 4.5 inches; while that of the\r\nmould above and beneath them was on an average only 3.2 inches, and on\r\neach side, on the same level, 3.1 inches.  On the upper parts of the\r\nslope, these embankments showed no signs of having been trampled on by\r\nsheep, but in the lower parts such signs were fairly plain.  No long\r\ncontinuous ledges had here been formed.\r\n\r\nIf the little embankments above the Corniche road, which Dr. King saw in\r\nthe act of formation by the accumulation of disintegrated and rolled\r\nworm-castings, were to become confluent along horizontal lines, ledges\r\nwould be formed.  Each embankment would tend to extend laterally by the\r\nlateral extension of the arrested castings; and animals grazing on a\r\nsteep slope would almost certainly make use of every prominence at nearly\r\nthe same level, and would indent the turf between them; and such\r\nintermediate indentations would again arrest the castings.  An irregular\r\nledge when once formed would also tend to become more regular and\r\nhorizontal by some of the castings rolling laterally from the higher to\r\nthe lower parts, which would thus be raised.  Any projection beneath a\r\nledge would not afterwards receive disintegrated matter from above, and\r\nwould tend to be obliterated by rain and other atmospheric agencies.\r\nThere is some analogy between the formation, as here supposed, of these\r\nledges, and that of the ripples of wind-drifted sand as described by\r\nLyell. {259}\r\n\r\nThe steep, grass-covered sides of a mountainous valley in Westmoreland,\r\ncalled Grisedale, was marked in many places with innumerable lines of\r\nminiature cliffs, with almost horizontal, little ledges at their bases.\r\nTheir formation was in no way connected with the action of worms, for\r\ncastings could not anywhere be seen (and their absence is an inexplicable\r\nfact), although the turf lay in many places over a considerable thickness\r\nof boulder-clay and moraine rubbish.  Nor, as far as I could judge, was\r\nthe formation of these little cliffs at all closely connected with the\r\ntrampling of cows or sheep.  It appeared as if the whole superficial,\r\nsomewhat argillaceous earth, while partially held together by the roots\r\nof the grasses, had slided a little way down the mountain sides; and in\r\nthus sliding, had yielded and cracked in horizontal lines, transversely\r\nto the slope.\r\n\r\n_Castings blown to leeward by the wind_.—We have seen that moist castings\r\nflow, and that disintegrated castings roll down any inclined surface; and\r\nwe shall now see that castings, recently ejected on level grass-covered\r\nsurfaces, are blown during gales of wind accompanied by rain to leeward.\r\nThis has been observed by me many times on many fields during several\r\nsuccessive years.  After such gales, the castings present a gently\r\ninclined and smooth, or sometimes furrowed, surface to windward, while\r\nthey are steeply inclined or precipitous to leeward, so that they\r\nresemble on a miniature scale glacier-ground hillocks of rock.  They are\r\noften cavernous on the leeward side, from the upper part having curled\r\nover the lower part.  During one unusually heavy south-west gale with\r\ntorrents of rain, many castings were wholly blown to leeward, so that the\r\nmouths of the burrows were left naked and exposed on the windward side.\r\nRecent castings naturally flow down an inclined surface, but on a grassy\r\nfield, which sloped between 10° and 15°, several were found after a heavy\r\ngale blown up the slope.  This likewise occurred on another occasion on a\r\npart of my lawn where the slope was somewhat less.  On a third occasion,\r\nthe castings on the steep, grass-covered sides of a valley, down which a\r\ngale had blown, were directed obliquely instead of straight down the\r\nslope; and this was obviously due to the combined action of the wind and\r\ngravity.  Four castings on my lawn, where the downward inclination was 0°\r\n45′, 1°, 3° and 3° 30′ (mean 2° 45′) towards the north-east, after a\r\nheavy south-west gale with rain, were divided across the mouths of the\r\nburrows and weighed in the manner formerly described.  The mean weight of\r\nthe earth below the mouths of burrows and to leeward, was to that above\r\nthe mouths and on the windward side as 2¾ to 1; whereas we have seen that\r\nwith several castings which had flowed down slopes having a mean\r\ninclination of 9° 26′, and with three castings where the inclination was\r\nabove 12°; the proportional weight of the earth below to that above the\r\nburrows was as only 2 to 1.  These several cases show how efficiently\r\ngales of wind accompanied by rain act in displacing recently ejected\r\ncastings.  We may therefore conclude that even a moderately strong wind\r\nwill produce some slight effect on them.\r\n\r\nDry and indurated castings, after their disintegration into small\r\nfragments or pellets, are sometimes, probably often, blown by a strong\r\nwind to leeward.  This was observed on four occasions, but I did not\r\nsufficiently attend to this point.  One old casting on a gently sloping\r\nbank was blown quite away by a strong south-west wind.  Dr. King believes\r\nthat the wind removes the greater part of the old crumbling castings near\r\nNice.  Several old castings on my lawn were marked with pins and\r\nprotected from any disturbance.  They were examined after an interval of\r\n10 weeks, during which time the weather had been alternately dry and\r\nrainy.  Some, which were of a yellowish colour had been washed almost\r\ncompletely away, as could be seen by the colour of the surrounding\r\nground.  Others had completely disappeared, and these no doubt had been\r\nblown away.  Lastly, others still remained and would long remain, as\r\nblades of grass had grown through them.  On poor pasture-land, which has\r\nnever been rolled and has not been much trampled on by animals, the whole\r\nsurface is sometimes dotted with little pimples, through and on which\r\ngrass grows; and these pimples consist of old worm-castings.\r\n\r\nIn all the many observed cases of soft castings blown to leeward, this\r\nhad been effected by strong winds accompanied by rain.  As such winds in\r\nEngland generally blow from the south and south-west, earth must on the\r\nwhole tend to travel over our fields in a north and north-east direction.\r\nThis fact is interesting, because it might be thought that none could be\r\nremoved from a level, grass-covered surface by any means.  In thick and\r\nlevel woods, protected from the wind, castings will never be removed as\r\nlong as the wood lasts; and mould will here tend to accumulate to the\r\ndepth at which worms can work.  I tried to procure evidence as to how\r\nmuch mould is blown, whilst in the state of castings, by our wet southern\r\ngales to the north-east, over open and flat land, by looking to the level\r\nof the surface on opposite sides of old trees and hedge-rows; but I\r\nfailed owing to the unequal growth of the roots of trees and to most\r\npasture-land having been formerly ploughed.\r\n\r\nOn an open plain near Stonehenge, there exist shallow circular trenches,\r\nwith a low embankment outside, surrounding level spaces 50 yards in\r\ndiameter.  These rings appear very ancient, and are believed to be\r\ncontemporaneous with the Druidical stones.  Castings ejected within these\r\ncircular spaces, if blown to the north-east by south-west winds would\r\nform a layer of mould within the trench, thicker on the north-eastern\r\nthan on any other side.  But the site was not favourable for the action\r\nof worms, for the mould over the surrounding Chalk formation with flints,\r\nwas only 3.37 inches in thickness, from a mean of six observations made\r\nat a distance of 10 yards outside the embankment.  The thickness of the\r\nmould within two of the circular trenches was measured every 5 yards all\r\nround, on the inner sides near the bottom.  My son Horace protracted\r\nthese measurements on paper; and though the curved line representing the\r\nthickness of the mould was extremely irregular, yet in both diagrams it\r\ncould be seen to be thicker on the north-eastern side than elsewhere.\r\nWhen a mean of all the measurements in both the trenches was laid down\r\nand the line smoothed, it was obvious that the mould was thickest in the\r\nquarter of the circle between north-west and north-east; and thinnest in\r\nthe quarter between south-east and south-west, especially at this latter\r\npoint.  Besides the foregoing measurements, six others were taken near\r\ntogether in one of the circular trenches, on the north-east side; and the\r\nmould here had a mean thickness of 2.29 inches; while the mean of six\r\nother measurements on the south-west side was only 1.46 inches.  These\r\nobservations indicate that the castings had been blown by the south-west\r\nwinds from the circular enclosed space into the trench on the north-east\r\nside; but many more measurements in other analogous cases would be\r\nrequisite for a trustworthy result.\r\n\r\nThe amount of fine earth brought to the surface under the form of\r\ncastings, and afterwards transported by the winds accompanied by rain, or\r\nthat which flows and rolls down an inclined surface, no doubt is small in\r\nthe course of a few scores of years; for otherwise all the inequalities\r\nin our pasture fields would be smoothed within a much shorter period than\r\nappears to be the case.  But the amount which is thus transported in the\r\ncourse of thousands of years cannot fail to be considerable and deserves\r\nattention.  É. de Beaumont looks at the vegetable mould which everywhere\r\ncovers the land as a fixed line, from which the amount of denudation may\r\nbe measured. {265}  He ignores the continued formation of fresh mould by\r\nthe disintegration of the underlying rocks and fragments of rock; and it\r\nis curious to find how much more philosophical were the views maintained\r\nlong ago, by Playfair, who, in 1802, wrote, “In the permanence of a coat\r\nof vegetable mould on the surface of the earth, we have a demonstrative\r\nproof of the continued destruction of the rocks.” {266}\r\n\r\n_Ancient encampments and tumuli_.—É. de Beaumont adduces the present\r\nstate of many ancient encampments and tumuli and of old ploughed fields,\r\nas evidence that the surface of the land undergoes hardly any\r\ndegradation.  But it does not appear that he ever examined the thickness\r\nof the mould over different parts of such old remains.  He relies chiefly\r\non indirect, but apparently trustworthy, evidence that the slopes of the\r\nold embankments are the same as they originally were; and it is obvious\r\nthat he could know nothing about their original heights.  In Knole Park a\r\nmound had been thrown up behind the rifle-targets, which appeared to have\r\nbeen formed of earth originally supported by square blocks of turf.  The\r\nsides sloped, as nearly as I could estimate them, at an angle of 45° or\r\n50° with the horizon, and they were covered, especially on the northern\r\nside, with long coarse grass, beneath which many worm-castings were\r\nfound.  These had flowed bodily downwards, and others had rolled down as\r\npellets.  Hence it is certain that as long as a mound of this kind is\r\ntenanted by worms, its height will be continually lowered.  The fine\r\nearth which flows or rolls down the sides of such a mound accumulates at\r\nits base in the form of a talus.  A bed, even a very thin bed, of fine\r\nearth is eminently favourable for worms; so that a greater number of\r\ncastings would tend to be ejected on a talus thus formed than elsewhere;\r\nand these would be partially washed away by every heavy shower and be\r\nspread over the adjoining level ground.  The final result would be the\r\nlowering of the whole mound, whilst the inclination of the sides would\r\nnot be greatly lessened.  The same result would assuredly follow with\r\nancient embankments and tumuli; except where they had been formed of\r\ngravel or of nearly pure sand, as such matter is unfavourable for worms.\r\nMany old fortifications and tumuli are believed to be at least 2000 years\r\nold; and we should bear in mind that in many places about one inch of\r\nmould is brought to the surface in 5 years or two inches in 10 years.\r\nTherefore in so long a period as 2000 years, a large amount of earth will\r\nhave been repeatedly brought to the surface on most old embankments and\r\ntumuli, especially on the talus round their bases, and much of this earth\r\nwill have been washed completely away.  We may therefore conclude that\r\nall ancient mounds, when not formed of materials unfavourable to worms,\r\nwill have been somewhat lowered in the course of centuries, although\r\ntheir inclinations may not have been greatly changed.\r\n\r\n_Fields formerly ploughed_.—From a very remote period and in many\r\ncountries, land has been ploughed, so that convex beds, called crowns or\r\nridges, usually about 8 feet across and separated by furrows, have been\r\nthrown up.  The furrows are directed so as to carry off the surface\r\nwater.  In my attempts to ascertain how long a time these crowns and\r\nfurrows last, when ploughed land has been converted into pasture,\r\nobstacles of many kinds were encountered.  It is rarely known when a\r\nfield was last ploughed; and some fields which were thought to have been\r\nin pasture from time immemorial were afterwards discovered to have been\r\nploughed only 50 or 60 years before.  During the early part of the\r\npresent century, when the price of corn was very high, land of all kinds\r\nseems to have been ploughed in Britain.  There is, however, no reason to\r\ndoubt that in many cases the old crowns and furrows have been preserved\r\nfrom a very ancient period. {269}  That they should have been preserved\r\nfor very unequal lengths of time would naturally follow from the crowns,\r\nwhen first thrown up, having differed much in height in different\r\ndistricts, as is now the case with recently ploughed land.\r\n\r\nIn old pasture fields, the mould, wherever measurements were made, was\r\nfound to be from ½ to 2 inches thicker in the furrows than on the crowns;\r\nbut this would naturally follow from the finer earth having been washed\r\nfrom the crowns into the furrows before the land was well clothed with\r\nturf; and it is impossible to tell what part worms may have played in the\r\nwork.  Nevertheless from what we have seen, castings would certainly tend\r\nto flow and to be washed during heavy rain from the crowns into the\r\nfurrows.  But as soon as a bed of fine earth had by any means been\r\naccumulated in the furrows, it would be more favourable for worms than\r\nthe other parts, and a greater number of castings would be thrown up here\r\nthan elsewhere; and as the furrows on sloping land are usually directed\r\nso as to carry off the surface water, some of the finest earth would be\r\nwashed from the castings which had been here ejected and be carried\r\ncompletely away.  The result would be that the furrows would be filled up\r\nvery slowly, while the crowns would be lowered perhaps still more slowly\r\nby the flowing and rolling of the castings down their gentle inclinations\r\ninto the furrows.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it might be expected that old furrows, especially those on a\r\nsloping surface, would in the course of time be filled up and disappear.\r\nSome careful observers, however, who examined fields for me in\r\nGloucestershire and Staffordshire could not detect any difference in the\r\nstate of the furrows in the upper and lower parts of sloping fields,\r\nsupposed to have been long in pasture; and they came to the conclusion\r\nthat the crowns and furrows would last for an almost endless number of\r\ncenturies.  On the other hand the process of obliteration seems to have\r\ncommenced in some places.  Thus in a grass field in North Wales, known to\r\nhave been ploughed about 65 years ago, which sloped at an angle of 15° to\r\nthe north-east, the depth of the furrows (only 7 feet apart) was\r\ncarefully measured, and was found to be about 4½ inches in the upper part\r\nof the slope, and only 1 inch near the base, where they could be traced\r\nwith difficulty.  On another field sloping at about the same angle to the\r\nsouth-west, the furrows were scarcely perceptible in the lower part;\r\nalthough these same furrows when followed on to some adjoining level\r\nground were from 2½ to 3½ inches in depth.  A third and closely similar\r\ncase was observed.  In a fourth case, the mould in a furrow in the upper\r\npart of a sloping field was 2½ inches, and in the lower part 4½ inches in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nOn the Chalk Downs at about a mile distance from Stonehenge, my son\r\nWilliam examined a grass-covered, furrowed surface, sloping at from 8° to\r\n10 °, which an old shepherd said had not been ploughed within the memory\r\nof man.  The depth of one furrow was measured at 16 points in a length of\r\n68 paces, and was found to be deeper where the slope was greatest and\r\nwhere less earth would naturally tend to accumulate, and at the base it\r\nalmost disappeared.  The thickness of the mould in this furrow in the\r\nupper part was 2½ inches, which increased to 5 inches, a little above the\r\nsteepest part of the slope; and at the base, in the middle of the narrow\r\nvalley, at a point which the furrow if continued would have struck, it\r\namounted to 7 inches.  On the opposite side of the valley, there were\r\nvery faint, almost obliterated, traces of furrows.  Another analogous but\r\nnot so decided a case was observed at a few miles’ distance from\r\nStonehenge.  On the whole it appears that the crowns and furrows on land\r\nformerly ploughed, but now covered with grass, tend slowly to disappear\r\nwhen the surface is inclined; and this is probably in large part due to\r\nthe action of worms; but that the crowns and furrows last for a very long\r\ntime when the surface is nearly level.\r\n\r\n_Formation and amount of mould over the Chalk Formation_.—Worm-castings\r\nare often ejected in extraordinary numbers on steep, grass-covered\r\nslopes, where the Chalk comes close to the surface, as my son William\r\nobserved near Winchester and elsewhere.  If such castings are largely\r\nwashed away during heavy rains, it is difficult to understand at first\r\nhow any mould can still remain on our Downs, as there does not appear any\r\nevident means for supplying the loss.  There is, moreover, another cause\r\nof loss, namely, in the percolation of the finer particles of earth into\r\nthe fissures in the chalk and into the chalk itself.  These\r\nconsiderations led me to doubt for a time whether I had not exaggerated\r\nthe amount of fine earth which flows or rolls down grass-covered slopes\r\nunder the form of castings; and I sought for additional information.  In\r\nsome places, the castings on Chalk Downs consist largely of calcareous\r\nmatter, and here the supply is of course unlimited.  But in other places,\r\nfor instance on a part of Teg Down near Winchester, the castings were all\r\nblack and did not effervesce with acids.  The mould over the chalk was\r\nhere only from 3 to 4 inches in thickness.  So again on the plain near\r\nStonehenge, the mould, apparently free from calcareous matter, averaged\r\nrather less than 3½ inches in thickness.  Why worms should penetrate and\r\nbring up chalk in some places and not in others I do not know.\r\n\r\nIn many districts where the land is nearly level, a bed several feet in\r\nthickness of red clay full of unworn flints overlies the Upper Chalk.\r\nThis overlying matter, the surface of which has been converted into\r\nmould, consists of the undissolved residue from the chalk.  It may be\r\nwell here to recall the case of the fragments of chalk buried beneath\r\nworm-castings on one of my fields, the angles of which were so completely\r\nrounded in the course of 29 years that the fragments now resembled\r\nwater-worn pebbles.  This must have been effected by the carbonic acid in\r\nthe rain and in the ground, by the humus-acids, and by the corroding\r\npower of living roots.  Why a thick mass of residue has not been left on\r\nthe Chalk, wherever the land is nearly level, may perhaps be accounted\r\nfor by the percolation of the fine particles into the fissures, which are\r\noften present in the chalk and are either open or are filled up with\r\nimpure chalk, or into the solid chalk itself.  That such percolation\r\noccurs can hardly be doubted.  My son collected some powdered and\r\nfragmentary chalk beneath the turf near Winchester; the former was found\r\nby Colonel Parsons, R. E., to contain 10 per cent., and the fragments 8\r\nper cent. of earthy matter.  On the flanks of the escarpment near Abinger\r\nin Surrey, some chalk close beneath a layer of flints, 2 inches in\r\nthickness and covered by 8 inches of mould, yielded a residue of 3.7 per\r\ncent. of earthy matter.  On the other hand the Upper Chalk properly\r\ncontains, as I was informed by the late David Forbes who had made many\r\nanalyses, only from 1 to 2 per cent. of earthy matter; and two samples\r\nfrom pits near my house contained 1.3 and 0.6 per cent.  I mention these\r\nlatter cases because, from the thickness of the overlying bed of red clay\r\nwith flints, I had imagined that the underlying chalk might here be less\r\npure than elsewhere.  The cause of the residue accumulating more in some\r\nplaces than in others, may be attributed to a layer of argillaceous\r\nmatter having been left at an early period on the chalk, and this would\r\ncheck the subsequent percolation of earthy matter into it.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts now given we may conclude that castings ejected on our\r\nChalk Downs suffer some loss by the percolation of their finer matter\r\ninto the chalk.  But such impure superficial chalk, when dissolved, would\r\nleave a larger supply of earthy matter to be added to the mould than in\r\nthe case of pure chalk.  Besides the loss caused by percolation, some\r\nfine earth is certainly washed down the sloping grass-covered surfaces of\r\nour Downs.  The washing-down process, however, will be checked in the\r\ncourse of time; for although I do not know how thin a layer of mould\r\nsuffices to support worms, yet a limit must at last be reached; and then\r\ntheir castings would cease to be ejected or would become scanty.\r\n\r\nThe following cases show that a considerable quantity of fine earth is\r\nwashed down.  The thickness of the mould was measured at points 12 yards\r\napart across a small valley in the Chalk near Winchester.  The sides\r\nsloped gently at first; then became inclined at about 20°; then more\r\ngently to near the bottom, which transversely was almost level and about\r\n50 yards across.  In the bottom, the mean thickness of the mould from\r\nfive measurements was 8.3 inches; whilst on the sides of the valley,\r\nwhere the inclination varied between 14° and 20°, its mean thickness was\r\nrather less than 3.5 inches.  As the turf-covered bottom of the valley\r\nsloped at an angle of only between 2° and 3°, it is probable that most of\r\nthe 8.3-inch layer of mould had been washed down from the flanks of the\r\nvalley, and not from the upper part.  But as a shepherd said that he had\r\nseen water flowing in this valley after the sudden thawing of snow, it is\r\npossible that some earth may have been brought down from the upper part;\r\nor, on the other hand, that some may have been carried further down the\r\nvalley.  Closely similar results, with respect to the thickness of the\r\nmould, were obtained in a neighbouring valley.\r\n\r\nSt. Catherine’s Hill, near Winchester, is 327 feet in height, and\r\nconsists of a steep cone of chalk about ¼ of a mile in diameter.  The\r\nupper part was converted by the Romans, or, as some think, by the ancient\r\nBritons, into an encampment, by the excavation of a deep and broad ditch\r\nall round it.  Most of the chalk removed during the work was thrown\r\nupwards, by which a projecting bank was formed; and this effectually\r\nprevents worm-castings (which are numerous in parts), stones, and other\r\nobjects from being washed or rolled into the ditch.  The mould on the\r\nupper and fortified part of the hill was found to be in most places only\r\nfrom 2½ to 3½ inches in thickness; whereas it had accumulated at the foot\r\nof the embankment above the ditch to a thickness in most places of from 8\r\nto 9½ inches.  On the embankment itself the mould was only 1 to 1½ inch\r\nin thickness; and within the ditch at the bottom it varied from 2½ to 3½,\r\nbut was in one spot 6 inches in thickness.  On the north-west side of the\r\nhill, either no embankment had ever been thrown up above the ditch, or it\r\nhad subsequently been removed; so that here there was nothing to prevent\r\nworm-castings, earth and stones being washed into the ditch, at the\r\nbottom of which the mould formed a layer from 11 to 22 inches in\r\nthickness.  It should however be stated that here and on other parts of\r\nthe slope, the bed of mould often contained fragments of chalk and flint\r\nwhich had obviously rolled down at different times from above.  The\r\ninterstices in the underlying fragmentary chalk were also filled up with\r\nmould.\r\n\r\nMy son examined the surface of this hill to its base in a south-west\r\ndirection.  Beneath the great ditch, where the slope was about 24°, the\r\nmould was very thin, namely, from 1½ to 2½ inches; whilst near the base,\r\nwhere the slope was only 3° to 4°, it increased to between 8 and 9 inches\r\nin thickness.  We may therefore conclude that on this artificially\r\nmodified hill, as well as in the natural valleys of the neighbouring\r\nChalk Downs, some fine earth, probably derived in large part from\r\nworm-castings, is washed down, and accumulates in the lower parts,\r\nnotwithstanding the percolation of an unknown quantity into the\r\nunderlying chalk; a supply of fresh earthy matter being afforded by the\r\ndissolution of the chalk through atmospheric and other agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary of the part which worms have played in the history of the\r\nworld—Their aid in the disintegration of rocks—In the denudation of the\r\nland—In the preservation of ancient remains—In the preparation of the\r\nsoil for the growth of plants—Mental powers of worms—Conclusion.\r\n\r\nWORMS have played a more important part in the history of the world than\r\nmost persons would at first suppose.  In almost all humid countries they\r\nare extraordinarily numerous, and for their size possess great muscular\r\npower.  In many parts of England a weight of more than ten tons (10,516\r\nkilogrammes) of dry earth annually passes through their bodies and is\r\nbrought to the surface on each acre of land; so that the whole\r\nsuperficial bed of vegetable mould passes through their bodies in the\r\ncourse of every few years.  From the collapsing of the old burrows the\r\nmould is in constant though slow movement, and the particles composing it\r\nare thus rubbed together.  By these means fresh surfaces are continually\r\nexposed to the action of the carbonic acid in the soil, and of the\r\nhumus-acids which appear to be still more efficient in the decomposition\r\nof rocks.  The generation of the humus-acids is probably hastened during\r\nthe digestion of the many half-decayed leaves which worms consume.  Thus\r\nthe particles of earth, forming the superficial mould, are subjected to\r\nconditions eminently favourable for their decomposition and\r\ndisintegration.  Moreover, the particles of the softer rocks suffer some\r\namount of mechanical trituration in the muscular gizzards of worms, in\r\nwhich small stones serve as mill-stones.\r\n\r\nThe finely levigated castings, when brought to the surface in a moist\r\ncondition, flow during rainy weather down any moderate slope; and the\r\nsmaller particles are washed far down even a gently inclined surface.\r\nCastings when dry often crumble into small pellets and these are apt to\r\nroll down any sloping surface.  Where the land is quite level and is\r\ncovered with herbage, and where the climate is humid so that much dust\r\ncannot be blown away, it appears at first sight impossible that there\r\nshould be any appreciable amount of sub-aerial denudation; but\r\nworm-castings are blown, especially whilst moist and viscid, in one\r\nuniform direction by the prevalent winds which are accompanied by rain.\r\nBy these several means the superficial mould is prevented from\r\naccumulating to a great thickness; and a thick bed of mould checks in\r\nmany ways the disintegration of the underlying rocks and fragments of\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nThe removal of worm-castings by the above means leads to results which\r\nare far from insignificant.  It has been shown that a layer of earth, 0.2\r\nof an inch in thickness, is in many places annually brought to the\r\nsurface; and if a small part of this amount flows, or rolls, or is\r\nwashed, even for a short distance, down every inclined surface, or is\r\nrepeatedly blown in one direction, a great effect will be produced in the\r\ncourse of ages.  It was found by measurements and calculations that on a\r\nsurface with a mean inclination of 9° 26′, 2.4 cubic inches of earth\r\nwhich had been ejected by worms crossed, in the course of a year, a\r\nhorizontal line one yard in length; so that 240 cubic inches would cross\r\na line 100 yards in length.  This latter amount in a damp state would\r\nweigh 11½ pounds.  Thus a considerable weight of earth is continually\r\nmoving down each side of every valley, and will in time reach its bed.\r\nFinally this earth will be transported by the streams flowing in the\r\nvalleys into the ocean, the great receptacle for all matter denuded from\r\nthe land.  It is known from the amount of sediment annually delivered\r\ninto the sea by the Mississippi, that its enormous drainage-area must on\r\nan average be lowered .00263 of an inch each year; and this would suffice\r\nin four and half million years to lower the whole drainage-area to the\r\nlevel of the sea-shore.  So that, if a small fraction of the layer of\r\nfine earth, 0.2 of an inch in thickness, which is annually brought to the\r\nsurface by worms, is carried away, a great result cannot fail to be\r\nproduced within a period which no geologist considers extremely long.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nArchæologists ought to be grateful to worms, as they protect and preserve\r\nfor an indefinitely long period every object, not liable to decay, which\r\nis dropped on the surface of the land, by burying it beneath their\r\ncastings.  Thus, also, many elegant and curious tesselated pavements and\r\nother ancient remains have been preserved; though no doubt the worms have\r\nin these cases been largely aided by earth washed and blown from the\r\nadjoining land, especially when cultivated.  The old tesselated pavements\r\nhave, however, often suffered by having subsided unequally from being\r\nunequally undermined by the worms.  Even old massive walls may be\r\nundermined and subside; and no building is in this respect safe, unless\r\nthe foundations lie 6 or 7 feet beneath the surface, at a depth at which\r\nworms cannot work.  It is probable that many monoliths and some old walls\r\nhave fallen down from having been undermined by worms.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nWorms prepare the ground {284} in an excellent manner for the growth of\r\nfibrous-rooted plants and for seedlings of all kinds.  They periodically\r\nexpose the mould to the air, and sift it so that no stones larger than\r\nthe particles which they can swallow are left in it.  They mingle the\r\nwhole intimately together, like a gardener who prepares fine soil for his\r\nchoicest plants.  In this state it is well fitted to retain moisture and\r\nto absorb all soluble substances, as well as for the process of\r\nnitrification.  The bones of dead animals, the harder parts of insects,\r\nthe shells of land-molluscs, leaves, twigs, &c., are before long all\r\nburied beneath the accumulated castings of worms, and are thus brought in\r\na more or less decayed state within reach of the roots of plants.  Worms\r\nlikewise drag an infinite number of dead leaves and other parts of plants\r\ninto their burrows, partly for the sake of plugging them up and partly as\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe leaves which are dragged into the burrows as food, after being torn\r\ninto the finest shreds, partially digested, and saturated with the\r\nintestinal and urinary secretions, are commingled with much earth.  This\r\nearth forms the dark coloured, rich humus which almost everywhere covers\r\nthe surface of the land with a fairly well-defined layer or mantle.\r\nHensen {285} placed two worms in a vessel 18 inches in diameter, which\r\nwas filled with sand, on which fallen leaves were strewed; and these were\r\nsoon dragged into their burrows to a depth of 3 inches.  After about 6\r\nweeks an almost uniform layer of sand, a centimeter (0.4 inch) in\r\nthickness, was converted into humus by having passed through the\r\nalimentary canals of these two worms.  It is believed by some persons\r\nthat worm-burrows, which often penetrate the ground almost\r\nperpendicularly to a depth of 5 or 6 feet, materially aid in its\r\ndrainage; notwithstanding that the viscid castings piled over the mouths\r\nof the burrows prevent or check the rain-water directly entering them.\r\nThey allow the air to penetrate deeply into the ground.  They also\r\ngreatly facilitate the downward passage of roots of moderate size; and\r\nthese will be nourished by the humus with which the burrows are lined.\r\nMany seeds owe their germination to having been covered by castings; and\r\nothers buried to a considerable depth beneath accumulated castings lie\r\ndormant, until at some future time they are accidentally uncovered and\r\ngerminate.\r\n\r\nWorms are poorly provided with sense-organs, for they cannot be said to\r\nsee, although they can just distinguish between light and darkness; they\r\nare completely deaf, and have only a feeble power of smell; the sense of\r\ntouch alone is well developed.  They can therefore learn but little about\r\nthe outside world, and it is surprising that they should exhibit some\r\nskill in lining their burrows with their castings and with leaves, and in\r\nthe case of some species in piling up their castings into tower-like\r\nconstructions.  But it is far more surprising that they should apparently\r\nexhibit some degrees of intelligence instead of a mere blind instinctive\r\nimpulse, in their manner of plugging up the mouths of their burrows.\r\nThey act in nearly the same manner as would a man, who had to close a\r\ncylindrical tube with different kinds of leaves, petioles, triangles of\r\npaper, &c., for they commonly seize such objects by their pointed ends.\r\nBut with thin objects a certain number are drawn in by their broader\r\nends.  They do not act in the same unvarying manner in all cases, as do\r\nmost of the lower animals; for instance, they do not drag in leaves by\r\ntheir foot-stalks, unless the basal part of the blade is as narrow as the\r\napex, or narrower than it.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nWhen we behold a wide, turf-covered expanse, we should remember that its\r\nsmoothness, on which so much of its beauty depends, is mainly due to all\r\nthe inequalities having been slowly levelled by worms.  It is a\r\nmarvellous reflection that the whole of the superficial mould over any\r\nsuch expanse has passed, and will again pass, every few years through the\r\nbodies of worms.  The plough is one of the most ancient and most valuable\r\nof man’s inventions; but long before he existed the land was in fact\r\nregularly ploughed, and still continues to be thus ploughed by\r\nearth-worms.  It may be doubted whether there are many other animals\r\nwhich have played so important a part in the history of the world, as\r\nhave these lowly organized creatures.  Some other animals, however, still\r\nmore lowly organized, namely corals, have done far more conspicuous work\r\nin having constructed innumerable reefs and islands in the great oceans;\r\nbut these are almost confined to the tropical zones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n{2}  ‘Leçons de Géologie Pratique,’ tom. i. 1845, p. 140.\r\n\r\n{3}  ‘Transactions Geolog.

They were sent to M. Perrier,\r\nwho with great kindness examined and named them for me: they consisted of\r\n_Perichæta affinis_, a native of Cochin China and of the Philippines; _P.\r\nLuzonica_, a native of Luzon in the Philippines; and _P. Houlleti_, which\r\nlives near Calcutta.  M. Perrier informs me that species of Perichæta\r\nhave been naturalized in the gardens near Montpellier and in Algiers.\r\nBefore I had any reason to suspect that the tower-like castings from Nice\r\nhad been formed by worms not endemic in the country, I was greatly\r\nsurprised to see how closely they resembled castings sent to me from near\r\nCalcutta, where it is known that species of Perichæta abound.\r\n\r\n{102}  ‘Zeitschrift für wissenschaft.

Soc.’  (Vol. v. p. 505), and contains a serious error, as in the\r\naccount received I mistook the figure 30 for 80.  The tenant, moreover,\r\nformerly said that he had marled the field thirty years before, but was\r\nnow positive that this was done in 1809, that is twenty-eight years\r\nbefore the first examination of the field by my friend.  The error, as\r\nfar as the figure 80 is concerned, was corrected in an article by me, in\r\nthe ‘Gardeners’ Chronicle,’ 1844, p. 218.\r\n\r\n{128}  These pits or pipes are still in process of formation.  During the\r\nlast forty years I have seen or heard of five cases, in which a circular\r\nspace, several feet in diameter, suddenly fell in, leaving on the field\r\nan open hole with perpendicular sides, some feet in depth.  This occurred\r\nin one of my own fields, whilst it was being rolled, and the hinder\r\nquarters of the shaft horse fell in; two or three cart-loads of rubbish\r\nwere required to fill up the hole.  The subsidence occurred where there\r\nwas a broad depression, as if the surface had fallen in at several former\r\nperiods.  I heard of a hole which must have been suddenly formed at the\r\nbottom of a small shallow pool, where sheep had been washed during many\r\nyears, and into which a man thus occupied fell to his great terror.  The\r\nrain-water over this whole district sinks perpendicularly into the\r\nground, but the chalk is more porous in certain places than in others.\r\nThus the drainage from the overlying clay is directed to certain points,\r\nwhere a greater amount of calcareous matter is dissolved than elsewhere.\r\nEven narrow open channels are sometimes formed in the solid chalk.  As\r\nthe chalk is slowly dissolved over the whole country, but more in some\r\nparts than in others, the undissolved residue—that is the overlying mass\r\nof red clay with flints,—likewise sinks slowly down, and tends to fill up\r\nthe pipes or cavities.  But the upper part of the red clay holds\r\ntogether, aided probably by the roots of plants, for a longer time than\r\nthe lower parts, and thus forms a roof, which sooner or later falls in,\r\nas in the above mentioned five cases.  The downward movement of the clay\r\nmay be compared with that of a glacier, but is incomparably slower; and\r\nthis movement accounts for a singular fact, namely, that the much\r\nelongated flints which are embedded in the chalk in a nearly horizontal\r\nposition, are commonly found standing nearly or quite upright in the red\r\nclay.  This fact is so common that the workmen assured me that this was\r\ntheir natural position.  I roughly measured one which stood vertically,\r\nand it was of the same length and of the same relative thickness as one\r\nof my arms.  These elongated flints must get placed in their upright\r\nposition, on the same principle that a trunk of a tree left on a glacier\r\nassumes a position parallel to the line of motion.  The flints in the\r\nclay which form almost half its bulk, are very often broken, though not\r\nrolled or abraded; and this may be accounted for by their mutual\r\npressure, whilst the whole mass is subsiding.  I may add that the chalk\r\nhere appears to have been originally covered in parts by a thin bed of\r\nfine sand with some perfectly rounded flint pebbles, probably of Tertiary\r\nage; for such sand often partly fills up the deeper pits or cavities in\r\nthe chalk.\r\n\r\n{131}  S.

Lyell,\r\nremarks that Scotch farmers are afraid of putting lime on ploughed land\r\nuntil just before it is laid down for pasture, from a belief that it has\r\nsome tendency to sink.  He adds: “Some years since, in autumn, I laid\r\nlime on an oat-stubble and ploughed it down; thus bringing it into\r\nimmediate contact with the dead vegetable matter, and securing its\r\nthorough mixture through the means of all the subsequent operations of\r\nfallow.  In consequence of the above prejudice, I was considered to have\r\ncommitted a great fault; but the result was eminently successful, and the\r\npractice was _partially_ followed.  By means of Mr. Darwin’s\r\nobservations, I think the prejudice will be removed.”\r\n\r\n{139}  This conclusion, which, as we shall immediately see, is fully\r\njustified, is of some little importance, as the so-called bench-stones,\r\nwhich surveyors fix in the ground as a record of their levels, may in\r\ntime become false standards.

The amount of depression in some cases may be\r\nmeasured by feet.”  He instances the Tower of Pisa, but adds that it was\r\nfounded on “dense clay.”\r\n\r\n{148}  ‘Zeitschrift für wissensch.

For some recent\r\ninformation on the amount of sediment brought down by rivers, see\r\n‘Nature,’ Sept.  23rd, 1880.  Mr. T. Mellard Reade has published some\r\ninteresting articles on the astonishing amount of matter brought down in\r\nsolution by rivers.  See Address, Geolog. Soc., Liverpool, 1876–77.\r\n\r\n{213}  “An account of the fine dust which often falls on Vessels in the\r\nAtlantic Ocean,” Proc. Geolog. Soc. of London, June 4th, 1845.\r\n\r\n{215}  For La Plata, see my ‘Journal of Researches,’ during the voyage of\r\nthe _Beagle_, 1845, p. 133.  Élie de Beaumont has given (‘Leçons de\r\nGéolog. pratique,’ tom. I. 1845, p. 183) an excellent account of the\r\nenormous quantity of dust which is transported in some countries.  I\r\ncannot but think that Mr. Proctor has somewhat exaggerated (‘Pleasant\r\nWays in Science,’ 1879, p. 379) the agency of dust in a humid country\r\nlike Great Britain.  James Geikie has given (‘Prehistoric Europe,’ 1880,\r\np. 165) a full abstract of Richthofen’s views, which, however, he\r\ndisputes.\r\n\r\n{217a}  These statements are taken from Hensen in ‘Zeitschrift für\r\nwissenschaft. Zoologie.’ Bd. xxviii., 1877, p. 360.  Those with respect\r\nto peat are taken from Mr. A. A. Julien in ‘Proc. American Assoc.\r\nScience,’ 1879, p. 354.\r\n\r\n{217b}  I have given some facts on the climate necessary or favourable\r\nfor the formation of peat, in my ‘Journal of Researches,’ 1845, p. 287.\r\n\r\n{220}  A.

Johnson, ‘How Crops\r\nFeed,’ 1870, p. 326.\r\n\r\n{223}  This statement is taken from Mr. Julien, ‘Proc. American Assoc.\r\nScience,’ vol.  xxviii., 1879, p. 330.\r\n\r\n{224a}  The preservative power of a layer of mould and turf is often\r\nshown by the perfect state of the glacial scratches on rocks when first\r\nuncovered.  Mr. J. Geikie maintains, in his last very interesting work\r\n(‘Prehistoric Europe,’ 1881), that the more perfect scratches are\r\nprobably due to the last access of cold and increase of ice, during the\r\nlong-continued, intermittent glacial period.\r\n\r\n{224b}  Many geologists have felt much surprise at the complete\r\ndisappearance of flints over wide and nearly level areas, from which the\r\nchalk has been removed by subaerial denudation.  But the surface of every\r\nflint is coated by an opaque modified layer, which will just yield to a\r\nsteel point, whilst the freshly fractured, translucent surface will not\r\nthus yield.  The removal by atmospheric agencies of the outer modified\r\nsurfaces of freely exposed flints, though no doubt excessively slow,\r\ntogether with the modification travelling inwards, will, as may be\r\nsuspected, ultimately lead to their complete disintegration,\r\nnotwithstanding that they appear to be so extremely durable.\r\n\r\n{225a}  ‘Archives de Zoolog. expér.’ tom. iii. 1874, p. 409.\r\n\r\n{225b}  ‘Nouvelles Archives du Muséum,’ tom. viii. 1872, pp.  95, 131.\r\n\r\n{226}  Morren, in speaking of the earth in the alimentary canals of\r\nworms, says, “præsepè cum lapillis commixtam vidi:” ‘De Lumbrici\r\nterrestris Hist. Nat.’ &c., 1829, p. 16.\r\n\r\n{227}  Perrier, ‘Archives de Zoolog. expér.’ tom. iii. 1874, p. 419.\r\n\r\n{228a}  Morren, ‘De Lumbrici terrestris Hist.

This mud\r\nmust, as I believe (‘The Structure and Distribution of Coral-Reefs,’ 2nd\r\nedit. 1874, p. 19), be attributed to the innumerable annelids and other\r\nanimals which burrow into the dead coral, and to the fishes,\r\nHolothurians, &c., which browse on the living corals.\r\n\r\n{236}  Anniversary Address: ‘The Quarterly Journal of the Geological\r\nSoc.’ May 1880, p. 59.\r\n\r\n{244}  Mr. James Wallace has pointed out that it is necessary to take\r\ninto consideration the possibility of burrows being made at right angles\r\nto the surface instead of vertically down, in which case the lateral\r\ndisplacement of the soil would be increased.\r\n\r\n{259}  ‘Elements of Geology,’ 1865, p. 20.\r\n\r\n{265}  ‘Leçons de Géologie pratique, 1845; cinquième Leçon.  All Élie de\r\nBeaumont’s arguments are admirably controverted by Prof. A. Geikie in his\r\nessay in Transact. Geolog.

Tylor in his Presidential address (‘Journal of the\r\nAnthropological Institute,’ May 1880, p. 451) remarks: “It appears from\r\nseveral papers of the Berlin Society as to the German ‘high-fields’ or\r\n‘heathen-fields’ (Hochäcker, and Heidenäcker) that they correspond much\r\nin their situation on hills and wastes with the ‘elf-furrows’ of\r\nScotland, which popular mythology accounts for by the story of the fields\r\nhaving been put under a Papal interdict, so that people took to\r\ncultivating the hills.  There seems reason to suppose that, like the\r\ntilled plots in the Swedish forest which tradition ascribes to the old\r\n‘hackers,’ the German heathen-fields represent tillage by an ancient and\r\nbarbaric population.”\r\n\r\n{284}  White of Selborne has some good remarks on the service performed\r\nby worms in loosening, &c., the soil.
