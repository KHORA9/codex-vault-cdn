Plants and animals found nowhere else in\r\nthe 50 states are found here in abundance, though in an increasingly\r\nperilous state. In this handbook, first published in 1972, author and\r\nresearcher Jean Craighead George brings to the telling of this story\r\nlong years of study and understanding. Checklists and glossaries at the\r\nback buttress her account of the natural history of this national park.\r\n\r\nNational Park Handbooks, compact introductions to the great natural and\r\nhistoric places administered by the National Park Service, are published\r\nto support the National Park Service’s management programs at the parks\r\nand to promote understanding and enjoyment of the parks. Each is\r\nintended to be informative reading and a useful guide before, during,\r\nand after a park visit. More than 100 titles are in print. This is\r\nHandbook 143.

In a vast, shallow sheet this lazy\r\nriver idles through tall grasses and shadowy forests, easing over\r\nalligator holes and under bird rookeries, finally mingling with the\r\nsalty waters of Florida Bay and the Gulf of Mexico in the mangrove\r\nswamps. From source to sea, all across the shallow breadth of this\r\nwatery landscape, life abounds.\r\n\r\nEverglades National Park is to most Americans an Eden where birds,\r\nmammals, reptiles, and orchids find sanctuary. Sunshine sparkles on\r\nsloughs teeming with fish, and on marshes where wildflowers bloom the\r\nyear around; it shines on tree islands where birds roost and deer bed\r\ndown. In this semitropical garden of plant-and-animal communities, every\r\nbreeze-touched glade, every cluster of trees is a separate world in\r\nwhich are tucked yet smaller worlds of such complexity that even\r\necologists have not learned all their intricate relationships.\r\n\r\nThis book has been written to help you see how the many pieces of this\r\necological puzzle fit together to form a complex, ever-changing, closely\r\nwoven web of plants, animals, rock, soil, sun, water, and air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    AMERICA’S SUBTROPICAL WONDERLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nEverglades may not be our largest national park (that honor belongs to\r\nWrangell-St. Elias in Alaska), but it is certainly the wettest. During\r\nand after the rainy season, when not only the mangrove swamp but also\r\nthe sawgrass prairie is under water, most of the park abounds in fish\r\nand other water life, and even the white-tailed deer leads a\r\nsemi-aquatic existence.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that it is low, flat, and largely under water,\r\nEverglades is a park of many environments: shallow, key-dotted Florida\r\nBay; the coastal prairie; the vast mangrove forest and its mysterious\r\nwaterways; cypress swamps; the true everglades—an extensive freshwater\r\nmarsh dotted with tree islands and occasional ponds; and the driest\r\nzone, the pine-and-hammock rockland.\r\n\r\nThe watery expanse we call “everglades,” from which the park gets its\r\nname, lies only partly within the park boundaries. Originally this river\r\nflowed, unobstructed though very slowly, southward from Lake Okeechobee\r\nmore than 100 miles to Florida Bay. It is hardly recognizable as a\r\nriver, for it is 50 miles wide and averages only about 6 inches deep,\r\nand it creeps rather than flows. Its source, the area around Lake\r\nOkeechobee, is only about 15 feet above sea level, and the riverbed\r\nslopes southward only 2 or 3 inches to the mile.\r\n\r\nAs you can see by the maps on pages 2 and 3, the works of man have\r\ngreatly altered the drainage patterns and the natural values of south\r\nFlorida, and you can imagine how this has affected the supply of\r\nwater—the park’s lifeblood.\r\n\r\nThe park’s array of plants and animals is a blend of tropical species,\r\nmost of which made their way across the water from the Caribbean\r\nislands, and species from the Temperate Zone, which embraces all of\r\nFlorida. All of these inhabitants exist here through adaptation to the\r\nregion’s peculiar cycles of flood, drought, and fire and by virtue of\r\nsubtle variations in temperature, altitude, and soil.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: HISTORIC DRAINAGE PATTERNS OF SOUTH FLORIDA]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DRAINAGE PATTERNS OF SOUTH FLORIDA TODAY]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PLANT COMMUNITIES OF EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK\r\n\r\nThe horizontal distance represented on this diagram, from the Pineland\r\nto Florida Bay, is 15 miles. With a greatly exaggerated vertical scale,\r\nthe difference between the greatest elevation of the pine ridge and the\r\nbottom of the Florida Bay marl bed is only 14 feet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  FLORIDA BAY (SALT WATER)\r\n    MUD BANK\r\n    KEY\r\n  COASTAL PRAIRIE\r\n  MANGROVE SWAMP (BRACKISH)\r\n    BUTTONWOOD LEVEE\r\n  TREE-ISLAND GLADES (FRESH WATER)\r\n    BAYHEAD\r\n    CYPRESS HEAD\r\n    WILLOW HEAD\r\n    HARDWOOD HAMMOCK\r\n  PINE AND HAMMOCK RIDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderlying the entire park is porous limestone (_see_ glossary), which\r\nwas deposited ages ago in warm seas that covered the southern part of\r\ntoday’s Florida peninsula. Over this limestone only a thin mantle of\r\nmarl and peat provides soil for rooting plants.\r\n\r\nSome of the park’s ecosystems (_see_ glossary) are extremely complex.\r\nFor example, a single jungle hammock of a dozen acres may contain, along\r\nwith giant live oaks and other plants from the Temperate Zone, many\r\nkinds of tropical hardwood trees; a profusion of vines, mosses, ferns,\r\norchids, and air plants; and a great variety of vertebrate and\r\ninvertebrate animals, from tree snails to the white-tailed deer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Pine Rockland\r\n\r\nEntering the park from the northeast, you are on a road traversing the\r\npineland-and-hammock “ridge.” This elevated part of the South Florida\r\nlimestone bedrock, which at the park entrance is about 6 feet above sea\r\nlevel, is the driest zone in the park. Pine trees, which will grow only\r\non ground that remains above water most of the year, thrive on this\r\nrockland.\r\n\r\nThere is another condition essential to the survival of the pine forest\r\nin this region—fire. We usually think of fire as the enemy of forest\r\nvegetation; but that is not true here. The pines that grow in this part\r\nof Florida have a natural resistance to fire. Their thick, corky bark\r\ninsulates their trunks from the flames. And strangely enough the fire\r\nactually seems to help with pine reproduction; it destroys competing\r\nvegetation and exposes the mineral soil seedlings need. If there has\r\nbeen a good cone crop, you will find an abundant growth of pine\r\nseedlings after a fire in the pinelands.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen if the pinelands were protected from fire? Examine a\r\npine forest where there have been no recent fires. You will note that\r\nthere are many small hardwood (broadleaved) trees growing in the shade\r\nof the pines. These hardwoods would eventually shade out the\r\nlight-demanding pine seedlings, and take over as the old pines died off.\r\nBut under normal conditions, lightning-caused fires sweep at fairly\r\nfrequent intervals through the pineland. Since the hardwoods have little\r\nresistance to fire, they are pruned back.\r\n\r\nBefore this century, fires burned vast areas. The only barriers were\r\nnatural waterways—sloughs, lakes and ponds, and estuaries—which retained\r\nsome water during the rainless season when the rest of the glades and\r\npinelands dried up. Old-timers say that sometimes a fire would travel\r\nall the way from Lake Okeechobee to the coastal prairie of Cape Sable\r\n(_see_ page 2). In the pine forest, any area bypassed by these fires for\r\na lengthy period developed into a junglelike island of hardwoods. We\r\ncall such stands “hammocks,” whether they develop in the pine forest or\r\nin the open glades. On the limestone ridge, the hammocks support a\r\ncommunity of plants and animals strikingly different from the\r\nsurrounding pine forests.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PINE AND HAMMOCK RIDGE\r\n    (_elevation: 3 to 7 feet above sea level_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SAWGRASS GLADES\r\n  PINELAND\r\n  HARDWOOD HAMMOCK\r\n  PINELAND\r\n    1 SOUTH FLORIDA SLASH PINE\r\n    2 SAW-PALMETTO\r\n    3 COONTIE\r\n    4 SAW-PALMETTO AFTER FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the opening up of south Florida for farming and industry, man’s\r\nworks—particularly roads and canals—soon crisscrossed the region,\r\nforming barriers to the spread of the fires. Suppression of fire by\r\nfarmers, lumbermen, and park managers also lessened their effect. Thus\r\nthe hardwoods, which previously had been held back by fire, tended to\r\nreplace the pines. And although the park was established to preserve a\r\npatch of primitive subtropical America as it was in earlier centuries,\r\nthe landscape began to change.\r\n\r\nContinued protection of the park from fire would in time eliminate the\r\npineland—a plant community that has little chance to survive elsewhere.\r\nSo, in Everglades National Park, Smokey Bear must take a back seat: park\r\nrangers deliberately set fires to help nature maintain the natural\r\nscene. Thus, as you drive down the road to Flamingo, do not be shocked\r\nto discover park rangers burning the vegetation. The fires are\r\ncontrolled, of course, and the existing hammocks are not destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhen you visit the park take a close look at the pinelands community.\r\nNotice, as you walk on the manmade trail through the pine forest, that\r\nthe ground on either side of you is extremely rough. The limestone\r\nbedrock is visible everywhere; what soil there is has accumulated in the\r\npits and potholes that riddle the bedrock. The trees, shrubs, grasses,\r\nand other plants are rooted in these pockets of soil.\r\n\r\nThe limestone looks rather hazardous to walk on—and it is. You must be\r\ncareful not to break through a thin shell of rock covering a cavity.\r\nThis pitted, honeycombed condition is due to the fact that the limestone\r\nis easily dissolved by acids. Decaying pine needles, palmetto leaves,\r\nand other dead plant materials produce weak acids that continually eat\r\naway at the rock.\r\n\r\nIf a fire has passed through the pineland recently, you may notice that\r\nwhile most of the low-growing plants have been killed, some, such as the\r\nsaw-palmetto, are sending up new green shoots. The thick, stubby stem of\r\nthe palmetto lies in a pothole, with its roots in the soil that has\r\naccumulated there; even in the dry season the pocket in the limestone\r\nremains damp, for water is never very far below the surface in this\r\nregion. When fire kills the top of the plant, the stem and roots\r\nsurvive, and the palmetto, like the pine, remains a part of the plant\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nA number of other plants of the south Florida pinelands have adapted to\r\nthe conditions of periodic burning. Coontie (a cycad, from the\r\nunderground stems of which the Indians made flour) and moon vine (a\r\nmorningglory) are among many you will see surviving pineland fires\r\nsevere enough to result in the death or stunting of the hardwood\r\nseedlings and saplings.\r\n\r\nSometimes we forget that fire—like water, wind, and sunlight—is a\r\nnatural force that operates with the others to influence the evolution\r\nof plants as well as to shape the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe pineland, like other plant communities, has its own community of\r\nanimals. Some of its residents, such as the cotton mouse, opossum, and\r\nraccoon, are found in other communities of the park, too.\r\n\r\nSome of the pineland animals, however—pine warbler, reef gecko, and\r\nfive-lined skink, for example—are particularly adapted to this\r\nenvironment. These lovers of sunlight are dependent, like the pine\r\nforest, on the occasional natural or manmade fires that hold back the\r\nhardwood trees.\r\n\r\nThe pine rockland is quite different from the other plant-and-animal\r\ncommunities you will see as you drive through the park: it is the only\r\necosystem you can explore on foot in any season. Other parts of the park\r\nare largely flooded during the wet season. Elevated boardwalks have been\r\nprovided in some of these areas to enable you to penetrate them a short\r\ndistance from the road.\r\n\r\nAs you will see, fire plays an important role in some of the other\r\nEverglades communities, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Tree-island Glades\r\n               (_elevation: 1 to 3 feet above sea level_)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Tree-island Glade]\r\n\r\n\r\n  BAYHEAD\r\n  WILLOW HEAD\r\n  SAWGRASS\r\n  PINE\r\n  DWARF CYPRESS FOREST\r\n  ALLIGATOR HOLE\r\n  CYPRESS HEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PIG FROG\r\n    one-third life size]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GREEN TREEFROG\r\n    one-third life size]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SQUIRREL TREEFROG\r\n    color variation]\r\n\r\nBeyond the pinelands the road, having descended some 2 feet from the\r\npark entrance, brings you into the true everglades—the river of grass,\r\nor, as the Seminoles call it, Pa-Hay-Okee (grassy waters). To the eye,\r\nthe glades look like a very flat, grassy prairie broken by scattered\r\nclumps of trees. During the dry season (winter) it is in fact a\r\nprairie—and sometimes burns fiercely. The dominant everglades plant is\r\nsawgrass (actually not a grass but a sedge). The tree islands develop in\r\nboth high and low spots of the glades terrain. In this unbelievably flat\r\ncountry, small differences in elevation—measured in inches rather than\r\nfeet—cause major differences in the plantlife: tropical hardwoods on the\r\n“mesas,” and swamp trees in the potholes.\r\n\r\nA spot in the glades where the limestone base is elevated just 2 feet\r\nwill be occupied by a small forest of tropical hardwoods and palms—a\r\n“hammock” much like those of the pinelands. A low spot—just a few inches\r\nbelow the general level of the limestone base—will remain wet even in\r\nthe relatively rainless winter when the sawgrass becomes tinder dry.\r\nThis sloughlike depression will support a stand of baldcypress, called a\r\n“cypress head.” Other tree islands, called bayheads and willow heads,\r\ndevelop in many places where soil and peat accumulate.\r\n\r\nStep from the sawgrass glades into one of these hammocks or heads; you\r\nwill find yourself in another world. You cannot know the park until you\r\nhave investigated these plant-and-animal communities so distinct from\r\nthe surrounding marsh yet so much a part of it. As you drive through the\r\npark, look for the trails provided to give you easy access into the\r\ninterior of the tree islands.\r\n\r\nAlso characteristic of the glades are the sloughs—channels where the\r\nglades water, generally a thin, seemingly motionless sheet, is deeper\r\nand has a noticeable current. The sloughs support a rich plantlife and\r\nattract a variety of animals, particularly during the dry season when\r\nthe water level drops below the shallow glades bottom. Animals that live\r\nin the glades when they are under water must migrate or estivate (_see_\r\nglossary) if they are to survive the rainless months. Many migrate to\r\nthe sloughs, the best known of which is Taylor Slough, where the\r\nelevated Anhinga Trail enables you to walk over the water and observe\r\nthe wildlife.\r\n\r\nFire is an important factor in the ecology of the tree-island glades,\r\njust as it is in the pineland. Here, too, artificial barriers such as\r\ncanals and roads have hindered the spread of natural fires. There is\r\nsome evidence that tree islands were scattered more thinly over the\r\nsawgrass prairie a half-century ago, when a single fire might wipe out\r\nscores of them and destroy much of the bed of peat that provided a\r\nfoothold for them. A bird’s-eye view of the glades region today shows\r\nmany tree islands that have been established in recent decades. But park\r\nrangers are now utilizing controlled fires in the glades as well as in\r\nthe pineland. This tends to prevent new tree islands from taking hold,\r\nand thus helps maintain the natural everglades landscape.\r\n\r\nDriving over the glades toward Florida Bay, you come to a sign reading\r\n“Rock Reef Pass—Elevation 3 Feet.” The road then traverses the so-called\r\ndwarf cypress forest. The forest is an open area of scattered, stunted\r\nbaldcypress growing where marl (which, unlike peat, does not burn) has\r\naccumulated in small potholes dissolved in the limestone. These marl\r\npotholes provide a foothold for the dwarf cypresses in an area that is\r\nspotted with cypress heads containing much larger trees. Many of the\r\ndwarf cypresses are more than 100 years old, while tall cypresses in the\r\nheads may be less than 50 years old. These anomalies can be attributed\r\nto varying soil depths and water levels and to the effects of fire.\r\n\r\nBefore you reach the limit of the fresh-water marsh you will come to a\r\nside road leading to Mahogany Hammock. (A good foot trail makes it easy\r\nto explore this hardwood jungle island.) Just beyond, you will notice\r\nthe first red mangroves. Small and scattered in this zone, they are a\r\nsignal that you are approaching a strikingly different plant-and-animal\r\ncommunity, the mangrove swamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Mangrove Swamp\r\n           (_elevation: sea level to 1 foot above sea level_)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PRAIRIE SEDGES]\r\n\r\n\r\n  BAY\r\n  JAMAICA DOGWOOD\r\n  GUMBO-LIMBO\r\n  MAHOGANY\r\n  PRAIRIE SEDGES\r\n  BUTTONWOOD\r\n  WHITE-MANGROVE\r\n  OSPREY NEST\r\n  BLACK-MANGROVE\r\n  RED-MANGROVE (very dense growth)\r\n  ESTUARY\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BONEFISH Comes in with the tide to feed on crabs and\r\n    mollusks in shallow water]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FLORIDA HORN SHELL Lives in shallow water and feeds\r\n    upon algae and other aquatic plants]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ’COON OYSTER A small (1½″) oyster that lives attached\r\n    to the roots of mangroves]\r\n\r\nThe southward-creeping waters of the glades eventually meet and mingle\r\nwith the salty waters of the tidal estuaries. In this transition zone\r\nand along the gulf and Florida Bay coasts a group of trees that are\r\ntolerant of salty conditions, called “mangroves,” form a vast, watery\r\nwilderness. Impenetrable except by boat, it occupies hundreds of square\r\nmiles, embracing both the shifting zone of brackish water and the\r\nsaltier coastal waters.\r\n\r\nSeveral kinds of trees are loosely called “mangroves.” The\r\nwater-tolerant red mangrove grows well out into the mudflats and is\r\neasily recognized by its arching stiltlike roots. Black-mangrove\r\ntypically grows at levels covered by high tide but exposed at low tide,\r\nand it is characterized by the root projections called pneumatophores\r\nthat stick up out of the mud like so many stalks of asparagus growing in\r\nthe shade of the tree. White-mangrove has no peculiar root structure and\r\ngrows, generally, farther from the water, behind the other trees.\r\nSometimes all three are found in mixed stands.\r\n\r\nThis mangrove wilderness, laced by thousands of miles of estuarine\r\nchannels (called “rivers” and “creeks”) and broken by numerous bays and\r\nsounds, is extremely productive biologically. The brackish zone is\r\nparticularly valuable as a nursery ground for shrimp. The larvae and\r\nyoung of these marine crustaceans and of other marine animals remain in\r\nthis relatively protected environment until they are large enough to\r\nventure into the open waters beyond the mangroves.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE MANGROVE SWAMP AND THE COASTAL PRAIRIE]\r\n\r\nThe shrimp represent a multi-million-dollar industry, and the\r\nsports-fishing business of the area is said to exceed that by far. Both\r\nwould suffer if any damage occurred to this ecosystem. The greatest\r\ndanger is the alteration in the flow of fresh waters from the glades and\r\ncypress swamps that occurs when new canals are built and land is drained\r\nfor cultivation or development. The flow carries with it into the\r\nestuaries organic materials from the rich glades ecosystem; these\r\nsupplement the vast quantities of organic matter derived from the decay\r\nof red mangrove leaves. Thus, a reduction in the amount of\r\nnutrient-laden fresh water flowing into the mangrove region will affect\r\nthe welfare of the ecosystem, and indirectly the livelihood or\r\nrecreation of many persons.\r\n\r\nThe productive zone of brackish water varies in breadth according to the\r\nflow of fresh water. In the wet summer it moves seaward as the flow of\r\nfresh water from the glades pushes the tides back. In the drier winter\r\nthe bay and gulf waters move inland and the brackish zone is quite\r\nnarrow. The drainage and canal-building operations in south Florida can\r\nbe extremely disruptive here, since too little, or too much, fresh water\r\nflowing into the estuaries can interfere with their productivity.\r\n\r\nNatural disasters such as hurricanes can also bring about great changes\r\nin the mangrove ecosystem. Yet biologists do not necessarily view the\r\ndestruction of mangroves by hurricanes as catastrophic. The hurricanes\r\nhave been occurring as long as the mangroves have grown here and are\r\npart of the complex of natural forces making the region what it is.\r\n\r\nFire does not seem to be a problem in the mangrove wilderness. The trees\r\nthemselves are not especially fire-resistant, but it is not uncommon to\r\nsee a glades fire burn to the edge of the mangroves and stop when it\r\nruns out of fine fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mangrove wilderness is a mecca for many park visitors. Sportsmen\r\ntake their motorboats into the bays and rivers to challenge the fighting\r\ntarpon. Bird lovers seek the roosts and rookeries of herons and wood\r\nstorks. Canoeists, the only ones able to explore the secret depths, are\r\ndrawn by the spell of labyrinthine channels under arching mangrove\r\nbranches. Here, in a wilderness still thwarting man’s efforts at\r\ndestruction, one experiences a feeling of utter isolation from the\r\nmachine world.\r\n\r\nBut the relentlessly rising sea of the past 10,000 years has belittled\r\ndrought, fire, hurricane, and frost as it slowly inundated this land 3\r\ninches each hundred years. In compensation, the mangrove forest adds\r\npeat and rises with the sea. The sawgrass marshes retreat, and the\r\nmangrove ecosystem prevails essentially unchanged.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: APPLE MUREX\r\n    A carnivorous mollusk that feeds on oysters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Florida Bay and the Coastal Prairie\r\n\r\nWhen you reach Flamingo, a former fishing village and now a center for\r\nvisitor services and accommodations, you will be on the shore of Florida\r\nBay. Here is an environment rich in variety of animal life, where\r\nporpoises play, the American crocodile makes its last stand, and the\r\ngreat white heron, once feared doomed to extinction, holds its own. The\r\nabundance of game fish in the bay has given it a reputation as one of\r\nthe best sport-fishing grounds on the east coast.\r\n\r\nThe bay’s approximately 100 keys (low-lying islets) were built up by\r\nmangroves and provide foothold for other plants hardy enough to\r\nwithstand the salty environment and the sometimes violent winds. The\r\nkeys are also a breeding ground for water birds, ospreys, and bald\r\neagles.\r\n\r\nFlorida Bay, larger than some of our States, is so shallow that at low\r\ntide some of it is out of water; its greatest depth is about 9 feet. The\r\nshallows and mudflats attract great numbers of wading birds, which feed\r\nupon the abundant life sheltered in the seaweeds—a plant-and-animal\r\ncommunity nourished by nutrients carried in the waters flowing from the\r\nglades and mangroves.\r\n\r\nTo the west beyond Flamingo is Cape Sable. This near-island includes the\r\nfinest of the park’s beaches and much of the coastal prairie ecosystem.\r\nA fringe of coconut palms along the beach could be the remnants of early\r\nattempts at a plantation on the cape that did not survive the\r\nhurricanes; or it could be the result of the sprouting of coconuts\r\ncarried by currents from Caribbean plantations and washed up on the\r\ncape. For a time, casuarina trees (called “Australian pines”), which\r\nbecame established on Cape Sable after Hurricane Donna, seemed to\r\nthreaten the ecology of the beach. But these invaders were mostly\r\nremoved in 1971, and now appear to be under control.\r\n\r\nExamine the “sand” of this beach. You will discover that it is not\r\nquartz grains—but mostly minute shell fragments. Entire shells of the\r\nwarm-water molluscs that live offshore also wash up on the beach. There\r\nare also artifacts that speak of Indian activity in this area in past\r\ncenturies, curled centers of conch shells from which the pre-Columbian\r\nIndians fashioned tools, and numerous pieces of pottery (potsherds).\r\nBoth shells and potsherds tempt the collector. Shelling—that is, the\r\ncollecting of _dead_ shells, for noncommercial purposes—is permitted.\r\nBut Federal law prohibits the removal of even a fragment of pottery—for\r\nthese are invaluable Indian relics, essential to continuing scientific\r\ninvestigation of the human history of the region.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FLORIDA BAY AND THE COASTAL PRAIRIE\r\n    (_elevation: sea level to 2 feet above sea level_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  FLORIDA BAY\r\n    1 RED-MANGROVE\r\n    2 BLACK-MANGROVE\r\n    3 WHITE-MANGROVE\r\n    4 BUTTONWOOD\r\n    5 CABBAGE PALMETTO\r\n    6 HURRICANE-KILLED BLACK-MANGROVES\r\n    7 FIG\r\n    8 POISONWOOD\r\n    CROCODILE\r\n    GREAT WHITE HERON\r\n    REDDIS EGRET\r\n    COCONUT PALM\r\n    SUCCULENTS\r\n    GRASSES\r\n    SEDGES\r\n  WATERWAY\r\n  MARL PRAIRIE\r\n\r\n\r\nBack from the narrow beach is a drier zone of grasses and other\r\nlow-growing vegetation. Some of the plants of this zone, such as the\r\nrailroad vine, are so salt-tolerant that in places they grow almost to\r\nthe water’s edge. (No plant that is extremely sensitive to salty soil\r\ncould survive on Cape Sable.) Beyond the grassy zone is a zone of\r\nhardwoods (buttonwood, gumbo-limbo, Jamaica dogwood), cactuses, yucca,\r\nand other plants forming a transition from beach to coastal prairie.\r\n\r\nBirds provide much of the visual excitement of the beach community, just\r\nas they do in other parts of the park. Sandpipers, pelicans, gulls,\r\negrets, ospreys, and bald eagles use it and the bordering waters for\r\nfeeding, nesting, and resting. Mammals, notably raccoons, stalk the\r\nbeach in search of food. And the big loggerhead turtle depends on it for\r\nnesting. In late spring and early summer the female loggerhead hauls\r\nherself up on the beach and digs a hole above hightide mark. There she\r\ndeposits about 100 ping-pong balls—which should hatch out into baby\r\nloggerheads. Unfortunately for this marine reptile, however, most of\r\nthem meet another fate. Hardly has the female turtle covered the eggs\r\nwith sand and started back toward the water, than they are dug up and\r\ndevoured by raccoons and other predators. These conditions created such\r\nhigh mortality of the turtles that the National Park Service has adopted\r\nspecial protective measures—removing some of the raccoons and erecting\r\nwire barriers around turtle nests. These measures have been effective,\r\nbut continued surveillance is required if the loggerhead is not to\r\ndisappear from Florida.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE FLAMINGO AREA]\r\n\r\nAn abundance of raccoons and other predators is not the only threat to\r\nsurvival of the loggerhead turtle. A major factor in its decline is the\r\nserious depletion of its nesting habitat. Park visitors are prohibited\r\nfrom interfering with these reptiles. Cape Sable beach is today\r\nvirtually the only wild beach in South Florida, thanks to its inclusion\r\nin Everglades National Park. At present, visitors can reach it only by\r\nboat. But it would be foolhardy to take it for granted that the beach\r\nwill remain unspoiled. Its potential as an attraction is such that\r\nsomeone not ecologically aware might believe that access for motorists\r\nwould be an improvement. Roads, however, would bring increased pressure\r\non the ecosystem by large numbers of visitors, and demands for further\r\ndevelopment, for lodging, meals, and other services seem always to go\r\nwith automobiles. With continued protection from such encroachments,\r\nCape Sable Beach will remain a unique wilderness resource and will not\r\nbecome just another recreational facility.\r\n\r\nMerging with the beach is the coastal prairie, an ecosystem supporting\r\nred and black mangroves, grasses, and other plants tolerant of the very\r\nsalty environment. Hardwood hammocks have developed here on Indian shell\r\nmounds, but the trees are stunted by the saline soils. Though there is\r\nno lack of water on the cape, much of the region appears arid because\r\nhurricane-lashed tides have deposited soils of marl and debris so\r\nsalt-laden that only sparse vegetation develops.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Big Cypress Swamp\r\n\r\nTo the west of the great fresh-water marsh called the everglades, lying\r\nalmost entirely outside the park, is an ecosystem vitally linked to the\r\npark. Big Cypress Swamp is a vast, shallow basin that includes\r\npractically all of Collier County. It is commonly called “The Big\r\nCypress”—not because of the size of its trees, but because of its\r\nextent. Most of the baldcypresses (which are not true cypresses) are\r\nsmall trees, growing in open to dense stands throughout the area. The\r\nswamp is watered by about 50 inches of annual rainfall, the runoff from\r\nwhich flows as a sheet and in sloughs south and west to meet the coastal\r\nstrip of mangroves and low sand dunes.\r\n\r\nBig Cypress is speckled with low limestone outcrops, cut with shallow\r\nsloughs 1 to 2 feet deep, and dotted with ponds and wet prairies. As in\r\nthe everglades, fire and water maintain the character of the plantlife\r\nin this swampy realm of sunlight and shadow. Also as in the everglades,\r\na difference of a few inches in elevation creates different communities.\r\nTropical hardwood hammocks grow on rocky outcrops. In the depressions\r\narise bayheads and clumps of pond apple, pop ash, and willow. The larger\r\nbaldcypress trees grow in shallow sloughs, which are usually surrounded\r\nby prairies of sawgrass and maiden cane growing on slightly higher land.\r\nAlthough the several different plant communities resemble those in the\r\nglades, they support slightly different plants, because of the sandy\r\nsoil (there being more quartz in the limestone under Big Cypress than in\r\nthe park).\r\n\r\nThese baldcypresses, many measuring 3 to 6 feet in diameter, were\r\nheavily lumbered from 1930 to 1950. Today, few giant trees survive, but\r\na sizable stand exists on the Norris Tract—so named for its\r\nconservation-minded donor—which forms the nucleus of Corkscrew Swamp\r\nSanctuary. Here, protected by the National Audubon Society, are\r\nbaldcypresses 130 feet tall; some have a girth of 25 feet! A boardwalk\r\nmore than one-half mile long enables you to enjoy the beauty of this\r\nwild preserve without getting your feet wet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CYPRESS STRAND]\r\n\r\n\r\n  WET PRAIRIE\r\n  TROPICAL HARDWOOD HAMMOCK\r\n  WET PRAIRIE\r\n    1 SOUTH FLORIDA SLASH PINE\r\n    2 BALDCYPRESS\r\n    3 POP ASH\r\n    4 ROYAL PALM\r\n    AIR PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge stands of baldcypress, called “strands,” support small communities\r\nsuch as ponds, prairies, and tropical hammocks. One such hammock is\r\nfamous for the finest stand of royal palms remaining in south Florida.\r\nThe largest cypress strand—the Fakahatchee—extends some 23 miles north\r\nand south a few miles east of Naples.\r\n\r\nBig Cypress Swamp is the home of wild turkey, bobcat, deer, and an\r\noccasional Florida panther. The fish-eating otter plays in its\r\nwaterways. Most of the birds found in the everglades also are found in\r\nthe trees and waterways of Big Cypress, because the swamp has an\r\nabundance of food. The area is so rich in wildlife and edible plants\r\nthat the Seminole Indians formerly lived entirely off its products.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BOBCAT    WHITE-TAILED DEER    OTTER]\r\n\r\nThe eastern edge of the big swamp and its importance to Everglades\r\nNational Park came to worldwide attention in 1969 when it was selected\r\nas the site for the proposed Miami International Jetport. According to\r\nplans, this was to be the biggest airport in the world, covering 39\r\nsquare miles and handling 65 million passengers a year. Millions of\r\npersons were expected to make their home in and around the jetport. Such\r\na threat to the national park, into which the waters of Big Cypress\r\npartly drain, provoked protest letters from all over the world. Most\r\nwriters objected on the grounds that Everglades belongs to all and that\r\na jetport here would seal the doom of the park. Congress acted in 1974\r\nby establishing Big Cypress National Preserve to help protect the water\r\nsupply to Everglades National Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PLANT-AND-ANIMAL COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTo know Everglades, you must become acquainted with some of its diverse\r\ncommunities. The physical conditions determining the existence of a\r\nparticular community may seem subtle—just a few inches difference in\r\nelevation, or an accumulation of peat in a depression in the limestone\r\nbedrock, for example. But often, the change in your surroundings as you\r\nstep from one community to another is startling—for it is abrupt and\r\ncomplete. In Everglades, the dividing line between two habitats may\r\nseparate an almost entirely different association of plants and animals.\r\n\r\nUse the trails that have been laid out to help you see the communities.\r\nThey make access easy for you; the rest is up to you. Be observant:\r\nnotice the stemlike root of a saw-palmetto in a damp pothole of the\r\npineland; look closely at the periphyton that plays such an important\r\nrole in the glades food chain. Note the difference in feeding methods of\r\nwading birds; each species has its own niche in the habitat. Most of\r\nall, get into the habit of thinking of each animal, each plant, as a\r\nmember of the closely woven web of life that makes up an integrated\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Tropical Hardwood Hammock\r\n\r\nGenerally, in south Florida, hardwood hammocks develop only in areas\r\nprotected from fire, flood, and saline waters. The land must be high\r\nenough (1 to 3 feet above surrounding levels) to stand above the water\r\nthat covers the glades much of the year. The roots of the trees must be\r\nout of the water and must have adequate aeration. In the park, these\r\nconditions prevail on the limestone “ridge” (elevation of which ranges\r\nfrom 3 to 7 feet above sea level) and some spots in the glades region.\r\nOn the limestone ridge, in areas bypassed by fires for a long period,\r\nhammocks have developed. Pines grow in the surrounding areas, where\r\nrepeated fires have held back the hardwoods.\r\n\r\nThe moats that tend to form around glades hammocks, as acids from\r\ndecaying plant materials dissolve the limestone, hold water even during\r\nthe dry season; the moats thus act as barriers protecting the hammock\r\nvegetation from glades fires.\r\n\r\nWhen the white man took over southern Florida, these hammocks were\r\nluxuriant jungle islands dominated by towering tropical hardwoods and\r\npalms. Stumps and logs on the floors of some of the remaining hammocks,\r\nattesting to the enormous size of some of the earlier trees, are sad\r\nreminders of the former grandeur of the hammocks. While most of south\r\nFlorida’s hammocks have been destroyed, you can still see some fine ones\r\nprotected in the park. At Royal Palm Hammock, near park headquarters,\r\nGumbo Limbo Trail winds through a dim, dense forest with welcome\r\ncoolness on a hot day.\r\n\r\nStepping into a jungle hammock from either the sunbathed glades or the\r\nopen pine forest is a sudden, dramatic change. The contrast when you\r\nenter Gumbo Limbo Trail immediately after walking the Anhinga Trail is\r\nstriking. While the watery world of Anhinga is dominated by a noisy\r\nprofusion of wildlife, the environment of Gumbo Limbo will seem to be a\r\nmere tangle of vegetation. But the jungle hammock, too, has its\r\ncommunity of animals—even though you may notice none but mosquitoes.\r\nMany of its denizens are nocturnal in their habits, but if you remain\r\nalert you will observe birds, invertebrates, and perhaps a lizard.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TREE SNAILS\r\n    There are 52 color forms of _Liguus fasciatus_ found in south\r\n    Florida.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Liguus fasciatus pseudopictus_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Liguus fasciatus pictus_]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Liguus fasciatus ornatus_]\r\n\r\nThe trees that envelop you as you walk on Gumbo Limbo Trail are mostly\r\ntropical species; of the dominant trees, only the live oak (which grows\r\nas far north as Virginia) can be considered non-tropical. Under oaks and\r\ntropical bustics, poisonwood, mastics, and gumbo-limbos grow small trees\r\nsuch as tetrazygia, rough-leaf velvetseed, and wild coffee, a multitude\r\nof mosses and ferns, and only a few species of shade-tolerant flowering\r\nplants. Orchids and air plants burst like sun stars from limbs, trunks,\r\nand fallen logs. Twining among them all, the woody vines called lianas\r\nenhance the jungle atmosphere. Adding a final touch are the royal palms\r\nthat here and there tower over the hardwood canopy—occasionally reaching\r\n125 feet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TROPICAL HARDWOOD HAMMOCK]\r\n\r\n\r\n  PINELAND\r\n    SOUTH FLORIDA SLASH PINE\r\n    BUSTIC\r\n    GUMBO-LIMBO\r\n  SOLUTION HOLE\r\n    POND APPLE\r\n    AIR PLANTS (ORCHIDS, BROMELIADS)\r\n    ROYAL PALM\r\n    LIVE OAK\r\n    MASTIC\r\n    VINES\r\n  PINELAND\r\n    SAW-PALMETTO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe limestone rock that underlies the entire park is porous and soluble;\r\nconsequently the floor of the hammock is pitted with solution holes\r\ndissolved by the acid from decaying vegetation. Soil and peat\r\naccumulating in the water-filled bottom of one of these holes supports a\r\nplant community of its own: perhaps a pond apple, surrounded by ferns\r\nand mosses (including some varieties that seem to be limited to this\r\npothole environment).\r\n\r\nA dead, decaying log on the ground may support another miniature plant\r\ncommunity—a carpet of mosses, ferns, and other small plants that thrive\r\nin such moist situations.\r\n\r\nStrangest of the hammock plants is the strangler fig, which first gets a\r\nfoothold in the rough bark of a live oak, cabbage palm, or other tree.\r\nIt then sends roots down to the ground, entwining about the host tree as\r\nit grows, and eventually killing it. On the Gumbo Limbo Trail you will\r\nsee a strangler fig that grew in this manner and was enmeshed by another\r\nstrangler fig—which now is threatened by a third fig that already has\r\ngained a foothold in its branches.\r\n\r\nBest known of the glades hammocks is Mahogany Hammock. A boardwalk trail\r\nin this lush, junglelike tree island leads past the giant mahogany tree\r\nfor which the hammock was named—now, because of Hurricane Donna, a\r\ndismembered giant. This fine tree island was explored only after the\r\npark was established.\r\n\r\nAn array of large and small vertebrate animals, mostly representative of\r\nthe Temperate Zone, populates these tropical hardwood jungles: raccoons\r\nand opossums, many varieties of birds, snakes and lizards, tree frogs,\r\neven bobcats and the rare Florida panther, or cougar. Not surprisingly,\r\ninvertebrates—including insects and snails—abound in this luxuriant\r\nplant community. The tropical influence is evident in the presence of\r\ninvertebrates such as tree snails of the genus _Liguus_, known outside\r\nof Florida only in Hispaniola and Cuba.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Cypress Head\r\n\r\nStanding out conspicuously on the glades landscape are tall, domelike\r\ntree islands of baldcypress. Unlike hammocks, which occupy elevations,\r\ncypress heads, or domes, occupy depressions in the limestone\r\nbedrock—areas that remain as ponds or wet places during seasons when the\r\nglades dry up. Water-loving cypresses need only a thin accumulation of\r\npeat and soil to begin their growth in these depressions or in smaller\r\nsolution holes in the limestone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cypress head]\r\n\r\n\r\n  BALDCYPRESS\r\n  ALLIGATOR HOLE (often in middle of cypress head)\r\n  SAWGRASS\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TURKEY VULTURE]\r\n\r\nThough most conifers retain their needles all year, baldcypresses shed\r\ntheir foliage in winter. The fallen needles decay, forming acids that\r\ndissolve the limestone further; thus these trees tend to enlarge their\r\nown ponds. Since the pond is deeper in the middle, and the accumulation\r\nof peat is greater there, the taller trees grow in the center of the\r\nhead, with the smaller ones toward the edge. Hence the characteristic\r\ndome-shaped profile.\r\n\r\nUsually when fire sweeps the glades, the baldcypresses, occupying low,\r\nwet spots, are not injured. But with extended drought, the water\r\ndisappears and the peat may burn for months, killing all the\r\nbaldcypresses.\r\n\r\nThe cypress heads sometimes serve as alligator holes, where the big\r\nreptiles and other aquatic animals are able to survive dry periods. As\r\nyou drive along the park road, stop and examine these tree islands\r\nthrough your binoculars; they are favored haunts of many of the park’s\r\nlarger wading birds. Look for herons, egrets, wood storks, and white\r\nibis, which visit these swampy habitats to feed on the abundant aquatic\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBald eagles find the tops of the tallest cypresses advantageous perches\r\nfrom which to scan the marsh. And at night certain of the cypress heads\r\nare “buzzard roosts”—resting areas for gatherings of hundreds of turkey\r\nvultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Bayhead\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Bayhead]\r\n\r\n\r\n  ALLIGATOR FLAG\r\n  COCOPLUM\r\n  SWAMP HOLLY\r\n  CABBAGE PALMETTO\r\n  REDBAY\r\n  SWEETBAY\r\n  SAWGRASS\r\n  WILLOW\r\n  ORCHIDS AND BROMELIADS\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the tree islands in the fresh-water glades are of the type\r\ncalled bayhead. Growing in depressions in the limestone or from beds of\r\npeat built up on the bedrock, these plant communities contain a variety\r\nof trees, including swamp holly, redbay, sweetbay, wax myrtle, and\r\ncocoplum. Some of them, on the fringes of the brackish zone, are marked\r\nby clumps of graceful paurotis palms growing at their edges.\r\n\r\nLike the hardwood hammocks in the pinelands, bayheads are prevented from\r\ntaking over the entire glades ecosystem by the dry-season fires that\r\nsweep the region at irregular intervals. The fires do not always affect\r\nthe bayheads. A moat, formed by the dissolving action of acids from\r\ndecaying plant materials on the limestone, may surround the tree island,\r\nproviding some protection from fire. Wildlife concentrates in these\r\nmoats during the dry season. Birds congregate here to harvest the fish,\r\nsnails, and other aquatic life—and occasionally themselves fall prey to\r\nlurking alligators.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Willow Head\r\n\r\nWillows pioneer new territories and create an environment that enables\r\nother plants to gain a foothold. Their windblown seeds usually root in\r\nsunny land opened by fire and agriculture. Since these trees require a\r\ngreat quantity of water, the solution holes in the glades are favorable\r\nsites. Seedlings grow, leaves fall, and stems and twigs die and\r\ndrop—contributing to the formation of peat. When this builds up close to\r\nor above the surface of the water, it provides a habitat for other trees\r\nsuch as sweet bay and cocoplum; with enough of these the willow head\r\nchanges character and becomes a bayhead.\r\n\r\nYears ago, when alligators were plentiful, they weeded the\r\nwillow-bordered solution holes, keeping them open. Consequently, the\r\nwillow heads were typically donut-shaped. Today, however, alligators are\r\nscarce and many of the willow heads have no ’gators. The solution holes\r\nfill with muck and peat; relatively tall willows rise out of the deep,\r\npeat-filled centers, with increasingly smaller ones toward the less\r\nfertile edges, and the willow heads take on the characteristic\r\ndome-shaped profile but not nearly the height of the cypress domes. They\r\nhave a clumpy, brushy appearance, seeming to grow right out of the marsh\r\nwithout trunks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: POMACEA SNAIL—The sole food of the everglade kite]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: EVERGLADE KITE]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Willow heads with alligator holes typically have a\r\n    doughnut shape—the gator hole representing the hole in the\r\n    doughnut.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SPATTERDOCK\r\n  COASTAL PLAIN WILLOW\r\n  CATTAIL\r\n  DRY SEASON WATER LEVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nWillow heads that do have alligator holes have a seasonal concentration\r\nof aquatic animals and the birds and mammals that prey upon them. They\r\nrarely support orchids or bromeliads, for the bark of the southern\r\nwillow is too smooth to provide anchorage for the seedlings of these\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nDuring drought periods willow heads, like bayheads, are vulnerable to\r\nthe fires that sometimes burn over the glades.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Web of Life in the Marsh\r\n\r\nAround the stems and other underwater parts of the glades plants are\r\ncylindrical masses of yellowish-green _periphyton_. So incredibly\r\nabundant are these masses of living material that in late summer the\r\nwater appears as though clogged with mossy-looking sausages and floating\r\npancakes. Largely algae, but containing perhaps 100 different organisms,\r\nthe periphyton supports a complex web of glades life. It is the\r\nbeginning of many food chains in the fresh-water marsh. The larvae of\r\nmosquitoes and other invertebrates, larval frogs (tadpoles) and\r\nsalamanders, and other small, free-swimming creatures feed upon the tiny\r\nplants and minute animals living in the masses of periphyton. These\r\nperiphyton feeders are in turn fed upon by small fish, frogs, and other\r\nvertebrates, which are food for big fish, birds, mammals, and reptiles;\r\nmost of these larger creatures are preyed upon by the alligator.\r\n\r\nThe periphyton is perhaps most important for its role in maintaining the\r\nphysical environment of the marsh. The water flowing over the limestone\r\nof the glades is hard with calcium. The algae remove this calcium and\r\nconvert it to marl (_see_ glossary), which precipitates to the bottom.\r\nSawgrass is rooted in this marl; accumulated dead sawgrass forms peat;\r\nother marsh plants, including willows and the trees of the bayheads,\r\nspring up from the peat. Acid from the peat and from decaying plant\r\nmatter of the tree islands dissolves some of the marl and underlying\r\nbedrock—and the cycle is complete.\r\n\r\nEvery plant, every animal, every physical element is involved in this\r\nweb of life—as soil builder, predator, plant-eater, scavenger, agent of\r\ndecay, or converter of energy and raw materials into food. Damage to or\r\nremoval of any of these components—pollution of the water, lowering of\r\nthe water table, elimination of a predator, or any interference in the\r\nenergy cycle—could destroy the glades as we know them.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BEGINNING OF FOOD CHAIN]\r\n\r\n\r\n  ALGAE AND ONE-CELLED ANIMALS\r\n  INVERTEBRATE LARVAE\r\n  PERIPHYTON MASS\r\n  SAWGRASS\r\n  SAWGRASS DIES AND MAKES PEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery other plant-and-animal community in the park—hammock, mangrove\r\nswamp, pineland, etc.—is an association of large and small organisms\r\nsharing a physical environment. It is impossible to understand either\r\nthe park as a whole or the life of a single creature without being aware\r\nof these interrelationships.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Alligator Hole in the Glades\r\n\r\nOut in the sunny glades the broad leaves of the alligator flag mark the\r\nlocation of an alligator hole. This is the most incredible ecosystem of\r\nall the worlds within the world of the park; for in a sense the\r\nalligator is the keeper of the everglades.\r\n\r\nWith feet and snout these reptiles clear out the vegetation and muck\r\nfrom the larger holes in the limestone. In the dry season, when the\r\nfloor of the glades checks in the sun, these holes are oases. Then large\r\nnumbers of fish, turtles, snails, and other fresh-water animals take\r\nrefuge in the holes, moving right in with the alligators. Enough of\r\nthese water-dependent creatures thus survive the drought to repopulate\r\nthe glades when the rains return. Birds and mammals join the migration\r\nof the everglades animal kingdom to the alligator holes, feed upon the\r\nconcentrated life in them—and in turn occasionally become food for their\r\nalligator hosts.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ALLIGATOR FLAG]\r\n\r\nLily pads float on the surface. Around the edges arrowleaf, cattails,\r\nand other emergent plants grow. Behind them on higher muckland, much of\r\nwhich is created by the alligators as they pile up plant debris, stand\r\nferns, wildflowers, and swamp trees. Algae thrive in the water. The\r\nrooted water plants might become so dense as to hinder the movement and\r\ngrowth of the fish, were it not for the weeding activities of the\r\nalligators. With the old reptiles keeping the pool open, the fish\r\nthrive, and alligator and guests live well.\r\n\r\nPlants piled beside the hole by the alligator decay and form soil with\r\nmud and marl. Ferns, wildflowers, and tree seedlings take root, and\r\neventually the alligator hole may be the center of a tree island.\r\n\r\nSo, it’s easy to see how important the alligator is to the ecology of\r\nthe park. Unfortunately for this reptile, many people in the past\r\nbelieved only in the value of its hide. Hunting for alligators became\r\nprofitable in the mid-1880’s and continued until the 1960’s. In 1961\r\nFlorida prohibited all hunting of alligators, but poaching continued to\r\ntake its toll. Finally, the Federal Endangered Species Act of 1969\r\nprotected the alligator by eliminating all hunting and trafficking in\r\nhides.\r\n\r\nAs a result of complete protection, the alligator has increased greatly\r\nin number. They are no longer an endangered species in Florida, and they\r\ncan easily be found in gator holes and sloughs. Today alligators are\r\neagerly sought by visitors to Everglades National Park who are anxious\r\nto see and photograph this unique creature. Once again, the alligator is\r\nthe keeper of the everglades.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ACTUAL SIZE AT HATCHING (8″ to 10″)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Alligator]\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOOD\r\n    FISH (gar, bass, etc.)\r\n    BIRDS\r\n    TURTLES (soft-shelled and others)\r\n    MAMMALS\r\n    RACCOON\r\n    SNAPPING TURTLE\r\n    GREEN HERON\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 40 TO 60 EGGS LAID IN NEST OF HUMUS IN MAY OR JUNE]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MOTHER TENDS YOUNG 1 TO 2 YEARS\r\n    1 YEAR OLD: ABOUT 2′ LONG]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ALLIGATOR HOLE IN THE GLADES]\r\n\r\n\r\n  SNOWY EGRET\r\n  WHITE IBIS\r\n  WOOD STORK\r\n  MOSQUITO (15 species)\r\n  SNAIL EGGS\r\n  PIG FROG\r\n  ALLIGATOR NEST\r\n  DRY SEASON WATER LEVEL\r\n  GAMBUSIA\r\n  KILLIFISH\r\n  SUNFISH\r\n  LARGEMOUTHED BASS\r\n  FLORIDA SPOTTED GAR\r\n  FLORIDA SOFT-SHELLED TURTLE\r\n  1 SPIKE RUSH\r\n  2 PINK GERARDIA\r\n  3 SPIDER LILY\r\n  4 CATTAIL\r\n  5 PICKEREL WEED\r\n  6 ARROWHEAD\r\n  7 WATER LILY\r\n  8 SPATTERDOCK\r\n  9 BLADDERWORT\r\n  10 ALLIGATOR FLAG\r\n  11 MORNINGGLORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DISCOVERING EVERGLADES PLANTS AND ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nEverglades National Park, with its array of plant communities—ranging\r\nfrom the pines and palmettos rooted in the pitted limestone bedrock of\r\nthe park’s dry uplands, through the periphyton-based marsh community and\r\nthe brackish mangrove swamp, to the highly saline waters of Florida\r\nBay—is an amateur botanist’s paradise. Many of the park’s plants are\r\nfound nowhere else in the United States. Only here at the southern tip\r\nof the Florida peninsula do tropical trees and orchids mingle with oaks\r\nand pines.\r\n\r\nThis book is not intended to be a manual for identification of the\r\nEverglades plants. You will need to arm yourself with appropriate field\r\nguides to ferns, orchids, aquatic plants, trees, or whatever your\r\nspecial interest may be. The reading list in the appendix suggests a\r\nfew.\r\n\r\nWhile the park is a mecca for students of plantlife, you must keep one\r\nthing in mind: your collecting will be limited to photographs (and, if\r\nyou’re an artist, drawings). _No specimens may be removed or disturbed._\r\nFortunately, with today’s versatile cameras and high-quality color films\r\nyou can take home a complete and accurate record of your plant\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nMuch of our present knowledge of Everglades plantlife has been garnered\r\nby amateurs. Much more needs to be accumulated before an environmental\r\nmanagement program for the park can be perfected, and serious students\r\nof botany are invited to make their data available to the park staff.\r\n\r\nAs for wild animals, one hardly needs to look for them in this park!\r\nMost visitors come here, at least partly, for that reason. And even\r\nthose not seeking wildlife should be alert to avoid stepping on or\r\nrunning down the slower or less wary creatures. But animal watching is a\r\ngreat pastime, and it pays to learn to do it right. A few suggestions\r\nmay help you make the most of your experience in Everglades.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BIRDS AND REPTILES]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Big Cypress Swamp\r\n  Mangrove Swamp\r\n  Pine Rockland\r\n  Coastal Prairie\r\n  Everglades\r\n  BIRDS AND REPTILES\r\n    Heron Rookeries\r\n    Brown Pelican Rookeries\r\n    Spoonbill Rookeries\r\n    Wood Stork Rookeries\r\n    Sea Turtle Nesting\r\n    Recent Crocodile Nesting\r\n\r\n\r\nA notebook in which to record your observations will help you discover\r\nthat this park is not just a landscape of grass, water, and trees where\r\na lot of animals happen to live—but a complex, subtropical world of\r\nplant-and-animal communities, each distinct and yet dependent upon the\r\nothers. To gain real understanding of this world you will need certain\r\nskills and some good habits. Ability to identify what you see—with the\r\nhelp of good field guides (_see_ reading list) and quite a bit of\r\npractice—will make things easier and much more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nKnowing where to look for the animals helps; this book and the field\r\nguides are useful for this. You’ll find that some species are seen only\r\nin certain parts of the park, while others roam far and wide. Don’t look\r\nfor the crocodile in the fresh-water glades—nor for the round-tailed\r\nmuskrat in the mangroves. On the other hand, don’t be surprised to see\r\nthe raccoon or its tracks in almost any part of the park.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that all species in the national parks are protected by\r\nlaw. Most wild animals are harmless as long as they are not molested. If\r\nyou encounter an animal you aren’t sure about, simply keep out of its\r\nway; don’t try to harm it or drive it off. Always remember that each\r\nanimal is part of the Everglades community; you cannot disturb it\r\nwithout affecting everything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Air Plants\r\n\r\nLong before you have learned to distinguish the major plant communities,\r\nyou will be aware of the air plants—or epiphytes—that grow so profusely\r\nin Everglades. Epiphytes are non-parasitic plants that grow on other\r\nplants, getting their nourishment from the air. Best known is Spanish\r\nmoss, which festoons the trees of the coastal South from Virginia to\r\nTexas; this plant is used by the swallow-tailed kite in constructing its\r\nbeautiful nest. Despite its name, Spanish moss is actually a member of\r\nthe pineapple family—the bromeliads. Bromeliads are the most conspicuous\r\nof the park’s air plants. The epiphytic orchids, though less common, are\r\ncelebrated for their beauty; their fame, unfortunately, has led to their\r\nwidespread destruction. There are also epiphytic ferns, trees, and\r\nvines; and one cactus, the mistletoe cactus, has taken to the air.\r\n\r\nAir plants are highly specialized for making a living under crowded\r\nconditions; there are more than 2,000 species of plants competing for\r\nsun and water in southern Florida. The epiphytes have adapted to the\r\nproblem of space by growing on other plants. Their roots, although they\r\nabsorb some water and minerals, are primarily anchors. Living in an\r\natmosphere that fluctuates between drought and humidity, they have\r\nevolved several water-conserving tricks. Some have a reduced number of\r\nleaves; others have tough skins that resist loss of water through\r\ntranspiration; still others have thick stems, called pseudobulbs, that\r\nstore moisture. The bromeliads are particularly ingenious: many have\r\nleaves shaped in such a way that they hold rainwater in vaselike\r\nreservoirs at their bases. Mosquitoes and tree frogs breed in these tiny\r\nreservoirs, and in dry periods many arboreal animals seek the dew that\r\ncollects here.\r\n\r\nMost of the orchids and bromeliads grow in the dimly lit tropical\r\nhardwood hammocks and cypress sloughs. A few species, however, having\r\nadapted to the sunlight, live on dwarf mangroves and the scattered\r\nbuttonwoods, pond apples, willows, and cocoplums of the glades. The\r\nbutterfly and cowhorn orchids are sun lovers, as are the twisted,\r\nbanded, and stiff-leaved bromeliads. All have adapted to the sun with\r\ndew-condensing mechanisms or vases at the bottom of the clustered\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COMMON BROMELIADS]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: STIFF-LEAVED WILDPINE]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NEEDLE-LEAVED AIR PLANT]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SMALL CATOPSIS]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: REFLEXED WILDPINE]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TWISTED AIR PLANT]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SOFT-LEAVED WILDPINE]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SPANISH MOSS]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BANDED WILDPINE]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BALL-MOSS]\r\n\r\nOne tree, the strangler fig, starts as an epiphytic seedling on the\r\nbranches of other trees. Eventually, however, it drops long aerial roots\r\ndirectly to the ground or entwines them about the trunk of the host\r\ntree—which in time dies, leaving a large fig tree in its place.\r\n\r\nOf all Everglades plants, the epiphytic orchids are most fascinating to\r\nman—a fact which largely explains their decline. Of some 50,000 species\r\naround the world (the orchids being one of the largest of plant\r\nfamilies), the park has only a few. Fire, loss of habitat due to\r\nagriculture and construction, and poaching by both commercial and\r\namateur collectors have brought about the extermination of some and have\r\nmade others exceedingly rare. Some are rare because of special life\r\nrequirements. For example, a few must live in association with a certain\r\nfungus that coats their roots and provides specific nutrients.\r\n\r\nThe largest orchid in the park is the cowhorn, some specimens of which\r\nweigh as much as 75 pounds. Unfortunately, this orchid has been a\r\npopular item for orchid growers and collectors and is becoming rare in\r\nFlorida. Poachers have practically eliminated it from the park. In the\r\nlate 1960s Boy Scout friends of Everglades salvaged many orchids from\r\nhammocks about to be bulldozed for the jetport. By laboriously tying\r\nthem to trees in the park, they assured the survival of the plants.\r\n\r\nThe night-blooming epidendrum is perhaps the most beautiful of the\r\npark’s orchids. It is widespread and fairly common in Everglades,\r\noccurring in all ecosystems. Flowering throughout the year, it bears its\r\nwhite, spiderlike blossoms, 2 inches across, one at a time. It is\r\nespecially fragrant at night—hence its name.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SHOWY ORCHIDS OF THE HAMMOCKS AND TREE ISLANDS]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BROWN EPIDENDRUM]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DOLLAR ORCHID]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NIGHT BLOOMING EPIDENDRUM]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SPREAD-EAGLE ORCHID]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BUTTERFLY ORCHID]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FLORIDA ONCIDIUM]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MULE-EAR ORCHID]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OBLONG-LEAVED VANILLA]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GHOST ORCHID]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SPIDER ORCHID]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CLAMSHELL ORCHID]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WORM-VINE ORCHID]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COWHORN ORCHID]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TRINIDAD MACRADENIA]\r\n\r\nEpiphytic orchids have the smallest seeds of any flowering plants.\r\nDustlike, they travel far and wide on the air; it is believed that over\r\neons all species of Florida orchids arrived on the wind from South\r\nAmerica and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe giant wildpine is a spectacular bromeliad that grows on the sturdy\r\nlimbs of buttonwoods, spreading to 48 inches and developing a flower\r\nstalk 6 feet long.\r\n\r\nOf the approximately 20 species of epiphytic ferns in the park, the most\r\ncommon is the curious resurrection fern. Sometimes called the poor man’s\r\nbarometer, it has leaves that in dry weather curl under and turn brown\r\nbut with the coming of rain quickly unfold and turn bright green, making\r\ninstant gardens of the logs, limbs, and branches on which they grow.\r\n\r\nWatch for the air plants (as well as the trees and other wildflowers)\r\nthat have been labeled along the trails and boardwalks. You will be able\r\nto examine some of them closely—but leave them unharmed for future\r\nvisitors!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Mammals\r\n\r\nIn the drowned habitats of Everglades it is not surprising to find\r\nwater-bound mammals such as the porpoise; or fish-eating amphibious\r\nmammals such as the otter; or even land mammals, such as the raccoon,\r\nthat characteristically feed upon aquatic life. But to see mammals that\r\none ordinarily does not associate with water behaving as though they\r\nwere born to it is another matter. The white-tailed deer is an example.\r\nIt is so much a part of this watery environment that you will most\r\nlikely observe it far out in the glades, feeding upon aquatic plants or\r\nbounding over the marsh. Very probably the deer you see was born on one\r\nof the tree islands, and has never been out of sight of the sawgrass\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nMany other mammals of Everglades are adapted to a semi-aquatic\r\nexistence. The park’s only representative of the hare-and-rabbit clan is\r\nthe marsh rabbit; smaller than its close relative, the familiar\r\ncottontail of fields and woodlands, it is as comfortable in this wet\r\nworld as if it had webbed feet. So don’t be startled if you see a rabbit\r\nswimming here! The park’s rodents include the marsh rice rat and\r\nround-tailed muskrat, also at home in a watery environment.\r\n\r\nThe playful otter, though it may travel long distances overland, is a\r\nfamous water-lover. Lucky is the visitor who sees a family of these\r\nlarge relatives of the weasel! The otter’s smaller cousin, the\r\neverglades mink, is also a denizen of the marsh and a predator in the\r\nfood web; but you are not likely to see this wary animal.\r\n\r\nRaccoons and opossums, adaptable creatures that they are, live in all\r\nthe park’s environments—except in the air and under water. Their diets\r\nare as wide-ranging as their habitat. The raccoon, though it has a taste\r\nfor aquatic animals such as fish, frogs, and crayfish, also consumes\r\nsmall land vertebrates and various plant foods. The opossum eats\r\nvirtually anything in the animal kingdom that it can find and subdue, as\r\nwell as a wide variety of plant materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SOME IMPORTANT EVERGLADES MAMMALS\r\n\r\n SPECIES           PINE   HARDWOOD GLADES MANGROVE  FRESH- FLORIDA COASTAL REMARKS\r\n                 ROCKLAND  HAMMOCK          SWAMP    WATER BAY and PRAIRIE\r\n                                                    SWAMPS   KEYS\r\n\r\n Opossum            X         X      X        X        X      X       X\r\n Short-tailed                                          X\r\n    Shrew\r\n Least Shrew                                           X\r\n Marsh Rabbit       X         X      X                 X      X       X\r\n Fox Squirrel                                 X        ?\r\n Rice Rat                            X                 X\r\n Cotton Mouse       X         X      X                 X\r\n Hispid Cotton                                                        X\r\n    Rat\r\n Florida Water                       X                 X\r\n    Rat\r\n Raccoon            X         X      X        X        X      X       X    Abundant\r\n Black Bear         ?         ?      ?        ?        ?              ?

This large, beautiful cat is on the\r\nendangered species list. Today many groups and individuals are working\r\nto keep this predator a part of the environment. Their efforts have\r\nresulted in methods to assist panther recovery: lower speed limits and\r\nhighway culverts and bridges, to mention only two. With continued\r\nassistance, the panther may remain a part of the Everglades for years to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nBecause it is much more numerous and much less secretive in its habits,\r\nthe bobcat is more likely to be encountered by park visitors than is the\r\ncougar. Keep your eyes alert for this wild feline—particularly in the\r\nFlamingo area—and you may have a chance to observe it closely and at\r\nsome length (even by daylight!). Such boldness and such unconcern for\r\nhumans are not typical of this species, but seem to be peculiarities of\r\nthe bobcats living in the park. Although bobcats are not known as water\r\nlovers, they are found in all the Everglades environments. Their\r\napparent liking for life in the park may be due to an abundance of food\r\nand to freedom from persecution by man and his dogs. Bobcats in\r\nEverglades, if their food habits elsewhere are any guide, probably live\r\non rodents, marsh rabbits, and birds, with possibly an occasional fawn.\r\n\r\nIn Florida Bay and the estuaries, look for the porpoise, or bottlenosed\r\ndolphin, a small member of the whale order that has endeared itself to\r\nAmericans through its antics at marine aquariums and on television.\r\nWatch for it when you are on a boat trip in the park’s marine\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nMuch less commonly seen, and much less familiar, is the timid and very\r\nrare manatee. It’s probably the “most” animal of the park—the largest\r\n(sometimes over 15 feet long and weighing nearly 1 ton), the shyest, the\r\nstrangest, and the homeliest; and it is probably also the most delicate,\r\nfor a drop in water temperatures may kill it. The estuaries of\r\nEverglades National Park are almost the northern limits of its normal\r\nrange. But manatees are often found well north of the park on both\r\ncoasts in cold weather, when they swim up rivers to seek the\r\nconstant-temperature water discharged by electric power plants. Despite\r\nits size, the manatee is a harmless creature, being a grazer—a sort of\r\nunderwater cow that is exceptionally vulnerable to motorboats because of\r\nits gentle nature and languid movement.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MANATEE]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Birds\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LONG-LEGGED WADING BIRDS OF THE GLADES, FRESH-WATER\r\n    SWAMPS, MANGROVE SWAMPS, AND FLORIDA BAY.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BLACK-CROWNED NIGHT HERON]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LOUISIANA HERON\r\n    GREEN HERON\r\n    YELLOW-CROWNED NIGHT HERON]\r\n\r\nFrom the pelican—whose mouth can hold more than its belly can—to the\r\ntiny hummingbird, the birds of Everglades National Park add beauty,\r\namusement, excitement, and drama to the daily scene. Much more\r\nconspicuous than the park’s other animals, they can be enjoyed with no\r\nspecial effort. But a pair of binoculars and a field guide will make\r\nbird watching a more rewarding pastime for you.\r\n\r\nMany of the park’s birds are large and colorful, and so tolerant of\r\nman’s presence that you can observe them closely without the aid of\r\nbinoculars. The Anhinga Trail and other sites on or near the main park\r\nroad provide ready access to activity by herons and egrets, cormorants,\r\ngallinules, and other species that feed upon the fish, frogs, and lesser\r\nlife of the waters.\r\n\r\nThe anhinga, after whom the park’s most popular trail is named, is a\r\nfavorite with visitors. It is also called water-turkey, probably because\r\nof its large size and long, white-tipped tail feathers. A third name,\r\nsnake bird, derives from the anhinga’s habit of swimming almost totally\r\nsubmerged with its long, snaky neck above the surface. The anhinga is a\r\nskilled fisherman, seeking out its quarry by swimming underwater. It\r\nspears a fish with its beak, surfaces, tosses the fish into the air,\r\ncatches it, and gulps it down head first. During this activity, the\r\nanhinga has gotten soaked to the skin, for, unlike ducks and many other\r\nwater birds, it is not well supplied with oil to keep its plumage dry.\r\nSo, following a plunge, the anhinga struggles to the branch of a shrub\r\nor tree, and, spreading its wings, hangs its feathers out to dry.\r\n\r\nThe snail kite, one of America’s rarest birds, flies low over the\r\nfresh-water marshes, its head pointed downward, searching for its sole\r\nfood—the Pomacea snail. A sharply hooked beak enables it to remove the\r\nsnail from its shell. More striking in appearance is its cousin, the\r\nswallow-tailed kite, aerial acrobat of the hawk family—a migrant that\r\nnests in the park in spring and spends the winter in South America. On\r\nlong, pointed wings this handsome bird eats in the air while holding\r\nitself in one place on the wind. In the mangroves, it hunts in an\r\nunusual way: skimming over the trees, it snatches lizards and other\r\nsmall animals from the topmost branches. Red-shouldered hawks, often\r\nseen perching on the treetops beside the park road, feed upon snakes and\r\nother small animals. The fish-eating osprey is another conspicuous\r\nresident of the park, and its bulky nests will be seen when you take a\r\nboat trip into Florida Bay or the mangrove wilderness. The bald eagle,\r\nwhich, sadly, is no longer common in North America and may soon be\r\nexterminated because of pesticide pollution of its fishing waters, is\r\nstill holding out in the Everglades region, where 50 or so breeding\r\npairs seem to be reproducing successfully.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LITTLE BLUE HERON]\r\n\r\n\r\n  immature\r\n  adult\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GREAT BLUE HERON]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: REDDISH EGRET\r\n    WHITE PHASE]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WOOD STORK\r\n    GLOSSY IBIS\r\n    WHITE IBIS]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: AMERICAN (COMMON) EGRET\r\n    SNOWY EGRET]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LIMPKIN\r\n    AMERICAN BITTERN\r\n    ROSEATE SPOONBILL]\r\n\r\nThe long-legged wading birds of the heron family are so numerous and so\r\nmuch alike in appearance that you will need your bird guide for sure\r\nidentification. The waders are interesting to watch, because of the\r\nvariety of feeding methods. Particularly amusing are the antics of the\r\nreddish egret as it hunts small animals in the shallows of Florida Bay\r\nat low tide. It is much unlike other herons in its manner of hunting: it\r\nlurches through the shallows, dashing to left and right as if drunk, in\r\npursuit of its prey. This clownish survivor of the old plume-hunting\r\ndays exists in Florida in very limited numbers.\r\n\r\nSince about 300 species of birds have been recorded in the park, this\r\nsampling barely suggests the pleasures awaiting you if you plan to spend\r\nsome time playing the Everglades bird-watching game.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Reptiles and Amphibians\r\n\r\nEverglades’ most famous citizen—the alligator—is looked for by all\r\nvisitors to the park, who may, however, be unaware that many other kinds\r\nof reptiles and a dozen species of amphibians dwell here.\r\n\r\nThe American crocodile, less common than the alligator and restricted to\r\nthe Florida Bay region, is a shy and secretive animal seen by few\r\nvisitors. Similar in size and appearance to the alligator, it is\r\ndistinguished by a narrower snout and a lighter color. Its habitat\r\noverlaps that of the alligator, which prefers fresh or brackish water.\r\n\r\nThe turtles of the park include terrestrial, fresh-water, and marine\r\nspecies. Box turtles are often seen along the roads. The softshell and\r\nsnapping turtles live in the fresh-water areas and are often eaten by\r\nalligators. Loggerhead turtles nest on Cape Sable beaches, otherwise\r\nthey rarely come ashore. Their eggs are often discovered and devoured by\r\nthe abundant raccoons. But man has been largely responsible for the\r\nloggerhead’s increasing rarity.\r\n\r\nAlthough the park has about two dozen species of snakes, you may not\r\nencounter any of them. Most are harmless—several species of snakes\r\nfrequent the waterways, and it is a mistake to assume that any water\r\nsnake you see is a moccasin. Two worth watching for are the everglades\r\nrat snake and the indigo snake, both handsome and entirely harmless to\r\nman. The former is a constrictor, feeding mostly on rodents. The indigo\r\nis one of our longest snakes—sometimes reaching more than 100 inches—and\r\nnow in danger of extinction.\r\n\r\nOrdinary caution and alertness when walking on trails is advisable; but\r\nkeep in mind that the snakes are not aggressive, and that as part of the\r\nweb of life in the park they are given protection just as are birds and\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\nOf those close relatives of snakes, the lizards, the Florida anole is\r\nmost commonly seen. This is the little reptile sold at circuses as a\r\n“chameleon”; it is quite unlike the true chameleon of the Old World. The\r\nso-called “glass snake”—which got its name from its defensive maneuver\r\nof dropping off its tail (which is longer than the rest of its body) and\r\nfrom its snakelike appearance—is actually a legless lizard. The lizards,\r\nlike the smaller snakes, are primarily insectivorous.\r\n\r\nThe park’s amphibians, too, are quite inconspicuous. The voices of frogs\r\nand toads during the breeding season, however, are part of the\r\nEverglades atmosphere. You will enjoy the nocturnal serenade at\r\negg-laying time—and it is quite possible to learn to identify species by\r\ntheir songs, which are as distinctive as those of birds.\r\n\r\nThe green treefrog, with its bell-like, repeated “queenk-queenk-queenk”\r\ncall, is abundant, and can be seen and heard easily during the breeding\r\nseason, particularly at Royal Palm Hammock and on the Anhinga Trail.\r\n\r\nThe cold-blooded vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, and reptiles,\r\nplay a significant role in the balance of life in the park, feeding upon\r\neach other and upon lesser animals and in turn being food for larger\r\npredators such as herons, hawks, raccoons, and otters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Fishes\r\n\r\n“Fishing Reserved for the Birds,” says the sign at the beginning of the\r\nAnhinga Trail. Actually, the catching of fish in the fresh waters of the\r\npark is an important activity not only for herons, anhingas, grebes, and\r\nospreys, but also for raccoons, mink, turtles, alligators ... and bigger\r\nfish. Not surprisingly in the drowned habitats of Everglades, even the\r\nsmallest fish are important in the web of life.\r\n\r\nOne tiny species, the gambusia, is of special interest to us. This\r\n2-inch fish is credited with helping keep down the numbers of mosquitoes\r\nby feeding upon their aquatic larvae. This accounts for its other\r\nname—mosquito fish—and for its popularity with humans. But its services\r\nto us are not the measure of the gambusia’s importance, for it is a link\r\nin many food chains in the park’s brackish and fresh-water habitats.\r\nBeginning with algae, we can trace one such chain through mosquito\r\nlarvae, sunfish, and bass, to end with the alligator. We can only guess\r\nat the extent of the ecological effects of the loss of a single species\r\nsuch as the little gambusia.\r\n\r\nThe larger fish of Everglades are the most sought after. Sport fishermen\r\nwant to know where to find and how to recognize the many varieties of\r\ngame fish, especially largemouth bass and such famed salt-water and\r\nbrackish zone species as tarpon, snook, mangrove snapper, and barracuda.\r\nBecause of its cycles of flood and drought, and the shifting brackish\r\nzones, however, the distribution and the numbers of fish fluctuate\r\ngreatly in the glades and mangrove regions. At times of drought, the\r\nfish concentrations are particularly evident. In mid- or late winter,\r\nsloughs that are no longer deep enough to flow, pools, and other\r\nstanding bodies of water will have a myriad of gambusia, killifish, and\r\nminnows. Larger fish seek the sanctuary of the headwaters of the Harney,\r\nShark, and Broad Rivers. At such times concentrations of bass may be so\r\ngreat that the angler may catch his daily limit in a few hours. (There\r\nare no legal limits for the herons and ’gators!)\r\n\r\nAs water levels continue to fall, salt water intrudes farther inland;\r\nsuch species as snook and tarpon move up the now brackish rivers, and\r\nmay be seen in the same waters as bluegills and largemouth bass.\r\n\r\nIn some years water levels drop so severely that concentrations of fish\r\nare too great for the habitat to support. As the surface water shrinks,\r\nthe fish use up the available free oxygen and begin to die. The largest\r\nexpire first; the smaller fish seem less vulnerable to depleted oxygen\r\nsupply. Even though many tons of fish may perish in such a die-off, a\r\nfew small specimens of each variety survive to restock the glades when\r\nthe rains return.\r\n\r\nWith no cold season when fish must remain dormant, and with a year-round\r\nfood supply, bass and sunfish grow rapidly and reach breeding size\r\nbefore the next drought.\r\n\r\nThese fish kills are associated with drought conditions that occur in\r\nthe ordinary course of events, and thus are natural phenomena not to be\r\nconsidered ecological disasters. But man’s violent upsetting of the\r\ndrainage patterns of south Florida, through airport, canal, and highway\r\nconstruction and other developments, can bring about such drastic\r\nshortages (or even surpluses) of water that irreparable damage could be\r\ndone to the ecology of Everglades aquatic communities.\r\n\r\nWhile fish watching may not be the exciting sport that bird watching is,\r\nyou are the loser if you ignore this part of the life of Everglades.\r\nFish are so abundant in the park that no one has to haul them in on a\r\nline to discover them. You can hardly miss spotting the larger\r\nfresh-water forms if you take the trouble to look down into the sloughs,\r\nponds, and alligator holes.\r\n\r\nIdentifying the species of fish, however, is more difficult. The\r\nvoracious-looking Florida spotted gar is an exception. This important\r\npredator on smaller fishes, which is in turn a major item in the diet of\r\nthe alligator, is quite easily recognized. Experienced anglers will spot\r\nthe largemouthed bass and the bluegill sunfish. You’ll see these and\r\nothers as you walk on the Anhinga Trail boardwalk.\r\n\r\nAs you watch alligators and other native Everglades predators, you may\r\nget an inkling of how important in the web of life are the prolific fish\r\npopulations of the sloughs, marshes, swamps, and offshore waters of the\r\npark.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Animals without Backbones\r\n\r\nInsects are the most noticeable of the park’s invertebrates. (At times\r\nyou may find your can of repellent as important as your shoes!) In all\r\nthe fresh-water and brackish environments, insects and their larvae are\r\nimportant links in the food chains—at the beginning as primary consumers\r\nof algae and other plant material, and farther along as predators,\r\nmostly on other insects. Some insects are parasites on the park’s\r\nwarmblooded animals (including you).\r\n\r\nThe invertebrates most sought by visitors are molluscs—or rather, their\r\nshells. You may find a few on the beach at Cape Sable, but don’t expect\r\nto find the park a productive shelling area. Stick to marine\r\nshells—_dead_ ones. You cannot collect the fresh-water molluscs. Also\r\nprotected are the tree snails of jungle hammocks. Famed for their\r\nbeauty, these snails of the genus _Liguus_, which grow to as much as 2½\r\ninches in diameter, feed upon the lichens growing on certain hammock\r\ntrees. Look for them—but leave them undisturbed, for they are a part of\r\nthe community, protected just as are the park’s royal palms and its\r\nalligators.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INDIANS IN SOUTH FLORIDA]\r\n\r\n\r\n  BIG CYPRESS INDIAN RESERVATION\r\n  FLORIDA STATE SEMINOLE INDIAN RESERVATION\r\n  DANIA INDIAN RESERVATION\r\n  SCATTERED MOUNDS THROUGHOUT SHARK VALLEY\r\n  RUSSELL KEY\r\n  TURNER RIVER\r\n  LOPEZ RIVER\r\n  HOUSTON RIVER\r\n  MORMON KEY\r\n  GOPHER KEY\r\n  JOHNSON MOUND\r\n  FARM CREEK MOUND\r\n  EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK\r\n  MONROE LAKE\r\n  EAST CAPE MOUNDS\r\n  _GULF OF MEXICO_\r\n  _FLORIDA BAY_\r\n  _ATLANTIC OCEAN_\r\n  Indian Mounds\r\n  Indian Villages\r\n  Big Cypress Swamp\r\n  Mangrove Swamp\r\n  Pine Rockland\r\n  Coastal Prairie\r\n  Everglades\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       INDIANS OF THE EVERGLADES\r\n\r\n\r\nYour first awareness of the south Florida Indians will probably come\r\nduring a trip along the Tamiami Trail (U.S. 41, the cross-State highway\r\njust north of the park). You will notice clusters of Indian homes close\r\nto the road. Some are built on stilts, are thatched with palm fronds,\r\nand are open-sided so that no walls hamper the flow of cooling breezes.\r\nMany of the glades Indians prefer to live as their ancestors did some\r\n150 years ago when they were newcomers to the everglades. Others have\r\nadopted the white man’s dwellings (as well as his occupations).\r\n\r\nThe Indians of south Florida—Miccosukees, sometimes called “Trail\r\nIndians”; and Muskogees, the “Cow Creek Seminoles”—are separate tribes,\r\nnot sharing a common language. Today no Indians live inside the park\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\nThe Indians arrived in Spanish Florida after the American Revolution.\r\nMany Creeks of Georgia and Alabama, crowded by the aggressive white man,\r\nfled south to the peninsula. They first settled in north Florida; when\r\nFlorida became a State in 1845 they had to retreat farther south. Driven\r\ninto the interior during the Seminole War of 1835, they eventually\r\nsettled in the everglades, where deer, fish, and fruit were available.\r\nThough their territory is now much more limited, they still retain much\r\nof their independent spirit, and have never signed a peace treaty with\r\nthe U.S. Government.\r\n\r\nMany earn their living operating air boats, as proprietors and employees\r\nof roadside businesses, and in a variety of jobs on farms and in cities.\r\nThe women create distinctive handicraft items, which find a ready market\r\nwith tourists.\r\n\r\nNo one is certain when the first Indians—the Calusas and\r\nTequestas—appeared in south Florida; it may have been more than 2,000\r\nyears ago. Even more than today’s glades Indians, these coastal Indians\r\nlived with the rhythm of river and tides, rain and drought. Hunting,\r\nfishing, and gathering of shellfish were their means of existence. We\r\nhave learned this much of their life from artifacts unearthed from the\r\nmany Indian mounds or washed up along the beaches. They lived on huge\r\nshell mounds, made pottery, used sharks’ teeth to make saws, and\r\nfashioned other tools from conch shells. They even built impoundments\r\nfor fish—a few remains of these can be seen today. They were ingenious\r\nhunters. (Ponce de León and his Spanish explorer-marauders were said to\r\nhave been turned back from the everglades by the deadly arrows these\r\nIndians fashioned from rushes.)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nFollowing the arrival of the Spanish, these early Indians disappeared\r\nfrom the scene. They were apparently wiped out, destroyed by the white\r\nman’s diseases as much as by his aggression; but some may have escaped\r\nto Cuba. Perhaps a handful of them were still in the everglades when the\r\nCreeks came down from the north in 1835, and were absorbed into the new\r\ntribe. Their known history ends here.\r\n\r\nProud, independent, and ingenious in wresting a living from the land and\r\nthe water, the Indians knew how to live with nature. Unlike the white\r\nman, they fitted into the plant-and-animal communities. Today these\r\ncommunities have been severely disrupted. In the few decades that the\r\nwhite man has been “developing” the region, he has broken every chain of\r\nlife described in this book.\r\n\r\nAlligator populations have been much reduced in south Florida; their\r\nchief prey, the garfish, has in some places become so numerous as to\r\nconstitute a nuisance (most of all to the fresh-water anglers, some of\r\nwhom had a hand in the killing of alligators). The pattern of waterflow\r\nover the glades, through the cypress swamps, and into the mangrove\r\nwilderness has been altered by highways and canals. Much of the habitat\r\nhas been wiped out by construction of homes and factories and by farming\r\noperations. An increasingly alarming development is the pollution of\r\nglades waters by agricultural chemicals.\r\n\r\nOnly through complete understanding of this fragile, unique subtropical\r\nworld can man reverse the destructive trend. Only through carefully\r\napplied protective and management practices can we make progress toward\r\nrestoring to the Everglades some of its lost splendor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Appendix\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Tropical thicket]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Glossary\r\n\r\nALGAE: (pronounced “AL-jee”) A group of plants (singular: ALGA,\r\npronounced “AL-ga”), one-celled or many-celled, having chlorophyll,\r\nwithout roots, and living in damp places or in water.\r\n\r\nBRACKISH WATER: Mixed fresh and salt water. Many species of plants and\r\nanimals of marine and fresh-water habitats are adapted to life in\r\nestuaries and coastal swamps and marshes, where the water varies greatly\r\nin degree of salinity. Some animal species can be found in all three\r\nhabitats.\r\n\r\nBROMELIAD: A plant of the pineapple family. Many bromeliads are air\r\nplants, growing (not parasitically) on the trunks and branches of other\r\nplants, or even, as in the case of “Spanish moss,” on telephone wires.\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY: The living part of the ecosystem; an assemblage of plants and\r\nanimals living in a particular area or physical habitat. It can be as\r\nsmall as a decaying log, with its variety of mosses, insect larvae,\r\nburrowing beetles, ants, etc.; or as large as a forest of hundreds of\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\nDECIDUOUS TREES: Trees that shed their leaves annually. Most hardwood\r\ntrees are deciduous; some conifers, such as larches and baldcypresses,\r\nare deciduous.\r\n\r\nECOLOGY: The study of the relationship of living things to one another\r\nand to their physical environment.\r\n\r\nENDANGERED: A species of plant or animal that, throughout all or a\r\nsignificant portion of its range, is in danger of extinction.\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENT: All the external conditions, such as soil, water, air, and\r\norganisms, surrounding a living thing.\r\n\r\nESTIVATION: A prolonged dormant or sleeplike state that enables an\r\nanimal to survive the summer in a hot climate. As in hibernation,\r\nbreathing and heartbeat slow down, and the animal neither eats nor\r\ndrinks.\r\n\r\nESTUARY: The portion of a river or coastal wetland affected by the rise\r\nand fall of the tide, containing a graded mixture of fresh and salt\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nEVERGLADE: A tract of marshy land covered in places with tall grasses.\r\n(In this book, “the everglades” refers to the river of grass;\r\n“Everglades” refers to the park, which contains other habitats besides\r\neverglades.)\r\n\r\nEXOTIC: A foreign plant or animal that has been introduced,\r\nintentionally or unintentionally, into a new area.\r\n\r\nFOOD CHAIN: A series of plants and animals linked by their food\r\nrelationships, beginning with a green plant and ending with a predator.\r\n\r\nHABITAT: The place where an organism lives; the immediate surroundings,\r\nliving and unliving, of an organism. The habitat of the pine warbler is\r\nthe pinelands; the habitat of an internal parasite of this bird is the\r\nbody of the warbler.\r\n\r\nHAMMOCK: A dense growth of broad-leaved trees on a slightly elevated\r\narea, not wet enough to be a swamp. In the park, hammocks are surrounded\r\neither by pineland or by marshland (glades).\r\n\r\nHARDWOOD TREES: Trees with broad leaves (as opposed to conebearing\r\ntrees, which have needles or scales). Most hardwood trees are deciduous,\r\nthough many in south Florida retain their leaves throughout the year.\r\n\r\nKEY: A reef or low-lying island. In south Florida, the term “key” is\r\noften also applied to hammocks or pinelands, which occupy areas where\r\nthe limestone is raised above the surrounding wetlands.\r\n\r\nLIMESTONE: A sedimentary rock derived from the shells and skeletons of\r\nanimals deposited in seas, and consisting mostly of calcium carbonate.\r\nSoluble in water having a slight degree of acidity, it is often\r\ncharacterized by caverns and, in the everglades, by a very pitted\r\nsurface. The rock underlying most of the park is the Miami Oölite\r\n(pronounced OH-uh-lite), formed during a recent glacial period. Oölitic\r\nlimestone is composed of tiny round concretions, only indirectly derived\r\nfrom marine shells.\r\n\r\nMANGROVE: Any of a group of tropical or subtropical trees, growing in\r\nestuaries and other low-lying coastal areas, usually producing aerial\r\nroots or prop roots and often forming dense growths over a large area.\r\nIn south Florida there are four species, belonging to three different\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nMARSH: A wetland, salt or fresh, where few if any trees and shrubs grow,\r\ncharacterized by grasses and sedges; in fresh-water marshes, cattails\r\nare common.\r\n\r\nMARL: In this book, used in the sense of a deposit of mixed limestone\r\nand smaller amounts of clay; south Florida marls are sometimes called\r\nlime muds.\r\n\r\nPEAT: Partly decayed, moisture-absorbing plant matter accumulated in\r\nbogs, swamps, etc.\r\n\r\nPREDATOR: An animal that lives by capturing other animals for food.\r\n\r\nSLOUGH: A channel of slow-moving water in coastal marshland. The Shark\r\nRiver Slough and Taylor Slough are the main channels where the glades\r\nwater flows in the park. Generally remaining as reservoirs of water when\r\nthe glades dry in the rainless season, they are important to survival of\r\naquatic animals.\r\n\r\nSWAMP: Wetland characterized by shrubs or trees such as maples, gums,\r\nbaldcypresses, and, in south Florida coast areas, mangroves. Fresh-water\r\nswamps are usually not covered by water the year around.\r\n\r\nTHREATENED: A species still present in its range but that, without\r\nsignificant changes in conditions, is capable of becoming endangered.\r\n\r\nTREE ISLAND: An island of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants growing\r\non an elevation, in a depression, or at the same level as the\r\nsurrounding glades. Includes hammocks, willow heads, cypress heads, and\r\nbayheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       For Reading and Reference\r\n\r\nAshton, Ray Jr., and Patricia Sawyer Ashton. _Handbook of Reptiles and\r\nAmphibians of Florida._ Vol. 1, _The Snakes_; Vol. 2, _Lizards, Turtles\r\nand Crocodilians_; Vol. 3, _The Amphibians_.

As noted in this list many birds are known\r\nin the park from only a few sightings. A few are exotic birds that have\r\nescaped captivity. Species considered exotic to Everglades Park are\r\nmarked with an asterisk (*). Users can contribute to updating future\r\nlists by carefully recording details of their observations of less\r\ncommon species and reporting that information to park personnel.

A tree-like\r\nplant is one with the general shape and size of a tree, but one which is\r\nnot woody or otherwise fails to meet the definition. The arrangement of\r\nfamilies is generally the same as that of Small’s _Manual of\r\nSoutheastern Flora_ (1933) and Long and Lakela’s _A Flora of Tropical\r\nFlorida_ (1971). Genera and species are listed alphabetically in each\r\nfamily. Nomenclature follows Avery and Loope, _Plants of Everglades\r\nNational Park: A Preliminary Checklist of Vascular Plants_ (1983). In\r\nthe checklist, the introduced species are followed by a symbol, key\r\nbelow, that describes the plants’ success in the Everglades. Native\r\nplants list only their name.\r\n\r\n  We  Well established. An exotic plant that has become widely\r\n      naturalized, with a large population.\r\n  Sl  Slightly naturalized. An exotic plant that has a small foothold,\r\n      often found near a mature tree that acts as a seed source.\r\n  Pr  Persistent. An exotic plant that goes on living for a long time\r\n      after it is planted, and that may appear to be native or\r\n      naturalized.\r\n  Sm  Small, rarely tree-sized. A plant that may sometimes become a\r\n      tree, but that often does not meet the definition.\r\n  Cu  Cultivated only. Known only as a cultivated species, but which is\r\n      retained on this list because either Small or Long and Lakela\r\n      treat it as native or naturalized.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PINE FAMILY:
