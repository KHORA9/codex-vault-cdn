Huxley\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCHANTS occasionally go through a wholesome, though troublesome and\r\nnot always satisfactory, process which they term \"taking stock.\" After\r\nall the excitement of speculation, the pleasure of gain, and the pain of\r\nloss, the trader makes up his mind to face facts and to learn the exact\r\nquantity and quality of his solid and reliable possessions.\r\n\r\nThe man of science does well sometimes to imitate this procedure; and,\r\nforgetting for the time the importance of his own small winnings, to\r\nre-examine the common stock in trade, so that he may make sure how far\r\nthe stock of bullion in the cellar--on the faith of whose existence so\r\nmuch paper has been circulating--is really the solid gold of truth.\r\n\r\nThe Anniversary Meeting of the Geological Society seems to be an\r\noccasion well suited for an undertaking of this kind--for an inquiry,\r\nin fact, into the nature and value of the present results of\r\npaleontological investigation; and the more so, as all those who have\r\npaid close attention to the late multitudinous discussions in which\r\npaleontology is implicated, must have felt the urgent necessity of some\r\nsuch scrutiny.\r\n\r\nFirst in order, as the most definite and unquestionable of all the\r\nresults of paleontology, must be mentioned the immense extension and\r\nimpulse given to botany, zoology, and comparative anatomy, by the\r\ninvestigation of fossil remains. Indeed, the mass of biological facts\r\nhas been so greatly increased, and the range of biological speculation\r\nhas been so vastly widened, by the researches of the geologist and\r\npaleontologist, that it is to be feared there are naturalists in\r\nexistence who look upon geology as Brindley regarded rivers. \"Rivers,\"\r\nsaid the great engineer, \"were made to feed canals\"; and geology, some\r\nseem to think, was solely created to advance comparative anatomy.\r\n\r\nWere such a thought justifiable, it could hardly expect to be received\r\nwith favour by this assembly. But it is not justifiable. Your favourite\r\nscience has her own great aims independent of all others; and if,\r\nnotwithstanding her steady devotion to her own progress, she can scatter\r\nsuch rich alms among her sisters, it should be remembered that her\r\ncharity is of the sort that does not impoverish, but \"blesseth him that\r\ngives and him that takes.\"\r\n\r\nRegard the matter as we will, however, the facts remain. Nearly 40,000\r\nspecies of animals and plants have been added to the Systema Naturae by\r\npaleontologic research. This is a living population equivalent to\r\nthat of a new continent in mere number; equivalent to that of a new\r\nhemisphere, if we take into account the small population of insects as\r\nyet found fossil, and the large proportion and peculiar organization of\r\nmany of the Vertebrata.\r\n\r\nBut, beyond this, it is perhaps not too much to say that, except for the\r\nnecessity of interpreting paleontologic facts, the laws of distribution\r\nwould have received less careful study; while few comparative anatomists\r\n(and those not of the first order) would have been induced by mere love\r\nof detail, as such, to study the minutiae of osteology, were it not\r\nthat in such minutiae lie the only keys to the most interesting riddles\r\noffered by the extinct animal world.\r\n\r\nThese assuredly are great and solid gains. Surely it is matter for no\r\nsmall congratulation that in half a century (for paleontology, though\r\nit dawned earlier, came into full day only with Cuvier) a subordinate\r\nbranch of biology should have doubled the value and the interest of the\r\nwhole group of sciences to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Allied with geology, paleontology has established\r\ntwo laws of inestimable importance: the first, that one and the same\r\narea of the earth's surface has been successively occupied by very\r\ndifferent kinds of living beings; the second, that the order of\r\nsuccession established in one locality holds good, approximately, in\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe first of these laws is universal and irreversible; the second is an\r\ninduction from a vast number of observations, though it may possibly,\r\nand even probably, have to admit of exceptions. As a consequence of\r\nthe second law, it follows that a peculiar relation frequently subsists\r\nbetween series of strata, containing organic remains, in different\r\nlocalities. The series resemble one another, not only in virtue of\r\na general resemblance of the organic remains in the two, but also\r\nin virtue of a resemblance in the order and character of the serial\r\nsuccession in each. There is a resemblance of arrangement; so that the\r\nseparate terms of each series, as well as the whole series, exhibit a\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nSuccession implies time; the lower members of a series of sedimentary\r\nrocks are certainly older than the upper; and when the notion of age was\r\nonce introduced as the equivalent of succession, it was no wonder that\r\ncorrespondence in succession came to be looked upon as a correspondence\r\nin age, or \"contemporaneity.\" And, indeed, so long as relative age only\r\nis spoken of, correspondence in succession 'is' correspondence in age;\r\nit is 'relative' contemporaneity.\r\n\r\nBut it would have been very much better for geology if so loose and\r\nambiguous a word as \"contemporaneous\" had been excluded from her\r\nterminology, and if, in its stead, some term expressing similarity of\r\nserial relation, and excluding the notion of time altogether, had been\r\nemployed to denote correspondence in position in two or more series of\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nIn anatomy, where such correspondence of position has constantly to be\r\nspoken of, it is denoted by the word \"homology\" and its derivatives; and\r\nfor Geology (which after all is only the anatomy and physiology of the\r\nearth) it might be well to invent some single word, such as \"homotaxis\"\r\n(similarity of order), in order to express an essentially similar idea.\r\nThis, however, has not been done, and most probably the inquiry will at\r\nonce be made--To what end burden science with a new and strange term in\r\nplace of one old, familiar, and part of our common language?\r\n\r\nThe reply to this question will become obvious as the inquiry into the\r\nresults of paleontology is pushed further.\r\n\r\nThose whose business it is to acquaint themselves specially with the\r\nworks of paleontologists, in fact, will be fully aware that very few,\r\nif any, would rest satisfied with such a statement of the conclusions of\r\ntheir branch of biology as that which has just been given.\r\n\r\nOur standard repertories of paleontology profess to teach us far higher\r\nthings--to disclose the entire succession of living forms upon the\r\nsurface of the globe; to tell us of a wholly different distribution of\r\nclimatic conditions in ancient times; to reveal the character of the\r\nfirst of all living existences; and to trace out the law of progress\r\nfrom them to us.\r\n\r\nIt may not be unprofitable to bestow on these professions a somewhat\r\nmore critical examination than they have hitherto received, in order to\r\nascertain how far they rest on an irrefragable basis; or whether, after\r\nall, it might not be well for paleontologists to learn a little more\r\ncarefully that scientific \"ars artium,\" the art of saying \"I don't\r\nknow.\" And to this end let us define somewhat more exactly the extent of\r\nthese pretensions of paleontology.\r\n\r\nEvery one is aware that Professor Bronn's 'Untersuchungen' and Professor\r\nPictet's 'Traite de Paleontologie' are works of standard authority,\r\nfamiliarly consulted by every working paleontologist. It is desirable to\r\nspeak of these excellent books, and of their distinguished authors,\r\nwith the utmost respect, and in a tone as far as possible removed from\r\ncarping criticism; indeed, if they are specially cited in this place,\r\nit is merely in justification of the assertion that the following\r\npropositions, which may be found implicitly, or explicitly, in the works\r\nin question, are regarded by the mass of paleontologists and geologists,\r\nnot only on the Continent but in this country, as expressing some of the\r\nbest-established results of paleontology. Thus:--\r\n\r\nAnimals and plants began their existence together, not long after\r\nthe commencement of the deposition of the sedimentary rocks; and then\r\nsucceeded one another, in such a manner, that totally distinct faunae\r\nand florae occupied the whole surface of the earth, one after the other,\r\nand during distinct epochs of time.\r\n\r\nA geological formation is the sum of all the strata deposited over the\r\nwhole surface of the earth during one of these epochs: a geological\r\nfauna or flora is the sum of all the species of animals or plants which\r\noccupied the whole surface of the globe, during one of these epochs.\r\n\r\nThe population of the earth's surface was at first very similar in all\r\nparts, and only from the middle of the Tertiary epoch onwards, began to\r\nshow a distinct distribution in zones.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the original population, as well as the numerical\r\nproportions of its members, indicates a warmer and, on the whole,\r\nsomewhat tropical climate, which remained tolerably equable throughout\r\nthe year. The subsequent distribution of living beings in zones is the\r\nresult of a gradual lowering of the general temperature, which first\r\nbegan to be felt at the poles.\r\n\r\nIt is not now proposed to inquire whether these doctrines are true\r\nor false; but to direct your attention to a much simpler though very\r\nessential preliminary question--What is their logical basis? what are\r\nthe fundamental assumptions upon which they all logically depend? and\r\nwhat is the evidence on which those fundamental propositions demand our\r\nassent?\r\n\r\nThese assumptions are two: the first, that the commencement of the\r\ngeological record is coeval with the commencement of life on the\r\nglobe; the second, that geological contemporaneity is the same thing as\r\nchronological synchrony. Without the first of these assumptions\r\nthere would of course be no ground for any statement respecting the\r\ncommencement of life; without the second, all the other statements\r\ncited, every one of which implies a knowledge of the state of different\r\nparts of the earth at one and the same time, will be no less devoid of\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nThe first assumption obviously rests entirely on negative evidence. This\r\nis, of course, the only evidence that ever can be available to prove the\r\ncommencement of any series of phenomena; but, at the same time, it must\r\nbe recollected that the value of negative evidence depends entirely on\r\nthe amount of positive corroboration it receives. If A B wishes to prove\r\nan 'alibi', it is of no use for him to get a thousand witnesses simply\r\nto swear that they did not see him in such and such a place, unless the\r\nwitnesses are prepared to prove that they must have seen him had he\r\nbeen there. But the evidence that animal life commenced with the\r\nLingula-flags, 'e.g.', would seem to be exactly of this unsatisfactory\r\nuncorroborated sort. The Cambrian witnesses simply swear they \"haven't\r\nseen anybody their way\"; upon which the counsel for the other side\r\nimmediately puts in ten or twelve thousand feet of Devonian sandstones\r\nto make oath they never saw a fish or a mollusk, though all the world\r\nknows there were plenty in their time.\r\n\r\nBut then it is urged that, though the Devonian rocks in one part of the\r\nworld exhibit no fossils, in another they do, while the lower Cambrian\r\nrocks nowhere exhibit fossils, and hence no living being could have\r\nexisted in their epoch.\r\n\r\nTo this there are two replies: the first, that the observational basis\r\nof the assertion that the lowest rocks are nowhere fossiliferous is an\r\namazingly small one, seeing how very small an area, in comparison to\r\nthat of the whole world, has yet been fully searched; the second, that\r\nthe argument is good for nothing unless the unfossiliferous rocks in\r\nquestion were not only 'contemporaneous' in the geological sense,\r\nbut 'synchronous' in the chronological sense. To use the 'alibi'\r\nillustration again. If a man wishes to prove he was in neither of two\r\nplaces, A and B, on a given day, his witnesses for each place must be\r\nprepared to answer for the whole day. If they can only prove that he was\r\nnot at A in the morning, and not at B in the afternoon, the evidence of\r\nhis absence from both is 'nil', because he might have been at B in the\r\nmorning and at A in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThus everything depends upon the validity of the second assumption.\r\nAnd we must proceed to inquire what is the real meaning of the word\r\n\"contemporaneous\" as employed by geologists. To this end a concrete\r\nexample may be taken.\r\n\r\nThe Lias of England and the Lias of Germany, the Cretaceous rocks\r\nof Britain and the Cretaceous rocks of Southern India, are termed by\r\ngeologists \"contemporaneous\" formations; but whenever any thoughtful\r\ngeologist is asked whether he means to say that they were deposited\r\nsynchronously, he says, \"No,--only within the same great epoch.\" And if,\r\nin pursuing the inquiry, he is asked what may be the approximate value\r\nin time of a \"great epoch\"--whether it means a hundred years, or a\r\nthousand, or a million, or ten million years--his reply is, \"I cannot\r\ntell.\"\r\n\r\nIf the further question be put, whether physical geology is in\r\npossession of any method by which the actual synchrony (or the reverse)\r\nof any two distant deposits can be ascertained, no such method can be\r\nheard of; it being admitted by all the best authorities that neither\r\nsimilarity of mineral composition, nor of physical character, nor even\r\ndirect continuity of stratum, are 'absolute' proofs of the synchronism\r\nof even approximated sedimentary strata: while, for distant deposits,\r\nthere seems to be no kind of physical evidence attainable of a nature\r\ncompetent to decide whether such deposits were formed simultaneously, or\r\nwhether they possess any given difference of antiquity. To return to an\r\nexample already given: All competent authorities will probably assent to\r\nthe proposition that physical geology does not enable us in any way to\r\nreply to this question--Were the British Cretaceous rocks deposited at\r\nthe same time as those of India, or are they a million of years younger\r\nor a million of years older?\r\n\r\nIs paleontology able to succeed where physical geology fails? Standard\r\nwriters on paleontology, as has been seen, assume that she can. They\r\ntake it for granted, that deposits containing similar organic remains\r\nare synchronous--at any rate in a broad sense; and yet, those who will\r\nstudy the eleventh and twelfth chapters of Sir Henry De La Beche's\r\nremarkable 'Researches in Theoretical Geology', published now nearly\r\nthirty years ago, and will carry out the arguments there most luminously\r\nstated, to their logical consequences, may very easily convince\r\nthemselves that even absolute identity of organic contents is no proof\r\nof the synchrony of deposits, while absolute diversity is no proof of\r\ndifference of date. Sir Henry De La Beche goes even further, and adduces\r\nconclusive evidence to show that the different parts of one and the same\r\nstratum, having a similar composition throughout, containing the same\r\norganic remains, and having similar beds above and below it, may yet\r\ndiffer to any conceivable extent in age.\r\n\r\nEdward Forbes was in the habit of asserting that the similarity of the\r\norganic contents of distant formations was 'prima facie' evidence, not\r\nof their similarity, but of their difference of age; and holding as\r\nhe did the doctrine of single specific centres, the conclusion was as\r\nlegitimate as any other; for the two districts must have been occupied\r\nby migration from one of the two, or from an intermediate spot, and\r\nthe chances against exact coincidence of migration and of imbedding are\r\ninfinite.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, however, whether the hypothesis of single or of\r\nmultiple specific centres be adopted, similarity of organic contents\r\ncannot possibly afford any proof of the synchrony of the deposits which\r\ncontain them; on the contrary, it is demonstrably compatible with\r\nthe lapse of the most prodigious intervals of time, and with the\r\ninterposition of vast changes in the organic and inorganic worlds,\r\nbetween the epochs in which such deposits were formed.\r\n\r\nOn what amount of similarity of their faunae is the doctrine of the\r\ncontemporaneity of the European and of the North American Silurians\r\nbased? In the last edition of Sir Charles Lyell's 'Elementary Geology'\r\nit is stated, on the authority of a former President of this Society,\r\nthe late Daniel Sharpe, that between 30 and 40 per cent. of the species\r\nof Silurian Mollusca are common to both sides of the Atlantic. By way of\r\ndue allowance for further discovery, let us double the lesser number\r\nand suppose that 60 per cent. of the species are common to the North\r\nAmerican and the British Silurians. Sixty per cent. of species in common\r\nis, then, proof of contemporaneity.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that, a million or two of years hence, when Britain has\r\nmade another dip beneath the sea and has come up again, some geologist\r\napplies this doctrine, in comparing the strata laid bare by the upheaval\r\nof the bottom, say, of St. George's Channel with what may then remain of\r\nthe Suffolk Crag. Reasoning in the same way, he will at once decide the\r\nSuffolk Crag and the St. George's Channel beds to be contemporaneous;\r\nalthough we happen to know that a vast period (even in the geological\r\nsense) of time, and physical changes of almost unprecedented extent,\r\nseparate the two.\r\n\r\nBut if it be a demonstrable fact that strata containing more than 60 or\r\n70 per cent. of species of Mollusca in common, and comparatively\r\nclose together, may yet be separated by an amount of geological time\r\nsufficient to allow of some of the greatest physical changes the world\r\nhas seen, what becomes of that sort of contemporaneity the sole evidence\r\nof which is a similarity of facies, or the identity of half a dozen\r\nspecies, or of a good many genera?\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is no better evidence for the contemporaneity assumed\r\nby all who adopt the hypothesis of universal faunae and florae, of a\r\nuniversally uniform climate, and of a sensible cooling of the globe\r\nduring geological time.\r\n\r\nThere seems, then, no escape from the admission that neither physical\r\ngeology, nor paleontology, possesses any method by which the absolute\r\nsynchronism of two strata can be demonstrated. All that geology can\r\nprove is local order of succession. It is mathematically certain\r\nthat, in any given vertical linear section of an undisturbed series of\r\nsedimentary deposits, the bed which lies lowest is the oldest. In\r\nmany other vertical linear sections of the same series, of course,\r\ncorresponding beds will occur in a similar order; but, however great may\r\nbe the probability, no man can say with absolute certainty that the beds\r\nin the two sections were synchronously deposited. For areas of moderate\r\nextent, it is doubtless true that no practical evil is likely to result\r\nfrom assuming the corresponding beds to be synchronous or strictly\r\ncontemporaneous; and there are multitudes of accessory circumstances\r\nwhich may fully justify the assumption of such synchrony. But the moment\r\nthe geologist has to deal with large areas, or with completely separated\r\ndeposits, the mischief of confounding that \"homotaxis\" or \"similarity of\r\narrangement,\" which 'can' be demonstrated, with \"synchrony\" or \"identity\r\nof date,\" for which there is not a shadow of proof, under the one common\r\nterm of \"contemporaneity\" becomes incalculable, and proves the constant\r\nsource of gratuitous speculations.\r\n\r\nFor anything that geology or paleontology are able to show to the\r\ncontrary, a Devonian fauna and flora in the British Islands may have\r\nbeen contemporaneous with Silurian life in North America, and with a\r\nCarboniferous fauna and flora in Africa. Geographical provinces and\r\nzones may have been as distinctly marked in the Paleozoic epoch as\r\nat present, and those seemingly sudden appearances of new genera and\r\nspecies, which we ascribe to new creation, may be simple results of\r\nmigration.\r\n\r\nIt may be so; it may be otherwise. In the present condition of our\r\nknowledge and of our methods, one verdict--\"not proven, and not\r\nprovable\"--must be recorded against all the grand hypotheses of the\r\npaleontologist respecting the general succession of life on the\r\nglobe. The order and nature of terrestrial life, as a whole, are\r\nopen questions. Geology at present provides us with most valuable\r\ntopographical records, but she has not the means of working them into a\r\nuniversal history. Is such a universal history, then, to be regarded as\r\nunattainable? Are all the grandest and most interesting problems which\r\noffer themselves to the geological student essentially insoluble? Is he\r\nin the position of a scientific Tantalus--doomed always to thirst for\r\na knowledge which he cannot obtain? The reverse is to be hoped; nay, it\r\nmay not be impossible to indicate the source whence help will come.\r\n\r\nIn commencing these remarks, mention was made of the great obligations\r\nunder which the naturalist lies to the geologist and paleontologist.\r\nAssuredly the time will come when these obligations will be repaid\r\ntenfold, and when the maze of the world's past history, through which\r\nthe pure geologist and the pure paleontologist find no guidance, will be\r\nsecurely threaded by the clue furnished by the naturalist.\r\n\r\nAll who are competent to express an opinion on the subject are, at\r\npresent, agreed that the manifold varieties of animal and vegetable\r\nform have not either come into existence by chance, nor result from\r\ncapricious exertions of creative power; but that they have taken place\r\nin a definite order, the statement of which order is what men of\r\nscience term a natural law. Whether such a law is to be regarded as an\r\nexpression of the mode of operation of natural forces, or whether it\r\nis simply a statement of the manner in which a supernatural power has\r\nthought fit to act, is a secondary question, so long as the existence of\r\nthe law and the possibility of its discovery by the human intellect are\r\ngranted. But he must be a half-hearted philosopher who, believing\r\nin that possibility, and having watched the gigantic strides of the\r\nbiological sciences during the last twenty years, doubts that science\r\nwill sooner or later make this further step, so as to become possessed\r\nof the law of evolution of organic forms--of the unvarying order of that\r\ngreat chain of causes and effects of which all organic forms, ancient\r\nand modern, are the links. And then, if ever, we shall be able to begin\r\nto discuss, with profit, the questions respecting the commencement of\r\nlife, and the nature of the successive populations of the globe, which\r\nso many seem to think are already answered.\r\n\r\nThe preceding arguments make no particular claim to novelty; indeed\r\nthey have been floating more or less distinctly before the minds of\r\ngeologists for the last thirty years; and if, at the present time,\r\nit has seemed desirable to give them more definite and systematic\r\nexpression, it is because paleontology is every day assuming a greater\r\nimportance, and now requires to rest on a basis the firmness of which is\r\nthoroughly well assured. Among its fundamental conceptions, there\r\nmust be no confusion between what is certain and what is more or less\r\nprobable. [2] But, pending the construction of a surer foundation than\r\npaleontology now possesses, it may be instructive, assuming for the\r\nnonce the general correctness of the ordinary hypothesis of geological\r\ncontemporaneity, to consider whether the deductions which are ordinarily\r\ndrawn from the whole body of paleontologic facts are justifiable.\r\n\r\nThe evidence on which such conclusions are based is of two kinds,\r\nnegative and positive. The value of negative evidence, in connection\r\nwith this inquiry, has been so fully and clearly discussed in an address\r\nfrom the chair of this Society [3], which none of us have forgotten,\r\nthat nothing need at present be said about it; the more, as the\r\nconsiderations which have been laid before you have certainly not tended\r\nto increase your estimation of such evidence. It will be preferable to\r\nturn to the positive facts of paleontology, and to inquire what they\r\ntell us.\r\n\r\nWe are all accustomed to speak of the number and the extent of the\r\nchanges in the living population of the globe during geological time\r\nas something enormous: and indeed they are so, if we regard only the\r\nnegative differences which separate the older rocks from the more\r\nmodern, and if we look upon specific and generic changes as great\r\nchanges, which from one point of view, they truly are. But leaving\r\nthe negative differences out of consideration, and looking only at the\r\npositive data furnished by the fossil world from a broader point of\r\nview--from that of the comparative anatomist who has made the study of\r\nthe greater modifications of animal form his chief business--a surprise\r\nof another kind dawns upon the mind; and under 'this' aspect the\r\nsmallness of the total change becomes as astonishing as was its\r\ngreatness under the other.\r\n\r\nThere are two hundred known orders of plants; of these not one is\r\ncertainly known to exist exclusively in the fossil state. The whole\r\nlapse of geological time has as yet yielded not a single new ordinal\r\ntype of vegetable structure. [4]\r\n\r\nThe positive change in passing from the recent to the ancient animal\r\nworld is greater, but still singularly small. No fossil animal is so\r\ndistinct from those now living as to require to be arranged even in a\r\nseparate class from those which contain existing forms. It is only when\r\nwe come to the orders, which may be roughly estimated at about a hundred\r\nand thirty, that we meet with fossil animals so distinct from those now\r\nliving as to require orders for themselves; and these do not amount, on\r\nthe most liberal estimate, to more than about 10 per cent. of the whole.\r\n\r\nThere is no certainly known extinct order of Protozoa; there is but one\r\namong the Coelenterata--that of the rugose corals; there is none\r\namong the Mollusca; there are three, the Cystidea, Blastoidea, and\r\nEdrioasterida, among the Echinoderms; and two, the Trilobita and\r\nEurypterida, among the Crustacea; making altogether five for the\r\ngreat sub-kingdom of Annulosa. Among Vertebrates there is no ordinally\r\ndistinct fossil fish: there is only one extinct order of Amphibia--the\r\nLabyrinthodonts; but there are at least four distinct orders of\r\nReptilia, viz. the Ichthyosauria, Plesiosauria, Pterosauria, Dinosauria,\r\nand perhaps another or two. There is no known extinct order of\r\nBirds, and no certainly known extinct order of Mammals, the ordinal\r\ndistinctness of the \"Toxodontia\" being doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe objection that broad statements of this kind, after all, rest\r\nlargely on negative evidence is obvious, but it has less force than may\r\nat first be supposed; for, as might be expected from the circumstances\r\nof the case, we possess more abundant positive evidence regarding Fishes\r\nand marine Mollusks than respecting any other forms of animal life;\r\nand yet these offer us, through the whole range of geological time, no\r\nspecies ordinally distinct from those now living; while the far less\r\nnumerous class of Echinoderms presents three; and the Crustacea two,\r\nsuch orders, though none of these come down later than the Paleozoic\r\nage. Lastly, the Reptilia present the extraordinary and exceptional\r\nphenomenon of as many extinct as existing orders, if not more; the\r\nfour mentioned maintaining their existence from the Lias to the Chalk\r\ninclusive.\r\n\r\nSome years ago one of your Secretaries pointed out another kind\r\nof positive paleontologic evidence tending towards the same\r\nconclusion--afforded by the existence of what he termed \"persistent\r\ntypes\" of vegetable and of animal life. [5] He stated, on the authority\r\nof Dr. Hooker, that there are Carboniferous plants which appear to be\r\ngenerically identical with some now living; that the cone of the Oolitic\r\n'Araucaria' is hardly distinguishable from that of an existing species;\r\nthat a true 'Pinus' appears in the Purbecks, and a 'Juglans' in the\r\nChalk; while, from the Bagshot Sands, a 'Banksia', the wood of which is\r\nnot distinguishable from that of species now living in Australia, had\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\nTurning to the animal kingdom, he affirmed the tabulate corals of the\r\nSilurian rocks to be wonderfully like those which now exist; while even\r\nthe families of the Aporosa were all represented in the older Mesozoic\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAmong the Molluska similar facts were adduced. Let it be borne in mind\r\nthat 'Avicula', 'Mytails', 'Chiton', 'Natica', 'Patella', 'Trochus',\r\n'Discina', 'Orbicula', 'Lingula', 'Rhynchonella', and 'Nautilus', all\r\nof which are existing 'genera', are given without a doubt as Silurian\r\nin the last edition of 'Siluria'; while the highest forms of the highest\r\nCephalopods are represented in the Lias by a genus, 'Belemnoteuthis',\r\nwhich presents the closest relation to the existing 'Loligo'.\r\n\r\nThe two highest groups of the Annulosa, the Insecta and the Arachnida,\r\nare represented in the Coal, either by existing genera, or by forms\r\ndiffering from existing genera in quite minor peculiarities.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Vertebrata, the only Paleozoic Elasmobranch Fish of\r\nwhich we have any complete knowledge is the Devonian and Carboniferous\r\n'Pleuracanthus', which differs no more from existing Sharks than these\r\ndo from one another.\r\n\r\nAgain, vast as is the number of undoubtedly Ganoid fossil Fishes, and\r\ngreat as is their range in time, a large mass of evidence has recently\r\nbeen adduced to show that almost all those respecting which we possess\r\nsufficient information, are referable to the same sub-ordinal groups\r\nas the existing 'Lepidosteus', 'Polypterus', and Sturgeon; and that a\r\nsingular relation obtains between the older and the younger Fishes;\r\nthe former, the Devonian Ganoids, being almost all members of the same\r\nsub-order as 'Polypterus', while the Mesozoic Ganoids are almost all\r\nsimilarly allied to 'Lepidosteus'. [6]\r\n\r\nAgain, what can be more remarkable than the singular constancy of\r\nstructure preserved throughout a vast period of time by the family\r\nof the Pycnodonts and by that of the true Coelacanths; the former\r\npersisting, with but insignificant modifications, from the Carboniferous\r\nto the Tertiary rocks, inclusive; the latter existing, with still less\r\nchange, from the Carboniferous rocks to the Chalk, inclusive?\r\n\r\nAmong Reptiles, the highest living group, that of the Crocodilia,\r\nis represented, at the early part of the Mesozoic epoch, by species\r\nidentical in the essential characters of their organization with those\r\nnow living, and differing from the latter only in such matters as the\r\nform of the articular facets of the vertebral centra, in the extent to\r\nwhich the nasal passages are separated from the cavity of the mouth by\r\nbone, and in the proportions of the limbs.\r\n\r\nAnd even as regards the Mammalia, the scanty remains of Triassic and\r\nOolitic species afford no foundation for the supposition that the\r\norganization of the oldest forms differed nearly so much from some of\r\nthose which now live as these differ from one another.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to multiply these instances; enough has been said to\r\njustify the statement that, in view of the immense diversity of known\r\nanimal and vegetable forms, and the enormous lapse of time indicated by\r\nthe accumulation of fossiliferous strata, the only circumstance to be\r\nwondered at is, not that the changes of life, as exhibited by positive\r\nevidence, have been so great, but that they have been so small.\r\n\r\nBe they great or small, however, it is desirable to attempt to estimate\r\nthem. Let us, therefore, take each great division of the animal world in\r\nsuccession, and, whenever an order or a family can be shown to have had\r\na prolonged existence, let us endeavour to ascertain how far the later\r\nmembers of the group differ from the earlier ones. If these later\r\nmembers, in all or in many cases, exhibit a certain amount of\r\nmodification, the fact is, so far, evidence in favour of a general law\r\nof change; and, in a rough way, the rapidity of that change will be\r\nmeasured by the demonstrable amount of modification. On the other hand,\r\nit must be recollected that the absence of any modification, while\r\nit may leave the doctrine of the existence of a law of change without\r\npositive support, cannot possibly disprove all forms of that doctrine,\r\nthough it may afford a sufficient refutation of any of them.\r\n\r\nThe PROTOZOA.--The Protozoa are represented throughout the whole range\r\nof geological series, from the Lower Silurian formation to the present\r\nday. The most ancient forms recently made known by Ehrenberg are\r\nexceedingly like those which now exist: no one has ever pretended that\r\nthe difference between any ancient and any modern Foraminifera is of\r\nmore than generic value, nor are the oldest Foraminifera either simpler,\r\nmore embryonic, or less differentiated, than the existing forms.\r\n\r\nThe COELENTERATA.--The Tabulate Corals have existed from the Silurian\r\nepoch to the present day, but I am not aware that the ancient\r\n'Heliolites' possesses a single mark of a more embryonic or less\r\ndifferentiated character, or less high organization, than the existing\r\n'Heliopora'. As for the Aporose Corals, in what respect is the Silurian\r\n'Paleocyclus' less highly organized or more embryonic than the modern\r\n'Fungia', or the Liassic Aporosa than the existing members of the same\r\nfamilies?\r\n\r\nThe 'Mollusca'.--In what sense is the living 'Waldheimia' less\r\nembryonic, or more specialized; than the paleozoic 'Spirifer'; or the\r\nexisting 'Rhynchonellae', 'Craniae', 'Discinae', 'Lingulae', than the\r\nSilurian species of the same genera? In what sense can 'Loligo' or\r\n'Spirula' be said to be more specialized, or less embryonic, than\r\n'Belemnites'; or the modern species of Lamellibranch and Gasteropod\r\ngenera, than the Silurian species of the same genera?\r\n\r\nThe ANNULOSA.--The Carboniferous Insecta and Arachnida are neither less\r\nspecialized, nor more embryonic, than these that now live, nor are the\r\nLiassic Cirripedia and Macrura; while several of the Brachyura, which\r\nappear in the Chalk, belong to existing genera; and none exhibit either\r\nan intermediate, or an embryonic, character.\r\n\r\nThe VERTEBRARA.--Among fishes I have referred to the Coelacanthini\r\n(comprising the genera 'Coelacanthus', 'Holophagus', 'Undina', and\r\n'Macropoma') as affording an example of a persistent type; and it is\r\nmost remarkable to note the smallness of the differences between any of\r\nthese fishes (affecting at most the proportions of the body and fins,\r\nand the character and sculpture of the scales), notwithstanding their\r\nenormous range in time. In all the essentials of its very peculiar\r\nstructure, the 'Macropoma' of the Chalk is identical with the\r\n'Coelacanthus' of the Coal. Look at the genus 'Lepidotus', again,\r\npersisting without a modification of importance from the Liassic to the\r\nEocene formations inclusive.\r\n\r\nOr among the Teleostei--in what respect is the 'Beryx' of the Chalk\r\nmore embryonic, or less differentiated, than 'Beryx lineatus' of King\r\nGeorge's Sound?\r\n\r\nOr to turn to the higher Vertebrata--in what sense are the Liassic\r\nChelonia inferior to those which now exist? How are the Cretaceous\r\nIchthyosauria, Plesiosauria, or Pterosauria less embryonic, or more\r\ndifferentiated, species than those of the Lias?\r\n\r\nOr lastly, in what circumstance is the 'Phascolotherium' more\r\nembryonic, or of a more generalized type, than the modern Opossum; or a\r\n'Lophiodon', or a 'Paleotherium', than a modern 'Tapirus' or 'Hyrax'?\r\n\r\nThese examples might be almost indefinitely multiplied, but surely they\r\nare sufficient to prove that the only safe and unquestionable testimony\r\nwe can procure--positive evidence--fails to demonstrate any sort of\r\nprogressive modification towards a less embryonic, or less generalised,\r\ntype in a great many groups of animals of long-continued geological\r\nexistence. In these groups there is abundant evidence of variation--none\r\nof what is ordinarily understood as progression; and, if the known\r\ngeological record is to be regarded as even any considerable fragment\r\nof the whole, it is inconceivable that any theory of a necessarily\r\nprogressive development can stand, for the numerous orders and families\r\ncited afford no trace of such a process.\r\n\r\nBut it is a most remarkable fact, that, while the groups which have\r\nbeen mentioned, and many besides, exhibit no sign of progressive\r\nmodification, there are others, co-existing with them, under the same\r\nconditions, in which more or less distinct indications of such a process\r\nseems to be traceable. Among such indications I may remind you of the\r\npredominance of Holostome Gasteropoda in the older rocks as compared\r\nwith that of Siphonostome Gasteropoda in the later. A case less open\r\nto the objection of negative evidence, however, is that afforded by the\r\nTetrabranchiate Cephalopoda, the forms of the shells and of the septal\r\nsutures exhibiting a certain increase of complexity in the newer genera.\r\nHere, however, one is met at once with the occurrence of 'Orthoceras'\r\nand 'Baculites' at the two ends of the series, and of the fact that one\r\nof the simplest Genera, 'Nautilus', is that which now exists.\r\n\r\nThe Crinoidea, in the abundance of stalked forms in the ancient\r\nformations as compared with their present rarity, seem to present us\r\nwith a fair case of modification from a more embryonic towards a less\r\nembryonic condition. But then, on careful consideration of the facts,\r\nthe objection arises that the stalk, calyx, and arms of the paleozoic\r\nCrinoid are exceedingly different from the corresponding organs of a\r\nlarval 'Comatula'; and it might with perfect justice be argued that\r\n'Actinocrinus' and 'Eucalyptocrinus', for example, depart to the full\r\nas widely, in one direction, from the stalked embryo of 'Comatula', as\r\n'Comatula' itself does in the other.\r\n\r\nThe Echinidea, again, are frequently quoted as exhibiting a gradual\r\npassage from a more generalized to a more specialized type, seeing\r\nthat the elongated, or oval, Spatangoids appear after the spheroidal\r\nEchinoids. But here it might be argued, on the other hand, that the\r\nspheroidal Echinoids, in reality, depart further from the general plan\r\nand from the embryonic form than the elongated Spatangoids do; and that\r\nthe peculiar dental apparatus and the pedicellariae of the former are\r\nmarks of at least as great differentiation as the petaloid ambulacra and\r\nsemitae of the latter.\r\n\r\nOnce more, the prevalence of Macrurous before Brachyurous Podophthalmia\r\nis, apparently, a fair piece of evidence in favour of progressive\r\nmodification in the same order of Crustacea; and yet the case will not\r\nstand much sifting, seeing that the Macrurous Podophthalmia depart as\r\nfar in one direction from the common type of Podophthalmia, or from any\r\nembryonic condition of the Brachyura, as the Brachyura do in the\r\nother; and that the middle terms between Macrura and Brachyura--the\r\nAnomura--are little better represented in the older Mesozoic rocks than\r\nthe Brachyura are.\r\n\r\nNone of the cases of progressive modification which are cited from\r\namong the Invertebrata appear to me to have a foundation less open to\r\ncriticism than these; and if this be so, no careful reasoner would,\r\nI think, be inclined to lay very great stress upon them. Among the\r\nVertebrata, however, there are a few examples which appear to be far\r\nless open to objection.\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, true of several groups of Vertebrata which have lived\r\nthrough a considerable range of time, that the endoskeleton (more\r\nparticularly the spinal column) of the older genera presents a less\r\nossified, and, so far, less differentiated, condition than that of the\r\nyounger genera. Thus the Devonian Ganoids, though almost all members of\r\nthe same sub-order as 'Polypterus', and presenting numerous important\r\nresemblances to the existing genus, which possesses biconcave vertebrae,\r\nare, for the most part, wholly devoid of ossified vertebral centra. The\r\nMesozoic Lepidosteidae, again, have, at most, biconcave vertebrae, while\r\nthe existing 'Lepidosteus' has Salamandroid, opisthocoelous, vertebrae.\r\nSo, none of the Paleozoic Sharks have shown themselves to be possessed\r\nof ossified vertebrae, while the majority of modern Sharks possess\r\nsuch vertebrae. Again, the more ancient Crocodilia and Lacertilia\r\nhave vertebrae with the articular facets of their centra flattened\r\nor biconcave, while the modern members of the same group have them\r\nprocoelous. But the most remarkable examples of progressive modification\r\nof the vertebral column, in correspondence with geological age, are\r\nthose afforded by the Pycnodonts among fish, and the Labyrinthodonts\r\namong Amphibia.\r\n\r\nThe late able ichthyologist Heckel pointed out the fact, that, while\r\nthe Pycnodonts never possess true vertebral centra, they differ in the\r\ndegree of expansion and extension of the ends of the bony arches of\r\nthe vertebrae upon the sheath of the notochord; the Carboniferous forms\r\nexhibiting hardly any such expansion, while the Mesozoic genera present\r\na greater and greater development, until, in the Tertiary forms, the\r\nexpanded ends become suturally united so as to form a sort of false\r\nvertebra. Hermann von Meyer, again, to whose luminous researches we\r\nare indebted for our present large knowledge of the organization of the\r\nolder Labyrinthodonts, has proved that the Carboniferous 'Archegosaurus'\r\nhad very imperfectly developed vertebral centra, while the Triassic\r\n'Mastodonsaurus' had the same parts completely ossified. [7]\r\n\r\nThe regularity and evenness of the dentition of the 'Anoplotherium', as\r\ncontrasted with that of existing Artiodactyles, and the assumed nearer\r\napproach of the dentition of certain ancient Carnivores to the typical\r\narrangement, have also been cited as exemplifications of a law of\r\nprogressive development, but I know of no other cases based on positive\r\nevidence which are worthy of particular notice.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, does an impartial survey of the positively ascertained\r\ntruths of paleontology testify in relation to the common doctrines of\r\nprogressive modification, which suppose that modification to have taken\r\nplace by a necessary progress from more to less embryonic forms, or\r\nfrom more to less generalized types, within the limits of the period\r\nrepresented by the fossiliferous rocks?\r\n\r\nIt negatives those doctrines; for it either shows us no evidence of any\r\nsuch modification, or demonstrates it to have been very slight; and as\r\nto the nature of that modification, it yields no evidence whatsoever\r\nthat the earlier members of any long-continued group were more\r\ngeneralized in structure than the later ones. To a certain extent,\r\nindeed, it may be said that imperfect ossification of the vertebral\r\ncolumn is an embryonic character; but, on the other hand, it would be\r\nextremely incorrect to suppose that the vertebral columns of the older\r\nVertebrata are in any sense embryonic in their whole structure.\r\n\r\nObviously, if the earliest fossiliferous rocks now known are coeval\r\nwith the commencement of life, and if their contents give us any just\r\nconception of the nature and the extent of the earliest fauna and flora,\r\nthe insignificant amount of modification which can be demonstrated\r\nto have taken place in any one group of animals, or plants, is quite\r\nincompatible with the hypothesis that all living forms are the results\r\nof a necessary process of progressive development, entirely comprised\r\nwithin the time represented by the fossiliferous rocks.\r\n\r\nContrariwise, any admissible hypothesis of progressive modification must\r\nbe compatible with persistence without progression, through indefinite\r\nperiods. And should such an hypothesis eventually be proved to be true,\r\nin the only way in which it can be demonstrated, viz. by observation\r\nand experiment upon the existing forms of life, the conclusion will\r\ninevitably present itself, that the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cainozoic\r\nfaunae and florae, taken together, bear somewhat the same proportion to\r\nthe whole series of living beings which have occupied this globe, as the\r\nexisting fauna and flora do to them.\r\n\r\nSuch are the results of paleontology as they appear, and have for some\r\nyears appeared, to the mind of an inquirer who regards that study simply\r\nas one of the applications of the great biological sciences, and who\r\ndesires to see it placed upon the same sound basis as other branches of\r\nphysical inquiry. If the arguments which have been brought forward are\r\nvalid, probably no one, in view of the present state of opinion, will\r\nbe inclined to think the time wasted which has been spent upon their\r\nelaboration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Anniversary Address to the Geological Society for\r\n1862.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"le plus grand service qu'on puisse rendre a la science est\r\nd'y faire place nette avant d'y rien construire.\"--CUVIER]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Anniversary Address for 1851, 'Quart.
