This\r\nnew work I now offer as “A Manual of Gardening.” It is a combination\r\nand revision of the main parts of the other two books, together with\r\nmuch new material and the results of the experience of ten added years.\r\n\r\nA book of this kind cannot be drawn wholly from one’s own practice,\r\nunless it is designed to have a very restricted and local application.\r\nMany of the best suggestions in such a book will have come from\r\ncorrespondents, questioners, and those who enjoy talking about gardens;\r\nand my situation has been such that these communications have come to\r\nme freely. I have always tried, however, to test all such suggestions\r\nby experience and to make them my own before offering them to my\r\nreader. I must express my special obligation to those persons who\r\ncollaborated in the preparation of the other two books, and whose\r\ncontributions have been freely used in this one: to C.E. Hunn, a\r\ngardener of long experience; Professor Ernest Walker, reared as a\r\ncommercial florist; Professor L.R. Taft and Professor F.A. Waugh, well\r\nknown for their studies and writings in horticultural subjects.\r\n\r\nIn making this book, I have had constantly in mind the home-maker\r\nhimself or herself rather than the professional gardener. It is of the\r\ngreatest importance that we attach many persons to the land; and I am\r\nconvinced that an interest in gardening will naturally take the place\r\nof many desires that are much more difficult to gratify, and that lie\r\nbeyond the reach of the average man or woman.\r\n\r\nIt has been my good fortune to have seen amateur and commercial\r\ngardening in all parts of the United States, and I have tried to\r\nexpress something of this generality in the book; yet my experience, as\r\nwell as that of my original collaborators, is of the northeastern\r\nstates, and the book is therefore necessarily written from this region\r\nas a base. One gardening book cannot be made to apply in its practice\r\nin all parts of the United States and Canada unless its instructions\r\nare so general as to be practically useless; but the principles and\r\npoints of view may have wider application. While I have tried to give\r\nonly the soundest and most tested advice, I cannot hope to have escaped\r\nerrors and shortcomings, and I shall be grateful to my reader if he\r\nwill advise me of mistakes or faults that he may discover. I shall\r\nexpect to use such information in the making of subsequent editions.\r\n\r\nOf course an author cannot hold himself responsible for failures that\r\nhis reader may suffer. The statements in a book of this kind are in the\r\nnature of advice, and it may or it may not apply in particular\r\nconditions, and the success or failure is the result mostly of the\r\njudgment and carefulness of the operator. I hope that no reader of a\r\ngardening book will ever conceive the idea that reading a book and\r\nfollowing it literally will make him a gardener. He must always assume\r\nhis own risks, and this will be the first step in his personal\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nI should explain that the botanical nomenclature of this book is that\r\nof the “Cyclopedia of American Horticulture,” unless otherwise stated.\r\nThe exceptions are the “trade names,” or those used by nurserymen and\r\nseedsmen in the sale of their stock.\r\n\r\nI should further explain the reason for omitting ligatures and using\r\nsuch words as peony, spirea, dracena, cobea. As technical Latin\r\nformularies, the compounds must of course be retained, as in _Pæonia\r\nofficinalis_, _Spiræa Thunbergi_, _Dracæna fragrans_, _Cobœa scandens_;\r\nbut as Anglicized words of common speech it is time to follow the\r\ncustom of general literature, in which the combinations æ and œ have\r\ndisappeared. This simplification was begun in the “Cyclopedia of\r\nAmerican Horticulture” and has been continued in other writings.\r\n\r\nL. H. BAILEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nITHACA, NEW YORK,\r\nJanuary 20, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nTHE POINT OF VIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The open center. I. The open center.\r\n\r\nWherever there is soil, plants grow and produce their kind, and all\r\nplants are interesting; when a person makes a choice as to what plants\r\nhe shall grow in any given place, he becomes a gardener or a farmer;\r\nand if the conditions are such that he cannot make a choice, he may\r\nadopt the plants that grow there by nature, and by making the most of\r\nthem may still be a gardener or a farmer in some degree.\r\n\r\nEvery family, therefore, may have a garden. If there is not a foot of\r\nland, there are porches or windows. Wherever there is sunlight, plants\r\nmay be made to grow; and one plant in a tin-can may be a more helpful\r\nand inspiring garden to some mind than a whole acre of lawn and flowers\r\nmay be to another.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of a garden does not depend on the area, nor, happily,\r\non the cost or rarity of the plants. It depends on the temper of the\r\nperson. One must first seek to love plants and nature, and then to\r\ncultivate the happy peace of mind that is satisfied with little.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases a person will be happier if he has no\r\nrigid and arbitrary notions, for gardens are moodish, particularly with\r\nthe novice. If plants grow and thrive, he should be happy; and if the\r\nplants that thrive chance not to be the ones that he planted, they are\r\nplants nevertheless, and nature is satisfied with them.\r\n\r\nWe are wont to covet the things that we cannot have; but we are happier\r\nwhen we love the things that grow because they must. A patch of lusty\r\npigweeds, growing and crowding in luxuriant abandon, may be a better\r\nand more worthy object of affection than a bed of coleuses in which\r\nevery spark of life and spirit and individuality has been sheared out\r\nand suppressed. The man who worries morning and night about the\r\ndandelions in the lawn will find great relief in loving the dandelions.\r\nEach blossom is worth more than a gold coin, as it shines in the\r\nexuberant sunlight of the growing spring, and attracts the insects to\r\nits bosom. Little children like the dandelions: why may not we? Love\r\nthe things nearest at hand; and love intensely. If I were to write a\r\nmotto over the gate of a garden, I should choose the remark that\r\nSocrates is said to have made as he saw the luxuries in the market,\r\n“How much there is in the world that I do not want!”\r\n\r\nI verily believe that this paragraph I have just written is worth more\r\nthan all the advice with which I intend to cram the succeeding pages,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that I have most assiduously extracted this\r\nadvice from various worthy but, happily, long-forgotten authors.\r\nHappiness is a quality of a person, not of a plant or a garden; and the\r\nanticipation of joy in the writing of a book may be the reason why so\r\nmany books on garden-making have been written. Of course, all these\r\nbooks have been good and useful. It would be ungrateful, at the least,\r\nfor the present writer to say otherwise; but books grow old, and the\r\nadvice becomes too familiar. The sentences need to be transposed and\r\nthe order of the chapters varied, now and then, or interest lags. Or,\r\nto speak plainly, a new book of advice on handicraft is needed in every\r\ndecade, or perhaps oftener in these days of many publishers. There has\r\nbeen a long and worthy procession of these handbooks,—Gardiner &\r\nHepburn, M’Mahon, Cobbett—original, pungent, versatile\r\nCobbett!—Fessenden, Squibb, Bridgeman, Sayers, Buist, and a dozen more,\r\neach one a little richer because the others had been written. But even\r\nthe fact that all books pass into oblivion does not deter another hand\r\nfrom making still another venture.\r\n\r\nI expect, then, that every person who reads this book will make a\r\ngarden, or will try to make one; but if only tares grow where roses are\r\ndesired, I must remind the reader that at the outset I advised\r\npigweeds. The book, therefore, will suit everybody,—the experienced\r\ngardener, because it will be a repetition of what he already knows; and\r\nthe novice, because it will apply as well to a garden of burdocks as of\r\nonions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. The ornamental burdock]\r\n\r\n_What a garden is_.\r\n\r\nA garden is the personal part of an estate, the area that is most\r\nintimately associated with the private life of the home. Originally,\r\nthe garden was the area inside the inclosure or lines of fortification,\r\nin distinction from the unprotected area or fields that lay beyond; and\r\nthis latter area was the particular domain of agriculture. This book\r\nunderstands the garden to be that part of the personal or home premises\r\ndevoted to ornament, and to the growing of vegetables and fruits. The\r\ngarden, therefore, is an ill-defined demesne; but the reader must not\r\nmake the mistake of defining it by dimensions, for one may have a\r\ngarden in a flower-pot or on a thousand acres. In other words, this\r\nbook declares that every bit of land that is not used for buildings,\r\nwalks, drives, and fences, should be planted. What we shall\r\nplant—whether sward, lilacs, thistles, cabbages, pears, chrysanthemums,\r\nor tomatoes—we shall talk about as we proceed.\r\n\r\nThe only way to keep land perfectly unproductive is to keep it moving.\r\nThe moment the owner lets it alone, the planting has begun. In my own\r\ngarden, this first planting is of pigweeds. These may be followed, the\r\nnext year, by ragweeds, then by docks and thistles, with here and there\r\na start of clover and grass; and it all ends in June-grass and\r\ndandelions.\r\n\r\nNature does not allow the land to remain bare and idle. Even the banks\r\nwhere plaster and lath were dumped two or three years ago are now\r\nluxuriant with burdocks and sweet clover; and yet persons who pass\r\nthose dumps every day say that they can grow nothing in their own yard\r\nbecause the soil is so poor! Yet I venture that those same persons\r\nfurnish most of the pigweed seed that I use on my garden.\r\n\r\nThe lesson is that there is no soil—where a house would be built—so\r\npoor that something worth while cannot be grown on it. If burdocks will\r\ngrow, something else will grow; or if nothing else will grow, then I\r\nprefer burdocks to sand and rubbish.\r\n\r\nThe burdock is one of the most striking and decorative of plants, and a\r\ngood piece of it against a building or on a rough bank is just as\r\nuseful as many plants that cost money and are difficult to grow. I had\r\na good clump of burdock under my study window, and it was a great\r\ncomfort; but the man would persist in wanting to cut it down when he\r\nmowed the lawn. When I remonstrated, he declared that it was nothing\r\nbut burdock; but I insisted that, so far from being burdock, it was\r\nreally Lappa major, since which time the plant and its offspring have\r\nenjoyed his utmost respect. And I find that most of my friends reserve\r\ntheir appreciation of a plant until they have learned its name and its\r\nfamily connections.\r\n\r\nThe dump-place that I mentioned has a surface area of nearly one\r\nhundred and fifty square feet, and I find that it has grown over two\r\nhundred good plants of one kind or another this year. This is more than\r\nmy gardener accomplished on an equal area, with manure and water and a\r\nman to help. The difference was that the plants on the dump wanted to\r\ngrow, and the imported plants in the garden did not want to grow. It\r\nwas the difference between a willing horse and a balky horse. If a\r\nperson wants to show his skill, he may choose the balky plant; but if\r\nhe wants fun and comfort in gardening, he would better choose the\r\nwilling one.\r\n\r\nI have never been able to find out when the burdocks and mustard were\r\nplanted on the dump; and I am sure that they were never hoed or\r\nwatered. Nature practices a wonderfully rigid economy. For nearly half\r\nthe summer she even refused rain to the plants, but still they thrived;\r\nyet I staid home from a vacation one summer that I might keep my plants\r\nfrom dying. I have since learned that if the plants in my hardy borders\r\ncannot take care of themselves for a time, they are little comfort to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe joy of garden-making lies in the mental attitude and in the\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nTHE GENERAL PLAN OR THEORY OF THE PLACE\r\n\r\nHaving now discussed the most essential elements of gardening, we may\r\ngive attention to such minor features as the actual way in which a\r\nsatisfying garden is to be planned and executed.\r\n\r\nSpeaking broadly, a person will get from a garden what he puts into it;\r\nand it is of the first importance, therefore, that a clear conception\r\nof the work be formulated at the outset. I do not mean to say that the\r\ngarden will always turn out what it was desired that it should be; but\r\nthe failure to turn out properly is usually some fault in the first\r\nplan or some neglect in execution.\r\n\r\nSometimes the disappointment in an ornamental garden is a result of\r\nconfusion of ideas as to what a garden is for. One of my friends was\r\ngreatly disappointed on returning to his garden early in September to\r\nfind that it was not so full and floriferous as when he left it in\r\nJuly. He had not learned the simple lesson that even a flower-garden\r\nshould exhibit the natural progress of the season. If the garden begins\r\nto show ragged places and to decline in late August or early September,\r\nit is what occurs in all surrounding vegetation. The year is maturing.\r\nThe garden ought to express the feeling of the different months. The\r\nfailing leaves and expended plants are therefore to be looked on, to\r\nsome extent at least, as the natural order and destiny of a good\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nThese attributes are well exhibited in the vegetable-garden. In the\r\nspring, the vegetable-garden is a model of neatness and precision. The\r\nrows are straight. There are no missing plants. The earth is mellow and\r\nfresh. Weeds are absent. One takes his friends to the garden, and he\r\nmakes pictures of it. By late June or early July, the plants have begun\r\nto sprawl and to get out of shape. The bugs have taken some of them.\r\nThe rows are no longer trim and precise. The earth is hot and dry. The\r\nweeds are making headway. By August and September, the garden has lost\r\nits early regularity and freshness. The camera is put aside. The\r\nvisitors are not taken to it: the gardener prefers to go alone to find\r\nthe melon or the tomatoes, and he comes away as soon as he has secured\r\nhis product. Now, as a matter of fact, the garden has been going\r\nthrough its regular seasonal growth. It is natural that it become\r\nragged. It is not necessary that weeds conquer it; but I suspect that\r\nit would be a very poor garden, and certainly an uninteresting one, if\r\nit retained the dress of childhood at the time when it should develop\r\nthe personalities of age.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of outdoor gardening in which the progress of the\r\nseason is not definitely expressed,—in the carpet-bedding kind, and in\r\nthe subtropical kind. I hope that my reader will get a clear\r\ndistinction in these matters, for it is exceedingly important. The\r\ncarpet-bedding gardening is the making of figure-beds in house-leeks\r\nand achyranthes and coleus and sanitalia, and other things that can be\r\ngrown in compact masses and possibly sheared to keep them within place\r\nand bounds; the reader sees these beds in perfection in some of the\r\nparks and about florists’ establishments; he will understand at once\r\nthat they are not meant in any way to express the season, for the\r\ndifference between them in September and June is only that they may be\r\nmore perfect in September. The subtropical gardening (plates IV and V)\r\nis the planting out of house-grown stuff, in order to produce given\r\neffects, of such plants as palms, dracenas, crotons, caladiums,\r\npapyrus, together with such luxuriant things as dahlias and cannas and\r\nlarge ornamental grasses and castor beans; these plants are to produce\r\neffects quite foreign to the expression of a northern landscape, and\r\nthey are usually at their best and are most luxuriant when overtaken by\r\nthe fall frosts.\r\n\r\nNow, the home gardener usually relies on plants that more or less come\r\nand go with the seasons. He pieces out and extends the season, to be\r\nsure; but a garden with pansies, pinks, sweet william, roses, sweet\r\npeas, petunias, marigolds, salpiglossis, sweet sultan, poppies,\r\nzinnias, asters, cosmos, and the rest, is a progress-of-the-season\r\ngarden, nevertheless; and if it is a garden of herbaceous perennials,\r\nit still more completely expresses the time-of-year.\r\n\r\nMy reader will now consider, perhaps, whether he would have his garden\r\naccent and heighten his natural year from spring to fall, or whether he\r\ndesires to thrust into his year a feeling of another order of\r\nvegetation. Either is allowable; but the gardener should distinguish at\r\nthe outset.\r\n\r\nI wish to suggest to my reader, also, that it is possible for the\r\ngarden to retain some interest even in the winter months. I sometimes\r\nquestion whether it is altogether wise to clear out the old garden\r\nstems too completely and too smoothly in the fall, and thereby\r\nobliterate every mark of it for the winter months; but however this may\r\nbe, there are two ways by which the garden year may be extended: by\r\nplanting things that bloom very late in fall and others that bloom very\r\nearly in spring; by using freely, in the backgrounds, of bushes and\r\ntrees that have interesting winter characters.\r\n\r\n_The plan of the grounds_ (see Plate II).\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The plan of the place. II. The plan of the place. The arrangement\r\nof the property (which is in New York) is determined by an existing\r\nwoodland to the left or southeast of the house and a natural opening to\r\nthe southwest of the house. The house is colonial, and the entire\r\ntreatment is one of considerable simplicity. Wild or woodland gardens\r\nhave been developed to the right and left of the entrance, the latter\r\nor entrance lawns being left severely simple and plain in their\r\ntreatment. To the rear of the house a turf terrace raised three steps\r\nabove the general grade of the lawn leads to a general lawn terminated\r\nby a small garden exedra or teahouse with a fountain in its center, and\r\nto two shrub gardens forming interesting and closed pockets of lawn.\r\nThe stable and vegetable gardens are located to the south of the house\r\nin a natural opening in the woodland. The design is made by a\r\nprofessional landscape architect.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne cannot expect satisfaction in the planting and developing of a home\r\narea unless he has a clear conception of what is to be done. This\r\nnecessarily follows, since the pleasure that one derives from any\r\nenterprise depends chiefly on the definiteness of his ideals and his\r\nability to develop them. The homemaker should develop his plan before\r\nhe attempts to develop his place. He must study the various\r\nsubdivisions in order that the premises may meet all his needs. He\r\nshould determine the locations of the leading features of the place and\r\nthe relative importance to be given to the various parts of it,—as of\r\nthe landscape parts, the ornamental areas, the vegetable-garden, and\r\nthe fruit plantation.\r\n\r\nThe details of the planting may be determined in part as the place\r\ndevelops; it is only the structural features and purposes that need to\r\nbe determined beforehand in most small properties. The incidental\r\nmodifications that may be made in the planting from time to time keep\r\nthe interest alive and allow the planter to gratify his desire to\r\nexperiment with new plants and new methods.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that I am now speaking of ordinary home grounds\r\nwhich the home-maker desires to improve by himself. If the area is\r\nlarge enough to present distinct landscape features, it is always best\r\nto employ a landscape architect of recognized merit, in the same spirit\r\nthat one would employ an architect. The details, however, may even then\r\nbe filled in by the owner, if he is so inclined, following out the plan\r\nthat the landscape architect makes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Diagram of a back yard.]\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to have a definite plan on paper (drawn to scale) for\r\nthe location of the leading features of the place. These features are\r\nthe residence, the out-houses, the walks and drives, the service areas\r\n(as clothes yards), the border planting, flower-garden,\r\nvegetable-garden, and fruit-garden. It should not be expected that the\r\nmap plan can be followed in every detail, but it will serve as a\r\ngeneral guide; and if it is made on a large enough scale, the different\r\nkinds of plants can be located in their proper positions, and a record\r\nof the place be kept. It is nearly always unsatisfactory, for both\r\nowner and designer, if a plan of the place is made without a personal\r\ninspection of the area. Lines that look well on a map may not adjust\r\nthemselves readily to the varying contours of the place itself, and the\r\nlocation of the features inside the grounds will depend also in a very\r\nlarge measure on the objects that lie outside it. For example, all\r\ninteresting and bold views should be brought into the place, and all\r\nunsightly objects in the immediate vicinity should be planted out.\r\n\r\nA plan of a back yard of a narrow city lot is given in Fig. 2, showing\r\nthe heavy border planting of trees and shrubs, with the skirting border\r\nof flowers. In the front are two large trees, that are desired for\r\nshade. It will readily be seen from this plan how extensive the area\r\nfor flowers becomes when they are placed along such a devious border.\r\nMore color effect can be got from such an arrangement of the flowers\r\nthan could be secured if the whole area were planted to flower-beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Plan of a rough area.]\r\n\r\nA contour map plan of a very rough piece of ground is shown in Fig. 3.\r\nThe sides of the place are high, and it becomes necessary to carry a\r\nwalk through the middle area; and on either side of the front, it\r\nskirts the banks. Such a plan is usually unsightly on paper, but may\r\nnevertheless fit special cases very well. The plan is inserted here for\r\nthe purpose of illustrating the fact that a plan that will work on the\r\nground does not necessarily work on a map.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Suggestion for a school-ground on a\r\nfour-corners.]\r\n\r\nIn charting a place, it is important to locate the points from which\r\nthe walks are to start, and at which they are to emerge from the\r\ngrounds. These two points are then joined by direct and simple curves;\r\nand alongside the walks, especially in angles or bold curves, planting\r\nmay be inserted.\r\n\r\nA suggestion for school premises on a four-corners, and which the\r\npupils enter from three directions, is made in Fig. 4. The two\r\nplaygrounds are separated by a broken group of bushes extending from\r\nthe building to the rear boundary; but, in general, the spaces are kept\r\nopen, and the heavy border-masses clothe the place and make it\r\nhome-like. The lineal extent of the group margins is astonishingly\r\nlarge, and along all these margins flowers may be planted, if desired.\r\n\r\nIf there is only six feet between a schoolhouse and the fence, there is\r\nstill room for a border of shrubs. This border should be between the\r\nwalk and the fence,—on the very boundary,—not between the walk and the\r\nbuilding, for in the latter case the planting divides the premises and\r\nweakens the effect. A space two feet wide will allow of an irregular\r\nwall of bushes, if tall buildings do not cut out the light; and if the\r\narea is one hundred feet long, thirty to fifty kinds of shrubs and\r\nflowers can be grown to perfection, and the school-grounds will be\r\npractically no smaller for the plantation.\r\n\r\nOne cannot make a plan of a place until he knows what he wants to do\r\nwith the property; and therefore we may devote the remainder of this\r\nchapter to developing the idea in the layout of the premises rather\r\nthan to the details of map-making and planting.\r\n\r\nBecause I speak of the free treatment of garden spaces in this book it\r\nmust not be inferred that any reflection is intended on the “formal”\r\ngarden. There are many places in which the formal or “architect’s\r\ngarden” is much to be desired; but each of these cases should be\r\ntreated wholly by itself and be made a part of the architectural\r\nsetting of the place. These questions are outside the sphere of this\r\nbook. All formal gardens are properly individual studies.\r\n\r\nAll very special types of garden design are naturally excluded from a\r\nbook of this kind, such types, for example, as Japanese gardening.\r\nPersons who desire to develop these specialties will secure the\r\nservices of persons who are skilled in them; and there are also books\r\nand magazine articles to which they may go.\r\n\r\n_The picture in the landscape_.\r\n\r\nThe deficiency in most home grounds is not so much that there is too\r\nlittle planting of trees and shrubs as that this planting is\r\nmeaningless. Every yard should be a picture. That is, the area should\r\nbe set off from other areas, and it should have such a character that\r\nthe observer catches its entire effect and purpose without stopping to\r\nanalyze its parts. The yard should be one thing, one area, with every\r\nfeature contributing its part to one strong and homogeneous effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 5. The common or nursery way of planting]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. The proper or pictorial type of planting]\r\n\r\nThese remarks will become concrete if the reader turns his eye to Figs.\r\n5 and 6. The former represents a common type of planting of front\r\nyards. The bushes and trees are scattered promiscuously over the area.\r\nSuch a yard has no purpose, no central idea. It shows plainly that the\r\nplanter had no constructive conception, no grasp of any design, and no\r\nappreciation of the fundamental elements of the beauty of landscape.\r\nIts only merit is the fact that trees and shrubs have been planted; and\r\nthis, to most minds, comprises the essence and sum of the ornamentation\r\nof grounds. Every tree and bush is an individual alone, unattended,\r\ndisconnected from its environments, and, therefore, meaningless. Such a\r\nyard is only a nursery.\r\n\r\nThe other plan (Fig. 6) is a picture. The eye catches its meaning at\r\nonce. The central idea is the residence, with a free and open\r\ngreensward in front of it The same trees and bushes that were scattered\r\nhaphazard over Fig. 5 are massed into a framework to give effectiveness\r\nto the picture of home and comfort. This style of planting makes a\r\nlandscape, even though the area be no larger than a parlor. The other\r\nstyle is only a collection of curious plants. The one has an instant\r\nand abiding pictorial effect, which is restful and satisfying: the\r\nobserver exclaims, “What a beautiful home this is!” The other piques\r\none’s curiosity, obscures the residence, divides and distracts the\r\nattention: the observer exclaims, “What excellent lilac bushes are\r\nthese!”\r\n\r\nAn inquiry into the causes of the unlike impressions that one receives\r\nfrom a given landscape and from a painting of it explains the subject\r\nadmirably. One reason why the picture appeals to us more than the\r\nlandscape is because the picture is condensed, and the mind becomes\r\nacquainted with its entire purpose at once, while the landscape is so\r\nbroad that the individual objects at first fix the attention, and it is\r\nonly by a process of synthesis that the unity of the landscape finally\r\nbecomes apparent. This is admirably illustrated in photographs. One of\r\nthe first surprises that the novice experiences in the use of the\r\ncamera is the discovery that very tame scenes become interesting and\r\noften even spirited in the photograph. But there is something more than\r\nmere condensation in this vitalizing and beautifying effect of the\r\nphotograph or the painting: individual objects are so much reduced that\r\nthey no longer appeal to us as distinct subjects, and however uncouth\r\nthey may be in the reality, they make no impression in the picture; the\r\nthin and sere sward may appear rather like a closely shaven lawn or a\r\nnew-mown meadow. And again, the picture sets a limit to the scene; it\r\nframes it, and thereby cuts off all extraneous and confusing or\r\nirrelevant landscapes.\r\n\r\nThese remarks are illustrated in the aesthetics of landscape gardening.\r\nIt is the artist’s one desire to make pictures in the landscape. This\r\nis done in two ways: by the form of plantations, and by the use of\r\nvistas. He will throw his plantations into such positions that open and\r\nyet more or less confined areas of greensward are presented to the\r\nobserver at various points. This picture-like opening is nearly or\r\nquite devoid of small or individual objects, which usually destroy the\r\nunity of such areas and are meaningless in themselves. A vista is a\r\nnarrow opening or view between plantations to a distant landscape. It\r\ncuts up the broad horizon into portions that are readily cognizable. It\r\nframes parts of the country-side. The verdurous sides of the planting\r\nare the sides of the frame; the foreground is the bottom, and the sky\r\nis the top. It is of the utmost importance that good views be left or\r\nsecured from the best windows of the house (not forgetting the kitchen\r\nwindow); in fact, the placing of the house may often be determined by\r\nthe views that may be appropriated.\r\n\r\nIf a landscape is a picture, it must have a canvas. This canvas is the\r\ngreensward. Upon this, the artist paints with tree and bush and flower\r\nas the painter does upon his canvas with brush and pigments. The\r\nopportunity for artistic composition and design is nowhere so great as\r\nin the landscape garden, because no other art has such a limitless\r\nfield for the expression of its emotions. It is not strange, if this be\r\ntrue, that there have been few great landscape gardeners, and that,\r\nfalling short of art, the landscape gardener too often works in the\r\nsphere of the artisan. There can be no rules for landscape gardening,\r\nany more than there can be for painting or sculpture. The operator may\r\nbe taught how to hold the brush or strike the chisel or plant the tree,\r\nbut he remains an operator; the art is intellectual and emotional and\r\nwill not confine itself in precepts.\r\n\r\nThe making of a good and spacious lawn, then, is the very first\r\npractical consideration in a landscape garden.\r\n\r\nThe lawn provided, the gardener conceives what is the dominant and\r\ncentral feature in the place, and then throws the entire premises into\r\nsubordination to this feature. In home grounds this central feature is\r\nthe house. To scatter trees and bushes over the area defeats the\r\nfundamental purpose of the place,—the purpose to make every part of the\r\ngrounds lead up to the home and to accentuate its homelikeness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. A house]\r\n\r\nA house must have a background if it is to become a home. A house that\r\nstands on a bare plain or hill is a part of the universe, not a part of\r\na home. Recall the cozy little farm-house that is backed by a wood or\r\nan orchard; then compare some pretentious structure that stands apart\r\nfrom all planting. Yet how many are the farm-houses that stand as stark\r\nand cold against the sky as if they were competing with the moon! We\r\nwould not believe it possible for a man to live in a house twenty-five\r\nyears and not, by accident, allow some tree to grow, were it not that\r\nit is so!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8 A home]\r\n\r\nOf course these remarks about the lawn are meant for those countries\r\nwhere greensward is the natural ground cover. In the South and in arid\r\ncountries, greensward is not the prevailing feature of the landscape,\r\nand in these regions the landscape design may take on a wholly\r\ndifferent character, if the work is to be nature-like. We have not yet\r\ndeveloped other conceptions of landscape work to any perfect extent,\r\nand we inject the English greensward treatment even into deserts. We\r\nmay look for the time when a brown landscape garden may be made in a\r\nbrown country, and it may be good art not to attempt a broad open\r\ncenter in regions in which undergrowth rather than sod is the natural\r\nground cover. In parts of the United States we are developing a good\r\nSpanish-American architecture, perhaps we may develop a recognized\r\ncomparable landscape treatment as an artistic expression.\r\n\r\n_Birds; and cats_\r\n\r\nThe picture in the landscape is not complete without birds, and the\r\nbirds should comprise more species than English sparrows. If one is to\r\nhave birds on his premises, he must (1) attract them and (2) protect\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOne attracts birds by providing places in which they may nest. The free\r\nborder plantings have distinct advantages in attracting chipping\r\nsparrows, catbirds, and other species. The bluebirds, house wrens, and\r\nmartins may be attracted by boxes in which they can build.\r\n\r\nOne may attract birds by feeding them and supplying water. Suet for\r\nwoodpeckers and others, grain and crumbs for other kinds, and taking\r\ncare not to frighten or molest them, will soon win the confidence of\r\nthe birds. A slowly running or dripping fountain, with a good rim on\r\nwhich they may perch, will also attract them, and it is no mean\r\nenjoyment to watch the birds at bathing. Or, if one does not care to go\r\nto the expense of a bird fountain, he may supply their wants by means\r\nof a shallow dish of water set on the lawn.\r\n\r\nThe birds will need protection from cats. There is no more reason why\r\ncats should roam at will and uncontrolled than that dogs or horses or\r\npoultry should be allowed unlimited license. A cat away from home is a\r\ntrespasser and should be so treated. A person has no more right to\r\ninflict a cat on a neighborhood than to inflict a goat or rabbits or\r\nany other nuisance. All persons who keep cats should feel the same\r\nresponsibility for them that they feel for other property; and they\r\nshould be willing to forfeit their property right when they forfeit\r\ntheir control. The cats not only destroy birds, but they break the\r\npeace. The caterwauling at night will not be permitted in well-governed\r\ncommunities any more than the shooting of fire-arms or vicious talking\r\nwill be allowed: all night-roaming cats should be gathered in, just as\r\nstray dogs and tramps are provided for.\r\n\r\nI do not dislike cats, but I desire to see them kept at home and within\r\ncontrol. If persons say that they cannot keep them on their own\r\npremises, then these persons should not be allowed to have them. A bell\r\non the cat will prevent it from capturing old birds, and this may\r\nanswer a good purpose late in the season; but it will not stop the\r\nrobbing of nests or the taking of young birds, and here is where the\r\ngreatest havoc is wrought.\r\n\r\nIt is often asserted that cats must roam in order that rats and mice\r\nmay be reduced; but probably few house mice and few rats are got by\r\nwandering cats; and, again, many cats are not mousers. There are other\r\nways of controlling rats and mice; or if cats are employed for this\r\npurpose, see that they are restricted to the places where the house\r\nrats and mice are to be found.\r\n\r\nMany persons like squirrels about the place, but they cannot expect to\r\nhave both birds and squirrels unless very special precautions are\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThe English or house sparrow drives away the native birds, although he\r\nis himself an attractive inhabitant in winter, particularly where\r\nnative birds are not resident. The English sparrow should be kept in\r\nreduced numbers. This can be easily accomplished by poisoning them in\r\nwinter (when other birds are not endangered) with wheat soaked in\r\nstrychnine water. The contents of one of the eighth-ounce vials of\r\nstrychnine that may be secured at a drug store is added to sufficient\r\nwater to cover a quart of wheat. Let the wheat stand in the poison\r\nwater twenty-four to forty-eight hours (but not long enough for the\r\ngrains to sprout), then dry the wheat thoroughly. It cannot be\r\ndistinguished from ordinary wheat, and sparrows usually eat it freely,\r\nparticularly if they are in the habit of eating scattered grain and\r\ncrumbs. Of course, the greatest caution must be exercised that in the\r\nuse of such highly poisonous materials, accidents do not occur with\r\nother animals or with human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Open center treatment in a semi-tropical country. III. Open center\r\ntreatment in a semi-tropical country.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: The nursery or single-specimen type of planting in a\r\nfront yard\r\n\r\n_The planting is part of the design or picture._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10 A native fence-row] [Ilustration: Fig. 11 Birds\r\nbuild their nests here]\r\n\r\nIf the reader catches the full meaning of these pages, he has acquired\r\nsome of the primary conceptions in landscape gardening. The suggestion\r\nwill grow upon him day by day; and if he is of an observing turn of\r\nmind, he will find that this simple lesson will revolutionize his habit\r\nof thought respecting the planting of grounds and the beauty of\r\nlandscapes. He will see that a bush or flower-bed that is no part of\r\nany general purpose or design—that is, which does not contribute to the\r\nmaking of a picture—might better never have been planted. For myself, I\r\nwould rather have a bare and open pasture than such a yard as that\r\nshown in Fig. 9, even though it contained the choicest plants of every\r\nland. The pasture would at least be plain and restful and\r\nunpretentious; but the yard would be full of effort and fidget.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. A free-and-easy planting of things wild and\r\ntame.]\r\n\r\nReduced to a single expression, all this means that the greatest\r\nartistic value in planting lies in the effect of the mass, and not in\r\nthe individual plant. A mass has the greater value because it presents\r\na much greater range and variety of forms, colors, shades, and\r\ntextures, because it has sufficient extent or dimensions to add\r\nstructural character to a place, and because its features are so\r\ncontinuous and so well blended that the mind is not distracted by\r\nincidental and irrelevant ideas. Two pictures will illustrate all this.\r\nFigures 10, 11 are pictures of natural copses. The former stretches\r\nalong a field and makes a lawn of a bit of meadow which lies in front\r\nof it. The landscape has become so small and so well defined by this\r\nbank of verdure that it has a familiar and personal feeling. The great,\r\nbare, open meadows are too ill-defined and too extended to give any\r\ndomestic feeling; but here is a part of the meadow set off into an area\r\nthat one can compass with his affections.\r\n\r\nThese masses in Figs. 10, 11, and 12 have their own intrinsic merits,\r\nas well as their office in defining a bit of nature. One is attracted\r\nby the freedom of arrangement, the irregularity of sky-line, the bold\r\nbays and promontories, and the infinite play of light and shade. The\r\nobserver is interested in each because it has character, or features,\r\nthat no other mass in all the world possesses. He knows that the birds\r\nbuild their nests in the tangle and the rabbits find it a covert.\r\n\r\nNow let the reader turn to Fig. 9, which is a picture of an “improved”\r\ncity yard. Here there is no structural outline to the planting, no\r\ndefining of the area, no continuous flow of the form and color. Every\r\nbush is what every other one is or may be, and there are hundreds like\r\nthem in the same town. The birds shun them. Only the bugs find any\r\nhappiness in them. The place has no fundamental design or idea, no lawn\r\nupon which a picture may be constructed. This yard is like a sentence\r\nor a conversation in which every word is equally emphasized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. An open treatment of a school-ground. More\r\ntrees might be placed in the area, if desired.]\r\n\r\nIn bold contrast with this yard is the open-center treatment in Fig.\r\n13. Here there is pictorial effect; and there is opportunity along the\r\nborders to distribute trees and shrubs that may be desired as\r\nindividual specimens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. A rill much as nature made it.] [Illustration:\r\nFig. 15. A rill “improved,” so that it will not look “ragged” and\r\nunkempt.] The motive that shears the trees also razes the copse, in\r\norder that the gardener or “improver” may show his art. Compare Figs.\r\n14 and 15. Many persons seem to fear that they will never be known to\r\nthe world unless they expend a great amount of muscle or do something\r\nemphatic or spectacular; and their fears are usually well founded.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough that trees and bushes be planted in masses. They must\r\nbe kept in masses by letting them grow freely in a natural way. The\r\npruning-knife is the most inveterate enemy of shrubbery. Pictures 16\r\nand 17 illustrate what I mean. The former represents a good group of\r\nbushes so far as arrangement is concerned; but it has been ruined by\r\nthe shears. The attention of the observer is instantly arrested by the\r\nindividual bushes. Instead of one free and expressive object, there are\r\nseveral stiff and expressionless ones. If the observer stops to\r\nconsider his own thoughts when he comes upon such a collection, he will\r\nlikely find himself counting the bushes; or, at least, he will be\r\nmaking mental comparisons of the various bushes, and wondering why they\r\nare not all sheared to be exactly alike. Figure 17 shows how the same\r\n“artist” has treated two deutzias and a juniper. Much the same effect\r\ncould have been secured, and with much less trouble, by laying two\r\nflour barrels end to end and standing a third one between them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16. The making of a good group, but spoiled by the\r\npruning shears.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 17. The three guardsmen.] [Illustration: Fig. 18 A bit\r\nof semi-rustic work built into a native growth] I must hasten to say\r\nthat I have not the slightest objection to the shearing of trees. The\r\nonly trouble is in calling the practice art and in putting the trees\r\nwhere people must see them (unless they are part of a recognized\r\nformal-garden design). If the operator simply calls the business\r\nshearing, and puts the things where he and others who like them may see\r\nthem, objection could not be raised. Some persons like painted stones,\r\nothers iron bulldogs in the front yard and the word “welcome” worked\r\ninto the door-mat, and others like barbered trees. So long as these\r\nlikes are purely personal, it would seem to be better taste to put such\r\ncuriosities in the back yard, where the owner may admire them without\r\nmolestation\r\n\r\nThere is a persistent desire among workmen to shear and to trim: it\r\ndisplays their industry. It is a great thing to be able to allow the\r\nfreedom of nature to remain. The artist often builds his structures\r\ninto a native planting (as in Fig. 18) rather than to trust himself to\r\nproduce a good result by planting on razed surfaces.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion, I have tried to enforce the importance of the open\r\ncenter in non-formal home grounds in greensward regions. Of course this\r\ndoes not mean that there may not be central planting in particular\r\ncases where the conditions distinctly call for it nor that there may\r\nnot be trees on the lawn. If one has the placing of the trees, he may\r\nsee that they are not scattered aimlessly; but if good trees are\r\nalready growing on the place, it would be folly to think of removing\r\nthem merely because they are not in the best ideal positions; in such\r\ncase, it may be very necessary to adapt the treatment of the area to\r\nthe trees. The home-maker should always consider, also, the planting of\r\na few trees in such places as to shade and protect the residence: the\r\nmore closely they can be made a part of the general design or handling\r\nof the place, the better the results will be.\r\n\r\n_The flower-growing should be part of the design._\r\n\r\nI do not mean to discourage the use of brilliant flowers and bright\r\nfoliage and striking forms of vegetation; but these things are never\r\nprimary considerations in a good domain. The structural elements of the\r\nplace are designed first. The flanking and bordering masses are then\r\nplanted. Finally the flowers and accessories are put in, as a house is\r\npainted after it is built. Flowers appear to best advantage when seen\r\nagainst a background of foliage, and they are then, also, an integral\r\npart of the picture. The flower-garden, as such, should be at the rear\r\nor side of a place, as all other personal appurtenances are; but\r\nflowers and bright leaves may be freely scattered along the borders and\r\nnear the foliage masses.\r\n\r\nIt is a common saying that many persons have no love or appreciation of\r\nflowers, but it is probably nearer to the truth to say that no person\r\nis wholly lacking in this respect. Even those persons who declare that\r\nthey care nothing for flowers are generally deceived by their dislike\r\nof flower-beds and the conventional methods of flower-growing. I know\r\nmany persons who stoutly deny any liking for flowers, but who,\r\nnevertheless, are rejoiced with the blossoming of the orchards and the\r\npurpling of the clover fields. The fault may not lie so much with the\r\npersons themselves as with the methods of growing and displaying the\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nDefects in flower-growing.\r\n\r\nThe greatest defect with our flower-growing is the stinginess of it. We\r\ngrow our flowers as if they were the choicest rarities, to be coddled\r\nin a hotbed or under a bell-jar, and then to be exhibited as single\r\nspecimens in some little pinched and ridiculous hole cut in the turf,\r\nor perched upon an ant-hill that some gardener has laboriously heaped\r\noh a lawn. Nature, on the other hand, grows many of her flowers in the\r\nmost luxurious abandon, and one can pick an armful without offense. She\r\ngrows her flowers in earnest, as a man grows a crop of corn. One can\r\nrevel in the color and the fragrance and be satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe next defect with our flower-growing is the flower-bed. Nature has\r\nno time to make flower-bed designs: she is busy growing flowers. And,\r\nthen, if she were given to flower-beds, the whole effect would be lost,\r\nfor she could no longer be luxurious and wanton, and if a flower were\r\npicked her whole scheme might be upset. Imagine a geranium-bed or a\r\ncoleus-bed, with its wonderful “design,” set out into a wood or in a\r\nfree and open landscape! Even the birds would laugh at it!\r\n\r\nWhat I want to say is that we should grow flowers freely when we make a\r\nflower-garden. We should have enough of them to make the effort worth\r\nthe while. I sympathize with the man who likes sunflowers. There are\r\nenough of them to be worth looking at. They fill the eye. Now show this\r\nman ten feet square of pinks or asters, or daisies, all growing free\r\nand easy and he will tell you that he likes them. All this has a\r\nparticular application to the farmer, who is often said to dislike\r\nflowers. He grows potatoes and buckwheat and weeds by the acre: two or\r\nthree unhappy pinks or geraniums are not enough to make an impression.\r\n\r\nLawn flower-beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19 Hole-in-the-ground gardening] The easiest way to\r\nspoil a good lawn is to put a flower-bed in it; and the most effective\r\nway in which to show off flowers to the least advantage is to plant\r\nthem in a bed in the greensward. Flowers need a background. We do not\r\nhang our pictures on fence-posts. If flowers are to be grown on a lawn,\r\nlet them be of the hardy kind, which can be naturalized in the sod and\r\nwhich grow freely in the tall unmown grass; or else perennials of such\r\nnature that they make attractive clumps by themselves. Lawns should be\r\nfree and generous, but the more they are cut up and worried with\r\ntrivial effects, the smaller and meaner they look.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 20. Worth paying admittance price to see!] But even if\r\nwe consider these lawn flower-beds wholly apart from their\r\nsurroundings, we must admit that they are at best unsatisfactory. It\r\ngenerally amounts to this, that we have four months of sparse and\r\ndowncast vegetation, one month of limp and frost-bitten plants, and\r\nseven months of bare earth (Fig 19) I am not now opposing the\r\ncarpet-beds which professional gardeners make in parks and other\r\nmuseums. I like museums, and some of the carpet-beds and set pieces are\r\n“fearfully and wonderfully made” (see Fig 20) I am directing my remarks\r\nto those humble home-made flower-beds that are so common in lawns of\r\ncountry and city homes alike. These beds are cut from the good fresh\r\nturf, often in the most fantastic designs, and are filled with such\r\nplants as the women of the place may be able to carry over in cellars\r\nor in the window. The plants themselves may look very well in pots, but\r\nwhen they are turned out of doors, they have a sorry time for a month\r\nadapting themselves to the sun and winds, and it is generally well on\r\ntowards midsummer before they begin to cover the earth. During all\r\nthese weeks they have demanded more time and labor than would have been\r\nneeded to care for a plantation of much greater size and which would\r\nhave given flowers every day from the time the birds began to nest in\r\nthe spring until the last robin had flown in November.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21 An artist’s flower border]\r\n\r\nFlower-borders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 22. Petunias against a background of osiers.]\r\n[Illustration: 23. A sowing of flowers along a marginal planting.] We\r\nshould acquire the habit of speaking of the flower-border. The border\r\nplanting of which we have spoken sets bounds to the place, and makes it\r\none’s own. The person lives inside his place, not on it. Along these\r\nborders, against groups, often by the corners of the residence or in\r\nfront of porches—these are places for flowers. Ten flowers against a\r\nbackground are more effective than a hundred in the open yard.\r\n\r\nI have asked a professional artist, Mr Mathews, to draw me the kind of\r\na flower-bed that he likes. It is shown in Fig. 21. It is a border,—a\r\nstrip of land two or three feet wide along a fence. This is the place\r\nwhere pigweeds usually grow. Here he has planted marigolds, gladiolus,\r\ngolden rod, wild asters, China asters, and—best of all—hollyhocks. Any\r\none would like that flower-garden It has some of that local and\r\nindefinable charm that always attaches to an “old-fashioned garden”\r\nwith its medley of form and color Nearly every yard has some such strip\r\nof land along a rear walk or fence or against a building It is the\r\neasiest thing to plant it,—ever so much easier than digging the\r\ncharacterless geranium bed into the center of an inoffensive lawn. The\r\nsuggestions are carried further in 22 to 25.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. An open back yard. Flowers may be thrown in\r\nfreely along the borders, but they would spoil the lawn if placed in\r\nits center.] [Illustration: Fig. 25. A flower garden at the rear or one\r\nside of the place.]\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned garden.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the old-fashioned garden recalls one of William Falconer’s\r\nexcellent paragraphs (“Gardening,” November 15, 1897, p. 75): “We tried\r\nit in Schenley Park this year. We needed a handy dumping ground, and\r\nhit on the head of a deep ravine between two woods; into it we dumped\r\nhundreds upon hundreds of wagon loads of rock and clay, filling it near\r\nto the top, then surfaced it with good soil. Here we planted some\r\nshrubs, and broadcast among them set out scarlet poppies,\r\neschscholtzias, dwarf nasturtiums, snapdragons, pansies, marigolds, and\r\nall manner of hardy herbaceous plants, having enough of each sort to\r\nmake a mass of its kind and color, and the effect was fine. In the\r\nmiddle was a plantation of hundreds of clumps of Japan and German\r\nirises interplanted, thence succeeded by thousands of gladioli, and\r\nbanded with montbretias, from which we had flowers till frost. The\r\nsteep face of this hill was graded a little and a series of winding\r\nstone steps set into it, making the descent into the hollow quite easy;\r\nthe stones were the rough uneven slabs secured in blasting the rocks\r\nwhen grading in other parts of the park, and both along outer edges of\r\nthe steps and the sides of the upper walk a wide belt of moss pink was\r\nplanted; and the banks all about were planted with shrubs, vines, wild\r\nroses, columbines, and other plants. More cameras and kodaks were\r\nleveled by visitors at this piece of gardening than at any other spot\r\nin the park, and still we had acres of painted summer beds.”\r\n\r\nContents of the flower-borders.\r\n\r\nThere is no prescribed rule as to what one should put into these\r\ninformal flower-borders. Put in them the plants you like. Perhaps the\r\ngreater part of them should be perennials that come up of themselves\r\nevery spring, and that are hardy and reliable. Wild flowers are\r\nparticularly effective. Every one knows that many of the native herbs\r\nof woods and glades are more attractive than some of the most prized\r\ngarden flowers. The greater part of these native flowers grow readily\r\nin cultivation, sometimes even in places which, in soil and exposure,\r\nare much unlike their native haunts. Many of them make thickened roots,\r\nand they may be safely transplanted at any time after the flowers have\r\npassed. To most persons the wild flowers are less known than many\r\nexotics that have smaller merit, and the extension of cultivation is\r\nconstantly tending to annihilate them. Here, then, in the informal\r\nflower-border, is an opportunity to rescue them. Then one may sow in\r\nfreely of easy-growing annuals, as marigolds, China asters, petunias\r\nand phloxes, and sweet peas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 26. Making the most of a rock.] One of the advantages of\r\nthese borders lying at the boundary is that they are always ready to\r\nreceive more plants, unless they are full. That is, their symmetry is\r\nnot marred if some plants are pulled out and others are put in. And if\r\nthe weeds now and then get a start, very little harm is done. Such a\r\nborder half full of weeds is handsomer than the average\r\nhole-in-the-lawn geranium bed. An ample border may receive wild plants\r\nevery month in the year when the frost is out of the ground. Plants are\r\ndug in the woods or fields, whenever one is on an excursion, even if in\r\nJuly. The tops are cut off, the roots kept moist until they are placed\r\nin the border; most of these much-abused plants will grow. To be sure,\r\none will secure some weeds; but then, the weeds are a part of the\r\ncollection! Of course, some plants will resent this treatment, but the\r\nborder may be a happy family, and be all the better and more personal\r\nbecause it is the result of moments of relaxation. Such a border has\r\nsomething new and interesting every month of the growing season; and\r\neven in the winter the tall clumps of grasses and aster-stems hold\r\ntheir banners above the snow and are a source of delight to every\r\nfrolicsome bevy of snowbirds.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of a weedland to suggest how simple and easy a thing it\r\nis to make an attractive mass-plantation. One may make the most of a\r\nrock (Fig. 26) or bank, or other undesirable feature of the place. Dig\r\nup the ground and make it rich, and then set plants in it. You will not\r\nget it to suit you the first year, and perhaps not the second or the\r\nthird; you can always pull out plants and put more in. I should not\r\nwant a lawn-garden so perfect that I could not change it in some\r\ncharacter each year; I should lose interest in it.\r\n\r\nIt must not be understood that I am speaking only for mixed borders. On\r\nthe contrary, it is much better in most cases that each border or bed\r\nbe dominated by the expression of one kind of flower or bush. In one\r\nplace a person may desire a wild aster effect, or a petunia effect, or\r\na larkspur effect, or a rhododendron effect; or it may be desirable to\r\nrun heavily to strong foliage effects in one direction and to light\r\nflower effects in another. The mixed border is rather more a\r\nflower-garden idea than a landscape idea; when it shall be desirable to\r\nemphasize the one and when the other, cannot be set down in a book.\r\n\r\n_The value of plants may lie in foliage and form rather than in bloom._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 27. The plant-form in a perennial salvia.] What kinds of\r\nshrubs and flowers to plant is a wholly secondary and largely a\r\npersonal consideration. The main plantings are made up of hardy and\r\nvigorous species; then the things that you like are added. There is\r\nendless choice in the species, but the arrangement or disposition of\r\nthe plants is far more important than the kinds; and the foliage and\r\nform of the plant are usually of more importance than its bloom.\r\n\r\nThe appreciation of foliage effects in the landscape is a higher type\r\nof feeling than the desire for mere color. Flowers are transitory, but\r\nfoliage and plant forms are abiding. The common roses have very little\r\nvalue for landscape planting because the foliage and habit of the\r\nrose-bush are not attractive, the leaves are inveterately attacked by\r\nbugs, and the blossoms are fleeting. Some of the wild roses and the\r\nJapanese _Rosa rugosa_, however, have distinct merit for mass effects.\r\n\r\nEven the common flowers, as marigold, zinnias, and gaillardias, are\r\ninteresting as plant forms long before they come into bloom. To many\r\npersons the most satisfying epoch in the garden is that preceding the\r\nbloom, for the habits and stature of the plants are then unobscured.\r\nThe early stages of lilies, daffodils, and all perennials are most\r\ninteresting; and one never appreciates a garden until he realizes that\r\nthis is so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 28. Funkia, or day-lily. Where lies the chief\r\ninterest,--in the plant-form or in the bloom?] [Illustration: 29. A\r\nlarge-leaved nicotiana.] Now let the reader, with these suggestions in\r\nmind, observe for one week the plant-forms in the humble herbs that he\r\nmeets, whether these herbs are strong garden plants or the striking\r\nsculpturing of mulleins, burdocks, and jimson-weed. Figures 27 to 31\r\nwill be suggestive.\r\n\r\nWild bushes are nearly always attractive in form and habit when planted\r\nin borders and groups. They improve in appearance under cultivation\r\nbecause they are given a better chance to grow. In wild nature there is\r\nsuch fierce struggle for existence that plants usually grow to few or\r\nsingle stems, and they are sparse and scraggly in form; but once given\r\nall the room they want and a good soil, they become luxurious, full,\r\nand comely. In most home grounds in the country the body of the\r\nplanting may be very effectively composed of bushes taken from the\r\nadjacent woods and fields. The masses may then be enlivened by the\r\naddition here and there of cultivated bushes, and the planting of\r\nflowers and herbs about the borders. It is not essential that one know\r\nthe names of these wild bushes, although a knowledge of their botanical\r\nkinships will add greatly to the pleasure of growing them. Neither will\r\nthey look common when transferred to the lawn. There are not many\r\npersons who know even the commonest wild bushes intimately, and the\r\nthings change so much in looks when removed to rich ground that few\r\nhome-makers recognize them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 30. The awkward century plant that has been laboriously\r\ncarried over winter year by year in the cellar: compare with other\r\nplants here shown as to its value as a lawn subject.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Making a picture with rhubarb.]\r\n\r\nOdd and formal trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 32. A weeping tree at one side of the grounds and\r\nsupported by a background.] It is but a corollary of this discussion to\r\nsay that plants which are simply odd or grotesque or unusual should be\r\nused with the greatest caution, for they introduce extraneous and\r\njarring effects. They are little in sympathy with a landscape garden.\r\nAn artist would not care to paint an evergreen that is sheared into\r\nsome grotesque shape. It is only curious, and shows what a man with\r\nplenty of time and long pruning shears can accomplish. A weeping tree\r\n(particularly of a small-growing species) is usually seen to best\r\nadvantage when it stands against a group or mass of foliage (Fig. 32),\r\nas a promontory, adding zest and spirit to the border; it then has\r\nrelation with the place.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to speak of the planting of the Lombardy poplar, which\r\nmay be taken as a type of the formal tree, and as an illustration of\r\nwhat I mean to express. Its chief merits to the average planter are the\r\nquickness of its growth and the readiness with which it multiplies by\r\nsprouts. But in the North it is likely to be a short-lived tree, it\r\nsuffers from storms, and it has few really useful qualities. It may be\r\nused to some advantage in windbreaks for peach orchards and other\r\nshort-lived plantations; but after a few years a screen of Lombardies\r\nbegins to fail, and the habit of suckering from the root adds to its\r\nundesirable features. For shade it has little merit, and for timber\r\nnone. Persons like it because it is striking, and this, in an artistic\r\nsense, is its gravest fault. It is unlike anything else in our\r\nlandscape, and does not fit into our scenery well. A row of Lombardies\r\nalong a roadside is like a row of exclamation points!\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Subtropical bedding against a building. Caladiums, cannas,\r\nabutilons, permanent rhododendrons, and other large stuff, with\r\ntuberous begonias and balsams between. IV. Subtropical bedding against\r\na building. Caladiums, cannas, abutilons, permanent rhododendrons, and\r\nother large stuff, with tuberous begonias and balsams between.\r\n\r\nBut the Lombardy can often be used to good effect as one factor in a\r\ngroup of trees, where its spire-like shape, towering above the\r\nsurrounding foliage, may lend a spirited charm to the landscape. It\r\ncombines well in such groups if it stands in visual nearness to\r\nchimneys or other tall formal objects. Then it gives a sort of\r\narchitectural finish and spirit to a group; but the effect is generally\r\nlessened, if not altogether spoiled, in small places, if more than one\r\nLombardy is in view. One or two specimens may often be used to give\r\nvigor to heavy plantations about low buildings, and the effect is\r\ngenerally best if they are seen beyond or at the rear of the building.\r\nNote the use that the artist has made of them in the backgrounds in\r\nFigs. 12, 13, and 43.\r\n\r\nPoplars and the like.\r\n\r\nAnother defect in common ornamental planting, which is well illustrated\r\nin the use of poplars, is the desire for plants merely because they\r\ngrow rapidly. A very rapid-growing tree nearly always produces cheap\r\neffects. This is well illustrated in the common planting of willows and\r\npoplars about summer places or lake shores. Their effect is almost\r\nwholly one of thinness and temporariness. There is little that suggests\r\nstrength or durability in willows and poplars, and for this reason they\r\nshould usually be employed as minor or secondary features in ornamental\r\nor home grounds. When quick results are desired, nothing is better to\r\nplant than these trees; but better trees, as maples, oaks, or elms,\r\nshould be planted with them, and the poplars and willows should be\r\nremoved as rapidly as the other species begin to afford protection.\r\nWhen the plantation finally assumes its permanent characters, a few of\r\nthe remaining poplars and willows, judiciously left, may afford very\r\nexcellent effects; but no one who has an artist’s feeling would be\r\ncontent to construct the framework of his place of these rapid-growing\r\nand soft-wooded trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. A spring expression worth securing. Catkins of\r\nthe small poplar.] [Illustration: Fig. 34. Plant-form in\r\ncherries.--Reine Hortense.] I have said that the legitimate use of\r\npoplars in ornamental grounds is in the production of minor or\r\nsecondary effects. As a rule, they are less adapted to isolated\r\nplanting as specimen trees than to using in composition,—that is, as\r\nparts of general groups of trees, where their characters serve to break\r\nthe monotony of heavier forms and heavier foliage. The poplars are gay\r\ntrees, as a rule, especially those, like the aspens, that have a\r\ntrembling foliage. Their leaves are bright and the tree-tops are thin.\r\nThe common aspen or “popple,” _Populus tremuloides_, of our woods, is a\r\nmeritorious little tree for certain effects. Its dangling catkins (Fig.\r\n33), light, dancing foliage, and silver-gray limbs, are always\r\ncheering, and its autumn color is one of the purest golden-yellows of\r\nour landscape. It is good to see a tree of it standing out in front of\r\na group of maples or evergreens.\r\n\r\nPlant-forms.\r\n\r\nBefore one attains to great sensitiveness in the appreciation of\r\ngardens, he learns to distinguish plants by their forms. This is\r\nparticularly true for trees and shrubs. Each species has its own\r\n“expression,” which is determined by the size that is natural to it,\r\nmode of branching, form of top, twig characters, bark characters,\r\nfoliage characters, and to some extent its flower and fruit characters.\r\nIt is a useful practice for one to train his eye by learning the\r\ndifference in expression of the trees of different varieties of\r\ncherries or pears or apples or other fruits, if he has access to a\r\nplantation of them. The differences in cherries and pears are very\r\nmarked (Figs. 34-36). He may also contrast and compare carefully the\r\nkinds of any tree or shrub of which there are two or three species in\r\nthe neighborhood, learning to distinguish them without close\r\nexamination; as the sugar maple, red maple, soft maple, and Norway\r\nmaple (if it is planted); the white or American elm, the cork elm, the\r\nslippery elm, the planted European elms; the aspen, large-toothed\r\npoplar, cottonwood, balm of gilead, Carolina poplar, Lombardy poplar;\r\nthe main species of oaks; the hickories; and the like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. Morello cherry.] [Illustration: Fig. 36. May\r\nDuke cherry.] It will not be long before the observer learns that many\r\nof the tree and shrub characters are most marked in winter; and he will\r\nbegin unconsciously to add the winter to his year.\r\n\r\n_Various specific examples_.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks will mean more if the reader is shown some\r\nconcrete examples. I have chosen a few cases, not because they are the\r\nbest, or even because they are always good enough for models, but\r\nbecause they lie in my way and illustrate what I desire to teach.\r\n\r\nA front yard example.\r\n\r\nWe will first look at a very ordinary front yard. It contained no\r\nplants, except a pear tree standing near the corner of the house. Four\r\nyears later sees the yard as shown in Fig. 37. An exochorda is the\r\nlarge bush in the very foreground, and the porch foundation is screened\r\nand a border is thereby given to the lawn. The length of this planting\r\nfrom end to end is about fourteen feet, with a projection towards the\r\nfront on the left of ten feet. In the bay at the base of this\r\nprojection the planting is only two feet wide or deep, and from here it\r\ngradually swings out to the steps, eight feet wide. The prominent\r\nlarge-leaved plant near the steps is a bramble, _Rubus odoratus_, very\r\ncommon in the neighborhood, and it is a choice plant for decorative\r\nplanting, when it is kept under control. The plants in this border in\r\nfront of the porch are all from the wild, and comprise a prickly ash,\r\nseveral plants of two wild osiers or dogwoods, a spice bush, rose, wild\r\nsunflowers and asters and golden-rods. The promontory at the left is a\r\nmore ambitious but less effective mass. It contains an exochorda, a\r\nreed, variegated elder, sacaline, variegated dogwood, tansy, and a\r\nyoung tree of wild crab. At the rear of the plantation, next the house,\r\none sees the pear tree. The best single part of the planting is the\r\nreed (_Arundo Donax_) overtopping the exochorda. The photograph was\r\ntaken early in summer, before the reed had become conspicuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 37. The planting in a simple front yard.]\r\n\r\nA ground plan of this planting is shown in Fig. 38. At A is the walk\r\nand B the steps. An opening at D serves as a passage. The main\r\nplanting, in front of the porch, fourteen feet long, received twelve\r\nplants, some of which have now spread into large clumps. At 1 is a\r\nlarge bush of osier, _Cornus Baileyi_, one of the best red-stemmed\r\nbushes. At 2 is a mass of _Rubus odoratus_; at 5 asters and\r\ngolden-rods; at 3 a clump of wild sunflowers. The projecting planting\r\non the left comprises about ten plants, of which 4 is exochorda, 6 is\r\narundo or reed, at the back of which is a large clump of sacaline, and\r\n7 is a variegated-leaved elder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Plan of the planting shown in Fig. 37.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. Diagram of a back-yard planting. 50 x 90 feet.]\r\n\r\nAnother example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. The beginning of a landscape garden.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. The result in five years.]\r\n\r\nA back yard is shown in Fig. 39. The owner wanted a tennis court, and\r\nthe yard is so small as not to allow of wide planting at the borders.\r\nHowever, something could be done. On the left is a weedland border,\r\nwhich formed the basis of the discussion of wild plants on page 35. In\r\nthe first place, a good lawn was made. In the second place, no walks or\r\ndrives were laid in the area. The drive for grocers’ wagons and coal is\r\nseen in the rear, ninety feet from the house. From I to J is the\r\nweedland, separating the area from the neighbor’s premises. Near I is a\r\nclump of roses. At K is a large bunch of golden-rods. H marks a clump\r\nof yucca. G is a cabin, covered with vines on the front. From G to F is\r\nan irregular border, about six feet wide, containing barberries,\r\nforsythias, wild elder, and other bushes. D E is a screen of Russian\r\nmulberry, setting off the clothes yard from the front lawn. Near the\r\nback porch, at the end of the screen, is an arbor covered with wild\r\ngrapes, making a play-house for the children. A clump of lilacs stands\r\nat A. At B is a vine-covered screen, serving as a hammock support. The\r\nlawn made and the planting done, it was next necessary to lay the\r\nwalks. These are wholly informal affairs, made by sinking a plank ten\r\ninches wide into the ground to a level with the sod. The border\r\nplantings of this yard are too straight and regular for the most\r\nartistic results, but such was necessary in order not to encroach upon\r\nthe central space. Yet the reader will no doubt agree that this yard is\r\nmuch better than it could be made by any system of scattered and\r\nspotted planting. Let him imagine how a glowing carpet-bed would look\r\nset down in the center of this lawn!\r\n\r\nA third example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. A meaningless back-yard planting, and an\r\nunnecessary drive.] [Illustration: Fig. 43. Suggestions for improving\r\nFig. 42.]\r\n\r\nThe making of a landscape picture is well illustrated in Figs. 40, 41.\r\nThe former shows a small clay field (seventy-five feet wide, and three\r\nhundred feet deep), with a barn at the rear. In front of the barn is a\r\nscreen of willows. The observer is looking from the dwelling-house. The\r\narea has been plowed and seeded for a lawn. The operator has then\r\nmarked out a devious line upon either border with a hoe handle, and all\r\nthe space between these borders has been gone over with a garden roller\r\nto mark the area of the desired greensward.\r\n\r\nThe borders are now planted with a variety of small trees, bushes, and\r\nherbs. Five years later the view shown in Fig. 41 was taken.\r\n\r\nA small back yard.\r\n\r\nA back yard is shown in Fig. 42. It is approximately sixty feet square.\r\nAt present it contains a drive, which is unnecessary, expensive to keep\r\nin repair, and destructive of any attempt to make a picture of the\r\narea. The place could be improved by planting it somewhat after the\r\nmanner of Fig. 43.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. A subtropical bed.

Present outline of a city back yard, desired to\r\nbe planted.]\r\n\r\nA plan of a city lot is given in Fig. 44. The area is fifty by one\r\nhundred, and the house occupies the greater part of the width. It is\r\nlevel, but the surrounding land is higher, resulting in a sharp\r\nterrace, three or four feet high, on the rear, E D. This terrace\r\nvanishes at C on the right, but extends nearly the whole length of the\r\nother side, gradually diminishing as it approaches A. There is a\r\nterrace two feet high extending from A to B, along the front. Beyond\r\nthe line E D is the rear of an establishment which it is desired to\r\nhide. Since the terraces set definite borders to this little place, it\r\nis desirable to plant the boundaries rather heavily. If the adjoining\r\nlawns were on the same level, or if the neighbors would allow one area\r\nto be merged into the other by pleasant slopes, the three yards might\r\nbe made into one picture; but the place must remain isolated.\r\n\r\nThere are three problems of structural planting in the place: to\r\nprovide a cover or screen at the rear; to provide lower border masses\r\non the side terraces; to plant next the foundations of the house. Aside\r\nfrom these problems, the grower is entitled to have a certain number of\r\nspecimen plants, if he has particular liking for given types, but these\r\nspecimens must be planted in some relation to the structural masses,\r\nand not in the middle of the lawn.\r\n\r\nThe owner desired a mixed planting, for variety. The following shrubs\r\nwere actually selected and planted. The place is in central New York:—\r\n\r\n_Shrubs for the tall background_\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Barberry, _Berberis vulgaris_ and var. _purpurea_.\r\n\r\n1 Cornus Mas.\r\n\r\n2 Tall deutzias.\r\n\r\n3 Lilacs.\r\n\r\n2 Mock oranges, _Philadelphus grandiflorus_ and _P. coronarius_.\r\n\r\n2 Variegated elders.\r\n\r\n2 Eleagnus, _Elœagnus hortensis_ and _E. longipes_.\r\n\r\n1 Exochorda.\r\n\r\n2 Hibiscuses.\r\n\r\n Privet.\r\n\r\n3 Viburnums.\r\n\r\n1 Snowball.\r\n\r\n1 Tartarian honeysuckle.\r\n\r\n1 Silver Bell, _Halesia tetraptera_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45. The planting of the terrace in Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\nThese were planted on the sloping bank of the terrace, from E to D. The\r\nterrace has an incline, or width, of about three feet. Figure 45 shows\r\nthis terrace after the planting was completed, looking from the point\r\nC.\r\n\r\n_Shrubs of medium size, suitable for side plantings and groups in the\r\nforegoing example_\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Barberries, _Berberis Thunbergii_.\r\n\r\n3 Osier dogwoods, variegated.\r\n\r\n2 Japanese quinces, _Cydonia Japonica_ and _C. Maulei_.\r\n\r\n4 Tall deutzias.\r\n\r\n1 Variegated elder.\r\n\r\n7 Weigelas, assorted colors.\r\n\r\n1 Rhodotypos.\r\n\r\n9 Spireas of medium growth, assorted.\r\n\r\n1 Rubus odoratus.\r\n\r\n1 Lonicera fragrantissima.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46. Said to have been planted.]\r\n\r\nMost of these shrubs were planted in a border two feet wide, extending\r\nfrom B to C D, the planting beginning about ten feet back from the\r\nstreet. Some of them were placed on the terrace at the left, extending\r\nfrom E one-fourth of the distance to A. The plants were set about two\r\nfeet apart. A strong clump was placed at N to screen the back yard. In\r\nthis back yard a few small fruit trees and a strawberry bed were\r\nplanted.\r\n\r\n_Low informal shrubs for front of porch and banking against house_\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Deutzia gracilis.\r\n\r\n6 Kerrias, green and variegated.\r\n\r\n3 Daphne Mezereum.\r\n\r\n3 Lonicera Halliana.\r\n\r\n3 Rubus phœnicolasius.\r\n\r\n3 Symphoricarpus vulgaris.\r\n\r\n4 Mahonias.\r\n\r\n1 Ribes aureum.\r\n\r\n1 Ribes sanguineum.\r\n\r\n1 Rubus cratægifolius.\r\n\r\n1 Rubus fruticosus var. laciniatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47. An area well filled. Compare Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\nThese bushes were planted against the front of the house (a porch on a\r\nhigh foundation extends to the right from O), from the walk around to\r\nP, and a few of them were placed at the rear of the house.\r\n\r\n_Specimen shrubs for mere ornament, for this place_\r\n\r\n\r\nAzalea.\r\n\r\nRhododendron.\r\n\r\nRose.\r\n\r\n2 Hydrangeas.\r\n\r\n1 Snowball.\r\n\r\n1 each Forsythia suspensa and F. viridissima.\r\n\r\n2 Flowering almonds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were planted in conspicuous places here and there against the\r\nother masses.\r\n\r\nHere are one hundred excellent and interesting bushes planted in a yard\r\nonly fifty feet wide and one hundred feet deep, and yet the place has\r\nas much room in it as it had before. There is abundant opportunity\r\nalong the borders for dropping in cannas, dahlias, hollyhocks, asters,\r\ngeraniums, coleuses, and other brilliant plants. The bushes will soon\r\nbegin to crowd, to be sure, but a mass is wanted, and the narrowness of\r\nthe plantations will allow each bush to develop itself laterally to\r\nperfection. If the borders become too thick, however, it is an easy\r\nmatter to remove some of the bushes; but they probably will not.\r\nPicture the color and variety and life in that little yard. And if a\r\npigweed now and then gets a start in the border, it would do no harm to\r\nlet it alone: it belongs there! Then picture the same area filled with\r\ndisconnected, spotty, dyspeptic, and unspirited flower-beds and rose\r\nbushes!\r\n\r\nVarious examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48. The screening of the tennis-screen.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49. At the bottom of the clothes-post.]\r\n\r\nStrong and bare foundations should be relieved by heavy planting. Fill\r\nthe corners with snow-drifts of foliage. Plant with a free hand, as if\r\nyou meant it (compare Figs. 46 and 47). The corner by the steps is a\r\nperennial source of bad temper. The lawn-mower will not touch it, and\r\nthe grass has to be cut with a butcher-knife. If nothing else comes to\r\nhand, let a burdock grow in it (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe tennis-screen may be relieved by a background (Fig. 48), and a\r\nclump of ribbon-grass or something else is out of the way against a\r\npost (Fig. 49).\r\n\r\nExcellent mass effects may be secured by cutting well-established\r\nplants of sumac, ailanthus, basswood, and other strong-growing things,\r\nto the ground each year, for the purpose of securing the stout shoots.\r\nFigure 50 will give the hint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50. Young shoots of ailanthus (and sunflowers for\r\nvariety).]\r\n\r\nBut if one has no area which he can make into a lawn and upon which he\r\ncan plant such verdurous masses, what then may he do? Even then there\r\nmay be opportunity for a little neat and artistic planting. Even if one\r\nlives in a rented house, he may bring in a bush or an herb from the\r\nwoods, and paint a picture with it. Plant it in the corner by the\r\nsteps, in front of the porch, at the corner of the house,—almost\r\nanywhere except in the center of the lawn. Make the ground rich, secure\r\na strong root, and plant it with care; then wait. The little clump will\r\nnot only have a beauty and interest of its own, but it may add\r\nimmensely to the furniture of the yard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51. A backyard cabin.]\r\n\r\nAbout these clumps one may plant bulbs of glowing tulips or dainty\r\nsnowdrops and lilies-of-the-valley; and these may be followed with\r\npansies and phlox and other simple folk. Very soon one finds himself\r\ndeeply interested in these random and detached pictures, and almost\r\nbefore he is aware he finds that he has rounded off the corners of the\r\nhouse, made snug little arbors of wild grapes and clematis, covered the\r\nrear fence and the outhouse with actinidia and bitter-sweet, and has\r\nthrown in dashes of color with hollyhocks, cannas, and lilies, and has\r\ntied the foundations of the buildings to the greensward by low strands\r\nof vines or deft bits of planting. He soon comes to feel that flowers\r\nare most expressive of the best emotions when they are daintily dropped\r\nin here and there against a background of foliage, or else made a\r\nside-piece in the place. There is no limit to the adaptations; Figs. 51\r\nto 58 suggest some of the backyard possibilities.\r\n\r\nPresently he rebels at the bold, harsh, and impudent designs of some of\r\nthe gardeners, and grows into a resourceful love of plant forms and\r\nverdure. He may still like the weeping and cut-leaved and party-colored\r\ntrees of the horticulturist, but he sees that their best effects are to\r\nbe had when they are planted sparingly, as borders or promontories of\r\nthe structural masses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52. A garden path with hedgerows, trellis, and\r\nbench, in formal treatment.]\r\n\r\nThe best planting, as the best painting and the best music, is possible\r\nonly with the best and tenderest feeling and the closest living with\r\nnature. One’s place grows to be a reflection of himself, changing as he\r\nchanges, and expressing his life and sympathies to the last.\r\n\r\n_Review_\r\n\r\nWe have now discussed some of the principles and applications of\r\nlandscape architecture or landscape gardening, particularly in\r\nreference to the planting. The object of landscape gardening is _to\r\nmake a picture_. All the grading, seeding, planting, are incidental and\r\nsupplemental to this one central idea. The greensward is the canvas,\r\nthe house or some other prominent point is the central figure, the\r\nplanting completes the composition and adds the color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53. An enclosure for lawn games.] [Illustration:\r\nFig. 54. Sunlight and shadow.]\r\n\r\nThe second conception is the principle that _the picture should have a\r\nlandscape effect_. That is, it should be nature-like. Carpet-beds are\r\nmasses of color, not pictures. They are the little garnishings and\r\nreliefs that are to be used very cautiously, as little eccentricities\r\nand conventionalisms in a building should never be more than very minor\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nEvery other concept in landscape gardening is subordinate to these two.\r\nSome of the most important of these secondary yet underlying\r\nconsiderations are as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe place is to be conceived of as _a unit_. If a building is not\r\npleasing, ask an architect to improve it. The real architect will study\r\nthe building as a whole, grasp its design and meaning, and suggest\r\nimprovements that will add to the forcefulness of the entire structure.\r\nA dabbler would add a chimney here, a window there, and apply various\r\ndaubs of paint to the building. Each of these features might be good in\r\nitself. The paints might be the best of ochre, ultramarine, or paris\r\ngreen, but they might have no relation to the building as a whole and\r\nwould be only ludicrous. These two examples illustrate the difference\r\nbetween landscape gardening and the scattering over the place of mere\r\nornamental features.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55. An upland garden, with grass-grown steps,\r\nsundial, and edge of foxgloves.] [Illustration: Fig. 56. A garden\r\ncorner.]\r\n\r\nThere should be _one central and emphatic point in the picture_. A\r\npicture of a battle draws its interest from the action of a central\r\nfigure or group. The moment the incidental and lateral figures are made\r\nas prominent as the central figures, the picture loses emphasis, life,\r\nand meaning. The borders of a place are of less importance than its\r\ncenter. Therefore:\r\n\r\n_Keep the center of the place open_;\r\n\r\n_Frame and mass the sides; Avoid scattered effects_.\r\n\r\nIn a landscape picture _flowers are incidents_. They add emphasis,\r\nsupply color, give variety and finish; they are the ornaments, but the\r\nlawn and the mass-plantings make the framework. One flower in the\r\nborder, and made an incident of the picture, is more effective than\r\ntwenty flowers in the center of the lawn.\r\n\r\nMore depends on _the positions that plants occupy with reference to\r\neach other and to the structural design of the place_, than on the\r\nintrinsic merits of the plants themselves.\r\n\r\nLandscape gardening, then, is the embellishment of grounds in such a\r\nway that they will have a nature-like or landscape effect. The flowers\r\nand accessories may heighten and accelerate the effect, but they should\r\nnot contradict it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57. An old-fashioned doorway.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58. An informally treated stream.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nEXECUTION OF SOME OF THE LANDSCAPE FEATURES\r\n\r\nThe general lay-out of a small home property having now been\r\nconsidered, we may discuss the practical operations of executing the\r\nplan. It is not intended in this chapter to discuss the general\r\nquestion of how to handle the soil: that discussion comes in Chapter\r\nIV; nor in detail how to handle plants: that occurs in Chapters V to X;\r\nbut the subjects of grading, laying out of walks and drives, executing\r\nthe border plantings, and the making of lawns, may be briefly\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nOf course the instructions given in a book, however complete, are very\r\ninadequate and unsatisfactory as compared with the advice of a good\r\nexperienced person. It is not always possible to find such a person,\r\nhowever; and it is no little satisfaction to the homemaker if he can\r\nfeel that he can handle the work himself, even at the expense of some\r\nmistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The grading_.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration is to grade the land. Grading is very\r\nexpensive, especially if performed at a season when the soil is heavy\r\nwith water. Every effort should be made, therefore, to reduce the\r\ngrading to a minimum and still secure a pleasing contour. A good time\r\nto grade, if one has the time, is in the fall before the heavy rains\r\ncome, and then allow the surface to settle until spring, when the\r\nfinish may be made. All filling will settle in time unless thoroughly\r\ntamped as it proceeds.\r\n\r\nThe smaller the area the more pains must be taken with the grading; but\r\nin any plat that is one hundred feet or more square, very considerable\r\nundulations may be left in the surface with excellent effect. In lawns\r\nof this size, or even half this size, it is rarely advisable to have\r\nthem perfectly flat and level. They should slope gradually away from\r\nthe house; and when the lawn is seventy-five feet or more in width, it\r\nmay be slightly crowning with good effect. A lawn should never be\r\nhollow,—that is, lower in the center than at the borders,—and broad\r\nlawns that are perfectly flat and level often appear to be hollow. A\r\nslope of one foot in twenty or thirty is none too much for a pleasant\r\ngrade in lawns of some extent.\r\n\r\nIn small places, the grading may be done by the eye, unless there are\r\nvery particular conditions to meet. In large or difficult areas, it is\r\nwell to have the place contoured by instruments. This is particularly\r\ndesirable if the grading is to be done on contract. A basal or datum\r\nline is established, above or below which all surfaces are to be shaped\r\nat measured distances. Even in small yards, such a datum line is\r\ndesirable for the best kind of work.\r\n\r\n_The terrace_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59. A terrace in the distance; in the foreground an\r\nideal “running out” of the bank.]\r\n\r\nIn places in which the natural slope is very perceptible, there is a\r\ntendency to terrace the lawn for the purpose of making the various\r\nparts or sections of it more or less level and plane. In nearly all\r\ncases, however, a terrace in a main lawn is objectionable. It cuts the\r\nlawn into two or more portions, and thereby makes it look smaller and\r\nspoils the effect of the picture. A terrace always obtrudes a hard and\r\nrigid line, and fastens the attention upon itself rather than upon the\r\nlandscape. Terraces are also expensive to make and to keep in order;\r\nand a shabby terrace is always distracting.\r\n\r\nWhen formal effects are desired, their success depends, however, very\r\nlargely on the rigidity of the lines and the care with which they are\r\nmaintained. If a terrace is necessary, it should be in the form of a\r\nretaining wall next the street, or else it should lie next the\r\nbuilding, giving as broad and continuous a lawn as possible. It should\r\nbe remembered, however, that a terrace next a building should not be a\r\npart of the landscape, but a part of the architecture; that is, it\r\nshould serve as a base to the building. It will at once be seen,\r\ntherefore, that terraces are most in place against those buildings that\r\nhave strong horizontal lines, and they are little suitable against\r\nbuildings with very broken lines and mixed or gothic features. In order\r\nto join the terrace to the building, it is usually advisable to place\r\nsome architectural feature upon its crown, as a balustrade, and to\r\nascend it by means of architectural steps. The terrace elevation,\r\ntherefore, becomes a part of the base of the building, and the top of\r\nit is an esplanade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. Treatment of a sloping lawn.]\r\n\r\nA simple and gradually sloping bank can nearly always be made to take\r\nthe place of a terrace. For example, let the operator make a terrace,\r\nwith sharp angles above and below, in the fall of the year; in the\r\nspring, he will find (if he has not sodded it heavily) that nature has\r\ntaken the matter in hand and the upper angle of the terrace has been\r\nwashed away and deposited in the lower angle, and the result is the\r\nbeginning of a good series of curves. Figure 59 shows an ideal slope,\r\nwith its double curve, comprising a convex curve on the top of the\r\nbank, and a concave curve at the lower part. This is a slope that would\r\nordinarily be terraced, but in its present condition it is a part of\r\nthe landscape picture. It may be mown as readily as any other part of\r\nthe lawn, and it takes care of itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61. Treatment of a very steep bank.]\r\n\r\nThe diagrams in Fig. 60 indicate poor and good treatment of a lawn. The\r\nterraces are not needed in this case; or if they are, they should never\r\nbe made as at 1. The same dip could be taken up in a single curved\r\nbank, as at 3, but the better way, in general, is to give the treatment\r\nshown in 2. Figure 61 shows how a very high terrace, 4, can be\r\nsupplaced by a sloping bank 5. Figure 62 shows a terrace that falls\r\naway too suddenly from the house.\r\n\r\n_The bounding lines_.\r\n\r\nIn grading to the borders of the place, it is not always necessary, nor\r\neven desirable, that a continuous contour should be maintained,\r\nespecially if the border is higher or lower than the lawn. A somewhat\r\nirregular line of grade will appear to be most natural, and lend itself\r\nbest to effective planting. This is specially true in the grade to\r\nwatercourses, which, as a rule, should be more or less devious or\r\nwinding; and the adjacent land should, therefore, present various\r\nheights and contours. It is not always necessary, however, to make\r\ndistinct banks along water-courses, particularly if the place is small\r\nand the natural lay of the land is more or less plane or flat. A very\r\nslight depression, as shown in Fig. 63, may answer all the purposes of\r\na water grade in such places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62. A terrace or slope that falls too suddenly away\r\nfrom a building. There should be a level place or esplanade next the\r\nbuilding, if possible.]\r\n[Illustration: 63. Shaping the land down to a water-course.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desirable that the lawn be as large and spacious as possible,\r\nthen the boundary of it should be removed. Take away the fences,\r\ncurbing, and other right lines. In rural places, a sunken fence may\r\nsometimes be placed athwart the lawn at its farther edge for the\r\npurpose of keeping cattle off the place, and thereby bring in the\r\nadjacent landscape. Figure 64 suggests how this may be done. The\r\ndepression near the foot of the lawn, which is really a ditch and\r\nscarcely visible from the upper part of the place because of the slight\r\nelevation on its inner rim, answers all the purposes of a fence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64. A sunken fence athwart a foreground.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65. Protecting a tree in filled land.]\r\n\r\nNearly all trees are injured if the dirt is filled about the base to\r\nthe depth of a foot or more. The natural base of the plant should be\r\nexposed so far as possible, not only for protection of the tree, but\r\nbecause the base of a tree trunk is one of its most distinctive\r\nfeatures. Oaks, maples, and in fact most trees will lose their bark\r\nnear the crown if the dirt is piled against them; and this is\r\nespecially true if the water tends to settle about the trunks. Figure\r\n65 shows how this difficulty may be obviated. A well is stoned up,\r\nallowing a space of a foot or two on all sides, and tile drains are\r\nlaid about the base of the well, as shown in the diagram at the right.\r\nA grating to cover a well is also shown. It is often possible to make a\r\nsloping bank just above the tree, and to allow the ground to fall away\r\nfrom the roots on the lower side, so that there is no well or hole; but\r\nthis is practicable only when the land below, the tree is considerably\r\nlower than that above it.\r\n\r\nIf much of the surface is to be removed, the good top earth should be\r\nsaved, and placed back on the area, in which to sow the grass seed and\r\nto make the plantings. This top soil may be piled at one side out of\r\nthe way while the grading is proceeding.\r\n\r\n_Walks and drives_.\r\n\r\nSo far as the picture in the landscape is concerned, walks and drives\r\nare blemishes. Since they are necessary, however, they must form a part\r\nof the landscape design. They should be as few as possible, not only\r\nbecause they interfere with the artistic composition, but also because\r\nthey are expensive to make and to maintain.\r\n\r\nMost places have too many, rather than too few, walks and drives. Small\r\ncity areas rarely need a driveway entrance, not even to the back door.\r\nThe back yard in Fig. 39 illustrates this point. The distance from the\r\nhouse to the street on the back is about ninety feet, yet there is no\r\ndriveway in the place. The coal and provisions are carried in; and,\r\nalthough the deliverymen may complain at first, they very soon accept\r\nthe inevitable. It is not worth the while to maintain a drive in such a\r\nplace for the convenience of truckmen and grocers. Neither is it often\r\nnecessary to have a drive in the front yard if the house is within\r\nseventy-five or one hundred feet of the street. When a drive is\r\nnecessary, it should enter, if possible, at the side of the residence,\r\nand not make a circle in the front lawn. This remark may not apply to\r\nareas of a half acre or more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66. Forms of front walks.]\r\n\r\nThe drives and walks should be direct. They should go where they appear\r\nto go, and should be practically the shortest distances between the\r\npoints to be reached. Figure 66 illustrates some of the problems\r\nconnected with walks to the front door. A common type of walk is _a_,\r\nand it is a nuisance. The time that one loses in going around the\r\ncameo-set in the center would be sufficient, if conserved, to lengthen\r\na man’s life by several months or a year. Such a device has no merit in\r\nart or convenience. Walk _b_ is better, but still is not ideal,\r\ninasmuch as it makes too much of a right-angled curve, and the\r\npedestrian desires to cut across the corner. Such a walk, also, usually\r\nextends too far beyond the corner of the house to make it appear to be\r\ndirect. It has the merit, however, of leaving the center of the lawn\r\npractically untouched. The curve in walk _d_ is ordinarily unnecessary\r\nunless the ground is rolling. In small places, like this, it is better\r\nto have a straight walk directly from the sidewalk to the house. In\r\nfact, this is true in nearly all cases in which the lawn is not more\r\nthan forty to seventy-five feet deep. Plan _c_ is also inexcusable. A\r\nstraight walk would answer every purpose better. Any walk that passes\r\nthe house, and returns to it, _e_, is inexcusable unless it is\r\nnecessary to make a very steep ascent. If most of the traveling is in\r\none direction from the house, a walk like _f_ may be the most direct\r\nand efficient. It is known as a direct curve, and is a compound of a\r\nconcave and a convex curve.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that any service walk or drive, however long, should be\r\ncontinuous in direction and design from end to end. Figure 67\r\nillustrates a long drive that contradicts this principle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67. A patched-up drive, showing meaningless\r\ncrooks.]\r\n\r\nIt is a series of meaningless curves. The reason for these curves is\r\nthe fact that the drive was extended from time to time as new houses\r\nwere added to the villa. The reader will easily perceive how all the\r\nkinks might be taken out of this drive and one direct and bold curve be\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\nThe question of drainage, curbing, and gutters.\r\n\r\nThorough drainage, natural or artificial, is essential to hard and\r\npermanent walks and drives. This point is too often neglected. On the\r\ndraining and grading of residence streets a well-known landscape\r\ngardener, O.C. Simonds, writes as follows in “Park and Cemetery”:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68. Treatment of walk and drive in a suburban\r\nregion. There are no curbs.]\r\n\r\n“The surface drainage is something that interests us whenever it rains\r\nor when the snow melts. It has been customary to locate catch-basins\r\nfor receiving the surface water at street intersections. This\r\narrangement causes most of the surface water from both streets to run\r\npast the crossings, making it necessary to depress the pavement, so\r\nthat one must step down and up in going from one side of a street to\r\nthe other, or else a passageway for the water must be made through the\r\ncrossing. It may be said that a step down to the pavement and up again\r\nto the sidewalk at the street intersections is of no consequence, but\r\nit is really more elegant and satisfactory to have the walk practically\r\ncontinuous (Fig. 68). With the catch-basin at the corner, the stoppage\r\nof the inlet, or a great fall of rain, sometimes covers the crossing\r\nwith water, so one must either wade or go out of his way. With\r\ncatch-basins placed in the center of the blocks, or, if the blocks are\r\nlong, at some distance from the crossing, the intersections can be kept\r\nrelatively high and dry. Roadways are generally made crowning in the\r\ncenter so that water runs to the sides, but frequently the fall\r\nlengthwise of the roadway is less than it should be. City engineers are\r\nusually inclined to make the grade along the length of a street as\r\nnearly level as possible. Authorities who have given the subject of\r\nroads considerable study recommend a fall lengthwise of not less than\r\none foot in one hundred and twenty-five, nor more than six feet in one\r\nhundred. Such grades are not always feasible, but a certain amount of\r\nvariation in level can usually be made in a residence street which will\r\nmake it much more pleasing in appearance, and have certain practical\r\nadvantages in keeping the street dry. The water is usually confined to\r\nthe edge of the pavement by curbing, which may rise anywhere from four\r\nto fourteen inches above the surface. This causes all the water falling\r\non the roadway to seek the catch-basin and be wasted, excepting for its\r\nuse in flushing the sewer. If the curbing, which is really unnecessary\r\nin most cases, were omitted, much of the surface water would soak into\r\nthe ground between the sidewalk and the pavement, doing much good to\r\ntrees, shrubs, and grass. The roots of the trees naturally extend as\r\nfar, or farther, than their branches, and for their good the ground\r\nunder the pavement and sidewalk should be supplied with a certain\r\namount of moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. A tree that gives character to a place. VI. A tree that gives\r\ncharacter to a place.\r\n\r\n“The arrangement made for the removal of surface water from the street\r\nmust also take care of the surplus water from adjacent lots, so there\r\nis a practical advantage in having the level of the street lower than\r\nthat of the ground adjoining. The appearance of houses and home grounds\r\nis also much better when they are higher than the street, and for this\r\nreason it is usually desirable to keep the latter as low as possible\r\nand give the underground pipes sufficient covering to protect them from\r\nfrost. Where the ground is high and the sewers very deep, the grades\r\nshould, of course, be determined with reference to surface conditions\r\nonly. It sometimes happens that this general arrangement of the grades\r\nof home grounds, which is desirable on most accounts, causes water from\r\nmelting snow to flow over the sidewalk in the winter time, where it may\r\nfreeze and be dangerous to pedestrians. A slight depression of the lot\r\naway from the sidewalk and then an ascent toward the house would\r\nusually remedy this difficulty, and also make the house appear higher.\r\nSometimes, however, a pipe should be placed underneath the sidewalk to\r\nallow water to reach the street from inside of the lot line. The aim in\r\nsurface drainage should always be to keep the traveled portions of the\r\nstreet in the most perfect condition for use. The quick removal of\r\nsurplus water from sidewalks, crossings, and roadways will help insure\r\nthis result.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. A common form of edge for walk or drive.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70. A better form.]\r\n\r\nThese remarks concerning the curbings and hard edges of city streets\r\nmay also be applied to walks and drives in small grounds. Figure 69,\r\nfor example, shows the common method of treating the edge of a walk, by\r\nmaking a sharp and sheer elevation. This edge needs constant trimming,\r\nelse it becomes unshapely; and this trimming tends to widen the walk.\r\nFor general purposes, a border, like that shown in Fig. 70, is better.\r\nThe sod rolls over until it meets the walk, and the lawn-mower is able\r\nto keep it in condition. If it becomes more or less rough and\r\nirregular, it is pounded down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71. Sod cutter.]\r\n\r\nIf it is thought necessary to trim the edges of walks and drives, then\r\none of the various kinds of sod-cutters that are sold by dealers may be\r\nused for the purpose, or an old hoe may have its shank straightened and\r\nthe corners of the blade rounded off, as shown in Fig. 71, and this\r\nwill answer all purposes of the common sod-cutter; or, a sharp,\r\nstraight-edged spade may sometimes be used. The loose overhanging grass\r\non these edges is ordinarily cut by large shears made for the purpose.\r\n\r\nWalks and drives should be laid in such direction that they will tend\r\nto drain themselves; but if it is necessary to have gutters, these\r\nshould be deep and sharp at the bottom, for the water then draws\r\ntogether and tends to keep the gutter clean. A shallow and rounded\r\nbrick or cobble gutter does not clean itself; it is very likely to fill\r\nwith weeds, and vehicles often drive in it. The best gutters and curbs\r\nare now made of cement. Figure 72 shows a catch basin at the left of a\r\nwalk or drive, and the tile laid underneath for the purpose of carrying\r\naway the surface water.\r\n\r\nThe materials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72. Draining the gutter and the drive.]\r\n\r\nThe best materials for the main walks are cement and stone flagging. In\r\nmany soils, however, there is enough binding material in the land to\r\nmake a good walk without the addition of any other material. Gravel,\r\ncinders, ashes, and the like, are nearly always inadvisable, for they\r\nare liable to be loose in dry weather and sticky in wet weather. In the\r\nlaying of cement it is important that the walk be well drained by a\r\nlayer of a foot or two of broken stone or brickbats, unless the walk is\r\non loose and leachy land or in a frostless country.\r\n\r\nIn back yards it is often best not to have any well-defined walk. A\r\nramble across the sod may be as good. For a back walk, over which\r\ndelivery men are to travel, one of the very best means is to sink a\r\nfoot-wide plank into the earth on a level with the surface of the sod;\r\nand it is not necessary that the walk be perfectly straight. These\r\nwalks do not interfere with the work of the lawn-mower, and they take\r\ncare of themselves. When the plank rots, at the expiration of five to\r\nten years, the plank is taken up and another one dropped in its place.\r\nThis ordinarily makes the best kind of a walk alongside a rear border.\r\n(Plate XI.) In gardens, nothing is better for a walk than tanbark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. Planting alongside a walk.]\r\n\r\nThe sides of walks and drives may often be planted with shrubbery. It\r\nis not necessary that they always have prim and definite borders.\r\nFigure 73 illustrates a bank of foliage which breaks up the hard line\r\nof a walk, and serves also as a border for the growing of flowers and\r\ninteresting specimens. This walk is also characterized by the absence\r\nof high and hard borders. Figure 68 illustrates this fact, and also\r\nshows how the parking between the walk and the street may be\r\neffectively planted.\r\n\r\n_Making the borders_.\r\n\r\nThe borders and groups of planting are laid out on the paper plan.\r\nThere are several ways of transferring them to the ground. Sometimes\r\nthey are not made until after the lawn is established, when the\r\ninexperienced operator may more readily lay them out. Usually, however,\r\nthe planting and lawn-making proceed more or less simultaneously. After\r\nthe shaping of the ground has been completed, the areas are marked off\r\nby stakes, by a limp rope laid on the surface, or by a mark made with a\r\nrake handle. The margin once determined, the lawn may be seeded and\r\nrolled (Fig. 40), and the planting allowed to proceed as it may; or the\r\nplanting may all be done inside the borders, and the seeding then be\r\napplied to the lawn. If the main dimensions of the borders and beds are\r\ncarefully measured and marked by stakes, it is an easy matter to\r\ncomplete the outline by making a mark with a stick or rakestale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74. A bowered pathway.] [Illustration: Fig. 75.\r\nObjects for pity.]\r\n\r\nThe planting may be done in spring or fall,—in fall preferably if the\r\nstock is ready (and of hardy species) and the land in perfect condition\r\nof drainage; usually, however, things are not ready early enough in the\r\nfall for any extended planting, and the work is commonly done as soon\r\nas the ground settles in spring (see Chapter V). Head the bushes back.\r\nDig up the entire area. Spade up the ground, set the bushes thick, hoe\r\nthem at intervals, and then let them go. If you do not like the bare\r\nearth between them, sow in the seeds of hardy annual flowers, like\r\nphlox, petunia, alyssum, and pinks. Never set the bushes in holes dug\r\nin the old sod (Fig. 75). The person who plants his shrubs in holes in\r\nthe sward does not seriously mean to make any foliage mass, and it is\r\nlikely that he does not know what relation the border mass has to\r\nartistic planting. The illustration, Fig. 76, shows the office that a\r\nshrubbery may perform in relation to a building; this particular\r\nbuilding was erected in an open field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 76. A border group, limiting the space next the\r\nresidence and separating it from the fields and the clothes-yards.]\r\n\r\nI have said to plant the bushes thick. This is for quick effect. It is\r\nan easy matter to thin the plantation if it becomes too thick. All\r\ncommon bushes may usually be planted as close as two to three feet\r\napart each way, especially if one gets many of them from the fields, so\r\nthat he does not have to buy them. If there are not sufficient of the\r\npermanent bushes for thick planting, the spaces may be tilled\r\ntemporarily by cheaper or commoner bushes: but do not forget to remove\r\nthe fillers as rapidly as the others need the room.\r\n\r\n_Making the lawn_.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done in the making of a lawn is to establish the\r\nproper grade. This should be worked out with the greatest care, from\r\nthe fact that when a lawn is once made, its level and contour should\r\nnever be changed.\r\n\r\nPreparing the ground.\r\n\r\nThe next important step is to prepare the ground deeply and thoroughly.\r\nThe permanence of the sod will depend very largely on the fertility and\r\npreparation of the soil in the beginning. The soil should be deep and\r\nporous, so that the roots will strike far into it, and be enabled\r\nthereby to withstand droughts and cold winters. The best means of\r\ndeepening the soil, as explained in Chapter IV, is by tile-draining;\r\nbut it can also be accomplished to some extent by the use of the\r\nsubsoil plow and by trenching. Since the lawn cannot be refitted,\r\nhowever, the subsoil is likely to fall back into a hard-pan in a few\r\nyears if it has been subsoiled or trenched, whereas a good tile-drain\r\naffords a permanent amelioration of the under soil. Soils that are\r\nnaturally loose and porous may not need this extra attention. In fact,\r\nlands that are very loose and sandy may require to be packed or\r\ncemented rather than loosened. One of the best means of doing this is\r\nto fill them with humus, so that the water will not leach through them\r\nrapidly. Nearly all lands that are designed for lawns are greatly\r\nbenefited by heavy dressings of manure thoroughly worked into them in\r\nthe beginning, although it is possible to get the ground too rich on\r\nthe surface at first; it is not necessary that all the added plant-food\r\nbe immediately available.\r\n\r\nThe lawn will profit by an annual application of good chemical\r\nfertilizer. Ground bone is one of the best materials to apply, at the\r\nrate of three hundred to four hundred pounds to the acre. It is usually\r\nsown broadcast, early in spring. Dissolved South Carolina rock may be\r\nused instead, but the application will need to be heavier if similar\r\nresults are expected. Yellow and poor grass may often be reinvigorated\r\nby an application of two hundred to three hundred pounds to the acre of\r\nnitrate of soda. Wood ashes are often good, particularly on soils that\r\ntend to be acid. Muriate of potash is not so often used, although it\r\nmay produce excellent results in some cases. There is no invariable\r\nrule. The best plan is for the lawn-maker to try the different\r\ntreatments on a little piece or corner of the lawn; in this way, he\r\nshould secure more valuable information than can be got otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe first operation after draining and grading is the plowing or\r\nspading of the surface. If the area is large enough to admit a team,\r\nthe surface is worked down by means of harrows of various kinds.\r\nAfterwards it is leveled by means of shovels and hoes, and finally by\r\ngarden rakes. The more finely and completely the soil is pulverized,\r\nthe quicker the lawn may be secured, and the more permanent are the\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe kind of grass.\r\n\r\nThe best grass for the body or foundation of lawns in the North is\r\nJune-grass or Kentucky blue-grass (_Poa pratensis_), not Canada\r\nblue-grass (_Poa compressa_).\r\n\r\nWhether white clover or other seed should be sown with the grass seed\r\nis very largely a personal question. Some persons like it, and others\r\ndo not. If it is desired, it may be sown directly after the grass seed\r\nis sown, at the rate of one to four quarts or more to the acre.\r\n\r\nFor special purposes, other grasses may be used for lawns. Various\r\nkinds of lawn mixtures are on the market, for particular uses, and some\r\nof them are very good.\r\n\r\nA superintendent of parks in one of the Eastern cities gives the\r\nfollowing experience on kinds of grass: “For the meadows on the large\r\nparks we generally use extra recleaned Kentucky blue-grass, red-top,\r\nand white clover, in the proportion of thirty pounds of blue-grass,\r\nthirty pounds of red-top, and ten pounds of white clover to the acre.\r\nSometimes we use for smaller lawns the blue-grass and red-top without\r\nthe white clover. We have used blue-grass, red-top, and Rhode Island\r\nbent in the proportion of twenty pounds each, and ten pounds of white\r\nclover to the acre, but the Rhode Island bent is so expensive that we\r\nrarely buy it. For grass in shady places, as in a grove, we use\r\nKentucky blue-grass and rough-stalked meadow-grass (_Poa trivialis_) in\r\nequal parts at the rate of seventy pounds to the acre. On the golf\r\nlinks we use blue-grass without any mixture on some of the putting\r\ngreens; sometimes we use Rhode Island bent, and on sandy greens we use\r\nred-top. We always buy each kind of seed separately and mix them, and\r\nare particular to get the best extra recleaned of each kind. Frequently\r\nwe get the seed of three different dealers to secure the best.”\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the June-grass germinates and grows somewhat slowly, and\r\nit is usually advisable to sow four or five quarts of timothy grass to\r\nthe acre with the June-grass seed. The timothy comes on quickly and\r\nmakes a green the first year, and the June-grass soon crowds it out. It\r\nis not advisable to sow grain in the lawn as a nurse to the grass. If\r\nthe land is well prepared and the seed is sown in the cool part of the\r\nyear, the grass ought to grow much better without the other crops than\r\nwith them. Lands that are hard and lacking in nitrogen may be benefited\r\nif crimson clover (four or five quarts) is sown with the grass seed.\r\nThis will make a green the first year, and will break up the subsoil by\r\nits deep roots and supply nitrogen, and being an annual plant it does\r\nnot become troublesome, if mown frequently enough to prevent seeding.\r\n\r\nIn the southern states, where June-grass does not thrive, Bermuda-grass\r\nis the leading species used for lawns; although there are two or three\r\nothers, as the goose-grass of Florida, that may be used in special\r\nlocalities. Bermuda-grass is usually propagated by roots, but imported\r\nseed (said to be from Australia) is now available. The Bermuda-grass\r\nbecomes reddish after frost; and English rye-grass may be sown on the\r\nBermuda sod in August or September far south for winter green; in\r\nspring the Bermuda crowds it out.\r\n\r\nWhen and how to sow the seed.\r\n\r\nThe lawn should be seeded when the land is moist and the weather\r\ncomparatively cool. It is ordinarily most advisable to grade the lawn\r\nin late summer or early fall, because the land is then comparatively\r\ndry and can be moved cheaply. The surface can also be got in condition,\r\nperhaps, for sowing late in September or early in October in the North;\r\nor, if the surface has required much filling, it is well to leave it in\r\na somewhat unfinished state until spring, in order that the soft places\r\nmay settle and then be refilled before the seeding is done. If the seed\r\ncan be sown early in the fall, before the rains come, the grass should\r\nbe large enough, except in northernmost localities, to withstand the\r\nwinter; but it is generally most desirable to sow in very early spring.\r\nIf the land has been thoroughly prepared in the fall, the seed may be\r\nsown on one of the late light snows in spring and as the snow melts the\r\nseed is carried into the land, and germinates very quickly. If the seed\r\nis sown when the land is loose and workable, it should be raked in; and\r\nif the weather promises to be dry or the sowing is late, the surface\r\nshould be rolled.\r\n\r\nThe seeding is usually done broadcast by hand on all small areas, the\r\nsower going both ways (at right angles) across the area to lessen the\r\nlikelihood of missing any part. Steep banks are sometimes sown with\r\nseed that is mixed in mold or earth to which water is added until the\r\nmaterial will just run through the spout of a watering-can; the\r\nmaterial is then poured on the surface, which is first made loose.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as we desire to secure many very fine stalks of grass rather\r\nthan a few large ones, it is essential that the seed be sown very\r\nthick. Three to five bushels to the acre is the ordinary application of\r\ngrass seed (page 79).\r\n\r\nSecuring a firm sod.\r\n\r\nThe lawn will ordinarily produce a heavy crop of weeds the first year,\r\nespecially if much stable manure has been used. The weeds need not be\r\npulled, unless such vicious intruders as docks or other perennial\r\nplants gain a foothold; but the area should be mown frequently with a\r\nlawn-mower. The annual weeds die at the approach of cold, and they are\r\nkept down by the use of the lawn-mower, while the grass is not injured.\r\n\r\nIt rarely happens that every part of the lawn will have an equal catch\r\nof grass. The bare or sparsely seeded places should be sown again every\r\nfall and spring until the lawn is finally complete. In fact, it\r\nrequires constant attention to keep a lawn in good sod, and it must be\r\ncontinuously in the process of making. It is not every lawn area, or\r\nevery part of the area, that is adapted to grass; and it may require\r\nlong study to find out why it is not. Bare or poor places should be\r\nhetcheled up strongly with an iron-toothed rake, perhaps fertilized\r\nagain, and then reseeded. It is unusual that a lawn does not need\r\nrepairing every year. Lawns of several acres which become thin and\r\nmossy may be treated in essentially the same way by dragging them with\r\na spike-tooth harrow in early spring as soon as the land is dry enough\r\nto hold a team. Chemical fertilizers and grass seed are now sown\r\nliberally, and the area is perhaps dragged again, although this is not\r\nalways essential; and then the roller is applied to bring the surface\r\ninto a smooth condition. To plow up these poor lawns is to renew all\r\nthe battle with weeds, and really to make no progress; for, so long as\r\nthe contour is correct, the lawn may be repaired by these surface\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nThe stronger the sward, the less the trouble with weeds; yet it is\r\npractically impossible to keep dandelions and some other weeds out of\r\nlawns except by cutting them out with a knife thrust underground (there\r\nare good spuds manufactured for this purpose, Figs. 108 to 111). If the\r\nsod is very thin after the weeds are removed, sow more grass seed.\r\n\r\nThe mowing.\r\n\r\nThe mowing of the lawn should begin as soon as the grass is tall enough\r\nin the spring and continue at the necessary intervals throughout the\r\nsummer. The most frequent mowings are needed early in the season, when\r\nthe grass is growing rapidly. If it is mown frequently—say once or\r\ntwice a week—in the periods of most vigorous growth, it will not be\r\nnecessary to rake off the mowings. In fact, it is preferable to leave\r\nthe grass on the lawn, to be driven into the surface by the rains and\r\nto afford a mulch. It is only when the lawn has been neglected and the\r\ngrass has got so high that it becomes unsightly on the lawn, or when\r\nthe growth is unusually luxurious, that it is necessary to take it off.\r\nIn dry weather care should be taken not to mow the lawn any more than\r\nabsolutely necessary. The grass should be rather long when it goes into\r\nthe winter. In the last two months of open weather the grass makes\r\nsmall growth, and it tends to lop down and to cover the surface\r\ndensely, which it should be allowed to do.\r\n\r\nFall treatment.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, it is not necessary to rake all the leaves off lawns in the\r\nfall. They afford an excellent mulch, and in the autumn months the\r\nleaves on the lawn are among the most attractive features of the\r\nlandscape. The leaves generally blow off after a time, and if the place\r\nhas been constructed with an open center and heavily planted sides, the\r\nleaves will be caught in these masses of trees and shrubs and there\r\nafford an excellent mulch. The ideal landscape planting, therefore,\r\ntakes care of itself to a very large extent. It is bad economy to burn\r\nthe leaves, especially if one has herbaceous borders, roses, and other\r\nplants that need a mulch. When the leaves are taken off the borders in\r\nthe spring, they should be piled with the manure or other refuse and\r\nthere allowed to pass into compost (pages 110, 111).\r\n\r\nIf the land has been well prepared in the beginning, and its life is\r\nnot sapped by large trees, it is ordinarily unnecessary to cover the\r\nlawn with manure in the fall. The common practice of covering grass\r\nwith raw manure should be discouraged because the material is unsightly\r\nand unsavory, and the same results can be got with the use of\r\ncommercial fertilizers combined with dressings of very fine and\r\nwell-rotted compost or manure, and by not raking the lawn too clean of\r\nthe mowings of the grass.\r\n\r\nSpring treatment.\r\n\r\nEvery spring the lawn should be firmed by means of a roller, or, if the\r\narea is small, by means of a pounder, or the back of a spade in the\r\nhands of a vigorous man. The lawn-mower itself tends to pack the\r\nsurface. If there are little irregularities in the surface, caused by\r\ndepressions of an inch or so, and the highest places are not above the\r\ncontour-line of the lawn, the surface may be brought to level by\r\nspreading fine, mellow soil over it, thereby filling up the\r\ndepressions. The grass will quickly grow through this soil. Little\r\nhummocks may be cut off, some of the earth removed, and the sod\r\nreplaced.\r\n\r\nWatering lawns.\r\n\r\nThe common watering of lawns by means of lawn sprinklers usually does\r\nmore harm than good. This results from the fact that the watering is\r\ngenerally done in clear weather, and the water is thrown through the\r\nair in very fine spray, so that a considerable part of it is lost in\r\nvapor. The ground is also hot, and the water does not pass deep into\r\nthe soil. If the lawn is watered at all, it should be soaked; turn on\r\nthe hose at nightfall and let it run until the land is wet as deep as\r\nit is dry, then move the hose to another place. A thorough soaking like\r\nthis, a few times in a dry summer, will do more good than sprinkling\r\nevery day. If the land is deeply prepared in the first place, so that\r\nthe roots strike far into the soil, there is rarely need of watering\r\nunless the place is arid, the season unusually dry, or the moisture\r\nsucked out by trees. The surface sprinkling engenders a tendency of\r\nroots to start near the surface, and therefore the more the lawn is\r\nlightly watered, the greater is the necessity for watering it.\r\n\r\nSodding the lawn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77. Cutting sod for a lawn.]\r\n\r\nPersons who desire to secure a lawn very quickly may sod the area\r\nrather than seed it, although the most permanent results are usually\r\nsecured by seeding. Sodding, however, is expensive, and is to be used\r\nonly about the borders of the place, near buildings, or in areas in\r\nwhich the owner can afford to expend considerable money. The best sod\r\nis that which is secured from an old pasture, and for two or three\r\nreasons. In the first place, it is the right kind of grass, the\r\nJune-grass (in the North) being the species that oftenest runs into\r\npastures and crowds out other plants. Again, it has been so closely\r\neaten down, especially if it has been pastured by sheep, that it has\r\nmade a very dense and well-filled sod, which can be rolled up in thin\r\nlayers. In the third place, the soil in old pastures is likely to be\r\nrich from the droppings of animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78. Economical sodding, the spaces being seeded.]\r\n\r\nIn taking sod, it is important that it be cut very thin. An inch and a\r\nhalf thick is usually ample. It is ordinarily rolled up in strips a\r\nfoot wide and of any length that will allow the rolls to be handled by\r\none or two men. A foot-wide board is laid upon the turf, and the sod\r\ncut along either edge of it. One person then stands upon the strip of\r\nsod and rolls it towards himself, while another cuts it loose with a\r\nspade, as shown in Fig. 77. When the sod is laid, it is unrolled on the\r\nland and then firmly beaten down. Land that is to be sodded should be\r\nsoft on top, so that the sod can be well pounded into it. If the sod is\r\nnot well pounded down, it will settle unevenly and present a bad\r\nsurface, and will also dry out and perhaps not live through a dry\r\nspell. It is almost impossible to pound down sod too firm. If the land\r\nis freshly plowed, it is important that the borders that are sodded be\r\nan inch or two lower than the adjacent land, because the land will\r\nsettle in the course of a few weeks. In a dry time, the sod may be\r\ncovered from a half inch to an inch with fine, mellow soil as a mulch.\r\nThe grass should grow through this soil without difficulty. Upon\r\nterraces and steep banks, the sod may be held in place by driving\r\nwooden pegs through it.\r\n\r\nA combination of sodding and seeding.\r\n\r\nAn “economical sodding” is described in “American Garden” (Fig. 78):\r\n“To obtain sufficient sod of suitable quality for covering\r\nterrace-slopes or small blocks that for any reason cannot well be\r\nseeded is often a difficult matter. In the accompanying illustration we\r\nshow how a surface of sod may be used to good advantage over a larger\r\narea than its real measurement represents. This is done by laying the\r\nsods, cut in strips from six to ten inches wide, in lines and\r\ncross-lines, and after filling the spaces with good soil, sowing these\r\nspaces with grass-seed. Should the catch of seed for any reason be\r\npoor, the sod of the strips will tend to spread over the spaces between\r\nthem, and failure to obtain a good sward within a reasonable time is\r\nalmost out of the question. Also, if one needs sod and has no place\r\nfrom which to cut it except the lawn, by taking up blocks of sod,\r\nleaving strips and cross-strips, and treating the surface as described,\r\nthe bare places are soon covered with green.”\r\n\r\nSowing with sod.\r\n\r\nLawns may be sown with pieces of sods rather than with seeds. Sods may\r\nbe cut up into bits an inch or two square, and these may be scattered\r\nbroadcast over the area and rolled into the land. While it is\r\npreferable that the pieces should lie right side up, this is not\r\nnecessary if they are cut thin, and sown when the weather is cool and\r\nmoist. Sowing pieces of sod is good practice when it is difficult to\r\nsecure a catch from seed.\r\n\r\nIf one were to maintain a permanent sod garden, at one side, for the\r\nselecting and growing of the very best sod (as he would grow a stock\r\nseed of corn or beans), this method should be the most rational of all\r\nprocedures, at least until the time that we produce strains of lawn\r\ngrass that come true from seeds.\r\n\r\nOther ground covers.\r\n\r\nUnder trees, and in other shady places, it may be necessary to cover\r\nthe ground with something else than grass. Good plants for such uses\r\nare periwinkle (_Vinca minor_, an evergreen trailer, often called\r\n“running myrtle”), moneywort (_Lysimachia nummularia_),\r\nlily-of-the-valley, and various kinds of sedge or carex. In some dark\r\nor shady places, and under some kinds of trees, it is practically\r\nimpossible to secure a good lawn, and one may be obliged to resort to\r\ndecumbent bushes or other forms of planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nTHE HANDLING OF THE LAND\r\n\r\nAlmost any land contains enough food for the growing of good crops, but\r\nthe food elements may be chemically unavailable, or there may be\r\ninsufficient water to dissolve them. It is too long a story to explain\r\nat this place,—the philosophy of tillage and of enriching the land,—and\r\nthe reader who desires to make excursions into this delightful subject\r\nshould consult King on “The Soil,” Roberts on “The Fertility of the\r\nLand,” and recent writings of many kinds. The reader must accept my\r\nword for it that tilling the land renders it productive.\r\n\r\nI must call my reader’s attention to the fact that this book is on the\r\nmaking of gardens,—on the planning and the doing of the work from the\r\nyear’s end to end,—not on the appreciation of a completed garden. I\r\nwant the reader to know that a garden is not worth having unless he\r\nmakes it with his own hands or helps to make it. He must work himself\r\ninto it. He must know the pleasure of preparing the land, of contending\r\nwith bugs and all other difficulties, for it is only thereby that he\r\ncomes into appreciation of the real value of a garden.\r\n\r\nI am saying this to prepare the reader for the work that I lay out in\r\nthis chapter. I want him to know the real joy that there is in the\r\nsimple processes of breaking the earth and fitting it for the seed. The\r\nmore pains he takes with these processes, naturally the keener will be\r\nhis enjoyment of them. No one can have any other satisfaction than that\r\nof mere manual exercise if he does not know the reasons for what he\r\ndoes with his soil. I am sure that my keenest delight in a garden comes\r\nin the one month of the opening season and the other month of the\r\nclosing season. These are the months when I work hardest and when I am\r\nnearest the soil. To feel the thrust of the spade, to smell the sweet\r\nearth, to prepare for the young plants and then to prepare for the\r\nclosing year, to handle the tools with discrimination, to guard against\r\nfrost, to be close with the rain and wind, to see the young things\r\nstart into life and then to see them go down into winter,—these are\r\nsome of the best of the joys of gardening. In this spirit we should\r\ntake up the work of handling the land.\r\n\r\n_The draining of the land_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 79. Ditching tools.] The first step in the\r\npreparation of land, after it has been thoroughly cleared and subdued\r\nof forest or previous vegetation, is to attend to the drainage. All\r\nland that is springy, low, and “sour,” or that holds the water in\r\npuddles for a day or two following heavy rains, should be thoroughly\r\nunderdrained. Draining also improves the physical condition of the soil\r\neven when the land does not need the removal of superfluous water. In\r\nhard lands, it lowers the water-table, or tends to loosen and aerate\r\nthe soil to a greater depth, and thereby enables it to hold more water\r\nwithout injury to plants. Drainage is particularly useful in dry but\r\nhard garden lands, because these lands are often in sod or permanently\r\nplanted, and the soil cannot be broken up by deep tillage. Tile\r\ndrainage is permanent subsoiling.\r\n\r\nHard-baked cylindrical tiles make the best and most permanent drains.\r\nThe ditches usually should not be less than two and one-half feet deep,\r\nand three or three and one-half feet is often better. In most garden\r\nareas, drains may be laid with profit as often as every thirty feet.\r\nGive all drains a good and continuous fall. For single drains and for\r\nlaterals not over four hundred or five hundred feet long, a two and\r\none-half inch tile is sufficient, unless much water must be carried\r\nfrom swales or springs. In stony countries, flat stones may be used in\r\nplace of tiles, and persons who are skillful in laying them make drains\r\nas good and permanent as those constructed of tiles. The tiles or\r\nstones are covered with sods, straw, or paper, and the earth is then\r\nfilled in. This temporary cover keeps the loose dirt out of the tiles,\r\nand by the time it is rotted the earth has settled into place.\r\n\r\nIn small places, ditching must ordinarily be done wholly with hand\r\ntools. A common spade and pick are the implements usually employed,\r\nalthough a spade with a long handle and narrow blade, as shown in Fig.\r\n79, is very useful for excavating the bottom of the ditch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80. How to use a spade.]\r\n\r\nIn most cases, much time and muscle are wasted in the use of the pick.\r\nIf the digging is properly done, a spade can be used to cut the soil,\r\neven in fairly hard clay land, with no great difficulty. The essential\r\npoint in the easy use of the spade is to manage so that one edge of the\r\nspade always cuts a free or exposed surface. The illustration (Fig. 80)\r\nwill explain the method. When the operator endeavors to cut the soil in\r\nthe method shown at A, he is obliged to break both edges at every\r\nthrust of the tool; but when he cuts the slice diagonally, first\r\nthrowing his spade to the right and then to the left, as shown at B, he\r\ncuts only one side and is able to make progress without the expenditure\r\nof useless effort. These remarks will apply to any spading of the land.\r\n\r\nIn large areas, horses may be used to facilitate the work of ditching.\r\nThere are ditching plows and machines, which, however, need not be\r\ndiscussed here; but three or four furrows may be thrown out in either\r\ndirection with a strong plow, and a subsoil plow be run behind to break\r\nup the hard-pan, and this may reduce the labor of digging as much as\r\none-half. When the excavating is completed, the bottom of the ditch is\r\nevened up by means of a line or level, and the bed for the tiles is\r\nprepared by the use of a goose-neck scoop, shown in Fig. 79. It is very\r\nimportant that the outlets of drains be kept free of weeds and litter.\r\nIf the outlet is built up with mason work, to hold the end of the tile\r\nintact, very much will be added to the permanency of the drain.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Bedding with palms. If a bricked-up pit is made about the porch,\r\npot palms may be plunged in it in spring and pot conifers in winter;\r\nand fall bulbs in tin cans (so that the receptacles will not split with\r\nfrost) may be plunged among the evergreens. VII. Bedding with palms. If\r\na bricked-up pit is made about the porch, pot palms may be plunged in\r\nit in spring and pot conifers in winter; and fall bulbs in tin cans (so\r\nthat the receptacles will not split with frost) may be plunged among\r\nthe evergreens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trenching and subsoiling_.\r\n\r\nAlthough underdraining is the most important means of increasing the\r\ndepth of the soil, it is not always practicable to lay drains through\r\ngarden lands. In such cases, recourse is had to very deep preparation\r\nof the land, either every year or every two or three years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 81. Trenching with a spade.]\r\n\r\nIn small garden areas, this deep preparation will ordinarily be done by\r\ntrenching with a spade. This operation of trenching consists in\r\nbreaking up the earth two spades deep. Figure 81 explains the\r\noperation. The section at the left shows a single spading, the earth\r\nbeing thrown over to the right, leaving the subsoil exposed the whole\r\nwidth of the bed. The section at the right shows a similar operation,\r\nso far as the surface spading is concerned, but the subsoil has also\r\nbeen cut as fast as it has been exposed. This under soil is not thrown\r\nout on the surface, and usually it is not inverted; but a spadeful is\r\nlifted and then allowed to drop so that it is thoroughly broken and\r\npulverized in the manipulation.\r\n\r\nIn all lands that have a hard and high subsoil, it is usually essential\r\nto practice trenching if the best results are to be secured; this is\r\nespecially true when deep-rooted plants, as beets, parsnips, and other\r\nroot-crops, are to be grown; it prepares the soil to hold moisture; and\r\nit allows the water of heavy rainfall to pass to greater depths rather\r\nthan to be held as puddles and in mud on the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82. Home-made subsoil plow.] [Illustration: Fig.\r\n83. Forms of subsoil plows.] In places that can be entered with a team,\r\ndeep and heavy plowing to the depth of seven to ten inches may be\r\ndesirable on hard lands, especially if such lands cannot be plowed very\r\noften; and the depth of the pulverization is often extended by means of\r\nthe subsoil plow. This subsoil plow does not turn a furrow, but a\r\nsecond team draws the implement behind the ordinary plow, and the\r\nbottom of the furrow is loosened and broken. Figure 82 shows a\r\nhome-made subsoil plow, and Fig. 83 two types of commercial tools. It\r\nmust be remembered that it is the hardest lands that need subsoiling\r\nand that, therefore, the subsoil plow should be exceedingly strong.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the surface_.\r\n\r\nEvery pains should be taken to prevent the surface of the land from\r\nbecoming crusty or baked, for the hard surface establishes a capillary\r\nconnection with the moist soil beneath, and is a means of passing off\r\nthe water into the atmosphere. Loose and mellow soil also has more free\r\nplant-food, and provides the most congenial conditions for the growth\r\nof plants. The tools that one may use in preparing the surface soil are\r\nnow so many and so well adapted to the work that the gardener should\r\nfind special satisfaction in handling them.\r\n\r\nIf the soil is a stiff clay, it is often advisable to plow it or dig it\r\nin the fall, allowing it to lie rough and loose all winter, so that the\r\nweathering may pulverize and slake it. If the clay is very tenacious,\r\nit may be necessary to throw leafmold or litter over the surface before\r\nthe spading is done, to prevent the soil from running together or\r\ncementing before spring. With mellow and loamy lands, however, it is\r\nordinarily best to leave the preparation of the surface until spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84. Improvising a spading-fork.]\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of the surface, the ordinary hand tools, or spades\r\nand shovels, may be used. If, however, the soil is mellow, a fork is a\r\nbetter tool than a spade, from the fact that it does not slice the\r\nsoil, but tends to break it up into smaller and more irregular masses.\r\nThe ordinary spading-fork, with strong flat tines, is a most\r\nserviceable tool; a spading-fork for soft ground may be made from an\r\nold manure fork by cutting down the tines, as shown in Fig. 84.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the soil should not be sticky when it is prepared,\r\nas it is likely to become hard and baked and the physical condition be\r\ngreatly injured. However, land that is too wet for the reception of\r\nseeds may still be thrown up loose with a spade or fork and allowed to\r\ndry, and after two or three days the surface preparation may be\r\ncompleted with the hoe and the rake. In ordinary soils the hoe is the\r\ntool to follow the spading-fork or the spade, but for the final\r\npreparation of the surface a steel garden-rake is the ideal implement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85. Excellent types of surface plows.]\r\n\r\nIn areas, large enough to admit horse tools, the land can be fitted\r\nmore economically by means of the various types of plows, harrows, and\r\ncultivators that are to be had of any dealer in agricultural\r\nimplements. Figure 85 shows various types of model surface plows. The\r\none shown at the upper left-hand is considered by Roberts, in his\r\n“Fertility of the Land,” to be the ideal general-purpose plow, as\r\nrespects shape and method of construction.\r\n\r\nThe type of machine to be used must be determined wholly by the\r\ncharacter of the land and the purposes for which it is to be fitted.\r\nLands that are hard and cloddy may be reduced by the use of the disk or\r\nAcme harrows, shown in Fig. 86; but those that are friable and mellow\r\nmay not need such heavy and vigorous tools. On these mellower lands,\r\nthe spring-tooth harrow, types of which are shown in Fig. 87, may\r\nfollow the plow. On very hard lands, these spring-tooth harrows may\r\nfollow the disk and Acme types. The final preparation of the land is\r\naccomplished by light implements of the pattern shown in Fig. 88. These\r\nspike-tooth smoothing-harrows do for the field what the hand-rake does\r\nfor the garden-bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86. Disk and Acme harrows, for the first working of\r\nhard or cloddy land.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87. Spring-tooth harrows.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to put a very fine finish on the surface of the ground\r\nby means of horse tools, implements like the Breed or Wiard weeder may\r\nbe used. These are constructed on the principle of a spring-tooth horse\r\nhay-rake, and are most excellent, not only for fitting loose land for\r\nordinary seeding, but also for subsequent tillage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88. Spike-tooth harrow.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89. Spike-tooth and spring-tooth cultivators.]\r\n\r\nIn areas that cannot be entered with a team, various one-horse\r\nimplements may do the work that is accomplished by heavier tools in the\r\nfield. The spring-tooth cultivator, shown at the right in Fig. 89, may\r\ndo the kind of work that the spring-tooth harrows are expected to do on\r\nlarger areas; and various adjustable spike-tooth cultivators, two of\r\nwhich are shown in Fig. 89, are useful for putting a finish on the\r\nland. These tools are also available for the tilling of the surface\r\nwhen crops are growing. The spring-tooth cultivator is a most useful\r\ntool for cultivating raspberries and blackberries, and other\r\nstrong-rooted crops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90. Good type of wheel-hoe.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91. A single-blade wheel-hoe.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92. Double wheel-hoe, useful in straddling the\r\nrow.]\r\n\r\nFor still smaller areas, in which horses cannot be used and which are\r\nstill too large for tilling wholly by means of hoes and rakes, various\r\ntypes of wheel-hoes may be used. These implements are now made in great\r\nvariety of patterns, to suit any taste and almost any kind of tillage.\r\nFor the best results, it is essential that the wheel should be large\r\nand with a broad tire, that it may override obstacles. Figure 90 shows\r\nan excellent type of wheel-hoe with five blades, and Fig. 91 shows one\r\nwith a single blade and that may be used in very narrow rows.\r\nTwo-wheeled hoes (Fig. 92) are often used, particularly when it is\r\nnecessary to have the implement very steady, and the wheels may\r\nstraddle the rows of low plants. Many of these wheel-hoes are provided\r\nwith various shapes of blades, so that the implement may be adjusted to\r\nmany kinds of work. Nearly all the weeding of beds of onions and like\r\nplants can be done by means of these wheel-hoes, if the ground is well\r\nprepared in the beginning; but it must be remembered that they are of\r\ncomparatively small use on very hard and cloddy and stony lands.\r\n\r\n_The saving of moisture_.\r\n\r\nThe garden must have a liberal supply of moisture. The first effort\r\ntoward securing this supply should be the saving of the rainfall water.\r\n\r\nProper preparation and tillage put the land in such condition that it\r\nholds the water of rainfall. Land that is very hard and compact may\r\nshed the rainfall, particularly if it is sloping and if the surface is\r\nbare of vegetation. If the hard-pan is near the surface, the land\r\ncannot hold much water, and any ordinary rainfall may fill it so full\r\nthat it overflows, or puddles stand on the surface. On land in good\r\ntilth, the water of rainfall sinks away, and is not visible as free\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the moisture begins to pass from the superincumbent\r\natmosphere, evaporation begins from the surface of the land. Any body\r\ninterposed between the land and the air checks this evaporation; this\r\nis why there is moisture underneath a board. It is impracticable,\r\nhowever, to floor over the garden with boards, but any covering will\r\nhave similar effect, but in different degree. A covering of sawdust or\r\nleaves or dry ashes will prevent the loss of moisture. So will a\r\ncovering of dry earth. Now, inasmuch as the land is already covered\r\nwith earth, it only remains to loosen up a layer or stratum on top in\r\norder to secure the mulch.\r\n\r\nAll this is only a roundabout way of saying that frequent shallow\r\nsurface tillage conserves moisture. The comparatively dry and loose\r\nmulch breaks up the capillary connection between the surface soil and\r\nthe under soil, and while the mulch itself may be useless as a foraging\r\nground for roots, it more than pays its keep by its preventing of the\r\nloss of moisture; and its own soluble plant-foods are washed down into\r\nthe lower soil by the rains.\r\n\r\nAs often as the surface becomes compact, the mulch should be renewed or\r\nrepaired by the use of the rake or cultivator or harrow. Persons are\r\ndeceived by supposing that so long as the surface remains moist, the\r\nland is in the best possible condition; a moist surface may mean that\r\nwater is rapidly passing off into the atmosphere. A dry surface may\r\nmean that less evaporation is taking place, and there may be moister\r\nearth beneath it; and moisture is needed below the surface rather than\r\non top. A finely raked bed is dry on top; but the footprints of the cat\r\nremain moist, for the animal packed the soil wherever it stepped and a\r\ncapillary connection was established with the water reservoir beneath.\r\nGardeners advise firming the earth over newly planted seeds to hasten\r\ngermination. This is essential in dry times; but what we gain in\r\nhastening germination we lose in the more rapid evaporation of\r\nmoisture. The lesson is that we should loosen the soil as soon as the\r\nseeds have germinated, to reduce evaporation to the minimum. Large\r\nseeds, as beans and peas, may be planted deep and have the earth firmed\r\nabout them, and then the rake may be applied to the surface to stop the\r\nrise of moisture before it reaches the air.\r\n\r\nTwo illustrations, adapted from Roberts’s “Fertility,” show good and\r\npoor preparation of the land. Figure 93 is a section of land twelve\r\ninches deep. The under soil has been finely broken and pulverized and\r\nthen compacted. It is mellow but firm, and is an excellent water\r\nreservoir. Three inches of the surface is a mulch of loose and dry\r\nearth. Figure 94 shows an earth-mulch, but it is too shallow; and the\r\nunder soil is so open and cloddy that the water runs through it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93. To illustrate good preparation of ground.]\r\n[Illustration: 94. To illustrate poor preparation of ground.]\r\n\r\nWhen the land is once properly prepared, the soil-mulch is maintained\r\nby surface-working tools. In field practice, these tools are harrows\r\nand horse cultivators of various kinds; in home garden practice they\r\nare wheel-hoes, rakes, and many patterns of hand hoes and scarifiers,\r\nwith finger-weeders and other small implements for work directly among\r\nthe plants.\r\n\r\nA garden soil is not in good condition when it is hard and crusted on\r\ntop. The crust may be the cause of wasting water, it keeps out the air,\r\nand in general it is an uncongenial physical condition; but its\r\nevaporation of water is probably its chief defect. Instead of pouring\r\nwater on the land, therefore, we first attempt to keep the moisture in\r\nthe land. If, however, the soil becomes so dry in spite of you that the\r\nplants do not thrive, then water the bed. Do not _sprinkle_ it, but\r\n_water_ it. Wet it clear through at evening. Then in the morning, when\r\nthe earth begins to dry, loosen the surface again to keep the water\r\nfrom getting away. Sprinkling the plants every day or two is one of the\r\nsurest ways of spoiling them. We may water the ground with a\r\ngarden-rake.\r\n\r\n_Hand tools for weeding and subsequent tillage and other hand work._\r\n\r\nAny of the cultivators and wheel-hoes are as useful for the subsequent\r\ntilling of the crop as for the initial preparation of the land, but\r\nthere are other tools also that greatly facilitate the keeping of the\r\nplantation in order. Yet wholly aside from the value of a tool as an\r\nimplement of tillage and as a weapon for the pursuit of weeds, is its\r\nmerit merely as a shapely and interesting instrument. A man will take\r\ninfinite pains to choose a gun or a fishing-rod to his liking, and a\r\nwoman gives her best attention to the selecting of an umbrella; but a\r\nhoe is only a hoe and a rake only a rake. If one puts his personal\r\nchoice into the securing of plants for a garden, so should he\r\ndiscriminate in the choice of hand tools, to secure those that are\r\nlight, trim, well made, and precisely adapted to the work to be\r\naccomplished. A case of neat garden tools ought to be a great joy to a\r\njoyful gardener. So I am willing to enlarge on the subject of hoes and\r\ntheir kind.\r\n\r\nThe hoe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 95. Useful forms of hoe-blades.]\r\n\r\nThe common rectangular-bladed hoe is so thoroughly established in the\r\npopular mind that it is very difficult to introduce new patterns, even\r\nthough they may be intrinsically superior. As a general-purpose tool,\r\nit is no doubt true that a common hoe is better than any of its\r\nmodifications, but there are various patterns of hoe-blades that are\r\ngreatly superior for special uses, and which ought to appeal to any\r\nquiet soul who loves a garden.\r\n\r\nThe great width of the common blade does not admit of its being used in\r\nvery narrow rows or very close to delicate plants, and it does not\r\nallow of the deep stirring of the soil in narrow spaces. It is also\r\ndifficult to enter hard ground with such a broad face. Various pointed\r\nblades have been introduced from time to time, and most of them have\r\nmerit. Some persons prefer two points to the hoe, as shown in Marvin’s\r\nblades, in Fig. 95. These interesting shapes represent the suggestions\r\nof gardeners who will not be bound by what the market affords, but who\r\nhave blades cut and fitted for their own satisfaction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96. A stack of gardening weapons, comprising some\r\nof Tarryer’s weeding spuds and thimbles.]\r\n\r\nPersons who followed the entertaining writings of one who called\r\nhimself Mr. A.B. Tarryer, in “American Garden,” a few years back, will\r\nrecall the great variety of implements that he advised for the purpose\r\nof extirpating his hereditary foes, the weeds. A variety of these\r\nblades and tools is shown in Figs. 96 and 97. I shall let Mr. Tarryer\r\ntell his story at some length in order to lead my reader painlessly\r\ninto a new field of gardening pleasures.\r\n\r\nMr. Tarryer contends that the wheel-hoe is much too clumsy an affair to\r\nallow of the pursuit of an individual weed. While the operator is busy\r\nadjusting his machine and manipulating it about the corners of the\r\ngarden, the quack-grass has escaped over the fence or has gone to seed\r\nat the other end of the plantation. He devised an expeditious tool for\r\neach little work to be performed on the garden,—for hard ground and\r\nsoft, for old weeds and young (one of his implements was denominated\r\n“infant-damnation”).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97. Some of the details of the Tarryer tools.]\r\n\r\n“Scores of times during the season,” Mr. Tarryer writes, “the ten or\r\nfifteen minutes one has to enjoy in the flower, fruit, and vegetable\r\ngarden—and that would suffice for the needful weeding with the hoes we\r\nare celebrating—would be lost in harnessing horses or adjusting and\r\noiling squeaky wheel-hoes, even if everybody had them. The ‘American\r\nGarden’ is not big enough, nor my patience long enough, to give more\r\nthan an inkling of the unspeakable merits of these weapons of society\r\nand civilization. When Mrs. Tarryer was showing twelve or fifteen acres\r\nof garden with never a weed to be seen, she valued her dozen or more of\r\nthese light implements at five or ten dollars daily; whether they were\r\nin actual use or adorning the front hall, like a hunter’s or angler’s\r\nfurniture, made no difference. But where are these millennial tools\r\nmade and sold? Nowhere. They are as unknown as the Bible was in the\r\ndark ages, and we must give a few hints towards manufacturing them.\r\n\r\n“First, about the handles. The ordinary dealer or workman may say these\r\nknobs can be formed on any handles by winding them with leather; but\r\njust fancy a young maiden setting up her hoe meditatively and resting\r\nher hands and chin upon an old leather knob to reflect upon something\r\nthat has been said to her in the garden, and we shall perceive that a\r\nknob by some other name would smell far sweeter. Moreover, trees grow\r\nlarge enough at the butt to furnish all the knobs we want—even for\r\nbroom-sticks—though sawyers, turners, dealers, and the public seem not\r\nto be aware of it; yet it must be confessed we are so far gone in\r\ndepravity that there will be trouble in getting those handles....\r\n\r\n“In a broadcast prayer of this public nature, absolute specifications\r\nwould not be polite. Black walnut and butternut are fragrant as well as\r\nbeautiful timber. Cherry is stiff, heavy, durable, and, like maple,\r\ntakes a slippery polish. For fine, light handles, that the palm will\r\nstick to, butt cuts of poplar or cottonwood cannot be excelled, yet\r\nstraight-grained ash will bear more careless usage.\r\n\r\n“The handles of Mrs. Tarryer’s hoes are never perfectly straight. All\r\nthe bayonet class bend downward in use half an inch or more; all the\r\nthrust-hoe handles bend up in a regular curve (like a fiddle-bow turned\r\nover) two or three inches. Unless they are hung right, these hoes are\r\nvery awkward things. When perfectly fit for one, they may not fit\r\nanother; that is, a tall, keen-sighted person cannot use the hoe that\r\nis just fit for a very short one.... Curves in the handles throw\r\ncenters of gravity where they belong. Good timber generally warps in a\r\nhandle about right, only implement makers and babes in weeding may not\r\nknow when it is made fast right side up in the hoe.\r\n\r\n“There are plenty of thrust-hoes in market, such as they are. Some have\r\nmalleable iron sockets and bows—heavier to the buyer and cheaper to the\r\ndealer—instead of wrought-iron and steel, such as is required for true\r\nworth.”\r\n\r\nScarifiers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 98. A scarifier.]\r\n[Illustration: 99. Home-made scarifier.]\r\n[Illustration: 100. Home-made scarifier or scraper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 101. The common scarifier.]\r\n\r\nFor many purposes, tools that scrape or scarify the surface are\r\npreferable to hoes that dig up the ground. Weeds may be kept down by\r\ncutting them off, as in walks and often in flower-beds, rather than by\r\nrooting them out. Figure 98 shows such a tool, and a home-made\r\nimplement answering the same purpose is illustrated in Fig. 99. This\r\nlatter tool is easily made from strong band-iron. Another type is\r\nsuggested in Fig. 100, representing a slicing-hoe made by fastening a\r\nsheet of good metal to the tines of a broken fork. The kind chiefly in\r\nthe market is shown in Fig. 101.\r\n\r\nHand-weeders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 102. Good hand-weeders.]\r\n[Illustration: 103. A hand-weeder.]\r\n[Illustration: 104. A finger-weeder.]\r\n[Illustration: 105. A small hand-weeder.]\r\n\r\nFor small beds of flowers or vegetables, hand-weeders of various\r\npatterns are essential to easy and efficient work. One of the best\r\npatterns, with long and short handles, is shown in Fig. 102. Another\r\nstyle, that may be made at home of hoop-iron, is drawn in Fig. 103. A\r\nfinger-weeder is illustrated in Fig. 104. In Fig. 105 a common form is\r\nshown. Many patterns of hand-weeders are in the market, and other forms\r\nwill suggest themselves to the operator.\r\n\r\nTrowels and their kind.\r\n\r\nSmall hand-tools for digging, as trowels, dibbers, and spuds, may be\r\nhad of dealers. In buying a trowel it is economy to pay an extra price\r\nand secure a steel blade with a strong shank that runs through the\r\nentire length of the handle. One of these tools will last several years\r\nand may be used in hard ground, but the cheap trowels are generally\r\nhardly worth the buying. A solid wrought-iron trowel all in one piece\r\nis also manufactured, and is the most durable pattern. A steel trowel\r\nmay be secured to a long handle; or the blade of a broken trowel may be\r\nutilized in the same way (Fig. 106). A very good trowel may also be\r\nmade from a discarded blade of a mowing machine (Fig. 107), and it\r\nanswers the purpose of a hand-weeder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106. Long-handled trowel.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107. Improvised trowel.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108. Weed-spud.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109. A good weed-spud.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110. Weed-cutter.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111. A weed-spud that lifts the weed.]\r\n\r\nWeed-spuds are shown in Figs. 108 to 111. The first is particularly\r\nserviceable in cutting docks and other strong weeds from lawns and\r\npastures. It is provided with a brace to allow it to be thrust into the\r\nground with the foot. It is seldom necessary to dig out perennial weeds\r\nto the tips of their deep roots, if the crown is severed a short\r\ndistance below the surface.\r\n\r\nRollers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112. Hand-roller.] [Illustration: Fig. 113. Roller\r\nand marker.]\r\n\r\nIt is often essential that the land be compacted after it has been\r\nspaded or hoed, and some kind of hand-roller is then useful. Very\r\nefficient iron rollers are in the market, but a good one can be made\r\nfrom a hard chestnut or oak log, as shown in Fig. 112. (It should be\r\nremembered that when the surface is hard and compact, water escapes\r\nfrom it rapidly, and plants may suffer for moisture on arrival of warm\r\nweather.) The roller is useful in two ways—to compact the\r\nunder-surface, in which case the surface should be again loosened as\r\nsoon as the rolling is done; and to firm the earth about seeds (page\r\n98) or the roots of newly set plants.\r\n\r\nMarkers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114. Roller and marker.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 115. Marking-stick.]\r\n\r\nA marker may often be combined with the roller to good advantage, as in\r\nFig. 113. Ropes are secured about the cylinder at proper intervals, and\r\nthese mark the rows. Knots may be placed in the ropes to indicate the\r\nplaces where plants are to be set or seeds dropped. An extension of the\r\nsame idea is seen in Fig. 114, which shows iron or wooden pegs that\r\nmake holes in which very small plants may be set. An L-shaped rod\r\nprojects at one side to mark the place of the next row.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116. Tool for spacing plants.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117. Barrow rigged with a marker.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118. Hand sled-marker.]\r\n\r\nIn most cases the best and most expeditious method of marking out the\r\ngarden is by the use of the garden line, which is secured to a reel\r\n(Fig. 96), but various other devices are often useful. For very small\r\nbeds, drills or furrows may be made by a simple marking-stick (Fig.\r\n115). A handy marker is shown in Fig. 116. A marker can be rigged to a\r\nwheel-barrow, as in Fig. 117. A rod is secured underneath the front\r\ntruss, and from its end an adjustable trailer, B, is hung. The wheel of\r\nthe barrow marks the row, and the trailer indicates the place of the\r\nnext row, thereby keeping the rows parallel. A hand sled-marker is\r\nshown in Fig. 118, and a similar device may be secured to the frame of\r\na sulky cultivator (Fig. 119) or other wheel tool. A good adjustable\r\nsled-marker is outlined in Fig. 120.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119. Trailing sled-marker.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120. Adjustable sled-marker.]\r\n\r\n_Enriching the land_.\r\n\r\nTwo problems are involved in the fertilizing of the land: the direct\r\naddition of plant-food, and the improvement of the physical structure\r\nof the soil. The latter office is often the more important.\r\n\r\nLands that, on the one hand, are very hard and solid, with a tendency\r\nto bake, and, on the other, that are loose and leachy, are very greatly\r\nbenefited by the addition of organic matter. When this organic\r\nmatter—as animal and plant remains—decays and becomes thoroughly\r\nincorporated with the soil, it forms what is called humus. The addition\r\nof this humus makes the land mellow, friable, retentive of moisture,\r\nand promotes the general chemical activities of the soil. It also puts\r\nthe soil in the best physical condition for the comfort and well-being\r\nof the plants. Very many of the lands that are said to be exhausted of\r\nplant-food still contain enough potash, phosphoric acid, and lime, and\r\nother fertilizing elements, to produce good crops; but they have been\r\ngreatly injured in their physical condition by long-continued cropping,\r\ninjudicious tillage, and the withholding of vegetable matter. A part of\r\nthe marked results secured from the plowing under of clover is due to\r\nthe incorporation of vegetable matter, wholly aside from the addition\r\nof fertilizing material; and this is emphatically true of clover\r\nbecause its deep-growing roots penetrate and break up the subsoil.\r\n\r\nMuck and leafmold are often very useful in ameliorating either very\r\nhard or very loose lands. Excellent humous material may be constantly\r\nat hand if the leaves, garden refuse, and some of the manure are piled\r\nand composted (p. 114). If the pile is turned several times a year, the\r\nmaterial becomes fine and uniform in texture.\r\n\r\nThe various questions associated with the fertilizing of the land are\r\ntoo large to be considered in detail here. Persons who desire to\r\nfamiliarize themselves with the subject should consult recent books. It\r\nmay be said, however, that, as a rule, most lands contain all the\r\nelements of plant-food in sufficient quantities except potash,\r\nphosphoric acid, and nitrogen. In many cases, lime is very beneficial\r\nto land, usually because it corrects acidity and has a mechanical\r\neffect in pulverizing and flocculating clay and in cementing sands.\r\n\r\nThe chief sources of commercial potash are muriate of potash, sulfate\r\nof potash, and wood ashes. For general purposes, the muriate of potash\r\nis now recommended, because it is comparatively cheap and the\r\ncomposition is uniform. A normal application of muriate of potash is\r\n200 to 300 pounds to the acre; but on some lands, where the greatest\r\nresults are demanded, sometimes as much as twice this application may\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid is got in dissolved South Carolina and Florida rock and\r\nin various bone preparations. These materials are applied at the rate\r\nof 200 to 400 pounds to the acre.\r\n\r\nCommercial nitrogen is secured chiefly in the form of animal refuse, as\r\nblood and tankage, and in nitrate of soda. It is more likely to be lost\r\nby leaching through the land than the mineral substances are,\r\nespecially if the land lacks humus. Nitrate of soda is very soluble,\r\nand should be applied in small quantities at intervals. Nitrogen, being\r\nthe element which is mostly conducive to vegetative growth, tends to\r\ndelay the season of maturity if applied heavily or late in the season.\r\nFrom 100 to 300 pounds of nitrate of soda may be applied to the acre,\r\nbut it is ordinarily better to make two or three applications at\r\nintervals of three to six weeks. Fertilizing materials may be applied\r\neither in fall or spring; but in the case of nitrate of soda it is\r\nusually better not to apply in the fall unless the land has plenty of\r\nhumus to prevent leaching, or on plants that start very early in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nFertilizing material is sown broadcast, or it may be scattered lightly\r\nin furrows underneath the seeds, and then covered with earth. If sown\r\nbroadcast, it may be applied either after the seeds are sown or before.\r\nIt is usually better to apply it before, for although the rains carry\r\nit down, nevertheless the upward movement of water during the dry\r\nweather of the summer tends to bring it back to the surface. It is\r\nimportant that large lumps of fertilizer, especially muriate of potash\r\nand nitrate of soda, do not fall near the crowns of the plants;\r\notherwise the plants may be seriously injured. It is a general\r\nprinciple, also, that it is best to use more sparingly of fertilizers\r\nthan of tillage. The tendency is to make fertilizers do penance for the\r\nsins of neglect, but the results do not often meet one’s expectations.\r\n\r\nIf one has only a small garden or a home yard, it ordinarily will not\r\npay him to buy the chemicals separately, as suggested above, but he may\r\npurchase a complete fertilizer that is sold under a trademark or brand,\r\nand has a guaranteed analysis. If one is raising plants chiefly for\r\ntheir foliage, as rhubarb and ornamental bushes, he should choose a\r\nfertilizer comparatively rich in nitrogen; but if he desires chiefly\r\nfruit and flowers, the mineral elements, as potash and phosphoric acid,\r\nshould usually be high. If one uses the chemicals, it is not necessary\r\nthat they be mixed before application; in fact, it is usually better\r\nnot to mix them, because some plants and some soils need more of one\r\nelement than of another. Just what materials, and how much, different\r\nsoils and plants require must be determined by the grower himself by\r\nobservation and experiment; and it is one of the satisfactions of\r\ngardening to arrive at discrimination in such matters.\r\n\r\nMuriate of potash costs $40 and upwards per ton, sulfate about $48,\r\ndissolved boneblack about $24, ground bone about $30, kainit about $13,\r\nand nitrate of soda about 2-1/4 cents per pound. These prices vary, of\r\ncourse, with the composition or mechanical condition of materials, and\r\nwith the state of the market. The average composition of unleached wood\r\nashes in the market is about as follows: Potash, 5.2 per cent;\r\nphosphoric acid, 1.70 per cent; lime, 34 per cent; magnesia, 3.40 per\r\ncent. The average composition of kainit is 13.54 per cent potash, 1.15\r\nper cent lime.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the soil itself is the greatest storehouse of plant-food\r\nis shown by the following average of thirty-five analyses of the total\r\ncontent of the first eight inches of surface soils, per acre: 3521\r\npounds of nitrogen, 4400 pounds of phosphoric acid, 19,836 pounds of\r\npotash. Much of this is unavailable, but good tillage, green-manuring,\r\nand proper management tend to unlock it and at the same time to save it\r\nfrom waste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 121. A good cart for collecting leaves and other\r\nmaterials.]\r\n\r\nEvery careful gardener will take satisfaction in saving leaves and\r\ntrimmings and stable refuse and making compost of it to supplement the\r\nnative supplies in the soil. Some out-of-the-way corner will be found\r\nfor a permanent pile, with room for piling it over from time to time.\r\nThe pile will be screened by his garden planting. (Figure 121 suggests\r\na useful cart for collecting such materials.) He will also save the\r\npower of his land by changing his crops to other parts of the garden,\r\nyear by year, not growing his China asters or his snap-dragons or his\r\npotatoes or strawberries continuously on the same area; and thus, also,\r\nwill his garden have a new face every year.\r\n\r\nLest the reader may get the idea that there is no limit to be placed on\r\nthe enriching of the soil, I will caution him at the end of my\r\ndiscussion that he may easily make the place so rich that some plants\r\nwill overgrow and will not come into flowering or fruiting before\r\nfrost, and flowers may lack brilliancy. On very rich land, scarlet sage\r\nwill grow to great size but will not bloom in the northern season;\r\nsweet peas will run to vine; gaillardias and some other plants will\r\nbreak down; tomatoes and melons and peppers may be so late that the\r\nfruit will not ripen. Only experience and good judgment will safeguard\r\nthe gardener as to how far he should or should not go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE HANDLING OF THE PLANTS\r\n\r\nThere is a knack in the successful handling of plants that it is\r\nimpossible to describe in print. All persons can improve their practice\r\nthrough diligent reading of useful gardening literature, but no amount\r\nof reading and advice will make a good gardener of a person who does\r\nnot love to dig in a garden or who does not have a care for plants just\r\nbecause they are plants.\r\n\r\nTo grow a plant well, one must learn its natural habits. Some persons\r\nlearn this as if by intuition, acquiring the knowledge from close\r\ndiscrimination of the behavior of the plant. Often they are themselves\r\nunconscious of this knack of knowing what will make the plant to\r\nthrive; but it is not at all necessary to have such an intuitive\r\njudgment to enable one to be even more than a fairly good gardener.\r\nDiligent attention to the plant’s habits and requirements, and a real\r\nregard for the plant’s welfare, will make any person a successful\r\nplant-grower.\r\n\r\nSome of the things that a person should know about any plant he would\r\ngrow are these:—\r\n\r\nWhether the plant matures in the first, second, third, or subsequent\r\nyears; and when it naturally begins to fail.\r\n\r\nThe time of the year or season in which it normally grows, blooms, or\r\nfruits; and whether it can be forced at other seasons.\r\n\r\nWhether it prefers a situation dry or moist or wet, hot or cool, sunny\r\nor shady.\r\n\r\nIts preferences as to soil, whether very rich or only moderately rich,\r\nsand or loam, or peat or clay.\r\n\r\nIts hardiness as to frost, wind, drought, heat.\r\n\r\nWhether it has any special requirements as to germination, and whether\r\nit transplants well.\r\n\r\nWhether it is specially liable to attack by insects or disease.\r\n\r\nWhether it has a special inability to grow two years in succession on\r\nthe same land.\r\n\r\nHaving suited the situation to the plant, and having prepared the\r\nground well and made a resolution to keep it well, special attention\r\nmust be given to such matters as these:—\r\n\r\nGuarding from all insects and diseases; and also from cats and chickens\r\nand dogs; and likewise from rabbits and mice.\r\n\r\nProtecting from weeds.\r\n\r\nPruning, in the case of fruit trees and bushes, and also of ornamental\r\nwoody plants on occasion, and sometimes even of annual herbs.\r\n\r\nStaking and tying, particularly of sprawly garden flowers.\r\n\r\nPersistent picking of seed pods or dead flowers from flower plants, in\r\norder to conserve the strength of the plant and to prolong its season\r\nof bloom.\r\n\r\nWatering in dry weather (but not sprinkling or dribbling).\r\n\r\nThorough winter protecting of plants that need it.\r\n\r\nRemoving dead leaves, broken branches, weak and sickly plants, and\r\notherwise keeping the place tidy and trim.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sowing the seeds_.\r\n\r\nPrepare the surface earth well, to make a good seed-bed. Plant when the\r\nground is moist, if possible, and preferably just before a rain if the\r\nsoil is of such character that it will not bake. For shallow-planted\r\nseeds, firm the earth above them by walking over the row or by patting\r\nit down with a hoe. Special care should be exercised not to sow very\r\nsmall and slow-germinating seeds, as celery, carrot, onion, in poorly\r\nprepared soil or in ground that bakes. With such seeds it is well to\r\nsow seeds of radish or turnip, for these germinate quickly and break\r\nthe crust, and also mark the row so that tillage may be begun before\r\nthe regular-crop seeds are up.\r\n\r\nLand may be prevented from baking over the seeds by scattering a very\r\nthin layer of fine litter, as chaff, or of sifted moss or mold, over\r\nthe row. A board is sometimes laid on the row to retain the moisture,\r\nbut it must be lifted gradually just as soon as the plants begin to\r\nbreak the ground, or the plants will be greatly injured. Whenever\r\npracticable, seed-beds of celery and other slow-germinating seeds\r\nshould be shaded. If the beds are watered, be careful that the soil is\r\nnot packed by the force of the water or baked by the sun. In thickly\r\nsown seed-beds, thin or transplant the plants as soon as they have made\r\ntheir first true leaves.\r\n\r\nFor most home-grounds, seeds may be sown by hand, but for large areas\r\nof one crop, one of the many kinds of seed-sowers may be used. The\r\nparticular methods of sowing seeds are usually specified in the seed\r\ncatalogues, if other than ordinary treatment is required. The\r\nsled-markers (already described, p. 108) open a furrow of sufficient\r\ndepth for the planting of most seeds. If marker furrows are not\r\navailable, a furrow may be opened with a hoe for such deep-planted\r\nseeds as peas and sweet peas, or by a trowel or end of a rakestale for\r\nsmaller seeds. In narrow beds or boxes, a stick or ruler (Fig. 115) may\r\nbe used for opening creases to receive the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe depth at which seeds are to be planted varies with the kind, the\r\nsoil and its preparation, the season, and whether they are planted in\r\nthe open or in the house. In boxes and under glass, it is a good rule\r\nthat the seed be sown at a depth equal to twice its own diameter, but\r\ndeeper sowing is usually necessary out of doors, particularly in hot\r\nand dry weather. Strong and hardy seeds, as peas, sweet peas, large\r\nfruit-tree seeds, may be planted three to six inches deep. Tender\r\nseeds, that are injured by cold and wet, may be planted after the\r\nground is settled and warm at a greater depth than before that season.\r\nAs a rule, nothing is gained by sowing tender seeds before the weather\r\nis thoroughly settled and the ground warm.\r\n\r\n_Propagating by cuttings_.\r\n\r\nMany common plants are propagated by cuttings rather than by seeds,\r\nparticularly when it is desired to increase a particular variety.\r\n\r\nCuttings are parts of plants inserted in soil or water with the\r\nintention that they shall grow and make new plants. They are of various\r\nkinds. They may be classified, with reference to the age of the wood or\r\ntissue, into two classes; viz. those made from perfectly hard or\r\ndormant wood (taken from the winter twigs of trees and bushes), and\r\nthose made from more or less immature or growing wood. They may be\r\nclassified again in respect to the part of the plants from which they\r\nare taken, as root-cuttings, tuber-cuttings (as the ordinary “seed”\r\nplanted for potatoes), stem-cuttings, and leaf-cuttings.\r\n\r\nDormant stem-cuttings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122. The planting of the dormant-wood cuttings.]\r\n\r\nDormant-wood cuttings are used for grapes (Fig. 122), currants,\r\ngooseberries, willows, poplars, and many other kinds of soft-wooded\r\ntrees and shrubs. Such cuttings are ordinarily taken in fall or winter,\r\nbut cut into the proper lengths and then buried in sand or moss where\r\nthey do not freeze, in order that the lower end may heal over or\r\ncallous. In the spring these cuttings are set in the ground, preferably\r\nin a rather sandy and well-drained place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123. Carnation cutting.]\r\n\r\nUsually, hardwood cuttings are made with two to four joints or buds,\r\nand when they are planted, only the upper bud projects above the\r\nground. They may be planted erect, as Fig. 122 shows, or somewhat\r\nslanting. In order that the cutting may reach down to moist earth, it\r\nis desirable that it should not be less than 6 in. long; and it is\r\nsometimes better if it is 8 to 12 in. If the wood is short-jointed,\r\nthere may be several buds on a cutting of this length; and in order to\r\nprevent too many shoots from arising from these buds the lowermost buds\r\nare often cut out. Roots will start as readily if the lower buds are\r\nremoved, since the buds grow into shoots and not into roots.\r\n\r\nCuttings of currants, grapes, gooseberries, and the like may be set in\r\nrows that are far enough apart to admit of easy tillage either with\r\nhorse or hand tools, and the cuttings may be placed 3 to 8 in. apart in\r\nthe row. The English varieties of gooseberries, considerably grown in\r\nthis country, do not propagate readily from cuttings.\r\n\r\nAfter the cuttings have grown one season, the plants are usually\r\ntransplanted and given more room for the second year’s growth, after\r\nwhich time they are ready to be set in permanent plantations. In some\r\ncases, the plants are set at the end of the first year; but two-year\r\nplants are stronger and usually preferable.\r\n\r\nCuttings of roots.\r\n\r\nRoot-cuttings are used for blackberries, raspberries, and a few other\r\nthings. They are ordinarily made of roots from the size of a lead\r\npencil to one’s little finger, and are cut in lengths from 3 to 5 in.\r\nlong. The cuttings are stored the same as stem-cuttings and allowed to\r\ncallous. In the spring they are planted in a horizontal or nearly\r\nhorizontal position in moist sandy soil, being entirely covered to a\r\ndepth of 1 or 2 in.\r\n\r\nGreen cuttings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124. Verbena cutting.]\r\n\r\nSoftwood or greenwood cuttings are usually made of wood that is mature\r\nenough to break when it is bent sharply. When the wood is so soft that\r\nit will bend and not break, it is too immature, in the majority of\r\nplants, for the making of good cuttings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125. Leaf-cutting.]\r\n\r\nOne to two joints is the proper length of a greenwood cutting. If of\r\ntwo joints, the lower leaves should be cut off and the upper leaves cut\r\nin two so that they do not present their entire surface to the air and\r\nthereby evaporate the plant juices too rapidly. If the cutting is of\r\nonly one joint, the lower end is usually cut just above a joint. In\r\neither case, the cuttings are usually inserted in sand or well-washed\r\ngravel, nearly or quite up to the leaves. Keep the bed uniformly moist\r\nthroughout its depth, but avoid any soil which holds so much moisture\r\nthat it becomes muddy and sour. These cuttings should be shaded until\r\nthey begin to emit their roots. Coleus, geraniums, fuchsias,\r\ncarnations, and nearly all the common greenhouse and house plants, are\r\npropagated by these cuttings or slips (Figs. 123, 124).\r\n\r\nCuttings of leaves.\r\n\r\nLeaf-cuttings are often used for the fancy-leaved begonias, gloxinias,\r\nand a few other plants. The young plant usually arises most readily\r\nfrom the leaf-stalk or petiole. The leaf, therefore, is inserted into\r\nthe ground much as a green cutting is. Begonia leaves will throw out\r\nyoung plants from the main ribs when these veins or ribs are cut.\r\nTherefore, well-grown and firm begonia leaves are sometimes laid flat\r\non the sand and the main veins cut; then the leaf is weighted down with\r\npebbles or pegs so that these cut surfaces come into intimate contact\r\nwith the soil beneath. The usual way, however, is to cut a triangular\r\npiece of the leaf (Fig. 125) and insert the tip in sand. So long as the\r\ncutting is alive, do not be discouraged, even if it do not start.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. A well-planted entrance. Common trees and bushes, with Boston ivy\r\non the post, and _Berberis Thunbergii_ in front. VIII. A well-planted\r\nentrance. Common trees and bushes, with Boston ivy on the post, and\r\n_Berberis Thunbergii_ in front.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral treatment of cuttings.\r\n\r\nIn the growing of all greenwood and leaf-cuttings, it is well to\r\nremember that they should have a gentle bottom heat; the soil should be\r\nsuch that it will hold moisture and yet not remain wet; the air about\r\nthe tops should not become close and stagnant, else the plants will\r\ndamp off; and the tops should be shaded for a time. In order to control\r\nall the conditions, such cuttings are grown under cover, as in a\r\ngreenhouse, coldframe, or a box in the residence window.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126. Cuttings inserted in a double pot.]\r\n\r\nAn excellent method of starting cuttings in the living room is to make\r\na double pot, as shown in Fig. 126. Inside a 6-in. pot set a 4-in. pot.\r\nFill the bottom, _a_, with gravel or bits of brick, for drainage. Plug\r\nthe hole in the inside pot. Fill the spaces between, _c_, with earth,\r\nand in this set the cuttings. Water may be poured into the inner pot,\r\n_b_, to supply the moisture.\r\n\r\n_Transplanting young seedlings_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127. To check evaporation at transplanting.]\r\n\r\nIn the transplanting of cabbages, tomatoes, flowers, and all plants\r\nrecently started from seeds, it is important that the ground be\r\nthoroughly fined and compacted. Plants usually live better if\r\ntransplanted into ground that has been freshly turned. If possible,\r\ntransplant in cloudy or rainy weather, particularly if late in the\r\nseason. Firm the earth snugly about the roots with the hands or feet,\r\nin order to bring up the soil moisture; but it is generally best to\r\nrake the surface in order to reëstablish the earth-mulch, unless the\r\nplants are so small that their roots cannot reach through the mulch (p.\r\n98).\r\n\r\nIf the plants are taken from pots, water the pots some time in advance,\r\nand the ball of earth will fall out when the pot is inverted and tapped\r\nlightly. In taking up plants from the ground, it is advisable, also, to\r\nwater them well some time before removing; the earth may then be held\r\non the roots. See that the watering is done far enough in advance to\r\nallow the water to settle away and distribute itself; the earth should\r\nnot be muddy when the plants are removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128. Plants sheared and not sheared when\r\ntransplanted.]\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the evaporation from the plant, shingles may be\r\nstuck into the ground to shade the plant; or a screen may be improvised\r\nwith pieces of paper (Fig. 122), tin cans, inverted flower-pots,\r\ncoverings of brush, or other means.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129. Where to shear the tops of young plants.]\r\n\r\nIt is nearly always advisable to remove some of the foliage,\r\nparticularly if the plant has several leaves and if it has not been\r\ngrown in a pot, and also if the transplanting is done in warm weather.\r\nFigure 128 shows a good treatment for transplanted plants. With the\r\nfoliage all left on, the plants are likely to behave as in the upper\r\nrow; but with most of it cut off, as in the lower row, there is little\r\nwilting, and new leaves soon start. Figure 129 also shows what part of\r\nthe leaves may be cut off on transplanting. If the ground is freshly\r\nturned and the transplanting is well done, it rarely will be necessary\r\nto water the plants; but if watering is necessary, it should be done at\r\nnightfall, and the surface should be loosened the next morning or as\r\nsoon as it becomes dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130. Trowel dibber.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131. The dibber.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132. Home-made padded dibber.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133. Dibber and crow-bar combined.]\r\n\r\nIn the transplanting of young plants, some kind of a dibber should be\r\nused to make the holes. Dibbers make holes without removing any of the\r\nearth. A good form of dibber is shown in Fig. 130, which is like a flat\r\nor plane trowel. Many persons prefer a cylindrical and conical dibber,\r\nlike that shown in Fig. 131. For hard soils and larger plants, a strong\r\ndibber may be made from a limb that has a right-angled branch to serve\r\nas a handle. This handle may be softened by slipping a piece of rubber\r\nhose on it (Fig. 132). A long iron dibber, which may also be used as a\r\ncrow-bar, is shown in Fig. 133. In transplanting with the dibber, a\r\nhole is first made by a thrust of the tool, and the earth is then\r\npressed against the root by means of the foot, hand, or the dibber\r\nitself (as in Fig. 131). The hole is not filled by putting in dirt at\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134. Strawberry planter.]\r\n\r\nFor large plants, a broader dibber may be used. An implement like that\r\nshown in Fig. 134 is useful for setting strawberries and other plants\r\nwith large roots. It is made of two-inch plank, with a block on top to\r\nact as foot-rest and to prevent the blade from going too deep. In order\r\nto provide space for the foot and easily to direct the thrust, the\r\nhandle may be placed at one side of the middle. For plunging pots, a\r\ndibber like that shown in Fig. 135 is useful, particularly when the\r\nsoil is so hard that a long-pointed tool is necessary. The bottom of\r\nthe hole may be filled with earth before the pot is inserted; but it is\r\noften advisable to leave the vacant space below (as in _b_) to provide\r\ndrainage, to keep the plant from rooting, and to prevent earth-worms\r\nfrom entering the hole in the bottom of the pot. For smaller pots, the\r\ntool may be inserted a less depth (as at _c_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 135. The plunging of pots.]\r\n\r\n_Transplanting established plants and trees_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136. Setting large tub-plants in the lawn.]\r\n\r\nIn setting potted plants out of doors, it is nearly always advisable to\r\nplunge them,—that is to set the pots into the earth,—unless the place\r\nis very wet. The pots are then watered by the rainfall, and demand\r\nlittle care. If the plants are to be returned to the house in the fall,\r\nthey should not be allowed to root through the hole in the pot, and the\r\nrooting may be prevented by turning the pot around every few days.\r\nLarge decorative plants may be made to look as if growing naturally in\r\nthe lawn by sinking the pot or box just below the surface and rolling\r\nthe sod over it, as suggested in Fig. 136. A space around and below the\r\ntub may be provided to insure drainage.\r\n\r\nTub-plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137. Plant-box with a movable side.]\r\n\r\nFor the shifting of very large tub-plants, a box or tub with movable\r\nsides, as in Fig. 137, is handy and efficient. The plant-box\r\nrecommended to parties who grew plants for exhibition at the World’s\r\nFair is shown in Fig. 138. It is made of strong boards or planks. At A\r\nis shown the inside of one of two opposite sections or sides, four feet\r\nwide at top, three feet wide at bottom, and three feet high. The cleats\r\nare two-by-four scantlings, through which holes are bored to admit the\r\nbolts with which the box is to be held together. B is an outside view\r\nof one of the alternating sections, three feet four inches wide at top,\r\ntwo feet four inches at bottom, and three feet deep. A one-by-six strip\r\nis nailed through the center to give strength. C is an end view of A,\r\nshowing the bolts and also a two-by-four cleat to which the bottom is\r\nto be nailed. This box was used mostly for transporting large growing\r\nstock to the exposition, the stock having been dug from the open and\r\nthe box secured around the ball of earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138. Box for transporting large transplanted\r\nstock.]\r\n\r\nWhen to transplant.\r\n\r\nIn general, it is best to set hardy plants in the fall, particularly if\r\nthe ground is fairly dry and the exposure is not too bleak. To this\r\nclass belong most of the fruit trees and ornamental trees and shrubs;\r\nalso hardy herbs, as columbines, peonies, lilies, bleeding-hearts, and\r\nthe like. They should be planted as soon as they are thoroughly mature,\r\nso that the leaves begin to fall naturally. If any leaves remain on the\r\ntree or bush at planting time, strip them off, unless the plant is an\r\nevergreen. It is generally best not to cut back fall-planted trees to\r\nthe full extent desired, but to shorten them three-fourths of the\r\nrequired amount in the fall, and take off the remaining fourth in the\r\nspring, so that no dead or dry tips are left on the plant. Evergreens,\r\nas pines and spruces, are not headed-in much, and usually not at all.\r\n\r\nAll tender and very small plants should be set in the spring, in which\r\ncase very early planting is desirable; and spring planting is always to\r\nbe advised when the ground is not thoroughly drained and well prepared.\r\n\r\nDepth to transplant.\r\n\r\nIn well-compacted land, trees and shrubs should be set at about the\r\nsame depth as they stood in the nursery, but if the land has been\r\ndeeply trenched or if it is loose from other causes, the plants should\r\nbe set deeper, because the earth will probably settle. The hole should\r\nbe filled with fine surface earth. It is generally not advisable to\r\nplace manure in the hole, but if it is used, it should be of small\r\namount and very thoroughly mixed with the earth, else it will cause the\r\nsoil to dry out. In lawns and other places where surface tillage cannot\r\nbe given, a light mulch of litter or manure may be placed about the\r\nplants; but the earth-mulch (page 98), when it can be secured, is much\r\nthe best conserver of moisture.\r\n\r\nMaking the rows straight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139. A planting board.]\r\n\r\nIn order to set trees in rows, it is necessary to use a garden line\r\n(Fig. 96), or to mark out the ground with some of the devices already\r\ndescribed (Figs. 113-120); or in large areas, the place may be staked\r\nout. In planting orchards, the area is laid out (preferably by a\r\nsurveyor) with two or more rows of stakes so placed that a man may\r\nsight from one fixed point to another. Two or three men work to best\r\nadvantage in such planting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140. Device for placing the tree.]\r\n\r\nThere are various devices for locating the place of the stake after the\r\nstake has been removed and the hole dug, in case the area is not\r\nregularly staked out in such a way that sighting across the area may be\r\nemployed. One of the simplest is shown in Fig. 139. It is a narrow and\r\nthin board with a notch in the center and a peg in either end, one of\r\nthe pegs being stationary. The implement is so placed that the notch\r\nmeets the stake, then one end of it is thrown out of the way until the\r\nhole is dug. When the implement is brought again to its original\r\nposition, the notch mark’s the place of the stake and the tree. Figure\r\n140 is a device with a lid, in the end of which is a notch to mark the\r\nplace of the stake. This lid is thrown back, as shown by the dotted\r\nlines, when the hole is being dug. Figure 141 shows a method of\r\nbringing trees in row by measuring from a line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141. Lining a tree from a stake.]\r\n\r\nCutting-back; filling.\r\n\r\nIn the planting of any tree or bush, the roots should be cut back\r\nbeyond all breaks and serious bruises, and fine earth should be\r\nthoroughly filled in and firmed about them, as in Fig. 142. No\r\nimplement is so good as the fingers for working the soil about the\r\nroots. If the tree has many roots, work it up and down slightly several\r\ntimes during the filling of the hole, to settle the earth in place.\r\nWhen the earth is thrown in carelessly, the roots are jammed together,\r\nand often an empty place is left beneath the crown, as in Fig. 143,\r\nwhich causes the roots to dry out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142: Proper planting of a tree.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143: Careless planting of a tree.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144. Pruned young tree.] [Illustration: Fig. 145.\r\nPruned young tree.]\r\n\r\nThe marks on the tops of these trees in Figs. 142 and 143 show where\r\nthe branches may be cut. See also Fig. 152. Figures 144 and 145 show\r\nthe tops of trees after pruning. Strong branchy trees, as apples,\r\npears, and ornamental trees, are usually headed back in this way, upon\r\nplanting. If the tree has one straight leader and many or several\r\nslender branches (Fig. 146), it is usually pruned, as in Fig. 147, each\r\nbranch being cut back to one or two buds. If there are no branches, or\r\nvery few of them,—in which case there will be good buds upon the main\r\nstem,—the leader may be cut back a third or half its length, to a mere\r\nwhip. Ornamental bushes with long tops are usually cut back a third or\r\na half when set, as shown in Fig. 45.\r\n\r\nAlways leave a little of the small bud-making growth. The practice of\r\ncutting back shade trees to mere long clubs, or poles, with no small\r\ntwigs, is to be discouraged. The tree in such case is obliged to force\r\nout adventitious buds from the old wood, and it may not have vigor\r\nenough to do this; and the process may be so long delayed as to allow\r\nthe tree to be overtaken by drought before it gets a start.\r\n\r\nRemoving very large trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146: Peach tree.] [Illustration: Fig. 147: Peach\r\ntree pruned for planting.]\r\n\r\nVery large trees can often be moved with safety. It is essential that\r\nthe transplanting be done when the trees are perfectly dormant,—winter\r\nbeing preferable,—that a large mass of earth and roots be taken with\r\nthe tree, and that the top be vigorously cut back. Large trees are\r\noften moved in winter on a stone-boat, by securing a large ball of\r\nearth frozen about the roots. This frozen ball is secured by digging\r\nabout the tree for several days in succession, so that the freezing\r\nprogresses with the excavation. A good device for moving such trees is\r\nshown in Fig. 148. The trunk of the tree is securely wrapped with\r\nburlaps or other soft material, and a ring or chain is then secured\r\nabout it. A long pole, _b_, is run over the truck of a wagon and the\r\nend of it is secured to the chain or ring upon the tree. This pole is a\r\nlever for raising the tree out of the ground. A team is hitched at _a_,\r\nand a man holds the pole _b_. Other and more elaborate devices are in\r\nuse, but this explains the idea and is therefore sufficient for the\r\npresent purpose; for when a person desires to remove a very large tree\r\nhe should secure the services of an expert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148: Moving a large tree.]\r\n\r\nThe following more explicit directions for moving large trees are by\r\nEdward Hicks, who has had much experience in the business, and who made\r\nthis report to the press a few years ago: “In moving large trees, say\r\nthose ten to twelve inches in diameter and twenty-five to thirty feet\r\nhigh, it is well to prepare them by trimming and cutting or sawing off\r\nthe roots at a proper distance from the trunks, say six to eight feet,\r\nin June. The cut roots heal over and send out fibrous roots, which\r\nshould not be injured more than is necessary in moving the trees next\r\nfall or spring. Young, thrifty maples and elms, originally from the\r\nnursery, do not need such preparation nearly as much as other and older\r\ntrees. In moving a tree, we begin by digging a wide trench six to eight\r\nfeet from it, leaving all possible roots fast to it. By digging under\r\nthe tree in the wide trench, and working the soil out of the roots by\r\nmeans of round or dull-pointed sticks, the soil falls into the cavity\r\nmade under the tree. Three or four men in as many hours could get so\r\nmuch of the soil away from the roots that it would be safe to attach a\r\nrope and tackle to the upper part of the trunk and to some adjoining\r\npost or tree for the purpose of pulling the tree over. A good quantity\r\nof bagging must be put around the tree under the rope to prevent\r\ninjury, and care should be taken that the pulling of the rope does not\r\nsplit off or break a limb. A team is hitched to the end of the draft\r\nrope, and slowly driven in the proper direction to pull the tree over.\r\nIf the tree does not readily tip over, dig under and cut off any fast\r\nroot. While it is tipped over, work out more of the soil with the\r\nsticks. Now pass a large rope, double, around a few large roots close\r\nto the tree, leaving the ends of the rope turned up by the trunk to be\r\nused in lifting the tree at the proper time. Tip the tree in the\r\nopposite direction and put another large rope around the large roots\r\nclose to the trunk; remove more soil and see that no roots are fast to\r\nthe ground. Four guy-ropes attached to the upper parts of the tree, as\r\nshown in the cut (Fig. 149), should be put on properly and used to\r\nprevent the tree from tipping over too far as well as to keep it\r\nupright. A good deal of the soil can be put back in the hole without\r\ncovering the roots to get it out of the way of the machine. The latter\r\ncan now be placed about the tree by removing the front part, fastened\r\nby four bolts, placing the frame with the hind wheels around the tree\r\nand replacing the front parts. Two timbers, three-by-nine inches, and\r\ntwenty feet long, are now placed on the ground under the hind wheels,\r\nand in front of them, parallel to each other for the purpose of keeping\r\nthe hind wheels up out of the big hole when drawing the tree away; and\r\nthey are also used while backing the hind wheels across the new hole in\r\nwhich the tree is to be planted. The machine (Figs. 149, 150) consists\r\nof a hind axle twelve feet long, and broad-tired wheels. The frame is\r\nmade of spruce three-by-eight inches and twenty feet long. The braces\r\nare three-by-five inches and ten feet long, and upright three-by-nine\r\ninches and three feet high; these are bolted to the hind axle and main\r\nframe. The front axle has a set of blocks bolted together and of\r\nsufficient height to support the front end of the frame. Into the top\r\ntimbers, three-by-six inches, hollows are cut at the proper distances\r\nto receive the ends of two locust rollers. A windlass or winch is put\r\nat each end of the frame, by which trees can easily and steadily be\r\nlifted and lowered, the large double ropes passing over the rollers to\r\nthe windlasses. A locust boom is put across the machine under the frame\r\nand above the braces; iron pins hold it in place. The side guy-ropes\r\nare made fast to the ends of this boom. The other guy-ropes are made\r\nfast to the front and rear parts of the machine. Four rope loops are\r\nmade fast inside of the frame, and are so placed that by passing a rope\r\naround the trunk of the tree and through the loops two or three times,\r\na rope ring is made around the tree that will keep the trunk in the\r\nmiddle of the frame and not allow it to hit either the edges or the\r\nrollers—a very necessary safeguard. As the tree is slowly lifted by the\r\nwindlasses, the guy-ropes are loosened, as needed. The tree will pass\r\nobstructions, such as trees by the roadside, but in doing so it is\r\nbetter to lean the tree backward. When the tree has arrived at its new\r\nplace, the two timbers are placed along the opposite edges of the hole\r\nso that the hind wheels can be backed over it. The tree is then lowered\r\nto the proper depth, and made plumb by the guy-ropes, and good, mellow\r\nsoil is thrown in and packed well into all the cavities under the\r\nroots. When the hole is half filled, several barrels of water should be\r\npoured in; this will wash the soil into the cavities under the center\r\nof the tree much better. When the water has settled away, fill in and\r\npack the soil till the hole is little more than full. Leave a\r\ndepression, so that all the rain that may fall will be retained. The\r\ntree should now be judiciously trimmed and the machine removed. Five\r\nmen can take up, move, and plant a tree in a day, if the distance is\r\nshort and the digging not too hard. The tree should be properly wired\r\nto stakes to prevent the wind from blowing it over. The front part of\r\nthe machine is a part of our platform spring market-wagon, while the\r\nhind wheels are from a wood-axle wagon. A tree ten inches in diameter,\r\nwith some dirt adhering to its roots, will weigh a ton or more.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149. The tree ready to lift.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 150. The tree ready to move.]\r\n\r\n_Winter protection of plants_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151. Trees heeled-in for winter.]\r\n\r\nIf the ground is not ready for planting in the fall, or if it is\r\ndesired for any reason to delay until spring, the trees or bushes may\r\nbe heeled-in, as illustrated in Fig. 151. The roots are laid in a\r\nfurrow or trench, and are covered with well-firmed earth. Straw or\r\nmanure may be thrown over the earth still further to protect the roots,\r\nbut if it is thrown over the tops, mice may be attracted by it and the\r\ntrees be girdled. Tender trees or bushes may be lightly covered to the\r\ntips with earth. Plants should be heeled-in only in loose, warm, loamy\r\nor sandy ground and in a well-drained place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152. Tree earthed up for winter.]\r\n\r\nFall-planted trees should generally be mounded up, sometimes even as\r\nhigh as shown in Fig. 152. This hilling holds the plant in position,\r\ncarries off the water, prevents too deep freezing, and holds the earth\r\nfrom heaving. The mound is taken away in the spring. It is sometimes\r\nadvisable to mound-up established trees in the fall, but on\r\nwell-drained land the practice is usually not necessary. In hilling\r\ntrees, pains should be taken not to leave deep holes, from which the\r\nearth was dug, close to the tree, for water collects in them. Roses and\r\nmany other bushes may be mounded in the fall with profit.\r\n\r\nIt is always advisable to mulch plants that are set in the fall. Any\r\nloose and dry material—as straw, manure, leaves, leafmold, litter from\r\nyards and stables, pine boughs—may be used for this purpose. Very\r\nstrong or compact manures, as those in which there is little straw or\r\nlitter, should be avoided. The ground may be covered to a depth of five\r\nor six inches, or even a foot or more if the material is loose. Avoid\r\nthrowing strong manure directly on the crown of the plants, especially\r\nof herbs, for the materials that leach from the manure sometimes injure\r\nthe crown buds and the roots.\r\n\r\nThis protection may also be given to established plants, particularly\r\nto those which, like roses and herbaceous plants, are expected to give\r\na profusion of bloom the following year. This mulch affords not only\r\nwinter protection, but is an efficient means of fertilizing the land. A\r\nlarge part of the plant-food materials have leached out of the mulch by\r\nspring, and have become incorporated in the soil, where the plant makes\r\nready use of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153: Covering plants in a box.]\r\n\r\nMulches also serve a most useful purpose in preventing the ground from\r\npacking and baking by the weight of snows and rains, and the cementing\r\naction of too much water in the surface soil. In the spring, the\r\ncoarser parts of the mulch may be removed, and the finer parts spaded\r\nor hoed into the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154: Covering plants in a barrel.]\r\n\r\nTender bushes and small trees may be wrapped with straw, hay, burlaps,\r\nor pieces of matting or carpet. Even rather large trees, as bearing\r\npeach trees, are often baled up in this way, or sometimes with corn\r\nfodder, although the results in the protection of fruit-buds are not\r\noften very satisfactory. It is important that no grain is left in the\r\nbaling material, else mice may be attracted to it. (The danger of\r\ngnawing by mice that nest in winter coverings is always to be\r\nanticipated.) It should be known, too, that the object in tying up or\r\nbaling plants is not so much to protect from direct cold as to mitigate\r\nthe effects of alternate freezing and thawing, and to protect from\r\ndrying winds. Plants may be wrapped so thick and tight as to injure\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe labor of protecting large plants is often great and the results\r\nuncertain, and in most cases it is a question whether more satisfaction\r\ncould not be attained by growing only hardy trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\nThe objection to covering tender woody plants cannot be urged with\r\nequal force against tender herbs or very low bushes, for these are\r\nprotected with ease. Even the ordinary mulch may afford sufficient\r\nprotection; and if the tops kill back, the plant quickly renews itself\r\nfrom near the base, and in many plants—as in most hybrid perpetual\r\nroses—the best bloom is on these new growths of the season. Old boxes\r\nor barrels may be used to protect tender low plants (Figs. 153, 154).\r\nThe box is filled with leaves or dry straw and either left open on top\r\nor covered with boards, boughs, or even with burlaps (Fig. 154).\r\n\r\nConnoisseurs of tender roses and other plants sometimes go to the pains\r\nof erecting a collapsible shed over the bush, and filling with leaves\r\nor straw. Whether this is worth while depends wholly on the degree of\r\nsatisfaction that one derives from the growing of choice plants (see\r\n_Roses_, in Chap. VIII).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155. Laying down of trellis-grown blackberries.]\r\n\r\nThe tops of plants may be laid down for the winter. Figure 155 shows a\r\nmethod of laying down blackberries, as practiced in the Hudson River\r\nvalley. The plants were tied to a trellis, as the method is in that\r\ncountry, two wires (_a, b_) having been run on either side of the row.\r\nThe posts are hinged on a pivot to a short post (_c_), and are held in\r\nposition by a brace (_d_). The entire trellis is then laid down on the\r\napproach of winter, as shown in the illustration. The blackberry tops\r\nare so strong that they hold the wires up from the ground, even when\r\nthe trellis is laid down. To hold the wires close to the earth, stakes\r\nare thrust over them in a slanting position, as shown at _n n_. The\r\nsnow that drifts through the plants ordinarily affords sufficient\r\nprotection for plants which are as hardy as grapes and berries. In\r\nfact, the species may be uninjured even without cover, since, in their\r\nprostrate position, they escape the cold and drying winds.\r\n\r\nIn severe climates, or in the case of tender plants, the tops should be\r\ncovered with straw, boughs, or litter, as recommended for regular\r\nmulch-covers. Sometimes a V-shaped trough made from two boards is\r\nplaced over the stems of long or vine-like plants that have been laid\r\ndown. All plants with slender or more or less pliant stems can be laid\r\ndown with ease. With such protection, figs can be grown in the northern\r\nstates. Peach and other fruit trees may be so trained as to be tipped\r\nover and covered.\r\n\r\nLaid-down plants are often injured if the covering remains too late in\r\nthe spring. The ground warms up early, and may start the buds on parts\r\nof the buried plants, and these tender buds may be broken when the\r\nplants are raised, or injured by sun, wind, or frost. The plants should\r\nbe raised while the wood and buds are still hard and dormant.\r\n\r\n_Pruning_.\r\n\r\nPruning is necessary to keep plants in shape, to make them more\r\nfloriferous and fruitful, and to hold them within bounds.\r\n\r\nEven annual plants often may be pruned to advantage. This is true of\r\ntomatoes, from which the superfluous or crowding shoots may be removed,\r\nespecially if the land is so rich that they grow very luxuriantly;\r\nsometimes they are trained to a single stem and most of the side shoots\r\nare taken away as they appear. If plants of marigold, gaillardia, or\r\nother strong and spreading growers are held by stakes or wire-holders\r\n(a good practice), it may be advisable to remove the weak and sprawling\r\nshoots. Balsams give better results when side shoots are taken off. The\r\nremoving of the old flowers, which is to be advised with flower-garden\r\nplants (page 116), is also a species of pruning.\r\n\r\nDistinction should be made between pruning and shearing. Plants are\r\nsheared into given shapes. This may be necessary in bedding-plants, and\r\noccasionally when a formal effect is desired in shrubs and trees; but\r\nthe best taste is displayed, in the vast majority of cases, in allowing\r\nthe plants to assume their natural habits, merely keeping them shapely,\r\ncutting out old or dead wood, and, in some cases, preventing such\r\ncrowding of shoots as will reduce the size of the bloom. The common\r\npractice of shearing shrubbery is very much to be reprehended; this\r\nsubject is discussed from another point of view on page 24.\r\n\r\nThe pruner should know the flower-bearing habit of the plant that he\r\nprunes,—whether the bloom is on the shoots of last season or on the new\r\nwood of the present season, and whether the flower-buds of\r\nspring-blooming plants are separate from the leaf-buds. A very little\r\ncareful observation will determine these points for any plant. (1) The\r\nspring-blooming woody plants usually produce their flowers from buds\r\nperfected the fall before and remaining dormant over winter. This is\r\ntrue of most fruit-trees, and such shrubs as lilac, forsythia, tree\r\npeony, wistaria, some spireas and viburnums, weigela, deutzia. Cutting\r\nback the shoots of these plants early in spring or late in fall,\r\ntherefore, removes the bloom. The proper time to prune such plants\r\n(unless one intends to reduce or thin the bloom) is just after the\r\nflowering season. (2) The summer-blooming woody plants usually produce\r\ntheir flowers on shoots that grow early in the same season. This is\r\ntrue of grapes, quince, hybrid perpetual roses, shrubby hibiscus, crape\r\nmyrtle, mock orange, hydrangea (paniculata), and others. Pruning in\r\nwinter or early spring to secure strong new shoots is, therefore, the\r\nproper procedure in these cases.\r\n\r\nRemarks on pruning may be found under the discussion of roses and other\r\nplants in subsequent chapters, when the plants need any special or\r\npeculiar attention.\r\n\r\nFruit-trees and shade-trees are usually pruned in winter, preferably\r\nlate in winter, or in very early spring. However, there is usually no\r\nobjection to moderate pruning at any time of the year; and moderate\r\npruning every year, rather than violent pruning in occasional years, is\r\nto be advised. It is an old idea that summer pruning tends to favor the\r\nproduction of fruit-buds and therefore to make for fruitfulness; there\r\nis undoubtedly truth in this, but it must be remembered that\r\nfruitfulness is not the result of one treatment or condition, but of\r\nall the conditions under which the plant lives.\r\n\r\nAll limbs should be removed close to the branch or trunk from which\r\nthey arise, and the surface of the wound should be practically parallel\r\nwith such branch or trunk, rather than to be cut back to stubs. The\r\nstubs do not heal readily.\r\n\r\nAll wounds much above an inch across may be protected by a coat of good\r\nlinseed-oil paint; but smaller wounds, if the tree is vigorous, usually\r\nrequire no protection. The object of the paint is to protect the wound\r\nfrom cracking and decay until the healing tissue covers it.\r\n\r\nSuperfluous and interfering branches should be removed from\r\nfruit-trees, so that the top will be fairly open to sun and to the\r\npickers. Well-pruned trees allow of an even distribution and uniform\r\ndevelopment of the fruit. Watersprouts and suckers should be removed as\r\nsoon as they are discovered. How open the top may be, will depend on\r\nthe climate. In the West, open trees suffer from sun-scald.\r\n\r\nThe fruit-bearing habit of the fruit-tree must be considered in the\r\npruning. The pruner should be able to distinguish fruit-buds from\r\nleaf-buds in such species as cherries, plums, apricot, peach, pear,\r\napple, and so prune as to spare these buds or to thin them\r\nunderstandingly. The fruit-buds are distinguished by their position on\r\nthe tree and by their size and shape. They may be on distinct “spurs”\r\nor short branches, in all the above fruits; or, as in the peach, they\r\nmay be chiefly lateral on the new shoots (in the peach, the fruit-buds\r\nare usually two at a node and with a leaf-bud between them), or, as\r\nsometimes in apples and pears, they may be at the ends of last year’s\r\ngrowths. Fruit-buds are usually thicker, or “fatter,” than leaf-buds,\r\nand often fuzzy. Heading-back the tree of course tends to concentrate\r\nthe fruit-buds and to keep them nearer the center of the tree-top; but\r\nheading-back must be combined with intelligent saving and thinning of\r\nthe interior shoots. Heading-back of pears and peaches and plums is\r\nusually a very desirable practice.\r\n\r\n_Tree surgery and protection_.\r\n\r\nAside from the regular pruning to develop the tree into its best form\r\nto enable it to do its best work, there are wounds and malformations to\r\nbe treated. Recently, the treating of injured and decayed trees has\r\nreceived much attention, and “tree doctors” and “tree surgeons” have\r\nengaged in the business. If there are quacks among these people, there\r\nare also competent and reliable men who are doing useful service in\r\nsaving and prolonging the life of trees; one should choose a tree\r\ndoctor with the same care that he would choose any other doctor. The\r\nliability of injury to street trees in the modern city and the\r\nincreasing regard for trees, render the services of good experts\r\nincreasingly necessary.\r\n\r\nStreet trees are injured by many causes: as, starving because of poor\r\nsoil and lack of water under pavements; smoke and dust; leakage from\r\ngas mains and from electric installation; gnawing by horses; butchering\r\nby persons stringing wires; carelessness of contractors and builders;\r\nwind and ice storms; overcrowding; and the blundering work of persons\r\nwho think that they know how to prune. Well-enforced municipal\r\nregulations should be able to control most of these troubles.\r\n\r\nTree guards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156. Lath tree guard.] [Illustration: Fig. 157.\r\nWire-and-post tree guard]\r\n\r\nAlong roadsides and other exposed places it is often necessary to\r\nprotect newly set trees from horses, boys, and vehicles. There are\r\nvarious kinds of tree guards for this purpose. The best types are those\r\nthat are more or less open, so as to allow the free passage of air and\r\nwhich are so far removed from the body of the tree that its trunk may\r\nexpand without difficulty. If the guards are very tight, they may shade\r\nthe trunk so much that the tree may suffer when the guard is removed,\r\nand they prevent the discovery of insects and injuries. It is important\r\nthat the guard does not fill with litter in which insects may harbor.\r\nAs soon as the tree is old enough to escape injury, the guards should\r\nbe removed. A very good guard, made of laths held together with three\r\nstrips of band-iron, and secured to iron posts, is shown in Fig. 156.\r\nFigure 157. shows a guard made by winding fencing wire upon three posts\r\nor stakes. When there is likely to be danger from too great shading of\r\nthe trunk, this latter form of guard is one of the best. There are good\r\nforms of tree guards on the market. Of course hitching-posts should be\r\nprovided, wherever horses are to stand, to remove the temptation of\r\nhitching to trees. Figure 158, however, shows a very good device when a\r\nhitching post is not wanted. A strong stick, four or five feet long, is\r\nsecured to the tree by a staple and at the lower end of the stick is a\r\nshort chain with a snap in the end. The snap is secured to the bridle,\r\nand the horse is not able to reach the tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 158. How a horse may be hitched to a tree.]\r\n\r\nMice and rabbits.\r\n\r\nTrees and bushes are often seriously injured by the gnawing of mice and\r\nrabbits. The best preventive is not to have the vermin. If there are no\r\nplaces in which rabbits and mice can burrow and breed, there will be\r\nlittle difficulty. At the approach of winter, if mice are feared, the\r\ndry litter should be removed from about the trees, or it should be\r\npacked down very firm, so that the mice cannot nest in it. If the\r\nrodents are very abundant, it may be advisable to wrap fine wire\r\nnetting about the base of the tree. A boy who is fond of trapping or\r\nhunting will ordinarily solve the rabbit difficulty. Rags tied on\r\nsticks which are placed at intervals about the plantation will often\r\nfrighten rabbits away.\r\n\r\nGirdled trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 159. Bridge-grafting a girdle.]\r\n\r\nTrees that are girdled by mice should be wrapped up as soon as\r\ndiscovered, so that the wood shall not become too dry. When warm\r\nweather approaches, shave off the edges of the girdle so that the\r\nhealing tissue may grow freely, smear the whole surface with\r\ngrafting-wax, or with clay, and bind the whole wound with strong\r\ncloths. Even though the tree is completely girdled for a distance of\r\nthree or four inches, it usually may be saved by this treatment, unless\r\nthe injury extends into the wood. The water from the roots rises\r\nthrough the soft wood and not between the bark and the wood, as\r\ncommonly supposed. When this sap water has reached the foliage, it\r\ntakes part in the elaboration of plant-food, and this food is\r\ndistributed throughout the plant, the path of transfer being in the\r\ninner layers of bark. This food material, being distributed back to the\r\ngirdle, will generally heal over the wound if the wood is not allowed\r\nto become dry.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, it is necessary to join the bark above and\r\nbelow the girdle by means of cions, which are whittled to a wedge-shape\r\non either end, and inserted underneath the two edges of the bark (Fig.\r\n159). The ends of the cions and the edges of the wound are held by a\r\nbandage of cloth, and the whole work is protected by melted\r\ngrafting-wax poured upon it. [Footnote: A good grafting-wax is made as\r\nfollows: Into a kettle place one part by weight of tallow, two parts of\r\nbeeswax, four parts of rosin. When completely melted, pour into a tub\r\nor pail of cold water, then work it with the hands (which should be\r\ngreased) until it develops a grain and becomes the color of taffy\r\ncandy. The whole question of the propagation of plants is discussed in\r\n“The Nursery-Book.”]\r\n\r\nRepairing street trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 161. A wound, made by freezing, trimmed out and\r\nfilled with cement.]\r\n\r\nThe following advice on “tree surgery” is by A.D. Taylor (Bulletin 256,\r\nCornell University, from which the accompanying illustrations are\r\nadapted):—\r\n\r\n“Tree surgery includes the intelligent protection of all mechanical\r\ninjuries and cavities. Pruning requires a previous intimate knowledge\r\nof the habits of growth of trees; surgery, on the other hand, requires\r\nin addition a knowledge of the best methods for making cavities\r\nair-tight and preventing decay. The filling of cavities in trees has\r\nnot been practiced sufficiently long to warrant making a definite\r\nstatement as to the permanent success or failure of the operation; the\r\nwork is still in an experimental stage. The caring for cavities in\r\ntrees must be urged as the only means of preserving affected specimens,\r\nand the preservation of many noble specimens has been at least\r\ntemporarily assured through the efforts of those practicing this kind\r\nof work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 160. A cement-filled cavity at the base of a tree.]\r\n\r\n“Successful operation depends on two important factors: first, that all\r\ndecayed parts of the cavity be wholly removed and the exposed surface\r\nthoroughly washed with an antiseptic; second, that the cavity, when\r\nfilled, must be air tight and hermetically sealed if possible. Trees\r\nare treated as follows: The cavity is thoroughly cleaned by removing\r\nall decayed wood and washing the interior surface with a solution of\r\ncopper sulfate and lime, in order to destroy any fungi that may remain.\r\nThe edges of the cavity are cut smooth in order to allow free growth of\r\nthe cambium after the cavity is filled. Any antiseptic, such as\r\ncorrosive sublimate, creosote, or even paint, may answer the purpose;\r\ncreosote, however, possesses the most penetrating powers of any. The\r\nmethod of filling the cavities depends to a great extent on their size\r\nand form. Very large cavities with great openings are generally bricked\r\non the outside, over the opening, and filled on the inside with\r\nconcrete, the brick serving the purpose of a retaining wall to hold the\r\nconcrete in place. Concrete used for the main filling is usually made\r\nin the proportion of one part good Portland cement, two parts sand, and\r\nfour parts crushed stone, the consistency of the mixture being such\r\nthat it may be poured into the cavity and require little or no tamping\r\nto make the mass solid. (Fig. 160.)\r\n\r\n“Fillings thus made are considered by expert tree surgeons to be a\r\npermanent preventive of decay. The outside of the filling is always\r\ncoated with a thin covering of concrete, consisting of one part cement\r\nto two parts fine sand. Cavities resulting from freezing, and which,\r\nthough large on the inside, show only a long narrow crack on the\r\noutside, are most easily filled by placing a form against the entire\r\nlength of the opening, having a space at the top through which the\r\ncement may be poured (Fig. 161). Another method of retaining the\r\nconcrete is to reinforce it from the outside by driving rows of spikes\r\nalong the inner surface of either side of the cavity and lacing a stout\r\nwire across the face of the cavity. For best results, all fillings must\r\ncome flush with the inner bark when finished. During the first year,\r\nthis growing tissue will spread over the outer edge of the filling,\r\nthus forming an hermetically sealed cavity. In the course of time, the\r\noutside of small or narrow openings should be completely covered with\r\ntissue, which buries the filling from view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 162. Bridge-grafting or in-arching from saplings\r\nplanted about the tree.]\r\n\r\n“It has been found that there is a tendency for portland cement to\r\ncontract from the wood after it dries, leaving a space between the wood\r\nand the cement through which water and germs of decay may enter. A\r\nremedy for this defect has been suggested in the use of a thick coat of\r\ntar, or an elastic cement which might be spread over the surface of the\r\ncavity before filling. The cracking of portland cement on the surface\r\nof long cavities is caused by the swaying of trees during heavy storms,\r\nand should not occur if the filling is correctly done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 163. Faulty methods of bracing a crotched tree. The\r\nlower method is wholly wrong. The upper method is good if the\r\nbolt-heads are properly counter-sunk and the bolts tightly fitted; but\r\nif the distance between the branches is great, it is better to have two\r\nbolts and join them by hooks, to allow of wind movements.]\r\n\r\n“In addition to the preservation of decayed specimens by filling the\r\ncavities, as above outlined, it has been proposed to strengthen the\r\ntree by treating it as shown in Fig. 162. Young saplings of the same\r\nspecies, after having become established as shown, are grafted by\r\napproach to the mature specimen.\r\n\r\n“Injury frequently results from error in the method of attempting to\r\nsave broken, or to strengthen and support weak branches that are\r\notherwise healthy. The means used for supporting cracked, wind-racked,\r\nand overladen branches which show a tendency to split at the forks are\r\nbolting and chaining. The practice of placing iron bands around large\r\nbranches in order to protect them has resulted in much harm; as the\r\ntree grows and expands, such bands tighten, causing the bark to be\r\nbroken and resulting after a few years in a partial girdling (Fig.\r\n163).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 164. Trees ruined to allow of the passage of\r\nwires.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 165. Accommodating a wall to a valuable tree.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 166. The death of a long stub.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 167. Bungling pruning.] [Illustration: Fig. 168.\r\nThe proper way to saw off a large limb. A cut is first made on the\r\nunder side to prevent splitting down; then it is cut on the upper side.\r\nThen the entire “stub” is removed close to the trunk.]\r\n\r\n“To bolt a tree correctly is comparatively inexpensive. The safest\r\nmethod consists in passing a strong bolt through a hole bored in the\r\nbranch for this purpose, and fastening it on the outside by means of a\r\nwasher and a nut. Generally the washer has been placed against the bark\r\nand the nut then holds it in place. A better method of bolting, and one\r\nwhich insures a neat appearance of the branch in addition to serving as\r\nthe most certain safeguard against the entrance of disease, is to\r\ncounter-sink the nut in the bark and imbed it in portland cement. The\r\nhole for the sinking of the nut and washer is thickly coated with lead\r\npaint and then with a layer of cement, on which are placed the nut and\r\nwasher, both of which are then imbedded in cement. If the outer surface\r\nof the nut be flush with the plane of the bark, within a few years it\r\nwill be covered by the growing tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 169. A weak-bodied young tree well supported;\r\npadding is placed under the bandages.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 170. The wrong way of attaching a guy rope.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 171. An allowable way of attaching a guy rope.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 172. The best way of attaching a guy rope, if a\r\ntree must be used as support.]\r\n\r\n“The inner ends of the rods in the two branches may be connected by a\r\nrod or chain. The preference for the chain over the rod attachment is\r\nbased on the compressive and tensile stresses which come on the\r\nconnection during wind storms. Rod connections are preferred, however,\r\nwhen rigidity is required, as in unions made close to the crotch; but\r\nfor tying two branches together before they have shown signs of\r\nweakening at the fork, the chain may best be used, as the point of\r\nattachment may be placed some distance from the crotch, where the\r\nflexibility factor will be important and the strain comparatively\r\nsmall. Elms in an advanced stage of maturity, if subjected to severe\r\nclimatic conditions, often show this tendency to split. These trees,\r\nespecially, should be carefully inspected and means taken to preserve\r\nthem, by bolting if necessary.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 173. A method of saving valuable trees along\r\nstreets on which heavy lowering of grade has been made.]\r\n\r\nThe illustrations, Figs. 164-173, are self-explanatory, and show poor\r\npractice and good practice in the care of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. A rocky bank covered with permanent informal planting. IX. A rocky\r\nbank covered with permanent informal planting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The grafting of plants_.\r\n\r\nGrafting is the operation of inserting a piece of a plant into another\r\nplant with the intention that it shall grow. It differs from the making\r\nof cuttings in the fact that the severed part grows in another plant\r\nrather than in the soil.\r\n\r\nThere are two general kinds of grafting—one of which inserts a piece of\r\nbranch in the stock (grafting proper), and one which inserts only a bud\r\nwith little or no wood attached (budding). In both cases the success of\r\nthe operation depends on the growing together of the cambium of the\r\ncion (or cutting) and that of the stock. The cambium is the new and\r\ngrowing tissue lying underneath the bark and on the outside of the\r\ngrowing wood. Therefore, the line of demarcation between the bark and\r\nthe wood should coincide when the cion and stock are joined.\r\n\r\nThe plant on which the severed piece is set is called the stock. The\r\npart which is removed and set into the stock is called a cion if it is\r\na piece of a branch, or a “bud” if it is only a single bud with a bit\r\nof tissue attached.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of grafting and budding is performed when the cion or\r\nbud is nearly or quite dormant. That is, grafting is usually done late\r\nin winter and early in spring, and budding may be performed then, or\r\nlate in summer, when the buds have nearly or quite matured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 174. Budding. The “bud”; the opening to receive it;\r\nthe bud tied.]\r\n\r\nThe chief object of grafting is to perpetuate a kind of plant which\r\nwill not reproduce itself from seed, or of which seed is very difficult\r\nto obtain. Cions or buds are therefore taken from this plant and set\r\ninto whatever kind of plant is obtainable on which they will grow.\r\nThus, if one wants to propagate the Baldwin apple, he does not for that\r\npurpose sow seeds thereof, but takes cions or buds from a Baldwin tree\r\nand grafts them into some other apple tree. The stocks are usually\r\nobtained from seeds. In the case of the apple, young plants are raised\r\nfrom seeds which are secured mostly from cider factories, without\r\nreference to the variety from which they came. When the seedlings have\r\ngrown to a certain age, they are budded or grafted, the grafted part\r\nmaking the entire top of the tree; and the top bears fruit like that of\r\nthe tree from which the cions were taken.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which the union between cion and stock is made.\r\nBudding may be first discussed. It consists in inserting a bud\r\nunderneath the bark of the stock, and the commonest practice is that\r\nwhich is shown in the illustrations. Budding is mostly performed in\r\nJuly, August, and early September, when the bark is still loose or in\r\ncondition to peel. Twigs are cut from the tree which it is desired to\r\npropagate, and the buds are cut off with a sharp knife, a shield-shaped\r\nbit of bark (with possibly a little wood) being left with them (Fig.\r\n174). The bud is then shoved into a slit made in the stock, and it is\r\nheld in place by tying with a soft strand. In two or three weeks the\r\nbud will have “stuck” (that is, it will have grown fast to the stock),\r\nand the strand is cut to prevent its strangling the stock. Ordinarily\r\nthe bud does not grow until the following spring, at which time the\r\nentire stock or branch in which the bud is inserted is cut off an inch\r\nabove the bud; and the bud thereby receives all the energy of the\r\nstock. Budding is the commonest grafting operation in nurseries. Seeds\r\nof peaches may be sown in spring, and the plants which result will be\r\nready for budding that same August. The following spring, or a year\r\nfrom the planting of the seed, the stock is cut off just above the bud\r\n(which is inserted near the ground), and in the fall of that year the\r\ntree is ready for sale; that is, the top is one season old and the root\r\nis two seasons old, but in the trade it is known as a one-year-old\r\ntree. In the South, the peach stock may be budded in June or early July\r\nof the year in which the seed is planted, and the bud grows into a\r\nsaleable tree the same year: this is known as June budding. In apples\r\nand pears the stock is usually two years old before it is budded, and\r\nthe tree is not sold until the top has grown two or three years.\r\nBudding may be performed also in the spring, in which case the bud will\r\ngrow the same season. Budding is always done on young growths,\r\npreferably on those not more than one year old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 175. Whip-graft.]\r\n\r\nGrafting is the insertion of a small branch (or cion), usually bearing\r\nmore than one bud. If grafting is employed on small stocks, it is\r\ncustomary to employ the whip-graft (Fig. 175). Both stock and cion are\r\ncut across diagonally, and a split made in each, so that one fits into\r\nthe other. The graft is tied securely with a string, and then, if it is\r\nabove ground, it is also waxed carefully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 176. Cleft-graft before waxing.]\r\n\r\nIn larger limbs or stocks, the common method is to employ the\r\ncleft-graft (Fig. 176). This consists in cutting off the stock,\r\nsplitting it, and inserting a wedge-shaped cion in one or both sides of\r\nthe split, taking care that the cambium layer of the cion matches that\r\nof the stock. The exposed surfaces are then securely covered with wax.\r\n\r\nGrafting is usually performed early in the spring, just before the buds\r\nswell. The cions should have been cut before this time, when they were\r\nperfectly dormant. Cions may be stored in sand in the cellar or in the\r\nice-house, or they may be buried in the field. The object is to keep\r\nthem fresh and dormant until they are wanted.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to change the top of an old plum, apple, or pear tree\r\nto some other variety, it is usually accomplished by means of the\r\ncleft-graft. If the tree is very young, budding or whip-grafting may be\r\nemployed. On an old top the cions should begin to bear when three to\r\nfour years old. All the main limbs should be grafted. It is important\r\nto keep down the suckers or watersprouts from around the grafts, and\r\npart of the remaining top should be cut away each year until the top is\r\nentirely changed over (which will result in two to four years).\r\n\r\nA good wax for covering the exposed parts is described in the footnote\r\non page 145.\r\n\r\n_Keeping records of the plantation_.\r\n\r\nIf one has a large and valuable collection of fruit or ornamental\r\nplants, it is desirable that he have some permanent record of them. The\r\nmost satisfactory method is to label the plants, and then to make a\r\nchart or map on which the various plants are indicated in their proper\r\npositions. The labels are always liable to be lost and to become\r\nillegible, and they are often misplaced by careless workmen or\r\nmischievous boys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 177. The common stake label.]\r\n\r\nFor vegetables, annuals, and other temporary plants, the best labels\r\nare simple stakes, like that shown in Fig. 177. Garden stakes a foot\r\nlong, an inch wide, and three-eighths inch thick may be bought of label\r\nmanufacturers for three to five dollars a thousand. These take a soft\r\npencil very readily, and if the labels are taken up in the fall and\r\nstored in a dry place, they will last two or three years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 178. A good stake label, with the legend covered.]\r\n\r\nFor more permanent herbaceous plants, as rhubarb and asparagus, or even\r\nfor bushes, a stake that is sawed from clear pine or cypress, eighteen\r\ninches long, three inches wide, and an inch or more thick, affords a\r\nmost excellent label. The lower end of the stake is sawed to a point,\r\nand is dipped in coal tar or creosote, or other preservative. The top\r\nof the stake is painted white, and the legend is written with a large\r\nand soft pencil. When the writing becomes illegible or the stake is\r\nneeded for other plants, a shaving is taken off the face of the label\r\nwith a plane, a fresh coat of paint added, and the label is as good as\r\never. These labels are strong enough to withstand shocks from\r\nwhiffletrees and tools, and should last ten years.\r\n\r\nWhenever a legend is written with a lead pencil, it is advisable to use\r\nthe pencil when the paint (which should be white lead) is still fresh\r\nor soft. Figure 178 shows a very good device for preserving the writing\r\non the face of the label. A block of wood is secured to the label by\r\nmeans of a screw, covering the legend completely and protecting it from\r\nthe weather.\r\n\r\nIf more ornamental stake labels are desired, various types can be\r\nbought in the market, or one can be made after the fashion of Fig. 179.\r\nThis is a zinc plate that can be painted black, on which the name is\r\nwritten with white paint. Many persons, however, prefer to paint the\r\nzinc white, and write or stamp the label with black ink or black type.\r\nTwo strong wire legs are soldered to the label, and these prevent it\r\nfrom turning around. These labels are, of course, much more expensive\r\nthan the ordinary stake labels, and are usually not so satisfactory,\r\nalthough more attractive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 179. Metal stake label.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 180. Zinc tallies.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 181. Common zinc tally.]\r\n\r\nFor labeling trees, various kinds of zinc tallies are in common use, as\r\nshown in Figs. 180 and 181. Fresh zinc takes a lead pencil readily, and\r\nthe writing often becomes more legible as it becomes older, and it will\r\nusually remain three or four years. These labels are attached either by\r\nwires, as _a, b_, Fig. 180, or they are wound about the limb as shown\r\nin _c, d_, and _e_, in Fig. 180. The type of zinc label most in use is\r\na simple strip of zinc, as shown in Fig. 181, wrapped about the limb.\r\nThe metal is so flexible that it expands readily with the growth of the\r\nbranch. While these zinc labels are durable, they are very\r\ninconspicuous because of their neutral color, and it is often difficult\r\nto find them in dense masses of foliage.\r\n\r\nThe common wooden label of the nurserymen (Fig. 182) is perhaps as\r\nuseful as any for general purposes. If the label has had a light coat\r\nof thin white lead, and the legend has been made with a soft lead\r\npencil, the writing should remain legible four or five years. Fig. 183\r\nshows another type of label that is more durable, since the wire is\r\nstiff and large, and is secured around the limb by means of pincers.\r\nThe large loop allows the limb to expand, and the stiff wire prevents\r\nthe misplacing of the label by winds and workmen. The tally itself is\r\nwhat is known as the “package label” of the nurserymen, being six\r\ninches long, one and one-fourth inches wide, and costing (painted) less\r\nthan one and one-half dollars a thousand. The legend is made with a\r\nlead pencil when the paint is fresh, and sometimes the label is dipped\r\nin thin white lead after the writing is made, so that the paint covers\r\nthe writing with a very thin protecting coat. A similar label is shown\r\nin Fig. 184., which has a large wire loop, with a coil, to allow the\r\nexpansion of the limb. The tallies of this type are often made of\r\nglass, or porcelain with the name indelibly printed in them. Figure\r\n185. shows a zinc tally, which is secured to the tree by means of a\r\nsharp and pointed wire driven into the wood. Some prefer to have two\r\narms to this wire, driving one point on either side of the tree. If\r\ngalvanized wire is used, these labels will last for many years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 182. A common nursery label.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 183. Cornell tree label.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 184. Serviceable large-loop tree label.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 185. Zinc tree label.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 186. Injury by a tight label wire.]\r\n\r\nIt is very important, when adjusting labels to trees, to be sure that\r\nthe wire is not twisted tight against the wood. Figure 186 shows the\r\ninjury that is likely to result from label wires. When a tree is\r\nconstricted or girdled, it is very liable to be broken off by winds. It\r\nshould be a rule to attach the label to a limb of minor importance, so\r\nthat if the wire should injure the part, the loss will not be serious.\r\nWhen the label, Fig. 182, is applied, only the tips of the wire should\r\nbe twisted together, leaving a large loop for the expansion of the\r\nlimb.\r\n\r\n_The storing of fruits and vegetables_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 187. The old-fashioned “outdoor cellar,” still a\r\nvery useful and convenient storage place.]\r\n\r\nThe principles involved in the storing of perishable products, as\r\nfruits and vegetables, differ with the different commodities. All the\r\nroot-crops, and most fruits, need to be kept in a cool, moist, and\r\nuniform temperature if they are to be preserved a great length of time.\r\nSquashes, sweet-potatoes, and some other things need to be kept in an\r\nintermediate and what might be called a high temperature; and the\r\natmosphere should be drier than for most other products. The low\r\ntemperature has the effect of arresting decomposition and the work of\r\nfungi and bacteria. The moist atmosphere has the effect of preventing\r\ntoo great evaporation and the consequent shriveling.\r\n\r\nIn the storing of any commodity, it is very important that the product\r\nis in proper condition for keeping. Discard all specimens that are\r\nbruised or are likely to decay. Much of the decay of fruits and\r\nvegetables in storage is not the fault of the storage process, but is\r\nreally the work of diseases with which the materials are infected\r\nbefore they are put into storage. For example, if potatoes and cabbages\r\nare affected with the rot, it is practically impossible to keep them\r\nany length of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 188. Lean-to fruit cellar, covered with earth. The\r\nroof should be of cement or stone slabs. Provide a ventilator.]\r\n\r\nApples, winter pears, and all roots, should be kept at a temperature\r\nsomewhat near the freezing point. It should not rise above 40° F. for\r\nbest results. Apples can be kept even at one or two degrees below the\r\nfreezing point if the temperature is uniform. Cellars in which there\r\nare heaters are likely to be too dry and the temperature too high. In\r\nsuch places it is well to keep fresh vegetables and fruits in tight\r\nreceptacles, and pack the roots in sand or moss in order to prevent\r\nshriveling. In these places, apples usually keep better if headed up in\r\nbarrels than if kept on racks or shelves. In moist and cool cellars,\r\nhowever, it is preferable for the home supply to place them on shelves,\r\nnot piling them more than five or six inches deep, for then they can be\r\nsorted over as occasion requires. In case of fruits, be sure that the\r\nspecimens are not over-ripe when placed in storage. If apples are\r\nallowed to lie in the sun for a few days before being packed, they will\r\nripen so much that it is very difficult to keep them.\r\n\r\nCabbages should be kept at a low and uniform temperature, and water\r\nshould be drained away from them. They are stored in many ways in the\r\nfield, but success depends so much on the season, particular variety,\r\nripeness, and the freedom from injuries by fungi and insects, that\r\nuniform results are rarely secured by any one method. The best results\r\nare to be expected when they can be kept in a house built for the\r\npurpose, in which the temperature is uniform and the air fairly moist.\r\nWhen stored out of doors, they are likely to freeze and thaw\r\nalternately; and if the water runs into the heads, mischief results.\r\nSometimes they are easily stored by being piled into a conical heap on\r\nwell-drained soil and covered with dry straw, and the straw covered\r\nwith boards. It does not matter if they are frosted, provided they do\r\nnot thaw out frequently. Sometimes cabbages are laid head down in a\r\nshallow furrow plowed in well-drained land, and over them is thrown\r\nstraw, the stumps being allowed to project through the cover. It is\r\nonly in winters of rather uniform temperature that good results are to\r\nbe expected from such methods. These are some of the main\r\nconsiderations involved in the storing of such things as cabbage; the\r\nsubject is mentioned again in the discussion of cabbage in Chapter X.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 189. A fruit storage house cooled by ice.]\r\n\r\nIn the storing of all products, especially those which have soft and\r\ngreen matter, as cabbages, it is well to provide against the heating of\r\nthe produce. If the things are buried out of doors, it is important to\r\nput on a very light cover at first so that the heat may escape. Cover\r\nthem gradually as the cold weather comes on. This is important with all\r\nvegetables that are placed in pits, as potatoes, beets, and the like.\r\nIf covered deeply at once, they are likely to heat and rot. All pits\r\nmade out of doors should be on well-drained and preferably sandy land.\r\n\r\nWhen vegetables are wanted at intervals during the winter from pits, it\r\nis well to make compartment pits, each compartment holding a wagon load\r\nor whatever quantity will be likely to be wanted at each time. These\r\npits are sunk in well-drained land, and between each of the two pits is\r\nleft a wall of earth about a foot thick. One pit can then be emptied in\r\ncold weather without interfering with the others.\r\n\r\nAn outside cellar is better than a house cellar in which there is a\r\nheater, but it is not so handy. If it is near the house, it need not be\r\ninconvenient, however. A house is usually healthier if the cellar is\r\nnot used for storage. House cellars used for storage should have a\r\nventilating shaft.\r\n\r\nSome of the principles involved in an ice-cooled storage house are\r\nexplained in the diagram, Fig. 189. If the reader desires to make a\r\ncareful study of storage and storage structures, he should consult\r\ncyclopedias and special articles.\r\n\r\n_The forcing of plants_.\r\n\r\nThere are three general means (aside from greenhouses) of forcing\r\nplants ahead of their season in the early spring—by means of\r\nforcing-hills and hand-boxes, by coldframes, and by hotbeds.\r\n\r\nThe forcing-hill is an arrangement by means of which a single plant or\r\na single “hill” of plants may be forced where it permanently stands.\r\nThis type of forcing may be applied to perennial plants, as rhubarb and\r\nasparagus, or to annuals, as melons and cucumbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 190. Forcing-hill for rhubarb.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 190 is illustrated a common method of hastening the growth of\r\nrhubarb in the spring. A box with four removable sides, two of which\r\nare shown in end section in the figure, is placed around the plant in\r\nthe fall. The inside of the box is filled with straw or litter, and the\r\noutside is banked thoroughly with any refuse, to prevent the ground\r\nfrom freezing. When it is desired to start the plants, the covering is\r\nremoved from both the inside and outside of the box and hot manure is\r\npiled around the box to its top.\r\n\r\nIf the weather is yet cold, dry light leaves or straw may be placed\r\ninside the box; or a pane or sash of glass may be placed on top of the\r\nbox, when it will become a coldframe. Rhubarb, asparagus, sea-kale, and\r\nsimilar plants may be advanced two or four weeks by means of this\r\nmethod of forcing. Some gardeners use old barrels or half-barrels in\r\nplace of the box. The box, however, is better and handier, and the\r\nsides can be stored for future use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 191. Forcing-hill, and the mold or frame for making\r\nit.]\r\n\r\nPlants that require a long season in which to mature, and which do not\r\ntransplant readily, as melons and cucumbers, may be planted in\r\nforcing-hills in the field. One of these hills is shown in Fig. 191.\r\nThe frame or mold is shown at the left. This mold is a box with flaring\r\nsides and no top or bottom, and provided with a handle. This frame is\r\nplaced with the small end down at the point where the seeds are to be\r\nplanted, and the earth is hilled up about it and firmly packed with the\r\nfeet. The mold is then withdrawn, and a pane of glass is laid upon the\r\ntop of the mound to concentrate the sun’s rays, and to prevent the bank\r\nfrom washing down with the rains. A clod of earth or a stone may be\r\nplaced upon the pane to hold it down. Sometimes a brick is used as a\r\nmold. This type of forcing-hill is not much used, because the bank of\r\nearth is liable to be washed away, and heavy rain coming when the glass\r\nis off will fill the hill with water and drown the plant. However, it\r\ncan be used to very good advantage when the gardener can give it close\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 192. Hand-box.]\r\n\r\nA forcing-hill is sometimes made by digging a hole in the ground and\r\nplanting the seeds in the bottom of it, placing the pane of glass upon\r\na slight ridge or mound which is made on the surface of the ground.\r\nThis method is less desirable than the other, because the seeds are\r\nplaced in the poorest and coldest soil, and the hole is very likely to\r\nfill with water in the early days of spring.\r\n\r\nAn excellent type of forcing-hill is made by the use of the hand-box,\r\nas shown in Fig. 192. This is a rectangular box, without top or bottom,\r\nand a pane of glass is slipped into a groove at the top. It is really a\r\nminiature coldframe. The earth is banked up slightly about the box, in\r\norder to hold it against winds and to prevent the water from running\r\ninto it. If these boxes are made of good lumber and painted, they will\r\nlast for many years. Any size of glass may be used which is desired,\r\nbut a ten-by-twelve pane is as good as any for general purposes.\r\n\r\nAfter the plants are thoroughly established in these forcing-hills, and\r\nthe weather is settled, the protection is wholly removed, and the\r\nplants grow normally in the open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 193. Glass forcing-hill.]\r\n\r\nA very good temporary protection may be given to tender plants by using\r\nfour panes of glass, as explained in Fig. 193, the two inner panes\r\nbeing held together at the top by a block of wood through which four\r\nnails are driven. Plants are more likely to burn in these glass frames\r\nthan in the hand-boxes, and such frames are not so well adapted to the\r\nprotection of plants in very early spring; but they are often useful\r\nfor special purposes.\r\n\r\nIn all forcing-hills, as in coldframes and hotbeds, it is exceedingly\r\nimportant that the plants receive plenty of air on bright days. Plants\r\nthat are kept too close become weak or “drawn”, and lose the ability to\r\nwithstand changes of weather when the protection is removed. Even\r\nthough the wind is cold and raw, the plants inside the frames\r\nordinarily will not suffer if the glass is taken off when the sun is\r\nshining.\r\n\r\nColdframes.\r\n\r\nA coldframe is nothing more than an enlarged hand-box; that is, instead\r\nof protecting but a single plant or a single hill with a single pane of\r\nglass, the frame is covered with sash, and is large enough to\r\naccommodate many plants.\r\n\r\nThere are three general purposes for which a coldframe is used: For the\r\nstarting of plants early in spring; for receiving partially hardened\r\nplants that have been started earlier in hotbeds and forcing-houses;\r\nfor wintering young cabbages, lettuce, and other hardy plants that are\r\nsown in the fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 194. Coldframe against a building. Plants at E;\r\nsill of house at A; basement opening at B.]\r\n\r\nColdframes are ordinarily placed near the buildings, and the plants are\r\ntransplanted into the field when settled weather comes. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, they are made directly in the field where the plants are to\r\nremain, and the frames, and not the plants, are removed. When used for\r\nthis latter purpose, the frames are made very cheap by running two rows\r\nof parallel planks through the field at a distance apart of six feet.\r\nThe plank on the north is ordinarily ten to twelve inches wide, and\r\nthat on the south eight to ten inches. These planks are held in place\r\nby stakes, and the sashes are laid across them. Seeds of radishes,\r\nbeets, lettuce, and the like, are then sown beneath the sash, and when\r\nsettled weather arrives, the sash and planks are removed and the plants\r\nare growing naturally in the field. Half-hardy plants, as those\r\nmentioned, may be started fully two or three weeks in advance of the\r\nnormal season by this means.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 195. Weather screen, or coldframe, against a\r\nbuilding.]\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest types of coldframes is shown in Fig. 194, which is\r\na lean-to against the foundation of a house. A sill is run just above\r\nthe surface of the ground, and the sashes, shown at D, are laid on\r\nrafters which run from this sill to the sill of the house, A. If this\r\nframe is on the south side of the building, plants may be started even\r\nas early as a month before the opening of the season. Such lean-to\r\nframes are sometimes made against greenhouses or warm cellars, and heat\r\nis supplied to them by the opening of a door in the wall, as at B. In\r\nframes that are in such sunny positions as these, it is exceedingly\r\nimportant that care be taken to remove the sash, or at least to give\r\nample ventilation, in all sunny days.\r\n\r\nA different type of lean-to structure is shown in Fig. 195. This may be\r\neither a temporary or permanent building, and it is generally used for\r\nthe protection of half-hardy plants that are grown in pots and tubs. It\r\nmay be used, however, for the purpose of forwarding pot-plants early in\r\nthe spring and for protection of peaches, grapes, oranges, or other\r\nfruits in tubs or boxes. If it is desired merely to protect the plants\r\nthrough the winter, it is best to have the structure on the north side\r\nof the building, in order that the sun may not force the plants into\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 196. A pit or coldframe on permanent walls, and a\r\nuseful adjunct to a garden. The rear cover is open (_a_).]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 197. The usual form of coldframe.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 198. A strong and durable frame.]\r\n\r\nAnother structure that may be used both to carry half-hardy plants over\r\nwinter and for starting plants early in spring is shown in Fig. 196. It\r\nis really a miniature greenhouse without heat. It is well adapted for\r\nmild climates. The picture was made from a structure in the coast\r\nregion of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe common type of coldframe is shown in Fig. 197. It is twelve feet\r\nlong and six feet wide, and is covered with four three-by-six sash. It\r\nis made of ordinary lumber loosely nailed together. If one expects to\r\nuse coldframes or hotbeds every year, however, it is advisable to make\r\nthe frames of two-inch stuff, well painted, and to join the parts by\r\nbolts and tenons, so that they may be taken apart and stored until\r\nneeded for the next year’s crop. Figure 198 suggests a method of making\r\nframes so that they may be taken apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 199. A frame yard.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 200. Portable coldframe.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 201. A larger portable coldframe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 202. A commodious portable frame.]\r\n\r\nIt is always advisable to place coldframes and hotbeds in a protected\r\nplace, and particularly to protect them from cold north winds.\r\nBuildings afford excellent protection, but the sun is sometimes too hot\r\non the south side of large and light-colored buildings. One of the best\r\nmeans of protection is to plant a hedge of evergreens, as shown in Fig.\r\n199. It is always desirable, also to place all the coldframes and\r\nhotbeds close together, for the purpose of economizing time and labor.\r\nA regular area or yard may be set aside for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 203. A low coldframe.]\r\n\r\nVarious small and portable coldframes may be used about the garden for\r\nthe protection of tender plants or to start them early in the spring.\r\nPansies, daisies, and border carnations, for example, may be brought on\r\nvery early by setting such frames over them or by planting them under\r\nthe frames in the fall. These frames may be of any size desired, and\r\nthe sash may be either removable, or, in case of small frames, they may\r\nbe hinged at the top. Figs. 200-203 illustrate various types.\r\n\r\nHotbeds.\r\n\r\nA hotbed differs from a coldframe in being provided with bottom heat.\r\nThis heat is ordinarily supplied by means of fermenting manure, but it\r\nmay be obtained from other fermenting material, as tanbark or leaves,\r\nor from artificial heat, as flues, steam pipes, or water pipes.\r\n\r\nThe hotbed is used for the very early starting of plants; and when the\r\nplants have outgrown the bed, or have become too thick, they are\r\ntransplanted into cooler hotbeds or into coldframes. There are some\r\ncrops, however, that are carried to full maturity in the hotbed itself,\r\nas radishes and lettuce.\r\n\r\nThe date at which the hotbed may be started with safety depends almost\r\nentirely on the means at command of heating it and on the skill of the\r\noperator. In the northern states, where outdoor gardening does not\r\nbegin until the first or the last of May, hotbeds are sometimes started\r\nas early as January; but they are ordinarily delayed until early in\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\nThe heat for hotbeds is commonly supplied by the fermentation of horse\r\nmanure. It is important that the manure be as uniform as possible in\r\ncomposition and texture, that it come from highly fed horses, and is\r\npractically of the same age. The best results are usually secured with\r\nmanure from livery stables, from which it can be obtained in large\r\nquantities in a short space of time. Perhaps as much as one half of the\r\nwhole material should be of litter or straw that has been used in the\r\nbedding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 204. Hotbed with manure on top of the ground.]\r\n\r\nThe manure is placed in a long and shallow square-topped pile, not more\r\nthan four or six feet high, as a rule, and is then allowed to ferment.\r\nBetter results are generally obtained if the manure is piled under\r\ncover. If the weather is cold and fermentation does not start readily,\r\nwetting the pile with hot water may start it. The first fermentation is\r\nnearly always irregular; that is, it begins unequally in several places\r\nin the pile. In order to make the fermentation uniform, the pile must\r\nbe turned occasionally, taking care to break up all hard lumps and to\r\ndistribute the hot manure throughout the mass. It is sometimes\r\nnecessary to turn the pile five or six times before it is finally used,\r\nalthough half this number of turnings is ordinarily sufficient. When\r\nthe pile is steaming uniformly throughout, it is placed in the hotbed,\r\nand is covered with the earth in which the plants are to be grown.\r\n\r\nHotbed frames are sometimes set on top of the pile of fermenting\r\nmanure, as shown in Fig. 204. The manure should extend some distance\r\nbeyond the edges of the frame; otherwise the frame will become too cold\r\nabout the outside, and the plants will suffer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 205. Section of a hotbed built with a pit.]\r\n\r\nIt is preferable, however, to have a pit beneath the frame in which the\r\nmanure is placed. If the bed is to be started in midwinter or very\r\nearly in the spring, it is advisable to make this pit in the fall and\r\nto fill it with straw or other litter to prevent the earth from\r\nfreezing deep. When it is time to make the bed, the litter is thrown\r\nout, and the ground is warm and ready to receive the fermenting manure.\r\nThe pit should be a foot wider on either side than the width of the\r\nframe. Fig. 205 is a cross-section of such a hotbed pit. Upon the\r\nground a layer of an inch or two of any coarse material is placed to\r\nkeep the manure off the cold earth. Upon this, from twelve to thirty\r\ninches of manure is placed. Above the manure is a thin layer of\r\nleafmold or some porous material, that will serve as a distributor of\r\nthe heat, and above this is four or five inches of soft garden loam, in\r\nwhich the plants are to be grown.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to place the manure in the pit in layers, each stratum\r\nto be thoroughly trodden down before another one is put in. These\r\nlayers should be four to eight inches in thickness. By this means the\r\nmass is easily made uniform in consistency. Manure that has too much\r\nstraw for the best results, and which will therefore soon part with its\r\nheat, will spring up quickly when the pressure of the feet is removed.\r\nManure that has too little straw, and which therefore will not heat\r\nwell or will spend its heat quickly, will pack down into a soggy mass\r\nunderneath the feet. When the manure has sufficient litter, it will\r\ngive a springy feeling to the feet as a person walks over it, but will\r\nnot fluff up when the pressure is removed. The quantity of manure to be\r\nused will depend on its quality, and also on the season in which the\r\nhotbed is made. The earlier the bed is made, the larger should be the\r\nquantity of manure. Hotbeds that are intended to hold for two months\r\nshould have about two feet of manure, as a rule.\r\n\r\nThe manure will ordinarily heat very vigorously for a few days after it\r\nis placed in the bed. A soil thermometer should be thrust through the\r\nearth down to the manure, and the frame kept tightly closed. When the\r\ntemperature is passing below 90°, seeds of the warm plants, like\r\ntomatoes, may be sown, and when it passes below 80° or 70°, the seeds\r\nof cooler plants may be sown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 206 Parallel runs of hotbeds with racks for holding\r\nsashes.]\r\n\r\nIf hotbeds are to be used every year, permanent pits should be provided\r\nfor them. Pits are made from two to three feet deep, preferably the\r\nformer depth, and are walled up with stone or brick. It is important\r\nthat they be given good drainage from below. In the summer-time, after\r\nthe sash are stripped, the old beds may be used for the growing of\r\nvarious delicate crops, as melons or half-hardy flowers. In this\r\nposition, the plants can be protected in the fall. As already\r\nsuggested, the pits should be cleaned out in the fall and filled with\r\nlitter to facilitate the work of making the new bed in the winter or\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 207. Manure-heated greenhouse.]\r\n\r\nVarious modifications of the common type of hotbed will suggest\r\nthemselves to the operator. The frames should ordinarily run in\r\nparallel rows, so that a man walking between them can attend to the\r\nventilation of two rows of sash at once. Fig. 206 shows a different\r\narrangement. There are two parallel runs, with walks on the outside,\r\nand between them are racks to receive the sash from the adjacent\r\nframes. The sash from the left-hand bed are run to the right, and those\r\nfrom the right-hand bed are run to the left. Running on racks, the\r\noperator does not need to handle them, and the breakage of glass is\r\ntherefore less; but this system is little used because of the\r\ndifficulty of reaching the farther side of the bed from the single\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nIf the hotbed were high enough and broad enough to allow a man to work\r\ninside, we should have a forcing-house. Such a structure is shown in\r\nFig. 207, upon one side of which the manure and soil are already in\r\nplace. These manure-heated houses are often very efficient, and are a\r\ngood make-shift until such time as the gardener can afford to put in\r\nflue or pipe heat.\r\n\r\nHotbeds may be heated by means of steam or hot water. They can be piped\r\nfrom the heater in a dwelling-house or greenhouse. Fig. 208 shows a\r\nhotbed with two pipes, in the positions 7, 7 beneath the bed. The earth\r\nis shown at 4, and the plants (which, in this case, are vines) are\r\ngrowing upon a rack, at 6. There are doors in the end of the house,\r\nshown in 2, 2, which may be used for ventilation or for admitting air\r\nunderneath the beds. The pipes should not be surrounded by earth, but\r\nshould run through a free air space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 208. Pipe-heated hotbed.]\r\n\r\nIt would scarcely pay to put in a hot water or steam heater for the\r\nexpress purpose of heating hotbeds, for if such an expense were\r\nincurred, it would be better to make a forcing-house. Hotbeds may be\r\nheated, however, with hot-air flues with very good results. A home-made\r\nbrick furnace may be constructed in a pit at one end of the run and\r\nunderneath a shed, and the smoke and hot air, instead of being carried\r\ndirectly upwards, is carried through a slightly rising horizontal pipe\r\nthat runs underneath the beds. For some distance from the furnace, this\r\nflue may be made of brick or unvitrified sewer pipe, but stove-pipe may\r\nbe used for the greater part of the run. The chimney is ordinarily at\r\nthe farther end of the run of beds. It should be high, in order to\r\nprovide a good draft. If the run of beds is long, there should be a\r\nrise in the underlying pipe of at least one foot in twenty-five. The\r\ngreater the rise in this pipe, the more perfect will be the draft. If\r\nthe runs are not too long, the underlying pipe may return underneath\r\nthe beds and enter a chimney directly over the back end of the furnace,\r\nand such a chimney, being warmed from the furnace, will ordinarily have\r\nan excellent draft. The underlying pipe should occupy a free space or\r\npit beneath the beds, and whenever it lies near to the floor of the bed\r\nor is very hot, it should be covered with asbestos cloth. While such\r\nflue-heated hotbeds may be eminently successful with a grower or\r\nbuilder of experience, it may nevertheless be said, as a general\r\nstatement, that whenever such trouble and expense are incurred, it is\r\nbetter to make a forcing-house. The subject of forcing-houses and\r\ngreenhouses is not discussed in this book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 209. Useful kinds of watering-pots. These are\r\nadapted to different uses, as are different forms of hoes or pruning\r\ntools.]\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory material for use in hotbed and cold-frame sash is\r\ndouble-thick, second-quality glass; and panes twelve inches wide are\r\nordinarily broad enough, and they suffer comparatively little in\r\nbreakage. For coldframes, however, various oiled papers and waterproof\r\ncloths may be used, particularly for plants that are started little in\r\nadvance of the opening of the season. When these materials are used, it\r\nis not necessary to have expensive sash, but rectangular frames are\r\nmade from strips of pine seven-eighths inch thick and two and one-half\r\ninches wide, halved together at the corners and each corner reënforced\r\nby a square carriage-corner, such as is used by carriage-makers to\r\nsecure the corners of buggy boxes. These corners can be bought by the\r\npound at hardware stores.\r\n\r\nManagement of hotbeds.\r\n\r\nClose attention is required in the management of hotbeds, to insure\r\nthat they do not become too hot when the sun comes out suddenly, and to\r\ngive plenty of fresh air.\r\n\r\nVentilation is usually effected by raising the sash at the upper end\r\nand letting it rest upon a block. Whenever the temperature is above\r\nfreezing point, it is generally advisable to take the sash off part\r\nway, as shown in the central part of Fig. 199, or even to strip it off\r\nentirely, as shown in Fig. 197.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken not to water the plants at nightfall, especially\r\nin dull and cold weather, but to give them water in the morning, when\r\nthe sun will soon bring the temperature up to its normal state. Skill\r\nand judgment in watering are of the greatest importance in the\r\nmanagement of hotbeds; but this skill comes only from thoughtful\r\npractice. The satisfaction and effectiveness of the work are greatly\r\nincreased by good hose connections and good watering-pots (Fig. 209).\r\n\r\nSome protection, other than the glass, must be given to hotbeds. They\r\nneed covering on every cold night, and sometimes during the entire day\r\nin very severe weather. Very good material for covering the sash is\r\nmatting, such as is used for covering floors. Old pieces of carpet may\r\nalso be used. Various hotbed mattings are sold by dealers in gardeners’\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 210. The making of straw mats.]\r\n\r\nGardeners often make mats of rye straw, although the price of good\r\nstraw and the excellence of manufactured materials make this home-made\r\nmatting less desirable than formerly. Such mats are thick and durable,\r\nand are rolled up in the morning, as shown in Fig. 199. There are\r\nvarious methods of making these straw mats, but Fig. 210 illustrates\r\none of the best. A frame is made after the manner of a saw-horse, with\r\na double top, and tarred or marline twine is used for securing the\r\nstrands of straw. It is customary to use six runs of this warp. Twelve\r\nspools of string are provided, six hanging on either side. Some persons\r\nwind the cord upon two twenty-penny nails, as shown in the figure,\r\nthese nails being held together at one end by wire which is secured in\r\nnotches filed into them. The other ends of the spikes are free, and\r\nallow the string to be caught between them, thus preventing the balls\r\nfrom unwinding as they hang upon the frame. Two wisps of straight rye\r\nstraw are secured and laid upon the frame, with the butt ends outward\r\nand the heads overlapping. Two opposite spools are then brought up, and\r\na hard knot is tied at each point. The projecting butts of the straw\r\nare then cut off with a hatchet, and the mat is allowed to drop through\r\nto receive the next pair of wisps. In making these mats, it is\r\nessential that the rye contains no ripe grain; otherwise it attracts\r\nthe mice. It is best to grow rye for this especial purpose, and to cut\r\nit before the grain is in the milk, so that the straw does not need to\r\nbe threshed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these coverings of straw or matting, it is sometimes\r\nnecessary to provide board shutters to protect the beds, particularly\r\nif the plants are started very early in the season. These shutters are\r\nmade of half-inch or five-eighths-inch pine lumber, and are the same\r\nsize as the sash—three by six feet. They may be placed upon the sash\r\nunderneath the matting, or they may be used above the matting. In some\r\ncases they are used without any matting.\r\n\r\nIn the growing of plants in hotbeds, every effort should be made to\r\nprevent the plants from growing spindling, or becoming “drawn.” To make\r\nstocky plants, it is necessary to give room to each plant, to be sure\r\nthat the distance from the plants to the glass is not great, to provide\r\nnot too much water in dull and cold weather, and particularly to give\r\nabundance of air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nPROTECTING PLANTS FROM THINGS THAT PREY ON THEM\r\n\r\nPlants are preyed on by insects and fungi; and they are subject to\r\nvarious kinds of disease that, for the most part, are not yet\r\nunderstood. They are often injured also by mice and rabbits (p. 144),\r\nby moles, dogs, cats, and chickens; and fruit is eaten by birds. Moles\r\nmay be troublesome on sandy land; they heave the ground by their\r\nburrowing and may often be killed by stamping when the burrow is being\r\nraised; there are mole traps that are more or less successful. Dogs and\r\ncats work injury mostly by walking across newly made gardens or lying\r\nin them. These animals, as well as chickens, should be kept within\r\ntheir proper place (p. 160); or if they roam at will, the garden must\r\nbe inclosed in a tight wire fence or the beds protected by brush laid\r\nclosely over them.\r\n\r\nThe insects and diseases that attack garden plants are legion; and yet,\r\nfor the most part, they are not very difficult to combat if one is\r\ntimely and thorough in his operations. These difficulties may be\r\ndivided into three great categories: the injuries wrought by insects;\r\nthe injuries of parasitic fungi; the various types of so-called\r\nconstitutional diseases, some of which are caused by germs or bacteria,\r\nand many of which have not yet been worked out by investigators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 211. Shot-hole disease of plum.] [Illustration:\r\nFig. 212. Hollyhock rust.]\r\n\r\nThe diseases caused by parasitic fungi are usually distinguished by\r\ndistinct marks, spots or blisters on the leaves or stems, and the\r\ngradual weakening or death of the part; and, in many cases, the leaves\r\ndrop bodily. For the most part, these spots on the leaves or stems\r\nsooner or later exhibit a mildew-like or rusty appearance, due to the\r\ndevelopment of the spores or fruiting bodies. Fig. 211 illustrates the\r\nravages of one of the parasitic fungi, the shot-hole fungus of the\r\nplum. Each spot probably represents a distinct attack of the fungus,\r\nand in this particular disease these injured parts of tissue are liable\r\nto fall out, leaving holes in the leaf. Plum leaves that are attacked\r\nearly in the season by this disease usually drop prematurely; but\r\nsometimes the leaves persist, being riddled by holes at the close of\r\nthe season. Fig. 212 is the rust of the hollyhock. In this case the\r\npustules of the fungus are very definite on the under side of the leaf.\r\nThe blisters of leaf-curl are shown in Fig. 213. The ragged work of\r\napple scab fungus is shown in Fig. 214.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 213. Leaf-curl of peach, due to a fungus.]\r\n\r\nThe constitutional and bacterial diseases usually affect the whole\r\nplant, or at least large portions of it; and the seat of attack is\r\ncommonly not so much in the individual leaves as in the stems, the\r\nsources of food supply being thereby cut off from the foliage. The\r\nsymptoms of this class of diseases are general weakening of plant when\r\nthe disease affects the plant as a whole or when it attacks large\r\nbranches; or sometimes the leaves shrivel and die about the edges or in\r\nlarge irregular discolored spots, but without the distinct pustular\r\nmarks of the parasitic fungi. There is a general tendency for the\r\nfoliage on plants affected with such diseases to shrivel and to hang on\r\nthe stem for a time. One of the best illustrations of this type of\r\ndisease is the pear-blight. Sometimes the plant gives rise to abnormal\r\ngrowths, as in the “willow shoots” of peaches affected with yellows\r\n(Fig. 215).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 214. Leaves and fruits injured by fungi, chiefly\r\napple-scab.]\r\n\r\nAnother class of diseases are the root-galls. They are of various\r\nkinds. The root-gall of raspberries, crown-gall of peaches, apples, and\r\nother trees, is the most popularly recognized of this class of troubles\r\n(Fig. 216). It has long been known as a disease of nursery stock. Many\r\nstates have laws against the sale of trees showing this disease. Its\r\ncause was unknown, until in 1907 Smith and Townsend, of the Bureau of\r\nPlant Industry, United States Department of Agriculture, undertook an\r\ninvestigation. They proved that it is a bacterial disease (caused by\r\n_Bacterium tumefaciens_); but just how the bacteria gain entrance to\r\nthe root is not known. The same bacterium may cause galls on the stems\r\nof other plants, as, for example, on certain of the daisies. The\r\n“hairy-root” of apples, and certain galls that often appear on the\r\nlimbs of large apple-trees, are also known to be caused by this same\r\nbacterium. The disease seems to be most serious and destructive on the\r\nraspberry, particularly the Cuthbert variety. The best thing to be done\r\nwhen the raspberry patch becomes infested is to root out the plants and\r\ndestroy them, planting a new patch with clean stock on land that has\r\nnot grown berries for some time. Notwithstanding the laws that have\r\nbeen made against the distribution of root-gall from nurseries, the\r\nevidence seems to show that it is not a serious disease of apples or\r\npeaches, at least not in the northeastern United States. It is not\r\ndetermined how far it may injure such trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 215. The slender tufted growth indicating peach\r\nyellows. The cause of this disease is undetermined.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 216. Gall on a raspberry root.] [Illustration: Fig.\r\n217. Canker-worm.]\r\n\r\nOf obvious insect injuries, there are two general types,—those wrought\r\nby insects that bite or chew their food, as the ordinary beetles and\r\nworms, and those wrought by insects that puncture the surface of the\r\nplant and derive their food by sucking the juices, as scale-insects and\r\nplant-lice. The canker-worm (Fig. 217) is a notable example of the\r\nformer class; and many of these insects may be dispatched by the\r\napplication of poison to the parts that they eat. It is apparent,\r\nhowever, that insects which suck the juice of the plant are not\r\npoisoned by any liquid that may be applied to the surface. They may be\r\nkilled by various materials that act upon them externally, as the soap\r\nwashes, miscible oils, kerosene emulsions, lime-and-sulfur sprays, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nThere has been much activity in recent years in the identification and\r\nstudy of insects, fungi, and microorganisms that injure plants; and\r\ngreat numbers of bulletins and monographs have been published; and yet\r\nthe gardener who has tried assiduously to follow these investigations\r\nis likely to go to his garden any morning and find troubles that he\r\ncannot identify and which perhaps even an investigator himself might\r\nnot understand. It is important, therefore, that the gardener inform\r\nhimself not only on particular kinds of insects and diseases, but that\r\nhe develop a resourcefulness of his own. He should be able to do\r\nsomething, even if he does not know a complete remedy or specific. Some\r\nof the procedure, preventive and remedial, that needs always to be\r\nconsidered, is as follows:—\r\n\r\nKeep the place clean, and free from infection. Next to keeping the\r\nplants vigorous and strong, this is the first and best means of\r\naverting trouble from insects and fungi. Rubbish and all places in\r\nwhich the insects can hibernate and the fungi can propagate should be\r\ndone away with. All fallen leaves from plants that have been attacked\r\nby fungi should be raked up and burned, and in the fall all diseased\r\nwood should be cut out and destroyed. It is important that diseased\r\nplants are not thrown on the manure heap, to be distributed through the\r\ngarden the following season.\r\n\r\nPractice a rotation or alternation of crops (p. 114). Some of the\r\ndiseases remain in the soil and attack the plant year after year.\r\nWhenever any crop shows signs of root disease, or soil disease, it is\r\nparticularly important that another crop be grown on the place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 218. A garden hand syringe.] [Illustration: Fig.\r\n219. A knapsack pump.]\r\n\r\nSee that the disease or insect is not bred on weeds or other plants\r\nthat are botanically related to the crop you grow. If the wild mallow,\r\nor plant known to children as “cheeses” _(Malva rotundifolia_), is\r\ndestroyed, there will be much less difficulty with hollyhock rust. Do\r\nnot let the cabbage club-root disease breed on wild turnips and other\r\nmustards, or black-knot on plum sprouts and wild cherries, or\r\ntent-caterpillars on wild cherries and other trees.\r\n\r\nAlways be ready to resort to hand-picking. We have grown so accustomed\r\nto killing insects by other means that we have almost forgotten that\r\nhand-picking is often the surest and sometimes even the most\r\nexpeditious means of checking an invasion in a home garden. Many\r\ninsects can be jarred off early in the morning. Egg-masses on leaves\r\nand stems may be removed. Cutworms may be dug out. Diseased leaves may\r\nbe picked off and burned; this will do much to combat the hollyhock\r\nrust, aster rust, and other infections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 220 A compressed-air hand pump for garden work.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 221 A bucket pump.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 222 A bucket pump.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 223 A cart-mounted pump.]\r\n\r\nKeep close watch on the plants, and be prepared to strike quickly. It\r\nshould be a matter of pride to a gardener to have in his workhouse a\r\nsupply of the common insecticides and fungicides (Paris green or\r\narsenate of lead, some of the tobacco preparations, white hellebore,\r\nwhale-oil soap, bordeaux mixture, flowers of sulfur, carbonate of\r\nCopper for solution in ammonia), and also a good hand syringe (Fig.\r\n218), a knapsack pump (Figs. 219, 220), a bucket pump (Figs. 221, 222),\r\na hand bellows or powder gun, perhaps a barrow outfit (Figs. 223, 224,\r\n225), and if the plantation is large enough, some kind of a force pump\r\n(Figs. 226, 227, 228). If one is always ready, there is little danger\r\nfrom any insect or disease that is controllable by spraying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 224. A garden outfit.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 225. A cart-mounted barrel pump.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 226. A barrel hand pump.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 227. A barrel outfit, showing nozzles on extension\r\nrods for trees.] [Illustration: Fig. 228. A truck-mounted barrel hand\r\nspray Pump.]\r\n\r\n_Screens and covers_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 229. Wire-covered box for protecting plants from\r\ninsects.]\r\n\r\nThere are various ways of keeping insects away from plants. One of the\r\nbest is to cover the plants with fine mosquito-netting or to grow them\r\nin hand-frames, or to use a wire-covered box like that shown in Fig.\r\n229. In growing plants under such covers, care must be taken that the\r\nplants are not kept too close or confined; and in cases in which the\r\ninsects hibernate in the soil, these boxes, by keeping the soil warm,\r\nmay cause the insects to hatch all the sooner. In most cases, however,\r\nthese covers are very efficient, especially for keeping the striped\r\nbugs off young plants of melons and cucumbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 230 Protecting from cut-worms.]\r\n\r\nCut-worms may be kept away from plants by placing sheets of tin or of\r\nheavy glazed paper about the stem of the plant, as shown in Fig. 230.\r\nClimbing cut-worms are kept off young trees by the means shown in Fig.\r\n231. Or a roll of cotton may be placed about the trunk of the tree, a\r\nstring being tied on the lower edge of the roll and the upper edge of\r\nthe cotton turned down like the top of a boot; the insects cannot crawl\r\nover this obstruction (p. 203).\r\n\r\nThe maggots that attack the roots of cabbages and cauliflowers may be\r\nkept from the plant by pieces of tarred paper, which are placed close\r\nabout the stem upon the surface of the ground. Fig. 232 illustrates a\r\nhexagon of paper, and also shows a tool used for cutting it. This means\r\nof preventing the attacks of the cabbage maggot is described in detail\r\nby the late Professor Goff (for another method of controlling cabbage\r\nmaggot see p. 201):—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 231 Protecting trees from cut-worms.]\r\n\r\n“The cards are cut in a hexagonal form, in order better to economize\r\nthe material, and a thinner grade of tarred paper than the ordinary\r\nroofing felt is used, as it is not only cheaper, but being more\r\nflexible, the cards made from it are more readily placed about the\r\nplant without being torn. The blade of the tool, which should be made\r\nby an expert blacksmith, is formed from a band of steel, bent in the\r\nform of a half hexagon, and then taking an acute angle, reaches nearly\r\nto the center, as shown in Fig. 232. The part making the star-shaped\r\ncut is formed from a separate piece of steel, so attached to the handle\r\nas to make a close joint with the blade. The latter is beveled from the\r\noutside all round, so that by removing the part making the star-shaped\r\ncut, the edge may be ground on a grindstone. It is important that the\r\nangles in the blade be made perfect, and that its outline represents an\r\nexact half hexagon. To use the tool, place the tarred paper on the end\r\nof a section of a log or piece of timber and first cut the lower edge\r\ninto notches, as indicated at _a_, Fig. 232, using only one angle of\r\nthe tool. Then commence at the left side and place the blade as\r\nindicated by the dotted lines, and strike at the end of the handle with\r\na light mallet, and a complete card is made. Continue in this manner\r\nacross the paper. The first cut of every alternate course will make an\r\nimperfect card, and the last cut in any course may be imperfect, but\r\nthe other cuts will make perfect cards if the tool is correctly made,\r\nand properly used. The cards should be placed about the plants at the\r\ntime of transplanting. To place the card, bend it slightly to open the\r\nslit, then slip it on to the center, the stem entering the slit, after\r\nwhich spread the card out flat, and press the points formed by the\r\nstar-shaped cut snugly around the stem.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 232 Showing how paper is cut for protecting\r\ncabbages from maggots. The Goff device.]\r\n\r\n_Fumigating_.\r\n\r\nAn effective means of destroying insects in glass houses is by\r\nfumigating with various kinds of smoke or vapors. The best material to\r\nuse for general purposes is some form of tobacco or tobacco compounds.\r\nThe old method of fumigating with tobacco is to burn slowly slightly\r\ndampened tobacco stems in a kettle or scuttle, allowing the house to be\r\nfilled with the pungent smoke. Lately, however, fluid extracts and\r\nother preparations of tobacco have been brought into use, and these are\r\nso effective that the tobacco-stem method is becoming obsolete. The use\r\nof hydrocyanic acid gas in greenhouses is now coming to be common, for\r\nplant-lice, white-fly, and other insects. It is also used to fumigate\r\nnursery stock for San José scale, and mills and dwellings for such\r\npests and vermin as become established in them. The following\r\ndirections are from Cornell Bulletin 252 (from which the formulas in\r\nthe succeeding pages, and most of the advice, are also taken):—\r\n\r\n“No general formula can be given for fumigating the different kinds of\r\nplants grown in greenhouses, as the species and varieties differ\r\ngreatly in their ability to withstand the effects of the gas. Ferns and\r\nroses are very susceptible to injury, and fumigation if attempted at\r\nall should be performed with great caution. Fumigation will not kill\r\ninsect eggs and thus must be repeated when the new brood appears.\r\nFumigate only at night when there is no wind. Have the house as dry as\r\npossible and the temperature as near 60° as practicable.\r\n\r\n“Hydrocyanic acid gas is a deadly poison, and the greatest care is\r\nrequired in its use. Always use 98 to 100 per cent pure potassium\r\ncyanide and a good grade of commercial sulfuric acid. The chemicals are\r\nalways combined in the following proportion: Potassium cyanide, 1 oz.;\r\nsulfuric acid, 2 fluid oz.; water, 4 fluid oz. Always use an earthen\r\ndish, _pour in the water first_, and add the sulfuric acid to it. Put\r\nthe required amount of cyanide in a thin paper bag and when all is\r\nready, drop it into the liquid and leave the room immediately. For\r\nmills and dwellings, use 1 oz. of cyanide for every 100 cu. ft. of\r\nspace. Make the doors and windows as tight as possible by pasting\r\nstrips of paper over the cracks. Remove the silverware and food, and if\r\nbrass and nickel work cannot be removed, cover with vaseline. Place the\r\nproper amount of the acid and water for every room in 2-gal. jars. Use\r\ntwo or more in large rooms or halls. Weigh out the potassium cyanide in\r\npaper bags, and place them near the jars. When all is ready, drop the\r\ncyanide into the jars, beginning on the top floors, since the fumes are\r\nlighter than air. In large buildings, it is frequently necessary to\r\nsuspend the bags of cyanide over the jars by cords running through\r\nscrew eyes and all leading to a place near the door. By cutting all the\r\ncords at once the cyanide will be lowered into the jars and the\r\noperator may escape without injury. Let the fumigation continue all\r\nnight, locking all outside doors and placing danger signs on the\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nIn greenhouses, the white-fly on cucumbers and tomatoes may be killed\r\nby overnight fumigation with 1 oz. of potassium cyanide to every 1000\r\ncu. ft. of space; or with a kerosene emulsion spray or whale-oil soap,\r\non plants not injured by these materials.\r\n\r\nThe green aphis is dispatched in houses by fumigation with any of the\r\ntobacco preparations; on violets, by fumigation with 1/2 to 3/4 oz.\r\npotassium cyanide for every 1000 cu. ft. of space, leaving the gas in\r\nfrom 1/2 to 1 hr.\r\n\r\nThe black aphis is more difficult to kill than the green aphis, but may\r\nbe controlled by the same methods thoroughly used.\r\n\r\n_Soaking tubers and seeds_.\r\n\r\nPotato scab may be prevented, so far as planting infected “seed” is\r\nconcerned, by soaking the seed tubers for half an hour in 30 gal. of\r\nwater containing 1 pt. of commercial (about 40 per cent) formalin. Oats\r\nand wheat, when attacked by certain kinds of smut, may be rendered safe\r\nto sow by soaking for ten minutes in a similar solution. It is probable\r\nthat some other tubers and seeds can be similarly treated with good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nPotatoes may also be soaked (for scab) one and one-half hours in a\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate, 1 oz. to 7 gal. of water.\r\n\r\n_Spraying_.\r\n\r\nThe most effective means of destroying insects and fungi however, in\r\nany general or large way, is by the use of various sprays. The two\r\ngeneral types of insecticides have already been mentioned—those that\r\nkill by poisoning, and those that kill by destroying the body of the\r\ninsect. Of the former, there are three materials in common use—Paris\r\ngreen, arsenate of lead, and hellebore. Of the latter, the most usual\r\nat present are kerosene emulsion, miscible oils, and the lime-sulfur\r\nwash.\r\n\r\nSprays for fungi usually depend for their efficiency on some form of\r\ncopper or sulfur, or both. For surface mildews, as grape mildew,\r\ndusting flowers of sulfur on the foliage is a protection. In most\r\ncases, however, it is necessary to apply materials in liquid form,\r\nbecause they can be more thoroughly and economically distributed, and\r\nthey adhere to the foliage better. The best general fungicide is the\r\nbordeaux mixture. It is generally, however, not advisable to use the\r\nbordeaux mixture on ornamental plants, because it discolors the foliage\r\nand makes the plants look very untidy. In such cases it is best to use\r\nthe ammoniacal copper solution, which leaves no stain.\r\n\r\nIn all spraying operations it is especially important that the\r\napplications be made the very moment the insect or disease is\r\ndiscovered, or in the case of fungous diseases, if one is expecting an\r\nattack, it is well to make an application of bordeaux mixture even\r\nbefore the disease appears. When the fungus once gets inside the plant\r\ntissue, it is very difficult to destroy it, inasmuch as fungicides act\r\non these deep-seated fungi very largely by preventing their fruiting\r\nand their further spread on the surface of the leaf. For ordinary\r\nconditions, from two to four sprayings are necessary to dispatch the\r\nenemy. In spraying for insects in home gardens, it is often advisable\r\nto make a second application the day following the first one in order\r\nto destroy the remaining insects before they recover from the first\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 233. Cyclone or vermorel type of nozzle, single and\r\nmultiple.]\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of machines and devices for the application of\r\nsprays to plants. For a few individual specimens, the spray may be\r\napplied with a whisk, or with a common garden syringe. If one has a few\r\ntrees to treat, however, it is best to have some kind of bucket pump\r\nlike those shown in Figs. 221, 222. On a lawn or in a small garden a\r\ntank on wheels (Figs. 223, 224, 225) is handy and efficient. In such\r\ncases, or even for larger areas, some of the knapsack pumps (Figs. 219,\r\n220) are very desirable. These machines are always serviceable, because\r\nthe operator stands so near to his work; but as they carry a\r\ncomparatively small quantity of liquid and do not throw it rapidly,\r\nthey are expensive when much work is to be done. Yet, in ordinary home\r\ngrounds, the knapsack pump or compressed-air pump is one of the most\r\nefficient and practicable of all the spraying devices.\r\n\r\nFor large areas, as for small orchards and fields, a barrel pump\r\nmounted on a wagon is best. Common types of barrel pumps are shown in\r\nFigs. 226, 227, 228. Commercial plantations are now sprayed by power\r\nmachines. There are many good patterns of spraying machines, and the\r\nintending purchaser should send for catalogues to the various\r\nmanufacturers. The addresses may be found in the advertising pages of\r\nrural papers.\r\n\r\nAs to nozzles for spraying it may be said that there is no one pattern\r\nthat is best for all purposes. For most uses in home grounds the\r\ncyclone or vermorel type (Fig. 233) will give best satisfaction. The\r\npump manufacturers supply special nozzles for their machines.\r\n\r\n_Insecticide spraying formulas_.\r\n\r\nThe two classes of insecticides are here described,—the poisons\r\n(arsenites and white hellebore) for chewing insects, as the beetles and\r\nall kinds of worms; the contact insecticides, as kerosene, oils, soap,\r\ntobacco, lime-sulfur, for plant-lice, scale, and insects in such\r\nposition that the material cannot be fed to them (as maggots in the\r\nunderground parts).\r\n\r\n_Paris green_.—The standard insecticidal poison. This is used in\r\nvarying strengths, depending on the insect to be controlled and the\r\nkind of plant treated. Mix the Paris green into a paste and then add to\r\nthe water. Keep the mixture thoroughly agitated while spraying. If for\r\nuse on fruit trees, add 1 lb. of quick lime for every pound of Paris\r\ngreen to prevent burning the foliage. For potatoes it is frequently\r\nused alone, but it is much safer to use the lime. Paris green and\r\nbordeaux mixture may be combined without lessening the value of either,\r\nand the caustic action of the arsenic is prevented. The proportion of\r\nthe poison to use is given under the various insects discussed in the\r\nsucceeding pages.\r\n\r\n_Arsenate of lead_.—This can be applied in a stronger mixture than\r\nother arsenical poisons without injuring the foliage. It is, therefore,\r\nmuch used against beetles and other insects that are hard to poison, as\r\nelm-leaf beetle and canker-worm. It comes in the form of a paste and\r\nshould be mixed thoroughly with a small quantity of water before\r\nplacing in the sprayer, else the nozzles will clog. Arsenate of lead\r\nand bordeaux mixture can be combined without lessening the value of\r\neither. It is used in strengths varying from 4 to 10 lb. per 100 gal.,\r\ndepending on the kind of insect to be killed.\r\n\r\nArsenite of soda and arsenite of lime are sometimes used with bordeaux\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\n_White Hellebore_.—For wet application, use fresh white hellebore, 4\r\noz.; water, 2 or 3 gal. For dry application, use hellebore, 1 lb.;\r\nflour or air-slaked lime, 5 lb. This is a white, yellowish powder made\r\nfrom the roots of the white hellebore plant. It loses its strength\r\nafter a time and should be used fresh. It is used as a substitute for\r\nthe arsenical poisons on plants or fruits soon to be eaten, as on\r\ncurrants and gooseberries for the currant-worm.\r\n\r\n_Tobacco_.—This is a valuable insecticide and is used in several forms.\r\nAs a _dust_ it is used extensively in greenhouses for plant-lice, and\r\nin nurseries and about apple trees for the woolly aphis. Tobacco\r\n_decoction_ is made by steeping or soaking the stems in water. It is\r\noften used as a spray against plant-lice. Tobacco in the form of\r\n_extracts_, _punks_, and _powders_ is sold under various trade names\r\nfor use in fumigating greenhouses. (See page 188.)\r\n\r\n_Kerosene emulsion_.—Hard, soft, or whale-oil soap, 1/2 lb.; water, 1\r\ngal.; kerosene, 2 gal. Dissolve the soap in hot water; remove from the\r\nfire and while still hot add the kerosene. Pump the liquid back into\r\nitself for five or ten minutes or until it becomes a creamy mass. If\r\nproperly made, the oil will not separate out on cooling.\r\n\r\nFor use on dormant trees, dilute with 5 to 7 parts of water. For\r\nkilling plant-lice on foliage dilute with 10 to 15 parts of water.\r\nCrude oil emulsion is made in the same way by substituting crude oil in\r\nplace of kerosene. The strength of oil emulsions is frequently\r\nindicated by the percentage of oil in the diluted liquid:—\r\n\r\nFor a 10% emulsion add 17 gal. of water to 3 gal. stock emulsion.\r\nFor a 15% emulsion add 10 1/3 gal. of water to 3 gal. stock emulsion.\r\nFor a 20% emulsion add 7 gal. of water to 3 gal. stock emulsion.\r\nFor a 25% emulsion add 5 gal. of water to 3 gal. stock emulsion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carbolic acid emulsion_.—Soap, 1 lb.; water, 1 gal.; crude carbolic\r\nacid, 1 pt. Dissolve the soap in hot water, add the carbolic acid, and\r\nagitate into an emulsion. For use against root-maggots, dilute with 30\r\nparts of water.\r\n\r\n_Soaps_.—An effective insecticide for plant-lice is _whale-oil soap_.\r\nDissolve in hot water and dilute so as to obtain one pound of soap to\r\nevery five or seven gallons of water. This strength is effective\r\nagainst plant-lice. It should be applied in stronger solutions,\r\nhowever, for scale insects. Home-made soaps and good laundry soaps,\r\nlike Ivory soap, are often as effective as whale-oil soap.\r\n\r\n_Miscible oils_.—There are now on the market a number of preparations\r\nof petroleum and other oils intended primarily for use against the San\r\nJosé scale. They mix readily with cold water and are immediately ready\r\nfor use. While quickly prepared, easily applied, and generally\r\neffective, they cost considerably more than lime-sulfur wash. They are,\r\nhowever, less corrosive to the pumps and more agreeable to use. They\r\nare especially valuable to the man with only a few trees or shrubs who\r\nwould not care to go to the trouble and expense to make up the\r\nlime-sulfur wash. They should be diluted with not more than 10 or 12\r\nparts of water. Use only on dormant trees.\r\n\r\n_Lime and sulfur wash_.—Quicklime, 20 lb.; flowers of sulfur, 15 lb.;\r\nwater, 50 gal. The lime and sulfur must be thoroughly boiled. An iron\r\nkettle is often convenient for the work. Proceed as follows: Place the\r\nlime in the kettle. Add hot water gradually in sufficient quantity to\r\nproduce the most rapid slaking of the lime. When the lime begins to\r\nslake, add the sulfur and stir together. If convenient, keep the\r\nmixture covered with burlap to save the heat. After slaking has ceased,\r\nadd more water and boil the mixture one hour. As the sulfur goes into\r\nsolution, a rich orange-red or dark green color will appear. After\r\nboiling sufficiently, add water to the required amount and strain into\r\nthe spray tank. The wash is most effective when applied warm, but may\r\nbe applied cold. If one has access to a steam boiler, boiling with\r\nsteam is more convenient and satisfactory. Barrels may be used for\r\nholding the mixture, and the steam applied by running a pipe or rubber\r\nhose into the mixture. Proceed in the same way until the lime is\r\nslaked, when the steam may be turned on. Continue boiling for 45 min.\r\nto an hour, or until sulfur is dissolved.\r\n\r\nThis strength can be applied safely only when the trees are dormant. It\r\nis mainly an insecticide for San José scale, although it has\r\nconsiderable value as a fungicide.\r\n\r\n_Lime-sulfur mixtures and solutions for summer spraying_ are now coming\r\nto take the place of bordeaux in many cases. Scott’s self-boiled\r\nlime-sulfur mixture, described in U. S. D. A. Bureau Plant Industry\r\nCirc. 27 is now a standard fungicide for brown-rot and black-spot or\r\nscab of the peach. Concentrated lime-sulfur solutions, either home\r\nboiled or commercial, are effective against apple scab and have the\r\nadvantage of not russeting the fruit. Such concentrates, testing 32°\r\nBaume, should be diluted at about 1 gal. to 30 of water. Apply at same\r\ntime as with bordeaux. Add arsenate of lead as with bordeaux.\r\n\r\n_Fungicide spraying formulas_.\r\n\r\nThe standard fungicide is bordeaux mixture, made in several forms. The\r\nsecond most important fungicide for the home gardener is ammoniacal\r\ncopper carbonate. Sulfur dust (flowers of sulfur) and liver of sulfur\r\n(potassium sulfide) are also useful in dry or wet sprays for surface\r\nmildews. The lime-sulfur wash, primarily an insecticide, also has\r\nfungicidal property.\r\n\r\n_Bordeaux mixture_.—Copper sulfate, 5 lb.; stone lime or quicklime\r\n(unslaked), 5 lb.; water, 50 gal. This formula is the strength usually\r\nrecommended. Stock mixtures of copper sulfate and lime are desirable.\r\nThey are prepared in the following way:—\r\n\r\n(1) Dissolve the required amount of copper sulfate in water in the\r\nproportion of one pound to one gallon several hours before the solution\r\nis needed, the copper sulfate crystals being suspended in a sack near\r\nthe top of the water. A solution of copper sulfate is heavier than\r\nwater. As soon then, as the crystals begin to dissolve the solution\r\nwill sink, keeping water in contact with the crystals. In this way, the\r\ncrystals will dissolve much sooner than if placed in the bottom of the\r\nbarrel of water. In case large quantities of stock solution are needed,\r\ntwo pounds of copper sulfate may be dissolved in one gallon of water.\r\n\r\n(2) Slake the required amount of lime in a tub or trough. Add the water\r\nslowly at first, so that the lime crumbles into a fine powder. If small\r\nquantities of lime are used, hot water is preferred. When completely\r\nslaked, or entirely powdered, add more water. When the lime has slaked\r\nsufficiently, add water to bring it to a thick milk, or to a certain\r\nnumber of gallons. The amount required for each tank of spray mixture\r\ncan be secured approximately from this stock mixture, which should not\r\nbe allowed to dry out.\r\n\r\n(3) Use five gallons of stock solution of copper sulfate for every\r\nfifty gallons of bordeaux required. Pour this into the tank. Add water\r\nuntil the tank is about two-thirds full. From the stock lime mixture\r\ntake the required amount. Knowing the number of pounds of lime in the\r\nstock mixture and the volume of that mixture, one can take out\r\napproximately the number of pounds required. Dilute this a little by\r\nadding water, and strain into the tank. Stir the mixture, and add water\r\nto make the required amount. Experiment stations often recommend the\r\ndiluting of both the copper sulfate solution and the lime mixture to\r\none-half the required amount before pouring together. This is not\r\nnecessary, and is often impracticable for commercial work. It is\r\npreferable to dilute the copper sulfate solution. Never pour together\r\nthe strong stock mixtures and dilute afterward. Bordeaux mixture of\r\nother strengths, as recommended, is made in the same way, except that\r\nthe amounts of copper sulfate and lime are varied.\r\n\r\n(4) It is not necessary to weigh the lime in making bordeaux mixture,\r\nfor a simple test can be used to determine when enough of a stock lime\r\nmixture has been added. Dissolve an ounce of yellow prussiate of potash\r\nin a pint of water and label it “poison.” Cut a V-shaped slit in one\r\nside of the cork so that the liquid may be poured out in drops. Add the\r\nlime mixture to the diluted copper sulfate solution until the\r\nferro-cyanide (or prussiate) test solution _will not turn brown_ when\r\ndropped from the bottle into the mixture. It is always best to add a\r\nconsiderable excess of lime.\r\n\r\n_“Sticker” or adhesive for bordeaux mixture_.—Resin, 2 lb.; sal soda\r\n(crystals), 1 lb.; water, 1 gal. Boil until of a clear brown color—one\r\nto one and one-half hours. Cook in iron kettle in the open. Add this\r\namount to each fifty gallons of bordeaux for onions and cabbage. For\r\nother plants difficult to wet, add this amount to every one hundred\r\ngallons of the mixture. This mixture will prevent the bordeaux from\r\nbeing washed off by the heaviest rains.\r\n\r\n_Ammoniacal copper carbonate_.—Copper carbonate, 5 oz.; ammonia, 3 pt.;\r\nwater, 50 gal. Dilute the ammonia in seven or eight parts of water.\r\nMake a paste of the copper carbonate with a little water. Add the paste\r\nto the diluted ammonia, and stir until dissolved. Add enough water to\r\nmake fifty gallons. This mixture loses strength on standing, and\r\ntherefore should be made as required. It is used in place of bordeaux\r\nwhen one wishes to avoid the coloring of maturing fruits or ornamental\r\nplants. Not as effective as bordeaux.\r\n\r\n_Potassium sulfide_.—Potassium sulfide (liver of sulfur), 3 oz.; water,\r\n10 gal. As this mixture loses strength on standing, it should be made\r\njust before using. It is particularly valuable for the powdery mildew\r\nof many plants, especially gooseberry, carnation rust, rose mildew,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n_Sulfur_.—Sulfur has been found to possess considerable value as a\r\nfungicide. The flowers of sulfur may be sprinkled over the plants,\r\nparticularly when they are wet. It is most effective in hot, dry\r\nweather. In rose houses it is mixed with half its bulk of lime, and\r\nmade into a paste with water. This is painted on the steam pipes. The\r\nfumes destroy mildew on the roses. Mixed with lime, it has proved\r\neffective in the control of onion smut when drilled into the rows with\r\nthe seed. Sulfur is not effective against black-rot of grapes.\r\n\r\n_Treatment for some of the common insects_.\r\n\r\nThe most approved preventive and remedial treatments for such insect\r\npests as are most likely to menace home grounds and plantations are\r\nhere briefly discussed. In case of any unusual difficulty that he\r\ncannot control, the home-maker should take it up with the agricultural\r\nexperiment station in the state, sending good specimens of the insect\r\nfor identification. He should also have the publications of the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThe statements that are here made are intended as advice rather than as\r\ndirections. They are chosen from good authorities (mostly from\r\nSlingerland and Crosby in this case); but the reader must, of course,\r\nassume his own risk in applying them. The effectiveness of any\r\nrecommended treatment depends very largely on the care, thoroughness,\r\nand timeliness with which the work is done; and new methods and\r\npractices are constantly appearing as the result of new investigations.\r\nThe dates given in these directions are for New York.\r\n\r\n_Aphis or plant-louse._—The stock remedies for aphides or plant-lice\r\nare kerosene emulsion and the tobacco preparations. Whale-oil soap is\r\nalso good. The tobacco may be applied as a spray, or in the house as\r\nfumigation; the commercial forms of nicotine are excellent. (See page\r\n194.) Be sure to apply the remedy before the leaves have curled and\r\nafford protection for the lice; be sure, also, to hit the underside of\r\nthe leaves, where the lice usually are. The presence of lice on trees\r\nis sometimes first discovered from the honey-dew that drops on walks.\r\n\r\nUsually the emulsion is diluted with 10-15 parts of water for\r\nplant-lice (see formula, page 194); but some of the species (as the\r\ndark brown cherry-leaf louse) require a stronger emulsion, about 6\r\nparts of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 234. Lady-bird beetle; larva above]\r\n\r\nThe lady-birds (one of which is shown in Fig. 234) destroy great\r\nnumbers of plant-lice, and their presence should therefore be\r\nencouraged.\r\n\r\n_Apple-maggot or “railroad-worm.”_—The small white maggots make\r\nbrownish winding burrows in the flesh of the fruit, particularly in\r\nsummer and early fall varieties. This insect cannot be reached by a\r\nspray as the parent fly inserts her eggs under the skin of the apple.\r\nWhen full-grown, the maggot leaves the fruit, passes into the ground,\r\nand there transforms inside a tough, leathery case. Tillage has been\r\nfound to be of no value as a means of control. The only effective\r\ntreatment is to pick up all windfalls every two or three days, and\r\neither to feed them out or to bury them deeply, thus killing the\r\nmaggots.\r\n\r\n_Asparagus beetle_.—Clean cultural methods are usually sufficient to\r\nprevent the asparagus beetle’s seriously injuring well-established\r\nbeds. Young plants require more or less protection. A good grade of\r\narsenate of lead, 1 lb. to 25 gal. of water, will quickly destroy the\r\ngrubs on the foliage of either young or old plants. Apply it with an\r\nordinary sprinkling can, or better, use one of the numerous spraying\r\ndevices now on the market. The necessity for treatment must be\r\ndetermined by the abundance of the pests. They should not be permitted\r\nto become abundant in midsummer or the over-wintering beetles may\r\ninjure the shoots in the spring.\r\n\r\n_Blister-mite on apple and pear_.—The presence of this minute mite is\r\nindicated by small irregular brownish blisters on the leaves. Spray in\r\nlate fall or early spring with the lime-sulfur wash, with kerosene\r\nemulsion, diluted with 5 parts of water, or miscible oil, 1 gal. in 10\r\ngal. of water.\r\n\r\n_Borers_.—The only certain remedy for borers is to dig them out, or to\r\npunch them out with a wire. Keep the space about the base of the tree\r\nclean, and watch closely for any sign of borers. The flat-headed borer\r\nof the apple works under the bark on the trunk and larger branches,\r\nparticularly where much exposed to sun. The dead and sunken appearance\r\nof the bark indicates its presence. The round-headed borer works in the\r\nwood of apples, quinces, and other trees; it should be hunted for every\r\nspring and fall. On hard land, it is well to dig the earth away from\r\nthe base of the tree and fill the space with coal ashes; this will make\r\nthe work of examination much easier.\r\n\r\nThe peach and apricot borer is the larva of a clear-wing moth. The\r\nlarva burrows just under the bark near or beneath the surface of the\r\nground; its presence is indicated by a gummy mass at the base of the\r\ntree. Dig out the borers in June and mound up the trees. At the same\r\ntime, apply gas-tar or coal-tar to the trunk from the roots to a foot\r\nor more above the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe bronze birch borer is destroying many fine white birch trees in\r\nsome parts of the country. Its presence is known by the dying of the\r\ntop of the tree. There yet is no known way of preventing this borer\r\nfrom attacking white birches, and the only practicable and effective\r\nmethod so far found for checking its ravages is promptly to cut and\r\nburn the infested trees in autumn, in winter, or before May 1. There is\r\nno probability of saving a tree when the top branches are dead,\r\nalthough cutting out the dead parts may stay the trouble temporarily.\r\nCut and burn such trees at once and thus prevent the spread of the\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\n_Bud-moth on apple_.—The small brown caterpillars with black heads\r\ndevour the tender leaves and flowers of the opening apple buds in early\r\nspring. Make two applications of either 1 lb. Paris green or 4 lb.\r\narsenate of lead in 100 gal. of water; the first when the leaf-tips\r\nappear and the second just before the blossoms open. If necessary,\r\nspray again after the blossoms fall.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage and cauliflower insects_.—The green caterpillars that eat\r\ncabbage leaves and heads hatch from eggs laid by the common white\r\nbutterfly (Fig. 295). There are several broods every season. If plants\r\nare not heading, spray with kerosene emulsion or with Paris green to\r\nwhich the sticker has been added. If heading, apply hellebore.\r\n\r\nThe cabbage aphides, small mealy plant-lice, are especially troublesome\r\nduring cool, dry seasons when their natural enemies are less active.\r\nBefore the plants begin to head, spray with kerosene emulsion diluted\r\nwith 6 parts of water, or whale-oil soap, 1 lb. in 6 gal. of water.\r\n\r\nThe white maggots that feed on the roots hatch from eggs laid near the\r\nplant at the surface of the ground by a small fly somewhat resembling\r\nthe common house fly. Hollow out the earth slightly around every plant\r\nand freely apply carbolic acid emulsion diluted with 30 parts of water.\r\nBegin the treatment early, a day or two after the plants are up or the\r\nnext day after they are set out. Repeat the application every 7 to 10\r\ndays until the latter part of May. It has also been found to be\r\npracticable to protect the plants by the use of tightly fitting cards\r\ncut from tarred paper. (See page 187.)\r\n\r\n_Canker-worms._—These caterpillars are small measuring-worms or loopers\r\nthat defoliate apple trees in May and June (Fig. 217). The female moths\r\nare wingless, and in late fall or early spring crawl up the trunks of\r\nthe trees to lay their eggs on the branches. Spray thoroughly once or\r\ntwice, before the blossoms open, with 1 lb. Paris green or 4 lb.\r\narsenate of lead in 100 gal. of water. Repeat the application after the\r\nblossoms fall. Prevent the ascent of the wingless females by means of\r\nsticky bands or wire-screen traps.\r\n\r\n_Case-bearers on apple_.—The small caterpillars live in pistol-shaped\r\nor cigar-shaped cases, about 1/4 in. long. They appear in spring on the\r\nopening buds at the same time as the bud-moth and may be controlled by\r\nthe same means.\r\n\r\n_Codlin-moth._—The codlin-moth lays the eggs that produce the pinkish\r\ncaterpillar which causes a large proportion of wormy apples and pears.\r\nThe eggs are laid by a small moth on the leaves and on the skin of the\r\nfruit. Most of the caterpillars enter the apple at the blossom end.\r\nWhen the petals fall, the calyx is open and this is the time to spray.\r\nThe calyx soon closes and keeps the poison inside ready for the young\r\ncaterpillar’s first meal. After the calyx has closed, it is too late to\r\nspray effectively. The caterpillars become full grown in July and\r\nAugust, leave the fruit, crawl down on the trunk, and there most of\r\nthem spin cocoons under the loose bark. In most parts of the country\r\nthere are two broods annually. Immediately after the blossoms fall,\r\nspray with 1 lb. Paris green or 4 lb. arsenate of lead in 100 gal. of\r\nwater. Repeat the application 7 to 10 days later. Use burlap bands on\r\ntrunks, killing all caterpillars under them every ten days from July 1\r\nto August 1, and once later before winter.\r\n\r\n_Cucurbit (cucumber, melon, and squash) insects_.—Yellow, black-striped\r\nbeetles appear in numbers and attack the plants as soon as they are up.\r\nPlant early squashes as a trap-crop around the field. Protect the vines\r\nwith screens (Fig. 229) until they begin to run, or keep them covered\r\nwith bordeaux mixture, thus making them distasteful to the beetles.\r\n\r\nSquash vines are frequently killed by a white caterpillar that burrows\r\nin the stem near the base of the plant. Plant a few early squashes\r\nbetween the rows of the late varieties as a trap-crop. As soon as the\r\nearly crop is harvested, remove and burn the vines. When the vines are\r\nlong enough, cover them at the joints with earth in order to develop\r\nsecondary root systems for the plant in case the main stem is injured.\r\n\r\nDark green plant-lice feed on the under sides of squash leaves, causing\r\nthem to curl and wither. Spray with kerosene emulsion diluted with 6\r\nparts of water. It is necessary thoroughly to cover the under side of\r\nthe leaves; the sprayer, therefore, must be fitted with an upturned\r\nnozzle. Burn the vines as soon as the crop is harvested and keep down\r\nall weeds.\r\n\r\nThe stink-bug is very troublesome to squashes. The rusty-black adult\r\nemerges from hibernation in spring and lays its eggs on the under side\r\nof the leaves. The nymphs suck the sap from the leaves and stalks,\r\ncausing serious injury. Trap the adults under boards in the spring.\r\nExamine the leaves for the smooth shining brownish eggs and destroy\r\nthem. The young nymphs may be killed with kerosene emulsion.\r\n\r\n_Curculio_.—The adult curculio of the plum and peach is a small\r\nsnout-beetle that inserts its eggs under the skin of the fruit and then\r\nmakes a characteristic crescent-shaped cut beneath it. The grub feeds\r\nwithin the fruit and causes it to drop. When full grown, it enters the\r\nground, changes in late summer to the beetle, which finally goes into\r\nhibernation in sheltered places. Spray plums just after blossoms fall\r\nwith arsenate of lead, 6 to 8 lb. in 100 gal. of water, and repeat the\r\napplication in about a week. After the fruit has set, jar the trees\r\ndaily over a sheet or curculio-catcher and destroy the beetles; this is\r\npractically the only procedure for peaches, for they cannot be sprayed.\r\n\r\nThe quince curculio is somewhat larger than that infesting the plum and\r\ndiffers in its life-history. The grubs leave the fruits in the fall and\r\nenter the ground, where they hibernate and transform to adults the next\r\nMay, June, or July, depending on the season. When the adults appear,\r\njar them from the tree on sheets or curculio-catchers and destroy them.\r\nTo determine when they appear, jar a few trees daily, beginning the\r\nlatter part of May in New York.\r\n\r\n_Currant-worm._—In the spring the small green, black-spotted larvae\r\nfeed on the foliage of currants and gooseberries, beginning their work\r\non the lower leaves. A second brood occurs in early summer. When worms\r\nfirst appear, spray with 1 lb. Paris green or 4 lb. arsenate of lead in\r\n100 gal. of water. Ordinarily the poison should be combined with\r\nbordeaux (for leaf-spot).\r\n\r\n_Cut-worms._—Probably the remedy for cut-worms most often practiced in\r\ngardens, and which cannot fail to be effective when faithfully carried\r\nout, is hand-picking with lanterns at night or digging them out from\r\naround the base of the infested plants during the day. Bushels of\r\ncut-worms have been gathered in this way, and with profit. When from\r\nsome cause success does not attend the use of the poisoned baits, to be\r\ndiscussed next, hand-picking is the only other method yet recommended\r\nthat can be relied upon to check cut-worm depredations.\r\n\r\nThe best methods yet devised for killing cut-worms in any situation are\r\nthe poisoned baits, using Paris green or arsenate of lead for the\r\npurpose. Poisoned bunches of clover or weeds have been thoroughly\r\ntested, even by the wagon-load, over large areas, and nearly all have\r\nreported them very effective; lamb’s quarters (pigweed), pepper-grass,\r\nand mullein are among the weeds especially attractive to cutworms. On\r\nsmall areas the making of the baits is done by hand, but they have been\r\nprepared on a large scale by spraying the plants in the field, cutting\r\nthem with a scythe or machine, and pitching them from wagons in small\r\nbunches wherever desired. Distributed a few feet apart, between rows of\r\ngarden plants at nightfall, they have attracted and killed enough\r\ncut-worms often to save a large proportion of the crop; if the bunches\r\ncan be covered with a shingle, they will keep fresher much longer. The\r\nfresher the baits, and the more thoroughly the baiting is done, the\r\nmore cut-worms one can destroy. However, it may sometimes happen that a\r\nsufficient quantity of such green succulent plants cannot be obtained\r\nearly enough in the season in some localities. In this case, and we are\r\nnot sure but in all cases, the poisoned bran mash can be used to the\r\nbest advantage. It is easily made and applied at any time, is not\r\nexpensive, and thus far the results show that it is a very attractive\r\nand effective bait. A tablespoonful can be quickly dropped around the\r\nbase of each cabbage or tomato plant; small amounts may be easily\r\nscattered along the rows of onions and turnips, or a little dropped on\r\na hill of corn or cucumbers.\r\n\r\nThe best time to apply these poisoned baits is two or three days before\r\nany plants have come up or been set out in the garden. If the ground\r\nhas been properly prepared, the worms will have had but little to eat\r\nfor several days and they will thus seize the first opportunity to\r\nappease their hunger upon the baits, and wholesale destruction will\r\nresult. The baits should always be applied at this time wherever\r\ncut-worms are expected. But it is not too late usually to save most of\r\na crop after the pests have made their presence known by cutting off\r\nsome of the plants. Act promptly and use the baits freely.\r\n\r\nFor mechanical means of protecting from cut-worms, see pp. 186-7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 235. Elm-leaf beetle, adult, somewhat enlarged\r\n(after Howard).]\r\n\r\n_Elm-leaf beetle_.—Generally speaking one thorough and timely spraying\r\nis ample to control the elm-leaf beetle (Fig. 235). Use arsenate of\r\nlead, 1 lb. to 25 gal., and make the application to the under side of\r\nthe leaves the latter part of May or very early in June in New York.\r\nOccasionally, when the beetle is very abundant, due in all probability\r\nto no spraying in earlier years, it may be advisable to make a second\r\napplication, and the same may be true when conditions necessitate the\r\napplication earlier than when it will be most efficacious. This latter\r\ncondition is likely to obtain wherever a large number of trees must be\r\ntreated with inadequate outfit.\r\n\r\n_Oyster-shell scale_.—This is an elongate scale or bark-louse, 1/8 in.\r\nin length, resembling an oyster shell in shape and often incrusting the\r\nbark of apple twigs. It hibernates as minute white eggs under the old\r\nscales. The eggs hatch during the latter part of May or in June, the\r\ndate depending on the season. After they hatch, the young may be seen\r\nas tiny whitish lice crawling about on the bark. When these young\r\nappear, spray with kerosene emulsion, diluted with 6 parts of water, or\r\nwhale-oil or any good soap, 1 lb. in 4 or 5 gal. of water.\r\n\r\n_Pear insects_.—The psylla is one of the most serious insects affecting\r\nthe pear tree. It is a minute, yellowish, flat-bodied, sucking insect\r\noften found in the axils of the leaves and fruit early in the season.\r\nThey develop into minute cicada-like jumping-lice. The young psyllas\r\nsecrete a large quantity of honey-dew in which a peculiar black fungus\r\ngrows, giving the bark a characteristic sooty appearance. There may be\r\nfour broods annually and the trees are often seriously injured. After\r\nthe blossoms fall, spray with kerosene emulsion, diluted with 6 parts\r\nof water, or whale-oil soap, 1 lb. in 4 or 5 gal. of water. Repeat the\r\napplication at intervals of 3 to 7 days until the insects are under\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThe pear slug is a small, slimy, dark green larva which skeletonizes\r\nthe leaves in June, and a second brood appears in August. Spray\r\nthoroughly with 1 lb. Paris green, or 4 lb. arsenate of lead, in 100\r\ngal. of water.\r\n\r\n_Potato insects_.—The Colorado potato beetle, or potato-bug, emerges\r\nfrom hibernation in the spring and lays masses of orange eggs on the\r\nunder side of the leaves. The larvae are known as “slugs” and\r\n“soft-shells” and cause most of the injury to the vines. Spray with\r\nParis green, 2 lb. in 100 gal. of water, or arsenite of soda combined\r\nwith bordeaux mixture. It may sometimes be necessary to use a greater\r\nstrength of the poison, particularly on the older “slugs.”\r\n\r\nThe small black flea-beetles riddle the leaves with holes and cause the\r\nfoliage to die. Bordeaux mixture as applied for potato blight protects\r\nthe plants by making them repellent to the beetles.\r\n\r\n_Raspberry, blackberry, and dewberry insects_.—The greenish, spiny\r\nlarvae of the saw-fly feed on the tender leaves in spring. Spray with\r\nParis green or arsenate of lead, or apply hellebore.\r\n\r\nThe cane-borer is a grub that burrows down through the canes, causing\r\nthem to die. In laying her eggs, the adult beetle girdles the tip of\r\nthe cane with a ring of punctures, causing it to wither and droop. In\r\nmidsummer, cut off and destroy the drooping tips.\r\n\r\n_Red spider_.—Minute reddish mites on the under sides of leaves in\r\ngreenhouses and sometimes out of doors in dry weather. Syringe off the\r\nplants with clear water two or three times a week, taking care not to\r\ndrench the beds.\r\n\r\n_Rose insects_.—The green plant-lice usually work on the buds, and the\r\nyellow leaf-hoppers feed on the leaves. Spray, whenever necessary, with\r\nkerosene emulsion, diluted with 6 parts of water, or whale-oil or any\r\ngood soap, 1 lb. in 5 or 6 gal. of water.\r\n\r\nThe rose-chafer is often a most pernicious pest on roses, grapes, and\r\nother plants. The ungainly, long-legged, grayish beetles occur in sandy\r\nregions and often swarm into vineyards and destroy the blossoms and\r\nfoliage. Spray thoroughly with arsenate of lead, 10 lb. in 100 gal. of\r\nwater. Repeat the application if necessary. (See under Rose in Chap.\r\nVIII.)\r\n\r\n_San José scale_.—This pernicious scale is nearly circular in outline\r\nand about the size of a small pin head, with a raised center. When\r\nabundant, it forms a crust on the branches and causes small red spots\r\non the fruit. It multiplies with marvelous rapidity, there being three\r\nor four broods annually in New York, and each mother scale may give\r\nbirth to several hundred young. The young are born alive, and breeding\r\ncontinues until late autumn when all stages are killed by the cold\r\nweather except the tiny half-grown black scales, many of which\r\nhibernate safely. Spray thoroughly in the fall after the leaves drop,\r\nor early in the spring before growth begins, with lime-sulfur wash, or\r\nmiscible oil 1 gal. in 10 gal. of water. When badly infested, make two\r\napplications, one in the fall and another in the spring. In case of\r\nlarge old trees, 25 per cent crude oil emulsion should be applied just\r\nas the buds are swelling.\r\n\r\nIn nurseries, after the trees are dug, fumigate with hydrocyanic acid\r\ngas, using 1 oz. of potassium cyanide for every 100 cu. ft. of space.\r\nContinue the fumigation from one-half to three-quarters of an hour. Do\r\nnot fumigate the trees when they are wet, since the presence of\r\nmoisture renders them liable to injury.\r\n\r\n_Tent-caterpillar_.—The insect hibernates in the egg stage. The eggs\r\nare glued in ring-like brownish masses around the smaller twigs, where\r\nthey may be easily found and destroyed. The caterpillars appear in\r\nearly spring, devour the tender leaves, and build unsightly nests on\r\nthe smaller branches. This pest is usually controlled by the treatment\r\nrecommended for the codlin-moth. Destroy the nests by burning or by\r\nwiping out when small. Often a bad pest on apple trees.\r\n\r\n_Violet gall-fly._—Violets grown under glass are often greatly injured\r\nby a very small maggot, which causes the edges of the leaves to curl,\r\nturn yellowish, and die. The adult is a very minute fly resembling a\r\nmosquito. Pick off and destroy infested leaves as soon as discovered.\r\nFumigation is not advised for this insect or for red-spider.\r\n\r\n_White-fly._—The minute white-flies are common on greenhouse plants and\r\noften in summer on plants about gardens near greenhouses. The nymphs\r\nare small greenish, scale-like insects found on the under side of the\r\nleaves; the adults are minute, white, mealy-winged flies. Spray with\r\nkerosene emulsion or whale-oil soap; or if infesting cucumbers or\r\ntomatoes, fumigate over night with hydrocyanic acid gas, using 1 oz. of\r\npotassium cyanide to each 1000 cu. ft. of space. (See page 188.)\r\n\r\n_White grubs_.—The large curved white grubs that are so troublesome in\r\nlawns and strawberry fields are the larvae of the common June beetles.\r\nThey live in the ground, feeding on the roots of grasses and weeds. Dig\r\nout grubs from beneath infested plants. Thorough early fall cultivation\r\nof land intended for strawberries will destroy many of the pupae. In\r\nlawns, remove the sod, destroy the grubs, and make new sward, when the\r\ninfestation is bad.\r\n\r\n_Treatment for some of the common plant diseases_.\r\n\r\nThe following advice (mostly adapted from Whetzel and Stewart) covers\r\nthe most frequent types of fungous disease appearing to the home\r\ngardener. Many other kinds, however, will almost certainly attract his\r\nattention the first season if he looks closely. The standard remedy is\r\nbordeaux mixture; but because this material discolors the foliage the\r\ncarbonate of copper is sometimes used instead. The treatments here\r\nrecommended are for New York; but it should not be difficult to apply\r\nthe dates elsewhere. The gardener must supplement all advice of this\r\ncharacter with his own judgment and experience, and take his own risks.\r\n\r\n_Apple scab_.—Usually most evident on the fruit, forming blotches and\r\nscabs. Spray with bordeaux, 5-5-50 or 3-3-50; first, just before the\r\nblossoms open; second, just as the blossoms fall; third, 10 to 14 days\r\nafter the blossoms fall. The second spraying seems to be the most\r\nimportant. Always apply _before_ rains, not _after_.\r\n\r\n_Asparagus rust_.—The most common and destructive disease of asparagus,\r\nproducing reddish or black pustules on the stems and branches. Late in\r\nthe fall, burn all affected plants. Fertilize liberally and cultivate\r\nthoroughly. During the cutting season, permit no plants to mature and\r\ncut all wild asparagus plants in vicinity once a week. Rust may be\r\npartially controlled by spraying with bordeaux, 5-5-50, containing a\r\nsticker of resin-sal-soda soap, but it is a difficult and expensive\r\noperation and probably not profitable except on large acreage. Begin\r\nspraying after cutting as soon as new shoots are 8 to 10 in. high and\r\nrepeat once or twice a week until about September 15. Dusting with\r\nsulfur has proved effective in California.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage and cauliflower diseases_.—Black-rot is a bacterial disease;\r\nthe plants drop their leaves and fail to head. Practice crop rotation;\r\nsoak seed 15 min. in a solution made by dissolving one corrosive\r\nsublimate tablet in a pint of water. Tablets may be bought at drug\r\nstores.\r\n\r\nClub-root or club-foot is a well-known disease. The parasite lives in\r\nthe soil. Practice crop rotation. Set only healthy plants. Do not use\r\nmanure containing cabbage refuse. If necessary to use infested land,\r\napply good stone lime, 2 to 5 tons per acre. Apply at least as early as\r\nthe autumn before planting; two to four years is better. Lime the\r\nseed-bed in same way.\r\n\r\n_Carnation rust_.—This disease may be recognized by the brown, powdery\r\npustules on the stem and leaves. Plant only the varieties least\r\naffected by it. Take cuttings only from healthy plants. Spray (in the\r\nfield, once a week; in the greenhouse, once in two weeks) with copper\r\nsulfate, 1 lb. to 20 gal. of water. Keep the greenhouse air as dry and\r\ncool as is compatible with good growth. Keep the foliage free from\r\nmoisture. Train the plants so as to secure a free circulation of air\r\namong them.\r\n\r\n_Chestnut_.—The bark disease of chestnut has become very serious in\r\nsoutheastern New York, causing the bark to sink and die and killing the\r\ntree. Cutting out the diseased places and treating aseptically may be\r\nuseful in light cases, but badly infected trees are incurable, in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge. Inspection of nursery stock and burning\r\nof affected trees is the only procedure now to be recommended. The\r\ndisease is reported in New England and western New York.\r\n\r\n_Chrysanthemum leaf-spot._—Spray with bordeaux, 5-5-50, every ten days\r\nor often enough to protect new foliage. Ammoniacal copper carbonate may\r\nbe used, but it is not so effective.\r\n\r\n_Cucumber diseases_.—“Wilt” is a disease caused by bacteria that are\r\ndistributed chiefly by striped cucumber beetles. Destroy the beetles or\r\ndrive them away by thorough spraying with bordeaux, 5-5-50. Gather and\r\ndestroy all wilted leaves and plants. The most that can be expected is\r\nthat the loss may be slightly reduced.\r\n\r\nDowny mildew is a serious fungous disease of the cucumber known among\r\ngrowers as “the blight.” The leaves become mottled with yellow, show\r\ndead spots, and then dry up. Spray with bordeaux, 5-5-50. Begin\r\nspraying when the plants begin to run, and repeat every 10 to 14 days\r\nthroughout the season.\r\n\r\n_Currant diseases_.—Leaf-spots and anthracnose are caused by two or\r\nthree different fungi. The leaves become spotted, turn yellow, and fall\r\nprematurely. They may be controlled by three to five sprayings with\r\nbordeaux, 5-5-50, but it is doubtful whether the diseases are\r\nsufficiently destructive on the average to warrant so much expense.\r\n\r\n_Gooseberry powdery mildew_.—The fruit and leaves are covered with a\r\ndirty white growth of fungus. In setting a new plantation, choose a\r\nsite where the land is well underdrained and where there is a good\r\ncirculation of air. Cut away drooping branches. Keep the ground\r\nunderneath free from weeds. Spray with potassium sulfide, 1 oz. to 2\r\ngal.; begin when the buds are breaking and repeat every 7 to 10 days\r\nuntil the fruit is gathered. Powdery mildew is very destructive to the\r\nEuropean varieties.\r\n\r\n_Grape black-rot._—Remove all “mummies” that cling to the arms at\r\ntrimming time. Plow early, turning under all old mummies and diseased\r\nleaves. Rake all refuse under the vine into the last furrow and cover\r\nwith the grape hoe. This cannot be too thoroughly done. The disease is\r\nfavored by wet weather and weeds or grass in the vineyard. Use surface\r\ncultivation and keep down all weeds and grass. Keep the vines well\r\nsprouted; if necessary sprout twice. Spray with bordeaux mixture,\r\n5-5-50, until the middle of July, after that with ammoniacal copper\r\ncarbonate. The number of sprayings will vary with the season. Make the\r\nfirst application when the third leaf shows. Infections take place with\r\neach rain, and occur throughout the growing season. The foliage should\r\nbe protected by a coating of the spray before every rain. The new\r\ngrowth especially should be well sprayed.\r\n\r\n_Hollyhock rust_.—Fig. 212. Eradicate the wild mallow _(Malva\r\nrotundifolia)._ Remove all hollyhock leaves as soon as they show signs\r\nof rust. Spray several times with bordeaux mixture, taking care to\r\ncover both sides of leaves.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce drop or rot_.—This is a fungous disease often destructive in\r\ngreenhouses, discovered by the sudden wilting of the plants. It is\r\ncompletely controlled by steam sterilization of the soil to the depth\r\nof two inches or more. If it is not feasible to sterilize the soil, use\r\nfresh soil for every crop of lettuce.\r\n\r\n_Muskmelon diseases_.—“Blight” is a very troublesome disease. The\r\nleaves show angular dead-brown spots, then dry up and die; the fruit\r\noften fails to ripen and lacks flavor. It is caused by the same fungus\r\nas is the downy mildew of cucumbers. While bordeaux has proved\r\neffective in controlling the downy mildew on cucumbers, it seems to be\r\nof little value in lessening the same disease on melons.\r\n\r\n“Wilt” is the same as the wilt of cucumbers; same treatment is given.\r\n\r\n_Peach diseases_.—Brown-rot is difficult to control. Plant resistant\r\nvarieties. Prune the trees so as to let in sunlight and air. Thin the\r\nfruit well. As often as possible pick and destroy all rotten fruits. In\r\nthe fall destroy all remaining fruits. Spray with bordeaux mixture\r\nbefore the buds break, or self-boiled lime-sulfur.\r\n\r\nLeaf-curl is a disease in which the leaves become swollen and distorted\r\nin spring and drop during June and July (Fig. 213). Elberta is an\r\nespecially susceptible variety. Easily and completely controlled by\r\nspraying the trees once, before the buds swell, with bordeaux, 5-5-50,\r\nor with the lime-sulfur mixtures used for San José scale.\r\n\r\nBlack-spot or scab often proves troublesome in wet seasons and\r\nparticularly in damp or sheltered situations. While this disease\r\nattacks the twigs and leaves, it is most conspicuous and injurious on\r\nthe fruit, where it appears as dark spots or blotches. In severe\r\nattacks the fruit cracks. In the treatment of this disease it is of\r\nprime importance _to secure a free circulation of air_ about the fruit.\r\nAccomplish this by avoiding low sites, by pruning, and by removal of\r\nwindbreaks. Spray as for leaf-curl and follow with two applications of\r\npotassium sulfide, 1 oz. to 3 gal., the first being made soon after the\r\nfruit is set and the second when the fruit is half grown.\r\n\r\nYellows is a so-called “physiological disease.” Cause unknown.\r\nContagious, and serious in some localities. Known by the premature\r\nripening of the fruit, by red streaks and spots in the flesh, and by\r\nthe peculiar clusters of sickly, yellowish shoots that appear on the\r\nlimbs here and there (Fig. 215). Dig out and burn diseased trees as\r\nsoon as discovered.\r\n\r\n_Pear diseases_.—Fire-blight kills the twigs and branches, on which the\r\nleaves suddenly blacken and die but do not fall. It also produces\r\ncankers on the trunk and large limbs. Prune out blighted branches as\r\nsoon as discovered, cutting 6 to 8 in. below the lowest evidences of\r\nthe disease. Clean out limb and body cankers. Disinfect all large\r\nwounds with corrosive sublimate solution, 1 to 1000, and cover with\r\ncoat of paint. Avoid forcing a rapid, succulent growth. Plant the\r\nvarieties least affected.\r\n\r\nPear scab is very similar to apple scab. It is very destructive to some\r\nvarieties, as, for example, Flemish Beauty and Seckel. Spray three\r\ntimes with bordeaux, as for apple scab.\r\n\r\n_Plum and cherry diseases_.—Black-knot is a fungus, the spores of which\r\nare carried from tree to tree by the wind and thus spread the\r\ninfection. Cut out and burn all knots as soon as discovered. See that\r\nthe knots are removed from all plum and cherry trees in the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nLeaf-spot is a disease in which the leaves become covered with reddish\r\nor brown spots and fall prematurely (Fig. 211); badly affected trees\r\nwinterkill. Often, the dead spots drop out, leaving clear-cut holes.\r\nSpray with bordeaux, 5-5-50. For cherries, make four applications:\r\nfirst, just before blossoms open; second, when fruit is free from\r\ncalyx; third, two weeks later; fourth, two weeks after third. In plums\r\nit may be controlled by two or three applications of bordeaux, 5-5-50.\r\nMake the first one about ten days after the blossoms fall and the\r\nothers at intervals of about three weeks. This applies to European\r\nvarieties. Japan plums should not be sprayed with bordeaux.\r\n\r\n_Potato diseases_.—There are different kinds of potato blight and rot.\r\nThe most important are early blight and late blight—both fungous\r\ndiseases. Early blight affects only the foliage. Late blight kills the\r\nfoliage and often rots the tubers. Two serious troubles often mistaken\r\nfor blight are: (1) Tip burn, the browning of the tips and margins of\r\nthe leaves due to dry weather; and (2) flea-beetle injury, in which the\r\nleaves show numerous small holes and then dry up. The loss from blight\r\nand flea-beetles is enormous—often, one-fourth to one-half the crop.\r\nFor blight-rot and flea-beetles spray with bordeaux, 5-5-50. Begin when\r\nthe plants are 6 to 8 in. high and repeat every 10 to 14 days during\r\nthe season, making 5 to 7 applications in all. Use 40 to 100 gal. per\r\nacre at each application. Under conditions exceptionally favorable to\r\nblight it will pay to spray as often as once a week.\r\n\r\nScab is caused by a fungus that attacks the surface of the tubers. It\r\nis carried over on diseased tubers and in the soil. In general, when\r\nland becomes badly infested with scab, it is best to plant it with\r\nother crops for several years. (See page 190.)\r\n\r\n_Raspberry diseases_.—Anthracnose is very destructive to black\r\nraspberries, but not often injurious to the red varieties. It is\r\ndetected by the circular or elliptical gray scab-like spots on the\r\ncanes. Avoid taking young plants from diseased plantations. Remove all\r\nold canes and badly diseased new ones as soon as the fruit is gathered.\r\nAlthough spraying with bordeaux, 5-5-50, will control the malady, the\r\ntreatment may not be profitable. If spraying seems advisable, make the\r\nfirst application when the new canes are 6 to 8 in. high and follow\r\nwith two more at intervals of 10 to 14 days.\r\n\r\nCane-blight or wilt is a destructive disease affecting both red and\r\nblack varieties. Fruiting canes suddenly wilt and die. It is caused by\r\na fungus which attacks the cane at some point and kills the bark and\r\nwood, thereby causing the parts above to die. No successful treatment\r\nis known. In making new settings, use only plants from healthy\r\nplantations. Remove the fruiting canes as soon as the fruit is\r\ngathered.\r\n\r\nRed-rust is often serious on black varieties, but does not affect red\r\nones. It is the same as red rust of blackberry. Dig up and destroy\r\naffected plants.\r\n\r\n_Rose diseases_.—Black leaf-spot is one of the commonest diseases of\r\nthe rose. It causes the leaves to fall prematurely. Spray with\r\nbordeaux, 5-5-50, beginning as soon as the first spots appear on the\r\nleaves. Two or three applications at intervals of ten days will very\r\nlargely control the disease. Ammoniacal copper carbonate may be used on\r\nroses grown under glass. Apply once a week until disease is under\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nFor mildew on greenhouse roses, keep the steam pipes painted with a\r\npaste made of equal parts lime and sulfur mixed up with water. The\r\nmildew is a surface-feeding fungus and is killed by the fumes of the\r\nsulfur. Outdoor roses that become infested with the mildew may be\r\ndusted with sulfur, or sprayed with a solution of potassium sulfide, 1\r\noz. to 3 gal. water. Spray or dust with the sulfur two or three times\r\nat intervals of a week or ten days.\r\n\r\n_Strawberry leaf-spot._—The most common and serious fungous disease of\r\nthe strawberry; also called rust and leaf-blight. The leaves show spots\r\nwhich at first are of a deep purple color, but later enlarge and the\r\ncenter becomes gray or nearly white. The fungus passes the winter in\r\nthe old diseased leaves that fall to the ground. In setting new\r\nplantations, remove all diseased leaves from the plants before they are\r\ntaken to the field. Soon after growth begins, spray the newly set\r\nplants with bordeaux, 5-5-50. Make three or four additional sprayings\r\nduring the season. The following spring, spray just before blossoming\r\nand again 10 to 14 days later. If the bed is to be fruited a second\r\ntime, mow the plants and burn over the beds as soon as the fruit is\r\ngathered. Plant resistant varieties.\r\n\r\n_Tomato leaf-spot._—The distinguishing character of this disease is\r\nthat it begins on the lower leaves and works towards the top, killing\r\nthe foliage as it goes. It is controlled with difficulty because it is\r\ncarried over winter in the diseased leaves and tops that fall to the\r\nground. When setting out plants, pinch off all the lower leaves that\r\ntouch the ground; also any leaves that show suspicious-looking\r\ndead-spots. The trouble often starts in the seed-bed. Spray plants very\r\nthoroughly with bordeaux, 5-5-50, beginning as soon as the plants are\r\nset out. Stake and tie up for greater convenience in spraying. Spray\r\nunder side of the leaves. Spray every week or ten days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nTHE GROWING OF THE ORNAMENTAL PLANTS—THE CLASSES OF PLANTS, AND LISTS\r\n\r\nIn choosing the kinds of plants for the main grounds the gardener\r\nshould carefully distinguish two categories,—those plants to compose\r\nthe structural masses and design of the place, and those that are to be\r\nused for mere ornament. The chief merits to be sought in the former are\r\ngood foliage, pleasing form and habit, shades of green, and color of\r\nwinter twigs. The merits of the latter lie chiefly in flowers or\r\ncolored foliage.\r\n\r\nEach of these categories should be again divided. Of plants for the\r\nmain design, there might be discussion of trees for a windbreak, of\r\ntrees for shade; of shrubs for screens or heavy plantings, for the\r\nlighter side plantings, and for incidental masses about the buildings\r\nor on the lawn; and perhaps also of vines for porches and arbors, of\r\nevergreens, of hedges, and of the heavier herbaceous masses.\r\n\r\nPlants used for mere embellishment or ornamentation may be ranged again\r\ninto categories for permanent herbaceous borders, for display beds,\r\nribbon edgings, annuals for temporary effects, foliage beds, plants for\r\nadding color and emphasis to the shrubbery masses, plants desired to be\r\ngrown as single specimens or as curiosities, and plants for porch-boxes\r\nand window-gardens.\r\n\r\nHaving now briefly suggested the uses of the plants, we shall proceed\r\nto discuss them in reference to the making of home grounds. This\r\nchapter contains a brief consideration of:\r\n\r\n_Planting for immediate effect,_\r\n\r\n_The use of “foliage” trees and shrubs,_\r\n\r\n_Windbreaks and screens,_\r\n\r\n_The making of hedges,_\r\n\r\n_The borders,_\r\n\r\n_The flower-beds,_\r\n\r\n_Aquatic and bog plants,_\r\n\r\n_Rockeries and alpine plants;_\r\n\r\n\r\nand then it runs into nine sub-chapters, as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. Plants for carpet-beds, p. 234;\r\n\r\n2. The annual plants, p. 241;\r\n\r\n3. Hardy herbaceous perennials, p. 260;\r\n\r\n4. Bulbs and tubers, p. 281;\r\n\r\n5. The shrubbery, p. 290;\r\n\r\n6. Climbing plants, p. 307;\r\n\r\n7. Trees for lawns and streets, p. 319;\r\n\r\n8. Coniferous evergreen trees and shrubs, p. 331;\r\n\r\n9. Window-gardens, p. 336.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in Chapter VIII, the particular cultures of plants needing\r\nspecial care are briefly discussed.\r\n\r\n_Planting for immediate effect_.\r\n\r\nIt is always legitimate, and, in fact, desirable, to plant for\r\nimmediate effect. One may plant very thickly of rapid-growing trees and\r\nshrubs for this purpose. It is a fact, however, that very rapid-growing\r\ntrees usually lack strong or artistic character. Other and better trees\r\nshould be planted with them and the featureless kinds be gradually\r\nremoved. (Page 41.)\r\n\r\nThe effect of a new place may be greatly heightened by a dexterous use\r\nof annuals and other herbaceous stuff in the shrub plantations. Until\r\nthe shrubbery covers the ground, temporary plants may be grown among\r\nthem. Subtropical beds may give a very desirable temporary finish to\r\nplaces that are pretentious enough to make them seem in keeping.\r\n\r\nVery rough, hard, sterile, and stony banks may sometimes be covered\r\nwith coltsfoot (_Tussilago Farfara_), sacaline, _Rubus cratœgifotius,_\r\ncomfrey, and various wild growths that persist in similar places in the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nHowever much the planter may plan for immediate effects, the beauty of\r\ntrees and shrubs comes with maturity and age, and this beauty is often\r\ndelayed, or even obliterated, by shearing and excessive heading-back.\r\nAt first, bushes are stiff and erect, but when they attain their full\r\ncharacter, they usually droop or roll over to meet the sward. Some\r\nbushes make mounds of green much sooner than others that may even be\r\nclosely related. Thus the common yellow-bell (_Forsythia virdissima_)\r\nremains stiff and hard for some years, whereas _F. suspensa_ makes a\r\nrolling heap of green in two or three years. Quick informal effects can\r\nalso be secured by the use of Hall’s Japanese honeysuckle (_Lonicera\r\nHalliana_ of nurserymen), an evergreen in the South, and holding its\r\nleaves until midwinter or later in the North. It may be used for\r\ncovering a rock, a pile of rubbish, a stump (Fig. 236), to fill a\r\ncorner against a foundation, or it may be trained on a porch or arbor.\r\nThere is a form with yellow-veined leaves. _Rosa Wichuraiana_ and some\r\nof the dewberries are useful for covering rough places.\r\n\r\nMany vines that are commonly used for porches and arbors may be\r\nemployed also for the borders of shrub-plantations and for covering\r\nrough banks and rocks, quickly giving a finish to the cruder parts of\r\nthe place. Such vines, among others, are various kinds of clematis,\r\nVirginia creeper, actinidia, akebia, trumpet creeper, periploca,\r\nbitter-sweet (_Solanum Dulcamara_), wax-work (_Celastrus scandens_).\r\n\r\nOf course, very good immediate effects may be secured by very close\r\nplanting (page 222), but the homesteader must not neglect to thin out\r\nthese plantations when the time comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 236. Stump covered with Japanese honeysuckle.]\r\n\r\n_The use of “foliage” trees and shrubs_.\r\n\r\nThere is always a temptation to use too freely of the trees and shrubs\r\nthat are characterized by abnormal or striking foliage. The subject is\r\ndiscussed in its artistic bearings on pages 40 and 41.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the yellow-leaved, spotted-leaved, variegated, and other\r\nabnormal “foliage” plants are less hardy and less reliable than the\r\ngreen-leaved or “natural” forms. They usually require more care, if\r\nthey are kept in vigorous and seemly condition. Some marked exceptions\r\nto this are noted in the lists of trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\nThere are some plants of striking foliage, however, that are perfectly\r\nreliable, but they are usually not of the “horticultural variety”\r\nclass, their characteristics being normal to the species. Some of the\r\nsilver or white-leaved poplars, for example, produce the most striking\r\ncontrasts of foliage, particularly if set near darker trees, and for\r\nthis reason they are much desired by many planters. Bolle’s poplar\r\n(_Populus Bolleana_ of the nurseries) is one of the best of these\r\ntrees. Its habit is something like that of the Lombardy. The upper\r\nsurface of the deeply lobed leaves is dark dull green, while the under\r\nsurface is almost snowy white. Such emphatic trees as this should\r\ngenerally be partially obscured by planting them amongst other trees,\r\nso that they appear to mix with the other foliage; or else they should\r\nbe seen at some distance. Other varieties of the common white poplar or\r\nabele are occasionally useful, although most of them sprout badly and\r\nmay become a nuisance. But the planting of these immodest trees is so\r\nlikely to be overdone that one scarcely dare recommend them, although,\r\nwhen skillfully used, they may be made to produce most excellent\r\neffects. If any reader has a particular fondness for trees of this\r\nclass (or any others with woolly-white foliage) and if he has only an\r\nordinary city lot or farm-yard to ornament, let him reduce his desires\r\nto a single tree, and then if that tree is planted in the interior of a\r\ngroup of other trees, no harm can result.\r\n\r\n_Windbreaks and screens_.\r\n\r\nA shelter-belt for the home grounds is often placed at the extreme edge\r\nof the home yard, toward the heaviest or prevailing wind. It may be a\r\ndense plantation of evergreens. If so, the Norway spruce is one of the\r\nbest for general purposes in the northeastern states. For a lower belt\r\nthe arbor vitae is excellent. Some of the pines, as the Scotch or\r\nAustrian, and the native white pine, are also to be advised,\r\nparticularly if the belt is at some distance from the residence. As a\r\nrule, the coarser the tree the farther it should be placed from the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe common deciduous trees of the region (as elm, maple, box-elder) may\r\nbe planted in a row or rows for windbreaks. Good temporary shelter\r\nbelts are secured by poplars and large willows. On the prairies and far\r\nnorth the laurel willow _(Salix laurifolia_ of the trade) is excellent.\r\nWhere snow blows very badly, two lines of breaks may be planted three\r\nto six rods apart, so that the inclosed lane may catch the drift; this\r\nmethod is employed in prairie regions.\r\n\r\nPersons may desire to use the break as a screen to hide undesirable\r\nobjects. If these objects are of a permanent character, as a barn or an\r\nunkempt property, evergreen trees should be used. For temporary\r\nscreens, any of the very large-growing herbaceous plants may be\r\nemployed. Very excellent subjects are sunflowers, the large-growing\r\nnicotianas, castor beans, large varieties of Indian corn, and plants of\r\nlike growth. Excellent screens are sometimes made with vines on a\r\ntrellis.\r\n\r\nVery efficient summer screens may be made with ailanthus, paulownia,\r\nbasswood, sumac, and other plants that tend to throw up very vigorous\r\nshoots from the base. After these plants have been set a year or two,\r\nthey are cut back nearly to the ground in winter or spring, and strong\r\nshoots are thrown up with great luxuriance during the summer, giving a\r\ndense screen and presenting a semi-tropical effect. For such purposes,\r\nthe roots should be planted only two or three feet apart. If, after a\r\ntime, the roots become so crowded that the shoots are weak, some of the\r\nplants may be removed. Top-dressing the area every fall with manure\r\nwill tend to make the ground rich enough to afford a very heavy summer\r\ngrowth. (See Fig. 50.)\r\n\r\n_The making of hedges_.\r\n\r\nHedges are much less used in this country than in Europe, and for\r\nseveral reasons. Our climate is dry, and most hedges do not thrive so\r\nwell here as there; labor is high-priced, and the trimming is therefore\r\nlikely to be neglected; our farms are so large that much fencing is\r\nrequired; timber and wire are cheaper than live hedges.\r\n\r\nHowever, hedges are used with good effect about the home grounds. In\r\norder to secure a good ornamental hedge, it is necessary to have a\r\nthoroughly well-prepared deep soil, to set the plants close, and to\r\nshear them at least twice every year. For evergreen hedges the most\r\nserviceable plant in general is the arbor vitae. The plants may be set\r\nat distances of 1 to 2-1/2 feet apart. For coarser hedges, the Norway\r\nspruce is used; and for still coarser ones, the Scotch and Austrian\r\npines. In California the staple conifer hedge is made of Monterey\r\ncypress. For choice evergreen hedges about the grounds, particularly\r\noutside the northern states, some of the retinosporas are very useful.\r\nOne of the most satisfactory of all coniferous plants for hedges is the\r\ncommon hemlock, which stands shearing well and makes a very soft and\r\npleasing mass. The plants may be set from 2 to 4 feet apart.\r\n\r\nOther plants that hold their leaves and are good for hedges are the\r\ncommon box and the privets. Box hedges are the best for very low\r\nborders about walks and flower-beds. The dwarf variety can be kept down\r\nto a height of 6 inches to a foot for any number of years. The\r\nlarger-growing varieties make excellent hedges 3, 4, and 5 feet high.\r\nThe ordinary privet or prim holds its leaves well into winter in the\r\nNorth. The so-called Californian privet holds its leaves rather longer\r\nand stands better along the seashore. The mahonia makes a low, loose\r\nhedge or edging in locations where it will thrive. Pyracantha is also\r\nto be recommended where hardy. In the southern states, nothing is\r\nbetter than _Citrus trifoliata_. This is hardy even farther north than\r\nWashington in very favored localities. In the South, _Prunus\r\nCaroliniana_ is also used for hedges. Saltbush hedges are frequent in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nFor hedges of deciduous plants, the most common species are the\r\nbuckthorn, Japan quince, the European hawthorn and other thorns,\r\ntamarix, osage orange, honey locust, and various kinds of roses. Osage\r\norange has been the most used for farm hedges. For home grounds,\r\n_Berberis Thunbergii_ makes an excellent free hedge; also _Spiræa\r\nThunbergii_ and other spireas. The common _Rosa rugosa_ makes an\r\nattractive free hedge.\r\n\r\nHedges should be trimmed the year after they are set, although they\r\nshould not be sheared very closely until they reach the desired or\r\npermanent height. Thereafter they should be cut into the desired form\r\nin spring or fall, or both. If the plants are allowed to grow for a\r\nyear or two without trimming, they lose their lower leaves and become\r\nopen and straggly. Osage orange and some other plants are plashed; that\r\nis, the plants are set at an angle rather than perpendicularly, and\r\nthey are wired together obliquely in such a way that they make an\r\nimpenetrable barrier just above the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nFor closely clipped or sheared hedges, the best plants are arbor vitae,\r\nretinospora, hemlock, Norway spruce, privet, buckthorn, box, osage\r\norange, pyracantha, _Citrus trifoliata_. The pyracantha _(Pyracantha\r\ncoccinea_) is an evergreen shrub allied to cratægus, of which it is\r\nsometimes considered to be a species. It is also sometimes referred to\r\ncotoneaster. Although hardy in protected places in the North, it is\r\nessentially a bush of the middle and southern latitudes, and of\r\nCalifornia. It has persistent foliage and red berries. Var. _Lalandi_\r\nhas orange-red berries.\r\n\r\n_The borders_.\r\n\r\nThe word “border” is used to designate the heavy or continuous planting\r\nabout the boundaries of a place, or along the walks and drives, or\r\nagainst the buildings, in distinction from planting on the lawn or in\r\nthe interior spaces. A border receives different designations,\r\ndepending on the kinds of plants that are grown therein: it may be a\r\nshrub-border, a flower-border, a hardy border for native and other\r\nplants, a vine-border, and the like.\r\n\r\nThere are three rules for the choosing of plants for a hardy border:\r\nchoose (1) those that you like best, (2) those that are adapted to the\r\nclimate and soil, (3) those that are in place or in keeping with that\r\npart of the grounds.\r\n\r\nThe earth for the border should be fertile. The whole ground should be\r\nplowed or spaded and the plants set irregularly in the space; or the\r\nback row may be set in a line. If the border is composed of shrubs, and\r\nis large, a horse cultivator may be run in and out between the plants\r\nfor the first two or three years, since the shrubs will be set 2 to 4\r\nfeet apart. Ordinarily, however, the tilling is done with hand tools.\r\nAfter the plants are once established and the border is filled, it is\r\nbest to dig up as little as possible, for the digging disturbs the\r\nroots and breaks the crowns. It is usually best to pull out the weeds\r\nand give the border a top-dressing each fall of well-rotted manure. If\r\nthe ground is not very rich, an application of ashes or some commercial\r\nfertilizer may be given from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe border should be planted so thick as to allow the plants to run\r\ntogether, thereby giving one continuous effect. Most shrubs should be\r\nset 3 feet apart. Things as large as lilacs may go 4 feet and sometimes\r\neven more. Common herbaceous perennials, as bleeding heart,\r\ndelphiniums, hollyhocks, and the like, should go from 12 to 18 inches.\r\nOn the front edge of the border is a very excellent place for annual\r\nand tender flowering plants. Here, for example, one may make a fringe\r\nof asters, geraniums, coleus, or anything else he may choose. (Chap.\r\nII.)\r\n\r\nInto the heavy borders about the boundaries of the place the autumn\r\nleaves will drift and afford an excellent mulch. If these borders are\r\nplanted with shrubs, the leaves may be left there to decay, and not be\r\nraked off in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe general outline of the border facing the lawn should be more or\r\nless wavy or irregular, particularly if it is on the boundary of the\r\nplace. Alongside a walk or drive the margins may follow the general\r\ndirections of the walk or drive.\r\n\r\nIn making borders of perennial flowers the most satisfactory results\r\nare secured if a large clump of each kind or variety is grown. The\r\nherbaceous border is one of the most flexible parts of grounds, since\r\nit has no regular or formal design. Allow ample space for each\r\nperennial root,—often as much as three or four square feet,—and then if\r\nthe space is not filled the first year or two, scatter over the area\r\nseeds of poppies, sweet peas, asters, gilias, alyssum, or other\r\nannuals. Figures 237-239, from Long (“Popular Gardening,” i., 17, 18),\r\nsuggest methods of making such borders. They are on a scale of ten feet\r\nto the inch. The entire surface is tilled, and the irregular diagrams\r\ndesignate the sizes of the clumps. The diagrams containing no names are\r\nto be filled with bulbs, annuals, and tender plants, if desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 237. Suggestions for a border of spring flowers.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 238. A border of summer-flowering herbs.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that one cannot have a border unless\r\nhe has wide marginal spaces about his grounds. It is surprising how\r\nmany things one can grow in an old fence. Perennials that grow in\r\nfence-rows in fields ought also to grow in similar boundaries on the\r\nhome grounds. Some of garden annuals will thrive alongside a fence,\r\nparticularly if the fence does not shut off too much light; and many\r\nvines (both perennial and annual) will cover it effectively. Among\r\nannuals, the large-seeded, quick-germinating, rapid-growing kinds will\r\ndo best. Sunflower, sweet pea, morning glory, Japanese hop, zinnia,\r\nmarigold, amaranths, four o’clock, are some of the kinds that will hold\r\ntheir own. If the effort is made to grow plants in such places, it is\r\nimportant to give them all the advantage possible early in the season,\r\nso that they will get well ahead of the grass and weeds. Spade up the\r\nground all you can. Add a little quick-acting fertilizer. It is best to\r\nstart the plants in pots or small boxes, so that they will be in\r\nadvance of the weeds when they are set out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 239. An autumn-flowering border.]\r\n\r\n_The flower-beds._\r\n\r\nWe must remember to distinguish two uses of flowers,—their part in a\r\nlandscape design or picture, and their part in a bed or separate garden\r\nfor bloom. We now consider the flower-bed proper; and we include in the\r\nflower-bed such “foliage” plants as coleus, celosia, croton, and canna,\r\nalthough the main object of the flower-bed is to produce an abundance\r\nof flowers.\r\n\r\nIn making a flower-bed, see that the ground is well drained; that the\r\nsubsoil is deep; that the land is in a mellow and friable condition,\r\nand that it is fertile. Each fall it may have a mulch of rotted manure\r\nor of leafmold, which may be spaded under deeply in the spring; or the\r\nland may be spaded and left rough in the fall, which is a good practice\r\nwhen the soil has much clay. Make the flower-beds as broad as possible,\r\nso that the roots of the grass running in from either side will not\r\nmeet beneath the flowers and rob the beds of food and moisture. It is\r\nwell to add a little commercial fertilizer each fall or spring.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is well to emphasize making the ground fertile, it must be\r\nremembered (as indicated at the close of Chap. IV) that it can easily\r\nbe made too rich for such plants as we desire to keep within certain\r\nstature and for those from which we wish an abundance of bloom in a\r\nshort season. In over-rich ground, nasturtiums and some other plants\r\nnot only “run to vine,” but the bloom lacks brilliancy. When it is the\r\nleaf and vegetation that is wanted, there is little danger of making\r\nthe ground too rich, although it is possible to make the plant so\r\nsucculent and sappy that it becomes sprawly or breaks down; and other\r\nplants may be crippled and crowded out.\r\n\r\nThere are various styles of flower-planting. The mixed border, planted\r\nwith various hardy plants, and extending along either side of the\r\ngarden-walk, was popular years ago; and, with modifications in\r\nposition, form, and extent, has been a popular attachment to home\r\ngrounds during the past few years. To produce the best effects the\r\nplants should be set close enough to cover the ground; and the\r\nselection should be such as to afford a continuity of bloom.\r\n\r\nThe mixed flower-bed may contain only tender summer-blooming plants, in\r\nwhich case the bed, made up mostly of annuals, does not purport to\r\nexpress the entire season.\r\n\r\nIn distinction from the mixed or non-homogeneous flowerbed are the\r\nvarious forms of “bedding,” in which plants are massed for the purpose\r\nof making a connected and homogeneous bold display of form or color.\r\nThe bedding may be for the purpose of producing a strong effect of\r\nwhite, of blue, or of red; or of ribbon-like lines and edgings; or of\r\nluxurious and tropical expression; or to display boldly the features of\r\na particular plant, as the tulip, the hyacinth, the chrysanthemum.\r\n\r\nIn ribbon-bedding, flowering or foliage plants are arranged in\r\nribbon-like lines of harmoniously contrasting colors, commonly\r\naccompanying walks or drives, but also suitable for marking limits, or\r\nfor the side borders. In such beds, as well as the others, the tallest\r\nplants will be placed at the back, if the bed is to be seen from one\r\nside only, and the lowest at the front. If it is to be seen from both\r\nsides, then the tallest will stand in the center.\r\n\r\nA modification of the ribbon-line, bringing the contrasting colors\r\ntogether into masses forming circles or other patterns, is known as\r\n“massing,” or “massing in color,” and sometimes is spoken of as\r\n“carpet-bedding.”\r\n\r\nCarpet-bedding, however, belongs more properly to a style of bedding in\r\nwhich plants of dense, low, spreading habit—chiefly foliage plants,\r\nwith leaves of different forms and colors—are planted in patterns not\r\nunlike carpets or rugs. It is often necessary to keep the plants\r\nsheared into limits. Carpet-bedding is such a specialized form of\r\nplant-growing that we shall treat of it separately.\r\n\r\nBeds containing the large foliage plants, for producing tropical\r\neffects, are composed, in the main, of subjects that are allowed to\r\ndevelop naturally. In the lower and more orderly massing, the plants\r\nare arranged not only in circles and patterns according to habit and\r\nheight, but the selection is such that some or all may be kept within\r\nproper limits by pinching or trimming. Circles or masses composed of\r\nflowering plants usually cannot be cut back at the top, so that the\r\nhabit of the plants must be known before planting; and the plants must\r\nbe placed in parts of the bed where trimming will not be necessary.\r\nThey may be clipped at the sides, however, in case the branches or\r\nleaves of one mass or line in the pattern grow beyond their proper\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of good annuals and perennials that may be used in\r\nflower-beds are now very large, and one may have a wide choice. Various\r\nlists from which one may choose are given at the end of this chapter;\r\nbut special comment may be made on those most suitable for bedding, and\r\nin its modification in ribbon-work and sub-tropical massing.\r\n\r\nBedding effects.\r\n\r\nBedding is ordinarily a temporary species of planting; that is, the bed\r\nis filled anew each year. However, the term may be used to designate a\r\npermanent plantation in which the plants are heavily massed so as to\r\ngive one continuous or emphatic display of form or color. Some of the\r\nbest permanent bedding masses are made of the various hardy ornamental\r\ngrasses, as eulalias, arundo, and the like. The color effects in\r\nbedding may be secured with flowers or with foliage.\r\n\r\nSummer bedding is often made by perennial plants that are carried over\r\nfrom the preceding year, or better, that are propagated for that\r\nparticular purpose in February and March. Such plants as geranium,\r\ncoleus, alyssum, scarlet salvia, ageratum, and heliotrope may be used\r\nfor these beds. It is a common practice to use geranium plants which\r\nare in bloom during the winter for bedding out during the summer, but\r\nsuch plants are tall and ungainly in form and have expended the greater\r\npart of their energies. It is better to propagate new plants by taking\r\ncuttings or slips late in the winter and setting out young fresh\r\nvigorous subjects. (Page 30.)\r\n\r\nSome bedding is very temporary in its effect. Especially is this true\r\nof spring bedding, in which the subjects are tulips, hyacinths,\r\ncrocuses, or other early-flowering bulbous plants. In this case, the\r\nground is usually occupied later in the season by other plants. These\r\nlater plants are commonly annuals, the seeds of which are sown amongst\r\nthe bulbs as soon as the season is far enough advanced; or the annuals\r\nmay be started in boxes and the plants transplanted amongst the bulbs\r\nas soon as the weather is fit.\r\n\r\nMany of the low-growing and compact continuous-flowering annuals are\r\nexcellent for summer bedding effects. There is a list of some useful\r\nmaterial for this purpose on page 249.\r\n\r\nPlants for subtropical effects (Plates IV and V).\r\n\r\nThe number of plants suitable to produce a semitropical mass or for the\r\ncenter or back of a group, which may be readily grown from seed, is\r\nlimited. Some of the best kinds, are included below.\r\n\r\nIt will often be worth while to supplement these with others, to be had\r\nat the florists, such as caladiums, screw pines, _Ficus elastica,_\r\naraucarias, _Musa Ensete_, palms, dracenas, crotons, and others.\r\nDahlias and tuberous begonias are also useful. About a pond the papyrus\r\nand lotus may be used.\r\n\r\nPractically all the plants used for this style of gardening are liable\r\nto injury from winds, and therefore the beds should be placed in a\r\nprotected situation. The palms and some other greenhouse stuff do\r\nbetter if partially shaded.\r\n\r\nIn the use of such plants, there are opportunities for the exercise of\r\nthe nicest taste. A gross feeder, as the ricinus, in the midst of a bed\r\nof delicate annuals, is quite out of place; and a stately,\r\nroyal-looking plant among humbler kinds often makes the latter look\r\ncommon, when if headed with a chief of their own rank all would appear\r\nto the best advantage.\r\n\r\nSome of the plants much used for subtropical bedding, and often started\r\nfor that purpose in a greenhouse or coldframe, are:—\r\n\r\nAcalypha.\r\nAmarantus.\r\nAralia Sieboldii (properly Fatsia Japonica).\r\nBamboos.\r\nCaladium and colocasia.\r\nCanna.\r\nCoxcomb, particularly the new “foliage” kinds.\r\nGrasses, as eulalias, pampas-grass, pennisetums.\r\nGunnera.\r\nMaize, the striped form.\r\nRicinus or castor bean.\r\nScarlet sage.\r\nWigandia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aquatic and bog plants_.\r\n\r\nSome of the most interesting and ornamental of all plants grow in water\r\nand in wet places. It is possible to make an aquatic flower-garden, and\r\nalso to use water and bog plants as a part of the landscape work.\r\n\r\nThe essential consideration in the growing of aquatics is the making of\r\nthe pond. It is possible to grow water-lilies in tubs and half barrels;\r\nbut this does not provide sufficient room, and the plant-food is likely\r\nsoon to be exhausted and the plants to fail. The small quantity of\r\nwater is likely also to become foul.\r\n\r\nThe best ponds are those made by good mason work, for the water does\r\nnot become muddy by working among the plants. In cement ponds it is\r\nbest to plant the roots of water-lilies in shallow boxes of earth (1\r\nfoot deep and 3 or 4 feet square), or to hold the earth in mason-work\r\ncompartments.\r\n\r\n\r\nX: A shallow lawn pond, containing water-lilies, variegated sweet flag,\r\niris, and subtropical bedding at the rear; fountain covered with\r\nparrot’s feather _(Myriophyllum proserpinacoides_). X: A shallow lawn\r\npond, containing water-lilies, variegated sweet flag, iris, and\r\nsubtropical bedding at the rear; fountain covered with parrot’s feather\r\n_(Myriophyllum proserpinacoides_).\r\n\r\nUsually the ponds or tanks are not cement lined. In some soils a simple\r\nexcavation will hold water, but it is usually necessary to give the\r\ntank some kind of lining. Clay is often used. The bottom and sides of\r\nthe tank are pounded firm, and then covered with 3 to 6 in. of clay,\r\nwhich has been kneaded in the hands, or pounded and worked in a box.\r\nHandfuls or shovelfuls of the material are thrown forcibly upon the\r\nearth, the operator being careful not to walk upon the work. The clay\r\nis smoothed by means of a spade or maul, and it is then sanded.\r\n\r\nThe water for the lily pond may be derived from a brook, spring, well,\r\nor a city water supply. The plants will thrive in any water that is\r\nused for domestic purposes. It is important that the water does not\r\nbecome stagnant and a breeding place for mosquitoes. There should be an\r\noutlet in the nature of a stand-pipe, that will control the depth of\r\nwater. It is not necessary that the water run through the pond or tank\r\nrapidly, but only that a slow change take place. Sometimes the water is\r\nallowed to enter through a fountain-vase, in which water plants (such\r\nas parrot’s feather) may be grown (Plate X).\r\n\r\nIn all ponds, a foot or 15 in. is sufficient depth of water to stand\r\nabove the crowns of the plants; and the greatest depth of water should\r\nnot be more than 3 ft. for all kinds of water-lilies. Half this depth\r\nis often sufficient. The soil should be 1 to 2 ft. deep, and very rich.\r\nOld cow manure may be mixed with rich loam. For the nympheas or\r\nwater-lilies, 9 to 12 in. of soil is sufficient. Most of the foreign\r\nwater-lilies are not hardy, but some of them may be grown with ease if\r\nthe pond is covered in winter.\r\n\r\nRoots of hardy water-lilies may be planted as soon as the pond is clear\r\nof frost, but the tender kinds (which are also to be taken up in the\r\nfall) should not be planted till it is time to plant out geraniums.\r\nSink the roots into the mud so that they are just buried, and weight\r\nthem down with a stone or clod. The nelumbium, or so-called Egyptian\r\nlotus, should not be transplanted till growth begins to show in the\r\nroots in the spring. The roots are cleaned of decayed parts and covered\r\nwith about 3 in. of soil. A foot or so of water is sufficient for lotus\r\nponds. The roots of Egyptian lotus must not freeze. The roots of all\r\nwater-lily-like plants should be frequently divided and renewed.\r\n\r\nWith hardy aquatics, the water and roots are allowed to remain\r\nnaturally over winter. In very cold climates, the pond is protected by\r\nthrowing boards over it and covering with hay, straw, or evergreen\r\nboughs. It is well to supply an additional depth of water as a further\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nAs a landscape feature, the pond should have a background, or setting,\r\nand its edges should be relieved, at least on sides and back, by\r\nplantings of bog plants. In permanent ponds of large size, plantings of\r\nwillows, osiers, and other shrubbery may set off the area to advantage.\r\nMany of the wild marsh and pond plants are excellent for marginal\r\nplantings, as sedges, cat-tail, sweet-flag (there is a striped-leaved\r\nform), and some of the marsh grasses. Japanese iris makes an excellent\r\neffect in such places. For summer planting in or near ponds, caladium,\r\numbrella-plant, and papyrus are good.\r\n\r\nIf there is a stream, “branch,” or “run” through the place, it may\r\noften be made one of the most attractive parts of the premises by\r\ncolonizing bog plants along it.\r\n\r\n_Rockeries, and alpine plants_.\r\n\r\nA rockery is a part of the place in which plants are grown in pockets\r\nbetween rocks. It is a flower-garden conception rather than a landscape\r\nfeature, and therefore should be at one side or in the rear of the\r\npremises. Primarily, the object of using the rocks is to provide better\r\nconditions in which certain plants may grow; sometimes the rocks are\r\nemployed to hold a springy or sloughing bank and the plants are used to\r\ncover the rocks; now and then a person wants a rock or a pile of stones\r\nin his yard, as another person would want a piece of statuary or a\r\nsheared evergreen. Sometimes the rocks are natural to the place and\r\ncannot well be removed; in this case the planning and planting should\r\nbe such as to make them part of the picture.\r\n\r\nThe real rock-garden, however, is a place in which to grow plants. The\r\nrocks are secondary. The rocks should not appear to be placed for\r\ndisplay. If one is making a collection of rocks, he is pursuing geology\r\nrather than gardening.\r\n\r\nYet many of the so-called rock-gardens are mere heaps of stones, placed\r\nwhere it seems to be convenient to pile stones rather than where the\r\nstones may improve conditions for the growing of plants.\r\n\r\nThe plants that will naturally grow in rock pockets are those requiring\r\na continuous supply of root moisture and a cool atmosphere. To place a\r\nrockery on a sand bank in the burning sun is therefore entirely out of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nRock-garden plants are those of cool woods, of bogs, and particularly\r\nof high mountains and alpine regions. It is generally understood that a\r\nrock-garden is an alpine-garden, although this is not necessarily so.\r\n\r\nIn this country alpine-gardening is little known, largely because of\r\nour hot dry summers and falls. But if one has a rather cool exposure\r\nand an unfailing water supply, he may succeed fairly well with many of\r\nthe alpines, or at least with the semi-alpines.\r\n\r\nMost of the alpines are low and often tufted plants, and bloom in a\r\nspring temperature. In our long hot seasons, the alpine-garden may be\r\nexpected to be dormant during much of the summer, unless other\r\nrock-loving plants are colonized in it. Alpine plants are of many\r\nkinds. They are specially to be found in the genera arenaria, silene,\r\ndiapensia, primula, saxifraga, arabis, aubrietia, veronica, campanula,\r\ngentiana. They comprise a good number of ferns and many little heaths.\r\n\r\nA good rock-garden of any kind does not have the stones piled merely on\r\nthe surface; they are sunken well into the ground and are so placed\r\nthat there are deep chambers or channels that hold moisture and into\r\nwhich roots may penetrate. The pockets are filled with good fibrous\r\nmoisture-holding earth, and often a little sphagnum or other moss is\r\nadded. It must then be arranged so that the pockets never dry out.\r\n\r\nRock-gardens are usually failures, because they violate these very\r\nsimple elementary principles; but even when the soil conditions and\r\nmoisture conditions are good, the habits of the rock plants must be\r\nlearned, and this requires thoughtful experience. Rock-gardens cannot\r\nbe generally recommended.\r\n\r\n1. PLANTS FOR CARPET-BEDS\r\n(By Ernest Walker)\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the carpet-bed lies largely in its unity, sharp contrast\r\nand harmony of color, elegance—often simplicity—of design, nicety of\r\nexecution, and the continued distinctness of outline due to scrupulous\r\ncare. A generous allowance of green-sward on all sides contributes\r\ngreatly to the general effect,—in fact it is indispensable.\r\n\r\nWhatever place is chosen for the bed, it should be in a sunny exposure.\r\nThis, nor any kind of bed, should not be planted near large trees, as\r\ntheir greedy roots will rob the soil not only of its food, but of\r\nmoisture. The shade also will be a menace. As the plants stand so\r\nthick, the soil should be well enriched, and spaded at least a foot\r\ndeep. In planting, a space of at least six inches must be left between\r\nthe outer row of plants and the edge of the grass. The very style of\r\nthe bed requires that lines be straight, the curves uniform, and that\r\nthey be kept so by the frequent and careful use of the shears. During\r\ndry periods watering will be necessary. The beds, however, should not\r\nbe watered in the hot sunshine. Foliage plants are most in use, and are\r\nthe ones which will prove the most satisfactory in the hands of the\r\ninexperienced, as they submit to severe clipping and are thus more\r\neasily managed.\r\n\r\nThe following list will be helpful to the beginner. It embraces a\r\nnumber of the plants in common use for carpet-bedding, although not all\r\nof them. The usual heights are given in inches. This, of course, in\r\ndifferent soils and under different treatment is more or less a\r\nvariable quantity. The figures in parentheses suggest in inches\r\nsuitable distances for planting in the row when immediate effects are\r\nexpected. A verbena in rich soil will in time cover a circle three feet\r\nor more in diameter; other plants mentioned spread considerably; but\r\nwhen used in the carpet-bed, they must be planted close. One cannot\r\nwait for them to grow. The aim is to cover the ground at once. Although\r\nplanted thick in the row, it will be desirable to leave more room\r\nbetween the rows in case of spreading plants like the verbena. Most of\r\nthem, however, need little if any more space between the rows than is\r\nindicated by the figures given. In the list those plants that bear free\r\nclipping are marked with *:\r\n\r\n_Lists for carpet-beds._\r\n\r\n_The figure immediately following the name of plant indicates its\r\nheight, the figures in parentheses the distance for planting, in\r\ninches_.\r\n\r\n1.

They are\r\nintended merely to be suggestive, not to be copied precisely. The\r\nsimple forms and component parts of the more elaborate beds may be\r\narranged into other designs. Likewise the arrangement of plants, which\r\nwill be mentioned as suitable for making a given pattern, is only one\r\nof many possible combinations. The idea is merely to bring out the\r\ndesign distinctly. To accomplish this it is only necessary to use\r\nplants of contrasting color or growth. To illustrate how varied are the\r\narrangements that may be used, and how easily different effects are\r\nproduced with a single design, several different combinations of color\r\nfor the bed No. 1 will be mentioned:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 240. Designs for carpet-beds.]\r\n\r\nNo. 1.—Arrangement A: Outside, Alternanthera amœna spectabilis; inside,\r\nStevia serrata variegata. B: lobelia, Crystal Palace; Mme. Salleroi\r\ngeranium. C: lobelia, Crystal Palace; scarlet dwarf phlox. D: sweet\r\nalyssum; petunia, Countess of Ellesmere. E: coleus, Golden Bedder;\r\nColeus Verschaffeltii. F: Achyranthes Lindeni; yellow dwarf nasturtium.\r\n\r\nNo. 2.—Outside, red alternanthera; middle, dusty miller; center, pink\r\ngeranium.\r\n\r\nNo. 3.—Outside, Alternanthera aurea nana; middle, Alternanthera amœna\r\nspectabilis; center, Anthemis coronaria.\r\n\r\nNo. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 may each be filled with a single color, or given\r\na border of suitable plants if the planter so chooses.\r\n\r\nNo. 9.—Ground, Alternanthera aurea nana; center, Acalypha tricolor;\r\nblack dots, scarlet geranium.\r\n\r\nNo. 10.—Ground of Centaurea gymnocarpa; circle, Achyranthes Lindeni;\r\ncross, Golden coleus.\r\n\r\nNo. 11.—Border, Oxalis tropæoloides; center, blue heliotrope, blue\r\nageratum, or Acalypha marginata; cross about the center, Thymus\r\nargenteus, or centaurea; scallop outside the cross, blue lobelia;\r\ncorners, inside border, santolina.\r\n\r\nDesigns 13 and 14 are, in character, somewhat in the style of a\r\nparterre; but instead of the intervening spaces in the bed being\r\nordinary walks they are of grass. Such beds are of a useful type,\r\nbecause they may be made large and yet be executed with a comparatively\r\nsmall number of plants. They are especially suitable for the center of\r\nan open plot of lawn with definite formal boundaries on all sides, such\r\nas walks or drives. Whether they are to be composed of tall-growing or\r\nof low-growing plants will depend upon the distance they are to be from\r\nthe observer. For a moderate-sized plot the following plants might be\r\nused:—\r\n\r\nNo. 13.—Border, red alternanthera; second row, dwarf orange or yellow\r\nnasturtium; third row, Achyranthes Gilsoni, or Acalypha tricolor;\r\ncentral square, scarlet geraniums, with a border of Centaurea\r\ngymnocarpa; intervening spaces, grass. Instead of the square of\r\ngeraniums, a vase might be substituted, or a clump of Salvia splendens.\r\n\r\nNo. 14.—Composite beds like this and the former are always suggestive.\r\nThey contain various features which may readily be recombined into\r\nother patterns. Sometimes it may be convenient to use only portions of\r\nthe design. The reader should feel that no arrangement is arbitrary,\r\nbut merely a suggestion that he may use with the utmost freedom, only\r\nkeeping harmony in view. For No. 14, the following may be an acceptable\r\nplanting arrangement: Border, Mme. Salleroi geranium; small dots, dwarf\r\nscarlet tropeolum; diamonds, blue lobelia; crescents, Stevia serrata\r\nvariegata; inner border, crimson achyranthes or coleus; loops,\r\nCentaurea gymnocarpa; wedge-shaped portions, scarlet geranium.\r\n\r\nNo. 15.—Suitable for a corner. Border, red alternanthera; second row,\r\nAlternanthera aurea nana; third row, red alternanthera; center,\r\nEcheveria Californica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 241. Carpet-bed for a bay or recession in the\r\nborder planting.]\r\n\r\nNo. 16—Border, crimson alternanthera (another border of yellow\r\nalternanthera might be placed inside of this); ground, Echeveria\r\nsecunda glauca; inner border, Oxalis tropæoloides; center,\r\nAlternanthera aurea nana. Or, inner border, Echeveria Californica;\r\ncenter, crimson alternanthera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 242. Another circular carpet-bed.]\r\n\r\nNo. 17.—Another bed intended to fill an angle. Its curved side will\r\nalso fit it for use with a circular design. Border, dwarf blue\r\nageratum; circle, blue lobelia; ground (3 parts), crimson\r\nalternanthera.\r\n\r\nOther carpet or mosaic beds (after Long), with the plants indicated,\r\nare shown in Figs. 241, 242.\r\n\r\n2. THE ANNUAL PLANTS\r\n\r\nThe annual flowers of the seedsmen are those that give their best bloom\r\nin the very year in which the seeds are sown. True annuals are those\r\nplants that complete their entire life-cycle in one season. Some of the\r\nso-called annual flowers will continue to bloom the second and third\r\nyears, but the bloom is so poor and sparse after the first season that\r\nit does not pay to keep them. Some perennials may be treated as annuals\r\nby starting the seeds early; Chinese pink, pansy and snapdragon are\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nThe regular biennials may be treated practically as annuals; that is,\r\nseeds may be sown every year, and after the first year, therefore, a\r\nseasonal succession of bloom may be had. Of such are adlumia,\r\nCanterbury bell, lunaria, ipomopsis, Œnothera Lamarckiana; and\r\nfoxglove, valerian, and some other perennials would better be treated\r\nas biennials.\r\n\r\nMost annuals will bloom in central New York if the seeds are sown in\r\nthe open ground when the weather becomes thoroughly settled. But there\r\nare some kinds, as the late cosmos and moon-flowers, for which the\r\nnorthern season is commonly too short to give good bloom unless they\r\nare started very early indoors.\r\n\r\nIf flowers of any annual are wanted extra early, the seeds should be\r\nstarted under cover. A greenhouse is not necessary for this purpose,\r\nalthough best results are to be expected with such a building. The seed\r\nmay be sown in boxes, and these boxes then placed in a sheltered\r\nposition on the warm side of a building. At night they may be covered\r\nwith boards or matting. In very cold “spells” the boxes should be\r\nbrought inside. In this simple way seeds may often be started one to\r\nthree weeks ahead of the time when they can be sown in the open garden.\r\nMoreover, the plants are likely to receive better care in these boxes,\r\nand therefore to grow more rapidly. Of course, if still earlier results\r\nare desired, the seed should be sown in the kitchen, hotbed, coldframe,\r\nor in a greenhouse. In starting plants ahead of the season, be careful\r\nnot to use too deep boxes. The gardener’s “flat” may be taken as a\r\nsuggestion. Three inches of earth is sufficient, and in some cases (as\r\nwhen the plants are started late) half this depth is enough.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with early sown seedlings is “drawing up,” and weakness\r\nfrom crowding and want of light. This is most liable to occur with\r\nwindow-grown plants. Vigorous June-sown plants are better than such\r\nweaklings. It must be remembered that very early bloom usually means\r\nthe shortening of the season at the other end; this may be remedied to\r\nsome extent by making sowings at different times.\r\n\r\nThe “hardy” annuals are such as develop readily without the aid of\r\nartificial heat. They are commonly sown in May or earlier, directly in\r\nthe open ground where they are to grow. Florists often sow certain\r\nkinds in the fall, and winter the young plants in coldframes. They may\r\nalso be wintered under a covering of leaves or evergreen boughs. Some\r\nof the hardy annuals (as sweet pea) withstand considerable frost. The\r\n“half-hardy” and “tender” annuals are alike in that they require more\r\nwarmth for their germination and growth. The tender kinds are very\r\nquickly sensitive to frost. Both these, like the hardy kinds, may be\r\nsown in the open ground, but not until the weather has become settled\r\nand warm, which for the tender kinds will not commonly be before the\r\nfirst of June; but the tender kinds, at least, are preferably started\r\nin the house and transplanted to their outdoor beds. Of course, these\r\nterms are wholly relative. What may be a tender annual in Massachusetts\r\nmay be a hardy annual or even a perennial in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThese terms as ordinarily used in this country refer to the northern\r\nstates, or not farther south than middle Atlantic states.\r\n\r\nSome familiar examples of hardy annuals are sweet alyssum, ageratum,\r\ncalendula, calliopsis, candytuft, Centaurea Cyanus, clarkia, larkspur,\r\ngilia, California poppy, morning-glory, marigold, mignonette,\r\nnemophila, pansy, phlox, pinks, poppies, portulaca, zinnia, sweet pea,\r\nscabiosa.\r\n\r\nExamples of half-hardy annuals are: China aster, alonsoa, balsam,\r\npetunia, ricinus, stocks, balloon-vine, martynia, salpiglossis,\r\nthunbergia, nasturtium, verbena.\r\n\r\nExamples of tender annuals: Amarantus, celosia or coxcomb, cosmos,\r\ncotton, Lobelia Erinus, cobea, gourds, ice-plant, sensitive-plant,\r\nsolanums, torenia, and such things as dahlias, caladiums, and acalypha\r\nused for bedding and subtropical effects.\r\n\r\nSome annuals do not bear transplanting well; as poppies, bartonia,\r\nVenus’ looking-glass, the dwarf convolvulus, lupinus, and malope. It is\r\nbest, therefore, to sow them where they are to grow.\r\n\r\nSome kinds (as poppies) do not bloom all summer, more especially not if\r\nallowed to produce seed. Of such kinds a second or third sowing at\r\nintervals will provide a succession. Preventing the formation of seeds\r\nprolongs their life and flowering period.\r\n\r\nA few of the annuals thrive in partial shade or where they receive\r\nsunshine for half the day; but most of them prefer a sunny situation.\r\n\r\nAny good garden soil is suitable for annuals. If not naturally fertile\r\nand friable, it should be made so by the application of well-rotted\r\nstable-manure or humus. The spading should be at least one foot deep.\r\nThe upper six inches is then to be given a second turning to pulverize\r\nand mix it. After making the surface fine and smooth the soil should be\r\npressed down with a board. The seed may now be sprinkled on the soil in\r\nlines or concentric circles, according to the method desired. After\r\ncovering the seed, the soil should be again pressed down with a board.\r\nThis promotes capillarity, by which the surface of the soil is better\r\nsupplied with moisture from below. Always mark with a label the kind\r\nand position of all seed sown.\r\n\r\nIf the flowers are to be grown about the edges of the lawn, make sure\r\nthat the grass roots do not run underneath them and rob them of food\r\nand moisture. It is well to run a sharp spade deep into the ground\r\nabout the edges of the bed every two or three weeks for the purpose of\r\ncutting off any grass roots that may have run into the bed. If beds are\r\nmade in the turf, see that they are 3 ft. or more wide, so that the\r\ngrass roots will not undermine them. Against the shrub borders, this\r\nprecaution may not be necessary. In fact, it is desirable that the\r\nflowers fill all the space between the overhanging branches and the\r\nsod.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how few of the uncommon or little known annuals really\r\nhave great merit for general purposes. There is nothing yet to take the\r\nplace of the old-time groups, such as amaranths, zinnias, calendulas,\r\ndaturas, balsams, annual pinks, candytufts, bachelor’s buttons,\r\nwallflowers, larkspurs, petunias, gaillardias, snapdragons, coxcombs,\r\nlobelias, coreopsis or calliopsis, California poppies, four-o’clocks,\r\nsweet sultans, phloxes, mignonettes, scabiosas, nasturtiums, marigolds,\r\nChina asters, salpiglossis, nicotianas, pansies, portulacas, castor\r\nbeans, poppies, sunflowers, verbenas, stocks, alyssums, and such good\r\nold running plants as scarlet runners, sweet peas, convolvuluses,\r\nipomeas, tall nasturtiums, balloon vines, cobeas. Of the annual vines\r\nof recent introduction, the Japanese hop has at once taken a prominent\r\nplace for the covering of fences and arbors, although it has no floral\r\nbeauty to recommend it.\r\n\r\nFor bold mass-displays of color in the rear parts of the grounds or\r\nalong the borders, some of the coarser species are desirable. Good\r\nplants for such use are: sunflower and castor bean for the back rows;\r\nzinnias for bright effects in the scarlets and lilacs; African\r\nmarigolds for brilliant yellows; nicotianas for whites. Unfortunately,\r\nwe have no robust-growing annuals with good blues. Some of the\r\nlarkspurs and the browallias are perhaps the nearest approach to them.\r\n\r\nFor lower-growing and less gross mass-displays, the following are good:\r\nCalifornia poppies for oranges and yellows; sweet sultans for purples,\r\nwhites, and pale yellows; petunias for purples, violets, and whites;\r\nlarkspurs for blues and violets; bachelor’s buttons (or cornflowers)\r\nfor blues; calliopsis and coreopsis and calendulas for yellows;\r\ngaillardias for red-yellows and orange-reds; China asters for many\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nFor still less robustness, good mass-displays can be made with the\r\nfollowing: alyssums and candytufts for whites; phloxes for whites and\r\nvarious pinks and reds; lobelias and browallias for blues; pinks for\r\nwhites and various shades of pink; stocks for whites and reds;\r\nwallflowers for brown-yellows; verbenas for many colors.\r\n\r\nA garden of pleasant annual flowers is not complete that does not\r\ncontain some of the “everlastings” or immortelles. These “paper\r\nflowers” are always interesting to children. They are not so desirable\r\nfor the making of “dry bouquets” as for their value as a part of a\r\ngarden. The colors are bright, the blooms hold long on the plant, and\r\nmost of the kinds are very easy to grow. My favorite groups are the\r\ndifferent kinds of xeranthemums and helichrysums. The globe amaranths,\r\nwith clover-like heads (sometimes known as bachelor’s buttons), are\r\ngood old favorites. Rhodanthes and acrocliniums are also good and\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\nThe ornamental grasses should not be overlooked.

The following lists are made from Bulletin\r\n161 of the Cornell Experiment Station, which gives tabular data on many\r\nannuals grown at Ithaca, N.Y. Seeds of most of the kinds were sown in\r\nthe open, rather late. “The soil varied somewhat, but it was light and\r\nwell tilled, and only moderately rich.” Ordinary good care was given\r\nthe plants. The average height of the plants of each kind at full\r\ngrowth, as they stood on the ground, is given in these lists. Of\r\ncourse, these heights might be less or more with different soils,\r\ndifferent treatments, and different climates; but the figures are\r\nfairly comparable among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe measurements are based on the stock supplied by leading seedsmen\r\nunder the trade names here given. It is not unlikely that some of the\r\ndiscrepancies were due to mixture of seed or to stock being untrue to\r\ntype; some of it may have been due to soil conditions. The same name\r\nmay be found in two divisions in some instances, the plants having been\r\ngrown from different lots of seeds. The lists will indicate to the\r\ngrower what variations he may expect in any large lot of seeds.\r\n\r\nSeedsmen’s catalogues should be consulted for what the trade considers\r\nto be the proper and normal heights for the different plants.\r\n\r\nPlants 6-8 in. high\r\n\r\n\r\nAbronia umbellata grandiflora.\r\nAlyssum compactum.\r\nCallirrhoë involucrata.\r\nGodetia, Bijou, Lady Albemarle, and Lady Satin Rose.\r\nGypsophila muralis.\r\nKaulfussia amelloides.\r\nLeptosiphon hybridus.\r\nLinaria Maroccana.\r\nLobelia Erinus and Erinus Elegant.\r\nNemophila atomaria, discoidalis, insignis, and maculata.\r\nNolana lanceolata, paradoxa, prostrata, and atriplicifolia.\r\nPodolepis chrysantha and affinis.\r\nPortulaca.\r\nRhodanthe Manglesii.\r\nSedum caeruleum.\r\nSilene pendula ruberrima.\r\nVerbena.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants 9-12 in. high\r\n\r\n\r\nAlyssum.\r\nAsperula setosa azurea.\r\nBrachycome iberidifolia.\r\nCalandrinia umbellata elegans.\r\nCallirrhoë pedata nana.\r\nCentaurea Cyanus Victoria Dwarf Compact.\r\nCentranthus macrosiphon nanus.\r\nCollinsia bicolor, candidissima and multicolor marmorata.\r\nConvolvulus minor and tricolor.\r\nEschscholtzia crocea.\r\nGamolepis Tagetes.\r\nGilia laciniata and linifolia.\r\nGodetia Duchess of Albany, Prince of Wales, Fairy Queen, Brilliant,\r\ngrandiflora maculata, Whitneyi, Duke of Fife, rubicunda splendens.\r\nHelipterum corymbiflorum.\r\nIberis affinis.\r\nKaulfussia amelloides atroviolacea, and a. kermesina.\r\nLeptosiphon androsaceus and densiflorus.\r\nLinaria bipartita splendida.\r\nMatthiola dwarf Forcing Snowflake, Wallflower-leaved.\r\nMesembryanthemum crystallinum.\r\nMimulus cupreus.\r\nNemophila atomaria oculata and marginata.\r\nNigella.\r\nNolana atriplicifolia.\r\nOmphalodes linifolia.\r\nŒnothera rosea and tetraptera.\r\nPhlox, Large-flowering Dwarf and Dwarf Snowball.\r\nRhodanthe maculata.\r\nSaponaria Calabrica.\r\nSchizanthus pinnatus.\r\nSilene Armeria and pendula.\r\nSpecularia.\r\nViscaria oculata cserulea.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants 13-17 in. high\r\n\r\n\r\nAbronia umbellata.\r\nAcroclinium album and roseum.\r\nBrachycome iberidifolia alba.\r\nBrowallia Czerniakowski and elata.\r\nCacalia.\r\nCalandrinia grandiflora.\r\nCalendula sulphurea flore pleno.\r\nChrysanthemum carinatum.\r\nCollomia coccinea.\r\nConvolvulus minor and minor unicaulis.\r\nDianthus, the Margaret varieties, Dwarf Perpetual, Caryophyllus\r\n  semperflorens, Chinensis, dentosus hybridus, Heddewigii, imperialis,\r\n  laciniatus, plumarius, superbus dwarf, picotee, Comtesse de Paris.\r\nElsholtzia cristata.\r\nEschscholtzia Californica, Mandarin, maritima and tenuifolia.\r\nGaillardia picta.\r\nGilia achillesefolia alba and nivalis.\r\nHelipterum Sanfordii.\r\nHieracium, Bearded.\r\nIberis amara, coronaria Empress, coronaria White Rocket,\r\nSweet-scented, umbellata, umbellata carnea, and umbellata lilacina.\r\nLeptosiphon carmineus.\r\nLupinus nanus, sulphureus.\r\nMalope grandiflora.\r\nMatthiola, Wallflower-leaved and Virginian stock.\r\nMirabilis alba.\r\nNigella.\r\nŒnothera Lamarckiana.\r\nPalafoxia Hookeriana.\r\nPapaver, Shirley and glaucum.\r\nPetunia.\r\nPhlox of many kinds.\r\nSalvia Horminum.\r\nSchizanthus papilionaceus.\r\nStatice Thouini and superba.\r\nTagetes, Pride of the Garden and Dwarf.\r\nTropaeolum, many kinds of dwarf.\r\nVenidium calendulaceum.\r\nVerbena of several kinds.\r\nViscaria Cœli-rosa, elegans picta, oculata, and oculata alba.\r\nWhitlavia gloxinioides.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants 18-23 in. high\r\n\r\n\r\nAdonis aestivalis and autumnalis.\r\nAmarantus atropurpureus.\r\nCalendula officinalis, Meteor, suffruticosa, and pluvialis.\r\nCalliopsis bicolor marmorata.\r\nCallirrhoë pedata.\r\nCentaurea Cyanus minor Blue and suaveolens.\r\nCentranthus macrosiphon.\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 245.

If specimen plants are to be raised, the\r\ndistances should be liberal.\r\n\r\nThe distances here given for some of the commoner annuals may be\r\nconsidered to represent average or usual spaces that single plants may\r\noccupy under ordinary conditions in flowerbeds, although it would\r\nprobably be impossible to find any two gardeners or seedsmen who would\r\nagree on the details. These are suggestions rather than\r\nrecommendations. It is always well to set or sow more plants than are\r\nwanted, for there is danger of loss from cut-worms and other causes.\r\nThe general tendency is to let the plants stand too close together at\r\nmaturity. In case of doubt, place plants described in books and\r\ncatalogues as very dwarf at six inches, those as medium-sized at twelve\r\ninches, very large growers at two feet, and thin them out if they seem\r\nto demand it as they grow.\r\n\r\nThe plants in these lists are thrown into four groups (rather than all\r\nplaced together with the numbers after them) in order to classify the\r\nsubject in the beginner’s mind.\r\n\r\n6 to 9 inches apart\r\n\r\n\r\nAgeratum, very dwarf kinds.\r\nAlyssum.\r\nAsperula setosa.\r\nCacalia.\r\nCandytuft.\r\nClarkia, dwarf.\r\nCollinsia.\r\nGysophila muralis.\r\nKaulfussia.\r\nLarkspur, dwarf kinds.\r\nLinaria.\r\nLinum grandiflorum\r\nLobelia Erinus.

HARDY HERBACEOUS PERENNIALS\r\n\r\nThere is a rapidly growing appreciation of perennial herbs, not only as\r\nflower-garden and lawn subjects, but as parts of native landscapes.\r\nEvery locality yields its wild asters, golden-rods, columbines, iris,\r\ntrilliums, lilies, anemones, pentstemons, mints, sunflowers, or other\r\nplants; and many of these also make good subjects for the home grounds.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that some perennial herbs begin to fail\r\nafter one to three seasons of full bloom. It is a good plan to have new\r\nplants coming on to take their place; or the old roots may be taken up\r\nin the fall and divided, only the fresh and strong parts being planted\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nPerennial herbs are propagated in various ways,—by seeds, and by\r\ncuttings of the stems and roots, but mostly by the easy method of\r\ndivision. On the raising of these plants from seeds, William Falconer\r\nwrites as follows in Dreer’s “Garden Book” for 1909:—\r\n\r\n“Hardy perennials are easily grown from seed. In many cases they are a\r\nlittle slower than annuals, but with intelligent care they are\r\nsuccessfully raised, and from seed is an excellent way to get up a big\r\nstock of perennials. Many sorts, if sown in spring, bloom the first\r\nyear from seeds as early as annuals; for instance: gaillardia, Iceland\r\npoppies, Chinese larkspur, platycodon, etc. Others do not bloom until\r\nthe second year.\r\n\r\n“The amateur may have more success and less bother growing perennials\r\nfrom seed sown in the open ground than from any other way. Prepare a\r\nbed in a nice, warm, sheltered spot in the garden, preferably not very\r\nsunny. Let the surface of the bed be raised four or five inches above\r\nthe general level, and the soil be a mellow fine earth on the surface.\r\nDraw shallow rows across the surface of the bed three or four inches\r\napart, and here sow the seeds, keeping the varieties of one kind or\r\nnature as much together as practicable, covering the seeds thinly;\r\npress the whole surface gently, water moderately, then dust a little\r\nfine loose soil over all. If the weather is sunny or windy, shade with\r\npapers or a few branches, but remove these in the evening. When the\r\nseedlings come up, thin them out to stiffen those that are left, and\r\nwhen they are two or three inches high, they are fit for transplanting\r\ninto permanent quarters. All this should be done in early spring, say\r\nMarch, April, or May. Again, in July or August perennials are very\r\neasily raised out of doors, and much in the same way as above. Or they\r\nmay be sown in early spring indoors, in the window, the hotbed, the\r\ncoldframe, or the greenhouse, preferably in boxes or pans, as for\r\ngrowing annuals. Some gardeners sow seed right in the coldframe. I have\r\ntried both ways, and find the boxes best, as the different varieties of\r\nseeds do not come up at the same time, and you can remove them from the\r\nclose frame to more airy quarters as soon as the seed comes up,\r\nwhereas, if sown in a frame, you would have to give them all the same\r\ntreatment. When the seedlings are large enough, I transplant them into\r\nother boxes, and put them into a shady part of the garden, but not\r\nunder the shade of trees, as there they will ‘draw’ too much. About the\r\nfifteenth of September plant them in the garden where they are to\r\nbloom, or if the garden is full of summer-flowering plants, put them in\r\nbeds in the vegetable garden, to be planted out in the early spring,\r\nand give them a light covering of straw or manure to keep sudden\r\nchanges of the weather away from them.”\r\n\r\nHardy perennial herbs may be planted in September and October with\r\nexcellent results; also in spring. See that they are protected with\r\nmulch in winter.\r\n\r\n_Perennial herbs suitable for lawn and “planting” effects._\r\n\r\nSome of the striking plants that are valuable for lawn planting in the\r\nNorth, chosen chiefly on account of their size, foliage, and habit, are\r\nmentioned in the following brief list.

BULBS AND TUBERS\r\n\r\n_(See the particular culture of the different kinds in Chapter VIII;\r\nand instructions for forcing on *p. 345.)_\r\n\r\nIt is customary to write of bulbs and tubers together, because the tops\r\nand flowers of all the bulbous and tuberous plants spring from large\r\nreservoirs of stored food, giving rise to similar methods of culture\r\nand of storage.\r\n\r\nStructurally, the bulb is very different from the tuber, however. A\r\nbulb is practically a large dormant bud, the scales representing the\r\nleaves, and the embryo stem lying in the center. Bulbs are condensed\r\nplants in storage. The tuber, on the other hand, is a solid body, with\r\nbuds arising from it. Some tubers represent thickened stems, as the\r\nIrish potato, and some thickened roots, as probably the sweet-potato,\r\nand some both stem and root, as the turnip, parsnip, and beet. Some\r\ntubers are very bulb-like in appearance, as the corms of crocus and\r\ngladiolus.\r\n\r\nUsing the word “bulb” in the gardener’s sense to include all these\r\nplants as a cultural group, we may throw them into two classes: the\r\nhardy kinds, to be planted in fall; and the tender kinds, to be planted\r\nin spring.\r\n\r\n_Fall-planted bulbs_.\r\n\r\nThe fall-planted bulbs are of two groups: the “Holland bulbs” or early\r\nspring bloomers, as crocus, tulip (Fig. 255), hyacinth (Fig. 262),\r\nnarcissus (Fig. 260), squill (Fig. 256), snowdrop; the summer bloomers,\r\nas lilies (Figs. 258, 259). The treatments of the two groups are so\r\nsimilar that they may be discussed together.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig: 255. Tulips, the warmest of spring flowers.]\r\n\r\nAll these bulbs may be planted as soon as they are mature; but in\r\npractice they are kept till late September or October before they are\r\nput into the ground, as nothing is gained by earlier planting, and,\r\nmoreover, the ground is usually not ready to receive them until some\r\nother crop is removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 256. One of the squills.--_Scilla bifolia_.]\r\n\r\nThese bulbs are planted in the fall (1) because they keep better in the\r\nground than when stored; (2) because they will take root in fall and\r\nwinter and be ready for the first warmth of spring; (3) and because it\r\nis usually impossible to get on the ground early enough in spring to\r\nplant them with much hope of success for that season.\r\n\r\nThe bulbs lie dormant until spring, so far as outward appearances go;\r\nthey are mulched to insure that they will not start in warm weather of\r\nfall or winter, and to protect the ground from heaving.\r\n\r\nTo secure good bulbs and of the desired varieties, the order should be\r\nplaced in spring or early summer. For flower-garden effects, the large\r\nand mature bulbs should be secured; for colonizing in shrubbery or on\r\nthe lawn, the smaller sizes may be sufficient. Insist that your bulbs\r\nshall be first class, for there is wide difference in the quality; even\r\nwith the best of treatment, good results cannot be secured from poor\r\nbulbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 257. A purple-flowered Amaryllis.--_Lycoris\r\nsquamigera_, but known as _Amaryllis Hallii_.]\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that there are autumn-flowering bulbs.\r\nSeveral species of crocus bloom in the fall, _C. sativus_ (the saffron\r\ncrocus) and _C. speciosus_ being the ones generally recommended. The\r\ncolchicums are excellent autumn-blooming bulbs and should be more\r\ngenerally planted. _C. autumnale_, rosy purple, is the usual species.\r\nThese autumn-blooming bulbs are planted in August or early September\r\nand treated in general the same as other similar bulbs. The colchicums\r\nusually remain in the ground several years in good condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 258. The Japanese gold-banded lily.--_Lilium\r\nauratum_]\r\n\r\nAll kinds of bulbs are partial to a deep, rich, water-free soil. This\r\nis no small part of their successful culture. The spot should be well\r\ndrained, either naturally or artificially. In flattish and rather moist\r\nlands the beds may be made above the surface, some 18 inches high, and\r\nbordered with grass. A layer of rough stones a foot deep is sometimes\r\nused in the bottom of ordinary beds for drainage, and with good\r\nresults, when other methods are not convenient, and when there is fear\r\nthat the bed may become too wet. If the place is likely to be rather\r\nwet, place a large handful of sand where the bulb is to go and set the\r\nbulb on it. This will keep the water from standing around the bulb.\r\nVery good results may be had in heavy soil by this method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 259. One of the common wild lilies.--_Lilium\r\nPhiladelphicum_.]\r\n\r\nThe soil for bulbs should be well enriched with old manure. Fresh\r\nmanure should never be allowed close about the bulb. The addition of\r\nleafmold and a little sand also improves the texture of heavy soils.\r\nFor lilies the leafmold may be omitted. Let the spading be at least a\r\nfoot deep. Eighteen inches will be none too deep for lilies. To make a\r\nbulb bed, throw out the top earth to the depth of 6 inches. Put into\r\nthe bottom of the bed about 2 inches of well-rotted manure and spade it\r\ninto the soil. Throw back half of the top soil, level it off nicely,\r\nset the bulbs firmly on this bed, and then cover them with the\r\nremainder of the earth; in this way one will have the bulbs from 3 to 4\r\ninches below the surface, and they will all be of uniform depth and\r\nwill give uniform results if the bulbs themselves are well graded. The\r\n“design” bed may be worked out easily in this way, for all the bulbs\r\nare fully exposed after they are placed, and they are all covered at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 260. Common species of narcissus.--_a a. Narcissus\r\nPseudo-Narcissus_ or daffodil; _b._ Jonquil; _c. N. Pœticus_.]\r\n\r\nOf course, it is not necessary that the home gardener go to the trouble\r\nof removing the earth and replacing it if he merely wants good blooms;\r\nbut if he wants a good bed as a whole, or a mass effect, he should take\r\nthis pains. In the shrubberies and on the lawn he may “stick them in”\r\nhere and there, seeing that the top of the bulb is 3 to 6 inches\r\nbeneath the surface, the depth depending on the size of the bulb (the\r\nbigger and stronger the bulb, the deeper it may go) and on the nature\r\nof the soil (they may go deeper in sand than in hard clay).\r\n\r\nAs the time of severe winter freezing approaches, the bed should\r\nreceive a mulch of leaves, manure or litter, to the depth of 4 inches\r\nor more, according to the latitude and the kind of material. If leaves\r\nare used, 3 inches will be enough, because the leaves lie close\r\ntogether and may smother out the frost that is in the ground and let\r\nthe bulbs start. It will be well to let the mulch extend 1 foot or more\r\nbeyond the margins of the bed. When cold weather is past, half of the\r\nmulch should be removed. The remainder may be left on till there is no\r\nlonger danger of frost. On removing the last of the mulch, lightly work\r\nover the surface among the bulbs with a thrust-hoe.\r\n\r\nIf the weather happens to be very bright during the blooming season,\r\nthe duration of the flowers may be prolonged by light shading—as with\r\nmuslin, or slats placed above the beds. If planted where they have\r\npartial shade from surrounding trees or shrubbery, the beds will not\r\nneed attention of this kind.\r\n\r\nLilies may remain undisturbed for years. Crocuses and tulips may stand\r\ntwo years, but hyacinths should be taken up each year and replanted;\r\ntulips also will be better for the same treatment. Narcissus may remain\r\nfor some years, or until they show signs of running out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 261. The Belladonna lily.--_Amaryllis Belladonna_.]\r\n\r\nBulbs that are to be taken up should be left in the ground till the\r\nfoliage turns yellow, or dies down naturally. This gives the bulbs a\r\nchance to ripen. Cutting off the foliage and digging too early is a not\r\nuncommon and serious mistake. Bulbs that have been planted in places\r\nthat are wanted for summer bedding plants may be dug with the foliage\r\non and heeled-in under a tree, or along a fence, to stand till ripened.\r\nThe plant should be injured as little as possible, as the foliage of\r\nthis year makes the flowers of the next. When the foliage has turned\r\nyellow or died down, the bulbs—after cleaning, and curing them for a\r\nfew hours in the sun—may be stored in the cellar or other cool, dry\r\nplace, to await fall planting. Bulbs that are lifted prematurely in\r\nthis way should be planted permanently in the borders, for they will\r\nnot make good flower-garden subjects the following year. In fact, it is\r\nusually best to buy fresh, strong bulbs each year of tulips, hyacinths,\r\nand crocuses if the best results are desired, using the old bulbs for\r\nshrubberies and mixed borders.\r\n\r\nCrocuses and squills are often planted in the lawn. It is not to be\r\nexpected that they will last more than two to three years, however,\r\neven if care is taken not to cut the tops closely when the lawn is cut.\r\nThe narcissus (including daffodils and jonquils) will remain in good\r\ncondition for years in grassy parts of the place, if the tops are\r\nallowed to mature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 262. The common Dutch hyacinth.]\r\n\r\n_List of outdoor fall-planted bulbs for the North_.\r\n\r\nCrocus.\r\nHyacinth.\r\nTulip.\r\nNarcissus (including daffodil and jonquil).\r\nScilla, or squill.\r\nSnowdrop _(Galanthus)._\r\nSnowflake _(Leucoium)._\r\nChionodoxa.\r\nHardy alliums.\r\nBulbocodium.\r\nCamassia.\r\nLily-of-the-valley.\r\nWinter aconite (_Eranthis hycmalis_).\r\nDog-tooth violets (_Erythronium_).\r\nCrown imperial (_Fritillaria Imperialis_).\r\nFritillary (_Fritillaria Mekagris_).\r\nTrilliums.\r\nLilies.\r\n\r\nPeonies, tuberous anemones, tuberous buttercups, iris, bleeding heart,\r\nand the like, may be planted in autumn and are often classed with\r\nfall-planted bulbs.\r\n\r\n_Winter bulbs_ (p. 345).\r\n\r\nSome of these bulbs may be made to bloom in the greenhouse,\r\nwindow-garden, or living room in winter. Hyacinths are particularly\r\nuseful for this purpose, because the bloom is less affected by cloudy\r\nweather than that of tulips and crocuses. Some kinds of narcissus also\r\n“force” well, particularly the daffodil; and the Paper-white and\r\n“Chinese sacred lily” are practically the only common bulbs from which\r\nthe home gardener may expect good bloom before Christmas. The method of\r\nhandling bulbs for winter bloom is described under Window-gardening (on\r\n*p. 345).\r\n\r\n_Summer bulbs_.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing special to be said of the culture of the so-called\r\nsummer-blooming and spring-planted bulbs, as a class. They are tender,\r\nand are therefore planted after cold weather is past. For early bloom,\r\nthey may be started indoors. Of course, any list of spring-planted\r\nbulbs is relative to the climate, for what may be planted in spring in\r\nNew York perhaps may be planted in the fall in Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe common “summer bulbs” are:—\r\n\r\nGladiolus\r\nTuberose\r\nDahlia\r\nCanna\r\nArum\r\nCalla\r\nCalochortus\r\nAlstremeria\r\nAmaryllis\r\nColocasia\r\n\r\n\r\n5. THE SHRUBBERY\r\n\r\n(Exclusive of coniferous evergreens and climbing plants.)\r\n\r\nThe common hardy shrubs or bushes may be planted in fall or spring. In\r\nthe northernmost parts of the country and in Canada spring planting is\r\nusually safer, although on well-drained ground and when thoroughly\r\nmulched the plants may even there do well if planted as soon as the\r\nleaves drop in fall. If the shrubs are purchased in spring, they are\r\nlikely to have come from “cellared stock”; that is, the nurserymen dig\r\nmuch of their stock in fall and store it in cellars built for the\r\npurpose. While stock that is properly cellared is perfectly reliable,\r\nthat which has been allowed to get too dry or which has been otherwise\r\nimproperly handled comes on very slowly in the spring, makes a poor\r\ngrowth the first year, and much of it may die.\r\n\r\nIn the planting of any kind of trees or shrubs, it is well to remember\r\nthat nursery-grown specimens generally transplant more readily and\r\nthrive better than trees taken from the wild; and this is particularly\r\ntrue if the stock was transplanted in the nursery. Trees that\r\ntransplant with difficulty, as the papaw or asimina, and some nut\r\ntrees, may be prepared for removal by cutting some of their roots—and\r\nespecially the tap-root, if they have such—a year or two in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. The pageant of summer. XIII. The pageant of summer. Gardens of C.\r\nW. Dowdeswell, England, from a painting by Miss Parsons. For permission\r\nto reproduce the above picture we are indebted to the kindness of\r\nMessrs. Sutton & Sons, Seed Merchants, Reading, England, the owners of\r\nthe copyright, who published it in their Amateur’s Guide in\r\nHorticulture for 1909.\r\n\r\nIt is ordinarily best to plow or spade the entire area in which the\r\nshrubs are to be set. For a year or two the ground should be tilled\r\nbetween the shrubs, either by horse tools or by hoes and rakes. If the\r\nplace looks bare, seeds of quick-growing flowers may be scattered about\r\nthe edges of the mass, or herbaceous perennials may be used.\r\n\r\nThe larger shrubs, as lilacs and syringas, may be set about 4 feet\r\napart; but the smaller ones should be set about 2 feet apart if it is\r\ndesired to secure an immediate effect. If after a few years the mass\r\nbecomes too crowded, some of the specimens may be removed (*p. 76).\r\n\r\nThrow the shrubs into an irregular plantation, not in rows, and make\r\nthe inner edge of the mass more or less undulating and broken.\r\n\r\nIt is a good practice to mulch the plantation each fall with light\r\nmanure, leaf mold, or other material. Even though the shrubs are\r\nperfectly hardy, this mulch greatly improves the land and promotes\r\ngrowth. After the shrub borders have become two or three years old, the\r\ndrifting leaves of fall will be caught therein and will be held as a\r\nmulch (p. 82).\r\n\r\nWhen the shrubs are first planted, they are headed back one half or\r\nmore (Fig. 45); but after they are established they are not to be\r\nsheared, but allowed to take their own way, and after a few years the\r\noutermost ones will droop and meet the green*-sward (*pp. 25, 26).\r\n\r\nMany rapid-growing trees may be utilized as shrubs by cutting them off\r\nnear the ground every year, or every other year, and allowing young\r\nshoots to grow. Basswood, black ash, some of the maples, tulip tree,\r\nmulberry, ailanthus, paulownia, magnolias, _Acer campestre_, and others\r\nmay be treated in this way (Fig. 50).\r\n\r\nNearly all shrubs bloom in spring or early summer. If kinds blooming\r\nlate in summer or in fall are desired, they maybe looked for in\r\nbaccharis, caryopteris, cephalanthus, clethra, hamamelis, hibiscus,\r\nhydrangea, hypericum, lespedeza, rhus _(R. Cotinus), Sambucus\r\nCanadensis_ in midsummer, tamarisk.\r\n\r\nPlants that bloom in very early spring (not mentioning such as birches,\r\nalders, and hazels) may be found in amelanchier, cydonia, daphne,\r\ndirca, forsythia, cercis (in tree list), benzoin, lonicera _(L.\r\nfragrantissima_), salix (_S. discolor_ and other pussy willows),\r\nshepherdia.\r\n\r\nShrubs bearing conspicuous berries, pods, and the like, that persist in\r\nfall or winter may be found in the genera berberis (particularly _B.\r\nThunbergii_), colutea, corylus, cratægus, euonymus, ilex, physocarpus,\r\nostrya, ptelea, pyracantha (Plate XIX) pyrus, rhodotypos, rosa (_R.\r\nrugosa_), staphylea, symphoricarpus, viburnum, xanthoceras.\r\n\r\n_List of shrubbery plants for the North_.\r\n\r\nThe following list of shrubs (of course not complete) comprises a\r\nselection with particular reference to southern Michigan and central\r\nNew York, where the mercury sometimes falls to fifteen degrees below\r\nzero. Application is also made to Canada by designating species that\r\nhave been found to be hardy at Ottawa.\r\n\r\nThe list is arranged alphabetically by the names of the genera.\r\n\r\nThe * denotes that the plant is native to North America.\r\n\r\nThe ‡ indicates species that are recommended by the Central\r\nExperimental Farms, Ottawa, Ontario.\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult to determine whether a group should be listed\r\namong shrubs or trees. Sometimes the plant is not quite a tree and is\r\nyet something more than a shrub or bush; sometimes the plant may be\r\ndistinctly a tree in its southern range and a shrub in its northern\r\nrange; sometimes the same genus or group contains both shrubs and\r\ntrees. In the following genera there are doubtful cases: æsculus,\r\nalnus, amelanchier, betula, caragana, castanea, cornus (_C. florida_),\r\ncratægus, elæagnus, prunus, robinia.\r\n\r\nDwarf buckeye, _Æsculus parviflora (Pavia macrostachya_).* Attractive\r\nin habit, foliage, and flower; produces a large foliage mass.\r\n\r\nAlder.

Rosa rugosa.]\r\n\r\nHardy roses are not always desirable for the lawn. For general lawn\r\npurposes the older sorts, single or semi-double, and which do not\r\nrequire high culture, are to be preferred. It is not intended to\r\ninclude here the common garden roses; see Chapter VIII for these. It is\r\nmuch to be desired that the wild roses receive more attention from\r\nplanters. Attention has been too exclusively taken by the highly\r\nimproved garden roses.\r\n\r\nJapanese rose, _Rosa rugosa_.‡\r\n\r\nMost excellent for lawn planting, as the foliage is thick and not\r\nattacked by insects (Fig. 263); white and pink flowered forms; 4-6 ft.\r\n\r\nWild swamp rose, _R. Carolina_.* 5-8 ft.\r\n\r\nWild dwarf rose, _R. humilis_* (_R. lucida_ of Michigan).

Many of the native willows might well be\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nElders, _Sambucus pubens_* and _S. Canadensis_.* The former, the common\r\n“red elder,” is ornamental both in flower and fruit. _S. Canadensis_ is\r\ndesirable for its profusion of fragrant flowers appearing in July; the\r\nformer is 6–7 ft. high and the latter 8-10 ft. Golden-leaved elder, _S.\r\nnigra_ var. _foliis aureis_,‡ and also the cut-leaved elder, are\r\ndesirable forms of the European species; 5-15 ft.\r\n\r\nBuffalo-berry, _Shepherdia argentea_* Silvery foliage; attractive and\r\nedible berries; 10-15 ft., often tree-like.\r\n\r\nShepherdia, _S. Canadensis_.* Spreading bush, 3–8 ft., with attractive\r\nfoliage and fruit.\r\n\r\nEarly spirea, _Spiræa arguta_.‡ One of the earliest bloomers among the\r\nspireas; 2-4 ft.\r\n\r\nThree-lobed spirea, bridal wreath, _S.

CLIMBING PLANTS\r\n\r\nVines do not differ particularly in their culture from other herbs and\r\nshrubs, except as they require that supports be provided; and, as they\r\novertop other plants, they demand little room on the ground, and they\r\nmay therefore be grown in narrow or unused spaces along fences and\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the modes of climbing, vines may be thrown into three\r\ngroups,—those that twine about the support; those that climb by means\r\nof special organs, as tendrils, roots, leaf*stalks; those that neither\r\ntwine nor have special organs but that scramble over the support, as\r\nthe climbing roses and the brambles. One must recognize the mode of\r\nclimbing before undertaking the cultivation of any vine.\r\n\r\nVines may also be grouped into annuals, both tender (as morning-glory)\r\nand hardy (as sweet pea); biennials, as adlumia, which are treated\r\npractically as annuals, being sown each year for bloom the next year;\r\nherbaceous perennials, the tops dying each fall down to a persisting\r\nroot, as cinnamon vine and madeira vine; woody perennials (shrubs), the\r\ntops remaining alive, as Virginia creeper, grape, and wistaria.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a garden in which climbing plants may not be used to\r\nadvantage. Sometimes it may be to conceal obtrusive objects, again to\r\nrelieve the monotony of rigid lines. They may also be used to run over\r\nthe ground and to conceal its nakedness where other plants could not\r\nsucceed. The shrubby kinds are often useful about the borders of clumps\r\nof trees and shrubbery, to slope the foliage down to the grass, and to\r\nsoften or erase lines in the landscape.\r\n\r\nIn the South and in California, great use is made of vines, not only on\r\nfences but on houses and arbors. In warm countries, vines give\r\ncharacter to bungalows, pergolas, and other individual forms of\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired that the vines climb high, the soil should be fertile;\r\nbut high climbing in annual plants (as in sweet peas) may be at the\r\nexpense of bloom.\r\n\r\nThe use of vines for screens and pillar decorations has increased in\r\nrecent years until now they may be seen in nearly all grounds. The\r\ntendency has been towards using the hardy vines, of which the\r\nampelopsis, or Virginia creeper, is one of the most common. This is a\r\nvery rapid grower, and lends itself to training more readily than many\r\nothers. The Japan ampelopsis (_A. tricuspidata_ or _Veitchii_) is a\r\ngood clinging vine, growing very rapidly when once established, and\r\nbrilliantly colored after the first fall frosts. It clings closer than\r\nthe other, but is not so hardy. Either of these may be grown from\r\ncuttings or division of the plants.\r\n\r\nTwo recommendable woody twiners of recent distribution are the\r\nactinidia and the akebia, both from Japan. They are perfectly hardy,\r\nand are rapid growers. The former has large thick glossy leaves, not\r\naffected by insects or disease, growing thickly along the stem and\r\nbranches, making a perfect thatch. It blooms in June. The flowers,\r\nwhich are white with a purple center, are borne in clusters, followed\r\nby round or longish edible fruits. The akebia has very neat-cut\r\nfoliage, quaint purple flowers, and often bears ornamental fruit.\r\n\r\nOf the tender vines, the nasturtiums and ipomeas and morning-glories\r\nare the most common in the North, while the adlumia, balloon vine,\r\npassion vine, gourds, and others, are frequently used. One of the best\r\nof recent introduction is the annual hop, especially the variegated\r\nvariety. This is a very rapid-growing vine, seeding itself each year,\r\nand needing little care. The climbing geraniums (_Pelargonium peltatum_\r\nand its derivatives) are much used in California. All the tender vines\r\nshould be planted after danger of frost is past.\r\n\r\nSo many good vines are now on the market that one may grow a wide\r\nvariety for many uses. The home gardener should keep his eyes open for\r\nthe wild vines of his neighborhood and add the best of them to his\r\ncollection. Most of these natives are worthy of cultivation. Even the\r\npoison ivy makes a very satisfactory cover for rough and inaccessible\r\nplaces in the wild, and its autumn color is very attractive; but of\r\ncourse its cultivation cannot be recommended.\r\n\r\nVines that cling closely to walls of buildings are Virginia creeper\r\n(one form does not cling well), Boston or Japanese ivy _(Ampelopsis\r\ntricuspidata_; also _A. Lowii_, with smaller foliage), English ivy,\r\neuonymus _(E. radicans_ and the var. _variegata_), and _Ficus repens_\r\nfar south; others that cling less closely are trumpet creeper, and\r\nclimbing hydrangea _(Schizophragma hydrangeoides)._\r\n\r\nVines for trailing, or covering the ground, are periwinkle _(Vinca),_\r\nherniaria, moneywort _(Lysimachia nummularia_), ground-ivy _(Nepeta\r\nGlechoma), Rosa Wichuraiana_, species of native greenbrier or smilax\r\n(not the so-called smilax of florists), _Rubus laciniatus_, dewberries,\r\nand also others that usually are not classed as vines. In the South,\r\nJapanese honeysuckle and Cherokee rose perform this function\r\nextensively. In California, species of mesembryanthemum (herbaceous)\r\nare extensively used as ground covers on banks. Page 86.\r\n\r\nFor quickly covering brush and rough places, the many kinds of gourds\r\nmay be used; also pumpkins and squashes, watermelons, _Cucumis\r\nfœtidissima_, wild cucumbers _(Echinocystis lobata_ and _Sicyos\r\nangulata_), nasturtiums, and other vigorous annuals. Many of the woody\r\nperennials may be used for such purposes, but usually these places are\r\nonly temporary.\r\n\r\nFor arbors, strong woody vines are desired. Grapes are excellent; in\r\nthe South the muscadine and scuppernong grapes are adaptable to this\r\npurpose (Plate XV). Actinidia and wistaria are also used. Akebia,\r\ndutchman’s pipe, trumpet creeper, clematis, honeysuckles, may be\r\nsuggested. Roses are much used in warm climates.\r\n\r\nFor covering porches, the standard vine in the North is Virginia\r\ncreeper. Grapes are admirable, particularly some of the wild ones.\r\nJapan honeysuckle is much used; and it has the advantage of holding its\r\nfoliage well into the winter, or even all winter southward. Actinidia,\r\nakebia, wistaria, roses, dutch-man’s pipe, and clematis are to be\r\nrecommended; the large-flowered clematises, however, are more valuable\r\nfor their bloom than for their foliage (_C. paniculata_, and the native\r\nspecies are better for covering porches).\r\n\r\nThe annual vines are mostly used as flower-garden subjects, as the\r\nsweet pea, morning-glories, mina, moonflowers, cypress vine,\r\nnasturtiums, cobea, scarlet runner. Several species of convolvulus,\r\nclosely allied to the common morning-glory, have now enriched our\r\nlists. For baskets and vases the maurandia and the different kinds of\r\nthunbergias are excellent.\r\n\r\nThe moonflowers are very popular in the South, where the seasons are\r\nlong enough to allow them to develop to perfection. In the North they\r\nmust be started early (it is a good plan to soak or notch the seeds)\r\nand be given a warm exposure and good soil (see in Chap. VIII).\r\n\r\nIn the following lists, the plants native to the United States or\r\nCanada are marked by an asterisk *.\r\n\r\n_Annual herbaceous climbers_.\r\n(Grown each year from seed.)\r\n\r\n_a.

Climbing rose, Jules Margottin.]\r\n\r\nThe roses do not climb nor possess any special climbing organs;\r\ntherefore they must be provided with a trellis or woven-wire fence.\r\nSome of the roses classed as climbing are such as only need good\r\nsupport, Fig. 267. For culture of roses, see Chapter VIII.\r\n\r\nThe most popular climbing or pillar rose at present is Crimson Rambler,\r\nbut while it makes a great display of flowers, it is not the best\r\nclimbing rose. Probably the best of the real climbing roses for this\r\ncountry, bloom, foliage, and habit all considered, are the derivatives\r\nof the native prairie rose, _Rosa setigera_ (native as far north as\r\nOntario and Wisconsin). Baltimore Belle and Queen of the Prairie belong\r\nto this class.\r\n\r\nThe climbing polyantha roses (hybrids of _Rosa multiflora_ and other\r\nspecies) include the class of “rambler” roses that has now come to be\r\nlarge, including not only the Crimson Rambler, but forms of other\r\ncolors, single and semi-double, and various climbing habits; a very\r\nvaluable and hardy class of roses, particularly for trellises.\r\n\r\nThe Memorial rose _(R. Wichuraiana_) is a trailing, half-evergreen,\r\nwhite-flowered species, very useful for covering banks and rocks.\r\nDerivatives of this species of many kinds are now available, and are\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nThe Ayrshire roses _(R. arvensis_ var. _capreolata_) are profuse but\r\nrather slender growers, hardy North, bearing double white or pink\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokee rose _(R. Icevigata_ or _R. Sinica_) is extensively\r\nnaturalized in the South, and much prized for its large white bloom and\r\nshining foliage; not hardy in the North.\r\n\r\nThe Banksia rose _(R. Banksice_) is a strong climbing rose for the\r\nSouth and California with yellow or white flowers in clusters. A\r\nlarger-flowered form _(R. Fortuneana_) is a hybrid of this and the\r\nCherokee rose.\r\n\r\nThe climbing tea and noisette roses, forms of _R. Chinensis_ and _R.\r\nNoisettiana_, are useful in the open in the South.\r\n\r\n7. TREES FOR LAWNS AND STREETS\r\n\r\nA single tree may give character to an entire home property; and a\r\nplace of any size that does not have at least one good tree usually\r\nlacks any dominating landscape note.\r\n\r\nLikewise, a street that is devoid of good trees cannot be the best\r\nresidential section; and a park that lacks well-grown trees is either\r\nimmature or barren.\r\n\r\nAlthough the list of good and hardy lawn and street trees is rather\r\nextensive, the number of kinds generally planted and recognized is\r\nsmall. Since most home places can have but few trees, and since they\r\nrequire so many years to mature, it is natural that the home-maker\r\nshould hesitate about experimenting, or trying kinds that he does not\r\nhimself know. So the home-maker in the North plants maples, elms, and a\r\nwhite birch, and in the South a magnolia and China-berry. Yet there are\r\nnumbers of trees as useful as these, the planting of which might give\r\nour premises and streets a much richer expression.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be desired that some of the trees with “strong” and\r\nrugged characters be introduced into the larger grounds; such, for\r\nexample, as the hickories and oaks. These may often transplant with\r\ndifficulty, but the effort to secure them is worth the expenditure.\r\nGood trees of oaks, and others supposed to be difficult to transplant,\r\nmay now be had of the leading nurserymen. The pin oak _(Quercus\r\npalustris_) is one of the best street trees and is now largely planted.\r\n\r\nIt is at least possible to introduce a variety of trees into a city or\r\nvillage, by devoting one street or a series of blocks to a single kind\r\nof tree,—one street being known by its lindens, one by its plane-trees,\r\none by its oaks, one by its hickories, one by its native birches,\r\nbeech, coffee-tree, sassafras, gum or liquidambar, tulip tree, and the\r\nlike. There is every reason why a city, particularly a small city or a\r\nvillage, should become to some extent an artistic expression of its\r\nnatural region.\r\n\r\nThe home-maker is fortunate if his area already possesses well-grown\r\nlarge trees. It may even be desirable to place the residence with\r\nreference to such trees (Plate VI); and the planning of the grounds\r\nshould accept them as fixed points to which to work. The operator will\r\ntake every care to preserve and safeguard sufficient of the standing\r\ntrees to give the place singularity and character.\r\n\r\nThe care of the tree should include not only the protecting of it from\r\nenemies and accidents, but also the maintaining of its characteristic\r\nfeatures. For example, the natural rough bark should be maintained\r\nagainst the raids of tree-scrapers; and the grading should not be\r\nallowed to disguise the natural bulge of the tree at the base, for a\r\ntree that is covered a foot or two above the natural line is not only\r\nin danger of being killed, but it looks like a post.\r\n\r\nThe best shade trees are usually those that are native to the\r\nparticular region, since they are hardy and adapted to the soil and\r\nother conditions. Elms, maples, basswoods, and the like are nearly\r\nalways reliable. In regions in which there are serious insect enemies\r\nor fungous diseases, the trees that are most likely to be attacked may\r\nbe omitted. For instance, in parts of the East the chestnut\r\nbark-disease is a very great menace; and it is a good plan in such\r\nplaces to plant other trees than chestnuts.\r\n\r\nA good shade tree is one that has a heavy foliage and dense head, and\r\nthat is not commonly attacked by repelling insects and diseases. Trees\r\nfor shade should ordinarily be given sufficient room that they may\r\ndevelop into full size and symmetrical heads. Trees may be planted as\r\nclose as 10 or 15 feet apart for temporary effect; but as soon as they\r\nbegin to crowd they should be thinned, so that they develop their full\r\ncharacteristics as trees.\r\n\r\nTrees may be planted in fall or spring. Fall is desirable, except for\r\nthe extreme North, if the land is well drained and prepared and if the\r\ntrees may be got in early; but under usual conditions, spring planting\r\nis safer, if the stock has been wintered well (see discussion under\r\nShrubs, p. 290). Planting and pruning are discussed on pp. 124 and 139.\r\n\r\nIf one desires trees with conspicuous bloom, they should be found among\r\nthe magnolias, tulip trees, kœlreuteria, catalpas, chestnuts,\r\nhorse-chestnut and buckeyes, cladrastis, black or yellow locust, wild\r\nblack cherry, and less conspicuously in the lindens; and also in such\r\nhalf-trees or big shrubs as cercis, cytisus, flowering dogwood,\r\ndouble-flowered and other forms of apples, crab-apples, cherries,\r\nplums, peaches, hawthorn or cratægus, amelanchier, mountain ash.\r\n\r\nAmong drooping or weeping trees the best may be found in the willows\r\n_(Salix Babylonica_ and others), maples (Wier’s), birch, mulberry,\r\nbeech, ash, elm, cherry, poplar, mountain ash.\r\n\r\nPurple-leaved varieties occur in the beech, maple, elm, oak, birch, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nYellow-leaved and tricolors occur in the maple, oak, poplar, elm,\r\nbeech, and other species.\r\n\r\nCut-leaved forms are found in birch, beech, maple, alder, oak,\r\nbasswood, and others.\r\n\r\n_List of hardy deciduous trees for the North_.\r\n\r\n(The genera are arranged alphabetically. Natives are marked by *; good\r\nspecies for shade trees by †; those recommended by the Experiment\r\nStation at Ottawa, Ontario, by DD)\r\n\r\nIn a number of the genera, the plants may be shrubby rather than\r\narboreus in some regions (see the Shrub list), as in acer _(A. Ginnala,\r\nA. spicatum_), æsculus, betula _(B. pumila_), carpinus, castanea (_C.\r\npumila_), catalpa _(C. ovata_), cercis, magnolia (_M. glauca_\r\nparticularly), ostrya, prunus, pyrus, salix, sorbus.\r\n\r\nNorway maple, _Acer platanoides_.(D, DD) One of the finest medium-sized\r\ntrees for single lawn specimens; there are several horticultural\r\nvarieties. Var. _Schwedleri_‡ is one of the best of purple-leaved\r\ntrees. The Norway maple droops too much and is too low-headed for\r\nroadside planting.\r\n\r\nBlack sugar maple, _A. nigrum_.(A, DD) Darker and softer in aspect than\r\nthe ordinary sugar maple.\r\n\r\nSugar maple, _A. saccharum_.(A, DD) This and the last are among the\r\nvery best roadside trees.\r\n\r\nSilver maple, _A. saccharinum (A. dasycarpum_).(A, DD) Desirable for\r\nwater-courses and for grouping; succeeds on both wet and dry lands.\r\n\r\nWier’s cut-leaved silver maple, _A. saccharinum_ var. _Wieri_.(D, DD)\r\n\r\nLight and graceful; especially desirable for pleasure grounds.\r\n\r\nRed, soft, or swamp maple, _A. rubrum_.* Valuable for its spring and\r\nautumn colors, and for variety in grouping.\r\n\r\nSycamore maple, _A. Pseudo-platanus._ A slow grower, to be used mostly\r\nas single specimens. Several horticultural varieties.\r\n\r\nEnglish maple, _A. campestre_. A good medium-sized tree of slow growth,\r\nnot hardy on our northern borders; see under Shrubs (p. 291).\r\n\r\nJapan maple, _A. palmatum (A. polymorphum)_. In many forms, useful for\r\nsmall lawn specimens; does not grow above 10-20 ft.\r\n\r\nSiberian maple, _A. Ginnala_.‡ Attractive as a lawn specimen when grown\r\nas a bush; the autumn color is very bright; small tree or big shrub.\r\n\r\nMountain maple, _A. spicatum_.* Very bright in autumn.\r\n\r\nBox-elder, _Acer Negundo (Negundo aceroides_ or _fraxinifolium_).*†\r\nVery hardy and rapid growing; much used in the West as a windbreak, but\r\nnot strong in ornamental features.\r\n\r\nHorse chestnut, _Æsculus Hippocastanum_.†‡ Useful for single specimens\r\nand roadsides; many forms.\r\n\r\nBuckeye, _Æ. octandra (Æ. flava)_*‡\r\n\r\nOhio buckeye, _Æ. glabra_*\r\n\r\nRed buckeye, _Æ. cornea (Æ. rubicunda)_.\r\n\r\nAilanthus, _Ailanthus glandulosa_. A rapid grower, with large pinnate\r\nleaves; the staminate plant possesses a disagreeable odor when it\r\nflowers; suckers badly; most useful as a shrub; see the same under\r\nShrubs (also Fig. 50).\r\n\r\nAlder, _Alnus glutinosa_. The var. _imperialis_‡ is one of the best\r\ncut-leaved small trees.\r\n\r\nEuropean birch, _Betula alba_.\r\n\r\nCut-leaved weeping birch, _B. alba_ var. _laciniata pendula_.‡\r\n\r\nAmerican white birch, _B. populifolia_.*\r\n\r\nPaper, or canoe birch, _B. papyrifera_.*\r\n\r\nCherry birch, _B. lenta_. *\r\n\r\nWell-grown specimens resemble the sweet cherry; both this and the\r\nyellow birch (_B. lutea_*) make attractive light-leaved trees; they are\r\nnot appreciated.\r\n\r\nHornbeam or blue beech, _Carpinus Americana_.* Chestnut, _Castanea\r\nsaliva_† and _C. Americana_.*†\r\n\r\nShowy catalpa, _Catalpa speciosa_.†‡ Very dark, soft-foliaged tree of\r\nsmall to medium size; showy in flower; for northern regions should be\r\nraised from northern-grown seed.\r\n\r\nSmaller catalpa, _C. bignonioides_.† Less showy than the last, blooming\r\na week or two later; less hardy.\r\n\r\nJapanese catalpa, _C. ovata_ (_C. Kœmpferi_).‡ In northern sections\r\noften remains practically a bush.\r\n\r\nNettle-tree, _Celtis occidentalis_.*\r\n\r\nKatsura-tree, _Cercidiphyllum Japonicum_.‡ A small or medium-sized tree\r\nof very attractive foliage and habit.\r\n\r\nRed-bud, or Judas-tree, _Cercis Canadensis_.* Produces a profusion of\r\nrose-purple pea-like flowers before the leaves appear; foliage also\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nYellow-wood, or virgilia, _Cladrastis tinctoria_.* One of the finest\r\nhardy flowering trees.\r\n\r\nBeech, _Fagus ferruginea_.*† Specimens which are symmetrically\r\ndeveloped are among our best lawn trees; picturesque in winter.\r\n\r\nEuropean beech, _F. sylvatica_.† Many cultural forms, the purple-leaved\r\nbeing everywhere known. There are excellent tricolored varieties and\r\nweeping forms.\r\n\r\nBlack ash, _Fraxinus nigra_ (_F. sambucifolia_).*† One of the best of\r\nthe light-leaved trees; does well on dry soils, although native to\r\nswamps; not appreciated.\r\n\r\nWhite ash, _F. Americana_.*†\r\n\r\nEuropean ash, _F. excelsior_.† There is a good weeping form of this.\r\n\r\nMaiden-hair tree, _Ginkgo biloba_ (_Salisburia adiantifolia_).‡ Very\r\nodd and striking; to be used for single specimens or avenues.\r\n\r\nHoney locust, _Gleditschia triacanthos_.*† Tree of striking habit, with\r\nbig branching thorns and very large pods; there is also a thornless\r\nform.\r\n\r\nKentucky coffee-tree, _Gymnocladus Canadensis_.* Light and graceful;\r\nunique in winter.\r\n\r\nBitternut, _Hicoria minima_ (or _Carya amara_).* Much like black ash in\r\naspect; not appreciated.\r\n\r\nHickory, _Hicoria ovata_ (or _Carya_) *†‡ and others.\r\n\r\nPecan, _H.

Europœa_).‡\r\n\r\nAmerican larch or tamarack, _L. Americana_.*\r\n\r\nGum-tree, sweet gum, _Liquidambar styraciflua_.*† A good tree, reaching\r\nas far north as Connecticut, and hardy in parts of western New York\r\nalthough not growing large; foliage maple-like; a characteristic tree\r\nof the South.\r\n\r\nTulip tree or whitewood, _Liriodendron Tulipifera_.*† Unique in foliage\r\nand flower and deserving to be more planted.\r\n\r\nCucumber tree, _Magnolia acuminata_.*† Native in the Northern states;\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nWhite bay-tree, _M. glauca_.*† Very attractive small tree, native along\r\nthe coast to Massachusetts; where not hardy, the young growth each year\r\nis good.\r\n\r\nOf the foreign magnolias hardy in the North, two species and one group\r\nof hybrids are prominent: _M. stellata_ (or _M. Halleana_) and _M.\r\nYulan_ or _(M. conspicua),_ both white-flowered, the former very early\r\nand having 9-18 petals and the latter (which is a larger tree) having\r\n6-9 petals; _M. Soulangeana,_ a hybrid group including the forms known\r\nas _Lennei, nigra, Norbertiana, speciosa, grandis_. All these magnolias\r\nare deciduous and bloom before the leaves appear.\r\n\r\nMulberry, _Morus rubra_.*\r\n\r\nWhite mulberry, _M. alba_.\r\n\r\nRussian mulberry, _M. alba_ var. _Tatarica_. Teas’ weeping mulberry is\r\na form of the Russian.\r\n\r\nPepperidge or gum-tree, _Nyssa sylvatica_* One of the oddest and most\r\npicturesque of our native trees; especially attractive in winter;\r\nfoliage brilliant red in autumn; most suitable for low lands.\r\n\r\nIron-wood, hop hornbeam, _Ostrya Virginica_.* A good small tree, with\r\nhop-like fruits.\r\n\r\nSourwood, sorrel-tree, _Oxydendrum arboreum_.* Interesting small tree\r\nnative from Pennsylvania in the high land south, and should be reliable\r\nwhere it grows wild.\r\n\r\nPlane or buttonwood, _Platanus occidentalis_*†‡ Young or middle-aged\r\ntrees are soft and pleasant in aspect, but they soon become thin and\r\nragged below; unique in winter.\r\n\r\nEuropean plane-tree, _P. orientalis_.† Much used for street planting,\r\nbut less picturesque than the American; several forms.\r\n\r\nAspen, _Populus tremuloides_,* Very valuable when well grown; too much\r\nneglected (Fig. 33). Most of the poplars are suitable for pleasure\r\ngrounds, and as nurses for slower growing and more emphatic trees.\r\n\r\nLarge-toothed aspen, _P. grandidentata_.* Unique in summer color;\r\nheavier in aspect than the above; old trees become ragged.\r\n\r\nWeeping poplar, _P. grandidentata_, var. _pendula_. An odd, small tree,\r\nsuitable for small places, but, like all weeping trees, likely to be\r\nplanted too freely.\r\n\r\nCottonwood, _P. deltoides_ (_P. monilifera_).* The staminate specimens,\r\nonly, should be planted if possible, as the cotton of the seed-pods is\r\ndisagreeable when carried by winds; var. _aurea_‡ is one of the good\r\ngolden-leaved trees.\r\n\r\nBalm of Gilead, _P. balsamifera_* and var. _candicans_.* Desirable for\r\nremote groups or belts. Foliage not pleasant in color.\r\n\r\nLombardy poplar, _P. nigra_, var. _Italica_.\r\n\r\nDesirable for certain purposes, but used too indiscriminately, it is\r\nlikely to be short-lived in northern climates.\r\n\r\nWhite poplar, abele, _P. alba_.\r\n\r\nSprouts badly; several forms.\r\n\r\nBolle’s poplar, _P. alba_, var. _Bolleana_.\r\n\r\nHabit much like the Lombardy; leaves curiously lobed, very white\r\nbeneath, making a pleasant contrast.\r\n\r\nCertinensis poplar, _P. laurifolia_ (_P. Certinensis_).\r\n\r\nA very hardy Siberian species, much like _P. deltoides_, useful for\r\nsevere climates.\r\n\r\nWild black cherry, _Prunus serotina_.*\r\n\r\nEuropean bird cherry, _Prunus Padus_.\r\n\r\nA small tree much like the choke cherry, but a freer grower, with\r\nlarger flowers, and racemes which appear about a week later.\r\n\r\nChoke cherry, _P. Virginiana_.*\r\n\r\nVery showy while in flower.\r\n\r\nPurple plum, _Prunus cerasifera_, var. _atropurpurea_ (var.\r\n_Pissardi_).\r\n\r\nOne of our most reliable purple-leaved trees.\r\n\r\nRose-bud cherry, _P. pendula_ (_P. subhirtella_).\r\n\r\nA tree of drooping habit and beautiful rose-pink flowers preceding the\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nJapanese flowering cherry, _P. Pseudo-Cerasus._\r\n\r\nIn many forms, the famous flowering cherries of Japan, but not reliable\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nThere are ornamental-flowered peaches and cherries, more curious and\r\ninteresting than useful.\r\n\r\nWild crab, _Pyrus coronaria_* and _P. Iœnsis_.*\r\n\r\nVery showy while in flower, blooming after apple blossoms have fallen;\r\nold specimens become picturesque in form. _P. Iœnsis flore pleno_‡\r\n(Bechtel’s Crab) is a handsome double form.\r\n\r\nSiberian crab, _P. baccata_.‡ Excellent small tree, both in flower and\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nFlowering crab, _Pyrus floribunda_. Pretty both in flower and fruit; a\r\nlarge shrub or small tree; various forms.\r\n\r\nHall’s crab, _P. Halliana_ (_P. Parkmani_). One of the best of the\r\nflowering crabs, particularly the double form. Various forms of\r\ndouble-flowering apple are on the market.\r\n\r\nSwamp white oak, _Quercus bicolor_.*† A desirable tree, usually\r\nneglected; very picturesque in winter.\r\n\r\nBur oak, _Q. macrocarpa_.*†\r\n\r\nChestnut oak, _Q.

Phellos_*\r\n\r\nEnglish oak, _Q. Robur_. Many forms represented by two types, probably\r\ngood species, _Q. pedunculata_ (with stalked acorns) and _Q.\r\nsessiliflora_ (with stalkless acorns). Some of the forms are reliable\r\nin the Northern states.\r\n\r\nThe oaks are slow growers and usually transplant with difficulty.\r\nNatural specimens are most valuable. A large well-grown oak is one of\r\nthe grandest of trees.\r\n\r\nLocust, _Robinia Pseudacacia_.*† Attractive in flower; handsome as\r\nsingle specimens when young; many forms; used also for hedges.\r\n\r\nPeach-leaved willow, _Salix amygdaloides_.* Very handsome small tree,\r\ndeserving more attention. This and the next valuable in low places or\r\nalong water-courses.\r\n\r\nBlack willow, _S. nigra_.*\r\n\r\nWeeping willow, _S. Babylonica_.\r\n\r\nTo be planted sparingly, preferably near water; the sort known as the\r\nWisconsin weeping willow appears to be much hardier than the common\r\ntype; many forms.\r\n\r\nWhite willow, _S. alba_, and various varieties, one of which is the\r\nGolden willow.\r\n\r\nTree willows are most valuable, as a rule, when used for temporary\r\nplantations or as nurses for better trees.\r\n\r\nLaurel-leaved willow, _S. laurifolia_‡\r\n\r\nA small tree used in cold regions for shelter-belts; also a good\r\nornamental tree. See also under Shrubs.\r\n\r\nSassafras, _Sassafras officinalis_.*†\r\n\r\nSuitable in the borders of groups or for single specimens; peculiar in\r\nwinter; too much neglected.\r\n\r\nRowan or European mountain ash, _Sorbus Aucuparia_ (_Pyrus\r\nAucuparia_).‡\r\n\r\nService-tree, _S. domestica_.\r\n\r\nFruit handsomer than that of the mountain ash and more persistent;\r\nsmall tree.\r\n\r\nOak-leaved mountain ash, _S. hybrida_ (_S. quercifolia_).\r\n\r\nSmall tree, deserving to be better known.\r\n\r\nBald cypress, _Taxodium distichum_.*\r\n\r\nNot entirely hardy at Lansing, Mich.; often becomes scraggly after\r\nfifteen or twenty years, but a good tree; many cultural forms.\r\n\r\nAmerican linden or basswood, _Tilia Americana_.*†\r\n\r\nVery valuable for single trees on large lawns, or for roadsides.\r\n\r\nEuropean linden, _T. vulgaris_ and _T. platyphyllos_ (_T. Europaea_ of\r\nnurserymen is probably usually the latter).†\r\n\r\nHas the general character of the American basswood.\r\n\r\nEuropean silver linden, _T. tomentosa_ and varieties.†\r\n\r\nVery handsome; leaves silvery white beneath; among others is a weeping\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nAmerican elm, _Ulmus Americana_.*†\r\n\r\nOne of the most graceful and variable of trees; useful for many\r\npurposes and a standard street tree.\r\n\r\nCork elm, _U. racemosa_.* Softer in aspect than the last, and more\r\npicturesque in winter, having prominent ridges of bark on its branches;\r\nslow grower.\r\n\r\nRed or slippery elm, _U. fulva_.* Occasionally useful in a group or\r\nshelter-belt; a stiff grower.\r\n\r\nEnglish elm, _U. campestris_, and Scotch or wych elm, _U. scabra_ (_U.\r\nmantana_). Often planted, but are inferior to _U. Americana_ for street\r\nplanting, although useful in collections. These have many horticultural\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n_Non-coniferous trees for the South_.\r\n\r\nAmong deciduous trees for the region of Washington and south may be\r\nmentioned: Acer, the American and European species as for the North;\r\n_Catalpa bignonioides_ and especially _C. speciosa_; celtis; cercis,\r\nboth American and Japanese; flowering dogwood, profusely native; white\r\nash; ginkgo; kœlreuteria; sweet gum (liquidambar); American linden;\r\ntulip tree; magnolias much as for the North; China-berry (_Melia\r\nAzedarach_); Texas umbrella-tree (var. _umbraculiformis_ of the\r\npreceding); mulberries; oxydendrum; paulownia; oriental plane-tree;\r\nnative oaks of the regions; _Robinia Pseudacacia_; weeping willow;\r\n_Sophora Japonica; Sterculia platanifolia_; American elm.\r\n\r\nBroad-leaved evergreens of real tree size useful for the South may be\r\nfound among the cherry laurels, magnolias, and oaks. Among the cherry\r\nlaurels are: Portugal laurel (_Prunus Lusitanica_), English cherry\r\nlaurel in several forms (_P. Laurocerasus_), and the “mock-orange” or\r\n“wild orange” (_P. Caroliniana_). In magnolia, the splendid _M.\r\ngrandiflora_ is everywhere used. In oaks, the live-oak (_Quercus\r\nVirginiana_, known also as _Q. virens_ and _Q. sempervirens_) is the\r\nuniversal species. The cork oak (_Q. Suber_) is also recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI: The flower-garden of China asters with border, one of the dusty\r\nmillers (_Centaurea_).

CONIFEROUS EVERGREEN SHRUBS AND TREES\r\n\r\nIn this country the word “evergreen” is understood to mean coniferous\r\ntrees with persistent leaves, as pines, spruces, firs, cedars,\r\njunipers, arborvitæ, retinosporas, and the like. These trees have\r\nalways been favorites with plant lovers, as they have very distinctive\r\nforms and other characteristics. Many of them are of the easiest\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nIt is a common notion that, since spruces and other conifers grow so\r\nsymmetrically, they will not stand pruning; but this is an error. They\r\nmay be pruned with as good effect as other trees, and if they tend to\r\ngrow too tall, the leader may be stopped without fear. A new leader\r\nwill arise, but in the meantime the upward growth of the tree will be\r\nsomewhat checked, and the effect will be to make the tree dense. The\r\ntips of the branches may also be headed in with the same effect. The\r\nbeauty of an evergreen lies in its natural form; therefore, it should\r\nnot be sheared into unusual shapes, but a gentle trimming back, as I\r\nsuggested, will tend to prevent the Norway spruce and others from\r\ngrowing open and ragged. After the tree attains some age, 4 or 5 in.\r\nmay be taken off the ends of the main branches every year or two (in\r\nspring before growth begins) with good results. This slight trimming is\r\nordinarily done with Waters’s long-handled pruning shears.\r\n\r\nThere is much difference of opinion as to the proper time for the\r\ntransplanting of evergreens, which means that there is more than one\r\nseason in which they may be moved. It is ordinarily unsafe to\r\ntransplant them in the fall in northern climates or bleak situations,\r\nsince the evaporation from the foliage during the winter is likely to\r\ninjure the plant. The best results are usually secured in spring or\r\nsummer planting. In spring they may be moved rather late, just as new\r\ngrowth is beginning. Some persons also plant them in August or early\r\nSeptember, as the roots secure a hold on the soil before winter. In the\r\nSouthern states transplanting may be done at most times of the year,\r\nbut late fall and early spring are usually advised.\r\n\r\nIn transplanting conifers, it is very important that the roots be not\r\nexposed to the sun. They should be moistened and covered with burlaps\r\nor other material. The holes should be ready to receive them. If the\r\ntrees are large, or if it has been necessary to trim in the roots, the\r\ntop should be cut when the tree is set.\r\n\r\nLarge evergreens (those 10 ft. and more high) are usually best\r\ntransplanted late in winter, at a time when a large ball of earth may\r\nbe moved with them. A trench is dug around the tree, it being deepened\r\na little day by day so that the frost can work into the earth and hold\r\nit in shape. When the ball is thoroughly frozen, it is hoisted on to a\r\nstone-boat or truck (Fig. 148) and moved to its new position.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the handsomest of all the native conifers of the northeastern\r\nUnited States is the ordinary hemlock, or hemlock spruce (the one so\r\nmuch used for lumber); but it is usually difficult to move.\r\nTransplanted trees from nurseries are usually safest. If the trees are\r\ntaken from the wild, they should be selected from open and sunny\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nFor neat and compact effects near porches and along walks, the dwarf\r\nretinosporas are very useful.\r\n\r\nMost of the pines and spruces are too coarse for planting very close to\r\nthe residence. They are better at some distance removed, where they\r\nserve as a background to other planting. If they are wanted for\r\nindividual specimens, they should be given plenty of room, so that the\r\nlimbs will not be crowded and the tree become misshapen. Whatever else\r\nis done to the spruces and firs, the lower limbs should not be trimmed\r\nup, at least not until the tree has become so old that the lowest\r\nbranches die. Some species hold their branches much longer than others.\r\nThe oriental spruce (_Picea orientalis_) is one of the best in this\r\nrespect. The occasional slight heading-in, that has been mentioned,\r\nwill tend to preserve the lower limbs, and it will not be marked enough\r\nto alter the form of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe number of excellent coniferous evergreens now offered in the\r\nAmerican trade is large. They are slow of growth and require much room\r\nif good specimens are to be obtained; but if the space can be had and\r\nthe proper exposure secured, no trees add greater dignity and\r\ndistinction to an estate. Reliable comments on the rarer conifers may\r\nbe found in the catalogues of the best nurserymen.\r\n\r\n_List of shrubby conifers_.\r\n\r\nThe following list contains the most usual of the shrub-like coniferous\r\nevergreens, with * to mark those native to this country. The ‡ in this\r\nand the succeeding list marks those species that are found to be hardy\r\nat Ottawa, Ontario, and are recommended by the Central Experimental\r\nFarm of Canada.\r\n\r\nDwarf arborvitæ, _Thuja occidentalis_.*\r\n\r\nThere are many dwarf and compact varieties of arborvitæ, most of which\r\nare excellent for small places. The most desirable for general\r\npurposes, and also the largest, is the so-called Siberian. Other very\r\ndesirable forms are those sold as _globosa, ericoides, compacta,‡\r\nHovey,‡ Ellwangeriana,‡ pyramidalis,‡ Wareana_ (or _Sibirica_),‡ and\r\n_aurea Douglasii_.‡\r\n\r\nJapanese arborvitæ or retinospora, _Chamœcyparis_ of various species.\r\n\r\nRetinosporas‡ under names as follows: _Cupressus ericoides_, 2 ft.,\r\nwith fine soft delicate green foliage that assumes a purplish tinge in\r\nwinter; _C. pisifera,_ one of the best, with a pendulous habit and\r\nbright green foliage; _C. pisifera_ var. _filifera_, with drooping\r\nbranches and thread-like pendulous branches; _C. pisifera_ var.\r\n_plumosa_, more compact than _P. pisifera_ and feathery; var. _aurea_\r\nof the last, “one of the most beautiful golden-leaved evergreen shrubs\r\nin cultivation.”\r\n\r\nJuniper, _Juniperus communis_* and garden varieties.\r\n\r\nThe juniper is a partially trailing plant, of loose habit, suitable for\r\nbanks and rocky places.

WINDOW-GARDENS\r\n\r\nAlthough the making of window-gardens may not be properly a part of the\r\nplanting and ornamenting of the home grounds, yet the appearance of the\r\nresidence has a marked effect on the attractiveness or unattractiveness\r\nof the premises; and there is no better place than this in which to\r\ndiscuss the subject. Furthermore, window-gardening is closely\r\nassociated with various forms of temporary plant protection about the\r\nresidence (Fig. 268).\r\n\r\nWindow-gardens are of two types: the window-box and porch-box type, in\r\nwhich the plants are grown outside the window and which is a summer or\r\nwarm-weather effort; the interior or true window-garden, made for the\r\nenjoyment of the family in its internal relations, and which is chiefly\r\na winter or cold-weather effort.\r\n\r\n_The window-box for outside effect_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 268. A protection for chrysanthemums. Very good\r\nplants can be grown under a temporary shed cover. The roof may be of\r\nglass, oiled paper, or even of wood. Such a shed cover will afford a\r\nvery effective and handy protection for many plants.]\r\n\r\nHandsomely finished boxes, ornamental tiling, and bracket work of wood\r\nand iron suitable for fitting out windows for the growing of plants,\r\nare on the market; but such, while desirable, are by no means\r\nnecessary. A stout pine box of a length corresponding to the width of\r\nthe window, about 10 inches wide and 6 deep, answers quite as well as a\r\nfiner box, since it will likely be some distance above the street, and\r\nits sides, moreover, are soon covered by the vines. A zinc tray of a\r\nsize to fit into the wooden box may be ordered of the tinsmith. It will\r\ntend to keep the soil from drying out so rapidly, but it is not a\r\nnecessity. A few small holes in the bottom will provide for drainage;\r\nbut with carefulness in watering these are not necessary, since the box\r\nby its exposed position will dry out readily during summer weather,\r\nunless the position is a shaded one. In the latter case provision for\r\ngood drainage is always advisable.\r\n\r\nSince there is more or less cramping of roots, it will be necessary to\r\nmake the soil richer than would be required were the plants to grow in\r\nthe garden. The most desirable soil is one that does not pack hard like\r\nclay, nor contract much when dry, but remains porous and springy. Such\r\na soil is found in the potting earth used by florists, and it may be\r\nobtained from them at 50 cents to $1 a barrel. Often the nature of the\r\nsoil will be such as to make it desirable to have at hand a barrel of\r\nsharp sand for mixing with it, to make it more porous and prevent\r\nbaking. A good filling for a deep box is a layer of clinkers or other\r\ndrainage in the bottom, a layer of pasture sod, a layer of old cow\r\nmanure, and fill with fertile garden earth.\r\n\r\nSome window-gardeners pot the plants and then set them in the\r\nwindow-box, filling the spaces between the pots with moist moss. Others\r\nplant them directly in the earth. The former method, as a general rule,\r\nis to be preferred in the winter window-garden; the latter in the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe plants most valuable for outside boxes are those of drooping habit,\r\nsuch as lobelias, tropeolums, othonna, Kenilworth ivy, verbena (Fig.\r\n269), sweet alyssum, and petunia. Such plants may occupy the front row,\r\nwhile back of them may be the erect-growing plants, as geraniums,\r\nheliotropes, begonias (Plate XX).\r\n\r\nFor shady situations the main dependence is on plants of graceful form\r\nor handsome foliage; while for the sunny window the selection may be of\r\nblooming plants. Of the plants mentioned below for these two positions,\r\nthose marked with an asterisk * are of climbing habit, and may be\r\ntrained up about the sides of the window.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 269. Bouquet of verbenas.]\r\n\r\nJust what plants will be most suitable depends on the exposure. For the\r\nshady side of the street, the more delicate kinds of plants may be\r\nused. For full exposure to the sun, it will be necessary to choose the\r\nmore vigorous-growing kinds. In the latter position, suitable plants\r\nfor drooping would be: tropeolums,* passifloras,* the single petunias,\r\nsweet alyssum, lobelias, verbenas, mesembryanthemums. For erect-growing\r\nplants: geraniums, heliotropes, phlox. If the position is a shaded one,\r\nthe drooping plants might be of the following: tradescantia, Kenilworth\r\nivy, senecio* or parlor ivy, sedums, moneywort,* vinca, smilax,*\r\nlygodium* or climbing fern. Erect-growing plants would be dracenas,\r\npalms, ferns, coleus, centaurea, spotted calla, and others.\r\n\r\nAfter the plants have filled the earth with roots, it will be desirable\r\nto give the surface among them a very light sprinkling of bone-dust or\r\na thicker coating of rotted manure from time to time during the summer;\r\nor instead of this, a watering with weak liquid manure about once a\r\nweek. This is not necessary, however, until the growth shows that the\r\nroots have about exhausted the soil.\r\n\r\nIn the fall the box may be placed on the inside of the window. In this\r\ncase it will be desirable to thin out the foliage somewhat, shorten in\r\nsome of the vines, and perhaps remove some of the plants. It will also\r\nbe desirable to give a fresh coating of rich soil. Increased care will\r\nbe necessary, also, in watering, since the plants will have less light\r\nthan previously, and, moreover, there may be no provision for drainage.\r\n\r\nPorch-boxes may be made in the same general plan. Since the plants are\r\nlikely to be injured in porch-boxes, and since these boxes should have\r\nsome architectural effect, it is well to use abundantly of rather heavy\r\ngreenery, such as swordfern (the common form of _Nephrolepis exaltata_)\r\nor the Boston fern, _Asparagus Sprengeri_, wandering jew, the large\r\ndrooping vinca (perhaps the variegated form), aspidistra. With these or\r\nsimilar things constituting the body of the box planting, the flowering\r\nplants may be added to heighten the effect.\r\n\r\n_The inside window-garden, or “house plants_.”\r\n\r\nThe winter window-garden may consist simply of a jardinière, or a few\r\nchoice pot-plants on a stand at the window, or of a considerable\r\ncollection with more or less elaborate arrangements for their\r\naccommodation in the way of box, brackets, shelves, and stands.\r\nExpensive arrangements are by no means necessary, nor is a large\r\ncollection. The plants and flowers themselves are the main\r\nconsideration, and a small collection well cared for is better than a\r\nlarge one unless it can be easily accommodated and kept in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe box will be seen near at hand, and so it may be more or less\r\nornamental in character. The sides may be covered with ornamental tile\r\nheld in place by molding; or a light latticework of wood surrounding\r\nthe box is pretty. But a neatly made and strong box of about the\r\ndimensions mentioned on page 337, with a strip of molding at the top\r\nand bottom, answers just as well; and if painted green, or some neutral\r\nshade, only the plants will be seen or thought of. Brackets,\r\njardinières, and stands may be purchased of any of the larger florists.\r\n\r\nThe box may consist of merely the wooden receptacle; but a preferable\r\narrangement is to make it about eight inches deep instead of six, then\r\nhave the tinsmith make a zinc tray to fit the box. This is provided\r\nwith a false wooden bottom, with cracks for drainage, two inches above\r\nthe real bottom of the tray. The plants will then have a vacant space\r\nbelow them into which drainage water may pass. Such a box may be\r\nthoroughly watered as the plants require without danger of the water\r\nrunning on the carpet. Of course, a faucet should be provided at some\r\nsuitable point on a level with the bottom of the tray, to permit of its\r\nbeing drained every day or so if the water tends to accumulate. It\r\nwould not do to allow the water to remain long; especially should it\r\nnever rise to the false bottom, as then the soil would be kept too wet.\r\n\r\nThe window for plants should have a southern, southeastern, or eastern\r\nexposure. Plants need all the light they can get in the winter,\r\nespecially those that are expected to bloom. The window should be\r\ntight-fitting. Shutters and a curtain will be an advantage in cold\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nPlants like a certain uniformity in conditions. It is very trying on\r\nthem, and often fatal to success, to have them snug and warm one night\r\nand pinched in a temperature only a few degrees above freezing the\r\nnext. Some plants will live in spite of it, but they cannot be expected\r\nto prosper. Those whose rooms are heated with steam, hot water, or hot\r\nair will have to guard against keeping rooms too warm fully as much as\r\nkeeping them too cool. Rooms in brick dwellings that have been warm all\r\nday, if shut up and made snug in the evening, will often keep warm over\r\nnight without heat except in the coldest weather. Rooms in frame\r\ndwellings exposed on all sides soon cool down.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to grow plants in rooms lighted by gas. Most\r\nliving-rooms have air too dry for plants. In such cases the bow-window\r\nmay be set off from the room by glass doors; one then has a miniature\r\nconservatory. A pan of water on the stove or on the register and damp\r\nmoss among the pots, will help to afford plants the necessary humidity.\r\n\r\nThe foliage will need cleansing from time to time to free it from dust.\r\nA bath tub provided with a ready outlet for the water is an excellent\r\nplace for this purpose. The plants may be turned on their sides and\r\nsupported on a small box above the bottom of the tub. Then they may be\r\nfreely syringed without danger of making the soil too wet. It is\r\nusually advisable not to wet the flowers, however, especially the white\r\nwaxen kinds, like hyacinths. The foliage of rex begonias should be\r\ncleansed with a piece of dry or only slightly moist cotton. But if the\r\nleaves can be quickly dried off by placing them in the open air on mild\r\ndays, or moderately near the stove, the foliage may be syringed.\r\n\r\nSome persons attach the box to the window, or support it on brackets\r\nattached below the window-sill; but a preferable arrangement is to\r\nsupport the box on a low and light stand of suitable height provided\r\nwith rollers. It may then be drawn back from the window, turned around\r\nfrom time to time to give the plants light on all sides, or turned with\r\nthe attractive side in as may be desired.\r\n\r\nOften the plants are set directly in the soil; but if they are kept in\r\npots they may be rearranged, and changed about to give those which need\r\nit more light. Larger plants that are to stand on shelves or brackets\r\nmay be in porous earthenware pots; but the smaller ones that are to\r\nfill the window-box may be placed in heavy paper pots. The sides of\r\nthese are flexible, and the plants in them therefore may be crowded\r\nclose together with great economy in space. When pots are spaced, damp\r\nsphagnum or other moss among them will hold them in place, keep the\r\nsoil from drying out too rapidly, and at the same time give off\r\nmoisture, so grateful to the foliage.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the stand, or box, a bracket for one or more pots on\r\neither side of the window, about one-third or half-way up, will be\r\ndesirable. The bracket should turn on a basal hinge or pivot, to admit\r\nof swinging it forward or backward. These bracket plants usually suffer\r\nfor moisture, and are rather difficult to manage.\r\n\r\nFlorists now usually grow plants suitable for window-gardens and winter\r\nflowering, and any intelligent florist, if asked, will take pleasure in\r\nmaking out a suitable collection. The plants should be ordered early in\r\nthe fall; the florist will then not be so crowded for time and can give\r\nthe matter better attention.\r\n\r\nMost of the plants suitable for the winter window-garden belong to the\r\ngroups that florists grow in their medium and cool houses. The former\r\nare given a night temperature of about 60°, the latter about 50°. In\r\neach case the temperature is 10 to 15° higher for the daytime. Five\r\ndegrees of variation below these temperatures will be allowable without\r\nany injurious effects; even more may be borne, but not without more or\r\nless check to the plants. In bright, sunny weather the day temperature\r\nmay be higher than in cloudy and dark weather.\r\n\r\nPlants for an average night temperature of 60° (trade names).\r\n\r\n_Upright flowering plants_,—Abutilons, browallias, calceolaria “Lincoln\r\nPark,” begonias, bouvardias, euphorbias, scarlet sage, richardia or\r\ncalla, heliotropes, fuchsias, Chinese hibiscus, jasmines, single\r\npetunias, swainsona, billbergia, freesias, geraniums, eupheas.\r\n\r\n_Upright foliage plants_.—Muehlenbeckia, _Cycas revoluta, Dracœna\r\nfragans_ and others, palms, cannas, _Farfugium grande_, achyranthes,\r\nferns, araucarias, epiphyllums, pandanus or “screw pine,” _Pilea\r\narborea, Ficus elastica, Grevillea robusta_.\r\n\r\n_Climbing plants_.—_Asparagus tenuissimus, A. plumosus, Cobœa\r\nscandens,_ smilax, Japanese hop, Madeira vine (Boussingaultia),\r\n_Senecio mikanioides_ and _S. macroglossus_ (parlor ivies).

The labor, time, and skill required is much less than\r\nfor growing many of the larger plants more commonly used for winter\r\ndecorations (for instructions on growing bulbs out-of-doors, see p.\r\n281; also the entries in Chapter VIII).\r\n\r\nHyacinths, narcissus, tulips, and crocus, and others can be made to\r\nflower in the winter without difficulty. Secure the bulbs so as to be\r\nable to pot them by the middle or last of October, or if earlier all\r\nthe better. The soil should be rich sandy loam, if possible; if not,\r\nthe best that can be got, to which about one-fourth the bulk of sand is\r\nadded and mixed thoroughly.\r\n\r\nIf ordinary flower-pots are to be used, place in the bottom a few\r\npieces of broken pots, charcoal, or small stones for drainage, then\r\nfill the pot with dirt so that when the bulbs are set on the dirt the\r\ntop of the bulb is even with the rim of the pot. Fill around it with\r\nsoil, leaving just the tip of the bulb showing above the earth. If the\r\nsoil is heavy, a good plan is to sprinkle a small handful of sand under\r\nthe bulb to carry off the water, as is done in the beds outdoors. If\r\none does not have pots, he may use boxes. Starch boxes are a good size\r\nto use, as they are not heavy to handle; and excellent flowers are\r\nsometimes secured from bulbs planted in old tomato-cans. If boxes or\r\ncans are used, care must be taken to have holes in the bottoms to let\r\nthe water run out. A large hyacinth bulb will do well in a 5-inch pot.\r\nThe same size pot will do for three or four narcissuses or eight to\r\ntwelve crocuses.\r\n\r\nAfter the bulbs are planted in the pots or other receptacles, they\r\nshould be placed in a cool place, either in a cold pit or cellar, or on\r\nthe shady side of a building, or, better yet, plunged or buried up to\r\nthe rim of the pot in a shady border. This is done to force the roots\r\nto grow while the top stands still, as only the bulbs with good roots\r\nwill give good flowers. When the weather gets so cold that a crust is\r\nfrozen on the soil, the pots should be covered with a little straw, and\r\nas the weather gets colder more straw must be used. In six to eight\r\nweeks after planting the bulbs, they should have made roots enough to\r\ngrow the plant, and they may be taken up and placed in a cool room for\r\na week or so, after which, if they have started into growth, they may\r\nbe taken into a warmer room where they can have plenty of light. They\r\nwill grow very rapidly now and will want much water, and after the\r\nflowers begin to show, the pots may stand in a saucer of water all the\r\ntime. When just coming into bloom the plants may have full sunlight\r\npart of the time to help bring out the color of the flowers.\r\n\r\nHyacinths, tulips, and narcissus all require similar treatment. When\r\nwell rooted, which will be in six or eight weeks, they are brought out\r\nand given a temperature of some 55° to 60° till the flowers appear,\r\nwhen they should be kept in a cooler temperature, say 50°. The single\r\nRoman hyacinth is an excellent house plant. The flowers are small, but\r\nthey are graceful and are well adapted to cutting. It is early.\r\n\r\nThe Easter lily is managed the same way, except to hasten its flowers\r\nit should be kept at not lower than 60° at night. Warmer will be\r\nbetter. Lily bulbs may be covered an inch or more deep in the pots.\r\n\r\nFreesias may be potted six or more in a pot of mellow soil, and then\r\nstarted into growth at once. At first they may be given a night\r\ntemperature of 50°; and 55° to 60° when they have begun to grow.\r\n\r\nSmall bulbs, as snowdrop and crocus, are planted several or a dozen in\r\na pot and buried, or treated like hyacinths; but they are very\r\nsensitive to heat, and require to be given the light only when they\r\nhave started to grow, without any forcing. Forty to 45° will be as warm\r\nas they ever need be kept.\r\n\r\n_Watering house plants_.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give rules for the watering of plants. Conditions\r\nthat hold with one grower are different from those of another. Advice\r\nmust be general. Give one good watering at the time of potting, after\r\nwhich no water should be given until the plants really need it. If, on\r\ntapping the pot, it gives out a clear ring, it is an indication that\r\nwater is needed. In the case of a soft-wooded plant, just before the\r\nleaves begin to show signs of wilt is the time for watering. When\r\nplants are taken up from the ground, or have their roots cut back in\r\nrepotting, gardeners rely, after the first copious watering, on\r\nsyringing the tops two or three times each day, until a new root-growth\r\nhas started, watering at the roots only when absolutely necessary.\r\nPlants that have been potted into larger pots will grow without the\r\nextra attention of syringing, but those from the borders that have had\r\ntheir roots mutilated or shortened, should be placed in a cool, shady\r\nspot and be syringed often. One soon becomes familiar with the wants of\r\nindividual plants, and can judge closely as to need of water. All\r\nsoft-wooded plants with a large leaf-surface need more water than\r\nhard-wooded plants, and a plant in luxuriant growth of any kind more\r\nthan one that has been cut back or become defoliated. When plants are\r\ngrown in living-rooms, moisture must be supplied from some source, and\r\nif no arrangement has been made for securing moist air, the plants\r\nshould be syringed often.\r\n\r\nAll plant-growers should learn to withhold water when plants are\r\n“resting” or not in active growth. Thus camellias, azaleas, rex\r\nbegonias, palms, and many other things are usually not in their growing\r\nperiod in fall and midwinter, and they should then have only sufficient\r\nwater to keep them in condition. When growth begins, apply water; and\r\nincrease the water as the growth becomes more rapid.\r\n\r\n_Hanging baskets_.\r\n\r\nTo have a good hanging basket, it is necessary that some careful\r\nprovision be made to prevent too rapid drying out of the earth. It is\r\ncustomary, therefore, to line the pot or basket with moss. Open wire\r\nbaskets, like a horse muzzle, are often lined with moss and used for\r\nthe growing of plants. Prepare the earth by mixing some well-decayed\r\nleafmold with rich garden loam, thereby making an earth that will\r\nretain moisture. Hang the basket in a light place, but still not in\r\ndirect sunlight; and, if possible, avoid putting it where it will be\r\nexposed to drying wind. In order to water the basket, it is often\r\nadvisable to sink it into a pail or tub of water.\r\n\r\nVarious plants are well adapted to hanging baskets. Among the drooping\r\nor vine-like kinds are the strawberry geranium, Kenilworth ivy,\r\nmaurandia, German ivy, canary-bird flower, _Asparagus Sprengeri_, ivy\r\ngeranium, trailing fuchsia, wandering jew, and othonna. Among the\r\nerect-growing plants that produce flowers, _Lobelia Erinus_, sweet\r\nalyssum, petunias, oxalis, and various geraniums are to be recommended.\r\nAmong foliage plants such things as coleus, dusty miller, begonia, and\r\nsome geraniums are adaptable.\r\n\r\n_Aquarium_.\r\n\r\nA pleasant adjunct to a window-garden, living room, or conservatory, is\r\na large glass globe or glass box containing water, in which plants and\r\nanimals are living and growing. A solid glass tank or globe is better\r\nthan a box with glass sides, because it does not leak, but the box must\r\nbe used if one wants a large aquarium. For most persons it is better to\r\nbuy the aquarium box than to attempt to make it. Five points are\r\nimportant in making and keeping an aquarium:\r\n\r\n(1) The equilibrium between plant and animal life must be secured and\r\nmaintained;\r\n\r\n(2) the aquarium must be open on top to the air or well ventilated;\r\n\r\n(3) the temperature should be kept between 40° and 50° for ordinary\r\nanimals and plants (do not place in full sun in a hot window);\r\n\r\n(4) it is well to choose such animals for the aquarium as are adapted\r\nto life in still water;\r\n\r\n(5) the water must be kept fresh, either by the proper balance of plant\r\nand animal life or by changing the water frequently, or by both.\r\n\r\nThe aquatic plants of the neighborhood may be kept in the\r\naquarium,—such things as myriophyllums, charas, eel-grass, duckmeats or\r\nlemnas, cabomba or fish grass, arrow-leafs or sagittaria, and the like;\r\nalso the parrot’s feather, to be bought of florists (a species of\r\nmyriophyllum). Of animals, there are fishes (particularly minnows),\r\nwater insects, tadpoles, clams, snails. If the proper balance is\r\nmaintained between plant and animal life, it will not be necessary to\r\nchange the water so frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nTHE GROWING OF THE ORNAMENTAL PLANTS—INSTRUCTIONS ON PARTICULAR KINDS\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter advice is given that applies to groups or\r\nclasses of plants, and many lists are inserted to guide the grower in\r\nhis choice or at least to suggest to him the kinds of things that may\r\nbe grown for certain purposes or conditions. It now remains to give\r\ninstructions on the growing of particular kinds or species of plants.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to include instructions on any great number of plants\r\nin a book like this. It is assumed that the user of this book already\r\nknows how to grow the familiar or easily handled plants; if he does\r\nnot, a book is not likely to help him very much. In this chapter all\r\nsuch things as the common annuals and perennials and shrubs and trees\r\nare omitted. If the reader is in doubt about any of these, or desires\r\ninformation concerning them, he will have to consult the catalogues of\r\nresponsible seedsmen and nurserymen or cyclopedic works, or go to some\r\ncompetent person for advice.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter are brought together instructions on the growing of\r\nsuch plants commonly found about home grounds and in window-gardens as\r\nseem to demand somewhat special or particular treatment or about which\r\nthe novice is likely to ask; and of course these instructions must be\r\nbrief.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. The peony. One of the most steadfast of garden flowers. XVII. The\r\npeony. One of the most steadfast of garden flowers.\r\n\r\nIt may be repeated here that a person cannot expect to grow a plant\r\nsatisfactorily until he learns the natural time of the plant to grow\r\nand to bloom. Many persons handle their begonias, cacti, and azaleas as\r\nif they should be active the whole year round. The key to the situation\r\nis water: at what part of the year to withhold and at what part to\r\napply is one of the very first things to learn.\r\n\r\nAbutilons, or flowering maples as they are often called, make good\r\nhouse plants and bedding plants. Nearly all house gardeners have at\r\nleast one plant.\r\n\r\nCommon abutilons may be grown from seed or from cuttings of young wood.\r\nIf the former, the seed should be sown in February or March in a\r\ntemperature of not less than 60°. The seedlings should be potted when\r\nabout four to six leaves have grown, in a rich sandy soil. Frequent\r\npottings should be made to insure a rapid growth, making plants large\r\nenough to flower by fall. Or the seedlings may be planted out in the\r\nborder when danger of frost is over, and taken up in the fall before\r\nfrost; these plants will bloom all winter. About one half of the newer\r\ngrowth should be cut off when they are taken up, as they are very\r\nliable to spindle up when grown in the house. When grown from cuttings,\r\nyoung wood should be used, which, after being well rooted, may be\r\ntreated in the same way as the seedlings.\r\n\r\nThe varieties with variegated leaves have been improved until the\r\nfoliage effects are equal to the flowers of some varieties; and these\r\nare a great addition to the conservatory or window garden. The staple\r\nspotted-leaved type is _A. Thompsoni_. A compact form, now much used\r\nfor bedding and other outdoor work, is _Savitzii_, which is a\r\nhorticultural variety, not a distinct species. The old-fashioned\r\ngreen-leaved _A. striatum_, from which _A. Thompsoni_ has probably\r\nsprung, is one of the best. _A. megapotamicum_ or _vexillarium_ is a\r\ntrailing or drooping red-and-yellow-flowered species that is excellent\r\nfor baskets, although not now much seen. It propagates readily from\r\nseed. There is a form with spotted leaves.\r\n\r\nAbutilons are most satisfactory for house plants when they are not much\r\nmore than a year old. They need no special treatment.\r\n\r\nAgapanthus, or African lily _(Agapanthus umbellatus_ and several\r\nvarieties).—A tuberous-rooted, well-known conservatory or window plant,\r\nblooming in summer. Excellent for porch and yard decoration.\r\n\r\nIt lends itself to many conditions and proves satisfactory a large part\r\nof the year, the leaves forming a green arch over the pot, covering it\r\nentirely in a well-grown specimen. The flowers are borne in a large\r\ncluster on stems growing 2-3 ft. high, as many as two or three hundred\r\nbright blue flowers often forming on a single plant. A large,\r\nwell-grown plant throws up a number of flower-stalks through the early\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe one essential to free growth is an abundance of water and an\r\noccasional application of manure water. Propagation is effected by\r\ndivision of the offsets, which may be broken from the main plant in\r\nearly spring. After flowering, gradually lessen the quantity of water\r\nuntil they are placed in winter quarters, which should be a position\r\nfree from frost and moderately dry. The agapanthus, being a heavy\r\nfeeder, should be grown in strong loam to which is added well-rotted\r\nmanure and a little sand. When dormant, the roots will withstand a\r\nlittle frost.\r\n\r\nAlstremeria.—The alstremerias (of several species) belong to the\r\namaryllis family, being tuberous-rooted plants, having leafy stems\r\nterminating in a cluster of ten to fifty small lily-shaped flowers of\r\nrich colors in summer.\r\n\r\nMost of the alstremerias should be given pot culture, as they are\r\neasily grown and are not hardy in the open in the North. The culture is\r\nnearly that of the amaryllis,—a good, fibrous loam with a little sand,\r\npotting the tubers in early spring or late fall. Start the plants\r\nslowly, giving only enough water to cause root growth; but after growth\r\nhas become established, a quantity of water may be given. After\r\nflowering they may be treated as are amaryllis or agapanthus. The roots\r\nmay be divided, and the old and weak parts shaken out. The plants grow\r\n1-3 ft. high. The flowers often have odd colors.\r\n\r\nAmaryllis.—The popular name of a variety of house or conservatory\r\ntender bulbs, but properly applied only to the Belladonna lily. Most of\r\nthem are hippeastrums, but the culture of all is similar. They are\r\nsatisfactory house plants for spring and summer bloom. One difficulty\r\nwith their culture is the habit of the flower-stalk starting into\r\ngrowth before the leaves grow. This is caused in most cases by\r\nstimulating root growth before the bulb has had sufficient rest.\r\n\r\nThe bulbs should be dormant four or five months in a dry place with a\r\ntemperature of about 50°. When wanted to be brought into flower, the\r\nbulbs, if to be repotted, should have all the dirt shaken off and\r\npotted in soil composed of fibrous loam and leafmold, to which should\r\nbe added a little sand. If the loam is heavy, place the pot in a warm\r\nsituation; a spent hotbed is a good place. Water as needed, and as the\r\nflowers develop liquid manure may be given. If large clumps are well\r\nestablished in 8-or 10-inch pots, they may be top-dressed with new soil\r\ncontaining rotted manure, and as growth increases liquid manure may be\r\ngiven twice a week until the flowers open. After flowering, gradually\r\nwithhold water until the leaves die, or plunge the pots in the open, in\r\na sunny place. The most popular species for window-gardens is _A.\r\nJohnsoni_ (properly a hippeastrum), with red flowers. Figs. 257, 261.\r\n\r\nBulbs received from dealers should be placed in pots not much broader\r\nthan the bulb, and the neck of the bulb should not be covered. Keep\r\nrather dry until active growth begins. The ripened bulbs, in fall, may\r\nbe stored as potatoes, and then brought out in spring as rapidly as any\r\nof them show signs of growth.\r\n\r\nAnemone.—The wind-flowers are hardy perennials, of easy culture, one\r\ngroup (the _Anemone coronaria, fulgens_, and _hortensis_ forms) being\r\ntreated as bulbs. These tuberous-rooted plants should be planted late\r\nin September or early in October, in a well-enriched sheltered border,\r\nsetting the tubers 3 in. deep and 4-6 in. apart. The surface of the\r\nborder should be mulched with leaves or strawy manure through the\r\nsevere winter weather, uncovering the soil in March. The flowers will\r\nappear in April or May, and in June or July the tubers should be taken\r\nup and placed in dry sand until the following fall. These plants are\r\nnot as well known as they should be. The range of color is very wide.\r\nThe flowers are often 2 in. across, and are lasting. The tubers may be\r\nplanted in pots, bringing them into the conservatory or house at\r\nintervals through the winter, where they make an excellent showing when\r\nin bloom.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese anemone is a wholly different plant from the above. There\r\nare white-flowered and red-flowered varieties. The best known is _A.\r\nJaponica_ var. _alba_, or Honorine Jobert. This species blooms from\r\nAugust to November, and is at that season the finest of border plants.\r\nThe pure white flowers, with lemon-colored stamens, are held well up on\r\nstalks 2-3 ft. high. The flower-stems are long and excellent for\r\ncutting. This species may be propagated by division of the plants or by\r\nseed. The former method should be employed in the spring; the latter,\r\nas soon as the seeds are ripe in the fall. Sow the seed in boxes in a\r\nwarm, sheltered situation in the border or under glass. The seed should\r\nbe covered lightly with soil containing a quantity of sand and not\r\nallowed to become dry. A well-enriched, sheltered position in a border\r\nshould be given.\r\n\r\nThe little wild wind-flowers are easily colonized in a hardy border.\r\n\r\nAralia, _A. Sieboldii_ (properly _Fatsia Japonica_ and _F.\r\npapyrifera),_ as it is sometimes called, and the variety _variegata_,\r\nwith large, palmlike leaves, are grown for their tropical appearance.\r\n\r\nSow in February, in shallow trays and light soil, in a temperature of\r\n65°. Continue the temperature. When two or three leaves have formed,\r\ntransplant into other trays 1 in. apart. Sprinkle them with a fine rose\r\nor spray; and do not allow them to suffer for water. Later transfer\r\nthem to small pots and repot them as they grow. Plant out in beds after\r\nthe weather has become warm and settled. Half-hardy perennials in the\r\nNorth, becoming 3 ft. or more high; a shrub in the South and in\r\nCalifornia. Used often in subtropical work.\r\n\r\nAraucaria, or Norfolk Island pine, is now sold in pots by florists as a\r\nwindow plant. There are several species. The greenhouse specimens are\r\nthe juvenile state of plants that become large trees in their native\r\nregions; therefore, it is not to be expected that they will keep\r\nshapely and within bounds indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe common species _(A. excelsa_) makes a symmetrical evergreen\r\nsubject. It keeps well in a cool window, or on the veranda in the\r\nsummer. Protect it from direct sunlight, and give plenty of room. If\r\nthe plant begins to fail, return it to the florist for recuperation, or\r\nprocure a new plant.\r\n\r\nAuricula.—A half-hardy perennial of the primrose tribe _(Primula\r\nAuricula),_ very popular in Europe, but little grown in America on\r\naccount of the hot, dry summers.\r\n\r\nIn this country auriculas are usually propagated by seed, as for\r\ncineraria; but special varieties are perpetuated by offsets. Seeds sown\r\nin February or March should give blooming plants for the next February\r\nor March. Keep the plants cool and moist, and away from the direct sun\r\nduring the summer. Gardeners usually grow them in frames. In the fall,\r\nthey are potted into 3-in. or 4-in. pots, and made to bloom either in\r\nframes as for violets or in a cool conservatory or greenhouse. In\r\nApril, after blooming has ceased, repot the plants and treat as the\r\nprevious year. As with most annual-blooming perennials, best results\r\nare to be expected with year-old or two-year-old plants. Auriculas grow\r\n6-8 in. high. Colors white and many shades of red and blue.\r\n\r\nAzaleas are excellent outdoor and greenhouse shrubs, and are sometimes\r\nseen in windows. They are less grown in this country than in Europe,\r\nlargely because of our hot, dry summers and severe winters.\r\n\r\nThere are two common types or classes of azaleas: the hardy or Ghent\r\nazaleas, and the Indian azaleas. The latter are the familiar\r\nlarge-flowered azaleas of conservatories and window-gardens.\r\n\r\nGhent azaleas thrive in the open along the seacoast as far north as\r\nsouthern New England. They require a sandy peaty soil, but are treated\r\nas other shrubs are. The large flower-buds are liable to injury from\r\nthe warm suns of late winter and early spring, and to avoid this injury\r\nthe plants are often protected by covers or shades of brush. In the\r\ninterior country, little attempt is made to flower azaleas permanently\r\nin the open, although they may be grown if carefully tended and well\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\nBoth Ghent and Indian azaleas are excellent pot-plants for bloom in\r\nlate winter and spring. The plants are imported in great numbers from\r\nEurope in fall, and it is better to buy these plants than to attempt to\r\npropagate them. Pot them up in large-sized pots, keep them cool and\r\nbackward for a time until they are established, then take them into a\r\nconservatory temperature in which carnations and roses thrive. They\r\nshould be potted in a soil of half peat or well-decayed mold and half\r\nrich loam; add a little sand. Pot firmly, and be sure to provide\r\nsufficient drainage. Keep off red spider by syringing.\r\n\r\nAfter blooming, the plants may be thinned by pruning out the straggling\r\ngrowths, and repotted. Set them in a frame or in a semi-shaded place\r\nduring summer, and see that they make a good growth. The wood should be\r\nwell ripened in the fall. After cold weather sets in, keep the Indian\r\nor evergreen kinds half dormant by setting them in a cool, dull-lighted\r\ncellar or pit, bringing them in when wanted for bloom. The Ghent or\r\ndeciduous kinds may be touched with frost without injury; and they may\r\nbe kept in a cellar until wanted.\r\n\r\nBegonias are familiar tender bedding and house plants. Next to the\r\ngeranium, begonias are probably the most popular for house culture of\r\nthe entire plant list. The ease of culture, great variety of kinds,\r\nprofusion of bloom or richness of foliage, together with their\r\nadaptability to shade, make them very desirable.\r\n\r\nBegonias may be divided into three sections: the fibrous-rooted class,\r\nwhich contains the winter-flowering, branching kinds; the rex forms, or\r\nbeefsteak geraniums, having large ornamental leaves; the\r\ntuberous-rooted, those that bloom through the summer, the tuber resting\r\nin the winter.\r\n\r\n_The fibrous-rooted kinds_ may be propagated by seed or cuttings, the\r\nlatter being the usual method. Cuttings of half-ripened wood root\r\neasily, making a rapid growth, the plants flowering in a few months.\r\n\r\n_The rex type_, having no branches, is propagated from the leaves. The\r\nlarge mature leaves are used. The leaf may be cut into sections, having\r\nat the base a union of two ribs. These pieces of leaves may be inserted\r\nin the sand as any other cutting. Or a whole leaf may be used, cutting\r\nthrough the ribs at intervals and laying the leaf flat on the\r\npropagating bench or other warm, moist place. In a short time young\r\nplants having roots of their own will form. These may be potted when\r\nlarge enough to handle, and will soon make good plants (Fig 125).\r\n\r\nRex begonias usually grow little during winter, and they should\r\ntherefore be kept fairly dry and no effort made to push them. Be sure\r\nthat the pots are well drained, so that the soil does not become sour.\r\nNew plants—those a year or so old—are usually most satisfactory. Keep\r\nthem away from direct sunlight. An insidious disease of rex begonia\r\nleaves has recently made its appearance. The best treatment yet known\r\nis to propagate fresh plants, throwing away the old stock and the dirt\r\nin which it is grown.\r\n\r\n_The tuberous-rooted begonias_ make excellent bedding plants for those\r\nwho learn their simple but imperative requirements. They are also good\r\npot subjects for summer.\r\n\r\nThe amateur would better not attempt to grow the tuberous begonias from\r\nseed. He should purchase good two-year tubers. These should be able to\r\nrun for two or three years before they are so old or so much spent that\r\nthey give unsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nIn the North, the tubers are started indoors, for bedding, in February\r\nor early March in a rather warm temperature. They will fill a five-inch\r\npot before they are ready to be turned out into the ground. They should\r\nnot be planted out till the weather is thoroughly settled, for they\r\nwill not stand frost or unfavorable climatic conditions.\r\n\r\nThe plants should be given a soil that holds moisture, but is yet well\r\ndrained. They will not do well in water-logged ground. They should have\r\npartial shade; near the north side of a building is a good place for\r\nthem. Too much watering makes them soft and they tend to break down.\r\nKeep the foliage dry, particularly in sunny weather; the watering\r\nshould be done from underneath.\r\n\r\nAfter blooming, lift the bulbs, dry them off, and keep over winter in a\r\ncool place. They may be packed in shallow boxes in dry earth or sand.\r\n\r\nFlorists sometimes divide the tubers just after growth starts in the\r\nspring, so that a good eye may be got with each plant; but the amateur\r\nwould better use the entire tuber, unless he desires to increase or\r\nmultiply some particular plant.\r\n\r\nIf the house gardener desires to raise tuberous begonias from seed, he\r\nmust be prepared to exercise much patience. The seeds, like those of\r\nall begonias, are very small, and should be sown with great care. Start\r\nthe seeds in late winter. Simply sprinkle them on the surface of the\r\nsoil, which should be a mixture of leafmold and sand, with the addition\r\nof a small quantity of fibrous loam. Watering should be done by setting\r\nthe pot or box in which the seeds are sown in water, allowing the\r\nmoisture to ascend through the soil. When the soil has become\r\ncompletely saturated, set the box in a shady situation, covering it\r\nwith glass or some other object until the tiny seedlings appear. Never\r\nallow the soil to become dry. The seedlings should be transplanted, as\r\nsoon as they can be handled, into boxes or pots containing the same\r\nmixture of soil, setting each plant down to the seed-leaf. They will\r\nneed three or four transplantings before they reach the blooming stage,\r\nand at each one after the first, the proportion of fibrous loam may be\r\nincreased until the soil is composed of one-third each of loam, sand,\r\nand leafmold. The addition of a little well-rotted manure may be made\r\nat the last transplanting.\r\n\r\nCactus.—Various kinds of cactus are often seen in small collections of\r\nhouse plants, to which they add interest and oddity, being different\r\nfrom other plants.\r\n\r\nMost cacti are easy to grow, requiring little care and enduring the\r\nheat and dryness of a living room much better than most other plants.\r\nTheir requirements are ample drainage and open soil. Cactus growers\r\nusually make a soil by mixing pulverized plaster or lime refuse with\r\ngarden loam, using about two-thirds of the loam. The very fine parts,\r\nor dust, of the plaster, are blown out, else the soil is likely to\r\ncement. They may be rested at any season by simply setting them away in\r\na dry place for two or three months, and bringing them into heat and\r\nlight when they are wanted. As new growth advances they should have\r\nwater occasionally, and when in bloom, they should be watered freely.\r\nWithhold water gradually after blooming until they are to be rested.\r\n\r\nSome of the most common species in cultivation are the phyllocactus\r\nspecies, often called the night-blooming cereus. These are not the true\r\nnight-blooming cereuses, which have angular or cylindrical stems,\r\ncovered with bristles, while these have flat, leaf-like branches; the\r\nflowers of these, however, are very much like the cereus, opening at\r\nevening and closing before morning, and as the phyllocacti may be grown\r\nwith greater ease, blooming on smaller and younger plants, they are to\r\nbe recommended.\r\n\r\nThe true night-blooming cereuses are species of the genus Cereus. The\r\ncommonest one is _C. nycticalus_, but _C. grandiflorus, C.\r\ntriangularis_ and others are occasionally seen. These plants all have\r\nlong rod-like stems which are cylindrical or angular. These stems often\r\nreach a height of 10 to 30 ft., and they need support. They should be\r\ntrained along a pillar or tied to a stake. They are uninteresting\r\nleafless things during a large part of the year; but in midsummer,\r\nafter they are three or more years old, they throw out their great\r\ntubular flowers, which open at nightfall and wither and die when the\r\nlight strikes them next morning. They are very easily grown, either in\r\npots or planted in the natural soil in the conservatory. The only\r\nspecial care they need is good drainage at the roots, so that the soil\r\nwill not become soggy.\r\n\r\nThe epiphyllum, or lobster cactus, or crab cactus, is one of the best\r\nof the family, easy of culture. It bears bright-colored blossoms at the\r\nend of each joint. When in flower, which will be in the winter months,\r\nit requires a richer soil than the other cacti. A suitable soil is made\r\nof two-thirds fibrous loam and one third leafmold; usually it is best\r\nto add sand or pulverized brick. In fall and early winter, keep rather\r\ndry, giving more water as the plant comes into bloom.\r\n\r\nOpuntias, or prickly pears, are often grown as border plants through\r\nthe summer. In fact, all the family may be planted out, and if a number\r\nof kinds are set in a bed together, they make a striking addition to\r\nthe garden. Be very careful not to bruise the plants. It is better to\r\nplunge them in the pots than to turn them out of the pots.\r\n\r\nCaladium.—Tuberous-rooted, tender perennial plants used for\r\nconservatory decoration, and also for subtropical and bold effects in\r\nthe lawn (Plate IV). The plants commonly known under this name are\r\nreally colocasias.\r\n\r\nThe roots should be dormant in the winter, being kept in a warm cellar\r\nor under a greenhouse bench, where they are not liable to frost or\r\ndampness. The roots are usually covered with earth, but they are kept\r\ndry. Early in spring the roots are put into boxes or pots and are\r\nstarted into growth, so that by the time settled weather comes they\r\nwill be 1 or 2 feet high and ready to set directly into soil.\r\n\r\nWhen set out of doors, they should be protected from strong winds, and\r\nfrom the full glare of direct sunlight. The soil should be rich and\r\ndeep, and the plants should have an abundance of water. They do well\r\nabout ponds (see Plate X).\r\n\r\nCaladiums are most excellent plants for striking effects, especially\r\nagainst a house, high shrubbery, or other background. If they are\r\nplanted by themselves, they should be in clumps rather than scattered\r\nas single specimens, as the effect is better. See that they get a good\r\nstart before they are planted in the open ground. As soon as killed\r\ndown by frost, dig them, dry the roots of superfluous moisture, and\r\nstore till wanted in late winter or spring.\r\n\r\nCalceolaria.—The calceolarias are small greenhouse herbs sometimes used\r\nin the window-garden. They are not very satisfactory plants for window\r\ntreatment, however, since they suffer from dry atmosphere and from\r\nsudden changes of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe calceolarias are grown from seeds. If the seeds are sown in early\r\nsummer and the young plants are transplanted as they need, flowering\r\nspecimens may be had for the late fall and early winter. In the growing\r\nof the young plants, always avoid exposing them to direct sunlight; but\r\nthey should be given a place that has an abundance of screened or\r\ntempered light. A new crop of plants should be raised each year.\r\n\r\nThere is a race of shrubby calceolarias, but it is little known in this\r\ncountry. One or two species are annuals adaptable to cultivation in the\r\nopen garden, and their little ladyslipper-like flowers are attractive.\r\nHowever, they are of secondary importance as annual garden flowers.\r\n\r\nCalla (properly _Richardia_), Egyptian lily.—The calla is one of the\r\nmost satisfactory of winter house-plants, lending itself to various\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the calla are rich soil and an abundance of water,\r\nwith the roots confined in as small a space as possible. If a too large\r\npot is used, the growth of foliage will be very rank, at the expense of\r\nthe flowers; but by using a smaller-sized pot and applying liquid\r\nmanure, the flowers will be produced freely. A 6-inch pot will be large\r\nenough for all but an exceptionally large bulb or tuber. If desired, a\r\nnumber of tubers may be grown together in a larger pot. The soil should\r\nbe very rich but fibrous—at least one third well-rotted manure will be\r\nnone too much, mixed with equal parts of fibrous loam and sharp sand.\r\nThe tubers should be planted firmly and the pots set in a cool place to\r\nmake roots. After the roots have partially filled the pot, the plant\r\nmay be brought into heat and given a sunny position and an abundance of\r\nwater. An occasional sponging or washing of the leaves will free them\r\nfrom dust. No other treatment will be required until the flowers\r\nappear, when liquid manure may be given.The plant will thrive all the\r\nbetter at this time if the pot is placed in a saucer of water. In fact,\r\nthe calla will grow well in an aquarium.\r\n\r\nThe calla may be grown through the entire year, but it will prove more\r\nsatisfactory, both in leaf and flower, if rested through part of the\r\nsummer. This may be done by laying the pots on their sides in a dry\r\nshady place under shrubbery, or if in the open slightly covered with\r\nstraw or other litter to keep the roots from becoming extremely dry. In\r\nSeptember or October they may be shaken out, cleaning off all the old\r\nsoil, and repotted, as already mentioned. The offsets may be taken off\r\nand set in small pots and given a year’s growth, resting them the\r\nsecond year and having them in flower that winter.\r\n\r\nThe spotted calla has variegated foliage and is a good plant for mixed\r\ncollections. This blooms in the spring, which will lengthen the season\r\nof calla bloom. The treatment of this is similar to that of the common\r\ncalla.\r\n\r\nCamellias are half-hardy woody plants, blooming in late winter and\r\nspring. Years ago camellias were very popular, but they have been\r\ncrowded out by the informal flowers of recent times. Their time will\r\ncome again.\r\n\r\nDuring the blooming season keep them cool—say not over 50° at night and\r\na little higher by day. When blooming is done they begin to grow; then\r\ngive them more heat and plenty of water. See that they are well ripened\r\nby winter with large plump flower-buds. If they are neglected or kept\r\ntoo dry during their growing season (in summer) they will drop their\r\nbuds in fall. The soil for camellias should be fibrous and fertile,\r\ncompounded of rotted sod, leafmold, old cow manure, and sufficient sand\r\nfor good drainage. Always screen them from direct sunlight. Do not try\r\nto force them in early winter, after the growth has ceased. Their\r\nsummer quarters may be in a protected place in the open air.\r\n\r\nCamellias are propagated by cuttings in winter, which should give\r\nblooming plants in two years.\r\n\r\nCannas are among the most ornamental and important plants used in\r\ndecorative gardening. They make fine herbaceous hedges, groups, masses,\r\nand—when desirable—good center plants for beds. They are much used for\r\nsubtropical effects (see Plate V).\r\n\r\nCannas grow 3 to 10 feet or more high. Formerly they were valued\r\nchiefly for their foliage, but since the introduction, in 1884, of the\r\nCrozy Dwarf French type with its showy flowers, cannas are grown as\r\nmuch for their bloom as for their foliage effects. The flowers of these\r\nnew kinds are as large as those of gladioli, and are of various shades\r\nof yellow and red, with banded and spotted forms. These flowering kinds\r\ngrow about 3 feet high. The older forms are taller. In both sections\r\nthere are green-leaved and dark coppery-red-leaved varieties.\r\n\r\nThe canna may be grown from seed and had in bloom the first year by\r\nsowing in February or March, in boxes or pots placed in hotbeds or a\r\nwarm house, first soaking the seeds in warm water for a short time or\r\nfiling a small notch through the coat of each seed (avoiding the round\r\ngerminating point). It requires two years to raise strong plants of the\r\nold-fashioned tall cannas from seed. Sow in light, sandy soil, where\r\nthe earth may be kept at 70° till after germination. After the plants\r\nhave got well up, transplant them to about 3 or 4 inches apart, or\r\nplace in pots 3 inches wide, in good rich soil. They may now be kept at\r\n60°.\r\n\r\nThe majority of cannas, however, are grown from pieces of the roots\r\n(rhizomes), each piece having a bud. The roots may be divided at any\r\ntime in the winter, and if early flowers and foliage are wanted, the\r\npieces may be planted in a hotbed or warmhouse in early April, started\r\ninto growth, and planted out where wanted as soon as the ground has\r\nwarmed and all danger of frost is over. A hardening of the plants, by\r\nleaving the sash off the hotbeds, or setting the plants in shallow\r\nboxes and placing the boxes in a sheltered position through May, not\r\nforgetting a liberal supply of water, will fit the plants to take\r\nkindly to the final planting out.\r\n\r\nPlant out roots or started plants when there is no longer danger of\r\nfrost. For mass effects, the plants may stand twelve to eighteen inches\r\napart; for individual bloom twenty to twenty-four inches or more. Some\r\ngardeners plant them not closer than twenty to twenty-four inches for\r\nmass beds, if the soil is good and the plants strong. Give them a warm\r\nsunny place.\r\n\r\nThe old (foliage) sorts may be left out late to ripen up the fleshy\r\nroot-stocks. Cut the tops off immediately after frost. The roots are\r\nsafe in the ground as long as it does not freeze. Dig, and dry or\r\n“cure” for a few days, then winter them like potatoes in the cellar. It\r\nis a common mistake to dig canna roots too early.\r\n\r\nThe French sorts are commonly thought to keep best if kept growing\r\nsomewhat during the winter; but if managed right, they may be carried\r\nover like the others. Immediately after frost, cut off the tops next\r\nthe ground. Cover the stumps with a little soil and leave the roots in\r\nthe ground till well ripened. Clean them after digging, and cure or dry\r\nthem for a week or more in the open air and sun, taking them indoors at\r\nnight. Then place them away from frost in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nCarnations are now among the most popular florists’ flowers; but it is\r\nnot generally known that they be easily grown in the outdoor garden.\r\nThey are of two types, the outdoor or garden varieties, and the indoor\r\nor forcing kinds. Normally, the carnation is a hardy perennial, but the\r\ngarden kinds, or marguerites, are usually treated as annuals. The\r\nforcing kinds are flowered but once, new plants being grown each year\r\nfrom cuttings.\r\n\r\nMarguerite carnations bloom the year the seed is sown, and with a\r\nslight protection will bloom freely the second year. They make\r\nattractive house plants if potted in the fall. The seeds of these\r\ncarnations should be sown in boxes in March and the young plants set\r\nout as early as possible, pinching out the center of the plant to make\r\nthem branch freely. Give the same space as for garden pinks.\r\n\r\nThe winter-flowering carnations have become prime favorites with all\r\nflower lovers, and a collection of winter house-plants seems incomplete\r\nwithout them.\r\n\r\nCarnations grow readily from cuttings made of the suckers that form\r\naround the base of the stem, the side shoots of the flowering stem, or\r\nthe main shoots before they show flower-buds. The cuttings from the\r\nbase make the best plants in most cases. These cuttings may be taken\r\nfrom a plant at any time through the fall or winter, rooted in sand and\r\npotted up, to be held in pots until the planting out time in the\r\nspring, usually in April, or any time when the ground is ready to\r\nhandle. Care should be taken to pinch out the tops of the young plants\r\nwhile growing in the pot, and later while in the ground, causing them\r\nto grow stocky and send out new growths along the stem. The young\r\nplants should be grown cool, a temperature of 45° suiting them well.\r\nAttention should be given to spraying the cuttings each day while in\r\nthe house to keep down the red spider, which is very partial to the\r\ncarnation.\r\n\r\nIn the summer, the plants are grown in the field, and not in pots,\r\nbeing transplanted from the cutting-box. The soil in which they are to\r\nbe planted should be moderately rich and loose. Clean cultivation\r\nshould be given throughout the summer. Frequently pinch out the tops.\r\n\r\nThe plants are taken up in September and potted firmly, and well\r\nwatered; then set in a cool, partially shaded situation until root\r\ngrowth has started, and watering the plant as it shows need of water.\r\n\r\nThe usual living-room conditions as to moisture and heat are not such\r\nas the carnation demands, and care must be taken to overcome the\r\ndryness by spraying the foliage and setting the plant in a position not\r\nexposed to the direct heat of a stove or the sun. In commercial houses,\r\nit is not often necessary to spray established plants. Pick off most or\r\nall of the side buds, in order to add to the size of the leading\r\nflowers. After all is said, it is probably advisable in most cases to\r\npurchase the plants when in bloom from a florist, and after blooming\r\neither throw them away or store them for planting out in the spring,\r\nwhen they will bloom throughout the summer.\r\n\r\nIf conditions are right, the rust should not be very troublesome, if\r\nthe start was made with clean stock. Keep all rusted leaves picked off.\r\n\r\nCentury plants or agaves are popular plants for the window-garden or\r\nconservatory, requiring little care and growing slowly, thus needing\r\nrepotting only at long intervals. When the plants have outgrown their\r\nusefulness as house-plants, they are still valuable as porch\r\ndecorations, for plunging in rock-work, or about rustic nooks. The\r\nstriped-leaved variety is the most desirable, but the normal type, with\r\nits blue-gray leaves, is highly ornamental.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of dwarf species of agave that are not so common,\r\nalthough they may be grown with ease. Such plants add novelty to a\r\ncollection, and may be used through the summer as noted above or\r\nplunged with cactus in a bed of tropical plants. All succeed well in\r\nloam and sand in equal parts, with a little leafmold in the case of the\r\nsmall varieties.\r\n\r\nThe more common species are propagated by suckers from around the base\r\nof the established plants. A few kinds having no suckers must be grown\r\nfrom seed.\r\n\r\nAs to watering, they demand no special care. Agaves will not stand\r\nfrost to any extent.\r\n\r\nWhen the head throws up its great stem and blooms, it may exhaust\r\nitself and die; but this may be far short of a century. Some species\r\nbloom more than once.\r\n\r\nChrysanthemums are of many kinds, some being annual flower-garden\r\nplants, some perennial border subjects, and one form is the universal\r\nflorists’ plant. In chrysanthemums are now included the pyrethrums.\r\n\r\nThe annual chrysanthemums must not be confounded with the well-known\r\nfall-flowering kinds, as they will prove a disappointment if one\r\nexpects large flowers of all colors and shapes. The annuals are mostly\r\ncoarse-growing plants, with an abundance of bloom and a rank smell. The\r\nflowers are single in most cases, and not very lasting. They are useful\r\nfor massing and also for cut-flowers. They are among the easiest of\r\nhardy annuals to grow. The stoniest part of the garden will usually\r\nsuit them. Colors white and shades of yellow, the flowers daisy-like;\r\n1-3 ft.\r\n\r\nAmongst perennial kinds, _Chrysanthemum frutescens_ is the well-known\r\nParis daisy or marguerite, one of the most popular of the genus. This\r\nmakes a good pot-plant for the window-garden, blooming throughout the\r\nwinter and spring months. It is usually propagated by cuttings, which,\r\nif taken in spring, will give large blooming plants for the next\r\nwinter. Gradually transfer to larger pots or boxes, until the plants\r\nfinally stand in 6-inch or 8-inch pots or in small soap boxes. There is\r\na fine yellow-flowered variety. The marguerite daisy is much grown\r\nout-of-doors in California.\r\n\r\nThe hardy perennial kinds are small-flowered, late-blooming plants,\r\nknown to many old people as “artemisias.” They have been improved of\r\nlate years, and they are very satisfactory plants of easy culture. The\r\nplants should be renewed from seed every year or two.\r\n\r\nIn variety of form and color, and in size of bloom, the florists’\r\nchrysanthemum is one of the most wonderful of plants. It is a late\r\nautumn flower, and it needs little artificial heat to bring it to\r\nperfection. The great blooms of the exhibitions are produced by growing\r\nonly one flower to a plant and by feeding the plant heavily. It is\r\nhardly possible for the amateur to grow such specimen flowers as the\r\nprofessional florist or gardener does; neither is it necessary. A\r\nwell-grown plant with fourteen to twenty flowers is far more\r\nsatisfactory as a window-plant than a long, stiff stem with only one\r\nimmense flower at the apex. The culture is simple, much more so than\r\nthat of many of the plants commonly grown for house decoration.\r\nAlthough the season of bloom is short, the satisfaction of having a\r\nfall display of flowers before the geraniums, begonias, and other\r\nhouse-plants have recovered from their removal from out of doors,\r\nrepays all efforts. Very good plants can be grown under a temporary\r\nshed cover, as shown in Fig. 268. The roof need not necessarily be of\r\nglass. Under such a cover, also, potted plants, in bloom, may be set\r\nfor protection when the weather becomes too cold.\r\n\r\nCuttings taken in March or April, planted out in the border in May,\r\nwell tended through the summer and lifted before frost in September,\r\nwill bloom in October or November. The ground in which the plants are\r\nto bloom should be moderately rich and moist. The plants may be tied to\r\nstakes. When the buds show, all but the center one of each cluster on\r\nthe leading shoots should be picked off, as also the small lateral\r\nbranches. A thrifty bushy plant thus treated will usually have flowers\r\nlarge enough to show the character of the variety, also numbers enough\r\nto make a fine display.\r\n\r\nAfter blooming, the plants are lifted from the border. As to the\r\nreceptacle into which to put them, it need not be a flower-pot. A pail\r\nor soap-box, with holes bored for drainage, will suit the plant just as\r\nwell, and by covering the box with cloth or paper the difference will\r\nnot be noticed.\r\n\r\nIf cuttings are not to be had, young plants may be bought of the\r\nflorists and treated in the manner described. Buy them in midsummer or\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nIt is best not to attempt to flower the same plant two seasons. After\r\nthe plant has bloomed, the top may be cut down, and the box set in a\r\ncellar and kept moderately dry. In February or March, bring the plant\r\nto the sitting-room window and let the shoots start from the root.\r\nThese shoots are taken for cuttings to grow plants for the fall bloom.\r\n\r\nCineraria is a tender greenhouse subject, but it may be grown as a\r\nhouse-plant, although the conditions necessary to the best results are\r\ndifficult to secure outside a glasshouse.\r\n\r\nThe conditions for cinerarias are a cool temperature, frequent\r\nrepotting, and guarding against the attacks of the greenfly. Perhaps\r\nthe last is the most difficult, and with one having no facilities for\r\nfumigating, it will be almost impossible to prevent the difficulty. A\r\nliving room usually has too dry air for cinerarias.\r\n\r\nThe seed, which is very minute, should be sown in August or September\r\nto have plants in bloom in January or February. Sow the seed on the\r\nsurface of fine soil and water very lightly to settle the seeds into\r\nthe soil. A piece of glass or a damp cloth may be spread over the pot\r\nor box in which the seeds are sown, to remain until the seeds are up.\r\nAlways keep the soil damp, but not wet. When the seedlings are large\r\nenough to repot, they should be potted singly in 2-or 3-inch pots.\r\nBefore the plants have become pot-bound, they should again be repotted\r\ninto larger pots, until they are in at least 6-inch pots in which to\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\nIn all this time, they should be grown cool and, if not possible to\r\nfumigate them with tobacco, the pots should stand on tobacco stems,\r\nwhich should be moist at all times. The general practice, in order to\r\nhave bushy plants, is to pinch out the center when the flower-buds\r\nshow, causing the lateral branches to start, which they are slow to do\r\nif the central stem is allowed to grow. Plants bloom but once.\r\n\r\nClematis.—One of the best of woody climbing vines, the common _C.\r\nFlammula, Virginiana, paniculata_ and others being used frequently to\r\ncover division walls or fences, growing year after year without any\r\ncare and producing quantities of flowers. _C. paniculata_ is now\r\nplanted very extensively. The panicles of star-shaped flowers entirely\r\ncover the vine and have a pleasant fragrance. It is one of the best of\r\nall fall-flowering vines, and hardy north; clings well to a\r\nchicken-wire trellis.\r\n\r\nThe large-flowered section, of which Jackmani is perhaps the best\r\nknown, is very popular for pillar or porch climbers. The flowers of\r\nthis section are large and showy, running from pure white, through\r\nblue, to scarlet. Of this class, a serviceable purple is Jackmani;\r\nwhite, Henryi (Fig. 266); blue, Ramona; crimson, Madame E. André.\r\n\r\nA deep, mellow, fertile soil, naturally moist, will suit the\r\nrequirements of clematis. In dry times apply water freely, particularly\r\nfor the large-flowered kinds. Also provide trellis or other support as\r\nsoon as they begin to run. Clematis usually blooms on the wood of the\r\nseason: therefore prune in winter or early spring, in order to secure\r\nstrong new flowering shoots. The large-flowered kinds should be cut\r\nback to the ground each year; some other kinds may be similarly treated\r\nunless they are wanted for permanent bowers.\r\n\r\nThe clematis root disease is the depredation of a nematode or eel-worm.\r\nIt is seldom troublesome in ground that thoroughly freezes, and this\r\nmay be the reason why it so often fails when planted against buildings.\r\n\r\nColeus.—The commonest “foliage plant” in window-gardens. It was used\r\nvery extensively at one time in ornamental bedding and ribbon borders,\r\nbut owing to its being tender has lost in favor, and its place is\r\nlargely taken by other plants.\r\n\r\nColeus is grown with the greatest ease from cuttings or slips. Take\r\ncuttings only from vigorous and healthy plants. It may also be grown\r\nfrom seed, although the types have not become fixed, and a large number\r\nof differently marked plants may be had from the same packet. This\r\nwould not be a drawback in the window-garden, unless a uniform effect\r\nis desired; in fact, the best results are often secured from seeds. Sow\r\nthe seed in gentle heat in March.\r\n\r\nGrow new plants each year, and throw the old ones away.\r\n\r\nCrocus (see _Bulbs_).—Crocus is one of the best of spring bulbs, easily\r\ngrown and giving good satisfaction either in the border or scattered\r\nthrough the lawn. They are also forced for winter (see p. 345). They\r\nare so cheap and lasting that they may be used in quantity. A border of\r\ncrocuses along the edges of walks, little clumps of them in the lawn,\r\nor masses in a bed, give the first touch of color as the spring opens.\r\n\r\nA sandy soil suits the crocus admirably. Plant in the fall, in the\r\nopen, 3 to 4 inches deep. When they show signs of failing, take up the\r\nbulbs and reset them. They tend to rise out of the ground, because the\r\nnew bulb or corm forms on the top of the old one. They run out on lawns\r\nin two or three years. If best results are desired, it is well to renew\r\nthe bed occasionally by buying new bulbs. Crocus beds may be filled\r\nlater in the season with quick-growing annuals. It is important that\r\nonly the best flowering bulbs be secured.\r\n\r\nThey may be forced with ease, planted in pots or shallow boxes, put\r\naway in a cool place and brought into the house at any time through the\r\nwinter. A low temperature will bring them into bloom in perfection in\r\nabout four weeks from the time they are brought in. They can be had in\r\nthe window-garden in this way, opening in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nCroton.—Under this name many varieties and so-called species of Codiæum\r\nare grown for conservatory decoration, and latterly for foliage bedding\r\nin the open. The colors and shapes of the leaves are very various and\r\nattractive. The crotons make good window-garden subjects, although they\r\nare very liable to the attack of the mealy bug.\r\n\r\nThe plants should be given an abundance of light in order to bring out\r\ntheir fine colors; but it is usually advisable to screen them from the\r\ndirect rays of the sun when they are grown under glass. If the red\r\nspider or the mealy bug attack them, they may be syringed with tobacco\r\nwater. Plants that are propagated indoors in winter may be massed in\r\nbeds out of doors in summer, where they make very striking effects.\r\nGive them strong deep soil, and be sure that they are syringed\r\nfrequently enough on the underside of the leaves to keep down the red\r\nspider. If the plants have been gradually subjected to strong light\r\nbefore they are taken out of doors, they will stand the full sunlight\r\nand will develop their rich colors to perfection. In the fall they may\r\nbe taken up, cut back, and used for window-garden or conservatory\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nCrotons are shrubs or small trees, and they may be transferred into\r\nlarge pots or tubs and grown into large tree-like specimens. Old and\r\nscraggly specimens should be thrown away.\r\n\r\nCrotons are propagated readily by cuttings of half-ripened wood any\r\ntime in winter or spring.\r\n\r\nCyclamen.—A tender greenhouse tuberous plant, sometimes seen in the\r\nwindow-garden. The Persian cyclamen is best for the house-gardener to\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\nCyclamens may be grown from seed sown in April or September in soil\r\ncontaining a large proportion of sand and leafmold. If sown in\r\nSeptember, they should be wintered in a coolhouse. In May they should\r\nbe potted into larger pots and placed in a shaded frame, and by July\r\nwill have become large enough for their flowering pot, which should be\r\neither 5-inch or 6-inch. They should be brought into the house before\r\ndanger of frost, and grown cool until through flowering. A temperature\r\nof 55° suits them while in flower. After flowering, they will need a\r\nrest for a short time, but should not become very dry, or the bulb will\r\nbe injured. When they start into growth, they should have the old soil\r\nshaken off and be potted into smaller pots. At no time should more than\r\nhalf the tuber be under the soil.\r\n\r\nApril-sown plants should be similarly treated. Cyclamens should bloom\r\nin about fifteen months from seed. The seed germinates very slowly.\r\n\r\nTubers large enough to flower the first year may be purchased from the\r\nseedsmen at moderate prices; and unless one has facilities for growing\r\nthe seedlings for a year, purchase of the tubers will give the best\r\nsatisfaction. Secure new tubers, for old ones are not so good.\r\n\r\nThe soil best suited to the cyclamen is one containing two parts\r\nleafmold, one part each of sand and loam.\r\n\r\nDahlia is an old favorite which, on account of its formal flowers, has\r\nbeen in disfavor for a few years, although it has always held a place\r\nin the rural districts. Now, however, with the advent of the cactus and\r\nsemi-cactus types (or loose-flowered forms), and the improvement of the\r\nsingles, it again has taken a front rank among late summer flowers,\r\ncoming in just in advance of the chrysanthemum.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. Cornflower or bachelor’s button. _Centaurea Cyanus_. XVIII.\r\nCornflower or bachelor’s button. _Centaurea Cyanus_.\r\n\r\nThe single varieties may be grown from seed, but the double sorts\r\nshould be grown from cuttings of young stems or from division of the\r\nroots. If cuttings are to be made, it will be necessary to start the\r\nroots early, either in a hotbed or house. When the growths have reached\r\n4 or 5 inches, they may be cut from the plant and rooted in sand. Care\r\nshould be taken to cut just below a joint, as a cutting made between\r\ntwo joints will not form tubers. The most rapid method of propagation\r\nof named varieties is to grow from cuttings in this way.\r\n\r\nIn growing the plants from roots, the best plan is to place the whole\r\nroot in gentle heat, covering slightly. When the young growth has\r\nstarted, the roots may be taken up, divided, and planted out 3 to 4\r\nfeet apart. This plan will insure a plant from each piece of root,\r\nwhereas if the roots are divided while dormant, there is danger of not\r\nhaving a bud at the end of each piece, in which case no growth will\r\nstart; the roots are sometimes cut into pieces while dormant, however,\r\nbut one should be sure that a piece of old stem with bud is on each\r\npiece.\r\n\r\nOne objection to the old dahlia was its lateness of bloom. But by\r\nstarting the roots early in a frame, or in boxes that are covered at\r\nnight, the plants may be had in flower several weeks earlier than\r\nusual. They may be started in April, or at least three weeks in advance\r\nof planting time. Little water will be required till they start. When\r\nthey begin shooting up, the plants should have the full sun, and air,\r\non all mild days. They will then make a slow, sturdy growth. All\r\nforcing should be avoided. These plants, set out when there is no\r\nlonger danger of frost, and well watered before completely covering the\r\nroots, will grow right on, and often begin blooming in July.\r\n\r\nDormant roots may be set out in May. The roots, unless small, should be\r\ndivided before planting, as a single strong root is usually better than\r\na whole clump. The roots of all but the Dwarf should be set about 3\r\nfeet apart, in rows. In poor soils none but the first class will need\r\nstakes.\r\n\r\nThe dahlia flourishes best in a deep, loose, moist soil; very good\r\nresults can be had on sandy soil, provided plant-food and moisture are\r\nfurnished. Clay should be avoided. If the ground is too strong, they\r\nwill probably bloom too late for the northern latitudes.\r\n\r\nIf the plants are to be grown without stakes, the center of each plant\r\nshould be pinched out after making two or three joints. By doing this\r\nthe lateral branches will start near the ground and be stiff enough to\r\nwithstand the winds. In most home gardens the plants are allowed to\r\nreach their full height, and are tied to stakes if necessary. The tall\r\nkinds reach a height of 5 to 8 ft.\r\n\r\nDahlias are very susceptible to frost. After the first frost, lift the\r\nroots, let them dry in the sun, shake off the dirt, trim off tops and\r\nbroken parts, and store them in a cellar, as for potatoes. They may be\r\nplaced in barrels of sand, if the open cellar is not usable. Cannas may\r\nbe stored in the same place.\r\n\r\nThe tree dahlia (_D. excelsa_, but cultivated as _D. arborea_) is grown\r\nmore or less far South and in California. It has not been much\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nFerns.—The native ferns transplant easily to the garden, and they make\r\nan attractive addition to the side of a house, or as an admixture in a\r\nhardy border. The ostrich, cinnamon, and royal ferns are the best\r\nsubjects. Give all outdoor ferns a place that is protected from winds,\r\notherwise they will shrivel and perhaps die. Screen them from the hot\r\nsun, or give them the shady side of the building. See that the soil is\r\nuniformly moist, and that it does not get too hot. Mulch with leafmold\r\nin the fall. It is not difficult to colonize many of the native ferns\r\nin shady and protected places where trees do not sap all the strength\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\nProbably the one fern grown most extensively as a house-plant is the\r\nsmall-leaved maidenhair fern (or _Adiantum gracillimum_). This and\r\nother species are among the finest of house plants, when sufficient\r\nmoisture can be given. They make fine specimens as well as serving the\r\npurpose of greenery for cut flowers. Other species often grown for\r\nhouse plants are _A. cuneatum_ and _A. Capillus-Veneris._ All these do\r\nwell in a mixture of fibrous sod, loam, and sand, with ample drainage\r\nmaterial. They may be divided if an increase is wanted.\r\n\r\nAnother fern for house culture is _Nephrolepsis exaltata_. This is no\r\ndoubt the most easily grown of the list, flourishing in a sitting-room.\r\nA variety of _N. exaltata_, called the Boston fern, is a decided\r\naddition to this group, having a drooping habit, covering the pot and\r\nmaking a fine stand or bracket plant; and there are now several other\r\nforms of it suitable for the best window-gardens.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of pteris, especially _P. serrulata_, are valuable\r\nhouse ferns but require a warmer place than those mentioned above. They\r\nwill also thrive better in a shady or ill-lighted corner.\r\n\r\nPerfect drainage and care in watering have more to do with the\r\nsuccessful growing of ferns than any special mixture of soils. If the\r\ndrainage material in the bottom of the pot or box is sufficient, there\r\nis little danger of overwatering; but water-logged soil is always to be\r\navoided. Do not use clay soils. Ferns need protection from the direct\r\nsunshine, and also a moist atmosphere. They thrive well in a close\r\nglass box, or window-garden, if the conditions can be kept equable.\r\n\r\nFreesia.—One of the best and most easily handled tender\r\nwinter-flowering bulbs; height 12 or 15 inches. The white form\r\n_(Freesia refracta alba_) is the best.\r\n\r\nThe white or yellowish bell-shaped flowers of freesia are produced on\r\nslender stalks just above the foliage, to the number of six to eight in\r\na cluster. They are very fragrant, and last for a considerable time\r\nwhen picked. The bulbs are small, and look as though they could not\r\nproduce a growth of foliage and flowers, but even the smallest mature\r\nbulb will prove satisfactory. Several bulbs should be planted together\r\nin a pot, box, or pan, in October, if wanted for the holidays, or later\r\nif wanted at Easter. The plants bloom from ten to twelve weeks from\r\nplanting, under ordinary care.\r\n\r\nNo special treatment is required; keep the plants cool and moist\r\nthrough the growing season. The soil should contain a little sand mixed\r\nwith fibrous loam, and the pot should be well drained. After flowering,\r\ngradually withhold water and the tops will die down, after which the\r\nroots may be shaken out and rested until time to plant in fall. Care\r\nshould be taken to keep them perfectly dry.\r\n\r\nThe bulbs increase rapidly from offsets. Plants may also be grown from\r\nseed, which should be sown as soon as ripe, giving blooming plants the\r\nsecond or third year.\r\n\r\nFuchsia.—Well-known window or greenhouse shrub, treated as an\r\nherbaceous subject; many interesting forms; late winter, spring and\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nFuchsia is readily grown from cuttings. Soft green wood should be used\r\nfor cuttings, and it will root in about three weeks, when the cuttings\r\nshould be potted. Take care not to have them pot-bound while in growth,\r\nbut do not overpot when bloom is wanted. Given warmth and good soil,\r\nthey will make fine plants in three months or less. In well-protected,\r\npartially shady places they may be planted out, growing into miniature\r\nbushes by fall.\r\n\r\nPlants may be kept on from year to year; and if the branches are well\r\ncut back after blooming, abundant new bloom will come. But it is\r\nusually best to make new plants each year from cuttings, since young\r\nplants commonly bloom most profusely and demand less care. Fuchsias are\r\namongst the best of window subjects.\r\n\r\nGeranium.—What are commonly known as geraniums are, strictly speaking,\r\npelargoniums. (See _Pelargonium_.)\r\n\r\nThe true geraniums are mostly hardy perennials, and therefore should\r\nnot be confounded with the tender pelargoniums. Geraniums are worthy a\r\nplace in a border. They may be transplanted early in the spring,\r\nsetting them 2 ft. apart. Height 10 to 12 in. The common wild\r\ncranesbill _(Geranium maculatum_) improves under cultivation, and is an\r\nattractive plant when it stands in front of taller foliage.\r\n\r\nGladiolus.—Of summer and fall-blooming bulbous plants, gladiolus is\r\nprobably the most widely popular. The colors range from scarlet and\r\npurple, to white, rose, and pure yellow. The plants are of slender,\r\nerect habit, growing from 2 to 3 feet high.\r\n\r\nGladioli dislike a heavy clay soil. A light loam or sandy soil suits\r\nthem best. No fresh manure should be added to the soil the year in\r\nwhich they are grown. They should have a new place every year, if\r\npossible, and always an open sunny situation.\r\n\r\nThe corms may be covered 2 inches deep in heavy soils, and 4 to 6 in\r\nlight soils. They may stand 8 to 10 inches apart, or half this distance\r\nfor mass effects. For a succession, they may be planted at short\r\nintervals, the earliest planting being of smaller corms in the early\r\nspring as soon as the soil is dry enough to work; later the larger are\r\nto be planted—the last setting being not later than the Fourth of July.\r\nThis last planting will afford fine late flowers. The plants should be\r\nsupported by inconspicuous stakes.\r\n\r\nThe successive plantings may be in the same bed among those set\r\nearlier, or they may be grouped in unoccupied nooks, or portions of the\r\nborder. The plants may stand as close as 6 inches from each other. The\r\nearlier planting may be a foot apart to admit of later settings\r\nbetween.\r\n\r\nLate in the fall, after frosts and before freezing, the corms are to be\r\ndug, cleaned, and dried in the sun and air for a few hours and then\r\nstored away in boxes about 2-1/2 inches deep in a cool, dark, and dry\r\nplace. The tops should be left on, at least till completely shriveled.\r\nThe varieties are perpetuated and multiplied by the little corms that\r\nappear about the base of the large new corm which is formed each year.\r\nThese small corms may be taken off in the spring and sown thickly in\r\ndrills. Many of them will make flowering plants by the second season.\r\nThey are treated like the large corms, in the fall.\r\n\r\nGladioli are easily grown from seed also, but this method cannot be\r\ndepended on to perpetuate desirable varieties, which can be reproduced\r\nonly by the cormels. Some of the best flowers may be cross-pollinated,\r\nor allowed to form seed in the usual manner; the seed sown thickly in\r\ndrills, and shaded till the plantlets appear, then carefully\r\ncultivated, will afford a crop of small corms in the fall. These may be\r\nstored for the winter, like the other young corms, and, like them, many\r\nwill flower the second season, affording a great variety and quite\r\nlikely some new and striking kinds. Those that do not flower should be\r\nreserved for further trial. They often prove finer than those first to\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nEarly-flowering varieties of gladioli may be forced for late winter or\r\nspring bloom.\r\n\r\nFor bouquets, cut the spike when the lower flowers open; keep in fresh\r\nwater, cut off the end of the stem frequently, and the other flowers\r\nwill expand.\r\n\r\nGloxinia.—Choice greenhouse tuberous-rooted, spring and summer-blooming\r\nperennials, sometimes seen in window-gardens, but really not adapted to\r\nthem, although some skillful house-gardeners grow them successfully.\r\n\r\nGloxinias must have a uniform moist and warm atmosphere and protection\r\nfrom the sun. They will not stand abuse or varying conditions.\r\nPropagated often by leaf-cuttings, which should give flowering plants\r\nin one year. From the leaf, inserted half its length in the soil (or\r\nsometimes only the petiole inserted) a tuber arises. This tuber, after\r\nresting until midwinter or later, is planted, and flowering plants soon\r\narise.\r\n\r\nGloxinias also grow readily from seeds, which may be germinated in a\r\ntemperature of about 70°. Flowering plants may be had in August if\r\nseeds are sown in late winter, say in early February. This is the usual\r\nmethod. After the bloom is past, the tuber is partially dried off and\r\nkept dormant till the following season. It will usually show signs of\r\nactivity in February or March, when it may be shaken out of the old\r\nearth and a little water may then be applied and the amount increased\r\ntill the plant is in bloom. The same tubers may be bloomed several\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the growing of gloxinias is largely a matter of proper\r\nwatering. Keep the dormant tuber just dry enough to prevent shriveling,\r\nnever trying to force it ahead of its time. Avoid wetting the leaves.\r\nProtect from direct sunlight. Protect from draughts on the plants.\r\n\r\nGrevillea.—The “she oak,” very graceful greenhouse plant, suitable also\r\nfor house culture. The plants grow freely from seed, and until they\r\nbecome too large are as decorative as ferns. Grevilleas are really\r\ntrees, and are valuable in greenhouses and rooms only in their young\r\nstate. They withstand much abuse. They are now very popular as\r\njardinière subjects. Seeds sown in spring will give handsome plants by\r\nthe next winter. Discard the plants as soon as they become ragged.\r\n\r\nHollyhocks.—These old garden favorites have been neglected of late\r\nyears, primarily because the hollyhock rust has been so prevalent,\r\ndestroying the plants or making them unsightly.\r\n\r\nTheir culture is very simple. The seed is usually sown in July or\r\nAugust, and the plants set where wanted the following spring. They will\r\nbloom the same year in which they are transplanted—the year following\r\nthe seed-sowing. New plants should be set every two years, as the old\r\ncrowns are likely to rot or die after the first flowering, or at least\r\nto become weak.\r\n\r\nHyacinths (see _Bulbs_) are popular spring-flowering bulbs. Hyacinths\r\nare hardy, but they are often used as window or greenhouse plants. They\r\nare easy to grow and very satisfactory (Fig. 262).\r\n\r\nFor winter flowering, the bulbs should be procured early in the fall,\r\npotted in October in soil composed of loam, leafmold, and sand. If\r\nordinary flower-pots are used, put in the bottom a few pieces of broken\r\npots, charcoal, or small stones for drainage; then fill the pot with\r\ndirt, so that when the bulb is planted, the top will be on a level with\r\nthe rim of the pot. Fill in around the bulb with soil, leaving just the\r\ntip showing. These pots of bulbs should be placed in a cold pit, cellar\r\nor on the shady side of a building. In all cases, plunge the pot in\r\nsome cool material (as cinders). Before the weather becomes cold enough\r\nto freeze a crust on the ground, the pots should have a protection of\r\nstraw or leaves to keep the bulbs from severe freezing. In about six to\r\neight weeks the bulbs should have made roots enough to grow the plant,\r\nand the pots may be placed in a cool room for a short time. When the\r\nplants have started into growth, they may be placed in a warmer\r\nsituation. Watering should be carefully attended to from this time, and\r\nwhen the plant is in bloom, the pot may be set in a saucer or other\r\nshallow dish containing water. After flowering, the bulbs may be\r\nripened by gradually withholding water until the leaves die. They may\r\nthen be planted out in the border, where they will bloom each spring\r\nfor a number of years, but will never prove satisfactory for forcing\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe open-ground culture of hyacinths is the same as for tulips and\r\nother Holland bulbs.\r\n\r\nThe hyacinth is the most popular of the Dutch bulbs for growing in\r\nvases of water. The narcissus may be grown in water, and do just as\r\nwell, but it is not as attractive in glasses as the hyacinth. Glasses\r\nfor hyacinths may be had of florists who deal in supplies, and in\r\nvarious shapes and colors. The usual form is tall and narrow, with a\r\ncup-like mouth to receive the bulb. They are filled with water, so that\r\nit will just reach the base of the bulb when placed in position in the\r\ncup or shoulder above. The vessels of dark-colored glass are preferable\r\nto those of clear glass, as roots prefer darkness. When the glasses\r\nhave been filled, they are set away in a cool, dark place, where roots\r\nwill form, as in potted bulbs. Results are usually secured earlier in\r\nwater than in soil. To keep the water sweet, a few lumps of charcoal\r\nmay be put in the glass. As the water evaporates, add fresh; add enough\r\nso that it runs over, and thereby renews that in the glass. Do not\r\ndisturb the roots by taking out the bulb.\r\n\r\nIris includes many handsome perennials, of which the blue flag is\r\nfamiliar to every old-fashioned garden. They are favorites everywhere,\r\nfor their brilliant spring and summer bloom; and they are easy to grow.\r\n\r\nMost irises thrive best in a rather moist soil, and some of them may be\r\ncolonized in the water in margins of ponds.\r\n\r\nGardeners usually divide them into two sections—the tuberous-rooted or\r\nrhizomatous, and the bulbous. A third division—the fibrous-rooted—is\r\nsometimes made.\r\n\r\nThe common and most serviceable species belong to the tuberous-rooted\r\nsection. Here is the beautiful and varied Japanese iris, _Iris\r\nlœvigata_ (or _I. Kœmpferi_), which is among the most deserving of all\r\nhardy perennials. Most of these irises need no special care. They are\r\npropagated by division of the rootstocks. Plant the pieces one foot\r\napart if a mass effect is desired. When the plants begin to fail, dig\r\nthem up, divide the roots, discard the old parts, and grow a new stock,\r\nas before. The Japanese iris needs much water and a very rich soil.\r\nReadily grown from seeds, giving bloom the second year. _I Susiana_, of\r\nthis section, is one of the oddest of irises, but it is not quite hardy\r\nin the North.\r\n\r\nOf the bulbous section, most species are not hardy far North. The bulbs\r\nshould be taken up and replanted every two or three years. The Persian\r\nand Spanish irises belong here. The bulbs give rise to but a single\r\nstem.\r\n\r\nLily.—Under this name are included bulbous plants of many kinds, not\r\nall of them being true lilies. It has been said of this family of\r\nplants that it has no “poor relations,” each of them being perfect in\r\nitself. Many of the choicest kinds are comparatively unknown, although\r\neasy to cultivate. In fact, all of the lilies may be grown with\r\ncomparative ease in regions where the given species are hardy.\r\n\r\nA light, fertile, well-drained soil, mellow to the depth of at least\r\none foot, a handful of sand under each bulb if the soil is inclined to\r\nbe stiff, and planting so that the crown of the bulb will be at least 4\r\ninches below the surface, are the general requirements. One exception\r\nto the depth of planting is _Lilium auratum_, or golden-banded lily.\r\nThis should be planted deeper—from 8 to 12 inches below the surface—as\r\nthe new bulbs form over the old one and soon bring the bulbs to the\r\nsurface if they are not planted deep. Deep working of the ground is\r\nalways desirable; 18 inches, or even 2 feet, will be none too deep. _L.\r\ncandidum_ and _L. testaceum_ should be planted in August or September,\r\nif possible; but usually lilies are planted in October and November.\r\n\r\nFor all lilies it is safer to provide good winter protection in the\r\nform of a mulch of leaves or manure, and extending beyond the borders\r\nof the planting. This should be 5 inches to a foot deep, according to\r\nthe latitude or locality.\r\n\r\nWhile most lilies profit by partial shade (except _L. candidum_), they\r\nshould never be planted near or under trees. The shade or protection of\r\ntall-growing herbaceous plants is sufficient. In fact, the best\r\nresults, both as to growth and effect, may be secured by planting\r\namongst low shrubbery or border plants.\r\n\r\nMost kinds are the better for remaining undisturbed for a number of\r\nyears; but if they are to be taken up and divided, or moved to other\r\nquarters, they should not be allowed to become dry. The small bulbs, or\r\noffsets, may be planted in the border, and if protected, will grow to\r\nflowering size in two or three years. In taking up bulbs for division\r\nit is best to do so soon after the tops die after blooming. At least\r\nthis should be done early in the fall, not later than October, giving\r\nthe plants a chance to become established before freezing weather.\r\n\r\nAs pot-plants some kinds of lilies are very satisfactory, especially\r\nthose that may be forced into bloom through the winter. The best kinds\r\nfor this purpose are _L. Harrisii_ (Easter lily), _L. longiflorum_, and\r\n_L. candidum_. Others may be forced with success, but these are the\r\nones most generally used. The winter culture for forcing is practically\r\nthe same as for hyacinths in pots.\r\n\r\nSome of the best kinds of lilies are mentioned below:—\r\n\r\n_L. candidum_ (Annunciation lily). White; 3 to 4 feet high; it makes an\r\nautumn growth, and should, therefore, be planted in August; set the\r\nbulbs from 4 to 6 inches deep.\r\n\r\n_L. speciosum_ (_L. lancifolium_), var. _prœcox_. White, tinged with\r\npink; bears several flowers on a stem about 3 feet high.\r\n\r\n_L. speciosum_, var. _rubrum_. Rose color, spotted with red.\r\n\r\n_L. Brownii_. Flowers white inside, chocolate-colored outside; the\r\nstems grow about 3 feet high, bearing from 2 to 4 tubular flowers; not\r\ndifficult to manage with good protection and drainage; the bulbs are\r\nimpatient of being kept long out of the ground; after planting, they\r\nshould not be disturbed as long as they flower well.\r\n\r\n_L. maculatum (L. Hansoni)_. Dark yellow; stems 3-4 feet high, each\r\nproducing 6 to 12 flowers.\r\n\r\n_L. testaceum (L. excelsum, L. Isabellinum)_. Rich buff color, with\r\ndelicate spots; plants about 3 to 5 feet high, with 3 to a dozen\r\nflowers on a stem; plant the bulbs in September.\r\n\r\n_L. longiflorum_. White; large tubular flowers, 2 to 8 on a stem;\r\nheight, about 2-1/2 feet.\r\n\r\n_L. Batemanniae_ (a form of _L. elegans_). Apricot yellow; 6 to 12\r\nflowers on stems 3 to 4 feet high.\r\n\r\n_L. auratum_ (Japanese gold-banded lily). Immense white flowers banded\r\nwith yellow and dotted with red or purple, from 3 to 12 on a stem;\r\nheight, 3 to 4 feet; the bulbs need thorough protection, good drainage,\r\nand should be planted 10 or 12 inches deep (Fig. 258).\r\n\r\n_L. tigrinum_ (Tiger lily). An old favorite, with many drooping bright\r\nred spotted flowers; var. _splendens_ is specially good; 3 to 5 ft.\r\n\r\n_L. tenuifolium_. Rich scarlet flowers nodding in a raceme or panicle;\r\n1-1/2 to 2 ft.\r\n\r\n_L. Maximowiczii (L. Leichtlinii)_. Flowers clear yellow, with small,\r\ndark spots, 10 to 12 on a stem; height, 4 feet.\r\n\r\n_L. monadelphum_. Yellow tubular-shaped flowers in clusters of 6 to a\r\ndozen or more; stems 2-1/2 feet tall.\r\n\r\n_L. elegans (L. Thunbergianum_), var. _Alice Wilson_. Lemon-yellow;\r\nstems 2 feet high, bearing 2 to 8 flowers.\r\n\r\n_L. elegans_, var. _fulgens atrosanguineum_. Dark crimson; height, 1\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nLily-of-the-valley.—A perfectly hardy little perennial, bearing racemes\r\nof small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring; and also much\r\nforced by florists.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary cultivation, sods or mats of roots may be dug from any\r\nplace in which the plant is colonized. Usually it thrives best in\r\npartial shade; and the leaves make an attractive mat on the north side\r\nof a building, or other shady place, in which grass will not grow. The\r\nplants will take care of themselves year after year. Better results may\r\nbe expected from good commercial roots. The “pips” may be planted any\r\ntime from November on, from 3 to 6 inches apart.\r\n\r\nFor forcing indoors, imported roots or “pips” are used, as the plants\r\nare grown for this particular purpose in parts of Europe. These roots\r\nmay be planted in pots, and treated as recommended for winter-flowering\r\nbulbs. Florists force them in greater heat, however, often giving them\r\na bottom heat of 80° or 90°; but skill and experience are required in\r\norder to attain uniformly good results in this case.\r\n\r\nMignonette.—Probably no flower is more generally grown for its\r\nfragrance than the mignonette. It is a half-hardy annual, thriving\r\neither in the open or under glass.\r\n\r\nThe mignonette needs a cool soil, only moderately rich, shade part of\r\nthe day, and careful attention to cutting the flower-stalks before the\r\nseeds are ripe. If a sowing be made in late April, followed by a second\r\nsowing in early July, the season may be extended until severe frosts.\r\nThere are few flowers that will prove as disappointing if the simple\r\ntreatment it needs is omitted. Height, 1 to 2 feet.\r\n\r\nIt may be sown in pots late in summer and be had in the house in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nMoon-flowers are species of the morning-glory family that open their\r\nflowers at night. A well-grown plant trained over a porch trellis, or\r\nallowed to grow at random over a low tree or shrub, is a striking\r\nobject when in full flower at dusk or through a moonlit evening. In the\r\nSouthern states (where it is much grown) the moon-flower is a\r\nperennial, but even when well protected does not survive the winters in\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nCuttings usually give best results in the Northern states, as the\r\nseasons are not long enough for seed plants to give good bloom.\r\nCuttings may be made before danger of frost and wintered in the house,\r\nor the plants may be grown from seed sown in January or February. Seeds\r\nshould be scalded or filed just before sowing.\r\n\r\nThe true moon-flower is _Ipomœa Bona-Nox_ white-flowered; but there are\r\nother kinds that go under this name. This grows 20 to 30 feet where the\r\nseasons are long enough.\r\n\r\nNarcissus (see _Bulbs_).—Daffodils, jonquils, and the poet’s narcissus\r\nall belong to this group, and many of them are perfectly hardy. The\r\npolyanthus section, which includes the Paper-white narcissus and sacred\r\nlily or Chinese joss-flower, are not hardy except with unusually good\r\nprotection, and are, therefore, most suitable for growing indoors.\r\n\r\nIt is common to allow the hardy sorts to take care of themselves when\r\nonce planted. This they will do, but much more satisfactory results\r\nwill be had by lifting and dividing the clumps every three or four\r\nyears. A single bulb in a few years forms a large clump. In this\r\ncondition the bulbs are not properly nourished, and consequently do not\r\nflower well. Lifting is preferably done in August or September, when\r\nthe foliage has died down and the bulbs are ripe.\r\n\r\nThe narcissi are well suited to partially shaded places, and will grow\r\nand please wherever good taste may place them. They should be freely\r\nused, as they are fragrant, bright of color, and easily managed—growing\r\namong shrubbery, trees, and in places where other flowers would refuse\r\nto grow. They should be planted in clumps or masses, in September or\r\nOctober, setting the bulbs 5 to 8 inches apart, according to size, and\r\n3 or 4 inches deep.\r\n\r\nSeveral species and numberless varieties, both double and single, are\r\ngrown. A few good types only can be mentioned (Fig. 260):—\r\n\r\n_Daffodils, or Trumpet narcissus (Narcissus Pseudo-Narcissus_ and\r\nderivatives).\r\n\r\n_Single-flowered, Yellow_.—Golden Spur, Trumpet Major, Van Sion.\r\n\r\n_White_.—Albicans.\r\n\r\n_White and Yellow_.—Empress, Horsefieldi.\r\n\r\n_Double-flowering, Yellow_.—Incomparable fl. pl., Van Sion.\r\n\r\n_White_.—Alba plena odorata.\r\n\r\n_Poet’s narcissus (N. poeticus_). Flowers white, with yellow cups edged\r\ncrimson. Very fragrant.\r\n\r\n_Jonquils (N. Jonquilla_). These have very fragrant yellow flowers,\r\nboth double and single, and are old garden favorites.\r\n\r\n_Polyanthus narcissus (N. Tazetta_). These include paper-white, Chinese\r\nsacred lily (var. _orientalis_), and others.\r\n\r\n_Primrose Peerless (N. biflorus_).\r\n\r\nNarcissi may be forced into flower through the winter, as described on\r\np. 345. A popular kind for winter bloom is the so-called Chinese sacred\r\nlily. This grows in water without any soil whatever. Secure a bowl or\r\nglass dish, about three times the size of the bulb; put some pretty\r\nstones in the bottom; set in the bulb and build up around it with\r\nstones so as to hold it stiff when the leaves have grown; tuck two or\r\nthree small pieces of charcoal among the stones to keep the water\r\nsweet, then fill up the dish with water and add a little every few\r\ndays, as it evaporates. Set the dish in a warm, light place. In about\r\nsix weeks the fragrant, fine white flowers will fill the room with\r\nperfume. The Paper-white, closely allied to this, is also forced, and\r\nis one of the few good bulbs that may be bloomed before Christmas. The\r\nVan Sions, single and double (a form of daffodil), are also much\r\nforced.\r\n\r\nOleander.—An old favorite shrub for the window-garden, and much planted\r\nin the open far South.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many named varieties of the oleander, but two are often\r\nseen in general cultivation. These are the common red and white\r\nvarieties. Both these, as well as the named varieties, are of easy\r\nmanagement and well adapted to home culture, growing in pots or tubs\r\nfor several years without special care. Well-grown specimens are very\r\neffective as porch or lawn plants, or may be used to good advantage in\r\nmixed beds of tall-growing plants, plunging the pot or tub to the rim\r\nin the soil. The plants should be cut back after flowering. They should\r\nbe rested in any out-of-the-way place through the winter. When brought\r\nout in the spring, they should be given sun and air in order to make a\r\nsturdy growth.\r\n\r\nPropagation is effected by using well-ripened wood for cuttings, placed\r\nin a close frame; or the slips may be rooted in a bottle or can of\r\nwater, care being taken to supply water as evaporation takes place.\r\nAfter being rooted, they may be potted, using soil with a large\r\nproportion of sand. Well-established plants may be repotted in good\r\nloam and well-rotted manure. They should bloom the second year.\r\n\r\nOxalis.—A number of hardy species of oxalis are excellent plants for\r\nrock-work and edging. The greenhouse species are very showy, growing\r\nwithout extra care, and blooming freely through the late winter and\r\nspring months and some of them make excellent window-gardening\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe house species are mostly increased by bulbs, a few by division of\r\nthe root. _O. violacea_ is, one of the commonest of house-plants. Give\r\na sunny window, for the flowers open only in sun or very bright light.\r\nThe bulbous (tuberous) kinds are treated much as recommended for\r\n_Bulbs_, except that the bulbs must not freeze. The tubers are started\r\nin August or September for winter bloom. It is best to use deep pots,\r\nor the tubers will throw themselves out. The crown should be near the\r\nsurface. After flowering, the bulbs are dried off and kept until new\r\nbloom is wanted.\r\n\r\nThe “Bermuda buttercup” is _O. lutea_ and _O. flava_ of gardens\r\n(properly _O. cernua_); it is a Cape of Good Hope species. Its culture\r\nis not peculiar.\r\n\r\nPalms.—No more graceful plants for room decoration can be found than\r\nwell-grown specimens of some species of palms. Most florists’ palms are\r\nwell adapted for this purpose when small, and as the growth is usually\r\nvery slow, a plant may be used for many years.\r\n\r\nPalm plants thrive best in partial shade. One of the frequent causes of\r\nfailure in the culture of the palm is the overpotting and subsequent\r\noverwatering. A palm should not be repotted until the mass of roots\r\nfills the soil and preferably when it is active; then a pot only a size\r\nlarger should be used. Use ample drainage in the bottom to carry off\r\nexcess of water. Although the plants need a moist soil, water standing\r\nat the roots proves injurious. Withhold free use of water when the\r\nplants are partially dormant.\r\n\r\nA soil composed of well-rotted sod, leafmold, and a little sand will\r\nmeet the requirements.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary living-room conditions, palms are subject to much abuse.\r\nWater is allowed to stand in the jardinière, the plant is kept in dark\r\ncorners and hallways, the air is dry, and scale is allowed to infest\r\nthe leaves. If the plant begins to fail, the housewife is likely to\r\nrepot it or to give it more water, both of which may be wrong. The\r\naddition of bone-meal or other fertilizer may be better than repotting.\r\nKeep the plant in good light (but not in direct sunlight) as much as\r\npossible. Sponge the leaves to remove dust and scale, using soapsuds.\r\nWhen a new leaf begins to appear, add bone-meal to make it grow\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\nAmong the best palms for house culture are arecas, _Cocos Weddelliana,_\r\nlatania, kentia, howea, caryota, chamærops, and phœnix. Cycas may also\r\nbe regarded as a palm.\r\n\r\nThe date palm may be grown from seed of the common commercial date.\r\nSeed of the other varieties may be purchased from leading seedsmen;\r\nbut, as the seed germinates only under favorable conditions, and the\r\npalm is a very slow-growing plant while young, the best plan is to\r\npurchase the plants from a dealer when wanted. When the plants become\r\nweak or diseased, take them to a florist for treatment and\r\nrecuperation, or purchase new ones. Sometimes the florist places two or\r\nthree small palms in one pot, making a very satisfactory table piece\r\nfor two or three years.\r\n\r\nIt is well to set the palms out of doors in the summer, plunging the\r\npots nearly or quite to the rim. Turn or lift the pots occasionally so\r\nthat the roots will not strike through into the earth. Choose a\r\npartially shaded place, where the hot sun will not strike them directly\r\nand where the wind will not injure them.\r\n\r\nPandanus, or screw pine.—The screw pines are stiff-leaved saw-edged\r\nplants often grown in window-gardens and used for porch decoration.\r\n\r\nThe _Pandanus utilis_ and _P. Veitchii_ (the latter striped-leaved or\r\nwhite-leaved) are exceedingly ornamental, and are well adapted to house\r\nculture. The singular habit of growth, bright glossy leaves, and the\r\nability to withstand the dust and shade of a dwelling room, make them a\r\ndesirable addition to the house collection.\r\n\r\nThey are propagated by the offsets or young plants that grow around the\r\nbase of the trunk; or they may be increased by seed. If by the former\r\nmethod, the offsets should be cut off and set in sand, at a temperature\r\nof 65° or 70°. The cuttings root slowly and the plants for a time make\r\nvery slow growth. The general cultural treatment is that of palms. Give\r\nabundance of water in summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPansy (Fig. 244) is without doubt the most popular hardy spring flower\r\nin cultivation. The strains of seed are many, each containing great\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nThe culture is simple and the results are sure. Seed sown in August or\r\nSeptember, in boxes or a frame, will make plants large enough to reset\r\nin November (three or four inches apart) and bloom the following March;\r\nor they may be left until March in open seed-beds before setting out.\r\nAlso, if they are sown very thinly in the frames, they may remain\r\nundisturbed through the winter, blooming very early the following\r\nspring. The frames should be protected by mats, boards, or other\r\ncovering through the severe cold, and as the sun gains strength, care\r\nshould be taken to keep them from heaving by alternate thawing and\r\nfreezing. Seed sown in boxes in January or February will make fine\r\nblooming plants by April, taking the place of those blooming earlier.\r\n\r\nThe pansy is generally mentioned with plants suitable for partial\r\nshade, but it also thrives in other localities, especially where the\r\nsun is not very hot nor the weather very dry. The requisites for\r\nsatisfactory pansy culture are fertile, moist, cool soil, protection\r\nfrom the noonday sun, and attention to keeping plants from going to\r\nseed. As the ground becomes warm, a mulch of leafmold or other light\r\nmaterial should be spread over the bed to retain moisture and exclude\r\nheat. Spring and fall give the best bloom. In hot summer weather the\r\nflowers become small.\r\n\r\n\r\nPelargonium.—To this genus belong the plants known as geraniums—the\r\nmost satisfactory of house-plants, and extensively used as bedding\r\nplants. No plants will give better returns in leaf and flower; and\r\nthese features, added to the ease of propagation, make them general\r\nfavorites. The common geranium is one of the few plants that can be\r\nbloomed at any time of the year.\r\n\r\nThere are several main groups of pelargoniums, as the common “fish\r\ngeraniums” (from the odor of the foliage), the “show” or Lady\r\nWashington pelargoniums, the ivy geraniums, the thin-leaved bedders (as\r\nMadame Salleroi), and the “rose” geraniums.\r\n\r\nCuttings of partially ripened wood of all pelargoniums root very\r\neasily, grow to blooming size in a short time, and, either planted out\r\nor grown in a pot, make fine decorations. The common or fish geraniums\r\nare much more satisfactory when not more than a year old. Take cuttings\r\nfrom the old plants at least once a year. In four or five months the\r\nyoung plants begin to bloom. Plants may be taken up from the garden and\r\npotted, but they rarely give as much satisfaction as young, vigorous\r\nsubjects; new plants should be grown every year. Repot frequently until\r\nthey are in 4-to 5-inch pots; then let them bloom.\r\n\r\nThe show pelargoniums have but one period of bloom, usually in April,\r\nbut they make up in size and coloring. This section is more difficult\r\nto manage as house-plants than the common geranium, needing more direct\r\nlight to keep it stocky, and being troubled by insects. Still, all the\r\ntrouble taken to grow the plants will be well repaid by the handsome\r\nblossoms. Take cuttings in late spring, after flowering, and blooming\r\nplants may be had the following year. Good results are sometimes\r\nsecured by keeping these plants two or three years. Cut back after each\r\nblooming season.\r\n\r\nFor house culture the geraniums need a fertile, fibrous loam, with the\r\naddition of a little sand; good drainage is also an essential.\r\n\r\nPeony.—The herbaceous peony has long had a place in the garden; it has\r\nnow been much improved and constitutes one of the very best plants\r\nknown to cultivation. It is perfectly hardy, and free from the many\r\ndiseases and insects that attack so many plants. It continues to bloom\r\nyear after year without renewal, if the soil is well prepared and\r\nfertile. Fig. 250.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the peony is such a strong grower and produces so many\r\nenormous flowers, it must have a soil that can supply abundant\r\nplant-food and moisture. The old-fashioned single and semi-double\r\ncomparatively small-flowered kinds will give good results in any\r\nordinary ground, but the newer highly improved sorts must be given\r\nbetter treatment. This is one of the plants that profit by a very rich\r\nsoil. The place should be very deeply plowed or else trenched; and if\r\nthe land is in sod or is not in good heart, the preparation should\r\nbegin the season before the peonies are planted. A deep moist loam\r\nsuits them best; and as the plants grow and bloom, add bone meal and\r\ntop-dress with manure. When making their growth and when in bloom, they\r\nshould not be allowed to want for water.\r\n\r\nIn purchasing peony roots, be careful to secure only well-grown and\r\nselected stock. Cheap stock, job lots, and odds and ends are likely to\r\nbe very disappointing.\r\n\r\nThe plants may be set in fall or spring, the latter being preferable in\r\nthe North. Cover the crown bud 2 or 3 inches, being careful not to\r\ninjure it. If the best blooms are desired, give plenty of room, as much\r\nas 3 x 4 feet. Peonies grow 2 to 3 feet or even more in height. Strong\r\nroots of some varieties will give bloom the first year; considerable\r\nbloom will come the second year; but the full bloom on most varieties\r\nshould not be expected before the third year. The flowers may be\r\nbrightened and their duration prolonged by partial shade while in\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\nIf old plants become weak, or if they drop their buds, dig them up and\r\nsee whether the roots are not more or less dead and decayed; divide to\r\nfresh parts and replant in well-enriched ground; or purchase new\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nPeonies are propagated by division of the roots in early fall, one good\r\nstrong eye being left to each piece.\r\n\r\nThe peony has merit for its foliage as well as for its bloom,\r\nparticularly when the soil is rich and the growth luxuriant. This value\r\nof the plant is commonly overlooked. The peony deserves its popularity.\r\n\r\nPhlox.—Garden phloxes are of two kinds, the annual and perennial. Both\r\nare most valuable.\r\n\r\nExcepting the petunia, no plant will give the profusion of bloom with\r\nas little care as the annual phlox _(Phlox Drummondii_). For clear and\r\nbrilliant colors, the many varieties of this are certainly unrivaled.\r\nThe dwarf kinds are the more desirable for ribbon-beds, as they are not\r\nso “leggy.” There are whites, pinks, reds, and variegated of the most\r\ndazzling brilliancy. The dwarfs grow ten inches high, and bloom\r\ncontinuously. Set them 8 inches apart in good soil. Seed may be sown in\r\nthe open ground in May, or for early plants, in the hotbed in March.\r\nThey may be sown close in the fall if sown very late, so that the seeds\r\nwill not start till spring.\r\n\r\nThe perennial phlox of the gardens has been developed from the native\r\nspecies, _Phlox paniculata_ and P. _maculata_. The garden forms are\r\noften collectively known under the name of _P. decussata_. In recent\r\nyears the perennial phlox has been much improved, and it now\r\nconstitutes one of the best of all flower-garden subjects. It grows\r\nthree feet tall, and bears a profusion of fine flowers in heavy trusses\r\nin mid-summer to fall. Figs. 246, 248.\r\n\r\nPerennial phlox is of easy culture. The important point is that the\r\nplants begin to fail of best bloom about the third year, and they are\r\nlikely to become diseased; and new plantings should be made if the\r\nstrongest flowers are desired. The plants may be taken up in fall, the\r\nroots divided and cleaned of dead and weak parts, and the pieces\r\nreplanted. Usually, however, the beginner will secure more satisfaction\r\nin purchasing new cutting-grown plants. This phlox propagates readily\r\nby seed, and if one does not care to perpetuate the particular variety,\r\nhe will find much satisfaction in raising seedlings. Some varieties\r\n“come true” from seed with fair regularity. Seedlings should bloom the\r\nsecond year.\r\n\r\nFertile garden soil of any kind should raise good perennial phlox. See\r\nthat the plants do not want for water or plant-food at blooming time.\r\nLiquid manure will often help to keep them going. If they are likely to\r\nsuffer for water when in bloom, wet the ground well every evening.\r\n\r\nIf the leading shoots are pinched off early in the season, and again in\r\nmidsummer, the bloom will be later, perhaps in September rather than in\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nPrimulas, or primroses, are of various kinds, some being border plants,\r\nbut mostly known in this country as greenhouse and window-garden\r\nsubjects. One of them is the auricula. The true or English cowslip is\r\none of the hardy border plants; also the plants commonly known as\r\npolyanthus.\r\n\r\nCommon hardy primulas (or polyanthus and related forms) grow 6 to 10\r\ninches high, sending up trusses of yellow and red flowers in early\r\nspring. Propagated by division, or by seed sown a year before the\r\nplants are wanted. Give them rather moist soil.\r\n\r\nThe primula of the winter-garden is mostly the _P. Sinensis_ (Chinese\r\nPrimrose), grown very extensively by florists as a Christmas plant.\r\nWith the exception of the full double varieties, it is usually grown\r\nfrom seed. There is a popular single form known as _P. stellata_. The\r\nseed of Chinese primulas sown in March or April will make large\r\nflowering plants by November or December, if the young plants are\r\nshifted to larger pots as needed. The seed should be sown on the flat\r\nsurface of the soil, composed of equal parts loam, leafmold, and sand.\r\nThe seed should be pressed down lightly and the soil watered carefully\r\nto prevent the seed from being washed into the soil. Very fine sphagnum\r\nmoss may be sifted over the seed, or the box set in a moist place,\r\nwhere the soil will remain wet until the seeds germinate. When the\r\nplants are large enough, they should be potted separately or pricked\r\nout into shallow boxes. Frequent pottings or transplantings should be\r\ngiven until September, when they should be in the pots in which they\r\nare to bloom. The two essentials to successful growth through the hot\r\nsummer are shade and moisture. Height, 6 to 8 inches. Bloom in winter\r\nand spring.\r\n\r\nAt present the “baby Primrose” (_Primula Forbesi_) is popular. It is\r\ntreated in essentially the same way as the Sinensis. The obconica (_P.\r\nobconica_) in several forms is a popular florist’s plant, but is not\r\nmuch used in window-gardens. The hairs poison the hands of some\r\npersons. Culture practically as for _P. Sinensis_.\r\n\r\nAll primulas are impatient of a dry atmosphere and fluctuating\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nRhododendrons are broad-leaved evergreen shrubs that are admirably\r\nadapted to producing strong planting effects. Some of them are hardy in\r\nthe Northern states.\r\n\r\nRhododendrons require a fibrous or peaty soil and protection from bleak\r\nwinds and bright suns in summer and winter. A northern or somewhat\r\nshady exposure, to break the force of the midday sun, is advisable; but\r\nthey should not be planted where large trees will sap the fertility and\r\nmoisture from the ground. They protect each other if grown in masses,\r\nand also produce better planting effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. Pyracantha in fruit. One of the best ornamental-fruited plants for\r\nthe middle and milder latitudes. XIX. Pyracantha in fruit. One of the\r\nbest ornamental-fruited plants for the middle and milder latitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey require a deep, fibrous earth, and it is supposed that they do not\r\nthrive in limestone soils or where wood ashes are freely used. While\r\nrhododendrons will sometimes succeed without any special preparation of\r\nthe ground, it is advisable to take particular pains in this regard. It\r\nis well to dig a hole 2 or 3 feet deep, and fill it with earth\r\ncompounded of leafmold, well-rotted sod, and peat. The moisture supply\r\nshould be never failing, for they suffer from drought. They should be\r\nmulched summer and winter. Plant in spring.\r\n\r\nThe hardy garden forms are derivatives of _Rhododendron Catawbiense_,\r\nof the southern Appalachian Mountains. The Pontica and other forms are\r\nnot hardy in the North.\r\n\r\nThe “great laurel” of the northern United States is _Rhododendron\r\nmaximum_. This has been extensively colonized in large grounds by being\r\nremoved from the wild in carload lots. When the native conditions are\r\nimitated, it makes unusually good mass planting. Like all rhododendrons\r\nit is impatient of drought, hard soil, and full exposure to midday sun.\r\nThis species is valued for its foliage and habit more than for its\r\nbloom. The wild form of _R. Catawbiense_ is also transferred to grounds\r\nin large quantities.\r\n\r\nRose.—No home property is complete without roses. There are so many\r\nkinds and classes that varieties may be found for almost any purpose,\r\nfrom climbing or pillar subjects to highly fragrant teas, great hybrid\r\nperpetuals, free-blooming bedders, and good foliage subjects for the\r\nshrubbery. There is no flower in the growing of which one so quickly\r\ndevelops the temper and taste of the connoisseur.\r\n\r\nRoses are essentially flower-garden subjects rather than lawn subjects,\r\nsince flowers are their chief beauty. Yet the foliage of many of the\r\nhighly developed roses is good and attractive when the plants are well\r\ngrown. To secure the best results with roses, they should be placed in\r\na bed by themselves, where they can be tilled and pruned and well taken\r\ncare of, as other flower-garden plants are. The ordinary garden roses\r\nshould rarely be grown in mixed borders of shrubbery. It is usually\r\nmost satisfactory also to make beds of one variety rather than to mix\r\nthem with several varieties.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to have roses in mixed shrubbery borders, then the\r\nsingle and informal types should be chosen. The best of all these is\r\n_Rosa rugosa_. This has not only attractive flowers through the greater\r\npart of the season, but it also has very interesting foliage and a\r\nstriking habit. The great profusion of bristles and spines gives it an\r\nindividual and strong character. Even without the flowers, it is\r\nvaluable to add character and cast to a foliage mass. The foliage is\r\nnot attacked by insects or fungi, but remains green and glossy\r\nthroughout the year. The fruit is also very large and showy, and\r\npersists on bushes well through the winter. Some of the wild roses are\r\nalso very excellent for mixing into foliage masses, but, as a rule,\r\ntheir foliage characteristics are rather weak, and they are liable to\r\nbe attacked by thrips.\r\n\r\nThere are so many classes of roses that the intending planter is likely\r\nto be confused unless he knows what they are. Different classes require\r\ndifferent treatment. Some of them, as the teas and hybrid perpetuals\r\n(the latter also known as remontants), bloom from new canes; while the\r\nrugosa, the Austrian, Harrison’s yellow, sweet briers, and some others\r\nare bushes and do not renew themselves each year from the crown or\r\nbases of the canes.\r\n\r\nThe outdoor roses may be divided into two great groups so far as their\r\nblooming habit is involved:\r\n\r\n(1) The continuous or intermittent bloomers, as the hybrid perpetuals\r\n(blooming chiefly in June), bourbons, tea, rugosa, the teas and hybrid\r\nteas being the most continuous in bloom;\r\n\r\n(2)those that bloom once only, in summer, as Austrian, Ayrshire, sweet\r\nbriers, prairie, Cherokee, Banksian, provence, most moss roses, damask,\r\nmultiflora, polyantha, and memorial _(Wichuraiana)._ “Perpetual” or\r\nrecurrent-blooming races have been developed in the Ayrshire, moss,\r\npolyantha, and others.\r\n\r\nWhile roses delight in a sunny exposure, nevertheless our dry\r\natmosphere and hot summers are sometimes trying on the flowers, as are\r\nsevere wintry winds on the plants. While, therefore, it is never\r\nadvisable to plant roses near large trees, or where they will be\r\novershadowed by buildings or surrounding shrubbery, some shade during\r\nthe heat of the day will be a benefit. The best position is an eastern\r\nor northern slope, and where fences or other objects will break the\r\nforce of strong winds, in those sections where such prevail.\r\n\r\nRoses should be carefully taken up every four or five years, tops and\r\nroots cut in, and then reset, either in a new place or in the old,\r\nafter enriching the soil with a fresh supply of manure, and deeply\r\nspading it over. In Holland, roses are allowed to stand about eight\r\nyears. They are then taken out and their places filled with young\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n_Soil and planting for roses_.\r\n\r\nThe best soil for roses is a deep and rich clay loam. If it is more or\r\nless of a fibrous character from the presence of grass roots, as is the\r\ncase with newly plowed sod ground, so much the better. While such is\r\ndesirable, any ordinary soil will answer, provided it is well manured.\r\nCow manure is strong and lasting, and has no heating effect. It will\r\ncause no damage, even if not rotted. Horse manure, however, should be\r\nwell rotted before mixing it with the soil. The manure may be mixed in\r\nthe soil at the rate of one part in four. If well rotted, however, more\r\nwill not do any damage, as the soil can scarcely be made too rich,\r\nespecially for the everblooming (hybrid tea) roses. Care should be\r\ntaken to mix the manure thoroughly with the earth, and not to plant the\r\nroses against the manure.\r\n\r\nIn planting, care must be taken to avoid exposing the roots to the\r\ndrying of sun and air. If dormant field-grown plants have been\r\npurchased, all broken and bruised roots will need to be cut off\r\nsmoothly and squarely. The tops also will need cutting back. The cut\r\nshould always be made just above a bud, preferably on the outer side of\r\nthe cane. Strong-growing sorts may be cut back one-fourth or one-half,\r\naccording as they have good or bad roots. Weaker-growing kinds, as most\r\nof the everblooming roses, should be cut back-most severely. In both\r\ncases it is well to remove the weak growth first. Plants set out from\r\npots will usually not need cutting back.\r\n\r\nHardy roses, especially the strong field-grown plants, should be set in\r\nthe early fall if practicable. It is desirable to get them out just as\r\nsoon as they have shed their foliage. If not then, they may be planted\r\nin the early spring. At that season it is advisable to plant them as\r\nearly as the ground is dry enough, and before the buds have started to\r\ngrow. Dormant pot-plants may also be set out early, but they should be\r\nperfectly inactive. Setting them out early in this condition is\r\npreferable to waiting till they are in foliage and full bloom, as is so\r\noften required by buyers. Growing pot-plants may be planted any time in\r\nspring after danger of frost is past, or even during the summer, if\r\nthey are watered and shaded for a few days.\r\n\r\nOpen-ground plants should be set about as deep as they stood\r\npreviously, excepting budded or grafted plants, which should be set so\r\nthat the union of the stock and graft will be 2 to 4 inches below the\r\nsurface of the ground. Plants from pots may also be set an inch deeper\r\nthan they stood in the pots. The soil should be in a friable condition.\r\nRoses should have the soil compact immediately about their roots; but\r\nwe should distinguish between planting roses and setting fence posts.\r\nThe dryer the soil the more firmly it may be pressed.\r\n\r\nAs a general statement, it may be said that roses on their own roots\r\nwill prove more satisfactory for the general run of planters than\r\nbudded stock. On own-rooted stock, the suckers or shoots from below the\r\nsurface of the soil will be of the same kind, whereas with budded roses\r\nthere is danger of the stock (usually Manetti or dog rose) starting\r\ninto growth and, not being discovered, outgrowing the bud, taking\r\npossession, and finally killing out the weaker growth. Still, if the\r\nplants are set deep enough to prevent adventitious buds of the stock\r\nfrom starting and the grower is alert, this difficulty is reduced to a\r\nminimum. There is no question but that finer roses may be grown than\r\nfrom plants on their own roots, withstanding the heat of the American\r\nsummer, if the grower takes the proper precautions.\r\n\r\n_Pruning roses_.\r\n\r\nIn pruning roses, determine whether they bloom on canes arising each\r\nyear from the ground or near the ground, or whether they make perennial\r\ntops; also form a clear idea whether an abundance of flowers is wanted\r\nfor garden effects, or whether large specimen blooms are desired.\r\n\r\nIf one is pruning the hybrid perpetual or remontant roses (which are\r\nnow the common garden roses), he cuts back all very vigorous canes\r\nperhaps one-half their length immediately after the June bloom is past\r\nin order to produce new, strong shoots for fall flowering, and also to\r\nmake good bottoms for the next year’s bloom. Very severe summer\r\npruning, however, is likely to produce too much leafy growth. In the\r\nfall, all canes may be shortened to 3 feet, four or five of the best\r\ncanes being left to each plant. In spring, these canes are again cut\r\nback to fresh wood, leaving perhaps four or five good buds on each\r\ncane; from these buds the flowering canes of the year are to come. If\r\nit is desired to secure fewer blooms, but of the best size and quality,\r\nfewer canes may be left and only two or three new shoots be allowed to\r\nspring from each one the next spring.\r\n\r\nThe rule in trimming all cane-bearing roses is, _cut back weak growing\r\nkinds severely; strong growers moderately_.\r\n\r\nClimbing and pillar roses need only the weak branches and the tips\r\nshortened in. Other hardy kinds will usually need cutting back about\r\none-fourth or one-third, according to the vigor of the branches, either\r\nin the spring or fall.\r\n\r\nThe everblooming or hybrid tea roses will need to have all dead wood\r\nremoved at the time of uncovering them in spring. Some pruning during\r\nthe summer is also useful in encouraging growth and flowers. The\r\nstronger branches that have flowered may be cut back one-half or more.\r\n\r\nThe sweet briers, Austrian and rugosas may be kept in bush form; but\r\nthe trunks may be cut out at the ground every two or three years, new\r\nshoots having been allowed to come up in the meantime. All rampant\r\ngrowths should be cut back or taken out.\r\n\r\n_Insects and diseases of roses_.\r\n\r\nMost of the summer insects that trouble the rose are best treated by a\r\nforceful spray of clear water. This should be done early in the day and\r\nagain at evening. Those having city water or good spray pumps will find\r\nthis an easy method of keeping rose pests in check. Those without these\r\nfacilities may use whale-oil soap, fir-tree oil, good soap suds, the\r\ntobacco preparations, or Persian insect powder.\r\n\r\nThe rose-bug or chafer should be hand-picked or knocked off early in\r\nthe morning into a pan of coal oil. The leaf-roller must be crushed.\r\n\r\nThe mildews are controlled by the various sulfur sprays.\r\n\r\n_Winter protection of roses_.\r\n\r\nAll garden roses should be well mulched with leaves or coarse manure in\r\nthe fall. Mounding earth about the root also affords excellent\r\nprotection. Bending over the tops and covering with grass or evergreen\r\nboughs is also to be recommended for such kinds as are suspected to be\r\ninjured by winter; the boughs are preferable because they do not\r\nattract mice.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Ohio River all the everblooming roses, even if they will\r\nendure the winter unprotected, will be better for protection. This may\r\nbe slight southward, but should be thorough northward. The soil,\r\nlocation, and surroundings often determine the extent of protection. If\r\nthe situation is not so favorable, more protection will be necessary.\r\nAlong the Ohio, a heap of stable manure, or light soil that does not\r\nbecome packed and water-logged, placed about the base of the plants,\r\nwill carry over many of the tea roses. The tops are killed back; but\r\nthe plants sprout from the base of the old branches in the spring. Bon\r\nSilene, Etoile de Lyon, Perle des Jardins, Mme. Camille, and others are\r\nreadily wintered there in this way.\r\n\r\nAbout Chicago (_American Florist_, x., No. 358, p. 929, 1895) beds have\r\nbeen successfully protected by bending down the tops, fastening them,\r\nand then placing over and among the plants a layer of dead leaves to\r\nthe depth of a foot. The leaves must be dry, and the soil also, before\r\napplying them; this is very essential. After the leaves, a layer of\r\nlawn-clippings, highest at the middle, and 4 or 5 inches thick, placed\r\nover the leaves, holds them in place and sheds water. This protection\r\ncarries over the hardiest sorts of everblooming roses, including the\r\nteas. The tops are killed back when not bent down, but this protection\r\nsaves the roots and crowns; when bent down, the tops went through\r\nwithout damage. Even the climbing rose Gloire de Dijon was carried\r\nthrough the winter of 1894-1895 at Chicago without the slightest injury\r\nto the branches.\r\n\r\nStrong plants of the everblooming or hybrid tea roses can now be had at\r\nvery reasonable rates, and rather than go to the trouble of protecting\r\nthem in the fall, many persons buy such as they need for bedding\r\npurposes each spring. If the soil of the beds is well enriched, the\r\nplants make a rapid and luxuriant growth, blooming freely throughout\r\nthe summer.\r\n\r\nIf one desires to go to the trouble, he may protect these and also the\r\ntea roses even in the northern states by mounding earth about the\r\nplants and then building a little shed or house about them (or\r\ninverting a large box over them) and packing about the plants with\r\nleaves or straw. Some persons make boxes that can be knocked down in\r\nthe spring and stored. The roof should shed water. This method is\r\nbetter than tying the plants up in straw and burlaps. Some of the\r\nhybrid teas do not need so much protection as this, even in central New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of roses_.\r\n\r\nThe selection of kinds should be made in reference to the locality and\r\npurpose for which the roses are wanted. For bedding roses, those that\r\nare of free-blooming habit, even though the individual flowers are not\r\nlarge, are the ones that should be chosen. For permanent beds, the\r\nso-called hybrid perpetual or remontant roses, blooming principally in\r\nJune, will be found to be hardy at the North.—But if one can give them\r\nproper protection during the winter, then the Bengal, tea, bourbon, and\r\nhybrid teas or everblooming roses, may be selected.\r\n\r\nIn sections where the temperature does not fall below 20° above zero,\r\nany of the monthly roses will live without protection. At the South the\r\nremontants and other deciduous roses do not do as well as farther\r\nNorth. The tender climbers—Noisettes, climbing teas, bengals, and\r\nothers—are excellent for pillars, arbors, and verandas at the South,\r\nbut are fit only for the conservatory in those parts of the country\r\nwhere there is severe freezing. For the open air at the North we have\r\nto depend for climbing roses mainly on the prairie climbers, and the\r\nramblers (polyanthas), with their recent pink and white varieties. The\r\ntrailing _Rosa Wichuraiana_ is also a useful addition as an excellent\r\nhardy rose for banks.\r\n\r\nFor the northern states a choice small list is as follows: hybrid\r\nperpetuals, Mrs. John Laing, Wilder, Ulrich Brunner, Frau Karl\r\nDruschki, Paul Neyron; dwarf polyanthas, Clothilde Soupert, Madame\r\nNorbert Levavasseur (Baby Rambler), Mlle. Cecile Brunner; hybrid teas,\r\nGrus an Teplitz, La France, Caroline Testout, Kaiserin Victoria,\r\nKillarney; teas, Pink Maman Cochet, White Maman Cochet.\r\n\r\nThe following classified lists embrace some of the varieties of\r\nrecognized merit for various purposes. There are many others, but it is\r\ndesirable to limit the list to a few good kinds. The intending planter\r\nshould consult recent catalogues.\r\n\r\n_Free-blooming monthly roses for bedding_.—These are recommended not\r\nfor the individual beauty of the flower—although some are very fine—but\r\nbecause of their suitability for the purpose indicated. If to be\r\ncarried over winter in the open ground, they need to be protected north\r\nof Washington. In beds, pegging down the branches will be found\r\ndesirable. Those marked (A) have proved hardy in southern Indiana\r\nwithout protection, although they are more satisfactory with it.

Hunn).\r\n\r\nAlthough the growing of roses under glass must be left chiefly to\r\nflorists, advice may be useful to those who have conservatories:—\r\n\r\nWhen growing forcing roses for winter flowers, florists usually provide\r\nraised beds, in the best-lighted houses they have. The bottom of the\r\nbed or bench is left with cracks between the boards for drainage; the\r\ncracks are covered with inverted strips of sod, and the bench is then\r\ncovered with 4 or 5 inches of fresh, fibrous loam. This is made from\r\nrotted sods, with decayed manure incorporated at the rate of about one\r\npart in four. Sod from any drained pasture-land makes good soil. The\r\nplants are set on the bed in the spring or early summer, from 12 to 18\r\ninches apart, and are grown there all summer.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter they are kept at a temperature of 58° to 60° at\r\nnight, and from 5° to 10° warmer during the day. The heating pipes are\r\noften run under the benches, not because the rose likes bottom heat,\r\nbut to economize space and to assist in drying out the beds in case of\r\ntheir becoming too wet. The greatest care is required in watering, in\r\nguarding the temperature, and in ventilation. Draughts result in checks\r\nto the growth and in mildewed foliage.\r\n\r\nDryness of the air, especially from fire heat, is followed by the\r\nappearance of the minute red spider on the leaves. The aphis, or green\r\nplant louse, appears under all conditions, and must be kept down by the\r\nuse of some of the tobacco preparations (several of which are on the\r\nmarket).\r\n\r\nFor the red spider, the chief means of control is syringing with either\r\nclear or soapy water. If the plants are intelligently ventilated and\r\ngiven, at all times, as much fresh air as possible, the red spider is\r\nless likely to appear. For mildew, which is easily recognized by its\r\nwhite, powdery appearance on the foliage, accompanied with more or less\r\ndistortion of the leaves, the remedy is sulfur in some form or other.\r\nThe flowers of sulfur may be dusted thinly over the foliage; enough\r\nmerely slightly to whiten the foliage is sufficient. It may be dusted\r\non from the hand in a broadcast way, or applied with a powder-bellows,\r\nwhich is a better and less wasteful method. Again, a paint composed of\r\nsulfur and linseed oil may be applied to a part of one of the steam or\r\nhot-water heating pipes. The fumes arising from this are not agreeable\r\nto breathe, but fatal to mildew. Again, a little sulfur may be\r\nsprinkled here and there on the cooler parts of the greenhouse flue.\r\nUnder no circumstances, however, ignite any sulfur in a greenhouse. The\r\nvapor of burning sulfur is death to plants.\r\n\r\n_Propagation of house roses_.—The writer has known women who could root\r\nroses with the greatest ease. They would simply break off a branch of\r\nthe rose, insert it in the flower-bed, cover it with a bell-jar, and in\r\na few weeks they would have a strong plant. Again they would resort to\r\nlayering; in which case a branch, notched halfway through on the lower\r\nside, was bent to the ground and pegged down so that the notched part\r\nwas covered with a few inches of soil. The layered spot was watered\r\nfrom time to time. After three or four weeks roots were sent forth from\r\nthe notch and the branch or buds began to grow, when it was known that\r\nthe layer had formed roots.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago a friend took a cheese-box, filled it with sharp sand\r\nto the brim, supported it in a tub of water so that the lower half-inch\r\nof the box was immersed. The sand was packed down, sprinkled, and\r\nsingle-joint rose cuttings, with a bud and a leaf near the top, were\r\ninserted almost their whole length in the sand. This was in July, a hot\r\nmonth, when it is usually difficult to root any kind of cutting;\r\nmoreover, the box stood on a southern slope, facing the hot sun,\r\nwithout a particle of shade. The only attention given the box was to\r\nkeep the water high enough in the tub to touch the bottom of the\r\ncheese-box. In about three weeks he took out three or four dozen of as\r\nnicely rooted cuttings as could have been grown in a greenhouse.\r\n\r\nThe “saucer system,” in which cuttings are inserted in wet sand\r\ncontained in a saucer an inch or two deep, to be exposed at all times\r\nto the full sunshine, is of a similar nature. The essentials are, to\r\ngive the cuttings the “full sun” and to keep the sand saturated with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWhatever method is used, if cuttings are to be transplanted after\r\nrooting, it is important to pot them off in small pots as soon as they\r\nhave a cluster of roots one-half inch or an inch long. Leaving them too\r\nlong in the sand weakens the cutting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmilax of the florists is closely allied to asparagus (it is _Asparagus\r\nmedeoloides_ of the botanists). While it cannot be recommended for\r\nhouse culture, the ease with which it may be grown and the uses to\r\nwhich the festoons of leaves may be put entitle it to a place in the\r\nconservatory or greenhouse.\r\n\r\nSeed sown in pots or boxes in January or February, the plants shifted\r\nas needed until planted on the bench in August, will grow fine strings\r\nof green by the holidays. The temperature should be rather high. The\r\nplants should be set on low benches, giving as much room as possible\r\noverhead. Green-colored strings should be used for the vines to climb\r\non, the vines frequently syringed to keep down the red spider, which is\r\nvery destructive to this plant, and liquid manure given as the vines\r\ngrow. The soil should contain a good proportion of sand and be enriched\r\nwith well-rotted manure.\r\n\r\nAfter the first strings are cut, a second growth fully as good as the\r\nfirst may be had by cleaning up the plants and top-dressing the soil\r\nwith rotted manure. Sometimes the old roots are kept three or four\r\nyears. Slightly shading the house through August will add to the color\r\nof the leaves. The odor from a vine of smilax thickly covered with the\r\nsmall flowers is very agreeable.\r\n\r\nStocks.—The Ten-weeks and the biennial or Brompton stocks (species of\r\n_Matthiola_) are found in nearly all old-fashioned gardens. Most\r\ngardens are thought to be incomplete without them, and the use of the\r\nbiennial flowering species as house-plants is increasing.\r\n\r\nThe Ten-weeks stock is usually grown from seed sown in hotbeds or boxes\r\nin March. The seedlings are transplanted several times previous to\r\nbeing planted out in early May. At each transplanting the soil should\r\nbe made a little richer. The double flowers will be more numerous when\r\nthe soil is rich.\r\n\r\nThe biennial species (or Brompton stocks) should be sown the season\r\nprevious to that in which flowers are wanted, the plants wintered over\r\nin a cool house, and grown in the following spring. They may be planted\r\nout through the summer and lifted into pots in August or September for\r\nwinter flowering. These may be increased by cuttings taken from the\r\nside shoots; but the sowing of seed is a surer method, and unless an\r\nextra fine variety is to be saved, it would be the best one to pursue.\r\nHeight, 10 to 15 inches.\r\n\r\nSweet pea.—A hardy, tendril-climbing annual, universally prized as an\r\noutdoor garden plant; also forced to some extent by florists. On any\r\noccasion the sweet pea is in place. A bouquet of shaded colors, with a\r\nfew sprays of galium or the perennial gypsophila, makes one of the\r\nchoicest of table decorations.\r\n\r\nDeep, mellow soil, early planting, and heavy mulching suit them\r\nadmirably. It is easy to make soils too rich in nitrogen for sweet\r\npeas; in such case, they will run to vine at the expense of flowers.\r\n\r\nSow the seeds as soon as the ground is fit to work in the spring,\r\nmaking a drill 5 inches deep. Sow thickly and cover with 2 inches of\r\nearth. When the plants have made 2 or 3 inches’ growth above the earth,\r\nfill the drill nearly full, leaving a slight depression in which water\r\nmay be caught. After the soil is thoroughly soaked with water, a good\r\nmulch will hold the moisture. To have the ground ready in early spring,\r\nit is a good plan to trench the ground in the fall. The top of the soil\r\nthen dries out very quickly in spring and is left in good physical\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIn the middle and southern states the seed may be planted in fall,\r\nparticularly in lighter soils.\r\n\r\nFrequent syringing with clear water will keep off the red spider that\r\noften destroys the foliage, and attention to picking the seed pods will\r\nlengthen the season of bloom. If the finest flowers are wanted, do not\r\nlet the plants stand less than 8 to 12 inches apart.\r\n\r\nA succession of sowings may be made at intervals through May and June,\r\nand a fair fall crop secured if care is taken to water and mulch; but\r\nthe best results will be secured with the very early planting. When the\r\nplants are watered, apply enough to soak the soil, and do not water\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nSwainsona.—This plant has been called the winter sweet pea, but the\r\nflowers are not fragrant. It makes a very desirable house plant,\r\nblooming through the late winter and early spring months. The blossoms,\r\nwhich resemble those of the pea, are borne in long racemes. The foliage\r\nis finely cut, resembling small locust leaves, and adds to the beauty\r\nof the plant, the whole effect being exceedingly graceful. Swainsona\r\nmay be grown from seed or cuttings. Cuttings taken in late winter\r\nshould make blooming plants in summer; these plants may be used for\r\nwinter bloom, but it is better to raise new plants. Some gardeners cut\r\nback old plants to secure new blooming wood; this is desirable if the\r\nplants grow more or less permanently in the greenhouse border, but for\r\npots new plants should be grown.\r\n\r\nThe common swainsona is white-flowered; but there is a good\r\nrose-colored variety.\r\n\r\nTuberose (properly _tuber-ose,_ not _tube-rose,_ from its specific\r\nname, _Polianthes tuberosa_).—This plant, with its tall spikes of waxen\r\nand fragrant white flowers, is well known in the middle latitudes, but\r\nusually requires more heat and a longer season than are commonly\r\npresent in the most northern states.\r\n\r\nThe tuberose is a strong feeder, and loves warmth, plenty of water\r\nwhile growing, and a deep, rich, and well-drained soil. The bulbs may\r\nbe set in the garden or border the last of May or in June, covering\r\nthem about 1 inch deep. Preparatory to planting, the old dead roots at\r\nthe base of the bulb should be cut away and the pips or young bulbs\r\nabout the sides removed. After keeping them till their scars are dried\r\nover, these pips may be planted 5 or 6 inches apart in drills, and with\r\ngood soil and cultivation they will make blooming bulbs for the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nBefore planting the large bulbs, it may be well to examine the points,\r\nto determine whether they are likely to bloom. The tuberose blooms but\r\nonce. If there is a hard, woody piece of old stem in the midst of the\r\ndry scales at the apex of the bulb, it has bloomed, and is of no value\r\nexcept for producing pips. Likewise if, instead of a solid core, there\r\nis a brownish, dry cavity extending from the tip down into the middle\r\nof the bulb, the heart has rotted or dried up, and the bulb is\r\nworthless as far as blooming is concerned.\r\n\r\nBulbs of blooming size set in the border in June flower toward the\r\nclose of September. They may be made to flower three or four weeks\r\nsooner by starting them early in some warm place, where they may be\r\ngiven a temperature of about 60° to 70°. Prepare the bulbs as above,\r\nand place them with their tips just above the surface in about 3-or\r\n4-inch pots, in light sandy soil. Water them thoroughly, afterwards\r\nsparingly, till the leaves have made considerable growth. These plants\r\nmay be turned out into the open ground the last of May or in June, and\r\nwill probably flower in early September.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. A simple but effective window-box, containing geraniums, petunias,\r\nverbenas, heliotrope, and vines. XX. A simple but effective window-box,\r\ncontaining geraniums, petunias, verbenas, heliotrope, and vines.\r\n\r\nIn the northern states, if planted in the border they will not start\r\ninto growth until the ground has become thoroughly warm,—usually after\r\nthe middle of June,—making the season before frost too short for their\r\nperfect growth and flower. If any danger of fall frost is feared, they\r\nmay be lifted into pots or boxes and taken into the house, when they\r\nwill bloom without a check. As with other bulbs, a sandy soil will\r\nsuit.\r\n\r\nJust before frost dig up the bulbs, cut off the tops to within 2 inches\r\nof the apex of the bulb. They may then be placed in shallow boxes and\r\nleft out in the sun and air for a week or more, to cure. Each evening,\r\nif the nights are cold, they should be removed to some room where the\r\ntemperature will not fall below 40°. When the outer scales have become\r\ndry, the remaining soil may be shaken off and the bulbs stored away in\r\nshallow boxes for the winter. They keep best in a temperature of 45° to\r\n50°. It should never fall below 40°.\r\n\r\nThe Dwarf Pearl, originating in 1870, has long been popular, and is\r\nstill so with many. But others have come to prefer the old, tall kind,\r\nthe flowers of which, even if not so large, are perfect in form and\r\nseem to open better.\r\n\r\nTulips are undoubtedly the most prized of all early spring bulbs. They\r\nare hardy and easy to grow. They also bloom well in winter in a sunny\r\nclimate. The garden bed will last several years if well cared for, but\r\nmost satisfactory bloom is secured if the old bulbs are taken up every\r\ntwo or three years and replanted, all the inferior ones being cast\r\naside. When the stock begins to run out, buy anew. The old stock, if\r\nnot entirely spent, may be planted in the shrubbery or perennial\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nSeptember is the best time for planting tulips, but as the beds are\r\nusually occupied at this time, planting is commonly postponed till\r\nOctober of November. For garden culture the single early tulips are the\r\nbest. There are excellent early double-flowered varieties. Some prefer\r\nthe double, as their flowers last longer. Late tulips are gorgeous, but\r\noccupy the beds too long in the spring. While tulips are hardy, they\r\nare benefited by a winter mulch.\r\n\r\nIn working out design patterns, the utmost care should be used to have\r\nthe lines and curves uniform, which is only to be secured by marking\r\nout the design, and careful planting. Formal planting is, however, by\r\nno means necessary for pleasing effects. Borders, lines, and masses of\r\nsingle colors, or groups of mixed colors which harmonize, are always in\r\norder and pleasing. Clear colors are preferable to neutral tints. As\r\nvarieties vary in height and season of blooming, only named varieties\r\nshould be ordered if uniform bedding effects are desired. See pp. 286\r\nand 345; Fig. 255.\r\n\r\nViolet.—While the culture of violets as house-plants rarely proves\r\nsuccessful, there is no reason why a good supply may not be had\r\nelsewhere through the greater part of the winter and the spring months.\r\n\r\nA sheltered location being selected, young plants from runners may be\r\nset in August or September. Have the ground fertile and well drained.\r\nThese plants will make fine crowns by December, and often will bloom\r\nbefore weather sufficiently cold to freeze them.\r\n\r\nTo have flowers through the winter, it will be necessary to afford some\r\nprotection. This may best be accomplished by building a frame of boards\r\nlarge enough to cover the plants, making the frame in the same way as\r\nfor a hotbed, 4 to 6 inches higher at the back than the front. Cover\r\nthe frame with sash or boards, and as the weather becomes severe, mats\r\nor straw should be placed over and around the frame to protect the\r\nplants from freezing. Whenever the weather will permit, the covering\r\nshould be removed and air admitted, but no harm will come if the frames\r\nare not disturbed for several weeks. Much sunlight and a high\r\ntemperature through the middle of winter are to be avoided, for if the\r\nplants are stimulated, a shorter period of bloom will result. In April\r\nthe frame may be removed, the plants yielding the later part of the\r\ncrop without protection.\r\n\r\nViolets belong with the “cool” plants of florists. When well hardened\r\noff, considerable frost does not harm them. They should always be kept\r\nstocky. Start a new lot from runner-plants each year. They thrive in a\r\ntemperature of 55° to 65°. Pages 190, 206.\r\n\r\nWax-plant.—The wax-plant, or hoya, is one of the commonest of\r\nwindow-garden plants, and yet it is one that house-gardeners usually\r\nhave difficulty in flowering. However, it is one of the easiest plants\r\nto manage if a person understands its nature.\r\n\r\nIt is naturally a summer-blooming plant, and should rest in winter. In\r\nthe winter, keep it just alive in a cool and rather dry place. If the\r\ntemperature does not go above 50° Fahr., so much the better; neither\r\nshould it go much lower. In late winter or spring, the plant is brought\r\nout to warm temperature, given water, and started into growth. The old\r\nflower-stems should not be cut off, since new flowers come from them as\r\nwell as from the new wood. When it is brought out to be started into\r\ngrowth, it may be repotted, sometimes into a size larger pot, but\r\nalways with more or less fresh earth. The plant should increase in\r\nvalue each year. In conservatories, it is sometimes planted out in the\r\nground and allowed to run over a wall, in which case it will reach a\r\nheight of many feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE GROWING OF THE FRUIT PLANTS\r\n\r\nFruits should be counted a regular part of the home premises. There are\r\nfew residence plots so small that fruits of some kind cannot be grown.\r\nIf there is no opportunity for planting the orchard fruits by\r\nthemselves at regular intervals, there are still boundaries to the\r\nplace, and along these boundaries and scattered in the border masses,\r\napples, pears, and other fruits may be planted.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected that fruits will thrive as well in these\r\nplaces as in well-tilled orchards, but something can be done, and the\r\nresults are often very satisfactory. Along a back fence or walk, one\r\nmay plant a row or two of currants, gooseberries, or blackberries, or\r\nhe may make a trellis of grapes. If there are no trees near the front\r\nor back of the border, the fruit plants may be placed close together in\r\nthe row and the greatest development of the tops may be allowed to take\r\nplace laterally. If one has a back yard fifty feet on a side, there\r\nwill be opportunity, in three borders, for six to eight fruit trees,\r\nand bush-fruits between, without encroaching greatly on the lawn. In\r\nsuch cases, the trees are planted just inside the boundary line.\r\n\r\nA suggestion for the arrangement of a fruit garden of one acre is given\r\nin Fig. 270. Such a plan allows of continuous cultivation in one\r\ndirection and facilitates spraying, pruning, and harvesting; and the\r\nintermediate spaces may be used for the growing of annual crops, at\r\nleast for a few years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 270. Plan for a fruit-garden of one acre. From\r\n“Principles of Fruit-growing.”]\r\n\r\n_Dwarf fruit-trees._\r\n\r\nFor very small areas, and for the growing of the finest dessert fruits,\r\ndwarf trees may be grown of apples and pears. The apple is dwarfed when\r\nit is worked on certain small and slow-growing types of apple trees, as\r\nthe paradise and doucin stocks. The paradise is the better, if one\r\ndesires a very small and productive tree or bush. The doucin makes only\r\na half-dwarf. The pear is dwarfed when it is grown on the root of\r\nquince. Dwarf pears may be planted as close as ten feet apart each way,\r\nalthough more room should be given them if possible. Paradise dwarfs\r\n(apples) may be planted eight or ten feet each way, and doucin twice\r\nthat distance. All dwarfs should be kept small by vigorous annual\r\nheading-in. If the tree is making good growth, say one to three feet, a\r\nhalf to two-thirds of the growth may be taken off in winter. A dwarf\r\napple or pear tree should be kept within a height of twelve or fifteen\r\nfeet, and it should not attain this stature in less than ten or twelve\r\nyears. A dwarf apple tree, in full bearing, should average from two\r\npecks to a bushel of first quality apples, and a dwarf pear should do\r\nsomewhat more than this.\r\n\r\nIf one grows dwarf fruit trees, he should expect to give them extra\r\nattention in pruning and cultivating. Only in very exceptional\r\ninstances can the dwarf fruits be expected to equal the free-growing\r\nstandards in commercial results. This is particularly true of dwarf\r\napples, which are practically home-garden plants in this country. This\r\nbeing the case, only the choice dessert fruits should be attempted on\r\nparadise and doucin roots. For home gardens the paradise will probably\r\ngive more satisfaction than the doucin.\r\n\r\nIf the tree is taken young, it may be trained along a wall or on an\r\nespalier trellis; and in such conditions the fruits should be of extra\r\nquality if the varieties are choice. Plate XXII shows the training of a\r\ndwarf pear on a wall. This tree has been many years in good bearing. In\r\nmost parts of the country a southern wall exposure is likely to force\r\nthe bloom so early as to invite danger from spring frosts.\r\n\r\n_Age and size of trees_.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary planting, it is desirable to choose trees two years from\r\nbud or graft, except in case of the peach, which should be one year\r\nold. Many growers find strong one-year trees preferable. A good size is\r\nabout five-eighths of an inch in diameter just above the collar, and\r\nfive feet in height, and if they have been well grown, trees of this\r\nsize will give as good results as those seven-eighths of an inch, or\r\nmore, in diameter, and six or seven feet high. Buy first-class trees of\r\nreliable dealers. It rarely pays to try to save a few cents on a tree,\r\nfor quality is likely to be sacrificed.\r\n\r\nIf properly packed, trees can be shipped long distances and may do as\r\nwell as those grown in a home nursery, but it will generally be best to\r\nsecure the trees as near home as possible, provided the quality of the\r\ntrees and the price are satisfactory. When a large number is to be\r\npurchased, it will be better to send the order direct to some reliable\r\nnursery, or to select the trees in person, than to rely on tree\r\npeddlers.\r\n\r\n_Pruning_.\r\n\r\nHaving planted the trees, they should be carefully pruned. As a rule,\r\ntrees with low heads are desirable. Peaches and dwarf pears should have\r\nthe lower branches from 12 to 24 inches above ground, and sweet\r\ncherries and standard pears generally not over 30 inches; plums, sour\r\ncherries, and apples may be somewhat higher, but if properly handled,\r\nwhen started 3 feet from the ground, the tops will not be in the way of\r\nthe cultivation of the orchard.\r\n\r\nFor all except the peach in the northern states, a pyramidal form will\r\nbe desirable. To secure this, four or five side branches with three or\r\nfour buds each, should be allowed to grow and the center shoot should\r\nbe cut off at a height of 10 to 12 inches. After growth has started,\r\nthe trees should be occasionally examined and all surplus shoots\r\nremoved, thus throwing the full vigor of the plant into those that\r\nremain. As a rule three or four shoots on each branch may be left to\r\nadvantage. The following spring the shoots should be cut back one-half\r\nand about half of the branches removed. Care should be taken to avoid\r\ncrotches, and if any of the branches cross, so that they are likely to\r\nrub, one or the other should be cut out. This cutting-back and\r\ntrimming-out should be continued for two or three years, and in the\r\ncase of dwarf pear trees regular heading-back each year should be\r\ncontinued. Although an occasional heading-back will be of advantage to\r\nthe trees, apple, plum, and cherry trees that have been properly pruned\r\nwhile young will not require so much attention after they come into\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\nHeavy pruning of the top tends to the production of wood; therefore the\r\nsevere pruning of orchard trees, following three or four years of\r\nneglect, sets the trees into heavy wood-bearing, and makes them more\r\nvigorous. Such treatment generally tends away from fruit-bearing. This\r\nheavy pruning is usually necessary in neglected orchards, however, to\r\nbring trees back into shape and to revitalize them; but the best\r\npruning-treatment of an orchard is to prune it a little every year. It\r\nshould be so pruned that the tops of the trees will be open, that no\r\ntwo limbs will interfere with each other, and so that the fruit itself\r\nwill not be so abundant as to overload the tree.\r\n\r\nIn general, it is best to prune orchard trees late in winter or early\r\nin spring. It is sometimes better, however, to leave peaches and other\r\ntender fruits until after the buds have swollen, or even after the\r\nflowers have fallen, in order that one may determine how much they have\r\nbeen injured by the winter. Grape vines should be pruned in winter or\r\nnot later (in New York) than the first of March. If pruned later than\r\nthis, they may bleed. The above remarks will apply to other trees as\r\nwell as to fruits.\r\n\r\n_Thinning the fruit_.\r\n\r\nIf the best size and quality of fruit are desired, care must be taken\r\nto see that the plant does not overbear.\r\n\r\nThinning of fruit has four general uses: to cause the remaining fruit\r\nto grow larger; to increase the chances of annual crops; to save the\r\nvitality of the tree; to enable one to combat insects and diseases by\r\ndestroying the injured fruit.\r\n\r\nThe thinning is nearly always performed soon after the fruit is\r\nthoroughly set. It is then possible to determine which of the fruits\r\nare likely to persist. Peaches are usually thinned when they are the\r\nsize of one’s thumb. If thinned before this time, they are so small\r\nthat it is difficult to pick them off; and it is not so easy to see the\r\nwork of the curculio and thereby to select the injured fruits. Similar\r\nremarks apply to other fruits. The general tendency is, even with those\r\nwho thin their fruits, not to thin enough. It is usually safer to take\r\noff what would seem to be too many than not to take off enough. The\r\nremaining specimens are better. Varieties that tend to overbear profit\r\nvery greatly by thinning. This is notably the case with many Japanese\r\nplums, which, if not thinned, are very inferior.\r\n\r\nThinning may also be accomplished by pruning. Cutting off the\r\nfruit-buds will have the effect of removing the fruit. In the case of\r\ntender fruits, as peaches, however, it may not be advisable to thin\r\nvery heavily by means of pruning, since the fruit may be still further\r\nthinned by the remaining days of winter, by late spring frost, or by\r\nthe leaf-curl or other disease. However, the proper pruning of a peach\r\ntree in winter is, in part, a thinning of the fruit. The peach is borne\r\non the wood of the previous season’s growth. The best fruits are to be\r\nexpected the strongest and heaviest growth. It is the practice of\r\npeach-growers to remove all the weak and immature wood from the inside\r\nof the tree. This has the effect of thinning out the inferior fruit and\r\nallowing the energy of the tree to be expended on the remainder.\r\n\r\nApples are rarely thinned; but, in many cases, thinning can be done\r\nwith profit.\r\n\r\n_Washing and scrubbing the trees_.\r\n\r\nThe washing of orchard trees is an old practice. It usually results in\r\nmaking a tree more vigorous. One reason is that it destroys insects and\r\nfungi that lodge underneath the bark; but probably the chief reason is\r\nthat it softens the bark and allows the trunk to expand. It is\r\npossible, also, that the potash from the soap or lye eventually passes\r\ninto the ground and affords some plant-food. Trees are ordinarily\r\nwashed with soap suds or with a lye solution. The material is usually\r\napplied with an old broom or a stiff brush. The scrubbing of the tree\r\nis perhaps nearly or quite as beneficial as the application of the wash\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to wash trees late in spring or early in summer, and\r\nagain in the fall, with the idea that such washing destroys the eggs\r\nand the young of borers. It no doubt will destroy borers if they are\r\njust getting a start, but it will not keep away the insects that lay\r\nthe eggs, and will not destroy the borers that have found their way\r\nbeneath the bark. It is perhaps quite as well to wash the trees very\r\nearly in the spring, when they are starting into growth.\r\n\r\nIt is an old practice to wash trees with strong lye when they are\r\naffected with the oyster-shell bark louse. The modern method of\r\ntreating these pests, however, is to spray with some kerosene or oil\r\ncompound when the young growth is starting, for at that time the young\r\ninsects are migrating to the new wood and they are very easily\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe whitewashing of the trunks of trees tends also to relieve them of\r\ninsects and fungi; and it is probable that in hot and dry regions the\r\nwhite covering affords protection from climate.\r\n\r\n_Gathering and keeping fruit_.\r\n\r\nNearly all fruits should be gathered as soon as they will readily part\r\nfrom the stems on which they are borne. With many perishable fruits the\r\nproper time for gathering will be determined largely by the distance\r\nthey are to be shipped. With the exception of winter varieties of\r\napples and pears and a few kinds of grapes, it is best to dispose of\r\nfruit soon after it is gathered, unless it is kept for family use.\r\n\r\nIf for winter use, the fruit should at once be placed in the cellar or\r\nfruit house in which it is to be stored, and there kept as near the\r\nfreezing point as possible. There will be less danger of shriveling if\r\nthe fruit is placed at once in closed barrels or other tight packages,\r\nbut if proper ventilation is provided, it may be kept in bins with\r\nlittle loss. Even though no ice is used, it will be possible to\r\nmaintain a fairly low temperature by opening the windows at night when\r\nthe outside atmosphere is colder than that inside the building, and\r\nclosing them during the day as the outer air becomes warmer.\r\n\r\nFruit should be handled with great care at all times, for if the cells\r\nbecome broken by rough handling, the keeping qualities will be greatly\r\ninjured. The illustrations (Figs. 187-189) show three types of fruit\r\nstorage houses.\r\n\r\nApples and winter pears may be packed in sand or leaves in the cellar\r\n(in boxes) and thereby be kept from shriveling.\r\n\r\nAlmond.—The almond tree is seldom seen in the eastern states, but now\r\nand then one will be found in a yard and not bearing. The failure to\r\nbear may be due to frost injury or lack of pollination.\r\n\r\nThe almond is about as hardy as the peach, but it blooms so early in\r\nthe spring that it is little grown east of the Pacific slope. It is an\r\ninteresting ornamental tree, and its early bloom is a merit when the\r\nfruit is not desired. The almonds commonly sold by nurserymen in the\r\neast are hard-shell varieties, and the nuts are not good enough for\r\ncommerce. The almond fruit is a drupe, like the peach, but the flesh is\r\nthin and hard and the pit is the “almond” of commerce. Culture as for\r\npeach.\r\n\r\nThe “flowering almonds” are bushes of different species from the\r\nfruit-bearing tree. They are usually grafted on plum, and the stock is\r\nlikely to throw up suckers and cause trouble.\r\n\r\nApples thrive over a wider range of territory and under more varied\r\nconditions than any other tree fruit. This means that they are easy to\r\ngrow. In fact they are so easy to grow that they are usually neglected.\r\n\r\nApples do best on a strong, sandy loam soil, or a light clay loam.\r\nWhile a soil very rich in organic matter is not desirable, good results\r\ncannot be secured unless it contains a fair amount of vegetable matter.\r\nA clover sod is particularly desirable for this as well as for other\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nFor a commercial orchard, most varieties should be from 35 to 40 feet\r\napart; but the slow-growing and long-lived sorts may be at 40 feet,\r\nand, halfway between in both directions, some of the short-lived,\r\nearly-bearing varieties may be placed, to be removed after they begin\r\nto crowd. In home grounds the trees may be placed somewhat closer than\r\n35 to 40 feet, especially if they are planted on the boundaries, so\r\nthat the limbs may project freely in one direction.\r\n\r\nIt is ordinarily advisable, especially in the humid climates east of\r\nthe Great Lakes, to have the body of the tree 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 feet long.\r\nThe limbs should be trimmed up to this point when the tree is set. From\r\nthree to five main branches may be left to form the framework of the\r\ntop. These should be shortened back one-fourth or one-half when the\r\ntree is set. (Figs. 142-145) Subsequent pruning should keep the top of\r\nthe tree open and maintain it in more or less symmetrical form. West of\r\nthe Great Lakes, particularly on the plains and in the semi-arid\r\nregions, the top may be started much nearer the ground.\r\n\r\nIn orchard conditions, the trees should be kept in clean culture,\r\nespecially for the first few years; but this is not always possible in\r\nhome yards. In lieu of tillage, the sward may be mulched each fall with\r\nstable manure, and commercial fertilizer may be applied each fall or\r\nspring. If fruit is wanted rather than foliage and shade, care should\r\nbe taken not to make ground too rich, but to keep it in such condition\r\nthat the tree is making a fairly vigorous growth, with good strong\r\nfoliage, but is not overgrowing. An apple tree in full bearing is\r\nusually in good condition if the twigs grow 10 to 18 inches each\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nApple trees should begin to bear when three to five years planted, and\r\nat ten years should be bearing good crops. With good treatment, they\r\nshould continue to bear for thirty or more years in the northeastern\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. The king of fruits. Newtown as grown in the Pacific country. XXI.\r\nThe king of fruits. Newtown as grown in the Pacific country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insects and diseases of the apple_.\r\n\r\nAmong the insects most commonly found on the apple tree are the\r\ncodlin-moth, canker-worm, and tent-caterpillar. The codlin-moth lays\r\nits egg on the fruit soon after the blossoms fall, and the larvae, on\r\nhatching, eat their way inside. A thorough spraying of the trees with\r\narsenites within a week after the blossoms fall will do much toward\r\ndestroying them; and a second application, in about three weeks, will\r\nbe essential. The canker-worm (Fig. 217) and tent-caterpillars feed on\r\nthe leaves, and can also be destroyed by means of arsenites. To be\r\neffective against the former, however, the applications must be made\r\nsoon after they hatch, and very thoroughly.\r\n\r\nA close watch should be kept for borers. Whenever the bark appears to\r\nbe dead or sunken in patches, remove it and search for the cause. A\r\nborer will usually be found underneath the bark. About the base of the\r\ntree the most serious injury occurs from borers, since the insect which\r\nenters there bores into the hard wood. His presence can be determined\r\nby the chips that are cast from his burrows. If the trees are well\r\ncultivated and in a thrifty growing condition, the injury will be\r\ngreatly reduced. It will be well to wash the trunks and larger branches\r\nwith soft soap, thinned with water so that it can be applied with a\r\nbrush or broom, during the spring. The addition of an ounce of Paris\r\ngreen in each five gallons of the wash will be of value. The only real\r\nremedy, however, is to dig the borers out.\r\n\r\nThe most troublesome disease of the apple is the apple-scab, which\r\ndisfigures the fruit as well as lessens its size. It also often does\r\nmuch harm to the foliage, and thus checks the growth of the trees (Fig.\r\n214). The Baldwin, Fameuse, Northern Spy and Red Canada are\r\nparticularly subject to this disease, and it is much more troublesome\r\nin moist seasons than when the weather is dry. The use of fungicides\r\nwill do much to lessen the injury from this disease.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of apple_.\r\n\r\nThe selection of varieties of apples for home use is, to a large\r\nextent, a personal matter; and no one may say what to plant. A variety\r\nthat is successfully grown in one section may prove disappointing in\r\nanother. One should study the locality in which he wishes to plant and\r\nchoose those varieties which are the most successfully grown\r\nthere,—choosing from amongst the successful kinds those which he likes\r\nbest and which seem best to meet the purposes for which he is to grow\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFor the northern and eastern states, the following varieties will\r\ngenerally be found valuable:—\r\n\r\n[The varieties marked with * are particularly valuable for market\r\npurposes as well as for home use; the others are chiefly desirable for\r\nhome use.]\r\n_Early_.—Yellow Transparent, Early Harvest, Early Strawberry, Primate,\r\nDyer, Summer Rose, Early Joe, Red Astrachan, Golden Sweet, Oldenburg,*\r\nSummer Pearmain, Williams (Favorite), Chenango, Bough (Sweet), Summer\r\nQueen, Gravenstein,* Jefferis, Porter, Maiden Blush.\r\n\r\n_Autumn_.—Bailey (Sweet), Fameuse,* Jersey Sweet, Fall Pippin,\r\nWealthy,* Mother, Twenty Ounce, Magnate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 271.

When grown at all, it is\r\nlikely to be trained on walls, after the English custom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 274. Roman Apricot.]\r\n\r\nIn the latitude of New York, the apricot has proved as hardy as the\r\npeach. Given the right conditions as to soil and exposure, it will\r\nyield abundant crops, ripening its fruits about three weeks in advance\r\nof early peaches.\r\n\r\nThe apricot usually thrives best on strong land; but otherwise the\r\ntreatment given the peach suits it very well. The soil should be rather\r\ndry; especially should the subsoil be such that no water may stand\r\naround the roots. The exposure should be to the north or west to retard\r\nthe blooming period, as the one great drawback to the successful\r\nfruiting is the early blooming and subsequent freezing of the flowers\r\nor the small fruits.\r\n\r\nThe two serious difficulties in the growing of apricots are the ravages\r\nof the curculio, and the danger to the flowers from the spring frosts.\r\nIt is usually almost impossible to secure fruits from one or two\r\nisolated apricot trees, because the curculios will take them all. It is\r\npossible, also, that some of the varieties need cross-pollination.\r\n\r\nAmong the best kinds of apricots are Montgamet, Jackson, Royal, St.\r\nAmbroise, Early Golden, Harris, Roman (Fig. 274) and Moorpark. In the\r\nEast, apricots are commonly worked on plums, but they also thrive on\r\nthe peach.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Russian varieties, a few years ago, added to\r\nthe list several desirable kinds that have proved hardier and a little\r\nlater in blooming than the old kinds. The fruits of the Russian\r\nvarieties, while not as large as the other varieties, fully equal many\r\nof them in flavor, and they are very productive. They bear more\r\nprofusely and with less care than the old-fashioned and larger kinds.\r\n\r\nBlackberry.—In a general way, the planting and care of a blackberry\r\nplantation is the same as required by raspberries. From the fact that\r\nthey ripen later in the season, when droughts are most common, even\r\ngreater attention should be given to placing them in land that is\r\nretentive of moisture, and to providing an efficient mulch, which can\r\ngenerally best be secured with a cultivator. The smaller-growing kinds\r\n(as Early Harvest and Wilson) may be planted 4 x 7 ft., the\r\nrank-growing varieties (as Snyder) 6 x 8 ft. Thorough cultivation\r\nthrough-out the season will help in a material degree to hold the\r\nmoisture necessary to perfect a good crop. The soil should be\r\ncultivated very shallow, however, so as not to disturb the roots, as\r\nthe breaking of the roots starts a large number of suckers that have to\r\nbe cut out and destroyed. While hill culture (as recommended above) is\r\ndesirable for the garden, commercial growers generally use continuous\r\nrows.\r\n\r\nBlackberries, like dewberries and raspberries, bear but one crop on the\r\ncane. That is, canes which spring up this year bear next year. From 3\r\nto 6 canes are sufficient to be left in each hill. The superfluous ones\r\nare thinned out soon after they start from the ground. The old canes\r\nshould be cut out soon after fruiting, and burned. The new shoots\r\nshould be pinched back at the height of 2 or 3 ft. if the plants are to\r\nsupport themselves. If to be fastened to wires, they may be allowed to\r\ngrow throughout the season and be cut back when tied to the wires in\r\nwinter or early spring.\r\n\r\nBlackberry plants are sometimes laid down in cold climates,—the tops\r\nbeing bent over and held to the ground by earth or sods thrown on their\r\ntips (Fig. 155).\r\n\r\nThe most troublesome disease of the blackberry is orange rust\r\n(conspicuous on the under sides of the leaves), which often proves very\r\ndestructive, particularly to Kittatinny and a few other sorts. There is\r\nno remedy, and on the first appearance of the disease the infected\r\nplants should be dug up and burned.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of blackberries_.\r\n\r\nMany of the better varieties of blackberries are lacking in hardiness,\r\nand cannot be grown except in the more favorable localities. Snyder and\r\nTaylor are most generally successful, although Wilson and Early Harvest\r\nare often grown on a large scale for market, and do well with winter\r\nprotection. Eldorado is much like Snyder, that seems hardy and\r\nproductive. Erie, Minnewaski, Kittatinny, and Early King are in many\r\nsections large and valuable sorts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 275. Sour or pie cherries.]\r\n\r\nCherry.—Of cherries there are two common types, the sweet cherries and\r\nthe sour cherries. The sweet cherries are larger and taller-growing\r\ntrees. They comprise the varieties known as the hearts, bigarreaus, and\r\ndukes. The sour cherries (Fig. 275) include the various kinds of\r\nmorellos and pie cherries, and these usually ripen after the sweet\r\ncherries.\r\n\r\nThe sour cherries make low, round-headed trees. The fruits are\r\nextensively used for canning. Sour cherries thrive well on clay loams.\r\nThe sour cherry should be planted 18 by 18 ft. apart, in well-prepared,\r\nunder-drained soil. The trees may be slightly trimmed back each year,\r\nkeeping the head low and bushy.\r\n\r\nThe sweet cherries have proved disappointing in many instances from the\r\nrotting of the fruit. This may never be entirely avoided, but good\r\ncultivation, soil not too rich in nitrogen, attention to spraying, and\r\npicking the fruit when dry, will lessen the loss very much. In years of\r\nsevere rotting the fruit should be picked before it becomes fully ripe,\r\nplaced in a cool, airy room and allowed to color. It will be nearly as\r\nwell flavored as if left on the tree; and, as the fungus usually\r\nattacks only the ripe fruit, a considerable part of the crop may be\r\nsaved. Set the trees 25 or 30 ft. apart. Only very well-drained land\r\nshould be devoted to sweet cherries, preferably one of a somewhat\r\ngravelly nature.\r\n\r\nLeaf-blight is readily controlled by timely spraying with bordeaux\r\nmixture. The curculio or fruit worm may be controlled by jarring, as\r\nfor plums, or by spraying. The jarring process is seldom employed with\r\ncherries for the curculio, inasmuch as the poison spray seems, for some\r\nreason, to be particularly effective on these fruits.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of cherry_.\r\n\r\nOf the sour varieties, May Duke (Fig. 36), Richmond, Dyehouse,\r\nMontmorency, Ostheim, Hortense (Fig. 34), Late Kentish, Suda, and\r\nMorello (English Morello) (Fig. 35) are the most valuable. The\r\nfollowing sweet varieties are of value where they succeed: Rockport,\r\n(Yellow) Spanish, Elton, (Governor) Wood, Coe, Windsor, (Black)\r\nTartarian, and Downer.\r\n\r\nCranberry.—The growing of cranberries in artificial bogs is an American\r\nindustry. The common large cranberry of markets is also a peculiarly\r\nAmerican fruit, since it is unknown in other countries except as the\r\nfruit is shipped there.\r\n\r\nCranberries are grown in bogs, which may be flooded. The whole area is\r\nkept under water during the winter time, largely to prevent the plants\r\nfrom winter injury by the heaving and freezing and thawing of the bogs.\r\nFlooding is also employed at intervals for the purpose of drowning out\r\ninsects, mitigating drought, and protecting against frost and fires.\r\nThe ordinary practice is to choose a bog which has a creek running\r\nthrough it, or through which some creek or ditch may be diverted. At\r\nthe lower side of the bog flood-gates are provided, so that when the\r\ngates are shut, the water backs up and floods the area. It is best that\r\nthe bog be comparatively flat, so that the water will be of\r\napproximately equal depth over the whole area. At the shallowest places\r\nthe water should stand about a foot above the plants. The water is\r\nusually let on the bog early in December and kept on until April or\r\nearly May. No flooding is done during the rest of the year unless there\r\nis some particular occasion therefor.\r\n\r\nAll the wild and turfy growth should be taken off the bog before the\r\nvines are set. This is done either by digging it off and removing it\r\nbodily, or by drowning it out by means of a year’s flooding. The former\r\nmethod is generally considered to be the better. After the turfy growth\r\nis removed, the bog is smoothed, and covered 2 or 3 in. deep with clean\r\nsand. The vines are now set, the lower ends of them being shoved\r\nthrough the sand into the richer earth. In order to prevent a too rapid\r\nand tangled growth of vine, it is customary to resand the bog every\r\nthree or four years to a depth of one-fourth or one-half inch. When\r\nsanding is not practicable, the vines may be mown off when they become\r\ntoo luxuriant.\r\n\r\nThe plants for setting are merely cuttings or branches of the vines.\r\nThese cuttings may be 5 to 10 inches long. They are inserted into the\r\nground in a hole made by a crowbar or stick. They are usually planted\r\nat distances of 12 to 18 inches each way, and the vines are allowed to\r\ncover the entire ground as with a mat. In three years a good crop\r\nshould be secured, if the weeds and wild growth are kept down. A crop\r\nranges between 50 to 100 barrels per acre.\r\n\r\nCurrant.—As the currant is one of the hardiest and most productive of\r\nfruits in the North, so is it often neglected, the patch allowed to\r\nbecome foul with grass, never thinned or trimmed, the worms eating the\r\nleaves until, in the course of time, the plants weaken and die. Along\r\nthe fence is no place to plant currants, or, indeed, any other fruit;\r\nplant out in the open, at least 5 feet from anything that will\r\ninterfere with cultivation.\r\n\r\nNo fruit crop will respond more readily to good care than the currant.\r\nClean cultivation and a liberal use of manure or fertilizers will\r\ncertainly be followed by well-paying crops. One-or two-year-old plants\r\nmay be set, 4 by 6 feet. Trim the bush by cutting off most of the\r\nsuckers below the surface of the ground. The currant should have cool\r\nmoist soil. If the season is dry, a mulch of straw or leaves will\r\nassist the plants to establish themselves.\r\n\r\nCurrants are easily propagated by mature cuttings of the new or\r\nprevious year’s canes.\r\n\r\nThe red and white currants bear mostly on two-year-old or older wood. A\r\nsuccession of young shoots should be allowed to grow to take the place\r\nof the old bearing wood. Cut out the canes as they grow older. The\r\npartial shade afforded by a young orchard suits the currant well, and\r\nif the ground is in good condition, no bad results will follow to the\r\norchard, provided the currants are removed before the trees need the\r\nentire feeding space.\r\n\r\nA currant patch should continue in good bearing for 10 to 20 years, if\r\nproperly handled. One very important point is to keep the old, weak\r\ncanes cut out, and a succession of two to four new ones coming from the\r\nroot each year.\r\n\r\nTo combat the currant worm, spray thoroughly with Paris green to kill\r\nthe first brood, just as soon as holes can be seen in the lower\r\nleaves—usually before the plants are in bloom. For the second brood, if\r\nit appear, spray with white hellebore (p. 203). For borers, cut out and\r\nburn the affected canes.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of currants_.\r\n\r\nIn most sections the Red Dutch will be found to be the most\r\nsatisfactory variety, as the plants are much less injured by borers\r\nthan are Cherry (Plate XXIII), Fay, and Versailles, which are larger\r\nand better varieties, and are to be preferred in sections where the\r\nborers are not troublesome. Victoria is a valuable market sort where\r\nborers are numerous, as it is little injured by them. The same is also\r\ntrue of (Prince) Albert, which is little attacked by currant worms and\r\nis particularly valuable as a late sort. White Dutch and White Grape\r\nare valuable light-colored varieties, and (Black) Naples as a variety\r\nfor jelly. London (London Market) is also proving to be satisfactory in\r\nsome sections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 276. Lucretia dewberry.]\r\n\r\nDewberry.—The dewberry may be called an early trailing blackberry. The\r\nculture is very simple. Support should be given to the canes, as they\r\nare very slender and rank growers. A wire trellis or large-meshed\r\nfence-wire answers admirably; or (and this is the better general\r\nmethod) they may be tied to stakes. The fruits are large and showy,\r\nwhich, combined with their earliness, makes them desirable; but they\r\nare usually deficient in flavor. The Lucretia (Fig. 276) is the leading\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nLay the canes on the ground in winter. In the spring tie all the canes\r\nfrom each plant to a stake. After fruiting, cut the old canes and burn\r\nthem (as for blackberries). In the meantime, the young canes (for next\r\nyear’s fruiting) are growing. These may be tied up as they grow, to be\r\nout of the way of the cultivator. Dewberries are one to two weeks\r\nearlier than blackberries.\r\n\r\nFig.—The fig is little grown in the East except as a curiosity, but on\r\nthe Pacific coast it has gained considerable prominence as an orchard\r\nfruit. Figs will stand considerable frost, and seedling or inferior\r\nvarieties grow out-of-doors without protection as far north as\r\nVirginia. Many of the varieties fruit on young sprouts, and, inasmuch\r\nas the roots will stand considerable cold, these varieties will often\r\ngive a few figs in the northern states. Figs have been fruited in the\r\nopen ground in Michigan. In regions having ten degrees of frost, the\r\nfig should be laid down in winter. For this purpose the plants are\r\npruned to branch from the ground, and the soft tops are bent to the\r\nsurface and covered with earth. In commercial cultivation, fig trees\r\ngrow large, and they stand 18 to 25 feet apart; but in gardens where\r\nthey are to be bent over, they are to be kept as bushes.\r\n\r\nAdriatic is the most commonly grown white fig. Among the other\r\nvarieties are California Black or Mission Fig, Brown Ischia, Brown\r\nTurkey, White Ischia, and Celeste (Celestial).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 277. One of the English-American gooseberries.]\r\n\r\nGooseberry.—The gooseberry differs little from the currant in its\r\nrequirements as to soil, pruning, and general care. The plants should\r\nbe set 3 to 4 feet apart; rows 5 to 7 feet apart. Select a rich, rather\r\nmoist soil. The tops need no winter protection. If mildew and worms are\r\nto be kept in check, spraying must be begun with the very first sign of\r\ntrouble and be thoroughly done.\r\n\r\nThe propagation of the gooseberry is similar to that of the currant,\r\nalthough the practice of earthing up a whole plant, causing every\r\nbranch thus covered to throw out roots, is practiced with the European\r\nvarieties. The rooted branches are cut off the following spring and\r\nplanted in nursery rows or sometimes directly in the field. In order to\r\nsucceed with this method, the plant should have been cut back to the\r\nground so that all the shoots are yearling.\r\n\r\nSince the advent of the practice of spraying with fungicides to prevent\r\nmildew, the culture of the gooseberry has increased. There is now no\r\nreason why, with a little care, good crops of many of the best English\r\nvarieties may not be grown.\r\n\r\nA large part of the gooseberry crop is picked green for culinary\r\npurposes. Several of the English varieties and their derivatives have\r\nproved of value, having larger fruits than the natives (Fig. 277).\r\n\r\n_Varieties of gooseberries_.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary use the Downing can generally be recommended. It is hardy,\r\nproductive, of fair size, and greenish white in color. Houghton is even\r\nmore hardy and productive, but the fruit is rather small and of a dark\r\nred color. Among the varieties of European origin that can be\r\nsuccessfully grown, if the mildew can be prevented, are Industry,\r\nTriumph, Keepsake, Lancashire Lad, and Golden Prolific. Among other\r\nvarieties that are promising are Champion, Columbus, Chautauqua, and\r\nJosselyn (Red Jacket).\r\n\r\nGrape.—One of the surest of fruit crops is the grape, a crop each year\r\nbeing reasonably certain after the third year from the time of setting\r\nthe vines; and the good amateur kinds are numerous.\r\n\r\nThe grape does well on any soil that is under good cultivation and well\r\ndrained. A soil with considerable clay is better under these\r\ncircumstances than a light, sandy loam. The exposure should be to the\r\nsun; and the place should admit of cultivation on all sides.\r\n\r\nFor planting, 1-or 2-year-old vines should be used, being set either in\r\nthe fall or early spring. At planting, the vine is cut back to 3 or 4\r\neyes, and the roots are well shortened in. The hole in which the plant\r\nis to be set should be large enough to allow a full spreading of the\r\nroots. If the season should be dry, a mulch of coarse litter may be\r\nspread around the vine. If all the buds start, the strongest one or two\r\nmay be allowed to grow. The canes arising from these buds should be\r\nstaked and allowed to grow through the season; or in large plantations\r\nthe first-year canes may be allowed to lie on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe second year one cane should be cut back to the same number of eyes\r\nas the first year. After growth begins in the spring, two of the\r\nstrongest buds should be allowed to remain. These two canes now arising\r\nmay be grown to a single stake through the second summer, or they may\r\nbe spread horizontally on a trellis. These are the canes that form the\r\npermanent arms or parts of the vine. From them start the upright shoots\r\nwhich, in succeeding years, are to bear the fruits.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the pruning of grapes, the operator must fully\r\ngrasp this principle: _Fruit is borne on wood of the present season,\r\nwhich arises from wood of the previous season_. To illustrate: A\r\ngrowing shoot, or cane, of 1909 makes buds. In 1910 a shoot arises from\r\neach bud; and near the base of these shoots the grapes are borne (1 to\r\n4 clusters on each). While every bud on the 1909 shoot may produce\r\nshoots or canes in 1910, only the strongest of these new canes will\r\nbear fruit. The skilled grape-grower can tell by the looks of his cane\r\n(as he prunes it in winter) which buds will give rise to the\r\ngrape-producing wood the following season. The larger and stronger buds\r\nusually give best results; but if the cane itself is very big and\r\nstout, or if it is very weak and slender, he does not expect good\r\nresults from any of its buds. A hard, well-ripened cane the diameter of\r\na man’s little finger is the ideal size.\r\n\r\nAnother principle to be mastered is this: _A vine should bear only a\r\nlimited number of clusters_,—say from 30 to 80. A shoot bears clusters\r\nnear its base; beyond these clusters the shoot grows on into a long,\r\nleafy cane. An average of two clusters may be reckoned to a shoot. If\r\nthe vine is strong enough to bear 60 clusters, 30 good buds must be\r\nleft at the pruning (which is done from December to late February).\r\n\r\nThe essential operation of pruning a grape vine, therefore, is each\r\nyear to cut back a limited number of good canes to a few buds, and to\r\ncut off entirely all the remaining canes or wood of the previous\r\nseason’s growth. If a cane is cut back to 2 or 3 buds, the stub-like\r\npart which remains is called a spur. Present systems, however, cut each\r\ncane back to 8 or 10 buds (on strong varieties), and 3 or 4 canes are\r\nleft,—all radiating from near the head or trunk of the vine. The top of\r\nthe vine does not grow bigger from year to year, after it has once\r\ncovered the trellis, but is cut back to practically the same number of\r\nbuds each year. Since these buds are on new wood, it is evident that\r\nthey are each year farther and farther removed from the head of the\r\nvine. In order to obviate this difficulty, new canes are taken out each\r\nyear or two from near the head of the vine, and the 2-year-or\r\n3-year-old wood is cut away.\r\n\r\nThe training of grapes is a different matter. A dozen different systems\r\nof training may be practiced on the same trellis and from the same\r\nstyle of pruning,—for training is only the disposition or arrangement\r\nof the parts.\r\n\r\nOn arbors, it is best to carry one permanent arm or trunk from each\r\nroot over the framework to the peak. Each year the canes are cut back\r\nto short spurs (of 2 or 3 buds) along the sides of this trunk.\r\n\r\nGrapes are set from 6 to 8 feet apart in rows which are 8 to 10 feet\r\napart. A trellis made of 2 or 3 wires is the best support. Slat\r\ntrellises catch too much wind and blow down. Avoid stimulating manures.\r\nIn very cold climates, the vines may be taken off the trellis in early\r\nwinter and laid on the ground and lightly covered with earth. Along the\r\nboundaries of home lots, where grapes are often planted, little is to\r\nbe expected in the way of fruit because the ground is not well tilled.\r\n\r\nThe grape is subject to many insects and diseases, some of which are\r\nvery destructive. The black-rot is the most usual trouble. See p. 209.\r\n\r\nTo produce bunches of high quality and free from rot and frost injury,\r\ngrapes are sometimes bagged. When the grapes are about half grown, the\r\nbunch is covered with a grocer’s manila bag. The bags remain until the\r\nfruit is ripe. The grapes usually mature earlier in the bags. The top\r\nof the bag is split, and the flaps are secured over the branch with a\r\npin; Figs. 278, 279, 280 explain the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 278 Bag ready to be applied.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 279 The second stage in adjusting the bag.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 280 The bagging complete.]\r\n\r\nIn all the above discussion, the so-called native grapes alone are\r\nconsidered. In California, the European or vinifera types are grown,\r\nthe requirements of which are radically different from those of the\r\neastern kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. Wall-training of a pear tree. XXII. Wall-training of a pear tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Varieties of grapes_.\r\n\r\nUnder nearly all conditions, the Concord will be a valuable black\r\nvariety, although Worden, which is a few days earlier, may be preferred\r\nby many. Moore (Moore Early) has been our best very early black\r\nvariety, but is likely to be superseded by Campbell, which is a\r\nstronger vine, more productive, bunches larger, fruit of better\r\nquality, and of superior keeping qualities, making it valuable for\r\nshipping purposes. Catawba, Delaware, and Brighton are among the best\r\nred varieties, although Agawam and Salem are much used. Winchell (Green\r\nMountain) is the best early white variety, and in most sections\r\nNiagara, a late white sort, does well. Diamond (Moore Diamond) is a\r\nwhite grape of better quality than Niagara.\r\n\r\n_Grapes under glass_ (S.W. Fletcher).\r\n\r\nThe European grapes rarely thrive out of doors in eastern America.\r\nGrape houses are necessary, with or without artificial heat. Fruit for\r\nhome use may be grown very satisfactorily in a cold grapery (without\r\nartificial heat). A simple lean-to against the south side of a building\r\nor wall is cheap and serviceable. When a separate building is desired,\r\nan even-span house running north and south is preferable. There is no\r\nadvantage in having a curved roof, except as a matter of looks. A\r\ncompost of four parts rotted turf to one of manure is laid on a sloping\r\ncement bottom outside the house, making a border 12 feet wide and 2\r\nfeet deep. The cement may be replaced with rubble on well-drained\r\nsoils, but it is a poor makeshift. Every three years the upper 6 inches\r\nof the border should be renewed with manure. The border inside the\r\nhouse is prepared likewise. Two-year-old potted vines are planted about\r\n4 feet apart in a single row. Part of the roots go through a crevice in\r\nthe wall to the outer border and part remain inside; or all may go\r\noutside if the house is desired for other purposes. One strong cane is\r\ntrained to a wire trellis hanging at least 18 inches from the glass,\r\nand is cut back to 3 feet the first year, 6 the second, and 9 the\r\nthird. Do not be in a hurry to get a long cane. Pruning is on the spur\r\nsystem, as recommended for arbors on p. 430. The vines are usually laid\r\non the ground for winter and covered with leaves or wrapped with cloth.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the buds swell in early spring, tie the vines to the trellis\r\nand start out one shoot from each spur, rubbing off all others. After\r\nthe berries begin to color, however, it is better to leave all further\r\ngrowth to shade the fruit. Pinch back each of these laterals two joints\r\nbeyond the second bunch. To keep down red spider and thrips, the\r\nfoliage should be sprayed with water every bright morning except during\r\nthe blooming season. At least one-third of the berries should be\r\nthinned from each bunch; do not be afraid of taking out too many. Water\r\nthe inside border frequently all through the summer, and the outside\r\noccasionally if the season is dry. Mildew may appear in July. The best\r\npreventives are to syringe faithfully, admit air freely, and sprinkle\r\nsulfur on the ground.\r\n\r\nFruit may be kept fresh on the vines in a warm (or artificially heated)\r\ngrapery until late December; in a coldhouse it must be picked before\r\nfrost. After the fruit is off, ventilate from top and bottom and\r\nwithhold water, so as thoroughly to ripen the wood. Along in November\r\nthe canes are pruned, covered with straw or wrapped with mats and laid\r\ndown till spring. Black Hamburg is superior to all other varieties for\r\na cold grapery; Bowood Muscat, Muscat of Alexandria, and Chasselas\r\nMusque may be added in the warmhouse. Good vines will live and bear\r\nalmost indefinitely.\r\n\r\nMulberry.—Both for fruit and ornament the mulberry should be more\r\ngenerally planted. Even if the fruit is not to the taste, the tree is\r\nnaturally open-centered and round-headed, and is an interesting\r\nsubject; some of the varieties have finely cut leaves. The fruits are\r\nin great demand by the birds, and after they begin to ripen the\r\nstrawberry beds and cherry trees are freer from robins and other\r\nfruit-eating birds. For this reason alone they are a valuable tree for\r\nthe fruit-grower. Trees may be purchased cheaper than one can propagate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf planted in orchard form, place them 25 to 30 feet apart. About the\r\nborders of a place they can go closer. The Russian varieties are often\r\nplanted for windbreaks, for they are very hardy and thrive under the\r\ngreatest neglect; and for this purpose they may be planted 8 to 20 feet\r\napart. The Russians make excellent screens. They stand clipping well.\r\nThe fruit of the Russians varies in quality, as the trees are usually\r\ndirectly from seed; but now and then a tree bears excellent fruit.\r\n\r\nNew American, Trowbridge, and Thorburn are leading kinds of\r\nfruit-bearing mulberries for the North. The true Downing is not hardy\r\nin the northern states; but New American is often sold under this name.\r\nMulberries thrive in any good soil, and need no special treatment.\r\n\r\nNuts.—The nut trees demand too much room for most home-ground fruit\r\nplantations, although they are also useful for windbreaks and shade.\r\nThe hickories, all American, make excellent lawn trees, and should be\r\nbetter known. The filberts and cobnuts, small trees or bushes, are not\r\nsuccessfully grown in this country except in very special cases.\r\n\r\nThe commercial nut-growing in the United States and Canada is chiefly\r\nof almonds, walnuts, and pecans, with some attempt at chestnuts. Of\r\nthese the chestnut is the most adaptable for home places in the\r\nnortheastern section.\r\n\r\nOf chestnuts there are three types in cultivation: the European, the\r\nJapanese, and the American. The American, or native chestnuts, of which\r\nthere are several improved varieties, are the hardiest and most\r\nreliable, and the nuts are the sweetest, but they are also the\r\nsmallest. The Japanese varieties are usually injured by the winter in\r\ncentral New York. The European varieties are somewhat hardier, and some\r\nof the varieties will thrive in the northern states. Chestnuts are very\r\neasily grown, although the bark disease now threatens them. They\r\nusually bear better when two or more trees are planted near each other.\r\nSprouts in old chestnut clearings are often allowed to remain, and\r\nsometimes they are grafted to the improved varieties. The young trees\r\nmay be grafted in the spring by the whip-graft or cleft-graft method;\r\nbut the cions should be perfectly dormant, and the operation should be\r\nvery carefully done. Even with the best workmanship, a considerable\r\npercentage of the grafts are likely to fail or to break off after two\r\nor three years. The most popular single variety of chestnut is the\r\nParagon, which bears large and excellent nuts when the tree is very\r\nyoung. When the home ground is large enough, two or three of these\r\ntrees should be planted near the borders.\r\n\r\nOrange.—Oranges are grown extensively in Florida, in places along the\r\nGulf, and in many parts of California, but in the most favored sections\r\nthere is occasionally some injury from cold or frost to the trees or\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nThe soil preferred for oranges in California is a rich, deep alluvium,\r\navoiding hard-pan or adobe subsoils. Stagnant water in the subsoil is a\r\nfatal defect. Although they can be grown near the ocean at a lower\r\nlevel, an elevation of 600 to 1200 feet is generally desirable. While\r\nsouthern California is particularly adapted to orange culture, the\r\nfruit is successfully raised along the foot-hills of the San Joaquin\r\nand Sacramento valleys and in other parts of the state.\r\n\r\nIn Florida, pine lands with a clay subsoil are generally preferred for\r\noranges, but if properly handled, good results can be obtained from\r\nhammock land. As elevated spots cannot be secured, a timber belt\r\nsurrounding the orchard or along the north and west sides is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe distance for the large-growing kinds of orange in the orchard is\r\nfrom 25 to 30 feet each way, but the half-dwarf kinds, such as Bahia or\r\nWashington Navel, may be as close as 20 feet each way, although 25 feet\r\nwill be desirable. If the roots are sacked, the trees should be placed\r\nin the hole without removing the covering, and the soil should then be\r\npacked about them; but if they are puddled, a mound should be made in\r\nthe bottom of the hole. In the center an opening should be made into\r\nwhich the tap-root can be inserted. After the soil has been firmly\r\npacked about it, the other roots should be spread out and the hole\r\nfilled with good soil, packing it carefully. Care should be taken that\r\nthe roots are not exposed in handling the trees, and if the weather is\r\nhot and dry, the tops should be shaded. Water may often be used with\r\ngood results in settling the soil about the roots.\r\n\r\nWhen transplanted, the tops should be cut back in proportion to the\r\namount of roots lost in digging the trees. The head is usually started\r\nwith the branches about 2 feet from the ground. Each year while the\r\ntrees are small, the strong shoots should be cut back to preserve a\r\nsymmetrical form and the weak and surplus shoots should be removed.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of orange orchards should be the same as recommended\r\nfor other fruits, except that as they grow in hot, dry climates, it\r\nshould be even more thorough, that the evaporation of moisture from the\r\nsoil may be reduced to a minimum. California growers have found that by\r\nfrequent shallow cultivation they can reduce the amount of water that\r\nmust be applied by irrigation, and that frequent tillage and a little\r\nwater will give better results than little or no cultivation and a\r\nlarge amount of water. The amount of water required will also depend on\r\nthe season and the character of the soil. Thus on strong soils and\r\nafter a heavy rainfall no irrigation will be required, while sandy\r\nsoils will need irrigating as often as once in three or four weeks from\r\nMay to October. As a general rule, two or three irrigations in a season\r\nwill be ample. When used at all, water should be applied in sufficient\r\nquantities to wet down to the roots of the trees. Frequent scanty\r\nwaterings may do much harm. The water is usually applied in furrows,\r\nand for young trees there should be one on either side of each row, but\r\nas the roots extend the number should be increased, until when five or\r\nsix years old the entire orchard should be irrigated from furrows 4 or\r\n5 feet apart. In Florida, irrigation is not practiced.\r\n\r\nCover-cropping in winter is now common in Florida and California, some\r\nof the leguminous crops being used.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of the orange_.\r\n\r\nAmong the best varieties are: Bahia, commonly known as Washington\r\nNavel, Thompson Improved, Maltese Blood, Mediterranean Sweet, Paper\r\nRind St. Michael, and Valencia. Homosassa, Magnum Bonum, Nonpareil,\r\nBoone, Parson Brown, Pineapple, and Hart are favorites in Florida. The\r\ntangerines and mandarins, or the “kid-glove” oranges, have a thin rind\r\nthat is easily detached from the rather dry pulp. Orange trees are\r\nfrequently injured by various scale insects, but for several of the\r\nmost troublesome kinds, insect parasites have been found that keep them\r\npartially or wholly in check, and for others the trees are sprayed, or\r\nfumigated with hydrocyanic acid gas.\r\n\r\nPeach.—Given the proper exposure, peaches may be fruited in many\r\nsections where now it is thought impossible to have a crop. It is\r\nusually the practice of the amateur to set peach trees in the shelter\r\nof some building, exposed on the south or east to the sun, and “in a\r\npocket” as regards winds. This should be reversed, except in the close\r\nvicinity of large bodies of water. The fruit-buds of peaches will stand\r\nvery cold weather when perfectly dormant, often as low as 12° or 18°\r\nbelow zero in New York; but if the buds once become swollen,\r\ncomparatively light freezing will destroy the crop. Therefore, if the\r\ntrees be set on elevations where a constant air drainage may be\r\nobtained, sheltered, if at all, on the south and east from the warming\r\ninfluence of the sun, the buds will remain dormant until the ground\r\nbecomes warm, and the chances of a failure will be lessened. This\r\nadvice applies mostly to interior sections.\r\n\r\nA well-drained, sandy loam or gravelly soil suits the peach better than\r\na heavy soil; but if the heavier soil is well drained, good crops may\r\nbe secured.\r\n\r\nPeaches are short-lived at best, and one should be satisfied with three\r\nor four crops from each tree. They bear young, usually a partial crop\r\nthe third year. If a crop may be had every other year until the trees\r\nare eight or ten years old, they will have well repaid the effort of\r\ncultivation. But they often bear twice this long. Young trees may be\r\nset every four or five years to replace older ones, thus having trees\r\nat a bearing age at all times on a small place. Trees should be set 14\r\nto 18 feet apart each way.\r\n\r\nPeach trees are always bought when they are one year old, that is, one\r\nyear from the bud. For example, the bud is inserted in the fall of\r\n1909. It remains dormant until the spring of 1910, when it pushes into\r\nvigorous growth; and in the fall of 1910 the tree is ready for sale.\r\nPeach trees that are more than a year old are scarcely worth the\r\nbuying. It is a common practice, when setting peach trees, to prune\r\nthem back to a whip, leaving a stub bearing not more than one bud where\r\neach branch is cut off.\r\n\r\nThe three great enemies of the peach are the borer, the yellows, and\r\nthe curculio.\r\n\r\nThe borer is best handled by digging it out every spring and fall.\r\nTrees attacked by the borer have an exudation of gum about the crown.\r\nIf the borers are dug out twice a year, they will not get sufficient\r\nstart to make the operation very laborious. It is the only sure way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 281. Seckel pear.]\r\n\r\nThe yellows is a communicable disease, the cause of which is not\r\ndefinitely known. It shows itself in the fruit ripening prematurely,\r\nwith distinct red spots which extend through the flesh, and later by\r\nthe throwing out of fine, branching, twiggy tufts along the main\r\nbranches (Fig. 215). The only treatment is to pull out the trees and\r\nburn them. Other trees may be set in the same places.\r\n\r\nThe curculio must be captured by jarring on sheets (see _Plum_).\r\n\r\n_Varieties of the peach_.\r\n\r\nFor home use it is advisable to provide varieties that will ripen in\r\nsuccession, but for market purposes, in most sections, the medium and\r\nlate kinds should be most extensively planted. Although there are many\r\nvarieties that have a local reputation, but are not commonly found in\r\nthe nurseries, the following kinds are well known, and can be generally\r\ngrown with success: Alexander, Hale Early, Rivers, St. John, Bishop,\r\nConnett (Southern Early), Carman, Crawford (Early and Late), Oldmixon,\r\nLewis, Champion, Sneed, Greensboro, Kalamazoo, Stump, Elberta, Ede\r\n(Capt. Ede), Stevens (Stevens’ Rareripe), Crosby, Gold Drop, Reeves,\r\nChairs, Smock, Salway, and Levy (Henrietta).\r\n\r\nPear.—No fruit plantation should be considered complete without trees\r\nof various kinds of pears, ripening fruits from early in August till\r\nwinter. The late varieties are generally good keepers, and extend the\r\nseason into February, thus supplying fruit for six or seven months.\r\n\r\nAs the pear grows to perfection on quince, the dwarf tree is peculiarly\r\nadapted to planting on small home grounds, and is often used as a\r\nboundary plant, or to serve the purpose of a screen. These dwarf trees\r\nshould be set deep—4 to 6 inches below the union—to prevent the stock\r\nfrom growing. Dwarf trees may be set as near together as 10 to 16 feet,\r\nwhile the standard or tall-growing pears should be set 18 to 25 feet\r\napart. Trees are planted when two or three years old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 282. Duchesse d’Angoulême pear.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 283. The Kieffer pear.]\r\n\r\nThe pear thrives on clay soil, if well under-drained, and for this\r\nreason may succeed in places where other fruits might fail. A good,\r\nsteady growth should be maintained, but the use of nitrogenous manures\r\nshould be avoided, as they tend to make a rank growth and invite\r\nattacks of pear blight, which is the worst enemy of the pear (p. 211).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 284. Kieffer pear.]\r\n\r\n_Varieties of the pear_.\r\n\r\nAs a selection to supply a succession of varieties throughout the\r\nseason, the following list is recommended:—\r\n\r\n_Early_.—Summer Doyenne, Bloodgood, Clapp, Osband, Elizabeth (Manning’s\r\nElizabeth).\r\n\r\n_Autumn_.—Bartlett, Boussock, Flemish (Flemish Beauty), Buffum, Howell,\r\nSeckel (Fig. 281), Louise Bonne, Angoulême (Duchesse d’Angoulême) (Fig.\r\n282), Sheldon.\r\n\r\n_Winter_.—Anjou, Clairgeau, Lawrence, Kieffer (Figs. 283, 284), Winter\r\nNelis, and Easter Beurre.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary market purposes the following have been proved valuable:\r\nBartlett, Howell, Anjou, Clairgeau, and Lawrence. In the central and\r\nsouthern states, Kieffer is grown successfully. For home use this\r\nvariety is not to be recommended in the North, because of its poor\r\nquality and smaller size.\r\n\r\nFor growing as dwarfs, Angoulême (Duchesse d’Angoulême), Louise Bonne,\r\nAnjou, Clairgeau, and Lawrence are most popular, but many other\r\nvarieties thrive on the quince.\r\n\r\nPlum.—Of plums there are three general or common types: first, the\r\ncommon Domestica or European plum, which gives rise to all the older\r\nvarieties, like Lombard, Bradshaw, Green Gage, the Prunes, the Egg\r\nplums, the Damsons, and the like; second, the Japanese plums, which\r\nhave become popular within the last twenty years, and which are adapted\r\nto a wider range of country than the Domesticas; third, the native\r\nplums of several species or types, which are adapted to the plains, the\r\nmiddle and southern states, and some kinds to the cold North.\r\n\r\nWherever the Domestica and Japanese plums can be grown, the native\r\nplums are not destined to become popular; but many of the natives are\r\nmuch hardier than others, and are therefore adapted to regions in which\r\nthe Domestica and Japanese are not safe. Others of them are well\r\nadapted to the middle and southern states. The Domestica and Japanese\r\nplums are considerably hardier than peaches, but not so hardy as the\r\napple. The northern limit of their general cultivation is the southern\r\npeninsula of Michigan, central and southern Ontario, central New York,\r\nand central New England.\r\n\r\nPlums thrive on a great variety of soils, but they do better, as a\r\nrule, on those that are rather heavy and have a considerable content of\r\nclay. In fact, many of the varieties will thrive on clay as hard as\r\nthat in which pears will grow. On the other hand, they often thrive\r\nwell in light, and even almost sandy soils.\r\n\r\nThe trees are set when they are two and three years from the bud. It is\r\npreferable to have plum trees on stocks of the same species, but it is\r\nnot always possible to secure them at the nurseries. In the South,\r\nplums are worked mostly on peach roots, and these make excellent trees\r\nwhere the climate is not too severe, and especially on the lighter\r\nlands on which they are planted in the South. In the North the larger\r\npart of the plum stocks are grown on the Myrobalan plum roots. This\r\nMyrobalan is an Old World species of plum, of smaller growth than the\r\nDomestica. This stock, therefore, tends to dwarf the tree, and it is\r\nalso likely to throw up sprouts from the roots.\r\n\r\nPlum trees are set 12 to 18 feet apart. Many growers like to set them 8\r\nfeet apart in rows, and have the rows from 16 to 20 feet apart.\r\n\r\nPlums are pruned much the same as apples and pears. That is, the top is\r\nthinned out from year to year, and all superfluous branches and broken\r\nor diseased wood are removed. If the soil is very strong and the trees\r\nare close together, it may be well to head them in a little each year,\r\nespecially those varieties which grow very strong and robust.\r\n\r\n_Pests and diseases_.\r\n\r\nThere are four leading difficulties in the growing of\r\nplums—leaf-blight, fruit-rot, black-knot, and curculio.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-blight usually appears about midsummer, the leaves becoming\r\nspotted and dropping off. The remedy is to spray thoroughly with\r\nbordeaux mixture, beginning soon after the fruits have set, and before\r\nthe trouble begins to show.\r\n\r\nThe fruit-rot may be prevented by the same means—that is, by spraying\r\nwith bordeaux mixture. It is usually best to begin just after the\r\nfruits are well set. A very important consideration in the checking of\r\nthis disease is to thin the fruit so that it does not hang in clusters.\r\nIf one fruit touches another, the rot spreads from fruit to fruit in\r\nspite of the spraying. Some varieties, as Lombard and Abundance, are\r\nspecially susceptible to this injury.\r\n\r\nThe black-knot is best kept in check by cutting out the knots whenever\r\nthey can be seen, and burning them. As soon as the leaves drop, the\r\norchard should be gone over and all knots taken out. Orchards that are\r\nthoroughly sprayed with bordeaux mixture for the leaf-blight and\r\nfruit-rot fungus are less liable to attacks of black-knot.\r\n\r\nThe curculio, or the insect which is the parent of the worms in the\r\nfruit, is the inveterate enemy of the plum and other stone fruits. The\r\nmature beetle lays the eggs in the fruits when they are very small,\r\nusually beginning its work about as soon as the flowers fall. These\r\neggs soon hatch, and the little maggot bores into the fruit. Those\r\nfruits that are attacked whilst very young ordinarily fall from the\r\ntree, but those attacked when they are half or more grown, may adhere\r\nto the tree, but remain wormy and gummy at the picking time. The mature\r\nbeetles are sluggish in the mornings, and are easily jarred from the\r\ntrees. Taking advantage of this fact, the fruit-grower may jar them on\r\nsheets; or, in large orchards, into a large canvas hopper, which is\r\nwheeled from tree to tree upon a wheelbarrow-like frame, and under the\r\napex of which is a tin can into which the insects roll. There is a slit\r\nor opening in one side of the hopper, which allows the tree to stand\r\nnearly in the middle of the canvas. The operator then gives the tree\r\ntwo or three sharp jars with a padded pole or mallet. The edges of the\r\nhopper are then quickly shaken with the hands and the insects roll down\r\ninto the tin receptacle. In this receptacle there is kerosene oil, or\r\nit may be emptied from time to time. Just how long this machine is to\r\nbe run in the orchard will depend entirely on circumstances. It is\r\nadvisable to use the catcher soon after the blossoms fall, for the\r\npurpose of finding out how abundant the insects are. If a few insects\r\nare caught from each tree, there is indication that there are enough of\r\nthe pests to make serious trouble. If after a few days the insects seem\r\nto have disappeared, it will not be necessary to continue the hunt. In\r\nsome years, especially in those succeeding a very heavy crop, it may be\r\nnecessary to run the curculio-catcher every morning for four or five\r\nweeks; but, as a rule, it will not be necessary to use it oftener than\r\ntwo or three times a week during that season; and sometimes the season\r\nmay be shortened by one half. The insects fall most readily when the\r\nweather is cool, and it is best, therefore, to get through the whole\r\norchard, if possible, before noon. On cloudy days, however, the insects\r\nmay be caught all day. A smart man can attend to 300 or 400\r\nfull-bearing trees in six hours if the ground has been well rolled or\r\nfirmed, as it should be before the bugging operation begins. The same\r\ntreatment applies to the saving of peaches and rarely, also, of sour\r\ncherries.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of the plum_.\r\n\r\nThe following varieties of European origin will be found desirable for\r\ngrowing in the northern and eastern states: Bradshaw, Imperial Gage,\r\nLombard, McLaughlin, Pond, Quackenbos, Copper, Jefferson, Italian Prune\r\n(Fellenberg), Shropshire, Golden Drop (Coe Golden Drop), Bavay or Reine\r\nClaude, Grand Duke, Monarch.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Japanese varieties are also well adapted to growing in\r\nthese sections, as well as in the states farther south. The trees are\r\ngenerally hardy, but they bloom early, and are likely to be injured by\r\nlate frosts in some localities. Among the better kinds are the Red\r\nJune, Abundance, Chabot, Burbank, and Satsuma.\r\n\r\nFew of the above sorts are hardy in the Northwest, and growers there\r\nhave to rely on varieties of native species. Among these are: Forest\r\nGarden, Wyant, De Soto, Rollingstone, Weaver, Quaker, and Hawkeye.\r\nFarther south still other classes of plums have been introduced, among\r\nthem being Wildgoose, Clinton, Moreman, Miner, and Golden Beauty. And\r\nstill farther south, Transparent, Texas Belle (Paris Belle), Newman,\r\nLone Star, and El Paso are grown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 285. Meech Quince (Meech’s Prolific).]\r\n\r\nQuince.—Although not largely grown, quinces generally find a ready\r\nsale, and they are desirable for home use. The trees are usually\r\nplanted about 12 feet each way, and may be trained either in a shrub or\r\ntree form, but it will generally be best to grow them with a short\r\ntrunk. They succeed best on a deep, moist, and fertile soil. They\r\nrequire much the same care as the pear. The insects and diseases by\r\nwhich they are attacked are also the same as for that fruit. Blight is\r\nparticularly bad. The fruit is borne on short shoots of the same\r\nseason, and strong heading-in of the growth in winter removes a good\r\npart of the buds from which the shoots arise. The Orange is the most\r\ncommon variety, but Champion, Meech (Fig. 285), and Rea are sometimes\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 286. A rooting tip of the black raspberry.]\r\n\r\nRaspberry.—Both the red and black raspberries are essentials of a good\r\ngarden. A few plants of each will produce a supply of berries for a\r\nfamily through six or eight weeks, provided both early and late\r\nvarieties are planted.\r\n\r\nA cool situation, soil that will hold moisture without being wet, and\r\nthorough preparation of the ground, are the conditions necessary to\r\nsuccess. The blackcap raspberries should be set 3 to 4 feet apart, the\r\nrows 6 or 7 feet; the red varieties 3 feet apart, the rows 5 feet\r\napart. Spring setting is usually preferable.\r\n\r\nThe shoots of raspberries sent up one season fruit and die the\r\nfollowing year, as in blackberries and dewberries.\r\n\r\nMost of the blackcap varieties naturally throw out side branches the\r\nfirst season, and with such it is a good plan to pinch back the new\r\ncanes as soon as they have reached a height of 2 to 3 feet, according\r\nto the full height of the variety. This will hasten the throwing out of\r\nside shoots, upon which fruit will be borne the following year. As soon\r\nas severe freezing weather is over in the spring, these side shoots\r\nshould be cut back 9 to 12 inches, according to the strength of the\r\ncanes and the number of side branches upon them.\r\n\r\nThe same method of pruning is advisable with red varieties like\r\nCuthbert, which naturally branch freely. Other sorts, like King,\r\nHansell, Marlboro, Turner, and Thwack, that seldom branch, should not\r\nbe pinched back in summer, as, even though this might induce them to\r\nsend out shoots, the branches will be weak, and if they survive the\r\nwinter, will produce less fruit than would the strong buds upon the\r\nmain canes had they not been forced into growth.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the crop has been gathered, and the old canes are dead, they\r\nshould be removed, and at the same time all of the surplus new shoots\r\nshould be cut away. From four to five good canes will be sufficient for\r\neach hill, while in rows the number may be from two to three in each\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nPruned in this way, nearly all varieties will have stems sufficiently\r\nlarge to support themselves, but as there will be more or less breaking\r\ndown and injury to the fruit from the bending over of the canes, many\r\ngrowers prefer to support them by means of stakes or trellises. Stakes\r\nmay be set in each hill, or for matted rows stout stakes 3 feet high\r\nare driven at intervals of 40 feet and a No. 10 galvanized wire is\r\nstretched along the row, to which the canes are tied. It would be a\r\nsaving of labor if a wire is stretched either side of the row, as then\r\nno tying will be required.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. Cherry currant. XXIII. Cherry currant.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to secure new plants, the ends of the branches of the\r\nblack varieties should be covered with soil about the middle of August,\r\nwhen the tips are seen to divide into several slender shoots, and to\r\ntake root (Fig. 286); these can be taken up and planted the following\r\nspring. While the suckers that spring from the roots of red varieties\r\n(Fig. 287) may be used in propagating them, it will be better to use\r\nplants grown from root-cuttings, as they will have much better roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 287. Sprouting habit of red raspberry.]\r\n\r\nRaspberries may be bent over to the ground so that the snow will\r\nprotect them, in severe climates.\r\n\r\nFor red rust, pull out the plant, root and branch, and burn it. Short\r\nrotations—fruiting the plants only two or three years—and burning the\r\nold canes and trimmings, will do much to keep raspberry plantations\r\nhealthy. Spraying will have some effect in combating anthracnose.\r\n\r\n_Varieties of raspberries_.\r\n\r\nOf the black sorts the following will be found desirable: Palmer,\r\nConrath, Kansas, and Eureka, which ripen in the order named. In some\r\nsections the Gregg is still valuable, but it is somewhat lacking in\r\nhardiness. Ohio is a favorite variety for evaporating. Of the\r\npurple-cap varieties, Shaffer and Columbian generally succeed. Among\r\nthe red varieties none are more universally successful than Cuthbert.\r\nKing is a promising early variety, and Loudon is a valuable late kind.\r\nMany growers find Marlboro and Turner well worthy of cultivation,\r\nalthough rather local in their adaptations; while for home use, Golden\r\nQueen, a yellow Cuthbert, is much liked.\r\n\r\nStrawberry.—Every one may grow strawberries, yet the saying that\r\nstrawberries will grow on any soil is misleading, although true. Some\r\nvarieties of strawberries will grow on certain soils better than other\r\nvarieties. What these varieties are can be determined only by an actual\r\ntest, but it is a safe rule to choose such varieties as prove good in\r\nmany localities.\r\n\r\nAs to the methods of culture, so much depends on the size of the plot,\r\nthe purpose for which the fruit is wanted, and the extent of care one\r\nis willing to give, that no set rule can be given for a garden in which\r\nbut few plants are grown and extra care can be given. The grower must\r\nalways be sure that his varieties will “fertilize”; that is, that he\r\nhas sufficient pollen-bearing kinds to insure a crop.\r\n\r\nWith the highest culture, good results can be obtained from the hill\r\nsystem of growing strawberries. For this the plants may be set in rows\r\n3 feet apart and 1 foot in the row, or if it be worked both ways, they\r\nmay be from 2 to 2-1/2 feet each way. In the small garden, where a\r\nhorse cannot be used, the plants are frequently set 1 foot each way,\r\narranging them in beds of three to five rows, with walks 2 feet wide\r\nbetween them. As fast as runners form, they should be removed, so that\r\nthe entire vigor of the plant will be exerted in strengthening the\r\ncrown. When extra fine specimen berries are desired, the plant may be\r\nheld above the ground by a wire frame, as shown in Fig. 288.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 288. Strawberry plant supported by a wire rack.]\r\n\r\nOr strawberries may be grown by the narrow matted-row system, in which\r\nthe runners, before rooting, should be turned along the rows at a\r\ndistance of 4 to 6 inches from the parent plant. These runners should\r\nbe the first ones made by the plant and should not be allowed to root\r\nthemselves, but “set in.” This is not a difficult operation; and if the\r\nrunners are separated from the parent plant as soon as they become well\r\nestablished, the drain on that plant is not great. All other runners\r\nshould be cut off as they start. The row should be about 12 inches wide\r\nat fruiting time (Fig. 289). Each plant should have sufficient feeding\r\nground, full sunlight, and a firm hold in the soil. This matted-row\r\nsystem is perhaps as good a method, either in a private garden or field\r\nculture, as could be practiced. With a little care in hoeing, weeding,\r\nand cutting off runners, the beds seem to produce as large crops the\r\nsecond year as the first.\r\n\r\nThe old way of growing a crop was to set the plants 10 to 12 inches\r\napart, in rows 3 feet apart, and allow them to run and root at will,\r\nthe results being a mass of small, crowded plants, each striving to\r\nobtain plant-food and none of them succeeding in getting enough. The\r\nlast, or outside runners, having but the tips of their roots in the\r\nground, are moved by the wind, heaved by the frost, or have the exposed\r\nroots dried out by the wind and sun.\r\n\r\nGround rich in potash produces the firmest and best flavored berries.\r\nExcessive use of stable manure, usually rich in nitrogen, should be\r\navoided, as tending to make too rank growth of foliage and berries of a\r\nsoft texture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 289. A narrow matted row of strawberries.]\r\n\r\nFor most purposes, strawberries should be set as early in the spring as\r\nthe ground can be worked. The planting can be done with a trowel,\r\nspade, or dibble, taking care to spread the roots out as much as\r\npossible and to press the soil firmly about them, holding the plant so\r\nthat the bud will be just above the surface. If the season is late and\r\nthe weather is hot and dry, some or all of the older leaves should be\r\nremoved. If water is used, it should be poured about the roots before\r\nthe hole is filled and as soon as it has soaked away the remaining soil\r\nshould be packed about the plants. During the first season the blossom\r\nstalks should be removed as soon as they appear, and the runners should\r\nbe restricted to a space about 1 foot wide. Some persons prefer still\r\nfurther to reduce the number of plants, and after layering from three\r\nto four plants between those originally set, to remove all others.\r\n\r\nStrawberries are often set in August or September, but this is\r\nadvisable only for small patches or when the soil is in the best\r\npossible condition and the highest culture is given. For garden\r\nculture, it may pay to secure potted plants (Fig. 290). These are sold\r\nby many nurserymen, and they may be obtained by plunging pots beneath\r\nthe runners as soon as the fruiting season is passed. In August, the\r\nplant should fill the pot (which should be 3-inch or 4-inch) and the\r\nplant is ready for setting in the plantation. Such plants should bear a\r\ngood crop the following spring.\r\n\r\nDuring the first season strawberries should be frequently worked,\r\nrather deep at first, but as the weather becomes warm and the roots\r\nfill the ground, tillage should be restricted to a depth of not more\r\nthan 2 inches. The weeds should never be allowed to get a start, and if\r\nthe season is dry, cultivation should be so frequent that the surface\r\nsoil should at all times be loose and open, forming a dust mulch to\r\nconserve the moisture. If the fall is moist and the plantation free\r\nfrom weeds, there will be little occasion for cultivation after the\r\nfirst of September, until just before the ground freezes up, when a\r\nthorough cultivation should be given. In addition to the horse\r\ncultivation, the hoe should be used whenever necessary to loosen the\r\nsoil about the plants and to destroy weeds that may start in the row.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 290. A potted strawberry plant.]\r\n\r\nAfter the ground has frozen, it will be advisable to mulch the plants\r\nby covering the space between the rows with some waste material to the\r\ndepth of about 2 inches. Directly over the plants a covering of 1 inch\r\nwill generally suffice. The material used should be free from the seeds\r\nof grass and weeds, and should be such as will remain upon the beds\r\nwithout blowing off and that will not pack down too closely upon the\r\nplants. Marsh hay makes an ideal mulch, but where it cannot be secured,\r\nstraw will answer. Corn fodder makes a clean but rather coarse mulch,\r\nand where they can be held in place by some other material, forest\r\nleaves do well as a mulch between the rows. In the spring the straw\r\nshould be removed from over the plants and allowed to remain between\r\nthe rows as a mulch, or all of it may be removed and the soil worked\r\nwith a cultivator.\r\n\r\nA large crop should be produced the second season; many persons think\r\nit best to renew the plantation each year, but if the plants are\r\nhealthy and the ground free from grass and weeds, the plantation can\r\noften be retained for a second crop. It will be well to plow the soil\r\naway from the rows so as to leave but a narrow strip, and along this\r\nthe old plants should be cut out so as to leave the new plants about 1\r\nfoot apart. If this is done in July, the rows should fill up by winter,\r\nso as to be in about the same condition as a new bed.\r\n\r\n_Insects and diseases of the strawberry_.\r\n\r\nThe insect most commonly troublesome to the strawberry grower is the\r\ncommon June-bug, or May-beetle, the larvae of which are often very\r\ncommon in land that has been in sod. Two years should elapse before sod\r\nland is used for this crop.\r\n\r\nCut-worms are often troublesome, but plowing the land the fall previous\r\nto setting the plants will destroy many of them. They can be poisoned\r\nby sprinkling about the field clover or other green plants that have\r\nbeen soaked in Paris green water (p. 203).\r\n\r\nThe most common fungous disease of the strawberry is leaf-blight or\r\n“rust,” which frequently causes much injury to the foliage, and may\r\nresult in the loss of the crop. Varieties least subject to the disease\r\nshould be chosen for planting, and on suitable soils and well cared\r\nfor, there need be little loss from this disease if the plantation is\r\nfrequently renewed. The rust and mildew may be held in check by\r\nbordeaux mixture. It is usually sufficient to spray after the blooming\r\nseason (or at any time the first year the plants are set), in order to\r\nsecure healthy foliage for the next year (p. 213).\r\n\r\n_Varieties of strawberries_.\r\n\r\nFor most parts of the country, Haverland, Warfield, Bubach, and Gandy\r\nafford a succession and are all hardy and productive varieties. The\r\nfirst three are imperfect-flowered varieties, and some such\r\nperfect-flowering kinds as Lowett or Bederwood should be provided to\r\nfertilize them. Among other varieties that do well in most sections are\r\nBrandywine, Greenville, Clyde, and Woolverton. Parker Earle is very\r\nlate, and is valuable for either home use or market, upon strong, moist\r\nsoils, where it can have the best of care. Belt (William Belt) and\r\nMarshall have large, showy fruits, and do well on strong soil.\r\n\r\nExcelsior or Michel might be added as very early; Aroma is grown very\r\nextensively in some sections; also Tennessee (Tennessee Prolific) is a\r\nvery promising new sort from Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nTHE GROWING OF THE VEGETABLE PLANTS\r\n\r\nA vegetable garden is admittedly a part of any home place that has a\r\ngood rear area. A purchased vegetable is never the same as one taken\r\nfrom a man’s own soil and representing his own effort and solicitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 291. Cultivating the backache.]\r\n\r\nIt is essential to any satisfaction in vegetable-growing that the soil\r\nbe rich and thoroughly subdued and fined. The plantation should also be\r\nso arranged that the tilling can be done with wheel tools, and, where\r\nthe space will allow it, with horse tools. The old-time garden bed\r\n(Fig. 291) consumes time and labor, wastes moisture, and is more\r\ntrouble and expense than it is worth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 292. Tracy’s plan for a kitchen-garden.]\r\n\r\nThe rows of vegetables should be as long and continuous as possible, to\r\nallow of tillage with wheel tools. If it is not desired to grow a full\r\nrow of any one vegetable, the line may be made up of several species,\r\none following the other, care being taken to place together such kinds\r\nas have similar requirements; one long row, for example, might contain\r\nall the parsnips, carrots, and salsify. One or two long rows containing\r\na dozen kinds of vegetables are usually preferable to a dozen short\r\nrows, each with one kind of vegetable.\r\n\r\nIt is well to place the permanent vegetables, as rhubarb and asparagus,\r\nat one side, where they will not interfere with the plowing or tilling.\r\nThe annual vegetables should be grown on different parts of the area in\r\nsucceeding years, thus practicing something like a rotation of crops.\r\nIf radish or cabbage maggots or club-root become thoroughly established\r\nin the plantation, omit for a year or more the vegetables on which they\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 293. A garden fence arranged to allow of horse\r\nwork.]\r\n\r\nA suggestive arrangement for a kitchen-garden is given in Fig. 292. In\r\nFig. 293 is a plan of a fenced garden, in which gates are provided at\r\nthe ends to allow the turning of a horse and cultivator (Webb Donnell,\r\nin _American Gardening_). Figure 294 shows a garden with continuous\r\nrows, but with two breaks running across the area, dividing the\r\nplantation into blocks. The area is surrounded with a windbreak, and\r\nthe frames and permanent plants are at one side.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means necessary that the vegetable-garden contain only\r\nkitchen-garden products. Flowers may be dropped in here and there\r\nwherever a vacant corner occurs or a plant dies. Such informal and\r\nmixed gardens usually have a personal character that adds greatly to\r\ntheir interest, and, therefore, to their value. One is generally\r\nimpressed with this informal character of the home-gardens in many\r\nEuropean countries, a type of planting that arises from the necessity\r\nof making the most of every inch of land. It was the writer’s pleasure\r\nto look over the fence of a Bavarian peasant’s garden and to see, on a\r\nspace about 40 feet by 100 feet in area, a delightful medley of onions,\r\npole beans, peonies, celery, balsams, gooseberries, coleus, cabbages,\r\nsunflowers, beets, poppies, cucumbers, morning-glories, kohl-rabi,\r\nverbenas, bush beans, pinks, stocks, currants, wormwood, parsley,\r\ncarrots, kale, perennial phlox, nasturtiums, feverfew, lettuce, lilies!\r\n\r\n_Vegetables for six_ (by C.E. Hunn).\r\n\r\nA home vegetable-garden for a family of six would require, exclusive of\r\npotatoes, a space not over 100 by 150 feet. Beginning at one side of\r\nthe garden and running the rows the short way (having each row 100 feet\r\nlong) sowings may be made, as soon as the ground is in condition to\r\nwork, of the following:\r\n\r\nFifty feet each of parsnips and salsify.\r\n\r\nOne hundred feet of onions, 25 feet of which may be potato or set\r\nonions, the remainder black-seed for summer and fall use.\r\n\r\nFifty feet of early beets; 50 feet of lettuce, with which radish may be\r\nsown to break the soil and be harvested before the lettuce needs the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nOne hundred feet of early cabbage, the plants for which should be from\r\na frame or purchased. Set the plants 18 inches to 2 feet apart.\r\n\r\nOne hundred feet of early cauliflower; culture same as for cabbage.\r\n\r\nFour hundred and fifty feet of peas, sown as follows:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 294. A family kitchen-garden.]\r\n\r\n100 feet of extra early.\r\n100 feet of extra early, sown late.\r\n100 feet of intermediate.\r\n100 feet of late.\r\n50 feet of dwarf varieties.\r\n\r\nIf trellis or brush is not to be used, frequent sowings of the dwarfs\r\nwill maintain a supply.\r\n\r\nAfter the soil has become warm and all danger of frost has passed, the\r\ntender vegetables be planted as follows:\r\n\r\nCorn in five rows 3 feet apart, three rows to be early and intermediate\r\nand two rows late.\r\n\r\nOne hundred feet of string beans, early to late varieties.\r\n\r\nVines as follows:—\r\n\r\n10 hills of cucumbers, 6x6 feet.\r\n6 hills of early squash, 6x6 feet.\r\n20 hills of muskmelon, 6x6 feet.\r\n10 hills of Hubbard, 6x6 feet.\r\n\r\nOne hundred feet of okra.\r\n\r\nTwenty eggplants. One hundred feet (25 plants) tomatoes.\r\n\r\nSix large clumps of rhubarb.\r\n\r\nAn asparagus bed 25 feet long and 3 feet wide.\r\n\r\nLate cabbage, cauliflower, and celery are to occupy the space made\r\nVacant by removing early crops of early and intermediate peas and\r\nstring beans.\r\n\r\nA border on one side or end will hold all herbs, such as parsley,\r\nthyme, sage, hyssop, mints.\r\n\r\n_The classes of vegetables_.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to grow particular vegetables, it will help the\r\nbeginner to an understanding of the subject if he recognizes certain\r\ncultural groups or classes, and what their main requirements are.\r\n\r\nRoot-crops—Beet, carrot, parsnip, salsify.\r\n\r\nThe root-crops are cool-weather plants; that is, they may be sown very\r\nearly, even before light frosts disappear; and the winter kinds grow\r\nvery late in the fall, or may be left in the ground till most other\r\ncrops are harvested. They are not often transplanted.\r\n\r\nLoose and deep soil, free from clods, is required to grow straight and\r\nwell-developed roots. The land must also be perfectly drained, not only\r\nto remove superfluous moisture, but to provide a deep and friable soil.\r\nSubsoiling is useful in hard lands. A large admixture of sand is\r\ngenerally desirable, provided the soil is not likely to overheat in\r\nsunny weather.\r\n\r\nTo keep roots fresh in the cellar, pack them in barrels, boxes, or bins\r\nof sand which is just naturally moist, allowing each root to come\r\nwholly or partly in contact with the sand. The best material in which\r\nto pack them is sphagnum moss, the same that nurserymen use in packing\r\ntrees for shipment, and which may be obtained in bogs in many parts of\r\nthe country. In either sand or sphagnum, the roots will not shrivel;\r\nbut if the cellar is warm, they may start to grow. Roots can also be\r\nburied, after the manner of potatoes.\r\n\r\nAlliaceous group—Onion, leek, garlic.\r\n\r\nA group of very hardy cool-weather plants, demanding unusually careful\r\npreparation of the surface soil to receive the seeds and to set the\r\nyoung plants going. They withstand frost and cool weather, and may be\r\nsown very early. Seeds are sown directly where the plants are to stand.\r\nFor early onions, however, the special practice has recently arisen of\r\ntransplanting from seedbeds.\r\n\r\nBrassicaceous group—Cabbage, kale, cauliflower.\r\n\r\nThese are cool-weather crops, all of them withstanding considerable\r\nfrost. The cabbages and kales are often started in fall in the middle\r\nand southern latitudes, and are harvested before hot weather arrives.\r\n\r\nIn the northern states, these plants will all do best when started\r\nearly in hotbed, frame, or greenhouse,—from the last of February to\r\nApril—and transplanted to the open ground May first to June first,\r\npartly because their season of growth may be long and partly to enable\r\nthem to escape the heat of midsummer. Still, some persons are\r\nsuccessful in growing late cabbage, kale, and cauliflower, by sowing\r\nthe seeds in hills and in the open ground where the plants are to\r\nmature. It is best to transplant the young plantlets twice, first from\r\nthe seed-bed to boxes, or frames, about the time the second set of true\r\nleaves appears, placing the plants 24 inches apart each way, and\r\ntransplanting again to the open ground in rows 4 to 5 feet apart, with\r\nplants 2 to 4 feet apart in the row. If the plants are started under\r\ncover, they should be hardened off by exposure to light and air during\r\nthe warmer hours of several days preceding the final transplanting.\r\n\r\nThe most serious enemy of cabbage-like plants is the root-maggot. See\r\ndiscussion of this insect on pp. 187, 201.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 295. The white butterfly that lays the eggs for the\r\ncabbage-worm.]\r\n\r\nThe cabbage-worm (larva of the white butterfly shown in Fig. 295) can\r\nbe dispatched with pyrethrum or kerosene emulsion. It must be treated\r\nvery early, before the worm gets far into the head (p. 200).\r\n\r\nThe club-root or stump-root is a fungous disease for which there is no\r\ngood remedy. Use new land if the disease is present (p. 208).\r\n\r\nSolanaceous group—Tomato, egg-plant, red pepper.\r\n\r\nThese are warm-weather plants, very impatient of frost. They are all\r\nnatives of southern zones, and have not yet become so far acclimatized\r\nin the North as not to need the benefit of our longest seasons.\r\n\r\nPlants should be started early, under glass. They should be “pricked\r\noff,” when the second leaves appear, 3 or 4 inches apart, into flats or\r\nboxes. These boxes should be kept in a coldframe, to which an abundance\r\nof light and air is admitted on warm, sunny days, in order to harden\r\nthem off. After all danger of frost is past, and the garden soil is\r\nwell warmed, the plants may be finally transplanted.\r\n\r\nIf the ground is too rich, these plants are likely to grow too late in\r\nthe northern seasons.\r\n\r\nCucurbitaceous group—Cucumber, melon, squash, pumpkin.\r\n\r\nAll the members of this group are very tender to frost, and they must\r\nnot be planted till the season is thoroughly open and settled. The\r\nplants are not transplanted, unless they are transferred from boxes or\r\npots.\r\n\r\nSeeds must be planted somewhat shallow from early spring to midsummer.\r\nFor the earliest cucumbers and melons, seeds are planted in frames.\r\nThat is, each hill is inclosed by a portable box frame about 3 feet\r\nsquare and usually having a movable sash cover. The cover is raised or\r\nremoved in warm days, and the frame bodily taken away when all danger\r\nof frost is past. In field culture, seeds are planted an inch deep,\r\nfour to six in a hill, with hills 4 by 6 feet apart, these distances\r\nbeing varied slightly, according to location and variety. Good\r\ncucumbers are sometimes grown in hills surrounding a barrel in which\r\nmanure is placed to be leached out by successive waterings.\r\n\r\nThe omnipresent enemies of all the cucurbitaceous crops are the little\r\ncucumber beetle and the large black “stink bug.” Ashes, lime, or\r\ntobacco dust occasionally seem to show some efficiency in preventing\r\nthe ravages of these insects, but the only reasonably sure immunity is\r\nin the use of covers over the hills (Fig. 229) and in hand-picking (p.\r\n202). Covers may also be made by stretching mosquito netting over arcs\r\nof barrel hoops or bent wires. If by some such means the plants are\r\nkept insect-free till they outgrow the protection, they will usually\r\nescape serious damage from insects thereafter. It is well to plant trap\r\nor decoy hills of cucumbers, squashes, or melons in advance of the\r\nregular planting, on which the bugs may be harvested.\r\n\r\nLeguminous crops—Peas and beans.\r\n\r\nTwo cultural groups are included in the legumes,—the bean group\r\n(including all field, garden, and kidney beans, and the cowpea)\r\ncomprising warm-weather plants; the pea group (including field and\r\ngarden pea, the Windsor or Broad bean) comprising cool-weather plants.\r\nThe former are quickly susceptible to frost and should be planted only\r\nafter the weather is settled. The latter are among the earliest\r\nvegetables to be planted. The leguminous crops are not transplanted,\r\nthe seed being placed where the plants are to grow.\r\n\r\nSalad plants and pot-herbs (“greens”).\r\n\r\nThese plants are all grown for their, tender, fresh, succulent leaves,\r\nand therefore every reasonable effort should be made to secure quick\r\nand continuous foliage growth. It is manifestly expedient that they be\r\ngrown in warm, mellow ground, well cultivated and copiously watered.\r\nSuch small plants as cress, corn salad, and parsley may be grown in\r\nsmall beds, or even in boxes or pots; but in a garden where space is\r\nnot too scant, they may be more conveniently managed in rows, like peas\r\nor beets. Nearly all the salad plants may be sown in the spring, and\r\nfrom time to time throughout the summer for succession. The group is\r\nculturally not homogeneous, inasmuch as some of the plants need special\r\ntreatment; but most of them are cool-weather subjects.\r\n\r\nSweet-herbs.\r\n\r\nThe herb garden should find a place on all amateurs’ grounds.\r\nSweet-herbs may sometimes be made profitable by disposing of the\r\nsurplus to the green grocer and the druggist. The latter will often buy\r\nall that the housewife wishes to dispose of, as the general supply of\r\nmedicinal herbs is grown by specialists, and goes into the hands of the\r\nwholesaler and is often old when received by the local dealer.\r\n\r\nThe seedsmen’s catalogues mention upwards of forty different herbs,\r\nmedicinal and culinary. The majority of them are perennial, and will\r\ngrow for many years if well taken care of. However, it is better to\r\nresow them every three or four years. Beds 4 feet square of each of the\r\nherbs will supply an ordinary family.\r\n\r\nThe perennial sweet-herbs may be propagated by division, although they\r\nare usually grown from seeds. The second year—and sometimes even the\r\nfirst year—the plants are strong enough for cutting. The common\r\nperennial sweet-herbs are: Sage, lavender, peppermint, spearmint,\r\nhyssop, thyme, marjoram, balm, catnip, rosemary, horehound, fennel,\r\nlovage, winter savory, tansy, wormwood, costmary.\r\n\r\nThe commoner annual species (or those that are treated as annuals) are:\r\nAnise, sweet basil, summer savory, coriander, pennyroyal, caraway\r\n(biennial), clary (biennial), dill (biennial), sweet marjoram\r\n(biennial).\r\n\r\n_The culture of the leading vegetables_.\r\n\r\nHaving now obtained a view of the layout of the vegetable-garden and a\r\ngood conception of the leading cultural groups, we may proceed with a\r\ndiscussion of the different kinds of vegetables themselves. Good\r\nexperience is better than book advice; but the person who consults a\r\nbook is the one who lacks experience. Any printed directions are\r\nnecessarily imperfect, and they may not be adaptable to the particular\r\nconditions under which the amateur works; but they ought to set him in\r\nthe right direction so that he may more easily find his way. Seedsmen’s\r\ncatalogues often contain much useful and reliable advice of this kind.\r\n\r\nAsparagus.—The best of all early spring vegetables; a hardy herbaceous\r\nperennial, grown for the soft edible shoots that spring from the crown.\r\n\r\nThe culture of asparagus has been simplified in the past few years, and\r\nat present the knowledge required successfully to plant and grow a good\r\nsupply need not be that of a professional. The old method of excavating\r\nto the depth of 3 feet or more, throwing in from 4 to 6 inches of\r\nbroken stone or bricks for drainage, then filling to within 16 to 18\r\ninches of the surface with well-rotted manure, with 6 inches of soil\r\nupon which to set the roots, has given place to the simple practice of\r\nplowing or digging a trench from 14 to 16 inches deep, spreading\r\nwell-rotted manure in the bottom to the depth of 3 or 4 inches; when\r\nwell trodden down covering the manure with 3 or 4 inches of good garden\r\nsoil, then setting the plants, with the roots well spread out, covering\r\ncarefully with soil to the level of the garden, and firming the soil\r\nwith the feet. This will leave the crowns of the plants from 4 to 5\r\ninches below the surface.\r\n\r\nIn stubborn, heavy soil the best method to pursue in making a permanent\r\nbed is to throw out all the dirt from the trench and replace with good,\r\nfibrous loam.\r\n\r\nIn setting, 1-year-old plants will prove more satisfactory than older\r\nones, being less liable to suffer from injury to the root system than\r\nthose that have made a larger growth. Two years after setting the crop\r\nmay be cut somewhat, but not sooner if a lasting bed is desired, as the\r\neffort to replace the stalks has a tendency to weaken the plant unless\r\nthe roots are well established. The cutting should cease in June or\r\nearly July, or the roots may be much weakened. In cutting, care should\r\nbe taken to insert the knife vertically, so that adjoining crowns will\r\nnot be injured (Fig. 296).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 296. Good _A_ and poor _B_ modes of inserting the\r\nknife to cut asparagus. Some careful growers pull or break the shoots\r\nrather than cut them.]\r\n\r\nThe yearly treatment of an asparagus bed consists of cleaning off tops\r\nand weeds in the fall and adding a dressing of well-rotted manure to\r\nthe depth of 3 or 4 inches, this manure to be lightly forked into the\r\nbed the following spring; or the tops may be allowed to stand for\r\nwinter protection and the mulch left off. A top-dressing of nitrate of\r\nsoda, at the rate of 200 pounds per acre, is often beneficial as a\r\nspring stimulant, particularly in the case of an old bed. Good results\r\nwill also follow an application of bone meal or superphosphate at the\r\nrate of some 300 to 500 pounds per acre. The practice of sowing salt on\r\nan asparagus bed is almost universal; yet beds that have never received\r\na pound of salt are found to be as productive as those having received\r\nan annual dressing. Nevertheless, a salt dressing is recommended. Two\r\nrows of asparagus 25 feet long and 3 feet apart should supply a large\r\nfamily with an abundance throughout the season, and if well taken care\r\nof, will last a number of years.\r\n\r\nConover Colossal is the variety most generally grown, and is perhaps\r\nthe most satisfactory sort. Palmetto, a variety originating at the\r\nSouth, is also very popular.\r\n\r\nArtichoke.—The artichoke of literature is a tall, coarse perennial of\r\nthe thistle tribe, producing edible flower-heads. Cardoon is a related\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe fleshy scales of the head and the soft “bottom” of the head are the\r\nparts used. The young suckers or shoots may also be tied together and\r\nblanched, using them like asparagus or Swiss chard. But few of these\r\nplants would be needed for a family, as they produce a number of\r\nflower-heads to a plant and a quantity of suckers. The plants should be\r\nset from 2 to 3 feet apart in the row, the rows being 3 feet apart.\r\nThis vegetable is not quite hardy in the North, but a covering of\r\nleaves or barnyard litter to the depth of a foot will protect it well.\r\nThe plant is perennial, but the best yield comes from young plants. If\r\nthe heads are allowed to ripen, they reduce the vitality of the plant.\r\n\r\nArtichokes have never become so popular in this country as to have\r\nproduced a long list of varieties. Large Green Globe is most commonly\r\noffered by seedsmen. Edible heads should be secured the second year\r\nfrom seed. Seedlings are likely to vary greatly, and if one is fond of\r\nartichokes, he would do better to propagate by suckers from the best\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThese plants make no mean decorative subjects, either massed or in a\r\nmixed border, and from the rarity of their culture are always objects\r\nof interest.\r\n\r\nArtichoke, Jerusalem, is a wholly different plant from the above,\r\nalthough it is commonly known as “artichoke” in this country. It is a\r\nspecies of sunflower that produces potato-like tubers. These tubers may\r\nbe used in lieu of potatoes. They are very palatable to hogs; and when\r\nthe plant becomes a weed,—as it often does,—it may be exterminated by\r\nturning the hogs into the field. Hardy, and will grow anywhere.\r\n\r\nBean.—Every garden grows beans of one kind or another. Under this\r\ngeneral name, many kinds of plants are cultivated. They are all tender,\r\nand the seeds, therefore, should not be planted until the weather is\r\nthoroughly settled; and the soil should be warm and loose. They are all\r\nannuals in northern countries, or treated as such.\r\n\r\nThe bean plants may be classified in various ways. In respect to\r\nstature, they may be thrown into three general categories; viz. the\r\npole or climbing beans, the bush beans, and the strict-growing or\r\nupright beans (as the Broad or Windsor bean).\r\n\r\nIn respect to their uses, beans again may be divided into three\r\ncategories; viz. those used as string or snap beans, the entire pod\r\nbeing eaten; those that are used as shell beans, the full-size but\r\nimmature beans being shelled from the pod and cooked; dry beans, or\r\nthose eaten in their dry or winter condition. The same variety of bean\r\nmay be used for all of these three purposes at different stages of its\r\ndevelopment; but as a matter of fact, there are varieties better for\r\none purpose than the other.\r\n\r\nAgain, beans may be classified in respect to their species. Those\r\nspecies that are best known are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Common bean, or _Phaseolus vulgaris_, of which there are both tall\r\nand bush forms. All the common snap and string beans belong here, as\r\nalso the Speckled Cranberry types of pole beans, and the common field\r\nbeans.\r\n\r\n(2) The Lima beans, or _Phaseolus lunatus_. The larger part of these\r\nare pole beans, but lately dwarf or bush varieties have appeared.\r\n\r\n(3) The Scarlet Runner, _Phaseolus multiflorus_, of which the Scarlet\r\nRunner and White Dutch Runner are familiar examples. The Scarlet Runner\r\nis usually grown as an ornamental vine, and it is perennial in warm\r\ncountries, but the seeds are edible as shelled beans. The White Dutch\r\nRunner is oftener cultivated for food.\r\n\r\n(4) The Yard-Long, or Asparagus bean, _Dolichos sesquipedalis_, which\r\nproduces long and weak vines and very long, slender pods. The green\r\npods are eaten, and also the shelled beans. The French Yard-Long is the\r\nonly variety of this type that is commonly known in this country. This\r\ntype of bean is popular in the Orient.\r\n\r\n(5) The Broad beans, of which the Windsor is the common type. These are\r\nmuch grown in the Old World for stock feed, and they are sometimes used\r\nfor human food. They grow to one strict, central, stiff stalk, to a\r\nheight of 2 to 4 or 5 feet, and they are very unlike other kinds of\r\nbeans in appearance. In this country, they are very little grown on\r\naccount of our hot and dry summers. In Canada they are somewhat raised,\r\nand are sometimes used in the making of silage.\r\n\r\n(6) The cowpea, which is really a bean (species of _Vigna_), much grown\r\nin the South for hay and green-manuring, is also a very good table\r\nvegetable and one that is destined to increase in popularity for\r\ndomestic use.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the bean, while of the easiest, often proves a failure\r\nas far as the first crop is concerned, from planting the seed before\r\nthe ground has become warm and dry. No vegetable seed will decay\r\nquicker than beans, and the delay caused by waiting for the soil to\r\nbecome warm and free from excessive moisture will be more than made up\r\nby the rapidity of growth when finally they are planted. Beans will\r\ngrow on most any land, but the best results may be secured by having\r\nthe soil well enriched and in good physical condition.\r\n\r\nFrom the 5th to the 10th of May in the latitude of central New York, it\r\nwill be safe to plant beans for an early crop. The beans may be dropped\r\n2 inches deep in shallow drills, the seeds to lie 3 inches apart. Cover\r\nto the surface of the soil, and if the ground be dry, firm it with the\r\nfoot or the back of the hoe. For the bush varieties, allow 2 feet\r\nbetween the drill-rows, but for the dwarf Limas 2-1/2 feet is better.\r\nPole Limas are usually planted in hills 2 to 3 feet apart in the rows.\r\nDwarf Limas may be sown thinly in drills.\r\n\r\nA large number of the varieties of both the green-podded and the\r\nwax-podded beans are used almost exclusively as snap beans, to be eaten\r\nwith the pod while tender. The various strains of the Black Wax are the\r\nmost popular string beans. The pole or running beans are used either\r\ngreen or dried, and the Limas, both tall and dwarf, are well known for\r\ntheir superior flavor either as shelled or dry beans. The old-fashioned\r\nCranberry or Horticultural Lima type (a pole form of _Phaseolus\r\nvulgaris_) is probably the best shell bean, but the trouble of poling\r\nmakes it unpopular. Dwarf Limas are much more desirable for small\r\ngardens than the pole varieties, as they may be planted much closer,\r\nthe bother of procuring poles or twine is avoided, and the garden will\r\nhave a more sightly appearance. Both the dwarf Limas and pole Limas\r\nrequire a longer season in which to mature than the bush beans, and\r\nonly one planting is usually made.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary bush beans may be planted at intervals of two weeks from\r\nthe first planting until the 10th of August. Each planting may be made\r\non ground previously occupied by some early-maturing crop. Thus, the\r\nfirst to third plantings may be on ground from which has been harvested\r\na crop of spinach, early radish, or lettuce; after that, on ground\r\nwhere early peas have been grown; and the later sowings where beets or\r\nearly potatoes have grown. String beans for canning are usually taken\r\nfrom the last crop.\r\n\r\nOne quart of seed will plant 100 feet of drill of the bush beans; or 1\r\nquart of Limas will plant 100 hills.\r\n\r\nLimas are the richest of beans, but they often fail to mature in the\r\nnorthern states. The land should not be very strong in nitrogen (or\r\nstable manure), else the plants will run too much to vine and be too\r\nlate. Choose a fertile sandy or gravelly soil with warm exposure, use\r\nsome soluble commercial fertilizer to start them off, and give them the\r\nbest of culture. Aim to have the pods set before the droughts of\r\nmidsummer come. Good trellises for beans are made by wool twine\r\nstretched between two horizontal wires, one of which is drawn a foot\r\nabove the ground and the other 6 or 7 feet high.\r\n\r\nBean plants are not troubled by insects to any extent, but they are\r\nsometimes attacked by blight. When this occurs, do not plant the same\r\nground to beans again for a year or two.\r\n\r\nBeet.—This vegetable is grown for its thick root, and for its herbage\r\n(used as “greens”); and ornamental-leaved varieties are sometimes\r\nplanted in flower-gardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 297. Bastian turnip beet.]\r\n\r\nBeing one of the hardiest of spring vegetables, the seed may be sown as\r\nearly in the spring as the ground can be worked. A light, sandy soil is\r\nthe best on which to grow beets to perfection, but any well-tilled\r\ngarden land will raise satisfactory crops. On heavy ground the turnip\r\nbeet gives the best results, as the growth is nearly all at or above\r\nthe surface. The long varieties, having tapering roots running deep\r\ninto the soil, are liable to be misshapen unless the physical condition\r\nof the soil is such that the roots meet with little obstruction. A\r\nsuccession of sowings should be made, at intervals of two to three\r\nweeks, until late summer, as the beets are much more desirable in their\r\nyoung stage than when they have become old and woody. The mangel-wurzel\r\nand the sugar-beet are usually grown as a field crop, and will not\r\nenter into the calculations of the home garden.\r\n\r\nIn order to hasten the season of the extra-early crop of beets, the\r\nseeds may be sown in boxes or in the soil of a hotbed in February or\r\nMarch, transplanting the small plants to the open ground at the time\r\nthe first sowing of seed is made. As the flat or turnip-rooted\r\nvarieties grow at the surface of the ground, the seed may be sown\r\nthickly, and as the more advanced roots are large enough to use they\r\nmay be pulled, leaving room for the later ones to develop, thus growing\r\na large quantity in a small area and having a long season of small\r\nbeets from one sowing.\r\n\r\nFor winter use the late July-sown seed will give the best roots,\r\ngrowing through the cool months of the fall to a medium size and\r\nremaining firm without being tough or stringy. These may be dug after\r\nlight frosts and before any severe cold weather, and stored in barrels\r\nor boxes in the cellar, using enough dry dirt to fill spaces between\r\nthe roots and cover them to the depth of 6 inches. These roots, thus\r\npacked in a cool cellar, will be fit to use through the entire winter\r\nmonths. When it can be had, florists’ or sphagnum moss is an excellent\r\nmedium in which to pack roots for winter.\r\n\r\nThe early round or turnip varieties (Fig. 297) are best for early and\r\nsummer use. The long blood beets may be used for storing, but these\r\nrequire a longer season of growth.\r\n\r\nBroccoli—is almost identical with the cauliflower, except that it\r\nusually requires a longer season and matures in the fall. It is grown\r\nmore generally in Europe than in this country. The special merit of\r\nbroccoli is its adaptability for late summer planting and its rapid\r\ngrowth in the late season. It is said that a large proportion of\r\nbroccoli is used in the manufacture of pickles. The culture is the same\r\nas for cauliflower,—deep, moist soil well enriched, cool weather, and\r\nthe destruction of the cabbage worm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 298. Brussels sprouts.]\r\n\r\nBrussels sprouts.—The plant is grown for the buttons or sprouts\r\n(miniature cabbage heads) that grow thickly along the stem (Fig. 298).\r\nIt should be more generally known, as it is one of the choicest of the\r\ncabbage family, and may be had at its best after the season for\r\ncauliflower has passed. It is the better for being touched by the fall\r\nfrosts. The buttons should be cut off rather than broken. The very\r\nsmall hard “sprouts” or buttons are the best. The culture is\r\nessentially the same as for late cabbage or broccoli. One ounce will\r\nsow 100 feet of drill, or make upward of 2000 plants. Set plants in\r\nfield 2 to 3 feet apart, or dwarf varieties closer. They require the\r\nentire season in which to grow.\r\n\r\nCabbage.—The cabbage is now so extensively grown as a field crop, from\r\nwhich the market is supplied, and the plants require so much room that\r\nmany home-gardeners incline to give up its culture; but the early\r\nvarieties, at least, should be grown at home.\r\n\r\nFor an early crop in the North, the plants must be started either in\r\nFebruary or early March, or the previous September and wintered over in\r\ncoldframes. This latter method was once a common practice by gardeners\r\nnear large cities, but the building of greenhouses to replace the many\r\nhotbeds of the market-gardener has changed the practice in many\r\nlocalities, and now most of the early cabbages in the North are grown\r\nfrom seed sown in January, February, or March. The plants are hardened\r\noff in March and early April and planted out as early as possible. The\r\nprivate grower, or one with a small garden, may often procure his early\r\nplants from the market-gardener much cheaper than he can grow them, as\r\nusually only a limited number of early cabbage plants are wanted; but\r\nfor the midseason and main crop, the seed may be sown in May or June in\r\na seed-bed, setting the plants in July.\r\n\r\nThe seed-bed should be made mellow and rich. A good border will do. The\r\nseed is sown preferably in rows, thus allowing thinning of the plants\r\nand the pulling of any weeds that germinate. The young plants will well\r\nrepay attention to watering and thinning. The rows should be 3 or 4\r\ninches apart. When the plants are large enough to transplant, they may\r\nbe planted where early vegetables have been grown. Set the plants from\r\n18 to 24 inches apart in the row, the rows being 3 feet apart for the\r\nmedium-growing kinds. One ounce of seed will furnish about 2000 plants.\r\n\r\nAll cabbages require deep and rich soil, and one that holds moisture\r\nwell. Regular cultivation should be given so that moisture may be saved\r\nand the growth be continuous.\r\n\r\nFor early planting, the number of varieties is limited to three or\r\nfour. For an intermediate crop the list is more extended, and the late\r\nvarieties are very numerous. The early list is headed by the Jersey\r\nWakefield, a variety that heads very quickly, and, although not one of\r\nthe solid kinds, is generally grown. The Early York and Winnigstadt are\r\ngood varieties to follow it. The latter especially is solid and of very\r\ngood quality. For the midseason, the Succession and All Season are of\r\nthe best, and for the winter supply the Drumhead, Danish Ball, and Flat\r\nDutch types are leaders. One of the best of the cabbages for table use\r\nis seldom seen in the garden—the Savoy cabbage. It is a type with\r\nnetted leaves, making a large, low-growing head, the center of which is\r\nvery solid and of excellent flavor, especially late in the fall, when\r\nthe heads have had a slight touch of frost. Savoy should be grown in\r\nevery private garden.\r\n\r\nThe best remedy for the cabbage worm is to kill the first brood on the\r\nvery young plants with Paris green. After the plants begin to head,\r\npyrethrum, kerosene emulsion, or salt water may be used. On a small\r\narea, hand-picking may be recommended (p. 200).\r\n\r\nThe maggot is the most serious cabbage pest. After studying the seventy\r\nodd remedies proposed, Slingerland concludes that six are efficient and\r\npracticable: growing the young plants in closely covered frames; tarred\r\npaper cards placed snugly about the base of the plants to keep the fly\r\naway; rubbing the eggs from the base of the plant; hand-picking of the\r\nmaggots; treating the plants with emulsion of carbolic acid; treating\r\nthem with carbon bisulfide. The insecticidal materials are injected or\r\npoured into the soil about the base of the plant (pp. 187, 201).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 299. A method of storing cabbages.]\r\n\r\nThe club-root, which causes the roots to become greatly thickened and\r\ndistorted, is difficult to manage if cabbages or allied plants are\r\ngrown continuously on land in which diseased plants have been raised.\r\nChanging the location of the cabbage or cauliflower patch is the best\r\nprocedure. If very different crops, as corn, potatoes, peas, tomatoes,\r\nare grown on the land, the disease will be starved out in two or three\r\nyears (p. 208).\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of storing cabbages for winter and spring use, none\r\nof which are uniformly successful. The general subject is discussed on\r\np. 158. On this point T. Greiner writes as follows: “I have heretofore\r\npiled a lot of cabbages cut from the stump in a conical heap in the\r\nfield, and covered them with clusters of the outer leaves cut off with\r\na piece of the stump. The leaves are carefully placed over the heap in\r\nshingle fashion, so as to shed water. Cabbages thus piled and covered\r\nmay be left out until real winter weather sets in. But I find that\r\nslugs and earthworms frequently infest the cabbages thus stored, and do\r\na good deal of damage. It might be well to place a solid floor of lime\r\nor salt upon the ground, and then pack the cabbages upon this. If to be\r\nleft out after severe freezing has set in, one should put additional\r\ncovering, such as straw, corn-stalks or marsh hay, over the whole\r\nheap.” Mr. Burpee’s little book, ‘Cabbage and Cauliflower for Profit,’\r\nwritten by J.M. Lupton, a prominent cabbage-grower, suggests the\r\nfollowing plan for early winter sales: “Take the cabbages up with the\r\nroots on, and store in well-ventilated cellars, where they will keep\r\ntill mid-winter. Or stack them in some sheltered position about the\r\nbarn, placing one above the other in tiers, with the roots inside, and\r\ncovering deeply with seaweed; or if this cannot be obtained, something\r\nlike cornstalks may be used to keep them from the weather as much as\r\npossible (Fig. 299). When thus stored, they may be obtained any time\r\nduring the winter when prices are favorable.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 300. A half-long carrot.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCarrot.—While essentially a farm crop in this country, the carrot is\r\nnevertheless a most acceptable garden vegetable. It is hardy and easily\r\ngrown. The extra-early varieties may be forced in a hotbed, or seed may\r\nbe sown as soon as the ground is fit to work in the spring. The\r\nstump-rooted, or half-long varieties (Fig. 300), are sown for the\r\ngeneral garden crop.\r\n\r\nWell-enriched, mellow loam, deeply dug or plowed, is best suited to the\r\nrequirements of carrots. The seed for the main crop may be sown as late\r\nas July 1. Sow thickly, thinning to 3 to 4 inches in the row. The rows,\r\nif in a garden that is hand-worked, may be 12 inches apart. If the\r\ncultivation is performed with a horse, the rows should be from 2 to 3\r\nfeet apart. One ounce will sow 100 feet of drill.\r\n\r\nCauliflower.—This is the choicest of all vegetables of the cabbage\r\ngroup, and its culture is much the most difficult. While the special\r\nrequirements are few, they must be fully met if good results are to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe general culture of cauliflower is much like that of cabbage, except\r\nthat the cauliflower, being more tender, should be more thoroughly\r\nhardened off before setting out, the heads must be protected from hot\r\nsuns, the plants must never suffer for moisture, and the greatest care\r\nmust be taken to secure only highly bred seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 301. Cauliflower head with leaves trimmed off.]\r\n\r\nIt is essential that the plants be set out as early as possible, as the\r\nwarm weather of June causes them to make imperfect heads unless the\r\nsoil is filled with moisture. No garden crop will so well repay the\r\ncost and time of thorough irrigation, either by running the water\r\nbetween the rows or applying it directly to the plants. When it is\r\nimpossible to furnish water and there is danger of losing the soil\r\nmoisture, it is a good plan to mulch heavily with straw or some other\r\nsubstance. This mulch, if put on just after a heavy rain, will hold the\r\nmoisture for a long time. Cauliflower prospers best in a cool climate.\r\n\r\nWhen the heads begin to form, the outside leaves may be brought\r\ntogether and tied above the head, excluding the direct sunshine and\r\nkeeping the head white and tender. Fig. 301 shows a good head.\r\n\r\nNo vegetable will respond more quickly to good culture and well-manured\r\nsoil than the cauliflower, and none will prove such an utter failure\r\nwhen neglected. It is imperative that care be taken to destroy all the\r\ncabbage worms before the leaves are tied in, as after that it will be\r\nimpossible to see or reach them. From 1000 to 1500 plants may be grown\r\nfrom 1 ounce of seed. Good cauliflower seed is very expensive.\r\n\r\nFor winter crop, seeds may be started in June or July, as for late\r\ncabbage.\r\n\r\nErfurt, Snowball, and Paris are popular early varieties. Nonpareil and\r\nAlgiers are good late kinds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 302. Celeriac or turnip-rooted celery.] Celeriac.—A\r\nform of the celery plant in which the tuberous root is the edible part\r\n(Fig. 302). The tuber has the celery flavor in a pronounced degree, and\r\nis used for flavoring soups and for celery salad. It may be served raw,\r\nsliced in vinegar and oil, or boiled.\r\n\r\nThe culture is the same as given for celery, except that no earthing or\r\nblanching is required. About an equal number of plants are obtained\r\nfrom the same weight of seed as from celery seed. Celeriac is\r\nextensively used abroad, but, unfortunately, little known in America.\r\n\r\nCelery.—Although celery has now become a staple vegetable with all\r\nclasses of people, the home-gardener is likely not to attempt its\r\nculture; yet it is not difficult to raise in small quantities in most\r\nany good garden land. While the commercial celery is largely grown on\r\nreclaimed swamp lands, such areas are not at all essential to its\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThe self-blanching varieties have simplified the culture of celery so\r\nthat the amateur, as well as the expert, may have a good supply at\r\nleast six months of the year. The so-called new culture, which consists\r\nof setting the plants close together and causing them to shade each\r\nother, can be recommended for the garden when a supply of well-rotted\r\nmanure is to had, and when any amount of water is available. This\r\nmethod is as follows: Fork or spade into the soil a large quantity of\r\nmanure to the depth of 10 to 12 inches; pulverize the soil until the\r\nground for the depth of 4 to 6 inches is in very fine condition. Then\r\nset the plants in rows 10 inches apart and the plants but 5 or 6 inches\r\napart in the rows. It will be seen that plants set as close as this\r\nwill soon fill the soil with a mass of roots and must have large\r\namounts of plant-food, as well as a large quantity of water; and the\r\nmaking of such a bed can be recommended only to those who can supply\r\nthese needs.\r\n\r\nThe common practice in home gardens is to plow or dig a shallow trench,\r\nsetting the plants in the bottom and hoeing in the soil as the plants\r\ngrow. The distance apart of the rows and plants will depend on the\r\nvarieties. For the dwarf varieties, such as White Plume, Golden\r\nSelf-blanching, and others of this type, the rows may be as close as 3\r\nfeet and the plants 6 inches in the rows. For the large-growing\r\nvarieties, as Kalamazoo, Giant Pascal, and, in fact, most of the late\r\nvarieties, the rows may be 4 1/2 to 5 feet apart and the plants 7 or 8\r\ninches in the row.\r\n\r\nThe seed for an early crop should be sown in February or early in March\r\nin shallow boxes, which may be placed in a hotbed or sunny window, or\r\nsown directly in the soil of a hotbed. Cover the seeds thinly and press\r\nthe soil firmly over them. When the seedling plants are about 1 inch\r\nhigh, they should be transplanted to other boxes or hotbeds, setting\r\nthe plants 1 inch apart in rows 3 inches apart. At this transplanting,\r\nas with the following ones, the tall leaves should be cut or pinched\r\noff, leaving only the upright growth, as with the utmost care it is\r\nalmost impossible to prevent the outside leafstalks from wilting down\r\nand dying. The roots should also be trimmed back at each transplanting\r\nin order to increase the feeding roots. The plants should be set as\r\ndeep as possible, care being taken, however, not to allow the heart of\r\nthe plant to be covered up. The varieties usually grown for an early\r\ncrop are the so-called self-blanching varieties. They may be made fit\r\nfor the table with much less labor than the late crop, the shade\r\nrequired to blanch the stalks being much less. When only a few short\r\nrows are grown in a private garden, screens of lath may be made by\r\ndriving stakes on each side of the row and tacking lath on, leaving\r\nspaces of an inch or more for the light to enter; or each head may be\r\nwrapped in paper, or a tile drain pipe may be set over the plant. In\r\nfact, any material that will exclude the light will render the stalks\r\nwhite and brittle.\r\n\r\nThe seed for the main or fall crop should be sown in April or early May\r\nin a seed-bed prepared by forking short well-rotted manure into a fine\r\nsoil, sowing the seed thinly in rows 8 or 10 inches apart, covering the\r\nseed lightly and firming over the seed with the feet, hoe, or back of a\r\nspade. This seed-bed should be kept moist at all times until the seed\r\ngerminates, either by close attention to watering or by a lath screen.\r\nThe use of a piece of cloth laid directly on the soil, and the bed wet\r\nthrough the cloth, is often recommended, and if the cloth is always wet\r\nand taken off the bed as soon as the seed sprouts, it may be used.\r\nAfter the young plants have grown to the height of 1 or 2 inches they\r\nmust be thinned out, leaving the plants so that they do not touch each\r\nother, and transplanting those thinned—if wanted—to other ground\r\nprepared in the same manner as the seed-bed. All these plants may be\r\nsheared or cut back to induce stockiness.\r\n\r\nAn ounce of seed will furnish about three thousand plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 303. Storing celery in a trench in the field.]\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 304. A celery pit.]\r\n\r\nIf in a private garden, the ground on which the fall crop is usually\r\nset will likely be that from which a crop of some early vegetable has\r\nbeen taken. This land should be again well enriched with fine,\r\nwell-rotted manure, to which may be added a liberal quantity of wood\r\nashes. If the manure or ashes is not easily obtained, a small amount\r\nmay be used by plowing or digging out a furrow 8 or 12 inches deep,\r\nscattering the manure and ashes in the bottom of the trench and filling\r\nit up almost level with the surface. The plants should be set about the\r\nmiddle of July, preferably just before a rain. The plant bed should\r\nhave a thorough soaking shortly before the plants are lifted, and each\r\nplant be trimmed, both top and root, before setting. The plants should\r\nbe set from 5 to 6 inches apart in the rows and the earth well firmed\r\naround each one.\r\n\r\nThe after-cultivation consists in thorough tillage until the time of\r\n“handling” or earthing up the plants. This process of handling is\r\naccomplished by drawing up the earth with one hand while holding the\r\nplant with the other, packing the soil well around the stalks. This\r\nprocess may be continued until only the leaves are to be seen. For the\r\nprivate grower, it is much easier to blanch the celery with boards or\r\npaper, or if the celery is not wanted until winter, the plants may be\r\ndug up, packed closely in boxes, covering the roots with soil, and\r\nplaced in a dark, cool cellar, where the stalks will blanch themselves.\r\nIn this way celery may be stored in boxes in the house cellar. Put\r\nearth in the bottom of a deep box, and plant the celery in it.\r\n\r\nCelery is sometimes stored in trenches in the open (Fig. 303), the\r\nroots being transplanted to such places in late fall. The plants are\r\nset close together and the trenches are covered with boards. A wider\r\ntrench or pit may be made (Fig. 304) and covered with a shed roof.\r\n\r\nChard, or Swiss chard,—is a development of the beet species\r\ncharacterized by large succulent leafstalks instead of enlarged roots.\r\n(Fig. 305). The leaves are very tender and make “greens” much like\r\nyoung beets. They are cultivated exactly like beets. Only one variety\r\nis offered by most seedsmen in this country, though in France and\r\nGermany several varieties are grown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 305. Swiss chard.]\r\n\r\nChicory is grown for two purposes,—for the roots and for the herbage.\r\n“Barbe de capucin” is a salad made from young shoots of chicory.\r\n\r\nThe Magdeburg chicory is the variety usually spoken of, it being the\r\none most extensively grown. The roots of this, after being ground and\r\nroasted, are used either as a substitute or an adulterant for coffee.\r\n\r\nThe Witloof, a form of chicory, is used as a salad, or boiled and\r\nserved in the same manner as cauliflower. The plants should be thinned\r\nto 6 inches. In the latter part of summer they should be banked up like\r\ncelery, and the leaves used after becoming white and tender. This and\r\nthe common wild chicory are often dug in the fall, the leaves cut off,\r\nthe roots packed in sand in a cellar and watered until a new growth of\r\nleaves starts. These leaves grow rapidly and are very tender, making a\r\nfine salad vegetable. One packet of seed of the Witloof will furnish\r\nplants enough for a large family.\r\n\r\nChervil.—The chervil is grown in two forms,—for the leaves, and for the\r\ntuberous roots.\r\n\r\nThe curled chervil is a good addition to the list of garnishing and\r\nseasoning vegetables. Sow seeds and cultivate the same as parsley.\r\n\r\nThe tuberous chervil resembles a short carrot or parnsip. It is much\r\nesteemed in France and Germany. The tubers have somewhat the flavor of\r\na sweet potato, perhaps a little sweeter. They are perfectly hardy,\r\nand, like the parsnip, the better for frosts. The seed may be sown in\r\nSeptember or October, as it does not keep well; or as soon as the\r\nground is fit to work in the spring, it being slow to germinate after\r\nthe weather becomes hot and dry. One packet of seed will give all the\r\nplants necessary for a family.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. Golden bantam sweet corn. XXIV. Golden bantam sweet corn.\r\n\r\nCollards.—This is a name given to a kind of kale, used when young as\r\ngreens; also to young cabbages used in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe seed of any early cabbage may be sown thickly in rows 18 inches\r\napart, from early spring to late fall. The plants are cut off when 6 or\r\n8 inches high and boiled as are other greens.\r\n\r\nThe kale, or Georgia collards, is grown in the South, where cabbages\r\nfail to head. It grows to the height of 2 to 6 feet, furnishing a large\r\nquantity of leaves. The young leaves and tufts that arise as the old\r\nleaves are pulled off make excellent greens.\r\n\r\nCives.—A small perennial of the onion family, used for flavoring.\r\n\r\nIt is propagated by division of the root. It may be planted in a\r\npermanent place in the border, and, being completely hardy, will remain\r\nfor years. The leaves are the parts used, as the roots are very rank in\r\nflavor. The leaves may be cut frequently, as they readily grow again.\r\n\r\nCorn salad.—This is one of the earliest spring salad vegetables, coming\r\ninto condition with spinach, and needing the same culture.\r\n\r\nSown in the fall, and covered with straw or hay when cold weather sets\r\nin, it will start into rapid growth when the covering is removed in\r\nMarch or April. Or the seed may be sown in early spring, and plants\r\nwill be fit to use in six or eight weeks. One packet of seed will\r\nsuffice for a small family.\r\n\r\nCorn, sweet or sugar.—This is the characteristic American table\r\nvegetable, and one that every home-gardener expects to grow. Too often,\r\nhowever, only one planting of one kind is made. The ears come to edible\r\nmaturity almost simultaneously, and a short season is the result.\r\n\r\nThe first planting of sweet corn should be made from May 1 to 10,\r\nplanting early, intermediate, and late varieties at the same time, then\r\nat intervals of two weeks until the middle of July, when the late\r\nvarieties should be planted, thus having a succession from the first\r\ncrop until October.\r\n\r\nThe soil for corn should be fertile and “quick.” The coarser manure\r\nleft from the preparation of the ground for small crops may be used to\r\ngood advantage. Corn for the garden is better planted in drills, the\r\ndrills 3 feet apart, dropping the seed from 10 to 12 inches apart in\r\nthe drills. One quart of seed will plant 200 hills.\r\n\r\nFor extra early, Marblehead, Adams, Vermont, Minnesota, and Early Corey\r\nare favorites. A most excellent extra early yellow sweet corn, with\r\nkernels looking like small field corn, is Golden Bantam; the ears are\r\nsmall and would probably not attract the market buyer, but for home use\r\nthe variety is unexcelled (Plate XXIV). For later crop, Crosby, Hickox,\r\nShoe Peg, and Stowell Evergreen are now popular.\r\n\r\nCress.—Two very unlike species of plants are grown under the name of\r\ncress,—the upland-cress and the water-cress. There are still other\r\nspecies, but not much known in this country.\r\n\r\nThe upland cress, or the true pepper grass, may be grown on any garden\r\nsoil. Sow early in the spring. It makes a rapid growth and can be cut\r\nin from four to five weeks. Succession of sowings must be made, as it\r\nruns quickly to seed. The curled variety is the one usually grown, as\r\nthe leaves may be used for garnishing as well as for salads. One packet\r\nof seed will be sufficient for each sowing. Any good soil will do. Sow\r\nthickly in drills 12 to 18 inches apart. In summer it runs to seed\r\nquickly, so that it is usually grown in spring and fall.\r\n\r\nThe water-cress is more exacting in its culture, and can be\r\nsuccessfully grown only in moist places, such as edges of shallow\r\nslow-running creeks, open drains, or beds excavated near such streams.\r\nA few plants for private use may be grown in a frame, provided a\r\nretentive soil is used and attention given to watering the bed often.\r\nWatercress may be propagated from pieces of the stem, used as cuttings.\r\nIf one is fond of water-cress, it is well to colonize it in some clean\r\ncreek or pool. It will take care of itself year by year. Seeds may also\r\nbe used for propagating it.\r\n\r\nCucumber.—The custom of putting down cucumber pickles in the home\r\nkitchen is probably passing out; but both the pickling and the slicing\r\ncucumbers, especially the latter, are still an essential part of a good\r\nhome garden. A stale or wilted cucumber is a very poor article of food.\r\n\r\nFor early use, the cucumber is usually started in a hotbed or coldframe\r\nby sowing the seed on pieces of sod 4 to 6 inches square, turned grass\r\nside down. Three or four seeds are placed on or pushed into each piece\r\nof sod and covered with 1 to 2 inches of fine soil. The soil should be\r\nwell watered and the glass or cloth placed over the frame. The roots\r\nwill run through the sod. When the plants are large enough to set out,\r\na flat trowel or a shingle may be slipped under the sod and the plants\r\nmoved to the hill without check. In place of sod, old quart berry-boxes\r\nare good; after setting in the hill the roots may force their way\r\nthrough the cracks in the baskets. The baskets also decay rapidly.\r\nFlower-pots may be used. These plants from the frames may be set out\r\nwhen danger of frost is over, usually by the 10th of May, and should\r\nmake a very rapid growth, yielding good-sized fruits in two months. The\r\nhills should be made rich by forking in a quantity of well-rotted\r\nmanure, and given a slight elevation above the garden—not high enough\r\nto allow the wind to dry the soil, but slightly raised so that water\r\nwill not stand around the roots.\r\n\r\nThe main crop is grown from seed planted directly in the open, and the\r\nplants are grown under level culture.\r\n\r\nOne ounce of seed will plant fifty hills of cucumbers. The hills may be\r\n4 to 5 feet apart each way.\r\n\r\nThe White Spine is the leading general-purpose variety. For very early\r\nor pickling sorts, the Chicago, Russian, and other picklings are good.\r\n\r\nThe striped beetle is an inveterate pest on cucumbers and squashes (see\r\npage 201).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 306. West Indian gherkin (_Cucumis Anguria_).]\r\n\r\nThe name gherkin is applied to small pickling cucumbers. The West India\r\ngherkin is a wholly distinct species, but is grown like cucumbers.\r\n(Fig. 306.)\r\n\r\nDandelion.—Under domestication the dandelion has been developed until\r\nquite unrecognizable to the casual observer. The plants attain a large\r\nsize and the leaves are much more tender.\r\n\r\nSow in spring in well-manured soil, either in drills or in hills 1 foot\r\napart. A cutting of leaves may be had in September or October, and some\r\nof the stools may stand until spring. The delicacy of the leaves may be\r\nimproved by blanching them, either by the use of boards or earth. One\r\ntrade packet of seed will supply a sufficient number for a family. The\r\nwhole plant is destroyed when the crop of leaves is taken.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be selected from the best field-grown plants, but it is\r\nbetter to buy the French seed of the seedsmen.\r\n\r\nEgg-plant.—The egg-plant or guinea squash has never become a popular\r\nhome-garden product in the North. In the South it is better known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 307. Black Pekin egg-plant.]\r\n\r\nUnless one has a greenhouse or a very warm hotbed, the growing of\r\negg-plants in the North should be left to the professional gardener, as\r\nthe young plants are very tender, and should be grown without a check.\r\nThe seed should be sown in the hotbed or the greenhouse about April 10,\r\nkeeping a temperature of 65° to 70°. When the seedlings have made three\r\nrough leaves, they may be pricked out into shallow boxes, or, still\r\nbetter, into 3-inch pots. The pots or boxes should be plunged to the\r\nrim in soil in a hotbed or coldframe so situated that protection may be\r\ngiven on chilly nights. The 10th of June is early enough to plant them\r\nout in central New York.\r\n\r\nThe soil in which egg-plants are to grow cannot well be made too\r\n“quick,” as they have only a short season in which to develop their\r\nfruits. The plants are usually set 3 feet apart each way. A dozen\r\nplants are sufficient for the needs of a large family, as each plant\r\nshould yield from two to six large fruits. The fruits are fit to eat at\r\nall stages of growth, from those the size of a large egg to their\r\nlargest development. One ounce of seed will furnish 600 to 800 plants.\r\n\r\nThe New York Improved Purple is the standard variety. Black Pekin (Fig.\r\n307) is good. For early, or for a short-season climate, the Early Dwarf\r\nPurple is excellent.\r\n\r\nEndive.—One of the best fall salad vegetables, being far superior to\r\nlettuce at that time and as easily grown.\r\n\r\nFor fall use, the seed may be sown from June to August, and as the\r\nplants become fit to eat about the same time from sowing as lettuce\r\ndoes, a succession may be had until cold weather. The plants will need\r\nprotection from the severe fall frosts, and this may be given by\r\ncarefully lifting the plants and transplanting to a frame, where sash\r\nor cloth may be used to cover them in freezing weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 308. Endive tied up.]\r\n\r\nThe leaves, which constitute practically the whole plant, are blanched\r\nbefore being used, either by tying together with some soft material\r\n(Fig. 308) or by standing boards on each side of the row, allowing the\r\ntop of the boards to meet over the center of the row. Tie the leaves\r\nonly when they are dry.\r\n\r\nThe rows should be 1-1/2 or 2 feet apart, the plants 1 foot apart in\r\nthe rows. One ounce of seed will sow 150 feet of drill.\r\n\r\nGarlic.—An onion-like plant, the bulbs of which are used for flavoring.\r\n\r\nGarlic is little known in this country except amongst those of foreign\r\nbirth. It is multiplied the same as multiplier onions—the bulb is\r\nbroken apart and each bulbule or “clove” makes a new compound bulb in a\r\nfew weeks. Hardy; plant in early spring, or in the South in the fall.\r\nPlant 2 to 3 inches apart in the row.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 309. A good horseradish root.]\r\n\r\nHorseradish.—Widely used as an appetizer, and now grown commercially.\r\nAs a kitchen-garden vegetable, this is usually planted in some\r\nout-of-the-way spot and a piece of the root dug as often as needed, the\r\nfragments of roots being left in the soil to grow for further use. This\r\nmethod results in having nothing but tough, stringy roots, very unlike\r\nthe product of a properly planted and well-cared-for bed. A good\r\nhorseradish root should be straight and shapely (Fig. 309).\r\n\r\nThe best horseradish is secured from sets planted in the spring at the\r\ntime of setting early cabbage, and dug as late the same fall as the\r\nweather will permit. It becomes, therefore, an annual crop. The roots\r\nfor planting are small pieces, from 4 to 6 inches long, obtained when\r\ntrimming the roots dug in the fall. These pieces may be packed in sand\r\nand stored until wanted the following spring.\r\n\r\nIn planting, the roots should be set with the upper end 3 inches below\r\nthe surface of the ground, using a dibber or sharp-pointed stick in\r\nmaking the holes. The crop may be planted between rows of early-sown\r\nbeets, lettuce, or other crop, and given full possession of the ground\r\nwhen these crops are harvested. When the ground is inclined to be stiff\r\nor the subsoil is near the surface, the roots may be set in a slanting\r\nposition. In fact, many gardeners practice this method of planting,\r\nthinking that the roots make a better growth and are more uniform in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nKale.—Under this name, a great variety of cabbage-tribe plants is\r\ngrown, some of them reaching a height of several feet. Usually,\r\nhowever, the name is applied to a low-growing, spreading plant,\r\nextensively used for winter and spring greens.\r\n\r\nThe culture given to late cabbage is suitable. At the approach of\r\nsevere freezing weather a slight protection is given in the North. The\r\nleaves remain green through the winter and may be gathered from under\r\nthe snow at a time when material for greens is scarce. Some of the\r\nkales are very ornamental because of their blue and purple curled\r\nfoliage. The Scotch Curled is the most popular variety. Let the plants\r\nstand 18 to 30 inches apart. Young cabbage plants are sometimes used as\r\nkale. Collards and borecole are kinds of kale. Sea-kale is a wholly\r\ndifferent vegetable (which see).\r\n\r\nKales are extensively grown at Norfolk, Va., and southward, and shipped\r\nNorth in winter, the plants being started in late summer or in fall.\r\n\r\nKohlrabi is little known in the United States. It looks like a leafy\r\nturnip growing above ground.\r\n\r\nIf used when small (2 to 3 inches in diameter), and not allowed to\r\nbecome hard and tough, it is of superior quality. It should be more\r\ngenerally grown. The culture is very simple. A succession of sowings\r\nshould be made from early spring until the middle of summer, in drills\r\n18 inches to 2 feet apart, thinning the young plants to 6 or 8 inches\r\nin the rows. It matures as quickly as turnips. One ounce of seed to 100\r\nfeet of drill.\r\n\r\nLeek.—The leek is little grown in this country except by persons of\r\nforeign extraction. The plant is one of the onion family, and is used\r\nmostly as flavoring for soups. Well-grown leeks have a very agreeable\r\nand not very strong onion flavor.\r\n\r\nLeek is of the easiest culture, and is usually grown as a second crop,\r\nto follow beets, early peas, and other early stuff. The seed should be\r\nsown in a seed-bed in April or early May and the seedlings planted out\r\nin the garden in July, in rows 2 feet apart, the plants being 6 inches\r\napart in the rows. The plants should be set deep if the neck or lower\r\npart of the leaves is to be used in a blanched condition. The soil may\r\nbe drawn towards the plants in hoeing, to further the blanching. Being\r\nvery hardy, the plants may be dug in late fall, and stored the same as\r\ncelery, in trenches or in a cool root-cellar. One ounce of seed to 100\r\nfeet of drill.\r\n\r\nLettuce is the most extensively grown salad vegetable. It is now in\r\ndemand, and is procurable, every month in the year. The winter and\r\nearly spring crops are grown in forcing-houses and coldframes, but a\r\nsupply from the garden may be had from April to November, by the use of\r\na cheap frame in which to grow the first and last crops, relying on a\r\nsuccession of sowings for the intermediate supply.\r\n\r\nSeed for the first crop may be sown in a coldframe in March, growing\r\nthe crop thick and having many plants which are small and tender; or,\r\nby thinning out to the distance of 3 inches and allowing the plants to\r\nmake a larger growth, the plants pulled up may be set in the open\r\nground for the next crop.\r\n\r\nSowings should be made in the garden from April to October, at short\r\nintervals. A moist location should be chosen for the July and August\r\nsowings. The early and late sowings should be of some loose-growing\r\nvariety, as they are in edible condition sooner than the cabbage or\r\nheading varieties.\r\n\r\nThe cabbage varieties are far superior to the loose-growing kinds for\r\nsalads. To be grown to perfection, they should have very rich soil,\r\nfrequent cultivation, and an occasional stimulant, such as liquid\r\nmanure or nitrate of soda.\r\n\r\nThe cos lettuce is an upright-growing type much esteemed in Europe, but\r\nless grown here. The leaves of the full-grown plants are tied together,\r\nthus blanching the center, making it a desirable salad or garnishing\r\nvariety. It thrives best in summer.\r\n\r\nOne ounce of seed will grow 3000 plants or sow 100 feet of drill. In\r\nthe garden, plants may stand 6 inches apart in the rows, and the rows\r\nmay be as close together as the system of tillage will allow.\r\n\r\nMushroom.—Sooner or later, the novice wants to grow mushrooms. While it\r\nis easy to describe the conditions under which they may be grown, it\r\ndoes not follow that a crop may be predicted with any certainty.\r\n\r\nLatterly, careful studies have been made of the growing of mushrooms\r\nfrom spores and of the principles involved in the making of spawn, with\r\nthe hope of reducing the whole subject of mushroom growing to a\r\nrational basis. A good idea of this work may be had by reading Duggar’s\r\ncontribution on the subject in Bulletin 85 of the Bureau of Plant\r\nIndustry, United States Department of Agriculture. In this place,\r\nhowever, we may confine ourselves to the customary horticultural\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraphs are from “Farmers’ Bulletin,” No. 53 (by\r\nWilliam Falconer), of the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture (March, 1897):—\r\n\r\nMushrooms are a winter crop, coming in from September till April or\r\nMay—that is, the work of preparing the manure begins in September and\r\nends in February, and the packing of the crop begins in October or\r\nNovember and ends in May. Under extraordinary conditions the season may\r\nbegin earlier and last longer, and, in fact, it may continue all\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nMushrooms can be grown almost anywhere out of doors, and also indoors\r\nwhere there is a dry bottom in which to set the beds, where a uniform\r\nand moderate temperature can be maintained, and where the beds can be\r\nprotected from wet overhead, and from winds, drought, and direct\r\nsunshine. Among the most desirable places in which to grow mushrooms\r\nare barns, cellars, closed tunnels, sheds, pits, greenhouses, and\r\nregular mushroom houses. Total darkness is not imperative, for\r\nmushrooms grow well in open light if shaded from sunshine. The\r\ntemperature and moisture are more apt to be equable in dark places than\r\nin open, light ones, and it is largely for this reason that mushroom\r\nhouses are kept dark.\r\n\r\nThe best fertilizer for mushrooms, so far as the writer’s experience\r\ngoes, is fresh horse manure. Get together a lot of this material (short\r\nand strawy) that has been well trampled and wetted in the stable. Throw\r\nit into a heap, wet it well if it is at all dry, and let it heat. When\r\nit begins to steam, turn it over, shake it well so as to mix thoroughly\r\nand evenly, and then tramp it down solid. After this let it stand till\r\nit again gets quite warm; then turn, shake, trample as before, and add\r\nwater freely if it is getting dry. Repeat this turning, moistening, and\r\ntrampling as often as it is needful to keep the manure from “burning.”\r\nIf it gets intensely hot, spread it out to cool, after which again\r\nthrow it together. After being turned in this way several times, and\r\nthe heat in it is not apt to rise above 130° F., it should be ready to\r\nmake up in the beds. By adding to the manure at the second or third\r\nturning one-fourth or one-fifth of its bulk of loam, the tendency to\r\nintense heating is lessened and its usefulness not at all impaired.\r\nSome growers prefer short manure exclusively, that is, the horse\r\ndroppings, while others like a good deal of straw mixed in with this.\r\nThe writer’s experience, however, is that, if properly prepared, it\r\nmatters little which is used.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the beds are only 8 to 10 inches deep; that is, they are\r\nfaced with 10-inch-wide hemlock boards, and are only the depth of this\r\nboard. In such beds put a layer of fresh, moist, hot manure, and\r\ntrample it down firm until it constitutes half the depth of the bed;\r\nthen fill up with the prepared manure, which should be rather cool\r\n(100° to 115°F.) when used, and pack all firmly. If desired, the beds\r\ncan be made up entirely of the prepared manure. Shelf beds are usually\r\n9 inches deep; that is, the shelf is bottomed with 1-inch boards and\r\nfaced with 10-inch wide boards. This allows about 8 inches for manure,\r\nand 1 inch rising to 2 inches of loam on top. In filling the shelf beds\r\nthe bottom half may be of fresh, moist or wettish, hot manure, packed\r\ndown solid, and the top half of rather cool prepared manure, or it may\r\nbe made up of all prepared manure. As the shelf beds cannot be trodden\r\nand cannot be beaten very firm with the back of the fork, a brick is\r\nused in addition to the fork.\r\n\r\nThe beds should be spawned after the heat in them has fallen below 100°\r\nF. The writer considers 90° F. about the best temperature for spawning.\r\nIf the beds have been covered with hay, straw, litter, or mats, these\r\nshould be removed. Break each brick into twelve or fifteen pieces. The\r\nrows should be, say, 1 foot apart, the first one being 6 inches from\r\nthe edge, and the pieces should be 9 inches apart in the row.\r\nCommencing with the first row, lift up each piece, raise 2 to 3 inches\r\nof the manure with the hand, and into this hole place the piece,\r\ncovering over tightly with the manure. When the entire bed is spawned,\r\npack the surface all over. It is well to cover the beds again with\r\nstraw, hay, or mats, to keep the surface equally moist. The flake spawn\r\nis planted in the same way as the brick spawn, only not quite so deep.\r\n\r\nAt the end of eight or nine days the mulching should be removed and the\r\nbeds covered with a layer of good loam 2 inches thick, so that the\r\nmushrooms can come up in and through it. This gives them a firm hold,\r\nand to a large extent improves their quality and texture. Any fair loam\r\nwill do. That from an ordinary field, wayside, or garden is generally\r\nused, and it answers admirably. There exists an idea that garden soil\r\nsurfeited with old manure is unfit for mushroom beds because it is apt\r\nto produce spurious fungi. This, however, is not the case. In fact, it\r\nis the earth most commonly used. For molding the beds the loam should\r\nbe rather fine, free, and mellow, so that it can be easily and evenly\r\nspread and compacted firmly into the manure.\r\n\r\nIf an even atmospheric temperature of from 55° to 60° F. can be\r\nmaintained, and the house or cellar containing the mushroom beds is\r\nkept close and free from drafts, the beds may be left uncovered, and\r\nshould be watered if they become dry. But no matter where the beds are\r\nsituated, it is well to lay some loose hay or straw or some old matting\r\nor carpet over them to keep them moist. The covering, however, should\r\nbe removed just as soon as the young mushrooms begin to appear above\r\nground. If the atmosphere is dry, the pathways and walls should be\r\nsprinkled with water. The mulching should also be sprinkled, but not\r\nenough to cause the water to soak into the bed. However, if the bed\r\nshould get dry, do not hesitate to water it.\r\n\r\nMustard.—Almost all the mustards are good for greens, though white\r\nmustard is usually best. Chinese mustard is also valuable.\r\n\r\nSeed should be sown in drills, 3 to 3-1/2 feet apart, and covered with\r\na half inch of soil. The ease with which they may be grown, and the\r\nabundance of herbage which they yield, mark their special utility. Sow\r\nvery early for spring greens, and in late summer or early September for\r\nfall greens.\r\n\r\nMuskmelon.—The most delicious of all garden vegetables eaten from the\r\nhand, and of simple cultivation; but like many another plant that is\r\neasy to grow it often fails completely. The season and soil must be\r\nwarm and the growth continuous.\r\n\r\nThe natural soil for melons is a light, sandy loam, well enriched with\r\nrotted manure, although good crops may be grown on land naturally heavy\r\nif the hills are specially prepared. When only heavy soil is available,\r\nthe earth where the seeds are to be planted should be thoroughly\r\npulverized and mixed with fine, well-rotted manure. A sprinkling of\r\nleafmold or chip-dirt will help to lighten it. On this hill from ten to\r\nfifteen seeds may be sown, thinning to four or five vines when danger\r\nof insects is over.\r\n\r\nThe season may be advanced and the damage from insects lessened by\r\nstarting the plants in hotbeds. This may be done by using fresh sod,\r\ncut into 6-inch pieces, placing them grass-side down in the hotbed,\r\nsowing eight to ten seeds on each piece, and covering with 2 inches of\r\nlight soil. When all danger of frost is over, and the ground has become\r\nwarm, these sods may be carefully lifted and set in the prepared hills.\r\nThe plants usually grow without check, and fruit from two to four weeks\r\nahead of those from seed planted directly in the hill. Old quart\r\nberry-boxes are excellent to plant seeds in, as, when they are set in\r\nthe ground, they very quickly decay, causing no restriction to the\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nNetted Gem, Hackensack, Emerald Gem, Montreal, Osage, and the Nutmeg\r\nmelon are popular varieties. One ounce of seed will plant about fifty\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nOkra.—A plant of the cotton family, from the green pods of which is\r\nmade the well-known gumbo soup of the South, where the plant is more\r\nextensively grown than in the North. The pods are also used in their\r\ngreen state for stews, and are dried and used in winter, when they are\r\nnutritious, and form no little part of the diet in certain sections of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are very sensitive to cold and moisture, and should not be\r\nsown until the ground has become warm—the last week in May or the first\r\nof June being early enough in New York. The seed should be sown in a\r\ndrill 1 inch deep, the plants thinned to stand 12 inches in the row.\r\nGive the same culture as for corn. One ounce will sow 40 feet of drill.\r\nDwarf varieties are best for the North. Green Density and Velvet are\r\nleading varieties.\r\n\r\nOnion.—A few onions, of one kind or another, give character to every\r\ngood kitchen-garden. They are grown from seeds (“black seed”) for the\r\nmain crop. They are also grown from sets (which are very small onions,\r\narrested in their development); from “tops” (which are bulblets\r\nproduced in the place of flowers); and from multipliers or potato\r\nonions, which are compound bulbs.\r\n\r\nThe extremely early crop of onions is grown from sets, and the late or\r\nfall crop is grown from seed sown in April or early May. The sets may\r\nbe saved from the crop harvested the previous fall, saving no bulbs\r\nmeasuring over three-fourths of an inch in diameter, or, better, they\r\nmay be purchased from the seedsman. These sets should be planted as\r\nearly as possible in the spring, preferably on land that has been\r\nmanured and trenched in the fall. Plant in rows 12 inches apart, the\r\nsets being 2 or 3 inches in the row. Push the sets well down into the\r\nground and cover with soil, firming them with the feet or a roller. In\r\ncultivating, the soil should be thrown towards the tops, as the white\r\nstems are usually sought as an indication of mildness. The crop will be\r\nin condition to use in three to four weeks, and may be made to last\r\nuntil small seed onions are to be had. Tops or multipliers may also be\r\nused for the early crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 310. Bunch onions, grown from seed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn growing onions from seed, it is only necessary to say that the seed\r\nshould be in the ground very early in order that the bulbs make their\r\ngrowth before the extreme hot weather of August, when, for want of\r\nmoisture and because of the heat, the bulbs will ripen up while small.\r\nEarly in April, in New York, if the ground is in condition, the seed\r\nshould be sown thickly in drills from 12 to 16 inches apart, and the\r\nground above the seeds well firmed. Good cultivation and constant\r\nweeding is the price of a good crop of onions. In cultivating and\r\nhoeing, the soil should be kept away from the rows, not covering the\r\ngrowing bulbs, but allowing them to spread over the surface of the\r\nground. When the crop is ready to be harvested, the bulbs may be pulled\r\nor cultivated up, left to dry in double rows for several days, the tops\r\nand roots taken off, and the bulbs stored in a dry place. Later in the\r\nseason they may be allowed to freeze, covering with chaff or straw to\r\nhold them frozen, and kept until early spring; but this method is\r\nusually unsafe with beginners, and always so in a changeable climate.\r\nOnion seed should always be fresh when sown—preferably of the last\r\nyear’s crop. One ounce of onion seed will sow 100 feet of drill.\r\n\r\nOne of the recent methods of securing extra large and also early bulbs\r\nfrom seed is to sow the seed in a hotbed in February or early March,\r\nand transplant to the open ground in April. A bunch of onions, for\r\neating from hand, is shown in Fig. 310.\r\n\r\nThe Danvers, Prizetaker, Globe, and Wethersfield are favorite\r\nvarieties, with the addition of White Queen or Barletta for pickling.\r\n\r\nParsley.—This is the most universal of garnishes. It is used also as a\r\nflavoring in soups.\r\n\r\nThe seed is slow to germinate, and often the second or third sowing is\r\nmade, thinking the first is a failure; but usually after what would\r\nseem a long time the young plants will be seen. When sown in the open\r\nground, it should be thinned to stand 3 or 4 inches in the row, the\r\nrows being 10 to 12 inches apart. A few plants in a border will give a\r\nsupply for a large family, and with a little protection will live over\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nRoots may be lifted in the fall, put into boxes or old cans, and grown\r\nin a sunny window for winter use. The Curled parsley is the form\r\ncommonly used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 311. The Student parsnip, a leading variety]\r\n\r\nParsnip.—A standard winter and spring vegetable, of the easiest culture\r\nin deep soil (Fig. 311).\r\n\r\nParsnips are the better for the winter’s freeze, although they are of\r\ngood quality if taken up after the fall frosts and packed in soil,\r\nsand, or moss in the cellar.\r\n\r\nThe seed, which must be not over one year old, should be sown as early\r\nas possible in well-prepared soil, firmed with the feet or roller. As\r\nthe seed germinates rather slowly, the ground often becomes crusted or\r\nbaked over the seeds, in which case it should be broken and fined with\r\na garden rake. This operation often means the success of the crop.\r\nRadish or cabbage seeds may be sown with the parsnip seed to mark the\r\nrow and break the crust. One ounce of seed will sow 200 feet of drill.\r\nThin to 6 inches apart in the row.\r\n\r\nPea.—Perhaps no vegetable is planted in greater expectancy than the\r\npea. It is one of the earliest seeds to go into the ground, and the\r\nplanting fever is impatient.\r\n\r\nThere is great difference in quality between the smooth and the\r\nwrinkled peas. The first are a little the earliest to be planted and to\r\nbecome fit for use, and on that account should be planted in a small\r\nway; but the wrinkled sorts are much superior in quality.\r\n\r\nThe early crop of peas may be forwarded by sprouting the seeds indoors.\r\nSoil may be made too rich or strong for peas.\r\n\r\nFor the kitchen-garden the dwarf and half-dwarf varieties are the best,\r\nas the tall kinds will need brush or wire to support them, causing\r\nconsiderable trouble and labor and not being as neat in appearance. The\r\ndwarf varieties should be planted four rows in a block, each row being\r\nonly 6 or 8 inches apart. The peas on the two center rows may be picked\r\nfrom the outside. Leave a space of 2 feet and plant the same.\r\n\r\nThe tall varieties yield a larger crop than the dwarfs, but as the rows\r\nmust be made from 3 to 5 feet apart, the dwarf ones, which are planted\r\nonly 6 to 8 inches apart, will give as large a yield on the same area.\r\nAlways plant double rows of the tall varieties; that is, two rows from\r\n4 to 6 inches apart, with the brush or wire between, the double rows\r\nbeing from 3 to 5 feet apart, according to varieties.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the first planting only the smooth varieties should be\r\nsown, but by the middle of April in New York the ground will be warm\r\nand dry enough for wrinkled sorts. Succession crops should be sown that\r\nwill come to maturity one after the other, extending the season six or\r\neight weeks. If a further supply is wanted, the early quick-maturing\r\nvarieties may be sown in August, usually giving a fair crop of peas in\r\nSeptember and early October. In the hot weather of midsummer they do\r\nnot thrive so well. One quart of seed will plant about 100 feet of\r\ndrill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 312. One of the bell peppers.]\r\n\r\nPepper.—The garden pepper is not the pepper of commerce; it is more\r\nproperly known as red pepper (though the pods are not always red),\r\nchilli, and capsicum. The pods are much used in the South, and most\r\nNorthern households now employ them to some extent.\r\n\r\nPeppers are tender while young, although they will endure a heavy frost\r\nin the fall. Their culture is that recommended for egg-plants. A small\r\nseedsman’s packet of seed will be sufficient for a large number of\r\nplants, say two hundred. The large bell peppers (Fig. 312) are the\r\nmildest, and are used for making “stuffed peppers” and other dishes.\r\nThe small, hot peppers are used for seasoning and sauces.\r\n\r\nPotato.—The potato is rather more a field crop than a home-garden\r\nproduct; yet the home-gardener often desires to grow a small early lot.\r\n\r\nThe common practice of growing potatoes on elevated ridges or hills is\r\nwrong, unless the soil is so wet that this practice is necessary to\r\ninsure proper drainage (but in this case the land is not adapted to the\r\ngrowing of potatoes), or unless it is necessary, in a particular place,\r\nto secure a very early crop. If the land is elevated into ridges or\r\nhills, there is great loss of moisture by means of evaporation. During\r\nthe last cultivating the potatoes may be hilled up slightly in order to\r\ncover the tubers; but the hills should not be made in the beginning for\r\nthe main crop if land and conditions are right.\r\n\r\nLand for potatoes should be rather loamy in character, and ought to\r\nhave a liberal supply of potash, either naturally or supplied in the\r\ndrill, by means of an application of sulfate of potash. See that the\r\nland is deeply plowed or spaded, so that the roots can penetrate\r\ndeeper. Plant the potatoes 3 or 4 inches below the natural surface of\r\nthe ground. It is ordinarily best to drop the pieces in drills. A\r\ncontinuous drill or row may be made by dropping one piece every 6\r\ninches, but it is usually thought best to drop two pieces about every\r\n12 to 18 inches. The drills are far enough apart to allow good\r\ncultivation. If horse cultivation is used, the drills should be at\r\nleast 3 feet apart.\r\n\r\nSmall potatoes are considered not to be so good as large ones for\r\nplanting. One reason is because too many sprouts arise from each one,\r\nand these sprouts are likely to crowd each other. The same is true of\r\nthe tip end or seed end of the tuber. Even when the tip is cut off, the\r\neyes are so numerous that one secures many weak shoots rather than two\r\nor three strong ones. It is ordinarily best to cut the potatoes to two\r\nor three eyes, leaving as much tuber as possible with each piece. From\r\n7 to 10 bushels of potatoes are required to plant an acre.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV. The garden radish, grown in fall of the usual spring sorts. XXV.\r\nThe garden radish, grown in fall of the usual spring sorts.\r\n\r\nFor a very early crop in the garden, tubers are sometimes sprouted in\r\nthe cellar. When the sprouts are 4 to 6 inches high, the tubers are\r\ncarefully planted. It is essential that the sprouts are not broken in\r\nthe handling. In this practice, also, the tubers are first cut into\r\nlarge pieces, so that they will not dry out too much.\r\n\r\nThe staple remedy for the potato bug is Paris green, 2 pounds or more\r\nof poison to 150 to 200 gallons of water, with a little lime. For the\r\nblight, spray with bordeaux mixture, and spray thoroughly. Bordeaux\r\nmixture will also keep away the flea beetle to a large extent.\r\n\r\nRadish (Plate XXV).—In all parts of the country the radish is popular\r\nas a side-dish, being used as an appetizer and for its decorative\r\ncharacter. It is a poor product, however, if misshapen, wormy, or\r\ntough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 313. French Breakfast and olive-shaped radishes.]\r\n\r\nRadishes should be grown quickly in order to have them at their best.\r\nThey become tough and woody if grown slowly or allowed to stay in the\r\nground too long. A light soil, well enriched, will grow most of the\r\nearly varieties to table size in three to five weeks. To have a supply\r\nthrough the early months, sowings should be made every two weeks. For\r\nspring use, the French Breakfast is still a standard variety (Fig.\r\n313).\r\n\r\nFor summer, the large white or gray varieties are best. The winter\r\nvarieties may be sown in September, harvested before severe frosts, and\r\nstored in sand in a cool cellar. When they are to be used, if thrown\r\ninto cold water for a short time they will regain their crispness.\r\n\r\nSow radishes thickly in drills, 12 to 18 inches apart. Thin as needed.\r\n\r\nRhubarb, or Pie plant.—A strong perennial herb, to be grown in a bed or\r\nrow by itself at one end or side of the garden. It is a heavy feeder.\r\n\r\nRhubarb is usually propagated by division of the fleshy roots, small\r\npieces of which will grow if separated from the old established roots\r\nand planted in rich mellow soil. Poor soil should be made rich by\r\nspading out at least 3 feet of the surface, filling with well-rotted\r\nmanure to within 1 foot of the level, throwing in the top soil and\r\nsetting the roots with the crowns 4 inches below the surface, firming\r\nthem with the feet. The stalks should not be cut for use until the\r\nsecond year. See that the plant does not want for water when it is\r\nmaking its heavy leaf growth. In fall, coarse manure should be thrown\r\nover the crowns, to be forked or spaded in lightly when spring opens.\r\n\r\nIn growing seedling rhubarb, the seed may be sown in a coldframe in\r\nMarch or April, protected from freezing, and in two months the plants\r\nwill be ready to set in rows, 12 inches apart. Give the plants good\r\ncultivation, and the following spring they may be set in a permanent\r\nplace. At this time the plants should be set in well-prepared ground,\r\nat a distance each way of 4 to 5 feet, and treated as those set with\r\npieces of roots.\r\n\r\nIf given good care and well manured, the plants will live for years and\r\nyield abundantly. Two dozen good roots will supply a large family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 314. Salsify, or oyster plant.]\r\n\r\nSalsify, or Vegetable oyster (Fig. 314).—Salsify is one of the best of\r\nwinter and early spring vegetables, and should be grown in every\r\ngarden. It may be cooked in several different ways, to bring out the\r\noyster flavor.\r\n\r\nThe seed should be sown as early in the spring as possible. Handle the\r\nsame as parsnips in every way. The roots, like parsnips, are the better\r\nfor the winter freeze, but part of the crop should be dug in the fall,\r\nand stored in soil or moss in a cellar for winter use.\r\n\r\nSea-kale is a strong-rooted perennial, the shoots of which are very\r\nhighly prized as a delicacy when blanched.\r\n\r\nSeed should be sown in a hotbed early in the spring, plants\r\ntransplanted to the garden when from 2 to 3 inches high, and given good\r\ncultivation through the season, being covered with litter on the\r\napproach of winter. The young stalks are blanched early the following\r\nspring by covering with large pots or boxes, or by banking with sand or\r\nother clean material. The Dwarf Green Scotch, Dwarf Brown, and Siberian\r\nare among the leading varieties. Sea-kale is eaten much as asparagus\r\nis. It is highly prized by those who know it.\r\n\r\nSea-kale is also propagated by cuttings of the roots 4 or 5 inches\r\nlong, planted directly in the soil in spring. The plant being\r\nperennial, the early shoots may be bleached year after year.\r\n\r\nSorrel of the European garden sorts may be sown in spring, in drills 16\r\ninches apart in beds, or 3 to 3-1/2 feet apart in rows. After the\r\nplants are well established they should be thinned to 10 to 12 inches\r\napart in the rows. They are perennial, and may be kept growing in the\r\nsame place for several years. Broad-leaved French is the most popular\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nSpearmint is prized by many persons as a seasoning, particularly for\r\nthe Thanksgiving and holiday cookery.\r\n\r\nIt is a perennial and perfectly hardy, and will live in the open garden\r\nyear after year. If a supply of the fresh herbage is wanted in winter,\r\nremove sods of it to the house six weeks before wanted. Place the sods\r\nin boxes, and treat as for house plants. The plants should have been\r\nfrosted and become perfectly dormant before removal.\r\n\r\nSpinach.—The most extensively grown of all “greens,” being in season in\r\nearliest spring, and in fall and winter.\r\n\r\nThe earliest spinach that finds its way to market is produced from seed\r\nsown in September or October, often protected by frames or other means\r\nthrough the severe winter, and cut soon after growth starts in early\r\nspring. Even as far north as New York spinach may stand over winter\r\nwithout protection.\r\n\r\nSpinach is forced by placing sash over the frames in February and\r\nMarch, protecting the young leaves from severe freezing by mats or\r\nstraw thrown over the frames.\r\n\r\nSeed may be sown in early spring for a succession; later in the season\r\nseed of the New Zealand summer spinach may be sown, and this will grow\r\nthrough the heat of the summer and yield a fine quality of leaves. The\r\nseed of this kind, being very hard, should be scalded and allowed to\r\nsoak a few hours before sowing. This seed is usually sown in hills\r\nabout 3 feet apart, sowing four to six seed in each hill.\r\n\r\nThe spring and winter spinach should be sown in drills 12 to 14 inches\r\napart, one ounce being sufficient for 100 feet of drill. Remember that\r\ncommon spinach is a cool-weather (fall and spring) crop.\r\n\r\nSquash.—The summer squashes rarely fail of a crop if they once escape\r\nthe scourge of the striped beetle. The late varieties are not so\r\ncertain; they must secure a strong start, and be on “quick” fertile\r\nwarm land in order to make a crop before the cool nights of fall (Fig.\r\n315).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 315. One of the so-called Japanese type of squash\r\n(_Cucurbita moschata_).]\r\n\r\nThe time of planting, method of preparing the hills, and after-culture\r\nare the same as for cucumbers and melons, except that for the early\r\nbush varieties the hills should be 4 or 5 feet apart, and for the later\r\nrunning varieties from 6 to 8 feet apart. From eight to ten seeds\r\nshould be planted in each hill, thinning to four plants after danger\r\nfrom bugs is over. Of the early squashes, one ounce of seed will plant\r\nfifty hills; of the later varieties, one ounce will plant but eighteen\r\nto twenty hills. For winter use, varieties of the Hubbard type are\r\nbest. For summer use, the Crooknecks and Scallop squashes are popular.\r\nIn growing winter squashes in a Northern climate, it is essential that\r\nthe plants start off quickly and vigorously: a little chemical\r\nfertilizer will help.\r\n\r\nPumpkins are grown the same as squashes.\r\n\r\nSweet-potato is rarely grown north of Philadelphia; in the South it is\r\na universal garden crop.\r\n\r\nSweet-potatoes are grown from sprouts planted on ridges or hills, not\r\nby planting the tubers, as with the common or Irish potato. The method\r\nof obtaining these sprouts is as follows: In April, tubers of\r\nsweet-potatoes are planted in a partially spent hotbed by using the\r\nwhole tuber (or if a large one, by cutting it in two through the long\r\nway), covering the tubers with 2 inches of light, well-firmed soil. The\r\nsash should be put on the frames and only enough ventilation given to\r\nkeep the potatoes from decaying. In ten or twelve days the young\r\nsprouts should begin to appear, and the bed should be watered if dry.\r\nThe sprouts when pulled from the tuber will be found to have rootlets\r\nat the lower end and along the stems. These sprouts should be about 3\r\nto 5 inches long by the time the ground is warm enough to plant them\r\nout on their ridges.\r\n\r\nThe ridges or hills should be prepared by plowing out a furrow 4 to 6\r\ninches deep. Scatter manure in the furrow and plow back the soil so as\r\nto raise the center at least 6 inches above the level of the soil. On\r\nthis ridge the plants are set, placing the plants well in to the leaves\r\nand about 12 to 18 inches apart in the rows, the rows being from 3 to 4\r\nfeet apart.\r\n\r\nThe after-cultivation consists in stirring the soil between the ridges;\r\nand as the vines begin to run they should be lifted frequently to\r\nprevent rooting at the joints. When the tips of the vines have been\r\ntouched by frost the crop may be harvested, the tubers left to dry a\r\nfew days, and stored in a dry, warm place.\r\n\r\nTo keep sweet potatoes, store in layers in barrels or boxes in dry\r\nsand, and keep them in a dry room See that all bruised or chilled\r\npotatoes are thrown out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 316. A good form or type of tomato.]\r\n\r\nTomato.—The tomato is an inhabitant of practically every home garden,\r\nand everybody understands its culture (Fig. 316).\r\n\r\nThe early fruits are very easily grown by starting the plants in a\r\ngreenhouse, hotbed, or in shallow boxes placed in windows. A pinch of\r\nseed sown in March will give all the early plants a large family can\r\nuse. When the plants have reached the height of 2 or 3 inches, they\r\nshould be transplanted into 3-inch flower-pots, old berry boxes, or\r\nother receptacles, and allowed to grow slowly and stocky until time to\r\nset them out, which is from May 15 on (in New York). They should be set\r\nin rows 4 or 5 feet apart, the plants being the same distance in the\r\nrows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 317. A tomato trellis.]\r\n\r\nSome support should be given to keep the fruits off the ground and to\r\nhasten the ripening. A trellis of chicken-wire makes an excellent\r\nsupport, as does the light lath fencing that may be bought or made at\r\nhome. Stout stakes, with wire strung the length of the rows, afford an\r\nexcellent support. A very showy method is that of a frame made like an\r\ninverted V, which allows the fruits to hang free; with a little\r\nattention to trimming, the light reaches the fruits and ripens them\r\nperfectly (Fig. 317). This support is made by leaning together two lath\r\nframes.\r\n\r\nThe late fruits may be picked green and ripened on a shelf in the sun;\r\nor they will ripen if placed in a drawer.\r\n\r\nOne ounce of seed will be enough for from twelve to fifteen hundred\r\nplants. A little fertilizer in the hill will start the plants off\r\nquickly. The rot is less serious when the vines are kept off the ground\r\nand the rampant suckers are cut out. Varieties pass out and new ones\r\ncome into notice, so that a list is of small permanent value.\r\n\r\nTurnips and Rutabagas are little grown in home gardens; and yet a finer\r\nquality of vegetable than most persons know could be secured if these\r\nplants were raised on one’s own soil and brought fresh to the table.\r\nThey are usually a fall crop, from seed sown in July and early August,\r\nalthough some kitchen-gardens have them from spring-sown The culture is\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nTurnips should be grown in drills, like beets, for the early crop. The\r\nyoung plants will stand light frosts. Choose a rainy day for planting,\r\nif practicable. Cover the seed very lightly. Thin the young plants to 5\r\nto 7 inches in the row. Sow every two weeks if a constant supply is\r\ndesired, as turnips rapidly become hard and woody in warm summer\r\nweather. For the fall and winter crop in the North,\r\n\r\n“On the fourteenth day of July,\r\nSow your turnips, wet or dry.”\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the northern and middle states tradition fixes the\r\n25th of July as the proper time for sowing flat turnips for winter use.\r\nIn the middle states, turnips are sometimes sown as late as the end of\r\nAugust. Prepare a piece of very mellow ground, and sow the seed thinly\r\nand evenly broadcast. In spite of the old rhyme, a gentle shower will\r\nthen be acceptable. These turnips are pulled after frost, the tops\r\nremoved, and the roots stored in cellars or pits.\r\n\r\nFor the early crop, Purple-top Strap-leaf, Early White Flat Dutch, and\r\nEarly Purple-top Milan are the favorite varieties. Yellow-fleshed sorts\r\nlike Golden Ball are very fine for early table use, when well grown,\r\nbut most eaters prefer white turnips in spring, although they\r\noccasionally patronize the yellow varieties in the fall. Yellow Globe\r\nis the favorite yellow fall turnip, though some persons grow yellow\r\nrutabagas and call them turnips. For late crop of white turnips, the\r\nsame varieties chosen for spring sowing are also desirable.\r\n\r\nRutabagas are distinguished from turnips by their smooth, bluish\r\nfoliage, long root, and yellow flesh. They are richer than turnips;\r\nthey require the same treatment, except that the season of growth is\r\nlonger. Fall-sown or summer-sown bagas should have a month the start of\r\nflat turnips.\r\n\r\nExcept the maggot (see cabbage maggot), there are no serious insects or\r\ndiseases peculiar to turnips and bagas.\r\n\r\nWatermelon.—The watermelon is shipped everywhere in such enormous\r\nquantities, and it covers so much space in the garden, that\r\nhome-gardeners in the North seldom grow it. When one has room, it\r\nshould be added to the kitchen-garden.\r\n\r\nThe culture is essentially that for muskmelons (which see), except that\r\nmost varieties require a warmer place and longer period of growth. Give\r\nthe hills a distance of 6 to 10 feet apart. Choose a warm, “quick” soil\r\nand sunny exposure. It is essential, in the North, that the plants grow\r\nrapidly and come into bloom early. One ounce of seed will plant thirty\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nThere are several white or yellow-fleshed varieties, but aside from\r\ntheir oddity of appearance they have little value. A good watermelon\r\nhas a solid, bright red flesh, preferably with black seeds, and a\r\nstrong protecting rind. Kolb Gem, Jones, Boss, Cuban Queen, and Dixie\r\nare among the best varieties. There are early varieties that will ripen\r\nin the Northern season, and make a much better melon than those secured\r\non the market.\r\n\r\nThe so-called “citron,” with hard white flesh, used in making\r\npreserves, is a form of watermelon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nSEASONAL REMINDERS\r\n\r\nThe author assumes that a person who is intelligent enough to make a\r\ngarden, does not need an arbitrary calendar of operations. Too exact\r\nadvice is misleading and unpractical. Most of the older gardening books\r\nwere arranged wholly on the calendar method—giving specific directions\r\nfor each month in the year. We have now accumulated sufficient fact and\r\nexperience, however, to enable us to state principles; and these\r\nprinciples can be applied anywhere,—when supplemented by good\r\njudgment,—whereas mere rules are arbitrary and generally useless for\r\nany other condition than that for which they were specifically made.\r\nThe regions of gardening experience have expanded enormously within the\r\npast fifty and seventy-five years. Seasons and conditions vary so much\r\nin different years and different places that no hard and fast advice\r\ncan be given for the performing of gardening operations, yet brief\r\nhints for the proper work of the various months may be useful as\r\nsuggestions and reminders.\r\n\r\nThe Monthly Reminders are compiled from files of the “American Garden”\r\nof some years back, when the author had editorial charge of that\r\nmagazine. The advice for the North (pages 504 to 516) was written by T.\r\nGreiner, La Salle, N.Y. well known as a gardener and author. That for\r\nthe South (pages 516 to 526) was made by H.W. Smith, Baton Rouge, La.,\r\nfor the first nine months, and it was extended for “Garden-Making” to\r\nthe months of October, November, and December by F.H. Burnette,\r\nHorticulturist of the Louisiana Experiment Station.\r\n\r\n\r\nKITCHEN-GARDEN PLANTING TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nA GUIDE TO THE PROPER TIMES FOR SOWING OF VARIOUS SEEDS IN ORDER TO\r\nOBTAIN CONTINUOUS SUCCESSION OF CROPS\r\n\r\nExplanation of Signs Used In the Table.\r\n\r\n(0)To be sown in open ground without transplanting. Plants have to be\r\nthinned out, given proper distance.\r\n\r\n(1) Sow in seed bed in the garden, and transplant thence to permanent\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n(2) Make two sowings in open ground during the month.\r\n\r\n(3) Make three sowings in open ground during the month.\r\n\r\n(4) Start in greenhouse or hot-bed, and plant out so soon as the ground\r\nis in good shape, and weather permits.\r\n\r\n(5) Sow in open ground as soon as it can be worked.\r\n\r\n(6) To be grown only in hot-bed or greenhouse.\r\n\r\n(7) Sow in cold frame, keep plants there over winter with a little\r\nprotection; plant out in spring as soon as the ground can be worked.\r\n\r\n(8) To be sown in open ground, and protected with litter over winter.\r\n\r\n(9) Plant in frame.

Roots from these sowings will, the next year, attain a size\r\ndouble that usually seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 318. Bird’s-eye view of the seasons in which the\r\nvarious garden products may be in their prime.]\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS AND REMINDERS.—I. FOR THE NORTH\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY\r\n\r\n_Cabbage plants_ in frames need free airing whenever the temperature is\r\nabove the freezing point, or so long as the soil of the bed is not\r\nfrozen. Snow, in that case, should be removed soon after its fall. As\r\nlong as the soil is frozen the snow can safely be left on for a number\r\nof days. Cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce seed should be sown at\r\nintervals to secure plants for extra-early sales or setting. A month\r\nlater they will be ready to transfer to boxes, which should go to the\r\ncoldframe and be given protection by mats or shutters.\r\n\r\n_Coldframes_ must be well ventilated on warm, sunny days; leave the\r\nsashes off as long as is possible without injury to the plants. Keep\r\nthe soil in a friable condition, and look carefully to any possible\r\nplaces where water can stand and freeze. If the frames seem too cold,\r\nbank up around them with coarse manure.\r\n\r\n_Hotbeds_.—Look up and repair the sashes. Save the horse-manure from\r\nday to day, rejecting dry litter, and piling up the droppings and\r\nurine-soaked bedding in thin layers to prevent violent heating.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce_ in frames treat as advised for cabbage plants.\r\n\r\n_Pruning_ should now be considered. Perhaps it is best to prune\r\nfruit-trees in March or April, but grapes and currants and gooseberries\r\nmay be pruned now. January and February are good months in which to\r\nprune peach trees. Thin out the peach trees well, taking care to remove\r\nall the dead wood. If you have much pruning to do in apple, pear, or\r\nplum orchards, you will save time by utilizing the warm days now. Study\r\nwell the different methods of pruning. Never let an itinerant pruner\r\ntouch your trees until you are satisfied that he understands his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n_Tools_ should now be inspected and repaired, and any new ones that are\r\nneeded made or ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY\r\n\r\n_Cabbage_.—Sow seed of Jersey Wakefield in flats filled with light\r\nloamy soil, the last week of this month. Sow thinly, cover lightly, and\r\nplace the boxes in a gentle hotbed or any warm, sunny situation. When\r\nthe plants are strong, transplant them into flats 1-1/2 in. apart each\r\nway. As growth begins, gradually expose them to the open air on all\r\nfavorable occasions. Late in March remove them to a coldframe, and\r\nproperly harden them off before setting them in the open ground.\r\n\r\n_Celery_.—We urgently advise every one who has a garden, large or\r\nsmall, to make a trial of the new celery-culture. You need, first, good\r\nplants. Get some seed of White Plume or Golden Self-blanching, and sow\r\nit thickly in flats filled with fine loam. Cover by sifting a thin\r\nlayer of sand or fine soil over it, and firm well. Keep in a moderately\r\nwarm place, watering as needed, until plants appear. If you have a\r\nnumber of flats, they may be placed on top of one another. At the first\r\nsign of plant-growth, bring the flats gradually to the light. When the\r\nplants are 1-1/2 or 2 in. high, transplant them into other flats,\r\nsetting them in rows 2-1/2 in. apart, the plants half an inch apart in\r\nthe rows. Then set the flats in a coldframe until the plants are large\r\nenough to plant out in the open ground.\r\n\r\n_Hotbeds_ for raising early plants should be made this month. Always\r\nbreak the manure up fine and tread it down well. Be sure to put enough\r\nin the center of beds, so that there will be no sagging. Fresh manure\r\nof hard-worked and well-fed horses, free from dry litter, is best. An\r\naddition of leaves used for bedding will serve to produce a more\r\nmoderate but more lasting heat. Sheep-manure may also be added to the\r\nhorse-manure, should there be a scant supply of the latter on hand.\r\n\r\n_Onions_.—We urgently advise giving the new onion-culture a trial. For\r\nseed, buy a packet or an ounce of Prizetaker, Spanish King, White\r\nVictoria, or some other large kind of globe onion. Sow the seed in\r\nflats, in a hotbed, or in a greenhouse late in the month, and\r\ntransplant the onions to the open ground as soon as the latter is in\r\nworking condition. Set the plants in rows 1 ft. apart and about 3 in.\r\napart in the row.\r\n\r\n_Plums_.—Make a thorough inspection of all plum and cherry trees, wild\r\nand cultivated, for plum-knot. Cut and burn all the knots found. Remove\r\nall “mummy” plums, for they spread the fruit-rot.\r\n\r\n_Rhubarb_.—Give the plants in the garden a heavy dressing of fine old\r\ncompost. If you wish a few early stalks, place kegs or boxes over some\r\nof the plants, and heap over them some heating horse-manure.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH\r\n\r\n_Beets_.—A few seeds may be sown in the hotbed.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage, cauliflower, and celery_ seeds may be sown for the early\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n_Egg-plants._—Seeds should be sown. Take care that the young plants are\r\nnever stunted.\r\n\r\n_Grafting_ may be done in favorable weather. Cherries and plums must be\r\ngrafted early. Use liquid grafting-wax in cold weather.\r\n\r\n_Hotbeds_ may be made at any time, but do not grow impatient about the\r\nwork, for there will be cold weather yet. Clean, fresh manure is\r\nnecessary, and a layer 2 ft. thick should be tramped hard. When once\r\nstarted and the seeds sown, do not let the beds get too hot. Give them\r\nair on fine days and give the seedlings plenty of water. Use two\r\nthermometers—one to test the atmosphere and the other the heat of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce_ should be sown in the hotbed for an early crop.\r\n\r\n_Onion_ seed for the new onion-culture may be sown at the close of the\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n_Peas_.—Sow now, if the ground can be worked.\r\n\r\n_Peppers_ may be sown late in the month.\r\n\r\n_Potatoes_ kept for seed must not be allowed to sprout. Keep them in a\r\ntemperature near freezing point. Rub off the sprouts from potatoes kept\r\nfor eating, and pick out all decayed specimens.\r\n\r\n_Spinach_.—Sow some seeds for an early crop.\r\n\r\n_Tomato_ seeds may be sown in the hotbeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL\r\n\r\n_Artichokes_.—Sow the seeds for next year’s crop. A deep, rich, sandy\r\nloam is best. Fork in a dressing of well-rotted manure around the old\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n_Asparagus_.—Spade in some good manure in the bed, and give the soil a\r\nthorough working before the crowns start. Sow seeds in the open ground\r\nfor young plants for a new bed.\r\n\r\n_Beans_.—Limas may be started on sods in a hotbed or a coldframe\r\ntowards the last of the month.\r\n\r\n_Beets_.—The ground should be prepared and the seed sown for beets for\r\ncattle as soon as the weather will permit. Put them in before planting\r\ncorn. They will stand considerable cold weather, and should be planted\r\nearly to get a start of the weeds.\r\n\r\n_Blackberries_ should be pruned, the brush drawn off, piled, and\r\nburned. If it is necessary, to stake them, try a wire trellis, the same\r\nas for grapes, putting on one wire 2-1/2 ft. high. The young plants\r\nshould be dug before the buds start.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage_ seed may be sown in the open ground, in coldframes, or in\r\npans or boxes in the house. Early varieties should be started at once.\r\nCabbages like a rich and heavy loam, with good drainage. Give them all\r\nthe manure you can get.\r\n\r\n_Cauliflower_ seeds may be sown toward the last of the month. They\r\nshould never have a check from the time the seed is sown until\r\nharvested.\r\n\r\n_Carrot_.—Sow the seed of early sorts, like Early Forcing, as soon as\r\nthe ground can be worked.\r\n\r\n_Celery_.—Plan to grow celery by the new method. Plenty of manure and\r\nmoisture are required to do this. Sow the seed in light, rich soil in\r\nthe house, hotbed, coldframe, or open ground. Transplant the plants\r\nonce before setting them in the field. Page 505.\r\n\r\n_Cress_.—Sow early and every two or three weeks. Watercress should be\r\nsown in damp soil or in streams. The outer edges of a hotbed may also\r\nbe utilized. Cress is often a profitable crop when rightly handled.\r\n\r\n_Cucumber_ seeds may be sown on sods in the hotbed.\r\n\r\n_Egg-plant._—Sow in the hotbed, and transplant when 2 in. high to other\r\nbeds or pots. They must have good care, for a check in their growth\r\nmeans all the difference between profit and loss.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce_.—Sow the seeds in the hotbed, and in the open ground as soon\r\nas it can be worked. Plants sown a month ago should be transplanted.\r\n\r\n_Leek_.—Sow the seeds in the open ground in drills 6 in. apart and 1\r\nin. deep, and when large enough, thin to 1 in. in the row.\r\n\r\n_Muskmelon_.—Plant seeds in sods in the hotbed.\r\n\r\n_Parsnip_.—Dig the roots before they grow and become soft and pithy.\r\nSeeds may be sown as soon as the ground is dry enough to work.\r\n\r\n_Parsley_.—Soak the seeds in warm water for a few hours, and sow in the\r\nopen ground.\r\n\r\n_Peas_.—Sow the seeds as soon as the ground can be worked. They will\r\nstand considerable cold and transplanting also. Time may be gained by\r\nsowing some seeds in moist sand in a box in the cellar and\r\ntransplanting when well sprouted. Plant deep in light, dry soil; cover\r\nan inch at first, and draw in the earth as the vines grow.\r\n\r\n_Potatoes_.—Plant early on rich soil free from blight and scab. For a\r\nvery early crop, the potatoes may be sprouted before planting.\r\n\r\n_Peppers_.—Sow the seeds in the hotbed or in the boxes in the house.\r\n\r\n_Radish_ seeds may be sown in the open ground or in the hotbed and the\r\ncrop harvested from there. The small, round varieties are best for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n_Strawberries_.—Give a good, thorough cultivation between the rows and\r\nthen remove the mulch from the plants, placing it in the rows, where it\r\nwill help to keep the weeds down.\r\n\r\n_Salsify_.—Sow the seeds as soon as the ground can be worked. Give the\r\nsame care and cultivation as for carrots or parsnips.\r\n\r\n_Spinach_ seeds must be sown early, and then every two weeks for a\r\nsuccession. Thin out and use the plants before they send up\r\nflower-stalks.\r\n\r\n_Squashes_.—Hubbards and summer squashes may be started on sods in the\r\nhotbed.\r\n\r\n_Tomato_.—Sow in the hotbed or in shallow boxes in the house. Try some\r\nof the yellow varieties; they are the finest flavored of any.\r\n\r\nMAY\r\n\r\n_Beans_.—The bush sorts may be planted in the open ground, and limas in\r\npots or sods in a coldframe or spent hotbed. Limas require a long\r\nseason to mature, and should be started early.\r\n\r\n_Beets_.—Sow for a succession. Transplant those started under glass.\r\n\r\n_Cabbages_ always do best on a freshly turned sod, and should be set\r\nbefore the land has had time to dry after plowing. The secret of\r\nsuccess in getting a large yield of cabbage is to start with rich land\r\nand put on all the manure obtainable. Clean out the hog yard for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n_Cucumbers_.—Sow in the open ground toward the last of the month. A few\r\nmay be started as advised for lima beans.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce_.—Sow for a succession, and thin to 4 in. in the rows.\r\n\r\n_Melons_.—Plant in the open ground toward the end of the month. It is\r\nuseless to plant melons and other cucurbitaceous plants until settled\r\nweather has arrived.\r\n\r\n_Onions_.—Finish planting and transplanting, and keep all weeds down,\r\nboth in the seed-bed and the open field.\r\n\r\nPeas.—Sow for a succession.\r\n\r\n_Squashes_.—Plant as advised for melons and cucumbers. They require a\r\nrich, well-manured soil.\r\n\r\n_Strawberries_.—Remove the blossoms from newly set plants. Mulch with\r\nsalt hay or marsh hay or clean straw or leaves those that are to bear.\r\nMulching conserves moisture, keeps the berries clean, and prevents\r\nweeds from growing.\r\n\r\n_Sweet corn_.—Plant early and late varieties, and by making two or\r\nthree plantings of each, at intervals, a succession may be kept up all\r\nsummer and fall. Sweet corn is delicious, and one can hardly have too\r\nmuch of it.\r\n\r\n_Tomatoes_.—Set some early plants by the middle of the month or earner,\r\nif the ground is warm, and the season early and fair. They may be\r\nprotected from the cold by covering with hay, straw, cloth, or paper,\r\nor even with earth. The main crop should not be set until the 20th or\r\n25th, or until all danger of frost is over. However, tomatoes will\r\nstand more chilly weather than is ordinarily supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE\r\n\r\n_Asparagus_.—Cease cutting and allow the shoots to grow. Keep the weeds\r\ndown and the soil well stirred. An application of a quick commercial\r\nfertilizer or of liquid manure will be beneficial.\r\n\r\n_Beans_.—Sow the wax sorts for succession. As soon as a crop is off,\r\npull out the vines and plant the ground to late cabbage, turnips, or\r\nsweet corn.\r\n\r\n_Beets_.—Transplant in rows 1 to 3 ft. apart and 6 in. in the row. Cut\r\noff most of the top, water thoroughly, and they will soon start.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage and cauliflower_.—Set plants for the late crop. Rich, newly\r\nturned sod and a heavy dressing of well-rotted manure go a long way\r\ntoward assuring a good crop.\r\n\r\n_Celery_.—Set the main crop, and try the new method of setting the\r\nplants 7 in. apart each way, if you have rich land and can irrigate,\r\nbut not unless these conditions are present. Page 505.\r\n\r\n_Cucumbers_ may yet be planted, if done early in the month.\r\n\r\n_Currants_.—Spray with Paris green for the currant worm until the fruit\r\nsets. Hellebore is good, but it is difficult to get it of good\r\nstrength; use it for all late spraying.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce_.—Sow for succession in a moist, cool, and partially shaded\r\nspot. The seed does not germinate well in hot weather.\r\n\r\n_Lima beans_ should be hoed frequently, and started on the poles if\r\nthey are contrary.\r\n\r\n_Melons_.—Cultivate often and watch for the bugs. A screen of closely\r\nwoven wire or mosquito netting may be used to cover the vines, or\r\ntobacco dust sifted on thickly.\r\n\r\n_Onions_.—Keep free from weeds and stir the ground frequently and\r\nespecially after every rain.\r\n\r\n_Squashes_.—Keep the ground well cultivated and look out for bugs. (See\r\n_Melons_.) Layer the vines and cover the joints with fresh soil, to\r\nprevent death of the vines from the attacks of the borer.\r\n\r\n_Strawberries_.—Plow up the old bed that has borne two crops, as it\r\nwill usually not pay to keep it. Set the ground to late cabbage or some\r\nother crop. The young bed that has borne the first crop should have a\r\nthorough cultivation and the plow run close to the rows to narrow them\r\nto the required width. Pull up or hoe out all weeds and keep the ground\r\nclean the rest of the season. This applies with equal force to the\r\nnewly set bed. A bed can be set late next month from young runners.\r\nPinch off the end after the first joint, and allow it to root on a sod\r\nor in a small pot set level with the surface.\r\n\r\n_Tomatoes_.—For an early crop train to a trellis, pinch off all side\r\nshoots, and allow all the strength to go to the main stalk. They may\r\nalso be trained to poles, the same as lima beans, and can be set closer\r\nif grown in this way. Spray with the bordeaux mixture for the blight,\r\nkeep the foliage thinned and the vines off the ground.\r\n\r\n_Turnips_.—Sow for an early fall crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY\r\n\r\n_Beans_.—Sow the wax sorts for a succession.\r\n\r\n_Beets_.—Sow Early Egyptian or Eclipse for young beets next fall.\r\n\r\n_Blackberries_.—Head back the young canes to 3 ft., and the laterals\r\nalso when they get longer. They may be pinched with the thumbnail and\r\nfinger in a small patch, but this soon makes the fingers sore, and when\r\nthere are many bushes to go over, it is better to use a pair of shears\r\nor a sharp sickle.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage_.—Set plants for the late crop.\r\n\r\n_Corn_.—Plant sweet corn for succession and late use.\r\n\r\n_Cucumbers_.—It is late to plant, but they may be put in for pickles if\r\ndone before the Fourth. Cultivate those which are up, and keep an eye\r\nopen for bugs.\r\n\r\n_Currants_.—Cover a few bushes with muslin or burlap before the fruit\r\nripens, and you can eat currants in August. Use hellebore, rather than\r\nParis green, for the last brood of currant worms, and apply it as soon\r\nas the worms appear. There is little danger in using it, even if the\r\ncurrants are ripe.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce_ seed does not germinate well in hot weather. Sow in a moist,\r\nshaded position for a succession.\r\n\r\n_Lima beans_.—Hoe them frequently, and give assistance to get on the\r\npoles.\r\n\r\n_Melons_.—Watch for bugs, and apply tobacco dust freely around the\r\nplants. Keep them well cultivated. A light application of bone meal\r\nwill pay.\r\n\r\n_Peaches, pears, and plums_ should be thinned to secure fine fruit and\r\nto help sustain the vigor of the tree. Ripening the seed is what draws\r\non the tree’s vitality, and if the number of seeds can be reduced\r\none-half or two-thirds, part of the strength required to ripen them\r\nwill go into perfecting the fruit and seeds left, and add greatly to\r\nthe fine appearance, flavor, and quality of the edible portion.\r\n\r\n_Radishes_.—Sow the early kinds for a succession, and toward the end of\r\nthe month the winter sorts may be put in.\r\n\r\n_Raspberries_.—Pinch back the canes to 2-1/2 ft., the same way as given\r\nfor blackberries.\r\n\r\n_Squashes_.—Keep the ground well stirred, and use tobacco dust freely\r\nfor bugs and beetles. Cover the joints with fresh soil, to guard\r\nagainst injury by the vine-borer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST\r\n\r\n_Beets_.—A last sowing of the early table sorts may be made for a\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage_.—Harvest the early crop, and give good cultivation to the\r\nmain crop. Keep down the bugs and worms.\r\n\r\n_Celery_.—The latest crop may yet be set. Earlier set plants should be\r\nhandled as they attain sufficient size. Common drain tiles are\r\nexcellent for blanching if one has them, and must be put on when the\r\nplants are about half grown. Hoe frequently to keep the plants growing.\r\n\r\n_Onions_.—Harvest as soon as the bulbs are well formed. Let them lie on\r\nthe ground until cured, then draw to the barn floor or some other airy\r\nplace and spread thinly. Market when you can get a good price, and the\r\nsooner the better.\r\n\r\n_Tomatoes_ may be hastened in coloring by being picked just as they\r\nbegin to color and placed in single layers in a coldframe or hotbed,\r\nwhere they can be covered with sash.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the North it is not too late to sow rye, or peas, or\r\ncorn, to afford winter protection for orchards. As a rule, very late\r\nfall plowing for orchards is not advisable. Now is a good time to trim\r\nup the fence-rows and to burn the brush piles, in order to destroy the\r\nbreeding places of rabbits, insects, and weeds. Cuttings of\r\ngooseberries and currants may be taken. Use only the wood of the\r\ncurrent year’s growth, making the cuttings about a foot long. Strip off\r\nthe leaves, if they have not already fallen, tie the cuttings in large\r\nbundles, and bury them in a cold cellar, or in a sandy, well-drained\r\nknoll; or if the cutting-bed is well prepared and well drained, they\r\nmay be planted immediately, the bed being well mulched upon the\r\napproach of winter. September and October are good months in which to\r\nset orchards, provided the ground is well prepared and well drained,\r\nand is not too much exposed to sweeping winds. Wet lands should never\r\nbe set in the fall; and such lands, however, are not fit for orchards.\r\nStrawberries may still be set; also bush fruits.\r\n\r\nSeeds of various flowers may now be sown for winter bloom, if one has a\r\nconservatory or good window. Petunias, phloxes, and many annuals make\r\ngood window plants. Quicker results are secured, however, if border\r\nplants of petunias and some other things are dug up just before frost\r\nand placed in pots or boxes. Keep them cool and shaded for a couple of\r\nweeks, cut down the tops, and they will send up a vigorous and\r\nfloriferous growth. Winter roses should now be in place in the beds or\r\nin pots.\r\n\r\nThere will be odd days when one can go to the woods and fields and\r\ncollect roots of wild herbs and shrubs for planting in the yard or\r\nalong the unused borders of the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER\r\n\r\n_Asparagus_.—Old plantations should now be cleaned off, and the tops\r\nremoved at once. This is a good time to apply manure to the beds. For\r\nyoung plantations, which may be started now as well as in spring,\r\nselect a warm soil and sunny exposure, and give each plant plenty of\r\nroom. We like to set them in rows 5 ft. apart and at least 2 ft. apart\r\nin the rows.\r\n\r\n_Cabbages_.—The heads that will winter best are those just fully\r\nformed, not the over-ripe ones. For family use, bury an empty barrel in\r\na well-drained spot, and fill it with good heads. Place a lot of dry\r\nleaves on top, and cover the barrel so that it will shed rain. Or, pile\r\nsome cabbages in a corner of the barn floor and cover them with enough\r\nstraw to prevent solid freezing. Pages 159, 470.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage-plants,_ started from seed last month, should be pricked out\r\nin cold-frames, putting about 600 to the ordinary sash and setting them\r\nquite deep.\r\n\r\n_Chicory_.—Dig what is wanted for salad, and store it in sand in a dry\r\ncellar.\r\n\r\n_Endive_.—Blanch by gathering up the leaves and tying them lightly at\r\nthe tips.\r\n\r\n_General garden management_.—The only planting that can be done in open\r\nground at this time is restricted to rhubarb, asparagus, and perhaps\r\nonion-sets. Begin to think about next year’s planting, and to make\r\narrangements for the manure that will be needed. Often you can purchase\r\nit now to good advantage, and haul it while the roads are yet good.\r\nClean up and plow the ground when the crops are harvested.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce_.—Plants to be wintered over should be set in frames like\r\ncabbage-plants.\r\n\r\n_Onions_.—Plant sets of Extra Early Pearl, or some other hardy kind, in\r\nthe same fashion as in early spring. They are likely to winter well,\r\nand will give an early crop of fine bunching onions. For the North,\r\nfall sowing of onion-seed cannot be recommended.\r\n\r\n_Parsley_.—Lift some plants and set them in a coldframe 4 or 5 in.\r\napart, or in a box filled with good soil, and place in a light cellar\r\nor under a shed.\r\n\r\n_Pears_.—Pick the winter sorts just before there is danger from\r\nfreezing. Put them in a cool, dark place, where they will neither mold\r\nnor shrivel. To hasten ripening, they may be brought into a warm room\r\nas wanted.\r\n\r\n_Rhubarb_.—If plants are to be set or replanted this fall, enrich the\r\nground with a superabundance of fine old stable-manure, and give each\r\nplant a few feet of space each way. In order to have fresh pie-plant in\r\nwinter, dig up some of the roots and plant them in good soil in a\r\nbarrel placed in the cellar.\r\n\r\n_Sweet-potatoes._—Dig them when ripe after the first frost. Cut off the\r\nvines, and turn the potatoes out with a potato-fork or plow. Handle\r\nthem carefully to prevent bruising. Only sound, well-ripened roots are\r\nin proper condition to be wintered over.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER\r\n\r\n_Asparagus_.—Manure before winter sets in.\r\n\r\n_Beets_.—They keep best in pits. Some may be kept in the cellar for use\r\nduring winter, but cover them with sand or sods to prevent shriveling.\r\n\r\n_Blackberries_.—Cut away the old wood and mulch the roots. Tender sorts\r\nshould be laid down and lightly covered with soil at the tips.\r\n\r\n_Carrots_.—Treat as advised for beets.\r\n\r\n_Celery_.—Dig up the stalks, leaving the roots on, and stand them close\r\ntogether in a narrow trench, tops just even with the ground-level.\r\nGradually cover them with boards, earth, and manure. Another way is to\r\nset them upright upon the floor of a damp cellar or root-house, keeping\r\nthe roots moist and the tops dry. Celery can stand some frost, but not\r\nexposure to less than 22° F. The stalks intended for use before\r\nChristmas may in most localities be left outdoors, to be used as\r\nwanted. Should cold weather set in early, they will need covering in\r\nsome way. Page 475.\r\n\r\n_Orchard management_.—Young trees should have a mound of earth raised\r\naround the stem as a support and protection against mice, etc. Small\r\nand lately planted trees may have stakes set beside them, and be tied\r\nto the stakes with a broad band. Apple and pear trees may yet be\r\nplanted. Trim superfluous or unhealthy wood out of the old orchards.\r\n\r\n_Spinach_.—Cover the beds lightly with leaves or litter before winter\r\nsets in.\r\n\r\n_Strawberries_.—Soon it will be time to mulch the beds. Provide marsh\r\nhay, or other coarse litter, free from weed-seeds, and when the ground\r\nhas frozen an inch or so, spread it all over the surface thinly and\r\nevenly.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER\r\n\r\n_Cabbages_.—Plants in coldframes should be aired freely and kept cool.\r\nHeads intended for winter and spring use, if not yet taken in or\r\nprotected from severe freezing, must now be cared for. Do not cover\r\nthem too deeply, nor store them in too warm a place.\r\n\r\n_Carrots_.—Store them in cellars or pits. If in cellars, keep the roots\r\ncovered with sand or sod, to prevent wilting.\r\n\r\n_General garden management_.—Begin now to make your plans for next\r\nseason’s work. Carefully study up the matter of rotation, also that of\r\nfeeding your crops in the most effective and economical manner. Repair\r\nframes, sashes, and tools. Clear up the garden and premises. Underdrain\r\nwhere needed. Beds for early vegetables should be thrown up in high,\r\nnarrow ridges, with deep furrows between. This will enable you to plant\r\nthem several days or weeks earlier than otherwise.\r\n\r\n_Kale_.—In very exposed or northern locations cover it lightly with\r\ncoarse litter.\r\n\r\n_Onions_.—For winter storage select only well-ripened, perfectly dry\r\nbulbs. Store them in a dry, airy place, not in the cellar. They may be\r\nspread out thinly on the floor, away from the walls, allowed to freeze\r\nsolid, and then covered several feet deep with hay or straw.\r\n\r\n_Parsnips_.—Take up some roots for winter use and store them in sand in\r\nthe cellar.\r\n\r\n_Strawberry-beds_ should be given their winter covering of marsh hay,\r\netc., as soon as the ground is frozen solid.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS AND REMINDERS.—II. FOR THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY\r\n\r\n_Annuals_.—All kinds of hardy annuals and perennials, such as alyssum,\r\nsnapdragon, foxglove, hollyhock, phlox, poppy, pansy, lobelia,\r\ncandytuft, sweet pea, Chinese pink, sweet william, larkspur, foliage\r\ncinerarias, centaurea, mignonette, and many others of the same class\r\nmay be sown. Most of them should be sown thinly and where they are\r\nintended to flower, as they transplant poorly in this latitude.\r\n\r\n_Cannas, caladiums, perennial phloxes, chrysanthemums, and verbenas_\r\nmay be taken up, divided, and replanted.\r\n\r\n_Roses_ may be planted in quantities. Let the ground intended for them\r\nhave a thorough dressing of manure. Occasionally a plant may be taken\r\nup and divided. The hybrid varieties may now be layered. This is done\r\nas follows: Select a shoot and bend it flat upon the ground; hold it in\r\nboth hands, having a distance of about 6 in. between them; keep the\r\nleft hand firm, and with the right give the shoot a sharp twist; now\r\ncover it with 4 in. of earth and tie the free end to an upright stake.\r\n\r\n_Asparagus beds_ should be liberally manured. New beds should now be\r\nmade. Set the plants 6 in. deep. Sow seed now.\r\n\r\n_Beets and all hardy vegetables_ (carrots, parsnips, turnips,\r\nrutabagas, kohlrabi, spinach, lettuce, herbs, etc.) may now be sown,\r\nplanted, or transplanted.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage plants_ should be set out on heavily manured ground. Sow seed\r\nof Early Summer for a later supply.\r\n\r\n_Fruits_.—If possible, all planting and transplanting of fruit-trees\r\nand grape-vines should be finished this month. Pruning should be\r\ncompleted as soon as possible, and preparation made to protect the\r\nblossoms of tender fruits next month. Set out strawberry-plants, and\r\nduring dry weather run the cultivator through all old beds that are at\r\nall weedy. It is a good plan, where practicable, to mulch the beds.\r\nHere, pine-straw can be had plentifully for the purpose. Examine peach\r\ntrees for borers. Raspberries and blackberries should be pruned now if\r\nthe work is not already done. Cuttings of Le Conte pears, Marianna\r\nplums, grape-vines, and pomegranates should be put in at once if they\r\nhave heretofore been forgotten. Root-grafting should be progressing\r\nrapidly; this is the best time for this important work.\r\n\r\n_Onion seeds_.—Sow at once, and plant sets as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n_Peas_.—Sow early and late varieties. The late varieties succeed best\r\nif sown at this season.\r\n\r\n_Seasonable work_.—This is a good month to obtain canes for staking\r\npeas, tomatoes, and beans, hauling manure, making repairs, and\r\nexamining tools, etc. As the fall crop is harvested, the land should be\r\nprepared for another crop. Tile-draining is now is order. Prepare\r\nframes to cover with canvas for use next month.\r\n\r\n_Sweet-potatoes._—A few may be bedded in a frame from which to obtain\r\n“draws” for setting out about March 15.\r\n\r\n_Tomatoes, egg-plants, and peppers_.—Sow now on a slight hotbed. When\r\nthe plants come up, all the air possible should be given during the\r\nday. They can be raised without heat, but at this season this plan\r\nwould better be attempted only by the skillful.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY\r\n\r\n_Asters, cannas, dahlias, heliotropes, lobelias, petunias, pyrethrums,\r\nricinus, salvias, and verbenas_ are best sown in a coldframe, where\r\nthey can have some protection from heavy rain.\r\n\r\n_Cannas_ should be transplanted now.\r\n\r\n_Chrysanthemums_ must be planted in well-manured ground in a position\r\nwhere water can be readily supplied to them.\r\n\r\n_Dahlias_ may be taken up and divided as soon as they begin growth.\r\n\r\n_Gladiolus and tuberose bulbs_ should be planted now. It is a good plan\r\nto extend the planting through March and April.\r\n\r\n_Pansies_.—Plant them out in the beds where they are to flower.\r\n\r\n_Routine work_.—Sodding should now proceed rapidly. If sods cannot be\r\nobtained, the ground may be planted with Bermuda grass. Plant small\r\npieces of the grass a foot apart and water them if the weather is dry,\r\nand they will grow rapidly. Hedges should be cleared up and put in good\r\nshape. All planting of trees and shrubs should be finished this month.\r\nAll pruning of trees must be done early in the month. Young roses\r\ncannot be set too early in February. They thrive best when planted in\r\nfall. Roll the drives and repair them when necessary. The lawn will now\r\nrequire constant care, and the mower should be used before the grass\r\nbecomes 1-1/2 in. high.\r\n\r\n_Bush-beans_ may be planted February 14. On alluvial land it is best to\r\nplant them on slight rises as a protection against the rains which\r\nsometimes occur toward the end of the month. If frost should threaten\r\njust as the beans begin to peep out, cover them an inch deep with the\r\nplow or hand cultivator. Sow Early Mohawk first, and at the end of the\r\nmonth sow Early Valentine; a week later sow the wax varieties.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage_,—Sow early varieties, such as Early Summer, Early Drumhead,\r\nand Early Flat Dutch. Etampes, Extra Early Express, and Winnigstadt\r\nsown for small heads in the order named have done very well in southern\r\nLouisiana. The earlier sown plants should be transplanted as often as\r\nconvenient. Should worms cause trouble, dust the plants with a mixture\r\nof one part of pyrethrum powder to six of fine dust.\r\n\r\n_Carrots, celery, beets, endive, kohlrabi, onion sets, parsley,\r\nparsnips, radishes and purple-top turnips_ must now be sown.\r\n\r\n_Corn_.—Plant Extra Early Adams, Yellow Canada, Stowell Evergreen, and\r\nWhite Flint toward the middle of the month. Sow again a week later, and\r\nagain after another week. If the first two sowings fail, the last one\r\nwill give the early crop.\r\n\r\n_Cucumbers_.—Sow and protect with small boxes during cold days and\r\nnights, or sow in pots or on sods. Protect the seedlings with sashes or\r\ncanvas, and plant them out late.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce_.—Sow seeds and transplant the plants on hand. This crop\r\nrequires a soil well supplied with plant-food.\r\n\r\n_Melons_.—Plant seeds in the same manner as advised for cucumbers.\r\n\r\n_Okra_.—Sow seeds on sods and set out the plants next month.\r\n\r\n_Peas_.—Sow seeds of a number of varieties.\r\n\r\n_Peppers and egg-plants_, if not sown last month, should be sown now.\r\nSow them under glazed sashes and keep close. When the plants appear,\r\ngive some air, and increase it according to the weather. If a large\r\nnumber of plants is required, the sowing may be delayed until next\r\nmonth. Should flea-beetles trouble you, use plenty of bordeaux on\r\negg-plants.\r\n\r\n_Potatoes, Irish_.—The main crop should be planted as early as\r\npossible. Standard varieties are Early Rose, Peerless, and Burbank.\r\n\r\n_Strawberries_.—Run the cultivator through them at least once every\r\nthree weeks; if they are to be mulched, collect the necessary material.\r\nStrawberries planted in February seldom yield much of a crop.\r\n\r\n_Sweet-potatoes_, can now be bedded and protected with canvas, or a row\r\nor two of whole tubers may be planted for “draws” and vines.\r\n\r\n_Tomatoes_ in frames should be given all the air and light possible and\r\nplenty of room if protected with canvas, do not allow the plants to\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH\r\n\r\n_Beans_.—Sow all varieties for a fall crop. As soon as the plants\r\nappear, the cultivator must be run through the crop, and kept going as\r\noften as necessary.\r\n\r\n_Corn_.—Continue to plant; and we recommend harrowing the patch as soon\r\nas the young corn appears. It is generally planted in hills 3 or 4 ft.\r\napart, but better results will be obtained-by planting in drills and\r\nleaving one stalk every 12 in.\r\n\r\n_Cucumbers_.—Sow in hills 4 ft. apart, using a liberal quantity of seed\r\nto each hill. When the plants come up, thin them to about six in the\r\nhill. When the plants begin to get rough leaves, pull out one or two\r\nmore from each hill. Striped cucumber-beetles are sometimes very\r\nnumerous, and in order to get a stand of plants it is necessary to go\r\nthrough the patch early every morning and sprinkle all the hills with\r\nair-slaked lime.\r\n\r\n_Egg-plants._—Toward the end of the month the plants growing in frames\r\nmay be transplanted to their fruiting quarters. Seed may be sown\r\noutside after March 15; sooner if a warm and sheltered spot is\r\nselected.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce_.—Sow in drills, and when the plants are large enough, thin to\r\na foot apart. If transplanted at this season, they often go to seed.\r\n\r\n_Okra_.—A sowing may be made now, but the main planting would best be\r\ndeferred until after March 15. Sow in drills 3 ft. apart and thin the\r\nplants to 18 in. apart in the drills.\r\n\r\n_Peas_.—Early varieties may be sown; it is now too late to sow\r\ntall-growing kinds.\r\n\r\n_Peppers_.—Treat as advised for egg-plants.\r\n\r\n_Potatoes, Irish_.—It is not too late to plant them, but the sooner\r\nthey are planted the better. The crop planted in February should be\r\nharrowed as soon as the shoots begin to come up, and when the rows can\r\nbe fairly seen, the cultivator must be set to work to keep down weeds\r\nand grass.\r\n\r\n_Squashes_.—Plant seed in hills 6 ft. apart. The directions for\r\nplanting melons may be followed. The same remarks apply to pumpkins and\r\nother vegetables of this kind.\r\n\r\n_Sweet-potatoes._—If slips or vines are at hand, they may be planted\r\nlate in the month for the earliest tubers. The whole potatoes may be\r\nplanted on a ridge to yield vines for later planting.\r\n\r\n_Strawberries_.—The mulching of beds or rows should be no longer\r\ndelayed, if clean and plentiful fruit is wanted.\r\n\r\n_Tomatoes_.—About March 15 the frame plants may go to their fruiting\r\nquarters. It is necessary to use some judgment in this matter, as they\r\nmay be killed or injured by an April frost. Seed may be sown in the\r\nopen ground for plants for late fruiting. Set the plants 4 ft. apart\r\neach way.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL\r\n\r\n_Alternantheras_ should go out now.\r\n\r\n_Annuals_ of all kinds may still be sown where they are to flower, as\r\nthey transplant with difficulty at this season.\r\n\r\n_Coleuses_.—Plant out in the beds now. Cuttings root readily, simply\r\nrequiring to be stuck in.\r\n\r\n_Beans_ of all kinds can be planted, limas especially.\r\n\r\n_Beets_.—Make another sowing.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage plants_ obtained from spring sowings should be set out as soon\r\nas fit. The ground requires to be very rich to carry this crop.\r\n\r\n_Cucumbers_.—These can be sown anywhere now.\r\n\r\n_Corn_.—Make a sowing to yield roasting ears to come in after that sown\r\nlast month.\r\n\r\n_Okra_.—Sow in drills 3 or 4 ft. apart.\r\n\r\n_Peas_.—Make a sowing of early varieties for the last time.\r\n\r\n_Squash (bush) and pumpkin_ may now be planted.\r\n\r\n_Tomatoes_ should be got out to their fruiting quarters as early in the\r\nmonth as possible. Let them be set at least 4 ft. apart each way.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY\r\n\r\n_Beans_.—Plant a few more bush and pole beans.\r\n\r\n_Celery_ may now be started. The bed or box needs plenty of water, and\r\nshould be shaded from sun.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce_ requires careful handling to encourage it to germinate. It is\r\nbest sown in a box and kept shaded and moist.\r\n\r\n_Melons, cucumbers, squashes, and pumpkins_ may be sown.\r\n\r\n_Radishes_.—Sow the yellow and white summer varieties.\r\n\r\n_Remarks_.—It is a constant struggle with weeds throughout this month,\r\nand the cultivator and plow are ever going. As the land becomes vacant,\r\nsow corn or plant sweet-potatoes—draws or vines. Sow some late Italian\r\ncauliflower. Let the orchard have constant and thorough cultivation,\r\nand remove all unnecessary growth from the trees as soon as they\r\nappear. Be always on the lookout for borers. Keep the strawberries as\r\nfree of grass and coco, or knob-grass, as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE\r\n\r\n_Beans_.—All kinds may now be sown.\r\n\r\n_Cauliflower_.—Sow the Italian kinds.\r\n\r\n_Corn_.—Make a planting at the beginning of the month and again at the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n_Cucumbers_.—Plant a few more hills. The plants at this season must be\r\ngiven plenty of water.\r\n\r\n_Endive_.—Sow, and attend to the tying up of the plants that are of\r\nsufficient size.\r\n\r\n_Melons_.—Sow for a succession a few more water and muskmelons.\r\n\r\n_Okra_ may still be sown.\r\n\r\n_Radishes_.—Sow the summer varieties now.\r\n\r\n_Squashes and pumpkins_ may yet be sown.\r\n\r\n_Sweet-potato_ vines may now be set out in quantities.\r\n\r\n_Tomatoes_.—About the middle of the month sow for the fall crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY\r\n\r\n_Beans_.—Bush and pole beans may be planted towards the end of the\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage and cauliflower_ may now be sown, but the main sowing should\r\nbe deferred until next month.\r\n\r\n_Carrots_.—A sowing should be made.\r\n\r\n_Celery_.—Sow and transplant what plants there may be on hand.\r\n\r\n_Cucumbers_.—These may be sown now for pickling.\r\n\r\n_Endive_.—Transplant and sow.\r\n\r\n_Grapes_ should be kept well tied to trellis, and unnecessary growth\r\nremoved, so that the wood may have the chance of becoming thoroughly\r\nripened. If the cultivator and plow are not used judiciously, a second\r\ngrowth will be started, which is not desirable.\r\n\r\n_Lettuce_.—The seed requires to be sprouted before being sown, and if\r\nthe sowing is done on a dry day the drills should be watered.\r\n\r\n_Radishes_.—Sow the summer kinds.\r\n\r\n_Strawberries_.—Keep the beds clean of weeds and grass.\r\n\r\n_Tomatoes_.—Make a sowing early in the month, or, what is much better,\r\ntake cuttings from plants still in bearing.\r\n\r\n_Turnips_.—Sow a few after a shower towards the end of the month.\r\n\r\n_Remarks_.—Much cannot be done this month, as the weather is hot and\r\ndry, but the opportunity should not be lost for killing weeds and\r\npreparing for the planting season, which is now rapidly drawing near.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST\r\n\r\n_Artichokes_.—Seed of the Green Globe may be sown now and large plants\r\nobtained by spring. The seed-bed requires to be shaded.\r\n\r\n_Bush beans, beets, pole beans, carrots, celery, endive, kohlrabi,\r\nlettuce, mustard, Black Spanish and Rose China radishes, parsley,\r\nturnips, rutabagas, and salad plants_ of all kinds may now be sown. The\r\nseed should be sown on small ridges, adaptable to the kind of plants,\r\nfor level culture is not successful in the vegetable garden in this\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n_Broccoli_ should be more grown, for it is hardier than the\r\ncauliflower. Many cannot tell the difference between the two. Sow now.\r\n\r\n_Cabbages_ must be sown by the middle of the month. Make the ground\r\nvery rich and shade the seed-bed, keeping it moist during the whole of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\n_Cauliflower_ should also be sown.\r\n\r\n_Potatoes, Irish_, should be planted by the middle of the month, if\r\npossible. Plant only those that have sprouted, and instead of planting\r\non top of the ridge set in the furrow and cover 2 in. deep; as the\r\npotatoes grow, work more soil down to them.\r\n\r\n_Salsify_.—Sow now or early next month.\r\n\r\n_Shallots_.—Plant them now.\r\n\r\n_Squash_.—Bush kinds may be planted now at any time.\r\n\r\n_Sweet-potatoes._—Vines may still be set out, with prospects of\r\nharvesting a fair crop.\r\n\r\n_Tomatoes_.—If short of plants, cut off good-sized limbs from bearing\r\nplants and plant them deep. Keep them moist, and they will root in a\r\nfew days. Do this just before it rains.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER\r\n\r\n_Annuals_ of the hardy class may be sown this month: the following list\r\nwill assist in making a selection: Calliopsis, candytuft, calendulas,\r\ncanterbury bells, columbine, corn-flower, daisies, forget-me-nots,\r\ngaillardia, godetia, larkspur, _Limnanthes Douglasii_, mignonette,\r\npansies, _Phlox Drummondii_, primroses, poppies of all kinds,\r\n_Saponaria Calabrica, Silene pendula_, sweet williams, and sweet peas.\r\n\r\n_Bulbs_.—Study the catalogues and make out your wants, for it is\r\nnearing planting time.\r\n\r\n_Lilies_.—If success is required of the St. Joseph’s or Virgin lily\r\n(_L. candidum_), it must be planted right away.\r\n\r\n_Perennials and biennials_ should be sown early this month. They have\r\ntwo good growing months ahead of them yet to make considerable\r\nprogress. The seed-bed will require shade during the middle of the day\r\nuntil the young plants come up; frequent weedings will be required, as\r\ncoco has not yet quit growing, and winter weeds are now putting in an\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n_Remarks_.—All plants used for salad purposes may be sown this month.\r\nThe ground between the rows of growing crops should be kept in a fine,\r\nfriable condition. Vegetable seeds of all kinds should always be sown\r\non slight ridges on all but very sandy soils. If the seed is sown on a\r\nlevel bed, as practiced at the North, the ground will become as hard as\r\na turnpike road should a heavy rain occur; and should this shower come\r\nalong before the plants are up, a crust a quarter of an inch deep will\r\nbe formed, and the plants will never see daylight. Sown on a ridge they\r\ncome all right, as the water gradually drains away, leaving the top of\r\nthe ridge loose and soft.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER\r\n\r\n_All spring flower seeds_ should be sown in boxes or trays in the\r\nconservatory, and all spring bulbs should be planted. The hyacinth,\r\nnarcissus, tulip and anemone, ranunculus and various lily bulbs, will\r\nbloom in good season planted at this time. The bedding plants should be\r\ncarefully watched, so that any attack of aphis may be treated\r\nimmediately. Sweet peas may be planted the first of this month,\r\nalthough they are commonly sown in September. A rich spot should be\r\nselected for them. This is the time to make the new lawn. The soil\r\nshould be thoroughly stirred and well pulverized, mixing in a good\r\ndressing of commercial fertilizer, or, if one prefers it, a mixture\r\nwhich may be made at home, consisting of cotton-seed meal, acid\r\nphosphate, and sulfate of potash, at the rate of 1000 lb., 300 lb., and\r\n100 lb. respectively, per acre. A rich, well-rotted compost, as a top\r\ndressing, would also be highly beneficial. Roses pruned late in\r\nSeptember or early this month will produce fine winter blooms.\r\n\r\n_In the garden_ this is a busy month; some of the winter vegetables are\r\ngrowing, and others should be sown. The bud artichokes should be\r\nseparated and set fully 3 ft. apart. Onions may still be sown in the\r\nearly part of the month, and shallots should be divided and set. Some\r\nbeans may be risked, and English peas sown for winter crop. A few\r\ncauliflowers may be tried and cucumbers planted in pots for the hotbeds\r\nnext month. The following vegetables should be sown: Carrots, corn\r\nsalad, chervil, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, beets, endive, kohlrabi,\r\nkale, lettuce, leeks, mustard, parsley, parsnip, radish, roquette,\r\nspinach, Swiss chard, salsify. Some cabbage and a few cauliflowers\r\nshould be added to the list. Turnips should be sown for succession\r\nevery two weeks until April or May. The celery should be kept growing\r\nand banking up commenced.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent time to plant the new strawberry bed. Make the bed\r\nrich with well-rotted manure and select good, healthy sets. The\r\nMichel’s Early and Cloud are probably the most popular varieties for\r\ngeneral planting, and should be set in alternating rows.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER\r\n\r\n_Flower seeds and bulbs_ may be planted this month of the same\r\nvarieties as in October. Cuttings of all the herbaceous plants should\r\nbe made and potted, for use in the house and for the borders next\r\nseason. The coldframes should also be put in order. Some of the bulbs\r\nfor winter forcing should be selected and potted. One of the best\r\nLouisiana gardeners recommends the following treatment: Select good,\r\nstrong bulbs and plant them in rich, light soil, in 5-in. pots,\r\ncovering them about half an inch. Water well and bury the pots 6 or 8\r\nin. deep in the ground, leaving them there about five weeks, when the\r\nbulbs will be found to be well rooted. From this time gradually expose\r\nto the light, and they will soon put forth blooms.\r\n\r\n_The same vegetables_ may be sown as for October, and the late cabbage\r\nseed planted. The Flat Dutch and Drumhead strains are prime favorites.\r\nNew sowings of peas, turnips, mustard, and radishes should be made, and\r\nthe hotbeds prepared and set out to cucumbers. Too much care cannot be\r\ntaken that the manure should be in the best condition possible, so that\r\na good supply of heat may be depended upon. The cucumbers planted last\r\nmonth will be ready now for setting in the hotbeds, and a winter crop\r\nforced.\r\n\r\n_Orchard and vineyard planting_.—This is the time to prepare land. That\r\non which a late crop of cowpeas has grown is well suited for the\r\npurpose, and should be plowed deeply and well worked over. Towards the\r\nlast of the month it should be cultivated again, in order to be ready\r\nfor the trees next month.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER\r\n\r\n_Lawns and yards_ need watching this month, and attention should be\r\npaid to the old leaves and fall rubbish, which makes the yard look\r\nuntidy. A good place for the leaves is the compost heap. Hedges should\r\nbe put in shape and the surface drains kept open. Shrubs and roses\r\nshould be pruned for an early supply of flowers. The Camellia Japonicas\r\nare now in bloom, and care should be taken that the small branches are\r\nnot torn off, instead of being cut properly. Many of these most\r\nbeautiful of southern ornamental trees have been ruined by careless\r\nplucking of flowers.\r\n\r\n_Garden and orchard_.—Many of the fall vegetables may be sown this\r\nmonth and others sown for a succession. Peas, spinach, roquette,\r\nradishes, lettuce, endive, and some Early York cabbage should also be\r\nsown. In the old spent hotbeds, tomatoes, peppers, and egg-plants may\r\nbe started; there will not be enough heat to hurry them, and good,\r\nstrong stocky plants will be secured if care is taken. Irish potatoes\r\nmay be risked, should there be a favorable time for planting during the\r\nlatter part of the month. Usually they are planted in January. The\r\nchances are about equal should they be planted late this month. Nuts of\r\nall kinds, both for budding and otherwise, should be planted. Some of\r\nthe best Louisiana pecans are said to come true from seed, and may be\r\nsown where they are intended to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flowering annuals, being mostly in alphabetical list, are not\r\nindexed here.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbelia grandiflora, 306.\r\nabies species,  335, 336.\r\nAbobra viridiflora, 311.\r\nabutilons, 351.\r\nacacia, rose, 300.\r\nacalypha, 230.\r\nacer, species, 322, 323, 330.\r\nAchillea Ptarmica, 269,  273.\r\nachyranthes, 236, 344.\r\naconites, 273.\r\nactinidia, 216, 308, 316.\r\nadiantums, 372.\r\nadlumia, 310.\r\nAdonis vernalis, 273.\r\næsculus species, 293, 323.\r\nAfrican lily, 351.\r\nagapanthus, 351.\r\nagave, 364.\r\nAgrostemma Coronaria, 274.\r\nAgrostis nebulosa, 245.\r\nailanthus, shoots of, 56.\r\nAjuga reptans, 267.\r\nakebia, 216, 308, 316.\r\nalder, 293, 323.\r\nalliums, 289.\r\nalmond, 415.\r\nalpine plants, 232.\r\nalstremeria, 352.\r\nalternanthera, 235, 237, 239.\r\nAlthæa frutex, 297.\r\nAlthæa rosea, 271.\r\nAlyssum saxatile, 267.\r\namarantus, 230.\r\namaryllis, 352.\r\nAmelanchier Canadensis, 293.\r\nammoniacal carbonate of copper, 197.\r\nampelopsis species, 308, 309, 314.\r\nandromeda, 299, 306.\r\nanemone, 264, 265, 269, 273, 274, 353.\r\nanise, 460.\r\nanise-tree, 306.\r\nannuals for bedding, 249.\r\nannuals that bloom after frost, 248.\r\nannuals by color, 246.\r\nannuals, cultivation of, 241.\r\nannuals listed by height, 251.\r\nannuals for ribbon-beds, 248.\r\nannuals, distances apart, 256.\r\nAnthemis coronaria, 344.\r\nAnthemis Kelwayi, 274.\r\nAnthemis tinctoria, 271.\r\nAntigonon leptopus, 313.\r\naphis,  198, 200.\r\nApios tuberosa, 313.\r\napple, culture of, 416.\r\napple-maggot, 199.\r\napple-scab, 207, 417.\r\napricot, culture of, 420.\r\naquarium, 348.\r\naquatic plants, 230.\r\naquilegias, 267, 269, 274.\r\nArabis albida, 265.\r\nArabis alpina, 274.\r\nAralia Sieboldii, 230, 354.\r\naraucaria, 344, 354.\r\narborvitæ, 221, 333, 336.\r\nArbutus Unedo, 306.\r\narchitect’s garden, 12.\r\nardisia, 306.\r\naristolochia, 317.\r\nArnebia echioides, 274.\r\narsenate of lead formula, 193.\r\nartemisias, 273, 365.\r\nArtemisia Stelleriana, 263.\r\nartichoke, 462, 463.\r\nAruncus Sylvester, 264.\r\nArundo Donax, 46, 264.\r\nAsclepias tuberosa, 264, 274.\r\nashes, 111.\r\nash, mountain, 329.\r\nash trees, 324, 330.\r\nasparagus, 461.\r\nasparagus beetle, 199.\r\nAsparagus medeoloides, 401.\r\nAsparagus plumosus and tenuissimus, 317, 344.\r\nasparagus rust, 208.\r\nAsparagus Sprengeri, 340.\r\naspen, 326.\r\nasperula, 269.\r\naspidistra, 340.\r\nasters, native, 264, 274, 275.\r\nAstilbe Japonica, 269.\r\nAubrietia deltoidea, 265.\r\naucuba, 344.\r\nauricula, 354.\r\nazalea, culture of, 355.\r\nazalea species, 293, 305, 306.\r\n\r\nBaccharis halimifolia, 291, 293.\r\nBacterium tumefaciens, 180.\r\nbalm, 460.\r\nbamboos, 230, 264.\r\nBaptisia tinctoria, 264.\r\nbasil, 460.\r\nbaskets, hanging, 348.\r\nbasswood, 329.\r\nbay-tree, 306.\r\nbean, 459, 463.\r\nbedding, 228.\r\nbeech, 324.\r\nbeet, 456, 466.\r\nbegonias, 356.\r\nbelladonna lily, 287, 352.\r\nBellis perennis, 265.\r\nBenzoin odoriferum, 293.\r\nBerberis Aquifolium, 293.\r\nBerberis Japonica, 306.\r\nBerberis Thunbergii, 52, 221, 292, 293, 306.\r\nBerberis vulgaris, 51, 293.\r\nBermuda buttercup, 384.\r\nBermuda-grass, 80.\r\nbetula species, 293, 323, 324.\r\nbignonia species, 314, 315.\r\nbillbergia, 344.\r\nbiota, 336.\r\nbirds, 16.\r\nbitternut, 325.\r\nbitter-sweet, 315.\r\nbitter-sweet, false, 317.\r\nblackberries, laying down 138.,\r\nblackberry, culture of, 420.\r\nblackberry, disease of, 212.\r\nblackberry insects, 205.\r\nblack-rot, 209.\r\nbladder nut, 302, 303.\r\nbleeding-heart, 267, 276.\r\nblister-mite, 199.\r\nblood as fertilizer, 112.\r\nbloodroot, 265.\r\nblue beech, 324.\r\nblue-grass, 78.\r\nBocconia cordata, 263.\r\nbog plants, 230.\r\nbolting trees, 149.\r\nboltonias, 275.\r\nboneblack, 113.\r\nbone, ground, 113.\r\nbordeaux mixture, 196.\r\nborders, making, 74, 222.\r\nborers, 199, 417.\r\nbougainvillea, 318.\r\nBoussingaultia baselloides, 313, 344.\r\nbouvardia, 344.\r\nbox, 293, 306.\r\nbox-elder, 323.\r\nboxthorn, 315.\r\nbridge-grafting, 148.\r\nBridgeman, mentioned, 2.\r\nbroccoli, 467.\r\nBromus brizæformis, 245.\r\nbrooks, treatment of,\r\nbroom, 306.\r\nbrussels sprouts,\r\nbuckthorn, 221, 299.\r\nbudding, 151.\r\nbud-moth, 200.\r\nbuffalo berry, 302.\r\nBuist, mentioned, 2.\r\nbulbocodium, 289.\r\nbulbs, culture of, 281.\r\nbulbs in window-garden, 345.\r\nburdock, ornamental, 3.\r\nBurnette, F.
