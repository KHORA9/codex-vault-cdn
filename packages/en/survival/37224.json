Sec. 13.\r\n\r\nBefore all other things, man is distinguished by his pursuit and\r\ninvestigation of TRUTH. And hence, when free from needful business and\r\ncares, we delight to see, to hear, and to communicate, and consider a\r\nknowledge of many admirable and abstruse things necessary to the good\r\nconduct and happiness of our lives: whence it is clear that whatsoever\r\nis TRUE, simple, and direct, the same is most congenial to our nature as\r\nmen. Closely allied with this earnest longing to see and know the truth,\r\nis a kind of dignified and princely sentiment which forbids a mind,\r\nnaturally well constituted, to submit its faculties to any but those who\r\nannounce it in precept or in doctrine, or to yield obedience to any\r\norders but such as are at once just, lawful, and founded on utility.\r\nFrom this source spring greatness of mind and contempt of worldly\r\nadvantages and troubles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I.\r\n\r\n  THE WEIGHT OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER.

Among these subjects may be reckoned the question, \"How\r\nmany pounds does the whole earth weigh?\"\r\n\r\nOne would, indeed, believe that this is easy to answer. A person might\r\nassign almost any weight, and be perfectly certain that nobody would run\r\nafter a scale, in order to examine, whether or not an ounce were\r\nwanting. Yet this question is by no means a joke, and the answer to it\r\nis by no means a guess; on the contrary, both are real scientific\r\nresults. The question in itself is as important a one, as the answer,\r\nwhich we are able to give, is a correct one.\r\n\r\nKnowing the size of our globe, one would think that there was no\r\ndifficulty in determining its weight. To do this, it would be necessary\r\nonly to make a little ball of earth that can be accurately weighed; then\r\nwe could easily calculate how many times the earth is larger than this\r\nlittle ball; and by so doing, we might tell, at one's finger-ends,\r\nthat--if we suppose the little earth-ball to weigh a hundred-weight--the\r\nwhole globe, being so many times larger, must weigh so many\r\nhundred-weights.\r\n\r\nSuch a proceeding, however, would be very likely to mislead us. For all\r\ndepends on the substance the little ball is made of. If made of loose\r\nearth, it will weigh little; if stones are taken with it, it will weigh\r\nmore; while, if metals were put in, it would, according to the kind of\r\nmetal you take, weigh still more.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we wish to determine the weight of our globe by the weight of\r\nthat little ball, it is first necessary to know of what our globe\r\nconsists; whether it contains stones, metals, or things entirely\r\nunknown; whether empty cavities, or whether, indeed, the whole earth is\r\nnothing but a hollow sphere, on the surface of which we live, and in\r\nwhose inside there is possibly another world that might be reached by\r\nboring through the thick shell.\r\n\r\nWith the exercise of a little thought, it will readily be seen that the\r\nquestion, \"How much does our earth weigh?\" in reality directs us to the\r\ninvestigation of the character of the earth's contents; this, however,\r\nis a question of a scientific nature.\r\n\r\nThe problem was solved not very long ago. The result obtained was, that\r\nthe earth weighs 6,069,094,272 billions of tons; that, as a general\r\nthing, it consists of a mass a little less heavy than iron; that towards\r\nthe surface it contains lighter materials; that towards the centre they\r\nincrease in density; and that, finally, the earth, though containing\r\nmany cavities near the surface, is itself not a hollow globe.\r\n\r\nThe way and manner in which they were able to investigate this\r\nscientifically, we will attempt now to set forth as plainly and briefly\r\nas it can possibly be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE ATTEMPT TO WEIGH THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is our task to explain, by what means men have succeeded in weighing\r\nthe earth, and thus become acquainted with the weight of its\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\nThe means is simpler than might be thought at the moment. The execution,\r\nhowever, is more difficult than one would at first suppose.\r\n\r\nEver since the great discovery of the immortal Newton, it has been known\r\nthat all celestial bodies attract one another, and that this attraction\r\nis the greater, the greater the attracting body is. Not only such\r\ncelestial bodies as the sun, the earth, the moon, the planets, and the\r\nfixed stars, but _all_ bodies have this power of attraction; and it\r\nincreases in direct proportion to the increase of the mass of the body.\r\nIn order to make this clear, let us illustrate it by an example. A pound\r\nof iron attracts a small body near by; two pounds of iron attract it\r\nprecisely twice as much; in other words, the greater the weight of an\r\nobject, the greater the power of attraction it exercises on the objects\r\nnear by. Hence, if we know the attractive power of a body, we also know\r\nits weight. Nay, we would be able to do without scales of any kind in\r\nthe world, if we were only able to measure accurately the attractive\r\npower of every object. This, however, is not possible; for the earth is\r\nso large a mass, and has consequently so great an attractive power, that\r\nit draws down to itself all objects which we may wish other bodies to\r\nattract. If, therefore, we wish to place a small ball in the\r\nneighborhood of ever so large an iron-ball, for the purpose of having\r\nthe little one attracted by the large one, this little ball will, as\r\nsoon as we let it go, fall to the earth, because the attractive power of\r\nthe earth is many, very many times greater than that of the largest\r\niron-ball; so much greater is it, that the attraction of the iron-ball\r\nis not even perceptible.\r\n\r\nPhysical science, however, has taught us to measure the earth's\r\nattractive power very accurately, and this by a very simple instrument,\r\nviz., a pendulum, such as is used in a clock standing against the wall.\r\nIf a pendulum in a state of rest--in which it is nearest to the\r\nearth--is disturbed, it hastens back to this resting-point with a\r\ncertain velocity. But because it is started and cannot stop without the\r\napplication of force, it recedes from the earth on the other side. The\r\nearth's attraction in the meanwhile draws it back, making it go the same\r\nway over again. Thus it moves to and fro with a velocity which would\r\nincrease, if the earth's mass were to increase; and decrease, if the\r\nearth's mass were to decrease. Since the velocity of a pendulum may be\r\nmeasured very accurately by counting the number of vibrations it makes\r\nin a day, we are able also to calculate accurately the attractive power\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nA few moments' consideration will make it clear to everybody, that the\r\nprecise weight of the earth can be known so soon as an apparatus is\r\ncontrived, by means of which a pendulum may be attracted by a certain\r\nknown mass, and thus be made to move to and fro. Let us suppose this\r\nmass to be a ball of a hundred pounds, and placed near a pendulum. Then\r\nas many times as this ball weighs less than the earth, so many times\r\nmore slowly will a pendulum be moved by the ball.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that the experiment was made and the desired result\r\nobtained. But it was not a very easy undertaking, and we wish,\r\ntherefore, to give our thinking readers in the next chapter a more\r\nminute description of this interesting experiment, with which we shall\r\nfor the present conclude the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENT TO WEIGH THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCavendish, an English physicist, made the first successful attempt to\r\ndetermine the attractive power of large bodies. His first care was, to\r\nrender the attraction of the earth an inefficient element in his\r\nexperiment. He did it in the following way:\r\n\r\nOn the point of an upright needle he laid horizontally a fine steel bar,\r\nwhich could turn to the right and left like the magnetic needle in a\r\ncompass-box. Then he fastened a small metallic ball on each end of the\r\nsteel bar. The balls were of the same weight, for this reason the steel\r\nbar was attracted by the earth with the same force at both ends; it\r\ntherefore remained horizontal like the beam of a balance, when the same\r\nweight is lying in each of the scales. By this the attractive force of\r\nthe earth was not suspended, it is true; but it was balanced by the\r\nequality of the weights. Thus the earth's attractive power was rendered\r\nineffective for the disturbance of his apparatus.\r\n\r\nNext he placed two large and very heavy metallic balls at the ends of\r\nthe steel bar, not, however, touching them. The attractive force of the\r\nlarge balls began now to tell; it so attracted the small ones that they\r\nwere drawn quite near to the large balls. When, then, the observer, by a\r\ngentle push, removed the small balls from their resting-place, the large\r\nones were seen to draw them back again. But as the latter could not stop\r\nif once started, they crossed their resting-point, and began to vibrate\r\nnear the large balls in the same manner as a pendulum does, when acted\r\nupon by the attractive force of the earth. Of course this force was\r\nexceedingly small, compared with that of the earth; and for that reason\r\nthe vibrations of this pendulum were by far slower than those of a\r\ncommon one. This could not be otherwise; and from the slowness of a\r\nvibration, or from the small number of vibrations in a day, Cavendish\r\ncomputed the real weight of the earth.\r\n\r\nSuch an experiment, however, is always connected with extraordinary\r\ndifficulties. The least expansion of the bar, or the unequal expansion\r\nor contraction of the balls, caused by a change of temperature, would\r\nvitiate the result; besides, the experiment must be made in a room\r\nsurrounded on all sides by masses equal in weight. Moreover, the\r\nobserver must not be stationed in the immediate neighborhood, lest this\r\nmight exercise attractive force, and by that a disturbance. Finally, the\r\nair around must not be set in motion, lest it might derange the\r\npendulum; and lastly, it is necessary not only to determine the size and\r\nweight of the balls, but also to obtain a form spherical to the utmost\r\nperfection; and also to take care that the centre of gravity of the\r\nballs be at the same time the centre of magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn order to remove all these difficulties, unusual precautions and\r\nextraordinary expenses were necessary. Reich, a naturalist in Freiberg,\r\ntook infinite pains for the removal of these obstacles. To his\r\nobservations and computations we owe the result he transmitted to us,\r\nviz.: that the mass total of the earth is nearly five and a half times\r\nheavier than a ball of water of the same size; or, in scientific\r\nlanguage: The mean density of the earth is nearly five and a half times\r\nthat of water. Thence results the real weight of the earth as being\r\nnearly fourteen quintillions of pounds. From this, again, it follows\r\nthat the matter of the earth grows denser the nearer the centre;\r\nconsequently it cannot be a hollow sphere.\r\n\r\nIf we consider, that from the earth's surface to its centre there is a\r\ndistance of 3,956 miles, and that, with all our excavations, no one has\r\nyet penetrated even five miles, we have reason to be proud of\r\ninvestigations which, at least in part, disclose to man the unexplorable\r\ndepths of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nVELOCITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nVELOCITIES OF THE FORCES OF NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn former times, when a man would speak of the rapidity with which light\r\ntraverses space, most of his hearers thought it to be a scientific\r\nexaggeration or a myth. At present, however, when daily opportunity is\r\nafforded to admire, for example, the velocity of the electric current in\r\nthe electro-magnetic telegraph, every one is well convinced of the fact,\r\nthat there are forces in nature which traverse space with almost\r\ninconceivable velocity.\r\n\r\nA wire a mile in length, if electrified at one end, becomes in the very\r\ninstant electrified also at the other end. This and similar things every\r\none may observe for himself; then, even the greatest sceptic among you\r\nwill clearly see, that the change--or \"electric force\"--which an\r\nelectrified wire undergoes at one end, is conveyed the length of a mile\r\nin a twinkle, verily as if a mile were but an inch.\r\n\r\nBut we learn more yet from this observation. The velocity with which the\r\nelectric force travels is so great, that if a telegraph-wire, extending\r\nfrom New York to St. Louis and back again, is electrified at one end,\r\nthe electric current will manifest itself at the other end in the same\r\nmoment. From this it follows, that the electric force travels with such\r\nspeed as to make a thousand miles in a space of time scarcely\r\nperceptible. Or, in other words, it travels a thousand miles in the same\r\nimperceptible fraction of a moment that it does a single mile.\r\n\r\nAnd experience has taught us even more yet. However great the distance\r\nconnected by a telegraphic wire may be, the result has always been, that\r\nthe time which electricity needs to run that distance, is imperceptibly\r\nsmall; so that it may well be said, its passage occupies an indivisible\r\nmoment of time.\r\n\r\nOne might even be led to believe that this is really no \"running\r\nthrough\"--in other words, that this transmission of effect from one end\r\nof the wire to the other end does not require any time at all, but that\r\nit happens, as if by enchantment, in one and the same instant. This,\r\nhowever, is not the case.\r\n\r\nIngenious experiments have been tried, to measure the velocity of the\r\nelective force. It is now undoubtedly proved, that it actually does\r\nrequire time for it to be transmitted from one place to another; that\r\nthis certain amount of time is imperceptible to us for this reason,\r\nviz., that all distances which have ever been connected by telegraph,\r\nare yet too small, to make the time it takes for the current to go from\r\none end to the other, perceptible to us.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if our earth were surrounded by a wire, it would still be too\r\nshort for common observation, because the electric force would run even\r\nthrough this space--twenty-five thousand miles very nearly--in the tenth\r\npart of a second.\r\n\r\nIngenious experiments have shown that the electric current moves two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand miles in a second. But how could this have\r\nbeen ascertained? And are we certain that the result is trustworthy?\r\n\r\nThe measurements have been made with great exactitude. To those who are\r\nnot afraid of a little thinking, we will try to represent the way in\r\nwhich this measurement was taken; although a perfect representation of\r\nit is very difficult to give in a few words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHOW CAN THE VELOCITY OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT BE ASCERTAINED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate, how the velocity of the electric current can\r\nactually be measured, we must first introduce the following:\r\n\r\nWhenever a wire is to be magnetized by an electric machine, at the\r\nmoment it touches the machine, a bright spark is seen at the end of the\r\nwire. The same spark is seen also at the other end of the wire, if\r\ntouching another apparatus. Let us call the first spark the\r\n\"entrance-spark,\" the other the \"exit-spark.\" If a wire, many miles in\r\nextent, is put up, and led back to where the beginning of the wire is,\r\nboth sparks may be seen by the same observer.\r\n\r\nNow it is evident, that the exit-spark appears after the entrance-spark\r\njust as much later, as the time it took the electric current to run from\r\none end of the wire to the other end. But in spite of all efforts made,\r\nto see whether the exit-spark actually appears later, the human eye has\r\nnot been able to detect the difference. The cause of this is partly\r\nowing to the long duration of the impression upon the retina, which\r\nleads us to the belief, that we see objects much longer than we really\r\ndo; partly, the immense rapidity with which the exit-spark follows the\r\nentrance-spark. From these two causes, we are tempted to believe both\r\nsparks to appear at the same moment.\r\n\r\nBy an ingenious and excellent means, however, this defect in our eye has\r\nbeen greatly diminished. It is well worth the trouble to read a\r\ndescription of the experiment attentively. The truly remarkable way in\r\nwhich it was tried, will please all who read it.\r\n\r\nIn order to measure the velocity of the electric current, the ends of a\r\nvery long wire are placed one above the other. If, now, one makes the\r\nobservation with the naked eye, both sparks will be found to stand in a\r\nvertical line, one above the other, as the points of a colon, thus (:).\r\n\r\nBut he who wishes to measure the velocity of the electrical current does\r\nnot look upon the sparks with the naked eye, but into a small mirror,\r\nwhich, by a clock-work, is made to revolve upon an upright axis with\r\nexceedingly great rapidity. Thus he can see both sparks in the mirror.\r\nIf the apparatus be a good one, it will be observed that the sparks, as\r\nseen by the aid of the mirror, do not stand in a vertical line above one\r\nanother, but obliquely, thus (.`).\r\n\r\nWhence does this come?\r\n\r\nThe reason of it is, that after the appearance of the entrance-spark it\r\ntakes a short time, before the exit-spark appears. During this short\r\ntime the mirror moves, though but little, and in it the exit-spark is\r\nseen as if it had moved aside from the entrance-spark.\r\n\r\nHence, it is through the movement of the mirror that the time, which is\r\nnecessary for electricity to go through the circuit of the wire, is\r\nascertained. A little reflection will readily convince the reader, that\r\nthe time may be precisely calculated, provided three things be known,\r\nviz.: the length of the wire, the velocity of rotation of the mirror,\r\nand the angular distance of the two sparks as seen in the mirror. Thus:\r\nSuppose the wire to be 1,000 miles long; and suppose the mirror is made\r\nto revolve 100,000 times in a second. Now, if the electrical current\r\ntraversed these 1,000 miles of wire during _one_ revolution of the\r\nmirror, then it follows, that the current must move 1,000 miles in the\r\n1/100 part of a second; or, 100,000 miles in a second.\r\n\r\nIt is found, however, that the mirror does not revolve an entire circle,\r\nor 360 degrees, while the current is passing over 1,000 miles of wire,\r\nbut we find that the mirror turns through 144 degrees very nearly;\r\ntherefore the electric current must travel more than 100,000 miles a\r\nsecond. How much more? Just as many times 100,000 miles, as 144 degrees\r\nare contained in 360 degrees (the entire circle), viz., two and a half\r\ntimes. Hence, the current travels 250,000 miles in a second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nNUTRITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nNOTHING BUT MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nConceive a man, gifted with the keenest intellect, but not knowing from\r\nexperience, that sucklings grow and become men, and imagine what he\r\nwould say, if you were to tell him this:\r\n\r\n\"Know, that the little being you see here, is a suckling, that is, a\r\ndeveloping human being, who by and by will become thicker and taller.\r\nThe bones of his body will become firmer and longer. The muscles that\r\nanimate these bones will likewise increase in size. The same will happen\r\nwith regard to his eyes, ears, nose, mouth; to his head, body, and feet;\r\nevery component part of his small body will be developed further and\r\nfurther, until the child will become a perfect man.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, that he who does not know all this from experience,\r\nwill shake his head at it.\r\n\r\nBut if you were to tell him: \"This development and growth have their\r\nsource in the baby's sucking at the mother's breast a white juice called\r\nmilk, and out of this milk all the constituent parts of the child are\r\nmanufactured within himself,\"--certainly your hearer would laugh in your\r\nface, and perhaps call you a credulous fool.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he would exclaim, \"do you mean to say that milk contains flesh?\r\nOr can you make bones out of milk, or hair? Can you make nails and teeth\r\nout of milk? Do you wish to persuade me, that milk may be changed into\r\neyes? that from milk may be manufactured feet, hands, cheeks, eyelids,\r\nand the various other parts of the human body?\"\r\n\r\nAnd if, in answer to this, you were to reply: \"Yes, it is so. Within\r\nthis little creature is a factory, that not only makes all you have\r\nmentioned, but much more. In this establishment, bones, hair, teeth,\r\nnails, flesh, blood, veins, nerves, skin, juices, and water are\r\nmanufactured; all this is made from milk, and during the first months of\r\nthe child's life from nothing but milk,\"--then your hearer, though he\r\nmay have the understanding of the most judicious of men, would be\r\ndumbfounded, and would beseech you to tell him more about this factory.\r\n\r\nYou may be certain, he would like to know, how many boilers, cylinders,\r\nvalves, wires, ladles, oars, pumps, hooks, pins, spokes, and knobs there\r\nmay be in this factory; more especially would he wish to know, whether\r\nthe engine of this wonderful establishment be made of steel, wood,\r\ncast-iron, silver or gold, or of diamonds.\r\n\r\nNow, if you were to tell him, \"It contains nothing of the kind. Of all\r\nthe factories you have seen in your life, there is none that bears any\r\nresemblance to this one. And I will tell you furthermore, that it is not\r\neven a complete factory, but it is continually developing; it becomes\r\nlarger and heavier like the child's body itself; moreover, the factory\r\ndoes not consist of iron or steel, nor of gold or diamonds, but it\r\nreproduces itself at every moment; it does so merely from the milk that\r\nthe child drinks,\"--then, to be sure, your hearer would begin to doubt\r\nhis own senses; he would exclaim: \"What is the intellect of the\r\nintelligent, the judgment of the judicious, what is the wisdom of the\r\nwise, when compared to a little of the mother's milk?\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, you are well aware, my friendly reader, that mother's milk is,\r\nafter all, nothing but milk; and that milk, again, is nothing but a\r\nmeans of nutrition; and nutrition, in its turn, is nothing but a part\r\nof the action of the human body.\r\n\r\nMay I hope that you will favor me with your attention, while, in a few\r\narticles, I speak to you about the nutrition of the human body?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMAN THE TRANSFORMED FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the process of nutrition in the human body, we must\r\nfirst obtain a correct idea of what is meant by nutrition.\r\n\r\nWhy are we obliged to eat?\r\n\r\nOf course we know that hunger forces us to do so. But every one is aware\r\nalso, that above all we must ask, whence hunger arises; that we must\r\nfirst get better acquainted with hunger itself, in order to understand\r\nnutrition.\r\n\r\nTo explain this, however, it is necessary to turn our attention to\r\nanother thing, no less a miracle than nutrition itself, viz., what in\r\nscientific language is called \"Exchange of Matter.\" To all of you it is\r\na well-known fact, that nothing in the human body remains even for a\r\nmoment in the same state; but that in every part of the body a continued\r\nexchange takes place. Air is breathed in and exhaled again; but the air\r\nexhaled is different from the air inhaled. By this process an exchange\r\nof matter has taken place; new matter has entered the body and waste\r\nmatter has been thrown out.\r\n\r\nThis exchange of matter--we shall speak more about it at another\r\nopportunity--is a principal necessity for the body and its functions; it\r\nconsists in the main of an incessant change, by which our body is forced\r\nto cast out matter that formed parts of it, and is therefore obliged, in\r\norder to compensate for the loss, to take in new matter. Hence there is\r\nno exaggeration in the expression, \"Man is continually renewing\r\nhimself;\" we indeed lose and receive particles of our body at every\r\nmoment. People have gone so far as to calculate that it takes seven\r\nyears for the renewal of the whole body of man, and that after this\r\nspace, there is not even an atom left of the man as he was seven years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe regular exchange of matter, as we have seen, supposes the body to be\r\na barter-place, where people take in at the same ratio they pay out.\r\nSince, however, man often pays out involuntarily and suffers so many\r\nlosses--by the mere process of breathing he ejects matter which he must\r\nreplace afterwards--this exchange of matter is the cause of the body's\r\npossessing the feeling of want. The body has paid out and receives\r\nnothing in return; this feeling of want is what we call \"Hunger.\" It\r\nforces us to absorb as much as we have paid out.\r\n\r\nNutrition, consequently, is the continual replacing of continual losses.\r\nIt is the wonderful transformation of food into the materials composing\r\nthe human body.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at our fellow-men, however, we must not think, that they\r\nare merely beings that have eaten food; but rather that they themselves,\r\nviz., their skin, hair, bones, brain, flesh, blood, nails, and teeth,\r\nare nothing but their own food, consumed and transformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWHAT STRANGE FOOD WE EAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan, according to what has preceded, is nothing but transformed food.\r\n\r\nThis idea may frighten us; it may be terrible to our hearts; but let us\r\nfrankly confess, it is a true one! Man consists only of such substances\r\nas he has consumed; he is, in fact, nothing but the food he has eaten;\r\nhe is food in the shape of a living being.\r\n\r\nA child is said to live on his mother's milk; but what else does this\r\nmean than: \"It is mother's milk, that has become alive by having been\r\nchanged into head, body, hands, feet, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, it may sound strange, yet it is quite correct: This mother's\r\nmilk in the shape of a human being consumes again new mother's milk,\r\nand, by respiration, by evaporation and secretion of matter, casts out\r\nthe used-up milk.\r\n\r\nThis being so, it will now appear evident to every one, that by a\r\nprofound chemical knowledge of our daily food, we may readily learn to\r\nknow the chemical components of man, and _vice versa_; knowing the\r\nsubstances of which man is made, it is easy for us to determine, what\r\nkind of food he must take, in order to continually renew his body.\r\n\r\nSince the mother's milk is the simplest and most natural food for the\r\nchild, let us consider it according to its importance. We shall then\r\nhave a stepping-stone towards the knowledge of the food of adults and\r\nits effects. The mother's milk contains all the elements, with which\r\nthe human body can renew itself; should there be but one of those\r\nelements wanting in it, the child would inevitably perish.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, milk did not contain calcareous earth, the consequence\r\nwould be, that the bones of the child would, soon after its birth,\r\nneither grow nor increase in number, but they would fast diminish, and\r\nthe child would die in consequence of this. The attempt was once made to\r\nfeed animals on articles without calcareous parts, when, strange to\r\nbehold, they all grew fat, but very weak in their bones, and finally\r\nbroke down.\r\n\r\nIf milk contained no phosphorus, not only would the bones and teeth\r\nsuffer from the want of it, but even the completion of the child's brain\r\ncould not properly take place, and the child could not replace the\r\nquantity of brain which it emits and loses every moment by breathing.\r\n\r\nIf there were no iron in the mother's milk, the child would die from the\r\ngreen-sickness, a malady which, by the way, is dangerous also for grown\r\npeople, and which is cured by medicines containing plenty of iron.\r\n\r\nIf there were no sulphur in it, the child's bile could not develop; the\r\nbile, as every one knows, has an important function in the human body.\r\n\r\nThese are but accessory elements of the mother's milk, elements which\r\nusually are not looked upon as articles of food; for who is aware that\r\nhe must eat, and actually does eat daily, phosphorus, iron, calcareous\r\nearth, and sulphur? And not only these; there are a great many other\r\narticles, such as magnesia, chlorine, and fluor, that we eat without\r\nbeing aware of it; moreover, our proper food consists also of three\r\ngases: nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen; and of a solid substance called\r\n\"carbon,\" which is no less and no more than pure coal.\r\n\r\nAll these, my friendly readers, are contained in milk--all these are the\r\nelements which in truth constitute the human body. Perhaps some persons\r\nbelieve that there is nothing easier than to procure proper food. It\r\nwould only be necessary to take a certain quantity of carbon, hydrogen,\r\noxygen, and nitrogen; a little bit of potassium, natron, calcium, and\r\nmagnesia; to mix a small piece of iron, sulphur, phosphorus, chlorine,\r\nand fluor, and take this mixture by the spoon at regular intervals, in\r\norder to give the body the necessary aliments. This, however, would be a\r\nmistake, for which the perpetrator would pay with his life.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is true that these substances form the proper and most\r\nimportant constituents of our daily food; yet, in order to enjoy the\r\ndesired result, we must not partake of them in their primary forms; they\r\ncan actually feed our body only when they are combined together in a\r\npeculiar, wondrous manner.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter it may be seen how nature first must combine these\r\nsubstances before they are presented to us as proper food; and it will\r\nalso be seen, that we receive them sometimes in altogether different\r\nforms and combinations; for example, in the mother's milk, when we eat\r\nthe above-named elements in the forms of caseine (cheese), butyrine\r\n(butter), sugar of milk, salt, and water.\r\n\r\nThese latter names have a more savory sound, have they not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHOW NATURE PREPARES OUR FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding article it was stated, that the food of the child which\r\nlives on mother's milk, consists in its primary elements of peculiar\r\nsubstances. These are principally oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen; three\r\ngases to which may be added a large quantity of carbon, or, what is the\r\nsame, coal. Besides this wondrous mixture of air and coal, the mother's\r\nmilk contains still other elements, but in a smaller proportion. In\r\nevery-day life many of them are unfamiliar; for example, natron,\r\ncalcium, magnesia, chlorine, and fluor; the others, however, are known\r\nto every one; viz., iron, sulphur, and phosphorus. All these strange\r\ningredients nature has carefully transformed into milk. For in their\r\nprimary state, and even in various chemical combinations that may be\r\nproduced artificially, they would be little adapted for the purpose. It\r\nis therefore essentially necessary that nature herself should make them\r\nready for us. This she does by letting them pass first into the\r\nvegetable state, and changing them afterwards into new forms.\r\n\r\nThe plant feeds on primary chemical elements; or, to state it more\r\ncorrectly, the plant is nothing but transformed primary elements! Not\r\nbefore the transformation of these elements into plants are the elements\r\nadapted for food for animals and men.\r\n\r\nMoreover, all that man eats must first have been in the vegetable state.\r\nNow, it is true that man also eats the flesh, fat, and eggs of animals;\r\nbut whence have the animals meat and eggs? Only from the plants they\r\nconsume.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable succession of transformations in nature. The\r\nprimary elements nourish the plant; the plant nourishes the animal; and\r\nboth, plant and animal, form the nourishment of man.\r\n\r\nEven the mother's milk, the simplest and most natural food of the child,\r\nowes its existence only to the fact that the mother has eaten vegetable\r\nand animal matter. This food, prepared for the mother by nature, has\r\nbeen changed into the body of the same; and partly, also, it has become\r\nthe milk destined to nourish the child.\r\n\r\nHence it is evident that mother's milk consists of oxygen, nitrogen,\r\nhydrogen, carbon, and a small portion of other chemical primary\r\nelements. But these substances when appearing in the shape of milk, are\r\ncombined in such a manner as to form ready-made food; as such they\r\nconstitute, as stated above, caseine, butyrine, sugar of milk, salt, and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe next questions are: \"What do these elements of food perform when in\r\nthe child's body? What becomes of these substances after they have been\r\neaten by the child? How are they changed during the time of their stay\r\nin the body? And in what condition do they leave the child's body, and\r\nhow do they force him to desire food again?\"\r\n\r\nThese questions properly belong to the chapter on \"Nutrition,\" where\r\nthey will be answered in their turn. Afterwards, we must be permitted to\r\nturn our attention to a further question, viz., \"What articles of food\r\nare the most advantageous to man from the time he is weaned or the time,\r\nhe takes from among vegetable and animal matter the same substances for\r\nfood, that are contained in the mother's milk?\"\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at the answers to all these questions, we were\r\nobliged to first prepare the ground a little. This was a gain on our\r\npart, for now we shall attain the end in a shorter time than would have\r\nbeen possible otherwise. We trust that we may give our reader a correct\r\nidea of the subject, if he will but come to our aid with his most\r\nearnest attention and reflection; these are needed here the more, as we\r\nhave to treat a difficult subject in a very short space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWHAT BECOMES OF THE MOTHER'S MILK AFTER IT HAS ENTERED THE BODY OF THE\r\nCHILD?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the child has freed itself from the body of its mother, it consists\r\nof blood, flesh, and bones, which heretofore were formed and nourished\r\nby the blood of the mother.\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as the child is born, it ceases to be nourished in\r\nthis manner. It ceases, also, to secrete through its mother, substances\r\nwhich are useless to it. The child now begins to breathe for itself, and\r\nby its breath secretes carbon in the form of carbonic acid. Its skin\r\nbegins to perspire, and secretes chiefly hydrogen and oxygen in the\r\nshape of water or vapor; by the urine, finally, it secretes nitrogen.\r\nThese substances--carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen--before their\r\nsecretion, constituted vital parts of the child's body; now, however,\r\nthey are wasted, and for this reason must be thrown off.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the child wants compensation for this loss. This is\r\ngiven by the mother's milk; for it contains chiefly these same\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nBut how is this effected?\r\n\r\nThe milk passes from the child's mouth through the gullet into the\r\nstomach. While yet in the mouth, the milk is mixed with a certain liquid\r\ncalled saliva. This saliva possesses the quality of preparing the milk\r\nfor the necessary change which will take place, when it reaches the\r\nchild's stomach. The principal work, however, is carried on in the\r\nstomach itself. Its sides secrete a liquid called \"gastric juice,\"\r\nwhose business it is, to transform into a pulp milk, and also solid\r\nfood, provided the latter be well masticated and moistened.\r\n\r\nScience has taught us to prepare gastric juice artificially. The process\r\nof digestion, that is, the transformation of solid food--the crust of\r\nbread, meat, etc.--into a pulp, may nowadays be observed in a glass\r\nfilled with warm, artificial, gastric juice.\r\n\r\nAfter the digestion is completed, the lower opening of the stomach,\r\nwhich leads into the duodenum, and which, during the process of\r\ndigestion, was closed by a muscle, opens itself. The pulp, now called\r\n\"chyme,\" flows into the continuation of the stomach--the \"alimentary\r\ncanal\" or \"duodenum.\" This is but a long bag with many folds and\r\nwindings.\r\n\r\nThe chyme is here mixed again with a liquid called \"intestinal juice;\"\r\nit has the quality of continuing digestion until the chyme separates\r\ninto two parts; one of them, a milky fluid called \"chyle,\" contains the\r\nsubstance which feeds the body. The other is the solid parts not adapted\r\nto nutrition; they are thrown out by the lower opening of the \"rectum.\"\r\n\r\nBut how is this nutritive part, the chyle, conveyed into the various\r\nparts of the body?\r\n\r\nThe intestinal canal is filled with extremely small vessels called\r\n\"lacteal absorbents.\" These vessels absorb the chyle. This absorption,\r\non account of the great length of the intestinal canal--in adults it is\r\nnearly thirty feet long--is, in a healthy body, accomplished very\r\nthoroughly. The real nutriment for the body is now contained in the\r\nlacteal absorbents, an infinite number of small tubes.\r\n\r\nAll these small vessels, however, converge towards the lower part of the\r\nspinal column, and uniting, form a vessel which ascends into the chest;\r\nhere it empties into a large blood-vessel, the blood of which is on its\r\nway to the heart. Thrown out of the heart in another direction, the\r\nblood is pushed through the whole body.\r\n\r\nThus the food, after having been transformed into a juice very similar\r\nto the blood, joins the blood after a circuitous journey, and is finally\r\nmixed with, or, more properly, changed into, blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHOW THE BLOOD BECOMES THE VITAL PART OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne would be well justified in calling the blood \"man's body in a liquid\r\nstate.\" For the blood is destined to become the living solid body of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nPeople were astonished, when Liebig, the great naturalist, called blood\r\nthe \"liquid flesh;\" we are correct even in going further and calling the\r\nblood \"man's body in a liquid state.\" From blood are prepared not only\r\nmuscles and flesh, but also bones, brain, fat, teeth, eyes, veins,\r\ncartilages, nerves, tendons, and even hair.\r\n\r\nIt is utterly wrong for anybody to suppose, that the constituents of all\r\nthese parts are dissolved in the blood, say as sugar is dissolved in\r\nwater. By no means. Water is something quite different from the sugar\r\ndissolved in it; while the blood is itself the material from which all\r\nthe solid parts of the body are formed.\r\n\r\nThe blood is received into the heart, and the heart, like a pump, forces\r\nit into the lungs. There it absorbs in a remarkable manner the oxygen of\r\nthe air which comes into the lungs by breathing. This blood, saturated\r\nnow with oxygen, is then recalled to another part of the heart by an\r\nexpansive movement of that organ.\r\n\r\nThis part of the heart contracts again and impels the oxygenated blood\r\ninto the whole body by means of arteries, which branch out more and\r\nmore, and become smaller and smaller, until at last they are no longer\r\nvisible to the naked eye. In this manner the blood penetrates all parts\r\nof the body, and returns to the heart by means of similar thread-like\r\nveins, which gradually join and form larger veins. Having reached the\r\nheart, it is again forced into the lungs, and absorbs there more oxygen,\r\nreturns to the heart, and is again circulated through the whole system.\r\n\r\nDuring this double circulation of the blood from the heart to the lungs\r\nand back, and then from the heart to all parts of the body and back\r\nagain--during all this, the change of particles, so remarkable in\r\nitself, is constantly going on: the exchange by which the useless and\r\nwasted matter are secreted and new substances distributed. This fact is\r\nwonderful, and its cause not yet fully explained by science; but so much\r\nis certain, that the blood when being conveyed to all parts of the human\r\nbody, deposits whatever at the time may be needed there for the renewal\r\nof that part.\r\n\r\nThus the blood that has been formed in the child from the mother's milk,\r\ncontains phosphorus, oxygen, and calcium. These substances, during the\r\ncirculation of the blood, are deposited in the bones, and form\r\n\"phosphate of lime,\" the principal element in the bone. In the same\r\nmanner fluor and calcium are given to the teeth. The muscles, or flesh,\r\nalso receive their ingredients from the blood; so do the nerves, veins,\r\nmembranes, brain, and nails; also the inner organs, such as the heart,\r\nlungs, liver, kidneys, intestines, and stomach.\r\n\r\nThey all, however, in return give to the blood their waste particles,\r\nwhich it carries to that part of the human body where they may be\r\nsecreted.\r\n\r\nIf any member of the body is so bound, that the blood cannot circulate,\r\nit must decay; for the life of the body consists in its constant change\r\nand transformation, in the continual exchange of fresh substances for\r\nwaste ones. But this vital exchange is only kept up by the constant\r\ncirculation of the blood, which, while it decreases by being\r\ntransformed into vital parts of the body, is always formed anew by our\r\ndaily food.\r\n\r\nFood is therefore very justly called \"Means of Existence,\" and the blood\r\nmay rightly be called the \"Juice of Life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCIRCULATION OF MATTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus we have seen that the human body is vital blood, transformed and\r\nsolidified. Now, blood is food transformed; food consists of primary\r\nelements prepared and changed by nature; hence, man himself is primary\r\nmatter transformed and vivified.\r\n\r\nBut the human race being thousands and thousands of years old, and there\r\nbeing upon the earth besides man the whole of the animal kingdom,\r\ndeveloping, preserving, and nourishing itself bodily like man; the\r\nquestion arises: Whence do they all come, these primary elements that\r\nare obliged forever to undergo transformation before they can become\r\nanimated vital matter? Do these primary elements not incessantly\r\ndecrease during the long process of their being changed into plants and\r\nconsumed by man and animal, in order to form human and animal bodies\r\nafterwards?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this interesting question has been given already. The\r\nhuman body is not framed or created anew at every moment by food; but it\r\nis at every moment, that small particles of the human body die. These\r\nparticles are returned to mother earth from which they sprang, thus\r\ngoing back to the primary elements.\r\n\r\nIt is not only those who are dead, that render to the earth what belongs\r\nto her, that return to nature what she gave them; but in a far greater\r\ndegree it is the living, that pay their debt to nature.\r\n\r\nMan's body is not his own; nature has lent it to him but for a short\r\nterm of service; then nature wrests her loan back from him. Thus must\r\nman, spite all his pride, accept her never-ceasing offer; daily he must\r\nborrow and daily he must repay in part, until the moment comes when he\r\nborrows for the last time, the moment he expires; and dying he leaves it\r\nto those around his bedside, to pay his last debt to earth.\r\n\r\nIs it not wonderful? His own blood is the messenger that daily carries\r\nnew loans to him, and, in the shape of transformed food, of transformed\r\nelements of nature, equips his body. But his own blood is at the same\r\ntime also his cashier, who, having rendered him service, takes the loan\r\naway, by secreting from the body elements that are thus returned to\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWith every revolution of the blood the body is supplied with transformed\r\nfood, which is immediately changed into vital parts of the body; with\r\nevery return of the blood waste matter is carried off and deposited,\r\nwhere it may be thrown out.\r\n\r\nThe blood carries waste matter to the kidneys that they may send out of\r\nthe body, in the shape of urine, waste nitrogen, mixed with a part of\r\nthe phosphate of lime, that served to form bones and teeth, but is now\r\nuseless. The blood, besides, secretes perspiration through the skin.\r\nThis is a liquid containing water, hence oxygen and hydrogen; but is\r\nmoreover mixed with various other waste substances of the body, as for\r\nexample, carbonic acid, nitrogen and fat. Chiefly, however, the blood is\r\nemployed in carrying waste carbon to the lungs, so that they may, by the\r\nprocess of respiration, exhale carbonic acid, a gas which would prove of\r\ndeadly effect if remaining in the lungs too long, or if inhaled.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of man's secretion per day is by no means small. It amounts\r\nto the fourteenth part of his own weight: nay, more--the weight of his\r\nperspiration alone, secreted partly by evaporation in the shape of gas,\r\npartly as a liquid in drops, amounts during twenty-four hours to nearly\r\ntwo pounds.\r\n\r\nSecreted substances have lost all the qualities of transformed and vital\r\nmatter. They return to the primary elements and serve as food\r\nprincipally to plants, which before had offered those very same\r\nsubstances as food to man.\r\n\r\nIt is in this manner that the great circulation of matter in nature\r\ntakes place. From the lifeless primary elements to the plant; from the\r\nplant, in the shape of food, to animal and man; from these, as waste\r\nsubstances, back again to the primary elements, there to begin anew a\r\ncirculation, by means of which inanimate elements are reanimated, and\r\nvital elements made lifeless again; that is, life changed again into\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nAnd it is in this circulation that our \"Nutrition,\" or, more precisely,\r\nthe \"Change of Matter in Man,\" consists, an important link in the\r\nlife-preserving chain of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it must appear evident that only such dishes\r\nmake good food as contain the same constituents as the blood.\r\n\r\nTo have these constituents, food must contain salt, fat, and sugar; all\r\nthese ingredients must, of course, be in a certain proportion.\r\n\r\nThat water is essential for the support and renewal of the body is clear\r\nto every one. The flesh we eat, contains nearly eighty per cent. of\r\nwater, and yet a man must die, if he were to eat nothing but meat and to\r\nhave no water, for the reason that the eighty per cent. of water he\r\ntakes in would by no means be sufficient to form all the liquids\r\nnecessary for the human body.\r\n\r\nThe albumen that we eat, forms in the blood chiefly the substances\r\ncomposing the muscular part of the flesh. But it is an error to suppose,\r\nthat therefore it is absolutely necessary to eat eggs--the white of an\r\negg is nearly pure albumen--because the caseine (cheese) contains\r\nprecisely the same ingredients as the albumen; for we have seen before,\r\nand our readers are doubtless aware of it, that the mother's milk\r\ncontains caseine, while it is entirely free of albumen. Hence, he who\r\neats plenty of caseine, as do shepherds in Switzerland, for example,\r\nscarcely needs any meat. But besides caseine there is another element,\r\nviz., the vegetable albumen called gluten, which contains albuminous\r\nmatter; so do all glutinous plants. Peas, beans, and lentils in\r\nparticular form food productive of flesh.\r\n\r\nThe salts that must be given to the blood, do not only consist in the\r\ncommon kitchen-salt. By the expression \"Salts\" are meant various\r\ncombinations of substances which are usually not considered articles of\r\nfood, for example, the combinations of phosphorus, iron, etc., but are\r\nnot visible to the eye. They help to form bones, teeth, nails,\r\ncartilages, and hair.\r\n\r\nThe fat which we take, appears to many people to be a very important\r\npart of our food, and they believe that by eating much fat, one may\r\nbecome fat. But this is not correct. Ferocious animals that live only on\r\nmeat and fat, do not get fat; while herbivorous animals fatten\r\nexcessively, if provided with good mast, consisting of course but of\r\nplants. Yet fat is, for all this, by no means superfluous to our body.\r\nMan needs it, because it is the fat which chiefly supports his\r\nrespiration. But the fat that is needed for the body, is formed by man\r\nhimself; so that but little of it need be eaten, and that little only\r\nfor the purpose of helping to form new fat from sugar.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore best to consider fat and sugar as food belonging\r\ntogether; for the fat is formed in the body from sugar, and the small\r\nquantity of fat which we take daily is only to promote the\r\ntransformation of sugar into fat.\r\n\r\nBut let no one believe that one must needs actually eat sugar; no, every\r\nfood that contains starch supplies the place of sugar very well, as\r\nstarch is changed, when in the body, first to sugar and then to fat. The\r\npotato contains starch and serves its purpose well; it is necessary,\r\nhowever, to put butter with it in order that the starch and sugar formed\r\nfrom the potato in the stomach, may be easily converted into fat.\r\n\r\nAn excellent article of food is bread, for it contains nearly all the\r\nelements of nutrition. It contains vegetable albumen, and therefore is\r\nconverted into flesh. It has nearly all the salts that are essential to\r\nthe body; moreover, it contains starch from which fat is produced.\r\nTherefore, by the mere addition of a little butter in order to make the\r\nformation of fat easier, and by drinking water besides, the human body\r\nis able to exist. On the other hand, the potato, if taken alone, is an\r\ninsufficient means of nutrition. Neither would meat or albumen, if taken\r\nalone, be able to preserve life.\r\n\r\nVarious experiments have been tried with animals, and a great deal of\r\ninformation about the best means of feeding the body has been collected.\r\nIn order to investigate the effect of the nutritive qualities of food,\r\ninquiries have been made especially at military establishments, such as\r\nbarracks, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nABOUT NOURISHMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the demands of modern science, numerous experiments\r\nabout nutrition have been made, in regard to digestion as well as to the\r\neffects of hunger and of various elements of food.\r\n\r\nAs to digestion, the most excellent observations were made on men\r\nafflicted with a fistula in the abdomen, that is, a wound penetrating to\r\nthe stomach. By means of this wound, it was ascertained very minutely\r\nhow long it took to digest food, and what kind of transformation it\r\nunderwent. From this and other experiments it appeared, that the time\r\nfor digestion, though varying greatly with the various articles of food,\r\nlasts from one and one-half to five and one-half hours. Those most\r\nquickly digested are: soft sweet apples, beaten eggs, and cooked brain.\r\nTo digest boiled milk, raw eggs, soft sour apples, roasted beef, liver,\r\ntwo hours were required. Cooked spinal marrow, raw cabbage, fresh milk,\r\nroasted beef, oysters, soft-boiled eggs, and raw ham, took nearly three\r\nhours. Wheat bread, old cheese, potatoes were digested in nearly three\r\nand one-half hours; pork, boiled cabbage, lamb's fat, not before five\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe experiments about the effects produced by hunger were tried only on\r\nanimals. The results were that during the state of starvation\r\nthree-fourths of the blood disappeared; the fat was almost entirely\r\nconsumed; the flesh disappeared one-half; even the skin diminished\r\none-third, and the bones lost about one-sixth of their weight. The\r\nleast decrease was found to be in the nerves, a striking proof that\r\nnerves possess a great power of self-preservation, provided there be but\r\na minimum of matter to feed them. From numerous experiments the\r\nconclusion was drawn, that an adult weighing about one hundred and\r\nthirty pounds must die if he were to lose, say fifty pounds, by\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the effects of the various articles of food, experiments\r\napplied to dogs have shown that they can live on bones for a long time;\r\nbut that they die if fed on sugar only, and when examined after death,\r\nno trace of any fat is to be found.\r\n\r\nAnimals fed on substances that contained no phosphorus and lime became\r\nfat; but they died for want of the proper nourishment for their bones.\r\nAnimals died also when nourished only with pure albumen or pure caseine.\r\nThe most remarkable fact in this connection is, that they perished in\r\nthe same length of time in which they would have died, _if they had\r\ntaken no food whatever_.\r\n\r\nExperiments tried on man have shown that it is injurious to eat\r\n_uniform_ food. A constant change in our food is extremely nourishing\r\nand healthy. This is an experience made in prisons and barracks; changes\r\nof food are made there every day during the week, so that each day they\r\nhave a different dinner. Once, a physician in England wished to try the\r\neffects of uniform food on himself. He took nothing but bread and water\r\nfor forty-five days; in consequence of this he decreased eight pounds.\r\nThen he ate for four weeks but bread and sugar, then bread and oil three\r\nweeks; but finally he succumbed under his experiments, and died, after\r\nhaving experimented thus for eight months.\r\n\r\nWe must not, therefore, call it daintiness when we feel an appetite for\r\nmore variety of food, or if we soon get tired of uniform meals: a\r\nconstant change in this respect is necessary. Experiments have shown\r\nthat rabbits continue their health, if alternately they receive one day\r\npotatoes, the next day barley; but if they receive exclusively potatoes\r\nor barley, they soon die.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we will mention a few articles of food and their\r\nqualities. Among grains, wheat is known to be the most nutritive, and\r\nwheat bread and meat taken together is always good, wholesome food. Rice\r\nproduces fat, but if taken by itself, it is not worth much, since it is\r\nnourishing only if eaten with butter, or fat, and a little meat. Potato\r\nis a cheap, and yet an expensive food; for it contains very little\r\nnutriment. In order to be of benefit it must be eaten in great quantity;\r\nbesides, it is necessary to season it with salt, butter, or fat, as\r\notherwise it would be totally useless. A good diet is peas, beans, and\r\nlentils; but their hulls are indigestible, and must be removed.\r\n\r\nIn general, beverages are not counted among articles of food; and\r\nkitchen-salt is commonly believed to be but a matter of taste; but this\r\nis a great mistake. Coffee and tea, too, are nourishing in their way;\r\ngood beer is equal to half a dinner, and as to salt, a frequent relish\r\nof the same is an excellent means of nutrition.\r\n\r\nCheap coffee, cheap beer, and cheap salt are therefore a great benefit\r\nto the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nLIGHT AND DISTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSOMETHING ABOUT ILLUMINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time to time we hear of plans to illuminate whole cities by a great\r\nlight from a single point. The credulity of the newspaper public about\r\naffairs belonging to Physics is so great, that we are not surprised if\r\nsuch plans are spoken of as practicable; though, indeed, one needs but\r\ncast a glance of reflection on them, to be at once convinced of their\r\nimpracticability.\r\n\r\nThe impracticability does not consist so much in this, that no such\r\nintense light can be made artificially, as in the circumstance that the\r\nilluminating power of light decreases enormously as we recede from it.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain this to our readers, let us suppose that on some\r\nhigh point in New York city, say Trinity-church steeple, an intensely\r\nbrilliant light be placed, as bright as can be produced by gases or\r\nelectricity. We shall see, presently, how the remoter streets in New\r\nYork would be illuminated.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clearness, let us imagine for a moment, that at a\r\nsquare's distance from Trinity church there is a street, intersecting\r\nBroadway at right angles. We will call it \"A\" street. At a square's\r\ndistance from \"A\" street let us imagine another street running parallel\r\nto it, which we will call \"B\" street; and again, at a square's distance,\r\na street parallel to \"B\" street, called \"C\" street; thus let us imagine\r\nseven streets in all--from \"A\" to \"G\"--running parallel, each at a\r\nsquare's distance from the other, and intersecting Broadway at right\r\nangles. Besides this, let us suppose there is a street called \"X\"\r\nstreet, running parallel with Broadway and at a square's distance from\r\nit; then we shall have seven squares, which are to be illuminated by one\r\ngreat light.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that light decreases in intensity the further we recede\r\nfrom it; but this intensity decreases in a peculiar proportion. In order\r\nto understand this proportion we must pause a moment, for it is\r\nsomething not easily comprehended. We hope, however, to present it in\r\nsuch a shape, that the attentive reader will find no difficulty in\r\ngrasping a great law of nature, which, moreover, is of the greatest\r\nmoment for a multitude of cases.\r\n\r\nPhysics teach us, by calculation and experiments, the following:\r\n\r\nIf a light illuminates a certain space, its intensity at twice the\r\ndistance is not twice as feeble, but two times two, equal four times, as\r\nfeeble. At three times the distance it does not shine three times as\r\nfeeble, but three times three, that is nine times. In scientific\r\nlanguage this is expressed thus: \"The intensity of light decreases in\r\nthe ratio of the square of the distance from its source.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now try to apply this to our example.\r\n\r\nWe will take it for granted that the great light on Trinity steeple\r\nshines so bright, that one is just able to read these pages at a\r\nsquare's distance, viz., on \"A\" street.\r\n\r\nOn \"B\" street it will be much darker than on \"A\" street; it will be\r\nprecisely four times darker, because \"B\" street is twice the distance\r\nfrom Trinity church, and 2 x 2 = 4. Hence, if we wish to read this on\r\n\"B\" street, our letters must cover four times the space they do now.\r\n\r\n\"C\" street is three times as far from the light as \"A\" street; hence it\r\nwill be nine times darker there, for 3 x 3 = 9. This page in order to be\r\nreadable there, would then have to cover nine times the space it\r\noccupies now.\r\n\r\nThe next street, being four times as remote from the light as \"A\"\r\nstreet, our letters, according to the rule given above, would have to\r\ncover sixteen times the present space, for it is sixteen times darker\r\nthere than on \"A\" street.\r\n\r\n\"E\" street, which lies at five times the distance from the light, will\r\nbe twenty-five times darker, for 5 x 5 = 25. \"F\" street, which is six\r\ntimes the distance, we shall find thirty-six times darker; and, lastly,\r\n\"G\" street, seven times the distance from the light, will be forty-nine\r\ntimes darker than \"A\" street, because 7 x 7 = 49. The letters of a piece\r\nof writing, in order to be legible there, must cover forty-nine times\r\nthe surface that our letters cover now.\r\n\r\nBut the reader will exclaim: \"This evil can be remedied. We need but\r\nplace forty-nine lights on Trinity steeple; there will then be\r\nsufficient light on \"G\" street for any newspaper to be read.\" Our friend\r\nwill easily perceive, however, that it is more judicious to distribute\r\nforty-nine lights in different places on Broadway, than to put them all\r\non one spot.\r\n\r\nThis is sufficient to convince any one that we may be able to illuminate\r\nlarge public places with _one_ light, but not the streets of a city, and\r\nstill less whole cities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nILLUMINATION OF THE PLANETS BY THE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was demonstrated above, that it is impossible to illuminate large\r\ndistances by a single light. Yet we must acknowledge that nature herself\r\ndoes this, and that the sun is the only light which shines throughout\r\nthe solar system; for the light which is seen in the planets is but\r\nlight received and reflected from the sun.\r\n\r\nThis is sufficient reason for us to believe, that there are not on every\r\nplanet creatures as we see them on our earth; but that, on the contrary,\r\neach celestial body may be inhabited by creatures organized according to\r\nthe distance of the planet from the sun; that is, adapted to the degree\r\nof light produced there by the sun.\r\n\r\nFor the natural sciences teach us, that solar light is subject to the\r\nsame laws as our artificial light: it decreases as the distance\r\nincreases. The planets more remote from the sun are illuminated less\r\nthan those nearer to it. The ratio in which this light decreases, is\r\nprecisely the same as that of the terrestrial light illustrated above,\r\nviz., according to the square of the distance. In other words, when the\r\ndistance is double, the intensity of the light is one-fourth as great;\r\nwhen three times, one-ninth as great; when four times more remote,\r\none-sixteenth as strong, etc.; in short, at every distance as much\r\nweaker as the distance multiplied by itself.\r\n\r\nPresently we shall see that the planets are illuminated in inverse\r\nproportion to their distance from the sun. From this alone we come to\r\nthe conclusion, that on every planet the living beings must necessarily\r\nbe differently constituted.\r\n\r\nThe name of the planet nearest to the sun is Mercury. It is about two\r\nand a half times nearer to the sun than our earth, therefore it receives\r\nnearly seven times as much light. We can scarcely conceive such an\r\nintensity of light and all the consequences resulting from it. If\r\ninstead of one sun we should happen to have three, there is no doubt\r\nthat we should go blind; but seven suns, that is, seven times the light\r\nof our brightest days, we could not endure, even if our eyes were\r\nclosed; the more so, as our eyelids, even when firmly closed, do not\r\nprotect us from the sun's light entirely. This is a proof of our\r\nassertion, that the living beings on the planet Mercury must be\r\ndifferently organized from us.\r\n\r\nVenus, the third planet, is one and a third times nearer to the sun than\r\nwe are. The light on that planet, therefore, is nearly twice as bright\r\nas on ours. But inasmuch as even this would be unbearable for us, the\r\ncreatures on this planet must likewise be different from us.\r\n\r\nThe third planet is the earth we inhabit. The intensity of the sunlight\r\nin bright summer days is well known to us from experience, although no\r\none has as yet been successful in measuring its degree as precisely as\r\nhas been done with heat by the thermometer. It is true that in modern\r\ntimes a certain Mr. Schell, in Berlin, proposed to measure light\r\naccurately, in a way that elicited the approbation of naturalists,\r\nespecially of Alexander von Humboldt. However, the experiments proposed\r\nhave not yet been properly carried out, though they are very useful to\r\nphotographists. Therefore we do not know, up to the present time,\r\nwhether there is any difference in the light of two cloudless summer\r\ndays; just as little are we able to determine how much the moon's light\r\nis weaker than the sun's.\r\n\r\nThe fourth planet's name is Mars; its distance from the sun is one and\r\na half times our distance from the sun. There the sun's light is about\r\nhalf as strong as with us. Now, although we often may have days which\r\nare half as bright as others, it is yet very doubtful whether we could\r\nlive on Mars; for light does not act upon our eyes only, but on our\r\nwhole body and its health. It is likely that the very want of light\r\nthere would prove fatal to us.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-four newly discovered planets have days that are nearly six\r\ntimes darker than ours. The daylight on these planets is probably as it\r\nwas with us during the great eclipse of the sun in July, 1851. This\r\nlight was very interesting for a few minutes, but if it were to continue\r\nit would certainly make us melancholy.\r\n\r\nFar worse yet fare the remoter planets. On the planet Jupiter it is as\r\nmuch as thirty times darker than with us. On Saturn, eighty times. On\r\nUranus, even three hundred times; and upon the last of the planets,\r\nNeptune, discovered in 1845, light is nine hundred times more feeble\r\nthan upon our globe.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is true that all of the remoter planets have many moons or\r\nsatellites, yet it must not be forgotten that the moons themselves are\r\nbut very feebly illuminated; that their light benefits during the night\r\nonly, and even then only lovers and night revellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nTHE WONDERS OF ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA WONDERFUL DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people are greatly surprised, that when a new planet is\r\ndiscovered--and within late years this has been frequently the\r\ncase--astronomers should be able to determine a few days afterwards its\r\ndistance from the sun, together with the number of years necessary for\r\nits orbit. \"How is it possible,\" they ask, \"to survey a new guest after\r\nsuch a short acquaintance so accurately, as to foretell his path, nay,\r\neven the time of his course?\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless it is true that this can be done, and certainly no\r\nstage-coach nor locomotive can announce the hour and minute of its\r\narrival with as much accuracy as the astronomer can foretell the arrival\r\nof a celestial body, though he may have observed it but a short time.\r\n\r\nMore yet is done sometimes. In 1846, a naturalist in Paris, Leverrier by\r\nname, found out, without looking in the sky, without making observations\r\nwith the telescope, simply by dint of calculation, that there must exist\r\na planet at a distance from us of 2,862 millions of miles; that this\r\nplanet takes 60,238 days and 11 hours to move round the sun; that it is\r\n24 1/2 heavier than our earth, and that it must be found at a given time\r\nat a given place in the sky; provided, of course, the quality of the\r\ntelescope be such as to enable it to be seen.\r\n\r\nLeverrier communicated all this to the Academy of Sciences in Paris. The\r\nAcademy did not by any means say, \"The man is insane; how can he know\r\nwhat is going on 2,862 millions of miles from us; he does not even know\r\nwhat kind of weather we shall have to-morrow!\" Neither did they say,\r\n\"This man wishes to sport with us, for he maintains things that no one\r\ncan prove to be false!\" Nor, \"The man is a swindler, for he very likely\r\nhas seen the planet accidentally, and pretends now that he discovered it\r\nby his learning.\" No, nothing of the kind; on the contrary, his\r\ncommunication was received with the proper regard for its importance;\r\nLeverrier was well known as a great naturalist.\r\n\r\nHaving thus learned how he made the discovery, the members of the\r\nAcademy felt convinced that there were good reasons to believe his\r\nassertions to be true.\r\n\r\nComplete success crowned his efforts.\r\n\r\nHe made the announcement to the Academy in January, 1846; on the 31st of\r\nAugust he sent in further reports about the planet, which he had not\r\nseen as yet. The surprise and astonishment on the part of scientific men\r\ncan scarcely be imagined, while on the part of the uneducated there were\r\nbut smiles and incredulity.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of September, Mr. Galle--now Director of the Breslau\r\nObservatory, at that time Assistant in that of Berlin, a gentleman who\r\nhad distinguished himself before by successful observations and\r\ndiscoveries, received a letter from Leverrier, requesting him to watch\r\nfor the new planet at a place designated in the heavens. Though other\r\ncities at that time possessed better telescopes than Berlin, this city\r\nwas chosen because of its favorable situation for observations.\r\n\r\nThat same evening Galle directed his telescope to that spot in the sky\r\nindicated by Leverrier, and, at an exceedingly small distance from it,\r\nactually discovered the planet.\r\n\r\nThis discovery of Leverrier is very justly called the greatest triumph\r\nthat ever crowned a scientific inquiry. Indeed, nothing of the kind had\r\never transpired before; our century may well be proud of it. But, my\r\nfriendly reader, he who lives in this age without having any idea\r\nwhatever of the way in which such discoveries are made--he does not\r\ndeserve to be called a contemporary of this age.\r\n\r\nWe will not try to make an astronomer out of you; we merely wish to\r\nexplain to you the miracle of this discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMAIN SUPPORT OF LEVERRIER'S DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Leverrier was working at his great discovery he did not strike out\r\na new path in science; he was supported by a great law of nature, the\r\nbase of all astronomical knowledge. It is the law of gravitation,\r\ndiscovered by Sir Isaac Newton.\r\n\r\nThose of our readers who have fully understood what we said before (page\r\n50) about light, will now easily comprehend, what we are going to say\r\nabout the force of gravity.\r\n\r\nEvery heavenly body is endowed with the power of attraction; that is, it\r\nattracts every other body in the same manner that a magnet attracts\r\niron. If the celestial bodies, or, to speak only of one class, if all\r\nthe planets were at rest, that is, without motion, they would, on\r\naccount of the great attractive power of the sun, rapidly approach it,\r\nand finally unite with it and form one body.\r\n\r\nThat this does not take place, may be ascribed solely to the fact that\r\nall planets have their own motion. This motion, combined with the\r\nattractive force of the sun, causes them to move in circles around it.\r\n\r\nThis may be illustrated by the following: Suppose a strong magnet to lie\r\nin the centre of a table. Now, suppose some one to place an iron ball on\r\nthe table; then will this ball run straightway towards the magnet. But\r\nif some one were to roll the ball so that it should pass the magnet, it\r\nwould at first run in a straight line, but the magnet attracting it at\r\nevery moment of time, the ball would be compelled to deviate from its\r\nstraight course and would begin to circulate round the magnet.\r\n\r\nWe see that this circular motion round the magnet springs from two\r\nforces: first, from the hand that starts the ball in a straight line;\r\nand secondly, from the attraction of the magnet, which at every moment\r\ndraws the ball towards itself.\r\n\r\nNewton, the greatest natural philosopher of all times, who lived in\r\nEngland two hundred years ago, proved, that all the orbits round the\r\nsun, as described by the planets, are caused by two such forces; by the\r\nmotion of the planets peculiar to themselves, which, if not interfered\r\nwith, would make them fly through space in a straight line; and by the\r\nattractive force of the sun, which is continually disturbing that\r\nstraight course, thus forcing the planets to move in circles around him.\r\n\r\nBut Newton has discovered more than this. He succeeded in proving that,\r\nknowing the time of a planet's revolution around the sun, we can\r\ndetermine precisely with what force the attractive power of the sun\r\naffects it. For if the sun's attractive power is strong, the planet will\r\nrevolve very quickly; if weak, it will move slowly.\r\n\r\nWere the sun, for example, all of a sudden to lose a portion of his\r\nattractive force, the consequence would be that the earth must revolve\r\naround him more slowly. Our year, which now has three hundred and\r\nsixty-five days, would then have a much greater number of days.\r\n\r\nNewton has also shown--and this is for us the main thing--that the\r\nattractive force of the sun is strong in his close proximity, but that\r\nit diminishes as the distance from him increases. In other words, the\r\nremoter planets are attracted by the sun with less force than those\r\nnearer to him. The attractive force decreases with the distance in the\r\nsame proportion as light, which, we saw a little while ago, decreases in\r\nintensity as the square of the distance increases. This means, that a\r\nplanet at a distance from the sun twice as great as that of the earth,\r\nis attracted with only one-fourth the force; one that is three times the\r\ndistance, with one-ninth of the force, etc.\r\n\r\nThis great law pervades all nature. It is the basis of the science of\r\nastronomy, and was the main support of Leverrier's discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the question presents itself to the thinking reader: If it be\r\ntrue that the heavenly bodies attract each other, why do not the planets\r\nattract one another in such a manner that they will run round and about\r\neach other?\r\n\r\nNewton himself proposed this question; he also found the answer. The\r\nattractive power of a celestial body depends upon its larger or smaller\r\nmass. In our solar system the sun's mass is so much larger than that of\r\nany of the planets, that the balance of attractive power is largely in\r\nhis favor; hence the revolving of the planets around him. If the sun\r\nwere to disappear suddenly the effect of the attractive influence of the\r\nplanets upon one another would be tremendous. There can be no doubt that\r\nthey would all begin to revolve around Jupiter, because that planet has\r\nthe largest mass. To give some examples in figures,--the sun's mass is\r\n355,499 heavier, while Jupiter's is but 339 times heavier than that of\r\nthe earth. It is evident that, the sun's mass being more than a thousand\r\ntimes larger than Jupiter's, so long as the sun exists the earth will\r\nnever revolve around Jupiter.\r\n\r\nYet Jupiter is not without influence upon the earth; and though it is\r\nnot able to draw it out of its course round the sun, yet it attracts the\r\nearth to some extent. Observations and computations have shown us, that\r\nthe earth's orbit around the sun, owing to the attraction of Jupiter, is\r\nsomewhat changed, or, as it is called, \"disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nAs with Jupiter and the earth, so with all the other planets; their\r\nmutual attraction disturb their orbits round the sun. In reality, every\r\nplanet revolves in an orbit which, without this \"disturbance,\" would be\r\na different one. The computation of these disturbances constitutes a\r\ngreat difficulty in astronomy, and requires the keenest and most\r\nenergetic studies ever made in science.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of our readers may ask here, whether in course of time\r\nthese disturbances will become so great as to throw our whole solar\r\nsystem into confusion? Well, the same question was proposed by a great\r\nmathematician named Laplace, who lived towards the end of the last\r\ncentury. But he himself answered the question in an immortal work, \"The\r\nMechanics of the Heavens.\" He furnished the proof, that all disturbances\r\nlast but a certain time; and that the solar system is constructed so\r\nthat the very attractions by which the disturbances are caused, produce\r\nat the end of certain periods a regulation or rectification; so that in\r\nthe end there is always complete order.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been said, it is evident that if one of the planets were\r\ninvisible, its presence would still be known to our naturalists, on\r\naccount of the disturbances it would cause in the orbits of the other\r\nplanets; unless, perhaps, its mass be so insignificant as to render its\r\npower of attraction imperceptible.\r\n\r\nAnd now we may proceed to explain the subject of this chapter.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1846, when Leverrier made his great discovery, it was\r\nbelieved that Uranus was the most distant planet revolving around the\r\nsun. Uranus itself was discovered by Sir John Herschel in England in the\r\nyear 1781. As this planet takes eighty-four years to go round the sun,\r\nits complete revolution had not yet been observed in 1846; in spite of\r\nthis, however, the course of Uranus was calculated and known very\r\nprecisely, because the attractive force of the sun was known; and all\r\nthe disturbances that might influence the planet were taken into\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all nicety of calculations, the real course of\r\nUranus would not at all agree with the one computed. At that time\r\nalready, long before Leverrier's discovery, the idea arose that beyond\r\nUranus, in a region where the human eye could, in spite of all\r\ntelescopes, discover nothing, there must probably exist a planet which\r\nchanged the course of Uranus. Bessel, a great astronomer, who\r\nunfortunately for science died too soon, was already on the point of\r\nfinding out by computation the unknown disturber. But he died, shortly\r\nbefore Leverrier's discovery. As early even as 1840, Maedler, in the\r\ncity of Dorpat, in Russia, wrote a fine article on this as yet unseen\r\ndisturber.\r\n\r\nLeverrier, however, began the task and finished it. He computed with an\r\nacuteness that was admired by all men of science. He investigated\r\nwhereabout in the heavens that intruder must be situated, so as to be\r\nable to trouble Uranus to such an extent; how fast this disturber itself\r\nmust move in its orbit, and how large must be its mass.\r\n\r\nWe live to see the triumph of Leverrier's being able to discover with\r\nhis _mental_ eye, by means of computation only, a planet at a distance\r\nof millions of miles from him.\r\n\r\nTherefore let us say: Honor science! Honor the men that cultivate it!\r\nAnd all honor to the human intellect which sees farther than the human\r\neye!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI.\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSOMETHING ABOUT THE WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe presume that in a state of unusual bad weather there are many\r\npersons, who find occasion to reflect on the nature of weather in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, we had \"green Christmas and white Easter,\" and spring\r\nwas of course far behind when Pentecost arrived. We had still cold and\r\nrainy days, while the nights were frosty; and, if one might judge from\r\nappearances, it seemed that nature had made a mistake, and had not known\r\nof our being then in the month of June, which, with us, is usually a\r\ndelightful month.\r\n\r\nThe sun alone was right. He rose on the 9th of June of that year\r\nprecisely at 4 o'clock 30 minutes, as was prescribed to him by the\r\ncalendar; and set at 7 o'clock 30 minutes, precisely according to\r\norders. At that time the sun was hastening towards summer, he lengthened\r\nthe days and shortened the nights; but he alone is not capable of\r\ngoverning the weather, and our friends the astronomers, although they\r\nare able to calculate the sun's course with more precision than the\r\nengineer can the locomotive's, are themselves greatly embarrassed when\r\nasked, \"What kind of weather shall we have the day after to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\nIt is unpardonable that some of our almanacs, especially those for the\r\nfarmer, contain prophecies about the weather. We cannot be too indignant\r\nagainst the foolish superstition which this abuse tends to foster. And\r\nwhat is worse, really shameful, is, that those who print such things do\r\nnot believe in them themselves, but consider them a necessity\r\nsanctioned by age and custom, and offer it as such to the credulity of\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this article on the knowledge of weather, is a science, a\r\ngreat branch of the natural sciences; but it is a branch just\r\ndeveloping, and therefore has, up to the present time, not yet brought\r\nforth any fruit.\r\n\r\nIt is very likely that at some future day we shall be able to indicate\r\nin advance the weather of any given place. But for the present this is\r\nimpossible; and if from time to time men arise and announce that they\r\ncan calculate and determine in advance the state of the weather in any\r\ngiven place--pretending to consult the planets, etc.--we take it for\r\ngranted that they are as unreliable as the weather-prophets of the\r\nalmanacs.\r\n\r\nWe said above that the weather might possibly be determined a few days\r\nahead; science is at present almost far enough advanced for it. But\r\nthere are needed for that purpose grand institutions, which must first\r\nbe called into life.\r\n\r\nIf for the proper observation of the weather, stations were erected\r\nthroughout the extent of our country, at a distance of about seventy\r\nmiles from each other, and if these stations were connected by a\r\ntelegraph-wire, managed by a scientific reliable observer; then we\r\nmight, in the middle portion of our country, be able to determine in\r\nadvance the state of the weather, though for a short time only.\r\n\r\nFor the changeableness of the weather depends on the nature and motion\r\nof the air, and on the amount of moisture, and the direction of the\r\nwinds. It is mostly occasioned by currents of air which pass over the\r\nearth, producing, wherever they meet, here cold, there heat--here rain,\r\nthere hail or snow.\r\n\r\nAlong a part of the coast of the United States electric telegraphs have\r\nbeen established. Vessels receive, at a considerable distance, the news\r\nof a storm approaching, together with its velocity and direction. The\r\nelectric telegraph being quicker than the wind, the vessels receive the\r\nnews in time to take their directions. Before the storm reaches them,\r\nthey have been enabled to take precautionary measures for its reception.\r\n\r\nThis is a great step forward in our new science. But not before the time\r\nwhen such stations shall be established everywhere throughout the land,\r\nwill meteorology manifest its real importance. For it has, like every\r\nother science, firmly established rules, which can easily be calculated\r\nand verified; while, on the other hand, allowances must be made for\r\nchangeable conditions which tend to disturb the rules.\r\n\r\nWe will now endeavor to introduce to our readers these established\r\nrules, and explain the changeable conditions to which we refer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOF THE WEATHER IN SUMMER AND WINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have stated above, there exist fixed rules about the weather;\r\nthese rules are simple and easy to compute. But our computations are\r\noften disturbed by a great many circumstances beyond our reach, so much\r\nthat we are governed more by exceptions than rules.\r\n\r\nThese latter are based on the position of our earth with regard to the\r\nsun. They are, therefore, easy to determine, for astronomy is a science\r\nresting on firm pillars; and although nothing in the universe is so far\r\nfrom us as the stars, yet there is nothing in the world so certain as\r\nour knowledge of the courses of the constellations and their distances.\r\nMany of our readers may be surprised, perhaps, to hear that we know more\r\naccurately the distance from the earth to the sun than the distance from\r\nNew York to Cincinnati. Indeed, astronomical knowledge is the most\r\nreliable in the world. No merchant is able to measure a piece of cloth\r\nwithout being mistaken, to say the least, as much as 1/300 part; while\r\nthe uncertainty with respect to distances of bodies in the solar system\r\namounts to a great deal less than 1/300 part.\r\n\r\nOur earth turns on its axis once in every twenty-four hours, and goes\r\nalso round the sun once a year. But the earth's axis is inclined towards\r\nthe earth's orbit--orbit is the circle which a celestial body describes\r\nin its revolution around another--in such a manner as to cause the\r\nearth, in its orbit round the sun, to be illuminated for six months on\r\none side, and for six months on the other side of the earth. Hence it\r\nhappens, that at the north pole there is continual day during six months\r\nin the year, after which follows uninterrupted winter for the next six\r\nmonths; in the same way the day on the south pole lasts six months, and\r\nthe night following the same length of time. In the middle between both\r\npoles, however, in the regions around the equator, the day has\r\nthroughout the year twelve hours; the night, of course, the same; while\r\nin the countries between the equator and the poles, the length of day\r\nand night is, through the whole year, constantly varying.\r\n\r\nWe, in the United States, inhabit the northern hemisphere; when,\r\ntherefore, the time comes that the north pole has day for six months, we\r\nin North America, being situated about half-way between the equator and\r\nnorth pole, enjoy long days and short nights. The inhabitants of those\r\ncountries, however, situated on the southern hemisphere, have at that\r\ntime short days and long nights. But when the time comes that there is\r\nsix months' night on the north pole and six months' day on the south\r\npole, then will the inhabitants of the southern hemisphere have long\r\ndays, and we long nights.\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with the length of day and night are our seasons,\r\nespecially summer and winter; for together with the sun's light heat is\r\nalso called forth. During our long days, therefore, it is very warm with\r\nus, for the sun's rays heat the soil. During our short days we\r\nexperience cold, because the warming light of the sun does not reach our\r\nearth directly. For this reason the northern hemisphere enjoys summer\r\nwhile the southern has winter; and _vice versa_, when we have\r\nmid-winter, people in the other hemisphere are in the midst of summer.\r\nWhen we are snowed up at Christmas, and seek joy and elevation by the\r\ncheerful fireside in the brightly-lighted room, we may, perhaps, think\r\nof our friends and relatives who have emigrated to Australia, and the\r\nquestion may occur to us, how things may be with them this cold\r\nweather, and how they are enjoying the holidays?\r\n\r\nNow, would not the uninformed be surprised, if a letter were to arrive\r\nfrom Australia, written at Christmas, telling how the writer enjoyed\r\nChristmas in his vine-arbor, where he had sought shelter from the\r\nterrible heat of the day, and that he had but late at night gone to his\r\nroom, and he could scarcely sleep then on account of the heat, and the\r\nlonging for his former home in the United States, where he could always\r\nenjoy cool weather at Christmas.\r\n\r\nThe uninformed will now learn that Australia lies in the southern\r\nhemisphere, while we are in the northern, and that there they live in\r\nmidst of summer, while we are buried in snow. Nor will he now be\r\nsurprised when he reads, that it snowed in Australia in the month of\r\nAugust, and that his friend or relative there reposed by the fireside,\r\nand read the letter from home by the light of the lamp, at the same hour\r\nthat we here were taking an afternoon walk in the summer shade.\r\n\r\nThe heat of summer, however, does not altogether depend upon the length\r\nof the day; nor does the cold of winter upon its shortness; but\r\nprincipally on this, that during summer-time the sun at noon stands\r\ndirectly over head; that therefore his vertical rays are enabled to\r\npierce the soil with intense heat; while in winter-time the sun at noon\r\nstands nearer to the horizon; his rays fall on the earth obliquely,\r\ntherefore heating the soil with but feeble power.\r\n\r\nWe shall presently see that this position of the sun exercises great\r\ninfluence upon the weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE CURRENTS OF AIR AND THE WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to fully understand the conditions of the atmosphere, one must\r\ncarefully notice the following:\r\n\r\nThough the sun produces summer and winter, and although his beams call\r\nforth heat, and the absence of heat causes intense cold on the surface\r\nof the globe, yet the sun alone does not make what we call \"Weather.\"\r\n\r\nIf the sun's influence alone were prevalent, there would be no change at\r\nall during our seasons; once cold or warm, it would invariably continue\r\nto be so, according to the time of the year. The sun, however, produces\r\ncertain movements in the air; currents of air or winds pour from cold\r\ncountries into warm ones, and _vice versa_ from warm ones into cold\r\nones. It is this that makes our sky be cloudy or clear; that produces\r\nrain and sunshine, snow and hail, refreshing coolness in summer and\r\nwarmth sometimes in midwinter, as also chilly nights in summer and thaw\r\nin winter. In other words, it is more properly the motion of the air,\r\nthe wind, that produces what we call _weather_; that is, that\r\nchangeableness from heat to cold, from dryness to moisture, all of which\r\nmay be comprised in one name, weather.\r\n\r\nBut whence does the wind arise? It is caused by the influence of the\r\nsun's heat upon the air.\r\n\r\nThe whole earth is enveloped with a misty cover called \"air.\" This air\r\nhas the peculiar quality of expanding when it becomes heated. If you put\r\na bladder that is filled with air and tied up, into the pipe of a heated\r\nstove, the air inside will expand so much as to burst the bladder with\r\na loud report. The warm expanded air is lighter than the cold air, and\r\nalways ascends in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nLofty rooms are therefore difficult to heat because the warm air ascends\r\ntowards the ceiling. In every room it is much cooler near the floor than\r\nnear the top of the room. This accounts for the singular fact that in\r\nwinter our feet, though warmly clad in stockings and shoes or boots,\r\nfeel cold more often than our hands, which are entirely uncovered. If\r\nyou ascend a ladder in a tolerably cold room, you are surprised at\r\nfinding it much warmer above than below in the room. The flies take\r\nadvantage of this in autumn, when they are seen to promenade on the\r\nceiling, because there it is warm as in summer, while near the floor it\r\nis cold; owing to the circumstance that warm air, being lighter than\r\ncold, ascends.\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same takes place on the earth. In the hot zone near the\r\nequator the sun heats the air continually; hence the air there ascends.\r\nBut from both the northern and southern hemispheres, cold air is\r\nconstantly pouring towards the equator in order to fill the vacuum thus\r\nproduced. This cold air is now heated also and rises, while other cold\r\nair rushes in after. By this continued motion of the air towards the\r\nequator, however, a vacuum is created also at both poles of the earth;\r\nand the heated air of the equator, after having ascended, flows towards\r\nthese two vacuums. Thus arise the currents in the air; currents which\r\ncontinue the whole year, and cause the cold air to move from the poles\r\nto the equator along the surface of the earth; while higher in the\r\natmosphere the heated air flows from the equator back to the poles.\r\n\r\nTherefore the air is said to circulate below from the poles to the\r\nequator, but above to go back from the equator to the poles.\r\n\r\nHe who is in the habit of noticing phenomena of nature, may often have\r\nobserved something of the kind when opening the window of a room filled\r\nwith smoke. The smoke escapes above, while below it seems to come back\r\ninto the room again.\r\n\r\nBut this is an illusion which has its origin in the fact, that above the\r\nwarm air of the room goes out of the window, and, of course, takes the\r\nsmoke with it; below at the window, however, cold air pours in from\r\nwithout, driving the smoke that is below back into the room. The\r\nattentive observer may also see how the two currents of air above and\r\nbelow move in contrary directions; while in the middle part they repel\r\neach other, and form a kind of eddy which may be clearly perceived by\r\nthe motion of the smoke.\r\n\r\nWhat takes place on our earth is nothing different from this, and we\r\nshall presently see the great influence this has upon our weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRM RULES OF METEOROLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe air which is continually rising in the hot zones and circulating\r\ntowards the poles and back again to the equator, is the prime source of\r\nthe wind. This latter modifies the temperature of the atmosphere; for\r\nthe cold air from the poles of the earth, in coming to the equator,\r\ncools the torrid zone; again, the hot air going from there to the poles\r\nheats the colder regions. This accounts for the fact that very often it\r\nis not so cold in cold countries as it really would be, were it not for\r\nthis circulation of the air; and that in hot countries we never find the\r\ndegree of heat that there would be if the air were continually at rest.\r\n\r\nAccording to what has been said, however, but two different winds would\r\nexist on the earth, and these two moving in fixed directions; one\r\nsweeping over the earth from the poles to the equator, with us called\r\n\"North wind,\" and one from the equator to the icy regions, with us the\r\n\"South wind.\"\r\n\r\nBut we must add here something which considerably modifies this, viz.,\r\nthe revolution of the globe. The earth, it is well known, revolves round\r\nits axis from west to east once in twenty-four hours; the atmosphere\r\nperforms this revolution also.\r\n\r\nBut since that part of the atmosphere nearest to the equator must move\r\nwith greater velocity than the part nearer the poles, it may with a\r\nlittle thinking be easily understood, that the air which goes on the\r\nsurface of the earth from the poles to the equator, passes over ground\r\nwhich moves faster east than the air itself; while, on the contrary,\r\nthe air coming from the hot zone starts in an eastern direction with the\r\nvelocity it had on the equator; but, as it is moving on, it passes\r\nover that part of the earth which rotates with less velocity.\r\n\r\nThis gives rise to what are called the _trade-winds_, so very important\r\nto navigation. In our hemisphere the trade-winds come in the lower\r\nstrata of the air from the northeast; while in the upper strata they\r\nmove towards northeast, they come from the southwest. On the other\r\nhemisphere the trade-winds in the lower strata of the air move in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction; in the upper they move in a southeasterly\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nFrom this arise our rules respecting the weather.\r\n\r\nThe idea that many persons have that wind and weather are two things\r\nentirely different, is wrong. Weather is nothing else but a condition of\r\nthe atmosphere. A cold winter, cold spring, cold summer, and cold\r\nautumn, do not mean, as some believe, that the earth, or that part of it\r\non which they live, is colder than usual; for if we dig a hole in the\r\nground, it will be found that neither cold nor warm weather has any\r\ninfluence upon the temperature below the surface of the earth. At the\r\nsmall depth of thirty inches below the surface, no difference can be\r\nfound between the heat of the day and the cold of the night. In a well\r\nsixty feet deep no difference is perceivable between the hottest summer\r\nand the coldest winter-day, for below the surface of the earth the\r\ndifferences of temperature do not exist. What we call Weather is but a\r\nstate of the atmosphere, and depends solely upon the wind.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated already that there are fixed rules of weather, or,\r\nwhich is the same thing, that there are laws governing the motion of the\r\nwinds; but we have added also, that there are a great many causes which\r\ndisturb these rules, and therefore make any calculations in advance a\r\nsheer impossibility.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that these rules are called forth, 1st, by the course of\r\nthe sun; 2d, by the circulation of the air from the poles to the equator\r\nand back again; and 3d, by the revolution of the earth, causing the\r\ntrade-winds.\r\n\r\nAll these various items have been calculated correctly; and, owing to\r\nthis, we have now a firm basis in meteorology. But in the next article,\r\nwe shall see what obstacles are put in the way of this new science by\r\nother things; and the allowances to be made for these disturbances\r\ncannot be easily computed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAIR AND WATER IN THEIR RELATIONS TO WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the causes which disturb the regular currents of air,\r\nand which render the otherwise computable winds incomputable, thus\r\nproducing the great irregularities of the weather.\r\n\r\nThe main cause lies in this, that neither the air nor the earth is\r\neverywhere in the same condition.\r\n\r\nEvery housewife that but once in her life hung up clothes to dry, knows\r\nfull well that air absorbs moisture when passing over, or through, wet\r\nobjects. If she wishes to dry her clothes very quickly, she will hang\r\nthem up where there is much wind. And she is perfectly right in\r\nmaintaining that the wind dries clothes better than the quiet sunshine.\r\n\r\nWhence does this come?\r\n\r\nFrom this: dry air, when coming in contact with wet objects, absorbs the\r\nmoisture, and by this dries the object somewhat. If there be no wind,\r\nthe moistened air will remain around the wet object, and the drying goes\r\non very slowly. But so soon as a little wind arises, the moist air is\r\nmoved away, new dry air constantly takes its place, and coming into\r\ncontact with the wet article, effects in a very short time the desired\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nHence, it is not heat alone that causes the clothes to dry; for in\r\nwinter-time, though it is so cold that the clothes on the line freeze to\r\nstiffness, they dry nevertheless, if it be very windy. It is the wind\r\nwhich dries them by allowing fresh air to pass through them continually.\r\nFor the same reason our housewives open doors and windows after a room\r\nhas been scoured, so that by a thorough draft of air, the floor may dry\r\nquickly; a large fire in the stove or fireplace could not effect it so\r\nreadily.\r\n\r\nFrom all this we may learn that the air absorbs particles of water. It\r\nwill now be evident to every one, why water in a tumbler, standing\r\nuncovered at the open window for a few days, constantly decreases, until\r\nit finally disappears entirely and the tumbler is dry. Where has the\r\nwater gone? The air drank it off, little by little, until at last the\r\ntumbler was emptied.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" you will exclaim, \"what does the air do with all the water it\r\ndrinks? The air goes over the whole ocean; over lakes, rivers, brooks,\r\nand springs; over woods and fields, and everywhere it takes in particles\r\nof water. What becomes of them?\"\r\n\r\nAfter being absorbed, the particles of water unite and form clouds; then\r\nthey fall down in the form of fog, rain, snow, or hail.\r\n\r\nMany persons, even highly educated ones, have false ideas about these\r\nphenomena of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSome think a cloud is a kind of bag that contains the rain which is let\r\nfall by the cloud. This is entirely false. The clouds are nothing but\r\nfogs in the upper regions of the atmosphere; fog itself is nothing but a\r\ncloud immediately over ground.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to obtain a correct idea of the formation of fog and rain;\r\none need but observe for one's self.\r\n\r\nHe who has ever blown upon his hands in winter-time in order to warm\r\nthem, will have observed that his hands become moist from his breath. If\r\na window-pane is breathed upon, it is covered by a thin coat of water.\r\nWhat is the cause of this? It arises from the fact that the air we\r\nexhale contains water-particles from our blood. We do not see them when\r\nit is warm, because they are airy themselves; everybody knows that they\r\nbecome visible so soon as the air turns cool; or that they appear like\r\nfog when one is in a cold room in winter; that they form drops when you\r\nbreathe upon cold objects; that they freeze and become snow; nay, that\r\nin severe cold weather, after a long walk outdoors, they even cling to\r\none's moustache like icicles.\r\n\r\nThis may illustrate, that these particles of water are invisible in the\r\nwarm air, but that when the air is colder they appear as fog; when still\r\ncolder, as drops of rain; and in very cold weather they turn to snow,\r\nwhile in severe cold they freeze and form ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFOG, CLOUDS, RAIN, AND SNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe air imbibes particles of water from all parts of the earth; and thus\r\ncharged with water it is the same and operates the same as our breath.\r\n\r\nSo soon as a stratum of air that contains water-particles, meets with a\r\ncolder stratum, these airy particles of water immediately flow together\r\nto form fog. But fog, as has been said, is nothing but a cloud. He who\r\nhas travelled in mountainous countries, has often noticed this. From the\r\nvalley it often appears that the top of a high mountain is wrapped in\r\nclouds; and his curiosity may be excited to ascend the mountain in order\r\nto examine these clouds. But when he arrives there, he sees nothing\r\nwhatever either before or behind him but fog, which most assuredly he\r\nhas often seen before without so much trouble. The ignorant person who\r\nbelieves that a cloud is something else than fog, and who fancies that\r\nthe clouds which he saw from below have disappeared during his ascent,\r\nleaving but a mist behind, will be no little amazed when he has arrived\r\nat the foot of the mountain again, to see the cloud above as before, and\r\nto perceive that he actually walked among the clouds.\r\n\r\nHence it is understood now, that the particles of water in the air form\r\nfog, or, which is the same, clouds, so soon as they come into a colder\r\nstratum. But the cloud is not rain as yet; the change into rain will\r\ndepend upon circumstances that may be easily guessed. If a warmer and\r\ndryer stratum passes over the one containing the newly formed clouds,\r\nthen this warmer stratum will absorb the water-particles of the other.\r\nThe moist air fares like the wet clothes we spoke of; the warm dry air\r\nabsorbs its particles of water. But if a colder stratum of air\r\napproaches the stratum containing clouds, then the water-particles of\r\nthe latter are condensed; the cloud becomes small drops of water; these\r\ndrops are too heavy to be supported in the air, and they fall down as\r\n_rain_.\r\n\r\nDuring its descent, the drop of rain is steadily increased by the\r\nwater-particles of the air through which it passes. Thus it happens,\r\nthat rain often arrives at the earth in the form of large drops of\r\nwater, while when yet in the air and beginning to fall, it consisted of\r\ntiny drops. It is well known that the rain-drops on the roof are smaller\r\nthan those that fall on the street. The difference is so great, that on\r\nthe roof of the royal castle in Berlin, Prussia, there falls four and a\r\nhalf inches less rain during the year than on the square before the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nOur readers may now imagine, without difficulty, how in a similar way,\r\nsnow is formed. If a stratum of air saturated with moisture meets a very\r\ncold one, the fog begins to freeze, and becomes specks of snow. They,\r\ntoo, increase while falling, and on arriving upon the earth they are\r\nlarge flakes.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a lecture about the formation of snow in the\r\natmosphere, Professor Dove once told an anecdote, which is as\r\ninteresting as it is instructive. A musician in St. Petersburg gave a\r\nconcert in a large hall, where the fashionable world had assembled in\r\ngreat numbers. It was an icy cold night, such as is almost unknown with\r\nus; but in the overcrowded hall there was such excessive heat as only\r\nRussians can endure. Soon, however, it became too intense even for them.\r\nThe hall was densely crowded; the throng was alarming; several ladies\r\nfainted. An effort was made to open a window, but without success--the\r\nwindow was frozen fast. A gallant officer devised means; he broke the\r\nwindow in. And what happened? _It commenced to snow in the concert\r\nroom!_ How did this come? The vapor exhaled by the multitude of persons\r\nin the hall had collected above, where the air was hottest. The sudden\r\nentrance of the icy air through the broken window changed the particles\r\nof water into snow. Thus it was this time not heaven, but the upper\r\nspace of an unventilated concert-hall, that sent down snow.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way hail is formed in the atmosphere; this we shall\r\nconsider at more length hereafter. At present we must turn our attention\r\nto the influence of these phenomena upon cold and heat; for it is a\r\nknown fact, that rain and evaporation are not only engendered by cold\r\nand heat, but, _vice versa_, that rain and evaporation, in their turn,\r\nengender cold and heat in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nHOW HEAT IN THE AIR BECOMES LATENT, AND HOW IT GETS FREE AGAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter it was shown how warm air produces evaporation,\r\nand how cold air causes rain and snow. In this chapter we desire to\r\ndemonstrate how the reverse may take place, viz., the engendering of\r\ncold and heat by evaporation and rain.\r\n\r\nAlthough what we wish to prove in the following is firmly established,\r\nyet it is not easy to make it understood. For this reason many educated\r\nmen, who have read much about \"free and latent heat,\" have mistaken\r\nideas about it.\r\n\r\nIn order that what we shall explain may be in the reach of every one, we\r\nmust again choose our examples from life itself, and request our readers\r\nto come to our aid with their thoughts.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows how water is boiled. It is placed over the fire, the\r\nheat of which communicates itself to the water and heats it more and\r\nmore. Now, where does the heat of the fire go? It is taken up by the\r\nwater; thus to speak, the water absorbs the heat. This explains why a\r\ncooking-stove on which a dinner is cooked, does not get near as warm as\r\nit would, if the same quantity of fuel had been used without any cooking\r\non the stove. For a portion of the heat being absorbed by the meat, it\r\ncannot heat the stove; hence the stove fails to receive the amount of\r\nheat that is used in cooking the meat.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the effect of taking boiling water from the stove and\r\nplacing it in the room somewhere? Where will the heat of the water go\r\nthen?\r\n\r\nWe all know that in this case the water cools down by degrees. The water\r\ngives out its heat. Now, it is evident that while on the fire, the water\r\nhad absorbed heat; and that it gave out that heat on being put in a\r\ncolder place.\r\n\r\nBut what will become of the water if it is allowed to continue to absorb\r\nheat? What becomes of a pot of water, if, on beginning to boil, it is\r\nnot taken off the fire? Does such water continue to absorb heat?\r\n\r\nObservation shows that this is not the case. Put a thermometer into\r\nboiling water; it will immediately rise to 212 degrees; let it remain\r\nthere ever so long, it will not rise a degree higher. But during that\r\ntime there was a brisk fire; it is evident, therefore, that heat was\r\ncontinually passing into the water. Where, then, is this heat? It has\r\nnot remained in the water, or else the thermometer would have continued\r\nto rise. It must be, then, that it has passed away with the burning hot\r\nsteam which has been constantly rising and floating about in the room.\r\nMoreover, it is well known that water, when allowed to continue to boil,\r\ndecreases in quantity. Our housewives call this \"_boiling down_.\" In\r\ntruth, however, the water boils _up_; for, if you notice carefully, a\r\npart of the water, while boiling, is changed into steam, which may be\r\nseen rising from the pot and ascending in the air. The question\r\nnaturally arises now, where is the heat that the boiling water has been\r\ncontinually absorbing? It has not remained in the water, or the\r\nthermometer would have continued to rise. The answer is now evident: the\r\nheat has risen with the steam, and with it floats about in the air; or,\r\nin other words, the heat has been absorbed by the steam; or, which is\r\nthe same, the heat has become latent in the steam. Therefore we are\r\ncorrect in saying, _it takes heat to change water into steam_. We know\r\nnow where the heat has gone; it has become latent in the steam.\r\n\r\nThe next question might be: Can this latent heat become free again?\r\nCertainly it can; and many a good housewife has convinced herself of it\r\nvery often, though perhaps she did not philosophize about it. When\r\ntouching unawares the spout of the tea-kettle with her hand she felt as\r\nthough her hand was wet, and scalded besides. Whence did this come? The\r\nhand was wetted by the steam, which, on coming in contact with the hand,\r\nchanged to water again, but in the same moment, also, the steam gave up\r\nits heat to the hand by scalding it. Steam, therefore, when changing\r\ninto water, gives its latent heat up again; or, the latent heat becomes\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon, which may be witnessed in every kitchen, happens in\r\nnature on a larger scale; by what powerful effects it is accompanied, we\r\npropose to show in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLATENT HEAT PRODUCES COLD; FREE HEAT, WARMTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who considers how water when heated is transformed into steam, and\r\nhow this steam has absorbed the whole portion of heat that was necessary\r\nto form it, will easily understand, that places where vapor is formed\r\nmust become cooler. Just as the fire used for cooking purposes cannot\r\nheat the stove, so that portion of the sun's heat which changes the\r\nwater on the surface of the earth into vapor, cannot heat the earth.\r\nHence it follows, that wherever water evaporates, the air _turns cool_,\r\nbecause the heat, instead of being imparted to the air, is used in\r\nforming vapor; this vapor, then, contains the same portion of heat that\r\nwas necessary to form it; or, scientifically speaking, vapor makes heat\r\nlatent.\r\n\r\nWhen in summer it is oppressively hot, and a heavy shower comes, it is\r\noften more oppressive during the rain than before; but _after_ the rain\r\nthe weather is, as we call it, _cooled off_.\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of this? After the rain the surface of the earth is\r\nwet, and the moisture begins to evaporate. In other words, the\r\nrain-water changes again into vapor. To do this, heat is necessary, and\r\nis withdrawn from the air and from the surface of the earth; by this\r\nmeans air and earth become _cool_.\r\n\r\nIt is very agreeable during the summer-time to have the streets of\r\ncities sprinkled with water, and it is also very healthy, because the\r\nevaporation of the sprinkled water renders heat latent, and thus cools\r\noff the air.\r\n\r\nThe reverse, however, may also take place. As the housewife's hand is\r\nscalded when the steam changes on her hand into water, that is, as the\r\nsteam by turning into water again gives up the heat it possessed, just\r\nso acts nature. When vapor in the air turns into rain, it gives up that\r\nportion of heat which it had held latent, and hence it is, that\r\n_before_ a rain or snow-storm the weather turns warmer.\r\n\r\nWhen in winter it suddenly turns a little warm, that is, when the cold\r\nsuddenly diminishes, we know that it is going to snow. The only reason\r\nwhy it has become warm is this, that in the air above, vapor has changed\r\ninto snow, thus giving up its heat, the benefit of which we feel. Thus\r\nin summer-time, when the sun becomes fiercest, people say \"The sun draws\r\nwater, it will rain.\" The truth is, that the vapors in the air change\r\ninto water, and thus give up their heat; people now think the sun has\r\nbecome hotter.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of this phenomenon is the fact, that in countries\r\nwhere there is much water, the air in summer is much cooler, because a\r\ngreat deal of water evaporates there, by which means heat is absorbed or\r\nmade latent. In winter the air in such countries is warmer, because much\r\nvapor is changed into water; thus heat becomes free.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that all this has a great influence upon the weather--an\r\ninfluence that may be calculated even in advance.\r\n\r\nTo state an example: The positions of Berlin and London are such, that\r\nthe summer-heat and the winter-cold ought to be equal in both places.\r\nBut because England is an island in the ocean, that is, surrounded by\r\nlarge masses of water, the evaporation of water is in London much\r\ngreater; hence the summer there is cooler. For the same reason rain and\r\nfog are much more frequent there, and the winter, consequently, is less\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this work we shall see how similar conditions have very\r\ngreat influence upon whole countries, and therefore often cause,\r\ncontrary to the rule, cold summers and warm winters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nRULES ABOUT THE WEATHER, AND DISTURBANCES OF THE SAME.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we cast a glance upon the phenomena of our atmosphere, we find that\r\nthey are indeed computable, and that the weather in general may be\r\nforetold, even for large countries, with some degree of certainty. Nay,\r\nthere are countries where the weather is not variable at all, but\r\nchanges at regular periods and according to fixed rules.\r\n\r\nIn countries near the equator, where the sun's heat is very strong,\r\nheat, calm, and dryness prevail during the summer-time. This state of\r\nthe atmosphere continues uninterruptedly until winter; nor can there be\r\nany frost there in winter, because even then the sun's rays fall with\r\nbut little obliquity upon the surface of the earth. But inasmuch as the\r\nsun no longer heats the earth to the same degree, the air ceases to\r\nretain the same amount of heat, and as a great deal of cold air is\r\nconstantly passing in from the poles, the vapor spoken of above is, at\r\nthat season of the year, changed back into water. Thus, winter there is\r\nmerely a long, uninterrupted rainy season.\r\n\r\nWe see that for the warmer countries the rules of temperature are pretty\r\nconstant and sure; there one is not surprised by irregularities of\r\nweather such as occur with us. Summer brings heat, calm, and dryness;\r\nwinter, east winds, thunder-storms, and continual rain. The rain once\r\nceasing, the sun reappears in a few days, and everything begins to bloom\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThis holds good only for the countries near the equator. The further\r\nyou go towards the poles, the more varied become summer and winter, the\r\nlength of day and night, heat and cold, and consequently, also, the\r\ncondition of the atmosphere and of the weather proper.\r\n\r\nA glance upon the map will convince any one, that it is with us that the\r\nweather is most changeable. The reasons for this may now be more closely\r\nexamined. Our country lies nearly half way between the pole and the\r\nequator. From our pole we constantly receive a cold wind, the north\r\nwind. And above, in the atmosphere, a warm wind, the south wind, goes\r\ncontinually from the equator to the pole. Through the rotation of the\r\nearth around its axis from west to east, the north wind becomes an\r\neasterly, that is, a northeast wind; and the south wind in the upper\r\natmosphere becomes a westerly, or southwest wind. The former, coming\r\nfrom cold countries, carries no vapor with it; hence, during northeast\r\nwind we have clear sky, or sunshine, but without heat. If this wind\r\noccurs in winter, it brings us dry frost; in daytime the sun shines\r\nsplendidly, at night the stars sparkle brilliantly; yet our breath\r\nfreezes on our lips. The same wind when prevailing in the first days of\r\nspring, causes us, in spite of the glaring sun, to feel considerably\r\ncold in the shade.\r\n\r\nAnd it is but natural that it should be so.\r\n\r\nThe wind comes from the north; there ice and snow are just melting, and\r\nthe sun's heat being employed for this \"melting business,\" the air\r\ncannot receive much of it.\r\n\r\nThis kind of weather would be regular with us; but, as we know already,\r\nthe heated upper air flows from the equator to the north pole; now we\r\nlive in the very region where this upper air, in its descent towards the\r\npoles, at times touches the surface of the earth, thus causing warm\r\ncurrents of air, which occasionally are followed by cold ones.\r\n\r\nNear the equator the cold current of air moves below and the warm one\r\nabove; while in our regions, both currents meet near the surface of the\r\nearth, struggle with each other, seek to repel one another, rush and\r\nroll in all directions over the land, and bring us such varieties of\r\nweather as will exasperate all weather prophets, and greatly increase\r\nthe difficulty of scientific solutions in meteorology.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we shall endeavor to prove that this state of\r\naffairs, together with the situation of our country, are the main causes\r\nof the changeableness of our weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGEABLENESS OF THE WEATHER WITH REGARD TO OUR GEOGRAPHICAL\r\nPOSITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have endeavored to explain why our weather is so uncertain and\r\nincomputable. As we have seen, it has its origin in this, that in our\r\nregions the warmer equatorial currents of air no longer move _above_ the\r\ncolder ones, but that they descend here, and pursue their northern\r\ncourse alongside and opposing the colder currents. This often gives rise\r\nto a struggle between cold and warm currents. In summer we witness such\r\ncombats very frequently. The sky is at first bright; the sun sends down\r\nhis most powerful rays; in the shade we are refreshed by a strong\r\ndraught, which keeps the sky clear, and free from clouds. Suddenly there\r\ncomes a calm. Even in the shade the heat now becomes intolerable. The\r\ntrees stand immovable; no leaflet stirs. The complete calm becomes\r\nunendurable, and causes anxiety. \"Always a calm before a storm,\" say the\r\npeople, and hasten to seek shelter in their houses--and well! for it is\r\nnot long before a counter wind commences to blow. The weathercock turns\r\nround, the dust in the streets is whirled up in eddies, and here and\r\nthere rises in clouds to the house-tops. Suddenly clouds are seen to\r\nform themselves; the trees shake their crowns; the leaves rustle, and\r\nbefore one is aware of it, we have storm, thunder, and violent rain,\r\nwhich cool off the earth.\r\n\r\nWhence came this weather; more especially, whence came the calm\r\npreceding it, and the whirlwind following?\r\n\r\nThere were two opposite currents of air, which for a time avoided each\r\nother, but at length met over our heads. Each current at first pressed\r\non the other with equal force, so that they mutually were brought to a\r\nstand-still; this we called a _calm_. But such an equilibrium does not\r\nlast long, for one current must in the end overcome the other; they\r\nwhirl through one another, raise the dust in high columns, seize the\r\ntrees and give them a thorough shaking. The cold current changes the\r\nvapor of the warm current into clouds, then into rain. The pouring down\r\nrain immediately sets free the heat. At this stage electrical phenomena\r\nare witnessed, such as lightnings, claps of thunder, and concussions of\r\nthe air. And this continues until one current of air has carried the\r\nvictory over the other; not till then does the weather become quiet\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBesides these opposing currents of air, which come from the north and\r\nsouth, there are other causes disturbing our weather, viz., the\r\ngeographical position of our country in regard to the east and west.\r\n\r\nA glance on the map reminds us that our continent borders, on the east\r\nand west, on that immense waste of water, the ocean. We know now that\r\nthe air above the water is always saturated with vapors, while the air\r\nover the land is comparatively dry. And moist air contains heat, dry air\r\ndoes not; both, however, are continually tending towards equilibrium and\r\nwish to exchange temperatures from each other. As our dry air is\r\nsurrounded on both sides by moist air, it is evident that we must more\r\nor less partake of both heat and cold; but it moreover accounts for the\r\nhappy circumstance that we have much rain; hence our soil is well\r\nwatered, and this is a blessing to any country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE DIFFICULTY AND POSSIBILITY OF DETERMINING THE WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now explained the rules referring to the conditions of our\r\nweather, and proved that owing to the geographical position of our\r\ncountry, to determine the weather in advance, is difficult, we wish to\r\nexamine this difficulty a little more closely in pointing out the wrong\r\ndirection which has hitherto been pursued in the science of meteorology.\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty in predicting the weather for any given place\r\nconsists in this, that a change in the atmosphere need not originate in\r\nthe place where it occurs. Thus, to-morrow's weather in New York is not\r\na consequence of the condition of the air as it exists there to-day; for\r\nthe air is continually moving, and, owing to many disturbances, is\r\ncarried over city and country. We have no sure means of ascertaining\r\nwhence the wind will come to us to-morrow. All we know is, that from all\r\nsides currents of air are moving simultaneously; from the north pole a\r\ncold current, from the equator a warm one, from the ocean one saturated\r\nwith moisture. All these winds are in continual commotion, and have the\r\ncharacteristics of the neighborhood from which they come. If from the\r\nstate of the weather in New York to-day it were desired to predict the\r\nweather there for to morrow, one ought to be able to overlook a space of\r\nabout a thousand miles around; in other words, it must first be\r\nascertained what is the state of the atmosphere within about a thousand\r\nmiles of the city. Besides, there should be known the direction of all\r\nthe winds within this wide space, and their speed, and whether they\r\ncontain much moisture or little. Not without this information could a\r\ncalculation be made about the velocity with which a change of the\r\nweather would take place in New York; what results the meeting of two or\r\nmore currents of air might call forth; and what kind of weather this\r\nmight produce there.\r\n\r\nWeather, therefore, for the present state of meteorology, is but a\r\nsubject of investigation into the existing condition of existing\r\nphenomena, and not a subject of prediction of coming phenomena. It is\r\ntrue, there are general rules by which a proximate success in predicting\r\nmay be obtained. If winter begins mild, or, better, if southwest winds\r\nand rain prevail till the middle of January, it is very likely that this\r\nwill be counterbalanced by a northeast wind in the latter part of the\r\nwinter. The saying, therefore, is correct, \"green Christmas and white\r\nEaster;\" but this rule is by no means infallible, the counteraction may\r\nbe accelerated by violent storms, or greatly retarded by mild currents\r\nof air.\r\n\r\nNot before the time that meteorological stations are established\r\nthroughout the land, and connected by electric telegraphs--a project\r\nwhich to us may seem immense, but to our children will appear very\r\nsimple and natural--not before that time will a city like New York, for\r\nexample, receive timely information about the conditions of the currents\r\nof air at all the stations. At each of these places the force of the\r\ncurrent, its warmth, moisture, and weight will be accurately ascertained\r\nby instruments. Then, and then only, we may calculate what currents will\r\nmeet and where, and what effects the meeting will have. If this be done\r\non Saturday, the Sunday papers will be enabled to state precisely\r\nwhether the church-goers must provide themselves with umbrellas or\r\nparasols.\r\n\r\nBut not for Sunday alone will this be of importance. It will be long\r\nafter their establishment, that such weather-stations, connected by\r\ntelegraphs, will prove their real efficiency and blessing; and our\r\ndescendants, perhaps, will wonder how we could live without an\r\ninstitution, which to them will appear as simple and natural as do to us\r\ngaslights and railroads, which by our forefathers would have been\r\nrejected as idle dreams or works of witchcraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE FALSE WEATHER-PROPHETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wish to speak here a few words about the false methods, that have\r\nhitherto been applied to the investigation and foretelling of the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThe weather prophecies of the almanac are a disgrace to our advanced\r\nage. Those who still print them deserve that their productions should\r\nnowhere find sale. We are not of those who expect everything of the\r\nmagistrates and their orders; but an example should be set to prevent\r\nthe publishers from dishing up to the people such absurdities.\r\n\r\nSome of these wily prophets pretend to read their predictions in the\r\ncourse of the planets. For this purpose, they have divided the planets\r\ninto two classes, according to their positions in regard to the earth\r\nand sun: 1st, those that produce cold, and 2d, those that produce heat.\r\nBy this means they pretend to prophesy how many degrees of heat or cold\r\nthere will be every day at sunrise or sunset.\r\n\r\nWhen critically analyzed, these prophecies prove to be theoretically and\r\npractically nothing but charlatanry.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond all doubt that the position of the planets is, to state an\r\nexample, for Boston the same as for the city of Washington; if there are\r\nany heat or cold-producing planets, they would have the same effect at\r\nBoston that they would at Washington. But this is not the case. Boston\r\nhas often cold weather when in Washington it is very warm, and _vice\r\nversa_. Besides such a heating or cooling influence of planets would be\r\nperceivable on every spot of the earth alike which again is not\r\nwarranted by facts. On the contrary it often happens that when cold\r\nwinds are passing over one part of the country, warm winds are passing\r\nover another. It is almost certain that cold winters in Europe always\r\naccompany warm winters in America; and again, that cold winters in\r\nAmerica usually accompany warm ones in Europe. On a closer examination\r\nof the facts in the case, we must conclude that, on the whole,\r\nweather-prophets take things very easy. Noting the mean heat of each\r\nday, and trusting to their good luck, they prophesy one or two degrees\r\nabove or below. Now, there is no great risk in doing this, and as a\r\nmatter of course such prophecies are realized one out of two. But at\r\ntimes, almanacs announce an extraordinary increase of cold or heat for a\r\ngiven day, although the situation of the planets does not change\r\nsuddenly in one day. Then, their predictions very seldom prove to be\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the almanac-makers know how to manage affairs. The country\r\nbeing very large, they send for information to those places where\r\nobservations on the weather are made. It is almost certain that\r\nsomewhere in the land their prophesy has come true. Very likely the cold\r\nmay have increased extraordinarily in the course of a day at New York,\r\nBoston, Chicago, Cincinnati, or St. Louis, etc., afterwards the\r\nweather-prophets compare their predictions with the results of\r\nobservation in the various cities, and publish whatever of them are\r\nfound to have been true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nHAS THE MOON INFLUENCE UPON THE WEATHER?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea that the moon exercises an influence upon the state of the\r\nweather is very general, not only with the people, but also among the\r\nbetter educated. What induces them to entertain it, is not real\r\nobservation of nature, but a belief which is not without a semblance of\r\ntruth. If, they say, the moon has enough influence upon our waters to\r\nproduce tides, it must exercise a still greater influence upon the sea\r\nof air surrounding us, and hence it must be of the greatest importance\r\nto our weather.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, an illusion. A long time ago it was proved by Laplace,\r\nthat tides are caused by the great weight of a liquid. If the ocean were\r\nfilled with mercury instead of water, the tides would reach a formidable\r\nheight. Tides, then, do exist in the atmosphere, but in comparison much\r\nless than in the water, because the air is so much lighter. It happens\r\nthat we do not live on the surface of the atmosphere, but in the lowest\r\nstrata of this airy sea; and in these strata, where the weather\r\nmanifests itself, the effect of the tides in the upper air is so\r\ninsignificant, that nothing of it has yet been discovered in spite of\r\nmost diligent barometer observations.\r\n\r\nLearned men have had such a respect for this popular belief, that\r\nthorough observations and investigations have been made in order to\r\nsettle the question.\r\n\r\nThose investigations were of three kinds:\r\n\r\n1st. What influence with regard to heat and cold has the nearness or\r\nremoteness of the moon upon our weather? 2d. What influence has the\r\nsame upon rain or dryness in the atmosphere? 3d. Has the change of the\r\nmoon any bearing upon the variability of our weather?\r\n\r\nFor the reply to these questions, some naturalists have made use of the\r\nminutest observations for a period of nearly forty years; during which\r\ntime the temperature, pressure, and moisture of the air have been\r\nmeasured daily.\r\n\r\nThese observations have been scrupulously examined; the conclusion\r\narrived at is, that the moon is not quite without influence upon the\r\nstate of our atmosphere; but this influence is so very small, that it is\r\nnot brought to bear at all on meteorology.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon is nearest to the earth, it is certainly a little colder\r\nthan when she is farther off; but the decrease of heat amounts in the\r\naverage scarcely to one-fifth of a degree, and this is a quantity\r\nentirely imperceptible in our weather. As to rain, it is a little less\r\nfrequent in the time of the moon's greatest distance from the earth; but\r\nthis difference, too, is imperceptibly small. In one thousand\r\nrain-storms there are four hundred and eighty-eight during the moon's\r\ngreatest distance, five hundred and twelve during her nearest. As to the\r\npressure of the air, it is during the moon's greater distance somewhat\r\ngreater than when she is nearer, but this difference is still less than\r\nthe preceding ones, so much so that a common barometer does not even\r\nindicate it.\r\n\r\nThe most thorough investigations have been made about the influence of\r\nthe waxing and waning moon upon the weather, because it was on this\r\nsubject that the greatest illusion prevailed. The result here is\r\nlikewise, that scarcely any difference exists, and that it is a mere\r\nsuperstition for people to maintain, that when the moon changes, the\r\nweather changes also. The change in the moon, moreover, does not take\r\nplace all of a sudden, but with great regularity from day to day, from\r\nminute to minute; while the weather, especially with us, changes often\r\nvery abruptly.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore certain, that in meteorology one has only to observe the\r\nearth and her position with regard to the sun, together with the\r\ncurrents of air and the position of land and water. Other phenomena of\r\nthe atmosphere may be entirely omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VII.\r\n\r\nOUR ARTICLES OF FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE RAPID RENEWAL OF THE BLOOD IS AN ADVANTAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur articles of food are also called _articles of life_, and very\r\nproperly so; for that which lives in us is, indeed, nothing but food\r\ntransformed into ourselves.\r\n\r\nAccording to this, it is very easy to determine what a man must eat in\r\norder to live; what kind of food can best maintain his health; what\r\nconstantly renews his working-power; what compensates for the loss he\r\nexperiences by emission of breath, perspiration, and excretions.\r\n\r\nThis easy task many have proposed to themselves. They believe they have\r\nsolved the problem, if they can but prove that all parts of the human\r\nbody are fed by the blood; and, the constituents of the blood being well\r\nknown, they believe they have done enough, if they designate that food\r\nas the most proper for man which contains the constituent parts of the\r\nblood, or which, by digestion, may be changed into blood.\r\n\r\nAs a general thing this is true; yet it is not sufficient to give the\r\nnecessary information about the principal articles of our food.\r\n\r\nThe poor Irishman, who lives almost exclusively on potatoes, has as much\r\nblood in his body as the Englishman, whose workmen threaten him with a\r\nstrike, if they do not earn enough to have a piece of meat and a good\r\nglass of beer for breakfast. The Irishman's blood contains quite the\r\nsame elements that the Englishman's does, and yet their food is very\r\ndifferent; and the Irishman is as justly called \"poor,\" as the\r\nEnglishman is said to be \"well fed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the blood alone does not account for this, nor can it\r\ndo so. There must be other additional items; and these we shall try to\r\nlearn before we speak of the different articles of food and their worth.\r\n\r\nThe first principle which we must set up before all others, runs thus:\r\nNutrition does not depend on the blood, but rather on its quick renewal.\r\n\r\nThe blood resembles the capital which a man possesses. No one can live\r\non his capital without consuming it; he must live on the interest of the\r\ncapital; he must live by constantly turning the capital over. And so\r\nmust it be with the blood. The comparison seems so perfect, that we can\r\nillustrate our idea best by an example.\r\n\r\nImagine two merchants, each of whom has but a hundred dollars. Both\r\nmerchants are therefore equally rich in capital. But there is the\r\nfollowing difference between them: the one goes to the country twice a\r\nweek and buys cattle and brings it to market, where he sells it again.\r\nBy doing this he realizes every time five dollars on his capital. The\r\nother establishes a notion-store, buys himself a hundred dollars' worth\r\nof goods, which he sells in a month, and thereby gains twenty-five\r\ndollars. Now, which of these two fares the better? The notion-dealer,\r\nwho with his hundred dollars has earned twenty-five dollars, or the\r\ncattle-dealer, who gained but five? Most assuredly the cattle-dealer.\r\nFor while the other has twenty-five dollars to live on, the\r\ncattle-dealer has eight times five, or forty dollars. Whence does this\r\ncome? In a month the notion-dealer turns over his capital but once,\r\nwhile the cattle-dealer turns his eight times.\r\n\r\nThe same holds good with the Irishman and the Englishman. Both have the\r\nsame quantity of blood; it is their capital, and the same for both. But\r\nthe renewal is not the same. The Englishman works vigorously and eats\r\nvigorously. When he works, he spends his capital, his blood; by every\r\nblow of the hammer particles of his body are wasted; the activity of his\r\nbody is great and his appetite is great. He invests his capital again\r\nand again in rapid succession, and he takes it in just as rapidly and\r\nfares well with it. The poor, unhappy Irishman, however, spends his\r\nblood but very slowly; he does not work; he eats potatoes, which, taken\r\nalone, are bad food; thus, he invests his capital very slowly and takes\r\nit in again very slowly; and though the capital is in both cases the\r\nsame, its slow renewal is the cause of the Irishman's being miserable,\r\ndull, and lazy, while the Englishman is sound in body and soul.\r\n\r\nTherefore the blood alone is not all, but its rapid consumption and\r\nrenewal is the most important object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDIGESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding article we said that the rapid conversion and waste of\r\nthe blood is the main point in nutrition. In the examination of food,\r\nonly such articles ought to be pronounced good and healthy, as are\r\ncapable of _rapidly_ replacing the blood lost by work and vital\r\nactivity. It follows from this, that our chemists do not do enough, when\r\nthey examine the food and determine its worth merely according to its\r\ncontents; articles of food must be studied also in reference to the\r\nrapidity and ease with which they may be converted into blood.\r\n\r\nAn article that contains little of what the blood needs, but which\r\nconverts that little rapidly and easily into blood, is much preferable\r\nto food which contains many of the constituent parts of the blood, but\r\nturns into blood very slowly and with difficulty.\r\n\r\nAn example will illustrate this better:\r\n\r\nIt has been proved chemically, that the husks of grain, the pure bran,\r\ncontain a remarkably large quantity of vegetable albumen and fat; in\r\nthis particular, bran is richer than even flour, and a distinguished\r\nchemist, Millon, in Paris, in 1849, created quite a sensation by his\r\nearnest admonition to use bran no longer only to feed cattle, but to use\r\nit mixed with flour, as food for man. He calculated minutely and proved\r\nirrefutably, that such food must be considered a great advantage, a real\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\nAlthough his investigations and computations were correct, it has since\r\nbeen shown that his proposition is false. In his capacity of a chemist\r\nhe was right; but the stomach has not as much time and patience as a\r\nstudious chemist. Notwithstanding bran contains much that the blood can\r\nuse, yet it is of no avail so long as our digestive apparatus is not\r\norganized to perform the change of the bran into blood _rapidly_ and\r\n_easily_. If bran leaves our body undigested, which happens even to the\r\nstrongest, then it is certainly more judicious to give it to cattle;\r\nthey can digest it well, grow fat and strong upon it, and give us meat,\r\nfat, and milk in return.\r\n\r\nThere is another truth we must constantly keep in view; it is this: Of\r\ntwo like articles of food, the better and more advantageous one to us is\r\nthat which is digested, or better, converted into blood, the more easily\r\nand quickly.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a third truth, which must not be omitted. Let no one for a\r\nmoment believe, that a great variety of food is something unimportant\r\nand indifferent; on the contrary, investigations have shown that uniform\r\nfood is hurtful, while a constant change is very beneficial to nutrition\r\nand health.\r\n\r\nNor must we neglect, by way of conclusion, to mention a very important\r\nitem, viz.: that taste comes in for a large share, and that a judicious\r\nassortment and seasoning of the food is an essential part of good\r\nnutrition. The husband provides for his wife, it is true; but, on the\r\nother hand, the good housewife who prepares healthy, tasteful meals,\r\ndoes in truth perform a great service, and contributes more to the\r\nworking power of her husband, than most of men are aware.\r\n\r\nAfter these few preliminaries, we will speak now of the articles\r\nthemselves; in doing so, we shall keep within the limits of practical\r\nlife, though we run the risk of transgressing here and there into the\r\ndomain of our good housewives, and of meddling with what, according to\r\ntheir idea, is not our business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to consider the various articles of food in detail. We shall\r\ntake for guide neither the luxurious life of the rich, who, on account\r\nof his disordered stomach, constantly tickles his palate with dainties;\r\nnor the miserable life of the poor, who, on account of his empty\r\nstomach, is bound to find everything palatable. We wish rather to take\r\ninto consideration the food of that class of people in which the husband\r\nworks hard to support his family; and where the wife is a good\r\nhousewife, and cares for the health and strength of her husband and\r\nchildren. In other words, we wish to consider the kind of food called\r\n_household fare_, and speak of the meals as taken every day.\r\n\r\nIt is customary with most to take coffee in the morning.\r\n\r\nNow, what are the qualities of coffee? Is coffee an article of food? Or\r\nis it a beverage merely to quench the thirst? Is it a means of warming?\r\nOr is it a spice? Medicine? Or perhaps poison?\r\n\r\nIt is strange that science has not yet reached the truth about these\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nCoffee has been chemically analyzed, and has been found to contain a\r\npeculiar element, caffeine, which has an abundance of nitrogen. It is\r\nremarkable also that tea has been found to contain an element called\r\ntheine, which has the same quantity of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nAs in some countries tea replaces coffee--this is especially the case in\r\nRussia, Holland, England, and America--the great and ingenious\r\nnaturalist Liebig has come to the conclusion that it is nitrogen which\r\nconstitutes the chief value of tea and coffee as articles of food; and\r\nas our blood needs nitrogen, in order to be able to form our muscles and\r\nflesh, coffee, according to Liebig, must be counted among the articles\r\nof food.\r\n\r\nIn later times this view has been attacked. Although it is true that\r\nnitrogen is very abundant in coffee, and that we need nitrogen to form\r\nmuscles, yet it can never be the nitrogen which incites us to the\r\nenjoyment of coffee. It is the berry of the coffee that contains the\r\nnitrogen; a part of it escapes during the process of roasting; a great\r\npart is thrown away with the coffee-grounds, so that the quantity of\r\nnitrogen actually left in the infusion is exceedingly small. Besides, if\r\nwe enjoy in coffee only the nitrogen, we pay very high for it.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, annually about two hundred and fifty millions of\r\npounds of coffee are used; the cost is estimated at twenty-five millions\r\nof dollars. Since the coffee itself is not consumed, but only the\r\ninfusion, it follows that about 100,000 pounds of nitrogen are consumed\r\nat a cost of 250 millions of dollars, which is a terrible waste,\r\nconsidering that for this money seven times as much nitrogen could be\r\ntaken, if, instead of coffee, meat were used, which contains also a\r\nlarge quantity of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe natural sciences, therefore, show among their scholars professed\r\nenemies of coffee. They are, from a medical as well as economical point\r\nof view, decidedly opposed to its use. Some have even gone so far as to\r\ndeclare it poisonous; a naturalist by name of Zobel proved that it\r\ncontains Prussic acid, one of the deadliest poisons. Fortunately we know\r\nthat this Prussic acid is rendered ineffectual by the ammoniac which\r\ncoffee contains, and which is used as an antidote against Prussic acid.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, we have reason to esteem coffee very highly. A\r\nbeverage which has become such a necessity to every nation, is of great\r\nimportance; and the instinct with which millions and millions of our\r\nfellow-men are drawn to its enjoyment, is the best proof that the use of\r\ncoffee is not hurtful, but advantageous to man; notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat in some diseases it is forbidden, and that science has not yet\r\nsucceeded in showing us the real advantage of coffee as a means of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCOFFEE AS A MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent times coffee has been considered, not as an article of food,\r\nbut partly as a spice and partly as a kind of medicine. Spice it is,\r\ninasmuch as it causes, like many other spices, the stomach to secrete an\r\nincreased quantity of gastric juice. Digestion only takes place when the\r\nsides of the stomach secrete a liquid having the quality of digesting\r\nfood. Owing to this, well-to-do people take after dinner a cup of coffee\r\nin order to promote digestion. It is because at night the power of\r\ndigesting is very much enfeebled--hence the bad sleep after one has\r\neaten something difficult to digest--and because the stomach is relaxed\r\nand inactive, that a cup of coffee in the morning refreshes and\r\nstimulates the coats of the stomach, and causes there renewed vigor and\r\nactivity. It is a common observation, that more appetite is felt after\r\ncoffee than before it. So much for the importance of coffee as a spice.\r\nVery justly we ascribe to coffee also a medicinal influence; we consider\r\nit a medicine for our mental activity, and for the activity of the\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that at night coffee dispels fatigue, and that by the\r\nuse of strong coffee sleep may be banished for a long time. And more;\r\nthose that are busy mentally, often feel a fresh, invigorating impulse\r\nafter the enjoyment of coffee; when fatigued with work, they make it a\r\nmeans to recruit their strength. For a similar reason, coffee can\r\nanimate conversation. When we meet elderly ladies in society, and notice\r\nthem sitting quietly and talking but in monosyllables, we need not be\r\nsurprised; they have had no coffee yet! But when, after a little,\r\nconversation flows with full force like a rapid stream of water, we may\r\nfrom this safely recognize the mighty influence of coffee; it has\r\nloosened not only the tongues, but more--the looks, the hands, nay, the\r\nwhole body and the whole soul.\r\n\r\nAlthough the mind has rested during the night, we feel in the morning\r\nrather sleepy than otherwise, and hence it is, that we are every morning\r\ndesirous of stimulating our nervous system with a cup of coffee,\r\npreparing, as it were, our mind for the day's work. A modern naturalist,\r\nas genial as he is learned, Moleschott, ascribes the lately increased\r\nconsumption of coffee to the greater degree of mental activity, which\r\nlife in former times did not require to such a high extent as our\r\npresent age.\r\n\r\nWe have now sufficiently explained the need of coffee-drinking, and we\r\nmust confess that all we have said here does not in the least affect our\r\nconviction that, according to Liebig, coffee is also nutritive. And no\r\none can help believing this who has seen how old people can subsist on\r\nbut very little food, provided they can have plenty of coffee. The\r\nobjection raised, that it would be better for these persons to take the\r\nnitrogen contained in coffee in the form of meat, is correct; but, on\r\nthe other hand, we must stop to ask, whether meat would be good for the\r\nstomach at all such times as a cup of coffee is! This would certainly\r\nnot be the case early in the morning; and if in the coffee we enjoy a\r\nbeverage which gives us nutriment, strengthens the stomach and at the\r\nsame time stimulates our mind, we have good reasons to reverence the\r\ninstinct of man which raised coffee to an essential means of\r\nsubsistence, and discovered its beneficial influence long before this\r\nwas done by science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nUSEFULNESS AND HURTFULNESS OF COFFEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince coffee possesses the quality of stimulating the nervous system, it\r\nis a matter of course that in many cases its effect is rather injurious.\r\nPhlegmatic people, especially, need coffee, and they are fond of\r\ndrinking it; for a similar reason it is a favorite beverage in the\r\nOrient, where its consumption is immense. But to persons of an excitable\r\ntemperament the enjoyment of coffee is hurtful; they ought only to take\r\nit very weak. With lively children it does not agree at all, and it is\r\nvery wrong to force them to drink it, as is often done; while elderly\r\npeople, who are in need of a stimulant for the decreasing activity of\r\ntheir nerves, are right in taking as much of it as they choose.\r\n\r\nIn households of limited means it is often customary to use succory with\r\ncoffee. We do not pretend to pronounce this, if taken in moderate\r\nquantity, hurtful; but we do say, that it is a poor substitute for\r\ncoffee, and that there is nothing in it to recommend its use. A far\r\nbetter mixture is milk and sugar, and there is good reason for it; both\r\nmilk and sugar are articles of food. Milk contains the same ingredients\r\nas blood, and sugar is changed in the body into fat, which is\r\nindispensable to us, especially to the process of breathing. Having\r\ntaken no food through the night, the loss our blood has suffered during\r\nsleep by perspiration, and the fat which has been lost by respiration,\r\nmust be compensated for in the morning. For this, milk and sugar in\r\ncoffee are excellent. It is good for children to have a taste for\r\nsweetened milk, or milk-coffee, in the morning. We must not find fault\r\nwith them if they like it. Nature very wisely gave them a liking for\r\nsugar; they need it, because their pulse must be quicker, their\r\nrespiration stronger, in order to facilitate the assimilation of food in\r\ntheir bodies, and also to promote growth. Not that adults need no sugar;\r\nbut the sugar necessary for them is formed from the starch contained in\r\ntheir food. For this purpose the digestive apparatus must be strongly\r\ndeveloped; with children this is not the case; therefore they are given\r\nsugar, instead of the starch to make it from. Many diseases,\r\nparticularly rickets--prevailing mostly among the children of the\r\npoor--are the consequence of feeding the child with bread and potatoes;\r\nthese contain starch it is true, but the digestive apparatus of children\r\nbeing yet too weak to change them into fat, the result is that the flesh\r\nfalls away, and the bones grow soft and crooked.\r\n\r\nBut he who, to promote digestion, takes coffee immediately after dinner,\r\ndoes best not to use sugar or milk; for both, so far from helping\r\ndigestion, are an additional burden to the full stomach, and disturb its\r\nlabor more than the coffee can facilitate it.\r\n\r\nIt is very good to take wheat bread for breakfast. Wheat has nearly\r\ntwice the quantity of sugar and starch that rye contains, and it is\r\nbesides easier to digest. And as it is our principal duty in the morning\r\nto replace as quickly as possible what we have lost during the night, it\r\nis a matter of importance to give the stomach such food as is both\r\nnutritive and quickly digested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkmen, even those who must perform hard labor, are sufficiently\r\nstrengthened by coffee and wheat bread in the morning to begin their\r\nwork. But to be able to continue it, a more substantial breakfast is\r\nnecessary, since coffee and bread alone would only replace what was lost\r\nduring the night. On the continent of Europe it is therefore the custom\r\nto take coffee, or milk, and bread very early, and, at about nine or ten\r\no'clock a more substantial meal, a kind of lunch.\r\n\r\nBreakfast is with but few the principal meal of the day; for those,\r\nhowever, who rise early it is the one taken with the best appetite. This\r\nfact ought to induce all to give attention to this meal; especially\r\nthose who early in the morning have worked hard already, and those who,\r\nmindful of the old saying,\r\n\r\n    \"Early to bed and early to rise\r\n    Makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise,\"\r\n\r\nintend not to idle away the precious morning hours.\r\n\r\nTo him who is in the habit of laboring, and who loves to labor, an early\r\nbreakfast has a peculiar charm; and, what is yet more important to him,\r\nit tastes well. It is customary with us to eat much bread. Bread has as\r\nits principal constituents, starch and sugar, and if it has been well\r\nbaked, a part of the starch is already saccharine, that is, it is nearly\r\ntransformed into sugar, thus greatly facilitating the process of\r\ndigestion. French naturalists have lately written excellent treatises\r\nabout the change which fresh bread undergoes when it becomes old. They\r\nprove that bread is most nutritive, and easiest to digest, when about a\r\nday old.\r\n\r\nBread is changed in our bodies partly into fat, as all food is which\r\ncontains starch. But this formation of fat is greatly facilitated, if we\r\ntake a little ready-made fat with it. For this purpose we eat butter\r\nwith our bread. Hence we see that some people are wrong when they\r\nbelieve butter to be a mere luxury; on the contrary, butter is a very\r\nimportant article of food, more especially so to children.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this is, that the fat performs a conspicuous part in the\r\nhuman body; it serves to keep up the process of respiration. The oxygen\r\nwhich is inhaled, decomposes the fat in our body and from it forms water\r\nand carbonic acid. The water evaporates through perspiration; the\r\ncarbonic acid is exhaled again. Now, if there is fat in us, this\r\nperspiration and exhalation will diminish it; but this very act of using\r\nup the fat preserves our flesh from being consumed in the process of\r\nproducing carbonic acid and perspiration, which, if there were no fat,\r\nwould greatly weaken us. Fat, thus to speak, is the spare-money, while\r\nflesh is the capital in the body. Fat itself does not make us strong,\r\nwhile flesh does. But where there is no fat, the processes of\r\nperspiration and respiration attack our flesh, which, unless abundantly\r\nreinforced, begins to disappear rapidly, while our strength begins to\r\ndecrease more and more.\r\n\r\nThence it comes that lean persons eat much, while we often are\r\nastonished to see how little food is taken by fat people. The lean one\r\nhas no fat to meet the drain produced by perspiration and respiration;\r\nhe breathes and perspires accordingly at the expense of his flesh, and,\r\ntherefore, is obliged to continually take in a fresh supply of food. The\r\nfat person, meanwhile, does not live on his capital, the flesh and the\r\nblood, but on his supply of fat; as it were, he pays expenses from his\r\nspare-money, and for this reason loses very little in strength.\r\n\r\nFrom what has preceded, it follows that he who breathes much and\r\nperspires much when at work, must eat much fat-producing food, and\r\nbesides add a little ready-made fat; while he who breathes and perspires\r\nlittle, needs but little of that kind of food. This accounts for the\r\ncircumstance that in winter, when the air is denser, and therefore one\r\ninhales more oxygen and thus uses more fat for exhalation, we must eat\r\nmore fat food; while in summer every one takes less of it. We know that\r\nin cold countries food is taken which, on account of its containing\r\ngreat quantities of fat, would in hot climates produce sickness.\r\n\r\nA hearty worker perspires much at his labor, and, in consequence of his\r\nincreased activity, breathes more than the quiet and sedentary; he must\r\ntherefore eat with his breakfast some fat--bacon, etc.--because this\r\nenables him to prevent his flesh and blood from decreasing. His body\r\nwill be strong and powerful, and he will at all times be able to earn\r\nwith his arm more than his stomach costs him.\r\n\r\nBut let no one believe, therefore, that fat alone is a means of food,\r\nand, above all, beware of the mistake that ready-made fat is healthier\r\nto eat than fat-producing articles. Fine experiments have been made\r\nabout the feeding of animals with fat. The results have shown that fat\r\ntaken alone is injurious, and goes off again without having been of any\r\nuse to the body; while, on the other hand, fat-producing food greatly\r\nassists the fattening of animals.\r\n\r\nHe who has seen how geese are fattened, will have a correct idea about\r\nthe process of the formation of fat in the human body. A handful of\r\ndough is forced into the mouth and gullet of the goose; during the time\r\nof her fattening she is shut up in so close a space that she can neither\r\nrise nor walk about. The poor creature is thus deprived of evaporation\r\nby perspiration; the process of breathing is rendered very difficult;\r\nand, because she breathes and perspires little, her fat does not change\r\ninto carbonic acid and water, but collects in the body in an unusual\r\nmanner, until finally the creature is relieved from her pains by being\r\nkilled. We see that her fat is nothing else than the transformed starch\r\nof the dough, which remained in the body without being used. If we\r\nshould try, however, to feed a goose on pure fat only, she would not\r\nfatten at all, but fall sick. Pure fat must only be taken together with\r\nfat-producing food. The cause of this is, that only a part of the\r\nintestines secretes a juice which can dissolve fat; while the gastric\r\njuice in the stomach does not dissolve the fat at all, but allows it to\r\nfloat on the surface, as fat does in water.\r\n\r\nOur readers will now find it natural that a workman who perspires and\r\nbreathes much, should by all means take but little bacon for breakfast;\r\nand this he must eat only on those days when he has much work before\r\nhim; and then he must not eat it without bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLIQUOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it advisable to take a \"drink\" before breakfast?\r\n\r\nThis is a question of the greatest importance, and requires a very clear\r\nand impartial answer; for which our space is almost too limited.\r\n\r\nLiquor is no article of food; if for a moment it were considered as\r\nsuch, we should find that it is even less nutritious than water with\r\nsugar in it. What makes liquor a necessary article, especially so to the\r\nworking-classes, is a certain quality it possesses, a quality just as\r\ndangerous as it is good.\r\n\r\nLiquor is a favorite beverage because of the alcohol it contains; this\r\nis nothing else than sugar which has undergone fermentation. Alcohol may\r\nbe made from all those plants from which starch can be obtained; for, by\r\nthe proper process, starch may be changed into gluten, gluten into\r\nsugar, and sugar into alcohol. Alcohol therefore conveys more nutriment\r\nto the human body than sugar itself, while it has qualities that the\r\nsugar does not possess, and which make it an article as popular as it is\r\ndangerous. If taken in small quantities, alcohol affects the body like\r\nmedicine; in large portions, like poison. We are therefore not surprised\r\nif partly we cannot do without it, and if, on the other hand, we hear it\r\ncondemned every day. What makes its enjoyment so very dangerous is, that\r\nalthough it is no article of food, it offers to the hungry a kind of\r\nsubstitute for food, and, what is worse, a substitute which is often the\r\ncheapest, and of most rapid effect in regard to quieting one's\r\nappetite. It is owing to this that its enjoyment may produce the most\r\nfatal and pernicious evils that ever were inflicted upon unhappy man.\r\n\r\nLet us now learn the medicinal qualities of liquor, so that we may see\r\nthat it is natural for it to be a favorite; and by exhibiting the\r\ndangers of its enjoyment, we shall succeed best in showing that people\r\nare justified in condemning its intemperate use; but it will also be\r\nseen that, in spite of the evident hurtfulness, its entire banishment\r\nwould be a foolishness not resulting in good.\r\n\r\nLiquor, if taken in a very small dose, possesses the quality of\r\nincreasing the quantity of gastric juices. It excites the sides of the\r\nstomach, and by this promotes the secretion of the juice by which food\r\nis dissolved. It often occurs, that if but a minute quantity of fat has\r\nbeen taken, it envelops the food in the stomach; and as the gastric\r\njuice dissolves fat only with great difficulty, this food often remains\r\nundigested in the stomach, and nutrition then is carried on but\r\ndefectively. Digestion, therefore, may be greatly improved, if the\r\nstomach is so affected as to secrete a greater quantity of gastric\r\njuice; this is often done by means of spice--for example, by putting a\r\nlittle pepper upon bacon or ham. The pepper itself does not help\r\ndissolve food, but excites the salivary glands and the stomach, thus\r\nincreasing the gastric juice which performs digestion.\r\n\r\nIf fat has been eaten, the same effect may be produced by a little\r\nliquor. Indeed, it is even preferable to spice, inasmuch as it contains\r\nether, which alone is able to dissolve fat.\r\n\r\nThus we have seen that liquor is a kind of medicine. And although every\r\none must strive to do without medicine, still he must not condemn it; he\r\nshould scorn rather the wantonness which throws itself on the mercy of\r\nmedicine. It is right to oppose the enjoyment of much fat; but if once\r\ntoo much of it has been taken, there is no reason why we should\r\nremonstrate against the medical application of a small quantity of\r\nliquor. To those who believe that they see in alcohol the evil spirit\r\nhimself, it may some time or other happen, that even they eat a little\r\ntoo much fat, and then seek relief by taking some patent or other\r\nmedicine, dropped on sugar. Most medicines used in such cases, however,\r\nare nothing but mixtures of sulphuric ether and alcohol; and if alcohol\r\nis the evil spirit, he is certainly not changed into an angel by putting\r\nhim on sugar.\r\n\r\nBut liquor has yet another effect of great importance.\r\n\r\nThe alcohol it contains is immediately conveyed to the blood; through\r\nthis it affects the brain and the nerves, exciting them to increased\r\nactivity. By also affecting the nerves of the heart, it accelerates the\r\ncirculation of the blood; this produces throughout the body a more rapid\r\nvital activity.\r\n\r\n\"Wine,\" the Bible says, \"maketh glad the heart of man.\"\r\n\r\nAnd wine itself is nothing else but an alcohol-combination. The\r\nanimating element in wine is the same as the one in liquor. But it makes\r\nman's heart glad; which means as much as, it increases our vital\r\nactivity; it rouses; it strengthens the weary and him who is exhausted\r\nbodily or mentally; it excites the body as well as the mind to move\r\nvigorous action. Taken in very small quantity, liquor has the same\r\neffect. It is therefore not only good for digestion, but also a prompt\r\nremedy for exhaustion. The reanimation, however, produced by the use of\r\nstimulants, is by no means a real gain; for he who feels tired and weary\r\nis best restored by nature herself. Artificial stimulation is followed\r\nby a greater reaction, by which all is lost again that has been gained\r\nby artificial animation. Yet many cases occur in human life when there\r\nis no time for the natural restoration of strength lost; thus, when it\r\nis preferable to complete one's task without delay, without rest until\r\nit is finished. In such cases the desire for artificial stimulants is\r\neasily explained; then we ought not to condemn a moderate use of them,\r\nbecause that use is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe wanderer on his travels, the soldier in camp or battle, have often\r\nneither time nor opportunity to refresh themselves with a meal, or to\r\nrecruit strength by a good rest. With them it is important to complete\r\ntheir journey or task, and to rest afterwards. A common workman may, at\r\ntimes, be in the same situation. In such cases a little brandy is of\r\ngreat service. It increases vital activity and courage; in many\r\ncountries the army is for this reason permitted to use liquor, although,\r\nof course, sparingly.\r\n\r\nHaving now spoken of the medicinal use of liquor, we wish to examine\r\nmore closely its dangers, and to explain the reason why its enjoyment is\r\nto many so great a temptation as often to become a passion.\r\n\r\nA slight quantity of liquor taken at breakfast, makes one feel increased\r\nvital activity. The pulse beats quicker, the mind is stirred up,\r\ndigestion easier, and before the food has been transformed into blood,\r\nwe feel animated to vigorous bodily activity and motion. The enjoyment\r\nof spirit fills the long pause between the meal itself and its change\r\ninto blood. He who feels exhausted and eats, has yet but satisfied the\r\ndemands of the stomach, without therewith replenishing his blood. It\r\ntakes a long time, often from five to six hours, before the blood is\r\ndirectly benefited. It is owing to this, that after dinner we do not\r\nfeel lively, but inactive, disposed to rest. Now, he who after dinner\r\ncannot rest, but must continue to work, is anxious to stimulate himself\r\nby a dram of liquor, because this will act more quickly than the food he\r\nhas taken. The spirits he took fill the long pause which exists between\r\nhis meal and its complete transformation into blood.\r\n\r\nIs it any longer surprising, that it is the workmen who mostly are\r\nsubject to the use of spirits? No, we are not surprised; we feel sorry\r\nthat they are not taught better; that instead of imparting to the people\r\na knowledge of things useful to the preservation of health, we\r\nconstantly remind them of the \"devil and hell;\" and that in place of\r\nteaching them, by the study of nature, how to avoid errors and dangers,\r\nwe merely try to frighten them with future punishments.\r\n\r\nThe danger of spirits consists in this, that their good qualities, their\r\nadvantageous effects, manifest themselves immediately, while their evils\r\nappear later. Liquor is not unlike a man whose virtues are laid open to\r\nevery one; whose vices, however, are hidden, and who therefore is\r\nseductive and dangerous. If we wish to warn our fellow-men against such\r\na one, we must not do it by denying or concealing his virtues; on the\r\ncontrary, we must openly tell all his good qualities; the warning in\r\nwhich we lay bare his vices, will then be more, all the more readily\r\nheeded.\r\n\r\nTrue, liquor is a medicine; but, like every other medical remedy, it\r\nbecomes poisonous in the body of him who puts himself continually in\r\nsuch a condition as to be obliged to use it.\r\n\r\nHe who wishes to preserve his health, must not try to help nature by\r\nartificial means; he will only become weak. To illustrate this by an\r\nexample: it is a well-known fact, that milk contains all the constituent\r\nparts of the blood; but if we were to feed a man merely on milk, those\r\norgans given him by nature to digest solid food, would weaken to such a\r\ndegree that he would fall mortally ill. Man is healthy only when he\r\npermits nature the free and unlimited exercise of her functions; if he\r\nhelps nature too much he may kill himself. It is similar with the use of\r\nliquor. The person who only now and then corrects nature, that is, when\r\nshe actually needs it, is perfectly right. But he is very wrong and\r\nharms himself greatly, who wishes to assist nature when she needs no\r\nhelp. Unfortunately, the latter is very often the case, and the prime\r\nsource of evil. The ignorant, having once had the experience that brandy\r\npromotes digestion, thinks it is good for him to continue to help his\r\nstomach; but he is greatly mistaken. By accustoming his stomach to\r\nsecrete gastric juice only after the partaking of brandy, he weakens it;\r\nthe natural digestion becomes defective through this; and the enjoyment\r\nof spirits, at first a medical remedy, rapidly becomes an indispensable\r\nnecessity, with all its evil consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nINJURIOUSNESS OF DRINKING LIQUOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who accustoms his stomach to secrete gastric juice only after a\r\nstimulus effected by spirits, destroys his digestive power. Unhappy man!\r\nHe is no longer able to digest food, unless he stimulate his stomach\r\nwith liquor. The already weak stomach is, by this habit, weakened more\r\nand more. Soon a small quantity will no longer suffice; a larger portion\r\nmust effect what formerly was done by the smaller; this goes further and\r\nfurther, until finally the _drinker_ becomes--a _drunkard_.\r\n\r\nIt is well to look at the terrible consequences of such a condition more\r\nclosely, to obtain a clear idea of it; and to examine all the\r\ncircumstances which unfortunately produce it, mostly among the poorer\r\nand working classes.\r\n\r\nThe condition of an intoxicated person is to be distinguished from that\r\nof a regular drunkard. The former has taken alcohol; it goes into the\r\nblood, arrives in the brain, and excites the nerves to increased action.\r\nThe nerves of the heart are also affected by it, and cause violent\r\nbeating of the heart and pulse. The blood courses through the veins and\r\nrushes to the brain. This produces illusions of the senses, and\r\nconfusion of sensations; sparks before the eyes; buzzing in the ears;\r\ndizziness, which makes the walk unsteady; redness of the skin and eyes;\r\nincreased perspiration; greater activity in the lungs; a shorter and\r\nmore rapid breathing; excitement of the mind to anger, and dimness of\r\nthe faculties of judgment, causing the inebriate to believe that he\r\npossesses superior strength. If he begins to move about, these\r\nmanifestations, and especially the dizziness, increase; the slightest\r\nobstacle in the road causes him to stumble or fall; he cannot raise\r\nhimself to his feet, nor can he sit up; but, lying on the ground, he is\r\nunconscious of everything around him; overcome with complete\r\nexhaustion--the effect of the reaction--he at last falls asleep; but his\r\nsleep does not rest him, although, if sufficiently long, it will restore\r\nthe unfortunate to consciousness. He now suffers from that peculiar\r\nfatigue and lassitude which usually follow intoxication.\r\n\r\nTo this abject state every one is brought who in the enjoyment of\r\nspirits loses self-control. It is an unworthy, disgraceful and\r\ndisgusting condition; but even the best of men may once fall into it;\r\nall the more so, if he is no habitual drinker. Strictly speaking, this\r\nsubject belongs to another chapter; it belongs to that of intemperance,\r\ndissoluteness or bad society. If such a calamity has befallen an\r\notherwise good man, let him amend his bodily ache by a cold bath; and\r\nhis moral ache by an earnest vow not to do the like again.\r\n\r\nFar more serious, however, is the lot of the real drunkard. This belongs\r\nto the chapter on nutrition, for it is true, we are sorry to say, that\r\ndrunkards are produced mostly through want of proper nutriment; and it\r\nis always the case that constant intemperance is accompanied by that\r\nsickly condition in which the stomach is unable to digest solid food.\r\n\r\nIn a word, he who has accustomed his stomach to perform digestion only\r\nafter the use of stimulants, has laid the foundation for drunkenness.\r\nWith wealthy people, we know it to be frequently the case, that they\r\ntake something \"strong\" in order to promote digestion; but the danger is\r\nhere less great. For if the rich be convinced of his wrong, even at a\r\nlate period, he can yet proceed in his reform energetically. He can\r\nafford to take liquid, easily digestible food instead of solid. He will\r\neat little meat; but that little very savory and prepared in a manner to\r\nbe easily digested. He will choose but light vegetables. He will flavor\r\nhis breakfast with caviare and lemon; and at dinner he will relish rich\r\nstewed fruit, by means of which appetite and digestion are increased.\r\nShould he not feel strengthened immediately after dinner, he has\r\nsufficient time to wait till his food is transformed into blood. He\r\ntakes a nap after dinner, and a pleasant walk in the open air, to get an\r\nappetite for his well-selected supper.\r\n\r\nNow, all these are excellent means to restore the wealthy man's appetite\r\nand digestive powers, even if he has gone so far in drinking as to\r\nweaken his stomach. It is not _virtue_ and _temperance_ that causes the\r\n_less_ number of drunkards among the rich, but the ready _compensation_\r\nthey can afford, to cure themselves. And it not unfrequently occurs,\r\nthat when the rich man loses his fortune, or, in other words, when he\r\nbecomes poor, he becomes a drunkard. People generally excuse this,\r\nsaying, \"it is from despair;\" but the truth is, that now he can no\r\nlonger afford the costly compensation which previously preserved him\r\nfrom such a fate.\r\n\r\nBut what will the poor do in such a case more especially the workman?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE POOR AND THE LIQUOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poor workman who has accustomed his stomach to perform digestion\r\nonly through the excitement of a previous stimulant, cannot, even if he\r\nknows the miserable condition he is in, abandon this bad habit without\r\nalmost superhuman efforts.\r\n\r\nWorking makes him hungry; but his stomach not being able to digest solid\r\nfood, eating becomes disagreeable to him. His relaxing strength,\r\nhowever, demands support. His vital activity is suppressed; he must have\r\na fresh supply of strength to be able to work and earn his living. To\r\naccomplish this, he knows no other means than liquor again! For,\r\nunfortunately, experience has taught him that spirits not only stimulate\r\nhim for the moment and increase his vital activity, but that they can\r\nalso be to him a kind of substitute for food.\r\n\r\nIt was not until quite recently that science told us how and in what\r\nmanner the use of spirits may actually promote the working power of the\r\nstarving. It is of the utmost importance to obtain a correct idea of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nWork promotes evaporation and respiration. Evaporation, however, that is\r\nperspiration proper, is nothing but a part of the food we have taken,\r\nand which is thus secreted from the body. Precisely the same holds good\r\nwith the breath we exhale; it consists of carbonic acid, which is\r\nlikewise formed from the food we have taken. A man in state of rest does\r\nnot perspire and breathe so much as the man at work; therefore he needs\r\nless food. If, on the other hand, a person works without taking food,\r\nthe perspiration and carbonic acid of the breath are formed from the\r\nmuscles of his body; for which reason he must greatly decrease, both in\r\nstrength and volume. We must bear in mind, however, that it is one of\r\nthe qualities of spirits to be decomposed in the body very easily into\r\nwater and carbonic acid; the water is then secreted in the form of\r\nperspiration; the carbonic acid, by exhalation. Thus, if a man works\r\nwithout food, he becomes reduced immediately, because perspiration and\r\nbreath are supplied from the flesh of his body; while if he drinks\r\nliquor, perspiration and breath are formed from the liquor itself,\r\ninstead of his body, which thus, partly at least, remains intact.\r\n\r\nThis is the solution of the great problem, viz., \"How can drunkards live\r\na long time on nothing but spirits, and, moreover, how can they work?\"\r\nWe know it now; liquor furnishes them the material for perspiration and\r\nbreath; and their body is not nearly so much taxed as would be the case,\r\nif they were to take no spirits at all. Since, then, the drunkard cannot\r\neat, and even if he could, would not be nourished, because food passes\r\nthrough him undigested, he must needs continue taking spirits even if he\r\nworks but little. Spirits help him at his work, and save his body from\r\nbeing consumed.\r\n\r\nThat spirits are no articles of food, has been known long; but it was\r\nnot known until recently, why spirits can be a substitute for food, or,\r\nmore correctly, a kind of _saving of food_.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, liquor is as deplorable as a substitute as it is fatal as\r\na means of saving. It is only calculated to entirely destroy the doomed\r\nman that uses it.\r\n\r\nNow, is it not more judicious to understand the reason why the drunkard\r\ncannot abstain from spirits, than to endeavor to reform him merely by\r\n\"prayer\" and stories about the \"devil in the alcohol?\" And is it not of\r\nthe highest importance to all, that the friends of humanity should take\r\ncare that the workman has good and healthy food, and that he be always\r\nable to earn enough, so as not to be obliged to replace bad food by\r\nliquor?\r\n\r\nThe workman who has nothing but potatoes to eat, is bound to become a\r\ndrunkard. This food is insufficient to afford him a proper quantity of\r\ncarbonic acid for the purpose of breathing; he therefore must draw for\r\nthis from his body, and, since he must needs work for his living, he\r\ntakes to spirits to save his body from being consumed. Many an \"Apostle\r\nof Temperance\" would, in a similar situation, act no better. For this\r\nreason let us all provide healthy food for the working class;\r\nintemperance will then greatly diminish.\r\n\r\nOwing to the importance of the subject we have spent much time over\r\n\"Breakfast,\" and the chapter on \"Spirits\" connected with the same; but\r\nwe could not help it; nay, we must ask our readers' pardon for\r\ncontinuing the subject. We propose to touch upon the sad consequences of\r\nintemperance, and desire to give the wives of the workmen a hint, by\r\nwhich they may succeed in checking the vice of their husbands and the\r\nmisfortune of their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF INTEMPERANCE AND ITS PREVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe digestion of the drunkard, as we have seen, is greatly impaired; the\r\nprocess of nutrition entirely changed. There is a change in the tissues\r\nof the interior of the body. The inner organs are encumbered by fat;\r\neven under the very skin, layers of fat are formed. It is this\r\nthat gives the drunkard that bloated appearance, which is very\r\ncharacteristic, and an evidence of the fact that the evil has reached a\r\nhigh stage. The stomach and the heart, the latter now much enlarged, are\r\nin an unnatural manner enveloped by fat. The action of the heart, at\r\ntimes immoderately increased, at times fearfully lessened, causes the\r\nblood to rush impetuously even to the finest blood-vessels of the skin,\r\nand to widen them considerably. Hence the reddened face of the drunkard.\r\nThe chest being overburdened with fat, the lungs are unable to expand\r\nproperly, and cannot therefore feed the blood with a sufficient quantity\r\nof oxygen, which would make the blood red; therefore we notice that the\r\ndrunkard's blood is of a bluish color; his nose is blue, his lips, and\r\noften his whole face, have a bluish hue. His mind is always clouded, the\r\nactivity of his nerves partly increased, partly weakened; his hands\r\nbegin to tremble, and become unsteady; soon his very feet refuse to\r\nserve. His breath is in the beginning saturated with alcohol, so that it\r\ncan be smelled; in a little while perspiration, nay the whole body, is\r\nimbued with alcohol, and cases have been known in which the body, on\r\ncoming in contact with fire, began to burn, as a wick dipped in\r\nalcohol, inflicting a terrible death upon the unfortunate victim. Many\r\ndie from apoplexy or paralysis of the brain, in most cases preceded by\r\ndelirium tremens. When it is considered that all this has its beginning\r\nonly in this, that the unhappy man has accustomed himself to promote\r\ndigestion by means of spirits--when this is well considered, no one will\r\nfind it strange that we wish to discourage from the use of liquor\r\neverybody, especially, however, those among the laboring classes who\r\nwork with fire. He who takes proper care of himself will always know how\r\nmuch of spirits he can take and when he must use it; then, and only\r\nthen, the enjoyment of the article in question cannot be considered a\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to present to our readers a general rule for temperance,\r\nyet we may here state a _principle_, the earnest observance of which we\r\nheartily recommend.\r\n\r\nThere are many people who say: \"I can stand a little liquor very well.\"\r\nThey mean by this that a little liquor does not intoxicate them. But\r\nthis is a dangerous standard to take. Not the possibility of\r\n_intoxication_, but the welfare of one's _stomach_ should be consulted.\r\nAs long as breakfast can be digested without the use of spirits there is\r\nno danger, even if after having eaten fat, bacon, etc., a desire for\r\nliquor should be felt; but when a person must needs take spirits after\r\nhis breakfast in order to be able to digest it, then the danger becomes\r\nimminent, and it is high time to consult a physician about this\r\nseemingly insignificant circumstance; it is best to tell him frankly the\r\nobject of the visit, viz., the desire to avoid the cheap remedy, the\r\nliquor. If the physician be the right man he will gladly spend advice\r\nand help.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, however, the housewife can do even more than the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe attentive housewife will notice the bad condition of her husband's\r\nstomach, and if she is judicious and wishes to be the benefactress of\r\nher household, she can, by a small sacrifice, easily prevent great\r\nmisfortune. Above all, she must bear in mind that only a well-fed\r\nhusband can support her and her children. It is a shame that we often\r\nsee a housewife treat her husband in this respect worse than a horse.\r\nThe owner of a horse knows that his horse cannot render him good service\r\nunless he feeds the animal well; why should woman not comprehend that\r\nman, her husband and provider, must be properly cared for? Let every\r\ngood wife bear in mind, that if her husband takes to drinking, it is\r\nmostly owing to her own bad and careless management of her kitchen; let\r\nher hasten to remedy the evil. Although it may cost her a sacrifice, yet\r\nshe owes it to herself and her family to provide her husband with a cup\r\nof broth, well seasoned with salt and pepper, when his stomach is\r\nweakened. At times she may surprise him with a favorite dish for\r\nbreakfast, which he will eat with a relish. And let her be especially\r\ncareful not to cause him grief or anger at his return home, but let her\r\nrather prepare for him a good savory dinner, for which he then will save\r\nall his appetite.\r\n\r\nSuch and similar insignificant acts of womanly kindness preserve often\r\nhusband, wife, and children from disgrace; while the dutiful wife earns\r\nthe esteem and gratitude of her family and of her country. This is a\r\nmerit which in course of time will be duly rewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDINNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wish to speak now of dinner, the principal meal of the day. Here,\r\ntoo, we shall take for standard neither the unhappy poor, who must eat\r\nwhat little he can obtain; nor the opulent rich, who finds a pleasure in\r\neating what others cannot obtain. We shall take for base the plain\r\nhousehold of the citizen, who takes healthy meals in order to strengthen\r\nhim for renewed activity.\r\n\r\nWhat may have been the reason for putting the principal meal in the\r\nmiddle of the day?\r\n\r\nIt was done for the reason that eating, too, is a labor; a labor which\r\nrequires rest. Now bodily fatigue and appetite constantly keep pace with\r\neach other; they manifest themselves in the body in intervals of three\r\nor four hours. Since, then, we must rest at noon from the fatigue of the\r\nmorning's labor, it is best for us to use this time of rest for our\r\ndinner; all the more so as the labor of eating ought not to be performed\r\nduring manual labor. And because just at the middle of the day we rest\r\nfrom our labor and prepare ourselves for the afternoon work, it is\r\nnatural that we should eat our principal meal at that time.\r\n\r\nBut this meal needs to be prepared carefully. The housewife is chained\r\nto the kitchen, because this meal is distinguished from others\r\nprincipally in this, that it is usually taken warm.\r\n\r\nThe question arises in the first place, Why must food be cooked? Is it\r\nnot more natural to take the food as nature gives it to us? Why does man\r\neat nothing raw except fruit? Why does he take such pains to grind,\r\nbake, boil, fry, etc., while the animal can live without all this?\r\nAgain, whence does it come, that man is so very dainty in regard to\r\neating and drinking, and that he uses an infinite variety of articles of\r\nfood, as does no other creature in the world? Are there not animals that\r\nlive on meat only, and others that live only on plants? Why, then, does\r\nman need mixed food, that is, partly meat and partly vegetable food?\r\n\r\nTo all these questions there is but one answer.\r\n\r\nNature herself has pointed this out to man; and experience, the natural\r\ninstructor of mankind, has taught man how he can do best what nature\r\nwishes him to do.\r\n\r\nThe human stomach is so constituted that it can digest but very little\r\nof raw food. Just as the nutritive part of the pea is enclosed by a\r\n_hull_, so in every organic food the nutritive element proper is\r\ncontained in a hull, called _cell_. The nutritive element of the potato,\r\nfor example--the starch--is enclosed in millions of small cells, which\r\nare indigestible for our stomach. By means of good magnifying glasses,\r\nthese cells, invisible to the naked eye, may be plainly seen. If the\r\npotato were eaten raw, these cells, together with the nutritive element\r\nin them, would leave the body unchanged. But if the potato is boiled,\r\nfried, or baked, the cells, by their expansion from the heat, burst, and\r\nthus allow the starch to be free. Now, while animals have been given a\r\ndigestive apparatus strong enough to dissolve the hardest\r\ncells--pigeons, for example, swallow and are able to digest raw\r\npease--man has been endowed with intelligence which enables him to\r\nprepare his food artificially.\r\n\r\nCooking, therefore, is as natural to man as the act of chewing; for\r\nchewing, the crushing of food with the teeth, on the part of animals\r\nthat live on plants, is nothing but the tearing asunder of cells.\r\nAnimals that have no teeth, birds for example, possess immensely strong\r\npowers of digestion. It would be as unnatural for the ox, who has good\r\nteeth to crush peas with, to swallow them entire as the pigeon does, as\r\nit were unnatural for man to take pease raw while he has the means of\r\ncooking them.\r\n\r\nWe often call _art_ what really is _nature_ in man; for his mental gifts\r\nare natural to him; women, therefore, when they perform the art of\r\ncooking, practise a natural art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nNECESSITY FOR VARIETY IN FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet no one believe that it is from mere daintiness that man is\r\nfastidious in regard to food, and that he lives on a great variety of\r\nvictuals.\r\n\r\nThe human body is the transformed food which he has eaten. It is quite\r\ncorrect that man can live on bread and water a long time; but man's\r\nnature is so varied, his qualities are of such numerous kinds; his\r\ncharacter, his impulses and passions, his wishes and desires, his\r\nthoughts and labors, are so infinitely varified and so much exposed to\r\nchange, that man's body, the bearer of all these elements, must also be\r\nformed from material of the most diversified kind.\r\n\r\nIt is a common observation that animals which take uniform food are very\r\nmuch poorer in mind than those animals that feed upon richer and more\r\nvarious kinds of food. Nay, it has even been proved that the character,\r\nthe whole nature of an animal may be completely changed by its food.\r\nVery properly, therefore, does the genial naturalist, Moleschott, begin\r\nhis excellent treatise, \"Our Articles of Food,\" with the following\r\nwords: \"Food has made the wild-cat our house-cat;\" thus showing that\r\nfood may completely change the character of an animal, and more, it may\r\neven change the animal's body. And if civilized man is a being of a\r\nhigher order, more spiritual and more intellectual than the savage, we\r\ncan ascribe it to no other cause than the impulse his food gives him,\r\nnot to sink down to the savage, but, by varying his food as much as\r\npossible, to bestow upon his body many superior qualities.\r\n\r\nNature herself has undeniably impressed upon man, that she wishes him to\r\ntake nourishment of different kinds.\r\n\r\nThose animals that live upon plants, and such as feed solely on meat,\r\nare entirely different from each other in regard to their bodies. The\r\nteeth of the former, the herbivorous, are broad and flat on the top,\r\nlike our molar teeth. They serve to crush vegetable fibres and to chew\r\nthe cells which contain the nutritive element; while the other class,\r\nthe carnivorous, have but pointed teeth, like our eye-teeth, to tear\r\ntheir food asunder. The stomach of the herbivorous is also different; it\r\ncomprises several divisions which have various functions. For blood is\r\nnot so readily obtained from vegetable as from animal food, which itself\r\ncontains ready-made blood. Herbivorous animals are for the greater part\r\nruminators, that is, their food passes from the first division of the\r\nstomach back into the mouth, where it is masticated a second time; this\r\nis called \"ruminating.\" With the carnivorous this is not the case.\r\nFinally, the intestines of the herbivorous are long, because there the\r\nfinal change of the food into blood takes place; a process requiring\r\nmore time with vegetable food than with animal. For the same reason the\r\nintestines of the carnivorous are short, the blood to be formed being\r\nalready present there.\r\n\r\nConsidering the fact that man has sharp teeth in front, at both sides\r\npointed teeth, and in the rear of them molars; that his stomach is\r\nadapted to the digestion of both vegetable and animal food, and that his\r\nintestine is so constituted as to be able to digest and change into\r\nblood both kinds, we can no longer entertain any doubt that nature\r\nherself bids him to change his food constantly, and to take in such as\r\nis of the most varied kind. If, in addition to that, we recollect that\r\nexclusive animal food renders an animal wild, quick, and sly, while\r\nvegetable food makes it tame, enduring, and slow in mind, it will not\r\nbe denied that food exercises great influence upon the nature of a\r\nbeing, and it will now be readily understood that it would be a sin, if\r\nman were to be forced to take uniform nourishment.\r\n\r\nThe example of the cat is very instructive; it teaches us that change of\r\nfood has transformed her into another being, mentally as well as bodily.\r\nThe wild-cat has short intestines and is an animal of prey; the tame cat\r\nhas long intestines, and betrays her old character only now and then by\r\ncunning and slyness. We also learn from this, that variety of food\r\nproduces variety of bodily and mental qualities; and lastly, it may be\r\ninferred that nature, having fitted man for this variety and given him\r\nsuch diversity of mental capacities, wishes also that his food be well\r\nselected and of the greatest variety.\r\n\r\nThese short remarks enable us to pass to the principal dishes\r\nthemselves; first to those constituting the principal meal of the day,\r\nthe dinner, for which very justly the greatest variety of food is\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nBROTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoup, meat, and vegetables are the principal dishes of a plain household\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nWhen examining this more closely, we find the selection so judicious\r\nthat we may well admire the tact of woman, who discovered it long before\r\nscience did.\r\n\r\nThe good tact of woman does even more yet; it selects the dishes in such\r\na manner that they mutually compensate for their wants, that is, that\r\neach offers to the body what is wanting in the others.\r\n\r\nThe principal dishes composing a meal are divided into fat-producing and\r\nflesh-producing ones. All farinaceous diet provides the body with fat;\r\nall albumen substances, with flesh. To support the body, however, it is\r\nalso necessary to give it salt, from which bones, hair, nails and teeth\r\nmay be formed.\r\n\r\nOur domestic wives, indeed, look to all that. Long before scientific men\r\nhad investigated the necessity for nutriment of the kind, all-providing\r\nwoman had arranged culinary matters so as to be able to satisfy all the\r\ndemands of nature. But not only the proper selection of articles of\r\nfood,--the way and manner also in which they are cooked and served, are\r\nof prime importance to a proper nutrition; and we maintain that\r\nhousehold fare may justly be regarded as a guide for scientific\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nA judicious housewife will first of all place meat on the fire, to have\r\ngood soup and well-cooked meat. She will prefer beef to any other kind,\r\nbecause it contains but little fat and much albumen and animal fibre;\r\nfor this reason it makes better broth, and still preserves strength\r\nenough to be a healthy, strength-giving dish.\r\n\r\nBesides, meat, by cooking, becomes more nutritive, inasmuch as its\r\ndigestibility is greatly facilitated. One of the most important tasks of\r\nthe cook consists in promoting one's digestion; in other words, in\r\nsaving the stomach labor. Flesh in its raw state keeps its nutritive\r\nelements shut up in cells which are gluey. By boiling it, the gelatine\r\nbecomes soft and mixes with the water; hence it comes that broth is\r\nglutinous, and, if allowed to cool, becomes thick and like jelly. This\r\nsubstance is in part very nourishing; it is often obtained from bones\r\nand cartilages, and then sold under the name of \"bouillon-tables,\"\r\nwhich, when boiled in water, make a tolerably good soup. Thus we see\r\nthat the first object of all cooking is the dissolving of the cellular\r\ntissues. Not before this is done do we obtain the real nutritive element\r\nof the flesh, which then is taken up by the stomach all the easier,\r\ninasmuch as it has thus been well prepared to be easily changed into\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nBut before the meat reaches the boiling-point, albumen is separated from\r\nits surface and mixes with the water; it is this which gives broth its\r\nreal strength and nutritive power. Afterwards, when the water boils,\r\nthis albumen condenses; the broth becomes white, as if containing the\r\nwhite of eggs; from the inside of the meat flows continually more and\r\nmore albumen into the broth, and makes it stronger and stronger. During\r\nthis time, moreover, the fat parts of the meat melt, and its salts are\r\nalso dissolved in the broth; hence a great deal of the most nutritive\r\nparts of the meat goes over into the broth; and although much of the\r\nstrength of the meat has been withdrawn, still there is much of it left\r\nyet, and the meat has now become easier to masticate and easier to be\r\ndigested. We need not add that a sufficient quantity of salt is thrown\r\ninto the soup, which quickly dissolves in the water; but in the same\r\ndegree that the meat excretes a part of its ingredients and gives them\r\nto the water, in the same measure does the meat absorb salt. By this it\r\nbecomes not only more tasteful and digestible, but also more nutritive.\r\nIt was not until recently that the importance of salt as a nutritive was\r\nrecognized; this cannot be otherwise, for the tissues of the human body,\r\nas well as its blood and cartilages, need salt for their formation and\r\nsupport. Who does not know that every farmer gives his cattle salt from\r\ntime to time, so as to improve their strength and general health?\r\n\r\nOur readers will readily understand now, that the weaker the broth the\r\nstronger must be the meat, and _vice versa_. It often occurs that we\r\ncare less to have good broth than good beef. In such cases we must not\r\nput the meat into cold water, but into boiling water. So soon as the\r\nmeat is thrown into boiling water, the albumen on the outside\r\ncoagulates, surrounding the whole piece as it were with a hard crust,\r\nwhich does not permit the nutritive parts of the inside to escape. The\r\nsame effect is produced by the roasting of the meat in an oven, although\r\nhere it is not covered by water. It is more judicious, however, and more\r\nimportant for the household, to make good broth, and to let dinner\r\ncommence with it.\r\n\r\nFor he who has been at work all the forenoon, needs such food at first\r\nas will not cause his stomach too much labor; and soup is that food. Let\r\nevery good housewife bear this in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS BEST TO BE PUT INTO SOUP?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question will be \"Something farinaceous,\" and,\r\nindeed, no better answer could be given.\r\n\r\nBroth contains gluten and albumen, both of which are changed in the body\r\ninto flesh. Not only the animal part of our body, but chiefly the\r\nactive, working part of it requires nutriment that can be transformed\r\npartly into fat. Breath and perspiration, so unavoidable in labor, are\r\nsupported by means of fat in our body. This explains why fat people\r\nperspire more than others; why fat people get out of breath sooner than\r\nlean persons; why the other sex, who are more apt to become fat than\r\nmen, perspire more; and why children, because they run about much, and\r\nhence need more breath and perspiration, usually prefer bread to meat.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, broth, which contains only such ingredients as are\r\nintended to produce muscle-fibres, may well be mixed with something\r\nfarinaceous, which should be thrown in and boiled with the soup, in\r\norder to promote the formation of fat in the body. It matters little\r\nwhat may be chosen for the purpose--flour, groats, barley, rice, or\r\npotato, or any other article; provided always it contains starch; for\r\nthis becomes saccharine even when boiling; it changes in the body into\r\nacid of milk, and lastly into fat. Perhaps it is advisable to use that\r\nwhich contains most starch. Rice, for example, has much of it; probably\r\nthis accounts for the fact that lively children are very fond of it. A\r\nhundred pounds of rice include eighty-five of starch; while a hundred\r\npounds of wheat contain but about seventy-four pounds. A judicious\r\nhousekeeper will know very well that a less quantity is taken of rice\r\nthan of flour. The various kinds of farina and barley possess but about\r\none-half the starch of rice; and potatoes are so poor in that, that five\r\npounds of potatoes yield no more starch than one pound of rice. All this\r\nis a matter of great importance to our housewives.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of soup-material lies, however, not always in its great\r\nnutritive capacity, but very often in the facility with which it may be\r\ncooked. Thus we cannot boil rice in the broth itself; it must, to loosen\r\nits cells properly, be boiled first in water; this takes a little over\r\nhalf an hour, and requires of course a place on the fire, and hence more\r\nfuel. The cell of the farina or pearl-barley, on the other hand, was\r\ncrushed already by the grinding; therefore it needs but little\r\nattention, and may be boiled in the broth itself without any loss of\r\ntime. When making scientific observations on food, such circumstances\r\nmust not be overlooked; for time and fuel cost money, and may, in the\r\neyes of practical housewives, raise the price of the article too much;\r\nwhile to a scientific man the same article may appear very cheap.\r\n\r\nThere are other viands which, though not very nutritive, are yet very\r\npopular and in common use. As an example of this class, we may give the\r\npotato.\r\n\r\nThat the latter is poor in starch, was stated above. Its extensive use\r\nis surprising, when we consider, that, according to calculation, the\r\nlittle nutriment obtained from the potato is paid more highly for than\r\nthat of flour. And yet there is good reason for the extensive use of the\r\narticle. Its preparation, in the first place, is an easy one, especially\r\nwhen the potato is boiled whole, without being peeled. This is a great\r\nconvenience for the housewife, who, besides the time devoted to the\r\nhouse, needs time for work from the proceeds of which she may support\r\nherself. She values, therefore, any dish which can be prepared with\r\nlittle expense of time and money; more than any other article may the\r\npotato be said to possess this quality. From it a meal can be prepared\r\nin half an hour, and the cook need not watch it constantly; potatoes do\r\nnot boil over. Besides all this, there is another advantage, and it is\r\nthis which makes it a favorite even with the rich; already, when\r\nboiling, its starch is transformed into sugar, giving the potato a more\r\npleasant flavor than any other cheap dish can be said to have. How\r\neasily the potato starch is converted into sugar may be noticed best in\r\nhalf-frozen potatoes, because there the cells containing the starch\r\nburst during the process of freezing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nLEGUMINOUS VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greens which we put in soup cannot be considered nutriment, but\r\nrather a kind of spice, and perhaps also as a means of giving us the\r\nbenefit of some medicinal qualities which they in part contain. We will\r\ndwell no longer on this subject, but proceed to the most nutritive\r\narticles of food we use, viz., the leguminous vegetables.\r\n\r\nPease, beans, and lentils are so extremely rich in fat and\r\nmuscle-forming elements, that in this regard they excel bread and are\r\nalmost on a level with meat. No wonder, therefore, that they are very\r\nfavorite articles if well cooked, when we consider the fact that they\r\nare so very cheap. Where people are too poor to buy meat every day,\r\nlegumes must not be found wanting. They play a great part in barracks\r\nand prisons; and in order to keep pace with the immense progress\r\ngastronomical science has made, one of the above-named articles ought to\r\nbe used in those establishments on all days on which there is no meat.\r\n\r\nThe element common to all three is called legumine. It is richer in\r\nstarch than bread and contains nearly three times more of it than the\r\npotato. Partly legumes contain also ready-made sugar; this may be tasted\r\nin green pease. Besides this, their flesh-forming parts are in greater\r\nquantity than those of other plants, while their quantity of water is\r\nless, and it is therefore not advisable to take them dry. New pease and\r\nbeans have, moreover, the advantage of being eatable together with their\r\nhulls and pods, as these, when yet green, contain likewise sugar and\r\nstarch.\r\n\r\nBut we must recommend, above all, not to eat the hulls of dried legumes.\r\nThis may be avoided if, when boiled, the cook crushes them and strains\r\nthem through a coarse sieve, by which process the hulls are left. If\r\nthis is not done, we run the danger of disturbing the functions of the\r\nbody, inasmuch as these dry hulls are dissolved neither by the saliva of\r\nthe mouth nor the gastric juice of the stomach.\r\n\r\nMost every one that once in his life had culinary labor to perform, is\r\nacquainted with the fact that the cooking of legumes is often\r\naccompanied by a peculiar circumstance. Pease sometimes may boil by the\r\nhour without getting soft; it happens even that young pease, soft by\r\nnature, become harder and harder by boiling; while, at other times, the\r\nsame pease have become soft and burst open after but half an hour's\r\ncooking. The reason of this lies not in the pease, but in the water they\r\nare boiled in. Our housewives undoubtedly know, from the experience of\r\ntheir wash-days, that there is hard water and soft. Soap, when put in\r\nhard water, breaks into small pieces, while it dissolves in soft water\r\ncompletely and forms a slimy liquid. Science has solved this mystery:\r\nspring-water contains lime, which combines chemically with the fat in\r\nsoap and forms with it an insoluble element; while rain-water contains\r\nlittle or no lime, and therefore dissolves soap. The same is the case in\r\nregard to the legumine. The lime in spring-water, which settles on the\r\nbottom of vessels as sediment, combines with some constituent parts of\r\nthe pea and forms a very hard, indigestible body; rain-water, however,\r\ndissolves legumine completely.\r\n\r\nIt must now appear evident to all, that much fuel and nutritive element\r\nis gained by cooking pease, beans, and lentils in soft water. To comfort\r\nthose who, on the plea of uncleanliness, are opposed to rain or cistern\r\nwater, we desire to state that rain-water when poured through linen or\r\ncotton cloth is not in the least impure; especially if it be allowed to\r\nstand quietly for a few hours and then have the scum removed from its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nPease, beans, and lentils produce in the healthy body blood, flesh,\r\nmilk, and fat. By their being strained through a coarse sieve they lose\r\nsuch disagreeable qualities as, for example, the bloating they produce\r\nin the body, which makes them very unpopular with many.\r\n\r\nAnother great advantage in leguminous vegetables lies in this, that they\r\ncontain phosphorus, a principle needed for the formation and\r\npreservation of the bones and brain; therefore we may justly maintain\r\nthat legumine is good for the body and mind both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMEAT AND VEGETABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an old German habit to consider meat and vegetables as belonging\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn the common kinds of vegetables there is very little nutriment. Nearly\r\nnine-tenths of the weight of cabbages and other varieties consist of\r\nwater. There is therefore but little left for nutriment proper, as, for\r\nexample, vegetable albumen, gluten, vegetable fat, starch, and sugar. It\r\nis only such vegetables as turnips, etc., that contain much sugar, for\r\nwhich reason they are well adapted for children and convalescents. In\r\nfine, if nutriment alone were considered, the enjoyment of our common\r\nvegetables would be nothing but a luxury.\r\n\r\nIn truth, however, they possess elements which make them very beneficial\r\nto man, if he takes them together with meat. They contain organic\r\nacids--like fruit, which for this reason is so universally liked--and\r\nhave the quality of preserving in a state of dissolution the soluble\r\nalbumen of the meat. Thus they save much labor to the digestive organs,\r\nand accelerate the transition of meat into chyle. Hence the well-known\r\nfact, that after dinner, though we can eat nothing more, yet we like to\r\ntaste some good raw fruit, or cooked fruit of any kind. Vegetables are\r\ntaken for a similar purpose, and are therefore very healthy when eaten\r\nwith meat.\r\n\r\nBut why is it that our housewives often serve vegetables _before_ they\r\ndo meat, and fruit _after_ the meat?\r\n\r\nVery likely they themselves do not know why, as is the case so often;\r\nyet they act here, as in many other things, with wise instinct. Fruit\r\ncontains organic acid, which, in a ready-made condition, is very\r\nbeneficial to us; it needs only to be taken up by the stomach. We do\r\nwell, therefore, if we take fruit after the meat, and allow digestion to\r\ngo on with it. From vegetables, however, this acid is only produced in\r\nthe stomach, and during the process of digestion. If taken before meat,\r\nthe acid may promote the digestion of the meat; while if it is taken\r\nafter the meat, the acid comes much too late to be of any benefit. This\r\nexplains the fact, that vegetables in which this acid has been produced\r\nby fermentation--as is the case, for example, with sour-crout--are\r\nusually taken together with meat.\r\n\r\nAnother great advantage of vegetables is, that they are rich in mineral\r\nsalts necessary for the health of the body. There are ingredients in the\r\nvarious kinds of vegetables, of which it may scarcely be believed that\r\nthey can be eaten, for they belong to the metals and metal combinations;\r\nas, for example, chlorine, iron, potassium, and natron; these play an\r\nimportant part in the body. It is, therefore, not surprising to us that\r\na judicious physician will more often prescribe a good vegetable than\r\nmedicine; and one ought to be thankful to him if he sends people more to\r\nthe market than to the drug-store. There are, indeed, many diseases\r\nsuccessfully cured by such organical remedies, which only nature knows\r\nhow to prepare. To mention but one remedy, spinage, so highly beneficial\r\nto children and young girls of very pale appearance. Their\r\ngreen-sickness takes origin from a want of iron in the blood. Though\r\nevery physician is able to prescribe medicine which contains iron, yet\r\nthe effect of such artificial inorganic remedies is often very doubtful;\r\nwhile spinage itself contains iron, and therefore offers a better\r\norganic remedy, and food.\r\n\r\nMeat and vegetables are sufficient for the body. There is not need of\r\nmuch meat. From six to eight ounces a day constitutes the quantity\r\nsufficient for a man. Meat and vegetables compensate each other's wants;\r\nthe former is poor in water, the latter rich; vegetables are wanting in\r\nalbumen, which is found abundantly in meat. This happy circumstance is\r\nfavorable to the formation of that mixture of elements essential to the\r\npreservation of the body.\r\n\r\nHousehold fare, according to what we have seen, is precisely what it\r\nought to be, and does not, as some people are inclined to think, result\r\nsolely from the whims of the housewives. Thus is proved again what we\r\nhave said above, viz., that the natural instinct and tact of woman have,\r\nby long years of practice, been guided by a better and more practical\r\ncourse than science itself.\r\n\r\nThere are some other important articles of food, but we must keep them\r\nfor \"Supper;\" and our readers will no doubt be very glad if we conclude\r\nthis chapter, and treat in the next one the question,\r\n\r\n\"Is it good to take a little nap after dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE NAP AFTER DINNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old adage says, \"After dinner thou shalt either rest or walk a\r\nthousand steps.\" Habit, however, has modified this very much; for people\r\nnowadays neither rest nor walk; but, if they can, they lie down and\r\nslumber. Now, it is true that sleep does not belong to the articles of\r\nfood. We might despatch the question of the nap after dinner here at\r\nonce; yet, if it has any influence upon the digestion of food, it is of\r\nenough importance to merit a few words.\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned before, that eating and digestion are a labor. To many\r\nit may be the most pleasant labor, to others even the only labor of\r\ntheir lives; but be this as it may, it is certainly a labor for all and\r\nevery one; and it is important that during the process quiet should be\r\nenjoyed. He who thinks he gains by not taking enough time for eating, or\r\nhe who takes his dinner while working or moving about, loses actually\r\nmore than he even thinks of winning. The activity without disturbs\r\nseriously the activity within. The perspiration on the surface of the\r\nbody withdraws moisture from the inside of the body to such an extent as\r\nto diminish even the saliva in the mouth, so necessary to digestion.\r\nHave not all of you had the experience, that when fatigued you feel\r\ndryness in the mouth; that you feel as if a piece of dry bread would not\r\npass down, but remain in your throat? And as with the saliva, it is with\r\nthe other digestive fluids; if there is any want of them, the food we\r\nhave taken lies in the stomach like stone.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore desirable to take a short rest before dinner, not to\r\nperform any kind of labor whatever during the same, and, above all, not\r\nto exercise the body immediately after dinner. Eating is an inward work,\r\nand should not be accompanied by any labor without. As an additional\r\nproof of what we said above, it may be stated that, as probably many of\r\nour readers know already, even in the hottest summer, perspiration\r\ndiminishes after dinner. This will convince all, that when the digestive\r\napparatus is at work, the outer organs ought to be at rest. Once more,\r\nthen: before and after dinner we need rest, and it is this rest which\r\nrenders us indisposed to labor and makes us feel sleepy.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we must take but a short slumber. Those who have\r\naccustomed themselves to sleep after dinner, feel that half an hour's\r\nslumber is all that is needed, and that they even feel weary if they\r\nhave slept longer.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this is, the process of digestion is properly carried on\r\nchemically by the food, being dissolved through the gastric juice. This\r\ndigestion, however, is greatly promoted by the motions of the stomach,\r\nwhich tosses the food about from one side to the other, mixing it\r\nentirely, and finally making a large ball of it, whose various\r\ningredients are, as it were, fused together. This process needs rest on\r\nour part; during it sleep is sweet and agreeable. But for the further\r\ndigestion of food, energy is needed, which we have not during that\r\nsleep; therefore its want makes our prolonged sleep uneasy, or renders\r\nour digestion imperfect. This latter may be felt by every one who goes\r\nto bed with a full stomach. His sleep during the first hour is\r\nundisturbed and pleasant, because it is favorable to the first stage of\r\ndigestion. But after that, sleep is very uneasy; weariness and\r\ncomplaints about bad digestion follow, and the imprudent person rises\r\nnext morning with headache, coated tongue, and indigestion in the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nFrom what has preceded we may conclude, that a short nap after dinner is\r\nconducive to good health; while if taken too long, it will produce the\r\ncontrary effect. Dizziness in the head and fetid taste in the mouth are\r\nsure signs of one's having overslept one's self, and he who has been so\r\nimprudent must animate his system--not by liquor, but with a glass of\r\nfresh water; or he must, if he feels very heavy, wash with very cold\r\nwater. For this is the moment when digestion needs activity more than\r\nanything else; the above symptoms are the indications, and man should\r\nconsider them as the summons of nature, who calls to him, \"Thou hast\r\neaten and reposed; go, then, to thy labor; this is the time!\"\r\n\r\nLet every one obey her call, and there will be less sickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nWATER AND BEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the forenoon a general desire for food is felt, while in the\r\nafternoon thirst is more common, in which case the best and most natural\r\nbeverage should always be water.\r\n\r\nProperly speaking, water is no article of food, if by that term we\r\nunderstand only animal and vegetable matter. Water is no organic, but a\r\nmere chemical agent. But if man were to consume no water he would\r\nperish. Therefore water is essentially necessary to man, although it\r\ndoes not satisfy his appetite; for it serves to liquify our food in the\r\nbody, and our blood must contain a greater quantity of water than is\r\nfurnished us by food, although this itself contains much water.\r\n\r\nWithout water there can be neither digestion nor nutrition, nor\r\nformation of blood, nor secretion. Furthermore, it is remarkable that\r\nthe most active of the human organs, the brain and muscles, contain the\r\nmost water; we are therefore obliged, although we are aware of its\r\ncontaining no nutritious elements, to call it a nutritive; all the more,\r\nsince it is well known that we can be longer without food than without\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThis element plays a great part in the body; it is used in three ways.\r\nIn the first place, the ingredients of water, hydrogen and oxygen,\r\ncombine with the food, and effect its digestion. The starch which we eat\r\nin farinaceous and vegetable food cannot without water be converted into\r\nsugar. And the latter being transformed into fat, we should have no fat\r\nif we took no water, though it may seem strange that water should make\r\nus fat.\r\n\r\nAnd there is the second task, viz., the preservation of all the fluids\r\nnecessary to our body. This, also, is performed by water; and as they\r\nare excreted their loss is compensated for by water. We lose it\r\nconstantly by breathing, perspiring, and urinating; therefore we must\r\ncontinually take it anew. Those who perspire and breathe much, as, for\r\nexample, workmen or foot-travellers, must take it in greater quantities.\r\n\r\nThe third reason of its importance lies in this, that it gives us much\r\nof the salts and other ingredients that are dissolved in it, and which\r\nthe human body needs for its support. Those are wrong, therefore, who\r\nprefer cistern or distilled water to spring-water; the former being, as\r\nit were artificially, free from all metallic and mineral parts which are\r\nso beneficial to our health; while spring-water contains them in\r\nabundance, and ought, therefore, to be taken in preference even to the\r\npurest rain-water.\r\n\r\nBut one of the most excellent qualities of water is, that one can\r\nscarcely ever drink too much of it. If but for a moment in the stomach,\r\nit is absorbed there and goes immediately into the blood. From this\r\narises its rapid cooling quality; which, however, may become very\r\ndangerous when one is heated. There is but one case in which water is\r\nnot readily absorbed by the stomach; when it contains salts that make it\r\nheavier than blood, for example, Glauber's salt and bitter-salt. It\r\npasses then into the intestinal canal, and produces here--partly as\r\nliquid, partly by its salts exciting the nerves of the intestines--that\r\nmedicinal effect for which it is famous. Many water-cures, especially\r\nthose applied in cases of abdominal diseases, are of similar effects.\r\n\r\nCommon water, however, which is immediately transmitted to the blood,\r\neffects by this accelerated secretion of perspiration, respiration and\r\nurine; this constitutes the beneficial effects of water-cures, where a\r\nglass of water often produces better results than a bottle of medicine.\r\n\r\nIf we can control our thirst until several hours after dinner have\r\npassed, a glass of beer will be a welcome beverage to us. Beer contains\r\nnutriment; it includes more or less albumen, sugar, gluten, hops, and\r\nalcohol. Owing to the variety in its fermentation and manufacture, we\r\nhave many kinds of beer, such as, for example, porter, ale, and, above\r\nall others, the lager-beer.\r\n\r\nGood beer--that is, beer well brewed and containing all the ingredients\r\nthis beverage generally does contain--is, very justly, often given to\r\nnurses and mothers, because it assimilates easily and very rapidly. It\r\nis a kind of soup; one may take it when a person is too heated or\r\nfatigued to eat a regular meal. There is a kind of beer that contains\r\nmore hops, and is therefore very bitter; it is very good for the\r\nstomach. The Bavarian beer, when genuine, contains more alcohol than the\r\nother, which gives it the advantages of liquor without its\r\ndisadvantages. It therefore does not satisfy one's appetite, but, on the\r\ncontrary, tends to increase it; thus it is more adapted to be taken at\r\nbreakfast and supper. Another kind of beer, called white-beer, contains\r\nmore sugar and oxygen; it may, for this reason, supply the place of\r\nsugar, and Seltzer-water, and is recommended to all those who need\r\nSeidlitz powders.\r\n\r\nIn another part of this work we shall perhaps speak more about the\r\nusefulness of beer. To-day we must pray our readers to be satisfied with\r\nwhat we have said about it; we shall now speak about supper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nSUPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo time of the day is more pleasant than the evening hours after the\r\nday's work is over; there is a solemn calm and quiet in them which\r\ncharms both soul and body.\r\n\r\nThis time of ease and rest must not be disturbed on our part by\r\noverburdening the stomach. We eat only for the purpose of compensating\r\nfor the loss experienced through our work; we should not eat more than\r\nis necessary to supply the strength lost; in other words, to give us\r\nsufficient strength to continue our labor. And as the day's work is\r\nfinished, there being not much work before us, we need not take much\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nWhen glancing at a sleeping person and noticing his long breathing and\r\nincreased perspiration, one may be led to the belief that he loses much\r\noxygen and water during his sleep; that therefore we must provide\r\nourselves abundantly with food before retiring to bed. This is, however,\r\na mistake. The breath of a sleeping person is long and deep, but very\r\nslow; and his perspiring does not cause any great loss of water, but\r\ncomes rather from this, that one's body during the night is more\r\nprotected by covers and closed windows, etc., from draft which dries our\r\nevaporation, and therefore prevents perspiration in day-time. During\r\nsleep we need even less of bodily strength than through the day; for\r\nthis reason we feel no hunger in the night, and, in spite of the long\r\nfasting, no fatigue in the morning.\r\n\r\nFrom this we conclude that supper should not be a meal for the night,\r\nbut merely for the last hours of the day. It should be no meal\r\n_praenumerando_, but _postnumerando_!\r\n\r\nIt is therefore best to choose but light dishes, which, if we wish to\r\nrest well, must be easily digested, and eaten at least two or three\r\nhours before bed-time.\r\n\r\nFor healthy people a warm supper is unnecessary; our dinner is taken\r\nwarm for the purpose only of keeping the gluten and fat of the food\r\nliquid; as this kind of food, however, is not proper for supper, we need\r\nnot take it at all in the evening. If we do, it is but an additional\r\nburden to the housewife, who surely has enough trouble and labor in the\r\nkitchen during the day. He who is not satisfied with a piece of bread\r\nand butter and a glass of beer, may eat a piece of cheese besides; but\r\nit must be no other kind than sour cheese--the Germans call it\r\n_Schmierkaese_--common cheese being too heavy for night because of its\r\ncontaining fat. This sour cheese, whether soft or hardened, is easily\r\ndigested; it even excites the stomach like spice, especially if you eat\r\nit with caraway seeds, and thus promotes the secretion of gastric juice.\r\nThe other kind of cheese is, for no other reason than that, often eaten\r\nafter dinner; for, though taken by itself scarcely digestible, if eaten\r\nin very small quantity, it increases by its action upon the stomach, the\r\nquantity of gastric juice there, and, therefore, promotes digestion in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nShould we, however, for one reason or the other, insist upon having a\r\nmore substantial supper, then let us take soft-boiled eggs. The\r\nnutritive quality of eggs is equivalent to that of meat. They unite all\r\ngood sides of the meat; nay, we may say here, that the most nourishing\r\npart in meat is nothing but egg-white, or, as we call it, \"albumen.\"\r\n\r\nWe recommend soft-boiled eggs, because hard ones are difficult to\r\ndigest. They are best prepared by boiling, if the water is allowed to\r\nboil first and the eggs put in afterwards. The reason of this is, that\r\nthe boiling water hardens the outer part of the egg very rapidly,\r\nforming a thick crust, which prevents the heat of the boiling water from\r\npenetrating farther.\r\n\r\nIt is a custom of our country to take tea in the evening. Tea is no\r\narticle of food, but it possesses the qualities of coffee; it warms the\r\nblood, increases the activity of the heart, and produces a certain\r\nfreshness of the mind, which is a good remedy against ennui and\r\nsleepiness in a company or party.\r\n\r\nAnd since we are speaking of ennui and sleepiness, we think it advisable\r\nto close our present subject, \"The Articles of Food for the People,\" and\r\nwe part from our readers with the full conviction that they will enjoy\r\ntheir real \"articles of food\" much better than they have relished these\r\nscientific conversations about them.",
