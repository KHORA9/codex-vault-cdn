PREFACE\r\n\r\nOf the increasing success and widening popularity of the elementary\r\nscience series written chiefly in the seclusion of Sérignan by the\r\ngifted French naturalist who was destined to give that obscure hamlet a\r\ndistinction hardly inferior to the renown enjoyed by Maillane since the\r\ndays of Mistral, it is unnecessary at this late date to say more than a\r\nword in passing. The extraordinary vividness and animation of his style\r\namply justified his early belief in the possibility of making the truths\r\nof science more fascinating to young readers, and to all readers, than\r\nthe fabrications of fiction. As Dr. Legros has said in his biography[1]\r\nof Fabre, “He was indeed convinced that even in early childhood it was\r\npossible for both boys and girls to learn and to love many subjects\r\nwhich had hitherto never been proposed; and in particular that Natural\r\nHistory which to him was a book in which all the world might read, but\r\nthat university methods had reduced to a tedious and useless study in\r\nwhich the letter ‘killed the life.’”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  “Fabre, Poet of Science.” By Dr. C. V. Legros. New York: The Century\r\n  Co.\r\n\r\nThe young in heart and the pure in heart of whatever age will find\r\nthemselves drawn to this incomparable story-teller, this reverent\r\nrevealer of the awe-inspiring secrets of nature, this “Homer of the\r\ninsects.” The identity of the “Uncle Paul,” who in this book and others\r\nof the series plays the story-teller’s part, is not hard to guess; and\r\nthe young people who gather about him to listen to his true stories from\r\nwood and field, from brook and hilltop, from distant ocean and adjacent\r\nmillpond, are, without doubt, the author’s own children, in whose\r\ncompanionship he delighted and whose education he conducted with wise\r\nsolicitude.\r\n\r\nIn his unselfish eagerness to see the truths of natural science brought\r\nwithin the comprehension and the enjoyment of all, Fabre would have been\r\nthe first to wish for a wide circulation for his own books in many\r\ncountries and many languages; and thus, though it is now too late to\r\nobtain his authorization of these translations, one cannot regard it as\r\na wrong to his memory to do what may lie in one’s power to spread the\r\nknowledge he has so wisely and wittily, with such insight and ingenuity,\r\nimparted to those of his own country and tongue.\r\n\r\nIt remains to add that in the following pages the somewhat stiff\r\ndialogue form of the original has given place to the more attractive and\r\nflexible narrative style, with as little violence as possible to the\r\nauthor’s text.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  THE\r\n                         STORY-BOOK OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\n                              Sursum corda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  THE\r\n                         STORY-BOOK OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\n                              Sursum corda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                                THE SIX\r\n\r\n\r\nONE evening, at twilight, they were assembled in a group, all six of\r\nthem. Uncle Paul was reading in a large book. He always reads to rest\r\nhimself from his labors, finding that after work nothing refreshes so\r\nmuch as communion with a book that teaches us the best that others have\r\ndone, said, and thought. He has in his room, well arranged on pine\r\nshelves, books of all kinds. There are large and small ones, with and\r\nwithout pictures, bound and unbound, and even gilt-edged ones. When he\r\nshuts himself up in his room it takes something very serious to divert\r\nhim from his reading. And so they say that Uncle Paul knows any number\r\nof stories. He investigates, he observes for himself. When he walks in\r\nhis garden he is seen now and then to stop before the hive, around which\r\nthe bees are humming, or under the elder bush, from which the little\r\nflowers fall softly, like flakes of snow; sometimes he stoops to the\r\nground for a better view of a little crawling insect, or a blade of\r\ngrass just pushing into view. What does he see? What does he observe?\r\nWho knows? They say, however, that there comes to his beaming face a\r\nholy joy, as if he had just found himself face to face with some secret\r\nof the wonders of God. It makes us feel better when we hear stories that\r\nhe tells at these moments; we feel better, and furthermore we learn a\r\nnumber of things that some day may be very useful to us.\r\n\r\nUncle Paul is an excellent, God-fearing man, obliging to every one, and\r\n“as good as bread.” The village has the greatest esteem for him, so much\r\nso that they call him Maître Paul, on account of his learning, which is\r\nat the service of all.\r\n\r\nTo help him in his field work—for I must tell you that Uncle Paul knows\r\nhow to handle a plow as well as a book, and cultivates his little estate\r\nwith success—he has Jacques, the old husband of old Ambroisine. Mother\r\nAmbroisine has the care of the house, Jacques looks after the animals\r\nand fields. They are better than two servants; they are two friends in\r\nwhom Uncle Paul has every confidence. They saw Paul born and have been\r\nin the house a long, long time. How often has Jacques made whistles from\r\nthe bark of a willow to console little Paul when he was unhappy! How\r\nmany times Ambroisine, to encourage him to go to school without crying,\r\nhas put a hard-boiled new-laid egg in his lunch basket! So Paul has a\r\ngreat veneration for his father’s two old servants. His house is their\r\nhouse. You should see, too, how Jacques and Mother Ambroisine love their\r\nmaster! For him, if it were necessary, they would let themselves be\r\nquartered.\r\n\r\nUncle Paul has no family, he is alone; yet he is never happier than when\r\nwith children, children who chatter, who ask this, that, and the other,\r\nwith the adorable ingenuousness of an awakening mind. He has prevailed\r\nupon his brother to let his children spend a part of the year with their\r\nuncle. There are three: Emile, Jules, and Claire.\r\n\r\nClaire is the oldest. When the first cherries come she will be twelve\r\nyears old. Little Claire is industrious, obedient, gentle, a little\r\ntimid, but not in the least vain. She knits stockings, hems\r\nhandkerchiefs, studies her lessons, without thinking of what dress she\r\nshall wear Sunday. When her uncle, or Mother Ambroisine, who is almost a\r\nmother to her, tells her to do a certain thing, she does it at once,\r\neven with pleasure, happy in being able to render some little service.\r\nIt is a very good quality.\r\n\r\nJules is two years younger. He is a rather thin little body, lively, all\r\nfire and flame. When he is preoccupied about something, he does not\r\nsleep. He has an insatiable appetite for knowledge. Everything interests\r\nand takes possession of him. An ant drawing a straw, a sparrow chirping\r\non the roof, are sufficient to engross his attention. He then turns to\r\nhis uncle with his interminable questions: Why is this? Why is that? His\r\nuncle has great faith in this curiosity, which, properly guided, may\r\nlead to good results. But there is one thing about Jules that his uncle\r\ndoes not like. As we must be honest, we will own that Jules has a little\r\nfault which would become a grave one if not guarded against: he has a\r\ntemper. If he is opposed he cries, gets angry, makes big eyes, and\r\nspitefully throws away his cap. But it is like the boiling over of milk\r\nsoup: a trifle will calm him. Uncle Paul hopes to be able to bring him\r\nround by gentle reprimands, for Jules has a good heart.\r\n\r\nEmile, the youngest of the three, is a complete madcap; his age permits\r\nit. If any one gets a face smeared with berries, a bump on the forehead,\r\nor a thorn in the finger, it is sure to be he. As much as Jules and\r\nClaire enjoy a new book, he enjoys a visit to his box of playthings. And\r\nwhat has he not in the way of playthings? Now it is a spinning-top that\r\nmakes a loud hum, then blue and red lead soldiers, a Noah’s Ark with all\r\nsorts of animals, a trumpet which his uncle has forbidden him to blow\r\nbecause it makes too much noise, then—But he is the only one that knows\r\nwhat there is in that famous box. Let us say at once, before we forget\r\nit, Emile is already asking questions of his uncle. His attention is\r\nawakening. He begins to understand that in this world a good top is not\r\neverything. If one of these days he should forget his box of playthings\r\nfor a story, no one would be surprised.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                   THE FAIRY TALE AND THE TRUE STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE six of them were gathered together. Uncle Paul was reading in a big\r\nbook, Jacques braiding a wicker basket, Mother Ambroisine plying her\r\ndistaff, Claire marking linen with red thread, Emile and Jules playing\r\nwith the Noah’s Ark. And when they had lined up the horse after the\r\ncamel, the dog after the horse, then the sheep, donkey, ox, lion,\r\nelephant, bear, gazelle, and a great many others,—when they had them all\r\narranged in a long procession leading to the ark, Emile and Jules, tired\r\nof playing, said to Mother Ambroisine: “Tell us a story, Mother\r\nAmbroisine—one that will amuse us.”\r\n\r\nAnd with the simplicity of old age Mother Ambroisine spoke as follows,\r\nat the same time twirling her spindle:\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time a grasshopper went to the fair with an ant. The river\r\nwas all frozen. Then the grasshopper gave a jump and landed on the other\r\nside of the ice, but the ant could not do this; and it said to the\r\ngrasshopper: ‘Take me on your shoulders; I weigh so little.’ But the\r\ngrasshopper said: ‘Do as I do; give a spring, and jump.’ The ant gave a\r\nspring, but slipped and broke its leg.\r\n\r\n“Ice, ice, the strong should be kind; but you are wicked, to have broken\r\nthe ant’s leg—poor little leg.\r\n\r\n“Then the ice said: ‘The sun is stronger than I, and it melts me.’\r\n\r\n“Sun, sun, the strong should be kind; but you are wicked, to melt the\r\nice; and you, ice, to have broken the ant’s leg—poor little leg.\r\n\r\n“Then the sun said: ‘The clouds are stronger than I; they hide me.’\r\n\r\n“Clouds, clouds, the strong should be kind; but you are wicked, to hide\r\nthe sun; you, sun, to melt the ice; and you, ice, to have broken the\r\nant’s leg—poor little leg.\r\n\r\n“Then the clouds said: ‘The wind is stronger than we; it drives us\r\naway.’\r\n\r\n“Wind, wind, the strong should be kind; but you are wicked, to drive\r\naway the clouds; you, clouds, to hide the sun; you, sun, to melt the\r\nice; and you, ice, to have broken the ant’s leg—poor little leg.\r\n\r\n“Then the wind said: ‘The walls are stronger than I; they stop me.’\r\n\r\n“Walls, walls, the strong should be kind; but you are wicked, to stop\r\nthe wind; you, wind, to drive away the clouds; you, clouds, to hide the\r\nsun; you, sun, to melt the ice; and you, ice, to have broken the ant’s\r\nleg—poor little leg.\r\n\r\n“Then the walls said: ‘The rat is stronger than we; it bores holes\r\nthrough us.’\r\n\r\n“Rat, rat, the strong—”\r\n\r\n“But it is all the same thing, over and over again, Mother Ambroisine,”\r\nexclaimed Jules impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Not quite, my child. After the rat comes the cat that eats the rat,\r\nthen the broom that strikes the cat, then the fire that burns the broom,\r\nthen the water that puts out the fire, then the ox that quenches his\r\nthirst with the water, then the fly that stings the ox, then the swallow\r\nthat snaps up the fly, then the snare that catches the swallow, then—”\r\n\r\n“And does it go on very long like that?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“As long as you please,” replied Mother Ambroisine, “for however strong\r\none may be, there are always others stronger still.”\r\n\r\n“Really, Mother Ambroisine,” said Emile, “that story tires me.”\r\n\r\n“Then listen to this one: Once upon a time there lived a woodchopper and\r\nhis wife, and they were very poor. They had seven children, the youngest\r\nso very, very small that a wooden shoe answered for its bed.”\r\n\r\n“I know that story,” again interposed Emile. “The seven children are\r\ngoing to get lost in the woods. Little Hop-o’-my-Thumb marks the way at\r\nfirst with white pebbles, then with bread crumbs. Birds eat the crumbs.\r\nThe children get lost, Hop-o’-my-Thumb, from the top of a tree, sees a\r\nlight in the distance. They run to it: rat-tat-tat! It is the dwelling\r\nof an ogre!”\r\n\r\n“There is no truth in that,” declared Jules, “nor in Puss-in-Boots, nor\r\nCinderella, nor Bluebeard. They are fairy tales, not true stories. For\r\nmy part, I want stories that are really and truly so.”\r\n\r\nAt the words, true stories, Uncle Paul raised his head and closed his\r\nbig book. A fine opportunity offered for turning the conversation to\r\nmore useful and interesting subjects than Mother Ambroisine’s old tales.\r\n\r\n“I approve of your wanting true stories,” said he. “You will find in\r\nthem at the same time the marvelous, which pleases so much at your age,\r\nand also the useful, with which even at your age you must concern\r\nyourselves, in preparation for after life. Believe me, a true story is\r\nmuch more interesting than a tale in which ogres smell fresh blood and\r\nfairies change pumpkins into carriages and lizards into lackeys. And\r\ncould it be otherwise? Compared with truth, fiction is but a pitiful\r\ntrifle; for the former is the work of God, the latter the dream of man.\r\nMother Ambroisine could not interest you with the ant that broke its leg\r\nin trying to cross the ice. Shall I be more fortunate? Who wants to hear\r\na true story of real ants?”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White Ant]\r\n\r\n\r\n“I! I!” cried Emile, Jules, and Claire all together.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                        THE BUILDING OF THE CITY\r\n\r\n\r\n“THEY are noble workers” began Uncle Paul, “Many a time, when the\r\nmorning sun begins to warm up, I have taken pleasure in observing the\r\nactivity that reigns around their little mounds of earth, each with its\r\nsummit pierced by a hole for exit and entrance.\r\n\r\n“There are some that come from the bottom of this hole. Others follow\r\nthem, and still more, on and on. They carry between their teeth a tiny\r\ngrain of earth, an enormous weight for them. Arrived at the top of the\r\nmound, they let their burden fall, and it rolls over the slope, and they\r\nimmediately descend again into their well. They do not play on the way,\r\nor stop with their companions to rest a while. Oh! no: the work is\r\nurgent, and they have so much to do! Each one arrives, serious, with its\r\ngrain of earth, deposits it, and descends in search of another. What are\r\nthey so busy about?\r\n\r\n“They are building a subterranean town, with streets, squares,\r\ndormitories, storehouses; they are hollowing out a dwelling-place for\r\nthemselves and their family. At a depth where rain cannot penetrate they\r\ndig the earth and pierce it with galleries, which lengthen into long\r\ncommunicating streets, sub-divided into short ones, crossing one another\r\nhere and there, sometimes ascending, sometimes descending, and opening\r\ninto large halls. These immense works are executed grain by grain, drawn\r\nby strength of the jaws. If any one could see that black army of miners\r\nat work under the ground, he would be filled with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“They are there by the thousands, scratching, biting, drawing, pulling,\r\nin the deepest darkness. What patience! What efforts! And when the grain\r\nof sand has at last given way, how they go off, head held high and\r\nproud, carrying it triumphantly above! I have seen ants, whose heads\r\ntottered under the tremendous load, exhaust themselves in getting to the\r\ntop of the mound. In jostling their companions, they seemed to say: See\r\nhow I work! And nobody could blame them, for the pride of work is a\r\nnoble pride. Little by little, at the gate of the town, that is to say\r\nat the edge of the hole, this little mound of earth is piled up, formed\r\nby excavated material from the city that is being built. The larger the\r\nmound, the larger the subterranean dwelling, it is plain.\r\n\r\n“Hollowing out these galleries in the ground is not all; they must also\r\nprevent landslides, fortify weak places, uphold the vaults with pillars,\r\nmake partitions. These miners are then seconded by carpenters. The first\r\ncarry the earth out of the ant-hill, the second bring the building\r\nmaterials. What are these materials! They are pieces of timber-work,\r\nbeams, and small joists, suitable for the edifice. A tiny little bit of\r\nstraw is a solid beam for a ceiling, the stem of a dry leaf can become a\r\nstrong column. The carpenters explore the neighboring forests, that is\r\nto say the tufts of grass, to choose their pieces.\r\n\r\n“Good! see this covering of an oat-grain. It is very thin, dry, and\r\nsolid. It will make an excellent plank for the partition they are\r\nconstructing below. But it is heavy, enormously heavy. The ant that has\r\nmade the discovery draws backward and makes itself rigid on its six\r\nfeet. No success: the heavy mass does not move. It tries again, all its\r\nlittle body trembling with energy. The oat-husk just moves a tiny bit.\r\nThe ant recognizes its powerlessness. It goes off. Will it abandon the\r\npiece? Oh! no. When one is an ant, one has the perseverance that\r\ncommands success. Here it is coming back with two helpers. One seizes\r\nthe oat in front, the others hitch themselves to the side, and behold!\r\nit rolls, it advances; it will get there. There are difficult steps, but\r\nthe ants they meet along the route will give them a shoulder.\r\n\r\n“They have succeeded, not without trouble. The oat is at the entrance to\r\nthe under-ground city. Now things become complicated; the piece gets\r\nawry; leaning against the edge of the hole, it cannot enter. Helpers\r\nhasten up. Ten, twenty unite their efforts without success. Two or three\r\nof them, engineers perhaps, detach themselves from the band, and seek\r\nthe cause of this insurmountable resistance. The difficulty is soon\r\nsolved: they must put the piece with the point at the bottom. The oat is\r\ndrawn back a little, so that one end overhangs the hole. One ant seizes\r\nthis end while the others lift the end that is on the ground, and the\r\npiece, turning a somersault, falls into the well, but is prudently held\r\non to by the carpenters clinging to the sides. You may perhaps think, my\r\nchildren, that the miners mounting with their grain of earth would stop\r\nfrom curiosity before this mechanical prodigy? Not at all, they have not\r\ntime. They pass with their loads of excavated material, without a glance\r\nat the carpenters’ work. In their ardor they are even bold enough to\r\nslide under the moving beams, at the risk of being crippled. Let them\r\nlook out! That is their affair.\r\n\r\n“One must eat when one works so hard. Nothing creates an appetite like\r\nviolent exercise. Milkmaid ants go through the ranks; they have just\r\nmilked the cows and are now distributing the milk to the workers.”\r\n\r\nHere Emile burst out laughing. “But that is not really and truly so?”\r\nsaid he to his uncle. “Milkmaid ants, cows, milk! It is a fairy tale\r\nlike Mother Ambroisine’s.”\r\n\r\nEmile was not the only one to be surprised at the peculiar expressions\r\nUncle Paul had used. Mother Ambroisine no longer turned her spindle,\r\nJacques did not plait his wickers, Jules and Claire stared with\r\nwide-open eyes. All thought it a jest.\r\n\r\n“No, my dears,” said Uncle Paul. “I am not jesting; no. I have not\r\nexchanged the truth for a fairy tale. It is true there are milkmaid ants\r\nand cows. But as that demands some explanation, we will put off the\r\ncontinuation of the story until to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nEmile drew Jules off into a corner, and said to him in confidence:\r\n“Uncle’s true stories are very amusing, much more so than Mother\r\nAmbroisine’s tales. To hear the rest about those wonderful cows I would\r\nwillingly leave my Noah’s Ark.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                                THE COWS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next day Emile, when only half awake, began to think of the ants’\r\ncows. “We must beg uncle,” said he to Jules, “to tell us the rest of his\r\nstory this morning.”\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done: they went to look for their uncle.\r\n\r\n“Aha!” cried he upon hearing their request, “the ants’ cows are\r\ninteresting you. I will do better than tell you about them, I will show\r\nthem to you. First of all call Claire.”\r\n\r\nClaire came in haste. Their uncle took them under the elder bush in the\r\ngarden, and this is what they saw:\r\n\r\nThe bush is white with flowers. Bees, flies, beetles, butterflies, fly\r\nfrom one flower to another with a drowsy murmur. On the trunk of the\r\nelder, amongst the ridges of the bark, numbers of ants are crawling,\r\nsome ascending, some descending. Those ascending are the more eager.\r\nThey sometimes stop the others on the way and appear to consult them as\r\nto what is going on above. Being informed, they begin climbing again\r\nwith even more ardor, proof that the news is good. Those descending go\r\nin a leisurely manner, with short steps. Willingly they halt to rest or\r\nto give advice to those who consult them. One can easily guess the cause\r\nof the difference in eagerness of those ascending and those descending.\r\nThe descending ants have their stomachs swollen, heavy, deformed, so\r\nfull are they; those ascending have their stomachs thin, folded up,\r\ncrying hunger. You cannot mistake them: the descending ants are coming\r\nback from a feast and, well fed, are returning home with the slowness\r\nthat a heavy paunch demands; the ascending ants are running to the same\r\nfeast and put into the assault of the bush the eagerness of an empty\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n“What do they find on the elder to fill their stomachs?” asked Jules.\r\n“Here are some that can hardly drag along. Oh, the gluttons!”\r\n\r\n“Gluttons! no,” Uncle Paul corrected him; “for they have a worthy motive\r\nfor gorging themselves. There is above, on the elder, an immense number\r\nof the cows. The descending ants have just milked them, and it is in\r\ntheir paunch that they carry the milk for the common nourishment of the\r\nant-hill colony. Let us look at the cows and the way of milking them.\r\nDon’t expect, I warn you, herds like ours. One leaf serves them for\r\npasturage.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul drew down to the children’s level the top of a branch, and\r\nall looked at it attentively. Innumerable black velvety lice, immobile\r\nand so close together as to touch one another, cover the under side of\r\nthe leaves and the still tender wood. With a sucker more delicate than a\r\nhair plunged into the bark, they fill themselves peacefully with the sap\r\nof the elder without changing their position. At the end of their back,\r\nthey have two short and hollow hairs, two tubes from which, if you look\r\nattentively, you can see a little drop of sugary liquid escape from time\r\nto time. These black lice are called plant-lice. They are the ants’\r\ncows. The two tubes are the udders, and the liquor which drips from\r\ntheir extremity is the milk. In the midst of the herd, on the herd,\r\neven, when the cattle are too close together, the famished ants come and\r\ngo from one louse to another, watching for the delicious little drop.\r\nThe one who sees it runs, drinks, enjoys it, and seems to say on raising\r\nits little head: Oh, how good, oh, how good it is! Then it goes on its\r\nway looking for another mouthful of milk. But plant-lice are stingy with\r\ntheir milk; they are not always disposed to let it run through their\r\ntubes. Then the ant, like a milkmaid ready to milk her cow, lavishes the\r\nmost endearing caresses on the plant-louse. With its antennæ, that is to\r\nsay, with its little delicate flexible horns, it gently pats the stomach\r\nand tickles the milk-tubes. The ant nearly always succeeds. What cannot\r\ngentleness accomplish! The plant-louse lets itself be conquered; a drop\r\nappears which is immediately licked up. Oh, how good, how good! As the\r\nlittle paunch is not full, the ant goes to other plant-lice trying the\r\nsame caresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plant-louse]\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Paul let go the branch, which sprang back into its natural\r\nposition. Milkmaids, cattle, and pasture were at once at the top of the\r\nelder bush.\r\n\r\n“That is wonderful, Uncle,” cried Claire.\r\n\r\n“Wonderful, my dear child. The elder is not the only bush that nourishes\r\nmilk herds for the ants. Plant-lice can be found on many other forms of\r\nvegetation. Those on the rosebush and cabbage are green; on the elder,\r\nbean, poppy, nettle, willow, poplar, black; on the oak and thistle,\r\nbronze color; on the oleander and nut, yellow. All have the two tubes\r\nfrom which oozes the sugary liquor; all vie with one another in feasting\r\nthe ants.”\r\n\r\nClaire and her uncle went in-doors. Emile and Jules, enraptured by what\r\nthey had just seen, began to look for lice on other plants. In less than\r\nan hour they had found four different kinds, all receiving visits of no\r\ndisinterested sort from the ants.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                             THE SHEEPFOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the evening Uncle Paul resumed the story of the ants. At that hour\r\nJacques was in the habit of going the round of the stables to see if the\r\noxen were eating their fodder and if the well-fed lambs were sleeping\r\npeacefully beside their mothers. Under the pretense of giving the\r\nfinishing touches to his wicker basket, Jacques stayed where he was. The\r\nreal reason was that the ants’ cows were on his mind. Uncle Paul related\r\nin detail what they had seen in the morning on the elder: how the\r\nplant-lice let the sugary drops ooze from their tubes, how the ants\r\ndrank this delicious liquid and knew how, if necessary, to obtain it by\r\ncaresses.\r\n\r\n“What you are telling us, Master,” said Jacques, “puts warmth into my\r\nold veins. I see once more how God takes care of His creatures, He who\r\ngives the plant-louse to the ant as He gives the cow to man.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my good Jacques,” returned Uncle Paul, “these things are done to\r\nincrease our faith in Providence, whose all-seeing eye nothing can\r\nescape. To a thoughtful person, the beetle that drinks from the depths\r\nof a flower, the tuft of moss that receives the rain-drop on the burning\r\ntile, bear witness to the divine goodness.\r\n\r\n“To return to my story. If our cows wandered at will in the country, if\r\nwe were obliged to take troublesome journeys to go and milk them in\r\ndistant pastures, uncertain whether we should find them or not, it would\r\nbe hard work for us, and very often impossible. How do we manage then?\r\nWe keep them close at hand, in inclosures and in stables. This also is\r\nsometimes done by the ants with the plant-lice. To avoid tiresome\r\njourneys, sometimes useless, they put their herds in a park. Not all\r\nhave this admirable foresight, however. Besides, if they had, it would\r\nbe impossible to construct a park large enough for such innumerable\r\ncattle and their pasturage. How, for example, could they inclose in\r\nwalls the willow that we saw this morning with its population of black\r\nlice? It is necessary to have conditions that are not beyond the forces\r\navailable. Given a tuft of grass whose base is covered with a few\r\nplant-lice, the park is practicable.\r\n\r\n“Ants that have found a little herd plan how to build a sheepfold, a\r\nsummer châlet, where the plant-lice can be inclosed, sheltered from the\r\ntoo bright rays of the sun. They too will stay at the châlet for some\r\ntime, so as to have the cows within reach and to milk them at leisure.\r\nTo this end, they begin by removing a little of the earth at the base of\r\nthe tuft so as to uncover the upper part of the root. This exposed part\r\nforms a sort of natural frame on which the building can rest. Now grains\r\nof damp earth are piled up one by one and shaped into a large vault,\r\nwhich rests on the frame of the roots and surrounds the stem above the\r\npoint occupied by the plant-lice. Openings are made for the service of\r\nthe sheepfold. The châlet is finished. Its inmates enjoy cool and quiet,\r\nwith an assured supply of provisions. What more is needed for happiness?\r\nThe cows are there, very peaceful, at their rack, that is to say, fixed\r\nby their suckers to the bark. Without leaving home the ants can drink to\r\nsatiety that sweet milk from the tubes.\r\n\r\n“Let us say, then, that the sheepfold made of clay is a building of not\r\nmuch importance, raised with little expense and hastily. One could\r\noverturn it by blowing hard. Why lavish such pains on so temporary a\r\nshelter? Does the shepherd in the high mountains take more care of his\r\nhut of pine branches, which must serve him for one or two months?\r\n\r\n“It is said that ants are not satisfied with inclosing small herds of\r\nplant-lice found at the base of a tuft of grass, but that they also\r\nbring into the sheepfold plant-lice encountered at a distance. They thus\r\nmake a herd for themselves when they do not find one already made. This\r\nmark of great foresight would not surprise me; but I dare not certify\r\nit, never having had the chance to prove it myself. What I have seen\r\nwith my own eyes is the sheepfold of the plant-lice. If Jules looks\r\ncarefully he will find some this summer, when the days are warmest, at\r\nthe base of various potted plants.”\r\n\r\n“You may be sure, Uncle,” said Jules, “I shall look for them. I want to\r\nsee those strange ants’ châlets. You have not yet told us why ants gorge\r\nthemselves so, when they have the good luck to find a herd of\r\nplant-lice. You said those descending the elder with their big stomachs\r\nwere going to distribute the food in the ant-hill.”\r\n\r\n“A foraging ant does not fail to regale itself on its own account if the\r\noccasion offers; and it is only fair. Before working for others must one\r\nnot take care of one’s own strength? But as soon as it has fed itself,\r\nit thinks of the other hungry ones. Among men, my child, it does not\r\nalways happen so. There are people who, well fed themselves, think\r\neverybody else has dined. They are called egoists. God forbid your ever\r\nbearing that sorry name, of which the ant, paltry little creature, would\r\nbe ashamed! As soon as it is satisfied, then, the ant remembers the\r\nhungry ones, and consequently fills the only vessel it has for carrying\r\nliquid food home; that is to say, its paunch.\r\n\r\n“Now see it returning, with its swollen stomach. Oh! how it has stuffed\r\nso that others may eat! Miners, carpenters, and all the workers occupied\r\nin building the city await it so as to resume their work heartily, for\r\npressing occupations do not permit them to go and seek the plant-lice\r\nthemselves. It meets a carpenter, who for an instant drops his straw.\r\nThe two ants meet mouth to mouth, as if to kiss. The milk-carrying ant\r\ndisgorges a tiny little bit of the contents of its paunch, and the other\r\none drinks the drop with avidity. Delicious! Oh! now how courageously it\r\nwill work! The carpenter goes back to his straw again, the milk-carrier\r\ncontinues his delivery route. Another hungry one is met. Another kiss,\r\nanother drop disgorged and passed from mouth to mouth. And so on with\r\nall the ants that present themselves, until the paunch is emptied. The\r\nmilk-ant then departs to fill up its can again.\r\n\r\n“Now, you can imagine that, to feed by the beakful a crowd of workers\r\nwho cannot go themselves for victuals, one milk-ant is not enough; there\r\nmust be a host of them. And then, under the ground, in the warm\r\ndormitories, there is another population of hungry ones. They are the\r\nyoung ants, the family, the hope of the city. I must tell you that ants,\r\nas well as other insects, hatch from an egg, like birds.”\r\n\r\n“One day,” interposed Emile, “I lifted up a stone and saw a lot of\r\nlittle white grains that the ants hastened to carry away under the\r\nground.”\r\n\r\n“Those white grains were eggs,” said Uncle Paul, “which the ants had\r\nbrought up from the bottom of their dwelling to expose them under the\r\nstone to the heat of the sun and facilitate their hatching. They hurried\r\nto descend again, when the stone was raised, so as to put them in a safe\r\nplace, sheltered from danger.\r\n\r\n“On coming out from the egg, the ant has not the form that you know. It\r\nis a little white worm, without feet, and quite powerless, not even able\r\nto move. There are in an ant-hill thousands of those little worms.\r\nWithout stop or rest, the ants go from one to another, distributing a\r\nbeakful, so that they begin to grow and change in one day into ants. I\r\nleave you to think how much they must work and how many plant-lice must\r\nbe milked, merely to nurse the little ones that fill the dormitories.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                            THE WILY DERVISH\r\n\r\n\r\n“THERE are ant-hills everywhere, large or small,” observed Jules. “Even\r\nin the garden I could have counted a dozen. From some the ants are so\r\nnumerous they blacken the road when they come out. It must take a great\r\nmany plant-lice to nourish all that little colony.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chess-board with pieces in position]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Numerous though they be,” his uncle assured him, “they will never lack\r\ncows, as plant-lice are still more numerous. There are so many that they\r\noften seriously menace our harvests. The miserable louse declares war\r\nagainst us. To understand it, listen to this story:\r\n\r\n“There was once a king of India who was much bored. To entertain him, a\r\ndervish invented the game of chess. You do not know this game. Well, on\r\na board something like a checkerboard two adversaries range, in battle\r\narray, one white, the other black, pieces of different values: pawns,\r\nknights, bishops, castles, queen and king. The action begins. The pawns,\r\nsimple foot-soldiers, are destined as always to receive the first of the\r\nglory on the battlefield. The king looks on at their extermination,\r\nguarded by his grandeur far from the fray. Now the cavalry charge,\r\nslashing with their swords right and left; even the bishops fight with\r\nhot-headed enthusiasm, and the ambulating castles go here and there,\r\nprotecting the flanks of the army. Victory is decided. Of the blacks,\r\nthe queen is a prisoner; the king has lost his castles; one knight and\r\none bishop do wonderful deeds to procure his flight. They succumb. The\r\nking is checkmated. The game is lost.\r\n\r\n“This clever game, image of war, pleased the bored king very much, and\r\nhe asked the dervish what reward he desired for his invention.\r\n\r\n“‘Light of the faithful,’ answered the inventor, ‘a poor dervish is\r\neasily satisfied. You shall give me one grain of wheat for the first\r\nsquare of the chessboard, two for the second, four for the third, eight\r\nfor the fourth, and you will double thus the number of grains, to the\r\nlast square, which is the sixty-fourth. I shall be satisfied with that.\r\nMy blue pigeons will have enough grain for some days.’\r\n\r\n“‘This man is a fool,’ said the king to himself; ‘he might have had\r\ngreat riches and he asks me for a few handfuls of wheat.’ Then, turning\r\nto his minister:—‘Count out ten purses of a thousand sequins for this\r\nman, and have a sack of wheat given him. He will have a hundred times\r\nthe amount of grain he asks of me.’\r\n\r\n“‘Commander of the faithful,’ answered the dervish, ‘keep the purses of\r\nsequins, useless to my blue pigeons, and give me the wheat as I wish.’\r\n\r\n“‘Very well. Instead of one sack, you shall have a hundred.’\r\n\r\n“‘It is not enough, Sun of Justice.’\r\n\r\n“‘You shall have a thousand.’\r\n\r\n“‘Not enough, Terror of the unfaithful. The squares of my chessboard\r\nwould not have their proper amount.’\r\n\r\n“In the meantime the courtiers whispered among themselves, astonished at\r\nthe singular pretensions of the dervish, who, in the contents of a\r\nthousand sacks, would not find his grain of wheat doubled sixty-four\r\ntimes. Out of patience, the king convoked the learned men to hold a\r\nmeeting and calculate the grains of wheat demanded. The dervish smiled\r\nmaliciously in his beard, and modestly moved aside while awaiting the\r\nend of the calculation.\r\n\r\n“And behold, under the pen of the calculators, the figure grew larger\r\nand larger. The work finished, the head one rose.\r\n\r\n“‘Sublime Commander,’ said he, ‘arithmetic has decided. To satisfy the\r\ndervish’s demand, there is not enough wheat in your granaries. There is\r\nnot enough in the town, in the kingdom, or in the whole world. For the\r\nquantity of grain demanded, the whole earth, sea and continents\r\ntogether, would be covered with a continuous bed to the depth of a\r\nfinger.’\r\n\r\n“The king angrily bit his mustache and, unable to count out to him his\r\ngrains of wheat, named the inventor of chess prime vizier. That is what\r\nthe wily dervish wanted.”\r\n\r\n“Like the king, I should have fallen into the dervish’s snare,” said\r\nJules. “I should have thought that doubling a grain sixty-four times\r\nwould only give a few handfuls of wheat.”\r\n\r\n“Henceforth,” returned Uncle Paul, “you will know that a number, even\r\nvery small, when multiplied a number of times by the same figure, is\r\nlike a snow-ball which grows in rolling, and soon becomes an enormous\r\nball which all our efforts cannot move.”\r\n\r\n“Your dervish was very crafty,” remarked Emile. “He modestly contented\r\nhimself with one grain of wheat for his blue pigeons, on condition that\r\nthey doubled the number on each square. Apparently, he asked next to\r\nnothing; in reality, he asked more than the king possessed. What is a\r\ndervish, Uncle?”\r\n\r\n“In the religions of the East they call by that name those who renounce\r\nthe world to give themselves up to prayer and contemplation.”\r\n\r\n“You say the king made him prime vizier. Is that a high office?”\r\n\r\n“Prime vizier means prime minister. The dervish then became the greatest\r\ndignitary of the State, after the king.”\r\n\r\n“I am no longer surprised that he refused the ten purses of a thousand\r\nsequins. He was waiting for something better. The ten purses, however,\r\nwould make a good sum?”\r\n\r\n“A sequin is a gold piece worth about twelve francs. At that rate, the\r\nking offered the dervish a sum of one hundred and twenty thousand\r\nfrancs, besides the sacks of wheat.”\r\n\r\n“And the dervish preferred the grain sixty-four times doubled.”\r\n\r\n“In comparison what was offered him was nothing.”\r\n\r\n“And the plant-lice?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“The story of the dervish is bringing us to that directly,” his uncle\r\nassured him.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                           A NUMEROUS FAMILY\r\n\r\n\r\n“A PLANT-LOUSE, we will suppose,” resumed Uncle Paul, “has just\r\nestablished itself on the tender shoot of a rosebush. It is alone, all\r\nalone. A few days after, young plant-lice surround it: they are its\r\nsons. How many are there? Ten, twenty, a hundred? Let us say ten. Is\r\nthat enough to assure the preservation of the species? Don’t laugh at my\r\nquestion. I know well that if the plant-lice were missing from the\r\nrosebushes, the order of things would not be sensibly changed.”\r\n\r\n“The ants would be the most to be pitied,” said Emile.\r\n\r\n“The round earth would continue to turn just the same, even when the\r\nlast plant-louse was dying on its leaf; but it is not, in truth, an idle\r\nquestion to ask if ten plant-lice suffice to preserve the race; for\r\nscience has no higher object than the quest of providential means for\r\nmaintaining everything in a just measure of prosperity.\r\n\r\n“Well, ten plant-lice coming from one would be far too many if we did\r\nnot have to take account of destructive agencies. One replacing one, the\r\npopulation remains the same; ten replacing one, in a short time the\r\nnumber increases beyond all possible limits. Think of the dervish’s\r\ngrain of wheat doubled sixty-four times, so that it becomes a bed of\r\nwheat of a finger’s depth over the whole earth. What would it be if it\r\nhad been multiplied ten times instead of doubled! In like manner, after\r\na few years, the descendants of a first plant-louse, continually\r\nmultiplied tenfold, would be in straitened circumstances in this world.\r\nBut there is the great reaper, death, which puts an invincible obstacle\r\nto overcrowding, counterbalances life in its overgrowing fecundity, and,\r\nin partnership with it, keeps all things in a perpetual youth. On a\r\nrosebush apparently most peaceful there is death every minute. But the\r\nsmall, the humble, and weak, are the habitual pasture, the daily bread,\r\nof the large eaters. To how many dangers is not the plant-louse exposed,\r\nso tiny, so weak, and without any means of defense! No sooner does a\r\nlittle bird, hardly out of the shell, discover with its piercing eyes a\r\nspot haunted by the plant-lice, than, merely as an appetizer, it will\r\nswallow hundreds. And if a worm, far more rapacious, a horrible worm\r\nexpressly created and put into the world to eat you alive, joins in, ah!\r\nmy poor plant-lice, may God, the good God of little creatures, protect\r\nyou; for your race is indeed in peril.\r\n\r\n“This devourer is of a delicate green with a white stripe on its back.\r\nIt is tapering in front, swollen at the back. When it doubles itself up\r\nit takes the shape of a tear-drop. They call it the ants’ lion because\r\nof the ravages it makes in the stupid herd. It establishes itself among\r\nthem. With its pointed mouth, it seizes one, the biggest, the plumpest;\r\nit sucks it and throws away the skin, which is too hard for it. Its\r\npointed head is lowered again, a second plant-louse seized, raised from\r\nthe leaf, and sucked. Then another and another, a twentieth, a\r\nhundredth. The foolish herd, whose ranks are thinning, do not even seem\r\nto perceive what is going on. The trapped plant-louse kicks between the\r\nlion’s fangs; the others, as if nothing were happening, continue to feed\r\npeacefully. It would take a good deal more than that to spoil their\r\nappetite! They eat while they are waiting to be eaten. The lion has had\r\nenough. He squats amidst the herd to digest at his ease. But digestion\r\nis soon over and already the greedy worm has its eye on those that he\r\nwill soon crunch. After two weeks of continual feasting, after having\r\nbrowsed as it were on whole herds of plant-lice, the worm turns into an\r\nelegant little dragon-fly with eyes as bright as gold, and known as the\r\n_hemerobius_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ladybug (_a_) larva (_b_) pupa (_c_) first joint of\r\nlarva]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Is that all? Oh, no. Here is the lady-bug, the good God’s bug. It is\r\nround and red, with black spots. It is very pleasing; it has an innocent\r\nair. Who would take it also to be a devourer, filling its stomach with\r\nplant-lice? Look at it closely on the rosebush, and you will see it at\r\nits ferocious feasting. It is very pretty and innocent-looking; but it\r\nis a glutton, there is no denying the fact, so fond is it of plant-lice.\r\n\r\n“Is that all? Oh, no. Those poor plant-lice are manna, the regular diet\r\nof all sorts of ravagers. Young birds eat them, the _hemerobius_ eats\r\nthem, lady-birds eat them, gluttons of all kinds eat them; and still\r\nthere are always plant-lice. Ah! that is where, in the fight between\r\nfecundity which repairs and the rough battle of life which destroys, the\r\nweak excel by opposing legions and legions to the chances of\r\nannihilation. In vain the devourers come from all sides and pounce upon\r\ntheir prey; the devoured survive by sacrificing a million to preserve\r\none. The weaker they are, the more fruitful they are.\r\n\r\n“The herring, cod, and sardine are given over as pasturage for the\r\ndevourers of the sea, earth, and sky. When they undertake long voyages\r\nto graze in favorable spots, their extermination is imminent. The hungry\r\nones of the sea surround the school of fish; the famished ones of the\r\nsky hover over their route; those of the earth await them on the shore.\r\nMan hastens to lend a strong hand to the killing and to take his share\r\nof the sea food. He equips fleets, goes to the fish with naval armies in\r\nwhich all nations are represented; he dries in the sun, salts, smokes,\r\npacks. But there is no perceptible diminution in the supply; for him the\r\nweak are infinite in number. One cod lays nine million eggs! Where are\r\nthe devourers that will see the end of such a family?”\r\n\r\n“Nine million eggs!” exclaimed Emile. “Is that a great many?”\r\n\r\n“Just to count them, one by one, would take nearly a year of ten working\r\nhours each day.”\r\n\r\n“Whoever counted them had lots of patience,” was Emile’s comment.\r\n\r\n“They are not counted,” replied Uncle Paul; “they are weighed, which is\r\nquickly done; and from the weight the number is deduced.\r\n\r\n“Like the cod in the sea, the plant-lice are exposed on their rosebushes\r\nand alders to numerous chances of destruction. I have told you that they\r\nare the daily bread of a multitude of eaters. So, to increase their\r\nlegions, they have rapid means that are not found in other insects.\r\nInstead of laying eggs, very slow in developing, they bring forth living\r\nplant-lice, which all, absolutely all, in two weeks have obtained their\r\ngrowth and begin to produce another generation. This is repeated all\r\nthrough the season, that is to say at least half the year, so that the\r\nnumber of generations succeeding one another during this period cannot\r\nbe less than a dozen. Let us say that one plant-louse produces ten,\r\nwhich is certainly below the actual number. Each of these ten plant-lice\r\nborne by the first one bears ten more, making one hundred in all; each\r\nof these hundred bears ten, in all one thousand; each of the thousand\r\nbears ten, in all ten thousand; and so on, multiplying always by ten,\r\neleven times. Here is the same calculation as the dervish’s grain of\r\nwheat, which grew with such astonishing rapidity when they multiplied it\r\nby two. For the family of the plant-lice the increase is much more\r\nrapid, as the multiplication is made by ten. It is true that the\r\ncalculation stops at the twelfth instead of going on to the\r\nsixty-fourth. No matter, the result would stupefy you; it is equal to a\r\nhundred thousand millions. To count a cod’s eggs, one by one, would take\r\nnearly a year; to count the descendants of one plant-louse for six\r\nmonths would take ten thousand years! Where are the devourers that would\r\nsee the end of the miserable louse? Guess how much space these\r\nplant-lice would cover, as closely packed as they are on the elder\r\nbranch.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps as large a place as our garden,” suggested Claire.\r\n\r\n“More than that; the garden is a hundred meters long and the same in\r\nwidth. Well, the family of that one plant-louse would cover a surface\r\nten times larger; that is to say, ten hectares. What do you say to that?\r\nIs it not necessary that the young birds, little lady-bugs, and the\r\ndragon-fly with the golden eyes should work hard in the extermination of\r\nthe louse, which if unhindered would in a few years overrun the world?\r\n\r\n“In spite of the hungry ones which devour them, the plant-lice seriously\r\nalarm mankind. Winged plant-lice have been seen flying in clouds thick\r\nenough to obscure the daylight. Their black legions went from one canton\r\nto another, alighted on the fruit trees, and ravaged them. Ah! when God\r\nwishes to try us, the elements are not always unchained. He sends\r\nagainst us in our pride the paltriest of creatures. The invisible mower,\r\nthe feeble plant-louse, comes, and man is filled with fear; for the good\r\nthings of the earth are in great peril.\r\n\r\n“Man, so powerful, can do nothing against these little creatures,\r\ninvincible in their multitude.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul finished the story of the ants and their cows. Several times\r\nsince, Emile, Jules, and Claire have talked of the prodigious families\r\nof the plant-louse and the cod, but rather lost themselves in the\r\nmillions and thousand millions. Their uncle was right: his stories\r\ninterested them much more than Mother Ambroisine’s tales.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                           THE OLD PEAR-TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE PAUL had just cut down a pear-tree in the garden. The tree was\r\nold, its trunk ravaged by worms, and for several years it had not borne\r\nany fruit. It was to be replaced by another. The children found their\r\nUncle Paul seated on the trunk of the pear-tree. He was looking\r\nattentively at something. “One, two, three, four, five,” said he,\r\ntapping with his finger upon the cross-section of the felled tree. What\r\nwas he counting?\r\n\r\n“Come quick,” he called, “come; the pear-tree is waiting to tell you its\r\nstory. It seems to have some curious things to tell you.”\r\n\r\nThe children burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n“And what does the old pear-tree wish to tell us?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Look here, at the cut which I was careful to make very clean with the\r\nax. Don’t you see some rings in the wood, rings which begin around the\r\nmarrow and keep getting larger and larger until they reach the bark?”\r\n\r\n“I see them,” Jules replied; “they are rings fitted one inside another.”\r\n\r\n“It looks a little like the circles that come just after throwing a\r\nstone into the water,” remarked Claire.\r\n\r\n“I see them too by looking closely,” chimed in Emile.\r\n\r\n“I must tell you,” continued Uncle Paul, “that those circles are called\r\nannual layers. Why annual, if you please? Because one is formed every\r\nyear; one only, understand, neither more nor less. The learned who spend\r\ntheir lives studying plants, and who are called botanists, tell us that\r\nno doubt is possible on that point. From the moment the little tree\r\nsprings from the seed to the time when the old tree dies, every year\r\nthere is formed a ring, a layer of wood. This understood, let us count\r\nthe layers of our pear-tree.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul took a pin to guide his counting; Emile, Jules, and Claire\r\nlooked on attentively. One, two, three, four, five—They counted thus up\r\nto forty-five, from the marrow to the bark.\r\n\r\n“The trunk has forty-five layers of wood,” announced Uncle Paul. “Who\r\ncan tell me what that signifies? How old is the pear-tree?”\r\n\r\n“That is not very hard,” answered Jules, “after what you have just told\r\nus. As it makes one ring every year, and we have counted forty-five, the\r\npear-tree must be forty-five years old.”\r\n\r\n“Eh! Eh! what did I tell you?” cried Uncle Paul, in triumph. “Has not\r\nthe pear-tree talked? It has begun its history by telling us its age.\r\nTruly, the tree is forty-five years old.”\r\n\r\n“What a singular thing!” Jules exclaimed. “You can know the age of a\r\ntree as if you saw its birth. You count the layers of wood; so many\r\nlayers, so many years. One must be with you, Uncle, to learn those\r\nthings. And the other trees, oak, beech, chestnut, do they do the same?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely the same. In our country every tree counts one year for each\r\nlayer. Count its layers and you have its age.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! how sorry I am I did not know that the other day,” put in Emile,\r\n“when they cut down the big beech which was in the way on the edge of\r\nthe road. Oh, my! What a fine tree! It covered a whole field with its\r\nbranches. It must have been very old.”\r\n\r\n“Not very,” said Uncle Paul. “I counted its layers; it had one hundred\r\nand seventy.”\r\n\r\n“One hundred and seventy, Uncle Paul! Honest and truly?”\r\n\r\n“Honest and truly, my little friend, one hundred and seventy.”\r\n\r\n“Then the beech was a hundred and seventy years old,” said Jules. “Is it\r\npossible? A tree to grow so old! And no doubt it would have lived many\r\nyears longer if the road-mender had not had it cut down to widen the\r\nroad.”\r\n\r\n“For us, a hundred and seventy years would certainly be a great age,”\r\nassented his uncle; “no one lives so long. For a tree it is very little.\r\nLet us sit down in the shade. I have more to tell you about the age of\r\ntrees.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                            THE AGE OF TREES\r\n\r\n\r\n“THEY used to tell of a chestnut of Sancerre whose trunk was more than\r\nfour meters round. According to the most moderate estimate its age must\r\nhave been three or four hundred years. Don’t cry out at the age of this\r\nchestnut. My story is just beginning, and you may be sure that, as a\r\nnarrator who stimulates the curiosity of his audience, I reserve the\r\noldest for the end.\r\n\r\n“Much larger chestnuts are known; for example, that of Neuve-Celle, on\r\nthe borders of the Lake of Geneva, and that of Esaü, in the neighborhood\r\nof Montélimar. The first is thirteen meters round at the base of the\r\ntrunk. From the year 1408 it sheltered a hermitage; the story has been\r\ntestified to. Since then four centuries and a half have passed, adding\r\nto its age, and lightning has struck it at different times. No matter,\r\nit is still vigorous and full of leaves. The second is a majestic ruin.\r\nIts high branches are despoiled; its trunk, eleven meters round, is\r\nplowed with deep crevices, the wrinkles of old age. To tell the age of\r\nthese two giants is hardly possible. Perhaps it might be reckoned at a\r\nthousand years, and still the two old trees bear fruit; they will not\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand years! If Uncle had not said it, I should not believe it.”\r\nThis from Jules.\r\n\r\n“Sh! You must listen to the end without saying anything,” cautioned his\r\nuncle.\r\n\r\n“The largest tree in the world is a chestnut on the slopes of Etna, in\r\nSicily. Look at the map: you will see down there, at the extreme end of\r\nItaly, opposite the toe of that beautiful country which has the shape of\r\na boot, a large island with three corners. That is Sicily. On that\r\nisland is a celebrated mountain which throws up burning matter—a\r\nvolcano, in short. It is called Etna. To come back to our chestnut, I\r\nmust tell you that they call it ‘the chestnut of a hundred horses,’\r\nbecause Jane, Queen of Aragon, visiting the volcano one day and,\r\novertaken by a storm, took refuge under it with her escort of a hundred\r\nhorsemen. Under its forest of leaves both riders and horses found\r\nshelter. To surround the giant, thirty people extending their arms and\r\njoining hands would not be enough. The trunk is more than fifty meters\r\nround. Judged by its size, it is less a tree-trunk than a fortress, a\r\ntower. An opening large enough to permit two carriages to pass abreast\r\ngoes through the base of the chestnut and gives access into the cavity\r\nof the trunk, which is fitted up for the use of those who go to gather\r\nchestnuts; for the old colossus still has young sap and seldom fails to\r\nbear fruit. It is impossible to estimate the age of this giant by its\r\nsize, for one suspects that a trunk as large as that comes from several\r\nchestnuts, originally distinct, but so near together that they have\r\nbecome welded into one.\r\n\r\n“Neustadt, in Württemberg, has a linden whose branches, overburdened by\r\nyears, are held up by a hundred pillars of masonry. The branches cover\r\nall together a space 130 meters in circumference. In 1229 this tree was\r\nalready old, for writers of that time call it ‘the big linden.’ Its\r\nprobable age to-day is seven or eight hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White Oak]\r\n\r\n\r\n“There was in France, at the beginning of this century, an older tree\r\nthan the veteran of Neustadt. In 1804 could be seen at the castle of\r\nChaillé, in the Deux-Sèvres, a linden 15 meters round. It had six main\r\nbranches propped with numerous pillars. If it still exists it cannot be\r\nless than eleven centuries old.\r\n\r\n“The cemetery of Allouville, in Normandy, is shaded by one of the oldest\r\noaks in France. The dust of the dead, into which it has thrust its\r\nroots, seems to have given it an exceptional vigor. Its trunk measures\r\nten meters in circumference at the base. A hermit’s chamber surmounted\r\nby a little steeple rises in the midst of its enormous branches. The\r\nbase of the trunk, partly hollow, is fitted up as a chapel dedicated to\r\nOur Lady of Peace. The greatest personages have esteemed it an honor to\r\ngo and pray in this rustic sanctuary and meditate a moment under the\r\nshade of the old tree which has seen so many graves open and shut.\r\nAccording to its size, they consider this oak to be about nine hundred\r\nyears old. The acorn that produced it must, then, have germinated about\r\nthe year 1000. To-day the old oak carries its monstrous branches without\r\neffort. Glorified by men and ravaged by lightning, it peacefully follows\r\nthe course of ages, perhaps having before it a future equal to its past.\r\n\r\n“Much older oaks are known. In 1824 a wood-cutter of Ardennes felled a\r\ngigantic oak in whose trunk were found sacrificial vases and antique\r\ncoins. The old oak had had fifteen or sixteen centuries of existence.\r\n\r\n“After the Allouville oak I will tell you of some more companions of the\r\ndead; for it is above all in these fields of repose, where the sanctity\r\nof the place protects them against the injuries of man, that the trees\r\nattain such an advanced age. Two yews in the cemetery of Haie-de-Routot,\r\ndepartment of Eure, merit attention above all. In 1832 they shaded with\r\ntheir foliage the whole of the field of the dead and a part of the\r\nchurch, without having experienced serious damage, when an extremely\r\nviolent windstorm threw a part of their branches to the ground. In spite\r\nof this mutilation these two yews are still majestic old trees. Their\r\ntrunks, entirely hollow, measure each of them nine meters in\r\ncircumference. Their age is estimated at fourteen hundred years.\r\n\r\n“That, however, is not more than half the age that some other trees of\r\nthe same kind have attained. A yew in a Scotch cemetery measured\r\ntwenty-nine meters around. Its probable age was two thousand five\r\nhundred years. Another yew, also in a cemetery in the same country, was,\r\nin 1660, so prodigious that the whole country was talking about it. They\r\nreckoned its age then at two thousand eight hundred and twenty-four\r\nyears. If it is still standing, this patriarch of European trees bears\r\nthe weight of more than thirty centuries.\r\n\r\n“Enough for the present. Now it is your turn to talk.”\r\n\r\n“I like better to be silent, Uncle Paul,” said Jules. “You have upset my\r\nmind with your trees that will not die.”\r\n\r\n“I am thinking of the old yew in the Scotch cemetery. Did you say three\r\nthousand years?” asked Claire.\r\n\r\n“Three thousand years, my dear child; and we might go still further\r\nback, if I were to tell you of certain trees in foreign countries. Some\r\nare known to be almost as old as the world.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                       THE LENGTH OF ANIMAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nJULES and Claire could not get over the astonishment caused by their\r\nuncle’s story of the old trees to which centuries are less than years\r\nare to us. Emile, with his usual restlessness, led the conversation to\r\nanother subject:\r\n\r\n“And animals, Uncle,” asked he, “how long do they live?”\r\n\r\n“Domestic animals,” was the reply, “seldom attain the age that nature\r\nallows them. We grudge them their nourishment, overtire them, and do not\r\ngive them proper shelter. And then, we take from them their milk,\r\nfleece, hide, flesh, in fact everything. How can you ever grow old when\r\nthe butcher is waiting for you at the stable door with his knife?\r\nUseless to speak of these poor victims of our need: to give us long\r\nlife, they do not live out their time. Supposing that an animal is well\r\ntreated, that it suffers neither hunger nor cold, that it lives in peace\r\nwithout excessive fatigue, without fear of knacker or butcher; under\r\nthese good conditions, how many years will it live?\r\n\r\n“Let us begin with the ox. Here is a robust one, I hope. What chest and\r\nshoulders! And then that big square forehead, with its vigorous horns\r\naround which the strap of the yoke goes; those eyes shining with the\r\nserene majesty of strength. If old age is the portion of the strong, the\r\nox ought to live for centuries.”\r\n\r\n“I should think so too,” assented Jules.\r\n\r\n“Quite wrong, my dear children; the ox, so big, strong, massive, is old,\r\nvery old, at twenty or thirty years. What to us would be verdant youth\r\nis for it decrepit old age.\r\n\r\n“Let us pass on to the horse. You see I do not take my examples from\r\namong the weak; I choose the most vigorous. Well, the horse, as well as\r\nits modest companion, the ass, scarcely reaches more than thirty or\r\nthirty-five years.”\r\n\r\n“How mistaken I was!” Jules exclaimed. “I thought the horse and ox\r\nstrong enough to live at least a century. They are so big, they take up\r\nso much room!”\r\n\r\n“I do not know, my little friend, whether you can understand me, but I\r\nwant to inform you that to take up a great deal of room in this world is\r\nnot the way to live in peace and to enjoy a long life. There are people\r\nwho take up a lot of space, not in the body—they are no bigger than\r\nwe—but in their pretensions and their ambitious manœuvers. Do they live\r\nin peace, are they preparing for themselves a venerable old age? It is\r\nvery doubtful. Let us remain small; that is to say, let us content\r\nourselves with the little that God has given us; let us beware of the\r\ntemptations of envy, the foolish counsels of pride; let us be full of\r\nactivity, of work, and not of ambition. That is the only way we are\r\npermitted to hope for length of days.\r\n\r\n“Let us return without delay to our animals. Our other domestic animals\r\nlive a still shorter time. A dog, at twenty or twenty-five years, can no\r\nlonger drag himself along; a pig is a tottering veteran at twenty; at\r\nfifteen at the most, a cat no longer chases mice, it says good-by to the\r\njoys of the roof and retires to some corner of a granary to die in\r\npeace; the goat and sheep, at ten or fifteen, touch extreme old age, the\r\nrabbit is at the end of its skein at eight or ten; and the miserable\r\nrat, if it lives four years, is looked upon among its own kind as a\r\nprodigy of longevity.\r\n\r\n“Would you like me to tell you about birds? Very well. The pigeon may\r\nlive from six to ten years; the guinea fowl, hen, and turkey, twelve. A\r\ngoose lives longer; it is true that in its quality of goose it does not\r\nworry. The goose attains twenty-five years, and even a good deal more.\r\n\r\n“But here is something better. The goldfinch, sparrow, birds free from\r\ncare, always singing, always frisking, happy as possible with a ray of\r\nsunlight in the foliage and a grain of hemp-seed, live as long as the\r\ngluttonous goose, and longer than the stupid turkey. These very happy\r\nlittle birds live from twenty to twenty-five years, the age of an ox. As\r\nI told you, taking up a lot of room in this world is not the way to\r\nprepare oneself for a long life.\r\n\r\n“As to man, if he leads a regular life, he often lives to eighty or\r\nninety. Sometimes he reaches a hundred or even more. But should he\r\nattain only the ordinary age, the average age, as they say, that is\r\nabout forty, then he is to be considered a privileged creature as to\r\nlength of life; the foregoing facts show it. And besides, for man, my\r\ndear children, length of life is not measured exactly according to the\r\nnumber of years. He lives most who works most. When God calls us to Him,\r\nlet us take with us the sincere esteem of others and the consciousness\r\nof having done our duty to the end; and, whatever our age, we shall have\r\nlived long enough.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                               THE KETTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW, that day, Mother Ambroisine was very tired. She had taken down from\r\ntheir shelves kettles, saucepans, lamps, candlesticks, casseroles, pans,\r\nand lids. After having rubbed them with fine sand and ashes, then washed\r\nthem well, she had put the utensils in the sun to dry them thoroughly.\r\nThey all shone like a mirror. The kettles particularly were superb with\r\ntheir rosy reflections; one might have said that tongues of fire were\r\nshining inside them. The candlesticks were a dazzling yellow. Emile and\r\nJules were lost in admiration.\r\n\r\n“I should like to know what they make kettles of, they shine so,”\r\nremarked Emile. “They are very ugly outside, all black, daubed with\r\nsoot; but inside, how beautiful they are!”\r\n\r\n“You must ask Uncle,” replied his brother.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” assented Emile.\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done: they went in search of their uncle. He did not\r\nhave to be entreated; he was happy whenever there was an opportunity to\r\nteach them something.\r\n\r\n“Kettles are made of copper,” he began.\r\n\r\n“And copper?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Copper is not made. In certain countries, it is found already made,\r\nmixed with stone. It is one of the substances that it is not in the\r\npower of man to make. We use these substances as God has deposited them\r\nin the bosom of the earth for purposes of human industry; but all our\r\nknowledge and all our skill could not produce them.\r\n\r\n“In the bosom of mountains where copper is found, they hollow out\r\ngalleries which go down deep into the earth. There workmen called\r\nminers, with lamps to light them, attack the rock with great blows of\r\nthe pick, while others carry the detached blocks outside. These blocks\r\nof stone in which copper is found are called ore. In furnaces made for\r\nthe purpose they heat the ore to a very high temperature. The heat of\r\nour stove, when it is red-hot, is nothing in comparison. The copper\r\nmelts, runs, and is separated from the rest. Then, with hammers of\r\nenormous weight, set in motion by a wheel turned by water, they strike\r\nthe mass of copper which, little by little, becomes thin and is hollowed\r\ninto a large basin.\r\n\r\n“The coppersmith continues the work. He takes the shapeless basin and,\r\nwith little strokes of the hammer, fashions it on the anvil to give it a\r\nregular shape.”\r\n\r\n“That is why coppersmiths tap all day with their hammers,” commented\r\nJules. “I had often wondered, when passing their shops, why they made so\r\nmuch noise, always tapping, without any stop. They were thinning the\r\ncopper; shaping it into saucepans and kettles.”\r\n\r\nHere Emile asked: “When a kettle is old, has holes in it and can’t be\r\nused, what do they do with it? I heard Mother Ambroisine speak of\r\nselling a worn-out kettle.”\r\n\r\n“It is melted, and another new kettle made out of the copper,” replied\r\nUncle Paul.\r\n\r\n“Then the copper does not wear away?”\r\n\r\n“It wears away too much, my friend: some of it is lost when they rub it\r\nwith sand to make it shine; some is lost, too, by the continual action\r\nof the fire; but what is left is still good.”\r\n\r\n“Mother Ambroisine also spoke of recasting a lamp which had lost a foot.\r\nWhat are lamps made of?”\r\n\r\n“They are of tin, another substance that we find ready-made in the bosom\r\nof the earth, without the power of producing it ourselves.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                                 METALS\r\n\r\n\r\n“COPPER and tin are called metals,” continued Uncle Paul. “They are\r\nheavy, shining substances, which bear the blows of the hammer without\r\nbreaking. They flatten, but do not break. There are still other\r\nsubstances which possess the considerable weight of copper and tin, as\r\nwell as their brilliancy and resistance to blows. All these substances\r\nare called metals.”\r\n\r\n“Then lead, which is so heavy, is a metal too?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“Iron also, silver and gold?” queried his brother.\r\n\r\n“Yes, these substances and still others are metals. All have a peculiar\r\nbrilliancy called metallic luster, but the color varies. Copper is red;\r\ngold, yellow; silver, iron, lead, tin, white, with a very slightly\r\ndifferent shade one from another.”\r\n\r\n“The candlesticks Mother Ambroisine is drying in the sun,” said Emile,\r\n“are a magnificent yellow and so shiny they dazzle. Are they gold?”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear child; your uncle does not possess such riches. They are\r\nbrass. To vary the colors and other properties of the metals, instead of\r\nalways using them separately, they often mix two or three together, or\r\neven more. They melt them together, and the whole constitutes a sort of\r\nnew metal, different from those which enter into its composition. Thus,\r\nin melting together copper and a kind of white metal called zinc, the\r\nsame as the garden watering-pots are made of, they obtain brass, which\r\nhas not the red of copper, nor the white of zinc, but the yellow of\r\ngold. The material of the candlesticks is, then, made of copper and zinc\r\ntogether; in a word, it is brass, and not gold, in spite of its luster\r\nand yellow color. Gold is yellow and glitters; but all that is yellow\r\nand glitters is not gold. At the last village fair they sold magnificent\r\nrings whose brilliancy deceived you. In gold, they would have cost a\r\nfine sum. The merchant sold them for a sou. They were brass.”\r\n\r\n“How can they tell gold from brass, since the color and luster are\r\nalmost the same?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“By the weight, chiefly. Gold is much heavier than brass; it is indeed\r\nthe heaviest metal in frequent use. After it comes lead, then silver,\r\ncopper, iron, tin, and finally zinc, the lightest of all.”\r\n\r\n“You told us that to melt copper,” put in Emile, “they needed a fire so\r\nintense, that the heat of a red-hot stove would be nothing in\r\ncomparison. All metals do not resist like that, for I remember very well\r\nin what a sorry way the first leaden soldiers you gave me came to their\r\nend. Last winter, I had lined them up on the luke-warm stove. Just when\r\nI was not watching, the troop tottered, sank down, and ran in little\r\nstreams of melted lead. I had only time to save half a dozen grenadiers,\r\nand their feet were missing.”\r\n\r\n“And when Mother Ambroisine thoughtlessly put the lamp on the stove,”\r\nadded Jules, “oh! it was soon done for: a finger’s breadth of tin had\r\ndisappeared.”\r\n\r\n“Tin and lead melt very easily,” explained Uncle Paul. “The heat of our\r\nhearth is enough to make them run. Zinc also melts without much trouble;\r\nbut silver, then copper, then gold, and finally iron, need fires of an\r\nintensity unknown in our houses. Iron, above all, has excessive\r\nresistance, very valuable to us.\r\n\r\n“Shovels, tongs, grates, stoves, are iron. These various objects, always\r\nin contact with the fire, do not melt, however; do not even soften. To\r\nsoften iron, so as to shape it easily on the anvil by blows from the\r\nhammer, the smith needs all the heat of his forge. In vain would he blow\r\nand put on coal; he would never succeed in melting it. Iron, however,\r\ncan be melted, but you must use the most intense heat that human skill\r\ncan produce.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                             METAL PLATING\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the morning some wandering coppersmiths were passing. Mother\r\nAmbroisine had sold them the old kettle. Besides the sale, they were to\r\nmake over the lamp whose foot had melted on the stove, and replate two\r\nsaucepans. So the smiths lighted a fire in the open air, set up their\r\nbellows on the ground, and in a large round iron spoon melted the old\r\nlamp, adding a little tin to replace what had been lost. The melted\r\nmetal was run into a mold, from which it came out in the shape of a\r\nlamp. This lamp, still pretty large, was fixed on a lathe which a little\r\nboy set in motion; and while it turned, the master touched it with the\r\nedge of a steel tool. The tin thus planed off fell in thin shavings,\r\nrolled up like curl-papers. The lamp was visibly becoming perfect; it\r\ntook the proper polish and shape.\r\n\r\nAfterward they busied themselves plating the copper saucepans. They\r\ncleaned them thoroughly inside with sand, put them on the fire, and,\r\nwhen they were very hot, went over the whole of their surface with a tow\r\npad and a little melted tin. Wherever the pad rubbed, the tin stuck to\r\nthe copper. In a few moments the inside of the saucepan, red before, was\r\nnow shiny white.\r\n\r\nEmile and Jules, while eating their little lunch of apples and bread,\r\nlooked on at this curious work without saying a word. They promised\r\nthemselves to ask their uncle the reason for whitening the inside of the\r\ncopper saucepans with tin. In the evening, accordingly, they spoke of\r\nthe tinning and plating.\r\n\r\n“Highly cleaned and polished iron is very brilliant,” explained their\r\nuncle. “The blade of a new knife, Claire’s scissors, carefully kept in\r\ntheir case, are examples. But, if exposed to damp air, iron tarnishes\r\nquickly and covers itself with an earthy and red crust called—”\r\n\r\n“Rust,” interposed Claire.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is called rust.”\r\n\r\n“The big nails that hold the iron wires where the bell-flowers climb up\r\nthe garden wall are covered with that red crust,” remarked Jules; and\r\nEmile added:\r\n\r\n“The old knife I found in the ground is covered with it too.”\r\n\r\n“Those large nails and the old knife are encrusted with rust because\r\nthey have remained for a long time exposed to the air and dampness. Damp\r\nair corrodes iron; it becomes incorporated with the metal and makes it\r\nunrecognizable. When rusty, iron no longer has the properties that make\r\nit so useful to us; it is a kind of red or yellow earth, in which,\r\nwithout looking attentively, it would be impossible to suspect a metal.”\r\n\r\n“I can well believe it,” said Jules. “For my part, I should never have\r\ntaken rust for iron with which air and moisture had become\r\nincorporated.”\r\n\r\n“Many other metals rust like iron; that is to say, they are converted\r\ninto earthy matter by contact with damp air. The color of rust varies\r\naccording to the metal. Iron rust is yellow or red, that of copper is\r\ngreen, lead and zinc white.”\r\n\r\n“Then the green rust of old pennies is copper rust,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“The white matter that covers the nozzle of the pump must be lead rust?”\r\nqueried Claire.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. The prime difficulty with rust is that it makes metals ugly:\r\nthey lose their brilliance and polish; but it works still greater\r\ninjury. There are harmless rusts which might get mixed with our food\r\nwithout danger: such is iron rust. On the contrary, copper and lead\r\nrusts are deadly poisons. If, by mischance, these rusts should get into\r\nour food, we might die, or at least we should experience cruel\r\nsuffering. We will speak only of copper, for lead, on account of its\r\nquick melting, cannot go on the fire and is not used for kitchen\r\nutensils. Copper rust, I say, is a mortal poison; and yet they prepare\r\nfood in copper vessels. Ask Mother Ambroisine.”\r\n\r\n“Very true,” said she, “but I always have my eye on my saucepans: I keep\r\nthem very clean and from time to time have them replated.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” put in Jules, “how the work that the tinsmith did\r\nthis morning could prevent the copper rust being a poison.”\r\n\r\n“The smith’s work will not make the copper rust cease to be a poison,”\r\nreplied Uncle Paul, “but it will prevent the rust’s forming. Of the\r\ncommon metals tin rusts the least. Exposed to the air a long time, it\r\nscarcely tarnishes. And then the rust, which forms in small quantities,\r\nis innocuous, like iron rust. To prevent copper from covering itself\r\nwith poisonous green spots, to preserve it from rust, it must be kept\r\nfrom contact with damp air and also with certain alimentary substances\r\nsuch as vinegar, oil, grease—substances that provoke the rapid formation\r\nof rust. For this reason the copper saucepan is coated over with tin\r\ninside. Under the thin bed of tin which covers it, the copper cannot\r\nrust, because it is no longer in contact with the air. The tin remains;\r\nbut this metal changes with difficulty, and, besides, its rust, if it\r\nforms any, is harmless. So they plate copper, that is to say they cover\r\nit with a thin bed of tin, to prevent its rusting, and thus to prevent\r\nthe formation of the dangerous poison that might, some day or other, be\r\nmixed with our food.\r\n\r\n“They also tin iron, not to prevent the formation of poison, for the\r\nrust of this metal is harmless, but simply to preserve it from changing\r\nand covering itself with ugly red spots. This tinned iron is called\r\ntin-plate. Lids, coffee-pots, dripping-pans, graters, lanterns, and\r\ninnumerable other things, are of tin-plate; that is to say, thin sheets\r\nof iron covered on both sides with a coating of tin.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                             GOLD AND IRON\r\n\r\n\r\n“SOME metals never rust; such a one is gold. Ancient gold pieces found\r\nin the earth after centuries are as bright as the day they were coined.\r\nNo dross, no rust covers their effigy and inscription. Time, fire,\r\nhumidity, air, cannot harm this admirable metal. Therefore gold, on\r\naccount of its unchangeable luster and its rarity, is preëminently the\r\nmaterial for ornaments and coins.\r\n\r\n“Furthermore, gold is the first metal that man became acquainted with,\r\nlong before iron, lead, tin, and the others. The reason why man’s\r\nattention was called to gold, long centuries before iron, is not hard to\r\nunderstand. Gold never rusts; iron rusts with such grievous facility\r\nthat in a short time, if we are not careful, it is converted into a red\r\nearth. I have just told you that gold objects, however old they may be,\r\nhave come to us intact, even after having been in the dampest ground. As\r\nfor objects of iron, not one has reached us that was not in an\r\nunrecognizable state. Corroded with rust, they have become a shapeless\r\nearthy crust. Now I will ask Jules if the iron ore that is extracted\r\nfrom the bowels of the earth can be real, pure iron, such as we use.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me not, Uncle; for if iron at any given moment is pure, it\r\nmust rust with time and change to earthy matter, as does the blade of a\r\nknife buried in the ground.”\r\n\r\n“My brother seems to reason correctly; I agree with him,” said Claire.\r\n\r\n“And gold?” Uncle Paul asked her.\r\n\r\n“It is different with gold,” she replied. “As that metal never rusts, is\r\nnot changed by time, air, and dampness, it must be pure.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so. In the rocks where it is disseminated in small scales, gold\r\nis as brilliant as in jewelers’ boxes. Claire’s earrings have not more\r\nluster than the particles set by nature in the rock. On the contrary,\r\nwhat a pitiful appearance iron makes when it is found! It is an earthy\r\ncrust, a reddish stone, in which only after long research can one\r\nsuspect the presence of a metal; it is, in fact, rust, mixed more or\r\nless with other substances. And then, it is not enough to perceive that\r\nthis rusty stone contains a metal; a way must still be found to\r\ndecompose the ore and bring the iron back to its metallic state. How\r\nmany efforts were necessary to attain this result, one of the most\r\ndifficult to achieve! How many fruitless attempts, how many painful\r\ntrials! Iron, then, was the last to become of use to us, long after gold\r\nand other metals, like copper and silver, which are sometimes, but not\r\nalways, found pure. That most useful of metals was the last; but with it\r\nan immense advance was made in human industry. From the moment man was\r\nin possession of iron, he found himself master of the earth.\r\n\r\n“At the head of substances that resist shock, iron must be placed; and\r\nit is precisely its enormous resistance to rupture that makes this metal\r\nso precious to us. Never would a gold, copper, marble, or stone anvil\r\nresist the blows of the smith’s hammer as an iron one does. The hammer\r\nitself, of what substance other than iron could it be made? If of\r\ncopper, silver, or gold, it would flatten, crush, and become useless in\r\na short time; for these metals lack hardness. If of stone, it would\r\nbreak at the first rather hard blow. For these implements nothing can\r\ntake the place of iron. Nor can it for axes, saws, knives, the mason’s\r\nchisel, the quarry-man’s pick, the plowshare, and a number of other\r\nimplements which cut, hew, pierce, plane, file, give or receive violent\r\nblows. Iron alone has the hardness that can cut most other substances,\r\nand the resistance that sets blows at defiance. In this respect iron is,\r\nof all mineral substances, the handsomest present that Providence has\r\ngiven to man. It is preëminently the material for tools, indispensable\r\nin every art and industry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hatchet of the Stone Age]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Claire and I read one day,” said Jules, “that when the Spaniards\r\ndiscovered America, the savages of that new country had gold axes, which\r\nthey very willingly exchanged for iron ones. I laughed at their\r\ninnocence, which made them give such a costly price for a piece of very\r\ncommon metal. I think I see now that the exchange was to their\r\nadvantage.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, decidedly to their advantage; for with an iron ax they could fell\r\ntrees to make their dug-out canoes and their huts; they could better\r\ndefend themselves against wild animals and attack the game in their\r\nhunts. This piece of iron gave them an assurance of food, a substantial\r\nboat, a warm dwelling, a redoubtable weapon. In comparison, a gold ax\r\nwas only a useless plaything.”\r\n\r\n“If iron came last, what did men do before they knew of it?” asked\r\nJules.\r\n\r\n“They made their weapons and tools of copper; for, like gold, this metal\r\nis sometimes in a pure state so that it can be utilized just as nature\r\ngives it to us. But a copper implement, having little hardness, is of\r\nmuch less value than an iron one. Thus, in those far-off days of copper\r\naxes, man was indeed a wretched creature.\r\n\r\n“He was still more so before knowing copper. He cut a flint into a\r\npoint, or split it, and fastened it to the end of a stick; and that was\r\nhis only weapon.\r\n\r\n“With this stone he had to procure food, clothing, a hut, and to defend\r\nhimself from wild beasts. His clothing was a skin thrown over his back,\r\nhis dwelling a hut made of twisted branches and mud; his food a piece of\r\nflesh, produce of the chase. Domestic animals were unknown, the earth\r\nuncultivated, all industry lacking.”\r\n\r\n“And where was that?” asked Claire.\r\n\r\n“Everywhere, my dear child; here, even in places where to-day are our\r\nmost flourishing towns. Oh! how forlorn man was before attaining, by the\r\nhelp of iron, the well-being that we enjoy to-day; how forlorn was man\r\nand what a great present Providence made him in giving him this metal!”\r\n\r\nJust as Uncle Paul finished, Jacques knocked discreetly at the door;\r\nJules ran to open it. They whispered a few words to each other. It was\r\nabout an important affair for the next day.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                               THE FLEECE\r\n\r\n\r\nAS was agreed upon the day before, Jacques made ready for the\r\nperformance. To keep the patients from moving, they were obliged to make\r\nthem lie down, their feet tied, between the two inclined planks of a\r\nrack. Steel knives shone on the ground. As for them, innocent victims of\r\nthe needs of man, they were already bound and lying on their sides. With\r\ngentle resignation they awaited their sad fate. Were they going to be\r\nslain? Oh, no: they were to be shorn. Jacques took a sheep by its feet,\r\nplaced it between the two planks of the rack, and, with large scissors,\r\nbegan, _cra-cra-cra_, to cut off the wool. Little by little, the fleece\r\nfell all in one piece. When the sheep had been despoiled, it ran free to\r\none side, ashamed and chilly. It had just given its covering to clothe\r\nman. Jacques put another one on the rack, and the scissors began to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Jacques,” said Jules, “are not the sheep very cold when they\r\nhave had their wool cut off? See how that one trembles that you have\r\njust shorn.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind that: I have chosen a fine day for it. The sun is warm. By\r\nto-morrow they won’t feel the need of their wool. And besides, ought not\r\nthe sheep to suffer a little cold so that we may be warm?”\r\n\r\n“We warm? How?”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spinning-wheel]\r\n\r\n\r\n“You astonish me. You do not know that, you who read so many books?\r\nWell, with this wool they will make you stockings and knitted things for\r\nthis winter; they will even make cloth, fine cloth for clothes.”\r\n\r\n“Peuh!” exclaimed Emile. “This wool is too dirty and ugly to make\r\nstockings, knitted things, and cloth.”\r\n\r\n“Dirty at present,” Jacques agreed, “but it will be washed in the river,\r\nand when it has become very white Mother Ambroisine will work it on her\r\nspinning-wheel and make yarn of it. This yarn knitted with needles will\r\nbecome stockings that one is very glad to have on one’s feet when\r\nobliged to run in the snow.”\r\n\r\n“I have never seen red, green, blue sheep; and yet there are red, green,\r\nblue, and other colored wools,” said Emile.\r\n\r\n“They dye the white wool that the sheep gives us; they put it into\r\nboiling water with drugs and coloring matter, and it comes out of that\r\nwater with a color that stays.”\r\n\r\n“And cloth?”\r\n\r\n“And cloth is made with threads of wool like those of stockings; but in\r\norder to weave these threads, make them cross each other regularly, and\r\nconvert them into fabric, you must have complicated machines, weaving\r\nlooms that cannot be had in our houses. These are only found in large\r\nfactories used for manufacturing woolen goods.”\r\n\r\n“Then these trousers that I have on come from the sheep; this vest; my\r\ncravat, stockings too. I am dressed in the spoils of the sheep?” This\r\nfrom Jules.\r\n\r\n“Yes, to defend ourselves from the cold, we take the sheep’s wool. The\r\npoor beast furnishes its fleece for our clothes, its milk and flesh for\r\nour nourishment, its skin for our gloves. We live on the life of our\r\ndomestic animals. The ox gives us his strength, flesh, hide; the cow,\r\nbesides, gives us milk. The donkey, mule, horse, work for us. As soon as\r\nthey are dead they leave us their skin, of which we make leather for our\r\nshoes. The hen gives us eggs, the dog puts his intelligence at our\r\nservice. And yet there are people who, without any motive, maltreat\r\nthese animals without which we should be so poor; who let them suffer\r\nhunger and beat them unmercifully! Never imitate those heartless ones;\r\nit would be an insult to God, who has given us the donkey, ox, sheep,\r\nand other animals. When I think that these valuable creatures give us\r\nall, even to their very life, I would share my last crust with them.”\r\n\r\nAnd the shears meanwhile continued their _cra-cra-cra_; and the fleece\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                             FLAX AND HEMP\r\n\r\n\r\nWHILE listening to what Jacques was saying about wool, Emile examined\r\nhis handkerchief attentively. He turned it over and over, felt it, then\r\nlooked through it. Jacques foresaw the question Emile was getting ready\r\nto ask him, and he said:\r\n\r\n“Handkerchiefs and linens are not woolen. Certain plants, cotton, hemp,\r\nflax, and not sheep, furnish them; for, you see, I don’t know much about\r\nthose things myself. I have heard tell of the cotton plant, but have\r\nnever seen it. And, besides, I am afraid talking to you will make me cut\r\nthe sheep’s skin.”\r\n\r\nIn the evening, at Jules’s request, they took up the history of the\r\nmaterials with which we clothe ourselves, and Uncle Paul explained their\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n“The outside of hemp and flax is composed of long threads, very fine,\r\nsupple, and tenacious, from which we manufacture our fabrics. We clothe\r\nourselves with the spoils of the sheep, we make ourselves fine with the\r\nbark of the plant. The fabrics of luxury, cambric, tulle, gauze,\r\npoint-lace, Mechlin lace, are made from flax; the stronger ones, even to\r\ncoarse sacking, are of hemp. The cotton plant gives us the fabrics made\r\nof cotton.\r\n\r\n“Flax is a slender plant with little delicate blue flowers, and is sown\r\nand harvested every year. It is much cultivated in Northern France,\r\nBelgium, and Holland. It is the first plant used by man for woven\r\nfabrics. Mummies of Egypt, the old land of Moses and the patriarchs,\r\nmummies which have lain buried four thousand years and more, are swathed\r\nin bands of linen.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flax]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Mummies, did you say?” interposed Jules. “I don’t know what they are.”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you, my dear child. Respect for the dead is found among all\r\npeople and in all ages. Man regards as sacred what was the seat of a\r\nsoul made in the image of God; he honors the dead, but the honors\r\nrendered differ according to time, place, customs. We inter the dead and\r\nput over the burial place a tombstone with an inscription, or at least a\r\nhumble cross, divine emblem of life eternal. The ancients burned them on\r\na funeral pile; they piously gathered the bones bleached by the fire and\r\ninclosed them in priceless vases. In Egypt, to preserve the cherished\r\nremains for the family, they embalmed the dead; that is to say, they\r\nimpregnated them with aromatics and swathed them in linen to prevent\r\ndecomposition. These pious duties were so delicately performed that,\r\nafter centuries and centuries, we find intact in their chests of\r\nsweet-smelling wood, but dried and blackened by years, contemporaries of\r\nthe ancient kings of Egypt, or the Pharaohs. These are what are called\r\nmummies.\r\n\r\n“Hemp has been cultivated all over Europe for many centuries. It is an\r\nannual, of a strong, nauseous odor, with little, green, dull-looking\r\nflowers, whose stem, of the thickness of a quill pen, rises to about two\r\nmeters. It is cultivated, like flax, both for its bark and for its\r\ngrain, called hemp-seed.”\r\n\r\n“That is the grain, I think,” said Emile, “we give the goldfinch, which\r\nit cracks with its beak when it breaks the shell to get out the little\r\nkernel.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, hemp-seed is the feast of little birds.\r\n\r\n“The bark of the hemp has not the fineness of flax. The fibers of this\r\nlatter plant are so fine that twenty-five grams of tow spun on the\r\nspinning-wheel furnishes a thread almost a league long. The spider’s web\r\nalone can rival in delicacy certain linen fabrics.\r\n\r\n“When hemp and flax reach maturity, they are harvested, and the seeds\r\nare separated by thrashing. The next operation, retting, then takes\r\nplace, its purpose being to render the filaments of the bark, or the\r\nfibers, as they are called, easily separable from the wood. These\r\nfibers, in fact, are pasted to the stem and stuck together by a gummy\r\nsubstance that is very resistant and prevents separation until it is\r\ndestroyed by rot. They sometimes do this retting by spreading the plants\r\nin the fields for a couple of weeks and turning them over now and then,\r\nuntil the tow detaches itself from the woody part or hemp-stalk.\r\n\r\n“But the quickest way is to tie the flax and hemp in bundles and keep\r\nthem submerged in a pond. There soon follows a rot which gives out\r\nintolerable smells; the bark decays, and the fiber, endowed with\r\nexceptional resistance, is freed.\r\n\r\n“Then the bundles are dried; after that they crush them between the jaws\r\nof an instrument called a brake, to crush the stems into small pieces\r\nand separate the tow. Finally, to purge the tow of all woody refuse and\r\nto divide it into the finest threads, they pass it between the iron\r\nteeth of a sort of big comb called a heckle. In this state, the fiber is\r\nspun either by hand or by machine. The thread obtained is ready for\r\nweaving.\r\n\r\n“On a loom they place in order, side by side, numerous threads composing\r\nwhat they call the warp. By turns, impelled by a pedal on which the\r\noperator’s foot presses, one half of these threads descends while the\r\nother half ascends. At the same time the operator passes a transverse\r\nthread in a shuttle through the two halves of the warp, from left to\r\nright, then from right to left. From this inter-crossing comes the woven\r\nfabric. And it is finished; the garb of the plant has changed masters;\r\nthe bark of the hemp has become cloth, that of flax a princely lace\r\nworth some hundreds of francs by the piece.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                                 COTTON\r\n\r\n\r\n“COTTON, the most important of the materials used for our woven fabrics,\r\nis furnished by a semi-tropical plant called the cotton plant. It is an\r\nherb or even a shrub from one to two meters high, and its large yellow\r\nflowers are followed by an abundant fruitage of bolls, each as large as\r\nan egg, filled with a silky flock, sometimes brilliantly white,\r\nsometimes a pale yellowish shade, according to the kind of cotton. In\r\nthe middle of this flock are the seeds.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cotton Plant (_a_) Cotton Boll]\r\n\r\n\r\n“It seems to me I have seen flock of that kind fall in flakes in the\r\nspring from the top of poplars and willows,” said Claire.\r\n\r\n“The comparison is very good. Willows and poplars have for their fruit\r\ntiny little long and pointed bolls three or four times as large as a\r\npin’s head. In the month of May these bolls are ripe. They open and set\r\nfree a very fine white down, in the middle of which are the seeds. If\r\nthe air is calm, this down piles up at the foot of the tree in a bed of\r\ncotton wool, as white as snow; but at the least breath of wind the\r\nflakes are borne long distances, carrying with them the seeds, which\r\nthus find unoccupied places where they can germinate and become trees.\r\nMany other seeds are provided with soft aigrettes, silky plumes, which\r\nkeep them up in the air a long time and permit them distant journeys in\r\norder to disseminate the plant. For example, who is not familiar with\r\nthe seeds of thistles and dandelions, those beautiful silky plumed seeds\r\nthat you take pleasure in blowing into the air?”\r\n\r\n“Can the flock of poplar bolls be put to the same use as cotton?” Jules\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“By no means. There is too little of it, and it would be too difficult\r\nto gather. Besides, it is so short it might not be possible to spin it.\r\nBut if we ourselves cannot make use of it, others find it very useful.\r\nThis flock is the little birds’ cotton; many gather it to line their\r\nnests. The goldfinch, among others, is one of the cleverest of the\r\nclever. Its house of cotton is a masterpiece of elegance and solidity.\r\nIn the fork of several little branches, with the cottony flock of the\r\nwillow and poplar, with bits of wool that hedge thorns pull out from\r\nsheep as they pass, with the plumy aigrettes of thistle seeds, it makes\r\nfor its young a cup-shaped mattress, so soft and warm and wadded that no\r\nlittle prince in his swaddling-clothes ever had the like.\r\n\r\n“To build their nests, birds find materials near at hand; they only have\r\nto set to work. When spring comes, the goldfinch does not have to think\r\nof the materials for its nest; it is sure that the osier-beds, thistles,\r\nand roadside hedges will furnish in abundance all that it needs. And it\r\nought to be thus, for a bird has not the intelligence to prepare a long\r\ntime in advance, by careful and wise industry, the things that it will\r\nneed. Man, whose noble prerogative it is to acquire everything by work\r\nand reflection, procures cotton from distant countries; a bird finds its\r\ncotton on the poplars of its grove.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Picking cotton by hand]\r\n\r\n\r\n“At maturity the cotton bolls open wide, and their flock bursts out in\r\nsoft flakes that are gathered by hand, boll by boll. The flock, well\r\ndried in the sun on screens, is beaten with flails or, better, submitted\r\nto the action of certain machines. It is thus freed from all seeds and\r\nhusks. Without any other preparation, cotton comes to us in large bales\r\nto be converted into fabrics in our manufactories. The countries that\r\nfurnish the most of it are India, Egypt, Brazil, and, above all, the\r\nUnited States of North America.\r\n\r\n“In a single year the European manufactories work up nearly eight\r\nhundred million kilograms of cotton. This enormous weight is not too\r\nmuch, for the whole world clothes itself with the precious flock, turned\r\ninto print, percale, calico. Thus human activity has no greater field\r\nthan the cotton trade. How many workmen, how many delicate operations,\r\nwhat long voyages, all for a simple piece of print costing a few\r\ncentimes! A handful of cotton is gathered, we will suppose, two or three\r\nthousand leagues from here. This cotton crosses the ocean, goes a\r\nquarter round the globe, and comes to France or England to be\r\nmanufactured. Then it is spun, woven, ornamented with colored designs,\r\nand, converted into print, crosses the seas again, to go perhaps to the\r\nother end of the world to serve as head-dress for some woolly-haired\r\nnegro. What a multiplicity of interests are brought into play! It was\r\nnecessary to sow the plant; then, for a good half of the year, to\r\ncultivate it. Out of a handful of flock, then, provision must be made\r\nfor the remuneration of those who have cultivated and harvested. Next\r\ncome the dealer who buys and the mariner who transports it. To each of\r\nthem is due a part of the handful of flock. Then follow the spinner,\r\nweaver, dyer, all of whom the cotton must indemnify for their work. It\r\nis far from being finished. Now come other dealers who buy the fabrics,\r\nother mariners who carry them to all parts of the world, and finally\r\nmerchants who sell them at retail. How can the handful of flock pay all\r\nthese interested ones without itself acquiring an exorbitant price?\r\n\r\n“To accomplish this wonder two industrial powers intervene: work on a\r\nlarge scale and the aid of machinery. You have seen how Ambroisine spins\r\nwool on the wheel. The carded wool is first divided into long locks. One\r\nof these locks is applied to a hook which turns rapidly. The hook seizes\r\nthe wool and in its rotation twists the fibers into one thread, which\r\nlengthens little by little at the expense of the lock held and regulated\r\nby the fingers. When the thread attains a certain length, Mother\r\nAmbroisine rolls it on the spindle by a suitable movement of the wheel;\r\nthen she continues twisting the wool again.\r\n\r\n“Strictly speaking, cotton could be spun in the same way; but, however\r\nclever Mother Ambroisine may be, the fabrics made from the thread of her\r\nwheel would cost an enormous price on account of the time spent. What,\r\nthen, is to be done? A machine is made to spin the cotton. In rooms\r\nlarger than the biggest church are placed, by hundreds of thousands, the\r\nnicely adjusted machines proper for spinning, with hooks, spindles, and\r\nbobbins. And all turn at the same time with a precision and rapidity\r\nthat defy watching. The work goes on with noise enough to deafen you.\r\nThe flock of cotton is seized by thousands and thousands of hooks; the\r\nendless threads come and go from one bobbin to another, and roll\r\nthemselves on the spindles. In a few hours a mountain of cotton is\r\nconverted into thread, the length of which would go several times around\r\nthe whole earth. What have they spent for work which would have\r\nexhausted the strength of an army of spinners as clever as Mother\r\nAmbroisine? Some shovelfuls of coal to heat the water, the steam of\r\nwhich starts the machine that sets everything going. Weaving, the\r\nprinting of the colored designs,—in short, the various operations that\r\nthe flock undergoes to become cloth are executed by means quite as\r\nexpeditious, quite as economical. And it is thus that the planter,\r\nbroker, mariner, spinner, weaver, dyer, and merchant can all have their\r\nshare in the handful of cotton flock which has become a piece of calico\r\nand is sold for four sous.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                                 PAPER\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTHER AMBROISINE called Claire. A friend had just come to see her to\r\nlearn about an embroidery stitch that troubled her. At the request of\r\nJules and Emile, however, Uncle Paul continued. He knew Jules would take\r\npleasure in repeating the conversation to his sister.\r\n\r\n“Flax, hemp, and cotton, especially the last-named, have still another\r\nuse of great importance. First they clothe us; then, when too ragged to\r\nuse any more, they serve to make paper.”\r\n\r\n“Paper!” exclaimed Emile.\r\n\r\n“Paper, real paper, that on which we write, of which we make books. The\r\nbeautiful white sheets of your copybooks, the leaves of a book, even the\r\ncostliest, gilt-edged and enriched with magnificent pictures, come to us\r\nfrom miserable rags.\r\n\r\n“Despicable tatters are collected: some of them are picked up from the\r\nfilth of the street, some are unspeakably filthy. They are sorted over,\r\nthese for fine paper, those for coarse. They are thoroughly washed, for\r\nthey need it. Now machines take them in hand. Scissors cut them, steel\r\nclaws tear them, wheels make pulp of them and reduce them to shreds.\r\nMill-stones take them and grind them still more, then triturate them in\r\nwater, and convert them into a sort of soup. The pulp is gray, it must\r\nbe whitened. Then recourse is had to powerful drugs, which attack\r\neverything they touch, and in less than no time make it white as snow.\r\nBehold the pulpy mass thoroughly purified. Other machines spread it in\r\nthin layers on sieves. Water drips through, and the rag soup forms into\r\nfelt. Cylinders press this felt, others dry it, others give it a polish.\r\nThe paper is finished.\r\n\r\n“Before it became paper, the first material was rags, or cloth too\r\ntattered to use. How many uses has not this cloth served, and what\r\nenergetic treatments has it not undergone before being cast out as\r\nrubbish! Washing with corrosive ashes, contact with acrid soap, pounding\r\nwith a beetle, exposure to the sun, air, and rain. What is then this\r\nmaterial which, in spite of its delicacy, resists the brutalities of\r\nwashing, soap, sun, and air; which remains intact in the bosom of\r\nrottenness; which braves the machines and drugs of paper-making, and\r\nalways comes out of these ordeals more supple and whiter, to become at\r\nlast a sheet of paper, beautiful satiny paper, the confidant of our\r\nthoughts? You know now, my little friends, this admirable material,\r\nsource of so much intellectual progress, comes to us from the flock of\r\nthe cotton plant and the bark of hemp and flax.”\r\n\r\n“I am certainly going to surprise Claire,” said Jules, “when I tell her\r\nthat her beautiful prayer-book with the silver clasp was made from\r\nhorrid rags, perhaps from ragged handkerchiefs thrown away for rubbish,\r\nor from tatters picked up from the mud of the street.”\r\n\r\n“Claire will be interested to learn the nature of paper; but, I am sure,\r\nthe lowly origin of her prayer-book will not lessen the value of it in\r\nher mind. Skill performs a marvel in transforming despicable rags into a\r\nbook, depository of noble thoughts. God, my dear child, does\r\nincomparably more in the miracle of vegetation. The filth of the\r\ndung-hill, when buried in the soil, becomes transformed into the most\r\npleasing things in the world; for it becomes the rose, the lily, and\r\nother flowers. As for us, let us be like Claire’s book and the flowers\r\nof the good God: let us try to have real value in ourselves, and let us\r\nnever blush at our humble extraction. There is only one true greatness,\r\nonly one true nobility: greatness and nobility of the soul. If we\r\npossess them, the merit is all the greater by reason of our lowly\r\norigin.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                                THE BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n“NOW that I know what paper is made of,” said Jules, “I should like to\r\nknow how they make books.”\r\n\r\n“I could listen all day without getting tired,” Emile asserted. “For a\r\nstory I would leave my top and my soldiers.”\r\n\r\n“To make a book, my children, there is double work: first the labor of\r\nthe one who thinks and writes it, then the labor of the one who prints\r\nit. To think a book and write it under the sole dictation of one’s mind\r\nis a difficult and serious business. Brain-work exhausts our strength\r\nmuch more quickly than manual labor, for we must put the best of\r\nourselves into it, our soul. I tell you these things that you may see\r\nwhat gratitude you owe those who, solicitous for your future, think and\r\nwrite in order to teach you to think for yourselves and to free you from\r\nthe miseries of ignorance.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite convinced,” returned Jules, “of the difficulties to be\r\novercome in order to compose a book under the sole dictation of one’s\r\nmind; for when I want to write a letter of half a page to wish you a\r\nHappy New Year, I come to a full stop at the first word. How hard it is\r\nto find the first word! My head is heavy, my face flushes, and I can’t\r\nsee straight. I shall do better when I know my grammar well.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, my dear child, but I must undeceive you. Grammar cannot\r\nteach one to write. It teaches us to make a verb agree with its subject,\r\nan adjective with a substantive, and other things of that kind. It is\r\nvery useful, I admit, for nothing is more displeasing than to violate\r\nthe rules of language; but that does not impart the gift of writing.\r\nThere are people whose memories are crammed with rules of grammar, who,\r\nlike you, stop short at the first word.\r\n\r\n“Language is in some sort the clothing of thought. We cannot clothe what\r\ndoes not exist; we cannot speak or write what we do not find in our\r\nminds. Thought dictates and the pen writes. When the head is furnished\r\nwith ideas, and usage, still more than grammar, has taught us the rules\r\nof language, we have all that is necessary to write excellent things\r\ncorrectly. But, again, if ideas are wanting, if there is nothing in the\r\nhead, what can you write? How are these ideas to be acquired? By study,\r\nreading, and conversation with people better instructed than we.”\r\n\r\n“Then, in listening to all these fine things you tell us, I am no doubt\r\nlearning to write,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly, my little friend. Is it not true, for example, that if\r\nit had been proposed to you, a few days ago, to write only two lines\r\nabout the origin of paper, you would not have been able to do it? What\r\nwas wanting? Ideas and not grammar, although you know very little of\r\nthat yet.”\r\n\r\n“It is true, I was entirely ignorant what paper comes from. To-day I\r\nknow that cotton is a flock found in the bolls of a shrub called the\r\ncotton plant: I know that with this flock they make thread; then, after\r\nthe thread, cloth; I know that when the cloth gets old with use, it is\r\nreduced to pulp by machines, and that this pulp, stretched in very thin\r\nlayers and pressed, finally becomes a sheet of paper. I know these\r\nthings well, and yet I should find it very hard to write them.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, for all you need do is to put in writing exactly what\r\nyou have just told me.”\r\n\r\n“You write then just as you talk?” asked the boy, incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Yes, provided that speech is corrected, if necessary, on reflection,\r\nsince writing gives time for it, whereas talking does not.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, I should soon have my five lines on paper. I should\r\nwrite: ‘Cotton is a flock that is found in the bolls of a shrub called\r\nthe cotton plant. With this flock they make thread; and with this\r\nthread, cloth. When the cloth is worn out, machines tear it into little\r\npieces, and mill-stones grind it with water to make it into a pulp. This\r\npulp is stretched in thin layers which are pressed and dried. Then it is\r\npaper.’ There! Is that right, Uncle?”\r\n\r\n“As well as one could wish from one of your age,” his uncle assured him.\r\n\r\n“But that could not be put into a book.”\r\n\r\n“And why not? I promise you that shall be in a book some day. It has\r\nbeen said to me that our talks might be useful to many other little boys\r\nas desirous to learn as you, and I propose to collect them in all their\r\nsimplicity and make a book of them.”\r\n\r\n“A book where I could read at leisure the stories that you tell us? Oh,\r\nhow pleased I am, Uncle, and how I love you! You won’t put my ignorant\r\nquestions in that book?”\r\n\r\n“I shall put them all in. You know next to nothing now, my dear child,\r\nbut you ardently desire to learn. That is a fine quality, and a very\r\nbecoming one.”\r\n\r\n“Are you at least sure that the little boys who read this book will not\r\nlaugh at me?”\r\n\r\n“I am sure.”\r\n\r\n“Tell them then that I love them well and embrace them all.”\r\n\r\n“Tell them I wish them as good a top and as fine lead soldiers as those\r\nyou gave me,” put in Emile.\r\n\r\n“Take care, Emile,” cautioned his brother. “Uncle may put your lead\r\nsoldiers in the book.”\r\n\r\n“They will be there, they are there.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                                PRINTING\r\n\r\n\r\n“AFTER a book is written, the author sends his work, his manuscript, to\r\nthe printer, who is to reproduce it in printed letters and in as many\r\ncopies as are desired.\r\n\r\n“Picture to yourself fine and short metal sticks, on the end of each of\r\nwhich is carved in relief a letter of the alphabet. One of these sticks\r\nhas an _a_ on the end, another a _b_, another a _c_, etc. There are\r\nothers which have a full-stop, a comma, a semi-colon; in fact, there are\r\nas many distinct kinds of these little metal pieces as there are letters\r\nand orthographic signs in our written language. Besides, each letter and\r\neach sign are represented a great many times. Let us take note, too,\r\nthat all these characters are carved wrong side before; you will soon\r\nsee the reason.\r\n\r\n“A workman called a compositor has before him a stand of cases, of which\r\neach compartment is occupied by a single letter of the alphabet, or by\r\nan orthographic sign. The _a_’s are in such a compartment, the _b_’s in\r\na second, the _c_’s in a third, and so on. The letters, furthermore, are\r\nnot arranged in the case alphabetically. To shorten the work, they put\r\nin the compartments near to hand the letters that occur most frequently,\r\nsuch as the _e_’s, _r_’s, _i_’s, _a_’s; and they place in the more\r\ndistant compartments the letters less often used, such as _x_’s and\r\n_y_’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An old fashioned Hand Press]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The compositor has before him a manuscript, and at his left hand a\r\nlittle flanged iron ruler called a composing-stick. As he reads, his\r\nright hand, guided by long habit, searches in the case the desired\r\nletter and places it in the composing-stick, upright and in a row with\r\nthe others. He separates the words by means of a metal stick like those\r\nof the letters, but the end of which remains depressed and does not bear\r\nany carving. The first line finished, the compositor begins another by\r\nsetting a new row of little metal pieces next to the row already\r\nfinished. Finally, when the composing-stick is full, the workman\r\ncautiously places the contents in an iron frame, which keeps the\r\ndelicate combination from going to pieces; and he continues thus until\r\nthe frame is quite full and we have what is called the printing-bed.\r\nThis plate is composed of a multitude of little metal sticks, simply\r\nplaced side by side. There are as many of these as there are letters,\r\northographic signs, and spaces separating the words. The arrangement of\r\nthese numerous bits of metal is a masterpiece that a false movement\r\nmight ruin. It is held firm in its iron frame by means of wedges, so\r\nthat the whole thing seems made of a single block of metal. The bed is\r\nthen ready for printing.\r\n\r\n“A roller impregnated with a thick ink made of oil and lampblack is\r\npassed over the plate. The letters and orthographic signs, which alone\r\nstand out in relief, become covered with ink; the rest does not take it\r\nbecause its surface is lower. A sheet of paper is placed on the inked\r\nplate; it is covered with a pad to protect it, then pressed hard. The\r\nink of the characters is deposited on the paper, and the sheet is found\r\nprinted on one side. To print the other, the operation is repeated with\r\na second plate. The metal letters are, as I said, carved wrong side\r\nbefore, as the letters of a book appear when you look at them in a\r\nmirror. The inky imprint left by them on the paper reproduces them in a\r\nreversed position, and consequently in the right way.\r\n\r\n“The first sheet is followed immediately by a second. With the roller\r\nthe plate is inked again, a sheet of paper is applied, pressure is\r\nexerted, and it is done. Then comes a third sheet, a hundredth, a\r\nthousandth, indefinitely. All that is needed each time is to ink the\r\nplate, cover it with paper, then press. All this is done with such\r\nrapidity that in a short time we have a great pile of printed sheets,\r\neach of which it would take a whole day to write by hand.\r\n\r\n“Before the invention of this marvelous art, which enables us to\r\nreproduce the works of the mind very rapidly and in as great numbers as\r\nmay be desired, we were restricted to hand-made copies. These manuscript\r\nbooks required years of work, and hence were very rare and high-priced.\r\nLarge fortunes were necessary to acquire a library of several volumes.\r\nTo-day books find their way everywhere, spreading in profusion, even\r\namong the lowest classes, the sacred bread of intelligence. Printing has\r\nbeen known for four hundred years: its invention is due to Gutenberg.”\r\n\r\n“That is a name I shall never forget,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“It deserves, above all, to be remembered, for with the printed book\r\nGutenberg rendered impossible henceforth the ignorant times through\r\nwhich man has miserably passed. Our intellectual treasures, resources\r\nfor the future, are better than engraved on stone or metal; they are\r\ninscribed on sheets of paper, in copies too numerous to be all\r\ndestroyed.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                              BUTTERFLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nOH, how beautiful! Oh, my goodness, how beautiful they are! There are\r\nsome whose wings are barred with red on a garnet background; some bright\r\nblue with black circles; others are sulphur-yellow with orange spots;\r\nagain others are white fringed with gold-color. They have on the\r\nforehead two fine horns, two antennæ, sometimes fringed like an\r\naigrette, sometimes cut off like a tuft of feathers. Under the head they\r\nhave a proboscis, a sucker as fine as a hair and twisted into a spiral.\r\nWhen they approach a flower, they untwist the proboscis and plunge it to\r\nthe bottom of the corolla to drink a drop of honeyed liquor. Oh, how\r\nbeautiful they are! Oh, my goodness, how beautiful they are! But if one\r\nmanages to touch them, their wings tarnish and leave between the fingers\r\na fine dust like that of precious metals.\r\n\r\nNow their uncle told the children the names of the butterflies that flew\r\non the flowers in the garden. “This one,” said he, “whose wings are\r\nwhite with a black border and three black spots, is called the cabbage\r\nbutterfly. This larger one, whose yellow wings barred with black\r\nterminate in a long tail, at the base of which are found a large rust\r\ncolored eye and blue spots, is called the swallow-tail. This tiny one,\r\nsky-blue above, silver-gray underneath, sprinkled with black eyes in\r\nwhite circles, with a line of reddish spots bordering the wings, is\r\ncalled the Argus.”\r\n\r\nAnd Uncle Paul continued thus, naming the butterflies that a bright sun\r\nhad drawn to the flowers.\r\n\r\n“The Argus ought to be difficult to catch,” observed Emile. “He sees\r\neverywhere; his wings are covered with eyes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Female and Male Cabbage Butterfly]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The pretty round spots that a great many butterflies have on their\r\nwings are not really eyes, although they are called by that name; they\r\nare ornaments, nothing more. Real eyes, eyes for seeing, are in the\r\nhead. The Argus has two, neither more nor fewer than the other\r\nbutterflies.”\r\n\r\n“Claire tells me,” said Jules, “that butterflies come from caterpillars.\r\nIs it true, Uncle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my child. Every butterfly, before becoming the graceful creature\r\nwhich flies from flower to flower with magnificent wings, is an ugly\r\ncaterpillar that creeps with effort. Thus the cabbage butterfly, which I\r\nhave just shown you, is first a green caterpillar, which stays on the\r\ncabbages and gnaws the leaves. Jacques will tell you how much pains he\r\ntakes to protect his cabbage patch from the voracious insect; for, you\r\nsee, caterpillars have a terrible appetite. You will soon learn the\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n“Most insects behave like caterpillars. On coming out of the egg, they\r\nhave a provisional form that they must replace later by another. They\r\nare, as it were, born twice: first imperfect, dull, voracious, ugly;\r\nthen perfect, agile, abstemious, and often of an admirable richness and\r\nelegance. Under its first form, the insect is a worm called by the\r\ngeneral name of _larva_.\r\n\r\n“You remember the lion of the plant-lice, the grub that eats the lice of\r\nthe rosebush and, for weeks, without being able to satisfy itself,\r\ncontinues night and day its ferocious feasting. Well, this grub is a\r\nlarva, that will change itself into a little lace-winged fly, the\r\n_hemerobius_, whose wings are of gauze and eyes of gold. Before becoming\r\nthe pretty red ladybird with black spots, this pretty insect, which, in\r\nspite of its innocent air, crunches the plant-lice, is a very ugly worm,\r\na slate-colored larva, covered with little points, and itself very fond\r\nof plant-lice. The June bug, the silly June bug, which, if its leg is\r\nheld by a thread, awkwardly puffs out its wings, makes all preparations,\r\nand starts out to the tune of ‘Fly, fly, fly!’ is at first a white worm,\r\na plump larva, fat as bacon, which lives under-ground, attacks the roots\r\nof plants, and destroys our crops. The big stag-beetle, whose head is\r\narmed with menacing mandibles shaped like the stag’s horns, is at first\r\na large worm that lives in old tree-trunks. It is the same with the\r\ncapricorn, so peculiar for its long antennæ. And the worm found in our\r\nripe cherries, which is so repugnant to us, what does it become? It\r\nbecomes a beautiful fly, its wings adorned with four bands of black\r\nvelvet. And so on with others.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Red-humped Apple Tree “Caterpillar” (_a_) moth; (_b_)\r\ncaterpillar natural size]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, this initial state of the insect, this worm, first form of youth,\r\nis called the larva. The wonderful change which transforms the larva\r\ninto a perfect insect is called metamorphosis. Caterpillars are larvæ.\r\nBy metamorphosis they turn into those beautiful butterflies whose wings,\r\ndecorated with the richest colors, fill us with admiration. The Argus,\r\nnow so beautiful with its celestial blue wings, was first a poor hairy\r\ncaterpillar; the splendid swallow-tail began by being a green\r\ncaterpillar with black stripes across it and red spots on its sides. Out\r\nof these despicable vermin metamorphosis has made those delightful\r\ncreatures which only the flowers can rival in elegance.\r\n\r\n“You all know the tale of Cinderella. The sisters have left for the\r\nball, very proud, very smart. Cinderella, her heart full, is watching\r\nthe kettle. The godmother arrives. ‘Go,’ says she, ‘to the garden and\r\nget a pumpkin.’ And behold, the scooped-out pumpkin changes under the\r\ngodmother’s wand, into a gilded carriage. ‘Cinderella,’ says she again,\r\n‘open the mouse-trap.’ Six mice run out of it, and are no sooner touched\r\nby the magic wand than they turn into six beautiful dappled-gray horses.\r\nA bearded rat becomes a big coachman with a commanding mustache. Six\r\nlizards sleeping behind the watering-pot become green bedizened footmen,\r\nwho immediately jump up behind the carriage. Finally the poor girl’s\r\nshabby clothes are changed to gold and silver ones sprinkled with\r\nprecious stones. Cinderella starts for the ball, in glass slippers. You,\r\napparently, know the rest of it better than I.\r\n\r\n“These powerful godmothers for whom it is play to change mice into\r\nhorses, lizards into footmen, ugly clothes into sumptuous ones, these\r\ngracious fairies who astonish you with their fabulous prodigies, what\r\nare they, my dear children, in comparison with reality, the great fairy\r\nof the good God, who, out of a dirty worm, object of disgust, knows how\r\nto make a creature of ravishing beauty! He touches with his divine wand\r\na miserable hairy caterpillar, an abject worm that slobbers in rotten\r\nwood, and the miracle is accomplished: the disgusting larva has turned\r\ninto a beetle all shining with gold, a butterfly whose azure wings would\r\nhave outshone Cinderella’s fine toilette.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                             THE BIG EATERS\r\n\r\n\r\n“INSECTS propagate themselves by eggs, which they lay, with admirable\r\nforesight, where the young will be sure to find nourishment. The little\r\ncreature that comes from the egg is a larva, a feeble grub, which, most\r\noften, has to shift for itself, procure at its own risk food and\r\nshelter—the most difficult thing in this world. In these painful\r\nbeginnings it cannot expect any help from its mother, dead some time\r\nbefore; for in insect life the parents generally die before the hatching\r\nof the eggs that produce the young. Without delay the little larva sets\r\nto work. It eats. It is its sole business, and a serious one, on which\r\nits future depends. It eats, not only to keep up its strength from day\r\nto day, but above all to acquire the plumpness necessary for its future\r\nmetamorphosis. I must tell you—and this perhaps will surprise you—that\r\nan insect ceases to grow after attaining its final perfect form. It is\r\nknown, too, that there are insects—among others, the butterfly of the\r\nsilkworm—that do not take any nourishment at all.\r\n\r\n“A cat is at first a tiny little pink-nosed creature, so small that it\r\ncould rest in the hollow of the hand. In one or two months it is a\r\npretty kitten that amuses itself at a mere nothing, and with its nimble\r\npaw whips the wisp of paper that one throws before it. Another year, and\r\nit is a tom-cat that patiently watches for mice or joins battle with its\r\nrivals on the roof. But, whether a tiny creature hardly able to open its\r\nlittle blue eyes, or a pretty playful kitten, or a big quarrelsome\r\ntom-cat, it has always the form of a cat.\r\n\r\n“It is otherwise with insects. The swallow-tail, under its form of\r\nbutterfly, is not first small, then medium, then large. When, for the\r\nfirst time, it opens its wings and takes flight, it is as large as it\r\never will be. When it comes out from under ground, where it lived as a\r\ngrub, when for the first time it appears in the daylight, the June bug\r\nis such as you know it. There are little cats, but no little\r\nswallow-tails nor little June bugs. After the metamorphosis, an insect\r\nis what it will be to the end.”\r\n\r\n“But I have seen small June bugs flying round the willows in the\r\nevening,” objected Jules.\r\n\r\n“Those little June bugs are of a different kind. They will always remain\r\nthe same. Never will they grow and become common June bugs, any more\r\nthan a cat would grow into a tiger, which it resembles so much.\r\n\r\n“The grub alone grows. At first very small on coming out of the egg,\r\nlittle by little it acquires a size in conformity with the future\r\ninsect. It gathers the materials that the metamorphosis will\r\nuse,—materials for the wings, antennæ, legs, and all those things that\r\nthe larva does not have, but that the insect must have. Out of what will\r\nthe big green worm that lives in dead wood, and must some day become a\r\nstag-beetle, make the enormous branched mandibles and the robust horny\r\ncovering of the perfect insect? Of what will the larva make the long\r\nantennæ of the capricorn? Of what will the caterpillar make the large\r\nwings of the swallow-tail? Of that which the caterpillar, larva, and\r\nworm amass now, with thrifty hoarding of life-supporting matter.\r\n\r\n“If the little pink-nosed cat were born without ears, paws, tail, fur,\r\nmustaches, if it were simply a little ball of flesh, and should some day\r\nhave to acquire all at once, while asleep, ears, paws, tail, fur,\r\nmustaches, and many other things, is it not true that this work of life\r\nwould necessitate materials gathered together beforehand and held in\r\nreserve in the fatty tissues of the animal? No thing can be made from\r\nnothing; the smallest hair of the cat’s mustache shoots forth at the\r\nexpense of the substance of the animal, substance which it acquires by\r\neating.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Goat Moth]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The larva is in precisely this case: it has nothing, or next to\r\nnothing, that the perfect insects must have. It must therefore amass, in\r\nview of future changes, materials for the change; it must eat for two:\r\nfor itself first, and then for the insect that will come from its\r\nsubstance, transformed and, in a sense, recast. So the larvæ are endowed\r\nwith an incomparable appetite. As I have said, to eat is their sole\r\nbusiness. They eat night and day, often without stopping, without taking\r\nbreath. To lose a mouthful, what imprudence! The future butterfly would\r\nperhaps have one scale less to its wings. So they eat gluttonously, take\r\non a stomach, become big, fat, plump. It is the duty of larvæ.\r\n\r\n“Some attack plants; they browse on the leaves, chew the flowers, bite\r\nthe flesh of fruit. Others have a stomach strong enough to digest wood;\r\nthey hollow out galleries in the tree-trunks, file off, grate, pulverize\r\nthe hardest oak, as well as the tender willow. Others, again, prefer\r\ndecomposed animal matter; they haunt infected corpses, fill their\r\nstomachs with rottenness. Still others seek excrement and feast on\r\nfilth. They are all scavengers on whom has developed the high mission of\r\ncleansing the earth of its pollution. You would sicken at the mere\r\nthought of these worms that swarm in pus; yet one of the most important\r\nservices, a providential service, is rendered by these disgusting eaters\r\nwhich clear away infection and give back its constituent elements to\r\nlife. As if to make amends for its filthy needs, one of these larvæ will\r\nlater be a magnificent fly, rivaling polished bronze in its brilliancy;\r\nanother, a beetle perfumed with musk, its rich coat vying with gold and\r\nprecious stones in splendor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Phylloxera]\r\n\r\n\r\n“But these larvæ devoted to the work of general sanitation cannot make\r\nus forget other eaters, of whom we are victims. The grubs of the June\r\nbug alone sometimes multiply so rapidly in the ground that immense\r\ntracts are denuded of vegetation, which is gnawed at the roots. The\r\nforester’s shrubs, the farmer’s harvests, the gardener’s plants, just\r\nwhen everything seems prosperous, some fine morning, hang withered,\r\nsmitten to death. The worm has passed that way, and all is lost. Fire\r\ncould not have committed more frightful ravages. A miserable yellow\r\nlouse, hardly visible, lives under ground, where it attacks the roots of\r\nthe grape vine. It is called _phylloxera_. Its calamitous breed\r\nthreatens to destroy all our vineyards. Some grubs, small enough to\r\nlodge in a grain of wheat, ravage the wheat in our granaries and leave\r\nonly the bran. Others browse the lucerne so that the mower finds nothing\r\nleft. Others, for years, gnaw at the heart of the wood of the oak,\r\npoplar, pine, and divers, other large trees. Others, which turn into\r\nthose little white butterflies flying around the lamp in the evening and\r\ncalled moths, eat our cloth stuffs bit by bit, and finish by reducing\r\nthem to rags. Others attack wainscoting, old furniture, and reduce them\r\nto powder. Others—But I should never get through if I were to tell you\r\nall. This little people to which we often disdain to pay the slightest\r\nattention, this little race of insects, is so powerful on account of the\r\nrobust appetite of its larvæ, that man ought seriously to reckon with\r\nit. If a certain grub succeeds in multiplying beyond measure, whole\r\nprovinces are threatened with the tragic fate of starvation. And we are\r\nleft in perfect ignorance on the subject of these devourers! How can you\r\ndefend yourself if the enemy is unknown to you? Ah, if I only had the\r\nmanagement of these things! As for you, my dear children, while waiting\r\nfor our talks to be resumed with more detail concerning these ravagers,\r\nremember this: the larvæ of insects are the great eaters of this world,\r\nthe providential demolishers that finish the work of death and thus\r\nprepare for the work of life, since everything, or nearly everything\r\npasses through their stomach.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                                  SILK\r\n\r\n\r\n“SOONER or later, according to its species, a day comes when the larva\r\nfeels itself strong enough to face the perils of metamorphosis. It has\r\nvaliantly done its duty, since to stuff its paunch is the duty of a\r\nworm; it has eaten for two, itself and the matured insect. Now it is\r\nadvisable to renounce feasting, retire from the world, and prepare\r\nitself a quiet shelter for the death-like sleep during which its second\r\nbirth takes place. A thousand methods are employed for the preparation\r\nof this lodging.\r\n\r\n“Certain larvæ simply bury themselves in the ground, others hollow out\r\nround niches with polished sides. There are some that make themselves a\r\ncase out of dry leaves; there are others that know how to glue together\r\na hollow ball out of grains of sand or rotten wood or loam. Those that\r\nlive in tree-trunks stop up with plugs of sawdust both ends of the\r\ngalleries they have hollowed out; those that live in wheat gnaw all the\r\nfarinaceous part of the grain, scrupulously leaving untouched the\r\noutside, or bran, which is to serve them as cradle. Others, with less\r\nprecaution, shelter themselves in some crack of the bark or of a wall,\r\nand fasten themselves there by a string which goes round their body. To\r\nthis number belong the caterpillars of the cabbage butterfly and the\r\nswallow-tail. But especially in the making of the silk cell called\r\ncocoon is the highest skill of the larvæ shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silk Worm Eggs, worm, cocoon, and butterfly]\r\n\r\n\r\n“An ashy white caterpillar, the size of the little finger, is raised in\r\nlarge numbers for its cocoon, with which silk stuffs are made. It is\r\ncalled the silkworm. In very clean rooms are placed reed screens, on\r\nwhich they put mulberry leaves, and the young caterpillars come from\r\neggs hatched in the house. The mulberry is a large tree cultivated on\r\npurpose to nourish these caterpillars; it has no value except for its\r\nleaves, the sole food of silkworms. Large tracts are devoted to its\r\ncultivation, so precious is the handiwork of the worm. The caterpillars\r\neat the ration of leaves that is frequently renewed on the screens, and\r\nfrom time to time change their skin, according to their rate of growth.\r\nTheir appetite is such that the clicking of their jaws is like the noise\r\nof a shower falling during a calm on the foliage of the trees. It is\r\ntrue that the room contains thousands and thousands of worms. The\r\ncaterpillar gets its growth in four or five weeks. Then the screens are\r\nset with sprigs of heather, on which the worms climb when the time comes\r\nfor them to spin their cocoons. They settle themselves one by one amid\r\nthe sprigs and fasten here and there a multitude of very fine threads,\r\nso as to make a kind of network which will hold them suspended and serve\r\nthem as scaffolding for the great work of the cocoon.\r\n\r\n“The silk thread comes out of the under lip, through a hole called the\r\nspinneret. In the body of the caterpillar the silk material is a very\r\nthick, sticky liquid, resembling gum. In coming through the opening of\r\nthe lip, this liquid is drawn out into a thread, which glues itself to\r\nthe preceding threads and immediately hardens. The silk matter is not\r\nentirely contained in the mulberry leaf that the worm eats, any more\r\nthan is milk in the grass that the cow browses. The caterpillar makes it\r\nout of the materials of its food, just as the cow makes milk of the\r\nconstituents of her forage. Without the caterpillar’s help man could\r\nnever extract from the mulberry leaves the material for his costliest\r\nfabrics. Our most beautiful silk stuffs really take birth in the worm\r\nthat drivels them into a thread.\r\n\r\n“Let us return to the caterpillar suspended in the midst of its net. Now\r\nit is working at the cocoon. Its head is in continual motion. It\r\nadvances, retires, ascends, descends, goes to right and left, while\r\nletting escape from its lip a tiny thread, which rolls itself loosely\r\naround the animal, sticks itself to the thread already in place, and\r\nfinishes by forming a continuous envelope the size of a pigeon’s egg.\r\nThe silken structure is at first transparent enough to permit one to see\r\nthe caterpillar at work; but as it grows thicker what passes within is\r\nsoon hidden from view. What follows can easily be guessed. For three or\r\nfour days the caterpillar continues to thicken the walls of the cocoon\r\nuntil it has exhausted its store of liquid silk. Here it is at last,\r\nretired from the world, isolated, tranquil, ready for the\r\ntransfiguration so soon to take place. Its whole life, its long life of\r\na month, it has worked in anticipation of the metamorphosis; it has\r\ncrammed itself with mulberry leaves, has extenuated itself to make the\r\nsilk for its cocoon, but thus it is going to become a butterfly. What a\r\nsolemn moment for the caterpillar!\r\n\r\n“Ah! my children, I had almost forgotten man’s part in all this. Hardly\r\nis the work of the cocoon finished when he runs to the heather sprig,\r\nlays violent hands on the cocoons and sells them to the manufacturer.\r\nThe latter, without delay, puts them into an oven and subjects them to\r\nthe action of burning vapor to kill the future butterfly, whose tender\r\nflesh is beginning to form. If he delayed, the butterfly would pierce\r\nthe cocoon, which, no longer capable of being unwound on account of its\r\nbroken threads, would lose its value. This precaution taken, the rest is\r\ndone at leisure. The cocoons are unwound in factories called spinning\r\nmills. They are put into a pan of boiling water to dissolve the gum\r\nwhich holds the successive windings together. A workwoman armed with a\r\nlittle heather broom stirs them in the water, in order to find and seize\r\nthe end of the thread, which she puts on a revolving reel. Under the\r\naction of the machine the thread of silk unwinds while the cocoon jumps\r\nabout in the hot water like a ball of wool when one pulls the yarn.\r\n\r\n“In the center of the threadbare cocoon is the chrysalis, scorched and\r\nkilled by the fire. Later the silk undergoes divers operations which\r\ngive it more suppleness and luster; it passes into the dyer’s vats where\r\nit takes any color desired; finally it is woven and converted into\r\nfabric.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                           THE METAMORPHOSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n“ONCE inclosed in its cocoon, the caterpillar withers and shrivels up,\r\nas if dying. First, the skin splits on the back; then, by repeated\r\nconvulsions that pull it this way and that, the worm with much\r\ndifficulty tears off its skin. With the skin comes everything: the case\r\nof the skull, jaws, eyes, legs, stomach and the rest. It is a general\r\ntearing-off. The ragged covering of the old body is finally pushed into\r\na corner of the cocoon.\r\n\r\n“What do they find then in the cells of silk? Another caterpillar, a\r\nbutterfly? Neither. They find an almond shaped body, rounded at one end,\r\npointed at the other, of a leathery appearance, and called a chrysalis.\r\nIt is an intermediate state between the caterpillar and the butterfly.\r\nThere can be seen certain projections which already indicate the shape\r\nof the future insect: at the large end can be distinguished the antennæ\r\nand the wings tightly folded crosswise on the chrysalis.\r\n\r\n“The larvæ of the June bug, capricorn, stag-beetle, and other beetles\r\npass through a similar state, but with more accentuated forms. The\r\ndifferent parts of the head, wings, legs delicately folded at their\r\nsides, are very recognizable. But all is immobile, soft, white, or even\r\ntransparent as crystal. This insect in outline is called a nymph. The\r\nname of chrysalis used for butterflies and that of nymph used for the\r\nother insects signify the same thing under somewhat different\r\nappearances. Both the chrysalis and the nymph are insects in process of\r\nformation—insects closely wrapped in swaddling-clothes, under which is\r\nfinished the mysterious operation that will change their first structure\r\nfrom top to bottom.\r\n\r\n“In a couple of weeks, if the temperature is favorable, the chrysalis of\r\nthe silkworm opens like a ripe fruit, and from its burst shell the\r\nbutterfly escapes, all ragged, moist, scarcely able to stand on its\r\ntrembling legs. Open air is necessary for it to gain strength, to spread\r\nand dry its wings. It must get out of the cocoon. But how? The\r\ncaterpillar has made the cocoon so solid and the butterfly is so weak!\r\nWill it perish in its prison, the poor little thing? It would not be\r\nworth the trouble of going through so much to stifle miserably in the\r\nclose cell, just as the end is attained!”\r\n\r\n“Could it not tear the cocoon open with its teeth?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“But, my innocent child, it has none, nor anything like them. It has\r\nonly a proboscis, incapable of the slightest effort.”\r\n\r\n“With its claws then?” suggested Jules.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if it had any strong enough. The trouble is, it is not provided\r\nwith any.”\r\n\r\n“But it must be able to get out,” persisted Jules.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless it will get out. Has not every creature resources in the\r\ndifficult moments of life! To break the hen’s egg that imprisons it, the\r\ntiny little chicken has at the end of its beak a little hard point made\r\non purpose; and the butterfly is to have nothing to open its cocoon? Oh,\r\nyes! But you would never guess the singular tool that it will use. It\r\nwill use its eyes—”\r\n\r\n“Its eyes?” interrupted Claire in amazement.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Insects’ eyes are covered with a cap of transparent horn, hard and\r\ncut in facets. A magnifying glass is needed in order to distinguish\r\nthese facets, they are so fine; but, fine as they are, they have sharp\r\nbones which all together can, in time of need, be used as a grater. The\r\nbutterfly begins then by moistening with a drop of saliva the point of\r\nthe cocoon it wishes to attack, and then, applying an eye to the spot\r\nthus softened, it writhes, knocks, scratches, files. One by one the\r\nthreads of silk succumb to the rasping. The hole is made, the butterfly\r\ncomes out. What do you think about it? Do not animals sometimes have\r\nintelligence enough for four? Which of us would have thought of forcing\r\nthe prison walls by striking them with the eye?”\r\n\r\n“The butterfly must have studied a long time to think of that ingenious\r\nway?” queried Emile.\r\n\r\n“The butterfly does not study, does not reflect; it knows at once what\r\nto do and how to do well whatever concerns it. Another has reflected for\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“God himself! God, the great wise one. The silkworm butterfly is not\r\npretty. It is whitish, tun-bellied, heavy. It does not fly like the\r\nothers from flower to flower, for it takes no nourishment. As soon as it\r\nis out of the cocoon, it sets to work laying eggs; then it dies.\r\nSilkworm eggs are commonly called seed, a very good term, for the egg is\r\nthe seed of the animal as the seed is the egg of the plant. Egg and seed\r\ncorrespond. They do not stifle all the cocoons in the vapor to wind them\r\nafterwards; they keep out a certain number so as to obtain butterflies\r\nand consequently eggs or seeds. These are the seeds which, the following\r\nyear, produce the fresh brood of worms.\r\n\r\n“All insects that are metamorphosed pass through the four states that I\r\nhave just told you about: egg, larva, chrysalis or nymph, perfect\r\ninsect. The perfect insect lays its eggs, and the series of\r\ntransformations begins again.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                                SPIDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nONE morning, Mother Ambroisine was chopping herbs and cooked apples for\r\na brood of little chickens hatched not long before. A large gray spider,\r\nletting itself slide the length of its thread, descended from the\r\nceiling to the good woman’s shoulders. At sight of the creature with\r\nlong velvety legs, Mother Ambroisine could not suppress a cry of fear,\r\nand, shaking her shoulder, made the insect fall, and crushed it under\r\nher foot. “Spider in the morning stands for mourning,” said she to\r\nherself. At this instant Uncle Paul and Claire entered.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spider]\r\n\r\n\r\n“No, sir, it is not right,” said Mother Ambroisine, “that we poor\r\nmortals should have so much useless trouble. Twelve little chickens are\r\nhatched out for us, bright as gold; and just as I am preparing them\r\nsomething to eat, a villainous spider falls on my shoulder.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mother Ambroisine pointed with her finger at the crushed insect with\r\nits legs still trembling.\r\n\r\n“I do not see that those little chickens have anything to fear from the\r\nspider,” remarked Uncle Paul.\r\n\r\n“Oh! nothing, sir: the horrid creature is dead. But you know the\r\nproverb: ‘Spider in the morning, mourning; spider at night, delight.’\r\nEverybody knows that a spider seen in the morning is a sign of bad luck.\r\nOur little chickens are in danger; the cats will claw them. You’ll see,\r\nsir, you’ll see.”\r\n\r\nTears of emotion came to Mother Ambroisine’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“Put the little chickens in a safe place, watch the cats, and I will\r\nanswer for the rest. The proverb of the spider is only a foolish\r\nprejudice,” said Uncle Paul.\r\n\r\nMother Ambroisine did not utter another word. She knew that Maître Paul\r\nfound a reason for everything, and on occasion was capable of\r\npronouncing a eulogy on the spider. Claire, who saw this eulogy coming,\r\nventured a question.\r\n\r\n“I know: in your eyes all animals, however hideous they may be, have\r\nexcellent excuses to plead: all merit consideration; all play a part\r\nordained by Providence; all are interesting to observe and to study. You\r\nare the advocate of the good God’s creatures; you would plead for the\r\ntoad. But permit your niece to see there only an impulse of your kind\r\nheart, and not the real truth. What could you say in praise of the\r\nspider, horrid beast, which is poisonous and disfigures the ceiling with\r\nits webs?”\r\n\r\n“What could I say? Much, my dear child, much. In the meantime, feed your\r\nlittle chickens and beware of cats if you want to prove the spider\r\nproverb false.”\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mother Ambroisine, her large round spectacles on her\r\nnose, was knitting stockings. On her knees the cat slept and mingled its\r\npurring with the tick-tack of the needles. The children were waiting for\r\nthe story of the spider. Their uncle began.\r\n\r\n“Which of you three can tell me what spiders do with their webs, those\r\nfine webs stretched in the corners of the granary or between two shrubs\r\nin the garden!”\r\n\r\nEmile spoke first. “It is their nest, Uncle, their house, their\r\nhiding-place.”\r\n\r\n“Hiding-place!” exclaimed Jules; “yes, I think it is more than that. One\r\nday I heard, between the lilac branches, a little shrill\r\nnoise-_he-e-e-e!_ A blue fly was entangled in a cobweb and trying to\r\nescape. It was the fly that was making the noise with its fluttering. A\r\nspider ran from the bottom of the silken funnel, seized the fly, and\r\ncarried it off to its hole, doubtless to eat it. Since then I have\r\nthought spiders’ webs were hunting nets.”\r\n\r\n“That is even so,” said his uncle. “All spiders live on live prey; they\r\nmake continual war on flies, gnats, and other insects. If you fear\r\nmosquitoes, those insufferable little insects that sting us at night\r\nuntil they bring blood, you must bless the spider, for it does its best\r\nto rid us of them. To catch game, a net is necessary. Now, the net to\r\ncatch flies in their flight is a cloth woven with silk, which the spider\r\nitself produces.\r\n\r\n“In the body of the insect the silky matter is, as with caterpillars, a\r\nsticky liquid resembling glue or gum. As soon as it comes in contact\r\nwith the air, this matter congeals, hardens, and becomes a thread on\r\nwhich water has no effect. When the spider wants to spin, the silk\r\nliquid flows from four nipples, called spinnerets, placed at the end of\r\nthe stomach. These nipples are pierced at their extremity by a number of\r\nholes, like the sprinkler of a watering-pot. The number of these holes\r\nfor all the nipples is roughly reckoned as a thousand. Each one lets its\r\ntiny little jet of liquid flow, which hardens and becomes thread; and\r\nfrom a thousand threads stuck together into one results the final thread\r\nemployed by the spider. To designate something very fine there is no\r\nbetter term of comparison than the spider’s thread. It is so delicate,\r\nin fact, that it can only just be seen. Our silk threads, those of the\r\nfinest textures, are cables in comparison, cables of two, three, four\r\nstrands, while this one, in its unequaled tenuity, contains a thousand.\r\nHow many spiders’ threads are required to make a strand of the thickness\r\nof a hair! Not far from ten. And how many elementary threads, such as\r\nissue from the separate holes of the spinneret! Ten thousand. To what a\r\ndegree of tenuity then this silky matter can be reduced that stretches\r\nout in threads of which it takes ten thousand to equal the size of one\r\nhair! What marvels, my children, and only to catch a fly that is to\r\nserve for the spider’s dinner!”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                          THE EPEIRA’S BRIDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE Uncle Paul caught Claire looking at him thoughtfully. It was\r\nevident that some change was taking place in her mind: the spider was no\r\nlonger a repulsive creature, unworthy of our regard. Uncle Paul\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n“With its legs, armed with sharp-toothed little claws like combs, the\r\nspider draws the thread from its spinnerets as it has need. If it wishes\r\nto descend, like the one this morning that came down from the ceiling on\r\nto Mother Ambroisine’s shoulder, it glues the end of the thread to the\r\npoint of departure and lets itself fall perpendicularly. The thread is\r\ndrawn from the spinnerets by the weight of the spider, and the latter,\r\nsoftly suspended, descends to any depth it wishes, and as slowly as it\r\npleases. In order to ascend again, it climbs up the thread by folding it\r\ngradually into a skein between its legs. For a second descent, the\r\nspider has only to let its skein of silk unwind little by little.\r\n\r\n“To weave its web, each kind of spider has its own method of procedure,\r\naccording to the kind of game it is going to hunt, the places it\r\nfrequents, and according to its particular inclinations, tastes, and\r\ninstincts. I will merely tell you a few words about the epeiræ, large\r\nspiders magnificently speckled with yellow, black, and silvery white.\r\nThey are hunters of big game,—of green or blue damsel-flies that\r\nfrequent the water-courses, of butterflies, and large flies. They\r\nstretch their web vertically between two trees and even from one bank of\r\na stream to the other. Let us examine this last case.\r\n\r\n“An epeira has found a good place for hunting: the dragon-flies, or blue\r\nand green damsel-flies, come and go from one tuft of reeds to another,\r\nsometimes going up, sometimes down the stream. Along its course are\r\nbutterflies also, and horse-flies, or large flies that suck blood from\r\ncattle. The site is a good one. Now, then, to work! The epeira climbs to\r\nthe top of a willow at the water’s edge. There it matures its plan, an\r\naudacious one, the execution of which seems impossible. A suspension\r\nbridge, a cable which serves as support for the future web, must be\r\nstretched from one bank to the other. And observe, children, that the\r\nspider cannot cross the stream by swimming; it would perish by drowning\r\nif it ventured into the water. It must stretch its cable, its bridge,\r\nfrom the top of its branch without changing place. Never has an engineer\r\nfound himself in such difficulties. What will the little creature do?\r\nPut your heads together, children; I am waiting for your ideas.”\r\n\r\n“Build a bridge from one side to the other, without crossing the water\r\nor moving away from its place? If the spider can do that it is cleverer\r\nthan I am.” Thus spoke Jules.\r\n\r\n“Than I, too,” chimed in his brother.\r\n\r\n“If I did not already know,” said Claire, “since you have just told us,\r\nthat the spider does accomplish it, I should say that its bridge is\r\nimpossible.”\r\n\r\nMother Ambroisine said nothing, but by the slackening of the tick-tack\r\nof her needles, every one could see that she was much interested in the\r\nspider’s bridge.\r\n\r\n“Animals often have more intelligence than we,” continued Uncle Paul;\r\n“the epeira will prove it to us. With its hind legs it draws a thread\r\nfrom its spinnerets. The thread lengthens and lengthens; it floats from\r\nthe top of the branch. The spider draws out more and more; finally, it\r\nstops. Is the thread long enough? Is it too short? That is what must be\r\nlooked after. If too long, it would be wasting the precious silky\r\nliquid; if too short, it would not fulfil the given conditions. A glance\r\nis thrown at the distance to be crossed, an exact glance, you may be\r\nsure. The thread is found too short. The spider lengthens it by drawing\r\nout a little more. Now all goes well: the thread has the wished-for\r\nlength, and the work is done. The epeira waits at the top of its branch:\r\nthe rest will be accomplished without help. From time to time it bears\r\nwith its legs on the thread to see if it resists. Ah! it resists; the\r\nbridge is fixed! The spider crosses the stream on its suspension bridge!\r\nWhat has happened, then? This: The thread floated from the top of the\r\nwillow. A breath of air blew the free end of the thread into the\r\nbranches on the opposite bank. This end got entangled there; behold the\r\nmystery. The epeira has only to draw the thread to itself, to stretch it\r\nproperly and make a suspension bridge of it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how simple!” cried Jules. “And yet not one of us would have thought\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend, it is very simple, but at the same time very ingenious.\r\nIt is thus with all work: simplicity in the means employed is a sign of\r\nexcellence. To simplify is to have knowledge; to complicate is to be\r\nignorant. The epeira, in its kind of construction, is science\r\nperfected.”\r\n\r\n“Where does it get that science, Uncle?” asked Claire. “Animals have not\r\nreason. Then who teaches the epeira to build its suspension bridges?”\r\n\r\n“No one, my dear child; it is born with this knowledge. It has it by\r\ninstinct, the infallible inspiration of the Father of all things, who\r\ncreates in the least of His creatures, for their preservation, ways of\r\nacting before which our reason is often confounded. When the epeira,\r\nfrom the top of the willow, gets ready to spin its web, what inspires it\r\nwith the audacious project of the bridge; what gives it patience to wait\r\nfor the floating end of the thread to entwine in the branches of the\r\nother bank; what assures it of the success of a labor that it is\r\nperforming perhaps for the first time, and has never seen done! It is\r\nthe universal Reason that watches over creation, and takes among men the\r\nthrice-holy name of Providence.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul had won his case: in the eyes of all, even of Mother\r\nAmbroisine, spiders were no longer frightful creatures.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                            THE SPIDER’S WEB\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next day the little chickens were all hatched and doing well. The\r\nhen had led them to the courtyard, and, scratching the soil and\r\nclucking, she dug up small seeds which the little ones came and took\r\nfrom their mother’s beak. At the slightest approach of danger, the hen\r\ncalled the brood, and all ran to snuggle under her outspread wings. The\r\nboldest soon put their heads out, their pretty little yellow heads\r\nframed in their mother’s black feathers. The alarm over, the hen began\r\nclucking and scratching again, and the little ones went trotting around\r\nher once more. Completely reassured, Mother Ambroisine forever renounced\r\nher proverb of the spider. In the evening Uncle Paul continued the story\r\nof the epeira.\r\n\r\n“Since it must serve as a support to the silken network, the first\r\nthread stretched from one bank to the other must be of exceptional\r\nfirmness. The epeira begins, therefore, by fixing both ends well; then,\r\ngoing and coming on the thread from one extremity to the other, always\r\nspinning, it doubles and trebles the strands and sticks them together in\r\na common cable. A second similar cable is necessary, placed beneath the\r\nfirst in an almost parallel direction. It is between the two that the\r\nweb must be spun.\r\n\r\n“For this purpose, from one of the ends of the cable already constructed\r\nthe epeira lets itself fall perpendicularly, hanging by the thread that\r\nescapes from its spinnerets. It reaches a lower branch, fastens the\r\nthread firmly to it, and ascends to the communicating bridge by the\r\nvertical thread it used for descending. The spider then reaches the\r\nother bank, still spinning, but without gluing this new strand of silk\r\nto the cable. Arrived at the other side, it lets itself slide on to a\r\nbranch conveniently placed, and there fastens the end of the thread that\r\nit has spun on its way from one bank to the other. This second chief\r\npiece of the framework becomes a cable by the addition of new threads.\r\nFinally the two parallel cables are made firm at each end by divers\r\nthreads starting from it in every direction and attaching themselves to\r\nthe branches. Other threads go out from this point and that, from one\r\ncable to the other, leaving between them, in the middle of the\r\nconstruction, a large open space, almost circular, destined for the net.\r\n\r\n“Thus far the epeira has only constructed the framework of its building,\r\na rough but solid framework; now begins the work of fine precision. The\r\nnet must he spun. Across the open circular space that the divers threads\r\nof the framework leave between them, a first thread is stretched. The\r\nepeira stations itself right in the middle of this thread, central point\r\nof the web to be constructed. From this center numerous threads must\r\nstart at equal distances from one another and be fastened to the\r\ncircumference by the other end. They are called radiating lines.\r\nAccordingly the epeira glues a thread to the center and, ascending by\r\nthe transverse thread already stretched, fixes the end of the line to\r\nthe circumference. That done, it returns to the center by the line that\r\nit has just stretched; there it glues a second thread and immediately\r\nregains the circumference, where it fastens the end of the second line a\r\nshort distance from the first one. Going thus alternately from the\r\ncenter to the circumference and from the circumference to the center by\r\nway of the last thread just stretched, the spider fills the circular\r\nspace with radiating lines so regularly spaced that you would say they\r\nwere traced with rule and compass by an expert hand.\r\n\r\n“When the radiating lines are finished, the most delicate work of all is\r\nstill left for the spider. Each of these lines must be bound by a thread\r\nthat, starting at the circumference, twists and turns in a spiral line\r\naround the center, where it terminates. The epeira starts from the top\r\nof the web and, unwinding its thread, stretches it from one radiating\r\nline to another, keeping always at an equal distance from the outside\r\nthread. By thus circling about, always at the same distance from the\r\npreceding thread, the spider ends at the center of the radiating lines.\r\nThe network is then finished.\r\n\r\n“Now there must be arranged a little ambuscade from which the epeira can\r\nsurvey its web, a resting-room where it finds shelter from the coolness\r\nof the night and the heat of the day. In a little bunch of leaves close\r\ntogether the spider builds itself a silk den, a sort of funnel of close\r\ntexture. That is its usual abiding place. If the weather is favorable\r\nand the passage of game abundant, morning and evening especially, the\r\nepeira leaves its den and posts itself, motionless, in the center of the\r\nweb, to watch events more closely and run to the game quickly enough to\r\nprevent its escape. The spider is at its post, in the middle of the\r\nnetwork, its eight legs spread out wide. It does not move, pretends to\r\nbe dead. No hunter on the watch would have such patience. Let us copy\r\nits example and await the coming of the game.”\r\n\r\nThe children were disappointed: at the moment when the story became the\r\nmost interesting, Uncle Paul broke off his narrative.\r\n\r\n“The epeira has interested me very much, Uncle,” said Jules. “The bridge\r\nover the stream, the cobweb with its regular radiating lines, and the\r\nthread that twists and turns, getting nearer and nearer to the center,\r\nthe room for ambush and rest-all that is very astonishing in a creature\r\nthat does these wonderful things without having to learn how. Catching\r\nthe game ought to be still more curious.”\r\n\r\n“Very curious indeed. Therefore, instead of telling you about the hunt,\r\nI prefer to show it to you. Yesterday, in crossing the field, I saw an\r\nepeira constructing its web between two trees on the little stream where\r\nsuch fine crayfish are caught. Let us get up early in the morning and go\r\nand see the chase.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n                               THE CHASE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Damsel-fly]\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE PAUL had said: “Let us get up early in the morning.” No one had to\r\nbe called. One sleeps little when one is going to see an epeira hunt.\r\nAbout seven o’clock, with the sun shining bright, they were at the\r\nborder of the stream. The cobweb was finished. Some dewdrops hanging to\r\nthe threads shone like pearls. Hence the spider was not yet in the\r\ncenter of the net; no doubt it was waiting, before descending from its\r\nroom, for the sun to dissipate the morning dampness. The party sat down\r\non the grass for breakfast, at the very foot of the alder-tree to which\r\nwere fastened the cables of the net. Blue damsel-flies flew from one\r\ntuft of rushes to another and chased each other playfully. Beware, you\r\ngiddy ones, who will not know how to avoid the web by passing over and\r\nunder it! Ah! it has happened; so much the worse for the victim. When\r\none plays foolishly with one’s companions, one must at least look where\r\none is going. A dragon-fly is caught in the meshes of the web. With one\r\nwing free it struggles to escape. It shakes the web, but the cables hold\r\nin spite of the shaking. Threads in communication with the resting-room\r\nwarn the epeira, by their agitation, of the important things taking\r\nplace in the net. The spider hastily descends, but it does not get there\r\nin time. With a desperate stroke of its wing the dragon-fly frees itself\r\nand escapes, tearing a large hole in the web.\r\n\r\n“Oh! how well it got out!” cried Jules. “A little more and the poor\r\nthing would have been eaten alive. Did you see, Emile, how quickly the\r\nspider ran down from its hiding place when it felt the web move? The\r\nhunt begins badly; the game escapes and the net is torn.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but the spider is going to mend it,” his uncle reassured him.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, as soon as it had recovered from its misadventure, the\r\nepeira renewed the broken threads with delicate dexterity. The darning\r\nfinished, the damage could hardly be detected. The spider now takes its\r\nplace in the center of the network: the right moment for the chase has\r\ncome, apparently, and it is advisable for it to pounce upon the game as\r\nquickly as possible, to avoid other misadventures. It spreads its eight\r\nfeet in a circle, to receive the slightest movement that may come at any\r\npoint of the web, and it waits, completely motionless.\r\n\r\nThe dragon-flies continue their evolutions. Not one is caught: the\r\nrecent alarm has rendered them circumspect; they fly around the web to\r\npass beyond it. Oh! oh! what is that coming so giddily and striking its\r\nhead against the network? It is a little bumble-bee, all velvety and\r\nblack, with a red stomach. It is caught. The epeira runs. But the\r\ncaptive is vigorous and formidable; perhaps it has a sting. The spider\r\nmistrusts it. It draws a thread from its spinneret and passes it quickly\r\nover the bee. A second silk string, a third, a fourth, soon subdue the\r\ncaptive’s desperate efforts. Here is the bee strangled but still full of\r\nlife, and menacing. To seize it in that state would be great imprudence:\r\nthe epeira’s life would be at stake. What must be done so as to leave\r\nnothing to fear from this dangerous prey? The spider possesses, folded\r\nunder its head, two sharp-pointed fangs, which let flow a little drop of\r\npoison through a hole in their extremities. That is its hunting weapon.\r\nThe epeira approaches cautiously, opens its fangs, stings the bee, and\r\nimmediately moves aside. In the twinkling of an eye it is all over. The\r\npoison acts instantly: the bee trembles, its legs stiffen, it is dead.\r\nThe spider carries it off to its silken chamber to suck it at leisure.\r\nWhen nothing but the skin is left, the spider will throw the remains of\r\nthe bee far from its domicile, so as not to soil its web with a corpse\r\nthat might frighten other game.\r\n\r\n“It was done so quickly,” complained Jules, “I did not see the spider’s\r\npoisonous fangs. If we were to wait a little longer, another bumble-bee\r\nmight perhaps come and then I should see it better.”\r\n\r\n“It is not necessary to wait,” replied Uncle Paul. “If we proceed\r\nskilfully we can make the spider recommence its hunting manœuvers. All\r\nof you look attentively.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul searched among the field flowers for a moment and caught a\r\nlarge fly; then, holding it by one wing, put it near the web. The\r\ninsect, beating about, gets entangled in the threads. The web shakes,\r\nthe spider leaves its bee and runs, delighted with the fortunate chance\r\nthat brings him prey again so quickly. The same manœuvers begin again.\r\nThe fly is first strangled; the epeira opens its pointed fangs, stings\r\nthe fly a little, and all is over. The victim trembles, stretches itself\r\nout, and ceases to move.\r\n\r\n“Ah! that time I saw it,” said Jules, satisfied at last.\r\n\r\n“Claire, did you notice the fineness of the spider’s fangs?” asked\r\nEmile. “I am sure that in your needle-case you haven’t any such\r\nfine-pointed needles.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say not. As for me, what surprises me the most is not the\r\nfineness of the spider’s fangs, but the quickness of the victim’s death.\r\nIt seems to me that a fly as large as this one ought not to die so\r\nquickly even from the coarser pricks of our needles.”\r\n\r\n“Very true,” assented her uncle. “An insect transfixed by a pin still\r\nlives a long time; but if it is only pricked by the fine point of the\r\nspider’s fangs, it dies almost instantly. But then, the spider takes\r\ncare to poison its weapon. Its fangs are venomous; they are perforated\r\nby a minute canal through which the spider lets flow at will a scarcely\r\nvisible little drop of liquid called venom, which the creature makes as\r\nit makes the silk liquid. The venom is held in reserve in a slender\r\npocket placed in the interior of the fangs. When the spider pricks its\r\nprey, it makes a little of this liquid pass into the wound, and that\r\nsuffices to bring speedy death to the wounded insect. The victim dies,\r\nnot from the prick itself, but from the dreadful ravages wrought by the\r\nvenom discharged into the wound.”\r\n\r\nHere Uncle Paul, in order to give his hearers a better view of the\r\npoisonous fangs, took the epeira with the tips of his fingers. Claire\r\nuttered a cry of fear, but her uncle soon calmed her.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be uneasy, my dear child: the poison that kills a fly will have\r\nno effect on Uncle Paul’s hard skin.”\r\n\r\nAnd with the aid of a pin he opened the creature’s fangs to show them in\r\ndetail to the children, who were quite reassured.\r\n\r\n“You must not be too frightened,” he continued, “at the quick death of\r\nthe fly and of the bumble-bee, and so look on spiders as creatures to be\r\nfeared by us. The fangs of most of them would have great difficulty in\r\npiercing our skin. Courageous observers have let themselves be bitten by\r\nthe various spiders of our country. The sting has never produced any\r\nserious results; nothing more than a redness less painful than that\r\nproduced by the sting of a mosquito. At the same time, persons with a\r\ndelicate skin ought to beware of the large kinds, were it only to spare\r\nthemselves a passing pain. Without any excessive alarm we avoid the\r\nwasp’s sting, which is very painful; let us avoid the spider’s fangs in\r\nthe same way without uttering loud cries at the sight of one of these\r\ncreatures. We will resume the subject of the venomous insects. But it is\r\nlate; let us go.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n                            VENOMOUS INSECTS\r\n\r\n\r\n“YOU have heard that certain creatures emit poison, that is to say,\r\nshoot from a distance into the face and on to the hands of those who\r\napproach a liquid capable of causing death, or at least of blinding or\r\notherwise injuring them. Last week Jules found on the leaves of the\r\npotato-vines a large caterpillar armed with a curved horn.”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know,” put in Jules. “It is the caterpillar, you told me,\r\nthat turns into a magnificent butterfly called the sphinx Atropos. This\r\nbutterfly, large as my hand, has on its back a white spot that frightens\r\nmany people, for it has a vague resemblance to a death’s-head. And\r\nbesides, its eyes shine in the dark. You added that it was a harmless\r\ncreature of which it would be unreasonable to be afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Jacques, who was weeding the potatoes,” continued Uncle Paul, “knocked\r\nthe sphinx caterpillar out of Jules’s hands, and hastened to crush it\r\nwith his big wooden shoe. ‘What you are doing is very dangerous,’ said\r\nthe good Jacques. ‘Handling poisonous creatures—of all things! Do you\r\nsee that green venom? Don’t get too close; the silly thing is not quite\r\ndead; it might yet throw some poison on you.’ The worthy man took the\r\ngreen entrails of the crushed caterpillar for poison. Those entrails did\r\nnot contain anything dangerous; they were green because they were\r\nswollen with the juice of the leaves that the poor thing had just eaten.\r\n\r\n“Many persons are of the same opinion as Jacques: they are afraid of a\r\ncaterpillar and the green of its entrails. They think that certain\r\ncreatures poison everything they touch and throw out venom. Well, my\r\ndear children, you must bear this in mind, for it is a very important\r\nthing and frees us from foolish fears, while it puts us on guard against\r\nreal danger: no animal of any kind, absolutely none, shoots venom and\r\ncan harm us from a distance. To be convinced of this it suffices to know\r\nwhat venom really is. Divers creatures, large or small, are endowed with\r\na poisoned weapon that serves them either as defense or to attack their\r\nprey. The bee is our best known venomous creature.”\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed Emile, “a bee is poisonous, the bee that makes honey\r\nfor us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the bee; the bee without which we could not have those honey cakes\r\nthat Mother Ambroisine hands round when you are good. You don’t think\r\nthen of the stings that made you cry so?”\r\n\r\nEmile blushed: his uncle had just revived unpleasant memories. From pure\r\nheedlessness he tried one day to see what the bees were doing. They say\r\nhe even thrust a stick through the little door of the hive. The bees\r\nbecame incensed at this indiscretion. Three or four stung the poor boy\r\non the cheeks and hands. He cried out most piteously, and thought\r\nhimself done for. His uncle had much difficulty in consoling him.\r\nCompresses of cold water finally soothed his smarting pains.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Solitary wasp and nest]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The bee is venomous,” repeated Uncle Paul; “Emile could tell you that.”\r\n\r\n“The wasp too, then?” asked Jules. “One stung me once when I tried to\r\ndrive it from a bunch of grapes. I did not say anything, but all the\r\nsame I was not very comfortable. To think that such a tiny thing can\r\nhurt one so! It seemed as if my hands were on fire.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, the wasp is venomous; more so than the bee, in the sense\r\nthat its sting causes greater pain. Bumble-bees are, too, as well as\r\nhornets, those large reddish wasps, an inch long, which sometimes come\r\nand gnaw the pears in the orchard. You must beware especially of\r\nhornets, my little friends. One sting from them, one only, would give\r\nyou hours of horrible pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: American Hornet]\r\n\r\n\r\n“All these insects have, for their defense, a poisoned weapon\r\nconstructed in the same way. It is called the sting. It is a small,\r\nhard, and very pointed blade, a kind of dagger finer than the finest\r\nneedle. The sting is placed at the end of the creature’s stomach. When\r\nin repose, it is not seen; it is hidden in a scabbard that goes into its\r\nstomach. To defend itself, the insect draws it out of its sheath and\r\nplunges the point into the imprudent finger found within reach.\r\n\r\n“Now it is not exactly the wound made by the sting that causes the\r\nsmarting pain that you are familiar with. This wound is so slight, so\r\nminute, we cannot see it. We should hardly feel it were it made with a\r\nneedle or a thorn as fine as the sting. But the sting communicates with\r\na pocket of venom lodged in the creature’s body, and, by means of a\r\nhollowed-out canal, it carries to the bottom of the wound a little drop\r\nof the formidable liquid. The sting is then drawn back. As to the venom,\r\nit stays in the wound and it is that, that alone, which causes those\r\nshooting pains that Emile could, if necessary, tell us about.”\r\n\r\nAt this second attack from Uncle Paul, who dwelt on this misadventure in\r\norder to blame him for his heedless treatment of the bees, Emile blew\r\nhis nose, although he did not need to. It was a way of hiding his\r\nconfusion. His uncle did not appear to notice it, and continued:\r\n\r\n“Scholars who have made a study of this curious question tell us of the\r\nfollowing experiment, to make clear that it is really the venomous\r\nliquid introduced into the wound, and not the wound itself, that causes\r\nthe pain. When one pricks oneself with a very fine needle, the hurt is\r\nvery slight and soon passes off. I am sure Claire is not much frightened\r\nwhen she pricks her finger in sewing.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no,” said she. “That is so soon over, even if blood comes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the prick of a needle, insignificant in itself, can cause sharp\r\npains if the little wound is poisoned with the venom of the bee or wasp.\r\nThe scholars I am telling you of dip the point of the needle into the\r\nbee’s pocket of venom, and with this point thus wet with the venomous\r\nliquid give themselves a slight sting. The pain is now sharp and of long\r\nduration, more so than if the insect itself had stung the experimenter.\r\nThis increase of pain is due to the fact that the comparatively large\r\nneedle introduces into the wound more venom than could the bee’s slender\r\nsting. You understand it now, I hope: it is the introduction of the\r\nvenom into the wound that causes all the trouble.”\r\n\r\n“That is plain,” said Jules. “But tell me, Uncle, why these scholars\r\namuse themselves by pricking themselves with needles dipped in the bee’s\r\nvenom? It is a queer amusement, to hurt oneself for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“For nothing, Mr. Harum-scarum? Do you count as nothing what I have just\r\ntold you? If I know it, must not others have taught me? Who are these\r\nothers? They are the valiant investigators who learn about everything,\r\nobserve and study everything, in order to alleviate our suffering. When\r\nthey voluntarily prick themselves with poison, they propose to study in\r\nthemselves, at their own risk and peril, the action of the venom, to\r\nteach us to combat its effects, which are sometimes so formidable. Let a\r\nviper or a scorpion sting us, and our life is in peril. Ah, then it is\r\nimportant to know exactly how the venom acts and what must be done to\r\narrest its ravages; it is then that the scholars’ researches are\r\nappreciated, researches that Jules looks upon as merely a queer\r\namusement. Science, my little friend, has sacred enthusiasms that do not\r\nshrink from any test that may enlarge the sphere of our knowledge and\r\ndiminish human suffering.”\r\n\r\nJules, confused by his unfortunate remark, lowered his head and said not\r\na word. Uncle Paul was on the point of getting vexed, but peace was soon\r\nrestored and he continued the account of venomous creatures.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                                 VENOM\r\n\r\n\r\n“ALL venomous creatures act in the same way as the bee, wasp, and\r\nhornet. With a special weapon—needle, fang, sting, lancet—placed\r\nsometimes in one part of the body, sometimes in another, according to\r\nthe species, they make a slight wound into which is instilled a drop of\r\nvenom. The weapon has no other effect than that of opening a route for\r\nthe venomous liquid, and this is what causes the injury. For the poison\r\nto act on us, it must come in contact with our blood by a wound which\r\nopens the way for it. But it has positively no effect on our skin,\r\nunless there is already a gash, a simple scratch, that permits it to\r\npenetrate into the flesh and mingle with the blood. The most terrible\r\nvenom can be handled without any danger if the skin is not broken.\r\nMoreover, it can be put on the lips, on the tongue, even swallowed\r\nwithout any bad results. Placed on the lips, the hornet’s venom produces\r\nno more effect than clear water; but if there is the slightest scratch\r\nthe pain is atrocious. The viper’s venom is equally harmless as long as\r\nit does not mingle with the blood. Courageous experimenters have tasted,\r\nswallowed it, and yet afterward were no worse off than before.”\r\n\r\n“Is that true, Uncle? People have had the courage to swallow a viper’s\r\nvenom? Ah! I should not have been so brave.” This from Claire.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copper Head]\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is fortunate, my girl, that others have been so for us; and we ought\r\nto be very grateful to them, for by so doing they have taught us, as you\r\nwill see, the most prompt and one of the most efficacious means to\r\nemploy in case of accident.”\r\n\r\n“This viper’s venom, which has no effect on the hand, lips, and tongue,\r\nis it much to be feared if it mingles with the blood?”\r\n\r\n“It is terrible, my young lady, and I was just going to tell you about\r\nit. Let us suppose that some imprudent person disturbs the formidable\r\nreptile sleeping in the sun. Suddenly the creature uncoils itself in\r\ncircles one above another, unwinds with the suddenness of a spring, and,\r\nwith its jaws wide open, strikes you on the hand. It is done in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye. With the same rapidity the viper refolds its spiral\r\nand draws back, continuing to menace you with its head in the center of\r\nthe coil. You do not wait for a second attack, you flee; but, alas! the\r\ndamage is done. On the wounded hand are seen two little red points,\r\nalmost insignificant, mere needle pricks. It is not very alarming; you\r\nreassure yourself if you are in ignorance of what I so earnestly desire\r\nto teach you. Delusive innocuousness! See the red spots becoming\r\nencircled with a livid ring. With dull pains the hand swells, and the\r\nswelling extends gradually to the arm. Soon come cold sweats and nausea;\r\nrespiration becomes painful, sight troubled, mind torpid, a general\r\nyellowness shows itself, accompanied by convulsions. If help does not\r\narrive in time, death may come.”\r\n\r\n“You give us goose-flesh, Uncle,” said Jules, with a shudder. “What\r\nshould we poor things do if such a misfortune happened to us away from\r\nyou, away from home? They say there are vipers in the underbrush of the\r\nneighboring hills.”\r\n\r\n“May God guard you from such a mischance, my poor children! But, if it\r\nbefalls you, you must bind tight the finger, hand, arm, above the\r\nwounded part to prevent the diffusion of the venom in the blood; you\r\nmust make the wound bleed by pressing round it; you must suck it hard to\r\nextract the venomous liquid. I told you venom has no effect on the skin.\r\nTo suck it, therefore, is harmless if the mouth has no scratch. You can\r\nsee that if, by hard suction and by pressure that makes the blood flow,\r\nyou succeed in extracting all the venom from the wound, the wound itself\r\nis thenceforth of no importance. For greater surety, the wound should be\r\ncauterized as soon as possible with a corrosive liquid, aqua fortis or\r\nammonia, or even with a red-hot iron. The effect of the cauterization is\r\nto destroy the venomous matter. It is painful, I acknowledge, but one\r\nmust submit to it in order to avoid a worse evil. Cauterization is the\r\ndoctor’s business. The initial precautions, binding to prevent the\r\ndiffusion of the venom, pressure to make the poisoned blood flow, hard\r\nsuction to extract the venomous liquid, concern us personally, and all\r\nthat must be done instantly. The longer it is put off, the more\r\naggravated the evil. When these precautions are taken soon enough, it is\r\nseldom that the viper’s bite has injurious consequences.”\r\n\r\n“You reassure me, Uncle. Those precautions are not difficult to take, if\r\none does not lose one’s presence of mind.”\r\n\r\n“Therefore it is important that we should all acquire the habit of using\r\nour reason in time of danger, and not let ourselves be overcome by\r\nill-regulated fears. Man master of himself is half-master of danger.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n                       THE VIPER AND THE SCORPION\r\n\r\n\r\n“YOU just said,” interposed Emile, “the _bite_ of the viper, and not the\r\n_sting_. Then serpents bite, and do not sting. I thought it was just the\r\nother way. I have always heard they had a sting. Last Thursday lame\r\nLouis, who is not afraid of anything, caught a serpent in a hole of the\r\nold wall. He had two comrades with him. They bound the creature round\r\nthe neck with a rush. I was passing, and they called me. The serpent was\r\ndarting from its mouth something black, pointed, flexible, which came\r\nand went rapidly. I thought it was the sting and was much afraid of it.\r\nLouis laughed. He said what I took for a sting was the serpent’s tongue;\r\nand to prove it to me, he put his hand near it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Head of Snake showing Forked Tongue]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Louis was right,” replied Uncle Paul. “All serpents dart a very\r\nflexible, forked, black filament between their lips with great\r\nswiftness. For many purposes it is the reptile’s weapon, or dart; but in\r\nreality this filament is nothing but the tongue, a quite inoffensive\r\ntongue, which the creature uses to catch insects and to express in its\r\npeculiar manner the passions that agitate it by darting it quickly from\r\nbetween the lips. All serpents, without any exception, have one; but in\r\nour countries the viper alone possesses the terrible venomous apparatus.\r\n\r\n“This apparatus is composed, first, of two hooks, or teeth, long and\r\npointed, placed in the upper jaw. At the will of the creature they stand\r\nup erect for the attack or lie down in a groove of the gum, and hold\r\nthemselves there as inoffensive as a stiletto in its sheath. In that way\r\nthe reptile runs no danger of wounding itself. These fangs are hollow\r\nand pierced toward the point by a small opening through which the venom\r\nis injected into the wound. Finally, at the base of each fang is a\r\nlittle pocket full of venomous liquid. It is an innocent-looking humor,\r\nodorless, tasteless; one would almost think it was water. When the viper\r\nstrikes with its fangs, the venomous pocket drives a drop of its\r\ncontents into the canal of the tooth, and the terrible liquid is\r\ninstilled into the wound.\r\n\r\n“By preference the viper inhabits warm and rocky hills; it keeps under\r\nstones and thickets of brush. It is brown or reddish in color. On the\r\nback it has a somber zigzag band, and on each side a row of spots. Its\r\nstomach is slate-gray. Its head is a little triangular, larger than the\r\nneck, obtuse and as if cut off in front. The viper is timid and fearful;\r\nit attacks man only in self-defense. Its movements are brusk, irregular,\r\nand sluggish.\r\n\r\n“The other serpents of our countries, serpents designated by the general\r\nname of snakes, have not the venomous fangs of the viper. Their bite\r\ntherefore is not of importance, and the repugnance they inspire in us is\r\nreally groundless.\r\n\r\n“Next to the viper there is in France no venomous creature more to be\r\nfeared than the scorpion. It is very ugly and walks on eight feet. In\r\nfront it has two pincers like those of the crayfish, and behind a\r\nknotty, curled tail ending in a sting. The pincers are inoffensive,\r\ndespite their menacing aspect; it is the sting with which the end of the\r\ntail is armed that is venomous. The scorpion makes use of it in\r\nself-defense and to kill the insects on which it feeds. In the southern\r\ndepartments of France are found two different kinds of scorpions. One,\r\nof a greenish black, frequents dark and cool places and even establishes\r\nitself in houses. It leaves its retreat only at night. It can be seen\r\nthen running on the damp and cracked walls, seeking wood-lice and\r\nspiders, its customary prey. The other, much larger, is pale yellow. It\r\nkeeps under warm and sandy stones. The black scorpion’s sting does not\r\ncause serious injury; that of the yellow may be mortal. When one of\r\nthese creatures is irritated, a little drop of liquid can be seen\r\nforming into a pearl at the extremity of the sting, which is all ready\r\nto strike. It is the drop of venom that the scorpion injects into the\r\nwound.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scorpion seen from above]\r\n\r\n\r\n“There are many other important things I could tell you about the\r\nvenomous creatures of foreign countries, about divers serpents whose\r\nbite causes a dreadful death; but I hear Mother Ambroisine calling us to\r\ndinner. Let us go over rapidly what I have just told you. No creature,\r\nhowever ugly it may be, shoots venom or can do us any harm from a\r\ndistance. All venomous species act in the same way: with a special\r\nweapon a slight wound is made; and into this wound a drop of venom is\r\nintroduced. The wound, by itself, is nothing; it is the injected liquid\r\nthat makes it painful and sometimes mortal. The venomous weapon serves\r\nthe creature for hunting and for defense. It is placed in a part of the\r\nbody that varies according to the species. Spiders have a double fang\r\nfolded at the entrance of the mouth; bees, wasps, hornets, bumble-bees,\r\nhave a sting at the end of the stomach and kept invisible in its sheath\r\nwhen in repose; the viper and all venomous serpents have two long\r\nhollowed-out teeth on the upper jaw; the scorpion carries a sting at the\r\nend of its tail.”\r\n\r\n“I am very sorry,” said Jules, “that Jacques did not hear your account\r\nof venomous creatures; he would have understood that caterpillars’ green\r\nentrails are not venom. I will tell him all these things; and if I find\r\nanother beautiful sphinx caterpillar I will not crush it.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                               THE NETTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER dinner, while their uncle read under the chestnut tree, the\r\nchildren scattered in the garden. Claire attended to her cuttings, Jules\r\nwatered his vases, and Emile——Ah, giddy-pate, what should happen to him\r\nbut another misfortune! A large butterfly was flying over the weeds that\r\ngrow at the foot of the wall. Oh, what a magnificent butterfly! On the\r\nupper side its wings are red, fringed with black, with big blue eyes;\r\nunderneath they are brown with wavy lines. It alights. Good. Emile makes\r\nhimself small, approaches softly on tip-toe, puts out his hand, and, all\r\nat once, the butterfly is gone. But mark what follows. Emile draws his\r\nhand back quickly; it smarts, is red. The pain increases and becomes so\r\nbad that the poor boy runs to his uncle, his eyes swollen with tears.\r\n\r\n“A venomous creature has stung me!” he cries. “See my hand, Uncle! It\r\nsmarts—oh, how it smarts! Some viper has bitten me!”\r\n\r\nAt this word viper, Uncle Paul started. He rose and looked at the\r\ninjured hand. A smile came to his lips.\r\n\r\n“Impossible, my little friend; there is no viper in the garden. What\r\nfoolishness have you been committing? Where have you been?”\r\n\r\n“I ran after a butterfly, and when I put out my hand to catch it on the\r\nweeds at the foot of the wall, something stung me. See!”\r\n\r\n“It is nothing, my poor Emile; go and dip your hand into the cool water\r\nof the fountain, and the pain will go away.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nettle]\r\n\r\n\r\nQuarter of an hour later they were talking of Emile’s accident, he being\r\nquite recovered from his misadventure.\r\n\r\n“Now that the pain is gone, does not Emile want to know what stung him?”\r\nasked his uncle.\r\n\r\n“I certainly ought to know, so as not to be caught another time.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is a plant called nettle. Its leaves, stems, slightest\r\nbranches are covered with a multitude of bristles, stiff, hollow, and\r\nfilled with a venomous liquid. When one of these bristles penetrates the\r\nskin, the point breaks, the little vial of venom opens and spills its\r\ncontents into the wound. From that comes a smarting but not dangerous\r\npain. You see, the nettle’s bristles act like the weapons of venomous\r\ncreatures. It is always a hollow point that makes a fine wound in the\r\nskin, and passes a drop of liquid into it, the cause of all the ill. The\r\nnettle is thus a venomous plant.\r\n\r\n“I will also tell Emile that the beautiful butterfly for which he\r\nthoughtlessly thrust his hand into the tuft of nettles is called the\r\nVanessa Io. Its caterpillar is velvety black with white spots. It also\r\nbristles with thorns. It does not make a cocoon. Its chrysalis,\r\nornamented with bands that shine like gold, is suspended in the air by\r\nthe end of its tail. The caterpillar lives on the nettle, of which it\r\neats the leaves, notwithstanding their venomous bristles.”\r\n\r\n“In browsing on the venomous plant, how does the caterpillar manage so\r\nas not to poison itself?” Claire inquired.\r\n\r\n“My dear child, you confound _venomous_ with _poisonous_. _Venomous_ is\r\nsaid of a substance that, introduced into the blood by any kind of a\r\nwound, causes injury in the manner of the viper’s venom. _Poisonous_ is\r\nsaid of a substance that, swallowed or introduced into the stomach, may\r\ncause death. Fatal drugs are poisonous: they kill if eaten or drunk. The\r\nliquid that flows from the viper’s fangs and the scorpion’s sting is\r\nvenomous: it kills when it mixes with the blood; but it is not\r\npoisonous, for it can be swallowed with impunity. It is the same with\r\nthe nettle’s venom. So Mother Ambroisine gives the poultry chopped\r\nnettles, and the caterpillar of the Vanessa feeds without danger on the\r\nplant which, a little while ago, made Emile cry with pain. Of venomous\r\nplants we have in our country only nettles; but we have many poisonous\r\nplants that, when eaten, cause illness and even death. I must certainly\r\ntell you about them some day, so as to teach you to avoid them.\r\n\r\n“The nettle’s bristles remind me of the caterpillar’s hairs. Many\r\ncaterpillars have the skin quite bare. They are then perfectly\r\ninoffensive. They can be handled without any danger, however large they\r\nmay be, even those that have a horn at the end of the back. They are no\r\nmore to be feared than the silkworm. Others have bodies all bristly with\r\nhairs, sometimes very sharp and barbed, which can lodge in the skin,\r\nleave their points there, and thus produce lively itchings or even\r\npainful swellings. It is well then to mistrust velvety caterpillars,\r\nparticularly those living in companies on oaks and pines, in large silk\r\nnests, and called processionary caterpillars. But here we have a word\r\nthat calls for another story.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n                       PROCESSIONARY CATERPILLARS\r\n\r\n\r\n“WE frequently see, at the ends of pine branches, voluminous bags of\r\nwhite silk intermixed with leaves. These bags are, generally, puffed out\r\nat the top and narrow at the bottom, pear-shaped. They are sometimes as\r\nlarge as a person’s head. They are nests where live together a kind of\r\nvery velvety caterpillars with red hairs. A family of caterpillars,\r\ncoming from the eggs laid by one butterfly, construct a silk lodging in\r\ncommon. All take part in the work, all spin and weave in the general\r\ninterest. The interior of the nest is divided by thin silk partitions\r\ninto a number of compartments. At the large end, sometimes elsewhere, is\r\nseen a wide funnel-shaped opening; it is the large door for entering and\r\ndeparting. Other doors, smaller, are distributed here and there. The\r\ncaterpillars pass the winter in their nest, well sheltered from bad\r\nweather. In summer they take refuge there at night and during the great\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n“As soon as it is day, they set out to spread themselves on the pine and\r\neat the leaves. After eating their fill they reënter their silk\r\ndwelling, sheltered from the heat of the sun. Now, when they are out on\r\na campaign, be it on the tree that bears the nest, or on the ground\r\npassing from one pine to another, these caterpillars march in a singular\r\nfashion, which has given them the name of processionaries, because, in\r\nfact, they defile in a procession, one after the other, and in the\r\nfinest order.\r\n\r\n“One, the first come—for amongst them there is perfect equality—starts\r\non the way and serves as head of the expedition. A second follows,\r\nwithout a space between; a third follows the second in the same way; and\r\nalways thus, as many as there are caterpillars in the nest. The\r\nprocession, numbering several hundreds, is now on the march. It defiles\r\nin one line, sometimes straight, sometimes winding, but always\r\ncontinuous, for each caterpillar that follows touches with its head the\r\nrear end of the preceding caterpillar. The procession describes on the\r\nground a long and pleasing garland, which undulates to the right and\r\nleft with unceasing variation. When several nests are near together and\r\ntheir processions happen to meet, the spectacle attains its highest\r\ninterest. Then the different living garlands cross each other, get\r\nentangled and disentangled, knotted up and unknotted, forming the most\r\ncapricious figures. The encounter does not lead to confusion. All the\r\ncaterpillars of the same file march with a uniform and almost grave\r\nstep; not one hastens to get before the others, not one remains behind,\r\nnot one makes a mistake in the procession. Each one keeps its rank and\r\nscrupulously regulates its march by the one that precedes it. The\r\nfile-leader of the troop directs the evolutions. When it turns to the\r\nright, all the caterpillars of the same line, one after the other, turn\r\nto the right; when it turns to the left, all, one after the other, turn\r\nto the left. If it stops, the whole procession stops, but not\r\nsimultaneously; the second caterpillar first, then the third, fourth,\r\nfifth, and so on until the last. They would be called well-trained\r\ntroops that, when defiling in order, stop at the word of command and\r\nclose their ranks.\r\n\r\n“The expedition, simply a promenade, or a journey in search of\r\nprovisions, is now finished. They have gone far away from their nest. It\r\nis time to go home. How can they find it, through the grass and\r\nunderbrush, and over all the obstacles of the road they have just\r\ntraveled? Will they let themselves be guided by sight, obstructed though\r\nit be by every little tuft of grass; by the sense of smell, which wafted\r\nodors of every sort may put at fault? No, no; processionary caterpillars\r\nhave for their guidance in traveling something better than sight or\r\nsmell. They have instinct, which inspires them with infallible\r\nresources. Without taking account of what they do, they call to their\r\nservice means that seem dictated by reason. Without doubt, they do not\r\nreason, but they obey the secret impulse of the eternal Reason, in whom\r\nand through whom all live.\r\n\r\n“Now, this is what the processionary caterpillars do in order not to\r\nlose their way home again after a distant expedition. We pave our roads\r\nwith crushed stone; caterpillars are more luxurious in their highways:\r\nthey spread on their road a carpet of silk, they walk on nothing but\r\nsilk. They spin continually on the journey and glue their silk all along\r\nthe road. In fact, each caterpillar of the procession can be seen\r\nlowering and raising its head alternately. In the first movement, the\r\nspinneret, situated in the lower lip, glues the thread to the road that\r\nthe procession is following; in the second, the spinneret lets the\r\nthread run out while the caterpillar is taking several steps. Then the\r\nhead is lowered and lifted again, and a second length of thread is put\r\nin place. Each caterpillar that follows walks on the threads left by the\r\npreceding ones and adds its own thread to the silk, so that in all its\r\nlength the road passed over is carpeted with a silky ribbon. It is by\r\nfollowing this ribbon conductor that the processionaries get back to\r\ntheir home without ever losing their way, however tortuous the road may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n“If one wishes to embarrass the procession, it suffices to pass the\r\nfinger over the track so as to cut the silk road. The procession stops\r\nbefore the cut with every indication of fear and mistrust. Shall they go\r\non! Shall they not go on! The heads rise and fall in anxious quest of\r\nthe conductor threads. At last, one caterpillar bolder than the others,\r\nor perhaps more impatient, crosses the bad place and stretches its\r\nthread from one end of the cut to the other. A second, without\r\nhesitating, passes over on the thread left by the first, and in passing\r\nadds its own thread to the bridge. The others in turn all do the same.\r\nSoon the broken road is repaired and the defile of the procession\r\ncontinues.\r\n\r\n“The processionary caterpillar of the oak marches in another way. It is\r\ncovered with white hairs turned back and very long. One nest contains\r\nfrom seven to eight hundred individuals. When an expedition is decided\r\non, a caterpillar leaves the nest and pauses at a certain distance to\r\ngive the others time to arrange themselves in rank and file and form a\r\nbattalion. This first caterpillar has to start the march. Following it,\r\nothers place themselves, not one after another, like the processionaries\r\nof the pine, but in rows of two, three, four, and more. The troop,\r\ncompleted, begins to move in obedience to the evolutions of its\r\nfile-leader, which always marches alone at the head of the legion, while\r\nthe other caterpillars advance several abreast, dressing their ranks in\r\nperfect order. The first ranks of the army corps are always arranged in\r\nwedge formation, because of the gradual increase in the number of\r\ncaterpillars composing it; the remainder are more or less expanded in\r\ndifferent places. There are sometimes rows of from fifteen to twenty\r\ncaterpillars marching in step, like well-trained soldiers, so that the\r\nhead of one is never beyond the head of another. Of course the troop\r\ncarpets its road with silk as it marches, so as to find its way back to\r\nits nest.\r\n\r\n“The processionaries, especially those of the oak, retire to their nests\r\nto slough their skins, and these nests finally become filled with a fine\r\ndust of broken hairs. When you touch these nests, the dust of the hairs\r\nsticks to your hands and face, and causes an inflammation that lasts\r\nseveral days if the skin is delicate. One has only to stand at the foot\r\nof an oak where the processionaries have established themselves, to\r\nreceive the irritating dust blown by the wind, and to feel a smart\r\nitching.”\r\n\r\n“What a pity the processionaries have those detestable hairs!” Jules\r\nexclaimed. “If they hadn’t—”\r\n\r\n“If they hadn’t, Jules would much like to see the caterpillars’\r\nprocession. Never mind; after all, the danger is not so great. And then,\r\nif one had to scratch one’s self a little, it would not be a serious\r\nmatter. Besides, we will turn our attention to the processionary of the\r\npine, less to be feared than that of the oak. At the warmest part of the\r\nday we will go and look for a caterpillars’ nest in the pine wood; but\r\nJules and I will go alone. It would be too hot for Emile and Claire.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n                               THE STORM\r\n\r\n\r\nAND, in fact, it was very hot when Uncle Paul and Jules started out.\r\nWith a burning sun, they were sure to find the caterpillars in their\r\nsilk bag, where they do not fail to take refuge to shelter themselves\r\nfrom a light that is too glaring for them; at an earlier or later hour,\r\nthe nests might be empty, and the journey a fruitless one.\r\n\r\nHis heart full of the naïve joys proper to his age, his mind preoccupied\r\nby the caterpillars and their processions, Jules walked at a good pace,\r\nforgetting heat and fatigue. He had untied his cravat and thrown his\r\nblouse back on his shoulders. A holly stick, cut by his uncle from the\r\nhedge, served him as a third leg.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the crickets chirped louder than usual; frogs croaked in\r\nthe ponds; flies became teasing and persistent; sometimes a breath of\r\nair all at once blew along the road and raised a whirling column of\r\ndust. Jules did not notice these signs, but his uncle did, and from time\r\nto time looked up at the sky. Masses of reddish mist in the south seemed\r\nto give him some concern. “Perhaps we shall have rain,” said he; “we\r\nmust hurry.”\r\n\r\nAbout three o’clock they were at the pine wood. Uncle Paul cut a branch\r\nbearing a magnificent nest. He had guessed right: all the caterpillars\r\nhad returned to their lodging, perhaps in prevision of bad weather. Then\r\nthey sat in the shade of a group of pines, to rest a little before\r\nreturning. Naturally they talked about caterpillars.\r\n\r\n“The processionaries, you told me,” said Jules, “leave their nests to\r\nscatter over the pines and eat the leaves. There are, in fact, a great\r\nmany branches almost reduced to sticks of dry wood. Look at that pine I\r\nam pointing at; it is half stripped of leaves, as if fire had passed\r\nover it. I like the way the processionaries travel, but I can’t help\r\npitying those fine trees that wither under the miserable caterpillar’s\r\nteeth.”\r\n\r\n“If the owner of these pines understood his interests better,” returned\r\nUncle Paul, “he would, in the winter, when the caterpillars are\r\nassembled in their silk bags, have the nests collected and burn them, in\r\norder to destroy the detestable breed that will gnaw the young shoots,\r\nbrowse the buds, and arrest the tree’s development. The harm is much\r\ngreater in our orchards. Various caterpillars live in companies on our\r\nfruit trees and spin nests in the same way as the processionaries. When\r\nsummer comes, the starveling vermin scatter all over the trees,\r\ndestroying leaves, buds, shoots. In a few hours the orchard is shorn and\r\nthe crop is destroyed in its budding. So it is necessary to keep a\r\ncareful lookout for caterpillar nests, remove them from the tree before\r\nspring, and burn them, so that nothing can escape; the future of the\r\ncrop depends on it. It is fortunate that several kinds of creatures,\r\nlittle birds especially, come to our aid in this war to the death\r\nbetween man and the caterpillar; otherwise the worm, stronger than man\r\non account of its infinite number, would ravage our crops. But we will\r\ntalk of the little birds another time; the weather is threatening, we\r\nmust go.”\r\n\r\nSee how the reddish mist in the south, thicker and darker every moment,\r\nhas become a large black cloud visibly invading the still clear part of\r\nthe sky. Wind precedes it, bending the tops of the pines like a field of\r\ngrain. There rises from the soil that odor of dust which the dry earth\r\ngives forth at the beginning of a storm.\r\n\r\n“We must not think of starting now,” cautioned Uncle Paul. “The storm is\r\ncoming; it will be upon us in a few minutes. Let us hurry and find\r\nshelter.”\r\n\r\nRain forms in the distance like a dim curtain extending clear across the\r\nsky. The sheet of water advances rapidly; it would beat the fastest\r\nracing horse. It is coming, it has come. Violent flashes of lightning\r\nfurrow it, thunder roars in its depths.\r\n\r\nAt a clap of thunder heavier than the others Jules starts. “Let us stay\r\nhere, Uncle,” says the frightened child; “let us stay under this big\r\nbushy pine. It doesn’t rain here under cover.”\r\n\r\n“No, my child,” replies his uncle, who perceives that they are in the\r\nvery heart of the storm; “let us get away from this dangerous tree.”\r\n\r\nAnd, taking Jules by the hand, he leads him hastily through the hail and\r\nrain. Beyond the wood Uncle Paul knows of an excavation hollowed out in\r\nthe rock. They arrive there just as the storm breaks with all its force.\r\n\r\nThey had been there a quarter of an hour, silent before the solemn\r\nspectacle of the tempest, when a flash of fire, of dazzling brightness,\r\nrent the dark cloud in a zigzag line and struck a pine with a frightful\r\ndetonation that had no reverberation or echo, but was so violent that\r\none would have said the sky was falling. The fearful spectacle was over\r\nin the twinkling of an eye. Wild with terror, Jules had let himself fall\r\non his knees, with clasped hands. He was crying and praying. His uncle’s\r\nserenity was undisturbed.\r\n\r\n“Take courage, my poor child,” said Uncle Paul as soon as the first\r\nfright had passed. “Let us embrace each other and thank God for having\r\nkept us safe. We have just escaped a great danger; the thunderbolt\r\nstruck the pine under which we were going to take shelter.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a scare I had, Uncle!” cried the boy. “I thought I should die\r\nof it. When you insisted on hurrying away in spite of the rain, did you\r\nknow that the bolt would strike that tree?”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear, I knew nothing about it, nor could any one know; only\r\ncertain reasons made me fear the neighborhood of the big branching pine,\r\nand prudence dictated the search for a less dangerous shelter. If I\r\nyielded to my fears, if I listened to the voice of prudence, let us give\r\nthanks to God, who gave me presence of mind at that moment.”\r\n\r\n“You will tell me what made you avoid the dangerous shelter of the tree,\r\nwill you not?”\r\n\r\n“Very willingly; but when we are all together, so that each one may\r\nprofit by it. No one ought to ignore the danger one runs in taking\r\nshelter under a tree during a storm.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the rain-cloud with its lightnings and thunders had\r\nmoved on into the distance. On one side, the sun was setting radiant; on\r\nthe opposite side, in the wake of the storm, the rainbow bent its\r\nimmense bright arch of all colors. Uncle Paul and Jules started on their\r\nway, without forgetting the famous caterpillars’ nest which might have\r\ncost them so dear.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n                              ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nJULES gave a lengthy account of the day to his brother and sister. At\r\nthe part relating to the thunderbolt Claire trembled like a leaf. “I\r\nshould have died of fright,” said she, “if I had seen the lightning\r\nstrike the pine.” After the deeper emotion came curiosity, and they all\r\nagreed to beg their uncle for a talk on the subject of thunder. And so\r\nthe next day Jules, Emile, and Claire gathered around their Uncle Paul\r\nto hear him tell them all about it. Jules broached the subject.\r\n\r\n“Now that I am no longer afraid, will you please tell us, Uncle, why we\r\nshould not take refuge under trees during a storm? Emile, I am sure,\r\nwould like to know.”\r\n\r\n“I should first of all like to know what thunder is,” said Emile.\r\n\r\n“I too,” said Claire. “When we know a little what thunder is, it will be\r\nmuch easier to understand the danger from trees.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right,” commented their uncle, approvingly. “First let us see\r\nwhether any one of you knows anything about thunder.”\r\n\r\n“When I was very small,” Emile volunteered, “I used to think it was\r\nproduced by rolling a large ball of iron made of resounding metal over\r\nthe vault of the sky. If the vault broke anywhere, the ball was dashed\r\nto the ground and the thunder fell. But I don’t believe that now. I am\r\ntoo big.”\r\n\r\n“Too big—a little fellow not so high as the first button on my vest! Say\r\nrather that your little reasoning powers are awakening and that the\r\nsimple explanation of the iron ball no longer satisfies them.”\r\n\r\nThen Claire spoke. “I am not satisfied either with the explanations I\r\nused to give myself a while ago. With me, thunder was a wagon heavily\r\nloaded with old iron. It rolled on top of a sonorous vault. Sometimes a\r\nspark would flash out from under the wheels, the same as from a horse’s\r\nhoof when it strikes a stone: that was the lightning. The vault was\r\nslippery and bordered with precipices. If the wagon happened to tip\r\nover, the load of old iron would fall to the ground, crushing people,\r\ntrees, and houses. I laughed yesterday at my explanation, but I am no\r\nfarther advanced now: I still know nothing at all about thunder.”\r\n\r\n“Your two thunders, varying to suit your infant imaginations, are based\r\non the same idea, the idea of a sonorous vault. Well, know once for all\r\nthat the blue vault of the sky is only an appearance due to the air\r\nwhich envelops us, and which, owing to the thickness of the envelope,\r\nhas a beautiful blue color. Around us there is no vault, only a thick\r\nlayer of air; and beyond that there is nothing for a vast distance until\r\nyou come to the region of the stars.”\r\n\r\n“We will give up the blue vault,” said Jules. “Emile, Claire, and I are\r\npersuaded there isn’t any. Please go on.”\r\n\r\n“Go on? Here is where difficulty begins. Do you know, my children, that\r\nyour questions are sometimes very embarrassing? ‘Go on’ is soon said;\r\nand, filled with unbounded faith in your Uncle Paul’s knowledge, you\r\nexpect an answer which, you feel sure, will satisfy your curiosity. You\r\nmust, however, understand that there are innumerable things beyond your\r\nintelligence, and before you can grasp them you must attain to riper\r\nreason. With age and study many things will become clear that now are\r\ndark to you. In this number is the cause of thunder. I am very willing\r\nto tell you something about it; but if you do not understand all that I\r\nsay you must blame your own premature curiosity. It is a difficult\r\nsubject for you, very difficult.”\r\n\r\n“Only tell us about it,” Jules persisted; “we will listen attentively.”\r\n\r\n“So be it. Air is not visible, one cannot take hold of it; if it were\r\nalways at rest you would not, perhaps, suspect its existence. But when a\r\nviolent wind bends tall poplars and scatters the leaves in eddies, when\r\nit uproots trees and carries off the roofs of buildings, who can doubt\r\nthe existence of air? For wind is only air streaming irresistibly from\r\nplace to place. Air, so subtle, so invisible, so peaceful in repose, is\r\ntherefore in very truth a material substance, even a very brutal one\r\nwhen in violent motion. That is to say, a substance can exist, although\r\nat times nothing betrays its presence. We do not see it or touch it, are\r\nnot sensible of it, and yet it is there, all about us; we are surrounded\r\nby it, live in the midst of it.\r\n\r\n“Well, there is something still more hidden than air, more invisible,\r\nmore difficult to detect. It is everywhere, absolutely everywhere, even\r\nin us; but it keeps itself so quiet that until now you have never heard\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\nEmile, Claire, and Jules exchanged glances full of meaning, trying to\r\nguess what it could be that was found ever where and that they did not\r\nyet know of. They were a hundred leagues from guessing what their uncle\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n“You might seek in vain by yourselves all day, all the year, perhaps all\r\nyour life; you would not find it. The thing I am speaking of, you\r\nunderstand, is singularly well hidden; scholars had to make very\r\ndelicate researches to learn anything about it. Let us make use of the\r\nmeans they have taught us to bring it to light.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul took from his desk a stick of sealing-wax and rubbed it\r\nrapidly over his cloth sleeve; then he put it near a small piece of\r\npaper. The children were all eyes. Behold, the paper flies up and sticks\r\nto the sealing-wax. The experiment is repeated several times. Each time\r\nthe paper rises unaided, starts off, and fastens on to the stick.\r\n\r\n“The piece of sealing-wax, which formerly did not attract the paper, now\r\ndoes. The rubbing on the cloth has, then, developed in it something that\r\ncannot be seen, for the stick has not changed in appearance; and this\r\ninvisible thing is nevertheless very real, since it can lift up the\r\npaper, draw it to the wax, and hold it glued there. This thing is called\r\nelectricity. You can easily produce it by rubbing on cloth either a\r\npiece of glass or a stick of sulphur, resin, or sealing-wax. All these\r\nsubstances, when rubbed, will acquire the property of drawing to\r\nthemselves very light objects, like small pieces of straw, little bits\r\nof paper, or particles of dust. This evening the cat shall teach us more\r\nabout it, if it will be good.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n                      THE EXPERIMENT WITH THE CAT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE wind blew cold and dry. The storm of the day before had brought it\r\non. Uncle Paul took this pretext to have the kitchen stove lighted in\r\nspite of Mother Ambroisine’s remarks, who cried out at the\r\nunseasonableness of making a fire.\r\n\r\n“Light up the stove in summer!” said she; “did one ever see the like? No\r\none but our master would have such a notion. We shall be roasted.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul let her talk; he had his own idea. They sat down at the\r\ntable. After eating its supper the big cat, never too warm, settled\r\nitself on a chair by the side of the stove, and soon, with its back\r\nturned to the warm sheet-iron, began to purr with happiness. All was\r\ngoing as desired; Uncle Paul’s projects were taking an excellent turn.\r\nThere was some complaint of the heat, but he took no notice.\r\n\r\n“Ah! do you think it is for you the stove is lighted?” said he to the\r\nchildren. “Undeceive yourselves, my little friends: it is for the cat,\r\nthe cat alone. It is so chilly, poor thing; see how happy it is on its\r\nchair.”\r\n\r\nEmile was on the point of laughing at his uncle’s kindly attentions to\r\nthe tom-cat, but Claire, who suspected serious designs, nudged him with\r\nher elbow. Claire’s suspicions were well founded. When they had finished\r\nsupper they resumed the subject of thunder. Uncle Paul began:\r\n\r\n“This morning I promised to show you, with the cat’s help, some very\r\ncurious things. The time has come for keeping my word, provided Puss is\r\nagreeable.”\r\n\r\nHe took the cat, whose hair was burning hot, and put it on his knees.\r\nThe children drew near.\r\n\r\n“Jules, put out the lamp; we must be in the dark.”\r\n\r\nThe lamp put out, Uncle Paul passed and repassed his hand over the\r\ntom-cat’s back. Oh! oh! wonderful! the beast’s hair is streaming with\r\nbright beads; little flashes of white light appear, crackle, and\r\ndisappear as the hand rubs; you would have said that sparks of fireworks\r\nwere bursting out from the fur. All looked on in wonder at the tom-cat’s\r\nsplendor.\r\n\r\n“That puts the finishing touch! Here is our cat making fire!” cried\r\nMother Ambroisine.\r\n\r\n“Does that fire burn, Uncle?” asked Jules. “The cat does not cry out,\r\nand you stroke him without being afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Those sparks are not fire,” replied Uncle Paul. “You all remember the\r\nstick of sealing-wax which, after being rubbed on cloth, attracts little\r\npieces of straw and paper. I told you that electricity, aroused by\r\nfriction, is what makes the paper draw to the wax. Well, in rubbing the\r\ncat’s back with my hand I produce electricity, but in greater abundance,\r\nso much so that it becomes visible where it was at first invisible, and\r\nbursts forth in sparks.”\r\n\r\n“If it doesn’t burn, let me try,” pleaded Jules.\r\n\r\nJules passed his hand over the cat’s fur. The bright beads and their\r\ncracklings began again still stronger. Emile and Claire did the same.\r\nMother Ambroisine was afraid. The worthy woman perhaps saw some\r\nwitchcraft in the bright sparkles from her cat. The cat was then let\r\nloose. Besides, the experiment was beginning to give annoyance, and if\r\nUncle Paul had not held the animal fast perhaps it would have begun to\r\nscratch.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n                       THE EXPERIMENT WITH PAPER\r\n\r\n\r\n“SINCE the cat threatens to get cross, we will have recourse to another\r\nway of producing electricity.\r\n\r\n“You fold lengthwise a good sheet of ordinary paper; then take hold of\r\nthe double strip by each end. Next, you heat it just to the scorching\r\npoint over a stove or in front of a hot fire. The greater the heat, the\r\nmore electricity will be developed. Finally, still holding the strip by\r\nthe ends alone, you rub it quickly, as soon as it is hot, on a piece of\r\nwoolen cloth previously warmed and stretched over the knee. It can be\r\nrubbed on the trousers if they are woolen. The friction must be rapid\r\nand lengthwise of the paper. After a short rubbing the band is quickly\r\nraised with one hand, with great care not to let the paper touch against\r\nanything; if it did the electricity would be dissipated. Then without\r\ndelay you bring up the knuckles of your free hand, or, better, the end\r\nof a key, near to the middle of the strip of paper; and you will see a\r\nbright spark dart from the paper to the key with a slight crackling. To\r\nget another spark you must go through the same operations again, for at\r\nthe approach of the finger or key the sheet of paper loses all its\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n“Instead of making a spark, you can hold the electrified sheet flat\r\nabove little pieces of paper, straw, or feathers. These light bodies are\r\nattracted and repelled in turn; they come and go rapidly from the\r\nelectrified strip to the object which serves them as support, and from\r\nthis to the strip.”\r\n\r\nAdding example to precept, Uncle Paul took a sheet of paper, folded it\r\nin a strip to give it more resistance, warmed it, rubbed it on his knee,\r\nand finally made a spark fly from it on the approach of his\r\nfinger-joint. The children were full of wonder at the lightning that\r\nsprang from the paper with a crackle. The cat’s beads were more\r\nnumerous, but less strong and brilliant.\r\n\r\nThey say that Mother Ambroisine had much trouble that evening in getting\r\nJules to go to bed; for, once master of the process, he did not tire of\r\nwarming and rubbing. His uncle’s intervention was necessary to put an\r\nend to the electric experiments.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n                         FRANKLIN AND DE ROMAS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next day Claire and her two brothers could talk of nothing but the\r\nexperiments of the evening before. It was their subject of conversation\r\nthe whole morning. The cat’s beads of fire and the flashes from the\r\npaper had greatly impressed them; so their uncle, in order to profit by\r\nthis awakening of their attention, resumed as soon as possible his\r\ninstructive talk.\r\n\r\n“I am sure you are all three asking yourselves why, before telling you\r\nabout thunder, I rubbed sealing-wax, a strip of paper, and the cat’s\r\nback. You shall know, but first of all listen to a little story.\r\n\r\n“More than a century ago a magistrate of the little town of Nérac, named\r\nde Romas, devised the most momentous experiment ever registered in the\r\nannals of science. One day he was seen going out into the country in a\r\nstorm, with an enormous paper kite and a ball of twine. Over two hundred\r\npersons, keenly interested, accompanied him. What in the world was that\r\ncelebrated magistrate going to do. Forgetful of his grave functions, did\r\nhe propose some diversion unworthy of him? Was it to witness a puerile\r\nkite-flying that these curious ones flocked from all points of the town?\r\nNo, no; de Romas was about to realize the most audacious project that\r\nman’s genius has ever conceived; his bold purpose was to evoke the\r\nthunderbolt from the very depths of the clouds, and to call down fire\r\nfrom heaven.\r\n\r\n“The kite that was to draw the thunderbolt from the midst of the\r\nstorm-clouds and bring it into the intrepid experimenter’s view did not\r\ndiffer from those familiar to you; only the hemp cord had through its\r\nentire length a copper thread. The wind having risen, the paper\r\ncontrivance was thrown into the air and attained a height of about two\r\nhundred meters. To the lower end of the cord was attached a silk string,\r\nand this string was made fast under the stoop of a house, to shelter it\r\nfrom the rain. A little tin cylinder was hung to the hempen cord at one\r\npoint and in touch with the metallic thread running through the cord.\r\nFinally, de Romas was furnished with a similar cylinder that had at one\r\nend a long glass tube as handle. It was with this instrument or this\r\nexciter, held in his hand by the glass handle, that he was to make the\r\nfire dart from the clouds, conducted by the copper thread of the kite to\r\nthe metallic cylinder at the end of this thread. The silk cord and the\r\nglass handle served to prevent the passage of the thunderbolt, either\r\ninto the ground or into the exciter’s arm; for these substances have the\r\nproperty of not giving passage to electricity unless it is too strong.\r\nMetals, on the contrary, let it circulate freely.\r\n\r\n“Such was the simple arrangement of the apparatus invented by de Romas\r\nto verify his audacious prevision. What is to be expected from this\r\nchild’s plaything thrown into the air to meet the thunder? Does it not\r\nseem to you foolish to suppose that such a plaything can direct the\r\nthunderbolt and master it? The magistrate of Nérac must, however, by\r\nwise meditations on the nature of thunder, have acquired the certainty\r\nof success, to dare thus, before hundreds of witnesses, to undertake\r\nthis attempt, the failure of which would cover him with confusion. The\r\nresult of this terrible conflict between thought and thunder cannot be\r\nin doubt: thought, as always, when well directed, will gain the upper\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“Behold, now, the clouds, forerunners of the storm, are coming near the\r\nkite. De Romas moves the exciter toward the tin cylinder suspended at\r\nthe end of the cord, and suddenly there is a flash of light. It is\r\nproduced by a dazzling spark which darts upon the exciter, crackles,\r\nemits a flash of lightning, and immediately disappears.”\r\n\r\n“That is just what we got yesterday evening,” observed Jules, “when we\r\nput the end of a key near the strip of warmed and rubbed paper; it is\r\nwhat the cat’s back showed us when it was stroked with the hand.”\r\n\r\n“The very same thing,” replied his uncle. “Thunder, beads of fire from\r\nthe cat, sparks from paper—all are due to electricity. But let us return\r\nto de Romas. We see that there is electricity, the thunderbolt in\r\nminiature, in the kite’s string. It is inoffensive yet, on account of\r\nits feeble quantity; so de Romas does not hesitate to draw it forth with\r\nhis finger. Every time he brings his finger near the cylinder, he draws\r\na spark like that received by the exciter. Emboldened by his example,\r\nthe spectators draw near and evoke the electric explosion. They crowd\r\naround the wonderful cylinder that now contains the fire from heaven,\r\ncalled down by man’s genius; each one wishes to call forth the\r\nlightning, and each wishes to see sparkle between his fingers the\r\nfulminant substance descended from the clouds. So they play with the\r\nthunder for half an hour with impunity, when all at once a violent spark\r\nreaches de Romas and almost knocks him over. The hour of peril has come.\r\nThe storm is getting nearer, stronger, every moment; thick clouds hover\r\nover the kite.\r\n\r\n“De Romas summons up all his firmness; he quickly makes the crowd draw\r\nback and remains alone at the side of his apparatus, in the middle of\r\nthe circle of spectators, who are beginning to get frightened. Then,\r\nwith the aid of the exciter, he elicits from the metallic cylinder first\r\nstrong sparks, capable of throwing a person down under the violence of\r\nthe commotion, then ribbons of fire that dart in serpentine lines and\r\nburst with a crash. These ribbons soon measure a length of two or three\r\nmeters. Any one struck by one of them would certainly perish. De Romas,\r\nfearing from moment to moment some fatal accident, enlarges the circle\r\nof curious spectators and ceases the perilous provocation of electric\r\nfire. But, braving imminent death, he continues his perilous\r\nobservations at close range, with the same coolness as if he were\r\nengaged in the most harmless experiment. Around him there is heard a\r\nroaring like the continuous blast of a forge; an odor of burning is in\r\nthe air; the kite-string is covered with a luminous envelope and forms a\r\nribbon of fire joining heaven to earth. Three long straws, lying by\r\nchance on the ground, start up, jump, spring toward the string, fall,\r\nspring up again, and for some minutes entertain the spectators with\r\ntheir disordered evolutions.”\r\n\r\n“Last evening,” Claire remarked, “the down of the feathers and the\r\nlittle pieces of paper jumped in the same way between the electrified\r\nsheet of paper and the table.”\r\n\r\n“That is quite natural,” said Jules, “since Uncle has just told us that\r\nthe rubbed sheet of paper takes to itself the very essence of thunder,\r\nonly in a very small quantity.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to see you grasp the close resemblance between thunder and\r\nthe electricity that we produce by rubbing certain bodies. De Romas made\r\nhis perilous experiment on purpose to prove that resemblance. I said\r\nperilous experiment; you will see, in fact, what danger the audacious\r\nexperimenter ran. Three straws, I told you, were jumping from the string\r\nto the ground, and from the ground to the string, when all at once\r\neverybody turned pale with fright: there came a violent explosion and a\r\nthunderbolt fell, making a large hole in the ground and raising a cloud\r\nof dust.”\r\n\r\n“My goodness!” gasped Claire. “Was de Romas killed?”\r\n\r\n“No, de Romas was safe and beaming with joy: his previsions were\r\nverified with a success that bordered on the prodigious: it was\r\ndemonstrated that a thunderbolt can be brought from the clouds within\r\nreach of the observer; he had proved that electricity is the cause of\r\nthunder. That, my children, was no trivial result, fit only to satisfy\r\nour curiosity: the nature of thunder being ascertained, it became\r\npossible to secure protection from its ravages, as I will tell you in\r\nthe story of the lightning-conductor.”\r\n\r\n“De Romas, who made these important experiments at the peril of his\r\nlife, must have been loaded with honors and riches by his\r\ncontemporaries,” said Claire.\r\n\r\n“Alas! my dear child,” replied her uncle, “things do not commonly happen\r\nthat way. Truth rarely finds any free spot in which to plant itself; it\r\nhas to fight against prejudice and ignorance. The battle is sometimes so\r\npainful, that men of strong will succumb to the task. De Romas, wishing\r\nto repeat his experiment at Bordeaux, was stoned by the mob, who saw in\r\nhim a dangerous man evoking thunder by his witchcraft. He was obliged to\r\nflee in haste, abandoning his apparatus.\r\n\r\n“A short time before de Romas, in the United States of North America,\r\nFranklin made similar researches on the nature of thunder. Benjamin\r\nFranklin was the son of a poor soap-manufacturer. He found at home\r\nmerely the requisite means for learning to read, write, and cipher; and\r\nyet he became by his learning one of the most remarkable men of his\r\ntime. One stormy day in 1752 he went into the country near Philadelphia,\r\naccompanied by his son, who carried a kite made of silk tied at the four\r\ncorners to two little glass rods. A metal tail terminated the apparatus.\r\nThe kite was thrown up toward a storm-cloud. At first nothing happened\r\nto confirm the learned American’s previsions: the string gave no sign of\r\nelectricity. Rain came on. The wet string let the electricity circulate\r\nmore freely; and Franklin, without thinking of the danger he ran, and\r\ntransported with joy at thus stealing its secret from the thunder,\r\nelicited with his finger a shower of sparks strong enough to set fire to\r\nspirits of wine.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n                     THUNDER AND THE LIGHTNING-ROD\r\n\r\n\r\n“BY their clever researches, Franklin, de Romas, and many others have\r\nrevealed to us the nature of lightning; they have taught us, in\r\nparticular, that when its quantity is small, it leaps to meet one’s\r\nfinger in bright, crackling sparks, without danger to the experimenter,\r\nand that all bodies containing it attract neighboring light substances,\r\njust as the kite-string attracted the straws in the experiment made by\r\nde Romas, and just as sealing-wax and rubbed paper attract the down of\r\nfeathers. In short, they taught us that electricity is the cause of\r\nthunder.\r\n\r\n“Now there are two distinct kinds of electricity, which are present in\r\nequal quantities in all bodies. As long as they are united, nothing\r\nbetrays their presence; it is as if they did not exist. But, once\r\nseparated, they seek each other across all obstacles, attract each\r\nother, and rush toward each other with an explosion and a flash of\r\nlight. Then all is in complete repose until these two electric\r\nprinciples are again separated. The two electricities, therefore,\r\nsupplement and neutralize each other; that is to say, they form\r\nsomething invisible, inoffensive, inert, that is found everywhere and is\r\ncalled neutral electricity. To electrify a body is to decompose its\r\nneutral electricity, to disunite the two principles which, when mixed,\r\nremain inert, but, separated from each other, manifest their wonderful\r\nproperties and their violent tendency to recombination. Rubbing is one\r\nway of effecting the separation of the two electric principles, but it\r\nis far from being the only one. Every radical change in the inmost\r\nnature of a body also causes a manifestation of the two electricities.\r\nSo clouds, which are water changed into vapor by the sun’s heat, are\r\noften found to be electrified.\r\n\r\n“When two differently electrified clouds come near together, immediately\r\ntheir contrary electricities run toward each other to recombine, and\r\nwith a loud report there is a burst of flame that throws a bright and\r\nsudden light. This light is lightning; this burst of flame is a\r\nthunderbolt; the noise of the explosion is thunder. Finally, the\r\nelectric spark can dart from a cloud electrified in one way to a spot on\r\nthe ground electrified in the other.\r\n\r\n“Generally you know a thunderbolt only by the sudden illumination it\r\nproduces and the crash of its explosion. To see the thunderbolt itself\r\nyou must overcome an unwarranted fear and look attentively at the\r\nclouds, the center of the storm. From moment to moment you can see a\r\ndazzling streak of light, simple or ramified, and of very irregular\r\nsinuous shape. A glowing furnace, metals at white heat, have not its\r\nbrilliancy; the sun alone furnishes a comparison worthy the sovereign\r\nsplendor of the thunderbolt.”\r\n\r\n“I saw the thunderbolt,” put in Jules, “when it struck the big pine the\r\nday of the storm. For a moment I was blinded by its brightness, as if I\r\nhad looked the sun full in the face.”\r\n\r\n“The next storm,” said Emile, “I will watch the sky to see the ribbon of\r\nfire, but on condition that uncle is there. I should not dare to alone;\r\nit is so terrible.”\r\n\r\n“I, too,” added Claire, “will do my best to overcome my fear, if Uncle\r\nis only there.”\r\n\r\n“I will be there, my children,” their uncle promised them, “if my\r\npresence reassures you, for it is a most imposing sight, that of a\r\nstormy sky set on fire by lightning and full of the rumbling of the\r\nthunder. And yet, when from the bosom of the clouds there comes the\r\ndazzling flash of the thunderbolt and the whole region echoes with the\r\ncrash of the explosion, a foolish fear dominates you; admiration has no\r\nfurther place in your mind, and your terrified eyes close at the\r\nmagnificence of the electrical phenomena of the atmosphere, proclaiming\r\nwith so much eloquence the majesty of the works of God. From your heart,\r\ncongealed with fear, there comes no outburst of gratitude, for you do\r\nnot know that at this moment, in the flashes of lightning, the uproar of\r\nthe shower, of the thunder, and of the unchained winds, a great\r\nprovidential act is being accomplished. Thunder, in fact, is far more\r\nthe cause of life than of death. In spite of the terrible but rare\r\naccidents that it causes, obeying in that the inscrutable decrees of\r\nGod, it is one of the most powerful means that Providence employs to\r\nrender the atmosphere wholesome, to clear the air we breathe of the\r\ndeadly exhalations engendered by decay. We burn straw and paper torches\r\nin our rooms to purify the air; with its immense sheets of flame the\r\nthunderbolt produces an analogous effect in the surrounding atmosphere.\r\nEach of those lightning flashes that make you start with fear is a\r\npledge of general salubrity; each of those claps of thunder that freeze\r\nyou with fear is a sign of the great work of purification that is\r\noperating in favor of life. And who does not know with what delight,\r\nafter a storm, the breast fills itself with pure air, when the\r\natmosphere, purified by the fires of the thunderbolt, gives new life to\r\nall that breathe it! Let us beware then of a foolish terror when it\r\nthunders, but lift up our thoughts to God, from whom the thunder and the\r\nlightning have received their salutary mission.\r\n\r\n“The thunderbolt, like everything in this world, plays a part in accord\r\nwith the general well-being; but, again, like everything else, it can,\r\nin fulfilling the hidden purposes of an all-seeing Providence, cause\r\nhere and there a rare accident that makes us forget the immense service\r\nit renders us. Let us always remember that nothing happens without the\r\npermission of our heavenly Father. A reverent fear of God ought to\r\nexclude all other fear. Let us, then, calmly examine the danger that a\r\nthunderbolt exposes us to. Let us remember above all that a thunderbolt\r\nby preference strikes the most prominent points of ground, for it is\r\nthere that the opposite electricity, attracted by that of the\r\nstorm-cloud, is present in greatest abundance, ready to unite with that\r\nwhich attracts it.”\r\n\r\n“The two electricities seeking reunion do their utmost to meet,” said\r\nClaire, to fix the facts in her mind. “That of the ground, in its effort\r\nto reach the cloud, gains the top of a tall tree; that of the cloud, on\r\nits side, is impelled downward toward the tree. Then comes the moment\r\nwhen the two electricities, still attracting each other but no longer\r\nhaving a road open for their peaceful reunion, rush together with a\r\ncrash. Then the streak of fire can’t help reaching the tree. Is that it,\r\nUncle!”\r\n\r\n“My dear child, I could not have put it better myself. That is why, in\r\nfact, high buildings, towers, steeples, tall trees, are the points most\r\nexposed to fire from heaven. In the open country it would be very\r\nimprudent, during a storm to seek refuge from rain under a tree,\r\nespecially a tall and isolated one. If the thunderbolt is to fall in the\r\nneighborhood, it will preferably be upon that tree, which forms a high\r\npoint where the electricity of the ground accumulates, to get as near as\r\npossible to that of the cloud attracting it. The sad and deplorable\r\ninstances every year of persons struck by lightning are for the most\r\npart confined to the imprudent who seek shelter from the rain under a\r\ntall tree.”\r\n\r\n“If you had not known about these things, Uncle,” Jules here remarked,\r\n“we should have been killed the day of the storm, when I wanted to get\r\nunder the tall pine-tree.”\r\n\r\n“It is very doubtful whether the thunderbolt, in destroying the tree,\r\nwould have spared us. It is impious boldness to expose one’s self to\r\nperil without a motive, and then to throw upon Providence the task of\r\nextricating us from our perilous situation. Heaven will help him who\r\nhelps himself. We helped ourselves by fleeing from the dangerous tree,\r\nand we arrived home safe. But to help oneself effectively requires\r\nknowledge; so, to impress these things well on your mind, I emphasize\r\nonce more the danger that, in time of storm, lurks in high towers,\r\nsteeples, lofty buildings, and, above all, in tall and isolated trees.\r\nAs for other precautions that are commonly recommended, such as not to\r\nrun, in order not to cause a violent displacement of the air, and to\r\nshut the doors and windows in order to prevent a draught, they are of no\r\nvalue whatever: the direction taken by the thunderbolt is in no way\r\naffected by the air-currents. Railway trains, which run at high speed\r\nand displace the air with so much violence, are not more exposed to\r\nlightning than objects at rest. Every-day experience is a proof of it.”\r\n\r\n“When it thunders,” said Emile, “Mother Ambroisine hurries to shut all\r\nthe doors and windows.”\r\n\r\n“Mother Ambroisine is like a great many others who believe they are safe\r\nas soon as they cease to see the peril. They shut themselves up so as\r\nnot to hear the thunder nor see the lightning; but that does not in the\r\nleast lessen the danger.”\r\n\r\n“Then there are no precautions to be taken!” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“In the usual circumstances, none, unless it be this precaution: to be\r\nof good heart and rely on the will of God.\r\n\r\n“To protect tall buildings, more menaced than others, we use a\r\nlightning-conductor, a wonderful invention due to Franklin’s genius. The\r\nlightning-conductor is composed of a rod of iron, long, strong, and\r\npointed, fastened to the top of the building. From its base starts\r\nanother rod, also of iron, which runs along the roofs and walls, where\r\nit is fastened with staples, and plunges into damp ground or, better\r\nstill, into a deep well of water. If a thunderbolt falls, it strikes the\r\nlightning-conductor, which is the nearest object to the cloud as well as\r\nthe best suited to the electric current on account of its metallic\r\nnature. Besides, its pointed form has much to do with its efficacy. The\r\nbolt that strikes the metal lightning-conductor follows it and is\r\ndissipated in the depths of the earth without causing any damage.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n                       EFFECTS OF THE THUNDERBOLT\r\n\r\n\r\n“A THUNDERBOLT overthrows, breaks, and rends bodies that do not permit\r\nelectricity to circulate freely. It shatters rocks and throws the\r\nfragments great distances; it unroofs our dwellings; it splits the\r\ntrunks of trees and divides the wood into little shreds; it overthrows\r\nwalls, or even wrenches them from their foundations. In penetrating the\r\nground, it melts the sand on its way and makes irregular glass tubes. It\r\nreddens, melts, and vaporizes metallic substances that give free passage\r\nto the electric current, such as metal chains, the iron wire of bells,\r\nthe gilding of frames. Its preference, in short, is for objects made of\r\nmetal. There are instances of persons left uninjured while the lightning\r\nconsumed the various metallic objects worn or carried by them, such as\r\ngold-lace, metal buttons, and coins. It sets fire to piles of\r\ncombustible matter like bundles of straw and stacks of dried fodder.\r\n\r\n“A feeble electric spark, like those I taught you how to get from paper,\r\nmakes but the slightest perceptible impression on us. At the very most,\r\nwe feel a little prick at the point of communication. But with the help\r\nof powerful apparatus at the disposal of science, the electric shock\r\nbecomes painful and can be dangerous, or even mortal. When one is struck\r\nby a rather strong spark, one feels, particularly in the joints, a\r\nsudden shock that makes one tremble and feel weak in the knees. With a\r\nstill stronger spark, the whole body is seized with a sudden shaking so\r\nviolent that the joints seem to be severed and one is knocked down by\r\nthe stroke. Science possesses appliances powerful enough to kill an ox\r\nwith the electric shock.\r\n\r\n“The thunderbolt, a spark incomparably stronger than that of our\r\nelectric machines, gives to men and animals an extremely violent shock;\r\nit throws them down, injures them, and even kills them instantly.\r\nSometimes a person thus struck bears traces, more or less deep, of\r\nburning; sometimes not the slightest wound is to be seen. Death is not,\r\ntherefore, as a rule, due to any wounds inflicted by the thunderbolt,\r\nbut to the sudden and violent shock given to the body. Sometimes death\r\nis only apparent: the electric shock simply suspends the primary vital\r\nfunctions, circulation and respiration. This state, which would end in\r\ndeath if prolonged, we can combat by giving the person struck the same\r\ncare bestowed upon the drowned; that is to say, by seeking to revive by\r\nfriction the respiratory movement of the breast. At other times the\r\nelectric shock more or less paralyzes some part of the body, or perhaps\r\nonly produces a passing disorder which wears off of itself.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n                                 CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nTO finish his talk on lightning, the next morning Uncle Paul told them\r\nabout clouds. The occasion, moreover, was very favorable. In one part of\r\nthe sky great white clouds like mountains of cotton were piled up. The\r\neye was delighted with the soft outlines of that celestial wadding.\r\n\r\n“You remember,” he began, “all those fogs that on damp autumn and winter\r\nmornings cover the earth with a veil of gray smoke, hide the sun, and\r\nprevent our seeing a few steps in front of us!”\r\n\r\n“Looking into the air, you could see something like fine dust of water\r\nfloating,” said Claire; and Jules added:\r\n\r\n“We played hide and seek with Emile in that kind of damp smoke. We could\r\nnot see each other a few steps away.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” resumed Uncle Paul, “clouds and fog are the same thing; only fog\r\nspreads about us and shows for what it is, gray, damp, cold; while\r\nclouds keep more or less above us and take on, with distance, a rich\r\nappearance. There are some of dazzling whiteness, like those you see\r\nover there; others of a red color, or golden-hued, or like fire; still\r\nothers of the color of ashes, and others that are black. The color\r\nchanges, too, from moment to moment. At sunset you will see a cloud\r\nbegin with being white, then turn scarlet, then shine like a pile of\r\nembers, or like a lake of melted gold, and finally become dull and turn\r\ngray or black, according as the sun’s rays strike it less and less. All\r\nthat is a matter of illumination by the sun. In reality, clouds, however\r\nsplendid in appearance, are formed of a damp vapor like that of fog. We\r\ncan assure ourselves of this by a near approach.”\r\n\r\n“People can then mount as high as the clouds, Uncle?” Emile asked.\r\n\r\n“Certainly. All one needs is a pair of legs stout enough to climb to the\r\ntop of a mountain. Often then clouds are under one’s feet.”\r\n\r\n“And you have seen clouds underneath you?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“That must be a very beautiful sight.”\r\n\r\n“So beautiful that words cannot express it. But it is not exactly a\r\npleasure if the clouds mount and envelop you. You can be very much\r\nembarrassed by the obscurity of the fog alone. You lose your way; you\r\nbecome confused, without suspecting any danger in the most dangerous\r\nplaces, at the risk of falling into some abyss; you lose sight of the\r\nguides, who alone know the way and could save you from a false step. No,\r\nall is not roses up among the clouds. You will perhaps learn that some\r\nday to your cost. Meanwhile let us transport ourselves in imagination to\r\nthe top of a cloud-capped mountain. If circumstances are favorable, here\r\nis what we shall see:\r\n\r\n“Above our heads the sky, perfectly clear, presents no unusual\r\nappearance; the sun shines there in all its brilliancy. Down there at\r\nour feet, almost in the plains, white clouds spread themselves out. The\r\nwind sweeps them before it and drives them toward the summit. There they\r\nare, rolling and mounting up the side of the mountain. One would think\r\nthey were immense flocks of cotton pushed up the slope by some invisible\r\nhand. Now and then a ray of sunlight penetrates their depths and gives\r\nthem the brilliancy of gold and fire. The beautiful clouds behind which\r\nthe sun disappears at its setting are not richer. What brilliant tints,\r\nwhat soft suppleness! They mount higher and higher. Now they roll up\r\nlike a shining white band around the top of the mountain, and hide the\r\nview of the plain from us. Only the point where we are projects above\r\nthe cloud-curtain, like an islet above the sea. At last this point is\r\ninvaded, we are in the bosom of the clouds. Warm tints, soft outlines,\r\nstriking views—all have disappeared. It is now only a dark fog that\r\nsaturates with moisture and makes us feel depressed. Ah, if some breath\r\nof wind would make haste and sweep away these disagreeable clouds!\r\n\r\n“That, my little friends, is what one does not fail to wish when one is\r\nin the clouds, which, so beautiful at a distance, are nothing but gloomy\r\nfog when close at hand. The spectacle of the clouds should be seen from\r\nafar. When in our curiosity we wish to examine certain appearances too\r\nclosely, we sometimes find them deceptive; but we also find that, under\r\na secondary brilliancy, which serves to adorn the earth, they hide\r\nrealities of the first importance. The marvels of the clouds are only an\r\nappearance, an illusion of light; but under this illusion are concealed\r\nthe reservoirs of rain, source of the earth’s fecundity. God, by whom\r\nthe smallest details of creation have been ordered, willed that the most\r\ncommon but also most necessary substances should serve as an ornament to\r\nthe earth in spite of their really humble aspect; and he clothes them\r\nwith a prestige dependent on the distance from which we are to\r\ncontemplate them. The gray vapor of the clouds gives us rain. That is\r\nits chief utility. The sun illuminates it, and that suffices to\r\ntransform it into a celestial tapestry in which the astonished eye finds\r\nthe splendor of purple, gold and fire. That is its ornamental function.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cirrus]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The height maintained by clouds is very variable and is generally less\r\nthan you might suppose. There are clouds that lazily trail along the\r\nground; they are the fogs. There are others that cling to the sides of\r\nmoderately high mountains, and still others that crown the summits. The\r\nregion where they are commonly found is at a height varying from 500 to\r\n1500 meters. In some rather rare instances they rise to nearly four\r\nleagues. Beyond that eternal serenity reigns; clouds never mount there,\r\nthunder never rumbles, and snow, hail, and rain never form.\r\n\r\n“Those clouds are called ‘cirrus’ that look sometimes like light flocks\r\nof curly wool, sometimes like drawn-out-filaments of dazzling whiteness,\r\nsharply contrasting with the deep blue of the sky. They are the highest\r\nof all the clouds. They are often a league high. When cirrus clouds are\r\nsmall and rounded and closely grouped in large numbers, so as to look\r\nlike the backs of a flock of sheep, the sky thus covered is said to be\r\ndappled. It is usually a sign that the weather is going to change.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cumulus]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The name ‘cumulus’ is given to those large white clouds with round\r\noutlines which pile up, during the heat of summer, like immense\r\nmountains of cotton-wool. Their appearance presages a storm.”\r\n\r\n“Then the clouds we see over there next to the mountains,” queried\r\nJules, “are cumulus? They look like piles of cotton. Will they bring us\r\na storm?”\r\n\r\n“I think not. The wind is driving them in another direction. The storm\r\nalways takes place in their neighborhood. There! Hear that!”\r\n\r\nA sudden light had just flashed through the flocks of the cumulus. After\r\nrather a long wait the noise of the thunder reached them, but greatly\r\nweakened by distance. Questions came quickly from Jules’s and Emile’s\r\nlips: “Why does it rain over there, and not here? Why does the noise of\r\nthe thunder come after the lightning? Why—”\r\n\r\n“We are going to talk about all that,” said Uncle Paul; “but first let\r\nus learn the other forms of clouds. ‘Stratus’ is applied to clouds\r\ndisposed in irregular bands placed in tiers on the horizon at sunrise or\r\nsunset. They are clouds that, in the fading daylight, especially in\r\nautumn, take the glowing tints of melted metals and of flame. The red\r\nstratus of the morning are followed by rain or wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stratus]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Finally, we give the name ‘nimbus’ to a mass of dark clouds of a\r\nuniform gray, so crowded together that it is impossible to distinguish\r\none cloud from another. These clouds generally dissolve into rain. Seen\r\nfrom a distance, they often look like broad stripes extending in a\r\nstraight line from heaven to earth. They are trails of rain.\r\n\r\n“Now Emile may ask his questions.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n                         THE VELOCITY OF SOUND\r\n\r\n\r\n“UNDER that big white cloud that you call cumulus,” said Emile, “there\r\nis at this very moment a storm. We have just seen the lightning and\r\nheard the thunder. Here, on the contrary, the sky is blue. So it does\r\nnot rain everywhere at the same time. When rain is falling in one\r\ncountry, it is fine in others. And yet, when it rains here the whole sky\r\nis covered with clouds.”\r\n\r\n“You need only put your hand over your eyes to hide the sky,” his uncle\r\nexplained. “A cloud much farther off, but also much larger, produces the\r\nsame effect: it veils what is surrounding us and makes it all cloudy.\r\nBut that is only in appearance; beyond the region covered by the cloud\r\nthe sky may be serene and the weather magnificent. Under the cumulus\r\nwhere the thunder is growling now, it rains, you may be sure, and the\r\nsky looks black. To the people in that region the surroundings present\r\nonly a rainy appearance, because they are wrapped in clouds; if they\r\nwere to go elsewhere, beyond the clouds, they would find the sky as\r\nserene as we have it here.”\r\n\r\n“With a fast horse they could, then,” suggested Emile, “get from under\r\nthe clouds, leave the rain, and come into fine weather; as also they\r\ncould leave the sunshine and get into the rain under the clouds.”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes that would be possible, but more often not, because clouds\r\ncan cover large areas. Besides, they travel, they go from one country to\r\nanother, with such speed that the best horseman could not follow them in\r\ntheir course. You have all seen the shadow of the clouds run over the\r\nground when the wind blows. Hills, valleys, plains, water-courses, all\r\nare crossed in less than no time. The shadow of a cloud passes over you\r\nat the moment you reach the top of a hill. Before you have taken three\r\nsteps to descend into the valley, the shadow, with giant strides, is\r\nmounting the opposite slopes. Who could flatter himself that he could\r\nfollow the cloud and keep under its cover?\r\n\r\n“If rain sometimes falls over great stretches of country, it is never\r\ngeneral, absolutely. If it should rain at one time over a whole\r\nprovince, what is that compared with the earth? A clod compared with a\r\nlarge field. Chased by the wind, clouds run hither and thither in the\r\nvast spaces of the atmosphere. They travel, and on their way throw a\r\nshadow or precipitate rain. Where they pass there is rain; everywhere\r\nelse, no. In the same place there can even be both rain and fine\r\nweather, according as one is below or above the clouds. You know that on\r\na mountain-top the clouds are sometimes beneath one. The plain under the\r\nclouds may receive a hard shower, while on the summit the sun shines\r\nwithout a single drop of rain.”\r\n\r\n“All that is easily understood,” said Jules. “It is my turn now, Uncle,\r\nto ask you a question. From the storm-cloud that we see from here, there\r\nfirst came a flash of lightning; then, after waiting some time, the\r\nsound of the thunder was heard. Why do not the sound and the lightning\r\ncome together?”\r\n\r\n“Two things tell us of the thunderbolt: light and noise. The light is\r\nthe flash of the lightning, the noise is thunder. Likewise in the\r\ndischarge of firearms there is the light produced by the ignition of the\r\npowder and the noise resulting therefrom. At the scene of the explosion\r\nlight and noise are coincident; but for persons at a distance the light,\r\nwhich travels at an incomparably greater velocity, arrives before the\r\nsound, which moves more slowly. If you note the discharge of a gun a\r\nconsiderable distance away, you see first the flash and smoke of the\r\nexplosion, and do not hear the report until some time after; the more\r\ndistant the explosion, the longer the time. Light travels an immense\r\ndistance in an exceedingly short time. The flash of the explosion,\r\ntherefore, reaches the eye at the very instant of its occurrence. If the\r\nsound does not arrive until after, it is because it travels much less\r\nrapidly and, in order to cover a considerable distance, requires\r\nconsiderable time, which is easily measured.\r\n\r\n“Suppose ten seconds pass between the flash of a cannon’s discharge and\r\nthe arrival of the sound. The distance is measured between the place\r\nwhere the explosion occurred and that where it was heard. It is found to\r\nbe 3400 meters. Sound, therefore, moves through the air, in a single\r\nsecond, a distance of 340 meters. That is a good rate of speed,\r\ncomparable with that of the cannon-ball, but nothing, after all, in\r\ncomparison with the inconceivable velocity of light.\r\n\r\n“The unequal rapidity with which sound and light travel accounts for the\r\nfollowing fact. From a distance a wood-cutter is seen chopping wood, or\r\na mason cutting stone. We see the ax strike the wood, the mallet tap the\r\nstone, and some time after we hear the sound.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bells Ringing]\r\n\r\n\r\n“One Sunday before church,” interposed Jules, “I was watching from a\r\ndistance the ringing of the bell. I saw the tongue strike and the sound\r\ndid not come until later. Now I see the reason.”\r\n\r\n“If you count the number of seconds between the appearance of the flash\r\nand the instant the thunder begins to be heard, you can tell what\r\ndistance you are from the storm-cloud.”\r\n\r\n“Is a second very long!” Emile asked.\r\n\r\n“It is about the length of one beat of the pulse. All we have to do,\r\nthen, is to count, one, two, three, four, etc., without haste, but not\r\ntoo slowly, to have about the number of seconds. Note the instant the\r\nflash lights up the stormy cumulus, and count slowly until you hear the\r\nthunder.”\r\n\r\nWith watchful eye and attentive ear all began the observation. Finally\r\na flash was seen. They counted, the uncle beating time.\r\nOne—two—three—four—five—At twelve came the thunder, but so faint that\r\nthey could only just hear it.\r\n\r\n“It took twelve seconds for the sound of the thunder to reach us,” said\r\nUncle Paul. “From what distance does it come, if sound travels 340\r\nmeters a second?”\r\n\r\n“You must multiply 340 by twelve,” replied Claire.\r\n\r\n“Well, Miss, do it.”\r\n\r\nClaire made the calculation. The result was 4080 meters.\r\n\r\n“The flash of lightning was 4080 meters away; we are more than a league\r\nfrom the storm-cloud,” said her uncle.\r\n\r\n“How easy that is!” exclaimed Emile. “You count one, two, three, four,\r\nand without moving you know how far away the thunderbolt has just\r\nfallen.”\r\n\r\n“The longer the time between the flash and the noise, the farther away\r\nis the cloud. When the report comes at the same time as the flash, the\r\nexplosion is quite near. Jules knows that well since the day of the\r\nstorm in the pine woods.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard that there is no longer any danger after the lightning is\r\nseen,” said Claire.\r\n\r\n“A thunderbolt is as rapid as light. An electric explosion is,\r\ntherefore, ended as soon as the flash appears, and all danger is then\r\npassed; for the thunder, however loud it may be, can do no harm.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n              THE EXPERIMENT WITH THE BOTTLE OF COLD WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE PAUL had rightly said, the evening before, that clouds are nothing\r\nbut fog floating high in the air instead of spreading over the earth;\r\nbut he had not said what fogs are composed of and how formed. So the\r\nnext day he continued his talk on clouds.\r\n\r\n“When Mother Ambroisine hangs the clothes she has just washed on the\r\nline, what does she do it for? To dry the linen, to free it from the\r\nwater with which it is saturated. Well, what becomes of this water, if\r\nyou please?”\r\n\r\n“It disappears, I know,” answered Jules, “but I should find it very hard\r\nto tell what becomes of it.”\r\n\r\n“This water is dissipated in the air, where it dissolves and becomes as\r\ninvisible as the air itself. When you wet a heap of dry sand, the water\r\npermeates it throughout and disappears. It is true that the sand then\r\ntakes a different appearance: it was dry before, it is wet afterward.\r\nThe sand drinks the water that comes into contact with it. Air does the\r\nsame: it drinks the moisture from the linen and becomes damp itself; and\r\nit drinks it so completely that all—air and water—remain as invisible as\r\nif the air held no foreign substance. Vapor is the name given to water\r\nthus made invisible, or in some sort aërial, that is to say resembling\r\nthe air; and the reduction of water to this new state is called\r\nevaporation. The moisture of the linen we wish to dry evaporates; the\r\nwater is dissipated in the air and thus becomes invisible vapor, which\r\nspreads in every direction at the will of the wind. The warmer it is,\r\nthe quicker and more abundant the evaporation. Have you not noticed that\r\na wet handkerchief dries very quickly in a hot sun, and loses its\r\nmoisture only very slowly if the weather is cloudy and cold?”\r\n\r\n“Mother Ambroisine is always very glad when she has a fine day for her\r\nwashing,” Claire remarked.\r\n\r\n“Remember, too, what happens after watering the garden. When, at close\r\nof a very warm day, we have to give a drink to those poor plants dying\r\nof thirst, something like this happens: The pump runs at its utmost\r\ncapacity; you all make haste with your watering-pots; one goes here,\r\nanother there, carrying water to the suffering plants, seed-plots, and\r\npotted flowers. Soon the garden has drunk copiously. How fresh it is\r\nthen, how the plants, wilted by the heat, regain vigor and straighten up\r\nagain, as happy as ever! You could almost think you heard them\r\nwhispering to one another and telling how glad they were to be watered.\r\nIf it could only stay that way! But, bah! the next day the earth is dry\r\nonce more and all has to be done over again. What has become of the last\r\nevening’s water? It has evaporated, dissolved into the air; and now it\r\nis perhaps traveling far away, at a great height, until, turned into a\r\nscrap of cloud, it falls again in rain. When Jules tires himself working\r\nthe pump to water the flowers, has he ever thought that the water drawn\r\nfrom the well and spread over the ground sooner or later is dissipated\r\nin the immensities of the air to play its modest part in the formation\r\nof clouds?”\r\n\r\n“In watering my garden,” answered Jules, “I did not think I was watering\r\nthe air more than anything else. But I see now: air is the great\r\ndrinker. Of the contents of a watering-pot the plants take perhaps a\r\nhandful; the air drinks up the rest. And that is why we have to do it\r\nall over again every day.”\r\n\r\n“And if you exposed a plateful of water to the sun what would finally\r\nbecome of it?”\r\n\r\n“I will answer that,” Emile hastened to reply. “Little by little, the\r\nwater would turn into invisible vapor and there would be nothing but the\r\nplate left.”\r\n\r\n“What takes place at the expense of a plate of water, and of the\r\nmoisture of the soil or wet linen, takes place also, on a vast scale,\r\nover the entire surface of the earth. The air is in contact with damp\r\nsoil, with innumerable sheets of water, lakes, marshes, streams, rivers,\r\nbrooks, above all with the sea, the immense sea, which presents thrice\r\nas much surface as the dry land. The great drinker, as Jules calls it,\r\nthe air, must therefore drink to satiety and everywhere and always\r\ncontain moisture, sometimes more, sometimes less, according to the heat.\r\n\r\n“The air that is around us now, that invisible air in which the eye\r\ndistinguishes nothing, nevertheless contains water that can be made\r\nvisible. The means is very simple; all that is necessary is to cool the\r\nair a little. When you squeeze a wet sponge with the hand, you make\r\nwater ooze out of it. Cold acts on moist air very much as the pressure\r\nof the hand on the sponge: it causes the moisture to distil in the form\r\nof minute drops. If Claire will go to the pump and fill a bottle with\r\nvery cold water, I will show you this curious experiment.”\r\n\r\nClaire went to the kitchen and came back with a bottle full of the\r\ncoldest water possible. Her uncle took the bottle, wiped it well with\r\nhis handkerchief so that no trace of moisture should remain on the\r\noutside, and put it on an equally well-wiped plate.\r\n\r\nNow the bottle, at first perfectly clear, becomes covered with a kind of\r\nfog which tarnishes its transparency: then little drops appear, run down\r\nits sides, and fall into the plate. At the end of a quarter of an hour\r\nthere was enough water accumulated in the plate to fill a thimble.\r\n\r\n“The drops of water now running down the outside of the bottle,” Uncle\r\nPaul explained, “do not come, it is very clear, from the inside, for\r\nglass cannot be pierced by water. They come from the surrounding air,\r\nwhich cools off on touching the bottle and lets its moisture distil. If\r\nthe bottle were colder, if full of ice, the deposit of liquid drops\r\nwould be more abundant.”\r\n\r\n“The bottle reminds me of something of the same kind,” said Claire.\r\n“When you fill a perfectly clean glass with very cold water, the outside\r\nof the glass immediately tarnishes and looks as if badly washed.”\r\n\r\n“That again is the surrounding air depositing its moisture on the cold\r\nside of the glass.”\r\n\r\n“Is that invisible moisture contained in the air abundant?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“The invisible vapor of the air is always a thing so subtle, so\r\ndisseminated, that it would take enormous volumes to make a small\r\nquantity of water. During the heat of summer, when the air holds the\r\nmost vapor, it takes 60,000 liters of moist air to furnish one liter of\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\n“That is very little,” was Jules’s comment.\r\n\r\n“It is a great deal if one thinks of the immense volume of the\r\natmosphere,” replied his uncle, and then added:\r\n\r\n“The experiment of the bottle teaches us two things: first, there is\r\nalways invisible vapor in the air; in the second place, this vapor\r\nbecomes visible and changes into fog, then into drops of water, by\r\ncooling. This return of invisible vapor to visible vapor or fog, then to\r\na state of water, is called condensation. Heat reduces water to\r\ninvisible vapor, and cold condenses this vapor, that is to say brings it\r\nback to a liquid state or at least to the state of visible vapor or fog.\r\nWe will have the rest this evening.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n                                  RAIN\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE explanations of this morning account for the formation of clouds. A\r\ncontinual evaporation takes place on the surface of the damp earth as\r\nwell as on the surface of the different sheets of water, lakes, ponds,\r\nmarshes, streams, and above all the sea. The vapors formed rise into the\r\nair and remain invisible as long as the heat is sufficient. But since\r\nheat diminishes as the height increases, there comes a time when the\r\nvapors can no longer be kept in complete solution, and they condense\r\ninto a mass of visible vapor, into a fog or cloud.\r\n\r\n“When, after a chill encountered in the upper strata of the atmosphere,\r\nthe cloud-mist reaches a certain degree of condensation, little drops of\r\nwater form and fall in rain. At first very small, they increase in\r\nvolume on the way by the union of other similar little drops. Their size\r\non reaching us is proportioned to the height from which they fell, but\r\nnever exceeds the limits suitable to the part rain is intended to play.\r\nIf too large, the rain-drops would fall heavily on the plants they are\r\nto water, and would lay them flat on the ground, dead. And what would\r\nhappen if the condensation of vapor, instead of taking place gradually,\r\nshould be sudden? There would no longer descend from heaven rain-drops,\r\nbut heavy columns of water, which, in their fall, would strip the trees\r\nof their branches, crush the harvests, and make the roofs of our houses\r\nfall in. But, far from taking this devastating form, rain falls in drops\r\nas if passed through a sieve placed by design in its passage to divide\r\nit and weaken the shock. On rare occasions, it is true, rain does reach\r\nus under so strange a disguise as to strike the ignorant with terror.\r\nWho would not be frightened when it rains blood or sulphur?”\r\n\r\n“What do you say, Uncle?” interrupted Emile; “rains blood or sulphur?\r\nFor my part, I should be dreadfully afraid.”\r\n\r\n“I too,” said Claire.\r\n\r\n“Is that true?” Jules asked, in his turn.\r\n\r\n“True. You know well I only tell you true stories. There are rains of\r\nblood and sulphur, at least in appearance. It is proved that showers\r\nhave been seen of which the drops left on the walls, roads, leaves of\r\nthe trees, and clothes of passers-by, are red spots like blood. At other\r\ntimes, with the rain, there has fallen from the sky a fine dust, of a\r\nbeautiful yellow, resembling sulphur. Did it really rain blood, sulphur?\r\nNo. This so-called rain of blood or sulphur, causing foolish alarms, is\r\nordinary rain stained with various sorts of dust raised from the ground\r\nby the wind. In the spring when, in mountainous countries, immense\r\nforests of fir-trees are in blossom, every breath of wind carries clouds\r\nof a fine yellow dust contained in the little flowers of the fir-tree.\r\nYou can see a similar dust in all flowers, especially the lily.”\r\n\r\n“It is that dust that daubs your nose yellow when you smell a lily too\r\nclose,” declared Jules.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. It is called pollen. Well, in falling at a distance, sometimes\r\nalone, sometimes accompanied by rain, the pollen gathered up from the\r\nforests by a breath of wind causes the so-called sulphur-rain.”\r\n\r\n“Your rain of blood or sulphur isn’t at all terrifying,” Claire\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n“Of course not; and yet whole populations have their hearts frozen with\r\nfear at the inoffensive fall of a whirlwind of pollen or red dust. They\r\nbelieve themselves visited with plagues, precursors of the end of the\r\nworld. Ignorance is a pitiful thing, my dear children, and knowledge is\r\na fine thing, even if it only served to deliver us from stupid terrors.”\r\n\r\n“In future,” said Jules, stoutly, “it can rain sulphur or blood; if any\r\none is afraid, it will not be I.”\r\n\r\n“There can also fall from the sky, with or without rain, various mineral\r\nsubstances, such as sand, for example, or powdered chalk, or dust from\r\nthe roads. There is even mention of showers of small animals,\r\ncaterpillars, insects, and very young toads. The marvelous feature of\r\nthese rains disappears if one considers that a violent blast of wind can\r\ncarry with it all light substances encountered in its course, and can\r\ntransport them long distances before letting them fall again.\r\n\r\n“At other times a rain of insects is due to something else besides\r\ntransportation by the wind. Some kinds of grasshoppers, for example,\r\ngather together in immense swarms to go to another district when\r\nnutriment fails them. The emigrating band flies, as at a given signal,\r\nand passes through the air in the form of a great cloud that intercepts\r\nthe daylight. The migration continues for days at a time, so numerous is\r\nthe host. Then the voracious swarm alights, like a living storm, on the\r\nvegetation of some distant province. In a few hours grass, leaves of\r\ntrees, grain, prairies—everything is browsed. The soil, as if ravaged by\r\nfire, hasn’t a blade of grass left. Sometimes the people of Algeria die\r\nof hunger. The grasshopper has devoured their harvests.\r\n\r\n“Volcanoes cause cinder-showers. Volcanic ashes is the name given to the\r\ncalcined dust thrown up to a great height by volcanoes at the moment of\r\ntheir eruption. These powdered substances form enormous clouds, which\r\nproduce in the daytime a darkness like that of the darkest nights, and\r\nwhich, falling to earth at a greater or less distance, stifle animals\r\nand plants under their showers of dust.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n                               VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n\r\n“IT is not late yet, Uncle,” said Jules; “you ought to tell us about\r\nthose terrible mountains, those volcanoes that the showers of ashes come\r\nfrom.”\r\n\r\nAt the word “volcano,” Emile, who was already asleep, rubbed his eyes\r\nand became all attention. He too wanted to hear the great story. As\r\nusual, their uncle yielded to their entreaties.\r\n\r\n“A volcano is a mountain that throws up smoke, calcined dust, red-hot\r\nstones, and melted matter called lava. The summit is hollowed out in a\r\ngreat excavation having the shape of a funnel, sometimes several leagues\r\nin circumference. That is what we call the crater. The bottom of the\r\ncrater communicates with a tortuous conduit or chimney too deep to\r\nestimate. The principal volcanoes of Europe are: Vesuvius, near Naples;\r\nEtna in Sicily; Hecla in Iceland. Most of the time a volcano is either\r\nin repose or throwing up a simple plume of smoke; but from time to time,\r\nwith intervals that may be very long, the mountain grumbles, trembles,\r\nand vomits torrents of fiery substances. It is then said to be in\r\neruption. To give you a general idea of the most remarkable phenomena\r\nattending volcanic eruption, I will choose Vesuvius, the best known of\r\nthe European volcanoes.\r\n\r\n“An eruption is generally announced beforehand by a column of smoke that\r\nfills the orifice of the crater and rises vertically, when the air is\r\ncalm, to nearly a mile in height. At this elevation it spreads out in a\r\nsort of blanket that intercepts the sun’s rays. Some days before the\r\neruption the column of smoke sinks down on the volcano, covering it with\r\na big black cloud. Then the earth begins to tremble around Vesuvius;\r\nrumbling detonations under the ground are heard, louder and louder each\r\nmoment, soon exceeding in intensity the most violent claps of thunder.\r\nYou would think you heard the cannonades of a numerous artillery\r\ndetonating ceaselessly in the mountain’s sides.\r\n\r\n“All at once a sheaf of fire bursts from the crater to the height of\r\n2000 or 3000 meters. The cloud that is floating over the volcano is\r\nillumined by the redness of the fire; the sky seems inflamed. Millions\r\nof sparks dart out like lightning to the top of the blazing sheaf,\r\ndescribe great arcs, leaving on their way dazzling trails, and fall in a\r\nshower of fire on the slopes of the volcano. These sparks, so small from\r\na distance, are incandescent masses of stone, sometimes several meters\r\nin dimension, and of a sufficient momentum to crush the most solid\r\nbuildings in their fall. What hand-made machine could throw such masses\r\nof rock to such heights? What all our efforts united could not do even\r\nonce, the volcano does over and over again, as if in play. For whole\r\nweeks and months these red blocks are thrown up by Vesuvius, in numbers\r\nlike the sparks of a display of fireworks.”\r\n\r\n“It is both terrible and beautiful,” said Jules. “Oh! how I should like\r\nto see an eruption, but far off, of course.”\r\n\r\n“And the people who are on the mountain?” questioned Emile.\r\n\r\n“They are careful not to go on the mountain at that time; they might\r\nlose their lives, suffocated by the smoke or crushed by the shower of\r\nred-hot stones.\r\n\r\n“Meantime, from the depths of the mountain, through the volcanic\r\nchimney, ascends a flux of melted mineral substance, or lava, which\r\npours out into the crater and forms a lake of fire as dazzling as the\r\nsun. Spectators who, from the plain, anxiously follow the progress of\r\nthe eruption, are warned of the coming of the lava-flood by the\r\nbrilliant illumination it throws on the volumes of smoke floating in the\r\nupper air. But the crater is full; then the ground suddenly shakes,\r\nbursts open with a noise of thunder, and through the crevasses as well\r\nas over the edges of the crater the lava flows in streams. The fiery\r\ncurrent, formed of dazzling and paste-like matter similar to melted\r\nmetal, advances slowly; the front of the lava-stream resembles a moving\r\nrampart on fire. One can flee before it, but everything stationary is\r\nlost. Trees blaze a moment on contact with the lava and sink down,\r\nreduced to charcoal; the thickest walls are calcined and fall over; the\r\nhardest rocks are vitrified, melted.\r\n\r\n“The flow of lava comes to an end, sooner or later. Then subterranean\r\nvapors, freed from the enormous pressure of the fluid mass, escape with\r\nmore violence than ever, carrying with them whirlwinds of fine dust that\r\nfloats in sinister clouds and sinks down on the neighboring plain, or is\r\neven carried by the winds to a distance of hundreds of leagues. Finally,\r\nthe terrible mountain calms down, and peace is restored for an\r\nindefinite time.”\r\n\r\n“If there are towns near the volcanoes, cannot those streams of fire\r\nreach them? Cannot those clouds of ashes bury them?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately all that is possible and has happened. I will tell you\r\nabout it to-morrow, for it is time to go to bed now.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n                                CATANIA\r\n\r\n\r\n“YESTERDAY,” Uncle Paul resumed, “Jules asked me if the lava-streams\r\ncould not reach towns situated near volcanoes. The following story will\r\nanswer his question. It is about an eruption of Mount Etna.”\r\n\r\n“Etna is that volcano in Sicily where the big chestnut tree of a hundred\r\nhorses is?” asked Claire.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I must tell you that two hundred years ago there occurred in\r\nSicily one of the most terrible eruptions on record. During the night,\r\nafter a furious storm, the earth began to tremble so violently that a\r\ngreat many houses fell. Trees swayed like reeds shaken by the wind;\r\npeople, fleeing distracted into the country to avoid being crushed under\r\nthe ruins of their buildings, lost their footing on the quaking ground,\r\nstumbled, and fell. At that moment Etna burst in a fissure four leagues\r\nlong, and along this fissure rose a number of volcanic mouths, vomiting,\r\namid the crash of frightful detonations, clouds of black smoke and\r\ncalcined sand. Soon seven of these mouths united in an abyss that for\r\nfour months did not cease thundering, glowing, and throwing up cinders\r\nand lava. The crater of Etna, at first quite at rest, as if its furnaces\r\nhad no connection with the new volcanic mouths, woke up a few days after\r\nand threw to a prodigious height a column of flames and smoke; then the\r\nwhole mountain shook, and all the crests that dominated its crater fell\r\ninto the depths of the volcano. The next day four mountaineers dared to\r\nclimb to the top of Etna. They found the crater very much enlarged by\r\nthe falling-in of the day before: its orifice, which before had measured\r\none league, now measured two.\r\n\r\n“In the meantime, torrents of lava were pouring from all the crevasses\r\nof the mountain down upon the plain, destroying houses, forests, and\r\ncrops. Some leagues from the volcano, on the seacoast, lies Catania, a\r\nlarge town surrounded then by strong walls. Already the liquid fire had\r\ndevoured several villages, when the stream reached the walls of Catania\r\nand spread over the country. There, as if to show its strength to the\r\nterrified Catanians, it tore a hill away and transported it some\r\ndistance; it lifted in one mass a field planted with vines and let it\r\nfloat for some time, until the green was reduced to charcoal and\r\ndisappeared. Finally, the fiery stream reached a wide and deep valley.\r\nThe Catanians believed themselves saved: no doubt the volcano would\r\nexhaust its strength by the time it covered the vast basin which the\r\nlava had just entered. But what an error of judgment! In the short space\r\nof six hours, the valley was filled, and the lava, overflowing, advanced\r\nstraight toward the town in a stream half a league wide and ten meters\r\nhigh. It would have been all over with Catania if, by the luckiest\r\nchance, another current, whose direction crossed the first, had not come\r\nand struck against the fiery flood and turned it from its course. The\r\nstream, thus turned, coasted the ramparts of the town within\r\npistol-shot, and turned toward the sea.”\r\n\r\n“I was very much afraid for those poor Catanians,” interposed Emile,\r\n“when you spoke of that wall of fire, high as a house, going straight\r\ntoward the town.”\r\n\r\n“All is not over yet,” his uncle proceeded. “The stream, I told you, was\r\ngoing toward the sea. There was, then, a formidable battle between the\r\nwater and the fire. The lava presented a perpendicular front of 1500\r\nmeters in extent and a dozen meters high. At the touch of that burning\r\nwall, which continued plunging further and further into the waves,\r\nenormous masses of vapor rose with horrible hissings, darkened the sky\r\nwith their thick clouds, and fell in a salt rain over all the region. In\r\na few days the lava had made the limits of the shore recede three\r\nhundred meters.\r\n\r\n“In spite of that, Catania was still menaced. The stream, swollen with\r\nnew tributaries, grew from day to day and approached the town. From the\r\ntop of the walls the inhabitants followed with terror the implacable\r\nprogress of the scourge. The lava finally reached the ramparts. The\r\nfiery flood rose slowly, but it rose ceaselessly; from hour to hour it\r\nwas found to have risen a little higher. It touched the top of the\r\nwalls, whereupon, yielding to the pressure, they were overthrown for the\r\nlength of forty meters, and the stream of fire penetrated the town.”\r\n\r\n“My goodness!” cried Claire. “Those poor people are lost?”\r\n\r\n“No, not the people, for lava runs very slowly, on account of its sticky\r\nnature, and one can be warned in time; it was the town itself that ran\r\nthe greatest risk. The quarters invaded by the lava were the highest;\r\nfrom there the current could spread everywhere. So Catania seemed\r\ndestined to total destruction, when it was saved by the courage of some\r\nmen who attempted to battle with the volcano. They bethought themselves\r\nto construct stone walls, which, placed across the route of the\r\non-coming stream, would change its direction. This device partly\r\nsucceeded, but the following was the most efficacious. Lava streams\r\nenvelop themselves in a kind of solid sheath, embank themselves in a\r\ncanal formed of blocks coagulated and welded together. Under this\r\ncovering the melted matter preserves its fluidity and continues its\r\nravaging course. They thought, then, that by breaking these natural\r\ndikes at a well-chosen spot, they would open to the lava a new route\r\nacross country and would thus turn it from the town. Followed by a\r\nhundred alert and vigorous men, they attacked the stream, not far from\r\nthe volcano, with blows of iron bars. The heat was so great that each\r\nworker could strike only two or three blows in succession, after which\r\nhe withdrew to recover his breath. However, they managed to make a\r\nbreach in the solid sheath, when, as they had foreseen, the lava flowed\r\nthrough this opening. Catania was saved, not without great loss, for\r\nalready the lava flood had consumed, within the town walls, three\r\nhundred houses and some palaces and churches. Outside of Catania, this\r\neruption, so sadly celebrated, covered from five to six square leagues\r\nwith a bed of lava in some places thirteen meters thick, and destroyed\r\nthe homes of twenty-seven thousand persons.”\r\n\r\n“Without those brave men who did not hesitate, at the risk of being\r\nburnt alive, to go and open a new passage for the stream of fire,\r\nCatania would certainly have been lost,” remarked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Catania would have been all burnt down, there is no doubt. To-day its\r\ncalcined ruins would be buried under a bed of cold lava, and there would\r\nbe nothing left but the name of the large town that had disappeared.\r\nThree or four stout-hearted men revive the courage of the terrified\r\npopulation; they hope that heaven will aid them in their devotion, and,\r\nready to sacrifice their lives, they prevent the frightful disaster. Ah!\r\nmay God give you grace, my dear child, to imitate them in the time of\r\ndanger; for, you see, if man is great through his intelligence, he is\r\nstill greater through his heart. In my old age, when I hear you spoken\r\nof, I shall be more gladdened by the good you may have done than by the\r\nknowledge you may have acquired. Knowledge, my little friend, is only a\r\nbetter means of aiding others. Remember that well, and when you are a\r\nman bear yourself in danger as did those of Catania. I ask it of you in\r\nreturn for my love and my stories.”\r\n\r\nJules furtively wiped away a tear. His uncle perceived that he had sown\r\nhis word in good ground.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\n                           THE STORY OF PLINY\r\n\r\n\r\n“TO teach you what the cinders thrown up by a volcano can do, I am now\r\ngoing to tell you a very old story, just as it was transmitted to us by\r\na celebrated writer of those old times. This writer is called Pliny. His\r\nwriting is in Latin, the great language of those days.\r\n\r\n“It was in the year 79 of our era. Contemporaries of our Savior were\r\nstill living. Vesuvius was then a peaceful mountain. It was not\r\nterminated then, as to-day, by a smoking cone, but by a table-land\r\nslightly concave, the remains of an old filled-up crater where thin\r\ngrasses and wild vines grew. Very fertile crops covered its sides; two\r\npopulous towns, Herculaneum and Pompeii, lay stretched at its base.\r\n\r\n“The old volcano, which seemed forever lulled, and whose last eruptions\r\nwent back to times beyond the memory of man, suddenly awakened and began\r\nto smoke. On the 23d of August, about one o’clock in the afternoon, an\r\nextraordinary cloud, sometimes white, sometimes black, was seen hovering\r\nover Vesuvius. Impelled violently by some subterranean force, it first\r\nrose straight up in the form of a tree-trunk; then, after attaining a\r\ngreat height, it sank down under its own weight and spread out over a\r\nwide area.\r\n\r\n“Now, there was at that time at Messina, a seaport not far from\r\nVesuvius, an uncle of the author who has handed down these things to us.\r\nHe was called Pliny, like his nephew. He commanded the Roman fleet\r\nstationed at this port. He was a man of great courage, never retreating\r\nfrom any danger if he could gain new knowledge or render aid to others.\r\nSurprised at the singular cloud that hovered over Vesuvius, Pliny\r\nimmediately set out with his fleet to go to the aid of the menaced coast\r\ntowns and to observe the terrible cloud from a nearer point. The people\r\nat the foot of Vesuvius were fleeing in haste, wild with fear. He went\r\nto the side where all were in flight and where the peril appeared the\r\ngreatest.”\r\n\r\n“Fine!” cried Jules. “Courage comes to you when you are with those who\r\nare not afraid. I love Pliny for hastening to the volcano to learn about\r\nthe danger. I should like to have been there.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! my poor child, you would not have found it a picnic. Burning\r\ncinders mixed with calcined stones were falling on the vessels; the sea,\r\nlashed to fury, was rising from its bed; the shore, encumbered with\r\ndebris from the mountain, was becoming inaccessible. There was nothing\r\nto do but retreat. The fleet came to land at Stabiæ, where the danger,\r\nstill distant, but all the time approaching, had already caused\r\nconsternation. In the meantime, from several points on Vesuvius great\r\nflames burst forth, their terrifying glare rendered more frightful by\r\nthe darkness caused by the cloud of cinders. To reassure his companions\r\nPliny told them that these flames came from some abandoned villages\r\ncaught by the fire.”\r\n\r\n“He told them that to give them courage,” Jules conjectured, “but he\r\nhimself well knew the truth of the matter.”\r\n\r\n“He knew it well, he knew the danger was great; nevertheless, overcome\r\nby fatigue, he fell into a deep sleep. Now, while he slept, the cloud\r\nreached Stabiæ. Little by little the court leading to his apartment was\r\nfilled with cinders, so that in a short time he would not have been able\r\nto get out. They woke him to prevent his being buried alive and to\r\ndeliberate on what was to be done. The houses, shaken by continual\r\nshocks, seemed to be torn from their foundations; they swayed from side\r\nto side. Many fell. It was decided to put to sea again. A shower of\r\nstones was falling—small ones, it is true, and calcined by the fire. As\r\na protection from them, the men covered their heads with pillows, and\r\ngoing through the most horrible darkness, hardly relieved by the light\r\nof the torches they carried, they made their way toward the shore. There\r\nPliny sat on the ground a moment to rest, when violent flames,\r\naccompanied by a strong smell of sulphur, put everybody to flight. He\r\nrose and then instantly fell back dead. The emanations, cinders, and\r\nsmoke from the volcano had suffocated him.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Pliny! To be stifled to death like that by the horrible mountain,\r\nand he so courageous!” lamented Jules.\r\n\r\n“Whilst the uncle was dying at Stabiæ, the nephew, left at Messina with\r\nhis mother, was witness of what he relates to us. ‘The night after my\r\nuncle’s departure,’ he tells us, ‘the earth began to tremble violently.\r\nMy mother hastened in alarm to waken me. She found me getting up to go\r\nand waken her. As the house threatened to collapse, we sat outside in\r\nthe court, not far from the sea. With the carelessness of youth—I was\r\nthen eighteen—I began to read. A friend of my uncle’s came along. Seeing\r\nmy mother and me both of us seated, and me with a book in my hand, he\r\nblamed us for our confidence and induced us to look out for our safety.\r\nAlthough it was seven o’clock in the morning, we could hardly see, the\r\nair was so obscured. At times buildings were so shaken that their fall\r\nwas imminent at any moment. We followed the example of the rest and left\r\nthe town. We stopped some distance off in the country. The wagons that\r\nwere brought away swayed continually with the shaking of the ground.\r\nEven with their wheels blocked with stones they could hardly be held in\r\nplace. The sea flowed back on itself: driven from the shore by the\r\nearthquake shocks, it receded from the beach and left a multitude of\r\nfish dry on the sand. A horrible black cloud came toward us. On its\r\nflanks were serpentine lines of fire like immense flashes of lightning.\r\nSoon the cloud descends, covering earth and sea. Then my mother begs me\r\nto flee with all the speed of my youth, and not to expose myself to\r\nimminent death by adapting my pace to hers, weighed down as she was by\r\nyears. She would die content if she knew I was out of danger.’”\r\n\r\n“And Pliny left his old mother behind in order to get away the faster?”\r\nqueried Jules.\r\n\r\n“No, my child, he did what you would all have done. He remained,\r\nsustaining and encouraging her, resolved to save himself with her or\r\nelse die with her.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” cried Jules. “The nephew was worthy of his uncle. And then what\r\nhappened?”\r\n\r\n“Then it was frightful. Cinders began to fall; darkness descended, so\r\nintense that they could see nothing. There was general confusion,\r\noutcry, and moaning. Wild with terror, the people fled at random,\r\nknocking down and treading on those who were in their way. The greater\r\npart were convinced that that night was the last, the eternal night that\r\nwas to swallow the world. Mothers went groping for their children, lost\r\nin the crowd or perhaps crushed under the feet of the fugitives; they\r\ncalled them with doleful cries to embrace them once more and then die.\r\nPliny and his old mother had seated themselves apart from the crowd.\r\nFrom time to time they were obliged to get up and shake off the cinders\r\nwhich would soon have buried them. At last the cloud dispersed and\r\ndaylight reappeared. The earth was unrecognizable; everything had\r\ndisappeared under a thick shroud of calcined dust.”\r\n\r\n“And the houses, were they buried in the cinders?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“At the foot of the mountain the dust thrown up by the volcano lay\r\ndeeper than the height of the tallest houses, and whole towns had\r\ndisappeared under the enormous bed of cinders. Amongst these were\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii. The volcano buried them alive.”\r\n\r\n“With the inhabitants?” inquired Jules.\r\n\r\n“With a small number, for most of them, like Pliny and his mother, had\r\ntime to flee to Messina. To-day, after being buried eighteen centuries,\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii are exhumed by the miner’s pick, just as they\r\nwere when caught by the cloud of volcanic cinders. Vineyards cover them\r\nwhere they are not yet cleared.”\r\n\r\n“These vineyards, then, are the roofs of houses!” said Emile.\r\n\r\n“Higher than the roofs of houses. The traveler who visits the quarters\r\nnot yet uncovered, but made accessible by means of wells dug for the\r\npurpose, descends under-ground to a great depth.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n                            THE BOILING POT\r\n\r\n\r\nAS their uncle finished speaking, the postman came with a letter. A\r\nfriend advised Uncle Paul to go to town on pressing business, and he\r\nwished to take advantage of the occasion to give his nephews the\r\ndiversion of a little journey. He had Jules and Emile dressed in their\r\nSunday clothes, and they set out to wait for the train at the\r\nneighboring station. At the station Uncle Paul went up to a grating\r\nbehind which was a very busy man, and through a wicket he handed him\r\nsome money. In exchange the busy man gave him three pieces of cardboard.\r\nUncle Paul presented these pieces of cardboard to a man who guarded the\r\nentrance to a room. The man looked and let them enter.\r\n\r\nHere they are in what is called the waiting-room. Emile and Jules open\r\ntheir eyes wide and say nothing. Soon they hear steam hissing. The train\r\narrives. At its head is the locomotive, which slackens its speed so as\r\nto stop a moment. Through the window of the waiting-room Jules sees the\r\npeople passing. Something preoccupies him: he is trying to understand\r\nhow the heavy machine moves, what turns its wheels, which seem to be\r\npushed by an iron bar.\r\n\r\nThey enter the railway car, the steam hisses, the train starts, and they\r\nare off. After a moment, when full speed had been gained: “Uncle Paul,”\r\nsaid Emile, “see how the trees run, dance, and whirl around!” His uncle\r\nmade him a sign to be silent. He had two reasons for this: first, Emile\r\nhad just made a foolish remark, and, secondly, his uncle did not choose\r\nto notice the giddy-pate’s self-betrayal in public.\r\n\r\nBesides, Uncle Paul is not very communicative when traveling; he prefers\r\nto maintain a discreet reserve and keep silence. There are people whom\r\nyou have never seen before, and perhaps will never see again, who\r\nimmediately become very familiar with their traveling companions. Rather\r\nthan hold their tongues they would talk to themselves. Uncle Paul does\r\nnot like such people; he considers them weak-minded.\r\n\r\nBy evening the three travelers had returned, all much pleased with their\r\ntrip. Uncle Paul had brought to a favorable conclusion his business in\r\ntown. Emile and Jules each came back with an idea. When they had done\r\nhonor to the excellent supper Mother Ambroisine had prepared on purpose\r\nto wind up the holiday with a little treat, Jules was the first to\r\nimpart his idea to his uncle.\r\n\r\n“Of all that I saw to-day,” he began, “what struck me most was the\r\nengine at the head of the train, the locomotive that draws the long\r\nstring of cars. How do they make it move? I looked well, but could not\r\nfind out. It looks as if it went by itself, like a great beast on the\r\ngallop.”\r\n\r\n“It does not go by itself,” replied his uncle; “it is steam that puts it\r\nin motion. Let us, then, first learn what steam is and what its power.\r\n\r\n“When water is put on the fire, it first gets hot, then begins to boil,\r\nsending off vapor, which is dissipated in the air. If the boiling\r\ncontinues some time, it ends with there being nothing in the pot; all\r\nthe water has disappeared.”\r\n\r\n“That is what happened to Mother Ambroisine day before yesterday,” put\r\nin Emile. “She was boiling some potatoes, and having neglected to look\r\ninto the pot for some time, she found them without a drop of water, half\r\nburnt. She had to begin all over again. Mother Ambroisine was not\r\npleased.”\r\n\r\n“By heat,” continued Uncle Paul, “water becomes invisible, intangible,\r\nas subtle as air. That is what is called vapor.”\r\n\r\n“You told us that the moisture in the air, the cause of fogs and clouds,\r\nis also vapor.” This from Claire.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is vapor, but vapor formed only by the heat of the sun. Now,\r\nyou must know that the stronger the heat, the more abundant is the\r\nvapor. If you put a pot full of water on the fire, the burning heat of\r\nthe grate sets free incomparably more vapor than the temperature of a\r\nhot summer sun could. As long as it escapes freely from the pot, the\r\nvapor thus formed has nothing remarkable about it; so your attention has\r\nnever been arrested by the fumes of a boiling pot. But if the pot is\r\ncovered, covered tight, so as not to leave the slightest opening, then\r\nthe steam, which tends to expand to an enormous volume, is furious to\r\nget out of its prison; it pushes and thrusts in all directions to remove\r\nthe obstacles that oppose its expansion. However solid it may be, the\r\npot ends by bursting under the indomitable pushing of the imprisoned\r\nsteam. That is what I am going to show you with a little bottle, and not\r\nwith a pot, which would not shut tight enough and the cover of which\r\ncould be easily pushed off by the steam. And besides, even if I had a\r\nsuitable pot, I should take care not to use it, for it might blow the\r\nhouse up and kill us all.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul took a glass vial, put a finger’s breadth of water into it,\r\ncorked it tightly with a cork stopper, and then tied the cork with a\r\npiece of wire. The vial thus prepared was put on the ashes before the\r\nfire. Then he took Emile, Jules, and Claire, and drew them quickly into\r\nthe garden, to see from a distance what would happen, without fear of\r\nbeing injured by the explosion. They waited a few minutes, then _boom!_\r\nThey ran up and found the vial broken into a thousand pieces scattered\r\nhere and there with extreme violence.\r\n\r\n“The cause of the explosion and the bursting of the bottle was the\r\nsteam, which, having no way of escape, accumulated and exerted against\r\nits prison walls a stronger and stronger pressure as the temperature\r\nrose. A time then came when the vial could no longer resist the pressure\r\nof the steam, and it burst to pieces. They call elastic force the\r\npressure exerted by steam on the inside of pots that hold it prisoner.\r\nThe greater the heat, the stronger the pressure. With heat enough it may\r\nacquire an irresistible power, capable of bursting, not only a glass\r\nbottle, but also the thickest, most solid pots of iron, bronze, or any\r\nother very resistant material. Is it necessary to say that under those\r\nconditions the explosion is terrific? The fragments of the pot are\r\nthrown with a violence comparable to that of a cannon-ball or a bursting\r\nbomb. Everything standing in the way is broken or knocked down. Powder\r\ndoes not produce more terrific results. What I have just shown you with\r\nthe glass vial is also not without some danger. You can be blinded with\r\nthis dangerous experiment, which it is well to see once under proper\r\nprecautions, but which it would be imprudent for you to repeat. I forbid\r\nyou all, understand, to heat water in a closed vial; it is a game that\r\nmight cost you your eyesight. If you should disobey me on this point,\r\ngood-by to stories; I would not keep you with me any longer.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be afraid, Uncle,” Jules hastened to interpose; “we will be\r\ncareful not to repeat the experiment; it is too dangerous.”\r\n\r\n“Now you know what makes the locomotive and a great many other machines\r\nmove. In a strong boiler, tightly closed, steam is formed by the action\r\nof a hot furnace. This steam, of an enormous power, makes every effort\r\nto escape. It presses particularly on a piece placed for that purpose,\r\nwhich it chases before it. From that a movement results that sets\r\neverything going, as you will see in the case of the locomotive. To\r\nconclude, let us remember that in every steam engine the essential\r\nthing, the generator of the force, is a boiler, a closed pot that\r\nboils.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\n                             THE LOCOMOTIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE PAUL showed his nephews the following picture, and explained it to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An old-time Locomotive]\r\n\r\n\r\n“This picture represents a locomotive. The boiler where the steam is\r\ngenerated, the boiling pot, in short, forms the greater part of it. It\r\nis the large cylinder that goes from one end to the other, borne on six\r\nwheels. It is built of solid iron plates, perfectly joined together with\r\nlarge rivets. In front the boiler terminates in a smoke-stack; behind,\r\nin a furnace, the door of which is represented as open. A man, called a\r\nstoker, is constantly occupied in filling the furnace with pit-coal,\r\nwhich he throws in by the shovelful; for he must keep up a very hot fire\r\nto heat the volume of water contained in the boiler and obtain steam in\r\nsufficient quantity. With an iron bar he pokes the fire, arranges it,\r\nmakes it burn fast. That is not all: skilful arrangements are made to\r\nutilize the heat and warm the water quickly. From the end of the furnace\r\nstart numerous copper pipes which traverse the water from one end to the\r\nother of the boiler, and terminate at the smoke-stack. You will see some\r\nin B where the picture supposes a part of the casing taken away to show\r\nthe interior. The flame of the furnace runs through these pipes,\r\nthemselves surrounded by water. By this means the fire is made to\r\ncirculate through the very midst of the water, and so steam is obtained\r\nvery quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A modern Locomotive]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now look at the front of the locomotive. In A is seen a short cylinder\r\nclosed tightly, but represented in the picture with a part of the\r\noutside removed to show what is within. There are two of these\r\ncylinders, one on the right, the other on the left of the locomotive.\r\nInside the cylinder is an iron stopper called a piston. The steam from\r\nthe boiler enters the cylinder alternately in front of and behind the\r\npiston. When the steam comes in front, what is behind escapes freely\r\ninto the air by an orifice that opens of itself at the right moment.\r\nThis escaping steam ceases to press on the piston, since it finds its\r\nprison open and that it can get out. We do not try to force doors when\r\nother outlets are open. So does steam act: the instant it can escape\r\nfreely, it ceases to push. The entering steam, on the contrary, finds\r\nitself imprisoned. It pushes the piston, therefore, with all its\r\nstrength and drives it to the other end of the cylinder. But then the\r\nrôles immediately change. The steam that hitherto has been pushing,\r\nescapes into the air and ceases to act, while on the other side a jet of\r\nsteam rushes in from the boiler and begins to push in the contrary\r\ndirection.”\r\n\r\n“Let me repeat it,” said Jules, “to see if I have understood it\r\nproperly. Steam comes from the boiler, where it forms unceasingly. It\r\ngoes into the cylinder before and behind the piston by turns. When it\r\ngets in front, that behind escapes into the air and no longer pushes;\r\nwhen it gets behind, that in front escapes. The piston, pushed first one\r\nway, then the other, alternately, must advance and retreat, go and come,\r\nin the cylinder. And then?”\r\n\r\n“The piston is in the form of a solid iron rod that enters the cylinder\r\nthrough a hole pierced in the middle of one of the ends, and just large\r\nenough to give free passage to the rod, without letting the steam\r\nescape. This rod is bound to another iron piece called a crank, and\r\nfinally the crank is attached to the neighboring wheel. In the picture\r\nall these things can easily be seen. The piston, advancing and\r\nretreating in turn in the cylinder, pushes the crank forward and back,\r\nand the crank thus makes the great wheel turn. On the other side of the\r\nlocomotive the same things are taking place by means of a second\r\ncylinder. Then the two great wheels turn at the same time and the\r\nlocomotive moves forward.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t so hard as I thought,” Jules remarked. “Steam pushes the\r\npiston, the piston pushes the crank, the crank pushes the wheel, and the\r\nengine moves.”\r\n\r\n“After acting on the piston, the steam enters the same chimney that the\r\nsmoke comes out of. So you can see this smoke-stack sometimes throwing\r\nout white puffs, sometimes black. These latter are smoke coming from the\r\nfurnace through the tubes that go through the water; the others come\r\nfrom the steam thrown out of the cylinders after each stroke of the\r\npiston. These white puffs, in rushing violently from the cylinder to the\r\nsmoke-stack after acting on the piston, make the noise of the engine as\r\nit moves.”\r\n\r\n“I know: _pouf! pouf! pouf!_” exclaimed Emile.\r\n\r\n“The locomotive carries with it a supply of coal to feed the fire, and a\r\nsupply of water to renew the contents of the boiler as fast as\r\nevaporation may require. These supplies are carried in the tender; that\r\nis to say, in the vehicle that comes immediately behind the locomotive.\r\nOn the tender are the stoker, who tends the furnace, and the engineer,\r\nwho controls the passage of the steam into the cylinders.”\r\n\r\n“The man in the picture is the engineer?” Emile asked.\r\n\r\n“He is the engineer. He holds his hand on the throttle, which allows the\r\nsteam from the boiler to enter the cylinders in greater or less\r\nquantity, according to the speed he wishes to obtain. By one movement of\r\nthe throttle, the steam is cut off from the cylinders and the engine\r\nstops; by another movement the steam is admitted and the locomotive\r\nmoves, slowly or rapidly at will.\r\n\r\n“The power of a locomotive is no doubt considerable; however, if it is\r\nable to draw with great speed a long train of cars, all heavily loaded,\r\nthis is due, above all, to the preparation of the road on which it runs.\r\nStrong bars of iron, called rails, are fixed solidly on the road, all\r\nalong its length, in two parallel lines, on which all the wheels of the\r\ntrain roll without ever running off. A light flange with which the\r\nwheels are furnished keeps the train from slipping off the rails.\r\n\r\n“The iron road not having the inconveniences of other roads, that is to\r\nsay the ruts, pebbles, and inequalities that impede the progress of\r\ncarriages and cause the waste of much energy, the whole traction of the\r\nlocomotive is utilized, and the results obtained are wonderful. A\r\npassenger engine draws at a rate of twelve leagues an hour a train\r\nweighing as much as 150,000 kilograms. A freight engine pulls at about\r\nseven leagues an hour a total weight of 650,000 kilograms. More than\r\n1300 horses would be necessary to replace the first locomotive, and more\r\nthan 2000 to replace the second, if they were employed to transport\r\nsimilar loads with the same velocity and to the same distances by the\r\naid of cars running on rails. What an army of horses it would require\r\nwith wagons running on ordinary roads having all the inequalities that\r\ncause such a great loss of energy!\r\n\r\n“And now, my little friends, think of the thousands of locomotives\r\nrunning daily in all parts of the world, annihilating distances, as it\r\nwere, and bringing the most distant nations together; think what a vast\r\nnumber of machines of all kinds, moved by steam, are ceaselessly working\r\nfor man; think how the engine that makes a warship move, sometimes\r\nrepresents in itself the united strength of 42,000 horses; think of all\r\nthese things, and see what inconceivable development of power man’s\r\ngenius has given to him with a few shovelfuls of coal burning under a\r\npot of water!”\r\n\r\n“Who first thought of the use of steam?” asked Jules. “I should like to\r\nremember his name.”\r\n\r\n“The use of steam as a mechanical power was proposed nearly two hundred\r\nyears ago by one of the glories of France, the unfortunate Denis Papin,\r\nwho, after giving the first suggestion of the steam-engine, source of\r\nincalculable riches, languished in a foreign land, poverty-stricken and\r\nforlorn. To realize his fruitful idea, which was to increase man’s\r\nmotive power a hundredfold, he could hardly find a paltry half-crown.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER L\r\n\r\n                          EMILE’S OBSERVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nEMILE’S turn came to tell what he had seen.\r\n\r\n“When you made me a sign to be silent,” said he, “it seemed to me as if\r\nthe trees were walking. Those along the railroad were going very fast;\r\nfarther away, the big poplars, ranged in long rows, were going with\r\ntheir heads waving as if saying good-by to us. Fields turned around,\r\nhouses fled. But on looking closer I soon saw that we were moving and\r\nall the rest was motionless. How strange! You see something running that\r\nis really not moving at all.”\r\n\r\n“When we are comfortably seated in the railway car,” his uncle replied,\r\n“without any effort on our part to go forward, how can we judge of our\r\nmotion except by the position we occupy in relation to the objects that\r\nsurround us? We are aware of the way we are going by the continual\r\nchanging of the objects in sight, and not by any feeling of fatigue,\r\nsince we do not move our legs. But the objects and people nearest to us\r\nand always before our eyes, our traveling companions and the furnishings\r\nof the car, remain for us in the same position. The left-hand neighbor\r\nis always at the left, the one in front is always in front. This\r\napparent immobility of everything in the car makes us lose consciousness\r\nof our own movement; then we think ourselves immobile and fancy we see\r\nflying in an opposite direction exterior objects, which are always\r\nchanging as we look at them. Let the train stop, and immediately trees\r\nand houses cease moving, because we no longer have a shifting point of\r\nview. A simple carriage drawn by horses, a boat borne along by the\r\ncurrent, lend themselves to this same curious illusion. Every time we\r\nourselves are gently moved along, we tend, more or less, to lose\r\nconsciousness of this movement, and surrounding objects, in reality\r\nimmobile, seem to us to move in a contrary direction.”\r\n\r\n“Without being able to explain it to myself well,” returned Emile, “I\r\nsee that it is so. We move and we think we see the other things moving.\r\nThe faster we go, the faster the other things seem to go.”\r\n\r\n“You hardly suspect, my little friends, that Emile’s naïve observation\r\nleads us straight to one of the truths that science has had the most\r\ntrouble in getting accepted, not on account of its difficulty, but\r\nbecause of an illusion that has always deceived most people.\r\n\r\n“If men passed their whole life on a railroad, without ever getting out\r\nof the car, stopping, or changing speed, they would firmly believe trees\r\nand houses to be in motion. Except by profound reflection, of which not\r\neverybody is capable, how could it be otherwise, since none would have\r\nseen the testimony of their eyes contradicted by experience? Of those\r\nthat have been convinced, one sharper than the others rises and says\r\nthis: ‘You imagine that the mountains and houses move while you remain\r\nat rest. Well, it is just the opposite: we move and the mountains,\r\nhouses, and trees stand still.’ Do you think many would agree with him?\r\nWhy! they would laugh at him, for each one sees, with his own eyes,\r\nmountains running, houses traveling. I tell you, my children, they would\r\nlaugh at him.”\r\n\r\n“But, Uncle—” began Claire.\r\n\r\n“There is no _but_. It has been done. They have done worse than laugh;\r\nthey have become red with anger. You would have been the first to laugh,\r\nmy girl.”\r\n\r\n“I should laugh at somebody asserting that the car moves and not the\r\nhouses and mountains?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for an error that accompanies us all through life and that every\r\none shares, is not so easily removed from the mind.”\r\n\r\n“It is impossible!”\r\n\r\n“It is so possible that you yourself, at every turn, make the mountain\r\nmove and the car that carries us stand still.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand.”\r\n\r\n“You make the round earth, the car that bears us through celestial\r\nspace, stand still; and you give motion to the sun, the giant star that\r\nmakes our earth seem as nothing by comparison. At least, you say the sun\r\nrises, pursues its course, sets, and begins its course again the next\r\nday. The enormous star moves, the humble earth tranquilly watches its\r\nmotion.”\r\n\r\n“The sun does certainly seem to us,” said Jules, “to rise at one side of\r\nthe sky and set at the other, to give us light by day. The moon does the\r\nsame, and the stars too, to give us light at night.”\r\n\r\n“Listen then to this. I have read, I don’t know where, of an eccentric\r\nperson whose wrong-headedness could not reconcile him to simple methods.\r\nTo attain the simplest result he would use means whose extravagance\r\ncaused every one to laugh. One day, wishing to roast a lark, what do you\r\nthink he took it into his head to do? I will give you ten, a hundred\r\nguesses. But, bah! you would never guess it. Just imagine! He\r\nconstructed a complicated machine, with much wheelwork and many cords,\r\npulleys, and counterpoises; and when it was started there was a variety\r\nof movement, back and forth, up and down. The noise of the springs and\r\nthe grinding of the wheels biting on each other was enough to make one\r\ndeaf. The house trembled with the fall of the counterpoises.”\r\n\r\n“But what was the machine for?” asked Claire. “Was it to turn the lark\r\nin front of the fire?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed; that would have been too simple. It was to turn the fire\r\nbefore the lark. The lighted firebrands, the hearth and chimney, dragged\r\nheavily by the enormous machine, all turned around the lark.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that beats all!” Jules ejaculated.\r\n\r\n“You laugh, children, at this odd idea; and yet, like that eccentric\r\nman, you make the firebrands, hearth, the whole house turn around a\r\nlittle bird on the spit. The earth is the little bird; the house is the\r\nheavens, with their enormous, innumerable stars.”\r\n\r\n“The sun isn’t very big—at most, as large as a grindstone,” said Jules.\r\n“The stars are only sparks. But the earth is so large and heavy!”\r\n\r\n“What did you just say? the sun as large as a grindstone? the stars only\r\nlittle sparks? Ah, if you only knew! Let us begin with the earth.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER LI\r\n\r\n                   A JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\n“A SMALL boy, of Jules’s age and, like him, desirous to learn, one\r\nmorning was making his preparations for a journey. Never had a navigator\r\ngetting ready for a voyage over distant seas shown more zeal.\r\nProvisions, the first necessity in long expeditions, were not forgotten.\r\nBreakfast was doubled. There were in the basket six nuts, a\r\nbread-and-butter sandwich, and two apples! Where can one not go with all\r\nthat? The family was not informed: they might have dissuaded the\r\naudacious traveler from his project by acquainting him with the perils\r\nof the expedition. For fear of softening before his mother’s tears, he\r\nkept silent. Basket in hand, without saying good-by to any one, he takes\r\nhis departure. Soon he is in the country. To left or right makes no\r\ndifference to him; all roads lead whither he wishes to go.”\r\n\r\n“Where does he want to go?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“To the end of the world. He takes the right-hand road, which is\r\nbordered by a hawthorn hedge where golden green beetles rustle and\r\nshine. But the beautiful insects do not stop him for a moment, nor yet\r\nthe little red-bellied fish that play in the streamlet. The day is so\r\nshort and the journey so long! He keeps on walking straight ahead,\r\nsometimes shortening the distance by cutting across fields. At the end\r\nof an hour the sandwich, chief item in the provisions, had been eaten,\r\nalthough the eating of it was regulated by the wise economy of a prudent\r\ntraveler. Quarter of an hour later an apple and three nuts were gone.\r\nAppetite comes quickly to those who tire themselves. It comes so quickly\r\nthat at a turn of the road, in the shade of a large willow, the second\r\napple and the three remaining nuts are taken out of the basket. The\r\nprovisions were exhausted, and (no less grave a matter) legs refused to\r\ngo. Just imagine the situation. The journey had lasted two hours, and\r\nthe end proposed was no nearer, not a bit. The little boy retraced his\r\nsteps, persuaded that with better legs and more provisions he would\r\nsucceed another time in his project.”\r\n\r\n“What was this project?” Jules asked.\r\n\r\n“I told you: the audacious child wished to reach the end of the world.\r\nAccording to his ideas, the sky was a blue vault, which kept getting\r\nlower until it rested on the edge of the earth, so that, if ever he\r\narrived there, he would have to walk bent over so as not to bump his\r\nhead against the firmament. He started with the idea that he should soon\r\nbe able to touch the sky with his hand; but the blue vault, retiring as\r\nhe advanced, was always at the same distance. Fatigue and want of\r\nprovisions made him renounce further continuance of his journey.”\r\n\r\n“If I had known that little boy,” said Emile, “I would have dissuaded\r\nhim from his expedition. It is impossible, however far one goes, to\r\ntouch the sky with the hand, even with the help of the tallest ladder.”\r\n\r\n“If I remember aright, Emile has not always been of that opinion,” said\r\nhis uncle.\r\n\r\n“That is true, Uncle. Like the little boy you have been telling about, I\r\nbelieved that the sky was a large blue cover resting on the earth. By\r\ngood walking one ought to reach the edge of the cover and the end of the\r\nworld. I thought, too, that the sun rose behind these mountains, and set\r\nbehind those on the opposite side, where there was a deep well that the\r\nsun plunged into and remained hidden during the night. One day you took\r\nme to the mountains where the edges of the blue cover seem to rest. It\r\nwas a long way off, I remember; you lent me your cane, which helped me\r\nin walking. I did not see any well for the sun to plunge into;\r\neverything looked just as it does here. The edge of the sky still seemed\r\nto rest on the earth, only much farther away. And you told me that by\r\ngoing to the end of what we saw, then farther and farther still, we\r\nshould find the same appearance everywhere, without ever seeing the end\r\nof a vault that does not really exist.”\r\n\r\n“Nowhere, as all three of you know, does the sky rest on the earth;\r\nnowhere is there any danger of striking one’s head against the\r\nfirmament; everywhere the blue vault has the same appearance as here.\r\nYou know, too, that in always going ahead you meet with plains,\r\nmountains, valleys, water-courses, seas; but nowhere are there any\r\nbarriers marking the limits of the world.\r\n\r\n“Imagine a large ball suspended in the air by a thread, and on this ball\r\na gnat. If this gnat should take a notion to go all over the surface, is\r\nit not true that it could come and go over the ball, above, below, on\r\nthe side, without ever encountering an obstacle, without ever seeing a\r\nbarrier rise up to block its passage? Is it not equally true that if it\r\nalways kept on in the same direction, the gnat would end by making the\r\ntour of the ball and would come back to its starting-point? So it is\r\nwith us on the surface of the earth, though we are far more\r\ninsignificant when compared with the globe that bears us than is the\r\ntiniest gnat in comparison with the biggest ball you can imagine.\r\nWithout ever encountering a barrier, without ever touching the cupola of\r\nthe sky, we come and go in a thousand different directions, we\r\naccomplish the most distant journeys, even make the tour of the earth\r\nand return to our starting-point. The earth, then, is round; it is an\r\nimmense ball that swims without support in celestial space. As to the\r\nblue vault that arches above us, it is mere appearance caused by the\r\nblue color of the air enveloping the earth on all sides.”\r\n\r\n“The ball on which your imaginary gnat travels is suspended by a thread.\r\nBy what chain is the enormous ball of the earth hung?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“The earth is not suspended from the firmament by any celestial chain,\r\nnor does it rest upon any support, like a geographical globe on its\r\npedestal. According to an Indian legend the terrestrial globe is borne\r\nupon four bronze columns.”\r\n\r\n“And what do the four columns rest on, in their turn?”\r\n\r\n“They rest on four white elephants.”\r\n\r\n“And the white elephants?”\r\n\r\n“They rest on four monstrous turtles.”\r\n\r\n“And the turtles?”\r\n\r\n“Well, they swim in an ocean of milk.”\r\n\r\n“And the ocean of milk?”\r\n\r\n“The legend says nothing about that, and it is right to be silent. It\r\nwould have been better not to imagine all these various supports,\r\nresting one on another, to hold the earth up. Suppose a pedestal for the\r\nearth, then a second to uphold the first, then a third, fourth,\r\nthousandth, if you like; it is only postponing the question without\r\nanswering it, since finally, after having erected all the supports\r\nimaginable, one must ask what will the last one rest on. Perhaps you are\r\nthinking of the vault of the heavens, which might well sustain the\r\nearth; but know that this vault has no reality, that it is nothing but\r\nan appearance caused by the air. Besides, thousands of travelers have\r\ngone over the earth in every direction, and nowhere have they seen\r\neither a suspending chain or a pedestal of any kind. Everywhere they see\r\nonly what is to be seen here. The earth is isolated in space; it swims\r\nin a void without any support, just as do the moon and the sun.”\r\n\r\n“But, then, why doesn’t it fall?” persisted Jules.\r\n\r\n“To fall, my little friend, is to rush earthward as a stone does when\r\nraised in the hand and then left to itself. How can the large ball rush\r\nto the earth, when it is the whole earth? Is it possible for a thing to\r\nrush toward itself?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then! Besides, imagine this. All is the same around the\r\nterrestrial globe; properly speaking, there is no up or down, no right\r\nor left. We call _up_ the direction toward adjacent space, or toward the\r\nsky; but remember that there is sky also on the other side of the earth,\r\nthat there it is just the same as we see it here, and that this is true\r\nfor all parts of the earth’s surface. If it seemed to you quite simple\r\nthat the earth does not rush toward the sky which is above us, why\r\nshould you expect it to rush toward the opposite sky? To fall toward the\r\nopposite sky would be to rise, as the lark rises here, when with one\r\nstroke of the wing it takes its flight and soars above us.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LII\r\n\r\n                               THE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE earth is round, as proved by the following facts. When, in order to\r\nreach the town he is journeying toward, a traveler crosses a level plain\r\nwhere nothing intercepts his view, from a certain distance the highest\r\npoints of the town, the summits of towers and steeples, are seen first.\r\nFrom a lesser distance the spires of the steeples become entirely\r\nvisible, then the roofs of buildings themselves; so that the view\r\nembraces a great number of objects, beginning with the highest and\r\nending with the lowest, as the distance diminishes. The curvature of the\r\nground is the cause of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Earth]\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Paul took a pencil and traced on paper the picture that you see\r\nhere; then he continued:\r\n\r\n“To an observer at A the tower is quite invisible because the curvature\r\nof the ground hides the view. To the observer at B the upper half of the\r\ntower is visible, but the lower half is still hidden. Finally, when the\r\nobserver is at C he can see the whole tower. It would not be thus if the\r\nearth were flat. From any distance the whole of a tower would be\r\nvisible. Afar off, no doubt, it would be seen with less clearness than\r\nnear to, on account of the distance; but it could be seen more or less\r\nwell from top to bottom.”\r\n\r\nHere is another drawing of Uncle Paul’s, representing two spectators, A\r\nand B, who, placed at very different distances, nevertheless see the\r\ntower from top to bottom on a flat surface. He resumed his talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Tower]\r\n\r\n\r\n“On dry land it is rare to find a surface that in extent and regularity\r\nis adapted to the observation I have just told you about. Nearly always\r\nhills, ridges, or screens of verdure intercept the view and prevent\r\none’s seeing the gradual appearance, from summit to base, of the tower\r\nor steeple that one is approaching. On the sea no obstacle bars the view\r\nunless it be the convexity of the waters, which follow the general\r\ncurvature of the earth. It is, accordingly, there especially that it is\r\neasy to study the phenomena produced by the rounded form of the earth.\r\n\r\n“When a ship coming from the open sea approaches the coast, the first\r\npoints of the shore visible to those on board are the highest points,\r\nlike the crests of mountains. Later the tops of high towers come into\r\nsight; still later the edge of the shore itself. In the same way an\r\nobserver who witnesses from the shore the arrival of a vessel begins by\r\nperceiving the tops of the masts, then the topsails, then the sails next\r\nbelow, and finally the hull of the vessel. If the vessel were departing\r\nfrom the shore, the observer would see it gradually disappear and\r\napparently plunge under the water, all in inverse order; that is to say,\r\nthe hull would be first hidden from view, then the low sails, then the\r\nhigh ones, and finally the top of the mainmast, which would be the last\r\nto disappear. Four strokes of the pencil will make you understand it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: A Ship at Sea]\r\n\r\n\r\n“How large is the earth?” was the next question from Jules.\r\n\r\n“The earth is forty million meters in circumference or 10,000 leagues,\r\nfor a league measures four kilometers. To encircle a round table, you\r\ntake hold of hands, three, four, or five of us. To encircle in the same\r\nmanner the vast bosom of the earth, it would take a chain of people\r\nabout equal to the whole population of France. A traveler able to walk\r\nday after day at the rate of ten leagues a day, which no one could do,\r\nwould take three years to girdle the globe, supposing it to be all land\r\nand no sea. But, where are the hamstrings that could resist three years\r\nof such continual fatigue, when a walk of ten leagues generally exhausts\r\nour strength and makes it impossible for us to begin again the next\r\nmorning?”\r\n\r\n“The longest walk I ever took was to the pine woods, where we went to\r\nlook for the nest of the processionary caterpillars, the day of the\r\nthunderstorm. How many leagues did we go?”\r\n\r\n“About four, two to go and two to come back.”\r\n\r\n“Only four leagues! All the same I was played out. At the end I could\r\nhardly put one foot before the other. It would take me, then, from seven\r\nto eight years to go round the world, walking every day as far as my\r\nstrength would let me.”\r\n\r\n“Your calculation is right.”\r\n\r\n“The earth then is a very large ball?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend, very large. Another example will help you to understand\r\nit. Let us represent the terrestrial globe by a ball of greater diameter\r\nthan a man’s height—by a ball two meters in diameter; then, in correct\r\nproportion, represent in relief on its surface some of the principal\r\nmountains. The highest mountain in the world is Gaurisankar, a part of\r\nthe Himalaya chain, in central Asia. Its peaks rise to a height of 8840\r\nmeters. Rarely are the clouds high enough to crown its crest, and its\r\nbase covers the extent of an empire. Alas! what does man become,\r\nmaterially, in face of such a prodigious colossus! Well, let us raise\r\nthe giant on our large ball representing the earth; do you know what\r\nwill be needed to represent it? A tiny little grain of sand which would\r\nbe lost between your fingers, a grain of sand that would stand out in\r\nrelief only a millimeter and a third! The gigantic mountain that\r\noverwhelmed us with its immensity is nothing when compared with the\r\nearth. The highest mountain in Europe, Mont Blanc, whose height is 4810\r\nmeters, would be represented by a grain of sand half as large as the\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n“When you told us of the roundness of the earth,” put in Claire, “I\r\nthought of the enormous mountains and deep valleys, and asked myself\r\nhow, with all these great irregularities, the earth could nevertheless\r\nbe round. I see now that these irregularities are a mere nothing in\r\ncomparison with the immensity of the terrestrial ball.”\r\n\r\n“An orange is round in spite of the wrinkles in its skin. It is the same\r\nwith the earth: it is round in spite of the irregularities of its\r\nsurface; it is an enormous ball sprinkled with grains of dust and sand\r\nproportioned to its size, and these are mountains.”\r\n\r\n“What a big ball!” exclaimed Emile.\r\n\r\n“To measure the circumference of the earth is not an easy thing, you may\r\nbe sure; and yet they have done more than that: they have weighed the\r\nimmense ball as if it were possible to put it in a scale-pan with\r\nkilograms for counterweights. Science, my dear children, has resources\r\ndemonstrating in all its grandeur the power of the human mind. The\r\nimmense ball has been weighed. How it was done cannot be explained to\r\nyou to-day. No scales were used, but it was accomplished by the power of\r\nthought with which God has endowed us, to solve, to His glory, the\r\nsublime enigma of the universe; by the force of reason, for which the\r\nburden of the earth is not too heavy. This burden is expressed by the\r\nfigure 6 followed by twenty-one zeros, or by 6 sextillions of\r\nkilograms.”\r\n\r\n“That number means nothing to me; it is too large,” Jules declared.\r\n\r\n“That is the trouble with all large numbers. Let us get around the\r\ndifficulty. Suppose the earth placed on a car and drawn on a surface\r\nlike that of our roads. For such a load, what should the team be? Let us\r\nput in front a million horses; and in front of that row a second\r\nmillion; then a third row, still of a million; a hundredth, finally a\r\nthousandth. We shall thus have a team of a thousand millions of horses,\r\nmore than could be fed in all the pastures of the world. And now start;\r\napply the whip. Nothing would move, my children; the power would be\r\ninsufficient. To start the colossal mass, it would need the united\r\nefforts of a hundred millions of such teams!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t grasp it any better,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“Nor I, it is so enormous,” assented his uncle.\r\n\r\n“Yes, enormous, Uncle.”\r\n\r\n“So that the mind gets lost in it,” said Claire.\r\n\r\n“That is what I wanted to make you acknowledge,” concluded Uncle Paul.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\n                             THE ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\n\r\n“IF you pass your hand quickly before your face, you feel a breath blow\r\non your cheeks. This breath is air. In repose it makes no impression on\r\nus; put in motion by the hand, it reveals its presence by a light shock\r\nthat produces an impression of freshness. But the shock from the air is\r\nnot always, like this, a simple caress. It can become very brutal. A\r\nviolent wind, which sometimes uproots trees and overthrows buildings, is\r\nstill air in motion, air that flows from one country to another like a\r\nstream of water. Air is invisible, because it is transparent and almost\r\ncolorless. But if it forms a very thick layer through which one can\r\nlook, its feeble coloring becomes perceptible. Seen in small quantities,\r\nwater appears equally colorless; seen in a deep layer, as in the sea, in\r\na lake, or in a river, it is blue or green. It is the same with air: in\r\nthin strata it seems deprived of color; in a layer several leagues in\r\nthickness, it is blue. A distant landscape appears to us bluish, because\r\nthe thick bed of intervening air imparts to it its own color.\r\n\r\n“Now air forms all around the earth an envelope fifteen leagues thick.\r\nIt is the aërial sea or atmosphere, in which the clouds swim. Its soft\r\nblue tint causes the sky’s color. It is in fact the atmosphere that\r\nproduces the appearance of a celestial vault.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, my children, what is the use of this aërial sea at the\r\nbottom of which we live as fish live in water?”\r\n\r\n“Not very well,” Jules replied.\r\n\r\n“Without this ocean of air life would be impossible, plant life as well\r\nas animal. Listen. Chief of those imperious needs to which we are\r\nsubjected are those of eating, drinking, and sleeping. As long as hunger\r\nis only its diminutive, appetite, that savory seasoning of the grossest\r\nviands; as long as thirst is only that nascent dryness of the mouth that\r\ngives so great a charm to a glass of cold water; as long as sleepiness\r\nis nothing more than that gentle lassitude that makes us desire the\r\nnight’s rest, so long is it the attraction of pleasure rather than the\r\nrude prick of pain that urges the satisfaction of these primordial\r\nneeds. But if their satisfaction is too long delayed, they impose\r\nthemselves as inexorable masters and command by torture. Who can think\r\nwithout terror of the agonies of hunger and thirst! Hunger! Ah! you do\r\nnot know what it is, my children, and God preserve you from ever knowing\r\nit! Hunger! If you could have any idea of its tortures, your heart would\r\nbe oppressed at the thought of the unhappy ones who experience it. Ah!\r\nmy dear children, always help those that are hungry; help them, and\r\ngive, give; you will never do a nobler deed in this world. Giving to the\r\npoor is lending to the Lord.”\r\n\r\nClaire had put her hand before her eyes to hide a tear of emotion. She\r\nhad observed a flash on her uncle’s face that spoke from the depth of\r\nhis heart. After a moment’s pause Uncle Paul continued:\r\n\r\n“There is, however, a need before which hunger and thirst, however\r\nviolent they may be, are mute; a need always springing up afresh and\r\nnever satisfied, which continually makes itself felt, awake or asleep,\r\nnight or day, every hour, every moment. It is the need of air. Air is so\r\nnecessary to life that it has not been given us to regulate its use, as\r\nwe do with eating and drinking, so as to guard us from the fatal\r\nconsequences that the slightest forgetfulness would cause. It is, as it\r\nwere, without consciousness or volition on our part that the air enters\r\nour body to perform its wonderful part. We live on air more than\r\nanything else; ordinary nourishment comes second. The need of food is\r\nonly felt at rather long intervals; the need of air is felt without\r\nceasing, always imperious, always inexorable.”\r\n\r\n“And yet, Uncle,” said Jules, “I have never thought of feeding myself\r\nwith air. It is the first time I ever heard that air is so necessary for\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“You have not given it a thought, because all that is done for you; but\r\ntry a moment to prevent air entering into your body: close the ways to\r\nit, the nose and mouth, and you will see!”\r\n\r\nJules did as his uncle told him, shut his mouth and pinched his nose\r\nwith his fingers. At the end of a moment, his face red and puffed up,\r\nthe little boy was obliged to put an end to his experiment.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible to keep it up, Uncle; it suffocates a person and makes\r\nhim feel as if he should certainly die if it kept on a little longer.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I hope you are convinced of the necessity of air in order to\r\nlive. All animals, from the tiniest mite, hardly visible, to the giants\r\nof creation, are in the same condition as you: on air, first of all,\r\ntheir life depends. Even those that live in the water, fish and others,\r\nare no exception to this rule. They can live only in water into which\r\nair infiltrates and dissolves. When you are older you shall see a\r\nstriking experiment which proves how indispensable to life is the\r\npresence of air. You put a bird under a glass dome, shut tight\r\neverywhere; then with a kind of pump the air is drawn out. As it is\r\nwithdrawn from the inside of the glass cage, the bird staggers,\r\nstruggles a moment in an anguish horrible to see, and falls dead.”\r\n\r\n“It must take a lot of air,” was Emile’s comment, “to supply the needs\r\nof all the people and animals in the world. There are so many!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed; a great quantity is needed. One man needs nearly 6000\r\nliters of air an hour. But the atmosphere is so vast that there is\r\nplenty of air for all. I will try to make you understand it.\r\n\r\n“Air is one of the most subtle of substances; a liter of it weighs only\r\none gram and three decigrams. That is very little: the same volume of\r\nwater weighs 1000 grams; that is to say, 769 times as much. However,\r\nsuch is the enormous extent of the atmosphere that the weight of all the\r\nair composing it outstrips your utmost powers of imagination. If it were\r\npossible to put all the air of the atmosphere into one of the pans of an\r\nimmense pair of scales, what weight do you think it would be necessary\r\nto put into the other pan to make it equal the air? Don’t be afraid of\r\nexaggerating; you can pile up thousands on thousands of kilograms; if\r\nair is very light, the aërial sea is very vast.”\r\n\r\n“Let us put on a few millions of kilograms,” suggested Claire.\r\n\r\n“That is a mere trifle,” her uncle replied.\r\n\r\n“Let us multiply it by ten, by a hundred.”\r\n\r\n“It is not enough, the pan would not be raised. But let me tell you the\r\nanswer, for in this calculation numerical terms would fail you. For the\r\ngreat weight I am supposing, the heaviest counterweights would be\r\ninsignificant. New ones must be invented. Imagine, then, a copper cube,\r\na kilometer in each dimension; this metallic die, measuring a quarter of\r\na league on its edge, shall be our unit of weight. It represents nine\r\nthousand millions of kilograms. Well, to balance the weight of the\r\natmosphere, it would be necessary to put into the other pan 585,000 of\r\nthese cubes!”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible!” Claire exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I told you so! Imagination vainly seeks to picture the stupendous mass\r\nof the layer of air wound like a scarf by the Creator around the earth.\r\nNow do you know what relation it bears to the terrestrial globe—this\r\nocean of air having a weight represented by half a million of copper\r\ncubes a quarter of a league each way? Scarcely what the imperceptible\r\nvelvety down of a peach is to the peach itself. What, then, are we,\r\nmaterially, we poor beings of a day, who move about at the bottom of\r\nthis atmospheric sea! But how great we are through thought, which makes\r\ngame of weighing the atmosphere and the earth itself! In vain does the\r\nmaterial universe overwhelm us with its immensity; the mind is superior\r\nto it, because it alone knows itself, and it alone, by a sublime\r\nprivilege, has knowledge of its divine author.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\n                                THE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY in the morning Uncle Paul and his nephews climbed the neighboring\r\nhill to see the sunrise. It was still quite dark. The only persons they\r\nmet in passing through the village were the milkmaid, on her way to town\r\nwith her butter and milk, and the blacksmith hammering away at the\r\nred-hot iron on his anvil, while the glow from the forge illumined the\r\ndarkness of the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Sun]\r\n\r\n\r\nSheltered by a clump of juniper-trees, Paul and the three children await\r\nthe grand spectacle they have come to the top of the hill to see. In the\r\neast the sky is getting lighter, the stars turn pale and go out one by\r\none. Flakes of rosy cloud swim in a brilliant streak of light whence\r\ngradually there rises a soft illumination. It reaches the zenith, and\r\nthe blue of day reappears with all its delicate transparency. This cool\r\nmorning light, this half-daylight that precedes the rising of the sun,\r\nis the aurora or morning twilight. In the meantime a lark, the joy of\r\nthe fields, takes wing to the highest clouds, like a rocket, and is the\r\nfirst to salute the awakening day. It mounts and mounts, always singing,\r\nas if to get in front of the sun; and with its enthusiastic songs it\r\ncelebrates in the high heavens the glory of the day-bringer. Listen:\r\nthere is a breath of wind in the foliage, which stirs and rustles; the\r\nlittle birds are waking up and chirping; the ox, already led to work in\r\nthe fields, stops as if thinking, raises its large eyes full of\r\ngentleness, and lows; everything becomes animated, and, in its own\r\nlanguage, renders thanks to the Master of all things, who with His\r\npowerful hand brings us back the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is: a bright thread of light bursts forth, and the tops of\r\nthe mountains are suddenly illumined. It is the edge of the sun\r\nbeginning to rise. The earth trembles before the radiant apparition. The\r\nshining disc keeps rising: there it is almost whole, now completely so,\r\nlike a grindstone of red-hot iron. The mist of the morning moderates its\r\nglare and allows one to look it in the face; but soon no one could\r\nendure its dazzling splendor. In the meantime its rays inundate the\r\nplain; a gentle heat succeeds the keen freshness of the night; the mists\r\nrise from the depths of the valleys and are dissipated; the dew,\r\ngathered on the leaves, becomes warm and evaporates; on all sides there\r\nis a resumption of life, of the animation suspended during the night.\r\nAnd all day, pursuing its course from east to west, the sun moves on,\r\nflooding the earth with light and heat, ripening the yellow harvest,\r\ngiving perfume to the flowers, taste to fruit, life to every creature.\r\n\r\nThen Uncle Paul, in the shade of the juniper-trees, began his talk.\r\n\r\n“What is the sun? Is it large, is it very far away? That, my children,\r\nis what I should now like to teach you.\r\n\r\n“To measure the distance from one point to another, you know of only one\r\nmeans: that of laying off, as many times as it will go, the unit of\r\nlength, the meter, from one end to the other of the distance to be\r\nmeasured. But science has methods adapted to the measuring of distances\r\nthat one cannot travel in person; it tells us what must be done to find\r\nthe height of a tower or mountain, without going to the top, without\r\neven approaching the base. They are methods of the same kind as are\r\nemployed to calculate the distance that separates us from the sun. The\r\nresult of the astronomer’s calculations is that we are distant from the\r\nsun 38 millions of leagues of 4000 meters each. This distance is\r\nequivalent to 3800 times the circumference of the earth. I told you\r\nthat, to make the tour of the terrestrial globe, a man, a good walker,\r\ncapable of walking ten leagues a day, would take about three years. He\r\nwould need, then, nearly twelve thousand years to go from the earth to\r\nthe sun, supposing that the journey were possible. The longest human\r\nlife is incomparably too short for a journey of this length ever to be\r\naccomplished by one person; and a hundred generations of a hundred years\r\neach, succeeding one another on the journey and uniting their efforts,\r\nwould not even be enough.”\r\n\r\n“And a locomotive,” asked Jules, “how long would it take to get over\r\nthat distance?”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember how fast it goes?”\r\n\r\n“I saw it myself the day we took the trip with you. If one looks out,\r\nthe road seems to fly back so fast it frightens you and makes you\r\ndizzy.”\r\n\r\n“The locomotive that drew us went at the rate of about ten leagues an\r\nhour. Let us suppose a locomotive that never stops and that goes still\r\nfaster, or fifteen leagues an hour. Rushing at that speed, the engine\r\nwould go from one end of France to the other in less than a day; and\r\nyet, to cover the distance from the earth to the sun, it would take more\r\nthan three centuries. For such a journey, the fastest engine ever made\r\nby the hand of man is hardly more than a sluggish snail ambitious to\r\nmake the tour of the world.”\r\n\r\n“And I who thought, not long ago,” said Emile, “that by climbing to the\r\nroof and with the aid of a long reed I could touch the sun!”\r\n\r\n“To one who trusts to appearances the sun is only a dazzling disc, at\r\nthe most as large as a grindstone.”\r\n\r\n“That is what I said yesterday,” observed Jules. “But, as it is so far\r\naway, it might well be as large as a millstone.”\r\n\r\n“In the first place, the sun is not flat like a grindstone; it has, like\r\nthe earth, the shape of a ball. Furthermore, it is much larger than a\r\ngrindstone, or even than a millstone.\r\n\r\n“Objects seem to us small in proportion to their distance from us, until\r\nfinally they become invisible. A high mountain seen from afar seems only\r\na moderate-sized hill; the cross that surmounts a steeple, seen from\r\nbelow, looks very small despite its very large dimensions. It is the\r\nsame with the sun: it looks so small only because it is very far off;\r\nand as the distance is prodigious, its size must be excessive; if not,\r\ninstead of looking to us like a dazzling grindstone, it would cease to\r\nbe visible to us.\r\n\r\n“You found the terrestrial globe enormous; and, despite my comparisons,\r\nyour imagination, I am sure, has not been able to picture things\r\nproperly. How will it be with the sun, which is one million four hundred\r\nthousand times as large as the earth! If we suppose the sun hollow like\r\na spherical box, to fill it would take one million four hundred thousand\r\nballs the size of the earth.\r\n\r\n“Let us try another comparison. To fill the measure of capacity called\r\nthe liter, it takes about 10,000 grains of wheat. It would take, then,\r\n100,000 to fill 10 liters or one decaliter, and 1,400,000 to fill 14\r\ndecaliters. Well, suppose in one pile 14 decaliters of wheat, and beside\r\nit one solitary grain of wheat. For the respective sizes, this isolated\r\ngrain represents the earth; the pile of 14 decaliters represents the\r\nsun.”\r\n\r\n“How wrong we were!” Claire exclaimed. “This little shining disc, to\r\nwhich, for fear of exaggeration, we should have hesitated to assign the\r\ndimensions of a millwheel, is a globe so big that in comparison with its\r\ngigantic size the earth is as nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, God in heaven!” cried Jules.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend, you may well say, ‘God in heaven,’ for the mind is\r\nbewildered at the thought of this inconceivable mass. Say: God in\r\nheaven! how great You are, You who out of nothing have created the sun\r\nand the earth, and hold them both in the shadow of Your hand!\r\n\r\n“I have not finished, my dear children. One day, in speaking to you of\r\nlightning and thunder, I told you that light moves with excessive\r\nrapidity. In fact, to come to us from the sun, to cover the distance\r\nthat a locomotive at its highest speed would take three hundred years to\r\ncover, a ray of light needs only the half of a quarter of an hour, or\r\nabout eight minutes. Now listen to this. Astronomy teaches us that each\r\nstar, small as it may appear from here, is itself a sun comparable in\r\nsize to ours; it tells us that these suns, of which we with the naked\r\neye can perceive only a very small part, are so numerous that it is\r\nimpossible to count them; it tells us that their distance is so great\r\nthat, to come to us from the nearest star, light, which travels so fast,\r\nas I have just told you, takes nearly four years; to reach us from\r\nothers that are by no means the most distant it takes whole centuries.\r\nAfter that, if you can, estimate the distance that separates us from\r\nthose far-off suns; think also of their number and size. But no, do not\r\ntry: the intellect is overwhelmed by these immensities in which is\r\nrevealed all the majesty of God’s handiwork. Do not try, it would be in\r\nvain; but let arise from your heart the burst of admiration that you\r\ncannot suppress, and bless God, whose infinite power has scattered suns\r\nthrough the boundless regions of celestial space.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER LV\r\n\r\n                             DAY AND NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n“IT seems to me,” said Claire, “we have lost sight of the hearth that\r\nturns with its lighted firebrands around the lark.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, we are closer to it than ever. If the sun, which is\r\nthirty-eight millions of leagues from us, were to go around the earth\r\nevery day, do you know how far it would have to go in a minute? More\r\nthan 100,000 leagues. But this incomprehensible speed is nothing. The\r\nstars, as I have just told you, are so many suns, comparable to ours in\r\nvolume and brilliancy; only they are much farther away, and that is what\r\nmakes them appear so small. The nearest is about thirty thousand times\r\nas distant as the sun. Accordingly, in order to go around the earth in\r\ntwenty-four hours, as it appears to do, it would have to move at the\r\nrate of thirty thousand times 100,000 leagues a minute. And how would it\r\nbe with other stars a hundred times, a thousand times, a million times\r\nfarther away—stars which, despite their distance, would all have to\r\naccomplish their journey around the earth always in exactly twenty-four\r\nhours? And remember, furthermore, the prodigious size of the sun. You\r\nwant it, the giant, the colossus, beside which the earth is only a lump\r\nof clay, to circle at an impossible speed in infinite space, in order to\r\ngive light and heat to our planet; you want thousands and thousands of\r\nother suns, quite as large and immensely farther off—in a word, the\r\nstars—to accomplish also, with velocities increasing according to the\r\ndistance, a daily journey around this humble terrestrial globe! No! no!\r\nsuch an arrangement is contrary to reason; to allow it is to want to\r\nmake the firebrands, the hearth, the whole house, turn around a little\r\nbird on a spit.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is the earth that turns, and we turn with it,” Claire again\r\ninterposed. “In consequence of this movement the sun and stars seem to\r\nus to move in the opposite direction, like trees and houses when we are\r\non the train. Since the sun seems to go around the earth from east to\r\nwest in twenty-four hours, it is a proof that the earth turns on its\r\naxis from west to east in twenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\n“The earth turns in front of the sun in a manner to present its\r\ndifferent parts successively to the rays of that body; it pirouettes on\r\nits axis like a top. Moreover, while it thus rotates in twenty-four\r\nhours, it revolves around the sun in the interval of a year. In playing\r\nwith a top you find a good example of two analogous movements executed\r\ntogether. When the top turns on its point, not moving from the same\r\nplace—in short, when it sleeps—it has only the movement of rotation. But\r\nin throwing it in a certain way, you know better than I that it circles\r\non the ground while turning on its point. In that instance, it\r\nrepresents in a small way the double movement of the earth. Its rotation\r\non its point represents the whirling motion of the earth on its axis;\r\nits course on the ground represents the earth’s revolution around the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n“You can familiarize yourself in another way with the double movement of\r\nthe terrestrial globe, as follows: place in the middle of a room a round\r\ntable, and on that table a lighted candle to represent the sun. Then\r\ncircle around the table, pirouetting on your toes. Each of your\r\npirouettes corresponds to a turn of the earth on its axis, and your\r\ncourse around the table corresponds to its journey around the sun.\r\nNotice that in turning on your toes you present in succession to the\r\nrays of the candle the front, one side, the back, and the other side of\r\nyour head, which in our experiment may represent the terrestrial globe;\r\nso that each one of its parts is in turn in the light or in the shade.\r\nThe earth does the same: in turning it presents one after the other its\r\ndifferent regions to the rays of the sun. It is day for the region that\r\nsees the sun, night for the opposite region. That is the very simple\r\ncause of day and night. In twenty-four hours the earth makes one\r\nrotation on its axis. Of these twenty-four hours the duration of the day\r\nand night is composed.”\r\n\r\n“I understand very well the cause of the alternation of day and night,”\r\nsaid Jules. “It is day for the half of the earth that sees the sun,\r\nnight for the opposite half. But as the globe turns, each country comes\r\nin succession to face the sun while others pass into the unlighted half.\r\nThe lark that turns on the hearth presents, in the same way, each of its\r\nsides in turn to the heat of the flame.”\r\n\r\n“One might almost say,” remarked Emile, “it is day for the half of the\r\nlark next to the fire, and night for the other half.”\r\n\r\n“One difficulty still perplexes me,” Jules continued. “If the earth\r\nturns around once in every twenty-four hours, in half of that time we\r\nought to make a half-turn with the globe that carries us, and find\r\nourselves upside-down. At this moment we have our heads up, feet down;\r\ntwelve hours later it will be just the opposite: our heads will be down\r\nand our feet up. We are upright, we shall be upside-down. In that\r\ninconvenient position why don’t we feel uncomfortable? Why are we not\r\nthrown down? So as not to fall, it seems to me, we ought to be obliged\r\nto cling to the ground in desperation.”\r\n\r\n“Your observation is right,” returned Uncle Paul, “but only in a certain\r\ndegree. Yes, it is true that twelve hours from now we shall be in an\r\ninverse position; our heads will be toward that point in space to which\r\nour feet are now turned. But despite this inversion there will be no\r\ndanger of our falling, nor even the slightest inconvenience of any kind;\r\nfor our heads will always be up, that is to say toward the sky, since\r\nthe sky surrounds the terrestrial globe everywhere; our feet will always\r\nbe down, that is to say resting on the ground. Understand thoroughly,\r\nonce for all, that to fall is to rush toward the ground, and not into\r\nsurrounding space. So that notwithstanding all the evolutions of our\r\nglobe, as we are always on the earth, feet on the ground, head toward\r\nthe sky, we are always in an upright position, without any unpleasant\r\nfeeling, without any danger of falling.”\r\n\r\n“Does the terrestrial globe turn very fast?” Emile inquired.\r\n\r\n“It turns on its axis once in twenty-four hours. Therefore any point in\r\nits middle region, the region that makes the longest journey, travels in\r\nthe same time forty millions of meters, that is to say a journey equal\r\nto the circuit of the earth, or 462 meters a second. That is about the\r\nspeed of a cannon-ball as it leaves the cannon’s mouth, or about thirty\r\ntimes the speed of the fastest locomotive. Mountains, plains, seas,\r\napparently fixed in their places for time and for eternity, are\r\nperpetually chasing one another in a circle, with the formidable speed\r\nof more than one-tenth of a league a second.”\r\n\r\n“And yet everything seems to us to be stationary.”\r\n\r\n“Without the jolting of the car should we not think we were standing\r\nstill when the train carries us with such frightful speed? Well, the\r\nrapid movement of the earth is at the same time so gentle that it is\r\nimpossible to be aware of it except by the apparent motion of the\r\nstars.”\r\n\r\n“By rising to a certain height in a balloon,” said Jules, “we ought to\r\nsee the earth turning under us. Seas and their islands, continents with\r\ntheir empires, forests, and mountains, ought in succession to come under\r\nthe eyes of the observer, who in twenty-four hours sees the turning of\r\nthe whole earth. What a magnificent spectacle that must be! What a\r\njourney, so wonderful and with so little fatigue! When the rotation\r\nbrings back one’s own country, one descends and it is accomplished. In\r\ntwenty-four hours, without changing place, one has seen the whole\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I agree with you, it would be an admirable way to see countries.\r\nTo this spot where we are other peoples will come, brought by the\r\nrotation; seas, distant regions, snowy mountains will take our place;\r\nand to-morrow at the same hour we shall be here again. Where we are\r\ntalking now, in the shade of the juniper-trees, first will pass the sea,\r\nthe somber Atlantic, which will replace our conversation by the grand\r\nvoice of its waves. In less than an hour the ocean will be here. Some\r\nlarge war-vessel, with its triple row of guns, will float perhaps, all\r\nsails set, over the spot we are occupying. The sea has passed. Now we\r\nhave North America, the great Canadian lakes, and the interminable\r\nprairies where the red-skinned Indians hunt buffaloes. The sea begins\r\nagain, much larger than the Atlantic; it takes nearly seven hours to\r\npass. What line of islands is this where fishermen wrapped in furs are\r\ndrying herrings? They are the Koorile Isles, south of Kamchatka. They\r\npass quickly; we scarcely have time to give them a glance. Now it is the\r\nturn of the yellow-faces—the Mongolians and Chinese, with slanting eyes.\r\nOh! what curious things we could see here! But the ball is always\r\nturning, and China is already in the distance. The sandy plateaus of\r\nCentral Asia and mountains higher than the clouds come next. Here are\r\nthe pastures of the Tartars, with neighing herds of mares; here are the\r\ngrassy plains of the Caspian with the flat-nosed Cossacks; then southern\r\nRussia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and finally France. Let us\r\ndescend quickly, get on to our feet; the earth has finished its\r\nrotation.\r\n\r\n“Do not for an instant, my little friends, think that this giddy\r\nspectacle of the earth passing with the rapidity of a cannon-ball would\r\nbe visible to any but spiritual eyes. By rising into the upper air in a\r\nballoon, as Jules said, it does at first seem as if we ought to see the\r\nearth turning and lands and seas passing under our feet. Nothing of the\r\nkind takes place, for the atmosphere turns with the terrestrial globe\r\nand drags the balloon in the general rotation, instead of leaving it at\r\nrest, as would be necessary if the observer were to have successively\r\nunder his eyes the different regions of the earth.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\n                        THE YEAR AND ITS SEASONS\r\n\r\n\r\n“YOU told us,” said Claire, “that at the same time the earth turns on\r\nits axis it travels round the sun.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. It takes three hundred and sixty-five days for that journey; it\r\nmakes three hundred and sixty-five pirouettes on its axis in\r\naccomplishing a journey round the sun. The time spent in this journey\r\nmakes just a year.”\r\n\r\n“The earth takes one day of twenty-four hours to turn on its axis; one\r\nyear to turn round the sun,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“That is it. Imagine yourself turning around a circular table the center\r\nof which is occupied by a lamp representing the sun, while you represent\r\nthe earth. Each of your walks around the table is one year. To represent\r\nthings exactly, you must turn on your heels three hundred and sixty-five\r\ntimes while you circle the table once.”\r\n\r\n“It is as if the earth waltzed around the sun,” Emile suggested.\r\n\r\n“The comparison is not so well chosen as it might be, but it is exact.\r\nIt shows that in spite of the giddiness of his age Emile has understood\r\nperfectly. A year is divided into twelve months which are: January,\r\nFebruary, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October,\r\nNovember, December. The unequal length of the months is sometimes\r\nconfusing. Some have 31 days, others 30; February has 28 or 29,\r\naccording to the year.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Claire, “I should find it hard to tell whether May,\r\nSeptember, and other months have 30 or 31 days. How can one remember\r\nwhich months have 31 days and which 30?”\r\n\r\n“A natural calendar, engraved on our hands, teaches us in a very simple\r\nway. Close the fist of the left hand. At the knuckles the four fingers,\r\nother than the thumb, from each a bump, separated by a hollow from the\r\nnext bump. Place the index finger of the right hand in turn on these\r\nbumps and hollows, beginning with the little finger, and at the same\r\ntime name the months of the year in order: January, February, March,\r\netc. When the series of the four fingers is exhausted, return to the\r\nstarting-point and continue naming the twelve months on the bumps and\r\nhollows. Well, all the months corresponding to the bumps have 31 days;\r\nall those corresponding to the hollows, 30. You must except February,\r\nanswering to the first hollow. That has 28 or 29 days, according to the\r\nyear.”\r\n\r\n“Let me try,” proposed Claire. “We’ll see how many days May has:\r\nJanuary, bump; February, hollow; March, bump; April, hollow; May, bump.\r\nMay has 31 days.”\r\n\r\n“It is as easy as that,” said her uncle.\r\n\r\n“My turn now,” interposed Jules. “Let us try September: January, bump;\r\nFebruary, hollow; March, bump; April, hollow; May, bump; June, hollow;\r\nJuly, bump. And now? I am at the end of my hand.”\r\n\r\n“Now begin again and go on naming the months,” Uncle Paul instructed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“You go on at the same point where you began?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“All right. August, bump. There are two bumps in succession. There are\r\nthen two months together, July and August, that have 31 days?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I will begin again. August, bump; September, hollow. September has 30\r\ndays.”\r\n\r\n“Why has February sometimes 28 and sometimes 29 days?” asked Claire.\r\n\r\n“I must tell you that the earth does not take exactly 365 days to turn\r\naround the sun. It takes nearly six hours more. To make up these six\r\nhours that were disregarded at first in order to have a round number of\r\ndays in the year, they are reckoned in every four years, and the\r\nadditional day they make all together is added to February, which then\r\nbecomes 29 days long instead of 28.”\r\n\r\n“So, for three years running, February has 28 days, and the fourth year\r\nit has 29.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. Remember, too, that the years when February has 29 days are\r\ncalled leap years.”\r\n\r\n“And the seasons?” queried Jules.\r\n\r\n“For reasons that would be a little too difficult for you to understand\r\nyet, the annual journey of the earth around the sun causes the seasons\r\nand the unequal length of days and nights.\r\n\r\n“There are four seasons, of three months each: spring, summer, autumn,\r\nand winter. Spring is from about March 20th to June 21st; summer from\r\nJune 21st to September 22d; autumn from September 22d to December 21st;\r\nwinter from December 21st to March 20th.\r\n\r\n“On March 20th and September 22d the sun is visible 12 hours and\r\ninvisible 12 hours, from one end of the earth to the other. The 21st of\r\nJune is for us the time of the longest days and shortest nights; the sun\r\nis visible sixteen hours and invisible eight hours. Farther north the\r\nlength of the day increases and that of the night diminishes. There are\r\ncountries where the sun, an earlier riser than here, rises at two\r\no’clock in the morning and sets at ten o’clock at night; still others\r\nwhere the time of its rising and that of its setting are so close\r\ntogether that the sun has hardly sunk below the apparent edge of the sky\r\nbefore it appears again. Finally, at the very pole of the earth, that is\r\nto say at the point that remains stationary, like the end of the axle of\r\na wheel, while all the rest turns, one could witness the wonderful\r\nspectacle of a sun that does not set, that turns around the spectator\r\nfor six whole months, equally visible at midnight and midday. In those\r\ncountries there is no longer any night.\r\n\r\n“On the 21st of December we have a state of affairs just the reverse of\r\nthat observed in June. With us the sun rises at 8 o’clock in the\r\nmorning; at four in the afternoon it has already set. That is eight\r\nhours of day for sixteen of night. Farther north there are now nights of\r\n18, 20, 22 hours, and corresponding days of six, four, and two hours. In\r\nthe neighborhood of the pole, the sun does not even show itself, and\r\nthere is no longer any daylight; for six months there is the same\r\ndarkness in the middle of the day as at midnight.”\r\n\r\n“And do people live in that country of the pole, where the year is\r\ncomposed of a day lasting six months and a night of six months?” asked\r\nJules.\r\n\r\n“No, up to this time[2] man has not been able to reach the pole on\r\naccount of the horrible cold there; but there are countries more or less\r\nnear the pole which are inhabited. When winter comes, wine, beer, and\r\nother beverages turn into blocks of ice in their casks; a glass of water\r\nthrown into the air falls back in flakes of snow; the moisture of the\r\nbreath becomes needles of rime at the opening of the nostrils; the sea\r\nitself freezes to a great depth and thus increases the apparent extent\r\nof the dry land, which it resembles, having, like it, its fields of snow\r\nand mountains of ice. For whole months the sun does not show itself, and\r\nthere is no difference between day and night, or rather it is one long\r\nnight, the same at midday as at midnight. However, when the weather is\r\nfine darkness is not complete; the light of the moon and stars,\r\naugmented by the whiteness of the snow, produces a kind of semi-daylight\r\nsufficient for seeing. By this wan light, in sledges drawn in disorderly\r\nfashion by teams of dogs, the people of these dark regions hunt what\r\nscanty game there is. Fishing furnishes them more abundant food. Fish,\r\ndried, stored, half decayed, and rancid whale’s blubber are their\r\nhabitual food. For fuel for their hearths their dependence is, again, on\r\ntheir fishing, which supplies them with fish-bones and slices of\r\nblubber. Here, in short, wood is unknown; no tree, however hardy, can\r\nresist the rigors of winter. Willows, birches, dwarfed to insignificant\r\nunderbrush, venture as far as the southern extremities of Lapland, where\r\nthe cultivation of barley, the hardiest of cultivated plants ceases.\r\nBeyond this point all woody vegetation ceases; and during the summer\r\nthere are found only occasional tufts of grass and moss, hastily\r\nripening their seeds in the sheltered hollows of the rocks. Further on\r\nthe summer is too short for the snow and ice to melt completely; the\r\nground is never bare, and all vegetation is impossible.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  This was written before Peary’s and Amundsen’s achievements in polar\r\n  exploration.—_Translator._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A part of the moon’s surface]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, the doleful countries!” cried Emile. “One more question, Uncle. In\r\ntraveling around the sun does the earth go fast?”\r\n\r\n“It takes a year for the entire tour; but as it circles at an enormous\r\ndistance from the sun, a distance of 38 millions of leagues, it must\r\ntravel this wide circle with a speed beyond your power to conceive. This\r\nspeed is 27,000 leagues an hour. In the same time the fastest locomotive\r\ngoes about 15 leagues. Compare and judge.”\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed Jules, “the immense ball of which we have never been\r\nable to comprehend the frightful weight travels in the sky with such\r\nrapidity?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend; with a speed of twenty-seven thousand leagues an hour\r\nthe terrestrial ball goes rolling through space, without axle, without\r\nsupport, always on the ideal line that has been given it for its\r\nrace-track. Who caused it to move so rapidly that the very thought of it\r\nmakes you feel giddy? Let us bow the head, my children; it is the power\r\nof God.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\n                           BELLADONNA BERRIES\r\n\r\n\r\nBAD news was circulating from house to house in the village. Here is\r\nwhat they were saying:\r\n\r\nThat day they had put little Louis into his first trousers. They had\r\npockets and shiny buttons. In his new costume Louis was a little\r\nawkward, but much pleased. He admired the buttons that shone in the sun;\r\nhe kept turning his pockets inside out to see if there was room enough\r\nfor all his playthings. What made him the happiest was a tin watch,\r\nalways marking the same hour. His brother, Joseph, two years older, was\r\nalso much pleased. Now that Louis was dressed like him, nothing\r\nprevented his taking him to the woods, where there were birds’ nests and\r\nstrawberries. They owned in common a lamb whiter than snow, with a\r\npretty little bell at its neck. The two brothers were to take it to the\r\nmeadow. Some lunch was packed in a basket. They kissed their mother, who\r\nadvised them not to go far. “Take care of your brother,” said she to\r\nJoseph; “hold him by the hand and come back soon.” They started. Joseph\r\ncarried the basket, Louis led the lamb. From the door their mother\r\nwatched them going off, herself happy in their joy. Every now and then\r\nthe children turned to smile at her; then they disappeared at the turn\r\nof the path.\r\n\r\nThey reach the meadow. The lamb frolics on the grass; Joseph and Louis\r\nrun after butterflies in the midst of a clump of tall trees.\r\n\r\n“Oh, the beautiful cherries!” exclaimed Louis, suddenly; “see how big\r\nand black they are! Cherries, cherries! We are going to have a feast.\r\nLet us pick some to eat.”\r\n\r\nThere were, in fact, some large berries of a dark violet hue on low\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n“How small these cherry-trees are!” answered Joseph. “I have never seen\r\nany like them. We shan’t have to climb the tree for them, and you won’t\r\ntear your new trousers.”\r\n\r\nLouis picked one of the berries and put it into his mouth. It was\r\ninsipid and sweetish.\r\n\r\n“These cherries are not ripe,” says little Louis, spitting it out.\r\n\r\n“Take this one,” answers Joseph, giving him one that felt very soft. “It\r\nis ripe.”\r\n\r\nLouis tastes it and spits it out.\r\n\r\n“No, they are not at all good,” repeats the little boy.\r\n\r\n“Not good, not good?” says Joseph; “you will see.” He eats one, then\r\nanother, then another still, then a fourth, then a fifth. At the sixth\r\nhe is obliged to stop. Decidedly they were not good.\r\n\r\n“It is true, they are not very ripe. But let’s pick some, all the same.\r\nWe’ll let them ripen in the basket.”\r\n\r\nThey gathered a handful or two of these black berries, then began\r\nrunning after butterflies. The cherries were forgotten.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Simon, who was returning from the mill with his donkey,\r\nfound two little children seated at the foot of the hedge, crying aloud\r\nand clasping each other. At their feet a lamb was lying and bleating\r\nplaintively. And the younger was saying to the other: “Joseph, get up;\r\nwe will go home.” The elder tried to rise, but his legs, seized with a\r\nconvulsive trembling, could not support him. “Joseph, Joseph, speak to\r\nme,” said the poor little one; “speak to me.” And Joseph, his teeth\r\nchattering, looked at his brother with eyes so big they frightened him.\r\n“There is one more apple in the basket; would you like it? I will give\r\nyou all of it,” went on the little fellow, his cheeks bathed in tears.\r\nAnd the elder trembled and then became rigid, by fits and starts, and\r\nstared fixedly with eyes growing ever larger and larger.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Simon passed. He put the two children on the donkey,\r\ntook the basket, and, followed by the lamb, hastened to the village.\r\n\r\nWhen the unhappy mother saw Joseph, her dear Joseph, so well a few hours\r\nbefore, so rejoiced at taking his brother for a walk, and now\r\nunconscious, dying, it was a scene to melt the heart. “My God, my God!”\r\ncried she, crazed with grief, “take me and leave my son! Oh, my Joseph!\r\nOh, my poor Joseph!” And, covering him with kisses, she burst into cries\r\nof despair.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was summoned; the basket in which were still some of the\r\nblack berries mistaken for cherries explained to him the cause of the\r\nsad event. “Deadly nightshade, great God!” he exclaimed under his\r\nbreath. “Alas! It is too late.” Broken-hearted, he ordered a potion, the\r\nefficacy of which he could not count on, for the poison had made\r\nirreparable progress. And, in fact, an hour later, while the mother, on\r\nher knees at the foot of the bed, was praying and weeping, a little hand\r\nwas stretched out from under the coverings and placed all cold in hers.\r\nIt was the last good-by: Joseph was dead.\r\n\r\nThe next day they buried the poor little one. The whole village attended\r\nthe funeral. Emile and Jules returned from the cemetery so sad that for\r\nseveral days they did not think of asking their uncle the cause of this\r\nlamentable accident.\r\n\r\nSince then, in the house of mourning, little Louis stops playing every\r\nnow and then and begins to cry, despite his beautiful tin watch. He has\r\nbeen told that Joseph has gone far away and that he will come back some\r\nday. “Mother,” he says sometimes, “when will Joseph come back? I am\r\ntired of playing alone.” His mother kisses him and, covering her face\r\nwith a corner of her apron, sheds hot tears. “Don’t you love Joseph any\r\nmore, and is that why you cry when I speak of him?” asks the poor little\r\ninnocent. And his mother, overwhelmed, tries in vain to stifle her sobs.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\n                            POISONOUS PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE death of poor Joseph had spread consternation through the village.\r\nIf children left the house and went off into the fields, there was\r\nconstant anxiety until they returned. They might find poisonous plants\r\nthat would tempt them with their flowers or their berries, and poison\r\nthem. Many said, with reason, that the best way to prevent these\r\nterrible accidents was to know the dangerous plants and teach the\r\nchildren to beware of them. They went and found Maître Paul, whose great\r\nknowledge was appreciated by all, and asked him to teach them the\r\npoisonous plants of the neighborhood. So Sunday evening there was a\r\nnumerous gathering at Uncle Paul’s. Besides his two nephews and his\r\nniece, Jacques and Mother Ambroisine, there were Simon, who had come\r\nupon the two unfortunate children on his way home from the mill, Jean\r\nthe miller, André the plowman, Philippe the vine-dresser, Antoine,\r\nMathieu, and many others. The day before, Uncle Paul had taken a walk in\r\nthe country to gather the plants he was to talk about. A large bunch of\r\nthe principal poisonous plants, some in blossom, others with berries,\r\nwere in a pitcher of water on the table.\r\n\r\n“There are people, my friends,” he began, “who shut their eyes so as not\r\nto see danger, and think themselves safe because they wilfully ignore\r\nperil. There are others who inform themselves about what may be a menace\r\nto them, persuaded that one warned person may be worth two unwarned. You\r\nbelong to this latter class, and I congratulate you. Countless ills lie\r\nin wait for us; let us try to diminish their number by our vigilance,\r\ninstead of giving ourselves up to lazy carelessness. Now that a\r\nfrightful misfortune has overtaken one of our families, who does not\r\nrealize the extreme importance of our all knowing, so as to avoid them,\r\nthese terrible plants that claim victims every year? If this knowledge\r\nwere more extended, the poor little fellow whose loss we now lament\r\nwould still be his mother’s consolation. Ah! unfortunate child!”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Belladonna]\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Paul, whom thunder never caused even to knit his brows, had tears\r\nin his eyes and his voice trembled. The good Simon, who had seen the two\r\nchildren in each other’s arms under the hedge, felt more moved than the\r\nothers at this recollection. He pulled down the broad rim of his hat to\r\nhide the big tears that were rolling down his rough cheeks bronzed by\r\nthe sun. After a few moments of silence Uncle Paul continued:\r\n\r\n“The death of the unfortunate little boy was caused by belladonna. It is\r\na rather large weed with reddish bell-shaped flowers. The berries are\r\nround, purplish-black, and resemble cherries. The leaves are oval and\r\npointed at the end. The whole plant has a nauseous odor and a somber\r\nappearance, as if to announce the poison it conceals. The berries\r\nparticularly are dangerous because they may tempt children by their\r\nresemblance to cherries and their sweetish taste. Enlargement of the\r\npupil of the eye and a dull, fixed stare are the characteristics of\r\nbelladonna poisoning.”\r\n\r\nPaul took from the bouquet in the pitcher a sprig of belladonna, and\r\npassed it around in the audience so that each one could examine the\r\nplant closely.\r\n\r\n“What do you say that is called?” asked Jean.\r\n\r\n“Belladonna.”\r\n\r\n“Belladonna; good. I know that weed. I have often found it near the\r\nmill, in shady places. Who would believe those pretty cherries held such\r\na frightful poison.”\r\n\r\nHere André asked: “What does the word belladonna mean?”\r\n\r\n“It is an Italian word meaning fine lady. Formerly, it seems, ladies\r\nused the juice of this plant to keep their complexion white.”\r\n\r\n“That is a property that does not concern our brown skin. What concerns\r\nus is this confounded berry which may tempt our children.”\r\n\r\n“Are not our herds in danger when this weed grows in pastures?” Antoine\r\nnext inquired.\r\n\r\n“It is very seldom that animals touch poisonous plants; they avoid\r\nbrowsing what might harm them, warned by the odor, and above all by\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\n“This other plant with large leaves, whose flowers, red on the outside\r\nand spotted on the inside with white and purple, are arranged in a long\r\nand magnificent cluster almost as high as a man, is called digitalis.\r\nThe flowers have the form of long, tun-bellied bells, or rather of\r\nglove-fingers; therefore it is called by different names, all referring\r\nto this peculiarity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fox-glove]\r\n\r\n\r\n“If I am not mistaken,” said Jean, “it is what we call fox-glove. It is\r\ncommon on the edges of woods.”\r\n\r\n“We call it fox-glove on account of its resemblance to the thumb of a\r\nglove. For the same reason it has elsewhere the name of gloves of\r\nNotre-Dame, gloves of the Virgin, and finger-stall. The name digitalis,\r\nborrowed from the Latin, also refers to the finger-shaped flower.”\r\n\r\n“It is a great pity that fine plant is poisonous,” commented Simon; “it\r\nwould be a pleasure to see it in our gardens.”\r\n\r\n“It is, indeed, cultivated as an ornamental plant, but in gardens under\r\nstricter vigilance than ours. As for us, my friends, who hardly have\r\ntime to watch over flowers, we shall do well not to put digitalis within\r\nreach of children by introducing it in our gardens. The whole plant is\r\npoisonous. It has the singular property of slowing up the beating of the\r\nheart and finally stopping it. It is unnecessary to tell you that when\r\nthe heart no longer beats, all is over.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hemlock]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hemlock is still more dangerous. Its finely-divided leaves resemble\r\nthose of chervil and parsley. This resemblance has often occasioned\r\nfatal mistakes, all the easier, because the formidable plant grows in\r\nthe hedges of enclosures and even in our gardens. A plain enough\r\ncharacteristic, however, enables us to distinguish the poisonous weed\r\nfrom the two pot-herds that resemble it: that is the odor. Rub that tuft\r\nof hemlock in your hands, Simon, and smell.”\r\n\r\n“Ouf!” said Simon, “that smells very bad; parsley and chervil have not\r\nthat horrid odor. When one is warned, no mistake can be made, in my\r\nopinion.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, when one is warned; but those who are not take no account of the\r\nsmell and mistake hemlock for parsley or chervil. It is in order to be\r\nwarned that you are listening to me this evening.”\r\n\r\n“You are doing us a great service, Maître Paul,” said Jean, “by putting\r\nus on our guard against these dangerous plants. Every one at home ought\r\nto know what you have just taught us, so as not to gather a salad of\r\nhemlock instead of chervil.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arum]\r\n\r\n\r\n“There are two kinds of hemlock. One, called the great hemlock, is found\r\nin damp and uncultivated places. It is very like chervil. Its stems are\r\nmarked with black or reddish spots. The other, called the little\r\nhemlock, resembles parsley. It grows in cultivated fields, hedges, and\r\ngardens. Both have a nauseating odor.\r\n\r\n“Now here is a poisonous plant very easy to recognize. It is the arum,\r\nor, as it is commonly called, cuckoopint or calves’-foot. The arum is\r\ncommon in hedges. The leaves are very broad and shaped like a large\r\nlance-head. The blossom is shaped like a donkey’s ear. It is a large\r\nyellowish trumpet, from the bottom of which rises a fleshy rod that\r\nmight be taken for a little finger of butter. This strange flower is\r\nsucceeded by a bunch of berries as large as peas and of a splendid red\r\ncolor. The whole plant has an unbearable burning taste.”\r\n\r\n“Let me tell you, Maître Paul,” put in Mathieu, “what happened one day\r\nto my little Lucien. Coming home from school, he saw in the hedge those\r\nlarge flowers you are speaking of, like donkey’s ears; the fleshy rod in\r\nthe middle looked to him like something good to eat. You have just\r\ncompared it to a little finger of butter. The thoughtless creature was\r\ntaken with its looks. He bit into the deceitful finger of butter. What\r\nhad he done! In a moment his tongue began to burn as if he had bitten a\r\nred-hot coal. I saw him come home spitting and making faces. He won’t be\r\ntaken in again, you may be sure. Luckily he hadn’t swallowed the piece.\r\nThe next morning he was all right.”\r\n\r\n“A similar burning flavor is found in the white milk-like juice that\r\nruns from the euphorbia when cut. The euphorbia are plants of mean\r\nappearance, very common everywhere. Their flowers, small and yellowish,\r\ngrow in a head, the even branches of which radiate at the top of the\r\nstem. These plants are easily recognized by their white juice, their\r\nmilk, which runs in abundance from the cut stems. This juice is\r\ndangerous, even on the skin alone, if it is tender; its acrid, burning\r\ntaste is its sufficient characteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aconites]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The aconites, like digitalis, are fine plants which for their beauty\r\nhave been introduced in gardens, notwithstanding the violence of their\r\npoison. They are found in hilly countries. Their blossoms are blue or\r\nyellow, helmet-shaped, and grow in an elegant terminal bunch of the\r\nfinest effect. Their leaves, of a lustrous green, are cut out in\r\nradiating sprays. The aconites are very poisonous. The violence of their\r\npoison has given them the name of dog’s-bane and wolf’s-bane. History\r\ntells us that formerly arrow-heads and lance-heads were soaked in the\r\njuice of the aconites, to poison the wounds made in war and to make them\r\nmortal.\r\n\r\n“There is sometimes cultivated in our gardens a shrub with large shiny\r\nleaves, which do not fall in winter, and with black, oval berries as\r\nlarge as acorns. It is the cherry-bay. All its parts, leaves, flowers,\r\nand berries, have the odor of bitter almonds and peach kernels. The\r\nleaves of the cherry-bay are sometimes used to give their perfume to\r\ncream and milk products. They should be used only with great prudence,\r\nfor the cherry-bay is extremely poisonous. They even say one has only to\r\nremain some time in its shade to become indisposed from its exhalations\r\nof a bitter-almond odor.\r\n\r\n“In autumn there is seen in abundance, in damp fields, a large and\r\nbeautiful flower, rose or lilac in color, that rises from the ground\r\nalone, without stem or leaves. It is the colchicum, called also meadow\r\nsaffron, or _veillotte_, also _veilleuse_, because it blossoms on the\r\neve of the cold season. If you dig a little way down, you will find that\r\nthis flower starts from a rather large bulb, covered with a brown skin.\r\nColchicum is poisonous; so cows never touch it. Its bulb is still more\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\n“But we have talked enough about harmful plants for to-day. I should be\r\nafraid of befogging your memories were I to enter into more details.\r\nNext Sunday I will expect you again, my friends, and will talk to you\r\nabout mushrooms.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\n                              THE BLOSSOM\r\n\r\n\r\nYES, they had listened very attentively the day before when Uncle Paul\r\ntold them all about poisonous plants. Who would not listen to a talk on\r\nflowers? Jules and Claire, however, would have been glad to hear more.\r\nHow are the flowers made that their uncle showed them yesterday? What is\r\nto be seen inside them? Of what use are they to the plant? Under the big\r\nelder-tree in the garden their uncle talked to them as follows:\r\n\r\n“Let us begin with the blossoms of the digitalis, which I spoke of\r\nyesterday. Here is one. It has, as you see, almost the form of a\r\nglove-finger, or better, of a long pointed cap. Emile could put one on\r\nto his little finger; there would be plenty of room. It is purplish-red\r\nin color. Inside, it has spots of dark red encircled with white. The red\r\nglove-finger rises from the center of a circle of five little leaves.\r\nThese little leaves are also part of the flower. Together they form what\r\nis called the calyx. The rest, the red part, is called the corolla.\r\nRemember these words, which are new to you.”\r\n\r\n“The corolla is the colored part of the flower; the calyx is the circle\r\nof little leaves at the base of the corolla,” repeated Jules.\r\n\r\n“Most flowers have two envelopes like these, one within the other. The\r\nexterior, or calyx, is nearly always green; the interior, or corolla, is\r\nembellished with those magnificent tints that please us in so many\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mallow]\r\n\r\n\r\n“In the mallow, which you see here, the calyx consists of five little\r\ngreen leaves, and the corolla of five large pieces of lilac rose-color.\r\nEach of these pieces is called a petal. The petals, all together, make\r\nthe corolla.”\r\n\r\n“The corolla of the digitalis has only one piece or petal; that of the\r\nmallow has five,” remarked Claire.\r\n\r\n“It looks that way at first, but on examining closely you will find that\r\nthey both have five. I must tell you that in a great many flowers the\r\npetals unite as soon as they begin to form in the bud, and by their\r\nunion constitute a corolla which looks like only one piece. But very\r\noften the united petals separate a little at the edge of the flower, and\r\nby indentations more or less deep show how many are joined together.\r\n\r\n“Look at this tobacco blossom. The corolla forms a tun-bellied funnel,\r\napparently composed of only one piece. But the edge of the flower is cut\r\nout in five similar parts, which are the extremities of so many petals.\r\nThe tobacco blossom, then, has five petals, the same as the mallow;\r\nonly, these five petals, instead of being separate all their length, are\r\nwelded together in a sort of funnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Corollas with separate petals are called polypetalous corollas.”\r\n\r\n“Like that of the mallow,” suggested Claire.\r\n\r\n“And that of the pear, almond, and strawberry,” added Jules.\r\n\r\n“Jules forgets some very pretty ones: the pansy and violet,” said Emile.\r\n\r\n“Corollas with petals all joined together are called monopetalous\r\ncorollas,” continued Uncle Paul.\r\n\r\n“For example, digitalis and tobacco,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“And the bell-flowers, don’t forget them, the beautiful white\r\nbell-flowers that climb the hedges,” Emile added.\r\n\r\n“The five petals joined together are just as easily distinguishable in\r\nthis flower we have here, called snap-dragon.”\r\n\r\n“Why is it called snap-dragon?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“Because when it is pressed on both sides it opens its mouth like an\r\nanimal.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul made the flower yawn; under pressure of his fingers it opened\r\nand shut its mouth as if biting. Emile looked on in amazement.\r\n\r\n“In this mouth there are two lips, upper and lower. Well, the upper lip\r\nis split in two by a deep indentation, the sign of two petals, and the\r\nlower lip is split in three, indicating three petals. The corolla of the\r\nsnap-dragon, although apparently all in one piece, is therefore in\r\nreality composed of five petals welded together.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Snap-dragon]\r\n\r\n\r\n“There are, then,” said Claire, “five petals in the mallow, pear,\r\nalmond, digitalis, tobacco, and snap-dragon, with this difference, that\r\nthe five petals are separate in the mallow, pear, and almond, and welded\r\ntogether in the digitalis, snap-dragon, and tobacco.”\r\n\r\n“Five petals, either separate or united,” Uncle Paul went on, “are found\r\nin a great many other flowers.\r\n\r\n“Let us come back to the calyx. The little green leaves of which it is\r\ncomposed are called sepals. There are five in the different flowers we\r\nhave just examined, five in the mallow, five in tobacco, five in\r\ndigitalis, five in the snap-dragon. Like the petals, the parts of the\r\ncalyx, or sepals, sometimes remain separate, sometimes join together,\r\nbut generally leave some indentations showing their number.\r\n\r\n“The calyx having its parts distinct from one another is called a\r\npolysepalous calyx. That of the digitalis and of the snap-dragon is of\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\n“The calyx with sepals united is known as a monosepalous calyx. Such is\r\nthat of the tobacco blossom. By the five indentations at its edge one\r\ncan easily see that it is formed of five pieces joined together.”\r\n\r\n“The number five occurs again and again,” observed Claire.\r\n\r\n“A flower, my child, is beyond doubt a wonderful thing of beauty, but\r\nespecially is it a masterpiece of wise construction. Everything about it\r\nis calculated according to fixed rules, everything arranged by number\r\nand measure. One of the most frequent arrangements is in sets of five.\r\nThat is why we have just found five petals and five sepals in all the\r\nflowers examined this morning.\r\n\r\n“Another grouping that often occurs is that in threes. It is found in\r\nbulb flowers,—the tulip, lily, lily of the valley, etc. These flowers\r\nhave no green covering or calyx; they have only a corolla composed of\r\nsix petals, three in an inner circle, three in an outer.\r\n\r\n“The calyx and the corolla are the flower’s clothing, a double clothing\r\nhaving both the substantial material that guards from inclemency, and\r\nthe fine texture that charms the eye. The calyx, the outer garment, is\r\nof simple form, modest coloring, firm structure, suitable for\r\nwithstanding bad weather. It has to protect the flower not yet opened,\r\nto shield it from the sun, from cold, and wet. Examine the bud of a rose\r\nor mallow; see with what minute precision the five sepals of the calyx\r\nare united to cover the rest. Not the slightest drop of water could\r\npenetrate the interior, so carefully are their edges joined together.\r\nThere are flowers that close the calyx every evening as a safeguard\r\nagainst the cold.\r\n\r\n“The corolla or inner garment unites elegance of form and richness of\r\ntint with fineness of texture. It is to the flower what wedding garments\r\nare to us. That is what especially captivates our eye, so that we\r\ncommonly consider it the most essential part of the flower, while it is\r\nreally only a simple ornamental accessory.\r\n\r\n“Of the two garments, the calyx is the more necessary. Many flowers, of\r\nsevere taste, know how to dispense with the pleasing part, the corolla;\r\nbut they are very careful not to renounce the useful, the calyx, which,\r\nin its simplest form, is reduced to a tiny little leaf like a scale.\r\nFlowers without corolla remain unseen, and the plants that bear them\r\nseem to us to have no blossoms. It is a mistake: all trees and plants\r\nbloom.”\r\n\r\n“Even the willow, oak, poplar, pine, beech, wheat, and so many others\r\nwhose blossoms I have never seen?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Even the willow, oak, and all the others. Their blossoms are extremely\r\nnumerous, but, as they are very small and have no corolla, they escape\r\nthe inattentive eye. There is no exception: every plant has its\r\nblossom.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER LX\r\n\r\n                                 FRUIT\r\n\r\n\r\n“IT would be knowing a person very little only to be aware of his\r\nwearing a garment of a certain material, a coat of such and such a\r\ncloth. One does not know a flower any better when one knows that it is\r\nclothed with a calyx and a corolla. What is under this covering?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A flowering branch of the Gillyflower]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let us examine together this gillyflower. It has a calyx of four sepals\r\nand a corolla of four yellow petals. I take away these eight pieces.\r\nWhat is left now is the essential part; that is to say, the thing\r\nwithout which the flower could not fill its rôle and would be perfectly\r\nuseless. Let us go carefully over this remaining part. You will find it\r\nwell worth the trouble.\r\n\r\n“First, there are six little white rods, each one surmounted by a bag\r\nfull of yellow powder. These six pieces are called stamens. They are\r\nfound in all flowers in greater or less number. The gillyflower has six,\r\nfour longer ones arranged in pairs, and two shorter.\r\n\r\n“The double bag that surmounts the stamen is called an anther. The dust\r\ncontained in the anther is known as pollen. It is yellow in the\r\ngillyflower, lily, and most plants; ashy gray in the poppy.”\r\n\r\n“You have already told us,” Jules interposed, “how clouds of pollen,\r\nraised by the wind in the woods, are the cause of supposed showers of\r\nsulphur that frighten people so.”\r\n\r\n“I take away the six stamens. There remains a central body, swollen at\r\nthe bottom, narrow at the top, and surmounted by a kind of head wet with\r\na sticky moisture. In its entirety this central body takes the name of\r\npistil; the swelling at the bottom is called an ovary, and the sticky\r\nhead that terminates it is a stigma.”\r\n\r\n“What big names for such little things!” exclaimed Jules.\r\n\r\n“Little, yes; but of unparalleled importance. These little things, my\r\ndear friend, give us our daily bread; without the miraculous work of\r\nthese little things we should die of hunger.”\r\n\r\n“I will take care to remember their names, then.”\r\n\r\n“I, too,” chimed in Emile; “but you must go over them again, they are so\r\nhard to learn.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul began again. Jules and Emile repeated after him: stamen,\r\nanther and pollen; pistil, stigma and ovary.\r\n\r\n“With a penknife I divide the flower in two. The split ovary shows us\r\nwhat is inside.”\r\n\r\n“I see little seeds in regular rows in two compartments,” observed\r\nJules.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what those hardly visible seeds are?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet.”\r\n\r\n“They are the future seeds of the plant. The ovary, then, is the part of\r\nthe plant where the seeds form. At a certain time the flower withers;\r\nthe petals wilt and fall; the calyx does the same, or remains to play\r\nthe part of protector a while longer; the dried stamens break off; only\r\nthe ovary remains, growing larger, ripening, and finally becoming the\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n“Every fruit—the pear, apple, apricot, peach, walnut, cherry, melon,\r\nstrawberry, almond, chestnut—began by being a little swelling of the\r\npistil; all these excellent things that the plant furnishes us for food\r\nwere first ovaries.”\r\n\r\n“A pear began by being the ovary of a pear blossom?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my child; pears, apples, cherries, apricots, begin by being the\r\novaries of their respective flowers. I will show you an apricot in its\r\nblossom.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul took an apricot blossom, opened it with his penknife, and\r\nshowed the children what is here shown in the picture.\r\n\r\n“In the heart of the flower you see the pistil surrounded by numerous\r\nstamens. The head that terminates it at the top is the stigma; the\r\nswelling at the bottom is the ovary or future apricot.”\r\n\r\n“That little green thing would have been an apricot, full of sweet\r\njuice, that I like so much?” inquired Emile.\r\n\r\n“That little green thing would have become an apricot like those Emile\r\nis so fond of. Now would you like to see the ovary that gives us bread?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! All these things are very curious,” replied Jules.\r\n\r\n“Better than that, very important.”\r\n\r\nClaire gave her uncle a needle at his request; then with the delicate\r\npatience necessary for this operation he isolated one of the numerous\r\nflowers of which the whole forms the ear of wheat. The delicate little\r\nflower displayed clearly, on the point of the needle, the different\r\nparts composing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wheat]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The blessed plant that gives us bread has not time to think of its\r\ntoilet. It has such weighty things to attend to: it must feed the world!\r\nSo you see what quiet clothes it wears! Two poor scales serve it for\r\ncalyx and corolla. You can easily recognize three hanging stamens with\r\ntheir double sachets for anthers. The principal body of the flower is\r\nthe tun-bellied ovary, which, when ripe, will be a grain of wheat. It is\r\nsurmounted by the stigma, fashioned like a double plume of exquisite\r\ndelicacy. Salute it, my children: behold the modest little flower that\r\ngives life to us all!”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\n                                 POLLEN\r\n\r\n\r\n“IN a few days, even in a few hours, a flower withers. Pistils, stamens,\r\ncalyx, fade and die. Only one thing survives: the ovary, which will\r\nbecome fruit.\r\n\r\n“Now, in order to outlive the other parts of the flower and remain on\r\nits stem when all the rest dries up and falls, the ovary, at the moment\r\nwhen blossoming is at its greatest vigor, receives a supplement of\r\nstrength, I should almost say a new life. The magnificence of the\r\ncorolla, its sumptuous colorings, its perfumes, serve to celebrate the\r\nsolemn moment when this new vitality comes to the ovary. This great act\r\naccomplished, the flower has had its day.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grains of Pollen]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, it is the pollen, the yellow dust of the stamens, that gives this\r\nincrease of energy without which the nascent seeds would perish in the\r\novary, itself withered. It falls from the stamens on to the stigma,\r\nalways coated with a stickiness apt to hold it; and from the stigma, it\r\nmakes its mysterious action felt in the depths of the ovary. Animated\r\nwith new life, the nascent seeds develop rapidly, while the ovary swells\r\nso as to give them necessary room. The final result of this\r\nincomprehensible travail is the fruit, with its contents of seeds ready\r\nto germinate and produce new plants. Do not question me further about\r\nthese wonderful things concerning which even the keenest observer ceases\r\nto see clearly. God only, the wisest of beings, knows how a grain of\r\npollen can give birth to something that was not before, and can cause\r\nthe ovary to feel the stirring of the vital principle.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you now how we know that the falling of the pollen on to\r\nthe stigma is indispensable to the development of the ovary into fruit.\r\n\r\n“Most flowers have both stamens and pistils. All those we have just\r\nlooked at are in that class. But there are plants that have some flowers\r\nwith stamens and others with pistils. Sometimes the flowers with stamens\r\nonly and those with pistils only are found on the same plant; sometimes\r\nthey are found on separate plants.\r\n\r\n“Did I not fear to overcharge your memory, I would tell you that plants\r\nhaving flowers with stamens only and flowers with pistils only on the\r\nsame plant are called monœcious plants. This expression means ‘living in\r\none house.’ In a word, the flowers with stamens and those with pistils\r\nlive together in the same house, since they are found on the same plant.\r\nThe pumpkin, cucumber, melon, are monœcious plants.\r\n\r\n“Vegetables whose flowers with stamens and flowers with pistils are\r\nfound on different plants are termed diœcious; that is to say, plants\r\nwith a double house. By this is meant that the ovary and pollen are not\r\nfound in the same plant. The locust, date, and hemp are diœcious.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flowering branch of Locust Tree]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The locust is a tree of extreme southern France. Its fruit grows in\r\npods similar to those of the pea, but brown, very long, and plump. This\r\nfruit, in addition to seeds, has a sugary flesh. Supposing we took a\r\nnotion, if the climate permitted, to grow locust seeds in our garden.\r\nWhat locust tree must we plant? Evidently the tree with pistils, because\r\nit alone possesses the ovaries which become fruit. But that is not\r\nenough. Planted by itself, the locust tree with pistils will be able to\r\nblossom abundantly every year, without ever producing any fruit; for its\r\nflowers would fall without leaving a single ovary on the branches. What\r\nis wanting? The action of the pollen. Close to the locust with pistils\r\nlet us plant one with stamens. Now fructification proceeds as we wish.\r\nWind and insects carry the pollen from the stamens to the stigmas; the\r\ntorpid ovaries spring to life, and in time the locust pods grow and\r\nripen perfectly. With pollen, fruit; without pollen, no fruit. Are you\r\nconvinced, Jules?”\r\n\r\n“Without doubt, Uncle; only, unfortunately, we do not know the locust. I\r\nshould prefer a plant of our own region.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Date-palm]\r\n\r\n\r\n“I will tell you of one that will permit you to prove what I have told\r\nyou; but first of all let me mention a second example.\r\n\r\n“The date-tree, like the locust, is diœcious. Arabs cultivate it for its\r\nfruit,—dates, their chief food.”\r\n\r\n“Dates are those long fruits of a very sweet taste, preserved dry in\r\nboxes,” said Jules. “A Turk was selling some at the last fair. The\r\nkernel is long and split all along one side from one end to the other.”\r\n\r\n“That is it. In the country of the date-tree, a sandy country burnt by\r\nthe sun, spots of watered and fertile earth are rare. These spots are\r\ncalled oases. It is necessary to utilize them as much as possible. So\r\nthe Arabs plant only date-trees with pistils, the only ones that will\r\nproduce dates. But when they are in flower, the Arabs go long distances\r\nto seek bunches of flowers with stamens on wild date-trees, to shake the\r\ndust on the trees they have planted. Without this precaution there is no\r\nharvest.”\r\n\r\n“Uncle will tell us so much,” Emile interposed, “that I shall have as\r\nmuch regard for the pollen as I have for the ovary. Without it, I should\r\nnot have tasted the dates of the Turk who smoked such a long pipe;\r\nwithout it, no apricots and no cherries.”\r\n\r\n“In the garden there is a long pumpkin-vine that will soon blossom. I\r\nwill give it to you for the following experiment.\r\n\r\n“The pumpkin is monœcious; flowers with stamens and flowers with pistils\r\ninhabit the same house, the same plant. Before they are full-blown they\r\ncan easily be distinguished from each other. The flowers with pistils\r\nhave under the corolla a swelling almost as large as a nut. This\r\nswelling is the ovary, the future pumpkin. The blossoms with stamens\r\nhave not this swelling.\r\n\r\n“Cut off all the blossoms with stamens before they are full-blown, and\r\nleave those with pistils. For greater surety, wrap each one of these in\r\na piece of gauze before it is in full-bloom. The covering must be large\r\nenough to permit the flower to open. Do you know what will happen? Not\r\nbeing able to receive the pollen, since the flowers with stamens are cut\r\noff, and since, also, the gauze wrapping keeps out the insects from the\r\nneighboring gardens, the pistillate flowers will wither after\r\nlanguishing a while, and the plant will not produce any pumpkins.\r\n\r\n“Would you, on the contrary, like such and such blossoms, at your\r\nchoice, to produce pumpkins in spite of their gauze prison and the\r\nsuppression of the staminate blossoms? With the tip of your finger take\r\na little pollen from one of the blossoms you have cut off, and put the\r\nyellow dust on the stigma of a pistillate flower. Then replace the gauze\r\nwrapping. That is enough, the pumpkin will come.”\r\n\r\n“You will let us try that delightful experiment?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“I will, I give the pumpkin-vine over to you.”\r\n\r\n“I have some gauze,” volunteered Claire.\r\n\r\n“And I some string to tie it with,” added Emile.\r\n\r\n“Come along,” cried Jules.\r\n\r\nAnd, gay as larks, the three children ran to the garden to get\r\neverything ready for the experiment.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\n                             THE BUMBLE-BEE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE flowers with pollen were cut off, those with ovaries wrapped each in\r\na separate gauze-bag. Every morning they went and watched the\r\nblossoming. With pollen taken from the cut flowers they powdered the\r\nstigmas of four or five pistillate blossoms. And it happened just as\r\ntheir uncle had said. The ovaries whose stigmas had received the pollen\r\nbecame pumpkins, the others dried up without swelling. Now, during these\r\nexperiments, which were both a serious study and a joyful amusement,\r\nUncle Paul continued his account of the flower.\r\n\r\n“The pollen reaches the stigma in divers ways. Sometimes the stamens,\r\nwhich are longer, let it fall by its own weight on the shorter pistil.\r\nSometimes the wind, shaking the flower, deposits the dust of the stamens\r\non the stigma, or even carries it long distances for the benefit of\r\nother ovaries.\r\n\r\n“There are flowers whose stamens behave in such a manner as to fulfil\r\ntheir mission. They bend over alternately and apply their anthers to the\r\nstigma, there to deposit some pollen; then slowly raise themselves to\r\ngive place one to another. They might be regarded as a circle of\r\ncourtiers depositing their offerings at the feet of a great king. These\r\nsalutations at an end, the rôle of the stamens is finished. The flower\r\nfades, but the ovary begins to ripen its seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diœcious plants (male and female) of Vallisneria\r\nSpiralis]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The vallisneria is a plant that lives under the water. It is very\r\ncommon in the Southern Canal. Its leaves resemble narrow green ribbons.\r\nIt is diœcious, that is to say it has flowers with stamens and those\r\nwith pistils on different plants. The pistillate flowers are borne on\r\nlong, tightly curled stems. The blossoms with stamens have only very\r\nshort stems. Under water, where the current would carry away the pollen\r\nand prevent its fastening itself on the stigmas, the quickening action\r\nof the stamens on the pistil cannot take place. So the vallisneria,\r\nfixed by its roots in the mud, is obliged to send its flowers to the\r\nsurface of the water to let them blossom in the open air. It is easy for\r\nthe pistillate flowers. They unwind the curl that supports them, and\r\nmount to the surface. But what will the staminate flowers do, fastened\r\nas they are to the bottom with their short stems?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot undertake to say,” answered Jules.\r\n\r\n“Well, by their own strength, without any external aid, these flowers\r\npull away from their stems, break their moorings, and mount to the\r\nsurface to rejoin the pistillate flowers. Then they open their little\r\nwhite corollas and free their pollen to wind and insects, which deposit\r\nit on the stigmas. After that they die and the current carries them\r\naway, while the flowers quickened by the pollen curl up again and\r\ndescend once more beneath the water, there to ripen their ovaries at\r\nleisure.”\r\n\r\n“It is wonderful, Uncle; one would say those little flowers know what\r\nthey are doing.”\r\n\r\n“They do not know what they are doing; they obey mechanically the laws\r\nof Providence, which makes sport of difficulties and knows how to\r\naccomplish miracles in a simple blade of grass. Would you like another\r\nstriking example of this infinite wisdom that foresees everything,\r\narranges everything? Let us come back to the snap-dragon.\r\n\r\n“Insects are the flower’s auxiliaries. Flies, wasps, honey-bees,\r\nbumble-bees, beetles, butterflies, all vie with one another in rendering\r\naid by carrying the pollen of the stamens to the stigmas. They dive into\r\nthe flower, enticed by a honeyed drop expressly prepared at the bottom\r\nof the corolla. In their efforts to obtain it they shake the stamens and\r\ndaub themselves with pollen, which they carry from one flower to\r\nanother. Who has not seen bumble-bees coming out of the bosom of the\r\nflowers all covered with pollen? Their hairy stomachs, powdered with\r\npollen, have only to touch a stigma in passing to communicate life to\r\nit. When in the spring you see on a blooming pear-tree, a whole swarm of\r\nflies, bees, and butterflies, hurrying, humming, and fluttering, it is a\r\ntriple feast, my friends: a feast for the insect that pilfers in the\r\ndepth of the flowers; a feast for the tree whose ovaries are quickened\r\nby all these merry little people; and a feast for man, to whom abundant\r\nharvest is promised. The insect is the best distributor of pollen. All\r\nthe flowers it visits receive their share of quickening dust.”\r\n\r\n“It is in order to prevent the insects coming from neighboring gardens\r\nand bringing pollen that you have had the pumpkin blossoms covered with\r\nbags of gauze?” inquired Emile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my child. Without this precaution the pumpkin experiment would\r\ncertainly not succeed; for insects come from a distance, very far\r\nperhaps, and deposit on our flowers the pollen gathered from other\r\npumpkins. And very little of it is necessary; a few grains are enough to\r\ngive life to an ovary.\r\n\r\n“To attract the insect that it needs, every flower has at the bottom of\r\nits corolla a drop of sweet liquor called nectar. From this liquor bees\r\nmake their honey. To draw it from corollas shaped like a deep funnel,\r\nbutterflies have a long trumpet, curled in a spiral when at rest, but\r\nwhich they unroll and plunge into the flower like a bore when they wish\r\nto obtain the delicious drink. The insect does not see this drop of\r\nnectar; however, it knows that it is there and finds it without\r\nhesitation. But in some flowers a grave difficulty presents itself:\r\nthese flowers are closed tight everywhere. How is the treasure to be got\r\nat, how find the entrance that leads to the nectar? Well, these closed\r\nflowers have a signboard, a mark that says clearly: Enter here.”\r\n\r\n“You won’t make us believe that!” cried Claire.\r\n\r\n“I am not going to make you believe anything, my dear child; I am going\r\nto show you. Look at this snap-dragon blossom. It is shut tight, its two\r\nclosed lips leave no passage between. Its color is a uniform purplish\r\nred; but there, just in the middle of the lower lip, is a large spot of\r\nbright yellow. This spot, so appropriate for catching the eye, is the\r\nmark, the signboard I told you of. By its brightness it says: Here is\r\nthe keyhole.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bumble-Bee]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Press your little finger on the spot. You see. The flower yawns\r\nimmediately, the secret lock works. And you think the bumble-bee does\r\nnot know these things? Watch it in the garden and you will see how it\r\ncan read the signs of the flowers. When it visits a snap-dragon, it\r\nalways alights on the yellow spot and nowhere else. The door opens, it\r\nenters. It twists and turns in the corolla and covers itself with\r\npollen, with which it daubs the stigma. Having drunk the drop, it goes\r\noff to other flowers, forcing the opening of which it knows the secret\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\n“All closed flowers have, like the snap-dragon, a conspicuous point, a\r\nspot of bright color, a sign that shows the insect the entrance to the\r\ncorolla and says to it: Here it is. Finally, insects whose trade it is\r\nto visit flowers and make the pollen fall from the stamens on to the\r\nstigma, have a wonderful knowledge of the significance of this spot. It\r\nis on it they use their strength to make the flower open.\r\n\r\n“Let us recapitulate. Insects are necessary to flowers to bring pollen\r\nto the stigmas. A drop of nectar, distilled on purpose for this,\r\nattracts them to the bottom of the corolla; a bright spot shows them the\r\nroad to follow. Either I am a triple idiot or we have here an admirable\r\nchain of facts. Later, my children, you will find only too many people\r\nsaying: This world is the product of chance, no intelligence rules it,\r\nno Providence guides it. To those people, my friends, show the\r\nsnap-dragon’s yellow spot. If, less clear-sighted than the burly\r\nbumble-bee, they do not understand it, pity them: they have diseased\r\nbrains.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXIII\r\n\r\n                               MUSHROOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nWHILE they were talking about insects and flowers, time had slipped by\r\nuntil the Sunday arrived when Uncle Paul was to tell about mushrooms.\r\nThe gathering was larger than the first time. The story of poisonous\r\nplants had been repeated in the village. Some people in a rut, content\r\nwith their stupid ignorance, had said: “What is the use of it?” “The\r\nuse!” replied the others; “it teaches one to beware of poisonous plants,\r\nso as not to die miserably like poor Joseph.” But those in the rut had\r\ntossed their heads with a satisfied air. Nothing is so sufficient unto\r\nitself as folly. So only willing listeners came to Uncle Paul.\r\n\r\n“Of all poisonous plants, my friends,” he began, “mushrooms are the most\r\nformidable; and yet some furnish a delightful food capable of tempting\r\nthe soberest.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” observed Simon, “I acknowledge, nothing is equal to a\r\ndish of mushrooms.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody will accuse you of gluttony, for, as I have just said, mushrooms\r\ncan tempt the soberest. I do not wish to discourage their use. I know\r\ntoo well what a resource they are in the country; I simply propose to\r\nput you on your guard against the poisonous kinds.”\r\n\r\n“You are going to teach us to distinguish the good from the bad?” asked\r\nMathieu.\r\n\r\n“No; that is impossible for us.”\r\n\r\n“How impossible? Everybody knows that you can eat without fear mushrooms\r\nthat grow at the foot of such and such a tree.”\r\n\r\n“Before answering that remark, I will address myself to you all and ask:\r\nHave you confidence in my word? Do you think that passing one’s life in\r\nstudying such things is more instructive than the hear-say of those who\r\ndo not concern themselves with these matters?”\r\n\r\n“You may speak, Maître Paul: we all have full confidence in your\r\nlearning,” Simon made answer for the company.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I repeat it in all conviction: it is impossible for us who\r\nare not specialists to distinguish an edible mushroom from a poisonous\r\none, for none has a mark to say: This is eatable and this is not.\r\nNeither the nature of the ground, nor the trees at the foot of which\r\nthey grow, nor their form, color, taste, smell, can teach us anything or\r\nenable us to distinguish at sight the harmless from the poisonous. I\r\nadmit that a person who had passed long years studying mushrooms with\r\nthe minute attention of a scientist would succeed in distinguishing\r\npretty well the poisonous from the harmless, just as one acquires a\r\nknowledge of any other plant; but can we undertake such studies? Have we\r\nthe time? We scarcely know a dozen weeds, and yet we would presume to\r\npass judgment on the properties of mushrooms, so many in kind and\r\nresembling one another so closely?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mushrooms]\r\n\r\n\r\n“I hasten to add that, in every locality, actual use has long since\r\ntaught the people some kinds that they can eat without danger. It is a\r\ngood thing to conform to this usage, which makes us profit by other\r\npeople’s experience—on condition, be it understood, that we acquaint\r\nourselves with the kinds used. But that is not enough to keep us safe\r\nfrom all peril. It is so easy to make a mistake! And then, go to another\r\nplace and you will come across other mushrooms which, while apparently\r\nof the same family as those you have known as eatable, will be\r\ndangerous. My rule of conduct is, you see, absolute: you must beware of\r\nall mushrooms; excess of prudence is necessary here.”\r\n\r\n“I admit with you,” said Simon, “that it is impossible for us to\r\ndistinguish at sight the eatable from the poisonous kinds; but there are\r\nways of deciding the question.”\r\n\r\n“Tell us how.”\r\n\r\n“In the autumn we cut mushrooms in slices and dry them in the sun. They\r\nare excellent food for winter. The poisonous mushrooms rot without\r\ndrying. The good ones keep.”\r\n\r\n“Wrong. All mushrooms, good or bad indifferently, keep or spoil\r\naccording to their more or less advanced state and according to the\r\nweather at the time of preparation. This characteristic is of no value\r\nwhatever.”\r\n\r\n“Worms attack good mushrooms,” Antoine here interposed; “they do not\r\nattack bad ones, because they poison them.”\r\n\r\n“That characteristic is no better than the other one. Worms attack all\r\nold mushrooms, bad as well as good; for what would be death to us is\r\nharmless to them. Their stomach is made so that they can eat poison with\r\nimpunity. Certain insects eat aconite, digitalis, belladonna; they feast\r\non what would kill us.”\r\n\r\n“They say,” remarked Jean, “that a piece of silver put in the pot when\r\nthe mushrooms are cooking turns black if they are poisonous, and remains\r\nwhite if they are good.”\r\n\r\n“The saying is a foolish one, and to put it in practice a folly. Silver\r\ndoes not change color any more from bad than from good mushrooms.”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to do, then, but give up mushrooms. That would be hard\r\non me,” said Simon.\r\n\r\n“No, no; I promise you, on the contrary, that you will be able to use\r\nthem more than you have done. The only thing is to proceed advisedly.\r\n\r\n“What is poisonous in mushrooms is not the flesh, but the juice with\r\nwhich it is impregnated. Get rid of that juice, and the injurious\r\nproperties will disappear immediately. This is accomplished by slicing\r\nand cooking the mushrooms, either dried or fresh, in boiling water with\r\na handful of salt. They are then drained in a colander and washed two or\r\nthree times in cold water. That done, they are prepared in any way one\r\nchooses.\r\n\r\n“If, on the contrary, mushrooms are prepared without having first been\r\ncooked in boiling water, we expose ourselves to the danger of a\r\npoisonous juice.\r\n\r\n“The cooking in boiling water to which salt has been added is so\r\nefficacious that, in order to solve this serious problem, certain\r\npersons have had the courage to eat for whole months the most poisonous\r\nmushrooms, prepared, however, in the way I have just told you.”\r\n\r\n“And what happened to them?” asked Simon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Poisonous Mushroom]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Nothing at all. It is true that these persons prepared their poisonous\r\nmushrooms with the most scrupulous care.”\r\n\r\n“There was reason for it. According to you, then, one could use all\r\nmushrooms without distinction?”\r\n\r\n“Strictly speaking, yes. But that would be going too far, much too far.\r\nThere would be the fear of incomplete preparation, insufficient cooking.\r\nI only affirm that you must submit mushrooms of good repute in the\r\nneighborhood to the preliminary cooking in boiling water. If, by chance,\r\nsome poisonous ones were included, the poison would in this way be\r\neliminated and no accident would happen; I would bet my hand on that.”\r\n\r\n“What you have just taught us, Maître Paul, will be profited by, you may\r\nbe sure. Are we ever quite certain that there is nothing poisonous in\r\nwhat we gather?”\r\n\r\nBefore saying good-by Simon approached Mother Ambroisine and entered\r\nwith her into more circumstantial details of the cooking. He is so fond\r\nof mushrooms, the worthy man!\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXIV\r\n\r\n                              IN THE WOODS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE history of mushrooms reduced to a rule for cooking which will save\r\nus from grave dangers was enough for Simon, Mathieu, Jean, and the\r\nothers, who lacked time to hear more; but Emile, Jules, and Claire were\r\nnot satisfied: they wished to extend their knowledge on these strange\r\nvegetables. So their uncle took them one day to a beech wood near the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThe trees, several hundred years old and with their branches meeting at\r\na great height, formed an arch of foliage through which, here and there,\r\nshone a ray of sunlight. Their smooth trunks, with white bark, gave the\r\neffect of enormous columns sustaining the weight of an immense building\r\nfull of shade and silence. On the lofty summits crows cawed while\r\nsmoothing their feathers. Occasionally a redheaded green woodpecker,\r\nsurprised at its work, which consists of pecking the wormy wood with its\r\nbeak to make the insects come out that it feeds on, gave a cry of alarm\r\nand flew off like a dart. In the midst of the moss with which the ground\r\nwas carpeted were here and there numbers of mushrooms. Some were round,\r\nsmooth, and white. Jules could not admire them enough; he likened them\r\nin his imagination to eggs laid in a mossy hollow by some wandering hen.\r\nOthers were glossy red, others bright fawn-color, and still others\r\nbrilliant yellow. Some, just coming out of the ground, were enveloped in\r\na kind of bag that tears open as the mushroom grows; some, more\r\nadvanced, spread out like an open umbrella. Finally, there were many\r\nthat had already begun to decay. In their fetid rottenness swarmed\r\ninnumerable grubs, which later would become insects. After picking a\r\nnumber of the principal kinds, the party sat down at the foot of a\r\nbeech, on the soft moss-carpet, and Uncle Paul spoke thus:\r\n\r\n“A mushroom is the blossom of a plant that lives under ground and is\r\ncalled by learned men _mycelium_. This subterranean plant is composed of\r\nwhite, slender, fragile threads, resembling in their entirety a large\r\ncobweb. If you pull up a mushroom carefully you will see at the base of\r\nits stalk, in the earth that clings to it, numerous white threads of the\r\nmycelium. Let us imagine a rosebush planted so as to leave nothing but\r\nthe roses above ground. The buried bush will represent the subterranean\r\nmycelium; the roses, open to the air, will represent the blossoms of the\r\nmycelium, that is to say the mushrooms.”\r\n\r\n“A rosebush,” objected Jules, “has stout branches covered with leaves;\r\nthe mushroom-plant, according to what I see, has nothing of the sort. It\r\nis a kind of moldiness that branches out in the ground in white veins.”\r\n\r\n“Those white veins, so delicate that one can hardly touch them without\r\nbreaking them, form the subterranean plant, without leaves or roots.\r\nThey lengthen little by little in the ground to a pretty good distance\r\nfrom the point of departure. Then, at a favorable moment, they produce\r\nlittle swellings which grow under ground, become mushrooms, and burst\r\nopen their bed of earth to expand in the air. This structure explains to\r\nus why mushrooms grow in groups. Each group, with the mycelium that\r\nproduces it, constitutes one and the same plant.”\r\n\r\n“I have seen groups of mushrooms in a perfect circle,” Claire remarked.\r\n\r\n“If the ground is of uniform character and nowhere hinders the\r\npropagation of the subterranean vegetable in one direction rather than\r\nin another, the mycelium spreads equally on all sides, and so produces\r\ncircular groups of mushrooms, which the country people sometimes call\r\nwitches’ circles.”\r\n\r\n“Why witches’ circles?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“The ignorant and superstitious think they see an effect of witchcraft\r\nin this curious circular arrangement, whereas it is but the natural\r\nresult of the uniformly equal development of the subterranean plant.”\r\n\r\n“Then there are no witches?” said Emile.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear. There are rogues who abuse the credulity of others; there\r\nare simpletons disposed to listen to them; but no one has preternatural\r\npowers.”\r\n\r\n“Since a mushroom is the blossom of a subterranean plant, of the\r\nmycelium, as you call it, must it not have stamens, pistils, ovaries?”\r\nJules inquired.\r\n\r\n“A mushroom is in its way the blossom of a kind of vegetable, but its\r\nstructure has nothing in common with that of ordinary flowers. It is a\r\nstructure of a special sort, very complicated, very curious, which I\r\nshall pass by in silence so as not to overcharge your memory.\r\n\r\n“The chief function of a flower, you know, is to produce seeds. Well,\r\nthe mushroom too produces seeds, but so small, so different from others,\r\nthat they have a special name,—spores. Spores are the seed of the\r\nmushroom, just as acorns are the seed of the oak. That is worthy of some\r\nfurther explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mushrooms]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The mushrooms most familiar to us are composed of a sort of dome\r\nsupported by a stalk. This dome is called the cap. The under side of the\r\ncap takes various shapes, of which the principal are these: Sometimes it\r\nis composed of gills which radiate from the center to the border;\r\nsometimes it is pierced by an infinity of little holes, which are the\r\norifices of as many tubes joined together in a common mass; sometimes it\r\nis covered with fine points like those of a cat’s tongue.\r\n\r\n“Mushrooms that have the under side of the cap formed of radiating gills\r\nare called agarics; those pierced with little holes, boleti; those\r\ncovered with little points, hydnei. Agarics and boleti are the most\r\ncommon.”\r\n\r\nHere Uncle Paul took, one by one, the mushrooms they had gathered and\r\nshowed his nephews the gills of the agarics, the holes of the boleti,\r\nand the points of the hydnei.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXV\r\n\r\n                           THE ORANGE-AGARIC\r\n\r\n\r\n“MUSHROOM seeds, or spores, form on these gills, these points, and on\r\nthe walls of the tubes of which these holes are the orifices. I\r\nrecommend to Jules the following experiment. We will take some mushrooms\r\nwhose caps are not yet thoroughly spread. We will place them this\r\nevening on a sheet of white paper. During the night the blossoming will\r\nbe finished and the ripe seeds will fall from the gills of the agarics\r\nand the tubes of the boleti. To-morrow morning we shall find on the\r\npaper an impalpable dust, red, rose, brown, according to the kind of\r\nmushroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Binocular Microscope]\r\n\r\n\r\n“This dust is nothing but a mass of seeds, of spores, so fine that they\r\ncannot be seen separately without a microscope, so numerous they cannot\r\nbe counted. There are millions and millions of them.”\r\n\r\n“A microscope,” interrupted Emile. “Is that the instrument with which\r\nyou sometimes look at things so small that the naked eye can scarcely\r\nsee them?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. A microscope enlarges the objects seen through it, and shows them\r\nto us in all their details of structure, although they would be hidden\r\nfrom the unaided eye by their smallness.”\r\n\r\n“Will you show us through the microscope the mushroom spores when I have\r\ncollected them on a sheet of paper?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“I will show them to you. One spore is enough, under favorable\r\nconditions of heat and moisture, to germinate and develop into white\r\nfilaments or mycelium from which will spring at the right time numerous\r\nmushrooms. How many mushrooms would be produced if all the spores that\r\nfall by myriads and myriads from the gills of a single agaric were to\r\ngerminate? Here again we have the story of the cod, the louse, all the\r\nfeeble creatures, in short, that reproduce their kind in such immense\r\nnumbers.”\r\n\r\n“To have mushrooms, then, as many as we want, it is only necessary to\r\nsow the spores?” Jules again inquired.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spores]\r\n\r\n\r\n“In that you are mistaken, my dear child. Up to this time mushroom\r\nculture has been impossible, because the care required by their\r\nexcessively delicate seeds is not understood by us, or may even be\r\nbeyond our power. Only one edible mushroom is cultivated, and even in\r\ngrowing this we use not the spores, but the mycelium.\r\n\r\n“They call it the hot-bed mushroom. It is an agaric, satiny white above\r\nand pale rose beneath. In the old stone quarries near Paris they make\r\nbeds of horse manure and light earth. In these beds they put pieces of\r\nmycelium known to horticulturists under the name of mushroom-spawn. This\r\nspawn ramifies, pushes out numerous filaments, and from these finally\r\nspring the mushrooms.”\r\n\r\n“Good to eat!”\r\n\r\n“Excellent. Among the mushrooms we gathered are those that I am going to\r\nacquaint you with.\r\n\r\n“Look at this first of all. It is an agaric. The upper surface of the\r\ncap is a beautiful orange-red; the gills underneath are yellow. The\r\nstalk rises from the bottom of a sort of white bag with torn edges. This\r\nbag, called _volva_ at first enveloped the whole mushroom. In growing\r\nand pushing above ground, the cap broke it. This kind, they say, is the\r\nbest of all, the most appreciated. It is called the orange-agaric.\r\n\r\n“This other agaric, likewise orange-red, and also provided with a bag or\r\nvolva at the base of the stalk, is called the false orange-agaric. Would\r\nyou not, however, think it was the same kind?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see much difference, for my part,” responded Claire.\r\n\r\n“Nor I either,” said Emile.\r\n\r\n“I see a difference,” Jules declared, “but it is very slight. The second\r\nagaric has white gills, while the first has yellow.”\r\n\r\n“Jules has sharp eyes. I will add that in the false orange-agaric the\r\nupper surface of the cap is sown with shreds of white skin, debris of\r\nthe torn volva. The other one has not these shreds, or very few.\r\n\r\n“If one did not pay attention to these slight differences, one would\r\ncommit a very fatal error. The first mushroom is a delicious viand; the\r\nsecond, or false orange-agaric, is a deadly poison.”\r\n\r\n“I am no longer surprised,” said Jules, “at your telling Simon that it\r\nis impossible for us, without long study, to distinguish the good from\r\nthe bad kinds. Here are two mushrooms almost as much alike as two drops\r\nof water: one kills, the other is excellent.”\r\n\r\n“Not a year passes without its lamentable cases of poisoning, from a\r\nconfusion of the two kinds. Remember carefully their characteristics, so\r\nas not to expose yourself some day to a terrible mistake.”\r\n\r\n“I will be very careful not to forget them,” Jules promised. “Both\r\norange-agarics are orange-red and have a white volva or bag. The eatable\r\norange-agaric has yellow gills; the poisonous one, white gills.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” added Emile, “the poisonous orange-agaric has numerous shreds\r\nof white skin on the cap.”\r\n\r\n“Look at this other that I picked from the trunk of a tree. It is a\r\nlarge, dark-red boletus. It has no stalk. It fastens itself to old\r\ntrunks by one of its sides. It is called the tinder-agaric boletus,\r\nbecause its flesh, cut in thin slices, dried in the sun, and made\r\nflexible by hammering, makes tinder.”\r\n\r\n“I did not dream that tinder came from a mushroom.” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“The truffle is the most important of eatable mushrooms. It grows under\r\nground, like the mycelium that produces it. Its odor betrays its\r\npresence. A very keen-scented animal, the pig, is led into the wood.\r\nEnticed by the smell of the subterranean mushroom, the pig roots with\r\nits snout at the spots where the truffles are hidden. Then the pig is\r\ndriven away, but to console him they throw him a chestnut; and finally\r\nthe precious mushroom is dug up. In its shape the truffle bears no\r\nresemblance to ordinary mushrooms. It has a bulky round body, wrinkled,\r\nand black flesh marbled with white.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXVI\r\n\r\n                              EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY in the morning all the neighbors were talking, from door to door,\r\non the same subject. It seemed they had had a narrow escape during the\r\nnight. Jacques said that about two o’clock he had been awakened by the\r\nbellowing of his cattle, repeated two or three times. Even Azor himself,\r\nthe good Azor, so peaceful in his stall when there was nothing serious\r\nto disturb him, had bellowed mournfully. Jacques had risen and lighted\r\nhis lantern, but had been unable to discover what caused the trouble\r\nwith the animals.\r\n\r\nMother Ambroisine, who slept with one eye open, told a longer tale. She\r\nhad heard the dishes rattling on the kitchen dresser; some plates had\r\neven rolled off and broken in falling to the ground. Mother Ambroisine\r\nwas thinking it was perhaps some misdeed of the cat’s, when it seemed to\r\nher that strong arms seized the bed and shook it twice from head to foot\r\nand from foot to head. It was over in the twinkling of an eye. The\r\nworthy woman was so frightened that, throwing the covers over her head,\r\nshe commended her soul to God.\r\n\r\nMathieu and his son were away at the time: they were returning home from\r\nthe fair, and were making the journey by night. The weather was fine—no\r\nwind, and bright moonlight. They were chatting about their affairs when\r\na dull, deep noise was heard, coming from under the ground. It sounded\r\nlike the roar of the big mill-dam. At the same moment they staggered as\r\nif the ground had been giving way under them. Then nothing more. The\r\nmoon continued to shine, the night was calm and serene. It was so soon\r\nover that Mathieu and his son wondered whether they had not dreamed it.\r\n\r\nThese were among the more serious incidents related. Meanwhile there was\r\npassing from mouth to mouth, moving some to incredulous smiles and\r\nothers to grave reflections, the terrible word “earthquake.”\r\n\r\nIn the evening Uncle Paul was surrounded by his auditors, eager for some\r\nexplanation of the great news of the day.\r\n\r\n“Is it true, Uncle,” asked Jules, “that the earth sometimes trembles?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing is truer, my dear child. Sometimes here, sometimes elsewhere,\r\nsuddenly there is a movement of the ground. In our privileged countries\r\nwe are far from having any exact idea of these terrible agitations of\r\nthe earth. If once in a while a slight trembling is felt, it is talked\r\nof for days as a curiosity; then it is forgotten. Many tell to-day of\r\nthe events of the past night without attaching much importance to them,\r\nnot knowing that the force revealed to us by a light movement of the\r\nearth can, in its brutal power, bring about frightful disasters. Jacques\r\nhas told you of the bellowing of the cattle and Azor’s outcry. Mother\r\nAmbroisine has described to you her fright when her bed was shaken\r\ntwice. In all that there is nothing very terrifying; but earthquakes are\r\nnot always harmless. Alas, no; and may God preserve us from ever\r\nundergoing the sad experience!”\r\n\r\n“Is an earthquake, then, very serious?” Jules again inquired. “For my\r\npart, I thought it only meant a few plates broken and some furniture\r\ndisplaced.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Claire, “that if the movement were strong enough\r\nhouses would fall down. But Uncle is going to tell us about a violent\r\nearthquake.”\r\n\r\n“Earthquakes are often preceded by subterranean noises, a dull rumbling\r\nthat swells, abates, swells again, as if a storm were bursting in the\r\ndepths of the earth. At this rumbling, full of menacing mysteries, every\r\ncreature becomes quiet, mute with fear, and every one turns pale. Warned\r\nby instinct, animals are struck with stupor. Suddenly the earth shivers,\r\nbulges up, subsides again, whirls, cracks open, and discloses a yawning\r\ngulf.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my goodness!” Claire exclaimed. “And what becomes of the people?”\r\n\r\n“You will see what becomes of them in these terrible catastrophes. Of\r\nall the earthquakes felt in Europe, the most terrible was that which\r\nravaged Lisbon in 1775, on All Saints’ Day. No danger appeared to menace\r\nthe festal town, when suddenly there burst from under-ground a rumbling\r\nlike continuous thunder. Then the ground, shaken violently several\r\ntimes, rose up, sank down, and in a moment the populous capital of\r\nPortugal was nothing but a heap of ruins and dead bodies. The people\r\nthat were still left, seeking refuge from the fall of the ruins, had\r\nretired to a large quay on the seashore. All at once the quay was\r\nswallowed up in the waters, dragging with it the crowd and the boats and\r\nships moored there. Not a victim, not a piece of wreck came back to\r\nfloat on the surface. An abyss had opened, swallowing up waters, quay,\r\nships, people, and, closing up again, kept them for ever. In six minutes\r\nsixty thousand persons perished.\r\n\r\n“While that was happening at Lisbon and the high mountains of Portugal\r\nwere shaking on their bases, several towns of Africa—Morocco, Fez,\r\nMequinez—were overthrown. A village of ten thousand souls was swallowed\r\nup with its entire population in an abyss suddenly opened and suddenly\r\nclosed.”\r\n\r\n“Never, Uncle, have I heard of such terrible things,” declared Jules.\r\n\r\n“And I laughed,” said Emile, “when Mother Ambroisine told us of her\r\nfright. It was nothing to laugh at. If it had been God’s will, our\r\nvillage might last night have disappeared from the earth with us all, as\r\ndid that one in Africa.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to this, too,” Uncle Paul continued. “In February, 1783, in\r\nSouthern Italy, convulsions began that lasted four years. During the\r\nfirst year alone nine hundred and forty-nine were counted. The surface\r\nof the ground was wrinkled in moving waves like the surface of a stormy\r\nsea, and on this unstable ground people felt nauseated as if on the deck\r\nof a vessel. Sea-sickness reigned on land. At every undulation, the\r\nclouds, really immobile, seemed to move bruskly, just as they do at sea\r\nwhen we are on a vessel tossed by the winds. Trees bowed in the\r\nterrestrial wave and swept the earth with their tops.\r\n\r\n“In two minutes the first shock overthrew the greater part of towns,\r\nvillages, and small boroughs of Southern Italy, as well as of Sicily.\r\nThe whole surface of the country was thrown into confusion. In several\r\nplaces the ground was creviced with fissures, resembling on a large\r\nscale the cracks in a pane of broken glass. Vast tracts of ground, with\r\ntheir cultivated fields, their dwellings, vines, olive-trees, slid down\r\nthe mountain-sides and went considerable distances, to settle finally on\r\nother sites. Here, hills split in two; there, they were torn from their\r\nplaces and transported to some other part. Elsewhere, there was nothing\r\nto uphold the ground, and it was engulfed in yawning abysses, taking\r\nwith it dwellings, trees, and animals, which were never seen again; in\r\nstill other places, deep funnels full of moving sand opened, forming\r\npresently vast cavities that were soon converted into lakes by the\r\ninrush of subterranean waters. It is estimated that more than two\r\nhundred lakes, ponds, and marshes were thus suddenly produced.\r\n\r\n“In certain places the ground, softened by waters turned from their\r\nchannels or brought from the interior by the crevices, was converted\r\ninto torrents of mud that covered the plains or filled the valleys. The\r\ntops of trees and the roofs of ruined farm buildings were the only\r\nthings to be seen above this sea of mud.\r\n\r\n“At intervals sudden quakes shook the ground to a great depth. The\r\nshocks were so violent that street pavements were torn from their beds\r\nand leaped into the air. The masonry of wells flew out from below the\r\nsurface in one piece, like a small tower thrown up from the earth. When\r\nthe ground rose and split open, houses, people, and animals were\r\ninstantly swallowed up; then, the ground subsiding again, the crevice\r\nclosed once more, and, without leaving a vestige, everything\r\ndisappeared, crushed between the two walls of the abyss as they drew\r\ntogether. Some time afterward, when, after the disaster, excavations\r\nwere made in order to recover valuable lost objects, the workmen\r\nobserved that the buried buildings and all that they contained were one\r\ncompact mass, so violent had been the pressure of this sort of vise\r\nformed by the two edges of the closed-up crevice.\r\n\r\n“The number of persons who perished in these terrible circumstances is\r\nestimated at eighty thousand.\r\n\r\n“Most of these victims were buried alive under the ruins of their\r\nhouses; others were consumed by fires that sprang up in these ruins\r\nafter each shock; others, fleeing across the country, were swallowed up\r\nin the abysses that opened under their feet.\r\n\r\n“The sight of such calamities ought to have awakened pity in the hearts\r\nof barbarians. And yet—who would believe it?—except for a very few acts\r\nof heroism, the conduct of the people was most infamous. The Calabrian\r\npeasants ran to the towns, not to give help, but to pillage. Without any\r\nconcern about the danger, they traversed the streets in the midst of\r\nburning walls and clouds of dust, kicking and robbing the victims even\r\nbefore the breath had left their bodies.”\r\n\r\n“Miserable creatures!” cried Jules. “Horrid rascals! Ah, if I had only\r\nbeen there!”\r\n\r\n“If you had been there, what would you have done, my poor child? There\r\nwere plenty there with as good hearts and better fists than yours, but\r\nthey could do nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Are those Calabrians very wicked?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“Wherever education has not been introduced there are brutal natures\r\nthat, in time of trouble, spring up, no one knows whence, and frighten\r\nthe world with their atrocities. Another story will teach you more of\r\nthe Calabrian peasants.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXVII\r\n\r\n                        SHALL WE KILL THEM BOTH?\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE PAUL went up to his room and came back with a book.\r\n\r\n“What I am going to read to you is from a mounted artilleryman, more\r\nexpert in the art of the pen than in that of the cannon. At the\r\nbeginning of this century a French army occupied Calabria. Our gunner\r\nbelonged to it. Here is a letter he wrote to his cousin:\r\n\r\n“‘One day I was traveling in Calabria. It is a country of bad people who\r\nlove no one and have a special spite against the French. It would take\r\ntoo long to tell you why; enough that they mortally hate us and one is\r\nsure of a bad time if one falls into their hands.\r\n\r\n“‘My companion was a young man. In these mountains the roads are\r\nprecipices; our horses could hardly climb them. My comrade was in front.\r\nA path that seemed to him shorter and more practicable misled us. It was\r\nmy fault. Ought I to have put my trust in a man of twenty years? As long\r\nas daylight lasted we tried to find our way through the woods; but the\r\nmore we tried the more bewildered we got, and it was pitch dark when we\r\nreached a dimly lighted house. We entered, not without suspicion, but\r\nwhat could we do?\r\n\r\n“‘There we found a charcoal-burner and all his family at table, to which\r\nthey immediately invited us. My young man needed no urging. We sat down,\r\neating and drinking, or he at least, for I busied myself examining the\r\nplace and the countenances of our hosts. They had the appearance of\r\ncharcoal-burners, but the house might have been taken for an arsenal. It\r\nwas full of guns, pistols, sabers, knives, cutlasses. It all displeased\r\nme, and I saw well that I on my part was equally displeasing to our\r\nentertainers.\r\n\r\n“‘My comrade, on the contrary, made himself one of the family; he\r\nlaughed, chaffed with them, and, with an imprudence that I ought to have\r\nforeseen, told them at the very first whence we came, whither we were\r\ngoing, who we were. Frenchmen, imagine it! Amongst our most mortal\r\nenemies, alone, lost, far from all human aid; and then, to add to our\r\nprobable ruin, he acted the rich man, promising these people whatever\r\nthey wished in payment and for the hire of guides on the morrow.\r\nFinally, he spoke of his valise, begging them to be very careful of it\r\nand to put it at the head of his bed: he said he did not wish any other\r\nbolster. Ah! youth, youth, how your immaturity is to be pitied! Cousin,\r\nyou would have thought we were carrying the crown diamonds!’”\r\n\r\n“That young man was certainly very imprudent,” commented Jules. “Could\r\nhe not hold his tongue, seeing he was in the hands of wicked people?”\r\n\r\n“Silence is very difficult for giddy, careless young persons. I will go\r\non:\r\n\r\n“‘Supper finished, they left us. Our hosts slept below, we in the upper\r\nroom where we had eaten. A loft seven or eight feet high, reached by a\r\nladder, was the bed that awaited us—a kind of nest that one got into by\r\ncrawling under joists laden with provisions for a year. My comrade\r\nclimbed up alone and was soon asleep, his head on the precious valise; I\r\ndetermined to watch, so made a good fire and sat down by it.\r\n\r\n“‘The night had almost passed, quietly enough, and I began to feel\r\nreassured, when, just as it seemed to me it must be near daylight, I\r\nheard our host and his wife quarreling immediately under me, and,\r\nputting my ear close to the fire-place that communicated with the one\r\nbelow, I distinguished perfectly this proposal of the husband: “Well,\r\nnow, let us see; shall we kill them both?” To which the woman answered:\r\n“Yes.” And I heard nothing more.\r\n\r\n“‘What can I say? I remained scarcely breathing, my body cold as marble.\r\nGod! When I think of it! We two all but unarmed against those twelve or\r\nfifteen with so many weapons! And my comrade dead with sleep and\r\nfatigue! To make a noise by calling him, I dared not; to escape by\r\nmyself, I could not. The window was not far from the ground, but beneath\r\nit two big dogs were howling like wolves.’”\r\n\r\n“Poor gunner!” Emile exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“And his comrade sleeping like a simpleton!” Claire added.\r\n\r\n“‘At the end of a quarter of an hour, which seemed long, I heard some\r\none on the stairs, and through the cracks of the door I saw the father,\r\na lamp in one hand and one of his large knives in the other. He was\r\ncoming up, his wife following him. I placed myself behind the door as he\r\nopened it; he put down the lamp, and his wife came and took it; then he\r\nentered, barefoot. From outside she said to him in a low tone, shading\r\nthe lamp with her hand: “Gently, go gently!” When he came to the ladder,\r\nhe mounted, knife between his teeth, and reaching the height of the bed\r\non which lay this poor young man, his throat uncovered, with one hand he\r\ngrasped his knife, and with the other—Ah! cousin—’”\r\n\r\n“Enough, Uncle; this story frightens me!” cried Claire.\r\n\r\n“Wait—‘And with the other he seized a ham that was hanging from the\r\nceiling, cut off a slice, and went off the way he had come. The door\r\nclosed, the lamp disappeared, and I was left alone with my\r\nreflections.’”\r\n\r\n“And then?” inquired Jules.\r\n\r\n“And then, nothing more. ‘As soon as it was daylight,’ continued the\r\ngunner, ‘the whole family came and awakened us with much noise, as we\r\nhad requested them. They brought food and served us a very good\r\nbreakfast, I assure you. Two capons were part of it, one of which our\r\nhostess said we must eat, and take the other with us. On seeing them I\r\nunderstood the significance of those terrible words: _Shall we kill them\r\nboth?_’”\r\n\r\n“The man and woman were discussing whether they should kill both capons\r\nor only one for breakfast?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“That and nothing else,” replied his uncle.\r\n\r\n“All the same, the gunner had a bad quarter of an hour for his mistake.”\r\n\r\n“Those charcoal-burners were not at all such bad people as I thought at\r\nfirst,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“That is the point I wished to make. Calabria, like all countries, has\r\nits good and its bad people.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXVIII\r\n\r\n                            THE THERMOMETER\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE story of the gunner,” Jules remarked, “ended very differently from\r\nwhat one expected at the beginning. Just when one thinks the two\r\ntravelers are done for, it turns out nothing more serious is in question\r\nthan the roasting of two fowls. A shiver of fear seizes you when the man\r\nclimbs the ladder with the cutlass between his teeth; the next minute\r\nyou are laughing. That is a very amusing story; but it has turned us\r\naside from the earthquakes. You have not told us yet the cause of these\r\nterrible movements of the ground.”\r\n\r\n“If that interests you,” replied his uncle, “let us talk about it a\r\nlittle. I will tell you first that the farther you descend into the\r\nearth, the hotter it becomes. Excavations made by man for obtaining\r\nvarious minerals give us valuable information on this subject. The\r\ndeeper they go, the hotter it is. For every thirty meters of depth there\r\nis an increase of one degree in temperature.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know very well what a degree is,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“And I don’t know anything about it,” confessed Emile.\r\n\r\n“Let us begin with that; if not, it would be impossible for you to\r\nunderstand. In my room you have seen, on a little wooden board, a glass\r\nrod pierced by a very fine canal and ending at the bottom in a little\r\nbulb. In the bulb is a red liquid, which ascends or descends in the\r\ncanal of the tube according to whether it is warmer or colder. That is\r\ncalled a thermometer. In freezing water the red liquid goes down to a\r\npoint in the tube called zero; in boiling water it goes up to a point\r\nmarked 100. The distance between these two points is divided into one\r\nhundred equal parts called degrees.”[3]\r\n\r\n“Why degrees?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“By that it is meant that these divisions have a certain resemblance to\r\nthe degrees or steps of a flight of stairs, or the rounds of a ladder.\r\nThe red liquid goes up or down from division to division just as we\r\nmount or descend a flight of stairs step by step. If it grows warmer,\r\nthe red liquid moves and little by little climbs the steps; if colder,\r\nit goes down the ladder. Thus the heat can be estimated according to the\r\nstep or degree where the liquid stops.\r\n\r\n“It is freezing when the liquid goes down to zero; the heat is that of\r\nboiling water when it goes up to division 100. The intermediate steps or\r\ndegrees indicate, evidently, other states of heat, greater when the\r\ndegree is higher up on the ladder.\r\n\r\n“The degree of heat of any body, as indicated by the thermometer, is\r\ncalled its temperature. Thus we say the temperature of freezing water is\r\nzero, that of boiling water one hundred degrees.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  It is the centigrade thermometer that is here described.—_Translator._\r\n\r\n“One morning,” said Emile, “when you sent me to get something from your\r\nroom, I put my hand on the little bulb of the thermometer. The red\r\nliquid began to go up, little by little.”\r\n\r\n“It was the warmth of your hand that made it go up.”\r\n\r\n“I wanted to see how high the liquid would go, but I had not patience to\r\nwait till the end.”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you. At last the thermometer would have marked at most 38\r\ndegrees, which is the temperature of the human body.”\r\n\r\n“And in the very hot days of summer what degree does the thermometer\r\nmark?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“In our region the greatest heat of summer is from 25 to 35 degrees.”\r\n\r\n“And in the hottest countries of the world?” Claire inquired.\r\n\r\n“In the hottest countries, Senegal, for example, the temperature rises\r\nto 45 and 50 degrees. It is twice as hot as our summer.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXIX\r\n\r\n                        THE SUBTERRANEAN FURNACE\r\n\r\n\r\n“LET us get back to our subject. At the bottom of mines, I told you, a\r\nhigh temperature prevails, which keeps up during the whole year. There\r\nis always the same heat, winter and summer. The deepest excavation\r\nminers have ever made is in Bohemia. It is inaccessible to-day.\r\nLandslides have partly filled it. At the depth of 1151 meters the\r\nthermometer indicated a perpetual heat of forty degrees, almost the\r\ntemperature of the hottest regions in the world. And that, mind you, in\r\nwinter as well as summer. When mountainous Bohemia was covered with ice\r\nand snow, it was only necessary to go down to the bottom of the mine to\r\npass from the rigors of winter to the insupportable heat of a Senegal\r\nsummer. One shivered with cold at the entrance and stifled with heat at\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\n“The same conditions, without exception, prevail everywhere. The deeper\r\none descends in the earth, the hotter one finds the temperature. In deep\r\nmines the heat is such that the most unobservant workman is struck by it\r\nand wonders if he is not near some immense furnace.”\r\n\r\n“The interior of the earth is, then, really a stove?” queried Jules.\r\n\r\n“Much more than a stove, as you will see. The name of artesian well is\r\ngiven to a cylindrical hole which by means of strong iron bars, fitted\r\nend to end, is made in the ground until some reservoir of subterranean\r\nwater, fed by the infiltrations of neighboring streams or lakes, is\r\nreached. The water that comes up from far under ground as the result of\r\nsuch a boring reaches the surface at a temperature equal to that of\r\nthose depths; and thus we learn about the distribution of heat in the\r\nbowels of the earth. One of the most remarkable of these wells is that\r\nof Grenelle, at Paris. It is 547 meters deep, and the water in it is\r\nconstantly at 28 degrees, a temperature almost as high as that of the\r\nhottest summer days. The water of the artesian well of Mondorf, on the\r\nfrontier of France and Luxemburg, comes from a far greater depth, 700\r\nmeters. Its temperature is 35 degrees. Artesian wells, of which there\r\nare at present a considerable number, illustrate the same principle as\r\nmines: for every thirty meters of depth the heat increases one degree.”\r\n\r\n“Then by digging wells deep enough we should at last come to boiling\r\nwater?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. The difficulty is to attain the desired depth. To reach the\r\ntemperature of boiling water it would be necessary to bore about three\r\nquarters of a league, which is impossible. However, a number of natural\r\nsprings are known which, as they come from the ground, possess a high\r\ntemperature, sometimes reaching the boiling point. They are called\r\nthermal springs, which means hot springs. There prevails, then, at the\r\ndepth from which they come, a heat sufficient to make them tepid, or\r\neven boiling hot. The most remarkable hot springs of France are those of\r\nChaudes-Aigues and Vic, in Cantal. They are almost boiling.”\r\n\r\n“Do these springs make streams that are different from others?”\r\n\r\n“Steaming streams, in which you can plunge an egg for a moment and take\r\nit out cooked.”\r\n\r\n“Then there are no little fish or crabs,” said Emile.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not, my dear. You understand that if there were any they\r\nwould be cooked through and through.”\r\n\r\n“That is true.”\r\n\r\n“The little streams of boiling water in Auvergne are nothing in\r\ncomparison with what are seen in Iceland, that large island situated at\r\nthe extreme north of Europe and covered with snow the greater part of\r\nthe year. It has numbers of springs throwing up hot water, called in\r\nthat country geysers. The most powerful, or the Great Geyser, springs\r\nfrom a large basin situated on the top of a hill formed by the smooth\r\nwhite incrustations deposited by the foam of the water. The interior of\r\nthis basin is funnel-shaped and terminates in tortuous conduits\r\npenetrating to unknown depths.\r\n\r\n“Each eruption of this volcano of boiling water is announced by a\r\ntrembling of the earth and dull noises like distant detonations of some\r\nsubterranean artillery. Every moment the detonations become stronger;\r\nthe earth trembles, and, from the bottom of the crater, the water rushes\r\nup in an impetuous torrent and fills the basin, where, for a few\r\nmoments, we have what looks like a boiler heated by some invisible\r\nfurnace. In the midst of a whirlpool of steam the water rises in a\r\nboiling flood. Suddenly the geyser musters all its force: there is a\r\nloud explosion, and a column of water six meters in diameter spouts\r\nupward to the height of sixty meters, and falls again in steaming\r\nshowers after having expanded in the shape of an immense sheaf crowned\r\nwith white vapor. This formidable outburst lasts only a few moments.\r\nSoon the liquid sheaf sinks; the water in the basin retires, to be\r\nswallowed up in the depths of the crater, and is replaced by a column of\r\nsteam, furious and roaring, which spouts upward with thunderous\r\nreverberations and, in its indomitable force, hurls aloft huge masses of\r\nrock that have fallen into the crater, or breaks them into tiny bits.\r\nThe whole neighborhood is veiled in these dense eddies of steam. Finally\r\ncalm is restored and the fury of the geyser abates, but only to burst\r\nforth again later and repeat the same program.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Giant Geyser, Yellowstone National Park]\r\n\r\n\r\n“That must be terrible and beautiful at the same time,” commented Emile.\r\n“No doubt you look at this furious fountain from a long distance, so as\r\nnot to be struck on the back by boiling showers.”\r\n\r\n“What you have just told us, Uncle,” said Jules, “shows plainly that\r\nthere is great heat under ground.”\r\n\r\n“In admitting, as all these observations justify us in doing, that the\r\nsubterranean temperature increases with the depth one degree for every\r\nthirty meters, it is estimated that at three kilometers or three\r\nquarters of a league down, the temperature must be that of boiling\r\nwater, that is to say 100 degrees. Five leagues down, the heat is that\r\nof red-hot iron; at twelve leagues it is sufficient to melt all known\r\nsubstances. At a greater depth the temperature, apparently, is still\r\nhigher. Accordingly we are to imagine the earth is formed of a globe of\r\nmatter liquefied by fire and enveloped by a thin crust of solid material\r\nthat is upborne by that central ocean of melted minerals.”\r\n\r\n“You say,” said Claire, “a thin crust of solid material; and yet,\r\naccording to the calculations you have just mentioned, the thickness of\r\nthe solid material must be about twelve leagues. Under that would be the\r\nmelted matter. It seems to me twelve leagues make a good thickness, and\r\nwe have nothing to fear from the subterranean fire.”\r\n\r\n“Twelve leagues are very little in relation to the earth’s dimensions.\r\nThe distance from the surface of the earth to its center is 1600\r\nleagues. Of this distance about twelve leagues belong to the thickness\r\nof the solid crust, all the rest to the molten globe. On a ball two\r\nmeters in diameter the solid crust of the earth would be represented by\r\na thickness of half a finger’s breadth. Let us make a more simple\r\ncomparison, representing the earth by an egg. Well, the egg-shell is the\r\nsolid crust of the globe; its liquid content is the central mass in\r\nfusion.”\r\n\r\n“And we are separated from the immense subterranean furnace only by that\r\nthin shell!” exclaimed Jules. “That is not at all reassuring.”\r\n\r\n“I agree, it is not without a certain emotion that one hears for the\r\nfirst time what science tells us of these intimate details of the\r\nearth’s structure; one cannot think without fear of those burning\r\nabysses that roll their waves of melted minerals a few leagues under our\r\nfeet. How can a covering, relatively so light, resist the fluctuations\r\nof the central liquid mass? This fragile crust, this shell of the globe,\r\nwill it not some time melt, become disjointed, crumble, or at least\r\nmove? The little it does move makes continents tremble and the ground\r\ncrack open in frightful chasms.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” interposed Claire, “that is the cause of earthquakes. The liquid\r\nthat is inside is stirred, and the shell moves.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” Jules remarked, “that this shell, comparatively so\r\nthin, ought to tremble oftener.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not a day passes without the solid crust of the earth\r\nexperiencing some shock, sometimes at one point, sometimes at another,\r\nbeneath the bed of the seas, as well as under the continents. However,\r\ndisastrous earthquakes are very rare, thanks to the intervention of\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\n“Volcanic orifices are, in fact, veritable safety-valves, which put the\r\ninterior of the globe in communication with the exterior. By offering\r\npermanent vents to the subterranean vapors that tend to liberate\r\nthemselves by overturning the earth, they render earthquakes less\r\nfrequent and less disastrous. In volcanic countries every time the\r\nground is shaken by strong shocks, the earthquake ceases the moment the\r\nvolcano begins to throw up its fumes and lava.”\r\n\r\n“I well remember,” said Jules, “your account of the eruption of Etna and\r\nthe Catanian disaster. At first I only saw in volcanoes terrible\r\nmountains spreading devastation around them; now I begin to see their\r\ngreat use, their necessity. Without their air-holes, the earth would\r\nseldom be still.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXX\r\n\r\n                                 SHELLS\r\n\r\n\r\nIN Uncle Paul’s room was a drawer full of shells of all sorts. One of\r\nhis friends had collected them in his travels. Pleasant hours could be\r\npassed in looking at them. Their beautiful colors, their pleasing but\r\nsometimes odd shapes, diverted the eye. Some were twisted like a spiral\r\nstair-case, others widened out in large horns, still others opened and\r\nclosed like a snuff-box. Some were ornamented with radiating ribs,\r\nknotty creases, or plates laid one on another like the slates of a roof;\r\nsome bristled with points, spines, or jagged scales. Here were some\r\nsmooth as eggs, sometimes white, sometimes spotted with red; others,\r\nnear the rose-tinted opening, had long points resembling wide-stretched\r\nfingers. They came from all parts of the world. This came from the land\r\nof the negroes, that from the Red Sea, others from China, India, Japan.\r\nTruly, many pleasant hours could be passed in examining them one by one,\r\nespecially if Uncle Paul were to tell you about them.\r\n\r\nOne day Uncle Paul gave his nephews this pleasure: he spread before them\r\nthe riches of his drawer. Jules and Claire looked at them with\r\namazement; Emile was never tired of putting the large shells to his ear\r\nand listening to the continual _hoo-hoo-hoo_ that escapes from their\r\ndepths and seems to repeat the murmur of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cassis]\r\n\r\n\r\n“This one with the red and lace-like opening comes from India. It is\r\ncalled a helmet. Some are so large that two of them would be as much as\r\nEmile could carry. In some islands they are so abundant that they are\r\nused instead of stones and are burnt in kilns to make lime.”\r\n\r\n“I would not burn them for lime,” said Jules, “if I found such beautiful\r\nshells. See how red the opening is, how beautifully the edges are\r\npleated.”\r\n\r\n“And then what a loud murmur it makes,” added Emile. “Is it true, Uncle,\r\nthat it is the noise of the sea echoed by the shell?”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spiny Mollusk]\r\n\r\n\r\n“I do not deny that it resembles a little the murmur of waves heard at a\r\ndistance; but you must not think that the shell keeps in its folds an\r\necho of the noise of the waves. It is simply the effect of the air going\r\nand coming through the tortuous cavity.\r\n\r\n“This other belongs to France. It is common on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean and belongs to the genus _cassis_.”\r\n\r\n“It goes _hoo-hoo_, like the helmet,” Emile remarked.\r\n\r\n“All those that are rather large and have a spiral cavity do the same.\r\n\r\n“Here is another which, like the preceding, is found in the\r\nMediterranean. It is the spiny mollusk. The creature that inhabits it\r\nproduces a violet glair, from which the ancients derived, for their\r\ncostly stuffs, a magnificent color called purple.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paludinidæ]\r\n\r\n\r\n“How are shells made?” asked Claire.\r\n\r\n“Shells are the dwellings of creatures called mollusks, the same as the\r\nspiral snail’s shell is the house of the horny little animal that eats\r\nyour young flowering plants.”\r\n\r\n“Then the snail’s house is a shell, the same as the beautiful ones you\r\nhave shown us,” Jules observed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my child. It is in the sea that we find, in greatest number, the\r\nlargest and most beautiful shells. They are called sea-shells. To these\r\nbelong the helmet-shell, cassidula, and spiny mollusk. But fresh waters,\r\nthat is to say streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, have them too. The\r\nsmallest ditch in our country has shells of good shape but somber,\r\nearthy in color. They are called fresh-water shells.”\r\n\r\n“I have seen some in the water resembling large, pointed, spiral\r\nsnails,” said Jules. “They have a sort of cap to close the opening.”\r\n\r\n“They are Paludinidæ.”\r\n\r\n“I remember another ditch shell,” said Claire. “It is round, flat, and\r\nas large as a ten or even twenty-sou piece.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Planorbinæ]\r\n\r\n\r\n“That is one of the Planorbinæ. Finally, there are shells that are\r\nalways found on land and for that reason are called land-shells. Such is\r\nthe spiral snail.”\r\n\r\n“I have seen very pretty snails,” Jules remarked, “almost as pretty as\r\nthe shells in this drawer. In the woods you see yellow ones with several\r\nblack bands wound round them in regular order.”\r\n\r\n“The creature we call the spiral snail—isn’t it a slug that finds an\r\nempty shell and lives in it?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“No, my friend; a slug remains always a slug without becoming a snail;\r\nthat is to say, it never has a shell. The snail, on the contrary, is\r\nborn with a tiny shell that grows little by little as the snail grows.\r\nThe empty shells you find in the country have had their inhabitants,\r\nwhich are now dead and turned to dust, only their houses remaining.”\r\n\r\n“A slug and a snail without its shell are very much alike.”\r\n\r\n“Both are mollusks. There are mollusks that do not make shells, the slug\r\nfor example; others that do make them, such as the snails, the\r\nPaludinidæ, and the cassididæ.”\r\n\r\n“And of what does the snail make its house?”\r\n\r\n“Of its own substance, my little friend; it sweats the materials for its\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you make your teeth, so white, shiny, and all in a row? From time\r\nto time a new one pushes through, without your giving it any thought. It\r\ndoes it by itself. These beautiful teeth are of very hard stone. Where\r\ndoes that stone come from? From your own substance, it is clear. Our\r\ngums sweat stone which fashions itself into teeth. So the snail’s house\r\nis built. The little creature sweats the stone that shapes itself into a\r\ngraceful shell.”\r\n\r\n“But to arrange stones one on another and make houses of them you need\r\nmasons. The snail’s house is made without masons.”\r\n\r\n“When I say it is done by itself, I do not mean that the stone has the\r\nfaculty of making itself into a shell. You never see rubble piling\r\nitself unaided into a wall. God, the Father of all things, willed that\r\nthe stone should arrange itself in a mother-of-pearl palace to serve as\r\na dwelling for the poor animal, brother to the slug, and it is\r\naccomplished according to His will. In like manner He told the stone to\r\ngrow up into beautiful teeth from the depths of the rosy gums of little\r\nboys and girls, and it is done as He willed.”\r\n\r\n“I begin to feel rather friendly toward the snail, the voracious animal\r\nthat eats our flowers,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“I do not care to make you friendly with it. Let us make war on it since\r\nit ravages our gardens; it is our right; but do not let us disdain to\r\nlearn from it, for it has many beautiful things to teach us. To-day I\r\nwill tell you of its eyes and nose.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXXI\r\n\r\n                            THE SPIRAL SNAIL\r\n\r\n\r\n“WHEN the snail crawls, it bears aloft, as you know, four horns.”\r\n\r\n“Horns that come out and go in at will,” added Jules.\r\n\r\n“Horns that the animal turns every way,” said Emile, “when you put the\r\nshell on the live coals. Then the snail sings _be-be-be-eou-eou_.”\r\n\r\n“Stop that cruel play, my child. The snail does not sing; it is\r\ncomplaining, in its own way, of the fiery tortures. Its slime,\r\ncoagulated by the heat, first swells and then shrinks, and the air that\r\nescapes by little puffs produces that dying wail.\r\n\r\n“In one of La Fontaine’s fables, where there are so many good things\r\nabout animals, he tells us that the lion, wounded by a horned animal,\r\n\r\n          “Straight banished from his realm, ’t is said,\r\n            All sorts of beasts with horns—\r\n            Rams, bulls, goats, stags, and unicorns.\r\n          Such brutes all promptly fled.\r\n            A hare, the shadow of his ears perceiving,\r\n            Could hardly help believing\r\n          That some vile spy for horns would take them,\r\n          And food for accusation make them.\r\n            Adieu, said he, my neighbor cricket;\r\n            I take my foreign ticket.\r\n              My ears, should I stay here,\r\n              Will turn to horns, I fear;\r\n            And were they shorter than a bird’s,\r\n            I fear the effect of words.\r\n          These horns! the cricket answered; why,\r\n          God made them ears; who can deny?\r\n          Yes, said the coward, still they’ll make them horns,\r\n          And horns, perhaps, of unicorns!\r\n              In vain shall I protest.[4]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  The translation is that of Elizur Wright, Jr., published by James\r\n  Miller, New York, 1879.\r\n\r\n“This hare evidently exaggerated things. Its ears have remained ears, to\r\nall observers. We do not know whether the snail exiled himself in these\r\ncircumstances; man is almost unanimous in regarding as horns what the\r\nsnail bears on its forehead. ‘You call those horns!’ the cricket would\r\nhave exclaimed, being better advised than man; ‘you must take me for a\r\nfool.’”\r\n\r\n“Then they are not horns?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear. They are at once hands, eyes, nose, and a cane for the\r\nblind. They are called tentacles. There are two pairs of unequal length.\r\nThe upper pair is the longer and more remarkable.\r\n\r\n“Right at the end of each long tentacle you see a little black point. It\r\nis an eye as complete as that of the horse and ox, in spite of its\r\nminute dimensions. What is necessary for making an eye, you are far from\r\nsuspecting. It is so complicated I will not try to tell you. And yet it\r\nis all to be found in that little black point that is scarcely visible.\r\nThat is not all: beside the eye is a nose, that is to say an organ\r\nespecially sensitive to odors. The snail sees and smells with the tips\r\nof its long tentacles.”\r\n\r\n“I have noticed that if you bring anything near the snail’s long horns,\r\nthe animal draws them in.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elephant]\r\n\r\n\r\n“This combination of nose and eye can retreat, advance, go to meet an\r\nobject, and catch odors from all sides. To find a similar nose, you must\r\ngo from a snail to an elephant, whose trunk is an exceptionally long\r\nnose. But how much superior the snail’s is to the elephant’s! Sensitive\r\nto odors and light, eye and nose at the same time, it can retire within\r\nitself like the finger of a glove, disappear by reëntering the animal’s\r\nbody, or come out from under the skin and lengthen itself like a\r\ntelescope.”\r\n\r\n“I have often seen how the snail pulls his horns in,” observed Emile.\r\n“They fold back inward and seem to bury themselves under the skin. When\r\nanything annoys it, the animal puts its nose and eyes into its pocket.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely. To protect ourselves from too strong a light or an\r\nunpleasant odor, we shut our pupils and stop up our nose. The snail, if\r\nthe light troubles or some smell displeases it, sheathes eyes and nose\r\nin their covering; it puts them into its pocket, as Emile says.”\r\n\r\n“It is an ingenious way,” Claire remarked.\r\n\r\n“You said, too,” interposed Jules, “that the horns served it as a\r\nblindman’s cane.”\r\n\r\n“The animal is blind when it has drawn in its upper tentacles, partly or\r\nwholly; it then has only the two lower ones, which explore objects by\r\nthe touch better than does the cane of a blind man, for they are very\r\nsensitive. The two upper tentacles, besides their functions of eye and\r\nnose, also play the part of blindman’s cane, or, better still, that of a\r\nfinger that touches and recognizes objects. You see, little Emile, one\r\ndoes not know everything about a snail when one knows its wail on the\r\nfire.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Who of us would have suspected that those horns are eyes, nose,\r\nblindman’s cane, fingers, all at the same time?”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXII\r\n\r\n                       MOTHER-OF-PEARL AND PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n“SOME of the shells you have just shown us,” said Jules, “shine inside\r\nlike the handle of that pretty penknife you bought me the day of the\r\nfair—you know?—that four-bladed penknife with the mother-of-pearl\r\nhandle.”\r\n\r\n“That is plain enough. Mother-of-pearl, that pretty substance that\r\nshines with all the colors of the rainbow, comes from certain shells. We\r\nuse for delicate ornamentation what was once the dwelling of a glairy\r\nanimal, near relation to the oyster. Truly, this dwelling is a veritable\r\npalace in richness. It shines with all imaginable tints, as if the\r\nrainbow had deposited its colors there.\r\n\r\n“This is the shell that furnishes the most beautiful mother-of-pearl. It\r\nis called the meleagrina margaritifera. Outside it is wrinkled and\r\nblackish-green; inside it is smoother than polished marble, richer in\r\ncolor than the rainbow. All tints are found there, bright, but soft and\r\nchangeable, according to the point of view.”\r\n\r\n“That superb shell is the house of a miserable, slimy animal! In fairy\r\ntales the fairies themselves have none to equal it. Oh! how beautiful,\r\nhow beautiful it is!”\r\n\r\n“Every one has his portion in this world. The slimy animal has for his a\r\nsplendid palace of mother-of-pearl.”\r\n\r\n“Where does the meleagrina live?”\r\n\r\n“In the seas that wash the shores of Arabia.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Meleagrina (avicula) margaritifera]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Is Arabia very far away?” inquired Emile.\r\n\r\n“Very far, my dear. Why do you ask?”\r\n\r\n“Because I should like to pick up a lot of these beautiful shells.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t dream of such a thing. It is too far away, and, besides, they are\r\nnot to be gathered by every one that wants them. To get the meleagrina\r\nmen have to dive to the bottom of the sea, and some of them never come\r\nup again.”\r\n\r\n“And there are people who dare to dive to the bottom of the sea just to\r\nget shells?” asked Claire.\r\n\r\n“Plenty. So profitable, too, is the trade that we should be badly\r\nreceived by the first-comers if we took a notion to go and fish with\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Then those shells are very precious?”\r\n\r\n“You shall judge for yourself. First the inner layer of the shell, sawed\r\ninto sheets and tablets, is the mother-of-pearl that we use for fine\r\nornamentation. Jules’ penknife-handle is covered with a sheet of\r\nmother-of-pearl that was part of the inside of a pearl-shell. But that\r\nis the least part of what the precious shell produces. There are pearls\r\nas well.”\r\n\r\n“But pearls are not very dear. With a few sous I bought a whole boxful,\r\nto embroider you a purse.”\r\n\r\n“Let us make a distinction: there are pearls and pearls. The pearls you\r\nmention are little pieces of colored glass pierced with a hole. Their\r\nprice is very moderate. The pearls of the meleagrina are globules of the\r\nrichest and finest mother-of-pearl. If they are unusually large, they\r\nattain the fabulous price of the diamond, up to hundreds of thousands\r\nand millions of francs.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know those pearls.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oyster Shell]\r\n\r\n\r\n“God keep you from ever knowing them, for in becoming interested in\r\npearls one sometimes loses common sense and honor. It is well, though,\r\nto know how they are produced.\r\n\r\n“Between the two parts of the shell lives an animal like the oyster. It\r\nis a mass of slime in which you would find it difficult to recognize an\r\nanimal. It digests, however, and breathes, and is sensitive to pain, so\r\nsensitive that a grain of dust, a mere nothing, renders existence\r\npainful to it. What does the animal do when it feels itself tickled by\r\nsome foreign substance? It begins to sweat mother-of-pearl around the\r\nplace that itches. This mother-of-pearl piles up in a little smooth\r\nball, and there you have a pearl made by the sick, slimy animal. If it\r\nis of any considerable size, it will cost a fine bag of crowns, and the\r\nperson who wears it around her neck will be very proud of it.\r\n\r\n“But before getting to the neck, it must be fished for. The fishermen\r\nare in a boat. They descend into the sea, one after another, with the\r\naid of a rope to which is tied a large stone that drags them rapidly to\r\nthe bottom. The man about to dive seizes the weighted rope with his\r\nright hand and the toes of his right foot; with his left hand he closes\r\nhis nostrils; to his left foot is fastened a bag-shaped net. The stone\r\nis thrown into the sea. The man sinks like lead. Hastily he fills the\r\nnet with shells, and then pulls the rope to give the signal for ascent.\r\nThose in the boat pull him up. Half-suffocated, the diver reaches the\r\nsurface with his fishing. The efforts he has made to suspend respiration\r\nare so painful that sometimes blood gushes from his mouth and nose.\r\nSometimes, the diver comes up with a leg gone; sometimes he never comes\r\nup. A shark has swallowed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shark]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Some of those pearls that shine in a jeweler’s windows cost much more\r\nthan a fine bag of crowns: they may have cost a man’s life.”\r\n\r\n“If Arabia were at the end of the village, I would not go\r\npearl-fishing,” declared Emile.\r\n\r\n“To open the shells, they are exposed to the sun until the animals are\r\ndead. Then men rummage in the pile, which smells horribly, and get the\r\npearls. There is nothing more to do except pierce them with a hole.”\r\n\r\n“One day,” said Jules, “when they were cleaning the big mill-race I\r\nfound some shells that shone inside like mother-of-pearl.”\r\n\r\n“We have in our streams and ditches shells in two parts of a greenish\r\nblack. They are called fresh-water mussels. Their inside is\r\nmother-of-pearl. Some, very large and living by preference in mountain\r\nstreams, even produce pearls. But these pearls are far from having the\r\nluster and consequently the price of those of the meleagrina.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXIII\r\n\r\n                                THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\n“DO all those beautiful shells you have in the drawer come from the\r\nsea?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“They come from the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Is the sea very large?”\r\n\r\n“So large that in certain parts it takes ships whole months to go from\r\nshore to shore. They are fast vessels, too, especially the steamships.\r\nThey go almost as fast as a locomotive.”\r\n\r\n“And what is to be seen at sea?”\r\n\r\n“Overhead, the sky as here; all around, a large, blue, circular expanse,\r\nand beyond that nothing. One travels leagues and leagues, and yet is\r\nalways in the middle of that blue circle of waters, as if one had not\r\nadvanced. The rounded form of the earth, and consequently of the seas\r\ncovering the greater part of it, is the cause of this appearance. The\r\neye can take in only a small extent of the sea, an extent bounded by a\r\ncircular line on which the dome of the sky appears to rest; and as the\r\ncircle of the waters is ever being renewed while keeping the same\r\nappearance as one advances, it seems as if one remained stationary in\r\nthe center of the circle where the blue of the sky merges into the blue\r\nof the sea. However, by dint of this continued advance one finally\r\nperceives a little gray smoke on the line that bounds the view. It is\r\nland beginning to show. Another half-day’s journey, and the little gray\r\nsmoke will have become rocks on the coast or high mountains in the\r\ninterior.”\r\n\r\n“The sea is larger than the earth, the geography says,” remarked Jules.\r\n\r\n“If you divide the surface of the terrestrial globe into four equal\r\nparts, land will occupy about one of these parts, and the sea, taken all\r\ntogether, the other three.”\r\n\r\n“What is under the sea?”\r\n\r\n“Under the sea there is ground, the same as under the waters of a lake\r\nor stream. Under-sea ground is uneven, just as dry land is uneven. In\r\ncertain parts it is hollowed out into deep chasms that can scarcely be\r\nsounded; in others it is cut up with mountain-chains, the highest points\r\nof which come up above the level of the water and form islands; in still\r\nothers, it extends in vast plains or rises up in plateaus. If dry, it\r\nwould not differ from the continents.”\r\n\r\n“Then the depth is not the same everywhere?”\r\n\r\n“In no wise. To measure the depth of the water, a plummet attached to\r\none end of a very long cord is cast into the sea; the length of line\r\nunrolled by the plummet in its fall indicates the depth of the water.\r\n\r\n“The greatest depth of the Mediterranean appears to be between Africa\r\nand Greece. In these parts, in order to touch bottom, the lead unwinds\r\n4000 or 5000 meters of line. This depth equals the height of Mont Blanc,\r\nthe highest mountain in Europe.”\r\n\r\n“So if Mont Blanc were set down in this hollow,” was Claire’s comment,\r\n“its summit would only just reach the surface of the water.”\r\n\r\n“There are deeper places than that. In the Atlantic, south of the banks\r\nof Newfoundland, one of the best spots for cod-fishing, the lead shows\r\nabout 8000 meters. The highest mountains in the world, in Central Asia,\r\nare 8840 meters high.”\r\n\r\n“Those mountains would come up above the surface of the water in the\r\nplace you spoke of, and would form islands 850 meters in height.”\r\n\r\n“Finally, in the seas about the South Pole there are places where the\r\nlead shows 14,000 or 15,000 meters of depth, or nearly 4 leagues.\r\nNowhere has the dry land any such altitudes.\r\n\r\n“Between these fearful chasms and the shore where the water is no deeper\r\nthan the thickness of one’s finger, all the intermediate degrees may be\r\nfound, sometimes varying gradually, sometimes suddenly, according to the\r\nconfiguration of the ground underneath. On one shore the sea increases\r\nin depth with frightful rapidity. That shore is, then, the top of an\r\nescarpment of which the sea washes the base. On another it increases\r\nlittle by little, and one must go a long distance to attain a depth of a\r\nfew meters. There the ocean bed is a plain, sloping almost\r\nimperceptibly, in continuation of the terrestrial plain.\r\n\r\n“The average depth of the ocean appears to be from six to seven\r\nkilometers; that is to say, if all the submarine irregularities were to\r\ndisappear and give place to a level bed, like the bottom of a basin made\r\nby man, the seas, while preserving on the surface their present extent,\r\nwould have a uniform layer of water of from 6000 to 7000 meters in\r\ndepth.”\r\n\r\n“I get rather bewildered with all these kilometers,” complained Emile.\r\n“Never mind; I begin to understand that there is a great deal of water\r\nin the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Much more than you could ever imagine. You know the Rhone, the largest\r\nriver in France; you have seen it at flood, when its muddy waters form a\r\nsheet from one bank to the other as far as the eye can reach. It is\r\nestimated that in this condition it pours into the sea about five\r\nmillion liters of water a second. Well, if it always preserved that\r\nmajestic fulness, this large river could not, in twenty years, fill the\r\nthousandth part of the ocean basin. Does that make you understand any\r\nbetter how immense the sea is?”\r\n\r\n“My poor head is dizzy at the mere thought of it. What color are the\r\nwaters of the sea? Are they yellow and muddy like the Rhone?”\r\n\r\n“Never, except at the mouths of rivers. Seen in a small quantity, the\r\nwater looks colorless; seen in a great mass, it appears of its natural\r\ncolor, greenish blue. The sea, then, is blue with a greenish tinge,\r\ndarker in the open sea, clearer near the coasts. But this coloring\r\nchanges a great deal, according to the brightness of the sky. Under a\r\nbright sun the calm sea is now pale blue, now dark indigo; under a\r\nstormy sky it becomes bottle-green and almost black.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The waters of the great deep”]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXIV\r\n\r\n                        WAVES   SALT   SEAWEEDS\r\n\r\n\r\n“WHERE do the waves come from?” asked Jules. “The sea is very terrible,\r\nthey say, when it is angry.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear Jules, very terrible. I shall never forget those great\r\nmoving ridges, capped with foam, that toss a heavy ship like a nutshell,\r\ncarry it one moment on their monstrous backs, then let it plunge into\r\nthe liquid valley that intervenes. Oh! how small and weak one feels on\r\nthose four planks, mounting and plunging at the will of the waves! If\r\nthe nutshell springs a leak under the furious blows of the billows, may\r\nthe good God have pity on us! The shattered boat would disappear in\r\nfathomless depths.”\r\n\r\n“In the chasm you told us about?” Claire asked.\r\n\r\n“In those chasms from which no one returns. The shattered boat would be\r\nswallowed up in the sea, and nothing of you would be left but a\r\nremembrance, if there were people left on the earth who loved you.”\r\n\r\n“So the sea ought always to be calm,” said Jules.\r\n\r\n“It would be a pity, my child, if the sea were always at rest. This calm\r\nwould be incompatible with the salubrity of the seas, which must be\r\nviolently stirred up to keep them free from taint and to dissolve the\r\nair necessary to their animal and vegetable population. For the ocean of\r\nwaters, as for the atmosphere or ocean of air, there is need of a\r\nsalutary agitation—of tempests that churn up, renew, and vivify the\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\n“The wind disturbs the surface of the ocean. If it comes in gusts, it\r\ncreates waves that leap with foaming crest and break against one\r\nanother. If it is strong and continuous, it chases the waters in long\r\nswells, in waves or surges that advance from the open in parallel lines,\r\nsucceed one another with a majestic uniformity, and one after another\r\nrush booming on to the shore. These movements, however tumultuous they\r\nmay be, affect only the surface of the sea; thirty meters down the water\r\nis calm, even in the most violent storms.\r\n\r\n“In our seas the height of the biggest waves is not more than two or\r\nthree meters; but in some parts of the South Sea the waves, in\r\nexceptional weather, rise to ten or twelve meters. They are veritable\r\nchains of moving hills with broad and deep valleys between. Whipped by\r\nthe wind, their summits throw up clouds of foam and roll up in\r\nformidable volume with a force sufficient to shatter the largest vessels\r\nunder their weight.\r\n\r\n“The power of the waves borders on the prodigious. There, where the\r\nshore, rising vertically from the water, presents itself fully to the\r\nassaults of the sea, the shock is so violent that the earth trembles\r\nunder one’s feet. The most solid dikes are demolished and swept away;\r\nenormous blocks are torn off, dragged along the ground, sometimes thrown\r\nover jetties, where they roll like mere pebbles.\r\n\r\n“It is to the continual action of waves that cliffs are due, that is to\r\nsay the vertical escarpments serving in some places as shore for the\r\nsea. Such escarpments are seen on the coasts of the English Channel,\r\nboth in France and in England. Unceasingly the ocean undermines them,\r\ncauses pieces to fall down which it triturates into pebbles, and makes\r\nits way so much farther inland. History has preserved the memory of\r\ntowers, dwellings, even villages, that have had to be abandoned little\r\nby little on account of similar landslides, and that to-day have\r\nentirely disappeared beneath the waves.”\r\n\r\n“Stirred up like that, the waters of the sea are not likely to become\r\nputrid,” remarked Jules.\r\n\r\n“The movement of the waves alone would not suffice to insure the\r\nincorruptibility of sea-water. Another cause of salubrity comes in here.\r\nThe waters of the sea hold in solution numerous substances that give it\r\nan extremely disagreeable taste, but prevent its corruption.”\r\n\r\n“Then you cannot drink sea-water?” Emile asked.\r\n\r\n“No, not even if you were pressed with the greatest thirst.”\r\n\r\n“And what taste has sea-water?”\r\n\r\n“A taste at once bitter and salt, offensive to the palate and causing\r\nnausea. That taste comes from the dissolved substances. The most\r\nabundant is ordinary salt, the salt we use for seasoning our food.”\r\n\r\n“Salt, however,” objected Jules, “has no disagreeable taste, although\r\none cannot drink a glass of salt water.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless; but in the waters of the sea it is accompanied by many other\r\ndissolved substances whose taste is very disagreeable. The degree of\r\nsalt varies in different seas. A liter of water in the Mediterranean\r\ncontains 44 grams of saline substances; a liter of water in the Atlantic\r\nOcean contains only 32.\r\n\r\n“An attempt has been made to estimate, approximately, the total quantity\r\nof salt contained in the ocean. Were the ocean dried up and all its\r\nsaline ingredients left at the bottom, they would suffice to cover the\r\nwhole surface of the earth with a uniform layer ten meters thick.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a lot of salt!” cried Emile. “We should never see the end of\r\nit, however much we salted our food. Then salt is obtained from the\r\nsea?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. A low, level stretch of seashore is selected, basins are\r\ndug, shallow but of considerable extent; these are called salt marshes.\r\nThen the sea-water is admitted to these basins. When they are full, the\r\ncommunication with the sea is closed. The work on salt marshes is done\r\nin the summer. The heat of the sun causes the water to evaporate little\r\nby little, and the salt remains in a crystalline crust that is removed\r\nwith rakes. The accumulated salt is piled up in a big heap to let it\r\ndrain.”\r\n\r\n“If we should put a plate of salt water in the sun, would that be doing\r\nin a small way what is done in the salt marshes?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Exactly: the water would disappear, evaporated by the sun, and the salt\r\nwould remain in the plate.”\r\n\r\n“There are lots of fish in the sea, I know,” said Claire, “small, large,\r\nand monstrous. The sardine, cod, anchovy, tunny-fish, and ever so many\r\nmore come to us from the sea. There are also mollusks, as you call them,\r\nalso animals that cover themselves with a shell; then enormous crabs\r\nwith claws bigger than a man’s fist; and a lot of other creatures that I\r\ndon’t know. What do they all live on?”\r\n\r\n“First, they eat one another a good deal. The weakest becomes the prey\r\nof a stronger one, which in its turn finds its master and becomes food\r\nfor it. But it is plain that if the inhabitants of the sea had no other\r\nresource than devouring one another, sooner or later nourishment would\r\nfail them and they would perish.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Seaweed]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Therefore, in this matter of nutrition, things are ordered in the sea\r\nmuch as they are on land. Plants furnish alimentary matter. Certain\r\nspecies feed on the plant, others devour those that eat the plant; so\r\nthat, directly or indirectly, vegetation really nourishes them all.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said Jules. “A sheep browses the grass, a wolf eats the\r\nsheep, and so it is the grass that nourishes the wolf. There are, then,\r\nplants in the sea?”\r\n\r\n“In great abundance. Our prairies are not more grassy than the bottom of\r\nthe sea. Only, marine plants differ much from land ones. They never have\r\nblossoms, never anything that can be likened to leaves, never any roots.\r\nThey attach themselves to rocks by a stickiness at their base, without\r\nbeing able to draw nourishment from them. They feed on water and not on\r\nthe soil. Some resemble sticky thongs, folded ribbons, long manes;\r\nothers take the form of little tufted buds, soft top-knots, wavy plumes;\r\nstill others are slashed in strips, rolled in spirals, or shaped like\r\ncoarse, slimy threads. Some are olive-green, or pale rose-color; others\r\nare honey-yellow, or bright red. These odd plants are called seaweeds.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXXV\r\n\r\n                             RUNNING WATERS\r\n\r\n\r\n“I HAVE been told,” said Emile, “that the Rhone empties its waters into\r\nthe sea.”\r\n\r\n“The Rhone does run into the sea,” returned his uncle. “It pours into it\r\nevery second five million liters of water.”\r\n\r\n“Receiving so much water continually, does not the sea end by\r\noverflowing, like a basin, when it is too full?”\r\n\r\n“You are out in your reckoning, my dear child. The Rhone is not the only\r\nriver that goes to the sea. In France alone there are the Garonne,\r\nLoire, Seine, and many less important ones. And that is only a very\r\nsmall part of the streams that flow into the sea. All the rivers in the\r\nworld join it, absolutely all. The Amazon, in South America, is 1400\r\nleagues long, and ten leagues wide at its mouth. What an immense\r\nquantity of water it must furnish!\r\n\r\n“Imagine that all the streams in the world, small as well as large, the\r\ntiniest brooks no less than the enormous rivers, flow unceasingly into\r\nthe sea. You know the little brook with the crabs. In certain places\r\nEmile can jump across it; scarcely anywhere is the water over his knees.\r\nWell, the brook goes to the sea exactly as the Amazon does; every second\r\nit casts its few liters of water into it; that is all it can do. But it\r\ndoes not dare, tiny little stream, to make the voyage alone and go and\r\nfind the sea, the immense sea, all by itself. It meets company on the\r\nway, joins its thread of clear water to stronger streams which become\r\nrivers by joining their forces; the sea-going-river receives tributary\r\nstreams, and the sea, in receiving the river, drinks the tiny brook.”\r\n\r\n“All running waters,” said Jules, “brooks, torrents, streams, rivers,\r\nrun into the sea without a break, and that takes place all over the\r\nworld, so that every second the sea receives incalculable volumes of\r\nwater. So I come back to Emile’s question: How is it that, continually\r\nreceiving so much water, the sea does not overflow?”\r\n\r\n“If, when full, a reservoir receives from a spring just as much as it\r\nlets out through some opening, can this reservoir overflow, even when\r\nwater is always coming in?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not: losing as much as it receives, it must always keep the\r\nsame level.”\r\n\r\n“It is the same with the sea. It loses just as much as it gains, and\r\ntherefore its level always remains the same. Brooks, torrents, streams,\r\nrivers, all run into the sea; but brooks, torrents, streams, and rivers\r\nalso come from the sea. They carry back to the immense reservoir what\r\nthey took from it, and not a drop more.”\r\n\r\n“If the crab brook comes from the sea,” interposed Emile, “as you say,\r\nits water ought to be salt; but I know very well it is not, in the\r\nleast.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly it is not salt; but the brook does not come out of the sea as\r\nthe water of a ditch comes from a reservoir. In coming from the sea,\r\nbefore becoming what it is, the brook has first passed through the air\r\nas clouds.”\r\n\r\n“As clouds?”\r\n\r\n“As clouds, my little friend. Let us recall something I told you a while\r\nago.\r\n\r\n“The heat of the sun causes water to evaporate; it reduces it to\r\nsomething invisible, to vapor that is dissipated in the air. Seas\r\npresent a surface three times that of the dry land. Over these\r\nimmensities there is constantly taking place an enormous evaporation,\r\nraising into the air a part of the waters of the sea. The vapor thus\r\nformed becomes clouds; the clouds are borne in all directions, letting\r\ndown snow and rain; this rain and melted snow penetrate the ground,\r\nfilter down and give birth to springs, which gradually, by their union,\r\nbecome brooks, streams, and rivers.”\r\n\r\n“I see why the water of brooks is not salt,” said Jules, “although it\r\ncomes from the sea. When you put salt water in a plate in the sun, only\r\nthe water goes away; the salt remains. The vapor that rises from the sea\r\nis not salt, because the salt does not go with it when it forms. So\r\nstreams fed by snow and rain that fall from the clouds cannot be salt.”\r\n\r\n“What you have just told us is very remarkable, Uncle,” observed Claire.\r\n“All water-courses, rivers, streams, torrents, brooks, come from and\r\nreturn to the sea.”\r\n\r\n“They come from the sea, an inexhaustible reservoir that covers with its\r\nwaters a surface three times larger than that of all the continents\r\njoined together; from the sea, whose abysses go down at some places to\r\nthe depth of 14 kilometers, and receive unceasingly the tribute of all\r\nthe water-courses of the world, without ever being taxed beyond their\r\ncapacity. The enormous surface of the sea furnishes the air with vapor\r\nwhich turns into clouds; later these clouds dissolve in rain and, chased\r\nby the wind, travel like immense watering-pots over the ground,\r\nrendering it fertile. In their turn, rain and snow, precipitated by the\r\nclouds, give birth to the rivers that carry their waters to the sea. In\r\nthat way a continual current is effected which, starting from the sea,\r\nreturns to the sea, after having traveled through the atmosphere in the\r\nform of clouds, watered the earth as rain, and crossed continents as\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n“The sea is the common reservoir of the waters. Rivers, springs,\r\nfountains, every little brooklet, all come from and all return to it.\r\nThe water of a dewdrop, the water that circulates in the sap of plants,\r\nthe water that forms beads of perspiration on our foreheads, all come\r\nfrom the sea and are on their way back to it. However small the little\r\ndrop, do not fear that it will lose its way. If the arid sand drinks it\r\nup, the sun will know how to draw it out again and send it to rejoin the\r\nvapor in the atmosphere and, sooner or later, to reënter the\r\nocean-basin. Nothing is lost, nothing escapes the eye of God, who has\r\nmeasured the oceans in the hollow of His hand, and knows the number of\r\ntheir drops of water.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXVI\r\n\r\n                               THE SWARM\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE PAUL was still talking when they heard a persistent noise in the\r\ngarden: _pom! pom! pom! pom!_ as if some smith had set up his anvil\r\nunder the big elder-tree. They ran to see what it was. Jacques was\r\ngravely tapping with a key on the watering can: _pom! pom! pom! pom!_\r\nMother Ambroisine was busily beating a copper saucepan with a small\r\nstone: _pom! pom! pom! pom!_\r\n\r\nHave our two good servants lost their heads, that they are giving\r\nthemselves up, with the most serious air in the world, to this\r\ncharivari? Without suspending their singular occupation, they exchange a\r\nfew words. “They are going toward the currant-bush,” says Jacques. “They\r\nlook as if they were going away,” answers Mother Ambroisine; and the\r\n_pom! pom! pom! pom!_ is resumed.\r\n\r\nJust then Uncle Paul and his nephews and niece come up. One glance is\r\nenough to explain everything to Uncle Paul. Over the garden there is a\r\nkind of red smoke flying, which sometimes rises and sometimes sinks,\r\nsometimes scatters and sometimes comes together in a compact mass. A\r\nmonotonous whirring of wings proceeds from the midst of the red smoke.\r\nJacques and Mother Ambroisine, still tapping, follow the cloud. Uncle\r\nPaul looks on, greatly preoccupied. Emile, Jules, and Claire look at\r\neach other, surprised at what is going on.\r\n\r\nThe little cloud descends, it approaches the currant-bush, as Jacques\r\nhad foreseen, passes around it, examines it, chooses a branch. And now\r\n_pom! pom! pom! pom!_ louder than ever. On the branch selected a round\r\nmass is formed, visibly increasing while the cloud, less and less\r\ncompact, whirls around. Jacques and Mother Ambroisine stop tapping. Soon\r\nthere hangs from the branch of the currant-bush a large bunch, from\r\nwhich the last comers of the living cloud depart to return an instant\r\nlater. All is over; one can now approach.\r\n\r\nEmile, who suspects it is bees, would like to return to the house. His\r\nold misadventure with the hive has left him with lively remembrances. To\r\nreassure him his uncle takes him by the hand. Emile bravely approaches\r\nthe currant-bush. What risk can he run with his uncle? Jules and Claire\r\ncome close also; it is worth the trouble.\r\n\r\nNow, on the currant-bush hangs a bunch of bees, all close together. Some\r\nbelated ones come from here and there, choose a good place, and cling on\r\nto the preceding ones. The branch bends under the burden, for there are\r\nseveral thousands on it. The first arrivals, doubtless the most robust,\r\nsince they will have to support the whole load, have seized the branch\r\nwith the claws of their forefeet; others have come and fastened\r\nthemselves to the hind feet of the first bees, and in their turn have\r\nserved as suspension points to a third rank; then, gradually, to a\r\nfourth, fifth, sixth, and more still, meantime diminishing in number,\r\nuntil finally they are all clinging there by their hands, as one might\r\nsay. The children stand in wonder before the bunch of bees, whose red\r\ndown and lustrous wings shine in the sun; but they prudently keep at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n“Do we not run the risk of being stung by getting so near?” Jules asked.\r\n\r\n“In their present condition bees rarely make use of their sting. If you\r\nfoolishly went and tormented them, I would not answer for their conduct;\r\nbut leave them alone, and you can watch them at your ease, without any\r\nfear. They have other cares now than thinking of stinging little curious\r\nboys!”\r\n\r\n“And what cares? They look very peaceful; one would say they were all\r\nasleep.”\r\n\r\n“The grave cares of a people who have no country and seek to create one\r\nfor themselves.”\r\n\r\n“Bees have a country, then?”\r\n\r\n“They have a hive, which amounts to the same thing for them.”\r\n\r\n“Then they are looking for a hive to live in?”\r\n\r\n“They are looking for a hive.”\r\n\r\n“And where do these homeless bees come from?”\r\n\r\n“They come from the old hive in the garden.”\r\n\r\n“They might have stayed there, instead of going out to seek their\r\nfortunes.”\r\n\r\n“They could not. The population of the hive increased, and there was not\r\nroom enough for all. So the most adventurous, under the guidance of a\r\nqueen, expatriated themselves to found a colony elsewhere. The\r\nemigrating troop is called a swarm.”\r\n\r\n“The queen who leads the swarm—she must be there in the common bunch?”\r\n\r\n“She is. It is she who, alighting on the currant-bush, determined the\r\nhalt of the entire company.”\r\n\r\nThese words, country, queen, emigrants, colony, had impressed the\r\nchildren’s imaginations; they were astonished to hear the terms of human\r\npolitics applied to bees. Questions came one after another, but Uncle\r\nPaul turned a deaf ear.\r\n\r\n“Wait until the swarm is gathered into the hive, and I will tell you at\r\nlength the splendid story of the bees. At present I will only answer\r\nClaire’s question as to why Jacques and Mother Ambroisine tapped on the\r\nwatering-pot and the saucepan.\r\n\r\n“If the swarm had flown off into the country, it would have been lost to\r\nus. It was necessary to induce it to alight on a tree in the garden and\r\nthere form itself into a bunch. It has always been thought that this\r\nresult could be obtained by making a noise. Thus the sound of thunder is\r\nimitated and, as it is said, the bees, afraid of the perils of an\r\napproaching storm, quickly seek refuge. I do not believe bees are silly\r\nenough to fear a storm because of this tapping on an old pot. They\r\nalight where they please, when they please, and not far from the old\r\nhive, provided the place suits them.”\r\n\r\nJacques, with a saw in one hand and a hammer in the other, called to\r\nUncle Paul. With some new boards he was going to make a house for the\r\nswarm. By evening the hive was ready. At the bottom were three little\r\nholes for the bees to go in and out, and inside some pegs for holding\r\nthe future honey-combs. A large flag-stone had been placed against the\r\nwall for the hive to stand on. At night-fall they went to the\r\ncurrant-bush. The bunch of bees was put into the hive, and a few shakes\r\ndetached it from the branch. Finally the hive was put in place on its\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Jules watched to see what the bees were doing. The\r\nhouse had suited them. They were to be seen coming, one by one, out of\r\nthe little doors of the hive, rubbing themselves a moment in the sun on\r\nthe flag-stone, and then flying away to the flowers in the garden. They\r\nwere at work. The colony was founded. At a grand council they had\r\ndecided matters during the night.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXVII\r\n\r\n                                  WAX\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was not necessary to remind Uncle Paul of his promise. He took\r\nadvantage of the first leisure moment to tell the children the story of\r\nthe bees.\r\n\r\n“A well-peopled hive contains from twenty to thirty thousand bees. That\r\nis about the population of our secondary towns. In a town all cannot\r\nfollow the same trade. Bakers make bread, masons houses, carpenters\r\nfurniture, tailors clothes; in short, there are artisans for every\r\noccupation. In like manner, in the social economy of the beehive, there\r\nare various divisions; namely, that of the mothers, that of the fathers,\r\nand that of the workers.\r\n\r\n“For the first, there is only one bee in each hive. This bee, mother of\r\nthe whole population, is called the queen. She is distinguished from the\r\nworkers by a large body and the absence of working implements. Her\r\nbusiness is to lay eggs. She has as many as twelve hundred at a time in\r\nher body, and others keep on forming as fast as the first are laid. What\r\na formidable business is the queen’s! But then, what respectful\r\nattentions, what tender care the other bees show to their common mother!\r\nThey feed the noble mother by the mouthful; they give her of the best,\r\nfor she has not time to gather for herself, and, to tell the truth,\r\nwould not know how to do it if she had. To lay and lay is her one and\r\nonly function.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drone]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The business of father falls to six or eight hundred idlers called\r\ndrones. They are larger than the workers and smaller than the queen.\r\nTheir large bulging eyes join together on the top of the head. They have\r\nno sting. Only the queen and the workers have the right to carry the\r\npoisoned stiletto. The drones are deprived of this weapon. One asks,\r\nwhat use are they? One day they form a retinue of honor to the queen,\r\nwho takes a fancy to fly through the air; then hardly anything more is\r\nheard of them. They perish miserably in the open, or, if they return to\r\nthe hive, are coldly received by the workers, who look at them unkindly\r\nfor exhausting the provisions without ever adding to them. At first they\r\ntreat them to some smart blows to show them that idlers are not wanted\r\nin a working society; and if they fail to understand, a resolution is\r\ntaken. One fine morning they kill every one of them. The bodies are\r\nswept out of the hive, and that’s the end of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Worker]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now come the workers, about twenty or thirty thousand bees to one\r\nqueen. These are called working-bees. They are the ones you see in the\r\ngarden flying from one flower to another, gathering the harvest. Other\r\nworkers, a little older and consequently more experienced, remain in the\r\nhive to look after the housekeeping and to distribute nourishment to the\r\nnurslings hatched from the eggs laid by the queen. There are, then, two\r\nbodies of workers to be distinguished: the wax-bees, younger, which make\r\nwax and gather the materials for honey; the nurses, older, which stay at\r\nhome to bring up the family. These two kinds of workers are not mutually\r\nexclusive. When young, full of ardor, adventurous, the bee follows the\r\ntrade of wax-maker. It goes to the fields, seeking viands, visits the\r\nflowers, or sometimes is forced to assert itself and unsheath its sting,\r\nto put to flight some evil-intentioned aggressor; it sweats wax to make\r\nthe storehouse and the little rooms where the brood of young ones is\r\nkept. Growing older, it gains experience, but loses its first ardor.\r\nThen it stays at home, turns nurse, and occupies itself with the\r\ndelicate task of rearing the young.”\r\n\r\nThis preamble of Uncle Paul’s, defining the three industrial classes of\r\nthe bees, appeared to interest the children greatly, and they were\r\nsurprised to find that insects have such marvelously elaborate social\r\nlaws. At the very first opportunity Jules began questioning his uncle.\r\nThe impatient child wanted to know everything at once.\r\n\r\n“You say the wax-bees make wax. I thought they found it ready-made in\r\nflowers.”\r\n\r\n“They do not find it ready-made. They make it, sweat it, that is the\r\nword, as the oyster sweats the stone of his shell, as the meleagrina\r\nsweats the substance of its mother-of-pearl and its pearls.\r\n\r\n“If you look closely at a bee’s stomach, you will see it is composed of\r\nseveral pieces or rings fitting into each other. The stomach of all\r\ninsects has, moreover, the same formation. This arrangement of several\r\nparts fitted endwise is found in the horns or antennæ, as well as in the\r\nlegs, of all insects without exception. It is precisely to this division\r\ninto separate pieces fitted endwise that the word insect alludes, its\r\nmeaning being _cut in pieces_. Is not the body of an insect composed, in\r\nfact, of a series of pieces placed end to end?\r\n\r\n“Let us come back to the bee’s stomach. In the fold separating one ring\r\nfrom the next there is found, underneath, in the middle of the stomach,\r\nthe wax-producing mechanism. There, little by little, the waxy matter\r\noozes out, just as with us sweat oozes through the skin. This matter\r\naccumulates in a thin layer which the insect detaches by rubbing the\r\nstomach with its legs. There are eight of these wax-producers. When one\r\nis idle, another is working; so that the bee always has some layer of\r\nwax at its disposal.”\r\n\r\n“And what does the bee do with its wax?”\r\n\r\n“It builds cells, that is to say storehouses, where the honey is\r\npreserved, and little rooms where the young bees in the form of larvæ\r\nare raised.”\r\n\r\n“It builds its house, then,” put in Emile, “with the layers of wax taken\r\nfrom the folds of its stomach. And there, you see, the bee shows a very\r\noriginal and inventive mind. It is as if, in order to build a house, we\r\nshould rub our sides so as to get from them the blocks of cut stone we\r\nneeded.”\r\n\r\n“The snail,” concluded Uncle Paul, “has already accustomed us to these\r\noriginal ideas of animals. It sweats the stone for its shell.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXVIII\r\n\r\n                               THE CELLS\r\n\r\n\r\n“IN order to store the supply of honey and lodge the larvæ, the bees\r\nbuild with their wax little rooms called cells, open at one end and\r\nclosed at the other. They are six-sided and arranged with perfect\r\nregularity. In geometrical terms, each would be called a hexagonal\r\nprism, or a prism with six facets.\r\n\r\n“Do not be surprised at this introduction of terms belonging to the\r\nbeautiful and severe science of form—of geometry, in short. Bees are\r\ngeometricians of consummate skill. Their constructions have required the\r\nexercise of the highest intelligence. All the power of human reason was\r\nnecessary to follow, step by step, the insect’s science. I will return\r\npresently to this fine subject, a very difficult one, but I will try to\r\nmake it intelligible to you.\r\n\r\n“The cells are placed horizontally, back to back and end to end, in\r\npairs, with the closed ends joining. Furthermore, they are arranged side\r\nby side in greater or less number, and they touch each other by their\r\nflat faces, each one of which serves as partition wall for two\r\ncontiguous cells. The two layers of cells, back to back at their closed\r\nends, constitute what is called a comb or honey-comb. On one side of\r\nthis comb are found all the entrances to the cells of the corresponding\r\nlayer; on the other side the cells of the second layer open. Finally,\r\nthe honey-comb is suspended vertically in the hive, with half its\r\nopenings to the right and half to the left. It adheres by its upper edge\r\nto the roof of the hive, or to the bars that cross it inside.\r\n\r\n“One comb is not enough when the population is numerous; others are\r\nconstructed like the first. The various combs, ranged parallel to one\r\nanother, leave free intervening spaces. These are the streets, the\r\npublic squares, the thoroughfares, on which the openings of the two\r\nlayers of cells belonging to neighboring combs give, as the doors of our\r\nhouses open on the right and left of a street. There the bees circulate,\r\ngoing from one door to another to deposit their honey in the cells used\r\nas storehouses, or to distribute nourishment to the young larvæ lodged\r\none by one in other cells. In these same public places they assemble\r\nwhen necessary, hold consultations, and deliberate on the affairs of the\r\ncommunity. There, for example, among the nurses going from door to door\r\nto see whether the larvæ need feeding, and the wax-bees rubbing\r\nthemselves vehemently to extract the wax and begin to build, is plotted\r\nthe extermination of the drones; there, when the birth of a new queen\r\nmenaces the hive with civil war, the project of emigration ripens.\r\nThere—But let us not anticipate. Let us return to the cells.”\r\n\r\n“I am longing to know the whole of the strange story of the bees,” Jules\r\nbroke in.\r\n\r\n“Patience! First of all let us see how the cells are constructed. The\r\nbee that feels that it is supplied with the materials for making wax\r\nrubs itself and extracts a sheet of wax from the folds of its rings.\r\nWith the little layer of wax between its teeth, that is to say between\r\nits two mandibles, it squeezes through the press of its comrades. ‘Let\r\nme pass,’ it seems to say; ‘see, I have something to work with.’ The\r\ncrowd makes way. The bee takes its place in the middle of the workyard.\r\nThe wax is kneaded between its mandibles, pounded to pieces, then\r\nflattened out into a ribbon, pounded again, and once more kneaded into a\r\ncompact mass. At the same time it is impregnated with a kind of saliva\r\nthat gives it flexibility. When the material is at the proper stage, the\r\nbee applies it bit by bit. To cut off the surplus, the mandibles serve\r\nas scissors; the antennæ, in continual motion, serve it as probe and\r\nmeasuring-compasses; they feel the wall of wax to judge of its\r\nthickness; they plunge into the cavity to find out its depth. What\r\nexquisite touch in this pair of living compasses, to bring to successful\r\ncompletion a construction so delicate and regular! Moreover, if the\r\nworker is a novice, master-bees are there to watch it with an\r\nexperienced eye, to seize on the slightest fault at once and hasten to\r\nremedy it. The maladroit worker modestly steps aside and watches in\r\norder to learn. The trick learned, it sets to work again. With thousands\r\nof wax-bees working together, a comb two or three decimeters wide is\r\noften a day’s work.”\r\n\r\n“You told us,” said Claire, “that the cells are especially remarkable\r\nfor their geometrical arrangement.”\r\n\r\n“I am just coming to that magnificent topic, but I shall treat it\r\nbriefly, I warn you. You are far from being able to follow yet in its\r\nsuperior beauties the architecture of the bees. Yes, my dear Jules, the\r\nwax house of a poor insect, to be well understood, demands knowledge\r\nthat very few persons possess. Ah, you may study ever so long before you\r\nare able fully to understand this marvel! For the present, here is what\r\nI will tell you.\r\n\r\n“The cells serve, some as store-rooms for the honey, others as nests for\r\nthe little ones. They are made of wax, a material that the bees cannot\r\nprocure in indefinite quantities. They must wait until the stomach\r\nsweats a little layer of it, and it forms very slowly, at the expense of\r\nthe insect’s very substance. The bee builds with the materials of its\r\nown body, it impoverishes itself in sweating the wherewithal to\r\nconstruct the cells. You can judge from that how precious a thing wax is\r\nto the bees, and with what strict economy they must use it.\r\n\r\n“And yet the innumerable family must be lodged, honey store-rooms must\r\nmultiply to supply the wants of the community. Moreover, it is necessary\r\nthat these store-rooms and nurseries take up as little room as possible,\r\nso as not to encumber the hive, and to permit free circulation to the\r\ntwenty or thirty thousand inhabitants of the city. In fine, one of the\r\nhardest problems is presented to the bees: they must make the greatest\r\npossible number of cells in the least space and with the least wax\r\npossible. Well, friend Jules, do you think you could solve the bees’\r\nproblem?”\r\n\r\n“Alas! Uncle, I hardly understand the statement of it.”\r\n\r\n“To economize the wax, a very simple way suggests itself at the outset:\r\nit is to make the partitions of the cells very thin. You may be quite\r\nsure the bees are equal to this elementary requirement. They make the\r\nwax walls scarcely as thick as a sheet of paper. But that is not enough:\r\nit is necessary above all to take the form into consideration and to\r\nseek the most economical shape. Let us try. What shape shall we give the\r\ncells to satisfy the conditions of economy in space and wax?\r\n\r\n“First of all let us suppose them to be round. Let us trace on paper\r\nsome circles of equal size and touching one another. Between three of\r\nthese contiguous circles there will always be an unoccupied space. The\r\nround form will not do, then, for the cells, since there will always be\r\na waste of space, or empty intervals.\r\n\r\n“Let us make them square. We will trace equal squares on the paper. In\r\ngoing about it properly we can arrange the squares side by side without\r\nleaving any empty spaces between them. Look at the inlaid floor of this\r\nroom, composed of little square red bricks. These bricks leave no\r\nintervening spaces; they touch on every side. The square form,\r\ntherefore, suits the first condition, namely: to utilize all the space.\r\n\r\n“But here is where another difficulty arises. Cells fashioned on the\r\nsquare model would not hold enough honey for the quantity of wax used in\r\nconstructing them. In order to increase their capacity, you must\r\nincrease as much as possible the number of their facets. I will not try\r\nto demonstrate to you this beautiful truth; it is beyond your\r\nintelligence. Geometry affirms it; let us consider it a fact.\r\n\r\n“Starting from that, the choice is soon made. Among all the regular\r\nfigures that can be placed side by side without leaving an unoccupied\r\nspace, you must choose that which has the greatest number of sides, for\r\nthat is the one that will hold the most honey for the same quantity of\r\nwax used.\r\n\r\n“Geometry teaches that the only regular figures that can be arranged\r\nwithout waste of space are: the three-sided figure, or triangle; the\r\nfour-sided, or square; and the six-sided, or hexagon. That is all: no\r\nother regular figures touch all around so as to leave no empty spaces\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n“So it is, then, in the hexagonal form, or form with six sides, that the\r\ncells can occupy, collectively, the least space, use the least wax, and\r\nhold the most honey. Bees, knowing these things better than any one\r\nelse, make hexagonal cells, never any other kind.”\r\n\r\n“Then bees have reason,” remarked Claire, “like ours; even superior, if\r\nthey can solve such problems?”\r\n\r\n“If bees constructed their cells after a premeditated, considered,\r\ncalculated plan, it would be something alarming, my dear child: animals\r\nwould rival man. Bees are profound geometricians because they work,\r\nunconsciously, under the inspiration of the sublime Geometrician. Let us\r\nstop this talk, which I fear you have not wholly understood; but, at any\r\nrate, I have opened your eyes to one of the greatest wonders of this\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXIX\r\n\r\n                                 HONEY\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE bee is diligent: at sunrise it is at work, far from the hive,\r\nvisiting the flowers one by one. You already know what it is in flowers\r\nthat attracts insects: I have told you about the nectar, that sweet\r\nliquor that oozes out at the bottom of the corolla to entice the little\r\nwinged people and make them shake the anthers on the stigma. This nectar\r\nis what the bee wants. It is its great feast, the great feast also of\r\nthe little ones and the queen-mother; it is the prime ingredient of\r\nhoney. How carry home a liquid so that others may enjoy it? The bee\r\npossesses neither pitcher, jar, pot, nor anything of the sort. I am\r\nwrong: like the ant that carries the plant-lice’s milk to the workers,\r\nit is provided with a natural can, stomach, paunch, or crop.\r\n\r\n“The bee enters a flower, plunges to the bottom of the corolla a long\r\nand flexible trunk, a kind of tongue that laps the sweet liquor. Droplet\r\nby droplet, drawn from this flower and that, the crop is filled. The bee\r\nat the same time nibbles a few grains of pollen. Moreover, it proposes\r\nto carry a good load of it to the hive. It has special utensils for this\r\nwork: first, the down of its body, then the brushes and baskets that its\r\nlegs supply. The down and the brushes are used for harvesting; the\r\nbaskets for carrying.\r\n\r\n“First the bee rolls delightedly among the stamens to cover itself with\r\npollen. Then it passes and re-passes over its velvety body the\r\nextremities of its hind legs, where is found a square piece bristling on\r\nthe inside with short and rough hairs which serve as a brush. The grains\r\nof pollen scattered over the down of the insect are thus gathered\r\ntogether into a little pellet, which the intermediary legs seize in\r\norder to place it in one or other of the baskets. They call by this name\r\na hollow edged with hair on the outside of the hind legs, a little above\r\nthe brushes. It is there the pellets of pollen are piled up as fast as\r\nthe brushes gather them on the powdery down. The load does not fall,\r\nbecause it is held by the hairs that edge the basket; it is also stuck\r\nagainst the bottom. The queen and the drones have not these working\r\nimplements. Utensils are useless to those who do not work.”\r\n\r\n“The little yellow masses one sees on the hind legs of bees visiting the\r\nflowers are loads of pollen contained in the baskets?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. The bee has lapped so much sweet from the corollas, has\r\nbrushed its pollen-powdered sides so often, that finally the crop is\r\nfull and the baskets are running over. It is time to go back to the\r\nhive, time for a flight made heavy with so much treasure.\r\n\r\n“Let us take advantage of the time used in the return journey to inform\r\nourselves about the origin of honey. The bee carries with it a sugary\r\nliquor in its crop, two balls of pollen in its baskets; but all that is\r\nnot yet honey. Real honey the bee prepares with the ingredients that we\r\nhave just seen it gather; it cooks it, lets it simmer in its crop. Its\r\nlittle stomach is better than a real pot for carrying: it is an\r\nadmirable alembic, in which the liquid that has been lapped up and the\r\ngrains of pollen that have been nibbled are worked by digestion and\r\nconverted into a delicious marmalade, which is honey. This skilful\r\ncooking finished, the content of the crop is honey.\r\n\r\n“The bee arrives at the hive. If by good fortune the queen-mother is\r\nencountered, the workman does reverence to her and offers her, from\r\nmouth to mouth, a sip of honey, the first from its crop. Then it seeks\r\nan empty cell, inserts its head into the storeroom, projects its tongue,\r\nand spits out the contents of its stomach; and there you have real honey\r\ndisgorged by the bee.”\r\n\r\n“Is it all disgorged?” Emile asked.\r\n\r\n“Not all. The crop’s contents are usually divided into three parts: one\r\nfor the nurses that remain in the hive to do the housework; a second for\r\nthe little ones still in the nest; a third kept by the bee that has\r\nprepared the honey. Must it not have food in order to work well?”\r\n\r\n“Then bees feed on honey?”\r\n\r\n“Without a doubt. You imagined perhaps that bees made honey expressly\r\nfor man. Undeceive yourself: bees make honey for themselves and not for\r\nus. We plunder their riches.”\r\n\r\n“What becomes of the little balls of pollen?” inquired Jules.\r\n\r\n“The pollen enters into the making of honey, and serves as nourishment\r\nfor the bees. The working bee, on its return from harvesting, puts its\r\nhind legs into a cell where there is neither larva nor honey, and with\r\nthe end of its middle legs it detaches the pellets and pushes them to\r\nthe bottom. In repeating its trips it ends by filling both the cell in\r\nwhich the honey is disgorged and that in which the pollen is stored. The\r\nnurses draw on these provisions when they go from cell to cell,\r\ndistributing small portions to the little ones; thence also they get\r\ntheir own food; in fact, the whole population finds its resources there\r\nwhen bad weather comes.\r\n\r\n“Flowers do not last all the year, and, moreover, there are days of\r\nrest, rainy days when the bees cannot go out. It is necessary,\r\ntherefore, to have pollen and honey in reserve, and to have a good\r\nsupply. So, when flowers are plenty and the harvest exceeds immediate\r\nrequirements, the workers gather honey and pollen untiringly and store\r\nit in cells, which they close, as soon as full, with a cover of wax.\r\n\r\n“These are reserve supplies, safeguards for the future in case of\r\nscarcity. The wax cover is religiously respected; it would be a state\r\ncrime to touch it prematurely. In time of want the seals are removed and\r\neach one draws from the open comb, but with restraint and sobriety. The\r\ncomb exhausted, they break the seals of another.”\r\n\r\n“How are young bees fed?” was Jules’s next question.\r\n\r\n“When the cells destined to serve as nests are prepared in sufficient\r\nnumber by the wax-bees, the queen-mother goes from one to another,\r\ndragging with much effort her fruitful womb. The nurses form a\r\nrespectful retinue. One egg, one only, is laid in each cell. In a few\r\ndays—from three to six—there comes from this egg a larva, a little white\r\nworm, without legs, bent like a comma. Now begins the nurses’ delicate\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n“They must every day, and several times a day, distribute nourishment to\r\nthe little worms, not honey or pollen in its natural state, but a\r\npreparation of increasing strength such as delicate stomachs need at\r\nfirst. It is, in the beginning, a liquid paste, almost tasteless; then\r\nsomething sweeter; and finally pure honey, nourishment at its full\r\nstrength. Do we offer a slice of beef to a crying baby? No, but milk\r\nfirst and then pap. Bees do the same: they have honey, strong food, for\r\nthe strong; and weaker nourishment, tasteless pap, for the weak. How do\r\nthey prepare these more or less substantial foods? It would be hard to\r\nsay. Perhaps they mix pollen and honey in different proportions.\r\n\r\n“In six days the larvæ, called _brood-comb_, have attained their\r\ndevelopment. Then, like the larvæ of other insects, they retire from the\r\nworld to undergo metamorphosis. In order to protect its suffering flesh\r\nat the critical moment of its transfiguration, each larva lines the\r\ninside of its cell with silk, and the working-bees close the cell with a\r\ncover of wax. In the silk-lined case the skin is cast off and the\r\npassage to the state of nymph accomplished. Twelve days later the nymph\r\nawakes from the deep sleep of the second birth; it shakes itself, tears\r\nits narrow swaddling-clothes, and comes forth a bee. The wax cover is\r\ngnawed by the inclosed insect as well as by the working-bees lending a\r\nready hand to the resuscitated; and the hive counts one more citizen.\r\nThe new-born bee makes its toilet a little, dries its wings, polishes\r\nits body, and is off to work. It knows its trade without having had to\r\nlearn it: wax-bee in its youth, nurse in its old age.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXXX\r\n\r\n                             THE QUEEN BEE\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE eggs destined to give birth to queens are laid in special cells,\r\nmuch more spacious and solid than those where the working-bees hatch.\r\nTheir shape is, in a general way, that of a thimble. They are fastened\r\nto the edge of the combs and are called royal cells.”\r\n\r\n“When she lays in a large or small cell,” asked Jules, “does the queen\r\nknow whether the egg is that of a queen or of a working-bee?”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Queen Bee]\r\n\r\n\r\n“She does not know, she does not need to know. There is no difference\r\nbetween the queen-eggs and working-bee-eggs. Its treatment alone decides\r\nthe issue for the egg. Treated in a certain manner, the young larva\r\nbecomes a queen, on whom depends the future prosperity of the hive;\r\ntreated in another way, it becomes one of the working people and is\r\nfurnished with brushes and baskets. Bees make their queens at will; the\r\nfirst egg laid would suffice to fill the royal functions worthily, if\r\ntreated with that end in view. And what does not treatment, or\r\neducation, accomplish with us in our tender years? It does not make us\r\nkings or peasants, but honest people, which is better; and scoundrels,\r\nwhich is worse.\r\n\r\n“It need not be said that the bees’ pedagogic methods are not the same\r\nas ours. Man, as much mind as matter, if not more, turns his attention\r\nabove all to the generous impulses of the heart, the noble aspirations\r\nof the soul. With bees education is purely animal, and is governed by\r\nthe dictates of the belly. The kind of food makes either the queen or\r\nthe working-bee. For the larvæ that are to discharge the functions of\r\nroyalty the nurses prepare a special pap, a royal dish of which only\r\nthey know the secret. Whoever eats of it is consecrated queen.\r\n\r\n“This strengthening nourishment brings about a greater development than\r\nusual; for that reason, as I told you, the larvæ destined for royalty\r\nare lodged in spacious cells. For these noble cradles wax is used with\r\nprodigality. No more hexagonal, parsimonious forms, no thin partitions;\r\na large and sumptuously thick thimble. Economy is silent where queens\r\nare concerned.”\r\n\r\n“It is, then, without the actual queen’s knowledge that bees make other\r\nqueens?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend. The queen is excessively jealous, she cannot endure in\r\nthe hive any bee whose presence may bring the slightest diminution to\r\nher royal prerogatives. Woe to the pretenders that should get in her\r\nway! ‘Ah! you come to supplant me, to steal from me the love of my\r\nsubjects!’ Ah, this! Ah, that! It would be something horrible, my\r\nchildren. Read the history of mankind, and you will see what disasters\r\ncrowned heads, brought to bay, can inflict upon nations. But the\r\nworking-bees are strong-minded, they know that nothing lasts in this\r\nworld, not even queens. They treat the reigning sovereign with the\r\ngreatest respect, without losing sight of the future, which demands\r\nother queens. They must have them to perpetuate the race; they will have\r\nthem, whether or no. To this end the royal pap is served to the larvæ in\r\nthe large cells.\r\n\r\n“Now, in the spring, when the working-bees and drones are already\r\nhatched, a loud rustling is heard in the royal cells. They are the young\r\nqueens trying to get out of their wax prisons. The nurses and wax-bees\r\nare there, standing guard in a dense battalion. They keep the young\r\nqueens in their cells by force; to prevent their getting out, they\r\nreinforce the wax inclosures, they mend the broken covers. ‘It is not\r\ntime for you to show yourselves,’ they seem to say; ‘there is danger!’\r\nAnd very respectfully they resort to violence. Impatient, the young\r\nqueens renew their rustling.\r\n\r\n“The queen-mother has heard them. She hastens up in a passion. She\r\nstamps with rage on the royal cells, she sends pieces of the wax covers\r\nflying and, dragging the pretenders from their cells, she pitilessly\r\ntears them to pieces. Several succumb under her blows; but the people\r\nsurround her, encircle her closely, and little by little draw her away\r\nfrom the scene of carnage. The future is saved: there are still some\r\nqueens left.\r\n\r\n“In the meantime wrath is excited and civil war breaks out. Some lean to\r\nthe old queen, others to the young ones. In this conflict of opinions\r\ndisorder and tumult succeed to peaceful activity. The hive is filled\r\nwith menacing buzzings, the well-filled storehouses are given over to\r\npillage. There is an orgy of feasting with no thought of the morrow.\r\nDagger-thrusts are exchanged. The queen decides on a master-stroke: she\r\nabandons the ungrateful country, the country that she founded and that\r\nnow raises up rivals against her. ‘Let them that love me follow me!’ And\r\nbehold her proudly rushing out of the hive, never to enter it again. Her\r\npartizans fly away with her. The emigrating troop forms a swarm, which\r\ngoes forth to found a new colony elsewhere.\r\n\r\n“To restore order, the working-bees that were away during the tumult\r\ncome and join the bees left in the hive. Two young queens set up their\r\nrights. Which of them shall reign? A duel to the death shall decide it.\r\nThey come out of their cells. Hardly have they caught sight of each\r\nother when they join in shock of battle, rear upright, seize with their\r\nmandibles each an antenna of the other, and hold themselves head to\r\nhead, breast to breast. In this position, each would only have to bend\r\nthe end of its stomach a little to plunge its poisoned sting into its\r\nrival’s body. But that would be a double death, and their instinct\r\nforbids them a mode of assault in which both would perish. They separate\r\nand retire. But the people gathered around them prevent their getting\r\naway: one of them must succumb. The two queens return to the attack. The\r\nmore skilful one, at a moment when the other is off guard, jumps on its\r\nrival’s back, seizes it where the wing joins the body, and stings it in\r\nthe side. The victim stretches its legs and dies. All is over. Royal\r\nunity is restored, and the hive proceeds to resume its accustomed order\r\nand work.”\r\n\r\n“The bees are very naughty to force the queens to kill one another until\r\nthere is only one left,” commented Emile.\r\n\r\n“It is necessary, my little friend; their instinct demands it. Otherwise\r\ncivil war would rage unceasingly in the hive. But this hard necessity\r\ndoes not make them forget for one moment the respect due to royal\r\ndignity. What is to prevent their getting rid of the superfluous queens\r\nthemselves, even as they so unceremoniously get rid of the drones? But\r\nthis they are very careful not to do. What one of their number would\r\ndare to draw the sword against their sovereigns, even when they are a\r\nserious encumbrance? The saving of life not being in their power, they\r\nsave honor by letting the pretenders fight it out among themselves.\r\n\r\n“There is always the possibility that the queen, at a time when she is\r\nreigning alone and supreme, may perish by accident or die of old age.\r\nThe bees press respectfully around the deceased; they brush her\r\ntenderly, offer her honey as if to revive her; turn her over, feel her\r\nlovingly, and treat her with all the regard they gave to her when alive.\r\nIt takes several days for them to understand, at last, that she is dead,\r\nquite dead, and that all their attentions are useless. Then there is\r\ngeneral mourning. Every evening for two or three days a lugubrious\r\nhumming, a sort of funeral dirge, is heard in the hive.\r\n\r\n“The mourning over, they think about replacing the queen. A young larva\r\nis chosen from those in the common cells. It was born to be a wax-bee,\r\nbut circumstances are going to confer royalty upon it. The working-bees\r\nbegin by destroying the cells adjacent to the one occupied by the sacred\r\nlarva, the queen that is to be by unanimous consent. The rearing of\r\nroyalty requires more space. This being secured, the remaining cell is\r\nenlarged and shaped like a thimble, as willed by the high destiny of the\r\nnursling it contains. For several days the larva is fed with royal\r\npaste, that sugary pap that makes queens, and the miracle is\r\naccomplished. The queen is dead, long live the queen!”\r\n\r\n“The story of the bees is the best you have told us,” declared Jules.\r\n\r\n“I think so too,” his uncle assented; “that is why I kept it till the\r\nlast.”\r\n\r\n“What—the last?” cried Jules.\r\n\r\n“You are not going to tell us any more stories?” asked Claire.\r\n\r\n“Never, never?” Emile put in.\r\n\r\n“As many as you wish, my dear children, but later. The grain is ripe,\r\nand the harvest will take up my time. Let us embrace, and finish for the\r\npresent.”\r\n\r\nSince Uncle Paul, occupied with his duties in the harvest-field, no\r\nlonger tells stories in the evening, Emile has gone back to his Noah’s\r\nArk. He found the hind and the elephant moldy! From the time of the\r\nstory of the ants the child had suspended his visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ● Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n    ○ Missing or obscured punctuation was corrected.\r\n    ○ Unbalanced quotation marks were left as the author intended.\r\n    ○ Typographical errors were silently corrected.\r\n    ○ Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation were made consistent only\r\n      when a predominant form was found in this book.\r\n    ○ Text in italics is enclosed in underscores (_italics_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Story-book of Science, by Jean-Henri Fabre",
