GILMAN\r\n\r\n           Veterinary Experiment Station, Cornell University\r\n\r\n\r\nNormal reproduction is the fundamental foundation upon which the entire\r\ncattle industry rests. For this reason, any factor capable of\r\ninterfering with it is a detriment to the industry, and a matter of\r\nprime importance to the breeder and the veterinarian. With the relative\r\nincrease in number and value of cattle, and the fact that the profession\r\nis depending more and more on this industry for a livelihood, these\r\nproblems are assuming greater importance. The part played by the bull\r\nhas been emphasized entirely too little, with the result that, as in\r\nhuman medicine, many fail to appreciate the effects of sterility or\r\nlowered fertility in the male. The part played by the sire in the spread\r\nof genital infections, though discussed frequently, has received little\r\nsystematic investigation.\r\n\r\nThe bull mast be regarded as at least half the herd, not only from the\r\nstandpoint of the characters he imprints upon his progeny, but because\r\nof his relation to the reproductive efficiency in the herd. It seems\r\nquite probable that he does disseminate during copulation, infection\r\nassociated with the genital organs, with the result that the bull is a\r\nvery important factor in a study of the subject. Too frequently, his\r\nability to copulate in an apparently normal manner, is taken as a\r\nstandard of fertility. Gross changes in his genitalia, or the absence of\r\nspermatozoa from the semen are given due consideration, while other more\r\nobscure abnormalities are not looked for nor regarded in their proper\r\nlight. Neither fertility nor sterility are always absolute, but the\r\nterms should be used relatively inasmuch as we may have all degrees of\r\ninfertility or impotency. All too frequently we forget the many delicate\r\nand intricate mechanisms involved in the reproductive process, with the\r\nresult that many phases of the problem are neglected or disregarded. The\r\ngenital organs work as a unit, each part of which must function in\r\nperfect accord with the others to the end that full fertility may\r\nresult. The physiological factors involved in the formation of the semen\r\nare too little understood, or at best, our knowledge regarding them is\r\nmore or less hazy.\r\n\r\nThe purposes of the present work have been: (1) to summarize the work so\r\nfar done on the subject, (2) to review briefly the known facts throwing\r\nlight on the anatomy and physiology of the male genital organs, (3) to\r\ncarry our systematic studies upon the pathology and bacteriology of the\r\ngenital tract of the bull, and (4) to ascertain if possible whether the\r\nbull is a disseminator of those infections which interfere with\r\nreproduction in the female.\r\n\r\nThe work has been carried on for the most part from the point of view of\r\na laboratory man cooperating with clinicians. No attempt is made in this\r\npaper to give detailed clinical data, methods for physical examinations,\r\netc. There are included many statements and some data, given in a\r\npreliminary article on the subject. While the subject is broad in its\r\nscope, in fact too broad for great detail, it is hoped that a start has\r\nbeen made toward future and more detailed investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HISTORY\r\n\r\nReferences to, and investigations relating to, the part played by the\r\nbull in the process of reproduction in the herd, and in the spread of\r\ngenital infections, have been limited largely to those phenomena caused\r\nby _Bact. abortum_. Bang (1) originally called attention to the\r\npossibility of the male transmitting the organism discovered by him, but\r\nhe reached no definite conclusion on the subject. James Law (2) writing\r\non contagious abortion in cows, early suspected this possibility when\r\nstating under “casual infections,” that—“In a case which came under the\r\nobservation of the writer recently, a family cow, kept in a barn where\r\nno abortion had previously occurred, was taken for service to a bull in\r\na herd where abortion was prevailing, and though she was only present at\r\nthe latter place for a few minutes, she aborted in the sixth month.”\r\nJansen, as quoted by Sand, reports the case of a cow from an aborting\r\nherd having been taken into a herd that had been previously quite free\r\nfrom the disease. Soon after her arrival she aborted, and later cow\r\nafter cow of the original herd aborted. The owner kept the matter a\r\nsecret, and sent his cow to a neighbor’s bull for service, with the\r\nresult that for two years abortion prevailed among cows served by this\r\nbull. McFadyean and Stockman (3) later, in experimental work, attempted\r\nbut failed to infect cows by using a soiled bull for service. Hadley and\r\nLothe (4) state: “A large number of stockmen hold that the bull is an\r\nimportant factor in the transmission of contagious abortion in herds. A\r\nsmaller number believe that the bull merely acts as a passive carrier of\r\nthe abortion disease and is not actively concerned in the transmission.”\r\nIn a subsequent bulletin, Hadley (5) remarks: “The abortion organisms\r\nmay enter the body ... during sexual intercourse.” In an experiment\r\ncarried on by the same author and co-workers, abortion-free virgin\r\nheifers were mated to abortion-infected bulls, infection being evidenced\r\nby positive reactions to the complement fixation and agglutination\r\ntests. His results indicate, he believes, “that the bull is not so\r\nimportant a factor in transmitting abortion as many believe.” The\r\nconclusions are: “Bulls may become infected with abortion bacilli. Bulls\r\nthat reacted to the blood tests were incapable of disseminating the\r\nabortion disease to the abortion-free heifers with which they were\r\nmated. Bulls appear to possess a sexual or individual immunity to\r\nabortion infection that renders them less susceptible than cows and\r\ninduces a milder form of the disease. The resistance appears to be due\r\nto certain anatomic and physiologic differences in their sexual organs\r\nwhich make them less favorable places for the growth of the abortion\r\ngerms than those of the opposite sex.”\r\n\r\nBuck, Creech, and Ladson (6) applied the agglutination test to 325\r\nmature bulls, of which 288 were negative and 37 positive. _Bacillus\r\nabortus_ was isolated from five animals, of which three showed marked\r\nlesions, two in the seminal vesicles, and one in the left testicle. They\r\nconclude: “_B. abortus_ may involve organs of the generative apparatus\r\nof bulls, producing chronic inflammatory changes. Of the generative\r\norgans, the seminal vesicles appear to furnish the most favorable site\r\nfor the lodgement and propagation of abortion infection.”\r\n\r\nSchroeder and Cotton (7) cite the case of a bull which reacted to the\r\nabortion test and, on post mortem, _Bact. abortum_ was isolated from an\r\nabscess of one epididymis. They state: “Our attempts to produce a\r\nsimilar case of infection artificially failed, and, in agreement with\r\nthe difficulties many investigators have had to obtain incriminating\r\nevidence against bulls, we have thus far failed to infect bulls in any\r\nway that justifies the assumption that they are important factors in the\r\ndissemination of abortion disease.” Further, they conclude: “Regarding\r\nthe dissemination of abortion disease by bulls, we may say, however,\r\nthat it would be foolhardy in the dim light of our present knowledge to\r\ntake liberties with reacting bulls, or bulls from infected herds, or\r\npromiscuously used bulls.”\r\n\r\nCotton (8) failed to demonstrate the presence of abortion bacilli in the\r\ngenital organs of the bull used to serve aborting cows, or in the\r\ntesticles of two bull calves, one of which had been fed and the other\r\ninjected with the cultures of the abortion bacillus. He concludes that\r\nthe bull does not harbor the organisms in the testicles. Carpenter (9)\r\ninjected both _streptococci_ and _Bact. abortum_ into the scrotal sacs\r\nof young calves, and intravenously in others. In no case was he able to\r\nrecover the organisms from any part of the genital canal, except for a\r\n_streptococcus_ in one instance. Rettger and White (10) were unable to\r\nobtain evidence of the presence of _Bact. abortum_ in three bulls\r\nslaughtered after repeated reactions to the complement fixation and\r\nagglutination tests. The three bulls had been under observation for\r\nthree years, with no conclusive evidence to indicate that they were a\r\nsource of danger to the herds in which they were a part. They believe\r\nthat the bull transmits the infection as a passive carrier.\r\n\r\nAttempts at artificial inoculation by natural channels have failed, with\r\nthe possible exception of McFadyean, Sheather, and Minett (11) who were\r\nable to infect the bull by the prepuce in two cases and by the mouth in\r\none case. The results, however, are by no means conclusive. They\r\nconclude, nevertheless, that cattle of any age of either sex may be\r\ninfected by natural channels with the bacillus of epizootic abortion.\r\n\r\nSchroeder (12) carried out investigations to ascertain the frequency\r\nwith which bulls react to abortion tests, and the frequency with which\r\nlesions chargeable to abortion bacilli occur in the reproductive organs\r\nof reacting bulls. Studies were also pursued which he states\r\nconclusively prove that bulls with infected reproductive organs may\r\nexpel abortion bacilli with the seminal fluid. In the first two\r\nmentioned investigations 325 bulls from a Washington abattoir were\r\ntested, and slaughtered upon reaction. “Approximately ten per cent of\r\nthe bulls reacted, and approximately ten per cent of the reacting bulls\r\nshowed lesions of the reproductive organs from which abortion bacilli\r\nwere isolated.” The value of these studies, he emphasizes, lies not in\r\n“that they give us a measure of the proportion of bulls that react\r\npositively to abortion tests or the proportion of reacting bulls that\r\nare carriers of abortion bacilli,” but in “the fact that they show that\r\nabortion bacillus disease of the bull’s reproductive organs is not a\r\nwholly unique affection which practically may be ignored, but an\r\nimportant condition that must be taken into account in our efforts to\r\ncombat infectious abortion, since it has been proved to be associated\r\nwith contamination of the seminal fluid.” In discussing the method by\r\nwhich infected bulls transmit the organisms to cattle, he believes that\r\nleakage of semen from the penis, or vaginas of cattle after service,\r\ncontaminates the food which subsequently gains entrance to their\r\ndigestive tracts. As the result of a series of experiments, he states:\r\n“... the results fail to justify in the least degree the assumption that\r\ncows are infected with abortion bacilli via their vaginas or uteruses at\r\nthe time of copulation, or that the bull, through copulation, is an\r\nagent in the spread of abortion disease.”\r\n\r\nThe work so far alluded to, has been limited to infection with, and the\r\ntransmission of, _Bact. abortum_ and the lesions associated with such\r\ninfection. The last mentioned author, however, states: “A search for\r\nother specific causes of abortions among cattle has not been neglected,\r\nand bureau investigators could relate at great length stories similar to\r\nthose which investigators have told about microorganisms isolated from\r\nthe products of abortions and the uteruses of cows that have aborted.\r\nBacilli of various kinds, different types of micrococci, and spirilla or\r\nvibrio have been found repeatedly; but when their pathogenicity has been\r\ntested in accordance with widely recognized and accepted and required\r\nbacteriological standards, not one shred of evidence has been obtained\r\nto prove them true etiological factors of bovine abortions. What role\r\nsuch microorganisms may have as causes of the sequellae of infectious\r\nabortions, and of other, possibly, independent, abnormal processes in\r\nthe reproductive organs, is far from clear and merits careful study.”\r\nHadley (5) mentions the fact that: “Unquestionably the male often\r\nbecomes infected with the germs that produce the various secondary\r\ndiseases in the female, which are properly classed under the more\r\ninclusive term ‘abortion disease.’” Also, speaking of the rarity with\r\nwhich the bull acquires abortion infection, he alludes to the fact that\r\nhe may act as a “mechanical carrier of various disease germs from an\r\ninfected to a healthy cow.” Carpenter (9) working on the female genital\r\ntract, comes to the conclusion that, in all probability, the genital\r\norgans are normally free from bacteria. Barney (13) quoting Huet finds\r\nthat bacteria may be present in the seminal vesicles of healthy animals\r\n(horses, cattle, pigs, and laboratory animals). This, he states,\r\ncorresponds with the well recognized findings in other parts of the\r\ngenito-urinary tract, not only in animals, but in man. He (Huet) has\r\nfurther found that in animals dying of acute septicemia, the specific\r\norganism (anthrax, pneumococcus) is to be found in the vesicular\r\nsecretions. Furthermore it was definitely shown that an infection could\r\nbe transmitted to the female during the act of copulation.\r\n\r\nWilliams, W. L. (14), calls attention to the lack of veterinary\r\nliterature relating to the pathology and bacteriology of the male\r\ngenital tract, except as related to infection with _Bact. abortum_.\r\nInfection with other types of bacteria is emphasized, the clinical\r\nrecognition of such, with the accompanying pathological changes, and of\r\nthe numerous phenomena involved in the process of reproduction in the\r\nmale. The semen and its essential germinal elements are taken up with\r\nreference to the entire lack of study devoted to them, and some of the\r\nabnormal changes are described. In a later contribution (15), he takes\r\nup the part played by the bull in the dissemination of genital\r\ninfections and states: “Clinical studies now indicate with great\r\nclearness that the bull is an active spreader of that group of genital\r\ninfections which cause sterility, abortion, and related phenomena.”\r\n\r\nWilliams, W. W. (16), studied the semen with reference to sterility,\r\nemphasizing the importance of its examination in the diagnosis, giving\r\nmethods for collecting samples, staining of sperms, and some of the\r\nabnormalities encountered. The work is fundamental, and should be of\r\ngreat practical importance to all interested in the problem. In a later\r\npaper (17), he brings out a more extended discussion of the question. He\r\nconcludes that the clinical examination is of vital importance, and that\r\nthe efficiency of the semen depends not only upon its physical\r\nproperties but upon the number of spermatozoa that are motile, the\r\ndegree of motility, degree of obligospermia, and the percentage of\r\nimperfect spermatozoa, either deformed or immature. Of forty bulls\r\nexamined, he finds that twenty, or fifty per cent, showed lessened\r\nfertility, and others, aside from this, showed minor changes in the\r\ngenital organs or semen. The same author subsequently takes up the\r\nsubject of reproduction from the viewpoint of both sexes, but\r\nemphasizing infection in the male, and the frequency with which lowered\r\nvitality of the germinal cells occurs. Hopper (18) states: “A diseased\r\nbull may manifest non-fertility or decreased potency in different\r\nways—by repeated service to apparently normal females without\r\nconception, by a high abortion rate in females that have been apparently\r\nnormal, by characteristic infections following the use of any particular\r\nsire, or by abnormalities in the breeding tract noted by rectal or\r\nphysical palpation.”\r\n\r\nThe observations of Williams (19) in a pure bred dairy herd bring out\r\nquite clearly the relation of the bull to the dissemination of genital\r\ninfections. The bulls in this particular herd were abnormal in many\r\nrespects, as demonstrated by pathological changes in their genital\r\norgans, bacterial invasion of the parts, abnormalities of the semen and\r\nspermatozoa, and the probable transmission of infection to the females.\r\nSeveral of the sires from this herd furnished much of the material for\r\nthe early basic work of this investigation. Since then the tracts of\r\nother sires have been worked upon with quite similar or identical\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the work already done, most investigators have considered\r\nthe bull as merely a mechanical carrier of _Bact. abortum_ infection,\r\nthough all are more or less suspicious of his ability to become an\r\nactive spreader. Schroeder, however, states that the organisms are\r\neliminated with the semen, but infection of the female occurs\r\nsecondarily through the digestive tract by contamination of the food\r\nwith the semen. Other investigators bring out fundamental points\r\ndemonstrating the importance of other organisms than the Bang bacillus\r\nand call attention to the need of a more thorough study of the anatomy,\r\nphysiology, and pathology of the male genital tract.\r\n\r\nAny study of the genital organs must of necessity rest fundamentally\r\nupon a thorough knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of those parts.\r\nToo few of us have stopped to consider these questions thoroughly, with\r\nthe result that our ideas on the problem are more or less vague. It is\r\nmuch easier to understand why abnormal spermatozoa occur so frequently,\r\nor changes take place in the semen with death or weakening of the\r\ngerminal elements, if we realize or stop to consider the highly\r\ndifferential process of spermatogenesis, and the various structures\r\nwhich contribute to the formation of the semen. We must come to realize\r\nthat each part of the genital tract is essential to the normal\r\nfunctioning of the whole, and that the genital tract and reproduction\r\nare in turn dependent upon the proper functioning of the entire body.\r\n\r\nWalker (20) emphasizes the importance of a thorough knowledge of\r\nphysiology in stating, “Although the subject of sterility has attracted\r\nthe attention of the medical profession; and although much has been\r\nwritten on its causes and treatment, it cannot be claimed that the\r\npractical results obtained up to the present time are satisfactory, or\r\nthat when consulted for sterility, the medical man of today can hold out\r\nto his patient much more hope of successful treatment than the medical\r\nman of fifty years ago. Our failure in this respect is in the main due\r\nto an ignorance of the physiology of reproduction.”\r\n\r\nTo bring out some of these points, the anatomy of the tract will be\r\nreviewed briefly, together with the physiology of reproduction, and the\r\nvarious factors which should be considered in a study of the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY\r\n\r\nIn origin and early development the ovary and testis are identical. The\r\ngonad and mesonephros or primitive kidney are developed from the\r\nurogenital fold. The gonad first forms as a medio-ventral thickening of\r\nthe fold, which gradually expands until it becomes attached by a mere\r\nstalk. At first, the gland is made up merely of a superficial epithelial\r\nlayer, and an inner epithelial mass, or epithelial nucleus. In the\r\nprocess of development, large primordial germ cells migrate from the\r\nentoderm of the future intestinal canal, and pass through the stalk to\r\nthe gonad. In the case of the male gonad, seminiferous tubules are very\r\ndifficult to make out in embryos smaller than 24 millimeters. Then they\r\nsuddenly differentiate out as solid cords of germ cells, while the\r\nconnective tissue grows in around them. These connective tissue sheaths\r\nunite at the center of the organ to form the anlage of the mediastinum\r\ntestis. The testicular tubules unite and converge toward the hilus,\r\nthere to meet the anlage of the rete. At the mesonephric end of the\r\ntestis, the rete first appears as a collection of cells, differentiating\r\nout from the inner epithelial mass of the gonad. These cells gradually\r\ngrow out to meet the collecting portions of the mesonephric tubules on\r\nthe one hand, and the seminiferous tubules on the other. The rete is\r\nrepresented as cords of cells at first, which in forty millimeter\r\nembryos hollow out to form tubules.\r\n\r\nThe mesonephros, or primitive kidney, early starts to degenerate\r\ncranio-caudally,—the tubules becoming separated into a cranial and\r\ncaudal group. The collecting and secretory parts of the cranial group\r\nseparate, the collecting tubules growing out to meet the rete with which\r\nthey unite to form the efferent ductules of the epididymis. The caudal\r\ngroup of tubules is vestigial and becomes the paradidymis. The\r\nmesonephric duct becomes the vas deferens, connecting as it does with\r\nthe tubules of the epididymis, and emptying into the urethra at Müller’s\r\ntubercle or, as it later becomes, the colliculus seminalis.\r\n\r\nThe seminal vesicles arise as hollow saccules from the dorsal wall of\r\nthe mesonephric duct just as it empties into the urethra. The prostate\r\ndevelops as an outgrowth of the dorsal urethra just posterior to\r\nMüller’s tubercle. The bulbo-urethral glands appear as solid, paired,\r\nepithelial outgrowths from the entoderm of the urogenital sinus.\r\n\r\nMüller’s duct, at first a solid tube growing from the anterior part of\r\nthe mesonephros, and ending at Müller’s tubercle, becomes a hollow tube,\r\nand in the female forms the entire genital tract except for the gonad\r\nand the lower part of the vagina. In the male, the anterior part remains\r\nas the vestigial appendix testis, and the posterior part, as the vagina\r\nmasculina. Ellenberger states, however, that this embryonic structure is\r\nvery seldom seen in the mature bull.\r\n\r\nThe _Male Reproductive Organs_ include the penis and testes, together\r\nwith the excretory passages which connect the testes with the urethral\r\ncanal. These excretory ducts include the epididymis, vas deferens, and\r\nseminal vesicles. Posterior to their termination in the urethra, there\r\nare connected the ducts of the prostate gland and the bulbo-urethral or\r\nCowper’s glands.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTES: The testicles of the bull are relatively large. Varying with the\r\nsize and age of the animal they measure from fourteen to seventeen\r\ncentimeters in length, including the epididymis, and from six to eight\r\ncentimeters in diameter. Each testicle is enclosed within a serous sac,\r\nthe tunica vaginalis, whose visceral layer is very intimately fused with\r\nthe underlying covering of the organ, the tunica albuginea. The tunica\r\nalbuginea is quite thin and consists of connective tissue which is rich\r\nin elastic fibres. Muscular tissue is not present as it is in the case\r\nof many mammals. Inside the tunica, and closely attached to, though\r\nseparated from, the parenchyma by a thin layer of connective tissue, is\r\na layer of very loose connective tissue, which because of its rich\r\nsupply of blood vessels is termed the tunica vasculosa. The parenchyma\r\nis of a yellowish gray color, and of a rather soft consistency. It is\r\nmade up of the seminiferous tubules, rete, and the connective tissue\r\nstroma, the mediastinum testis. On section, the mediastinum appears as\r\nthe center or axis of the entire organ. It is star-shaped, and radiates\r\nconnective tissue septa out into the parenchyma to support and separate\r\nthe tubules. Ellenberger states that the testis of the bull and all\r\nruminants lacks a closed system of interlobular septa, because of the\r\nfeeble development of the connective tissue.\r\n\r\nThe principal blood vessels and rete tubules are found in this\r\nstructure, the function of the latter being to connect the seminiferous\r\ntubules and the efferent tubules of the epididymis. The epithelium of\r\nthe rete is quite irregular,—consisting in places of a single layer; in\r\nothers, of two layers. At some points there are formed groups of several\r\ncells lying over one another, with swollen homogeneous basal cells,\r\nwhich sometimes form projections into the lumen.\r\n\r\nThe interstitial tissue, besides conveying the blood vessels to the\r\norgan, contains many “interstitial cells.” These cells are relatively\r\nsparse in the adult bull, and are comparatively delicate, slightly\r\ngranular, often shuttle-shaped, with a rather small nucleus.\r\nEmbryologically they are derived from a syncitium arising from the\r\nmesothelium of the genital ridge, differentiating out by growth of the\r\ncytoplasm. They contain large quantities of fat, and elaborate the\r\ninternal secretion of the testis. This secretion governs the development\r\nof the secondary sexual characters, and has a profound influence on the\r\ngeneral body metabolism, and development of the skeleton. The\r\ninterstitial cells appear early in embryonic life even before there is\r\nany differentiation of sex, and their greater relative development in\r\nthe fetus is indicative of a future male development. In very young\r\nembryos, the growth is very rapid, followed, however, by a period of\r\natrophy, during which the seminiferous tubules undergo marked\r\ndevelopment. Pende (21) states: “There seems to be an inverse relation\r\nbetween the growth of the tubular and interstitial tissues, as one is\r\nhypoplastic when the other is in full activity.” From birth to the onset\r\nof sexual maturity, which may be called a period of rest for the\r\ntesticle, the cells are few in number. With the accentuation of the\r\nsecondary sexual characters, and the beginning of sexual life, these\r\ncells again increase in number and activity.\r\n\r\nThe parenchyma of the testis consists for the most part of the\r\nseminiferous tubules, which, on account of the courses they take in the\r\ndifferent regions, are divided into groups. The peripheral tubules are\r\nthe much-contorted tubuli contorti. These anastomose to form the much\r\nshorter tubuli recti. These in turn anastomose frequently, uniting to\r\nform the rete testis. The rete proceeds through the mediastinum to form\r\nthe efferent ductules which break through the tunica albuginea to form\r\nthe greater part of the head of the epididymis. The tubuli contorti are\r\nthe longer and more numerous of the tubules, for it is here that\r\npractically all the spermatozoa are produced. The straight tubules are\r\nrelatively so short that they may be regarded more in the light of the\r\nbeginning of the system of excretory ducts.\r\n\r\nThe seminiferous tubules consist of a thin peripheral membrana propria\r\nupon which rests the seminal epithelium, which is made up of the\r\nessential semen forming cells, and the cells of Sertoli. The\r\nspermatogenic cells may be divided into three groups, from within\r\noutward: the peripheral single layer of small cuboidal spermatogonia;\r\none or two rows of large spermatocytes; and three to five rows of\r\nspheroidal spermatids. The cells of Sertoli are more or less of the\r\nsyncitial type,—large in size and irregular in outline. They occur at\r\nvarious intervals between the layers of spermatogenic cells, with their\r\nbases resting upon the membrana propria. Centrally they send out\r\nprotoplasmic processes for variable distances,—some even reaching the\r\nborder of the innermost cell layers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPERMATOGENESIS: In this process, the primary germinal cells, the\r\nspermatogonia, divide to form the primary spermatocytes. Maturation\r\nconsists of two cell divisions of the primary spermatocytes, and these\r\nin turn form four spermatids. During the process, the number of\r\nchromosomes is reduced to half the number characteristic of the species.\r\nThe spermatids then become converted into mature spermatozoa. This mode\r\nof transformation may be seen in Plate I. In the process, the nucleus of\r\nthe spermatid forms a large part of the head: the centrosome divides,\r\npart passing to the extremities of the neck. One centrosome becomes the\r\nanterior, and remains attached to the head, while the other divides to\r\nform the posterior centrosome. The latter is divided into the anterior\r\npart, and the posterior nodule or annular ring. Besides this, the\r\nposterior centrosome becomes elongated to form the axial filament, and\r\nthe cytoplasm forms the sheaths of the neck and tail. The spiral\r\nfilament of the connecting piece is derived from the cytoplasmic\r\nmitochondria. At this time, a large part of the cellular cytoplasm is\r\ncast off. Meanwhile, the spermatozoa sink their heads into the long\r\nprotoplasmic processes of the Sertoli or “nurse” cells which furnish\r\nnutritive material for their complete development. Finally the adult\r\ncells are cast off into the lumen. The structure of the spermatozoa, and\r\na discussion of the semen will be taken up later.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPIDIDYMIS: The epididymis is divided into three parts: the head, body\r\nand tail. The head is made up principally of the lobules formed by the\r\nmuch-coiled efferent ductules proceeding from the rete. The ductules,\r\nabout twelve in number in the bull, unite to form the body, which\r\nremains coiled and runs along the postero-medial part of the testicle to\r\nwhich it is more or less closely attached. To quote Ellenberger (23):\r\n“The transition from the rete into the ductules is gradual, as the\r\ncharacteristic epithelium of the latter (ductules) begins in cavities\r\nwithout walls, and at first, gradually form a wall which is well marked\r\nout as a thin ring of interstitial tissue.... The epithelium of the\r\nductules is in sharp contrast to the rete in that it has a\r\nsingle-layered ciliated columnar epithelium, in which here and there one\r\nfinds round basal cells. The dark and light columnar cells alternate;\r\nthe cilia are often cemented together, and form cone-shaped, homogeneous\r\nappearing protuberances. The secretory activity is quite clearly\r\nobservable. In the light cells one finds secretory globules,\r\naccumulating in rows, sometimes above, other times below, arches of\r\ncells. The secretory droplets pass from the cells into the lumen, and\r\noften lie in irregular layers on the epithelium; also the basal cells\r\nappear swollen and shoved out between the cylindrical cells.” At the\r\nlower extremity of the testicle, the tail is formed, which is globular\r\nin shape, and more or less loosely attached to the testicle. Here the\r\nductules anastomose freely, gradually become less coiled, and end in the\r\nsingle excretory tube, the vas deferens. The epithelium at the tail part\r\nis more or less of the pseudo-stratified columnar, ciliated variety.\r\nOutside this is a membrana propria, a circular muscular layer, and a\r\nconnective tissue coat. The secretory activity is very marked here and\r\none finds much secretion in the lumen, Courrier (24), working on the\r\nbat, suggests that the glandular activity is conditioned by the\r\nsecretion from the interstitial (endocrine) gland. The action of the\r\nsecretion is to dilute the large mass of spermatozoa present, nourish\r\nthem to some extent and also stimulate them to active motility. Stigler\r\n(25) states that the properties of the sperms are modified in the\r\nepididymis; the motility, the ability to resist heat, and other\r\nproperties are augmented, at least in the case of the guinea pig, rat,\r\nand mouse. Some authors state that the sperms first become motile when\r\nin contact with the prostatic secretion, but I have repeatedly examined\r\nthe contents of the tail of the epididymis of the bull, rabbit, and\r\nguinea pig, finding full motility in each case, though the duration is\r\nnot nearly as long as when the sperms are ejaculated in the semen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe VAS DEFERENS is quite narrow (2 mm.) and runs from the tail of the\r\nepididymis to the verumontanum, or colliculus seminalis, where it\r\nempties into the urethra in common with the duct of the vesicle. At\r\nfirst it is lined by epithelium similar to that of the vas epididymis,\r\nbut this changes over into a peculiar low stratified type. Ellenberger\r\ndescribes it as follows: “The epithelium shows a very pronounced basal\r\ncoat. The overlying cell zone shows more (at the most, three) rows lying\r\nover each other of elongated nuclei, while an outline of cell form is\r\nnot ordinarily noticeable, so that it may be spoken of as a syncitium,\r\nand at the same time as a many layered epithelium.” The mucosa forms\r\nlow, broad folds into the lumen. The tunica propria is a thin connective\r\ntissue layer. The submucosa consists of thin connective tissue. Three\r\nmuscular coats are present: an inner thin longitudinal layer, middle\r\ncircular layer, and an outer longitudinal layer. All are more or less\r\nintimately blended, and are surrounded by the adventitia, made up of\r\nconnective tissue, elastic fibres and scattered longitudinal muscle\r\ncells of the internal cremaster muscle. Near the dorsal surface of the\r\nbladder, the ducts come in close apposition, and for ten to twelve\r\ncentimeters dilate to form the ampullae. Here the mucous membrane\r\nbecomes much plicated, forming long folds which anastomose freely. The\r\nfunction of the vas is to convey the spermatozoa and secretions from the\r\nepididymis to the urethra. Disselhorst (26) believes the ampulla acts as\r\na seminal reservoir and states that he has found spermatozoa stored up\r\nin the little pockets in the walls of this structure in animals during\r\nthe rutting time. He suggests, further, that there is a relation between\r\nthe state of development of the ampulla and the time occupied by\r\ncopulation. When the organ is small or absent, as in dogs, cats, and\r\nboars, the coition is a slow process, but when the ampulla is large and\r\nwell developed, as in horses and sheep, the coitus requires a relatively\r\nshort time. Inasmuch as coitus is so rapid in the bull, and the ampulla\r\nis so well developed, it seems as though this function is very probable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SEMINAL VESICLES are very compact glandular structures lying on\r\neither side of the median line, on the dorsal side of the bladder, and\r\nventral to the rectum. In the mature bull they measure ten to twelve\r\ncentimeters in length, four centimeters in width, and about two and\r\none-half to three centimeters in thickness. The glands are distinctly\r\nlobulated, quite tortuous, and are often asymmetrical in size and shape.\r\nThey converge posteriorly, to empty into the urethra at the colliculus\r\nseminalis with the ampulla, in a slightly oval slit in the mucosa.\r\nMicroscopically, the gland is of the anastomosing tubular type, with\r\nvery poorly developed excretory ducts to the glandular cavities.\r\nPosteriorly one finds centrally a few sinus-like narrow excretory\r\npassages, which open into the somewhat larger collecting and excretory\r\nduct. The epithelium is of the simple columnar type and produces a\r\nrelatively large amount of secretion. The gland cavities are surrounded\r\nby a membrana propria, over which is a relatively thick layer of smooth\r\nmuscle. Outside this is a connective tissue covering which sends\r\ntrabeculae or septa in between the lobules. The secretion of the seminal\r\nvesicles is a tenacious albuminous fluid with a slightly yellowish\r\ntinge, all or part of which appears in the ejaculate in the form of\r\nswollen sago-like grains which are soon dissolved following ejaculation\r\nand the liquefaction of the semen. The proteid compounds belong to the\r\ngroup of histones. The secretion is liquid when warm and coagulates when\r\ncold. Some say that the filling of the vesicles serves to excite sexual\r\nfeeling, but this is doubtful in view of the fact that in some animals\r\nthe sexual desire exists before the vesicles are filled. Likewise,\r\nSteinach found that rats, whose seminal vesicles had been removed, still\r\nretained their desire for copulation. The function of the secretion is\r\nto furnish much of the volume to the semen, and in some way it has a\r\ndistinct bearing on fertility, inasmuch as extirpation of the organs in\r\nrats leads to lowered fertility. The vesicles of the bull are in no\r\nsense a store-house for spermatozoa, as is usually understood. Repeated\r\nexaminations in a large number of bulls have led to the finding of\r\nspermatozoa there only in very rare instances. That they serve as a\r\nresorption place for sperms that are not ejaculated is also very\r\nunlikely. Normally, one sees on smear of the vesicles, occasional cells,\r\nleucocytes, lecithin granules, sago bodies, and rarely a few degenerated\r\nspermatozoa.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe COLLICULUS SEMINALIS is a rounded or cone-shaped eminence in the\r\nposterior urethra, upon which the ducts of the seminal vesicles and vasa\r\ndeferentia open. The ducts open separately at the bottom of two narrow\r\nslits, one on each side of the mound, there being no distinct\r\nejaculatory duct as in man. The function of the colliculus or\r\nverumontanum is not definitely known. It is generally believed that the\r\nstructure is made up of blood spaces which become engorged during\r\nerection, causing a blockage of the posterior urethra, which prevents\r\nregurgitation of the semen. Rytina (27), however, demonstrated that the\r\nstructure is not composed of any unusual number of blood vessels or\r\nspaces, and that removal of the organ was not followed by regurgitation\r\nof the semen into the bladder during ejaculation. He believes, and quite\r\nlogically, that its function is to afford a prominence upon which the\r\nducts may empty. The mixture of the thick gelatinous semen with the thin\r\nprostatic secretion must occur at the moment of ejaculation and must be\r\nperfectly homogeneous, otherwise large numbers of the organisms remain\r\nin the thick gelatinous portion of the fluid. The eminence serves this\r\npurpose in that the prostatic ducts which converge toward it, may eject\r\ntheir secretion toward the eminence, producing an admixture more evenly\r\nand quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSTATE: The bull possesses what Ellenberger calls a diffuse prostate.\r\nThat is, there is no distinct glandular body as in man. It is composed\r\nprincipally of a glandular sheath around the urethral wall. Just\r\nposterior to the neck of the bladder, and in front of the urethral\r\nmuscle, there is formed a slight dorsal transverse elevation, extending\r\ndownward on the sides. This is what might be termed the body. The\r\ngreater part of the gland is “disseminate” in form, being a sheath of\r\nglandular tissue embedded in the urethral wall. Dorsally it is about ten\r\nto twelve millimeters thick, and ventrally about two millimeters. The\r\ngland is a branched tubular structure, the interlobular tissue of which\r\ncontains much unstriped muscle. The lobules are lined by a columnar type\r\nof epithelium. The ducts, about thirty to forty in number, open into the\r\nurethra in two rows posterior to the colliculus. The secretion is a\r\nthin, slightly turbid fluid, of a faintly alkaline reaction. Its\r\nfunction is to dilute the semen, stimulate the motility of the\r\nspermatozoa and nourish them.\r\n\r\nFish (28) believes that the activating property of the secretion is due\r\nto enzymes, because boiling deprives the fluid of its power to\r\naccelerate the motility of the spermatozoa. Serrlach and Pares, quoted\r\nby Marshall (29), working on dogs, have adduced evidence indicating that\r\nthe prostate is an internal secretory gland which controls the\r\ntesticular functions, and regulates the process of ejaculation. It is\r\nstated that if the prostate is removed, spermatozoa are no longer\r\nproduced in the testis, and that the secretory activity of the accessory\r\ngenital glands ceases. These changes, however, can be prevented by the\r\nadministration of extracts of the prostate. The fact that the prostate\r\nelaborates a secretion having a definite relation to the testis, has\r\nbeen verified by other authors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWPER’S GLANDS (Bulbo-Urethral): These glands are paired, oval\r\nstructures about one and one-half by two and one-half centimeters in\r\nsize, situated on either side of the dorsal pelvic part of the urethra\r\nclose to the ischial arch. They are deeply embedded, with the bulbus\r\nurethae, in the bulbo-cavernosus muscle, thereby being inaccessible to\r\npalpation. In general, they are of a well developed anastomosing tubular\r\ntype. The connective tissue stroma is relatively thin, and thickens only\r\nin between the larger lobules, where one finds the larger collecting\r\nducts. Each gland opens by a single duct. The epithelium is of the\r\nsimple cuboidal type. Little is known of the function of its secretion,\r\nthough Kingsbury (30) regards it in the light of a mating gland; that\r\nis, it lubricates the genital passages during coitus, as does its\r\nhomologous structure in the female, Bartholin’s gland.\r\n\r\nEllenberger describes the urethra, slit ventrally, as presenting the\r\nfollowing picture: “The colliculus seminalis distinctly appears as a\r\nprocess or offshoot of the crista urethralis of the Trigonium Vesicae.\r\nAt the summit, and at the bottom of the two slits, open laterally the\r\nducts of the vesicles, and medially the ductus deferens.... From the\r\ncaudal slope of the colliculus go two distinct mucous membrane folds\r\nwhich run through the entire pelvic urethra, near together, somewhat\r\ndiverging, and then coming together, so that they form an elongated,\r\nnarrow oval. At their caudal union, the excretory ducts of the\r\nbulbo-urethral glands open side by side. At the point of departure of\r\nthe folds from the colliculus, arises a niche-shaped opening, between\r\nboth folds, and likewise lateral to each fold. In these niches open the\r\nducts of the prostate. The openings of the disseminate prostate lie in\r\nrows as in the horse, but form not less than six rows. There is one row\r\nmedial to each fold, and two lateral. Mullet mentions only the medial\r\nrows. These rows extend to the opening of the ducts of Cowper’s glands.\r\nThe stratum glandulare (disseminate prostate) is very easy to recognize\r\nwith the naked eye.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN: The semen is the mixed product of the testicles, their excretory\r\npassages, and the accessory sexual glands, a fact which complicates its\r\nstudy considerably. The freshly ejaculated fluid is cloudy, tenacious,\r\nmore or less coagulable, and is rich in albumen. It is weakly alkaline\r\nin reaction, and contains eighty to ninety per cent of water. Of the\r\nsolid constituents, there is forty per cent of ash, of which\r\nthree-fourths is calcium phosphate. Besides the spermatozoa, the semen\r\nfrequently contains epithelial cells, leucocytes, concentric amyloid\r\nconcretions, and lecithin bodies. When cold, the characteristic\r\nphosphoric acid salts are precipitated. The fluid content is the product\r\nof the tubules of the testicles, their excretory ducts, and the\r\naccessory sexual glands. The characteristic odor of the semen is\r\nsupplied by a slimy nucleoalbumen “spermin” which forms the spermatic\r\ncrystals, and is furnished by the prostatic secretion.\r\n\r\nDuring ejaculation the spermatozoa and secretions added by the testicle\r\nand epididymis are probably carried to the ampulla by peristaltic\r\nmuscular action, in the earlier stages of the orgasm. At the height of\r\nthe orgasm, the ampulla is emptied into the posterior urethra in common\r\nwith the secretion of the contracting vesicles, here to be admixed with\r\nthe thin prostatic secretion. The entire mixture is then propelled, and\r\nejaculation produced by strong muscular contractions of the entire\r\nurethra. As was stated before, the semen is the product of the\r\ntesticles, the excretory ducts, and the accessory sexual glands. The\r\ntestes furnish the essential germinal elements, the sperms, and some of\r\nthe fluid content. Then is added the product of the epididymis, vas, and\r\nampulla, which stimulates the spermatozoa to active motility, nourishes\r\nthe organisms, and adds somewhat to the fluid bulk of the secretion.\r\n\r\nStigler (25) states: “During its sojourn in the epididymis, the\r\nproperties of the spermatozoa are modified; the motility, ability to\r\nresist heat, and other properties are augmented, at least in the case of\r\nthe guinea pig, rat, and mouse.” To the secretion is then added the\r\nproduct of the vesicles, which contributes markedly to its fluid\r\ncontent, nourishes the sperms, and supplies the ferment which induces\r\nclotting of the semen when ejaculated. This is very important because\r\nthe clot formed in the vagina protects the delicate spermatozoa from the\r\nhostile acid vaginal secretion. The prostate likewise adds bulk and\r\nnourishing substances, besides stimulating the spermatozoa to fuller and\r\nmore lasting motility. The addition of the spermin is perhaps\r\nunimportant. The function of the secretion of the Cowper’s glands, which\r\nis added at this time, is problematical. It does, however, have a\r\ndiluting action on the semen. Perhaps its secretion is poured out prior\r\nto ejaculation so as to lubricate the canal and prepare the way for the\r\nsemen.\r\n\r\nFish (28) has demonstrated by means of darkfield illumination, the\r\npresence of numerous minute particles or ultraparticles in this fluid.\r\nTheir character and significance are matters of conjecture, but it would\r\nseem as though they were not identical with the “chylomicrons” or fat\r\nparticles found in the blood by Gage. Perhaps further researches will\r\nreveal some intimate connection between the number present in a field,\r\nand the relative potency of the animal.\r\n\r\nEach portion of the tract furnishes some essential element to the mixed\r\nproduct which is so remarkably adapted both as a vehicle for the\r\nejaculation of the spermatozoa, and as a fluid in which their motility\r\nis initiated and maintained. Any derangement of one part is fraught with\r\ndanger to the existence of viable spermatozoa, and the continuation of\r\nfull fertility on the part of the animal. The physiology of each\r\ncontributing gland must be borne in mind at all times. Walker (31)\r\ninvestigated the fertility of the semen of the dog, taken from various\r\nparts of the tract. His results were: (1) semen from the testicle and\r\nhead of the epididymis showed no motility, (2) semen from the tail of\r\nthe epididymis showed some motility in the more fluid contents of the\r\npreparations, (3) semen from the vas deferens appeared about the same,\r\n(4) a mixture of epididymis semen and prostatic secretion showed active\r\nmotility, and (5) likewise in a mixture of epididymis semen, though only\r\nin those places where the fluids had become well mixed. My observations,\r\nhowever, differ in one respect with regard to the bull, as I have found\r\nfull motility of the spermatozoa from the epididymis, but it is not so\r\nlasting as when augmented by the addition of the prostatic fluid.\r\nBoettcher (32) concludes: “that the secretion of the accessory male\r\ngenital organs possesses a protective colloid, which (1) hinders the\r\nspermatozoid action of the vaginal secretion, at least until the sperms\r\nhave time to reach the interior of the uterus which is an alkaline\r\nreaction, (2) that it makes the ejaculate more voluminous, so that by\r\ncohabitation, a very good part of the vagina becomes moistened, and the\r\nspermatozoa become distributed over the greater part of the vaginal\r\nmucosa. This distribution is rendered necessary because some of the\r\nfluid flows from the vagina following coitus. In this manner the\r\nopportunity is given for a part of the ejaculate containing the\r\nspermatozoa to be brought easier to the external os, and (3) it happens\r\nthat because of its content of sodium chloride the life of the\r\nspermatozoa is stimulated and prolonged.” A fuller discussion of the\r\nessential physiology of the various parts of the tract on the semen\r\ncontent, and fertility, will be taken up later. The changes in\r\nbiochemical content, reaction, and the result of the addition of\r\nbacterial products will also be more fully discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPERMATOZOA: The history of the discovery of spermatozoa is very\r\ninteresting, and for that reason a brief outline will be given. The\r\n“semen threads” were first observed in the year 1667, by Ham, a student\r\nof Leeuwenhoek at Leyden. The discovery was announced, confirmed by\r\nfindings in the dog and rabbit, and discussed by the latter author under\r\nthe title: Observationes Anthonii L. de natis e semine genitali\r\nanimaculis (Upon the formation of young from procreative material). The\r\nsperms were taken to be animals on account of their motility, and their\r\nsignificance remained questionable if not unknown. Spallanzani, quoted\r\nby Marshall (29), was the first to show that the filtered fluid was\r\nimpotent, and that spermatozoa in the semen were essential to\r\nfertilization. Kolliker, in 1841, discovered that the sperms arise from\r\nthe cells of the testis, and Barry in 1843, observed the conjugation of\r\nsperm and ovum in the rabbit. This led to a clear understanding of the\r\nfunction of these important germinal elements.\r\n\r\nThe spermatozoa are the male procreative cells, and are characterized by\r\nthe possession of a head containing the chromosomes necessary for\r\nfertilization, and a tail capable of propelling the organism on its way\r\nto meet the ovum. The length of the entire sperm, including the head, is\r\nseventy-five to eighty microns. The head is nine and five-tenths microns\r\nlong, and five and five-tenths microns wide. It may be divided into two\r\nprincipal parts, the head and tail. The head, for the larger part, is\r\nmade up of the nucleus, and may be differentiated by staining reactions\r\ninto a darker staining posterior part, an anterior lighter part, and\r\noften a still lighter area between the two. On the anterior part is a\r\nsharpened edge, the acrosome, which serves to perforate the ovum. The\r\nwhole is surrounded by a very definite limiting membrane which often\r\nbecomes obscured under abnormal conditions. The tail may be divided into\r\nthree parts: connecting piece, principal part, and terminal filament.\r\nThe connecting piece, the essential motile apparatus, is the thickest\r\nand strongest part, and joins the tail proper to the head. It consists\r\nof the central axial filament, a spiral filament around this, and an\r\nouter mitochondrial covering. Anteriorly it is limited by the anterior\r\nportion of the posterior chromosome, and posteriorly by the annular\r\nchromosome. The anterior chromosome is directly connected with the head,\r\nthere appearing a light break here at the neck where separation\r\nfrequently occurs. This neck serves as a joint for the motion. The axial\r\nfilament, therefore, does not reach the head, but extends back from the\r\nanterior part of the posterior chromosome. The principal part consists\r\nmerely of the axial filament, and a thin outer covering, while the end\r\npiece is quite thin and is made up solely of the uncovered axial\r\nfilament. The finer structures are seen only when special staining\r\nreactions are used, and then only when the sperms are obtained directly\r\nfrom the testicle. The function of the sperms is of course primarily\r\nthat of fertilization. Numerous observers have, however, thought that\r\nthey might have some other definite, though unknown, use.\r\n\r\nAn editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association (33)\r\nraises several important questions regarding this obscure phenomenon.\r\nThe fact that an enormous number of spermatozoa are produced, and only\r\none, or at most, a few perform the function of fertilization, raises the\r\nquestion as to what becomes of the remainder. It is stated: “Zoologists\r\nhave found that in some of the invertebrates the spermatozoa invade the\r\nentire body of the female, and in some species they reach the ovum by\r\npenetrating the cuticle from outside and migrating to their goal.\r\nStudies on rodents show that the sperms invade the epithelium of the\r\ngenerative mucosa and underlying connective tissue. These tissues seemed\r\nto be stimulated to growth, suggesting that this may influence the\r\nuterine mucosa in its preparation for receiving and embedding the egg,\r\nand in forming the decidua.” It has been shown that the sperms contain a\r\nspecific protein capable of producing antibodies in the blood plasma, by\r\nciting the fact that rabbits develop a distinct Aberhalden reaction for\r\ntesticular proteins shortly after cohabitation. One very important\r\nobservation showed that by immunizing female rabbits with sperms they\r\nwere rendered sterile for some time, although after a few months they\r\nagain became capable of impregnation. The question raised is: “... if\r\nthe spermatozoa invade the female tissues and cause the formation of\r\nspecific antibodies which are capable of preventing fertilization, may\r\nnot such a process participate in the problem of sterility?” This very\r\nproblem seems to be a factor in explaining why some couples who are not\r\nfertile to each other subsequently are both fertile when they cohabit\r\nwith other individuals.\r\n\r\n_Motility_: After clinical observation of the motility of the\r\nspermatozoa of the bull, I find that it differs little or none from the\r\ntypes as observed by Reynolds (34) in his work on human spermatozoa. His\r\nobservations are so accurate and well described that they will be given\r\nin his words. “All normal motions appear to be consecutive phases.\r\nInitial motion, i. e., motion as seen in fresh semen under favorable\r\nconditions, consists of a lashing of the after part of the tail from\r\nside to side which is so rapid as to constitute vibration. It produces\r\nrapid forward motion in a practically straight line, the head, middle\r\npiece, and forward portion of the tail maintaining their position in the\r\nline of motion with practically no swaying from side to side. The action\r\nof the flagellum is so rapid that it is quite impossible to follow its\r\nindividual movements. Spermatozoa swimming in this manner head against\r\nthe current and usually cross the field of observation in about five\r\nseconds in the absence of currents or obstacles. This type of motion\r\nwill be described throughout the paper as ‘progressive vibratile’\r\nmotion. Progressive vibratile motion is normally succeeded after a\r\nvariable length of time by what I regard as the second phase of normal\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n“The second normal motion differs from the first not only in its\r\ncharacter but in markedly reduced speed. The tail movement alters to a\r\nlong stroke from side to side and almost the whole length of the tail\r\npartakes in the stroke. This is, moreover, accompanied by swaying of the\r\nhead and middle piece through an arc which is always considerable and\r\nmay even equal ninety degrees. The general outline of the spermatozoa,\r\nfrom being practically straight with almost non-detectable sharp, quick,\r\nsmall arc vibration of the after-tail, has become an S in outline, with\r\nlarge, slow, plainly perceptible undulations traveling gradually\r\nbackward throughout the length of the spermatozoon. Speed has been lost\r\nand direction seems to be more specifically determined by the\r\nsurroundings. Individuals at this stage show a pronounced choice of\r\ndirection and go up to objects in the medium, from which they later make\r\noff as though the movement were determined by tactile reaction to some\r\nextent. This type of motion has, therefore, been named ‘undulatory\r\ntactile’ in contradistinction to ‘progressive vibratile.’\r\n\r\n“The third type of normal motion succeeds the second and consists in a\r\ntendency on the part of the spermatozoon to push itself against or into\r\nany small masses of cells, or sometimes other materials, which it may\r\nfind in the neighborhood, bunting itself into any small cove that can be\r\nfound, and maintaining a slight burrowing motion by a lashing tail\r\nmovement of the vibratile type not unlike the movements of the caudal\r\nfin of a fish. The movement of the flagellum in this third type is\r\nunlike the second type in that it is vibratile rather than lashing, but\r\nis slower than the vibratile motion of the first type and less limited\r\nto the afterpart of the tail. These spermatozoa are apparently not\r\ncaught in the debris or unable to move off. From time to time, they back\r\nout of such a cove and seek another mooring place.\r\n\r\n“This ‘stationary hunting’ motion is less universal than the other two.\r\nMany individual spermatozoa fail to attain it. It seems probable that\r\nonly the most vigorous individuals ever reach this stair”. It has not\r\nbeen encountered in unmixed semen or in any artificial mediums. It has\r\nbeen observed only when the spermatozoon is in the secretions of the\r\nfemale genital tract. It is most frequent when the spermatozoon is in\r\ncontact with a nest of epithelial cells....\r\n\r\n“The three types of normal motion are not only distinctive but are\r\nalways consecutive, i. e., the second follows the first after a period\r\nwhich is apparently determined both by initial vitality and by the\r\nfavorable or unfavorable character of the medium, while the third has\r\nbeen observed to occur only in individuals which have already developed\r\nthe second. They apparently constitute a normal cycle.\r\n\r\n“This cycle is open to the theoretical explanation that these types of\r\nmotion are directly adapted to the function of the spermatozoon; thus,\r\nthe progressive vibratile motion which is characteristic of the earliest\r\nperiod of its existence appears especially suitable for its prolonged\r\njourney through the cervix and uterus to the fundus and tube. This is\r\nsupported by the fact that during this motion it always heads directly\r\nagainst any existing current, and that during this stage of its journey\r\nit must under natural conditions be continuously exposed to the faint\r\noutward ciliary currents of the mucous membrane of these passages.\r\n\r\n“The undulatory tactile motion which succeeds the progressive vibratile\r\nwould then be well adapted to the later stage in which the spermatozoon\r\nhas reached the tube, where its success in conjugation is dependent on\r\nits finding the ovum rather than on further progress.\r\n\r\n“The stationary bunting type of motion is that which would be demanded\r\nby the passage of the spermatozoon through the egg membrane which has\r\nbeen so often observed in the lower animals. This very plausible\r\nexplanation is, however, necessarily theoretical and must always remain\r\nso, as the conditions which surround the specimen on the field of the\r\nmicroscope vary in so many respects from those in which it accomplishes\r\nconjugation in the course of nature; but the practical importance of the\r\nstudy of types of motion is not affected by their explanation.”\r\n\r\nThe duration of motility is a variable factor, dependent entirely upon\r\nthe environment in which the spermatozoa are placed. Within the body\r\nthey usually survive at least a week. One author describes a case in\r\nwhich he found living sperms in a woman who stated that coition had not\r\nbeen experienced for three and one-half weeks. It has been stated with\r\nregard to human sperms, that their motion should continue or be capable\r\nof being re-established for twelve hours. Cary (35) states, “first, that\r\nin their proper medium and at the body temperature the viability of the\r\nsperm cells may extend over a period of a few days; second, that their\r\nprolonged vitality is probably dependent upon the normal lime salts of\r\nthe prostatic fluid; third, that the sustaining power of the seminal\r\nfluid is increased by its union with the normal secretion of the female\r\ngenital tract.” After death of the male animal they retain their\r\nmotility in the genital tract for twenty-four to forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nWolf (36) worked on this problem in rabbits, and summarizes as follows:\r\n“The motility of rabbit spermatozoa can be preserved for at least nine\r\ndays by placing the juice of the epididymis in the Tyrode solution which\r\nhad been buffered and to which glucose had been added. The solution is\r\nadjusted to a pH of about 7.4. Oxygen is passed in and a suitable amount\r\nof sodium bicarbonate added. The preparation must be kept at a\r\ntemperature near the freezing point of water.” Under ordinary conditions\r\nmotility persists outside the body only a few hours after ejaculation,\r\nbut if the semen is kept quite cool till the time of examination on a\r\nwarm stage, motility should be capable of being restored in at least a\r\nfair percentage of the sperms for twenty-four to forty-eight hours. The\r\ncells are more sensitive to heat than to cold, and even to dilute acids\r\nmore than to alkalies.\r\n\r\nHenle (quoted by Ellenberger) states that a spermatozoon under favorable\r\nconditions travels at the rate of twenty-seven millimeters in seven and\r\none-half minutes, which makes three and five-tenths millimeters per\r\nminute. This is about sixty times the entire length of the spermatozoon,\r\nand twenty-one centimeters in an hour. Forward motion is also more\r\npronounced when the swim is against the current, such as is produced by\r\nthe cilia of the oviduct. It has been demonstrated that feebly motile\r\nsperms become very actively motile when placed on the mucosa of a fresh\r\nFallopian tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TECHNIQUE\r\n\r\nThe material used in the work came from abattoir animals, bull calves\r\nand adult bulls raised in the department herd, and sires upon which\r\nclinical observations had been made by various veterinarians in the\r\nfield. Semen samples, many of which were sent in, were collected as\r\noften as possible after the method described by Williams (16). The\r\ngenital organs were removed with as little chance of contamination as\r\npossible, and taken or sent to the laboratory where the examinations\r\nwere made soon after arrival.\r\n\r\nAll cultures were made by searing the surface carefully, tearing out a\r\nsmall portion of the tissue with sterile forceps, and placing it upon\r\nthe media. In most cases, however, where fluids were present, tubes were\r\ninoculated with the material which had been drawn off with a sterile\r\npipette. As stated by Carpenter (9), in his work on the female genital\r\ntract, the organisms usually live in the depths of the tissue. The media\r\nused principally were glucose glycerin agar (glucose 1 per cent,\r\nglycerin 3 per cent); plain agar, both with a pH value of 7.4, and\r\nLoeffler’s blood serum. Small amounts of sterile blood serum or\r\ndefibrinated blood were added to most of the agar slants to insure\r\nbetter growths of streptococci when present. All tubes, to which the\r\nserum had been added, were incubated for forty-eight hours before\r\ninoculation to insure absolute sterility.\r\n\r\nAfter inoculation, the agar tubes were sealed with sealing wax to give a\r\npartial oxygen tension which was quite necessary in isolating the\r\nstreptococci. The growth of other organisms was by no means hindered by\r\nthe procedure, for one tube from each organ was often left unsealed.\r\nIncubation was at 37° C, and the routine method of examining the tubes\r\nwas identical with the method of Carpenter (9).\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, a sample of blood was obtained from the animal either\r\nbefore, or at the time of slaughter, for agglutination with _Bact.\r\nabortum_ antigen. Extracts from the seminal vesicles, testes, and\r\nepididymes were injected into the guinea pigs and examined at the end of\r\nfour to six weeks for the presence of _Bact. abortum_.\r\n\r\nSections of all organs were fixed as soon as possible in either Zenker’s\r\nor Helly’s fluid. Hematoxylin and eosin were used as routine tissue\r\nstains. Eosin and methylene blue, and Mallory’s connective tissue stain\r\nwere, however, frequently utilized for special staining reactions.\r\n\r\nThe motility of the spermatozoa is best observed about half an hour\r\nafter ejaculation, when the thick tenacious clot has started to liquefy.\r\nA drop of the fluid is placed upon a warmed slide, preferably one with a\r\nslight depression in it, and observation made with high or low powered\r\nobjectives. The semen may be examined whole, or diluted with\r\nphysiological saline solution. In the latter case, the sperms have a\r\ngreater opportunity for freedom of motion in the absence of the thick\r\nviscid coagulate. A small vial of saline solution may be carried in\r\none’s pocket where it will be kept warm, and a drop of this placed upon\r\nthe glass slide. If the clot of semen is merely touched to this drop on\r\nthe slide, plenty of spermatozoa will be deposited for an examination.\r\nThis method is very satisfactory for the observation of motility, but\r\nneedless to say, the undiluted semen must be used for the determination\r\nof the number of sperms present. If necessary, the specimen may be\r\ncovered with a cover glass and the oil immersion objective used. While a\r\nwarmed slide is quite sufficient to enable one to detect the presence of\r\nmotility, the field soon cools and the sperms gradually become less\r\nmotile. If possible, it is best to use a small electrically heated stage\r\nwarmer, which keeps the field at a constant body temperature, so that\r\nthe duration of the motion may be observed for hours if warmed\r\nphysiological saline solution is added as the fluid evaporates.\r\n\r\nStained preparations are best made with _thin_ smears on the glass\r\nslides. This is conveniently done by placing a drop of the semen on a\r\nslide and smearing it over the surface with the edge of another slide. A\r\nfairly thin and even field is thus obtained. A still better method is to\r\nfirst dilute the semen with physiological saline solution, so as to\r\nobtain fewer sperms in the field. After drying the preparation in air,\r\nfixation may be produced by drawing the slide through a gas flame\r\nseveral times, by immersion in equal parts of alcohol and ether, or even\r\nby the use of tissue fixers such as Helly’s or Zenker’s fluids. For\r\nordinary staining, heat fixation is the quickest, and at the same time\r\nis quite satisfactory. After the slide is cooled, or washed, to remove\r\nthe fixing solutions, it should be placed for a few minutes in a\r\n_freshly_ prepared solution (1 per cent) of chlorazene, as recommended\r\nby Williams, to remove the mucus and proteid material which otherwise\r\nblur the field. Other authors (38) have recommended diluting the semen\r\nwith about twenty volumes of a 0.12 per cent sodium carbonate solution\r\nin 0.8 per cent sodium chloride. From this liquid the cells should be\r\ncentrifuged for several minutes, removed with a pipette, and smeared on\r\nthe slide. Following this, the slide should be thoroughly washed,\r\npreferably for ten minutes in running water, after which it is ready for\r\nstaining. Numerous methods have been used for this procedure, but the\r\nsperms are more or less erratic in their reactions to the dyes, and one\r\nmust be very careful to use the same method in all samples, in order to\r\nobtain uniform results. For quick staining, to bring out gross\r\nabnormalities of structure, and number of sperms present, one may use\r\nGram’s stain, or a light stain with any of the aniline dyes, such as\r\nfuchsin. To bring out the finer structure, particularly of the head,\r\nmore careful technic must be employed.\r\n\r\nCarnett and others (38) recommend the following: “The method of staining\r\nby iron-hematoxylin, particularly when supplemented by a cytoplasm\r\nstain, has proved, on the whole, the most satisfactory, and possesses\r\nthe additional advantage of being absolutely permanent, a quality that\r\nfew anilines can boast. The method consisted of treating the fixed\r\nobject—and here the fixing agent was heat—with a two per cent solution\r\nof iron-alum for from two to four hours. The excess of iron-alum was\r\nthen _completely_ removed by pure water, and the object treated with a\r\nsolution of hematoxylin (one per cent aqueous) for twelve hours or\r\nlonger. The cells by this time were perfectly black. However, a 1 per\r\ncent solution of iron-alum removed the stain from the cytoplasm, leaving\r\nthe chromatin of the head, the centrosome, and the axial filament a\r\nbrilliant blue-black. Care must be taken that the preparation is not\r\nover-decolorized. After decolorization a saturated aqueous solution of\r\neosin was added for from one to three minutes. This stained the\r\nprotoplasmic envelope pink, and, unless the envelope is overstained, the\r\nview of the inner structures is not impaired in the least.”\r\n\r\nWilliams (17) recommends using two staining solutions, one of alcoholic\r\neosin and fuchsin, the other a diluted methylene blue. The results\r\nobtained are, however, more or less erratic, due to the unstable\r\ncharacter of the former stain, and the ease with which one may over or\r\nunder stain. Many beautiful specimens may, nevertheless, be obtained by\r\nthis method. I have frequently used a fairly quick method, though one\r\nnot satisfactory in all cases, which consists of staining for five or\r\nsix minutes in a saturated aqueous solution of fuchsin, washing in\r\nwater, and counterstaining for a few seconds in a strong solution of\r\nmethylene blue. A quite satisfactory method is to stain from two to five\r\nminutes in a saturated aqueous solution of methyl green, with the\r\napplication of gentle heat. The heat may be applied by warming the slide\r\nover a gas flame as it steams, or by placing the jar containing the\r\nstain in a hot water bath. The slide is then washed thoroughly and\r\ncounterstained for five minutes in a strong aqueous solution of eosin.\r\nThis is a fairly reliable method, and many excellent preparations may be\r\nobtained by its use. The nucleus is stained green, the anterior part of\r\nthe head and all of the tail pink. So far, I have found this a very\r\nreliable stain for routine work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PATHOLOGY\r\n\r\nIn the genital tracts that I have studied, a complete pathological and\r\nbacteriological examination was made wherever possible, but in many of\r\nthe abattoir animals, and certain others, gross and microscopical\r\nexaminations only could be made. The genital organs of one hundred and\r\nninety-six males have been examined, and the gross or microscopical\r\nchanges, or both, determined. The abattoir animals were from a large\r\nslaughter house, and a small local plant.\r\n\r\nOf the tracts, the pathology of which was studied, two were from aborted\r\nfetuses; seven from apparently normal young calves; four from mature\r\nfertile bulls; and sixteen from mature infertile or sterile sires. The\r\nremainder (167) of those examined were from abattoir animals. Besides\r\nthese, three specimens of seminal vesicles, and seven of testes were\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\nThe tracts of the aborted fetuses and veal calves were apparently\r\nnormal, both on gross and microscopic examination of the vesicles and\r\ntestes. On gross examination, the tracts of the mature fertile bulls\r\nwere normal, except for the presence of many fine connective tissue\r\ntufts and strands upon the serous covering of the tails of the\r\nepididymes, and adjacent portion of the parietal layer of the tunica\r\nvaginalis. Microscopic sections of all parts were apparently normal. The\r\nmore important pathological changes in the tracts of the sixteen sterile\r\nor infertile bulls are given in the appended chart. The tracts are\r\nnumbered the same as in Group VI of the report of the bacteriological\r\nfindings; that is, any particular number in either table refers to the\r\nsame animal. References are made throughout the text to some cases which\r\nappear in this group of animals. Prostate and Cowper’s glands are not\r\nincluded in the chart as they were not examined in some, and were\r\nnegative in the others. Fibrous tufts and strands were present on the\r\ncovering of the epididymes in each animal.\r\n\r\nThe study of sections from the abattoir animals, as well as those from\r\nthe sterile or infertile bulls, forms the basis for the following\r\nobservations upon the pathology of the male genital tract. The tracts\r\nsecured from the abattoir were studied for the most part on the basis of\r\nthe organ rather than on that of the animal. For example, all sections\r\nof testes were placed in the same bottle of fixer, and the same plan\r\nfollowed for the other organs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTES: The testes seldom presented gross alterations of structure\r\nexcept for abscess formation, which, according to Williams, occurs more\r\nfrequently in the bull than in any of the other domesticated animals. He\r\nalso states that arrest in development by which the organs remain soft,\r\nflaccid, and somewhat smaller than normal is not uncommon. One very\r\ninteresting specimen, which typifies abscess formation, came from a bull\r\nwith a history revealing that one testis had become much enlarged, hot,\r\nand painful. These symptoms developed very rapidly. Anorexia was well\r\nmarked. Local applications were used for several weeks, but at the end\r\nof two months the condition was so little improved that unilateral\r\ncastration was performed. The general condition of the animal soon\r\nimproved, but after a year of service he was so uncertain compared to\r\nwhat he had been, that he was sent to the butcher. It was impossible to\r\nobtain the other testicle for study, though it undoubtedly was abnormal.\r\nThe testicle removed was considerably enlarged, measuring twenty by ten\r\nand one-half centimeters. The tunica albuginea presented a thickness of\r\nsix millimeters, and was made up of firm sclerotic tissue. The\r\nepididymis was not recognizable in the mass. Testicular tissue was\r\nalmost entirely gone. The only remains, of what appeared to have been\r\nparenchyma, was an elongated irregular area at one side of the organ.\r\nThis tissue consisted of a whitish opalescent material, speckled with\r\nvarying sized abscesses. This organ is pictured in Fig. 3. The remainder\r\nof the organ consisted of a thick yellowish caseous mass. _Streptococcus\r\nviridans_ was recovered from the outer portion of the organ, and guinea\r\npig inoculations failed to demonstrate _Bact. abortum_.\r\n\r\nMicroscopically, changes are quite common and varied in character. In\r\nthe seminiferous tubules, the changes range from a slight desquamation\r\nof the germinal epithelium to atrophy and complete degeneration of the\r\nentire tubule, as was the case in the left testis of Bull 1. In the mild\r\ncases, spermatogenesis occurs apparently in a normal manner up to the\r\nspermatid stage, at which point many of the cells degenerate and slough\r\noff. These appear in the seminal fluid, associated with the few sperms\r\nthat reach maturity. This sloughing and degeneration may be localized in\r\na few of the tubules, or it may be widespread over the entire organ.\r\nLikewise, the changes may involve not only the more mature cells, but\r\nthey may be so severe as to cause almost total degeneration and\r\ndesquamation of the seminal epithelium, as in Fig. 15. These defects in\r\nspermatogenesis are of course evidenced in the semen by the presence of\r\nimmature, or abnormal types of sperms. With cessation of spermatogenesis\r\nor degeneration of the epithelium of the entire gland, no sperms are\r\nformed. Not infrequently one finds numerous tubules, or even the entire\r\ntestis in which the germinal epithelium is intact, but there is little\r\nor no evidence of mitosis, as in some tubules of Bull 6. The cells are\r\nseveral layers deep as in the normal condition, but they are not\r\ndividing. This condition is shown in Fig. 13.\r\n\r\nIn the more chronic forms, the tubules become atrophied, and frequently\r\ndisappear entirely. The membrana propria may become thickened, due to\r\nexcessive connective tissue formation, or infiltration with serum or\r\nexudate. On the other hand, a distinct atrophy may occur. The stroma of\r\nthe organ not infrequently is thickened by inflammatory exudates, or by\r\na noticeable increase in the connective tissue. In some testes, the\r\nconnective tissue is so much increased that the tubules rapidly become\r\natrophied, and disappear. In abscess formation, due to acute\r\ninflammations, the entire organ becomes enlarged, markedly hyperaemic,\r\nand infiltrated with leucocytes. Necrotic areas appear here and there in\r\nthe parenchyma. The rete often shows a marked degeneration of the lining\r\nepithelium, and atrophy caused by increase of the interstitial\r\nconnective tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPIDIDYMIS: This organ not infrequently presents gross abnormalities,\r\nand very often is pathological on microscopic examination. Acute,\r\ninflammation, with induration or abscess formation, is very common in\r\nthe tail, but less so in the head and body. Possibly this is caused by\r\nthe fact that the tail is the most pendant portion of the organ. In\r\nthese cases, the tail is enlarged, soft, and quite hot and painful on\r\nphysical examination. Enlargement, due to a connective tissue\r\ninduration, occurs occasionally in all three parts, and the inflammation\r\nmay produce adhesions to the adjacent serous membranes. Inflammation of\r\nboth the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis is very\r\ncommon. In those cases, the membrane usually is quite hyperaemic, and on\r\nthe surface it presents many small reddened tufts of newly-formed\r\nconnective tissue. In adult bulls it is exceptional not to find at least\r\nslight evidence of some previous inflammation. In all of the numerous\r\nbulls examined, both apparently normal and sterile, I have found but one\r\nin which some evidence of inflammation (either present or past) could\r\nnot be found. Along with the fibrous tufts, are numerous fine strands of\r\nconnective tissues passing from the covering of the tail of the\r\nepididymis to the adjacent portion of the parietal layer of the tunica.\r\nThe strands often extend even to the upper part of the head.\r\n\r\nMicroscopically, inflammation of the part is shown by hyperaemia, loss\r\nof cilia of the lining cells, and exudation. In the more severe forms,\r\nthe lining cells which furnish considerable secretion for the\r\nnourishment and stimulation of the sperms, become degenerated, and are\r\nexfoliated into the lumen, as in Fig. 21. This condition is very common\r\nin sterile bulls, and those of lowered fertility. In the chronic types,\r\nthe interstitial connective tissue is increased in amount, leading to\r\ndegeneration and atrophy of part or all of the tubules, as in the case\r\nof Bull 2. Infiltration with leucocytes, and necrosis, are the\r\npredominating lesions in the pyogenic types of inflammation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUCTUS DEFERENS: This tube seems to be peculiarly free from severe\r\ninflammatory processes, and when these appear they are limited to the\r\nmucosa. The cells of the lining membrane not infrequently show a mild\r\ntype of degeneration and exfoliation, or in the more chronic forms, the\r\nentire membrane degenerates and disappears. In man, the duct\r\noccasionally becomes occluded, but so far I have failed to find this\r\ncondition in the bull. Undoubtedly, when the occlusion does occur, it is\r\nnear the origin of the duct at the tail of the epididymis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMINAL VESICLES: The seminal vesicles and epididymis, especially the\r\ntail, seem to be the parts most subject to extensive pathological\r\nchanges, and bacterial invasion. In most instances, diseased vesicles\r\npresent gross manifestations recognizable on clinical examination, while\r\non the other hand microscopic changes may be present in the absence of\r\ngross lesions. As diagnosed on physical examination, or even on post\r\nmortem examination of the tract, the various forms may be classified\r\ninto:\r\n\r\n1. _Acute Catarrhal Type_: In this form, the vesicles are usually\r\nenlarged, soft, and more or less reddened by hyperaemia. On physical\r\nexamination of the animal, distinct flinching is produced when pressure\r\nis applied to the organ. Enlargement may even be absent in the early\r\nstages, and the diagnosis may be made from the extreme sensitiveness\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n2. _Suppurative or Cystic Types_: In both of these types, the vesicles\r\nare usually enlarged, either uniformly, or, as is usually the case, in\r\nlocalized areas. The suppurative form may extend over the entire gland,\r\nforming one large encapsulated abscess, or on the other hand, it may\r\ntake the form of variable sized abscesses with thick sclerotic, or thin\r\nfluctuating walls. Occasionally the abscesses rupture and discharge\r\ntheir contents into the rectum. Dr. Williams presented one case of this\r\ntype. One vesicle was apparently normal, whereas the other was about\r\nfive times larger than normal, and consisted of a dense outer capsule\r\nwhich was adherent to all surrounding parts. On dissection, it was found\r\nthat the organ consisted of abscesses of various sizes, the larger one\r\nof which had ruptured some time previously into the rectum, leaving the\r\ndistinct remains of an opening into that part. The cystic form may occur\r\neither with or without suppuration. One case came to my attention in\r\nwhich both vesicles were made up of abscesses of varying sizes as well\r\nas of a smaller number of cysts. Evidently the cysts were of the\r\nretention type, and were secondary to the pyogenic infection.\r\n\r\n3. _Chronic or Sclerotic Type_: This form is characterized by a distinct\r\nfirmness with or without marked enlargement. The condition may be\r\naccompanied by disease of the parenchymatous tissue or it may take the\r\nform of a chronic productive inflammation of the interstitial tissue.\r\nThis inflammation may be simply a superficial thickening, or it may\r\nextend in between the lobules.\r\n\r\n4. The _Peri-vesicular or “pan-inflammatory” Type_ usually is the result\r\nof severe inflammation of the vesicles, with probable rupture of some of\r\nthe smaller cysts or abscesses upon the surface. The vesicles are, as a\r\nrule, considerably enlarged and buried in a dense mass of adhesions\r\nwhich involve neighboring structures. The vesicles cannot be palpated on\r\nphysical examination, and it is only on careful post mortem dissection\r\nthat they may be studied. This type, however, is quite rare,—two cases\r\nonly having come to my attention. In both, the vesicles themselves were\r\nmarkedly affected.\r\n\r\nMicroscopically, changes in the vesicles are quite frequently\r\nencountered, even in the absence of gross manifestations. In the acute\r\ncatarrhal forms, the mucosa and submucosa are hyperaemic. The lining\r\ncells show various forms of degeneration, and there are, as a rule,\r\ninflammatory exudates in the lumen. As the inflammation progresses, the\r\nlining cells degenerate further, and become cast off into the lumen of\r\nthe glandular cavities, as in Plate VI. The normal clear mucous\r\nsecretion becomes mixed with fibrin, leucocytes, and cellular debris.\r\nThese changes may involve merely parts of the organ, or they may be\r\nquite extensive. With large sections, one may find the inflammation in\r\nall stages, from the mildest catarrhal type, to complete degeneration\r\nand exfoliation of the secretion-forming mucosal cells, and filling of\r\nthe cavities with degenerated cells, leucocytes, and debris. Frequently\r\nthe interstitial tissue is in no way affected, but at times it is\r\nthickened by oedematous exudates, leucocytes, and fibrin. The chronic\r\ninterstitial form is characterized by a considerable increase of\r\nconnective tissue,—producing marked atrophy, or even complete\r\nobliteration of the glandular cavities. Microscopically the suppurative\r\nform may be diffuse over the entire gland, or as stated previously, may\r\nbe in the form of localized abscesses, with or without a thick\r\nconnective tissue wall. The parenchyma in these cases is usually\r\nextensively degenerated and atrophied in those parts that have not\r\nundergone suppuration and necrosis. The cysts appear to be of the\r\nordinary retention type, and may or may not be accompanied by extensive\r\nchanges in the lining epithelium.\r\n\r\nBoth the abscess formation and cystic conditions are undoubtedly\r\ninitiated by an obstructive inflammation of all or part of the excretory\r\nduct. This is, however, a protective mechanism, for where the duct is\r\nclosed the bacteria and exudates are unable to reach the urethra and\r\ncontaminate the semen.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSTATE AND COWPER’S GLANDS: These glands were more or less neglected\r\nin the early part of the work, but later were subjected to the same\r\nexamination as other parts. Of the thirty-six of each type of gland\r\nexamined, I failed to find one with any gross changes, but two prostates\r\nwere found that presented a mild catarrhal inflammation of the mucosa.\r\nIt is probable that Cowper’s glands, as well, occasionally undergo\r\ninflammatory changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEN: The semen, made up as it is of mixed products of the testes and\r\naccessory sexual glands, is very often abnormal, as would be expected in\r\nview of the frequency with which changes occur in the glands\r\ncontributing to its formation. The normal semen is remarkably adapted to\r\nits function of nourishment and stimulation of the spermatozoa, and\r\ntheir conveyance to the internal female genital organs. The spermatozoa\r\nare extremely sensitive to changes in their environment, with the result\r\nthat any alteration of the physical or biochemical content of the\r\nseminal fluid may cause death of the sperms. With this in view, we must\r\nremember that disease of any of the contributing organs is a potential\r\ndanger, and threatens the potency of the animal. Each or all of the\r\nglands may add bacteria, acid secretions, or inflammatory exudates. On\r\nthe other hand, they may not function at all. In each case, however, the\r\nsemen is altered.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it is impossible with present methods to obtain the fluid\r\nabsolutely free from vaginal mucus, but with care it may be secured\r\nreasonably free from contamination by douching the prepuce of the bull\r\nand vagina of the cow before service. This method was used as often as\r\npossible in collecting the samples. The usual amount of semen obtained\r\nwas from six to ten cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\nWith a hypersecretion of one or all of the glands, the semen becomes\r\nquite thin and watery, with a deficiency of solid matter, together with\r\nchanges in reaction. On the other hand, hypofunction results in a\r\nsecretion too viscid, which is equally unsuited to the requirements of\r\nthe spermatozoa. The thin watery semen clots imperfectly or not at all,\r\nand clotting is essential in protecting the spermatozoa from the acid\r\nsecretions of the vagina. Likewise, a medium too viscid is a distinct\r\nhindrance to motility. Changes in reaction are very frequently\r\nencountered. The sperms are very sensitive to dilute acids, so that with\r\neven a slight acidity motility may diminish or entirely cease. Purulent\r\ninflammatory exudates are occasionally mixed with the semen, and\r\nalthough the pus cells themselves have not been found to be destructive\r\nto the sperms, certain degeneration products in the exudate are very\r\ntoxic, and inhibit or destroy the motility. So far, I have failed to\r\nfind red corpuscles present. One very interesting sample of semen was\r\nquite thick, of a yellowish green color, and of a distinctly acid\r\nreaction. The secretion from the vesicles was later found to be of this\r\nsame character, and was due to a _Ps. pyocyaneus_ infection. The\r\nvesicles were highly inflamed and degenerated. The spermatozoa were in\r\nthis case markedly decreased in number, and devoid of motility.\r\n\r\nThe early precipitation of the “Boettcherchen” crystals seems to be\r\nintimately connected with sterile semen, or spermatozoa of lowered\r\nvitality. Likewise, a decrease in solid matter is often seen in a\r\ndeficient secretion. In normal semen, the clot disappears after standing\r\na time, and a thick sediment settles out. This sediment is decreased in\r\namount as a rule in abnormal semen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPERMATOZOA: Spermatozoa, the essential germinal elements, are very\r\nfrequently abnormal, changes in which may be manifested in many ways. We\r\nmay divide the deviations into changes in structure, and changes in the\r\nmotility which is so indicative of the intrinsic vitality of the sperm.\r\nReynolds (34) describes two forms of abnormal motion. The first is\r\n“rotary swimming,” in which the sperms move forward progressively, and\r\nsometimes with fair rapidity, but in a spiral screwlike manner. He\r\nstates that this type of swimming is very awkward, easy to recognize,\r\nand is usually of quite long duration. The other form termed “pendulum\r\nswimming,” he states, is less common than the rotary swimming and is\r\nusually confined to relatively fewer sperms in a given field. “In this\r\nthe middle piece and upper tail seem to lose their flexibility and\r\nbalance to a considerable degree, and the lower tail motion swings the\r\nforward part of the spermatozoon to and fro with a pendulum movement.\r\nThis type of swimming yields very poor progress.”\r\n\r\nOne factor we must bear in mind in the study of the semen obtained from\r\nthe vagina, is that the spermatozoa may be highly motile before\r\nejaculation, but the admixture of hostile vaginal mucus may inhibit or\r\ndestroy the motility. On the other hand, the conditions may be reversed.\r\nCary (35), in one instance, found that the spermatozoa in a sample of\r\nsemen collected from a condom, appeared to be of very low vitality,\r\nwhile when they were mixed with the vaginal secretions, an exaggerated\r\nactivity was manifested. May we not have to contend with this factor in\r\nsome herds in which there is a very distinct acid and toxic vaginal\r\nsecretion from the products of cervicitis and vaginitis?\r\n\r\nIn a study of motility, we must consider not only the abnormal types\r\nwhich may be encountered but the percentage of motile cells, and the\r\nduration of the movement. In _necrospermia_ all the ejaculated cells are\r\nmotionless or dead. In other specimens, varying percentages of the cells\r\nare without motion, and the others may be possessed of full and lasting\r\nmotility. On the other hand, the motility in some cases is very active\r\nat first, but quickly subsides even under the best of conditions. The\r\nappearance in freshly ejaculated semen of numerous sperms that have a\r\ntendency to take on the “undulatory tactile” type of motion when they\r\nshould be in a highly active state, is very indicative of lowered\r\nvitality. Many specimens present this very picture, whereas the very\r\nactive progressive movement should, under proper conditions, survive for\r\na considerable time before it gives way to the second, and slower type.\r\nThe cells frequently early bunt into epithelial cells or clumps of\r\nimmotile sperms, then back out and move around sluggishly, only to\r\nrepeat the same performance till they stop moving entirely. I have seen\r\none specimen in which the sperms all tended to clump. Whether this was\r\nthe result of some agglutinative substance in the vaginal secretion is\r\nproblematical. I have seen several specimens of semen in which\r\npractically all the sperms were motile when first examined, but the\r\nmotion did not survive for any great length of time. Even a small\r\npercentage of motionless sperms or of those showing lowered vitality is\r\na considerable factor in potency. Although millions of the germinal\r\nelements are ejaculated into the vagina, large numbers of them are\r\ndestroyed or become motionless there, and a small number is left behind\r\nin the cervix and uterus; so that even though but a single sperm is\r\nrequired for fertilization, the chances of impregnation are diminished\r\nin proportion to the number of dead or defective sperms.\r\n\r\n_Aspermia_: Absence of spermatozoa in the semen is rarely encountered,\r\nand is probably due either to total cessation of spermatogenesis, or to\r\nan obstruction at some point in the system of excretory ducts. I have\r\nseen but one case of this character. The semen of this bull was greatly\r\nincreased in amount, and of a thin watery consistency. Due to lack of\r\ncooperation on the part of the owners, the tract could not be obtained\r\nfor study. _Oligospermia_, or a diminution of the number of spermatozoa,\r\nis quite common, and is undoubtedly associated with defective\r\nspermatogenesis, either as a result of poor mitosis of the seminal\r\nepithelium, or degeneration of the elements before maturity. This\r\ncondition may vary from the finding of only occasional dead sperms in\r\nthe field, to but a slight decrease in the usual number of normal sperms\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nAbnormalities in morphology may be classified into immature types, and\r\ndeformities or imperfect development of the head and tail. Defective\r\nspermatogenesis occurs so frequently that it is not surprising to find\r\nspermatozoa in various stages of development cast into the excretory\r\nducts. The various stages passed through in the development, from\r\nspermatogonia to adult sperm, are numerous, and it therefore is to be\r\nexpected that we should see in abnormal semen many different immature\r\nforms. No classification of the various types can be made, but a clearer\r\nunderstanding of them can best be obtained by a review of the process of\r\nspermatogenesis.\r\n\r\nSpermatocytes and spermatids are seen in the more severe types of\r\ndefective spermatogenesis, and are relatively uncommon, while the more\r\nmature forms that result from the transformations of spermatid to adult\r\ncell are very often seen. Some of these intermediate types are large\r\noval cells without distinct nuclei and as a rule with poorly developed\r\ntails. Cells with no tails or distinct nuclei, those with protoplasmic\r\nappendages to the head or tail, and various other types, are\r\noccasionally encountered. Most of these are motionless and incapable of\r\nproducing impregnation. Others are active, but survive a comparatively\r\nshort time. According to Cary, the production of the immature cells is\r\nan effort on the part of the testes to supply an abnormal demand, and\r\ntheir presence indicates that the fertility of the semen is impaired.\r\n\r\nThe deformities, which may be divided into cephalic and caudal groups,\r\nare also the product of defective spermatogenesis, or they represent a\r\ndegenerative process induced possibly by abnormalities of the fluid\r\nenvironment. It is rather difficult, however, to distinguish between\r\ndeformities and immature types. The two most common cephalic deformities\r\nare what might be called macro and microcephalic forms. In the former,\r\nthe head is enlarged to a greater or less extent, it is usually\r\ndefective in staining qualities, and its outline is indistinct, due to\r\ndegeneration of the covering membrane. This type is seen in Fig. 32.\r\nAlso the shape of the head is usually abnormal, being either quite\r\nrounded, long and narrow, or short and very broad. Cells with\r\nprotoplasmic appendages, though they are more properly an immature type,\r\noccasionally give the head a greater volume. Microcephalic sperms vary\r\nfrom those slightly smaller than normal to those in which the head is\r\nrepresented by a slight knob. In some cells, the head is small and\r\nround, in others, short and stubby, while another type is normal in\r\noutline but diminutive in size. These forms likewise are, as a rule,\r\ndeficient in staining qualities, and are undoubtedly degeneration forms,\r\noccurring either as the result of faulty development, or degeneration\r\nsubsequent to their formation. Cary believes they are degeneration types\r\nbecause in the majority of cells the tail is apparently fully formed,\r\nand in the normal process of evolution the tail is the last part of the\r\ncell to be exhibited. Double headed forms are quite rare, but they\r\nnevertheless appear at times. Their significance is difficult to\r\nexplain. Another very frequent deformity of the head is a marked\r\nconstriction at the posterior part so that it is the shape of a pear or\r\ntop as in Fig. 27. In some, the head is otherwise normal in size, while\r\nin others it is much elongated, as in Fig. 28, or considerably\r\natrophied. A constriction at the middle of the head, as in Fig. 29, is\r\nnot uncommon. Both defects are undoubtedly the result of nuclear\r\ndeficiency, as the nuclear part of the head in these cases is much\r\ndiminished in size, and stains very deeply or not at all. I have seen\r\nspermatozoa, the heads of which were like an inverted cone, with a\r\nbulging rounded base. Other heads are even somewhat contorted and bent\r\non themselves, as shown to some extent in Fig. 26.\r\n\r\nUnder caudal deformities, the most frequent form encountered is a\r\nthickening of the connecting piece. This may occur as a uniform\r\nthickening, or as a bulging appendage. Rudimentary development of the\r\ntail, the presence of two poorly formed tails, and defective development\r\nof the connecting piece occur rather infrequently.\r\n\r\nAll these immature and defective types are, as a rule, motionless, and\r\nof course incapable of producing fertilization. Their presence indicates\r\nlowered fertility of the semen. Besides these deformities, there are\r\nsperms showing a curvature of the tail at an acute angle just posterior\r\nto the neck,—the so-called “wry neck.” Their significance is difficult\r\nto explain, but they occur frequently in semen fixed and stained by the\r\nsame routine methods used on samples in which they are absent. They\r\nprobably are not the result of the methods used in fixing and staining.\r\nSome think they are slightly immature types, or that the condition is\r\nproduced by abnormal contractions of the tail. The majority of sperms,\r\nhowever, especially those from highly fertile bulls, do not show this\r\ntype at all.\r\n\r\nThe most common changes in the spermatozoa, are those in which there is\r\na separation of the head from the tail, and degeneration of the head as\r\nevidenced by reaction to stains. The separation of the head from the\r\ntail always occurs at the neck, and often is associated with\r\ndegeneration or abnormalities of the head. The separation, in the\r\nmajority of cases, indicates some lowering of vitality in the elements,\r\nalthough in many instances traumatism produced in making smears or\r\ncollecting the samples is responsible. Various forms of abnormal\r\nstaining of the head are very common. The cell membrane, which is\r\nnormally distinct and sharp, becomes blurred in outline. Normally, the\r\nhead takes a good differential stain, the anterior part staining\r\nlightly, and the posterior part somewhat deeper. The nucleus is distinct\r\nin outline and well defined. The lighter “inner body” stands out in well\r\nstained specimens. As the result of degeneration, the whole head may\r\ntake the stain uniformly, either slightly or much deeper than normal,\r\naccording to the degree of degeneration. The whole problem of staining,\r\nhowever, depends very much upon the methods used, and the care with\r\nwhich they are applied. When a good method is obtained, it should be\r\nadhered to, and used uniformly on all specimens. As a rule, however, a\r\ncertain amount of practice will enable one to differentiate between the\r\nsharply outlined, clearly staining normal forms, and those that show\r\nabnormal reactions to the stains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BACTERIOLOGY\r\n\r\nA complete bacteriological study was made of the genital tracts of\r\nfourteen normal young veal calves (six to twelve weeks old), four mature\r\nfertile bulls, and sixteen mature bulls, either sterile or impotent to\r\nsome degree. Together with these, the tracts of eleven aborted fetuses,\r\nseven calves dying from calf infections (scours or pneumonia), and\r\nsixteen bulls slaughtered at an abattoir were studied bacteriologically.\r\nOccasionally, studies were made of individual seminal vesicles or\r\ntestes, when these parts alone were brought or sent in. The history of\r\nthe abattoir animals was, of course, quite indefinite or entirely\r\nnegative. On the killing floor, many tracts could be studied for\r\npathological changes, but in the bacteriological work it was difficult\r\nto care for more than two tracts on each visit.\r\n\r\nThe results of the bacteriological examinations are given in the\r\nappended tables, in which the tracts are divided into six groups. The\r\nresults in Group I. consisting of normal veal calves, indicate that the\r\ngenital organs of young male calves are, under normal conditions, free\r\nfrom bacteria. Carpenter (9) obtained like results in examining the\r\ngenital tracts of heifer calves. The cultures made from the seminal\r\nvesicles and testes of all these veal calves were, with two exceptions,\r\nnegative. Both seminal vesicles of one tract and one of another yielded\r\ncultures of _Staphylococcus albus_.\r\n\r\nAdult bulls of known fertility were naturally difficult to obtain, only\r\nthe four animals in Group II being available for examination. Two of\r\nthese (Nos. 1 and 2) were from the experimental herd kept by the\r\ndepartment, and at all times had a good breeding history. The other two\r\nwere good breeders, but were slaughtered because of poor pedigrees. Bull\r\n1, raised in the department herd, had a severe attack of scours when a\r\nfew weeks old, while the calfhood history of the other is not known, he\r\nhaving been purchased after reaching sexual maturity. The cultures from\r\nthe genital organs of the former (Bull 1) were entirely negative, except\r\nthose from the left epididymis and scrotal sac, which yielded growths of\r\n_Streptococcus viridans_. All the organs of the tract from this animal\r\nwere normal, except for the fact that numerous strands of connective\r\ntissue extended from the serous covering of the tail of both epididymes\r\nto the adjacent part of the parietal layer of the tunica. The tract of\r\nthe other failed to show any organisms. The only evidence of any\r\nabnormality was the presence of the same connective tissue strands on\r\nthe tail of the epididymis, as in the first tract. The other two bulls\r\ngave negative cultures from all parts.\r\n\r\nOf the sixteen bulls in Group III, slaughtered at abattoirs, and in\r\nwhich no history was available, eight failed to show the presence of any\r\norganisms in their genitalia. Of the others, the vesicles yielded\r\ncultures of _Staphylococcus albus_ nine times, and _streptococci_ four\r\ntimes. _Staphylococcus albus_ was recovered once from the prostate, and\r\nonce from Cowper’s glands. The testes gave cultures of staphylococci in\r\ntwo cases, and _Bact. abortum_ in one. No observable anatomical changes\r\naccompanied the presence of the Bang bacillus in this case. The\r\nepididymes showed growths of staphylococci five times, and streptococci\r\non three occasions. _Streptococci_ were isolated from the scrotal sacs\r\nof eight testes.\r\n\r\nThe results in Group IV (aborted fetuses) show that bacteria are often\r\npresent in the seminal vesicles or testes of these animals. As a rule,\r\nhowever, the organisms are identical with those isolated from the blood\r\nor other parts of the animal. This is to be expected, however, for\r\nbecause of the feeble resistance of the fetus to any infection, the\r\norganisms circulating in the blood may be isolated, as a rule, from many\r\ndifferent organs and tissues. All samples of blood set with _Bact.\r\nabortum_ antigen were negative, irrespective of whether or not the\r\norganism was recovered from the blood or other tissues. This is in\r\naccordance with the findings of Carpenter in the female fetus,—the\r\nresistance is so feeble that few or no antibodies are formed to combat\r\nany existing infection. _Bact. abortum_ was recovered in two cases from\r\nthe vesicles, and in four cases from the testes, but in each instance\r\nthe same organism was present in the blood or other tissues of the body.\r\n\r\nThe results from the tracts of the calves dying of calf infections are\r\ngiven in Group V, and show that five were negative. The other two showed\r\n_B. coli_, staphylococci, and streptococci, in the organs indicated by\r\nthe chart.\r\n\r\nIn Group VI, the mature infertile or sterile bulls, there was a\r\ncomparatively wide variation in the type of organisms encountered, but\r\nstreptococci and micrococci were the most common invaders. In the order\r\nof the frequency of infection, the organs would be enumerated as\r\nfollows: Vesicles, epididymis (usually the tail), scrotal sac, testes,\r\nprostate, and Cowper’s glands. The first three parts mentioned usually\r\ncontained bacteria. A streptococcus was the usual invader of the scrotal\r\nsac, and very probably was the cause of the connective tissue tufts and\r\nstrands so frequently seen. The vesicles and epididymes gave, in the\r\norder of the frequency of their occurrence, staphylococci, streptococci,\r\n_B. coli_, and _Ps. pyocyaneus_. The streptococci were usually of the\r\nviridans group, though a few were hemolytic, and two strains were\r\nindifferent to blood. The testes gave growths in only eleven\r\ninstances,—staphylococci eight times, streptococci two times, and an\r\nunidentified rod once. The prostate yielded staphylococci twice and\r\nCowper’s gland once.\r\n\r\nAs emphasized previously, the vesicles and tail of the epididymis are\r\nmost subject to infection and degenerative changes. At the same time,\r\nthey are intimately connected with the secretion of the semen. Once the\r\nepididymis becomes infected, there is nothing to prevent the organisms,\r\ntogether with inflammatory products, from being mixed with the semen and\r\nejaculated during coitus. Also in the vesicles, unless the inflammation\r\nis so severe as to occlude the excretory duct, the organisms are mixed\r\nwith the vesicular secretion, which is emptied into the urethra during\r\nejaculation. Carried along with the bacteria, are, of course, toxic\r\nproducts, degenerated cells, and the otherwise altered secretion of the\r\nglands. One interesting case noted was that of a bull that had passed\r\nfrom a state of fertility to that of complete sterility during a period\r\nof two months. The semen was semi-fluid, greenish yellow in color, and\r\ncontained a very few non-motile spermatozoa. Post mortem examination\r\nshowed that the vesicles had undergone abscess formation and that they\r\ncontained yellowish green material similar to that which had been\r\ndischarged during copulation. _Streptococcus hemolyticus_ and _Ps.\r\npyocyaneus_ were isolated from both vesicles, and from the semen.\r\n_Micrococcus albus_ was isolated in nearly all cases of vesiculitis and\r\nwas often associated with _Streptococcus viridans_ or _hemolyticus_.\r\n\r\nBacteriological studies of the semen are, on the whole, more or less\r\nunsatisfactory, due to the present difficulty in obtaining samples free\r\nfrom any chance of contamination. In most of the abnormal bulls,\r\nbacteria of various types were isolated from the semen, most of which\r\nagreed culturally with those later isolated from the internal genital\r\norgans of the same tracts. The method of culturing consisted of douching\r\nthe prepuce of the bull and vagina of the female with sterile saline\r\nsolution before breeding. Samples of vaginal mucus were taken before\r\nservice, and the flora compared to that after douching. This method of\r\ndouching produced vaginal samples relatively free from bacteria, at\r\nleast so much so that the post coital fluid demonstrated that many\r\norganisms must have been introduced from without. Whether or not they\r\ncame in with the semen is problematical, but in all probability this was\r\nthe method of introduction.\r\n\r\nI have so far failed to obtain _Bact. abortum_ from the tract of an\r\nadult animal, either by direct culture or guinea pig inoculation, except\r\nfrom the testicle of one abattoir bull. The agglutination tests with\r\n_Bact. abortum_ antigen were all negative, except for two abattoir\r\nbulls. The results so far obtained would seem to indicate that, in\r\naccordance with the findings of other workers, the Bang organism seldom\r\ninvades the male genital tract, or does not thrive there after its\r\nintroduction. Schroeder (12) and others, have, however, on various\r\noccasions, recovered the organism from the bull, and the former author\r\neven states that it invades the vesicles and is eliminated with the\r\nsemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nA complete discussion of those factors which have a bearing on\r\nreproduction and fertility in an animal, includes not only a thorough\r\nstudy of the genital tract, but an appreciative consideration of various\r\nextrinsic factors. The effect of environment has long been known to have\r\na marked influence upon breeding, particularly with reference to animals\r\nin domestication. Diet, though long relegated to a minor phase of the\r\nquestion, has, within recent years, come to be a matter of prime\r\nimportance with regard to its bearing upon the entire body metabolism.\r\nThe endocrine organs preside over and regulate the growth and\r\nfunctioning of the genital organs from the earliest embryonic stage to\r\nthe cessation of sexual life. Any derangement in one results in\r\nfunctional or organic changes in the other. In a given mating, we must\r\ntake into consideration such factors as impediments to coitus, as well\r\nas those numerous agencies in the female which may interfere with the\r\nunion of sperm and ovum, or with the successful implantation of the\r\nfertilized egg in the uterus, and its growth and development there till\r\nnormal parturition takes place. Successful reproduction depends upon the\r\nmating of sexually sound females to equally sound males. Considering the\r\nvarious factors which govern reproduction, sexual soundness must\r\nnecessarily depend, to a large extent, upon a good general condition of\r\nthe entire body.\r\n\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENT: The effect of environment on fertility in the bull is no\r\ndoubt a minor factor. Cases in which changes in environment affect\r\nfertility probably occur, however, particularly when fear and other\r\npsychic disturbances play a part. Marshall (29) states: “It would seem\r\nprobable that failure to breed among animals in a strange environment is\r\ndue not, as has been suggested, to any toxic influence on the organs of\r\ngeneration, but to the same causes as those which restrict breeding in a\r\nstate of nature to certain particular seasons, and that the sexual\r\ninstinct can only be called into play in response to certain\r\nstimuli,—the existence of which depends to a large extent upon\r\nappropriate seasonal and climatic changes.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDIET: Under this heading we may include not only the effect of deficient\r\nfood, but also constitutional disorders, as a result of which the organs\r\nof generation and those glands guarding their function receive\r\ninsufficient nourishment. It is a well known fact, and long has been,\r\nthat animals fail to breed when they are in a run down condition or when\r\nthey are fed a deficient diet. Cary (35), quoting Hagner, states that\r\nthe virility of the spermatozoa is often in direct proportion to the\r\ngeneral physical condition of the patient.\r\n\r\nReynolds (34) emphasizes the fact that it is an established principle\r\namong animal breeders that a high protein diet in both sexes is\r\nessential to full fertility. “Oligospermia with deficient vitality of\r\nthe spermatozoa is not infrequently found from constitutional disorders.\r\nIt can easily be demonstrated in animals that both low diet and\r\nconditions of life that produce a nervous excitable state are attended\r\nby oligospermia.” Animals that are closely confined, those that are\r\nover-fat (show animals), as well as those fed a deficient ration very\r\nfrequently fail to breed, but exercise and change of diet soon overcome\r\nthe impotency.\r\n\r\nDutscher, Hart, Steenbock, and other biological chemists have done\r\nextensive work to show the essential importance of vitamines and\r\nminerals in the diet. Their results indicate that animals cannot thrive\r\nand breed normally when fed a diet composed solely of the products of\r\none plant. There must be variety, and there must be not only a correct\r\nnutritive ratio, but the mineral and vitamine content must be present as\r\nwell. Cows fed on the products of one plant often failed to breed, and\r\nif conception occurred, it invariably resulted in a premature birth, or\r\nthe birth of weak and poorly nourished calves. The work of these authors\r\nis fundamental, and brings out many important points. Is it not probable\r\nthat the deficient diet results in weakened tissues which are easier\r\nprey to the invasion of bacteria?\r\n\r\nMacomber and Reynolds (39) experimented upon white rats to determine the\r\neffect of defective diet as a cause of sterility. They call attention to\r\nthe confusion caused by the application of the term sterility to most,\r\nor all, infertile matings. They believe that failure of reproduction is,\r\nin fact, the result of decreased fertility rather than of actual\r\nsterility on the part of the two individuals concerned. “There are\r\ncertainly a large number of infertile matings which are purely\r\nfunctional and due to physiologic alterations or local conditions. Such\r\nphysiological alterations moreover coexist in the sterilities of\r\npathologic origin and when unrecognized and consequently unremedied,\r\nundoubtedly explain a large proportion of the continued infertilities\r\nafter operation.” Is it possible for a bull to be infertile to the cows\r\nin his herd that have been fed a deficient diet, and at the same time to\r\nbreed well when mated to animals outside this herd? This is rather\r\nimprobable in practice, but there is always the possibility of its\r\noccurrence. In the experimental work, white rats were used: one strain\r\nfrom the Wistar Institute with a fertility of about 65 per cent, and the\r\nother from a Dr. Castle’s strain with a fertility of about 90 per cent.\r\nThe Wistar rats were fed in groups, each group receiving a diet\r\ndeficient in a certain substance: calcium, protein, or fat soluble\r\nvitamine. To this group was added a diet deficient in both calcium and\r\nprotein (war diet). These diets reduced the fertility of the groups from\r\nthe original 65 per cent, to 55, 31, and 14 per cent respectively. It\r\ndelayed the appearance of fertility in young rats raised on these diets,\r\nand lowered its degree in the mature animals. Most of these rats,\r\nhowever, though infertile to each other, bred promptly when mated to the\r\nCastle rats of known fertility. This demonstrates clearly that relative\r\ninfertility of given matings does occur. One interesting feature of the\r\nwork is the fact that in the matings on the single deficiency diets,\r\nfour deliveries of macerated fetuses occurred and there were two more in\r\neight deliveries from those reared on the war diet. No cases of this\r\nkind had previously occurred in this strain, which had been under\r\nobservation for several years. Does this throw any light upon the cause\r\nof macerated fetuses in cattle? Microscopically the testes and ovaries\r\nof these infertile rats showed no observable changes, a fact which is of\r\ngreat importance to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nWilliams, in his book on disease of the genital organs, brings out quite\r\nclearly the relation of defective diet, overfeeding, and lack of\r\nexercise, to reproductive efficiency.\r\n\r\nNovarro (40) observed that pigeons fed on a diet without vitamine B\r\nshowed degeneration of the seminal epithelium, with hypertrophy and\r\nhyperplasia of the interstitial cells of the testis. Another author\r\n(Allen) showed that reduction in the quantity of water-soluble vitamine\r\nin the diet of rats resulted in total degeneration of all the germ\r\ncells, but it did not interfere with growth and development in other\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Williams (41), in a pure bred beef herd in Hawaii,\r\nclearly demonstrate the intimate correlation between poor fodder as the\r\nresult of extreme drought, and the accentuation of, or increased\r\nsusceptibility to, genital infections, as demonstrated by clinical\r\nfindings. The genital disorders started soon after the onset of the\r\ndrought, and immediately took a downward trend with the advent of the\r\nrainy season.\r\n\r\nJudging by the work quoted, we will observe that deficient diet, though\r\nit does not always affect the general health, has a profound effect upon\r\nthe genital organs of both sexes, associated with disturbances of\r\nspermatogenesis in the male. In most debilitated and weakened conditions\r\nof the male, spermatogenesis ceases or is markedly defective. We must,\r\nundoubtedly, explain this fact upon the ground of deficient nourishment\r\nto the reproductive organs or possibly the endocrines. The vitamines\r\nhave been termed nuclear nourishers, and their absence probably results\r\nin nuclear deficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDOCRINES: Bell (42) emphasizes the fact that not only the structure\r\nbut also the function of every part of the body is in close correlation\r\nwith the rest. “This is essentially true of the ductless glands: the\r\nshadow of their influence is over all.” Further he states that when we\r\nremember that the individual exists to perpetuate the species, it is not\r\ndifficult to realize that the metabolic factors concerned in\r\nreproduction are the same as those related to the individual metabolism.\r\nIt follows, therefore, that the ductless glands which regulate the\r\nindividual metabolism concern equally the reproductive. Brown (43),\r\ndiscussing the same subject brings out the generalization that the\r\nsympathetic, since it is the most primitive part of the nervous system,\r\nis closely associated with the endocrine system, a still more elemental\r\nmeans of communication in the body. Also since specialized reproductive\r\ncells appear before the nervous system, the organs of reproduction\r\nremain closely associated with the older chemical reactions now\r\nspecialized in the endocrine glands. “The endocrine glands, the\r\nreproductive organs, and the sympathetic nervous system, therefore,\r\nremain as a basic tripod, and it is not likely that a disturbance will\r\noccur for long in one limb without affecting the other two.” The former\r\nauthor believes that the gonad keeps the other ductless glands informed\r\nof the needs of the genital tract, they in turn influencing the general\r\nmetabolism. Jump (44) states: “We are therefore justified in believing\r\nthat there is a correlation of function between these (endocrine) glands\r\nand that some cases of sterility are probably due to a derangement of\r\nthis correlation.” Biedl (45) concludes: “There appears to be an\r\nintimate anatomical and physiological interrelationship between the\r\ndifferent blood glands which is manifested clinically by the fact that\r\nthe pathological disturbance of one gland is accompanied by symptoms\r\npointing to the functional derangement of one or more of the others.\r\nKnowing, as we do, the many sided interactivity which subsists between\r\nthe different internal secretory organs, it is readily conceivable that\r\nisolated diseases of single organs of this group are very much rarer\r\nthan, at the first glance, they would appear to be. In the present state\r\nof our knowledge, the only course of investigation which is open to us\r\nis to start with the known results of the functional derangement of any\r\norgan, and, by following these up, to seek the primary link in the\r\npathological chain.”\r\n\r\nMost workers seem to agree that a special connection exists between the\r\nnormal function of the adrenal cortex and the sexual organs. Tumors of\r\nthe former are usually associated with sex abnormalities, and feeding\r\nyoung animals the gland substance seems to stimulate growth of the\r\ntestes.\r\n\r\nMany arguments have been brought forward to show that the prostate\r\nproduces an internal secretion. It is a well known fact that this organ\r\natrophies after castration, and enlarges as the sex life dwindles. As\r\nhas been previously stated, Serrlach and Pares reached the conclusion\r\nthat the gland produces an internal secretion which controls the\r\ntesticular functions and regulates the process of ejaculation. Also they\r\nstate that if the prostate is removed, spermatozoa are no longer\r\nproduced in the testes, and that the secretory activity of the accessory\r\ngenital gland ceases. The secretion is, at any rate, a stimulus to the\r\ninternal secretion of the testis.\r\n\r\nThe thyroid bears a distinct biological relationship to the sexual\r\nglands. Removal of the gland results in imperfect development of the\r\ngonads, infantilism, and general torpor. Bell (42) believes that the\r\nassociation between the thyroid gland and the genitalia is as intimate\r\nas the relation of the pituitary to the genital functions.\r\n\r\nOf all the endocrines, perhaps the anterior lobe of the hypophysis is in\r\nmost intimate correlation with reproduction. Castration results in\r\nhypertrophy of this organ, while removal of the anterior lobe usually\r\nleads to death. In those cases in which death does not ensue, it results\r\nin genital atrophy, stunting, and reduction of sexual activity. In young\r\nanimals, spermatogenesis ceases entirely even after partial extirpation\r\nof the anterior lobe. Biedl (45) states that “in disease of the\r\nhypophysis, derangement of sexual activity occurs very early in the\r\ncourse of the disease, shown in women by the cessation of menstruation,\r\nand in men by impotence.”\r\n\r\nThe thymus, as is well known, is quite intimately associated with the\r\ndevelopment of the genital organs. Its normal disappearance is always\r\nassociated with the development of sexual maturity in the individual.\r\nHewer (46) conducted experiments to ascertain the effect of thymus\r\nfeeding on the activity of the reproductive organs in the rat. She\r\nconcludes in part: “Male rats appear more susceptible to the influence\r\nof thymus feeding than female rats. With moderate doses of thymus,\r\nsexual maturity in the animals treated is delayed, a phenomenon which is\r\nattributed to delayed development of the testis. With large doses of\r\nthymus, in the male, the testis is structurally affected: in the young\r\nanimal in the direction of retardation of development, in the mature\r\nanimal in the direction of degeneration. This degeneration is confined\r\nto the testes. In the degenerating testis, cells of Sertoli appear to be\r\nabsent: the spermatogonia are present, also dividing, and may lie free\r\nin the lumen of the tubule; spermatids, many with abnormal nuclei, are\r\nshed into the lumen in large numbers; spermatozoa are practically\r\nabsent. In the later stages, only a few dividing spermatogonia appear\r\namong the debris of the other unrecognizable cells of the tubule. In the\r\nepididymis which itself is normal, when the testis is showing\r\ndegeneration, very few spermatozoa appear, in the later stages none.\r\nMany spermatids are present in various stages, and some spermatocytes.\r\nAnimals in the hyper-thymic condition appear to be sterile.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing references will, I hope, serve to bring out the facts that\r\nenvironment and diet, together with the general body metabolism and the\r\nendocrines, have a more or less profound effect upon the development,\r\ngrowth, and functioning of the genital system. In the experiments it has\r\nbeen shown that sterility is not necessarily accompanied by any apparent\r\nmicroscopical changes in the gonads, or even at times in the general\r\nbody health. Nor can we exclude impotency of the male entirely even when\r\nthe spermatozoa are normal in shape, and motility. Carnett, and others\r\n(38), years ago stated: “Indeed, there is abundant clinical proof to the\r\neffect that systemic conditions which have no appreciable effect upon\r\nthe motility or conformation of the spermatozoa materially interfere\r\nwith reproductive power.” The entire complex genital system is\r\ninseparably linked up with the body as a whole, a fact which we must\r\nbear in mind at all times.\r\n\r\n_Impediments to coitus_ may be due to great difference in the size of\r\nthe two mated individuals, psychic disturbances, or inability to\r\nprotrude the penis. Williams (17) mentions several physical impediments,\r\nas deformity of the limbs or feet, sore feet, overloading of the rumen,\r\nobesity, fear of falling, and paralysis. Coitus may be somewhat delayed,\r\nor even not performed as the result of a severe inflammation with\r\nsensitiveness of the penis or prepuce. Occasionally tumors of the penis\r\nare encountered which may interfere with protrusion of the penis, or its\r\nentrance into the vagina. Not infrequently the penis is rendered\r\nincapable of protrusion as the result of inflammatory adhesions,\r\ntuberculosis of the preputial lymph glands, etc.\r\n\r\n_Excessive sexual use_, within certain limits, probably has not, in\r\nitself, any material permanent effect upon the reproductive capacity.\r\nThe frequency with which bulls used to excess break down sexually, is\r\nprobably due to the devitalizing effect upon the tissues of the genital\r\norgans, this opening the way to bacterial invasion and other destructive\r\ninfluences. Over-use is probably not dangerous, unless continued over\r\nlong periods, but at the same time it offers greater opportunity for\r\ninfection to be introduced into the body from intercourse with large\r\nnumbers of females. Lloyd-Jones and Hays (47) carried on very\r\ninteresting experiments on the influence of excessive sexual activity of\r\nmale rabbits on the properties of the semen. Their plan was to mate male\r\nrabbits in quick succession, and study the character of the semen on the\r\nfirst service, and every fifth service thereafter. The safe limit was\r\ntwenty services in three hours. As would be expected, the volume of the\r\nsemen, after the first few services, became gradually reduced in amount.\r\n“In rapidly successive services, the semen becomes less viscous and\r\ntends to lose its characteristic milky appearance until at the twentieth\r\nservice, when the fluid is thin and watery.” It seemed as though there\r\nwas a well marked reduction in the number of spermatozoa per cubic\r\ncentimeter in the advanced services. Successive copulations also\r\nresulted in a marked decrease in the number of motile spermatozoa,\r\ntogether with a shorter duration of perceptible vitality. The certainty\r\nof producing impregnation at the same time became less and less. “This\r\nreduction in the per cent of effective matings when the male is sexually\r\noverworked is recognized by those engaged in animal breeding as one of\r\nthe most noticeable and universal concomitants of heavy sexual service.”\r\n\r\nIn another paper, these same authors studied the effect of sexual excess\r\nupon the character of the offspring. In part, they conclude: “By no\r\nmeans thus far used has any inferiority of progeny from the heavy sexual\r\nservice been discovered. They are fully equal if not superior to progeny\r\nfrom very light service of male.”\r\n\r\n_Infection_ is without doubt the greatest single factor capable of\r\nproducing functional and anatomic changes resulting in varying degrees\r\nof impotency and sterility. The changes produced range from the addition\r\nof the toxic products of bacterial growth to the seminal fluid, to the\r\ncomplete destruction of the parenchymatous tissue of one or more of the\r\ncontributing sexual glands. Anatomic changes are by no means essential\r\nto the production of lowered fertility. As has been previously stated,\r\nthe work on veal calves indicates that the genital organs of young bulls\r\nare normally free from bacteria. Likewise in normal adult animals, the\r\nbacterial content of the genital organs is as a rule low or negative. It\r\nis possible that a certain flora is normal for the tract at sexual\r\nmaturity, as in several other organs of the body, but under the strain\r\nof sexual excess, defective diet, or other weakening influences, these\r\norganisms may become pathogenic. Streptococci and staphylococci have at\r\ntimes been found in apparently normal parts of the body, and at other\r\ntimes they are found associated with severe pathological lesions in the\r\ngenital tract. The degree of pathogenicity is of course difficult to\r\ndetermine, except as we find the bacteria associated with abnormal\r\nconditions. Carpenter (9), however, injected streptococci into the\r\ngenital tracts of female calves and produced lesions resembling very\r\nclosely those from which the organisms had been isolated in adult\r\nsterile animals. Personally, I am inclined to believe that the genital\r\norgans normally are free from bacteria, or if any are there they are\r\nbetter able to multiply under the strain of devitalization of the\r\ntissues. Bacterial invasion, however, does take place quite frequently,\r\nbut the paths of entrance of the organisms are somewhat problematical.\r\nHematogenous origin is always possible, though it is rather difficult to\r\ndefinitely implicate this mode of entrance. The urethra is perhaps the\r\neasiest and most common path for the entrance of bacteria, though even\r\nhere it is not possible to make definite assertions. Contiguous spread\r\nof infection from neighboring structures is very probable in some cases,\r\nparticularly in pelvic peritonitis. The bacteriological results hardly\r\nbear out the theory of Williams that the organisms lie dormant in the\r\ngenitalia of the animals until the advent of sexual maturity, at which\r\ntime they acquire pathogenic powers. On the other hand, his clinical\r\nobservations seem to indicate that this may be possible. Calves\r\nsuffering from “calf infections” frequently do harbor organisms in their\r\ngenital organs, but whether or not they persist there till sexual\r\nmaturity is a matter of conjecture. The most logical theory seems to be\r\nthat animals from herds in which genital infections are very severe, or\r\nthose that have had severe attacks of scours or pneumonia, are more\r\nsusceptible to those infections, due to the early lowering of their\r\nvitality. One bull in the department herd certainly had a severe ordeal\r\nas a calf, but as a mature bull he was highly fertile. Moderate sexual\r\nuse and proper sexual hygiene probably had much to do with this. In the\r\nbull, infection of some part of the genitals, during some period of\r\nlife, is very constant, however, whether or not it is productive of\r\nobservable changes in his breeding efficiency. The finding of the fine\r\nconnective tissue strands and tufts on the serous surface of the tail of\r\nthe epididymis of practically all bulls examined, both sterile and\r\nfertile, indicates past or present infection of the scrotal sac. The\r\nvesicles and tail of the epididymis are, as stated previously, the most\r\ncommonly invaded tissues of the tract. The testes are less frequently\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nWhile it is difficult to obtain irreproachable proof that the bull is a\r\ndisseminator of genital infections, the findings of clinicians quite\r\nclearly indicate that this is true, and laboratory methods tend to\r\nsupport this assumption. Williams believes that not only may the bull\r\ninfect the female with organisms which interfere with the given\r\nconception, but that he often implants there organisms which interfere\r\nwith future pregnancies, and even with the life of the individual in\r\nsome cases. The high abortion and sterility rate following the use of\r\ncertain sires, and the appearance of characteristic infections after\r\nservice to certain bulls, clearly indicate that in all probability the\r\nbull does eliminate with his semen those organisms which produce lesions\r\nin his genital organs, and are capable of infecting the female. W. L.\r\nWilliams (48) cites the case of a pure bred herd in which breeding had\r\nprogressed satisfactorily until heifers had grown to breeding age and a\r\nsecond bull was obtained. “Some cows of the old herd were also assigned\r\nto the young bull which had not previously been in service. The cows\r\nbred to the old herd bull continued to breed normally. The cows and\r\nheifer’s bred to the new bull conceived with difficulty or not at all.\r\nThose which conceived mostly aborted, and those which calved had\r\nmetritis and retained fetal membranes. The two first cows in which\r\npregnancy terminated died of metritis.” I have frequently had semen\r\nsamples sent in from bulls that were not only failing to get cows with\r\ncalf, but following each service the females showed a severe vaginitis.\r\nW. W. Williams worked in a herd in which service to certain bulls was in\r\neach case followed by a severe vaginitis and cervicitis, only to be\r\nfollowed later by a characteristic salpingitis.\r\n\r\nVaginal smears taken before and after service, in many instances, show\r\nthat in all probability bacteria, especially the streptococci, were\r\ndeposited there with the semen. These results have been obtained upon\r\nseveral occasions, at which time the vagina was usually douched prior to\r\neach service with sterile saline solution. Streptococci and other\r\norganisms have been isolated from the vaginal samples obtained by this\r\nmethod. In most cases, they were absent from samples taken before\r\nservice. Extraneous contamination, and error, must be taken into\r\nconsideration, but the results tend to bear out clinical observations\r\nthat the bull is probably a disseminator of some infections associated\r\nwith the genital organs of both sexes. At any rate, organisms have been\r\nisolated repeatedly from the genital organs of the bull, of the same\r\nbiological character as those which are associated with sterility,\r\nabortion, and allied phenomena in the female. In the absence of\r\nobstruction in any part of the tract, there is nothing to hinder\r\ninfection from gaining access to the seminal fluid, and being excreted\r\nduring ejaculation.\r\n\r\nHopper (18) states: “A diseased bull may manifest non-fertility or\r\ndecreased potency in different ways—by repeated service to apparently\r\nnormal females without conception, by a high abortion rate in females\r\nthat have been apparently normal, by characteristic infections following\r\nthe use of any particular sire, or by abnormalities in the breeding\r\ntract noted by rectal or physical palpation.”\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, _Bact. abortum_ has little affinity for the genitalia of the\r\nbull, though Schroeder states that the bull harbors the organisms in his\r\nseminal vesicles and that they are eliminated with the semen. Other\r\nauthors have occasionally isolated the organism from the vesicles,\r\ntestes, or both. Schroeder’s theory that infection of the female occurs\r\nindirectly by contamination of the fodder with the semen is probably\r\nrare in occurrence. The very limited number of cases in which\r\ninvestigators have demonstrated the presence of the organism in the male\r\ngenital organs, and the apparent immunity of the bull to the bacterium\r\nas determined by the agglutination reaction, seem to indicate that he\r\nplays a small part in the spread of this type of infection in the herd.\r\nOn the other hand, it would seem that he is at times intimately\r\nassociated with the spread of certain other organisms that interfere\r\nseriously with herd reproductivity.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of infertility and sterility rests upon a thorough\r\nphysical examination of the genital organs, together with a detailed\r\nstudy of the semen. The history of the animal and herd involved must\r\nalso be very carefully inquired into, especially the part covering the\r\nresult of every service by the sire in question. Besides this, we must\r\nalways consider all factors which have a bearing upon the subject,\r\nremembering the physiology of each part, and the role it plays in\r\nreproduction. Bacteria gain entrance to many parts of the tract, where\r\nthey multiply and probably add toxic products to the seminal fluid,\r\naltering its biological character and resulting in partial or total\r\ndestruction of the secretory tissues. The testes, epididymes, vesicles,\r\nprostate, and other parts, each contribute their essential part to the\r\nsemen, abnormalities of any one of which, as a rule, result in\r\ninterferences with reproduction. If the vesicles are involved, we must\r\nbear in mind just what is the part played by their secretion, and what\r\nis the probable result if their essential elements are not added to the\r\nsemen. In like manner, we must consider the prostate, whose secretion\r\nstimulates the vitality of the sperms, and adds fluid bulk to the semen.\r\nExtirpation of the vesicles or prostate alone results in lowered\r\nfertility, without altering the sexual desire, while removing both\r\nglands produces total sterility. Partial or total destruction of the\r\nparenchyma of either gland produces the same effect as extirpation, in\r\nthat its function is altered or entirely absent.\r\n\r\nThe semen should be examined, not only for the number of spermatozoa and\r\nthe percentage of those that are motile, but for the duration and type\r\nof motion. Normal semen, when first examined under the microscope, shows\r\na field closely packed with highly motile spermatozoa. In every study of\r\nthe semen, however, we must bear in mind the temperature and other\r\nconditions under which it has been kept since emission. On the other\r\nhand, semen from bulls of lowered fertility shows changes ranging from\r\nmild disturbances such as sluggish motility and a slight decrease in the\r\nnumber of sperms present, to aspermia, or total lack of motion. Normal\r\nsemen, when compared with abnormal specimens, as a rule presents\r\ndistinct differences, either in motility, staining properties, or\r\nstructure of the spermatozoa. Impotent bulls, however, may show at times\r\nfew or no observable changes in their genital organs. The only\r\nassumption here is that the condition probably is of endocrine origin,\r\nor is some functional disturbance. Of oligospermia Reynolds states:\r\n“Oligospermia, with normal motility and vitality, is not absolute\r\nsterility, but is of high importance because the percentage of\r\ndestruction of spermatozoa during their passage through the genital\r\ncanal of the female is so enormous that the possibility of impregnation\r\nby semen which starts out with a deficient number is always poor. When\r\nthe genitals of the female partner are in a condition which is even\r\nmoderately hostile to the spermatozoa, impregnation by such semen\r\nbecomes so unlikely as to be not even a probability.”\r\n\r\nMotility may be lacking in a small number, its absence may be observed\r\nin a large percentage, or even in all those in the field, as in\r\nnecrospermia. On the other hand, the motility may be sluggish or of\r\nabnormal types in variable percentages. Sperms with sluggish motility\r\nare always low in vitality, and have weak powers of insemination, as the\r\nmotion lasts but a comparatively short time. The vitality may be but\r\nmoderately lowered, so that although the sperms are highly motile when\r\nejaculated they soon lose their power of propulsion. The type of motion\r\nis likewise an indicator of lack of vitality. The “progressive\r\nvibratile” motion described by Reynolds should proceed to a high degree\r\nfor a long period before the “undulatory tactile” or bunting types of\r\nmotion appear. Early appearance of these two latter types indicates in\r\nmost cases a marked lack of vitality of the elements. The motion should\r\nbe vigorous and lasting, for, as stated by Reynolds, “nothing is more\r\ncertain than that spermatozoa of merely moderate vitality seldom\r\nimpregnate a female.”\r\n\r\nThe early precipitation out of the “Boettcherchen” crystals is very\r\ncharacteristic of oligospermia, and impotent semen. The theory here is\r\nthat crystals do not precipitate out when a fluid is actively moving,\r\nbut soon do so when the fluid is motionless. The sediment which normally\r\nmakes up about two-thirds of the sample is usually decreased in abnormal\r\nsamples. The semen itself should be observed for unusual viscosity or a\r\nthin watery condition. Clotting should occur readily after emission, but\r\nthe clot soon liquefies to some extent, allowing the spermatozoa to\r\nbecome more active. This clotting is, of course, to protect the delicate\r\nsperms from the hostile secretions of the vagina.\r\n\r\nThe presence of immature and deformed types of sperms represents some\r\ndisturbance of spermatogenesis, but it is difficult to explain the\r\nsignificance of these forms. They are seldom seen in normal samples, and\r\nundoubtedly none are capable of producing impregnation. In the case of\r\nminor abnormalities of staining reactions, the sperms are probably\r\ndeficient in nuclear material or otherwise altered so that probably they\r\nare incapable of reaching and uniting with the ovum. When impregnation\r\ndoes occur in these cases, weak offspring undoubtedly result in many\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nThe work has by no means progressed to the point where one may, by an\r\nexamination of the semen, determine the degree of impotency with great\r\naccuracy, or even whether the animal may be restored to sexual health by\r\nproper hygienic and therapeutic treatment. Relatively, the greater the\r\nchanges in the semen and spermatozoa, the less the chances of\r\nimpregnation. Infertility to any marked degree, is, however, usually\r\naccompanied by corresponding changes in the seminal fluid and its\r\ngerminal elements.\r\n\r\nExamination of the semen is, and probably always will be, simply an aid\r\nin reaching a diagnosis. While abnormalities of the semen and\r\nspermatozoa are associated with sterility or infertility, it is unwise\r\nto lay too much emphasis upon this method of diagnosis alone, especially\r\nwith regard to the making of a definite prognosis. When large numbers of\r\nabnormal spermatozoa are present in the semen, we are safe in saying\r\nthat the animal is, at the time, of lowered degree of fertility. One\r\nshould be very cautious, however, in foretelling how long the condition\r\nwill last, or if the animal may in time be restored to full fertility.\r\nSterility, due to organic disturbances, probably seldom yields to\r\ntreatment, but when it is due to functional disorders resulting from\r\ndefective diet or lack of exercise, the condition is frequently remedied\r\nby overcoming the cause. Lack of exercise and overfeeding seem to be\r\netiological factors in a fair percentage of cases.\r\n\r\nBesides abnormalities of the male genital tract, we must always consider\r\nthe numerous factors in the female that may kill or weaken the sperms.\r\nImpediments to successful coitus may be present in the form of vaginal\r\nconstrictions, abnormally short or small vagina, or other deformities.\r\nHostile exudates, mechanical obstructions, and other factors may\r\ninterrupt the progress of the sperms at any point in the tract.\r\n\r\nAlthough little is known definitely regarding disorders of the\r\nendocrines in the bull and their relation to reproduction, the work in\r\nhuman medicine and experimental researches upon laboratory animals\r\nwarrant thoughtful consideration of these factors which are by no means\r\ninsignificant. In the future, these glands will no doubt receive more\r\nand more attention in their relation to the genital organs and\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n1. The genital organs of the bull quite frequently undergo pathological\r\nchanges, due to infection with the same varieties of microorganisms\r\nassociated with genital infections in the female.\r\n\r\n2. In all probability, these microorganisms are frequently eliminated\r\nwith the semen and infect the female during copulation.\r\n\r\n3. Past or present infection in the genital organs of all the bulls so\r\nfar examined was evidenced by the presence of the fine connective tissue\r\ntufts and strands upon the tunica vaginalis, particularly that part\r\ncovering the tail of the epididymis.\r\n\r\n4. Lowered sexual capacity is, as a rule, accompanied by demonstrable\r\nchanges in the semen.\r\n\r\n5. A study of impotency and sterility includes not only a thorough study\r\nof the genital organs, but also those extrinsic factors which govern\r\nreproduction either directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\n6. A thorough knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the male\r\ngenital organs is fundamental to a clear understanding of the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I am much indebted to Drs. W. L. and W. W.
