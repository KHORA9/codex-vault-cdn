In the West the change has been so swift\r\nand spectacular as to approach a complete metamorphosis. With the\r\npassing of the frontier has gone something of the old freedom and the\r\nold opportunity; and the inevitable change has brought forth inevitable\r\nprotest, particularly from the agricultural class. Simple farming\r\ncommunities have wakened to find themselves complex industrial regions\r\nin which the farmers have frequently lost their former preferred\r\nposition. The result has been a series of radical agitations on the part\r\nof farmers determined to better their lot. These movements have\r\nmanifested different degrees of coherence and intelligence, but all have\r\nhad something of the same purpose and spirit, and all may justly be\r\nconsidered as stages of the still unfinished agrarian crusade. This book\r\nis an attempt to sketch the course and to reproduce the spirit of that\r\ncrusade from its inception with the Granger movement, through the\r\nGreenback and Populist phases, to a climax in the battle for free\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of the chapters dealing with Populism I received\r\ninvaluable assistance from my colleague, Professor Lester B. Shippee of\r\nthe University of Minnesota; and I am indebted to my wife for aid at\r\nevery stage of the work, especially in the revision of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nSolon J.

The clerk selected\r\nfor this mission, one Oliver Hudson Kelley, was something more than a\r\nmere collector of data and compiler of statistics: he was a keen\r\nobserver and a thinker. Kelley was born in Boston of a good Yankee\r\nfamily that could boast kinship with Oliver Wendell Holmes and Judge\r\nSamuel Sewall. At the age of twenty-three he journeyed to Iowa, where he\r\nmarried. Then with his wife he went on to Minnesota, settled in Elk\r\nRiver Township, and acquired some first-hand familiarity with\r\nagriculture. At the time of Kelley's service in the agricultural bureau\r\nhe was forty years old, a man of dignified presence, with a full beard\r\nalready turning white, the high broad forehead of a philosopher, and the\r\neager eyes of an enthusiast. \"An engine with too much steam on all the\r\ntime\"--so one of his friends characterized him; and the abnormal energy\r\nwhich he displayed on the trip through the South justifies the figure.\r\n\r\nKelley had had enough practical experience in agriculture to be\r\nsympathetically aware of the difficulties of farm life in the period\r\nimmediately following the Civil War. Looking at the Southern farmers not\r\nas a hostile Northerner would but as a fellow agriculturist, he was\r\nstruck with the distressing conditions which prevailed. It was not\r\nmerely the farmers' economic difficulties which he noticed, for such\r\ndifficulties were to be expected in the South in the adjustment after\r\nthe great conflict; it was rather their blind disposition to do as their\r\ngrandfathers had done, their antiquated methods of agriculture, and,\r\nmost of all, their apathy. Pondering on this attitude, Kelley decided\r\nthat it was fostered if not caused by the lack of social opportunities\r\nwhich made the existence of the farmer such a drear monotony that he\r\nbecame practically incapable of changing his outlook on life or his\r\nattitude toward his work.\r\n\r\nBeing essentially a man of action, Kelley did not stop with the mere\r\nobservation of these evils but cast about to find a remedy. In doing so,\r\nhe came to the conclusion that a national secret order of farmers\r\nresembling the Masonic order, of which he was a member, might serve to\r\nbind the farmers together for purposes of social and intellectual\r\nadvancement. After he returned from the South, Kelley discussed the plan\r\nin Boston with his niece, Miss Carrie Hall, who argued quite sensibly\r\nthat women should be admitted to full membership in the order, if it was\r\nto accomplish the desired ends. Kelley accepted her suggestion and went\r\nWest to spend the summer in farming and dreaming of his project. The\r\nnext year found him again in Washington, but this time as a clerk in the\r\nPost Office Department.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer and fall of 1867 Kelley interested some of his\r\nassociates in his scheme. As a result seven men--\"one fruit grower and\r\nsix government clerks, equally distributed among the Post Office,\r\nTreasury, and Agricultural Departments\"--are usually recognized as the\r\nfounders of the Patrons of Husbandry, or, as the order is more commonly\r\ncalled, the Grange. These men, all of whom but one had been born on\r\nfarms, were O. H. Kelley and W. M. Ireland of the Post Office\r\nDepartment, William Saunders and the Reverend A. B. Grosh of the\r\nAgricultural Bureau, the Reverend John Trimble and J. R. Thompson of the\r\nTreasury Department, and F. M. McDowell, a pomologist of Wayne, New\r\nYork. Kelley and Ireland planned a ritual for the society; Saunders\r\ninterested a few farmers at a meeting of the United States Pomological\r\nSociety in St. Louis in August, and secured the coöperation of McDowell;\r\nthe other men helped these four in corresponding with interested farmers\r\nand in perfecting the ritual. On December 4, 1867, having framed a\r\nconstitution and adopted the motto Esto perpetua, they met and\r\nconstituted themselves the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry.\r\nSaunders was to be Master; Thompson, Lecturer; Ireland, Treasurer; and\r\nKelley, Secretary.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, in view of the subsequent political activity\r\nin which the movement for agricultural organization became inevitably\r\ninvolved, that the founders of the Grange looked for advantages to come\r\nto the farmer through intellectual and social intercourse, not through\r\npolitical action. Their purpose was \"the advancement of agriculture,\"\r\nbut they expected that advancement to be an educative rather than a\r\nlegislative process. It was to that end, for instance, that they\r\nprovided for a Grange \"Lecturer,\" a man whose business it was to prepare\r\nfor each meeting a program apart from the prescribed ritual--perhaps a\r\npaper read by one of the members or an address by a visiting speaker.\r\nWith this plan for social and intellectual advancement, then, the\r\nfounders of the Grange set out to gain members.\r\n\r\nDuring the first four years the order grew slowly, partly because of the\r\nmistakes of the founders, partly because of the innate conservatism and\r\nsuspicion of the average farmer. The first local Grange was organized in\r\nWashington. It was made up largely of government clerks and their wives\r\nand served less to advance the cause of agriculture than to test the\r\nritual. In February, 1868, Kelley resigned his clerkship in the Post\r\nOffice Department and turned his whole attention to the organization of\r\nthe new order. His colleagues, in optimism or irony, voted him a salary\r\nof two thousand dollars a year and traveling expenses, to be paid from\r\nthe receipts of any subordinate Granges he should establish. Thus\r\nauthorized, Kelley bought a ticket for Harrisburg, and with two dollars\r\nand a half in his pocket, started out to work his way to Minnesota by\r\norganizing Granges. On his way out he sold four dispensations for the\r\nestablishment of branch organizations--three for Granges in Harrisburg,\r\nColumbus, and Chicago, which came to nothing, and one for a Grange in\r\nFredonia, New York, which was the first regular, active, and permanent\r\nlocal organization. This, it is important to note, was established as a\r\nresult of correspondence with a farmer of that place, and in by far the\r\nsmallest town of the four. Kelley seems at first to have made the\r\nmistake of attempting to establish the order in the large cities, where\r\nit had no native soil in which to grow.\r\n\r\nWhen Kelley revised his plan and began to work from his farm in\r\nMinnesota and among neighbors whose main interest was in agriculture, he\r\nwas more successful. His progress was not, however, so marked as to\r\ninsure his salary and expenses; in fact, the whole history of these\r\nearly years represents the hardest kind of struggle against financial\r\ndifficulties. Later, Kelley wrote of this difficult period: \"If all\r\ngreat enterprises, to be permanent, must necessarily start from small\r\nbeginnings, our Order is all right. Its foundation was laid on solid\r\nnothing--the rock of poverty--and there is no harder material.\" At times\r\nthe persistent secretary found himself unable even to buy postage for\r\nhis circular letters. His friends at Washington began to lose interest\r\nin the work of an order with a treasury \"so empty that a five-cent stamp\r\nwould need an introduction before it would feel at home in it.\" Their\r\nonly letters to Kelley during this trying time were written to remind\r\nhim of bills owed by the order. The total debt was not more than $150,\r\nyet neither the Washington members nor Kelley could find funds to\r\nliquidate it. \"My dear brother,\" wrote Kelley to Ireland, \"you must not\r\nswear when the printer comes in.... When they come in to 'dun' ask them\r\nto take a seat; light your pipe; lean back in a chair, and suggest to\r\nthem that some plan be adopted to bring in ten or twenty members, and\r\nthus furnish funds to pay their bills.\" A note of $39, in the hands of\r\none Mr. Bean, caused the members in Washington further embarrassment at\r\nthis time and occasioned a gleam of humor in one of Kelley's letters.\r\nBean's calling on the men at Washington, he wrote, at least reminded\r\nthem of the absentee, and to be cursed by an old friend was better than\r\nto be forgotten. \"I suggest,\" he continued, \"that Granges use black and\r\nwhite Beans for ballots.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of all his difficulties, Kelley stubbornly continued his\r\nendeavor and kept up the fiction of a powerful central order at the\r\ncapital by circulating photographs of the founders and letters which\r\nspoke in glowing terms of the great national organization of the Patrons\r\nof Husbandry. \"It must be advertised as vigorously as if it were a\r\npatent medicine,\" he said; and to that end he wrote articles for leading\r\nagricultural papers, persuaded them to publish the constitution of the\r\nGrange, and inserted from time to time press notices which kept the\r\norganization before the public eye. In May, 1868, came the first fruits\r\nof all this correspondence and advertisement--the establishment of a\r\nGrange at Newton, Iowa. In September, the first permanent Grange in\r\nMinnesota, the North Star Grange, was established at St. Paul with the\r\nassistance of Colonel D. A. Robertson. This gentleman and his associates\r\ninterested themselves in spreading the order. They revised the Grange\r\ncirculars to appeal to the farmer's pocketbook, emphasizing the fact\r\nthat the order offered a means of protection against corporations and\r\nopportunities for coöperative buying and selling. This practical appeal\r\nwas more effective than the previous idealistic propaganda: two\r\nadditional Granges were established before the end of the year; a state\r\nGrange was constituted early in the next year; and by the end of 1869\r\nthere were in Minnesota thirty-seven active Granges. In the spring of\r\n1869 Kelley went East and, after visiting the thriving Grange in\r\nFredonia, he made his report at Washington to the members of the\r\nNational Grange, who listened perfunctorily, passed a few laws, and\r\nrelapsed into indifference after this first regular annual session.\r\n\r\nBut however indifferent the members of the National Grange might be as\r\nto the fate of the organization they had so irresponsibly fathered,\r\nKelley was zealous and untiring in its behalf. That the founders did not\r\ndeny their parenthood was enough for him; he returned to his home with\r\nhigh hopes for the future. With the aid of his niece he carried on an\r\nindefatigable correspondence which soon brought tangible returns. In\r\nOctober, 1870, Kelley moved his headquarters to Washington. By the end\r\nof the year the Order had penetrated nine States of the Union, and\r\ncorrespondence looking to its establishment in seven more States was\r\nwell under way. Though Granges had been planted as far east as Vermont\r\nand New Jersey and as far south as Mississippi and South Carolina, the\r\nlife of the order as yet centered in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin,\r\nIllinois, and Indiana. These were the only States in which, in its four\r\nyears of activity the Grange had really taken root; in other States only\r\nsporadic local Granges sprang up. The method of organization, however,\r\nhad been found and tested. When a few active subordinate Granges had\r\nbeen established in a State, they convened as a temporary state Grange,\r\nthe master of which appointed deputies to organize other subordinate\r\nGranges throughout the State. The initiation fees, generally three\r\ndollars for men and fifty cents for women, paid the expenses of\r\norganization--fifteen dollars to the deputy, and not infrequently a\r\nsmall sum to the state Grange. What was left went into the treasury of\r\nthe local Grange. Thus by the end of 1871 the ways and means of\r\nspreading the Grange had been devised. All that was now needed was some\r\nimpelling motive which should urge the farmers to enter and support the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nThe Rising Spirit of Unrest\r\n\r\nThe decade of the seventies witnessed the subsidence, if not the\r\nsolution, of a problem which had vexed American history for half a\r\ncentury--the reconciliation of two incompatible social and economic\r\nsystems, the North and the South. It witnessed at the same time the rise\r\nof another great problem, even yet unsolved--the preservation of\r\nequality of opportunity, of democracy, economic as well as political, in\r\nthe face of the rising power and influence of great accumulations and\r\ncombinations of wealth. Almost before the battle smoke of the Civil War\r\nhad rolled away, dissatisfaction with prevailing conditions both\r\npolitical and economic began to show itself.\r\n\r\nThe close of the war naturally found the Republican or Union party in\r\ncontrol throughout the North. Branded with the opprobrium of having\r\nopposed the conduct of the war, the Democratic party remained impotent\r\nfor a number of years; and Ulysses S. Grant, the nation's greatest\r\nmilitary hero, was easily elected to the presidency on the Republican\r\nticket in 1868. In the latter part of Grant's first term, however,\r\nhostility began to manifest itself among the Republicans themselves\r\ntoward the politicians in control at Washington. Several causes tended\r\nto alienate from the President and his advisers the sympathies of many\r\nof the less partisan and less prejudiced Republicans throughout the\r\nNorth. Charges of corruption and maladministration were rife and had\r\nmuch foundation in truth. Even if Grant himself was not consciously\r\ndishonest in his application of the spoils system and in his willingness\r\nto receive reward in return for political favors, he certainly can be\r\njustly charged with the disposition to trust too blindly in his friends\r\nand to choose men for public office rather because of his personal\r\npreferences than because of their qualifications for positions of trust.\r\n\r\nGrant's enemies declared, moreover, with considerable truth that the man\r\nwas a military autocrat, unfit for the highest civil position in a\r\ndemocracy. His high-handed policy in respect to Reconstruction in the\r\nSouth evoked opposition from those Northern Republicans whose critical\r\nsense was not entirely blinded by sectional prejudice and passion. The\r\nkeener-sighted of the Northerners began to suspect that Reconstruction\r\nin the South often amounted to little more than the looting of the\r\ngovernments of the Southern States by the greedy freedmen and the\r\nunscrupulous carpetbaggers, with the troops of the United States\r\nstanding by to protect the looters. In 1871, under color of necessity\r\narising from the intimidation of voters in a few sections of the South,\r\nCongress passed a stringent act, empowering the President to suspend the\r\nwrit of habeas corpus and to use the military at any time to suppress\r\ndisturbances or attempts to intimidate voters. This act, in the hands of\r\nradicals, gave the carpetbag governments of the Southern States\r\npractically unlimited powers. Any citizens who worked against the\r\nexisting administrations, however peacefully, might be charged with\r\nintimidation of voters and prosecuted under the new act. Thus these\r\nradical governments were made practically self-perpetuating. When their\r\ncorruption, wastefulness, and inefficiency became evident, many people\r\nin the North frankly condemned them and the Federal Government which\r\ncontinued to support them.\r\n\r\nThis dissatisfaction with the Administration on the part of Republicans\r\nand independents came to a head in 1872 in the Liberal-Republican\r\nmovement. As early as 1870 a group of Republicans in Missouri, disgusted\r\nby the excesses of the radicals in that State in the proscription of\r\nformer Confederate sympathizers, had led a bolt from the party, had\r\nnominated B. Gratz Brown for governor, and, with the assistance of the\r\nDemocrats, had won the election. The real leader of this movement was\r\nSenator Carl Schurz, under whose influence the new party in Missouri\r\ndeclared not only for the removal of political disabilities but also for\r\ntariff revision and civil service reform and manifested opposition to\r\nthe alienation of the public domain to private corporations and to all\r\nschemes for the repudiation of any part of the national debt. Similar\r\nsplits in the Republican party took place soon afterwards in other\r\nStates, and in 1872 the Missouri Liberals called a convention to meet at\r\nCincinnati for the purpose of nominating a candidate for the presidency.\r\n\r\nThe new party was a coalition of rather diverse elements. Prominent\r\ntariff reformers, members of the Free Trade League, such as David A.\r\nWells and Edward L. Godkin of the Nation, advocates of civil service\r\nreform, of whom Carl Schurz was a leading representative, and especially\r\nopponents of the reconstruction measures of the Administration, such as\r\nJudge David Davis and Horace Greeley, saw an opportunity to promote\r\ntheir favorite policies through this new party organization. To these\r\nsincere reformers were soon added such disgruntled politicians as A. G.\r\nCurtin of Pennsylvania and R. E. Fenton of New York, who sought revenge\r\nfor the support which the Administration had given to their personal\r\nrivals. The principal bond of union was the common desire to prevent the\r\nreëlection of Grant. The platform adopted by the Cincinnati convention\r\nreflected the composition of the party. Opening with a bitter\r\ndenunciation of the President, it declared in no uncertain terms for\r\ncivil service reform and the immediate and complete removal of political\r\ndisabilities. On the tariff, however, the party could come to no\r\nagreement; the free traders were unable to overcome the opposition of\r\nHorace Greeley and his protectionist followers; and the outcome was the\r\nreference of the question \"to the people in their congressional\r\ndistricts and the decision of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe leading candidates for nomination for the presidency were Charles\r\nFrancis Adams, David Davis, Horace Greeley, Lyman Trumbull, and B. Gratz\r\nBrown. From these men, as a result of manipulation, the convention\r\nunhappily selected the one least suited to lead the party to\r\nvictory--Horace Greeley. The only hope of success for the movement was\r\nin coöperation with that very Democratic party whose principles,\r\npolicies, and leaders, Greeley in his editorials had unsparingly\r\ncondemned for years. His extreme protectionism repelled not only the\r\nDemocrats but the tariff reformers who had played an important part in\r\nthe organization of the Liberal Republican party. Conservatives of both\r\nparties distrusted him as a man with a dangerous propensity to advocate\r\n\"isms,\" a theoretical politician more objectionable than the practical\r\nman of machine politics, and far more likely to disturb the existing\r\nstate of affairs and to overturn the business of the country in his\r\nefforts at reform. As the Nation expressed it, \"Greeley appears to be\r\n'boiled crow' to more of his fellow citizens than any other candidate\r\nfor office in this or any other age of which we have record.\"\r\n\r\nThe regular Republican convention renominated Grant, and the Democrats,\r\nas the only chance of victory, swallowed the candidate and the platform\r\nof the Liberals. Doubtless Greeley's opposition to the radical\r\nreconstruction measures and the fact that he had signed Jefferson\r\nDavis's bail-bond made the \"crow\" more palatable to the Southern\r\nDemocrats. In the campaign Greeley's brilliant speeches were listened to\r\nwith great respect. His tour was a personal triumph; but the very voters\r\nwho hung eagerly on his speeches felt him to be too impulsive and\r\nopinionated to be trusted with presidential powers. They knew the worst\r\nwhich might be expected of Grant; they could not guess the ruin which\r\nGreeley's dynamic powers might bring on the country if he used them\r\nunwisely. In the end many of the original leaders of the Liberal\r\nmovement supported Grant as the lesser of two evils. The Liberal\r\ndefection from the Republican ranks was more than offset by the refusal\r\nof Democrats to vote for Greeley, and Grant was triumphantly reëlected.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Republican party was undoubtedly weakened by the unfortunate\r\nselection of their candidate, but it scarcely could have been victorious\r\nwith another candidate. The movement was distinctly one of leaders\r\nrather than of the masses, and the things for which it stood most\r\nspecifically--the removal of political disabilities in the South and\r\ncivil service reform--awakened little enthusiasm among the farmers of\r\nthe West. These farmers on the other hand were beginning to be very much\r\ninterested in a number of economic reforms which would vitally affect\r\ntheir welfare, such as the reduction and readjustment of the burden of\r\ntaxation, the control of corporations in the interests of the people,\r\nthe reduction and regulation of the cost of transportation, and an\r\nincrease in the currency supply. Some of these propositions occasionally\r\nreceived recognition in Liberal speeches and platforms, but several of\r\nthem were anathema to many of the Eastern leaders of that movement. Had\r\nthese leaders been gifted with vision broad enough to enable them to\r\nappreciate the vital economic and social problems of the West, the\r\nLiberal Republican movement might perhaps have caught the ground swell\r\nof agrarian discontent, and the outcome might then have been the\r\nformation of an enduring national party of liberal tendencies broader\r\nand more progressive than the Liberal Republican party yet less likely\r\nto be swept into the vagaries of extreme radicalism than were the\r\nAnti-Monopoly and Greenback parties of after years. A number of western\r\nLiberals such as A. Scott Sloan in Wisconsin and Ignatius Donnelly in\r\nMinnesota championed the farmers' cause, it is true, and in some States\r\nthere was a fusion of party organizations; but men like Schurz and\r\nTrumbull held aloof from these radical movements, while Easterners like\r\nGodkin of the Nation met them with ridicule and invective.\r\n\r\nThe period from 1870 to 1873 has been characterized as one of rampant\r\nprosperity, and such it was for the commercial, the manufacturing, and\r\nespecially the speculative interests of the country. For the farmers,\r\nhowever, it was a period of bitter depression. The years immediately\r\nfollowing the close of the Civil War had seen a tremendous expansion of\r\nproduction, particularly of the staple crops. The demobilization of the\r\narmies, the closing of war industries, increased immigration, the\r\nhomestead law, the introduction of improved machinery, and the rapid\r\nadvance of the railroads had all combined to drive the agricultural\r\nfrontier westward by leaps and bounds until it had almost reached the\r\nlimit of successful cultivation under conditions which then prevailed.\r\nAs crop acreage and production increased, prices went down in accordance\r\nwith the law of supply and demand, and farmers all over the country\r\nfound it difficult to make a living.\r\n\r\nIn the West and South--the great agricultural districts of the\r\ncountry--the farmers commonly bought their supplies and implements on\r\ncredit or mortgaged their crops in advance; and their profits at best\r\nwere so slight that one bad season might put them thereafter entirely in\r\nthe power of their creditors and force them to sell their crops on their\r\ncreditors' terms. Many farms were heavily mortgaged, too, at rates of\r\ninterest that ate up the farmers' profits. During and after the Civil\r\nWar the fluctuation of the currency and the high tariff worked especial\r\nhardship on the farmers as producers of staples which must be sold\r\nabroad in competition with European products and as consumers of\r\nmanufactured articles which must be bought at home at prices made\r\narbitrarily high by the protective tariff. In earlier times, farmers\r\nthus harassed would have struck their tents and moved farther west,\r\ntaking up desirable land on the frontier and starting out in a fresh\r\nfield of opportunity. It was still possible for farmers to go west, and\r\nmany did so but only to find that the opportunity for economic\r\nindependence on the edge of settlement had largely disappeared. The era\r\nof the self-sufficing pioneer was drawing to a close, and the farmer on\r\nthe frontier, forced by natural conditions over which he had no control\r\nto engage in the production of staples, was fully as dependent on the\r\nmarket and on transportation facilities as was his competitor in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1873 came the greatest panic in the history of the\r\nnation, and a period of financial depression began which lasted\r\nthroughout the decade, restricting industry, commerce, and even\r\nimmigration. On the farmers the blow fell with special severity. At the\r\nvery time when they found it most difficult to realize profit on their\r\nsales of produce, creditors who had hitherto carried their debts from\r\nyear to year became insistent for payment. When mortgages fell due, it\r\nwas well-nigh impossible to renew them; and many a farmer saw years of\r\nlabor go for nothing in a heart-breaking foreclosure sale. It was\r\ndifficult to get even short-term loans, running from seed-time to\r\nharvest. This important function of lending money to pay for labor and\r\nthus secure a larger crop, which has only recently been assumed by the\r\nGovernment in its establishment of farm loan banks, had been performed\r\nby private capitalists who asked usurious rates of interest. The\r\nfarmers' protests against these rates had been loud; and now, when they\r\nfound themselves unable to get loans at any rate whatever, their\r\ncomplaints naturally increased. Looking around for one cause to which to\r\nattribute all their misfortunes, they pitched upon the corporations or\r\nmonopolies, as they chose to call them, and especially upon the\r\nrailroads.\r\n\r\nAt first the farmers had looked upon the coming of the railroads as an\r\nunmixed blessing. The railroad had meant the opening up of new\r\nterritory, the establishment of channels of transportation by which they\r\ncould send their crops to market. Without the railroad, the farmer who\r\ndid not live near a navigable stream must remain a backwoodsman; he must\r\nmake his own farm or his immediate community a self-sufficing unit; he\r\nmust get from his own land bread and meat and clothing for his family;\r\nhe must be stock-raiser, grain-grower, farrier, tinker, soap-maker,\r\ntanner, chandler--Jack-of-all-trades and master of none. With the\r\nrailroad he gained access to markets and the opportunity to specialize\r\nin one kind of farming; he could now sell his produce and buy in\r\nexchange many of the articles he had previously made for himself at the\r\nexpense of much time and labor. Many farmers and farming communities\r\nbought railroad bonds in the endeavor to increase transportation\r\nfacilities; all were heartily in sympathy with the policy of the\r\nGovernment in granting to corporations land along the route of the\r\nrailways which they were to construct.\r\n\r\nBy 1873, however, the Government had actually given to the railroads\r\nabout thirty-five million acres, and was pledged to give to the Pacific\r\nroads alone about one hundred and forty-five million acres more. Land\r\nwas now not so plentiful as it had been in 1850, when this policy had\r\nbeen inaugurated, and the farmers were naturally aggrieved that the\r\nrailroads should own so much desirable land and should either hold it\r\nfor speculative purposes or demand for it prices much higher than the\r\nGovernment had asked for land adjacent to it and no less valuable.\r\nMoreover, when railroads were merged and reorganized or passed into the\r\nhands of receivers the shares held by farmers were frequently wiped out\r\nor were greatly decreased in value. Often railroad stock had been\r\n\"watered\" to such an extent that high freight charges were necessary in\r\norder to permit the payment of dividends. Thus the farmer might find\r\nhimself without his railroad stock, with a mortgage on his land which he\r\nhad incurred in order to buy the stock, with an increased burden of\r\ntaxation because his township had also been gullible enough to buy\r\nstock, and with a railroad whose excessive rates allowed him but a\r\nnarrow margin of profit on his produce.\r\n\r\nWhen the farmers sought political remedies for their economic ills, they\r\ndiscovered that, as a class, they had little representation or influence\r\neither in Congress or in the state legislatures. Before the Civil War\r\nthe Southern planter had represented agricultural interests in Congress\r\nfairly well; after the War the dominance of Northern interests left the\r\nWestern farmer without his traditional ally in the South. Political\r\npower was concentrated in the East and in the urban sections of the\r\nWest. Members of Congress were increasingly likely to be from the\r\nmanufacturing classes or from the legal profession, which sympathized\r\nwith these classes rather than with the agriculturists. Only about seven\r\nper cent of the members of Congress were farmers; yet in 1870\r\nforty-seven per cent of the population was engaged in agriculture. The\r\nonly remedy for the farmers was to organize themselves as a class in\r\norder to promote their common welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe Granger Movement at Flood Tide\r\n\r\nWith these real or fancied grievances crying for redress, the farmers\r\nsoon turned to the Grange as the weapon ready at hand to combat the\r\nforces which they believed were conspiring to crush them. In 1872 began\r\nthe real spread of the order. Where the Grange had previously reckoned\r\nin terms of hundreds of new lodges, it now began to speak of thousands.\r\nState Granges were established in States where the year before the\r\norganization had obtained but a precarious foothold; pioneer local\r\nGranges invaded regions which hitherto had been impenetrable. Although\r\nthe only States which were thoroughly organized were Iowa, Minnesota,\r\nSouth Carolina, and Mississippi, the rapid spread of the order into\r\nother States and its intensive growth in regions so far apart gave\r\npromise of its ultimate development into a national movement.\r\n\r\nThis development was, to be sure, not without opposition. When the\r\nGrangers began to speak of their function in terms of business and\r\npolitical coöperation, the forces against which they were uniting took\r\nalarm. The commission men and local merchants of the South were\r\nespecially apprehensive and, it is said, sometimes foreclosed the\r\nmortgages of planters who were so independent as to join the order. But\r\nhere, as elsewhere, persecution defeated its own end; the opposition of\r\ntheir enemies convinced the farmers of the merits of the Grange.\r\n\r\nIn the East, several circumstances retarded the movement. In the first\r\nplace, the Eastern farmer had for some time felt the Western farmer to\r\nbe his serious rival. The Westerner had larger acreage and larger yields\r\nfrom his virgin soil than the Easterner from his smaller tracts of\r\nwell-nigh exhausted land. What crops the latter did produce he must sell\r\nin competition with the Western crops, and he was not eager to lower\r\nfreight charges for his competitor. A second deterrent to the growth of\r\nthe order in the East was the organization of two Granges among the\r\ncommission men and the grain dealers of Boston and New York, under the\r\nægis of that clause of the constitution which declared any person\r\ninterested in agriculture to be eligible to membership in the order.\r\nThough the storm of protest which arose all over the country against\r\nthis betrayal to the enemy resulted in the revoking of the charters for\r\nthese Granges, the Eastern farmer did not soon forget the incident.\r\n\r\nThe year 1873 is important in the annals of the Grange because it marks\r\nthe retirement of the \"founders\" from power. In January of that year, at\r\nthe sixth session of the National Grange, the temporary organization of\r\ngovernment clerks was replaced by a permanent corporation, officered by\r\nfarmers. Kelley was reëlected Secretary; Dudley W. Adams of Iowa was\r\nmade Master; and William Saunders, erstwhile Master of the National\r\nGrange, D. Wyatt Aiken of South Carolina, and E. R. Shankland of Iowa\r\nwere elected to the executive committee. The substitution of alert and\r\neager workers, already experienced in organizing Granges, for the dead\r\nwood of the Washington bureaucrats gave the order a fresh impetus to\r\ngrowth. From the spring of 1873 to the following spring the number of\r\ngranges more than quadrupled, and the increase again centered mainly in\r\nthe Middle West.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1873 the Grange had penetrated all but four\r\nStates--Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Nevada--and there were\r\nthirty-two state Granges in existence. The movement was now well defined\r\nand national in scope, so that the seventh annual session of the\r\nNational Grange, which took place in St. Louis in February, 1874,\r\nattracted much interest and comment. Thirty-three men and twelve women\r\nattended the meetings, representing thirty-two state and territorial\r\nGranges and about half a million members. Their most important act was\r\nthe adoption of the \"Declaration of Purposes of the National Grange,\"\r\nsubscribed to then and now as the platform of the Patrons and copied\r\nwith minor modifications by many later agricultural organizations in the\r\nUnited States. The general purpose of the Patrons was \"to labor for the\r\ngood of our Order, our Country, and Mankind.\" This altruistic ideal was\r\nto find practical application in efforts to enhance the comfort and\r\nattractions of homes, to maintain the laws, to advance agricultural and\r\nindustrial education, to diversify crops, to systematize farm work, to\r\nestablish coöperative buying and selling, to suppress personal, local,\r\nsectional, and national prejudices, and to discountenance \"the credit\r\nsystem, the fashion system, and every other system tending to\r\nprodigality and bankruptcy.\" As to business, the Patrons declared\r\nthemselves enemies not of capital but of the tyranny of monopolies, not\r\nof railroads but of their high freight tariffs and monopoly of\r\ntransportation. In politics, too, they maintained a rather nice balance:\r\nthe Grange was not to be a political or party organization, but its\r\nmembers were to perform their political duties as individual citizens.\r\n\r\nIt could hardly be expected that the program of the Grange would satisfy\r\nall farmers. For the agricultural discontent, as for any other\r\ndissatisfaction, numerous panaceas were proposed, the advocates of each\r\nof which scorned all the others and insisted on their particular remedy.\r\nSome farmers objected to the Grange because it was a secret\r\norganization; others, because it was nonpartisan. For some the\r\norganization was too conservative; for others, too radical. Yet all\r\nthese objectors felt the need of some sort of organization among the\r\nfarmers, very much as the trade-unionist and the socialist, though\r\nwidely divergent in program, agree that the workers must unite in order\r\nto better their condition. Hence during these years of activity on the\r\npart of the Grange many other agricultural societies were formed,\r\ndiffering from the Patrons of Husbandry in specific program rather than\r\nin general purpose.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these societies were the farmers' clubs, at first\r\nmore or less independent of each other but later banded together in\r\nstate associations. The most striking differences of these clubs from\r\nthe Granges were their lack of secrecy and their avowed political\r\npurposes. Their establishment marks the definite entrance of the farmers\r\nas a class into politics. During the years 1872 to 1875 the independent\r\nfarmers' organizations multiplied much as the Granges did and for the\r\nsame reasons. The Middle West again was the scene of their greatest\r\npower. In Illinois this movement began even before the Grange appeared\r\nin the State, and its growth during the early seventies paralleled that\r\nof the secret order. In other States also, notably in Kansas, there\r\nsprang up at this time agricultural clubs of political complexion, and\r\nwhere they existed in considerable numbers they generally took the lead\r\nin the political activities of the farmers' movement. Where the Grange\r\nhad the field practically to itself, as in Iowa and Minnesota, the\r\nrestriction in the constitution of the order as to political or partisan\r\nactivity was evaded by the simple expedient of holding meetings \"outside\r\nthe gate,\" at which platforms were adopted, candidates nominated, and\r\nplans made for county, district, and state conventions.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the farmers hoped, by a show of strength, to achieve the\r\ndesired results through one or both of the old parties, but they soon\r\ndecided that they could enter politics effectively only by way of a\r\nthird party. The professional politicians were not inclined to espouse\r\nnew and radical issues which might lead to the disruption of party\r\nlines. The outcome, therefore, was the establishment of new parties in\r\neleven of the Western States during 1873 and 1874. Known variously as\r\nIndependent, Reform, Anti-Monopoly, or Farmers' parties, these\r\norganizations were all parts of the same general movement, and their\r\nplatforms were quite similar. The paramount demands were: first, the\r\nsubjection of corporations, and especially of railroad corporations, to\r\nthe control of the State; and second, reform and economy in government.\r\nAfter the new parties were well under way, the Democrats in most of the\r\nStates, being in a hopeless minority, made common cause with them in the\r\nhope of thus compassing the defeat of their hereditary rivals, the \r\nold-line Republicans. In Missouri, however, where the Democracy had been\r\nrestored to power by the Liberal-Republican movement, the new party\r\nreceived the support of the Republicans.\r\n\r\nIllinois, where the farmers were first thoroughly organized into clubs\r\nand Granges, was naturally the first State in which they took effective\r\npolitical action. The agitation for railroad regulation, which began in\r\nIllinois in the sixties, had caused the new state constitution of 1870\r\nto include mandatory provisions directing the legislature to pass laws\r\nto prevent extortion and unjust discrimination in railway charges. One\r\nof the acts passed by the Legislature of 1871 in an attempt to carry out\r\nthese instructions was declared unconstitutional by the state supreme\r\ncourt in January, 1873. This was the spark to the tinder. In the\r\nfollowing April the farmers flocked to a convention at the state capital\r\nand so impressed the legislators that they passed more stringent and\r\neffective laws for the regulation of railroads. But the politicians had\r\na still greater surprise in store for them. In the elections of judges\r\nin June, the farmers retired from office the judge who had declared\r\ntheir railroad law unconstitutional and elected their own candidates for\r\nthe two vacancies in the supreme court and for many of the vacancies in\r\nthe circuit courts.\r\n\r\nNow began a vigorous campaign for the election of farmers' candidates in\r\nthe county elections in the fall. So many political meetings were held\r\non Independence Day in 1873 that it was referred to as the \"Farmers'\r\nFourth of July.\" This had always been the greatest day of the farmer's\r\nyear, for it meant opportunity for social and intellectual enjoyment in\r\nthe picnics and celebrations which brought neighbors together in\r\nhilarious good-fellowship. In 1873, however, the gatherings took on\r\nunwonted seriousness. The accustomed spread-eagle oratory gave place to\r\nimpassioned denunciation of corporations and to the solemn reading of a\r\nFarmers' Declaration of Independence. \"When, in the course of human\r\nevents,\" this document begins in words familiar to every schoolboy\r\norator, \"it becomes necessary for a class of the people, suffering from\r\nlong continued systems of oppression and abuse, to rouse themselves from\r\nan apathetic indifference to their own interests, which has become\r\nhabitual ... a decent respect for the opinions of mankind requires that\r\nthey should declare the causes that impel them to a course so necessary\r\nto their own protection.\" Then comes a statement of \"self-evident\r\ntruths,\" a catalogue of the sins of the railroads, a denunciation of\r\nrailroads and Congress for not having redressed these wrongs, and\r\nfinally the conclusion:\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, the producers of the state in our several counties\r\nassembled ... do solemnly declare that we will use all lawful and\r\npeaceable means to free ourselves from the tyranny of monopoly, and that\r\nwe will never cease our efforts for reform until every department of our\r\nGovernment gives token that the reign of licentious extravagance is\r\nover, and something of the purity, honesty, and frugality with which our\r\nfathers inaugurated it, has taken its place.\r\n\r\nThat to this end we hereby declare ourselves absolutely free and\r\nindependent of all past political connections, and that we will give our\r\nsuffrage only to such men for office, as we have good reason to believe\r\nwill use their best endeavors to the promotion of these ends; and for\r\nthe support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on divine\r\nProvidence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes,\r\nand our sacred honor.\r\n\r\nThis fall campaign of 1873 in Illinois broke up old party lines in\r\nremarkable fashion. In some counties the Republicans and in other\r\ncounties the Democrats either openly joined the \"Reformers\" or refrained\r\nfrom making separate nominations. Of the sixty-six counties which the\r\nnew party contested, it was victorious in fifty-three. This first\r\nelection resulted in the best showing which the Reformers made in\r\nIllinois. In state elections, the new party was less successful; the\r\nfarmers who voted for their neighbors running on an Anti-Monopoly ticket\r\nfor lesser offices hesitated to vote for strangers for state office.\r\n\r\nOther Middle Western States at this time also felt the uneasy stirring\r\nof radical political thought and saw the birth of third parties, \r\nshort-lived, most of them, but throughout their brief existence crying\r\nloudly and persistently for reforms of all description. The tariff, the\r\ncivil service system, and the currency, all came in for their share of\r\ncriticism and of suggestions for revision, but the dominant note was a\r\nstrident demand for railroad regulation. Heirs of the Liberal\r\nRepublicans and precursors of the Greenbackers and Populists, these\r\nindependent parties were as voices crying in the wilderness, preparing\r\nthe way for national parties of reform. The notable achievement of the\r\nindependent parties in the domain of legislation was the enactment of\r\nlaws to regulate railroads in five States of the upper Mississippi\r\nValley. ¹ When these laws were passed, the parties had done their work.\r\nBy 1876 they had disappeared or, in a few instances, had merged with the\r\nGreenbackers. Their temporary successes had demonstrated, however, to\r\nboth farmers and professional politicians that if once solidarity could\r\nbe obtained among the agricultural class, that class would become the\r\ncontrolling element in the politics of the Middle Western States. It is\r\nnot surprising, therefore, that wave after wave of reform swept over the\r\nWest in the succeeding decades.\r\n\r\n¹ See Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nThe independent parties of the middle seventies were distinctly\r\nspontaneous uprisings of the people and especially of the farmers,\r\nrather than movements instigated by politicians for personal ends or by\r\nprofessional reformers. This circumstance was a source both of strength\r\nand weakness. As the movements began to develop unexpected power,\r\npoliticians often attempted to take control but, where they succeeded,\r\nthe movement was checked by the farmers' distrust of these \r\nself-appointed leaders. On the other hand, the new parties suffered from\r\nthe lack of skillful and experienced leaders. The men who managed their\r\ncampaigns and headed their tickets were usually well-to-do farmers\r\ndrafted from the ranks, with no more political experience than perhaps a\r\nterm or two in the state legislature. Such were Willard C. Flagg,\r\npresident of the Illinois State Farmers' Association, Jacob G. Vale,\r\ncandidate for governor in Iowa, and William R. Taylor, the Granger\r\ngovernor of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nTaylor is typical of the picturesque and forceful figures which frontier\r\nlife so often developed. He was born in Connecticut, of parents recently\r\nemigrated from Scotland. Three weeks after his birth his mother died,\r\nand six years later his father, a sea captain, was drowned. The orphan\r\nboy, brought up by strangers in Jefferson County, New York, experienced\r\nthe hardships of frontier life and developed that passion for knowledge\r\nwhich so frequently is found in those to whom education is denied. When\r\nhe was sixteen, he had, enough of the rudiments to take charge of a\r\ncountry school, and by teaching in the winter and working in the summer\r\nhe earned enough to enter Union College. He was unable to complete the\r\ncourse, however, and turned to teaching in Ohio, where he restored to\r\ndecent order a school notorious for bullying its luckless teachers. But\r\nteaching was not to be his career; indeed, Taylor's versatility for a\r\ntime threatened to make him the proverbial Jack-of-all-trades: he was\r\nemployed successively in a grist mill, a saw mill, and an iron foundry;\r\nhe dabbled in the study of medicine; and finally, in the year which saw\r\nWisconsin admitted to the Union, he bought a farm in that State.\r\nOwnership of property steadied his interests and at the same time\r\nafforded an adequate outlet for his energies. He soon made his farm a\r\nmodel for the neighborhood and managed it so efficiently that he had\r\ntime to interest himself in farmers' organizations and to hold positions\r\nof trust in his township and county.\r\n\r\nBy 1873 Taylor had acquired considerable local political experience and\r\nhad even held a seat in the state senate. As president of the State\r\nAgricultural Society, he was quite naturally chosen to head the ticket\r\nof the new Liberal Reform party. The brewing interests of the State,\r\nangered at a drastic temperance law enacted by the preceding\r\nlegislature, swung their support to Taylor. Thus reënforced, he won the\r\nelection. As governor he made vigorous and tireless attempts to enforce\r\nthe Granger railroad laws, and on one occasion he scandalized the\r\nconventional citizens of the State by celebrating a favorable court\r\ndecision in one of the Granger cases with a salvo of artillery from the\r\ncapitol.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of this prominence, Taylor, after his defeat for reëlection\r\nin 1875, retired to his farm and to obscurity. His vivid personality was\r\nnot again to assert itself in public affairs. It is difficult to account\r\nfor the fact that so few of the farmers during the Granger period played\r\nprominent parts in later phases of the agrarian crusade. The rank and\r\nfile of the successive parties must have been much the same, but each\r\nwave of the movement swept new leaders to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe one outstanding exception among the leaders of the Anti-Monopolists\r\nwas Ignatius Donnelly of Minnesota--\"the sage of Nininger\"--who remained\r\na captain of the radical cohorts in every agrarian movement until his\r\ndeath in 1901. A red-headed aggressive Irishman, with a magnetic\r\npersonality and a remarkable intellect, Donnelly went to Minnesota from\r\nPennsylvania in 1856 and speculated in town sites on a large scale. When\r\nhe was left stranded by the panic of 1857, acting upon his own principle\r\nthat \"to hide one's light under a bushel is to extinguish it,\" he\r\nentered the political arena. In Pennsylvania Donnelly had been a\r\nDemocrat, but his genuine sympathy for the oppressed made him an\r\nopponent of slavery and consequently a Republican. In 1857 and 1858 he\r\nran for the state senate in Minnesota on the Republican ticket in a\r\nhopelessly Democratic county. In 1859 he was nominated for lieutenant\r\ngovernor on the ticket headed by Alexander Ramsey; and his caustic wit,\r\nhis keenness in debate, and his eloquence made him a valuable asset in\r\nthe battle-royal between Republicans and Democrats for the possession of\r\nMinnesota. As lieutenant governor, Donnelly early showed his sympathy\r\nwith the farmers by championing laws which lowered the legal rate of\r\ninterest and which made more humane the process of foreclosure on\r\nmortgages. The outbreak of the Civil War gave him an opportunity to\r\ndemonstrate his executive ability as acting governor during Ramsey's\r\nfrequent trips to Washington. In this capacity he issued the first\r\nproclamation for the raising of Minnesota troops in response to the call\r\nof President Lincoln. Elected to Congress in 1862, he served three terms\r\nand usually supported progressive legislation.\r\n\r\nDonnelly's growing popularity and his ambition for promotion to the\r\nSenate soon became a matter of alarm to the friends of Senator Ramsey,\r\nwho controlled the Republican party in the State. They determined to\r\nprevent Donnelly's renomination in 1868 and selected William D. Washburn\r\nof Minneapolis to make the race against him. In the spring of this year\r\nDonnelly engaged in a controversy with Representative E. B. Washburn of\r\nIllinois, a brother of W. D. Washburn, in the course of which the\r\nIllinois congressman published a letter in a St. Paul paper attacking\r\nDonnelly's personal character. Believing this to be part of the campaign\r\nagainst him, the choleric Minnesotan replied in the house with a\r\nremarkable rhetorical display which greatly entertained the members but\r\ndid not increase their respect for him. His opponents at home made\r\neffective use of this affair, and the outcome of the contest was a\r\ndivided convention, the nomination of two Republicans, each claiming to\r\nbe the regular candidate of the party, and the ultimate election of a\r\nDemocrat.\r\n\r\nDonnelly was soon ready to break with the old guard of the Republican\r\nparty in national as well as in state politics. In 1870 he ran for\r\nCongress as an independent Republican on a low tariff platform but was\r\ndefeated in spite of the fact that he received the endorsement of the\r\nDemocratic convention. Two years later he joined the Liberal Republicans\r\nin supporting Greeley against Grant. When the farmers' Granges began to\r\nspring up like mushrooms in 1873, Donnelly was quick to see the\r\npolitical possibilities of the movement. He conducted an extensive\r\ncorrespondence with farmers, editors, and politicians of radical\r\ntendencies all over the State and played a leading part in the\r\norganization of the Anti-Monopoly party. He was elected to the state\r\nsenate in 1873, and in the following year he started a newspaper, the\r\nAnti-Monopolist, to serve as the organ of the movement.\r\n\r\nAlthough Donnelly was technically still a farmer, he was quite content\r\nto leave the management of his farm to his capable wife, while he made\r\npolitics his profession, with literature and lecturing as avocations.\r\nHis frequent and brilliant lectures no less than his voluminous writings\r\n¹ attest his amazing industry. Democrat, Republican, Liberal-Republican,\r\nand Anti-Monopolist; speculator, lawyer, farmer, lecturer, \r\nstump-speaker, editor, and author; preacher of morals and practicer of\r\nshrewd political evasions; and always a radical--he was for many years a\r\nforce to be reckoned with in the politics of his State and of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n¹ The Great Cryptogram, for instance, devotes a thousand pages to\r\nproving a Bacon cipher in the plays of Shakespeare!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCurbing the Railroads\r\n\r\nThough the society of the Patrons of Husbandry was avowedly\r\nnon-political in character, there is ample justification for the use of\r\nthe term \"Granger\" in connection with the radical railroad legislation\r\nenacted in the Northwestern States during the seventies. The fact that\r\nthe Grange did not take direct political action is immaterial: certainly\r\nthe order made political action on the part of the farmers possible by\r\nestablishing among them a feeling of mutual confidence and trust whereby\r\nthey could organize to work harmoniously for their common cause. Before\r\nthe advent of the Patrons of Husbandry the farmers were so isolated from\r\neach other that coöperation was impossible. It is hard for us to\r\nimagine, familiar as we are with the rural free delivery of mail, with\r\nthe country telephone line, with the automobile, how completely the\r\naverage farmer of 1865 was cut off from communication with the outside\r\nworld. His dissociation from any but his nearest neighbors made him\r\nunsocial, narrow-minded, bigoted, and suspicious. He believed that every\r\nman's hand was against him, and he was therefore often led to turn his\r\nhand against every man. Not until he was convinced that he might at\r\nleast trust the Grangers did he lay aside his suspicions and join with\r\nother farmers in the attempt to obtain what they considered just\r\nrailroad legislation.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, moreover, that the Grangers made use of the popular\r\nhostility to the railroads in securing membership for the order.\r\n\"Coöperation\" and \"Down with Monopoly\" were two of the slogans most\r\ncommonly used by the Grange between 1870 and 1875 and were in large part\r\nresponsible for its great expansion. Widely circulated reprints of\r\narticles exposing graft and corruption made excellent fuel for the\r\nflames of agitation.\r\n\r\nHow much of the farmers' bitterness against the railroads was justified\r\nit is difficult to determine. Some of it was undoubtedly due to\r\nprejudice, to the hostility of the \"producer\" for the \"nonproducer,\" and\r\nto the suspicion which the Western farmer felt for the Eastern magnate.\r\nBut much of the suspicion was not without foundation. In some cases\r\nmanipulation of railway stock had absolutely cheated farmers and\r\nagricultural towns and counties out of their investments. It is a \r\nwell-known fact that the corporations were not averse to creating among\r\nlegislators a disposition to favor their interests. Passes were commonly\r\ngiven by the railroads to all public officials, from the local\r\nsupervisors to the judges of the Supreme Court, and opportunities were\r\noffered to legislators to buy stock far below the market price. In such\r\nsubtle ways the railroads insinuated themselves into favor among the\r\nmakers and interpreters of law. Then, too, the farmers felt that the\r\nrailway companies made rates unnecessarily high and frequently practised\r\nunfair discrimination against certain sections and individuals. When the\r\nIowa farmer was obliged to burn corn for fuel, because at fifteen cents\r\na bushel it was cheaper than coal, though at the same time it was\r\nselling for a dollar in the East, he felt that there was something\r\nwrong, and quite naturally accused the railroads of extortion.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental issue involved in Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, and\r\nWisconsin, where the battle was begun and fought to a finish, was\r\nwhether or not a State had power to regulate the tariffs of railway\r\ncompanies incorporated under its laws. Railway companies, many jurists\r\nargued, were private concerns transacting business according to the laws\r\nof the State and no more to be controlled in making rates than dry goods\r\ncompanies in fixing the price of spools of thread; rates, like the price\r\nof merchandise, were determined by the volume of trade and the amount of\r\ncompetition, and for a State to interfere with them was nothing less\r\nthan tyranny. On the other hand, those who advocated regulation argued\r\nthat railroads, though private corporations, were from the nature of\r\ntheir business public servants and, as such, should be subject to state\r\nregulation and control.\r\n\r\nSome States, foreseeing difficulties which might arise later from the\r\ndoctrine that a charter is a contract, as set forth by the United States\r\nSupreme Court in the famous Dartmouth College case, ¹ had quite early in\r\ntheir history attempted to safeguard their right to legislate concerning\r\ncorporations. A clause had been inserted in the state constitution of\r\nWisconsin which declared that all laws creating corporations might at\r\nany time be altered or repealed by the legislatures. The constitution of\r\nMinnesota asserted specifically that the railroads, as common carriers\r\nenjoying right of way, were bound to carry freight on equal and\r\nreasonable terms. When the Legislature of Iowa turned over to the\r\nrailroad companies lands granted by the Federal Government, it did so\r\nwith the reservation that the companies should be subject to the rules\r\nand regulations of the General Assembly. Thus these States were\r\nfortified not only by arguments from general governmental theory but\r\nalso by written articles, more or less specifically phrased, on which\r\nthey relied to establish their right to control the railroads.\r\n\r\n¹ See John Marshall and the Constitution, by Edward S. Corwin (in The\r\nChronicles of America), p. 154 ff.\r\n\r\nThe first gun in this fight for railroad regulation was fired in\r\nIllinois. As early as 1869, after several years of agitation, the\r\nlegislature passed an act declaring that railroads should be limited to\r\n\"just, reasonable, and uniform rates,\" but, as no provision was made for\r\ndetermining what such rates were, the act was a mere encumbrance on the\r\nstatute books. In the new state constitution of 1870, however, the\r\nframers, influenced by a growing demand on the part of the farmers which\r\nmanifested itself in a Producers' Convention, inserted a section\r\ndirecting the legislature to \"pass laws to correct abuses and to prevent\r\nunjust discrimination and extortion in the rates of freight and\r\npassenger tariffs on the different railroads in this State.\" The\r\nlegislature at its next session appears to have made an honest attempt\r\nto obey these instructions. One act established maximum passenger fares\r\nvarying from two and one-half to five and one-half cents a mile for the\r\ndifferent classes into which the roads were divided. Another provided,\r\nin effect, that freight charges should be based entirely upon distance\r\ntraversed and prohibited any increases over rates in 1870. This amounted\r\nto an attempt to force all rates to the level of the lowest competitive\r\nrates of that year. Finally, a third act established a board of railroad\r\nand warehouse commissioners charged with the enforcement of these and\r\nother laws and with the collection of information.\r\n\r\nThe railroad companies, denying the right of the State to regulate their\r\nbusiness, flatly refused to obey the laws; and the state supreme court\r\ndeclared the act regulating freight rates unconstitutional on the ground\r\nthat it attempted to prevent not only unjust discrimination but any\r\ndiscrimination at all. The legislature then passed the Act of 1873,\r\nwhich avoided the constitutional pitfall by providing that\r\ndiscriminatory rates should be considered as prima facie but not\r\nabsolute evidence of unjust discrimination. The railroads were thus\r\npermitted to adduce evidence to show that the discrimination was\r\njustified, but the act expressly stated that the existence of\r\ncompetition at some points and its nonexistence at others should not be\r\ndeemed a sufficient justification of discrimination. In order to prevent\r\nthe roads from raising all rates to the level of the highest instead of\r\nlowering them to the level of the lowest, the commissioners were\r\ndirected to establish a schedule of maximum rates; and the charging of\r\nrates higher than these by any company after January 15, 1874, was to be\r\nconsidered prima facie evidence of extortion. Other provisions increased\r\nthe penalties for violations and strengthened the enforcing powers of\r\nthe commission in other ways. This act was roundly denounced at the\r\ntime, especially in the East, as an attempt at confiscation, and the\r\nrailroad companies refused to obey it for several years; but ultimately\r\nit stood the test of the courts and became the permanent basis of\r\nrailroad regulation in Illinois and the model for the solution of this\r\nproblem in many other States.\r\n\r\nThe first Granger law of Minnesota, enacted in 1871, established fixed\r\nschedules for both passengers and freight, while another act of the same\r\nyear provided for a railroad commissioner. In this instance also the\r\ncompanies denied the validity of the law, and when the state supreme\r\ncourt upheld it in 1873, they appealed to the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States. In the meantime there was no way of enforcing the law,\r\nand the antagonism toward the roads fostered by the Grange and the\r\nAnti-Monopoly party became more and more intense. In 1874 the\r\nlegislature replaced the Act of 1871 with one modeled on the Illinois\r\nlaw of 1873; but it soon discovered that no workable set of uniform\r\nrates could be made for the State because of the wide variation of\r\nconditions in the different sections. Rates and fares which would be\r\njust to the companies in the frontier regions of the State would be\r\nextortionate in the thickly populated areas. This difficulty could have\r\nbeen avoided by giving the commission power to establish varying\r\nschedules for different sections of the same road; but the anti-railroad\r\nsentiment was beginning to die down, and the Legislature of 1875,\r\ninstead of trying to improve the law, abandoned the attempt at state\r\nregulation.\r\n\r\nThe Granger laws of Iowa and Wisconsin, both enacted in 1874, attempted\r\nto establish maximum rates by direct legislative action, although\r\ncommissions were also created to collect information and assist in\r\nenforcing the laws. The Iowa law was very carefully drawn and appears to\r\nhave been observed, in form at least, by most of the companies while it\r\nremained in force. In 1878, however, a systematic campaign on the part\r\nof the railroad forces resulted in the repeal of the act. In Wisconsin,\r\na majority of the members of the Senate favored the railroads and,\r\nfearing to show their hands, attempted to defeat the proposed\r\nlegislation by substituting the extremely radical Potter Bill for the\r\nmoderate measure adopted by the Assembly. The senators found themselves\r\nhoist with their own petard, however, for the lower house, made up\r\nlargely of Grangers, accepted this bill rather than let the matter of\r\nrailroad legislation go by default. The rates fixed by the Potter Law\r\nfor many commodities were certainly unreasonably low, although the\r\nassertion of a railroad official that the enforcement of the law would\r\ncut off twenty-five per cent of the gross earnings of the companies was\r\na decided exaggeration. Relying upon the advice of such eminent Eastern\r\nlawyers as William M. Evarts, Charles O'Conor, E. Rockwood Hoar, and\r\nBenjamin R. Curtis that the law was invalid, the roads refused to obey\r\nit until it was upheld by the state supreme court late in 1874. They\r\nthen began a campaign for its repeal. Though they obtained only some\r\nmodification in 1875, they succeeded completely in 1876.\r\n\r\nThe contest between the railroads and the farmers was intense while it\r\nlasted. The farmers had votes; the railroads had money; and the\r\nlegislators were sometimes between the devil and the deep sea in the\r\nfear of offending one side or the other. The farmers' methods of\r\ncampaign were simple. Often questionnaires were distributed to all\r\ncandidates for office, and only those who went on record as favoring\r\nrailroad restriction were endorsed by the farmers' clubs and committees.\r\nAn agricultural convention, sometimes even a meeting of the state\r\nGrange, would be held at the capital of the State while the legislature\r\nwas in session, and it was a bold legislator who, in the presence of his\r\nfarmer constituents, would vote against the measures they approved. When\r\nthe railroads in Illinois refused to lower their passenger rates to\r\nconform to the law, adventurous farmers often attempted to \"ride for\r\nlegal fares,\" giving the trainmen the alternative of accepting the low\r\nfares or throwing the hardy passengers from the train.\r\n\r\nThe methods of the railroads in dealing with the legislators were most\r\nsubtle. Whether or not the numerous charges of bribery were true,\r\nrailroad favors were undoubtedly distributed among well disposed\r\nlegislators. In Iowa passes were not given to the senators who voted\r\nagainst the railroads, and those sent to the men who voted in the\r\nrailroads' interest were accompanied by notes announcing that free\r\npasses were no longer to be given generally but only to the friends of\r\nthe railroads. At the session of the Iowa Legislature in 1872, four\r\nlawyers who posed as farmers and Grange members were well known as\r\nlobbyists for the railroads. The senate paid its respects to these men\r\nat the close of its session by adopting the following resolution:\r\n\r\nWhereas, There have been constantly in attendance on the Senate and\r\nHouse of this General Assembly, from the commencement of the session to\r\nthe present time, four gentlemen professing to represent the great\r\nagricultural interest of the State of Iowa, known as the Grange; and--\r\n\r\nWhereas, These gentlemen appear entirely destitute of any visible means\r\nof support; therefore be it--\r\n\r\nResolved, By the Senate, the House concurring, that the janitors permit\r\naforesaid gentlemen to gather up all the waste paper, old newspapers,\r\n&c., from under the desks of the members, and they be allowed one\r\npostage stamp each, The American Agriculturist, What Greeley Knows about\r\nFarming, and that they be permitted to take with them to their homes, if\r\nthey have any, all the rejected railroad tariff bills, Beardsley's\r\nspeech on female suffrage, Claussen's reply, Kasson's speech on\r\nbarnacles, Blakeley's dog bill, Teale's liquor bill, and be given a pass\r\nover the Des Moines Valley Railroad, with the earnest hope that they\r\nwill never return to Des Moines.\r\n\r\nOnce the Granger laws were enacted, the railroads either fought the laws\r\nin court or obeyed them in such a way as to make them appear most\r\nobnoxious to the people, or else they employed both tactics. The\r\nlawsuits, which began as soon as the laws had been passed, dragged on,\r\nin appeal after appeal, until finally they were settled in the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States. These suits were not so numerous as might be\r\nexpected, because in most of the States they had to be brought on the\r\ninitiative of the injured shipper, and many shippers feared to incur the\r\nanimosity of the railroad. A farmer was afraid that, if he angered the\r\nrailroad, misfortunes would befall him: his grain might be delivered to\r\nthe wrong elevators or left to stand and spoil in damp freight cars;\r\nthere might be no cars available for grain just when his shipment was\r\nready; and machinery destined for him might be delayed at a time when\r\nlack of it would mean the loss of his crops. The railroads for their\r\npart whenever they found an opportunity to make the new laws appear\r\nobnoxious in the eyes of the people, were not slow to seize it. That\r\nsection of the Illinois law of 1873 which prohibited unjust\r\ndiscrimination went into effect in July, but the maximum freight rates\r\nwere not fixed until January of 1874. As a result of this situation, the\r\nrailroads in July made all their freight rates uniform, according to the\r\nlaw, but accomplished this uniformity by raising the low rates instead\r\nof lowering the high. In Minnesota, similarly, the St. Paul and Pacific\r\nroad, in its zeal to establish uniform passenger rates, raised the fare\r\nbetween St. Paul and Minneapolis from three to five cents a mile, in\r\norder to make it conform to the rates elsewhere in the State. The St.\r\nPaul and Sioux City road declared that the Granger law made its\r\noperation unprofitable, and it so reduced its train service that the\r\npeople petitioned the commission to restore the former rate. In\r\nWisconsin, when the state supreme court affirmed the constitutionality\r\nof the radical Potter law, the railroads retaliated in some cases by\r\ncarrying out their threat to give the public \"Potter cars, Potter rails,\r\nand Potter time.\" As a result the public soon demanded the repeal of the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIn all the States but Illinois the Granger laws were repealed before\r\nthey had been given a fair trial. The commissions remained in existence,\r\nhowever, although with merely advisory functions; and they sometimes did\r\ngood service in the arbitration of disputes between shippers and\r\nrailroads. Interest in the railroad problem died down for the time, but\r\nevery one of the Granger States subsequently enacted for the regulation\r\nof railroad rates statutes which, although more scientific than the laws\r\nof the seventies, are the same in principle. The Granger laws thus paved\r\nthe way not only for future and more enduring legislation in these\r\nStates but also for similar legislation in most of the other States of\r\nthe Union and even for the national regulation of railroads through the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States was the theater for the final\r\nstage of this conflict between the railroads and the farmers. In\r\nOctober, 1876, decisions were handed down together in eight cases which\r\nhad been appealed from federal circuit and state courts in Illinois,\r\nWisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota, and which involved the validity of the\r\nGranger laws. The fundamental issue was the same in all these cases--the\r\nright of a State to regulate a business that is public in nature though\r\nprivately owned and managed.\r\n\r\nThe first of the \"Granger cases,\" as they were termed by Justice Field\r\nin a dissenting opinion, was not a railroad case primarily but grew out\r\nof warehouse legislation which the farmers of Illinois secured in 1871.\r\nThis act established maximum charges for grain storage and required all\r\nwarehousemen to publish their rates for each year during the first week\r\nin January and to refrain from increasing these rates during the year\r\nand from discriminating between customers. In an endeavor to enforce\r\nthis law the railroad and warehouse commission brought suit against Munn\r\nand Scott, a warehouse firm in Chicago, for failure to take out the\r\nlicense required by the act. The suit, known as Munn vs. Illinois,\r\nfinally came to the United States Supreme Court and was decided in favor\r\nof the State, two of the justices dissenting. ¹ The opinion of the court\r\nin this case, delivered by Chief Justice Waite, laid down the principles\r\nwhich were followed in the railroad cases. The attorneys for the\r\nwarehousemen had argued that the act in question, by assuming to limit\r\ncharges, amounted to a deprivation of property without due process of\r\nlaw and was thus repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution of the United States. But the court declared that it had\r\nlong been customary both in England and America to regulate by law any\r\nbusiness in which the public has an interest, such as ferries, common\r\ncarriers, bakers, or millers, and that the warehouse business in\r\nquestion was undoubtedly clothed with such a public interest. Further,\r\nit was asserted that this right to regulate implied the right to fix\r\nmaximum charges, and that what those charges should be was a legislative\r\nand not a judicial question.\r\n\r\n¹ 94 United States Reports, 113.\r\n\r\nIn deciding the railroad cases the courts applied the same general\r\nprinciples, the public nature of the railroad business having already\r\nbeen established by a decision in 1872. ¹ Another point was involved,\r\nhowever, because of the contention of the attorneys for the companies\r\nthat the railway charters were contracts and that the enforcement of the\r\nlaws would amount to an impairment of contracts, which was forbidden by\r\nthe Constitution. The court admitted that the charters were contracts\r\nbut denied that state regulation could be considered an impairment of\r\ncontracts unless the terms of the charter were specific. Moreover, it\r\nwas pointed out that contracts must be interpreted in the light of\r\nrights reserved to the State in its constitution and in the light of its\r\ngeneral laws of incorporation under which the charters were granted.\r\n\r\n¹ Olcott vs. The Supervisors, 16 Wallace, 678.\r\n\r\nThese court decisions established principles which even now are of vital\r\nconcern to business and politics. From that time to this no one has\r\ndenied the right of States to fix maximum charges for any business which\r\nis public in its nature or which has been clothed with a public\r\ninterest; nor has the inclusion of the railroad and warehouse businesses\r\nin that class been questioned. The opinion, however, that this right of\r\nthe States is unlimited, and therefore not subject to judicial review,\r\nhas been practically reversed. In 1890 the Supreme Court declared a\r\nMinnesota law invalid because it denied a judicial hearing as to the\r\nreasonableness of rates; ¹ and the courts now assume it to be their\r\nright and duty to determine whether or not rates fixed by legislation\r\nare so low as to amount to a deprivation of property without due process\r\nof law. In spite of this later limitation upon the power of the States,\r\nthe Granger decisions have furnished the legal basis for state\r\nregulation of railroads down to the present day. They are the most\r\nsignificant achievements of the anti-monopoly movement of the seventies.\r\n\r\n¹ 134 United States Reports, 418.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nThe Collapse of the Granger Movement\r\n\r\nThe first phase of the agrarian crusade, which centered around and took\r\nits distinctive name from the Grange, reached its highwater mark in\r\n1874. Early in the next year the tide began to ebb. The number of\r\nGranges decreased rapidly during the remainder of the decade, and of\r\nover twenty thousand in 1874 only about four thousand were alive in\r\n1880.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes contributed to this sudden decline. Any organization\r\nwhich grows so rapidly is prone to decay with equal rapidity; the slower\r\ngrowths are better rooted and are more likely to reach fruition. So with\r\nthe Grange. Many farmers had joined the order, attracted by its novelty\r\nand vogue; others joined the organization in the hope that it would\r\nprove a panacea for all the ills that agriculture is heir to and then\r\nleft it in disgust when they found its success neither immediate nor\r\nuniversal. Its methods of organization, too, while admirably adapted to\r\narousing enthusiasm and to securing new chapters quickly, did not make\r\nfor stability and permanence. The Grange deputy, as the organizer was\r\ntermed, did not do enough of what the salesman calls \"follow-up work.\"\r\nHe went into a town, persuaded an influential farmer to go about with\r\nhim in a house-to-house canvass, talked to the other farmers of the\r\nvicinity, stirred them up to interest and excitement, organized a\r\nGrange, and then left the town. If he happened to choose the right\r\nmaterial, the chapter became an active and flourishing organization; if\r\nhe did not choose wisely, it might drag along in a perfunctory existence\r\nor even lapse entirely. Then, too, the deputy's ignorance of local\r\nconditions sometimes led him to open the door to the farmers' enemies.\r\nThere can be little doubt that insidious harm was worked through the\r\nadmission into the Grange of men who were farmers only incidentally and\r\nwhose \"interest in agriculture\" was limited to making profits from the\r\nfarmer rather than from the farm. As D. Wyatt Aiken, deputy for the\r\nGrange in the Southern States and later member of the executive\r\ncommittee of the National Grange, shrewdly commented, \"Everybody wanted\r\nto join the Grange then; lawyers, to get clients; doctors, to get\r\ncustomers; Shylocks, to get their pound of flesh; and sharpers, to catch\r\nthe babes in the woods.\"\r\n\r\nNot only the members who managed thus to insinuate themselves into the\r\norder but also the legitimate members proved hard to control. With that\r\nhostility to concentrated authority which so often and so lamentably\r\nmanifests itself in a democratic body, the rank and file looked with\r\nsuspicion upon the few men who constituted the National Grange. The\r\naverage farmer was interested mainly in local issues, conditions, and\r\nproblems, and looked upon the National Grange not as a means of helping\r\nhim in local affairs, but as a combination of monopolists who had taken\r\nout a patent on the local grange and forced him to pay a royalty in\r\norder to enjoy its privileges. The demand for reduction in the power of\r\nthe National Grange led to frequent attempts to revise the constitution\r\nin the direction of decentralization; and the revisions were such as\r\nmerely to impair the power of the National Grange without satisfying the\r\ndiscontented members.\r\n\r\nOf all the causes of the rapid collapse of the Granger movement, the\r\nunfortunate experience which the farmers had in their attempts at\r\nbusiness coöperation was probably chief. Their hatred of the middleman\r\nand of the manufacturer was almost as intense as their hostility to the\r\nrailroad magnate; quite naturally, therefore, the farmers attempted to\r\nuse their new organizations as a means of eliminating the one and\r\ncontrolling the other. As in the parallel case of the railroads, the\r\nfarmers' animosity, though it was probably greater than the provocation\r\nwarranted, was not without grounds.\r\n\r\nThe middlemen--the commission merchants to whom the farmer sold his\r\nproduce and the retail dealers from whom he bought his supplies--did\r\nundoubtedly make use of their opportunities to drive hard bargains. The\r\ncommission merchant had such facilities for storage and such knowledge\r\nof market conditions that he frequently could take advantage of market\r\nfluctuations to increase his profits. The farmer who sold his produce at\r\na low price and then saw it disposed of as a much higher figure was\r\nnaturally enraged, but he could devise no adequate remedy. Attempts to\r\nregulate market conditions by creating an artificial shortage seldom met\r\nwith success. The slogan \"Hold your hogs\" was more effective as a\r\ncatchword than as an economic weapon. The retail dealers, no less than\r\nthe commission men, seemed to the farmer to be unjust in their dealings\r\nwith him. In the small agricultural communities there was practically no\r\ncompetition. Even where there were several merchants in one town these\r\ncould, and frequently did, combine to fix prices which the farmer had no \r\nalternative but to pay. What irked the farmer most in connection with\r\nthese \"extortions\" was that the middleman seemed to be a nonproducer, a\r\nparasite who lived by draining the agricultural classes of the wealth\r\nwhich they produced. Even those farmers who recognized the middleman as\r\na necessity had little conception of the intricacy and value of his\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nAgainst the manufacturer, too, the farmer had his grievances. He felt\r\nthat the system of patent rights for farm machinery resulted in unfair\r\nprices--for was not this same machinery shipped to Europe and there sold\r\nfor less than the retail price in the United States? Any one could see\r\nthat the manufacturer must have been making more than reasonable profit\r\non domestic sales. Moreover, there were at this time many abuses of\r\npatent rights. Patents about to expire were often extended through\r\npolitical influence or renewed by means of slight changes which were\r\nclaimed to be improvements. A more serious defect in the patent system\r\nwas that new patents were not thoroughly investigated, so that\r\noccasionally one was issued on an article which had long been in common\r\nuse. That a man should take out a patent for the manufacture of a\r\nsliding gate which farmers had for years crudely constructed for\r\nthemselves and should then collect royalty from those who were using the\r\ngates they had made, naturally enough aroused the wrath of his victims.\r\n\r\nIt was but natural, then, that the Granges should be drawn into all\r\nsorts of schemes to divert into the pockets of their members the streams\r\nof wealth which had previously flowed to the greedy middlemen. The\r\nmembers of the National Grange, thinking that these early schemes for\r\ncoöperation were premature, did not at first take them up and\r\nstandardize them but left them entirely in the hands of local, county,\r\nand state Granges. These thereupon proceeded to \"gang their ain gait\"\r\nthrough the unfamiliar paths of business operations and too frequently\r\nbrought up in a quagmire. \"This purchasing business,\" said Kelley in\r\n1867, \"commenced with buying jackasses; the prospects are that many will \r\nbe sold.\" But the Grangers went on with their plans for business\r\ncoöperation with ardor undampened by such forebodings. Sometimes a local\r\nGrange would make a bargain with a certain dealer of the vicinity,\r\nwhereby members were allowed special rates if they bought with cash and\r\ntraded only with that dealer. More often the local grange would\r\nestablish an agency, with either a paid or a voluntary agent who would\r\nforward the orders of the members in large lots to the manufacturers or\r\nwholesalers and would thus be able to purchase supplies for cash at\r\nterms considerably lower than the retail prices. Frequently, realizing\r\nthat they could get still more advantageous terms for larger orders, the\r\nGranges established a county agency which took over the work of several\r\nlocal agents. Sometimes the Patrons even embarked upon the more\r\nambitious enterprise of coöperative stores.\r\n\r\nThe most common type of coöperative store was that in which the capital\r\nwas provided by a stock company of Grange members and which sold goods\r\nto Patrons at very low prices. The profits, when there were any, were\r\ndivided among the stockholders in proportion to the amount of stock they\r\nheld, just as in any stock company. This type of store was rarely\r\nsuccessful for any length of time. The low prices at which it sold goods\r\nwere likely to involve it in competition with other merchants.\r\nFrequently these men would combine to lower their prices and, by a\r\nprocess familiar in the history of business competition, \"freeze out\"\r\nthe coöperative store, after which they might restore their prices to\r\nthe old levels. The farmers seldom had sufficient spirit to buy at the\r\ngrange store if they found better bargains elsewhere; so the store was\r\nassured of its clientèle only so long as it sold at the lowest possible\r\nprices. Farmers' agencies for the disposal of produce met with greater\r\nsuccess. Coöperative creameries and elevators in several States are said\r\nto have saved Grange members thousands of dollars. Sometimes the state\r\nGrange, instead of setting up in the business of selling produce, chose\r\ncertain firms as Grange agents and advised Patrons to sell through these\r\nfirms. Where the choice was wisely made, this system seems to have saved\r\nthe farmers about as much money without involving them in the risks of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nBy 1876 the members of the National Grange had begun to study the\r\nproblem of coöperation in retailing goods and had come to the conclusion\r\nthat the so-called \"Rochdale plan,\" a system worked out by an English\r\nassociation, was the most practicable for the coöperative store. The\r\nNational Grange therefore recommended this type of organization. The\r\nstock of these stores was sold only to Patrons, at five dollars a share\r\nand in limited amounts; thus the stores were owned by a large number of\r\nstockholders, all of whom had equal voice in the management of the\r\ncompany. The stores sold goods at ordinary rates, and then at the end of\r\nthe year, after paying a small dividend on the stock, divided their\r\nprofits among the purchasers, according to the amounts purchased. This\r\nplan eliminated the violent competition which occurred when a store\r\nattempted to sell goods at cost, and at the same time saved the\r\npurchaser quite as much. Unfortunately the Rochdale plan found little\r\nfavor among farmers in the Middle West because of their unfortunate\r\nexperience with other coöperative ventures. In the East and South,\r\nhowever, it was adopted more generally and met with sufficient success\r\nto testify to the wisdom of the National Grange in recommending it.\r\n\r\nIn its attitude toward manufacturing, the National Grange was less sane.\r\nNot content with the elimination of the middlemen, the farmers were\r\ndetermined to control the manufacture of their implements. With the\r\nsmall manufacturer they managed to deal fairly well, for they could\r\nusually find some one who would supply the Grange with implements at\r\nless than the retail price. In Iowa, where the state Grange early\r\nestablished an agency for coöperative buying, the agent managed to\r\npersuade a manufacturer of plows to give a discount to Grangers. As a\r\nresult, this manufacturer's plows are reported to have left the factory\r\nwith the paint scarcely dry, while his competitors, who had refused to\r\nmake special terms, had difficulty in disposing of their stock. But the\r\nmanufacturers of harvesters persistently refused to sell at wholesale\r\nrates. The Iowa Grange thereupon determined to do its own manufacturing\r\nand succeeded in buying a patent for a harvester which it could make and\r\nsell for about half what other harvesters cost. In 1874 some 250 of\r\nthese machines were manufactured, and the prospects looked bright.\r\n\r\nDeceived by the apparent success of grange manufacturing in Iowa,\r\nofficers of the order at once planned to embark in manufacturing on a\r\nlarge scale. The National Grange was rich in funds at this time; it had\r\nwithin a year received well over $250,000 in dispensation fees from\r\nseventeen thousand new Granges. Angered at what was felt to be the\r\ntyranny of monopoly, the officers of the National Grange decided to use\r\nthis capital in manufacturing agricultural implements which were to be\r\nsold to Patrons at very low prices. They went about the country buying\r\npatents for all sorts of farm implements, but not always making sure of\r\nthe worth of the machinery or the validity of the patents. In Kansas,\r\nIowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky, they planned\r\nfactories to make harvesters, plows, wagons, sewing-machines,\r\nthreshing-machines, and all sorts of farm implements. Then came the\r\ncrash. The Iowa harvester factory failed in 1875 and bankrupted the\r\nstate Grange. Other failures followed; suits for patent infringements\r\nwere brought against some of the factories; local Granges disbanded for\r\nfear they might be held responsible for the debts incurred; and in the\r\nNorthwest, where the activity had been the greatest, the order almost\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Grange had a mushroom growth, it nevertheless exerted a\r\nreal and enduring influence upon farmers both as individuals and as\r\nmembers of a class. Even the experiments in coöperation, disastrous\r\nthough they were in the end, were not without useful results. While they\r\nlasted they undoubtedly effected a considerable saving for the farmers.\r\nAs Grange agents or as stockholders in coöperative stores or Grange\r\nfactories, many farmers gained valuable business experience which helped\r\nto prevent them from being victimized thereafter. The farmers learned,\r\nmoreover, the wisdom of working through the accepted channels of\r\nbusiness. Those who had scoffed at the Rochdale plan of coöperation, in\r\nthe homely belief that any scheme made in America must necessarily be\r\nbetter than an English importation, came to see that self-confidence and\r\nindependence must be tempered by willingness to learn from the\r\nexperience of others. Most important of all, these experiments in\r\nbusiness taught the farmers that the middlemen and manufacturers\r\nperformed services essential to the agriculturalist and that the\r\nproduction and distribution of manufactured articles and the\r\ndistribution of crops are far more complex affairs than the farmers had\r\nimagined and perhaps worthy of more compensation than they had been\r\naccustomed to think just. On their side, the manufacturers and dealers\r\nlearned that the farmers were not entirely helpless and that to gain\r\ntheir goodwill by fair prices was on the whole wiser than to force them\r\ninto competition. Thus these ventures resulted in the development of a\r\nnew tolerance and a new respect between the two traditionally\r\nantagonistic classes.\r\n\r\nThe social and intellectual stimulus which the farmers received from the\r\nmovement was probably even more important than any direct political or\r\neconomic results. It is difficult for the present generation to form any\r\nconception of the dreariness and dullness of farm life half a century\r\nago. Especially in the West, where farms were large, opportunities for\r\nsocial intercourse were few, and weeks might pass without the farmer\r\nseeing any but his nearest neighbors. For his wife existence was even\r\nmore drear. She went to the market town less often than he and the\r\nroutine of her life on the farm kept her close to the farmhouse and\r\nprevented visits even to her neighbors' dwellings. The difficulty of\r\ngetting domestic servants made the work of the farmer's wife extremely\r\nlaborious; and at that time there were none of the modern conveniences\r\nwhich lighten work such as power churns, cream separators, and\r\nwashing-machines. Even more than the husband, the wife was likely to\r\ndegenerate into a drudge without the hope--and eventually without the\r\ndesire--of anything better. The church formed, to be sure, a means of\r\nsocial intercourse; but according to prevailing religious notions the\r\nchurchyard was not the place nor the Sabbath the time for that healthy\r\nbut unrestrained hilarity which is essential to the well-being of man.\r\n\r\nInto lives thus circumscribed the Grange came as a liberalizing and\r\nuplifting influence. Its admission of women into the order on the same\r\nterms as men made it a real community servant and gave both women and\r\nmen a new sense of the dignity of woman. More important perhaps than any\r\nchange in theories concerning womankind, it afforded an opportunity for\r\nmen and women to work and play together, apparently much to the\r\nsatisfaction and enjoyment of both sexes. Not only in Grange meetings,\r\nwhich came at least once a month and often more frequently, but also in\r\nGrange picnics and festivals the farmers and their wives and children\r\ncame together for joyous human intercourse. Such frequent meetings were\r\nbound to work a change of heart. Much of man's self-respect arises from\r\nthe esteem of others, and the desire to keep that esteem is certainly a\r\npowerful agent in social welfare. It was reported that in many\r\ncommunities the advent of the Grange created a marked improvement in the\r\ndress and manners of the members. Crabbed men came out of their shells\r\nand grew genial; disheartened women became cheerful; repressed children\r\ndelighted in the chance to play with other boys and girls of their own\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThe ritual of the Grange, inculcating lessons of orderliness, industry,\r\nthrift, and temperance, expressed the members' ideals in more dignified\r\nand pleasing language than they themselves could have invented. The\r\nsongs of the Grange gave an opportunity for the exercise of the musical\r\nsense of people not too critical of literary quality, when with\r\n\"spontaneous trills on every tongue,\" as one of the songs has it, the\r\nmembers varied the ritual with music.\r\n\r\nOne of the virtues especially enjoined on Grange members was charity.\r\nCeres, Pomona, and Flora, offices of the Grange to be filled only by\r\nwomen, were made to represent Faith, Hope, and Charity, respectively;\r\nand in the ceremony of dedicating the Grange hall these three stood\r\nalways beside the altar while the chaplain read the thirteenth chapter\r\nof First Corinthians. Not only in theory but in practice did the order\r\nproclaim its devotion to charitable work. It was not uncommon for\r\nmembers of a local Grange to foregather and harvest the crops for a sick\r\nbrother or help rebuild a house destroyed by fire or tornado. In times\r\nof drought or plague both state and national Granges were generous in\r\ndonations for the sufferers; in 1874, when the Mississippi River\r\noverflowed its banks in its lower reaches, money and supplies were sent\r\nto the farmers of Louisiana and Alabama; again in the same year relief\r\nwas sent to those Patrons who suffered from the grasshopper plague west\r\nof the Mississippi; and in 1876 money was sent to South Carolina to aid\r\nsufferers from a prolonged drought in that State. These charitable\r\ndeeds, endearing giver and receiver to each other, resulted in a better\r\nunderstanding and a greater tolerance between people of different parts\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the local Granges were forums in which the members\r\ntrained themselves in public speaking and parliamentary practice.\r\nPrograms were arranged, sometimes with the help of suggestions from\r\nofficers of the state Grange; and the discussion of a wide variety of\r\ntopics, mostly economic and usually concerned especially with the\r\ninterests of the farmer, could not help being stimulating, even if\r\nconclusions were sometimes reached which were at variance with orthodox\r\npolitical economy. The Grange was responsible, too, for a great increase\r\nin the number and circulation of agricultural journals. Many of these\r\npapers were recognized as official organs of the order and, by\r\npublishing news of the Granges and discussing the political and economic\r\nphases of the farmers' movement, they built up an extensive circulation.\r\nRural postmasters everywhere reported a great increase in their mails\r\nafter the establishment of a Grange in the vicinity. One said that after\r\nthe advent of the order there were thirty newspapers taken at his office\r\nwhere previously there had been but one. Papers for which members or\r\nlocal Granges subscribed were read, passed from hand to hand, and\r\nthoroughly discussed. This is good evidence that farmers were forming\r\nthe habit of reading. All the Granger laws might have been repealed; all\r\nthe schemes for coöperation might have come to naught; all the moral and\r\nreligious teachings of the Grange might have been left to the church;\r\nbut if the Granger movement had created nothing else than this desire to\r\nread, it would have been worth while. For after the farmer began to\r\nread, he was no longer like deadwood floating in the backwaters of the\r\ncurrent; he became more like a propelled vessel in midstream--sometimes,\r\nto be sure, driven into turbulent waters, sometimes tossed about by\r\nconflicting currents, but at least making progress.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe Greenback Interlude\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the causes of the collapse of the Granger\r\nmovement in 1875 and 1876, returning prosperity for the Western farmer\r\nwas certainly not one of them, for the general agricultural depression\r\nshowed no signs of lifting until nearly the end of the decade. During\r\nthe Granger period the farmer attempted to increase his narrow margin of\r\nprofit or to turn a deficit into a profit by decreasing the cost of\r\ntransportation and eliminating the middleman. Failing in this attempt,\r\nhe decided that the remedy for the situation was to be found in\r\nincreasing the prices for his products and checking the appreciation of\r\nhis debts by increasing the amount of money in circulation.\r\n\r\nThis demand for currency inflation was by no means new when it was taken\r\nup by the Western farmers. It had played a prominent part in American\r\nhistory from colonial days, especially in periods of depression and in\r\nthe less prosperous sections of the ever advancing frontier. During\r\nthe Civil War, inflation was actually accomplished through the issue of\r\nover $400,000,000 in legal-tender notes known as \"greenbacks.\" No\r\ndefinite time for the redemption of these notes was specified, and they\r\nquickly declined in value as compared with gold. At the close of the war\r\na paper dollar was worth only about half its face value in gold. An\r\nattempt was made to raise the relative value of the greenbacks and to\r\nprepare for the resumption of specie payments by retiring the paper\r\nmoney from circulation as rapidly as possible. This policy meant, of\r\ncourse, a contraction of the volume of currency and consequently met\r\nwith immediate opposition. In February, 1868, Congress prohibited the\r\nfurther retirement of greenbacks and left to the discretion of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury the reissue of the $44,000,000 which had been\r\nretired. Only small amounts were reissued, however, until after the\r\npanic of 1873; and when Congress attempted, in April, 1874, to force a\r\npermanent increase of the currency to $400,000,000, President Grant\r\nvetoed the bill.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the currency problem was that of the medium to be\r\nused in the payment of the principal of bonds issued during the Civil\r\nWar. When the bonds were sold, it was generally understood that they\r\nwould be redeemed in gold or its equivalent. Some of the issues,\r\nhowever, were covered by no specific declaration to that effect, and a\r\nconsiderable sentiment arose in favor of redeeming them with currency,\r\nor lawful money, as it was called.\r\n\r\nThese questions were not party issues at first, and there was no \r\nclear-cut division upon them between the two old parties throughout the\r\nperiod. The alinement was by class and section rather than by party; and\r\ninflationists and advocates of the redemption of the bonds in currency\r\nwere to be found not only among the rank and file but also among the\r\nleaders of both parties. The failure of either the Democrats or the\r\nRepublicans to take a decided stand on these questions resulted, as so\r\noften before, in the development of third parties which made them the\r\nmain planks in the new platform.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts at organized political activity in behalf of\r\ngreenbackism came not from the farmers of the West but from the laboring\r\nmen of the East, whose growing class consciousness resulted in the\r\norganization of the National Labor Union in 1868. Accompanying, if not\r\nresulting from the Government's policy of contraction, came a fall of\r\nprices and widespread unemployment. It is not strange, therefore, that\r\nthis body at once declared itself in favor of inflation. The plan\r\nproposed was what was known as the \"American System of Finance\": money\r\nwas to be issued only by the Government and in the form of legal-tender\r\npaper redeemable only with bonds bearing a low rate of interest, these\r\nbonds in turn to be convertible into greenbacks at the option of the\r\nholder. The National Labor Union recommended the nomination of\r\nworkingmen's candidates for offices and made arrangements for the\r\norganization of a National Labor party. This convened in Columbus in\r\nFebruary, 1872, adopted a Greenback platform, and nominated David Davis\r\nof Illinois as its candidate for the presidency. After the nomination of\r\nHorace Greeley by the Liberal Republicans, Davis declined this\r\nnomination, and the executive committee of his party then decided that\r\nit was too late to name another candidate.\r\n\r\nThis early period of inflation propaganda has been described as \"the\r\nsocial reform period, or the wage-earners' period of greenbackism, as\r\ndistinguished from the inflationist, or farmers' period that followed.\"\r\nThe primary objects of the labor reformers were, it appears, to lower\r\nthe rate of interest on money and to reduce taxation by the\r\ntransformation of the war debt into interconvertible bonds. The farmers,\r\non the other hand, were interested primarily in the expansion of the\r\ncurrency in the hope that this would result in higher prices for their\r\nproducts. It was not until the panic of 1873 had intensified the\r\nagricultural depression and the Granger movement had failed to relieve\r\nthe situation that the farmers of the West took hold of greenbackism and\r\nmade it a major political issue.\r\n\r\nThe independent parties of the Granger period, as a rule, were not in\r\nfavor of inflation. Their platforms in some cases demanded a speedy\r\nreturn to specie payment. In 1873 Ignatius Donnelly, in a pamphlet\r\nentitled Facts for the Granges, declared: \"There is too much paper\r\nmoney. The currency is diluted--watered--weakened.... We have no\r\ninterest in an inflated money market.... As we have to sell our wheat at\r\nthe world's price, it is our interest that everything we buy should be\r\nat the world's price. Specie payments would practically add eighteen\r\ncents to the price of every bushel of wheat we have to sell!\" In Indiana\r\nand Illinois, however, the independent parties were captured by the\r\nGreenbackers, and the Indiana party issued the call for the conference\r\nat Indianapolis in November, 1874, which led to the organization of the\r\nNational Greenback party.\r\n\r\nThis conference was attended by representatives from seven States and\r\nincluded several who had been prominent in the Labor Reform movement.\r\n\"The political Moses of the 'New Party,'\" according to the Chicago\r\nTribune, was James Buchanan of Indianapolis, a lawyer \"with an ability\r\nand shrewdness that compel respect, however much his theories may be\r\nridiculed and abused.\" He was also the editor of the Sun, a weekly paper\r\nwhich supported the farmers' movement. The platform committee of the\r\nconference reported in favor of \"a new political organization of the\r\npeople, by the people, and for the people, to restrain the aggressions\r\nof combined capital upon the rights and interests of the masses, to\r\nreduce taxation, correct abuses, and to purify all departments of the\r\nGovernment.\" The most important issue before the people was declared to\r\nbe \"the proper solution of the money question,\" meaning thereby the\r\nissue of greenbacks interconvertible with bonds. A national convention\r\nof the party was called to meet at Cleveland on March 11, 1875.\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland convention, attended by representatives of twelve States,\r\ncompleted the organization of the Independent party, as it was\r\nofficially named, and made arrangements for the nominating convention.\r\nThis was held at Indianapolis on May 17, 1876, with 240 delegates\r\nrepresenting eighteen States. Ignatius Donnelly, who had apparently\r\nchanged his mind on the currency question since 1873, was the temporary\r\npresident. The platform contained the usual endorsement of a circulating\r\nmedium composed of legal-tender notes interconvertible with bonds but\r\ngave first place to a demand for \"the immediate and unconditional repeal\r\nof the specie-resumption act.\" This measure, passed by Congress in\r\nJanuary, 1875, had fixed January 1, 1879, as the date when the\r\nGovernment would redeem greenbacks at their face value in coin. Although\r\nthe act made provision for the permanent retirement of only a part of\r\nthe greenbacks from circulation, the new party denounced it as a\r\n\"suicidal and destructive policy of contraction.\" Another plank in the\r\nplatform, and one of special interest in view of the later free silver\r\nagitation, was a protest against the sale of bonds for the purpose of\r\npurchasing silver to be substituted for the fractional currency of war\r\ntimes. This measure, it was asserted, \"although well calculated to\r\nenrich owners of silver mines ... will still further oppress, in\r\ntaxation, an already overburdened people.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a strong movement in the convention for the nomination of\r\nDavid Davis for the presidency, but this seems to have met with\r\nopposition from Eastern delegates who remembered his desertion of the\r\nNational Labor Reform party in 1872. Peter Cooper of New York was\r\nfinally selected as the candidate. He was a philanthropist rather than a\r\npolitician and was now eighty-five years old. Having made a large\r\nfortune as a pioneer in the manufacture of iron, he left his business\r\ncares to other members of his family and devoted himself to the\r\neducation and elevation of the working classes. His principal\r\ncontribution to this cause was the endowment of the famous Cooper Union\r\nin New York, where several thousand persons, mostly mechanics, attended\r\nclasses in a variety of technical and educational subjects and enjoyed\r\nthe privileges of a free library and reading room. When notified of his\r\nnomination, Cooper at first expressed the hope that one or both of the\r\nold parties might adopt such currency planks as would make the new\r\nmovement unnecessary. Later he accepted unconditionally but took no\r\nactive part in the campaign.\r\n\r\nThe Greenback movement at first made but slow progress in the various\r\nStates. In Indiana and Illinois the existing independent organizations\r\nbecame component parts of the new party, although in Illinois, at least,\r\nquite a number of the former leaders returned to the old parties. In the\r\nother Western States, however, the third parties of the Granger period\r\nhad gone to pieces or had been absorbed by means of fusion, and new\r\norganizations had to be created. In Indiana the Independent party\r\ndeveloped sufficient strength to scare the Republican leaders and to\r\ncause one of them to write to Hayes: \"A bloody-shirt campaign, with\r\nmoney, and Indiana is safe; a financial campaign and no money and we are\r\nbeaten.\"\r\n\r\nThe Independents do not appear to have made a very vigorous campaign in\r\n1876. The coffers of the party were as empty as the pockets of the\r\nfarmers who were soon to swell its ranks; and this made a campaign of\r\nthe usual sort impossible. One big meeting was held in Chicago in\r\nAugust, with Samuel F. Cary, the nominee for Vice-President, as the\r\nprincipal attraction; and this was followed by a torchlight procession.\r\nA number of papers published by men who were active in the movement,\r\nsuch as Buchanan's Indianapolis Star, Noonan's Industrial Age of\r\nChicago, and Donnelly's Anti-Monopolist of St. Paul, labored not without\r\navail to spread the gospel among their readers. The most effective means\r\nof propaganda, however, was probably the Greenback Club. At a conference\r\nin Detroit in August, 1875, \"the organization of Greenback Clubs in\r\nevery State in the Union\" was recommended, and the work was carried on\r\nunder the leadership of Marcus M. Pomeroy. \"Brick\" Pomeroy was a\r\njournalist, whose sobriquet resulted from a series of Brickdust Sketches\r\nof prominent Wisconsin men which he published in one of his papers. As\r\nthe editor of Brick Pomeroy's Democrat, a sensational paper published in\r\nNew York, he had gained considerable notoriety. In 1875, after the\r\nfailure of this enterprise he undertook to retrieve his broken fortunes\r\nby editing a Greenback paper in Chicago and by organizing Greenback\r\nclubs for which this paper served as an organ. Pomeroy also wrote and\r\ncirculated a series of tracts with such alluring titles as Hot Drops and\r\nMeat for Men. Several thousand clubs were organized in the Northwest\r\nduring the next few years, principally in the rural regions, and the\r\nsecrecy of their proceedings aroused the fear that they were advocating\r\ncommunism. The members of the clubs and their leaders constituted, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the more radical of the Greenbackers. They usually\r\nopposed fusion with the Democrats and often refused to follow the\r\nregular leaders of the party.\r\n\r\nIn the election the Greenback ticket polled only about eighty thousand\r\nvotes, or less than one per cent of the total. In spite of the activity\r\nof former members of the Labor Reform party in the movement,\r\nPennsylvania was the only Eastern State in which the new party made any\r\nconsiderable showing. In the West over 6000 votes were cast in each of\r\nthe five States--Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, and Kansas. The\r\nagrarian aspect of the movement was now uppermost, but the vote of\r\n17,000 polled in Illinois, though the largest of the group, was less\r\nthan a quarter of the votes cast by the state Independent Reform party\r\nin 1874 when railroad regulation had been the dominant issue. Clearly\r\nmany farmers were not yet convinced of the necessity of a Greenback\r\nparty. The only tangible achievement of the party in 1876 was the\r\nelection of a few members of the Illinois Legislature who held the\r\nbalance between the old parties and were instrumental in sending David\r\nDavis to the United States Senate. This vote, it is interesting to note,\r\nkept Davis from serving on the electoral commission and thus probably\r\nprevented Tilden from becoming President.\r\n\r\nBut the Greenback movement was to find fresh impetus in 1877, a year of\r\nexceptional unrest and discontent throughout the Union. The agricultural\r\ndepression was even greater than in preceding years, while the great\r\nrailroad strikes were evidence of the distress of the workingmen. This\r\nsituation was reflected in politics by the rapid growth of the Greenback\r\nparty and the reappearance of labor parties with Greenback planks. ¹\r\n\r\n¹ In state elections from Massachusetts to Kansas the Greenback and\r\nlabor candidates polled from 5 to 15 per cent of the total vote, and in\r\nmost cases the Greenback vote would probably have been much greater had\r\nnot one or the other, and in some cases both, of the old parties\r\nincorporated part of the Greenback demands in their platforms. In\r\nWisconsin, for example, there was little difference between Democrats\r\nand Greenbackers on the currency question, and even the Republicans in\r\ntheir platform leaned toward inflation, although the candidates declared\r\nagainst it. No general elections were held in 1877 in some of the States\r\nwhere the Greenback sentiment was most pronounced.\r\n\r\nIn the following year the new party had an excellent opportunity to\r\ndemonstrate its strength wherever it existed. In February, 1878, a\r\nconference was held at Toledo for the purpose of welding the various\r\npolitical organizations of workingmen and advocates of inflation into an\r\neffective weapon as a single united party. This conference, which was\r\nattended by several hundred delegates from twenty-eight States, adopted\r\n\"National\" as the name of the party, but it was usually known from this\r\ntime on as the Greenback Labor party. The Toledo platform, as the\r\nresolutions adopted by this conference came to be designated, first\r\ndenounced \"the limiting of the legal-tender quality of greenbacks, the\r\nchanging of currency-bonds into coin-bonds, the demonetization of the\r\nsilver dollar, the excepting of bonds from taxation, the contraction of\r\nthe circulating medium, the proposed forced resumption of specie\r\npayments, and the prodigal waste of the public lands.\" The resolutions\r\nwhich followed demanded the suppression of bank notes and the issue of\r\nall money by the Government, such money to be full legal-tender at its\r\nstamped value and to be provided in sufficient quantity to insure the\r\nfull employment of labor and to establish a rate of interest which would\r\nsecure to labor its just reward. Other planks called for the coinage of\r\nsilver on the same basis as that of gold, reservation of the public\r\nlands for actual settlers, legislative reduction of the hours of labor,\r\nestablishment of labor bureaus, abolition of the contract system of\r\nemploying prison labor, and suppression of Chinese immigration. It is\r\nclear that in this platform the interests of labor received full\r\nconsideration. Just before the conference adjourned it adopted two\r\nadditional resolutions. One of these, adopted in response to a telegram\r\nfrom General B. F. Butler, denounced the silver bill just passed by\r\nCongress because it had been so modified as to limit the amount of\r\nsilver to be coined. The other, which was offered by \"Brick\" Pomeroy,\r\ndeclared: \"We will not affiliate in any degree with any of the old\r\nparties, but in all cases and localities will organize anew ... and ...\r\nvote only for men who entirely abandon old party lines and\r\norganizations.\" This attempt to forestall fusion was to be of no avail,\r\nas the sequel will show, but Pomeroy and his followers in the Greenback\r\nclubs adhered throughout to their declaration.\r\n\r\nIn the elections of 1878, the high-water mark of the movement, about a\r\nmillion votes were cast for Greenback candidates. Approximately\r\ntwo-thirds of the strength of the party was in the Middle West and\r\none-third in the East. That the movement, even in the East, was largely\r\nagrarian, is indicated by the famous argument of Solon Chase, chairman\r\nof the party convention in Maine. \"Inflate the currency, and you raise\r\nthe price of my steers and at the same time pay the public debt.\" \"Them\r\nsteers\" gave Chase a prominent place in politics for half a decade. The\r\nmost important achievement of the movement at this time was the election\r\nto Congress of fifteen members who were classified as Nationals--six\r\nfrom the East, six from the Middle West, and three from the South. In\r\nmost cases these men secured their election through fusion or through\r\nthe failure of one of the old parties to make nominations.\r\n\r\nEasily first among the Greenbackers elected to Congress in 1878 was\r\nGeneral James B. Weaver of Iowa. When ten years of age, Weaver had been\r\ntaken by his parents to Iowa from Ohio, his native State. In 1854, he\r\ngraduated from a law school in Cincinnati, and for some years thereafter\r\npracticed his profession and edited a paper at Bloomfield in Davis\r\nCounty, Iowa. He enlisted in the army as a private in 1861, displayed\r\ngreat bravery at the battles of Donelson and Shiloh, and received rapid\r\npromotion to the rank of colonel. At the close of the war he received a\r\ncommission as brigadier general by brevet. Weaver ran his first tilt in\r\nstate politics in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the Republican\r\nnomination for lieutenant governor in 1865. Although an ardent advocate\r\nof prohibition and of state regulation of railroads, Weaver remained\r\nloyal to the Republican party during the Granger period and in 1875 was\r\na formidable candidate for the gubernatorial nomination. It is said that\r\na majority of the delegates to the convention had been instructed in his\r\nfavor, but the railroad and liquor interests succeeded in stampeding the\r\nconvention to Samuel J. Kirkwood, the popular war governor. In the\r\nfollowing year Weaver took part in the organization of the Independent\r\nor Greenback party in Iowa and accepted a position on its state\r\ncommittee. Though resentment at the treatment which he had received from\r\nthe Republicans may have influenced him to break the old ties, he was\r\ndoubtless sincerely convinced that the Republican party was beyond\r\nredemption and that the only hope for reform lay in the new party\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nWeaver was gifted with remarkable talent as an orator. His fine face and\r\nsoldierly bearing, his rich sympathetic voice and vivid imagination,\r\nmade him a favorite speaker at soldiers' reunions and in political\r\ncampaigns. Lacking the eccentricities of so many of his third party\r\nassociates and never inclined to go to extremes in his radicalism, he\r\nwas one of the ablest and, from the standpoint of the Republicans, the\r\nmost dangerous of the Greenback leaders. In Congress Weaver won the\r\nrespect of his colleagues. Always ready to promote what he believed to\r\nbe the interests of the common people and especially of the farmers, he\r\nespoused the cause of the Oklahoma \"boomers,\" who were opposed by a\r\npowerful lobby representing the interests of the \"cattle barons.\" He\r\ndeclared that, in a choice between bullocks and babies, he would stand\r\nfor babies, and he staged a successful filibuster at the close of a\r\nsession in order to force the consideration of a bill for the opening of\r\npart of Oklahoma to settlement.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries of the campaign of 1880 were vexed by dissension\r\nwithin the ranks of the Greenbackers. In March the radical faction led\r\nby Pomeroy held a convention in St. Louis which claimed to speak for ten\r\nthousand Greenback clubs and two million voters. After Stephen D.\r\nDillaye of New York had refused the presidential nomination at the hands\r\nof this convention, it adjourned to meet in Chicago on the 9th of\r\nJune--the place and time already selected for the regular convention of\r\nthe National party. One reason for the attitude of this faction appears\r\nto have been the fear of fusion with the Democrats. The Chicago\r\nconvention finally succeeded in absorbing these malcontents, as well as\r\na group of socialist delegates and representatives of various labor\r\norganizations who asked to be admitted. Dennis Kearney, the notorious\r\nsand-lot agitator of California was made chief sergeant at arms, and\r\nSusan B. Anthony was allowed to give a suffrage speech. The platform\r\ndiffered from earlier Greenback documents in that it contained no\r\ndenunciation of the Resumption Act. That was now a dead issue, for on\r\nJanuary 1, 1879, resumption became an accomplished fact, and the paper\r\ncurrency was worth its face value in gold. Apart from this the platform\r\nwas much the same as that adopted at Toledo in 1878, with the addition\r\nof planks favoring women's suffrage, a graduated income tax, and\r\ncongressional regulation of interstate commerce. On the first ballot,\r\nGeneral Weaver received a majority of the votes for presidential\r\nnominee; and B. J. Chambers of Texas was nominated for Vice-President.\r\n\r\nGeneral Weaver in his letter of acceptance declared it to be his\r\nintention \"to visit the various sections of the Union and talk to the\r\npeople.\" This he did, covering the country from Arkansas to Maine and\r\nfrom Lake Michigan to the Gulf, speaking in Faneuil Hall at Boston and\r\nin the Cooper Union at New York, but spending the greater part of his\r\ntime in the Southern States. He declared that he traveled twenty\r\nthousand miles, made fully one hundred speeches, shook the hands of\r\nthirty thousand people, and was heard by half a million. Weaver was the\r\nfirst presidential candidate to conduct a campaign of this sort, and the\r\nresults were not commensurate with his efforts. The Greenback vote was\r\nonly 308,578, about three per cent of the total. One explanation of the\r\nsmall vote would seem to be the usual disinclination of people to vote\r\nfor a man who has no chance of election, however much they may approve\r\nof him and his principles, when they have the opportunity to make their\r\nvotes count in deciding between two other candidates. Then, too, the sun\r\nof prosperity was beginning at last to dissipate the clouds of\r\ndepression. The crops of corn, wheat, and oats raised in 1880 were the\r\nlargest the country had ever known; and the price of corn for once\r\nfailed to decline as production rose, so that the crop was worth half as\r\nmuch again as that of 1878. When the farmer had large crops to dispose\r\nof at remunerative prices, he lost interest in the inflation of the\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nAfter 1880 the Greenback party rapidly disintegrated. There was no\r\nlonger any hope of its becoming a major party, in the near future at\r\nleast, and the more conservative leaders began to drift back into the\r\nold parties or to make plans for fusion with one of them in coming\r\nelections. But fusion could at best only defer the end. The\r\ncongressional election of 1882 clearly demonstrated that the party was\r\nmoribund. Ten of the Congressmen elected in 1880 had been classified as\r\nNationals; of these only one was reëlected in 1882, and no new names\r\nappear in the list. It is probable, however, that a number of\r\nCongressmen classified as Democrats owed their election in part to\r\nfusion between the Democratic and Greenback parties.\r\n\r\nThe last appearance of the Greenbackers in national politics was in the\r\npresidential election of 1884. In May of that year a convention of \"The\r\nAnti-Monopoly Organization of the United States,\" held in Chicago,\r\nadopted a platform voicing a demand for legislative control of\r\ncorporations and monopolies in the interests of the people and nominated\r\nGeneral Benjamin F. Butler for President. The convention of the\r\nGreenback or National party met in Indianapolis, and selected Butler as\r\nits candidate also. General Weaver presided over the convention. The\r\nplatform contained the usual demands of the party with the exception of\r\nthe resolution for the \"free and unlimited coinage of gold and silver,\"\r\nwhich was rejected by a vote of 218 to 164. It would appear that the\r\nmajority of the delegates preferred to rely upon legal-tender paper to\r\nfurnish the ample supply of money desired. General Butler was at this\r\ntime acting with the Democrats in Massachusetts, and his first response\r\nwas noncommittal. Although he subsequently accepted both nominations, he\r\ndid not make an active campaign, and his total popular vote was only\r\n175,370. Butler's personal popularity and his labor affiliations brought\r\nincreased votes in some of the Eastern States and in Michigan, but in\r\nthose Western States where the party had been strongest in 1880 and\r\nwhere it had been distinctly a farmers' movement there was a great\r\nfalling off in the Greenback vote.\r\n\r\nThough the forces of agrarian discontent attained national political\r\norganization for the first time in the Greenback party, its leaders were\r\nnever able to obtain the support of more than a minority of the farmers.\r\nThe habit of voting the Republican or the Democratic ticket, firmly\r\nestablished by the Civil War and by Reconstruction, was too strong to be\r\nlightly broken; and many who favored inflation could not yet bring\r\nthemselves to the point of supporting the Greenback party. On the other\r\nhand there were undoubtedly many farmers and others who felt that the\r\nold parties were hopelessly subservient to capitalistic interests, who\r\nwere ready to join in radical movements for reform and for the\r\nadvancement of the welfare of the industrial classes, but who were not\r\nconvinced that the structure of permanent prosperity for farmer and\r\nworkingman could be built on a foundation of fiat money. Although the\r\nplatforms of the Greenbackers contained many demands which were soundly\r\nprogressive, inflation was the paramount issue in them; and with this\r\nissue the party was unable to obtain the support of all the forces of\r\ndiscontent, radicalism, and reform which had been engendered by the\r\neconomic and political conditions of the times. The Greenback movement\r\nwas ephemeral. Failing to solve the problem of agricultural depression,\r\nit passed away as had the Granger movement before it; but the greater\r\nfarmers' movement of which both were a part went on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nThe Plight of the Farmer\r\n\r\nAn English observer of agricultural conditions in 1893 finds that\r\nagricultural unrest was not peculiar to the United States in the last\r\nquarter of the nineteenth century, but existed in all the more advanced\r\ncountries of the world:\r\n\r\nAlmost everywhere, certainly in England, France, Germany, Italy,\r\nScandinavia, and the United States, the agriculturists, formerly so\r\ninstinctively conservative, are becoming fiercely discontented, declare\r\nthey gained less by civilization than the rest of the community, and are\r\nlooking about for remedies of a drastic nature. In England they are\r\nhoping for aid from councils of all kinds; in France they have put on\r\nprotective duties which have been increased in vain twice over; in\r\nGermany they put on and relaxed similar duties and are screaming for\r\nthem again; in Scandinavia--Denmark more particularly--they limit the\r\naggregation of land; and in the United States they create organizations\r\nlike the Grangers, the Farmers' Leagues, and the Populists. ¹\r\n\r\n¹ The Spectator, vol. LXX, p. 247.\r\n\r\nIt is to general causes, indeed, that one must turn before trying to\r\nfind the local circumstances which aggravated the unrest in the United\r\nStates, or at least appeared to do so. The application of power--first\r\nsteam, then electricity--to machinery had not only vastly increased the\r\nproductivity of mankind but had stimulated invention to still wider\r\nactivity and lengthened the distance between man and that gaunt specter\r\nof famine which had dogged his footsteps from the beginning. With a\r\nconstantly growing supply of the things necessary for the maintenance of\r\nlife, population increased tremendously: England, which a few centuries\r\nbefore had been overcrowded with fewer than four million people, was now\r\nmore bountifully feeding and clothing forty millions. Perhaps, all in\r\nall, mankind was better off than it had ever been before; yet different\r\ngroups maintained unequal progress. The tillers of the soil as a whole\r\nremained more nearly in their primitive condition than did the dwellers\r\nof the city. The farmer, it is true, produced a greater yield of crops,\r\nwas surrounded by more comforts, and was able to enjoy greater leisure\r\nthan his kind had ever done before. The scythe and cradle had been\r\nsupplanted by the mower and reaper; horse harrows, cultivators, and\r\nrakes had transferred much of the physical exertion of farming to the\r\ndraft animals. But, after all, the farmer owed less to steam and\r\nelectricity than the craftsman and the artisan of the cities.\r\n\r\nThe American farmer, if he read the census reports, might learn that\r\nrural wealth had increased from nearly $4,000,000,000 in 1850 to not\r\nquite $16,000,000,000 in 1890; but he would also discover that in the\r\nsame period urban wealth had advanced from a little over $3,000,000,000\r\nto more than $49,000,000,000. Forty years before the capital of rural\r\ndistricts comprised more than half that of the whole country, now it\r\nformed only twenty-five per cent. The rural population had shown a\r\nsteady proportionate decrease: when the first census was taken in 1790,\r\nthe dwellers of the country numbered more than ten times those of the\r\ncity, but at the end of the nineteenth century they formed only about\r\none-third of the total. Of course the intelligent farmer might have\r\nobserved that food for the consumption of all could be produced by the\r\nwork of fewer hands, and vastly more bountifully as well, and so he\r\nmight have explained the relative decline of rural population and\r\nwealth; but when the average farmer saw his sons and his neighbors' sons\r\nmore and more inclined to seek work in town and leave the farm, he put\r\ntwo and two together and came to the conclusion that farming was in a\r\nperilous state. He heard the boy who had gone to the city boast that his\r\nhours were shorter, his toil less severe, and his return in money much\r\ngreater than had been the case on the farm; and he knew that this was\r\ntrue. Perhaps the farmer did not realize that he had some compensations:\r\ngreater security of position and a reasonable expectation that old age\r\nwould find him enjoying some sort of home, untroubled by the worry which\r\nmight attend the artisan or shopkeeper.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the American farmer realized that the nineteenth century\r\nhad seen a total change in the economic relations of the world, he did\r\nperceive clearly that something was wrong in his own case. The first and\r\nmost impressive evidence of this was to be found in the prices he\r\nreceived for what he had to sell. From 1883 to 1889 inclusive the\r\naverage price of wheat was seventy-three cents a bushel, of corn\r\nthirty-six cents, of oats twenty-eight cents. In 1890 crops were poor in\r\nmost of the grain areas, while prosperous times continued to keep the\r\nconsuming public of the manufacturing regions able to buy; consequently\r\ncorn and oats nearly doubled in price, and wheat advanced 20 per cent.\r\nNevertheless, such was the shortage, except in the case of corn, that\r\nthe total return was smaller than it had been for a year or two before.\r\nIn 1891 bumper crops of wheat, corn, oats, rye, and barley drove the\r\nprice down on all except wheat and rye, but not to the level of 1889.\r\nDespite a much smaller harvest in 1892 the decline continued, to the\r\nintense disgust of the farmers of Nebraska and Minnesota who failed to\r\nnote that the entire production of wheat in the world was normal in that\r\nyear, that considerable stores of the previous crop had been held over\r\nand that more than a third of the yield in the United States was sent\r\nforth to compete everywhere with the crops of Argentine, Russia, and the\r\nother grain producing countries. No wonder the average farmer of the\r\nMississippi basin was ready to give ear to any one who could suggest a\r\nremedy for his ills.\r\n\r\nCotton, which averaged nearly eleven cents a pound for the decade ending\r\nin 1890, dropped to less than nine cents in 1891 and to less than eight\r\nin 1892. Cattle, hogs, sheep, horses, and mules brought more in the late\r\nthan in the early eighties, yet these, too, showed a decline about 1890.\r\nThe abnormal war-time price of wool which was more than one dollar a\r\npound in October, 1864, dropped precipitately with peace, rose a little\r\njust before the panic of 1873, and then declined with almost no reaction\r\nuntil it reached thirty-three cents for the highest grade in 1892.\r\n\r\nThe \"roaring eighties,\" with all their superficial appearance of\r\nprosperity, had apparently not brought equal cheer to all. And then came\r\nthe \"heart-breaking nineties.\" In February, 1893, the Philadelphia and\r\nReading Railroad Company failed, a break in the stock market followed,\r\nand an old-fashioned panic seized the country in its grasp. A period of\r\nhitherto unparalleled speculative frenzy came thus to an end, and sober\r\nyears followed in which the American people had ample opportunity to\r\ncontemplate the evils arising from their economic debauch.\r\n\r\nPrices of agricultural products continued their downward trend. Wheat\r\ntouched bottom in 1894 with an average price of forty-nine cents; corn,\r\ntwo years later, reached twenty-one cents. All the other grains were\r\nlikewise affected. Middling cotton which had sold at eight and a half\r\ncents a pound in 1893, dropped below seven cents the following year,\r\nrecovered until it reached nearly eight cents in 1896, and was at its\r\nlowest in 1898 at just under six cents. Of all the marketable products\r\nof the farm, cattle, hay, and hogs alone maintained the price level of\r\nthe decade prior to 1892. Average prices, moreover, do not fully\r\nindicate the small return which many farmers received. In December,\r\n1891, for instance, the average value of a bushel of corn was about\r\nforty cents, but in Nebraska, on January 1, 1892, corn brought only\r\ntwenty-six cents. When, a few years later, corn was worth, according to\r\nthe statistics, just over twenty-one cents, it was literally cheaper to\r\nburn it in Kansas or Nebraska than to cart it to town, sell it, and buy\r\ncoal with the money received; and this is just what hundreds of\r\ndespairing farmers did. Even crop shortage did little to increase the\r\nprice of the grain that was raised. When a drought seriously diminished\r\nthe returns in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan in 1895, the importation from\r\nStates farther west prevented any rise in price.\r\n\r\nPrices dropped, but the interest on mortgages remained the same. One\r\nhundred and seventy-four bushels of wheat would pay the interest at 8\r\nper cent on a $2000 mortgage in 1888, when the price of wheat was higher\r\nthan it had been for ten years and higher than it was to be again for a\r\ndozen years. In 1894 or 1895 when the price was hovering around fifty\r\ncents, it took 320 bushels to pay the same interest. Frequently the\r\ninterest was higher than 8 per cent, and outrageous commissions on\r\nrenewals increased the burden of the farmer. The result was one\r\nforeclosure after another. The mortgage shark was identified as the\r\nservant of the \"Wall Street Octopus,\" and between them there was little\r\nhope for the farmer. In Kansas, according to a contemporary\r\ninvestigator, ¹ \"the whole western third of the State was settled by a\r\nboom in farm lands. Multitudes of settlers took claims without means of\r\ntheir own, expecting to pay for the land from the immediate profits of\r\nfarming. Multitudes of them mortgaged the land for improvements, and\r\nmultitudes more expended the proceeds of mortgages in living. When it\r\nwas found that the proceeds of farming in that part of the State were\r\nvery uncertain, at best, the mortgages became due. And in many instances\r\nthose who had been nominally owners remained upon the farms as tenants\r\nafter foreclosure. These are but the natural effects in reaction from a\r\ntremendous boom.\" In eastern Kansas, where settlement was older, the\r\npressure of hard times was withstood with less difficulty. It was in\r\nwestern Kansas, by the way, that Populism had its strongest following;\r\nand, after the election of 1892, a movement to separate the State into\r\ntwo commonwealths received serious consideration.\r\n\r\n¹ G. T. Fairchild, Pol. Sc. Q., vol. 11, p. 614.\r\n\r\nEven more inexorable than the holder of the mortgage or his agent was\r\nthe tax collector. It was easy to demonstrate that the farmer, with\r\nlittle or nothing but his land, his stock, and a meager outfit of\r\nimplements and furniture, all readily to be seen and assessed, paid\r\ntaxes higher in proportion to his ability to pay than did the business\r\nman or the corporation. Although his equity in the land he owned might\r\nbe much less than its assessed value, he was not allowed to make any\r\ndeduction for mortgages. The revenue of the Federal Government was\r\nraised wholly by indirect taxes levied principally upon articles of\r\ncommon consumption; and the farmer and other people of small means paid\r\nan undue share of the burden in the form of higher prices demanded for\r\ncommodities.\r\n\r\nLow prices for his produce, further depressed by the rapacity of the\r\nrailroads and the other intermediaries between the producer and the\r\nconsumer, mortgages with high interest rates, and an inequitable system\r\nof taxation formed the burden of the farmer's complaint during the last\r\ntwo decades of the nineteenth century. These grievances and all sorts of\r\nremedies proposed for them were discussed in farmers' gatherings, in\r\nagricultural weeklies, even in city dailies, and ultimately in\r\nlegislative chambers. Investigations demonstrated that, even when\r\nreduced to a minimum, the legitimate grounds for complaint were\r\nextensive; and the resultant reports suggested a variety of remedies.\r\nGenerally, however, popular sentiment swung around again to the tack it\r\nhad taken in the late seventies: the real cure for all the evils was\r\nmore money. Wall Street and the national banks could suck the blood from\r\nthe western community because of their monopoly of the money supply.\r\nAccording to one irate editor, \"Few people are aware of the boundless\r\nadvantages that the national banks have under our present accursed\r\nsystem. They have usurped the credit of the people and are fattening a\r\nthousand-fold annually from the unlimited resources at their command.\"\r\nAnother editor wrote:\r\n\r\nWe find the following printed card on our desk: \"The last report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury shows the banks as loaning $1,970,022,687\"!\r\nFour times the amount of money there is to loan. Four interests in every\r\ndollar! They are drawing from the people enough to run the National\r\nGovernment. How long will it take them to gather in all the money of the\r\nnation? This does not include the amounts loaned by state, private, and\r\nsavings banks. Add to this the billions of dollars of other loans and\r\nthink if it is any wonder times are hard. Will the American people never\r\nwake up to the fact that they are being pauperized? Four people are\r\npaying interest upon each dollar you have in your pocket--if you have\r\nany. Wake up! Wake up!\r\n\r\nWhatever the ultimate effects of an inflated and consequently\r\ndepreciated currency might be, the debtor class, to which a large\r\nportion of the Western farmers belonged, would obviously benefit\r\nimmediately by the injection of large quantities of money into the\r\ncirculating medium. The purchasing power of money would be lower; hence\r\nthe farmer would receive more in dollars and cents and would be in a\r\nbetter position to pay his standing debts. Whether or not the rise in\r\nthe prices of his products would be offset or more than offset by the\r\nincreased prices which he would have to pay for the things he purchased\r\nwould depend upon the relative rate at which different commodities\r\nadjusted themselves to the new scale of money value. In the end, of\r\ncourse, other things being equal, there would be a return of old\r\nconditions; but the farmers did not look so far ahead. Hence it was that\r\nless attention was paid to taxation, to railroad rates and\r\ndiscriminations, to elevator companies, to grain gamblers, or to\r\ncorporations as such; and the main force of the agrarian movements from\r\n1875 onward was exerted, first for an increased paper currency and then\r\nfor free silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nThe Farmer's Alliance\r\n\r\nThe hope of welding the farmers into an organization which would enable\r\nthem to present a united front to their enemies and to work together for\r\nthe promotion of their interests--social, economic, and political--was\r\ntoo alluring to be allowed to die out with the decline of the Patrons of\r\nHusbandry. Farmers who had experienced the benefits of the Grange, even\r\nthough they had deserted it in its hour of trial, were easily induced to\r\njoin another organization embodying all its essential features but\r\nproposing to avoid its mistakes. The conditions which brought about the\r\nrapid spread of the Grange in the seventies still prevailed; and as soon\r\nas the reaction from the Granger movement was spent, orders of farmers\r\nbegan to appear in various places and to spread rapidly throughout the\r\nSouth and West. This second movement for agricultural organization\r\ndiffered from the first in that it sprang from the soil, as it were,\r\nand, like Topsy, \"just growed\" instead of being deliberately planned and\r\nput into operation by a group of founders.\r\n\r\nA local farmers' club or alliance was organized in 1874 or 1875 in the\r\nfrontier county of Lampasas, Texas, for mutual protection against horse\r\nthieves and land sharks and for coöperation in the rounding up of\r\nstrayed stock and in the purchase of supplies. That it might accomplish\r\nits purposes more effectively, the club adopted a secret ritual of three\r\ndegrees; and it is said that at first this contained a formula for\r\ncatching horse thieves. Affiliated lodges were soon established in\r\nneighboring communities, and in 1878 a Grand State Alliance was\r\norganized. Some one connected with this movement must have been familiar\r\nwith the Grange, for the Declaration of Purposes adopted by the State\r\nAlliance in 1880 is but a crude paraphrase of the declaration adopted by\r\nthe earlier order at St. Louis in 1874. These promising beginnings were\r\nquickly wrecked by political dissension, particularly in connection with\r\nthe Greenback movement, and the first State Alliance held its last\r\nmeeting in 1879. In that year, however, a member of the order who\r\nremoved to Poolville in Parker County, Texas, organized there a\r\ndistinctly non-partisan alliance. From this new center the movement\r\nspread more rapidly; a second Grand State Alliance was organized; and\r\nthe order grew with such rapidity that by 1886 there were nearly three\r\nthousand local lodges in the State. The social aspect was prominent in\r\nthe Alliance movement in Texas from the beginning. Women were admitted\r\nto full membership, and negroes were excluded. In 1882 the three degrees\r\nof the ritual were combined into one so that all members might be on the\r\nsame footing.\r\n\r\nThe early minutes of the State Alliance indicate that the rounding up of\r\nestrays was the most important practical feature of the order at that\r\ntime, but in a few years this was overshadowed by coöperation. Trade\r\nagreements were made with dealers, joint stock stores and Alliance\r\ncotton-yards were established, and finally a state exchange was\r\norganized with a nominal capital of half a million dollars to handle the\r\nbusiness of the members. All the difficulties which the Grange had\r\nencountered in its attempts at coöperation beset the Alliance ventures:\r\ndissension was spread by merchants and commission men fighting for their\r\nlivelihood; mistakes were made by agents and directors; too much was\r\nattempted at once; and in a few years the house of cards tumbled to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWhile its business ventures were still promising, the Texas Alliance\r\ncame near being wrecked once more on the shoals of politics. The state\r\nmeeting in August, 1886, adopted an elaborate set of \"Demands,\" which\r\nincluded higher taxation of lands held for speculative purposes,\r\nprohibition of alien land ownership, laws to \"prevent the dealing in\r\nfutures of all agricultural products,\" full taxation of railroad\r\nproperty, \"the rapid extinguishment of the public debt of the United\r\nStates, by operating the mints to their fullest capacity in coining\r\nsilver and gold, and the tendering of the same without discrimination to \r\nthe public creditors,\" the issue of legal tender notes on a per capita\r\nbasis and their substitution for bank notes, a national bureau of labor\r\nstatistics, an interstate commerce law, and the abolition of the\r\ncontract system of employing convicts. Provision was made for a\r\ncommittee of three to press these demands upon Congress and the State\r\nLegislature. At the close of the meeting, some of the members, fearing\r\nthat the adoption of this report would lead to an attempt to establish a\r\nnew political party, held another meeting and organized a rival State\r\nAlliance.\r\n\r\nConsiderable confusion prevailed for a few months; the president and\r\nvice-president of the regular State Alliance resigned, and the whole\r\norder seemed on the verge of disruption. At this point there appeared on\r\nthe stage the man who was destined not only to save the Alliance in\r\nTexas but also to take the lead in making it a national organization--C.\r\nW. Macune, the chairman of the executive committee. Assuming the\r\nposition of acting president, Macune called a special session of the\r\nState Alliance to meet in January, 1887. At this meeting the\r\nconstitution was amended to include a declaration that it was the\r\npurpose of the order \"to labor for the education of the agricultural\r\nclasses in the science of economical government, in a strictly\r\nnonpartisan spirit\"; and attention was then directed to a plan for \"the\r\norganization of the cotton belt of America.\" The first step in this\r\ndirection was taken in the same month when the Texas Alliance joined\r\nwith the Farmers' Union of Louisiana and formed the National Farmers'\r\nAlliance and Coöperative Union of America. ¹\r\n\r\n¹ The Farmers' Union was the outgrowth of an open farmers' club\r\norganized in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana, in 1880. In 1885 this was\r\ntransformed into a secret society with a ritual modeled after that of\r\nthe Grange and with a constitution adapted from the constitution used by\r\nthe Texas alliances. Before the year was over the order spread into the\r\nadjoining parishes and a state union was established.\r\n\r\nMacune, who was elected president of the national body, at once sent\r\norganizers into most of the Southern States; and local alliances,\r\nfollowed rapidly by state organization, appeared in State after State.\r\nWhen the next meeting was held in October, 1887, delegates were present\r\nfrom nine Southern States. ¹ The \"Demands\" adopted at this meeting were\r\nvery like those which had split the Texas Alliance in the preceding\r\nyear, with the addition of sections calling for the reduction of the\r\ntariff to a revenue basis, a graduated income tax, promotion of\r\nindustrial and agricultural education, restriction of immigration, and\r\npopular election of United States senators.\r\n\r\n¹ By December, 1888, it was claimed that there were 10,000 alliances in\r\n16 States with a total membership of about 400,000. It was evident that\r\nthe organization of the farmers of the cotton belt was rapidly being\r\nconsummated.\r\n\r\nAs the Alliance spread into Arkansas and some of the adjoining States,\r\nit encountered another farmers' association of a very similar character\r\nand purpose. The Agricultural Wheel, as it was known, originated in a\r\nlocal club in Prairie County, Arkansas, in 1882, and soon expanded into\r\na state-wide organization. After amalgamating with another agricultural\r\norder, known as the Brothers of Freedom, the Wheel began to roll into\r\nthe adjoining States. In 1886 delegates from Tennessee and Kentucky\r\nattended the meeting of the Arkansas State Wheel and took part in the\r\norganization of the National Agricultural Wheel. ¹ When the National\r\nWheel held its first annual meeting in November, 1887, eight state\r\norganizations had been established, all in the Southwest, with a total\r\nmembership of half a million.\r\n\r\n¹ Some difficulty was occasioned at this meeting by the question of\r\nadmitting negroes to the order, but this was finally settled by making\r\nprovision for separate lodges for colored members.\r\n\r\nWith two great orders of farmers expanding in much the same territory\r\nand having practically identical objects, the desirability of union was\r\nobvious. The subject was discussed at meetings of both bodies, and\r\ncommittees of conference were appointed. Both organizations finally\r\nconvened in December, 1888, at Meridian, Mississippi, and appointed a\r\njoint committee to work out the details of amalgamation. The outcome was\r\na new constitution, which was accepted by each body acting separately\r\nand was finally ratified by the state organizations. The combined order\r\nwas to be known as the Farmers' and Laborers' Union of America.\r\n\r\nWhile this development had been going on in the South, another movement,\r\nsomewhat different in character and quite independent in origin, had\r\nbeen launched by the farmers of the Northwest. The founder of the\r\nNational Farmers' Alliance, or the Northwestern Alliance, as it was\r\ncalled to distinguish it from the Southern organization, was Milton\r\nGeorge, editor of the Western Rural of Chicago, who had been\r\ninstrumental in organizing a local alliance in Cook County. This\r\nAlliance began issuing charters to other locals, and in October, at the\r\nclose of a convention in Chicago attended by about \"five hundred,\r\nrepresenting alliances, granges, farmers' clubs, etc.,\" a national\r\norganization was formed. The constitution adopted at this time declared\r\nthe object of the order to be \"to unite the farmers of the United States\r\nfor their protection against class legislation, and the encroachments of\r\nconcentrated capital and the tyranny of monopoly; ... to oppose, in our\r\nrespective political parties, the election of any candidate to office,\r\nstate or national, who is not thoroughly in sympathy with the farmers'\r\ninterests; to demand that the existing political parties shall nominate\r\nfarmers, or those who are in sympathy with them, for all offices within\r\nthe gift of the people, and to do everything in a legitimate manner that\r\nmay serve to benefit the producer.\" The specific measures for which the\r\npromoters of the Northwestern Alliance intended to work were set forth\r\nin a platform adopted at the second annual meeting in Chicago, October\r\n5, 1881, which demanded: equal taxation of all property, including\r\ndeduction of the amount of mortgages from assessments of mortgaged\r\nproperty; \"a just income tax\"; reduction of salaries of officials and\r\ntheir election instead of appointment, so far as practicable; regulation\r\nof interstate commerce; reform of the patent laws; and prevention of the\r\nadulteration of food. \"The combination and consolidation of railroad\r\ncapital ... in the maintenance of an oppressive and tyrannical\r\ntransportation system\" was particularly denounced, and the farmers of\r\nthe country were called upon to organize \"for systematic and persistent\r\naction\" for \"the emancipation of the people from this terrible\r\noppression.\"\r\n\r\nThe Northwestern Alliance did not attempt coöperation in business so\r\nextensively as did its Southern contemporaries, but a number of Alliance\r\ngrain elevators were established in Minnesota and Dakota, coöperative\r\ncreameries flourished in Illinois, and many of the alliances appointed\r\nagents to handle produce and purchase supplies for the members. It was\r\nin the field of politics, however, that the activity of the order was\r\nmost notable. The methods by which the farmers of the Northwest\r\nattempted to use their organizations for political ends are well\r\nillustrated by the resolutions adopted at the annual meeting of the\r\nMinnesota State Alliance in 1886 which declared that \"the Alliance,\r\nwhile not a partisan association, is political in the sense that it\r\nseeks to correct the evils of misgovernment through the ballot-box,\" and\r\ncalled upon all the producers of the State \"to unite with us at the\r\nballot-box next November to secure a legislature that will work in the\r\ninterests of the many against the exactions of the few.\" The specific\r\ndemands included state regulation of railroads, free coinage of silver,\r\nreduction of the tariff to a revenue basis, revision of the patent laws,\r\nhigh taxation of oleomargarine, and reduction of the legal rate of\r\ninterest from 10 to 8 per cent. The secretary was directed to forward\r\ncopies of these resolutions to federal and state officers and to the\r\ndelegation of the State in Congress; and the members of local alliances\r\nwere \"urged to submit this platform of principles to every candidate for\r\nthe legislature in their respective districts, and to vote as a unit\r\nagainst every man who refuses to publicly subscribe his name to the same\r\nand pledge himself, if elected, to live up to it.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolutions adopted by the National Alliance in 1887 show that the\r\npolitical purposes of the order had become considerably more\r\ncomprehensive than they were when it was getting under way in 1881.\r\nFirst place was now given to a plank favoring the free coinage of silver\r\nand the issuance of \"all paper money direct to the people.\" The demand\r\nfor railroad regulation was accompanied by a statement that \"the\r\nultimate solution of the transportation problem may be found in the\r\nownership and operation by the Government of one or more\r\ntranscontinental lines\"; and the immediate acquisition of the Union\r\nPacific, then in financial difficulties, was suggested. Other\r\nresolutions called for government ownership and operation of the\r\ntelegraph, improvement of waterways, restriction of the liquor traffic,\r\nindustrial education in the public schools, restoration of agricultural\r\ncolleges \"to the high purpose of their creation,\" and popular election\r\nof Senators. The national body does not appear to have attempted, at\r\nthis time, to force its platform upon candidates for office; but it\r\nurged \"farmers throughout the country to aid in the work of immediate\r\norganization, that we may act in concert for our own and the common\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nThe culmination of this general movement for the organization of the\r\nfarmers of the country came in 1889 and 1890. The Farmers' and Laborers'\r\nUnion and the Northwestern Alliance met at St. Louis on December 3,\r\n1889. The meeting of the Southern organization, which was renamed the\r\nNational Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union, was attended by about a\r\nhundred delegates representing Indiana, Kansas, and every Southern State\r\nfrom Maryland to Texas, with the exception of West Virginia. The purpose\r\nof the two orders in holding their meetings at the same time and place\r\nwas obviously to effect some sort of union, and committees of conference\r\nwere at once appointed. Difficulties soon confronted these committees:\r\nthe Southern Alliance wanted to effect a complete merger but insisted\r\nupon retention of the secret features and the exclusion of negroes, at\r\nleast from the national body; the Northwestern Alliance preferred a\r\nfederation in which each organization might retain its identity.\r\nArrangements were finally made for future conferences to effect\r\nfederation but nothing came of them. The real obstacles seem to have\r\nbeen differences of policy with reference to political activity and a\r\nsurvival of sectional feeling.\r\n\r\nWith the failure of the movement for union, the Southern Alliance began\r\nactive work in the Northern States; and when the Supreme Council, as the\r\nnational body was now called, held its next meeting at Ocala, Florida,\r\nin December, 1890, delegates were present from state alliances of seven\r\nNorthern and Western States, in addition to those represented at the St.\r\nLouis meeting. The Farmers' Mutual Benefit Association, a secret order\r\nwith about two hundred thousand members, had a committee in attendance\r\nat this meeting, and the Colored Farmers' Alliance, which had been\r\nfounded in Texas in 1886 and claimed a membership of over a million,\r\nheld its national meeting at the same time and place. Plans were\r\nformulated for a federation of these three bodies, and of such other\r\nfarmers' and laborers' associations as might join with them, to the end\r\nthat all might work unitedly for legislation in the interests of the\r\nindustrial classes.\r\n\r\nSigns of approaching dissolution of the Alliance movement were already\r\napparent at the Ocala meeting. The finances of the Southern Alliance had\r\nbeen so badly managed that there was a deficit of about $6000 in the\r\ntreasury of the Supreme Council. This was due in part to reckless\r\nexpenditure and in part to difficulties in collecting dues from the\r\nstate organizations. Discord had arisen, moreover, from the political\r\ncampaign of 1890, and an investigating committee expressed its\r\ndisapproval of the actions of the officers in connection with a\r\nsenatorial contest in Georgia. The decline of the Southern Alliance\r\nafter 1890 was even more rapid than that of the Grange had been. The\r\nfailure of many of the coöperative ventures contributed to this decline;\r\nbut complications and dissensions resulting from the establishment of a\r\nnew political party which took over the Alliance platform, were\r\nprincipally responsible. The Northwestern Alliance continued for a few\r\nyears, practically as an adjunct to the new party but it, too, lost\r\nrapidly in membership and influence. With the year 1890 interest shifts\r\nfrom social to political organization, from Alliances to Populism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nThe People's Party Launched\r\n\r\nAlliances, wheels, leagues--all the agrarian organizations which\r\nmultiplied during the eighties--gave tangible form to the underlying\r\nunrest created by the economic conditions of that superficially\r\nprosperous decade. Only slowly, however, did there develop a feeling\r\nthat a new political party was necessary in order to apply the remedies\r\nwhich, it was believed, would cure some if not all the ills of the\r\nagricultural class. Old party ties were still strong. Only with\r\nreluctance could the Republican or Democrat of long standing bring\r\nhimself to depart from the familiar fold. Then, too, the recent\r\nignominious failures of the Greenback party might well cool the ardor of\r\nall but the most sanguine advocates of a third party movement. Among the\r\nleaders of the agrarian organizations were many, moreover, who foresaw\r\nthat to become involved in partisan politics could mean nothing less\r\nthan the defeat of all their original purposes.\r\n\r\nOne disappointment after another, however, made it apparent that little\r\nwas to be expected from the Republican or the Democratic party. Trust in\r\nindividual politicians proved equally vain, since promises easily made\r\nduring a hot campaign were as easily forgotten after the battle was\r\nover. One speaker before a state convention of the Northwest Alliance\r\nput into words what many were thinking: \"There may be some contingencies\r\nwhen you may have to act politically. If other parties will not nominate\r\nmen friendly to your interest, then your influence will have to be felt\r\nin some way or you may as well disband. If all parties nominate your\r\nenemies, then put some of your own friends into the race and then stand\r\nby them as a Christian stands by his religion.\" In other words, if\r\nnothing was to be gained by scattering votes among the candidates of the\r\nold parties, independent action remained the only course. Hence it was\r\nthat the late eighties saw the beginnings of another party of protest,\r\ndominated by the farmers and so formidable as to cause the machine\r\npoliticians to realize that a new force was abroad in the land.\r\n\r\nAfter the Greenback party lost the place it had for a fleeting moment\r\nobtained, labor once more essayed the rôle of a third party. In 1886,\r\nfor instance, the Knights of Labor and the trades unions, for once\r\ncoöperating harmoniously, joined forces locally with the moribund\r\nGreenbackers and with farmers' organizations and won notable successes\r\nat the polls in various parts of the Union, particularly in the Middle\r\nAtlantic and Western States. Emboldened by such victories, the\r\ndiscontented farmers were induced to cast in their lot with labor; and\r\nfor the next few years, the nation saw the manifestoes of a party which\r\ncombined the demands of labor and agriculture in platforms constructed\r\nnot unlike a crazy-quilt, with Henry George, James Buchanan, and Alson\r\nJ. Streeter presiding at the sewing-bee and attempting to fit into the\r\npatchwork the diverse and frequently clashing shades of opinion\r\nrepresented in the party. In 1888, Streeter, ex-president of the\r\nNorthwestern Alliance, was nominated for President on the Union Labor\r\nticket and received 146,935 votes in 27 of the 38 States. Despite its\r\nname and some support from the Eastern workers, the new party was\r\npredominantly Western: more than half of its total vote was polled in\r\nKansas, Texas, Missouri, and Arkansas. In the local elections of 1889\r\nand 1890 the party still appeared but was obviously passing off the\r\nstage to make way for a greater attraction.\r\n\r\nThe meager vote for Streeter in 1888 demonstrated that the organized\r\nfarmers were yet far from accepting the idea of separate political\r\naction. President Macune of the Southern Alliance probably voiced the\r\nsentiments of most of that order when he said in his address to the\r\ndelegates at Shreveport in 1887: \"Let the Alliance be a business\r\norganization for business purposes, and as such, necessarily secret, and\r\nas secret, necessarily nonpolitical.\" ¹ Even the Northwestern Alliance\r\nhad given no sign of official approval to the political party in which\r\nso many of its own members played a conspicuous part.\r\n\r\n¹ At the next annual meeting, in December, 1888, no change in policy was\r\nenunciated: the plan for a national organ, unanimously adopted by the\r\nAlliance, provided that it should be \"strictly non-partisan in politics\r\nand non-sectarian in religion.\"\r\n\r\nBut after the election of 1888, those who had continued to put their\r\ntrust in non-political organizations gradually awoke to the fact that\r\nneither fulminations against transportation abuses, monopolies, and the\r\nprotective tariff, nor the lobbying of the Southern Alliance in\r\nWashington had produced reforms. Even Macune was moved to say at the St.\r\nLouis session in December, 1889: \"We have reached a period in the\r\nhistory of our Government when confidence in our political leaders and\r\ngreat political organizations is almost destroyed, and estrangement\r\nbetween them and the people is becoming more manifest every day.\" Yet\r\nthe formation of a new party under the auspices of the Alliance was\r\nprobably not contemplated at this time, except possibly as a last\r\nresort, for the Alliance agreed to \"support for office only such men as\r\ncan be depended upon to enact these principles into statute laws,\r\nuninfluenced by party caucus.\" Although the demands framed at this St.\r\nLouis convention read like a party platform and, indeed, became the\r\nbasis of the platform of the People's Party in 1892, they were little\r\nmore than a restatement of earlier programs put forth by the Alliance\r\nand the Wheel. They called for the substitution of greenbacks for\r\nnational bank notes, laws to \"prevent the dealing in futures of all\r\nagricultural and mechanical productions,\" free and unlimited coinage of\r\nsilver, prohibition of alien ownership of land, reclamation from the\r\nrailroads of lands held by them in excess of actual needs, reduction and\r\nequalization of taxation, the issue of fractional paper currency for use\r\nin the mails, and, finally, government ownership and operation of the\r\nmeans of communication and transportation.\r\n\r\nThe real contribution which this meeting made to the agrarian movement\r\nwas contained in the report of the committee on the monetary system, of\r\nwhich C. W. Macune was chairman. This was the famous sub-treasury\r\nscheme, soon to become the paramount issue with the Alliance and the\r\nPopulists in the South and in some parts of the West. The committee\r\nproposed \"that the system of using certain banks as United States\r\ndepositories be abolished, and in place of said system, establish in\r\nevery county in each of the States that offers for sale during the one\r\nyear $500,000 worth of farm products--including wheat, corn, oats,\r\nbarley, rye, rice, tobacco, cotton, wool, and sugar, all together--a\r\nsub-treasury office.\" In connection with this office there were to be\r\nwarehouses or elevators in which the farmers might deposit their crops,\r\nreceiving a certificate of the deposit showing the amount and quality,\r\nand a loan of United States legal tender paper equal to eighty per cent\r\nof the local current value of the products deposited. The interest on\r\nthis loan was to be at the rate of one per cent per annum; and the\r\nfarmer, or the person to whom he might sell his certificate, was to be\r\nallowed one year in which to redeem the property; otherwise it would be\r\nsold at public auction for the satisfaction of the debt. This project\r\nwas expected to benefit the farmers in two ways: it would increase and\r\nmake flexible the volume of currency in circulation; and it would enable\r\nthem to hold their crops in anticipation of a rise in price.\r\n\r\nThe Northwestern Alliance also hesitated to play the rôle of a third\r\nparty, but it adopted a program which was virtually a party platform. In\r\nplace of the sub-treasury scheme as a means of increasing the volume of\r\ncurrency in circulation and at the same time enabling the farmer to\r\nborrow money at low rates of interest, this organization favored the\r\nestablishment of a land loan bureau operated by the Government. Legal\r\ntender currency to the amount of $100,000,000 or more if necessary, was\r\nto be placed at the disposal of this bureau for loans upon the security\r\nof agricultural land in amounts not to exceed one-half the value of the\r\nland and at an interest rate of two per cent per annum. These loans\r\nmight run for twenty years but were to be payable at any time at the\r\noption of the borrower.\r\n\r\nWith two strong organizations assuming all the functions of political\r\nparties, except the nomination of candidates, the stage was set in 1890\r\nfor a drama of unusual interest. One scene was laid in Washington, where\r\nin the House and Senate and in the lobbies the sub-treasury scheme was\r\naired and argued. Lending their strength to the men from the mining\r\nStates, the Alliance men aided the passage of the Silver Purchase Act,\r\nthe nearest approach to free silver which Congress could be induced to\r\nmake. By the familiar practice of \"logrolling,\" the silverites prevented\r\nthe passage of the McKinley tariff bill until the manufacturers of the\r\nEast were willing to yield in part their objections to silver\r\nlegislation. But both the tariff and the silver bill seemed to the angry\r\nfarmers of the West mere bones thrown to the dog under the table. They\r\nhad demanded free silver and had secured a mere increase in the amount\r\nto be purchased; they had called for a downward revision of the duties\r\nupon manufactured products and had been given more or less meaningless\r\n\"protection\" of their farm produce; they had insisted upon adequate\r\ncontrol of the trusts and had been presented with the Sherman Act, a law\r\nwhich might or might not curb the monopolies under which they believed\r\nthemselves crushed. All the unrest which had been gathering during the\r\nprevious decade, all the venom which had been distilled by fourteen cent\r\ncorn and ten per cent interest, all the blind striving to frustrate the\r\nindustrial consolidation which the farmer did not understand but feared\r\nand hated, found expression in the political campaign of 1890.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance suited its political activities to local necessities. In\r\nmany of the Southern States, notably Florida, Georgia, and the\r\nCarolinas, Alliance men took possession of the Democratic conventions\r\nand forced both the incorporation of their demands into the platforms\r\nand the nomination of candidates who agreed to support those demands.\r\nThe result was the control of the legislatures of five Southern States\r\nby members or supporters of the order and the election of three\r\ngovernors, one United States Senator, and forty-four Congressmen who\r\nchampioned the principles of the Alliance. In the West the Alliance\r\nworked by itself and, instead of dominating an old party, created a new\r\none. It is true that the order did not formally become a political\r\nparty; but its officers took the lead in organizing People's,\r\nIndependent, or Industrial parties in the different States, the\r\nmembership of which was nearly identical with that of the Alliance. Nor\r\nwas the farmer alone in his efforts. Throughout the whole country the\r\nprices of manufactured articles had suddenly risen, and popular opinion,\r\nfastening upon the McKinley tariff as the cause, manifested itself in a\r\nwidespread desire to punish the Republican party.\r\n\r\nThe events of 1890 constituted not only a political revolt but a social\r\nupheaval in the West. Nowhere was the overturn more complete than in\r\nKansas. If the West in general was uneasy, Kansas was in the throes of a\r\nmighty convulsion; it was swept as by the combination of a tornado and a\r\nprairie fire. As a sympathetic commentator of later days puts it, \"It\r\nwas a religious revival, a crusade, a pentecost of politics in which a\r\ntongue of flame sat upon every man, and each spake as the spirit gave\r\nhim utterance.\" ¹ All over the State, meetings were held in\r\nschoolhouses, churches, and public halls. Alliance picnics were all-day\r\nexpositions of the doctrines of the People's Party. Up and down the\r\nState, and from Kansas City to Sharon Springs, Mary Elizabeth Lease,\r\n\"Sockless\" Jerry Simpson, Anna L. Diggs, William A. Peffer, Cyrus\r\nCorning, and twice a score more, were in constant demand for lectures,\r\nwhile lesser lights illumined the dark places when the stars of the\r\nfirst magnitude were scintillating elsewhere.\r\n\r\n¹ Elizabeth N. Barr, The Populist Uprising, in William E. Connelly's\r\nStandard History of Kansas and Kansans, vol. II, p. 1148.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lease, who is reported to have made 160 speeches in the summer and\r\nautumn of 1890, was a curiosity in American politics. Of Irish birth and\r\nNew York upbringing, she went to Kansas and, before she was twenty years\r\nold, married Charles L. Lease. Twelve years later she was admitted to\r\nthe bar. At the time of the campaign of 1890 she was a tall,\r\nmannish-looking, but not unattractive woman of thirty-seven years, the\r\nmother of four children. She was characterized by her friends as\r\nrefined, magnetic, and witty; by her enemies of the Republican party as\r\na hard, unlovely shrew. The hostile press made the most of popular\r\nprejudice against a woman stump speaker and attempted by ridicule and\r\ninvective to drive her from the stage. But Mrs. Lease continued to talk.\r\nShe it was who told the Kansas farmers that what they needed was to\r\n\"raise less corn and more hell!\"\r\n\r\nWall Street owns the country [she proclaimed]. It is no longer a\r\ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people, but a\r\ngovernment of Wall Street, by Wall Street, and for Wall Street.... Money\r\nrules, and our Vice-President is a London banker. Our laws are the\r\noutput of a system that clothes rascals in robes and honesty in rags.\r\nThe parties lie to us, and the political speakers mislead us. We were\r\ntold two years ago to go to work and raise a big crop and that was all\r\nwe needed. We went to work and plowed and planted; the rains fell, the\r\nsun shone, nature smiled, and we raised the big crop that they told us\r\nto; and what came of it? Eight-cent corn, ten-cent oats, two-cent beef,\r\nand no price at all for butter and eggs--that's what came of it.... The\r\nmain question is the money question.... We want money, land, and\r\ntransportation. We want the abolition of the National Banks, and we want\r\nthe power to make loans directly from the Government. We want the\r\naccursed foreclosure system wiped out. Land equal to a tract 30 miles\r\nwide and 90 miles long has been foreclosed and bought in by loan\r\ncompanies of Kansas in a year.... The people are at bay, and the\r\nblood-hounds of money who have dogged us thus far beware!\r\n\r\nA typical feature of this campaign in Kansas was the contest between\r\nJerry Simpson and Colonel James R. Hallowell for a seat in Congress.\r\nSimpson nicknamed his fastidious opponent \"Prince Hal\" and pointed to\r\nhis silk stockings as an evidence of aristocracy. Young Victor Murdock,\r\nthen a cub reporter, promptly wrote a story to the effect that Simpson\r\nhimself wore no socks at all. \"Sockless Jerry,\" \"Sockless Simpson,\" and\r\nthen \"Sockless Socrates\" were sobriquets then and thereafter applied to\r\nthe stalwart Populist. Simpson was at this time forty-eight years old, a\r\nman with a long, square-jawed face, his skin tanned by exposure on\r\nshipboard, in the army, and on the farm, and his mustache cut in a\r\nstraight line over a large straight mouth. He wore clerical eyeglasses\r\nand unclerical clothes. His opponents called him clownish; his friends\r\ndeclared him Lincolnesque. Failing to make headway against him by\r\nridicule, the Republicans arranged a series of joint debates between the\r\ncandidates; but the audience at the first meeting was so obviously\r\npartial to Simpson that Hallowell refused to meet him again. The\r\nsupporters of the \"sockless\" statesman, though less influential and less\r\nprosperous than those of Hallowell, proved more numerous and\r\ntriumphantly elected him to Congress. In Washington he acquitted himself\r\ncreditably and was perhaps disappointingly conventional in speech and\r\nattire.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this misery, disgust, anger, and hatred on the part of\r\nthe people of Kansas focused by shrewd common sense and rank demagogism,\r\nwas the election of five Populist Congressmen and a large Populist\r\nmajority in the lower house of the state legislature; the Republican\r\nstate officers were elected by greatly reduced majorities. In Nebraska,\r\nthe People's Independent party obtained a majority of the members of the\r\nlegislature and reduced the Republican party to third place in the vote\r\nfor governor, the victory going to the Democrats by a very small\r\nplurality. The South Dakota Independent party, with the president of the\r\nstate Alliance as its standard bearer, was unable to defeat the\r\nRepublican candidates for state offices but obtained the balance of\r\npower in the legislature. In Indiana, Michigan, and Minnesota, the new\r\nparty movement manifested considerable strength, but, with the exception\r\nof one Alliance Congressman from Minnesota and a number of legislators,\r\nthe fruits of its activity were gathered by the Democrats.\r\n\r\nAmong the results of the new party movements in the Western States in\r\n1890 should be included the election of two United States Senators,\r\nneither of whom was a farmer, although both were ardent advocates of the\r\nfarmers' cause. In South Dakota, where no one of the three parties had a\r\nmajority in the legislature, the Reverend James H. Kyle, the Independent\r\ncandidate, was elected to the United State Senate, when, after\r\nthirty-nine ballots, the Democrats gave him their votes. Kyle, who was\r\nonly thirty-seven years old at this time, was a Congregational minister,\r\na graduate of Oberlin College and of Alleghany Theological Seminary. He\r\nhad held pastorates in Colorado and South Dakota, and at the time of his\r\nelection was financial agent for Yankton College. A radical Fourth of\r\nJuly oration which he delivered at Aberdeen brought him into favor with\r\nthe Alliance, and he was elected to the state senate on the Independent\r\nticket in 1890. Prior to this election Kyle had been a Republican.\r\n\r\nThe other senatorial victory was gained in Kansas, where the choice fell\r\non William A. Peffer, whose long whiskers made him a favorite object of\r\nridicule and caricature in Eastern papers. He was born in Pennsylvania\r\nin 1831, and as a young man had gone to California during the gold boom.\r\nReturning after two years with a considerable sum of money, he engaged\r\nin farming first in Indiana and then in Missouri. When the Civil War\r\nbegan, his avowed Unionist sentiments got him into trouble; and in 1862\r\nhe moved to Illinois, where after a few months he enlisted in the army.\r\nAt the close of the war he settled in Tennessee and began the practice\r\nof law, which he had been studying at intervals for a number of years.\r\nHe removed in 1870 to Kansas, where he played some part in politics as a\r\nRepublican, was elected to the state senate, and served as a delegate to\r\nthe national convention of 1880. After a number of newspaper ventures he\r\nbecame the editor of the Kansas Farmer of Topeka in 1880 and continued\r\nin that position until he was elected to the United States Senate. He\r\nwas a member of the Knights of Labor and was an ardent prohibitionist\r\nand, above all, an advocate of currency inflation.\r\n\r\nAfter the elections of November, 1890, came definite action in the\r\ndirection of forming a new national party. The Citizens' Alliance, a\r\nsecret political organization of members of the Southern Alliance, held\r\na convention with the Knights of Labor at Cincinnati on May 19, 1891. By\r\nthat time the tide of sentiment in favor of a new party was running\r\nstrong. Some fourteen hundred delegates, a majority of whom were from\r\nthe five States of Ohio, Kansas, Indiana, Illinois, and Nebraska,\r\nattended the convention and provided for a committee to make\r\narrangements, in conjunction with other reform organizations if\r\npossible, for a convention of the party to nominate candidates for the\r\npresidential election of 1892. To those who were anxious to have\r\nsomething done immediately the process of preparing the ground for a new\r\nthird party seemed long and laborious. Seen in its proper perspective\r\nthe movement now appears to have been as swift as it was inevitable.\r\nOnce more, and with greater unanimity than ever before, the farmers,\r\nespecially in the West, threw aside their old party allegiance to fight\r\nfor the things which they deemed not only essential to their own welfare\r\nbut beneficial to the whole country. Some aid, it is true, was brought\r\nby labor, some by the mining communities of the mountain region, some by\r\nvarious reform organizations; but the movement as a whole was distinctly\r\nand essentially agrarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nThe Populist Bombshell of 1892\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Populists as a full-fledged party in the domain of\r\nnational politics took place at Omaha in July, 1892. Nearly thirteen\r\nhundred delegates from all parts of the Union flocked to the convention\r\nto take part in the selection of candidates for President and\r\nVice-President and to adopt a platform for the new party. The \"Demands\"\r\nof the Alliances supplied the material from which was constructed a\r\nplatform characterized by one unsympathetic observer as \"that furious\r\nand hysterical arraignment of the present times, that incoherent\r\nintermingling of Jeremiah and Bellamy.\" The document opened with a\r\ngeneral condemnation of national conditions and a bitter denunciation of\r\nthe old parties for permitting \"the existing dreadful conditions to\r\ndevelop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them.\" Then\r\nfollowed three declarations: \"that the union of the labor forces of the\r\nUnited States this day consummated shall be permanent and perpetual\";\r\nthat \"wealth belongs to him who creates it, and every dollar taken from\r\nindustry without an equivalent is robbery\"; and \"that the time has come\r\nwhen the railroad corporations will either own the people or the people\r\nmust own the railroads.\" Next came the demands. Heading these were the\r\nmonetary planks: \"a national currency, safe, sound, and flexible, issued\r\nby the general Government only, a full legal tender for all debts,\" with\r\nthe sub-treasury system of loans \"or a better system; free and unlimited\r\ncoinage of silver and gold at the present legal ratio of sixteen to\r\none\"; and an increase in the circulating medium until there should be\r\nnot less than $50 per capita. With demands for a graduated income tax,\r\nfor honesty and economy in governmental expenditures, and for postal\r\nsavings banks, the financial part of the platform was complete. The\r\nusual plank declaring for government ownership and control of railroads\r\nand telegraphs now included the telephone systems as well, and the land\r\nplank opposed alien ownership and demanded the return of lands held by\r\ncorporations in excess of their actual needs. Other resolutions, adopted\r\nbut not included in the platform, expressed sympathy with labor's\r\ndemands for shorter hours, condemned the use of Pinkerton detectives in\r\nlabor strife, and favored greater restriction of immigration, the\r\ninitiative and referendum, direct election of United States senators,\r\nand one term for the President and Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThe platform, according to a news dispatch of the time, was \"received\r\nwith tremendous enthusiasm ... and was read and adopted almost before\r\nthe people knew it was read. Instantly there was enacted the mightiest\r\nscene ever witnessed by the human race. Fifteen thousand people yelled,\r\nshrieked, threw papers, hats, fans, and parasols, gathered up banners,\r\nmounted shoulders. Mrs. Lease's little girl was mounted on Dr. Fish's\r\nshoulders--he on a table on the high platform. The two bands were\r\nswamped with noise.... Five minutes passed, ten minutes, twenty, still\r\nthe noise and hurrahs poured from hoarse throats.\" After forty minutes\r\nthe demonstration died out and the convention was ready to proceed with\r\nthe nomination of a presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nNo such unanimity marked this further procedure, however. Just before\r\nthe convention the leaders of the People's Party had thrown the old\r\nparties into consternation by announcing that Judge Walter Q. Gresham,\r\nof Indiana, would be offered the nomination. Judge Gresham, a Republican\r\nwith a long and honorable public record, had been urged upon the\r\nRepublican party in 1884 and 1888, and \"Anti-Monopolists\" had considered\r\nhim with favor on account of his opinions and decisions regarding the\r\noperation and control of railroads. Just after the adoption of the\r\nplatform a telegram from the judge announced that he would accept a\r\nunanimous nomination. Since unanimity was unobtainable, however, his\r\nname was withdrawn later in the day.\r\n\r\nThis left the field to General James B. Weaver of Iowa and Senator James\r\nH. Kyle of South Dakota. Weaver represented the more conservative of the\r\nPopulists, the old Alliance men. His rival had the support of the most\r\nradical element as well as that of the silver men from the mountain\r\nStates. The silverites were not inclined to insist upon their man,\r\nhowever, declaring that, if the platform contained the silver plank,\r\nthey would carry their States for whatever candidate might be chosen.\r\nThe old campaigner proved the stronger, and he was nominated with\r\nGeneral James G. Field of Virginia for Vice-President. Unprejudiced\r\nobservers viewed Weaver's nomination as a tactical error on the part of\r\nthe Populist leaders: \"Mr. Weaver has belonged to the group of\r\nthird-party 'come-outers' for so many years that his name is not one to\r\nconjure with in either of the old camps; ... his name suggests too\r\nstrongly the abortive third-party movements of the past to excite much\r\nhope or enthusiasm. He is not exactly the sort of a Moses who can\r\nfrighten Pharaoh into fits or bring convincing plagues upon the\r\nmonopolistic oppressors of Israel. The wicked politicians of the\r\nRepublican and Democratic parties breathed easier and ate with better\r\nappetites when the Gresham bogie disappeared and they found their\r\nfamiliar old enemy, General Weaver, in the lead of the People's\r\nmovement.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be suspected, however, that even with Weaver at its head this\r\nparty, which claimed to control from two to three million votes, and\r\nwhich expected to draw heavily from the discontented ranks of the\r\nold-line organizations, was not viewed with absolute equanimity by the\r\ncampaign managers of Cleveland and of Harrison. Some little evidence of\r\nthe perturbation appeared in the equivocal attitude of both the old\r\nparties with respect to the silver question. Said the Democratic\r\nplatform: \"We hold to the use of both gold and silver as the standard\r\nmoney of the country, and to the coinage of both gold and silver without\r\ndiscrimination against either metal or charge for mintage.\" The rival\r\nRepublican platform declared that \"the American people, from tradition\r\nand interest, favor bimetallism, and the Republican party demands the\r\nuse of both gold and silver as standard money.\" Each party declared for\r\nsteps to obtain an international agreement on the question. The\r\nRepublicans attempted to throw a sop to the labor vote by favoring\r\nrestriction of immigration and laws for the protection of employees in\r\ndangerous occupations, and to the farmer by pronouncements against\r\ntrusts, for extended postal service--particularly in rural\r\ndistricts--and for the reclamation and sale of arid lands to settlers.\r\nThe Democrats went even further and demanded the return of \"nearly one\r\nhundred million acres of valuable land\" then held by \"corporations and\r\nsyndicates, alien and domestic.\"\r\n\r\nThe directors of the Populist campaign proved to be no mean political\r\nstrategists. General Weaver himself toured the country, accompanied by\r\nGeneral Field when he was in the South and by Mrs. Lease when he went to\r\nthe Pacific coast. Numerous other men and women addressed the thousands\r\nwho attended the meetings, great and small, all over the country. One\r\nunique feature of the Populist campaign on the Pacific coast was the\r\nsinging of James G. Clark's People's Battle-Hymn, and other songs\r\nexpressing the hope and fears of labor in the field and factory.\r\nEverywhere it was the policy of the new party to enlist the assistance\r\nof the weaker of the old parties. In the South, the Populists, as a\r\nrule, arrayed themselves with the Republicans against the old Democracy.\r\nThis provoked every device of ridicule, class prejudice, and scorn,\r\nwhich the dominant party could bring to bear to dissuade former\r\nDemocrats from voting the People's ticket. One Louisiana paper uttered\r\nthis warning:\r\n\r\nOily-tongued orators, in many cases the paid agents of the Republican\r\nparty, have for months been circulating among the unsophisticated and\r\nmore credulous classes, preaching their heresies and teaching the people\r\nthat if Weaver is elected president, money may be had for the asking,\r\ntransportation on the railroad trains will be practically free, the\r\nlaboring man will be transferred from his present position and placed\r\nupon a throne of power, while lakes filled with molasses, whose shores\r\nare fringed with buckwheat cakes, and islands of Jersey butter rising\r\nhere and there above the surface, will be a concomitant of every farm.\r\nThe 'forty-acres-and-a-mule' promises of the reconstruction era pale\r\ninto insignificance beside the glowing pictures of prosperity promised\r\nby the average Populist orator to those who support Weaver.\r\n\r\nThe Pensacola Address of the Populist nominees on September 17, 1892,\r\nwhich served as a joint letter of acceptance, was evidently issued at\r\nthat place and time partly for the purpose of influencing such voters as\r\nmight be won over by emphasizing the unquestioned economic distress of\r\nmost Southern farmers. If the new party could substantiate the charges\r\nthat both old parties were the tools of monopoly and Wall Street, it\r\nmight insert the wedge which would eventually split the \"solid South.\"\r\nEven before the Pensacola Address, the state elections in Alabama and\r\nArkansas demonstrated that coöperation of Republicans with Populists was\r\nnot an idle dream. But, although fusion was effected on state tickets in\r\nseveral States in the November elections, the outcome was the choice of\r\nCleveland electors throughout the South.\r\n\r\nAs the Populists tried in the South to win over the Republicans, so in\r\nthe North and more especially the West they sought to control the\r\nDemocratic vote either by fusion or absorption. The effort was so\r\nsuccessful that in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, and North Dakota,\r\nthe new party swept the field with the assistance of the Democrats. In\r\nSouth Dakota and Nebraska, where there was no fusion, the Democratic\r\nvote was negligible and the Populists ran a close second to the\r\nRepublicans.\r\n\r\nThat the tide of agrarianism was gradually flowing westward as the\r\nfrontier advanced is apparent from the election returns in the States\r\nbordering on the upper Mississippi. Iowa and Missouri, where the\r\nAlliance had been strong, experienced none of the landslide which swept\r\nout the Republicans in States further west. In Minnesota the Populists,\r\nwith a ticket headed by the veteran Donnelly, ran a poor third in the\r\nstate election, and the entire Harrison electoral ticket was victorious\r\nin spite of the endorsement of four Populist candidates by the\r\nDemocrats. In the northwestern part of the State, however, the new party\r\nwas strong enough to elect a Congressman over candidates of both the old\r\nparties. In no Northern State east of the Mississippi were the Populists\r\nable to make a strong showing; but in Illinois, the success of John P.\r\nAltgeld, the Democratic candidate for governor, was due largely to his\r\nadvocacy of many of the measures demanded by the People's party,\r\nparticularly those relating to labor, and to the support which he\r\nreceived from the elements which might have been expected to aline\r\nthemselves with the Populists. On the Pacific coast, despite the musical\r\ncampaign of Clark, Mrs. Lease, and Weaver, California proved deaf to the\r\nPeople's cause; but in Oregon the party stood second in the lists and in\r\nWashington it ran a strong third.\r\n\r\nMore than a million votes, nearly nine per cent of the total, were cast\r\nfor the Populist candidates in this election--a record for a third party\r\nthe year after its birth, and one exceeded only by that of the\r\nRepublican party when it appeared for the first time in the national\r\narena in 1856. Twenty-two electoral votes added point to the showing,\r\nfor hitherto, since 1860, third-party votes had been so scattered that\r\nthey had affected the choice of President only as a makeweight between\r\nother parties in closely contested States.\r\n\r\nA week after the elections General Weaver announced that the Populists\r\nhad succeeded far beyond their expectations. \"The Republican party,\" he\r\nasserted, \"is as dead as the Whig party was after the Scott campaign of\r\n1852, and from this time forward will diminish in every State of the\r\nUnion and cannot make another campaign.... The Populist will now\r\ncommence a vigorous campaign and will push the work of organization and\r\neducation in every county in the Union.\" There were those, however, who\r\nbelieved that the new party had made a great mistake in having anything\r\nto do with either of the old parties, that fusion, particularly of the\r\nsort which resulted in combination tickets, was a compromise with the\r\nenemy, and that more votes had been lost than won by the process. This\r\nfeeling found characteristic expression in an editorial in a Minnesota\r\npaper:\r\n\r\nTake an audience of republican voters in a schoolhouse where a county\r\nfusion has taken place--or the press is full of the electoral deal--and\r\nthe audience will applaud the sentiments of the speaker--but they wont\r\nvote a mongrel or democratic ticket! A wet blanket has been thrown!\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" says someone, \"but the democratic party is a party of reform!\"\r\nWell, my friend, you better go down south and talk that to the peoples\r\nparty where they have been robbed of their franchises by fraud and\r\noutrage!\r\n\r\nAh, and there the peoples party fused the republicans!!!\r\n\r\nOh whitewash! Where is thy lime-kiln, that we may swab off the dark\r\nblemishes of the hour!! Aye, and on the whited wall, draw thee a picture\r\nof power and beauty--Cleveland, for instance, thanking the peoples party\r\nfor all the favors gratuitously granted by our mongrel saints in\r\nspeckled linen and green surtouts.\r\n\r\nAs time gave perspective, however, the opinion grew that 1892 had\r\nyielded all that could possibly have been hoped. The lessons of the\r\ncampaign may have been hard, but they had been learned, and, withal, a\r\nstinging barb had been thrust into the side of the Republican party, the\r\norganization which, in the minds of most crusaders, was principally\r\nresponsible for the creation and nurture of their ills. It was generally\r\ndetermined that in the next campaign Populism should stand upon its own\r\nfeet; Democratic and Republican votes should be won by conversion of\r\nindividuals to the cause rather than by hybrid amalgamation of parties\r\nand preelection agreements for dividing the spoils. But it was just this\r\nfusion which blinded the eyes of the old party leaders to the\r\nsignificance of the Populist returns. Democrats, with a clear majority\r\nof electoral votes, were not inclined to worry about local losses or to\r\nvalue incidental gains; and Republicans felt that the menace of the\r\nthird party was much less portentous than it might have been as an\r\nindependent movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Issue\r\n\r\nA remarkable manifesto, dated February 22, 1895, summarized the\r\ngrievances of the Populists in these words:\r\n\r\nAs early as 1865-66 a conspiracy was entered into between the gold\r\ngamblers of Europe and America to accomplish the following purposes: to\r\nfasten upon the people of the United States the burdens of perpetual\r\ndebt; to destroy the greenbacks which had safely brought us through the\r\nperils of war; to strike down silver as a money metal; to deny to the\r\npeople the use of Federal paper and silver--the two independent sources\r\nof money guaranteed by the Constitution; to fasten upon the country the\r\nsingle gold standard of Britain, and to delegate to thousands of banking\r\ncorporations, organized for private gain, the sovereign control, for all\r\ntime, over the issue and volume of all supplemental paper currency.\r\n\r\nDeclaring that the \"international gold ring\" was summoning all its\r\npowers to strike at the prosperity of the country, the authors of this\r\naddress called upon Populists to take up the gauntlet and meet \"the\r\nenemy upon his chosen field of battle,\" with the \"aid and coöperation of\r\nall persons who favor the immediate free coinage of silver at a ratio of\r\n16-1, the issue of all paper money by the Government without the\r\nintervention of banks of issue, and who are opposed to the issue of\r\ninterest-bearing government bonds in the time of peace.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing new in this declaration of hostility to bank issues\r\nand interest-bearing bonds, nor in this demand for government paper\r\nmoney, for these prejudices and this predilection had given rise to the\r\n\"Ohio idea,\" by force of which George H. Pendleton had hoped to achieve\r\nthe presidency in 1868. These same notions had been the essence of the\r\nplatforms of the Greenback party in the late seventies; and they had\r\njostled government ownership of railroads for first place in\r\npronunciamentos of labor and agricultural organizations and of third\r\nparties all during the eighties. Free silver, on the other hand,\r\nalthough not ignored in the earlier period, did not attain foremost rank\r\namong the demands of the dissatisfied classes until the last decade of\r\nthe century and more particularly after the panic of 1893.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1874 or 1875 the \"silver question\" did not exist. In 1873\r\nCongress, moved by the report of a commission it had authorized, had\r\ndemonetized silver; that is, it had provided that the gold dollar should\r\nbe the standard of value, and omitted the standard silver dollar from\r\nthe list of silver coins. ¹ In this consisted the \"Crime of '73.\" At the\r\ntime when this law was enacted it had not for many years been profitable\r\nto coin silver bullion into dollars because silver was undervalued at\r\nthe established ratio of sixteen to one. In 1867 the International\r\nMonetary Conference of Paris had pronounced itself in favor of a single\r\ngold standard of currency, and the principal countries of Europe had\r\npreceded the United States in demonetizing silver or in limiting its\r\ncoinage. In 1874 as a result of a revision of the statutes of the United\r\nStates, the existing silver dollars were reduced to the basis of\r\nsubsidiary coins with only limited legal tender value.\r\n\r\n¹ The only reference to the dollar was to \"the trade dollar\" of heavier\r\nweight, for use in the Orient.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1873 was before Congress for four sessions; every section,\r\nincluding that which made gold the sole standard of value, was discussed\r\neven by those who later claimed that the Act had been passed\r\nsurreptitiously. Whatever opposition developed at this time was not\r\ndirected against the omission of the silver dollar from the list of\r\ncoins nor against the establishment of a single standard of value. The\r\nsituation was quickly changed, however, by the rapid decline in the\r\nmarket price of silver. The bimetallists claimed that this decline was a\r\nresult of the monetary changes; the advocates of the gold standard\r\nasserted that it was due to the great increase in the production of\r\nsilver. Whatever the cause, the result was that, shortly after silver\r\nhad been demonetized, its value in proportion to gold fell below that\r\nexpressed by the ratio of sixteen to one. Under these circumstances the\r\nproducers could have made a profit by taking their bullion to the mint\r\nand having it coined into dollars, if it had not been for the Act of\r\n1873. It is not strange, therefore, that the people of those Western\r\nStates whose prosperity depended largely on the silver mining industry\r\ndemanded the remonetization of this metal. At the same time the\r\nstringency in the money market and the low prices following the panic of\r\n1873 added weight to the arguments of those who favored an increase in\r\nthe quantity of currency in circulation and who saw in the free and\r\nunlimited coinage of silver one means of accomplishing this end. So\r\npowerful was the demand, especially from the West, that in 1878 the\r\nBland-Allison Act, passed over the veto of President Hayes, provided for\r\nthe restoration of the silver dollar to the list of coins, with full\r\nlegal tender quality, and required the Treasury to purchase in the open\r\nmarket from two to four million dollars' worth of bullion each month.\r\nThis compromise, however, was unsatisfactory to those who desired the\r\nfree coinage of silver, and it failed to please the champions of the\r\nsingle standard.\r\n\r\nFor ten years the question of a choice between a single standard or\r\nbimetallism, between free coinage or limited coinage of silver, was one\r\nof the principal economic problems of the world. International\r\nconferences, destined to have no positive results, met in 1878 and again\r\nin 1881; in the United States Congress read reports and debated measures\r\non coinage in the intervals between tariff debates. Political parties\r\nwere split on sectional lines: Western Republicans and Democrats alike\r\nwere largely in favor of free silver, but their Eastern associates as\r\ngenerally took the other side. Party platforms in the different States\r\ndiverged widely on this issue; and monetary planks in national\r\nplatforms, if included at all, were so framed as to commit the party to\r\nneither side. Both parties, however, could safely pronounce for\r\nbimetallism under international agreement, since there was little real\r\nprospect of procuring such an agreement. The minor parties as a rule\r\nfrankly advocated free silver.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, the subject of silver coinage assumed new importance. The\r\nsilverites in Congress were reënforced by representatives from new\r\nStates in the far West, the admission of which had not been unconnected\r\nwith political exigencies on the part of the Republican party. The\r\nadvocates of the change were not strong enough to force through a\r\nfree-silver bill, but they were able by skillful logrolling to bring\r\nabout the passage of the Silver Purchase Act. This measure, frequently\r\ncalled the Sherman Law, ¹ directed the Secretary of the Treasury to\r\npurchase, with legal tender Treasury notes issued for the purpose,\r\n4,500,000 ounces of pure silver each month at the market price. As the\r\nmetal was worth at that time about a dollar an ounce, this represented\r\nan increase, for the time being, over the maximum allowed under the\r\nBland-Allison Act and more than double the minimum required by that\r\nmeasure, which was all the Treasury had ever purchased. But the Silver\r\nPurchase Act failed to check the downward trend in the value of the\r\nmetal. The bullion in a silver dollar, which had been worth $1.02 in\r\n1872, had declined to seventy-two cents in 1889. It rose to seventy-six\r\nin 1891 but then declined rapidly to sixty in 1893, and during the next\r\nthree years the intrinsic value of a \"cartwheel\" was just about half its\r\nlegal tender value.\r\n\r\n¹ John Sherman, then Secretary of Treasury, had a large share in giving\r\nfinal form to the bill, which he favored only for fear of a still more\r\nobjectionable measure. See Sherman's Recollections, pp. 1069, 1188.\r\n\r\nEven under the Bland-Allison Act the Treasury Department had experienced\r\ngreat difficulty in keeping in circulation a reasonable proportion of\r\nthe silver dollars and the silver certificates which were issued in lieu\r\nof part of them, and in maintaining a sufficient gold reserve to insure\r\nthe stability of the currency. When the Silver Purchase Act went into\r\noperation, therefore, the monetary situation contributed its share to\r\nconditions which produced the panic of 1893. Thereupon the silver issue\r\nbecame more than ever a matter of nation-wide discussion.\r\n\r\nFrom the Atlantic to the Pacific the country was flooded with\r\ncontroversial writing, much of it cast in a form to make an appeal to\r\nclasses which had neither the leisure nor the training to master this\r\nvery intricate economic problem. W. H. Harvey's Coin's Financial School\r\nwas the most widely read campaign document, although hundreds of similar\r\npamphlets and books had an enormous circulation. The pithy and plausible\r\narguments of \"Coin\" and his ready answers to questions supposedly put by\r\nprominent editors, bankers, and university professors, as well as by J.\r\nR. Sovereign, master workman of the Knights of Labor, tickled the fancy\r\nof thousands of farmers who saw their own plight depicted in the crude\r\nbut telling woodcuts which sprinkled the pages of the book. In his\r\nmythical school \"the smooth little financier\" converted to silver many\r\nwho had been arguing for gold; but--what is more to the point--he also\r\nconvinced hundreds of voters that gold was the weapon with which the\r\nbankers of England and America had slain silver in order to maintain\r\nhigh interest rates while reducing prices, and that it was the tool with\r\nwhich they were everywhere welding the shackles upon labor. \"Coin\"\r\nharped upon a string to which, down to the time of the Spanish War, most\r\nAmericans were ever responsive--the conflict of interests between\r\nEngland and the United States. \"If it is claimed,\" he said, \"we must\r\nadopt for our money the metal England selects, and can have no\r\nindependent choice in the matter, let us make the test and find out if\r\nit is true.\" He pointed to the nations of the earth where a silver\r\nstandard ruled: \"The farmer in Mexico sells his bushel of wheat for one\r\ndollar. The farmer in the United States sells his bushel of wheat for\r\nfifty cents. The former is proven by the history of the world to be an\r\nequitable price. The latter is writing its history, in letters of blood,\r\non the appalling cloud of debt that is sweeping with ruin and desolation\r\nover the farmers of this country.\"\r\n\r\nWhen many men of sound reputation believed the maintenance of a gold\r\nstandard impossible what wonder that millions of farmers shouted with\r\n\"Coin\": \"Give the people back their favored primary money! Give us two\r\narms with which to transact business! Silver the right arm and gold the\r\nleft arm! Silver the money of the people, and gold the money of the\r\nrich. Stop this legalized robbery that is transferring the property of\r\nthe debtors to the possession of the creditors.... Drive these\r\nmoney-changers from our temples. Let them discover your aspect, their\r\nmasters--the people.\"\r\n\r\nThe relations of the Populist party to silver were at once the result of\r\nconviction and expediency; cheap money had been one, frequently the most\r\nprominent, of the demands of the farming class, not only from the\r\ninception of the Greenback movement, as we have seen, but from the very\r\nbeginning of American history. Indeed, the pioneer everywhere has needed\r\ncapital and has believed that it could be obtained only through money.\r\nThe cheaper the money, the better it served his needs. The Western\r\nfarmer preferred, other things being equal, that the supply of currency\r\nshould be increased by direct issue of paper by the Government. Things,\r\nhowever, were not equal. In the Mountain States were many interested in\r\nsilver as a commodity whose assistance could be counted on in a campaign\r\nto increase the amount of the metal in circulation. There were,\r\nmoreover, many other voters who, while regarding Greenbackism as an\r\neconomic heresy, were convinced that bimetallism offered a safe and\r\nsound solution of the currency problem. For the sake of added votes the\r\ninflationists were ready to waive any preference as to the form in which\r\nthe cheap money should be issued. Before the actual formation of the\r\nPeople's Party, the farmers' organizations had set out to capture votes\r\nby advocating free silver. After the election of 1892 free silver\r\ncaptured the Populist organization.\r\n\r\nHeartened by the large vote of 1892 the Populist leaders prepared to\r\ndrive the wedge further into the old parties and even hoped to send\r\ntheir candidates through the breach to Congress and the presidency. A\r\nsecret organization, known as the Industrial League of the United\r\nStates, in which the leaders were for the most part the prominent\r\nofficials of the People's Party, afforded for a time through its lodges\r\nthe machinery with which to control and organize the silverites of the\r\nWest and the South.\r\n\r\nThe most notable triumph of 1893 was the selection of Judge William V.\r\nAllen, by the Democrats and Independents of Nebraska, to represent that\r\nState in the United States Senate. Born in Ohio, in a house which had\r\nbeen a station on the \"underground railroad\" to assist escaping negroes,\r\nAllen at ten years of age had gone with his family to Iowa. After one\r\nunsuccessful attempt, he enlisted in the Union Army at the age of\r\nfifteen and served from 1862 to the end of the War. When peace came, he\r\nresumed his schooling, attended college, studied law, and in 1869 was\r\nadmitted to the bar. In 1884 he went to Madison County, Nebraska, where\r\nseven years later he was elected district judge by the Populists. Reared\r\nin a family which had been Republican, he himself had supported this\r\nparty until the campaign of 1890. \"I have always,\" said he, \"looked upon\r\na political party ... simply as a means to an end. I think a party\r\nshould be held no more sacred than a man's shoes or garments, and that\r\nwhenever it fails to subserve the purposes of good government a man\r\nshould abandon it as cheerfully as he dispenses with his wornout\r\nclothes.\" As Senator, Allen attracted attention not only by his powers\r\nof physical endurance as attested by a fifteen-hour speech in opposition\r\nto the bill for the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act, but also by his\r\nintegrity of character. \"If Populism can produce men of Senator Allen's\r\nmold,\" was the comment of one Eastern review, \"and then lift them into\r\npositions of the highest responsibility, one might be tempted to suggest\r\nthat an epidemic of this Western malady would prove beneficial to some\r\nEastern communities and have salutary results for the nation at large.\"\r\n\r\nIn this same year (1893) Kansas became a storm-center in national\r\npolitics once more by reason of a contest between parties for control of\r\nthe lower house of the legislature. The returns had given the\r\nRepublicans a majority in the assembly, but several Republican seats had\r\nbeen contested on suspicion of fraud. If the holders of these seats were\r\ndebarred from voting, the Populists could outvote the Republicans. The\r\nsituation itself was fraught with comedy; and the actions of the\r\ncontestants made it nothing less than farce. The assembly convened on\r\nthe 10th of January, and both Republican and Populist speakers were\r\ndeclared duly elected by their respective factions. Loftily ignoring\r\neach other, the two speakers went to the desk and attempted to conduct\r\nthe business of the house. Neither party left the assembly chamber that\r\nnight; the members slept on the benches; the speakers called a truce at\r\ntwo in the morning, and lay down, gavels in hand, facing each other\r\nbehind the desk, to get what rest they could. For over two weeks the two\r\nhouses continued in tumultuous session. Meanwhile men were crowding into\r\nTopeka from all over the State: grim-faced Populist farmers, determined\r\nthat Republican chicanery should not wrest from them the fruits of the\r\nelection; equally determined Republicans, resolved that the Populists\r\nshould not, by charges of election fraud, rob them of their hard-won\r\nmajority. Both sides came armed but apparently hoping to avoid\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the 15th of February, the Populist house retreated from the\r\nchamber, leaving the Republicans in possession, and proceeded to\r\ntransact business of state in the corridor of the Capitol. Populist\r\nsympathizers now besieged the assembly chamber, immuring the luckless\r\nRepublicans and incidentally a few women who had come in as members of\r\nthe suffrage lobby and were now getting more of political equality than\r\nthey had anticipated. Food had to be sent through the Populist lines in\r\nbaskets, or drawn up to the windows of the chamber while the Populist\r\nmob sat on the main stairway within. Towards evening, the Populist\r\njanitor turned off the heat; and the Republicans shivered until oil\r\nstoves were fetched by their followers outside and hoisted through the\r\nwindows. The Republican sheriff swore in men of his party as special\r\ndeputies; the Populist governor called out the militia.\r\n\r\nThe situation was at once too absurd and too grave to be permitted to\r\ncontinue. \"Sockless\" Jerry Simpson now counseled the Populists to let\r\nthe decision go to the courts. The judges, to be sure, were Republican;\r\nbut Simpson, ever resourceful, argued that if they decided against the\r\nPopulists, the house and senate could then impeach them. Mrs. Lease,\r\nhowever, was sure that the Populists would not have the courage to take\r\nup impeachment proceedings, and the event proved her judgment correct.\r\nWhen the struggle was finally brought to an end with the assistance of\r\nthe judicial machinery, the Republicans were left in control of the\r\nhouse of representatives, while the Populists retained the senate. In\r\njoint session the Republicans could be outvoted; hence a silver\r\nDemocrat, John Martin, was sent to Washington to work with Peffer in the\r\nSenate for the common cause of silver.\r\n\r\nThe congressional and state elections of 1894 revealed the unstable\r\nequilibrium of parties, and at the same time the total Populist vote of\r\nnearly a million and a half reflected the increasing popular unrest. In\r\nthe West, however, the new party was not so successful in winning\r\nelections as it had been in 1892 because the hostile attitude, sometimes\r\nof the Populists and sometimes of the Democrats, made fusion impossible\r\nin most cases. A few victories were won, to be sure: Nebraska elected a\r\nfree-silver Democrat-Populist governor, while Nevada was carried by the\r\nsilver party; but Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, Kansas, and North Dakota\r\nreturned to the Republican fold. In the South, the fusion between\r\nPopulists and Republicans against the dominant Democrats was more\r\nsuccessful. From several States, Congressmen were elected, who, whether\r\nunder the name of Populist or Republican, represented the radical\r\nelement. In South Carolina the Democratic party adopted the Farmers'\r\nAlliance platform, swept the State in the elections, and sent\r\n\"Pitchfork\" Tillman to the United States Senate as an\r\nanti-administration Democrat. Tillman admitted that he was not one of\r\nthose infatuated persons who believed that \"all the financial wisdom in\r\nthe country is monopolized by the East,\" and who said, \"'Me, too,' every\r\ntime Cleveland grunts.\" \"Send me to Washington,\" was his advice to\r\ncheering crowds, \"and I'll stick my pitchfork into his old ribs!\"\r\n\r\nEvery political move in 1895 was calculated with reference to the\r\npresidential election of 1896. Both old parties were inoculated with the\r\nfree-silver virus; silver men could have passed a free coinage bill in\r\nboth houses of Congress at any moment but were restrained chiefly by the\r\nknowledge that such a measure would be vetoed by President Cleveland.\r\nThe free coinage of silver, which was the chief demand of Populism, was\r\nalso the ardent desire of a majority of the people west of the\r\nAlleghanies, irrespective of their political affiliations. Nothing\r\nseemed more logical, then, than the union of all silver men to enforce\r\nthe adoption of their program. There was great diversity of opinion,\r\nhowever, as to the best means of accomplishing this union. General\r\nWeaver started a movement to add the forces of the American Bimetallic\r\nLeague and the silver Democrats to the ranks of the People's Party. But\r\nthe silver Democrats, believing that they comprised a majority of the\r\nparty, proceeded to organize themselves for the purpose of controlling\r\nthat party at its coming national conventions; and most of the Populist\r\nleaders felt that, should this movement be victorious, the greatest\r\nprospect of success for their program lay in a fusion of the two\r\nparties. Some there were, indeed, who opposed fusion under any\r\nconditions, foreseeing that it would mean the eventual extinction of the\r\nPeople's Party. Prominent among these were Ignatius Donnelly of\r\nMinnesota, \"General\" J. S. Coxey of Ohio, and Senator Peffer of Kansas.\r\nIn the South the \"middle-of-the-road\" element, as the opponents of\r\nfusion were called, was especially strong, for there the Populists had\r\nbeen coöperating with the Republicans since 1892, and not even agreement\r\non the silver issue could break down the barrier of antagonism between\r\nthem and the old-line Democrats.\r\n\r\nIt remained, then, for the political events of 1896 to decide which way\r\nthe current of Populism would flow--whether it would maintain an\r\nindependent course, receiving tributaries from every political source,\r\neventually becoming a mighty river, and, like the Republican party of\r\n1856 and 1860, sweeping away an older party; or whether it would turn\r\naside and mingle with the stream of Democracy, there to lose its\r\nidentity forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of the Standards\r\n\r\nWhen the Republicans met in convention at St. Louis in the middle of\r\nJune, 1896, the monetary issue had already dwarfed all other political\r\nquestions. It was indeed the rock on which the party might have crashed\r\nin utter shipwreck but for the precautions of one man who had charted\r\nthe angry waters and the dangerous shoals and who now had a firm grasp\r\non the helm. Marcus A. Hanna, or \"Uncle Mark,\" was the genial owner of\r\nmore mines, oil wells, street railways, aldermen, and legislators than\r\nany other man in Ohio. Hanna was an almost perfect example of what the\r\nPopulists denounced as the capitalist in politics. Cynically declaring\r\nthat \"no man in public life owes the public anything,\" he had gone his\r\nunscrupulous way, getting control of the political machine of Cleveland,\r\nacquiring influence in the state legislature, and now even assuming\r\ndictatorship over the national Republican party. Because he had found\r\nthat political power was helpful in the prosecution of his vast business\r\nenterprises, he went forth to accumulate political power, just as\r\nfrankly as he would have gone to buy the machinery for pumping oil from\r\none of his wells. Hanna was a stanch friend of the gold standard, but he\r\nwas too clever to alienate the sympathies of the Republican silverites\r\nby supporting the nomination of a man known to be an uncompromising\r\nadvocate of gold. He chose a safer candidate, a man whose character he\r\nsincerely admired and whose opinions he might reasonably expect to\r\nsway--his personal friend, Major William McKinley. This was a clever\r\nchoice: McKinley was known to the public largely as the author of the\r\nMcKinley tariff bill; his protectionism pleased the East; and what was\r\nknown of his attitude on the currency question did not offend the West.\r\nIn Congress he had voted for the Bland-Allison bill and had advocated\r\nthe freer use of silver. McKinley was, indeed, an ideally \"safe\"\r\ncandidate, an upright, affable gentleman whose aquiline features\r\nconferred on him the semblance of commanding power and masked the\r\nessential weakness and indecision which would make him, from Mark\r\nHanna's point of view, a desirable President. McKinley would always swim\r\nwith the tide.\r\n\r\nIn his friend's behalf Hanna carried on a shrewd campaign in the\r\nnewspapers, keeping the question of currency in the background as far as\r\npossible, playing up McKinley's sound tariff policy, and repeating often\r\nthe slogan--welcome after the recent lean years--\"McKinley and the full\r\ndinner pail.\" McKinley prudently refused to take any stand on the\r\ncurrency question, protesting that he could not anticipate the party\r\nplatform and that he would be bound by whatever declarations the party\r\nmight see fit to make. Even after the convention had opened, McKinley\r\nand Hanna were reticent on the silver question. Finally, fearing that\r\nsome kind of compromise would be made, the advocates of the gold\r\nstandard went to Mr. Hanna and demanded that a gold plank be\r\nincorporated in the platform. Hanna gracefully acceded to their demands\r\nand thus put them under obligation to repay him by supporting McKinley\r\nfor the nomination. The platform which was forthwith reported to the\r\nconvention contained the unequivocal gold plank, as Hanna had long\r\nbefore planned. Immediately thereafter a minority of thirty-four\r\ndelegates, led by Senator Teller of Colorado, left the convention, later\r\nto send out an address advising all Republicans who believed in free\r\ncoinage of silver to support the Democratic ticket. The nomination of\r\nWilliam McKinley and Garret A. Hobart followed with very little\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing cut and dried about the Democratic convention which\r\nassembled three weeks later in Chicago. The Northeastern States and a\r\nfew others sent delegations in favor of the gold standard, but free\r\nsilver and the West were in the saddle. This was demonstrated when, in\r\nthe face of all precedent, the nominee of the national committee for\r\ntemporary chairman was rejected in favor of Senator John W. Daniel of\r\nVirginia, a strong silver man. The second day of the convention saw the\r\nadvantage pushed further: each Territory had its representation\r\nincreased threefold; of contesting delegations those who represented the\r\ngold element in their respective States were unseated to make way for\r\nsilverites; and Stephen M. White, one of the California senators, was\r\nmade permanent chairman.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the convention the platform, devoted largely to the\r\nmoney question, was the subject of bitter debate. \"We are unalterably\r\nopposed to monometallism, which has locked fast the prosperity of an\r\nindustrial people in the paralysis of hard times,\" proclaimed the report\r\nof the committee on resolutions. \"Gold monometallism is a British\r\npolicy, and its adoption has brought other nations into financial\r\nservitude to London.... We demand the free and unlimited coinage of both\r\ngold and silver at the present legal ratio of sixteen to one without\r\nwaiting for the aid or consent of any other nation.\" A minority of the\r\ncommittee on resolutions proposed two amendments to the report, one\r\npronouncing in favor of a gold standard, and the other commending the\r\nrecord of Grover Cleveland, a courtesy always extended to a presidential\r\nincumbent of the same party. At the name of Cleveland, Senator Tillman\r\nleaped to his feet and delivered himself of characteristic invective\r\nagainst the President, the \"tool of Wall Street,\" the abject slave of\r\ngold. Senator David B. Hill of New York, who had been rejected for\r\ntemporary chairman, defended the gold plank in a logical analysis of\r\nmonetary principles. But logical analysis could not prevail against\r\nemotion; that clamorous mass of men was past reasoning now, borne they\r\nhardly knew whither on the current of their own excitement. He might as\r\nwell have tried to dam Niagara.\r\n\r\nOthers tried to stem the onrushing tide but with no better success. It\r\nseemed to be impossible for any one to command the attention and respect\r\nof that tumultuous gathering. Even Senator James K. Jones of Arkansas, a\r\nmember of the majority group of the committee on resolutions, failed\r\nequally with Tillman to give satisfactory expression to the sentiments\r\nof that convention, which felt inchoately what it desired but which\r\nstill needed a leader to voice its aspirations. This spokesman the\r\nconvention now found in William Jennings Bryan, to whom after a few\r\nsentences Senator Jones yielded the floor.\r\n\r\nBryan appeared in Chicago as a member of the contesting silver\r\ndelegation from Nebraska. A young man, barely thirty-six years old, he\r\nhad already become a well-known figure in the West, where for years he\r\nhad been expounding the doctrine of free silver. A native of Illinois,\r\nwhither his father had come from Culpeper County, Virginia, Bryan had\r\ngrown up on a farm. His father's means had been ample to afford him a\r\ngood education, which he completed, so far as schooling was concerned,\r\nat Illinois College, Jacksonville, and at the Union College of Law in\r\nChicago. While in Chicago Bryan was employed in the law office of Lyman\r\nTrumbull, one of the stanchest representatives of independence in\r\npolitics--an independence which had caused him to break with the\r\nDemocratic party over the slavery issue, and which, as expressed in his\r\nvote against the impeachment of President Johnson, had resulted in his\r\nretirement to private life. To the young law student Trumbull took a\r\nparticular fancy, and his dominating personality exerted an abiding\r\ninfluence over the character and career of his protégé.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief period of law practice in Jacksonville, Illinois, Bryan\r\nremoved with his family to Lincoln, Nebraska. The legal profession never\r\nheld great attraction for him, despite the encouragement and assistance\r\nof his wife, who herself took up the study of law after her marriage and\r\nwas admitted to the bar. Public questions and politics held greater\r\ninterest for the young man, who had already, in his college career,\r\nshown his ability as an orator. Nebraska offered the opportunity he\r\ncraved. At the Democratic state convention in Omaha in 1888 he made a\r\nspeech on the tariff which gave him immediately a state-wide reputation\r\nas an orator and expounder of public issues. He took an active part in\r\nthe campaign of that year, and in 1889 was offered, but declined, the\r\nnomination for lieutenant governor on the Democratic ticket. In 1890 he\r\nwon election to Congress by a majority of seven thousand in a district\r\nwhich two years before had returned a Republican, and this he\r\naccomplished in spite of the neglect of party managers who regarded the\r\ndistrict as hopeless. In Congress he became a member of the Committee on\r\nWays and Means. On the floor of the House his formal speeches on the\r\ntariff, a topic to which nothing new could be brought, commanded the\r\nattention of one of the most critical and blasé audiences of the world.\r\nThe silver question, which was the principal topic before Congress at\r\nthe following session, afforded a fresher field for his oratory; indeed,\r\nBryan was the principal aid to Bland both as speaker and parliamentarian\r\nin the old leader's monetary campaign. When Bryan sat down after a\r\nthree-hour speech in which he attacked the gold standard, a colleague\r\nremarked, \"It exhausts the subject.\" In 1894 a tidal wave of\r\nRepublicanism destroyed Bryan's chances of being elected United States\r\nSenator, a consummation for which he had been laboring on the stump and,\r\nfor a brief period, as editor of the Omaha World-Herald. He continued,\r\nhowever, to urge the silver cause in preparation for the presidential\r\ncampaign of 1896.\r\n\r\nTaller and broader than most men and of more commanding presence, Bryan\r\nwas a striking figure in the convention hall. He wore the inevitable\r\nblack suit of the professional man of the nineties, but his dress did\r\nnot seem conventional: his black tie sat at too careless an angle; his\r\nblack hair was a little too long. These eccentricities the cartoonists\r\nseized on and exaggerated so that most people who have not seen the man\r\npicture Bryan, not as a determined looking man with a piercing eye and\r\ntightset mouth, but as a grotesque frock-coated figure with the sombrero\r\nof a cow-puncher and the hair of a poet. If the delegates at the\r\nconvention noticed any of these peculiarities as Bryan arose to speak,\r\nthey soon forgot them. His undoubted power to carry an audience with him\r\nwas never better demonstrated than on that sweltering July day in\r\nChicago when he stilled the tumult of a seething mass of 15,000 people\r\nwith his announcement that he came to speak \"in defense of a cause as\r\nholy as the cause of liberty--the cause of humanity,\" and when he\r\nstirred the same audience to frenzy with his closing defiance of the\r\nopponents of free silver:\r\n\r\nIf they say bimetallism is good, but that we cannot have it until other\r\nnations help us, we reply that, instead of having a gold standard\r\nbecause England has, we will restore bimetallism, and then let England\r\nhave bimetallism because the United States has it. If they dare to come\r\nout in the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing, we\r\nwill fight them to the uttermost. Having behind us the producing masses\r\nof this nation and the world, supported by the commercial interests, the\r\nlaboring interests, and the toilers everywhere, we will answer their\r\ndemand for a gold standard by saying to them: You shall not press down\r\nupon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify\r\nmankind upon a cross of gold.\r\n\r\nMeeting Senator Hill's careful arguments with a clever retort, blunting\r\nthe keenness of his logic with a well-turned period, polished to\r\nperfection by numerous repetitions before all sorts of audiences during\r\nthe previous three or four years, Bryan held the convention in the\r\nhollow of his hand. The leadership which had hitherto been lacking was\r\nnow found. The platform as reported by the committee was adopted by a\r\nvote of more than two to one; and the convention, but for the opposition\r\nof Bryan himself, would have nominated him on the spot. The next day it\r\ntook but five ballots to set aside all the favorite sons, including the\r\n\"Father of Free Silver\" himself, Richard P. Bland, and to make Bryan the\r\nstandard bearer of the party.\r\n\r\nFar different in character and appearance from the Republican group\r\nwhich had assembled in the same building a few weeks before, was the\r\nPopulist convention which met in St. Louis late in July. Many of the\r\n1300 delegates were white-haired and had grown old in the service of\r\nreform in the various independent movements of preceding years; some of\r\nthem had walked long distances to save railroad fare, while others were\r\nso poor that, having exhausted their small store of money before the\r\nlong-drawn-out convention adjourned, they suffered from want of regular\r\nsleeping places and adequate food. All were impressed with the\r\nsignificance of the decision they must make.\r\n\r\nGone were the hopes of the past months; the Populist party would not\r\nsweep into its ranks all anti-monopolists and all silverites--for one of\r\nthe old parties had stolen its loudest thunder! It was an error of\r\npolitical strategy to place the convention after those of the two great\r\nparties in the expectation that both would stand on a gold platform. Now\r\nit was for these delegates to decide whether they would put their\r\norganization behind the Democratic nominee with a substantial prospect\r\nof victory, or preserve intact the identity of the Populist party, split\r\nthe silver vote, and deliver over the election to a gold Republican.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the delegates, believing that the Democratic party had\r\nbeen inoculated with the serum of reform, were ready for the sake of a\r\nprinciple to risk the destruction of the party they had labored so hard\r\nto build. Senator William V. Allen of Nebraska summed up the situation\r\nwhen he said:\r\n\r\nIf by putting a third ticket in the field you would defeat free coinage;\r\ndefeat a withdrawal of the issue power of national banks; defeat\r\nGovernment ownership of railroads, telephones and telegraphs; defeat an\r\nincome tax and foist gold monometallism and high taxation upon the\r\npeople for a generation to come, which would you do? ... When I shall go\r\nback to the splendid commonwealth that has so signally honored me beyond\r\nmy merits, I want to be able to say to the people that all the great\r\ndoctrines we have advocated for years, have been made possible by your\r\naction. I do not want them to say that the Populists have been advocates\r\nof reforms when they could not be accomplished, but when the first ray\r\nof light appeared and the people were looking with expectancy and with\r\nanxiety for relief, the party was not equal to the occasion; that it was\r\nstupid; it was blind; it kept \"the middle of the road,\" and missed the\r\ngolden opportunity.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the members of the convention were ready to coöperate\r\nwith the Democrats, there was a very strong feeling that something\r\nshould be done, if possible, to preserve the identity of the Populist\r\nparty and to safeguard its future. An active minority, moreover, was\r\nopposed to any sort of fusion or coöperation. This \"middle-of-the-road\"\r\ngroup included some Western leaders of prominence, such as Peffer and\r\nDonnelly, but its main support came from the Southern delegates. To them\r\nan alliance with the Democratic party meant a surrender to the enemy, to\r\nan enemy with whom they had been struggling for four years for the\r\ncontrol of their state and local governments. Passionately they pleaded\r\nwith the convention to save them from such a calamity. Well they knew\r\nthat small consideration would be given to those who had dared stand up\r\nand oppose the ruling aristocracy of the South, who had even shaken the\r\nDemocratic grip upon the governments of some of the States. Further, a\r\nnegro delegate from Georgia portrayed the disaster which would overwhelm\r\nthe political aspirations of his people if the Populist party, which\r\nalone had given them full fellowship, should surrender to the Democrats.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of fusion won their first victory in the election of\r\nSenator Allen as permanent chairman, by a vote of 758 to 564. As the\r\nnomination of Bryan for President was practically a foregone conclusion,\r\nthe \"middle-of-the-road\" element concentrated its energies on preventing\r\nthe nomination of Arthur Sewall of Maine, the choice of the Democracy,\r\nfor Vice-President. The convention was persuaded, by a narrow margin, to\r\ntake the unusual step of selecting the candidate for Vice-President\r\nbefore the head of the ticket was chosen. On the first ballot Sewall\r\nreceived only 257 votes, while 469 were cast for Thomas Watson of\r\nGeorgia. Watson, who was then nominated by acclamation, was a country\r\neditor who had made himself a force in the politics of his own State and \r\nhad served the Populist cause conspicuously in Congress. Two motives\r\ninfluenced the convention in this procedure. As a bank president, a\r\nrailroad director, and an employer of labor on a large scale, Sewall was\r\nfelt to be utterly unsuited to carry the standard of the People's Party.\r\nMore effective than this feeling, however, was the desire to do\r\nsomething to preserve the identity of the party, to show that it had not\r\nwholly surrendered to the Democrats. It was a compromise, moreover,\r\nwhich was probably necessary to prevent a bolt of the \r\n\"middle-of-the-road\" element and the nomination of an entirely\r\nindependent ticket.\r\n\r\nEven with this concession the Southern delegates continued their\r\nopposition to fusion. Bryan was placed in nomination, quite\r\nappropriately, by General Weaver, who again expressed the sense of the\r\nconvention: \"After due consideration, in which I have fully canvassed\r\nevery possible phase of the subject, I have failed to find a single good\r\nreason to justify us in placing a third ticket in the field.... I would\r\nnot endorse the distinguished gentleman named at Chicago. I would\r\nnominate him outright, and make him our own, and then share justly and\r\nrightfully in his election.\" The irreconcilables, nearly all from the\r\nSouth and including a hundred delegates from Texas, voted for S. F.\r\nNorton of Chicago, who received 321 votes as against 1042 for Bryan.\r\n\r\nBecause of the electoral system, the agreement of two parties to support\r\nthe same candidate for President could have no effect, unless\r\narrangements were made for fusion within the States. An address issued\r\nby the executive committee of the national committee of the People's\r\nParty during the course of the campaign outlined the method of uniting\r\n\"the voters of the country against McKinley,\" and of overcoming the\r\n\"obstacles and embarrassments which, if the Democratic party had put the\r\ncause first and party second,\" would not have been encountered: \"This\r\ncould be accomplished only by arranging for a division of the electoral\r\nvotes in every State possible, securing so many electors for Bryan and\r\nWatson and conceding so many to Bryan and Sewall. At the opening of the\r\ncampaign this, under the circumstances, seemed the wisest course for\r\nyour committee, and it is clearer today than ever that it was the only\r\nsafe and wise course if your votes were to be cast and made effective\r\nfor the relief of an oppressed and outraged people. Following this line\r\nof policy your committee has arranged electoral tickets in three-fourths\r\nof the States and will do all in its power to make the same arrangements\r\nin all of the States.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee felt it necessary to warn the people of the danger of \"a\r\ncertain portion of the rank and file of the People's Party being misled\r\nby so-called leaders, who, for reasons best known to themselves, or for\r\nwant of reason, are advising voters to rebel against the joint electoral\r\ntickets and put up separate electoral tickets, or to withhold their\r\nsupport from the joint electoral tickets.\" Such so-called leaders were\r\nsaid to be aided and abetted by \"Democrats of the revenue stripe, who\r\nare not yet weaned from the flesh-pots of Egypt,\" and by Republican\r\n\"goldbugs\" who in desperation were seizing upon every straw to prevent\r\nfusion and so to promote their own chances of success.\r\n\r\nIn the North and West, where the Populist had been fusing with the\r\nDemocrats off and on for several years, the combinations were arranged\r\nwith little difficulty. In apportioning the places on the electoral\r\ntickets the strength of the respective parties was roughly represented\r\nby the number of places assigned to each. Usually it was understood that\r\nall the electors, if victorious, would vote for Bryan, while the\r\nDemocrats would cast their second place ballots for Sewall and the\r\nPopulists for Watson.\r\n\r\nIn the South much more difficulty was experienced in arranging fusion\r\ntickets, and the spectacle of Populists coöperating with Republicans in\r\nstate elections and with Democrats in the national election illustrated\r\nthe truth of the adage that \"politics makes strange bedfellows.\" Only in\r\nArkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, and North Carolina, of the\r\nSouthern States, were joint electoral tickets finally agreed upon. In\r\nTennessee the Populists offered to support the Democratic electors if\r\nthey would all promise to vote for Watson, a proposal which was\r\nnaturally declined. In Florida the chairman of the state committee of\r\nthe People's Party, went so far on the eve of the election as to advise\r\nall members of the party to vote for McKinley; and in Texas there was an\r\norganized bolt of a large part of the Populists to the Republican party,\r\nnotwithstanding its gold standard and protective tariff platform.\r\n\r\nNo campaign since that of 1860 was so hotly and bitterly contested as\r\nthe \"Battle of the Standards\" in 1896. The Republicans broke all\r\nprevious records in the amount of printed matter which they scattered\r\nbroadcast over the country. Money was freely spent. McKinley remained at\r\nhis home in Canton, Ohio, and received, day after day, delegations of\r\npilgrims come to harken to his words of wisdom, which were then, through\r\nthe medium of the press, presented to similar groups from Maine to\r\nCalifornia. For weeks, ten to twenty-five thousand people a day sought\r\n\"the shrine of the golden calf.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Bryan, as the Democrat-Populist candidate, toured the\r\ncountry, traveling over thirteen thousand miles, reaching twenty-nine\r\nStates, and addressing millions of voters. It was estimated, for\r\ninstance, that in the course of his tour of West Virginia at least half\r\nthe electorate must have heard his voice. Most of the influential\r\nnewspapers were opposed to Bryan, but his tours and meetings and\r\nspeeches had so much news value that they received the widest publicity.\r\nAs the campaign drew to a close, it tended more and more to become a\r\nclass contest. That it was so conceived by the Populist executive\r\ncommittee is apparent from one of its manifestoes:\r\n\r\nThere are but two sides in the conflict that is being waged in this\r\ncountry today. On the one side are the allied hosts of monopolies, the\r\nmoney power, great trusts and railroad corporations, who seek the\r\nenactment of laws to benefit them and impoverish the people. On the\r\nother side are the farmers, laborers, merchants, and all others who\r\nproduce wealth and bear the burdens of taxation. The one represents the\r\nwealthy and powerful classes who want the control of the Government to\r\nplunder the people. The other represents the people, contending for\r\nequality before the law, and the rights of man. Between these two there\r\nis no middle ground.\r\n\r\nWhen the smoke of battle cleared away the election returns of 1896\r\nshowed that McKinley had received 600,000 more popular votes than Bryan\r\nand would have 271 electoral votes to 176 for the Democrat-Populist\r\ncandidate. West of the Mississippi River the cohorts of Bryan captured\r\nthe electoral vote in every State except California, Minnesota, North\r\nDakota, Iowa, and Oregon. The South continued its Democratic solidity,\r\nexcept that West Virginia and Kentucky went to McKinley. All the\r\nelectoral votes of the region east of the Mississippi and north of\r\nMason's and Dixon's line were Republican. The old Northwest, together\r\nwith Iowa, Minnesota, and North Dakota, a region which had been the\r\nprincipal theater of the Granger movement a generation before, now\r\njoined forces with the conservative and industrial East to defeat a\r\ncombination of the South with the newer agrarian and mining frontiers of\r\nthe West.\r\n\r\nThe People's Party had staked all on a throw of the dice and had lost.\r\nIt had given its life as a political organization to further the\r\nelection of Bryan, and he had not been elected. Its hope for independent\r\nexistence was now gone; its strength was considerably less in 1896 than\r\nit had been in 1892 and 1894. ¹ The explanation would seem to be, in\r\npart at least, that the People's Party was \"bivertebrate as well as\r\nbimetallic.\" It was composed of men who not long since had other\r\npolitical affiliations, who had left one party for the sake of the\r\ncause, and who consequently did not find it difficult to leave another\r\nfor the same reason. In the West large numbers of former Populists\r\nundoubtedly went over completely to the Democracy, even when they had\r\nthe opportunity of voting for the same Bryan electors under a Populist\r\nlabel. In the South many members of the party, disgusted at the\r\npredicament in which they found themselves, threw in their lot with the\r\nRepublicans. The capture of the Democracy by the forces of free silver\r\ngave the death blow to Populism.\r\n\r\n¹ Of the 6,509,000 votes which Bryan received, about 4,669,000 were cast\r\nfor the fusion electoral tickets. In only seven of the fusion States is\r\nit possible to distinguish between Democrat and Populist votes; the\r\ntotals here are 1,499,000 and 93,000 respectively. The fusion Populist\r\nvote of 45,000 was essential for the success of the Bryan electors in\r\nKansas; and in California the similar vote of 22,000, added to that of\r\nthe Democrats, gave Bryan one of the electors. In no other State in this\r\ngroup did the Populist vote have any effect upon the result. The part\r\nplayed by the People's party in the other twenty-two of the fusion\r\nStates is difficult to determine; in some cases, however, the situation\r\nis revealed in the results of state elections. The best example of this\r\nis North Carolina, where the Democrat-Populist electors had a majority\r\nof 19,000, while at the same election Fusion between Republicans and\r\nPopulists for all state officers except governor and lieutenant governor\r\nwas victorious. The Populist candidate for governor received about\r\n31,000 votes and the Republican was elected. It is evident that the\r\nthird party held the balance of power in North Carolina. The Populist\r\nvotes were probably essential for the fusion victories in Idaho,\r\nMontana, Nebraska, and Washington; but, as there was fusion on state\r\ntickets also, it is impossible to estimate the part played by the\r\nrespective parties. The total Populist vote in the ten States in which\r\nthere were independent Democratic and Populist electoral tickets was\r\n122,000 (of which 80,000 were cast in Texas and 24,000 in Alabama) and\r\nas none of the ten were close States the failure to agree on electoral\r\ntickets had no effect on the result. The \"middle-of-the-road\" Populist\r\nvotes, in States where there were also fusion tickets amounted to only\r\n8000--of which 6000 were cast in Pennsylvania and 1000 each in Illinois\r\nand Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe Populist vote as a whole was much larger than 223,000--the total\r\nusually given in the tables--for this figure does not include the vote\r\nin the twenty-two fusion States in which the ballots were not separately\r\ncounted. This is apparent from the fact that the twenty-seven electoral\r\nvotes from ten States which were cast for Watson came, with one\r\nexception, from States in which no separate Populist vote was recorded.\r\nIt is evident, nevertheless, from the figures in States where\r\ncomparisons are possible, that the party had lost ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nThe Leaven of Radicalism\r\n\r\nThe People's Party was mortally stricken by the events of 1896. Most of\r\nthe cohorts which had been led into the camp of Democracy were\r\nthereafter beyond the control of their leaders; and even the remnant\r\nthat still called itself Populist was divided into two factions. In 1900\r\nthe radical group refused to endorse the Fusionists' nomination of Bryan\r\nand ran an independent ticket headed by Wharton Barker of Pennsylvania\r\nand that inveterate rebel, Ignatius Donnelly. This ticket, however,\r\nreceived only 50,000 votes, nearly one-half of which came from Texas.\r\nWhen the Democrats nominated Judge Alton B. Parker of New York in 1904,\r\nthe Populists formally dissolved the alliance with the Democracy and\r\nnominated Thomas E. Watson of Georgia for President. By this defection\r\nthe Democrats may have lost something; but the Populists gained little.\r\nMost of the radicals who deserted the Democracy at this time went over\r\nto Roosevelt, the Republican candidate. In 1908 the Populist vote fell\r\nto 29,000; in 1912 the party gave up the ghost in a thinly-attended\r\nconvention which neither made nominations of its own nor endorsed any\r\nother candidate. In Congress the forces of Populism dwindled rapidly,\r\nfrom the 27 members of 1897 to but 10 in 1899, and none at all in 1903.\r\n\r\nThe men who had been leaders in the heyday of Populism retired from\r\nnational prominence to mere local celebrity. Donnelly died in 1901,\r\nleaving a picturesque legacy of friendships and animosities, of literary\r\ncontroversy and radical political theory. Weaver remained with the\r\nfusion Populists through the campaign of 1900; but by 1904 he had gone\r\nover to the Democratic party. The erstwhile candidate for the presidency\r\nwas content to serve as mayor of the small town of Colfax, Iowa, where\r\nhe made his home until his death in 1912, respected by his neighbors and\r\nforgotten by the world. Peffer, at the expiration of his term in the\r\nSenate, ran an unsuccessful tilt for the governorship of Kansas on the\r\nProhibition ticket. In 1900 he returned to the comfort of the Republican\r\nfold, to become an ardent supporter of McKinley and Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nBut the defection and death of Populist leaders, the collapse of the\r\nparty, and the disintegration of the alliances could not stay the\r\nfarmers' movement. It ebbed for a time, just as at the end of the\r\nGranger period, but it was destined to rise again. The unprecedented\r\nprosperity, especially among the farmers, which began with the closing\r\nyears of the nineteenth century and has continued with little reaction\r\ndown to the present has removed many causes for agrarian discontent; but\r\nsome of the old evils are left, and fresh grievances have come to the\r\nfront. Experience taught the farmer one lesson which he has never\r\nforgotten: that whether prosperous or not, he can and must promote his\r\nwelfare by organization. So it is that, as one association or group of\r\nassociations declines, others arise. In some States, where the Grange\r\nhas survived or has been reintroduced, it is once more the leading organ\r\nof the agricultural class. Elsewhere other organizations, sometimes\r\nconfined to a single State, sometimes transcending state lines, hold the\r\nfarmers' allegiance more or less firmly; and an attempt is now being\r\nmade to unite all of these associations in an American Federation of\r\nFarmers.\r\n\r\nUntil recently these orders have devoted their energies principally to\r\npromoting the social and intellectual welfare of the farmer and to\r\nbusiness coöperation, sometimes on a large scale. But, as soon as an\r\norganization has drawn into its ranks a considerable proportion of the\r\nfarmers of a State, especially in the West, the temptation to use its\r\npower in the field of politics is almost irresistible. At first,\r\npolitical activity is usually confined to declarations in favor of\r\nmeasures believed to be in the interests of the farmers as a class; but\r\nfrom this it is only a short step to the support of candidates for\r\noffice who are expected to work for those measures; and thence the\r\ngradation is easy to actual nominations by the order or by a farmers'\r\nconvention which it has called into being. With direct primaries in\r\noperation in most of the Western States, these movements no longer\r\nculminate in the formation of the third party but in ambitious efforts\r\nto capture the dominant party in the State. Thus in Wisconsin the\r\npresident of the state union of the American Society of Equity, a\r\nfarmers' organization which has heretofore been mainly interested in\r\ncoöperative buying and selling, was recently put forward by a \"Farmers\r\nand Laborers Conference\" as candidate for the nomination for governor on\r\nthe Republican ticket and had the active support of the official organ\r\nof the society. In North Dakota, the Non-Partisan League, a farmers'\r\norganization avowedly political in its purposes, captured the Republican\r\nparty a few years ago and now has complete control of the state\r\ngovernment. The attempt of the League to seize the reins in Minnesota\r\nhas been unsuccessful as yet, but Democratic and Republican managers are\r\nvery much alarmed at its growing power. The organized farmers are once\r\nmore a power in Western politics.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, by votes cast and elections won or by the permanence\r\nof parties and organizations that the political results of the agrarian\r\ncrusade are to be measured. The People's Party and its predecessors,\r\nwith the farmers' organizations which supported them, professed to put\r\nmeasures before men and promulgated definite programs of legislation.\r\nMany of the proposals in these programs which were ridiculed at the time\r\nhave long since passed beyond the stage of speculation and discussion.\r\nRegulation of railroad charges by national and state government,\r\ngraduated income taxes, popular election of United States Senators, a\r\nparcels post, postal savings banks, and rural free delivery of mail are\r\na few of these once visionary demands which have been satisfied by\r\nFederal law and constitutional amendment. Anti-trust legislation has\r\nbeen enacted to meet the demand for the curbing of monopolies; and the\r\nFederal land bank system which has recently gone into operation is\r\npractically the proposal of the Northwestern Alliance for government\r\nloans to farmers, with the greenback feature eliminated. Even the demand\r\nfor greater volume and flexibility of currency has been met, though in\r\nways quite different from those proposed by the farmers. ¹\r\n\r\n¹ In July, 1894, when the People's Party was growing rapidly, the editor\r\nof the Review of Reviews declared: \"Whether the Populist party is to\r\nprove itself capable of amalgamating a great national political\r\norganization or whether its work is to be done through a leavening of\r\nthe old parties to a more or less extent with its doctrines and ideas,\r\nremains to be seen. At present its influence evidently is that of a\r\nleavening ingredient.\" The inclusion of the income tax in the revenue\r\nbill put through by the Democratic majority in Congress was described as\r\n\"a mighty manifestation of the working of the Populist leaven\"; and it\r\nwas pointed out that \"the Populist leaven in the direction of free\r\nsilver at the ratio of 16 to 1 is working yet more deeply and\r\nominously.\" The truth of the last assertion was demonstrated two years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that the farmers' organizations and parties\r\nstood for increased governmental activity; they scorned the economic and\r\npolitical doctrine of laissez faire; they believed that the people's\r\ngovernments could and should be used in many ways for promoting the\r\nwelfare of the people, for assuring social justice, and for restoring or\r\npreserving economic as well as political equality. They were pioneers in\r\nthis field of social politics, but they did not work alone. Independent\r\nreformers, either singly or in groups, labor organizations and parties,\r\nand radicals everywhere coöperated with them. Both the old parties were\r\nsplit into factions by this progressive movement; and in 1912 a\r\nProgressive party appeared on the scene and leaped to second place in\r\nits first election, only to vanish from the stage in 1916 when both the\r\nold parties were believed to have become progressive.\r\n\r\nThe two most hopeful developments in American politics during recent\r\nyears have been the progressive movement, with its program of social\r\njustice, and the growth of independent voting--both developments made\r\npossible in large part by the agrarian crusade. Perhaps the most\r\nsignificant contribution of the farmers' movement to American politics\r\nhas been the training of the agricultural population to independent\r\nthought and action. No longer can a political party, regardless of its\r\nplatform and candidates, count on the farmer vote as a certainty. The\r\nresolution of the Farmers' Alliance of Kansas \"that we will no longer\r\ndivide on party lines and will only cast our votes for candidates of the\r\npeople, by the people, and for the people,\" was a declaration of a\r\npolitical independence which the farmers throughout the West have\r\nmaintained and strengthened. Each successive revolt took additional\r\nvoters from the ranks of the old parties; and, once these ties were\r\nsevered, even though the wanderers might return, their allegiance could\r\nbe retained only by a due regard for their interests and desires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.\r\n\r\nThe sources for the history of the agrarian crusade are to be found\r\nlargely in contemporary newspapers, periodical articles, and the\r\npamphlet proceedings of national and state organizations, which are too\r\nnumerous to permit of their being listed here. The issues of such\r\npublications as the Tribune Almanac, the Annual Cyclopedia (1862-1903),\r\nand Edward McPherson's Handbook of Politics (1868-1894) contain\r\nplatforms, election returns, and other useful material; and some of the\r\nimportant documents for the Granger period are in volume X of the\r\nDocumentary History of American Industrial Society (1911), edited by\r\nJohn R. Commons.\r\n\r\nWhen each wave of the movement for agricultural organization was at its\r\ncrest, enterprising publishers seized the opportunity to bring out books\r\ndealing with the troubles of the farmers, the proposed remedies, and the\r\norigin and growth of the orders. These works, hastily compiled for sale\r\nby agents, are partisan and unreliable, but they contain material not\r\nelsewhere available, and they help the reader to appreciate the spirit\r\nof the movement. Books of this sort for the Granger period include:\r\nEdward W. Martin's (pseud. of J. D. McCabe) History of the Grange\r\nMovement (1874), Jonathan Periam's The Groundswell (1874), Oliver H.\r\nKelley's Origin and Progress of the Order of the Patrons of Husbandry\r\n(1875), and Ezra S. Carr's The Patrons of Husbandry on the Pacific Coast\r\n(1875). Similar works induced by the Alliance movement are: History of\r\nthe Farmers' Alliance, the Agricultural Wheel, etc., compiled and edited\r\nby the St. Louis Journal of Agriculture (1890), Labor and Capital,\r\nContaining an Account of the Various Organizations of Farmers, Planters,\r\nand Mechanics (1891), edited by Emory A. Allen, W. Scott Morgan's\r\nHistory of the Wheel and Alliance and the Impending Revolution (1891),\r\nH. R. Chamberlain's The Farmers' Alliance (1891), The Farmers' Alliance\r\nHistory and Agricultural Digest (1891), edited by N. A. Dunning, and \r\nN. B. Ashby's The Riddle of the Sphinx (1890). Other contemporary books\r\ndealing with the evils of which the farmers complained are: D. C.\r\nCloud's Monopolies and the People (1873), William A. Peffer's The\r\nFarmer's Side (1891), James B. Weaver's A Call to Action (1891), Charles\r\nH. Otken's The Ills of the South (1894), Henry D. Lloyd's Wealth against\r\nCommonwealth (1894), and William H. Harvey's Coin's Financial School\r\n(1894).\r\n\r\nThe nearest approach to a comprehensive account of the farmers' movement\r\nis contained in Fred E. Haynes's Third Party Movements Since the Civil\r\nWar, with Special Reference to Iowa (1916). The first phase of the\r\nsubject is treated by Solon J. Buck in The Granger Movement (1913),\r\nwhich contains an extensive bibliography. Frank L. McVey's The Populist\r\nMovement (1896) is valuable principally for its bibliography of\r\ncontemporary material, especially newspapers and magazine articles. For\r\naccounts of agrarian activity in the individual States, the investigator\r\nturns to the many state histories without much satisfaction. Nor can he\r\nfind monographic studies for more than a few States. A. E. Paine's The\r\nGranger Movement in Illinois (1904 University of Illinois Studies, vol.\r\nI, No. 8) and Ellis B. Usher's The Greenback Movement of 1875-1884 and\r\nWisconsin's Part in It (1911) practically exhaust the list. Elizabeth N.\r\nBarr's The Populist Uprising, in volume II of William E. Connelley's\r\nStandard History of Kansas (1918), is a vivid and sympathetic but\r\nuncritical narrative. Briefer articles have been written by Melvin J.\r\nWhite, Populism in Louisiana during the Nineties, in the Mississippi\r\nValley Historical Review (June, 1918), and by Ernest D. Stewart, The\r\nPopulist Party in Indiana in the Indiana Magazine of History (December,\r\n1918). Biographical material on the Populist leaders is also scant. For\r\nDonnelly there is Everett W. Fish's Donnelliana (1892), a curious eulogy\r\nsupplemented by \"excerpts from the wit, wisdom, poetry and eloquence\" of\r\nthe versatile hero; and a life of General Weaver is soon to be issued by\r\nthe State Historical Society of Iowa. William J. Bryan's The First\r\nBattle (1896) and numerous biographies of \"the Commoner\" treat of his\r\nconnection with the Populists and the campaign of 1896. Herbert Croly's\r\nMarcus A. Hanna (1912) should also be consulted in this connection.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the general histories of the United States since the Civil\r\nWar devote considerable space to various phases of the farmers'\r\nmovement. The best in this respect are Charles A. Beard's Contemporary\r\nAmerican History (1914) and Frederic L. Paxson's The New Nation (1915).\r\nHarry Thurston Peck's Twenty Years of the Republic, 1885-1905 (1906)\r\ncontains an entertaining account of Populism and the campaign of 1896.\r\nPertinent chapters and useful bibliographies will also be found in the\r\nfollowing volumes of the American Nation: William A. Dunning's\r\nReconstruction, Political and Economic, 1865-1877 (1907), Edwin E.\r\nSparks's National Development, 1877-1885 (1907), and David R. Dewey's\r\nNational Problems, 1885-1897 (1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nAdams, C. F., candidate for presidential nomination, 15.\r\nAdams, D.

This book is part of the Chronicles of America series\r\nproduced by Yale University.\r\n\r\nThe footnotes have been produced using the Project Gutenberg™ standard.\r\nFootnotes follow the paragraph in which they were mentioned. Footnotes\r\nhave been set in smaller print and have larger margins than regular\r\ntext. \r\n\r\nOur policy in displaying footnotes may cause them to appear on the page\r\nfollowing the one where the footnote appears in the paper book. We have\r\ntherefore linked Index entries which refer to a footnote (denoted by\r\nnote) to the footnote itself, and not the page number. \r\n\r\nDetailed notes describe problems or issues in transcribing a specific\r\nportion of the text. Emendations are listed, and described, in the\r\nDetailed Notes, as well as other issues in transcribing the text. \r\n\r\n\r\nDetailed Notes Section:\r\n\r\n\r\nCooperation vs. Coöperation:\r\n\r\nOn Page 26, Page 113, and Page 119, cooperation is split between two\r\nlines for spacing. In those three instances where hyphenation was called\r\nfor, the umlat was not used in the book. When coöperation was not split\r\nbetween two lines for spacing, the book spelled the word with the umlat.\r\nThere are eighteen occurrences of coöperation. There were also eighteen\r\noccurrences of coöperative, all which used the umlat. Coöperate,\r\ncoöperated, and coöperating were also used with the umlat. Our\r\nassumption is that the umlat was omitted when coöperation was hyphenated\r\nfor spacing, but in transcribing the word, the hyphen is omitted and the\r\numlat should be restored. We have emended two cases in the index where\r\nthe umlat was not used. Therefore, we have consistently spelled all\r\nvariations of coöperate throughout the book, including the index, and\r\nfurthermore claim that we did not emend the text.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9:\r\n\r\nOn Page 128, non-political is hyphenated and split between two lines.\r\nLater on the page, non-political is hyphenated in the middle of a line.\r\nThere is one other use of non-political, on page 43, used with a hyphen.\r\nWe retained the hyphen in transcribing the quote: Let the Alliance be a\r\nbusiness organization for business purposes, and as such, necessarily\r\nsecret, and as secret, necessarily non-political.\r\n\r\nOn Page 132, log-rolling is hyphenated and split between two lines. On\r\nPage 159, logrolling is spelled without the hyphen. There are no other\r\noccurrences of the word. We removed the hyphen in transcribing the\r\nclause: By the familiar practice of \"logrolling\".\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10:\r\n\r\nOn Page 143, sub-treasury is hyphenated and split between two lines.\r\nThere are four occurrences of sub-treasury in the book, on pages 130-132\r\nof Chapter 8. There are no occurrences of sub-treasury spelled without\r\nthe hyphen. We have transcribed sub-treasury with the hyphen in the\r\nclause: with the sub-treasury system of loans.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11:\r\n\r\nOn Page 165, storm-center is hyphenated and split between two lines.\r\nThere are no other occurrences of the word in the book. In the index, on\r\npage 211, storm-center is hyphenated in the middle of the line. Because\r\nof this usage in the index, we retained the hyphen in the clause: Kansas\r\nbecame a storm-center ...",
