dates many years back. In his\r\nlife-long study of problems connected with dairy farming and milk\r\nindustries in two of the world’s greatest dairy countries, Denmark and\r\nthe United States, the author has felt the need of a concise handbook\r\ncovering this interesting subject. In his forty years of work in the\r\nmanufacture and distribution of dairy and milk-food preparations he has\r\nbeen brought constantly into contact with men and women interested in\r\nthe production of milk and has found a persistent demand for a book that\r\nmight be consulted by anybody in regard to questions related to these\r\ngreatest of all foods, which are, or ought to be, a most important part\r\nof the daily diet of children and adults alike, at all times,\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nThere was a time during the war when, frightened by the soaring of the\r\nprice which had remained remarkably low for many years, much too low in\r\nfact compared with the cost of other food, people began to cut down the\r\nconsumption of milk to an alarming extent. Even the National Food\r\nAdministration for a short time recommended saving in the wrong place,\r\nforgetting that, at the highest figures reached during the temporary\r\nshortage, milk was still one of the cheapest of foods and that it was\r\nabsolutely indispensable for growing children and exceedingly beneficial\r\nfor men and women who were called upon to exercise their physical and\r\nmental powers as never before. But with men like Dean Russell of the\r\nWisconsin Agricultural College in the Department and Dr. Graham Lusk of\r\nCornell University representing the United States on the Inter-Allied\r\nCouncil of Alimentation, the Food Administration could not long maintain\r\nthis mistaken attitude but quickly joined the College authorities and\r\nthe representatives of the dairy industry in advocating a liberal use of\r\nmilk. And the Department of Agriculture sent out over the country a\r\nlarge force of demonstrators to show the people how to use milk in\r\nmaking cottage cheese and many other ways, and Agricultural Colleges,\r\nFarm Bureaus and Home Economics Agents worked hand in hand with\r\nWashington in disseminating the knowledge of handling and utilizing\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nA genuine interest has been aroused in our country in the economy and\r\nconservation of food, and in “The Story of Milk” the author hopes to\r\nplace at the disposal of the student of Domestic Science a comprehensive\r\nbook of reference which may open the eyes of many to the fact that there\r\nis no more interesting subject than “Milk” in connection with the study\r\nof the welfare and physical improvement of humanity, and that milk and\r\nits products should be used to a much greater extent than heretofore.\r\n\r\nIt would make a long list of references if the author should mention the\r\nsources on which he has drawn for information beyond his own life-long\r\nexperience in the dairy and related industries. He desires to express\r\nhis sincere appreciation of the kindness and ready response of\r\ninstitutions and friends to whom he has appealed for photographs and\r\ncuts which have enabled him to illustrate the text so liberally. In the\r\nback of the book will be found a brief bibliography of standard dairy\r\nliterature in which students may find material for further information.\r\n\r\nMany interesting data and several excellent illustrations have been\r\nobtained from the bulletins and collections of the Department of\r\nAgriculture in Washington and the Dairy Schools at Ithaca, N.Y.,\r\nMadison, Wis., and Ames, Ia.\r\n\r\nThe Chapter on Milk Cookery was written and classified by the author’s\r\nwife, whose practical experience will make it useful alike to\r\nhousekeepers and students of Domestic Science.\r\n\r\n                                                      J. D. FREDERIKSEN.\r\n\r\nLittle Falls, N.Y.,\r\n\r\nApril, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HISTORICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk and its products have been known and used from time immemorial. In\r\nthe Bible milk and milk foods are mentioned in some thirty places. In\r\nGen. 18:8 we read: “... and he (Abraham’s servant) took butter and milk\r\nand set it before them ...”; 1 Sam. 17:28: “And Jesse said unto David,\r\nhis son: ... bring these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand\r\nand look how thy brethren fare....”; Prov. 30:33: “For the churning of\r\nmilk bringeth forth butter,” etc.\r\n\r\nThough in some of these passages butter is mentioned it is hardly\r\nprobably that this product was really made or used at the time under the\r\nclimatic conditions in Palestine. More likely it was various kinds of\r\ncurd and cheese which the translator called butter. At any rate, the\r\nHebrews of that far-off day coveted milk and its products among their\r\nmost valued foods. From Egyptian, Greek and Roman history it appears\r\nthat knowledge of cheese goes back to the most ancient times and that it\r\nwas made from the milk of sheep, goats, cows, asses, mares, in fact from\r\nall domestic animals; in the far North, Lapps and Eskimos still make it\r\nfrom the milk of the reindeer, the Arabs use camel’s milk, Llama cheese\r\nis famous in the Cordilleras and Zebu cheese in Ceylon and India.\r\n\r\nEven in ancient times the great food value of dairy products was\r\nrecognized. Plinius tells of Zoroaster that for twenty years he lived\r\nexclusively on cheese, and Plutarch calls cheese one of the most\r\nnourishing of foods.\r\n\r\nAs time went by, the cow excelled all other domestic animals in capacity\r\nfor the production of milk and by constant use through centuries for the\r\none special purpose,—by care in feeding, breeding and selection,—special\r\nbreeds of cattle were developed which gave milk in extraordinarily large\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  From Maelkeritidende, Copenhagen\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Thomas R. Segelcke, father of scientific dairying in Denmark\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  L. B. Arnold, noted dairy expert and writer, of Herkimer County, N.Y.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the cold climate of the northern countries where butter will keep for\r\na long time it has been made for centuries. The illustration above is\r\nfrom a mural painting in an old church in Finland. Evidently at the time\r\nwhen that was built the devil already played havoc with the churn and\r\neven up to the days of our grand-fathers his Satanic Majesty was often\r\naccused of preventing the butter from “coming.”\r\n\r\nNot until the middle of the nineteenth century did dairying take its\r\nplace among the important industries of the world and science begin to\r\nbe applied in its development. Between 1860 and 1870 Thomas R. Segelcke,\r\nthe “Father of Scientific Dairying” in Denmark, introduced the\r\nthermometer in churning instead of the rule of thumb and started the\r\nkeeping of records in the manufacture of butter. N. J. Fjord started a\r\nseries of experiments in the creameries, continued through the next\r\ndecades, and which became models for similar work throughout the world,\r\ncovering pasteurization, ice houses and cold storage, comparison between\r\nvarious systems for raising the cream, separators, feeding rations,\r\netc., and Denmark developed its agriculture and dairy industry to an\r\nenviable position. About the same time Dr. Schatzman applied scientific\r\nmethods in cheese making in Switzerland and Jesse Williams started the\r\nfirst American cheese factory near Rome, N.Y., while L. B. Arnold, X. A.\r\nWillard, Harris Lewis, Harry Burrell and many other progressive dairymen\r\nmade Herkimer County cheese famous.\r\n\r\nFrom New York, dairy farming spread rapidly westward through Ohio to\r\nMichigan and Northern Illinois, where butter making was developed around\r\nElgin, and to Wisconsin, where Governor Hoard preached the gospel of\r\nprogress, Babcock invented and gave to the world the famous test that\r\nbears his name and Russell made a specialty of dairy bacteriology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  J.

Monrad, Assistant Dairy Commissioner of Illinois, student, writer\r\nand lecturer on dairy subjects, collected and indexed one of the most\r\ncomplete and valuable libraries of dairy literature found anywhere,\r\nwhich after his death in 1915 was taken over and installed in special\r\nrooms by Chr. Hansen’s Laboratorium in Copenhagen, where a librarian is\r\nkeeping it up to date and it is open to the public.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, Dairy Commissioners Jas. W. Robertson and J. A. Ruddick, D.\r\nM. McPherson, the “Cheese King,” and others contributed to an enormous\r\ndevelopment of the manufacture of high-class cheese, and in New Zealand\r\nand Australia similar progress was made.\r\n\r\nBusiness and science have vied with each other in increasing the output\r\nof dairy products and improving their quality. In the table below,\r\nshowing estimates for 1917, some interesting figures are given of the\r\namount of milk produced in the United States and the uses to which it is\r\napplied.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Uses to which milk is put (calculations based on estimates)_\r\n\r\n        ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n                     Item                 Lbs. of Milk Per Cent\r\n        ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n        Product of 22,768,000 cows at   84,611,350,000       ──\r\n          3,716 lbs. per an.\r\n        Disposition of milk product:             ─────\r\n        1,650,000,000 lbs. of butter    34,663,850,000     41.0\r\n          (at 21 lbs. milk)\r\n        420,000,000 lbs. of cheese (at   4,200,000,000      5.0\r\n          10 lbs. milk)\r\n        975,000,000 lbs. of condensed    2,437,500,000      2.9\r\n          milk (at 2½ lbs. milk)\r\n        210,000,000 gals. of ice cream   3,150,000,000      3.7\r\n          (weighing 6 lbs. to the\r\n          gallon, 10% fat)\r\n        100,000,000 persons; 45% at     36,500,000,000     43.1\r\n          0.7 lb. a day (cities) farms\r\n          with dairy cows, 30%, 1.5\r\n          lbs. per day; other farms\r\n          and small towns, 25%, 1 lb.\r\n          a day, approximately\r\n        17,500,000 calves, whole milk    3,660,000,000      4.3\r\n          (estimated) requirement\r\n                                                 ─────\r\n        Total                           84,611,350,000    100.0\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the table accounts for all the milk produced, it does not tell\r\nthe whole story, since the preparation of a number of products results\r\nin the formation of vast quantities of by-products that are not used to\r\nthe fullest advantage for human food.\r\n\r\nNew York City alone consumes 1,600,000 quarts of milk a day, but even\r\nthis enormous quantity means only 0.6 pint per capita. The consuming\r\npublic has been slow to realize the value of milk and its products, and\r\ntoo much emphasis cannot be laid upon the fact that even at the largely\r\nincreased cost of all dairy products they are still some of the cheapest\r\nand the most healthful of foods, especially for growing children, and\r\nshould be used in much larger quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE STORY OF MILK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE STORY OF MILK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  PRODUCTION, COMPOSITION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MILK, MILK FERMENTS,\r\n                             PASTEURIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DAIRY CATTLE\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Holstein\r\n]\r\n\r\nA number of typical but widely different breeds of dairy cows have been\r\ndeveloped in various dairy countries, each owing to the soil and the\r\nclimatic conditions of its home, as well as to the skill and fancy of\r\nthe breeders, its characteristic features, form, color, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Herd of pure-bred Holstein cows on a farm in central New York\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Milk-Breeds.=—The black and white _Holstein-Friesians_ (which, by the\r\nway, had their home in Holland and not in Holstein) are known for their\r\nlarge production of not very rich milk, while the _Guernseys_ and\r\n_Jerseys_ give milk exceedingly rich in butter-fat. A good Holstein cow\r\nwill give from 7,000 to 10,000 lbs. of milk in a year, containing from\r\n3¼% to 4% butter-fat. Some of them produce as much as 20,000 to 30,000\r\nlbs. in a year—nearly 4,000 gallons—just think of it! Jersey cows will\r\nusually not produce as much in quantity as the Holsteins but Jersey milk\r\noften contains 5% or 6% or more butter-fat, and a few of the best have\r\nbeen known to produce 800 to 900 lbs. of butter in one year, an amount\r\nequal to the cow’s own weight. The red _Danish_ cow is an exceedingly\r\ngood and highly bred milk producer which, however, has not been\r\nintroduced in the United States, but the Scotch _Ayrshires_ and the\r\n_Brown Swiss_ are other well-known dairy breeds which are in favor with\r\nmany American farmers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Guernsey\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut, alas! too many herds of dairy cattle average less than 5,000 lbs.\r\nof milk per cow per year and do not pay for their feed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Jersey cows\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Red Danish\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Ayrshire\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Shorthorn, beef-strain\r\n]\r\n\r\nMany native cows respond, however, to good care and feed and with a\r\nthoroughbred bull a satisfactory herd can readily be built up from\r\ncarefully selected native stock. Such continued cross-breeding is more\r\napt to succeed than attempts to cross two thoroughbred breeds because\r\nthe characteristic features in full-blooded animals are so strong as to\r\ninvariably predominate in the progeny over the less pronounced forms and\r\ntendencies inherent in native cows. But where two full-blooded animals\r\nare mated and the strong characteristics in each are fighting for\r\npredominance the result is apt to be a poor, ill-proportioned offspring\r\nas the result of atavism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Shorthorn, milk-strain\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Beef-Cattle.=—Cattle bred and developed for the purpose of producing\r\nbeef rather than milk are called by contrast beef-cattle. As examples of\r\nbeef-cows look at the _Shorthorns_ or the _Herefords_ or the _Polled\r\nAngus_ at the next State Fair you visit and notice the square, deep,\r\nsmooth body with muscles and fat strongly developed in contrast to the\r\nloosely built, bony milk-cow with its tendency to turn all its food into\r\nmilk at the expense of the body. There are, however, also among the\r\nShorthorns, strains of good milkers, but as a rule these beef-breeds are\r\nnot selected for the dairy farm, and “dual purpose” cows are not usually\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\n=Food and Water.=—The natural food for the dairy cow in summer is grass,\r\nand where rich, succulent grass and clover grow in abundance, as on the\r\nfertile meadows of Holland and the Channel Islands, or the Swiss Alps,\r\nthe highly cultivated Danish farms, the eastern and middle-western\r\nstates of America, etc., dairying early reached its highest development.\r\nAs the value of milk and its products for human food became more\r\ngenerally recognized and all-the-year-round production was forced, it\r\nwas found necessary to feed the cows heavily in winter too, not only\r\nhay, but also grain and succulent food such as beets and corn-ensilage\r\n(green corn cut, stalks, cobs and all, and packed in a silo), and\r\nscience was taken into play to formulate _Balanced Rations_ containing\r\nthe proper amounts and proportions of the various nutrients—Protein, Fat\r\nand Carbohydrates. It is not the place here to go deeper into this\r\nproblem which has long been a subject for thorough research and\r\nexperiments. In fact, more attention has been paid to the feeding of\r\ncattle than to the proper nourishment of human beings, and much of what\r\nwe know about the latter has been deducted from experience and study on\r\nthe dairy farm, and from laboratory work along that line. In the chapter\r\non “Milk as a Food” we are taking up food values, etc., in relation to\r\nthe feeding of children and men. Suffice it here to say that the same\r\nfundamental principles apply to the feeding of calves and cattle for the\r\nproduction of milk and beef. And we wish to emphasize the fact that,\r\nwith due consideration to the proper proportion between the various\r\ngroups of nutrients, it is much more important that the food is\r\nsucculent, appetizing and easily digestible than that the ration shall\r\nbe accurately balanced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Cutting ensilage and filling the silo\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis fact, long well known to practical breeders and dairymen, has\r\nrecently been confirmed by Dr. E. V. McCullom to whose experiments\r\nfurther reference is made in the chapter on milk as a food for children.\r\nHe shows that there is a very great difference in the quality of Protein\r\nand Fat from various sources and that there is “Something Unknown” in\r\nbutter-fat, for instance, which is absent in most other fats and which\r\nis vital for the growth of the child as well as for the proper\r\nnourishment of man. This unknown but essential substance is also found,\r\nin small quantities, in the leaves of certain plants, as in alfalfa,\r\nwhile it is absent in the grain of the cereals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  An abundant crop of alfalfa hay; cut three times during the summer.\r\n    Supplies protein in the ration\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn modern dairy farming _alfalfa_ is considered an indispensable source\r\nfor protein, and corn-ensilage or beets for carbohydrates, while bran,\r\ncottonseed meal or oil cake, malt-sprouts, gluten, distillers’ grain,\r\netc., may be used to advantage in various combinations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Cows milked with machine\r\n]\r\n\r\nContrary to a general impression one cannot feed fat into the milk. A\r\nlarge amount of oil cake or other food rich in fat in the daily ration\r\ndoes not increase the percentage of butter-fat in the milk. Rather, it\r\ndepends largely upon the breed and to some extent upon the period of\r\nlactation. Provided the food agrees with her digestion and keeps the cow\r\nin a good, healthy condition, the composition of the milk is not changed\r\nto any appreciable extent by a change in make-up of the food.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that to produce from 20 to 50 lbs. of milk a day\r\nthe cow must have an abundance of _fresh, pure water_ to drink and she\r\nshould not have access to stagnant water.\r\n\r\n=The Barn= must be clean, light and well ventilated and the cows should\r\nbe milked with clean hands into a clean pail which is covered as far as\r\npossible so as to prevent dust from falling into the milk, or with one\r\nof the excellent milking machines which are now frequently used in large\r\ndairies. The milk is strained and cooled immediately after milking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Milking machine\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  In the partly covered milk-pail dust does not fall as readily as in\r\n    the one entirely open\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Milking.=—The cows are usually milked twice a day; occasionally, when\r\nthe highest possible yield is desired, as in important tests, three or\r\nfour times. The first five days after the birth of the calf the\r\nmilk,—the Colostrum so called,—is not normal and should not be used for\r\nhuman consumption. It may be fed to the calf. The first three to four\r\nmonths the yield of milk generally is higher than later, when it\r\ngradually drops until after about ten months it stops altogether and the\r\ncow goes “dry” at least for some six weeks before dropping the next\r\ncalf. The highest annual yield may be obtained by having the cows “come\r\nin” in the Fall or early Winter and feeding them well all Winter to keep\r\nup an abundant flow of milk. Then, when they come out on pasture in the\r\nSpring,—in the latitude of the Great Lakes about May 15th,—the fresh,\r\nrich feed will stimulate production and give it a fresh start so that\r\nthe milk-pail may continue to be filled during the next few months and\r\nthe shrinkage of the yield will not occur until the time when the\r\npastures dry up. The cow will then go dry in the early Fall, when feed\r\nis scarce. Usually, however, the cows are allowed to “come in” in the\r\nSpring and the yield of milk begins to shrink in the late Summer with\r\nlittle or nothing in the Winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Milking on a Danish farm\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Test the Cows.=—To ascertain if a cow pays for her feed the amount and\r\nthe quality of the milk should be tested and computed for the year. If\r\nthe milk from each cow cannot be weighed every day it may be done\r\nregularly once a month or preferably oftener. If it is weighed morning\r\nand evening once every ten days it is easy to keep the account by\r\nmultiplying the number of pounds by ten and adding the totals for the\r\nyear. Occasionally the milk may be subjected to the Babcock Test to\r\nascertain its richness; three or four times during the period of\r\nlactation is sufficient.\r\n\r\nWhere farmers do not have time to do the testing themselves they often\r\ncombine and hire a young man or woman, trained in an agricultural\r\ncollege, to go around from farm to farm and do the work. These experts\r\nnot only test the yield and the percentage of fat but also weigh and\r\ncompute the feed so as to help the farmer make up his rations and\r\ncalculate whether each cow pays for her feed or not. The members of\r\nthese associations meet and compare notes and a friendly rivalry is\r\nstimulated which may do much toward increasing production. As a matter\r\nof fact, where Cow Test Associations have been introduced, both yield\r\nand quality of the milk have been largely increased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Bernhard Bang of Copenhagen, Denmark\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Healthy Cows= alone can be depended upon to produce sanitary milk. In\r\nmany herds of milk-cows tuberculosis is prevalent, and constant\r\nvigilance is necessary to prevent its spread. The _Tuberculin Test_\r\ndiscovered by Koch is invaluable for the purpose of ascertaining the\r\npresence of tuberculosis. It is not necessary, however, to kill every\r\ninfected animal. Only where the lungs or the udder is affected and a\r\nphysical examination shows an advanced stage of the disease such radical\r\nmeans are advisable. When the tuberculin test was first introduced many\r\nvaluable herds were wantonly and foolishly killed off because some of\r\nthe highly developed dairy cows showed reaction to the test while\r\nworthless scrubs were allowed to live and spread the disease. For only\r\nthe intelligent and public-spirited owners of fine herds submitted their\r\ncows to the test, a reaction to which, under ill-advised regulations,\r\npermitted state officials to condemn the infected herds. In Denmark Dr.\r\nBernhard Bang introduced a system of isolation of the infected animals\r\nwhich together with _Compulsory Pasteurization_ of the milk from such\r\ncows has proved efficient for the eradication of tuberculosis, and the\r\n_Bang Method_ is now generally recognized as the proper way of handling\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       COMPOSITION OF COW’S MILK\r\n\r\n             Cow’s milk contains on an average in 100 lbs.:\r\n\r\n                87 lbs. of water\r\n                 4 lbs. of butter-fat\r\n                3¼ lbs. of casein and albumin (protein)\r\n                 5 lbs. of milk sugar\r\n                 ¾ lbs. of ash (mineral matter)\r\n                   100 lbs. total.\r\n\r\nIt consists therefore of 87% water and 13% “solids,” 4 of which are fat\r\nand 9, “solids—not fat.” =Butter-Fat= is found in milk in the form of\r\nminute globules suspended in the liquid. As fat or oil is lighter than\r\nwater (has less specific gravity) it naturally floats and the fat\r\nglobules therefore soon rise to the top when milk stands at rest,\r\nforming a layer of _cream_ which may be skimmed off from the _milk_. In\r\nchemical composition butter-fat is very nearly the same as other animal\r\nand vegetable fats, but the slight variation may make a lot of\r\ndifference in digestibility and palatability as well as in nutritive\r\nvalue, and it is a mistake to consider Oleomargarine, Butterine,\r\nNut-Butter and other substitutes for butter “just as good” because a\r\nchemical analysis shows them to contain “almost” the same elements or\r\ncompounds. These products may be good and legitimate if sold for what\r\nthey are, but should never be allowed to be sold or served for what they\r\nare not, genuine butter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Composition of cow’s milk\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Casein and Albumin= are the proteids or nitrogenous matters of the\r\nmilk, in chemical composition and in food value much the same as the\r\nprotein in beans and peas or in meat, or the white of eggs. Casein is\r\npresent in much larger quantity than albumin and is distinguished from\r\nthe latter by being precipitated by rennet, which has no effect on\r\nalbumin. Casein may also be precipitated by acids, while it required\r\nboiling as well as acidity to throw the albumin out of solution.\r\n\r\n=Milk-Sugar= is related to the vegetable sugars, glucose, cane sugar,\r\netc., and remains in solution in the whey which separates out from the\r\ncheese-curd when milk is curdled with rennet or acids. The whey also\r\ncontains the mineral matters or _ash_, which consists largely of\r\nphosphate of lime, of use to the young in building up bones. When whey\r\nis boiled down to a thick syrup and left to stand, the sugar will\r\ncrystallize out and may be separated from the liquid, still holding in\r\nsolution the mineral matters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fat globules as they appear under the microscope\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Mineral Matters.=—These may be gathered as _ash_ by boiling off the\r\nwater from this liquid or from the whole milk and burning the rest, as\r\nall the constituents except the ash belong to what in chemistry is\r\ncalled organic matter, which disappears in the air by burning.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Dr. S. M. Babcock of Madison, Wis.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                            HOW TO TEST MILK\r\n\r\nMilk may be adulterated or decreased in value either by skimming or by\r\nwatering. In either case the percentage of the most valuable\r\nconstituent, the butter-fat, is diminished. It is upon this fact that\r\nthe most practical test, the Babcock, is based.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Babcock test outfit\r\n]\r\n\r\n=The Babcock Test.=[2]—By treating a sample of milk with strong\r\nsulphuric acid the butter-fat is liberated as an oil. By subjecting the\r\nmixture to centrifugal force the light butter oil is separated from the\r\nrest of the milk and the percentage can be easily determined.\r\nCentrifugal force had already been used in the Fjord Cream Test, but it\r\nremained for Dr. Babcock to work out the splendid practical and reliable\r\ntest which bears his name and in which he has given to the world an\r\ninvention of incalculable value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A two-bottle machine\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Sampling.=—Whether it is new milk or skim milk or buttermilk or cream\r\nthat is to be tested the first thing to observe is to take a _truly\r\nrepresentative sample_. The liquid must be thoroughly mixed by pouring\r\nit several times from one vessel to another, or stirring vigorously.\r\n\r\nIt may not always be convenient to make a test immediately when the\r\nsample is taken. In the creamery where the milk is paid for according to\r\nits fat contents, samples are taken every day from every patron’s milk\r\nand it would take too much time for the butter maker to test all of\r\nthese samples before they would spoil. A preservative, corrosive\r\nsublimate,—poisonous but all right for the purpose,—is therefore added\r\nand all the samples of one farmer’s milk for several days or a whole\r\nweek are put together in one glass to be kept and tested at one time.\r\nThis is called a composite test and has proven entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\n=The Lactometer= has been used to discover adulterations, depending upon\r\nthe difference in specific gravity of the various constituents. The\r\nspecific gravity of whole milk is about 1.032 which means that, if a\r\ncertain volume of water weighs 1.000 weight units, the same volume of\r\nwhole milk weighs 1.032, the same volume of butter-fat weighs, say,\r\n.900, or of cream about 1.000, and of skim milk 1.036 units. If the\r\nLactometer shows a sample of milk to have a higher specific gravity than\r\n1.032 it may therefore be suspected of having been skimmed. But it will\r\nreadily be seen that by removing from whole milk some of the cream and\r\nadding water, the specific gravity can easily be brought back to normal\r\nfor whole milk. This test is therefore unreliable and has been discarded\r\nwith the advent of the Babcock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The acidemeter\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Acidity Test.=[3]—The acidity, or sourness, of milk or cream, which\r\ndepends upon the amount of lactic acid developed in it, may be tested by\r\na liquid normal alkali or by the Farrington Alkaline Tablets, a solution\r\nof which added to sour milk neutralizes the acid. A few drops of an\r\nindicator, Phenolpthalein, added to the milk, turns it pink when all the\r\nacid has been neutralized, and the amount of alkali solution used shows\r\nthe percentage of acid in the milk. This is quite important in preparing\r\n“starters” for ripening the cream in butter making or milk in cheese\r\nmaking, and in the manufacture of “Commercial Buttermilk,” etc.\r\n\r\nThere are other tests used in scientific dairying as the _Fermentation\r\nTest_ to ascertain the relative purity of milk, the _Casein Test_, etc.,\r\nbut the above are those mostly used besides the _Bacterial Count_ which\r\nis mentioned under the chapter on “Milk Supply,” and the _Rennet Test_\r\ndescribed under “Cheese Making.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FERMENTS\r\n\r\nTwo classes of ferments are of importance in connection with milk: (1)\r\n“unorganized” or chemical ferments, the “enzymes,” and (2) “organized”\r\nferments such as bacteria and yeast.\r\n\r\n                               _Enzymes_\r\n\r\n=Rennet.=—Among the unorganized ferments, _Rennet_ or _Rennin_ is highly\r\nimportant on account of its power of coagulating or curdling milk by\r\nprecipitation of the casein. Rennet is extracted from the stomach of the\r\nsuckling or milk-fed calf, where it serves in digesting the calf’s food.\r\nIt is in the market in the form of a liquid extract as well as a dry\r\npowder compressed into tablets (Rennet Tablets and Junket Tablets). The\r\ncharacteristics and use of rennet are described under “Cheese Making” in\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\n=Pepsin= is another enzyme the office of which in the process of\r\ndigestion is to dissolve albuminoids. It is not considered identical\r\nwith rennet though in an acid solution it will curdle milk. It occurs in\r\nthe stomachs of grown animals fed on solid food and is usually produced\r\nfrom hogs’ stomachs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Bacteria\r\n\r\nEverywhere, in the air, in water, in the soil, and clinging to every\r\nobject in the world, are minute organisms known under the common names\r\nof _bacteria_ or _microbes_. In contrast to rennet and the other\r\n“unorganized” ferments, bacteria belong to the “organized” class. Some\r\nare harmful, producing putrefaction, dissolution, poisons or disease;\r\nothers are beneficial, leading to desirable fermentations and changes;\r\nothers again are indifferent, neither good nor bad, but harmless.\r\n\r\nAs the milk comes from the cow it is almost free from bacteria, but milk\r\nmakes an excellent soil for many of these organisms to grow in, and they\r\nsoon get in, to multiply with enormous rapidity at any temperature from\r\n60° to 100° F.\r\n\r\n=Lactic Acid Bacilli= are bacteria of special importance to the\r\ndairyman, for they convert sugar of milk into lactic acid and produce\r\nvarious more or less agreeable flavors. They are also powerful\r\ngermicides and scavengers, destroying or neutralizing the products of\r\nother bacteria which in the absence of these bacteria and the lactic\r\nacid produced by them would play havoc with the food and produce\r\nputrefaction or disease. Everybody who handles milk knows that pure sour\r\nmilk or buttermilk in which lactic acid bacteria abound keeps well for a\r\nlong time, free from other fermentations which have no chance to develop\r\nin their presence. It is due to this purifying property that Metchnikoff\r\nrecommended Bulgarian sour milk as a health food, asserting that it\r\nprevents harmful fermentations in the digestive channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Control of Bacteria\r\n\r\nThe principal means at our disposal to prevent or control and regulate\r\nbacterial growth are:\r\n\r\n_Cleanliness_, _Heat_, _Cold_ and _Disinfectants_.\r\n\r\n=Cleanliness.=—Only the most scrupulous cleanliness will prevent\r\ncontamination. Hence the necessity of thorough scouring and sterilizing\r\nof all utensils, and the need for fresh air and pure water.\r\n\r\n=Heat.=—The prevention of fermentation in milk by heating is called\r\n“sterilization” or “pasteurization” according to the intensity of the\r\nheat and the length of time the milk is subjected to it. Boiling\r\ndestroys almost all bacterial life. Some germs require, however,\r\nexposure to a much higher temperature, up to 250° F. (boiling under\r\npressure), to be entirely eradicated, but for all practical purposes a\r\nthorough boiling is considered sufficient to eliminate all danger of\r\ncontamination. Such boiling is usually termed _Sterilization_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Effect of heating milk to various temperatures.\r\n  Published by the Toronto Board of Health\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Cooling= checks bacterial growth and but few germs thrive at a\r\ntemperature below 50° F. The following table and diagram[4] show how\r\nquickly bacteria multiply in milk at ordinary room temperature, 68° to\r\n70°, which emphasizes the importance of keeping milk cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Relative growth of bacteria when held at different temperatures_\r\n\r\n   ──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────\r\n             │  No. of  │          │          │          │\r\n    Tem. of  │ bacteria │  At end  │At end of │At end of │At end of\r\n      Milk   │ per c.c. │of 6 hrs. │ 12 hrs.  │ 24 hrs.  │ 40 hrs.\r\n             │    at    │          │          │          │\r\n             │beginning │          │          │          │\r\n   ──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n      °F.    │          │          │          │          │\r\n       50    │    10    │    12    │    15    │    41    │    62\r\n       68    │    10    │    17    │   242    │  61,280  │3,574,990\r\n   ──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Milk cooler\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf the milk had contained 1,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter at the\r\nbeginning, the part held at 50° F. would have contained 4,100 bacteria\r\nat the end of 24 hours, while that held at 68° F. would have contained\r\n6,128,000. The effect of temperature upon the growth of bacteria is\r\nshown graphically in the cut.\r\n\r\nBut even _frost does not kill_ the bacteria. If milk which has been kept\r\nsweet or at the desired degree of sourness by cooling is allowed to get\r\nwarm again, the bacteria which have been kept dormant will get a fresh\r\nstart. For this reason milk and cream for city supply should not only be\r\ncooled strongly, but must be kept thoroughly chilled up to the time they\r\nare used, which means that they should be delivered cool to the\r\nconsumer, and kept on ice in the house, never being allowed to warm up\r\nuntil used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The diagram (after Conn) shows the rapidity with which bacteria\r\n    multiply in milk not properly cooled.

These lower temperatures are recommended in the case of new milk\r\nto be consumed as such, in order not to change its digestibility.\r\nPasteurizers with “holding devices” are therefore largely taking the\r\nplace of the “continuous” sterilizing machines, which allow only\r\nmomentary exposure to the highest temperature.\r\n\r\nWhatever method is used it is essential that after the heating is\r\nfinished the milk should be cooled as quickly as possible to a\r\ntemperature sufficiently low to prevent development of the germs that\r\nhave not been entirely destroyed by the heat and which, if the milk is\r\nleft for any length of time at a temperature favorable for bacterial\r\nlife—anywhere between 65° and 110°,—will begin to grow again. Cool the\r\nmilk to below 60° and if possible to 50° or 40°.\r\n\r\nSometimes a second pasteurization is practiced, the milk being purposely\r\nallowed to stand at 70° to 80° for 12 to 24 hours after the first\r\npasteurization for the germs which escaped destruction to develop into\r\nfull-grown bacteria. They are then killed by the second heating before\r\nthe milk is finally chilled to stop any further growth.\r\n\r\nPasteurization can be done by placing the milk in any tin or enamelled\r\nor glass vessel, set in another vessel containing water (a double\r\nboiler). Heat until the milk has reached the desired temperature, hold\r\nit at that temperature the necessary time, and then place the vessel in\r\ncold running water or in ice water until the milk is thoroughly chilled.\r\nIt is not advisable to place the hot milk in the ice box as cooling in\r\nair is too slow. Not until it is thoroughly cooled in water is it safe\r\nto put it in the ice box to _keep_ it cool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  N. J.

Fjord, in Denmark, applied to milk the\r\nprocess which had been developed by Louis Pasteur in France to give\r\nkeeping quality to wine and beer. A Danish dairy expert, J. Moldenhauer,\r\nnow connected with the New York State Department of Agriculture, first\r\nbrought the process to this country and used pasteurization in a city\r\ncreamery in Kentucky. American experiment stations established the\r\ntemperatures and the time of exposure necessary for best results, and no\r\none has done more for the introduction of pasteurization than the New\r\nYork philanthropist, Nathan Straus, who has established pasteurizing\r\nplants and milk distributing stations in many localities, thereby\r\ncontributing so largely to the lowering of the death rate among the\r\nchildren of the poor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Straus Pasteurizer\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A continuous pasteurizer\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe following directions are given by the Straus Pasteurized Milk\r\nLaboratories of New York for the pasteurization of milk for babies:\r\n\r\n1. Only use fresh, filtered milk, which has been kept cold, and proceed\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n2. Set the bottles, after they have been thoroughly cleaned, into the\r\ntray (a), fill them to the neck, and put on the corks or patent\r\nstoppers.\r\n\r\n3. The pot (b) is then placed on a wooden surface (table or floor) and\r\nfilled to the three supports (in the pot) with boiling water.\r\n\r\n4. Place tray (a), with the filled bottles, into the pot (b), so that\r\nthe bottom of the tray rests on the three supports, and put cover (c) on\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Milk cooler\r\n]\r\n\r\n5. After the bottles have been warmed up by the steam for five minutes,\r\nremove the cover quickly, turn the tray so that it drops into the water.\r\nThe cover is to be put on again immediately. This manipulation is to be\r\nmade very quickly, so that as little steam as possible can escape. Thus\r\nit remains for twenty-five minutes.\r\n\r\n6. Now take the tray out of the water and cool the bottles with cold\r\nwater and ice as quickly as possible, and keep them at this low\r\ntemperature till used.\r\n\r\n7. Before use, warm the milk—in the bottles—to blood heat. Never pour it\r\ninto another vessel.\r\n\r\n8. The milk must not be used for children later than twenty-four hours\r\nafter pasteurization. Never use remnants.\r\n\r\nIn a _Continuous Pasteurizer_ a constant stream of milk is fed into the\r\nmachine, heated by flowing over a metal surface with steam or hot water\r\non the opposite side, and cooled by running over a cooler furnished with\r\na stream of cold water or ice water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PURE CULTURES\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Professor V. Storch, originator of pure cultures for ripening cream\r\n    and milk\r\n]\r\n\r\nBefore 1890 it was supposed that the flavor of fine butter depended upon\r\ncertain volatile oils and acids peculiar to butter-fat. In the early\r\nnineties Professor V. Storch of the Danish Experiment Station showed,\r\nhowever, that it was due rather to the products of bacteria and he\r\nisolated the lactic acid bacilli which would produce such exquisite\r\nflavor even when perfectly neutral and tasteless butter-fat was churned\r\nwith milk acidified or ripened with a pure culture of these bacilli. In\r\nthis country Dr. H. W. Conn of Wesleyan University, Storrs, Conn., did\r\nmuch to advance the theory and practice of ripening cream with a pure\r\nculture starter.\r\n\r\n“Pure cultures” are produced in the bacteriological laboratory by\r\npicking out under the microscope colonies of the desired species of\r\nbacteria, planting them in a sterilized medium and allowing them to grow\r\nunder the most favorable conditions and with the exclusion of all other\r\ngerms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Streptococcus lacticus (Storch, No. 18)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Bacterium lactis acidi (from Storch)\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen such a culture has reached its maximum growth it is transplanted\r\ninto a larger quantity of a sterilized medium containing proper\r\nnourishment for the particular organism. In the bacteriological\r\nlaboratory, where alone absolute sterility of utensils and medium, and\r\nentire exclusion of foreign infection are possible, the culture may\r\nremain pure while this inoculation and propagation are repeated over and\r\nover again. But when the propagation is carried on in the house or the\r\ndairy, for instance in preparing starters or buttermilk, such absolute\r\ncleanliness is impossible and in the long run infections will creep in\r\nfrom the air or from the utensils and after a while it becomes necessary\r\nto start with a new “pure culture.” How often such renewal must be\r\nresorted to depends largely upon the surroundings and the care of the\r\noperator. Usually it must be done after a week’s time, although it is\r\nsurprising to find milk preparations made by the simplest processes\r\nequal in purity to those prepared with the assistance of bacteriological\r\nscience and technique. This is, for instance, the case in Bulgaria,\r\nwhere the famous Yoghourt sour milk is prepared pure without special\r\ncare and in Denmark where the country is fairly permeated with the\r\nlactic acid bacilli used in ripening the cream for the celebrated Danish\r\nbutter and where careful buttermakers often maintain their starters for\r\nmonths or even for years without “renewal.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Typical lactic acid bacteria\r\n  (L. A. Rogers)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are many different varieties of bacteria which convert sugar of\r\nmilk into lactic acid, at the same time developing flavors more or less\r\nagreeable and characteristic for the various products. In the\r\nbacteriological laboratory certain species are selected which will\r\nproduce the results desired for the particular purpose in view.\r\n\r\n=Starters.=—Beginning with a commercial dry culture in the form of a\r\npowder as generally used in the creamery or the cheese factory as well\r\nas for the preparation of commercial buttermilk, or with buttermilk\r\ntablets as used in the ordinary household or the hospital, such culture\r\nis added to a small quantity of thoroughly pasteurized milk. If fresh,\r\nsweet skim milk is available it is preferable to whole milk as the\r\nbutter-fat in the latter only interferes with the process; but either\r\ncan be used.\r\n\r\nMilk for starters should be strongly pasteurized by being kept at a\r\ntemperature near the boiling point—at least 180°—for 40 to 60 minutes,\r\nthen cooled to the degree at which it is to be set, usually between 65°\r\nand 75°, somewhat higher for the first propagation with the pure culture\r\nthan for the subsequent transplantings when the bacteria, more or less\r\ndormant in the dry powder or tablets, have attained full vitality. Some\r\nspecies of bacteria, as the Bacillus Bulgaricus, require higher\r\ntemperatures—90° to 100° or even 110°—than others. The culture having\r\nbeen thoroughly incorporated in the milk by vigorous and repeated\r\nstirring or shaking, the milk is left at rest in an incubator or a\r\nwaterbath or wrapped in paper or cloth in a warm room where an even\r\ntemperature can be maintained, until it is curdled, which may take 18 to\r\n24 hours or even longer for the first propagation.\r\n\r\nOne part of this curdled milk is now added to 5 or 10 parts of fresh\r\npasteurized milk and set to ripen in the same way as described above,\r\npossibly at a little lower temperature, and this is repeated every day,\r\nthus maintaining the “Mother Starter.” After the second or third\r\npropagation the bulk of each batch is used as a starter in the larger\r\nlot of material to be ripened, be it cream for butter or milk for cheese\r\nor for commercial buttermilk, while a little is taken for maintenance of\r\nthe mother starter as described above.\r\n\r\nThe _amount of starter_ to prepare every day depends upon the amount of\r\nmilk or cream to be ripened and the per cent of starter used in same.\r\nFor instance, if you have ten gallons of cream to ripen every day in\r\nwhich you wish to use about 10% or 12% starter, or one gallon, take a\r\nlittle less than one pint of the first or second propagation for one\r\ngallon of milk; the next day use one pint of this to add to a gallon of\r\nfresh starter milk, and the remaining gallon to add to the ten gallons\r\nof cream, and so on every day.\r\n\r\nIf you have 4,000 lbs. of milk in the cheese vat to ripen with 2% or 80\r\nlbs. starter, prepare 88 lbs. of mother starter. If, on the other hand,\r\nyou wish to make only a quart of buttermilk every day, take, say, two\r\nbuttermilk tablets, crush them thoroughly in a spoonful of pasteurized\r\nmilk and stir this into a tumblerful of the same milk; let stand till it\r\nis thickened the next day and use a tablespoonful of this thickened milk\r\nin a quart of fresh pasteurized milk which when ripened is your\r\nbuttermilk, from which you take out a tablespoonful for starter in the\r\nnext batch, and so on. In this case there is no “mother starter” except\r\nthat perhaps the first tumblerful prepared with the tablets may be\r\ncalled so, but afterwards the starter is taken right out of the finished\r\nproduct every day.\r\n\r\nThe process may be modified to suit special purposes and local\r\nconditions, but the following precautions should be strictly observed:\r\n(1) to interrupt the ripening immediately by quick and intense cooling\r\nas soon as it has reached the proper point in case the ripened product\r\nis not used at once, and (2) to _keep_ it ice-cold until it is used. If\r\nthis is done, it may be kept for two or three days without deterioration\r\nif it is not convenient to make it fresh every day which, however,\r\nshould be the rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                   MILK SUPPLY AND CREAMERY PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter the composition of cow’s milk and the nature of its\r\nconstituents have been considered, the most important tests for its\r\nrichness and purity have been described, and the ferments have been\r\nmentioned which instigate changes for good or for bad, together with the\r\nmeans at disposal for regulating their activity. To use these means\r\nintelligently in handling milk and its products is the key to the\r\ndairyman’s success.\r\n\r\nWe shall now briefly consider the various steps that are of importance\r\nin modern dairy industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MILK SUPPLY\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the farmer must furnish pure, clean, unadulterated\r\nmilk, fresh from the cow and cooled immediately after milking. His cows\r\nmust be healthy.\r\n\r\n=Bovine Tuberculosis.=—Many milk-cows, for the very reason that they\r\nhave been bred with the one purpose in view of turning all their food\r\ninto milk and wasting as little as possible in building up the body, are\r\nmore or less weak-chested and apt to suffer from tuberculosis. Unless\r\nthis disease is so far advanced as to affect the general health of the\r\ncow, or it has spread to the milk organs, the udder and the teats, it is\r\nnot so dangerous as has heretofore been supposed. It is now held by the\r\ngreat majority of physicians that bovine tuberculosis is hardly ever\r\ntransmitted to grown persons and seldom to children. Neither is it\r\nhereditary. Nevertheless, wherever it is possible to have the herd\r\ntested with tuberculin, segregating, if not killing, the animals which\r\nshow by reaction that they are somewhat tuberculous, it should be done.\r\nMilk from such cows should always be pasteurized.\r\n\r\n=Milk as a Disease Carrier.=—A greater danger lies in the fact that,\r\nwarm as it comes from the cow, milk is an ideal medium for human disease\r\ngerms to grow in, and may thus become a great conveyor of such germs.\r\nFor this reason it is of the greatest importance that the milkers are\r\nhealthy and clean, that the udders and teats be free from dirt, and the\r\nmilk pail covered as far as possible; the barn must be clean, and every\r\nsource of infection excluded. This fact also points to the advisability\r\nof pasteurization. On page 23 a chart is shown, published by the Toronto\r\nBoard of Health and indicating the temperatures at which various germs\r\nof disease are made harmless.\r\n\r\n=Bacterial Count.=—The test for clean milk now mostly used is the\r\n“Bacterial Count,” the number of bacteria—or rather colonies of\r\nbacteria—found in a cubic centimeter of the milk. It would be better if\r\nthe nature or quality of the bacteria could be taken into consideration\r\nas well as the quantity, but that being as yet impracticable, the next\r\nbest thing is to depend upon the number. Ordinary good milk often\r\ncontains hundreds of thousands of bacteria in a cubic centimeter, but\r\nwhere the greatest cleanliness is observed the number may be less than\r\n1,000.\r\n\r\n=Certified Milk= is now sold in many cities which, according to varying\r\ncity ordinances, is guaranteed to have less than 10,000 or 20,000 or\r\n30,000 bacteria, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Counting the bacteria in a cubic centimeter of milk\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cost of producing certified milk places it beyond the reach of the\r\ngreat majority of consumers. But such care and cleanliness as can be\r\nobserved by the farmer and the milkman without extra expense should be\r\ninsisted upon, and milk which nevertheless contains a large number of\r\nbacteria can be made safe by pasteurization.\r\n\r\n=The Sanitary Code.=—The regulation of the production and delivery of\r\nmilk in cities and towns as well as at creameries and cheese factories,\r\nthe “Sanitary Code” established by state and municipal health\r\nauthorities, has been very effective in improving the quality of the\r\nsupply. So enormous have been the improvements in caring for and\r\nhandling the products by the large establishments engaged in the\r\ndelivery of milk as to make the increase in cost seem trifling compared\r\nwith the great benefit to the public health secured by these agencies.\r\n\r\n=New York State Milk Grading.=—The New York State Board of Health\r\nprescribes a grading for milk offered for sale, the most important\r\nfeatures of which are as follows:\r\n\r\n_Certified._—Must be produced under specially sanitary conditions\r\napproved by a county medical commission.\r\n\r\n_Grade A Raw._—Cows must be tuberculin tested and milk must not contain\r\nover 60,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\n_Grade A Pasteurized._—Cows must be subjected to physical examination\r\nand milk must not contain more than 200,000 bacteria before, nor more\r\nthan 30,000 after pasteurization.\r\n\r\nOther grades permitted under the rules, all subject to inspection and\r\napproval of the authorities, are:\r\n\r\n    _Grade B Raw._\r\n    _Grade B Pasteurized._\r\n    _Grade C Raw._\r\n    _Grade C Pasteurized._\r\n\r\nDeliveries must be made within a certain time after production or\r\npasteurization, barns and milk stations are inspected, and altogether\r\nsuch safeguards are employed as to make the supply exceedingly safe and\r\nreliable.\r\n\r\n=City Delivery.=—In villages and small cities the milk supply is still\r\nto a large extent in the hands of farmers who come to town early in the\r\nmorning peddling their milk, often at considerable waste of time for\r\nhorse and man. Or a number of peddlers go over the same route so that it\r\ntakes a dozen wagons to cover a town where three or four could do it.\r\n\r\nAs long as there was no efficient regulation as to price and quality\r\nsuch waste was perhaps unavoidable, as competition on the part of the\r\nproducers and distributors was the only means of protection for the\r\nconsumers. But lately state and municipal control is being exercised to\r\nsuch an extent as to largely eliminate the danger of poor milk and\r\nexorbitant prices. Further development of organized delivery systems so\r\nmuch to be desired for sanitary as well as for economical reasons, may\r\nbe looked for as soon as normal conditions return after the close of the\r\nwar. The delivery of milk is one of the things that in the interest of\r\npublic health must be under the strictest official control, and\r\n_co-operation_ between farmers and consumers is the logical system for\r\nelimination of unnecessary expenses of distribution and for prompt and\r\nsatisfactory service. Their interests are or should be identical and\r\nboth classes are hurt by inefficient and wasteful delivery.\r\n\r\nIn the large cities there has grown up an industry which largely\r\nmonopolizes the milk supply and which until lately was powerful enough\r\nto dictate prices and conditions both for producers and consumers.\r\nSeveral attempts have been made from time to time by farmers to combine\r\nto regulate prices and dictate the terms to the middlemen. Such attempts\r\nhave, however, invariably failed as long as they were built on false\r\neconomic principles and prompted by selfish interests only. No farmers’\r\nassociation can be strong enough to ignore the law of supply and demand,\r\nand it is only quite recently that the _Dairymen’s League_ has succeeded\r\nin influencing the market by taking into consideration the actual cost\r\nof production of milk as worked out by the agricultural colleges, and\r\nfixing the price on a scientific basis. There is one other element\r\nentering into the causes on which the price to the consumers depends,\r\nnamely, _Transportation_, and while municipal boards of health are\r\nlooking after the sanitary conditions and prevention of adulteration,\r\nState and Federal authorities are stepping in as moderators or\r\narbitrators to reconcile the interests of the _Producers_, the _Railroad\r\nCompanies_, the _Distributors_ and the _Consumers_. The next step in the\r\ndevelopment will no doubt be towards full co-operation between producers\r\nand consumers and, to a large extent, elimination of the “middlemen.”\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten, however, that while the much abused\r\nmiddlemen in time past have been able to dictate terms and prices and\r\nhave often abused the privilege; they have at the same time used their\r\ninfluence and power to improve the milk supply. As the supply of oil and\r\ngasoline has been perfected and cheapened by the all-powerful Standard\r\nOil Co. as a monopoly crushing all competition, so the “Milk Trust” has\r\nimproved the distribution of milk and has built up the magnificent\r\nsanitary plants in which milk is handled, pasteurized, bottled and\r\ndistributed in a way that might not have been possible without the\r\nmonopoly. It has served a good purpose, but has at the same time\r\nacquired such power that official control has become necessary for the\r\nprotection of producers and consumers alike, and the time may be near\r\nwhen these two classes will combine and take the matter into their own\r\nhands so that the distribution may be done at actual cost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Milk station in the country where milk is received from the farmers to\r\n    be shipped to the city\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Milk Stations= are plants erected in dairy sections in the country\r\neither by the city milk supply houses or by co-operating farmers, where\r\nthe milk is delivered and handled so as to make it ready for shipment to\r\nthe city. As in the creamery and the cheese factory, the milk is\r\ncarefully examined and, if it is not sweet and pure, it is rejected and\r\nsent back to the farm. Any impure flavor remains in the cover for some\r\ntime and is easily detected by smelling of the cover as soon as it is\r\nremoved from the can.\r\n\r\nA sample is taken and put aside for the Babcock test and perhaps another\r\nfor the Fermentation test. Each farmer’s milk is weighed in the _Weigh\r\nCan_ and run through a cheese-cloth strainer. The further treatment\r\nvaries in different plants. The milk may simply be cooled by running it\r\nover a cold water or brine cooler and placing it in shipping cans in the\r\nrefrigerator or in ice water until the milk-train comes along to pick up\r\nthe cans. Or it may be clarified by running it through a centrifugal\r\nmachine, the same as a separator, in which, however, cream and milk are\r\nnot separated, but impurities are thrown out by the centrifugal force\r\nand deposited on the wall of the bowl, and the purified milk may then be\r\npasteurized and bottled before being shipped to the city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Receiving milk at the milk station\r\n]\r\n\r\nArriving in the city in iced cars the milk is taken to one of the\r\nelaborate plants in which it is pasteurized and bottled, if that has not\r\nbeen done at the country station. The machinery used in these plants is\r\ngetting more and more perfect and expensive and leaves little to be\r\ndesired as to sanitary requirements and economy in handling.\r\nPasteurizers, bottling machines, bottle-washing machines, conveyors,\r\netc., are wonders of ingenuity, and one needs only to see one of these\r\nmodern plants to understand that in a large city milk can only be\r\nhandled to advantage in expensive establishments.\r\n\r\n=Skim Milk= is one of the cheapest of foods and under proper regulations\r\nits sale should not be prohibited. The reason why in times past skim\r\nmilk has been discredited and excluded from sale was that, as produced\r\nby the old methods of raising the cream, before the advent of the\r\nseparator, it was always more or less old and sour before it was\r\navailable and certainly before it could be distributed to consumers.\r\nUnder such conditions it was hardly ever fit for human food. But when\r\nproduced by the separator and pasteurized and cooled immediately\r\nafter—within a few hours after milking, which is entirely feasible—it is\r\nan excellent and nutritious food for adults and even for children over\r\ntwo years of age. Ripened with a pure culture of lactic acid bacteria,\r\nit makes a healthful, refreshing drink, like buttermilk. Only when it is\r\nallowed to sour without proper care or control does skim milk, as whole\r\nmilk does, become unfit for food or drink. On a cold winter morning when\r\nmen are going to work (or perhaps are looking for work which they cannot\r\nfind), and children are on their way to school, often underfed, a\r\nstreet-corner wagon or stand where boiling hot, fresh, sweet skim milk\r\nmight be distributed at a cent or two a glass would be a blessing in any\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pasteurizing and bottling milk in a Borden plant\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CREAM\r\n\r\nWhen new milk is left at rest the cream will rise to the top and after\r\n12 to 24 hours a cream-line can be seen in the bottle. This cream-line\r\nis sharper and more easily seen in raw milk than in pasteurized milk and\r\nits absence is not always a sure sign of lack of richness or purity of\r\nthe milk. By cooling the milk thoroughly so that it will keep, almost\r\nall the cream will be at the top in forty-eight hours and can be skimmed\r\noff. The cream can be used for coffee or on cereals or fruits or\r\npuddings; the skim milk left will still hold ½% or more of butter-fat\r\nand can be used to drink or for cooking.\r\n\r\n=The Separator.=—On the farm or in the creamery the cream is no longer\r\nraised by gravity, that is, by letting the milk “set” either in shallow\r\npans on the kitchen shelf or in deep cans in ice water, but the fresh,\r\nwarm milk is run through the separator in a continuous stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Early conception of the separator\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was noticed that the rising of the cream due to the difference in\r\nspecific gravity between the butter-fat and the milk-“serum” (the watery\r\nsolution of the other constituents) might be greatly hastened by\r\nsubjecting the milk to centrifugal force. This physical phenomenon was\r\ntaken advantage of in the first conception of the separator where it was\r\nshown that if a pail of milk was whirled around like a stone in a sling\r\nthe heavier milk-serum would be thrown towards the bottom of the\r\nseparator pail with so much greater force than the lighter cream\r\n(butter-fat mixed with a small part of the serum) that the separation\r\nwhich would take 48 hours in the milk at rest, could be accomplished in\r\na few minutes when exposed to centrifugal force. From this early crude\r\nattempt the continuous _bowl-separator_ was developed and still later a\r\nnumber of divisions in the bowl were designed which increased the\r\ncapacity and efficiency of the machine wonderfully. The most successful\r\nseparator was designed by Dr. Gustaf De Laval of Sweden and the machines\r\nbearing his name are used all over the world where butter is made. But\r\nthere are many other excellent separators on the market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Gustaf De Laval of Sweden, inventor of the separator bearing his\r\n    name\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the machine the milk is separated instantaneously by centrifugal\r\nforce and runs out through two tubes, one for cream and the other for\r\nskim milk. A small modern hand machine will take care of from 200 to\r\n1,000 lbs. of milk an hour, and power machines are built to separate\r\n6,000 lbs. or more. By regulating the cream-outlet a heavier or lighter\r\ncream can be produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Hand separator\r\n]\r\n\r\nSuppose we are separating some milk containing 4% butter-fat. If ⅛ of\r\nthis milk is separated out as cream and contains all the butter-fat, the\r\ncream will be eight times as rich in butter-fat as the original milk;\r\n32% of the cream will be butter-fat. Such cream is called “32% cream.”\r\nIf we take ¼ as cream, we get a cream four times as rich as the milk, a\r\n“16% cream.” So out of 100 lbs. of milk we can take 12½ lbs. (⅛) of 32%\r\ncream, 25 lbs. (¼) of 16% cream, etc.\r\n\r\nAlthough the skim milk is really valuable as a food, it is worth but\r\nlittle commercially; the cream containing the butter-fat is the\r\nexpensive part of the milk, and we must be prepared to pay for the cream\r\nall that the milk would have cost.\r\n\r\n=Percentage of Butter-Fat.=—The “richness” of cream or milk and their\r\nvalue depend upon the amount of butter-fat in them. So cream or milk is\r\noften called “30% cream” or “20% cream” or “4% milk” according as 30% or\r\n20% or 4% of the fluid is butter-fat; 30% cream is quite rich; ordinary\r\nmarket cream varies between 18% and 40%, though it may fall below 18%,\r\nor it may be sold as a very expensive article as high as 60%. Rich milk\r\nmay contain more than 6% of butter-fat and skim milk less than 0.1 of\r\none per cent. The average for good whole milk is between 3% and 4½%.\r\n\r\nFor a long time scientists and scientific dairymen were the only ones to\r\nspeak of milk and cream in terms of percentage of butter-fat. Now,\r\nhowever, people are beginning to realize how valuable a part of the milk\r\nthe butter-fat is and are paying more attention to the actual percentage\r\nof butter-fat in the cream or milk they use. So it is no longer unusual\r\nto see a dairyman advertise cream of a certain percentage or to hear a\r\nhousewife ask for it specifically.\r\n\r\n=Standardizing Cream.=—For ice cream or for preparing modified milk for\r\nbabies, it is often desirable to dilute rich cream to a certain lower\r\nstandard. The following simple steps can be taken to find out how much\r\nmilk to add for diluting:\r\n\r\n1. From the test—fat-percentage—of the rich cream subtract the test\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n2. From the test desired subtract the test of the milk used for\r\ndiluting.\r\n\r\n3. Divide the first difference by the second, and the result will be the\r\nnumber of pints (or pounds) of milk to be added for each pint (or pound)\r\nof the rich cream.\r\n\r\nFor instance, you may want to thin some 30% cream to 10% for making ice\r\ncream. The milk to be added is skim milk. Then:\r\n\r\n1. 30 - 10 = 20.\r\n\r\n2. 10 - 0 = 10.\r\n\r\n3. 20 divided by 10 = 2. So for each pint of rich cream you may add 2\r\npints of skim milk.\r\n\r\nOr you may wish to thin the 30% cream with whole milk, which has 4%\r\nbutter-fat. Again:\r\n\r\n1. 30 - 10 = 20.\r\n\r\n2. 10 - 4 = 6.\r\n\r\n3. 20 divided by 6 = 3⅓. So you may add 3⅓ pints of the whole milk to\r\neach pint of the 30% cream and still have a 10% cream.\r\n\r\n=Pasteurized Cream= does not look as rich as raw cream, and fresh, sweet\r\ncream appears to be thinner than when it is 24 hours old and slightly\r\nripened. So it is well, when buying cream, not to judge by appearances.\r\nDemand of the milkman that he furnish you cream of a certain percentage\r\nof butter-fat and see to it that you get what you pay for. If you have\r\nno Babcock tester the milk inspector will test the cream for you.\r\n\r\n=Whipped Cream.=—For whipping, cream must be fairly rich, from 24% to\r\n32%, and it must be cold. Fresh, sweet cream does not whip as readily as\r\nthat which has been kept for 12 or 24 hours in ice water. There is no\r\nother secret connected with the process. Use a rich cream, suitably\r\ncooled and aged, and with a good beater there can be no trouble in\r\ngetting a fine, stiff whipped cream. If the cream is too thin or too\r\nwarm it may not become stiff. Sometimes, when it is beaten too long, it\r\nturns into butter and buttermilk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Installation in a Danish creamery.\r\n  From the separator at the right the cream runs through the continuous\r\n    pasteurizer which forces it up over the cooler whence it runs into\r\n    the cream-vat at the left.\r\n  (From Boggild—Maelkeribruget i Danmark)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Emulsified Cream.=—One of the recent additions to the already elaborate\r\nmachinery used in the creamery, the milk supply or the ice cream\r\nbusiness, is the _Emulsifier._ To be sure, emulsifiers were used thirty\r\nto forty years ago to mix animal and vegetable fats—oleomargarine oil,\r\nlard and cottonseed oil—into skim milk for “Filled Cheese” or for\r\nButterine, but lately they are serving new purposes in the milk\r\nindustry. By forcing melted butter-fat or oil mixed with water or skim\r\nmilk through exceedingly small apertures under high pressure, or\r\notherwise breaking up the mixture, an emulsion can be formed in which\r\nthe fat globules are much finer even than those in natural milk or\r\ncream, and separation can be prevented. The force used in these\r\nemulsifiers may be produced by powerful pumps, or a steam jet, or\r\ncentrifugal force under high speed; whichever system is used the\r\nmachines answer the same purpose, to produce a permanent emulsion in\r\nwhich the oil or fat will stay in suspension even after cooling. In some\r\nmilk supply plants and ice cream factories all the cream is emulsified\r\nand the system has especially been applied since the advent of the milk\r\npowder. It is now a not infrequent practice to run the new milk through\r\nthe separator, make sweet, unsalted butter from the cream, and milk\r\npowder from the skim milk, and to ship or store these products\r\nseparately where or until cream is wanted and then bring them together\r\nagain by running them through the emulsifier with a suitable amount of\r\nwater. At first thought this process would seem impractical and\r\nuneconomical. But it has proven good business because in many cases and\r\nplaces skim milk powder and butter keep better separately or can be\r\nshipped at long distance to better advantage than new milk or cream or\r\ncondensed milk. In ice cream factories business may be dull in cold\r\nweather and cream is perhaps not provided and not available, when\r\nsuddenly a hot spell brings orders for large quantities. With a stock of\r\nskim milk powder and butter on hand in the refrigerator, and an\r\nemulsifier to mix these products, cream can be produced on short notice\r\nand there will be no danger of shortage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ICE CREAM\r\n\r\nIce cream has fast become the national dessert served on all festive\r\noccasions, winter and summer. Originally it meant a frozen mixture of\r\nsweetened and flavored milk and cream, but the name has long been\r\napplied to all kinds of frozen delicacies in which cream enters as a\r\nconstituent. Not even there has the line been drawn, but gums, gelatine,\r\ncornstarch, eggs and other “fillers” have been substituted or added to\r\nthicken the mixtures and give “body” to “creams,” which have but little\r\nrelation to the genuine emulsion of butter-fat from cow’s milk.\r\nStandardization has been attempted by National and State food\r\nauthorities with varying success of enforcement. While the application\r\nof the name to a great variety of frozen desserts has no doubt become\r\nlegitimate by long usage it may properly be demanded that as an article\r\nof merchandise “ice cream” shall contain at least 8% to 12% butter-fat\r\nand that no ingredients dangerous to health enter into its manufacture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Hand freezer\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Freezers.=—The freezing is usually done by contact of the material with\r\nmetal cooled on the other side by a “freezing mixture” of salt and ice\r\nwhich produces temperatures far below the freezing point of water while\r\nair is whipped into the cream by the rapid motion of the beater. A great\r\nvariety of excellent freezers of this kind for hand or for power are on\r\nthe market which answer the purpose for making ice cream at home or at\r\nthe ice cream parlor.\r\n\r\nCoarse-grained salt and crushed ice, mixed in the proportion of 1 part\r\nsalt to 4 parts of ice, are constantly filled into the space surrounding\r\nthe ice cream can, and the brine produced by the melting of the mixture\r\nis gradually drawn off from the tub. In a good freezer the operation\r\nshould not take over fifteen minutes. When the cream is frozen to a soft\r\nmush, stop the beater and scrape down the hard particles which may have\r\naccumulated on the sides of the can, add any ingredients which may be\r\nbetter incorporated at this stage than mixed into the original material,\r\nsuch as crushed fruit or preserves, and finish the freezing without\r\ncarrying it too far.\r\n\r\nRemove the beater, stir the cream which should still be soft enough to\r\nhandle, and pack in ice with only a little salt. Or the cream may be\r\ntransferred from the freezer can to the shipping can and packed in it.\r\nIf bricks are wanted the soft cream is packed in molds of the desired\r\nshape and size and buried in the freezing mixture to harden.\r\n\r\nIn modern ice cream factories _Brine Freezers_ are generally used. In a\r\n_Refrigerator Plant_ intensely low temperatures are produced by the\r\nvaporizing of compressed ammonia or carbonic acid in an ice machine, and\r\nbrine circulating in iron pipes is cooled by such medium and may, in\r\nturn, cool the air in the _Cold Storage_ room, or the cream in the\r\nfreezer, or pure water in metal boxes for the manufacture of _Artificial\r\nIce._ It has been attempted to make the brine freezers _continuous_, the\r\ncream mixture being fed into the machine at one end and discharged\r\nfrozen at the other. But this system has not so far been successful, and\r\nintermittent or batch freezers are most practical yet both for hand and\r\nfor power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Power brine freezer\r\n]\r\n\r\nRich material, frozen in a good machine, whether intermittent or\r\ncontinuous, will expand from 50% to 100%, and the original material\r\nshould not fill the freezer can more than half full.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of ice cream has been the subject of study and\r\nexperiments for years in the Dairy Department of the Agricultural\r\nCollege at Ames, Iowa, where Professor M. Mortensen has worked out a\r\ncomprehensive classification from which any manufacturer may readily\r\nchoose his formulas, modifying them to suit his local conditions and\r\nspecial problems. The outline kindly furnished the author by Professor\r\nMortensen is so interesting and instructive as to be well worth copying\r\nsubstantially in full, leaving out the “Ices” in which no milk or cream\r\nis used and which are therefore not of special interest in connection\r\nwith the purpose of this book—the use of more and better milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Ice cream factory\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n           CLASSIFICATION ADOPTED AT IOWA EXPERIMENT STATION\r\n\r\nConsidering the work of former writers as well as names used by business\r\nmen, the following classification was worked out by the station:\r\n\r\n\r\n                           I. Plain Ice Creams.\r\n                          II. Nut Ice Creams.\r\n                         III. Fruit Ice Creams.\r\n                          IV. Bisque Ice Creams.\r\n                           V. Parfaits.\r\n                          VI. Mousses.\r\n                         VII. Puddings.\r\n                        VIII. Aufaits.\r\n                          IX. Lactos.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Explanation and Formulas\r\n\r\nI. _Plain Ice Cream_ is a frozen product made from cream and sugar with\r\nor without a natural flavoring.\r\n\r\nFormulas are given for making ten gallons of finished ice cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vanilla Ice Cream_:\r\n\r\n    5 gallons 25% cream\r\n    8 lbs. sugar\r\n    4 oz. vanilla extract\r\n\r\n_Chocolate Ice Cream_:\r\n\r\n    5 gallons cream\r\n    10 lbs. sugar\r\n    1½ lbs. bitter chocolate\r\n    4 oz. vanilla extract\r\n\r\n_Maple Ice Cream_:\r\n\r\n    5 gallons 25% cream\r\n    6 lbs. cane sugar\r\n    2 lbs. maple sugar\r\n    2 oz. caramel\r\n    4 oz. vanilla extract\r\n\r\n_Caramel Ice Cream_:\r\n\r\n    5 gallons 25% cream\r\n    8 lbs. sugar\r\n    12 oz. caramel\r\n    4 oz. vanilla extract\r\n\r\n_Coffee Ice Cream_:\r\n\r\n    5 gallons 25% cream\r\n    8 lbs. cane sugar\r\n    Extract from 1 lb. coffee\r\n\r\n_Mint Ice Cream_:\r\n\r\n    5 gallons 25% cream\r\n    8 lbs. cane sugar\r\n    1 pt. concentrated Creme de Menthe syrup\r\n    Few drops green coloring.\r\n\r\nII. _Nut Ice Cream_ is a frozen product made from cream and sugar and\r\nsound non-rancid nuts.\r\n\r\n_Walnut Ice Cream_:\r\n\r\n    5 gallons 25% cream\r\n    8 lbs. cane sugar\r\n    4 oz. vanilla extract\r\n    4 lbs. of walnut meats.\r\n\r\nAccording to this general formula the following nut ice creams may be\r\nprepared by substituting different kinds of nut meats:\r\n\r\n  _Chestnut Ice Cream_\r\n  _Filbert Ice Cream_\r\n  _Hazelnut Ice Cream_\r\n  _Pecan Ice Cream_\r\n  _Peanut Ice Cream_\r\n  _Almond Ice Cream_\r\n  _Pistachio Ice Cream_.\r\n\r\nAt times pistachio ice cream is made from oil of pistachio instead of\r\nfrom the nuts. If thus prepared, it will come under the head of plain\r\nice cream.\r\n\r\nIII. _Fruit Ice Cream_ is a frozen product made from cream, sugar and\r\nsound, clean, mature fruits.\r\n\r\n_Strawberry Ice Cream_:\r\n\r\n    5 gallons 25% cream\r\n    8 lbs. sugar\r\n    ½ gallon crushed strawberries.\r\n\r\nEmploying the same formula the following creams may be made by merely\r\nsubstituting other fruits and berries for the strawberries. The amount\r\nof sugar may be varied according to the acidity of the fruit.\r\n\r\n  _Pineapple Ice Cream_\r\n  _Raspberry Ice Cream_\r\n  _Cherry Ice Cream_\r\n  _Peach Ice Cream_\r\n  _Apricot Ice Cream_\r\n  _Currant Ice Cream_\r\n  _Grape Ice Cream_\r\n  _Cranberry Ice Cream_.\r\n\r\nPreparation of _lemon_ and _orange_ ice creams cannot be included under\r\nthis general rule. These creams may be prepared as follows:\r\n\r\n_Lemon Ice Cream_:\r\n\r\n    5 gallons 25% cream\r\n    10 lbs. sugar\r\n    2 pts. lemon juice\r\n    1 pt. orange juice\r\n\r\n_Orange Ice Cream_:\r\n\r\n    5 gallons 25% cream\r\n    10 lbs. sugar\r\n    2 qts. orange juice\r\n    ½ pt. lemon juice.\r\n\r\nIV. _Bisque Ice Cream_ is a frozen product made from cream, sugar and\r\nbread products, marshmallows or other confections, with or without other\r\nnatural flavoring.\r\n\r\n_Macaroon Ice Cream_:\r\n\r\n    5 gallons 25% cream\r\n    8 lbs. sugar\r\n    4 oz. vanilla extract\r\n    5 lbs. ground macaroons.\r\n\r\nFrom this formula we can make:\r\n\r\n    Grape Nut Ice Cream\r\n    Nabisco Ice Cream\r\n    Sponge Cake Ice Cream\r\n    Marshmallow Ice Cream.\r\n\r\nV. _Parfait_ is a frozen product made from cream, sugar and egg yolks\r\nwith or without nuts or fruits and other natural flavoring.\r\n\r\n_Walnut Parfait_:\r\n\r\n    4 gallons 30% cream\r\n    Yolks of 10 dozen eggs\r\n    14 lbs. sugar\r\n    4 oz. vanilla extract\r\n    4 lbs. walnut meats.\r\n\r\nFrom this formula by substituting the nut meats we can make:\r\n\r\n    _Filbert Parfait_\r\n    _Almond Parfait_\r\n    _Peanut Parfait_\r\n    _Hazelnut Parfait_, etc.\r\n\r\nBy substituting the same proportion of fruits as are used for fruit ice\r\ncream, for the vanilla extract and nut meats, fruit parfaits such as\r\nstrawberry, raspberry and cherry parfaits and others may be prepared.\r\n\r\n_Coffee Parfait_:\r\n\r\n    4 gallons 30% cream\r\n    Yolks of 10 dozen eggs\r\n    14 lbs. sugar\r\n    Extract from 1 lb. coffee\r\n\r\n_Maple Parfait_:\r\n\r\n    4 gallons 30% cream\r\n    Yolks of 10 dozen eggs\r\n    4 lbs. maple sugar\r\n    10 lbs. cane sugar\r\n    2 oz. caramel paste\r\n\r\n_Tutti-Frutti_:\r\n\r\n    4 gallons 30% cream\r\n    Yolks of 10 dozen eggs\r\n    14 lbs. cane sugar\r\n    4 oz. vanilla extract\r\n    3 lbs. candied cherries\r\n    3 lbs. candied assorted fruit\r\n    3 lbs. pineapple.\r\n\r\nVI. _Mousse_ is a frozen whipped cream to which sugar and natural\r\nflavoring have been added.\r\n\r\n_Cranberry Mousse_:\r\n\r\n    2 gallons 30% cream\r\n    4 lbs. cane sugar\r\n    1 qt. cranberry juice\r\n    ¼ pt. lemon juice.\r\n\r\nFrom the same formula combinations may be made with various other fruit\r\njuices and natural flavors, such as coffee, vanilla, maple, caramel,\r\npistachio, etc.\r\n\r\n_Sultana roll_, as indicated by the name, is made in a round mold. The\r\ncenter of the mold is filled with tutti-frutti, and the outside with\r\npistachio mousse.\r\n\r\nVII. _Pudding_ is a product made from cream or milk, with sugar, eggs,\r\nnuts and fruits, highly flavored.\r\n\r\n_Nesselrode Pudding_:\r\n\r\n    3 gallons 30% cream\r\n    10 dozen eggs\r\n    10 lbs. cane sugar\r\n    4 oz. vanilla extract\r\n    6 lbs. candied cherries and assorted fruits\r\n    4 lbs. raisins\r\n    4 lbs. macaroons\r\n\r\n_Manhattan Pudding_:\r\n\r\n    3 gallons 30% cream\r\n    10 dozen eggs\r\n    12 lbs. sugar\r\n    2 qts. orange juice\r\n    1 pt. lemon juice\r\n    4 lbs. walnut meats\r\n    4 lbs. pecan meats\r\n    4 lbs. cherries and assorted fruits\r\n\r\n_Plum Pudding_:\r\n\r\n    3 gallons 30% cream\r\n    10 dozen eggs\r\n    10 lbs. sugar\r\n    2½ lbs. chocolate\r\n    4 lbs. cherries and assorted fruits\r\n    2 lbs. raisins\r\n    2 lbs. figs\r\n    1 lb. walnut meats\r\n    3 teaspoonfuls ground cinnamon\r\n    ½ teaspoonful ground cloves.\r\n\r\nVIII. _Aufait_ is a brick cream consisting of layers of one or more\r\nkinds of cream with solid layers of frozen fruits.\r\n\r\nFig aufait may be made from three layers of cream of various flavors\r\nwith two layers of whole or sliced figs. It is most satisfactory to\r\nslice the figs lengthwise in halves.\r\n\r\nOther aufaits may be made from a variety of preserved fruits and berries\r\nand combined with different creams.\r\n\r\nIX. _Lacto_ is a product manufactured from skimmed or whole sour milk,\r\neggs and sugar, with or without natural flavoring.\r\n\r\nFormulas for lactos may be found in Bulletin No. 140 published by the\r\nAmes Station.\r\n\r\nAs an example, the following mixture will make 5 gallons of\r\n\r\n_Cherry Lacto_:\r\n\r\n    3 gallons lacto milk\r\n    9 pounds sugar\r\n    12 eggs\r\n    1 quart of cherry juice or concentrated cherry syrup\r\n    1½ pints lemon juice\r\n\r\n“Lacto Milk” is the same as described under “Commercial Buttermilk” and\r\n“Thick Milk,” pages 81 and 82.\r\n\r\n    The sugar is first dissolved in the lacto milk. The eggs are\r\n    then prepared. The whites and yolks are kept in separate\r\n    containers and each lot is beaten with an egg beater. Both the\r\n    yolks and whites are then added to the milk. The mixture is\r\n    thoroughly stirred and strained through a fine wire gauze. The\r\n    fruit juices are added last. The freezer is now run until it\r\n    turns with difficulty when the paddle is removed. The brine is\r\n    removed and the freezer repacked with ice and salt and left for\r\n    an hour before the contents are served.\r\n\r\n    Orange, Mint, Pineapple, Maraschino, Raspberry or Grape Lacto\r\n    may be prepared by substituting any of these flavors for the\r\n    Cherry.\r\n\r\nX. _Ices_ are frozen products made from water or sweet skimmed or whole\r\nmilk, and sugar, with or without eggs, fruit juices or other natural\r\nflavoring.\r\n\r\nIces may be for convenience divided into _sherbets_, _milk sherbets_,\r\n_frappes_, _punches_ and _souffles_.\r\n\r\n_Milk Sherbet_ is an ice made from sweet skimmed or whole milk with egg\r\nalbumen, sugar and natural flavoring, frozen to the consistency of ice\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n_Pineapple Milk Sherbet_:\r\n\r\n    6 gallons milk\r\n    20 lbs. sugar\r\n    Whites of 2 dozen eggs\r\n    1 gallon pineapple pulp\r\n    1 qt. lemon juice.\r\n\r\nMilk sherbets of various flavors may be prepared according to above\r\nformula by substituting other flavorings.\r\n\r\nThe formulas presented above have been given mainly for the purpose of\r\nmaking clear the difference between the various groups. Numerous other\r\nformulas may be prepared on the same general outline.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProf. Mortensen’s formulas are mostly made out for ten gallons of ice\r\ncream. It is hardly necessary to call attention to the fact that they\r\ncan easily be adapted to any smaller quantities by reducing each of the\r\ningredients alike. For instance, to make:\r\n\r\n_1 gallon of Plain Vanilla Ice Cream_, divide the figures given above by\r\n10 and use:\r\n\r\n    2 quarts 25% cream\r\n    ¾ lbs. sugar\r\n    ½ oz. vanilla extract.\r\n\r\nTo make:\r\n\r\n_1 quart of Strawberry Ice Cream_, divide by 40 and use:\r\n\r\n    1 pint 25% cream\r\n    3 oz. sugar\r\n    Crushed strawberries to taste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Professor Mortensen, behind the vat at the left, giving a lesson in\r\n    the making of ice cream at Ames\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that in the formulas worked out at Ames as above,\r\nvery rich cream is used,—with a fat contents of 25% or 30%,—which makes\r\nexceedingly rich ice creams and great expansion in freezing. The\r\nordinary ice cream maker will usually employ cheaper material, mixing\r\nsome milk in the cream and standardizing the material to suit his local\r\ntrade. Also most housekeepers making ice cream at home will find it\r\nconvenient and economical to use a mixture of milk and cream and in\r\ndoing so one must not expect so much expansion.\r\n\r\nIn many places outside of dairy sections cream is scarce and _condensed\r\nmilk_ is substituted to a large extent. Lately milk powder has come into\r\nuse and _Emulsified Cream_ has become popular. Skim-milk powder and\r\nunsalted butter may be kept in stock and be available at any time, and\r\nby means of an _Emulsifier_ they are united again into a product\r\nidentical with the milk or cream from which they were originally\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\n=Junket Ice Cream.=—By setting a mixture of milk and cream with a\r\nsolution of Junket Tablets and allowing it to jelly before freezing, the\r\nbody of the cream may be improved so that a material of comparatively\r\nlow fat-percentage will make a very good ice cream, rich enough for most\r\npeople and especially well suited for invalids and children. Ice-cold\r\nmilk or cream is rather hard to digest for a weak or delicate stomach\r\nbecause the action of the rennet in the digestive juice is imperfect and\r\nslow except at blood-temperature. In Junket Ice Cream, however, such\r\naction takes place before it is eaten and the digestive ferment of the\r\nstomach is relieved of that function. For that reason Junket Ice Cream\r\nis considered healthier than the ordinary frozen products and may be\r\nindulged in freely by children and invalids.\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of tested Junket Ice Creams:\r\n\r\n                           Vanilla Ice Cream\r\n\r\n    Dissolve two Junket Tablets in a tablespoonful of cold water,\r\n    heat two quarts of milk and one pint of cream lukewarm in which\r\n    has been dissolved one cup of sugar and two teaspoonfuls of\r\n    vanilla flavor, then add the dissolved Junket Tablet, stir\r\n    quickly for one-half minute and pour into ice cream can, let\r\n    stand undisturbed ten or fifteen minutes or until set. Pack with\r\n    ice and salt and freeze.\r\n\r\n                          Pistachio Ice Cream\r\n\r\nExcerpt from an article by Alice Bradley in “Woman’s Home Companion”\r\n\r\n    This is the best ice cream for the money that we know. It may be\r\n    made ready for the freezer early in the morning, and kept in the\r\n    ice box until it is convenient to freeze it. It is quite\r\n    possible to utilize cream that is not perfectly fresh.\r\n\r\n    Put in the can of the freezer one pint of milk, one-half cup of\r\n    heavy cream, one-third cup sugar, one teaspoonful vanilla,\r\n    one-half teaspoon of almond extract, a few grains of salt, and\r\n    vegetable color paste to make a delicate green color. Set the\r\n    freezer in a pan of hot water. As soon as the mixture is\r\n    lukewarm, add one Junket Tablet dissolved in one tablespoon cold\r\n    water. Mix thoroughly and let stand until firm. Put in the ice\r\n    box until ready to freeze, then put can in the freezer tub,\r\n    adjust the crank, put in three small measures of ice that has\r\n    been crushed in a heavy bag or shaved fine with an ice shaver,\r\n    cover this evenly with one measure of rock salt, add three\r\n    measures more of ice and one of salt, let stand five minutes and\r\n    then turn the crank of the freezer for about ten minutes, when\r\n    it may be turned a little more rapidly. Continue the turning\r\n    until the mixture is firm.\r\n\r\n    Remove the dasher, pack ice cream solidly into the can, surround\r\n    with four measures of ice to one of salt, cover with heavy\r\n    burlap bag or newspaper and keep in a cold place until needed.\r\n    Be sure the opening in the side of the freezer tub is not\r\n    plugged up, so that any surplus of salt water will drain off\r\n    instead of getting into the freezer. It may be necessary to\r\n    repack the freezer if the cream is frozen very long in advance\r\n    of the meal. The cream may be put into a mold, set in the\r\n    fireless cooker kettle, surrounded with ice and salt and left in\r\n    the fireless cooker all day.

Then add the cream and vanilla and freeze.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BUTTER\r\n\r\nAs everybody knows, butter is one of the oldest and most important\r\nproducts of the dairy industry and since the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, when science was first applied to it, the art of buttermaking\r\nhas gradually been developed to a high degree of perfection, while the\r\ntaste for fine butter has grown apace with its manufacture.\r\n\r\nBetween 1840 and 1850 the large estates in Holstein, then connected with\r\nDenmark, were known for their fine dairies and excellent butter, made in\r\na practical way without much attention to the reason for the rules that\r\nwere gradually worked out.\r\n\r\nA class of superior dairymaids was educated on these large farms, many\r\nof whom were hired by progressive farmers on the Danish islands where an\r\neffort was made at that time to introduce better methods of dairying.\r\n\r\nThe practical handicraft of these imported expert dairymaids was\r\nsupplemented and regulated by the scientific work of Professor Segelcke\r\nand his pupils and from the Sixties buttermaking became an art in\r\nDenmark which was subjected to the most searching study and\r\nimprovements. Danish butter soon captured the English market where\r\npreviously Isigny (from Northern France) and Dutch butter had commanded\r\nthe highest prices, and Danish sweet butter put up in sealed tin cans\r\nalso became known all over the world as the only butter that would stand\r\nexport to the Tropics.\r\n\r\nIn this country Orange County, N.Y., first produced a high-class article\r\nand, later, Elgin, Ill., became the center that stood for the top of\r\nperfection. Thence the industry soon spread over the middle western\r\nstates, largely populated by Scandinavian immigrants many of whom were\r\nskilled buttermakers, educated in the old countries. Even up to this day\r\nit is noticeable that the list of prize winning buttermakers at the\r\nNational Dairy Shows and other exhibitions is largely made up of\r\nScandinavian names. In Minnesota, for instance, as fine butter is now\r\nmade as anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n_Dairy Butter._—In the early days of the industry butter was made at\r\nhome on the farm. The milk was set in shallow vessels,—in the Holstein\r\nand Danish dairies in wooden tubs 24 inches in diameter placed on the\r\nstone or concrete floor in the milk-vault, a cool cellar partly\r\nunderground,—or in tin pans on the pantry shelf. After 36 to 48 hours\r\nthe cream was skimmed off with a flat scoop, often both cream and skim\r\nmilk being sour.\r\n\r\nAbout 1860 the deep tin can was introduced, set in cold running water\r\nor, where ice was available, in ice water. This was a great improvement\r\nover the shallow setting system. It was now possible to raise most of\r\nthe cream in 24 hours leaving not to exceed ½% butter-fat in the skim\r\nmilk, and to have both cream and skim milk sweet.\r\n\r\n_Centrifugal Creaming._—But the climax of perfection was not reached\r\nuntil the separator (see under Cream) was invented about 1879 and cream\r\nwas raised instantaneously. For a long time it was the object of the\r\nmanufacturers to produce _power separators_ of larger and larger\r\ncapacity, handling from 6,000 to 10,000 lbs. of milk an hour.\r\n\r\n=Co-operative Creameries= were established, taking in 20,000 lbs. of\r\nmilk and more a day. But in thinly settled sections where the roads were\r\npoor it was expensive to haul the milk a long distance to the creamery\r\nand _hand separators_ were introduced, each farmer skimming his own milk\r\nfresh from the cows and delivering the cream, only, to the creamery.\r\nThis system has the advantage of leaving the skim milk on the farm in\r\nthe very best condition for the calves and hogs and of saving time and\r\nexpenses in transportation. It has the disadvantage that many farmers\r\ncan hardly be expected to handle all of these separators as skilfully\r\nand cleanly as the creamery expert can run his one or few machines, and\r\nconsequently that the skimming is more or less imperfect—more butter-fat\r\nbeing left in the skim milk and more impurities in the cream than in the\r\nwhole-milk creamery. But in practice the advantages of the hand\r\nseparator and cream-gathering system seem to be greater than the\r\ndisadvantages and it is rapidly taking the place of the whole-milk\r\ncreameries.\r\n\r\n_Ripening the Cream._—Butter may be made by churning whole milk, but\r\nusually it is made from cream that has been “ripened” or soured by\r\nstanding for about 10 hours at a temperature of from 65° to 75° F.\r\nModern buttermakers often pasteurize the cream and then add a “starter”\r\nto sour it. By preparing the starter with a pure culture of lactic acid\r\nbacteria one can get the desired acidity and aroma, and exclude\r\nundesirable flavors (as to Pure Cultures and Starters, see under\r\n“Bacteria” and “Commercial Buttermilk”).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Sanitary Cream Ripener showing coil swung up into cleaning position\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe process of ripening requires considerable skill and attention and is\r\none of the most delicate functions the buttermaker is called upon to\r\nperform. In the first place the cream must be faultless, sweet and pure\r\nbefore it is set to ripen, so the buttermaker will have full control of\r\nthe fermentation. For, if it is already turned or partly fermented, no\r\nskill will avail to bring it back to perfection. But with a first class,\r\npure cream the operator has it in his power to turn out perfect butter.\r\nIn the big western creameries cream is often collected from farms at a\r\ndistance of a hundred miles or more and in warm weather such cream is\r\nlikely to arrive at the central plant in more or less advanced\r\ncondition. It is therefore difficult for the _centralizers_ to make\r\nreally first-class butter while the “whole-milk creamery” as well as the\r\nfarmer handling his own milk are in position to control the ripening\r\nfrom the beginning,—starting with pure material and being able to\r\ndevelop the desired flavor and acidity in the cream.\r\n\r\nAfter adding the starter to the cream it must be kept at a uniform\r\ntemperature of 65 to 75° during the ripening process and it must be\r\nwatched carefully and occasionally stirred gently until the consistency,\r\naroma and acidity are as desired. Then it should be cooled quickly to\r\nstop further fermentation and if it is not to be churned at once it\r\nshould be kept cold until churning time. Usually it is safer to set the\r\ncream in the morning and hasten the ripening so it will be completed in\r\nthe evening rather than to leave it overnight warm. For, if it is\r\nfinished in the evening, the cream may be cooled and placed in ice water\r\novernight and one is sure to have it in good condition for churning in\r\nthe morning. But it is quite feasible for the experienced operator to\r\nregulate the process so the cream will not be fully ripened in the\r\nmorning until he is on hand to watch it and see that the process does\r\nnot go too far. Taste and smell will tell when it is just right, and the\r\n_acid test_ may also be applied to determine when to stop the\r\nfermentation. An acidity of .5% is usually desired. When the condition\r\nis right, chill the cream, cooling it to below 50°—preferably down\r\ntowards 40°—and leave it in ice water or in the refrigerator until\r\nchurning time; then temper it to the proper temperature for churning.\r\n\r\nEven if it is to be churned soon after the ripening is completed it is\r\nbest to chill it and then raise the temperature to the point wanted for\r\nchurning. This gives a better “grain” and “body” to the butter than if\r\nthe ripened cream is just cooled to the churning temperature, and is\r\nespecially desirable when the cream has been pasteurized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Branch of the Annatto tree\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Coloring.=—When the cream is ready it is poured into the churn and a\r\nlittle butter color is added. Some people prefer butter very light or\r\neven uncolored, but usually 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls of a standard butter\r\ncolor[5] to 10 gallons of cream will be found right, varying according\r\nto the season and the breed of cows furnishing the milk. The butter-fat\r\nin Guernsey and Jersey milk is naturally highly colored, while that in\r\nHolstein milk is comparatively white. When the cows are on fresh pasture\r\nin the early summer the butter-fat is more highly colored than when they\r\nare on dry food. The amount of coloring to be added to the cream is\r\nregulated to overcome such variations and make the butter of uniform\r\ncolor all the year round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Adding the butter color\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Churning.=—Hundreds of varieties of churns have been constructed from\r\ntime to time; 2,000 years ago Pliny described the old dash churn much\r\nthe same as still occasionally used on the farm, and the principle\r\ninvolved in the process has not been changed. The object is to make the\r\nfat globules conglomerate into grains that can be collected and leave as\r\nlittle butter-fat as possible in the buttermilk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Old Arabian churn made out of the skin of a goat\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Ancient churn\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Danish churn\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe best temperature for churning varies from 48° to 56° and must be\r\ndetermined by local conditions and experience. To allow plenty of room\r\nfor the cream to shake about, the churn should not be much more than\r\nhalf full. When the globules of fat suspended in the milk stick together\r\nand form granules as large as good sized pin-heads it is time to stop\r\nthe churn and drain off the buttermilk. If the butter fails to “come” in\r\nhalf an hour or forty minutes it may be because the cream in the churn\r\nis too warm or too cold. A little cold or warm water, as the case may\r\nbe, can be added as a simple remedy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Churning room in a large modern creamery\r\n]\r\n\r\nToward the end of the process care must be taken that the churn is\r\nstopped at the right moment, when the butter will separate clear from\r\nthe buttermilk. After the buttermilk is drawn off pure cold water is\r\npoured into the churn and the butter granules are rinsed in it. This\r\nwater again is drawn off and fresh cold water put in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Butter worker\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Working the Butter.=—The butter can now be taken out with a sieve and\r\nworked on the butter-worker, or it may be worked in the churn. “Working”\r\nthe butter consists in squeezing out the buttermilk and kneading the\r\nbutter into a smooth but not “greasy” mass. If it is too warm and if it\r\nis worked too much, with a sliding motion instead of just pressing, the\r\nbutter is apt to become greasy. If there seems to be any danger of\r\ngreasiness, it is better to stop and put the butter in a cool place for\r\na few hours to recover its elasticity. The working can then be finished\r\nsafely.\r\n\r\n=Salting.=—During this working process salt is added and thoroughly\r\ndistributed and worked in. About half an ounce of salt is used for a\r\npound of butter.\r\n\r\n=Composition of Butter.=—When finished, the butter ought not to contain\r\nmore than 12% to 15% of water, and there should be at least 80% of\r\nbutter-fat. If all the butter-fat originally in the milk could be taken\r\nout in the butter, 100 lbs. of 4% milk should yield 4.88% (4.88 lbs.) of\r\nbutter with 82% butter-fat. But a little is lost in the skim milk and\r\nmore in the buttermilk, which usually contains ½% fat, so that about 4½\r\nlbs. is all the butter that can be expected from 100 lbs. of milk.\r\n\r\n=Overrun.=—Creamery men are much interested in the “Overrun” which means\r\nthe increase from the churn over the amount of fat in the milk. For\r\ninstance, if a quantity of milk containing 100 lbs. butter-fat as shown\r\nby the Babcock Test produces 114 lbs. of finished butter, the overrun is\r\n14%. The buttermaker who gets the largest overrun by reducing the loss\r\nof butter-fat in the skim milk and the buttermilk to a minimum, keeping\r\nthe percentage of water in the butter just below 16%, and yet producing\r\nhigh scoring butter, is considered most efficient.\r\n\r\n=Packing.=—For the market, butter is packed in tubs or stone jars. Or it\r\nis molded in neat one-pound bricks and wrapped in parchment paper.\r\n\r\n=Sweet Butter.=—Real “sweet” butter is churned from fresh, sweet,\r\nunsoured cream. But usually the name is given to the _unsalted_ and\r\n_uncolored_ butter that many people relish. Without the salt it does not\r\nkeep as well as ordinary butter, and must be eaten quite fresh.\r\nWell-made salted butter will keep for months with ordinary care, and in\r\ncold storage it may be kept a year. But when it comes out of cold\r\nstorage it must be used within a few weeks, for butter, like other cold\r\nstorage foods, will soon spoil and become rancid when it is exposed to a\r\nhigher temperature for any length of time.\r\n\r\n=Renovated Butter.=—Butter that has become old and rancid can be\r\n“renovated.” The butter is melted and the butter-oil washed,—aërated in\r\nthe renovating plants,—and then churned with fine-flavored sour skim\r\nmilk. From the sour skim milk it gets back its old butter flavor. The\r\ngranular physical consistency of fresh butter is gained by pouring the\r\nemulsified mixture over cracked ice or into ice water. By the time the\r\nexcess of “buttermilk” has been removed by working, and salt has been\r\nmixed in, the renovated butter may be almost as good as fresh creamery\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n=Oleomargarine= or =Butterine= is made in much the same way. A mixture\r\nof beef-fat (the soft part of beef-tallow) and lard and cottonseed oil\r\nis churned with sour milk and worked and granulated like renovated\r\nbutter. For the better grades, some of the finest creamery butter is\r\nmixed with it, so that the mixture can hardly be distinguished from real\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n=Coco-butter=, =Nut-butter=, etc., in great variety, are now also on the\r\nmarket as substitutes for butter, all prepared in a similar way, but\r\nlacking the vital unknown element that makes genuine butter so superior\r\nto substitutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BUTTERMILK\r\n\r\nIf the cream has been carefully ripened, with or without a pure culture\r\nstarter, and it has shown the proper sourness when churned, the\r\nbuttermilk will be of a pleasing taste and flavor. Its thickness will of\r\ncourse depend upon the amount of water, if any, added to the cream in\r\nthe churn during the buttermaking. If the buttermilk is to be used for\r\nhuman food care must be taken not to dilute it too much.\r\n\r\n=Cooling Essential.=—If buttermilk is left to stand for hours in a warm\r\nroom, fermentation goes on and may soon spoil the buttermilk by making\r\nit sloppy or bitter. It should therefore be cooled at once when drawn\r\nfrom the churn; if kept in ice water it may remain in fine flavor for\r\nseveral days. Well taken care of it is not only a pleasing and\r\nrefreshing drink but eminently healthful. In cooking, too, it can be\r\nused to advantage.\r\n\r\n=Commercial Buttermilk= or =Cultured Milk= is simply carefully soured\r\nmilk. It can be made at home from fresh milk either whole or skimmed or\r\npartly skimmed. Partially skimmed milk containing from 1% to 2%\r\nbutter-fat is plenty rich enough and even better for most purposes than\r\nwhole milk. The essential qualities of good buttermilk depend upon the\r\nproper ripening of the cream or milk, the development of a pure “breed”\r\nof healthful bacteria in a clean field free from weeds. Such a\r\nplantation or “culture” may be grown in milk as well as in cream. Its\r\nfunction is to turn the sugar of milk into lactic acid under the\r\ndevelopment of pleasing flavors and whether the butter-fat is removed by\r\nthe separator or by churning makes little difference. In natural\r\nbuttermilk there is always a little butter-fat—at least ½%—left, mostly\r\nin the form of fine granules, too small to be retained in the butter. If\r\nthe same amount of butter-fat is left in skim milk and that is ripened\r\nand churned, the product will be identically the same as natural\r\nbuttermilk from ripened cream.\r\n\r\n=Ripening.=—For best result the milk should be pasteurized, not\r\nnecessarily as thoroughly as for starters, but sufficiently so as to\r\ndestroy all obnoxious bacteria and give those introduced through a pure\r\nculture starter a chance to grow. Buttermilk may, however, also be made\r\nfrom good, clean, unpasteurized milk of good flavor. Whether pasteurized\r\nor not the milk is set to ripen with from 5 to 10% starter at a\r\ntemperature of from 65 to 75°. The preparation of starters is described\r\nunder “Bacteria” and the ripening of the milk for “buttermilk” is\r\nessentially the same process (see also under _Ripening_ of cream for\r\nbutter). When ripened to the desired acidity,—say .5% to .6% by the acid\r\ntest,—stop further fermentation by thorough cooling.\r\n\r\n=Breaking up the Curd.=—After cooling, the ripened milk may be broken up\r\nfine and if vigorously shaken or “churned” it will remain smooth and\r\ncreamy. Otherwise it may separate into curd and whey. If churned long\r\nenough for the butter to form, it becomes absolutely identical with real\r\nbuttermilk. But, for all practical purposes, a vigorous shaking for a\r\nfew minutes is enough.\r\n\r\n=Thick Milk.=—“Thick Milk” as eaten in Scandinavia is made in the same\r\nway as commercial buttermilk, except that the milk—rich whole milk—is\r\nset to ripen in the bowl in which it is to be served. Instead of being\r\nchurned or stirred, it is left thick, to be served as a pudding, like\r\nJunket made from sweet milk. The rich layer of cream that forms on top\r\nis excellent. “Thick Milk” is eaten plain with the oatmeal for\r\nbreakfast, or as a dessert with grated stale bread and sugar spread over\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe uses of buttermilk in making pancakes and for many other culinary\r\npurposes are mentioned in the chapter on “Milk Cookery.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Elie Metchnikoff, author of “The Prolongation of Life”\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Yoghourt= or =Bulgarian Sour Milk= is prepared with a culture of\r\nbacteria originally found in Bulgaria where Metchnikoff, the late\r\ndirector of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, found people living to\r\nexceptional old age which he ascribed to the fact that their principal\r\ndiet is sour milk of very high acidity.\r\n\r\nThe theory is that a luxurious growth of lactic acid bacilli, acting as\r\na germicide, destroys other fermentations in the lower intestines. The\r\nbacilli active in Yoghourt require a somewhat higher temperature for\r\ntheir best growth than the lactic acid bacilli predominant in sour cream\r\nfor the finest butter, a fact which must be taken into consideration in\r\npreparing the various products.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FERMENTED MILK\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of Koumis, Kefir and other fermented milks of the\r\nsame class, Yeast plays an important part, changing some of the\r\nmilk-sugar into the alcohol which is found in these preparations in\r\nquantities up to 2%.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Baba Vasilka, 126 years old and her son, Tudor, 101;\r\n  Bulgarian peasants whose principal food has been sour milk all their\r\n    lives\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Koumis= was first made from mare’s milk by the Tartars, but is now\r\nprepared in this country from cow’s milk by the addition of sugar and\r\nyeast. As carbonic acid is developed in the process it is quite\r\neffervescent and may be regarded both as a food and a stimulant. It is\r\nsometimes prescribed by physicians in cases when the patient cannot\r\nretain other food.\r\n\r\n=Kefir= is a similar preparation originally made in the Caucasus by a\r\nfermentation started by Kefir grains which contain both yeast and\r\nvarious bacteria. The dry Kefir grains are soaked, first in lukewarm\r\nwater, later in lukewarm milk, for several days, until they develop so\r\nmuch gas as to float on the top. A couple of tablespoonfuls of the\r\ngrains are then added to a quart of milk which is left to ferment at 70°\r\nF. under frequent stirring or shaking. When the fermentation is fully\r\ndeveloped the grains are strained off and the milk is bottled and kept\r\nfor 1 to 2 days at 60°. The grains may be used at once again in fresh\r\nmilk, and when the manufacture is finished they may be dried and kept,\r\nto be used again another time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Kefir grains of natural size; a, b and c dried; d, e and f soaked\r\n    (Orla Jensen, Milk Bacteriology)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                                 CHEESE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Students making cheese in the University cheese factory, Madison, Wis.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMost of the following pages on _Cheese_ were published in 1918 as a\r\nseparate pamphlet to meet an urgent demand for brief directions along\r\nthis line during the Food Conservation campaign. The copy has, however,\r\nbeen revised and new material has been added with the view of making\r\nthis chapter more useful to those who desire to study in detail the\r\nmanufacture of various fancy foreign types of cheese such as Edam,\r\nSwiss, Brick, Roquefort, etc., which are now made in this country in\r\nconstantly increasing quantities.\r\n\r\nFor more complete directions in cheese making students are referred to\r\n“A B C in Cheese Making” by J. H. Monrad, and other technical works.\r\n\r\nCheese of a thousand different kinds is made, varying in properties and\r\nappearance from the solid, yet mellow and agreeable Cheddar cheese to\r\nthe semi-soft, malodorous Limburger, the delicious, soft Neufchatel and\r\nCream cheese, or the sweet Myseost of Norway. In India cheese was made\r\ncenturies ago; to-day it is produced the world over, in the caves of the\r\nSwiss Alps and in the most modern and scientific American cheese\r\nfactories and laboratories. Of these myriad types we can here describe\r\nonly a few.\r\n\r\nCheese may be classified into that made with rennet and that made\r\nwithout. Of cheese made with rennet some is what is called hard, some\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\nThe English and American _Cheddar_—the common _American cheese_—the\r\n_Dutch Gouda_ and _Edam_, the Swiss _Gruyere_, and the Italian\r\n_Parmesan_ are all hard cheese made with rennet. As examples of the soft\r\nvarieties may be mentioned the French _Camembert_ and _Brie_, _Cream_\r\nand _Neufchatel_ cheese. In a class by themselves are such cheeses as\r\nthe French _Roquefort_, the English _Stilton_, and the Italian\r\n_Gorgonzola_, their peculiar flavors being derived from molds implanted\r\nin the curd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen cheese is made without rennet, the milk is allowed to curdle by\r\nnatural acidity or it is in some other way made acid. Among the\r\nvarieties made by this method the common _Cottage_ cheese is the best\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nFor many years imitations of foreign varieties such as Swiss and\r\nLimburger have been made in Northern New York and Wisconsin. As a result\r\nof the war and the cutting off of foreign cheese imports, the State of\r\nWisconsin has built up a large business in these fancy varieties. New\r\ntypes have lately been added, as the _Romano_, _Riggiano_, and\r\n_Myzethra_, which are of Italian and Greek origin. Some of these are\r\nmade of whole milk, some of partly-skimmed milk, and others of the\r\nalbumin of the whey.\r\n\r\nLet us briefly review the characteristic features in the making of the\r\nolder types.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHEDDAR CHEESE\r\n\r\nFor a hundred years or more this famous cheese has been made and\r\nmarketed at the village of Cheddar near Bristol, England.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the nineteenth century a farmer in that neighborhood,\r\nJoseph Harding of Marksbury Vale, systematized the manufacture and it\r\nwas his method that became the model for cheesemaking in America. In\r\nthis country it was first made in Herkimer County, N.Y., where Harry\r\nBurrell not only made cheese for the home market, but also exported to\r\nEngland, and his son, David H. Burrell, at Little Falls later developed\r\nthe machinery which became the standard for the American and Canadian\r\ncheese factories.\r\n\r\nThe factory system by which cheese was made from milk brought together\r\nfrom several farms, originated near Rome, N.Y., and soon cheesemaking\r\nbecame an important industry throughout Central and Northern New York\r\nwhence it spread into Pennsylvania, Ohio and the West, as well as to\r\nCanada. To-day Wisconsin makes more cheese than all the other states\r\ntogether and Canada largely supplies England with Cheddar cheese of\r\nexcellent quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Joseph Harding, who systematized the making of Cheddar cheese in\r\n    England\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  David H. Burrell,\r\n  who introduced laborsaving machinery and supplies in the cheese\r\n    factories\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Jesse Williams, father of the American factory system\r\n]\r\n\r\n                          _The Factory System_\r\n\r\nThe milk is delivered in the morning by the farmers at the factory and\r\nis weighed and strained through cheese-cloth into the cheese vat. When\r\nit is all in the vat it is warmed to a temperature of 86° F. by letting\r\nsteam into the water surrounding the bottom and sides of the jacketed\r\nvat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A measuring glass and an accurate thermometer are indispensable\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Marschall rennet test\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Ripening.=—The milk should be slightly acid, not noticeably sour, yet\r\nsufficiently ripened for the proper fermentation to take place in the\r\nprocess that follows. The best cheesemakers regulate the ripening by\r\nadding a starter to the sweet milk and allowing the lactic acid bacteria\r\nto multiply in the milk until a _Rennet Test_[6] or _Acid Test_[7] shows\r\nthat the desired degree of acidity has been reached. The starter may be\r\nsour whey or preferably prepared from sweet skim milk or whole milk with\r\na commercial lactic acid culture as described in Chapter I under\r\n_Ferments_ and _Buttermilk_. From 1% to 2% starter is usually\r\nsufficient. An acidity of .18% to .20% or 2½ degrees on the Rennet Test\r\nis usually desired before the rennet is added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Christian D. A. Hansen, inventor of commercial rennet extract\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Blowing up the rennets to dry them\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Adding Color and Rennet.=[8]—If the cheese is to be colored, from 1 to\r\n2 ounces of liquid cheese color (Annatto dissolved in an alkali) per\r\n1,000 lbs. of milk is now added and thoroughly mixed into the milk which\r\nis then set with rennet. Three ounces of a standard rennet extract to\r\n1,000 lbs. of milk is usually sufficient. Enough should be used so that\r\nthe milk will show beginning coagulation in 10 to 15 minutes and be\r\nready to cut in 30 to 40 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe extract should be diluted with ten times as much water and is then\r\npoured into the milk under vigorous stirring so as to be thoroughly\r\ndistributed and incorporated in the whole mass.\r\n\r\nOwing to the scarcity of the raw material for rennet extract during the\r\nwar, pepsin extracted from hogs’ stomachs has been substituted in many\r\nfactories and is used either in dry form or as a liquid extract instead\r\nof rennet extract.\r\n\r\nWith pepsin as the coagulant it is necessary to ripen the milk somewhat\r\nfurther than if rennet is used, in fact to the danger-point where a\r\nlittle more acidity is apt to do harm and produce a dry and crumbly\r\ncheese and loss of butter-fat in the whey. Most cheesemakers therefore\r\nprefer rennet when they can get it.\r\n\r\nThe rennet having been added, the milk is left undisturbed until a firm\r\ncurd has been formed. When the curd breaks or splits sharply before the\r\nfinger pushed slowly through it, it is ready to be “cut.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Curd knives\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Cutting.=—Two sets of curd knives are used, each consisting of a metal\r\nframe in which tinned steel blades are hung, in one vertically and in\r\nthe other horizontally. The vertical knife is first carried slowly\r\nthrough the curd lengthwise and crosswise; the horizontal set of blades\r\nis then moved carefully through the length of the vat. When the cutting\r\nis over, the entire mass should be in cubes about half an inch square.\r\n\r\nThe whey that begins to separate out should be clear and yellow. Milky\r\nwhey is a sign that the butter-fat is escaping in it; the curd has been\r\nbroken up too violently. In curdling, the casein encases the butter-fat\r\nand the object of the breaking up of the curd in the vat is to expel the\r\nwhey but retain the fat in the cheese.\r\n\r\n=“Cooking” the Curd.=—Gentle heat is now applied to raise the\r\ntemperature gradually to 98° or 100° in the course of about 30 minutes.\r\nMeanwhile the small pieces of curd are kept floating in the whey by\r\ngentle stirring with a rake and the hands, and are not allowed to pack\r\nat the bottom of the vat. The heating is easily regulated by opening the\r\nsteam valve little by little. Through the “cooking” the pieces of curd\r\nshrink to some extent and are hardened so that they will gradually stand\r\nlivelier stirring without losing butter-fat. After the cooking the curd\r\nis left for an hour or so in the whey for a slight acidity to develop\r\nand it is then shoved toward the sides of the vat and the whey is\r\ndrained off. Here again the “Acid Test” may assist in determining when\r\nthe whey should be drawn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Cutting the curd\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Cheddaring or Matting.=—After thorough draining, the curd is packed\r\ntogether in the bottom of the vat or on a “sink” provided with a false\r\nbottom covered with cheese-cloth. After fermenting for 10 or 15 minutes\r\nit is cut into large pieces which are again packed together for further\r\nmatting. The exact condition to be attained can be determined only by\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “Cheddaring” or “Matting” the curd\r\n]\r\n\r\nA simple test, the “Hot Iron Test,” may, however, help the cheesemaker\r\nto judge of this point. A handful of curd squeezed together and touched\r\nto a hot steam pipe or an iron rod heated almost red-hot in the fire\r\nunder the boiler, and slowly withdrawn, will leave threads sticking to\r\nthe iron. Depending upon the maturity of the curd, the threads will\r\nbreak at a length of from ½ to 2 inches. Usually fermentation is\r\nconsidered sufficient when threads 1½ inches long are formed by this\r\ntest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Curd mill\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Salting.=—The matting is then interrupted by breaking up and salting\r\nthe curd. This can be done by hand or by a curd-mill which cuts or\r\nbreaks up the curd and permits a thorough mixing in of the salt. Two or\r\nthree pounds of salt to one hundred pounds of curd, or the curd from\r\n1,000 lbs. of milk, is the usual ratio.\r\n\r\n=Pressing.=—Stirring and cooling the salted curd to about 80° F. makes\r\nit ready for packing into the hoops in which it is to be pressed. The\r\nhoop is usually a cylinder of heavy tin with a “follower” of wood on\r\nwhich the pressure is applied. Before the curd is put in, the hoop is\r\nlined with cheese-cloth which remains on the cheese, when it is taken\r\nout. The press mostly used in the factory is the continuous pressure\r\n“gang-press” in which a number of cheeses can be pressed at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n=Curing.=—After 18 hours’ pressure the cheese is taken out of the press\r\nand out of the hoop, weighed and placed on a shelf or table in the\r\ncuring room. For the first week or ten days it is kept at a temperature\r\nof about 70°, later the cheese is removed to a cooler room and possibly\r\nplaced in cold storage. Usually it is paraffined to prevent too much\r\ndrying and cracking of the rind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Filling the curd into the hoops\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo cure a first-class Cheddar cheese takes from three to six months, but\r\nmost of the American cheese is made to cure much more quickly and is\r\neaten two to four months old. Indeed, it is generally shipped from the\r\nfactory eight to ten days old and whatever further curing it gets is in\r\nthe warehouse of the commissionman or in the grocery store.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Gang press\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Form, Size and Packing.=—The old style American cheese is cylindrical,\r\nabout 14 inches in diameter, and varying in depth to weigh between 60\r\nand 80 pounds. Various other forms are now often made, square and long\r\nor in fancy shapes, such as a ball or a pineapple. Aside from such\r\nfreaks, which have never become very popular, other deviations from the\r\nlarge, standard, American Cheddar, are also made to a considerable\r\nextent. People who have visited the beautiful National Dairy Shows held\r\nin turn in Chicago, Springfield, Mass., and Columbus, O., the National\r\nMilk and Dairy Farm Expositions of New York City, the Ontario Provincial\r\nFair held each year at Toronto, or the annual State Fairs in New York,\r\nWisconsin, Michigan and other cheesemaking sections will have in mind\r\nfirst the prominent exhibits of the regular Cheddar, showing a\r\nuniformity in texture, form and taste that is really remarkable. But one\r\nwill also admire the variety of other forms. There are the _Flats_ or\r\n_Twins_, packed two in a box and weighing together the same as one\r\n_American_; the _Young Americas_ packed four in a box; the _Longhorns_\r\nof six to eight inches in diameter; others made like a loaf of bread and\r\ncreased so that a pound or two may be cut off fairly accurately, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Taking the cheese out of the press\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe _Giant Cheeses_, weighing five to six tons, occasionally exhibited\r\nand cut up at World Fairs and on similar occasions are, like the\r\npineapple cheese, a curiosity rather than an industrial product.\r\n\r\nOne of the best forms, in the writer’s opinion, is the small 5-lb.\r\ncheese, proportioned exactly like the large American. This makes a\r\nsuitable size for an average family, the members of which have learned\r\nto appreciate a good cheese. If it is made smaller, too much is lost in\r\nthe rind; if larger it gets too old before it can be consumed by one\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Curing room\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe larger cheeses are usually packed in neat, snug-fitting elm-wood\r\nboxes, with thin “Scale Boards” on the top and bottom of the cheese, the\r\nsmaller ones in paraffined pressed pulp or pasteboard boxes.\r\n\r\n=Cleaning the Vats and Utensils.=—Like every other place where milk and\r\nits products are handled, the cheese factory must be kept scrupulously\r\nclean. Vats and utensils should be rinsed first with cold or lukewarm\r\nwater or whey, then scrubbed with boiling hot water and if necessary\r\nwith soda, soap, or washing powder. The surroundings should be kept neat\r\nand attractive, and the cheesemaker must see that the transportation\r\ncans are kept clean by the farmers and the milk delivered in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Cheese box\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Yield.=—The yield is around 10% of the milk. To make a pound of fresh\r\ncheese takes from nine to eleven pounds of milk. In curing, a part of\r\nthe weight is lost by evaporation, but this loss is reduced to a minimum\r\nby paraffining.\r\n\r\nIn some localities an increased yield is obtained by washing the curd\r\nand making it absorb all the water it can hold. The process is not\r\ncommendable and while it may sell to some extent, in certain markets\r\nwhere a soft, fresh cheese is liked, “washed” or “soaked” curd cheese\r\ncan never compare favorably in quality with a well-made, firm Cheddar\r\ncheese that is mellowed down by long-time curing to a consistency so it\r\nwill fairly melt in your mouth.\r\n\r\n=Composition.=—The American cheese contains almost all the casein and\r\nthe butter-fat of the milk, besides such portions of the milk-albumin,\r\nmilk-sugar, and mineral matter as are held in the water or whey which is\r\nretained in the cheese. In round figures average American cheese\r\ncontains equal parts of casein, butter-fat and water, 30 to 35% of each.\r\nIn order to protect the honest maker and the consumer and prevent\r\n“soaking” of the curd to an extent that may be considered fraudulent,\r\nthe dairy laws of the State of New York limit the contents of water\r\npermissible to 40% and 42% respectively for certain classes of cheese.\r\n\r\n=Qualities.=—A good Cheddar cheese should be mellow, yet solid, without\r\nholes, and of an agreeable taste, neither sharp nor bitter. Cheese can\r\nbe made of skim milk, but it is hardly palatable. In the fall of the\r\nyear, when the average milk is rich in butter-fat, 1% or 2% butter-fat\r\nmay be taken from the milk and the resulting partly-skimmed milk will\r\nstill make a fairly good cheese, hardly distinguishable from full cream\r\ncheese. Under the laws of the State of New York it must, however, be\r\nmarked “Skim Milk Cheese.”\r\n\r\n                   Cheese Made from Pasteurized Milk\r\n\r\nFrom time to time attempts have been made to make Cheddar cheese from\r\npasteurized milk. If the milk is heated to 145° only, and held for 30\r\nminutes at such temperature, its property to form a firm curd with\r\nrennet is not destroyed and it will make a fine cheese, but if it is\r\npasteurized at a higher temperature it will not curdle firmly until it\r\nis ripened or otherwise brought back to the condition required for\r\nsatisfactory action of the rennet ferment. Thorough ripening with a pure\r\nculture starter will do it, or an addition of muriatic acid will\r\naccomplish the same in a shorter time, but care must be taken not to use\r\ntoo much, which would make the cheese dry and crumbly. Dr. J. L. Sammis\r\nand A. T. Bruhn of the Wisconsin Dairy School worked out the problem and\r\nsystematized a process which is described in Bulletin 165 of the U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture and by which it is claimed a first-class\r\ncheese can be made regularly from thoroughly pasteurized milk.\r\n\r\n                   Making Cheddar Cheese on the Farm\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  American outfit for farm cheese making\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Plain wooden vat and curd mill\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt takes quite a little experience to make a good Cheddar cheese and,\r\nunless one has the time and opportunity to study it and make it an\r\nevery-day practice, it is not as a rule advisable to attempt making\r\nCheddar cheese in the home from the milk of one or a few cows.\r\n\r\nThe amateur will usually find it easier to make Neufchatel or Cream or\r\nCottage cheese for home use or for the home market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Danish kettle and cheese vat\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf Cheddar cheese is to be made regularly it is best to get an outfit\r\nconsisting of a small boiler and a jacketed vat, although cheese may be\r\nmade in a plain wooden tub or any other convenient vessel. The double\r\nbottomed vat generally used in American as well as in Danish dairies\r\nfacilitates both the heating of the milk before setting and the\r\n“cooking” of the curd in the whey after cutting. Either low pressure\r\nsteam, or—better—water heated by steam, is introduced in the space\r\nbetween the outer, wooden bottom and the inner, tinned steel or copper\r\nbottom. If it is cool the milk should be warmed to 86° F. In the summer\r\nit may be warm enough as it comes in, fresh from the cow. If not, heat\r\nit by steam or by setting it in a “shot-gun” can in another vessel of\r\nhot water, stirring frequently, until the thermometer shows 86°. It may\r\nbe well to add a little buttermilk or sour whey from the preceding day,\r\nor a pure culture starter made with Buttermilk Tablets, not to exceed 1%\r\nor 2%.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Cutting the curd\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to make colored cheese add a teaspoonful of liquid\r\ncheese color, or ½ cheese color tablet dissolved in warm water, to 100\r\npounds of milk, more or less according to season and the shade of color\r\ndesired in the cheese.\r\n\r\nNext add the rennet. Where cheese is made from less than 500 lbs. of\r\nmilk Rennet Tablets are handy, one tablet to 80 or 100 lbs. For less\r\nthan 50 lbs. of milk, Junket Tablets may be used, one to a gallon.\r\nDissolve the tablet, or tablets, or fraction of a tablet, as the case\r\nmay be, in _cold_ water and stir the solution well into the milk, making\r\nsure of thorough mixing. Let stand covered for half an hour until a firm\r\ncurd is formed. Cut or break the curd very carefully with a big knife or\r\nspoon or home-made fork with wires across the prongs, imitating as far\r\nas possible the operation with curd knives in the factory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Taking the temperature of the milk in a shot-gun can\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Curd fork\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mold or “Hoop”\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Cook” the curd as in factory cheesemaking. If steam is not available,\r\nallow the curd to settle and dip off some of the whey which is then\r\nheated and poured back on the curd so as to raise the temperature of the\r\nwhole mass about 2 degrees. Repeat this several times, gradually raising\r\nthe temperature to 100°, a few degrees at a time.\r\n\r\nKeep the curd gently stirred up and floating in the whey and do not\r\nallow it to lie on the bottom of the vat long enough to pack firmly\r\ntogether, stirring once in a while until by smell and taste (if not also\r\nby acid or hot iron tests) it appears to be sufficiently fermented for\r\nthe whey to be drawn, a condition that can only be learned by\r\nexperience. This will be about two or three hours from the time the\r\nrennet is added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Diagram of lever press\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Combined screw and lever press\r\n]\r\n\r\nDraw the whey and press more out of the curd with the hands. Let the\r\ncurd mat and break it up alternately several times; finally crumble and\r\npulverize it and keep it stirred with the hands, adding salt at the rate\r\nof three to four ounces to the curd from 100 lbs. of milk and continuing\r\nthe stirring until the curd is cooled down to below 80°, when it should\r\nbe packed into the hoop and put to press. This salting and cooling may\r\ntake another hour. The hoop may be made of wood or heavy tin of any size\r\ndesired, with a loose follower of wood. The sides and bottom should be\r\nperforated to allow the whey to escape. Or it may be a cylinder without\r\ntop or bottom, placed on a corrugated piece of board. Line the hoop with\r\ncheese-cloth before putting in the curd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Upright factory and dairy cheese press\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor pressing, a home-made lever-press, as outlined in the diagram, may\r\nbe made of a plank or bar, one end of which (_C_), is stuck under a\r\npiece of a board nailed on the wall while at the other end a weight\r\n(_K_) is applied which may be moved in and out to regulate the pressure.\r\nThe hoop is placed under the plank at the fulcrum (_K__{1}) near the\r\nwall. If a compound lever-press or a screw-press is available it is\r\nbetter. It is important that the pressure is applied straight so as to\r\nmake the cheese even and not one side lower than the other. Begin with\r\nlight pressure and increase it gradually every hour until at night the\r\nfull pressure is applied. After an hour take the cheese out and turn it\r\nin the hoop, then return it to the press and at night apply full\r\npressure. The next morning take it out and weigh it and place it on the\r\nshelf to cure in a room of moderate temperature, turning it every day.\r\nAfter a couple of weeks it may be removed to a cool cellar and rubbed\r\nwith grease. In two to three months it should be sufficiently matured\r\nfor consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n              OTHER TYPES OF HARD CHEESE MADE WITH RENNET\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A variety of domestic and foreign cheese made at the dairy school of\r\n    the University of Wisconsin\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of the Dutch Gouda, the Danish Export, and other\r\nsimilar types, the “cooking” and matting of the curd, characteristic of\r\nthe English and American Cheddar, are more or less omitted. Otherwise\r\nthe process and the result are not greatly different. They are all\r\n“hard” or solid cheese of the same class, though there are hundreds of\r\nvarieties in different localities, each with some peculiarity of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Gouda cheese\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Gouda Cheese.=—The _Gouda_, like the _Danish Export_ cheese, is made\r\nfrom whole or partly-skimmed milk which is set with rennet at 90° F. and\r\nis coagulated, ready for cutting, in fifteen to twenty minutes. The curd\r\nis broken with the “lyre,” so called, a frame on which piano wires are\r\nsuspended. The curd is but slightly “cooked” and the whey is drawn while\r\nstill sweet. After being pressed with the hands in the vat to squeeze\r\nout the whey the curd, still quite warm, is put into wooden molds and\r\nworked and squeezed in them with the hands for half an hour to eliminate\r\nmore whey, when the mold is placed in a regular press for 12 to 18\r\nhours. To salt it the cheese is placed in a strong brine where it\r\nremains for several days. It is then put on the shelf in the curing room\r\nwhere it is turned and rubbed daily and in four to six weeks it is\r\nmarketed. The cheese is about 10 inches in diameter by 4 to 5 inches\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Lyre\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Edam Cheese.=—The ball-shaped red _Edam_ is also made in Holland by a\r\nsimilar method to that of the Gouda.\r\n\r\nFresh milk is set at from 90° to 93° F. in summer and up to 97° in\r\nwinter,—colored to a rather high yellow with Annatto. Add sufficient\r\nrennet to coagulate the milk in 8 to 15 minutes. Cut curd carefully with\r\nthe “lyre” and break with fork into very fine pieces, as small peas.\r\nLeave to settle for 3 to 4 minutes, putting cover on the vat if the\r\ntemperature in the room is below 60°. When settled, the curd is gently\r\npushed into a heap which takes 5 to 6 minutes and the whey is removed\r\nwith a dipper. Weight is applied for 5 minutes and the tub or vat is\r\ntipped so the whey will drain off while the curd is held back with the\r\ndipper. This pressing is repeated twice more for 4 and 3 minutes\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Curing room in a Gouda cheese factory\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe curd should now be elastic and firm and show a temperature, in\r\nwinter of at least 83°, in summer at most 90°. If necessary the\r\ntemperature is regulated by pouring hot whey (not exceeding 104°) or\r\ncold water over the curd.\r\n\r\nThe mold is then placed in the vat and two handfuls of curd put in which\r\nis squeezed and worked thoroughly with the hands. More curd is added and\r\nworked in the same way and this is repeated until the mold is full with\r\na large top on, which is pressed with the hands for 4 or 5 minutes,\r\nturning the cheese 3 or 4 times and opening the drain holes if plugged\r\nup. Some makers sprinkle a teaspoonful of fine salt in the bottom of the\r\nmold, but in warm weather it is better to work in a quarter of an ounce\r\nof salt. This work must be done quickly so the curd will not cool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mold for Edam cheese\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen thus formed the cheese is dipped for 1 or 2 minutes in fresh whey\r\nheated to 126° (in winter 131°) and pressed with the hands in the mold\r\nfor another 2 minutes when it is carefully wiped off by rolling on a\r\nfine cloth to remove the last drop of whey. The cheese is then wrapped\r\nin a fine cloth, placed in the mold and put to press, in the Spring for\r\n5 to 7 hours, later in the year for 12 hours. The cloth is now removed\r\nand the cheese is put in a larger mold which is placed in a water-tight\r\nsalting box provided with a cover and a drain-hole in one end. The first\r\nday a pinch of salt is put on the top of the cheese and the next the\r\nwhole cheese is rolled in damp salt, turned and put back in the mold, a\r\nliberal quantity of salt being placed on the top. This is repeated every\r\nday until the cheese from being soft and elastic becomes hard which as a\r\nrule takes 8 to 10 days for a 4 lb. and 12 days for a 10-12 lb. cheese.\r\nFinally the cheese is left a few hours in the brine collected in the\r\nbox, washed, wiped and placed on the shelf in the curing room.\r\n\r\nThe curing room should be light and well ventilated, never above 72° nor\r\nbelow 45°. Windows must not be opened to admit dry wind or moist air. If\r\ntoo dry the cheese will crack and if too moist it will be covered with\r\ndeleterious yellowish red fungi. The cheese is turned daily the first\r\nmonth, later every other day or twice a week. When 24 to 30 days old the\r\ncheese is soaked for one hour in water of 68 to 77°, washed with a\r\nbrush, dried for 20 to 40 minutes in the sun and returned to the shelf.\r\nThis is repeated two weeks later and then the cheese is painted with\r\nlinseed oil and left on the shelf until shortly before shipping when it\r\nis scraped with a sharp knife and painted according to the demand of the\r\nparticular market for which it is prepared; yellowish with Annatto for\r\nEngland and Spain, red with Turnsole for other countries. When dry it is\r\nrubbed with a little butter and red color.\r\n\r\n=Swiss Cheese.=—The Swiss Gruyere or Emmenthal also belongs to this\r\nclass. It is characterized by its form and size, being large, round and\r\nflat, weighing 100 to 140 lbs. or more, and by the large holes which are\r\nwanted in Swiss, but not tolerated in American or Dutch cheese. It was\r\nformerly supposed that first-class Swiss cheese could only be made in\r\nthe Alps, but very good imitations have long been made in Northern New\r\nYork and in Wisconsin. Besides in the usual large round form, the same\r\nas the genuine imported Emmenthaler, American Swiss or “Switzer” is also\r\nmade in _blocks_, six inches square and twenty inches long, weighing 25\r\nto 30 lbs.\r\n\r\nUntil lately Swiss cheese has been made in the old-fashioned way, the\r\nfactory and tools being of the simplest description. The milk was heated\r\nin a copper cauldron hanging on a crane, enabling the cheesemaker to\r\nswing it on or off the fireplace. Nowadays the kettle is usually\r\njacketed and heated with steam. The round form is still preferred to the\r\nAmerican cheese vat, however, as it adapts itself better to the peculiar\r\nmethod of handling the curd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Swiss cheese\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe milk is set with rennet at a temperature of 90° F. in summer and 95°\r\nin winter, sufficient rennet being used to make a firm curd in thirty to\r\nforty minutes. But very little color is added. The curd is cut with a\r\nlong, sharp wooden knife, the “cheese sword,” first one way into sheets,\r\nthen, as soon as the cuts stand clear, beginning to expel the whey,\r\ncrossways, into vertical sticks, two inches square.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Scoop\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Cheese sword\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Cutting the curd with the scoop\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Tools for stirring the curd\r\n]\r\n\r\nNo horizontal knife is used, but a few minutes after the last vertical\r\ncutting the curd is further broken by the “scoop,” a wooden spoon or\r\nladle about eight inches long, thirteen inches wide, one and one-half\r\ninches deep, and provided with a short handle. Standing at one side of\r\nthe kettle, the cheesemaker scoops off a layer from the top and, drawing\r\nthe scoop towards himself, drops the pieces of curd close to the side of\r\nthe kettle. This movement is repeated, at first slowly, then faster, and\r\nsoon the whole mass of curd is moving, the pieces cut off going down\r\nalong the side of the kettle and the rest of the sticks sliding upward\r\nalong the other side, to be attacked by the scoop as soon as they come\r\nto the top. All the curd having been cut into square pieces, it is\r\nfurther broken by the stirrer, a stick at the lower end of which a few\r\ncross sticks or wings of brass wire are fixed, the whole mass being kept\r\nin constant motion.\r\n\r\n=Cooking the Curd.=—After breaking up the curd to the size of peas or\r\nbeans, the stirring is discontinued for about ten minutes, when it is\r\nbegun again and the kettle is turned over the fire, or steam is applied,\r\nto heat the curd to 140° under constant stirring which is continued for\r\n45 to 60 minutes after this temperature has been reached. The condition\r\nof the curd is judged by squeezing a handful and noticing its elasticity\r\nand consistency. It is important to stop stirring at the right moment.\r\nMore whey is expelled in making Swiss cheese than for Cheddar cheese.\r\n\r\nThe cooking and agitating having been finished, the mass, which now\r\nconsists of grains the size of wheat, is once more stirred up with such\r\nforce as to make it form a funnel at the center and it is then left at\r\nrest for five to ten minutes.\r\n\r\nThe curd, forming a rather solid cake at the bottom of the kettle, is\r\nnow lifted out without being broken. One end of a large piece of cloth\r\nis folded around a flexible rod. Bending over the kettle the maker takes\r\nhold of both ends of the rod and gathering the other end of the cloth\r\nbetween his teeth, pushes the rod down along the farther side of the\r\nkettle, letting it follow the bottom towards himself until the whole\r\nmass of curd is gathered in the cloth, when it is lifted out of the\r\nkettle and placed in the hoop on the press table. The hoop can be\r\nenlarged or diminished to take care of a varying amount of curd which is\r\nput into it in the same solid cake as formed in the kettle without being\r\nbroken. Pressure is applied, at first, gently, later heavier and after\r\nhalf an hour the cheese is taken out, turned and provided with fresh\r\nbandage, put back into press and left till the next day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  In Swiss cheese making the curd is lifted out of the vat with a strong\r\n    cloth\r\n]\r\n\r\nCuring and Salting.—The cheese is first placed in a curing room above\r\nground and heated in winter. After a few weeks it is removed to the\r\ncellar. Sometimes three to five cheese are piled one on the top of the\r\nother for a few days with a few handfuls of salt between them. The\r\nsalting proper is done by rubbing and brushing dry salt and the brine\r\nformed from same into the cheese,—altogether 4 to 5 lbs. of salt to 100\r\nlbs. of cheese. Every day it is rubbed with a dry rag and the cheese is\r\nturned and salted on the other side until the salt is thoroughly\r\nincorporated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Swiss cheese press\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cheese is cured for at least 100 days in the factory and is usually\r\nstored for another three to six months by the dealer before it is ready\r\nfor the consumer.\r\n\r\n=Roquefort.=—The French _Roquefort_ is inoculated with a mold from stale\r\nbread which spreads through the cheese and produces the peculiar flavor\r\nof this type. It is made from sheep’s milk and was formerly cured in\r\ncool subterranean caverns, but now in elaborate curing houses. In this\r\ncountry imitation Roquefort is made of cow’s milk and cured in cold\r\nstorage.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered, however, that sheep’s milk is very rich in fat\r\nand that a rich Roquefort that will compare favorably with the genuine\r\ncannot be made from cow’s milk without an addition of cream if sheep’s\r\nor goat’s milk is not available. In France a small addition of cow’s\r\nmilk to the sheep’s milk—not to exceed 10%—is often used.\r\n\r\nAround Roquefort a milk ewe produces on an average 135 lbs. of milk a\r\nyear, which makes up to 35 lbs. of cheese.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Milking the ewes at Roquefort, France (G. Ellbrecht)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe milk is set at about 80° with rennet sufficient to coagulate it in\r\n1½ to 2 hours. To cut or break and stir the curd, tools similar to those\r\nused in the manufacture of Dutch cheese are employed and stirring is\r\ncontinued until the pieces of curd are about the size of peas when the\r\nwhey is dipped off and the curd is further broken with the hand and\r\nplaced on a cloth to drain. In fifteen minutes it is ready to be put\r\ninto the hoops which are either of glazed stoneware or perforated tin, 8\r\ninches in diameter by 4 in. high.\r\n\r\nGround stale, moldy bread is sprinkled in the curd as it is put into the\r\nhoop, at the rate of 1 part of bread to 10,000 parts of curd. This moldy\r\nbread is prepared from 2 parts of wheat flour and 1 part of rye flour\r\nleavened with sour yeast and vinegar and baked hard. The loaf is placed\r\nin a dark, moist cellar to mold. In six weeks it is penetrated with mold\r\nwhen it is dried at 86° and pulverized, forming the powder used for\r\ninoculation into the cheese-curd.\r\n\r\nWhen the hoops are filled they are placed in large wooden boxes at a\r\ntemperature of 65° to 70° for the whey to drain off. The first few days\r\nthe cheese is turned three times a day, later once a day, and when five\r\ndays old it is brought into the curing room where it remains until it is\r\nfirm enough to be shipped to the large cold storage establishments,\r\nwhere it is taken care of until ready for the general market.\r\n\r\nIn the “caves” a high degree of moisture, a low temperature—40° to\r\n50°—and pure air are essential conditions.\r\n\r\nThe cheese is first _salted_ by being rubbed repeatedly with salt on all\r\nsides. The slime forming on the surface is brushed or scraped off so as\r\nnot to prevent the admission of air, which is essential to the curing.\r\nIn order to further facilitate the penetration with air the cheese is\r\nnow _pricked_ with numerous needles by means of a machine and placed on\r\nthe shelf in the cave where the proper moisture and temperature are\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nVarious fermentations are now developing, one after another, regulated\r\nby scraping, ventilation, etc., until in six to twelve weeks the cheese\r\nis ready for the market and is packed for shipment in paper or in\r\ntinfoil and in wicker baskets or airtight boxes, according to\r\ndestination,—for home consumption or for export.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Curing room in a Roquefort cheese factory (G. Ellbrecht)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Parmesan Cheese= is an Italian cheese made mostly in the Valley of the\r\nRiver Po and named from the City of Parma. It is produced from\r\npartly-skimmed milk and is allowed to become hard and dry, being used\r\ngrated with macaroni.\r\n\r\nThe milk is set with rennet at a comparatively high temperature, about\r\n95° F., and when it is firmly curdled it is broken up and stirred rather\r\nvigorously, which makes the curd fine and dry. Color is now\r\nadded—powdered _Saffron_—at the rate of 0.5 gram to 100 kg. milk. The\r\ncurd is cooked slowly under constant stirring to a temperature up\r\ntowards 100° when the whey should be perceptibly acid.\r\n\r\nThe curd is then allowed to settle in the round kettle and when fairly\r\nfirm it is lifted up in a cloth, the same as in Swiss cheesemaking. The\r\nmold is also much the same as the Swiss and the curd is but slightly\r\npressed. In the course of the day the cheese is turned once or twice and\r\nput into fresh cloth. The next day it is put into the curing room when\r\nit is rubbed with salt. In a few months the cheese is cured and is then\r\nscraped and polished with linseed oil. Sometimes it is kept in storage\r\ntwo or three years in a dark room at a temperature of 63° F. The\r\ncomposition averages: 32% water, 21% fat, 41% nitrogenous matters and 6%\r\nash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Caccio Cavallo\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Caccio Cavallo= is made in Southern Italy of a form almost like a\r\nbeetroot. The milk is set with rennet at about 95° F. and after the curd\r\nhas been broken up the whey is dipped off and heated to boiling when it\r\nis poured back on the curd. The mass is then allowed to ferment eight to\r\nfourteen hours according to the temperature of the air. The quality of\r\nthe cheese depends largely on this fermentation. The fermented curd is\r\ncut into pieces and submerged in boiling water and is then kneaded and\r\nformed into the desired shape.\r\n\r\nAfter lying in cold water for two hours and in brine for thirty hours it\r\nis dried and smoked until it attains a fine golden color. It is made in\r\nvarious sizes, from 5 to 20 pounds, and the yield is said to vary from\r\n10% to 16% of the milk. Caccio Cavallo is eaten on bread as well as with\r\nmacaroni and is much relished by the Italians.\r\n\r\n=Limburger=, =Brick=, =Munster= and other similar semi-soft cheese of\r\nthe proverbial strong flavor, originated in Belgium and Bavaria, but are\r\nnow largely made in Northern New York and Wisconsin as well.\r\n\r\nFor Limburger the milk is not ripened as for Cheddar but is set with\r\nrennet quite sweet at a temperature of about 90°; the curd is cut rather\r\nsoft, care being taken, however, not to lose butter-fat. The curd is but\r\nslightly “cooked,” to a temperature not to exceed 96°, and is not salted\r\nin the vat but is dipped out into perforated wooden boxes or molds about\r\n5 inches square and left to drain without pressure. The cheese are\r\nplaced edgeways like bricks on shelves and are rubbed with salt and\r\nturned every day until cured. During the curing process moisture exudes\r\nand a fermentation takes place which develops the well-known “Limburger”\r\nflavor. After eight or ten weeks the cheese is packed in paper and\r\ntinfoil and is ready for the market.\r\n\r\n=Brick= cheese is something between a Cheddar and a Limburger, of a\r\nmilder flavor than either, not as hard as the former but firmer than the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe milk is slightly ripened and is set with rennet at 86° so as to\r\ncoagulate in 20 minutes. The curd is “cooked” to 110° or more and is not\r\nallowed to “mat” as for Cheddar cheese, but is dipped out of the vat\r\nbefore much acidity has developed, into the molds, which are rectangular\r\nboxes without top or bottom placed on a draining table where the whey\r\nruns off.\r\n\r\nThe mold is usually 5 inches wide, 8 inches deep and 10 inches long.\r\nWhen it is filled with curd a follower is put on the top and a slight\r\nweight, a couple of bricks, on the follower. The cheese is turned a few\r\ntimes and the next day it is taken out of the mold and placed on the\r\nsalting table. The salting is done by rubbing the cheese on all sides\r\nwith salt which penetrates the curd and draws out moisture. This is\r\nrepeated for 3 days and the cheese is then left to cure, being washed\r\nand wiped off every week to prevent molding.\r\n\r\nBrick cheese is shipped one or two months old. It is wrapped in paper\r\nand packed twenty in a box.\r\n\r\n=Munster Cheese= is very much the same as Brick except for the form, it\r\nbeing round, molded in a perforated tin hoop instead of the box used for\r\nLimburger and Brick.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SOFT RENNET CHEESE\r\n\r\nThe soft cheese made with rennet may be classified as _fresh_ and\r\n_cured_.\r\n\r\n=Neufchatel.=—The fresh soft cheese of the _Neufchatel_ or _Cream\r\nCheese_ type is easily made and may be produced in any house from a\r\nsmall quantity of milk. The milk is set at a comparatively low\r\ntemperature, usually 72° F., with very little rennet, just enough to\r\ncoagulate the milk in about eighteen hours. During that time a slight\r\nacidity develops in the milk. When it is firmly curdled it is carefully\r\ndipped on to cheese-cloth suspended on a frame, or into cotton bags\r\nwhere it drains overnight.\r\n\r\nTo make the cheese quickly a starter is sometimes used and more rennet\r\nemployed. The milk is heated to 80° F., 25% starter and 7½ c.c. of\r\nrennet extract, or one rennet tablet per hundred pounds of milk, are\r\nadded and the milk curdles in about 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter draining for a few hours the curd is gently pressed for a similar\r\ntime. When the whey is fairly well expelled, the curd is kneaded or run\r\nthrough a meat cutter with a little salt, not more than 2½ oz. to 10\r\nlbs. of curd. The outfit and the manipulation is essentially the same as\r\ndescribed under Cottage cheese.\r\n\r\nA superior quality is obtained by pasteurizing the milk and if that is\r\ndone a pure culture starter should always be used. If the slow setting\r\nmethod is used a very small amount of starter, say ½%, is sufficient,\r\nbut when the quick process is employed 10% to 25% may be added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Molding Neufchatel cheese\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo give it a good appearance for market, the cheese is molded in little\r\ntin molds very much like a quarter-pound baking powder can with open\r\nends. The cylindrical roll of cheese is wrapped in parchment paper and\r\ntinfoil and is immediately ready for consumption. In an ice box it will\r\nkeep for a week or so. Neufchatel cheese may be made from whole milk or\r\npartly-skimmed milk. The yield is from 10 to 20 lbs. out of 100 lbs. of\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n=Cream Cheese= is usually made in the same way. A mixture of cream and\r\nmilk containing about 10% butter-fat is used, though sometimes the cream\r\nis not added until the time of salting. The mold is square, 2½” × 1½” ×\r\n2” deep. These soft kinds of cheese are often mixed with chopped\r\npeppers, olives or nuts and make excellent sandwiches.\r\n\r\n=Cured Soft Cheese.=—For _Cream_ or _Neufchatel_ cheese, made for\r\ncuring, the curd is salted more than for fresh cheese, or the molded\r\ncheese is rolled in salt. For a week or two it is placed in a curing\r\nroom on straw mats or the like where it ferments slightly before being\r\nwrapped and packed for shipment.\r\n\r\n=French Soft Cheese.=—The many forms of French soft cheese as\r\nrepresented by the _Brie_, the _Camembert_, etc., are subjected to\r\nspecial fermentations which give to each its peculiar flavor. Attempts\r\nhave been made to use pure cultures of the bacteria active in such\r\nfermentations and so reduce the art of cheesemaking to a more scientific\r\nprocess. But it has been found that any desired kind of cheese cannot be\r\nmade simply by adding a culture of this or that bacterium to pasteurized\r\nmilk. Of vastly greater importance for the development of the proper\r\nbacteria and flavor is the handling of the milk and the curd by the\r\nexperienced cheesemaker. Inoculation with a pure culture alone does not\r\nmake the special cheese wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CHEESE MADE WITHOUT RENNET\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mono-service jar\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Cottage Cheese.=—Of the sour milk types the common _Cottage Cheese_ is\r\nthe best known. It is made from skim milk which in a warm room will\r\ncurdle when sour, whether rennet and a starter are used or not. The\r\nthick sour milk is heated to anywhere between 100° and 120° and dipped\r\ninto bags of cheese-cloth hung up for draining. The next day light\r\npressure is applied for 12 to 24 hours, when the curd is kneaded,\r\nslightly salted, formed into balls and wrapped in parchment paper or\r\npacked into jars. For this purpose paraffined paper jars are very\r\npractical.\r\n\r\nThe more the curd is heated in the whey the drier will be the cheese.\r\nOften it is improved by allowing the curd to become rather dry and then\r\nworking new milk or a little cream into it, according to the use to\r\nwhich it is to be put—whether it is for bakers’ stock or for the table.\r\n\r\nSimple directions for making Cottage cheese are given in Farmers’\r\nBulletin 850 and A. I. 17, issued by the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture from which we reprint the following and copy the\r\naccompanying illustrations:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pouring the curdled milk on cloth to drain\r\n]\r\n\r\n“One gallon of skim milk will make about 1½ pounds of cheese. If the\r\nmilk is sweet it should be placed in a pan and allowed to remain in a\r\nclean warm place at a temperature of about 75° F., until it clabbers.\r\nThe clabbered milk should have a clean, sour flavor. Ordinarily this\r\nwill take about 30 hours, but when it is desirable to hasten the process\r\na small quantity of clean-flavored sour milk may be mixed with the sweet\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the milk has thickened or firmly clabbered it should be cut\r\ninto pieces 2 inches square, after which the curd should be stirred\r\nthoroughly with a spoon. Place the pan of broken curd in a vessel of hot\r\nwater so as to raise the temperature to 100° F. Cook at that temperature\r\nfor about 30 minutes, during which time stir gently with a spoon for 1\r\nminute at 5-minute intervals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Lifting the cloth back and forth to facilitate draining\r\n]\r\n\r\n“At the conclusion of the heating, pour the curd and whey into a small\r\ncheese-cloth bag (a clean salt bag will do nicely) and hang the bag in a\r\nfruit-strainer rack to drain, or the curd may be poured into a colander\r\nor a strainer over which a piece of cheese-cloth has been laid. After 5\r\nor 10 minutes work the curd toward the center with a spoon. Raising and\r\nlowering the ends of the cloth helps to make the whey drain faster. To\r\ncomplete the draining tie the end of the bag together and hang it up.\r\nSince there is some danger that the curd will become too dry, draining\r\nshould stop when the whey ceases to flow in a steady stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pressing the curd\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The curd is then emptied from the bag and worked with a spoon or a\r\nbutter paddle until it becomes fine in grain, smooth, and of the\r\nconsistency of mashed potatoes. Sour or sweet cream may be added to\r\nincrease the smoothness and palatability and improve the flavor. Then\r\nthe cheese is salted according to taste, about one teaspoonful to a\r\npound of curd.\r\n\r\n“Because of the ease with which the cheese can be made it is desirable\r\nto make it often so that it may be eaten fresh, although if it is kept\r\ncold it will not spoil for several days. If the cheese is not to be\r\neaten promptly it should be stored in an earthenware or glass vessel\r\nrather than in one of tin or wood, and kept in a cold place.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Apparatus needed in making cottage cheese\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Making Cottage Cheese with Rennet.=—In the bulletin mentioned a method\r\nis also given for making the cheese with rennet or pepsin. Junket\r\nTablets make a convenient form of rennet to be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed for this method are:\r\n\r\n1. A finer textured and more uniform cheese.\r\n\r\n2. The making requires less time and attention.\r\n\r\n3. Losses of fat in the whey are reduced.\r\n\r\nThe process is the same as described above except that a solution of\r\n_Junket Tablets_ is added to the milk at the rate of one tablet to 100\r\nlbs. of milk. For less milk use a fraction of a tablet, or dissolve one\r\ntablet in ten tablespoonfuls of water and use one spoonful of the\r\nsolution for each 10 lbs. of milk.\r\n\r\nIf a starter is used the rennet solution is added immediately after the\r\nstarter is put in; if no starter is used the milk is left for five or\r\nsix hours at 80° F. to ripen before adding the rennet. The milk will\r\ncurdle overnight.\r\n\r\nAfter draining for thirty minutes on cotton sheeting the ends of the\r\ncloth are tied together and a weight is placed on top to press the curd\r\ngently until the desired consistency is attained.\r\n\r\nSalt may be worked in at the rate of 2½ ounces to 10 lbs. of curd. If\r\ndesired, add sweet or sour cream at the rate of ½ pint to 10 lbs. of\r\ncurd or ¼ pint of cream to the product from 30 lbs. of milk.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Cottage cheese made with rennet is really the same\r\nas Neufchatel cheese, the only difference being in the form and packing\r\nor wrapping of the finished cheese.\r\n\r\n=Snappy Cheese.=—By allowing the sour skim milk curd to ferment under\r\ncareful regulation, a variety of sharp, snappy, more or less hard cheese\r\ncan be made. Though there is no general demand for them, some kinds are\r\nquite popular in their own restricted localities. The Danish _Appetite\r\ncheese_ is only one of the many varieties which have as many names.\r\n\r\n=Club Cheese= and similar varieties are made by grinding up old dry\r\ncheese with a little butter and packing the product in jars or other\r\nattractive packages. American, Roquefort, or any other well-known type\r\nmay be used as the stock for these cheeses. Everywhere they are\r\nfavorites in dining cars and lunch rooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Milking the goat in Norway\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Whey Cheese.=—In Switzerland the so-called _Zieger cheese_ is made from\r\nsour whey, the albumin being coagulated by heat and, with whatever\r\nbutter-fat there may be left in the whey, skimmed off the top. In Norway\r\n_Myseost_ (“Ost” is Norwegian for cheese) is made by boiling down whey\r\nalmost to dryness. If goat milk is available to mix in, it improves the\r\ncheese. The main substance is sugar of milk and the cheese has a sweet,\r\nsyrupy flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MILK SUGAR\r\n\r\nThe by-product, sugar of milk, is produced by acidifying the whey,\r\nheating to boiling and neutralizing with lime until the albumin is\r\ncoagulated. It is then filtered out and the clarified liquid is\r\nconcentrated in vacuum. From the thick syrup the sugar is allowed to\r\ncrystallize out, leaving the salts or mineral matters (milk-ash) in the\r\nremaining liquid. The use of milk-sugar is limited to medicinal purposes\r\nand for modifying milk for infants. The production is therefore not very\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CASEIN\r\n\r\nIn a number of creameries casein is produced from skim milk by\r\nprecipitating it with an acid and drying and pulverizing the\r\nprecipitate. Casein is widely used as a substitute for ivory, in\r\nbilliard balls, buttons, etc. It is also used as glue, and as a binder\r\nin paints.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MILK POWDER\r\n\r\nThe production and use of dry milk has increased enormously during the\r\nlast few years and the processes of manufacture have been improved\r\nwell-nigh to perfection. There are several methods practiced, the most\r\nimportant being the following:\r\n\r\nThe _Just-Hatmaker_, in which a large metal drum or cylinder revolves\r\nslowly in a tank of milk. The drum is heated by steam inside and, as it\r\nrolls out of the milk, the metal surface picks up a thin film of milk\r\nwhich quickly dries and is removed by a scraper.\r\n\r\nThe _Eckenberg_ process employs vacuum evaporating pans, like those used\r\nfor making condensed milk and maple syrup.\r\n\r\nThe _Merrell-Soule_ Company’s method consists in driving a blast of hot\r\nair into a fine spray of milk, which at once reduces the milk to a fine\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nIn the “_Economic_” process the milk is dried by hot air the same as in\r\nthe Merrell-Soule method, but in dropping through a tower from a height\r\nof some 30 feet the milk meets several blasts of air of different\r\ntemperatures. It is claimed that in this way alone rich milk and cream\r\nmay be reduced to a powder without injury to, or change of, the original\r\nfat globules.\r\n\r\n=Skim Milk Powder.=—Beautiful skim milk powders are now made which\r\ndissolve perfectly in water. Containing, as they do, the extremely\r\nnourishing constituents of the fatless milk in a most palatable form,\r\nthey can be used in baking and in many food products to great advantage.\r\n\r\n=Whole Milk Powder.=—Until recently dried whole milk was not produced of\r\ngood keeping quality as the butter-fat had a tendency to become rancid\r\nbefore many months. But improvements are constantly being made and milk\r\npowders of every degree of richness bid fair to take the place of fresh\r\nmilk on board ships and in other places where milk must be kept a long\r\ntime before being used.\r\n\r\nIn many new food preparations of value, milk powder is filling a\r\nlong-felt want. Dissolved in 8 or 9 times as much water, milk powder\r\nmakes a liquid almost identical with pasteurized fresh milk.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned under the chapter on “Cream” and under\r\n“Ice Cream” how skim milk powder and unsalted butter, _emulsified_ in a\r\nsuitable amount of water or milk, make an excellent material for ice\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CONDENSED AND EVAPORATED MILK\r\n\r\nMilk cannot be boiled down in a common open kettle or steam boiler\r\nwithout being scorched. Evaporating or condensing is therefore usually\r\ndone in a vacuum pan at a low temperature. Condensed to one-third of its\r\nvolume and excluded from the air by canning, milk will keep well for\r\nmonths, and has many uses as a substitute for fresh milk. Often sugar is\r\nadded as a preservative, and where sugar would be added anyway, as in\r\ncoffee, ice cream, etc., this is unobjectionable.\r\n\r\nFor purposes where sugar is not wanted, unsweetened condensed or\r\nevaporated milk is on the market, so carefully made that the taste of\r\nthe original milk is hardly changed at all by the process. When water is\r\nadded in the proportion of two parts of water to one of the evaporated\r\nmilk, the fluid obtained excels even that from milk powder in its\r\nresemblance to fresh milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  WHEY\r\n\r\nWhey is a by-product in cheesemaking. Usually it is fed to hogs and\r\nespecially together with grain or bran it makes an excellent food for\r\nthem. But whey is also prepared for human food. In the hospital or in\r\nthe home it serves as a substitute for milk when a mild diet of easily\r\ndigested food is temporarily required for a weak stomach. For such\r\npurposes it must not be allowed to become acid as in cheesemaking, but\r\nshould be prepared as the chief product from sweet new milk or freshly\r\nseparated skim milk. The sweet milk is set with rennet—one Junket\r\nTablet, dissolved in cold water, to a quart of milk—at a temperature of\r\n90° to 100° F. As soon as a firm curd is formed it is carefully broken\r\nup and transferred to a strainer of cheese-cloth. Unless it is to be\r\nused at once, the whey strained off should be immediately cooled to 50°\r\nor lower. If left at a higher temperature it will soon become sour. A\r\nteaspoonful of limewater to a quart, or a pinch of soda, will help to\r\nkeep it sweet. Still, in any event, it should not be kept long, but\r\nprepared fresh when required.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                             MILK AS A FOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk is first of all the food for the young,—until a certain age the\r\nonly food, and a perfect food. It contains but little refuse or waste\r\nand is under favorable conditions almost wholly digestible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NUTRIENTS\r\n\r\nAll foods contain certain groups of nutrients which may be classified\r\naccording to various functions in nutrition and their chemical\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n=Protein.=—The protein group of nutrients contains nitrogen and is\r\nnecessary for building up the tissues of the body, the muscles and the\r\ntendons which also contain nitrogen. Only by this group can tissues\r\nwasted by constant wear and tear be rebuilt. Proteins are the\r\nflesh-forming group. To some degree the proteins or albuminoids are also\r\nactive in producing fat in the body, but the other groups of nutrients,\r\nespecially the fats, also contribute.\r\n\r\n=Fats and Carbohydrates.=—Another important function of food is to\r\nproduce and maintain the animal heat. The main sources of this necessity\r\nare the fats and the carbohydrates, so called because they consist of\r\nthe element carbon combined with oxygen and hydrogen, the last two in\r\nthe exact proportion in which they are combined in water. All of these\r\nthree groups furnish the fuel, so to speak, for the body, but they are\r\nnot equal in this respect. Pound for pound, when burned in the body, the\r\nfats yield 2¼ times as much heat as protein or the carbohydrates.\r\n\r\n=Mineral Matters.=—Finally there are in all foods the mineral matters, a\r\ngroup containing a number of salts which are indispensable because they\r\nare constituents of every part of the body. Phosphate of lime, for\r\ninstance, makes up one-half of the substance of the bones, and the\r\nsulphates and chlorides of potash and soda, iron, etc., are everywhere\r\npresent in smaller quantities. No food in which any of them is lacking\r\nis complete.\r\n\r\n=Relation.=—The value of a food depends largely upon the relation of one\r\ngroup of nutrients to another. Proper nutrition can only be obtained\r\nwhen a sufficient amount of flesh-forming as well as of heat-producing\r\nnutrients are present, when the “nutritive ratio” is properly balanced\r\nfor the particular purpose in view, be it the growth of the child, the\r\nmaintenance of the body, the restoration of matter consumed by labor of\r\nbody or brain, or the supply of heat to make up for cold surroundings.\r\n\r\n=Milk contains all= of these groups of nutrients. The protein is\r\nrepresented in milk by the casein and albumin, the fats by the\r\nbutter-fat, the carbohydrates by milk-sugar, and the mineral matters by\r\nthe milk-ash. Human milk contains them in a perfect proportion for\r\ninfants, and for all purposes of nutrition cow’s milk may be used to\r\nmake up a “balanced ration,” if not alone, then in connection with other\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n=Nutritive Ratio.=—As we said before, the “nutritive ratio” of a food\r\nmeans the ratio of its flesh-forming constituents—proteins—to its\r\nheat-producing nutrients—carbohydrates and fats. Cow’s milk, containing\r\n3.25% protein, 4% fat and 5% milk-sugar, has a nutritive ratio of 1 :\r\n4.3, i. e., 1 part of protein to 4.3 parts of heat-giving nutrients,\r\ncounting the fat equal to 2¼ of carbohydrates (multiplying the 4% fat by\r\n2¼ makes 9, added to the 5% of sugar, makes 14; 3.25 to 14 equals 1 to\r\n4.3). Skim milk, containing 3.4% protein, 0.2% fat, and 5.1% sugar, has\r\na ratio of 1 : 1.6 (3.4 : 5.45). Mother’s milk, containing 2% protein,\r\n4% fat, and 6.5% carbohydrates, has a ratio of 1 : 7.75. To substitute\r\ncow’s milk for mother’s, it must therefore be “modified.”\r\n\r\n=Calories.=—Another way of comparing various foods than by the nutritive\r\nratio is by measuring their “fuel value” or energy-producing capacity.\r\nThe amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of\r\nwater 1° C., or one pound 4° F., is called a calorie. By extensive\r\nfeeding experiments the caloric value of the various nutrient groups has\r\nbeen estimated as follows:\r\n\r\n                Protein at 1820 calories per pound[9]\r\n                Fats    at 4040 calories per pound\r\n                Carbohydrates at 1820 calories per pound\r\n\r\nMeasured by this rule the fuel value of:\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Whole milk is    310 calories per\r\n                                   pound\r\n\r\n                  Skim milk is     160 calories per\r\n                                   pound\r\n\r\n                  Full cream       1885 calories per\r\n                  cheese is        pound\r\n\r\n                  Butter is        3410 calories per\r\n                                   pound\r\n\r\n\r\nCompared with other food, milk, although not suited to act as the sole\r\nfood of adults, is one of the best and cheapest articles of diet, and\r\nshould be much more extensively used.\r\n\r\nThe following table, compiled by specialists of the U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture, shows the quantities of various foods needed to supply as\r\nmuch protein or energy as 1 quart of milk:\r\n\r\n\r\n      ┌────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┐\r\n      │          Protein           │           Energy           │\r\n      ├────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────┤\r\n      │1 quart of milk is equal to—│1 quart of milk is equal to—│\r\n      │  7 ounces of sirloin steak │  11.3 ounces of sirloin    │\r\n      │  6 ounces of round steak   │  steak                     │\r\n      │  4.3 eggs                  │  14.9 ounces of round steak│\r\n      │  8.6 ounces of fowl        │  9 eggs                    │\r\n      │                            │  14.5 ounces of fowl       │\r\n      └────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother method of comparison is shown by the table below, in which the\r\nrelative value of certain foods as economical sources of protein is\r\ngiven:\r\n\r\n        ┌────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────┐\r\n        │                │  Is as cheap as  │                  │\r\n        │    Milk at—    │sirloin steak at— │   Or eggs at—    │\r\n        ├────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤\r\n        │7 cents a quart │16.3 cents a pound│17.6 cents a dozen│\r\n        │8 cents a quart │18.6 cents a pound│20.1 cents a dozen│\r\n        │9 cents a quart │21.0 cents a pound│22.6 cents a dozen│\r\n        │10 cents a quart│23.3 cents a pound│25.1 cents a dozen│\r\n        │12 cents a quart│27.9 cents a pound│30.2 cents a dozen│\r\n        │15 cents a quart│34.9 cents a pound│37.7 cents a dozen│\r\n        └────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to this table, if milk is selling at 10 cents a quart, sirloin\r\nsteak must sell as low as 23.3 cents a pound, and eggs at 25.1 cents a\r\ndozen to supply protein at equal cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _To Supply Energy at Equal Cost_\r\n\r\n        ┌────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────┐\r\n        │                │  Sirloin steak   │                  │\r\n        │When milk is—   │     must not     │   And eggs not   │\r\n        │                │  be more than—   │    more than—    │\r\n        ├────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────┤\r\n        │7 cents a quart │9.9 cents a pound │ 9.3 cents a dozen│\r\n        │8 cents a quart │11.3 cents a pound│10.6 cents a dozen│\r\n        │9 cents a quart │12.8 cents a pound│11.9 cents a dozen│\r\n        │10 cents a quart│14.2 cents a pound│13.2 cents a dozen│\r\n        │12 cents a quart│17.0 cents a pound│15.9 cents a dozen│\r\n        │15 cents a quart│21.3 cents a pound│19.8 cents a dozen│\r\n        └────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fallacy of Theoretical Valuation.=—While the contents of protein and\r\nthe ratio between digestible protein and fats and carbohydrates on one\r\nhand, and the fuel or energy value on the other, have long been the only\r\nrecognized measures for food values, they are admittedly quite\r\ninadequate and insufficient and although they are a great help when used\r\nwith discrimination in making up food rations, they are often abused by\r\npersons who do not take their fallacies into consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Dr. E. V. McCollum\r\n]\r\n\r\n“=Something Unknown.=”—Recent investigations by Dr. F. G. Hopkins, of\r\nCambridge, England, and Dr. E. V. McCollum, formerly of Wisconsin, now\r\nof the Johns Hopkins University, have proven conclusively that one food\r\ningredient cannot always be substituted for another with impunity even\r\nthough the most searching chemical analysis shows them both alike in\r\ncontents and digestibility. There is “Something Unknown” in certain\r\nfoods—“Vitamines” some call it—essential especially in promoting the\r\ngrowth of the young, which our present knowledge of chemistry cannot\r\nexplain. In Bulletin No. 17 of the Wisconsin Experiment Station\r\nexperiments with the feeding of rats are described which show how\r\nbutter-fat could not be replaced in the ration by vegetable fats of\r\napparently the same composition and digestibility without disastrous\r\nresults, and similar conditions have been found in regard to other\r\nfoodstuffs, proteins as well as fats. The yolk of eggs and butter-fat\r\ncontain this unknown something which is absolutely essential for the\r\ngrowth of the child and which is missing in most substitutes, especially\r\nin lard and vegetable fats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The rat on the left got five per cent of cottonseed oil and the one on\r\n    the right got instead one and a half per cent of butter-fat,\r\n    otherwise their rations were alike. These results are typical for\r\n    any ration made up of purified foodstuffs with butter-fat in them as\r\n    compared with any fat of plant origin. The plant fats lack an\r\n    unknown something without which growth cannot proceed.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe above illustration is from the work of McCollum and Davis at the\r\nWisconsin Experiment Station.\r\n\r\nRealizing the fallacy of the old rules for making up rations for the\r\nfeeding of farm animals, Professor Evvard of Iowa is trying the\r\n_reliability_ of the _instincts_ of animals as a guide to the proper\r\nselection of the most favorable combinations and proportions of food\r\ningredients.[10]\r\n\r\nWe mention these experiments as a warning against placing too great\r\nreliance on the caloric theory or the relation of nutrients in making up\r\nfood rations. We have yet much to learn and the good housewife trying to\r\ncook according to scientific rules will do well not to neglect the\r\npalatability of the food, but to watch the “instinct” which causes the\r\nchild or the adult to reject or approve of, and enjoy, the food, which\r\nin most cases is a better guide than calories or protein contents, or\r\nthe ration between the various groups of nutrients.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CARE OF MILK IN THE HOME\r\n\r\nIf received fresh and warm from the cow, milk should at once be strained\r\nthrough absorbent cotton or several thicknesses of cheese-cloth into\r\nwide-mouthed bottles or glass jars and placed in running water or ice\r\nwater to cool as quickly as possible. If obtained from the milkman it\r\nmay be left in the bottle in which it is received. The practice of\r\ndelivering milk “loose,” dipping it from the wagon, should not be\r\npermitted, and is fast being abolished. Public safety demands that it\r\nshould be bottled on the farm or in the creamery or milk station under\r\nsanitary conditions.\r\n\r\n=Keep the Milk Cool.=—If the milk when delivered at the house is not\r\ncold enough to keep sweet as long as desired, it should, we repeat, be\r\nplaced in ice water or cold running water until thoroughly cooled. Even\r\nif the air is cold, in the ice box, for instance, the milk cannot be\r\ncooled quickly enough without water. After it has been cooled in water\r\nit may be put in the ice box. In most ice boxes the temperature is\r\nallowed to rise higher than is generally supposed, and it is better to\r\nkeep the milk bottle next to the ice than in the food compartments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A clean ice box\r\n]\r\n\r\nMilk and cream easily absorb flavors from the air and should not be kept\r\nin open vessels next to other food. Any housekeeper knows how quickly\r\nmilk or cream will be tainted by standing in the same compartment with\r\nonions or muskmelons; if the bottle is not covered, milk may also be\r\ncontaminated by other less noticeable but more harmful vapors from\r\nnearby products. Let the milkman furnish you with some extra milk bottle\r\ncaps, or cover your milk bottle with an inverted tumbler.\r\n\r\nAs has been shown in previous chapters, milk is a favorable soil for all\r\nsorts of germs and bacteria to grow in. It must therefore be kept from\r\ncontamination with the utmost care, and everything that comes in contact\r\nwith it must be scrupulously clean.\r\n\r\n=Top-Milk.=—When the milk has been standing at rest three or four hours,\r\nthe top-milk will be considerably richer than the rest. If such rich\r\nmilk is wanted for any particular purpose it may be poured off, to be\r\neaten with cereals, berries, etc. In twelve hours most of the cream will\r\nrise and may be skimmed off, although thirty-six or even forty-eight\r\nhours may be required to get all that can be obtained by setting. The\r\nhalf-skimmed milk left when the top-milk has been removed after 3 to 6\r\nhours’ setting will still contain 2% or more of butter-fat and is very\r\ngood for drinking; even the skim milk from which the cream has been\r\ntaken after 12 hours’ setting is still an excellent beverage, provided\r\nit is sweet. Perfectly skimmed, almost entirely fatless, milk may be\r\nused in various ways in cooking, to make up for lack of protein in many\r\nother food products. But care must be taken that it is pure and sweet,\r\nor rather, its condition, sweet or sour, must be under the perfect\r\ncontrol of the housekeeper. If a sample of milk will stand scalding or\r\neven boiling without curdling, it is usually fresh and in good condition\r\nfor any use. On the other hand, if it curdles by scalding, it is beyond\r\ncontrol and it may or may not make good sour milk, depending on the\r\nbacteria working in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MILK FOR INFANTS\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nComparing cow’s milk with mother’s milk, it will be seen that the latter\r\ncontains less protein, about the same percentage of fat and more\r\ncarbohydrates than the former. A comparison may be made from the\r\nfollowing table of average composition in round figures:\r\n\r\n\r\n ──────────────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────\r\n               │       │       │       │       │       │       │ Fuel\r\n               │ Water │ Total │Protein│  Fat  │ Milk- │Mineral│ value\r\n               │       │solids │       │       │ sugar │matters│per lb.\r\n ──────────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n               │  Per  │  Per  │  Per  │  Per  │  Per  │  Per  │Calories\r\n               │ cent  │ cent  │ cent  │ cent  │ cent  │ cent  │\r\n ──────────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n Mother’s Milk │  87   │  13   │   2   │   4   │  6.5  │  0.5  │  316\r\n ──────────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n Cow’s Milk    │  87   │  13   │ 3.25  │   4   │   5   │ 0.75  │  312\r\n ──────────────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────\r\n\r\n\r\n=Modifying Milk.=—Undiluted cow’s milk is too rich in protein and in\r\nsalts for infants and, when fed without modification, must be diluted\r\nwith an equal amount of water during the first two or three months. Such\r\ndilution, however, also reduces the percentage of fat, which should\r\nremain the same, and of carbohydrates, which should be increased. In\r\norder to modify or “humanize” cow’s milk so as to make its composition\r\nnearly the same as that of mother’s milk, simple dilution with water is\r\ntherefore not sufficient.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, various other methods which may be used to\r\nadvantage. For instance, top-milk from a bottle of fresh milk which has\r\nstood 4 or 6 hours in ice water will contain 6 to 8% of fat. By diluting\r\nthis with an equal part of water, the percentage of protein, fat and\r\nmineral matter will be about right, and sugar, either cane-sugar or\r\nmilk-sugar, may be added to supply the carbohydrates. Or carefully\r\nprepared sweet whey containing milk-sugar, or barley water, may be added\r\nto the thin cream in place of some of the pure water.\r\n\r\nThe following recipes have been used with good results:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Mrs. Pospyhala’s Recipe\r\n\r\n    =Infant Food.=—Warm 1½ quarts of milk to blood heat. Remove from\r\n    fire and add one Junket Tablet dissolved in a spoonful of cold\r\n    water. Let the milk set until it forms a solid mass, then stir\r\n    it up in order to break the curd. Place it back on the fire and\r\n    stir until quite smooth, not allowing it to get any warmer than\r\n    blood heat. It is then ready to strain through two thicknesses\r\n    of cheese-cloth and care must be taken to squeeze well so as to\r\n    obtain as much of the whey as possible, which is very important.\r\n    Add one tablespoonful of sugar to sweeten. Pour into nursing\r\n    bottles, the amount being according to the age of the baby. A\r\n    sufficient number of bottles are prepared for 24 hours’ feeding.\r\n    Care should be taken to keep the milk in a cool place as it will\r\n    sour the same as fresh milk. Every time the baby is fed the milk\r\n    must be warmed by placing the bottle in a pan of water and\r\n    heating to the right temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Mrs. Rorer’s Recipe_\r\n\r\n    Where cow’s milk, even when diluted, or partly modified as in\r\n    the home fashion, disagrees with the infant, this mixture may be\r\n    used with good results: heat two quarts of milk to 100° F. Add\r\n    two Junket Tablets dissolved in a tablespoonful of cold water.\r\n    When the milk is congealed and perfectly solid draw through it\r\n    backward and forward an ordinary four-tined silver fork; this\r\n    will separate the curd. Strain through two thicknesses of\r\n    cheese-cloth, saving the whey as this is the part you are to\r\n    use; add a pint of water, a half ounce of sugar of milk, three\r\n    ounces of cream and four ounces of the white of egg. The whites\r\n    may be dropped into a quart fruit jar, a pint of the whey added,\r\n    the top screwed on and the jar thoroughly shaken until the\r\n    whites are well mixed with the whey; then add them to the\r\n    remaining quantity and stand at once in a very cold place. This\r\n    will be given in quantities from two to three ounces in an\r\n    ordinary nursing bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _RECIPES_\r\n                  _of the Nathan Straus Laboratories_\r\n\r\nFormula by Dr. A.

Feed 3 hours\r\napart.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 9th month:—\r\n\r\nFull pasteurized milk, 8 ounces every 4 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the modified milk can be obtained from a dairy laboratory where it\r\nis prepared with scientific care and accuracy, it is better to use it\r\nthan to depend on home-made preparations, and in many cases a doctor’s\r\nprescription may be necessary. Even if the modified cow’s milk is\r\nprepared so as to contain apparently the same proportion of the various\r\ngroups of nutrients as mother’s milk, there may still be some essential\r\ndifference. For instance, the protein in human milk consists mainly of\r\nalbumin, while that of cow’s milk is mostly casein. It is often a\r\nquestion whether the individual baby can digest the casein without\r\ntrouble. A trifle of rennet ferment,—a fraction of a Junket\r\nTablet,—added to the modified cow’s milk just before feeding may be\r\nbeneficial to overcome that defect. A little limewater also is healthful\r\nas it neutralizes any acid that may develop in the mixture. For the\r\nparticular needs of the individual baby, a competent doctor should be\r\nasked to prescribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MILK FOR GROWING CHILDREN\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the child is big enough to thrive on undiluted, unmodified cow’s\r\nmilk, it should not only be allowed, but urged, to continue on a diet in\r\nwhich this, the best of all foods, is the most essential part. An\r\nexcellent form in which to feed milk to the growing child is junket.\r\nEaten slowly with a spoon as a pudding, it is exposed to the action of\r\ndigestion much better than milk swallowed by the glassful in a hurry and\r\neven if it is cold there is no danger of defective rennet action in the\r\nstomach because such action has already taken place.\r\n\r\nDoctors still disagree as to the desirability of pasteurizing milk for\r\nyoung children (see “Pasteurization,” Chapter I), some holding that the\r\ndigestibility is affected by the process. The truth is probably that\r\nstrong pasteurization at a temperature above 157° and holding the heated\r\nmilk unnecessarily long at such high temperature do change the\r\nproperties of the milk so as to make it harder to digest, but that the\r\nmain difficulty is in the change of diet from raw to pasteurized milk or\r\nvice versa. Let the child get used to the change by making it gradual,\r\ndiminishing the amount of one and increasing the amount of the other\r\nfrom day to day in a week, until the change is completed, and there will\r\nusually be little if any trouble. The secretions of digestive ferments\r\nin the stomach soon adapt themselves to the change in the food. The same\r\nholds good in case of other changes, as, for instance, from whole milk\r\nto more or less fatless milk, with additions of cereals or other partial\r\nsubstitutes;—it is always advisable to make any change in the child’s\r\ndiet gradual.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                              MILK COOKERY\r\n\r\n\r\nMilk should also be used a great deal more than it is by grown persons,\r\nnot only as a drink but in the daily cookery. In some homes milk in some\r\nform is a part of every menu and the meals are more delicious,\r\nattractive and nourishing than the ordinary milkless diet, and are also\r\nless expensive, as the milk takes the place of part of the meat. Dr.\r\nGraham Tusk of Cornell University, who represented the United States on\r\nthe Interallied Council of Alimentation, says:\r\n\r\n    “No family of five should spend any money for meat until three\r\n    quarts of milk have been purchased, and this should be done even\r\n    though the price of milk should go to twenty cents a quart.\r\n    Absolutely nothing in the food line will keep children so\r\n    healthy as their daily supply of milk.”\r\n\r\nIn cooking with milk it is well to remember:\r\n\r\n1. That, although milk is a liquid, it contains a large amount of solid\r\nfood and of exceedingly nourishing, palatable and easily digestible\r\nfood, much more than many vegetables or fruits. While milk has 13% of\r\nsolid matter, water-melon has only 2%, turnips 4%, beets 12%, etc. When\r\nsubstituting milk for water, you add _nourishment_ to the food and it is\r\nwell to keep in mind the ingredients,—the amount of protein, fat, etc.,\r\nadded in the form of milk, which may take the place of other similar\r\ningredients in the combination.\r\n\r\n2. That if milk is even but slightly sour, or if some other acid is\r\nadded to it,—in the form of fruit, for instance,—it is apt to curdle by\r\nscalding or boiling.\r\n\r\nThe limits of a single chapter do not allow many recipes to be given,\r\nbut a few are furnished under each of the several kinds of milk dishes,\r\nand a clever domestic science pupil or the ordinary good housekeeper and\r\ncook can easily add to these recipes indefinitely, by following out the\r\nsimple suggestions offered.\r\n\r\nAll measurements are level.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SOUPS\r\n\r\n=Cream Soups.=—So-called cream soups may be made with or without the\r\naddition of meat stock. For example:\r\n\r\n                            =Asparagus Soup=\r\n\r\n    3 cups veal or chicken broth\r\n    1 can asparagus\r\n    ¼ cup butter\r\n    ¼ cup flour\r\n    1 qt. scalded milk\r\n    Salt and pepper\r\n\r\nReserve tips of asparagus. Add stalks to cold stock, boil fifteen\r\nminutes, rub through sieve, thicken with butter and flour cooked\r\ntogether, add milk, tips, salt and pepper. If fresh asparagus is used,\r\ncut one bunch in small pieces, boil in as little water as will cover,\r\nremove tough bits of stalk, add two cups stock and proceed as above.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Cream of Celery Soup=\r\n\r\n                    3 cups veal or chicken broth\r\n                    3 cups celery cut in inch pieces\r\n                    4 cups milk\r\n                    Yolks 2 eggs\r\n                    ½ cup cream\r\n                    Salt and pepper\r\n\r\nBoil celery in broth till tender. Rub through sieve, add milk, bring to\r\nthe boiling point and add egg yolks beaten and diluted with cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Spinach Soup=\r\n\r\n                          4 cups broth\r\n                          2 qts. spinach\r\n                          3 cups boiling water\r\n                          2 cups milk\r\n                          ¼ cup butter\r\n                          ½ cup flour\r\n                          Salt and pepper\r\n\r\nWash the spinach and cook thirty minutes in boiling water to which ⅛\r\nteaspoon soda has been added. Drain and chop fine. Add stock and butter\r\nand flour cooked together, milk and seasoning.\r\n\r\nCauliflower, mushrooms, lettuce, string beans, onions and other\r\nvegetables may be used for soups in the same way. _In all of these\r\nrecipes milk may be substituted for the stock._ The soups will be more\r\nnourishing, many like them better, and they are more easily prepared.\r\n\r\nIf canned vegetables are used they may be added to the thickened milk,\r\nwhich should be made in the proportions of one quart of milk to two\r\ntablespoons butter or substitute and two tablespoons flour. One can of\r\nbeans, peas, asparagus, or corn, may be added to three pints of\r\nthickened milk.\r\n\r\nIf fresh vegetables are used, they should be boiled in as little water\r\nas possible and this water added with the vegetables to the hot,\r\nthickened milk. The addition of one-half to one cup of cream to these\r\nsoups improves their taste but is not necessary. If the cream is whipped\r\nand added just before serving, the appearance is also much improved. The\r\nvegetables may be pressed through a sieve or not, as preferred. If the\r\nsoup is to be served in cups it is better to do this or chop the\r\nvegetables very fine, but if the soup is to be served in soup plates it\r\nlooks attractive and is more substantial if the vegetables are cut in\r\ninch pieces and left in the soup.\r\n\r\nAll cooks are familiar with _cornlet soup_, _tomato_ _bisque_, and\r\n_oyster_ and _clam stews_, the foundation of which is also milk. Plenty\r\nof good recipes for them can be found in any standard cook book.\r\n\r\n=Cereal Cream Soups.=—There is another class of soups used much in\r\nEurope but, unfortunately, little known here. They are very nourishing,\r\neasy of preparation, and delicious.\r\n\r\nA few recipes will suffice to introduce the housewife to this class of\r\nsoups and she can then easily add to the varieties herself. Her family\r\nwill enjoy the new dishes for their good taste and their novelty.\r\nCroutons, crackers, zwieback, or toast may be served with any of them.\r\nThey should always be prepared in a double boiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Rice Soup=\r\n\r\n                          1 qt. milk\r\n                          ⅓ cup rice\r\n                          1 tablespoon butter\r\n                          1 tablespoon sugar\r\n\r\nHeat the milk in a double boiler, add the rice and cook two hours. Add\r\nsugar and butter. Sprinkle cinnamon on each plate of soup when serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Sago Soup=\r\n\r\n                          1 qt. milk\r\n                          4 tablespoons sago\r\n                          1 tablespoon butter\r\n                          1 egg yolk\r\n                          2 tablespoons sugar\r\n\r\nHeat the milk in a double boiler, add sago and cook one-half hour. Care\r\nmust be taken to stir the mixture often when the sago is first added or\r\nit will lump. Add butter and egg yolk beaten with sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Oatmeal Soup=\r\n\r\n                          1 cup oat flakes\r\n                          1 pint boiling water\r\n                          2 tablespoons sugar\r\n                          1 pint milk\r\n                          1 tablespoon butter\r\n\r\nAdd oat flakes to water and boil one-half hour. Add milk and boil\r\none-half hour, add sugar and butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =Farina or Cream of Wheat Soup=\r\n\r\n                     3 pints milk\r\n                     ½ cup farina or cream of wheat\r\n                     1 tablespoon butter\r\n                     1 tablespoon sugar\r\n\r\nScald milk and add cereal slowly. Cook one hour and add butter and sugar\r\nand a sprinkling of nutmeg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Milk Chowders=\r\n\r\nChowders are also a very acceptable way of serving milk. For rich\r\nchowders the proportions used are: Two cups of milk or of milk and\r\nwater, 1 cup of potatoes cut into small pieces and 1 pound of fish. For\r\nflavoring add an onion fried in two tablespoons of fat tried out from\r\nsalt pork. While these proportions make a rich dish, it is possible to\r\nreduce the amount of fish greatly, to leave it out entirely, to use\r\nsmall portions of left-over fish or some salt codfish which has been\r\nfreshened, or to substitute corn for it. Such dishes are palatable and\r\nof reasonably high nutritive value, providing the greater part of the\r\nliquid used is milk.\r\n\r\nSimilar, but less rich and thick, is:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Milk Stew=\r\n\r\n 1 qt. of milk\r\n 1 cupful raw potatoes cut into small pieces\r\n 2 tablespoonfuls of butter or bacon fat\r\n 1 cupful of codfish cut into small pieces or just enough to flavor the\r\n    stew\r\n\r\nSoak the fish in lukewarm water until it is soft and the salt removed.\r\nCook the potatoes in water until tender, drain them, add the milk and\r\ncodfish, and bring to the boiling point; add the butter and salt to\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nIn place of the codfish, fresh fish, clams, oysters, or a little chipped\r\nbeef may be used. Or the fish may be omitted and the soup made savory\r\nand palatable by adding a few drops of onion juice, or cheese or a\r\nvegetable cut into small pieces and cooked thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MILK CEREALS\r\n\r\nMost cereals are better cooked in milk than in water and those not\r\nfamiliar with this method have no idea of the many good dishes which\r\nthey can thus easily provide for their families. Cereals so prepared\r\nmake an especially good wholesome breakfast or supper for school\r\nchildren and the writer has never seen an adult, who, on a cold night,\r\ndid not enjoy a dish of rice, or corn meal, boiled in milk and served\r\nwith cream and sugar for supper. Milk cereals must always be cooked in a\r\ndouble boiler and the milk must be hot when the cereal is added.\r\n\r\n     Rice            1 cup to 3 cups milk, boil 2 hours\r\n     Cornmeal        1 cup to 4 cups milk, boil 1 to 2 hours\r\n     Fine Hominy     1 cup to 4 cups milk, boil 1 hour\r\n     Cream of Wheat  1 cup to 4 cups milk, boil 1 hour\r\n     Farina          1 cup to 4 cups milk, boil 1 hour\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cream of Wheat or Farina Pudding= is also delicious. It is prepared in\r\nthe same way, but ¾ cup of cereal only is added to 1 quart hot milk.\r\nJust before serving, a teaspoonful of vanilla is added, and two beaten\r\neggs are folded in. It is eaten with cream, or milk, and sugar, or with\r\nmaple syrup.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       LUNCHEON AND SUPPER DISHES\r\n\r\nDishes prepared principally of milk, with the addition of either eggs,\r\ncheese, meat, or vegetables are particularly adapted for luncheon or\r\nsupper use. Here again a few standard recipes are given which can be\r\nvaried to make any desired number of good, wholesome and delicious\r\ndishes.\r\n\r\n=Creamed Dishes.=—The same sauce may be used to cream _cold chicken_,\r\n_lamb_, _veal_, _chipped beef_, and cold boiled or baked _fish_, canned\r\n_salmon_, _lobster_ or _shrimps_, according to the following recipe:\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Creamed Chicken=\r\n\r\n                2 cups cold cooked chicken cut into dice\r\n                3 tablespoons butter\r\n                3 tablespoons flour\r\n                1½ cups milk\r\n                Salt and pepper\r\n\r\nMelt butter and add the flour and milk. Bring to the boiling point and\r\nadd diced chicken. Season with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nMany grate a small onion into the sauce before adding the chicken. The\r\nwriter does not favor indiscriminate use of onion as it tends to make\r\nall dishes taste alike. It seems better to use sometimes a little celery\r\nor celery salt, sometimes an onion, and again frequently no flavor but\r\nthe chicken or meat or fish. One’s cooking is thus more distinctive and\r\nvaried.\r\n\r\nIf the creamed mixture is turned into a baking dish, covered with\r\nbuttered bread or cracker crumbs and browned in the oven, the result is\r\neven more pleasing.\r\n\r\nSuch a sauce flavored with cheese makes a good and very nutritious gravy\r\nto pour over cauliflower and cabbage or to serve with boiled rice or\r\nhominy or poured over toast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CREAMED VEGETABLES\r\n\r\nIn creaming vegetables the proportion is usually 1 cup of sauce to 2\r\ncups of vegetables. _Potatoes_, _asparagus_, _cauliflower_, _boiled\r\nonions_, _beans_, and _carrots_, _beets_ or _peas_ are all delicious\r\nserved in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Eggs and Asparagus=\r\n\r\nCream asparagus. Arrange in a baking dish, alternate layers of the\r\nasparagus and slices of hard boiled eggs. Cover with buttered crumbs and\r\nbake till crumbs are a delicate brown.\r\n\r\n=Souffles.=—Souffles are always delightful, and while many consider them\r\ndifficult to make they are really very simple and if made correctly are\r\nalways to be depended upon. They should, however, be eaten at once when\r\nbaked.\r\n\r\n_Salmon_, _chicken_, _lamb_, _veal_, _ham_ and _cheese_, and also many\r\nvegetables such as _asparagus_, _cauliflower_ and _peas_ may be prepared\r\nin this way. Elaborate recipes are often given, but the following is\r\nentirely sufficient and always satisfactory:\r\n\r\n    2 cups chopped meat or vegetables cut fine\r\n    2 cups thick white sauce\r\n    Yolks of 2 eggs\r\n    Whites of 2 eggs\r\n\r\nTo the meat or vegetables add white sauce (2 tablespoons butter and 3\r\ntablespoons flour to 1 cup milk) and beaten yolks. Cool and add whites\r\nbeaten stiff. Bake 30 minutes in moderate oven. This makes a dish large\r\nenough to serve four or five persons.\r\n\r\nA similar dish, Cheese Fondu, is also good, and can stand longer than a\r\nsouffle before serving.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Cheese Fondu=\r\n\r\n                          2 cups milk\r\n                          2 cups minced cheese\r\n                          1 cup bread crumbs\r\n                          2 eggs beaten\r\n\r\nBake in a hot oven for twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nVariations of this dish are made by substituting one cup minced ham for\r\none cup of the cheese, or by using two cups of ham and omitting the\r\ncheese altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MILK TOAST\r\n\r\nA very good way to serve milk toast is to toast bread thoroughly and to\r\npour hot milk over it at the time of serving. In serving milk toast in\r\nthis way all the dishes should be kept very hot. A heavy earthenware\r\npitcher may be used for serving the hot milk, as it retains heat for a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          EGGS POACHED IN MILK\r\n\r\nEggs are much better poached in milk than in water. If served on toast\r\nthe hot milk may be poured on the egg if a soft toast is desired. If\r\nnot, dip the eggs out of the milk with a perforated spoon and lay on the\r\ntoast in the usual way, adding salt and butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   CHEESE DISHES AS MEAT SUBSTITUTES\r\n\r\nMeat is wholesome and relished by most persons, yet it is not essential\r\nto a well-balanced meal, and there are many housekeepers who, for one\r\nreason or another, are interested in lessening the amount of meat which\r\nthey provide or to substitute some other foods for it.\r\n\r\nCheese naturally suggests itself as a substitute for meat, since it is\r\nrich in the same kinds of nutrients which meat supplies, is a staple\r\nfood with which everyone is familiar, and is one which can be used in a\r\ngreat variety of ways. In substituting cheese for meat, pains should be\r\ntaken to serve dishes which are relished by members of the family. A\r\nnumber of recipes for dishes which are made with cheese follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Cheese Soup=\r\n\r\n                        1 qt. milk\r\n                        1 onion grated\r\n                        1 blade mace\r\n                        2 tablespoons butter\r\n                        2 tablespoons flour\r\n                        ½ c. grated cheese\r\n                        2 egg yolks\r\n                        1 teaspoon salt\r\n                        ¼ teaspoon white pepper\r\n\r\nScald milk, onion, mace and pepper pod. Melt butter in saucepan, blend\r\nflour with melted butter. Strain milk and seasonings and add gradually\r\nto flour mixture, stirring all the time. Return to double boiler to\r\ncook. When creamy, add the cheese, salt and pepper, stirring until\r\ncheese is melted. Then pour over well-beaten egg yolks, stirring all the\r\ntime. Whip until frothing and serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Delmonico Potatoes=\r\n\r\nArrange creamed potatoes and grated cheese in alternate layers. Cover\r\nwith buttered crumbs and bake till crumbs are brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =Stuffed Potatoes with Cheese=\r\n\r\nSplit hot baked potatoes lengthwise and remove contents without injuring\r\nskin of potato. Put potato through ricer or mash, add salt and pepper to\r\ntaste and enough hot milk to make of proper consistency. Beat until\r\nlight, refill the skin, piling up lightly. Sprinkle thickly with grated\r\ncheese and reheat in oven until cheese is melted and a delicate brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Macaroni with Cheese=\r\n\r\n                 1 cup macaroni\r\n                 2 qts. boiling salted water\r\n                 2 cups white sauce\r\n                 1 cup grated cheese\r\n                 1 cup buttered bread or cracker crumbs\r\n\r\nBreak macaroni into one-inch pieces. Cook in boiling water until tender.\r\n(If macaroni is put in a wire basket in kettle, it will not stick to the\r\nkettle.) Drain and run cold water through it.\r\n\r\nMake sauce:\r\n\r\n                          2 tablespoons butter\r\n                          2 tablespoons flour\r\n                          1 teaspoon salt\r\n                          2 cups milk\r\n\r\nAdd cheese and macaroni. Cover with crumbs and bake until crumbs are\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =Rice Baked with Cheese=\r\n\r\n                   1 cup rice\r\n                   2 qts. boiling salted water\r\n                   ½ lb. grated cheese\r\n                   Milk\r\n                   Buttered crumbs (bread or cracker)\r\n\r\nAdd rice to boiling water.

For lesser amounts, measurements to be divided\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nTake 1 gallon of sweet skim milk; add ¾ cup of clean, sour milk and stir\r\nas it is put in. Raise the temperature in hot water to 75 degrees\r\nFahrenheit, using a dairy thermometer. Remove from heat and place where\r\nit is to remain until set. Add ⅛ of a junket tablet thoroughly dissolved\r\nin a tablespoon of cold water; stir while adding. Cover with cloth and\r\nleave for 12 to 16 hours in even temperature, about 75 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. At end of this period there should be a slight whey on the\r\ntop and when poured out the curd should cleave sharply. Drain through\r\ncotton cloth, not cheese-cloth. When whey has been drained out, work in\r\n1 or 2 teaspoons of salt to the cheese, according to taste; 1½ to 2\r\npounds of cheese should be obtained from a gallon of milk.\r\n\r\nFor table use it is advisable to work in 1 or 2 tablespoons of cream to\r\nthe pound. For use in cooking, this is not necessary.\r\n\r\nOne may also make cottage cheese of freshly soured milk by simply\r\nheating it in a double boiler till whey forms, letting it stand an hour\r\nand then turning it into a cheese-cloth bag to drain. To the dry curd\r\nformed add sweet or sour cream and salt to taste. When made in this way\r\ncare must be taken that the milk is freshly soured—if it is old it will\r\nhave a bitter taste and the cheese will not be good.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      =Cottage Cheese Sandwiches=\r\n\r\nThin slices of rye, brown or white bread, buttered, with fillings of\r\ncottage cheese in combination with jelly, marmalade, pimentoes, lettuce\r\nor mayonnaise are all good.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =Cottage Cheese Club Sandwiches=\r\n\r\nToast slices of bread, cut diamond shape and spread with butter and\r\ncottage cheese or cottage cheese alone and put together with any one of\r\nthe following combinations:\r\n\r\nTomato, lettuce and mayonnaise dressing.\r\n\r\nThin slices of ham spread with mustard and lettuce.\r\n\r\nSliced, tart apple, chopped nuts and drops of French dressing.\r\n\r\nSliced orange and mayonnaise.\r\n\r\nSliced Spanish onion, a hot fried egg sprinkled with Worcestershire\r\nsauce.\r\n\r\nThin slices of tomato, bacon, chicken, lettuce and mayonnaise dressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =Cottage Cheese Salad Dressing=\r\n\r\n        ½ cup cottage cheese\r\n        1 tablespoon vinegar\r\n        ½ teaspoon sugar\r\n        ¼ teaspoon salt\r\n        1 cup heavy cream (either sweet or sour) whipped stiff.\r\n\r\nMix in order given.

To prevent scum from forming, cover with a perforated tin\r\nor sprinkle with granulated sugar when cooling.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  =Blanc Mange or Cornstarch Pudding=\r\n\r\n                            1 qt. milk\r\n                            ½ cup cornstarch\r\n                            Pinch of salt\r\n                            3 eggs\r\n                            ½ cup sugar\r\n\r\nHeat milk to boiling, add cornstarch dissolved in a little cold milk and\r\na pinch of salt. Boil five minutes, add yolks of eggs beaten with sugar.\r\nBoil 2 minutes longer, remove from fire and beat in the whipped whites\r\nof eggs. Flavor with vanilla or lemon. Serve cold with cream and sugar\r\nor canned peaches or pears.\r\n\r\nThis is used also as a filling for cream pie, using the beaten whites of\r\neggs, sweetened for a meringue and browning slightly in oven. Bake the\r\ncrust before filling with the cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Baked Custard=\r\n\r\n                          4 cups scalded milk\r\n                          4 eggs\r\n                          ½ cup sugar\r\n                          ¼ teaspoon salt\r\n                          Few gratings nutmeg\r\n\r\nBeat eggs slightly, add sugar and salt, pour on slowly scalded milk,\r\nstrain in buttered mold, set in pan of hot water. Sprinkle with nutmeg\r\nand bake in slow oven until firm, which may be readily determined by\r\nrunning a silver knife through custard. If knife comes out clean,\r\ncustard is done. During baking care must be taken that water surrounding\r\nmold does not reach boiling point or custard will whey. Always bear in\r\nmind that eggs and milk combination must be cooked at a low temperature.\r\nFor cup custards allow three eggs to four cups milk; for large molded\r\ncustard four or five eggs; if fewer eggs are used, custard is liable to\r\ncrack when turned on a serving dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =Baked Apple, Southern Style=\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                           6 choice apples\r\n                           ½ cup sugar\r\n                           1 qt. milk\r\n                           Salt\r\n                           4 eggs\r\n                           ⅔ cup sugar\r\n                           1 teaspoon vanilla\r\n\r\nPare and core apples that are not too sour to hold their shape when\r\nbaked. Put in a pudding dish, sprinkle the half cupful of sugar over and\r\naround them, also filling place where the core was taken out. Put in\r\noven and bake. Remove from oven and pour around them the milk mixture\r\nmade thus: Beat the eggs well, add sugar and beat again, add milk, salt\r\nand vanilla. Bake slowly until a knife-blade will come out clean after\r\ninsertion in the custard. Serve hot or cold, with or without whipped\r\ncream. This is an especially good dessert for children.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Coffee Custard=\r\n\r\n                          2 cups milk\r\n                          1 cup strong coffee\r\n                          3 eggs\r\n                          ¼ cup sugar\r\n                          ⅛ teaspoon salt\r\n                          ¼ teaspoon vanilla\r\n\r\nBeat eggs slightly; add sugar, salt, vanilla, milk and coffee.

Add gradually to milk,\r\nbeing careful that milk does not bubble up and go over, as is liable on\r\naccount of high temperature of sugar. As soon as sugar is melted in\r\nmilk, add mixture gradually to eggs slightly beaten, add salt and\r\nflavoring, then strain in buttered mold. Bake as custard. Chill and\r\nserve with caramel sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Rice Pudding=\r\n\r\n 1 qt. milk\r\n ⅓ cup rice\r\n ½ teaspoon salt\r\n ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or cinnamon, or grated rind of ¼ of a lemon\r\n\r\nWash the rice thoroughly, mix the ingredients and bake three hours or\r\nmore in a very slow oven, stirring occasionally at first.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Tapioca Custard=\r\n\r\nAdd to the list of ingredients for boiled custard ¼ cup of pearl\r\ntapioca. Soak the tapioca in water for an hour or two, drain it, and\r\ncook in the milk until it is transparent. Proceed as for boiled custard.\r\n\r\n\r\n                GENERAL RECIPE FOR CEREAL-MILK PUDDINGS\r\n\r\nBread and rice puddings, made with milk and eggs, are familiar to all\r\ncooks. Made without eggs, the following will be found suggestive:\r\n\r\nFor a quart of milk allow ⅓ of a cup of any coarse cereal (rice,\r\ncornmeal, cracked wheat, oatmeal or barley); add ⅓ of a cup of brown,\r\nwhite or maple sugar, syrup, honey or molasses; ½ teaspoon salt; ⅛\r\nteaspoon spice. The flavoring may be omitted when honey or molasses is\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe above recipe makes quite a large pudding. It is often convenient to\r\nmake a smaller one, and enough for a child’s dinner can be made in the\r\ndouble boiler, allowing two level or one rounding tablespoon of cereal\r\nto a cup of salted and flavored milk. Cook an hour and sweeten slightly.\r\n\r\nThese puddings, if made thin, may be poured over stewed prunes or other\r\ncooked fruits, and are a good and economical substitute for the cream or\r\nsoft custard usually used for that purpose.\r\n\r\nA very old recipe for a baked corn pudding has recently been given to\r\nthe author.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Indian Meal Custard=\r\n\r\n                 1 pt. sweet milk, when hot add slowly\r\n                 ½ cup cornmeal\r\n                 Pinch salt\r\n                 ½ teaspoon each cinnamon and ginger\r\n                 Sugar to taste\r\n                 1 tablespoon molasses\r\n                 Boil 5 minutes, and add\r\n                 2 beaten eggs\r\n                 1 pt. milk\r\n                 Bake about one-half hour or till set.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =Milk and Fruit Mold[11]=\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Milk and fruit mold\r\n]\r\n\r\n                3½ cups hot milk,\r\n                ½ cup cold milk,\r\n                5 tablespoons granulated sugar\r\n                10 tablespoons cornstarch\r\n                2 beaten egg whites\r\n                1 teaspoon almond extract,\r\n                ½ teaspoon salt\r\n                Candied cherries, cut into small pieces\r\n\r\nHeat milk in double boiler. Mix cornstarch with cold milk, stir it into\r\nthe hot milk, add salt and sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10\r\nminutes. Remove from fire, fold in the beaten whites and add the\r\nflavoring. Rinse mold in cold water, drain, pour in part of the cooked\r\nmixture, add a layer of cherries and continue until mold is filled. Set\r\non ice to chill.

Remove from fire, add grated rind and\r\nbeaten eggs and mix well.\r\n\r\nPut the cup of sugar in a small saucepan over the fire and stir\r\nconstantly until it is a golden brown liquid. Have a mold heating, and\r\nwhen very hot pour the liquid in it, turning the mold so that all parts\r\nare coated. Turn the rice into the mold and set it in a pan of water in\r\na hot oven for 20 minutes, having the mold covered the entire time.\r\n\r\nRemove from oven, let stand until cold, unmold and serve with the\r\ncaramel sauce that is in the mold.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Milk Cream=[11]\r\n\r\n                      1½ cups hot milk\r\n                      ½ cup cold milk\r\n                      ⅜ cup granulated sugar\r\n                      3 eggs\r\n                      ½ ounce granulated gelatine\r\n                      1 teaspoon vanilla\r\n                      Pinch of salt\r\n\r\nSoak gelatine in the cold milk for 10 minutes. Heat balance of milk in a\r\ndouble boiler, add salt, sugar and beaten yolks, stirring constantly.\r\nCook until mixture coats the spoon, remove from fire, add soaked\r\ngelatine and stir until dissolved. Then set aside to cool and when\r\nbeginning to thicken add flavoring and mix in lightly the stiffly beaten\r\nwhites.\r\n\r\nRinse a mold in cold water, drain, pour in mixture and set in a cold\r\nplace until firm.

Turn into glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Buttermilk Lemonade=\r\n\r\nA variation may be made from ordinary buttermilk by the addition of\r\nlemon juice and sugar. “Buttermilk lemonade” usually requires the juice\r\nof three lemons to one quart of buttermilk. The quantity of lemon and\r\nsugar, however, should be varied to suit the taste of the individual.\r\nThe beverage is delightful and is especially refreshing on a hot summer\r\nday.\r\n\r\nOne may also use the juice of two oranges and one lemon to one quart of\r\nbuttermilk, instead of the lemons alone.\r\n\r\nMany people like the clear buttermilk slightly sweetened with a few\r\ngrains of salt added.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =Chocolate=\r\n\r\n                          1½ squares chocolate\r\n                          4 tablespoons sugar\r\n                          Few grains salt\r\n                          1 cup boiling water\r\n                          3 cups milk\r\n                          ½ teaspoon vanilla\r\n\r\nScald milk. Melt chocolate in small saucepan and gradually add boiling\r\nwater. When smooth add to scalded milk, sweeten and add salt and\r\nvanilla.

Cook 15 minutes, add vanilla and salt. Serve with whipped\r\ncream. A famous cook known to the writer adds 1 teaspoon cornstarch\r\ndissolved in 1 tablespoon cold water to the cocoa when nearly ready for\r\nthe table. It adds to the apparent richness of the beverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MISCELLANEOUS SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. A tablespoonful of milk put in the pan before frying eggs will keep\r\nthem tender.\r\n\r\n2. Covering cold chicken or other meat with buttermilk will keep it for\r\ntwenty-four hours or more, without affecting the meat except to make it\r\nmore tender.\r\n\r\n3. Custards and ice cream kept too long in warm weather may cause\r\nptomaine poisoning.\r\n\r\n4. Keep milk covered to shut out flavors from other food.\r\n\r\n5. Milk warm from the cow should not be kept in a closed receptacle.\r\n\r\n6. Danish cooks soak a piece of veal in skim milk overnight before\r\nroasting it, to improve the flavor.\r\n\r\n7. Sliced ham covered with milk and baked in a moderate oven for an hour\r\nhas delicate flavor and is always tender.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE THERMOMETER\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Dairy and household thermometers\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the United States and Canada as well as in England _Fahrenheit’s_\r\nthermometer is generally used according to which water freezes at 32°\r\nand boils at 212° at ordinary air pressure, leaving 180 degrees between\r\nthe freezing and the boiling point. In some countries in Europe\r\nRéaumur’s thermometer is used with 0° for the freezing point and 80° for\r\nboiling. In France and for scientific work in all countries, however,\r\nthe Celsius or Centigrade system is employed for measuring heat and\r\ncold, having 0° for freezing and 100° for boiling. As there are 180°\r\nFahrenheit, 80° Réaumur and 100° Centigrade between freezing and\r\nboiling, the divisions are therefore as 9° F. to 4° R. and 5° C.\r\n\r\nTo change from degrees of F. above the freezing point to the other\r\nsystems deduct 32, divide the remainder by 9 and multiply by 4 or by 5\r\nrespectively. To change from C. to F. divide by 5, multiply by 9 and add\r\n32, etc. As the metric system is gradually being introduced everywhere\r\ninstead of the old systems for weights and measures, so also is the\r\nCentigrade thermometer being substituted for the others and in cookery\r\nit may soon be used exclusively.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WEIGHTS AND MEASURES\r\n\r\n    1 pound = 16 ounces = 453.6 grams\r\n    1 ounce = 16 drams = 28.35 grams\r\n    1 kilogram = 1000 grams = 2.2 pounds\r\n    1 gram = 15.43 grains = .035 ounces\r\n\r\n    1 gallon = 4 quarts = 3.785 liters\r\n    1 quart = 2 pints =.9464 liters\r\n    1 pint = 16 fluid ounces = .4731 liters\r\n    1 fluid ounce = 8 drams = 29.57 c.c.\r\n    1 liter = 1000 cubic centimeters = 1.0567 quarts\r\n\r\n    1 mile = 5280 feet = 1.6 kilometer\r\n    1 foot = 12 inches = .3048 meter\r\n    1 kilometer = 1000 meters = .6214 mile\r\n    1 meter = 100 centimeters = 39.37 inches\r\n\r\n    1 acre = 43,560 sq. ft. = .4047 hectare\r\n    1 sq. ft. = 144 sq. inches = 9.29 sq. decimeters\r\n    1 hectare = 10,000 sq. meters = 2.471 acres\r\n    1 square meter = 100 sq. decimeters = 10.764 sq. ft.\r\n    1 bushel = 4 pecks = .3552 hectoliter\r\n    1 hectoliter = 2.8377 bushels\r\n\r\n    1 U.

The quantity thus measured off is 17.6 c.c. The\r\n  pipette is then emptied into the _test bottle_ by placing the point in\r\n  the neck and allowing the milk to flow slowly down the inside of the\r\n  neck, taking care not to lose any of the milk. Blow the last drops out\r\n  of the pipette into the bottle.\r\n\r\n  The _measuring glass_, holding 17.5 c.c., is filled to the mark with\r\n  _sulphuric acid_ of a specific gravity of 1.82 to 1.83 and this is\r\n  poured into the milk in the test bottle. The acid is a strong poison\r\n  and must be handled with care. Pour it slowly down along the wall of\r\n  the bottle which is held at an angle and turned slowly during the\r\n  operation.\r\n\r\n  Now give the bottle a rotary motion to thoroughly mix the milk and the\r\n  acid, shaking vigorously towards the end of the operation so as to be\r\n  sure not to leave any of the acid which is heavier than the milk at\r\n  the bottom of the bottle.\r\n\r\n  _Whirling._—The bottles are then placed in the centrifugal machine and\r\n  whirled for five minutes at the proper speed—from 600 to 1200\r\n  revolutions per minute—according to the diameter of the machine and as\r\n  stated in the directions which come with the tester. The mixture of\r\n  milk and acid is hot enough if the whirling is done at once, but if it\r\n  is allowed to cool the bottles should be placed in hot water of 150 to\r\n  170° for about 15 minutes; whirling at full speed for 4 minutes brings\r\n  all the fat to the top.\r\n\r\n  Hot water is now added until the bottle is filled almost to the scale\r\n  on the neck and the bottles are again placed in the machine and\r\n  whirled at full speed for one minute. Hot water is then again added\r\n  until the lower end of the fat column is within the scale, preferably\r\n  at the 1% or 2% mark on the neck of the bottle. Whirl once more for\r\n  one or two minutes and then read off the percentage of fat on the\r\n  scale. Each division represents 0.2% fat. The fat column is measured\r\n  from the lower line between the fat and the water to the point where\r\n  the top of the fat column touches the wall of the neck. A pair of\r\n  dividers are handy for measuring the fat column and reading off the\r\n  percentage of fat in the milk. The bottle with contents should be\r\n  warm—about 140°—when the measure is taken.\r\n\r\n  For testing skim milk and cream special forms of test bottles are\r\n  used—which are described in the circulars coming with the testers and\r\n  students who desire fuller information are referred to Farrington and\r\n  Woll’s “Testing Milk and its Products,” published by the Mendota Book\r\n  Co., Madison, Wis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  The _Acid Test_ depends upon what in the laboratory is called\r\n  “titration” and makes use of a “burette,” a long, graduated measuring\r\n  tube provided with a pinch-cock. This burette is filled with an alkali\r\n  solution of known strength, usually a “tenth normal” solution of\r\n  caustic soda. A certain amount of the milk to be tested is measured\r\n  off into a glass or a white porcelain cup. As a 17.6 c.c. pipette\r\n  belonging to the Babcock test usually is at hand, that may be used for\r\n  this purpose. A few drops of an _Indicator_ is added to the milk and\r\n  under constant stirring the soda solution is allowed to drip into it\r\n  until suddenly it turns pink. The color will quickly disappear,\r\n  however, and a few more drops of the alkali are added and stirred in\r\n  several times until a faint but distinct pink color remains for some\r\n  time. That indicates that the acid in the milk has been neutralized\r\n  and the amount of the soda solution consumed is then read off on the\r\n  scale on the burette. By dividing the number of c.c. of the soda\r\n  solution used by two, the tenths per cent of lactic acid in the milk\r\n  is found. For example, if it takes 4 c.c. of the soda solution to\r\n  neutralize 17.6 c.c. milk, the acidity is .2%. This depends upon the\r\n  fact that 1 c.c. of a tenth normal soda neutralizes .009 gram of\r\n  lactic acid and that therefore the per cent of acid in the milk is\r\n  equal to .009 multiplied by the number of c.c. of soda solution used,\r\n  divided by the number of c.c. of milk and multiplied by 100.\r\n\r\n  If 50 c.c. of milk is taken instead of 17.6 the calculation is changed\r\n  accordingly.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Farmers’ Bulletin No. 602, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  _Butter Color_ is made of the coloring matter of “Annatto” dissolved\r\n  in a refined vegetable (salad) oil. The Annatto tree (Bixa Orelana)\r\n  grows in the tropics and the seed which has a thin coating of this\r\n  beautiful coloring matter comes mostly from the West Indian Islands,\r\n  Jamaica, Porto Rico and Guadeloupe. It is perfectly harmless and is\r\n  used by the natives to flavor and color soup and other foods much as\r\n  we use tomatoes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  The Marschall Rennet Test consists of a graduated cup (a) with a fine\r\n  hole for an outlet in the bottom. One cubic centimeter of a standard\r\n  rennet extract is diluted with water in the glass bottle (c). The cup\r\n  is filled with milk and placed on the corner of the cheese vat, the\r\n  milk being allowed to run through the fine hole in the bottom of the\r\n  cup. The moment the surface of the milk reaches the upper mark of the\r\n  graduation in the cup the diluted rennet extract is added and quickly\r\n  stirred into the milk with the spattle (d).\r\n\r\n  When the milk begins to curdle it stops running out. The sweeter the\r\n  milk is the more will run out before coagulation stops it and the mark\r\n  on the scale at which it stops indicates the degree of acidity or\r\n  ripening. The point is to have the milk alike every day and if, for\r\n  instance, the cheesemaker has found that his cheese is best if he adds\r\n  the rennet to the milk in the vat when the test shows 2½, he wants to\r\n  ripen the milk to that degree every day. So, if the test shows 3 or 4,\r\n  it indicates that the milk is not sufficiently ripened and it should\r\n  be allowed to stand warm for a longer time before it is set with\r\n  rennet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  The Acidemeter for making an Acid Test is described in Chapter I.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Rennet (see under “Ferments” in Chapter I) is prepared from the third\r\n  division of the stomach of the suckling or milk-fed calf. Fifty years\r\n  ago cheesemakers used to make their own rennet by soaking salted\r\n  calves’ stomachs in sour whey, and our grandmothers used a piece of a\r\n  dry, salted stomach to make Junket or “Curds and Whey.” About 1868,\r\n  Christian Hansen, of Copenhagen, Denmark, began the preparation of\r\n  Commercial Rennet Extract which soon supplanted the home-made rennet\r\n  in all countries wherever cheese was made. Nowadays rennet in liquid\r\n  or powder or tablet form for cheesemaking, and Junket Tablets for milk\r\n  puddings, are prepared pure and of known strength in laboratories and\r\n  handled by druggists and dealers in dairy supplies.\r\n\r\n  The fresh stomachs are saved by the farmers or butchers and are either\r\n  blown up and dried in the air protected from sunlight and rain, or\r\n  split lengthwise and spread out flat and salted on both sides.\r\n\r\n  In the laboratory the ferment is extracted by chemicals and a pure,\r\n  clear liquid extract is prepared, of uniform strength and good keeping\r\n  quality. Or the extract is condensed into a powder which again is\r\n  compressed into tablets of great strength.\r\n\r\n  The ferment acts best when the milk is lukewarm, but it will do the\r\n  work at temperatures ranging from 50°, or even lower, to 120° F.\r\n  Strongly pasteurized or sterilized milk will not curdle with rennet,\r\n  but milk pasteurized at a low temperature is not changed enough to\r\n  prevent it from making a firm curd. More rennet does not make a firmer\r\n  curd but causes the milk to curdle quicker; less rennet makes the\r\n  process slower. Diluted milk will not curdle firmly, and the failure\r\n  of milk to make a smooth coagulum of the usual consistency and in the\r\n  usual time, the temperature being right and the regular amount of a\r\n  standard rennet being used, is a never-failing proof that something is\r\n  the matter with the milk. It has been changed from its natural\r\n  condition by over-heating in pasteurization or by watering or\r\n  doctoring, or it has not been properly ripened.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  W. O.

Such has been Professor Wing’s purpose in this\r\nwork. This is not a new edition of the author’s very successful volume\r\npublished under the same title many years ago; it is, in reality, an\r\nentirely new book, having been wholly reset and enlarged by the addition\r\nof new matter, both text and illustrations.
