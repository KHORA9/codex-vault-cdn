I offer no apology\r\ntherefore for attempting to throw into the form of a book accessible\r\nto general readers, what is known as to the dawn of life, and cannot\r\ndoubt that the present work will meet with at least as much acceptance\r\nas that in which I recently endeavoured to picture the whole series of\r\nthe geological ages.\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge my obligations to Sir W. E. Logan for most\r\nof the Laurentian geology in the second chapter, and also for the\r\nbeautiful map which he has kindly had prepared at his own expense as\r\na contribution to the work. To Dr. Carpenter I am indebted for much\r\ninformation as to foraminiferal structures, and to Dr. Hunt for the\r\nchemistry of the subject. Mr. Selwyn, Director of the Geological\r\nSurvey of Canada, has kindly given me access to the materials in its\r\ncollections. Mr. Billings has contributed specimens and illustrations\r\nof Palæozoic Protozoa; and Mr. Weston has aided greatly by the\r\npreparation of slices for the microscope, and of photographs, as well\r\nas by assistance in collecting.\r\n\r\n                                                               J.

Yet few even of those\r\nto whom the name is familiar, know how much it implies, and how strange\r\nand wonderful is the story which can be evoked from this first-born of\r\nold ocean.\r\n\r\nNo one probably believes that animal life has been an eternal\r\nsuccession of like forms of being. We are familiar with the idea that\r\nin some way it was introduced; and most men now know, either from the\r\ntestimony of Genesis or geology, or of both, that the lower forms\r\nof animal life were introduced first, and that these first living\r\ncreatures had their birth in the waters, which are still the prolific\r\nmother of living things innumerable. Further, there is a general\r\nimpression that it would be the most appropriate way that the great\r\nprocession of animal existence should commence with the humblest types\r\nknown to us, and should march on in successive bands of gradually\r\nincreasing dignity and power, till man himself brings up the rear.\r\n\r\nDo we know the first animal? Can we name it, explain its structure,\r\nand state its relations to its successors? Can we do this by inference\r\nfrom the succeeding types of being; and if so, do our anticipations\r\nagree with any actual reality disinterred from the earth's crust? If we\r\ncould do this, either by inference or actual discovery, how strange it\r\nwould be to know that we had before us even the remains of the first\r\ncreature that could feel or will, and could place itself in vital\r\nrelation with the great powers of inanimate nature. If we believe in a\r\nCreator, we shall feel it a solemn thing to have access to the first\r\ncreature into which He breathed the breath of life. If we hold that all\r\nthings have been evolved from collision of dead forces, then the first\r\nmolecules of matter which took upon themselves the responsibility of\r\nliving, and, aiming at the enjoyment of happiness, subjected themselves\r\nto the dread alternatives of pain and mortality, must surely evoke\r\nfrom us that filial reverence which we owe to the authors of our own\r\nbeing, if they do not involuntarily draw forth even a superstitious\r\nadoration. The veneration of the old Egyptian for his sacred animals\r\nwould be a comparatively reasonable idolatry, if we could imagine any\r\nof these animals to have been the first that emerged from the domain\r\nof dead matter, and the first link in a reproductive chain of being\r\nthat produced all the population of the world. Independently of any\r\nsuch hypotheses, all students of nature must regard with surpassing\r\ninterest the first bright streaks of light that break on the long reign\r\nof primeval night and death, and presage the busy day of teeming animal\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nNo wonder then that geologists have long and earnestly groped in the\r\nrocky archives of the earth in search of some record of this patriarch\r\nof the animal kingdom. But after long and patient research, there still\r\nremained a large residuum of the oldest rocks, destitute of all traces\r\nof living beings, and designated by the hopeless name \"Azoic,\"--the\r\nformations destitute of remains of life, the stony records of a\r\nlifeless world. So the matter remained till the Laurentian rocks of\r\nCanada, lying at the base of these old Azoic formations, afforded\r\nforms believed to be of organic origin. The discovery was hailed\r\nwith enthusiasm by those who had been prepared by previous study to\r\nreceive it. It was regarded with feeble and not very intelligent faith\r\nby many more, and was met with half-concealed or open scepticism by\r\nothers. It produced a copious crop of descriptive and controversial\r\nliterature, but for the most part technical, and confined to scientific\r\ntransactions and periodicals, read by very few except specialists.\r\nThus, few even of geological and biological students have clear ideas\r\nof the real nature and mode of occurrence of these ancient organisms,\r\nand of their relations to better known forms of life; while the crudest\r\nand most inaccurate ideas have been current in lectures and popular\r\nbooks, and even in text-books, although to the minds of those really\r\nacquainted with the facts, all the disputed points have long ago been\r\nsatisfactorily settled, and the true nature and affinities of Eozoon\r\nare distinctly and satisfactorily understood.\r\n\r\nThis state of things has long ceased to be desirable in the interests\r\nof science, since the settlement of the questions raised is in the\r\nhighest degree important to the history of life. We cannot, it is true,\r\naffirm that Eozoon is in reality the long sought prototype of animal\r\nexistence; but it is for us at present the last organic foothold, on\r\nwhich we can poise ourselves, that we may look back into the abyss\r\nof the infinite past, and forward to the long and varied progress of\r\nlife in geological time. Its consideration, therefore, is certain,\r\nif properly entered into, to be fruitful of interesting and valuable\r\nthought, and to form the best possible introduction to the history of\r\nlife in connection with geology.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons, and because I have been connected with this\r\ngreat discovery from the first, and have for the last ten years given\r\nto it an amount of labour and attention far greater than could be\r\nadequately represented by short and technical papers, that I have\r\nplanned the present work. In it I propose to give a popular, yet\r\nas far as possible accurate, account of all that is known of the\r\nDawn-animal of the Laurentian rocks of Canada. This will include,\r\nfirstly: a descriptive notice of the Laurentian formation itself.\r\nSecondly: a history of the steps which led to the discovery and proper\r\ninterpretation of this ancient fossil. Thirdly: the description of\r\nEozoon, and the explanation of the manner in which its remains have\r\nbeen preserved. Fourthly: inquiries as to forms of animal life, its\r\ncontemporaries and immediate successors, or allied to it by zoological\r\naffinity. Fifthly: the objections which have been urged against its\r\norganic nature. And sixthly: the summing up of the lessons in science\r\nwhich it is fitted to teach. On these points, while I shall endeavour\r\nto state the substance of all that has been previously published, I\r\nshall bring forward many new facts illustrative of points hitherto more\r\nor less obscure, and shall endeavour so to picture these in themselves\r\nand their relations, as to give distinct and vivid impressions to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who may not have access to the original\r\nmemoirs, or may not have time to consult them, I shall append to the\r\nseveral chapters some of the technical details. These may be omitted by\r\nthe general reader; but will serve to make the work more complete and\r\nuseful as a book of reference.\r\n\r\nThe only preparation necessary for the unscientific reader of this\r\nwork, will be some little knowledge of the division of geological time\r\ninto successive ages, as represented by the diagram of formations\r\nappended to this chapter, and more full explanations may be obtained by\r\nconsulting any of the numerous elementary manuals on geology, or \"The\r\nStory of the Earth and Man,\" by the writer of the present work.\r\n\r\nTABULAR VIEW OF THE EARTH'S GEOLOGICAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n  _Animal Kingdom._     _Geological Periods._          _Vegetable Kingdom._\r\n\r\n  Age of Man.

These rocks, at one time known as Azoic,\r\nbeing supposed destitute of all remains of living things, but now more\r\nproperly Eozoic, are those in which the first bright streaks of the\r\ndawn of life make their appearance.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Dana has recently proposed the term \"_Archæan_,\" on the\r\nground that some of these rocks are as yet unfossiliferous but as the\r\noldest known part of them contains fossils, there seems no need for\r\nthis new name.]\r\n\r\nThe name Laurentian, given originally to the Canadian development of\r\nthese rocks by Sir William Logan, but now applied to them throughout\r\nthe world, is derived from a range of hills lying north of the\r\nSt. Lawrence valley, which the old French geographers named the\r\nLaurentides. In these hills the harder rocks of this old formation\r\nrise to considerable heights, and form the highlands separating the\r\nSt. Lawrence valley from the great plain fronting on Hudson's Bay\r\nand the Arctic Sea. At first sight it may seem strange that rocks so\r\nancient should anywhere appear at the surface, especially on the tops\r\nof hills; but this is a necessary result of the mode of formation of\r\nour continents. The most ancient sediments deposited in the sea were\r\nthose first elevated into land, and first altered and hardened by heat.\r\nUpheaved in the folding of the earth's crust into high and rugged\r\nridges, they have either remained uncovered with newer sediments, or\r\nhave had such as were deposited on them washed away; and being of a\r\nhard and resisting nature, they have remained comparatively unworn when\r\nrocks much more modern have been swept off by denuding agencies.\r\n\r\nBut the exposure of the old Laurentian skeleton of mother earth is not\r\nconfined to the Laurentide Hills, though these have given the formation\r\nits name. The same ancient rocks appear in the Adirondack mountains\r\nof New York, and in the patches which at lower levels protrude from\r\nbeneath the newer formations along the American coast from Newfoundland\r\nto Maryland. The older gneisses of Norway, Sweden, and the Hebrides,\r\nof Bavaria and Bohemia, belong to the same age, and it is not unlikely\r\nthat similar rocks in many other parts of the old continent will be\r\nfound to be of as great antiquity. In no part of the world, however,\r\nare the Laurentian rocks more extensively distributed or better\r\nknown than in North America; and to this as the grandest and most\r\ninstructive development of them, and that which first afforded organic\r\nremains, we may more especially devote our attention. Their general\r\nrelations to the other formations of America may be learned from the\r\nrough generalised section (fig. 1); in which the crumpled and contorted\r\nLaurentian strata of Canada are seen to underlie unconformably the\r\ncomparatively flat Silurian beds, which are themselves among the oldest\r\nmonuments of the geological history of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. _General Section, showing the Relations of\r\nthe Laurentian and Palæozoic Rocks in Canada._ (L.) Laurentian. (1.)\r\nCambrian, or Primordial. (2.) Lower Silurian. (3.) Upper Silurian. (4.)\r\nDevonian and Carboniferous.]\r\n\r\nThe Laurentian rocks, associated with another series only a little\r\nyounger, the Huronian, form a great belt of broken and hilly country,\r\nextending from Labrador across the north of Canada to Lake Superior,\r\nand thence bending northward to the Arctic Sea. Everywhere on the lower\r\nSt. Lawrence they appear as ranges of billowy rounded ridges on the\r\nnorth side of the river; and as viewed from the water or the southern\r\nshore, especially when sunset deepens their tints to blue and violet,\r\nthey present a grand and massive appearance, which, in the eye of\r\nthe geologist, who knows that they have endured the battles and the\r\nstorms of time longer than any other mountains, invests them with a\r\ndignity which their mere elevation would fail to give. (Fig. 2.) In the\r\nisolated mass of the Adirondacks, south of the Canadian frontier, they\r\nrise to a still greater elevation, and form an imposing mountain group,\r\nalmost equal in height to their somewhat more modern rivals, the White\r\nMountains, which face them on the opposite side of Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\nThe grandeur of the old Laurentian ranges is, however, best displayed\r\nwhere they have been cut across by the great transverse gorge of the\r\nSaguenay, and where the magnificent precipices, known as Capes Trinity\r\nand Eternity, look down from their elevation of 1500 feet on a fiord,\r\nwhich at their base is more than 100 fathoms deep (see frontispiece).\r\nThe name Eternity applied to such a mass is geologically scarcely a\r\nmisnomer, for it dates back to the very dawn of geological time, and is\r\nof hoar antiquity in comparison with such upstart ranges as the Andes\r\nand the Alps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. _Laurentian Hills opposite Kamouraska, Lower St.\r\nLawrence._\r\n\r\nThe islands in front are Primordial.]\r\n\r\nOn a nearer acquaintance, the Laurentian country appears as a broken\r\nand hilly upland and highland district, clad in its pristine state\r\nwith magnificent forests, but affording few attractions to the\r\nagriculturist, except in the valleys, which follow the lines of its\r\nsofter beds, while it is a favourite region for the angler, the hunter,\r\nand the lumberman. Many of the Laurentian townships of Canada are,\r\nhowever, already extensively settled, and the traveller may pass\r\nthrough a succession of more or less cultivated valleys, bounded by\r\nrocks or wooded hills and crags, and diversified by running streams and\r\nromantic lakes and ponds, constituting a country always picturesque\r\nand often beautiful, and rearing a strong and hardy population. To\r\nthe geologist it presents in the main immensely thick beds of gneiss,\r\nand similar metamorphic and crystalline rocks, contorted in the most\r\nremarkable manner, so that if they could be flattened out they would\r\nserve as a skin much too large for mother earth in her present state,\r\nso much has she shrunk and wrinkled since those youthful days when the\r\nLaurentian rocks were her outer covering. (Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nThe elaborate sections of Sir William Logan show that these old rocks\r\nare divisible into two series, the Lower and Upper Laurentian; the\r\nlatter being the newer of the two, and perhaps separated from the\r\nformer by a long interval of time; but this Upper Laurentian being\r\nprobably itself older than the Huronian series, and this again older\r\nthan all the other stratified rocks. The Lower Laurentian, which\r\nattains to a thickness of more than 20,000 feet, consists of stratified\r\ngranitic rocks or gneisses, of indurated sandstone or quartzite, of\r\nmica and hornblende schist, and of crystalline limestones or marbles,\r\nand iron ores, the whole interstratified with each other. The Upper\r\nLaurentian, which is 10,000 feet thick at least, consists in part of\r\nsimilar rocks, but associated with great beds of triclinic feldspar,\r\nespecially of that peculiar variety known as labradorite, or Labrador\r\nfeldspar, and which sometimes by its wonderful iridescent play of\r\ncolours becomes a beautiful ornamental stone.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe such rocks, but their names will tell something to\r\nthose who have any knowledge of the older crystalline materials of the\r\nearth's crust. To those who have not, I would advise a visit to some\r\ncliff on the lower St. Lawrence, or the Hebridean coasts, or the shore\r\nof Norway, where the old hard crystalline and gnarled beds present\r\ntheir sharp edges to the ever raging sea, and show their endless\r\nalternations of various kinds and colours of strata often diversified\r\nwith veins and nests of crystalline minerals. He who has seen and\r\nstudied such a section of Laurentian rock cannot forget it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. _Section from Petite Nation Seigniory to St.\r\nJerome_ (60 miles). _After Sir W. E. Logan._\r\n\r\n(_a, b._) Upper Laurentian. (_c._) Fourth gneiss. (_d´._) Third\r\nlimestone. (_d._) Third gneiss. (_e´._) Second limestone. (_x._)\r\nPorphyry. (_y._) Granite.]\r\n\r\nAll the constituents of the Laurentian series are in that state known\r\nto geologists as metamorphic. They were once sandstones, clays, and\r\nlimestones, such as the sea now deposits, or such as form the common\r\nplebeian rocks of everyday plains and hills and coast sections. Being\r\nextremely old, however, they have been buried deep in the bowels of\r\nthe earth under the newer deposits, and hardened by the action of\r\npressure and of heat and heated water. Whether this heat was part\r\nof that originally belonging to the earth when a molten mass, and\r\nstill existing in its interior after aqueous rocks had begun to form\r\non its surface, or whether it is a mere mechanical effect of the\r\nintense compression which these rocks have suffered, may be a disputed\r\nquestion; but the observations of Sorby and of Hunt (the former in\r\nconnection with the microscopic structure of rocks, and the latter\r\nin connection with the chemical conditions of change) show that no\r\nvery excessive amount of heat would be required. These observations\r\nand those of Daubrée indicate that crystallization like that of the\r\nLaurentian rocks might take place at a temperature of not over 370° of\r\nthe centigrade thermometer.\r\n\r\nThe study of those partial alterations which take place in the\r\nvicinity of volcanic and older aqueous masses of rock confirms these\r\nconclusions, so that we may be said to know the precise conditions\r\nunder which sediments may be hardened into crystalline rocks, while\r\nthe bedded character and the alternations of different layers in the\r\nLaurentian rocks, as well as the indications of contemporary marine\r\nlife which they contain, show that they actually are such altered\r\nsediments. (See Note D.)\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice here that the Laurentian rocks thus\r\ninterpreted show that the oldest known portions of our continents were\r\nformed in the waters. They are oceanic sediments deposited perhaps when\r\nthere was no dry land or very little, and that little unknown to us\r\nexcept in so far as its debris may have entered into the composition\r\nof the Laurentian rocks themselves. Thus the earliest condition of the\r\nearth known to the geologist is one in which old ocean was already\r\ndominant on its surface; and any previous condition when the surface\r\nwas heated, and the water constituted an abyss of vapours enveloping\r\nits surface, or any still earlier condition in which the earth was\r\ngaseous or vaporous, is a matter of mere inference, not of actual\r\nobservation. The formless and void chaos is a deduction of chemical and\r\nphysical principles, not a fact observed by the geologist. Still we\r\nknow, from the great dykes and masses of igneous or molten rock which\r\ntraverse the Laurentian beds, that even at that early period there were\r\ndeep-seated fires beneath the crust; and it is quite possible that\r\nvolcanic agencies then manifested themselves, not only with quite as\r\ngreat intensity, but also in the same manner, as at subsequent times.\r\nIt is thus not unlikely that much of the land undergoing waste in the\r\nearlier Laurentian time was of the same nature with recent volcanic\r\nejections, and that it formed groups of islands in an otherwise\r\nboundless ocean.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the distribution and extent of these\r\npre-Laurentian lands is, and probably ever must be, unknown to us; for\r\nit was only after the Laurentian rocks had been deposited, and after\r\nthe shrinkage of the earth's crust in subsequent times had bent and\r\ncontorted them, that the foundations of the continents were laid. The\r\nrude sketch map of America given in fig. 4 will show this, and will\r\nalso show that the old Laurentian mountains mark out the future form of\r\nthe American continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. _The Laurentian Nucleus of the American\r\nContinent._]\r\n\r\nRocks so highly altered as the Laurentian beds can scarcely be expected\r\nto hold well characterized fossil remains, and those geologists who\r\nentertained any hope that such remains might have been preserved, long\r\nlooked in vain for their actual discovery. Still, as astronomers have\r\nsuspected the existence of unknown planets from observing perturbations\r\nnot accounted for, and as voyagers have suspected the approach to\r\nunknown regions by the appearance of floating wood or stray land birds,\r\nanticipations of such discoveries have been entertained and expressed\r\nfrom time to time. Lyell, Dana, and Sterry Hunt more especially, have\r\ncommitted themselves to such speculations. The reasons assigned may be\r\nstated thus:--\r\n\r\nAssuming the Laurentian rocks to be altered sediments, they must, from\r\ntheir great extent, have been deposited in the ocean; and if there had\r\nbeen no living creatures in the waters, we have no reason to believe\r\nthat they would have consisted of anything more than such sandy and\r\nmuddy debris as may be washed away from wasting rocks originally of\r\nigneous origin. But the Laurentian beds contain other materials than\r\nthese. No formations of any geological age include thicker or more\r\nextensive limestones. One of the beds measured by the officers of the\r\nGeological Survey, is stated to be 1500 feet in thickness, another is\r\n1250 feet thick, and a third 750 feet; making an aggregate of 3500\r\nfeet.[B] These beds may be traced, with more or less interruption,\r\nfor hundreds of miles. Whatever the origin of such limestones, it\r\nis plain that they indicate causes equal in extent, and comparable\r\nin power and duration, with those which have produced the greatest\r\nlimestones of the later geological periods. Now, in later formations,\r\nlimestone is usually an organic rock, accumulated by the slow gathering\r\nfrom the sea-water, or its plants, of calcareous matter, by corals,\r\nforaminifera, or shell-fish, and the deposition of their skeletons,\r\neither entire or in fragments, in the sea-bottom. The most friable\r\nchalk and the most crystalline limestones have alike been formed in\r\nthis way. We know of no reason why it should be different in the\r\nLaurentian period. When, therefore, we find great and conformable\r\nbeds of limestone, such as those described by Sir William Logan in\r\nthe Laurentian of Canada, we naturally imagine a quiet sea-bottom, in\r\nwhich multitudes of animals of humble organization were accumulating\r\nlimestone in their hard parts, and depositing this in gradually\r\nincreasing thickness from age to age. Any attempts to account otherwise\r\nfor these thick and greatly extended beds, regularly interstratified\r\nwith other deposits, have so far been failures, and have arisen either\r\nfrom a want of comprehension of the nature and magnitude of the\r\nappearances to be explained, or from the error of mistaking the true\r\nbedded limestones for veins of calcareous spar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Logan: _Geology of Canada_, p. 45.]\r\n\r\nThe Laurentian rocks contain great quantities of carbon, in the form of\r\ngraphite or plumbago. This does not occur wholly, or even principally,\r\nin veins or fissures, but in the substance of the limestone and gneiss,\r\nand in regular layers. So abundant is it, that I have estimated the\r\namount of carbon in one division of the Lower Laurentian of the Ottawa\r\ndistrict at an aggregate thickness of not less than twenty to thirty\r\nfeet, an amount comparable with that in the true coal formation itself.\r\nNow we know of no agency existing in present or in past geological\r\ntime capable of deoxidizing carbonic acid, and fixing its carbon as\r\nan ingredient in permanent rocks, except vegetable life. Unless,\r\ntherefore, we suppose that there existed in the Laurentian age a vast\r\nabundance of vegetation, either in the sea or on the land, we have no\r\nmeans of explaining the Laurentian graphite.\r\n\r\nThe Laurentian formation contains great beds of oxide of iron,\r\nsometimes seventy feet in thickness. Here again we have an evidence of\r\norganic action; for it is the deoxidizing power of vegetable matter\r\nwhich has in all the later formations been the efficient cause in\r\nproducing bedded deposits of iron. This is the case in modern bog and\r\nlake ores, in the clay iron-stones of the coal measures, and apparently\r\nalso in the great ore beds of the Silurian rocks. May not similar\r\ncauses have been at work in the Laurentian period?\r\n\r\nAny one of these reasons might, in itself, be held insufficient to\r\nprove so great and, at first sight, unlikely a conclusion as that of\r\nthe existence of abundant animal and vegetable life in the Laurentian;\r\nbut the concurrence of the whole in a series of deposits unquestionably\r\nmarine, forms a chain of evidence so powerful that it might command\r\nbelief even if no fragment of any organic and living form or structure\r\nhad ever been recognised in these ancient rocks.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of the matter until the existence of supposed\r\norganic remains was announced by Sir W. Logan, at the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, in Springfield, in 1859;\r\nand we may now proceed to narrate the manner of this discovery, and how\r\nit has been followed up.\r\n\r\nBefore doing so, however, let us visit Eozoon in one of its haunts\r\namong the Laurentian Hills. One of the most noted repositories of its\r\nremains is the great Grenville band of limestone (see section, fig. 3,\r\nand map), the outcrop of which may be seen in our map of the country\r\nnear the Ottawa, twisting itself like a great serpent in the midst of\r\nthe gneissose rocks; and one of the most fruitful localities is at a\r\nplace called Côte St. Pierre on this band. Landing, as I did, with\r\nMr. Weston, of the Geological Survey, last autumn, at Papineauville,\r\nwe find ourselves on the Laurentian rocks, and pass over one of the\r\ngreat bands of gneiss for about twelve miles, to the village of St.\r\nAndré Avelin. On the road we see on either hand abrupt rocky ridges,\r\npartially clad with forest, and sometimes showing on their flanks the\r\nstratification of the gneiss in very distinct parallel bands, often\r\ncontorted, as if the rocks, when soft, had been wrung as a washer-woman\r\nwrings clothes. Between the hills are little irregular valleys, from\r\nwhich the wheat and oats have just been reaped, and the tall Indian\r\ncorn and yellow pumpkins are still standing in the fields. Where not\r\ncultivated, the land is covered with a rich second growth of young\r\nmaples, birches, and oaks, among which still stand the stumps and tall\r\nscathed trunks of enormous pines, which constituted the original\r\nforest. Half way we cross the Nation River, a stream nearly as large as\r\nthe Tweed, flowing placidly between wooded banks, which are mirrored in\r\nits surface; but in the distance we can hear the roar of its rapids,\r\ndreaded by lumberers in their spring drivings of logs, and which we\r\nwere told swallowed up five poor fellows only a few months ago. Arrived\r\nat St. André, we find a wider valley, the indication of the change to\r\nthe limestone band, and along this, with the gneiss hills still in view\r\non either hand, and often encroaching on the road, we drive for five\r\nmiles more to Côte St. Pierre. At this place the lowest depression of\r\nthe valley is occupied by a little pond, and, hard by, the limestone,\r\nprotected by a ridge of gneiss, rises in an abrupt wooded bank by\r\nthe roadside, and a little further forms a bare white promontory,\r\nprojecting into the fields. Here was Mr. Love's original excavation,\r\nwhence some of the greater blocks containing Eozoon were taken, and a\r\nlarger opening made by an enterprising American on a vein of fibrous\r\nserpentine, yielding \"rock cotton,\" for packing steam pistons and\r\nsimilar purposes. (Figs. 5 and 6.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. _Attitude of Limestone at St. Pierre._\r\n\r\n(_a._) Gneiss band in the Limestone. (_b._) Limestone with Eozoon.\r\n(_c._) Diorite and Gneiss.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. _Gneiss and Limestone at St. Pierre._\r\n\r\n(_a._) Limestone. (_b._) Gneiss and Diorite.]\r\n\r\nThe limestone is here highly inclined and much contorted, and in all\r\nthe excavations a thickness of about 100 feet of it may be exposed.\r\nIt is white and crystalline, varying much however in coarseness in\r\ndifferent bands. It is in some layers pure and white, in others it\r\nis traversed by many gray layers of gneissose and other matter, or\r\nby irregular bands and nodules of pyroxene and serpentine, and it\r\ncontains subordinate beds of dolomite. In one layer only, and this\r\nbut a few feet thick, does the Eozoon occur in any abundance in a\r\nperfect state, though fragments and imperfectly preserved specimens\r\nabound in other parts of the bed. It is a great mistake to suppose\r\nthat it constitutes whole beds of rock in an uninterrupted mass.\r\nIts true mode of occurrence is best seen on the weathered surfaces\r\nof the rock, where the serpentinous specimens project in irregular\r\npatches of various sizes, sometimes twisted by the contortion of the\r\nbeds, but often too small to suffer in this way. On such surfaces\r\nthe projecting patches of the fossil exhibit laminæ of serpentine so\r\nprecisely like the _Stromatoporæ_ of the Silurian rocks, that any\r\ncollector would pounce upon them at once as fossils. In some places\r\nthese small weathered specimens can be easily chipped off from the\r\ncrumbling surface of the limestone; and it is perhaps to be regretted\r\nthat they have not been more extensively shown to palæontologists, with\r\nthe cut slices which to many of them are so problematical. One of the\r\noriginal specimens, brought from the Calumet, and now in the Museum\r\nof the Geological Survey of Canada, was of this kind, and much finer\r\nspecimens from Côte St. Pierre are now in that collection and in my\r\nown. A very fine example is represented, on a reduced scale, in Plate\r\nIII., which is taken from an original photograph.[C] In some of the\r\nlayers are found other and more minute fossils than Eozoon, and these,\r\ntogether with its fragmental remains, as ingredients in the limestone,\r\nwill be discussed in the sequel. We may merely notice here that the\r\nmost abundant layer of Eozoon at this place, occurs near the base of\r\nthe great limestone band, and that the upper layers in so far as seen\r\nare less rich in it. Further, there is no necessary connection between\r\nEozoon and the occurrence of serpentine, for there are many layers\r\nfull of bands and lenticular masses of that mineral without any Eozoon\r\nexcept occasional fragments, while the fossil is sometimes partially\r\nmineralized with pyroxene, dolomite, or common limestone. The section\r\nin fig. 5 will serve to show the attitude of the limestone at this\r\nplace, while the more general section, fig. 3, taken from Sir William\r\nLogan, shows its relation to the other Laurentian rocks, and the sketch\r\nin fig. 6 shows its appearance as a feature on the surface of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: By Mr. Weston, of the Geological Survey of Canada.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A.) Sir William E. Logan on the Laurentian System.\r\n\r\n[_Journal of Geological Society of London_, February, 1865.]\r\n\r\n  After stating the division of the Laurentian series into the two\r\n  great groups of the Upper and Lower Laurentian, Sir William goes on\r\n  to say:--\r\n\r\n  \"The united thickness of these two groups in Canada cannot be less\r\n  than 30,000 feet, and probably much exceeds it. The Laurentian of\r\n  the west of Scotland, according to Sir Roderick Murchison, also\r\n  attains a great thickness. In that region the Upper Laurentian or\r\n  Labrador series, has not yet been separately recognised; but from\r\n  Mr. McCulloch's description, as well as from the specimens collected\r\n  by him, and now in the Museum of the Geological Society of London,\r\n  it can scarcely be doubted that the Labrador series occurs in Skye.\r\n  The labradorite and hypersthene rocks from that island are identical\r\n  with those of the Labrador series in Canada and New York, and unlike\r\n  those of any formation at any other known horizon. This resemblance\r\n  did not escape the notice of Emmons, who, in his description of the\r\n  Adirondack Mountains, referred these rocks to the hypersthene rock\r\n  of McCulloch, although these observers, on the opposite sides of\r\n  the Atlantic, looked upon them as unstratified. In the _Canadian\r\n  Naturalist_ for 1862, Mr. Thomas Macfarlane, for some time resident\r\n  in Norway, and now in Canada, drew attention to the striking\r\n  resemblance between the Norwegian primitive gneiss formation, as\r\n  described by Naumann and Keilhau, and observed by himself, and the\r\n  Laurentian, including the Labrador group; and the equally remarkable\r\n  similarity of the lower part of the primitive slate formation\r\n  to the Huronian series, which is a third Canadian group. These\r\n  primitive series attain a great thickness in the north of Europe, and\r\n  constitute the main features of Scandinavian geology.\r\n\r\n  \"In Bavaria and Bohemia there is an ancient gneissic series. After\r\n  the labours in Scotland, by which he was the first to establish a\r\n  Laurentian equivalent in the British Isles, Sir Roderick Murchison,\r\n  turning his attention to this central European mass, placed it on the\r\n  same horizon. These rocks, underlying Barrande's Primordial zone,\r\n  with a great development of intervening clay-slate, extend southward\r\n  in breadth to the banks of the Danube, with a prevailing dip towards\r\n  the Silurian strata. They had previously been studied by Gümbel and\r\n  Crejci, who divided them into an older reddish gneiss and a newer\r\n  grey gneiss. But, on the Danube, the mass which is furthest removed\r\n  from the Silurian rocks being a grey gneiss, Gümbel and Crejci\r\n  account for its presence by an inverted fold in the strata; while\r\n  Sir Roderick places this at the base, and regards the whole as a\r\n  single series, in the normal fundamental position of the Laurentian\r\n  of Scotland and of Canada. Considering the colossal thickness given\r\n  to the series (90,000 feet), it remains to be seen whether it may\r\n  not include both the Lower and Upper Laurentian, and possibly, in\r\n  addition, the Huronian.\r\n\r\n  \"This third Canadian group (the Huronian) has been shown by my\r\n  colleague, Mr. Murray, to be about 18,000 feet thick, and to consist\r\n  chiefly of quartzites, slate-conglomerates, diorites, and limestones.\r\n  The horizontal strata which form the base of the Lower Silurian in\r\n  western Canada, rest upon the upturned edges of the Huronian series;\r\n  which, in its turn, unconformably overlies the Lower Laurentian. The\r\n  Huronian is believed to be more recent than the Upper Laurentian\r\n  series, although the two formations have never yet been seen in\r\n  contact.\r\n\r\n  \"The united thickness of these three great series may possibly\r\n  far surpass that of all the succeeding rocks from the base of the\r\n  Palæozoic series to the present time. We are thus carried back to a\r\n  period so far remote, that the appearance of the so-called Primordial\r\n  fauna may by some be considered a comparatively modern event. We,\r\n  however, find that, even during the Laurentian period, the same\r\n  chemical and mechanical processes which have ever since been at\r\n  work disintegrating and reconstructing the earth's crust were in\r\n  operation as now. In the conglomerates of the Huronian series there\r\n  are enclosed boulders derived from the Laurentian, which seem to show\r\n  that the parent rock was altered to its present crystalline condition\r\n  before the deposit of the newer formation; while interstratified with\r\n  the Laurentian limestones there are beds of conglomerate, the pebbles\r\n  of which are themselves rolled fragments of a still older laminated\r\n  sand-rock, and the formation of these beds leads us still further\r\n  into the past.\r\n\r\n  \"In both the Upper and Lower Laurentian series there are several\r\n  zones of limestone, each of sufficient volume to constitute an\r\n  independent formation. Of these calcareous masses it has been\r\n  ascertained that three, at least, belong to the Lower Laurentian. But\r\n  as we do not as yet know with certainty either the base or the summit\r\n  of this series, these three may be conformably followed by many more.\r\n  Although the Lower and Upper Laurentian rocks spread over more than\r\n  200,000 square miles in Canada, only about 1500 square miles have yet\r\n  been fully and connectedly examined in any one district, and it is\r\n  still impossible to say whether the numerous exposures of Laurentian\r\n  limestone met with in other parts of the province are equivalent to\r\n  any of the three zones, or whether they overlie or underlie them all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(B.) Dr. Sterry Hunt on the Probable Existence of Life in the\r\nLaurentian Period.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Hunt's views on this subject were expressed in the _American\r\n  Journal of Science_, [2], vol. xxxi., p. 395. From this article,\r\n  written in 1861, after the announcement of the existence of laminated\r\n  forms supposed to be organic in the Laurentian, by Sir W. E. Logan,\r\n  but before their structure and affinities had been ascertained, I\r\n  quote the following sentences:--\r\n\r\n  \"We see in the Laurentian series beds and veins of metallic\r\n  sulphurets, precisely as in more recent formations; and the extensive\r\n  beds of iron ore, hundreds of feet thick, which abound in that\r\n  ancient system, correspond not only to great volumes of strata\r\n  deprived of that metal, but, as we may suppose, to organic matters\r\n  which, but for the then great diffusion of iron-oxyd in conditions\r\n  favourable for their oxidation, might have formed deposits of mineral\r\n  carbon far more extensive than those beds of plumbago which we\r\n  actually meet in the Laurentian strata. All these conditions lead us\r\n  then to conclude the existence of an abundant vegetation during the\r\n  Laurentian period.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(C.) The Graphite of the Laurentian.\r\n\r\n  The following is from a paper by the author, in the _Journal of the\r\n  Geological Society_, for February, 1870:--\r\n\r\n  \"The graphite of the Laurentian of Canada occurs both in beds and in\r\n  veins, and in such a manner as to show that its origin and deposition\r\n  are contemporaneous with those of the containing rock. Sir William\r\n  Logan states[D] that 'the deposits of plumbago generally occur in the\r\n  limestones or in their immediate vicinity, and granular varieties\r\n  of the rock often contain large crystalline plates of plumbago. At\r\n  other times this mineral is so finely disseminated as to give a\r\n  bluish-gray colour to the limestone, and the distribution of bands\r\n  thus coloured, seems to mark the stratification of the rock.' He\r\n  further states:--'The plumbago is not confined to the limestones;\r\n  large crystalline scales of it are occasionally disseminated in\r\n  pyroxene rock or pyrallolite, and sometimes in quartzite and in\r\n  feldspathic rocks, or even in magnetic oxide of iron.' In addition\r\n  to these bedded forms, there are also true veins in which graphite\r\n  occurs associated with calcite, quartz, orthoclase, or pyroxene,\r\n  and either in disseminated scales, in detached masses, or in\r\n  bands or layers 'separated from each other and from the wall rock\r\n  by feldspar, pyroxene, and quartz.' Dr. Hunt also mentions the\r\n  occurrence of finely granular varieties, and of that peculiarly\r\n  waved and corrugated variety simulating fossil wood, though really a\r\n  mere form of laminated structure, which also occurs at Warrensburgh,\r\n  New York, and at the Marinski mine in Siberia. Many of the veins\r\n  are not true fissures, but rather constitute a network of shrinkage\r\n  cracks or segregation veins traversing in countless numbers the\r\n  containing rock, and most irregular in their dimensions, so that\r\n  they often resemble strings of nodular masses. It has been supposed\r\n  that the graphite of the veins was originally introduced as a liquid\r\n  hydrocarbon. Dr. Hunt, however, regards it as possible that it\r\n  may have been in a state of aqueous solution;[E] but in whatever\r\n  way introduced, the character of the veins indicates that in the\r\n  case of the greater number of them the carbonaceous material must\r\n  have been derived from the bedded rocks traversed by these veins,\r\n  while there can be no doubt that the graphite found in the beds has\r\n  been deposited along with the calcareous matter or muddy and sandy\r\n  sediment of which these beds were originally composed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: _Geology of Canada_, 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: _Report of the Geological Survey of Canada_, 1866.]\r\n\r\n  \"The quantity of graphite in the Lower Laurentian series is enormous.\r\n  In a recent visit to the township of Buckingham, on the Ottawa\r\n  River, I examined a band of limestone believed to be a continuation\r\n  of that described by Sir W. E. Logan as the Green Lake Limestone.\r\n  It was estimated to amount, with some thin interstratified bands\r\n  of gneiss, to a thickness of 600 feet or more, and was found to\r\n  be filled with disseminated crystals of graphite and veins of the\r\n  mineral to such an extent as to constitute in some places one-fourth\r\n  of the whole; and making every allowance for the poorer portions,\r\n  this band cannot contain in all a less vertical thickness of pure\r\n  graphite than from twenty to thirty feet. In the adjoining township\r\n  of Lochaber Sir W. E. Logan notices a band from twenty-five to thirty\r\n  feet thick, reticulated with graphite veins to such an extent as\r\n  to be mined with profit for the mineral. At another place in the\r\n  same district a bed of graphite from ten to twelve feet thick, and\r\n  yielding twenty per cent. of the pure material, is worked. When it\r\n  is considered that graphite occurs in similar abundance at several\r\n  other horizons, in beds of limestone which have been ascertained by\r\n  Sir W. E. Logan to have an aggregate thickness of 3500 feet, it is\r\n  scarcely an exaggeration to maintain that the quantity of carbon in\r\n  the Laurentian is equal to that in similar areas of the Carboniferous\r\n  system. It is also to be observed that an immense area in Canada\r\n  appears to be occupied by these graphitic and Eozoon limestones, and\r\n  that rich graphitic deposits exist in the continuation of this system\r\n  in the State of New York, while in rocks believed to be of this age\r\n  near St. John, New Brunswick, there is a very thick bed of graphitic\r\n  limestone, and associated with it three regular beds of graphite,\r\n  having an aggregate thickness of about five feet.[F]\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: Matthew, in _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. xxi., p. 423.\r\n_Acadian Geology_, p. 662.]\r\n\r\n  \"It may fairly be assumed that in the present world and in those\r\n  geological periods with whose organic remains we are more familiar\r\n  than with those of the Laurentian, there is no other source of\r\n  unoxidized carbon in rocks than that furnished by organic matter,\r\n  and that this has obtained its carbon in all cases, in the first\r\n  instance, from the deoxidation of carbonic acid by living plants. No\r\n  other source of carbon can, I believe, be imagined in the Laurentian\r\n  period. We may, however, suppose either that the graphitic matter\r\n  of the Laurentian has been accumulated in beds like those of coal,\r\n  or that it has consisted of diffused bituminous matter similar to\r\n  that in more modern bituminous shales and bituminous and oil-bearing\r\n  limestones. The beds of graphite near St. John, some of those in the\r\n  gneiss at Ticonderoga in New York, and at Lochaber and Buckingham\r\n  and elsewhere in Canada, are so pure and regular that one might\r\n  fairly compare them with the graphitic coal of Rhode Island. These\r\n  instances, however, are exceptional, and the greater part of the\r\n  disseminated and vein graphite might rather be compared in its mode\r\n  of occurrence to the bituminous matter in bituminous shales and\r\n  limestones.\r\n\r\n  \"We may compare the disseminated graphite to that which we find in\r\n  those districts of Canada in which Silurian and Devonian bituminous\r\n  shales and limestones have been metamorphosed and converted into\r\n  graphitic rocks not dissimilar to those in the less altered portions\r\n  of the Laurentian.[G] In like manner it seems probable that the\r\n  numerous reticulating veins of graphite may have been formed by\r\n  the segregation of bituminous matter into fissures and planes of\r\n  least resistance, in the manner in which such veins occur in modern\r\n  bituminous limestones and shales. Such bituminous veins occur in\r\n  the Lower Carboniferous limestone and shale of Dorchester and\r\n  Hillsborough, New Brunswick, with an arrangement very similar to that\r\n  of the veins of graphite; and in the Quebec rocks of Point Levi,\r\n  veins attaining to a thickness of more than a foot, are filled with a\r\n  coaly matter having a transverse columnar structure, and regarded by\r\n  Logan and Hunt as an altered bitumen. These palæozoic analogies would\r\n  lead us to infer that the larger part of the Laurentian graphite\r\n  falls under the second class of deposits above mentioned, and that,\r\n  if of vegetable origin, the organic matter must have been thoroughly\r\n  disintegrated and bituminized before it was changed into graphite.\r\n  This would also give a probability that the vegetation implied was\r\n  aquatic, or at least that it was accumulated under water.\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: Granby, Melbourne, Owl's Head, etc., _Geology of Canada_,\r\n1863, p. 599.]\r\n\r\n  \"Dr. Hunt has, however, observed an indication of terrestrial\r\n  vegetation, or at least of subaërial decay, in the great beds of\r\n  Laurentian iron ore. These, if formed in the same manner as more\r\n  modern deposits of this kind, would imply the reducing and solvent\r\n  action of substances produced in the decay of plants. In this case\r\n  such great ore beds as that of Hull, on the Ottawa, seventy feet\r\n  thick, or that near Newborough, 200 feet thick,[H] must represent\r\n  a corresponding quantity of vegetable matter which has totally\r\n  disappeared. It may be added that similar demands on vegetable matter\r\n  as a deoxidizing agent are made by the beds and veins of metallic\r\n  sulphides of the Laurentian, though some of the latter are no doubt\r\n  of later date than the Laurentian rocks themselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: _Geology of Canada_, 1863.]\r\n\r\n  \"It would be very desirable to confirm such conclusions as those\r\n  above deduced by the evidence of actual microscopic structure. It is\r\n  to be observed, however, that when, in more modern sediments, algæ\r\n  have been converted into bituminous matter, we cannot ordinarily\r\n  obtain any structural evidence of the origin of such bitumen, and in\r\n  the graphitic slates and limestones derived from the metamorphosis of\r\n  such rocks no organic structure remains. It is true that, in certain\r\n  bituminous shales and limestones of the Silurian system, shreds of\r\n  organic tissue can sometimes be detected, and in some cases, as in\r\n  the Lower Silurian limestone of the La Cloche mountains in Canada,\r\n  the pores of brachiopodous shells and the cells of corals have been\r\n  penetrated by black bituminous matter, forming what may be regarded\r\n  as natural injections, sometimes of much beauty. In correspondence\r\n  with this, while in some Laurentian graphitic rocks, as, for\r\n  instance, in the compact graphite of Clarendon, the carbon presents\r\n  a curdled appearance due to segregation, and precisely similar to\r\n  that of the bitumen in more modern bituminous rocks, I can detect in\r\n  the graphitic limestones occasional fibrous structures which may be\r\n  remains of plants, and in some specimens vermicular lines, which I\r\n  believe to be tubes of Eozoon penetrated by matter once bituminous,\r\n  but now in the state of graphite.\r\n\r\n  \"When palæozoic land-plants have been converted into graphite,\r\n  they sometimes perfectly retain their structure. Mineral charcoal,\r\n  with structure, exists in the graphitic coal of Rhode Island. The\r\n  fronds of ferns, with their minutest veins perfect, are preserved\r\n  in the Devonian shales of St. John, in the state of graphite; and\r\n  in the same formation there are trunks of Conifers (_Dadoxylon\r\n  ouangondianum_) in which the material of the cell-walls has been\r\n  converted into graphite, while their cavities have been filled with\r\n  calcareous spar and quartz, the finest structures being preserved\r\n  quite as well as in comparatively unaltered specimens from the\r\n  coal-formation.[I] No structures so perfect have as yet been detected\r\n  in the Laurentian, though in the largest of the three graphitic beds\r\n  at St. John there appear to be fibrous structures which I believe may\r\n  indicate the existence of land-plants. This graphite is composed of\r\n  contorted and slickensided laminæ, much like those of some bituminous\r\n  shales and coarse coals; and in these there are occasional small\r\n  pyritous masses which show hollow carbonaceous fibres, in some cases\r\n  presenting obscure indications of lateral pores. I regard these\r\n  indications, however, as uncertain; and it is not as yet fully\r\n  ascertained that these beds at St. John are on the same geological\r\n  horizon with the Lower Laurentian of Canada, though they certainly\r\n  underlie the Primordial series of the Acadian group, and are\r\n  separated from it by beds having the character of the Huronian.\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: _Acadian Geology_, p. 535. In calcified specimens the\r\nstructures remain in the graphite after decalcification by an acid.]\r\n\r\n  \"There is thus no absolute impossibility that distinct organic\r\n  tissues may be found in the Laurentian graphite, if formed from\r\n  land-plants, more especially if any plants existed at that time\r\n  having true woody or vascular tissues; but it cannot with certainty\r\n  be affirmed that such tissues have been found. It is possible,\r\n  however, that in the Laurentian period the vegetation of the land may\r\n  have consisted wholly of cellular plants, as, for example, mosses and\r\n  lichens; and if so, there would be comparatively little hope of the\r\n  distinct preservation of their forms or tissues, or of our being able\r\n  to distinguish the remains of land-plants from those of Algæ.\r\n\r\n  \"We may sum up these facts and considerations in the following\r\n  statements:--First, that somewhat obscure traces of organic structure\r\n  can be detected in the Laurentian graphite; secondly, that the\r\n  general arrangement and microscopic structure of the substance\r\n  corresponds with that of the carbonaceous and bituminous matters\r\n  in marine formations of more modern date; thirdly, that if the\r\n  Laurentian graphite has been derived from vegetable matter, it has\r\n  only undergone a metamorphosis similar in kind to that which organic\r\n  matter in metamorphosed sediment of later age has experienced;\r\n  fourthly, that the association of the graphitic matter with organic\r\n  limestone, beds of iron ore, and metallic sulphides, greatly\r\n  strengthens the probability of its vegetable origin; fifthly, that\r\n  when we consider the immense thickness and extent of the Eozoonal\r\n  and graphitic limestones and iron ore deposits of the Laurentian, if\r\n  we admit the organic origin of the limestone and graphite, we must\r\n  be prepared to believe that the life of that early period, though it\r\n  may have existed under low forms, was most copiously developed, and\r\n  that it equalled, perhaps surpassed, in its results, in the way of\r\n  geological accumulation, that of any subsequent period.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(D.) Western and other Laurentian Rocks, etc.\r\n\r\n  In the map of the Laurentian nucleus of America (fig. 4,) I have\r\n  not inserted the Laurentian rocks believed to exist in the Rocky\r\n  Mountains and other western ranges. Their distribution is at present\r\n  uncertain, as well as the date of their elevation. They may indicate\r\n  an old line of Laurentian fracture or wrinkling, parallel to the west\r\n  coast, and defining its direction. In the map there should be a patch\r\n  of Laurentian in the north of Newfoundland, and it should be wider at\r\n  the west end of lake Superior.\r\n\r\n  Full details as to the Laurentian rocks of Canada and sectional\r\n  lists of their beds will be found in the _Reports of the Geological\r\n  Survey_, and Dr. Hunt has discussed very fully their chemical\r\n  characters and metamorphism in his _Chemical and Geological Essays_.\r\n  The recent reports of Hitchcock on New Hampshire, and Hayden on\r\n  the Western Territories, contain some new facts of interest.\r\n  The former recognises in the White Mountain region a series of\r\n  gneisses and other altered rocks of Lower Laurentian age, and,\r\n  resting unconformably on these, others corresponding to the Upper\r\n  Laurentian; while above the latter are other pre-silurian formations\r\n  corresponding to the Huronian and probably to the Montalban series of\r\n  Hunt. These facts confirm Logan's results in Canada; and Hitchcock\r\n  finds many reasons to believe in the existence of life at the time of\r\n  the deposition of these old rocks. Hayden's report describes granitic\r\n  and gneissose rocks, probably of Laurentian age, as appearing over\r\n  great areas in Colorado, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada--showing the\r\n  existence of this old metamorphic floor over vast regions of Western\r\n  America.\r\n\r\n  The metamorphism of these rocks does not imply any change of\r\n  their constituent elements, or interference with their bedded\r\n  arrangement. It consists in the alteration of the sediments by merely\r\n  molecular changes re-arranging their particles so as to render them\r\n  crystalline, or by chemical reactions producing new combinations of\r\n  their elements. Experiment shows that the action of heat, pressure,\r\n  and waters containing alkaline carbonates and silicates, would\r\n  produce such changes. The amount and character of change would depend\r\n  on the composition of the sediment, the heat applied, the substances\r\n  in solution in the water, and the lapse of time.

In this\r\ncase the stable foundations were laid, years before the discovery\r\nof Eozoon, by the careful surveys made by Sir William Logan and his\r\nassistants, and the chemical examination of the rocks and minerals\r\nby Dr. Sterry Hunt. On the other hand, Dr. Carpenter and others in\r\nEngland were examining the structure of the shells of the humbler\r\ninhabitants of the modern ocean, and the manner in which the pores of\r\ntheir skeletons become infiltrated with mineral matter when deposited\r\nin the sea-bottom. These laborious and apparently dissimilar branches\r\nof scientific inquiry were destined to be united by a series of happy\r\ndiscoveries, made not fortuitously but by painstaking and intelligent\r\nobservers. The discovery of the most ancient fossil was thus not the\r\nchance picking up of a rare and curious specimen. It was not likely\r\nto be found in this way; and if so found, it would have remained\r\nunnoticed and of no scientific value, but for the accumulated stores of\r\nzoological and palæontological knowledge, and the surveys previously\r\nmade, whereby the age and distribution of the Laurentian rocks and\r\nthe chemical conditions of their deposition and metamorphism were\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. _Eozoon mineralized by Loganite and Dolomite._\r\n\r\n(Collected by Dr. Wilson, of Perth.)]\r\n\r\nThe first specimens of Eozoon ever procured, in so far as known, were\r\ncollected at Burgess in Ontario by a veteran Canadian mineralogist,\r\nDr. Wilson of Perth, and were sent to Sir William Logan as mineral\r\nspecimens. Their chief interest at that time lay in the fact that\r\ncertain laminæ of a dark green mineral present in the specimens were\r\nfound, on analysis by Dr. Hunt, to be composed of a new hydrous\r\nsilicate, allied to serpentine, and which he named loganite: one of\r\nthese specimens is represented in fig. 7. The form of this mineral was\r\nnot suspected to be of organic origin. Some years after, in 1858, other\r\nspecimens, differently mineralized with the minerals serpentine and\r\npyroxene, were found by Mr. J. McMullen, an explorer in the service\r\nof the Geological Survey, in the limestone of the Grand Calumet on\r\nthe River Ottawa. These seem to have at once struck Sir W. E. Logan\r\nas resembling the Silurian fossils known as _Stromatopora_, and he\r\nshowed them to Mr. Billings, the palæontologist of the survey, and to\r\nthe writer, with this suggestion, confirming it with the sagacious\r\nconsideration that inasmuch as the Ottawa and Burgess specimens were\r\nmineralized by different substances, yet were alike in form, there was\r\nlittle probability that they were merely mineral or concretionary. Mr.\r\nBillings was naturally unwilling to risk his reputation in affirming\r\nthe organic nature of such specimens; and my own suggestion was that\r\nthey should be sliced, and examined microscopically, and that if\r\nfossils, as they presented merely concentric laminæ and no cells,\r\nthey would probably prove to be protozoa rather than corals. A few\r\nslices were accordingly made, but no definite structure could be\r\ndetected. Nevertheless Sir William Logan took some of the specimens to\r\nthe meeting of the American Association at Springfield, in 1859, and\r\nexhibited them as possibly Laurentian fossils; but the announcement was\r\nevidently received with some incredulity. In 1862 they were exhibited\r\nby Sir William to some geological friends in London, but he remarks\r\nthat \"few seemed disposed to believe in their organic character, with\r\nthe exception of my friend Professor Ramsay.\" In 1863 the General\r\nReport of the Geological Survey, summing up its work to that time,\r\nwas published, under the name of the _Geology of Canada_, and in this,\r\nat page 49, will be found two figures of one of the Calumet specimens,\r\nhere reproduced, and which, though unaccompanied with any specific\r\nname or technical description, were referred to as probably Laurentian\r\nfossils. (Figs. 8 and 9.)\r\n\r\nAbout this time Dr. Hunt happened to mention to me, in connection with\r\na paper on the mineralization of fossils which he was preparing, that\r\nhe proposed to notice the mode of preservation of certain fossil woods\r\nand other things with which I was familiar, and that he would show me\r\nthe paper in proof, in order that he might have any suggestions that\r\noccurred to me. On reading it, I observed, among other things, that\r\nhe alluded to the supposed Laurentian fossils, under the impression\r\nthat the organic part was represented by the serpentine or loganite,\r\nand that the calcareous matter was the filling of the chambers. I took\r\nexception to this, stating that though in the slices before examined\r\nno structure was apparent, still my impression was that the calcareous\r\nmatter was the fossil, and the serpentine or loganite the filling. He\r\nsaid--\"In that case, would it not be well to re-examine the specimens,\r\nand to try to discover which view is correct?\" He mentioned at the same\r\ntime that Sir William had recently shown him some new and beautiful\r\nspecimens collected by Mr. Lowe, one of the explorers on the staff of\r\nthe Survey, from a third locality, at Grenville, on the Ottawa. It was\r\nsupposed that these might throw further light on the subject; and\r\naccordingly Dr. Hunt suggested to Sir William to have additional slices\r\nof these new specimens made by Mr. Weston, of the Survey, whose skill\r\nas a preparer of these and other fossils has often done good service to\r\nscience. A few days thereafter, some slices were sent to me, and were\r\nat once put under the microscope. I was delighted to find in one of the\r\nfirst specimens examined a beautiful group of tubuli penetrating one of\r\nthe calcite layers. Here was evidence, not only that the calcite layers\r\nrepresented the true skeleton of the fossil, but also of its affinities\r\nwith the Foraminifera, whose tubulated supplemental skeleton, as\r\ndescribed and figured by Dr. Carpenter, and represented in specimens\r\nin my collection presented by him, was evidently of the same type with\r\nthat preserved in the canals of these ancient fossils. Fig. 10 is an\r\naccurate representation of the first seen group of canals penetrated by\r\nserpentine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. _Weathered Specimen of Eozoon from the Calumet._\r\n\r\n(Collected by Mr. McMullen.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. _Cross Section of the Specimen represented in\r\nFig. 8._\r\n\r\nThe dark parts are the laminæ of calcareous matter converging to the\r\nouter surface.]\r\n\r\nOn showing the structures discovered to Sir William Logan, he entered\r\ninto the matter with enthusiasm, and had a great number of slices and\r\nafterwards of decalcified specimens prepared, which were placed in my\r\nhands for examination.\r\n\r\nFeeling that the discovery was most important, but that it would be\r\nmet with determined scepticism by a great many geologists, I was\r\nnot content with examining the typical specimens of Eozoon, but had\r\nslices prepared of every variety of Laurentian limestone, of altered\r\nlimestones from the Primordial and Silurian, and of serpentine\r\nmarbles of all the varieties furnished by our collections. These were\r\nexamined with ordinary and polarized light, and with every variety\r\nof illumination. Dr. Hunt, on his part, undertook the chemical\r\ninvestigation of the various associated minerals. An extensive series\r\nof notes and camera tracings were made of all the appearances observed;\r\nand of some of the more important structures beautiful drawings\r\nwere executed by the late Mr. H. S. Smith, the then palæontological\r\ndraughtsman of the Survey. The result of the whole investigation was a\r\nfirm conviction that the structure was organic and foraminiferal, and\r\nthat it could be distinguished from any merely mineral or crystalline\r\nforms occurring in these or other limestones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. _Group of Canals in the Supplemental Skeleton\r\nof Eozoon._\r\n\r\nTaken from the specimen in which they were first recognised.\r\nMagnified.]\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the matter, and after exhibiting to Sir William all\r\nthe characteristic appearances in comparison with such concretionary,\r\ndendritic, and crystalline structures as most resembled them, and also\r\nwith the structure of recent and fossil Foraminifera, I suggested that\r\nthe further prosecution of the matter should be handed over to Mr.\r\nBillings, as palæontologist of the Survey, and as our highest authority\r\non the fossils of the older rocks. I was engaged in other researches,\r\nand knew that no little labour must be devoted to the work and to its\r\npublication, and that some controversy might be expected. Mr. Billings,\r\nhowever, with his characteristic caution and modesty, declined. His\r\nhands, he said, were full of other work, and he had not specially\r\nstudied the microscopic appearances of Foraminifera or of mineral\r\nsubstances. It was finally arranged that I should prepare a description\r\nof the fossil, which Sir William would take to London, along with Dr.\r\nHunt's notes, the more important specimens, and lists of the structures\r\nobserved in each. Sir William was to submit the manuscript and\r\nspecimens to Dr. Carpenter, or failing him to Prof. T. Rupert Jones, in\r\nthe hope that these eminent authorities would confirm our conclusions,\r\nand bring forward new facts which I might have overlooked or been\r\nignorant of. Sir William saw both gentlemen, who gave their testimony\r\nin favour of the organic and foraminiferal character of the specimens;\r\nand Dr. Carpenter in particular gave much attention to the subject, and\r\nworked out the structure of the primary cell-wall, which I had not\r\nobserved previously through a curious accident as to specimens.[J] Mr.\r\nLowe had been sent back to the Ottawa to explore, and just before Sir\r\nWilliam's departure had sent in some specimens from a new locality at\r\nPetite Nation, similar in general appearance to those from Grenville,\r\nwhich Sir William took with him unsliced to England. These showed in\r\na perfect manner the tubuli of the primary cell-wall, which I had in\r\nvain tried to resolve in the Grenville specimens, and which I did\r\nnot see until after it had been detected by Dr. Carpenter in London.\r\nDr. Carpenter thus contributed in a very important manner to the\r\nperfecting of the investigations begun in Canada, and on him has fallen\r\nthe greater part of their illustration and defence,[K] in so far as\r\nGreat Britain is concerned. Fig. 11, taken from one of Dr. Carpenter's\r\npapers, shows the tubulated primitive wall as described by him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: In papers by Dr. Carpenter, subsequently referred to.\r\nProf. Jones published an able exposition of the facts in the _Popular\r\nScience Monthly_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: In _Quarterly Journal of Geological Society_, vol. xxii.;\r\n_Proc. Royal Society_, vol. xv.; _Intellectual Observer_, 1865. _Annals\r\nand Magazine of Natural History_, 1874; and other papers and notices.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. _Portion of Eozoon magnified 100 diameters,\r\nshowing the original Cell-wall with Tubulation, and the Supplemental\r\nSkeleton with Canals._ (_After Carpenter._)\r\n\r\n(_a._) Original tubulated wall or \"Nummuline layer,\" more magnified in\r\nfig. 2. (_b, c._) \"Intermediate skeleton,\" with canals.]\r\n\r\nThe immediate result was a composite paper in the _Proceedings of the\r\nGeological Society_, by Sir W. E. Logan, Dr. Carpenter, Dr. Hunt, and\r\nmyself, in which the geology, palæontology, and mineralogy of _Eozoon\r\nCanadense_ and its containing rocks were first given to the world.[L]\r\nIt cannot be wondered at that when geologists and palæontologists were\r\nthus required to believe in the existence of organic remains in rocks\r\nregarded as altogether Azoic and hopelessly barren of fossils, and\r\nto carry back the dawn of life as far before those Primordial rocks,\r\nwhich were supposed to contain its first traces, as these are before\r\nthe middle period of the earth's life history, some hesitation should\r\nbe felt. Further, the accurate appreciation of the evidence for such a\r\nfossil as Eozoon required an amount of knowledge of minerals, of the\r\nmore humble types of animals, and of the conditions of mineralization\r\nof organic remains, possessed by few even of professional geologists.\r\nThus Eozoon has met with some negative scepticism and a little positive\r\nopposition,--though the latter has been small in amount, when we\r\nconsider the novel and startling character of the facts adduced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: _Journal Geological Society_, February, 1865.]\r\n\r\n\"The united thickness,\" says Sir William Logan, \"of these three great\r\nseries, the Lower and Upper Laurentian and Huronian, may possibly far\r\nsurpass that of all succeeding rocks, from the base of the Palæozoic\r\nto the present time. We are thus carried back to a period so far\r\nremote that the appearance of the so-called Primordial fauna may\r\nbe considered a comparatively modern event.\" So great a revolution\r\nof thought, and this based on one fossil, of a character little\r\nrecognisable by geologists generally, might well tax the faith of a\r\nclass of men usually regarded as somewhat faithless and sceptical. Yet\r\nthis new extension of life has been generally received, and has found\r\nits way into text-books and popular treatises. Its opponents have\r\nbeen under the necessity of inventing the most strange and incredible\r\npseudomorphoses of mineral substances to account for the facts; and\r\nevidently hold out rather in the spirit of adhesion to a lost cause\r\nthan with any hope of ultimate success. As might have been expected,\r\nafter the publication of the original paper, other facts developed\r\nthemselves. Mr. Vennor found other and scarcely altered specimens in\r\nthe Upper Laurentian or Huronian of Tudor. Gümbel recognised the\r\norganism in Laurentian Rocks in Bavaria and elsewhere in Europe, and\r\ndiscovered a new species in the Huronian of Bavaria.[M] Eozoon was\r\nrecognised in Laurentian limestones in Massachusetts[N] and New York,\r\nand there has been a rapid growth of new facts increasing our knowledge\r\nof Foraminifera of similar types in the succeeding Palæozoic rocks.\r\nSpecial interest attaches to the discovery by Mr. Vennor of specimens\r\nof Eozoon contained in a dark micaceous limestone at Tudor, in Ontario,\r\nand really as little metamorphosed as many Silurian fossils. Though in\r\nthis state they show their minute structures less perfectly than in\r\nthe serpentine specimens, the fact is most important with reference\r\nto the vindication of the animal nature of Eozoon. Another fact whose\r\nsignificance is not to be over-estimated, is the recognition both by\r\nDr. Carpenter and myself of specimens in which the canals are occupied\r\nby calcite like that of the organism itself. Quite recently I have, as\r\nmentioned in the last chapter, been enabled to re-examine the locality\r\nat Petite Nation originally discovered by Mr. Lowe, and am prepared to\r\nshow that all the facts with reference to the mode of occurrence of\r\nthe forms in the beds, and their association with layers of fragmental\r\nEozoon, are strictly in accordance with the theory that these old\r\nLaurentian limestones are truly marine deposits, holding the remains of\r\nthe sea animals of their time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: _Ueber das Vorkommen von Eozoon_, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: By Mr. Bicknell at Newbury, and Mr. Burbank at Chelmsford.\r\nThe latter gentleman has since maintained that the limestones at the\r\nlatter place are not true beds; but his own descriptions and figures,\r\nlead to the belief that this is an error of observation on his part.\r\nThe Eozoon in the Chelmsford specimens and in those of Warren, New\r\nYork, is in small and rare fragments in serpentinous limestone.]\r\n\r\nEozoon is not, however, the only witness to the great fact of\r\nLaurentian life, of which it is the most conspicuous exponent. In many\r\nof the Laurentian limestones, mixed with innumerable fragments of\r\nEozoon, there are other fragments with traces of organic structure of\r\na different character. There are also casts in silicious matter which\r\nseem to indicate smaller species of Foraminifera. There are besides to\r\nbe summoned in evidence the enormous accumulations of carbon already\r\nreferred to as existing in the Laurentian rocks, and the worm-burrows,\r\nof which very perfect traces exist in rocks probably of Upper Eozoic\r\nage.\r\n\r\nOther discoveries also are foreshadowed here. The microscope may\r\nyet detect the true nature and affinities of some of the fragments\r\nassociated with Eozoon. Less altered portions of the Laurentian rocks\r\nmay be found, where even the vegetable matter may retain its organic\r\nforms, and where fossils may be recognised by their external outlines\r\nas well as by their internal structure. The Upper Laurentian and the\r\nHuronian have yet to yield up their stores of life. Thus the time may\r\ncome when the rocks now called Primordial shall not be held to be so\r\nin any strict sense, and when swarming dynasties of Protozoa and other\r\nlow forms of life may be known as inhabitants of oceans vastly ancient\r\nas compared with even the old Primordial seas. Who knows whether even\r\nthe land of the Laurentian time may not have been clothed with plants,\r\nperhaps as much more strange and weird than those of the Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous, as those of the latter are when compared with modern\r\nforests?\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A.) Sir William E. Logan on the Discovery and Characters of Eozoon.\r\n\r\n[_Journal of Geological Society_, February, 1865.]\r\n\r\n  \"In the examination of these ancient rocks, the question has often\r\n  naturally occurred to me, whether during these remote periods, life\r\n  had yet appeared on the earth. The apparent absence of fossils from\r\n  the highly crystalline limestones did not seem to offer a proof in\r\n  the negative, any more than their undiscovered presence in newer\r\n  crystalline limestones where we have little doubt they have been\r\n  obliterated by metamorphic action; while the carbon which, in the\r\n  form of graphite, constitutes beds, or is disseminated through the\r\n  calcareous or siliceous strata of the Laurentian series, seems to be\r\n  an evidence of the existence of vegetation, since no one disputes the\r\n  organic character of this mineral in more recent rocks. My colleague,\r\n  Dr. T. Sterry Hunt, has argued for the existence of organic matters\r\n  at the earth's surface during the Laurentian period from the presence\r\n  of great beds of iron ore, and from the occurrence of metallic\r\n  sulphurets;[O] and finally, the evidence was strengthened by the\r\n  discovery of supposed organic forms. These were first brought to me,\r\n  in October, 1858, by Mr. J. McMullen, then attached as an explorer to\r\n  the Geological Survey of the province, from one of the limestones of\r\n  the Laurentian series occurring at the Grand Calumet, on the river\r\n  Ottawa.\r\n\r\n[Footnote O: _Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society_, xv., 493.]\r\n\r\n  \"Any organic remains which may have been entombed in these limestones\r\n  would, if they retained their calcareous character, be almost\r\n  certainly obliterated by crystallization; and it would only be by the\r\n  replacement of the original carbonate of lime by a different mineral\r\n  substance, or by an infiltration of such a substance into all the\r\n  pores and spaces in and about the fossil, that its form would be\r\n  preserved. The specimens from the Grand Calumet present parallel or\r\n  apparently concentric layers resembling those of Stromatopora, except\r\n  that they anastomose at various points. What were first considered\r\n  the layers are composed of crystallized pyroxene, while the then\r\n  supposed interstices consist of carbonate of lime. These specimens,\r\n  one of which is figured in _Geology of Canada_, p. 49, called to\r\n  memory others which had some years previously been obtained from Dr.\r\n  James Wilson, of Perth, and were then regarded merely as minerals.\r\n  They came, I believe, from masses in Burgess, but whether in place\r\n  is not quite certain; and they exhibit similar forms to those of the\r\n  Grand Calumet, composed of layers of a dark green magnesian silicate\r\n  (loganite); while what were taken for the interstices are filled with\r\n  crystalline dolomite. If the specimens from both these places were to\r\n  be regarded as the result of unaided mineral arrangement, it appeared\r\n  to me strange that identical forms should be derived from minerals\r\n  of such different composition. I was therefore disposed to look\r\n  upon them as fossils, and as such they were exhibited by me at the\r\n  meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,\r\n  at Springfield, in August, 1859. See _Canadian Naturalist_, 1859,\r\n  iv., 300. In 1862 they were shown to some of my geological friends\r\n  in Great Britain; but no microscopic structure having been observed\r\n  belonging to them, few seemed disposed to believe in their organic\r\n  character, with the exception of my friend Professor Ramsay.\r\n\r\n  \"One of the specimens had been sliced and submitted to microscopic\r\n  observation, but unfortunately it was one of those composed of\r\n  loganite and dolomite. In these, the minute structure is rarely\r\n  seen. The true character of the specimens thus remained in suspense\r\n  until last winter, when I accidentally observed indications of\r\n  similar forms in blocks of Laurentian limestone which had been\r\n  brought to our museum by Mr. James Lowe, one of our explorers, to\r\n  be sawn up for marble. In this case the forms were composed of\r\n  serpentine and calc-spar; and slices of them having been prepared\r\n  for the microscope, the minute structure was observed in the first\r\n  one submitted to inspection. At the request of Mr. Billings, the\r\n  palæontologist of our Survey, the specimens were confided for\r\n  examination and description to Dr. J. W. Dawson, of Montreal, our\r\n  most practised observer with the microscope; and the conclusions at\r\n  which he has arrived are appended to this communication. He finds\r\n  that the serpentine, which was supposed to replace the organic form,\r\n  really fills the interspaces of the calcareous fossil. This exhibits\r\n  in some parts a well-preserved organic structure, which Dr. Dawson\r\n  describes as that of a Foraminifer, growing in large sessile patches\r\n  after the manner of Polytrema and Carpenteria, but of much larger\r\n  dimensions, and presenting minute points which reveal a structure\r\n  resembling that of other Foraminiferal forms, as, for example\r\n  Calcarina and Nummulina.\r\n\r\n  \"Dr. Dawson's description is accompanied by some remarks by Dr.\r\n  Sterry Hunt on the mineralogical relations of the fossil. He\r\n  observes that while the calcareous septa which form the skeleton of\r\n  the Foraminifer in general remain unchanged, the sarcode has been\r\n  replaced by certain silicates which have not only filled up the\r\n  chambers, cells, and septal orifices, but have been injected into\r\n  the minute tubuli, which are thus perfectly preserved, as may be\r\n  seen by removing the calcareous matter by an acid. The replacing\r\n  silicates are white pyroxene, serpentine, loganite, and pyrallolite\r\n  or rensselaerite. The pyroxene and serpentine are often found\r\n  in contact, filling contiguous chambers in the fossil, and were\r\n  evidently formed in consecutive stages of a continuous process. In\r\n  the Burgess specimens, while the sarcode is replaced by loganite, the\r\n  calcareous skeleton, as has already been stated, has been replaced\r\n  by dolomite, and the finer parts of the structure have been almost\r\n  wholly obliterated. But in the other specimens, where the skeleton\r\n  still preserves its calcareous character, the resemblance between\r\n  the mode of preservation of the ancient Laurentian Foraminifera, and\r\n  that of the allied forms in Tertiary and recent deposits (which,\r\n  as Ehrenberg, Bailey, and Pourtales have shown, are injected with\r\n  glauconite), is obvious.\r\n\r\n  \"The Grenville specimens belong to the highest of the three already\r\n  mentioned zones of Laurentian limestone, and it has not yet been\r\n  ascertained whether the fossil extends to the two conformable lower\r\n  ones, or to the calcareous zones of the overlying unconformable\r\n  Upper Laurentian series. It has not yet either been determined\r\n  what relation the strata from which the Burgess and Grand Calumet\r\n  specimens have been obtained bear to the Grenville limestone or\r\n  to one another. The zone of Grenville limestone is in some places\r\n  about 1500 feet thick, and it appears to be divided for considerable\r\n  distances into two or three parts by very thick bands of gneiss.\r\n  One of these occupies a position towards the lower part of the\r\n  limestone, and may have a volume of between 100 and 200 feet. It is\r\n  at the base of the limestone that the fossil occurs. This part of\r\n  the zone is largely composed of great and small irregular masses of\r\n  white crystalline pyroxene, some of them twenty yards in length by\r\n  four or five wide. They appear to be confusedly placed one above\r\n  another, with many ragged interstices, and smoothly-worn, rounded,\r\n  large and small pits and sub-cylindrical cavities, some of them\r\n  pretty deep. The pyroxene, though it appears compact, presents a\r\n  multitude of small spaces consisting of carbonate of lime, and many\r\n  of these show minute structures similar to that of the fossil.\r\n  These masses of pyroxene may characterize a thickness of about 200\r\n  feet, and the interspaces among them are filled with a mixture of\r\n  serpentine and carbonate of lime. In general a sheet of pure dark\r\n  green serpentine invests each mass of pyroxene; the thickness of the\r\n  serpentine, varying from the sixteenth of an inch to several inches,\r\n  rarely exceeding half a foot. This is followed in different spots\r\n  by parallel, waving, irregularly alternating plates of carbonate of\r\n  lime and serpentine, which become gradually finer as they recede\r\n  from the pyroxene, and occasionally occupy a total thickness of\r\n  five or six inches. These portions constitute the unbroken fossil,\r\n  which may sometimes spread over an area of about a square foot, or\r\n  perhaps more. Other parts, immediately on the outside of the sheet of\r\n  serpentine, are occupied with about the same thickness of what appear\r\n  to be the ruins of the fossil, broken up into a more or less granular\r\n  mixture of calc-spar and serpentine, the former still showing minute\r\n  structure; and on the outside of the whole a similar mixture appears\r\n  to have been swept by currents and eddies into rudely parallel and\r\n  curving layers; the mixture becoming gradually more calcareous as it\r\n  recedes from the pyroxene. Sometimes beds of limestone of several\r\n  feet in thickness, with the green serpentine more or less aggregated\r\n  into layers, and studded with isolated lumps of pyroxene, are\r\n  irregularly interstratified in the mass of rock; and less frequently\r\n  there are met with lenticular patches of sandstone or granular\r\n  quartzite, of a foot in thickness and several yards in diameter,\r\n  holding in abundance small disseminated leaves of graphite.\r\n\r\n  \"The general character of the rock connected with the fossil produces\r\n  the impression that it is a great Foraminiferal reef, in which the\r\n  pyroxenic masses represent a more ancient portion, which having\r\n  died, and having become much broken up and worn into cavities and\r\n  deep recesses, afforded a seat for a new growth of Foraminifera,\r\n  represented by the calcareo-serpentinous part. This in its turn\r\n  became broken up, leaving in some places uninjured portions of the\r\n  general form. The main difference between this Foraminiferal reef and\r\n  more recent coral-reefs seems to be that, while in the latter are\r\n  usually associated many shells and other organic remains, in the more\r\n  ancient one the only remains yet found are those of the animal which\r\n  built the reef.\"\r\n\r\n(B.) NOTE BY SIR WILLIAM E. LOGAN, ON ADDITIONAL SPECIMENS OF EOZOON.\r\n\r\n[_Journal of Geological Society_, August, 1867.]\r\n\r\n  \"Since the subject of Laurentian fossils was placed before this\r\n  Society in the papers of Dr. Dawson, Dr. Carpenter, Dr. T. Sterry\r\n  Hunt, and myself, in 1865, additional specimens of Eozoon have been\r\n  obtained during the explorations of the Geological Survey of Canada.\r\n  These, as in the case of the specimens first discovered, have been\r\n  submitted to the examination of Dr. Dawson; and it will be observed,\r\n  from his remarks contained in the paper which is to follow, that one\r\n  of them has afforded further, and what appears to him conclusive,\r\n  evidence of their organic character. The specimens and remarks have\r\n  been submitted to Dr. Carpenter, who coincides with Dr. Dawson;\r\n  and the object of what I have to say in connection with these new\r\n  specimens is merely to point out the localities in which they have\r\n  been procured.\r\n\r\n  \"The most important of these specimens was met with last summer by\r\n  Mr. G. H. Vennor, one of the assistants on the Canadian Geological\r\n  Survey, in the township of Tudor and county of Hastings, Ontario,\r\n  about forty-five miles inland from the north shore of Lake Ontario,\r\n  west of Kingston. It occurred on the surface of a layer, three inches\r\n  thick, of dark grey micaceous limestone or calc-schist, near the\r\n  middle of a great zone of similar rock, which is interstratified\r\n  with beds of yellowish-brown sandstone, gray close grained silicious\r\n  limestone, white coarsely granular limestone, and bands of dark\r\n  bluish compact limestone and black pyritiferous slates, to the whole\r\n  of which Mr. Vennor gives a thickness of 1000 feet. Beneath this zone\r\n  are gray and pink dolomites, bluish and grayish mica slates, with\r\n  conglomerates, diorites, and beds of magnetite, a red orthoclase\r\n  gneiss lying at the base. The whole series, according to Mr. Vennor's\r\n  section, which is appended, has a thickness of more than 12,000\r\n  feet; but the possible occurrence of more numerous folds than have\r\n  hitherto been detected, may hereafter render necessary a considerable\r\n  reduction.\r\n\r\n  \"These measures appear to be arranged in the form of a trough,\r\n  to the eastward of which, and probably beneath them, there are\r\n  rocks resembling those of Grenville, from which the former differ\r\n  considerably in lithological character; it is therefore supposed\r\n  that the Hastings series may be somewhat higher in horizon than\r\n  that of Grenville. From the village of Madoc, the zone of gray\r\n  micaceous limestone, which has been particularly alluded to, runs\r\n  to the eastward on one side of the trough, in a nearly vertical\r\n  position into Elzivir, and on the other side to the northward,\r\n  through the township of Madoc into that of Tudor, partially and\r\n  unconformably overlaid in several places by horizontal beds of Lower\r\n  Silurian limestone, but gradually spreading, from a diminution of\r\n  the dip, from a breadth of half a mile to one of four miles. Where\r\n  it thus spreads out in Tudor it becomes suddenly interrupted for a\r\n  considerable part of its breadth by an isolated mass of anorthosite\r\n  rock, rising about 150 feet above the general plain, and supposed to\r\n  belong to the unconformable Upper Laurentian.\"\r\n\r\n  [Subsequent observations, however, render it probable that some of\r\n  the above beds may be Huronian.]\r\n\r\n  \"The Tudor limestone is comparatively unaltered: and, in the specimen\r\n  obtained from it, the general form or skeleton of the fossil\r\n  (consisting of white carbonate of lime) is imbedded in the limestone,\r\n  without the presence of serpentine or other silicate, the colour of\r\n  the skeleton contrasting strongly with that of the rock. It does not\r\n  sink deep into the rock, the form having probably been loose and much\r\n  abraded on what is now the under part, before being entombed. On what\r\n  was the surface of the bed, the form presents a well-defined outline\r\n  on one side; in this and in the arrangement of the septal layers\r\n  it has a marked resemblance to the specimen first brought from the\r\n  Calumet, eighty miles to the north-east, and figured in the _Geology\r\n  of Canada_, p. 49; while all the forms from the Calumet, like that\r\n  from Tudor, are isolated, imbedded specimens, unconnected apparently\r\n  with any continuous reef, such as exists at Grenville and the Petite\r\n  Nation. It will be seen, from Dr. Dawson's paper, that the minute\r\n  structure is present in the Tudor specimen, though somewhat obscure;\r\n  but in respect to this, strong subsidiary evidence is derived from\r\n  fragments of Eozoon detected by Dr. Dawson in a specimen collected\r\n  by myself from the same zone of limestone near the village of Madoc,\r\n  in which the canal-system, much more distinctly displayed, is filled\r\n  with carbonate of lime, as quoted from Dr. Dawson by Dr. Carpenter\r\n  in the Journal of this Society for August, 1866.\r\n\r\n  \"In Dr. Dawson's paper mention is made of specimens from Wentworth,\r\n  and others from Long Lake. In both of these localities the rock\r\n  yielding them belongs to the Grenville band, which is the uppermost\r\n  of the three great bands of limestone hitherto described as\r\n  interstratified in the Lower Laurentian series. That at Long Lake,\r\n  situated about twenty-five miles north of Côte St. Pierre in the\r\n  Petite Nation seigniory, where the best of the previous specimens\r\n  were obtained, is in the direct run of the limestone there: and like\r\n  it the Long Lake rock is of a serpentinous character. The locality\r\n  in Wentworth occurs on Lake Louisa, about sixteen miles north of\r\n  east from that of the first Grenville specimens, from which Côte St.\r\n  Pierre is about the same distance north of west, the lines measuring\r\n  these distances running across several important undulations in\r\n  the Grenville band in both directions. The Wentworth specimens are\r\n  imbedded in a portion of the Grenville band, which appears to have\r\n  escaped any great alteration, and is free from serpentine, though a\r\n  mixture of serpentine with white crystalline limestone occurs in the\r\n  band within a mile of the spot. From this grey limestone, which has\r\n  somewhat the aspect of a conglomerate, specimens have been obtained\r\n  resembling some of the figures given by Gümbel in his _Illustrations_\r\n  of the forms met with by him in the Laurentian rocks of Bavaria.\r\n\r\n  \"In decalcifying by means of a dilute acid some of the specimens\r\n  from Côte St. Pierre, placed in his hands in 1864-65, Dr. Carpenter\r\n  found that the action of the acid was arrested at certain portions\r\n  of the skeleton, presenting a yellowish-brown surface; and he showed\r\n  me, two or three weeks ago, that in a specimen recently given him,\r\n  from the same locality, considerable portions of the general form\r\n  remained undissolved by such an acid. On partially reducing some\r\n  of these portions to a powder; however, we immediately observed\r\n  effervescence by the dilute acid; and strong acid produced it without\r\n  bruising. There is little doubt that these portions of the skeleton\r\n  are partially replaced by dolomite, as more recent fossils are\r\n  often known to be, of which there is a noted instance in the Trenton\r\n  limestone of Ottawa. But the circumstance is alluded to for the\r\n  purpose of comparing these dolomitized portions of the skeleton with\r\n  the specimens from Burgess, in which the replacement of the septal\r\n  layers by dolomite appears to be the general condition. In such of\r\n  these specimens as have been examined the minute structure seems to\r\n  be wholly, or almost wholly, destroyed; but it is probable that upon\r\n  a further investigation of the locality some spots will be found\r\n  to yield specimens in which the calcareous skeleton still exists\r\n  unreplaced by dolomite; and I may safely venture to predict that in\r\n  such specimens the minute structure, in respect both to canals and\r\n  tubuli, will be found as well preserved as in any of the specimens\r\n  from Côte St. Pierre.\r\n\r\n  \"It was the general form on weathered surfaces, and its strong\r\n  resemblance to Stromatopora, which first attracted my attention to\r\n  Eozoon; and the persistence of it in two distinct minerals, pyroxene\r\n  and loganite, emboldened me, in 1857, to place before the Meeting of\r\n  the American Association for the Advancement of Science specimens of\r\n  it as probably a Laurentian fossil. After that, the form was found\r\n  preserved in a third mineral, serpentine; and in one of the previous\r\n  specimens it was then observed to pass continuously through two\r\n  of the minerals, pyroxene and serpentine. Now we have it imbedded\r\n  in limestone, just as most fossils are. In every case, with the\r\n  exception of the Burgess specimens, the general form is composed of\r\n  carbonate of lime; and we have good grounds for supposing it was\r\n  originally so in the Burgess specimens also. If, therefore, with such\r\n  evidence, and without the minute structure, I was, upon a calculation\r\n  of chances, disposed, in 1857, to look upon the form as organic, much\r\n  more must I so regard it when the chances have been so much augmented\r\n  by the subsequent accumulation of evidence of the same kind, and\r\n  the addition of the minute structure, as described by Dr. Dawson,\r\n  whose observations have been confirmed and added to by the highest\r\n  British authority upon the class of animals to which the form has\r\n  been referred, leaving in my mind no room whatever for doubt of its\r\n  organic character. Objections to it as an organism have been made by\r\n  Professors King and Rowney: but these appear to me to be based upon\r\n  the supposition that because some parts simulating organic structure\r\n  are undoubtedly mere mineral arrangement, therefore all parts are\r\n  mineral. Dr. Dawson has not proceeded upon the opposite supposition,\r\n  that because some parts are, in his opinion, undoubtedly organic,\r\n  therefore all parts simulating organic structure are organic; but\r\n  he has carefully distinguished between the mineral and organic\r\n  arrangements. I am aware, from having supplied him with a vast number\r\n  of specimens prepared for the microscope by the lapidary of the\r\n  Canadian Survey, from a series of rocks of Silurian and Huronian,\r\n  as well as Laurentian age, and from having followed the course of\r\n  his investigation as it proceeded, that nearly all the points of\r\n  objection of Messrs. King and Rowney passed in review before him\r\n  prior to his coming to the conclusions which he has published.\"\r\n\r\n_Ascending Section of the Eozoic Rocks in the County of Hastings,\r\nOntario._ By Mr. H.

If\r\nwe take as a familiar example of these the gelatinous and microscopic\r\ncreature found in stagnant ponds, and known as the _Amœba_[P] (fig.\r\n12), it will form a convenient starting point. Viewed under a low\r\npower, it appears as a little patch of jelly, irregular in form, and\r\nconstantly changing its aspect as it moves, by the extension of parts\r\nof its body into finger-like processes or pseudopods which serve as\r\nextempore limbs. When moving on the surface of a slip of glass under\r\nthe microscope, it seems, as it were, to flow along rather than creep,\r\nand its body appears to be of a semi-fluid consistency. It may be taken\r\nas an example of the least complex forms of animal life known to us,\r\nand is often spoken of by naturalists as if it were merely a little\r\nparticle of living and scarcely organized jelly or protoplasm. When\r\nminutely examined, however, it will not be found so simple as it at\r\nfirst sight appears. Its outer layer is clear or transparent, and more\r\ndense than the inner mass, which seems granular. It has at one end a\r\ncurious vesicle which can be seen gradually to expand and become filled\r\nwith a clear drop of liquid, and then suddenly to contract and expel\r\nthe contained fluid through a series of pores in the adjacent part of\r\nthe outer wall. This is the so-called pulsating vesicle, and is an\r\norgan both of circulation and excretion. In another part of the body\r\nmay be seen the nucleus, which is a little cell capable, at certain\r\ntimes, of producing by its division new individuals. Food when taken\r\nin through the wall of the body forms little pellets, which become\r\nsurrounded by a digestive liquid exuded from the enclosing mass into\r\nrounded cavities or extemporised stomachs. Minute granules are seen\r\nto circulate in the gelatinous interior, and may be substitutes for\r\nblood-cells, and the outer layer of the body is capable of protrusion\r\nin any direction into long processes, which are very mobile, and used\r\nfor locomotion and prehension. Further, this creature, though destitute\r\nof most of the parts which we are accustomed to regard as proper to\r\nanimals, seems to exercise volition, and to show the same appetites\r\nand passions with animals of higher type. I have watched one of these\r\nanimalcules endeavouring to swallow a one-celled plant as long as its\r\nown body; evidently hungry and eager to devour the tempting morsel, it\r\nstretched itself to its full extent, trying to envelope the object of\r\nits desire. It failed again and again; but renewed the attempt, until\r\nat length, convinced of its hopelessness, it flung itself away as if in\r\ndisappointment, and made off in search of something more manageable.\r\nWith the Amœba are found other types of equally simple Protozoa, but\r\nsomewhat differently organized. One of these, _Actinophrys_ (fig. 13),\r\nhas the body globular and unchanging in form, the outer wall of greater\r\nthickness; the pulsating vesicle like a blister on the surface, and the\r\npseudopods long and thread-like. Its habits are similar to those of the\r\nAmœba, and I introduce it to show the variations of form and structure\r\npossible even among these simple creatures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote P: The alternating animal, alluding to its change of form.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. _Entosolenia._\r\n\r\nA one-celled Foraminifer. Magnified as a transparent object.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. _Biloculina._\r\n\r\nA many-chambered Foraminifer. Magnified as a transparent object.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. _Polystomella._\r\n\r\nA spiral Foraminifer. Magnified as an opaque object.]\r\n\r\nThe Amœba and Actinophrys are fresh water animals, and are destitute\r\nof any shell or covering. But in the sea there exist swarms of similar\r\ncreatures, equally simple in organization, but gifted with the power of\r\nsecreting around their soft bodies beautiful little shells or crusts of\r\ncarbonate of lime, having one orifice, and often in addition multitudes\r\nof microscopic pores through which the soft gelatinous matter can ooze,\r\nand form outside finger-like or thread-like extensions for collecting\r\nfood. In some cases the shell consists of a single cavity only, but in\r\nmost, after one cell is completed, others are added, forming a series\r\nof cells or chambers communicating with each other, and often arranged\r\nspirally or otherwise in most beautiful and symmetrical forms. Some of\r\nthese creatures, usually named Foraminifera, are locomotive, others\r\nsessile and attached. Most of them are microscopic, but some grow by\r\nmultiplication of chambers till they are a quarter of an inch or more\r\nin breadth. (Figs. 14 to 17.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. _Polymorphina._\r\n\r\nA many-chambered Foraminifer. Magnified as an opaque object. Figs. 14\r\nto 17 are from original sketches of Post-pliocene specimens.]\r\n\r\nThe original skeleton or primary cell-wall of most of these creatures\r\nis seen under the microscope to be perforated with innumerable pores,\r\nand is extremely thin. When, however, owing to the increased size of\r\nthe shell, or other wants of the creature, it is necessary to give\r\nstrength, this is done by adding new portions of carbonate of lime to\r\nthe outside, and to these Dr. Carpenter has given the appropriate name\r\nof \"supplemental skeleton;\" and this, when covered by new growths,\r\nbecomes what he has termed an \"intermediate skeleton.\" The supplemental\r\nskeleton is also traversed by tubes, but these are often of larger size\r\nthan the pores of the cell-wall, and of greater length, and branched in\r\na complicated manner. (Fig. 20.) Thus there are microscopic characters\r\nby which these curious shells can be distinguished from those of\r\nother marine animals; and by applying these characters we learn that\r\nmultitudes of creatures of this type have existed in former periods of\r\nthe world's history, and that their shells, accumulated in the bottom\r\nof the sea, constitute large portions of many limestones. The manner in\r\nwhich such accumulation takes place we learn from what is now going on\r\nin the ocean, more especially from the result of the recent deep-sea\r\ndredging expeditions. The Foraminifera are vastly numerous, both near\r\nthe surface and at the bottom of the sea, and multiply rapidly; and\r\nas successive generations die, their shells accumulate on the ocean\r\nbed, or are swept by currents into banks, and thus in process of time\r\nconstitute thick beds of white chalky material, which may eventually\r\nbe hardened into limestone. This process is now depositing a great\r\nthickness of white ooze in the bottom of the ocean; and in times past\r\nit has produced such vast thicknesses of calcareous matter as the chalk\r\nand the nummulitic limestone of Europe and the orbitoidal limestone\r\nof America. The chalk, which alone attains a maximum thickness of 1000\r\nfeet, and, according to Lyell, can be traced across Europe for 1100\r\ngeographical miles, may be said to be entirely composed of shells\r\nof Foraminifera imbedded in a paste of still more minute calcareous\r\nbodies, the Coccoliths, which are probably products of marine\r\nvegetable life, if not of some animal organism still simpler than the\r\nForaminifera.\r\n\r\nLastly, we find that in the earlier geological ages there existed\r\nmuch larger Foraminifera than any found in our present seas; and that\r\nthese, always sessile on the bottom, grew by the addition of successive\r\nchambers, in the same manner with the smaller species. To some of these\r\nwe shall return in the sequel. In the meantime we shall see what claims\r\nEozoon has to be included among them.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, examine the structure of Eozoon, taking a typical\r\nspecimen, as we find it in the limestone of Grenville or Petite Nation.\r\nIn such specimens the skeleton of the animal is represented by a white\r\ncrystalline marble, the cavities of the cells by green serpentine, the\r\nmode of whose introduction we shall have to consider in the sequel.\r\nThe lowest layer of serpentine represents the first gelatinous coat\r\nof animal matter which grew upon the bottom, and which, if we could\r\nhave seen it before any shell was formed upon its surface, must have\r\nresembled, in appearance at least, the shapeless coat of living slime\r\nfound in some portions of the bed of the deep sea, which has received\r\nfrom Huxley the name _Bathybius_, and which is believed to be a\r\nprotozoon of indefinite extension, though it may possibly be merely the\r\npulpy sarcode of sponges and similar things penetrating the ooze at\r\ntheir bases. On this primary layer grew a delicate calcareous shell,\r\nperforated by innumerable minute tubuli, and by some larger pores or\r\nseptal orifices, while supported at intervals by perpendicular plates\r\nor pillars. Upon this again was built up, in order to strengthen it,\r\na thickening or supplemental skeleton, more dense, and destitute of\r\nfine tubuli, but traversed by branching canals, through which the\r\nsoft gelatinous matter could pass for the nourishment of the skeleton\r\nitself, and the extension of pseudopods beyond it. (Fig. 10.) So was\r\nformed the first layer of Eozoon, which seems in some cases to have\r\nspread by lateral extension over several inches of sea bottom. On this\r\nthe process of growth of successive layers of animal sarcode and of\r\ncalcareous skeleton was repeated again and again, till in some cases\r\neven a hundred or more layers were formed. (Photograph, Plate III.,\r\nand nature print, Plate V.) As the process went on, however, the\r\nvitality of the organism became exhausted, probably by the deficient\r\nnourishment of the central and lower layers making greater and greater\r\ndemands on those above, and so the succeeding layers became thinner,\r\nand less supplemental skeleton was developed. Finally, toward the\r\ntop, the regular arrangement in layers was abandoned, and the cells\r\nbecame a mass of rounded chambers, irregularly piled up in what Dr.\r\nCarpenter has termed an \"acervuline\" manner, and with very thin walls\r\nunprotected by supplemental skeleton. Then the growth was arrested,\r\nand possibly these upper layers gave off reproductive germs, fitted\r\nto float or swim away and to establish new colonies. We may have\r\nsuch reproductive germs in certain curious globular bodies, like\r\nloose cells, found in connection with irregular Eozoon in one of\r\nthe Laurentian limestones at Long Lake and elsewhere. These curious\r\norganisms I observed some years ago, but no description of them was\r\npublished at the time, as I hoped to obtain better examples. I now\r\nfigure some of them, and give their description in a note. (Fig. 18).\r\nI have recently obtained numerous additional examples from the beds\r\nholding Eozoon at St. Pierre, on the Ottawa. They occur at this place\r\non the surface of layers of the limestone in vast numbers, as if they\r\nhad been growing separately on the bottom, or had been drifted over\r\nit by currents. These we shall further discuss hereafter. Such was\r\nthe general mode of growth of Eozoon, and we may now consider more in\r\ndetail some questions as to its gigantic size, its precise mode of\r\nnutrition, the arrangement of its parts, its relations to more modern\r\nforms, and the effects of its growth in the Laurentian seas. In the\r\nmeantime a study of our illustration, Plate IV., which is intended as a\r\nmagnified restoration of the animal, will enable the reader distinctly\r\nto understand its structure and probable mode of growth, and to avail\r\nhimself intelligently of the partial representations of its fossilized\r\nremains in the other plates and woodcuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. _Minute Foraminiferal forms from the Laurentian\r\nof Long Lake._\r\n\r\nHighly magnified. (_a._) Single cell, showing tubulated wall. (_b, c._)\r\nPortions of same more highly magnified. (_d._) Serpentine cast of a\r\nsimilar chamber, decalcified, and showing casts of tubuli.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to its size, we shall find in a subsequent chapter that\r\nthis was rivalled by some succeeding animals of the same humble type\r\nin the Silurian age; and that, as a whole, foraminiferal animals have\r\nbeen diminishing in size in the lapse of geological time. It is indeed\r\na fact of so frequent occurrence that it may almost be regarded as\r\na law of the introduction of new forms of life, that they assume in\r\ntheir early history gigantic dimensions, and are afterwards continued\r\nby less magnificent species. The relations of this to external\r\nconditions, in the case of higher animals, are often complex and\r\ndifficult to understand; but in organisms so low as Eozoon and its\r\nallies, they lie more on the surface. Such creatures may be regarded\r\nas the simplest and most ready media for the conversion of vegetable\r\nmatter into animal tissues, and their functions are almost entirely\r\nlimited to those of nutrition. Hence it is likely that they will be\r\nable to appear in the most gigantic forms under such conditions as\r\nafford them the greatest amount of pabulum for the nourishment of\r\ntheir soft parts and for their skeletons. There is reason to believe,\r\nfor example, that the occurrence, both in the chalk and the deep-sea\r\nmud, of immense quantities of the minute bodies known as Coccoliths\r\nalong with Foraminifera, is not accidental. The Coccoliths appear to\r\nbe grains of calcareous matter formed in minute plants adapted to a\r\ndeep-sea habitat; and these, along with the vegetable and animal debris\r\nconstantly being derived from the death of the living things at the\r\nsurface, afford the material both of sarcode and shell. Now if the\r\nLaurentian graphite represents an exuberance of vegetable growth in\r\nthose old seas proportionate to the great supplies of carbonic acid\r\nin the atmosphere and in the waters, and if the Eozoic ocean was even\r\nbetter supplied with carbonate of lime than those Silurian seas whose\r\nvast limestones bear testimony to their richness in such material, we\r\ncan easily imagine that the conditions may have been more favourable\r\nto a creature like Eozoon than those of any other period of geological\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nGrowing, as Eozoon did, on the floor of the ocean, and covering wide\r\npatches with more or less irregular masses, it must have thrown up from\r\nits whole surface its pseudopods to seize whatever floating particles\r\nof food the waters carried over it. There is also reason to believe,\r\nfrom the outline of certain specimens, that it often grew upward in\r\ncylindrical or club-shaped forms, and that the broader patches were\r\npenetrated by large pits or oscula, admitting the sea-water deeply into\r\nthe substance of the masses. In this way its growth might be rapid and\r\ncontinuous; but it does not seem to have possessed the power of growing\r\nindefinitely by new and living layers covering those that had died,\r\nin the manner of some corals. Its life seems to have had a definite\r\ntermination, and when that was reached an entirely new colony had to\r\nbe commenced. In this it had more affinity with the Foraminifera, as\r\nwe now know them, than with the corals, though practically it had the\r\nsame power with the coral polyps of accumulating limestone in the sea\r\nbottom, a power indeed still possessed by its foraminiferal successors.\r\nIn the case of coral limestones, we know that a large proportion of\r\nthese consist not of continuous reefs but of fragments of coral mixed\r\nwith other calcareous organisms, spread usually by waves and currents\r\nin continuous beds over the sea bottom. In like manner we find in\r\nthe limestones containing Eozoon, layers of fragmental matter which\r\nshows in places the characteristic structures, and which evidently\r\nrepresents the debris swept from the Eozoic masses and reefs by the\r\naction of the waves. It is with this fragmental matter that the small\r\nrounded organisms already referred to most frequently occur; and while\r\nthey may be distinct animals, they may also be the fry of Eozoon, or\r\nsmall portions of its acervuline upper surface floated off in a living\r\nstate, and possibly capable of living independently and of founding new\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nIt is only by a somewhat wild poetical licence that Eozoon has been\r\nrepresented as a \"kind of enormous composite animal stretching from the\r\nshores of Labrador to Lake Superior, and thence northward and southward\r\nto an unknown distance, and forming masses 1500 feet in depth.\" We may\r\ndiscuss by-and-by the question of the composite nature of masses of\r\nEozoon, and we see in the corals evidence of the great size to which\r\ncomposite animals of a higher grade can attain. In the case of Eozoon\r\nwe must imagine an ocean floor more uniform and level than that now\r\nexisting. On this the organism would establish itself in spots and\r\npatches. These might finally become confluent over large areas, just\r\nas massive corals do. As individual masses attained maturity and died,\r\ntheir pores would be filled up with limestone or silicious deposits,\r\nand thus could form a solid basis for new generations, and in this way\r\nlimestone to an indefinite extent might be produced. Further, wherever\r\nsuch masses were high enough to be attacked by the breakers, or where\r\nportions of the sea bottom were elevated, the more fragile parts of the\r\nsurface would be broken up and scattered widely in beds of fragments\r\nover the bottom of the sea, while here and there beds of mud or sand\r\nor of volcanic debris would be deposited over the living or dead\r\norganic mass, and would form the layers of gneiss and other schistose\r\nrocks interstratified with the Laurentian limestone. In this way, in\r\nshort, Eozoon would perform a function combining that which corals and\r\nForaminifera perform in the modern seas; forming both reef limestones\r\nand extensive chalky beds, and probably living both in the shallow and\r\nthe deeper parts of the ocean. If in connection with this we consider\r\nthe rapidity with which the soft, simple, and almost structureless\r\nsarcode of these Protozoa can be built up, and the probability that\r\nthey were more abundantly supplied with food, both for nourishing their\r\nsoft parts and skeletons, than any similar creatures in later times, we\r\ncan readily understand the great volume and extent of the Laurentian\r\nlimestones which they aided in producing. I say aided in producing,\r\nbecause I would not desire to commit myself to the doctrine that the\r\nLaurentian limestones are wholly of this origin. There may have been\r\nother animal limestone-builders than Eozoon, and there may have been\r\nlimestones formed by plants like the modern Nullipores or by merely\r\nmineral deposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. _Section of a Nummulite, from Eocene Limestone\r\nof Syria._\r\n\r\nShowing chambers, tubuli, and canals. Compare this and fig. 20 with\r\nfigs. 10 and 11.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. _Portion of shell of Calcarina._\r\n\r\nMagnified, after Carpenter. (_a._) Cells. (_b._) Original cell-wall\r\nwith tubuli. (_c._) Supplementary skeleton with canals.]\r\n\r\nIts relations to modern animals of its type have been very clearly\r\ndefined by Dr. Carpenter. In the structure of its proper wall and its\r\nfine parallel perforations, it resembles the _Nummulites_ and their\r\nallies; and the organism may therefore be regarded as an aberrant\r\nmember of the Nummuline group, which affords some of the largest and\r\nmost widely distributed of the fossil Foraminifera. This resemblance\r\nmay be seen in fig. 19. To the Nummulites it also conforms in its\r\ntendency to form a supplemental or intermediate skeleton with canals,\r\nthough the canals themselves in their arrangement more nearly resemble\r\nCalcarina, which is represented in fig. 20. In its superposition of\r\nmany layers, and in its tendency to a heaped up or acervuline irregular\r\ngrowth it resembles _Polytrema_ and _Tinoporus_, forms of a different\r\ngroup in so far as shell-structure is concerned. It may thus be\r\nregarded as a composite type, combining peculiarities now observed in\r\ntwo groups, or it may be regarded as a representative in the Nummuline\r\nseries of Polytrema and Tinoporus in the Rotaline series. At the time\r\nwhen Dr. Carpenter stated these affinities, it might be objected that\r\nForaminifera of these families are in the main found in the Modern and\r\nTertiary periods. Dr. Carpenter has since shown that the curious oval\r\nForaminifer called _Fusulina_, found in the coal formation, is in like\r\nmanner allied to both Nummulites and Rotalines; and still more recently\r\nMr. Brady has discovered a true Nummulite in the Lower Carboniferous of\r\nBelgium. This group being now fairly brought down to the Palæozoic, we\r\nmay hope finally to trace it back to the Primordial, and thus to bring\r\nit still nearer to Eozoon in time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. _Foraminiferal Rock Builders._\r\n\r\n(_a._) Nummulites lævigata--Eocene. (_b._) The same, showing chambered\r\ninterior. (_c._) Milioline limestone, magnified--Eocene, Paris. (_d._)\r\nHard Chalk, section magnified--Cretaceous.]\r\n\r\nThough Eozoon was probably not the only animal of the Laurentian seas,\r\nyet it was in all likelihood the most conspicuous and important as\r\na collector of calcareous matter, filling the same place afterwards\r\noccupied by the reef-building corals. Though probably less efficient\r\nthan these as a constructor of solid limestones, from its less\r\npermanent and continuous growth, it formed wide floors and patches\r\non the sea-bottom, and when these were broken up vast quantities of\r\nlimestone were formed from their debris. It must also be borne in mind\r\nthat Eozoon was not everywhere infiltrated with serpentine or other\r\nsilicious minerals; quantities of its substance were merely filled\r\nwith carbonate of lime, resembling the chamber-wall so closely that\r\nit is nearly impossible to make out the difference, and thus is likely\r\nto pass altogether unobserved by collectors, and to baffle even the\r\nmicroscopist. (Fig. 24.) Although therefore the layers which contain\r\nwell characterized Eozoon are few and far between, there is reason to\r\nbelieve that in the composition of the limestones of the Laurentian\r\nit bore no small part, and as these limestones are some of them\r\nseveral hundreds of feet in thickness, and extend over vast areas,\r\nEozoon may be supposed to have been as efficient a world-builder as\r\nthe Stromatoporæ of the Silurian and Devonian, the Globigerinæ and\r\ntheir allies in the chalk, or the Nummulites and Miliolites in the\r\nEocene. The two latter groups of rock-makers are represented in our\r\ncut, fig. 21; the first will engage our attention in chapter sixth. It\r\nis a remarkable illustration of the constancy of natural causes and of\r\nthe persistence of animal types, that these humble Protozoans, which\r\nbegan to secrete calcareous matter in the Laurentian period, have been\r\ncontinuing their work in the ocean through all the geological ages,\r\nand are still busy in accumulating those chalky muds with which recent\r\ndredging operations in the deep sea have made us so familiar.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A.) Original Description of Eozoon Canadense.\r\n\r\n[As given by the author in the _Journal of the Geological Society_,\r\nFebruary, 1865.]\r\n\r\n  \"At the request of Sir W. E. Logan, I have submitted to microscopic\r\n  examination slices of certain peculiar laminated forms, consisting\r\n  of alternate layers of carbonate of lime and serpentine, and of\r\n  carbonate of lime and white pyroxene, found in the Laurentian\r\n  limestone of Canada, and regarded by Sir William as possibly fossils.\r\n  I have also examined slices of a large number of limestones from the\r\n  Laurentian series, not showing the forms of these supposed fossils.\r\n\r\n  \"The specimens first mentioned are masses, often several inches in\r\n  diameter, presenting to the naked eye alternate laminæ of serpentine,\r\n  or of pyroxene, and carbonate of lime. Their general aspect, as\r\n  remarked by Sir W. E. Logan (_Geology of Canada_, 1863, p. 49),\r\n  reminds the observer of that of the Silurian corals of the genus\r\n  Stromatopora, except that the laminæ diverge from and approach each\r\n  other, and frequently anastomose or are connected by transverse septa.\r\n\r\n  \"Under the microscope the resemblance to Stromatopora is seen to\r\n  be in general form merely, and no trace appears of the radiating\r\n  pillars characteristic of that genus. The laminæ of serpentine and\r\n  pyroxene present no organic structure, and the latter mineral is\r\n  highly crystalline. The laminæ of carbonate of lime, on the contrary,\r\n  retain distinct traces of structures which cannot be of a crystalline\r\n  or concretionary character. They constitute parallel or concentric\r\n  partitions of variable thickness, enclosing flattened spaces or\r\n  chambers, frequently crossed by transverse plates or septa, in some\r\n  places so numerous as to give a vesicular appearance, in others\r\n  occurring only at rare intervals. The laminæ themselves are excavated\r\n  on their sides into rounded pits, and are in some places traversed by\r\n  canals, or contain secondary rounded cells, apparently isolated. In\r\n  addition to these general appearances, the substance of the laminæ,\r\n  where most perfectly preserved, is seen to present a fine granular\r\n  structure, and to be penetrated by numerous minute tubuli, which\r\n  are arranged in bundles of great beauty and complexity, diverging\r\n  in sheaf-like forms, and in their finer extensions anastomosing so\r\n  as to form a network (figs. 10 and 28). In transverse sections, and\r\n  under high powers, the tubuli are seen to be circular in outline, and\r\n  sharply defined (fig. 29). In longitudinal sections, they sometimes\r\n  present a beaded or jointed appearance. Even where the tubular\r\n  structure is least perfectly preserved, traces of it can still be\r\n  seen in most of the slices, though there are places in which the\r\n  laminæ are perfectly compact, and perhaps were so originally.\r\n\r\n  \"With respect to the nature and probable origin of the appearances\r\n  above described, I would make the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n  \"1. The serpentine and pyroxene which fill the cavities of the\r\n  calcareous matter have no appearance of concretionary structure.\r\n  On the contrary, their aspect is that of matter introduced by\r\n  infiltration, or as sediment, and filling spaces previously existing.\r\n  In other words, the calcareous matter has not been moulded on the\r\n  forms of the serpentine and augite, but these have filled spaces\r\n  or chambers in a hard calcareous mass. This conclusion is further\r\n  confirmed by the fact, to be referred to in the sequel, that the\r\n  serpentine includes multitudes of minute foreign bodies, while the\r\n  calcareous matter is uniform and homogeneous. It is also to be\r\n  observed that small veins of carbonate of lime occasionally traverse\r\n  the specimen's, and in their entire absence of structures other than\r\n  crystalline, present a striking contrast to the supposed fossils.\r\n\r\n  \"2. Though the calcareous laminæ have in places a crystalline\r\n  cleavage, their forms and structures have no relation to this. Their\r\n  cells and canals are rounded, and have smooth walls, which are\r\n  occasionally lined with films apparently of carbonaceous matter.\r\n  Above all, the minute tubuli are different from anything likely to\r\n  occur in merely crystalline calc-spar. While in such rocks little\r\n  importance might be attached to external forms simulating the\r\n  appearances of corals, sponges, or other organisms, these delicate\r\n  internal structures have a much higher claim to attention. Nor is\r\n  there any improbability in the preservation of such minute parts in\r\n  rocks so highly crystalline, since it is a circumstance of frequent\r\n  occurrence in the microscopic examination of fossils that the finest\r\n  structures are visible in specimens in which the general form and the\r\n  arrangement of parts have been obliterated. It is also to be observed\r\n  that the structure of the calcareous laminæ is the same, whether the\r\n  intervening spaces are filled with serpentine or with pyroxene.\r\n\r\n  \"3. The structures above described are not merely definite and\r\n  uniform, but they are of a kind proper to animal organisms, and\r\n  more especially to one particular type of animal life, as likely as\r\n  any other to occur under such circumstances: I refer to that of the\r\n  Rhizopods of the order Foraminifera. The most important point of\r\n  difference is in the great size and compact habit of growth of the\r\n  specimens in question; but there seems no good reason to maintain\r\n  that Foraminifera must necessarily be of small size, more especially\r\n  since forms of considerable magnitude referred to this type are known\r\n  in the Lower Silurian. Professor Hall has described specimens of\r\n  Receptaculites twelve inches in diameter; and the fossils from the\r\n  Potsdam formation of Labrador, referred by Mr. Billings to the genus\r\n  Archæocyathus, are examples of Protozoa with calcareous skeletons\r\n  scarcely inferior in their massive style of growth to the forms now\r\n  under consideration.\r\n\r\n  \"These reasons are, I think, sufficient to justify me in regarding\r\n  these remarkable structures as truly organic, and in searching for\r\n  their nearest allies among the Foraminifera.\r\n\r\n  \"Supposing then that the spaces between the calcareous laminæ, as\r\n  well as the canals and tubuli traversing their substance, were once\r\n  filled with the sarcode body of a Rhizopod, comparisons with modern\r\n  forms at once suggest themselves.\r\n\r\n  \"From the polished specimens in the Museum of the Canadian Geological\r\n  Survey, it appears certain that these bodies were sessile by a broad\r\n  base, and grew by the addition of successive layers of chambers\r\n  separated by calcareous laminæ, but communicating with each other by\r\n  canals or septal orifices sparsely and irregularly distributed. Small\r\n  specimens have thus much the aspect of the modern genera Carpenteria\r\n  and Polytrema. Like the first of these genera, there would also seem\r\n  to have been a tendency to leave in the midst of the structure a\r\n  large central canal, or deep funnel-shaped or cylindrical opening,\r\n  for communication with the sea-water. Where the laminæ coalesce, and\r\n  the structure becomes more vesicular, it assumes the 'acervuline'\r\n  character seen in such modern forms as Nubecularia.\r\n\r\n  \"Still the magnitude of these fossils is enormous when compared with\r\n  the species of the genera above named; and from the specimens in the\r\n  larger slabs from Grenville, in the museum of the Canadian Survey,\r\n  it would seem that these organisms grew in groups, which ultimately\r\n  coalesced, and formed large masses penetrated by deep irregular\r\n  canals; and that they continued to grow at the surface, while the\r\n  lower parts became dead and were filled up with infiltrated matter or\r\n  sediment. In short, we have to imagine an organism having the habit\r\n  of growth of Carpenteria, but attaining to an enormous size, and by\r\n  the aggregation of individuals assuming the aspect of a coral reef.\r\n\r\n  \"The complicated systems of tubuli in the Laurentian fossil indicate,\r\n  however, a more complex structure than that of any of the forms\r\n  mentioned above. I have carefully compared these with the similar\r\n  structures in the 'supplementary skeleton' (or the shell-substance\r\n  that carries the vascular system) of Calcarina and other forms, and\r\n  can detect no difference except in the somewhat coarser texture of\r\n  the tubuli in the Laurentian specimens. It accords well with the\r\n  great dimensions of these, that they should thus thicken their walls\r\n  with an extensive deposit of tubulated calcareous matter; and from\r\n  the frequency of the bundles of tubuli, as well as from the thickness\r\n  of the partitions, I have no doubt that all the successive walls, as\r\n  they were formed, were thickened in this manner, just as in so many\r\n  of the higher genera of more modern Foraminifera.\r\n\r\n  \"It is proper to add that no spicules, or other structures indicating\r\n  affinity to the Sponges, have been detected in any of the specimens.\r\n\r\n  \"As it is convenient to have a name to designate these forms, I\r\n  would propose that of Eozoon, which will be specially appropriate to\r\n  what seems to be the characteristic fossil of a group of rocks which\r\n  must now be named Eozoic rather than Azoic. For the species above\r\n  described, the specific name of Canadense has been proposed. It may\r\n  be distinguished by the following characters:--\r\n\r\n  \"Eozoon Canadense; _gen. et spec. nov._\r\n\r\n  \"_General form._--Massive, in large sessile patches or irregular\r\n  cylinders, growing at the surface by the addition of successive\r\n  laminæ.\r\n\r\n  \"_Internal structure._--Chambers large, flattened, irregular, with\r\n  numerous rounded extensions, and separated by walls of variable\r\n  thickness, which are penetrated by septal orifices irregularly\r\n  disposed. Thicker parts of the walls with bundles of fine branching\r\n  tubuli.\r\n\r\n  \"These characters refer specially to the specimens from Grenville and\r\n  the Calumet. There are others from Perth, C. W., which show more\r\n  regular laminæ, and in which the tubuli have not yet been observed;\r\n  and a specimen from Burgess, C. W., contains some fragments of laminæ\r\n  which exhibit, on one side, a series of fine parallel tubuli like\r\n  those of Nummulina. These specimens may indicate distinct species;\r\n  but on the other hand, their peculiarities may depend on different\r\n  states of preservation.\r\n\r\n  \"With respect to this last point, it may be remarked that some of\r\n  the specimens from Grenville and the Calumet show the structure of\r\n  the laminæ with nearly equal distinctness, whether the chambers are\r\n  filled with serpentine or pyroxene, and that even the minute tubuli\r\n  are penetrated and filled with these minerals. On the other hand,\r\n  there are large specimens in the collection of the Canadian Survey\r\n  in which the lower and still parts of the organism are imperfectly\r\n  preserved in pyroxene, while the upper parts are more perfectly\r\n  mineralized with serpentine.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [The following note was added in a reprint of the paper in the\r\n  _Canadian Naturalist_, April, 1865.]\r\n\r\n  \"Since the above was written, thick slices of Eozoon from Grenville\r\n  have been prepared, and submitted to the action of hydrochloric acid\r\n  until the carbonate of lime was removed. The serpentine then remains\r\n  as a cast of the interior of the chambers, showing the form of their\r\n  original sarcode-contents. The minute tubuli are found also to have\r\n  been filled with a substance insoluble in the acid, so that casts\r\n  of these also remain in great perfection, and allow their general\r\n  distribution to be much better seen than in the transparent slices\r\n  previously prepared. These interesting preparations establish the\r\n  following additional structural points:--\r\n\r\n  \"1. That the whole mass of sarcode throughout the organism was\r\n  continuous; the apparently detached secondary chambers being, as\r\n  I had previously suspected, connected with the larger chambers by\r\n  canals filled with sarcode.\r\n\r\n  \"2. That some of the irregular portions without lamination are not\r\n  fragmentary, but due to the acervuline growth of the animal; and that\r\n  this irregularity has been produced in part by the formation of\r\n  projecting patches of supplementary skeleton, penetrated by beautiful\r\n  systems of tubuli. These groups of tubuli are in some places very\r\n  regular, and have in their axes cylinders of compact calcareous\r\n  matter. Some parts of the specimens present arrangements of this kind\r\n  as symmetrical as in any modern Foraminiferal shell.\r\n\r\n  \"3. That all except the very thinnest portions of the walls of\r\n  the chambers present traces, more or less distinct, of a tubular\r\n  structure.\r\n\r\n  \"4. These facts place in more strong contrast the structure of\r\n  the regularly laminated species from Burgess, which do not show\r\n  tubuli, and that of the Grenville specimens, less regularly\r\n  laminated and tubulous throughout. I hesitated however to regard\r\n  these two as distinct species, in consequence of the intermediate\r\n  characters presented by specimens from the Calumet, which are\r\n  regularly laminated like those of Burgess, and tubulous like those\r\n  of Grenville. It is possible that in the Burgess specimens, tubuli,\r\n  originally present, have been obliterated, and in organisms of this\r\n  grade, more or less altered by the processes of fossilisation, large\r\n  series of specimens should be compared before attempting to establish\r\n  specific distinctions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(B.) Original Description of the Specimens added by Dr. Carpenter to\r\nthe above--in a Letter to Sir W. E. Logan.\r\n\r\n[_Journal of Geological Society_, February, 1865.]\r\n\r\n  \"The careful examination which I have made, in accordance with\r\n  the request you were good enough to convey to me from Dr. Dawson\r\n  and to second on your own part, with the structure of the very\r\n  extraordinary fossil which you have brought from the Laurentian\r\n  rocks of Canada,[Q] enables me most unhesitatingly to confirm the\r\n  sagacious determination of Dr. Dawson as to its Rhizopod characters\r\n  and Foraminiferal affinities, and at the same time furnishes new\r\n  evidence of no small value in support of that determination. In\r\n  this examination I have had the advantage of a series of sections\r\n  of the fossil much superior to those submitted to Dr. Dawson; and\r\n  also of a large series of decalcified specimens, of which Dr. Dawson\r\n  had only the opportunity of seeing a few examples after his memoir\r\n  had been written. These last are peculiarly instructive; since\r\n  in consequence of the complete infiltration of the chambers and\r\n  canals, originally occupied by the sarcode-body of the animal, by\r\n  mineral matter insoluble in dilute nitric acid, the removal of the\r\n  calcareous shell brings into view, not only the internal casts of\r\n  the chambers, but also casts of the interior of the 'canal system'\r\n  of the 'intermediate' or 'supplemental skeleton,' and even casts of\r\n  the interior of the very fine parallel tubuli which traverse the\r\n  proper walls of the chambers. And, as I have remarked elsewhere,[R]\r\n  'such casts place before us far more exact representations of the\r\n  configuration of the animal body, and of the connections of its\r\n  different parts, than we could obtain even from living specimens by\r\n  dissolving away their shells with acid; its several portions being\r\n  disposed to heap themselves together in a mass when they lose the\r\n  support of the calcareous skeleton.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote Q: The specimens submitted to Dr. Carpenter were taken from a\r\nblock of Eozoon rock, obtained in the Petite Nation seigniory, too late\r\nto afford Dr. Dawson an opportunity of examination. They are from the\r\nsame horizon as the Grenville specimens.--W. E. L.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote R: _Introduction to the Study of the Foraminifera_, p. 10.]\r\n\r\n  \"The additional opportunities I have thus enjoyed will be found,\r\n  I believe, to account satisfactorily for the differences to be\r\n  observed between Dr. Dawson's account of the Eozoon and my own. Had\r\n  I been obliged to form my conclusions respecting its structure only\r\n  from the specimens submitted to Dr. Dawson, I should very probably\r\n  have seen no reason for any but the most complete accordance with\r\n  his description: while if Dr. Dawson had enjoyed the advantage of\r\n  examining the entire series of preparations which have come under my\r\n  own observation, I feel confident that he would have anticipated the\r\n  corrections and additions which I now offer.\r\n\r\n  \"Although the general plan of growth described by Dr. Dawson, and\r\n  exhibited in his photographs of vertical sections of the fossil,\r\n  is undoubtedly that which is typical of Eozoon, yet I find that\r\n  the acervuline mode of growth, also mentioned by Dr. Dawson, very\r\n  frequently takes its place in the more superficial parts, where\r\n  the chambers, which are arranged in regular tiers in the laminated\r\n  portions, are heaped one upon another without any regularity, as is\r\n  particularly well shown in some decalcified specimens which I have\r\n  myself prepared from the slices last put into my hands. I see no\r\n  indication that this departure from the normal type of structure\r\n  has resulted from an injury; the transition from the regular to the\r\n  irregular mode of increase not being abrupt but gradual. Nor shall I\r\n  be disposed to regard it as a monstrosity; since there are many other\r\n  Foraminifera in which an originally definite plan of growth gives\r\n  place, in a later stage, to a like acervuline piling-up of chambers.\r\n\r\n  \"In regard to the form and relations of the chambers, I have little\r\n  to add to Dr. Dawson's description. The evidence afforded by their\r\n  internal casts concurs with that of sections, in showing that the\r\n  segments of the sarcode-body, by whose aggregation each layer was\r\n  constituted, were but very incompletely divided by shelly partitions;\r\n  this incomplete separation (as Dr. Dawson has pointed out) having\r\n  its parallel in that of the secondary chambers in Carpenteria. But I\r\n  have occasionally met with instances in which the separation of the\r\n  chambers has been as complete as it is in Foraminifera generally; and\r\n  the communication between them is then established by several narrow\r\n  passages exactly corresponding with those which I have described and\r\n  figured in Cycloclypeus.[S]\r\n\r\n[Footnote S: _Op. cit._, p. 294.]\r\n\r\n  \"The mode in which each successive layer originates from the one\r\n  which had preceded it, is a question to which my attention has been\r\n  a good deal directed; but I do not as yet feel confident that I\r\n  have been able to elucidate it completely. There is certainly no\r\n  regular system of apertures for the passage of stolons giving origin\r\n  to new segments, such as are found in all ordinary Polythalamous\r\n  Foraminifera, whether their type of growth be rectilinear, spiral,\r\n  or cyclical; and I am disposed to believe that where one layer is\r\n  separated from another by nothing else than the proper walls of\r\n  the chambers,--which, as I shall presently show, are traversed by\r\n  multitudes of minute tubuli giving passage to pseudopodia,--the\r\n  coalescence of these pseudopodia on the external surface would\r\n  suffice to lay the foundation of a new layer of sarcodic segments.\r\n  But where an intermediate or supplemental skeleton, consisting of a\r\n  thick layer of solid calcareous shell, has been deposited between\r\n  two successive layers, it is obvious that the animal body contained\r\n  in the lower layer of chambers must be completely cut off from\r\n  that which occupies the upper, unless some special provision exist\r\n  for their mutual communication. Such a provision I believe to have\r\n  been made by the extension of bands of sarcode, through canals left\r\n  in the intermediate skeleton, from the lower to the upper tier of\r\n  chambers. For in such sections as happen to have traversed thick\r\n  deposits of the intermediate skeleton, there are generally found\r\n  passages distinguished from those of the ordinary canal-system by\r\n  their broad flat form, their great transverse diameter, and their\r\n  non-ramification. One of these passages I have distinctly traced\r\n  to a chamber, with the cavity of which it communicated through two\r\n  or three apertures in its proper wall; and I think it likely that\r\n  I should have been able to trace it at its other extremity into a\r\n  chamber of the superjacent tier, had not the plane of the section\r\n  passed out of its course. Riband-like casts of these passages are\r\n  often to be seen in decalcified specimens, traversing the void spaces\r\n  left by the removal of the thickest layers of the intermediate\r\n  skeleton.\r\n\r\n  \"But the organization of a new layer seems to have not unfrequently\r\n  taken place in a much more considerable extension of the sarcode-body\r\n  of the pre-formed layer; which either folded back its margin\r\n  over the surface already consolidated, in a manner somewhat like\r\n  that in which the mantle of a Cyprœa doubles back to deposit\r\n  the final surface-layer of its shell, or sent upwards wall-like\r\n  lamellæ, sometimes of very limited extent, but not unfrequently of\r\n  considerable length, which, after traversing the substance of the\r\n  shell, like trap-dykes in a bed of sandstone, spread themselves out\r\n  over its surface. Such, at least, are the only interpretations I can\r\n  put upon the appearances presented by decalcified specimens. For\r\n  on the one hand, it is frequently to be observed that two bands of\r\n  serpentine (or other infiltrated mineral), which represent two layers\r\n  of the original sarcode-body of the animal, approximate to each other\r\n  in some part of their course, and come into complete continuity;\r\n  so that the upper layer would seem at that part to have had its\r\n  origin in the lower. Again, even where these bands are most widely\r\n  separated, we find that they are commonly held together by vertical\r\n  lamellæ of the same material, sometimes forming mere tongues, but\r\n  often running to a considerable length. That these lamellæ have not\r\n  been formed by mineral infiltration into accidental fissures in the\r\n  shell, but represent corresponding extensions of the sarcode-body,\r\n  seems to me to be indicated not merely by the characters of their\r\n  surface, but also by the fact that portions of the canal-system may\r\n  be occasionally traced into connection with them.\r\n\r\n  \"Although Dr. Dawson has noticed that some parts of the sections\r\n  which he examined present the fine tubulation characteristic of\r\n  the shells of the Nummuline Foraminifera, he does not seem to have\r\n  recognised the fact, which the sections placed in my hands have\r\n  enabled me most satisfactorily to determine,--that the proper\r\n  walls of the chambers everywhere present the fine tubulation of\r\n  the Nummuline shell; a point of the highest importance in the\r\n  determination of the affinities of Eozoon. This tubulation, although\r\n  not seen with the clearness with which it is to be discerned in\r\n  recent examples of the Nummuline type, is here far better displayed\r\n  than it is in the majority of fossil Nummulites, in which the\r\n  tubuli have been filled up by the infiltration of calcareous\r\n  matter, rendering the shell-substance nearly homogeneous. In Eozoon\r\n  these tubuli have been filled up by the infiltration of a mineral\r\n  different from that of which the shell is composed, and therefore\r\n  not coalescing with it; and the tubular structure is consequently\r\n  much more satisfactorily distinguishable. In decalcified specimens,\r\n  the free margins of the casts of the chambers are often seen to be\r\n  bordered with a delicate white glistening fringe; and when this\r\n  fringe is examined with a sufficient magnifying power, it is seen to\r\n  be made up of a multitude of extremely delicate aciculi, standing\r\n  side by side like the fibres of asbestos. These, it is obvious, are\r\n  the internal casts of the fine tubuli which perforated the proper\r\n  wall of the chambers, passing directly from its inner to its outer\r\n  surface; and their presence in this situation affords the most\r\n  satisfactory confirmation of the evidence of that tubulation afforded\r\n  by thin sections of the shell-wall.\r\n\r\n  \"The successive layers, each having its own proper wall, are\r\n  often superposed one upon another without the intervention of any\r\n  supplemental or intermediate skeleton such as presents itself in\r\n  all the more massive forms of the Nummuline series; but a deposit\r\n  of this form of shell-substance, readily distinguishable by its\r\n  homogeneousness from the finely tubular shell immediately investing\r\n  the segments of the sarcode-body, is the source of the great\r\n  thickening which the calcareous zones often present in vertical\r\n  sections of Eozoon. The presence of this intermediate skeleton has\r\n  been correctly indicated by Dr. Dawson; but he does not seem to have\r\n  clearly differentiated it from the proper wall of the chambers.\r\n  All the tubuli which he has described belong to that canal system\r\n  which, as I have shown,[T] is limited in its distribution to the\r\n  intermediate skeleton, and is expressly designed to supply a channel\r\n  for its nutrition and augmentation. Of this canal system, which\r\n  presents most remarkable varieties in dimensions and distribution, we\r\n  learn more from the casts presented by decalcified specimens, than\r\n  from sections, which only exhibit such parts of it as their plane may\r\n  happen to traverse. Illustrations from both sources, giving a more\r\n  complete representation of it than Dr. Dawson's figures afford, have\r\n  been prepared from the additional specimens placed in my hands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote T: _Op. cit._, pp. 50, 51.]\r\n\r\n  \"It does not appear to me that the canal system takes its origin\r\n  directly from the cavity of the chambers. On the contrary, I believe\r\n  that, as in Calcarina (which Dr. Dawson has correctly referred to as\r\n  presenting the nearest parallel to it among recent Foraminifera),\r\n  they originate in lacunar spaces on the outside of the proper\r\n  walls of the chambers, into which the tubuli of those walls open\r\n  externally; and that the extensions of the sarcode-body which\r\n  occupied them were formed by the coalescence of the pseudopodia\r\n  issuing from those tubuli.[U]\r\n\r\n[Footnote U: _Op. cit._, p. 221.]\r\n\r\n  \"It seems to me worthy of special notice, that the canal system,\r\n  wherever displayed in transparent sections, is distinguished by a\r\n  yellowish brown coloration, so exactly resembling that which I have\r\n  observed in the canal system of recent Foraminifera (as Polystomella\r\n  and Calcarina) in which there were remains of the sarcode-body, that\r\n  I cannot but believe the infiltrating mineral to have been dyed by\r\n  the remains of sarcode still existing in the canals of Eozoon at the\r\n  time of its consolidation. If this be the case, the preservation\r\n  of this colour seems to indicate that no considerable metamorphic\r\n  action has been exerted upon the rock in which this fossil occurs.\r\n  And I should draw the same inference from the fact that the organic\r\n  structure of the shell is in many instances even more completely\r\n  preserved than it usually is in the Nummulites and other Foraminifera\r\n  of the Nummulitic limestone of the early Tertiaries.\r\n\r\n  \"To sum up,--That the _Eozoon_ finds its proper place in the\r\n  Foraminiferal series, I conceive to be conclusively proved by its\r\n  accordance with the great types of that series, in all the essential\r\n  characters of organization;--namely, the structure of the shell\r\n  forming the proper wall of the chambers, in which it agrees precisely\r\n  with Nummulina and its allies; the presence of an intermediate\r\n  skeleton and an elaborate canal system, the disposition of which\r\n  reminds us most of Calcarina; a mode of communication of the chambers\r\n  when they are most completely separated, which has its exact parallel\r\n  in Cycloclypeus; and an ordinary want of completeness of separation\r\n  between the chambers, corresponding with that which is characteristic\r\n  of Carpenteria.\r\n\r\n  \"There is no other group of the animal kingdom to which Eozoon\r\n  presents the slightest structural resemblance; and to the suggestion\r\n  that it may have been of kin to Nullipore, I can offer the most\r\n  distinct negative reply, having many years ago carefully studied the\r\n  structure of that stony Alga, with which that of Eozoon has nothing\r\n  whatever in common.\r\n\r\n  \"The objections which not unnaturally occur to those familiar with\r\n  only the ordinary forms of Foraminifera, as to the admission of\r\n  Eozoon into the series, do not appear to me of any force. These have\r\n  reference in the first place to the great _size_ of the organism; and\r\n  in the second, to its exceptional mode of growth.\r\n\r\n  \"1. It must be borne in mind that all the Foraminifera normally\r\n  increase by the continuous gemmation of new segments from those\r\n  previously formed; and that we have, in the existing types, the\r\n  greatest diversities in the extent to which this gemmation may\r\n  proceed. Thus in the Globigerinæ, whose shells cover to an unknown\r\n  thickness the sea bottom of all that portion of the Atlantic Ocean\r\n  which is traversed by the Gulf Stream, only eight or ten segments\r\n  are ordinarily produced by continuous gemmation; and if new segments\r\n  are developed from the last of these, they detach themselves so\r\n  as to lay the foundation of independent Globigerinæ. On the other\r\n  hand in Cycloclypeus, which is a discoidal structure attaining two\r\n  and a quarter inches in diameter, the number of segments formed by\r\n  continuous gemmation must be many thousand. Again, the Receptaculites\r\n  of the Canadian Silurian rocks, shown by Mr. Salter's drawings[V]\r\n  to be a gigantic Orbitolite, attains a diameter of twelve inches;\r\n  and if this were to increase by vertical as well as by horizontal\r\n  gemmation (after the manner of Tinoporus or Orbitoides) so that one\r\n  discoidal layer would be piled on another, it would form a mass\r\n  equalling Eozoon in its ordinary dimensions. To say, therefore, that\r\n  Eozoon cannot belong to the Foraminifera on account of its gigantic\r\n  size, is much as if a botanist who had only studied plants and\r\n  shrubs were to refuse to admit a tree into the same category. The\r\n  very same continuous gemmation which has produced an Eozoon would\r\n  produce an equal mass of independent Globigerinæ, if after eight\r\n  or ten repetitions of the process, the new segments were to detach\r\n  themselves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote V: _First Decade of Canadian Fossils_, pl. x.]\r\n\r\n  \"It is to be remembered, moreover, that the largest masses of sponges\r\n  are formed by continuous gemmation from an original Rhizopod segment;\r\n  and that there is no _à priori_ reason why a Foraminiferal organism\r\n  should not attain the same dimensions as a Poriferal one,--the\r\n  intimate relationship of the two groups, notwithstanding the\r\n  difference between their skeletons, being unquestionable.\r\n\r\n  \"2. The difficulty arising from the zoophytic plan of growth of\r\n  Eozoon is at once disposed of by the fact that we have in the recent\r\n  Polytrema (as I have shown, _op. cit._, p. 235) an organism nearly\r\n  allied in all essential points of structure to Rotalia, yet no\r\n  less aberrant in its plan of growth, having been ranked by Lamarck\r\n  among the Millepores. And it appears to me that Eozoon takes its\r\n  place quite as naturally in the Nummuline series as Polytrema in\r\n  the Rotaline. As we are led from the typical Rotalia, through the\r\n  less regular Planorbulina, to Tinoporus, in which the chambers are\r\n  piled up vertically, as well as multiplied horizontally, and thence\r\n  pass by an easy gradation to Polytrema, in which all regularity of\r\n  external form is lost; so may we pass from the typical Operculina or\r\n  Nummulina, through Heterostegina and Cycloclypeus to Orbitoides, in\r\n  which, as in Tinoporus, the chambers multiply both by horizontal and\r\n  by vertical gemmation; and from Orbitoides to Eozoon the transition\r\n  is scarcely more abrupt than from Tinoporus to Polytrema.\r\n\r\n  \"The general acceptance, by the most competent judges, of my views\r\n  respecting the primary value of the characters furnished by the\r\n  intimate structure of the shell, and the very subordinate value\r\n  of plan of growth, in the determination of the affinities of\r\n  Foraminifera, renders it unnecessary that I should dwell further on\r\n  my reasons for unhesitatingly affirming the Nummuline affinities of\r\n  Eozoon from the microscopic appearances presented by the proper wall\r\n  of its chambers, notwithstanding its very aberrant peculiarities;\r\n  and I cannot but feel it to be a feature of peculiar interest in\r\n  geological inquiry, that the true relations of by far the earliest\r\n  fossil yet known should be determinable by the comparison of a\r\n  portion which the smallest pin's head would cover, with organisms at\r\n  present existing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(C.) Note on Specimens From Long Lake and Wentworth.\r\n\r\n[_Journal of Geological Society_, August, 1867.]\r\n\r\n  \"Specimens from Long Lake, in the collection of the Geological\r\n  Survey of Canada, exhibit white crystalline limestone with light\r\n  green compact or septariiform[W] serpentine, and much resemble some\r\n  of the serpentine limestones of Grenville. Under the microscope the\r\n  calcareous matter presents a delicate areolated appearance, without\r\n  lamination; but it is not an example of acervuline Eozoon, but rather\r\n  of fragments of such a structure, confusedly aggregated together, and\r\n  having the interstices and cell-cavities filled with serpentine. I\r\n  have not found in any of these fragments a canal system similar to\r\n  that of Eozoon Canadense, though there are casts of large stolons,\r\n  and, under a high power, the calcareous matter shows in many places\r\n  the peculiar granular or cellular appearance which is one of the\r\n  characters of the supplemental skeleton of that species. In a few\r\n  places a tubulated cell-wall is preserved, with structure similar to\r\n  that of Eozoon Canadense.\r\n\r\n[Footnote W: I use the term \"septariiform\" to denote the _curdled_\r\nappearance so often presented by the Laurentian serpentine.]\r\n\r\n  \"Specimens of Laurentian limestone from Wentworth, in the collection\r\n  of the Geological Survey, exhibit many rounded silicious bodies, some\r\n  of which are apparently grains of sand, or small pebbles; but others,\r\n  especially when freed from the calcareous matter by a dilute acid,\r\n  appear as rounded bodies, with rough surfaces, either separate or\r\n  aggregated in lines or groups, and having minute vermicular processes\r\n  projecting from their surfaces. At first sight these suggest the\r\n  idea of spicules; but I think it on the whole more likely that\r\n  they are casts of cavities and tubes belonging to some calcareous\r\n  Foraminiferal organism which has disappeared. Similar bodies, found\r\n  in the limestone of Bavaria, have been described by Gümbel, who\r\n  interprets them in the same way. They may also be compared with the\r\n  silicious bodies mentioned in a former paper as occurring in the\r\n  loganite filling the chambers of specimens of _Eozoon_ from Burgess.\"\r\n\r\n  These specimens will be more fully referred to under Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n(D.) Additional Structural Facts.\r\n\r\n  I may mention here a peculiar and interesting structure which has\r\n  been detected in one of my specimens while these sheets were passing\r\n  through the press. It is an abnormal thickening of the calcareous\r\n  wall, extending across several layers, and perforated with large\r\n  parallel cylindrical canals, filled with dolomite, and running in\r\n  the direction of the laminæ; the intervening calcite being traversed\r\n  by a very fine and delicate canal system. It makes a nearer approach\r\n  to some of the Stromatoporæ mentioned in Chapter VI. than any other\r\n  Laurentian structure hitherto observed, and may be either an abnormal\r\n  growth of Eozoon, consequent on some injury, or a parasitic mass of\r\n  some Stromatoporoid organism overgrown by the laminæ of the fossil.\r\n  The structure of the dolomite in this specimen indicates that it\r\n  first lined the canals, and afterward filled them; an appearance\r\n  which I have also observed recently in the larger canals filled\r\n  with serpentine (Plate VIII., fig. 5). The cut below is an attempt,\r\n  only partially successful, to show the Amœba-like appearance, when\r\n  magnified, of the casts of the chambers of Eozoon, as seen on the\r\n  decalcified surface of a specimen broken parallel to the laminæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21_a_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                                                               Plate V.\r\n\r\n_Nature-print of Eozoon, showing laminated, acervuline, and fragmental\r\n                              portions._\r\n\r\nThis is printed from an electrotype taken from an etched slab of\r\nEozoon, and not touched with a graver except to remedy some accidental\r\nflaws in the plate.

I call this a prejudice, because any one who makes the\r\nmicroscopic structure of rocks and fossils a special study, soon learns\r\nthat fossils undergo the most remarkable and complete chemical changes\r\nwithout losing their minute structure, and that calcareous rocks if\r\nonce fossiliferous are hardly ever so much altered as to lose all\r\ntrace of the organisms which they contained, while it is a most common\r\noccurrence to find highly crystalline rocks of this kind abounding in\r\nfossils preserved as to their minute structure.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, look at the precise conditions under which this takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWhen calcareous fossils of irregular surface and porous or cellular\r\ntexture, such as Eozoon was or corals were and are, become imbedded\r\nin clay, marl, or other soft sediment, they can be washed out and\r\nrecovered in a condition similar to that of recent specimens, except\r\nthat their pores or cells if open may be filled with the material of\r\nthe matrix, or if not so open that they can be thus filled, they may be\r\nmore or less incrusted with mineral deposits introduced by water, or\r\nmay even be completely filled up in this way. But if such fossils are\r\ncontained in hard rocks, they usually fail, when these are broken, to\r\nshow their external surfaces, and, breaking across with the containing\r\nrock, they exhibit their internal structure merely,--and this more\r\nor less distinctly, according to the manner in which their cells or\r\ncavities have been filled. Here the microscope becomes of essential\r\nservice, especially when the structures are minute. A fragment of\r\nfossil wood which to the naked eye is nothing but a dark stone, or a\r\ncoral which is merely a piece of gray or coloured marble, or a specimen\r\nof common crystalline limestone made up originally of coral fragments,\r\npresents, when sliced and magnified, the most perfect and beautiful\r\nstructure. In such cases it will be found that ordinarily the original\r\nsubstance of the fossil remains, in a more or less altered state. Wood\r\nmay be represented by dark lines of coaly matter, or coral by its\r\nwhite or transparent calcareous laminæ; while the material which has\r\nbeen introduced and which fills the cavities may so differ in colour,\r\ntransparency, or crystalline structure, as to act differently on\r\nlight, and so reveal the structure. These fillings are very curious.\r\nSometimes they are mere earthy or muddy matter. Sometimes they are\r\npure and transparent and crystalline. Often they are stained with\r\noxide of iron or coaly matter. They may consist of carbonate of lime,\r\nsilica or silicates, sulphate of baryta, oxides of iron, carbonate of\r\niron, iron pyrite, or sulphides of copper or lead, all of which are\r\ncommon materials. They are sometimes so complicated that I have seen\r\neven the minute cells of woody structures, each with several bands of\r\ndifferently coloured materials deposited in succession, like the coats\r\nof an onyx agate.\r\n\r\nA further stage of mineralization occurs when the substance of the\r\norganism is altogether removed and replaced by foreign matter, either\r\nlittle by little, or by being entirely dissolved or decomposed,\r\nleaving a cavity to be filled by infiltration. In this state are some\r\nsilicified woods, and those corals which have been not filled with but\r\nconverted into silica, and can thus sometimes be obtained entire and\r\nperfect by the solution in an acid of the containing limestone, or by\r\nits removal in weathering. In this state are the beautiful silicified\r\ncorals obtained from the corniferous limestone of Lake Erie. It may be\r\nwell to present to the eye these different stages of fossilization. I\r\nhave attempted to do this in fig. 22, taking a tabulate coral of the\r\ngenus Favosites for an example, and supposing the materials employed to\r\nbe calcite and silica. Precisely the same illustration would apply to a\r\npiece of wood, except that the cell-wall would be carbonaceous matter\r\ninstead of carbonate of lime. In this figure the dotted parts represent\r\ncarbonate of lime, the diagonally shaded parts silica or a silicate.\r\nThus we have, in the natural state, the walls of carbonate of lime\r\nand the cavities empty. When fossilized the cavities may be merely\r\nfilled with carbonate of lime, or they may be filled with silica; or\r\nthe walls themselves may be replaced by silica and the cavities may\r\nremain filled with carbonate of lime; or both the walls and cavities\r\nmay be represented by or filled with silica or silicates. The ordinary\r\nspecimens of Eozoon are in the third of these stages, though some exist\r\nin the second, and I have reason to believe that some have reached to\r\nthe fifth. I have not met with any in the fourth stage, though this is\r\nnot uncommon in Silurian and Devonian fossils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22. _Diagram showing different States of\r\nFossilization of a Cell of a Tabulate Coral._\r\n\r\n(_a._) Natural condition--walls calcite, cell empty. (_b._) Walls\r\ncalcite, cell filled with the same. (_c._) Walls calcite, cell filled\r\nwith silica or silicate. (_d._) Walls silicified, cell filled with\r\ncalcite. (_e._) Walls silicified, cell filled with silica or silicate.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the calcareous organisms with which we have now to do,\r\nwhen these are imbedded in pure limestone and filled with the same, so\r\nthat the whole rock, fossils and all, is identical in composition, and\r\nwhen metamorphic action has caused the whole to become crystalline,\r\nand perhaps removed the remains of carbonaceous matter, it may be very\r\ndifficult to detect any traces of fossils. But even in this case\r\ncareful management of light may reveal indications of structure, as in\r\nsome specimens of Eozoon described by the writer and Dr. Carpenter. In\r\nmany cases, however, even where the limestones have become perfectly\r\ncrystalline, and the cleavage planes cut freely across the fossils,\r\nthese exhibit their forms and minute structure in great perfection.\r\nThis is the case in many of the Lower Silurian limestones of Canada,\r\nas I have elsewhere shown.[X] The gray crystalline Trenton limestone\r\nof Montreal, used as a building stone, is an excellent illustration\r\nof this. To the naked eye it is a gray marble composed of cleavable\r\ncrystals; but when examined in thin slices, it shows its organic\r\nfragments in the greatest perfection, and all the minute structures\r\nare perfectly marked out by delicate carbonaceous lines. The only\r\nexception in this limestone is in the case of the Crinoids, in which\r\nthe cellular structure is filled with transparent calc-spar, perfectly\r\nidentical with the original solid matter, so that they appear solid\r\nand homogeneous, and can be recognised only by their external forms.\r\nThe specimen represented in fig. 23, is a mass of Corals, Bryozoa, and\r\nCrinoids, and shows these under a low power, as represented in the\r\nfigure; but to the naked eye it is merely a gray crystalline limestone.\r\nThe specimen represented in fig. 24 shows the Laurentian Eozoon in a\r\nsimilar state of preservation. It is from a sketch by Dr. Carpenter,\r\nand shows the delicate canals partly filled with calcite as clear and\r\ncolourless as that of the shell itself, and distinguishable only by\r\ncareful management of the light.\r\n\r\n[Footnote X: _Canadian Naturalist_, 1859; Microscopic Structure of\r\nCanadian Limestones.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. _Slice of Crystalline Lower Silurian Limestone;\r\nshowing Crinoids, Bryozoa, and Corals in fragments._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. _Wall of Eozoon penetrated with Canals. The\r\nunshaded portions filled with Calcite._ (_After Carpenter._)]\r\n\r\nIn the case of recent and fossil Foraminifers, these--when not so\r\nlittle mineralized that their chambers are empty, or only partially\r\nfilled, which is sometimes the case even with Eocene Nummulites\r\nand Cretaceous forms of smaller size,--are very frequently filled\r\nsolid with calcareous matter, and as Dr. Carpenter well remarks,\r\neven well preserved Tertiary Nummulites in this state often fail\r\ngreatly in showing their structures, though in the same condition\r\nthey occasionally show these in great perfection. Among the finest\r\nI have seen are specimens from the Mount of Olives (fig. 19), and\r\nDr. Carpenter mentions as equally good those of the London clay of\r\nBracklesham. But in no condition do modern Foraminifera or those of\r\nthe Tertiary and Mesozoic rocks appear in greater perfection than when\r\nfilled with the hydrous silicate of iron and potash called glauconite,\r\nand which gives by the abundance of its little bottle-green concretions\r\nthe name of \"green-sand\" to formations of this age both in Europe and\r\nAmerica. In some beds of green-sand every grain seems to have been\r\nmoulded into the interior of a microscopic shell, and has retained\r\nits form after the frail envelope has been removed. In some cases the\r\nglauconite has not only filled the chambers but has penetrated the\r\nfine tubulation, and when the shell is removed, either naturally or\r\nby the action of an acid, these project in minute needles or bundles\r\nof threads from the surface of the cast. It is in the warmer seas,\r\nand especially in the bed of the Ægean and of the Gulf Stream, that\r\nsuch specimens are now most usually found. If we ask why this mineral\r\nglauconite should be associated with Foraminiferal shells, the answer\r\nis that they are both products of one kind of locality. The same sea\r\nbottoms in which Foraminifera most abound are also those in which for\r\nsome unknown chemical reason glauconite is deposited. Hence no doubt\r\nthe association of this mineral with the great Foraminiferal formation\r\nof the chalk. It is indeed by no means unlikely that the selection\r\nby these creatures of the pure carbonate of lime from the sea-water\r\nor its minute plants, may be the means of setting free the silica,\r\niron, and potash, in a state suitable for their combination. Similar\r\nsilicates are found associated with marine limestones, as far back as\r\nthe Silurian age; and Dr. Sterry Hunt, than whom no one can be a better\r\nauthority on chemical geology, has argued on chemical grounds that the\r\noccurrence of serpentine with the remains of Eozoon is an association\r\nof the same character.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the infiltration of the pores of Eozoon with\r\nserpentine and other silicates has evidently been one main means of\r\nthe preservation of its structure. When so infiltrated no metamorphism\r\nshort of the complete fusion of the containing rock could obliterate\r\nthe minutest points of structure; and that such fusion has not\r\noccurred, the preservation in the Laurentian rocks of the most delicate\r\nlamination of the beds shows conclusively; while, as already stated, it\r\ncan be shown that the alteration which has occurred might have taken\r\nplace at a temperature far short of that necessary to fuse limestone.\r\nThus has it happened that these most ancient fossils have been\r\nhanded down to our time in a state of preservation comparable, as Dr.\r\nCarpenter states, to that of the best preserved fossil Foraminifera\r\nfrom the more recent formations that have come under his observation in\r\nthe course of all his long experience.\r\n\r\nLet us now look more minutely at the nature of the typical specimens\r\nof Eozoon as originally observed and described, and then turn to those\r\npreserved in other ways, or more or less destroyed and defaced. Taking\r\na polished specimen from Petite Nation, like that delineated in Plate\r\nV., we find the shell represented by white limestone, and the chambers\r\nby light green serpentine. By acting on the surface with a dilute\r\nacid we etch out the calcareous part, leaving a cast in serpentine\r\nof the cavities occupied by the soft parts; and when this is done in\r\npolished slices these may be made to print their own characters on\r\npaper, as has actually been done in the case of Plate V., which is an\r\nelectrotype taken from an actual specimen, and shows both the laminated\r\nand acervuline parts of the fossil. If the process of decalcification\r\nhas been carefully executed, we find in the excavated spaces delicate\r\nramifying processes of opaque serpentine or transparent dolomite, which\r\nwere originally imbedded in the calcareous substance, and which are\r\noften of extreme fineness and complexity. (Plate VI. and fig. 10.)\r\nThese are casts of the canals which traversed the shell when still\r\ninhabited by the animal. In some well preserved specimens we find the\r\noriginal cell-wall represented by a delicate white film, which under\r\nthe microscope shows minute needle-like parallel processes representing\r\nits still finer tubuli. It is evident that to have filled these tubuli\r\nthe serpentine must have been introduced in a state of actual solution,\r\nand must have carried with it no foreign impurities. Consequently we\r\nfind that in the chambers themselves the serpentine is pure; and if we\r\nexamine it under polarized light, we see that it presents a singularly\r\ncurdled or irregularly laminated appearance, which I have designated\r\nunder the name septariiform, as if it had an imperfectly crystalline\r\nstructure, and had been deposited in irregular laminæ, beginning at\r\nthe sides of the chambers, and filling them toward the middle, and\r\nhad afterward been cracked by shrinkage, and the cracks filled with a\r\nsecond deposit of serpentine. Now, serpentine is a hydrous silicate of\r\nmagnesia, and all that we need to suppose is that in the deposits of\r\nthe Laurentian sea magnesia was present instead of iron and potash,\r\nand we can understand that the Laurentian fossil has been petrified\r\nby infiltration with serpentine, as more modern Foraminifera have\r\nbeen with glauconite, which, though it usually has little magnesia,\r\noften has a considerable percentage of alumina. Further, in specimens\r\nof Eozoon from Burgess, the filling mineral is loganite, a compound\r\nof silica, alumina, magnesia and iron, with water, and in certain\r\nSilurian limestones from New Brunswick and Wales, in which the delicate\r\nmicroscopic pores of the skeletons of stalked star-fishes or Crinoids\r\nhave been filled with mineral deposits, so that when decalcified\r\nthese are most beautifully represented by their casts, Dr. Hunt has\r\nproved the filling mineral to be a silicate of alumina, iron, magnesia\r\nand potash, intermediate between serpentine and glauconite. We have,\r\ntherefore, ample warrant for adhering to Dr. Hunt's conclusion that\r\nthe Laurentian serpentine was deposited under conditions similar to\r\nthose of the modern green-sand. Indeed, independently of Eozoon, it is\r\nimpossible that any geologist who has studied the manner in which this\r\nmineral is associated with the Laurentian limestones could believe it\r\nto have been formed in any other way. Nor need we be astonished at\r\nthe fineness of the infiltration by which these minute tubes, perhaps\r\n1/10000 of an inch in diameter, are filled with mineral matter. The\r\nmicro-geologist well knows how, in more modern deposits, the finest\r\npores of fossils are filled, and that mineral matter in solution\r\ncan penetrate the smallest openings that the microscope can detect.\r\nWherever the fluids of the living body can penetrate, there also\r\nmineral substances can be carried, and this natural injection, effected\r\nunder great pressure and with the advantage of ample time, can surpass\r\nany of the feats of the anatomical manipulator. Fig. 25 represents\r\na microscopic joint of a Crinoid from the Upper Silurian of New\r\nBrunswick, injected with the hydrous silicate already referred to, and\r\nfig. 26 shows a microscopic chambered or spiral shell, from a Welsh\r\nSilurian limestone, with its cavities filled with a similar substance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. _Joint of a Crinoid, having its pores injected\r\nwith a Hydrous Silicate._\r\n\r\nUpper Silurian Limestone, Pole Hill, New Brunswick. Magnified 25\r\ndiameters.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. _Shell from a Silurian Limestone, Wales; its\r\ncavity filled with a Hydrous Silicate._\r\n\r\nMagnified 25 diameters.]\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to refer to the attempts which have been made to\r\nexplain by merely mineral deposits the occurrence of the serpentine\r\nin the canals and chambers of Eozoon, and its presenting the form it\r\ndoes, to see that this is the case. Prof. Rowney, for example, to avoid\r\nthe force of the argument from the canal system, is constrained to\r\nimagine that the whole mass has at one time been serpentine, and that\r\nthis has been partially washed away, and replaced by calcite. If so,\r\nwhence the deposition of the supposed mass of serpentine, which has to\r\nbe accounted for in this way as well as in the other? How did it happen\r\nto be eroded into so regular chambers, leaving intermediate floors and\r\npartitions. And, more wonderful still, how did the regular dendritic\r\nbundles, so delicate that they are removed by a breath, remain perfect,\r\nand endure until they were imbedded in calcareous spar? Further, how\r\ndoes it happen that in some specimens serpentine and pyroxene seem to\r\nhave encroached upon the structure, as if they and not calcite were the\r\neroding minerals? How any one who has looked at the structures can for\r\na moment imagine such a possibility, it is difficult to understand. If\r\nwe could suppose the serpentine to have been originally deposited as\r\na cellular or laminated mass, and its cavities filled with calcite in\r\na gelatinous or semi-fluid state, we might suppose the fine processes\r\nof serpentine to have grown outward into these cavities in the mass,\r\nas fibres of oxide of iron or manganese have grown in the silica of\r\nmoss-agate; but this theory would be encompassed with nearly as great\r\nmechanical and chemical difficulties. The only rational view that any\r\none can take of the process is, that the calcareous matter was the\r\noriginal substance, and that it had delicate tubes traversing it which\r\nbecame injected with serpentine. The same explanation, and no other,\r\nwill suffice for those delicate cell-walls, penetrated by innumerable\r\nthreads of serpentine, which must have been injected into pores. It is\r\ntrue that there are in some of the specimens cracks filled with fibrous\r\nserpentine or chrysotile, but these traverse the mass in irregular\r\ndirections, and they consist of closely packed angular prisms,\r\ninstead of a matrix of limestone penetrated by cylindrical threads of\r\nserpentine. (Fig. 27.) Here I must once for all protest against the\r\ntendency of some opponents of Eozoon to confound these structures and\r\nthe canal system of Eozoon with the acicular crystals, and dendritic\r\nor coralloidal forms, observed in some minerals. It is easy to make\r\nsuch comparisons appear plausible to the uninitiated, but practised\r\nobservers cannot be so deceived, the differences are too marked and\r\nessential. In illustration of this, I may refer to the highly magnified\r\ncanals in figs. 28 and 29. Further, it is evident from the examination\r\nof the specimens, that the chrysotile veins, penetrating as they often\r\ndo diagonally or transversely across both chambers and walls, must have\r\noriginated subsequently to the origin and hardening of the rock and its\r\nfossils, and result from aqueous deposition of fibrous serpentine in\r\ncracks which traverse alike the fossils and their matrix. In specimens\r\nnow before me, nothing can be more plain than this entire independence\r\nof the shining silky veins of fibrous serpentine, and the fact of their\r\nhaving been formed subsequently to the fossilization of the Eozoon;\r\nsince they can be seen to run across the lamination, and to branch off\r\nirregularly in lines altogether distinct from the structure. This,\r\nwhile it shows that these veins have no connection with the fossil,\r\nshows also that the latter was an original ingredient of the beds when\r\ndeposited, and not a product of subsequent concretionary action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. _Diagram showing the different appearances\r\nof the cell-wall of Eozoon and of a vein of Chrysotile, when highly\r\nmagnified._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. _Casts of Canals of Eozoon in Serpentine,\r\ndecalcified and highly magnified._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. _Canals of Eozoon._\r\n\r\nHighly magnified.]\r\n\r\nTaking the specimens preserved by serpentine as typical, we now turn\r\nto certain other and, in some respects, less characteristic specimens,\r\nwhich are nevertheless very instructive. At the Calumet some of\r\nthe masses are partly filled with serpentine and partly with white\r\npyroxene, an anhydrous silicate of lime and magnesia. The two minerals\r\ncan readily be distinguished when viewed with polarized light; and in\r\nsome slices I have seen part of a chamber or group of canals filled\r\nwith serpentine and part with pyroxene. In this case the pyroxene\r\nor the materials which now compose it, must have been introduced by\r\ninfiltration, as well as the serpentine. This is the more remarkable as\r\npyroxene is most usually found as an ingredient of igneous rocks; but\r\nDr. Hunt has shown that in the Laurentian limestones and also in veins\r\ntraversing them, it occurs under conditions which imply its deposition\r\nfrom water, either cold or warm. Gümbel remarks on this:--\"Hunt, in\r\na very ingenious manner, compares this formation and deposition of\r\nserpentine, pyroxene, and loganite, with that of glauconite, whose\r\nformation has gone on uninterruptedly from the Silurian to the Tertiary\r\nperiod, and is even now taking place in the depths of the sea; it being\r\nwell known that Ehrenberg and others have already shown that many of\r\nthe grains of glauconite are casts of the interior of foraminiferal\r\nshells. In the light of this comparison, the notion that the serpentine\r\nand such like minerals of the primitive limestones have been formed,\r\nin a similar manner, in the chambers of Eozoic Foraminifera, loses any\r\ntraces of improbability which it might at first seem to possess.\"\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the skeleton of Eozoon, and even in the best\r\ninfiltrated serpentine specimens, there are portions of the cell-wall\r\nand canal system which have been filled with calcareous spar or with\r\ndolomite, so similar to the skeleton that it can be detected only under\r\nthe most favourable lights and with great care. (Fig. 24, _supra_.)\r\nThe same phenomena may be observed in joints of Crinoids from the\r\nPalæozoic rocks, and they constitute proofs of organic origin even\r\nmore irrefragable than the filling with serpentine. Dr. Carpenter has\r\nrecently, in replying to the objections of Mr. Carter, made excellent\r\nuse of this feature of the preservation of Eozoon. It is further to\r\nbe remarked that in all the specimens of true Eozoon, as well as\r\nin many other calcareous fossils preserved in ancient rocks, the\r\ncalcareous matter, even when its minute structures are not preserved\r\nor are obscured, presents a minutely granular or curdled appearance,\r\narising no doubt from the original presence of organic matter, and not\r\nrecognised in purely inorganic calcite.\r\n\r\nAnother style of these remarkable fossils is that of the Burgess\r\nspecimens. In these the walls have been changed into dolomite\r\nor magnesian limestone, and the canals seem to have been wholly\r\nobliterated, so that only the laminated structure remains. The material\r\nfilling the chambers is also an aluminous silicate named loganite; and\r\nthis seems to have been introduced, not so much in solution, as in\r\nthe state of muddy slime, since it contains foreign bodies, as grains\r\nof sand and little groups of silicious concretions, some of which are\r\nnot unlikely casts of the interior of minute foraminiferal shells\r\ncontemporary with Eozoon, and will be noticed in the sequel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. _Eozoon from Tudor._\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds natural size. (_a._) Tubuli. (_b._) Canals. Magnified. _a_\r\nand _b_ from another specimen.]\r\n\r\nStill another mode of occurrence is presented by a remarkable specimen\r\nfrom Tudor in Ontario, and from beds probably on the horizon of the\r\nUpper Laurentian or Huronian.[Y] It occurs in a rock scarcely at all\r\nmetamorphic, and the fossil is represented by white carbonate of lime,\r\nwhile the containing matrix is a dark-coloured coarse limestone. In\r\nthis specimen the material filling the chambers has not penetrated\r\nthe canals except in a few places, where they appear filled with dark\r\ncarbonaceous matter. In mode of preservation these Tudor specimens\r\nmuch resemble the ordinary fossils of the Silurian rocks. One of\r\nthe specimens in the collection of the Geological Survey (fig. 30)\r\npresents a clavate form, as if it had been a detached individual\r\nsupported on one end at the bottom of the sea. It shows, as does\r\nalso the original Calumet specimen, the septa approaching each other\r\nand coalescing at the margin of the form, where there were probably\r\norifices communicating with the exterior. Other specimens of fragmental\r\nEozoon from the Petite Nation localities have their canals filled with\r\ndolomite, which probably penetrated them after they were broken up\r\nand imbedded in the rock. I have ascertained with respect to these\r\nfragments of Eozoon, that they occur abundantly in certain layers of\r\nthe Laurentian limestone, beds of some thickness being in great part\r\nmade up of them, and coarse and fine fragments occur in alternate\r\nlayers, like the broken corals in some Silurian limestones.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Y: See Note B, Chap. III.]\r\n\r\nFinally, on this part of the subject, careful observation of many\r\nspecimens of Laurentian limestone which present no trace of Eozoon\r\nwhen viewed by the naked eye, and no evidence of structure when acted\r\non with acids, are nevertheless organic, and consist of fragments\r\nof Eozoon, and possibly of other organisms, not infiltrated with\r\nsilicates, but only with carbonate of lime, and consequently revealing\r\nonly obscure indications of their minute structure. I have satisfied\r\nmyself of this by long and patient investigations, which scarcely admit\r\nof any adequate representation, either by words or figures.\r\n\r\nEvery worker in those applications of the microscope to geological\r\nspecimens which have been termed micro-geology, is familiar with the\r\nfact that crystalline forces and mechanical movements of material\r\noften play the most fantastic tricks with fossilized organic matter.\r\nIn fossil woods, for example, we often have the tissues disorganized,\r\nwith radiating crystallizations of calcite and little spherical\r\nconcretions of quartz, or disseminated cubes and grains of pyrite,\r\nor little veins filled with sulphate of barium or other minerals. We\r\nneed not, therefore, be surprised to find that in the venerable rocks\r\ncontaining Eozoon, such things occur in the more highly crystalline\r\nparts of the limestones, and even in some still showing traces of\r\nthe fossil. We find many disseminated crystals of magnetite, pyrite,\r\nspinel, mica, and other minerals, curiously curved prisms of vermicular\r\nmica, bundles of aciculi of tremolite and similar substances, veins of\r\ncalcite and crysolite or fibrous serpentine, which often traverse the\r\nbest specimens. Where these occur abundantly we usually find no organic\r\nstructures remaining, or if they exist they are in a very defective\r\nstate of preservation. Even in specimens presenting the lamination of\r\nEozoon to the naked eye, these crystalline actions have often destroyed\r\nthe minute structure; and I fear that some microscopists have been\r\nvictimised by having under their consideration only specimens in which\r\nthe actual characters had been too much defaced to be discernible. I\r\nmust here state that I have found some of the specimens sold under\r\nthe name of Eozoon Canadense by dealers in microscopical objects to\r\nbe almost or quite worthless, being destitute of any good structure,\r\nand often merely pieces of Laurentian limestone with serpentine\r\ngrains only. I fear that the circulation of such specimens has done\r\nmuch to cause scepticism as to the Foraminiferal nature of Eozoon. No\r\nmistake can be greater than to suppose that any and every specimen\r\nof Laurentian limestone must contain Eozoon. More especially have\r\nI hitherto failed to detect traces of it in those carbonaceous or\r\ngraphitic limestones which are so very abundant in the Laurentian\r\ncountry. Perhaps where vegetable matter was very abundant Eozoon\r\ndid not thrive, or on the other hand the growth of Eozoon may have\r\ndiminished the quantity of vegetable matter. It is also to be observed\r\nthat much compression and distortion have occurred in the beds of\r\nLaurentian limestone and their contained fossils, and also that the\r\nspecimens are often broken by faults, some of which are so small as to\r\nappear only on microscopic examination, and to shift the plates of the\r\nfossil just as if they were beds of rock. This, though it sometimes\r\nproduces puzzling appearances, is an evidence that the fossils were\r\nhard and brittle when this faulting took place, and is consequently\r\nan additional proof of their extraneous origin. In some specimens it\r\nwould seem that the lower and older part of the fossil had been wholly\r\nconverted into serpentine or pyroxene, or had so nearly experienced\r\nthis change that only small parts of the calcareous wall can be\r\nrecognised. These portions correspond with fossil woods altogether\r\nsilicified, not only by the filling of the cells, but also by the\r\nconversion of the walls into silica. I have specimens which manifestly\r\nshow the transition from the ordinary condition of filling with\r\nserpentine to one in which the cell-walls are represented obscurely by\r\none shade of this mineral and the cavities by another.\r\n\r\nThe above considerations as to mode of preservation of Eozoon concur\r\nwith those in previous chapters in showing its oceanic character;\r\nbut the ocean of the Eozoic period may not have been so deep as at\r\npresent, and its waters were probably warm and well stocked with\r\nmineral matters derived from the newly formed land, or from hot springs\r\nin its own bottom. On this point the interesting investigations of\r\nDr. Hunt with reference to the chemical conditions of the Silurian\r\nseas, allow us to suppose that the Laurentian ocean may have been much\r\nmore richly stored, more especially with salts of lime and magnesia,\r\nthan that of subsequent times. Hence the conditions of warmth, light,\r\nand nutriment, required by such gigantic Protozoans would all be\r\npresent, and hence, also no doubt, some of the peculiarities of its\r\nmineralization.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A.) Dr. Sterry Hunt on the Mineralogy of Eozoon and the containing\r\nRocks.\r\n\r\n  It was fortunate for the recognition of Eozoon that Dr. Hunt had,\r\n  before its discovery, made so thorough researches into the chemistry\r\n  of the Laurentian series, and was prepared to show the chemical\r\n  possibilities of the preservation of fossils in these ancient\r\n  deposits. The following able summary of his views was appended to the\r\n  original description of the fossil in the _Journal of the Geological\r\n  Society_.\r\n\r\n  \"The details of structure have been preserved by the introduction\r\n  of certain mineral silicates, which have not only filled up the\r\n  chambers, cells, and canals left vacant by the disappearance of the\r\n  animal matter, but have in very many cases been injected into the\r\n  tubuli, filling even their smallest ramifications. These silicates\r\n  have thus taken the place of the original sarcode, while the\r\n  calcareous septa remain. It will then be understood that when the\r\n  replacement of the Eozoon by silicates is spoken of, this is to be\r\n  understood of the soft parts only; since the calcareous skeleton is\r\n  preserved, in most cases, without any alteration. The vacant spaces\r\n  left by the decay of the sarcode may be supposed to have been filled\r\n  by a process of infiltration, in which the silicates were deposited\r\n  from solution in water, like the silica which fills up the pores of\r\n  wood in the process of silicification. The replacing silicates, so\r\n  far as yet observed, are a white pyroxene, a pale green serpentine,\r\n  and a dark green alumino-magnesian mineral, which is allied in\r\n  composition to chlorite and to pyrosclerite, and which I have\r\n  referred to loganite. The calcareous septa in the last case are found\r\n  to be dolomitic, but in the other instances are nearly pure carbonate\r\n  of lime. The relations of the carbonate and the silicates are well\r\n  seen in thin sections under the microscope, especially by polarized\r\n  light. The calcite, dolomite, and pyroxene exhibit their crystalline\r\n  structure to the unaided eye; and the serpentine and loganite are\r\n  also seen to be crystalline when examined with the microscope. When\r\n  portions of the fossil are submitted to the action of an acid, the\r\n  carbonate of lime is dissolved, and a coherent mass of serpentine is\r\n  obtained, which is a perfect cast of the soft parts of the Eozoon.\r\n  The form of the sarcode which filled the chambers and cells is\r\n  beautifully shown, as well as the connecting canals and the groups\r\n  of tubuli; these latter are seen in great perfection upon surfaces\r\n  from which the carbonate of lime has been partially dissolved. Their\r\n  preservation is generally most complete when the replacing mineral is\r\n  serpentine, although very perfect specimens are sometimes found in\r\n  pyroxene. The crystallization of the latter mineral appears, however,\r\n  in most cases to have disturbed the calcareous septa.\r\n\r\n  \"Serpentine and pyroxene are generally associated in these specimens,\r\n  as if their disposition had marked different stages of a continuous\r\n  process. At the Calumet, one specimen of the fossil exhibits the\r\n  whole of the sarcode replaced by serpentine; while, in another one\r\n  from the same locality, a layer of pale green translucent serpentine\r\n  occurs in immediate contact with the white pyroxene. The calcareous\r\n  septa in this specimen are very thin, and are transverse to the plane\r\n  of contact of the two minerals; yet they are seen to traverse both\r\n  the pyroxene and the serpentine without any interruption or change.\r\n  Some sections exhibit these two minerals filling adjacent cells,\r\n  or even portions of the same cell, a clear line of division being\r\n  visible between them. In the specimens from Grenville on the other\r\n  hand, it would seem as if the development of the Eozoon (considerable\r\n  masses of which were replaced by pyroxene) had been interrupted, and\r\n  that a second growth of the animal, which was replaced by serpentine,\r\n  had taken place upon the older masses, filling up their interstices.\"\r\n\r\n  [Details of chemical composition are then given.]\r\n\r\n  \"When examined under the microscope, the loganite which replaces the\r\n  Eozoon of Burgess shows traces of cleavage-lines, which indicate a\r\n  crystalline structure. The grains of insoluble matter found in the\r\n  analysis, chiefly of quartz-sand, are distinctly seen as foreign\r\n  bodies imbedded in the mass, which is moreover marked by lines\r\n  apparently due to cracks formed by a shrinking of the silicate, and\r\n  subsequently filled by a further infiltration of the same material.\r\n  This arrangement resembles on a minute scale that of septaria.\r\n  Similar appearances are also observed in the serpentine which\r\n  replaces the Eozoon of Grenville, and also in a massive serpentine\r\n  from Burgess, resembling this, and enclosing fragments of the fossil.\r\n  In both of these specimens also grains of mechanical impurities are\r\n  detected by the microscope; they are however, rarer than in the\r\n  loganite of Burgess.\r\n\r\n  \"From the above facts it may be concluded that the various silicates\r\n  which now constitute pyroxene, serpentine, and loganite were directly\r\n  deposited in waters in the midst of which the Eozoon was still\r\n  growing, or had only recently perished; and that these silicates\r\n  penetrated, enclosed, and preserved the calcareous structure\r\n  precisely as carbonate of lime might have done. The association\r\n  of the silicates with the Eozoon is only accidental; and large\r\n  quantities of them, deposited at the same time, include no organic\r\n  remains. Thus, for example, there are found associated with the\r\n  Eozoon limestones of Grenville, massive layers and concretions of\r\n  pure serpentine; and a serpentine from Burgess has already been\r\n  mentioned as containing only small broken fragments of the fossil.\r\n  In like manner large masses of white pyroxene, often surrounded\r\n  by serpentine, both of which are destitute of traces of organic\r\n  structure, are found in the limestone at the Calumet. In some cases,\r\n  however, the crystallization of the pyroxene has given rise to\r\n  considerable cleavage-planes, and has thus obliterated the organic\r\n  structures from masses which, judging from portions visible here and\r\n  there, appear to have been at one time penetrated by the calcareous\r\n  plates of Eozoon. Small irregular veins of crystalline calcite, and\r\n  of serpentine, are found to traverse such pyroxene masses in the\r\n  Eozoon limestone of Grenville.\r\n\r\n  \"It appears that great beds of the Laurentian limestones are\r\n  composed of the ruins of the Eozoon. These rocks, which are white,\r\n  crystalline, and mingled with pale green serpentine, are similar in\r\n  aspect to many of the so-called primary limestones of other regions.\r\n  In most cases the limestones are non-magnesian, but one of them\r\n  from Grenville was found to be dolomitic. The accompanying strata\r\n  often present finely crystallized pyroxene, hornblende, phlogopite,\r\n  apatite, and other minerals. These observations bring the formation\r\n  of silicious minerals face to face with life, and show that their\r\n  generation was not incompatible with the contemporaneous existence\r\n  and the preservation of organic forms. They confirm, moreover, the\r\n  view which I some years since put forward, that these silicated\r\n  minerals have been formed, not by subsequent metamorphism in\r\n  deeply buried sediments, but by reactions going on at the earth's\r\n  surface.[Z] In support of this view, I have elsewhere referred to\r\n  the deposition of silicates of lime, magnesia, and iron from natural\r\n  waters, to the great beds of sepiolite in the unaltered Tertiary\r\n  strata of Europe; to the contemporaneous formation of neolite (an\r\n  aluimino-magnesian silicate related to loganite and chlorite in\r\n  composition); and to glauconite, which occurs not only in Secondary,\r\n  Tertiary, and Recent deposits, but also, as I have shown, in Lower\r\n  Silurian strata.[AA] This hydrous silicate of protoxide of iron\r\n  and potash, which sometimes includes a considerable proportion of\r\n  alumina in its composition, has been observed by Ehrenberg, Mantell,\r\n  and Bailey, associated with organic forms in a manner which seems\r\n  identical with that in which pyroxene, serpentine, and loganite\r\n  occur with the Eozoon in the Laurentian limestones. According to the\r\n  first of these observers, the grains of green-sand, or glauconite,\r\n  from the Tertiary limestone of Alabama, are casts of the interior\r\n  of Polythalamia, the glauconite having filled them by 'a species of\r\n  natural injection, which is often so perfect that not only the large\r\n  and coarse cells, but also the very finest canals of the cell-walls\r\n  and all their connecting tubes, are thus petrified and separately\r\n  exhibited.' Bailey confirmed these observations, and extended them.\r\n  He found in various Cretaceous and Tertiary limestones of the United\r\n  States, casts in glauconite, not only of _Foraminifera_, but of\r\n  spines of _Echinus_, and of the cavities of corals. Besides, there\r\n  were numerous red, green, and white casts of minute anastomosing\r\n  tubuli, which, according to Bailey, resemble the casts of the holes\r\n  made by burrowing sponges (_Cliona_) and worms. These forms are seen\r\n  after the dissolving of the carbonate of lime by a dilute acid.\r\n  He found, moreover, similar casts of _Foraminifera_, of minute\r\n  mollusks, and of branching tubuli, in mud obtained from soundings in\r\n  the Gulf Stream, and concluded that the deposition of glauconite is\r\n  still going on in the depths of the sea.[AB] Pourtales has followed\r\n  up these investigations on the recent formation of glauconite in\r\n  the Gulf Stream waters. He has observed its deposition also in\r\n  the cavities of _Millepores_, and in the canals in the shells\r\n  of _Balanus_. According to him, the glauconite grains formed in\r\n  _Foraminifera_ lose after a time their calcareous envelopes, and\r\n  finally become 'conglomerated into small black pebbles,' sections\r\n  of which still show under a microscope the characteristic spiral\r\n  arrangement of the cells.[AC]\r\n\r\n[Footnote Z: _Silliman's Journal_ [2], xxix., p. 284; xxxii., p. 286.\r\n_Geology of Canada_, p. 577.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AA: _Silliman's Journal_ [2], xxxiii., p. 277. _Geology of\r\nCanada_, p. 487.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AB: _Silliman's Journal_ [2], xxii., p. 280.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AC: _Report of United States Coast-Survey_, 1858, p. 248.]\r\n\r\n  \"It appears probable from these observations that glauconite is\r\n  formed by chemical reactions in the ooze at the bottom of the sea,\r\n  where dissolved silica comes in contact with iron oxide rendered\r\n  soluble by organic matter; the resulting silicate deposits itself in\r\n  the cavities of shells and other vacant spaces. A process analogous\r\n  to this in its results, has filled the chambers and canals of the\r\n  Laurentian _Foraminifera_ with other silicates; from the comparative\r\n  rarity of mechanical impurities in these silicates, however, it would\r\n  appear that they were deposited in clear water. Alumina and oxide of\r\n  iron enter into the composition of loganite as well as of glauconite;\r\n  but in the other replacing minerals, pyroxene and serpentine, we\r\n  have only silicates of lime and magnesia, which were probably formed\r\n  by the direct action of alkaline silicates, either dissolved in\r\n  surface-waters, or in those of submarine springs, upon the calcareous\r\n  and magnesian salts of the sea-water.\"\r\n\r\n  [As stated in the text, the canals of Eozoon are sometimes filled\r\n  with dolomite, or in part with serpentine and in part with dolomite.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(B.) Silurian Limestones holding Fossils infiltrated with Hydrous\r\nSilicate.\r\n\r\n  Since my attention has been directed to this subject, many\r\n  illustrations have come under my notice of Silurian limestones in\r\n  which the pores of fossils are infiltrated with hydrous silicates\r\n  akin to glauconite and serpentine. A limestone of this kind,\r\n  collected by Mr. Robb, at Pole Hill, in New Brunswick, afforded not\r\n  only beautiful specimens of portions of Crinoids preserved in this\r\n  way, but a sufficient quantity of the material was collected for an\r\n  exact analysis, a note on which was published in the Proceedings of\r\n  the Royal Irish Academy, 1871.\r\n\r\n  The limestone of Pole Hill is composed almost wholly of organic\r\n  fragments, cemented by crystalline carbonate of lime, and traversed\r\n  by slender veins of the same mineral. Among the fragments may be\r\n  recognised under the microscope portions of Trilobites, and of\r\n  brachiopod and gastropod shells, and numerous joints and plates\r\n  of Crinoids. The latter are remarkable for the manner in which\r\n  their reticulated structure, which is similar to that of modern\r\n  Crinoids, has been injected with a silicious substance, which is\r\n  seen distinctly in slices, and still more plainly in decalcified\r\n  specimens. This filling is precisely similar in appearance to the\r\n  serpentine filling the canals of Eozoon, the only apparent difference\r\n  being in the forms of the cells and tubes of the Crinoids, as\r\n  compared with those of the Laurentian fossil; the same silicious\r\n  substance also occupies the cavities of some of the small shells,\r\n  and occurs in mere amorphous pieces, apparently filling interstices.\r\n  From its mode of occurrence, I have not the slightest doubt that\r\n  it occupied the cavities of the crinoidal fragments while still\r\n  recent, and before they had been cemented together by the calcareous\r\n  paste. This silicious filling is therefore similar on the one hand\r\n  to that effected by the ancient serpentine of the Laurentian, and\r\n  on the other to that which results from the depositions of modern\r\n  glauconite. The analysis of Dr. Hunt, which I give below, fully\r\n  confirms these analogies.\r\n\r\n  I may add that I have examined under the microscope portions of the\r\n  substance prepared by Dr. Hunt for analysis, and find it to retain\r\n  its form, showing that it is the actual filling of the cavities. I\r\n  have also examined the small amount of insoluble silica remaining\r\n  after his treatment with acid and alkaline solvents, and find it to\r\n  consist of angular and rounded grains of quartzose sand.\r\n\r\n  The following are Dr. Hunt's notes:--\r\n\r\n  \"The fossiliferous limestone from Pole Hill, New Brunswick, probably\r\n  of Upper Silurian age, is light gray and coarsely granular. When\r\n  treated with dilute hydrochloric acid, it leaves a residue of 5·9 per\r\n  cent., and the solution gives 1·8 per cent. of alumina and oxide of\r\n  iron, and magnesia equal to 1·35 of carbonate--the remainder being\r\n  carbonate of lime. The insoluble matter separated by dilute acid,\r\n  after washing by decantation from a small amount of fine flocculent\r\n  matter, consists, apart from an admixture of quartz grains, entirely\r\n  of casts and moulded forms of a peculiar silicate, which Dr. Dawson\r\n  has observed in decalcified specimens filling the pores of crinoidal\r\n  stems; and which when separated by an acid, resembles closely under\r\n  the microscope the coralloidal forms of arragonite known as _flos\r\n  ferri_, the surfaces being somewhat rugose and glistening with\r\n  crystalline faces. This silicate is sub-translucent, and of a pale\r\n  green colour, but immediately becomes of a light reddish brown when\r\n  heated to redness in the air, and gives off water when heated in a\r\n  tube, without however, changing its form. It is partially decomposed\r\n  by strong hydrochloric acid, yielding a considerable amount of\r\n  protosalt of iron. Strong hot sulphuric acid readily and completely\r\n  decomposes it, showing it to be a silicate of alumina and ferrous\r\n  oxide, with some magnesia and alkalies, but with no trace of lime.\r\n  The separated silica, which remains after the action of the acid,\r\n  is readily dissolved by a dilute solution of soda, leaving behind\r\n  nothing but angular and partially rounded grains of sand, chiefly\r\n  of colourless vitreous quartz. An analysis effected in the way just\r\n  described on 1·187 grammes gave the following results, which give, by\r\n  calculation, the centesimal composition of the mineral:--\r\n\r\n  Silica                  ·3290       38·93   = 20·77 oxygen·\r\n  Alumina                 ·2440       28·88   = 13·46    \"\r\n  Protoxyd of iron        ·1593       18·86}\r\n  Magnesia                ·0360        4·25}  =  6·29    \"\r\n  Potash                  ·0140        1·69}\r\n  Soda                    ·0042         ·48}\r\n  Water                   ·0584        6·91   =  6·14    \"\r\n  Insoluble, quartz       ·3420\r\n                         ------      ------\r\n                         1·1869      100·00\r\n\r\n  \"A previous analysis of a portion of the mixture by fusion with\r\n  carbonate of soda gave, by calculation, 18·80 p. c. of protoxide of\r\n  iron, and amounts of alumina and combined silica closely agreeing\r\n  with those just given.\r\n\r\n  \"The oxygen ratios, as above calculated, are nearly as 3 : 2 : 1 : 1.\r\n  This mineral approaches in composition to the jollyte of Von Kobell,\r\n  from which it differs in containing a portion of alkalies, and only\r\n  one half as much water. In these respects it agrees nearly with the\r\n  silicate found by Robert Hoffman, at Raspenau, in Bohemia, where it\r\n  occurs in thin layers alternating with picrosmine, and surrounding\r\n  masses of Eozoon in the Laurentian limestones of that region;[AD]\r\n  the Eozoon itself being there injected with a hydrous silicate which\r\n  may be described as intermediate between glauconite and chlorite in\r\n  composition. The mineral first mentioned is compared by Hoffman to\r\n  fahlunite, to which jollyte is also related in physical characters as\r\n  well as in composition. Under the names of fahlunite, gigantolite,\r\n  pinite, etc., are included a great class of hydrous silicates, which\r\n  from their imperfectly crystalline condition, have generally been\r\n  regarded, like serpentine, as results of the alteration of other\r\n  silicates. It is, however, difficult to admit that the silicate\r\n  found in the condition described by Hoffman, and still more the\r\n  present mineral, which injects the pores of palæozoic Crinoids, can\r\n  be any other than an original deposition, allied in the mode of its\r\n  formation, to the serpentine, pyroxene, and other minerals which have\r\n  injected the Laurentian Eozoon, and the serpentine and glauconite,\r\n  which in a similar manner fill Tertiary and recent shells.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote AD: _Journ. für Prakt.

Various Minerals filling Cavities of Fossils in the Laurentian.\r\n\r\n  The following on this subject is from a memoir by Dr. Hunt in the\r\n  _Twenty-first Report of the Regents of the University of New York_,\r\n  1874:--\r\n\r\n  \"Recent investigations have shown that in some cases the\r\n  dissemination of certain of these minerals through the crystalline\r\n  limestones is connected with organic forms. The observations\r\n  of Dr. Dawson and myself on the Eozoon Canadense showed that\r\n  certain silicates, namely serpentine, pyroxene, and loganite,\r\n  had been deposited in the cells and chambers left vacant by the\r\n  disappearance of the animal matter from the calcareous skeleton of\r\n  the foraminiferous organism; so that when this calcareous portion is\r\n  removed by an acid there remains a coherent mass, which is a cast of\r\n  the soft parts of the animal, in which, not only the chambers and\r\n  connecting canals, but the minute tubuli and pores are represented\r\n  by solid mineral silicates. It was shown that this process must have\r\n  taken place immediately after the death of the animal, and must have\r\n  depended on the deposition of these silicates from the waters of the\r\n  ocean.\r\n\r\n  \"The train of investigation thus opened up, has been pursued by\r\n  Dr. Gümbel, Director of the Geological Survey of Bavaria, who, in\r\n  a recent remarkable memoir presented to the Royal Society of that\r\n  country, has detailed his results.\r\n\r\n  \"Having first detected a fossil identical with the Canadian Eozoon\r\n  (together with several other curious microscopic organic forms not\r\n  yet observed in Canada), replaced by serpentine in a crystalline\r\n  limestone from the primitive group of Bavaria, which he identified\r\n  with the Laurentian system of this country, he next discovered a\r\n  related organism, to which he has given the name of Eozoon Bavaricum.\r\n  This occurs in a crystalline limestone belonging to a series of rocks\r\n  more recent than the Laurentian, but older than the Primordial zone\r\n  of the Lower Silurian, and designated by him the Hercynian clay slate\r\n  series, which he conceives may represent the Cambrian system of Great\r\n  Britain, and perhaps correspond to the Huronian series of Canada and\r\n  the United States. The cast of the soft parts of this new fossil is,\r\n  according to Gümbel, in part of serpentine, and in part of hornblende.\r\n\r\n  \"His attention was next directed to the green hornblende (pargasite)\r\n  which occurs in the crystalline limestone of Pargas in Finland, and\r\n  remains when the carbonate of lime is dissolved as a coherent mass\r\n  closely resembling that left by the irregular and acervuline forms\r\n  of Eozoon. The calcite walls also sometimes show casts of tubuli....\r\n  A white mineral, probably scapolite was found to constitute some\r\n  tubercles associated with the pargasite, and the two mineral species\r\n  were in some cases united in the same rounded grain.\r\n\r\n  \"Similar observations were made by him upon specimens of coccolite\r\n  or green pyroxene, occurring in rounded and wrinkled grains in a\r\n  Laurentian limestone from New York. These, according to Gümbel,\r\n  present the same connecting cylinders and branching stems as the\r\n  pargasite, and are by him supposed to have been moulded in the\r\n  same manner.... Very beautiful evidences of the same organic\r\n  structure consisting of the casts of tubuli and their ramifications,\r\n  were also observed by Gümbel in a purely crystalline limestone,\r\n  enclosing granules of chondrodite, hornblende, and garnet, from\r\n  Boden in Saxony. Other specimens of limestone, both with and without\r\n  serpentine and chondrodite, were examined without exhibiting any\r\n  traces of these peculiar forms; and these negative results are\r\n  justly deemed by Gümbel as going to prove that the structure of\r\n  the others is really, like that of Eozoon, the result of the\r\n  intervention of organic forms. Besides the minerals observed in the\r\n  replacing substance of Eozoon in Canada, viz., serpentine, pyroxene,\r\n  and loganite, Gümbel adds chondrodite, hornblende, scapolite, and\r\n  probably also pyrallolite, quartz, iolite, and dichroite.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(D.) Glauconites.\r\n\r\n  The following is from a paper by Dr. Hunt in the _Report of the\r\n  Survey of Canada_ for 1866:--\r\n\r\n  \"In connection with the Eozoon it is interesting to examine more\r\n  carefully into the nature of the matters which have been called\r\n  glauconite or green-sand. These names have been given to substances\r\n  of unlike composition, which, however, occur under similar\r\n  conditions, and appear to be chemical deposits from water, filling\r\n  cavities in minute fossils, or forming grains in sedimentary rocks\r\n  of various ages. Although greenish in colour, and soft and earthy\r\n  in texture, it will be seen that the various glauconites differ\r\n  widely in composition. The variety best known, and commonly regarded\r\n  as the type of the glauconites, is that found in the green-sand of\r\n  Cretaceous age in New Jersey, and in the Tertiary of Alabama; the\r\n  glauconite from the Lower Silurian rocks of the Upper Mississippi is\r\n  identical with it in composition. Analysis shows these glauconites to\r\n  be essentially hydrous silicates of protoxyd of iron, with more or\r\n  less alumina, and small but variable quantities of magnesia, besides\r\n  a notable amount of potash. This alkali is, however, sometimes\r\n  wanting, as appears from the analysis of a green-sand from Kent in\r\n  England, by that careful chemist, the late Dr. Edward Turner, and\r\n  in another examined by Berthier, from the _calcaire grossier_, near\r\n  Paris, which is essentially a serpentine in composition, being a\r\n  hydrous silicate of magnesia and protoxyd of iron. A comparison of\r\n  these last two will show that the loganite, which fills the ancient\r\n  Foraminifer of Burgess, is a silicate nearly related in composition.\r\n\r\n  I.

Here I think\r\nit necessary to explain that in suggesting the name Eozoon for the\r\nearliest fossil, and Eozoic for the formation in which it is contained,\r\nI had no intention to affirm that there may not have been precursors\r\nof the Dawn-animal. By the similar term, Eocene, Lyell did not mean\r\nto affirm that there may not have been modern types in the preceding\r\ngeological periods: and so the dawn of animal life may have had its\r\ngray or rosy breaking at a time long anterior to that in which Eozoon\r\nbuilt its marble reefs. When the fossils of this early auroral time\r\nshall be found, it will not be hard to invent appropriate names for\r\nthem. There are, however, two reasons that give propriety to the\r\nname in the present state of our knowledge. One is, that the Lower\r\nLaurentian rocks are absolutely the oldest that have yet come under\r\nthe notice of geologists, and at the present moment it seems extremely\r\nimprobable that any older sediments exist, at least in a condition to\r\nbe recognised as such. The other is that Eozoon, as a member of the\r\ngroup Protozoa, of gigantic size and comprehensive type, and oceanic in\r\nits habitat, is as likely as any other creature that can be imagined\r\nto have been the first representative of animal life on our planet.\r\nVegetable life may have preceded it, nay probably did so by at least\r\none great creative æon, and may have accumulated previous stores of\r\norganic matter; but if any older forms of animal life existed, it is\r\ncertain at least that they cannot have belonged to much simpler or more\r\ncomprehensive types. It is also to be observed that such forms of life,\r\nif they did exist, may have been naked protozoa, which may have left no\r\nsign of their existence except a minute trace of carbonaceous matter,\r\nand perhaps not even this.\r\n\r\nBut if we do not know, and perhaps we are not likely to know, any\r\nanimals older than Eozoon, may we not find traces of some of its\r\ncontemporaries, either in the Eozoon limestones themselves, or other\r\nrocks associated with them? Here we must admit that a deep sea\r\nForaminiferal limestone may give a very imperfect indication of the\r\nfauna of its time. A dredger who should have no other information as\r\nto the existing population of the world, except what he could gather\r\nfrom the deposits formed under several hundred fathoms of water, would\r\nnecessarily have very inadequate conceptions of the matter. In like\r\nmanner a geologist who should have no other information as to the\r\nanimal life of the Mesozoic ages than that furnished by some of the\r\nthick beds of white chalk might imagine that he had reached a period\r\nwhen the simplest kinds of protozoa predominated over all other\r\nforms of life; but this impression would at once be corrected by the\r\nexamination of other deposits of the same age: so our inferences as to\r\nthe life of the Laurentian from the contents of its oceanic limestones\r\nmay be very imperfect, and it may yet yield other and various fossils.\r\nIts possibilities are, however, limited by the fact that before we\r\nreach this great depth in the earth's crust, we have already left\r\nbehind in much newer formations all traces of animal life except a\r\nfew of the lower forms of aquatic invertebrates; so that we are not\r\nsurprised to find only a limited number of living things, and those of\r\nvery low type. Do we then know in the Laurentian even a few distinct\r\nspecies, or is our view limited altogether to Eozoon Canadense? In\r\nanswering this question we must bear in mind that the Laurentian itself\r\nwas of vast duration, and that important changes of life may have taken\r\nplace even between the deposition of the Eozoon limestones and that\r\nof those rocks in which we find the comparatively rich fauna of the\r\nPrimordial age. This subject was discussed by the writer as early as\r\n1865, and I may repeat here what could be said in relation to it at\r\nthat time:--\r\n\r\n\"In connection with these remarkable remains, it appeared desirable to\r\nascertain, if possible, what share these or other organic structures\r\nmay have had in the accumulation of the limestones of the Laurentian\r\nseries. Specimens were therefore selected by Sir W. E. Logan, and\r\nslices were prepared under his direction. On microscopic examination,\r\na number of these were found to exhibit merely a granular aggregation\r\nof crystals, occasionally with particles of graphite and other foreign\r\nminerals, or a laminated mixture of calcareous and other matters, in\r\nthe manner of some more modern sedimentary limestones. Others, however,\r\nwere evidently made up almost entirely of fragments of Eozoon, or of\r\nmixtures of these with other calcareous and carbonaceous fragments\r\nwhich afford more or less evidence of organic origin. The contents of\r\nthese organic limestones may be considered under the following heads:--\r\n\r\n1. Remains of Eozoon.\r\n\r\n2. Other calcareous bodies, probably organic.\r\n\r\n3. Objects imbedded in the serpentine.\r\n\r\n4. Carbonaceous matters.\r\n\r\n5. Perforations, or worm-burrows.\r\n\r\n\"1. The more perfect specimens of Eozoon do not constitute the mass\r\nof any of the larger specimens in the collection of the Survey; but\r\nconsiderable portions of some of them are made up of material of\r\nsimilar minute structure, destitute of lamination, and irregularly\r\narranged. Some of this material gives the impression that there may\r\nhave been organisms similar to Eozoon, but growing in an irregular\r\nor acervuline manner without lamination. Of this, however, I cannot\r\nbe certain; and on the other hand there is distinct evidence of the\r\naggregation of fragments of Eozoon in some of these specimens. In\r\nsome they constitute the greater part of the mass. In others they\r\nare embedded in calcareous matter of a different character, or in\r\nserpentine or granular pyroxene. In most of the specimens the cells of\r\nthe fossils are more or less filled with these minerals; and in some\r\ninstances it would appear that the calcareous matter of fragments of\r\nEozoon has been in part replaced by serpentine.\"\r\n\r\n\"2. Intermixed with the fragments of Eozoon above referred to, are\r\nother calcareous matters apparently fragmentary. They are of various\r\nangular and rounded forms, and present several kinds of structure. The\r\nmost frequent of these is a strong lamination varying in direction\r\naccording to the position of the fragments, but corresponding, as\r\nfar as can be ascertained, with the diagonal of the rhombohedral\r\ncleavage. This structure, though crystalline, is highly characteristic\r\nof crinoidal remains when preserved in altered limestones. The more\r\ndense parts of Eozoon, destitute of tubuli, also sometimes show this\r\nstructure, though less distinctly. Other fragments are compact and\r\nstructureless, or show only a fine granular appearance; and these\r\nsometimes include grains, patches, or fibres of graphite. In Silurian\r\nlimestones, fragments of corals and shells which have been partially\r\ninfiltrated with bituminous matter, show a structure like this. On\r\ncomparison with altered organic limestones of the Silurian system,\r\nthese appearances would indicate that in addition to the debris of\r\nEozoon, other calcareous structures, more like those of crinoids,\r\ncorals, and shells, have contributed to the formation of the\r\nLaurentian limestones.\r\n\r\n\"3. In the serpentine[AE] filling the chambers of a large specimen of\r\nEozoon from Burgess, there are numerous small pieces of foreign matter;\r\nand the silicate itself is laminated, indicating its sedimentary\r\nnature. Some of the included fragments appear to be carbonaceous,\r\nothers calcareous; but no distinct organic structure can be detected\r\nin them. There are, however, in the serpentine, many minute silicious\r\ngrains of a bright green colour, resembling green-sand concretions;\r\nand the manner in which these are occasionally arranged in lines and\r\ngroups, suggests the supposition that they may possibly be casts of\r\nthe interior of minute Foraminiferal shells. They may, however, be\r\nconcretionary in their origin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AE: This is the dark green mineral named loganite by Dr.\r\nHunt.]\r\n\r\n\"4. In some of the Laurentian limestones submitted to me by Sir W.\r\nE. Logan, and in others which I collected some years ago at Madoc,\r\nCanada West, there are fibres and granules of carbonaceous matter,\r\nwhich do not conform to the crystalline structure, and present forms\r\nquite similar to those which in more modern limestones result from\r\nthe decomposition of algæ. Though retaining mere traces of organic\r\nstructure, no doubt would be entertained as to their vegetable origin\r\nif they were found in fossiliferous limestones.\r\n\r\n\"5. A specimen of impure limestone from Madoc, in the collection of\r\nthe Canadian Geological Survey, which seems from its structure to\r\nhave been a finely laminated sediment, shows perforations of various\r\nsizes, somewhat scalloped at the sides, and filled with grains of\r\nrounded silicious sand. In my own collection there are specimens\r\nof micaceous slate from the same region, with indications on their\r\nweathered surfaces of similar rounded perforations, having the aspect\r\nof Scolithus, or of worm-burrows.\r\n\r\n\"Though the abundance and wide distribution of Eozoon, and the\r\nimportant part it seems to have acted in the accumulation of limestone,\r\nindicate that it was one of the most prevalent forms of animal\r\nexistence in the seas of the Laurentian period, the non-existence of\r\nother organic beings is not implied. On the contrary, independently of\r\nthe indications afforded by the limestones themselves, it is evident\r\nthat in order to the existence and growth of these large Rhizopods, the\r\nwaters must have swarmed with more minute animal or vegetable organisms\r\non which they could subsist. On the other hand, though this is a less\r\ncertain inference, the dense calcareous skeleton of Eozoon may indicate\r\nthat it also was liable to the attacks of animal enemies. It is also\r\npossible that the growth of Eozoon, or the deposition of the serpentine\r\nand pyroxene in which its remains have been preserved, or both, may\r\nhave been connected with certain oceanic depths and conditions, and\r\nthat we have as yet revealed to us the life of only certain stations\r\nin the Laurentian seas. Whatever conjectures we may form on these more\r\nproblematic points, the observations above detailed appear to establish\r\nthe following conclusions:--\r\n\r\n\"First, that in the Laurentian period, as in subsequent geological\r\nepochs, the Rhizopods were important agents in the accumulation of\r\nbeds of limestone; and secondly, that in this early period these low\r\nforms of animal life attained to a development, in point of magnitude\r\nand complexity, unexampled, in so far as yet known, in the succeeding\r\nages of the earth's history. This early culmination of the Rhizopods is\r\nin accordance with one of the great laws of the succession of living\r\nbeings, ascertained from the study of the introduction and progress of\r\nother groups; and, should it prove that these great Protozoans were\r\nreally the dominant type of animals in the Laurentian period, this fact\r\nmight be regarded as an indication that in these ancient rocks we may\r\nactually have the records of the first appearance of animal life on our\r\nplanet.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to the first of the above heads, I have now to state\r\nthat it seems quite certain that the upper and younger portions of\r\nthe masses of Eozoon often passed into the acervuline form, and the\r\nperiod in which this change took place seems to have depended on\r\ncircumstances. In some specimens there are only a few regular layers,\r\nand then a heap of irregular cells. In other cases a hundred or more\r\nregular layers were formed; but even in this case little groups of\r\nirregular cells occurred at certain points near the surface. This\r\nmay be seen in plate III. I have also found some masses clearly not\r\nfragmental which consist altogether of acervuline cells. A specimen\r\nof this kind is represented in fig. 31. It is oval in outline, about\r\nthree inches in length, wholly made up of rounded or cylindrical\r\ncells, the walls of which have a beautiful tubular structure, but\r\nthere is little or no supplemental skeleton. Whether this is a portion\r\naccidentally broken off from the top of a mass of Eozoon, or a\r\npeculiar varietal form, or a distinct species, it would be difficult\r\nto determine. In the meantime I have described it as a variety,\r\n\"_acervulina_,\" of the species Eozoon Canadense.[AF] Another variety\r\nalso, from Petite Nation, shows extremely thin laminæ, closely placed\r\ntogether and very massive, and with little supplemental skeleton. This\r\nmay be allied to the last, and may be named variety \"_minor_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote AF: _Proceedings of Geological Society_, 1875.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. _Acervuline Variety of Eozoon, St. Pierre._\r\n\r\n(_a._) General form, half natural size. (_b._) Portion of cellular\r\ninterior, magnified, showing the course of the tubuli.]\r\n\r\nAll this, however, has nothing to do with the layers of fragments of\r\nEozoon which are scattered through the Laurentian limestones. In these\r\nthe fossil is sometimes preserved in the ordinary manner, with its\r\ncavities filled with serpentine, and the thicker parts of the skeleton\r\nhaving their canals filled with this substance. In this case the\r\nchambers may have been occupied with serpentine before it was broken\r\nup. At St. Pierre there are distinct layers of this kind, from half an\r\ninch to several inches in thickness, regularly interstratified with\r\nthe ordinary limestone. In other layers no serpentine occurs, but the\r\ninterstices of the fragments are filled with crystalline dolomite or\r\nmagnesian limestone, which has also penetrated the canals; and there\r\nare indications, though less manifest, that some at least of the layers\r\nof pure limestone are composed of fragmental Eozoon. In the Laurentian\r\nlimestone of Wentworth, belonging apparently to the same band with\r\nthat of St. Pierre, there are many small rounded pieces of limestone,\r\nevidently the debris of some older rock, broken up and rounded by\r\nattrition. In some of these fragments the structure of Eozoon may be\r\nplainly perceived. This shows that still older limestones composed of\r\nEozoon were at that time undergoing waste, and carries our view of the\r\nexistence of this fossil back to the very beginning of the Laurentian.\r\n\r\nWith respect to organic fragments not showing the structure of Eozoon,\r\nI have not as yet been able to refer these to any definite origin. Some\r\nof them may be simply thick portions of the shell of Eozoon with their\r\npores filled with calcite, so as to present a homogeneous appearance.\r\nOthers have much the appearance of fragments of such Primordial forms\r\nas _Archæocyathus_, to be described in the sequel; but after much\r\ncareful search, I have thus far been unable to say more than I could\r\nsay in 1865.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. _Archæospherinæ from St. Pierre._\r\n\r\n(_a._) Specimens dissolved out by acid.

I\r\nhave already referred to and figured (fig. 18) the remarkable rounded\r\nbodies occurring at Long Lake. I now figure similar bodies found mixed\r\nwith fragmental Eozoon and in separate thin layers at St. Pierre (fig.\r\n32), also some of the singular grains found in the loganite occupying\r\nthe chambers of Eozoon from Burgess (fig. 33), and a beaded body set\r\nfree by acid, with others of irregular forms, from the limestone of\r\nWentworth (fig. 34). All these I think are essentially of the same\r\nnature, namely, chambers originally invested with a tubulated wall\r\nlike Eozoon, and aggregated in groups, sometimes in a linear manner,\r\nsometimes spirally, like those Globigerinæ which constitute the mass\r\nof modern deep-sea dredgings and also of the chalk. These bodies occur\r\ndispersed in the limestone, arranged in thin layers parallel to the\r\nbedding or sometimes in the large chamber-cavities of Eozoon. They\r\nare so variable in size and form that it is not unlikely they may be\r\nof different origins. The most probable of these may be thus stated.\r\nFirst, they may in some cases be the looser superficial parts of the\r\nsurface of Eozoon broken up into little groups of cells. Secondly,\r\nthey may be few-celled germs or buds given off from Eozoon. Thirdly,\r\nthey may be smaller Foraminifera, structurally allied to Eozoon, but\r\nin habit of growth resembling those little globe-shaped forms which,\r\nas already stated, abound in chalk and in the modern ocean. The latter\r\nview I should regard as highly probable in the case of many of them;\r\nand I have proposed for them, in consequence, and as a convenient name,\r\n_Archæospherinæ_, or ancient spherical animals.\r\n\r\nCarbonaceous matter is rare in the true Eozoon limestones, and, as\r\nalready stated, I would refer the Laurentian graphite or plumbago\r\nmainly to plants. With regard to the worm-burrows referred to in 1865,\r\nthere can be no doubt of their nature, but there is some doubt as to\r\nwhether the beds that contain them are really Lower Laurentian. They\r\nmay be Upper Laurentian or Huronian. I give here figures of these\r\nburrows as published in 1866[AG] (fig. 35). The rocks which contain\r\nthem hold also fragments of Eozoon, and are not known to contain other\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AG: _Journal of Geological Society._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. _Annelid Burrows, Laurentian or Huronian._\r\n\r\nFig 1. _Transverse section of Worm-burrow_--magnified, as a transparent\r\nobject.

I do not vouch\r\nfor them as Laurentian, and if of that age they seem to indicate a\r\nspecies distinct from that of Canada proper. They differ in coarser\r\ntubulation, and in their canals being large and beaded, and less\r\ndivergent. I proposed for these specimens, in some notes contributed to\r\nthe survey of Canada, the name _Eozoon Acadianum_.\r\n\r\nDr. Gümbel, the Director of the Geological Survey of Bavaria, is\r\none of the most active and widely informed of European geologists,\r\ncombining European knowledge with an extensive acquaintance with the\r\nlarger and in some respects more typical areas of the older rocks in\r\nAmerica, and stratigraphical geology with enthusiastic interest in the\r\nmicroscopic structures of fossils. He at once and in a most able manner\r\ntook up the question of the application of the discoveries in Canada\r\nto the rocks of Bavaria. The spirit in which he did so may be inferred\r\nfrom the following extract:--\r\n\r\n\"The discovery of organic remains in the crystalline limestones of the\r\nancient gneiss of Canada, for which we are indebted to the researches\r\nof Sir William Logan and his colleagues, and to the careful microscopic\r\ninvestigations of Drs. Dawson and Carpenter, must be regarded as\r\nopening a new era in geological science.\r\n\r\n\"This discovery overturns at once the notions hitherto commonly\r\nentertained with regard to the origin of the stratified primary\r\nlimestones, and their accompanying gneissic and quartzose strata,\r\nincluded under the general name of primitive crystalline schists. It\r\nshows us that these crystalline stratified rocks, of the so-called\r\nprimary system, are only a backward prolongation of the chain of\r\nfossiliferous strata; the elements of which were deposited as oceanic\r\nsediment, like the clay-slates, limestones, and sandstones of the\r\npalæozoic formations, and under similar conditions, though at a time\r\nfar more remote, and more favourable to the generation of crystalline\r\nmineral compounds.\r\n\r\n\"In this discovery of organic remains in the primary rocks, we hail\r\nwith joy the dawn of a new epoch in the critical history of these\r\nearlier formations. Already in its light, the primeval geological time\r\nis seen to be everywhere animated, and peopled with new animal forms\r\nof whose very existence we had previously no suspicion. Life, which\r\nhad hitherto been supposed to have first appeared in the Primordial\r\ndivision of the Silurian period, is now seen to be immeasurably\r\nlengthened beyond its former limit, and to embrace in its domain the\r\nmost ancient known portions of the earth's crust. It would almost\r\nseem as if organic life had been awakened simultaneously with the\r\nsolidification of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\n\"The great importance of this discovery cannot be clearly understood,\r\nunless we first consider the various and conflicting opinions\r\nand theories which had hitherto been maintained concerning the\r\norigin of these primary rocks. Thus some, who consider them as the\r\nfirst-formed crust of a previously molten globe, regard their apparent\r\nstratification as a kind of concentric parallel structure, developed\r\nin the progressive cooling of the mass from without. Others, while\r\nadmitting a similar origin of these rocks, suppose their division\r\ninto parallel layers to be due, like the lamination of clay-slates,\r\nto lateral pressure. If we admit such views, the igneous origin of\r\nschistose rocks becomes conceivable, and is in fact maintained by many.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, we have the school which, while recognising the\r\nsedimentary origin of these crystalline schists, supposes them to\r\nhave been metamorphosed at a later period; either by the internal\r\nheat, acting in the deeply buried strata; by the proximity of eruptive\r\nrocks; or finally, through the agency of permeating waters charged with\r\ncertain mineral salts.\r\n\r\n\"A few geologists only have hitherto inclined to the opinion that\r\nthese crystalline schists, while possessing real stratification,\r\nand sedimentary in their origin, were formed at a period when the\r\nconditions were more favourable to the production of crystalline\r\nmaterials than at present. According to this view, the crystalline\r\nstructure of these rocks is an original condition, and not one\r\nsuperinduced at a later period by metamorphosis. In order, however,\r\nto arrange and classify these ancient crystalline rocks, it becomes\r\nnecessary to establish by superposition, or by other evidence,\r\ndifferences in age, such as are recognised in the more recent\r\nstratified deposits. The discovery of similar organic remains,\r\noccupying a determinate position in the stratification, in different\r\nand remote portions of these primitive rocks, furnishes a powerful\r\nargument in favour of the latter view, as opposed to the notion which\r\nmaintains the metamorphic origin of the various minerals and rocks of\r\nthese ancient formations; so that we may regard the direct formation of\r\nthese mineral elements, at least so far as these fossiliferous primary\r\nlimestones are concerned, as an established fact.\"\r\n\r\nHis first discovery is thus recorded, in terms which show the very\r\nclose resemblance of the Bavarian and Canadian Eozoic.\r\n\r\n\"My discovery of similar organic remains in the serpentine-limestone\r\nfrom near Passau was made in 1865, when I had returned from my\r\ngeological labours of the summer, and received the recently published\r\ndescriptions of Messrs. Logan, Dawson, etc. Small portions of this\r\nrock, gathered in the progress of the Geological Survey in 1854,\r\nand ever since preserved in my collection, having been submitted\r\nto microscopic examination, confirmed in the most brilliant manner\r\nthe acute judgment of the Canadian geologists, and furnished\r\npalæontological evidence that, notwithstanding the great distance which\r\nseparates Canada from Bavaria, the equivalent primitive rocks of the\r\ntwo regions are characterized by similar organic remains; showing at\r\nthe same time that the law governing the definite succession of organic\r\nlife on the earth is maintained even in these most ancient formations.\r\nThe fragments of serpentine-limestone, or ophicalcite, in which I first\r\ndetected the existence of Eozoon, were like those described in Canada,\r\nin which the lamellar structure is wanting, and offer only what Dr.\r\nCarpenter has called an acervuline structure. For further confirmation\r\nof my observations, I deemed it advisable, through the kindness of\r\nSir Charles Lyell, to submit specimens of the Bavarian rock to the\r\nexamination of that eminent authority, Dr. Carpenter, who, without any\r\nhesitation, declared them to contain Eozoon.\r\n\r\n\"This fact being established, I procured from the quarries near Passau\r\nas many specimens of the limestone as the advanced season of the year\r\nwould permit; and, aided by my diligent and skillful assistants,\r\nMessrs. Reber and Schwager, examined them by the methods indicated by\r\nMessrs. Dawson and Carpenter. In this way I soon convinced myself of\r\nthe general similarity of our organic remains with those of Canada.\r\nOur examinations were made on polished sections and in portions etched\r\nwith dilute nitric acid, or, better, with warm acetic acid. The most\r\nbeautiful results were however obtained by etching moderately thin\r\nsections, so that the specimens may be examined at will either by\r\nreflected or transmitted light.\r\n\r\n\"The specimens in which I first detected Eozoon came from a quarry\r\nat Steinhag, near Obernzell, on the Danube, not far from Passau. The\r\ncrystalline limestone here forms a mass from fifty to seventy feet\r\nthick, divided into several beds, included in the gneiss, whose general\r\nstrike in this region is N.W., with a dip of 40°-60° N.E. The limestone\r\nstrata of Steinhag have a dip of 45° N.E. The gneiss of this vicinity\r\nis chiefly grey, and very silicious, containing dichroite, and of\r\nthe variety known as dichroite-gneiss; and I conceive it to belong,\r\nlike the gneiss of Bodenmais and Arber, to that younger division of\r\nthe primitive gneiss system which I have designated as the Hercynian\r\ngneiss formation; which, both to the north, between Tischenreuth and\r\nMahring, and to the south on the north-west of the mountains of Ossa,\r\nis immediately overlaid by the mica-slate formation. Lithologically,\r\nthis newer division of the gneiss is characterized by the predominance\r\nof a grey variety, rich in quartz, with black magnesian-mica and\r\northoclase, besides which a small quantity of oligoclase is never\r\nwanting. A further characteristic of this Hercynian gneiss is the\r\nfrequent intercalation of beds of rocks rich in hornblende, such as\r\nhornblende-schist, amphibolite, diorite, syenite, and syenitic granite,\r\nand also of serpentine and granulite. Beds of granular limestone,\r\nor of calcareous schists are also never altogether wanting; while\r\niron pyrites and graphite, in lenticular masses, or in local beds\r\nconformable to the great mass of the gneiss strata, are very generally\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\"In the large quarry of Steinhag, from which I first obtained the\r\nEozoon, the enclosing rock is a grey hornblendic gneiss, which\r\nsometimes passes into a hornblende-slate. The limestone is in many\r\nplaces overlaid by a bed of hornblende-schist, sometimes five feet\r\nin thickness, which separates it from the normal gneiss. In many\r\nlocalities, a bed of serpentine, three or four feet thick, is\r\ninterposed between the limestone and the hornblende-schist; and in\r\nsome cases a zone, consisting chiefly of scapolite, crystalline and\r\nalmost compact, with an admixture however of hornblende and chlorite.\r\nBelow the serpentine band, the crystalline limestone appears divided\r\ninto distinct beds, and encloses various accidental minerals, among\r\nwhich are reddish-white mica, chlorite, hornblende, tremolite,\r\nchondrodite, rosellan, garnet, and scapolite, arranged in bands.\r\nIn several places the lime is mingled with serpentine, grains or\r\nportions of which, often of the size of peas, are scattered through\r\nthe limestone with apparent irregularity, giving rise to a beautiful\r\nvariety of ophicalcite or serpentine-marble. These portions, which are\r\nenclosed in the limestone destitute of serpentine, always present a\r\nrounded outline. In one instance there appears, in a high naked wall\r\nof limestone without serpentine, the outline of a mass of ophicalcite,\r\nabout sixteen feet long and twenty-five feet high, which, rising from\r\na broad base, ends in a point, and is separated from the enclosing\r\nlimestone by an undulating but clearly defined margin, as already well\r\ndescribed by Wineberger. This mass of ophicalcite recalls vividly a\r\nreef-like structure. Within this and similar masses of ophicalcite in\r\nthe crystalline limestone, there are, so far as my observations in 1854\r\nextend, no continuous lines or concentric layers of serpentine to be\r\nobserved, this mineral being always distributed in small grains and\r\npatches. The few apparently regular layers which may be observed are\r\nsoon interrupted, and the whole aggregation is irregular.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this acervuline Eozoon of Steinhag appears to\r\nexist in large reefs, and that in its want of lamination it differs\r\nfrom the Canadian examples. In fossils of low organization, like\r\nForaminifera, such differences are often accidental and compatible with\r\nspecific unity, but yet there may be a difference specifically in the\r\nBavarian Eozoon as compared with the Canadian.\r\n\r\nGümbel also found in the Finnish and Bavarian limestones knotted\r\nchambers, like those of Wentworth above mentioned (fig. 36), which he\r\nregards as belonging to some other organism than Eozoon; and flocculi\r\nhaving tubes, pores, and reticulations which would seem to point to the\r\npresence of structures akin to sponges or possibly remains of seaweeds.\r\nThese observations Gümbel has extended into other localities in Bavaria\r\nand Bohemia, and also in Silesia and Sweden, establishing the existence\r\nof Eozoon fossils in all the Laurentian limestones of the middle and\r\nnorth of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. _Archæospherinæ from Pargas in Finland._\r\n(_After Gümbel._)\r\n\r\nMagnified.]\r\n\r\nGümbel has further found in beds overlying the older Eozoic series,\r\nand probably of the same age with the Canadian Huronian, a different\r\nspecies of Eozoon, with smaller and more contracted chambers, and\r\nstill finer and more crowded canals. This, which is to be regarded as\r\na distinct species, or at least a well-marked varietal form, he has\r\nnamed _Eozoon Bavaricum_ (fig. 37). Thus this early introduction of\r\nlife is not peculiar to that old continent which we sometimes call the\r\nNew World, but applies to Europe as well, and Europe has furnished a\r\nsuccessor to Eozoon in the later Eozoic or Huronian period. In rocks of\r\nthis age in America, after long search and much slicing of limestones,\r\nI have hitherto failed to find any decided organic remains other than\r\nthe Tudor and Madoc specimens of Eozoon. If these are really Huronian\r\nand not Laurentian, the Eozoon from this horizon does not sensibly\r\ndiffer from that of the Lower Laurentian. The curious limpet-like\r\nobjects from Newfoundland, discovered by Murray, and described by\r\nBillings,[AH] under the name _Aspidella_, are believed to be Huronian,\r\nbut they have no connection with Eozoon, and therefore need not detain\r\nus here.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AH: _Canadian Naturalist_, 1871.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. _Section of Eozoon Bavaricum, with Serpentine,\r\nfrom the Crystalline Limestone of the Hercynian primitive Clay-state\r\nFormation at Hohenberg; 25 diameters._\r\n\r\n(_a._) Sparry carbonate of lime. (_b._) Cellular carbonate of lime.\r\n(_c._) System of tubuli. (_d._) Serpentine replacing the coarser\r\nordinary variety. (_e._) Serpentine and hornblende replacing the finer\r\nvariety, in the very much contorted portions.]\r\n\r\nLeaving the Eozoic age, we find ourselves next in the Primordial or\r\nCambrian, and here we discover the sea already tenanted by many\r\nkinds of crustaceans and shell-fishes, which have been collected and\r\ndescribed by palæontologists in Bohemia, Scandinavia, Wales, and North\r\nAmerica;[AI] curiously enough, however, the rocks of this age are\r\nnot so rich in Foraminifera as those of some succeeding periods. Had\r\nthis primitive type played out its part in the Eozoic and exhausted\r\nits energies, and did it remain in abeyance in the Primordial age to\r\nresume its activity in the succeeding times? It is not necessary to\r\nbelieve this. The geologist is familiar with the fact, that in one\r\nformation he may have before him chiefly oceanic and deep-sea deposits,\r\nand in another those of the shallower waters, and that alternations\r\nof these may, in the same age or immediately succeeding ages, present\r\nvery different groups of fossils. Now the rocks and fossils of the\r\nLaurentian seem to be oceanic in character, while the Huronian and\r\nearly Primordial rocks evidence great disturbances, and much coarse\r\nand muddy sediment, such as that found in shallows or near the land.\r\nThey abound in coarse conglomerates, sandstones and thick beds of slate\r\nor shale, but are not rich in limestones, which do not in the parts\r\nof the world yet explored regain their importance till the succeeding\r\nSiluro-Cambrian age. No doubt there were, in the Primordial, deep-sea\r\nareas swarming with Foraminifera, the successors of Eozoon; but these\r\nare as yet unknown or little known, and our known Primordial fauna is\r\nchiefly that of the shallows. Enlarged knowledge may thus bridge over\r\nmuch of the apparent gap in the life of these two great periods.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AI: Barrande, Angelin, Hicks, Hall, Billings, etc.]\r\n\r\nOnly as yet on the coast of Labrador and neighbouring parts of North\r\nAmerica, and in rocks that were formed in seas that washed the old\r\nLaurentian rocks, in which Eozoon was already as fully sealed up as\r\nit is at this moment, do we find Protozoa which can claim any near\r\nkinship to the proto-foraminifer. These are the fossils of the genus\r\n_Archæocyathus_--\"ancient cup-sponges, or cup-foraminifers,\" which\r\nhave been described in much detail by Mr. Billings in the reports of\r\nthe Canadian Survey. Mr. Billings regards them as possibly sponges,\r\nor as intermediate between these and Foraminifera, and the silicious\r\nspicules found in some of them justify this view, unless indeed, as\r\npartly suspected by Mr. Billings, these belong to true sponges which\r\nmay have grown along with Archæocyathus or attached to it. Certain\r\nit is, however, that if allied to sponges, they are allied also to\r\nForaminifera, and that some of them deviate altogether from the sponge\r\ntype and become calcareous chambered bodies, the animals of which can\r\nhave differed very little from those of the Laurentian Eozoon. It is\r\nto these calcareous Foraminiferal species that I shall at present\r\nrestrict my attention. I give a few figures, for which I am indebted to\r\nMr. Billings, of three of his species (figs. 38 to 40), with enlarged\r\ndrawings of the structures of one of them which has the most decidedly\r\nforaminiferal characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. _Archæocyathus Minganensis--a Primordial\r\nProtozoon._ (_After Billings._)\r\n\r\n(_a._) Pores of the inner wall.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. _Archæocyathus profundus--showing the base of\r\nattachment and radiating chambers._ (_After Billings._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. _Archæocyathus Atlanticus--showing outer\r\nsurface and longitudinal and transverse sections._ (_After Billings._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. _Structures of Archæocyathus Profundus._\r\n\r\n(_a._) Lower acervuline portion. (_b._) Upper portion, with three of\r\nthe radiating laminæ. (_c._) Portion of lamina with pores and thickened\r\npart with canals. In figs. _a_ and _b_ the calcareous part is unshaded.]\r\n\r\nTo understand Archæocyathus, let us imagine an inverted cone of\r\ncarbonate of lime from an inch or two to a foot in length, and with\r\nits point buried in the mud at the bottom of the sea, while its open\r\ncup extends upward into the water. The lower part buried in the soil\r\nis composed of an irregular acervuline network of thick calcareous\r\nplates, enclosing chambers communicating with one another (figs. 40\r\nand 41 A). Above this where the cup expands, its walls are composed\r\nof thin outer and inner plates, perforated with innumerable holes,\r\nand connected with each other by vertical plates, which are also\r\nperforated with round pores, establishing a communication between the\r\nradiating chambers into which they divide the thickness of the wall\r\n(figs. 38, 39, and 41 B). In such a structure the chambers in the wall\r\nof the cup and the irregular chambers of the base would be filled with\r\ngelatinous animal matter, and the pseudopods would project from the\r\nnumerous pores in the inner and outer wall. In the older parts of the\r\nskeleton, the structure is further complicated by the formation of\r\nthin transverse plates, irregular in distribution, and where greater\r\nstrength is required a calcareous thickening is added, which in some\r\nplaces shows a canal system like that of Eozoon (fig. 41, B, C).[AJ]\r\nAs compared with Eozoon, the fossils want its fine perforated wall,\r\nbut have a more regular plan of growth. There are fragments in the\r\nEozoon limestones which may have belonged to structures like these;\r\nand when we know more of the deep sea of the Primordial, we may\r\nrecover true species of Eozoon from it, or may find forms intermediate\r\nbetween it and Archæocyathus. In the meantime I know no nearer bond of\r\nconnection between Eozoon and the Primordial age than that furnished\r\nby the ancient cup Zoophytes of Labrador, though I have searched very\r\ncarefully in the fossiliferous conglomerates of Cambrian age on the\r\nLower St. Lawrence, which contain rocks of all the formations from the\r\nLaurentian upwards, often with characteristic fossils. I have also made\r\nsections of many of the fossiliferous pebbles in these conglomerates\r\nwithout finding any certain remains of such organisms, though the\r\nfragments of the crusts of some of the Primordial tribolites, when\r\ntheir tubuli are infiltrated with dark carbonaceous matter, are so like\r\nthe supplemental skeleton of Eozoon, that but for their forms they\r\nmight readily be mistaken for it; and associated with them are broken\r\npieces of other porous organisms which may belong to Protozoa, though\r\nthis is not yet certain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AJ: On the whole these curious fossils, if regarded as\r\nForaminifera, are most nearly allied to the Orbitolites and Dactyloporæ\r\nof the Early Tertiary period, as described by Carpenter.]\r\n\r\nOf all the fossils of the Silurian rocks those which most resemble\r\nEozoon are the _Stromatoporæ_, or \"layer-corals,\" whose resemblance\r\nto the old Laurentian fossil at once struck Sir William Logan; and\r\nthese occur in the earliest great oceanic limestones which succeed the\r\nPrimordial period, those of the Trenton group, in the Siluro-Cambrian.\r\nFrom this they extend upward as far as the Devonian, appearing\r\neverywhere in the limestones, and themselves often constituting large\r\nmasses of calcareous rock. Our figure (fig. 42) shows a small example\r\nof one of these fossils; and when sawn asunder or broken across and\r\nweathered, they precisely resemble Eozoon in general appearance,\r\nespecially when, as sometimes happens, their cell-walls have been\r\nsilicified.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. _Stromatopora rugosa, Hall--Lower Silurian,\r\nCanada._ (_After Billings._)\r\n\r\nThe specimen is of smaller size than usual, and is silicified. It is\r\nprobably inverted in position, and the concentric marks on the outer\r\nsurface are due to concretions of silica.]\r\n\r\nThere are, however, different types of these fossils. The most common,\r\nthe Stromatoporæ properly so called, consist of concentric layers of\r\ncalcareous matter attached to each other by pillar-like processes,\r\nwhich, as well as the layers, are made up of little threads of\r\nlimestone netted together, or radiating from the tops and bottoms of\r\nthe pillars, and forming a very porous substance. Though they have\r\nbeen regarded as corals by some, they are more generally believed\r\nto be Protozoa; but whether more nearly allied to sponges or to\r\nForaminifera may admit of doubt. Some of the more porous kinds are\r\nnot very dissimilar from calcareous sponges, but they generally want\r\ntrue oscula and pores, and seem better adapted to shield the gelatinous\r\nbody of a Foraminifer projecting pseudopods in search of food, than\r\nthat of a sponge, living by the introduction of currents of water. Many\r\nof the denser kinds, however, have their calcareous floors so solid\r\nthat they must be regarded as much more nearly akin to Foraminifers,\r\nand some of them have the same irregular inosculation of these floors\r\nobserved in Eozoon. Figs. 43, A to D, show portions of species of\r\nthis description, in which the resemblance to Eozoon in structure and\r\narrangement of parts is not remote.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. _Structures of Stromatopora._\r\n\r\n(_a._) Portion of an oblique section magnified, showing laminæ and\r\ncolumns. (_b._) Portion of wall with pores, and crusted on both sides\r\nwith quartz crystals. (_c._) Thickened portion of wall with canals.\r\n(_d._) Portion of another specimen, showing irregular laminæ and\r\npillars.]\r\n\r\nThese fossils, however, show no very distinct canal system or\r\nsupplemental skeleton, but this also appears in those forms which have\r\nbeen called Caunopora or Cœnostroma. In these the plates are traversed\r\nby tubes, or groups of tubes, which in each successive floor give out\r\nradiating and branching canals exactly like those of Eozoon, though\r\nmore regularly arranged; and if we had specimens with the canals\r\ninfiltrated with glauconite or serpentine, the resemblance would be\r\nperfect. When, as in figs. 44 and 45 A, these canals are seen on the\r\nabraded surface, they appear as little grooves arranged in stars,\r\nwhich resemble the radiating plates of corals, but this resemblance\r\nis altogether superficial, and I have no doubt that they are really\r\nforaminiferal organisms. This will appear more distinctly from the\r\nsections in fig. 45 B, C, which represents an undescribed species\r\nrecently found by Mr. Weston, in the Upper Silurian limestone of\r\nOntario.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. _Caunopora planulata, Hall--Devonian; showing\r\nthe radiating canals on a weathered surface._ (_After Hall._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45. _Cœnostroma--Guelph Limestone, Upper Silurian,\r\nfrom a specimen collected by Mr. Weston, showing the canals._\r\n\r\n(_a._) Surface with canals, natural size. (_b._) Vertical section,\r\nnatural size. (_c._) The same magnified, showing canals and laminæ.]\r\n\r\nThere are probably many species of these curious fossils, but their\r\ndiscrimination is difficult, and their nomenclature confused, so that\r\nit would not be profitable to engage the attention of the reader\r\nwith it except in a note. Their state of preservation, however, is\r\nso highly illustrative of that of Eozoon that a word as to this\r\nwill not be out of place. They are sometimes preserved merely by\r\ninfiltration with calcite or dolomite, and in this case it is most\r\ndifficult to make out their minute structures. Often they appear\r\nmerely as concentrically laminated masses which, but for their mode\r\nof occurrence, might be regarded as mere concretions. In other cases\r\nthe cell-walls and pillars are perfectly silicified, and then they\r\nform beautiful microscopic objects, especially when decalcified with\r\nan acid. In still other cases, they are preserved like Eozoon, the\r\nwalls being calcareous and the chambers filled with silica. In this\r\nstate when weathered or decalcified they are remarkably like Eozoon,\r\nbut I have not met with any having their minute pores and tubes so\r\nwell preserved as in some of the Laurentian fossils. In many of them,\r\nhowever, the growth and overlapping of the successive amœba-like coats\r\nof sarcode can be beautifully seen, exactly as on the surface of a\r\ndecalcified piece of Eozoon. Those in my collection which most nearly\r\nresemble the Laurentian specimens are from the older part of the Lower\r\nSilurian series; but unfortunately their minute structures are not well\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nIn the Silurian and Devonian ages, these Stromatoporæ evidently carried\r\nout the same function as the Eozoon in the Laurentian. Winchell tells\r\nus that in Michigan and Ohio single specimens can be found several feet\r\nin diameter, and that they constitute the mass of considerable beds of\r\nlimestone. I have myself seen in Canada specimens a foot in diameter,\r\nwith a great number of laminæ. Lindberg[AK] has given a most vivid\r\naccount of their occurrence in the Isle of Gothland. He says that they\r\nform beds of large irregular discs and balls, attaining a thickness of\r\nfive Swedish feet, and traceable for miles along the coast, and the\r\nindividual balls are sometimes a yard in diameter. In some of them the\r\nstructure is beautifully preserved. In others, or in parts of them,\r\nit is reduced to a mass of crystalline limestone. This species is of\r\nthe Cœnostroma type, and is regarded by Lindberg as a coral, though\r\nhe admits its low type and resemblance to Protozoa. Its continuous\r\ncalcareous skeleton he rightly regards as fatal to its claim to be a\r\ntrue sponge. Such a fossil, differing as it does in minute points of\r\nstructure from Eozoon, is nevertheless probably allied to it in no very\r\ndistant way, and a successor to its limestone-making function. Those\r\nwhich most nearly approach to Foraminifera are those with thick and\r\nsolid calcareous laminæ, and with a radiating canal system; and one\r\nof the most Eozoon-like I have seen, is a specimen of the undescribed\r\nspecies already mentioned from the Guelph (Upper Silurian) limestone\r\nof Ontario, collected by Mr. Weston, and now in the Museum of the\r\nGeological Survey. I have attempted to represent its structures in fig.\r\n44.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AK: _Transactions of Swedish Academy_, 1870.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46. _Receptaculites, restored._ (_After Billings._)\r\n\r\n(_a._) Aperture.

These curious and beautiful fossils, which sometimes\r\nare a foot in diameter, consist, like Archæocyathus, of an outer and\r\ninner coat enclosing a cavity; but these coats are composed of square\r\nplates with pores at the corners, and they are connected by hollow\r\npillars passing in a regular manner from the outer to the inner coat.\r\nThey have been regarded by Salter as Foraminifers, while Billings\r\nconsiders their nearest analogues to be the seed-like germs of some\r\nmodern silicious sponges. On the whole, if not Foraminifera, they must\r\nhave been organisms intermediate between these and sponges, and they\r\ncertainly constitute one of the most beautiful and complex types of\r\nthe ancient Protozoa, showing the wonderful perfection to which these\r\ncreatures attained at a very early period. (Figs. 46, 47, 48.)\r\n\r\nI might trace these ancient forms of foraminiferal life further up in\r\nthe geological series, and show how in the Carboniferous there are\r\nnummulitic shells conforming to the general type of Eozoon, and in some\r\ncases making up the mass of great limestones.[AL] Further, in the great\r\nchalk series and its allied beds, and in the Lower Tertiary, there are\r\nnot only vast foraminiferal limestones, but gigantic species reminding\r\nus of Stromatopora and Eozoon.[AM] Lastly, more diminutive species are\r\ndoing similar work on a great scale in the modern ocean. Thus we may\r\ngather up the broken links of the chain of foraminiferal life, and\r\naffirm that Eozoon has never wanted some representative to uphold its\r\nfamily and function throughout all the vast lapse of geological time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AL: _Fusulina_, as recently described by Carpenter,\r\n_Archæodiscus_ of Brady, and the Nummulite recently found in the\r\nCarboniferous of Belgium.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AM: _Parkeria_ and _Loftusia_ of Carpenter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n(A.) Stromatoporidæ, Etc.\r\n\r\n  For the best description of Archæocyathus, I may refer to _The\r\n  Palæozoic Fossils of Canada_, by Mr. Billings, vol. i. There also,\r\n  and in Mr. Salter's memoir in _The Decades of the Canadian Survey_,\r\n  will be found all that is known of the structure of Receptaculites.\r\n  For the American Stromatoporæ I may refer to Winchell's paper in the\r\n  _Proceedings of the American Association_, 1866; to Professor Hall's\r\n  Descriptions of New Species of Fossils from Iowa, _Report of the\r\n  State Cabinet, Albany_, 1872; and to the Descriptions of Canadian\r\n  Species by Dr. Nicholson, in his _Report on the Palæontology of\r\n  Ontario_, 1874.\r\n\r\n  The genus Stromatopora of Goldfuss was defined by him as consisting\r\n  of laminæ of a solid and porous character, alternating and\r\n  contiguous, and constituting a hemispherical or sub-globose mass.\r\n  In this definition, the porous strata are really those of the\r\n  fossil, the alternating solid strata being the stony filling of the\r\n  chambers; and the descriptions of subsequent authors have varied\r\n  according as, from the state of preservation of the specimens or\r\n  other circumstances, the original laminæ or the filling of the spaces\r\n  attracted their attention. In the former case the fossil could be\r\n  described as consisting of laminæ made up of interlaced fibrils of\r\n  calcite, radiating from vertical pillars which connect the laminæ.\r\n  In the latter case, the laminæ, appear as solid plates, separated\r\n  by very narrow spaces, and perforated with round vertical holes\r\n  representing the connecting pillars. These Stromatoporæ range from\r\n  the Lower Silurian to the Devonian, inclusive, and many species have\r\n  been described; but their limits are not very definite, though there\r\n  are undoubtedly remarkable differences in the distances of the laminæ\r\n  and in their texture, and in the smooth or mammillated character\r\n  of the masses. Hall's genus Stromatocerium belongs to these forms,\r\n  and D'Orbigny's genus Sparsispongia refers to mammillated species,\r\n  sometimes with apparent oscula.\r\n\r\n  Phillip's genus Caunopora was formed to receive specimens with\r\n  concentric cellular layers traversed by \"long vermiform cylindrical\r\n  canals;\" while Winchell's genus Cœnostroma includes species with\r\n  these vermiform canals arranged in a radiate manner, diverging from\r\n  little eminences in the concentric laminæ. The distinction between\r\n  these last genera does not seem to be very clear, and may depend\r\n  on the state of preservation of the specimens. A more important\r\n  distinction appears to exist between those that have a single\r\n  vertical canal from which the subordinate canals diverge, and those\r\n  that have groups of such canals.\r\n\r\n  Some species of the Cœnostroma group have very dense calcareous\r\n  laminæ traversed by the canals; but it does not seem that any\r\n  distinction has yet been made between the proper wall and the\r\n  intermediate skeleton; and most observers have been prevented from\r\n  attending to such structures by the prevailing idea that these\r\n  fossils are either corals or sponges, while the state of preservation\r\n  of the more delicate tissues is often very imperfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B.) Localities of Eozoon, or of Limestones supposed to contain it.\r\n\r\n  In Canada the principal localities of Eozoon Canadense are at\r\n  Grenville, Petite Nation, the Calumets Rapids, Burgess, Tudor, and\r\n  Madoc. At the two last places the fossil occurs in beds which may be\r\n  on a somewhat higher horizon than the others. Mr. Vennor has recently\r\n  found specimens which have the general form of Eozoon, though the\r\n  minute structure is not preserved, at Dalhousie, in Lanark Co.,\r\n  Ontario. One specimen from this place is remarkable from having been\r\n  mineralized in part by a talcose mineral associated with serpentine.\r\n\r\n  I have examined specimens from Chelmsford, in Massachusetts, and from\r\n  Amity and Warren County, New York, the latter from the collection of\r\n  Professor D. S. Martin, which show the canals of Eozoon in a fair\r\n  state of preservation, though the specimens are fragmental, and do\r\n  not show the laminated structure.\r\n\r\n  In European specimens of limestones of Laurentian age, from Tunaberg\r\n  and Fahlun in Sweden, and from the Western Islands of Scotland, I\r\n  have hitherto failed to recognise the characteristic structure of\r\n  the fossil. Connemara specimens have also failed to afford me any\r\n  satisfactory results, and specimens of a serpentine limestone from\r\n  the Alps, collected by M. Favre, and communicated to me by Dr. Hunt,\r\n  though in general texture they much resemble acervuline Eozoon, do\r\n  not show its minute structures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                                                             Plate VII.\r\n\r\n  _Untouched nature-print of part of a large specimen of Eozoon, from\r\n                            Petite Nation._\r\n\r\nThe lighter portions are less perfect than in the original, owing to\r\nthe finer laminæ of serpentine giving way. The dark band at one side is\r\none of the deep lacunæ or oscula.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nOPPONENTS AND OBJECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe active objectors to the animal nature of Eozoon have been few,\r\nthough some of them have returned to the attack with a pertinacity and\r\ndetermination which would lead one to believe that they think the most\r\nsacred interests of science to be dependent on the annihilation of this\r\nproto-foraminifer. I do not propose here to treat of the objections in\r\ndetail. I have presented the case of Eozoon on its own merits, and on\r\nthese it must stand. I may merely state that the objectors strive to\r\naccount for the existence of Eozoon by purely mineral deposition, and\r\nthat the complicated changes which they require to suppose are perhaps\r\nthe strongest indirect evidence for the necessity of regarding the\r\nstructures as organic. The reader who desires to appreciate this may\r\nconsult the notes to this chapter.[AN]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AN: Also Rowney and King's papers in _Journal Geological\r\nSociety_, August, 1866; and _Proceedings Irish Academy_, 1870 and 1871.]\r\n\r\nI confess that I feel disposed to treat very tenderly the position of\r\nobjectors. The facts I have stated make large demands on the faith\r\nof the greater part even of naturalists. Very few geologists or\r\nnaturalists have much knowledge of the structure of foraminiferal\r\nshells, or would be able under the microscope to recognise them with\r\ncertainty. Nor have they any distinct ideas of the appearances of such\r\nstructures under different kinds of preservation and mineralisation.\r\nFurther, they have long been accustomed to regard the so-called Azoic\r\nrocks as not only destitute of organic remains, but as being in such\r\na state of metamorphism that these could not have been preserved had\r\nthey existed. Few, therefore, are able intelligently to decide for\r\nthemselves, and so they are called on to trust to the investigations\r\nof others, and on their testimony to modify in a marked degree their\r\nprevious beliefs as to the duration of life on our planet. In these\r\ncircumstances it is rather wonderful that the researches made with\r\nreference to Eozoon have met with so general acceptance, and that the\r\nresurrection of this ancient inhabitant of the earth has not aroused\r\nmore of the sceptical tendency of our age.\r\n\r\nIt must not be lost sight of, however, that in such cases there may\r\nexist a large amount of undeveloped and even unconscious scepticism,\r\nwhich shows itself not in active opposition, but merely in quietly\r\nignoring this great discovery, or regarding it with doubt, as an\r\nuncertain or unestablished point in science. Such scepticism may best\r\nbe met by the plain and simple statements in the foregoing chapters,\r\nand by the illustrations accompanying them. It may nevertheless be\r\nprofitable to review some of the points referred to, and to present\r\nsome considerations making the existence of Laurentian life less\r\nanomalous than may at first sight be supposed. One of these is the\r\nfact that the discovery of Eozoon brings the rocks of the Laurentian\r\nsystem into more full harmony with the other geological formations. It\r\nexplains the origin of the Laurentian limestones in consistency with\r\nthat of similar rocks in the later periods, and in like manner it helps\r\nus to account for the graphite and sulphides and iron ores of these old\r\nrocks. It shows us that no time was lost in the introduction of life\r\non the earth. Otherwise there would have been a vast lapse of time in\r\nwhich, while the conditions suitable to life were probably present, no\r\nliving thing existed to take advantage of these conditions. Further, it\r\ngives a more simple beginning of life than that afforded by the more\r\ncomplex fauna of the Primordial age; and this is more in accordance\r\nwith what we know of the slow and gradual introduction of new forms of\r\nliving things during the vast periods of Palæozoic time. In connection\r\nwith this it opens a new and promising field of observation in the\r\nolder rocks, and if this should prove fertile, its exploration may\r\nafford a vast harvest of new forms to the geologists of the present and\r\ncoming time. This result will be in entire accordance with what has\r\ntaken place before in the history of geological discovery. It is not\r\nvery long since the old and semi-metamorphic sediments constituting the\r\ngreat Silurian and Cambrian systems were massed together in geological\r\nclassifications as primitive or primary rocks, destitute or nearly\r\ndestitute of organic remains. The brilliant discoveries of Sedgwick,\r\nMurchison, Barrande, and a host of others, have peopled these once\r\nbarren regions; and they now stretch before our wondering gaze in\r\nthe long vistas of early Palæozoic life. So we now look out from the\r\nCambrian shore upon the vast ocean of the Huronian and Laurentian,\r\nall to us yet tenantless, except for the few organisms, which, like\r\nstray shells cast upon the beach, or a far-off land dimly seen in the\r\ndistance, incite to further researches, and to the exploration of the\r\nunknown treasures that still lie undiscovered. It would be a suitable\r\nculmination of the geological work of the last half-century, and one\r\nwithin reach at least of our immediate successors, to fill up this\r\ngreat blank, and to trace back the Primordial life to the stage of\r\nEozoon, and perhaps even beyond this, to predecessors which may have\r\nexisted at the beginning of the Lower Laurentian, when the earliest\r\nsediments of that great formation were laid down. Vast unexplored areas\r\nof Laurentian and Huronian rocks exist in the Old World and the New.\r\nThe most ample facilities for microscopic examination of rocks may\r\nnow be obtained; and I could wish that one result of the publication\r\nof these pages may be to direct the attention of some of the younger\r\nand more active geologists to these fields of investigation. It is to\r\nbe observed also that such regions are among the richest in useful\r\nminerals, and there is no reason why search for these fossils should\r\nnot be connected with other and more practically useful researches. On\r\nthis subject it will not be out of place to quote the remarks which I\r\nmade in one of my earlier papers on the Laurentian fossils:--\r\n\r\n\"This subject opens up several interesting fields of chemical,\r\nphysiological, and geological inquiry. One of these relates to the\r\nconclusions stated by Dr. Hunt as to the probable existence of a\r\nlarge amount of carbonic acid in the Laurentian atmosphere, and of\r\nmuch carbonate of lime in the seas of that period, and the possible\r\nrelation of this to the abundance of certain low forms of plants and\r\nanimals. Another is the comparison already instituted by Professor\r\nHuxley and Dr. Carpenter, between the conditions of the Laurentian and\r\nthose of the deeper parts of the modern ocean. Another is the possible\r\noccurrence of other forms of animal life than Eozoon and Annelids,\r\nwhich I have stated in my paper of 1864, after extensive microscopic\r\nstudy of the Laurentian limestones, to be indicated by the occurrence\r\nof calcareous fragments, differing in structure from Eozoon, but at\r\npresent of unknown nature. Another is the effort to bridge over, by\r\nfurther discoveries similar to that of the _Eozoon Bavaricum_ of\r\nGümbel, the gap now existing between the life of the Lower Laurentian\r\nand that of the Primordial Silurian or Cambrian period. It is scarcely\r\ntoo much to say that these inquiries open up a new world of thought and\r\ninvestigation, and hold out the hope of bringing us into the presence\r\nof the actual origin of organic life on our planet, though this may\r\nperhaps be found to have been Prelaurentian. I would here take the\r\nopportunity of stating that, in proposing the name Eozoon for the\r\nfirst fossil of the Laurentian, and in suggesting for the period the\r\nname \"Eozoic,\" I have by no means desired to exclude the possibility\r\nof forms of life which may have been precursors of what is now to us\r\nthe dawn of organic existence. Should remains of still older organisms\r\nbe found in those rocks now known to us only by pebbles in the\r\nLaurentian, these names will at least serve to mark an important stage\r\nin geological investigation.\"\r\n\r\nBut what if the result of such investigations should be to produce\r\nmore sceptics, or to bring to light mineral structures so resembling\r\nEozoon as to throw doubt upon the whole of the results detailed in\r\nthese chapters? I can fancy that this might be the first consequence,\r\nmore especially if the investigations were in the hands of persons\r\nmore conversant with minerals than with fossils; but I see no reason\r\nto fear the ultimate results. In any case, no doubt, the value of the\r\nresearches hitherto made may be diminished. It is always the fate of\r\ndiscoverers in Natural Science, either to be followed by opponents who\r\ntemporarily or permanently impugn or destroy the value of their new\r\nfacts, or by other investigators who push on the knowledge of facts and\r\nprinciples so far beyond their standpoint that the original discoveries\r\nare cast into the shade. This is a fatality incident to the progress of\r\nscientific work, from which no man can be free; and in so far as such\r\nmatters are concerned, we must all be content to share the fate of the\r\nold fossils whose history we investigate, and, having served our day\r\nand generation to give place to others. If any part of our work should\r\nstand the fire of discussion let us be thankful. One thing at least is\r\ncertain, that such careful surveys as those in the Laurentian rocks\r\nof Canada which led to the discovery of Eozoon, and such microscopic\r\nexaminations as those by which it has been worked up and presented to\r\nthe public, cannot fail to yield good results of one kind or another.\r\nAlready the attention excited by the controversies about Eozoon, by\r\nattracting investigators to the study of various microscopic and\r\nimitative forms in rocks, has promoted the advancement of knowledge,\r\nand must do so still more. For my own part, though I am not content to\r\nbase all my reputation on such work as I have done with respect to this\r\nold fossil, I am willing at least to take the responsibility of the\r\nresults I have announced, whatever conclusions may be finally reached;\r\nand in the consciousness of an honest effort to extend the knowledge\r\nof nature, to look forward to a better fame than any that could result\r\nfrom the most successful and permanent vindication of every detail\r\nof our scientific discoveries, even if they could be pushed to a\r\npoint which no subsequent investigation in the same difficult line of\r\nresearch would be able to overpass.\r\n\r\nContenting myself with these general remarks, I shall, for the benefit\r\nof those who relish geological controversy, append to this chapter a\r\nsummary of the objections urged by the most active opponents of the\r\nanimal nature of Eozoon, with the replies that may be or have been\r\ngiven; and I now merely add (in fig. 49) a magnified camera tracing of\r\na portion of a lamina of Eozoon with its canals and tubuli, to show\r\nmore fully the nature of the structures in controversy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49. _Portion of a thin Transverse Slice of a Lamina\r\nof Eozoon, magnified, showing its structure, as traced with the camera._\r\n\r\n(_a._) Nummuline wall of under side. (_b._) Intermediate skeleton with\r\ncanals. (_a´._) Nummuline wall of upper side. The two lower figures\r\nshow the lower and upper sides more highly magnified. The specimen is\r\none in which the canals are unusually well seen.]\r\n\r\nIt may be well, however, to sum up the evidence as it has been\r\npresented by Sir W. E. Logan, Dr. Carpenter, Dr. Hunt, and the author,\r\nin a short and intelligible form; and I shall do so under a few brief\r\nheads, with some explanatory remarks:--\r\n\r\n1. The Lower Laurentian of Canada, a rock formation whose\r\ndistribution, age, and structure have been thoroughly worked out by\r\nthe Canadian Survey, is found to contain thick and widely distributed\r\nbeds of limestone, related to the other beds in the same way in which\r\nlimestones occur in the sediments of other geological formations. There\r\nalso occur in the same formation, graphite, iron ores, and metallic\r\nsulphides, in such relations as to suggest the idea that the limestones\r\nas well as these other minerals are of organic origin.\r\n\r\n2. In the limestones are found laminated bodies of definite form and\r\nstructure, composed of calcite alternating with serpentine and other\r\nminerals. The forms of these bodies suggested a resemblance to the\r\nSilurian Stromatoporæ, and the different mineral substances associated\r\nwith the calcite in the production of similar forms, showed that these\r\nwere not accidental or concretionary.\r\n\r\n3. On microscopic examination, it proved that the calcareous laminæ\r\nof these forms were similar in structure to the shells of modern\r\nand fossil Foraminifera, more especially those of the Rotaline and\r\nNummuline types, and that the finer structures, though usually filled\r\nwith serpentine and other hydrous silicates, were sometimes occupied\r\nwith calcite, pyroxene, or dolomite, showing that they must when recent\r\nhave been empty canals and tubes.\r\n\r\n4. The mode of filling thus suggested for the chambers and tubes of\r\nEozoon, is precisely that which takes place in modern Foraminifera\r\nfilled with glauconite, and in Palæozoic crinoids and corals filled\r\nwith other hydrous silicates.\r\n\r\n5. The type of growth and structure predicated of Eozoon from the\r\nobserved appearances, in its great size, its laminated and acervuline\r\nforms, and in its canal system and tubulation, are not only in\r\nconformity with those of other Foraminifera, but such as might be\r\nexpected in a very ancient form of that group.\r\n\r\n6. Indications exist of other organic bodies in the limestones\r\ncontaining Eozoon, and also of the Eozoon being preserved not only in\r\nreefs but in drifted fragmental beds as in the case of modern corals.\r\n\r\n7. Similar organic structures have been found in the Laurentian\r\nlimestones of Massachusetts and New York, and also in those of various\r\nparts of Europe, and Dr. Gümbel has found an additional species in\r\nrocks succeeding the Laurentian in age.\r\n\r\n8. The manner in which the structures of Eozoon are affected by the\r\nfaulting, development of crystals, mineral veins, and other effects of\r\ndisturbance and metamorphism in the containing rocks, is precisely that\r\nwhich might be expected on the supposition that it is of organic origin.\r\n\r\n9. The exertions of several active and able opponents have failed to\r\nshow how, otherwise than by organic agency, such structures as those\r\nof Eozoon can be formed, except on the supposition of pseudomorphism\r\nand replacement, which must be regarded as chemically extravagant, and\r\nwhich would equally impugn the validity of all fossils determined\r\nby microscopic structure. In like manner all comparisons of these\r\nstructures with dendritic and other imitative forms have signally\r\nfailed, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge.\r\n\r\nAnother and perhaps simpler way of putting the case is the\r\nfollowing:--Only three general modes of accounting for the existence\r\nof Eozoon have been proposed. The first is that of Professors King and\r\nRowney, who regard the chambers and canals filled with serpentine as\r\narising from the erosion or partial dissolving away of serpentine and\r\nits replacement by calcite. The objections to this are conclusive.\r\nIt does not explain the nummuline wall, which has to be separately\r\naccounted for by confounding it, contrary to the observed facts,\r\nwith the veins of fibrous serpentine which actually pass through\r\ncracks in the fossil. Such replacement is in the highest degree\r\nunlikely on chemical grounds, and there is no evidence of it in the\r\nnumerous serpentine grains, nodules, and bands in the Laurentian\r\nlimestones. On the other hand, the opposite replacement, that of\r\nlimestone by serpentine, seems to have occurred. The mechanical\r\ndifficulties in accounting for the delicate canals on this theory are\r\nalso insurmountable. Finally, it does not account for the specimens\r\npreserved in pyroxene and other silicates, and in dolomite and calcite.\r\nA second mode of accounting for the facts is that the Eozoon forms are\r\nmerely peculiar concretions. But this fails to account for their great\r\ndifference from the other serpentine concretions in the same beds, and\r\nfor their regularity of plan and the delicacy of their structure, and\r\nalso for minerals of different kinds entering into their composition,\r\nand still presenting precisely the same forms and structures. The only\r\nremaining theory is that of the filling of cavities by infiltration\r\nwith serpentine. This accords with the fact that such infiltration by\r\nminerals akin to serpentine exists in fossils in later rocks. It also\r\naccords with the known aqueous origin of the serpentine nodules and\r\nbands, the veins of fibrous serpentine, and the other minerals found\r\nfilling the cavities of Eozoon. Even the pyroxene has been shown by\r\nHunt to exist in the Laurentian in veins of aqueous origin. The only\r\ndifficulty existing on this view is how a calcite skeleton with such\r\nchambers, canals, and tubuli could be formed; and this is solved by the\r\ndiscovery that all these facts correspond precisely with those to be\r\nfound in the shells of modern oceanic Foraminifera. The existence then\r\nof Eozoon, its structure, and its relations to the containing rocks and\r\nminerals being admitted, no rational explanation of its origin seems at\r\npresent possible other than that advocated in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will now turn to Plate VIII., page 207, he will find some\r\ninteresting illustrations of several very important facts bearing on\r\nthe above arguments. Fig. 1 represents a portion of a very thin slice\r\nof a specimen traversed by veins of fibrous serpentine or chrysotile,\r\nand having the calcite of the walls more broken by cleavage planes\r\nthan usual. The portion selected shows a part of one of the chambers\r\nfilled with serpentine, which presents the usual curdled aspect\r\nalmost impossible to represent in a drawing (_s_). It is traversed\r\nby a branching vein of chrysotile (_s_´), which, where cut precisely\r\nparallel to its fibres, shows clear fine cross lines, indicating the\r\nsides of its constituent prisms, and where the plane of section has\r\npassed obliquely to its fibres, has a curiously stippled or frowsy\r\nappearance. On either side of the serpentine band is the nummuline\r\nor proper wall, showing under a low power a milky appearance, which,\r\nwith a higher power, becomes resolved into a tissue of the most\r\nbeautiful parallel threads, representing the filling of its tubuli.\r\nNothing can be more distinct than the appearances presented by this\r\nwall and the chrysotile vein, under every variety of magnifying power\r\nand illumination; and all who have had an opportunity of examining my\r\nspecimens have expressed astonishment that appearances so dissimilar\r\nshould have been confounded with each other. On the lower side two\r\nindentations are seen in the proper wall (_c_). These are connected\r\nwith the openings into small subordinate chamberlets, one of which is\r\nin part included in the thickness of the slice. At the upper and lower\r\nparts of the figure are seen portions of the intermediate skeleton\r\ntraversed by canals, which in the lower part are very large, though\r\nfrom the analogy of other specimens it is probable that they have in\r\ntheir interstices minute canaliculi not visible in this slice. Fig.\r\n2, from the same specimen, shows the termination of one of the canals\r\nagainst the proper wall, its end expanding into a wide disc of sarcode\r\non the surface of the wall, as may be seen in similar structures in\r\nmodern Foraminifera. In this specimen the canals are beautifully smooth\r\nand cylindrical, but they sometimes present a knotted or jointed\r\nappearance, especially in specimens decalcified by acids, in which\r\nperhaps some erosion has taken place. They are also occasionally\r\nfringed with minute crystals, especially in those specimens in which\r\nthe calcite has been partially replaced with other minerals. Fig. 3\r\nshows an example of faulting of the proper wall, an appearance not\r\ninfrequently observed; and it also shows a vein chrysotile crossing the\r\nline of fault, and not itself affected by it--a clear evidence of its\r\nposterior origin. Figs. 4 and 5 are examples of specimens having the\r\ncanals filled with dolomite, and showing extremely fine canals in the\r\ninterstices of the others: an appearance observed only in the thicker\r\nparts of the skeleton, and when these are very well preserved. These\r\ndolomitized portions require some precautions for their observation,\r\neither in slices or decalcified specimens, but when properly managed\r\nthey show the structures in very great perfection. The specimen in fig.\r\n5 is from an abnormally thick portion of intermediate skeleton, having\r\nunusually thick canals, and referred to in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nOne object which I have in view in thus minutely directing attention\r\nto these illustrations, is to show the nature of the misapprehensions\r\nwhich may occur in examining specimens of this kind, and at the same\r\ntime the certainty which may be attained when proper precautions are\r\ntaken. I may add that such structures as those referred to are best\r\nseen in extremely thin slices, and that the observer must not expect\r\nthat every specimen will exhibit them equally well. It is only by\r\npreparing and examining many specimens that the best results can be\r\nobtained. It often happens that one specimen is required to show well\r\none part of the structures, and a different one to show another; and\r\nprevious to actual trial, it is not easy to say which portion of\r\nthe structures any particular fragment will show most clearly. This\r\nrenders it somewhat difficult to supply one's friends with specimens.\r\nReally good slices can be prepared only from the best material and by\r\nskilled manipulators; imperfect slices may only mislead; and rough\r\nspecimens may not be properly prepared by persons unaccustomed to the\r\nwork, or if so prepared may not turn out satisfactory, or may not be\r\nskilfully examined. These difficulties, however, Eozoon shares with\r\nother specimens in micro-geology, and I have experienced similar\r\ndisappointments in the case of fossil wood.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion of this part of the subject, and referring to the notes\r\nappended to this chapter for further details, I would express the hope\r\nthat those who have hitherto opposed the interpretation of Eozoon as\r\norganic, and to whose ability and honesty of purpose I willingly bear\r\ntestimony, will find themselves enabled to acknowledge at least the\r\nreasonable probability of that interpretation of these remarkable forms\r\nand structures.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n(A.) Objections of Profs. King and Rowney.\r\n\r\n_Trans. Royal Irish Academy, July, 1869._[AO]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AO: Reprinted in the _Annals and Magazine of Natural\r\nHistory_, May, 1874.]\r\n\r\n  The following summary, given by these authors, may be taken as\r\n  including the substance of their objections to the animal nature of\r\n  Eozoon. I shall give them in their words and follow them with short\r\n  answers to each.\r\n\r\n  \"1st. The serpentine in ophitic rocks has been shown to present\r\n  appearances which can only be explained on the view that it undergoes\r\n  structural and chemical changes, causing it to pass into variously\r\n  subdivided states, and etching out the resulting portions into a\r\n  variety of forms--grains and plates, with lobulated or segmented\r\n  surfaces--fibres and aciculi--simple and branching configurations.\r\n  Crystals of malacolite, often associated with the serpentine,\r\n  manifest some of these changes in a remarkable degree.\r\n\r\n  \"2nd. The 'intermediate skeleton' of Eozoon (which we hold to be\r\n  the calcareous matrix of the above lobulated grains, etc.) is\r\n  completely paralleled in various crystalline rocks--notably marble\r\n  containing grains of coccolite (Aker and Tyree), pargasite (Finland),\r\n  chondrodite (New Jersey, etc.)\r\n\r\n  \"3rd. The 'chamber casts' in the acervuline variety of Eozoon are\r\n  more or less paralleled by the grains of the mineral silicates in the\r\n  pre-cited marbles.\r\n\r\n  \"4th. The 'chamber casts' being composed occasionally of loganite and\r\n  malacolite, besides serpentine, is a fact which, instead of favouring\r\n  their organic origin, as supposed, must be held as a proof of their\r\n  having been produced by mineral agencies; inasmuch as these three\r\n  silicates have a close pseudomorphic relationship, and may therefore\r\n  replace one another in their naturally prescribed order.\r\n\r\n  \"5th. Dr. Gümbel, observing rounded, cylindrical, or tuberculated\r\n  grains of coccolite and pargasite in crystalline calcareous marbles,\r\n  considered them to be 'chamber casts,' or of organic origin. We have\r\n  shown that such grains often present crystalline planes, angles, and\r\n  edges; a fact clearly proving that they were originally simple or\r\n  compound crystals that have undergone external decretion by chemical\r\n  or solvent action.\r\n\r\n  \"6th. We have adduced evidences to show that the 'nummuline layer' in\r\n  its typical condition--that is, consisting of cylindrical aciculi,\r\n  separated by interspaces filled with calcite--has originated directly\r\n  from closely packed fibres; these from chrysotile or asbestiform\r\n  serpentine; this from incipiently fibrous serpentine; and the latter\r\n  from the same mineral in its amorphous or structureless condition.\r\n\r\n  \"7th. The 'nummuline layer,' in its typical condition, unmistakably\r\n  occurs in cracks or fissures, both in Canadian and Connemara ophite.\r\n\r\n  \"8th. The 'nummuline layer' is paralleled by the fibrous coat which\r\n  is occasionally present on the surface of grains of chondrodite.\r\n\r\n  \"9th. We have shown that the relative position of two superposed\r\n  asbestiform layers (an _upper_ and an _under_ 'proper wall'), and the\r\n  admitted fact of their component aciculi often passing continuously\r\n  and without interruption from one 'chamber cast' to another, to the\r\n  exclusion of the 'intermediate skeleton,' are totally incompatible\r\n  with the idea of the 'nummuline layer' having resulted from\r\n  pseudopodial tubulation.\r\n\r\n  \"10th. The so-called 'stolons' and 'passages of communication\r\n  exactly corresponding with those described in _Cycloclypeus_,'\r\n  have been shown to be tabular crystals and variously formed bodies,\r\n  belonging to different minerals, wedged crossways or obliquely in the\r\n  calcareous interspaces between the grains and plates of serpentine.\r\n\r\n  \"11th. The 'canal system' is composed of serpentine, or malacolite.\r\n  Its typical kinds in the first of these minerals may be traced in\r\n  all stages of formation out of plates, prisms, and other solids,\r\n  undergoing a process of superficial decretion. Those in malacolite\r\n  are made up of crystals--single, or aggregated together--that have\r\n  had their planes, angles, and edges rounded off; or have become\r\n  further reduced by some solvent.\r\n\r\n  \"12th. The 'canal system' in its remarkable branching varieties is\r\n  completely paralleled by crystalline configurations in the coccolite\r\n  marble of Aker, in Sweden; and in the crevices of a crystal of spinel\r\n  imbedded in a calcitic matrix from Amity, New York.\r\n\r\n  \"13th. The _configurations_, presumed to represent the 'canal\r\n  systems,' are _totally without any regularity_ of form, of relative\r\n  size, or of arrangement; and they occur independently of and apart\r\n  from other 'eozoonal features' (Amity, Boden, etc.); facts not only\r\n  demonstrating them to be purely mineral products, but which strike at\r\n  the root of the idea that they are of organic origin.\r\n\r\n  \"14th. In answer to the argument that as all the foregoing 'eozoonal\r\n  features' are occasionally found together in ophite, the combination\r\n  must be considered a conclusive evidence of their organic origin,\r\n  we have shown, from the composition, physical characters, and\r\n  circumstances of occurrence and association of their component\r\n  serpentine, that they represent the structural and chemical changes\r\n  which are eminently and peculiarly characteristic of this mineral.\r\n  It has also been shown that the combination is paralleled to a\r\n  remarkable extent in chondrodite and its calcitic matrix.\r\n\r\n  \"15th. The 'regular alternation of lamellæ of calcareous and\r\n  silicious minerals' (respectively representing the 'intermediate\r\n  skeleton' and 'chamber casts') occasionally seen in ophite, and\r\n  considered to be a 'fundamental fact' evidencing an organic\r\n  arrangement, is proved to be a _mineralogical_ phenomenon by the\r\n  fact that a similar alternation occurs in amphiboline-calcitic\r\n  marbles, and gneissose rocks.\r\n\r\n  \"16th. In order to account for certain _untoward_ difficulties\r\n  presented by the configurations forming the 'canal system,' and\r\n  the aciculi of the 'nummuline layer'--that is, when they occur as\r\n  '_solid bundles_'--or are '_closely packed_'--or '_appear to be\r\n  glued together_'--Dr. Carpenter has proposed the theory that the\r\n  sarcodic extensions which they are presumed to represent have been\r\n  'turned into stone' (a 'silicious mineral') 'by Nature's cunning'\r\n  ('just as the sarcodic layer on the surface of the shell of living\r\n  Foraminifers is formed by the spreading out of _coalesced_ bundles\r\n  of the pseudopodia that have emerged from the chamber wall')--'by\r\n  a process of chemical substitution _before_ their destruction by\r\n  ordinary decomposition.' We showed this quasi-alchymical theory to be\r\n  altogether unscientific.\r\n\r\n  \"17th. The 'silicious mineral' (serpentine) has been analogued with\r\n  those forming the variously-formed casts (in 'glauconite,' etc.)\r\n  of recent and fossil Foraminifers. We have shown that the mineral\r\n  silicates of Eozoon have no relation whatever to the substances\r\n  composing such casts.\r\n\r\n  \"18th. Dr. Hunt, in order to account for the serpentine, loganite,\r\n  and malacolite, being the presumed in-filling substances of Eozoon,\r\n  has conceived the 'novel doctrine,' that such minerals were\r\n  _directly_ deposited in the ocean waters in which this 'fossil'\r\n  lived. We have gone over all his evidences and arguments without\r\n  finding _one_ to be substantiated.\r\n\r\n  \"19th. Having investigated the alleged cases of 'chambers' and\r\n  'tubes' occurring 'filled with calcite,' and presumed to be 'a\r\n  conclusive answer to' our 'objections,' we have shown that there are\r\n  the strongest grounds for removing them from the category of reliable\r\n  evidences on the side of the organic doctrine. The Tudor specimen has\r\n  been shown to be equally unavailable.\r\n\r\n  \"20th. The occurrence of the best preserved specimens of Eozoon\r\n  Canadense in rocks that are in a '_highly crystalline condition_'\r\n  (Dawson) must be accepted as a fact utterly fatal to its organic\r\n  origin.\r\n\r\n  \"21st. The occurrence of 'eozoonal features' _solely_ in crystalline\r\n  or metamorphosed rocks, belonging to the Laurentian, the Lower\r\n  Silurian, and the Liassic systems--never in ordinary unaltered\r\n  deposits of these and the intermediate systems--must be assumed as\r\n  completely demonstrating their purely mineral origin.\"\r\n\r\n  The answers already given to these objections may be summed up\r\n  severally as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1st. This is a mere hypothesis to account for the forms presented by\r\n  serpentine grains and by Eozoon. Hunt has shown that it is untenable\r\n  chemically, and has completely exploded it in his recent papers on\r\n  Chemistry and Geology.[AP] My own observations show that it does not\r\n  accord with the mode of occurrence of serpentine in the Laurentian\r\n  limestones of Canada.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AP: Boston, 1874.]\r\n\r\n  2nd. Some of the things stated to parallel the intermediate skeleton\r\n  of Eozoon, are probably themselves examples of that skeleton. Others\r\n  have been shown to have no resemblance to it.\r\n\r\n  3rd. The words \"more or less\" indicate the precise value of this\r\n  statement, in a question of comparison between mineral and organic\r\n  structures. So the prismatic structure of satin-spar may be said\r\n  \"more or less\" to resemble that of a shell, or of the cells of a\r\n  Stenopora.\r\n\r\n  4th. This overlooks the filling of chamber casts with pyroxene,\r\n  dolomite, or limestone. Even in the case of loganite this objection\r\n  is of no value unless it can be applied equally to the similar\r\n  silicates which fill cavities of fossils[AQ] in the Silurian\r\n  limestones and in the green-sand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AQ: See for a full discussion of this subject Dr. Hunt's\r\n\"Papers\" above referred to.]\r\n\r\n  5th. Dr. Gümbel's observations are those of a highly skilled and\r\n  accurate observer. Even if crystalline forms appear in \"chamber\r\n  casts,\" this is as likely to be a result of the injury of organic\r\n  structures by crystallization, as of the partial effacement of\r\n  crystals by other actions. Crystalline faces occur abundantly in many\r\n  undoubted fossil woods and corals; and crystals not unfrequently\r\n  cross and interfere with the structures in such specimens.\r\n\r\n  6th. On the contrary, the Canadian specimens prove clearly that the\r\n  veins of chrysotile have been filled subsequently to the existence of\r\n  Eozoon in its present state, and that there is no connection whatever\r\n  between them and the Nummuline wall.\r\n\r\n  7th. This I have never seen in all my examinations of Eozoon. The\r\n  writers must have mistaken veins of fibrous serpentine for the\r\n  nummuline wall.\r\n\r\n  8th. Only if such grains of chondrodite are themselves casts of\r\n  foraminiferal chambers. But Messrs. King and Rowney have repeatedly\r\n  figured mere groups of crystals as examples of the nummuline wall.\r\n\r\n  9th. Dr. Carpenter has shown that this objection depends on a\r\n  misconception of the structure of modern Foraminifera, which show\r\n  similar appearances.\r\n\r\n  10th. That disseminated crystals occur in the Eozoon limestones is a\r\n  familiar fact, and one paralleled in many other more or less altered\r\n  organic limestones. Foreign bodies also occur in the chambers filled\r\n  with loganite and other minerals; but these need not any more be\r\n  confounded with the pillars and walls connecting the laminæ than\r\n  the sand filling a dead coral with its lamellæ. Further, it is well\r\n  known that foreign bodies are often contained both in the testa and\r\n  chambers even of recent Foraminifera.\r\n\r\n  11th. The canal system is not always filled with serpentine or\r\n  malacolite; and when filled with pyroxene, dolomite, or calcite, the\r\n  forms are the same. The irregularities spoken of are perhaps more\r\n  manifest in the serpentine specimens, because this mineral has in\r\n  places encroached on or partially replaced the calcite walls.\r\n\r\n  12th. If this is true of the Aker marble, then it must contain\r\n  Eozoon; and specimens of the Amity limestone which I have examined,\r\n  certainly contain large fragments of Eozoon.\r\n\r\n  13th. The configuration of the canal system is quite definite,\r\n  though varying in coarseness and fineness. It is not known to occur\r\n  independently of the forms of Eozoon except in fragmental deposits.\r\n\r\n  14th. The argument is not that they are \"occasionally found together\r\n  in ophite,\" but that they are found together in specimens preserved\r\n  by different minerals, and in such a way as to show that all these\r\n  minerals have filled chambers, canals, and tubuli, previously\r\n  existing in a skeleton of limestone.\r\n\r\n  15th. The lamination of Eozoon is not like that of any rock, but\r\n  a strictly limited and definite form, comparable with that of\r\n  Stromatopora.\r\n\r\n  16th. This I pass over, as a mere captious criticism of modes of\r\n  expression used by Dr. Carpenter.\r\n\r\n  17th. Dr. Hunt, whose knowledge of chemical geology should give\r\n  the greatest weight to his judgment, maintains the deposition of\r\n  serpentine and loganite to have taken place in a manner similar to\r\n  that of jollyte and glauconite in undoubted fossils: and this would\r\n  seem to be a clear deduction from the facts he has stated, and from\r\n  the chemical character of the substances. My own observations of the\r\n  mode of occurrence of serpentine in the Eozoon limestones lead me to\r\n  the same result.\r\n\r\n  18th. Dr. Hunt's arguments on the subject, as recently presented\r\n  in his _Papers on Chemistry and Geology_, need only be studied by\r\n  any candid and competent chemist or mineralogist to lead to a very\r\n  different conclusion from that of the objectors.\r\n\r\n  19th. This is a mere statement of opinion. The fact remains that the\r\n  chambers and canals are sometimes filled with calcite.\r\n\r\n  20th. That the occurrence of Eozoon in crystalline limestones is\r\n  \"utterly fatal\" to its claims to organic origin can be held only by\r\n  those who are utterly ignorant of the frequency with which organic\r\n  remains are preserved in highly crystalline limestones of all ages.\r\n  In addition to other examples mentioned above, I may state that the\r\n  curious specimen of Cœnostroma from the Guelph limestone figured\r\n  in Chapter VI., has been converted into a perfectly crystalline\r\n  dolomite, while its canals and cavities have been filled with\r\n  calcite, since weathered out.\r\n\r\n  21st. This limited occurrence is an assumption contrary to facts.\r\n  It leaves out of account the Tudor specimens, and also the abundant\r\n  occurrence of the Stromatoporoid successors of Eozoon in the\r\n  Silurian and Devonian. Further, even if the Eozoon were limited to\r\n  the Laurentian, this would not be remarkable; and since all the\r\n  Laurentian rocks known to us are more or less altered, it could not\r\n  in that case occur in unaltered rocks.\r\n\r\n  I have gone over these objections seriatim, because, though\r\n  individually weak, they have an imposing appearance in the aggregate,\r\n  and have been paraded as a conclusive settlement of the questions\r\n  at issue. They have even been reprinted in the year just past in an\r\n  English journal of some standing, which professes to accept only\r\n  original contributions to science, but has deviated from its rule in\r\n  their favour. I may be excused for adding a portion of my original\r\n  argument in opposition to these objections, as given more at length\r\n  in the _Transactions of the Irish Academy_.\r\n\r\n  1. I object to the authors' mode of stating the question at issue,\r\n  whereby they convey to the reader the impression that this is merely\r\n  to account for the occurrence of certain peculiar forms in ophite.\r\n\r\n  With reference to this, it is to be observed that the attention of\r\n  Sir William Logan, and of the writer, was first called to Eozoon\r\n  by the occurrence in Laurentian rocks of definite forms resembling\r\n  the Silurian _Stromatoporæ_, and dissimilar from any concretions or\r\n  crystalline structures found in these rocks. With his usual sagacity,\r\n  Sir William added to these facts the consideration that the mineral\r\n  substances occurring is these forms were so dissimilar as to suggest\r\n  that the forms themselves must be due to some extraneous cause rather\r\n  than to any crystalline or segregative tendency of their constituent\r\n  minerals. These specimens, which were exhibited by Sir William as\r\n  probably fossils, at the meeting of the American Association in\r\n  1859, and noticed with figures in the Report of the Canadian Survey\r\n  for 1863, showed under the microscope no minute structures. The\r\n  writer, who had at the time an opportunity of examining them, stated\r\n  his belief that if fossils, they would prove to be not Corals but\r\n  Protozoa.\r\n\r\n  In 1864, additional specimens having been obtained by the Survey,\r\n  slices were submitted to the writer, in which he at once detected\r\n  a well-marked canal-system, and stated, decidedly, his belief that\r\n  the forms were organic and foraminiferal. The announcement of this\r\n  discovery was first made by Sir W. E. Logan, in _Silliman's Journal_\r\n  for 1864. So far, the facts obtained and stated related to definite\r\n  forms mineralised by loganite, serpentine, pyroxene, dolomite, and\r\n  calcite. But before publishing these facts in detail, extensive\r\n  series of sections of all the Laurentian limestones, and of those\r\n  of the altered Quebec group of the Green Mountain range, were made,\r\n  under the direction of Sir W. E. Logan and Dr. Hunt, and examined\r\n  microscopically. Specimens were also decalcified by acids, and\r\n  subjected to chemical examination by Dr. Sterry Hunt. The result was\r\n  the conviction that the definite laminated forms must be organic,\r\n  and further, that there exist in the Laurentian limestones fragments\r\n  of such forms retaining their structure, and also other fragments,\r\n  probably organic, but distinct from Eozoon. These conclusions were\r\n  submitted to the Geological Society of London, in 1864, after the\r\n  specimens on which they were based had been shown to Dr. Carpenter\r\n  and Professor T. R. Jones, the former of whom detected in some of\r\n  the specimens an additional foraminiferal structure--that of the\r\n  tubulation of the proper wall, which I had not been able to make out.\r\n  Subsequently, in rocks at Tudor, of somewhat later age than those\r\n  of the Lower Laurentian at Grenville, similar structures were found\r\n  in limestones not more metamorphic than many of those which retain\r\n  fossils in the Silurian system. I make this historical statement in\r\n  order to place the question in its true light, and to show that it\r\n  relates to the organic origin of certain definite mineral masses,\r\n  exhibiting, not only the external forms of fossils, but also their\r\n  internal structure.\r\n\r\n  In opposition to these facts, and to the careful deductions drawn\r\n  from them, the authors of the paper under consideration maintain that\r\n  the structures are mineral and crystalline. I believe that in the\r\n  present state of science such an attempt to return to the doctrine\r\n  of \"plastic-force\" as a mode of accounting for fossils would not\r\n  be tolerated for a moment, were it not for the great antiquity and\r\n  highly crystalline condition of the rocks in which the structures\r\n  are found, which naturally create a prejudice against the idea of\r\n  their being fossiliferous. That the authors themselves feel this is\r\n  apparent from the slight manner in which they state the leading facts\r\n  above given, and from their evident anxiety to restrict the question\r\n  to the mode of occurrence of serpentine in limestone, and to ignore\r\n  the specimens of Eozoon preserved under different mineral conditions.\r\n\r\n  2. With reference to the general form of Eozoon and its structure\r\n  on the large scale, I would call attention to two admissions of\r\n  the authors of the paper, which appear to me to be fatal to their\r\n  case:--First, they admit, at page 533 [_Proceedings_, vol. x.],\r\n  their \"inability to explain satisfactorily\" the alternating layers\r\n  of carbonate of lime and other minerals in the typical specimens of\r\n  Canadian Eozoon. They make a feeble attempt to establish an analogy\r\n  between this and certain concentric concretionary layers; but the\r\n  cases are clearly not parallel, and the laminæ of the Canadian\r\n  Eozoon present connecting plates and columns not explicable on any\r\n  concretionary hypothesis. If, however, they are unable to explain the\r\n  lamellar structure alone, as it appeared to Logan in 1859, is it not\r\n  rash to attempt to explain it away now, when certain minute internal\r\n  structures, corresponding to what might have been expected on the\r\n  hypothesis of its organic origin, are added to it? If I affirm that\r\n  a certain mass is the trunk of a fossil tree, and another asserts\r\n  that it is a concretion, but professes to be unable to account for\r\n  its form and its rings of growth, surely his case becomes very weak\r\n  after I have made a slice of it, and have shown that it retains the\r\n  structure of wood.\r\n\r\n  Next, they appear to admit that if specimens occur wholly composed\r\n  of carbonate of lime, their theory will fall to the ground. Now such\r\n  specimens do exist. They treat the Tudor specimen with scepticism as\r\n  probably \"strings of segregated calcite.\" Since the account of that\r\n  specimen was published, additional fragments have been collected, so\r\n  that new slices have been prepared. I have examined these with care,\r\n  and am prepared to affirm that the chambers in these specimens are\r\n  filled with a dark-coloured limestone not more crystalline than is\r\n  usual in the Silurian rocks, and that the chamber walls are composed\r\n  of carbonate of lime, with the canals filled with the same material,\r\n  except where the limestone filling the chambers has penetrated into\r\n  parts of the larger ones. I should add that the stratigraphical\r\n  researches of Mr. Vennor, of the Canadian Survey, have rendered it\r\n  probable that the beds containing these fossils, though unconformably\r\n  underlying the Lower Silurian, overlie the Lower Laurentian of the\r\n  locality, and are, therefore, probably Upper Laurentian, or perhaps\r\n  Huronian, so that the Tudor specimens may approach in age to Gümbel's\r\n  Eozoon Bavaricum.[AR]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AR: I may now refer in addition to the canals filled with\r\ncalcite and dolomite, detected by Dr. Carpenter and myself in specimens\r\nfrom Petite Nation, and mentioned in a previous chapter. See also Plate\r\nVIII.]\r\n\r\n  Further, the authors of the paper have no right to object to our\r\n  regarding the laminated specimen as \"typical\" Eozoon. If the question\r\n  were as to _typical ophite_ the case would be different; but the\r\n  question actually is as to certain well-defined forms which we regard\r\n  as fossils, and allege to have organic structure on the small scale,\r\n  as well as lamination on the large scale. We profess to account for\r\n  the acervuline forms by the irregular growth at the surface of the\r\n  organisms, and by the breaking of them into fragments confusedly\r\n  intermingled in great thicknesses of limestone, just as fragments of\r\n  corals occur in Palæozoic limestones; but we are under no obligation\r\n  to accept irregular or disintegrated specimens as typical; and when\r\n  objectors reason from these fragments, we have a right to point to\r\n  the more perfect examples. It would be easy to explain the loose\r\n  cells of _Tetradium_ which characterize the bird's-eye limestone\r\n  of the Lower Silurian of America, as crystalline structures; but\r\n  a comparison with the unbroken masses of the same coral, shows\r\n  their true nature. I have for some time made the minute structure\r\n  of Palæozoic limestones a special study, and have described some\r\n  of them from the Silurian formations of Canada.[AS] I possess now\r\n  many additional examples, showing fragments of various kinds of\r\n  fossils preserved in these limestones, and recognisable only by the\r\n  infiltration of their pores with different silicious minerals. It can\r\n  also be shown that in many cases the crystallization of the carbonate\r\n  of lime, both of the fossils themselves and of their matrix, has\r\n  not interfered with the perfection of the most minute of these\r\n  structures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AS: In the _Canadian Naturalist_.]\r\n\r\n  The fact that the chambers are usually filled with silicates is\r\n  strangely regarded by the authors as an argument against the organic\r\n  nature of Eozoon. One would think that the extreme frequency of\r\n  silicious fillings of the cavities of fossils, and even of silicious\r\n  replacement of their tissues, should have prevented the use of such\r\n  an argument, without taking into account the opposite conclusions to\r\n  be drawn from the various kinds of silicates found in the specimens,\r\n  and from the modern filling of Foraminifera by hydrous silicates, as\r\n  shown by Ehrenberg, Mantell, Carpenter, Bailey, and Pourtales.[AT]\r\n  Further, I have elsewhere shown that the loganite is proved by its\r\n  texture to have been a fragmental substance, or at least filled\r\n  with loose _debris_; that the Tudor specimens have the cavities\r\n  filled with a sedimentary limestone, and that several fragmental\r\n  specimens from Madoc are actually wholly calcareous. It is to be\r\n  observed, however, that the wholly calcareous specimens present\r\n  great difficulties to an observer; and I have no doubt that they are\r\n  usually overlooked by collectors in consequence of their not being\r\n  developed by weathering, or showing any obvious structure in fresh\r\n  fractures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AT: _Quarterly Journal Geol. Society_, 1864.]\r\n\r\n  3. With regard to the canal system, the authors persist in\r\n  confusing the casts of it which occur in serpentine with \"metaxite\"\r\n  concretions, and in likening them to dendritic crystallizations of\r\n  silver, etc., and coralloidal forms of carbonate of lime. In answer\r\n  to this, I think it quite sufficient to say that I fail to perceive\r\n  the resemblance as other than very imperfectly imitative. I may add,\r\n  that the case is one of the occurrence of a canal structure in forms\r\n  which on other grounds appear to be organic, while the concretionary\r\n  forms referred to are produced under diverse conditions, none of\r\n  them similar to those of which evidence appears in the specimens of\r\n  Eozoon. With the singular theory of pseudomorphism, by means of which\r\n  the authors now supplement their previous objections, I leave Dr.\r\n  Hunt to deal.\r\n\r\n  4. With respect to the proper wall and its minute tubulation, the\r\n  essential error of the authors consists in confounding it with\r\n  fibrous and acicular crystals, and in maintaining that because the\r\n  tubuli are sometimes apparently confused and confluent they must\r\n  be inorganic. With regard to the first of these positions, I may\r\n  repeat what I have stated in former papers--that the true cell-wall\r\n  presents minute cylindrical processes traversing carbonate of lime,\r\n  and usually nearly parallel to each other, and often slightly\r\n  bulbose at the extremity. Fibrous serpentine, on the other hand,\r\n  appears as angular crystals, closely packed together, while the\r\n  numerous spicular crystals of silicious minerals which often appear\r\n  in metamorphic limestones, and may be developed by decalcification,\r\n  appear as sharp angular needles usually radiating from centres or\r\n  irregularly disposed. Their own plate (Ophite from Skye, King and\r\n  Rowney's Paper, _Proc. R. I. A._, vol. x.), is an eminent example\r\n  of this; and whatever the nature of the crystals represented, they\r\n  have no appearance of being true tubuli of Eozoon. I have very often\r\n  shown microscopists and geologists the cell-wall along with veins of\r\n  chrysotile and coatings of acicular crystals occurring in the same or\r\n  similar limestones, and they have never failed at once to recognise\r\n  the difference, especially under high powers.\r\n\r\n  I do not deny that the tubulation is often imperfectly preserved,\r\n  and that in such cases the casts of the tubuli may appear to be\r\n  glued together by concretions of mineral matter, or to be broken\r\n  or imperfect. But this occurs in all fossils, and is familiar to\r\n  any microscopist examining them. How difficult is it in many cases\r\n  to detect the minute structure of Nummulites and other fossil\r\n  Foraminifera? How often does a specimen of fossil wood present in one\r\n  part distorted and confused fibres or mere crystals, with the remains\r\n  of the wood forming phragmata between them, when in other parts it\r\n  may show the most minute structures in perfect preservation? But\r\n  who would use the disintegrated portions to invalidate the evidence\r\n  of the parts better preserved? Yet this is precisely the argument\r\n  of Professors King and Rowney, and which they have not hesitated\r\n  in using in the case of a fossil so old as Eozoon, and so often\r\n  compressed, crushed, and partly destroyed by mineralization.\r\n\r\n  I have in the above remarks confined myself to what I regard as\r\n  absolutely essential by way of explanation and defence of the\r\n  organic nature of Eozoon. It would be unprofitable to enter into the\r\n  multitude of subordinate points raised by the authors, and their\r\n  theory of mineral pseudomorphism is discussed by my friend Dr. Hunt;\r\n  but I must say here that this theory ought, in my opinion, to afford\r\n  to any chemist a strong presumption against the validity of their\r\n  objections, especially since it confessedly does not account for all\r\n  the facts, while requiring a most complicated series of unproved and\r\n  improbable suppositions.\r\n\r\n  The only other new features in the communication to which this note\r\n  refers are contained in the \"supplementary note.\" The first of\r\n  these relates to the grains of coccolite in the limestone of Aker,\r\n  in Sweden. Whether or not these are organic, they are apparently\r\n  different from _Eozoon Canadense_. They, no doubt, resemble the\r\n  grains referred to by Gümbel as possibly organic, and also similar\r\n  granular objects with projections which, in a previous paper, I have\r\n  described from Laurentian limestones in Canada. These objects are of\r\n  doubtful nature; but if organic, they are distinct from Eozoon. The\r\n  second relates to the supposed crystals of malacolite from the same\r\n  place. Admitting the interpretation given of these to be correct,\r\n  they are no more related to Eozoon than are the curious vermicular\r\n  crystals of a micaceous mineral which I have noticed in the Canadian\r\n  limestones.\r\n\r\n  The third and still more remarkable case is that of a spinel from\r\n  Amity, New York, containing calcite in its crevices, including a\r\n  perfect canal system preserved in malacolite. With reference to\r\n  this, as spinels of large size occur in veins in the Laurentian\r\n  rocks, I am not prepared to say that it is absolutely impossible that\r\n  fragments of limestone containing Eozoon may not be occasionally\r\n  associated with them in their matrix. I confess, however, that\r\n  until I can examine such specimens, which I have not yet met with,\r\n  I cannot, after my experience of the tendencies of Messrs. Rowney\r\n  and King to confound other forms with those of Eozoon, accept their\r\n  determinations in a matter so critical and in a case so unlikely.[AU]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AU: I have since ascertained that Laurentian limestone found\r\nat Amity, New York, and containing spinels, does hold fragments of the\r\nintermediate skeleton of Eozoon. The limestone may have been originally\r\na mass of fragments of this kind with the aluminous and magnesian\r\nmaterial of the spinel in their interstices.]\r\n\r\n  If all specimens of Eozoon were of the acervuline character, the\r\n  comparison of the chamber-casts with concretionary granules might\r\n  have some plausibility. But it is to be observed that the laminated\r\n  arrangement is the typical one; and the study of the larger\r\n  specimens, cut under the direction of Sir W. E. Logan, shows that\r\n  these laminated forms must have grown on certain strata-planes before\r\n  the deposition of the overlying beds, and that the beds are, in part,\r\n  composed of the broken fragments of similar laminated structures.\r\n  Further, much of the apparently acervuline Eozoon rock is composed\r\n  of such broken fragments, the interstices between which should not\r\n  be confounded with the chambers: while the fact that the serpentine\r\n  fills such interstices as well as the chambers shows that its\r\n  arrangement is not concretionary. Again, these chambers are filled in\r\n  different specimens with serpentine, pyroxene, loganite, calcareous\r\n  spar, chondrodite, or even with arenaceous limestone. It is also to\r\n  be observed that the examination of a number of limestones, other\r\n  than Canadian, by Messrs. King and Rowney, has obliged them to admit\r\n  that the laminated forms in combination with the canal-system are\r\n  \"essentially Canadian,\" and that the only instances of structures\r\n  clearly resembling the Canadian specimens are afforded by limestones\r\n  Laurentian in age, and in some of which (as, for instance, in those\r\n  of Bavaria and Scandinavia) Carpenter and Gümbel have actually found\r\n  the structure of Eozoon. The other serpentine-limestones examined\r\n  (for example, that of Skye) are admitted to fail in essential points\r\n  of structure; and the only serpentine believed to be of eruptive\r\n  origin examined by them is confessedly destitute of all semblance\r\n  of Eozoon. Similar results have been attained by the more careful\r\n  researches of Prof. Gümbel, whose paper is well deserving of study by\r\n  all who have any doubts on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n(B.) Reply by Dr. Hunt to Chemical Objections--(_Ibid._).\r\n\r\n  \"In the _Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy_, for July 12,\r\n  1869, Messrs. King and Rowney have given us at length their latest\r\n  corrected views on various questions connected with Eozoon Canadense.\r\n  Leaving to my friend, Dr. Dawson, the discussion of the zoological\r\n  aspects of the question, I cannot forbear making a few criticisms\r\n  on the chemical and mineralogical views of the authors. The problem\r\n  which they had before them was to explain the occurrence of certain\r\n  forms which, to skilled observers, like Carpenter, Dawson, and\r\n  Rupert Jones, appear to possess all the structural character of the\r\n  calcareous skeleton of a foraminiferal organism, and moreover to\r\n  show how it happens that these forms of crystalline carbonate of\r\n  lime are associated with serpentine in such a way as to lead these\r\n  observers to conclude that this hydrous silicate of magnesia filled\r\n  and enveloped the calcareous skeleton, replacing the perishable\r\n  sarcode. The hypothesis now put forward by Messrs. King and Rowney\r\n  to explain the appearances in question, is, that all this curiously\r\n  arranged serpentine, which appears to be a cast of the interior of a\r\n  complex foraminiferal organism, has been shaped or sculptured out of\r\n  plates, prisms, and other solids of serpentine, by \"the erosion and\r\n  incomplete waste of the latter, _the definite shapes_ being residual\r\n  portions of the solid that have not completely disappeared.\" The\r\n  calcite which limits these definite shapes, or, in other words, what\r\n  is regarded as the calcareous skeleton of Eozoon, is a 'replacement\r\n  pseudomorph' of calcite taking the place of the wasted and eroded\r\n  serpentine. It was not a calcareous fossil, filled and surrounded\r\n  by the serpentine, but was formed in the midst of the serpentine\r\n  itself, by a mysterious agency which dissolved away this mineral to\r\n  form a mould, in which the calcite was cast. This marvellous process\r\n  can only be paralleled by the operations of that plastic force in\r\n  virtue of which sea-shells were supposed by some old naturalists\r\n  to be generated in the midst of rocky strata. Such equivocally\r\n  formed fossils, whether oysters or Foraminifers, may well be termed\r\n  _pseudomorphs_, but we are at a loss to see with what propriety the\r\n  authors of this singular hypothesis invoke the doctrines of mineral\r\n  pseudomorphism, as taught by Rose, Blum, Bischof, and Dana. In\r\n  replacement pseudomorphs, as understood by these authors, a mineral\r\n  species disappears and is replaced by another which retains the\r\n  external form of the first. Could it be shown that the calcite of the\r\n  cell-wall of Eozoon was once serpentine, this portion of carbonate\r\n  of lime would be a replacement pseudomorph after serpentine; but why\r\n  the portions of this mineral, which on the hypothesis of Messrs. King\r\n  and Rowney have been thus replaced, should assume the forms of a\r\n  foraminiferal skeleton, is precisely what our authors fail to show,\r\n  and, as all must see, is the gist of the whole matter.\r\n\r\n  \"Messrs. King and Rowney, it will be observed, assume the existence\r\n  of calcite as a replacement pseudomorph after serpentine, but give\r\n  no evidence of the possibility of such pseudomorphs. Both Rose and\r\n  Bischof regard serpentine itself as in all cases, of pseudomorphous\r\n  origin, and as the last result of the changes of a number of mineral\r\n  species, but give us no example of the pseudomorphous alteration of\r\n  serpentine itself. It is, according to Bischof, the very insolubility\r\n  and unalterability of serpentine which cause it to appear as the\r\n  final result of the change of so many mineral species. Delesse,\r\n  moreover, in his carefully prepared table of pseudomorphous minerals,\r\n  in which he has resumed the results of his own and all preceding\r\n  observers, does not admit the pseudomorphic replacement of serpentine\r\n  by calcite, nor indeed by any other species.[AV] If, then, such\r\n  pseudomorphs exist, it appears to be a fact hitherto unobserved,\r\n  and our authors should at least have given us some evidence of this\r\n  remarkable case of pseudomorphism by which they seek to support their\r\n  singular hypothesis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AV: _Annales des Mines_, 5, xvi., 317.]\r\n\r\n  \"I hasten to say, however, that I reject with Scheerer, Delesse\r\n  and Naumann, a great part of the supposed cases of mineral\r\n  pseudomorphism, and do not even admit the pseudomorphous origin of\r\n  serpentine itself, but believe that this, with many other related\r\n  silicates, has been formed by direct chemical precipitation. This\r\n  view, which our authors do me the honour to criticise, was set\r\n  forth by me in 1860 and 1861,[AW] and will be found noticed more\r\n  in detail in the _Geological Report of Canada_, for 1866, p. 229.\r\n  I have there and elsewhere maintained that 'steatite, serpentine,\r\n  pyroxene, hornblende, and in many cases garnet, epidote, and other\r\n  silicated minerals, are formed by a crystallization and molecular\r\n  re-arrangement of silicates, generated by chemical processes in\r\n  waters at the earth's surface.'[AX]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AW: _Amer. Journ. Science_ (2), xxix., 284; xxxii., 286.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AX: _Ibid._, xxxvii., 266; xxxviii., 183.]\r\n\r\n  \"This view, which at once explains the origin of all these bedded\r\n  rocks, and the fact that their constituent mineral species, like\r\n  silica and carbonate of lime, replace the perishable matter of\r\n  organic forms, is designated by Messrs. King and Rowney 'as so\r\n  completely destitute of the characters of a scientific hypothesis\r\n  as to be wholly unworthy of consideration,' and they speak of my\r\n  attempt to maintain this hypothesis as 'a total collapse.' How far\r\n  this statement is from the truth my readers shall judge. My views\r\n  as to the origin of serpentine and other silicated minerals were\r\n  set forth by me as above in 1860-1864, before anything was known\r\n  of the mineralogy of Eozoon, and were forced upon me by my studies\r\n  of the older crystalline schists of North America. Naumann had\r\n  already pointed out the necessity of some such hypothesis when he\r\n  protested against the extravagances of the pseudomorphist school,\r\n  and maintained that the beds of various silicates found in the\r\n  crystalline schists are original deposits, and not formed by an\r\n  epigenic process (_Geognosie_, ii., 65, 154, and _Bull. Soc. Geol.\r\n  de France_, 2, xviii., 678). This conclusion of Naumann's I have\r\n  attempted to explain and support by numerous facts and observations,\r\n  which have led me to the hypothesis in question. Gümbel, who accepts\r\n  Naumann's view, sustains my hypothesis of the origin of these rocks\r\n  in a most emphatic manner,[AY] and Credner, in discussing the genesis\r\n  of the Eozoic rocks, has most ably defended it.[AZ] So much for my\r\n  theoretical views so contemptuously denounced by Messrs. King and\r\n  Rowney, which are nevertheless unhesitatingly adopted by the two\r\n  geologists of the time who have made the most special studies of the\r\n  rocks in question,--Gümbel in Germany, and Credner in North America.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AY: _Proc. Royal Bavarian Acad._ for 1866, translated in\r\n_Can. Naturalist_, iii., 81.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AZ: _Die Gliederung der Eozoischen Formations gruppe\r\nNord.-Amerikas,--a Thesis defended before the University of Leipzig,\r\nMarch 15, 1869_, by Dr. Hermann Credner. Halle, 1869, p. 53.]\r\n\r\n  \"It would be a thankless task to follow Messrs. King and Rowney\r\n  through their long paper, which abounds in statements as unsound as\r\n  those I have just exposed, but I cannot conclude without calling\r\n  attention to one misconception of theirs as to my view of the origin\r\n  of limestones. They quote Professor Hull's remark to the effect that\r\n  the researches of the Canadian geologists and others have shown that\r\n  the oldest known limestones of the world owe their origin to Eozoon,\r\n  and remark that the existence of great limestone beds in the Eozoic\r\n  rocks seems to have influenced Lyell, Ramsay, and others in admitting\r\n  the received view of Eozoon. Were there no other conceivable source\r\n  of limestones than Eozoon or similar calcareous skeletons, one might\r\n  suppose that the presence of such rocks in the Laurentian system\r\n  could have thus influenced these distinguished geologists, but\r\n  there are found beneath the Eozoon horizon two great formations of\r\n  limestone in which this fossil has never been detected. When found,\r\n  indeed, it owes its conservation in a readily recognisable form to\r\n  the fact, that it was preserved by the introduction of serpentine\r\n  at the time of its growth. Above the unbroken Eozoon reefs are\r\n  limestones made up apparently of the debris of Eozoon thus preserved\r\n  by serpentine, and there is no doubt that this calcareous rhizopod,\r\n  growing in water where serpentine was not in process of formation,\r\n  might, and probably did, build up pure limestone beds like those\r\n  formed in later times from the ruins of corals and crinoids. Nor\r\n  is there anything inconsistent in this with the assertion which\r\n  Messrs. King and Rowney quote from me, viz., that the popular notion\r\n  that _all limestone formations_ owe their origin to organic life is\r\n  based upon a fallacy. The idea that marine organisms originate the\r\n  carbonate of lime of their skeletons, in a manner somewhat similar to\r\n  that in which plants generate the organic matter of theirs, appears\r\n  to be commonly held among certain geologists. It cannot, however,\r\n  be too often repeated that animals only appropriate the carbonate\r\n  of lime which is furnished them by chemical reaction. Were there\r\n  no animals present to make use of it, the carbonate of lime would\r\n  accumulate in natural waters till these became saturated, and would\r\n  then be deposited in an insoluble form; and although thousands of\r\n  feet of limestone have been formed from the calcareous skeletons\r\n  of marine animals, it is not less true that great beds of ancient\r\n  marble, like many modern travertines and tufas, have been deposited\r\n  without the intervention of life, and even in waters from which\r\n  living organisms were probably absent. To illustrate this with the\r\n  parallel case of silicious deposits, there are great beds made\r\n  up of silicious shields of diatoms. These during their lifetime\r\n  extracted from the waters the dissolved silica, which, but for their\r\n  intervention, might have accumulated till it was at length deposited\r\n  in the form of schist or of crystalline quartz. In either case the\r\n  function of the coral, the rhizopod, or the diatom is limited to\r\n  assimilating the carbonate of lime or the silica from its solution,\r\n  and the organised form thus given to these substances is purely\r\n  accidental. It is characteristic of our authors, that, rather than\r\n  admit the limestone beds of the Eozoon rocks to have been formed like\r\n  beds of coralline limestone, or deposited as chemical precipitates\r\n  like travertine, they prefer, as they assure us, to regard them as\r\n  the results of that hitherto unheard-of process, the pseudomorphism\r\n  of serpentine; as if the deposition of the carbonate of lime in\r\n  the place of dissolved serpentine were a simpler process than its\r\n  direct deposition in one or the other of the ways which all the world\r\n  understands!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(C.) Dr. Carpenter on the Foraminiferal Relations of Eozoon.\r\n\r\n  In the _Annals of Natural History_, for June, 1874, Dr. Carpenter\r\n  has given a crushing reply to some objections raised in that journal\r\n  by Mr. Carter. He first shows, contrary to the statement of Mr.\r\n  Carter, that the fine nummuline tubulation corresponds precisely in\r\n  its direction with reference to the chambers, with that observed in\r\n  Nummulites and Orbitoides. In the second place, he shows by clear\r\n  descriptions and figures, that the relation of the canal system to\r\n  the fine tubulation is precisely that which he had demonstrated in\r\n  more recent nummuline and rotaline Foraminifera. In the third place\r\n  he adduces additional facts to show that in some specimens of Eozoon\r\n  the calcareous skeleton has been filled with calcite before the\r\n  introduction of any foreign mineral matter. He concludes the argument\r\n  in the following words:--\r\n\r\n  \"I have thus shown:--(1) that the 'utter incompatibility' asserted\r\n  by my opponents to exist between the arrangement of the supposed\r\n  'nummuline tubulation' of Eozoon and true Nummuline structure, so far\r\n  from having any real existence, really furnishes an additional point\r\n  of conformity; and (2) that three most striking and complete points\r\n  of conformity exist between the structure of the best-preserved\r\n  specimens of Eozoon, and that of the Nummulites whose tubulation I\r\n  described in 1849, and of the Calcarina whose tubulation and canal\r\n  system I described in 1860.\r\n\r\n  \"That I have not troubled myself to reply to the reiterated arguments\r\n  in favour of the doctrine [of mineral origin] advanced by Professors\r\n  King and Rowney on the strength of the occurrence of undoubted\r\n  results of mineralization in the Canadian Ophite, and of still more\r\n  marked evidences of the same action in other Ophites, has been\r\n  simply because these arguments appeared to me, as I thought they\r\n  must also appear to others, entirely destitute of logical force.\r\n  Every scientific palæontologist I have ever been acquainted with has\r\n  taken the _best_ preserved specimens, not the _worst_, as the basis\r\n  of his reconstructions; and if he should meet with distinct evidence\r\n  of characteristic organic structure in even a very small fragment\r\n  of a doubtful form, he would consider the organic origin of that\r\n  form to be thereby substantiated, whatever might be the evidence of\r\n  purely mineral arrangement which the greater part of his specimen\r\n  may present,--since he would regard that arrangement as a probable\r\n  result of _subsequent_ mineralization, by which the original organic\r\n  structure has been more or less obscured. If this is _not_ to be our\r\n  rule of interpretation, a large part of the palæontological work\r\n  of our time must be thrown aside as worthless. If, for example,\r\n  Professors King and Rowney were to begin their study of Nummulites\r\n  by the examination of their most mineralized forms, they would deem\r\n  themselves justified (according to their canons of interpretation)\r\n  in denying the existence of the tubulation and canalization which I\r\n  described (in 1849) in the N. lævigata preserved almost unaltered in\r\n  the London Clay of Bracklesham Bay.\r\n\r\n  \"My own notions of Eozoic structure have been formed on the\r\n  examination of the Canadian specimens selected by the experienced\r\n  discrimination of Sir William Logan, as those in which there was\r\n  _least_ appearance of metamorphism; and having found in these what I\r\n  regarded as unmistakable evidence of an organic structure conformable\r\n  to the foraminiferal type, I cannot regard it as any disproof of\r\n  that conformity, either to show that the true Eozoic structure has\r\n  been frequently altered by mineral metamorphism, or to adduce the\r\n  occurrence of Ophites more or less resembling the Eozoon of the\r\n  Canadian Laurentians at various subsequent geological epochs. The\r\n  existence of any number or variety of _purely mineral_ Ophites would\r\n  not disprove the organic origin of the Canadian Eozoon--unless\r\n  it could be shown that some wonderful process of mineralization\r\n  is competent to construct not only its multiplied alternating\r\n  lamellæ of calcite and serpentine, the dendritic extensions of the\r\n  latter into the former, and the 'acicular layer' of decalcified\r\n  specimens, but (1) the _pre-existing canalization_ of the calcareous\r\n  lamellæ, (2) the _unfilled nummuline tubulation_ of the proper\r\n  wall of the chambers, and (3) the peculiar _calcarine_ relation of\r\n  the canalization and tubulation, here described and figured from\r\n  specimens in the highest state of preservation, showing the _least_\r\n  evidence of any mineral change.\r\n\r\n  \"On the other hand, Professors King and Rowney began their studies of\r\n  Eozoic structure upon the Galway Ophite--a rock which Sir Roderick\r\n  Murchison described to me at the time as having been so much 'tumbled\r\n  about,' that he was not at all sure of its geological position, and\r\n  which exhibits such obvious evidences of mineralization, with such\r\n  an entire absence of any vestige of organic structure, that I should\r\n  never for a moment have thought of crediting it with an organic\r\n  origin, but for the general resemblance of its serpentine-grains\r\n  to those of the 'acervuline' portion of the Canadian Eozoon. They\r\n  pronounced with the most positive certainty upon the mineral origin\r\n  of the Canadian Eozoon, before they had subjected transparent\r\n  sections of it to any of that careful comparison with similar\r\n  sections of recent Foraminifera, which had been the basis of\r\n  Dr. Dawson's original determination, and of my own subsequent\r\n  confirmation, of its organic structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                                                            Plate VIII.\r\n\r\n                  _Eozoon and Chrysotile Veins, etc._\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.--Portion of two laminæ and intervening serpentine,\r\n      with chrysotile vein.

In this respect our dawn-animal has scarcely\r\nyet had justice; and we may not be able to render this in these pages.\r\nLet us put it into the witness-box, however, and try to elicit its\r\ntestimony as to the beginnings of life.\r\n\r\nLooking down from the elevation of our physiological and mental\r\nsuperiority, it is difficult to realize the exact conditions in which\r\nlife exists in creatures so simple as the Protozoa. There may perhaps\r\nbe higher intelligences that find it equally difficult to realize how\r\nlife and reason can manifest themselves in such poor houses of clay\r\nas those we inhabit. But placing ourselves near to these creatures,\r\nand entering as it were into sympathy with them, we can understand\r\nsomething of their powers and feelings. In the first place it is plain\r\nthat they can vigorously, if roughly, exercise those mechanical,\r\nchemical, and vegetative powers of life which are characteristic of\r\nthe animal. They can seize, swallow, digest, and assimilate food; and,\r\nemploying its albuminous parts in nourishing their tissues, can burn\r\naway the rest in processes akin to our respiration, or reject it from\r\ntheir system. Like us, they can subsist only on food which the plant\r\nhas previously produced; for in this world, from the beginning of time,\r\nthe plant has been the only organism which could use the solar light\r\nand heat as forces to enable it to turn the dead elements of matter\r\ninto living, growing tissues, and into organic compounds capable of\r\nnourishing the animal. Like us, the Protozoa expend the food which\r\nthey have assimilated in the production of animal force, and in doing\r\nso cause it to be oxidized, or burnt away, and resolved again into\r\ndead matter. It is true that we have much more complicated apparatus\r\nfor performing these functions, but it does not follow that this gives\r\nus much real superiority, except relatively to the more difficult\r\nconditions of our existence. The gourmand who enjoys his dinner may\r\nhave no more pleasure in the act than the Amœba which swallows a\r\nDiatom; and for all that the man knows of the subsequent processes to\r\nwhich the food is subjected, his interior might be a mass of jelly,\r\nwith extemporised vacuoles, like that of his humble fellow-animal. The\r\nworkman or the athlete has bones and muscles of vastly complicated\r\nstructure, but to him the muscular act is as simple and unconscious a\r\nprocess as the sending out of a pseudopod to a Protozoon. The clay is\r\nafter all the same, and there may be as much credit to the artist in\r\nmaking a simple organism with varied powers, as a more complex frame\r\nfor doing nicer work. It is a weakness of humanity to plume itself on\r\nadvantages not of its own making, and to treat its superior gifts as\r\nif they were the result of its own endeavours. The truculent traveller\r\nwho illustrated his boast of superiority over the Indian by comparing\r\nhis rifle with the bow and arrows of the savage, was well answered by\r\nthe question, \"Can you make a rifle?\" and when he had to answer, \"No,\"\r\nby the rejoinder, \"Then I am at least better than you, for I can make\r\nmy bow and arrows.\" The Amœba or the Eozoon is probably no more than we\r\nits own creator; but if it could produce itself out of vegetable matter\r\nor out of inorganic substances, it might claim in so far a higher\r\nplace in the scale of being than we; and as it is, it can assert equal\r\npowers of digestion, assimilation, and motion, with much less of bodily\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may feel, a complicated apparatus of nerves and\r\nbrain-cells has to be constructed and set to work; but the Protozoon,\r\nwithout any distinct brain, is all brain, and its sensation is simply\r\ndirect. Thus vision in these creatures is probably performed in a rough\r\nway by any part of their transparent bodies, and taste and smell are no\r\ndoubt in the same case. Whether they have any perception of sound as\r\ndistinct from the mere vibrations ascertained by touch, we do not know.\r\nHere also we are not far removed above the Protozoa, especially those\r\nof us to whom touch, seeing, and hearing are mere feelings, without\r\nthought or knowledge of the apparatus employed. We might so far as\r\nwell be Amœbas. As we rise higher we meet with more differences. Yet\r\nit is evident that our gelatinous fellow-being can feel pain, dread\r\ndanger, desire possessions, enjoy pleasure, and in a simple unconscious\r\nway entertain many of the appetites and passions that affect ourselves.\r\nThe wonder is that with so little of organization it can do so much.\r\nYet, perhaps, life can manifest itself in a broader and more intense\r\nway where there is little organization; and a highly strung and\r\ncomplex organism is not so much a necessary condition of a higher life\r\nas a mere means of better adapting it to its present surroundings.\r\nThose philosophies which identify the thinking mind with the material\r\norganism, must seem outrageous blunders to an Amœba on the one hand, or\r\nto an angel on the other, could either be enabled to understand them;\r\nwhich, however, is not very probable, as they are too intimately bound\r\nup with the mere prejudices incident to the present condition of our\r\nhumanity. In any case the Protozoa teach us how much of animal function\r\nmay be fulfilled by a very simple organism, and warn us against the\r\nfallacy that creatures of this simple structure are necessarily nearer\r\nto inorganic matter, and more easily developed from it than beings of\r\nmore complex mould.\r\n\r\nA similar lesson is taught by the complexity of their skeletons.\r\nWe speak in a crude unscientific way of these animals accumulating\r\ncalcareous matter, and building up reefs of limestone. We must,\r\nhowever, bear in mind that they are as dependent on their food for\r\nthe materials of their skeletons as we are, and that their crusts\r\ngrow in the interior of the sarcode just as our bones do within our\r\nbodies. The provision even for nourishing the interior of the skeleton\r\nby tubuli and canals is in principle similar to that involved in the\r\nHaversian canals, cells, and canalicules of bone. The Amœba of course\r\nknows neither more nor less of this than the average Englishman.\r\nIt is altogether a matter of unconscious growth. The process in\r\nthe Protozoa strikes some minds, however, as the more wonderful of\r\nthe two. It is, says an eminent modern physiologist, a matter of\r\n\"profound significance\" that this \"particle of jelly [the sarcode\r\nof a Foraminifer] is capable of guiding physical forces in such a\r\nmanner as to give rise to these exquisite and almost mathematically\r\narranged structures.\" Respecting the structures themselves there is no\r\nexaggeration in this. No arch or dome framed by human skill is more\r\nperfect in beauty or in the realization of mechanical ideas than the\r\ntests of some Foraminifera, and none is so complete and wonderful in\r\nits internal structure. The particle of jelly, however, is a figure of\r\nspeech. The body of the humblest Foraminifer is much more than this.\r\nIt is an organism with divers parts, as we have already seen in a\r\nprevious chapter, and it is endowed with the mysterious forces of life\r\nwhich in it guide the physical forces, just as they do in building\r\nup phosphate of lime in our bones, or indeed just as the will of the\r\narchitect does in building a palace. The profound significance which\r\nthis has, reaches beyond the domain of the physical and vital, even to\r\nthe spiritual. It clings to all our conceptions of living things: quite\r\nas much, for example, to the evolution of an animal with all its parts\r\nfrom a one-celled germ, or to the connection of brain-cells with the\r\nmanifestations of intelligence. Viewed in this way, we may share with\r\nthe author of the sentence I have quoted his feeling of veneration in\r\nthe presence of this great wonder of animal life, \"burning, and not\r\nconsumed,\" nay, building up, and that in many and beautiful forms. We\r\nmay realize it most of all in the presence of the organism which was\r\nperhaps the first to manifest on our planet these marvellous powers.\r\nWe must, however, here also, beware of that credulity which makes too\r\nmany thinkers limit their conceptions altogether to physical force\r\nin matters of this kind. The merely materialistic physiologist is\r\nreally in no better position than the savage who quails before the\r\nthunderstorm, or rejoices in the solar warmth, and seeing no force or\r\npower beyond, fancies himself in the immediate presence of his God. In\r\nEozoon we must discern not only a mass of jelly, but a being endowed\r\nwith that higher vital force which surpasses vegetable life and also\r\nphysical and chemical forces; and in this animal energy we must see an\r\nemanation from a Will higher than our own, ruling vitality itself; and\r\nthis not merely to the end of constructing the skeleton of a Protozoon,\r\nbut of elaborating all the wonderful developments of life that were to\r\nfollow in succeeding ages, and with reference to which the production\r\nand growth of this creature were initial steps. It is this mystery of\r\ndesign which really constitutes the \"profound significance\" of the\r\nforaminiferal skeleton.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon of animality forced upon our notice by the Protozoa\r\nis that of the conditions of life in animals not individual, as we\r\nare, but aggregative and cumulative in indefinite masses. What, for\r\ninstance, the relations to each other of the Polyps, growing together\r\nin a coral mass, of the separate parts of a Sponge, or the separate\r\ncells of a Foraminifer, or of the sarcode mass of an indefinitely\r\nspread out Stromatopora or Bathybius. In the case of the Polyps, we\r\nmay believe that there is special sensation in the tentacles and\r\noral opening of each individual, and that each may experience hunger\r\nwhen in want, or satisfaction when it is filled with food, and that\r\ninjuries to one part of the mass may indirectly affect other parts,\r\nbut that the nutrition of the whole mass may be as much unfelt by the\r\nindividual Polyps as the processes going on in our own bones are by\r\nus. So in the case of a large Sponge or Foraminifer, there may be some\r\nspecial sensation in individual cells, pseudopods, or segments, and\r\nthe general sensation may be very limited, while unconscious living\r\npowers pervade the whole. In this matter of aggregation of animals we\r\nhave thus various grades. The Foraminifers and Sponges present us with\r\nthe simplest of all, and that which most resembles the aggregation of\r\nbuds in the plant. The Polyps and complex Bryozoons present a higher\r\nand more specialised type; and though the bilateral symmetry which\r\nobtains in the higher animals is of a different nature, it still at\r\nleast reminds us of that multiplication of similar parts which we see\r\nin the lower grades of being. It is worthy of notice here that the\r\nlower animals which show aggregative tendencies present but imperfect\r\nindications, or none at all, of bilateral symmetry. Their bodies, like\r\nthose of plants, are for the most part built up around a central axis,\r\nor they show tendencies to spiral modes of growth.\r\n\r\nIt is this composite sort of life which is connected with the main\r\ngeological function of the Foraminifer. While active sensation,\r\nappetite, and enjoyment pervade the pseudopods and external sarcode\r\nof the mass, the hard skeleton common to the whole is growing within;\r\nand in this way the calcareous matter is gradually removed from\r\nthe sea water, and built up in solid reefs, or in piles of loose\r\nforaminiferal shells. Thus it is the aggregative or common life,\r\nalike in Foraminifers as in Corals, that tends most powerfully to the\r\naccumulation of calcareous matter; and those creatures whose life is\r\nof this complex character are best suited to be world-builders, since\r\nthe result of their growth is not merely a cemetery of their osseous\r\nremains, but a huge communistic edifice, to which multitudes of lives\r\nhave contributed, and in which successive generations take up their\r\nabode on the remains of their ancestors. This process, so potent in\r\nthe progress of the earth's geological history, began, as far as we\r\nknow, with Eozoon.\r\n\r\nWhether, then, in questioning our proto-foraminifer, we have reference\r\nto the vital functions of its gelatinous sarcode, to the complexity and\r\nbeauty of its calcareous test, or to its capacity for effecting great\r\nmaterial results through the union of individuals, we perceive that we\r\nhave to do, not with a low condition of those powers which we designate\r\nlife, but with the manifestation of those powers through the means of a\r\nsimple organism; and this in a degree of perfection which we, from our\r\npoint of view, would have in the first instance supposed impossible.\r\n\r\nIf we imagine a world altogether destitute of life, we still might\r\nhave geological formations in progress. Not only would volcanoes belch\r\nforth their liquid lavas and their stones and ashes, but the waves and\r\ncurrents of the ocean and the rains and streams on the land, with the\r\nceaseless decomposing action of the carbonic acid of the atmosphere,\r\nwould be piling up mud, sand, and pebbles in the sea. There might even\r\nbe some formation of limestone taking place where springs charged\r\nwith bicarbonate of lime were oozing out on the land or the bottom of\r\nthe waters. But in such a world all the carbon would be in the state\r\nof carbonic acid, and all the limestone would either be diffused in\r\nsmall quantities through various rocks or in limited local beds, or\r\nin solution, perhaps as chloride of calcium, in the sea. Dr. Hunt has\r\ngiven chemical grounds for supposing that the most ancient seas were\r\nlargely supplied with this very soluble salt, instead of the chloride\r\nof sodium, or common salt, which now prevails in the sea-water.\r\n\r\nWhere in such a world would life be introduced? on the land or in the\r\nwaters? All scientific probability would say in the latter. The ocean\r\nis now vastly more populous than the land. The waters alone afford\r\nthe conditions necessary at once for the most minute and the grandest\r\norganisms, at once for the simplest and for others of the most complex\r\ncharacter. Especially do they afford the best conditions for those\r\nanimals which subsist in complex communities, and which aggregate large\r\nquantities of mineral matter in their skeletons. So true is this that\r\nup to the present time all the species of Protozoa and of the animals\r\nmost nearly allied to them are aquatic. Even in the waters, however,\r\nplant life, though possibly in very simple forms, must precede the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nLet humble plants, then, be introduced in the waters, and they would\r\nat once begin to use the solar light for the purpose of decomposing\r\ncarbonic acid, and forming carbon compounds which had not before\r\nexisted, and which independently of vegetable life would never have\r\nexisted. At the same time lime and other mineral substances present in\r\nthe sea-water would be fixed in the tissues of these plants, either in\r\na minute state of division, as little grains or Coccoliths, or in more\r\nsolid masses like those of the Corallines and Nullipores. In this way\r\na beginning of limestone formation might be made, and quantities of\r\ncarbonaceous and bituminous matter, resulting from the decay of marine\r\nplants might accumulate in the sea-bottom. Now arises the opportunity\r\nfor animal life. The plants have collected stores of organic matter,\r\nand their minute germs, along with microscopic species, are floating\r\neverywhere in the sea. Nay, there may be abundant examples of those\r\nAmœba-like germs of aquatic plants, simulating for a time the life\r\nof the animal, and then returning into the circle of vegetable life.\r\nIn these some might see precursors of the Protozoa, though they are\r\nprobably rather prophetic analogues than blood relations. The plant\r\nhas fulfilled its function as far as the waters are concerned, and now\r\narises the opportunity for the animal. In what form shall it appear?\r\nMany of its higher forms, those which depend upon animal food or on the\r\nmore complex plants for subsistence, would obviously be unsuitable.\r\nFurther, the sea-water is still too much saturated with saline matter\r\nto be fit for the higher animals of the waters. Still further, there\r\nmay be a residue of internal heat forbidding coolness, and that\r\nsolution of free oxygen which is an essential condition of existence to\r\nmost of the modern animals. Something must be found suitable for this\r\nsaline, imperfectly oxygenated, tepid sea. Something too is wanted that\r\ncan aid in introducing conditions more favourable to higher life in\r\nthe future. Our experience of the modern world shows us that all these\r\nconditions can be better fulfilled by the Protozoa than by any other\r\ncreatures. They can live now equally in those great depths of ocean\r\nwhere the conditions are most unfavourable to other forms of life, and\r\nin tepid unhealthy pools overstocked with vegetable matter in a state\r\nof putridity. They form a most suitable basis for higher forms of life.\r\nThey have remarkable powers of removing mineral matters from the waters\r\nand of fixing them in solid forms. So in the fitness of things Eozoon\r\nis just what we need, and after it has spread itself over the mud and\r\nrock of the primeval seas, and built up extensive reefs therein, other\r\nanimals may be introduced capable of feeding on it, or of sheltering\r\nthemselves in its stony masses, and thus we have the appropriate dawn\r\nof animal life.\r\n\r\nBut what are we to say of the cause of this new series of facts, so\r\nwonderfully superimposed upon the merely vegetable and mineral? Must\r\nit remain to us as an act of creation, or was it derived from some\r\npre-existing matter in which it had been potentially present? Science\r\nfails to inform us, but conjectural \"phylogeny\" steps in and takes its\r\nplace. Haeckel, the prophet of this new philosophy, waves his magic\r\nwand, and simple masses of sarcode spring from inorganic matter, and\r\nform diffused sheets of sea-slime, from which are in time separated\r\ndistinct Amœboid and Foraminiferal forms. Experience, however, gives us\r\nno facts whereon to build this supposition, and it remains neither more\r\nnor less scientific or certain than that old fancy of the Egyptians,\r\nwhich derived animals from the fertile mud of the Nile.\r\n\r\nIf we fail to learn anything of the origin of Eozoon, and if its\r\nlife-processes are just as inscrutable as those of higher creatures,\r\nwe can at least inquire as to its history in geological time. In this\r\nrespect we find in the first place that the Protozoa have not had\r\na monopoly in their profession of accumulators of calcareous rock.\r\nOriginated by Eozoon in the old Laurentian time, this process has\r\nbeen proceeding throughout the geological ages; and while Protozoa,\r\nequally simple with the great prototype of the race, have been and\r\nare continuing its function, and producing new limestones in every\r\ngeological period, and so adding to the volume of the successive\r\nformations, new workers of higher grades have been introduced, capable\r\nof enjoying higher forms of animal activity, and equally of labouring\r\nat the great task of continent-building; of existing, too, in seas\r\nless rich in mineral substances than those of the Eozoic time, and for\r\nthat very reason better suited to higher and more skilled artists. It\r\nis to be observed in connection with this, that as the work of the\r\nForaminifers has thus been assumed by others, their size and importance\r\nhave diminished, and the grander forms of more recent times have some\r\nof them been fain to build up their hard parts of cemented sand instead\r\nof limestone.\r\n\r\nBut we further find that, while the first though not the only organic\r\ngatherers of limestone from the ocean waters, they have had to do, not\r\nmerely with the formation of calcareous sediments, but also with that\r\nof silicious deposits. The greenish silicate called glauconite, or\r\ngreen-sand, is found to be associated with much of the foraminiferal\r\nslime now accumulating in the ocean, and also with the older deposits\r\nof this kind now consolidated in chalks and similar rocks. This name\r\nglauconite is, as Dr. Hunt has shown, employed to designate not only\r\nthe hydrous silicate of iron and potash, which perhaps has the best\r\nright to it, but also compounds which contain in addition large\r\npercentages of alumina, or magnesia, or both; and one glauconite from\r\nthe Tertiary limestones near Paris, is said to be a true serpentine,\r\nor hydrous silicate of magnesia.[BA] Now the association of such\r\nsubstances with Foraminifera is not purely accidental. Just as a\r\nfragment of decaying wood, imbedded in sediment, has the power of\r\ndecomposing soluble silicates carried to it by water, and parting with\r\nits carbon in the form of carbonic acid, in exchange for the silica,\r\nand thus replacing, particle by particle, the carbon of the wood\r\nwith silicon, so that at length it becomes petrified into a flinty\r\nmass, so the sarcode of a Foraminifer, which is a more dense kind of\r\nanimal matter than is usually supposed, can in like manner abstract\r\nsilica from the surrounding water or water-soaked sediment. From some\r\npeculiarity in the conditions of the case, however, our Protozoon\r\nusually becomes petrified with a hydrous silicate instead of with pure\r\nsilica. The favourable conditions presented by the deep sea for the\r\ncombination of silica with bases, may perhaps account in part for\r\nthis. But whatever the cause, it is usual to find fossil Foraminifera\r\nwith their sarcode replaced by such material. We also find beds of\r\nglauconite retaining the forms of Foraminifera, while the calcareous\r\ntests of these have been removed, apparently by acid waters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BA: Berthier, quoted by Hunt.]\r\n\r\nOne consideration which, though conjectural, deserves notice, is\r\nconnected with the food of these humble animals. They are known to feed\r\nto a large extent on minute plants, the Diatoms, and other organisms\r\nhaving silica in their skeletons or cell-walls, and consequently\r\nsoluble silicates in their juices. The silicious matter contained\r\nin these organisms is not wanted by the Foraminifera for their own\r\nskeletons, and will therefore be voided by them as an excrementitious\r\nmatter. In this way, where Foraminifera greatly abound, there may be a\r\nlarge production of soluble silica and silicates, in a condition ready\r\nto enter into new and insoluble compounds, and to fill the cavities\r\nand pores of dead shells. Thus glauconite and even serpentine may,\r\nin a certain sense, be a sort of foraminiferal coprolitic matter or\r\nexcrement. Of course it is not necessary to suppose that this is the\r\nonly source of such materials. They may be formed in other ways; but I\r\nsuggest this as at least a possible link of connection.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the conjecture last mentioned has any validity, there\r\nis another and most curious bond of connection between oceanic\r\nProtozoa and silicious deposits. Professor Wyville Thompson reports\r\nfrom the _Challenger_ soundings, that in certain areas of the South\r\nPacific the ordinary foraminiferal ooze is replaced by a peculiar red\r\nclay, which he attributes to the action of water laden with carbonic\r\nacid, in removing all the lime, and leaving this red mud as a sort\r\nof ash, composed of silica, alumina, and iron oxide. Now this is in\r\nall probability a product of the decomposition and oxidation of the\r\nglauconitic matter contained in the ooze. Thus we learn that when areas\r\non which calcareous deposits have been accumulated by Protozoa, are\r\ninvaded by cold arctic or antarctic waters charged with carbonic acid,\r\nthe carbonate of lime may be removed, and the glauconite left, or even\r\nthe latter may be decomposed, leaving silicious, aluminous, and other\r\ndeposits, which may be quite destitute of any organic structures, or\r\nretain only such remnants of them as have been accidentally or by\r\ntheir more resisting character protected from destruction.[BB] In this\r\nway it may be possible that many silicious rocks of the Laurentian\r\nand Primordial ages, which now show no trace of organization, may be\r\nindirectly products of the action of life. When the recent deposits\r\ndiscovered by the _Challenger_ dredgings shall have been more fully\r\nexamined, we may perhaps have the means of distinguishing such rocks,\r\nand thus of still further enlarging our conceptions of the part played\r\nby Protozoa in the drama of the earth's history. In any case it seems\r\nplain that beds of green-sand and similar hydrous silicates may be the\r\nresidue of thick deposits of foraminiferal limestone or chalky matter,\r\nand that these silicates may in their turn be oxidised and decomposed,\r\nleaving beds of apparently inorganic clay. Such beds may finally be\r\nconsolidated and rendered crystalline by metamorphism, and thus a\r\ngreat variety of silicated rocks may result, retaining little or no\r\nindication of any connection with the agency of life. We can scarcely\r\nyet conjecture the amount of light which these new facts may eventually\r\nthrow on the serpentine and other rocks of the Eozoic age. In the\r\nmeantime they open up a noble field to chemists and microscopists.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BB: The \"red chalk\" of Antrim, and that of Speeton, contain\r\narenaceous Foraminifera and silicious casts of their shells, apparently\r\ndifferent from typical glauconite, and the extremely fine ferruginous\r\nand argillaceous sediment of these chalks may well be decomposed\r\nglauconitic matter like that of the South Pacific. I have found these\r\nbeds, the hard limestones of the French Neocomian, and the altered\r\ngreen-sands of the Alps, very instructive for comparison with the\r\nLaurentian limestones; and they well deserve study by all interested in\r\nsuch subjects.]\r\n\r\nWhen the marvellous results of recent deep-sea dredgings were first\r\nmade known, and it was found that chalky foraminiferal earth is yet\r\naccumulating in the Atlantic, with sponges and sea urchins resembling\r\nin many respects those whose remains exist in the chalk, the fact was\r\nexpressed by the statement that we still live in the chalk period. Thus\r\nstated the conclusion is scarcely correct. We do not live in the chalk\r\nperiod, but the conditions of the chalk period still exist in the\r\ndeep sea. We may say more than this. To some extent the conditions of\r\nthe Laurentian period still exist in the sea, except in so far as they\r\nhave been removed by the action of the Foraminifera and other limestone\r\nbuilders. To those who can realize the enormous lapse of time involved\r\nin the geological history of the earth, this conveys an impression\r\nalmost of eternity in the existence of this oldest of all the families\r\nof the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe are still more deeply impressed with this when we bring into view\r\nthe great physical changes which have occurred since the dawn of life.\r\nWhen we consider that the skeletons of Eozoon contribute to form the\r\noldest hills of our continents; that they have been sealed up in solid\r\nmarble, and that they are associated with hard crystalline rocks\r\ncontorted in the most fantastic manner; that these rocks have almost\r\nfrom the beginning of geological time been undergoing waste to supply\r\nthe material of new formations; that they have witnessed innumerable\r\nsubsidences and elevations of the continents; and that the greatest\r\nmountain chains of the earth have been built up from the sea since\r\nEozoon began to exist,--we acquire a most profound impression of the\r\npersistence of the lower forms of animal life, and know that mountains\r\nmay be removed and continents swept away and replaced, before the least\r\nof the humble gelatinous Protozoa can finally perish. Life may be a\r\nfleeting thing in the individual, but as handed down through successive\r\ngenerations of beings, and as a constant animating power in successive\r\norganisms, it appears, like its Creator, eternal.\r\n\r\nThis leads to another and very serious question. How long did lineal\r\ndescendants of Eozoon exist, and do they still exist? We may for the\r\npresent consider this question apart from ideas of derivation and\r\nelevation into higher planes of existence. Eozoon as a species and\r\neven as a genus may cease to exist with the Eozoic age, and we have no\r\nevidence whatever that Archæocyathus, Stromatopora, or Receptaculites\r\nare its modified descendants. As far as their structures inform us,\r\nthey may as much claim to be original creations as Eozoon itself.\r\nStill descendants of Eozoon may have continued to exist, though we\r\nhave not yet met with them. I should not be surprised to hear of a\r\nveritable specimen being some day dredged alive in the Atlantic or\r\nthe Pacific. It is also to be observed that in animals so simple as\r\nEozoon many varieties may appear, widely different from the original.\r\nIn these the general form and habit of life are the most likely things\r\nto change, the minute structures much less so. We need not, therefore,\r\nbe surprised to find its descendants diminishing in size or altering\r\nin general form, while the characters of the fine tubulation and of\r\nthe canal system would remain. We need not wonder if any sessile\r\nForaminifer of the Nummuline group should prove to be a descendant\r\nof Eozoon. It would be less likely that a Sponge or a Foraminifer of\r\nthe Rotaline type should originate from it. If one could only secure\r\na succession of deep-sea limestones with Foraminifers, extending all\r\nthe way from the Laurentian to the present time, I can imagine nothing\r\nmore interesting than to compare the whole series, with the view of\r\nascertaining the limits of descent with variation, and the points where\r\nnew forms are introduced. We have not yet such a series, but it may be\r\nobtained; and as Foraminifera are eminently cosmopolitan, occurring\r\nover vastly wide areas of sea-bottom, and are very variable, they would\r\nafford a better test of theories of derivation than any that can be\r\nobtained from the more locally distributed and less variable animals\r\nof higher grade. I was much struck with this recently, in examining a\r\nseries of Foraminifera from the Cretaceous of Manitoba, and comparing\r\nthem with the varietal forms of the same species in the interior of\r\nNebraska, 500 miles to the south, and with those of the English chalk\r\nand of the modern seas. In all these different times and places we had\r\nthe same species. In all they existed under so many varietal forms\r\npassing into each other, that in former times every species had been\r\nmultiplied into several. Yet in all, the identical varietal forms\r\nwere repeated with the most minute markings alike. Here were at once\r\nconstancy the most remarkable and variations the most extensive. If we\r\ndwell on the one to the exclusion of the other, we reach only one-sided\r\nconclusions, imperfect and unsatisfactory. By taking both in connection\r\nwe can alone realize the full significance of the facts. We cannot\r\nyet obtain such series for all geological time; but it may even now\r\nbe worth while to inquire, What do we know as to any modification in\r\nthe case of the primeval Foraminifers, whether with reference to the\r\nderivation from them of other Protozoa or of higher forms of life?\r\n\r\nThere is no link whatever in geological fact to connect Eozoon with any\r\nof the Mollusks, Radiates, or Crustaceans of the succeeding Primordial.\r\nWhat may be discovered in the future we cannot conjecture; but at\r\npresent these stand before us as distinct creations. It would of course\r\nbe more probable that Eozoon should be the ancestor of some of the\r\nForaminifera of the Primordial age, but strangely enough it is very\r\ndissimilar from all these except Stromatopora; and here, as already\r\nstated, the evidence of minute structure fails to a great extent, and\r\nEozoon Bavaricum of the Huronian age scarcely helps to bridge over the\r\ngap which yawns in our imperfect geological record. Of actual facts,\r\ntherefore, we have none; and those evolutionists who have regarded the\r\ndawn-animal as an evidence in their favour, have been obliged to have\r\nrecourse to supposition and assumption.\r\n\r\nTaking the ground of the derivationist, it is convenient to assume\r\n(1) that Eozoon was either the first or nearly the first of animals,\r\nand that, being a Protozoan of simple structure, it constitutes an\r\nappropriate beginning of life; (2) that it originated from some\r\nunexplained change in the protoplasmic or albuminous matter of some\r\nhumble plant, or directly from inorganic matter, or at least was\r\ndescended from some creature only a little more simple which had\r\nbeing in this way; (3) that it had in itself unlimited capacities\r\nfor variation and also for extension in time; (4) that it tended to\r\nmultiply rapidly, and at last so to occupy the ocean that a struggle\r\nfor existence arose; (5) that though at first, from the very nature\r\nof its origin, adapted to the conditions of the world, yet as these\r\nconditions became altered by physical changes, it was induced to\r\naccommodate itself to them, and so to pass into new species and genera,\r\nuntil at last it appeared in entirely new types in the Primordial fauna.\r\n\r\nThese assumptions are, with the exception of the first two, merely\r\nthe application to Eozoon of what have been called the Darwinian laws\r\nof multiplication, of limited population, of variation, of change of\r\nphysical conditions, and of equilibrium of nature. If otherwise proved,\r\nand shown to be applicable to creatures like Eozoon, of course we must\r\napply them to it; but in so far as that creature itself is concerned\r\nthey are incapable of proof, and some of them contrary to such evidence\r\nas we have. We have, for example, no connecting link between Eozoon and\r\nany form of vegetable life. Its structures are such as to enable us at\r\nonce to assign it to the animal kingdom, and if we seek for connecting\r\nlinks between the lower animals and plants we have to look for them\r\nin the modern waters. We have no reason to conclude that Eozoon could\r\nmultiply so rapidly as to fill all the stations suitable for it, and to\r\ncommence a struggle for existence. On the contrary, after the lapse of\r\nuntold ages the conditions for the life of Foraminifers still exist\r\nover two-thirds of the surface of the earth. In regard to variation, we\r\nhave, it is true, evidence of the wide range of varieties of species\r\nin Protozoa, within the limits of the group, but none whatever of any\r\ntendency to pass into other groups. Nor can it be proved that the\r\nconditions of the ocean were so different in Cambrian or Silurian times\r\nas to preclude the continued and comfortable existence of Eozoon.\r\nNew creatures came in which superseded it, and new conditions more\r\nfavourable in proportion to these new creatures, but neither the new\r\ncreatures nor the new conditions were necessarily or probably connected\r\nwith Eozoon, any farther than that it may have served newer tribes of\r\nanimals for food, and may have rid the sea of some of its superfluous\r\nlime in their interest. In short, the hypothesis of evolution will\r\nexplain the derivation of other animals from Eozoon if we adopt its\r\nassumptions, just as it will in that case explain anything else, but\r\nthe assumptions are improbable, and contrary to such facts as we know.\r\n\r\nEozoon itself, however, bears some negative though damaging testimony\r\nagainst evolution, and its argument may be thus stated in what we may\r\nimagine to be its own expressions:--\"I, Eozoon Canadense, being a\r\ncreature of low organization and intelligence, and of practical turn,\r\nam no theorist, but have a lively appreciation of such facts as I am\r\nable to perceive. I found myself growing upon the sea-bottom, and know\r\nnot whence I came. I grew and flourished for ages, and found no let or\r\nhindrance to my expansion, and abundance of food was always floated\r\nto me without my having to go in search of it. At length a change\r\ncame. Certain creatures with hard snouts and jaws began to prey on\r\nme. Whence they came I know not; I cannot think that they came from\r\nthe germs which I had dispersed so abundantly throughout the ocean.\r\nUnfortunately, just at the same time lime became a little less abundant\r\nin the waters, perhaps because of the great demands I myself had made,\r\nand thus it was not so easy as before to produce a thick supplemental\r\nskeleton for defence. So I had to give way. I have done my best to\r\navoid extinction; but it is clear that I must at length be overcome,\r\nand must either disappear or subside into a humbler condition, and that\r\nother creatures better provided for the new conditions of the world\r\nmust take my place.\" In such terms we may suppose that this patriarch\r\nof the seas might tell his history, and mourn his destiny, though he\r\nmight also congratulate himself on having in an honest way done his\r\nduty and fulfilled his function in the world, leaving it to other and\r\nperhaps wiser creatures to dispute as to his origin and fate, while\r\nmuch less perfectly fulfilling the ends of their own existence.\r\n\r\nThus our dawn-animal has positively no story to tell as to his own\r\nintroduction or his transmutation into other forms of existence.\r\nHe leaves the mystery of creation where it was; but in connection\r\nwith the subsequent history of life we can learn from him a little\r\nas to the laws which have governed the succession of animals in\r\ngeological time. First, we may learn that the plan of creation has been\r\nprogressive, that there has been an advance from the few, low, and\r\ngeneralized types of the primæval ocean to the more numerous, higher,\r\nand more specialized types of more recent times. Secondly, we learn\r\nthat the lower types, when first introduced, and before they were\r\nsubordinated to higher forms of life, existed in some of their grandest\r\nmodifications as to form and complexity, and that in succeeding ages,\r\nwhen higher types were replacing them, they were subjected to decay and\r\ndegeneracy. Thirdly, we learn that while the species has a limited term\r\nof existence in geological time, any grand type of animal existence,\r\nlike that of the Foraminifera or Sponges, for example, once introduced,\r\ncontinues and finds throughout all the vicissitudes of the earth some\r\nappropriate residence. Fourthly, as to the mode of introduction of new\r\ntypes, or whether such creatures as Eozoon had any direct connection\r\nwith the subsequent introduction of mollusks, worms, or crustaceans, it\r\nis altogether silent, nor can it predict anything as to the order or\r\nmanner of their introduction.\r\n\r\nHad we been permitted to visit the Laurentian seas, and to study Eozoon\r\nand its contemporary Protozoa when alive, it is plain that we could not\r\nhave foreseen or predicted from the consideration of such organisms\r\nthe future development of life. No amount of study of the prototypal\r\nForaminifer could have led us distinctly to the conception of even\r\na Sponge or a Polyp, much less of any of the higher animals. Why is\r\nthis? The answer is that the improvement into such higher types does\r\nnot take place by any change of the elementary sarcode, either in those\r\nchemical, mechanical, or vital properties which we can study, but in\r\nthe adding to it of new structures. In the Sponge, which is perhaps\r\nthe nearest type of all, we have the movable pulsating cilium and true\r\nanimal cellular tissue, and along with this the spicular or fibrous\r\nskeleton, these structures leading to an entire change in the mode of\r\nlife and subsistence. In the higher types of animals it is the same.\r\nEven in the highest we have white blood-corpuscles and germinal matter,\r\nwhich, in so far as we know, carry on no higher forms of life than\r\nthose of an Amœba; but they are now made subordinate to other kinds of\r\ntissue, of great variety and complexity, which never have been observed\r\nto arise out of the growth of any Protozoon. There would be only a very\r\nfew conceivable inferences which the highest finite intelligence could\r\ndeduce as to the development of future and higher animals. He might\r\ninfer that the foraminiferal sarcode, once introduced, might be the\r\nsubstratum or foundation of other but unknown tissues in the higher\r\nanimals, and that the Protozoan type might continue to subsist side\r\nby side with higher forms of living things as they were successively\r\nintroduced. He might also infer that the elevation of the animal\r\nkingdom would take place with reference to those new properties of\r\nsensation and voluntary motion in which the humblest animals diverge\r\nfrom the life of the plant.\r\n\r\nIt is important that these points should be clearly before our minds,\r\nbecause there has been current of late among naturalists a loose way\r\nof writing with reference to them, which seems to have imposed on many\r\nwho are not naturalists. It has been said, for example, that such an\r\norganism as Eozoon may include potentially all the structures and\r\nfunctions of the higher animals, and that it is possible that we might\r\nbe able to infer or calculate all these with as much certainty as we\r\ncan calculate an eclipse or any other physical phenomenon. Now, there\r\nis not only no foundation in fact for these assertions, but it is from\r\nour present standpoint not conceivable that they can ever be realized.\r\nThe laws of inorganic matter give no data whence any _à priori_\r\ndeductions or calculations could be made as to the structure and\r\nvital forces of the plant. The plant gives no data from which we can\r\ncalculate the functions of the animal. The Protozoon gives no data from\r\nwhich we can calculate the specialties of the Mollusc, the Articulate,\r\nor the Vertebrate. Nor unhappily do the present conditions of life of\r\nthemselves give us any sure grounds for predicting the new creations\r\nthat may be in store for our old planet. Those who think to build a\r\nphilosophy and even a religion on such data are mere dreamers, and have\r\nno scientific basis for their dogmas. They are more blind guides than\r\nour primæval Protozoon himself would be, in matters whose real solution\r\nlies in the harmony of our own higher and immaterial nature with the\r\nBeing who is the author of all life--the Father \"from whom every\r\nfamily in heaven and earth is named.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this work was going through the press, Lyell, the greatest\r\ngeological thinker of our time, passed away. In the preceding pages I\r\nhave refrained from quoting the many able geologists and biologists who\r\nhave publicly accepted the evidence of the animal nature of Eozoon as\r\nsufficient, preferring to rest my case on its own merits rather than on\r\nauthority; but it is due to the great man whose loss we now mourn, to\r\nsay that, before the discovery of Eozoon, he had expressed on general\r\ngrounds his anticipation that fossils would be found in the rocks older\r\nthan the so-called Primordial Series, and that he at once admitted the\r\norganic nature of Eozoon, and introduced it, as a fossil, into the\r\nedition of his Elements of Geology published in the same year in which\r\nit was described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS OF LAURENTIAN AND HURONIAN PROTOZOA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to students to state the technical characters of\r\nEozoon, in addition to the more popular and general descriptions in the\r\npreceding pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus_ EOZOON.\r\n\r\nForaminiferal skeletons, with irregular and often confluent cells,\r\narranged in concentric and horizontal laminæ, or sometimes piled in an\r\nacervuline manner. Septal orifices irregularly disposed. Proper wall\r\nfinely tubulated. Intermediate skeleton with branching canals.\r\n\r\n\r\nEozoon Canadense, _Dawson_.\r\n\r\nIn rounded masses or thick encrusting sheets, frequently of large\r\ndimensions. Typical structure stromatoporoid, or with concentric\r\ncalcareous walls, frequently uniting with each other, and separating\r\nflat chambers, more or less mammillated, and spreading into horizontal\r\nlobes and small chamberlets; chambers often confluent and crossed by\r\nirregular calcareous pillars connecting the opposite walls. Upper\r\npart often composed of acervuline chambers of rounded forms. Proper\r\nwall tubulated very finely. Intermediate skeleton largely developed,\r\nespecially at the lower part, and traversed by large canals, often\r\nwith smaller canals in their interstices. Lower laminæ and chambers\r\noften three millimetres in thickness. Upper laminæ and chambers one\r\nmillimetre or less. Age Laurentian and perhaps Huronian.\r\n\r\n_Var._ MINOR.--Supplemental skeleton wanting, except near the base, and\r\nwith very fine canals. Laminæ of sarcode much mammillated, thin, and\r\nseparated by very thin walls. Probably a depauperated variety.\r\n\r\n_Var._ ACERVULINA.--In oval or rounded masses, wholly acervuline. Cells\r\nrounded; intermediate skeleton absent or much reduced; cell-walls\r\ntubulated. This may be a distinct species, but it closely resembles the\r\nacervuline parts of the ordinary form.\r\n\r\n\r\nEozoon Bavaricum, _Gümbel_.\r\n\r\nComposed of small acervuline chambers, separated by contorted walls,\r\nand associated with broad plate-like chambers below. Large canals\r\nin the thicker parts of the intermediate skeleton. Differs from _E.\r\nCanadense_ in its smaller and more contorted chambers. Age probably\r\nHuronian.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus_ ARCHÆOSPHERINA.\r\n\r\nA provisional genus, to include rounded solitary chambers, or\r\nglobigerine assemblages of such chambers, with the cell-wall\r\nsurrounding them tubulated as in Eozoon. They may be distinct\r\norganisms, or gemmæ or detached fragments of Eozoon. Some of them\r\nmuch resemble the bodies figured by Dr. Carpenter, as gemmæ or ova\r\nand primitive chambers of Orbitolites. They are very abundant on some\r\nof the strata surfaces of the limestone at Côte St. Pierre. Age Lower\r\nLaurentian.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC POSITION OF EOZOON.\r\n\r\nThe unsettled condition of the classification of the Protozoa, and our\r\nabsolute ignorance of the animal matter of Eozoon, render it difficult\r\nto make any statement on this subject more definite than the somewhat\r\nvague intimations given in the text. My own views at present, based on\r\nthe study of recent and fossil forms, and of the writings of Carpenter,\r\nMax Schultze, Carter, Wallich, Haeckel, and Clarepede, may be stated,\r\nthough with some diffidence, as follows:--\r\n\r\nI. The class _Rhizopoda_ includes all the sarcodous animals whose only\r\nexternal organs are pseudopodia, and is the lowest class in the animal\r\nkingdom. Immediately above it are the classes of the Sponges and of the\r\nflagellate and ciliate Infusoria, which rise from it like two diverging\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nII. The group of Rhizopods, as thus defined, includes three leading\r\n_orders_, which, in descending grade, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) _Lobosa_, or Amœboid Rhizopods, including those with\r\n            distinct nucleus and pulsating vesicle, and thick lobulate\r\n            pseudopodia--naked, or in membranous coverings.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) _Radiolaria_, or Polycistius and their allies, including\r\n            those with thread-like pseudopodia, with or without a\r\n            nucleus, and with the skeleton, when present, silicious.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) _Reticularia_, or Foraminifera and their allies, including\r\n            those with thread-like and reticulating pseudopodia, with\r\n            granular matter instead of a nucleus, and with calcareous,\r\n            membranous, or arenaceous skeletons.\r\n\r\nThe place of _Eozoon_ will be in the lowest order, _Reticularia_.\r\n\r\nIII. The order _Reticularia_ may be farther divided into two\r\n_sub-orders_, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) _Perforata_--having calcareous skeletons penetrated with\r\n            pores.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) _Imperforata_--having calcareous, membranous, or arenaceous\r\n            skeletons, without pores.\r\n\r\nThe place of Eozoon will be in the higher sub-order, _Perforata_.\r\n\r\nIV. The sub-order _Perforata_ includes three _families_--the\r\n_Nummulinidæ_, _Globigerinidæ_, and _Lagemdæ_. Of these Carpenter\r\nregards the Nummulinidæ as the highest in rank.\r\n\r\nThe place of Eozoon will be in the family _Nummulinidæ_, or between\r\nthis and the next family. This oldest known Protozoon would thus belong\r\nto the highest family in the highest sub-order of the lowest class of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LATE SIR WILLIAM E. LOGAN.\r\n\r\nWhen writing the dedication of this work, I little thought that the\r\neminent geologist and valued friend to whom it gave me so much pleasure\r\nto tender this tribute of respect, would have passed away before its\r\npublication. But so it is, and we have now to mourn, not only Lyell,\r\nwho so frankly accepted the evidence in favour of Eozoon, but Logan,\r\nwho so boldly from the first maintained its true nature as a fossil.\r\nThis boldness on his part is the more remarkable and impressive, from\r\nthe extreme caution by which he was characterized, and which induced\r\nhim to take the most scrupulous pains to verify every new fact before\r\ncommitting himself to it. Though Sir William's early work in the Welsh\r\ncoal-fields, his organization and management of the Survey of Canada,\r\nand his reducing to order for the first time all the widely extended\r\nPalæozoic formations of that great country, must always constitute\r\nleading elements in his reputation, I think that in nothing does he\r\ndeserve greater credit than in the skill and genius with which he\r\nattacked the difficult problem of the Laurentian rocks, unravelled\r\ntheir intricacies, and ascertained their true nature as sediments, and\r\nthe leading facts of their arrangement and distribution. The discovery\r\nof Eozoon was one of the results of this great work; and it was the\r\nfirm conviction to which Sir William had attained of the sedimentary\r\ncharacter of the rocks, which rendered his mind open to the evidence of\r\nthese contained fossils, and induced him even to expect the discovery\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThis would not be the proper place to dwell on the general character\r\nand work of Sir William Logan, but I cannot close without referring to\r\nhis untiring industry, his enthusiasm in the investigation of nature,\r\nhis cheerful and single-hearted disposition, his earnest public spirit\r\nand patriotism--qualities which won for him the regard even of those\r\nwho could little appreciate the details of his work, and which did much\r\nto enable him to attain to the success which he achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acervuline explained, 66.\r\n\r\n  Acervuline Variety of Eozoon, 135.\r\n\r\n  Aggregative Growth of Animals, 213.\r\n\r\n  Aker Limestone, 197.\r\n\r\n  Amity Limestone, 197.\r\n\r\n  Amœba described, 59.\r\n\r\n  Annelid Burrows, 133, 139.\r\n\r\n  Archæospherinæ, 137, 148.\r\n\r\n  Archæocyathus, 151.\r\n\r\n  Arisaig, Supposed Eozoon of, 140.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bathybius, 65.\r\n\r\n  Bavaria, Eozoon of, 148.\r\n\r\n  Beginning of Life, 215.\r\n\r\n  Billings, Mr.,--referred to, 41;\r\n      on Archæocyathus, 151;\r\n      on Receptaculites, 163.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Calumet, Eozoon of, 38.\r\n\r\n  Calcarina, 74.\r\n\r\n  Calcite filling Tubes of Eozoon, 98.\r\n\r\n  Canal System of Eozoon, 40, 66, 107, 176, 181.\r\n\r\n  Carpenter--referred to, 41;\r\n      on Eozoon, 82;\r\n    Reply to Carter, 204.\r\n\r\n  Caunopora, 158.\r\n\r\n  Chrysotile Veins, 107, 180.\r\n\r\n  Chemistry of Eozoon, 199.\r\n\r\n  Coccoliths, 70.\r\n\r\n  Cœnostroma, 158.\r\n\r\n  Contemporaries of Eozoon, 127.\r\n\r\n  Côte St. Pierre, 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Derivation applied to Eozoon, 225.\r\n\r\n  Discovery of Eozoon, 35.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Eozoic Time, 7.\r\n\r\n  Eozoon,--Discovery of, 35;\r\n    Structure of, 65;\r\n    Growth of, 70;\r\n    Fragments of, 74;\r\n    Description of, 65, 77 (also Appendix);\r\n    Note on by Dr. Carpenter, 82;\r\n    Thickened Walls of, 66;\r\n    Preservation of, 100;\r\n    Pores filled with Calcite, 97, 109;\r\n      with Pyroxene, 108;\r\n      with Serpentine, 101;\r\n      with Dolomite, 109;\r\n      in Limestone, 110;\r\n    Defective Specimens of, 113;\r\n      how Mineralized, 102, 116;\r\n      its Contemporaries, 127;\r\n    Acervuline Variety of, 135;\r\n    Variety _Minor_ of, 135;\r\n    Acadianum, 140;\r\n    Bavaricum, 148;\r\n    Localities of, 166;\r\n    Harmony of with other Fossils, 171;\r\n    Summary of evidence relating to, 176.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Faulted Eozoon, 182.\r\n\r\n  Foraminifera, Notice of, 61.\r\n\r\n  Fossils, how Mineralized, 93.\r\n\r\n  Fusulina, 74.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Glauconite, 100, 125, 220.\r\n\r\n  Graphite of Laurentian, 18, 27.\r\n\r\n  Green-sand, 99.\r\n\r\n  Grenville, Eozoon of, 38.\r\n\r\n  Gümbel on Laurentian Fossils, 124;\r\n      on Eozoon Bavaricum, 141.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hastings, Rocks of, 57.\r\n\r\n  History of Discovery of Eozoon, 35.\r\n\r\n  Honeyman, Dr., referred to, 140.\r\n\r\n  Hunt, Dr. Sterry, referred to, 35;\r\n      on Mineralization of Eozoon, 115;\r\n      on Silurian Fossils infiltrated with Silicates, 121;\r\n      on Minerals of the Laurentian, 123;\r\n      on Laurentian Life, 27;\r\n      his Reply to Objections, 199.\r\n\r\n  Huronian Rocks, 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Intermediate Skeleton, 64.\r\n\r\n  Iron Ores of Laurentian, 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jones, Prof. T.
