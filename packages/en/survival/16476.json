But the publication of \"The Rover Boys at\r\nSchool,\" \"The Rover Boys on the Ocean,\" and \"The Rover Boys in the\r\nJungle,\" immediately called for more stories of the same sort, so\r\nyear after year I have followed with \"The Rover Boys out West,\" \"The\r\nRover Boys on the Great Lakes,\" \"The Rover Boys in the Mountains,\"\r\nand now the volume before you, which relates the adventures of the\r\nthree brothers, and some of their friends and enemies, on the sea\r\nand on a number of far away islands, where, for a time, all lead a\r\nsort of Robinson Crusoe life.\r\n\r\nIn writing this tale I had in mind not alone to please my young\r\nreaders, but also to give them a fair picture of life on the ocean\r\nas it is to-day, in distinction to what it was years ago, and also\r\nto acquaint the boys and girls with some of the beauties of those\r\nmid-ocean lands which are generally, so strange to all of us. The\r\nboys see much that is new, novel, and pleasing--new fruits, new\r\nflowers, new animals--and have often to use their wits to the utmost,\r\nto get themselves out of serious difficulty and also to make\r\nthemselves, and those under their protection, comfortable.\r\n\r\nOnce again I thank my young friends for the interest they have shown\r\nin my previous stories. I trust that all who peruse this volume will\r\nfind it equally to their liking.\r\n\r\nAffectionately and sincerely yours, ARTHUR M. WINFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROVER BOYS ON LAND AND SEA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE ROVER BOYS IN SAN FRANCISCO\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, Dick, here we are in San Francisco at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Tom, and what a fine large city it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to take care, or we'll get lost,\" came from a third boy,\r\nthe youngest of the party.\r\n\r\n\"Just listen to Sam!\" cried Tom Rover. \"Get lost! As if we weren't\r\nin the habit of taking care of ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam is joking,\" came from Dick Rover. \"Still we might get lost here\r\nas well as in New York or any other large city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boston is the place to get lost in,\" said Tom Rover. \"Got streets\r\nthat curve in all directions. But let us go on. Where is the hotel?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" came from Sam Rover.\r\n\r\n\"Cab! carriage! coupe!\" bawled a cabman standing near. \"Take you\r\nanywhere you want to go, gents.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much to take the three of us to the Oakland House?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take you there for a dollar, trunks and all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go you,\" answered Dick Rover. \"Come on, I'll see that you get\r\nthe right trunks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we are going to have some good times while we are on the\r\nPacific coast,\" observed Tom Rover, while he and Sam were waiting\r\nfor Dick and the cabman to return.\r\n\r\n\"I shan't object to a good time,\" replied Sam. \"That is what we came\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before we go back I am going to have a sail up and down the coast.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, Tom. Perhaps we can sail down to Santa Barbara. That is\r\na sort of Asbury Park and Coney Island combined, so I have been told.\"\r\n\r\nDick Rover and the cabman soon returned. The trunks were piled on\r\nthe carriage and the boys got in, and away they bowled from the\r\nstation in the direction of the Oakland House.\r\n\r\nIt was about ten o'clock of a clear day in early spring. The boys\r\nhad reached San Francisco a few minutes before, taking in the sights\r\non the way. Now they sat up in the carriage taking in more sights,\r\nas the turnout moved along first one street and then another.\r\n\r\nAs old readers of this series know, the Rover boys were three in\r\nnumber, Dick being the oldest, fun-loving Tom next, and sturdy-hearted\r\nSam the youngest. They were the only offspring of Anderson Rover,\r\na former traveler and mine-owner, who, at present, was living with\r\nhis brother Randolph and his sister-in-law Martha, on their beautiful\r\nfarm at Valley Brook, in the heart of New York State.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years the Rover boys had had numerous adventures,\r\nso many, in fact, that they can scarcely be hinted at here. While\r\ntheir father was in the heart of Africa, their Uncle Randolph had\r\nsent them off to Putnam Hall Academy. Here they had made many friends\r\namong the boys and also among some folks living in the vicinity,\r\nincluding Mrs. Stanhope and her daughter Dora, a girl who, according\r\nto Dick Rover's idea, was the sweetest creature in the whole world.\r\nThey had also made some enemies, the worst of the number being Dan\r\nBaxter, a fellow who had been the bully of the school, but who was\r\nnow a homeless wanderer on the face of the earth. Baxter came from\r\na disreputable family, his father having at one time tried to swindle\r\nMr. Rover out of a rich gold mine in the West. The elder Baxter was\r\nnow in prison suffering the penalty for various crimes.\r\n\r\nA term at school had been followed by an exciting chase on the ocean,\r\nand then by a trip through the jungle of Africa, whence the Rover\r\nboys had gone to find their long-lost father. After this the boys\r\nmade a trip West to establish their parent's claim to the gold mine\r\njust mentioned, and this was followed by a grand trip on the Great\r\nLakes in which the boys suffered not a little at the hands of the\r\nBaxters. On an island on one of the lakes the Rover boys found a\r\ncurious casket and this, on being opened, proved to contain some\r\ndirections for locating a treasure secreted in the heart of the\r\nAdirondack Mountains.\r\n\r\n\"We must locate that treasure,\" said Tom Rover, and off they started\r\nfor the mountains, and did locate it at last, but not before Dan\r\nBaxter had done everything in his power to locate it ahead of them.\r\nWhen they finally outwitted their enemy, Dan Baxter had disappeared,\r\nand that was the last they had seen of him for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Rover boys had expected to return to Putnam Hall and their studies\r\nimmediately after the winter outing in the Adirondacks, but an\r\nunexpected happening at the institution of learning made them change\r\ntheir plans. Three pupils were taken down with scarlet fever, and\r\nrather than run the risk of having more taken sick, Captain Victor\r\nPutnam had closed up the Academy for the time being, and sent the\r\npupils to their homes.\r\n\r\n\"The boys will have to go to some other school,\" their Aunt Martha\r\nhad said, but one and another had murmured at this, for they loved\r\nCaptain Putnam too well to desert him so quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Let us wait a few months,\" had been Dick's suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"Let us study at home,\" had come from Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Let us travel,\" Tom had put in. \"Travel broadens the mind.\" He loved\r\nto be \"on the go\" all the time.\r\n\r\nThe matter was talked over for several days, and Tom begged that they\r\nmight take a trip across the continent and back, using some of the\r\nmoney derived from the old treasure. At last Anderson Rover consented;\r\nand two days later the three boys were off, going by way of New York\r\nCity, on the Chicago Limited. They had spent two days in the great\r\ncity by the lakes, and then come direct to the Golden Gate city.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if we will meet anybody we know while we are out here,\"\r\nsaid Tom, as the carriage continued on its way.\r\n\r\n\"If we get down to Santa Barbara I think we'll meet somebody,\" answered\r\nDick, and he blushed just a trifle. \"I got a letter in Chicago, as\r\nyou know. It was from Dora Stanhope, and she said that she and her\r\nmother were traveling again and expected to go either to Santa Barbara\r\nor Los Angeles. Her mother is not well again, and the doctor thought\r\nthe air on the Pacific coast might benefit her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my, but won't Dick have an elegant time, if he falls in with\r\nDora!\" cried Sam. \"Tom, we won't be in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't you start to tease me,\" returned Dick, his face redder\r\nthan ever. \"I guess Dora always gave you a good time, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, she did,\" said Tom. And then he added: \"Did she say\r\nanything about the Lanings?\" For the Laning girls, Nellie and Grace,\r\nwere cousins to Dora Stanhope, and Tom and Sam thought almost as much\r\nof them as Dick did of Dora.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure she did,\" replied Dick. \"But I guess it's--well, it's a\r\nsecret.\"\r\n\r\n\"A secret!\" shouted Sam. \"Not much, Dick! Let us in on it at once!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do!\" put in Tom.\r\n\r\n\"But it may prove a disappointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll chance it,\" returned Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Well then, Dora wrote that if she and her mother could find a nice\r\ncottage at Los Angeles or Santa Barbara they were going to invite\r\nNellie and Grace to come out and keep house with them for six months\r\nor so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Sam enthusiastically. \"I hope they come. If they do,\r\nwon't the six of us just have boss times!\" And his face glowed with\r\nanticipation.\r\n\r\n\"We can certainly have good times if Mrs. Stanhope's health will\r\npermit,\" said Dick. \"Here we are at the hotel.\"\r\n\r\nHe uttered the last words as the carriage came to a stop at the curb.\r\nHe leaped out and so did the others; and a few minutes later found\r\nthem safe and sound in the hotel. They were assigned to a large room\r\non the third floor, and hither they made their way, followed by their\r\ntrunks, and then began to wash and dress up, preparatory to going\r\ndown to the dining room, for the journeying around since breakfast\r\nhad made them hungry.\r\n\r\n\"I think I am going to like San Francisco,\" said Tom, as he was\r\nadjusting a fresh collar and gazing out of the window at the same\r\ntime. \"Everything looks so bright and clean.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have some pretty tall buildings here, the same as in Chicago\r\nand New York,\" came from Dick, as he, too, gazed out of the window.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, all the big cities are a good deal alike,\" put in Sam, who was\r\ndrying his face on a towel.\r\n\r\n\"San Francisco is a mighty rich place,\" continued Tom. \"They are too\r\nrich even to use pennies. It's five cents here, or a bit there, or\r\ntwo bits for this and two bits for that. I never heard a quarter\r\ncalled two bits in New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been told that is a Southern expression, and one used in the\r\nWest Indies,\" said Dick. \"The early Californians--My gracious!\"\r\n\r\nDick broke off short and leaned far out of the window, which they\r\nhad opened to let in the fresh spring air.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" queried Tom. \"Don't fall out.\" And he caught his elder\r\nbrother by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"I must have been mistaken. But it did look like him,\" said Dick slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Look like whom?\" asked Sam, joining the pair.\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter! Here?\" shouted the others.\r\n\r\n\"I am pretty sure it was Dan Baxter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"He is gone now--he just disappeared around the hotel corner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if it really was Dan Baxter, we want to keep our eyes open,\"\r\nwas Sam's comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE TURNING UP OF DAN BAXTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boys were very curious concerning their old enemy, and on going\r\nbelow took a walk around several squares in the vicinity, in the hope\r\nof meeting the individual who had attracted Dick's attention.\r\n\r\nBut the search proved unsuccessful, and they returned to the hotel\r\nand went to dinner, with a larger appetite than ever.\r\n\r\n\"It would be queer if we met Dan Baxter out here,\" said Tom, while\r\nthey were eating. \"He seems to get on our heels, no matter where we go.\r\n\r\n\"If he came to San Francisco first, he'll think we have been following\r\nhim up,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"He must have come here before we did,\" said Dick. \"Our arrival\r\ndates back but three hours,\" and he grinned.\r\n\r\nThe meal over the boys took it easy for a couple of hours, and then\r\nprepared to go out and visit half a dozen points of interest and also\r\npurchase tickets for a performance at one of the leading theaters in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\nAs they crossed the lobby of the hotel they almost ran into a big,\r\nburly young fellow who was coming in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter!\" ejaculated Dick. \"Then I was right after all.\"\r\n\r\nThe burly young fellow stared first at Dick and then the others in\r\nblank amazement. He carried a dress-suit case, and this dropped from\r\nhis hand to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Whe--where did yo--you come from?\" he stammered at last.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we can ask the same question,\" said Tom coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Been following me, have you?\" sneered Dan Baxter, making an effort\r\nto recover his self-possession.\r\n\r\n\"No, we haven't been following you,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing you tell us how it happens that you are here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you tell us how it happens that you are here,\" came from Dick.\r\n\r\n\"That is my business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our business is our own, too, Dan Baxter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You followed me,\" growled the big bully, his face darkening. \"I know\r\nyou and don't you forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should we follow you?\" said Tom. \"We got the best of you over\r\nthat treasure in the Adirondacks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you needn't blow. Remember the old saying, 'He laughs best who\r\nlaughs last.' I aint done with you yet--not by a long shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let me warn you to keep your distance,\" said Dick sternly.\r\n\"If you don't, you'll regret it. We have been very easy with you in\r\nthe past, but if you go too far, I, for one, will be for putting you\r\nwhere your father is, in prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I say the same,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Ditto here,\" came from Sam.\r\n\r\nAt these words a look of bitter hatred crossed Dan Baxter's face. He\r\nclenched his fists and breathed hard.\r\n\r\n\"You can brag when you are three to one,\" he cried fiercely. \"But\r\nwait, that's all. My father would be a free man if it wasn't for you.\r\nWait, and see what I do!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so speaking he caught up his dress-suit case, swung around on\r\nhis heel, and left the hotel before anybody could stop him.\r\n\r\n\"He's the same old Baxter,\" said Tom, with a long sigh. \"Always going\r\nto square up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he is more vindictive than he used to be,\" observed Sam.\r\n\"When Dick spoke about his father being in prison he looked as if he\r\nwould like to strangle the lot of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I admit it would be rough on any ordinary boy to mention the\r\nfact that his father was in prison,\" said Dick. \"But we all know,\r\nand Dan Baxter himself knows, that one is about as wicked as the\r\nother. The only thing that makes Arnold Baxter's case worse is that\r\nhe is old enough to know better.\"\r\n\r\n\"So is Dan old enough to know better,\" was Tom's comment.\r\n\r\n\"I believe he was coming here to get accommodations,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"If he was, that would tend to prove that he had just arrived in San\r\nFrancisco, Dick.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. But he may have been in this vicinity, perhaps in Oakland,\r\nAlameda, or some other nearby town.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose could have brought him here?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a conundrum. Maybe he thought the East was getting too hot\r\nto hold him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we knew where he was going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see if we can follow him up.\"\r\n\r\nBut to follow Dan Baxter up was out of the question, as they speedily\r\ndiscovered when they stepped out on the sidewalk. People were hurrying\r\nin all directions, and the bully had been completely swallowed up in\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\n\"We must watch out,\" said Dick. \"Now he knows we are here he will\r\ntry to do us harm, mark my words.\"\r\n\r\nThe walk that afternoon proved full of interest, and in the evening\r\nthey went to see a performance of a light opera at the Columbia\r\nTheater. The performance gave them a good deal of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Quarter past eleven!\" exclaimed Dick, when they were coming away.\r\n\"That's the time we got our money's worth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it must be late,\" said Tom. \"I was getting hungry. Let us\r\nget a bite of something before we go back to the hotel.\"\r\n\r\nThe others were willing, and they entered a nearby restaurant and\r\nseated themselves at one of the tables. As they did this, a person\r\nwho had been following them stopped at the door to peer in after\r\nthem. The person was Dan Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"They are going to dine before retiring,\" he muttered to himself.\r\n\"The Old Nick take the luck! They have all the good times, while I\r\nhave only the bad!\"\r\n\r\nDan Baxter had followed the boys from the hotel to the theater and\r\nhad also waited around for them to come out. He wanted to \"square\r\nup\" with them, but had no definite plan of action, and was trusting\r\nto luck for something to turn up in his favor.\r\n\r\nHe had drifted to the West for a double reason. The one was, as the\r\nboys had surmised, because the East seemed to be getting too hot to\r\nhold him. His second reason was that he hoped to get passage on some\r\nvessel bound for Sydney, Australia. He had a distant relative in\r\nAustralia, and thought that if he could only see that relative\r\npersonally he might be able to get some money. He was nearly out of\r\nfunds, and so far the relative, although rich, had refused to send\r\nany money by mail or express.\r\n\r\n\"They have everything they want, while I have nothing,\" he went on\r\nsavagely. \"And they don't deserve it, either. Oh, how I wish I could\r\nwring their necks for 'em!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly an idea struck him and without waiting for the boys to come\r\nout of the restaurant he hopped on board of a street car running in\r\nthe direction of the Oakland House. Entering the hotel office he\r\nasked to look at the register.\r\n\r\n\"Room 324,\" he said to himself. \"That is on the third floor, I suppose,\r\nsince they generally start a new hundred for every floor. Wonder if\r\nI can get up without being noticed?\"\r\n\r\nHe watched his chance, and slipping past the bell boys, made his way\r\nup the stairs, which, on account of the elevators, were but little\r\nused. In a few minutes he was in front of the door to Room 324. He\r\ntried it cautiously, to find it locked.\r\n\r\n\"Now if only the keys will work,\" he muttered, breathing hard, and\r\ntaking a bunch of keys from his pocket he tried them, one after another.\r\n\r\nHe had tried four keys without success, when he saw a waiter approaching\r\nwith a trayful of good things for a late supper in a nearby apartment.\r\nAt once he moved away down the hallway and did not return until the\r\nservant had disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nHe had five other keys and the third fitted the lock, although rather\r\ncrudely; so crudely in fact that once the lock bolt was turned the\r\nkey could not be withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\"That's bad,\" he thought. \"But as it cannot be helped I'll have to\r\nmake the best of it. I mustn't stay here too long,\" and going into\r\nthe room he closed the door after him.\r\n\r\nThere was a faint light burning at one of the gas jets and this he\r\nturned up, and pulled down the shades of the windows. Then he gazed\r\nswiftly around the large room, noting the boys' trunks and traveling\r\nbags and several articles of wearing apparel scattered about.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if only I can find what I am after,\" he muttered. \"But more than\r\nlikely they carry their money with them, or else they left it at the\r\nhotel office.\"\r\n\r\nAll of the trunks and traveling bags were locked, and to force the\r\ntrunks open seemed at first impossible. One of the traveling bags\r\nwas slit open with a sharp pocket-knife the bully carried and the\r\ncontents emptied on one of the beds.\r\n\r\n\"Not much that I want,\" muttered Dan Baxter, as he gazed at the\r\ncollection. Then a jewel case caught his eye and he opened it. \"A\r\ndiamond stud and a diamond scarf pin! Not so bad, after all!\" And he\r\ntransferred the jewelry to his pocket.\r\n\r\nA second later he came upon a bunch of keys. They proved to belong\r\nto the trunks and bags, and soon he had the trunks open and the\r\ncontents scattered in all directions. Then he went down on his knees,\r\nexamining everything brought to light.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that he was in a fever of excitement. The Rover\r\nboys might return at any moment, and he knew full well that to be\r\ncaught would mean a term in prison. He kept his ears on the alert\r\nwhile his heart thumped loudly within his bosom.\r\n\r\n\"A pocketbook at last!\" he cried softly, and snatched it up. One look\r\nshowed him a, small pile of five and ten-dollar bills, exactly two\r\nhundred and seventy-five dollars in all. Then he found another jewel\r\ncase, and from it extracted a second diamond stud and a pair of very\r\nfine cuff buttons.\r\n\r\n\"That is all I guess I can get,\" he muttered, as he stood up. \"But\r\nI might as well take a new outfit while I am at it,\" he added, and\r\npicked up several articles of wearing apparel. These he stuffed in\r\none of the bags which had not been cut, and around it put a small strap.\r\n\r\nTiptoeing his way to the door, he opened it and listened. Nobody was\r\nwithin hearing or sight. But as he stepped out, the waiter he had\r\nbefore seen came once more into view, this time carrying a tray with\r\nsome bottles and a box of cigars. The waiter eyed him curiously again,\r\nbut said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Too bad he saw me, but it can't be helped,\" thought Dan Baxter, and\r\nmade his way downstairs with all possible speed. Once in the lower\r\nhall he lost no time in gaining the street. In another moment he was\r\nswallowed up in the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA DISCOVERY AND WHAT FOLLOWED\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, what does this mean? Here is a key in the door.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Dick Rover who spoke. He stood in the hallway of the hotel,\r\nand beside him were Tom and Sam. They had eaten rather heartily at\r\nthe restaurant and taken more time than they had anticipated.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't leave the key there,\" came from Tom. \"Here it is,\" and he\r\nbrought it out of his pocket. \"I meant to leave it at the desk, but\r\nit slipped my mind.\"\r\n\r\nDick found the door open and walked into the room, followed by his\r\nbrothers. Baxter had extinguished the gas and they stood in the dark\r\nuntil Sam found a match and lit up. Then a cry went up from all three:\r\n\r\n\"We have been robbed!\"\r\n\r\n\"This is some sneak thief's work,\" came from Dick. \"Run down and tell\r\nthe hotel clerk at once.\"\r\n\r\nTom bolted from the room and went down the stairs three steps at a\r\ntime. The clerk sat dozing in his chair and was roused up with\r\ndifficulty. But as soon as he realized that something was wrong he\r\nwas wide-awake.\r\n\r\n\"A robbery, eh?\" he queried. \"What have you lost?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got to find that out,\" answered Tom.\r\n\r\nIn less than a quarter of an hour they knew the extent of their\r\nloss--three diamonds and a pair of cuff buttons, in all worth over\r\ntwo hundred dollars, and two hundred and seventy-five dollars in\r\ncash--not to mention a ruined valise and one missing, and the loss\r\nof a light overcoat, some silk handkerchiefs and some underwear.\r\n\r\n\"A total loss of over five hundred dollars,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\nAt this the hotel clerk gave a long whistle. \"As much as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"We must get on the track of the thief, and without delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon I know the thief,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"You think it was Dan Baxter?\" questioned his elder brother.\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right. But there is no proof that he did it.\"\r\n\r\nThe hotel clerk found the windows closed and locked.\r\n\r\n\"The thief came in and went out by the door,\" he said. \"The hall boys\r\nor somebody else must have seen him. This key is stuck in the lock,\r\nwhich proves that it is not a regular hotel key.\"\r\n\r\nWithout delay the story of the robbery was telephoned to the nearest\r\npolice station, and soon two detectives appeared. By this time some\r\nof the servants noticed that something was wrong, and the waiter who\r\nhad seen Dan Baxter come in and go out told his story, to which the\r\nboys, the hotel clerk, and the detectives listened with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us just how that fellow looked,\" said Dick, and the waiter gave\r\na very good description of the person he had seen.\r\n\r\n\"I imagine Sam is right,\" said Dick. \"If it wasn't Dan Baxter it was\r\nhis double.\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this the hotel clerk and the detectives insisted upon\r\nknowing who Dan Baxter was, and the boys told as much of the bully\r\nas they deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, if he is guilty the chances are that he will leave San\r\nFrancisco as soon as possible,\" said one of the detectives. \"The best\r\nwe can do is to try to head him off.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we'll do our best to find him, too,\" added Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I think the hotel ought to be responsible for this robbery,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't leave your key at the desk when you went out,\" cried the\r\nhotel clerk, struck by a sudden idea.\r\n\r\n\"What of that?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"That makes the guest responsible.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried Tom, aghast.\r\n\r\n\"We are responsible only when the key is left at the desk. And jewels\r\nmust be left for keeping in one of our safes,\" went on the clerk.\r\n\"There are our rules,\" and he pointed to the printed form tacked on\r\nthe inside of the door.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let us talk about that just now,\" said one of the detectives.\r\n\"I think we can get hold of this thief, and if we are quick about it\r\nwe'll get everything he took, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter was talked over for a quarter of an hour longer and then\r\nthe detectives went off to make their report and to follow on the\r\ntrail of Dan Baxter, if such a thing was possible.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that the three Rover boys slept but little that\r\nnight. The loss of the cash was something of a serious matter to\r\nthem, even though they still possessed a hundred odd dollars in cash\r\nbetween them, and could easily telegraph home for more. More than\r\nthis, the diamonds and cuff buttons had been gifts of which they were\r\nvery proud.\r\n\r\n\"And to think that Dan Baxter should get them,\" said Tom. \"I wouldn't\r\nfeel half so bitter if it had been just some ordinary sneak thief.\"\r\nAnd the others said the same.\r\n\r\nTwo days went by and nothing was learned concerning Dan Baxter further\r\nthan that he had put up at the Montgomery Hotel for one night and\r\nhad left early in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"He is hundreds of miles away from here by this time,\" said Dick sadly.\r\n\r\n\"He said he would get square, and I guess he has done it,\" returned Tom.\r\n\r\nBut Dan Baxter had not gotten as far as they supposed. He was in\r\nhiding in Oakland, across the bay, having pawned the diamonds at a\r\npawn-broker's of shady reputation for seventy-five dollars. This gave\r\nhim three hundred and fifty dollars in cash, which made him, for the\r\ntime being, feel quite rich.\r\n\r\nBut he was afraid to take a train to some other town, and so remained\r\nin the boarding house for nearly a week, under the assumed name of\r\nRobert Brown.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fifth day Dan Baxter became acquainted with a\r\nseafaring man named Jack Lesher. Lesher was a rough fellow, who had\r\nsailed to many ports on the Pacific Ocean. He had now obtained the\r\nposition of first mate on a large schooner which was to sail in a\r\nfew days from San Francisco to several ports in Australia.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to go on that trip to Australia,\" said Baxter, thinking of\r\nhis distant relative. \"Do you want a passenger?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see about it, my hearty,\" replied Jack Lesher, and on the\r\nfollowing day said that Captain Blossom would take him for an even\r\nhundred dollars. A bargain was struck at once, and Dan Baxter went\r\non board of the schooner _Golden Wave_ that afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad I am out of it,\" he told himself, when snug on board of\r\nthe craft. \"I'll get to Australia after all, and I'm considerably\r\nricher than I thought I would be. More than that, I've got in on\r\nthose Rover boys in a way they won't forget in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the detectives looked for the thief, the boys had small heart\r\nto go sight-seeing. Every time they, went out they looked for Dan Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"If only I could meet him!\" cried Tom. \"Oh, but wouldn't I just punch\r\nhim good before I passed him over to a policeman.\"\r\n\r\nDuring those days the lads received several letters from home, and\r\nalso three communications from the Stanhopes and the Lanings.\r\n\r\n\"The Stanhopes have gone to Santa Barbara,\" announced Dick, after\r\nperusing an epistle from Dora. \"And she says her mother is slightly\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nellie Laning is coming out, and so is Grace,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"When?\" questioned Dick.\r\n\r\n\"They have already started, according to the letter I have,\" put in\r\nSam. \"Boys, I think we can have just the jolliest time ever was when\r\nthe girls are all together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are,\" came from Tom. \"What a pity we had to have that\r\nrobbery to darken our fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to let it darken my fun,\" said Dick. \"Don't worry\r\nbut what some day we'll get the best of Dan Baxter. That stolen stuff\r\nwill never do him much good.\"\r\n\r\nThe very next morning came word from the detectives. One of them\r\ncalled at the hotel.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid the case is queered,\" said he. \"We tracked the rascal\r\nto Oakland, and now it looks as if he had given us the slip for good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you find any trace of him?\" questioned Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! but he has shipped on a vessel which is bound for Australia,\r\nand as she is already two days out of port he is out of our reach.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are certain he went on that vessel?\" cried Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He went as a passenger, under the name of Robert Brown.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did he take the jewels and money with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than likely. At any rate, we can find no trace of the jewels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that chase is done for,\" said Dick, \"and we shall have to pocket\r\nour loss.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective was chagrined to think that he had tracked Dan Baxter\r\nonly to lose him, and promised to see if anything more could be done\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\nBut nothing could be done, as there was no telling when the Golden\r\nWave would arrive at Australia, and what port the craft would first make.\r\n\r\n\"We have seen the last of Dan Baxter,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\nBut the youngest Rover was mistaken. They were to meet the bully\r\nagain, and under circumstances as astonishing as they were perilous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nGOOD TIMES AT SANTA BARBARA\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What a land of plenty!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Tom who made the remark.\r\n\r\nThe Rover boys were on their way to Santa Barbara, after having spent\r\nthree weeks at San Francisco and vicinity. They had received word\r\nthat Dora Stanhope and her mother and the two Laning girls were at\r\nthe fashionable watering place, and they were anxious to meet their\r\nold friends.\r\n\r\nOn sped the luxurious train, over hills and through the valleys, past\r\nheavy woodlands and by rich fruit farms. It was a scene which interested\r\nthem greatly, and they never tired of sitting at the windows, gazing out.\r\n\r\nPresently the car door opened and a tall young fellow, carrying a\r\nvalise, stepped inside and walked down the aisle. As he came closer\r\nDick Rover leaped up.\r\n\r\n\"Bob Sutter!\" he cried, with a smile of pleasure. \"Who would ever\r\ndream of meeting you out here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it really Dick Rover?\" questioned the newcomer, as he shook hands.\r\n\"And Tom and Sam, too! I must be dreaming. Is Putnam Hall on its\r\ntravels?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are on our travels,\" replied Tom, also shaking hands, followed\r\nby Sam. \"But what are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\nBob Sutter, a former scholar at Putnam Hall, smiled broadly.\r\n\r\n\"I live in California now. My father is interested in real estate in\r\nLos Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara. Our home is in Santa Barbara.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is where we are going,\" came from Sam.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing just traveling around?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; we thought we'd put in time until the Hall opens again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard it had been closed. Too bad! If you are going to Santa\r\nBarbara, you must call and see me by all means,\" went on Bob Sutter.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure we will,\" said Tom, and his brothers nodded.\r\n\r\n\"We were going down there now to call on the Stanhopes,\" said Dick.\r\n\"They have come here for the benefit of Mrs. Stanhope's health,\r\nand Nellie and Grace Laning are with them. I guess you know them all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the Laning girls, and I think I did meet Miss Stanhope once--at\r\na football game. I'll be glad to meet them again. But tell me about\r\nyourselves.\"\r\n\r\nBob Sutter sat down, and soon all were talking at a lively rate. The\r\nnewcomer was astonished to hear of the doings of Dan Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"The Baxters always were a hard crowd,\" he said. \"I hope you'll get\r\nback your stuff some time.\"\r\n\r\nIt was late at night when Santa Barbara was reached, yet many of the\r\nhotels were a blaze of light from top to bottom. At the depot the\r\nRover boys parted with Bob Sutter, but promised to call upon him in\r\na day or two.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a fine yacht,\" said Bob Sutter. \"Some time I want to take\r\nyou for a trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what we were wishing for!\" cried Tom. \"Just name your time,\r\nthat's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"How will next Monday suit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will your yacht hold us?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"The Old Glory will hold ten passengers on a pinch,\" answered Bob Sutter.\r\n\r\n\"Then you don't sail the craft alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can sail her in fair weather. But father makes me take an old\r\nsailor named Jerry Tolman along with me. Jerry is a character--a\r\nregular old salt, and I love to have his company. And that makes me\r\nthink! Why can't we make up a party and go out? You can bring the\r\nthree girls you are going to visit, and I can bring my cousin, Mary\r\nParloe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you are talking!\" shouted Sam. \"What a jolly trip it will be!\"\r\n\r\nThe proposal met with immediate approval, and it was decided that\r\nthe boys should meet not later than Saturday afternoon to complete\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nThe Rover boys had received word that Mrs. Stanhope had rented a\r\nfurnished cottage not far from one of the leading hotels. The lady\r\nwas very nervous, and did not like too much noise and confusion about\r\nher. Meals were brought in from the hotel, which made it very pleasant.\r\n\r\nWhen the three boys drove up in a carriage from the depot, three\r\ngirls came rushing out to greet them. The three were Dora Stanhope\r\nand her two cousins, Nellie and Grace Laning.\r\n\r\n\"So here you are at last!\" cried Dora Stanhope, as she gave Dick's\r\nhand a tight squeeze.\r\n\r\n\"We almost made up our mind you had missed the train,\" said Nellie\r\nLaning to Tom, giving him a bright smile as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"How fine you are looking,\" said Grace to Sam. \"Traveling must agree\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Traveling does agree with us,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"We would have been here sooner, only we stopped to talk to an old\r\nschoolmate,\" said Dick, and then he told about Bob Sutter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I remember Bob Sutter,\" said Nellie. \"We went on a straw-ride\r\ntogether once--before you came to Putnam Hall,\" she added, to Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I know him, too,\" put in Grace. \"He's a nice boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he is,\" said Sam pointedly.\r\n\r\n\"But he isn't as nice as some boys,\" went on Grace in a lower tone,\r\nand giving Sam an arch smile that made him feel very happy.\r\n\r\nThey were soon in the cottage and greeting Mrs. Stanhope, who had\r\nbeen lying on a couch. The lady greeted them in a motherly way that\r\nmade them feel more at home than ever. She thought a great deal of\r\nthe Rover boys, and especially of Dick, and did not object in the\r\nleast to the marked attention Dick bestowed upon her only child. As\r\nmy old readers know, the Rover boys had, in the past, done mother\r\nand daughter more than one valuable service.\r\n\r\nThe boys were fortunate in obtaining rooms in the hotel close to the\r\ncottage, which would make it possible for them to run in and out as\r\nthey pleased.\r\n\r\n\"It's like old times to be together again,\" said Tom, when he and\r\nhis brothers were retiring that night. \"And, as Mrs. Stanhope is\r\nfeeling so well, I guess we can have lots of fun.\"\r\n\r\nAnd fun they did have. There were bathing in the surf, and lawn\r\ntennis, and dancing at the hotel in the evening, and also lovely\r\nwalks and drives, and once they went out on horseback to a large\r\nfruit farm some miles away, and were royally entertained by some of\r\nBob Sutter's friends. Bob Sutter and his cousin, Mary Parloe, went\r\nalong, and proved first-class company.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a trip on Bob's yacht suited everybody, and it was\r\ndecided that the whole party should go out early Monday morning,\r\ntaking old Jerry Tolman with them. They were to load down well with\r\nprovisions and visit not only several points along the coast, but\r\nalso one or two of the islands lying twenty-five to thirty miles\r\nsouth of Santa Barbara.\r\n\r\nThe Rover boys had already inspected the Old Glory and found her to\r\nbe a first-class yacht in every respect. The craft was about sixty\r\nfeet in length and correspondingly broad of beam. She carried a tall\r\nmast, but the lead in her keel was amply sufficient to keep her from\r\ngoing over unless under full sail in a very heavy wind. The cabin\r\nwas fairly large and richly furnished, for the Sutters were a family\r\nof means, and desired everything of the best.\r\n\r\nIf the boys liked the yacht they also liked the man who had charge\r\nof her, bluff and hearty Jerry Tolman--Captain Jerry, as Bob Sutter\r\ncalled him. He was truly an old salt, having sailed the ocean since\r\nhis tenth year, on both whalers and merchantmen. Captain Jerry lacked\r\na book education, but he was naturally shrewd, and far from being a fool.\r\n\r\n\"Downright glad to meet ye, my hearties,\" he said, when the boys were\r\nbrought on board. And he gave each hand a grip like that of iron.\r\n\"Want to look over my lady, eh? Well, she's a putty one to inspect,\r\ntake my word on't.\" And he showed them over the craft with pleasure.\r\nThey found the yacht clean \"as a whistle,\" and each particular bit\r\nof brasswork polished like a mirror.\r\n\r\nBy Saturday evening all was ready for the trip. On Sunday morning\r\nthe Rover boys went to church with the Stanhopes and the Lanings,\r\nand rested in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThey were just about to go to supper, when a note came for Dick. It\r\nwas from Bob Sutter, and ran as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR DICK: My cousin and I have been in an accident. We went\r\ndriving to church this morning and the horse ran away and threw us\r\nboth out on the rocks. Miss Parloe had her collar bone broken, and\r\nI broke my left ankle. Kindly come and see me if you can.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An accident!\" cried Tom. \"That is too bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us all go and see him,\" suggested Sam, and this plan was carried\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThey found that Bob Sutter was resting easily on his bed. The doctor\r\nhad set the broken ankle, and put it in plaster, and he had told Bob\r\nthat he must keep quiet for several weeks.\r\n\r\n\"This ends that yacht trip, so far as I am concerned,\" said Bob ruefully.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, we can wait until you get well,\" said Dick cheerfully,\r\nalthough he did not expect' to remain at Santa Barbara more than ten\r\ndays longer.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't want you to wait,\" answered Bob Sutter. \"My cousin won't\r\nbe well, so they tell me, for several months, and I won't want to go\r\nwithout her. I've been thinking that you had better take the trip\r\nwithout us. Captain Jerry can easily run the yacht with your aid.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very kind of you,\" said Tom. \"But we'd rather have you along.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter was talked over for an hour. The Rover boys knew that\r\nDora, Nellie, and Grace would be sorely disappointed if the yacht\r\ntrip was given up. At last they decided to accept Bob Sutter's kind\r\nsuggestion and make the trip without the company of the young owner\r\nand his cousin; and then they withdrew, wishing Bob a speedy recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nON BOARD OF THE YACHT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What a glorious day for the trip!\"\r\n\r\n\"We are going to turn real sailors, aren't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't I help pull up a sail or something, Tom?\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the remarks of Dora, Nellie, and Grace as they boarded the\r\nOld Glory early on Monday morning.\r\n\r\nThe boys and Captain Jerry were there to receive them, having arrived\r\nan hour before, to see that all the provisions were stowed away, and\r\nthat the craft was in prime condition for sailing. By a curious\r\ncombination of circumstances Bob Sutter had ordered far more provisions\r\nthan were necessary for such a short trip, but Captain Jerry had\r\nfound a place for everything, remarking that they might come in useful\r\nafter all, but never dreaming how useful, as later events were to prove.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanhope had come down in a carriage to see them off. She kissed\r\nall of the girls an affectionate good-by.\r\n\r\n\"Have a good time,\" she said. \"And be sure and come back safe and sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't ye worry but what I'll bring 'em back safe enough, ma'am,\"\r\nsaid Captain Jerry, as he tipped his cap respectfully.\r\n\r\nWhen the girls were safe on board, the boys waved an adieu to Mrs.\r\nStanhope. Then they ranged up in a row in front of old Jerry and each\r\ntouched his forelock and gave a hitch to his trowser leg.\r\n\r\n\"Ready for orders, cap'n,\" they said, in unison, having practiced\r\nthis little by-play in secret.\r\n\r\n\"Wh--what?\" stammered Captain Jerry, gazing at them in bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"Ready for orders, sir,\" they said.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we shake out the mainsail?\" asked Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I hoist the jib?\" came from Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Can I set the topsail, captain?\" put in Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Well, by the son o' Neptune!\" gasped Captain Jerry. \"Got a real,\r\ngenerwine crew, aint I? All right, my hearties, I'll set ye to work\r\nfast enough.\" And then followed a string of orders in true nautical\r\nstyle, and the Rover boys flew in one direction and another to execute\r\nthem. Up went the mainsail and the jib, and the top-sail followed,\r\nand soon the Old Glory was standing off into Santa Barbara Channel,\r\nwith Mrs. Stanhope in the carriage waving them an adieu, and the\r\ngirls and the boys waving their handkerchiefs in return.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was a glorious day, as Dora had said, and after the\r\nsails were set, there was nothing to do but to take it easy on the\r\ncushions of the rail seats. Captain Jerry was at the wheel, but he\r\npromised to let each of them \"take a trick\" in his place before\r\nthe trip should come to an end.\r\n\r\n\"I jest wish we had another yacht to race with,\" said the old sailor.\r\n\"Then I could show ye what sort o' a clean pair o' heels the Old\r\nGlory could show the other craft.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to see the yacht is speedy,\" replied Dick. \"She cuts the\r\nwater like a thing of life. And you know just how to get her best\r\nspeed out of her,\" he went on, a remark that pleased old Jerry very much.\r\n\r\n\"Will we have more breeze, do you think?\" asked Tom, later on, as he\r\nobserved some in clouds to the westward.\r\n\r\n\"Can't say as to that, lad. Those clouds may come this way and they\r\nmay blow north'ard. If they come down here, we'll catch it putty\r\nlively.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like a good, stiff breeze,\" came from Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't run us into a storm,\" cried Grace in alarm. \"We might all\r\nget seasick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" said Dick. \"We are a very long way from a storm,\r\nto my way of thinking.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning passed quickly enough, and at noon they ran into a small\r\nharbor on one of the islands and had dinner in true picnic style. At\r\none o'clock they packed up once more, went on board of the Old Glory,\r\nand stood off to the westward, for all wanted a run \"right on the\r\nocean,\" as Tom expressed it.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jerry was just a bit doubtful of the trip, for the clouds in\r\nthe western sky had grown considerably larger than when first noticed.\r\nNot that he did not think the yacht could weather a blow, but he was\r\nafraid the young ladies would get seasick. However, as he did not\r\nwish to put a damper on their fun, he said nothing, resolved to turn\r\nback at the first sign of any \"inward upsettin',\" as he expressed it.\r\n\r\nThe breeze had increased, and as it was directly from off shore the\r\nOld Glory bowled along merrily over the waves. Nobody showed the\r\nleast sign of seasickness, and they talked, laughed, and sang as if\r\nthey had not a care in the world. Tom also did some fishing, and\r\ncaught a string of the finny tribe, of which he was justly proud.\r\n\r\n\"You can bake them for us when we get back,\" he said to Nellie. \"And\r\nthen we can all have a fish party.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could go on sailing like this for a week,\" said Dick to Dora, as\r\nthey moved forward. \"I mean if you were along with me,\" he added, in\r\na lower tone, and she gave him a look that meant a good deal.\r\n\r\nWhen three o'clock came Captain Jerry announced that they must turn\r\nback. They were far out of sight of land, with nothing but the blue\r\nocean around them. Overhead the sky was still clear, but the clouds\r\non the horizon were rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let us keep on a while longer,\" pleaded Tom. \"This is just\r\nglorious!\" And the others said the same.\r\n\r\nSo they kept on, although somewhat against Captain Jerry's better\r\njudgment. The old sailor was watching the clouds. Presently there\r\ncame an extra heavy puff of wind, and then the clouds seemed to rush\r\nup with lightning-like rapidity.\r\n\r\n\"Got to go back, now,\" said the sailor. \"Going to have a big blow\r\nafore night.\" And he threw over the tiller and gave the necessary\r\ncommands to change the sails.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, but those clouds are coming up fast!\" exclaimed Dick, after\r\na careful survey. \"I ever saw them come up like that on the Atlantic,\r\nor on the Great Lakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's unusual,\" replied Captain Jerry, with a shake of his head.\r\n\"Never seen it afore myself. The wind is coming around, too. It's\r\ngoin' to be a different storm from what we generally git around these\r\nwaters.\"\r\n\r\nThe black clouds soon obscured the sun, and the wind began to blow\r\nstronger than ever, sending the whitecaps rolling over the ocean,\r\nand causing the spray to fly over the deck of the yacht. Nellie\r\nclutched Tom by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom, what does this mean?\" she asked in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n\"It means that we are going to have a storm, that's all,\" he answered\r\nas lightly as he could.\r\n\r\n\"But--but will it hurt us?\" came from Grace.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" put in Sam. \"But we may get wet, unless we go\r\ninto the cabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I vote the girls all go into the cabin,\" said Dick. \"Sam can go with\r\nthem if he wants to. Tom, you and I can stay on deck to look after\r\nthe sails.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to do my duty on deck, too,\" came from Sam promptly.\r\n\r\nAnother rush of wind now sent the spray flying in all directions,\r\nand to keep from being drenched the girls retired to the tiny cabin,\r\nor, rather, cuddy, of which the Old Glory boasted.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure it is going to be an awful storm,\" said Dora. \"I wish we\r\nwere safe on land once more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear! do you think we'll go to the bottom?\" asked Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"The boys won't let the yacht go down,\" answered Dora. \"They are all\r\ngood sailors, and Captain Jerry must know all about handling this\r\ncraft. But we may have a very bad time of it before we get back to\r\nSanta Barbara.\"\r\n\r\nIt was dark in the cabin, but the yacht pitched and plunged so\r\nviolently that they were afraid to light the lantern. So they huddled\r\ntogether, each holding another's hand.\r\n\r\nOn deck Captain Jerry gave orders to lower the topsail and haul in\r\nthe jib. Several reefs were also taken in the mainsail, and the boys\r\nstood ready to bring down the rest of the sheet with a rush at the\r\nfirst word from the old sailor.\r\n\r\n\"It's a re-markable storm--re-markable,\" said Captain Jerry, chewing\r\nvigorously on the quid of tobacco in his cheek. \"Aint never seen no\r\nsech storm here afore. Puts me in mind o' a blow I stood out in onct\r\noff the coast o' Alaska when I was in a whaler. Thet storm caught us\r\nsame time as this an' ripped our mast out in a jiffy and drowned two\r\no' the sailors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope nothing like that happens to us,\" said Dick, with a shudder.\r\nHe was not thinking of himself, but of the three girls in the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Well, lad, it aint goin' to be no easy blow, I kin tell ye that,\"\r\nresponded Captain Jerry.\r\n\r\nSoon the wind began to whistle shrilly through the air, and the sky\r\nbecame so black they could scarcely see a hundred yards in any\r\ndirection, Then came some distant flashes of lightning and rolling\r\nthunder, and soon the patter of rain.\r\n\r\n\"Now we are going to catch it,\" said Tom, and he was right. Ten\r\nminutes later it was pouring in torrents, and the rain continued to\r\nkeep coming down as if there was to be no end of it.\r\n\r\n\"Boys, aren't you most drowned?\" asked Nellie, peeping out of the\r\ncabin door.\r\n\r\n\"No, but you'll be if you come out here,\" called back Tom.\r\n\r\n\"We can't stand up and we can't sit still,\" came from Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, but you'll have to make the best of it,\" answered Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we won't mind, if only we reach shore in safety,\" put in Dora,\r\nand then the door was closed again.\r\n\r\nOn and on swept the Old Glory, through the wind, the rain, and the\r\ndarkness. As there was no land near, Captain Jerry paid his whole\r\nattention to making the yacht ride easily, an almost impossible task\r\nin such a sea as was now raging.\r\n\r\nSuddenly from somewhere out of the air came a humming sound. It grew\r\nlouder and louder, and the boys felt a strange suction of wind which\r\nmade them hold tightly to the rail for fear of being pulled overboard\r\nby some uncanny force. There followed a loud snap and a crash, and\r\nthe mast began to come down.\r\n\r\n\"Look out for the mast!\" screamed Captain Jerry, and all jumped just\r\nin the nick of time. Down came the stick, to strike the rail and\r\nshatter it like a pipe stem, and then lay over the deck and over the\r\nwaves beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nADRIFT ON THE PACIFIC OCEAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The mast has gone by the board!\" screamed Dick, on rising to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"That stick will turn the yacht over!\" gasped Tom.\r\n\r\nPoor Sam could not speak, for a wave had struck him full in the mouth,\r\nand he had all he could do to keep from being washed overboard.\r\n\r\nThe girls in the cabin heard the crash above the roaring of the\r\nelements, and let up a scream of alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Are we going down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we come out on deck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay where ye are!\" shouted back Captain Jerry, clinging to the\r\nwheel with a grip of steel. Then he turned to Dick: \"Can ye git an\r\nax and clear away the wreck?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try it,\" replied the eldest Rover, and he moved cautiously to\r\nwhere an ax rested in a holder. Soon he had the article in hand, and\r\nwas chopping away as fast as he could, while Tom, holding to the\r\nbottom of the mast with one hand, held Dick with the other. Sam, in\r\nthe meantime, cut away some.. cordage with a hatchet which was handy.\r\n\r\nIt was truly a perilous moment, and it looked as if the mighty waves\r\nwould swamp the Old Glory before the wreckage could be cleared away.\r\nThe girls stood at a cabin window watching the work and ready to leap\r\nout if the yacht should start to go down.\r\n\r\n\"There it goes!\" cried Dick, at last, and gave another stroke with\r\nthe ax. There followed a snap and a crack, and overboard slid the\r\nbroken mast, carrying a mass of cordage with it.\r\n\r\nAt once the Old Glory righted herself, sending a small sheet of water\r\nflowing from one side of the deck to the other. Some of the water\r\nswept into the cabin, and the girls were alarmed more than ever.\r\n\r\n\"A good job done that it's overboard,\" said Captain Jerry. \"Another\r\nplunge or two and we would have gone over, sure pop!\"\r\n\r\nWith the wreckage cleared away the boys breathed more freely. But\r\nthe peril was still extreme, for it was no easy matter to keep the\r\ncraft from taking the mighty waves broadside. But the force of the\r\nwind drove them on, and Captain Jerry handled the wheel as only a\r\nveteran tar could.\r\n\r\n\"I guess it's a hurricane,\" was Tom's comment.\r\n\r\n\"Looks more like a cyclone to me,\" spluttered Sam. \"I'd give a good\r\ndeal to be out of it.\"\r\n\r\nTo keep from, being swamped they had to run out to sea. This was no\r\npleasant prospect to the boys, but it could not be helped.\r\n\r\n\"We needn't tell the girls,\" said Dick. \"It will only worry them\r\nmore, without doing any good.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours went by, and the storm kept on as madly as ever. Night was\r\nnow coming on, and soon it was impossible to see a hundred feet in\r\nany direction. The yacht's lanterns were lit, and one was hoisted on\r\na stick which Dick nailed to the stump of the mast.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to, have some sort o' light,\" said Captain Jerry. \"If not,\r\nwe may run afoul o' some other craft.\"\r\n\r\nThe time went by slowly, each hour seeming an age. Nobody felt like\r\neating, and nothing was said about supper until nearly nine o'clock,\r\nwhen Dora opened the cabin door and called Dick:\r\n\r\n\"We thought we would get to shore before eating,\" she said. \"How much\r\nlonger will we be out, do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no telling, Dora,\" he replied evasively.\r\n\r\n\"No telling? Doesn't Captain Jerry know where we are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly. You see it is so dark, and we can't make any headway with\r\nthe mast gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"How stupid of me! I should have known that. Shall we try to fix up\r\nsome supper?\"\r\n\r\n\"You might pass some sandwiches. But, no, we had better come down,\r\none at a time,\" returned Dick.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was carried out, Captain Jerry being the last to go\r\ndown, leaving the wheel in the hands of Dick and Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Don't ye let it git away from ye,\" was his caution. \"If ye do it\r\nwill be good-by, 'Liza Jane, an' all of us goin' slam bang to Davy\r\nJones' locker!\"\r\n\r\nFrom old Jerry the girls learned that they would probably have to\r\nremain on the yacht all night.\r\n\r\n\"Don't ye git alarmed,\" he said. \"The storm's goin' down, an' we'll\r\ncome out all right when the sun rises.\"\r\n\r\nThe prospect of remaining on the ocean all night was dismaying, and\r\nall of the girls wondered what Mrs. Stanhope would say when they did\r\nnot return.\r\n\r\n\"I know mother will be very much worried,\" said Dora soberly.\r\n\r\nIt was decided by the boys that they should take turns at lying down,\r\neach being given two hours in which to rest. Sam was the first to\r\nturn in, but it is doubtful if he slept to any extent. Tom followed,\r\nand then came Dick. Captain Jerry declined, stating he could sleep\r\nwhen he had the party safe on shore once more.\r\n\r\nBy morning the storm had taken another turn. It no longer rained,\r\nbut the sky was murky, and there was a dense fog, which the wind blew\r\nfirst in one direction, and then another. They were still running\r\nto sea, with small prospect of being able to turn back.\r\n\r\n\"This is certainly more than I bargained for,\" observed Dick to Tom,\r\nin a low voice. \"To me it looks mighty serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the storm is bound to go down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Tom, but how long do you suppose the provisions and water will\r\nlast?\"\r\n\r\nAt this question Tom's face fell.\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't thought of that, Dick. I don't suppose we have more than\r\nenough for to-day, have we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we might make it last two days on a pinch--we brought quite\r\na lot along. But after that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think we'll have to stay out here more than two days?\" demanded\r\nSam.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to think, Sam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we rig up some sort of a jury-mast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Jerry mentioned that. We'll try.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no stick on board of the  _Old Glory_ outside of the\r\nbowsprit, and at last they decided to saw this off and put it up as\r\na small mast.\r\n\r\nThe task was no easy one, and just as the temporary mast was being\r\nfitted into place there came an extra heavy puff of wind which sent\r\nthe yacht far over on her side.\r\n\r\n\"Hold fast, all of ye!\" roared Captain Jerry, and they obeyed, and\r\nthe stick went rolling over the side and out of sight in the billows.\r\n\r\n\"Gone!\" gasped Tom. \"That ends putting up another mast.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly the day wore along. The girls were silent, and if the truth\r\nbe told more than one tear was shed between them, although before\r\nthe boys they tried to put on a brave face. There were no regular\r\nmeals, and by the advice of Captain Jerry and Dick they were sparing\r\nof the provisions and the water.\r\n\r\n\"Our only hope now is for the storm to go down, or else to sight some\r\npassing ship,\" said Dick. \"Getting back to Santa Barbara at present\r\nis out of the question. For all we know, we may be a hundred or two\r\nhundred miles from the coast.\"\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock in the afternoon the sky cleared a little. But as\r\nthe fog lifted, the wind blew with greater force, sending them reeling\r\nand plunging into the mighty waves.\r\n\r\n\"It looks as if we should be swamped after all,\" said Tom dolefully.\r\n\r\n\"Never say die, Tom,\" came from Sam resolutely.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose Mrs. Stanhope will be worried half to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of it.\"\r\n\r\nNobody had any heart to talk, and each watched eagerly for some sign\r\nof a sail. Tom had a spyglass, and just before sunset he let out a shout:\r\n\r\n\"A ship! A ship!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" came from the others.\r\n\r\n\"Off in that direction,\" and Tom pointed with his hand.\r\n\r\nAll took a look through the glass, and saw that he was right. There\r\nwas a steamer approaching.\r\n\r\n\"If only they see us.\" said Dick, and his brothers nodded.\r\n\r\nThe girls had heard the cry, and now came on deck to learn what it meant.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I hope they take us on board and back home,\" said Nellie. \"I\r\nmust say I am heartily tired of this yacht.\"\r\n\r\nThe wind was increasing, and the girls had to go back to the cabin\r\nto keep from getting wet. The boys put up a flag, upside down, on a\r\npiece of planking, and waited eagerly for the steamer to come nearer.\r\n\r\n\"The yacht is settling,\" cried Dick, a little while later. \"Don't\r\nyou notice it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Old Glory has sprung some leaks,\" responded Captain Jerry sadly.\r\n\"Take the wheel while I go and look them over.\"\r\n\r\nTom and Sam, took the wheel, while old Jerry and Dick inspected the\r\nleaks. They soon reported that two seams had opened at the bow, and\r\nthat there was a bad break at the stern, which was bound soon to\r\ninterfere with the rudder.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that steamer is going to leave us!\" cried Sam, a little\r\nwhile later.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't say that,\" said Dick. \"We must signal her somehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll fire some rockets,\" said Captain Jerry.\r\n\r\nThis was done, and a little later they saw that the steamer was\r\nheading in their direction. By this time the Old Glory showed\r\nunmistakable signs of being on the point of foundering, and the girls\r\nwere told to come on deck. Everybody was given a life preserver,\r\nwhich had been kept close at hand since the beginning of the trouble.\r\n\r\n\"We are seen!\" cried Sam joyously, as a signal came from the steamer.\r\n\r\nGradually the strange vessel drew closer, and they saw that she was\r\na rather clumsy affair of the \"tramp\" pattern, used to carry all\r\nsorts of cargoes from one port to another.\r\n\r\n\"They are lowering a small boat,\" said Sam, a little later.\r\n\r\n\"I wish they would hurry,\" returned Tom, in a low voice. \"I believe\r\nthis yacht is going to go down very soon.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the small boat was close enough to be hailed, and preparations\r\nwere made for transferring the girls first.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy matter to make the change, and it took a good quarter\r\nof an hour to land the girls on the steamer's deck.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Old Glory was completely water-logged.\r\n\r\n\"We have got to jump for it, lads!\" cried Captain Jerry, \"unless you\r\nwant to go down with her!\"\r\n\r\nAnd jump they did, into the mighty waves, and none too soon, for a\r\nminute later the yacht went down, out of their sight forever.\r\n\r\nThe small boat was not far away, and soon Sam and Tom were picked\r\nup. To get Dick and Captain Jerry was not so easy, but the task was\r\nfinally accomplished, and soon all of our friends stood on the deck\r\nof the tramp steamer, safe and sound once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nDISMAYING NEWS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thank fortune we got away from the yacht just in time!\" exclaimed\r\nTom, as he shook the water from his clothes.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to see the Old Glory go,\" said Captain Jerry sadly. \"I\r\nthought a heap o' that craft, I did. It will be sorry news to take\r\nback to Master Bob.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, we'll help pay for the loss,\" put in Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you folks from?\" questioned the captain of the steamer,\r\nas he came up to, the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"We came from Santa Barbara. The storm took our mast, and blew us\r\nout to sea,\" answered Dick. \"We owe you something for, picking us up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're welcome for what I've done,\" answered Captain, Fairleigh.\r\n\"Come with me, and I'll try to get you some dry clothing. I can trick\r\nout the men folks, and the young ladies will have to see my wife,\r\nwho happens to be with me on this trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"What steamer is this?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"The Tacoma, lad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you bound for San Francisco?\" questioned Sam.\r\n\r\n\"No, we are bound for Honolulu, on the Hawaiian Islands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honolulu!\" burst out the others.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that the first port you will make will be Honolulu?\"\r\ndemanded Dick.\r\n\r\n\"That's my orders, lad. I must get there just as quick as I can, too,\r\nfor a cargo of sugar.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we don't want to go to the Hawaiian Islands!\" put in Dora.\r\n\"Mercy! It's two thousand miles away!\"\r\n\r\nAt this Captain Fairleigh shrugged his broad shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry for you, but I can't put back, miss. Perhaps we'll meet\r\nsome vessel bound for some port in the United States. If so, I can\r\nask the captain to take you back.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if you don't meet any vessel?\" came from Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I think we'll pass some vessel,\" returned the captain.\r\n\r\nHe took the girls and introduced them to, his wife, and then turned\r\nthe boys and old Jerry over to the first mate, who obtained for them\r\nsome dry clothing. After this all were provided with a hot supper,\r\nwhich did much toward making them comfortable, at least physically\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nBut not one of them was comfortable mentally. To be carried to the\r\nHawaiian Islands, two thousand miles away, was no pleasant thought.\r\nBesides, what would their folks think of their prolonged absence?\r\n\r\n\"Mother will think that we have all been drowned,\" said Dora.\r\n\r\n\"And that is what our folks will think, too,\" said Nellie. \"Oh, it\r\nis terrible, simply terrible!\" And she wrung her little hands.\r\n\r\nBy making inquiries Dick learned that the steamer was expected to\r\nreach Honolulu inside of two weeks, if the weather was not too, bad.\r\nFrom Honolulu they could get passage to San Francisco on the mail\r\nsteamer, the trip lasting exactly seven days.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to get some money first,\" said Tom. \"And we can't cable\r\nfor it, either,\" he went on, for the cable to the Hawaiian Islands\r\nfrom the United States had not yet been laid.\r\n\r\n\"Let us hope that we will see some ship that will take us back,\" said\r\nSam.\r\n\r\nDay after day they watched eagerly for a passing sail. But though\r\nthey sighted four vessels and hailed them, not one was bound for the\r\nUnited States, outside of a whaler, and that craft intended to stay\r\nout at least three months longer before making for port.\r\n\r\n\"We are booked for this trip, and no mistake,\" sighed Tom. \"Well,\r\nsince that is so, let us make the best of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tacoma was heavily laden, and though the storm cleared away and\r\nthe Pacific Ocean became moderately calm, she made but slow progress.\r\n\r\n\"Our boilers are not in the best of condition,\" said Captain Fairleigh.\r\n\r\n\"I trust there is no danger of their blowing up,\" returned Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Not if we don't force them too much.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that the boys and girls should pay a fair price\r\nfor the trip to Honolulu, the money to, be sent to the captain of\r\nthe Tacoma later on. As for old Jerry, he signed articles to work\r\nhis passage to the Hawaiian Islands and back again. As Captain\r\nFairleigh was rather short of hands he was glad to have the old sailor\r\njoin his crew.\r\n\r\nThe days slipped by, and, having recovered from the effects of the\r\nstorm, the Rover boys became as light hearted as ever. Tom was\r\nparticularly full of pranks.\r\n\r\n\"No use of crying over spilt milk,\" he declared. \"Let us be thankful\r\nthe pitcher wasn't broken, or, in other words, that we are not at\r\nthis moment at the bottom of the Pacific.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are,\" replied Sam.\r\n\r\nThere was an old piano on board, and the boys and girls often amused\r\nthemselves at this, singing and playing. As there were no other\r\npassengers, they had the freedom of the ship.\r\n\r\n\"This would be real jolly,\" said Tom, \"if it wasn't that the folks\r\nat home must be worried,\" and then he began to sing, for he really\r\ncould not be sad:\r\n\r\n\"A life on the ocean wave,\r\n  A home on the rolling deep,\r\nA house in a watery cave--\r\n  Where I might rest in sleep!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear such a song?\" cried Nellie, and Tom went on:\r\n\r\n\"The boy stood on the burning deck,\r\n  Munching apples by the peck;\r\nThe captain yelled, he stood stock-still,\r\n  For of those apples he wanted his fill!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom Rover!\" burst out Dora. \"I believe you would sing at your own\r\nfuneral!\" And Tom continued gayly:\r\n\r\n\"Sailing, sailing, over the bounding main,\r\n  For many a stormy wind shall blow,\r\nEre the Rovers get home again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom lives on songs,\" said Sam slyly. \"He'd rather sing than eat a pie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pie!\" thundered Tom tragically. \"Who said pie? I haven't seen a\r\nhome-made pie since--since--\"\r\n\r\n\"The time you went down in the pantry at midnight and ate two,\"\r\nfinished Dick, and then there was a burst of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Tom, I'll make you half a dozen pies--when we get home,\"\r\ncame from Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"Will you really?\" said Tom, and then he began once more, as gayly\r\nas ever:\r\n\r\n\"You can give me pudding\r\nAnd give me cake,\r\nAnd anything else\r\nYou care to bake;\r\nBut if you wish\r\nTo charm my eye,\r\nJust hand me over\r\nSome home-made pie!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said Dick. \"But in place of eye you should have\r\nsaid stomach.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stomach doesn't rhyme with pie,\" snorted 'Tom. \"I'm a true poet and\r\nI know what I am doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talking about pie makes me think of pie-plates,\" said Sam. \"Let us\r\nplay spinning the plate on deck. It will be lots of fun trying to\r\ncatch the plate while it is spinning and the steamer is rolling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried Grace, and ran to get a plate from the cook's galley.\r\nSoon they were playing merrily, and the game served to make an hour\r\npass pleasantly. When the forfeits had to be redeemed, the girls made\r\nthe boys do several ridiculous things. Tom had to hop from one end\r\nof the deck to the other on one foot, Sam had to stand on his head,\r\nand recite \"Mary had a Little Lamb,\" and Dick had to go to three of\r\nthe sailors and ask each if they would tie the ship to a post during\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n\"I'll wager you are a merry crowd on land,\" .said Captain Fairleigh,\r\nas he paused to watch the fun. \"Takes me back to the time when I was\r\na boy,\" and he laughed heartily. Even the captain's wife was amused.\r\nShe was particularly fond of music, and loved to listen to the playing\r\nand singing.\r\n\r\nThe days slipped by one after the other, until Captain Fairleigh\r\nannounced that forty-eight hours more ought to bring them in sight\r\nof Diamond Head, a high hill at the entrance to Honolulu harbor.\r\n\r\nBut another storm was at hand, and that night the wind blew more\r\nfiercely than ever. The Tacoma tossed and pitched to such a degree\r\nthat standing on the deck was next to impossible, and all of the boys\r\nand the girls gathered in the cabin and held fast to the posts and\r\nthe stationary seats.\r\n\r\n\"It feels as if the steamer would roll clear over,\" said Sam. \"Here\r\nwe go again!\"\r\n\r\nThere was thunder and lightning, and soon a deluge of rain, fully as\r\nheavy as that experienced while on board of the ill-fated Old Glory.\r\nThis continued all of the night, and in the morning the storm seemed\r\nto grow worse instead of better.\r\n\r\n\"We are in a run of bad luck,\" said Dick. \"I really believe we will\r\nhave all sorts of trouble before we get back to the United States.\"\r\n\r\nToward noon a mist came up, and it grew dark. Lanterns were lit, and\r\nthe Tacoma felt her way along carefully, for Captain Fairleigh knew\r\nthat they were now in the track of considerable shipping.\r\n\r\nBy nightfall the steamer lay almost at a stand-still, for the mist\r\nwas thicker than ever. For safety the whistle was sounded at short\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nThe girls were the first to retire, and the boys followed half an\r\nhour later. The staterooms of all were close together.\r\n\r\nDick Rover was the last to go to sleep. How long he slept he did not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nHe awoke with a start. A shock had thrown him to the floor of the\r\nstateroom, and down came Sam on top of him. There were hoarse cries\r\nfrom the deck, a shrill steam whistle, and the sound of a fog horn,\r\nand then a grinding thud and a bump that told the Tacoma had either\r\nrun into some other ship or into the rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFROM ONE SHIP TO ANOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We struck something!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we going down?\"\r\n\r\nThese and a score of other cries rang out on board the steamer. The\r\nthumping and bumping continued, followed by a crashing that could\r\nmean but one thing--that the ship was being splintered, and that her\r\nseams were being laid wide open.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible the Rover boys slipped into some clothing and\r\nwent on deck. They were quickly followed by the three girls, who\r\nclung tight to them in terror.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dick, this is the worst yet!\" came from Dora. \"What will be the\r\nend?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Tacoma is sinking!\" was the cry from out of the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Are we really sinking?\" gasped Nellie as she clutched Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are,\" came from Sam. \"Can't you feel the deck settling?\"\r\n\r\nThey could, only too plainly, and in a minute more the water seemed\r\nto be running all around them. The cries continued, but it was so\r\nblack they could see next to nothing.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in the next few minutes the Rover boys could scarcely\r\ntell, afterward. An effort was made to get out a life-boat, and it\r\ndisappeared almost as soon as it left the side, carrying some sailors\r\nwith it. Then some red-fire blazed up, lighting up the tragic scene,\r\nand revealing a schooner standing close by the steamer. The sailing\r\nvessel had her bowsprit broken and part of her forward rail torn away.\r\n\r\n\"If we must die, let us die together!\" said Dick, and they kept together\r\nas well as they could. Old Jerry was with them, and said he would do\r\nall he could for them. He had already passed around life-preservers,\r\nand these they put on with all possible speed.\r\n\r\nThen followed a sudden plunge of the steamer and all found themselves\r\nin the waves of the ocean. They went down together, each holding the\r\nhand of somebody else. When they came up, Tom was close to a life-line\r\nthrown from the sailing vessel and this he clutched madly.\r\n\r\n\"Haul us in!\" he yelled. \"Haul us in!\" And the line was pulled in\r\nwith care, and after ten minutes of extreme peril the boys and the\r\ngirls and Captain Jerry found themselves on board of the sailing\r\nvessel, which proved to be a large three-masted schooner.\r\n\r\nAll of our friends were so exhausted that they had to be carried to\r\nthe cabin and here Dora and Grace fainted away completely, while\r\nNellie was little better off. Tom had had his left arm bruised and\r\nDick was suffering from an ugly scratch on the forehead. It was fully\r\nan hour before any of them felt like moving around.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the two vessels had separated, and though red fire\r\nwas burned twice, after that, and rockets sent up, nothing more was\r\nseen or heard of the Tacoma or those left on board.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't think she went down,\" said Captain Jerry. \"She was too\r\nwell built for that.\" And he was right, as events proved. Much crippled\r\nthe steamer two days later entered Honolulu harbor, where she was\r\nlaid up for repairs.\r\n\r\nWorn out completely by what they had passed through, the boys slept\r\nheavily for the rest of the night, not caring what ship they were on\r\nor where they were going. Everybody was busy with the wreckage, so\r\nthey were left almost entirely to themselves.\r\n\r\nTom was the first to get up, and going on deck found that the storm\r\nhad cleared away and that the sun was shining brightly. Without delay\r\nhe halted a sailor who happened to be passing.\r\n\r\n\"What ship is this?\" he questioned.\r\n\r\n\"Dis ship da _Golden Wave_,\" replied the sailor, who was a Norwegian.\r\n\r\n\"And where are you bound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Da ship sail for Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott! Australia!\" gasped Tom. \"This is the worst yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's up, Tom?\" asked Sam, who had followed his brother.\r\n\r\n\"This sailor tells me this ship is bound for Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that is thousands of miles away!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we go to Australia, we'll never get back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite as bad as that, Sam. But we certainly don't want to go to\r\nAustralia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Blossom,\" replied the sailor. \"Where is he?\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor said he would take them to the captain and did so. He\r\nproved to be a burly fellow with rather a sober-looking face.\r\n\r\n\"Got around at last, eh?\" he said, eying Tom and Sam shrewdly.\r\n\r\n\"We have, and we must thank you for rescuing us,\" replied Tom.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of your sailors tells me you are bound for Australia,\" put in Sam.\r\n\r\n\"He told you the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't you stop at some port in the Hawaiian Islands?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you might put us off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't spare the time. As it is, this storm blew me away out of my\r\ncourse,\" answered Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\nHe had a twofold reason for not putting them ashore at or near\r\nHonolulu. It would not only take time, but it might also lead to\r\nquestioning concerning the fate of the steamer, and he was afraid he\r\nwould be hauled into some marine court for running into the Tacoma,\r\nfor that was what he had done.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything about the steamer?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"No, she got away from us in the darkness, after we hauled seven of\r\nyou aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"The steamer lost some of her crew,\" said Tom, shuddering. \"Did you\r\nlose any men?\"\r\n\r\n\"One sailor, and one of my passengers got hurt in the leg by the\r\ncollision.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Dick joined the party, followed by old Jerry and the\r\nthree girls.\r\n\r\n\"Will the captain carry us away to Australia?\" asked Dora, when the\r\nsituation was explained.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so,\" said Dick soberly. \"If I had some money I might buy\r\nhim off, but I haven't a dollar. What little I did have I left on\r\nboard of the Tacoma.\"\r\n\r\nThe others were equally destitute, and when Captain Blossom heard of\r\nthis his face grew dark. He was a close man, and his first mate, Jack\r\nLesher, was no better.\r\n\r\n\"If you haven't any money, you'll have to work your passage,\" he\r\ngrowled. \"I can't afford to carry you to Australia for nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us off at some port in the Hawaiian Islands,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Can't do it, I told you,\" retorted Captain Blossom angrily. \"And\r\nyou'll either work while you are on board or starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"My, what a Tarter!\" whispered Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll work,\" said Dick. \"But you must not force the young\r\nladies to do anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a sailor and will do my full share,\" said old Jerry. But he did\r\nnot like the situation any better than did the Rovers.\r\n\r\nThe matter was talked over, and seeing that they were willing to\r\nwork, Captain Blossom became a little milder in his manner. He said\r\nhe would give the three girls one of the staterooms, but the boys\r\nand old Jerry would have to join the crew in the forecastle.\r\n\r\nFortunately the sailors on board the _Golden Wave_ were a fairly clean\r\nlot, so the forecastle was not so dirty a place as it might otherwise\r\nhave been. The boys did not like to be separated from the girls,\r\nhowever, and Dick called the girls aside to talk the matter over.\r\n\r\n\"I want to know if anything goes wrong,\" said he. \"If there is the\r\nleast thing out of the way, let us know at once,\" and the girls\r\npromised to keep their eyes open.\r\n\r\nOnce in the forecastle the boys were given three rough suits of\r\nclothes to wear while working. Then they were called out to work\r\nwithout delay, for the storm had left much to do on board the Golden\r\nWave.\r\n\r\n\"We have only one passenger,\" said one of the sailors, in reply to\r\na question from Tom.. \"He is a young fellow named Robert Brown. He\r\nwas hurt during the storm, but I reckon he's all right now.\"\r\n\r\nTom was set to coiling some rope and Sam and Dick had to scrub down\r\nthe deck. This was by no means an agreeable task, but nobody complained.\r\n\r\n\"We must take what comes,\" said Dick cheerfully. \"So long as we get\r\nenough to eat and are not abused I shan't say a word.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys had been to work about an hour when Sam saw a young fellow\r\nlimping around the other end of the deck. There was something\r\nstrangely familiar about the party, and the youngest Rover drew closer\r\nto get a better look at him.\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter!\" he cried in astonishment. \"Dan Baxter!\"\r\n\r\nAt this cry the person turned and his lower jaw dropped in equal\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Who--er--where did you come from?\" he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"So this is the vessel you shipped on?\" went on Sam. And then he\r\ncalled out: \"Dick! Tom! Come here.\"\r\n\r\nFor a brief instant Dan Baxter's face was a study. Then a crafty look\r\ncame into his eyes and he drew himself up.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, but you have made a mistake in your man,\" he said coldly.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" came from Sam in bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"I am not the party you just named. My name is Robert Brown.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is?\" came from the youngest Rover. \"If that is so, you look\r\nexactly like somebody I know well.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Dick and Tom came hurrying to the spot, followed by\r\nDora, who happened to be on deck.\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter!\" came from Tom and Dick simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\"He says he isn't Dan Baxter,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't Dan Baxter? Why, Baxter, you fraud, what new wrinkle is this?\"\r\nsaid Dick, catching him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Let go of me!\" came fiercely from Baxter. \"Let go, I say, or it will\r\nbe the worse for you. You have made a mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"No mistake about it,\" put in Tom. \"He is Dan Baxter beyond a doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nIN WHICH THE ENEMY IS CORNERED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loud talking had attracted the attention of Captain Blossom, and\r\nnow the master of the _Golden Wave_ strode up to the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"What's going on here?\" he demanded of the Rover boys. \"Why are you\r\nnot at work, as I ordered?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have made an important discovery,\" answered Dick. \"Is this your\r\npassenger, Captain Blossom?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is. What of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a thief and ran away from San Francisco to escape the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a falsehood!\" roared Dan Baxter. \"They have made a mistake. I\r\nam a respectable man just out of college, and my father, Doctor L.\r\nZ. Brown, is a well-known physician of Los Angeles. I am traveling\r\nto Australia for my health.\"\r\n\r\n\"His real name is Daniel Baxter and his father is now in prison,\"\r\nsaid Tom. \"He robbed us of our money and some diamonds while we were\r\nstopping at a hotel in San Francisco. The detectives followed him\r\nup, but he slipped them by taking passage on your ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you my name is Brown--Robert Brown!\" stormed Baxter. \"This\r\nis some plot hatched up against me. Who are these fellows, anyway?\"\r\nhe went on, turning to the captain.\r\n\r\n\"They came from the steamer we ran into,\" answered Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\n\"I never saw them before.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Dora touched the captain on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Please, captain,\" she said, \"I knew Dan Baxter quite well and I am\r\nsure this young man is the same person.\"\r\n\r\n\"It aint so. I tell you, captain, it is a plot.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of a plot could it be?\" asked Captain Blossom. He scarcely\r\nknew what to say.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Perhaps they want to get hold of my money,\" went on\r\nBaxter, struck by a sudden idea.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, we do want to get hold of the money!\" cried Sam. \"For\r\nit belongs to us--at least two hundred and seventy-five dollars of\r\nit--not counting what he may have got on the diamonds and the cuff\r\nbuttons.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shan't touch my money!\" screamed Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"Captain, he ought to be placed under arrest,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\nDora had gone back to the cabin and now she returned in great haste\r\nwith Nellie and Grace.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, that is Dan Baxter,\" said Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no mistake,\" put in Grace, \"We all know him only too well.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Captain Blossom, that we are six to one,\" said Tom. \"And\r\nyou will surely believe the ladies.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is you all happen to know him so well?\" demanded the captain\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\"We know him because we all went to school together,\" answered Dick.\r\n\"These young ladies lived in the vicinity of the school. We had\r\ntrouble with Baxter at school and later on out West, and ever since\r\nthat time he has been trying to injure us. We met him in San Francisco\r\nin the hotel lobby and at night he went to our room, cut open a\r\ntraveling bag and unlocked our trunks and robbed us of two hundred\r\nand seventy-five dollars in cash, some diamond studs, a pair of cuff\r\nbuttons, and some clothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got an idea!\" almost shouted Sam. \"Maybe he has some of the\r\nstolen stuff in his stateroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, let us search the stateroom: by all means!\" exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\n\"You shall not touch my room!\" howled Baxter, turning pale. \"I have\r\nnothing there but my own private property.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is so, you shouldn't object to having the stateroom searched,\"\r\nobserved Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\n\"If we get back our money we may be able to pay you something, captain,\r\nfor our passage,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\nThis was a forceful argument and set Captain Blossom to thinking. He\r\nwas a man who loved money dearly.\r\n\r\n\"I will go along and we will look around the stateroom,\" he said,\r\nafter a pause.\r\n\r\n\"This is an outrage!\" cried Dan Baxter. \"I will have the law on you\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up! I am master on my own ship,\" retorted Captain Blossom, and\r\nled the way to the stateroom Dan Baxter occupied. The door was locked\r\nand Baxter refused to give up the key. But the captain had a duplicate,\r\nand soon he and the Rover boys were inside the room. Baxter followed\r\nthem, still expostulating, but in vain.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a pocketbook full of bills!\" cried Tom, bringing the article\r\nto light.\r\n\r\n\"Here is my light overcoat!\" came from Dick. \"See, it has my initials\r\nembroidered in the hanger. Aunt Martha did that for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are my gold cuff buttons!\" exclaimed Sam. \"They were a present\r\nfrom my father and they have my monogram engraved on each.\" And he\r\nshowed the articles to the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon it's a pretty clear case against you,\" said Captain Blossom,\r\nturning to Dan Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"Here are half a dozen letters,\" said Tom, holding them up. \"You can\r\nsee they are all addressed to Daniel Baxter. That's his name, and\r\nhe'd be a fool to deny it any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I won't deny it,\" cried the big bully. \"What would be the\r\nuse--you are all against me--even the captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not against you,\" retorted Captain Blossom. \"But if you are a\r\nthief I want to know it. Why did you give me your name as Robert Brown?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my business.\" Baxter paused for a moment. \"Now you have found\r\nme out, what are you going to do about it?\" he went on brazenly. \"You\r\ncan't arrest me on shipboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but we can have you arrested when we land,\" said Dick. \"And in\r\nthe meantime we will take charge of what is our own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are some pawn tickets for the diamonds,\" said Sam, who was\r\ncontinuing the search. \"They show he got seventy-five dollars on them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will keep the tickets--and the seventy-five dollars, too--if we\r\ncan find the money,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\nBut the money could not be found, for the greater part had been turned\r\nover to Captain Blossom for Baxter's passage to Australia and the\r\nrest spent before leaving shore. The pocketbook contained only two\r\nhundred and thirty dollars.\r\n\r\n\"What did he pay you for the passage?\" questioned Dick of the captain.\r\n\r\n\"One hundred dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you ought to turn that amount over to our credit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that Dan Baxter has no right to a free passage on your ship,\r\nsince he bought that passage with our money. Let him work his way\r\nand place that passage money to our credit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way to talk,\" put in Tom. \"Make him work by all means.\"\r\n\r\n\"He deserves good, hard labor,\" came from Sam.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you can make me work!\" burst out Dan Baxter. \"I am a\r\npassenger and I demand that I be treated as such.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are an impostor!\" returned Captain Blossom bluntly. \"The fact\r\nthat you used an assumed name proves it. If I wanted to do so, I\r\ncould clap you in the ship's brig until we reach port and chain you\r\ninto the bargain. I want no thieves on board my ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is more of our clothing,\" came from Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Pick out all the things that are yours,\" said the captain. \"And take\r\nthe other things that are yours, too.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done, nobody paying any attention to Baxter's protests. When\r\nthe Rovers had what there was of their things the captain turned to\r\nthe bully.\r\n\r\n\"I've made up my mind about you,\" he said, speaking with great\r\ndeliberation. \"I am master here, and a judge and jury into the bargain.\r\nYou can take your choice: Either sign articles as a foremast hand\r\nfor the balance of the trip, or be locked up as a prisoner, on prison\r\nrations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean th--that?\" gasped Baxter, turning pale.\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the passage money Goes to the credit of these young fellows.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's an outrage!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's simply justice, to my way of thinking. I'll give you until\r\nto-morrow to make up your mind what you will do.\"\r\n\r\nThis ended the talk with Dan Baxter. The captain said he wanted to\r\nsee the Rover boys in the cabin, and they followed him to that place.\r\n\r\n\"Captain, I feel I must thank you for your fair way of managing this\r\naffair,\" said Dick, feeling that a few good words at this point would\r\nnot go amiss. \"I hope you treat Baxter as he deserves.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try to do right,\" was Captain Blossom's answer. \"But what I\r\nwant to know now is, What do you intend to do with that money? It\r\nseems to me I should be paid something for keeping you on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a proposition to make, captain. We will give you two hundred\r\ndollars if you will allow us to consider ourselves passengers. And\r\nby 'us' I mean the young ladies as well as ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we pay you that amount it will leave us but thirty dollars, hardly\r\nenough with which to cable home for more. Of course, when we get our\r\nmoney in Australia we will pay you whatever balance is due you,--and\r\nsomething besides for saving us.\"\r\n\r\nThis pleased Captain Blossom and he said he would accept the offer.\r\nThe matter was discussed for half an hour, and it was decided that\r\nthe boys should have two staterooms, the one occupied by Baxter and\r\nanother next to that given over to the girls.\r\n\r\nWhen Dora, Nellie, and Grace heard of the new arrangement that had\r\nbeen made they were highly pleased.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want to see you do the work of a common sailor,\" said Dora\r\nto Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it wouldn't kill me,\" he returned lightly. \"Even as it is, I'll\r\ngive a hand if it is necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a wonder Captain Blossom took to your offer so quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"He loves money, that's why, Dora. He would rather have that two\r\nhundred dollars than our services,\" and with this remark Dick hit\r\nthe nail squarely on the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nA BLOW IN THE DARKNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to describe Dan Baxter's feelings after Captain\r\nBlossom and the Rover boys left him alone in his stateroom. At one\r\ninstant he was fairly shaking with rage, and at the next quaking with\r\nfear over what the future might hold in store for him.\r\n\r\n\"They have got the best of me again!\" he muttered, clenching his\r\nfists. \"And after I felt sure I had escaped them. It must have been\r\nFate that made Captain Blossom pick them up. Now I've either got to\r\nwork as a common sailor or submit to being locked up in some dark,\r\nfoul-smelling hole on the ship. And when we get to Australia, unless\r\nI watch my chance to skip out, they'll turn me over to the police.\"\r\n\r\nHe could not sleep that night for thinking over the situation and\r\nwas up and dressed before daylight. Strolling on deck, he came face\r\nto face with Sam, who had come up to get the morning air.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you think you have got the best of me,\" growled Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"It looks like it, doesn't it?\" returned Sam briefly.\r\n\r\n\"The game isn't ended yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but it will be when you land in prison, Baxter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get square.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have promised to get square times without number--and you have\r\nfailed every time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't fail the next time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you will. Wrong never yet triumphed over right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't preach, Sam Rover.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not preaching, I am simply trying to show you how foolish it\r\nis to do wrong. Why don't you turn over a new leaf?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, such talk makes me sick!\" growled the bully, and turned away.\r\n\r\nA little while later Captain Blossom appeared and hunted up Dan\r\nBaxter, who sat in his state-room, packing up his few belongings.\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you decided on your course, young man?\" demanded the\r\nmaster of the _Golden Wave_.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to lock me up if I refuse to become a sailor?\" asked\r\nDan Baxter,\r\n\r\n\"I do, and I won't argue with you, either. Is it yes or no?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to be locked up in some dark hole on your ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are willing to become a sailor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--er--I suppose so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, you can remove your things to the forecastle. Jack Lesher,\r\nthe first mate, will give you your bunk.\"\r\n\r\nThis was \"adding insult to injury,\" as it is termed, so far as Baxter\r\nwas concerned, for it will be remembered that it was Jack Lesher who\r\nhad obtained the passage on the _Golden Wave_ for the bully.\r\n\r\nBut Dan Baxter was given no chance to demur. Taking his traps he went\r\non deck, where Jack Lesher met him, grinning in sickly fashion.\r\n\r\n\"So you are going to make a change, eh?\" said the mate.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't laugh at me, if I am,\" growled Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"I shan't laugh, my boy. It's hard luck,\" said Lesher. \"Come along.\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way to the forecastle and gave Baxter a bunk next to that\r\noccupied by old Jerry. Then he brought out an old suit of sailor's\r\nclothing and tossed it over.\r\n\r\n\"You've run in hard luck, boy,\" he said in a low voice, after he had\r\nmade certain that nobody else was within hearing. \"I am sorry for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" queried Dan Baxter, giving the mate a sharp look.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am, and if I can do anything to make it easy for you, count\r\non me,\" went on Jack Lesher.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose taking that money and the other things was more of boy's\r\nsport than anything, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the truth. I wanted to get square with those Rover boys. They\r\nare my bitter enemies. I didn't want the money.\"\r\n\r\nJust then old Jerry came in and the conversation came to an end. But\r\nBaxter felt that he had a friend on board and this eased him a little.\r\nHe did not know that the reason Jack Lesher liked him was because\r\nthe first mate was a criminal himself and had once served a term in\r\na Michigan jail for knocking down a passenger on a boat and robbing\r\nhim of his pocketbook. As the old saying goes, \"Birds of a feather\r\nflock together.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the girls came on deck they found Baxter doing some of the work\r\nwhich Dick and Tom had been doing the morning before. At first they\r\nwere inclined to laugh, but Dora stopped herself and her cousins.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let us laugh at him,\" she whispered. \"It is hard enough for\r\nthe poor fellow as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to notice him after this,\" said Nellie. \"To me he\r\nshall be an entire stranger.\" And the others agreed to treat Dan\r\nBaxter in the same manner.\r\n\r\nBut the boys were not so considerate, and Tom laughed outright when\r\nhe caught sight of Baxter swabbing up some dirt on the rear deck.\r\nThis made the bully's passion arise on the instant and he caught up\r\nhis bucket as if to throw it at Tom's head.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you dare, Baxter!\" cried Tom. \"If you do we'll have a red-hot\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can lick you, Tom Rover!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you can and perhaps you can't.\"\r\n\r\nBaxter put up his fists, but on the approach of Dick and Sam he\r\npromptly retreated. But before he went he hissed in Tom's ear:\r\n\r\n\"You wait, and see what I do!\"\r\n\r\n\"He had better keep his distance,\" said Dick. \"If he doesn't, somebody\r\nwill get hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it galls him to work,\" said Sam. \"He always was rather lazy.\"\r\n\r\nThe day proved a nice one, and the Rover boys spent most of the time\r\nwith the three girls, who were glad of their company once more.\r\n\r\nAll speculated on the question of what had become of the Tacoma, and\r\nof what the folks at home would think concerning their prolonged absence.\r\n\r\n\"I'd give a good deal to send a message home,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"We must cable as soon as we reach shore,\" added Dora.\r\n\r\nThey saw but little of Dan Baxter during the day and nothing whatever\r\nof him the day following.\r\n\r\n\"He is trying to avoid us,\" said Sam. \"Well, I am just as well\r\nsatisfied.\"\r\n\r\nThrough old Jerry they learned that Baxter hated the work given to\r\nhim and that he was being favored a little by the first mate.\r\n\r\n\"Tell ye what, I hate that mate,\" said Jerry. \"He's got a wicked eye,\r\nand he drinks like a fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he drinks,\" answered Tom. \"I smelt the liquor in his breath.\"\r\n\r\nThey were now getting down into warmer latitudes and the next night\r\nproved unusually hot. It was dark with no stars shining, and the air\r\nwas close, as if another storm was at hand.\r\n\r\n\"I can't sleep,\" said Tom, after rolling around in his berth for half\r\nan hour. \"I'm going on deck.\" And he dressed himself and went up for\r\nsome air. He walked forward and leaned over the rail, watching the\r\nwaves as they slipped behind the noble ship.\r\n\r\nTom's coming on deck had been noticed by Dan Baxter, who sat on the\r\nside of the fore-castle, meditating on his troubles. As the bully\r\nsaw the youth leaning over the rail, his face took on a look of bitter\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\n\"I'll teach him to laugh at me!\" he muttered.\r\n\r\nGazing around he saw that nobody was within sight and then he arose\r\nto his feet. With a cat-like tread he came up behind Tom, who still\r\nlooked at the waves, totally unconscious of danger.\r\n\r\nBaxter's heart beat so loudly that he was afraid Tom would hear it.\r\nAgain he looked around. Not a soul was near, and the gloom of the\r\nnight was growing thicker.\r\n\r\n\"He'll laugh another way soon!\" he muttered, and stepped closer.\r\n\r\nHis fist was raised to deliver a blow when Tom happened to straighten\r\nup and look around. He saw the form behind him and the upraised arm\r\nand leaped aside.\r\n\r\nThe blow missed its mark and Tom caught Baxter by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Dan Baxter, by this attack?\" he began, when the\r\nbully aimed another blow at him. This struck Tom full in the temple\r\nand partly dazed him. Then the two clenched awl fell heavily against\r\nthe rail.\r\n\r\n\"I'll fix you!\" panted Baxter, striking another blow as best he\r\ncould, and then, as Tom struck him in return, he forced Tom's head\r\nagainst the rail with a thump. The blow made Tom see stars and he\r\nwas more dazed than ever.\r\n\r\n\"Le--let up!\" he gasped, but Baxter continued to crowd him against\r\nthe rail, which at this point was very weak because of the collision\r\nwith the steamer. Suddenly there was a snap and a crack and the rail\r\ngave way. Baxter leaped back in time to save himself from falling,\r\nbut Tom could not help himself, and, with a wild cry, he went overboard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA CALL FROM THE STERN\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the instant after Tom slipped over the side of the _Golden Wave_,\r\nDan Baxter was too dazed to do more than stare at the spot where he\r\nhad last seen the boy with whom he had been struggling.\r\n\r\n\"Gone!\" he muttered presently. \"Gone!\" he repeated and crouched back\r\nin the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe great beads of perspiration came to his brow as he heard rapid\r\nfootsteps approaching. Would he be accused of sending Tom Rover to\r\nhis death?\r\n\r\n\"What's the trouble?\" came in the voice of Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\nInstead of answering, Dan Baxter crept still further back. Then,\r\nwatching his chance, he darted into the forecastle.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, the rail is broken!\" he heard the captain exclaim. \"Bring a\r\nlantern here, quick!\"\r\n\r\nA sailor came running with a lantern, which lit up the narrow circle\r\nof the deck near the rail and part of the sea beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody gave a cry,\" said the captain, to those who began to gather.\r\n\"Looks to me as if the rail gave way and let somebody overboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom Rover was on deck,\" came from old Jerry. \"Do you reckon as how\r\nit was him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. It was somebody, that's certain. Call all hands at once.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done, and Dan Baxter had to come out with the rest. He was\r\npale and trembled so he could scarcely stand.\r\n\r\n\"All here,\" said Captain Blossom. \"Must have been one of the Rover\r\nboys or one of the young ladies.\"\r\n\r\nWord was passed along and soon Sam and Dick came rushing on deck.\r\n\r\n\"Tom is missing!\" cried Sam.\r\n\r\n\"If that is so, I'm afraid, boys, you have seen the last of your\r\nbrother,\" said Captain Blossom. He turned to his crew. \"Do any of\r\nyou know anything of this affair?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence. Then he questioned the man at the wheel.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know a thing, cap'n,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"It's queer. He must have pressed on the rail very hard.. Here are\r\nhalf a dozen nails torn from the wood.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this talk was going on Dick and Sam had passed along the rail\r\nfrom the place of the accident to the stern.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he caught hold somewhere,\" said Sam, who was unwilling to\r\nbelieve that his brother had really perished.\r\n\r\nThey had just gained the stern and were looking over when a call came\r\nfrom out of the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"He--help! Help!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Tom!\" screamed Dick in delight. \"Tom, is that you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! Help!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Holding on to a rope. Help me quick. I--I can't hold on mu--much\r\nlonger!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll help you,\" answered Dick.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blossom was called and more lanterns were lit, and then a\r\nBengal light, and Tom was seen to be holding fast to a rope which\r\nhad in some manner fallen overboard and become entangled in the\r\nrudder chain.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the boat-hook the rope was hauled up and to the side\r\nof the _Golden Wave_. At the same time the sails were lowered, and then\r\na rope ladder was thrown down. Dick descended to the edge of the\r\nwaves, and, watching his chance, caught Tom by the collar of his\r\ncoat. Then the brothers came slowly to the deck.\r\n\r\nA cheer went up when it was found that Tom was safe once more, and\r\nNellie Laning could not resist rushing forward and catching the wet\r\nyouth in her arms. Tom was so exhausted he dropped on the nearest\r\nseat, and it was several minutes before he had recovered strength\r\nenough to speak.\r\n\r\n\"I would have been drowned had it not been for that rope,\" he said\r\nwhen questioned. \"As I slid along the side of the ship the rope hit\r\nme in the face. I clutched it and clung fast for dear life. Then when\r\nI came up and swept astern I called as loudly as I could, but it\r\nseemed an age before anybody heard me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a narrow escape,\" said Dick. \"You can thank a kind Providence\r\nthat your life was spared.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have leaned on the rail awfully hard,\" put in Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"Leaned on the rail?\" repeated Tom. \"It wasn't my fault that I went\r\noverboard. It was Dan Baxter's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter!\" came from several.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. He tackled me in the dark, and we had it hot and heavy for\r\na minute. Then he crowded me on the rail, and it gave way. He jumped\r\nback and let me go overboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rascal! I'll settle with him!\" cried Dick. \"I'll teach him to\r\nkeep his distance after this!\"\r\n\r\nHe knew Baxter was still forward, and ran in that direction. The\r\nbully saw him coming and tried to hide in the forecastle, but Dick\r\nwas too quick for him and hauled him back on the deck.\r\n\r\n\"Take that for shoving my brother overboard, you scoundrel!\" he\r\nexclaimed, and hit Baxter a staggering blow straight between the eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" roared the bully, and struck out in return. But Dick dodged\r\nthe blow, and then hit Baxter in the chin and on the nose. The elder\r\nRover boy was excited, and hit with all of his force, and the bully\r\nmeasured his length on the deck.\r\n\r\n\"Good fer you!\" cried old Jerry, who stood looking on. \"That's the\r\nway to serve him, the sarpint!\"\r\n\r\nSlowly Baxter arose to his knees, and then his feet, where he stood\r\nglaring at Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you hit me again!\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"But I will,\" retorted Dick, and struck out once more. This time his\r\nfist landed on the bully's left eye, and once again Baxter went down,\r\nthis time with a thud.\r\n\r\nThe sailors were collecting, and soon Jack Lesher rushed up. He stepped\r\nbetween Dick and the bully.\r\n\r\n\"Stop it!\" he ordered harshly. \"We don't allow fighting on board of\r\nthis craft.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't fighting,\" answered Dick coolly. \"I was just teaching a\r\nrascal a lesson.\"\r\n\r\n\"It amounts to the same thing. If you have any fault to find tell\r\nthe captain, or tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll go to the captain, not you,\" retorted Dick.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" growled the first mate. \"But just remember you can't\r\nboss things when I'm around.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Blossom understood the situation he was thoroughly angry.\r\n\r\n\"Baxter certainly ought to be in prison,\" he said. \"I'll clap him in\r\nthe brig and feed him on bread and water for three days and see how\r\nhe likes that.\"\r\n\r\n\"He ought not to be left at large,\" said Dora, with a shudder. \"He\r\nmay try to murder somebody next.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll watch him after this,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\nHe kept his word about putting Baxter in the ship's jail. But through\r\nLesher the bully, got much better fare than bread and water. Strange\r\nas it may seem, a warm friendship sprang up between the bully and\r\nthe first mate.\r\n\r\n\"I aint got nothing against you, Baxter,\" said Jack Lesher. \"When we\r\nget to Australia perhaps we can work together, eh?\" and he closed\r\none eye suggestively. Baxter had told him of his rich relative, and\r\nthe mate thought there might be a chance to get money from Baxter.\r\n\"He'd rather give me money than have me tell his relation what sort\r\nof a duck he is,\" said Lesher to himself.\r\n\r\nAfter this incident the time passed pleasantly enough for over a\r\nweek. When Baxter came from the brig he went to work without a word.\r\nWhenever he passed the Rovers or the girls he acted as if he did not\r\nknow they were there, and they ignored him just as thoroughly. But\r\nthe boys watched every move the bully made.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, Jack Lesher was a drinking man, and as the\r\nweather grew warmer the mate increased his potions until there was\r\nscarcely a day when he was thoroughly sober. Captain Blossom remonstrated\r\nwith him, but this did little good.\r\n\r\n\"I'm attending to my duties,\" said Lesher. \"And if I do that you\r\ncan't expect more from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I hired a man that was sober,\" said Captain Blossom. \"I\r\nwon't place my vessel in charge of a man who gets drunk.\"\r\n\r\nYet he was not willing to do the mate's work, or put that work onto\r\nothers, so Jack Lesher had to take his turn on deck, no matter in\r\nwhat condition.\r\n\r\n\"I must say I don't like that first mate at all,\" said Tom to Sam.\r\n\"He is very friendly with Baxter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have noticed that,\" replied the youngest Rover. \"Such a friendship\r\ndoesn't count in the mate's favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Last night he was thoroughly drunk, and wasn't fit to command.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is Captain Blossom's lookout. The captain can't be on\r\ndeck all of the time.\"\r\n\r\nTwo nights after this talk Jack Lesher was again in command of the\r\nship, Captain Blossom having retired after an unusually hard day.\r\n\r\nIt was hot and dark, and the air betokened a storm. The man at the\r\nwheel was following a course set by the captain, and the sailors\r\nwhose watch was on deck lay around taking it as easy as they could.\r\n\r\nThe mate had been drinking but little in the afternoon, but before\r\ncoming on deck he took several draughts of rum. He was in a partiallarly\r\nbad humor and ready to find fault with anybody or anything.\r\n\r\nSome of the sails had been reefed, and these he ordered shaken out,\r\nalthough there was a stiff breeze blowing. Then he approached the\r\nman at the wheel and asked for the course.\r\n\r\n\"Southwest by south,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"That aint right,\" growled the mate. \"It should be south by west.\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain gave it to me southwest by south,\" answered the man.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk back to me!\" roared Jack Lesher. \"I know the course as\r\nwell as the captain. Make it south by west, or I'll flog you for\r\ndisobeying orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" answered the man at the wheel, and the course was\r\nchanged, for the sailor stood greatly in fear of the mate. Then the\r\nmate sent below for another drink of rum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nANOTHER ACCIDENT AT SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was four hours later, and Captain Blossom was just preparing to\r\ncome on deck, when there, came a fearful shock which threw the Golden\r\nWave back and over on her side.\r\n\r\n\"We have struck! We are on the rocks!\" came a shrill cry from the\r\ndeck, and immediately there was an uproar.\r\n\r\nThe Rover boys were thrown to the floor from their berths, and it\r\nwas several seconds before they could realize what had happened.\r\n\r\n\"We have struck something, that is sure!\" gasped Sam.\r\n\r\nAs quickly as they could they donned their clothing and made their\r\nway to the large state-room occupied by the girls.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a shock!\" came from Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"Are you safe?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I am, but poor Grace struck her head on the wall, and is unconscious.\"\r\n\r\nWithout ceremony Tom picked up the unconscious girl, wrapped her in\r\na blanket, and, aided by Sam, carried her to the deck, the others\r\nfollowing. A minute later Grace revived.\r\n\r\nOn deck they found all in confusion. The bowsprit of the _Golden Wave_\r\nwas gone, and also the main topmast, while a mass of the rigging\r\nlittered the forecastle. It was also announced that the rudder was\r\nbroken and the vessel was pounding helplessly on the rocks, with a\r\nbig hole in the bow directly below the waterline.\r\n\r\n\"Who changed the course?\" demanded Captain Blossom. \"We should be\r\nfifty miles away from these rocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first mate made me change the course,\" said the man who had been\r\nat the wheel. \"I told him you had said southwest by south, and he\r\nmade it south by west.\"\r\n\r\n\"He don't know what he's talking about!\" howled Jack Lesher. The\r\nshock had partly sobered him. \"He was steering due south, and I told\r\nhim to make it southwest by south.\"\r\n\r\nBut little more could be said on the point, for it was feared that\r\nthe schooner would go down at any moment.\r\n\r\n\"We must man the boats,\" said the captain. \"Bring up the provisions\r\nand the kegs of water, and be quick about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we near land?\" asked Dick.\r\n\r\n\"There should be some islands four or five miles south of this spot,\"\r\nanswered Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\nNow that there was danger of going down some of the sailors seemed\r\nto grow crazy. Half a dozen tumbled into one of the boats and began\r\nto lower it of their own accord.\r\n\r\n\"Stand back there!\" shouted the captain. \"The girls must go first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much!\" shouted one of the sailors. \"It's everybody for himself\r\nnow!\" And in a moment more the small boat had left the ship's side\r\nand disappeared in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThere were three other boats and the remaining sailors, along with\r\nthe first mate and Dan Baxter, wanted to crowd into these. But Captain\r\nBlossom said he would shoot the first man who tried to row away\r\nwithout his orders. Then some provisions were put into the boats,\r\nand the captain divided the whole company among the three boats.\r\n\r\n\"Let us stay together, captain,\" pleaded Dick. \"We can row.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what of the girls, Rover?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go with the Rover boys,\" pleaded Dora, and Nellie and Grace\r\nsaid the same. Old Jerry also stood by his friends.\r\n\r\nWhile this talk was going on there was a rush for two of the boats,\r\nand before Captain Blossom could do anything his men were off, taking\r\nJack Lesher and Dan Baxter with them.\r\n\r\n\"You can go down with the ship!\" cried Dan Baxter mockingly. An\r\ninstant later the darkness hid the speaker from view.\r\n\r\n\"They have left us,\" cried Captain Blossom. \"But, thank fortune, the\r\nbest and largest boat is also left.\"\r\n\r\nSome provisions had been tumbled into this boat, and a cask of water\r\nfollowed. Then the girls were placed on board, the Rover boys followed,\r\nand the captain and old Jerry came behind, to cut away. Down went\r\nthe small boat into the mighty waves, and each of the boys caught up\r\nan oar.\r\n\r\n\"Pull!\" roared Captain Blossom. \"Pull for your lives!\" And they did\r\npull, two boys on one side, and Sam and old Jerry on the other. The\r\ngirls huddled in the stern, expecting every moment to see the little\r\ncraft turn bottom side up. They scraped along the side of the doomed\r\nship, and then along some rocks. Captain Blossom was in the bow,\r\npeering ahead.\r\n\r\n\"To the left!\" he yelled. \"Quick!\" And then came a shock, and the\r\ncaptain disappeared beneath the waves.\r\n\r\n\"The captain is gone!\" screamed Dora, but she was hardly heard, for\r\nthe ship was pounding on the rocks, and the spray was flying in all\r\ndirections. The boys and old Jerry continued to pull, knowing not\r\nwhat else to do, and at last the spot was left behind and they found\r\nthemselves on the bosom of the mighty Pacific, in the black darkness,\r\nout of sight of everything, with only the sounds of the wind and the\r\nwaves filling their ears.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think we will ever get out of this alive?\" asked Grace of Dora.\r\n\r\n\"Let us pray that we may all be spared,\" answered Dora, and they did\r\npray, more earnestly than they had ever before prayed in their whole\r\nlives. It was a moment that put their faith to a supreme test.\r\n\r\nThe boys did not dare to stop rowing, and they kept on until their\r\nbacks ached and their arms seemed ready to drop from their sockets.\r\n\r\n\"We had better take turns,\" said Dick, at last. \"We can't keep this\r\nup all night..\" And his suggestion was followed out, two, rowing at\r\na time, for a space of fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nThey thought they might see something of the other boats, but nothing\r\ncame to view, and when they set up a shout at the top of their lungs,\r\nno answer came back.\r\n\r\n\"They have either gone down or else got out of this neighborhood,\"\r\nsaid Tom.\r\n\r\n\"It was too bad to lose Captain Blossom,\" said Sam. \"He was not such\r\na bad sort, after all.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this that a mass of wreckage drifted past\r\nthem. There was a bit of broken spar and some other woodwork, but no\r\nhuman being, and they let the wreckage go.\r\n\r\nBy looking at his watch Dick saw that it was three o'clock in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\"It will be light in another couple of hours,\" he said. \"If we can\r\nkeep on top of the waves until then perhaps we can sight the islands\r\nthe captain mentioned.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish it was daylight now,\" sighed Nellie.\r\n\r\nFortunately a bundle of clothing had been brought along, and as the\r\nwater was warm, nobody suffered much from the wetting received. Care\r\nwas taken to keep the provisions as dry as possible, for there was\r\nno telling how long it would be before they would be able to get more.\r\n\r\nSlowly the night dragged by, and, with the coming of morning, the\r\nwind went down, the storm passing to the northward.\r\n\r\n\"It is growing lighter,\" announced Dora. \"The sunlight is beginning\r\nto, show over the rim of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the sun came up, like a great ball of fire from\r\na bath in the ocean, capping the high waves with gold. As the light\r\nspread around them, Dick stood up on a seat and gazed eagerly in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n\"What do you see?\" demanded the others.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" he answered, with a sinking heart; \"nothing but water on\r\nall sides of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The islands--they must be somewhere!\" cried Tom, and he, too, took\r\na look, followed by the others. The last to look was old Jerry.\r\n\r\n\"Can't see much,\" said the old sailor slowly. \"But I kind of reckon\r\nthere's a dark spot directly southward.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be one of the islands the captain mentioned!\" exclaimed Dora.\r\n\r\n\"We might as well row in that direction,\" said Dick. \"There is nothing\r\nelse to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's queer what became of the other boats,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\nSome of the provisions were brought forth and they ate sparingly,\r\nand drank a little of the water. Then the boys and old Jerry took up\r\nthe oars once more and began to pull as nearly southward as they\r\ncould make it, steering by the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun grew higher it became very warm, so that the rowers were\r\nglad enough to lay aside their jackets. By noon they reckoned that\r\nthey had covered six or eight miles. One after another stood up on\r\nthe seats to take a look around.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing in sight yet,\" said Dick, with a sorry shake of his head.\r\n\"We must have been mistaken in that dark spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do now?\" asked Grace. \"The hot sun is beginning to\r\nmake my head ache.\"\r\n\r\nSam's head also ached, but he said nothing. Nobody knew what to suggest.\r\n\r\n\"One thing is certain; we can't remain out on the bosom of the ocean,\"\r\nsaid Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Better continue to pull southward,\" came from old Jerry. \"There are\r\nlots of islands down that way. The map is full of 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the map is full of them,\" answered Dick. \"But a quarter of an\r\ninch on the map means a hundred miles or two in reality.\"\r\n\r\nYet it was decided to row on, trusting to luck to strike some island,\r\neither large or small. It was now fiercely hot, and all hands perspired\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the afternoon the boys were worn out, and had to give\r\nup rowing. The girls were dozing in the stern, having covered their\r\nheads with a thin shawl, stretched from one gunwale to another. Tom\r\nand Sam were dizzy from the glare of the sun on the water.\r\n\r\n\"Another day like this will set me crazy,\" said the youngest Rover.\r\n\"I'd give ten dollars for a pair of blue goggles.\"\r\n\r\nOld Jerry had been looking intently to the westward. Now he pointed\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\n\"See that trail of smoke,\" he said. \"Unless I am mistaken a steamship\r\nis sailing toward us!\"\r\n\r\n\"A steamship!\" cried Tom, and the words awoke the girls. \"We must\r\nhail the vessel by all means.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she comes close enough,\" said Captain Jerry pointedly. \"Don't be\r\ntoo hopeful, my lads. She may pass us by.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE CRUSOES OF SEVEN ISLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll on board of the rowboat watched the thin trail of smoke with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it is going away from us,\" said Dora.\r\n\r\n\"No, it is coming closer,\" said Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly moving to the northward,\" put in Sam.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour went by and the smoke came only a little nearer.\r\n\r\n\"She is a big steamer,\" said Captain Jerry. \"But she aint comin' jest\r\nthis way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are sure?\" cried Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, lad. It's too bad, but it can't be helped.\"\r\n\r\nThe old sailor was right; half an hour later the smoke had shifted,\r\nand after that it faded gradually from sight.\r\n\r\nIt was a heavy blow, after their expectations had been raised so\r\nhigh, and tears stood in the eyes of all of the girls, while the boys\r\nlooked unusually sober.\r\n\r\nWhat was to do next? All asked that question, yet it was only Captain\r\nJerry who answered it.\r\n\r\n\"Let us pull southward,\" said he.\r\n\r\nAnd they did so, although with hearts that were as heavy as lead in\r\ntheir bosoms.\r\n\r\nSlowly the night came on. Shortly after the sun set the moon showed\r\nitself and the sky became studded with stars, the Southern Cross\r\nstanding out boldly among them. The pale light made the bosom of the\r\nocean glisten like silver.\r\n\r\n\"A beautiful night,\" said Dora. \"But who can enjoy it when we do not\r\nknow what to-morrow will bring forth,\" and she sighed deeply.\r\n\r\nThe boys and old Jerry continued to take turns at rowing, while the\r\ngirls sank into fitful slumber.\r\n\r\nPresently the old sailor raised his head.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" he said, and they did so, and far away heard a strange booming.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" questioned Sam.\r\n\r\n\"It's breakers!\" cried Tom. \"We must be near some coast!\"\r\n\r\n\"The lad is right,\" came from Captain Jerry. \"We are near an island,\r\nafter all!\"\r\n\r\nDick stood on a seat, and, as the boat rode to the top of a wave,\r\ntook a look around.\r\n\r\n\"An island!\" he cried. \"Dead ahead!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! We are saved!\" ejaculated Sam. \"What is the matter?\" questioned\r\nDora, rousing up, followed by the other girls.\r\n\r\n\"There is an island ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must be careful how we approach the shore, lads,\" cautioned Jerry.\r\n\"If we strike the rocks, it may cost us our lives. Perhaps we had\r\nbetter hold off until daylight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see a stretch of sand!\" came from Tom, who was standing up. \"If\r\nwe can reach that, we'll be all right.\"\r\n\r\nOld Jerry took a careful look. The sand was there, true enough, but\r\nthere were dangerous breakers between the boat and that shore.\r\n\r\n\"If you say so, we can run our chances,\" he said. \"The young ladies\r\nmust hold tight, and not mind a good ducking.\"\r\n\r\nThe force of the waves was now carrying them closer and closer to\r\nthe breakers. Under old Jerry's directions the boys took a short,\r\nsharp stroke, keeping the rowboat straight up to the waves. The noise\r\nwas like thunder, and soon the spray was flying all over them.\r\n\r\n\"Now pull!\" cried Captain Jerry. \"One, two, three! Hold tight, girls!\"\r\nAnd away they went into the breakers. One wave dashed over the craft,\r\nbut it was not swamped, and before another could hit them they darted\r\nup a swell and onto a long, sandy beach.\r\n\r\nIn a twinkle the old sailor was out, along with Dick, and, aided by\r\nanother wave, they ran the boat well up the beach, out of the harm\r\nof the waves. It was a hard struggle, and when it was over Dick sank\r\ndown almost exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"Saved!\" murmured Dora, as she leaped out on shore. \"Thank Heaven!\"\r\nAnd all of the others echoed the sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe empty boat was pulled up out of harm's way and chained fast to\r\na palm tree growing near, and then the party of seven sat down to\r\nrest and to talk over the new condition of affairs. They were on a\r\nwild, tropical coast, with a long, sandy beach running to the ocean,\r\nand back of this a dense mass of tropical vegetation, including palms,\r\nplantains, cocoanuts, and date trees. Back of the heavy growth was\r\na distant hill, standing out dimly in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n\"This looks like a regular Crusoe-like island,\" said Dora, as she\r\ngazed around. \"There is not a sign of a habitation anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good many of the South Sea islands are not inhabited,\" said Dick.\r\n\"The natives won't live on them because they are subject to volcano\r\neruptions, earthquakes, and tidal waves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope we don't have any of those things while we stay here,\" came\r\nfrom Nellie. \"An earthquake would scare me almost to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see that we can do better than to stay right here for the\r\nrest of the night,\" said Tom. \"I am too tired out to walk very, far.\"\r\n\r\nIt was decided to follow Tom's advice, and all made themselves as\r\ncomfortable as circumstances permitted. They had some matches in a\r\nwaterproof safe, and soon a camp-fire was started, at which they\r\ndried some of their garments. Then, after eating some of the provisions\r\nthat were left, they laid down to rest. Strange as it may seem all\r\nslept soundly until sunrise, and nothing came to disturb them.\r\n\r\nWhen the girls arose they found the boys and Captain Jerry already\r\npreparing breakfast. On the shore Tom, had found some oysters and\r\nshell-fish, and these were baking. Among the provisions were a little\r\ntea and coffee, and old Jerry had made a pot of coffee, which did\r\none good to smell. Sam had brought down some cocoanuts from a nearby\r\ntree, and also found some ripe bananas.\r\n\r\n\"We won't starve' to death here, that's certain,\" said Dick, when\r\nthey all sat down to eat. \"The island is full of good things. If I\r\nhad a gun I could bring down lots of birds, and monkeys, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I'd care to eat a monkey,\" said Grace. \"But I wouldn't\r\nmind eating birds.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must be plenty of fish here, too,\" said Tom. \"In fact I saw\r\nsome sporting in the waters of a little bay up the coast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go up and down the coast after breakfast?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"My advice is to climb yonder hill and take a squint around,\" came\r\nfrom Captain Jerry.\r\n\r\n\"That's a splendid idea, providing we can get to the tap,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"There is no use of all of us going, lad. You can go with me while\r\nthe rest stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do in the meantime?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Better try your hand at fishin', lad, and see if you can knock some\r\nbirds over with sticks and stones. If ye get anything, let the girls\r\ncook us somethin', for we'll be powerful hungry by the time we get back.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Captain Jerry and Dick set out. Each carried a\r\nfew ship's biscuits and also a heavy stick which had been cut in the\r\nthickets. Each wished he had a gun or a pistol, but those articles\r\nwere not to be had.\r\n\r\nThe climb up the hill was by no means an easy one. The rocks were\r\nrough and in many spots the jungle of brush and vines was so thick\r\nthat to get through was next to impossible. It was very warm, and\r\nthey had to stop often to cool off and catch their breath.\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder that people in hot countries move slowly,\" said Dick.\r\n\"I feel more like resting than doing anything else.\"\r\n\r\nIt was almost noon when they came in sight of the top of the hill.\r\nThere were still some rough rocks to climb, and these they had to\r\nascend by means of some vines that grew handy.\r\n\r\n\"What a magnificent view!\" cried Dick.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was magnificent. Looking back in the direction they had\r\ncome they could see the Pacific Ocean, glittering in the bright\r\nsun-light and stretching miles and miles out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe island they were on looked to be about half a mile in diameter.\r\nNorthward, eastward, and westward was the ocean, but to the southward\r\nwas a circlet of six islands, having a stretch of calm water between\r\nthem. Between some of the islands the water was very shallow, while\r\nelsewhere it looked deep.\r\n\r\n\"Seven islands in all,\" said old Jerry. \"And not a sign of a house\r\nor hut anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are the Crusoes of Seven Islands,\" said Dick. \"But do you really\r\nbelieve they are uninhabited?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do ye see any signs of life, lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must say I do not. It's queer, too, for I rather imagined one at\r\nleast of the other boats had reached this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought the same. But it looks now as if they all went to Davy\r\nJones's locker, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly does look that way.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the hill they took a careful survey of the situation.\r\nThe elevation was in the very center of the island. Down toward the\r\nother islands the slope was more abrupt than it was in the direction\r\nfrom which they had come.\r\n\r\n\"We can take a look at those other islands later on,\" said old Jerry.\r\n\"Reckon as how we have done enough for one day. If we don't git back\r\nsoon, they'll become anxious about us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had a flag,\" said Dick. \"Here is a tall tree. We could\r\nchop away the top branches and hang up a signal of distress. If we\r\ndid that, perhaps some ship would come this way and rescue us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right ye are, lad, but it aint many ships come this way. They are\r\nafraid o' the rocks we run on.\"\r\n\r\nHaving looked around once more, to \"git the lay o' the land,\" as\r\nCaptain Jerry expressed it, they started to descend the hill. This\r\nproved as difficult as climbing up had been.\r\n\r\nDick went in advance, and was half-way down when he stepped on a\r\nloose stick and went rolling into a perfect network of vines and\r\nbrushwood.\r\n\r\n\"Are ye hurt?\" sang out old Jerry.\r\n\r\n\"No--not much!\" answered the eldest Rover. \"But my wind--Oh, goodness\r\ngracious!\"\r\n\r\nDick broke off short, and small wonder. As 'he arose from the hole\r\ninto which he had tumbled, a hissing sound caught his ears. Then up\r\ncame the head of a snake at least eight feet long, and in a twinkle\r\nthe reptile had wound itself around the boy's lower limbs!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSETTLING DOWN ON THE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong, lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"A snake! It has wound itself around my legs!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye don't say!\" gasped Captain Jerry, and then leaped down to the\r\nhollow. \"Well, by gosh! Take that, ye beast!\"\r\n\r\n\"That\" was a blow aimed at the reptile's head with the sailor's stick.\r\nOld Jerry's aim was both swift and true and the head of the reptile\r\nreceived a blow which knocked out one eye and bruised its fang. But\r\nthe body wound itself around Dick tighter than ever.\r\n\r\nFortunately the youth had not lost his wits completely, and as the\r\nneck of the reptile came up, he grasped it in his hand with the\r\nstrongest grip he could command.\r\n\r\n\"Cut it--cut its head off!\" he panted. \"Get your pocket-knife!\"\r\n\r\nAt once Captain Jerry dropped his stick and pulled out his jack-knife,\r\na big affair, such as many old sailors carry. One pull opened the\r\nmain blade, and then old Jerry started in to do as Dick had suggested.\r\nIt was no easy job and the body of the snake squirmed and whipped in\r\nevery direction, lashing each on the neck and the cheek. But the head\r\ncame off at last and then they left the body where it fell, and leaped\r\nout of the way of further danger.\r\n\r\n\"A close shave, lad,\" said the old sailor, as he peered around for\r\nmore snakes.\r\n\r\n\"I--I should sa--say it wa--was,\" panted Dick. He was deadly pale.\r\n\"I--I thought it would strangle me sure!\"\r\n\r\n\"If it had got around your neck, that is what would have happened.\r\nReckon as how we had better git out o' this neighborhood, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, let us go at once,\" and Dick started off once more.\r\n\r\nAfter that both were very careful where they stepped and kept their\r\neyes wide open for any new danger which might arise. So they went on\r\nuntil they came in sight of the seashore.\r\n\r\n\"We had better say nothing about the snake,\" said the eldest Rover.\r\n\"It will only scare the girls to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, lad, you are wrong. We must warn them of danger. Otherwise they\r\nmay run into it headlong.\"\r\n\r\nAll of the others were glad to have them back and plied them with\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\"So there are seven islands,\" said Tom. \"Well, as there are seven of\r\nus, that is one island apiece. I don't think we need complain,\" and\r\nhis jolly manner made all laugh.\r\n\r\nWhen Jerry told the story about the snake Dora set up a scream.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dick, if it had really strangled you!\" she gasped. \"You must be\r\nvery, very careful in the future!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and you must be careful, too, Dora,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"There is a nice beach right around the edge of the island,\" said\r\nold Jerry. \"So, when we want to visit the other islands, we can walk\r\naround on the sand. That is better than climbing the hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the beach doesn't run to the other islands, does it?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"No, but we can carry our rowboat around with us, to that bay between\r\nthe islands. There the water is smooth enough for anybody to row in.\"\r\n\r\n\"The six islands are shaped exactly like a ring,\" said Dick. \"And\r\nthis island is the big stone on top.\"\r\n\r\n\"As the island is uninhabited I suppose we'll have to settle down\r\nand build ourselves huts or something,\" came from Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure. We'll be regular Robinson Crusoes,\" answered Tom. \"Why,\r\nI can tell you it will be jolly, when we get used to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where will we build our huts?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"We can build them here, if we wish,\" replied Dick. \"But I rather\r\nfavor the side fronting the other islands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's the best side,\" said Captain Jerry. \"If we build here,\r\na strong storm may knock our huts flat. That side is more sheltered\r\nand, consequently, safer. Besides, there is more fruit there, and\r\nI'm sure better fishing in the bay, and that's what counts, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it counts--since we must live on fruits, fish, and what\r\nbirds and animals we manage to knock over,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\nThe boys had been fairly successful in hunting and fishing, having\r\nknocked over half a dozen birds and caught four fair-sized fish.\r\nEverything had been done to a turn over the camp-fire, and Dick and\r\nold Jerry did full justice to what was set before them--on some dried\r\npalm leaves Nellie had found. Their coffee they drank out of some\r\ncocoanut shells. They had no forks, but used sharp sticks instead,\r\nand the knives the boys carried in their pockets.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued fine and that night the moon shone as brightly\r\nas ever. The boys took a stroll on the beach to talk over their plans.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to say there is no telling how long we may have to stay\r\nhere,\" said Dick. \"It may be a day, a week, or for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, some ship is bound to pick us up some day,\" returned Tom. \"And\r\nif we can find enough to live on in the meantime, what is the use of\r\ncomplaining? I am glad my life was spared.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I, Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to know what became of Dan Baxter,\" put in Sam. \"Can\r\nit be possible that all of the rest perished?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly it is possible, Sam. You know what a time we had of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an awful death to die--in the midst of the ocean,\" and the\r\nyoungest Rover shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you,\" said Tom. \"But I am more sorry for Captain Blossom\r\nthan for Baxter.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wrecking of the ship was the fault of the mate. He was drunk,\"\r\nsaid Dick. \"The man at the wheel was doing what was right until Jack\r\nLesher came along.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess the mate went down with the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" cried Sam, pointing to sea. \"I see something dark on the water.\"\r\n\r\nAll gazed in the direction he pointed out and made out a mass of\r\nwreckage. They watched it steadily until the breakers cast it almost\r\nat their feet.\r\n\r\n\"Some wreckage from the ship!\" cried Dick, on examination. \"See, here\r\nis the name on some of the woodwork. I reckon the vessel went to\r\npieces on the rocks.\"\r\n\r\nThe wreckage consisted mainly of broken spars and cordage. But there\r\nwere also some boxes, which, on being opened, proved to contain\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\"It's not such a bad find, after all,\" said Tom. \"I hope some more\r\ncomes ashore.\" But though they waited the best part of the night,\r\nnothing more came to view.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the boys felt tired and they did not rouse up until\r\nnearly noon. They found old Jerry at the beach, inspecting the wreckage.\r\n\r\n\"The ropes may come in handy,\" he said. \"But the wood is of small\r\naccount, since' we have all we want already to hand.\"\r\n\r\nIt was decided to remain at the beach for the next day, to look for\r\nmore wreckage. But none came in, and then they started in a body to\r\nskirt the shore around to the South Bay, as old Jerry called it. At\r\nfirst they thought to carry the boat around, but concluded to come\r\nback for that later.\r\n\r\nIt was a journey full of interest, for the sandy beach was dotted\r\nwith many strange and beautiful seashells, and just back of the sand\r\nwas the rich tropical growth already mentioned. The woods were full\r\nof monkeys and birds, and once Tom thought he caught sight of some\r\ngoats or deer.\r\n\r\nThey reached an ideal spot fronting the little bay a little before\r\nnoon, and then the girls were glad enough to sit down in the shade\r\nand rest. The bay was full of fish, and before long they had caught\r\nthree of the finny tribe. Fruit was also to be had in plenty, and a\r\nspring of fresh water gushed from the rocks of the hill behind them.\r\n\r\n\"This is certainly a beautiful place,\" murmured Dora, as she gazed\r\naround. \"Were it not for the folks at home worrying about us, I could\r\nspend quite some time here and enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as our situation cannot be helped, let us make the best of\r\nit,\" said Dick cheerfully. \"There is no use in being downhearted when\r\nwe ought to be glad that we were saved.\"\r\n\r\nClose to the rocks they found several trees growing in something of\r\ntwo circles, and they decided that these trees should form the corner\r\nposts of a double house or cabin.\r\n\r\n\"If we had an ax we might cut down some wood, but as it is we will\r\nhave to use strong vines and cover the huts with palm leaves,\" said\r\nCaptain Jerry.\r\n\r\nThe boys were soon at work, cutting the vines and gathering the palm\r\nleaves, and the girls assisted as well as they were able in fastening\r\nup the vine-ropes and binding in the leaves. It was slow work, yet\r\nby nightfall one half the house was complete and the other had the\r\nroof covered.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if rain comes, we can keep fairly dry,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\nIt rained the very next day and they were glad enough to crowd into\r\nthe completed part, while the rain came down in torrents. When the\r\nworst of the downpour was over the wind arose and it kept blowing\r\nfiercely all of the afternoon and the night.\r\n\r\n\"We can be thankful we are sheltered by the hill,\" said Sam. \"Were\r\nwe on the other side of the island, the wind would knock the hut flat\r\nand drench us in no time.\"\r\n\r\nThe storm kept all awake until early morning and when it went down\r\nthey were glad to sink to rest. All slept soundly and it was not\r\nuntil ten o'clock, when the sun was struggling through the clouds,\r\nthat Tom arose, to find the others still slumbering.\r\n\r\n\"I'll let them sleep,\" he said to himself \"They need it and there\r\nis no need for them get to up.\"\r\n\r\nStretching himself, he walked quietly from the hut and down to the\r\nbeach. His first thought was to try to collect some wood, more or\r\nless dry, and start a fire.\r\n\r\nGazing across the bay to one of the other islands, he saw a sight\r\nwhich filled him with astonishment. There, on the beach of the island,\r\nlay the wreck of the _Golden Wave_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nANOTHER CASTAWAY BROUGHT TO LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The _Golden Wave_! Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nTom could not resist setting up a shout when he saw the familiar hull\r\nof the schooner, resting quietly on the beach of an island on the\r\nother side of the bay.\r\n\r\nThe cry awoke Sam, Dick, and old Jerry, and they came running out to\r\nlearn what it meant.\r\n\r\n\"The schooner!\" came from Sam. \"How did that get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"The storm must have driven her off the rocks and into this bay,\"\r\nanswered Dick. \"She didn't go down, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a fine thing for us,\" put in Captain Jerry, his broad face\r\nbeaming with pleasure. \"Now we can have all the provisions we want,\r\nand clothing and guns, and if we can anchor the wreck in some way,\r\nwe can live on her just as comfortably as in a house at home.\"\r\n\r\nThe excited talking brought the girls out one after another, and they\r\nwere equally pleased over the stroke of good fortune.\r\n\r\n\"She seems to be cast up pretty high on the sand,\" said old Jerry. \"But\r\neven so, the sooner we get to her the better, or the sea may carry\r\nher off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready to go now,\" said Tom. \"But how are we to get to that\r\nisland? It's a pity we didn't bring our boat around.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are two islands of the circle in between,\" came from Sam. \"Why\r\ncan't we swim from one to the next and get around that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can try it, lad. But we want to be careful. There may be sharks\r\naround in these parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't let the sharks eat you up!\" cried Grace.\r\n\r\n\"We'll keep our eyes open, never fear,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\nA vote was taken, and it was decided that Sam should remain with the\r\ngirls, to protect them in case of unexpected danger, while Tom, Dick,\r\nand old Jerry should make their way as best they could to the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe old sailor and the two boys were soon off. They tramped down the\r\nbeach a short distance and then reached a coral reef leading to the\r\nnext island. Here the water was not over a foot and a half deep, and\r\nas clear as crystal, so the passage to Island No. 2, as Tom named\r\nit, was comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nThe second island crossed they followed the shore around until they\r\ncame opposite to the island upon which the wreck rested. Here there\r\nwas a channel sixty or eighty feet wide and of unknown depth, the\r\nchannel through which the wreck had most likely entered the bay. The\r\nwater here was by no means smooth and Captain Jerry shook his head\r\ndoubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"It won't be no easy swim,\" he said. \"Reckon as how I'll try it first.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can get over easily enough,\" said Dick, and threw off part of his\r\nclothing and his shoes. He was soon in the water and striking out\r\nboldly, and the others followed.\r\n\r\nShort as was the distance, the swim was as hard as any of them looked\r\nfor, and when they reached the other side of the channel all were\r\nout of breath and had to rest for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"It's a good thing no shark happened to be near,\" said Tom. \"The\r\nmonster would certainly have had us at his mercy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the wreck they found the stern well out of the\r\nwater. The _Golden Wave_ lay partly on her left side and it was a\r\ncomparatively easy matter to, gain the deck.\r\n\r\nThe masts were gone and there was a big hole in the bow, but otherwise\r\nthe craft had suffered little damage. Why she had not sunk was a\r\nmystery until, later on, old Jerry discovered that some of the cargo,\r\nconsisting of flat cases, had got wedged into the break, thus cutting\r\noff a large portion of the leak.\r\n\r\n\"We can anchor her without trouble,\" said the old sailor. \"And perhaps\r\nstraighten her up too, so the deck won't be so slanty. Then she'll\r\nbe a reg'lar hotel for all hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go below and see how things are down there,\" said Dick, and\r\nhe at once led the way.\r\n\r\nAt that instant a loud sneeze reached their ears, causing Dick to\r\npause on the companion way. Looking into the cabin he saw a man\r\nstanding there, partly dressed.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Blossom!\" he ejaculated. \"Is it really you or your ghost?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dick Rover!\" cried the master of the schooner. \"Then you weren't\r\ndrowned, after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, captain. But--but how did you escape?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it really Captain Blossom?\" came from Tom, and he rushed down\r\ninto the cabin, followed by old Jerry. All shook hands, and the face\r\nof the captain showed his pleasure over the meeting.\r\n\r\n\"So you all escaped and are here,\" he said. \"I am downright glad to\r\nknow it. What of the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know what became of the other boats,\" answered Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Saw nothing at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain shook his head sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\"But how did you escape?\" asked Dick again.\r\n\r\n\"That is a short story, lad. When I went overboard from the rowboat,\r\nI caught hold of some of the wreckage from the schooner. This was\r\nstill fast to the deck, and by hauling myself in I soon got on board\r\nagain. As I had no boat, I remained on board, for I soon saw that\r\nthe schooner would not go down immediately. At daylight the ship left\r\nthe rocks and drifted around on the ocean until the wind came up last\r\nnight, when we struck this island and got beached, as you see. I was\r\nworn out with watching, and as soon as I found the boat was safe from\r\nsinking I went to bed, and slept soundly until I heard you three\r\ntramping around the deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are stopping over on yonder island,\" said Tom, when all went on\r\ndeck, and he pointed in the direction. \"See, Sam and the girls are\r\nwaving to us. Let us wave in return, and stand apart, so they can\r\nsee that there are four of us.\"\r\n\r\nThey did as the youngest Rover advised and soon saw that they were\r\nseen. Then Captain Blossom held up his spyglass.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon they will know who I am by that,\" he said, and he was right,\r\nfor Sam told the girls that the fourth man was Captain Blossom beyond\r\na doubt.\r\n\r\n\"How is your stock of provisions?\" asked old Jerry. \"We are getting\r\njust a bit tired of living on birds and fish. And we want a gun or\r\na pistol with which to protect ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Golden Wave_ has enough provisions to last this party a year,\"\r\nanswered the captain. \"We haven't anything very fine, but we have\r\nplenty of flour, dried beans, salt and smoked meats, and a good many\r\ncases of canned vegetables, as well as sugar, tea, coffee, salt, and\r\npepper. With fresh fish and some game we'll be able to live as well\r\nhere as if we were on shore,--that is, if we can find fresh water.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have all the fresh water we want,--on the large island,\" said\r\nTom. \"And lots of tropical fruit--cocoanuts, bananas, and the like.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we are going to live on the ship, we'll have to bring fresh water\r\nover from the other island in a cask,\" said Dick. \"That will not be\r\nvery handy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we move the wreck over?\" came from Tom.\r\n\r\n\"No, lad,\" answered Captain Blossom. \"She is here to stay until her\r\ntimbers rot. But if we wish, we can move some of the provisions\r\nashore. There are the parts of a rowboat below, and I reckon I am\r\ncarpenter enough to put the parts together in a day or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have a boat on the north beach,\" said old Jerry; \"we can bring\r\nit around.\"\r\n\r\n\"To do that, we'll have to swim the channel again,\" came from Dick.\r\n\"And I must say I don't like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us make a raft,\" cried Tom. \"There must be plenty of material\r\non board of the schooner for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"There certainly is,\" answered Captain Blossom. \"Come, we can make\r\na raft in less than an hour.\"\r\n\r\nAll set to work, and in a short space of time they had the material\r\ntogether. Ropes and spikes were there a-plenty, and as Captain Blossom\r\nlaid out one stick and another, the boys and old Jerry either nailed\r\nor tied them together. A board flooring was placed on top of the\r\nspars and then the whole affair was dumped into the bay with a loud\r\nsplash. It floated very well, with the flooring a good ten inches\r\nabove the surface of the water, and as the raft was nearly twenty\r\nfeet long by ten wide, it was capable of carrying considerable weight.\r\n\r\n\"That's better than a boat,\" said Dick. \"We can pile a good deal more\r\nstuff on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us get on and paddle to where we left the others,\" said Tom.\r\n\"They will be anxious to learn the news.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Blossom was willing, and they took with them a variety of\r\nprovisions and also some extra clothing and some firearms. Then the\r\nraft was moved to where the boys had left part of their own clothing\r\nwhen they had started to swim the channel.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the big raft and its passengers to the shore where the\r\ncabin was located was greeted with shouts of joy from Sam and the\r\nthree girls.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for the captain of the _Golden Wave_!\" cried Sam, swinging his\r\ncap in the air. \"We are very glad to see you safe and sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am glad to see you,\" answered Captain Blossom, as he leaped\r\nashore and grasped one and another by the hand. \"Last night I was\r\nthinking I would be a lonely castaway; now I find I shall have plenty\r\nof company.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have brought along some provisions,\" put in Tom. \"And in honor\r\nof this reunion, and also in honor of the fact that the Golden 'Wave\r\nhas not been sunk, I move we invite the girls to get us up a regular\r\nfeast. I think all bands deserve it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Second the motion!\" cried Sam.\r\n\r\n\"All right, we'll cook you anything you want,\" said Nellie. \"That\r\nis, if you will supply the things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" answered Tom. Then he scratched his head. \"Well, by gracious!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the trouble, Tom?\" asked Grace. \"Did you forget to bring\r\nalong some sugar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse than that. I brought along all sorts of good things to eat,\r\nand not a single knife, fork, spoon, or dish outside of some cooking\r\nutensils.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" burst out Dora. \"It will be a sorry feast if we haven't\r\nanything to eat from!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go back for the dishes,\" replied Tom promptly. \"Sam, do you\r\nwant to visit the wreck? We can go and come by the time the things\r\nare cooked.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure I'll go,\" said Sam; and in a few minutes more the two\r\nboys were off on the clumsy raft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSAM AND THE SHARK\r\n\r\n\"The _Golden Wave_ looks like an old friend,\" said Sam as they paddled\r\nacross the smooth waters of the bay.\r\n\r\n\"Her coming here is the finest thing that could have happened,\"\r\nanswered his brother. \"I didn't want to say anything before, but if\r\nshe hadn't come what would we have done for clothing and for eating?\r\nWe couldn't live on fish all the time, and one can do mighty little\r\nhunting without a gun.\"\r\n\r\n\"We would have had to set traps, Tom, and dig pitfalls for larger\r\ngame. But I admit it would have been hard work, and I fancy a suit\r\nof goatskins, like Robinson Crusoe wore, wouldn't be half as comfortable\r\nas a suit of clothes such as I am wearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we could only float the schooner and sail away to some nearby port.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no port' within three hundred miles of us, so the captain\r\nsays.\"\r\n\r\nSoon the boys were halfway across the bay. But moving the big raft\r\nwas a laborious task, and they were glad enough to sit down and rest\r\nfor a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\"There is no use of our hurrying,\" said Tom. \"Our time is our own in\r\nthis out-of-the-way place, and as we have next to nothing to do we\r\nwant to make what little work there is last us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a lazy man working by the day,\" laughed Sam. \"I'm afraid I\r\ncan't work that way. When I have something to do I'm not content\r\nuntil it is done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you hot, Sam? Here is something to cool you off.\"\r\n\r\nAs Tom spoke he playfully scooped up a handful of water and threw it\r\nat his brother.\r\n\r\nSoon the two boys were having lots of sport, throwing handfuls of\r\nthe salty water at each other. Then Sam made a motion as if he was\r\ngoing to push Tom overboard with his paddle.\r\n\r\n\"Hi! none of that!\" cried Tom. \"I don't mind a wetting by retail,\r\nbut I don't want it by wholesale.\"\r\n\r\nHe continued to throw water at Sam and the youngest Rover tried to\r\ndodge. The raft began to rock, and of a sudden Sam lost his balance\r\nand went into the bay with a splash.\r\n\r\nTom set up a laugh, for it was a comical sight, and it had been Sam's\r\nown fault that he went overboard. But then Tom's laughter came to an\r\nend as he saw the form of a shark moving swiftly toward the spot.\r\n\r\n\"A shark! a shark!\" he screamed. \"Sam, get on board, quick! A shark\r\nis after you!\"\r\n\r\nSam had gone far down beneath the surface and he did not reappear at\r\nonce. Then he came up spluttering.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh! I didn't want a bath! Tom, you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurry and get aboard, Sam! A shark is after you!\"\r\n\r\nSam was about ten feet from the raft, and running to the spot nearest\r\nto him, Tom held out the end of his paddle.\r\n\r\n\"A shark?\" gasped the youngest Rover.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! yes! Catch the end of the paddle!\"\r\n\r\nSam made a frantic effort to do so. In the meantime the shark came\r\ncloser and Tom could see his enormous mouth and sharp teeth clearly.\r\nHis blood turned to ice in his veins.\r\n\r\nSam made a clutch at the paddle, missed it, and disappeared once more\r\nfrom sight. The shark rushed to the spot and turned in dismay, and\r\ndriven to desperation, Tom hit the monster over the head with the\r\npaddle. Then the shark disappeared also.\r\n\r\nThe next few seconds were full of agony for poor Tom. He gazed in\r\nall directions for Sam, and for the shark, but neither one nor the\r\nother was to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"He must have caught Sam under the water!\" he muttered. \"Oh, Sam,\r\nwhat an awful death to die!\"\r\n\r\nA slight noise at the upper end of the raft disturbed him. He turned\r\nswiftly, to see a wet hand glide over the woodwork. He made a leap\r\nand clutched the hand, and then Sam's head appeared. He gave a frantic\r\nyank, and both lay on the flooring of the raft. Sam was saved.\r\n\r\n\"The shark!\" gasped Tom, when he could speak. \"Did it--it--bite you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but it grazed my shoulder,\" answered Sam. \"If I had not dived\r\ndown, I would have lost an arm at the very least.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they felt able they looked around, but the shark had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"That settles it,\" said Tom. \"We must be careful and keep out of this\r\nwater in the future. If we want to bathe, we will have to build a pool.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the trip to the wreck both were careful not\r\nto run the slightest chance of falling overboard.\r\n\r\n\"Not such a very lovely place to live in, after all,\" said Tom.\r\n\"Snakes on land and sharks in the water, ugh!\" And Sam agreed with him.\r\n\r\nOnce on the wreck it was an easy thing to obtain the dishes and the\r\nknives, forks and spoons, and also some other things they thought\r\nthey might require. They also brought away another gun, loading it\r\nup before leaving the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if Mr. Shark comes around again, we can give him a dose of\r\nbuckshot,\" said' Tom.\r\n\r\nBut the shark did not appear, excepting at a great distance.\r\n\r\nWhen Sam. told his story all congratulated him on his narrow escape.\r\n\r\n\"Tom is right,\" said old Jerry. \"Ye mustn't do no bathin' in the bay.\r\nWe can fix two pools, one for the ladies and one for ourselves, and\r\nmake another pool for fish, and another for turtles, if we can find any.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls had cooked a splendid meal, and soon the table was set on\r\na big flat rock lying near the beach. All sat down and Captain Blossom\r\nasked a blessing, and then they all fell to with vigor, for all were\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\n\"The salt air gives one an appetite,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\nThe meal lasted the best part of an hour, for, as Tom said, there\r\nwas no use of hurrying. As they ate, and for some time afterward,\r\nthey discussed their situation and tried to arrange plans for the future.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that first of all Dick and old Jerry should climb to\r\nthe top of the hill, taking with them an ax and a flag and some\r\nhalyards, and fasten the flag to the top of the tree, stars down, as\r\na signal of distress. Then the whole party was to assist in bringing\r\nfrom the wreck as much building material as was necessary to construct\r\na comfortable dwelling of three large rooms, one for the girls, one\r\nfor the boys and men, and one as a general living room. A store-house\r\nwas also to be built, in which could be stored such provisions as\r\nwere brought away from the wreck from time to time. Then they could\r\nlive on shore or on the ship, as they pleased.\r\n\r\nThe following day was Sunday and all rested. The girls thought there\r\nshould be some sort of religious exercises and all went to the wreck,\r\nwhere Captain Blossom read some chapters from the Bible and the others\r\nsang hymns.\r\n\r\nThe week to follow was a busy one and the time slipped by rapidly.\r\nA visit was paid to the hilltop and the flag raised, and Tom and old\r\nJerry also went to the north shore and brought around the rowboat\r\nbeached there. In the meantime Captain Blossom put together the\r\nrowboat parts stored on the _Golden Wave_, so they now had two boats\r\nand the raft for service across the bay and to other points on the water.\r\n\r\nBuilding the house was by no means an easy task, but the Rover boys\r\nthought it more fun than work, especially with the girls to look on,\r\nand by the end of the second week the building looked quite presentable.\r\nWhen the two bedrooms were finished, some berths were brought over\r\nfrom the wreck, along with bed-clothing, and also some furniture for\r\nthe living apartment. Outside the latter room a large porch was built,\r\nwhere they might eat and rest when the weather was fine. Not to run\r\nthe risk of burning down the building in a high wind, it was decided\r\nthat the cooking should be done in a shed some distance away, in the\r\nshelter of the rocks and handy to the spring.\r\n\r\n\"Who is going to be the cook?\" asked Dick. \"It won't be fair to put\r\nit off on one person.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have decided to take turns,\" said Dora. \"Each one will be the\r\nmain cook for a day at a time, with the others to help, and to wash\r\nthe dishes. We are going to do all the housework, too, so you men\r\nfolks can hunt and fish, and make garden if you will, to your hearts'\r\ncontent.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a lazy time we will have of it,\" laughed Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Blossom says that as soon as we are settled we can explore\r\nall of the seven islands. Who knows we may find out something of\r\nimportance,\" came from Tom, who stood near.\r\n\r\n\"Cannibals, for instance,\" put in Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you really think there are any cannibals here?\" asked Grace.\r\n\r\n\"I believe he is fooling,\" said Nellie. \"He only wants to scare us!\"\r\nAnd she tossed her pretty head.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we'll stir up some lions or tigers,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Or an elephant,\" added Dick. \"But I don't think we will. My opinion\r\nis that these islands have nothing on them but birds, monkeys, small\r\ngame, and snakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've forgotten one thing,\" said Dora, with an odd smile.\r\n\r\n\"What, Dora?\"\r\n\r\n\"Castaways.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nEXPLORING THE SEVEN ISLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother rainy spell, lasting three days, followed, but after that\r\nthe sky cleared in a fashion which Captain Blossom thought betokened\r\ngood weather for some time to come.\r\n\r\n\"We can now explore the seven islands and learn just what they\r\ncontain,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe question now arose as to who should go along and who should stay\r\nat home with the girls. Lots were cast, and by this it was decided\r\nthat the exploring party should consist of Captain Blossom, Sam, and\r\nTom, leaving Dick and old Jerry with Dora, Nellie, and Grace.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the exploring party should take the lightest of\r\nthe rowboats and enough provisions to last for a week. Each was also\r\nprovided with a pistol, and Captain Blossom carried a rifle in addition.\r\n\r\n\"If all goes well we will be back inside of four days,\" said the\r\ncaptain, when he and Tom and Sam were ready to depart. \"But if we\r\nare not back at that time do not worry until at least a week has gone\r\nby.\" And so it was arranged. It was also arranged that three shots\r\nfired in succession should be a signal that one party or the other\r\nwas in trouble.\r\n\r\nTom and Sam were pleased over the prospect of going with the captain\r\nand they willingly took up the oars to row to the nearest island,\r\nwhich, as we already know, was close at hand. The boat was left on\r\nthe beach and without delay the captain and the two boys plunged into\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\nThe island was small, with but a slight rise of ground in the center.\r\nIt was of small importance and they soon came out on the ocean side,\r\nwhere there was a beach strewn with shells and with oysters scarcely\r\nfit to eat. The growth on this island was mostly of young palms and\r\nthe captain was of the opinion that the ground was not many years old.\r\n\r\n\"This has been thrown up by an earthquake or a volcano,\" he said.\r\n\"There is nothing here to interest us,\" and he turned back.\r\n\r\nThey already knew something of the island on which the wreck was\r\nlocated, but, nevertheless, made a trip across it and up the outward\r\ncoast. Here they found a number of orange and lemon trees, and also\r\na great quantity of tropical nuts and some spices. The lemons proved\r\nto be very refreshing, and Tom said he meant to come back some day\r\nand get a bagful for general use.\r\n\r\nThe next island was visited the next day, the party spending the\r\nnight on the wreck. The passage to this island was rather a rough\r\none, and they had all they could do to keep from having their provisions\r\nspilt overboard.\r\n\r\n\"It is a blessing that the sea is comparatively calm,\" said Captain\r\nBlossom. \"Otherwise we could never make such a trip in a small boat.\"\r\n\r\nThis island was the largest of the group outside of the one on which\r\nthe castaways had settled. It was almost square in shape and had a\r\ndouble hill with a tiny valley running between. In this valley the\r\ntropical growth was very dense, and the monkeys and birds were thicker\r\nthan they had before seen them. There were also large quantities of\r\nblue and green parrots, filling the air with their cawing and screaming.\r\n\r\n\"This is a very nice island,\" said Tom, while they were resting under\r\nsome calabash trees. \"The wood is very valuable--indigo, rosewood,\r\nmahogany, and lots of others. And what a sweet smell!\" And he drew\r\nin a long breath of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly a lazy man's paradise,\" re-turned Sam. \"A fellow\r\nneed do next to nothing to feed and clothe himself here, and a house\r\nisn't absolutely necessary excepting when it storms real hard.\"\r\n\r\nOn this island they found numerous land crabs, some as large as their\r\ntwo hands, and many fierce-looking spiders, with long, hairy legs\r\nand bulging eyes. Ants were also numerous, and in one spot they\r\nlocated fifteen anthills, each as large as a big beehive. Insects\r\nof all sorts were numerous, and they had to continually slap at a\r\nspecimen of red fly that annoyed them greatly.\r\n\r\n\"How those ants would like to get at our provisions,\" said Tom. \"We\r\ncan be thankful that we didn't locate here. Once they got at the\r\nstuff, they would eat us out of house and home.\"\r\n\r\nAfter resting, and partaking of some of the food brought along, they\r\ncontinued their journey across the island.\r\n\r\nThe way was up one of the hills, and Tom was slightly in advance,\r\nwhen a noise ahead attracted his attention.\r\n\r\n\"Something is there,\" he called out, as he came to a halt.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Perhaps some wild animal, or else a snake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go slow there,\" cautioned Captain Blossom, coming up. \"We don't want\r\nto run into unnecessary danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did it sound like, Tom?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't describe it. Something like a snarl, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it was only a monkey.\"\r\n\r\nAll stopped to listen, but no, sound reached their ears but the hum\r\nof insects and the chirping of some distant birds.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon I had best go first,\" said Captain Blossom, but he did not\r\nseem to relish the task.\r\n\r\nGun in hand, the captain advanced very cautiously. The boys came\r\nclose behind him, each with his pistol ready for use.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden there was a snarl with a strange \"yow-yawing,\" and a\r\ngreat beast leaped up on all-fours directly in their path and darted\r\nthrough the bushes. The captain raised his gun and the boys their\r\npistols, but before they could fire the beast had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"What was it?\" asked Sam, trembling with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"I give it up, unless it was a bear,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I think I know what it was,\" said the captain. \"A big baboon or a\r\ngorilla.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you are right, captain,\" answered Tom. \"I saw a gorilla in\r\na menagerie, and it was exactly like that beast. But what a big fellow\r\nhe was!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gorillas are highly dangerous, especially when cornered,\" said\r\nCaptain Blossom. He himself was more frightened than he cared to\r\nadmit. \"They have been known to carry a man off in their arms and\r\nbite him to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, but I want no gorillas around me,\" declared Sam.\r\n\r\nThey waited several minutes before advancing again. But the gorilla\r\nhad disappeared, nor did it show itself again during that trip on\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour brought them in sight of the seashore once more. They\r\nwere gazing at the sea when Tom happened to glance back, and on the\r\nhill behind them saw four goats standing in a bunch, looking at them\r\nin astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Quick! out of sight!\" he cried, and dragged the others behind some\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\"What did you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Several goats. Perhaps, if we are careful, we can get a shot at\r\nthem. Fresh goat meat won't go bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with capturing some of the goats and getting the\r\nmilk?\" came from Sam.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have a job catching wild goats,\" answered Captain Blossom.\r\n\"They are as fleet of foot as deer.\"\r\n\r\nIt was decided to try two shots at the goats, providing they could\r\nget close enough. With care they plunged into the undergrowth and\r\nmade their way back up the hillside until they thought they must be\r\nwithin fifty yards of the game.\r\n\r\n\"There they are!\" cried Tom softly.\r\n\r\nBang! went the captain's gun, and crack! Tom fired immediately after.\r\nTwo of the goats were hit, and one fell dead. The other staggered\r\naway with a broken foreleg.\r\n\r\n\"We must get that second fellow!\" cried Sam, and rushed after the\r\ngame. The goat tried to turn on him, but Sam hit the beast over the\r\nhead with a club he carried. Two other blows finished the animal.\r\n\r\n\"That isn't bad,\" said the captain. \"They both look to be young. They\r\nought to make good eating.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are going to have no easy work of it, getting these animals down\r\nto the shore,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"After we get them to the shore, what then?\" questioned his brother.\r\n\"We can't keep them in the boat all the time that we are exploring\r\nthe other islands.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had best make a trip back to the house,\" answered Captain Blossom.\r\n\"If the others heard the shots they'll be wondering what has happened;\r\nbesides, a storm is coming up.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain said he would carry the smaller of the goats alone,\r\nleaving the two Rovers to carry the larger game between them. After\r\na rest and another look around the vicinity, they started for the\r\nboat and reached it after a walk which almost exhausted every one of\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be glad enough to lay around our camp and rest for a day,\"\r\nannounced Sam. \"This task of exploring is not as easy as it looks.\"\r\n\r\nA little later they were in the boat and rowing back to where they\r\nhad left the others, little dreaming of the strange events that had\r\nhappened in their absence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nUNEXPECTED VISITORS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been decided by the castaways to enlarge one of the rooms of\r\nthe house, and as soon as the captain, Tom, and Sam had departed on\r\ntheir exploring tour, Dick and old Jerry set to work to cut down the\r\nposts necessary for the building.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on the three girls were by no means idle. There\r\nwere meals to get, dishes to wash, and it had been found that outdoor\r\nlife was very rough on clothing, so there was a good bit of sewing\r\nand darning to be done. Fortunately all of the girls were handy with\r\na needle, so that a rent in a coat or a dress received immediate\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\"Now you must make the alteration in the house very nice,\" said Dora\r\nto Dick. \"Remember, we want a regular Queen Anne building, with round\r\nbay windows, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And inlaid floors,\" finished Dick, \"not to mention steam heat, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy on us!\" burst in Grace. \"Don't mention steam heat in this\r\nclimate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we want hot and cold water in the kitchen,\" put in Nellie.\r\n\"What sort of a mansion would it be without hot and cold water,--and\r\na dumb waiter from the cellar, too,\" and then all began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I know what I should like,\" said Dora, after a pause. \"That would\r\nbe a refrigerator.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we had the ice,\" finished Nellie. \"Dick, isn't there any ice on\r\nboard of the _Golden Wave_?\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove! I think there is,\" cried the oldest Rover boy. \"I never\r\nonce thought of it before.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there is, I wish you'd bring some the next time you go over. We\r\nhave lemons, and we could make delicious lemonade.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we could make orange ice, too,\" put in Grace. \"I know there was\r\nan ice-cream freezer on board of the ship. It was in the cook's galley.\"\r\n\r\nOld Jerry was coming to the house with a small tree he had cut down,\r\nand Dick sounded him about the ice.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure there was ice, several tons of it,\" said Jerry. \"It was\r\nstowed away near the bow. I don't believe it's all melted, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going over to see,\" cried Dick. \"We've got plenty of lemons and\r\nsugar; and lemonade, not to mention orange ice, would just strike\r\nthe spot in this awfully hot weather.\"\r\n\r\nBut as it was now noon, with the sun directly overhead, Dick decided\r\nto remain in the shade until four or five o'clock. Dinner was had,\r\nand then the work of enlarging the house went on as before.\r\n\r\nAt half-past four Dick got out the rowboat and started for the wreck.\r\nHe had first thought to go alone, but old Jerry wanted to pick out\r\ncertain tools needed for the house-building, as well as hunt for a\r\nkeg of nails, and the two decided to go together, going and coming\r\nas quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\"You won't be afraid to be alone, will you?\" asked Dick, of the girls.\r\n\r\n\"Not if you hurry,\" answered Nellie. \"But don't stay away after dark.\"\r\n\r\nLeft to themselves, the three girls swept up the chips the builders\r\nhad left and started up the camp-fire. Then they tidied up the house\r\ngenerally, and soon set about preparing the supper.\r\n\r\nDora was at the spring getting a pail of water when a sound on the\r\nrocks nearby caused her to look around in wonder. To her amazement\r\nDan Baxter stood there, staring at her in open-mouthed astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter!\" she gasped. \"Where in the world did you come from?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment the bully did not answer, so great was his amazement.\r\nDora noted that he was dirty and unkempt, and that his clothing was\r\nalmost in rags.\r\n\r\n\"Is it you, Dora Stanhope?\" came slowly from the fellow's lips. \"Is\r\nit really you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"How did you get here? Are you alone?\" went on Baxter, coming closer.\r\nAnd then before she could answer, he added: \"Got anything to eat?\"\r\n\r\nAt the last question she looked at him more closely, and saw that he\r\nappeared half starved. She pitied him despite his character.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we have plenty to eat,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Then give me something at once,\" he cried. \"Give me something at once!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come with me.\"\r\n\r\nThere was now a crashing in the bushes back of Dan Baxter, and in a\r\nsecond more Jack Lesher appeared on the scene. He too was haggard\r\nand dirty, and his eyes were much blood-shot, the result of living\r\nalmost entirely on liquor for several days after being wrecked on\r\nthe islands.\r\n\r\n\"Well, is it possible!\" cried the mate of the _Golden Wave_.\r\n\r\n\"They've got lots to eat,\" muttered Dan Baxter. \"I'm going to have\r\nsomething to fill me up before I start to talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many more of you are here?\" asked Dora, in something of dismay.\r\n\r\n\"We came along alone,\" said Baxter. \"Show us that grub.\"\r\n\r\nDora led the way to the camp-fire, where Nellie and Grace were also\r\nsurprised at the unexpected visitors. Some food was brought forth,\r\nand both Baxter and Lesher ate like two famished wolves.\r\n\r\n\"Got any liquor?\" questioned the mate, casting his eyes toward the house.\r\n\r\n\"We have a little,\" answered Nellie, for Captain Blossom had brought\r\nover several bottles from the wreck.\r\n\r\n\"Bring it out.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the liquor was brought Jack Lesher took a long draught and then\r\nhanded the bottle to Dan Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"That's the stuff!\" cried the mate, with a sly wink at Dora. \"Better\r\nthan eatin,' twice over,\" and he took another drink.\r\n\r\nThe manner of the two newcomers was not at all pleasing to the girls,\r\nand they were sorry that none of the men folks were at hand. They\r\nasked the pair to tell their story, and Baxter spoke up, while Lesher\r\napplied himself to the bottle.\r\n\r\n\"We floated around the ocean for several days,\" said the bully. \"One\r\nsailor went crazy from the sunshine and leaped overboard, and was\r\ndrowned. Then a heavy wind came up and drove the boat, in the night,\r\nonto an island close to this one. We were cast ashore with hardly\r\nany provisions, and two of the sailors were sick. We had to live on\r\nfish, birds, and fruit, and we've had a hard lot of it, I can tell\r\nyou that. Yesterday Lesher and I resolved to explore this island,\r\nthinking that perhaps some of the wreckage from the schooner had\r\nwashed ashore here. We came over in the afternoon and tramped along\r\nthe north shore until it grew dark, but without finding anything. We\r\nslept at the shore last night, and this morning started to go over\r\nthe hill back there. But the snakes chased us off, and then we came\r\naround over some rough rocks, where both of us got our clothing torn.\r\nWe thought we saw a flag up there somewhere, but we weren't sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we have a signal of distress up there,\" answered Dora. She\r\nhardly knew how best to reply.\r\n\r\n\"Who is here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Blossom, old Jerry Tolman, and the three Rover boys. Old\r\nJerry and Dick have just gone over to the wreck en an errand. The\r\nothers have gone on an exploring tour among the islands, which are\r\nseven in number.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got the wreck, have yer!\" came in almost a grunt from Jack Lesher.\r\n\"Sure enough!\" He staggered down to the beach. \"Don't see why you\r\nstay here when you might be aboard of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is cooler here,\" answered Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"How many sailors were saved?\" asked Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Nine were saved, besides Lesher and myself,\" answered Dan Baxter.\r\n\"You see, we picked up some of the men from one of the other boats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your party numbers eleven in all,\" said Dora.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" came from Jack Lesher. \"An' I am the cap'n of the lot,\" and\r\nhe bobbed his head in satisfaction. He had partaken of just enough\r\nliquor to make him foolish.\r\n\r\n\"I wish Dick and old Jerry would come back,\" whispered Grace to Dora.\r\n\"I do not like Mr. Lesher at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never liked him,\" replied Dora. \"When he gets intoxicated he is\r\na bad fellow to deal with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reckon we'll make ourselves comfortable here,\" said Lesher, staggering\r\nto a hammock Dick had put up for the girls to rest in. He pitched\r\ninto the hammock, carrying a bottle of liquor with him. Another drink\r\nwas taken, and soon he was fast asleep, snoring loudly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nHOT WORDS AND BLOWS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What a shame!\" said Nellie, pointing to the slumbering mate.\r\n\r\n\"That shows what liquor will do,\" came from Dora.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you mustn't blame him too much,\" returned Dan Baxter, who also\r\nliked the taste of the liquor. \"Remember that we have been living a\r\ndog's life since we came on shore, while you have been living on the\r\nbest the ship affords.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't touch liquor if I was starving!\" cried Grace.\r\n\r\n\"And neither would the Rover boys,\" added Dora.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you think the Rover boys are regular saints!\" grumbled the\r\nbully. \"You don't know what they would do behind your back.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they said they wouldn't drink they wouldn't,\" cried Nellie, her\r\neyes flashing. \"We can trust them every time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the Rover boys run this place to suit themselves,\" went\r\non Baxter, eying the house and the general appearance of the camp\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n\"We all run it together,\" came from Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't Captain Blossom, in command?\"\r\n\r\n\"After a fashion, yes. We haven't tried to decide that point yet.\r\nHave you a leader in your camp?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much of a one. Lesher is leader when he is sober. Of course\r\nwe'll all come over here, now we've found you and the wreck,\" went\r\non Dan Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"But why should you come here?\" asked Dora, not at all pleased by\r\nthe prospect. \"We can let you have your share of what's on board of\r\nthe schooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't want me here, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care for all of those rough sailors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they are Captain Blossom's men, you mustn't forget that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that is true,\" and Dora sighed. With the coming of the\r\nsailors she was certain the camp would not be as pleasant as formerly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you ought to be down on me, Dora,\" continued Dan\r\nBaxter, after a pause. \"I always liked you, and you know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for nothing,\" she replied coldly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just as good a fellow as Dick Rover,\" went on the bully, and\r\nlaid his hand on the girl's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Don't touch me, Dan Baxter!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"I won't hurt you. Come, let us be friends. Surely you don't want\r\nany enemies here, where there are only a handful of us, all told.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to leave me alone.\"\r\n\r\nShe tried to move away from him, but he caught her by the arm and\r\ntried to hold her hands. Grace and Nellie were out of sight, the one\r\nhaving gone into the house for some dishes, and the other to the\r\nspring for some water.\r\n\r\n\"Say that you'll be friends, and I'll let you go,\" he said, drawing\r\nher closer.\r\n\r\n\"I won't be friends with you, Dan Baxter, so there!\" she cried. \"Now\r\nlet me go!\" And she tried to push him away.\r\n\r\n\"You--you little cat!\" he cried, and then, as she let out a loud cry,\r\nhe let go of her. \"What a little fool you are!\" And he walked away\r\nto the trees, and threw himself down to rest.\r\n\r\nRed in the face and ready to cry, Dora ran into the house. Grace\r\nlooked at her in wonder.\r\n\r\n\"What is the trouble, Dora?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Dan Baxter try to--to--\"\r\n\r\n\"He wants to be--be friends!\" sobbed Dora. \"He held my hand so I\r\ncouldn't get away. Oh, how I despise him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just wait till Dick comes back; he'll make Baxter mind his own\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't tell him, Grace.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I shall, Dora. Baxter has got to keep his distance. I hate him\r\nmyself, and so does Nellie.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish he and Mr. Lesher had kept their distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think they will really come here--I mean all of the sailors?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than likely.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls continued their work, and for the time being Dan Baxter\r\nkept his distance. Jack Lesher continued to snore away in the hammock,\r\nnor did he rouse up when Dick and old Jerry returned.\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter!\" cried Dick, as he leaped from the rowboat. \"Where did\r\nyou come from?\" And then the story of the newcomers had to be told\r\nover again.\r\n\r\nDick eyed Jack Lesher with open disgust. \"A man who will act like\r\nthat has no welcome in our camp,\" he said to Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean you are going to turn him out,\" said the bully, in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"If he stays here he must behave himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget that he was the first mate of the schooner, Dick Rover.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not on the schooner now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but you are getting your living--or the largest part of it--from\r\nthe schooner.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Baxter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that it's the same as if you were on the schooner. And that\r\nbeing so, Mr. Lesher is the second in command here.\"\r\n\r\nAt this statement the girls looked alarmed, and even old Jerry's face\r\nshowed his uneasiness. But Dick's face was full of contempt.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that thing \"--pointing to the drunken mate--\"\r\nthat thing can command any of us? If you do, let me say right now\r\nthat you are mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that later.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is our camp, and it is not for you, the mate, or anybody else\r\nto come here and dictate to us. If you try that, we'll send you off\r\nin double-quick order.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and Dick and old Jerry began to unload the things\r\nthey had brought from the wreck. They had found a large cake of ice.\r\nBut the coming of Baxter and Jack Lesher had taken away the pleasure\r\nof making lemonade and orange ice, and the lump was placed in some\r\nwater to cool it for drinking purposes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Grace could get the chance she told Dick of the way Dan\r\nBaxter had treated Dora. At once Dick's face took on a stern look\r\nthat boded the bully no good.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have a talk with him and come to an understanding,\" said the\r\neldest Rover, and strode out of the house and to where Baxter was\r\nwalking up the beach, picking up fancy-colored sea-shells.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Baxter, I want to have an understanding with you,\" he\r\nsaid, catching the bully by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to promise to leave Dora Stanhope alone in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"How I treat her is none of your business,\" blustered the bully.\r\n\r\n\"But it is my business, Baxter.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, Dick Rover, I won't be bossed by you!\" howled the tall\r\nyouth. \"You mind your own business.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you touch her again, there will be trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you the worst thrashing you ever had in your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two can play at that game.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be only one in this game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to fight me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly willing,\" responded Dick recklessly. His anger was\r\ndeep at that moment.\r\n\r\n\"All right then, come on!\" howled Baxter savagely, and, squaring off,\r\nhe aimed a blow at Dick's face.\r\n\r\nThe attack was so sudden that Dick could scarcely prepare for it,\r\nand though he dodged, Baxter's fist landed glancingly on his cheek.\r\n\r\n\"There you are, and here's another!\" cried the bully, and his other\r\nfist shot out, catching Dick on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nBut now the oldest Rover was on his guard, and in a twinkle he let\r\ndrive, taking Dan Baxter in the eye. It was a staggering blow, and\r\nmade the bully gasp with pain. Then Dick followed it up by a crashing\r\nblow on the chin, which sent the bully reeling into the low water on\r\nthe beach.\r\n\r\n\"Don't--don't run me into the ocean!\" he spluttered, and, watching\r\nhis chance, ran out of the water and up the beach.\r\n\r\nBut Dick was now thoroughly aroused, and he made after Baxter. When\r\nhe got close enough, he put out his foot and sent the bully sprawling.\r\nBaxter came down on some rough sea-shells, cutting his face and hands\r\nin several places.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh!\" he howled. \"Stop it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not stop it, Dan Baxter, until you promise to let Dora Stanhope\r\nand the other girls alone in the future. They want nothing to do with\r\nyou, and you must keep your distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I didn't hurt anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you promise to let them alone?\"\r\n\r\nWithout replying, the bully staggered to his feet. The blood was\r\nrunning from his nose and from a cut on his chin, and both of his\r\nhands were also bleeding.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to kill me, Dick Rover?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to behave yourself. Come, now, are you going to promise?\"\r\n\r\n\"What if I don't?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll give you the thrashing I promised.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I'm cornered, and can't help myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you let the girls alone in the future?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. If they don't want to be friends, I'm sure I can get along\r\nwithout them,\" answered Baxter sulkily.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; now see that you keep your promise. If you don't, I'll\r\nrun you out of camp and never let you come near us again.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words Dick turned on his heel and walked away, leaving\r\nBaxter to wash his cuts and bruises in the ocean and otherwise care\r\nfor them as best he could.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE MATE TRIES TO TAKE COMMAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fight had taken place around a bend of the shore, so that it was\r\nnot observed by old Jerry and the girls. But when Dick got back to\r\ncamp Dora at once noticed that something unusual had happened.\r\n\r\n\"What is wrong, Dick?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing much, Dora. I merely made Dan Baxter promise to keep\r\nhis distance in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you have a fight?\"\r\n\r\n\"It didn't amount to much. He had to give in pretty quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dick!\" She caught his arm.\r\n\r\n\"I won't have him annoying you, or the others, Dora.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are so good!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nSupper was ready, and they sat down, leaving Jack Lesher still in\r\nthe hammock. They had nearly finished when Dan Baxter came shuffling\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want some supper?\" asked Dick. \"If you do, come on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want anything more to-night,\" growled the bully, and sat\r\ndown beside Jack Lesher.\r\n\r\nIt was rather an uncomfortable evening. The thoughts of each of the\r\nparty were busy. At the first opportunity Dick called old Jerry to\r\none side.\r\n\r\n\"Jerry, we must watch those two fellows closely,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Right ye are, Dick.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid Lesher will be ugly when he wakes up.\"\r\n\r\n\"More'n likely, lad--he always was on board ship. The drink gives\r\nhim an awful temper.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, going to put the liquor where he can't get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll make ye give it to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will he? Just you wait and see,\" replied Dick firmly.\r\n\r\nIt was decided to let Lesher rest in the hammock all night. Baxter\r\nwas given a cot in the living room of the house. Soon all had retired,\r\nand the camp was quiet for the night.\r\n\r\nDan Baxter was the first to stir in the morning. His cuts smarted so\r\nhe could not sleep, and he walked out to bathe them and put on some\r\nsalve Nellie had generously turned over to him. He found Jack Lesher\r\nstirring.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" grumbled the mate, sitting up and yawning. \"Where am I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know we struck camp?\" answered Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I remember now. Got some good liquor, too. Where is that\r\nbottle?\"\r\n\r\n\"You emptied it, Lesher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I? Too bad! I'll have to find another. Where are the girls?\"\r\n\r\n\"Asleep in the house, and so are Dick Rover and old Jerry Tolman.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of Cap'n Blossom and them other Rover boys?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are not expected back for several days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! Say, I feel bad, I do. I must have something to brace me up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better not disturb them, Lesher. They are mighty stiff-necked\r\nsince they landed here.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"They gave me to understand yesterday that they were going to run\r\nthings to suit themselves. They are not going to let us interfere in\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like that!\" The mate yawned again, rose, and stretched himself.\r\n\"Baxter, do you know where they keep the liquor?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm bound to have what I want. Didn't it all come from the Golden\r\nWave, and aint I the first mate of that craft?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure you are, Lesher.\"\r\n\r\n\"They can't make me take a back seat,\" went on the mate. His head\r\nwas still far from clear.\r\n\r\n\"I told them that you were second in command--Captain Blossom being\r\nfirst--but they wouldn't listen. They said they were on land, and\r\nyou didn't count.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't I count!\" cried Jack Lesher, his blood-shot eyes taking on an\r\nugly look. \"I'll show 'em!\"\r\n\r\nJust then old Jerry came from the house. Jack Lesher staggered toward\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Ahoy there!\" he called out.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want, Mr. Lesher?\" questioned old Jerry, and touched\r\nhis forelock.\r\n\r\n\"Bring me some liquor, and be quick about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any liquor.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said I haven't any liquor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aint there any more liquor ashore?\"\r\n\r\n\"If there is, I don't know where it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then find out, and be quick about it, or I'll give you the rope's-end!\"\r\nroared the unreasonable mate.\r\n\r\nThe loud talking aroused Dick, and he soon came out.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter here?\" he asked. \"Oh, so you have woke up,\" he\r\nwent on to Jack Lesher.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm awake, Rover. And I want to know where the liquor has been\r\nplaced.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's been placed where you won't get hold of it, Mr. Lesher.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! This to me!\" yelled the mate, in fury. \"To me, the first mate!\"\r\n\r\n\"A first mate doesn't count for anything here. This is a private\r\ncamp, and if you don't behave yourself we'll pitch you out of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You--you--\" Jack Lesher could not go on, and shook his fist in Dick's\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"I told you what they intended to do,\" whispered Dan Baxter in\r\nLesher's ear. \"They have the upper hand and mean to keep it. But\r\ndon't forget that we have nine sailors in our camp to back us up,\"\r\nhe went on suggestively.\r\n\r\n\"Don't grow abusive, Mr. Lesher,\" said Dick as calmly as he could.\r\n\"Just think the matter over. It may save a good deal of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't have to think it over!\" bellowed the mate. \"During Cap'n\r\nBlossom's absence I am in command, just as much as if we were on the\r\ndeck of the wreck over there. You were only passengers, but Jerry\r\nTolman was a sailor, and he's under my command. I told him to bring\r\nme some liquor, and he has got to do it. If he won't obey, it's\r\nmutiny, just you remember that!\" And he shook his finger warningly\r\nin old Jerry's face.\r\n\r\n\"I told ye I don't know where the liquor is,\" answered old Jerry\r\ndoggedly.\r\n\r\n\"And he tells the truth,\" said Dick. \"I put it away myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I command you to bring it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you before your commands don't hold water here. Even old\r\nJerry hasn't got to obey you. When the _Golden Wave_ was abandoned that\r\nended your authority. We have simply made Captain Blossom our leader\r\nbecause he acted fair and square. But we don't have to obey him if\r\nwe don't want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of the nine sailors who are with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll be pleased to give them their full share of what is on the\r\nwreck, and if they behave themselves they can build a camp right\r\nnext to this one. But you must remember that we discovered the wreck\r\nfirst, and that Captain Blossom was the only man left on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see what the men have to say about this,\" growled Lesher.\r\n\"Then you aint going to give me no liquor?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can have one glass with your breakfast, and that is all. After\r\nthis you can have the regulation ship's grog, with the other sailors.\r\nBut getting drunk has got to be stopped, even if we have to dump all\r\nthe liquor into the ocean.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the girls had appeared on the scene, and the talk came\r\nto an end, Dick turning in to help get breakfast. Jack Lesher walked\r\ndown to the beach, followed by Dan Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"You see, it is just as I told you,\" said Baxter. \"They are going to\r\nride right over us.\"\r\n\r\n\"They wouldn't ride over us if I had those other sailors here,\"\r\ngrowled the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Or if we were armed,\" went on the bully. \"I tried to get hold of a\r\npistol, but Dick Rover watches me like a cat watches a mouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we could get to the wreck we might arm ourselves,\" said Lesher.\r\n\"Here is a boat; let us row over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm willing,\" answered the bully.\r\n\r\nThey walked to the boat, shoved it into the water, and leaped in.\r\nJust as Lesher picked up the oars Dick saw what they were doing.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" growled the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Over to the wreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is our business,\" put in Dan Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"You shan't go over there until Captain Blossom comes back.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll go when we please,\" said Lesher, and started to row away.\r\n\r\n\"Come back, I say!\" cried Dick, and, rushing into the house, he\r\nappeared with a shot-gun.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do, Dick Rover?\" questioned Baxter in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to make you come back,\" was the oldest Rover's very quiet,\r\nbut determined, answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE ATTACK ON THE WRECK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Dick with the shot-gun disturbed Jack Lesher quite\r\nas much as it did Dan Baxter, and the mate stopped rowing instantly.\r\n\r\n\"Hi! don't you fire at us!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Then come back here,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't I a right to visit the wreck?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not sure that you have. Anyway, you must wait until Captain\r\nBlossom returns.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that you are carrying matters with a high hand, young\r\nfellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dick, be careful!\" whispered Dora. \"They may become desperate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, Dora,\" he whispered in return. Unless I miss my guess,\r\none is as big a coward as the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope ye aint goin' too far, Dick,\" said old Jerry, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you intend to stand by me, Jerry?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure I do; but the mate is the mate, ye know.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an uncertain pause all around.\r\n\r\n\"There is no harm in my visiting the wreck,\" growled Jack Lesher\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not, but you had better wait until Captain Blossom gets back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only want to get some things that belong to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I want to get my extra clothes,\" said Baxter. \"These are in\r\nrags, as you can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then wait until after breakfast and we'll all go over,\" said Dick,\r\nbut he had scarcely spoken when he felt sorry for the words.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dick, don't trust yourself with them!\" cautioned Dora.\r\n\r\n\"We want to hurry, for I want to go back to where I left the sailors\r\nbefore night,\" answered Lesher.\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll have breakfast at once.\"\r\n\r\nRather reluctantly the mate turned back to the shore and he and Baxter\r\nleft the boat. Then the girls prepared breakfast with all haste.\r\nLesher ate but little, but eagerly tossed off the glass of liquor\r\nDick allowed him.\r\n\r\n\"Give me one more,\" he pleaded, but Dick was firm, and the mate\r\nstalked away muttering under his breath.\r\n\r\nBefore Dick entered the rowboat he called Jerry aside, and handed\r\nthe old sailor a pistol.\r\n\r\n\"We had better go armed,\" he said. \"Keep your eyes open, for they\r\nmay try to play us a foul trick. And don't let Lesher talk you into\r\nobeying him. He has no authority whatever over you.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Dick, I'll stand by ye always from this minit on,\" said\r\nJerry, and the compact was sealed by a handshake.\r\n\r\nThe girls came down to see them off, and Dora warned Dick again to\r\nbe on guard. It was decided that Lesher and old Jerry should do the\r\nrowing. Baxter sat in the bow of the boat, and Dick in the stern.\r\n\r\nThe trip to the wreck was accomplished in almost utter silence.\r\nEverybody was busy with his thoughts. As they drew near Dick showed\r\nthe mate where a ladder hung from the side, and as they drew close\r\nto this Baxter was the first to mount to the deck.\r\n\r\nAs Dick had surmised, Lesher's first hunt was for liquor, and he\r\ndrank several glasses at a gulp. Then he began to roam around the\r\nwreck, noting the damage that had been done and the amount of stores\r\nstill on board.\r\n\r\n\"Might float her, if the tide got extra high,\" he said. \"Eleven men\r\nin our crowd and five in your own ought to be able to do something,\r\nsurely.\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain says the ship is too deep in the sand,\" answered Dick\r\nbriefly.\r\n\r\n\"Blossom don't know everything,\" growled the mate.\r\n\r\nBoth he and Baxter soon found some comfortable clothing, and put it\r\non. Then they made up a bundle of things they said the other sailors\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nWhen arming themselves, the Rovers and Captain Blossom had placed\r\nall of the remaining firearms in a stateroom and locked the door.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do with all of the guns and pistols?\" asked Lesher\r\npresently, after looking in vain for them.\r\n\r\n\"They are packed away in a stateroom. Captain Blossom thought it\r\nwouldn't do to leave them lying loose. Some savages might come to\r\nthe islands and steal them, and then we'd be in a bad hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got to have some guns and pistols, Rover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can see the captain about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shan't wait. Which stateroom are they in?\"\r\n\r\nDick would not tell the mate, and Lesher went around trying the\r\nvarious doors. Coming to one that was locked he burst it open with\r\nhis shoulder.\r\n\r\nDick scarcely knew what to do, and while he was trying to make up\r\nhis mind Jack Lesher secured a pistol and a rifle, and also a pistol\r\nfor Dan Baxter. He would have taken more fire-arms, but Dick stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"That is enough,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I want some for the men,\" said the first mate.\r\n\r\n\"They can get pistols from Captain Blossom when they get here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! You think you are in sole command, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to allow you to take away all the firearms that are\r\nhere, Mr. Lesher.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see:\"\r\n\r\nThe mate went into the pantry and secured another glass of liquor.\r\nThen he ordered old Jerry to take the bundle of clothing and put it\r\nin the rowboat.\r\n\r\n\"I've got some money on this schooner,\" he said. \"I want to see if\r\nthat's safe, or if you have stolen it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't touched any money,\" answered Dick, his face flushing.\r\n\"It would be of no use to us on these islands.\"\r\n\r\n\"You come with me while I take a look,\" said Lesher.\r\n\r\nBehind his back he waved his hand for Baxter to follow. All three\r\nwent below again, and into a stateroom the mate had occupied.\r\n\r\n\"The money was in that chest,\" said the mate. He threw open the lid.\r\n\"It's gone!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nInterested for the moment, Dick bent forward to look in the chest.\r\nAs he did so, Lesher suddenly hit him a savage blow over the head\r\nwith the butt of a pistol. The blow was a heavy one, and Dick fell\r\nlike a log to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" came from Baxter. \"Have you killed him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; only knocked the senses out of him,\" answered Lesher, bending\r\nover his victim.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do it for?\"\r\n\r\n\"To teach him a lesson. He shan't boss me, Baxter. Come, help me put\r\nhim in the brig, and be quick, before Jerry comes back.\"\r\n\r\nThey lifted up the insensible form and made their way to where the\r\nship's brig was located, a dirty closet once used for oil and lanterns.\r\nDick was thrown on the floor, and the mate shut the door on him and\r\nlocked it.\r\n\r\n\"Now he can stay there for a day or two,\" he snarled. \"Reckon it will\r\nteach him a lesson.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do with the sailor?\"\r\n\r\nBefore Lesher could answer old Jerry appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Dick Rover?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"None of your business,\" growled Jack Lesher. \"See here, Tolman, are\r\nyou going to obey me after this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know where Dick is?\" said old Jerry stubbornly.\r\n\r\n\"I put him in the brig to cool off. He's too hot-headed for his own\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had no right to lock him up, Mr. Lesher. You must let him out\r\nat once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Git out of here, quick!\" roared Lesher. \"On deck, or I'll flog you\r\nwell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye won't tech me!\" cried Jerry, his temper rising. \"I aint under\r\norders no more, mind that. Now you let him out, or I'll do it. You\r\nwas a fool to lock him up in the first place.\"\r\n\r\nHe moved toward the brig, but Lesher caught him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Let's teach this chap a lesson, too!\" came from Baxter, and, like\r\na flash, he struck old Jerry in the back of the head. The first blow\r\nwas followed by a second, and down went the tar, the blood oozing\r\nfrom one of his wounds.\r\n\r\n\"Don't hit him again!\" cried Lesher hastily. \"He's out already.\"\r\n\r\nBaxter grew pale, thinking he had gone too far. But he soon discovered\r\nthat Jerry still breathed, and then he felt relieved.\r\n\r\nIt was decided by the pair that they should place old Jerry beside\r\nDick in the brig, and this was quickly done. Then they put into the\r\nprison a bucket of drinking water and a can of ship's biscuits, and\r\nanother of baked beans.\r\n\r\n\"They won't starve on that,\" said Lesher. \"And when they get out\r\nthey'll understand that I am as much of a master here as anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"It serves Dick Rover right,\" said Baxter. \"He's the kind that ought\r\nto be kept under foot all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nA HEAVY TROPICAL STORM\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Those girls will ask some awkward questions, I reckon,\" said Jack\r\nLesher, as the two prepared to leave the wreck.\r\n\r\n\"We had better not say too much,\" answered Baxter.\r\n\r\nThey were soon over the side and in the rowboat, which contained\r\nthe bundle of clothing and a number of other articles. Then an idea\r\nstruck the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Wait; I am going back,\" he said, and disappeared on the deck one more.\r\n\r\nDan Baxter imagined that Lesher had gone for more liquor. But he was\r\nmistaken. When the mate reappeared, he carried a box containing half\r\na dozen pistols, two guns, and a quantity of ammunition.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to hide this in the woods on the other side of this\r\nisland,\" he said. \"The firearms may come in handy before long.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good idea,\" replied Baxter, and helped him place the case in a\r\ndesirable spot, under some rocks, where the rain could not touch it.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to have a storm before long,\" said the mate, as they\r\nstarted to row back to the camp. \"And if it is a heavy one we'll have\r\nto wait till it clears off before we rejoin the rest of our crowd.\"\r\n\r\nThe sky was growing dark, and by the time the beach in front of the\r\nhouse was gained the rain was falling.\r\n\r\n\"Where are Dick and, old Jerry?\" asked Dora in quick alarm. She had\r\nnoted long before that only Baxter and the mate were in the rowboat.\r\n\r\n\"They stayed behind on the wreck,\" answered Lesher. \"Come, help get\r\nthe bundles out of the wet,\" he added to his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Why did they stay?\" asked Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask me,\" growled Lesher.\r\n\r\nHe and Baxter took the bundle to the house and dumped it on the floor\r\nof the living room. Then they brought in the other things from the\r\nboat. By this time it was raining in torrents, and from a distance\r\ncame the rumble of thunder and occasionally the faint flash of lightning.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to remain out in the storm, the three girls came into\r\nthe house.--\"Dora was very much disturbed, and Nellie and Grace were\r\nalso anxious.\r\n\r\n\"It is queer that Dick and old Jerry remained behind,\" whispered Dora\r\nto her cousins. \"They were so anxious to protect us before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot understand it, Dora,\" returned Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"There has been foul play somewhere,\" came from Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you think--\" Dora could not finish.\r\n\r\n\"See here!\" burst in the voice of Jack Lesher. \"We want some dinner.\r\nDon't be all day getting it for us.\"\r\n\r\nThe liquor he had imbibed was beginning to tell upon him.. He looked\r\nugly, and the girls trembled before him.\r\n\r\n\"Dinner will be ready in a quarter of an hour,\" said Grace, who had\r\nbeen doing the cooking.\r\n\r\n\"All right.\" Lesher turned to the bully: \"Baxter, join me in a glass\r\nof rum for luck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, I will,\" answered Dan Baxter, who did not particularly want\r\nthe liquor, but did not dream of offending the mate.\r\n\r\nLesher produced a bottle he had brought away from the wreck, prepared\r\ntwo glasses of rum, and drank with great relish. Then he threw himself\r\ninto a chair at the rude dining-table.\r\n\r\n\"I am the master here, and I want everybody to know it!\" he exclaimed,\r\nbanging his fist savagely.\r\n\r\n\"There is dinner,\" said Grace, and brought it in. \"You can help\r\nyourself.\" And she went into the next room to join Nellie and Dora.\r\n\r\n\"Aint going to wait on us, eh?\" grumbled Lesher, with a hiccough.\r\n\"All right, my fine ladies. But I am master, don't you forget that!\"\r\n\r\nHe began to eat leisurely, while Dan Baxter began to bolt his food.\r\nIn the meantime the sky grew darker and the flashes of lightning more\r\nvivid. The girls were greatly frightened, and huddled together, while\r\ntears stood on Grace's cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if only somebody was with us,\" sighed Nellie.\r\n\r\nBy the time Lesher and Baxter had finished eating the storm was on\r\nthem in all of its violence. The wind shrieked and tore through the\r\njungle behind them, and often they could hear some tall tree go down\r\nwith a crash.\r\n\r\n\"This will tear our flag of distress to shreds,\" said Nellie. \"And\r\njust when we need it so much, too!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking of the future as well as the present,\" said Dora.\r\n\"What a rough time there will be if Lesher brings those other sailors\r\nhere. Some of them were heavy drinkers like himself, and only two or\r\nthree were Americans.\"\r\n\r\nThe storm had whipped the waters of the bay into a fury, and the rain\r\nwas so thick that to see even the island on which the wreck rested\r\nwas impossible.\r\n\r\n\"Dick can't come now,\" said Dora. \"A boat on the bay would surely go\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\nHaving finished the meal, Lesher and Baxter sat down in the living\r\nroom to smoke and to talk over the situation. The mate continued to\r\ndrink, and half an hour later he fell asleep, sitting on the bench,\r\nand with his head on the table.\r\n\r\n\"The beast!\" said Dora, as she peeped out at him. \"Well, there is\r\none satisfaction,\" she continued: \"he cannot harm us while he is\r\nasleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"You girls better have your own dinner,\" called out Baxter. \"I aint\r\ngoing to eat you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will get our dinner when we please,\" said Nellie, as she came\r\nout. \"We are not afraid of you, Dan Baxter.\"\r\n\r\nNo more was said for a long time. The girls ate what little they\r\nwished and washed up the dishes. The rain still continued to fall in\r\ntorrents, but the thunder and' lightning drifted away to the eastward.\r\n\r\nDora was the most anxious of the trio, and at every opportunity she\r\ntried to look through the driving rain toward the wreck.\r\n\r\n\"I'd give almost anything to know if Dick is safe,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be discouraged, Dora,\" said Grace. \"Perhaps he will return as\r\nsoon as the storm is over.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls were huddled close to a window, looking out into the rain,\r\nwhen Dan Baxter threw aside the pipe he had been smoking and approached\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"See here, girls,\" he said, \"why can't we be friends? What is the\r\nuse of being enemies in such a place as this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter, we want you to keep your distance,\" said Nellie coldly.\r\n\r\n\"And if you do not, it will be the worse for you when the others come\r\nback,\" put in Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Humph! I reckon you think it is fine to ride such a high horse,\"\r\nsneered the bully. \"What are you going to do when we bring the rest\r\nof the sailors over here? We'll be eleven to seven then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind what we'll do,\" said Dora. \"I would rather have the\r\ncompany of some of those sailors than your company.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is where you make a mistake. The sailors are all rough fellows,\r\nsome of them worse than Jack Lesher. Now, if you are willing to count\r\nme as a friend, I'll stand by you when the crowd comes over.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't want your friendship, Dan Baxter, so there!\" cried Nellie.\r\n\"We know your past, and we know that you cannot be trusted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't think I am as good as the Rovers, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"We all know that you are not,\" answered Grace.\r\n\r\n\"What have you done to Dick Rover?\" questioned Dora. \"He ought to be\r\nhere long before this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I guess the storm is holding him back,\" said Baxter, shifting\r\nuneasily as she gazed earnestly into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"If anything has happened to Dick, I shall hold you responsible,\"\r\nsaid Dora.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the fury of the storm cut off further talking. A sudden\r\nrush of wind had come up, whistling through the jungle and bringing\r\ndown a palm close to the house with a crash. The fall of the tree\r\nmade Baxter jump in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"The house is coming down!\" he cried, and ran outside.\r\n\r\nThe wind made the waves in the bay rise higher and higher until they\r\nlashed furiously in all directions. Then came another downpour of\r\nrain, which caused the bully to seek shelter again.\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\" said Nellie suddenly, and raised her hand for silence.\r\n\r\n\"What did you hear?\" asked Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody calling. Listen!\"\r\n\r\nAll were silent once more, and just then the wind fell a little.\r\n\r\n\"I don't hear anything,\" said Dora.\r\n\r\nBut then followed a distant voice--two voices calling desperately:\r\n\r\n\"Help! help! Our boat is sinking! Help!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENED ON THE BAY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo go back to Tom, Sam, and Captain Blossom at the time that they\r\nplaced the two dead goats in their rowboat and prepared to return to\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nIt was already raining by the time the shore of the bay was reached,\r\nand scarcely had they begun to row when the water came pouring down\r\nin torrents.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious! I must say I don't like this!\" cried Tom. \"The rain is\r\nrunning down my neck in a stream.\"\r\n\r\n\"I move we row into shore over yonder,\" said Sam, pointing up the\r\ncoast. \"There are some trees which will shelter both us and the boat\r\nnicely.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Blossom was willing, and in a few minutes they were under\r\nthe trees and wringing out their clothes as best they could.\r\n\r\n\"If I know anything about it, this storm is going to last for some\r\ntime,\" said the captain, after a long look at the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Such a downfall as this can't last,\" said Sam. \"Perhaps we can get\r\nhome between showers.\"\r\n\r\nIt was dry under the trees for about half an hour, but then the water\r\nbegan to reach them once more, and they had to shift their position\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThis kept up for some time, until all were wet through and thoroughly\r\nuncomfortable, when Tom proposed that they start for home regardless\r\nof the storm.\r\n\r\n\"We can't get any wetter than we are,\" he declared. \"And the sooner\r\nwe reach the house the sooner we'll be able to change our clothes.\"\r\n\r\nThe others agreed, and when the worst of the lightning and thunder\r\nhad passed they set off once more, two rowing and the third steering\r\nthe boat and bailing out the water, which came in faster than was\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n\"When it rains in the tropics, it rains,\" observed Tom. \"Puts me in\r\nmind of that storm we met when we were in Africa. Do you remember, Sam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I do,\" answered his brother. \"I thought we'd all be killed\r\nby the trees that fell in the jungle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been in Africa?\" came from Captain Blossom in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Tom. \"Our father got lost there once, and we went in\r\nsearch of him,\" and he gave a few of the particulars, as already\r\nrelated in another volume of this series, entitled \"The Rover Boys\r\nin the Jungle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you boys have had some ups and downs,\" said the captain. \"But\r\nI reckon you weren't cast away before like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not like this,\" answered Sam. \"But we were left on a lonely island\r\nonce in Lake Huron,\" and he related a few particulars of their exciting\r\nexperiences with the Baxters while on the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\nAnother downpour of rain cut off the talking, and Tom was kept busy\r\nbailing out the row-boat. With three persons and the two dead goats\r\nthe craft was pretty heavily loaded, and more than once the rising\r\nwind swept some water over the bow.\r\n\r\n\"I'd give a little to be ashore again,\" said Tom presently. \"It seems\r\nto me that the rain is shutting out everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to land again, lads,\" put in the captain, with a grave\r\nshake of his head. \"This wind is growing worse. We don't want to be\r\nswamped.\"\r\n\r\nThey turned to what they thought must be the direction of the nearest\r\nshore, but though they pulled with might and main for nearly quarter\r\nof an hour no land appeared.\r\n\r\n\"We're mixed,\" cried Sam. \"The storm has twisted us up.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the wind was blowing a regular gale on the bay. It took\r\noff Tom's cap, and in a twinkle the headgear was out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"My cap's gone!\" groaned the youth.\r\n\r\n\"The water is coming in over the bow!\" came from Sam. \"We will be\r\nswamped!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must throw the goats overboard,\" said the captain, and overboard\r\nwent the game, much to the boys' sorrow.\r\n\r\nThis lightened the craft a little, but still the waves swept over\r\nthe gunwale, and now both Sam and Tom set to bailing, while the\r\ncaptain took both oars. Then came another blast of wind, worse than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"I see land!\" cried Sam.\r\n\r\n\"We are going over!\" yelled Tom, and the wind fairly whipped the\r\nwords from his lips. Then came a mighty wave, and on the instant the\r\nrowboat was upset, and all three found themselves in the waters of\r\nthe bay.\r\n\r\nAs they went under the same thought was in the mind of each: Were\r\nthere any sharks around?\r\n\r\n\"Help! help!\" cried Sam, as soon as he came up. \"Our boat is sinking.\r\nHelp!\" And Tom soon joined in the cry. They had caught hold of the\r\noverturned boat, but the craft, for some reason, failed to support them.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blossom was close at hand, and he advised them to strike out\r\nfor the shore.\r\n\r\n\"It's in this direction,\" he said, and led the way.\r\n\r\n\"I--I can't swim very far with my clothes on,\" gasped Sam, yet he\r\nstruck out as best he could.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo! Who calls?\" came a cry from the shore, and, looking up, they\r\nsaw Dora standing there, with Nellie and Grace Laning close beside her.\r\n\r\n\"It's Tom and Sam!\" cried Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"And Captain Blossom,\" added Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we can throw them a rope,\" came from Dora, and she ran to\r\nget the article she had mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut by the time she returned the three swimmers had reached a point\r\nwhere they could touch bottom with their feet, and, watching for a\r\nfavorable opportunity, they rushed ashore, almost into the arms of\r\nthe girls.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom, how glad I am that you are safe!\" cried Nellie, while Grace\r\ncaught hold of Sam and asked if he was all right.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am--am all right, but--but pretty well fagged out,\" gasped Sam.\r\n\r\n\"It was a close shave,\" said Captain Blossom. \"And our guns are gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had two dead goats, too,\" put in Tom. \"They went overboard first,\r\nand--goodness gracious--is that really Dan Baxter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter!\" ejaculated Sam, and even Captain Blossom stared in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n\"I see you've had a rough time of it,\" said Baxter, coming forward\r\ncoolly. \"How are you?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with Captain Blossom, while the Rover boys continued\r\nto stare at him.\r\n\r\n\"Are you alone?\" asked the master of the _Golden Wave_.\r\n\r\n\"No, Jack Lesher is with me, and we left nine of the sailors on\r\nanother island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that so? Where is Lesher now?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the house, asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is intoxicated,\" said Nellie. \"We has been drinking ever since\r\nhe put in an appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! That's like Lesher,\" muttered the captain, and his brow darkened.\r\n\r\nAll moved toward the house, and entered to get out of the wet. The\r\nmate was still at the table, snoring loudly.\r\n\r\n\"Might as well let him sleep it off,\" said the captain. \"But when he\r\nis sober I'll have a talk with him.\"\r\n\r\nWet clothing was changed for dry, and then the captain and the boys\r\nlistened to what Baxter and the girls had to tell. The captain was\r\nglad to learn that so many of his men had been saved, and asked for\r\nthe names.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care much about Peterson and McGlow,\" he said. \"They are\r\ntough customers. I would rather have heard from Peabody, Dickson,\r\nand Fearwell. You don't know anything about them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Dan Baxter.\r\n\r\n\"This news about Dick and old Jerry worries me,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter, I think you know more than you care to tell,\" said Sam\r\nboldly.\r\n\r\nThe bully hardly knew how to reply. He could not now fall back on\r\nJack Lesher for support, and he had thought to be on his way to\r\nrejoin the sailors ere this. The storm had upset all of his calculations.\r\nIt had been a foolish movement to attack Dick and old Jerry, and it\r\nnow looked as if he must suffer for it.\r\n\r\n\"Well--er--I don't mind telling you that Dick and the mate had\r\nsomething of a quarrel,\" he said hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"How did it end?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I can't say exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? You were with Lesher at the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I wasn't. He ordered me to get into the rowboat and wait for\r\nhim while he went back to get a pistol or a gun. I heard loud talking\r\non the deck of the schooner, and I knew a row was on. I was just\r\ngoing back to the deck when the mate came and leaped into the rowboat.\r\nHe said the sailor and Dick were going to remain behind, and that we\r\nwouldn't wait any longer. Then we rowed over here.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's the case I'll make Lesher tell us what happened,\" cried\r\nTom, and shook the mate roughly. \"Wake up here!\" he cried. \"Wake up\r\nand give an account of yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nIN CLOSE QUARTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly Dick came to his senses. He remembered little or nothing, and\r\nonly knew that all was dark around him, and that his head was spinning\r\nlike a top.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes he remained quiet, trying to collect his thoughts.\r\nThen he sat up and passed one hand slowly over his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how my heed aches!\" he murmured.\r\n\r\nIt was fully five minutes before he felt like moving around. Then he\r\narose and took a step forward and stumbled over old Jerry's body.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he murmured, and felt of the body in the dark, \"Who is this?\r\nCan it be Jerry?\" he asked himself.\r\n\r\nThen came a recollection of the cowardly attack. But what had followed\r\nwas a blank, and he could not imagine where he was.\r\n\r\nDick remembered that he had a match safe in his pocket, and soon he\r\nmade a light. By this he caught sight of a lantern in the brig and\r\nlit it. Then he bent over old Jerry, and saw that the sailor was\r\nstill alive, but suffering from his treatment.\r\n\r\n\"He must have been attacked, too,\" murmured Dick. The bucket of water\r\nwas at hand, And he took a drink and bathed Captain Jerry's forehead.\r\n\r\nIt was fully half an hour before the old sailor felt at all like\r\nhimself. Both sat down to review the situation.\r\n\r\n\"The cowards!\" said Dick. \"What do you suppose they attacked us for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say as to that,\" replied old Jerry. \"Perhaps Lesher wanted to\r\nshow us he was master.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll settle with me if I ever get out of this hole, Jerry. What\r\nplace is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"The lock-up of the _Golden Wave_. I think it used to be an oil room.\"\r\n\r\nThey gazed around them, and soon discovered the can of ship's biscuits\r\nand also the beans.\r\n\r\n\"They evidently meant to keep us prisoners for some time,\" said Dick.\r\n\"Hark, what is that?\"\r\n\r\nBoth listened, and made out the sounds of distant thunder and heard\r\nthe patter of rain on the deck.\r\n\r\n\"A storm is brewing,\" said old Jerry. \"It sounds as if it was putty\r\nheavy, too.\"\r\n\r\nThey tried the door to the brig, but found it locked and bolted. In\r\nvain Dick kicked against it, and shoved with his shoulder. It refused\r\nto budge.\r\n\r\n\"This looks as if we'd have to stay here--at least for the present,\"\r\nsaid Dick, with a sigh. \"I must say I don't like the prospect.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long do ye calculate we've been here, lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no telling, unless by my watch.\" But when he looked at the\r\ntimepiece, he found that it had stopped.\r\n\r\nThey ate some of the biscuits and drank some water and rested for a\r\nwhile longer. Outside the wind blew furiously and they heard the rain\r\nand the waves dash in all directions. Then some water came trickling\r\nin slowly, at one corner.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me as if the wreck was shifting,\" cried Dick presently.\r\n\r\n\"It won't shift very far in this bed o' sand, lad. But she may break\r\nup and go to pieces,\" added old Jerry.\r\n\r\n\"If she goes down, we'll be drowned like rats in a trap,\" said Dick.\r\n\"We must get out somehow.\"\r\n\r\nThey talked the matter over and began a systematic examination of\r\ntheir prison. The four walls were solid and so was the ceiling above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"The flooring has a couple of loose planks in it,\" announced. Dick.\r\n\"If we can get them up, where will the opening lead to?\"\r\n\r\n\"The forward hold, lad, and that is now half full of sand and water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, I'm going to get the planks up if I can.\"\r\n\r\nWith his head still aching Dick set to work and old Jerry helped him.\r\nIt was no easy matter to shift the heavy planking, but after a while\r\nthey got one plank up and then used this as a pry to bring up the second.\r\n\r\nA dark hole was revealed, covered at the bottom with water. Then Dick\r\ntook the lantern and let himself down cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"The water is only about a foot deep,\" he announced. \"I'm going to\r\nmake a search around with the lantern.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, I'll go with ye,\" cried old Jerry, and came down with a splash.\r\n\r\nWith great caution they moved around the hold, wading through sand\r\nand water, and climbing over boxes, barrels, and crates.\r\n\r\n\"What a mixture of cargo,\" said Dick. \"And what a pity so much of it\r\nis going to ruin,\" and he pointed to some valuable mining machinery\r\nwhich was rusting in the salt water.\r\n\r\nFortunately old Jerry had been in the hold before the _Golden Wave_\r\nwas wrecked, so he knew something of the surroundings. He led the\r\nway to some boxes directly beneath the forward hatch.\r\n\r\n\"I don't reckon the hatch is fastened down,\" he said. \"An' if it aint\r\nwe may be able to shove it up by standing one box on top of another.\"\r\n\r\nThis was tried, and after much difficulty the hatch was thrown to\r\none side, and they crawled to the deck of the schooner.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad I am out of that!\" ejaculated Dick. \"But how it's raining!\r\nLet us go to the cabin for shelter.\"\r\n\r\nOnce in the cabin they proceeded to make themselves as comfortable\r\nas the state of affairs permitted.\r\n\r\n\"With no boat it is going to be no easy matter getting back to the\r\nhouse,\" said Dick. He was much worried concerning the girls.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to stay here until the storm is over,\" said old Jerry.\r\n\r\nBut Dick demurred and at last it was decided to try getting to the\r\nhouse by journeying from one island to the next.\r\n\r\nThis was a dangerous proceeding, as we already know. They had to\r\nbuild themselves a small raft and carry this from one crossing to\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nBy the time the last crossing was made the storm was clearing and\r\nthe day was drawing to a close.\r\n\r\n\"We had best not show ourselves until we are sure how the land lays,\"\r\nsaid Dick, as they came up the beach.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jerry thought this good advice and they proceeded with caution\r\nuntil they came in sight of the house. Then Dick set up a shout.\r\n\r\n\"Tom, Sam, and Captain Blossom are back! Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\n\"They look as if they were having a row with Baxter and the mate,\"\r\ncame from old Jerry.\r\n\r\nA row certainly was in progress, and as they came closer they heard\r\nTom talking.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Lesher, I want to know all about this quarrel with my brother\r\nDick. I am sure he was not in the wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, I know my own business,\" the mate growled. \"You shut up\r\nand leave me alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't leave you alone,\" came from Sam. \"We want to know the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, tell us the truth, Lesher,\" said Captain Blossom sternly.\r\n\r\n\"All against me, aint you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We want the truth,\" answered Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you must have it, all right. He got cheeky and hit me on\r\nthe head with an oar. Then I hit back and knocked him down. Then he\r\ngot mad and so did Jerry Tolman, and both refused to come back in\r\nthe boat with Baxter and me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll wager you started to boss things,\" said Sam. \"Dick doesn't\r\nraise a row without just cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for Sam,\" murmured Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Your brother was entirely to blame,\" grunted the mate. He was still\r\nfar from sober.\r\n\r\n\"Jack Lesher, you tell what is not so,\" said Dick loudly, and joined\r\nthe group, followed by old Jerry.\r\n\r\nHad a bombshell exploded, Lesher and Baxter would not have been more\r\nastonished. Then stared at the newcomers as if they were ghosts.\r\n\r\n\"How--er--how did you get here?\" stammered Baxter, while the mate\r\ncontinued to stare, in open-mouthed astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"That is our affair,\" responded Dick. He strode up to Lesher. \"You\r\nmiserable villain. How dare you say that I was to blame when you\r\nattacked me without warning? Take that for what you did.\"\r\n\r\nAnd hauling off, Dick hit the mate a fair and square blow in the nose\r\nwhich sent Lesher flat on his back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTRYING TO COME TO TERMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the mate went down the girls gave a scream, and even Tom and Sam\r\nlooked at Dick in wonder. Never had any of them seen the eldest Rover\r\nso aroused.\r\n\r\n\"My lad, that was a hard blow,\" observed Captain Blossom, as Jack\r\nLesher lay where he had fallen.\r\n\r\n\"Not half as hard as the blow he struck me,\" answered Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Not hard as hard as thet chap hit me,\" put in old Jerry, and turning\r\nquickly he flew at Dan Baxter and bore him to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Hi! hi! let up!\" roared the bully. \"Let up! Take him off!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll let up, when I'm done,\" panted old Jerry, and he gave him a\r\nthump in the cheek, another in the eye, and a third on the chin.\r\n\"Now, then, Dan Baxter, see how you like that!\" And then the old\r\nsailor arose once more.\r\n\r\n\"I'll--I'll--\" began Baxter, in a terrible rage. \"I'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, Baxter, until we hear what they have to say,\" put in Tom.\r\n\"If you are not quiet, I'll give you a thumping on general principles.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more fighting,\" commanded Captain Blossom. \"Dick Rover, tell us\r\nwhat happened on the wreck.\"\r\n\r\nDick told his story, and then all listened to what old Jerry had to\r\nsay. In the meantime Jack Lesher arose unsteadily to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Where is that boy?\" he roared. \"I'll fix him.\" And then he made a\r\nmovement as if to draw his pistol, but discovered that the weapon\r\nhad been taken from him.\r\n\r\n\"Who took my pistol?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, everybody,\" said Captain Blossom. \"Lesher, there will be\r\nno shootng here, unless I have to make an example of somebody. You\r\nhad no business to attack Dick Rover on the wreck, nor attack Jerry\r\nTolman, either. It was a mean thing to do. If we are to remain on\r\nthese islands together, we ought to keep friendly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know my business,\" growled the mate.\r\n\r\n\"And I know mine, Lesher. Please remember that I am captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am first mate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your being first mate doesn't count with us,\" came from Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Not for a minute,\" added Dick. \"If I had my own way, I'd pitch you\r\nout of this camp in double-quick order.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Dan Baxter with him,\" put in Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Why cannot both of them go and live with the other sailors who were\r\nsaved?\" asked Dora. \"They could have their share of what is on the\r\nwreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see you don't care for their company,\" said Captain Blossom. \"Well,\r\nI can't say that I blame you, miss. After this they shall keep their\r\ndistance. They can either live on the wreck or build themselves their\r\nown house, and so can the other sailors who were saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not my master!\" cried Dan Baxter. \"On these islands all are\r\nequal.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be so, but you have got to let the others alone,\" answered\r\nDick. \"If you don't--\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll punish you in a way you least expect.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this there was a general talk which almost ended in another\r\nall-around row. But the Rovers and Captain Blossom were firm, and at\r\nlast Dan Baxter and Jack Lesher said no more.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to remain on guard after this,\" said Dick to Tom, when they\r\nand Sam were alone. \"I don't want to trust our enemies for a single\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was agreed that one or another should watch constantly.\r\n\r\nThe storm cleared away as suddenly as it had come, and the next\r\nmorning the sun shone as brightly as ever.\r\n\r\nWhen Baxter and Lesher came to breakfast both were sullen. The mate\r\nhad wanted more liquor, but Captain Blossom had refused to give him\r\nmore than a single glass.\r\n\r\n\"You had better return to the others at once,\" said the captain.\r\n\"Tell them they can come over here, and then we will make arrangements\r\nas to how all hands shall live until some ship comes to take us away.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rovers suspected that Dan Baxter wished to remain behind, leaving\r\nthe mate to go after the others. But Lesher would not go alone, and\r\noff they started at noon, each carrying a good supply of food with\r\nhim, and also a pistol and some ammunition.\r\n\r\n\"I wish they weren't coming back,\" murmured Dora.\r\n\r\n\"I wish the same, Dora,\" said Dick. \"But it can't be helped and we\r\nmust make the best of it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a general air of relief when the two had departed. Later\r\non each told his or her story once more, and a general conversation\r\nensued regarding the future.\r\n\r\n\"Lesher is not the man I thought he would, be,\" said Captain Blossom.\r\n\"If he insists on getting drunk he will surely cause us a good deal\r\nof trouble, and if I try to keep the liquor from him he will get\r\nugly. More than that, he has several sailors with him who are old\r\nfriends, and they like their liquor just as much as he does.\"\r\n\r\nIt was seen that the flag of distress was down, as already mentioned,\r\nand after Baxter and Lesher had departed, Tom and Dick set off to\r\nput the flag up once more.\r\n\r\nThe way was by no means easy, for the storm had washed the dirt and\r\nstones in all directions and the path was strewn with broken branches\r\nand torn-up bushes. On the way they picked up hard a dozen dead birds\r\nand also saw three dead monkeys.\r\n\r\nWhen the spot where the flag had been was reached they found the tree\r\nstill standing. The halyard of the flag had snapped and the colors\r\nlay in a mass of bushes a hundred feet away.\r\n\r\nTo get to the bushes the boys had to leap over something of a gully.\r\nTom took the leap in safety, but Sam went down out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"Help! help!\" cried the youngest Rover.\r\n\r\nTom looked back, to see Sam's fingers clutching at some brushwood\r\nwhich grew at the edge of the gully. Then the hand disappeared and\r\nhe heard a crashing far below, for though the gully was not wide, it\r\nwas very deep.\r\n\r\n\"Sam! Sam!\" he called. \"Are you hurt?\"\r\n\r\nNo answer came back, and much alarmed, Tom got on his knees and tried\r\nto look into the opening. At first he could see nothing, but when\r\nhis eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, he made out the form of\r\nhis brother lying on some broken brushwood which the storm had swept\r\ninto the opening.\r\n\r\nHow to get down to Sam was a problem, and Tom was revolving the matter\r\nin his mind when Sam let out another cry.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt, Sam?\"\r\n\r\n\"N--not much, but m--my wind was kno--knocked out of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you climb up to the top?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly, Tom, the sides are very steep, and--yes, there is a regular\r\ncave down here,\" went on Sam.\r\n\r\n\"A cave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does it lead to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. It's on the south side of the opening.\"\r\n\r\nTom's curiosity was aroused, and bringing forth the new rope they\r\nhad brought along for hoisting the flag, he tied one end to a tree\r\nand lowered himself to his brother's side. By this time Sam was on\r\nhis feet and inspecting some scratches his left hand had received.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the cave, Sam?\"\r\n\r\n\"There,\" and the youngest Rover pointed it out.\r\n\r\nThe opening was about two feet above the bottom of the gully. It was\r\nperhaps four feet in diameter, but appeared to grow larger within.\r\n\r\n\"If we had a torch we might investigate a bit,\" said Tom. \"I'd like\r\nto know if the cave amounts to anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might have a pirate's treasure in it, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not likely, Sam. I don't believe it has ever been used. But if it\r\nwas of good size it might prove handy for us at some time or another.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked around, and finding some dry brushwood made two rude\r\ntorches. With these flaring brightly they entered the opening, the\r\nflooring of which was of rock and tolerably smooth.\r\n\r\n\"We could live in this cave, if it wasn't that the opening to it is\r\nin the gully,\" said Sam as they advanced.\r\n\r\n\"There may be another opening at the other end,\" said Tom. \"It is\r\ncertainly quite long.\"\r\n\r\nThey had advanced fully a hundred feet, and now found themselves in\r\na chamber forty or fifty feet square. The ceiling was arched and so\r\nhigh that they could not touch it without jumping up.\r\n\r\n\"This is as good as a house,\" said Tom. \"See how dry the flooring\r\nis. That proves that it is waterproof.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the large chamber there were several passageways, all leading\r\ntoward the bay.\r\n\r\n\"Which shall we investigate first?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Let us start at the right.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Tom; the right ought to be right,\" answered Sam lightly.\r\n\r\nOn they went once more, the flooring now sloping before them. Here\r\nthere was considerable moisture, and they had to walk with care for\r\nfear of slipping down.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a number of bats flew out of a hole nearby, dashing against\r\nthe torches and against the boys themselves. The rush was so unexpected\r\nthat each youth dropped his light and put up his hands to protect\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Get out! Let me alone!\" spluttered Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Whoop!\" roared Tom. \"Confound the bats anyway! Get along and let us\r\nalone!\"\r\n\r\nLying on the flooring the torches soon went out, and in their efforts\r\nto protect themselves from the bats the boys rushed blindly down the\r\npassageway. Then of a sudden both slipped on the wet rocks, slid a\r\ndistance of several yards, and went down and down, landing into a\r\nwell-like opening with a loud splash!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE CAVE ON THE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Tom!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I wasn't looking for such a cold bath as this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess we must have fallen into a regular well of spring water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind what we are in. The question is, how are we to get out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you touch the top of the opening?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither can I.\"\r\n\r\nLuckily the two boys could touch the bottom of the hole, so they were\r\nin no danger of drowning. They were in water up to their waists and\r\ncalculated they had dropped a distance of two or three yards. All\r\nwas pitch dark around them and as silent as a tomb, save for some\r\nwater which trickled close at hand. The bats had departed, leaving\r\nthem to their fate.\r\n\r\n\"This is cave-investigating with a vengeance,\" said Tom, with something\r\nlike a shiver.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Tom, we won't die of thirst anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think this is a laughing matter, Sam?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't. I'd give a good deal to be out of this hole and out of\r\nthe cave also.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got an idea. Let me climb on your shoulders and see if I can\r\nreach the top that way.\"\r\n\r\nSam was willing, and soon Tom was balancing himself as best he could.\r\nHe felt around with care, Sam moving from point to point as directed.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a sharp rock; I think I can pull myself up on that,\" said\r\nTom. He tried with all of his strength and went up off Sam's shoulders.\r\nThen the youngest Rover heard him crawling around the wet flooring\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom felt fairly safe he brought out his waterproof match safe\r\nand lit a match. Then one of the torches was picked up and he lit\r\nthat, but kept it partly sheltered, fearing another attack from the\r\nbats.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the torch, Sam was able to reach a sharp rock quite\r\nlow down in the well hole, and when Tom gave him a hand he came up\r\nwith ease. Both saw that the passage ended at the hole and hurried\r\nback to the main chamber of the cave.\r\n\r\n\"That's the time that right was not right,\" said Sam, wringing the\r\nwater from his trousers, while Tom did the same. \"Let us try the left\r\nafter this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust we don't get left by it,\" added Sam.\r\n\r\nThe passageway was small and winding, but fairly level. There were\r\nseveral sharp rocks to pass and then Tom gave a cry.\r\n\r\n\"I see a light ahead!\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be an opening, Tam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly what I think.\"\r\n\r\nBoth hurried forward. As they did this, the opening appeared to grow\r\nlarger and they saw a number of bushes ahead of them. They pushed\r\nthese aside and saw beyond a clear stretch of the bay and to the\r\nnorthward the house they had built. The opening was twenty or thirty\r\nfeet above the beach and hidden in the rocks and bushes.\r\n\r\n\"This is a short cut to the beach from the flagstaff,\" said Sam. \"I\r\nwish we had put up the flag. Then we could carry the news of the cave\r\nto the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us hurry back, Sam. It won't take so very long to put up the\r\nflag, with the tree still standing.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the gully they were careful that no further mishaps\r\nshould befall them. Having picked up the flag they hoisted it once\r\nmore, stars down, and then went back through the cave to the beach.\r\n\r\nAs they had imagined, the others were greatly interested in the news.\r\nAll left the house and visited the place. The girls did not go any\r\nfurther than the main chamber, but the captain, Dick, and old Jerry\r\nmade a complete investigation, taking care not to fall into the\r\nwell-hole or any other unsafe place.\r\n\r\n\"As the boys say, this cave may come in very handy some time,\" said\r\nCaptain Blossom. \"In case of a very heavy wind storm it would be a\r\ngood place for shelter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why couldn't the sailors, Lesher, and Baxter live here?\" asked Dick.\r\n\"We don't want them, and it will save them the trouble of building\r\na house, in case they don't want to live on the wreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I advise that we tell them nothing about the cave,\" said Tom.\r\n\"If we should have a fight and get the worst of it, we could hide\r\nhere and they wouldn't be able to find us very readily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it will get as far as that?\" asked Dora, and her face\r\nshowed she was much disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"I hope not, Dora,\" said Dick. \"But you must remember that we have\r\nhad some pretty sharp quarrels already.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Tom is right,\" came from Sam. \"We'll not tell the others\r\nanything about the cave. If they don't want to live on the wreck,\r\nthey can build a house or two, just as we did.\"\r\n\r\nOn returning to the shore of the bay, Captain Blossom and Tom went\r\non a hunt along the beach and presently discovered the rowboat that\r\nhad overturned with them during the storm.\r\n\r\nThe craft was but little damaged and they soon had it mended, and\r\nthen the captain brought it around to the anchorage in front of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder when Baxter and Lesher will arrive with the sailors?\" said\r\nNellie.\r\n\r\n\"Not before to-morrow night,\" answered Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Then do you know what I would do if I were you?\" went on the girl.\r\n\r\n\"What, Nellie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd bring some stores away from the wreck and hide them in the cave.\r\nIf you did that, it might save us a good deal of trouble. For all we\r\nknow, that mate might try to take command and refuse to let us get\r\nanything more from the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think he'd do that while Captain Blossom was around?\" came\r\nfrom Grace.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he might do anything when he is half full of liquor,\" answered\r\nTom. \"I think Nellie is right. I'll talk it over with the others.\"\r\n\r\nTom lost no time in the matter, and Dick, Sam, and old Jerry agreed\r\nthat Nellie's idea was very good. Captain Blossom shrugged his\r\nshoulders and looked ugly.\r\n\r\n\"Jack Lesher shall not take the command from me,\" he said. \"If he\r\ntries it, he'll find himself in the biggest kind of a row.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must admit that there is grave danger,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I admit that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are willing that we shall hide the stores?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't you help us, Captain Blossom? Of course, we recognize the fact\r\nthat those things belong to you, since you remained on the ship up\r\nto the time she struck the island.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech pleased the captain, and he said he would help them\r\nwillingly.\r\n\r\nWithout delay the two rowboats and the raft were called into commission,\r\nand an hour later the men and boys were hard at work transferring\r\ngoods from the wreck to the beach in front of the cave. Five trips\r\nwere made back and forth, the boats and the raft bringing over each,\r\ntime as much as could be conveniently floated.\r\n\r\nBy the time the last trip was made and the goods piled on the beach\r\nand covered with a large tarpaulin, it was dark and all were utterly\r\nworn out by their labors. The girls had prepared an extra good\r\nsupper, and of this they ate heartily and then sat around a little\r\nwhile, when they went to bed.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning the castaways had kept guard during the night, but\r\nof late this had been done away with, everybody being satisfied that\r\nno harm could befall them during the darkness.\r\n\r\nBut as the doorway to the house was an open one it had been considered\r\nthe duty of one or the other to sleep directly in the opening. This\r\nwas Dick's night, and the eldest Rover lay there sleeping soundly\r\nuntil about two in the morning.\r\n\r\nBy this time the moon had disappeared and the stars were partly hidden\r\nby some clouds. The night was quiet, save for the hum of insects in\r\nthe jungle back of the house and the soft lap-lap of the waves on\r\nthe beach of the bay.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Dick awoke with a start. He sat bolt upright, wondering what\r\nhad brought him to his senses so quickly. He listened intently, but\r\nnothing unusual greeted his ears.\r\n\r\n\"I must have been dreaming, or something,\" he thought. \"But is queer\r\nI should be so wide.. awake.\"\r\n\r\nAt first he was on the point of lying down again, but then concluded\r\nto get up and get a drink of water.\r\n\r\nHe arose to his feet and stood in the open doorway, gazing into the\r\ndarkness. The faint light of a few stars shone in the waters of the\r\nbay, and between the waters and himself he presently saw a dark form\r\nstealing along, close to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhat could that be? Was it something real or only a shadow? Dick\r\nrubbed his eyes and peered out more sharply than ever. It was not a\r\nshadow, but a real form, slowly moving around to the rear of the house.\r\n\r\n\"An animal, or else a man crawling along,\" said Dick to himself, and\r\nreached for his gun, which stood close at hand. Then he made up his\r\nmind to investigate, and stepped outside of the doorway for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nA FIGHT WITH A WILD BEAST\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Dick stepped out of the house, gun in hand, the form disappeared\r\nbehind a small clump of bushes growing not fifty feet away.\r\n\r\n\"It's gone,\" he said to himself, but waited patiently, with his gun\r\nready for use.\r\n\r\nThe clouds were increasing, making it darker than ever. Almost holding\r\nhis breath, the youth took several steps forward. Then he waited again.\r\n\r\nAt last the form reappeared, crouched lower than ever, so that it\r\nwas almost hidden by the rocks and low brushwood leading to the\r\njungle. At first Dick imagined the beast, or whatever it was, was\r\ngoing to retreat to the timber, but soon it appeared to turn back,\r\nas if to make another semicircle, this time around to the rear of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that Dick's heart thumped madly in his breast.\r\nThe gun was raised and he kept his finger on the trigger. But he did\r\nnot dare to shoot until he was certain of the object of his aim.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to kill anybody,\" he reasoned. And he thought of a\r\nstory he had once read of a hunter shooting his companion who had\r\ngot the nightmare and was crawling around in his sleep. For all he\r\nknew, it might be Sam or Tom, or one of the others.\r\n\r\nBut now came a sound which was not to be mistaken. It was a low,\r\nsavage growl, followed by the rustling of a bushy tail among the\r\nbrushwood. It was a wild animal, and it was getting ready to make\r\na leap for the boy!\r\n\r\nTaking aim as best he could, Dick pulled the trigger. Bang! went the\r\nfirearm, and a snarl of pain and rage rang out. Then the beast made\r\nits leap, striking Dick in the breast and knocking him over.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo! what's the row?\" The cry came from old Jerry, who had been\r\nsleeping next to Dick. \"Who fired that shot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Help!\" answered Dick. \"A wild beast has attacked me.\"\r\n\r\n\"A wild beast!\" came from several throats at once.\r\n\r\n\"Let me get a shot,\" came from Tom, as he bounced out of the house,\r\npistol in hand, followed by Sam and Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\nBy this time Dick had gotten to his knees and was trying to fight\r\noff the animal which had fastened its teeth in the youth's trouser\r\nleg, for the boys slept with part of their garments on them.\r\n\r\n\"Shoot him! Hit him over the head with a club!\" screamed the eldest\r\nRover. He expected every moment to have the beast fly at his throat,\r\nand he knew that that would be his death.\r\n\r\nOld Jerry turned back to get a pistol or a club. As he did this Tom\r\nrushed past him and up to Dick's side. Taking a hasty aim, Tom\r\ndischarged the pistol twice.\r\n\r\nAnother growl rang out and the beast dropped back, shot through the\r\nforeshoulder and the neck. Then Tom let drive once more and the beast\r\nfell forward, shot through the left front leg.\r\n\r\n\"Good for you, Tom!\" cried Dick, as he arose.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" came from Captain Blossom, as he appeared with a shotgun.\r\nA shot from this finished the beast and it rolled over and over in\r\nits death agonies, and Sam finished it with a blow on the head with\r\na big club.\r\n\r\nBy this time the girls were crowding outside, having clothed themselves\r\nwith whatever was handiest. Torches were lit, and a ship's lantern,\r\nand all went to examine the creature.\r\n\r\n\"It looks like a tiger,\" declared Tom. \"Only it is not quite so large.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say it was a California puma,\" came from old Jerry. \"He's\r\na bad one, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they call them jaguars out here,\" said Dick. \"They all belong\r\nto the same family, you know. Some old American hunters would call\r\nit a painter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind what it is,\" said Dora, with a shudder. \"I am thankful\r\nthat it is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can be thankful that it didn't chew Dick up,\" added Tom. \"He\r\nwas in a tight corner, I can tell you that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want to shoot until I was certain of what I was shooting\r\nat,\" answered Dick. \"Then, just as I fired, the beast leaped for me.\r\nIf I hadn't wounded it, it would have had me by the throat sure. But\r\nmy shot kind of made it fall back, and it caught me by the trouser leg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you are not hurt, lad?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Not hurt in the least,\" answered Dick, and all were thankful that\r\nthis was so.\r\n\r\nThe animal was dragged close to the cabin. It measured about five\r\nfeet in length, regardless of the tail, and was of a dull yellowish\r\ncolor. Its teeth were long and sharp, and its face had a fierce,\r\nblood-thirsty look about it that made all the girls shiver.\r\n\r\n\"I must confess that I am surprised to find such a beast on these\r\nislands,\" said Captain Blossom. \"Usually they are to be found only\r\non the mainland or on large islands.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I am wondering is, are there any more around?\" came from Sam.\r\n\r\n\"If there are, we'll have to be careful how we move around,\" put in\r\nold Jerry. \"I don't want any of 'em to leap out at me from behind a\r\nrock.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to be on the watch,\" said Tom. \"I'm sure I don't want to\r\nfurnish any tropical tiger cat with a square meal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom, how awful to even mention it!\" cried Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"I think I know a way to keep 'em away from the house at night,\" said\r\nold Jerry.\r\n\r\n\"How?\" questioned several.\r\n\r\n\"Keep a camp-fire burning close to the door. All wild animals hate\r\na fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jerry is right,\" said Captain Blossom. \"We'll do it after this.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do with the beast?\" asked Dick. \"I don't think it is\r\ngood to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Save the skin,\" said Dora. \"That will surely make an elegant rug.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave the carcass until morning,\" said Captain Blossom. \"We must\r\nget some more sleep if we want to go to work to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day, you mean,\" said Tom, looking at his watch. \"It is already\r\nthree o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nA camp-fire was lit and then all but Jerry retired, it being agreed\r\nthat the old sailor was to turn in once more when the others arose\r\nfor breakfast. All but Dick slept soundly, but even the eldest Rover\r\nwas benefited by the additional rest.\r\n\r\nThe first work in the morning was to skin the wild beast. This was\r\nrather a difficult task since no one had had any experience, outside\r\nof the Rover boys, on small game. Old Jerry said he would try a steak\r\ncut from the best part of the the animal, but when he did he said it\r\nwas too tough to eat. Then the carcass was dragged away and flung\r\ninto a hole between the rocks.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, the men and boys began in earnest to place the stores\r\nbrought to the beach in the cave. It was hard work getting the boxes\r\nand barrels up the incline to the mouth of the cave, and the work\r\ntook until the middle of the afternoon. Once at the entrance, the\r\nstores were speedily shifted to the chamber previously mentioned,\r\nand covered again with the tarpaulin. With the stores were placed a\r\ncask of fresh water, some dry pine torches and a box of matches.\r\nCaptain Blossom left a gun and some ammunition in the cave, and the\r\nRover boys added two pistols and a couple of swords taken from the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Now we will re-arrange the entrance to the cave as it was before,\"\r\nsaid Dick. \"Then the sailors will never suspect what we have done.\"\r\n\r\nBy sunset the work was over and all hands were back at the house,\r\ntaking it easy. Supper was ready, but they waited hard an hour,\r\nthinking that Baxter, Lesher, and their party would put in an appearance\r\nat any moment.\r\n\r\n\"I reckon they aren't coming just yet,\" said Captain Blossom, at\r\nlength. \"Let us wait no longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm willing,\" said Tom. The extra work had sharpened his appetite\r\nwonderfully.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed quietly and soon one after another retired. As\r\nagreed, the camp-fire was left burning, and each took his turn at\r\nremaining on guard.\r\n\r\nIn the morning it was Dora who made an announcement that startled\r\nall of them. The girl had taken Captain Blossom's spyglass and was\r\nlooking across the bay in the direction of the wreck.\r\n\r\n\"There are men on board of the _Golden Wave_\" she announced. \"I can\r\nsee them quite plainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men on board of the wreck!\" cried Dick. \"Are you sure, Dora?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look for yourself, Dick.\"\r\n\r\nThe youth did so and saw that Dora was right. Half a dozen figures\r\ncould be seen walking to and fro.\r\n\r\n\"Who are they?\" asked Tom. \"Lesher and his crowd?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I can't make out,\" answered Dick, and handed over the glass to\r\nhis brother.\r\n\r\nAll could see the men on the wreck, but at such a distance it was\r\nimpossible to make out any faces.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they are savages,\" came from Grace.\r\n\r\n\"No, they are dressed like white people,\" said Captain Blossom..\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps another ship has come in!\" ejaculated Tom. \"If it has, we\r\nare saved!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see any other ship,\" said old Jerry.\r\n\r\n\"It may be on the other side of yonder island,\" came from Sam.\r\n\r\n\"The best thing we can do is to row over and investigate,\" said\r\nCaptain Blossom. \"If another ship has come in, the captain may claim\r\nthat wreck and everything on board.\"\r\n\r\nA hasty breakfast was prepared and eaten, and it was agreed that the\r\ncaptain, Dick, and old Jerry should row over to the wreck in the best\r\nof the boats. The three were soon on the way, wondering whom they\r\nwere to meet and what sort of a reception would be tendered to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE MATE SHOWS HIS HAND\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Blossom had taken the spyglass along, and as they drew closer\r\nto the wreck he gazed long and earnestly at the men walking the deck\r\nof the _Golden Wave_.\r\n\r\n\"They are my crew,\" he announced at last. \"And they are in tatters.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must have had a hard time of it since you were cast ashore,\"\r\nsaid Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Unless I am mistaken, not a one of them is sober,\" went on the\r\ncaptain. \"They are cutting up like a band of wild Indians.\"\r\n\r\nBefore long they were within hailing distance of those on the wreck.\r\nThen a voice from the rail hailed them.\r\n\r\n\"Boat ahoy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ahoy!\" answered the captain.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" demanded the sailor on the wreck. He could scarcely\r\ntalk straight.\r\n\r\n\"We want to come on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, cap'n, but I can't let you come aboard,\" answered the sailor,\r\nwith something of a hiccough.\r\n\r\n\"Can't let me come aboard?\" repeated the captain. \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cause it's ag'in orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Lesher's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Lesher!\" ejaculated Captain Blossom indignantly. \"How long\r\nhas he been a captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"We made him cap'n yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" put in another sailor. \"We 'lected him unan--nan--\r\nnan'mously; yes, sir, unan--nan--nan'mously.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are drunk, Bostwick.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, aint drunk at all.--Lesher, he's drunk--but he's cap'n\r\nall the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" put in a third sailor. \"Hurrah for Captain Lesher\r\nand the rum he let us have!\"\r\n\r\n\"Got to keep off, I tell you,\" went on Bostwick. \"If you don't, we\r\nhave--er--we have strict orders to fire on you, yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"To fire on us!\" cried Dick.--\"Do you mean to say you would fire on us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, see here, don't you put in your oar,\" said a fourth sailor.\r\n\"You don't count with us. It's the cap'n that was we're talkin' to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am captain still,\" said Captain Blossom firmly. \"If you don't want\r\nto obey me, you must leave the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aint going to leave no ship!\" was the cry. \"She belongs to us. You\r\nkeep off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, keep off!\" added the others on the deck.\r\n\r\n\"The ship is mine,\" said the captain. \"If you refuse to let me come\r\non board--\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment two other figures appeared on deck.\r\n\r\n\"Dan Baxter and Jack Lesher!\" murmured Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Blossom, you had better keep your distance,\" said Lesher in\r\na voice that showed he was just getting over a spell of drunkenness.\r\n\r\n\"So you too refuse to let me come on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. The boys have made me their captain, and as such I am bound\r\nto look after their interests. I have told them what you proposed to\r\ndo, and they don't intend to stand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I tell you we'd get square?\" put in Dan Baxter, his evil face\r\nglowing with triumph. \"We have all that is on board, and we mean to\r\nkeep everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is mutiny!\" stormed Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\n\"Call it what you please,\" answered Lesher recklessly. \"I reckon I\r\nand the boys know what we are doing!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right!\" cried the half-drunken sailors. \"Hurrah for Cap'n\r\nLesher. He's a man after our own hearts!\"\r\n\r\n\"Supposing I demand to be let on board?\" went on Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\n\"Don't ye go, cap'n,\" whispered old Jerry. \"They are in jest a fit\r\nmood to kill ye. The rum has put the Old Nick in 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't come on board, and that settles it,\" roared Jack Lesher,\r\ndrawing a pistol. \"Keep your distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, keep your distance,\" added Baxter, and also showed a firearm.\r\n\r\n\"This is a fine way to treat us, after what we did for you,\" said\r\nDick. \"But, wait, Baxter, the end is not yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! I am not afraid,\" said the bully. \"These men are all my friends,\r\nand we know exactly what we are doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you expect to remain on the wreck?\" asked the captain, after a\r\nmoment of silence.\r\n\r\n\"That is our business,\" answered Lesher.\r\n\r\n\"I think you will find that you are making a great mistake, men, to\r\nfollow Lesher when you ought to follow me. I have always treated you\r\nfairly, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hi! none of that!\" roared the mate. \"We won't listen to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The men shall listen, if they will. I\r\n\r\n\"Say another word and I'll fire!\" cried the mate, and pointed his\r\npistol at Captain Blossom's head.\r\n\r\n\"Do-do you mean that?\" asked the captain, in as steady a voice as he\r\ncould command.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he means it,\" said Dan Baxter. \"He isn't a fool. We are\r\nall going to stand by him, too,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" came from part of the crew. Dick noticed that a few\r\nof the others looked doubtful.\r\n\r\n\"I mean it, and I want you to leave right now,\" stormed Jack Lesher.\r\n\"I'll give you one minute in which to turn your boat around,\" and he\r\npulled out his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Might as well go back,\" whispered old Jerry. \"You can't reason with\r\na lot of half-drunken men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, we'll go back,\" said Captain Blossom loudly. \"But,\r\nremember, you haven't seen the end of this affair.\"\r\n\r\n\"And remember another thing,\" added Dick, in an equally loud voice:\r\n\"Don't any of you dare to come anywhere near our house. If you do,\r\nyou'll be sorry for it.\"\r\n\r\nThen the three turned the boat around and rowed slowly back whence\r\nthey had come.\r\n\r\n\"The rascals!\" muttered Captain Blossom, when they were out of hearing.\r\n\"Lesher and Baxter have poisoned the minds of the crew against me,\r\nand have bought over the men with liquor.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a mighty good thing ye put them stores in the cave,\" came from\r\nold Jerry. \"If ye hadn't we'd be a-wantin' a good many things in a\r\nfew days.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" answered Dick. \"Dora told me they must have another\r\nbarrel of flour by day after to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many at the cave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it certainly was a good job done,\" said the captain. \"But it\r\nmakes me boil to think they want to keep me off my own ship. On the\r\nocean that would be mutiny, and I could hang every mother's son of\r\nthem from the yardarm for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lesher must have told 'em some putty strong stories,\" said old Jerry.\r\n\"Otherwise the men wouldn't be so dead set ag'in ye, cap'n.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt he made out the strongest possible case.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if they will stick to the wreck all the time,\" said Dick.\r\n\"They'll find it mighty hot when the sun shines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they'll most likely take some of the things ashore, and set up\r\na camp nearby, Rover.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to watch them closely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you. Now we have two kinds of enemies--beasts and men,\"\r\nand the captain laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\nThe others were gathered on the shore awaiting their return, and they\r\nlistened attentively to what was told them.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Lesher wanted to be leader, you could see that right off,\"\r\ndeclared Tom. \"And Baxter will do anything to make it disagreeable\r\nfor us boys,\" he continued.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is one satisfaction,\" said Nellie. \"We haven't Baxter\r\nwith us.\"\r\n\r\n\"If only a ship would stop here and take us away!\" sighed Dora. To\r\nher it seemed like an age since they had landed on the seven islands.\r\n\r\n\"After this we must keep a regular guard,\" announced Dick. \"Unless\r\nwe do that, somebody may play us foul when we least expect it.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly the day wore away. By the aid of the spyglass they could see\r\nthe sailors still on the deck of the wreck. Nobody appeared to go ashore.\r\n\r\nThat night it fell to Sam's lot to be on guard from nine to ten\r\no'clock. The camp-fire was left burning brightly, and the youngest\r\nRover sat near it on a log, a gun in his lap.\r\n\r\n\"No wild beast shall surprise me,\" he told himself, and kept his eyes\r\non the jungle back of the house.\r\n\r\nHis time for guard duty had almost come to an end when a noise down\r\non the beach attracted his attention. By the faint light he made out\r\na raft, which had just come in, bearing the figures of two sailors.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" he called out. \"Do not come closer at your peril!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't shoot!\" called back one of the sailors. \"Don't shoot! We mean\r\nno harm.\"\r\n\r\nSam had backed up toward the house, and now he called to those within.\r\nHe was soon joined by Captain Blossom, Dick, and several of the others.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" asked the captain, as he came forth, pistol in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Two of the sailors from the wreck, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't shoot us, captain,\" called one of the men. \"We are unarmed\r\nand want to talk with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are Gibson and Marny,\" said Captain Blossom. \"They were generally\r\npretty good sort of fellows. I reckon we have nothing to fear from them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you alone?\" called out Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then come up to the fire. But mind, no treachery.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't wonder at your being on guard,\" said the sailor named\r\nGibson, a tall, thin Yankee. \"The others treated you like so many dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have deserted Lesher,\" put in Marny. \"We came over here on the\r\nraft to see if you wouldn't take us in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you alone?\" asked Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\n\"No, we had Hackenhaven with us. But he fell overboard just after we\r\nleft the wreck, and the sharks caught him,\" answered Gibson, with a\r\nbitter shake of his face.\r\n\r\n\"What did Lesher say to your leaving?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't know it until after we were a hundred yards or more from\r\nthe wreck. You see, he and the others were drinking in the cabin, so\r\nwe got away without much trouble,\" answered Marny. \"They might have\r\nshot at us, but it was too dark for them. We had a hard pull to get\r\nover here, and when poor Hackenhaven was gobbled up both of us felt\r\nbad, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now seen that both sailors were almost exhausted, and Captain\r\nBlossom allowed them to rest, while Dick prepared a pot of coffee.\r\nWhile they were drinking, Gibson told them the particulars of how\r\nthe mate had made himself leader of the sailors now left on the wreck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE BURNING OF THE WRECK\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When Lesher and Baxter got back to where they left us they were very\r\nbitter against you,\" began Gibson. \"They told us that you had tried\r\nto make them work like niggers, fixing up this house. They said that\r\nthey wanted to come right back and bring us here, but you wouldn't\r\nlet them go until the house was finished.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is not true, as all of us here know,\" said Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\n\"Lesher also said that you were angry at us for leaving the ship\r\nbefore the rest, and that you had said you would have us all tried\r\nfor mutiny the first chance you got. Baxter said the same, and also\r\ntold us that you were going to dump all the rum and other liquor into\r\nthe ocean, so that the mate and none of the others could get a drop\r\nof it while they stayed on the islands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say that, but I did say that Lesher Shouldn't have all he\r\nwanted,\" replied the captain.\r\n\r\n\"This sort of talk made most of the sailors wild,\" went on Gibson.\r\n\"Then Lesher made a speech to them, and they voted to stick by him\r\nthrough thick and thin and not let you rule them. He promised them\r\nall the liquor they wanted, and told them that if they stuck by him\r\nthe whole lot could swear in court that they had found the wreck\r\ndeserted, so that they could get whatever was coming in the way of\r\nsalvage. Then he handed around some liquor he had brought along, and\r\nsome pistols, and most of them said they would stick to him, as I\r\nsaid before.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about going directly to the wreck?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"That was Baxter's idea, and it wasn't thought of until we were on\r\nour way to this spot. Baxter said that if we captured the ship we\r\nwould have you at our mercy, for sooner or later your provisions\r\nwould run out, and you'd be begging for something to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The scoundrel!\" cried Dick. \"So he thought to starve us into\r\nsubmission, eh? Well, he shan't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said I didn't think it would be fair on the young ladies,\" continued\r\nGibson. \"But he told me he'd take care of the girls after he had\r\nbrought you to your knees.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll never take care of me!\" cried Dora.\r\n\r\n\"Nor me!\" came from Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather die than leave this place in Dan Baxter's company,\" added\r\nGrace.\r\n\r\n\"Captain, I want you to understand that Gibson and I didn't agree\r\nto what they wanted to do,\" came from Marny. \"But we were overruled,\r\nand we had to hold our tongues for fear of being knocked down or shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to join our crowd?\" asked Dick bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"We do, and if you'll take us in we'll promise to stand by you to\r\nthe end, no matter what comes. We know they've got the best of\r\nit--having the ship's stores--but we don't care for that. They are\r\na drunken, good-for-nothing crowd, and we are done with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, men, I think we can trust you,\" said Captain Blossom.\r\n\"It's a pity that Hackenhaven was lost overboard and eat up by the\r\nsharks. We could rather have spared Lesher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or Dan Baxter,\" observed Tom.\r\n\r\n\"With three gone they have but eight men left on the wreck,\" said\r\nSam. \"And we now number seven men and three ladies. If we stand our\r\nground, I can't see as we have much to fear from them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be all right so long as they keep their distance,\" said\r\nCaptain Blossom. \"But if they come over here in a body when they are\r\nhalf full of drink, there is sure to be a row and probably some\r\nshooting. Still, we needn't try to meet trouble halfway.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailors gave some more of the details of their doings while in\r\nLesher's company, and then they were provided with additional clothing,\r\nand each was given a pistol and some ammunition. Nothing was said to\r\nthem about the cave or the provisions stored there, Captain Blossom\r\ndeeming it best to wait and make sure if they were to be thoroughly\r\ntrusted.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said he, \"they may be straight enough, or they may be\r\nspies sent by Lesher to find out just what we propose to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"They look honest,\" said Dick. \"I should trust them.\"\r\n\r\nThe long pull on the bay had worn the two sailors out, and they were\r\nsoon sleeping soundly. The girls followed, and then the boys started\r\nto turn in.\r\n\r\nSam had just gone to rest, and Tom was following, when Dick, who had\r\nstepped out on the beach, uttered a cry.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" asked Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\n\"Look toward the wreck. What does that light mean?\"\r\n\r\nThe captain looked, and then ran for his spy-glass.\r\n\r\n\"The _Golden Wave_ is afire!\" he exclaimed. \"That light is coming up\r\nout of the cabin!\"\r\n\r\n\"The wreck is on fire!\" shouted Tom, and this cry brought everybody\r\nout once more.\r\n\r\nWith remarkable rapidity the light grew brighter, until the heavens\r\nand the entire bay were lit up by the conflagration. There was a\r\nstrong wind blowing, which carried the sparks to the jungle back of\r\nthe ship. Listening intently, they could occasionally hear the roaring\r\nand crackling of the flames.\r\n\r\n\"The ship is doomed, that is certain,\" said Sam. \"I wonder if all\r\nwho were on board escaped?\"\r\n\r\n\"The fire has caught in the brushwood on the shore,\" announced Captain\r\nBlossom, who had continued to use the spyglass.\r\n\r\n\"Can you see any of the men moving around?\" questioned Dora.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I saw one or two, but I am not certain. Most of the men\r\nmust have escaped, but if they were drunk, as Gibson says, perhaps\r\nsome have been caught like rats in a trap.\"\r\n\r\nThe flames continued to roar upward, and toward the island back of\r\nthe ship, for over an hour. During that time they heard two dull\r\nexplosions, caused by some barrels of chemicals catching fire. The\r\nsecond explosion sent the bits of burning wood and rigging flying in\r\nall directions.\r\n\r\n\"That will leave the mutineers without a home and without stores,\"\r\nsaid old Jerry. \"They're in a poor fix now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know how the fire started,\" said the captain. \"Can you\r\nexplain it?\" he went on, to Gibson and Marny.\r\n\r\n\"I've got an idea,\" said Marny. \"Just before we came away old man\r\nShular went down in the hold with a light to look for some certain\r\nbrand of liquor we were carrying. He was more than half drunk, and\r\nhe most likely dropped his lantern and set something on fire.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour and a half the flames had died down to the\r\nwater's edge. A few small bits of wreckage continued to burn, and\r\nalso a grove of trees and brushwood on the island. But before morning\r\nevery bit of the fire was out, and only a heavy smoke showed where\r\nthe _Golden Wave_ had once rested.\r\n\r\nNo one had thought of retiring again, and sunrise found them all worn\r\nout, and anxious to know what was going to happen next.\r\n\r\n\"You can rest assured that some of them will be over here sooner or\r\nlater,\" said Dick. \"Now they have no place to shelter them, and no\r\nprovisions, they will want us to help them out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do, Dick?\" asked Dora.\r\n\r\n\"That depends on Captain Blossom, Dora. Personally I want nothing to\r\ndo with any of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But some may be badly burnt, and they may need medicine and bandages,\"\r\ncame from Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"We can send them whatever we can spare,\" said Tom. \"But I object\r\nstrongly to letting anybody come here.\"\r\n\r\nIt was decided to remain on guard during the day, and all were\r\ncautioned to keep within call of the house. The bay was scanned for\r\nthe sight of a rowboat, but none put in an appearance.\r\n\r\n\"I'll wager that those who did escape are sorry they quarreled with\r\nus,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Especially Dan Baxter,\" answered Grace. \"He'll find that living out\r\nin the woods isn't so pleasant as it looks.\"\r\n\r\nBy nightfall all grew anxious, and sat in front of the house to\r\ndiscuss the situation.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be possible that all on board were burnt up,\" said Dick.\r\n\"That would be horrible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, some must have escaped,\" answered Captain Blossom. \"But they\r\nmay be suffering from burns, or they may have no means of getting\r\nhere. With the ship burnt up, and all the tools gone, it would be no\r\neasy matter to build even the roughest kind of a raft.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think about some of us rowing over to what is left of\r\nthe wreck?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of that. But, if we do that, we had better wait until\r\nto-morrow morning. You can't see much in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I thought anybody was dying for the want of aid, I'd go over,\"\r\nsaid Tom. \"We all know what brutes Lesher and Baxter are. They wouldn't\r\nhesitate to go off and leave some of the others to die where they\r\nhad fallen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Tom is right, and some of us ought to go over,\" said Dick.\r\n\r\n\"I'm willing to go,\" announced old Jerry. \"We can move around like\r\ncats in the dark, so they won't know we are near until we tell 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might take some medicines along, and some bandages,\" said Nellie.\r\n\r\n\"Take a bottle of sweet oil and some flour,\" put in Grace. \"They are\r\nboth good for burns.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter was talked over until midnight, and then it was settled\r\nthat Dick, Tom, and old Jerry should take the largest rowboat and\r\nsome bandages and medicines and row over to the vicinity of the fire.\r\nThey were to land on the beach below what was left of the wreck and\r\ncrawl through the bushes on a tour of discovery. If they found that\r\nthey were not absolutely needed, they were to return without making\r\ntheir presence known to the mutineers and Dan Baxter.\r\n\r\nThe two boys and the old sailor were soon on the way. Care had been\r\ntaken to wrap cloth around the oars where they slipped in the row-locks,\r\nso that the boat moved through the water, as noiselessly as a shadow.\r\n\r\nOnce out in the bay the boys and old Jerry, pulled with a will, and\r\nin less than half an hour the beach north of what was left of the\r\nwreck was gained. They approached with great caution.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see or hear anything?\" whispered Tom.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Dick, and then the rowboat grated on the sand, and\r\nall leaped ashore.\r\n\r\nWith their medicines and bandages in their pockets, and pistols in\r\nhand, they commenced to crawl through the bushes. Before long they\r\ncame to a point from which they could look toward the wreck. All was\r\ndark and deserted and the air was filled with the smell of burnt\r\nwood and water.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see anybody, do you?\" whispered Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Nary a soul in sight,\" answered old Jerry.\r\n\r\nWith equal care they moved around to the other side of the wreck,\r\nover a mass of burnt brushwood.\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\" said Tom.\r\n\r\nThey listened, and, from a distance, made out a faint groan.\r\n\r\n\"That is somebody, and in great pain,\" said Dick. \"Come on,\" and he\r\nled the way.\r\n\r\nAround a pile of rocks they found a sailor. He was propped up against\r\na tree, and was suffering from some burns on his legs and feet.\r\n\r\n\"Bostwick!\" said old Jerry.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh! Help me!\" groaned Bostwick piteously. \"Give me a drink of\r\nwater!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are the others?\" asked Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Gone! They left me to take care of myself. Oh, the wretches! Please\r\nhelp me; won't you, for the love of Heaven!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we will help you,\" answered Tom.\r\n\r\n\"You are certain they have all gone?\" went on Dick, as he got out\r\nsome oil and bandages, while Tom ran for water.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did they go?\"\r\n\r\n\"They went--oh, my legs and feet! How they smart! They went to\r\nthe--the--house! Lesher said you must have set the ship on fire, and\r\nBaxter said the same. They--oh, what a pain! Please be careful!\"\r\nBostwick gulped down the water Tom gave him. \"That is good.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did they say, Bostwick?\" asked Dick, as he continued to work\r\nover the hurt man.\r\n\r\n\"They said they were going to pay you back. They all went armed; that\r\nis, all but me and Shular. Shular was burnt up. They said they were\r\ngoing to shoot you down on sight, and then run the house to suit\r\nthemselves. I said--oh, the pain. I--I--how weak I am!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with those words the burnt sailor fell back in a dead faint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE DEFENSE OF THE CAVE--SAVED!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He has fainted, poor fellow!\" said Dick, as he bent over the\r\nunconscious form of Bostwick.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to git back to the house at once!\" put in old Jerry. \"We\r\nmust warn the cap'n and the others of what Lesher and his crowd intend\r\nto do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, but we can't leave this poor chap here. He might die\r\nfor the want of care,\" came from Tom.\r\n\r\n\"We'll take him along,\" said Dick. \"Come, lift him up.\"\r\n\r\nAs carefully as they could they lifted the unconscious form up and\r\nbore it to where the rowboat was lying. Soon all were on board, and\r\nwhile Tom did his best to revive Bostwick, Dick and old Jerry bent\r\ntheir back to the oars, pulling as they had seldom pulled before.\r\n\r\nThe beach in front of the house was almost gained when they heard a\r\nshot ring out, followed by several others.\r\n\r\n\"Just as I feared!\" groaned Dick. \"Lesher and the others have begun\r\nthe attack!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll have to be careful how we land,\" said old Jerry. \"If we\r\naint, we may run right into 'em!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no moon, but the stars shone brightly, so the beach line\r\nwas dimly visible in the distance. Standing up in the bow, Tom saw\r\na flash of fire from the jungle below the house, and heard the crack\r\nof a firearm. Then he saw some dark forms running along the beach.\r\n\r\n\"Our party is making for the cave!\" he cried. \"We had better turn in\r\nthat direction.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral other shots followed, but they could not tell if anybody was\r\nhit. In the distance several rum-crazed sailors were yelling like so\r\nmany Indians.\r\n\r\nBostwick came to his senses just as the sand was reached.\r\n\r\n\"Whe--where am I?\" he asked feebly. \"Oh, my feet!\"\r\n\r\n\"We have brought you with us, Bostwick,\" answered Dick. \"Keep still,\r\nand we will do what we can for you.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible they took the hurt man up, and all started for\r\nthe entrance to the cave.\r\n\r\n\"Who goes there?\" cried a voice out of the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Sam?\" called back Dick.\r\n\r\n\"Dick! I am glad you are back. They attacked the house, and we are\r\ngoing to the cave to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we know all about it, Sam. We have brought one of the sailors\r\nalong. He is badly, burnt. Are the girls safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess so. We told them to go ahead,\" answered Sam.\r\n\r\nCarrying Bostwick between them, Dick and old Jerry soon reached the\r\ncave, where they found the three girls standing in a group, each full\r\nof dread over what was occurring. Hardly had they gotten inside when\r\nCaptain Blossom came up on a run, accompanied by Gibson and Marny.\r\n\r\n\"Back, are you?\" he said. \"I am glad to see it. But it may put you\r\nin a tight hole. Hullo, so you've got Bostwick with you, eh? Everybody\r\nget into the cave, just as quick as you can.\"\r\n\r\nOnce inside of the cave Captain Blossom commanded everybody to he\r\nsilent. The hurt sailor was carried to the inner chamber, where a\r\nlantern was lit, for it would be impossible to see this light from\r\noutside. Then the girls set to work to make Bostwick comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"Has anybody been shot?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I got a bullet scratch on the arm,\" answered the captain. \"And Marny\r\ngot a few buck-shot in his shoulder. But neither of the hurts amount\r\nto anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think the mutineers will do next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ransack the house first,\" said Sam. \"Oh, but they are a bad crowd!\r\nThey came on like a lot of demons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course Baxter was with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but he kept in the background, for fear, I suppose, of being shot.\"\r\n\r\nWith caution one after another left the mouth of the cave to look in\r\nthe direction of the house. No one outside of their own party was\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a glare lit up the scene, growing brighter each instant.\r\n\r\n\"By the great boots!\" ejaculated Captain Blossom. \"They have set the\r\nhouse on fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"That shows how crazy they are,\" declared Dick. \"In their rage they\r\nare liable to do anything. Ten to one they get to fighting between\r\nthemselves before this is over.\"\r\n\r\nThe house, being built of semi-green logs, burnt slowly. As it was\r\nconsumed, they heard some of the sailors singing and yelling, and\r\nheard several pistol shots and a scream of pain.\r\n\r\n\"Some of them are coming now!\" announced Sam, half an hour later.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody get back out of sight,\" cried Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\nThere was a wild scramble, and in the rush Tom tripped and fell. His\r\nfoot struck a stone, which went rolling down to the mutineers' feet.\r\n\r\n\"Hi! hi! there they are!\" came in a rough, thick voice.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" roared back the voice of Jack Lesher.\r\n\r\n\"Up there, among the rocks and bushes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go after 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoot 'em down, boys! They deserve it for burning up the ship!\"\r\n\r\nUp the rocks came the hard-drunken sailors, accompanied by Lesher,\r\nand with Dan Baxter in their rear.\r\n\r\n\"Back! back! All of you, stand back!\" cried Captain Blossom. \"Come\r\na step nearer at your peril. We are all armed and ready to fire!\"\r\n\r\nAt these words the sailors halted for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Say, cap'n, why did you set the ship afire?\" asked an unsteady voice.\r\n\r\n\"We had nothing to do with that,\" answered Captain Blossom. \"We were\r\nall over on this island when the blaze started.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a lie!\" came in the voice of Lesher.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's a lie,\" added Dan Baxter. \"They did their best to\r\nburn every one of us up.\r\n\r\n\"It is the truth,\" cried Dick. \"Now stand back, or we shall fire on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" yelled Lesher, and fired a pistol at those near the mouth\r\nof the cave.\r\n\r\n\"If ever I get the chance to have you tried, every one of you shall\r\nbe hung for mutiny and murder!\" cried Captain Blossom, and then fired\r\nin return.\r\n\r\nThe bullet hit Dan Baxter in the arm, and he fell back with a shriek\r\nof pain.\r\n\r\n\"I am killed! I am killed!\" he moaned, and ran down toward the beach.\r\n\r\nThen came a volley from the mutineers, followed by one from those in\r\nthe cave.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a close 'shave!\" muttered Tom. A bullet had grazed his ear,\r\ncutting away one of his curly locks.\r\n\r\nLesher was wounded in the shoulder, and in a moment more of the\r\nmutineers ran off, feeling that they were at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\"They can see us out in the open, while we can't see them for the\r\nrocks and bushes,\" said one sailor. \"Let us wait till morning \"; and\r\nso it was decided.\r\n\r\nInside of the cave a council of war was held, and it was decided to\r\nblock up the entrance fronting the bay with large rocks, leaving only\r\ntwo loopholes open, for watching and for possible shooting.\r\n\r\nAll of the wounded ones were cared for, and then a watch was set. In\r\nthe meantime Bostwick was put at ease, and he told the particulars\r\nof what happened on the burning wreck, and how Lesher and Baxter had\r\nurged the mutineers to attack those at the house.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the night wore away slowly. Nothing more was seen\r\nof the mutineers, who had retired to the jungle, drank more liquor,\r\nand gone to sleep, Baxter with them, moaning and groaning over his\r\nwound.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to take a look around,\" said Tom, early in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"A look around where?\" asked Dick.\r\n\r\n\"From where we have the signal of distress. I don't believe any of\r\nthe mutineers are in that vicinity.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go with you,\" put in Sam, and so it was decided.\r\n\r\nIt was an easy matter for the two boys to make their way to the gully\r\nentrance, and with great caution they climbed out of the opening and\r\nwalked to where the flag of distress floated in the breeze. Not a\r\nsight of the mutineers or Dan Baxter was to be had in any direction.\r\n\r\n\"They are either sleeping, or else they are afraid we'll shoot at\r\nthem if they show themselves,\" said Tom. And he added: \"I am going\r\nto climb the tree and take a look around.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be careful,\" cautioned Sam; nevertheless, he went up the tall tree\r\nwith his brother.\r\n\r\nOnce in the tree, directly under the flag, they took a careful look\r\naround the island and then out to sea.\r\n\r\n\"My gracious, Sam, look!\" screamed Tom suddenly, and pointed out to\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\n\"A ship! A ship!\" ejaculated Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and do you see what kind of a ship it is? A warship, and an\r\nAmerican warship at that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah, Tom; we are saved!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! yes! They are sailing this way. Our flag of distress has been\r\nseen! Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must tell the others right away.\"\r\n\r\nBoth slid down the tree with all haste. As they reached the bottom\r\na gun boomed out across the waves.\r\n\r\n\"That is to let us know that our signal has been seen,\" said Tom.\r\n\"Won't the others be delighted when they know a ship, an American\r\nship at that, is so close at hand!\"\r\n\r\nAs quickly as they could they reentered the cave and ran to where\r\nthey had left the others.\r\n\r\nThe good news spread like lightning.\r\n\r\n\"A ship! an American warship is coming!\" was the cry.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how thankful I am,\" came from Dora.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do next?\" asked Nellie, with tears of joy streaming\r\ndown her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"We'll go to the shore and meet the small boat that is sent in,\"\r\nanswered Captain Blossom.\r\n\r\nWithout delay he set out, accompanied by Dick and old Jerry, leaving\r\nthe others to defend the cave during his absence.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two hours before he returned.\r\n\r\n\"The ship is the cruiser _Jefferson_,\" he said. \"She is bound for\r\nHonolulu, to await orders. The captain says he will take us on board\r\nwillingly, and he will do what he can to help us bring those other\r\nfellows to justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Tom. \"If that is so, then our troubles as castaways\r\nare over.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we are not sorry,\" said Grace. \"Not a bit sorry.\"\r\n\r\nAnd all of the others agreed with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few words more and I will bring to a close this story of the Rover\r\nboys' adventures on land and sea.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the warship was true to his word, and before nightfall\r\nall who had been in the cave were safe on board of the Jefferson.\r\nThose who were wounded or hurt were given the best of medical attention,\r\nand everybody was made comfortable.\r\n\r\n\"What attracted me to the islands was the bright reflection in the\r\nsky when the wreck was burnt,\" said the captain of the cruiser. \"I\r\nthought perhaps that a volcano had become active. But at daybreak we\r\nsaw nothing unusual, and were about to turn away when the lookout\r\ndiscovered your flag of distress.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do about the mutineers and Dan Baxter?\" asked Dick.\r\n\r\n\"We'll bring them to justice, if we can, lad.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a visit was paid to the burnt house nobody was in sight. But\r\nin the woods nearby a wounded sailor was discovered. He was badly\r\nhurt, and, though given every care, died two days later while on\r\nshipboard.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have a job finding Lesher, Baxter, and the others,\" he said,\r\nwhen being attended. \"They said they wouldn't give in to anybody,\r\nand when they learned the warship was here they rowed away in a boat\r\nfor one of the other islands, They'll hide away until after you are\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's the case, let them stay here,\" said Captain Blossom. \"It\r\nwill be punishment enough for them to live here without any stores.\"\r\n\r\n\"They may find those at the cave,\" said Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Even so, those stores won't last forever,\" said Dick. \"Yes, they\r\nwill be punished enough, for there is no telling when another ship\r\nwill stop here and take them away.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than likely they'll have to remain here a year or two,\" said\r\nCaptain Blossom.\r\n\r\nEverything of value was taken to the warship, and twenty-four hours\r\nlater the Jefferson steamed away on her journey to the Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\n\"How glad mother will be to learn that I am safe!\" said Dora to Dick.\r\n\r\n\"It will be good news to all of our folks,\" answered Dick. \"They will\r\nwelcome us as from the grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope we can get a steamer directly from Honolulu to San Francisco,\"\r\nsaid Tom. \"Our little vacation has proved unusually long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that we will ever see Dan Baxter again?\" questioned Sam.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly think so,\" said Dick. \"After what has happened he will not\r\ndare to show his face again.\" But Dan Baxter did show himself, and\r\nwhat he did to harm the Rover boys in the future will be told in\r\nanother volume of this series, entitled \"The Rover Boys in Camp; or The\r\nRivals of Pine Island,\" in which we shall meet many of our old friends\r\nagain. It may be as well to mention here that Baxter and two sailors\r\nescaped from the seven islands just one week after our friends left it.\r\nThe others, including Jack Lesher, lost their lives while in a quarrel\r\nover the last bottle of rum which the mate had brought with him from\r\nthe burning wreck. Their taking off was an awful example of the evils\r\nof intemperance.\r\n\r\nIt was soon seen that Bostwick was not seriously burnt, and before\r\nthe trip to Honolulu was over he was able to sit up and to walk a\r\nlittle. The wounds of those who had been shot proved slight.\r\n\r\n\"We are well out of that adventure,\" said Tom one evening, as the\r\nRover boys and the girls sat on the deck in the starlight. \"And I\r\ndon't know as I want to go through anything like it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"All I am thinking of is home, sweet home,\" said Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Just what was in my mind,\" answered Dick. \"How father and Uncle\r\nRandolph and Aunt Martha will welcome us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us sing,\" put in Dora, and in a moment more all were singing\r\nthe first verse of \"Home, Sweet Home\"; and here let us bid them\r\ngood-by.",
