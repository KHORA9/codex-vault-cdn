BROWNE, M.A.\r\n\r\n  FELLOW AND ASSISTANT TUTOR OF ST. CATHARINE'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE;\r\n  MEMBER OF THE ALPINE CLUB.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence of natural ice-caves at depths varying from 50 to 200 feet\r\nbelow the surface of the earth, unconnected with glaciers or snow\r\nmountains, and in latitudes and at altitudes where ice could not under\r\nordinary circumstances be supposed to exist, has attracted some\r\nattention on the Continent; but little or nothing seems to be\r\npractically known in England on the subject. These caves are so\r\nsingular, and many of them so well repay inspection, that a description\r\nof the twelve which I have visited can scarcely, as it seems to me, be\r\nconsidered an uncalled-for addition to the numerous books of travel\r\nwhich are constantly appearing. In order to prevent my narrative from\r\nbeing a mere dry record of natural phenomena, I have interspersed it\r\nwith such incidents of travel as may be interesting in themselves or\r\nuseful to those who are inclined to follow my steps. I have also given,\r\nfrom various sources, accounts of similar caves in different parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nA pamphlet on _Glacières Naturelles_ by M. Thury, of Geneva, of the\r\nexistence of which I was not aware when I commenced my explorations, has\r\nbeen of great service to me. M. Thury had only visited three glacières\r\nwhen he published his pamphlet in 1861, but the observations he records\r\nare very valuable. He had attempted to visit a fourth, when,\r\nunfortunately, the want of a ladder of sufficient length stopped him.\r\n\r\nI was allowed to read Papers before the British Association at Bath\r\n(1864), in the Chemical Section, on the prismatic formation of the ice\r\nin these caves, and in the Geological Section, on their general\r\ncharacter and the possible causes of their existence.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to say, with regard to the sections given in this book,\r\nthat, while the proportions of the masses of ice are in accordance with\r\nmeasurements taken on the spot, the interior height of many of the\r\ncaves, and the curves of the roof and sides, are put in with a free\r\nhand, some of them from memory. And of the measurements, too, it is only\r\nfair to say that they were taken for the most part under very\r\nunfavourable circumstances, in dark caves lighted by one, or sometimes\r\nby two candles, with a temperature varying from slightly above to\r\nslightly below the freezing-point, and with no surer foot-hold than that\r\nafforded by slippery slopes of ice and chaotic blocks of stone. In all\r\ncases, errors are due to want of skill, not of honesty; and I hope that\r\nthey do not generally lie on the side of exaggeration.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE: _June_ 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.

The son of the house was an intelligent man, with a good\r\nknowledge of the natural curiosities which abound in that remarkable\r\nrange of hills, and under his guidance we saw many strange things. More\r\nthan once, he spoke of the existence of a _glacière_ at no great\r\ndistance, and talked of taking us to see it; but we were sceptical on\r\nthe subject, imagining that _glacière_ was his patois for _glacier_, and\r\nknowing that anything of the glacier kind was out of the question. At\r\nlast, however, on a hot day in August, we set off with him, armed, at\r\nhis request, with candles; and, after two or three hours of pine\r\nforests, and grass glades, and imaginary paths up rocky ranges of hill\r\ntowards the summits of the Jura, we came to a deep natural pit, down the\r\nside of which we scrambled. At the bottom, after penetrating a few yards\r\ninto a chasm in the rock, we discovered a small low cave, perfectly\r\ndark, with a flooring of ice, and a pillar of the same material in the\r\nform of a headless woman, one of whose shoulders we eventually carried\r\noff, to regale our parched friends at Arzier. We lighted up the cave\r\nwith candles, and sat crouched on the ice drinking our wine, finding\r\nwater, which served the double purpose of icing and diluting the wine,\r\nin small basins in the floor of ice, formed apparently by drops falling\r\nfrom the roof of the cave.\r\n\r\nA few days after, our guide and companion took us to an ice-cavern on a\r\nlarger scale, which, we were told, supplies Geneva with ice when the\r\nordinary stores of that town fail; and the next year my sisters went to\r\nyet another, where, however, they did not reach the ice, as the ladder\r\nnecessary for the final drop was not forthcoming.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the last year or two, I have mentioned these glacières\r\nnow and then in England, and no one has seemed to know anything about\r\nthem; so I determined, in the spring of 1864, to spend a part of the\r\nsummer in examining the three we had already seen or heard of, and\r\ndiscovering, if possible, the existence of similar caves.\r\n\r\nThe first that came under my notice was the Glacière of La Genollière;\r\nand, though it is smaller and less interesting than most of those which\r\nI afterwards visited, many of its general features are merely reproduced\r\non a larger scale in them. I shall therefore commence with this cave,\r\nand proceed with the account of my explorations in their natural order.\r\nIt is probable that some of the earlier details may seem to be somewhat\r\ntedious, but they are necessary for a proper understanding of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nLa Genollière is the _montagne_, or mountain pasturage and wood,\r\nbelonging to the village of Genollier, an ancient priory of the monks of\r\nS. Claude.[1] The cave itself lies at no great distance from Arzier--a\r\nvillage which may be seen in profile from the Grand Quai of Geneva,\r\nambitiously climbing towards the summit of the last slope of the Jura.\r\nTo reach the cave from Geneva, it would be necessary to take train or\r\nsteamer to Nyon, whence an early omnibus runs to S. Cergues, if crawling\r\nup the serpentine road can be called running; and from S. Cergues a\r\nguide must be taken across the Fruitière de Nyon, if anyone can be found\r\nwho knows the way. From Arzier, however, which is nine miles up from\r\nNyon, it was not necessary to take the S. Cergues route; and we went\r\nstraight through the woods, past the site of an old convent and its\r\ndrained fish-pond, and up the various rocky ridges of hill, with no\r\nguide beyond the recollection of the previous visits two and three years\r\nbefore, and a sort of idea that we must go north-west. As it was not yet\r\nJuly, the cows had not made their summer move to the higher châlets, and\r\nwe found the mountains uninhabited and still.\r\n\r\nThe point to be made for is the upper Châlet of La Genollière, called by\r\nsome of the people _La Baronne_, [2] though the district map puts La\r\nBaronne at some distance from the site of the glacière. We had some\r\ndifficulty in finding the châlet, and were obliged to spread out now and\r\nthen, that each might hunt a specified portion of the wood or glade for\r\nsigns to guide our further advance, enjoying meanwhile the lilies of the\r\nmountain and lilies of the valley, and fixing upon curious trees and\r\nplants as landmarks for our return. In crossing the last grass, we found\r\nthe earliest vanilla orchis (_Orchis nigra_) of the year, and came upon\r\nbeds of moonwort (_Botrychium Lunaria_) of so unusual a size that our\r\nprogress ceased till such time as the finest specimens were secured.\r\n\r\nSome time before reaching this point, we caught a glimpse of a dark\r\nspeck on the highest summit in sight, which recalled pleasantly a night\r\nwe had spent there three years before for the purpose of seeing the sun\r\nrise.[3] My sisters had revisited the Châlet des Chèvres, which this\r\ndark speck represented, in 1862, and found that the small chamber in\r\nwhich we had slept on planks and logs had become a more total ruin than\r\nbefore, in the course of the winter, so that it is now utterly\r\nuntenable.\r\n\r\nFrom Arzier to the Châlet of La Genollière, would be about two hours,\r\nfor a man walking and mounting quickly, and never losing the way; and\r\nthe glacière lies a few minutes farther to the north-west, at an\r\nelevation of about 2,800 feet above the lake, or 4,000 feet above the\r\nsea.[4] A rough mountain road, leading over an undulating expanse of\r\ngrass, passes narrowly between two small clumps of trees, each\r\nsurrounded by a low circular wall, the longer diameter of the\r\nenclosure on the south side of the road being 60 feet. In this\r\nenclosure is a natural pit, of which the north side is a sheer rock,\r\nof the ordinary limestone of the Jura, with a chasm almost from the\r\ntop; while the south side is less steep, and affords the means of\r\nscrambling down to the bottom, where a cave is found at the foot of\r\nthe chasm, passing under the road. The floor of this small but\r\ncomparatively lofty cave is 52 feet below the surface of the earth,\r\nand slopes away rapidly to the west, where, by the help of candles,\r\nthe rock which forms the wall is seen to stop short of the floor,\r\nleaving an entrance 2 or 3 feet high to an inner cave--the glacière.\r\nThe roof of this inner cave rises slightly, and its floor falls, so\r\nthat there is a height of about 6 feet inside, excepting where a large\r\nopen fissure in the roof passes high up towards the world above. At\r\none end, neither the roof nor the floor slopes much, and in this part\r\nof the cave the height is less than 3 feet.\r\n\r\nIt would be very imprudent to go straight into an ice-cave after a long\r\nwalk on a hot summer's day, so we prepared to dine under the shade of\r\nthe trees at the edge of the pit, and I went down into the cave for a\r\nfew moments to get a piece of ice for our wine. My first impression was\r\nthat the glacière was entirely destroyed, for the outer cave was a mere\r\nchaos of rock and stones; but, on further investigation, it turned out\r\nthat the ruin had not reached the inner cave. In our previous visit we\r\nhad noticed a natural basin of some size and depth among the trees on\r\nthe north side of the road, and we now found that the chaos was the\r\nresult of a recent falling-in of this basin; so that from the bottom of\r\nthe first cave, standing as it were under the road, we could see\r\ndaylight through the newly-formed hole.\r\n\r\nThe total length of the floor of the inner cave, which lies north-east\r\nand south-west, is 51 feet; and of this floor a length of about 37 feet\r\nwas more or less covered with ice, the greatest breadth of the ice being\r\nwithin an inch or two of 11 feet. Excepting in the part of the cave\r\nalready mentioned as being less than 3 feet high, we found the floor not\r\nnearly so dry, nor so completely covered with ice, as when we first saw\r\nthe glacière, three years before, in the middle of an exceptionally hot\r\nAugust. Under the low roof all was very dry, though even there the ice\r\nhad not an average thickness of more than 8 inches. It may be as well to\r\nsay, once for all, that the ice in these caves is never found in a sheet\r\non a pool of water; it is always solid, forming the floor of the cave,\r\nfilling up the interstices of the loose stones, and rising above them,\r\nin this case with a surface perfectly level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICE-COLUMNS IN THE GLACIÈRE OF LA GENOLLIÈRE.]\r\n\r\nWe found four principal columns of ice, three of which, in the loftiest\r\npart of the cave, are represented in the accompanying engraving: I call\r\nthem three, and not two, because the two which unite in a common base\r\nproceeded from different fissures. The line of light at the foot of the\r\nrock-wall is the only entrance to the glacière. The lowest column was\r\n11-2/3 feet high and 1-2/3 feet broad, not more than 6 inches thick in\r\nthe middle, half-way up, and flattened symmetrically so as to be\r\ncomparatively sharp at the edges, like a huge double-edged sword. It\r\nstood clear of the rock through its whole height, but scarcely left room\r\nbetween itself and the wall of the cave for a candle to be passed up and\r\ndown. The other two columns shown in the engraving poured out of\r\nfissures in the rock, streaming down as cascades, the one being 13-1/2\r\nand the other 15 feet high; and when we tied a candle to the end of an\r\nalpenstock, and passed it into the fissures, we found that the bend of\r\nthe fissures prevented our seeing the termination of the ice. An\r\nintermittent disturbance of the air in these fissures made the flame\r\nflicker at intervals, though generally the candle burned steadily in\r\nthem, and we could detect no current in the cave. The fourth column was\r\nin the low part of the cave, and we were obliged to grovel on the ice to\r\nget its dimensions: it was 3-1/4 feet broad and 4-1/3 feet high, the\r\nroof of the cave being only 2-3/4 feet high; and it poured out of the\r\nvertical fissure like a smooth round fall of water, adhering lightly to\r\nthe rock at its upper end like a fungus, and growing out suddenly in its\r\nfull size. This column was dry, whereas on the others there were\r\nabundant symptoms of moisture, as if small quantities of water were\r\ntrickling down them from their fissures, though the fissures themselves\r\nappeared to be perfectly dry.\r\n\r\nIn one of the fissures there was a patch of what is known as\r\nsweating-stone, [5] with globules of water oozing out, and standing\r\nroundly upon it: the globules were not frozen. This stone was\r\nexceedingly hard, and defied all our efforts to break off a specimen,\r\nbut at last we got two small pieces, hard and heavy, and wrapped them\r\nin paper; ten weeks after, we found them of course quite dry, and\r\nbroke them easily, small as they were, with our fingers. The fissure\r\nfrom which the shortest of the four columns came was full of gnats, as\r\nwere also several crevices in the walls of the cave, especially in the\r\nlowest part; and we found a number of large red-brown flies, [6]\r\nnearly an inch long, running rapidly on the ice and stones, after the\r\nfashion of the flies with which trout love best to be taken. The\r\ncentral parts of the cave, where the roof is high, were in a state\r\nprovincially known as 'sloppy,' and drops of water fell now and then\r\nfrom above, either splashing on wet stones, or hollowing out basins in\r\nthe remaining ice, or, sometimes, shrewdly detecting the most\r\nsensitive spot in the back of the human neck. We placed one of\r\nCasella's thermometers on a piece of wood on one of the wet stones,\r\nclear of the ice, and it soon fell to 34°. Probably the temperature\r\nhad been somewhat raised by the continued presence of three human\r\nbeings and two lighted candles in the small cavern; and, at any rate,\r\nthe cold of two degrees above freezing was something very real on a\r\nhot summer's day, and told considerably upon my sisters, so that we\r\nwere compelled to beat a retreat,--not quite in time, for one of our\r\nparty could not effect a thaw, even by stamping about violently in the\r\nfull afternoon sun.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in the cave, we noticed that the surfaces of the columns\r\nwere covered by very irregular lines, marked somewhat deeply in the\r\nice, and dividing the surface into areas of all shapes, a sort of\r\nnetwork, with meshes of many different shapes and sizes. These areas\r\nwere smaller towards the edges of the columns; the lines containing\r\nthem were not, as a rule, straight lines, and almost baffled our\r\nefforts to count them, but, to the best of my belief, there were\r\nmeshes with three, four, and up to eight sides. The column which\r\nstood clear of the rock was composed of very limpid ice, without\r\nadmixture of air; but the cascades were interpenetrated by veins of\r\nlooser white ice, and, where the white ice came, the surface lines\r\nseemed to disappear. As we sat on the grass outside, arranging our\r\nproperties for departure, my attention was arrested by the columnar\r\nappearance of the fractured edge of the block of ice which we had used\r\nat luncheon. It was about 5 inches thick, and had formed part of a\r\nstalagmite whose horizontal section, like that of the free column,\r\nwould be an ellipse of considerable eccentricity; and, on examination,\r\nit turned out that the surface areas, which varied in size from a\r\nlarge thumb-nail to something very small, were the ends of prisms\r\nreaching through to the other side of the piece of ice, at any rate in\r\nthe thinner parts, and presenting there similar faces. Not only so,\r\nbut the prisms could be detached with great ease, by using no\r\ninstrument more violent than the fingers; while the point of a thin\r\nknife entered freely at any of the surface lines, and split the ice\r\nneatly down the sides of the prisms. When one or two of the sides of a\r\nprism were exposed, at the edge of the piece of ice, the prism could\r\nbe pushed out entire, like a knot from the edge of a piece of wood. In\r\nsome cases there seemed to be capillary fissures coincident with the\r\nlines where several sides of prisms met. Considering the shape of the\r\nwhole column, it is clear that the two ends of each prism could not be\r\nparallel; neither was one of the ends perfectly symmetrical with the\r\nother, and I do not think that the prisms were of the nature of\r\ntruncated pyramids. On descending again, I found that the columns\r\nwere without exception formed of this prismatic ice, either in whole,\r\nas in the clear column, or in part, as where limpid prisms existed\r\namong the white ice which ran in veins down the cascades. In the free\r\nvertical column the prisms seemed to be deposited horizontally, and in\r\nthe thicker parts they did not pass clear through. We carried a large\r\npiece of ice down to Arzier in a botanical tin, and on our arrival\r\nthere we found that all traces of external lines had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis visit to the glacière was on Saturday, and on the following Monday\r\nI determined to go up alone, to take a registering thermometer, and\r\nleave it in the cave for the night; which, of course, would entail a\r\nthird visit on the next day. Monday brought a steady penetrating rain,\r\nof that peculiar character which six Scotch springs had taught me to\r\ndescribe as 'just a bit must;' while in the higher regions the fog was\r\nso hopeless, that a sudden lift of the mist revealed the unpleasant fact\r\nthat considerable progress had been made in a westerly direction, the\r\ntrue line being north-west. Instead of the rocks of La Genollière, the\r\nforeground presented was the base of the Dôle, and the chasm which\r\naffords a passage from the well-known fortress of Les Rousses into Vaud.\r\nThere was nothing for it but to turn in the right direction, or attempt\r\nto do so, and force a way through the wet woods till something should\r\nturn up. This something took the form of a châlet; but no amount of\r\nhammering and shouting produced any response, and it was only after a\r\nforcible entrance, and a prolonged course of interior shouting, that a\r\nman was at length drawn. He said that he had been asleep--and why he\r\nput it in a past tense is still a mystery--and could give no idea of\r\nthe direction of the châlet on La Genollière, beyond a vague suggestion\r\nthat it was somewhere in the mist; a suggestion by no means improbable,\r\nseeing that the mist was ubiquitous. One piece of information he was\r\nable to give, and it was consoling: I was now, it seemed, on the\r\nFruitière de Nyon, and therefore the desired châlet could not be far\r\noff, if only a guide could be found. On the whole, he thought that a\r\nguide could not be found; but there were men in the châlet, and I might\r\ngo up the ladder with him and see what could be done. He led to a\r\nchamber with a window of one small pane, dating apparently from the\r\nfirst invention of glass, and never cleaned since. An invisible corner\r\nof the room was appealed to; but the voice which resided there, and\r\nseemed like everything else to be asleep, pleaded dreamily a total\r\nignorance of the whereabouts of the châlet in question. Just as, by dint\r\nof steady staring through the darkness, an indistinct form of a\r\nmattress, with a human being reclining thereon, began to be visible,\r\nanother dark corner announced that this new speaker had heard of a\r\n_p'tit sentier_ leading to the châlet, but knew neither direction nor\r\ndistance. Here the space between the two corners put in a word; and, as\r\nthe darkness was now becoming natural, seven or eight mattresses\r\nappeared, ranged round the room, some holding one, some two men, most of\r\nwhom were sitting up on end with old caps on, displaying every variety\r\nof squalor. The voice which had spoken last declared that the distance\r\nwas three-quarters of an hour, and that if the day were clear there\r\nwould be no difficulty in reaching the châlet; as it was, the man would\r\nbe very glad to try.\r\n\r\nA change of cap was the only dressing necessary for the volunteer, and\r\nwe faced the fog and rain, which elicited from him such a disgraceful\r\namount of swearing, that it was on all accounts well when the rain\r\nceased for a few minutes, the mists rolled off, and the clouds lifted\r\nsufficiently to betray the surface of the Lake of Geneva, luxuriating in\r\nthe clear warmth of an early summer's day, and making us shiver by the\r\npainful contrast which our own altitude presented. The deep blue of the\r\nlake brought to mind the story of the shepherd of Gessenay (Saanen), of\r\nwhom it is told that when he was passing the hills with some friends for\r\na first visit to Vevey, and came in sight of the lake, which he had\r\nnever seen before, he turned and hurried home incontinent, declaring\r\nthat he would not enter a country where the good God had made the blue\r\nsky to fall and fill the valleys.\r\n\r\nIn this bright interval we came upon a magnificent fox, and the\r\npeasant's impulse was, 'Oh, for a good gun!' an exclamation which would\r\nhave sounded horrible to English ears, if I had not been previously\r\nbroken in to it by an invitation from a Scotch gamekeeper to a fox-hunt,\r\nwhen he promised an excellent gun, and a _stance_ which the foxes were\r\nsure to pass.\r\n\r\nThe rain now came on again, and the guide thought he had had plenty of\r\nit, and must return for the afternoon milking; and just then, as good\r\nluck would have it, we stumbled upon an immense clump of nettles which\r\nhad been one of our landmarks two days before, so that he was no longer\r\nnecessary, and we said affectionate adieux.\r\n\r\nThe glacière was in a state of ruin. Only the right-hand column, not\r\nspeaking heraldically, was standing, the others lying in blocks frozen\r\nhard together on the ground. The column which still stood was much\r\nshrunken, and seemed too small for its fissure, the sides of which it\r\nscarcely touched. The wind blew down the entrance slope so\r\ndeterminedly, that a candle found it difficult to live at the bottom\r\nof the first cave; and a portion of the current blew into the\r\nglacière, and in its sweep exactly struck the fallen columns, the\r\nedges of which were already rounded by thaw. Much of this must be\r\nattributed to the recent opening of the second shaft (p. 5), which\r\nadmits a thorough draught through the first cave, and so exposes the\r\nglacière to currents of warmer air; and I should expect to find that\r\nin future the ice will disappear from that part of the cave every\r\nsummer, [7] whereas in 1861 we found it thick and dry (excepting a few\r\nsmall basins containing water) and evidently permanent, in the middle\r\nof a very hot August. The low part of the cave was so completely\r\nprotected from the current, that the candle burned there quite\r\nsteadily for an hour and a half: still, like the others, the column at\r\nthat end of the glacière was broken down, and it therefore became\r\nnecessary to attribute its fall to some other agency than the current\r\nof external air. There had been a very large amount of rain, and the\r\nsurface of the rock in the fissures was evidently wet; so I have no\r\ndoubt that the filtering through of the warm rain-water had thawed the\r\nupper supports of the ice-cascades, and then, owing to their slightly\r\ninclined position, the pedestal had not provided sufficient support,\r\nand so they had fallen. One of them, perhaps, had brought down in its\r\nfall the free column, which had stood two days before on its own base,\r\nwithout any support from the rock. Very probably, too--indeed, almost\r\ncertainly,--the fall of the large mass of rock, which once formed the\r\nbottom of the basin on the north side of the road, has affected the\r\nold-established fissures, by which rain-water has been accustomed to\r\npenetrate in small quantities to the glacière, so that now a much\r\nlarger amount is admitted. On this account, there will probably be a\r\ngreat diminution of the ice in the course of future summers, though\r\nthe amount formed each winter may be greater than it has hitherto\r\nbeen. Constant examination of other columns and fissures has convinced\r\nme, that, before the end of autumn, the majority of the glacières will\r\nhave lost all the columns which depend upon the roof for a part of\r\ntheir support, or spring from fissures in the wall; whereas those\r\nwhich are true stalagmites, and are self-supporting, will have a much\r\nbetter chance of remaining through the warm season, and lasting till\r\nthe winter, and so increasing in size from year to year. Free\r\nstalagmites, however, which are formed under fissures capable of\r\npouring down a large amount of water on the occasion of a great flood\r\nof rain, must succumb in time, though not so soon as the supported\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nA curious appearance was presented by a small free stalagmite in the\r\nretired part of the cave. The surface of the stalagmite was wet, from\r\nthe drops proceeding from a fissure above, and was lightly covered in\r\nmany parts with a calcareous deposit, brought down from the fissures in\r\nthe roof by the water filtering through. The stalagmite was of the\r\ndouble-edged-sword shape, and the limestone deposit collected chiefly at\r\none of its edges, the edge nearer to that part of the cave where thaw\r\nprevailed; so that the real edge was a ridge of deposit beyond the edge\r\nof the ice.[8] Patches of limestone paste lay on many parts of the\r\nice-floor.\r\n\r\nIn the loftier part of the cave, water dropped from the roof to so\r\nlarge an extent, that ninety-six drops of water in a minute splashed\r\non to a small stone immediately under the main fissure. This stone was\r\nin the centre of a considerable area of the floor which was clear of\r\nice; and it struck me that if the columns were formed by the freezing\r\nof water dropping from the roof, there ought to have been at some time\r\na large column under this, the most plentiful source of water in the\r\ncave. Accordingly, I found that the edge of the ice round this clear\r\narea was much thicker than the rest of the ice of the floor, and was\r\nevidently the remains of the swelling pedestal of a column which had\r\nbeen about 12 feet in circumference. This departed column may account\r\nfor a fact which I discovered in another glacière, and found to be of\r\nvery common occurrence, viz., that in large stalagmites there is a\r\nconsiderable internal cavity, extending some feet up from the ground,\r\nand affording room even for a man to walk about inside the column.\r\nWhen the melted snows of spring send down to the cave, through the\r\nfissures of the rock, an abundance of water at a very low\r\ntemperature, and the cave itself is stored with the winter's cold,\r\nthese thicker rings of ice catch first the descending water, and so a\r\ncircular wall, naturally conical, is formed round the area of stones;\r\nthe remaining water either running off through the interstices, or\r\nforming a floor of ice of less thickness, which yields to the next\r\nsummer's drops. In the course of time, this conical wall rises,\r\nnarrowing always, till a dome-like roof is at length formed, and\r\nthenceforth the column is solid. Of course, the interior cannot be\r\nwholly free from ice; and it will be seen from the account of one of\r\nthese cavities, which I explored in the Schafloch, that they are\r\ndecked with ice precisely as might be expected.[9] Another possible\r\nexplanation of this curious and beautiful phenomenon will be given\r\nhereafter.[10]\r\n\r\nThe temperature was half a degree lower than when there were three of us\r\nin the cave two days before. I deposited one of Casella's registering\r\nthermometers, on wood, on a stone in that part of the floor which was\r\nfree from ice, though there was ice all round it at some little\r\ndistance. The thermometer was well above the surface of the ice, and\r\nwas protected from chance drops of water from the roof.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I started early from Arzier, having an afternoon\r\njourney in prospect to the neighbourhood of another glacière, and was\r\naccompanied by Captain Douglas Smith, of the 4th Regiment. On our way to\r\nLa Genollière, we came across the man who had served as guide the day\r\nbefore, and a short conversation respecting the glacière ensued. He had\r\nonly seen it once, many years before, and he held stoutly to the usual\r\nbelief of the peasantry, that the ice is formed in summer, and melts in\r\nwinter; a belief which everything I had then seen contradicted. His last\r\nwords as we parted were, '_Plus il fait chaud, plus ça gèle_;' and,\r\nparadoxical as it may appear, I believe that some truth was concealed in\r\nwhat he said, though not as he meant it. Considering that his ideas were\r\nconfined to his cattle and their requirements, and that water is often\r\nvery difficult to find in that part of the Jura, a _hot_ summer would\r\nprobably mean with him a _dry_ summer, that is, a summer which does not\r\nsend down much water to thaw the columns in the cave. Extra heat in the\r\nair outside, at any season, does not, as experience of these caves\r\nproves abundantly, produce very considerable disturbance of their low\r\ntemperature, and so summer water is a much worse enemy than extra summer\r\nheat; and if the caves could be protected from water in the hot season,\r\nthe columns in them would know how to resist the possible--but very\r\nsmall--increase of temperature due to the excess of heat of one summer\r\nabove another. And since the eye is most struck by the appearance of the\r\nstalagmites and ice-cascades, it may well be that the peasants have seen\r\nthese standing at the end of an unusually hot and dry summer, and have\r\nthence concluded that hot summers are the best time for the formation of\r\nice. Of course, at the beginning of the winter after a hot summer, there\r\nwill be on these terms a larger nucleus of ice; and so it will become\r\ntrue that the hotter the year, the more ice there will be, both during\r\nthe summer itself and after the following winter.\r\n\r\nThe further process of the formation of ice will be this:--the colds of\r\nearly winter will freeze all the water that may be in the glacières from\r\nthe summer's thaw, in such caves as do not possess a drainage, and then\r\nthe frost will have nothing to occupy itself upon but the ice already\r\nformed, for no water can descend from the frost-bound surface of the\r\nearth.[11] As soon as the snow begins to melt to so great a degree that\r\nthe fissures are opened up once more, the extremely cold water resulting\r\ntherefrom will descend through the limestone into a cave perfectly dry,\r\nand filled with an atmosphere many degrees below the freezing point,\r\nwhose frost-power eagerly lays hold of every drop of water which does\r\nnot make its escape in time by the drainage of the cave. Thus the spring\r\nmonths will be the great time of the formation of ice, and also of the\r\nraising of the temperature from some degrees below freezing to the more\r\ntemperate register at which I have generally found it, viz., rather\r\nabove than below 32°. Professor Tyndall very properly likens the\r\nexternal atmosphere to a ratchet-wheel, from its property of allowing\r\nthe passage of hot rays down to the surface of the earth, and resisting\r\ntheir return: it may equally be so described on other grounds, inasmuch\r\nas the cold and heavy atmosphere will sink in the winter into the pits\r\nwhich lead to glacières, and will refuse to be altogether displaced in\r\nsummer by anything short of solar radiation.\r\n\r\nWe found the one column of the previous day still standing, though\r\nevidently in an unhappy state of decay. The sharpness of its edges was\r\nwholly gone, and it was withered and contorted; there were two cracks\r\ncompletely through it, dividing it into three pieces 4 or 5 feet long,\r\nwhich were clearly on the point of coming down. Externally, the day was\r\nfine and warm, and so we found the cave comparatively dry, only one drop\r\nfalling in a minute on to the stone where ninety-six had fallen in the\r\nsame time the day before. The thermometer registered 32° as the greatest\r\ncold of the night, and still stood at that point when we took it up.\r\n\r\nWe spent some little time in exploring the neighbourhood of the pits, in\r\norder to find, if possible, the outlet for the drainage, but the ground\r\ndid not fall away sufficiently for any source from so low an origin to\r\nshow itself. The search was suggested by what I remembered of the\r\nGlacière of S. Georges three years before, where the people believe that\r\na small streamlet which issues from the bottom of a steep rock, some\r\ndistance off, owes its existence to the glacière.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In this neighbourhood, the _montagne_ of any _commune_ is\r\nrepresented by the feminine form of the name of the village: thus,\r\n_L'Arzière_ is the _montagne_ of Arzier, and _La Bassine_ of Bassin.\r\nThis has a curious effect in the case of some villages--such, for\r\ninstance, as S. Georges--one of the landmarks of the district between\r\nthe lakes of Joux and Geneva being the _Châlet de la S. Georges_, a\r\ngrammatical anomaly which puzzles a stranger descending the southernmost\r\nslope of the Jura from the Asile de Marchairuz. This law of formation is\r\nnot universal; for the _montagnes_ of Rolle and S. Livres are called the\r\n_Prè de Rolle_ and the _Prè de S. Livres_, while the _Fruitière de Nyon_\r\nis the rich upland possession of the town of that name.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Probably a relic of the time when the earlier Barons of\r\nCoppet possessed this district. The families of Grandson, Lesdiguières,\r\nand Dohna successively held the barony; and in later times the title _de\r\nCoppet_ hid a name more widely known, for on the Châlet of _Les\r\nBiolles_, some distance to the east of La Baronne, the name of _Auguste\r\nde Staël de Holstein de Coppet_ is carved, after the fashion of Swiss\r\nchâlets. This was Madame de Staël's son, who built Biolles in 1817; it\r\nwas afterwards sold to the commune of Nyon, and finally purchased by\r\nArzier two or three years ago.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: 'Cornhill Magazine,' June 1863, 'How we slept at the Châlet\r\ndes Chèvres.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This is only a guess, made from a comparison with the\r\nascertained heights of neighbouring points.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The patois of Vaud has a prettier name for this kind of\r\nstone--_le sex_ (or _scex) qui plliau_, the weeping-stone.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: I brought one of these to England, and am told that it is\r\nthe _Stenophylax hieroglyphicus_ of Stephens, or something very like\r\nthat fly.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Since writing this, I have been told that some English\r\nofficers who visited the cave in the August of 1864 found no ice in any\r\npart.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See also p. 231.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: P. 145.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: P. 301.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: It is possible that the freezing of the surface may play a\r\ncurious part in the phenomena of the spring season in such caves.\r\nSupposing the surface to be completely frost-bound, all atmospheric\r\npressure will be removed from the upper surface of the water in the long\r\nfissures, and thus water may be held in suspension, in the centre of\r\nlarge masses of fissured rock, during the winter months. The first\r\nthorough thaw will have the same effect as the removal of the thumb from\r\nthe upper orifice in the case of the hand-shower-bath; and the water\r\nthus rained down into the cave will have a temperature sufficiently high\r\nto destroy some portion of the cold stored up by the descent of the\r\nheavy atmosphere of winter, or at least to melt out the ice which may\r\nhave blocked up the lower ends of the fissures.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE OF S. GEORGES, IN THE JURA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best way of reaching this glacière from Geneva would be to take the\r\nsteamer to Rolle, or the train to one of the neighbouring stations,\r\nbetween Geneva and Lausanne, and thence pass up the slope of the Jura by\r\nthe road which leads through Gimel. For the train, the Allaman station\r\nwould be the most convenient, as an omnibus runs from Allaman to\r\nAubonne, where the poste for Gimel may be caught. But from Arzier there\r\nis a short cut of less than two hours along the side of the hills,\r\nleaving that village by a deep gorge not unfitly named _L'Enfer_, and a\r\ndark wood which retains an odour of more savage bygone times in its name\r\nof the 'Bear's Wood,' as containing a cavern where an old bear was\r\ndetected in the act of attempting to winter.[12]\r\n\r\nThe village of S. Georges has very respectable accommodation for a\r\nsingle traveller, _au Cavalier_. The common day-room will be found\r\nuntenable by most Englishmen, however largely they may delight in\r\nrough quarters; but there is a double-bedded room at the end of a\r\nbricked passage up-stairs, which serves well for bedroom and\r\nsitting-room in one. The chief drawback in this arrangement is, that\r\nthe landlady inexorably removes all washing apparatus during the day,\r\nholding that a pitcher and basin are unseemly ornaments for a\r\nsitting-room. The deal table, of course, serves both for dressing and\r\nfor feeding purposes, but it is fortunately so long that an end can be\r\ndevoted to each; and on the whole it is possible to become\r\nconsiderably attached to the room, with its three airy windows, and\r\nthe cool unceasing hum of a babbling fountain in the village-street\r\nbelow. The Auberge is a large building, with a clock-tower of\r\nconsiderable height, containing the clock of the commune: as soon as\r\nthe candle is put out at night, it becomes painfully evident that a\r\nrectangular projection in one corner of the room is in connection with\r\nthis tower, and in fact forms a part of the abode of the pendulum,\r\nwhich plods on with audible vigour, growing more and more audible as\r\nthe hours pass on, and making a stealthy pervading noise, as if a\r\ncouple of lazy ghosts were threshing phantom wheat. The clocks of\r\nVaud, too, are in the habit of striking the hour twice, with a short\r\ninterval; so that if anyone is not sure what the clock meant the first\r\ntime, he has a second chance of counting the strokes. This is no doubt\r\nan admirable plan under ordinary circumstances, but it does certainly\r\ntry the patience of a sleepless dyspeptic after a surfeit of\r\ncafé-au-lait and honey; and when he has counted carefully the first\r\ntime, and is bristling with the consciousness that it is only\r\nmidnight, it is aggravating in the extreme to have the long slow story\r\ntold a second time within a few feet of his head.\r\n\r\nThe Cavalier had retained a guide overnight, Henri Renaud by name, and\r\nhe appeared punctually at eight o'clock in the morning, got up in the\r\nshort-tail coat of the country, and a large green umbrella with mighty\r\nribs of whalebone. The weather was extremely unpleasant, a cold pitiless\r\nrain rendering all attempts at protection unavailing; but, fortunately,\r\nthe glacière is only an hour and a quarter from the village. The path is\r\ntolerably steep, leading across the _petit Pré de Rolle_, and through\r\nwoods of beech and fir, till the summit of one of the minor ridges of\r\nthe Jura is reached, whence a short descent leads to the mouth of the\r\nglacière, something more than 4,000 feet above the sea. The ground here\r\nslopes down towards the north; and on the slope, among fir-trees, an\r\nirregular circular basin is seen, some seven or eight yards across,[13]\r\nand perhaps two yards deep, at the bottom of which are two holes. One of\r\nthese holes is open, and as the guide and I--for my sisters remained at\r\nArzier--stood on the neck of ground between the holes, we could see the\r\nsnow lying at the bottom of the cave; the other is covered with trunks\r\nof trees, laid over the mouth to prevent the rays of the sun from\r\nstriking down on to the ice. This protection has become necessary in\r\nconsequence of an incautious felling of wood in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the mouth, which has exposed the ice to the assaults of\r\nthe weather. The commune has let the glacière for a term of nine years,\r\nreceiving six or seven hundred francs in all; and the _fermier_ extracts\r\nthe ice, and sells it in Geneva and Lausanne. In hot summers, the\r\nsupplies of the artificial ice-houses fail; and then the hotel-keepers\r\nhave recourse to the stores laid up for them by nature in the Glacières\r\nof S. Georges and S. Livres. Hence the importance of protecting the\r\nice; the necessity for so doing arising in this case from the fact that\r\nthe entrance to the cave is by a hole in the roof, which exposes the ice\r\nto direct radiation, unlike all other glacières, excepting perhaps the\r\n_Cueva del Hielo_ on the Peak of Teneriffe.[14]\r\n\r\nAutumn appears to be the usual time for cutting the ice, when it is\r\ncarried from the cave on men's backs as far as the commencement of the\r\nrough mountain-road, and is there packed on chars, and so conveyed to\r\nthe nearest railway station. Renaud had worked in the cave for two\r\nyears, and asserted that they did not choose the night for carrying\r\nthe ice down to the station, and did not even care to choose a cool\r\nday. He believed that, in the autumn of 1863, they loaded two chars a\r\nday for fifteen days, and each char took from 40 to 50 quintaux; the\r\nquintal containing 50 kilos, or 100 livres.[15] In Professor Pictet's\r\ntime (1822) this glacière supplied the Hospital of Geneva, whose\r\nincome depended in part on its privilege of _revente_ of all ice sold\r\nin the town, with 25 quintaux every other day during the summer. In my\r\nanxiety to learn the exact amount of ice now supplied by the glacière,\r\nI determined to find out the _fermier_; but Renaud could tell nothing\r\nof him beyond the fact that he lived in Geneva, which some promiscuous\r\nperson supplemented by the information that his name was Boucqueville,\r\nand that he had something to do with comestibles. On entering upon a\r\nhunt for M. Boucqueville a fortnight later, it turned out that no one\r\nhad heard of such a person, and the Directory professed equal\r\nignorance; but, under the head of 'Comestibles,' there appeared a\r\nGignoux-Bocquet, No. 34, Marché. Thirty-four, Marché, said, yes--M.\r\nBocquet--it was quite true: nevertheless, it was clear that monsieur\r\nmeant Sebastian aîné, on the Molard. The Molard knew only a younger\r\nSebastian, but suggested that the right man was probably M.\r\nGignoux-Chavaz, over the way; and when it was objected that\r\nGignoux-Bocquet, and not Gignoux-Chavaz, was the name, the Molard\r\nreplied that it made no matter,--Chavaz or Bocquet, it was all the\r\nsame. When M. Gignoux-Chavaz was found, he said that he certainly was\r\na man who had something to do with a glacière, but, instead of farming\r\nthe Glacière of S. Georges, he had only bought a considerable quantity\r\nof ice two years ago from the Glacière of S. Livres, and he did not\r\nbelieve that the _fermier_ of S. Georges lived in Geneva. Part of the\r\nconfusion was due to the custom of placing a wife's maiden name after\r\nher husband's name: thus Gignoux-Chavaz implies that a male Gignoux\r\nhas married a female Chavaz; and when a Swiss marries an English lady\r\nwith a very English name, the result in the Continental mouth is\r\nsufficiently curious.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the entrance to the glacière, the end of a suggestive\r\nladder is seen under the protecting trunks; and after one or two steps\r\nhave been taken down the ladder, the effect of the cave below is\r\nextremely remarkable, the main features being a long wall covered\r\nthickly with white ice in sheets, a solid floor of darker-coloured ice,\r\nand a high pyramid of snow reaching up towards the uncovered hole\r\nalready spoken of. The atmosphere of the cave is damp, and this causes\r\nthe ladders to fall speedily to decay, so that they are by no means to\r\nbe trusted: indeed, an early round gave way under one of my sisters,\r\nwhen they visited the cave with me in 1861, and suggested a clear fall\r\nof 60 feet on to a cascade of ice.[16] There are three ladders, one\r\nbelow the other, and a hasty measurement gave their lengths as 20, 16,\r\nand 28 feet. The rock-roof is only a few feet thick in the neighbourhood\r\nof the hole of entrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE GLACIÈRE OF S. GEORGES.]\r\n\r\nThe total length of the cave is 110 feet, lying NE. and SW., in the line\r\nof the main chain of the Jura. The lowest part of the floor is a sea of\r\nice of unknown depth, 45 feet long by 15 broad; and Renaud tried my\r\npowers of belief by asserting that in 1834 the level of this floor was\r\nhigher by half the height of the cave than now; a statement, however,\r\nwhich is fully borne out by Professor Pictet's measurements in 1822,\r\nwhen the depth of the glacière was less than 30 feet. Indeed, the floor\r\nhad sunk considerably since my previous visit, when it was all at the\r\nsame level down to the further end of the cave; whereas now, as will be\r\nseen in the section, there was a platform of stones resting on ice at\r\nthat end. There are two large fissures passing into the rock, one only\r\nof which can be represented in the section, and these were full of white\r\nice, not owing its whiteness apparently to the admixture of air in\r\nbubbles, but firm and compact, and very hard, almost like porcelain.\r\nSmall stalactites hung from round fissures in the roof, formed of the\r\nsame sort of ice, and broken off short, much as the end of a leaden pipe\r\nis sometimes seen to project from a wall. With this exception, there was\r\nno ice hanging from the roof, though there were abundant signs of very\r\nfine columns which had already yielded to the advancing warmth: one of\r\nthese still remained, in the form of broken blocks of ice, in the\r\nneighbourhood of the open hole in the roof, immediately below which hole\r\nthe stones of the floor were completely bare, and the thermometer stood\r\nat 50°. At the far end of the cave, the thermometer gave something less\r\nthan 32°; a difference so remarkable, at the same horizontal level, that\r\nI am inclined to doubt the accuracy of the figures, though they were\r\nregistered on the spot with due care. The uncovered hole, it must be\r\nremembered, is so large, and so completely open, that the rain falls\r\nfreely on to the stones on the floor below.\r\n\r\nBy far the most striking part of this glacière is the north-west\r\nwall, which is covered with a sheet of ice 70 feet long, and 22 feet\r\nhigh at the highest part: in the neighbourhood of the ladders, this\r\nturns the corner of the cave, and passes up for about 9 feet under the\r\nsecond ladder. The general thickness of the sheet is from a foot to a\r\nfoot and a half; and this is the chief source from which the _fermier_\r\ndraws the ice, as it is much more easily quarried than the solid\r\nfloor. Some of my friends went to the cave a few weeks after my visit,\r\nand found that the whole sheet had been pared off and carried away. On\r\nsome parts of the wall the sheet was not completely continuous, being\r\nformed of broad and distinct cascades, connected by cross channels of\r\nice, and uniting at their upper and lower ends, thus presenting many\r\ncurious and ornamental groupings. On cutting through this ice, it was\r\nfound not to lie closely on the rock, a small intermediate space being\r\ngenerally left, almost filled with minute limestone particles in a\r\nvery wet state; and the whole cavern showed signs of more or less\r\nthaw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GLACIÈRE OF S. GEORGES. VERTICAL SECTIONS OF THE\r\nGLACIÈRE OF S. GEORGES.]\r\n\r\nIt was natural to examine the structure of the ice in this glacière,\r\nafter what we had observed on La Genollière. The same prismatic\r\nstructure was universal in the sheet on the wall, and in the blocks\r\nwhich lay here and there on the floor and formed the sole remains of\r\nformer columns. It was to be observed also in many parts of the\r\nice-floor itself. The base of one large column still remained standing\r\nin its original position, and its upper end presented a tolerably\r\naccurate horizontal section of the column. The centre was composed of\r\nturbid ice, round which limpid prisms were horizontally arranged,\r\ndiverging like the feathers of a fan; then came a ring of turbid ice,\r\nand then a second concentric ring of limpid prisms, diverging in the\r\nsame manner as those which formed the inner ring. There were in all\r\nthree or four of these concentric rings, the details showing a\r\nconsiderable amount of confusion and interference: the general law,\r\nhowever, was most evident, and has held in all the similar columns which\r\nI have since examined in other glacières. The rings were not accurately\r\ncircular, but presented rather the appearance of having been formed\r\nround a roughly-fluted pillar on an elliptical base.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the ice on the wall gave some curious results. The\r\nhorizontal arrangement of the prisms, which we had found to prevail in\r\nvertical columns, was here modified to suit the altered conditions of\r\nthe case, and the axes of the prisms changed their inclination so as to\r\nbe always perpendicular to the surface on which the ice lay, as far as\r\ncould be determined by the eye. Thus, in following the many changes of\r\ninclination of the wall, the axes of the prisms stood at many different\r\nangles with the vertical, from a horizontal position where the wall\r\nchanced to be vertical, to a vertical position on the horizontal ledges\r\nof the rock. The extreme edges, too, of the ice, presented a very\r\npeculiar appearance. The general thickness, as has been said, varied\r\nfrom a foot to a foot and a half; and this diminished gradually along\r\nhorizontal lines, till, at the edges of the sheet, where the ice ceased,\r\nit became of course nothing. The extreme edge was formed of globular or\r\nhemispherical beads of ice, like the freezing of a sweating-stone, lying\r\nso loosely on the rock that I could sweep them off in detail with one\r\nhand, and catch them with the other as they fell. Passing farther on\r\ntowards the thicker parts of the ice, these beads stood up higher and\r\nhigher, losing their roundness, and becoming compressed into prisms of\r\nall shapes, in very irregular imitation of the cellular tissue in\r\nplants, the axes of the prisms following the generally-observed law.\r\nThere seems to be nothing in this phenomenon which cannot be accounted\r\nfor by the supposition of gradual thaw of small amount being applied to\r\na sheet of prismatic ice.\r\n\r\nOne fact was remarkable from its universal appearance. Wherever an\r\nincision was made in this sheet of ice, the prisms snapped off at the\r\ndepth of an inch, and could be mowed down like corn by means of a stout\r\nknife. Although they broke naturally at this constant depth, and left a\r\nsurface of limpid ice without any signs of external or internal\r\ndivision, still the laminae obtained by chiselling this lower surface\r\ncarefully, broke up regularly into the shapes to be expected in sections\r\nof prisms cut at right angles to the axis. The roughness of my\r\ninstruments made it impossible to discover how far this extended, and\r\nwhether it ceased to be the case at any given depth in the ice.\r\n\r\nThe sea of ice on the floor was in a very wet state at the surface,\r\nbeing at a lower level than the stones on to which the rain from the\r\nopen hole fell; and here the prismatic structure was not apparent to the\r\neye, nor do I know whether it existed at all. In the Glacière of La\r\nGenollière I carried a large block of perfectly prismatic ice into the\r\nouter cave, where it was exposed to the free currents of air passing\r\nfrom the pit of entrance to the hole newly opened by the falling in of\r\nthe ground; and, two days after, the external lines were scarcely\r\nperceptible, while on the occasion of our third visit I found that they\r\nhad entirely disappeared, and the whole block was rapidly following\r\ntheir example. This disappearance of the surface-lines under the action\r\nof atmospheric thaw is probably the same thing as their absence when the\r\nflooring of ice is thinly covered with water. Wherever the flooring rose\r\nslightly towards the edges of the sea of ice, the usual structure\r\nappeared again.\r\n\r\nThere were no currents of air in the cave, the candles burning steadily\r\nthrough the whole time of our visit. Excepting for the purpose of\r\ndetecting disturbance in the air, there is no need of candles, as the\r\ntwo holes in the roof supply sufficient light. Some account of the\r\ncareful observations made here by M. Thury, at different seasons of the\r\nyear, will be found in other parts of this book. We passed, on our\r\nreturn, by the source of water which springs from the foot of a rock at\r\nsome distance from the glacière, and is supposed to form the outlet for\r\nthe drainage of the cave; but it is difficult to understand how this can\r\nbe the case, considering the form and character of the intervening\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe two ice-caves so far described are the least interesting of all that\r\nI have visited; but a peasant informed me, a day or two after, that if\r\nwe had penetrated to the back of the pyramid of snow which lay half\r\nunder the open hole, being the remains of the large collection which is\r\nformed there in the winter, we might have found a deep pit which is\r\nsometimes exposed by the melting of the snow. He had some idea that its\r\ndepth was 30 feet a few years ago, and that its sides were solid ice. I\r\nshall have occasion to mention such pits in another glacière; if one\r\ndoes exist here, it has probably been quarried in the ice by the drops\r\nfrom the hole in the roof, and there might be some interest attached to\r\nan attempt to investigate it.[17]\r\n\r\nWe reached S. Georges again in a wretched state of wet and cold, and\r\nRenaud went off to bed, and imbibed abundant and super-abundant\r\nkirsch,--at least, when drawn thence the next morning, his manner left\r\nno doubt about either the fact or the abundance of the potations\r\novernight. Warned by many experiences, I had gone no nearer to a\r\nspecification of the bill of fare than a vague suggestion that\r\n_quelque chose_ must be forthcoming, with an additional stipulation\r\nthat this must be something more than mere onions and fat. The\r\nlandlady's rendering of _quelque chose_ was very agreeable, but, for\r\nthe benefit of future diners _au Cavalier_, it is as well to say that\r\nthose who do not like anisette had better make a private arrangement\r\nwith their hostess, otherwise they will swallow with their soup an\r\namount sufficient for many generations of the drag: they may also\r\nsafely order savoury rice, with browned veal and wine-sauce, which is\r\nevidently a strong point with the Cavalier. All meals there are\r\npicturesque; for the omelette lay on the Castle of Grandson and a part\r\nof the Lake of Neufchâtel, while the butter reposed on the ruined\r\nCathedral of Sion, and the honey distilled pleasantly from the comb on\r\nto the walls of Wufflens. No one should put any trust in the spoons,\r\nwhich are constructed apparently of pewter shavings in a chronic state\r\nof semi-fusion. On the evening of the second day, the landlady allowed\r\na second knife at tea, as the knife-of-all-work had begun to knock up\r\nunder the heavy strain upon its powers; but this supplementary\r\ninstrument was of the ornamental kind, and, like other ornamental\r\nthings, broke down at a crisis, which took the form of a piece of\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\nLest this account should raise anyone's expectations too high, it is as\r\nwell to add that they have no snuffers in S. Georges, beyond such as\r\nNature provided when she gave men fingers; and they burn attenuated\r\ntallow candles with full-bodied wicks. Also, the tea is flavoured with\r\nvanille, unless that precious flavouring is omitted by private contract.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: On our previous visit, in 1861, we passed from Arzier\r\nthrough Longirod and Marchissy, stopping to measure and admire the huge\r\nlime-tree in the churchyard of the latter village. Our Swiss companion\r\non that occasion was anxious that we should carry home some ice from the\r\ncave; and as the communal law forbade the removal of the ice by\r\nstrangers, he hunted up a cousin in Marchissy, and sent him with a\r\n_hotte_ across country, while we went innocently by the ordinary route\r\nthrough S. Georges. The cousin, however, contrived to lose himself in\r\nthe woods, and we never heard of him again.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The size of this basin is exaggerated in the engraving on\r\npage 24, owing to the roughness of the original sketch.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: See p. 253.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: For further details on this point see pages 54 and 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: These ladders have at best but little stability, as they\r\nconsist of two uprights, careless about the coincidence of the holes,\r\nwith bars poked loosely through and left to fall out or stay in as they\r\nchoose, the former being the prevailing choice.

LIVRES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had intended to walk on from S. Georges to Bière, after returning from\r\nthe glacière last described, and thence, the next morning, to the Pré de\r\nS. Livres, the mountain pasturage of the commune of S. Livres,[18] a\r\nvillage near Aubonne. But Renaud advised a change of plan, and the\r\nresult showed that his advice was good. He said that the _fermier_ of\r\nthe Glacière of S. Livres generally lived in S. Georges, and, if he were\r\nat home, would be the best guide to the glacière; while the distance\r\nfrom S. Georges was, if anything, rather less than the distance from\r\nBière; so that by remaining at the Cavalier for another night the walk\r\nto Bière would be saved, and the possibility of finding no competent\r\nguide there would be evaded. Jules Mignot, the farmer in question, was\r\nat home, and promised to go to the glacière in the morning, pledging his\r\nword and all that he was worth for the existence and soundness of the\r\nladders; a matter of considerable importance, for M. Thury had been\r\nunable to reach the ice, as also my sisters, by reason of a failure in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evening Mignot came in, and confidentially took the\r\nother chair. He wished to state that he had three _associés_ in working\r\nthe glacière, and that one of them knew of a similar cave, half an hour\r\nfrom the one more generally known; the _associé_ had found it two years\r\nbefore, and had not seen it since, and he believed that no one else knew\r\nwhere it was to be found. If I cared to visit it, the _associé_ would\r\naccompany us, but there was some particular reason--here he relapsed\r\ninto patois--why this other man could not by himself serve as guide to\r\nboth glacières. As this meant that I must have two guides, and suggested\r\nthat perhaps the right rendering of _associé_ was 'accomplice,' the\r\nnegotiation nearly came to a violent end; but the farmer was so\r\nextremely explanatory and convincing, that I gave him another chance,\r\nasking him how much the two meant to have, and telling him that,\r\nalthough I could not see the necessity for two guides, I only wished to\r\ndo what was right. He expressed his conviction of the truth of this\r\nstatement with such fervour, that I could only hope his moderation might\r\nbe as great as his faith. He took the usual five minutes to make up his\r\nmind what to say, going through abstruse calculations with a brow\r\ndemonstratively bent, and, to all appearance, reckoning up exactly what\r\nwas the least it could be done for, consistently with his duty to\r\nhimself and his family. Then he asked, with an air of resignation, as if\r\nhe were throwing himself and his _associé_ away, 'Fifteen francs, then,\r\nwould monsieur consider too much?' 'Certainly, far too much; twelve\r\nfrancs would be enormous. But, for the pleasure of his company and that\r\nof his friend, I should be happy to give that sum for the two, and they\r\nmust feed themselves.' He jumped at the offer, with an alacrity which\r\nshowed that I had much under-estimated his margin in putting it at three\r\nfrancs; and with many expressions of anticipatory gratitude, and\r\npromises of axes and ropes in case of emergency, he bowed himself out.\r\nThe event proved that both the men were really valuable, and they got\r\nsomething over the six francs a-piece.\r\n\r\nThe rain had been steadily increasing in intensity for the last\r\ntwenty-four hours, from the insidious steeping of a Scotch mist to the\r\nviolence of a chronic thunderstorm, and had about reached this crisis\r\nwhen we started in the morning for the Pré de S. Livres. I had already\r\ntested its effects before breakfast, in a search for the Renaud of the\r\nday before, who had made statements regarding the ice at S. Georges, and\r\nthe time of cutting it, which a night's reflection showed to be false.\r\nTo search for Henri Renaud in the village of S. Georges, was something\r\nlike making an enquiry of a certain porter for the rooms of Mr. John\r\nJones. The landlady of the Cavalier was responsible for the first stage\r\nof the journey, asserting that he lived two doors beyond the next\r\nauberge, evidently with a feeling that it was wrong so far to patronise\r\nthe rival house as to live near it. That, however, was not the same\r\nHenri Renaud; and a house a few yards off was recommended as a likely\r\nplace, where, instead of Henri, a Louis Renaud turned up, shivering\r\nunder the eaves in company with the _fermier_, who introduced Louis in\r\ndue form as the accomplice. They received conjointly and submissively a\r\nlecture on the absurdity of calling it a rainy morning, and the\r\nimpossibility of staying at home, even if it came on much worse, and\r\nthen pointed the way to the true Henri Renaud, half-way down the\r\nvillage. When I arrived at the place indicated, and consulted a\r\npromiscuous Swiss as to the abode of the object of my search, he\r\nexclaimed, 'Henri Renaud? I am he.' 'But,' it was objected, 'it is the\r\n_marchand de bois_ who is wanted.' 'Precisely, Henri Renaud, marchand de\r\nbois; it is I.' 'But, it is the cutter of ice in the glacière.' 'Ah, a\r\ndifferent Henri. That Henri is in bed in the house yonder,' and so at\r\nlast he was found. When finally unearthed, Henri confessed that when he\r\nhad said _spring_ the day before, he ought to have said _autumn_, and\r\nthat by autumn he meant November and December. Enquiries elsewhere\r\nshowed that the end of summer was what he really meant, if he meant to\r\ntell the truth.\r\n\r\nOur route for the glacière followed the high road which leads by the\r\nAsile de Marchairuz to La Vallée, as far as the well-known Châlet de la\r\nS. Georges; and then the character of the way changed rapidly for the\r\nworse, and we took to the wet woods. After a time, the wood ceased for a\r\nwhile, and a large expanse of smooth rock showed itself, rising slightly\r\nfrom the horizontal, and so slippery in its present wet condition that\r\nwe could not pass up it. Then woods again, and then the montagnes of\r\n_Sous la Roche_, and _La Foireuse_, till at last, in two hours, the Pré\r\nde S. Livres was achieved. The fog was so dense that nothing could be\r\nseen of the general lie of the country; but the _thalweg_ was a\r\nsufficient guide, and after due perseverance we came upon the glacière,\r\nnot many yards from that line, on the north slope of the open valley,\r\nabout 4,500 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nTo prevent cattle from falling into the pit, a wall has been built round\r\nthe trees in which it lies. The circumference of this wall is 435 feet,\r\nbut there are so many trees at the upper end of the enclosure that this\r\ngives an exaggerated idea of the size of the pit. The men fed while the\r\npreliminary measurements were being made; and when this was\r\naccomplished, they pressed their bottle of wine upon me so hospitably\r\nthat I was obliged to antedate the result which its appearance promised,\r\nand plead _mal d'estomac_. Of all things, it is most unwise to give a\r\nreason for a negative, and so it proved in this instance; for they\r\npromptly felicitated themselves and me on the good luck by which it\r\nhappened that they had brought a wine famous on all the côte as a remedy\r\nfor that somewhat vague complaint--a homoeopathic remedy in allopathic\r\ndoses.\r\n\r\nThe glacière is entered by a natural pit in the gentle slope of grass,\r\nnot much unlike the pit of La Genollière, but wider, and covered at\r\nthe bottom with snow.[19] The first ladder leads down to a ledge of\r\nrock on which bushes and trees grow, and this ledge it is possible to\r\nreach without a ladder; the next ladder leads on to the deep snow, and\r\ndescent by any ordinary manner of climbing is in this case quite\r\nimpossible.[20] The snow slopes down towards a lofty arch in the rock\r\nwhich forms the north-west side of the pit, and this arch is the\r\nentrance to the glacière; it is 28-3/4 feet wide, and as soon as we\r\npassed under it we found that the snow became ice, and it was\r\nnecessary to cut steps; for the surface of underground ice is so\r\nslippery, unlike the surface of ordinary glaciers, that the slightest\r\ndefect from the horizontal makes the use of the axe advisable. The\r\nstream of ice falls gradually, spreading out laterally like a fan, so\r\nas to accommodate itself to the shape of the cave, which it fills up\r\nto the side walls; it increases in breadth from 28-3/4 feet at the top\r\nto 72 feet at the bottom of the slope, and the distance from the top\r\nof the first ladder to this point is 177 feet. Here we were arrested\r\nby a strange wall of ice 22 feet high, down which there seemed at\r\nfirst no means of passing; but finding an old ladder frozen into a\r\npart of the wall, we chopped out holes between the upper steps, and so\r\ndescended, landing on a flooring composed of broken blocks and columns\r\nof ice, with a certain amount of what seemed to be drifted snow. This\r\nwall of ice, which was 72 feet long and 22 feet high, was not\r\nvertical, but sloped the wrong way, caving in under the stream of ice;\r\nand from the projecting top of the wall a long fringe of vast icicles\r\nhung down, along the whole breadth of the fan. The effect of this was,\r\nthat we could walk between the ice-wall and the icicles as in a\r\ncloister, with solid ice on the one hand and Gothic arcades of ice on\r\nthe other, the floor being likewise of ice, and the roof formed by the\r\njunction of the wall with the top of the icicle-arcade. The floor of\r\nthis cloister was not 22 feet below the top of the wall, for it formed\r\nthe upper part of a gentle descending slope of ice, rounded off like a\r\nfall of water, which seemed to flow from the lower part of the wall;\r\nand the height of 22 feet is reckoned from the foot of this slope,\r\nwhich terminated at a few feet of horizontal distance from the foot of\r\nthe wall. The wall of ice was plainly marked with horizontal bands,\r\ncorresponding, no doubt, to a number of years of successive deposits;\r\nsometimes a few leaves, but more generally a strip of minuter débris,\r\nsignified the divisions between the annual layers. There had been many\r\ncolumns of ice from fissures in the rock, but all had fallen except\r\none large ice-cascade, which flowed from a hole in the side of the\r\ncave on to the main stream, about two-thirds of the distance down from\r\nthe snow. One particularly grand column had stood on the very edge of\r\nthe ice-wall, and its remains now lay below.\r\n\r\nThe flooring of mingled ice and snow, on which we stood, sloped through\r\nabout five vertical feet from the foot of the wall, and came to an end\r\non broken rocks, from which the terminal wall of the cave sprang up. The\r\neffect of the view from this point, as we looked up the long slope of\r\nice to where the ladders and a small piece of sky were visible, was most\r\nstriking. The accompanying engraving is from a sketch which attempts to\r\nrepresent it; the reality is much less prim, and much more full of\r\nbeautiful detail, but still the engraving gives a fair idea of the\r\ngeneral appearance of the cave.\r\n\r\nWhile I was occupied in making sketches and measurements, Mignot was\r\nengaged in chopping discontentedly at the floor, in two or three\r\ndifferent places. At length he seemed to find a place to his mind, and\r\nchopped perseveringly till his axe went through, and then he suggested\r\nthat we should follow. The hole was not tempting. It opened into the\r\nblackest possible darkness, and Mignot thrust his legs through,\r\nfeeling for a foothold, which, by lowering himself almost to his\r\narmpits, he soon discovered: the foothold, however, proved to be a\r\nloose stone, which gave way under him and bounded down, apparently\r\nover an incline of like stones, to a distance which sounded very\r\nalarming. But he would not give in, and at length, descending still\r\nfurther by means of the snow in which the hole was made, he was\r\nrewarded by finding a solid block which bore his weight, and he\r\nspeedily disappeared altogether, summoning me to follow. I proposed to\r\nlight a candle first, not caring to go through such a hole, in such a\r\nfloor, into no one knew what; but he was so very peremptory, evidently\r\nthinking that if he had gone through without a pioneering candle his\r\nmonsieur might do the same, that there was nothing for it but to obey.\r\nThe hole was very near the junction of the floor with the slope of\r\nstones where the floor terminated, and the space between the hole and\r\nthe slope seemed to be filled up with a confused mass of snow and ice,\r\nin which the snow largely predominated; so that there was good hold\r\nfor hands and feet in passing down to the stones, which might be about\r\n7 feet below the upper surface of the floor. Here we crouched in the\r\ndarkness, with our faces turned away from the presumed slope of\r\nstones, till a light was struck. The accomplice did not find it in the\r\nbond that he should go down, and he preferred to reserve his energies\r\nfor his own peculiar glacière.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOWER GLACIÈRE OF THE PRÉ DE S. LIVRES.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the candle had mastered a portion of the darkness, we found\r\nthat we were squatting on a steeply sloping descent of large blocks of\r\nstone, while in face of us was a magnificent wall of ice, evidently the\r\ncontinuation of the wall above, marked most plainly with horizontal\r\nlines. This wall passed down vertically to join the slope on which we\r\nwere, at a depth below our feet which the light of the candle had not\r\nyet fathomed. The horizontal bands were so clear, that, if we had\r\npossessed climbing apparatus, we could have counted the number of layers\r\nwith accuracy. Of course we scrambled down the stones, and found after a\r\ntime that the angle formed by the ice-wall and the slope of stones was\r\nchoked up at the bottom by large pieces of rock, one piled on another\r\njust as they had fallen from the higher parts. These blocks were so\r\nlarge, that we were able to get down among the interstices, in a spiral\r\nmanner, for some little distance; and when we were finally stopped,\r\nstill the ice-wall passed on below our feet, and there was no possible\r\nchance of determining to what depth it went. The atmosphere at this\r\npoint was a sort of frozen vapour, most unpleasant in all respects, and\r\nthe candles burned very dimly. The thermometer stood at 32°, half-way\r\ndown the slope of stones.\r\n\r\nWe were able to stretch a string in a straight line from the lowest\r\npoint we reached, through the interstices of the blocks of stone, and\r\nup to the entrance-hole, and this measurement gave 50 feet.\r\nConsidering the inclination of the upper ice-floor, and the sharpness\r\nof the angle between the wall of ice and the line of our descent to\r\nthis lowest point, I believe that 50 feet will fairly represent the\r\nheight of the ice-wall from this point to the foot of the slope from\r\nthe upper wall; so that 72 feet will be the whole depth of ice, from\r\nthe top of the third ladder to the point where our further progress\r\ndownwards was arrested. The correctness of this calculation depends\r\nupon the honesty of Mignot, who had charge of the farther end of the\r\nstring, and was proud of the wonders of his cave. A dishonest man\r\nmight easily, under the circumstances, have pulled up a few feet more\r\nof string than was necessary, but 50 feet seemed in no way an\r\nimprobable result of the measurement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF THE LOWER GLACIÈRE OF THE PRÉ DE S. LIVRES.]\r\n\r\nThe ice was as solid and firm as can well be conceived. The horizontal\r\nbands would seem to prove conclusively that it was no coating of greater\r\nor less thickness on the face of a vertical wall of rock, an idea which\r\nmight suggest itself to anyone who had not seen it, and I think it\r\nprobable that the amount of ice represented in the section of the cave\r\nis not an exaggeration. We were unable to measure the whole length of\r\nthe wall in the lower cave, from the large number of blocks of stone\r\nwhich had fallen at one end, and lay against its face. Probably, from\r\nthe nature of the case, it was not so long as the 72 feet of wall above;\r\nbut we measured 50 feet, and could see it still passing on to the right\r\nhand as we faced it. In trying to penetrate farther along the face, I\r\nfound a wing of the brown fly we had seen in considerable abundance on\r\nthe ice in La Genollière, frozen into the remains of a column.\r\n\r\nThere was so very much to be observed on all sides, and the measurements\r\ntook up so much time, owing to the peculiar difficulties which attended\r\nthem, that I did not examine with sufficient care the curious floor of\r\nice through which we cut our way to the lower cavern. Neither did I\r\nnotice the roof of the cavern thus reached, which may be very different\r\nfrom the shape of the upper surface of the floor composing it. If the\r\nice-wall goes straight up, and the roof is formed of the ice-floor\r\nalone, then it is a very remarkable feature indeed. But, more probably,\r\nthe lower wall leans over more and more towards the top, and so forms as\r\nit were a part of the roof. It is possible that, as the wall has grown,\r\neach successive annual layer has projected farther and farther, till at\r\nlast some year very favourable to the increase of ice has carried the\r\nprojection for that year nearly to the opposite stones, and then an\r\nunfavourable year or two would form the foot of the upper wall. This\r\nseems more probable, from the loose constitution of the floor at the\r\npoint where it joins the stones, as if it were there only made up of\r\ndrift and débris, while the part of the floor nearer the foot of the\r\nwall is solid ice. It has been suggested to me that possibly water\r\naccumulates in the time of greatest thaw to a very large extent in the\r\nlower parts of the cave, and the ice-floor is formed where the frost\r\nfirst takes hold of this water. But the slope of the ice-floor is\r\nagainst this theory, to a certain extent; and the amount of water\r\nnecessary to fill the cavity would be so enormous, that it is contrary\r\nto all experience to imagine such a collection, especially as the cave\r\nshowed no signs of present thaw. The appearance of the rocks, too, in\r\nthe lower cave, and the surface of the ice-wall there, gave no\r\nindications of the action of water; and there was no trace of ice among\r\nthe stones, as there certainly would have been if water had filled the\r\ncave, and gradually retired before the attacks of frost, or in\r\nconsequence of the opening up of drainage. There were pieces of the\r\ntrunks of trees, also, and large bones, lying about at different levels\r\non the rocks. I never searched for bones in these caves, owing to the\r\nabsence of the stalagmitic covering which preserves cavern-bones from\r\ndecay; nor did I take any notice of such as presented themselves without\r\nsearch, for the _bergers_ are in the habit of throwing the carcases of\r\ndeceased cows into any deep hole in the neighbourhood of the place where\r\nthe carcases may be found, in consequence of the general belief that\r\nliving cows go mad if they find the grave of a companion; so that I\r\nshould probably have made a laborious collection of the bones of the\r\n_bos domesticus_. This belief of the bergers respecting the cows is\r\nsupported by several circumstantial and apparently trustworthy accounts\r\nof fearful fights among herds of cattle over the grave of some of the\r\nherd. The sight of a companion's blood is said to have a similar effect\r\nupon them. Thus a small pasturage between Anzeindaz and the Col de\r\nCheville, on the border of the cantons Vaud and Valais, is still called\r\n_Boulaire_ from legendary times, when the herdsmen of Vaud (then Berne)\r\nwon back from certain Valaisan thieves the cattle the latter were\r\ncarrying off from La Varraz. Some of the cows were wounded in the\r\nbattle, and the sight of their blood drove the others mad, so that they\r\nfought till almost all the herd was destroyed; whence the name\r\nBoulaire, from _ébouëler_, to disembowel,--a word formed from _bouë_,\r\nthe patois for _boyau_.\r\n\r\nWhen we left the lower darkness and ascended to the floor of ice once\r\nmore, Mignot expressed a desire to see my attempt at a sketch of the\r\nglacière from that point, as he had been much struck during his\r\nnegotiatory visit of the night before by the sketch of the entrance to\r\nthe Glacière of S. Georges, chiefly because he had guessed what it was\r\nmeant for. He was evidently disappointed with the representation of his\r\nown cave, for he could see nothing but a network of lines, with\r\nunintelligible words written here and there, and after some hesitation\r\nhe confessed that it was not the least like it. A little explanation\r\nsoon set that right, and then he began to plead vigorously for the wall\r\nwhich surrounded the trees at the mouth of the pit. Why was it not put\r\nin? He was told, because it could not be seen from below; but\r\nnevertheless he strongly urged its introduction, on the ground that he\r\nhad built it himself, and it was such a well-built wall; facts which far\r\nmore than balanced any little impossibility that might otherwise have\r\nprevented its appearance. After we had reached the grass of the outer\r\nworld again, he made me sketch the entrance to the pit, pointing to the\r\ncontaining wall with parental pride, and standing over the sketch-book\r\nand the sketcher with an umbrella which speedily turned inside out\r\nunder the combined pressure of wind, and rain, and years; a feat which\r\nit had already performed _des fois_, he said, in the course of his\r\nacquaintance with it.\r\n\r\nBefore finally leaving the glacière, I examined the structure of the\r\ngreat stream of ice, at different points near the top of the limiting\r\nwall. From its outward appearance it might have been expected to be\r\nrough, but it was not so; it was knotty to the eye, but perfectly smooth\r\nto the foot, and, when cut, showed itself perfectly clear and limpid. It\r\ndid not separate under the axe into misshapen pieces, with faces of\r\nevery possible variation from regularity, that is, with what is called\r\nvitreous fracture, but rather separated into a number of nuts of limpid\r\nice, each being of a prismatic form, and of much regularity in shape and\r\nsize. It was smooth, dark-grey, and clear; free from air, and free from\r\nsurface lines; very hard, and suggesting the idea of coarse internal\r\ngranulation. In the large ice-streams of some darker glacières, this ice\r\nassumed a rather lighter colour by candle-light, but always presented\r\nthe same granular appearance, and cut up into the same prismatic nuts,\r\nand was evidently free from constitutional opacity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _Sancti Liberii locus_, the Swiss Dryasdust explains.\r\nThere is nothing to connect any known S. Liberius with this\r\nneighbourhood, unless it be the Armenian prince who secretly left his\r\nfather's court for Jerusalem, and was sought for throughout Burgundy and\r\nother countries. It seems that Saint Oliver is merely a corruption of S.\r\nLiberius, the Italian form of the latter, Santo Liverio, having become\r\nSant-Oliverio, as S. Otho became in another country Sant Odo, and thence\r\nSan Todo, thus creating a new Saint, S. Todus.--Act SS. May 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: My sisters made a two-days' excursion from Arzier to this\r\nglacière in the autumn of 1862, and found no snow in the bottom of the\r\npit. They took the route by Gimel to Bière, intending to defer the visit\r\nto the glacière to the morning of the second day; but being warned by\r\nthe appearance known locally as _le sappeur qui fume_, a vaporous cloud\r\nat the mouth of a cavern near the Dent d'Oche, on the other side of the\r\nLake of Geneva, they caught the communal forester at once, and put\r\nthemselves under his guidance. The distance from Bière is two hours'\r\ngood walking, and an hour and a half for the return. There was no ladder\r\nfor the final descent, and the neighbouring châlet could provide nothing\r\nlonger than 15 feet, the drop being 30 feet. Two Frenchmen had attempted\r\nto make their way to the cave a week before; but the old 30-foot ladder\r\nof the previous year broke under the foremost of them, and he fell into\r\nthe pit, whence he was drawn up by means of a cord composed of\r\nrack-ropes from the châlet, tied together. However useful a string of\r\ncow-ties may be for rescuing a man from such a situation, A. and M. did\r\nnot care to make use of that apparatus for a voluntary descent, so they\r\nwere perforce contented with a distant view of the ice from the lower\r\nedge of the pit.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: See the section of this cave and pit on page 41.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE UPPER GLACIÈRE OF THE PRÉ DE S. LIVRES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now put ourselves under the guidance of the accomplice, Louis, who\r\nbegan to express doubts of his ability to find the upper glacière,\r\nadministering consolation by reminding us that if he could not find it\r\nno one else could.\r\n\r\nAs we walked on through the mist and rain, it became necessary to\r\ncircumvent a fierce-looking bull, and Mignot and the accomplice told\r\nrival tales of the dangers to which pedestrians are exposed from the\r\nviolence of the cattle on some montagnes, where the bulls are allowed\r\nto grow to full size and fierceness. Mignot was quite motherly in his\r\nadvice and his cautions, recommending as the surest safeguard a\r\npocket-pistol, loaded with powder only, to be flashed in the bull's\r\nface as he makes his charge. When informed that in England an umbrella\r\nor a parasol is found to answer this purpose, he shook his head\r\nnegatively, evidently having no confidence in his own umbrella, and\r\ndoubting its obeying his wishes at the critical moment; indeed, it\r\nwould require a considerable time, and much care and labour, to unfurl\r\na lumbering instrument of that description. He had the best of the\r\ntale-contest with Renaud in the end, for he had himself been grazed by\r\na bull which came up with him at the moment when he sprang into a\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nBefore very long we reached a little kennel-like hut of boughs, which no\r\ndecent dog would have lived in, and no large dog could have entered, and\r\nfrom this we drew a charcoal-burner. No, he said, he did not know the\r\nglacière; he had heard that one had been discovered near there, and he\r\nhad spent hours in searching for it without success. A herdsman on his\r\nway from one pasturage to another could give no better help, and we\r\nbegan to despair, till at length Louis desired us to halt in a place\r\nsheltered from the rain, while he prosecuted the search alone. We had\r\nabundant time for observing that, like other leafy places sheltered from\r\nthe rain, our resting-place was commanded by huge and frequent drops of\r\nwater; but at last a joyful _Jodel_ announced the success of the\r\naccomplice, and we ran off to join him.\r\n\r\nAt first sight there was very little to see. Louis had lately been\r\nenunciating an opinion that the cave was not worth visiting, and I now\r\nfelt inclined to agree with him. The general plan appeared to be much\r\nthe same as in the one we had just left, but the scale was\r\nconsiderably smaller. The pit was not nearly so deep or so large, and,\r\nowing to the falling-in of rock and earth at one side, the snow was\r\napproached by a winding path with a gradual fall. As soon as the snow\r\nwas reached, the slope became very steep, and led promptly to an arch\r\nin the rock, where the stream of ice began. The cave being shallow,\r\nthe stream soon came to an end, and, unlike that in the lower\r\nglacière, it filled the cave down to the terminal wall, and did not\r\nfill it up to the left wall. Here the ground of the cave was visible,\r\nstrewn with the remains of columns, and showing the thickness of the\r\nbottom of the stream to be about 6 feet only. The arch of entrance had\r\nevidently been almost closed by a succession of large columns, but\r\nthese had succumbed to the rain and heat to which they had been\r\nexposed by their position.\r\n\r\nThe left side of the cave, in descending, that is the west side, was\r\ncomparatively light, being in the line from the arch; but the other side\r\nwas quite dark, and after a time we found that the ice-stream, instead\r\nof terminating as we had supposed with the wall of rock at the end of\r\nthe cavern, turned off to the right, and was lost in the darkness. Of\r\ncourse candles were brought out, though Louis assured us that he had\r\nexplored this part of the cave on his previous visit, and had found that\r\nthe right wall of the cave very soon stopped the stream: we, on the\r\ncontrary, by tying a candle to a long stick, and thrusting it down the\r\nslope of ice, found that the stream passed down extremely steeply, and\r\npoured under a narrow and low arch in the wall of the cave, beyond\r\nwhich nothing could be seen. We despatched pieces of ice along the\r\nslope, and could hear them whizzing on after they had passed the arch,\r\nand landing apparently on stones far below; so I called for the cords,\r\nand told Louis that we must cut our way down. But, alas! the cords had\r\nbeen left at the other glacière! One long bag, with a hole in the middle\r\nlike an old-fashioned purse, had carried the luncheon at one end and the\r\nropes at the other; and when the luncheon was finished, the bag had been\r\nstowed away under safe trees till our return. This was of course\r\nimmensely annoying, and I rang the changes on the few words of abuse\r\nwhich invention or knowledge supplied, as we sat damp and shivering on\r\nthe verge of the slope, idly sending down pieces of broken columns which\r\nbrought forth tantalising sounds from the subterranean regions. At\r\nlength Renaud was moved to shame, and declared that he would cut his way\r\ndown, rope or no rope; but this seemed so horribly hazardous a\r\nproceeding under all the circumstances, that I forbad his attempting it.\r\nSeeing, however, that he was determined to do something, we arranged\r\nourselves into an apparatus something like a sliding telescope. Louis\r\ncut a first step down the slope, and there took his stand till such time\r\nas Mignot got a firm grasp of the tail of his blouse with both hands, I\r\nmeanwhile holding Mignot's tail with one hand, and the long stick with\r\nthe candle attached to it with the other; thus professedly supporting\r\nthe whole apparatus, and giving the necessary light for the work. Even\r\nso, we tried again to persuade Renaud to give it up, but he was warmed\r\nto his work, and really the arrangement answered remarkably well: when\r\nhe wished to descend to a new step, Mignot let out a little blouse, and,\r\nbeing himself similarly relieved, descended likewise a step, and then\r\nthe remaining link of the chain followed. The leader slipped once, but\r\nfortunately grasped a projecting piece of rock, for the stream was here\r\nconfined within narrow walls, and so the strength of the apparatus was\r\nnot tested; it could scarcely have stood any serious call upon its\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable period of very slow progress, Renaud asked for the\r\ncandlestick, never more literally a stick than now, and thrust it under\r\nthe arch, stooping down so as to see what the farther darkness might\r\ncontain. We above could see nothing, but, after an anxious pause, he\r\ncried _On peut aller!_ with a lively satisfaction so completely shared\r\nby Mignot, that that worthy person was on the point of letting Renaud's\r\nblouse go, in order to indulge in gestures of delight. The step-cutting\r\nwent on merrily after this announcement, and one by one we came to the\r\narch and passed through, finding it rather a trough than an arch; the\r\nbreadth was about 4 feet, and the height from 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 feet, and,\r\nas we pushed through, our breasts were pressed on to the ice, while our\r\nbacks scraped against the rock which formed the roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECOND CAVE OF THE UPPER GLACIÈRE OF THE PRÉ DE S.\r\nLIVRES.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as this trough was passed, the ice spread out like a fan, and\r\nfinally landed us in a subterranean cavern, 72 feet long by 36 feet broad,\r\nto which this was the only entrance. The breadth of the fan at the\r\nbottom was 27 feet; and near the archway a very striking column poured\r\nfrom a vertical fissure in the wall, and joined the main stream. The\r\nfissure was partially open to the cave, and showed the solid round\r\ncolumn within the rock: this column measured 18-1/2 feet in\r\ncircumference, a little below the point where it became free of the\r\nfissure, and it had a stream of ice 22 feet long pouring from its base.\r\nThe colour of the column was unusual, being a dull yellowish green, and\r\nthe peculiar structure of the ice gave the whole mass the appearance of\r\ncoursing down very rapidly, as if the water had been frozen while thus\r\nmoving, and had not therefore ceased so to move. At the bottom of the\r\nfan, the flooring of the cave consisted of broken stones for a small\r\nspace, and then came a black lake of ice, which occupied all the centre\r\nof the cave, and afforded us no opportunity of even guessing at its\r\ndepth. From the manner, however, in which it blended with the stones at\r\nits edge, I am not inclined to believe that this depth was anything very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nRenaud, in his impetuosity, had ceased to cut steps towards the bottom\r\nof the slope, and had slipped down the last few feet, of course cutting\r\nthe remaining steps before attempting to reascend. We found him\r\nstrutting about the floor of the cave, tossing his wet cap in the air,\r\nand crying _No one! No one! I the first!_, declining to take any part in\r\nmeasurements until the full of his delight and pride had been poured\r\nout. He shouted so loud that I was obliged to stop him, lest by some\r\nchance the unwonted disturbance of the air should bring down an unstable\r\nblock from the roof of the arch, and seal us up for ever. There was no\r\nsign of incipient thaw in the cave, and the air was very dry, so much so\r\nas at once to call attention to the fact. At the farthest end, a lofty\r\ndome opened up in the roof; and possibly at some time or other the rock\r\nmay here fall through, and afford another means of entrance. Beneath\r\nthis dome a very lovely cluster of columns had grouped itself, formed of\r\nthe clear porcelain-like ice, and fretted and festooned with the utmost\r\ndelicacy, as if Andersen's Ice Maiden had been there in one of her\r\namiable moods, and had built herself a palace. This dome in the roof was\r\nsimilar to many which I afterwards observed in other glacières, being a\r\nvertical fissure with flutings from top to bottom--not a spherical dome,\r\nbut of that more elegant shape which the female dress of modern times\r\nassumes on a tall person.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERTICAL SECTIONS OF THE UPPER GLACIÈRE OF THE PRÉ DE S.\r\nLIVRES. [21]]\r\n\r\nBetween the base of the circular column and the wall, we found a rare\r\ninstance of clear jelly-like ice, without any lines external or\r\ninternal, such as is formed in the open air under very favourable\r\ncircumstances. The ordinary number of undergraduate May Terms had\r\nafforded various opportunities for studying the comparative clearness of\r\ndifferent pieces of ice, but certainly no one ever saw a lemon pippin\r\nthrough an inch and a half of that material so clearly as we now saw the\r\nwhite rock through 1-1/2 feet. Mignot, indeed, said 2 feet; but it was\r\nhis way to make a large estimate of dimensions, and he constantly\r\ninterrupted my record of measurements by the assertion that I had made\r\nthem _moins que plus_. We were all disappointed by the actual size of\r\nthe ice-fall which it had cost us so much time and trouble to descend,\r\nthe distance from the first step to the last being only 26 feet: as\r\nthis, however, was given by a string stretched from the one point to the\r\nother, and not following the concave surface of the ice, the real\r\ndistance was something more than this.\r\n\r\nIt was now getting rather late, considering the journey one of us had\r\nyet to perform, and we walked quickly away from the glacière, agreeing\r\nthat it was not improbable that in that part of the Jura there might be\r\nmany hidden caves containing more or less ice, with no entrance from the\r\nworld outside, except the fissures which afford a way for the water. The\r\nentrance to this cave was so small, that the same physical effect might\r\nwell be produced by one or two cracks in the rock, such as every one is\r\nwell acquainted with who has walked on the fissured limestone summits\r\nof the lower mountains; and, indeed, Renaud positively affirmed that at\r\nthe time of his former visit there was not even this entrance to the\r\nlower cave, for the ice-stream reached then a higher point of the wall,\r\nand completely filled and hid the arch we had discovered. It is very\r\ndifficult to see how ice can exist in a cave which has no atmospheric\r\ncommunication with the colds of winter, as would apparently be the case\r\nwith this cave if the one entrance were closed; but where the cracks and\r\nsmall fissures in the rock do provide such communication, there is no\r\nreason why we should not imagine all manner of glacial beauties\r\ndecorating unknown cavities, beyond the general physical law to which\r\nall the glacières would seem to be exceptions.\r\n\r\nMignot now became communicative as to the amount of ice supplied by his\r\nglacière, the lower of the two we had seen; and his statistics were so\r\nutterly confused, that I gave him ten centimes and an address, and\r\ncharged him to write it all down from his account-book, and send it by\r\npost. The letter was accordingly written on July 24, and after trying\r\nmany unsuccessful addresses in various parts of Switzerland, it finally\r\nreached England in the middle of September. It tells its own tale\r\nsufficiently well, and is therefore given here with all the mistakes of\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\n'Mon cher Monsieur Browne,--J'ai beaucoup tardé a vous écrire les\r\ndétails promis, sans doute je ne voulait pas vous oublier; nous sommes\r\naffligés dans nôtre maison ma femme et gravement malade ce qui me donne\r\nbeaucoup de tourment jour et nuit, enfin ce n'est pas ce qui doit faire\r\nnôtre entretient.\r\n\r\nEn 1863.

Vous\r\nnoublierez pas ce que vous mavez promis'[22]St. Georges, le 24 Juillet,\r\n1864. _Dimanche_.\r\n\r\n'JULES MIGNOT.'\r\n\r\nInstead of three francs the quintal, Mignot had previously told me that\r\nhe got four francs, delivered at Gland, and five at Geneva. His ordinary\r\nstaff during the time of the exploitation was ten men to carry and load,\r\nand two to cut the ice in the cave.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of considerable importance to catch the Poste at\r\nGimel, and the two Swiss groaned loudly on the consequent pace,\r\nunnecessary, as far as they were concerned, for the Poste was nothing\r\nto them. As a general rule, the Swiss of this district cannot walk so\r\nfast as their Burgundian or French neighbours, unless it is very much\r\nto their interest to do so, and then they can go fast enough. A legend\r\nis still preserved in the valleys of Joux and Les Rousses, to the\r\nfollowing effect. While the Franche Comté was still Spanish, in 1648,\r\ncommissioners were appointed to fix the boundaries between Berne and\r\nBurgundy, on the other side of the range of hill we were now\r\ndescending, and they decided that one of the boundary stones must be\r\nplaced at the distance of a common league from the Lake of Les\r\nRousses. Unfortunately, no one could say what a common league was,\r\nbeyond the vague definition of 'an hour's walk;' so two men were\r\nstarted from the shore of the lake, the one a Burgundian and the other\r\na Swiss, with directions to walk for an hour down the Orbe towards\r\nChenit, the stone to be placed half-way between the points they should\r\nrespectively reach at the end of the hour. It was for the interest of\r\nthe Franche Comté that the stone should be as near the lake as\r\npossible, and accordingly the Swiss champion made such walking as had\r\nnever been seen before, and gained for Berne a considerable amount of\r\nterritory. There was no such tragic result in this case as that which\r\ninduced the Carthaginians to pay divine honours to the brothers whose\r\nspeed, on a like occasion, had added an appreciable amount to the\r\npossessions of the republic.\r\n\r\nAt length we reached the point where the roads for Gimel and S.\r\nGeorges separate, and there, under a glorious sapin, we said our\r\nadieux, and wished our _au revoirs_, and settled those little matters\r\nwhich the best friends must settle, when one is of the nature of a\r\nmonsieur, and the others are guides. They burdened their souls with\r\nmany politenesses, and so we parted. The inclemency of the weather was\r\nsuch, that the people in the lower country asked, as they passed,\r\nwhether snow had fallen in the mountains, and the cold rain continued\r\nunceasingly down to the large plain on which the Federal Camp of\r\nBière[23] is placed. Here for a few moments the sun showed itself,\r\nlighting up the white tents, and displaying to great advantage the\r\nmasses of scented orchises, and the feathery _reine-des-prés_, which\r\nhemmed the road in on either side. All through the earlier part of the\r\nday, flowers had forced themselves upon our notice as mere vehicles\r\nfor collected rain, when we came in contact with them; but now, for a\r\nshort time, they resumed their proper place,--only for a short time,\r\nfor the rain soon returned, and did not cease till midnight. Not all\r\nthe garden scenery about Aubonne and Allaman (_ad Lemannum_), nor all\r\nthe vineyards which yield the choice white wine of the Côte, could\r\ncounterbalance the united discomfort of the rain, and the cold which\r\nhad got into the system in the two glacières; and matters were not\r\nmended by the discovery that _Bradshaw_ was treacherous, and that a\r\njunction with dry baggage at Neufchâtel could not be effected before\r\neleven at night.\r\n\r\nThere are some curious natural phenomena in this neighbourhood, due to\r\nthe subterranean courses which the fissured limestone of the Jura\r\naffords to the meteoric waters. Not far from Bière, the river Aubonne\r\nsprings out at the bottom of an amphitheatre of rock, receiving\r\nadditions soon after from a group of twenty natural pits, which the\r\npeasants call unfathomable--an epithet freely applied to the strange\r\nholes found in the Jura. It is remarkable that the way seems to stand\r\nat different levels in the various pits.[24] The plain of Champagne,\r\nin which they occur, is unlike the surrounding soil in being formed of\r\ncalcareous detritus, evidently brought down by some means or other\r\nfrom the Jura, and is dry and parched up to the very edges of the\r\npits. The Toleure, a tributary of the Aubonne, frequently large enough\r\nto be called a confluent, flows out from the foot of a wall of rock\r\ncomposed of regular parallelopipeds, and in the spring, when the snows\r\nare melting freely, its sources burst out at various levels of the\r\nrock. Farther to the west, the Versoie, famous for its trout, pours\r\nforth a full-sized stream near the Château of Divonne, which is said\r\nto take its name (_Divorum unda_) from this phenomenon. Passing to the\r\nnorthern slope of this range of the Jura, the Orbe is a remarkable\r\nexample of the same sort of thing, flowing out peacefully in very\r\nconsiderable bulk from an arch at the bottom of a perpendicular rock\r\nof great height. This river no doubt owes its origin to the\r\nsuperfluous waters of the Lake of Brenets, which have no visible\r\noutlet, and sink into fissures and _entonnoirs_ in the rock at the\r\nedge of the lake. Notwithstanding that the lake is three-quarters of a\r\nleague distant, horizontally, and nearly 700 feet higher, the belief\r\nhad always been that it was the source of the stream, and in 1776 this\r\nwas proved to be the fact. For some years before that date, the waters\r\nof the Lake of Joux had been inconveniently high, and the people\r\ndetermined to clean out the _entonnoirs_ and fissures of the Lake of\r\nBrenets, which is only separated from the Lake of Joux by a narrow\r\ntongue of land, in the expectation that the water would then pass away\r\nmore freely. In order to reach the fissures, they dammed up the outlet\r\nof the upper into the lower lake; but the pressure on the embankment\r\nbecame too great, and the waters burst through with much violence,\r\ncreating an immense disturbance in the lake; and the Orbe, which had\r\nalways been perfectly clear, was troubled and muddy for some little\r\ntime. The source of the Loue, near Pontarlier, is more striking than\r\neven that of the Orbe.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: A point common to the two sections, which are made by\r\nplanes nearly at right angles to each other.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: The dimensions of the two caves, and of the various masses\r\nof ice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The Cartulary of Lausanne states that the wealthy village\r\nof Bière received its name from the following historical fact:--In 522,\r\nthe Bishop of Lausanne, S. Prothais, was superintending the cutting of\r\nwood in the Jura for his cathedral, when he died suddenly, and was\r\ncarried down on a litter to a place where a proper _bier_ could he\r\nprocured, whence the place was named Bière.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: The most curious pit of this kind is the _frais-puits_ of\r\nVesoul, in the Vosgian Jura, which pours forth immense quantities of\r\nwater after rain has fallen in the neighbourhood. The water rushes out\r\nin the shape of a fountain, and on one occasion, in November 1557, saved\r\nthe town of Vesoul from pillage by a passing army. This pit is carefully\r\ndescribed by M. Hassenfratz, in the _Journal de Physique_, t. xx. p. 259\r\n(an. 1782), where he says that Cæsar was driven away from the town of\r\nVesoul, which he had intended to besiege, by the floods of water poured\r\nforth from the _frais-puits_. I know of no such incident in Cæsar's\r\nlife, though M. Hassenfratz quotes Cæsar's own words: the town of\r\nVesoul, too, had no historical existence before the 9th or 10th century\r\nof our era. There is also a pit near Vesoul which contains icicles in\r\nsummer, and may be the same as the _frais-puits_, for the old historian\r\nof Franche Comté, Gollut, in describing the latter, mentions that it is\r\nso cold that no one cares to explore it (pp. 91. 92).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See p. 122.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE OF THE GRÂCE-DIEU, OR LA BAUME, NEAR BESANÇON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grand and lovely scenery of the Val de Travers has at length been\r\nopened up for the ordinary tourist world, by the railway which connects\r\nPontarlier with Neufchâtel. The beauties of the valley are an\r\nunfortunate preparation for the dull expanse of ugly France which greets\r\nthe traveller passing north from the former town; but the country soon\r\nassumes a pleasanter aspect, and nothing can be more charming than the\r\nsoft green slopes, dotted with the richest pines, which form the\r\napproach to the station of Boujeailles. It is impossible for the most\r\ncareless traveller to avoid observing the ill effects produced upon the\r\ntrees on the south side of the forest of Chaux, by the crowded and\r\nneglected state in which they have been left, and the wet state of the\r\nsoil. The branches become covered with moss, which first kills them, and\r\nthen breaks them off, so that many tall and tapering sapins point their\r\nheads to the sky with trunks wholly guiltless of branches; while in\r\nother cases, where decay has not yet gone so far, the branches wear the\r\nappearance of gigantic stags' horns, with the velvet; and when a number\r\nof these interlace, the mosses unite in large dark patches, giving a\r\ncedar-like air to the scene of ruin.\r\n\r\nUp to this point, an elderly Frenchman in the carriage had been\r\nextremely offensive, from the evil odour of his Macintosh coat; but in\r\nanswer to a remark upon the improvement which the railway would effect,\r\nby providing ventilation for the forest, he gave so much information on\r\nthat subject, and gave it so pleasantly, and had evidently so good a\r\nknowledge of the topography of Franche Comté, that his coat speedily\r\nlost its smell, and we became excellent friends.\r\n\r\nIt is a tantalising thing to be whirled on a hot and dusty day through\r\ndistricts famous for their wines, the dust and heat standing out in\r\nmore painful colours by contrast with the recollection of cooling\r\ndraughts which other occasions have owed to such vineyards; though,\r\nafter all, the true method of facing heat with success is to drink no\r\nwine. At any rate, the vineyards of Arbois must always be interesting,\r\nand if the stories of the Templars' orgies be true, we may be sure\r\nthat the chapelry which they possessed in that town would be a\r\nfavourable place of residence with the order; possibly Rule XVI. might\r\nthere be somewhat relaxed. 'The good wine of Arbois,' _la meilleure\r\ncave de Bourgougne_, a judicious old writer says, had free entry into\r\nall the towns of the Comté; and when Burgundy was becoming imperial,\r\nMaximilian extended this privilege through all the towns of the\r\nempire. A hundred years later, it had so high a character, that the\r\ntroops of Henri IV. turned away from the town, announcing that they\r\ndid not wish to attack _ceulx estoient du naturel de leur vin, qui\r\nfrappe partout_;[26] and the king was forced to come himself, with his\r\nconstable and marshals, to beat down the walls, in the course of which\r\nundertaking his men felt the vigour of the inhabitants to a greater\r\nextent than he liked. It is said that when he had taken the town, the\r\nmunicipality received him in state, and supplied him with wine of the\r\ncountry. He praised the wine very highly, on which one of the body had\r\nthe ill taste to assure him that they had a better wine than that.\r\n'You keep it, perhaps,' was the royal rebuke, 'for a better occasion.'\r\nHenry had a great opinion of this wine; and the Duc de Sully states,\r\nin his Memoirs, that when the Duc de Mayenne retired from the league\r\nagainst the king, and came to Monceaux to tender his allegiance, Henry\r\npunished him for past offences by walking so fast about the grounds of\r\nthe château, that the poor duke, what with his sciatica, and what with\r\nhis fat, at last told him with an expressive gesture that a minute\r\nmore of it would kill him. The king thereupon let him go, and promised\r\nhim some _vin d'Arbois_ to set him right again.[27]\r\n\r\nThe present appearance of the town, as seen from the high level followed\r\nby the railway, scarcely recalls the time when Arbois was known as _le\r\njardin de noblesse_, and Barbarossa dated thence his charters, or Jean\r\nSans-peur held there the States of Burgundy. Gollut[28] tells a story of\r\na dowager of Arbois, mother-in-law to Philip V. and Charles IV. of\r\nFrance, which outdoes legend of Bishop Hatto. Mahaut d'Artois was an\r\nelderly lady remarkable for her charities, and was by consequence always\r\nsurrounded by large crowds of poor folk during her residence at the\r\nChâtelaine, the ruins of which lie a mile or two from Arbois. On the\r\noccasion of a severe famine in Burgundy, she collected a band of her\r\nmendicant friends in a stable, and burned them all, saying that '_par\r\npitié elle hauoit faict cela, considerant les peines que ces pauvres\r\ndebuoient endurer en temps de si grande et tant estrange famine_.'\r\n\r\nThere is a Val d'Amour near Arbois, but the more beautiful valley of\r\nthat name lies between Dôle and Besançon, and, as we passed its\r\nneighbourhood, my friend with the Macintosh informed me that as it was\r\nclear from my questions that I was drawing up a history of the Franche\r\nComté, he must beg me to insert a legend respecting the origin of this\r\nname, Val d'Amour, which, he believed, had never appeared in print. I\r\ndisclaimed the history, but accepted the legend, and here it is:--The\r\nSeigneur of Chissey was to marry the heiress of a neighbouring\r\nseigneurie, and, it is needless to add, she was very lovely, and he was\r\nhandsome and brave. A lake separated the two châteaux, and the young man\r\nnot unfrequently returned by water rather late in the evening; and so it\r\nfell out that one night he was drowned. The lady naturally grieved\r\nsorely for her loss, and put in train all possible means for recovering\r\nher lover's body. Time, however, passed on, and no success attended her\r\nefforts, till at length she caused the hills which dammed up the waters\r\nto be pierced, and then De Chissey was found. A village sprang up near\r\nthe outlet thus made, and took thence its name Percée, or, as men now\r\nspell it, Parcey; and the rich vegetation which speedily covered the\r\nvalley, where once the lake had been, gave it such an air of happiness\r\nand beauty, that the people remembered its origin, and called it the\r\nValley of Love. It is a fact that Parcy was not always so spelled, for\r\nNoble Constantin Thiehault, Sieur de Perrecey, was a witness to the\r\ntreaty for the transference of a miraculous host from Faverney to Dôle\r\nin 1608, and old maps and books give it as Perrecey and Parrecey\r\nindifferently. The De Chisseys, whose names may be found among the\r\nfemale prebends of Château-Chalon, with its necessary sixteen quarters,\r\nfilled a considerable place in the history of the Comté from the\r\nCrusades downwards, and known as _les Fols de Chissey_, the brave[29]\r\nand dashing, and witty De Chisseys--qualities which no doubt were\r\npossessed by the poor young man for whom the fair Chatelaine drained the\r\nVal d'Amour.\r\n\r\nAs we drew nearer to Besançon, each turn of the small streams, and each\r\nlow rounded hill, might have served as an illustration to Cæsar's\r\n'Commentaries.' Now at length it was seen how, whatever the result of a\r\nbattle, there was always a _proximus collis_ for the conquered party to\r\nretire to; and it would have been easy to find many suitable scenes for\r\nthe critical engagement, where the woods sloped down to a strip of\r\ngrass-land between their foot and the stream.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman knew his Cæsar, but he put that general in the fourth\r\ncentury B.C. He made mistakes, too, in quoting him, which were easily\r\ndetected by a memory bristling with the details of his phraseology, the\r\nindelible result of extracting the principal parts of his verbs, and the\r\nnominatives of his irregular nouns, from half a dozen generations of\r\nsmall boys. He promised me a rich Julian feast in Besançon, and was\r\ngreatly affected when he found that the Englishman could give him\r\nCæsar's description of his native town. He wholly denied the\r\namphitheatre with which one of our handbooks has gifted it; and this\r\ndenial was afterwards echoed by every one in Besançon, some even\r\nthinking it necessary to explain the difference between an amphitheatre\r\nand an arch of triumph, the latter still existing in the town. The\r\nJesuit Dunod relates that the amphitheatre was to be seen at the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century, in the ruined state in which the\r\nAlans and Vandals had left it after their successful siege in 406. It\r\nseems to have stood near the present site of the Madeleine.\r\n\r\nIt was a great satisfaction to find that the Frenchman had himself\r\nvisited the glacière which was the object of my search, and was able to\r\ngive some idea as to the manner of reaching it, for my information on\r\nthe subject was confined to a vague notice that there was an ice-cave\r\nfive leagues from Besançon. As so often happened in other cases, he\r\nadvised me not to go to it, but rather, if I must see a cave, to go to\r\nthe Grotto of Ocelles,[30] a collection of thirty or more caverns and\r\ngalleries near the Doubs, below Besançon. Seeing, however, that I was\r\nbent on visiting the glacière, he advised me not to go on Sunday, for\r\nthe Cardinal Archbishop had ordered the Trappists at the Chartreuse near\r\nnot to receive guests on that day; while Saturday, he thought, was\r\nalmost as bad, for nothing better than an omelette could be obtained on\r\ndays of abstinence. Saturday, then, was clearly the day to be chosen.\r\n\r\nThe first sight of Besançon explains at once why Cæsar was so anxious\r\nto forestall Ariovistus by occupying Vesontio, although the hill on\r\nwhich the citadel stands is not so striking as the similar hill at\r\nSalins, and the engines of modern warfare would promptly print their\r\ntelegrams on every stone and man in the place, from the neighbouring\r\nheights. The French Government has wisely taken warning from the\r\nbombardment by the Allies, and has covered the heights which command it\r\non either side with friendly fortifications, in which lie the keys of\r\nthe place. Historically, Besançon is a place of great interest. It\r\nwitnessed the catastrophe of Julius Vindex, who had made terms with\r\nRufus, the general sent against him by Nero, but was attacked by the\r\ntroops of Rufus before they learned the alliance concluded between the\r\ntwo generals. Vindex was so much grieved by the slaughter of his troops,\r\nand the blow thus struck, by an unhappy accident, at his designs against\r\nthe emperor, that he put himself to death at the gates of the town,\r\nwhile the fight was still going on.[31] The Bisuntians claim to\r\nthemselves the glory acquired by the Sequani, whose chief city Vesontio\r\nwas, by the overthrow of Julius Sabinus, who asserted that he was the\r\ngrandson of a son of Julius Cæsar, and proclaimed himself emperor in\r\nthe time of Vespasian. The Sequani proceeded against him of their own\r\naccord, and conquered him in the interest of the reigning emperor; and\r\nhe and his wife Peponilla lived hid in a tomb for nine years. Here two\r\nsons were born to them; and when they were all discovered and carried to\r\nRome, Peponilla prettily told the emperor that she had brought up two\r\nsons in the tomb, in order that there might be other voices to intercede\r\nfor her husband's life besides her own. They were, however, put to\r\ndeath.[32]\r\n\r\nTo judge from the style of the hotels, Besançon is not visited by many\r\nEnglish travellers; and yet it well repays a visit, providing those who\r\ncare for such things with a full average of vaulted passages, and feudal\r\ngateways, and arcaded court-yards, with much less than the average of\r\nevil smell. There are gates of all shapes and times--Louis-Quatorze\r\ntowers, and fortifications specially constructed under Vauban's own eye;\r\nwhile the approach to the town, from the land side, is by a tunnel, cut\r\nthrough the live rock which forms a solid chord to the arc described by\r\nthe course of the river Doubs. This excavation, called appropriately the\r\n_Porte Taillée_, is attributed by the various inhabitants to pretty\r\nnearly all the famous emperors and kings who have lived from Julius\r\nCæsar to Louis XIV.: it owes its origin, no doubt, to the construction\r\nof the aqueduct which formerly brought into the town the waters pouring\r\nout of the rock at Arcier, two leagues from Besançon, and was the work\r\nprobably of M. Aurelius and L. Verus. Local antiquaries assign the\r\naqueduct to Agrippa, the son-in-law of Augustus, apparently for no\r\nbetter reason than because he built a similar work in Rome. The arch of\r\ntriumph[33] at the entrance to the upper town has been an inexhaustible\r\nsubject of controversy for many generations of antiquaries, and up to\r\nthe time of Dunod was generally attributed to Aurelian: that historian,\r\nhowever, believed that its sculptures represented the education of\r\nCrispus, the son of Constantine, and that the name Chrysopolis, by which\r\nBesançon was very generally known in early times, was only a corruption\r\nof Crispopolis. Earlier writers are in favour of the natural derivation\r\nof Chrysopolis, and assert that when the Senones lost their famous\r\nchief, the Brennus of Roman history, before Delphos, they built a town\r\nwhere Byzantium afterwards stood, and called it Bisantium and\r\nChrysopolis, in memory of their city of those names at home.\r\n\r\nThe Hôtel du Nord is a rambling old house, comfortable after French\r\nideas of comfort, and rejoicing in an excellent cuisine; though it is\r\ntrue that on one occasion, at least, _haricots verts à l'Anglaise_ meant\r\na mass of fibrous greens, swimming in a most un-English sea of\r\nartificial fat. It is a good place for studying the natural manners of\r\nthe untravelled Frenchman, who there sits patiently at the table, for\r\nmany minutes before dinner is served, with his napkin tucked in round\r\nhis neck, and his countenance composed into a look of much resignation.\r\nThe waiters are for the most part shock-headed boys, in angular-tail\r\ncoats well up in the back of the neck, who frankly confess, when any\r\norder out of the common run of orders is given, that a German patois\r\nfrom the left bank of the Rhine is their only extensive language. One of\r\nthese won my eternal gratitude by providing a clean fork at a crisis\r\nbetween the last savouries and the _plat doux_; for the usual practice\r\nwith the waiters, when anyone neglected to secure his knife and fork for\r\nthe next course, was to slip the plate from under the unwonted charge,\r\nand leave those instruments sprawling on the tablecloth in a vengeful\r\nmess of gravy. Chickens' bones were there dealt with on all sides as\r\nnature perhaps intended that they should be dealt with, namely, by\r\ntaking them between finger and thumb, and removing superfluities with\r\nthe teeth; and French officers with wasp-like waists, and red trousers\r\ngathered in plaits to match, boldly despised the sophistication of\r\nspoons, and ate their vanilla cream like men, by the help of bread and\r\nfingers. The manners and broken French of the stranger formed an open\r\nand agreeable subject of conversation, and the table was much quieter\r\nthan a Frenchman's _table d'hôte_ is sometimes known to be: on one\r\noccasion, however, all decorum was scattered to the winds, and the\r\nguests rushed out into the court-yard with disordered bibs and tuckers,\r\non the announcement by the head waiter of a '_chien à l'Anglaise_, not\r\nso high as a mustard-pot,' which one of the company promptly bought for\r\ntwenty-four francs, commencing its education on the spot by a lesson in\r\ncigar-smoking.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens in France that _café noir_ is a much more ready\r\nand abundant tap than water, and so it was here; notwithstanding which,\r\nthe bedroom apparatus was most comfortable and complete. The chambermaid\r\nwas a boy, and under his auspices a sheet of postage-stamps and a lead\r\npencil vanished from the table. When it was suggested to him that\r\npossibly they had been blown into some corner, and so swept away, he\r\nbrought a dustpan from a distant part of the house, and miraculously\r\ndiscovered the stamps perched upon a small handful of dust therein,\r\ndeferring the discovery and his consequent surprise till he reached my\r\nroom. It was curious that the stamps, which had before been in an open\r\nsheet, were now folded neatly together, and curled into the shape of a\r\nwaistcoat-pocket. He was inexorable about the pencil.\r\n\r\nNo certain information could be obtained in the hotel respecting the\r\nglacière; so an owner of carriages was summoned, and consulted as to the\r\nbest means of getting there. He naturally recommended that one of his\r\nown carriages should be taken as far as the Abbey of Grâce-Dieu, and\r\nthat we should start at five o'clock the next morning, with a driver who\r\nknew the way to the glacière from the point at which the carriage must\r\nbe left.[34] Five o'clock seemed very early for a drive of fifteen\r\nmiles; but the man asserted that instead of five leagues it was a good\r\nseven or eight, and so it turned out to be. This glacière may be called\r\na historical glacière, being the only one which has attracted general\r\nattention; and the mistake about its distance from Besançon arose very\r\nmany years ago, and has been perpetuated by a long series of copyists.\r\nThe distance may not be more than five leagues when measured on the map\r\nwith a ruler; but until the tunnels and via-ducts necessary for a crow\r\nline are constructed, the world must be content to call it seven and a\r\nhalf at least. The man bargained for two days' pay for the carriage, on\r\nthe plea that the horse would be so tired the next day that he would not\r\nbe able to do any work, and as that day was Sunday, the great day for\r\nexcursions, it would be a dead loss. It so happened that the charge for\r\ntwo days, fifteen francs, was exactly what I paid elsewhere for one day,\r\nso there was no difficulty about the price.\r\n\r\nWe started, accordingly, at five o'clock. The day was delightfully\r\nfine, and in spite of the driver's peculiarity of speech, caused by a\r\nshort tongue, and aggravated by a villanous little black pipe clutched\r\nbetween his remaining teeth, we got through a large amount of question\r\nand answer respecting the country through which we passed. Of course,\r\nthe reins were carried through rings low down on the kicking-strap,\r\ningeniously placed so that each whisk of the horse's tail caught one or\r\nother rein; and then the process of extraction was a somewhat dangerous\r\none, for there was no splashboard, and the driver had to stow his legs\r\naway out of reach, before commencing operations. The landlord of the inn\r\nat Mühlinen, on the road from Kandersteg to Thun, has a worse\r\narrangement than even this, both reins passing through one small leather\r\nloop at the top of the kicking-strap; so that when the horse on one\r\noccasion ran away down a steep hill in consequence of the break refusing\r\nto act, the man in his flurry could not tell which rein to pull, to\r\nsteer clear of the wall of rock on one side, and the unfenced slope on\r\nthe other, and finally flung himself out in despair, leaving his English\r\ncargo behind.\r\n\r\nThere has evidently been at some time a vast lake near Besançon, and the\r\nold bottom of the lake is now covered with heavy meadow-grass, while the\r\ncorn-fields and villages creep down from the higher grounds, on the\r\nremains of promontories which stretch out into the plain. The people are\r\nin constant fear of inundation, and the driver informed me that in\r\nwinter large parts of the plain are flooded, the superfluous waters\r\nvanishing after a time into a great hole, whose powers of digestion he\r\ncould not explain. The villages which lie on the shores, as it were, of\r\nthe lake, rejoice in church-towers with bulbous domes, rising out of\r\nrich clusters of trees, and the early bells rang out through the crisp\r\nair with something of a Belgian sweetness. Farther on, the road passed\r\nthrough glorious wheat, clean as on an English model farm, save where\r\nsome picturesque farmer had devoted a corner to the growth of poppies.\r\nHere, as elsewhere, potatoes did not grow in ridges, but each root had a\r\nlittle hillock to itself; an unnatural early training which may account\r\nfor the strange appearance of _pommes de terre au naturel_.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has driven through the morning air for an hour or two before\r\nbreakfast, will understand the satisfaction with which, about seven\r\no'clock, we deciphered a complicated milestone into 14 kilomètres from\r\nBesançon, which meant breakfast at the next village, Nancray. The\r\nbreakfast was simple enough, owing to the absence of butter and other\r\nthings, and consisted of coffee in its native pot, and dry bread: the\r\nmilk was set on the table in the pan in which it had been boiled, and a\r\nsoup-ladle and a French wash-hand basin took the place of cup and spoon.\r\nA cat kept the door against sundry large and tailless dogs, whose\r\nappetites had not gone with their tails; and an old woman kindly\r\ndelivered a lecture on the most approved method of making a ptisan from\r\nthe flowers of the lime-tree, and on the many medicinal properties of\r\nthat decoction, to which she attributed her good health at so advanced\r\nan age. I silently supplemented her peroration by attributing her\r\ngarrulity to a more stimulating source.\r\n\r\nWhen we started again, it was time to learn something about the scene of\r\nour further proceedings, and the driver enunciated his views on monks in\r\ngeneral, _à propos_ to the Convent of Grâce-Dieu, the Chartreuse at\r\nwhich we were to leave our carriage, and obtain food for man and horse.\r\nThe Brothers, he said, were possessed of many mills, and were in\r\nconsequence enormously rich. Among the products of their industry, a\r\nliqueur known as _Chartreuse_ seemed to fill a high place in his esteem,\r\nfor he considered it to be better--and he said it as if that\r\ncomparative led into an eighth heaven--better even than absinthe. I had\r\nan opportunity of tasting this liqueur some weeks after, a few minutes\r\nbelow the summit of Mont Blanc, and certainly no one would suspect its\r\ngreat strength, which is entirely disguised by an innocent and insidious\r\nsweetness, as unlike absinthe as anything can possibly be: impressions,\r\nhowever, respecting meat and drink, and all other matters, are not very\r\ntrustworthy when received near the top of the Calotte. It has lately\r\nbeen found that the worthy Brothers of the Grande Chartreuse have been\r\nsystematically defrauding the revenue, by returning their profits on the\r\nmanufacture of this liqueur at something merely nominal as compared with\r\nthe real gains. I could not learn whether the ceremony of blessing each\r\nbatch of the liqueur, before sending it out to intoxicate the world, is\r\nperformed with so much solemnity at Grâce-Dieu as at Grenoble; and,\r\nindeed, it rests only on the assertion of the short-tongued Bisuntian\r\nthat the manufacture is carried on at all at the former place.[35]\r\n\r\nHaving communicated such information as he possessed, the man seemed to\r\nthink he had a right to learn something in return, and administered\r\nvarious questions respecting customs which he believed to prevail in\r\nEngland. He evidently did not credit the denial of the truth of what he\r\nhad heard, nor yet the assertion, in answer to another question, that\r\nEnglish hothouse grapes are three or four times as large as the ordinary\r\ngrapes of France, and well-flavoured in at least a like proportion. The\r\nroadside was planted with apple-trees, and these were overgrown with\r\nmistletoe; so, by way of correcting his idea that the English are a sad\r\nand gloomy people, I informed him of the use made of this parasite by\r\nyoung people in the country at Christmas-time. Instead, however, of\r\nbeing thereby impressed with our national liveliness, he looked with a\r\nsort of supercilious contempt upon a people who could require the\r\nintervention or sanction of anything external in such a matter, and\r\nturned the conversation to some more worthy subject.\r\n\r\nAt length we passed into a pleasant valley, with thrushes singing, and\r\nmuch chirping of those smaller birds, in the murder of which, sitting,\r\nconsists _le sport_ in the eyes of many gentlemen of France. Up to this\r\npoint, nothing could have been more unlike the scenery which I had so\r\nfar found to be associated with glacières; but now the country became\r\nslightly more Jurane, and limestone precipices on a small scale rose up\r\non either hand, decked with the corbel towers which result from the\r\nweathering of the rock. It was the Jura in softer as well as smaller\r\ntype, for all the desolate wildness which characterises the more rocky\r\npart of that range was gone, and there were no signs of the grand\r\npine-scenery, or needle-foliage, as the Germans call it; the trees were\r\nall oak and ash and beech, and the rocks were much more neat and\r\norderly, and of course less grand, than their contorted kindred farther\r\nsouth. The valley speedily became very narrow, and a final bend brought\r\nus face-to-face with the buildings of the Abbaye de Grâce-Dieu, striking\r\nfrom their position--filling, as they do, the breadth of the\r\nvalley,--but in no way remarkable architecturally. The journey had been\r\nso long that it was now ten o'clock; and as we were due in Besançon at\r\nfive in the evening, we put the horse up as quickly as possible, in a\r\nshed provided by the Brothers, and set off on foot for the glacière,\r\nhalf an hour distant. About a mile and a half from the convent, the\r\nvalley comes to an end, the rocks on the opposite sides approaching so\r\nclose to each other as only to leave room for a large flour-mill,\r\nbelonging to the Brothers, and for the escape-channel of the stream\r\nwhich works the mill. This building is quite new, and might almost be\r\ntaken for a fortification against inroads by the head of the valley,\r\nespecially as the words _Posuerunt me custodem_ appear on the face,\r\napplying, however, to an image of the Virgin, which presides over the\r\nestablishment. The monks have expended their superfluous time and\r\nenergies upon the erection of crosses of all sizes on every projecting\r\npeak and point of rock, one cross more sombre than the rest marking the\r\nscene of a recent death. As I had no means of determining the elevation\r\nof this district above the sea,[36] I made enquiries as to the climate\r\nin winter; and one of the Brothers told me, that it was an unusual thing\r\nwith them to have a fall of snow amounting to two joints of a remarkably\r\ndirty finger.\r\n\r\nAt the mill, the path turns up the steep wooded hill on the right, and\r\nleads through young plantations to a small cottage near the glacière,\r\nwhere the plantations give place to a well-grown beech wood. Here my\r\nconductor startled me by announcing that there was 20 centimes to pay\r\nto the farmer of the cave for entrance; an announcement which seemed to\r\ntake all the pleasure out of the expedition, and invested it with the\r\ndisagreeable character of sightseeing. The poor driver thought, no\r\ndoubt, with some trepidation upon the small amount of _pour-boire_ he\r\ncould expect from a monsieur on whom a demand for two pence produced so\r\nserious an effect, and it was difficult to make him understand that the\r\nfact and not the amount of payment was the trouble. When I illustrated\r\nthis by saying that I would gladly give a franc to be allowed to enter\r\nthe glacière free, he seemed to think that if I would entrust him with\r\nthe franc, he might possibly arrange that little matter for me.\r\n\r\nThe immediate approach to the glacière is very impressive. The surface\r\nof the ground slopes slightly upwards, and the entrance, from north to\r\nsouth, is by a broad inclined plane, of gentle fall at first, which\r\nrapidly becomes steep enough to require zigzags. The walls of rock on\r\neither side are very sheer, and increase of course in height as the\r\nplane of entrance falls. The whole length of the slope is about 420\r\nfeet, and down a considerable part of this some grasses and flowers are\r\nto be found: the last 208 feet are covered more or less with ice;\r\nthough, at the time of my visit, the furious rains of the end of June,\r\n1864, had washed down a considerable amount of mud, and so covered some\r\nof the ice. There were no ready means of determining the thickness of\r\nthis layer of ice, for the descent of which ten or eleven zigzags had\r\nbeen made by the farmer. In one place, within 24 feet of its upper\r\ncommencement, it was from 2-1/2 to 3 feet thick; but the prominence of\r\nthat part seemed to mark it out as of more than the average thickness.\r\nEven where to all appearance there was nothing but mud and earth, an\r\nunexpected fall or two showed that all was ice below. Whether the driver\r\nhad previously experienced the treacherousness of this slope of ice,\r\nor whatever his motive might be, he left me to enter and explore alone.\r\n\r\nThe roof of the entrance is at first a mere shell, formed by the thin\r\ncrust of rock on which the surface-earth and trees rest high overhead;\r\nbut this rapidly becomes thicker, as shown in the section of the cave,\r\nand thus a sort of outer cave is formed, the real portal of the glacière\r\nbeing reached about 60 feet above the bottom of the slope. This outer\r\ncave presents a curious appearance, from the distinctness with which the\r\nseveral strata of the limestone are marked, the lower strata weathered\r\nand rounded off like the seats of an amphitheatre of the giants, and\r\nall, up to the shell-like roof, arranged in horizontal semicircles of\r\nvarious graduated sizes, showing their concavity; while at the bottom of\r\nthe whole is seen a patch of darkness, with two masses of ice in its\r\ncentre, looming out like grey ghosts at midnight. This darkness is of\r\ncourse the inner cave, the entrance to which, though it seems so small\r\nfrom above, is 78 feet broad.\r\n\r\nThe glacière itself may be said to commence as soon as this entrance,\r\nor perpendicular portal, is passed, and thus includes 60 feet of the\r\nlong slope of ice, from the foot of which to the farther end of the\r\ncave is 145 feet, the greatest breadth of the cave being 148 feet.\r\nImmediately below the portal I found a piece of the trunk of a large\r\ncolumn of ice, 7 feet long and 12 feet in girth, its fractured ends\r\ngiving the idea of the interior of a quickly-grown tree, in\r\nconsequence of the concentric arrangement of convergent prisms\r\ndescribed in the account of the Glacière of S. Georges. The wife of\r\nthe farmer told me afterwards that there had been two glorious\r\ncolumns at this portal, which the recent rains had swept away.\r\nExcepting a short space at the foot of the slope, and another towards\r\nthe farther end of the cave, the floor was covered with ice, in some\r\nparts from 3 to 4 feet thick: of this a considerable area had been\r\nremoved to a depth of 2 1/2 or 3 feet, leaving a pond of water a foot\r\ndeep, with bottom and banks of ice. The rock which composes the true\r\nfloor rises at the farthest end of the cave, and the roof is so\r\narranged that a sort of private chapel is there formed; and from a\r\nfissure in the dome a monster column of ice had been constructed on\r\nthe floor, which, at the time of my visit, had lost its upper parts,\r\nand stood as a hollow truncated cone with sides a foot thick, and with\r\nseas of ice streaming from it, and covering the rising pavement of the\r\nchapel. Without an axe, and without help, I was unable to measure the\r\ngirth of this column, which had not been without companions on a\r\nsmaller scale in the immediate neighbourhood. At the west end of the\r\ncave, the wall was thickly covered for a large space with small\r\nlimestone stalactites, producing the effect of many tiers of fringe on\r\na shawl; while from a dark fissure in the roof a large piece of fluted\r\ndrapery of the same material hung, calling to mind some of the vastly\r\ngrander details of the grottoes of Hans-sur-Lesse in Belgium: down\r\nthis wall there was also a long row of icicles, on the edges of a\r\nnarrow fissure. The north-west corner was very dark, and an opening in\r\nthe wall of rock high above the ground suggested a tantalising cave up\r\nthere: the ground in this corner was occupied by the shattered remains\r\nof numerous columns of ice, which had originally covered a circular\r\narea between 60 and 70 feet in circumference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERTICAL SECTION OF THE GLACIÈRE OF GRÂCE-DIEU, NEAR\r\nBESANÇON.]\r\n\r\nThe three large masses of ice which rendered this glacière in some\r\nrespects more remarkable than any of those I have seen, lay in a line\r\nfrom east to west, across the middle of the cave, on that part of the\r\nfloor where the ice was thickest. The central mass was extremely\r\nsolid, but somewhat unmeaning in shape, being a rough irregular\r\npyramid; its size alone, however, was sufficient to make it very\r\nstriking, the girth being 66-1/2 feet at some distance from the\r\nice-floor with which it blended. The mass which lay to the east of\r\nthis was very lovely, owing to the good taste of some one who had\r\nfound that much ice was wont to accumulate on that spot, and had\r\naccordingly fixed the trunk of a small fir-tree, with the upper\r\nbranches complete, to receive the water from the corresponding fissure\r\nin the roof. The consequence was, that, while the actual tree had\r\nvanished from sight under its icy covering, excepting on one side\r\nwhere a slight investigation betrayed its presence, the mass of ice\r\nshowed every possible fantasy of form which a mould so graceful could\r\nsuggest. At the base, it was solid, with a circumference of 37 feet.\r\nThe huge column, which had collected round the trunk of the fir-tree,\r\nbranched out at the top into all varieties of eccentricity and beauty,\r\neach twig of the different boughs becoming, to all appearance, a solid\r\nbar of frosted ice, with graceful curve, affording a point of\r\nsuspension for complicated groups of icicles, which streamed down side\r\nby side with emulous loveliness. In some of the recesses of the\r\ncolumn, the ice assumed a pale blue colour; but as a rule it was white\r\nand very hard, not so regularly prismatic as the ice described in\r\nformer glacières, but palpably crystalline, showing a structure not\r\nunlike granite, with a bold grain, and with a large predominance of\r\nthe glittering element. But the westernmost mass was the grandest and\r\nmost beautiful of all. It consisted of two lofty heads, like weeping\r\nwillows in Carrara marble, with three or four others less lofty,\r\nresembling a family group of lions' heads in a subdued attitude of\r\ngrief, richly decked with icy manes. Similar heads seemed to grow out\r\nhere and there from the solid sides of the huge mass. The girth was\r\n76-1/2 feet, measured about 2 feet from the floor. When this column was\r\nlooked at from the side removed from the entrance to the cave, so\r\nthat it stood in the centre of the light which poured down the long\r\nslope from the outer world, the transparency of the ice brought it to\r\npass that the whole seemed set in a narrow frame of impalpable liquid\r\nblue, the effect of light penetrating through the mass at its extreme\r\nedges. The only means of determining the height of this column was by\r\ntying a stone to the end of a string, and lodging it on the highest\r\nhead; but this was not an easy process, as I was naturally anxious not\r\nto injure the delicate beauty which made that head one of the\r\nloveliest things conceivable; and each careful essay with the stone\r\nseemed to involve as much responsibility as taking a shot at a hostile\r\nwicket, in a crisis of the game, instead of returning the ball in the\r\nconventional manner. When at last it was safely lodged, the height\r\nproved to be 27 feet. I had hoped to find it much more than this, from\r\nthe grandeur of the effect of the whole mass, and I took the trouble\r\nto measure the knotted string again with a tape, to make sure that\r\nthere was no mistake. The column formed upon the fir-tree was 3 or 4\r\nfeet lower.\r\n\r\nI have since found many notices of this glacière in the Memoirs of the\r\nFrench Academy and elsewhere, extracts from which will be found in a\r\nlater chapter. These accounts are spread over a period of 200 years,\r\nextending from 1590 to 1790, and almost all make mention of the columns\r\nor groups of columns I have described; but, without exception, the\r\nheights given or suggested in the various accounts are much less than\r\nthose which I obtained as the result of careful measurement. The latest\r\ndescription of a visit to the glacière states a fact which probably will\r\nbe held to explain, the present excess of height above that of earlier\r\ntimes.[37] The citizen Girod-Chantrans, who wrote this description, had\r\nprocured the notes of a medical man living in the neighbourhood, from\r\nwhich it seemed that Dr. Oudot made the experiment, in 1779, of fixing\r\nstakes of wood in the heads of the columns, then from 4 to 5 feet high,\r\nand found that these stakes were the cause of a very large increase in\r\nthe height of the columns, ice gathering round them in pillars a foot\r\nthick. So that it is not improbable that the largest of the three masses\r\nof the present day owes its height, and its peculiar form, to a series\r\nof stakes fixed from time to time in the various heads formed under the\r\nfissures in the roof, though nothing but the most solid ice can now be\r\nseen. It would be very interesting to try this experiment in one of the\r\ncaves where, without any artificial help, such immense masses of ice are\r\nformed; and by this means columns might, in the course of a year or two,\r\nbe raised to the very roof. Further details on this subject will be\r\ngiven hereafter.\r\n\r\nThere was no perceptible draught of air in any part of the cave, and the\r\ncandles burned steadily through the whole time of my visit, which\r\noccupied more than two hours. The centre was sufficiently lighted by the\r\nday; but in the western corner, and behind the largest column,\r\nartificial light was necessary. The ice itself did not generally show\r\nsigns of thawing, but the whole cave was in a state of wetness, which\r\nmade the process of measuring and investigating anything but pleasant.\r\nI had placed two thermometers at different points on my first\r\nentrance--one on a drawing-board on a large stone in the middle of the\r\npond of water which has been mentioned, and the other on a bundle of\r\npencils at the entrance of the end chapel, in a part of the cave where\r\nthe ice-floor ceased for a while, and left the stones and rock bare. The\r\nformer gave 33°, the latter, till I was on the point of leaving, 31\r\n1/2°, when it fell suddenly to 31°. It was impossible, however, to stay\r\nany longer for the sake of watching the thermometer fall lower and lower\r\nbelow the freezing point; indeed, the results of sundry incautious\r\nfathomings of the various pools of water, and incessant contact of hands\r\nand feet with the ice, had already become so unpleasant, that I was\r\nobliged to desert my trusty hundred feet of string, and leave it lying\r\non the ice, from want of finger-power to roll it up. The thermometers\r\nwere both Casella's, but that which registered 31° was the more lively\r\nof the two, the other being mercurial, with a much thicker stem: the\r\ndifference in sensitiveness was so great, that when they were equally\r\nexposed to the sun in driving home, the one ran up to 93° before the\r\nother had reached 85°.\r\n\r\nIn leaving the glacière, I found a little pathway turning off along the\r\nface of the rock on the left hand, a short way up the slope of entrance,\r\nand looking as if it might lead to the opening in the dark wall on the\r\nwestern side of the cave. After a time, however, it came to a corner\r\nwhich it seemed an unnecessary risk to attempt to pass alone; and my\r\nprudence was rewarded by the discovery that, after all, the supposed\r\ncave could not be thus reached. It is said that this other cave was the\r\nplace to which the inhabitants fled for refuge when their district was\r\ninvaded, probably by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar with his 10,000 Swedes,\r\nand that a ladder 40 feet long is necessary for getting at it.\r\n\r\nThe driver had long ago absconded when I returned to the upper regions;\r\nbut the wife of the farmer of the grotto was there, and communicated\r\nall that she knew of the statistics of the ice annually removed. She\r\nsaid that in 1863 two chars were loaded every day for two months, each\r\nchar taking about 600 kilos, the wholesale price in Besançon being 5\r\nfrancs the hundred kilos. Since the quintal contains 50 kilos, it will\r\nbe seen that this account does not agree with the statement of Renaud as\r\nto the amount of ice each char could take. No doubt, a char at S.\r\nGeorges may mean one thing, and a char in the village of Chaux another;\r\nbut the difference between 12 quintaux and 50 or 60 is too great to be\r\nthus explained, and probably Madame Briot made some mistake. Her\r\nhusband, Louis Briot, works alone in the cave, and has twelve men and a\r\ndonkey to carry the ice he quarries to the village of Chaux, a mile from\r\nthe glacière, where it is loaded for conveyance to Besançon. He uses\r\ngunpowder for the flooring of ice, and expects the eighth part of a\r\npound to blow out a cubic metre; and if, by ill luck, the ice thus\r\nprocured has stones on the lower side, he has to saw off the bottom\r\nlayer. Madame Briot said I was right in supposing March to be the great\r\ntime for the formation of ice, as she had heard her husband say that the\r\ncolumns were higher then than at any other time of the year: she also\r\nconfirmed my views as to the disastrous effects of heavy rain. As with\r\nevery other glacière of which I could obtain any account, excepting the\r\nLower Glacière of the Pré de S. Livres, she complained that the ice had\r\nnot been so beautiful and so abundant this year as last, although the\r\nwinter had been exceptionally severe.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Jean Bontemps, Conseiller au bailliage d'Arbois.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: 'Allez vous en reposer, rafraischir et boire un coup au\r\nchasteau, car vous en avez bon besoin; j'ay du vin d'Arbois en mes\r\noffices, dont je vous envoyeray deux bouteilles, car je scay bien que\r\nvous ne le hayés pas.'--_Petitot_. iii. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Mém. de la Comté de Bourgougne, Dôle, 1592, p. 486.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: One of the Seigneurs de Chissey, Michaud de Changey, who\r\ndied in high office in 1480, was known by preeminence as _le Brave_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Dr. Buckland visited these caves in 1826, to look for\r\nbones, of which he found a great number.

The Paris correspondent of the 'Times'\r\ngave, some months since (see the impression of Jan. 20, 1865), an\r\naccount of an interesting trial respecting the manufacture of the\r\nliqueur peculiar to the Abbey of Grâce-Dieu. From this account it\r\nappears that the liqueur was formerly called the Liqueur of the\r\nGrâce-Dieu, but is now known as Trappistine. It is limpid and oily;\r\npossesses a fine aroma, a peculiar softness, a mild but brisk flavour,\r\nand so on. It was invented by an ecclesiastic who was once the Brother\r\nMarie-Joseph, and prior of the convent, but is now M. Stremler, having\r\nbeen released by the Pope from his vows of obedience and poverty, in\r\norder that he might teach Christianity to the infidels of the New World.\r\nThe Brothers took the question of the renunciation of poverty into their\r\nown hands, by declining to give up the money which Brother Marie-Joseph\r\nhad originally brought into the society; so M. Stremler, being now\r\nmoneyless, commenced the secular manufacture of the seductive\r\nTrappistine, in opposition to the regular manufacture within the walls\r\nof the Abbey, abstaining, however, from the use of the religious label\r\nwhich is the Brothers' trade-mark. The unfortunate inventor was fined\r\nand condemned in costs for his piracy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: See p. 310.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: _Journal des Mines_, Prairial, an iv., pp. 65, &c.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBESANÇON AND DÔLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was so far advanced when I returned to the convent, that\r\nit was clearly impossible to reach Besançon at five o'clock, and\r\nconsequently there was time to inspect the Brothers and their buildings.\r\nThe field near the convent was gay with haymakers; and the brown monks,\r\nwith here and there a priest in _ci-devant_ white, moved among the hired\r\nlabourers, and stirred them up by exhortation and example,--with this\r\ndifference, that while it was evidently the business of the monks so to\r\ndo, the priests, on the other hand, had only taken fork in hand for the\r\nsake of a little gentle exercise. One unhappy Jacques Bonhomme made hot\r\nand toilsome hay in thick brown clothes, plainly manufactured from a\r\ndefunct Brother's gown; for, to judge from appearances, a cast-off gown\r\nis a thing unknown. It was good to see a Brother, in horn spectacles of\r\nmediæval cut, tenderly chopping a log for firewood, and peering at it\r\nthrough his spectacles after each stroke, as a man examines some\r\ndelicate piece of natural machinery with a microscope; to see another\r\nBrother, the sphere of whose duties lay in the flour-mill, standing in\r\nthe doorway with brown robe and shaven crown all powdered alike with\r\nwhite, and a third covered from head to foot with sawdust; or, best of\r\nall, to see an antique Brother, with scarecrow legs, and low shoes which\r\nhad presumably been in his possession or that of his predecessors for a\r\nlong series of years, wheeling a barrow of liquid manure, with his gown\r\nlooped up high by means of stout whipcord and an arrangement of large\r\nbrass rings. The Brother whose business it was to do such cooking as\r\nmight be required by visitors, grinned in the most friendly and\r\nengaging manner from ear to ear when he was looked at; and, by fixing\r\nhim steadily with the eye, he could be kept for considerable spaces of\r\ntime standing in the middle of the kitchen, knife in hand, with the\r\ncorners of his mouth out of sight round his broad cheeks. His ample\r\nfront was decked with a blue apron, suspended from his shoulders, and\r\nconfined round the convexity of his waist by an old strap which no\r\nrespectable costermonger would have used as harness. The soup served was\r\nby courtesy called _soupe maigre,_ but it was in fact _soupe maigre_\r\ndiluted by many homoeopathic myriads, and the Brother showed much\r\ncuriosity as to my opinion of its taste--a curiosity which I could not\r\nsatisfy without hurting his professional pride. When that course was\r\nfinished, the large-faced cook suggested an omelette, as the most\r\nsubstantial thing allowed on eves, proceeding to draw the materials from\r\na closet which so fully shared in the general abstinence from water as a\r\nmeans of cleansing, that I shut my eyes upon all further operations, and\r\nate the eventual omelette in faith. Its excellence called forth such\r\nhearty commendations, that there seemed to be some danger of the mouth\r\nnot coming right again. Then salads, and bread and butter, and wine, and\r\nvarious kinds of cheese were brought, which made in all a very fair\r\ndinner for a fast-day.\r\n\r\nThe culinary monk knew nothing of the history of his convent, beyond the\r\nbare year of its foundation, and displayed a monotonous dead level of\r\nignorance on all topographical and historical questions: to him the\r\n_Pain d'Abbaye_[38] meant nothing further than the staff of life there\r\nprovided, and he neither knew himself nor could recommend any Brother\r\nwho knew anything about the glacière. He was a German, and we talked of\r\nhis native Baiern and the modern glories of his capital; and when his\r\nquestions elicited a declaration of my profession, he passed up to\r\nSaxony, and pinned me with Luther. Finding that I objected to being so\r\npinned, and repudiated something of that which his charge involved, he\r\nwaived Luther, of whom he knew nothing beyond his name, and came down\r\nupon me triumphantly with the word Protestant. I explained to him, of\r\ncourse, that the worthy Elector, and his friends who protested, had not\r\nmuch to do with the Anglican branch of the Church Catholic; and then the\r\nold task had to be gone through of assuring the assembled Brothers that\r\nwe in England have Sacraments, have Orders, have a Trinitarian Creed.\r\n\r\nAt length, about half-past three, we started for Besançon, paying of\r\ncourse _à volonté_ for food and entertainment, as we did not choose to\r\nqualify as paupers. The driver told me on the way that there was another\r\nglacière at Vaise, a village three or four kilomètres from Besançon, and\r\nat no great distance from the road by which we should approach the town;\r\nso, when we reached the crest above Morre, where the road passes the\r\nfinal ridge by means of a tunnel, I paid the carriage off, and walked to\r\nthe village of Vaise. The public-house knew of the glacière--knew indeed\r\nof two,--further still, kept the keys of both. This was good news,\r\nthough the idea of keys in connection with an ice-cave was rather\r\nstrange; and I proposed to organise an expedition at once to the\r\nglacières. The male half of the auberge declared that he was forbidden\r\nto open them to strangers, except by special order from a certain\r\nmonsieur in Besançon; but the female half, scenting centimes, stated her\r\nbelief that the monsieur in Besançon could never wish them to turn away\r\na stranger who had come so many kilomètres through the dust to see the\r\nice. She put the proposed disobedience in so persuasive and Christian a\r\nform, that I was obliged to take the husband's side,--not that he was in\r\nany need of support, for he had been longer married than Adam was, and\r\nshowed no signs of giving way. It turned out, after all, that though\r\nthere was no doubt about the existence of the glacières, there was\r\nequally no doubt that they were _glacières artificielles_, being simply\r\nice-houses dug in the side of a hill, and the property of a _glacier_ in\r\nBesançon; so that my friend the driver had sent me to a mare's-nest.\r\n\r\nThe pathway across the hills to Besançon was rather intricate, and by\r\ngood fortune an old Frenchman appeared, who was returning from his work\r\nat a neighbouring church, and served as companion and guide. He had bid\r\nfarewell to sixty some years before, and, being a builder, had been\r\ngoing up and down a ladder all day, with full and empty _hottes_, to an\r\nextent which outdid the Shanars of missionary meetings; and yet he\r\nwalked faster than any foreigner of my experience. He talked in due\r\nproportion, and told some interesting details of the bombardment of\r\nBesançon, which he remembered well. When he learned that I was not\r\nGerman, but English, he told me they did not say _Anglais_ there, but\r\n_Gaudin_,--I was a _Gaudin_. This he repeated persistently many times,\r\nwith an air worthy of General Cyrus Choke, and half convinced me that\r\nthere was something in it, and that I might after all be a Gaudin. It\r\nwas not till some hours after, that I remembered the indelible\r\nimpression made by the piety of speech of recent generations of\r\nEnglishmen upon the French nation at large, and thus was enabled to\r\ntrace the origin of the name _Gaudin_. The old man evidently believed\r\nthat it was the proper thing to call an Englishman by that name; thus\r\nreminding me of a story told of a French soldier in the Austrian service\r\nduring the long early wars with Switzerland. The Austrians called the\r\nSwiss, in derision, Kühmelkers--a term more opprobrious than _bouviers_;\r\nand it is said that, after the battle of Frastens--one of the battles of\r\nthe Suabian war,--a Frenchman threw himself at the feet of some Grisons\r\nsoldiers, and innocently prayed thus for quarter; '_Très-chers,\r\ntrès-honorables, et très-dignes Kühmelkers! au nom de Dieu, ne me tuez\r\npas_!'\r\n\r\nThe town of Besançon seems to spend its Sunday in fishing, and is\r\napparently well contented with that very limited success which is wont\r\nto attend a Frenchman's efforts in this branch of _le sport_. There is a\r\nproverb in the patois of Vaud which says '_Kan on vau dau pesson, sé fo\r\nmolli_;'[39] and on this the Bisuntians act, standing patiently half-way\r\nup the thigh in the river, as the Swiss on the Lake of Geneva and other\r\nlakes may be seen to do. It is all very well to wade for a good salmon\r\ncast, or to spend some hours in a swift-foot[40] Scotch stream for the\r\nsake of a lively basket of trout; but to stand in a Sunday coat and hat,\r\nand 2-1/2 feet of water, watching a large bung hopelessly unmoved on the\r\nsurface, is a thing reserved for a Frenchman indulging in a weekly\r\nintoxication of Sabbatical sport, under the delirious form of the\r\n_chasse aux goujons_.\r\n\r\nClean as the town within the circuit of the river is, the houses which\r\noverhang the water on the other side are picturesque and dirty in the\r\nextreme, story rising above story, and balcony above balcony. It does\r\nnot increase their beauty, and to a fastidious nose it must militate\r\nagainst their eligibility as places of residence, that there is\r\napparently but one drain, an external one, which follows the course of\r\nthe pillars supporting the various balconies: nevertheless, from the\r\nopposite side of the river, and when the wind sets the other way, they\r\nare sufficiently attractive. In this quarter is found the finest church,\r\nthe Madeleine, with a very effective piece of sculpture at the east end.\r\nThe sculpture is arranged on the bottom and farther side of a sort of\r\ncage, which is hung outside the church, but is visible from the inside\r\nthrough a corresponding opening in the east wall. The subject of the\r\nsculpture is 'The Sepulchre,' and the ends of the cage or box are\r\ncomposed of rich yellow glass, through which the external light streams\r\ninto the cave of the Sepulchre; and when the church itself is becoming\r\ndark, the effect produced by the light from the evening sky, passing\r\nthrough the deep-toned glass, and softly illuminating the Sepulchre, is\r\nindescribably solemn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATH IN THE DOUBS, AT BESANÇON.]\r\n\r\nWhen Besançon was supplied by the aqueduct with the waters of Arcier,\r\nthere was a great abundance of baths, as the remains discovered in\r\ndigging new foundations show; but in the present state of the town such\r\nthings are not easily met with. The floating baths on the river are\r\nappropriated to the other sex, and the only thing approaching to a male\r\nbath was of a nature entirely new to me, being constructed as\r\nfollows:--There is a water-mill in the town, with a low weir stretching\r\nacross the river, down which the water rushes with no very great\r\nviolence. At the foot of this weir a row of sentry-boxes is placed,\r\napproached by planks, and in these boxes the adventurer finds his\r\nbath.[41] A stout piece of wood-work is fixed horizontally along the\r\nface of the weir, and has the effect of throwing the downward water out\r\nof its natural direction, and causing it to describe an arch, so that it\r\ndescends with much force on to the weir at a point below the wood-work.\r\nHere two planks are placed, forming a seat and a support for the back,\r\nand a little lower still another plank for the feet to rest upon,\r\nwithout which the bather would have a good chance of being washed away.\r\nThe water boils noisily and violently on all sides and in all\r\ndirections, coming down upon the subject's shoulders with a heavy thud,\r\nwhich calls to mind the tender years when something softer than a cane\r\nwas used, and sends him forth like a fresh-boiled lobster. All this,\r\nwith towels, is not dear at fourpence.\r\n\r\nThe citadel is the great sight of Besançon, and the polite\r\nColonel-commandant attends at his office at convenient hours to give\r\npasses. What it might be to storm the position under the excitement of\r\nthe sport of war, I cannot say; but certainly it is a most trying affair\r\non a hot Sunday's afternoon, even when all is made smooth, and the gates\r\nare opened, by a comprehensive pass. The wall mentioned by Cæsar as a\r\ngreat feature of the place cut the site of the citadel off from the\r\ntown, and many signs of it were found when the cathedral of S. Stephen\r\nwas built, the unfortunate church which went down before the exigencies\r\nof a siege under Louis XIV. The barrack-master proved to be a most\r\ninteresting man, knowing many details of Cæsar's life and campaigns\r\nwhich I suspect were not known to that captain himself. He had served in\r\nAlgeria, and assented to the proposition that more soldiers died there\r\nof absinthe than of Arabs, stating his conviction that three-fourths of\r\nthe whole deaths are caused by that pernicious extract of wormwood, and\r\nthat he ought himself to have died of it long ago. He pointed out the\r\ndifference between the massive masonry of the period of the Spanish\r\noccupation and the less impressive work of more recent times, and showed\r\nthe dungeon from which Marshal Bourmont bought his escape, in the time\r\nof the first Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe floor of one of the little look-out towers is composed of a\r\ntombstone, representing a priest in full ecclesiastical dress, and my\r\nquestion as to how it came there elicited the following story:--When\r\nLouis XIV. was besieging the citadel, he placed his head-quarters, and a\r\nstrong battery, on the summit of the Mont Chaudane,[42] which commands\r\nthe citadel on one side as the Brégille does on the other. Among the\r\nbesieged was a monk named Schmidt, probably one of the Low-country men\r\nto whom the Franche Comté was then a sort of home, as forming part of\r\nthe dominions of Spain; and this monk was the most active supporter of\r\nthe defence, against the large party within the walls which was anxious\r\nto render the town. He was also an admirable shot; and on one of the\r\nlast days of the siege, as he stood in the little tower where the\r\ntombstone now lies, the King and his staff rode to the front of the\r\nplateau on the Mont Chaudane to survey the citadel; whereupon some one\r\npointed out to Schmidt that now he had a fair chance of putting an end\r\nat once to the siege and the invasion. Accordingly, he took a musket\r\nfrom a soldier and aimed at the King; but before firing he changed his\r\naim, remarking, that he, a priest, ought not to destroy the life of a\r\nman, and so he only killed the horse, giving the Majesty of France a\r\nroll in the mud. When the town was taken, the King enquired for the man\r\nwho killed his horse, and asked the priest whether he could have killed\r\nthe rider instead, had he wished to do so. 'Certainly,' Schmidt replied,\r\nand related the facts of the case. Louis informed him, that had he been\r\na soldier, he should have been decorated for his skill and his impulse\r\nof mercy; but, being a priest, he should be hung. The sentence was\r\ncarried out, and the priest's body was buried in the floor of the tower\r\nfrom which he had spared the King's life. If this be true, it was one of\r\nthe most unkingly deeds ever done.[43]\r\n\r\nThis siege took place in the second invasion or conquest of the Franche\r\nComté by Louis XIV., when Besançon held out for nine days against Vauban\r\nand the King: on the first occasion it had surrendered to Condé after\r\none day's siege, making the single stipulation that the Holy Shroud\r\nshould not be removed from the town.[44] The _Saincte Suaire_ was the\r\nrichest ecclesiastical treasure of the Bisuntians, being one of the two\r\nmost genuine of the many Suaires, the other being that of Turin, which\r\nwas supported by Papal Infallibility. Both were brought from the\r\nCrusades; and the one was presented to Besançon in 1206, the other to\r\nTurin in 1353. Bede tells a story of the proving of a Shroud by fire in\r\nthe eighth century, by one of the caliphs; and as its dimensions were 8\r\nfeet by 4, like that of Besançon, while the Shroud of Turin measured 12\r\nfeet by 3, the people of Besançon claimed that theirs was the one spoken\r\nof by Bede.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral of Besançon is no longer S. Stephen, since the destruction\r\nof that church by Louis XIV. The small Church of the Citadel is now\r\ndedicated to that saint, an inscription on the wall stating that it\r\ntakes the place of the larger church, _ex urbis obsidio anno 1674\r\nlapsae_, and offering an indulgence of 100 days for every visit paid to\r\nit, with the sensible proviso _una duntaxat vice per diem._ Soldiers not\r\nbeing generally made of the confessing sex, or of confessing material,\r\nthere is only one confessional provided for the 6,000 souls which the\r\ncitadel can accommodate.\r\n\r\nThe Cavalry Barracks are in the lower part of the town, and near them is\r\na large building with evident traces of ecclesiastical architecture on\r\nthe outside. It is, in fact, a very fine church converted into stables,\r\nretaining its interior features in excellent preservation. Under the\r\ncorn-bin lies a lady who had two husbands and fifteen children,\r\n_Antigone in parentes, Porcia in conjuges, Sempronia in liberos_; while\r\na few yards further east, less agreeably placed, is an ecclesiastic of\r\nthe Gorrevod family, who reckoned Prince and Bishop and Baron among his\r\ntitles. The nave of this Church of S. Michael accommodates thirty\r\nhorses, and the north aisle thirteen; the south is considered more\r\nselect, and is boarded off for the decani, in the shape of officers'\r\nchargers. The north side of the chancel gives room for six horses, and\r\nthe south side for a row of saddle-blocks. It had been an oversight on\r\nthe part of the original architect of the church that no place was\r\nprepared for the daily hay; a fault which the military restorers have\r\nremedied by improvising a lady-chapel, where the hay for the day is\r\nplaced in the morning. With Spelman in my mind, I asked if the stables\r\nwere not unhealthy; but the soldiers said they were the healthiest in\r\nthe town.[45]\r\n\r\nThe Glacière of Vaise had proved, as has been seen, to be a\r\nmare's-nest; and yet, after all, it produced a foal; for while I was\r\nendeavouring to overcome the evening heat of Besançon in a\r\n_spécialité_ for ice, I found that the owner of the establishment was\r\nalso the owner of the two glacières of Vaise; and in the course of the\r\nconversation which followed, he told me of the existence of a natural\r\nglacière near the village of Arc-sous-Cicon, twenty kilomètres from\r\nPontarlier, which he had himself seen. As I had arranged to meet my\r\nsisters at Neufchâtel, in two days' time, for the purpose of visiting\r\na glacière in the Val de Travers, this piece of information came very\r\nopportunely, and I determined to attempt both glacières with them.\r\n\r\nSome of the trains from Besançon stop for an hour at Dôle in passing\r\ntowards Switzerland by way of Pontarlier, and anyone who is interested\r\nin the Burgundian and Spanish wars of France should take this\r\nopportunity of seeing what may be seen of the town of Dôle and its\r\nmassive church-tower. The sieges of Dôle made it very famous in the\r\nlater middle ages, more especially the long siege under Charles\r\nd'Amboise, at the crisis of which that general recommended his soldiers\r\nto leave a few of the people for seed,[46] and the old sobriquet _la\r\nJoyeuse_ was punningly changed to _la Dolente_. It has had other claims\r\nupon fame; for if Besançon possessed one of the two most authentic Holy\r\nShrouds, Dôle was the resting-place of one of the undoubted miraculous\r\nHosts, which had withstood the flames in the Abbey of Faverney. It was\r\nfor the reception of this Host that the advocates of the Brotherhood of\r\nMonseigneur Saint Yves built the Sainte Chapelle at Dôle.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: One of the rights of the sovereigns of Burgundy was known\r\nby this name. The sovereign had the power of sending one soldier\r\nincapacitated by war to each abbey in the County, and the authorities of\r\nthe abbey were bound to make him a prebendary for life. In 1602, after\r\nthe siege of Ostend, the Archduke Albert exercised this right in favour\r\nof his wounded soldiers, forcing lay-prebendaries upon almost all the\r\nabbeys of the County of Burgundy. The Archduchess Isabella attempted to\r\nquarter such a prebendary upon the Abbey of Migette, a house of nuns,\r\nbut the inmates successfully refused to receive the warrior among them\r\n(Dunod, _Hist. de l'Église de Besançon_, i. 367). For the similar right\r\nin the kingdom of France, see Pasquier, _Recherches de la France_, l.\r\nxii. p. 37. Louis XIV. did not exercise this right after his conquest of\r\nthe Franche Comté, perhaps because the Hôtel des Invalides, to which the\r\nChurch was so large a contributor, met all his wants.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: '_Quand on veut du poisson, il se faut mouiller_;'\r\nreferring probably to the method of taking trout practised in the Ormont\r\nvalley, the habitat of the purest form of the patois. A man wades in the\r\nGrand' Eau, with a torch in one hand to draw the fish to the top, and a\r\nsword in the other to kill them when they arrive there; a second man\r\nwading behind with a bag, to pick up the pieces.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: 'Swift-foot Almond, and land-louping Braan.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The sentry-box is omitted in the accompanying\r\nillustration.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Believed to be derived from _Collis Dianæ_.

Thirty-eight years before, the\r\nreligious took so active a part in the defence of Dôle against Louis\r\nXIII., that the Capuchin Father d'Iche had the direction of the\r\nartillery; and when an officer of the enemy had seized the Brother\r\nClaude by the cowl, the Father Barnabas made the officer loose his hold\r\nby slaying him with a demi-pique. When Arbois was besieged by Henry IV.,\r\nthe Sieur Chanoine Pécauld is specially mentioned as proving himself a\r\n_bon harquebouzier._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: There is a painting by Vander Meulen, representing this\r\nsiege, in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: The Church of S. Philibert, in Dijon, now a forage\r\nmagazine, has an inscription let into the wall almost ludicrously out of\r\nkeeping with the present desecrated state of the building,--_Dilexi\r\nDomine Decorem Domus tuæ_, 1648.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: 'Qu'on les laisse pour grain!']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: In the year 1648, it was suspected that some decay was\r\ngoing on in the material of this Host, and the following translation\r\nfrom the Latin describes the investigation entered into by the Dean and\r\na large body of clergy and laity, in order to quiet the public\r\nmind:--'Après que tous les susnommés (viz. the Dean, Canons, President\r\nof the Parliament, &c.) étant présents eurent adorés le S. Sacrement, la\r\ncustode fut ouverte avec tout le respect possible; et alors le dit Doyen\r\naperçut un vermisseau roulé en spirale, qu'il saisit avec la pointe\r\nd'une épingle et plaça sur un corporal où chacun l'examina; puis on le\r\nbrûla avec un charbon pris dans l'encensoir, et ses cendres furent\r\njetées dans la piscine. On put alors constater tout le dommage que ce\r\nmisérable petit animal avait causé aux espèces sacrées dont les débris\r\nici tombaient en poussière, là se trouvaient rongés et lacérés, de telle\r\nsorte que l'Hostie n'avait presque plus rien de sa forme circulaire, et\r\nprésentait de profondes découpures partout où le vermisseau s'était\r\nlivré à ses sinueus es évolutions.']\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE OF MONTHÉZY, IN THE VAL DE TRAVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI rejoined my sisters at Neufchâtel on the 5th of July, and proceeded\r\nthence with them by the line which passes through the Val de Travers.\r\nOne of them had been at Fleurier, in 1860, on the day of the opening of\r\nthis line, and she added an interest to the various tunnels, by telling\r\nus that a Swiss gentleman of her acquaintance, who had taken a place in\r\none of the open carriages of the first train, found, on reaching the\r\ndaylight after one of the tunnels, that his neighbour had been killed by\r\na small stone which had fallen on to his head. Where the stone came\r\nfrom, no one could say, nor yet when it fell, for the unfortunate man\r\nhad made no sign or movement of any kind.\r\n\r\nEvery one must be delighted with the wonders of the line of rail, and\r\nthe beauties through which the engineer has cut his way. In valleys on a\r\nless magnificent scale, cuttings and embankments on the face of the hill\r\nare sad eyesores, as in railway-ruined Killiecrankie; but here Nature's\r\nworks are so very grand, that the works of man are not offensively\r\nprominent, being overawed by the very facts over which they have\r\ntriumphed. When we reached the more even part of the valley, where the\r\nReuse no longer roars and rushes far below, but winds quietly through\r\nthe soft grass on a level with the rail, the whole grouping was so\r\nexceedingly charming, and the river itself so suggestive of lusty trout,\r\nand the village of Noiraigue[48] looked so tempting as it nestled in a\r\nsheltered nook among the headlong precipices, that I registered in a\r\nsafe mental pigeon-hole a week at the auberge there with a fishing-rod,\r\nand excursions to the commanding summit in which the _Creux de Vent_ is\r\nfound. The engine-driver knew that he was in a region of beauties, and,\r\nwhen he whistled to warn his passengers that the train was about to move\r\non, he remained stationary until the long-resounding echoes died out,\r\nfloating lingeringly up the valley to neighbouring France.\r\n\r\nWe had no definite idea as to the _locale_ of the glacière we were now\r\nbent upon attacking. M. Thury's list gave the following\r\ninformation:--'_Glacière de Motiers, Canton de Neufchâtel, entre les\r\nvallées de Travers et de la Brévine, près du sentier de la Brévine_;'\r\nand this I had rendered somewhat more precise by a cross-examination of\r\nthe guard of the train on my way to Besançon. He had not heard of the\r\nglacière, but from what I told him he was inclined to think that Couvet\r\nwould be the best station for our purpose, especially as the 'Ecu' at\r\nthat place was, in his eyes, a commendable hostelry. Some one in Geneva,\r\nalso, had believed that Couvet was as likely as anything else in the\r\nvalley; so at Couvet we descended.[49]\r\n\r\nThis is a very clean and cheerful village, devoted to the lucrative\r\nmanufacture of _absinthe_, and producing inhabitants who look like\r\ngentlemen and ladies, and promenade the ways in bonnets and hats,\r\nafter a most un-Swiss-like fashion. They carefully restrict\r\nthemselves to the making of the poisonous product of their village,\r\nand have nothing to do with the consumption thereof:[50] hence nature\r\nhas a fair chance with them, and they are a healthy and energetic\r\nrace. The beauties of the surrounding mountains, with their fitful\r\nalternations of pasture and wood, and grey face of rock, are not\r\nmarred by the outward appearance, at least, of that which Bishop Heber\r\nlamented in a country where 'every prospect pleases.' An old lady is\r\ncommemorated in the annals of Couvet as an example of the healthiness\r\nof the situation, who saw seven generations of her family, having\r\nknown her great-grandfather in her early years, and living to nurse\r\ngreat-grandchildren in her old age. The landlord of the inn informed\r\nus, with much pride, that Couvet was the birthplace of the man who\r\ninvented a clock for telling the time at sea; by which, no doubt, he\r\nmeant the chronometer, invented by M. Berthoud. At Motiers, the next\r\nvillage, Rousseau wrote his _Lettres de la Montagne_, and thence it\r\nwas that he fled from popular violence to the island on the Lake of\r\nBienne.\r\n\r\nThe 'Ecu' promised us dinner in half an hour, and we strolled about in\r\nthe garden of that unsophisticated hotel for an hour and a half,\r\nreconciled to the delay by the beauty of the neighbouring hills, the\r\nwinding of the valley giving all the effect of a mountain-locked plain,\r\nwith barriers decked with firs. It will readily be conceived, however,\r\nthat three practical English people could not be satisfied to feed on\r\nbeauty alone for any very great length of time, and we caught the\r\nlandlady and became peremptory. She explained that dinner was quite\r\nready, but she had intended to give us the pleasure of an agreeable\r\nsociety, consisting of sundry Swiss who were due in another half-hour or\r\nso: she yielded, nevertheless, to our representations, and promised to\r\nserve the meal at once. We were speedily summoned to the\r\n_salle-à-manger,_ and entered a low smoke-stained wooden chamber, with\r\nno floor to speak of, and with huge beams supporting the roof, dangerous\r\nfor tall heads. The date on the door was 1690, and the chamber fully\r\nlooked its age. There was a long table of the prevailing hue, with a\r\nsimilar bench; and on the table three large basins, presumably\r\ncontaining soup, were ranged, each covered with its plate, and\r\naccompanied by a ricketty spoon of yellow metal and a hunch of black\r\nbread. A., who was hungry enough and experienced enough to have known\r\nbetter, began promptly a most pathetic 'Why surely!' but the landlady\r\nstopped her by opening a side door, and displaying a comfortable room in\r\nwhich a well-appointed table awaited us:--she had taken us through the\r\nkitchen rather than through the _salon_, in which were peasants smoking.\r\nWe were somewhat disconcerted when we heard that the unwashed-looking\r\nplace was the kitchen; but the landlady had made up for it by scrubbing\r\nher husband, who waited upon us, to a high pitch of presentability, and\r\nfurther experience showed that the 'Ecu' is to be highly commended for\r\nthe excellence and abundance and cheapness of its foods.\r\n\r\nThere are many natural curiosities in and near the Val de Travers, which\r\nwell repay the labour that must be expended upon them. The _Temple des\r\nFées_, on the western side of the Valley of Verrières, used to be called\r\nthe most beautiful grotto in Switzerland; and the great Cavern of La\r\nBaume, near Motiers, is said to be exceedingly wonderful. We were shown\r\nthe entrance to a line of caverns in the hills above Couvet, and were\r\ninformed that it was possible to pierce completely through the range,\r\nand pass out at the other side within sight of Yverdun. One of the\r\ncaverns in this valley had been explored by some of A. and M.'s Swiss\r\nfriends, and the account of what they had gone through was by no means\r\ninviting, seeing that the prevailing material was damp clay of a solid\r\ncharacter, arranged in steep slopes, up which progression must be made\r\nby inserting the fingers and toes as far as might be into the clay; and,\r\nof course, when the handful of unpleasant mud came away, the result was\r\nthe reverse of progression. To anyone who has only known the rope up the\r\npure white side of some snow mountain, the idea of being roped for the\r\npurpose of grappling with underground banks of adhesive mud and clay\r\nmust be horrible in the extreme. Another interesting natural phenomenon\r\nis presented by the source of the Reuse, that river gushing out from the\r\nrock in considerable volume, probably formed by the drainage of the Lake\r\nof Etallières, in the distant valley of La Brévine; while the\r\nLonge-aigue, on the contrary, is lost in a gulf of such horror that the\r\npeople call the mill which stands on its edge the _Moulin d'enfer_.\r\n\r\nAs usual, we were assured that many of these remarkable sights were far\r\nbetter worth a visit than the glacière, of which no one seemed to know\r\nanything. A guide was at length secured for the next morning, who had\r\nmade his way to the cave once in the winter-time and had been unable to\r\nenter it, and we settled down quietly to an evening of perfect rest. The\r\nwindows of the bedrooms being guiltless of blinds and curtains, the\r\neffect of waking, in the early morning, to find them blocked up, as it\r\nwere, by the green slopes of pasture and the dark bands of fir-woods\r\nwhich clothed the limiting hills, seemed almost magical, the foreground\r\nbeing occupied solely by the graceful curve of the dome of the\r\nchurch-tower, glittering with intercepted rays, and forming a bright\r\nomen for the day thus ushered in.\r\n\r\nIn due time the promised guide appeared, a sickly boy of unprepossessing\r\nappearance, and of _patois_ to correspond. I was at first tempted to\r\npropose that we should attack him stereoscopically, A. administering\r\nFrench and I simultaneous German, in the hope that the combination\r\nmight convey some meaning to him; but, after a time, we succeeded with\r\nFrench alone. Perhaps Latin would have made a more likely _mélange_ than\r\nGerman, and to give it him in three dimensions would not have been a bad\r\nplan. The route for the glacière runs straight up the face of the hill\r\nalong which the railway has been constructed; and as we passed through\r\nwoods of beech and fir, with fresh green glades rolling down below our\r\nfeet, or emerged from the woods to cross large undulating expanses of\r\nmeadow-land, we were almost inclined to believe that we had never done\r\nso lovely a walk. The scenery through which we passed was thoroughly\r\nthat of the lower districts of the Alps, with nothing Jurane in its\r\ncharacter, and the elevation finally achieved was not very great:\r\nindeed, at a short distance from the glacière, we passed a collection of\r\nvery neat châlets, with gardens and garden-flowers, one of the châlets\r\nrejoicing in countless beehives, with three or four 'ekes' apiece. Up to\r\nthe time of reaching this little village, which seemed to be called\r\nSagnette, our path had been that which leads to _La Brévine_, the\r\nhighest valley in the canton; but now we turned off abruptly up the\r\nsteeper face on the left hand, and in a very few minutes came upon a dry\r\nwilderness of rock and grass, which we at once recognised as 'glacière\r\ncountry;' and when I told our guide that we must be near the place, he\r\nreplied by pointing to the trees round the mouth of the pit.\r\n\r\nShortly after we first left Couvet, a gaunt elderly female, with a\r\none-bullock char, had joined our party, and tried to bully us into\r\ngiving up the cave and going instead to a neighbouring summit, whence\r\nshe promised us a view of unrivalled extent and beauty. She told us that\r\nthere was nothing to be seen in the glacière, and that it was a place\r\nwhere people lost their lives. The guide said that was nonsense; but\r\nshe reduced him to silence by quoting a case in point. She said, too,\r\nthat if a man slipped and fell, there was nothing to prevent him from\r\ngoing helplessly down a run of ice into a subterranean watercourse,\r\nwhich would carry him for two or three leagues underground; and on this\r\nhead our boy had no counter-statement to make. She asserted that without\r\nladders it was utterly impossible to make the descent to the\r\ncommencement of the glacière; and she vowed there was no ladder now, nor\r\nhad been for some time. Here the boy came in, stating that the cave\r\nbelonged to a mademoiselle of Neufchâtel, who had a summer cottage at no\r\ngreat distance, and loved to be supplied with ice during her residence\r\nin the country, for which purpose she kept a sound ladder on the spot,\r\nand had it removed in the winter that it might not be destroyed. There\r\nwas a circumstantial air about this statement which for the moment got\r\nthe better of the old woman; but she speedily recovered herself, and\r\nrepeated positively that there was no ladder of any description, adding,\r\nsomewhat inconsequently, that it was such a bad one, no Christian could\r\nuse it with safety. The boy retorted, that it was all very well for her\r\nto run the glacière down, as she lived near it, but for the world from a\r\ndistance it was a most wonderful sight; and, as for the ladder, he\r\nhappened to know that it was at this time in excellent preservation. The\r\nevent proved that in saying this he drew entirely upon his imagination.\r\nIt is, perhaps, only fair to suppose that they don't mean anything by\r\nit, and it may be mere ignorance on their part; but the simple fact is,\r\nthat some of those Swiss rustics tell the most barefaced lies\r\nconceivable,--_unblushing_ is an epithet that cannot be safely applied\r\nwithout previous soap and water,--and tell them in a plodding systematic\r\nmanner which takes in all but the experienced and wary traveller. I have\r\nmyself learned to suspend my judgment regarding the most simple thing in\r\nnature, until I have other grounds for forming an opinion than the\r\nsolemn asseverations of the most stolid and respectable Swiss, if it so\r\nbe that money depends upon his report.[51]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of two of the glacières already described, the entrance\r\nis by a deep pit, which has the appearance of having been at one time\r\ntwo pits, one less deep than the other; and the barrier between the two\r\nhaving been removed by some natural process, a passage is found down the\r\nsteep side of the shallower pit, which lands the adventurer on a small\r\nsloping shelf, 21 feet sheer above the surface of the snow in the deeper\r\npit, the sides of the latter rising up perpendicularly all round. It is\r\nfor this last 21 feet that some sort of ladder is absolutely necessary.\r\nOur guide flung himself down in the sun at the outer edge of the pit,\r\nand informed us that as it was cold and dangerous down below, he\r\nintended to go no farther: he had engaged, he said, to guide us to the\r\nglacière, and he felt in no way bound to go into it. He was not good for\r\nmuch, so I was not sorry to hear of his determination; and when my\r\nsisters saw the sort of place they had to try to scramble down, they\r\nappeared to be very glad that only I was to be with them.\r\n\r\nLeaving them to make such arrangements with regard to dress as might\r\nseem necessary to them, I proceeded to pioneer the way down the first\r\npart of the descent. This was extremely unpleasant, for the rocks were\r\nsteep and very moist, with treacherous little collections of\r\ndisintegrated material on every small ledge where the foot might\r\notherwise have found a hold. These had to be cleared away before it\r\ncould be safe for them to descend, and in other places the broken rock\r\nhad to be picked out to form foot-holes; while, lower down, where the\r\nfinal shelf was reached, the abrupt slope of mud which ended in the\r\nsheer fall required considerable reduction, being far too beguiling in\r\nits original form. Here there was also a buttress of damp earth to be\r\ngot round, and it was necessary to cut out deep holes for the hands\r\nand feet before even a man could venture upon the attempt with any\r\ncomfort. The buttress was not, however, without its advantage, for on\r\nit, overhanging the snow of the lower pit, was a beautiful clump of\r\ncowslips (_Primula elatior_, Fr. _Primevère inodore_), which was at\r\nonce secured as a trophy. The length of the irregular descent to this\r\npoint was between 70 and 80 feet. On rounding the buttress, the upper\r\nend of the ladder presented itself, and now the question, between the\r\nboy and the old woman was to be decided. I worked down to the edge of\r\nthe shelf, and looked over into the pit, and, alas! the state of the\r\nremaining parts of the ladder was hopeless, owing partly to the decay\r\nof the sidepieces, and partly to the general absence of steps--a\r\nsomewhat embarrassing feature under the circumstances. A further\r\ninvestigation showed that for the 21 feet of ladder there were only\r\nseven steps, and these seven were not arranged as conveniently as they\r\nmight have been, for two occurred at the very top, and the other five\r\nin a group at the bottom. A branchless fir-tree had at some time\r\nfallen into the pit, and now lay in partial contact with the ruined\r\nladder; and there were on the trunk various little knobs, which might\r\npossibly be of some use as a supplement to the rare steps of the\r\nladder. The snow at the bottom of the pit was surrounded on all sides\r\nby perpendicular rock, and on the side opposite to the ladder I saw an\r\narch at the foot of the rock, apparently 2 or 3 feet high, leading\r\nfrom the snow into darkness; and that, of course, was the entrance to\r\nthe glacière. I succeeded in getting down the ladder, by help of the\r\nsupplement, and looked down into the dark hole to see that it was\r\npracticable, and then returned to report progress in the upper\r\nregions. We had brought no alpenstocks to Couvet, so we sent the guide\r\noff into the woods, where we had heard the sound of an axe, to get\r\nthree stout sticks from the woodmen; but he returned with such\r\nwretched, crooked little things, that A. went off herself to forage,\r\nand, having found an impromptu cattle-fence, came back with weapons\r\nresembling bulbous hedge-stakes, which she skinned and generally\r\nmodified with a powerful clasp-knife, her constant companion. She then\r\ncut up the crooked sticks into _bâtons_ for a contemplated repair of\r\nthe ladder, while M. and I investigated the country near the pit. We\r\nfound two other pits, which afterwards proved to communicate with the\r\nglacière. We could approach sufficiently near to one of these to see\r\ndown to the bottom, where there was a considerable collection of snow:\r\nthis pit was completely sheltered from the sun by trees, and was 66\r\nfeet deep and 4 or 5 feet in diameter. The other was of larger size,\r\nbut its edge was so treacherous that we did not venture so near as to\r\nsee what it contained: its depth was about 70 feet, and the stone and\r\na foot or two of the string came up wet. The sides of the main pit, by\r\nwhich we were to enter the glacière, were, as has been said, very\r\nsheer, and on one side we could approach sufficiently near the edge to\r\ndrop a plummet down to the snow: the height of this face of rock was\r\n59 feet, measuring down to the snow, and the level of the ice was\r\neventually found to be about 4 feet lower. Although it was now not\r\nvery far from noon, the sun had not yet reached the snow, owing partly\r\nto the depth of the pit as compared with its diameter, and partly to\r\nthe trees which grew on several sides close to the edge. One or two\r\ntrees of considerable size grew out of the face of rock.\r\n\r\nWe were now cool enough to attempt the glacière, and I commenced the\r\ndescent with A. The precautions already taken made the way tolerably\r\npossible down to the buttress of earth and the shelving ledge, and so\r\nfar the warm sun had accompanied us; but beyond the ledge there was\r\nnothing but the broken ladder, and deep shade, and a cold damp\r\natmosphere, which made the idea, and still more the feel, of snow very\r\nmuch the reverse of pleasant. A. was not a coward on such occasions,\r\nand she had sufficient confidence in her guide; but it is rather\r\ntrying for a lady to make the first step off a slippery slope of mud,\r\non to an apology for a ladder which only stands up a few inches above\r\nthe lower edge of the slope, and so affords no support for the hand:\r\nnor, after all, can bravery and trust quite make up for the want of\r\nsteps. We were a very long time in accomplishing the descent, for her\r\nfeet were always out of her sight, owing to the shape which female\r\ndress assumes when its wearer goes down a ladder with her face to the\r\nfront, especially when the ladder has suffered from ubiquitous\r\ncompound fracture, and the ragged edges catch the unaccustomed\r\npetticoats. It was quite as well the feet were out of sight, for some\r\nof the supports to which they were guided were not such as would have\r\ncommended themselves to her, had she been able to see them. At length,\r\nowing in great measure to the opportune assistance of two of the\r\nbatons we had brought down with us for repairs, thanks also to the\r\ntrunk of the fir-tree, we reached the snow; and poor A. was planted\r\nthere, breaking through the top crust as a commencement of her\r\nacquaintance with it, till such time as I could bring M. down to join\r\nher. The experience acquired in the course of A.'s descent led us to\r\ncall to M. that she must get rid of that portion of her attire which\r\ngives a shape to modern dress; for the obstinacy and power of\r\n_mal-à-propos_ obstructiveness of this garment had wonderfully\r\ncomplicated our difficulties. She objected that the guide was there;\r\nbut we assured her that he was asleep, or if he wasn't it made no\r\nmatter; so when I reached the top, she emerged shapeless from a\r\ntemporary hiding-place, clutching her long hedge-stake, and feeling,\r\nshe said--and certainly looking--a good deal like a gorilla. The most\r\nbaffling part of the trouble having been thus got over, we soon joined\r\nA., blue already, and shivering on the snow. The sun now reached very\r\nnearly to the bottom of the pit, and I went up once more for\r\nthermometers and other things, leaving a measure with my sisters, and\r\nbegging them to amuse themselves by taking the dimensions of the snow:\r\non my return, however, to the top of the ladder, I found them\r\ncombining over a little bottle, and they informed me plaintively that\r\nthey had been taking medicinal brandy and snow instead of\r\nmeasurements,--a very necessary precaution, for anyone to whom brandy\r\nis not a greater nuisance than utter cold. We found the dimensions of\r\nthe bottom of the pit, i.e. of the field of snow on which we stood, to\r\nbe 31-1/2 feet by 21; but we were unable to form any idea of the depth\r\nof the snow, beyond the fact that 'up to the ancle' was its prevailing\r\ncondition. The boy told us, when we rejoined him, that when he and\r\nothers had attempted to get ice for the landlord, when it was ordered\r\nfor him in a serious illness the winter before, they had found the pit\r\nfilled to the top with snow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERTICAL SECTION OF THE GLACIÈRE OF MONTHÉZY, IN THE VAL\r\nDE TRAVERS.]\r\n\r\nAs we stood at the mouth of the low entrance, making final\r\npreparations for a plunge into the darkness, I perceived a strong cold\r\ncurrent blowing out from the cave--sufficiently strong and cold to\r\nrender knickerbocker stockings a very unavailing protection. While\r\nengaged in the discovery that this style of dress is not without its\r\ndrawbacks, I found, to my surprise, that the direction of the current\r\nsuddenly changed, and the cold blast which had before blown out of the\r\ncave, now blew almost as strongly in. The arch of entrance was so low,\r\nthat the top was about on a level with my waist; so that our faces and\r\nthe upper parts of our bodies were not exposed to the current, and the\r\nstrangeness of the effect was thus considerably increased. As a\r\nmatter of curiosity, we lighted a _bougie_, and placed it on the edge\r\nof the snow, at the top of the slope of 3 or 4 feet which led down the\r\nsurface of the ice, and then stood to watch the effect of the current\r\non the flame. The experiment proved that the currents alternated, and,\r\nas I fancied, regularly; and in order to determine, if possible, the\r\nlaw of this alternation, I observed with my watch the exact duration\r\nof each current. For twenty-two seconds the flame of the _bougie_ was\r\nblown away from the entrance, so strongly as to assume a horizontal\r\nposition, and almost to leave the wick: then the current ceased, and\r\nthe flame rose with a stately air to a vertical position, moving down\r\nagain steadily till it became once more horizontal, but now pointing\r\nin towards the cave. This change occupied in all four seconds; and the\r\ncurrent inwards lasted--like the outward current--twenty-two seconds,\r\nand then the whole phenomenon was repeated. The currents kept such\r\ngood time, that when I stood beyond their reach, and turned my back, I\r\nwas enabled to announce each change with perfect precision. On one\r\noccasion, the flame performed its semicircle in a horizontal instead\r\nof a vertical plane, moving round the wick in the shape of a\r\npea-flower. The day was very still, so that no external winds could\r\nhave anything to do with this singular alternation; and, indeed, the\r\npit was so completely sheltered by its shape, that a storm might have\r\nraged outside without producing any perceptible effect below. It would\r\nbe difficult to explain the regularity of these opposite currents, but\r\nit is not so difficult to see that some such oscillation might be\r\nexpected. It will be better, however, to defer any suggestions on this\r\npoint till the glacière has been more fully described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUND PLAN OF THE GLACIÈRE OF MONTHÉZY. Note: The\r\ncandle stood at this point.]\r\n\r\nWe passed down at length through the low archway, and stood on the floor\r\nof ice. As our eyes became accustomed to the darkness, we saw that an\r\nindistinct light streamed into the cave from some low point at a\r\nconsiderable distance, apparently on a level with the floor; and this we\r\nafterwards found to be the bottom of the larger of the two pits we had\r\nalready fathomed, the pit A of the diagram; and we eventually discovered\r\na similar but much smaller communication with the bottom of the pit B.\r\nIn each of these pits there was a considerable pyramid of snow, whose\r\nbase was on a level with the floor of the glacière: the connecting\r\narchway in the case of the pit A was 3 or 4 feet high, allowing us to\r\npass into the pit and round the pyramid with perfect ease, while that\r\nleading to the pit B was less than a foot high, so that no passage could\r\nbe forced.\r\n\r\nAs we stood on the ice at the entrance and peered into the comparative\r\ndarkness, we saw by degrees that the glacière consisted of a continuous\r\nsea of smooth ice, sloping down very gently towards the right hand. The\r\nrock which forms the roof of the cave seemed to be almost as even as the\r\nfloor, and was from 4 to 5 feet high in the neighbourhood in which we\r\nnow found ourselves, gradually approaching the floor towards the bottom\r\nof the pit B, where it became about a foot high, and rising slightly in\r\nthat part of the cave where the floor fell, so as to give 9 or 10 feet\r\nas the height there. The ice had all the appearance of great depth; but\r\nthere were no means of forming a trustworthy opinion on this point,\r\nbeyond the fact that I succeeded in lowering a stone to a considerable\r\ndepth, in the small crevice which existed between the wall and the block\r\nof ice which formed the floor. The greatest length of the cave we found\r\nto be 112 ft. 7 in., and its breadth 94 ft., the general shape of the\r\nfield of ice, which filled it to its utmost edges, being elliptical. The\r\nsurface was unpleasantly wet, chiefly in the line of the currents, which\r\nwere now seen to pass backwards and forwards between the pits A and C.\r\nIn the neighbourhood of the pit B the water stood in a very thin sheet\r\non the ice, which there was level, and rendered the style of locomotion\r\nnecessitated by the near approach of the roof extremely disagreeable, as\r\nI was obliged to lie on my face, and push myself along the wet and\r\nslippery ice, to explore that corner of the cave, being at length\r\nstopped by want of sufficient height for even that method of\r\nprogression.\r\n\r\nThe circle marked D represents a column from the roof, at the foot of\r\nwhich we found a small grotto in the ice, which I entered to a depth of\r\n6 feet, the surface of the field of ice showing a very gracefully\r\nrounded fall at the edges of the grotto. At the point E there was a\r\nbeautiful collection of fretted columns, white and hard as porcelain,\r\narranged in a semicircle, with the diameter facing the cave, measuring\r\n22 ft. 9 in. along this face. On the farther side of these columns there\r\nwere signs of a considerable fall in the ice; and by making use of the\r\nroots of small stalagmitic columns of that material, which grew on the\r\nslope of ice, I got down into a little wilderness of spires and\r\nflutings, and found a small cave penetrating a short way under the solid\r\nice-floor. G marks the place of a free stalagmite of ice, formed under a\r\nfissure in the roof; and each F represents a column from the roof, or\r\nfrom a lateral fissure in the wall.\r\n\r\nThe most striking features of this cave were the three domes, marked H\r\nin the ground-plan, in which they ought strictly not to appear, as being\r\nconfined to the roof: one of them is shown also in the vertical section\r\nof the cave. They occur where the roof is from 3 to 4 feet above the\r\nfloor. It will be understood, that the bent attitude in which we were\r\nobliged to investigate these parts of the cave was exceedingly\r\nfatiguing, and we hailed with delight a sudden circular opening in the\r\nroof which enabled us to stand upright. This delight was immensely\r\nincreased when our candles showed us that the walls of this vertical\r\nopening were profusely decorated with the most lovely forms of ice. The\r\nfirst that we came under passed up out of sight; and in this, two solid\r\ncascades of ice hung down, high overhead, apparently broken off short,\r\nor at any rate ending very abruptly: the others did not pass so far\r\ninto the roof, and formed domes of very regular shape. In all three, the\r\ndetails of the ice-decoration were most lovely, and the effect produced\r\nby the whole situation was very curious; for we stood with our legs\r\nexposed to the alternating cold currents, the remaining part of our\r\nbodies being imbedded as it were in the roof; while the candles in our\r\nhands brought out the crystal ornaments of the sides, flashing fitfully\r\nall round us and overhead, when one or other of us moved a light, as if\r\nwe had been surrounded by diamonds of every possible size and setting.\r\nOne of the domes was so small, that we were obliged to stand up by turn\r\nto examine its beauties; but in the others we all stood together. On\r\nevery side were branching clusters of ice in the form of club-mosses,\r\nwith here and there varicose veins of clear ice, and pinnacles of the\r\nprismatic structure, with limpid crockets and finials. The pipes of ice\r\nwhich formed a network on the walls were in some cases so exquisitely\r\nclear, that we could not be sure of their existence without touching\r\nthem; and in other cases a sheet 4 or 6 inches thick was found to be no\r\nobstruction to our view of the rock on which it was formed. In one of\r\nthe domes we had only one candle, and the bearer of this after a time\r\ncontrived to let it fall, leaving us standing with our heads in perfect\r\ndarkness; while the indistinct light which strayed about our feet showed\r\nfaintly a circle of icicles, hanging from the lower part of the dome,\r\nthe fringe, as it were, of our rocky petticoats.\r\n\r\nIn one of the lower parts of the cave, where darkness prevailed, and\r\nlocomotion was only possible on the lowest reptile principles, M.\r\nannounced that she could see clear through the ice-floor, as if there\r\nwere nothing between her and the rock below. I ventured to doubt this,\r\nfor there was an air of immense thickness about the whole ice; and as\r\nsoon as A. and I had succeeded in grovelling across the intervening\r\nspace, and converged upon her, we found that the appearance she had\r\nobserved was due to a most perfect reflection of the roof, as shown by\r\nthe candles we carried, which may give some idea of the character of the\r\nice. We did not care to study this effect for any very prolonged time,\r\ninasmuch as we were obliged meanwhile to stow away the length of our\r\nlegs on a part of the ice which was thinly covered with water,--one\r\nresult of its proximity to the arch communicating with the smallest pit.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the whole ice-floor sloped slightly towards one\r\nside of the cave, the slope becoming rather more steep near the edge.[52]\r\nClearly, ever so slight a slope would be sufficiently embarrassing, when\r\nthe surface was so perfectly smooth and slippery; and this added much to\r\nthe difficulty of walking in a bent attitude. On coming out of one of\r\nthe domes, I tried progression on all-fours--threes, rather, for the\r\ncandle occupied one hand,--and I cannot recommend that method, owing to\r\nthe impossibility of putting on the break. The pace ultimately acquired\r\nis greater than is pleasant, and the roof is too near the floor to allow\r\nof any successful attempt to bring things to an end by the reassumption\r\nof a biped character.\r\n\r\nWe placed a thermometer in the line of greatest current, and another in\r\na still part of the cave. The memorandum is lost of their register--if,\r\nindeed, we ever made one, for we were more concerned with the beauties\r\nthan the temperature was surprisingly high in the line of current, as\r\ncompared with the ordinary temperature of ice-caves.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to compare backs, after leaving the cave, we mutually found\r\nthat they were in a very disreputable condition. The damp and ragged\r\nroof with which they had been so frequently in contact had produced a\r\nmarked effect upon them, and I eventually paid a tailor in Geneva three\r\nfrancs for restoring my coat to decency. M. took great credit to herself\r\nfor having been more careful of her back than the others, and declined\r\nto be laughed at for forgetting that she was only about half as high as\r\nthey, to begin with. A. still remembers the green-grey stains, as the\r\nmost obstinate she ever had to deal with, especially as her three-days'\r\nknapsack contained no change for that outer part of her dress.\r\n\r\nThe 'Ecu' gave us a charming dinner on our return; then a moderate bill,\r\nand an affectionate farewell; and we succeeded in catching the early\r\nevening train for Pontarlier.[53]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: _Aigue_, or _egue_, in the patois of this district, is\r\nequivalent to _eau_, the Latin _aqua_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Ebel, in his _Swiss Manual_ (French translation of 1818,\r\nt. iii.), mentions this glacière under the head _Motiers_, and observes\r\nthat it and the grotto of S. Georges are the only places in the Jura\r\nwhere ice remains through the summer. This statement, in common with a\r\ngreat part of Ebel, has been transferred to the letterpress of\r\n_Switzerland Illustrated_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Switzerland sent 7,500,000 gallons of absinthe to France\r\nin 1864.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: _Point d'argent, point de Suisse_, is a proverbial\r\nexpression which the Swiss twist into a historical compliment, asserting\r\nthat it arose in early mercenary times, from the fact that they were too\r\nvirtuous to accept the suggestion of the general who hired them, and\r\nwished them to take their pay in kind from the defenceless people of the\r\ncountry they had served.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: It is probable that the ice is on the increase in this\r\nglacière, and that an archway, now filled up by the growing ice, has at\r\none time existed in the wall on this side of the care, through which the\r\nice and water used to pour into the subterranean depths of which the old\r\nwoman had told us. At the time of our visit, we could find no outlet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: The following remarks may give some explanation of the\r\nphenomenon of alternating currents in this cave, I should suppose that\r\nduring the night there is atmospheric equilibrium in the cave itself,\r\nand in the three pits A, B, C. When the heat of the sun comes into\r\noperation, the three pits are very differently affected by it, C being\r\ncomparatively open to the sun's rays, while A is much less so, and B is\r\nentirely sheltered from radiation. This leads naturally to atmospheric\r\ndisturbance. The air in the pit C is made warmer and less heavy than\r\nthat in A and B, and the consequence is, that the column of air in C can\r\nno longer balance the columns in A and B, which therefore begin to\r\ndescend, and so a current of air is driven from the cave into the pit C.\r\nOwing to the elasticity of the atmosphere, even at a low temperature,\r\nthis descent, and the consequent rush of air into C, will be overdone,\r\nand a recoil must take place, which accounts for the return current into\r\nthe cave from the pit C. The sun can reach A more easily than B, and\r\nthus the air is lighter and more moveable in the former pit, so that the\r\nrecoil will make itself more felt in A than in B: accordingly, we found\r\nthat the main currents alternated between A and C, with very slight\r\ndisturbance in the neighbourhood of B. B will, however, play its part,\r\nand the weighty column of air contained in it will oscillate, though\r\nwith smaller oscillations than in the case of A. Probably, when the sun\r\nhas left A, while acting still upon C, the return current from C will be\r\nmuch slighter, and there will be a general settling of the atmosphere in\r\nthe pits A and B, until C also is freed from the sun's action, when the\r\nwhole system will gradually pass into a state of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the action of the more protected pits, the principle of\r\nthe hydraulic ram not unnaturally suggests itself.\r\n\r\nIn considering the minor details of the currents, such elements as the\r\nrefrigeration of the air in its passage across the face of the ice must\r\nbe taken into account. It may be observed that the candle did not occupy\r\nan _intermediate_ position with respect to two opposing currents, for it\r\nwas practically on the floor of the cave, owing to the continuity of the\r\nslope of snow on which it stood, as shown in the vertical section on p.\r\n108.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE AND NEIGIÈRE OF ARC-SOUS-CICON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beauties of the Val de Travers end only with the valley itself, at\r\nthe head of which a long tunnel ushers the traveller into a tamer\r\ncountry,--a preparation, as it were, for France. After the border is\r\npassed, the scenery begins to improve again, and the effect of the two\r\ncastles of Joux, the new and the old, crowning the heights on either\r\nside of the narrow gorge through which the railway runs, is very fine.\r\nThe guide-books inform us that the Château of Joux was the place of\r\nimprisonment of the unfortunate Toussaint L'Ouverture, and that there he\r\ndied of neglect and cold; and it was in the same strong fortress that\r\nMirabeau was confined by his father's desire. The old castle, however,\r\nis more interesting from its connection with the history of Charles the\r\nBold, who retired to La Rivière after the battle of Morat, and spent\r\nhere those sad solitary weeks of which Philip de Comines tells with so\r\nmany moral reflections; weeks of bodily and mental distress, which left\r\nhim a mere wreck, and led to his wild want of generalship and his\r\nmiserable death at Nancy. He had melted down the church-bells in this\r\npart of Burgundy and Vaud, to make cannon for the final effort which\r\nfailed so fatally at Morat; and the old chroniclers relate--without any\r\nallusion to the sacrilege--that the artillery was wretchedly served on\r\nthat cruel[54] day. It is some comfort to Englishmen to know that their\r\nancestors under the Duke of Somerset displayed a marvellous courage on\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\nWe reached Pontarlier in time for a stroll through the quiet town; but\r\nwe searched in vain for the tempting convents and gates, which were\r\nmarked on my copy of an old plan of the place, dedicated to the Prince\r\nd'Arenberg, in the well-known times when he governed the Franche\r\nComté. The convents had become for the most part breweries, and the\r\ngates had been improved away. Our enquiries respecting the place of\r\nour destination were fortunately more successful. The idea of a\r\nglacière was new to the world of Pontarlier; but the landlord of the\r\nHôtel National had heard of Arc-sous-Cicon, and had no doubt that we\r\ncould find a carriage of some sort to take us there. His own horses\r\nwere all engaged in haymaking, but his neighbours' horses might be\r\nless busy, and accordingly he took us first to call upon M. Paget, a\r\nfriend who added to his income by keeping a horse and voiture for\r\nhire. The Pagets in general had gone to bed, and the door was\r\nfastened; but our guide seemed to know the ways of the house, and we\r\nfound Madame in the stables, and arranged with her for a carriage at\r\nseven o'clock the next morning.\r\n\r\nAt the time appointed, M. Paget did not come, and I was obliged to go\r\nand look him up. He proved to me that it was all right, somehow, and\r\nevidently understood that his convenience, not ours, was the thing to be\r\nconsulted. The hotel is in a narrow street, and, apparently on that\r\naccount, a stray passer-by was caught, and pressed into M. Paget's\r\nservice to help to turn the carriage,--a feat accomplished by a bodily\r\nlifting of the hinder part, with its wheels. After-experience showed\r\nthat the narrowness of the street had nothing to with it, and we\r\ndiscovered that the necessity for the manoeuvre was due to a chronic\r\naffection of some portion of the voiture; so that whenever in the course\r\nof the day it became necessary for us to turn round, M. Paget was\r\nconstrained to call in foreign help.\r\n\r\nThe country through which we passed was uninteresting in the extreme,\r\nalthough we had been told by the landlord that our drive would introduce\r\nus to a succession of natural beauties such as few countries in the\r\nworld could show. The line of hills, at the foot of which we expected\r\nour route to lie, looked exceedingly tempting as seen from Pontarlier;\r\nbut, to our disappointment, we left the hills and struck across the\r\nplain. About ten or eleven kilomètres from Pontarlier, however, the\r\ncharacter of the country changed suddenly, and we found the landlord's\r\npromise in some part fulfilled. Rich meadow-slopes were broken by\r\nsolitary trees arranged in Nature's happiest style, and grey precipices\r\nof Jurane grimness and perpendicularity encroached upon the woods and\r\ngrass. We were coming near the source of the Loue, M. Paget said, which\r\nit would be necessary for us to visit. He told us that we must leave the\r\ncarriage at an _auberge_ on the roadside, and walk to the neighbouring\r\nvillage of Ouhans, which was inaccessible for voitures, and thence we\r\nshould easily find our way to the source. The distance, he declared, was\r\ntwenty minutes. The woman at the _auberge_ strongly recommended the\r\nsource, but did her best to dissuade us from the glacières, of which she\r\nsaid there were two. She had visited them herself, and told her husband,\r\nwho had guided her, that there was nothing to see. That, we thought,\r\nproved nothing against the glacières, and her dulness of appreciation we\r\nwere willing to accept without further proof than her personal\r\nappearance. Besides, to go to the source, and not to Arc, would mean\r\ndining with her; so that she was not an impartial adviser.\r\n\r\nM. Paget was a short square man, of very few words, and his one object\r\nin life seemed to be to save his black horse as much as possible; a\r\nvery creditable object in itself, so long as he did not go too far in\r\nhis endeavours to accomplish it. On the present occasion he certainly\r\ndid go too far. The road was quite as good as that which we had left,\r\nand there was no reason in the world why the carriage should not have\r\ntaken us to the village. Worse still, we discovered eventually that\r\nthe 'twenty minutes' meant twenty minutes from the village to the\r\nsource, and represented really something like half the time necessary\r\nfor that part of the march, while there was a hot and dusty walk of\r\nhalf an hour before we reached the village. As he accompanied us in\r\nperson, we had the satisfaction of frequently telling him our mind\r\nwith insular frankness. He pretended to be much distressed, but\r\nassured us each time we returned to the charge--about every quarter of\r\nan hour--that we were close to the desired spot. From the village to\r\nthe source, the way led us through such pleasant scenery and such\r\nacceptable strawberries, that we only kept up our periodical\r\nremonstrances on principle, and, after we had wound rapidly down\r\nthrough a grand defile, and turned a sudden angle of the rock, the\r\nfirst sight of that which we had come to see amply repaid us all the\r\ntrouble we had gone through. The source of the Orbe is sufficiently\r\nstriking, but the Loue is by far more grand at the moment of its\r\nbirth. The former is a bright fairy-like stream, gushing out of a\r\nsmall cavern at the foot of a lofty precipice clothed with clinging\r\ntrees; but the Loue flows out from the bottom of an amphitheatrical\r\nrock much more lofty and unbroken. The stream itself is broader and\r\ndeeper, and glides with an infinitely more majestic calmness from a\r\nvast archway in the rock, into the recesses of which the eye can\r\npenetrate to the point where the roof closes in upon the water, and so\r\ncuts off all further view. The calmness of the flow may be in part\r\nattributed to a weir, which has been built across the stream at the\r\nmouth of the cave, for the purpose of driving a portion of the water\r\ninto a channel which conveys it to various mill-wheels; for, at a very\r\nshort distance below the weir, the natural stream makes a fall of 17\r\nfeet, so that, if left to itself, it might probably rush out more\r\nimpetuously from its mysterious cavern. The weir is a single timber,\r\nbelow the surface, fixed obliquely across the stream on a shelving\r\nbank of masonry, and the farther end meets the wall of rock inside the\r\ncave. Near it we saw some glorious hart's-tongue ferns, which excited\r\nour desires, and I took off boots and stockings, and endeavoured to\r\nmake my way along the weir; but the face of the masonry was so very\r\nslippery, and the nails in the timber so unpleasant for bare feet, and\r\nthe stream was so unexpectedly strong, that I called to mind the\r\nproverbial definition of the better part of valour, and came back\r\nwithout having achieved the ferns. The biting coldness of the water,\r\nand the boiling of the fall close below the weir, did not add to my\r\nconfidence in making the attempt, but I should think that in a more\r\nfavourable state of the water the cave might be very well explored by\r\ntwo men going alone. The day penetrated so completely into the\r\nfarthest corners, that when I got half-way along the weir, I could\r\ndetect the oily look on the surface where it first saw the light,\r\nwhich showed where the water was quietly streaming up from its unknown\r\nsources. The people in the neighbourhood were unable to suggest any\r\nlake or lakes of which this river might be the subterranean drainage.\r\nIt is liable to sudden and violent overflows, which seldom last more\r\nthan twenty-four hours; and from the destruction of property caused by\r\nthese outbursts, the name of _La Loue_, sc. _La Louve_, has been given\r\nto it. The rocky valley through which the river runs, after leaving\r\nits underground channel, is exceedingly fine, and we wandered along\r\nthe precipices on one side, enjoying the varying scenes so much that\r\nwe could scarcely bring ourselves to turn; each bend of the fretting\r\nriver showing a narrow gorge in the rock, with a black rapid, and a\r\nfoaming fall. It is said that although the mills on the Doubs are\r\nsometimes stopped from want of water, those which derive their motive\r\npower from this strange and impressive cavern have never known the\r\nsupply to fail.\r\n\r\nBefore we started for our ramble among the woods and precipices which\r\noverhang the farther course of the Loue, we had sent off M. Paget to the\r\n_auberge_, with strict orders that he should at once get out the black\r\nhorse, and bring the carriage to meet us at Ouhans, as one of us was not\r\nin so good order for walking as usual, and the day was fast slipping\r\naway. Of course we saw nothing of him when we reached Ouhans; and as it\r\nwas not prudent to wait for his arrival there, which might never take\r\nplace, we walked through the broiling sun in the direction of the\r\n_auberge_, and at last saw him coming, pretending to whip his horse as\r\nif he were in earnest about the pace. We somewhat sullenly assisted him\r\nto turn the old carriage round, and then bade him drive as hard as he\r\ncould to Arc-sous-Cicon, still a long way off. This he said he would do\r\nif he knew which was the way; but since he was last there, as a much\r\nyounger man, there had been a general change in the matter of roads, and\r\nhow the new ones lay he did not know. This was not cheerful\r\nintelligence, especially as we had set our hearts upon getting back to\r\nPontarlier in time for the evening train, which would give us a night at\r\nthe charming _Bellevue_ at Neufchâtel, instead of the poisonous coffee\r\nand the trying odours of the _National_: the old man's instinct,\r\nhowever, led him right, and we reached Arc at half-past twelve. One\r\nobstacle to our journey on the new road promised at first to be\r\ninsurmountable, being an immense _sapin_, the largest I have seen\r\nfelled, which lay on a combination of wood-chairs straight across the\r\nroad. It had been brought down a narrow side-road through a wheat-field,\r\nand one end occupied this road, while the other was jammed against the\r\nwall on the opposite side of the main road; and half-a-dozen men, with\r\nas many draught oxen, were mainly endeavouring to turn it in the right\r\ndirection. M. Paget knew how much was required to turn his own carriage,\r\nand he calculated that the road would not be free for two or three\r\nhours, which involved a rest for his black horse, a pipe for himself,\r\nand, possibly, a short sleep. The oxen were lazy, and their hides\r\nimpervious; the whips were cracked in vain, and in vain were brought\r\nmore directly to bear upon the senses of the recusants; the men howled,\r\nand rattled the chains, and re-arranged the clumsy head-gear, but all to\r\nno purpose. The man who did most of the howling was a black Burgundian\r\ndwarf, in a long blouse and moustaches; and he did it in so frightful a\r\npatois, that the oxen were right in their refusal to understand. We\r\nrepresented to M. Paget that it would be possible to make our way\r\nthrough the wheat; but he declared himself perfectly happy where he was,\r\nand declined to take any steps in the matter; whereupon I assumed the\r\ncommand of the expedition, and led the horse through the corn, thus\r\nturning the flank of the _sapin_ and its attendants. Our driver\r\nsubmitted to this act of violence much as a member of the Society of\r\nFriends allows a chamberlain to remove his hat from behind when he is\r\nfavoured with an audience of the sovereign; and when we regained the\r\nhigh road, he meekly took up the reins and drove us at a good pace to\r\nArc.\r\n\r\nThe village lies in a curiously open plain, with a girdle of hills, in\r\none of which the glacières were supposed to lie. The first _auberge_\r\nrefused us admittance, on the ground that the dinner was all\r\npre-engaged, and the result was that we found a pleasanter place higher\r\nup the village, near a vast new _maison de ville_ with every window\r\nshattered by recent hail. The people groaned over the unnecessary\r\nexpense of this huge building, which might well, from its size, have\r\nbeen a home for the whole village; and they told us that the communal\r\nforests had been terribly over-cut to provide the money for it. Our\r\nfirst demand was for food; our next, for a guide to the glacières. Food\r\nwe could have; but why _should_ we wish to go to the glacières, when\r\nthere was so much else worth seeing at a little distance?--a guide might\r\nwithout doubt be found, but there was nothing to be seen when we got\r\nthere. We ordered prompt dinner, anything that happened to be ready, and\r\ndesired the landlord to look out for a man to show us the way up the\r\nhills. When the dinner came, it was cold; and the main dish consisted\r\napparently of something which had made stock for many generations of\r\nsoup, and had then been kept in a half-warm state, ready to be heated\r\nfor any passer-by who called for hot meat, till the cook had despaired\r\nof its ever being used, and had allowed it to become cold: at least, no\r\nother supposition seemed to account for its utter want of flavour, and\r\nthe wonderful development of its fibres. As a matter of politeness, I\r\nasked the man what it was; when he took the dish from the table, smelled\r\nat it, and pronounced it veal.\r\n\r\nThere were also several specimens of the original old turnip-radish,\r\nwith large shrubs of heads, and mature feelers many inches long. As all\r\nthis was not very inviting, we ordered an omelette and some cheese; and\r\nwhen the omelette came, we found that the cook had combined our ideas\r\nand understood our order to mean a cheese-omelette, which was not so bad\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the landlord's visit to his drinking-room had procured a\r\nman willing to act as our guide. He was, unfortunately, more willing\r\nthan able; for his sojourn in the drinking-room had told upon his\r\npowers of equilibrium. He asserted, as every one seemed in all cases\r\nto assert, that neither rope nor axe was in any way necessary. When I\r\npressed the rope, he said that if monsieur was afraid he had better\r\nnot go; so we told the landlord privately that the man was rather too\r\ndrunk for a guide, and we must have another. The landlord thereupon\r\noffered himself, at the suggestion of his wife, who seemed to be the\r\nchief partner in the firm, and we were glad to accept his offer; while\r\nthe incapacitated man whom we had rejected acquiesced in the new\r\narrangement with a bow so little withering, and with such genuine\r\npoliteness, that, in spite of his over-much wine, he won my heart. The\r\nlandlord himself did not profess to know the glacières; but he knew\r\nthe man who lived nearest to them, and proposed to lead us to his\r\nfriend's châlet, whence we should doubtless be able to find a guide.\r\n\r\nWe stole a few moments for an inspection of the Church of Arc, and\r\nfound, to our surprise, some very pleasing paintings in good repair, and\r\nopen sittings which looked unusually clean and neat. Then we crossed the\r\nplain towards the north, and proceeded to grapple with a stiff path\r\nthrough the woods which climb the first hills. It turned out that there\r\nwas no one available for our purpose in the châlet to which the landlord\r\nled us; but a small child was despatched in search of the master or the\r\ndomestic, and returned before long with the latter individual, who\r\nreceived the mistress's instruction respecting the route, and received\r\nalso an axe which I had begged in case of need. The accounts we had\r\nheard of the glacière or glacières--every one declined to call them\r\ncaves--were so various, and the total denials of their existence so\r\nmany, that we quietly made up our minds to disappointment, and agreed\r\nthat what we had seen at the source of the Loue was quite sufficient to\r\nrepay us for the trouble we had taken; while the idea of a rapid raid\r\ninto France had something attractive in it, which more than\r\ncounterbalanced the old charms of Soleure. Besides, we found that we\r\nwere now in a good district for flowers, and the abundant _Gnaphalium\r\nsylvaticum_ brought back to our minds many a delightful scramble in\r\nglacier regions, where its lovely velvet kinsman the _pied-de-lion_\r\ngrows. On the broad top of the range of hills, covered with rich grass,\r\nwe came upon large patches of a plant, with scented leaves and pungent\r\nseeds, which we had not known before, _Meum athamanticum_, and, to\r\nplease our guide, we went through the form of pretending that we rather\r\nliked its taste. My sisters were in ecstasies of triumph over a wild\r\neverlasting-pea, which grew here to a considerable height--_Lathyrus\r\nsylvestris_, they said, Fr. _Gesse sauvage_, distinct from _G.\r\nhétéropyhlle,_ which is still larger, and is almost confined to a\r\nfavourite place of sojourn with us, the little Swiss valley of Les\r\nPlans. It is said that on the top of these hills springs of water rise\r\nto the surface, though there is no higher ground in the neighbourhood; a\r\nphenomenon which has been accounted for by the supposition of a\r\ndifference of specific gravity between these springs and the waters\r\nwhich drive them up.\r\n\r\nThe character of the ground on the plateau changed suddenly, and we\r\npassed at one step, apparently, from a meadow of flowers to a wilderness\r\nof fissured rock, lying white and skeleton-like in the afternoon sun. We\r\nonly skirted this rock in the first instance, and made for a clump of\r\ntrees some little way off, in which we found a deep pit, with a path of\r\nsufficient steepness leading to the bottom. Here we came to a collection\r\nof snow, much sheltered by overhanging rocks and trees; and this, our\r\nguide told us, was the _neigière_, a word evidently formed on the same\r\nprinciple as _glacière_. The snow was half-covered with leaves, and was\r\nunpleasantly wet to our feet, so that we did not spend much time on it,\r\nor rather in it. A huge fragment of rock had at some time or other\r\nfallen from overhead, and now occupied a large part of the sloping\r\nbottom of the pit: by squeezing myself through a narrow crevice between\r\nthis and the live rock, which looked as if it ought to lead to\r\nsomething, I found a veritable ice-cave, unhappily free from ornament,\r\nand of very small size, like a round soldier's tent in shape, with walls\r\nof rock and floor of ice. We afterwards found an easier entrance to the\r\ncave; but the floor was so wet, and the constant drops of water from the\r\nroof so little agreeable, that we got out again as soon as possible,\r\nespecially as this was not the glacière we had come to see.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the surface once more, the landlord and the domestic\r\nboth assured us that the _neigière_ was the great sight, the glacière\r\nbeing nothing at all, but, such as it was, they would lead us to it.\r\nThey took us to the fissured rock mentioned above; and when we looked\r\ndown into the fissures, we saw that some of them were filled at the\r\nbottom with ice. They were not the ordinary fissures, like the crevasses\r\nof a glacier, but rather disconnected slits in the surface, opening into\r\nlarger chambers in the heart of the rock, where the ice lay. In one part\r\nof this curious district the surface sank considerably, and showed\r\nnothing but a tumbled collection of large stones and rocks, piled in a\r\nmost disorderly manner. By examining the neighbourhood of the larger of\r\nthese rocks, we found a burrow, down which one of the men and I made our\r\nway, and thus, after some windings in the interior, reached a point from\r\nwhich we could descend to the ice. The impression conveyed to my mind\r\nby the whole appearance of the rock and ice was not unlike that of the\r\ndomes in the Glacière of Monthézy; only that now the lower part of the\r\ndome was filled with ice, and we stood in the upper part. There were two\r\nor three of these domes, communicating one with another, and in all I\r\nfound abundant signs of the prismatic structure, though no columns or\r\nwall-decoration remained. My sisters were accomplished in the art of\r\nburrowing, but they did not care to come down, and we soon rejoined\r\nthem, spending a little time in letting down lighted _bougies_ into the\r\nvarious domes and fissures, in order to study the movements of the air,\r\nbut our experiments did not lead to much.\r\n\r\nThe landlord had evidently not believed in the existence of ice in\r\nsummer, and his first thought was to take some home to his wife, to\r\nprove that we had reached the glacière and had found ice: such at least\r\nwere the reasons he gave, but evidently his soul was imbued with a deep\r\nobedience to that better half, and the offering of a block of ice was\r\nsuggested by a complication of feelings. When we reached the _auberge_\r\nagain, we found the rejected guide still there, and more unstable than\r\nbefore. The general impression on his mind seemed to be that he had been\r\nwronged, and had forgiven us. In our absence he had been meditating upon\r\nthe glacière, and his imagination had brought him to a very exalted idea\r\nof its wonders. Whereas, in the former part of the day, he had stoutly\r\nasserted that no cord could possibly be necessary, he now vehemently\r\naffirmed that if I had but taken him as guide, he would have let me down\r\ninto holes 40 mètres deep, where I should have seen such things as man\r\nhad never seen before. Had monsieur seen the source of the Loue? Yes,\r\nmonsieur had. Very fine, was it not? Yes, very fine. Which did monsieur\r\nthen prefer--the glacière, or the source? The source, infinitely. _Then_\r\nit was clear monsieur had not seen the glacière:--he was sure before\r\nthat monsieur had not, _now_ it was quite clear, for in all the world\r\nthere was nothing like that glacière. The Loue!--one might rather see\r\nthe glacière once, than live by the source of the Loue all the days of\r\none's life.\r\n\r\nIt was now five o'clock, and the train left Pontarlier at half-past\r\nseven. We represented to M. Paget that he really ought to do the twenty\r\nkilomètres in two hours and a quarter, which would leave us a quarter of\r\nan hour to arrange our knapsacks and pay the _National_. He promised to\r\ndo his best, and certainly the black horse proved himself a most willing\r\nbeast. There was one long hill which damped our spirits, and made us\r\ngive up the idea of catching the train; and here our driver came to the\r\nrescue with what sounded at first like a promising story--the only one\r\nwe extracted from him all through the day--_à propos_ of a\r\nmemorial-stone on the road-side, where a man had lately been killed by\r\ntwo bears; but, when we came to examine into it, the romance vanished,\r\nfor the man was a brewer's waggoner with a dray of beer, and the bears\r\nwere tame bears, led in a string, which frightened the brewer's horses,\r\nand so the man was killed. Contrary to our expectations and fears, we\r\ndid catch the train, and arrived in a thankful frame of mind at\r\ncomfortable quarters in Neufchâtel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _Cruel comme à Morat_ was long a popular saying.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHAFLOCH, OR TROU-AUX-MOUTONS, NEAR THE LAKE OF THUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, my sisters went one way and I another; they to a\r\nvalley in the south-west of Vaud, where our head-quarters were to be\r\nestablished for some weeks, and I to Soleure, where a Swiss _savant_ had\r\nvaguely told us he believed there was a glacière to be seen. That town,\r\nhowever, denied the existence of any approach to such a thing, with a\r\nunanimity which in itself was suspicious, and with a want of imagination\r\nwhich I had not expected to find. One man I really thought might be\r\npersuaded to know of some cave where there was or might be ice, but\r\nafter a quarter of an hour's discussion he finally became immovable on\r\nthe negative side. A Frenchman would certainly have been polite enough\r\nto accommodate facts to my desires. It was all the more annoying,\r\nbecause the Weissenstein stood overhead so engagingly, and I should have\r\nbeen only too glad to spend the night in the hotel there, if anyone had\r\ngiven me the slightest encouragement. I specially pointed at the\r\nneighbourhood of this hotel to my doubtful friend, as being likely for\r\ncaves; but he was not in the pay of the landlord, and so failed to take\r\nthe hint. There is a curious hole in which ice is found near\r\nWeissenstein in Carniola,[55] and it is not impossible that this may\r\nhave originated the idea of a glacière near Soleure.\r\n\r\nThe Schweizerhof at Berne is a very comfortable resting-place; but, in\r\nspite of its various excellences, if a tired traveller is told that No.\r\n53 is to be his room, he will do well to seek a bed elsewhere. No. 53 is\r\na sort of closet to some other number, with a single window opening low\r\non to the passage, and is adjudged to the unfortunate individual who\r\narrives at that omnipresent crisis which raises the charge for\r\nbed-rooms, and silences all objections to their want of comfort--namely,\r\nwhen there is only one bed left in the house. In itself, No. 53 would be\r\nwell enough; but the throne of the chambermaid is in the passage, by the\r\nside of the window, and the male attendant on that particular stage\r\nnaturally gravitates to the same point, when the bells of the stage do\r\nnot summon him elsewhere, and often enough when they do. This\r\ncombination leads of course to local disturbances of a somewhat noisy\r\ncharacter, and however entirely a sleepy man may in principle sympathise\r\nwith the causes of the noise, it becomes rather hard to bear after\r\nmidnight. The precise actors on the present occasion have, no doubt,\r\nquarrelled or set up a _café_ before now, or perhaps have achieved both\r\nresults by taking the latter first; but there is reason to believe that\r\nso long as the window of No. 53 is the seat of the chambermaid for the\r\ntime being, so long will that room be--as the landlord neatly expressed\r\nit when a protest was made--_etwas unruhig_.\r\n\r\nAll Switzerland has been playing at soldiers for some time, and as we\r\nleft Berne the next morning, we saw three or four hundred Federal men of\r\nwar marching down the road which runs parallel with the rails. The three\r\nofficers at the head of the column were elderly and stout; moreover,\r\nthey were mounted, and that fact was evidently due rather to the\r\nmeekness of their chargers than to the grip of their own legs. When they\r\nsaw the train coming, they took prompt measures. They halted the troops,\r\nand rode off down a side lane to be out of harm's way; and when we had\r\nwell passed, they rejoined the column, and the march was resumed.\r\n\r\nThe early train from Berne catches the first boat on the Lake of Thun,\r\nand I landed at the second station on the lake, the village of Gonten or\r\nGunten. M. Thury's list states that the glacière known as the Schafloch\r\nis on the Rothhorn, in the Canton of Berne, 4,500 mètres of horizontal\r\ndistance from Merligen, a village on the shore of the lake; and from\r\nthese data I was to find the cave. Gonten was apparently the nearest\r\nstation to Merligen, and as soon as the small boat which meets the\r\nsteamer had deposited me on the shore, I asked my way, first to the\r\n_auberge_, and then to Merligen. The _auberge_ was soon found, and\r\ncoffee and bread were at once ordered for breakfast; but when the people\r\nlearned my eventual destination, they would not let me go to Merligen. A\r\nman, to whom--for no particular reason--I had given two-pence, called a\r\ncouncil of the village upon me, and they proceeded to determine whether\r\nI must have a guide from Gonten, or only from a nameless châlet higher\r\nup. The discussion was noisy, and was conducted without words: they do\r\nnot speak, those men of Gonten--they merely grunt, and each interprets\r\nthe grunts as he wills. My two-penny friend told me what it all meant,\r\nin an obliging manner, but in words less intelligible than the grunts;\r\nand one member of the council drew out so elaborate a route--the very\r\ncharacters being wild patois--splitting the morning into quarter-stundes\r\nand half-quarter-stundes, with a sharp turn to the right or left at the\r\nend of each, that, as I drank my coffee, I determined to take a guide\r\nfrom the village, whatever the decision of the council might be.\r\nFortunately, things took a right turn, and when breakfast was finished,\r\na deputation went out and found a guide, suspiciously like one of their\r\nnumber who did not return, and I was informed that Christian Opliger\r\nwould conduct me to the Schafloch for five francs, and a _Trinkgeld_ if\r\nI were satisfied with him. In order to prove to me that he had really\r\nbeen at the cave, six days before, with two Bernese gentlemen, he seized\r\nmy favourite low-crowned white hat, and endeavoured to knead it into the\r\nshape of the cave.\r\n\r\nOur affairs took a long time to arrange, for grunts and pantomime are\r\nnot rapid means of communication, when it comes to detail. The great\r\nquestion in Christian's mind seemed to be, what should we take with us\r\nto eat and drink? and when he propounded this to me with steady\r\npertinacity, I, with equal pertinacity, had only one answer--a cord and\r\na hatchet. At last he provided these, vowing that they were ridiculously\r\nunnecessary, but comprehending that they must be forthcoming, as a\r\npreliminary to anything more digestible; and then I told him, some dry\r\nbread and no wine. This drove him from grunts to words. No wine! it\r\nwould be so frightfully hot on the mountains!--I told him I never drank\r\nwine when I was hot. But it would be so terribly cold in the cave!--I\r\nnever drank wine when I was cold. But the climbing was _sehr stark_--we\r\nshould need to give ourselves strength!--I never needed to give myself\r\nstrength. There was no good water to be found the whole way!--I never\r\ndrank water. Then, at last, after a brief grunt with the landlord, he\r\nstruck:--he simply would not go without wine! I never wished him to do\r\nso, I explained; he might take as much as he chose, and I would pay for\r\nit, but he need not count me for anything in calculating how much was\r\nnecessary. This made him perfectly happy; and when I answered his\r\nquestion touching cheese in a similar manner, only limiting him to a\r\npound and a half, he rushed off for a large wicker _hotte_, spacious\r\nenough for the stowage of many layers of babies; and in it he packed all\r\nour properties, and all his provisions. The landlord had made his own\r\ncalculations, and put it at 3lbs. of bread and 2lbs. of cheese; but I\r\ncut down the bread on account of its bulk, before I saw the size of the\r\n_hotte_, and Christian seemed to think he had quite enough to carry.\r\n\r\nIt was about half-past nine when we started from the _auberge_; and\r\nafter a short mount in the full sun, we were not sorry to reach the\r\npleasant shade of walnut trees which accompanied us for a considerable\r\ndistance. The blue lake lay at our feet on the right, and beyond it the\r\nNiesen stood, with wonted grandeur, guarding its subject valleys; more\r\nin front, as we ascended transversely, the well-known snow-peaks of the\r\nBernese Oberland glittered high above the nearer foreground, and, sheer\r\nabove us, on the left, rose the ragged precipices whose flank we were to\r\nturn. The Rothhorn of the Canton Berne lies inland from the Lake of\r\nThun, and sends down towards the lake a ridge sufficiently lofty,\r\nterminating in the Ralligstöcke, or Ralligflue, the needle-like point,\r\nso prettily ridged with firs, which advances its precipitous sides to\r\nthe water. These precipices were formed in historic times, and the sheer\r\nface from which half a mountain has been torn stands now as clear and\r\nfresh as ever, while a chaos of vast blocks at its foot gives a point to\r\nthe local legends of devastation and ruin caused by the various\r\nberg-falls. Two such falls are clearly marked by the _débris_: one of\r\nthese, a hundred and fifty years ago, reduced the town of Ralligen to a\r\nsolitary Schloss; and the other, in 1856, overwhelmed the village of\r\nMerligen, and converted its rich pastures into a desert cropped with\r\nstones. A traveller in Switzerland, at the beginning of this century,\r\nfound that the inhabitants of Merligen were considered in the\r\nneighbourhood to be _d'une stupidité et d'une bêtise extrêmes_, and I\r\nam inclined to believe that after the last avalanche a general migration\r\nto Gonten must have taken place.\r\n\r\nChristian's patois was of so hopeless a description, that I was tempted\r\nto give it up in despair, and walk on in silence. Still, as we were\r\ntogether for a whole long day, for better or for worse, it seemed worth\r\nwhile to make every effort to understand each other, else I could learn\r\nno local tales and legends, and Christian would earn but little\r\n_Trinkgeld_; so we struggled manfully against our difficulties. A\r\nconfident American lady, meditating Europe, and knowing little French\r\nand no German, is said to have remarked jauntily that if the worst came\r\nto the worst she could always talk on her fingers to the peasants; but I\r\ndid not attempt to avail myself of the results of early practice in that\r\nuniversal language. Christian's answers--the more intelligible parts of\r\nthem--were a stratified succession of _yes_ and _no_, and as he was a\r\nman naturally polite and acquiescent, the assentient strata were of more\r\nfrequent occurrence; but of course, beyond showing his good-will, such\r\nanswers were of no practical value. At length, after long perseverance,\r\nwe were rewarded by the appearance of a curiosity which eventually gave\r\neach the key to the other's cipher. This was a strong stream of water,\r\nflowing out of the trunk of a growing tree, at a height of six feet or\r\nso from the ground; and I was so evidently interested in the phenomenon,\r\nthat Christian exerted himself to the utmost, at last with success, to\r\nexplain the construction of the fountain. A healthy poplar, seven or\r\neight years old, is taken from its native soil, and a cold iron borer is\r\nrun up the heart of the trunk from the roots, for six feet or more, by\r\nwhich means the pith is removed, and the trunk is made to assume the\r\ncharacter of a pipe. A hole is then bored through from the outside of\r\nthe trunk, to communicate with the highest point reached by the former\r\noperation, and in this second hole a spout is fixed. The same is done\r\nat a very short distance above the root, in the part of the trunk which\r\nwill be buried in the earth when the tree is replanted, and the poplar\r\nis then fixed in damp ground, with the pipe at its root in connection\r\nwith one of the little runs of water which abound in meadows at the foot\r\nof hills. A well-known property of fluids produces then the strange\r\neffect of an unceasing flow of water from an iron spout in the trunk of\r\na living tree; and, as poplars love water, the fountain-tree thrives,\r\nand is more vigorous than its neighbours. This sort of fountain may be\r\ncommon in some parts of Switzerland, but I have not seen them myself\r\nexcept in this immediate neighbourhood. There is said to be one near\r\nStachelberg.\r\n\r\nIn the endeavour to explain all this to me, Christian succeeded so\r\nperfectly, that for the rest of the day we understood each other very\r\nwell. When I told him that he spoke much better German than the rest of\r\nthe people in Gonten, he informed me that he had worked among\r\nforeigners, in proof whereof he held out his fingers; but all that I\r\ncould gather from the invited inspection was, that, whatever his\r\nemployment might have been, he could not be said to have come out of it\r\nwith clean hands. He had been employed, he explained, in German\r\ndye-works, and there had learned something better than the native\r\npatois. About this time, too, I was able to make him understand that, as\r\nhe carried more than I, he must call a halt whenever he felt so\r\ninclined; upon which he patted me affectionately on the back, and, if I\r\ncould remember the word he used, I believe that I should now know the\r\nSwiss-German for a brick.\r\n\r\nOur object was to pass along the side of the lake, at a considerable\r\nelevation, till we reached the east side of the Rothhorn range, when we\r\nwere to turn up the Jüstisthal, and mount towards the highest point of\r\nthe ridge, the glacière lying about an hour below the summit, in the\r\nface of the steep rock. The cliffs became very grand on either side, as\r\nsoon as we entered this valley, the Jüstisthal, especially the\r\nprecipices of the Beatenberg on the right; and our path lay through\r\nwoods which have sprung up on the site of an early _Berg-lauine._ The\r\nguide-books call attention to a cavern with a curious intermittent\r\nspring in this neighbourhood. English tourists should feel some interest\r\nin the Cave of S. Beatus, inasmuch as its canonised occupant went from\r\nour shores to preach the Gospel to the wild men of the district, and\r\ndied in this cave at a very advanced age. His relics remaining there,\r\nhis fête-day attracted such crowds of pilgrims, that reforming Berne\r\nsent two deputies in 1528 to carry off the saint's skull, and bury it\r\nbetween the lakes; but still the pilgrimages continued, and at length\r\nthe Protestant zeal of Berne went to the expense of a wall, and they\r\nbuilt the pilgrims out in 1566. S. Beatus is said to have been converted\r\nby S. Barnabas in Britain, and to have gone to Rome, whence S. Peter\r\nsent him out to preach. His relics were conveyed to Lucerne in 1554,\r\nbecause heresy prevailed in the country where his cave lies, and an arm\r\nis among the proud possessions of pilgrim-pressed Einsiedeln. The saint\r\nwas originally a British noble, by name Suetonius; and Dempster drops a\r\nletter from his name, and with much ingenuity makes him collateral\r\nancestor of a Scottish family--'The Setons, tall and proud.'[56]\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the last châlet, Christian turned to mount the grass\r\nslope on our left hand, which led to the part of the rocks in which the\r\nentrance to the Schafloch was to be sought. I never climbed up grass so\r\nsteep, and before we had gone very far we were hailed by a succession of\r\ngrunts, which my companion interpreted into assurances from some\r\ninvisible person that we were going wrong. The man soon appeared, in the\r\nshape of a charcoal-burner, and told us that we were making the ascent\r\nmuch more difficult than it need be made, and also, that we should come\r\nto some awkward rock-climbing by the route we had chosen. It was too\r\nlate, however, to turn back; so we persevered.\r\n\r\nBefore long, I heard a _Meinherr_! from Christian, in a tone which I\r\nknew meant rest and some food. He explained that he would rather take\r\ntwo small refreshments, one here and one at the Schafloch, than one\r\nlarge refreshment at the cave; so we propped ourselves on the grass, and\r\ntapped the _hotte_. The cheese proved to be delightful--six years old,\r\nthe landlady told us afterwards, and apparently as hard as a bone, but\r\nwhen once mastered its flavour was admirable. Christian persuaded me to\r\ntaste the wine, of which he had a high opinion, and he was electrified\r\nby the universal shudder the one taste caused. The grapes from which it\r\nwas brewed had been grown in a gooseberry garden, and all the saccharine\r\nmatter carefully extracted; the wine had been left without a cork since\r\nthe first dawn of its existence, and the heat and jolting of its travels\r\non Christian's back had reduced it to the condition of warm flat\r\nvinegar. He drank it with the utmost relish, and was evidently\r\nreconciled to my verdict by the consideration that there would be all\r\nthe more for him.\r\n\r\nFrom the appearance of the bread and cheese when the meal had come to an\r\nend, I concluded that my companion had changed his mind in the course of\r\nfeeding, and had resolved to compress the whole eating of the day into\r\none large refreshment here. The consumptive powers of the Swiss-German\r\npeasant, when his meal is franked, has not unfrequently reminded me of\r\nthe miraculous eating performed by a yellow domino of that nation, at\r\nthe fête by which Louis XIV. celebrated the second marriage of the\r\nDauphin. This domino was of large size, and ate and drank voraciously\r\nthroughout the entertainment, which lasted many hours, retiring every\r\nfive minutes or so, and returning speedily with unabated appetite. The\r\nthing became at length so portentous, that enquiries were instituted,\r\nand it was found that the trusty _Cent-Suisses_ had joined at a domino,\r\nand were drawing lots all through the evening for the next turn at\r\neating; so that each man's time was necessarily limited, and he\r\naccordingly made the most of it.\r\n\r\nWe soon took to the rocks, and found them, as the charcoal-burner had\r\npromised, sufficiently stiff work. Colonel (now General) Dufour visited\r\nthe Schafloch with a party of officers in 1822, and he describes[57] the\r\npath as a dangerous one, so much so that several of the gallant members\r\nof his party could not reach the cave: he uses rather large words about\r\nthe precipices, and it is a matter of observation that military service\r\non the Continent tends to induce a habit of body which is not the most\r\nsuitable for doubtful climbing. The mountain seemed to be composed, in\r\nthis part, of horizontal layers of crumbling shale, with a layer now and\r\nthen of stone, about the thickness of an ordinary house-tile. The stone\r\nlayers project from the looser masonry, and afford an excellent\r\nfoot-hold; but a slip might be unpleasant. Every one who has done even a\r\nsmall amount of climbing has met with an abundance of places where 'a\r\nslip would be certain death,' as people are so fond of saying; but\r\nequally he has discovered that a slip is the last thing he thinks of\r\nmaking in such situations. Christian had told me that if I had the\r\nslightest tendency to _Schwindelkopf_, I must not go by the improvised\r\nroute; but it proved that there were really no precipices at all, much\r\nless any of sufficient magnitude to turn an ordinary head dizzy. He\r\nchose these rocks as the text for a long sermon on the necessity for\r\ngreat caution when we should arrive at the cave, telling of an\r\nEnglishman who had tried to visit it two years before, and had cut his\r\nknee so badly with his guide's axe that he had to be carried down the\r\nmountain to Gonten, and thence to the steamer for Thun, in which town he\r\nlay for many weeks in the hands of the German doctor; this last\r\nassertion being by no means incredible. Also, of a native who attempted\r\nthe cave alone, and, making one false step near the top of a fall of\r\nice, slipped down and down almost for ever, and finally landed with\r\nbroken limbs on a floor of ice, where he was found, two days after,\r\nfrozen stiff, but still alive.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary to mount much, for we were almost as high as the\r\nmouth of the cave, according to Christian's belief, and our work\r\nconsisted chiefly in passing along the face of the rock, round\r\nprojecting buttresses and re-entering angles, till we reached that part\r\nof the mountain where we might expect to find our glacière. While we\r\nwere thus engaged, two hoarse and ominous ravens took us under their\r\ncharge, and accompanied us with unpleasant screams, which argued the\r\nproximity of food or nest. We soon found that we had disturbed their\r\nmeal, for we came to marks of blood, and saw that some animal had\r\nslipped on the rocks above, and landed on the ledge on which we were\r\nwalking, bounding off again on to a shelf below, where the ravens had\r\nalready torn the body to pieces. I must confess to a very considerable\r\nshudder when we discovered the reason of their screams, and neither of\r\nus seemed to enjoy the circling and croaking of the unclean birds.\r\n\r\nVery soon after this, Christian announced that we had reached the cave,\r\nand a steep little climb of six feet or so brought us to the entrance.\r\nHere we were haunted still by the presence of pieces of the fallen goat,\r\nwhich lay about here and there on the ground; and the flutter of wings\r\noverhead explained to us that the old ravens had built their nest in the\r\nmouth of the cave, and had brought morsels of raw flesh to their young\r\nones, which were scarcely able to fly. I am ashamed to say that we were\r\nso angry with the old birds for shrieking so suggestively in our ears,\r\nand parading before us the results of a slip on the rocks, that we\r\ncharged ourselves with stones, and put an end to the most noisy member\r\nof the foul brood; Christian making some of the worst shots it is\r\npossible to conceive, and raining blocks of stone and lumps of wood in\r\nall directions, with such reckless impartiality, that the only safe\r\nplace seemed to be between him and the bird. One of us, at least,\r\nregretted the useless cruelty as soon as it was perpetrated, and it came\r\nback upon me very reproachfully at an awkward part of our return\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThe Schafloch does not take its name from the bones contained in it, as\r\nis the case with the Kühloch in Franconia,[58] but from the fact that\r\nwhen a sudden storm comes on, the sheep and goats make their way to the\r\ncave for shelter, never, I was told, going so far as the commencement of\r\nthe ice. The entrance faces ESE., and is of large size, with a low wall\r\nbuilt partly across it to increase the shelter for the sheep: Dufour\r\ncalls the entrance 50 feet wide and 25 feet high, but I found the width\r\nat the narrowest part, a few yards within the entrance, to be 33\r\nfeet.[59] For a short distance the cave passes horizontally into the\r\nrock, in a westerly direction, and is quite light; it then turns sharp\r\nto the south, the floor beginning to fall, and candles becoming\r\nnecessary. Here the height increases considerably, and the way lies over\r\na wild confusion of loose masses of rock, which have apparently fallen\r\nfrom the roof, and make progression very difficult. We soon reached a\r\npoint where ice began to appear among the stones; and as we advanced it\r\nbecame more and more prominent, till at length we lost sight of the\r\nrock, and stood on solid ice.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the cave was a grand column of ice forming the\r\nportal, as it were, through which we must pass to further beauties.\r\nThe ice-floor rose to meet these columns in a graceful swelling curve,\r\nperfectly continuous, so that the general effect was that of two\r\ncolumns whose roots expanded and met in the middle of the cave; and,\r\nindeed, that may have been really the order of formation. The\r\nright-hand column was larger than its fellow, but, owing to the more\r\ngradual expansion of the lower part of its height, and the steepness\r\nof the consequent slope, we were unable to measure its girth at any\r\npoint where it could be fairly called a column. Christian had been in\r\nthe cave a few days before, and he assured me that the swelling base\r\nof this column had increased very considerably since his last visit,\r\npointing out a solid surface of ice, at one part of our track, where\r\nhe had before walked on bare rock. The cave was by no means extremely\r\ncold, that is to say, it was rather above than below the freezing\r\npoint, and the splashing of drops of water was audible on all sides;\r\nso that, if Christian spoke the truth,--it was sad to be so often\r\nreminded of Legree's plaintive soliloquy in the opening pages of\r\n'Uncle Tom's Cabin,'--the explanation, I suppose, might be that the\r\ndrops of water, falling on the top of the column or stalagmite, run\r\ndown the sides, and carry with them some melted portion from the upper\r\npart of the column, and after a course of a few yards become so far\r\nrefrigerated as to form ice.[60] The pillar on the left was more\r\napproachable, but we were unable to determine its dimensions; for on\r\nthe outer side, where it stood a few feet or yards clear of the side\r\nof the cave, the rounded ice at its foot fell off at once into a dark\r\nchasm, a sort of smooth enticing _Bergschrund_, which we did not care\r\nto face. Christian declared that this column was not so high as it was\r\na day or two before, which may go to support the theory expressed\r\nabove, or at least that part of it which depends upon the supposition\r\nof water dropping on to the head of the column, and melting certain\r\nportions of it.\r\n\r\nIf we were unable to take the external dimensions of this column, I\r\nhad no doubt that we should find internal investigations interesting;\r\nso, to Christian's surprise, I began to chop a hole in it, about two\r\nfeet from the ground, and, having made an entrance sufficiently large,\r\nproceeded to get into the cavity which presented itself. The flooring\r\nof the dome-shaped grotto in which I found myself, was loose rock, at\r\na level about two feet below the surface of the ice-floor on which\r\nChristian still stood. The dome itself was not high enough to allow me\r\nto stand upright, and from the roof, principally from the central\r\npart, a complex mass of delicate icicles passed down to the floor,\r\nleaving a narrow burrowing passage round, which was itself invaded by\r\nicicles from the lower part of the sloping roof, and by stubborn\r\nstalagmites of ice rising from the floor.[61] The details of this\r\ncentral cluster of icicles, and in fact of every portion of the\r\ninterior of the strange grotto, were exceedingly lovely, and I crushed\r\nwith much regret, on hands and knees, through fair crystal forests and\r\nfrozen dreams of beauty. In making the tour of this grotto, contorting\r\nmy body like a snake to get in and out among the ice-pillars, and do\r\nas little damage as might be, but yet, with all my care, accompanied\r\nby the incessant shiver and clatter of breaking and falling ice, I\r\ncame to a hole in the ground, too dark and deep for one candle to show\r\nits depth; so I called to Christian to come in, thinking that two\r\ncandles might show it better. He asked if I really meant it, and\r\nassured me he could be of no use; but I told him that he must come,\r\nand informed him that he, being the smaller man, would find the\r\npassage quite easy. It was very fortunate that I had not waited a\r\nminute longer before summoning him, for just as he had dropped into\r\nthe hollow, and was beginning his journey to the side where I now was,\r\na drop of water and a simultaneous icicle came upon my candle, and\r\nleft me in darkness, curled up like a dormouse in a nest of ice, at\r\nthe edge of the newly discovered shaft; while my troubles were brought\r\nto a climax by an incursion of icy drops, which had me at their mercy.\r\nIf all this had happened while Christian was still outside, he would\r\nprobably have staid there wringing his hands till it was time to go\r\nhome, and I should certainly not have liked to move without a light.\r\nAs it was, I did not inform him of the catastrophe, but let him come\r\ntoiling on, wondering audibly what madness could drive Herrschaft into\r\nsuch places; and when he arrived, we cut off the wet wick, and lighted\r\nthe candle again. We could make nothing of the hole, so he returned by\r\nthe way he had come, and I completed the tour of the grotto, finding\r\nthe same difficult passage, and the same ice beauties, all the way\r\nround.\r\n\r\nHaving squeezed ourselves out again through the narrow hole, we now\r\npassed between the two gigantic columns, and found that the sea of ice\r\nbecame still broader and bolder. I much regret that I neglected to take\r\nany measurements in this part of the cave; but farther down, where it\r\nwas certainly not so broad, I found the width of the ice to be 75 feet.\r\nIt was throughout of the crystalline character which prevails in all the\r\nlarge masses in the glacières I have visited. For some distance beyond\r\nthe columns, we found neither stalactites nor stalagmites--indeed, I\r\nforgot to look at the roof--until we came to the edge of a glorious\r\nice-fall, down which Christian said it was impossible to go--no one had\r\never been farther than where we now stood. I have seen no subterranean\r\nice-fall so grand as this, round and smooth, and perfectly unbroken,\r\npassing down, like the rapids of some river too deep for its surface to\r\nbe disturbed, into darkness against which two candles prevailed nothing.\r\nThe fall in the Upper Glacière of the Pré de S. Livres was strange\r\nenough, but it was very small, and led to a confined corner of the\r\ncavern; whereas this of the Schafloch rolls down majestically, cold and\r\ngrey, into a dark gulf of which we could see neither the roof nor the\r\nend, while the pieces of ice which we despatched down the steep slope\r\ncould be heard going on and on, as M. Soret says, _à une très-grande\r\ndistance_. The shape, also, of the fall was very striking. Beginning at\r\nthe left wall of the cave, the edge ran out obliquely towards the\r\nmiddle, when it suddenly turned and struck straight across to the\r\nright-hand wall, so that we were able to stand on a tongue, as it were,\r\nin the middle of the top of the fall. To add to the effect, precisely\r\nfrom this tongue or angle a fine column of ice sprang out of the very\r\ncrest of the fall, rising to or towards the roof, and to this we clung\r\nto peer down into the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe rope we had brought was not long, and the idea was hopeless of\r\ncutting steps down this great fall, leading we knew not where, with an\r\nincline which it frightened Christian even to look at. I began to\r\nconsider, however, whether it was not possible to make our way down the\r\nleft branch of the ice, which fell rather towards the side wall than\r\ninto the dark gulf below. On examining more closely, I found that a\r\nlarge stone, or piece of rock, projected from the face of this branch of\r\nthe fall, about 12 feet from the top, and to this I determined to\r\ndescend, as a preliminary to further attempts, the candles not showing\r\nus what there was beyond. Accordingly, I tied on the rope, and planted\r\nChristian where he had a safe footing, telling him to hold tight if I\r\nslipped, for he seemed to have little idea what the rope was meant for.\r\nThe ice was very hard, and cutting steps downwards with a short axe is\r\nnot easy work; so when I came within 3 or 4 feet of the rock, I forgot\r\nthe rope, and set off for a short glissade. Christian, of course,\r\nthought something was wrong, and very properly put a prompt strain upon\r\nthe rope, which reduced his Herr to a spread-eagle sort of condition, in\r\nwhich it was difficult to explain matters, so as to procure a release.\r\nWhen that was accomplished, I saw it would be easy to reach the point\r\nwhere the ice met the wall, so I called to Christian to come down, which\r\nhe did in an unpremeditated, avalanche fashion; and then, by cutting\r\nsteps here and there, and making use of odd points of rock, we skirted\r\ndown the edge of the great fall, and reached at last the lower regions.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to read Dufour's account of his visit in 1822, I found that\r\nthe ice must have increased very much since his time. He uses\r\nsufficiently large words, speaking of the _vaste, horrible et pourtant\r\nmagnifique_--of the _horreur du séjour_, and the _grandeur des demeures\r\nsouterraines_; but he only calls the glorious ice-fall a _plan incliné_,\r\nand says that the whole was less remarkable for the amount of ice, than\r\nfor the characteristics indicated by the words I have quoted. He says\r\nthat it required _une assez forte dose de courage_ to slip down to the\r\nstone of which I have spoken; the fact being that at the time of my\r\nvisit it would have been impossible to do so with any chance of stopping\r\noneself, for the flat surface of the stone was all but even with the\r\nice. M. Soret, who saw the cave in 1860, determined that cords were then\r\nabsolutely necessary for the descent, which he did not attempt; and the\r\nonly Englishman I have met who has seen this cave, tells me that he and\r\nhis party went no farther than the edge of the fall.[62] Probably each\r\nyear's accumulation on the upper floor of ice has added to the height\r\nand rapidity of the fall; but at any rate, when Dufour was there, _des\r\nmilitaires_--as he dashingly tells--were not to be stopped, and he and\r\nhis party--such of them as had not been already stopped by the\r\nprecipices outside--let themselves slip down to the stone, and thence\r\ndescended as we did.\r\n\r\nWe soon found that the larger ice-fall looked extremely grand when seen\r\nfrom below, and that in a modified form it reached far down into the\r\nlower cave, and terminated in a level sea of ice; but, before making any\r\nfurther investigations into its size, we pressed on to look for the end\r\nof the cave. This soon appeared, and as a commentary on Christian's\r\nassertion that no one had ever been beyond the head of the fall, I\r\ncalled his attention to some initials smoked on the wall by means of a\r\ntorch. There was an abrupt piece of rock-floor between this end and the\r\ntermination of the ice. The western wall was ornamented with a long\r\narcade of lofty columns of very white ice, looking strangely ghostlike\r\nby the light of two candles, crystallised, and with the porcelain\r\nappearance I have described before. We could not measure the height of\r\nthese columns, but we found that they extended continuously, so as to be\r\nin fact one sheet of columns, connected by shapes of ice now graceful\r\nand now grotesque, for 27 yards. The ice from their feet flowed down to\r\njoin the terminal lake, which formed a weird sea 28 yards by 14. My\r\nnotes, written on the spot, tell me that between this lake, which I have\r\ncalled terminal, and the end of the cave, there is a sheet of ice 48\r\nyards long, but it has entirely vanished from my recollection.\r\n\r\nI now sent Christian back with a ball of string, up the steps we had cut\r\nfor the descent, with directions to get as near as he could to the top\r\nof the main fall, and then send down a stone tied to the string, as I\r\nwished to determine the length of the fall. While he was making his way\r\nup, I amused myself by chopping and carving at the ice at various\r\npoints to examine its structure, until at length a _Jodel_ from above\r\nannounced that Christian had reached his post; and a vast amount of\r\nhammering ensued, of which I could not understand the meaning. Presently\r\nhe called out that 'it' was coming, and assuredly it did come. There was\r\na loud crash on the upper part of the fall, and a shower of fragments of\r\nice came whizzing past, and almost dislodged me; while the sound of\r\npieces of ice bounding and gliding down the slope seemed as if it never\r\nwould cease. It turned out to mean that my friend had not been able to\r\nfind a stone; so he had smashed a block of ice from the column which\r\npresided over the fall, and having attached the string to this, had\r\nhurled the whole apparatus in my direction, fortunately not doing as\r\nmuch damage as he might have done. My end of the string was not to be\r\nseen, so he repeated the experiment, with a piece of wood in place of\r\nthe block of ice, and this time it succeeded. We found that from top to\r\nbottom of the fall was 45 yards. There was all the appearance of immense\r\nthickness, especially towards the upper part.\r\n\r\nChristian had placed his candle in a niche in the column, while he\r\narranged the string for measuring the fall, and the effect of the spark\r\nof light at the top of the long steep slope was extremely strange from\r\nbelow. The whole scene was so remarkable, that it required some effort\r\nto realise the fact that I was not in a dream. Christian stood at the\r\ntop invisible, jodeling in a most unearthly manner, and developing an\r\nastonishing falsetto power, only interrupting his performance to assure\r\nme that he was not coming down again; so I was obliged to measure the\r\nbreadth of the fall by myself. I chose a part where the ice was not very\r\nsteep, and where occasional points of rock would save some of the labour\r\nof cutting steps; but even so it was a sufficiently tedious business.\r\nThe string was always catching at something, and mere progression,\r\nwithout any string to manage, would have been difficult enough under the\r\ncircumstances. It was completely dark, so a candle occupied one hand,\r\nand, as every step must be cut, save where an opportune rock or stone\r\nappeared, an axe occupied the other; then there was the string to be\r\nattended to, and both hands must be ready to clutch at some projecting\r\npoint when a slip came, and now and then a ruder rock required\r\ncircumvention. Add to all this, that hands and feet had not been\r\nrendered more serviceable by an hour and a half of contact with ice, and\r\nit will easily be understood that I was glad when the measurement was\r\nover. At this point the breadth was 25 yards, and, a few feet above the\r\nline in which I crossed, all traces of rock or stone disappeared, and\r\nthere was nothing but unbroken ice. I had of course abundant\r\nopportunities for examining the structure of the ice, and I found in all\r\nparts of the fall the same large-grained material, breaking up, when\r\ncut, into the usual prismatic nuts.\r\n\r\nI now rejoined Christian, and we worked our way upwards to the mouth of\r\nthe cave, penitently desisting from stoning a remaining raven. We\r\nobserved at the very mouth, by watching the flame of the candles, a\r\nslight current outwards, extremely feeble, and on our first arrival I\r\nhad fancied there was a current, equally slight, inwards, but neither\r\nwas perceptible beyond the entrance of the cave. M. Soret was fortunate\r\nenough to witness a curious phenomenon, at the time of his visit to the\r\nSchafloch, in September 1860, which throws some light upon the\r\natmospheric state of the cave. The day was externally very foggy, and\r\nthe fog had penetrated into the cavern; but as soon as M. Soret began to\r\ndescend to the glacière itself, properly so called, he passed down out\r\nof the fog, and found the air for the rest of the way perfectly\r\nclear.[63]\r\n\r\nM. Soret states that he has not absolute confidence in his\r\nthermometrical observations, but as he had more time than I to devote to\r\nsuch details, inasmuch as he did not pass down into the lowest part of\r\nthe cave, I give his results rather than my own, which were carelessly\r\nmade on this occasion:--On a stone near the first column of ice,\r\n0°·37 C.; on a stick propped against the column on the edge of the great\r\nice-fall, 2°·37 C.; in a hole in the ice, filled with water by drops\r\nfrom the roof, 0° C. approximately.[64] The second result is\r\nsufficiently remarkable. My own observations would give nearer 33° F.\r\nthan 32° as the general temperature of the cave.\r\n\r\nChristian was so cold when we had finished our investigations, that he\r\ndetermined to take his second refreshment _en route_, and, moreover,\r\ntime was getting rather short. We had started from Gonten at half-past\r\nnine in the morning, and reached the glacière about half-past twelve.\r\nIt was now three o'clock, and the boat from Gonten must reach the\r\nsteamer at half-past six precisely, so there was not too much time for\r\nus; especially as we were to return by a more mountainous route, which\r\ninvolved further climbing towards the summit of the Rothhorn, and was\r\nto include a visit to the top of the Ralligflue. On emerging from the\r\ncave, we were much struck by the beauty of the view, the upper half of\r\nthe Jungfrau, with its glittering attendants and rivals, soaring above\r\na rich and varied foreground not unworthy of so glorious a\r\ntermination. There was not time, however, to admire it as it deserved,\r\nand we set off almost at once up the rocks, soon reaching a more\r\nelevated table-land by dint of steep climbing. The ground of this\r\ntable-land was solid rock, smoothed and rounded by long weathering,\r\nand fissured in every direction by broad and narrow crevasses 2 or 3\r\nfeet deep, at the bottom of which was luxuriant botany, in the shape\r\nof ferns, and mallows, and monkshood, and all manner of herbs. The\r\nlearned in such matters call these rock-fallows _Karrenfelden_. When\r\nwe had crossed this plateau, and came to grass, we found a gorgeous\r\ncarpet of the huge couched blue gentian (_G. acaulis_, Fr. _Gentiane\r\nsans tige_), with smaller patterns put in by the dazzling blue of the\r\ndelicate little flower of the same species (_G. verna_ ); while the\r\nwhite blossoms of the grass of Parnassus, and the frailer white of the\r\n_dryade à huit petales_, and the modest waxen flowers of the _Azalea\r\nprocumbens_ and the _airelle ponctuée_ (_Vaccineum vitis idaea_),\r\ntempered and set off the prevailing blue. There were groves, too,\r\nrather lower down, of Alpine roses (the first I had come across that\r\nyear), not the fringed or the green-backed species which botanists\r\nlove best, but the honest old rust-backed rhododendron, which every\r\nSwiss traveller has been pestered with in places where the children\r\nare one short step above mere mendicity, but, equally, which every\r\nSwiss traveller hails with Medean delight when he comes upon it on the\r\nmountain-side. We were now, too, in the neighbourhood of the first\r\ncreated Alpen rose. The story is, that a young peasant, who had\r\nclimbed the precipices behind Oberhausen for rock-flowrets, as the\r\nprice of some maiden's love, fell at the moment when he had secured\r\nthe flowers, and was killed. From his blood the true Alpen rose\r\nsprang, and took its colour.\r\n\r\nWe were now passing along the summit of one of the lower spurs of the\r\nRothhorn range, and making for the peak of the Ralligflue, which lay\r\nconsiderably below us. In descending near the line of crest, we found a\r\nlarge number of very deep fissures, narrow and black, some of them\r\nextending to a great distance across the face of the hill; sometimes\r\nthey appeared as mere holes, down which we despatched stones, sometimes\r\nas unpleasant crevasses almost hidden by flowers and the shrubs of\r\nrhododendron. In many of these we dimly discovered accumulated snow at\r\nthe bottom, and we observed that the Alpine roses which overhung the\r\nsnow-holes were by far the deepest coloured and most beautiful we could\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nTo reach the Ralligflue, we had to cross a smooth green lawn completely\r\ncovered with the sweet vanilla orchis (_O. nigra_), which perfumed the\r\nair almost too powerfully. No one can ever fully appreciate the grandeur\r\nof the lion-like Niesen till he has seen it from this verdant little\r\nparadise, on the slope near the Bergli Châlet, with a diminutive limpid\r\nlake in the meadow at his feet, and the blue lake of Thun below. The\r\nKanderthal and the Simmenthal lie exposed from their entrance at the\r\nfoot of the Niesen; and when the winding Kanderthal is lost, the\r\nAdelbodenthal takes up the telescope, and guides the eye to the parent\r\nglaciers. This view I was fortunately able to enjoy rather longer than\r\nthat from the mouth of the Schafloch; for we had made such rapid way,\r\nthat Christian found there was time for a meal of milk in the châlet,\r\nand meanwhile left me lying in perfect luxury on the sweet grass.\r\n\r\nFrom the Ralligflue a long and remarkably steep zigzag leads to the\r\nlower ground, and down this Christian ran at full speed, jodeling in a\r\nmost trying manner; indeed, at one of the sudden turns of the path he\r\nwent off triumphantly into a falsetto so unearthly, that he lost his\r\nlegs, and landed in a promiscuous sort of way on a lower part of the\r\nzigzag, after which he was slower and less vocal.\r\n\r\nWe eventually reached Gonten so soon, that there was time to cool and\r\nhave a bath in the lake; and when that was nearly finished, Christian\r\nbrought a plate of cherries and a detachment of the village, and I\r\nate the cherries and held a levée in the boat--very literally a levée,\r\nas the dressing was by no means accomplished when the deputation\r\narrived. My late guide, now, as he said, a friend for life, made a\r\nspeech to the people, setting forth that he had done that day what he\r\nhad never thought to do; for, often as he had been to the entrance of\r\nthe Schafloch--five or six times at the least--he had never before\r\nreached the end of the cave. And to whom, he asked, did he owe it? All\r\nprevious Herrschaft under his charge had cried _Immer zurück!_ but\r\nthis present Herr had known but one cry, _Immer vorwärts!_ Luckily the\r\nsteamer now approached, so the speech came to an end, and he shook\r\nhands affectionately, with a vigour that would certainly have\r\ntransmitted some of the dye, if that material had not become a part of\r\nthe skin which it coloured. Then the village also shook hands, having\r\nevidently understood what Christian said, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat it was intelligible German, and I returned to Thun and Berne.\r\n\r\nNo. 53 was still the only bed disengaged, for it was very late when I\r\nreached Berne; but on my vehement protestations against that unquiet\r\nchamber, the landlord most obligingly converted a sofa in his own\r\nsitting-room into a temporary bed, and made it over to me. This room was\r\nseparated by a door of ground-glass from another sitting-room\r\nbrilliantly lighted, in which a number of German young gentlemen were\r\nfêting the return of a comrade after the national manner. The landlord\r\nsaid he thought it must soon be over, for he doubted whether they could\r\nlast much longer; but their powers of endurance were greater than he had\r\nsupposed. It will readily be imagined that German songs with a good\r\nchorus, the solo parts being very short, and received with the utmost\r\nimpatience by the chorus, were even less soporific in their effect than\r\nthe flirtations--though boisterous beyond all conventional propriety--of\r\nGerman housemaids and waiters.[65]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: See p. 258.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Acta SS.

One of the party 'having taken some large stones with him, he\r\nbegan hurling them into the profound mystery. Presently a heavy\r\ndouble-bass gurgle issued forth with ominous depth of voice, indicating\r\nthe danger of farther progress. Having thus ascertained that if either\r\nof us ventured farther he would most probably not return by the way he\r\nwent, the signal of retreat was given, and in about forty minutes, after\r\nencountering the same amusing difficulties which had enlivened our\r\ndescent, Æneas-like we gained the upper air.' It will be seen from my\r\naccount of what we found in the 'abyss of unfathomable water,' that a\r\nlittle farther exploration might have effected a change in the writer's\r\nviews.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE OF GRAND ANU, ON THE MONTAGNE DE L'EAU, NEAR ANNECY.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Thury's list contained a bare mention of two glacières on the M.\r\nParmelan, near Annecy, without any further information respecting them,\r\nbeyond the fact that they supplied ice for Lyons. Their existence had\r\nbeen apparently reported to him by M. Alphonse Favre, but he had\r\nobtained no account of a visit to the caves. Under these circumstances,\r\nthe only plan was to go to Annecy, and trust to chance for finding some\r\none there who could assist me in my search.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a day or two in the library at Geneva, looking up M.\r\nThury's references, with respect to various ice-caves, and trying to\r\ndiscover something more than he had found in the books there, I started\r\nfor Annecy at seven in the morning in the banquette of the diligence. On\r\na fresher day, no doubt the great richness of the orchards and\r\ncorn-fields would have been very striking; but on this particular\r\nmorning the fields were already trembling with heat, and the trees and\r\nthe fruit covered with dust; and there was nothing in the grouping of\r\nthe country through which the road lay to refresh the baked and\r\nhalf-choked traveller. The voyage was to last four and a half hours, and\r\nit soon became a serious question how far it would be possible to face\r\nthe heat of noon, when the earlier morning was so utterly unbearable.\r\n\r\nBefore very long, a counter-irritant appeared in the shape of a\r\nfellow-traveller, whose luggage consisted of a stick and an old pair of\r\nboots. The man was not pleasant to be near in any way, and he was\r\nevidently not at all satisfied with the amount of room I allowed him. He\r\nkept discontentedly and doggedly pushing his spare pair of boots farther\r\nand farther into my two-thirds of the seat, and once or twice was on the\r\npoint of a protest, in which case I was prepared to tell him that as he\r\nfilled the whole banquette with his smell, he ought in reason to be\r\nsatisfied with less room for himself; but instead of speaking, he\r\nbrought out a tobacconist's parcel and began to open it. Tobacco-smoke\r\nis all very well under suitable circumstances, but it is possible to be\r\ntoo hot and dusty and bilious to be able to stand it, and I watched his\r\nproceedings with more of annoyance than of resignation. The parcel\r\nturned out, however, to be delightful snuff, tastefully perfumed and\r\nvery refreshing; and the politeness with which the owner gave a pinch to\r\nthe foreign monsieur, after apportioning a handful to the driver and\r\nconductor, won him a good three inches more of seat. The inevitable\r\ncigar soon came; but it was a very good one, and no one could complain:\r\nall the same, I could not help feeling a malicious satisfaction when the\r\n_douaniers_ on the French frontier investigated the spare\r\nboots--guiltless, one might have thought, of anything except the\r\nextremity of age and dirt--and drew from them a bundle or two of\r\nsmuggled cigars, the owner trying in vain to look as if he rather liked\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Hôtel de Genève is probably the least objectionable of the hotels\r\nof Annecy; but the Poste-bureau is at the Hôtel d'Angleterre, and it\r\nwas much too hot for me to fight with the waiters there, and carry off\r\nmy knapsack to another house. It is generally a mistake--a great\r\nmistake--to sleep at a house which is the starting-place and the goal\r\nof many diligences. All the night through, whips are cracking, bells\r\njingling, and men are shouting hoarsely or blowing hoarser horns.\r\nMoreover, the Hôtel d'Angleterre had apparently needed a fresh coat of\r\npaint and universal papering for many years, and the latter need had\r\nat this crisis been so far grappled with that the old paper had been\r\ntorn down from the walls and now lay on the various floors, while\r\nlarge pies of malodorous sizing had been planted at the angles of the\r\nstairs. The natural _salle-à-manger_ was evidently an excellent room,\r\nwith oleander balconies, but it was at present in the hands of\r\njoiners, and a card pointed the way to the 'provisionary\r\n_salle-à-manger'_--not a bad name for it--in the neighbourhood of the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nThere was one redeeming feature. The people of the house were\r\nnice-looking and well-dressed. But experience has taught me to view such\r\na phenomenon in French towns of humbler rank with somewhat mixed\r\nfeelings. When the house is superintended with a keen and watchful eye\r\nby a young lady of fashionable appearance, who takes a personal interest\r\nin a solitary traveller, and suggests an evening's _course_ on the lake,\r\nor a morning's drive to some good view, and makes herself most winning\r\nand agreeable; who takes the words, moreover, out of the mouth of a man\r\nmeditating an ordinary dinner, and assures him that she knows exactly\r\nwhat he wants, and he shall be well satisfied, with a sisterly air that\r\nmakes the idea of francs and sous not sordid only, but impossible; I\r\nhave slowly learned to expect that this fashion and condescension will\r\nappear in the bill. Prettiness is a very expensive item in such a case;\r\nand as these three were all combined to a somewhat remarkable degree at\r\nthe Hôtel d'Angleterre, the eventual bill made me angry, and I should\r\ncertainly try the Hôtel de Genève on any future visit to Annecy.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done was to determine the position of the Mont\r\nParmelan. I was prepared to find the people of the town denying the\r\nexistence of such a mountain; but, as it was visible from the door of\r\nthe hotel, they could not go quite so far as that. The small crowd at\r\nthe door repudiated the glacières with one voice, and pointed out how\r\nunlikely it was that Lyons should be supplied with ice from Annecy;\r\nnevertheless, I continued to ask my way in spite of protestation, till\r\nat length a lame man passed by, who said monsieur was quite right--he\r\nhimself knew two glacières on the Mont Parmelan very well. He had never\r\nseen either of them, but he knew them as well as if he had. It was\r\nuseless to go to them now, he added, for the owners extracted all the\r\nice early in the year, and stored it in holes in the lower part of the\r\nmountain. He had no idea by what route they were to be approached from\r\nAnnecy, or on which side of the Mont Parmelan they lay.\r\n\r\nI now looked on the local map, and determined that the best plan would\r\nbe to take the Bonneville diligence as far as Charvonnaz, the point on\r\nthe road which seemed to lie nearest to the roots of the Mont Parmelan,\r\nand then be guided by what I might learn among the peasants. Everyone\r\nsaid there was no chance of getting to anything by that means; but as\r\nthe hotel people saw that it was of no use to deny the glacières any\r\nlonger, they proposed to take me to a man who knew the M. Parmelan well,\r\nand could tell me all about it. This man proved to be a keeper of\r\nvoitures,--an ominous profession under the circumstances,--and he\r\nassured me that I could make a most lovely _course_ the next day,\r\nthrough scenery of unrivalled beauty; and he eloquently told on his\r\nfingers the villages and sights I should come to. I suggested--without\r\nin the least knowing that it was so--that the drive might be all very\r\nwell in itself, but it would not bring me to the glacières; on which he\r\nassured me that he knew every inch of the mountain, and there was not\r\nsuch a thing as a glacière in the whole district. At this moment, a\r\ngentlemanlike man was brought up by the waiter, and introduced to me as\r\na monsieur who knew a monsieur who knew the proprietor of one of the\r\nglacières, and would he happy to conduct me to this second monsieur: so,\r\nwithout any very ceremonious farewell to the owner of the proffered\r\nvoiture, we marched off together down the street, and eventually turned\r\ninto a _café_, whose master was the monsieur for whom we were in search.\r\nKnow the glacière?--yes, indeed! he had ice from it one year every\r\nmorning. His wife and he had made a _course_ to the campagne of M. the\r\nMaire of Aviernoz, and he--the cafétier--had descended for miles, as it\r\nwere, down and down, till he came to an underground world of ice,\r\nwonderful, totally wonderful: there he perceived so immense a cold, that\r\nhe drank a bottle of rhoom--a whole bottle--and drank it from the neck,\r\n_à l'Anglaise_. And when they had gone so far that great dread came upon\r\nthem, they rolled a stone down the ice, and it went into the\r\ndarkness--boom, boom, boom,--and he put on a power of ventriloquism\r\nwhich admirably represented the strange suggestive sound. Hold a moment!\r\nhad monsieur a crayon? Yes, monsieur had; so the things were impetuously\r\nswept off a round marble table, and the excited little man drew a fancy\r\nportrait of the glacière. The way to reach it? Go by diligence to\r\nCharvonnaz--exactly what I had determined upon--and walk up to Aviernoz,\r\nwhere his good friend the maire would make me see his beautiful\r\nglacière, through the means of a letter which he went to write. It was\r\nabsurd to see this hot little man sign himself 'Dugravel, _glacier_,'\r\nthat being the style of his profession, naturally recalling the\r\ncontradictory conduct of the Latin noun _lucus_.\r\n\r\nThe bones of S. Francis of Sales lie in the church of S. François in\r\nAnnecy, and I made a pilgrimage in search of them through very\r\nunpleasant streets. After a time, the Italian west front of the church\r\nappeared; but the main door led into a demonstrative bakery, and the\r\ndoor of the north aisle was obscured by oleanders and a striped awning,\r\nand over it appeared the legend, '_Entrée de l'Hôtel_.' As a man\r\npolitely explained, they had built S. Francis another church, and\r\nutilised the old one. The town itself seemed to be of the squalid style\r\nof antiquity--old, no doubt, but very dirty. It is pervaded by streams,\r\nwhich crop up among the houses, and flow through dark alleys and vaulted\r\npassages, rarely coming into daylight, and suggesting all manner of dark\r\ncrimes. The red-legged French kettledrums are, if possible, more\r\ninsolent here than in other places, and it is evident that the dogs are\r\nnot yet reconciled to the annexation, for the guard swept through the\r\nstreets amid a perfect tornado of howls from the negligent scavengers of\r\nthe place. For my own part, I was not pleased with the change of rule,\r\nwhen I found that since Annecy has become French, the _vin d'Asti_ has\r\nbecome dear, as being now a foreign wine.\r\n\r\nThe diligence for Bonneville was to leave Annecy at half-past four in\r\nthe morning; so I told them to call me at four, intending to breakfast\r\nsomewhere on the way. But of course, when four o'clock came, I had to\r\ncall myself, and in a quarter of an hour a knock at the door announced\r\nhalf-past four. I pounced upon the man, and remonstrated with him, but\r\nhe assured me it did not matter; and when I reminded him that the\r\ndiligence was to leave at half-past four, he observed philosophically\r\nthat it was quite true, and I had better make haste, for the poste was\r\nvery punctual. At the door of the bureau a loaded diligence stood,\r\nmarked _Annecy--Aix_, and I asked had the Bonneville diligence gone? It\r\ndid not go till six, the clerk told me; but I reminded him he had said\r\nhalf-past four when I asked him last night. Half-past four?--true, here\r\nwas the carriage standing at the door. But that was for Aix, not\r\nBonneville, I pointed out to him. Pardon--it was marked Aix, but was in\r\nfact meant for Bonneville.\r\n\r\nThe diligence reached the end of the by-road leading to Villaz in about\r\nhalf an hour, and all the fever of Geneva and Annecy seemed to fly away\r\nbefore the freshness of this green little lane, with clematis in full\r\nflower pervading the hedges, and huge clusters of young nuts peeping\r\nout, and promising later delights to fortunate passers-by. But, alas!\r\nthe little lane soon came to an end, and as I faced the fields of corn\r\nup the mountain-side, the hot thunderous air came rolling down in\r\npalpable billows, and oppressive clouds took possession of the\r\nsurrounding hills. Three-quarters of an hour brought me to Villaz, a\r\nclose collection of houses on the hill-side, with arched stone gateways\r\nleading into the farmyards,--a fortified style of agricultural building\r\nwhich seems to prevail in that district. After an amount of experience\r\nin out-of-the-way places which makes me very cautious in saying that one\r\nin particular is dirtier than a dozen others, I venture to say that the\r\n_auberge_ of Villaz is the most squalid I have come across; and I would\r\nnot feed there again, except in very robust health, even for a new\r\nglacière. Still, it was absolutely necessary to eat something, and the\r\nlandlady promised coffee and bread. She showed me first into the\r\nkitchen; but as it was also the place where the domestics slept, with\r\nmany quadrupeds, I declined to sit there. Upon this she led me to the\r\n_salon_, where the window resisted all our efforts for some little time,\r\nand then opened upon such a choice assortment of abominations, that I\r\nfled without my baggage. The next attempt she made was the one remaining\r\nroom of the house, the family bedroom; but that was so much worse than\r\nall, that I took final refuge on the balcony, a sort of ante-room to the\r\nhen-house. The cocks at the _auberge_ of Villaz are the loudest, the\r\nhens the most talkative, and the cats the most shaggy and presuming, I\r\nhave ever met with. Even here, however, all was not unmitigated\r\ndarkness; for they ground the coffee while the water was boiling, and\r\nthe consequent decoction was admirable. Moreover, the bread had a skin\r\nof such thickness and impervious toughness, that the inside was\r\npresumably clean.\r\n\r\nAviernoz lay about an hour farther. Almost as soon as I left Villaz,\r\nthe thunderstorm came on in earnest, with sheets of rain, a regular\r\n_Wolkenbruch_.[66] The rain was most refreshing; but lightning is not\r\na pleasant companion in presence of a bright ice-axe, and I was glad\r\nwhen the houses of Aviernoz came in sight. The village had the\r\nappearance of being lost; and the houses were scattered about so\r\nirregularly, that it was difficult to know which was the best point to\r\nmake for. The road studiously avoided the scattered houses, and the\r\n_Mairie_ seemed especially difficult to find. When at length it was\r\nfound, the maire, like the queen in the poets, was in the kitchen; and\r\nhe sat affably on the end of a bench and read the letter of\r\nintroduction aloud, asking me, at the conclusion, how was our friend\r\nDugravel, a man amazing in many ways. When I confessed that I had only\r\nmade the acquaintance of the amazing man the night before, and\r\ntherefore did not feel competent to give any reliable account of the\r\nstate of his health, beyond the fact that he seemed to be in\r\nexcellent spirits, the maire looked upon me evidently with great\r\nrespect, as having won so far upon a great character like Dugravel in\r\nso short a time, and determined to accompany me himself. Meantime, we\r\nmust drink some kirsch. The maire was a young man, spare and vehement.\r\nHe talked with a headlong impetuosity which caused him to be always\r\nhot, and his hair limp and errant; and at the end of each sentence\r\nthere were so many laggard halves of words to come out together, with\r\nso little breath to bring them out, that he eventuated in a stuttering\r\nscream. His clothes were of such a description, that the most\r\nspeculative Israelite would not have gone beyond copper for his\r\nwardrobe, all standing. There were two women in the house, to whom he\r\nwas exceedingly imperious: one of them received his orders and his\r\nvehemence with a certain amount of defiance, but the other was subdued\r\nand obedient, and I believe her to have been the mayoress. He poured\r\nhimself and his household at my feet, knocked a child one way and his\r\nwife another, and, from the air with which he dragged off the\r\ntablecloth they had laid, and ordered a better, and swept away the\r\nglasses because they were not clean enough--which in itself was\r\nsufficiently true,--and screamed for poached eggs for monsieur, and\r\nthen impetuously ate them himself--I fancy that he might have been\r\ntaught to play Petrucio with success.\r\n\r\nWhen we had sat for a quarter of an hour or so, a heavy-looking young\r\nman, in fustian clothes and last year's linen, came into the room, and\r\nwas introduced as the communal schoolmaster. We shook hands with much\r\nimpressment on the strength of the similarity of our professions, and\r\nthe maire explained that the new arrival acted also as his secretary,\r\nfor there was really so much writing to be done that it was beyond his\r\nown powers; and as the schoolmaster lived _en pension_ at the _Mairie_,\r\nit was very convenient. M. Rosset, the schoolmaster, stated that he had\r\nheard us, as he sat in his room, talking of the proposed visit to the\r\nglacière, and he should much wish to accompany us. We both expressed the\r\nwarmest satisfaction; but the maire suggested--how about the boys? That,\r\nM. Rosset said, was simple enough. The world would go to the school at\r\nnine o'clock, and, finding no schoolmaster, would go home again, or\r\notherwise employ itself; and he could have school on the weekly holiday,\r\nto make up for the lost day. This weekly holiday is universally on\r\nThursday, he said, because that day divides the week so well; and I\r\nfailed to persuade him that there was a commemoration intended in the\r\nchoice of that day, as in the observance of Friday and Sunday. The maire\r\nutterly refused to take a cord, on the ground that there was no\r\npossibility of such a thing being of the least use. Fortunately, I had\r\nnow my own axe, which in more able hands had mounted more than once Mont\r\nBlanc and Monte Rosa, so I had not the usual fight to procure that\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour from the _Mairie_, when we had well commenced the steep\r\nascent of the mountain-side, the maire turned suddenly round and\r\nexclaimed, 'But the inspector!' Rosset was a sallow man, but he\r\ncontrived to turn white, while M. Métral (the maire) explained to me\r\nthat the inspector of schools was to visit Aviernoz that day. The\r\nschoolmaster recovered before long, and said he should inform the\r\ninspector that a famous _savant_ had come from England, and required\r\nthat the maire and the _instituteur_ should accompany him to the\r\nglacière, to aid him in making scientific observations. In order that he\r\nmight have documentary proof to advance, he asked for my card, and made\r\nme write on it my college and university in full.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, the maire's style of talking required a good\r\ndeal of breath, and so it was not unnatural that the ascent should\r\nreduce him to silence. The schoolmaster talked freely about scholastic\r\naffairs, and gave me an account of the ordinary tariff in village\r\nschools, though each commune may alter the prices of its school if it\r\nplease. Under seven years of age, children pay 4 francs a year, or, for\r\nshorter periods than a year, at the rate of 75 centimes a month; between\r\nseven and thirteen, 6 francs a year, or 1 franc a month; from thirteen\r\nto eighteen, 8 francs a year, or 1 f. 50 c. a month. There is the same\r\ndifficulty in France, of course, as with us, in keeping children at\r\nschool after they are old enough to earn a few centimes by\r\ncattle-keeping; and the Ministry of Education had shortly before\r\naddressed questions to every schoolmaster in the country, asking what\r\nremedy each could suggest. My present friend had replied, that if the\r\nGovernment would give the education gratis, something might be done; but\r\nhe had expressed his opinion that nothing short of an actual subsidy to\r\nparents of children beyond eight or nine years of age would ensure a\r\ngeneral improvement.\r\n\r\nHaving given me this information, he observed that it was every man's\r\nbusiness to learn, though he and I might be teachers also, and therefore\r\nhe was sure monsieur would pardon him if he asked what those black\r\npatches on monsieur's hands might mean,--pointing to certain large areas\r\nof Epsom plaster which covered the tokens of many glacières. When his\r\nmind was set at rest as to this phenomenon, the maire called a halt, and\r\ntook his turn of talking. He began to tell me about himself and his\r\nwealth, Rosset backing him up and putting in the most telling parts. He\r\nhad very extensive property, and the more level parts of it were\r\ncertainly valuable, consisting of 200 _journaux_ of good arable land:\r\nthe forests through which we walked were his, and he possessed three\r\n_montagnes_ and châlets higher up on the mountain. The glacière was his\r\nown property; and two years ago he had discovered another in the\r\nneighbourhood, which he had not since visited. He was assisted in his\r\ncapacity of maire by twelve councillors--in a larger commune it would\r\nhave been fifteen--and the council met four times in the year. If it was\r\ndesirable that they should meet on any other occasion, he must write to\r\nthe prefect of the arrondissement for permission, specifying the\r\nbusiness which they wished to conduct, and to this specified business\r\nthey must confine themselves entirely. Then he wished to know, had we\r\nmaires such as he in England? Hereupon I drew a fancy picture of the\r\nLord Mayor of London, receiving the Queen and the Royal Family in\r\ngeneral in a friendly way, and giving them a dinner,--which, he\r\nobserved, must cost a good deal, a great deal. However, he looked round\r\nupon his fields and houses and mountains, and seemed to think that he\r\ncould himself stand a considerable drain upon his purse for the\r\nreception of royalty; and possibly he is now anxious that the Emperor\r\nshould pass that way, during the five years to which the tenure of the\r\nmayoralty is restricted. Both of my companions were strong in their\r\nFrench sympathies--the one because under the new rule all communal\r\naffairs were so much better organised, the other because a wonderful\r\nchange for the better had taken place in the government superintendence\r\nof schools. Theirs was formerly an odd corner of a kingdom that did not\r\ncare much about them, and was not homogeneous; it was now an integral\r\npart of a well-ordered empire. They confessed that the present state of\r\nthings cost them much more in taxes, &c., excepting in the upper\r\nmountains, where Rosset had a cousin who paid even less than under\r\nSardinian rule.\r\n\r\nOf course, we talked a little on Church questions; and they were\r\nastonished to hear that I was not only an ecclesiastic, but an ordained\r\npriest,--a sort of thing which they had fancied did not exist in the\r\nEnglish Church. Rosset said the _curés_ of small communes had about £40\r\na year, but I must have more than that, or I could not afford to travel\r\nso far from home. Had I already said the mass that morning? Had I my\r\nrobes in the _sac_ I had left at the _Mairie_? Was the red book they had\r\nseen in my hands (Bädeker's _Schweiz_) a Breviary? They branched off to\r\nmatters of doctrine, and discussed them warmly; but some things they so\r\naccommodatingly understated, and others they stated so fairly, that I\r\nwas able to tell them they were excellent Anglicans.\r\n\r\nHigher up in the forest, we were nearly overwhelmed by a party of\r\ncharcoal-porters, who came down with their _traîneaux_ like a black\r\navalanche. A _traîneau_ is nothing more than a wooden sledge, on two\r\nrunners, which are turned up in front, to the height of a yard, to keep\r\nthe cargo in its place. In the more level parts the porter is obliged to\r\ndrag this, but on the steep zigzags its own weight is sufficient to send\r\nit down; and here the porter places himself in front, with his back\r\nleaning against the sacks of charcoal and the turned-up runners, and the\r\nwhole mass descends headlong, the man's legs going at a wild pace, and\r\nnow one foot, now the other, steering a judicious course at the turns of\r\nthe zigzags. The charcoal is made by Italians, who live on polenta and\r\ncheese high up in the mountains, and bring their manufacture down to a\r\ncertain distance, after which the porters take it in charge. The men we\r\nsaw told us that by hard work they could make four journeys in the day,\r\nearning a franc by each; out of which, as they said, they must support\r\nstomach and boots, one journey making them ready for a meal, and eight\r\njourneys finishing a pair of soles.\r\n\r\nIt cost us an hour and a half to reach the maire's first châlet, where\r\nwe were to lunch on such food as the old woman who managed it might have\r\non hand; that is to say, possibly bread, and, beyond that, milk only, in\r\nsome shape or other. The forms under which milk can be taught to appear\r\nare manifold. A young Swiss student, who in the madness of his passion\r\nfor beetle-hunting had spent fifteen days in a small châlet at\r\nAnzeindaz, sleeping each night on the hay,[67] gave me, some time\r\nsince, a list of the various foods on which he lived and grew fat. The\r\nfollowing is the _carte_, as he arranged it:--\r\n\r\nViandes.                        Vins.\r\n\r\nDu séret.                       Du lait de vache.[68]\r\n\r\nDu caillé.                      Du lait froid.\r\n\r\nDu beurre.                      Du lait de chèvre.\r\n\r\nDu fromage gras.                Petit lait.\r\n\r\nDu fromage mi-gras.             De la crême.\r\n\r\nDu fromage maigre.              Du lait de beurre.[69]\r\n\r\nTome de vache.                  Petit lait de chèvre.\r\n\r\nTome de chèvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pour les Cochons_.\r\n\r\nDu lait gâté.\r\n\r\nCuite.\r\n\r\nSome of the solids and fluids in the earlier part of this _carte_ we\r\nfelt tolerably sure of finding at the maire's châlet, and accordingly\r\nany amount of cream and _séret_ proved to be forthcoming. The maire\r\nasserted that _cérac_ was the true name of this recommendable article\r\nof food, _céré_ being the patois for the original word. Others had\r\ntold us that the real word was _serré_, meaning _compressed_ curds;\r\nbut the French writers who treat learnedly of cheese-making in the\r\n_Annales de Chimie_ adopt the form _sérets_; and in the _Annales\r\nScientifiques de l'Auvergne_ I find both _seret_ and _serai_, from the\r\nLatin _serum_. There was also bread, which arrived when we were\r\nsitting down to our meal: it had been baked in a huge ring, for\r\nconvenience of carriage, and was brought up from the low-lands on a\r\nstick across a boy's shoulder. When the old woman thought it safe to\r\nexpose a greater dainty to our attacks, at a later period of the meal,\r\nshe brought out a pot of _caillé_, a delightful luxury which prevails\r\nin the form of nuggets of various size floating in sour whey. Owing to\r\na general want of table apparatus, we placed the pot of caillé on a\r\nbroken wall, and speared the nuggets with our pocket-knives.\r\n\r\nAfter the meal, the two Frenchmen found themselves wet and exceedingly\r\ncold; for Frenchmen have not yet learned the blessing of flannel shirts\r\nunder a broiling sun. They set to work to dry themselves after an\r\noriginal fashion. The fire was little more than a collection of\r\nsmouldering embers, confined within three stone walls about a foot high;\r\nso they took each a one-legged stool--_chaises des vaches_, or _chaise\r\ndes montagnes_--and attached themselves to the stools by the usual\r\nleathern bands round the hips; then they cautiously planted the prods of\r\nthe stools in the middle of the embers, maintaining an unstable\r\nequilibrium by resting their own legs on the top of the walls. Here they\r\nsat, smoking and being smoked, till they were dry and warm. Of course,\r\nin case of a slip or an inadvertent movement, they would have gone\r\nsprawling into the fire. A well-known Swiss botanist, who has seen many\r\nstrange sleeping-places in the course of sixty years of flower-hunting\r\nin the mountains of Vaud and Valais, has told me that on one occasion he\r\nhad reached with great difficulty the only châlet in the neighbourhood\r\nof his day's researches, at a late hour of the night, the whole mountain\r\nbeing soaked with rain. It was a little upland châlet, which the people\r\nhad deserted for the autumn and winter; and meantime a mud avalanche had\r\ntaken possession, and covered the floor to a depth of several inches. No\r\nplank was to be found for lying on; but he discovered a broken\r\none-legged stool, and on this he sat and slept, propped as well as might\r\nbe in a corner. It is difficult to say which would be worse--a fall from\r\nthe stool by daylight into the embers of a wood fire, or the shuddering\r\nslimy waking about midnight, after a nod more vigorous than the rest, to\r\nfind oneself plunged in eight cold inches of soft mud.\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour beyond the châlet, we found the mouth of the\r\nglacière, on a large plateau almost bare of vegetation, and showing the\r\nlive rock at the surface. They told me that in a strong winter there\r\nwould be an average of 12 feet of snow on the ground here.[70] The\r\nglacière itself is approached by descending one side of a deep pit,\r\nwhose circumference is larger than that of any other of the\r\npit-glacières I have seen. A few yards off there is a smaller shaft in\r\nthe rock, which we afterwards found to communicate with the glacière.\r\nThe NW. side of the larger pit, being the side at the bottom of which is\r\nthe arch of entrance, is vertical, and we spent the time necessary for\r\ngrowing cool in measuring the height of this face of rock from above.\r\nThe plummet ran out 115 feet of string, and struck the slope of snow,\r\ndown which the descent to the cave must be made, about 6 feet above the\r\njunction of the snow with the floor of the glacière, which was visible\r\nfrom the S. side of the edge of the pit; so that the total depth from\r\nthe surface of the rock to the ice-floor was 121 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERTICAL SECTION OF THE GLACIÈRE OF GRAND ANU, NEAR\r\nANNECY.]\r\n\r\nWhen we were sufficiently cool, we scrambled down the side of the pit\r\nopposite to that in which the archway lies, finding the rock extremely\r\nsteep, and then came to a slope of 72 feet of snow, completely exposed\r\nto the weather, which landed us at the mouth of the glacière. The arch\r\nis so large, that we could detect the change of light in the cave,\r\ncaused by the passage of clouds across the sun, and candles were not\r\nnecessary, excepting in the pits shortly to be described. We saw at once\r\nthat rapid thaw was going on somewhere or other; and when we stepped off\r\nthe snow, we found ourselves in a couple of inches of soft green\r\nvegetable mud, like a _compote_ of dark-coloured duckweed--or, to use a\r\nmore familiar simile, like a mass of overboiled and ill-strained\r\nspinach. To the grief of one of us, there was ice under this, of most\r\npersuasive slipperiness. The maire said that he had never seen these\r\nsigns of thaw in his visits in previous years; and as we went farther\r\nand farther into the cave, he was more and more surprised at each step\r\nto find such a large quantity of running water, and so much less ice\r\nthan he had expected. The shape of the glacière is a rough circle, 60\r\nfeet in diameter; and the floor, which is solid ice, slopes gradually\r\ndown to the farther end. The immediate entrance is half-closed by a\r\nsteep and very regular cone of snow, lying vertically under the small\r\nshaft we had seen in the rock above. The snow which forms the cone\r\ndescends in winter by this shaft; and the formation must have been going\r\non for a considerable time, since the lower part of the cone has become\r\nsolid ice, under the combined influences of pressure and of _dégel_ and\r\n_regel_. I climbed up the side of this, by cutting steps in the lower\r\npart, and digging feet and hands deep into the snow higher up; and I\r\nfound the length of the side to be 30 feet. I had no means of\r\ndetermining the height of the cave, and a guess might not be of much\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, the farther end of the cave was the most striking. The\r\nwater which comes from the melting snow down which we had passed in\r\nreaching the glacière, had cut itself deep channels in the floor, and\r\nthrough these it coursed rapidly till it precipitated itself into a\r\nlarge pit or _moulin_ in the ice, at the lowest point. This pit, a will\r\nbe seen by the section of the cave given on p. 174,[71] terminates the\r\nglacière; and the rock-wall at the farther edge falls away into a sort\r\nof open fissure, down which magnificent cascades of ice stream\r\nemulously, clothing that side of the pit, which would otherwise be solid\r\nrock. We cut a few steps about the upper edge of this _moulin_, to make\r\nall safe, and proceeded to let down a lighted candle, which descended\r\nsafely for 36 feet, showing nothing but ice on all sides; it then came\r\nin contact with one of the falls of water, and the light was of course\r\nextinguished. We next tied a stone to the string, and found that after\r\n40 feet it struck on ice and turned inwards, under our feet, stopping\r\nfinally at the end of 51 feet; but whether it was really the bottom of\r\nthe pit that stopped it, or only some ledge or accidental impediment, we\r\ncould not determine. The diameter of this pit might be 3 yards, but we\r\ntook no measure of it.\r\n\r\nAt the extreme right of the cave we found another pit, a yard and a\r\nhalf across, two-thirds of the circumference of which was formed by\r\nthe plateau of ice on which we stood, and the remaining third by a\r\nfluting in the wall of rock. The maire said that, two years ago, this\r\nhole was not visible, being concealed by a large ice-column which had\r\nsince fallen in. Here again I let down a lighted candle, with more\r\nhopes of getting it to the bottom, as no part of the cave drained into\r\nthe pit. The candle descended steadily, the flame showing no signs of\r\natmospheric disturbance, and revealing the fact that the opposite side\r\nof the pit, viz. the rock, which alone was visible from our position,\r\nbecame more and more thickly covered with ice, of exquisite clearness,\r\nand varied and most graceful forms. As foot after foot, and yard after\r\nyard, ran out, and our heads craned farther and farther over the edge\r\nof the pit to follow the descending light, (we lay flat on the ice,\r\nfor more safety,) the cries of the schoolmaster became mere howls, and\r\nthe maire lapsed into oaths heavy enough to break in the ice. It is\r\nalways sufficiently disagreeable to hear men swear; but in situations\r\nwhich have anything impressive, either of danger or of grandeur, it\r\nbecomes more than ever unbearable. I remember on one occasion\r\nover-taking a large party in the descent from the Plateau to the\r\nGrands Mulets, in a place where the snow was extremely soft, and any\r\nmoment might land one of us in a crevasse; and I shall never forget\r\nthe oaths which caught my ear, from a floundering fellow-countryman\r\nenveloped from the waist downwards.\r\n\r\nWhen 60 feet had run out, the candle stopped, and on stretching over I\r\nsaw that it had reached a slope of ice which inclined very steeply\r\nnorthwards, and passed away under the rock, apparently into a fresh\r\ncavern. By raising the candle slightly and then letting it drop, we made\r\nit glide down this slope for 8 feet; and then it finally rested on a\r\nshelf of ice, showing us the shadowy beginnings of what should be a most\r\nglorious ice-cave. The little light which the candle gave was made the\r\nmost of by the reflecting material which surrounded it; and we were able\r\nto see that the archway in the rock was rounded off with grey ice, and\r\nrested, as it were, on icy pillars. As far as we could judge, there\r\nwould have been abundant room to pass down the slope under the archway,\r\nif only the preliminary 60 feet could by any means have been\r\naccomplished; and I shall dream for long of what there must be down\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAs I was anxious to know whether the side of the pit was vertical ice\r\nunder our feet, I contrived to get about a third of the way round the\r\nedge, so as almost to reach the fluting in the rock which formed the\r\nfarther side of the pit, and then desired the schoolmaster to raise the\r\ncandle slowly from the ledge on which it still rested. As he pulled it\r\ngradually up, I was startled to find that the ice fell away sharply\r\nimmediately below the spot where we had been collected, and then formed\r\na solid wall; so that we had been standing on the mere edge of a shelf,\r\nwith nothing but black emptiness below. How far the solid wall receded\r\nat the bottom I was unable to determine, for the light of one candle was\r\nof very little use at so great a distance, and in darkness so profound.\r\nI persuaded the maire to make an effort to reach a point from which he\r\ncould see the insecurity of the ice which had seemed to form so solid a\r\nfloor; and he was so much impressed by what he saw, that he fled with\r\nprecipitation from the cave, and we eventually found him asleep under a\r\nbush on the rocks above. In reaching the farther side of the pit, we\r\ncrossed unwittingly an ice-bridge formed by a transverse pit or tunnel\r\nin the ice, which opened into the pit we were examining. The maire\r\nafterwards promised to rail off all that end of the glacière, and forbid\r\nhis workmen to venture upon it. Considering that the hole itself was\r\nonly opened two years before by the fall of a column, and has already\r\nundergone such changes, I shall be surprised if the ice-bridge, and all\r\nthat part on which we lay to fathom the pit, does not fall in before\r\nvery long; and then, by means of steps and ropes and ladders, it may be\r\npossible to reach the entrance to the lower cave, 190 feet below the\r\nsurface of the earth. May I be there to see![72]\r\n\r\nThe left side of the glacière, near the entrance, was occupied by a\r\ncolumnar cascade, behind which I forced a passage by chopping away some\r\nlovely ornaments of ice. Here also the solid ground-ice falls away a\r\nlittle under the surface, leaving a cavern 8 or 9 feet deep, on the rock\r\nside of which every possible glacial fantasy was to be found. The\r\nstalactites here presented the peculiar prismatic structure so often\r\nnoticed; but on the more exposed side of the column they were tipped\r\nwith limpid ice, free from all apparent external or internal lines. This\r\nreminded me of what we had observed in the Glacière of La Genollière,\r\nnamely, that the surface-lines tended to disappear under thaw; so I cut\r\na piece of prismatic ice and put it in my mouth. In a short time it\r\nbecame perfectly limpid, and on breaking it up I could discover no signs\r\nof prism. On some parts of the floor of the glacière, the ice was\r\napparently unprismatic, generally in connection with running water or\r\nother marks of thaw; but, to my surprise, I found that it split into\r\nprisms very readily.\r\n\r\nThe maire could not understand how it was that, after a winter\r\nespecially severe, as that of 1863-4 had been, there should be even less\r\nice than in the preceding summer, and we could see the marks of last\r\nyear's cutting, down to the edge of the _moulin_. He said that they had\r\nnever before cut down in that direction; but in the summer of 1863 they\r\nhad been so much struck by the clearness of the ice which formed the\r\nfloor, that they had cut it freely, and removed a large quantity. This,\r\nI believe, was the cause of the absence of any great amount of fresh\r\nice. The slope of the whole ice-floor is considerable, and the workmen\r\nincreased the slope by cutting away the ice in the neighbourhood of the\r\nedge of the _moulin_: they had also, as we could see quite plainly,\r\nexcavated the clearer parts of the ice between the entrance to the cave\r\nand the _moulin_, so that a sort of trough ran down from near the foot\r\nof the snow to the pit at the lower end of the glacière. When we were\r\nthere, the water rushed down this trough, and was lost in the pit; and\r\nvery probably the same may have been the case in the earlier parts of\r\nthe year, when, according to the view I have already expressed, the ice\r\nwould under ordinary circumstances have been formed. If this be so, the\r\ncaverns below must have received immense additions to their stores of\r\nice or water. We observed, by the way, that the slope of ice to which\r\nthe candle descended in the deeper pit, and the shelf on which it\r\nrested, were quite dry, or at any rate free from all apparent signs of\r\nthe abundant water we should have seen, had that been the outlet for the\r\nstreams which poured into the _moulin_. The maire said that the columns\r\nand cascades of ice in the cave had been much more beautiful in the\r\nprevious summer.\r\n\r\nThe whole cavern would thus appear to be something of the shape of an\r\negg, with the longer axis vertical, and the entrance about half-way up\r\nthe side. The lower end of this egg-shaped cavity in the rock is filled\r\nwith ice, which in some parts shrinks from the rock below the surface,\r\nthough, as far as outward appearance goes, it fills the cavern to its\r\nfarthest corners. The depth of this ice at one side is 60 feet, and how\r\nmuch more it may be in the middle it is impossible to say. As we have\r\nseen, there is a second ice-cave opening out of the principal one, at a\r\ndepth of 190 feet below the surface; and with respect to this second\r\ncave imagination may run riot. Rosset told me that he had noticed, the\r\nyear before, a strong source of water springing out of the side of a\r\nrock, at some little distance from the glacière; but he could not reach\r\nit then, and could not find it now. This may possibly be the drainage of\r\nthe glacière in its summer state.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer stood at 34° in the middle of the cave; and though the\r\nothers felt the cold very much, I was myself surprised to find so low a\r\nregister, for the atmosphere seemed to be comparatively warm, judging\r\nfrom what I had experienced in other glacières. The only current of air\r\nwe could detect was exceedingly slight, and came from the deeper of the\r\ntwo pits in the ice. It was so slight, that the flame of the candle\r\nburned apparently quite steadily when we were engaged in determining the\r\ndepth and shape of the pit.\r\n\r\nThe sun had by this time produced such an effect upon the slope of snow\r\noutside the glacière, that we found the ascent sufficiently difficult,\r\nespecially as our hands were full of various instruments. The\r\nschoolmaster was not content to choose the straight line up, and in\r\nattempting to perform a zigzag, he came to a part of the slope where the\r\nsnow lay about 2 inches thick on solid ice, and the result was an\r\nunscholastic descent in inverted order of precedence. He got on better\r\nover the rolling stones after the snow was accomplished, but the clumsy\r\nstyle of his climbing dislodged an unpleasant amount and weight of\r\nmissiles; and though he was amiable enough to cry '_Garde_!' with every\r\nstep he took, it will be found by experiment that it is not much use to\r\nthe lower man to have '_Garde_!' shouted in his ears, when his footing\r\nis insecure to begin with, and a large stone comes full at his head, at\r\nthe precise moment when two others are taking him in the pit of the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nWe found the maire, as was said, asleep under a bush near the mouth of\r\nthe pit; and he pronounced himself completely recovered from the effects\r\nof the cold, and ready to guide us to a second glacière. He told us that\r\nthe amount of ice he sold averaged 4,000 _quintaux métriques_ a week,\r\nfor the three months of July, August, and September; but the last winter\r\nhad been so severe, that the lake had provided ice for the artificial\r\nglacières of Annecy, and no one had as yet applied to him this year. As\r\nonly a fortnight of his usual season had passed, he may have since had\r\nplenty of applications, later in the year. The railways have opened up\r\nmore convenient sources of ice for Lyons, and for some time he has sent\r\nnone to that town.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: A Yorkshire farmer unconsciously adapts the German\r\n_Wolkenbruch_, declaring on occasion that the rain is so heavy, it is\r\n'ommust as if a clood had brussen someweers.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: I tried the hay in this châlet one night, with such\r\nresults that the next time I slept there, two years after, I preferred a\r\ncombination of planks.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: _i.e._ New milk, warm.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Otherwise graphically called _battu_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: I had no means of determining the elevation of the ground.\r\nThe fact of 12 feet of snow is of no value as a guide to the height.\r\nLast winter (1864-5) there was 26 feet of snow on the Jura, at a height\r\nof less than 4,000 feet, and the position of some of the larger châlets\r\nwas only marked by a slight boss on the plane surface.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: In the section of the cave, I have brought out the deeper\r\npit from the side into the middle, so as to show both in one section: I\r\nhave also slightly shaded the pits, instead of leaving them blank like\r\nshafts in the rock.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: I have made arrangements for completing the exploration of\r\nthis cave, and the one which is next described, in the course of the\r\npresent summer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE OF CHAPPET-SUR-VILLAZ, ON THE MONT PARMELAN, NEAR ANNECY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe started southwards from the Glacière of _Grand Anu_, for such they\r\nsaid was the proper name for the cave last described, and passed over\r\nsome of the wildest walking I have seen. All the most striking features\r\nof a glacier were here reproduced in stone: now narrow deep crevasses\r\nwhich only required a slight spring; now much more formidable rents,\r\nwhich we were obliged to circumvent by a détour; now dark mysterious\r\nholes with vertical shell-like partitions at various depths; and now a\r\nperfect _moulin_, with fluted sides and every detail appertaining to\r\nthose remarkable pits, the hollow plunge of falling water alone\r\nexcepted. In other parts, the smooth slab-like appearance of the surface\r\nreminded me of a curious district on one of the summits of the Jura,\r\nwhere the French frontier takes the line of crest, and the old stones\r\nmarked with the _fleur-de-lys_ and the Helvetic cross are still to be\r\nfound. In those border regions the old historic distinctions are still\r\nremembered, and the frontier Vaudois call the neighbouring French\r\n_Bourguignons_--or, in their patois, _Borgognons_. They keep up the\r\ntradition of old hatreds; and the strange bleak summit, with its smooth\r\nslabs of Jura-chalk lying level with the surface, is so much like a vast\r\ncemetery, that the wish in old times has been father to the thought, and\r\nthey call it still the Cemetery of the Burgundians, _Cimetiros ai\r\nBorgognons_.[73]\r\n\r\nAfter a time, we reached a tumbled chaos of rock, much resembling the\r\nice-fall of a glacier, and, on descending, and rounding a low spur of\r\nthe mountain so as to take a north-westerly course, we found ourselves\r\nin a perfect paradise of flowers. One orchis I shall always regret.\r\nThere seemed to be only a single head, closely packed with flowerets,\r\nand strongly scented; it was a pure white, not the green and\r\nstraw-coloured white of other scented orchises. There were large patches\r\nof the delicate _faux-lis (Paradisia liliastrum)_; and though there\r\nmight not be anything very rare, and the lovely glacier-flowers were of\r\ncourse wanting, the whole was a rich feast for anyone who cares more for\r\ndelicacy and colour than for botany.\r\n\r\nThe maire told us that he had found the glacière, for which we were now\r\nin search, two years before, when he accompanied the government surveyor\r\nto show him the forests and mountains which formed his property. As he\r\nhad on that occasion approached the spot from the other side, we walked\r\na long way to place him exactly where the surveyor and he had crossed\r\nthe ridge of the mountain, and then started him down from the Col in the\r\ndirection they had taken. He was certain of two things: first, that\r\nthey had passed by the Col between the Mont Parmelan and the Montagne de\r\nl'Eau; and, secondly, that the glacière was within five minutes of the\r\nhighest point of the Col. For three-quarters of an hour we all broke our\r\nshins, and the officials the Third Commandment. They invoked more saints\r\nthan I had ever heard of, and, in default, did not scruple to appeal\r\nwith shocking volubility to darker aid. It was all of no use,--and well\r\nit might be; for when we had given it up in despair, after long patience\r\nand a considerable period of the contrary, and had descended for half an\r\nhour in the direction of a third glacière, I chanced to look back, and\r\nsaw that the Col in the neighbourhood of which we had been searching lay\r\nbetween two points of the Montagne de l'Eau; while the true Col between\r\nthat mountain and the Mont Parmelan lay considerably to the west. When\r\nit appears that a guide has probably made a mistake, the only plan is to\r\nassume quietly that it is so, as if it were a matter of no consequence,\r\nand then he may sometimes be decoyed into allowing the fact: I therefore\r\npointed out to the maire the true Col, and told him that was the one by\r\nwhich he had passed southwards, when he found the glacière; to which,\r\nwith unnecessary strength of language, he at once assented. But all my\r\nefforts to take him back were unavailing. Nothing in the world should\r\ncarry him up the mountain again, now that he had happily got so far\r\ndown. I worked his best and his worst feelings with equal want of\r\nsuccess; even national jealousy failed, and he was content to know that\r\na French maire had not pluck to face three-quarters of an hour of\r\nclimbing, when an English priest was ready to lead the way. The\r\nschoolmaster declined to go alone with me, on the ground that neither of\r\nus knew the mountain, and threatening clouds were gathering all around.\r\nWhen, at last, I proposed to go by myself, they became menacingly\r\nobstructive, and declared that I should certainly not be allowed to\r\nface the intricacy of the mountain in a fog. Besides, as the maire put\r\nit, he was sure of the way to the third glacière; and if I were to go up\r\nalone to look for the second, I should lose a certainty for a chance, as\r\nthere was not time to visit both. So with an ill grace I continued the\r\ndescent with them, being restored to good humour before long by the\r\nbeauty of the Lake of Annecy, as seen from our elevated position.\r\n\r\nIt is so impossible to accept in full the accounts one picks up of\r\nnatural curiosities, that I give the maire's description of the stray\r\nglacière only for what it is worth. It was not extracted without much\r\nlaborious cross-examination--_sais paw vous le dire_ being the average\r\nanswer to my questions. The entrance to the cave is about twice as high\r\nas a man, and is in a small shallow basin of rock and grass. The floor\r\nis level with the entrance, and the roof rises inside to a good height.\r\nIn shape it is like a Continental bread-oven; and at the time of the\r\nmaire's visit, the floor was a confused mass of ice and stones, the\r\nformer commencing at the very entrance. There was no ice except on the\r\nfloor, the area of which might be as large as that of the surface of the\r\nice in the Glacière of Grand Anu. No pit was to be seen, and not a drop\r\nof water. Snow could have drifted in easily, but they saw no signs of\r\nany remaining. If this account be true, especially with respect to the\r\nposition of the entrance and the horizontal direction of the floor, I\r\nhave seen no glacière like it.\r\n\r\nWe descended for a time through fir-woods, and then again down steep and\r\nbarren rocks, till we reached the sharp slope of grass which so\r\nfrequently connects the base of a mountain with the more civilised\r\nforests and the pasturages below. The maire led us for some distance\r\nalong the top of this grass slope, towards the west, skirting the rocks\r\ntill they became precipitous and lofty, when he said we must be near\r\nour point. Still we went on and on without seeing any signs of it, and\r\nour guide seemed in despair; and I, for one, entirely gave up the third\r\ncave to the same fate as the second, and became very sulky and\r\nremonstrative. The entrance to the glacière, the maire told us, was a\r\nhole in the face of the highest rocks, 3 or 4 yards only above the\r\ngrass; and as we had now reached a part of the mountain where the rock\r\nsprings up smooth and high, and we could command the whole face, and yet\r\nsaw nothing, the schoolmaster came over to my side, and told the maire\r\nhe was a humbug. However, we were then within a few yards of the desired\r\nspot, and half-a-dozen steps showed us a small _cheminée_, down\r\nwhich a strong and icy current of wind blew. The maire shouted a shout\r\nof triumph, and climbed the _cheminée_; and when we also had done the\r\nnecessary gymnastics, we found a hole facing almost due north, all\r\nwithin being dark. The current blew so determinedly, that matches were\r\nof no use, and I was obliged to seek a sheltered corner before I could\r\nlight a candle; and, when lighted, the candle was with difficulty kept\r\nfrom being blown out. No ice was visible, nor any signs of such a\r\nthing,--nothing but a very irregular narrow cave, with darkness at the\r\nfarther end. As we advanced, we found that the floor of the cave came to\r\na sudden end, and the darkness developed into a strange narrow fissure,\r\nwhich reached out of sight upwards, and out of sight below; and down\r\nthis the maire rolled stones, saying that _there_ was the glacière, if\r\nonly one could get at it without a _tourneau_. Considering the\r\npersistency with which he had throughout declared that there was no\r\npossible need for a rope, I gave him some of my mind here, in that\r\nsoftened style which his official dignity demanded; but he excused\r\nhimself by saying that the gentleman who owned the glacière, and\r\nextracted the ice for private use only, was now living at his summer\r\nchâlet, a mile or two off, and he, the maire, had felt confident that\r\nthe _tourneau_ would have been fitted up for the season.\r\n\r\nOn letting a candle down from the termination of the floor, we found\r\nthat the perpendicular drop was not more than 12 feet, and from the\r\nshelf thus reached it seemed very possible to descend to the farther\r\ndepths of the fissure; but I had become so sceptical, that I persisted\r\nin asserting that there was no ice below. The maire's manner, also, was\r\nstrange, and I suspected that the cold current of air had caused the\r\nplace to be called a glacière, with any other qualification on the part\r\nof the cave. One thing was evident,--no snow could reach the fissure. M.\r\nMétrai was determined that I must not attempt the descent, pointing out,\r\nwhat was quite true, that though the fall was not great, there seemed no\r\npossibility of getting back up the smooth rock. His arguments increased\r\nmy suspicions; so, leaving all apparatus behind, I dropped down to join\r\nthe candle, rather hoping to have the satisfaction of sending them off\r\nfor a rope, in case I could not achieve the last few feet in returning,\r\nand knowing that there was no danger of the fate which once threatened\r\nthe chamois-hunting Kaiser Max.[74]\r\n\r\nThe drop turned out to be a mere nothing, and, taking the candle, I\r\nscrambled on, down the sloping floor of the fissure, towards the heart\r\nof the mountain, expecting every moment that my further passage would be\r\nstopped by solid rock. But, after reaching a part so narrow that I was\r\nobliged to mount by both sides at once in order to get past it, I found\r\na commodious gallery, opening out into a long and narrow and very lofty\r\ncavern, still only a fissure, the floor of which continued the regular\r\nand rapid slope down which I had so far come. A short way farther down,\r\nan opening appeared to the left; and I turned off the main passage into\r\na horizontal gallery or chamber, with a floor of ice resting on rock and\r\nstones. This chamber seemed to be 3 or 4 yards wide at the entrance,\r\nnarrowing regularly to 4 1/2 feet. It was 40 feet long, and at the\r\nfarther end, which would not have been visible from the entrance, on\r\naccount of a slight bend in the ice-gallery, even if there had been any\r\nlight, it was closed by an ice-cascade 7 yards high and 4 1/2 feet broad\r\nat the bottom. The ice of much of this cascade was so clear, that I saw\r\nthe rock upon which it rested, or in some parts did not rest, quite\r\nplainly, and the large air-cavities in the structure were beautifully\r\nshown by the richly-coloured rock behind. None of the current which we\r\nhad observed above, and which had nearly baffled my protecting care of\r\nthe candle during the descent, came from this gallery; but I find it\r\nwritten in my notes that the gallery was _very_ cold. Thaw was going on,\r\nrather rapidly; and the water stole out by the entrance, and ran down\r\nthe main descent, over ice and among rocks, into the farther darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen I came out again from this gallery, I mounted the slope towards my\r\ncompanions, and tried to tempt them down. The maire felt himself to be\r\ntoo valuable to his country to be lightly risked, and declined to come;\r\nbut Rosset took a bold heart, and dropped, after requiring from me a\r\nsolemn promise that I would give him a back for his return up the rock.\r\nWe visited the gallery I had already explored, and, as we stood admiring\r\nthe cascade of ice, a skilful drop of water came from somewhere, and\r\nextinguished our only candle. My matches were with the maire; and I was\r\nequally sure that he would not bring them down to us, and that we could\r\nnot go up to fetch them without a light. Rosset, however, very\r\nfortunately, had a box in his pocket for smoking purposes; and we cut\r\noff the wet wick, and cut down the composition to form another, and so\r\ncontrived to light the candle again. While we were thus engaged, I\r\nchanced to look up for a moment, and saw far above our heads a small\r\nopening in the roof, through which a few rays of light entered from the\r\nouter world. It was so very far above us, that the uncertain rays were\r\nlost long before they got down to our level, being absorbed in the\r\nuniversal darkness, and being in fact rather suggested than visible even\r\nat their strongest. Those who have been at Lauterbrunnen in a very dry\r\nseason, will understand how these rays presented the appearance of a\r\nghostly Staubbach of unreal light. We must have been at an immense depth\r\nbelow the surface in which the opening lay; and if there had been a long\r\nday before us, it would have been curious to search for the fissure\r\nabove. Sir Thomas Browne says, in the _Religio Medici,_ 'Conceive light\r\ninvisible, and that is a spirit.' We very nearly saw a spirit here.\r\n\r\nThe descent from the mouth of this chamber to the deeper recesses of the\r\nmain fissure was very rough, but was speedily accomplished, and we\r\nreached a point where solid rock stopped us in face; while, to the\r\nright, a chamber with a threshold of ice was visible, and, to the left,\r\na dark opening, down which the descent appeared to continue. From this\r\nopening all the strong cold current came. We took the ice-chamber first.\r\n\r\nThe entrance had evidently been closed till very lately by a large\r\ncolumn of ice, and we passed over the débris, between rock portals and\r\non a floor of solid grey ice, into a triangular cave of any height the\r\nimagination might choose to fix. The entire floor of the cave was of\r\nice, giving the impression of infinite thickness and firmness. A little\r\nwater stood on it, near the threshold, so limpid that we could not see\r\nwhere it commenced. The base of this triangular floor we found to be 17\r\nfeet, and its altitude 30 feet; and though these dimensions may seem\r\ncomparatively small, the whole effect of the thick mass of ice on which\r\nwe stood, with the cascades of ice in the corners, and the ice-figures\r\non the walls, and the three sides of the cave passing up into sheer\r\ndarkness, was exceedingly striking, situated, as it all was, so deep\r\ndown in the bowels of the earth. The original entrance to the fissure,\r\nat the top of the _cheminée_, was, as has been said, at the base of\r\nlofty rocks, and we had descended very considerably from the entrance;\r\nso that, even without the strange light thrown upon the matter by the\r\nsmall hole overhead, through which we had seen the day struggling to\r\nforce its way into the cavern, we should have been sure that we were now\r\nat an immense distance below the surface. One corner of the cave was\r\noccupied by a broad and solid-looking cascade, while another corner\r\nshowed the opening of a very narrow fissure, curved like one of the\r\nshell-shaped crevasses of a glacier. Into this fissure the ice-floor\r\nstreamed; and Rosset held my coat-tails while I made a few steps down\r\nthe stream, when the fall became too rapid for further voluntary\r\nprogress. I let down a stone for 18 feet, when it stuck fast, and would\r\nmove neither one way nor the other. The upper wall of this fissure was\r\nclothed with moss-like ice, and ice of the prismatic structure,--with\r\nhere and there large scythe-blades, as it were, attached by the sharp\r\nedge to the rock, and lying vertically with the heel outwards. One of\r\nthese was 11 inches deep, from the heel to the rock, and only one-eighth\r\nof an inch thick at the thickest part.\r\n\r\nThe angle occupied by the cascade or column was the most striking. The\r\nbase of the column was large, and apparently solid, like a smooth\r\nunbroken waterfall suddenly frozen. It fitted into the angle of the\r\ncave, and completely filled up the space between the contiguous walls. I\r\ncommenced to chop with my axe, and before long found that this ice was\r\nhollow, though very thick; and when a sufficient hole was made for me to\r\nget through, I saw that what had looked like a column was in truth only\r\na curtain of ice hung across the angle of the cave. Within the curtain\r\nthe ice-floor still went on, streaming down at last into a fissure\r\nsomething like that in the other corner. The curtain was so low, that I\r\nwas obliged to sit on the ice inside to explore; and after a foot or two\r\nof progress, the slope towards the fissure became sufficiently great\r\nto require steps to be cut. The stream of ice turned round a bend in the\r\nfissure, very near the curtain, and was lost to view; but Rosset stood\r\nby the hole through which I had passed--on the safer side of it--and\r\ndespatched blocks of ice, which glided past me round the corner, and\r\nwent whizzing on for a long time, eventually landing upon stones, and\r\nsometimes, we fancied, in water. It is very awkward work, sitting on a\r\ngentle slope of the smoothest possible ice, with a candle in one hand,\r\nand an axe in the other, cutting each step in front; especially when\r\nthere is nothing whatever to hold by, and the slope is sufficient to\r\nmake it morally certain that in case of a slip all must go together. Of\r\ncourse, a rope would have made all safe. When I groaned over the maire's\r\nobstinacy, Rosset asked what could possibly be the use of a rope, if I\r\nwere to slip; and, to my surprise, I found that he had no idea what I\r\nwanted a rope for. When he learned that, had there been one, he would\r\nhave played a large part in the adventure, and that he might have had me\r\ndangling over an ice-fall out of sight round the corner, he added his\r\ngroans to mine, and would evidently have enjoyed it all very much. At\r\nthe same time, he was prudent, and, as each block of ice made its final\r\nplunge, he told me that was what would happen to me if I went any\r\nfarther: and, really, the pictures he drew of deep lakes of icy water\r\nand jagged points of rock, between which I must make my choice down\r\nthere, were so unpleasant, that at last I desisted, and pushed myself up\r\nbackwards, still in a sitting posture, calling Rosset and the maire the\r\nworst names I could feel justified in using. On the way, I found one of\r\nthe large brown flies which we had seen in the Glacière of La\r\nGenollière, and in the Lower Glacière of the Pré de S. Livres.\r\n\r\nRosset now told me he was so cold he could stand it no longer; but,\r\nafter a little pressure, and a declaration on my part that he should not\r\nhave a candle for going up again, he consented to remain with me while I\r\nexplored the remaining chamber, the lowest of all. This chamber may be\r\ncalled a continuation of the main passage. It is of about the same width\r\nas the highest of the three chambers, and the floor descends rapidly,\r\nthe cold current of air becoming very strong and biting as we penetrated\r\ninto the darkness. As the Genevese _savans_ seemed to believe in 'cold\r\ncurrents' as the cause of underground ice, I was naturally anxious to\r\nsee as much as possible of the state of this gallery, from which every\r\nparticle of the current seemed to come. We very soon reached a narrow\r\ndark lake, and, exclaiming that here was ice again, I stepped, not on\r\nto, but into it, and found that it was water. When our solitary candle\r\nwas brought to bear upon it, we saw that it was so clear as not in any\r\nway to impede our view, producing rather the effect of slightly-clouded\r\nspectacles upon the stones at the bottom. This lake filled up the whole\r\nbreadth of the gallery, here perhaps 4 or 5 feet, and rapidly passed to\r\nthe depth of a yard; but for a little distance there were unstable\r\nstones at one edge, and steps in the rock-wall, by which I could pass\r\non still into the darkness, supported by an alpenstock planted in the\r\nwater. The current of cold air blew along the surface of the water from\r\nthe farther extremity of the gallery, wherever that might be. As far as\r\nour eyes could reach, we saw nothing but the black channel of water,\r\nwith its precipitous sides passing up beyond our sight. It might have\r\nbeen possible to progress in a spread-eagle fashion, with one hand and\r\none foot on each side; but a fall would have been so bitterly\r\nunpleasant, that I made a show of condescension in acceding to Rosset's\r\nrequest that I would not attempt such a thing. In the course of my\r\nreturn to the rocks where he stood, I involuntarily fathomed the\r\ndepth of the lake, luckily in a shallower part, and was so much struck\r\nby the coldness of the water, that I left Rosset with the candle, and\r\nstruggled up without a light to the place where we had left the maire,\r\nor rather to the bottom of the drop from the entrance-cave, to get the\r\nthermometer. The maire was sunning himself on the rock, out of reach of\r\nthe cold current; but he came in, and let down the case, and I quickly\r\nrejoined the schoolmaster. At first, it would have been impossible to\r\nmove about without a light; but our eyes had now become to some extent\r\naccustomed to the darkness, and I had learned the difficulties of the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWhen the thermometers were suspended in the water, Rosset asked how long\r\nthey must stay there. I rashly answered, a quarter of an hour; on which\r\nhe demanded indignantly whether I supposed he meant to stay in that cold\r\nfor a quarter of an hour. He had now the candle in his own possession,\r\nand I was propped on a stone and an alpenstock in the lake, so he turned\r\nto go, vowing that he would leave me alone in the dark if I did not come\r\nout at once. There was no help for it, as the thermometer would have\r\nbeen of no use without a candle, and a step in the dark is not pleasant\r\nwhen all around is water, so I slowly drew up the thermometer and read\r\n33° F. In making final arrangements for departure, I let it lie in the\r\nwater for a few seconds longer, and it fell to 32½°; but Rosset would\r\nnot stay a moment longer, and I was obliged to be content with that\r\nresult. He made himself very easy about the matter, and said we must\r\ncall it zero; and in the evening I heard him telling the maire that the\r\ngreatest of the wonders he had missed, by his patriotic care for his\r\nneck, was a lake of water which did not freeze, though its temperature\r\nwas zero (centigrade).\r\n\r\nAmong the stones at the bottom of this water, I saw here and there\r\npatches of a furry sort of ice. I have often watched the freezing of a\r\nrapid Scotch stream, where, in the swifter parts, the ice forms first at\r\nthe bottom and gradually creeps up the larger stones till it appears on\r\nthe surface, and becomes a nucleus, round which pieces of floating ice\r\ncollect; and the substance in the glacière-lake had exactly the same\r\nappearance as the Scotch ground-ice. But it could not be the same thing\r\nin reality, for, as far as I understand the phenomenon of ground-ice,\r\nsome disturbed motion of the water is necessary, to drive down below the\r\nsurface the cold particles of water, which become ice the moment they\r\nstrike upon any solid substance shaped like fractured stone;[75] the\r\nspecific gravity of freezing water being so much less than that of water\r\nat a somewhat higher temperature, that without some disturbing cause it\r\nwould not sink to the bottom.[76] So that it seems probable that the ice\r\nat the bottom of the lake was the remains of a solid mass, of which the\r\ngreater part had been converted into water by some warm influence or\r\nother. We noticed that a little water trickled down among the stones\r\nwhich formed the slope of descent into the lowest gallery, so that\r\nperhaps the lake was a collection of water from all parts of the various\r\nramifications of the fissure. Whence came the icy wind, it is impossible\r\nto say, without further exploration. It was satisfactory to me to find\r\nthat the 'cold current' of the Genevese _savans_ was thus associated\r\nwith water, and not with ice, in the only cave in which I had detected\r\nits presence to any appreciable extent, the currents of the Glacière of\r\nMonthézy being of a totally different description.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the final rock, in ascending, I offered Rosset the\r\npromised back, but he got up well enough without it. Before leaving the\r\nentrance-cave, we inspected the thermometer which we had left to test\r\nthe temperature of the current of air, and, to my surprise, found it\r\nstanding at 48°. We saw, however, that it had been carelessly propped on\r\na piece of rock which sheltered it from the influence of the current, so\r\nI exposed it during the time occupied in arranging the bag of tapes,\r\n&c., and it fell to 36°: whether it would have fallen lower, the\r\nimpatience of Rosset has left me unable to say. If I can ever make an\r\nopportunity for visiting the Mont Parmelan again, I shall hope to take a\r\ncord, in order to investigate the mysterious corner of the triangular\r\nchamber; and I shall certainly make myself independent of shivering\r\nFrenchmen while I measure the temperature of the lake and the current of\r\nair. We met a man outside who said that he was employed by the owner, M.\r\nde Chosal of Annecy, to cut the ice; he had been down three times to the\r\nlowest gallery in different years, in the end of July, and had always\r\nfound the same collection of water there. The glacière, he told us, was\r\ndiscovered about thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe maire had basked in the sun all the time we were down below, and\r\nhe expressed himself as much pleased that we had found so much to\r\ninterest us, in spite of the miscarriage of our efforts to reach the\r\nsecond glacière. We set off down the steep grass at a scrambling\r\nsliding run, against which I was speedily obliged to protest,\r\nexplaining that a certain ugly inflammation above the left knee was\r\nbecoming worse every other step, and as the leg must last three days\r\nlonger, it would be as well to humour it. They saw the force of this\r\nreasoning, and we descended with much gravity till we came in sight of\r\nthe _Mairie_, still half an hour off, when Rosset cried out that he\r\nsmelled supper, and rushed off at an infectious pace down the\r\nremainder of the mountain-side.\r\n\r\nWe reached the _Mairie_ at six o'clock, and sat down at once 'to eat\r\nsomething.' The first course was bread and kirsch; and when that was\r\nfinished, six boiled eggs appeared, and a quart _carafe_ of white wine.\r\nThese having vanished, their place was taken by a dish of sodden\r\ncabbage, and another quart of wine; but, to save the credit of the maire\r\nand the schoolmaster, I will not say how often the former functionary\r\ndescended to the cellar with a quart pitcher, with increasing\r\nimpetuosity. Next came a dish of onions, with a pretence of\r\n_mange-tout,_ broiled brown after boiling, and served in a compound fat;\r\nand then haricots with a like condiment, and with a flavour reminiscent\r\nof the previous course. There was some talk of a _poulet_; but the bird\r\nstill lived, and the talk came to nothing. The dinner ended with the\r\nharicots, and we then relapsed into dessert, namely, bread and kirsch.\r\nThe mayoress came in with the dessert, and sat on the end of the bench,\r\nbelow the hats and the bread-tin, eating the remaining onions off the\r\ndish with the spoon of nature.\r\n\r\nDuring one of the maire's frequent visits to the cellar, I propounded\r\na question to the schoolmaster which had puzzled me for some time: Was\r\nI to pay the maire? M. Rosset said that it was certainly not\r\n_necessary_, but I had better propose it, and I should then see how M.\r\nMétral took it. This I accordingly did, when the adieux in the house\r\nhad been said, and my host was showing me the way to Thorens, where I\r\nwas to sleep, he, also, declared that it was not necessary--the\r\npleasure he had experienced in accompanying me had already fully\r\nrecompensed him: still, if I wished to reimburse him for that which I\r\nhad actually cost, he was a man reasonable, and in all cases content.\r\nI calculated that the dinner and wine which had fallen to my share\r\nwould be dear at a franc, and the day's wage of a substitute to do the\r\nmaire's neglected work could not come to much, so I boldly and\r\nunblushingly gave that great man four francs, and he said regretfully\r\nthat it was more than enough. To his son and heir--the identical boy\r\nwho had brought the ring of bread up the mountain to the châlet where\r\nwe lunched. I gave something under two-pence, for guiding me across\r\ntwo doubtful fields into a beaten track, and he expressed himself as\r\neven more content than the maire. They both told me that it was\r\nimpossible to miss the way; but I imagine that I achieved that\r\nimpossibility, as I had to walk through two streams in the deepening\r\ntwilight, and the prevailing fear of water in that region is very\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe _auberge_ at Thorens to which the maire had recommended me, as being\r\nthe best, and kept by a personal friend of his, bore the sign _à la\r\nParfaite Union_. The entry was by the kitchen, and through the steam and\r\nodour of onions, illuminated by one doubtful oil-lamp, I saw the\r\nguest-room filled with people in Sunday dress, while two fiddles played\r\neach its own tune in its own time. Nothing but the potent name of M. the\r\nMaire of Aviernoz gained me even a hearing; and, for a bed, I was\r\nobliged to stretch my intimacy with that exalted personage to the very\r\nfurthest bounds of truth. Chappaz Nicolai, whose name the maire had\r\nwritten in my note-book, that there might be no mistake, appeared to be\r\nof that peculiar mental calibre which warrants Yorkshire peasants in\r\ndescribing a man as 'half-rocked,' or 'not plumb.' His wife, on the\r\nother hand, was one of those neat, gentle, sensible women, of whom one\r\nwonders how they ever came to marry such thick-lipped and blear-eyed\r\nmen. Between them they informed me that if I did not object to share a\r\nroom, I could be taken in; otherwise--maire or no maire--not. I asked\r\nwhether they meant half a bed; but they said no, that would not be\r\nnecessary at present; and I accepted the offered moiety of accommodation,\r\nas it was now seventeen hours since I had started in the morning, and I\r\nwas not inclined to turn out in the dark to look for a whole room\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe stairs were a sort of cross between a ladder and nothing, and when\r\nwe reached the proposed room a large mastiff was in possession, who\r\nwould not let us enter till the master was summoned to expel him. The\r\nfurniture consisted of a table and five chairs, with no bed or beds. On\r\nthe chairs were various articles of clothing, blouses and garments more\r\nprofound, belonging probably to members of the party below; and on the\r\ntable, a bottle of water and a soup-plate, the pitcher and basin of the\r\nhouse. It was a mere slip of a room, with two diamond-shaped holes in\r\none wall, whose purpose I discovered when my guide opened a papered\r\ndoor, in which were the holes, and displayed two beds foot to foot in an\r\nalcove. One of these, she was sure, would be too short for me, but she\r\nfeared I must be satisfied with it, as the other was much broader and\r\nwould therefore hold the two messieurs. How the _two_? I asked, and was\r\ntold that two _pensionnaires_ lived in this room; but they were old\r\nfriends, and for one night would sleep in the same bed to oblige\r\nmonsieur. The ideas of length and breadth in connection with the beds\r\nwere entirely driven from my head by the fact of their dirtiness; and I\r\ndetermined that if the two _pensionnaires_ occupied the one, the other\r\nshould be unoccupied.\r\n\r\nAfter arranging things a little, I struggled down the steps again, and\r\nordered coffee and bread in a little room, which commanded the assembly\r\nwith the fiddles in the larger _salle_. The head waitress, busy as she\r\nwas, found time to come now and then to an open window near where I sat,\r\nand talked to a male friend sitting outside in the dark: indeed, she\r\ndid more than talk, and people had to rattle their glasses very hard\r\nbefore they could make her hear. From her I learned that this was a\r\nmarriage party which had arrived; and when I asked why they did not\r\ndance, as the fiddles were engaged at that moment with unwonted\r\nunanimity upon dance-music, she gave me to understand that these were\r\nnot people of Thorens, but only a party from another village, making the\r\nevening promenade after the wedding: from which it would seem that it is\r\nnot the etiquette for people to dance under such circumstances, except\r\nin the home village. They sat round a table, men and women alternately,\r\nwith their hats on, and with glasses before them. The bride and\r\nbridegroom were accommodated with a bench to themselves at the head of\r\nthe table, he likewise with his hat on, and with a pipe in his mouth,\r\nwhich, seeing that he was a demonstrative bridegroom, one might have\r\nsupposed to be an inconvenience. He managed very well, however, and\r\nevery one seemed contented: indeed, the pipe must, I think, be held to\r\nbe no difficulty; for the men all smoked, and yet, to judge from\r\nappearances, there was a prospect of as many marriages as there were\r\ncouples in the room. The unruffled gravity, however, and the apparent\r\nwant of zest, both in giving and receiving, which characterised the\r\nproceedings specially referred to, led me to suppose that it might be\r\nonly a part of the etiquette, and so meant nothing serious.\r\n\r\nBetween ten and eleven the fiddles and the party vanished, and I went\r\nup-stairs more determined than ever not to touch a bed, after my\r\nexperience of the room below. Three chairs were speedily arranged\r\nbetween the table and wall, and on these I lay and tried to sleep. But\r\nthe very chairs were populous, as I had found below, and sleep was\r\nimpossible. Moreover, soon after eleven, a soldier came into the room,\r\nto arrange about his breakfast with one of the maidens in the\r\nhouse. He had heard me order fresh butter for six o'clock, and he was\r\nanxious to know, whether, by breakfasting at five o'clock, he could\r\nget my butter. The chairs which formed my bed were under the lee of\r\nthe table, so that the figure recumbent on them was invisible, and the\r\ngallant soldier, under the impression that there was no one in the\r\nroom, enforced his arguments by other than conventional means. But\r\nmilitary lips, when applied personally, proved to be a rhetoric as\r\nunsuccessful as military words. The maid was platonic, and something\r\nmore than platonic; and the hero got so much the worst of it, that he\r\ngave up the battle, and changed the subject to a conscript in his\r\ncharge, who had locked himself in his bed-room and would not answer.\r\nHow was he to know whether he had the conscript safe? All this lasted\r\nsome time; and when they were gone, one of the _pensionnaires_ came\r\nin. With him I had to fight the battle of the window, which I had\r\nopened to its farthest extent. After he had got over the first\r\nsurprise and shock of finding me on the chairs instead of in the bed,\r\nfor whose comfort he vouched enthusiastically, he became confident\r\nthat it was merely out of complaisance to him and his comrade that I\r\nhad opened the window, and assured me that they really did not care\r\nfor fresh air, even if they could feel the difference in the alcove,\r\nwhich he declared they could not. As soon as that was arranged to my\r\nsatisfaction, the other _pensionnaire_ came in, and with him the\r\nbattle was fought with only half success, for he peremptorily closed\r\none side of the window. He was a particularly noisy _pensionnaire_,\r\nand shied his boots into every corner of the room before they were\r\nposed to his satisfaction. As far as I could tell, the removal of the\r\nboots was the only washing and undressing either of them did; and then\r\nthey arranged their candles in the alcove, lighted cigars, and got\r\ninto bed. There the wretches sat up on end, smoking and talking\r\nvehemently, till sheer exhaustion came to my aid, and I fell asleep;\r\nbut the edges of the rush-bottomed chairs speedily became so sharp\r\nthat a recumbent posture ceased to be possible, and I sat dozing on\r\none chair. A little before four o'clock, the noisier man got up to\r\nlook for his boots; and as the friends continued their discussion, I\r\nalso turned out and made for the nearest stream, where I bathed in a\r\nrapid at half-past four, to wash away, if possible, the horrors of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: The true _Cimetière des Bourguignons_ is the enclosure\r\nwhere René, the victor of Nancy, buried the Burgundians who fell on the\r\nsad Sunday when Charles the Bold went down before the deaf châtelain\r\nClaude de Bagemont.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Neither of my companions, I fear, would have acted as\r\nSejanus did, when another emperor was in danger of his life in the cave\r\non the Gulf of Amyclæ.

The path to Bonneville lies for the earlier part of the way\r\nthrough pleasant scenery; and when the highest ground is reached, there\r\nis a lovely view of the Lake of Geneva, which may be enjoyed under the\r\ncool shade of a high hedge of trees, in the intervals of browsing upon\r\nwild strawberries. But after passing the curious old town of La Roche,\r\ntwo hours' walk from Thorens, the heat and dust of the dreary high road\r\nbecame insupportable; and no pedestrian who undertakes that march with\r\na heavy knapsack, under a blazing noonday sun, will arrive at Bonneville\r\nwithout infinite thankfulness that he has got through it. The road is of\r\nthe same character as that between Bonneville and Geneva, and that will\r\nsufficiently express its unpleasantness in baking times of drought.\r\n\r\nThe Glacière of the Brezon lies at no great distance from\r\nBonneville--perhaps not more than four or five miles to the SE.--but its\r\nelevation is more than 4,000 feet, and the approach is steep. The\r\nGlacière of the Valley of Reposoir, a valley which falls into the main\r\nroad between Bonneville and Chamouni at the village of Scionzier, is\r\nconsiderably higher, and a good deal of climbing is necessary in\r\nvisiting it. When I arrived at Bonneville, the whole mass of mountains\r\nin which these caves lie was enveloped in thick dark clouds, and the\r\nfaint roar of thunder reached our ears now and then, so that it seemed\r\nuseless to attempt to penetrate into the high valleys. Moreover, I was\r\ndue for an attempt upon Mont Blanc in the beginning of the next week,\r\nand an incipient bilious fever, with a painful lameness of one leg,\r\nwarned me that my powers were coming to an end, and that another day\r\nsuch as the last had been would put a total stop upon the proposed\r\nascent; and so I determined to take the fever and the leg to Geneva, and\r\nsubmit them to medical skill. This determination was strengthened by the\r\nexhortations of a Belgian, who called himself a _grand amateurdes\r\nmontagnes_, on the strength of an ascent of the Môle and the Voiron, and\r\nin this character administered Alpine advice of that delightful\r\ndescription which one meets with in the coffee-rooms at Chamouni. This\r\nBelgian was the only other guest of the Hôtel des Balances; and his\r\namiability was proof even against the inroads of some nameless species\r\nof _vin mousseux_, recommended to me by the waiter, which supplied\r\n_mal-à-propos_ wine-sauce to the various dishes from which the Belgian\r\nwas making his dinner, and did not leave his face and waistcoat free\r\nfrom stain. He had but one remark to make, however wild might be the\r\nassertions advanced from the English side of the table, '_Vous avez\r\nraison, monsieur, vous avez parfait-e-ment raison_!' It is not quite\r\nsatisfactory to hold the same sentiments, in every small particular,\r\nwith a man who clips his hair down to a quarter of an inch, and eats\r\nharicots with his fingers; but it was impossible to find any subject on\r\nwhich he could be roused to dissentience. This phenomenon was explained\r\nafterwards, when he informed me that he was a flannel-merchant\r\ntravelling with samples, and pointed out what was only too true, namely,\r\nthat the English monsieur's coat was no longer fit to be called a coat.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pictet read a paper on these glacières before the _Société\r\nHelvétique des Sciences Naturelles_ at Berne, in 1822, which is to be\r\nfound in the _Bibl. Universelle de Genève._[77] M. Pictet left Geneva in\r\nthe middle of July to visit the caves, but found himself so much knocked\r\nup by the first day's work, that he sent on his grandson to the Glacière\r\nof the Brezon, and gave up the attempt himself. The young man found it\r\nto be of small dimensions, 30 feet by 25, with a height of 10 or 12\r\nfeet. The ice on the floor was believed by the guide to be formed in\r\nsummer only, and was placed too irregularly to admit of measurement.\r\nCalcareous blocks almost choked the entrance, and an orifice in the\r\nshape of a funnel admitted the snow freely from above, and was partly\r\nfilled with snow in July. Cold currents of air proceeded from the rocks\r\nin the neighbourhood of the glacière, giving in one instance a\r\ntemperature of 38°·75, the temperature in the shade being 51°. Within\r\nthe cave, the temperature was 41°.\r\n\r\nM. Morin visited this glacière in August 1828. He describes it as a\r\nsheltered hole, in which the snow collects and is preserved.\r\n\r\nM. Thury examined it in August 1859, and gives the same account. He,\r\ntoo, found the current of air which the younger Pictet discovered, but\r\nin the cave itself the air was perfectly still.\r\n\r\nIt was clearly, then, no great loss to miss the Glacière of the Brezon;\r\nbut that on the Mont Vergy, in the Valley of Reposoir, appears to be\r\nmuch more interesting. Professor Pictet found himself sufficiently\r\nstrong after a day's rest to pass on to Scionzier, and up the Valley of\r\nReposoir, accompanied by the well-known guide Timothée, whose botanical\r\nknowledge of the district is said to be perfect. He had conducted MM.\r\nNecker and Colladon to the glacière in 1807, and believed that no\r\n_savant_ had since seen it. The rocks are all calcareous, with large\r\nblocks of erratic granite. The glacière lies about 40 minutes from the\r\nChâlet of Montarquis, whence its local name of _La grand' Cave de\r\nMontarquis_. Before reaching it, a spacious grotto presents itself, once\r\nthe abode of coiners: this grotto is cold, but affords no ice, and near\r\nit M. Morin found a narrow fissure, leading into a circular vaulted\r\nchamber 15 feet in diameter, in which stood a solitary stalagmite of ice\r\n15 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the glacière itself is elliptical in shape, 43 feet\r\nbroad at the base, and the cave increases in size as it extends farther\r\ninto the rock, the floor descending gently till a horizontal esplanade\r\nof ice is reached. This esplanade was 66 feet by 30 at the time of\r\nPictet's visit, deeper in the middle than at the sides, and mounting the\r\nrock at the farther side of the cave; there was a small stalagmite at\r\none side, but that would seem to have been the only ornamentation\r\ndisplayed. The temperature was 34°·7, a foot above the ice, and 58° in\r\nthe external air. Timothée had been in the glacière in the previous\r\nApril, and had found no ice,--nothing but a pool of water of\r\nconsiderable depth. M. Thury, in August 1859, found two sheets of ice\r\nin the lowest part of the cave: one, nearly 50 feet long, was partially\r\ncovered with water; the other, presenting an area of about 14 square\r\nyards, showed more water still. There were no stalactites and columns\r\nsuch as M. Morin had found in August 1828, nor even the low stalagmite\r\nwhich Pictet saw in 1822. The summers of 1828 and 1859 were\r\nexceptionally hot, and this fact has been held to account for the\r\nsmaller quantity of ice seen in those years. M. Thury found the cold due\r\nto evaporation to be considerably less than 1° F.,[78] and he and M.\r\nMorin both fixed the general temperature of the cave at 36°.5; they\r\nalso found a current of air entering by a fissure in the lowest part of\r\nthe cave, but it did not disturb the whole of the interior, for in one\r\npart the air was in perfect equilibrium. M. Gampert,[79] in the summer\r\nof 1823, found a strong and very cold current of air descending by this\r\nfissure, along with water which ran from it over the ice; he believed\r\nthat this was refrigerated by evaporation, in passing through the\r\nthickness of the moist rock.\r\n\r\nTwo peasants visited this cave three times in the winter season, viz. on\r\nOctober 22, November 26, and on Christmas Day; and one of them, by name\r\nChavan, drew up an account of their experiences, which was read by M.\r\nColladon before the _Société de Physique et d'Histoire Nat. de Genève_\r\nin 1824.[80] The peasants found very little ice in columns at the time\r\nof the October visit, and there were signs of commencing thaw. The thaw\r\nwas much more pronounced in November, when the ice had nearly\r\ndisappeared even from the lowest parts of the cave, and they found the\r\nair within quite warm. On Christmas Day they had great difficulty in\r\nreaching the glacière, and narrowly escaped destruction by an avalanche,\r\nwhich for a time deterred them from prosecuting the adventure: they\r\npersisted, however, and were rewarded by finding only water where in\r\nsummer all was ice, and a temperate warmth in the cave. They observed\r\nthat the roof had fissures like chimneys.\r\n\r\nThis account was so circumstantial, that the only thing left was to\r\nattempt an explanation of the phenomena reported, and such explanations\r\nhave not been wanting. But M. Thury was not quite satisfied, and he\r\ndetermined to visit the cave in the winter of 1860-1. Accordingly,\r\naccompanied by M. André Gindroz, who had already joined him in his\r\nunsuccessful attempt to reach the Glacière of the Pré de S. Livres, he\r\nleft Geneva on the 10th of January, and slept at the Chartreuse in the\r\nValley of Reposoir. As the party passed through the village of Pralong\r\ndu Reposoir, the peasants told them with one accord that they would find\r\nnothing but warmth and water in the cave; but when M. Thury asked had\r\nany of them seen it themselves, they were equally unanimous in saying\r\nno, explaining that it was not worth anyone's while to go in the winter,\r\nas there was no ice to be seen then,--a circular line of argument which\r\ndid not commend itself to the strangers.\r\n\r\nAt the very entrance of the grotto, they found beautiful stalactites of\r\nclear ice; and here they paused, till such time as they should be cool\r\nenough to enter, for the thermometer stood at 70° in the sun, and their\r\nclimb had made them hot. On penetrating to the farther recesses of the\r\ncave, where the true glacière lies, they found an abundance of\r\nstalactites, stalagmites, and columns of ice, with flooring and slopes\r\nof the same material: not a drop of water anywhere. The stalagmites were\r\nvery numerous, but none of them more than three feet high; some of the\r\nstalactites, fifteen or so in number, were six or seven feet long, and\r\nthere were many others of a smaller size. M. Thury was particularly\r\nstruck by the milky appearance of much of the ice, one column in\r\nparticular resembling porcelain more than any other substance. This is a\r\nnot unusual character of the most beautiful part of the decorations of\r\nthe more sheltered ice-caves, as for instance the lowest cave in the\r\nUpper Glacière of the Pré de S. Livres; the white appearance is not due\r\nto the presence of air, for the ice is transparent and homogeneous, and\r\nthe naked eye is unable to detect bubbles or internal fissures.\r\n\r\nThe temperatures at 1.25 P.M. and 2.12 P.M. respectively were as\r\nfollows:--In the sun, between 3 and 4 feet above the snow, 72°.1 and\r\n70°·5; in the shade, outside the cave, 36°·7 and 35°·8; at the\r\nObservatory of Geneva, in the shade, 27°·3 and 28°·2, having risen from\r\n24°·5 since noon. In the cave, 1 foot above the surface of the\r\nice-floor, the thermometer stood at 24°.8; and in a hole in the ice,\r\nsome few inches below the surface, 24°·1. In the large fissure, which has\r\nbeen already mentioned as the source of the summer currents of air, the\r\ntemperature at various points was from 29°·3 to 27°·5. The circumstances\r\nof these currents of air were now of course changed. Instead of a steady\r\ncurrent passing from the fissure into the cave, and so out by the main\r\nentrance into the open air, strong enough to incline the flame of a\r\ncandle 45°, M. Thury found a gentle current passing from the cave into\r\nthe fissure, sufficient only to incline the flame 10°, and near the\r\nentrance 8°, while in the entrance itself no current was perceptible at\r\n4 P.M.\r\n\r\nM. Thury remarks that less current was to be expected in winter than in\r\nsummer, because the upper ends of the fissures would be probably choked\r\nwith snow, and their lower ends with ice. It is evident that the current\r\nwhich passes up into the fissure in winter, is favourable to the\r\nintroduction of the colder air from without; while the opposite current\r\nin summer keeps up a supply of cold air in the cave, and so increases\r\nits powers of resisting the attempts of the heated external air to make\r\na partial entrance. Both these currents, then, favour the glacial\r\nconditions of the cave, and to some extent counterbalance the\r\ndisadvantages of its situation: viz., its aspect, towards the\r\nsouth-east; the large size of its opening to the air, and the absence of\r\nall shelter near the mouth, such as is so often provided by trees or\r\nrocks. The small depth of the cave, scarcely amounting to 18 feet below\r\nthe level of the entrance, is also a great disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe people of Pralong asked, on the return of the party, what had been\r\nfound in the _grand' cave_, and the answer reduced them to silence for a\r\nfew moments. Their prejudices, however, were invincible, and they\r\npersisted in their belief that a true glacière ought to have no ice in\r\nit in the winter. M. Thury did not enquire from what source they drew\r\ntheir ideas of a true glacière.\r\n\r\nThere is a book, in three volumes, on the 'Glacières of the Alps,' by M.\r\nBourrit, dedicated to Buffon, in which is a description of the Valley of\r\nReposoir; but no mention whatever is made of the _grand' cave_. Indeed,\r\nM. Bourrit merely meant by _glacière_, a glacial district, something\r\nmore extensive than a _glacier_, and he had evidently no knowledge of\r\nthe existence of caves containing ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: Première Série, t. xx. pp. 261, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Less than 1/2° C., he says.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: _Bibl.

My\r\nplan had been to pass from Chamouni by the Col du Géant to Courmayeur,\r\nand thence to Aosta for a visit to the canon and his glacière; but,\r\nunfortunately, the symptoms which had put an end to the expedition to\r\nthe Brezon and the Valley of Reposoir came on with renewed vigour, as a\r\nconsequence of Mont Blanc, and the projected fortnight with Peter Pernn\r\ncollapsed into a hasty flight to Geneva. It was fortunate that medical\r\nassistance was not necessary in Chamouni itself; for one of the members\r\nof our large party there was mulcted in the sum of £16, with a hint that\r\nsomething beyond that would be acceptable, for an extremely moderate\r\namount of attendance by the local French doctor.\r\n\r\nThe glacière was thus of necessity given up. It is known among the\r\npeople as _La Borna de la Glace_, and lies about 5,300 feet above the\r\nsea, on the northern slope of the hills which command the hamlet of\r\nChabaudey, commune of La Salle, in the duchy of Aosta, to the north-east\r\nof Larsey-de-là, in a place covered with firs and larches, and called\r\nPlan-agex. The entrance has an east exposure, and is very small, being a\r\ntriangle with a base of 2 feet and an altitude of 2-1/2 feet. After\r\ndescending a yard or two, this becomes larger, and divides into two main\r\nbranches, with three other fissures penetrating into the heart of the\r\nmountain, too narrow to admit of a passage. The roof is very irregular,\r\nand the stones on the floor are interspersed with ice, which appears\r\nalso in the form of icicles upon the walls; and, in the eastern branch\r\nof the cave, there is a cylindrical pillar more than 3 feet long, with\r\na diameter of rather more than a foot. The temperature at 4 P.M. on\r\nJuly 15, 1841, was as follows:--The external air, 59°; the cave, at the\r\nentrance, 37·2º; near the large cylinder, 35°·7; and in different parts\r\nof the western branch, from 33°·6 to 32°·9.\r\n\r\nM. Carrel was evidently not aware of the existence of similar caves\r\nelsewhere. He recommends, in his communication to the _Bibliothèque\r\nUniverselle_, that some scientific man should investigate the phenomena,\r\nand explain the great cold, and the fact of the formation of ice, which\r\ncommon report ascribed to the time of the Dog-days. He doubts whether\r\nrapid evaporation can be the only cause, and suggests that possibly\r\nthere may be something in the interior of the mountain to account for\r\nthis departure from the laws generally recognised in geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Nouvelle Série, t. xxxiv. p. 196.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE OF FONDEURLE, IN DAUPHINÉ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere cannot be any better place for recruiting strength than the lovely\r\nprimitive valley of _Les Plans_, two hours up the course of the Avençon\r\nfrom hot and dusty Bex. Here I rejoined my sisters, intending to spend a\r\nmonth with them before returning to England; and the neighbouring\r\nglaciers afforded good opportunities for quietly investigating the\r\nstructure of the ice which composes them, with a view to discovering, if\r\npossible, some trace of the prismatic formation so universal in the\r\nglacières. On one occasion, after carefully cutting steps and examining\r\nthe faces of cleavage for an hour and a half, I detected a small patch\r\nof ice, under the overhanging rim of a crevasse, marked distinctly with\r\nthe familiar network of lines on the surface; but I was unable to\r\ndiscover anything betokening a prismatic condition of the interior.\r\nThis was the only case in which I saw the slightest approach to the\r\nphenomena presented in ice-caves.\r\n\r\nThere remained one glacière on M. Thury's list, which I had so far not\r\nthought of visiting. It was described as lying three leagues to the\r\nnorth of Die in Dauphiné, department of the Drôme, at an altitude of\r\nmore than 5,000 feet above the sea. M. Héricart de Thury discovered\r\nthis cavern in 1805, and published an account of it in the _Annales\r\ndes Mines_[82] to which M. Thury's list gave a reference. I have since\r\nfound that this account has been translated into various scientific\r\nperiodicals, among others the Philosophical Journal of Edinburgh.[83]\r\nIt occurred to me that, by leaving Les Plans a few days earlier than I\r\nhad intended, I could take advantage of the new line connecting\r\nChambéry and Grenoble and Valence, and so visit this glacière without\r\nmaking the journey too long; and accordingly I bade farewell to Madame\r\nChérix's comfortable room, leaving my sisters in their quarters in a\r\nneighbouring châlet, and started for Geneva.\r\n\r\nThe line was advertised to open on the 15th of August; but on the 16th\r\nthe officials declared that it was not within a month and a half of\r\ncompletion, so that I was compelled to go round by Lyons. I was easily\r\nreconciled to this by the opportunity thus afforded of a visit to the\r\nancient city of Vienne, which well repays inspection. Its history is a\r\nperfect quarry of renowned names, Roman, Burgundian, and ecclesiastical.\r\nTiberius Gracchus left his mark upon the city, by bridling the\r\nRhône--_impatiens pontis_--with the earliest bridge in Gaul: and here\r\ntradition has it that the great Pompey loved magnificently one of his\r\nmany loves; while the site of the Prætorium in which Pontius Pilate is\r\nsaid to have given judgment can still be pointed out. The true Mount\r\nPilate lies between Vienne and Lyons, being one of the loftiest\r\nnorthern summits of the Cevennes, on the borders of the Lyonnaise.[84]\r\nThe Romans recognised the fitness of the neighbourhood of Vienne for the\r\ncultivation of the grape, and the first vine in Gaul was planted on the\r\nMont d'Or in the second century of the Christian era. In Burgundian\r\ntimes the city held a very prominent place, and became infamous from the\r\nfrequent shedding of royal blood; so that early historians describe it\r\nas '_tousiours fatale à ceux qui vueillent la corone des\r\nBourgougnons,'[85]_ and as '_fatale et de malencõtre aux tyrãs et\r\nmauvais princes.'[86]_ Ecclesiastically, its interest dates of course\r\nfrom a very early period, from the times of the martyrs of Gaul and the\r\nfirst Rogations. The Festival of _Les Merveilles_ long commemorated the\r\nrestoration of the bodily forms of the Lyonnese martyrs, as their\r\nscattered dust floated past the home of Blandina and Ponticus; and the\r\ndedication of the cathedral to S. Maurice keeps alive the tradition that\r\nPaschasius, bishop of Vienne, was warned by an angel to watch on the\r\nbanks of the Rhône, and so rescued the head and trunk of the\r\nsoldier-martyr, which had been cast into the river at Agaunum (S.\r\nMaurice in Valais), and had floated down--probably on sounder\r\nhydrostatical principles than the 'Floating Martyr'--through the Lake of\r\nGeneva, and so to Vienne. There are still many very interesting Roman\r\nremains in the city, as the Temple of Augusta and Livia, the Arcade of\r\nthe Forum, and the monument seen from the railway to the south of the\r\ntown. The temple is being carefully restored, and the large collection\r\nof Roman curiosities which it contained is to be removed to the church\r\nof S. Peter, now in course of restoration, which will in itself be worth\r\na visit to Vienne when the restoration is completed.[87] All the\r\nbuildings connected with the Great Council in 1311 have disappeared; and\r\nthe only relic of the council seems to be the Chalice, _or_, surmounted\r\nby the Sacred Host, _argent_, in the city arms, in remembrance of the\r\ninstitution of the Fête of the _S. Corps_. If the Emperor would but\r\nhave the town and its inhabitants deodorised, few places would be better\r\nworth visiting than Vienne.\r\n\r\nThe poste leaves Valence--the home of the White Hermitage--for Die at\r\n2.30 P.M., and professes to reach its destination in six hours; but sad\r\nexperience showed that it could be unfaithful to the extent of an hour\r\nand a half. So long as the daylight lasted, there was no dearth of\r\nobjects of interest; but when darkness came on, the monotonous roll of\r\nthe heavy diligence became aggravating in the extreme. The village of\r\nBeaumont, once the residence of an important branch of the great\r\nBeaumont family,[88] retains still its square tower and old gateway; and\r\nthe remains of a château near Montmeyran, the end of the first stage,\r\nmark the scene of the victory of Marius over the Ambrons and Teutons,\r\nlocal antiquaries believing that the name of Montmeyran is from _Mons\r\nJovis Mariani_.[89] The road lies through the bright cool green of wide\r\nplantations of the silkworm mulberry,[90] with its trim stem and rounded\r\nhead; and, in the more open parts of the valley, walnut trees of size\r\nand shape fit for an ornamental park in England relieve the monotony.\r\nThe nearer hills are covered to the top with vines, and the higher and\r\nmore distant ranges have a naked and thoroughly burned appearance,\r\nwhich suggests the idea of volcanoes to a traveller ignorant of volcanic\r\nfacts. The villages which lie at the foot of these rocky hills are built\r\nof stones taken from the beds of the streams, and are so completely of\r\none colour with the background of rock, that in many instances it is\r\ndifficult to determine whether a distant mass of grey is a village or\r\nnot. Ruined castles and towers abound; and these, and still more the\r\nwalls which surround many of the villages, point unmistakeably to times\r\nof great disturbance. The valley of the Drôme, up which the road after a\r\ntime turns, was an important locality in the religious wars; and the\r\ntown and fort of Crest especially, as its name might suggest, was a\r\nfamous stronghold, and resisted all the efforts of the Reformed party.\r\nIn yet earlier times, Simon de Montfort had frequently tried to take it,\r\nwithout success; and four years after S. Bartholomew, Lesdiguières met\r\nwith a like repulse.[91] The same story of sieges and battles might be\r\ntold of almost every village and defile of the valley. Thus, Saillans,\r\nthe third stage, was taken by the Protestant leader Mirabel, and the\r\nCatholic Gordes, in 1574, and its fortifications were razed by the Duc\r\nde Mayenne in 1581. Pontaix, again, a remarkable place, with a vaulted\r\nstreet and fortified houses overhanging the river, which here fills up\r\nthe whole valley and leaves room only for the road and the narrow\r\nvillage-town, was the scene of an obstinate and murderous fight between\r\nthe Marquis de Gordes on one side, and Lesdiguières and Dupuy-Montbrun\r\non the other, when the latter was captured, and shortly after beheaded\r\nat Grenoble.\r\n\r\nThe town of Die, _Dea Vocontiorum_, lies in a broad part of the valley.\r\nIt claims to be not _Dea Vocontiorum_ only, but also _Augusta\r\nVocontiorum_, thereby apparently defrauding the village of Aouste, near\r\nCrest, of the earliest form of its name. Die is possessed of old walls,\r\nand has four gates with towers. The great goddess from whose worship it\r\nderives its name was Cybele, notwithstanding the vehement assertions of\r\nthe official in the Poste-bureau in favour of Ceres; and three different\r\nTauroboles have been discovered here, one of which is in excellent\r\nrepair, and shows a Roman inscription surmounted by three bulls' heads.\r\nThe ceremony of the Taurobolium was new to me, and appears to have been\r\nconducted as follows:--A small cave was hollowed out, with a thin roof\r\nformed by the outer surface of the earth; and immediately above this a\r\nbull was sacrificed, so that the blood ran through the earth and dropped\r\non to a priest who was placed in full robes in the cave. The priest and\r\nthe blood-stained garments were thenceforth specially sacred, the\r\ngarments retaining their sanctity for twenty years. The inscription on\r\nthe Tauroboles which have been found in and near Die record the names\r\nof the priest, the dendrophore, the person who provided the victim, and\r\nthe emperor for whose safety the sacrifice was offered.\r\n\r\nThe people of Die have been quarrelsome from the earliest times. A\r\ncentury before the estates of the Dauphins of the Viennois were known as\r\nDauphiné,[92] the chronic contests between the Bishops and the Counts of\r\nDie had come to such a crisis, that the Dauphin Guiges André intervened,\r\nand produced a certain amount of peace; but, twenty years after, the\r\npeople killed Bishop Humbert before the gate which thence received its\r\nname of _Porte Rouge_. When the Counts of Valentinois had succeeded to\r\nthe fiefs of the Counts of Die, Gregory X. became so weary of the\r\nconstant wars, that he suppressed the bishopric, and united it to\r\nValence in 1275; but the canons, who were not suppressed, raised a\r\nmercenary army and carried on the struggle. Eventually, the canons and\r\nthe people made common cause, and joined the Pope during the Seventy\r\nYears; but when he left Avignon they came to terms with Charles VI. of\r\nFrance, and so the Diois was united to Dauphiné in 1404. Louis XIV.\r\nrestored the separate bishopric, but ruined the town by the revocation\r\nof the Edict of Nantes.\r\n\r\nThe large number of mosaics and inscriptions found in Die prove\r\nconclusively that in Roman times it was a favourite place of residence;\r\nand, so far as situation goes, it is not difficult to understand how\r\nthis should have been the case. But in the condition in which the town\r\nfound itself in the pitiless heat of August 1864, the only question for\r\nan English visitor was whether he could live through the time it was\r\nabsolutely necessary to spend there. The poste arrived, as has been\r\nsaid, an hour and a half after its time; and the sole occupant of the\r\ncoupé, who had lived on fruit and gooseberry syrup, and three penny\r\nworth of sweet cake at Crest, since a seven-o'clock breakfast, had wiled\r\naway the last hour by inventing choice bills of fare for the meditated\r\nsupper. When the lumbering vehicle stopped in the main street of Die,\r\nwhich is here something under seven yards wide, an elderly woman stepped\r\nout from the dim crowd, with an uncovered tallow candle in her hand, and\r\nasked if there was anyone for the hotel. The unwonted 'yes' seemed to\r\ncreate some surprise; but she led the way promptly to her hotel,\r\ndiplomatically meeting the rapid volley of questions respecting supper\r\nwith an unpromising silence, and the first sight of the house itself\r\ndispelled for ever all hope. An entrance was effected by the kitchen;\r\nand not only was there no fire, but there was no light of any\r\ndescription; and the one dip we brought on to the scene betrayed such\r\nsqualor on all sides, that the suggestion of a _salle-à-manger_ in\r\nconnection with such a kitchen became at once an impudent mockery. When\r\nthis farther room was reached, it proved to be even worse than the\r\nkitchen. It was shut up for the night--had been shut up apparently for a\r\nweek--and was in the possession of the cats of the town, and the flies\r\nof Egypt. Two monstrous hounds entered with us; and the cats fled\r\nhastily by a window which was slightly open at the top, spitting and\r\nhowling with fear when they missed the first spring, and came within the\r\ncognisance of their mortal foes.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done was to wash off some of the accumulated dust;\r\nbut when I asked for a bedroom for that purpose, I was conducted to a\r\ncopper in the kitchen, the water in which had been a permanency for some\r\ntime past, and was told to wash there. As for supper, there was some\r\ncold mutton; but the landlady unfortunately opened the door of the\r\ncupboard as she said so, and displayed a state of things which decided\r\nthe point against the mutton. There was nothing else in the house, and\r\nthere was no fire for cooking anything; but when they discovered that I\r\nreally would not wait till the next morning, they proposed to light a\r\nfire and warm some soup, which I declined to see in its present state.\r\nIn the way of wine, I had been recommended to make a great point of the\r\n_clairette de Die_, an excellent species of _vin mousseux_; but the\r\nchief of the women rather recommended the ordinary wine of the country,\r\nas the monsieur might not like to give a strong price. 'Was it, then, so\r\nstrong?' 'Yes, the price was undoubtedly strong.' 'How much, then?' 'A\r\nfranc a bottle.' With an eye to the future bill, the monsieur pretended\r\nto ponder awhile, as if in doubt whether his resources could stand such\r\na strain, and then, with a reckless air, decided upon the extravagance.\r\nThe clairette proved to be quite worthy of the praise which had been\r\nbestowed upon it, being a very pleasant and harmless sparkling white\r\nwine.[93]\r\n\r\nThe neighbours kept dropping into the kitchen, to see how the landlady\r\ngot on with the stranger of uncouth speech; and four of the female part\r\nof her company brought in at various times to the _salle-à-manger_ some\r\npiece of table-furniture, in order to indulge in a closer view than the\r\nopen door of the room afforded. One of them told me she had seen an\r\nEnglishman once before, a few months back; but he only had one eye, and\r\nshe seemed to think I was out of order in possessing two. At length the\r\nsoup came, and the first attempt upon it proved it to be utterly\r\nimpossible. The landlady was called in, and this fact was announced to\r\nher. 'What to do, then?--it was a good soup, a soup which the people of\r\nDie loved,--it was a soup the household eat morning and night.' All the\r\nsame, it was not a soup the present Englishman could eat, and some other\r\nsort of food must be provided, for she declined to furnish soup without\r\ngarlic and fat. She suggested an omelette; but a natural generalisation\r\nfrom all I had so far seen drew an untempting picture of the probable\r\nstate of the frying-pan, and I declined to face the idea until I was\r\nconvinced there was nothing else to be had. But, alas! notwithstanding\r\nthe righteous indignation with which the landlady met my request that\r\nthe omelette might not be all fat, the manipulation of the eggs\r\neventuated in a dish even more impracticable than the soup, flooded with\r\nunmentionable grease, and so at last the cold mutton became a necessity.\r\nTo show how hunger may work upon the feelings, I may say that, in spite\r\nof the marks of the feet of mice in the cold gravy which remained on the\r\ndish, I forced myself to cut off a wedge, and, after removing a\r\nthick layer of meat on the exposed sides, essayed to eat the heart of\r\nthe wedge. The sheep and its progenitors had been fed on garlic from all\r\ntime, and the mutton had been boiled in a decoction of that noxious\r\nherb; and this dish was in its turn rejected like the others. There was\r\nnothing for it but salad, and bread, and wine; but when the salad\r\nappeared, after a long time had been spent in the kitchen in saturating\r\nthe withered greens with oil and vitriolic vinegar, there, perched on\r\nthe top like one of those animals which sometimes spoil one's enjoyment\r\nof a strawberry-bed, was a huge onion, with numerous satellites peeping\r\nout from under the leaves. About this time, a short diversion was caused\r\nby the reappearance of one of the large hounds, whose mind was not at\r\nease as to the completeness of the previous elimination of the cats from\r\nthe _salle-à-manger;_ and the diabolical noise and scuffle which ensued\r\nupon his investigation of a dark corner, showed that his doubts had\r\nbeen well grounded. Then I discovered that there was no butter to be\r\nhad, and no milk; and when coffee was mentioned, a pan was brought out\r\nfor making that beverage, which a bullet-maker with any regard for\r\nappearances would have declined to use for melting his lead in. Finally,\r\nunder the pressure of dire hunger, I returned to the mutton, and\r\ncontrived to swallow a small piece, the taste of which did not leave me\r\nfor four or five days.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the house, where the bedrooms were, gave forth an odour\r\nwhich must be familiar to all who have burrowed in out-of-the-way places\r\nin France, approaching more nearly, perhaps, to the smell of damp cocks\r\nand hens than anything else; and the bedroom door was guarded by a huge\r\nmis-shapen dog, which evidently intended to pass the night there, if it\r\ncould not get into the room itself. The street on to which the window\r\nlooked was still populous with the inhabitants of Die; and a man with\r\nwhom I had already had a conversation respecting the glacière, who\r\nappeared to perform some of the functions of landlord of the hotel, was\r\naudibly engaged in hiring a man to accompany me on the following day.\r\nThe man whom he was attempting to persuade was evidently of an\r\nindependent turn of mind, and said that as it would be an affair of\r\nfifteen or sixteen hours at least, he would not go through so much\r\nunless his proposed comrade were a true _bonhomme_; a difficulty which\r\nthe landlord set at rest by asseverations so ready and so\r\ncircumstantial, that I determined to take everything he might tell me,\r\non any subject, with many grains of allowance.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural to expect a night of horrors; but in this I was most\r\nagreeably disappointed, and the few hours passed quietly enough till it\r\nwas time to get up. By morning light, the _salle-à-manger_ did so\r\nbristle with squalor that the kitchen was made the breakfast-room;\r\nthough as that meal only lasted two minutes, and meant nothing beyond an\r\nattempt to eat some of the bread I had been unable to eat the night\r\nbefore, one place was much the same as another. It is generally believed\r\nthat coffee is to be obtained in perfection in France; but that belief\r\nis not founded on experience of the provinces, and had long ceased to be\r\na part of my creed: nevertheless, with the idea that there is always\r\nsome redeeming-point in the darkest situation, I had hopes of the coffee\r\nof Die, in spite of the appearance of the pan; and if these hopes had\r\nbeen realised, the place might still have been tolerable. But they were\r\nnot realised. When the landlady was asked for the promised coffee, she\r\nbrought out a small earthenware pitcher containing a black liquid, and\r\nproceeded to bury its lower extremity in the hot embers of the wood\r\nfire, by which means the liquid was speedily warmed up, and also\r\nthickened with unnecessary ashes. When served--in the same dusty\r\npitcher--it had a green and mouldy taste, combined with a sour\r\nbitterness which made it utterly impossible as an article of food, and\r\nso the breakfast was confined to the rejected fragments of the loaf of\r\nthe preceding night.\r\n\r\nThe guide, or comrade as he preferred to call himself, appeared in good\r\ntime, and we started about half-past six, under a sun already\r\noppressively hot, and through heavy flaky dust, which made us feel very\r\nthankful when our route branched off from the high road. Liotir was\r\nstrong in mulberry trees and vines, for he was a keeper of silkworms,\r\nand a wine-merchant. Silkworms had not been profitable for a year or\r\ntwo, and he was almost in low spirits when he talked of them.[94] An\r\nepidemic had visited the district, and the worms ate voraciously and\r\nrefused to spin--a disease which he believed to be beyond the power of\r\nmedicine.[95] As is so often the case with the Frenchman, as compared\r\nwith the Englishman of corresponding social status, he had his\r\ninformation cut and dried, and poured it out without hesitation.\r\nSilkworms' eggs cost 15, 20, or 25 francs an ounce, according to\r\nquality; and an ounce of good seed should produce from two to three\r\nhundred francs' worth of cocoons. A man who 'makes' an ounce of seed\r\nrequires six tables, 8 feet by 4, for his cages; and as some men make\r\nthirty-five ounces, chambers of great size are necessary for the\r\naccommodation of their worms; but breeders to so large an extent as this\r\nare the princes of the trade. As we passed a farmhouse surrounded by\r\nmulberry trees and vineyards, my companion informed me that the farmer\r\nwas his partner in worms and wine both, and that the wine promised to be\r\nthe better speculation this year, for the fruit was in immense\r\nabundance. I saw afterwards that, at the time of vintage, grapes sold\r\nfor pressing at from 6 to 10 francs the hundred kilos, while 12 and 13\r\nfrancs was the price in 1863, and that in some districts of the Drôme\r\nthe owners of the presses had not barrels enough for even the first\r\npressing.\r\n\r\nThe great want of wood on the hills in whose neighbourhood we now found\r\nourselves, attracted attention in the time of Louis XIV., and that\r\nsovereign passed severe laws for the protection of the forests that\r\nstill remained. As usual, the mere severity of the laws made them fail\r\nof their object. Banishment and the galleys were the punishment for\r\nunauthorised cutting of forest trees, and death if fire were used. There\r\nis a paper in the _Journal de Physique_ of 1789,[96] on the\r\ndisappearance of the forests of Dauphiné, pointing out that when the\r\nwoods are removed from the sides of mountains, the soil soon follows,\r\nand the district becomes utterly valueless. The writer traced the\r\nmischief to the emancipation of serfs, and the consequent formation of\r\n_communes_, where each man could do that which was right in his own\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, whatever the reason, nothing can be conceived more bare\r\nthan the dun-coloured rounded hills between the town of Die and the Col\r\nde Vassieux, towards which we were making our way. The whole face of the\r\ncountry had the same parched look, and the soil seemed to be composed\r\nentirely of small stones, without any signs of moisture even in the\r\nwatercourses. The Col de Vassieux is not much more than 4,000 feet high,\r\nand forms a saddle between the Pic de S. Genix (5,450 feet) and the But\r\nde l'Aiglette (5,200 feet). A new foot-road has been made to the Col,\r\nwith many windings; and great care has been taken to plant the sides of\r\nthe hill with oak and hazel; so that already there is some appearance of\r\ncoppice, and in the course of time there will be shade by the way--a\r\nluxury for which we longed in vain. The lower ground was covered with\r\nlittle scrubs of box, and with lavender, dwarfed and dry; but near the\r\nsummit of the Col the lavender became vigorous and luxuriant, and\r\ncarpeted the hillside with a rich abundance of blue, tempting us more\r\nthan once to lie down and roll on the fragrant bed; though some of the\r\nolder roots were not sufficiently yielding to make that performance as\r\nsatisfactory as it might have been. This lavender is highly prized by\r\nthe silkworm-keepers of Die, its bushy heads being almost exclusively\r\nused for the worms to spin their cocoons in.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the top of the Col, Liotir confessed that he did not\r\nknow which way to turn, and we agreed to follow the path till we should\r\nfind some one to direct us. There was a farmhouse at no great distance,\r\nand thither we bent our steps; but the sole inhabitant could give no\r\nassistance, and, in default of information, Liotir generously proposed\r\nto treat me to a bottle of wine, over which we might discuss our further\r\nproceedings. The state of fever, however, to which the garlic and the\r\ndirt of Die had brought me, made it seem impossible to eat or drink\r\nanything; so I suggested instead that I should treat him, and that\r\nseemed to be rather what he had meant by his proposal. Nothing much came\r\nof our discussion, and we marched on hot and faint for an hour more,\r\nwhen a casual man told us that our straight line to the _Foire de\r\nFondeurle_ lay across the plain on our left hand, and up a most\r\nobjectionable-looking hill beyond, thickly covered with brushwood and\r\nshowing no signs of a path.\r\n\r\nAs we crossed the plain, there was still the same total absence of\r\nwater, and we reached the bottom of the hill in a state of mind and body\r\nwhich rebelled against the exertion of struggling with the sand and\r\nshingle and brushwood. Liotir thought it was useless to attempt it with\r\nno hope of water, and I held much the same view, only it was impossible\r\nreally to think of giving it up. When at last we had surmounted all the\r\ndifficulties which beset us, and stood on the highest point which had so\r\nfar been in sight, we found ourselves on the edge of a vast plain of\r\nparched grass, with nothing to guide us in one direction rather than\r\nanother. There was no human being in sight, no sign of water, nor any\r\nparticle of shade; nothing but grass, brown and monotonous, with white\r\ncliffs miles away at the extremity of the plain. This was evidently the\r\n_Foire de Fondeurle_, and in it somewhere lay the glacière, if only we\r\ncould make out in which direction to begin to traverse the plain. In\r\nthe earlier part of this century, a very famous fair was held on this\r\nwild and out-of-the-way table-land, to which many thousands of horses\r\nand mules and cattle of various kinds were brought from all quarters;\r\nbut the fair has fallen off so much, that the man who had turned us up\r\nthe last hill said there were only fourteen head of cattle in 1863, and\r\nvery few of those were sold. M. Héricart de Thury describes this plain\r\nas lying in the calcareous sub-Alpine range of the south-east of France.\r\nThe woods here terminate at a height of 5,147 feet above the sea, and\r\nthe _Foire de Fondeurle_ lies immediately above this point.\r\n\r\nAt last we made a bold dash across the plain, and after a time came upon\r\nsome sheep, standing in a thick row, with their heads thrust under a low\r\nbank which afforded a little shade; and at no great distance from them\r\nsat the shepherd. He was a cripple, and his clothes were something worse\r\nthan rags. He offered us a portion of the water he had in a\r\ndetestable-looking skin; but he assured us it was quite warm, and had\r\nnot been good to begin with, so we did not try it, though we were\r\nthirsty enough to have hailed a muddy pool with delight. Our new\r\nacquaintance knew nothing of the glacière, but he belonged himself to\r\nthe Chalêt of Fondeurle, and as that was the only house on the whole\r\nplain, he told us to make for it. The surface of the plain seemed to\r\nhave fallen through in many places, forming larger and smaller pits with\r\nsteep sides of limestone. These were often of the size of a large field,\r\nand, as the deeper of them required circumvention, the shepherd told us\r\nthat we must follow the line of little cairns which we should find here\r\nand there on our way, the only guide across the plain. He could not be\r\nsure himself in what direction the châlet lay; but if we kept to a\r\ncertain tortuous line, we should come to it in time.\r\n\r\nThe way proved to be so very long, that we doubted whether such a\r\nconsummation of our wishes would ever arrive: but at length, in a small\r\ndip at the farthest extremity of the plain, we saw the châlet, and, what\r\nwas much more to us, saw a little run of water, carried from the rising\r\nground by wooden pipes. It will be well for any future visitor to the\r\nchâlet to go very warily, and to intrench himself in a strong position\r\nwhen he sees half-a-dozen huge dogs like black and white bears come out\r\nto attack him. Liotir had a stout stick, and I had a formidable ice-axe;\r\nand, moreover, we fortunately secured a wall in our rear: but with all\r\nthis the dogs were nearly too much for us, and Liotir was pressing me\r\nearnestly to chop at the ringleader's head, when a man came and called\r\noff 'Dragon,' and the others then dispersed. The new-comer wished to\r\nknow our business, but, without satisfying his curiosity, we rushed to\r\nthe water-trough, and drank and used in washing an amount of water which\r\nhe evidently grudged us. Then we were able to tell him that our business\r\nwas something to eat for Liotir, and a guide to the glacière; though I\r\ntrembled when I suggested the latter, for, after all our labours, I had\r\na sort of fear that the cave would prove a myth. On this point the man\r\ncleared away all doubts at once,--we could certainly have a guide, as\r\nthe _patron_ would be sure to let one of them go with us. As to food,\r\nthere was more doubt, for the master was not yet at home, and his wife\r\nwould not be able to give us an answer without consulting him. The wife\r\nconfirmed this statement: they saw very few strangers, and did not\r\nprofess to supply food to people crossing the plain. I assured her that\r\nwe intended to pay well for anything she could let us have, but she\r\nmerely rejoined that they did not keep an auberge; however, her husband\r\nwould be home some time in the course of the afternoon--it was now about\r\nhalf-past twelve--and she could ask his opinion on the subject. But\r\nLiotir objected that he was meanwhile dying of hunger, and the monsieur\r\nof thirst which only milk or cream could assuage; he suggested that some\r\none should be sent to look for the husband, and obtain his permission\r\nfor us to be fed. To this she assented, very dubiously, and with a\r\nconstrained air, as if there were some mysterious reason why the\r\npresence of strangers was peculiarly unacceptable on that particular\r\nafternoon. At any rate, she said when pressed, she thought there could\r\nbe no harm in our entering the châlet and sitting down on a bench, where\r\nwe should be sheltered from the sun.\r\n\r\nHere accordingly we sat, more or less patiently, till the master himself\r\nappeared. He had no welcome for us; but he was willing that we should\r\neat some of his black bread, and try his wine. Liotir begged for cheese,\r\nand the wife was told she might supply cheese of two kinds, and also\r\ncream, for the monsieur evidently was _malade_ and could not swallow\r\nwine. The cream and the black bread were delicious; but still the\r\nhorrors of Die hung about me, and I could only dispose of such a small\r\namount, that Liotir waxed funny, and told me it would never do for me to\r\ndie there, as there was not earth enough to scrape a grave in on the\r\nwhole plain. Then, being a practical man, he declared he should like to\r\ncontract for my keep, and thought he could afford to do it at very small\r\ncost to me, and still leave a fair margin for himself. He thought it\r\nright to make up for my want of appetite; and so, in addition to his own\r\nshare, he took in an exemplary manner the share of wine which I should\r\nhave taken, had I been a man like himself. The master of the châlet sat\r\non the family bed, smoking silently and sullenly; and as soon as Liotir\r\nhad come to an end of his second bottle, he proposed to accompany us\r\nhimself to the cave, as he doubted whether any of his men knew the way,\r\nand he was sure they were all busy. When I came to pay his wife for what\r\nwe had consumed, I administered thanks as well as money; to which she\r\nsternly rejoined, 'Who pays need not give thanks;' and to that surly\r\nview she held, in spite of my attempts to soften her down. There was,\r\nafter all, much force in what she said, under the circumstances. They\r\nhad given us no welcome, nothing but mere food, and all they expected in\r\nreturn was a due amount of money; thanks were a mockery in their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe cavern was reached in a few minutes, when once we got away from the\r\nchâlet. Two large pits, formed apparently by the subsidence of the\r\nsurface, lay in a line about east and west, and there proved to be an\r\nunderground communication between them. From this tunnel, as it were, a\r\nlong low archway led to a broad slope of chaotic blocks of stone, down\r\nwhich we scrambled by the aid of such light as our candles afforded. The\r\nroof of this inner cave was horizontal for some distance, and then\r\nsuddenly descended in a grand wall; and in consequence of a series of\r\nsuch inverted steps, the cave never assumed any great height. The whole\r\nlength of the slope was 190 feet, and its greatest breadth about 140\r\nfeet; but the breadth varied very much. Half-way down the slope the ice\r\ncommenced, fitfully at first, and afterwards in a tolerably continuous\r\nsheet. The most careless explorer could not have failed to notice the\r\npolygonal figures stamped upon its surface. They were larger and bolder\r\nthan any I had seen before; and the prismatic nuts into which the ice\r\nbroke, when cut with the axe, were of course in proportion larger than\r\nin the previous caves. The signs of thaw, too, were unmistakeable.\r\nThough the upper surface of the earth had seemed to be utterly devoid of\r\nmoisture of any kind, large drops fell freely from the roof of the\r\ncave,[97] and the ice itself was wet. The _patron_ said there was no ice\r\nwhatever in the winter months, and that from June to September was the\r\ntime at which alone it could be found. He declined to explain how it was\r\nthat we found it so evidently in a state of general thaw in the very\r\nheight of its season. To give us some idea of the climate of the plain\r\nin winter, he informed us that the snow lay for long up to the top of\r\nthe door of his châlet.\r\n\r\nThere were in all four columns of ice in the cave, only two of which\r\nwere of any considerable size. One of these was peculiarly striking from\r\nthe very large grain which its structure displayed; it measured 19 feet\r\nacross the base, being flat towards the extremity of the cave, and round\r\ntowards the entrance. Three thermometers in various parts of the\r\nglacière gave all the same temperature, namely, a fraction under 33° F.:\r\na rough French thermometer gave 1/2° C. The extreme wall of the cavern\r\nwas completely covered by a layer of stalagmitic material, and some of\r\nthe forms the substance assumed were sufficiently striking. In contact\r\nwith the wall, though standing clear of it in parts where the wall fell\r\ninwards, stood a thick round column of the same material, shaped like\r\nthe ordinary ice-columns of the glacières, with a cavity near the base,\r\nand in all ways following the usual laws of such columns. Considering\r\nthat I had observed a layer of limestone-paste collecting on one of the\r\nice-columns of the Glacière of La Genollière, I could not help imagining\r\nthat this stalagmitic column had been originally moulded on a norm of\r\nthat description. It had a girth of 12 feet in the part where we were\r\nable to pass the tape round it. Its surface was smooth; but when we\r\ndrove a hole through this, with much damage to the _pic_ of my axe, we\r\nfound that the interior was in a crystalline form.\r\n\r\nThere was, on the whole, very little to be seen in the glacière. Had it\r\nbeen my first experience of an ice-cave, it would doubtless have seemed\r\nvery remarkable, as it did to Liotir, who, by the way, had steadily\r\ndisbelieved the possibility of natural ice in summer except in the\r\nglaciers; but as I had now seen so many, several of them much more\r\nwonderful than this, I did not care to stay longer than was absolutely\r\nnecessary for measurements and investigation. Besides, the food of\r\nDauphiné rather takes the energy and love of adventure out of an\r\nunaccustomed visitor.\r\n\r\nWithout long delay, then, we bade farewell to the _patron_, not\r\nreturning to the inhospitable châlet, and started on our way for Die,\r\neach carrying a large block of ice slung in a network of string.\r\nLiotir's purpose was to convince some mysterious female friend that he\r\nreally had seen ice in summer, within five or six hours of Die; and\r\nmine, to apply the ice to the butter which I had specially ordered the\r\nlandlady to have ready for me, that so I might be able to get through\r\nthe night, and leave Die by the diligence the first thing next morning.\r\nIt was remarkable how well the ice bore the great heat. For long the\r\nbulk of the masses we carried seemed scarcely to diminish; and if it had\r\nnot been for a course of heavy falls as we descended through the\r\nbrushwood, we should have succeeded in getting a large proportion of it\r\nsafely to Die. The precision of the prismatic structure also showed\r\nitself in a very marked manner; and when we came to a crisis of thirst,\r\nwhich happened at shorter and shorter intervals as the afternoon wore\r\non, we separated the prisms with our fingers from the edges of the ice\r\nwithout any difficulty, and made ourselves more hot and thirsty by\r\neating them.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the farmhouse at the Col de Vassieux, we reaped full\r\nbenefit from our ice. The wine, which had been hot and heavy and\r\nunpalatable in the morning, when we had tried it unmixed, became\r\ndelightfully refreshing when disguised with an abundance of water and\r\nsugar and ice; and Liotir found that contracting for my keep at a low\r\nrate would not, after all, secure him the comfortable income he had\r\nbefore calculated. After this refreshment, he became communicative, and\r\ntold me he had served seven years in the French army, three of which\r\nwere spent in working on railways. He had fought the Italian campaign,\r\nand was full of details of the battle of Solferino, on which occasion\r\nhis _bataillon_ was led on by the Emperor in person. According to his\r\naccount, four _bataillons_ were drawn up for the assault of a tower, and\r\nwhen the first advanced it was swept away to a man. The second met with\r\na like fate, and Liotir was in the third. His officers had all been\r\nkilled, and a corporal was in command. The Emperor rode up and called to\r\nthem to advance as far as he advanced. This was about a hundred yards;\r\nand then, after halting them for a moment, the Emperor cried, '_Allez,\r\nmes enfants! nous ne sommes pas tous perdus!'_ sending the fourth\r\n_bataillon_ close upon their heels. In answer to my question, Liotir\r\nsaid, slowly and solemnly, that he did not think the Emperor was under\r\nfire; a few dropping shots reached them while he was yet addressing\r\nthem, but he believed the Emperor Napoleon was not in the fire at\r\nSolferino. I took the opportunity of asking whether he was green on that\r\noccasion, as Mr. Kinglake believes that he is in times of personal\r\ndanger; but my companion utterly scouted the idea, and declared that he\r\nsaw no man through all that day so cool and capable as the Emperor. Pale\r\nhe undoubtedly was, but that was his habit. Like all other French\r\nsoldiers with whom I have had much conversation, Liotir complained of\r\nthe army arrangements in the matter of food; on all other points he was\r\nmost amiable, but when he spoke of the extortions of the _cantinière_ he\r\ncompletely lost his temper. At a _café_, the soldiers could get their\r\ncup for 15 centimes, or 20 with liqueur; whereas the _cantinière_\r\ncharged a franc, and gave them very bad coffee. Wine, too, which would\r\ncost them 60 centimes the kilo in the town, was valued at 2 francs by\r\ntheir grasping enemy. He had an idea that English soldiers are allowed\r\nto take their whole pay in money, and spend it as they will; whereas the\r\nFrench foot-soldier, according to his account, gets 25 centimes a day in\r\nmoney, and has everything found except coffee. A young trooper at\r\nBesançon was very eloquent on this subject. He represented himself as a\r\nman of small appetite and a gay spirit; he could well live on very\r\nlittle solid food, and yet he had as much deducted from his pay on that\r\naccount as anyone in the army--as much, for instance, he groaned, as a\r\ncertain stout old warrior who was then reposing on a corn-bin. If he\r\ncould have drawn all his pay in money, and lived on almost nothing for\r\nfood, he would have had abundance of sous for cards and tobacco; and\r\nwhat a career would that be!\r\n\r\nThe blocks of ice were by this time becoming rather small; and as we had\r\nnow once more reached the region of lavender, we cut a large quantity\r\nand wrapped the ice in it, and thus protected it from further thaw. For\r\nsome time before arriving at the farm where my companion's partner\r\nlived, he indulged in praises of the wine which their vineyard produced,\r\nand assurances of the safety with which it would perform a journey to\r\nEngland. He urged its excellent _bouquet_, and gave me a card of prices\r\nwhich certainly seemed marvellously reasonable. Finally, he proposed to\r\njoin me at a bottle of white _muscat_, from the farmer's _cave_, in\r\norder that I might have an opportunity of seeing how true was his\r\naccount of the wine. We seated ourselves accordingly in the farmyard,\r\nand drank a bottle of delightful wine at 65 centimes the bottle, clear\r\nand sparkling, and with a strong muscat flavour. Liotir combined with it\r\nintoxication of a different kind, and showed unmistakeable signs of his\r\ndetermination to take another member of the farmer's household into\r\npartnership,--the mysterious friend, in fact, for whose astonishment the\r\nice was intended. The white muscat, they told me, would not keep over\r\nthe year; but they had a wine at the same price which they highly\r\nrecommended, and warranted to keep for a considerable number of years.\r\nLiotir was very anxious that we should have a bottle of this, for he was\r\nconfident that I should give them an order if I once tasted it; but we\r\nhad been in at the death of so many bottles that day, that I declined to\r\ntry the _muscat rosat_. I have since had a hundred _litres_ sent over by\r\nLiotir, and find it very satisfactory. It has a rich, clear, port-wine\r\ncolour, sparkling, and with the true _frontignac_ flavour.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the wine on Liotir was peculiar. In the earlier part of\r\nthe walk, he had never seen Algeria; but after half a bottle of muscat,\r\nhe had spent six months in that country, and he enlivened the remainder\r\nof the way with many details of his experiences there. We reached Die\r\nabout half-past seven, and the arrival of real ice was hailed as a\r\nmarvel. Although I had been sent off so unhesitatingly by the landlord\r\nin the morning, it seemed that they none of them knew what a glacière\r\nmeant. They had determined that we should never reach the _Foire de\r\nFondeurle_, and that if we did, we should find nothing there to repay\r\nour toil. As I sat at an open window afterwards, Liotir's voice was to\r\nbe heard holding forth in a neighbouring café upon the wonders of the\r\nday; and among the crowd which is a normal condition of the evening\r\nstreets of Die, the words _Fondeurle_, _Vassieux_, _Anglais_, _glace_,\r\n&c., showed what the general subject of conversation was.\r\n\r\nThe landlady had obeyed orders, and was provided with butter and bread.\r\nThe tea was served in an open earthenware pitcher, with the spout at\r\nright angles with the handle. There was no cup; but the woman remarked\r\nthat if monsieur was particular about that, he could turn out the sugar\r\nand use the basin, which he did. The milk had a basin to itself; but it\r\nhad offered so large and tempting a surface to the flies of the town,\r\nthat it remained untouched. The knife and spoon were imbued with\r\nineradicable garlic, and my own trusty clasp-knife was the only weapon I\r\ncould use for all table purposes. If it had not been for the ice and the\r\nlavender, I think I should never have got away from Die. The former made\r\nit possible to eat some bread-and-butter; and of the latter I made a\r\nsort of respirator for nose and mouth, which modified the odour of cocks\r\nand hens prevailing in the house.\r\n\r\nNext morning the diligence was to start early, and, in preparation for\r\nthe six hours' drive, I ordered two eggs to be boiled for breakfast. As\r\nthe first proved to have been boiled in tepid water, I requested the\r\nlandlady to boil the second afresh, which she did in a manner that may\r\npartly account for the observed fact that the very eggs of some towns\r\ntaste of garlic. There was household soup simmering on the fire, reeking\r\nwith onion and garlic, and many other abominations; and, as if it was\r\nquite the right and usual thing to do, she slipped the unfortunate egg\r\ninto this, and left it there to be cooked. After all, garlic must be\r\ncheap as an article of food, for the whole bill amounted only to 7-1/2\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nThis was the last glacière on my list. It was quite as well that such\r\nwas the case; for the trials of Dauphiné had been too great, and I\r\nshould scarcely have been inclined to face further adventures of a like\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: T. xxx. p. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Vol. ii. p. 80.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Jean de Choul, _De variâ Quercûs Historia_, 1555.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Gollut, Mém. des Bourg. de la Franche Comté, p. 227.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Paradin de Cuyseaulx, Annales de Bourgougne, 1566, p. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Several churches in Vienne are used as foundries and\r\nworkshops.

The entrance, which faces the\r\nnorth, and is exposed to the cold winds from the snowy part of the\r\nCarpathian range, is 18 fathoms high and 9 broad; and the cave spreads\r\nout laterally, and descends to a point 50 fathoms below the entrance,\r\nwhere it is 26 fathoms in breadth, and of irregular height. Beyond this\r\nno one had at that time penetrated, on account of the unsafe footing,\r\nalthough many distant echoes were returned by the farther recesses of\r\nthe cave; indeed, to get even so far as this, much step-cutting was\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhen the external frost of winter comes on, the account proceeds, the\r\neffect in the cave is the same as if fires had been lighted there: the\r\nice melts, and swarms of flies and bats and hares take refuge in the\r\ninterior from the severity of the winter. As soon as spring arrives, the\r\nwarmth of winter disappears from the interior, water exudes from the\r\nroof and is converted into ice, while the more abundant supplies which\r\npour down on to the sandy floor are speedily frozen there. In the\r\nDog-days, the frost is so intense that a small icicle becomes in one day\r\na huge mass of ice; but a cool day promptly brings a thaw, and the cave\r\nis looked upon as a barometer, not merely feeling, but also presaging,\r\nthe changes of weather. The people of the neighbourhood, when employed\r\nin field-work, arrange their labour so that the mid-day meal may be\r\ntaken near the cave, when they either ice the water they have brought\r\nwith them, or drink the melted ice, which they consider very good for\r\nthe stomach. It had been calculated that 600 weekly carts would not be\r\nsufficient to keep the cavern free from ice. The ground above the cave\r\nis peculiarly rich in grass.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of these phenomena, Bell threw out the following\r\nsuggestions, which need no comment. The earth being of itself cold and\r\ndamp, the external heat of the atmosphere, by partially penetrating into\r\nthe ground, drives in this native cold to the inner parts of the earth,\r\nand makes the cold there more dense. On the other hand, when the\r\nexternal air is cold, it draws forth towards the surface the heat there\r\nmay be in the inner part of the earth, and thus makes caverns warm. In\r\nsupport and illustration of this view, he states that in the hotter\r\nparts of Hungary, when the people wish to cool their wine, they dig a\r\nhole 2 feet deep, and place in it the flagon of wine, and, after filling\r\nup the hole again, light a blazing fire upon the surface, which cools\r\nthe wine as if the flagon had been laid in ice. He also suggests that\r\npossibly the cold winds from the Carpathians bring with them\r\nimperceptible particles of snow, which reach the water of the cave, and\r\nconvert it into ice. Further, the rocks of the Carpathians abound in\r\nsalts, nitre, alum, &c., which may, perhaps, mingle with such snowy\r\nparticles, and produce the ordinary effect of the snow and salt in the\r\nartificial production of ice.\r\n\r\nTownson[100] visited this cave half a century later, and concluded that\r\nBell was in error with regard to the supposed winter thaw and summer\r\nfrost, although he himself received information at Kaschau which\r\ncorroborated the earlier account. He describes the approach to the\r\nvillage of Szilitze as leading by a by-road through a pleasant country\r\nof woods and hills, with much pasture-land, the cave lying a mile beyond\r\nthe village, and displaying an entrance 100 feet broad, and 20 or 30\r\nfeet high, turned towards the north. The descent of the floor of the\r\ncave is rapid, and was covered with thin ice, at the time of his visit,\r\nfor the last third of the way: from the roof at the farther end, where\r\nthe cave is not so high as at the entrance, a congeries of icicles was\r\nseen to hang; and in a corner on the right, completely sheltered from\r\nthe rays of the sun, there was a large mass of the same material. It was\r\na fine forenoon in July, and all was in a state of thaw, the icicles\r\ndropping water, and the floor of ice covered with a thin layer of water;\r\nwhile the thermometer in all parts of the cave stood at zero of\r\nRéaumur's scale. The rock is compact unstratified limestone, in which so\r\nmany of the famous caverns of the world are found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cave of Yeermalik, in Koondooz_[101]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1840, Captain Burslem, of the 13th Light Infantry, made an\r\nexpedition from Cabul to the North-west, accompanied by Lieutenant Sturt\r\nof the Bengal Engineers, who was afterwards killed in the terrible pass\r\nwhere Lady Sale, whose daughter he had married, was shot through the\r\narm.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the high and wild pass of Karakotul (10,500 feet), these\r\ntravellers reached the romantic glen of the Doaub, which lies at the\r\nfoot of the pass, and is surrounded on all sides by lofty mountains.\r\nHere they were hospitably entertained by Shah Pursund Khan, the chief of\r\nthe small territory, and their curiosity was roused by the account\r\ngiven by an old moollah of a cavern seven miles off, which the Shah\r\nstrongly advised them not to attempt to visit, for the Sheitan (the\r\ndevil), whose ordinary place of abode it was, never allowed a stranger\r\nto return from its recesses. The moollah, however, scouted this idea, on\r\nthe ground that it was much too cold for such an inhabitant; and the\r\nShah eventually agreed to accompany them to the cave with a band of his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nAs they rode through long and rich grass, following the course of a\r\ngentle stream, and tormented by swarms of forest flies, or\r\nblood-suckers, the Shah informed them that he had once endeavoured to\r\nexplore the cave, and had already penetrated to a considerable\r\ndistance, when he came upon the fresh prints of a naked foot, with an\r\nextraordinary impression by their side, which he suspected to be the\r\nfoot of Sheitan himself, and so he beat a precipitate retreat. The\r\nmoollah told them that there was a large number of skeletons in the\r\ncave, the remains of 700 men who took refuge there during the invasion\r\nof Genghis Khan, with their wives and families, and defended\r\nthemselves so stoutly, that, after trying in vain the means by which\r\nthe M'Leods were destroyed in barbarous times, and the opponents of\r\nFrench progress in Algeria in times less remote, the invader built\r\nthem in with huge natural blocks of stone, and left them to die of\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nThe entrance is half-way up a hill, and is 50 feet high, with about the\r\nsame breadth. Not far from the entrance they found a passage between two\r\njagged rocks, possibly the remains of Genghis Khan's fatal wall, so\r\nnarrow that they had some difficulty in squeezing through; and then,\r\nbefore long, came to a drop of 16 feet, down which they were lowered by\r\nropes made from the cotton turbans of the Shah and his attendants. Here\r\nthey left two men to haul them up on their return, and bade farewell to\r\nthe light of day. The narrow path led by the edge of a black abyss,\r\nsometimes over a flooring of smooth ice for a few feet, and widened\r\ngradually till they reached a damp and dripping hall, of dimensions so\r\nvast that the light of their torches did not enable them to form a\r\nconception of its size. In this hall they found hundreds of skeletons in\r\na perfectly undisturbed state, one, for instance, still holding the\r\nskeletons of two infants in its bony arms, while some of the bodies had\r\nbeen preserved, and lay shrivelled like those at the Great St. Bernard.\r\nThey were very much startled here by the discovery of the prints of a\r\nnaked human foot, and by its side the distinct mark of the pointed heel\r\nof an Affghan boot,[102] precisely what had so thoroughly frightened the\r\nShah twelve years before. The prints retained all the sharpness of\r\noutline which marks a recent impression, and led towards the farther\r\nrecesses of the cave; but the Englishmen were called away from their\r\ninvestigation by the announcement that if they did not make haste, there\r\nwould not be oil enough for lighting them to the ice-caves.\r\n\r\nProceeding through several low arches and smaller caves, they reached at\r\nlength a vast hall, in the centre of which was[103] an enormous mass of\r\nclear ice, smooth and polished as a mirror, and in the form of a\r\ngigantic beehive, with its dome-shaped top just touching the long\r\nicicles which depended from the jagged surface of the rock. A small\r\naperture led to the interior of this wonderful congelation, the walls of\r\nwhich were nearly 2 feet thick; the floor, sides, and roof were smooth\r\nand slippery, and their figures were reflected from floor to ceiling\r\nand from side to side in endless repetition. The inside of this chilly\r\nabode was divided into several compartments of every fantastic shape: in\r\nsome the glittering icicles hung like curtains from the roof; in others,\r\nthe vault was smooth as glass. Beautifully brilliant were the prismatic\r\ncolours reflected from the varied surface of the ice, when the torches\r\nflashed suddenly upon them as they passed from cave to cave. Around,\r\nabove, beneath, everything was of solid ice, and being unable to stand\r\non account of its slippery nature, they slid, or rather glided,\r\nmysteriously along the glassy surface of this hall of spells. In one of\r\nthe largest compartments the icicles had reached the floor, and gave the\r\nidea of pillars supporting the roof.\r\n\r\nThe cavern in which this marvellous mass of ice stood, branched off into\r\nnumerous galleries, one of which led the party to a sloping platform of\r\nrapidly increasing steepness, where they were startled by the\r\nreappearance of the naked foot-prints, passing down the slope. The toes\r\nwere spread out in a manner which showed that they belonged to some one\r\nwho had been in the habit of going barefoot, and Captain Burslem took a\r\ntorch and determined to trace the steps: a large stone, however, gave\r\nway under his weight; and this, sliding down at first, and then rolling\r\nand bounding on for ever, raised such a tumult of noise and echoes that\r\nthe natives with one accord cried 'Sheitan! Sheitan!' and fled\r\nprecipitately, extinguishing all the lights in their fear; so that but\r\nfor Sturt's torch the whole party must have been lost in the darkness.\r\nShah Pursund Khan at once called a retreat, vowing that it was of no use\r\nto attempt to follow the footsteps, as it was well known that the cave\r\nextended to Cabul! The guides had now lost their small allowance of\r\npluck, and wandered about despairingly for a long time before they could\r\nfind their way back to the ice-cave, and thence to the foot of the rock\r\nwhere the two men and the turban-ladders had been left. As soon as they\r\ncame in sight of this, their comrades above cried out to them that they\r\nmust make all haste, for Sheitan himself had appeared an hour before,\r\nrunning along the ledge where they now were, and finally vanishing into\r\nthe gloom beyond; an announcement which of course produced a stampede in\r\nthe terrified party of natives. Five or six rushed to the spot where the\r\nturbans hung, and only an opportune fall of stones from above prevented\r\ntheir destroying the apparatus in their blind hurry to escape. The chief\r\nclaimed the privilege of being drawn up first, and he and all his\r\nfollowers declared that nothing should ever tempt them to visit again\r\nthe Cave of Yeermalik.[104]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Surtshellir, in Iceland_.\r\n\r\nThe first account of this lava-cavern is given by Olafsen,[105] who\r\nvisited it in 1750 and 1753. Ebenezer Henderson[106] explored it in\r\n1815, and Captain Forbes gives some account of it in his recent book on\r\nIceland.[107] It is mentioned in some of the Sagas,[108] and appears to\r\nhave been a refuge for robbers in the tenth century, and Sturla\r\nSigvatson, with a large band of followers, spent some time here. The\r\nLandnama Saga derives the name Surtshellir from a huge giant called\r\nSurtur, who made his abode in the cave; but Olafsen believed that the\r\nname merely meant _black hole_, from _surtur_ or _svartur_, and was due\r\nto the darkness of the cave and the colour of the lava: in accordance\r\nwith this view, it is called _Hellerin Sortur_, or _black hole_, in some\r\nof the earlier writings. The common people are convinced that it is\r\ninhabited by ghosts; and Olafsen and his party were assured that they\r\nwould be turned back by horrible noises, or else killed outright by the\r\nspirits of the cave: at any rate, their informants declared they would\r\nno more reach the inner parts of the cavern than they had reached the\r\ntraditional green valley of Aradal, isolated in the midst of glaciers,\r\nwith its wild population of descendants of the giants, which they had\r\nendeavoured to find some time before.[109]\r\n\r\nThe cave is in the form of a tunnel a mile or more in length, with\r\ninnumerable ramifications, in the lava which has flowed from the Bald\r\nYökul. It lies on the edge of the uninhabited waste called the\r\nArnavatns-heidi, in a district described by Captain Forbes as distorted\r\nand devilish, a cast-iron sea of lava. The approach is through an open\r\nchasm, 20 to 40 feet in depth, and 50 feet broad, leading to the\r\nentrance of the cave, where the height is between 30 and 40 feet, and\r\nthe breadth rather more than 50. Henderson found a large quantity of\r\ncongealed snow at this entrance, and along pool of water resting on a\r\nfloor of ice, which turned his party back and forced them to seek\r\nanother entrance, where again they found snow piled up to a\r\nconsiderable height. Olafsen also mentions collections of snow under the\r\nvarious openings in the lava which forms the roof of the cave. The\r\nlatter explorer discovered interesting signs of the early inhabitants of\r\nthe Surtshellir, as, for instance, the common bedstead, built of stones,\r\n2-1/2 feet high, 36 feet long, and 14 feet broad, with a pathway down\r\nthe middle, forming the only passage to the inner parts of the cave. The\r\nspaces enclosed by these stones were strewn with black sand, on which\r\nrough wool was probably laid by way of mattress. This could scarcely\r\nhave been a bedstead in the time of the giants, for a total breadth of\r\n14 feet, deducting for the pathway down the middle, will not give more\r\nthan 6 feet for the layer of men on either side, unless indeed they lay\r\nparallel to the passage, and required a length of 36 feet. He also found\r\nan old wall, built with blocks of lava across one part of the cave, as\r\nif for defence, and a large circular heap of the bones of sheep and\r\noxen, presumably the remains of many years of feasting. Captain Forbes\r\nscoffs at these bones, and suggests errant wild ponies as the depositors\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nOlafsen had found in his earlier visit that the way was stopped, far\r\nin the recesses of the cave, by a lake of water, which filled the\r\ntunnel to a depth of 3 feet or more, lying on ice; but in 1753 there\r\nwas not more than a foot of water, through which they waded without\r\nmuch difficulty. The air soon became exceedingly cold and thick, and\r\nfor some hundreds of paces they saw no light of day, till at length\r\nthey reached a welcome opening in the roof. Beyond this, the air grew\r\ncolder and more thick, and the walls were found to be sheeted with ice\r\nfrom roof to floor, or covered with broad and connected icicles. The\r\nground also was a mass of ice, but an inch or two of fine brown earth\r\nlay upon it, which enabled them to keep their footing. This earth\r\nappeared to have been brought down by the water which filtered through\r\nthe roof. 'The most wonderful thing,' Olafsen remarks, 'that we\r\nnoticed here, was, that the stalactites of ice were set with regular\r\nfigures of five and seven sides, joined together, and resembling those\r\nseen on the second stomach of ruminating animals. The condensed cold\r\nof the air must have imparted these figures to the ice; they were not\r\nexternal (merely?), but in the ice itself, which otherwise was clear\r\nand transparent.'\r\n\r\nHenderson and his party appear to have had much more wading to do than\r\nOlafsen, walking in one instance through a long tract of water up to the\r\nknees. In the deeper recesses of the cave, apparently in the part where\r\nthe earlier explorers had found the reticulated ice, they found the\r\nwhole floor of the passage covered with thick ice, with so steep a dip\r\nthat they sat down and slid forward by their own weight--a most\r\nundignified proceeding for a grave gentleman on a mission from the Bible\r\nSociety. On holding their torches close to the floor, they saw down to a\r\ndepth of 7 or 8 feet, the ice being as clear as crystal. 'The roof and\r\nsides of the cave were decorated with most superb icicles, crystallised\r\nin every possible form, many of which rivalled in minuteness the finest\r\nzeolites; while from the icy floor rose pillars of the same substance,\r\nassuming all the curious and phantastic shapes imaginable, mocking the\r\nproudest specimens of art, and counterfeiting many well-known objects of\r\nanimated nature. Many of them were upwards of 4 feet high, generally\r\nsharpened at the extremity, and about 2 feet in thickness. A more\r\nbrilliant scene perhaps never presented itself to the human eye, nor was\r\nit easy for us to divest ourselves of the idea that we actually beheld\r\none of the fairy scenes depicted in Eastern fable. The light of the\r\ntorches rendered it peculiarly enchanting.'\r\n\r\nCaptain Forbes found much ice on the floor, but he did not enjoy the\r\ncold and wet, and seems to have ascended by the last opening in the\r\nroof, mentioned by Olafsen, before reaching the cavern where the more\r\nbeautiful parts of the ice-decoration were found by his predecessors.\r\nThe two engravings of the interior of the cave given in his book are\r\ncopied from the magnificent lithographs of Paul Gaimard,[110] but much\r\nof the effect has been lost in the process of copying.\r\n\r\nMr. Baring Gould mentions this cavern in his book on Iceland, and\r\nbelieves that its interest has been much overrated. He seems to have\r\nvisited the cave, but makes no allusion to the existence of ice.[111]\r\n\r\nMr. E.T. Holland visited the Surtshellir in the course of his tour in\r\nIceland, in 1861, and an account of his visit is given in the first\r\nvolume of 'Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers.'[112] After following in\r\nOlafsen's steps for some time, the party reached a cave whose floor was\r\ncomposed of very clear ice, apparently of great thickness, for they\r\ncould not see the lava beneath it. The walking on this smooth ice-floor\r\nMr. Holland describes as being delightful, the whole sloping\r\nconsiderably downwards. 'In five minutes,' he continues, 'we reached the\r\nmost beautiful fairy grotto imaginable. From the crystal floor of ice\r\nrose up group after group of transparent icy pillars, while from the\r\nglittering roof most brilliant icy pendants hung down to meet them.\r\nColumns and arches of ice were ranged along the crystalline walls ... I\r\nnever saw a more brilliant scene; and indeed it would be difficult to\r\nimagine anything more fairy-like. The pillars were many of them of great\r\nsize, tapering to a point as they rose. The largest were at least 8 feet\r\nhigh, and 6 feet in circumference at their base. The stalactites were on\r\nan equally grand scale. Through this lovely ice-grotto we walked for\r\nnearly ten minutes.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICE-CAVE IN THE SURTSHELLIR.]\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the caves, Mr. Holland states in a note, was from 8°\r\nto 10° C. (46·4° to 50° F.), that of the air outside being 53·6° F.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Gypsum Cave of Illetzkaya-Zastchita, in the Steppes of the\r\nKirghis, South of Orenburg_.\r\n\r\nThe district in which this cavern occurs is a small green oasis on the\r\nundulating steppe, lying on a vast bed of rock-salt, which extends over\r\nan area of two versts in length, and a mile in breadth, with a thickness\r\nof more than 100 feet. When the thin cover of red sand and marl is\r\nremoved, the white salt is exposed, and is found to be so free from all\r\nstain, or admixture of other material, excepting sometimes minute\r\nfilaments of gypsum, that it is pounded at once for use, without any\r\ncleansing or recrystallising process.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of Illetzkaya-Zastchita there are two or\r\nthree gypseous hillocks, and a cavern in one of these is used by the\r\ninhabitants as a cellar, having been artificially enlarged for that\r\npurpose. Sir Roderick Murchison and his colleagues visited this cavern\r\non a hot day in August, with the thermometer at 90° in the shade, in the\r\ncourse of their travels under the patronage of the late Emperor of\r\nRussia.[113] They found the hillock to be an irregular cone 150 feet in\r\nheight; the entrance was by a frail door, on a level with the village\r\nstreet, and fully exposed to the rays of the sun; and yet, when the door\r\nwas opened, so piercing a current of cold air poured forth, that they\r\nwere glad to beat a retreat for a while; and on eventually exploring\r\nfarther, they found the quass and provisions, stored in the cave,\r\nhalf-frozen within three or four paces of the door. The chasm soon\r\nopened out into a natural vault from 12 to 15 feet high, 10 or 12 paces\r\nlong, and 7 or 8 in width, which seemed to have numerous small\r\nramifications into the impending mound of gypsum and marl. The roof of\r\nthis inner cavern was hung with undripping solid icicles, and the floor\r\nwas a conglomerate of ice and frozen earth. They were assured that the\r\ncold is always greatest within when the external air is hottest and\r\ndriest, and that the ice gradually disappears as winter approaches, and\r\nvanishes when the snow comes. The peasants were unanimous in these\r\nstatements, and asserted that they could sleep in the cave without\r\nsheepskins in the depth of winter.\r\n\r\nSir Roderick Murchison and his friends were at first inclined to explain\r\nthese phenomena by supposing that the chief fissure communicated with\r\nsome surface of rock-salt, 'the saliferous vapours of which might be so\r\nrapidly evaporated or changed in escaping to an intensely hot and dry\r\natmosphere as to produce ice and snow.' But Sir John Herschel, to whom\r\nthey applied for assistance, rejected the evaporation theory, and\r\nsuggested that the external summer wave of heat might possibly only\r\nreach the cave at Christmas, being delayed six months in its passage\r\nthrough the rock; the cold of winter, in the same manner, arriving at\r\nmidsummer. To this the explorers objected, that the mound contained many\r\ncaves, but' only in this particular fissure was any ice found. Dr.\r\nRobinson, astronomer at Armagh, endeavoured to explain the matter by\r\nreferring to De Saussure's explanation of the phenomena of _cold\r\ncaves_ in Italy and elsewhere; but this, too, was considered\r\nunsatisfactory. At length, Professor Wheatstone referred them to the\r\nmemoir by Professor Pictet, in the _Bibliothèque Universelle_ of Geneva,\r\nwhere that _savant_ improves upon De Saussure's theory, and applies it\r\nin its new form to the case of caves containing permanent ice, in tracts\r\nwhose mean cold is above the freezing point. This they seem to have\r\naccepted, adding that the climatological circumstances of Orenburg--a\r\nwet spring, caused by the melting of the abundant snows, followed by a\r\nsummer of intense and dry Asiatic heat--must be particularly favourable\r\nfor the working out of the theory, and must also act powerfully in\r\nproducing the refrigerating effects of evaporation.[114]\r\n\r\nThe traveller Pallas visited Illetzkaya in July 1769, and describes\r\nthis gypseous hillock.[115] In his time the entrance by the side of\r\nthe hill was unknown, as also was the existence of ice in the cavern.\r\nHe saw at the top of the Kraoul-naï-Gora, or Watch-mountain, as it was\r\ncalled, a fissure which had once formed a large cavern, into which the\r\nKirghis were in the habit of throwing furs and other materials as\r\nreligious offerings. Although the cave had since fallen in, they still\r\nkept up a part of the ceremony, marching solemnly round the base of\r\nthe hill once a year, and bathing in the neighbouring water. In\r\nearlier times, a man had descended through the fissure by means of\r\ncords, and found the cold within insupportable, having very probably\r\nreached the present ice-cave.\r\n\r\nPallas describes many caves in various parts of Russia, but never\r\nseems to hint at the existence of ice in them, though he specially\r\nmentions their extreme cold. Some of these occurred in gypsum, and\r\nsome in limestone; and the gypseous caves showed universally a very\r\nlow temperature, though still far above the freezing-point.[116] Thus\r\nin the dark cavern of Barnoukova,[117] on the Piana, in a rock of\r\ngypsum, while the thermometer in the shade stood at 75°.2, the\r\ntemperatures at various points in the cave were,--at the entrance\r\n59°.36, 25 feet from the entrance 46°.4, and in the coldest part\r\n42°.8. This cold he describes as insupportable. The temperature of the\r\nwater which had accumulated in the coldest parts of the cave was\r\n48°.8, considerably higher than the surrounding atmosphere; from which\r\nPallas concluded that the cold of gypsum-caves is due to the acid\r\nvapours which are generally observed in grottoes of this description.\r\nIn May 1770, he found snow on the sloping entrance to the cavern of\r\nLoeklé, in the neighbourhood of the Oufa; but the air of the interior\r\nwas not colder than was to be expected in a deep cave.\r\n\r\nSir R. Murchison wrote to Russia for further information with respect to\r\nthis cave in January 1865, and again in the beginning of April,\r\naddressing his second enquiry to the Secretary of the Imperial Academy.\r\nIn reply, the Secretary says that he is not aware that any thermometric\r\nobservations have been made in the cavern. He encloses a short statement\r\nby M. Helmersen, one of the members of the Academy, to the following\r\neffect:--About 50 versts SE. of Miask, in the chain of the Ural, is a\r\ncopper mine, called Kirobinskoy, which was abandoned more than fifty\r\nyears ago. On the 7th July, 1826, M. Helmersen found a thick wainscoting\r\nof ice on the sides and roof and floor of the horizontal gallery, within\r\n10 feet of the entrance. He was assured that this ice never melts, and\r\nthat its thickness is greater in summer than in winter. M. Helmersen\r\nadds, that to the best of his belief no one has investigated the cavern\r\nof Illetzkaya Zastchita since Sir R. Murchison's visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ice-Cavern of the Peak of Teneriffe_.[118]\r\n\r\nThis cave is at a height of 11,040 feet above the sea, and is therefore\r\nnot far below the snow-line of the latitudes of the Canary Isles. The\r\nentrance is by a hole 3 or 4 feet square, in the roof of the cave, which\r\nmay be about 20 feet from the floor. The peasants who convey snow and\r\nice from the cave to the lower regions, enter by means of knotted ropes;\r\nbut Professor Smyth had caused his ship's carpenter to prepare a stout\r\nladder, by which photographic instruments and a lady were taken down.\r\n\r\nOn alighting on a heap of stones at the bottom, the party found\r\nthemselves surrounded by a sloping wall of snow, 3 feet high, and 7 or 8\r\nfeet broad, the basin in which they stood being formed in the snow by\r\nthe vertical rays of the sun, and by the dropping of water from the\r\nedges of the hole[119]. Beyond this ring-fence, large surfaces of water\r\nstretched away into the farther recesses of the cave, resting on a layer\r\nof ice, which appeared to be generally about 2 feet thick. At one of the\r\ndeeper ends of the cave, water dropped continually from the crevices of\r\nthe roof; a fact which Professor Smyth attributed to the slow advance of\r\nthe summer wave of heat through the superincumbent rock, which was only\r\nnow reaching the inner recesses of the loose lava, and liquefying the\r\nresults of the past winter. There would seem to be immense infiltration\r\nof meteoric water on the Peak; for, notwithstanding the great depth of\r\nrain which falls annually in a liquid or congealed form, the sides of\r\nthe mountain are not scored with the lines of water-torrents.\r\n\r\nThough occurring in lava, this cavern is quite different from\r\nlava-tunnels, such as the Surtshellir, which are recognised formations,\r\nproduced by the cooling of the terminal surface-crust of the stream of\r\nlava, and the subsequent bursting forth of the molten stream within.\r\nThis, on the contrary, proved to be a smooth dome-shaped cave, running\r\noff into three contracting lobes or tunnels which might be respectively\r\n70, 50, and 40 feet long, and were all filled to a certain depth with\r\nwater: in the smoothness of the interior surfaces, Professor Smyth\r\nbelieved that he detected the action of highly elastic gases on a\r\nplastic material.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer takes exception to the term 'underground glacier'[120]\r\nwhich had been applied to this cavern. He represents that the mountain\r\nis abundantly covered each winter with snow, in the neighbourhood of the\r\nice-cave, which is nearly within the snow-line, and the stores of snow\r\nthus accumulated in the cave have no great difficulty in resisting the\r\neffects of summer heat, since all radiation is cut off by the roof of\r\nrocks. The importance of this protection may be understood from the fact\r\nthat in the middle of July the thermometer at this altitude gave 130° in\r\nthe sun, but fell to 47° when relieved from the heat due to radiation.\r\nAt the time of this observation, there were still patches of snow lying\r\non the mountain-side, exposed to the full power of direct radiation;\r\nand, therefore, there is not anything very surprising in the permanence\r\nof snow under such favourable circumstances as are developed in the\r\ncave. Mr. Airy, a few summers ago, found the rooms of the Casa Inglese,\r\non Mount Etna, half filled with snow, which had drifted in by an open\r\ndoor, and had been preserved from solar radiation by the thick\r\nroof.[121]\r\n\r\nHumboldt remarks, that the mean temperature of the region in which the\r\nCueva del Hielo (ice-cave) occurs, is not below 3° C. (37.4° F.), but so\r\nmuch snow and ice are stored up in the winter that the utmost efforts of\r\nthe summer heat cannot melt it all. He adds, that the existence of\r\npermanent snow in holes or caves must depend more upon the amount of\r\nwinter snow, and the freedom from hot winds, than on the absolute\r\nelevation of the locality.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Teneriffe are men of faith. They have large belief in the\r\nexistence and intercommunication of numerous vast caverns in the Peak,\r\none of which, on the north coast, is said to communicate with the\r\nice-cavern, notwithstanding 8 miles of horizontal distance, and 11,000\r\nfeet of vertical depth. The truth of this particular article of their\r\ncreed has been recently tested by several worthy and reverend hidalgos,\r\nwho drove a dog into the entrance of the cavern on the sea-coast, in the\r\nbelief that he would eventually come to light again in the ice-cave: he\r\nwas accordingly found lying there some days after, greatly fatigued and\r\nemaciated, having in the interval accomplished the 11,000 feet of\r\nsubterranean climbing.

It is\r\ndescribed by Sartori,[123] as lying in a much-fissured region, reached\r\nafter four hours of steep ascent from the neighbouring village, through\r\na forest of fir. Some of the fissures contain water and some snow,\r\nwhile others are apparently unfathomable. From one of the largest of\r\nthese, a strong and cold current blows in summer, and in this fissure is\r\nthe ice-hole. Sartori found _crimpons_ necessary for descending the\r\nfrozen snow which led from the entrance to the floor of the cave, where\r\nhe discovered pillars and capitals and pyramids of ice of every possible\r\nshape and variety, as if the cave had contained the ruins of a Gothic\r\nchurch, or a fairy palace. At the farther end, after passing large\r\ncascades of ice, his party reached a dark grey hole, which lighted up\r\ninto blue and green under the influence of the torches; they could not\r\ndiscover the termination of this hole, and the stones which they rolled\r\ndown into it seemed to go on for ever. The greatest height of the cave\r\nis about 36 feet, and its length 192 feet, with a maximum breadth of 126\r\nfeet. Towards the end of autumn, the temperature of the ice-hole rises\r\nso much, that the glacial decorations disappear, and various wild\r\nanimals are driven by the cold of winter to take shelter in the\r\ncomparative warmth of the cave. The elevation of the district in which\r\nthis ice-hole occurs is about 1,800 German feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nIn Upper Styria, where the Frauenmauer overlooks the basin in which the\r\nmining town of Eisenerz is situated, an ice-cave has been explored, and\r\na description of it has been given by certain members of the Austrian\r\nAlpine Club.[124] The Brandstein is spoken of as one of the peaks in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood; and as the cave previously described is stated\r\nby Sartori to be on the Brandstein, that district would seem to be rich\r\nin glacières. The cavern is most easily explored from Eisenerz, and on\r\nthat side the entrance is 4,539 Vienna feet above the sea. Its other\r\noutlet, in the Tragöss valley, is 300 feet higher. The total length of\r\nthe cave is 2,040 Vienna feet. After passing the entrance, which is an\r\narchway from 12 to 18 feet high, the main course of the cave is soon\r\nleft, and a branch is followed which leads to the _Eis-kammer_. This\r\nice-chamber consists of a grotto from 30 to 40 fathoms long, decked with\r\nice-crystals, pillars of ice, and cascades of the same material, the\r\nfloor being composed of ice as smooth as glass. In the summer,\r\npleasure-parties assemble in the cave and amuse themselves with the game\r\nof _Eisschiessen_, so popular in Upper Styria as a winter diversion. The\r\nhotter the summer, the more ice is found in the Eiskammer, and the\r\ngeneral belief is that it all disappears in winter.\r\n\r\nThe cave proper, which assumes stupendous dimensions in its long course,\r\nshows no ice. It seems to be formed in the Muschelkalk of the Trias\r\nformation, and so far no limestone stalactites have been discovered. It\r\nhas not, however, as yet been fully explored. The editor of the\r\nproceedings of the Austrian Alpine Club gives a reference to Scheiner,\r\n'_Ausflug nach der Höhle der Frauenmauer,' (Steiermarkische Zeitschrift,\r\nneue Folge_, i. 2, 1834, p. 3.)\r\n\r\nAt Latzenberg, near Weissenstein in Carniola, there is another ice-cave,\r\ndescribed by Rosenmüller.[125] It is entered by a long dark passage in\r\nwhich are pillars of ice arranged like the pipes of an organ, varying\r\nfrom the thickness of a man's body to the size of a straw. All these are\r\nsaid to melt in winter. Farther on are two other passages, one of which\r\npasses upwards over _Stufe_, and is coated in summer with ice; the other\r\nhas not been explored.\r\n\r\nNear Glaneck in the Untersberg, not far from Salzburg, is a cave called\r\nthe Kolowrathöhle, of which a description is given by Gümbel in his\r\ngreat geological work on the Bavarian Alps.[126] It is a spacious\r\ncavern, opening in a steep wall of rock above the _Rositenschlucht_\r\nbetween the Platten and _Dachstein-kalk._[127] An ice-current rushes\r\nfrom within, and ice is found on the threshold, becoming more prevalent\r\nin the farther recesses of the cave. The lower parts are tolerably\r\nroomy, and masses of ice of various shapes are found piled one upon\r\nanother, lighting up with magical effect when torches are brought to\r\nbear upon them. Gümbel believes that the cold currents which stream into\r\nthe cave from the numerous fissures in its walls are the cause of the\r\nice; and though this is the only known ice-cave far and near, he\r\nimagines that the icy-currents which are frequently met with in that\r\ndistrict, and in the _Hochgebirge_, would be found to proceed in reality\r\nfrom like caves, if the fissures from which they blow could be\r\npenetrated.\r\n\r\nBehrens[128] describes two ice-caves near Questenberg, in the county of\r\nStollberg, on the Harz mountains. They both occur in limestone, and are\r\nknown as the Great and Little Ice-holes. The one is close to the village\r\nof Questenberg, and consists of a chasm several fathoms deep, so cold\r\nthat in summer the water trickling down its edges is frozen into long\r\nicicles. The opening is large and faces due south, and yet the hotter\r\nthe day the more ice is found; whereas in winter a warm steam comes out,\r\nas if from a stove. The other cave is farther into the mountain; it is\r\nspacious and light, and very cold in summer.\r\n\r\nIn Gehler's _Physik. Wörterbuch_ (Art Höhle), a small hole is mentioned\r\nnear Dôle, which is said to be remarkable for the large and\r\ncuriously-shaped icicles found there; but no sufficient account of it\r\nseems to have been given.\r\n\r\nAn ice-hole is also spoken of in the same article, which occurs on the\r\neast side of the town of Vesoul.[129] The hole is described as being\r\nsmall, with a little rivulet of water: this water, and also that which\r\ntrickles down the walls of the cave, is converted into ice, and so much\r\nis formed on a cold day that it requires eight warm days to melt it.\r\nGollut, in his description of the _fré-puits_ of Vesoul,[130] observes\r\nthat the remarkable pit known by that name was so cold, that in his time\r\nit had never been fully explored. Gehler's expression, however, 'a small\r\nhole,' cannot possibly apply to the _fré-puits_; so that these would\r\nseem to be two different examples of cold caves near Vesoul.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting account in Poggendorff's Annalen[131] of a visit\r\nmade by Professor A. Pleischl to a mountain in the circle of Leitmeritz,\r\nwhere ice is found in summer under very curious circumstances. The\r\nmountain is called Pleschiwetz, and lies above Kameik, in Bohemia, not\r\nfar from the town of Leitmeritz. On the 24th of June in each year, large\r\nnumbers of pilgrims assemble at the romantic chapel of S. John the\r\nBaptist in the Wilderness; and it is a part of their occupation to\r\nsearch for ice under the basaltic rocks, and carry it home wrapped in\r\nmoss, as a proof that they have really made the pilgrimage. Professor\r\nPleischl visited this district at the end of May 1834. The weather was\r\nhot for the season, as had been the case in April also, and there had\r\nbeen very little snow in the winter. A path leads from the chapel of S.\r\nJohn through the woods which deck the Pleschiwetz, and then over a small\r\nplain to the foot of the basaltic rocks. Here the mountain slopes away\r\nvery steeply to the south, and the slope is thickly strewn with basaltic\r\n_débris_. From east to west this slope measures about 40 fathoms, and\r\nits length is about 70 fathoms. It is surrounded on both sides and at\r\nthe foot by trees and shrubs. The sun burned so directly on to the\r\n_débris_, that the basaltic blocks were in some cases too hot to be\r\ntouched by the naked hand.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pleischl spent three hours of the early afternoon on this\r\nspot. The upper surface of the basaltic blocks had a temperature of at\r\nleast 122° F. The presence of an icy current was detected by inserting\r\nthe hand into the lower crevices; and on removing the loose stones to a\r\ndepth of 1-1/2 or 2 feet, ice was found in considerable quantities. On\r\nthe 27th of August, he proceeded to make a further investigation of this\r\nphenomenon; but he found the temperature of the blocks only 106° F., and\r\nin the crevices, at a depth of 2 or 3 feet, the lowest temperature\r\nreached was 38°·75 F. The external temperature in the shade was at the\r\nsame time 83° F.\r\n\r\nA third visit, in January 1835, gave no results; but on January 21,\r\n1838, the Professor succeeded in determining some very remarkable\r\nfacts. A depression in the sloping plain is called, _par excellence_,\r\nthe ice-hole; and this is surrounded by firs and birches, which grow\r\nwithin three or four fathoms of the edge of the hole, so that the\r\nrays of the sun do not reach the hole in winter. Fresh snow lay on\r\nthese trees; and there was nowhere any sign of melted snow, or of the\r\nformation of icicles. The basaltic _débris_, in which ice had been\r\nfound in the summer, covers here a space of 5 fathoms long by 3 or 4\r\nbroad, immediately at the foot of a steep basaltic precipice. At\r\neleven in the morning the temperature was 14° F. in the shade; and\r\nsnow lay all round the ice-hole, to a thickness of 1-1/2 or 2 feet.\r\nThe snow which covered the _débris_ was pierced by holes, which could\r\nnot have been caused by the sun, for its rays did not penetrate the\r\ntrees; and, indeed, no sun had been visible for some days. These holes\r\nwere generally turned towards the north, and were like chimneys. On\r\ninvestigation, it was found that icicles hung down into them, showing,\r\nof course, past or present thaw, and within the cavities no ice was\r\nfound. The thermometer gave here from 27°·5 F. to 25°·15 F.; but in\r\nthe crevices, into which the thermometer could not be pushed, the hand\r\ndiscovered a warm air. The moss drawn from these crevices was found to\r\nbe steeped in unfrozen water, and it froze promptly when brought into\r\nthe outer air.\r\n\r\nThe party afterwards climbed up the precipitous basalt, and reached, at\r\n3 P.M., a level covered with large blocks of the same material, where\r\nthe thermometer was slightly under 12° F. in the shade. The blocks were\r\nfor the most part stripped of snow, and in some cases thin shields of\r\nice were observed standing out two or three inches from them, forming\r\nhollow chambers, in which an agreeable warmth was found. These shields\r\nwere invariably on the south side of the stones, the north side being\r\nfree from ice and snow alike. In some places vapours were seen to rise.\r\nThe thermometer gave 41° F. at a depth of six inches among the stones,\r\nthough the external temperature, as has been said, was 12° F. For eight\r\ndays previously, the thermometer had been always far below the freezing\r\npoint, and on the 17th (four days before) had been 13° below zero (F.).\r\nOn the 19th and 20th heavy snow had fallen. All these facts seem to show\r\nthat the warmth which had caused the chimneys in the snow over the\r\nice-holes, and the heated vapours on the higher parts of the mountains,\r\nproceeded from within, and not from without.\r\n\r\nThe people of the district assured Professor Pleischl that the hotter\r\nthe summer, the more ice is formed; and that it disappears when the\r\nnights become long and the days short. Dr. Weiss, for six years head of\r\nthe Gymnasium of Leitmeritz, stated that when one of the holes was\r\nemptied of ice in the summer, it filled again in a few days. The\r\nexplanation given by the Professor of this phenomenon is, that the\r\nblocks of basalt, that being an excellent conductor of heat, pass so\r\nmuch warmth through to their under surfaces--which form the roof of\r\nsmall chambers filled with a spongy mass of decaying leaves--that the\r\nrapid evaporation thereby caused produces the cold air and the ice. He\r\nomits to explain why there should be anything exceptional in the winter\r\nphenomenon of the crevices among the stones.\r\n\r\nThere are two other places in Bohemia where ice is found in summer. One\r\nis on the Steinberg, in the county of Konaged;[132] it is a small basin,\r\nsurrounded by trees, where, in the middle of summer, lumps of ice are\r\nfound under basaltic _débris_. This ice is only formed, according to\r\nSommer, in the hottest part of the year. The other is on the\r\nZinkenstein, one of the highest points of the Vierzehnberg, in the\r\ncircle of Leitmeritz. It is described by Sommer[133] as a cleft, five\r\nfathoms deep, in the basaltic rock, where ice is found in the hottest\r\nseasons. Professor Pleischl put this assertion to the test by visiting\r\nthe spot in the end of August, when he found no signs of ice.\r\n\r\nAnother writer in Poggendorff[134] describes a somewhat similar\r\nappearance on the Saalberg. Here ice is found on the surface from June\r\nto the middle of August; and that, too, with a west exposure and in\r\nmoderate shade. In July, the ice was so abundant that it could be seen\r\nfrom some distance: it was half a foot thick, and yielded neither to sun\r\nnor rain. In the middle of August there was no ice on the surface; but\r\nwhen the loose _débris_ was removed, the most beautiful ice appeared,\r\nand at a little depth all was frozen as hard as if it had been the depth\r\nof winter.[135] The people who work in the neighbourhood declare that\r\nthe place remains open, and free from ice or snow, in the greatest cold,\r\nand that no ice begins to form till the month of June. When the writer\r\nof the account in Poggendorff visited the ice-hole, the peasants were in\r\nthe habit of carrying large masses of ice down to their houses, through\r\na temperature of 81° F.\r\n\r\nReich[136] gives a detailed and valuable account of the prevalence of\r\nsubterranean ice on the Sauberg, a hill which forms one side of a ravine\r\nnear Ehrenfriedersdorf. The surface is about 2,000 feet above the sea,\r\nand its mean temperature, as determined by many careful observations,\r\nabout 45° F. There are several tin-mines in this district, and the\r\nextended observations made by the authorities establish the curious fact\r\nthat the mean temperature is considerably lower beneath than at the\r\nsurface. For instance, in the S. Christoph pit, it is found that the\r\nmean temperature, at 15 fathoms below the surface, is only slightly\r\nabove 42° F.; while at the Morgenröther cross-cut the same mean\r\ntemperature is found at a depth of 46 fathoms. The annual change of\r\ntemperature is very small in these mines, and the maximum and minimum\r\nare reached very late; so that, if a point could be found with a mean\r\ntemperature of 32° F., ice would increase there up to June or even July,\r\nand then diminish until December or January; in which case the\r\nphenomenon so often said to be observed in connection with subterranean\r\nice--the melting in winter and forming in summer--would really be\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThe ice on the Sauberg is frequently found to commence at a depth of 3\r\nor 4 fathoms, and in the years 1811 and 1813 it extended to 24 fathoms\r\nbelow the surface: this depth, however, was exceptionally great, and as\r\na rule the limit is reached at about 14 fathoms.[137] The ice is usually\r\nnot very firm, and can be broken by stout blows with a stick; but\r\nbetween the years 1790 and 1800, when it was found at a depth of from 3\r\nto 9 fathoms, it was so hard that blasting became necessary, and at that\r\ntime the miners were with difficulty protected from the effects of the\r\nsevere cold. The greatest quantity of ice is found in the interstices of\r\nthe rubbish-beds of old workings, and here it assumes a crystalline\r\nform, the rocks being covered with a 'fibrous' structure, arranged\r\nperpendicularly to their surface.\r\n\r\nReich reports the universal presence of cold currents of air in these\r\nshafts and mines, and, in consequence, takes the opportunity of\r\ncontradicting a statement in Horner's _Physik. Wörterbuch,_[138] that\r\nthe absence of all current of air is essential to the formation of\r\nsubterranean ice. He quotes the case of the cheese-caves of Roquefort as\r\na further confirmation of his own observations with regard to the\r\nconnection between ice in caves and cold currents of air; but of the\r\nmany accounts which I have met with of the curious caves referred to,\r\nboth in books and from the lips of those who have visited them, not one\r\nhas made any mention of ice.[139] He states, too, that when the strength\r\nof the current is diminished, its temperature is increased; a fact which\r\nall observations of the cold currents in caves, especially those made\r\nwith so much care by M. Saussure, abundantly establish.\r\n\r\nIn the way of explanation, Reich mentions the possibility of rocks of\r\npeculiar formation possessing actually a low degree of temperature;[140]\r\nbut he rejects this suggestion, preferring to believe that in some cases\r\nthe cold resulting from evaporation is the cause of ice, and in others\r\nthe greater specific gravity of cold as compared with warmer air.\r\n\r\nIn the _Bulletin des Sciences Naturelles_,[141] it is stated that a\r\nlarge quantity of ice is found in one of the recesses of the grotto of\r\nAntiparos--a fact which I have not seen mentioned elsewhere. After\r\npenetrating a long way through difficult fissures, a square chamber is\r\nat length reached, measuring 300 feet in length and breadth, with a\r\nheight of about 80 feet. The walls and roof and floor are beautifully\r\ndecorated with ice, and reflect all the colours of the rainbow. There\r\nare groups of pyramidal and round columns, and in some parts of the cave\r\nscreens or curtains of ice 10 or 12 feet broad hang down to the floor.\r\n\r\nIn a later volume of the same periodical,[142] there is a description of\r\na hill in Virginia where ice is found in summer. This hill lies near the\r\nroad between Winchester and Romney, on the North River, latitude 39º N.\r\nOne side of the hill is entirely composed of loose stones from ten to\r\ntwenty pounds in weight, and under these the ice is found, although\r\ntheir upper surface is exposed to the full sun from 9 or 10 A.M. till\r\nsunset. In all seasons there is an abundance of ice. A writer in the\r\n'London and Paris Observer'[143] visited the spot on the 4th of July,\r\nafter a time of stifling heat, and in ten minutes he found more ice than\r\nthe whole party could have carried away. He did not explore any farther\r\nthan the foot of the hill; but the neighbours, who used the ice\r\nregularly in summer, assured him that it was to be found high up also.\r\nA constant and strong current issued from the crevices, stronger and\r\ninfinitely colder than the current in the famous 'blowing cave' of\r\nVirginia. A man had built a store-room for meat within the influence of\r\none of these currents, and hard dry icicles were seen hanging from the\r\nwooden supports inside: the flies, too, which had been attracted by the\r\nmeat, were found frozen on to the stones. This is not the only district\r\nwhere ice is found within temperate latitudes in North America. In\r\nProfessor Silliman's 'American Journal of Science,'[144] in a sketch of\r\nthe geology of the township of Salisbury, Con. (latitude 43° N.),\r\n'natural ice-houses' are mentioned. These consist of chasms of\r\nconsiderable extent in the mica-state, where ice and snow remain during\r\nthe greater part of the year. The principal of these chasms lies in the\r\neast part of the town, and is several hundred feet long, sixty feet\r\ndeep, and about forty wide. The slate is of a very compact kind; and the\r\nwalls are perpendicular, and correspond with much exactness. At the\r\nbottom is a cold spring, and a cave of considerable extent, in which it\r\nis probable that the ice lies--for the writer does not specify the\r\nposition in which it is found. The chasm is a favourite retreat in\r\nsummer, and is called the Wolf-hollow, from its having formerly been a\r\nfamous haunt for wolves.\r\n\r\nSimilar receptacles for summer-ice are found in several places in North\r\nAmerica. In the forty-ninth volume of the _Sitzungsberichte der Kaiserl.\r\nAkademie in Wien_ (1te. Abth.), a list of references to various\r\nice-holes is appended to a paper by Dr. Boué on the geology of Servia.\r\nMany of the passages referred to have nothing to do with ice-caves, as,\r\nfor instance, the sections of De Saussure's book describing his\r\nobservations of 'cold caves', or the account of the mass of ice and\r\nsnow from which the river Jumna springs, for which Dr. Boué refers to\r\nthe 'Philosophical Magazine' for November 1823, meaning, in fact, the\r\n'London Magazine'. The 'Description des Glacières' of M. Bourrit is also\r\ngiven as a part of the literature on ice-caves; whereas (see the account\r\nof the Glacière of Montarquis, in the Valley of Reposoir) by 'glacière'\r\nM. Bourrit meant only a locality where ice is to be found, or a glacier\r\ndistrict. Dr. Boué, however, gives some references to the 'American\r\nJournal of Science' which it is possible to make out by a careful search\r\nin the neighbourhood of the volume and page he mentions. In vol. iv.\r\n(1822,--Dr. Boué says 1821) there is an account by the editor[145] of a\r\nnatural ice-house in the township of Meriden, Con., between Hartford and\r\nNewhaven, at an elevation of not more than 200 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. The ice is found in a narrow defile, which is hemmed in by\r\nperpendicular sides of trap-rock, and displays a perfect chaos of fallen\r\nblocks of stone. The defile is so narrow, that the sun's rays only reach\r\nit for an hour in the course of the day; and even the trees and rocks,\r\nand beds of leaves, protect the ice from any very material damage. Dr.\r\nSilliman visited this defile on the 23rd July, 1821,[146] with Dr. Isaac\r\nHough, the keeper of a neighbouring inn, and found that the ice was only\r\npartially visible, in consequence of the large collection of leaves\r\nwhich lay on it: they sent a boy down with a hatchet, and he brought up\r\nsome large firm masses, one of which, weighing several pounds, they\r\ncarried twenty miles to Newhaven, where it did not entirely disappear\r\ntill the morning of the third day. Seven miles from Newhaven, in the\r\ntownship of Branford, there is a similar collection of ice. In both of\r\nthese cases, the ice is mixed with a considerable quantity of leaves and\r\ndirt.\r\n\r\nIn the same volume (p. 331,--Dr. Boué says p. 33), two accounts are\r\ngiven of a natural ice-house near the summit of a hill in the\r\nneighbourhood of Williamstown (Mass.). In the next volume there is a\r\nfurther account of it by Professor Dewey, stating that since the trees\r\nin the neighbourhood had been cut, the snow and ice had disappeared\r\neach year about the first of August.\r\n\r\nIn vol. xlvi. (p. 331) an ice mountain in Wallingford, Rutland County\r\n(Vt.), is described, which is ordinarily known in the neighbourhood as\r\nthe ice-bed. An area of thirty or fifty acres of ground is covered with\r\nmassive _débris_ of grey quartz from the mountains which overhang it;\r\nand here--especially in a deep ravine into which many of the falling\r\nblocks of stone have penetrated--ice is found in large quantities. It\r\nappears to be formed during the melting of the snow in February, March,\r\nand April, and vanishes in the course of the summer, in hot years as\r\nearly as the last days of June.\r\n\r\nThese descriptions call to mind the Glacière of Arc-sous-Cicon, in which\r\nmany of the features of the American ice-caves are reproduced. An\r\nAmerican photograph is current in this country, in the form of a\r\nstereoscopic slide, representing an ice-cave in the White Mountains, New\r\nHampshire; but it is only a winter cave, and in no way resembles any of\r\nthe glacières I have seen. It is merely a collection of long and slender\r\nicicles, with beds of ice formed upon stones and trunks of trees on the\r\nground; nothing more, in fact, than is to be seen in any tolerably\r\nsevere winter in the neighbourhood of a cascade in a sheltered Scotch\r\nburn.\r\n\r\nThe 'American Journal of Science' (xxxvi. 184) gives a curious instance\r\nof a freezing-well near the village of Owego, three-quarters of a mile\r\nfrom the Susquehanna river. The depth of the well is 77 feet, and for\r\nfour or five months in the year the surface of the water is frozen so\r\nhard as to render the well useless. Large masses of ice have been found\r\nin it late in July. A thermometer, which stood at 68° in the sun, fell\r\nto 30° in fifteen minutes at the bottom of the well; and the men who\r\nmade the well were forced to put on thick clothing in June, and even so\r\ncould not work for more than two hours at a time. No other well in that\r\nneighbourhood presents the same phenomenon. A lighted candle was let\r\ndown, and the flame became agitated and thrown in one direction at a\r\ndepth of 30 feet, but was quite still at the bottom; where, however, it\r\nsoon died out. The water is hard or limestone water.\r\n\r\nRocks of volcanic formation would seem to afford favourable\r\nopportunities for the formation of ice. Scrope mentions this fact in an\r\naccount of the curious district called Eiffel or Eifel, in Rhenish\r\nPrussia, which was published originally in the 'Edinburgh Journal of\r\nScience,'[147] and has since been translated in Keferstein's\r\nDeutschland.[148] The village of Roth, near Andernach, is built on a\r\ncurrent of basalt, derived from the cone above it, which has at some\r\ntime sent down a stream of lava to the north and west. A small cavern\r\nnear the village, forming the mouth of a deep fissure in the\r\nlava-stream, half-way up the cone, displays a phenomenon which the\r\nwriter says he has often observed in volcanic formations. The floor of\r\nthe cavern was covered with a crust of ice at the time of his visit,\r\nabout noon on a very hot day in August. The peasants report that there\r\nis always ice in summer, and never in winter, when the sheep retreat to\r\nthe cave on account of its warmth. Steininger[149] found a thickness of\r\n3 feet of ice on September 19, 1818, but it was evidently in a melting\r\nstate, and the thermometer stood at 36·5 F. in the cavern. He describes\r\nit as possessing a narrow entrance facing north, entirely sheltered from\r\nthe sun by lava-rocks, and by the trees of a wood which covers the cone\r\nof scoria.\r\n\r\nScrope believes that this is the mouth of one of the arched galleries so\r\nfrequently met with under lava in Iceland, Bourbon, and elsewhere; and\r\non this he founds his explanation of the phenomenon. If the other\r\nextremity is connected with the external air at a much lower level, a\r\ncurrent of air must be constantly driven up this gallery, and in its\r\npassage will be dried by the absorbent nature of the rock--which is\r\nperhaps partly owing to the sulphuric or muriatic acid it\r\ncontains[150]--and the evaporation caused by this current produces a\r\ncoating of ice on the floor of the grotto, where there is a superficial\r\nrill of water. The more rarified the lower external air, the more rapid\r\nwill be the current of cool air; and, therefore, the greater the\r\nevaporation. The winter phenomenon is to be explained by the fact that\r\nthe current of air will be about the mean annual temperature of the\r\ndistrict, taking its temperature, in fact, from the rocks through which\r\nit passes; and, therefore, by contrast the grotto will appear warm.\r\n\r\nThe same writer mentions a similar example of summer ice in\r\nAuvergne.[151] There is a natural grotto in the basalt near Pont Gibaud,\r\nsome miles to the north-west of Clermont, in which a small spring is\r\nfound partly frozen during the greatest heats of summer, while the water\r\nis said to be warm in winter; probably, Scrope observes, only seeming to\r\nbe warm by contrast with the external temperature. The water is\r\napparently frozen by means of the powerful evaporation produced by a\r\ncurrent of very dry air proceeding from some long fissures or arched\r\ngalleries which communicate with the cave. In this case also the writer\r\nsuggests that the air owes its dryness to the absorbent qualities of the\r\nlava through which it passes: he repeats, too, the remark that the\r\nphenomenon is of common occurrence in caverns in volcanic\r\ndistricts.[152]\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable instance of ice occurring under lava, near the\r\n_Casa Inglese_ on Mount Etna, which it may be as well to mention, though\r\nthe causes of its existence have probably nothing in common with the\r\nphenomena of ice-caves, or summer ice. An account of it is to be found\r\nin Sir Charles Lyell's 'Elements of Geology.'[153] It appears that the\r\nsummer and autumn of 1828 were so hot, that the artificial ice-houses of\r\nCatania and the adjoining parts of Sicily failed. Signer M. Gemmellaro\r\nhad long believed that a small mass of perennial ice at the foot of the\r\nhighest cone of Etna was only a part of a large and continuous glacier\r\ncovered by a lava current, and from this he expected to derive an\r\nabundant supply of ice. He procured a large body of workmen, and\r\nquarried into the ice; but though he thus proved the superposition of\r\nlava for several hundred yards, the ice was so hard, and the expense of\r\nquarrying consequently so great, that the works were abandoned. This was\r\non the south-east of the cone, not far from the _Casa Inglese_. Sir\r\nCharles Lyell suggests that, probably, at the commencement of some\r\neruption, a large mass of snow has been thickly covered with volcanic\r\nsand, showered upon it before the arrival of the lava itself. This sand\r\nis a non-conductor of heat, and would therefore tend to preserve the\r\nsnow from complete fusion when the hot lava-stream passed over it, and\r\nthus the existence of the underground glacier may be explained. The\r\npeasants of the district are so well acquainted with the non-conducting\r\nproperties of volcanic sand, that they secure an annual store of snow,\r\nfor providing water in summer, by strewing a layer of sand a few inches\r\nthick upon a field of snow, thus effectually shutting out the heat of\r\nthe sun. It is curious that when De Saussure visited Chamouni for the\r\nfirst time, his attention was arrested by the sight of women sowing what\r\nseemed to be grain of some kind in the snow; but, on enquiring, he found\r\nthat it was only black earth, which the inhabitants spread on the snow\r\nin spring, in order to make it disappear sooner. He was told that snow\r\nthus treated would melt a fortnight or three weeks before the ordinary\r\ntime for its disappearance in the valley; but it will be seen that this\r\ndoes not contradict the theory of the Sicilian peasants.[154]\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell adds that, after what he saw on Mount Etna, he should\r\nnot be surprised to find layers of glacier and lava alternating in some\r\nparts of Iceland.\r\n\r\nSomething similar was observed by Von Kotzebue, near the sound which\r\nbears his name.[155] His party was encamped on a large plain covered\r\nwith moss and grass, when they discovered a fissure which revealed the\r\nfact that the moss and grass were but a thin coating on a layer of ice a\r\nhundred feet thick. This was not mere frozen ground, but aboriginal ice;\r\nfor, in the ice which formed the walls of the fissure, they found the\r\nbones and teeth of mammoths embedded.\r\n\r\nThe frozen soil of Jakutsk, in Siberia, has for many years attracted\r\nconsiderable attention. The ordinary law of increase of temperature in\r\ndescending below the surface of the earth would appear, however, to be\r\nonly modified here; for it is found in sinking a well which has\r\nafforded opportunities for observing the state of the soil, that the\r\ntemperature gradually increases with the depth.[156]\r\n\r\nTwo ice-caverns were examined by Georgi, in the course of his travels in\r\nRussia.[157] One occurs near the mines of Lurgikan, on the east side of\r\na hill about 450 feet high, not far from the confluence of the Lurgikan\r\nstream with the Schilka (a tributary of the Amur), in the province of\r\nNertschinsk. In the course of driving an adit in one of the lead-mines,\r\nin the year 1770, the workmen were struck by the hollow sound given\r\nforth by the rock, and, on investigation, they found an immense grotto\r\nor fissure, of which the entrance was so much blocked up by ice that\r\nthey had much difficulty in sliding down by means of ropes. The fissure\r\nextended under the hill, in a direction from north to south, and was 130\r\nfathoms long, from 1 to 8 broad, and from 3 to 12 high. Where it\r\napproached nearest the surface, the thickness of the roof was about 10\r\nfathoms. The rock is described by Georgi as _quarzig, bräunlich, und von\r\neinem starken Kalkschuss_. He found the greater part of the walls\r\ncovered with ice, and many pillars and pyramids of ice on the floor. The\r\ncold was moderate, and was said to be much the same in summer and\r\nwinter. Patrin has given a fuller description of the same cavern in the\r\n_Journalde Physique_.[158] The lead-mine is in limestone rock,\r\ncontaining a third part of clay. The entrance to the glacière was still\r\ndifficult at the time of his visit, and it was necessary to use a rope,\r\nand also to cut steps, for the descent was made along a ridge of ice\r\nwith almost perpendicular sides. The spectacle presented by the\r\ndecoration of the roof was remarkably beautiful, long festoons and tufts\r\nof ice hanging down, light and brilliant as silver gauze: this ice was\r\nsupposed to be formed from the abundant vapours of the beginning of\r\nwinter, and resembled glass blown to the utmost tenuity. It was\r\ncrystallised, too, in a wonderful manner. Patrin found long bundles of\r\nhexahedral tubes, the walls of which were formed of transverse needles:\r\nthe diameter of these tubes was from two to six lines only, but at the\r\nlower extremities they opened out into hollow six-sided pyramids, more\r\nthan an inch in diameter, so that the festoons, sometimes as large round\r\nas a man, presented terminal tufts of some feet in diameter, which\r\nglittered like diamonds under the influence of the torches. Towards the\r\nfarther end of the fissure, stalactites of solid ice were found,\r\ndisplaying all the forms and more than all the beauty of limestone\r\nstalactites. The other instance mentioned by Georgi occurred in the\r\nmines of Serentvi, where two of the levels yielded perennial ice, and\r\nwere thence (Georgi says) called _Ledenoi_. A spring of water flowed\r\nfrom the rock at a depth of thirty fathoms below the surface, and was\r\npromptly frozen into a coating of ice a foot thick. Patrin[159] visited\r\nSerentvi, but he did not observe any ice in the mines. He believed the\r\nrock to be very ancient lava.\r\n\r\nReich[160] mentions a cavern on Mount Sorano which contains ice, quoting\r\nKircher;[161] but he seems to have misinterpreted his author's\r\nLatin.[162] He also refers to the existence of ice in the mines of\r\nHerrengrund in Hungary, and Dannemora in Sweden. Kircher, who has the\r\ncredit of having been the first to call attention to the increase of\r\ntemperature in the earth, made full enquiries into the temperature of\r\nthe mines at Herrengrund, but he was not informed of the existence of\r\nice.[163]; Townson visited these mines in the course of his travels in\r\nHungary, and neither does he make any mention of ice in connection with\r\nthem. He describes them as lying south of Teplitz, in a limestone\r\ndistrict, with sandstone in the more immediate neighbourhood. The mines\r\nthemselves (copper mines) are in a kind of mica-schist, which the people\r\ncall granite. The superintendent of mines informed Reich that one of the\r\nshafts is called the ice-mine, from the fact that when the workmen\r\nattempted to drive a gallery from south to north, they came upon ice\r\nfilling up the interstices of the _Haldenstein_, within five fathoms of\r\nthe commencement of the gallery. The temperature was so low, and the\r\nexpense caused by the frozen mass so great, that the working was\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nThe iron mines of Dannemora, eleven leagues from Upsal, contain a large\r\nquantity of ice, according to a manuscript account by Mr.\r\nOver-assessor-of-the-board-of-mines Winkler:[164] Jars, however, in his\r\n_Voyages Métallurgiques_,[165] gives a full description of them without\r\nmentioning the existence of ice. He states that ice is found in the\r\nmines of Nordmarck, three leagues from Philipstadt in Wermeland, a\r\nprovince of Sweden: these mines are merely numerous shafts sunk in the\r\nearth, reaching to the bottom of the vein of ore, so that they are fully\r\nexposed to the light, and yet the walls of the shafts become covered\r\nwith ice at the end of winter, which remains there till the middle of\r\nSeptember. Jars believed that, if it were not for the heat caused by\r\nblasting, and by the presence of the workmen, the ice would be\r\nperennial. Humboldt[166] speaks of the ice in these mines and on the\r\nSauberg. Reich states that ice is found in the mill-stone quarry of\r\nNieder-Mendig, quoting Karsten's _Archiv für Bergbau_.[167] The ice is\r\nfound in the hottest days of summer, although the interior of the quarry\r\nis connected with the outer air by many side shafts. The porous nature\r\nof the stone is assigned as the cause of the phenomenon. Daubeny (On\r\nVolcanoes) describes the remarkable basaltic deposits at\r\nNiedermennig--as he spells it--but says nothing of the existence of ice.\r\n\r\nDaubuisson[168] speaks of a _Schneegrube_, on a summit of the\r\n_Riesengebirge_, in Silesia, 4,000 feet above the sea; but such holes\r\nare common enough at that elevation, and I have seen two or three\r\nremarkable instances on the Jura, within the compass of one day's walk.\r\nVoigt[169] describes an _Eisgrube_ in the Rhöngebirge, on the\r\n_Ringmauer_, the highest point of the _Tagstein_, where abundant ice is\r\nfound in summer under irregular masses of columnar basalt. Reich had\r\nreceived from a forest-inspector an account of an ice-hole in this\r\nneighbourhood, called _Umpfen_, which is apparently not the same as that\r\nmentioned by Voigt.\r\n\r\nIn the Saxon Erzgebirge there are three points remarkable for their low\r\ntemperature,[170] in addition to the mines on the Sauberg mentioned\r\nabove. These are the _Heinrichssohle_, in the Stockwerk at Altenberg,\r\nwhere the mean of two years' observations gives the temperature 0°·54 F.\r\nlower at a depth of 400 feet than at the surface; the adit of\r\n_Henneberg_, on the Ingelbach, near Johanngeorgenstadt, where the\r\ntemperature was again 0°·54 F. lower than in shafts some hundred feet\r\nhigher; and the _Weiss Adler_ adit, on the left declivity of the valley\r\nof the Schwarzwasser, above the Antonshütte. It would appear that there\r\nare local causes which affect the temperature in the Erzgebirge, for\r\nReich found that in several places the mean temperature of the soil was\r\nhigher than that of the air: for instance--\r\n\r\n                         Soil.         Air.     Height above the sea.\r\n\r\n  Altenberg       ...   42·732° Fahr.  41·27°     2,450 feet\r\n  Markus Röhling  ...   43·542° \"      41·832°    1,870\"\r\n  Johanngeorgenstadt.   43·115° \"      41·09°     2,460\"\r\n\r\nThe temperature at Markus Röhling is peculiarly anomalous, considering\r\nthe elevation of the surface above the sea.\r\n\r\nThere is said to be an ice-cave in Nassau, but I have been unable to\r\nobtain any account of it, unless it be the same as the _ice-field_\r\nmentioned on page 303.\r\n\r\nThere is a cave in the south-east of Hungary[171] which presents the\r\nsame features as several of the glacières I have visited. It is called\r\nthe Ice-hole of Scherisciora, and is described as lying in the\r\nJura-kalk, at a distance of 2-1/2 hours north-east from the\r\nforest-house of Distidiul. The approach is by ladders, down a pit 30\r\nfathoms wide and 24 deep; and when the bottom of this pit is reached,\r\nan entrance is found to the cave in the north wall, in the\r\nneighbourhood of which is congealed snow which shortly becomes ice.\r\nThe floor of the first chamber is composed of glacier-ice, separated\r\nfrom the side walls by a cleft from 1 to 3 feet wide, where it shows a\r\ndepth of from 4 to 6 feet; it is as smooth as glass, and about 6\r\nfathoms from the entrance a cone of ice stands upon it, 8 or 9 feet\r\nhigh. Both the floor and the cone are at once seen to be transformed\r\nremains of ancient masses of snow, and are of a dirty yellow colour.\r\n\r\nAt the back of this chamber, a narrow passage opens towards the interior\r\nof the mountain, and winds steeply down with a height of 4 feet, and a\r\nlength of a few fathoms, till a magnificent dome is reached, on the\r\nbeauties of which Herr Peters becomes eloquent. The floor is so smooth\r\nthat crimpons are necessary, and stalagmites and stalactites of ice are\r\nfound in rich profusion, the latter being generally formed on small\r\nlimestone stalactites, while the former have no such nucleus.\r\n\r\nThere is another opening near the original entrance to the cave, a sort\r\nof fissure covered with elegant forms of ice, leading to a steep shaft.\r\nThe imperial forester of Topfanalva was bold enough to let himself down\r\nthe slope of ice which formed the edge of the shaft, on a rope ladder 60\r\nfeet long, notwithstanding the difficulty of grasping the iron steps\r\nwhich of course lay pressed on to the ice; but when he had descended\r\nabout 30 feet, the shaft became perpendicular, and stones thrown in\r\nshowed a very considerable depth. There appeared to be no sound of water\r\nin the abyss below.\r\n\r\nBoth entrances, that to the shaft as well as that to the second chamber,\r\nwere ornamented with delicate ice crystals, which occurred both on the\r\nlimestone stalactites and on the walls, and presented almost the\r\nappearance of plants of cauliflower. The ice-floor of the first chamber\r\nis described as consisting of a 'coarse-grained' material.\r\n\r\nIn the south-east of Servia, on the western slope of Mount Rtagn, is a\r\npit 20 feet in diameter, and 40 or 50 feet deep, the bottom of which is\r\nreached by a succession of trunks of trees with the branches lopped off,\r\na sort of ladder called _stouba_ by the natives.[172] The peasants\r\nassert that the snow and ice disappear from this pit in September, and\r\ndo not reappear before June. The Swiss peasants have never yet got so\r\nfar as to say that the _snow_ in their pits disappears in winter and\r\nreturns in summer. Boué[173] found the temperature of the bottom of the\r\npit to be 28°.4 F., while that of the air outside was 76° F. The same\r\nwriter[174] mentions a source in a mill-stone quarry in Bosnia which is\r\nfrozen till the end of June.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Several of these caves are referred to by Reich,\r\n_Beobachtungen über die Temperatur des Gesteins in verschiedenen Tiefen\r\nin den Gruben des Sächsischen Erzgebirges;_ Freiberg, 1834.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: _Naturwunder des Oesterr.

Girou de Buzareingues _(Ann. de Chimie et de Phys_., xlv. 362)\r\nfound that with a strong north wind, the temperature of the external air\r\nbeing 55º·4 F., the coldest current gave 35º·6 F.; with less external\r\nwind, still blowing from the north, the external air lost half a degree\r\ncentigrade of heat, while the current in the cave rose to 38º·75 F. The\r\ncellars in which the famous cheese of Roquefort is ripened are not\r\nsubterranean, but are buildings joined on to the rock at the mouths of\r\nthe fissures whence the currents proceed.

The idolaters of Gevaudan offered cheeses to demons by\r\nthrowing them into a lake on the Mons Helanus _(Laz des Helles?_) and it\r\nwas not till the year 550 that S.

Gollut, the author, speaks more\r\nthan once of a _glacière_ in his topographical descriptions, and in a\r\nshort account of it he states that it lay near the village of _Leugné_,\r\nwhich I find marked in the Delphinal Atlas very near the site of the\r\nChartreuse of Grâce-Dieu; so that there can be no doubt that his\r\nglacière was the same with that which now exists. His theory was, that\r\nthe dense covering of trees and shrubs protected the soil and the\r\nsurface-water from the rays of the sun, and so the cold which was stored\r\nup in the cave was enabled to withstand the attacks of the heat of\r\nsummer.[175] In the case of many of the glacières, there can be no\r\ndoubt that this idea of winter cold being so preserved, by natural\r\nmeans, as to resist the encroachments of the hotter seasons, is the true\r\nexplanation of the phenomenon of underground ice.\r\n\r\nThe next account of this glacière is found in the History of the Royal\r\nAcademy of Sciences (French), under the year 1686,[176] but no theory is\r\nthere suggested. The writer of the account states that in his time the\r\nfloor of the cave was covered with ice, and that ice hung from the roof\r\nin festoons. In winter the cave was full of thick vapours, and a stream\r\nof water ran through it. The ice had for long been less abundant than in\r\nformer times, in consequence of the felling of some trees which had\r\nstood near the entrance.\r\n\r\nThe Academy received in the same year another letter on this subject,\r\nconfirming the previous account, and adding some particulars. From this\r\nit would seem that people flocked from all sides to the glacière with\r\nwaggons and mules, and conveyed the ice through the various parts of\r\nBurgundy, and to the camp of the Saone; not thereby diminishing the\r\namount of ice, for one hot day produced as much as they could carry away\r\nin eight days. The ice seemed to be formed from a stream which ran\r\nthrough the cave and was frozen in the summer only. The writer of this\r\nsecond account saw vapours in the glacière (the editor of the _Histoire\r\nde l'Académie_ does not say at what season the visit to the cave took\r\nplace), and was informed that this was an infallible sign of approaching\r\nrain; so much so, that the peasants were in the habit of determining the\r\ncoming weather by the state of the grotto.\r\n\r\nIn 1712, M. Billerez, Professor of Anatomy and Botany in the University\r\nof Besançon, communicated to the Academy[177] an account of a visit made\r\nby him to this cave in September 1711. He found 3 feet of ice on the\r\nfloor of the cave, in a state of incipient thaw, and three pyramids,\r\nfrom 15 to 20 feet high and 5 or 6 feet in diameter, which had been\r\nalready considerably reduced in size by thaw. A vapour was beginning to\r\npass out from the cave, at the highest part of the arch of entrance; a\r\nphenomenon which, he was told, continued through the winter, and\r\nannounced or accompanied the departure of the ice: nevertheless, the\r\ncold was so great that he could not remain in the glacière more than\r\nhalf an hour with any sort of comfort. The thermometer stood at 60°\r\noutside the cave, and fell to 10°[178] when placed inside; but\r\nthermometrical observations of that date were so vague as to be useless\r\nfor present purposes. The ice appeared to be harder than the ordinary\r\nice of rivers, less full of air-bubbles, and more difficult to melt.\r\n\r\nM. Billerez enunciated a new theory to account for the phenomena\r\npresented by the cave. He observed that the earth in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood, and especially above the roof of the grotto, was full of\r\na nitrous or ammoniac salt, and he accordingly suggested that this salt\r\nwas disturbed by the heat of summer and mingled itself with the water\r\nwhich penetrated by means of fissures to the grotto, and so the cave was\r\naffected in the same way as the smaller vessel in the ordinary\r\npreparation of artificial ice. He had heard that some rivers in China\r\nfreeze in summer from the same cause.[179]\r\n\r\nIn 1726, a further communication was made to the Academy by M. des\r\nBoz,[181] Royal Engineer, describing four visits which he had made to\r\nthe grotto near Besançon at four different seasons of the year, viz., in\r\nMay and November 1725, and in March and August 1726. In all cases he\r\nfound the air in the cave colder than the external air,[182] and its\r\nvariations in temperature corresponded with the external variations, the\r\ncold being greater in winter than in summer.\r\n\r\nM. des Boz ascribed the existence of ice in the cave to natural causes.\r\nThe opening being towards the north-east, and corresponding with a gorge\r\nin the hills opposite, running in the same direction, none but cold\r\nwinds could reach the mouth of the grotto. Moreover, the soil above was\r\nso thickly covered with trees and brushwood, that the rays of the sun\r\ncould not reach the earth, much less the rock below. Credible persons\r\nasserted that since some of the trees had been felled, there had not\r\nbeen so much ice in the cave.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the presence of salt, M. des Boz melted some of the\r\nice, and evaporated the resulting water, but found no taste of salt in\r\nthe matter which remained.[183] He denied the existence of the spring of\r\nwater which previous accounts had mentioned, and believed that the water\r\nwhich formed the ice came solely from melted snow, and from the\r\nfissures of the rock.\r\n\r\nIn 1727, the Duc de Lévi caused the whole of the ice to be removed from\r\nthe cave, for the use of the army of the Saone, which he commanded. In\r\n1743 the ice had formed again, and the grotto was subjected to a very\r\ncareful investigation by M. de Cossigny, chief engineer of Besançon, in\r\nthe months of August and October.[183] The thermometer he used had been\r\npresented to him by the Academy, and was very probably constructed by M.\r\nde Réaumur himself, for de Cossigny's account was sent through M. de\r\nRéaumur to the Academy, but still the observations made with it cannot\r\nbe considered very trustworthy. On the 8th of August, at 7.30 A.M., the\r\ntemperature in the cave was 1/2° above the zero point of this\r\nthermometer, and at 11.30 A.M. it had risen to 1° above zero. On the\r\n17th of October, at 7 A.M., the thermometer stood at 1/2°, and at 4 P.M.\r\nit gave the same register.\r\n\r\nM. de Cossigny found that the entrance to the cave was rather more than\r\n150 feet above the Abbey of Grâce-Dieu, and about half a league distant\r\nby the ordinary path. A great part of his account is occupied by\r\ncontradictions of previous accounts, especially in the matter of\r\ndimensions,[184] The people of Besançon had urged him to stay only a\r\nshort time in the cave, because of the sulphureous and nitrous\r\nexhalations, but he detected no symptoms of anything of that kind. The\r\nmost curious thing which he saw was the soft earth which lay, and still\r\nlies, at the bottom of the long slope of ice by which the descent is\r\nmade; and he subjected this to various chemical tests and processes, but\r\ncould not find that it contained anything different from ordinary\r\nearth.[185]\r\n\r\nWhen M. de Cossigny visited the cave, there were thirteen or fourteen\r\ncolumns of ice, from 6 to 8 feet high, and he was in consequence\r\ninclined to doubt the accuracy of the statement of M. Billerez, that in\r\nhis time (1711) there were three columns only, from 15 to 20 feet high.\r\nBut my own observation of the shape of the columns suggested that the\r\nlargest of all was probably an amalgamation of several others; so that\r\nit is not unreasonable to suppose that after the Duc de Lévi removed the\r\nlarge columns seen by M. Billerez, a number of smaller columns were\r\nformed on the old site, and that these had not become large enough to\r\namalgamate in 1743.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with these visits of August and October, M. de Cossigny\r\nvisited the cave in April 1745. He found the temperature at 5 A.M. to be\r\nexactly at the freezing point, and at noon it had risen 1°. From this he\r\nconcluded that the stories of the greater cold in the cave during the\r\nsummer, as compared with the winter, were false.\r\n\r\nIn 1769, M. Prévost, of Geneva, visited the cave, as a young man; and in\r\n1789, he wrote an account of his visit in the _Journal de Genève_\r\n(March), which was afterwards inserted as an additional chapter in his\r\nbook on Heat.[186] He believed that one or two hundred _toises_ was the\r\nutmost that could be allowed for the height of the hill in which the\r\nglacière lies,--a sufficiently vague approximation. He rejected the idea\r\nof salt as the cause of ice, and came to the conclusion that the cave\r\nwas in fact nothing more than a good natural ice-house, being protected\r\nby dense trees, and a thick roof of rock, while its opening towards the\r\nnorth sheltered it from all warm winds. He accounted for the original\r\npresence of ice as follows:--In the winter, stalactites form at the\r\nedges of various fissures in the roof, and snow is drifted on to the\r\nfloor of the cave by the north winds down the entrance-slope. When the\r\nwarmer weather comes, the stalactites fall by their own weight, and,\r\nlying in the drifted and congealed snow, form nuclei round which the\r\nsnow is still further congealed, and the water which results from the\r\npartial thaw of portions of the snow is also converted into ice. Thus, a\r\nlarger collection of ice forms in winter than the heat of summer can\r\ndestroy; and if none of it were removed, it might, in the course of\r\nyears, almost fill the cave. At the time of his visit (August), M.\r\nPrévost found only one column, from 6 to 8 feet high.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 (August 6), M. Girod-Chantrans visited the Glacière of Chaux\r\n(so called from a village near the glacière, on the opposite side from\r\nthe Abbey of Grâce-Dieu), and his account of the visit appeared in the\r\n_Journal des Mines_[187] of Prairial, an iv., by which time the writer\r\nhad become the Citizen Girod-Chantrans. He found a mass of\r\nstalactites of ice hanging from the roof, as if seeking to join\r\nthemselves with corresponding stalagmites on the floor of the cave;\r\nthe latter, five in number, being not more than 3 or 4 feet high, and\r\nstanding on a thick sheet of ice. There was a sensible interval\r\nbetween this basement of ice and the rock and stones on which it\r\nreposed: it was, moreover, full of holes containing water, and the\r\nlower parts of the cave were unapproachable by reason of the large\r\nquantity of water which lay there. The thermometer stood at 35°·9 F.\r\ntwo feet above the floor, and at 78° F. in the shade outside. M.\r\nGirod-Chantrans determined, from all he saw and heard, that the summer\r\nfreezing and winter thaw were fables, and he believed that the cave\r\nwas only an instance of Nature's providing the same sort of receptacle\r\nfor ice as men provide in artificial ice-houses. He was fortunate\r\nenough to obtain by chance the notes of a neighbouring physician, who\r\nhad made careful observations and experiments in the glacière at\r\nvarious seasons of the year, and a _précis_ of these notes forms the\r\nmost valuable part of his account.\r\n\r\nDr. Oudot, the physician in question, found ten columns in January 1778,\r\nthe largest of which was 5-1/2 feet high. The flooring of ice was\r\nnowhere more than 15 inches thick, and the parts of the rock which were\r\nnot covered with ice were perfectly dry. The thermometer--M.\r\nGirod-Chantrans used Réaumur, so I suppose that he gives Dr. Oudot's\r\nobservations in degrees of Réaumur, though some of the results of that\r\nsupposition appear to be anomalous--gave 22° F. within the cave, and 21°\r\nF. outside.\r\n\r\nIn April of the same year, the large column had increased in height to\r\nthe extent of 13 inches; and the floor of ice on which it stood was\r\n1-1/2 inch thicker, and extended over a larger area than before; the\r\nthermometer stood at 36°.5 F. and 52° F. respectively in the same\r\npositions as in the former case. In July, the large column had lost 6\r\ninches of its height, and the thermometer gave 38°.75 F. and 74°.75 F.\r\n\r\nIn October, the large column was only 3 feet high, and many of the\r\nothers had disappeared, while their pedestal had become much thinner\r\nthan it had been in the preceding months. There was also a considerable\r\namount of mud in the cave, brought down apparently by the heavy rains of\r\nautumn. The thermometer gave 37°.6 F. and 63°.5 F.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of January, 1779, there were nine columns of very beautiful\r\nice, and one of these, as before, was larger than the rest, being 5 feet\r\nhigh and 10 feet in circumference. The temperatures were 21° F. and\r\n16°.15 F. in the cave and in the open air respectively.\r\n\r\nTradition related that, before the removal of the ice in 1727, one of\r\nthe columns reached the roof, (Prévost calculated the limits of the\r\nheight of the cave at 90 and 60 feet,) and this suggested to Dr. Oudot\r\nthe idea of placing stakes of wood in the heads of the columns he found\r\nin the cave, in the hope that ice would thus collect in greater\r\nquantities under the fissures of the roof. Accordingly, he made holes in\r\nthree of the columns, and established stakes 4, 5, and 10 feet high,\r\nreturning on the 22nd of February, after an interval of six weeks, to\r\nobserve the result of his experiment. He found the two shorter stakes\r\ncompletely masked with ice, forming columns a foot in diameter; and the\r\nlongest stake, though not entirely concealed by the ice which had\r\ncollected upon it, was crowned with a beautiful capital of perfectly\r\ntransparent ice. The columns which had no stakes fixed upon them had\r\nalso increased somewhat in size, but not nearly in the same proportion\r\nas those which were the subject of Dr. Oudot's experiment. The\r\nthermometer on this day gave 29°.5 F. and 59° F. as the temperatures.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that I found one very beautiful column, far higher\r\nthan any of those mentioned by Dr. Oudot, and higher than those which M.\r\nBillerez saw, formed upon the trunk and branches of a fir-tree. I have\r\nnow no doubt that the peculiar shape of another--the largest of the\r\nthree columns which were in the cave at the time of my visit--is due to\r\nthe fact of its being a collection of several smaller columns, which\r\nhave in course of time flowed into one as they increased separately in\r\nbulk, and that its height has been augmented by a device similar to that\r\nadopted by Dr. Oudot. The two magnificent capitals which this column\r\npossessed, as well as the numerous smaller capitals which sprang from\r\nits sides, will thus be completely accounted for.\r\n\r\nOne more account may be mentioned, before I proceed to the theory which\r\nhas found most favour in Switzerland of late years. M. Cadet published\r\nsome _Conjectures_ on the formation of the ice in this cavern, in the\r\n_Annales de Chimie,_ Nivôse, an XI.[188] He saw the cave in the end of\r\nSeptember 1791, and found very little ice--not a third of what there had\r\nbeen a month before, according to the account of his guide. The\r\n_limonadier_ of a public garden in Besançon informed him that the people\r\nof that town resorted to the glacière for ice when the supplies of the\r\nartificial ice-houses failed, and that they chose a hot day for this\r\npurpose, because on such days there was more ice in the cave. Ten\r\n_chars_ would have been sufficient to remove all the ice M. Cadet found,\r\nand the air inside the cave seemed to be not colder than the external\r\nair; but, nevertheless, M. Cadet believed the old story of the greater\r\nabundance of ice in summer than in winter, and he attempted to account\r\nfor the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe ground above and near the cave is covered with beech and chestnut\r\ntrees, and thus is protected from the rays of the sun. The leaves of\r\nthese trees give forth abundant moisture, which has been pumped up\r\nfrom their roots; and as this moisture passes from the liquid to the\r\ngaseous state, it absorbs a large quantity of caloric. Thus,\r\nthroughout the summer, the atmosphere is incessantly refrigerated by\r\nthe evaporation produced by the trees round the cave; whereas in\r\nwinter no such process goes on, and the cave assumes a moderate\r\ntemperature, such as is usually found in ordinary caves. Unfortunately\r\nfor M. Cadet's theory, the facts are not in accordance with his\r\nimaginary data, nor yet with his conclusions. He adds, on the\r\nauthority of one of his friends, that the intendant of the province,\r\nM. de Vanolles, wishing to preserve a larger amount of ice in the\r\ncave, built up the entrance with a wall 20 feet high, in which a small\r\ndoor was made, and the keys were left in the hands of the authorities\r\nof the neighbouring village, with orders that no ice should be\r\nremoved. The effect of this was, that the ice diminished considerably,\r\nand they were obliged to pull down the wall again. M. Cadet saw the\r\nremains of the wall, and the story was confirmed by the Brothers of\r\nGrâce-Dieu. It would be very interesting to know at what season this\r\nwall was built, and when it was pulled down. If my ideas on the\r\nsubject of ice-caves are correct, it would be absolutely fatal to shut\r\nout the heavy cold air of winter from the grotto.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, M.A. Pictet, of Geneva, took up the question of natural\r\nglacières, and read a paper before the Helvetic Society of Natural\r\nSciences,[189] describing his visits to the caves of the Brezon and the\r\nValley of Reposoir. In order to explain the phenomena presented by those\r\ncaves, M. Pictet adopted De Saussure's theory of the principle of\r\n_caves-froides_, rendering it somewhat more precise, and extending it\r\nto meet the case of ice-caves. It is well known that, in many parts of\r\nthe world, cold currents are found to blow from the interstices of\r\nrocks; and these are utilised by neighbouring proprietors, who build\r\nsheds over the fissures, and so secure a cool place for keeping meat,\r\n&c. Examples of such currents are met with near Rome (in the _Monte\r\nTestaceo_), at Lugano, Lucerne (the caves of Hergiswyl), and in various\r\nother districts. It is found that the hotter the day, the stronger is\r\nthe current of cold air; in winter the direction of the current is\r\nchanged, and it blows into the rock instead of out from it.[190] De\r\nSaussure's theory, as developed by M. Pictet, was no doubt satisfactory,\r\nso far as it was used to account for the phenomenon of 'cold-caves,' but\r\nit seems to be insufficient as an explanation of the existence of large\r\nmasses of subterranean ice; of which, by the way, De Saussure must have\r\nbeen entirely ignorant, for he makes no allusion to such ice, and the\r\ntemperatures of the coldest of his caves were considerably above the\r\nfreezing point.\r\n\r\nPictet represents the case of a cave with cold currents of air to be\r\nmuch the same as that of a mine with a vertical shaft, ending in a\r\nhorizontal gallery of which one extremity is in communication with the\r\nopen air, at a point much lower, of course, than the upper extremity of\r\nthe shaft. The cave corresponds to the horizontal gallery, and the\r\nvarious fissures in the rock take the place of the vertical shaft, and\r\ncommunicate freely with the external air. In summer, the columns of air\r\ncontained in these fissures assume nearly the temperature of the rock in\r\nwhich they rest, that is to say, the mean temperature of the district,\r\nand therefore they are heavier than the corresponding external columns\r\nof air which terminate at the mouth of the cave; for the atmosphere in\r\nsummer is very much above the mean temperature of the soil, or of the\r\ninterior of the earth at moderate depths. The consequence is, that the\r\nheavy cool air descends from the fissures, and streams out into the\r\ncave, appearing as a cold current; and the hotter the day is--that is,\r\nthe lighter the columns of external air--the more violent will be the\r\ndisturbance of equilibrium, and therefore the more palpable the cold\r\ncurrent. Naturally, in this last case, the air which enters by the upper\r\norifices of the fissures is more heated, to begin with, than on cooler\r\ndays; but external heat so very slightly affects the deeper parts of the\r\nfissures, that the columns of air thus introduced are speedily impressed\r\nwith the mean temperature of the district. In winter, the external\r\ncolumns of air are as much heavier than the columns in the fissures as\r\nthey are lighter in summer; and so cold currents of air blow from the\r\ncave into the fissures, though such currents are not of course colder\r\nthan the external air. Thus the mean temperature of the cave is much\r\nlower than that of the rock in which it occurs; for the temperature of\r\nthe currents varies from the mean temperature of the rock to the winter\r\ntemperature of the external atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe descending columns of warmer air, in summer, must to some extent\r\nraise the temperature of the fissures above that which they would\r\notherwise possess, that is, above the mean temperature of the place; but\r\nthat may be considered to be counteracted by the corresponding lowering\r\nof the temperature of the fissures by the introduction of cold air from\r\nthe cave in winter. By a similar reasoning, it will be seen that for\r\nsome time after the spring change of direction in the currents takes\r\nplace, the temperature of the cave will be less than would have been\r\nexpected from a calculation founded on the true mean temperature of the\r\nrock through which the fissures pass. This, together with the fact of\r\nthe porous nature of the rock in which most of the curious caves in the\r\nworld occur, which allows a considerable amount of moisture to collect\r\non all surfaces, and thereby induces a depression of temperature by\r\nevaporation, may be held to explain the presence of a greater amount of\r\ncold than might otherwise have been fairly reckoned upon in ice-caves.\r\n\r\nThe idea of cold produced by evaporation Pictet took up warmly,\r\nbelieving that when promoted by rapid currents of air it would produce\r\nice in the summer months; and he thus explained what he understood to be\r\nthe phenomena of glacières. But it will have been seen, from the account\r\nof the caves I have visited, that the glacières are more or less in a\r\nstate of thaw in the summer; and M. Thury's observations in the winter\r\nprove conclusively that they are then in a state of utter frost, so that\r\nthe old belief with respect to the season at which the ice is formed may\r\nbe supposed to have been exploded. The facts recorded by Mr. Scrope[191]\r\nwould appear to depend upon the peculiar nature of rocks of volcanic\r\nformation; and I am inclined to think there is very little in common\r\nbetween such instances as he mentions and the large caves filled with\r\nice which are to be found in the primary or secondary limestone.\r\n\r\nOne of De Saussure's experiments, in the course of his investigation of\r\nthe phenomena and causes of cold currents in caves, is worth recalling.\r\nHe passed a current of air through a glass tube an inch in diameter,\r\nfilled with moistened stones, and by that means succeeded in reducing\r\nthe temperature of the current from 18° C. to 15° C.; and when the\r\nrefrigerated current was directed against a wet-bulb thermometer, it\r\nfell to 14° C., thus showing a loss of 7°·2 F. of heat. No one can see\r\nmuch of limestone caverns without discovering that the surfaces over\r\nwhich any currents there may be are constrained to pass, present an\r\nabundance of moisture to refrigerate the currents; and it is not\r\nunreasonable to suppose that the large number of evaporating surfaces,\r\nwhich currents passing through heaps of débris--such as the basaltic\r\nstones described on page 261--come in contact with, are the main cause\r\nof the specially low temperature observed under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nPictet's theory, however, did not convince all those into whose hands\r\nhis paper fell, and M.J. Deluc wrote against it in the _Annales de\r\nChimie et de Physique_ of the same year, 1822.[192] Deluc had not seen\r\nany glacière, but he was enabled to decide against the cold-current\r\ntheory by a perusal of Pictet's own details, and of one of the accounts\r\nof the cave near Besançon. He objected, that in many cases the ice is\r\nfound to melt in summer, instead of forming then; and also, that in the\r\nGlacière of S. Georges, which Pictet had described, there was no current\r\nwhatever. Further, in all the cases of cold currents investigated or\r\nmentioned by De Saussure, the presence of summer ice was never even\r\nhinted at, and the lowest temperatures observed by him were considerably\r\nabove the freezing point. I may add, from my own experience, that on the\r\nonly occasions on which I found a decided current in a glacière--viz.,\r\nin the Glacière of Monthézy, and that of Chappet-sur-Villaz,--there was\r\nmarked thaw in connection with the current. In the latter case, the\r\nchannel from which the current came was filled with water; and in the\r\nformer, water stood on the surface of the ice.\r\n\r\nThe view which Deluc adopted was one which I have myself independently\r\nformed; and he would probably have written with more force if he had\r\nbeen acquainted with various small details relating to the position and\r\nsurroundings of many of the caves. The heavy cold air of winter sinks\r\ndown into the glacières, and the lighter warm air of summer cannot on\r\nordinary principles of gravitation dislodge it, so that heat is very\r\nslowly spread in the caves; and even when some amount of heat does reach\r\nthe ice, the latter melts but slowly, for ice absorbs 60° C. of heat in\r\nmelting; and thus, when ice is once formed, it becomes a material\r\nguarantee for the permanence of cold in the cave.\r\n\r\nFor this explanation to hold good, it is necessary that the level at\r\nwhich the ice is found should be below the level of the entrance to the\r\ncave; otherwise the mere weight of the cold air would cause it to leave\r\nits prison as soon as the spring warmth arrived. In every single case\r\nthat has come under my observation, this condition has been emphatically\r\nfulfilled. It is necessary, also, that the cave should be protected from\r\ndirect radiation, as the gravitation of cold air has nothing to do with\r\nresistance to that powerful means of introducing heat. This condition,\r\nalso, is fulfilled by nature in all the glacières I have visited,\r\nexcepting that of S. Georges; and there art has replaced the protection\r\nformerly afforded by the thick trees which grew over the hole of\r\nentrance. The effect of the second hole in the roof of this glacière is\r\nto destroy all the ice which is within range of the sun. A third and\r\nvery necessary condition is, that the wind should not be allowed access\r\nto the cave; for if it were, it would infallibly bring in heated air, in\r\nspite of the specific weight of the cold air stored within. It will be\r\nunderstood from my descriptions of such glacières as that of the Grand\r\nAnu, of Monthézy, and the Lower Glacière of the Pré de S. Livres, how\r\ncompletely sheltered from all winds the entrances to those caves are.\r\nThere can be no doubt, too, that the large surfaces which are available\r\nfor evaporation have much to do with maintaining a somewhat lower\r\ntemperature than the mean temperature of the place where the cave\r\noccurs. This had been noticed so long ago as Kircher's time; for among\r\nthe answers which his questions received from the miners of Herrengrund,\r\nwe find it stated that, so long as mines are dry, the deeper they are\r\nthe hotter; but if they have water, they are less warm, however deep.\r\nFrom the mines of Schemnitz he was informed that, so long as the free\r\npassage of air was not hindered, the mines remained temperate; in other\r\ncases they were very warm. Another great advantage which some glacières\r\npossess must be borne in mind, namely, the collection of snow at the\r\nbottom of the pit in which the entrance lies. This snow absorbs, in the\r\ncourse of melting, all heat which strikes down by radiation or is driven\r\ndown by accidental turns of the wind; and the snow-water thus forced\r\ninto the cave will, at any rate, not seriously injure the ice. It is\r\nworthy of notice that the two caves which possess the greatest depth of\r\nice, so far as I have been able to fathom it, are precisely those which\r\nhave the greatest deposit of snow; and the ice in a third cave, that of\r\nMonthézy, which has likewise a large amount of snow in the entrance-pit,\r\npresents the appearance of very considerable depth. The Schafloch, it is\r\ntrue, which contains an immense bulk of ice, has no snow; but its\r\nelevation is great, as compared with that of some of the caves, and\r\ntherefore the mean temperature of the rock in which it occurs is less\r\nunfavourable to the existence of ice.\r\n\r\nI believe that the true explanation of the curious phenomena presented\r\nby these caves in general, is to be found in Deluc's theory, fortified\r\nby such facts as those which I have now stated. The mean temperature of\r\nthe rock at Besançon, where the elevation above the sea is\r\ncomparatively so small, renders the temptation to suggest some chemical\r\ncause very strong.\r\n\r\nThe question of ice in summer where thaw prevails in winter, may fairly\r\nbe considered to have been eliminated from the discussion of such caves\r\nas I have seen, in spite of the persistent assertions of some of the\r\npeasantry. The observations, however, in caverns in volcanic formations,\r\nand in basaltic débris, are so circumstantial that it is impossible to\r\nreject them; and in such cases a theory similar to that enunciated by\r\nMr. Scrope[193] seems to be the only one in any way satisfactory, though\r\nI have not heard of such marvellous results being produced elsewhere by\r\nevaporation. One observer, for instance, of the cavern near the village\r\nof Both, in the Eiffel, found a thickness of 3 feet of ice; and in that\r\ncase it was melting in summer, instead of forming. In some cases it has\r\nbeen suggested that the length of time required for external heat or\r\ncold to penetrate through the earth and rock which lie above the caves\r\nis sufficient to account for the phenomenon of summer frost and winter\r\nthaw. Thus, it is said, the thickness of the superincumbent bed may be\r\nsuch that the heat of summer only gets through to the cave at Christmas,\r\nand then produces thaw, while in like manner the greatest cold will\r\nreach the cave in mid-summer. But there is a fatal objection to this\r\nidea in the fact that the invariable stratum--i.e., the stratum beyond\r\nwhich the annual changes of external temperature are not felt--is\r\nreached about 60 feet below the surface in temperate latitudes,[194]\r\nwhile at the tropics such changes are not felt more than a foot below\r\nthe surface. Humboldt calculated that in the latitude of central France\r\nthe whole annual variation in temperature at a depth of 30 feet would\r\nnot amount to more than one degree.[195]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: As Gollut's phraseology is peculiar, it may be as well\r\nto reproduce his account of the cave:--'Je ne veux pas omettre\r\ntoutefois (puisque je suis en ces eaux) de mettre en memoire la\r\ncommodité que nature hat doné à quelques delicats, puis qu'au fond\r\nd'un mõntagne de Leugné, la glace (_glasse_ in the index), se treuve\r\nen esté, pour le plaisir de ceux qui aim[~e]t a boire frais.

On this\r\npoint M. Thury's visit to the Glacière of S. Georges in the spring of\r\n1852 affords valuable information, for at that time the coating of ice\r\non the wall, evidently newly formed, did not present the _structure\r\naréolaire_ which he had observed in his summer visit to the cave. He\r\nsuggests that, since ice is less coherent at a temperature of 32°\r\nF.--which is approximately the temperature of the ice-caves during\r\nseveral months of the year--than when exposed to a greater degree of\r\ncold, its molecules will then become free to assume a fresh system of\r\narrangement.[196] On the other hand, Professor Faraday has found that\r\nice formed under a temperature some degrees below the ordinary freezing\r\npoint has a well-marked crystalline structure.[197] M. Thury suggests\r\nalso, as a possibility, what I have found to be the case, by frequent\r\nobservations, that the prismatic ice has greater power of resisting heat\r\nthan ordinary ice; and on this supposition he accounts for the fact of\r\nhollow stalactites being found in the Cavern of S. Georges.[198] At the\r\ncommencement of the hot season, the atmospheric temperature of the\r\nglacières rises gradually; and when it has almost reached 32° F., the\r\nprismatic change takes place in the ice, extending to a limited depth\r\nbelow the surface. The central parts of the stalactites retain their\r\nordinary structure, and are after a time exposed to a general\r\ntemperature rather above than below the freezing point; and thus they\r\ncome to melt, the water escaping either by accidental fissures between\r\nsome of the prisms, or by the extremity of the stalactite, or by some\r\npart of the surface which has chanced to escape the prismatic\r\narrangement, and has itself melted under increased temperature.[199]\r\n\r\nM. Héricart de Thury describes the peculiar structure of the ice which\r\nhe found in the Glacière of the Foire de Fondeurle.[200] He found that\r\nthe crystallised portions were very distinctly marked, displaying for\r\nthe most part a six-sided arrangement; and in the interior of a hollow\r\nstalactite he found numerous needles of ice perfectly crystallised, the\r\ncrystals being some triangular and some six-sided. He was unable to\r\ndetect any perfect pyramid.[201] I have already quoted Olafsen's\r\nobservations on the polygonal lining which he saw on the surface of the\r\nice in the Surtshellir. The French Encyclopædia [202] relates that M.\r\nHassenfratz saw ice served up at table at Chambéry which broke into\r\nhexagonal prisms; and when he was shown the ice-houses where it was\r\nstored, he found considerable blocks of ice containing hexahedral prisms\r\nterminated by corresponding pyramids.\r\n\r\nIn vol. xv. (New Series) of the American Journal of Science,[203] an\r\nextract is given from a letter describing the 'Ice Spring' in the Rocky\r\nMountains, which the mountaineers consider to be one of the curiosities\r\nof the great trail from the States to Oregon and California. It is\r\nsituated in a low marshy 'swale' to the right of the Sweetwater river,\r\nand about forty miles from the South Pass. The ground is filled with\r\nsprings; and about 18 inches below the turf lies a smooth and horizontal\r\nsheet of ice, which remains the year round, protected by the soil and\r\ngrass above it. On July 12th, 1849, it was from 2 to 4 inches thick; but\r\none of the guides stated that he had seen it a foot deep. It was\r\nperfectly clear, and disposed in hexagonal prisms, separating readily at\r\nthe natural joints. The ice had a slightly saline taste,[204] the ground\r\nabove it being impregnated with salt, and the water near tasting of\r\nsulphur. The upper surface of the stratum of ice was perfectly smooth.\r\n\r\nIn Poggendorff's _Annalen_ (1841, Erganzsband, 517-19,--Boué, an old\r\noffender in that way, says 1842) there is an account of ice being\r\nfound in the Westerwald, near the village of Frickhofen at the foot of\r\nthe _Dornburg_, among basaltic débris about 500 feet above the\r\nsea.[205] Commencing at a depth of 2 feet below the surface, the ice\r\nreaches from 20 to 22 feet farther down, where the loose stones give\r\nplace to dry sand. The ice is in thin layers on the stones, and is\r\ndeposited in the form of clear and regular hexagonal crystals. The\r\nlateral extent through which this phenomenon obtains is from 40 to 50\r\nfeet each way, and is greater in winter than in summer. As in other\r\ncases that have been noticed in basaltic débris, the snow which falls\r\nupon the surface here is speedily melted. The _Allgemeine Zeitung_\r\n(1840, No. 309), from which the account in Poggendorff is taken,\r\nsuggested that the melted snow-water which would thus run down among\r\nthe interstices would readily freeze below the surface, while the\r\nheavy cold air of winter would be stored up at the lower levels, and\r\nthe poor conducting powers of basaltic rock[206] would favour its\r\npermanence through the summer. The temperature of the cold current\r\nwhich was perceptible in the parts of the mass of débris where the ice\r\nexisted was 1° R. (34°·25 F.). Nothing but a few lichens grow on the\r\nsurface of the débris.\r\n\r\nThese are, I think, all the references I have met with to the prismatic\r\nstructure of subterranean ice. But there is an interesting account in\r\nPoggendorff 's _Annalen_,[207] by a private teacher in Jena, of the\r\ncrystalline appearance of ice under slow thaw near that town. In the\r\nwinter of 1840, the Saale was frozen, and the ice remained unbroken till\r\nthe middle of January, when the thermometer rose suddenly, and the\r\nriver in consequence overflowed the lower grounds, and carried large\r\nmasses of ice on to the fields, where it was left when the water\r\nsubsided. On the 20th of January the thermometer fell again, and\r\nremained below the freezing point till the 12th of February: some of the\r\nice did not disappear till the following month.\r\n\r\nWhen the ice had lain a short time, cracks appeared on the surface\r\nexposed to the sun, and spread like a network from the edges towards the\r\ncentre of the surface. At first there was no regularity in the\r\nconnection of these lines, and the several meshes were of very different\r\nsizes. After a time, the larger meshes split up into smaller, and the\r\nsystem of network was found to penetrate below the surface, the cracks\r\ndeepening into furrows, which descended perpendicularly from the\r\nsurface, and divided the ice into long thin rhomboidal pillars. The\r\nsurface-end of some of these pillars was strongly marked with right\r\nlines parallel to one of the sides of the mesh, and it was found that\r\nthere was a tendency in the ice to split down planes through these lines\r\nand parallel to the corresponding side-plane. Parallel to the original\r\nsurface of the mass of ice, the pillars broke off evenly. The\r\nside-planes had a rounded, wrinkled appearance; and their mutual\r\ninclinations--as far as could be determined--were from 105° to 115°, and\r\nfrom 66° to 75°. When these ice-pillars were examined by means of\r\npolarised light, they were found to possess a feeble double-refracting\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the article in Poggendorff suggests a question which he\r\nwas not sure how to answer:--Is this appearance in correspondence with\r\nthe original formation of the ice, or does it only appear under slow\r\nthaw?\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that from the 1st to the 11th of February the\r\nthermometer was never higher than 22°·8 F., and during that time fell as\r\nlow as 21° below zero, i.e. 43° below the freezing point.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall has informed me that in the winters of 1849, 1850,\r\n1851, he found the banks of a river in Germany loaded with massive\r\nlayers of drift-ice, in a state of thaw, and was struck by the fact that\r\nevery layer displayed the prismatic structure described above, the axes\r\nof the prisms being at right angles to the surfaces of freezing. It may\r\nbe, he adds, that this structure is in the first place determined by the\r\nact of freezing, but it does not develop itself until the ice thaws.\r\n\r\nM. Hassenfratz observed an appearance in ice on the Danube at\r\nVienna[208] corresponding to that described at Jena. He gives no\r\ninformation as to the state of the weather or the temperature at the\r\ntime, nor any of the circumstances under which the ice came under his\r\nnotice. One of the masses of ice which he describes was crystallised in\r\nprisms of various numbers of sides: of these prisms the greater part\r\nwere hexahedral and irregular. Another mass was composed of prisms in\r\nthe form of truncated pyramids; and in another he found quadrilateral\r\nand octahedral prisms, the former splitting parallel to the faces, and\r\nalso truncated pyramids with five and six sides. He adds, that he had\r\nfrequently seen in the upper valleys tufts of ice growing, as it were,\r\nout of the ground, and striated externally, but had never succeeded in\r\ndiscovering any internal organisation, until one evening in a time of\r\nthaw, when he found by means of a microscope that the striated tufts of\r\nice had assumed the same structure on a small scale as that which he had\r\nobserved on the Danube.\r\n\r\nA Frenchman who was present in the room in which the Chemical Section of\r\nthe British Association met at Bath, and heard a paper which I read\r\nthere on this prismatic structure, suggested that it was probably\r\nsomething akin to the rhomboidal form assumed by dried mud; and I have\r\nsince been struck by the great resemblance to it, as far as the surface\r\ngoes, which the pits of mud left by the coprolite-workers near Cambridge\r\noffer, of course on a very large scale. This led me to suppose that the\r\nintense dryness which would naturally be the result of the action of\r\nsome weeks or months of great cold upon subterranean ice might be one of\r\nthe causes of its assuming this form, and the observations at Jena would\r\nrather confirm than contradict this view: competent authorities,\r\nhowever, seem inclined to believe that warmth, and not cold, is the\r\nproducing cause.[209]\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall found, in the course of his experiments on the discs\r\nand flowers produced in the interior of a mass of ice by sending a warm\r\nray through the mass, that the pieces of ice were in some cases\r\ntraversed by hazy surfaces of discontinuity, which divided the\r\napparently continuous mass into irregular prismatic segments. The\r\nintersections of the bounding surfaces of these segments with the\r\nsurface of the slab of ice formed a very irregular network of\r\nlines.[210] I am inclined, however, to think that the irregularity in\r\nthese cases proved to be so much greater than that observed in the\r\nglacières, that this interior prismatic subdivision must be referred to\r\nsome different cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: The continued extrication of latent heat by ice, as it is\r\ncooled a few degrees below 32° F., appears to indicate a molecular\r\nchange subsequent to the first freezing.--_Phil.

The\r\nEnglish version is as follows:--'The snow melted by the heat of the\r\nsummer, other snow being faln within a little while after, and hardened\r\ninto ice, which by little and little in a long tract of time depurating\r\nitself turns into a stone, not yielding in hardness and clearness to\r\nchrystall. Such stones closely joyned and compacted together compose a\r\nwhole mountain, and that a very firm one; though in summer-time the\r\ncountry-people have observed it to burst asunder with great cracking,\r\nthunder-like.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: See the woodcut illustrating Professor Tyndall's remarks\r\nin the 148th volume of the _Philosophical Transactions_ (1858, p. 214).]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nON THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF THE REGIONS IN WHICH THE GLACIÈRES OCCUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany interesting experiments have for long been carried on with a view\r\nto determine the mean temperature at various depths below the surface of\r\nthe earth. The construction of Artesian wells has afforded useful\r\nopportunities for increasing the amount of our knowledge on this\r\nsubject; and the well at Pregny, near Geneva,[211] and the Monk Wearmouth\r\ncoal-mines, as observed by Professor Phillips while a fresh shaft was\r\nbeing sunk,[212] have supplied most valuable facts. Without entering\r\ninto any detail, which would be an unnecessary trouble, it may be stated\r\ngenerally, that, under ordinary circumstances, 1° F. of temperature is\r\ngained for every 50 or 60 feet of vertical descent into the interior of\r\nthe earth. I have only met with one account of an experiment made in a\r\nhorizontal direction, and it is curious that the law of the increase of\r\ntemperature then observed seemed to be very much the same as that\r\ndetermined by the mean of the vertical observations. Boussingault[213]\r\nfound several horizontal adits in a precipitous face of porphyritic\r\nsyenite among the mountains of Marmato. In one of these adits--a gallery\r\ncalled Cruzada, at an elevation of 1,460 mètres--he found an increase\r\nof 1° C. of mean temperature for every 33 mètres of horizontal\r\npenetration, or, approximately, 1° F. for 60 feet.[214]\r\n\r\nAgain, observations have been made, in various latitudes, of the\r\ndecrease of temperature consequent upon gradual rising from the general\r\nsurface of the earth; as, for instance, in the ascent of mountains.\r\nSpeaking without any very great precision, but with sufficient accuracy\r\nfor ordinary purposes, 1° F. is lost with every 300 feet of ascent.[215]\r\nIt is evident that this decrease will be less rapid where the slope of\r\nascent is gradual, from such considerations as the angle at which the\r\nsun's rays strike the slope, and the larger amount of surface which is\r\nin contact with a stratum of atmosphere of any given thickness.\r\n\r\nWith these data, it is easy to arrive at some idea of the probable mean\r\ntemperature of the rock containing several of the glacières I have\r\ndescribed. The elevation of some of them has not been determined with\r\nsufficient accuracy to make the results of any calculation trustworthy;\r\nbut four cases may be taken where the elevation is known--namely, the\r\nGlacières of S. Georges, S. Livres, Monthézy, and the Schafloch. If we\r\ntake as a starting point the mean temperature of the town of Geneva,\r\nwhich has been determined at 49°·55 F., the elevation of that town being\r\nnearly 1,200 feet, we obtain the following approximate results for the\r\nmean temperature of the surface at the points in question:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  S. Georges        ....  40°·22 Fahr.\r\n  S. Livres (Lower) ....  38°·55\"\r\n  Schafloch         ....  33°·88\"\r\n  Monthézy          ....  41°·55\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law of decrease of temperature enunciated by M. Thury gives a higher\r\nmean temperature for the surface of the earth in these places, as in the\r\nfollowing table:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  S. Georges        ....  41°·8 Fahr.\r\n  S. Livres         ....  40°·1\"\r\n  Schafloch         ....  35°·6\"\r\n  Monthézy          ....  42°·5\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any certain information could be obtained of the elevation of the\r\nAbbey of Grâce-Dieu, I am sure that a result more surprising than that\r\nin the case of the Glacière of Monthézy would appear. The elevation of\r\nthe floor of the church in the citadel of Besançon is 367·7 mètres, and\r\nthe plateau on the north side of the town of Baume-les-Dames is 531·9\r\nmètres. I am inclined to think, from the look of the country, that the\r\nlatter possesses much the same elevation as the valley in which the\r\nAbbey lies; and in that case we should have comparatively a very high\r\nmean temperature for the surface in the neighbourhood where the glacière\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\nBut if these are the mean temperatures of the surface, the natural\r\ntemperatures of the caves themselves should be still higher, on account\r\nof the allowance to be made for increase of temperature with descent\r\ninto the interior of the earth. This element will very materially affect\r\nour calculations in such a case as the lower part of the ice in the\r\nGlacière of the Pré de S. Livres, and the strange suggestive beginning\r\nof a new ice-cave 190 feet below the surface, on the Montagne de l'Eau,\r\nnear Annecy. In any open pit or cave, the ordinary atmospheric\r\ninfluences find such easy access, that the temperature cannot be\r\nexpected to follow the law observed when perforations of small bore are\r\nmade in the earth, as in the case of the preliminary boring before\r\ncommencing to dig a well;[216] but the two glacières mentioned above are\r\nso completely protected in their lowest parts, that they may be treated\r\nas if they were isolated from external influence of all ordinary kinds;\r\nand it may fairly be said that the mean temperature there ought to be\r\nconsiderably higher than at the surface.\r\n\r\nIt is not very likely that the results of the above calculations are\r\nstrictly in accordance with what a careful series of observations on the\r\nspot might show. The distance between Geneva and the Glacières of S.\r\nGeorges and S. Livres is sufficiently small to make it probable that the\r\nreality is not very far different from the calculated temperature; but\r\nthe other two caves are comparatively so far off, that the temperature\r\nand elevation of Geneva are not very safe data to build upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: Bischof, _Physical Researches_, 189.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: _Philosophical Magazine_, v. 446 (1834).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: _Annules de Chimie et de Physique_, liii. 2-10.

Thury calculates a decrease of 1° C. for every 174\r\nmètres between Geneva and S. Bernard, which is less than the decrease\r\ngiven in the text. He arrives at this conclusion by correcting the mean\r\ntemperature of Geneva from 8°·9 C., the observed mean of eighteen years,\r\nto 9°·9 C., in consequence of supposed local causes, which unduly\r\ndepress the temperature of Geneva. With the mean 8°·9 C. a result nearly\r\nin accordance with that of the text is obtained.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: Professor Phillips found, in the course of his\r\ninvestigations in the Monk Wearmouth mines, some hundreds of yards below\r\nthe sea, that when a new face of rock was exposed, its temperature was\r\nconsiderably higher than that of the gallery or shaft in which it lay.\r\nIn some cases the difference amounted to 9 and 10 degrees. The rock soon\r\ncooled down to an agreement with the surrounding temperature.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Thury's observations during his winter visit to the Glacière of S.\r\nGeorges are so curious and valuable, that I give the principal results\r\nof them here.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that this glacière consists of a roomy cave, 110\r\nfeet long and 60 feet high, with two orifices in the higher part of the\r\nroof, one of which is kept covered with the trunks of trees to shut out\r\nthe direct radiation of the sun. A little thought suggested to M. Thury\r\nthat the cold in the cave in mid-winter would most probably be greater\r\nthan the external cold of the day, and less than that of the night; so\r\nthat there should be a time in the later evening when a column of colder\r\nand heavier air would begin, to descend through the hole in the roof. To\r\ntest the correctness of this supposition, he took up his abode in the\r\ncavern for the evening of the 10th January, 1858, with a lighted candle.\r\nThe flame burned steadily for some time; but at 7.16 P.M. it began to\r\nflicker, and soon inclined downwards through an angle of about 45°; and\r\nwhen M. Thury placed himself under the principal opening, the flame was\r\nforced into an almost horizontal position. At 8 P.M. the current of air\r\nhad all but disappeared. This violent and temporary disturbance of\r\nequilibrium was a matter of much surprise to M. Thury; for he had\r\nnaturally expected a quiet current downwards, continuing through the\r\ngreater part of the night.\r\n\r\nAt 7.16 P.M. the external temperature was 23·9° F., and the temperature\r\nof the atmosphere in the cave at the same time was 30°·88 F.;[217] so\r\nthat there is no wonder the current of air should be strong. It is very\r\ndifficult to say, however, why it did not commence much earlier,\r\nconsidering that the external air must have been heavier than that in\r\nthe cave long before 7 o'clock. M. Thury refers to the mirage as a\r\nsomewhat similar instance, that phenomenon being explained by the\r\nsupposition that atmospheric layers of different temperatures lie one\r\nabove another in clearly-defined strata. He suggests, also, that as the\r\nheavier air tends to pass down into the cave, the less cold air already\r\nin the cave tends to pass out; and the narrow entrance confining the\r\nstruggle between the opposing tendencies to a very small area, the\r\nweaker initial current is able for a time to hold its own against the\r\nintruder. On this supposition, it is easy to see that when the rupture\r\ndoes occur it will be violent.\r\n\r\nThe next day, M. Thury arrived at the glacière at 9.50 A.M. He had\r\ndetermined, in the summer, that the temperature of the cave was\r\ninvariable, at any rate through the 3-1/2 hours of his visit (from 7.30\r\nto 11 A.M.); but his winter experience was very different. The following\r\nare the results of his observations.\r\n\r\nIn the cave:--\r\n\r\nJanuary 9, at 7.16 P.M.[218]...  30°·884 Fahr.\r\n   \"        \" 7.20 \"        ...  29°·75   \"\r\n   \"        \" 7.27 \"        ...  27°·5    \"\r\n   \"        \" 7.50 \"        ...  26°·834  \"\r\n\r\nJanuary 10, at 10.12 A.M.   ...  23°·684  \"\r\n   \"        \"  10.0 \"       ...  23°·9    \"\r\n   \"        \"  11.20 \"      ...  24°·022  \"\r\n   \"        \"  12.14 P.M.   ...  24°·134  \"\r\n   \"        \"   1.30 \"      ...  24°·35   \"\r\n   \"        \"   2.30 \"      ...  24°·584  \"\r\n   \"        \"   3.14 \"      ...  24°·8    \"\r\n   \"        \"   4.0  \"      ...  25°·142  \"\r\n\r\nSupposing the weather to have been much the same on the 9th and 10th of\r\nJanuary, as M. Thury's account seems to say, there is something very\r\nstrange in the great difference between the temperatures registered at 4\r\nP.M. on the one day, and at 7.16 P.M. on the other.\r\n\r\nThe external temperatures at the mouth of the cave were as follows:--\r\n\r\nJanuary 10, at 10.53 A.M. 25°·934 Fahr.\r\n    \"       \"  11.14  \"   26°·384   \"\r\n    \"       \"  11.45  \"   28°·04    \"\r\n    \"       \"  12.32 P.M. 27°·944   \"\r\n    \"       \"   1.12  \"   30°·644   \"\r\n    \"       \"   3.3   \"   26°·834   \"\r\n    \"       \"   3.56  \"   25°·7     \"\r\n    \"       \"   4.26  \"   25°·25    \"\r\n\r\nThe minimum temperature of the external air during the night of January\r\n10-11 was 18°·392 F., and that of the glacière 19°·76 F.[219] During the\r\npreceding night, the minimum in the cave was 22°·442 F., which may throw\r\nsome light upon the difference between the temperatures at 7.16 P.M. on\r\nthe 9th, and at 4 P.M. on the 10th.\r\n\r\nM. Thury bored a hole, of about 10 inches in depth, in the flooring of\r\nice, and placed a thermometer in it, at 12.25 P.M., closing it up with\r\ncotton. At 2.55 P.M., and at 4.7. P.M., the thermometer marked the same\r\ntemperature, namely, 26°·24 F.\r\n\r\nM. Thury's views on glacières in general, based upon the details of the\r\nthree which he has visited, are much the same as those which I have\r\nexpressed. He has, however, more belief than I in 'cold currents.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: This was given by a thermometer only placed in the cave\r\nat 7 P.M., and by construction not very sensible.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: The moment when the disturbance of the atmosphere\r\ncommenced.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: M. Thury gives--4°·62 C. as the minimum in the glacière\r\nduring the night in question; but on the next page he gives--6°·8 C.\r\n(=19°·76 F.). It is evident, from a comparison with other details of his\r\nobservations, that the latter is the correct account.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *",
