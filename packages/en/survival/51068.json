BRODRICK, PARK NATURALIST_\r\n\r\n“Oh ranger, please! Just one itzy bitzy piece of petrified wood to take\r\nhome to show my boy friend. You won’t miss just one teeny weeny piece.”\r\n\r\nHolding in his hand an assortment of specimens of petrified wood which\r\nhe had just retrieved from the young lady driving the flashy\r\nconvertible, the Highway 260 checking station ranger at Petrified Forest\r\nNational Monument shook his head with a wry smile. “Sorry, lady, but the\r\nrules say ‘It is unlawful to injure, destroy, or remove specimens of\r\npetrified wood of any size whatsoever found within the monument boundary\r\n* * *,’ and my job is to see that this and other regulations are obeyed.\r\nYou’re right, we would never miss these few pieces if you took them home\r\nwith you, but they belong to the people of the United States, and if\r\neveryone of the 350,000 visitors who come here each year took away only\r\na few specimens, as you wish to do, in a very few years there wouldn’t\r\nbe any left. It’s my job, as representative of the people of this\r\ncountry, to see that there will always be this great natural display of\r\npetrified wood here where it was formed.”\r\n\r\nAs the young lady drove off with a gay wave of her hand and “I think\r\nyou’re mean” tossed over her shoulder, the ranger turned to us with a\r\nrueful smile. “Happens every day,” he said. “You can’t blame people for\r\nwanting to take home a souvenir of the Petrified Forest, and the stuff\r\nis so pretty that kids, especially, just can’t help but want to pack it\r\noff. And, with so much of it here, it’s hard for them to understand that\r\nit would soon be gone, particularly along the roads and trails, if\r\neveryone carried off a handful or two.”\r\n\r\nWe agreed with the ranger that it is hard to understand, until it is\r\nexplained that such enormous quantities of petrified wood as are strewn\r\nover hundreds of acres in Petrified Forest National Monument could be\r\nentirely removed in a few years by souvenir-hungry American tourists.\r\n“But where,” we inquired, “do these roadside stands all along Highway 66\r\nget the huge piles of petrified wood which they offer for sale? Surely\r\nthe National Park Service doesn’t permit them to haul it off the\r\nmonument by the truckload.”\r\n\r\n“Oh no,” grinned the ranger. “All of that ‘for-sale’ wood comes from\r\nprivate lands. The national monument preserves and protects only the\r\nlargest and most colorful deposits of petrified wood; but it is found in\r\nmany places throughout northeastern Arizona.”\r\n\r\nThe impatient toot of an automobile horn informed us that we were\r\nblocking traffic, so we thanked the ranger and continued on our way.\r\nHowever, the interesting conversation aroused our curiosity, and at the\r\nfirst opportunity we returned to the Petrified Forest to learn more\r\nabout the occurrence of petrified wood, and how Uncle Sam, through the\r\nNational Park Service, keeps the wood from being carried off by souvenir\r\ncollectors, and how the fascinating story of wood petrification is told\r\nto visitors who take a little time to visit the monument museum at the\r\nRainbow Forest headquarters of the superintendent. This is the way the\r\nnaturalists tell it.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, it was the threat of souvenir hunters and raids on\r\nthe fields of petrified wood by commercial jewelers, gem collectors, and\r\nabrasive manufacturers in the late 1890’s and early 1900’s that led\r\nthoughtful citizens of the then Arizona Territory to petition Congress\r\nfor the establishment of some sort of a protectorate for the Petrified\r\nForest. In the vicinity of the Agate Bridge and what is now known as the\r\nFirst Forest, enterprising abrasive makers set up a stamp mill to\r\npulverize the great blocks of petrified wood which they found there.\r\nHere, also, many of the logs were dynamited in the search for quartz and\r\namethyst crystals which some of them contained.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the petition by citizens of Arizona Territory, and in\r\nresponse to requests by other groups in the Southwest that steps be\r\ntaken to protect great cliff dwellings and other prehistoric Indian\r\nremains which were being systematically pothunted and looted, Congress\r\npassed the Antiquities Act. This authority enabled President Theodore\r\nRoosevelt on December 8, 1906, to issue a proclamation establishing\r\nPetrified Forest National Monument for the protection and preservation\r\nof one of the world’s most colorful and extensive concentrations of\r\npetrified wood “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.”\r\n\r\nNortheastern Arizona is not the only area known to contain petrified\r\nwood, for it has been found in nearly every State and in foreign\r\ncountries as well. Visitors from distant States are frequently surprised\r\nto discover, from a map in the monument’s museum, that petrified wood is\r\nto be found near their own homes. It is, however, the large amount of\r\nthe wood in such beautiful and varied colors that makes _this_ Petrified\r\nForest outstanding and worthy of being protected as an area of national\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nWe do not know for certain which of the early travelers was the first to\r\nsee the great display of petrified wood of northern Arizona. Spanish\r\nexplorers may have seen it during the 1500’s, since they viewed and\r\nnamed the Painted Desert (Desierto Pintado), but no written account has\r\nbeen located that gives any indication that they noticed the wood. In\r\nfact, the earliest written report on record was not made until 1851. In\r\nthat year, Lieutenant Sitgreaves, an Army officer, explored parts of\r\nnorthern Arizona and mentioned the petrified wood in his reports. In\r\n1853, an Army expedition led by Lieutenant Whipple visited the present\r\nmonument area, camping near the Black Forest.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 1880’s that settlement of this part of the Arizona\r\nterritory really got under way with completion of the Santa Fe Railroad\r\nacross it in 1883. Word about the petrified wood spread, and it was not\r\nlong until the destructive activities were started.\r\n\r\nThe six separate “forests” within the monument are areas of the greatest\r\nconcentration of petrified logs and have been named the First, Second,\r\nThird, Black, Rainbow, and Blue Forests. The latter was given its name\r\nbecause of the bluish color of much of the badlands formation in which\r\nthe wood is found. There is not a great deal of difference in the wood\r\nfound in the other locations, so they were apparently named by early\r\nresidents in order to distinguish one location from the other.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this monument is easily accessible since it is crossed by\r\ntwo main highways, thus giving visitors to northern Arizona an excellent\r\nopportunity to enjoy the beauties of this unusual work of nature. The\r\nNational Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior\r\nhas been entrusted with the responsibility of protecting and\r\nadministering this and all of the other national monuments and parks\r\nforming America’s National Park System. It is the responsibility of all\r\nthe people, as owners of these outstanding national values, to help the\r\nService keep the wonders of this and other parks and monuments intact\r\nfor the enjoyment of future generations.\r\n\r\nBecause of the name “Petrified Forest,” many people who have read of it\r\nexpect to find trees “turned to stone” and standing upright just as they\r\ngrew. Actually, geologists who have studied the area very carefully do\r\nnot believe that many of the living trees grew in this particular\r\nlocation, for all of the evidence indicates that fallen timber from\r\nforests a considerable distance away was carried here by flood waters of\r\nancient streams and stranded and buried in the mud and shallows of\r\nlagoons and marshes.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of what geologists call the Triassic period,\r\nabout 160 to 170 million years ago, most of northeastern Arizona was\r\napparently an extensive flood plain; low, flat, and swampy. Numerous\r\nstreams, some of them quite large, flowed out from the surrounding low\r\nhills into the plain. These streams brought enormous quantities of\r\nsediments; mud, sand, and other minerals, spreading it out layer upon\r\nlayer as they shifted their flow back and forth just as on present river\r\ndeltas. These sediments contained huge amounts of volcanic ash which the\r\nstreams apparently picked up near their sources. This ash was largely\r\nsilica, the mineral which was later to be of major importance in the\r\npetrification of the wood. (Silica (SiO₂) is the oxide of silicon, a\r\nnon-metallic element making up 28 per cent of the earth’s crust. The\r\ncrystal form of silica is quartz, the commonest of all minerals, which\r\nis found in large amounts in many volcanic rocks.)\r\n\r\nThe flood plain was broken by an occasional ridge or high spot,\r\napparently tree-covered, as a few petrified stumps with partial root\r\nsystems have been found in the locations where they apparently grew.\r\nHowever, most of the trees grew in forests on the low hills through\r\nwhich these rivers flowed, anywhere from a few miles to 50 or 100 miles\r\nor more to the west and southwest of the present national monument.\r\nThese trees died from various causes, just as trees of our modern times\r\ndo. Fire, wind, insects, diseases, and other causes all took their toll.\r\nMany trees probably decayed in the forest where they fell, but others\r\nwere picked up by flood waters and were eventually transported by the\r\nstreams to the flood plain there to become stranded with hundreds of\r\nothers and to be covered by the sediments brought in by the streams.\r\n\r\nThis transportation theory is based on several types of evidence. In the\r\nfirst place, the logs have been stripped of much of their original roots\r\nand limbs, and practically all of the bark has disappeared. The logs\r\npresent a worn appearance, an indication of having received rough\r\ntreatment. Also, very few traces of cones or foliage have been located,\r\nalthough the fossil remains of more than 30 species of fragile ferns,\r\ncycads, rushes, and other plants that grew in the marshes of the ancient\r\nflood plain have been found. The direction of the original drainage into\r\nthis area has been established by tracing the source of the Permian\r\ngravels which are deposited here.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of these sediments over the plain continued until a layer\r\nabout 400 feet thick was built up during the centuries. This deposit is\r\nnow known geologically as the “Chinle Formation.” One of the principal\r\nmaterials found in the Chinle is Bentonite, originally a volcanic ash\r\nwhich the streams brought. It has since decomposed into a clay-like soil\r\nwhich is very porous and spongy and which readily absorbs water and\r\nexpands. When becoming very wet, it turns into a bluish mud and is\r\nwashed away. Erosion of this Bentonite and other materials deposited\r\nwith it forms the badlands area now seen on portions of the monument and\r\nin the Painted Desert. During the ages when the original layers of mud,\r\nsand, and silt were being deposited, many of the logs were washed in and\r\nburied at various levels with this Chinle material.\r\n\r\nWhile all of this was slowly taking place, the land mass over this part\r\nof the continent was gradually subsiding. It continued to settle during\r\nthe next geological period of millions of years, and layer after layer\r\nof sediments were washed in and deposited on top of it. Then during the\r\nnext geological (Cretaceous) period, a long arm of a sea flooded this\r\npart of the country. Marine deposits accumulated on the bottom of the\r\nsea until finally the Chinle Formation containing the buried logs was\r\ncovered by 3,000 feet or more of other deposits.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Cretaceous time, about 60 million years ago, uplift of\r\nthe present Rocky Mountain system commenced. The basin in which the\r\nPetrified Forest lay buried rose with it. This gradual rising movement\r\nhas continued intermittently nearly to the present time.\r\n\r\nThis uplift brought with it the activity of erosion which has continued\r\nthrough the ages until finally almost all of the 3,000 feet of upper\r\nlayers of material have been washed away, and the many logs, that had\r\nonce been so deeply buried, have again been exposed on the surface; but\r\nnow as hard, colorful stone. Erosion continued to carry the soil away\r\nfrom the petrified logs, exposing more and more of them. As forces of\r\nerosion lowered the surface of the ground little by little, the\r\npetrified logs, too hard to be affected, settled with it, eventually\r\naccumulating with sections of other logs that had been buried on a lower\r\nlevel. Thus, the present surface of the ground is rather thickly\r\ncovered, in many spots, with wood that was originally scattered through\r\napproximately the upper 100 feet of this Chinle Formation. In the\r\nvicinity of the Rainbow and Third Forest, at least, about 300 feet more\r\nof this formation still remains. So far as we know, wood is to be found\r\nthroughout this entire layer. Therefore, theoretically at least, it may\r\nbe said that 25 per cent of the petrified wood that is here is visible\r\non the surface, the rest still remaining buried below.\r\n\r\nThree species of trees have been found here in petrified form. The most\r\ncommon one is an Araucarian Pine (_Araucarioxylon Arizonicum_), a\r\nprimitive member of the pine family. This species became extinct long\r\nago, but there are still several species of modern Araucaria native to\r\nSouth America, Australia, New Zealand, and other South Pacific islands\r\nwhich are apparently very similar to this ancient form. Some of the\r\nmodern types have been imported to this country and are used for\r\nornamental purposes in certain locations in Florida and along the\r\nPacific coast. The most common ones are known as the “Monkey Puzzle\r\nTree” and “Norfolk Island Pine.” Claims made by roadside stand operators\r\nalong Highway 66 that the petrified wood offered for sale is “beach\r\nwalnut,” “cactus,” etc., have no basis in fact.\r\n\r\nTwo other types of petrified wood are found here in smaller amounts.\r\nThese are the _Woodworthia Arizonica_, a cone-bearing tree somewhat\r\nsimilar to the Araucaria and the _Schilderia Adamanica_, a tree with\r\npeculiar radiating rays in the wood. Paleontologists are not sure where\r\nthis latter kind belongs in systematic plant classification. What\r\nhappened during the millenniums that the logs lay buried in their Chinle\r\ntombs?\r\n\r\nHow did these trees turn to stone? Most of our text books tell us that\r\nthe petrification of wood is a replacement process. Bit by bit, water\r\nremoved wood tissue and in its place left a mineral deposit in exactly\r\nthe same form as the original, so that when the process had been\r\ncompleted there was no wood left but in its place an exact stone\r\nduplicate. This theory was accepted for a very long time, but recently\r\nsome scientists were not satisfied with it because certain chemical\r\nactions that would have to occur during such a process were difficult to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nJust prior to 1940, several scientists investigated the process, and\r\nfrom their findings decided that the wood was not petrified by\r\n_replacement_ but by the _infiltration_ of mineral-bearing water into\r\nthe wood and the deposition of this mineral in the air spaces within the\r\nwood tissue. This process, they believe, continued until all of the\r\nmicroscopic spaces in the wood were filled solid with this deposit and\r\nthe petrified log, composed of 98 per cent by volume of mineral deposit\r\nand 2 per cent cellulose and lignin wood tissue, was the result. The\r\noriginal wood tissue acted, they think, as a framework to hold the\r\nmineral deposit like the walls of a building would act if the rooms and\r\nspaces between the walls were filled in solid with liquid concrete. This\r\naccounts for retention of the cell structure, annual rings, and other\r\nfeatures of the original wood. The petrification of wood has never been\r\nstudied sufficiently, and there are many questions for which\r\nsatisfactory answers have not yet been advanced.\r\n\r\nAlthough woods in different localities have been petrified by other\r\nminerals, the most common is silica. In the case of this petrified wood,\r\nthe silica was deposited in an agatized non-crystalline form. The normal\r\ncolor of the silica without mineral stain is a white or gray. Sometimes\r\nsmall amounts of other minerals were in the solution along with silica,\r\nor in some cases were brought in during the millions of years of burial\r\nas a secondary deposit in the cracks, checks, or other openings in the\r\npetrified or partially petrified wood. Iron oxides in small quantities\r\nproduced the great variety of shades of red, brown, and yellow. The\r\nblack color in most cases is due to manganese oxide or carbon. Thus, the\r\ncombination of minerals produced a rainbow of colors in the agatized\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nWhenever there were small checked places, cracks, or hollows in the\r\nwood, we find that they are often either filled or lined with quartz\r\ncrystals or occasionally with amethyst crystals.\r\n\r\nThe term “chalcedony” (pronounced kal-sed´-nee) is a broad one usually\r\napplied to any compact mass of silica free of definite color pattern,\r\nbut it is also frequently used to describe all forms of silica whether\r\ntranslucent or opaque, and regardless of color. Agate, therefore, may be\r\nconsidered a variegated chalcedony. Agate is translucent and has a\r\ndefinite color or pattern. Jasper is opaque and may be either red,\r\nbrown, yellow, blue, or green in color. Quartz minerals are harder than\r\nmost types of steel, and there are only about 30 other minerals that\r\nexceed it in hardness. In the mineral scale of hardness, quartz is rated\r\nat 7 and diamond, the hardest of all, at 10. Petrified wood weighs about\r\n166 pounds per cubic foot.\r\n\r\n“Who sawed these trees” is one of the questions visitors frequently ask.\r\nIt is a natural query because most of the logs are cracked into\r\nsections, in many instances of rather uniform length, and each broken\r\nface is smooth enough to appear almost like a saw cut. At first glance\r\nthis does give the impression that someone, possibly a Paul Bunyan with\r\nan enormous diamond-toothed saw, had cut the logs into “stove wood”\r\nlengths. Although there may be some differences of opinion about how\r\nthis fracturing occurred, the present explanation by scientists is that\r\nmost of this breakage took place during the period of uplift of this\r\nsection of the country. The gradual movement and elevation of the\r\nearth’s crust caused numerous earthquakes. The shock waves of the\r\ntremblor traveling through the earth set up vibrations which caused the\r\ndeeply buried, brittle, petrified logs to crack. The harmonic vibrations\r\ncreated by the rhythm of the regular shock waves caused the cracks to be\r\nrather regularly spaced. At first these cracks were tiny, but centuries\r\nlater, after the logs were exposed on the surface, the weathering\r\nactions and the shifting and settling of the soil beneath them caused\r\nthe cracks to widen and eventually the fractured sections separated.\r\nOccasionally breakage may also occur when soil washes out from under one\r\nend of a log and its weight causes it to sag and crack. The normal\r\nfracture line of this material is at right angles to the lineal axis,\r\nand the rather smooth face causes the broken surface to appear much like\r\na saw cut.\r\n\r\nPolished wood sections that are exhibited in the Rainbow Forest Museum\r\nshow to best advantage the varied color pattern of this petrified wood.\r\nThe piece is first cut with either a diamond or carborundum saw. Then\r\nthe sawed face is ground as smooth as possible on carborundum wheels of\r\ndifferent grits. When ground sufficiently smooth, the final polish is\r\ngiven the surface with hard felt buffing wheels and a polishing\r\ncompound. Due to the hardness of the petrified wood, it takes about an\r\nhour to cut and polish a square inch, hence is an expensive process.\r\nSome of the most colorful or “picture wood” specimens make very\r\nattractive and durable settings for rings, pins, and other jewelry.\r\n\r\nFossil remains of many forms of animal life that existed here during\r\nTriassic times also are found in the Chinle deposits with the petrified\r\nwood. Some parts of skeletons were mineralized and preserved in much the\r\nsame manner as was the wood. The animals which lived where the trees\r\naccumulated were forms that normally inhabited muddy, marshy river\r\nbottoms, another indication of the type of environment here during that\r\nlong-gone age.\r\n\r\nLargest of these animals was the Phytosaur, a crocodile-like reptile\r\nabout 18 feet long and weighing nearly a ton. Nostrils were located on\r\ntop of the head. These reptiles were omnivorous feeders, and with their\r\nwebbed feet and long flattened tails were at home either on land or in\r\nthe water. The Phytosaur was a distant relative of the Dinosaur but\r\nbecame extinct before the Dinosaur reached its peak of development.\r\n\r\nAnother inhabitant of the swampy lowlands where ancient logs were\r\nstranded was the Stegocephalian, a primitive amphibian related to modern\r\nsalamanders, or mud puppies, but of huge size. They were heavy,\r\nflattened creatures from six to nine feet long and probably weighed\r\nabout 500 to 600 pounds. Their legs were very short, and they moved\r\nabout by dragging themselves over the swampy ground, probably being\r\ncarnivorous feeders. The skull was almost completely solid and had\r\nopenings only for the nostrils, eyes, and a peculiar third eye in the\r\ntop which probably was capable of distinguishing movement or light, but\r\nnot color.\r\n\r\nSeveral types of fishes, amphibians, and small reptiles probably lived\r\nalong the streams and in the quiet pools of those ancient marshes. Among\r\nthem were lung-fishes whose teeth or “dental plates” are now found\r\nscattered through the badlands of the Petrified Forest.\r\n\r\nLarge rushes, or horsetails, bordered the streams and matted the swamps.\r\nTheir hollow stems grew to eight and ten inches in diameter and 30 to 40\r\nfeet tall. At each joint were whorls of slender branches. Large,\r\nbroad-leaved ferns formed a striking contrast with the delicate foliage\r\nof the seed fern types. Club mosses probably grew in small clusters in\r\nsheltered places along the banks of the streams and pools.\r\n\r\nHow different this scene of millions of years ago was from our\r\npresent-day landscape and modern plant and animal life. The climate must\r\nhave been at least sub-tropical then; today it is semi-arid.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the plants and animals of those Triassic times living in\r\nswamps and marshes, we now have plants and animals that are able to\r\nexist with a minimum of moisture. The present ground-cover is seldom\r\nover three or four feet high, but includes a wide variety of plants\r\nranging from very small flowering herbs to the several species of\r\ngray-foliaged salt brush and other shrubs. With suitable moisture, the\r\nspring and fall wildflower displays are often very showy. The early\r\nblooms of the chimaya, phacelia, and the large, white, evening primroses\r\nare soon followed by desert mallow; vetch; a small white daisy-like\r\nFleabane; the large yellow tulip-like flowers of the mariposa or sego\r\nlily; and as the season advances, the paint brush; asters; snake weed;\r\ngolden aster; rabbit brush; and many others.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the sluggish reptiles and amphibians in the Triassic, we\r\nnow have the fleet pronghorn (American Antelope); occasional coyotes and\r\nbobcats, porcupine, prairie dogs, rabbits, and many of the smaller\r\nrodents. Several species of harmless snakes and an occasional\r\nrattlesnake; slender, striped, long-tailed race runner lizards; scaled\r\nlizards, and the bright, green-backed, yellow-footed Bailey Collared\r\nLizard which frequently brings visitors hurrying in to inquire if it is\r\npoisonous. It isn’t!\r\n\r\nSeveral species of birds such as the Desert Horned Larks and rock wrens\r\nmake this their permanent home while many other species ranging in size\r\nfrom the tiny Allan Hummingbird to the mighty golden eagle either stay\r\nhere during various parts of the year, or pass through in the spring and\r\nfall migrations.\r\n\r\nIntermixed with the surface deposits of petrified wood and other\r\nremnants of the ancient Triassic time are the much more recent remains\r\nof early men. Ruins of their homes, fragments of their handiwork, and\r\nexamples of their arts are to be found in many locations.\r\n\r\nThese people were pre-Columbian Pueblo Indians, ancestors of our modern\r\nPueblo Indians, and of the same type that inhabited the other pueblo and\r\ncliff-dwelling sites in the Southwest. It is probable that there was\r\nconsiderable trading carried on between the people of this area and\r\nthose at other locations, since many of the same pottery types are found\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat desolate region was apparently fairly densely populated by\r\nlittle groups of farming Indians. With no survey or study of the\r\nmonument area having been made, more than 300 ruin sites have been\r\nlocated and there are many others nearby. These ruins of stone buildings\r\nare usually from one to a few rooms in size. However, one ruin near the\r\nPuerco River Ranger Station is estimated to have had about 125 or more\r\nrooms. It is built in the form of a hollow square about 180 feet by 230\r\nfeet, around a plaza about 130 by 185 feet. Probably two stories in\r\nheight, it could have housed nearly a hundred families.\r\n\r\nA study of the pottery fragments from each site helps us to tell the\r\napproximate time that the particular site was occupied. This time varies\r\nfrom about 500 or 600 A.D. to 1400 A.D., some being used over a longer\r\nperiod than others.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the buildings were constructed of pieces of sandstone,\r\nbut in a few instances the Indians had an eye for color and used pieces\r\nof petrified wood which made a very substantial as well as colorful\r\nbuilding. “Agate House” in the south part of the Third Forest is one\r\nexample of such construction. This was partially reconstructed in 1934\r\nin the early Pueblo style by the use of chunks of petrified wood from\r\nthe heap of the ruins. Indians also used the petrified wood for making\r\narrow-points and other tools and weapons.\r\n\r\nThese people practiced agriculture, cultivating corn, pumpkins, and\r\nbeans. They probably wore simple clothing made of cotton cloth or the\r\nskins of wild animals. They also made pottery.\r\n\r\nTree-ring studies show that there was a great drought from 1275 to 1299\r\nA.D. This apparently caused a great deal of shifting around among the\r\nPueblo people. Only a few villages in the Petrified Forest area were\r\noccupied during the fourteenth century. It is not known whether the\r\npeople were driven out by the predatory Apaches or because of the\r\ndrought.\r\n\r\nWhere did these Indians get water? While there probably has not been any\r\nmarked change in climate or rainfall since that time, there may have\r\nbeen more springs and seeps along the cliffs. It is possible that these\r\nfailed during that great drought period.\r\n\r\nPottery designs of these early Indians show an artistic talent, further\r\nindicated by the many petroglyphs on the sandstone cliffs and boulders\r\nthroughout the area. A petroglyph is a picture or design carved or\r\npecked in the face of a rock. These pictures are of figures, geometric\r\npatterns, and symbols in many cases similar to those found on the\r\npottery. Some represent hands, feet, human figures and shapes of\r\nmammals, birds, or lizards. These appear to be simply a collection of\r\ndrawings made by various Indians over a period of time. In some cases,\r\nthey were clan symbols, each passerby adding his own much like a\r\nvisitor’s register such as we have today or a collection of initials or\r\nnames unthinking people carve on trees or scratch on rocks.\r\nUnfortunately an occasional person nowadays, thoughtless of those that\r\nfollow, either destroys this ancient art work or defaces it by adding\r\nhis name or initials to those of an earlier man. “Newspaper Rock” is the\r\nmost spectacular group of petroglyphs found on the monument.\r\n\r\nHomes and tribal lands of modern Indians are located in areas to the\r\nsouth, east, and north of Petrified Forest National Monument—homes that\r\nwere established in some cases before the first Spanish explorer entered\r\nthe Southwest.\r\n\r\nTo the south in the White Mountains are the Apaches. Apparently both the\r\nApache and the Navajo entered the Southwest only a short time before the\r\nSpaniards came. Being nomads and predatory in nature, they soon struck\r\nterror in the hearts of the peaceful Pueblo people and caused many of\r\nthem to abandon their homes to seek more secluded and protected sites.\r\n\r\nTo the east are the Zuni, a Pueblo people that some of the early\r\noccupants of the Petrified Forest may have joined. When the Spaniards\r\ncame, these Zuni were living in seven pueblos that became known as the\r\nhistoric “Seven Cities of Cibola.”\r\n\r\nTo the north are the Navajo and Hopi peoples. Arizona’s famous Painted\r\nDesert forms a long curving border to the Navajo Reservation—a border\r\nextending from near the New Mexico line westward to the Colorado River\r\nnorthwest of Cameron. A spectacular portion of it lies in the northern\r\npart of Petrified Forest National Monument.\r\n\r\nThe Painted Desert is a colorful, often fantastically eroded badlands of\r\nBentonitic beds stained with shades of red, orange, yellow, blue,\r\npurple, and brown by iron minerals. Arid or semi-arid with only a sparse\r\nvegetative cover, these soft beds are subject to rapid erosion during\r\nArizona’s season of torrential rains.\r\n\r\nThe Painted Desert formed a barrier behind which the early Hopi people\r\nwithdrew to establish their famed mesa-top villages, including Oraibi\r\nwhich has been continuously occupied since about 350 years before the\r\ndiscovery of America. These people still live in their several mesa-top\r\nvillages, their reservation surrounded by that of the Navajo, their\r\nformer enemies, who now lead a peaceful, semi-nomadic life.\r\n\r\nThere is much more to the fascinating story of the Petrified Forest as\r\ntold to us by naturalists of the national monument. Few visitors take\r\ntime from their mad rush to “get somewhere quickly” to make the effort\r\nto understand the intricate and devious ways of Nature, of which “Time\r\nis the essence,” resulting in the spectacular and brilliant display,\r\nthis glittering jewel of the desert, the Petrified Forest. Stopping only\r\nlong enough to marvel briefly, many of them feel the urge to take\r\nsomething with them, some concrete reminder of the colorful scene, some\r\nbits of petrified wood. Those who successfully “get past” the checking\r\nstation ranger with their illicit souvenirs usually lose these trinkets,\r\nor find them turned to sharp goads which prod their consciences in later\r\nyears. How fortunate those visitors who, at the expense of an hour or so\r\nof time, gain an understanding of what lies behind the scenery at the\r\nPetrified Forest, thereby developing an appreciation of the work of\r\nNature and of God as exemplified here. These people take with them, not\r\nmerely a souvenir, but an experience which they will treasure and enjoy\r\nthroughout the remainder of their lives.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Painted Desert from the Monument’s rim drive.\r\n    _Photo by Josef Muench._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A typical scene in Petrified Forest. _National Park\r\n    Service Photo._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Painted Desert from the Painted Desert Inn. _Photo by\r\n    Josef Muench._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Navajo National Monument.
