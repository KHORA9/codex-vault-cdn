The character\r\nof the constituent materials, the proportions in which they are used,\r\nthe consistency, the method of mixing, and the placing and curing of the\r\nconcrete are important factors in securing the desired qualities of the\r\nfinished product.\r\n\r\nTotal failure or a product which does not give the service expected\r\nis often the result of the nonobservance of practices recognized as\r\nnecessary in the preparation and use of concrete. This bulletin is\r\nintended to assist the inexperienced in making and using concrete\r\nsuitable for general farm construction and is confined to a discussion of\r\nthe rudiments of plain (not reinforced) concrete work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEMENT.\r\n\r\nPortland cement is used because it is the only kind adapted to general\r\nconstruction. Other cements are manufactured but they possess individual\r\ncharacteristics that restrict their use. The word Portland is not a trade\r\nname, but signifies the kind and distinguishes it from the slag, natural,\r\nand other cements.\r\n\r\nA number of brands of Portland cement are manufactured, most of which\r\nare made to meet the requirements of a fixed standard adopted by the\r\nUnited States Government and the American Society for Testing Materials.\r\nCement always should be tested for use in important work, but this is\r\nimpractical for the user of small amounts and it is generally safe\r\npractice to omit the test if a reliable brand of Portland cement\r\nof American manufacture is selected, especially if the dealer's or\r\nmanufacturer's guaranty that it meets the standard is secured.\r\n\r\nThe following simple test for soundness is easily made and is on the side\r\nof caution. Make a ball, about 1-1/2 inches in diameter, if neat cement\r\nand water; place it under a wet cloth and keep it moist for 24 hours,\r\nthen put the ball in a vessel of water; allow the water to come to the\r\nboiling point slowly and to boil for 3 hours. A good cement will not be\r\naffected, but an inferior one will check, crack, or go to pieces entirely.\r\n\r\nPortland cement is shipped in paper bags, cloth sacks, and wooden barrels\r\n(sometimes in bulk). For the average user the cloth sack is the best\r\ncontainer, as it is easier to handle; and while the manufacturers charge\r\nmore for this kind of package, they allow a rebate for the return of the\r\nsacks in good condition. A sack of Portland cement weighs 94 pounds and a\r\nbarrel contains the equivalent of four sacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORING.\r\n\r\nAs cement readily absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, it should be\r\nstored in a dry place; if exposed to dampness it soon becomes lumpy, or\r\neven a solid mass, and in this condition it is useless and should be\r\nthrown away. The lumps caused by pressure in piling the sacks are not\r\ninjurious. They can be pulverized easily, thus distinguishing them from\r\nthose due to dampness.\r\n\r\nCement never should be stored on the ground. Build a raised platform for\r\nit and keep it away from the sides of the shelter. As it is heavy, care\r\nshould be taken not to overload the supporting floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINE AGGREGATE (SAND).\r\n\r\nAll grains, small pebbles, or particles of broken stone are considered as\r\nsand if they will pass through a wire screen with one-fourth inch meshes.\r\nThe particles or grains should be hard and well graded and should vary in\r\nsize, as a stronger concrete is thus obtained than when the size of the\r\ngrains is nearly uniform. If a large proportion of the sand is very fine\r\nan extra quantity of cement should be used and if exceptionally fine it\r\nis advisable to use 25 per cent more cement.\r\n\r\nThe sand should be clean; that is, free from vegetable matter, loam, or\r\nany considerable amount of clay. If the hands are soiled when a small\r\nquantity of sand is rubbed between them the following test should be\r\nmade: Put 4 inches of sand into a pint preserving jar, fill with clear\r\nwater to within an inch of the top, fasten the lid, and shake the jar\r\nvigorously until the whole is thoroughly mixed. Set the jar aside and\r\nallow the contents to settle. The sand will settle to the bottom with the\r\nclay and loam on top of it. If more than three-eighths of an inch of clay\r\nor loam shows, the sand should be rejected or washed. The difference in\r\nfineness and color shows clearly the line of division between the clay or\r\nloam and the sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Sand and gravel washing trough.]\r\n\r\nShould sand require washing the simplest way for small quantities is to\r\nbuild a loose board platform from 10 to 15 feet long, with one end higher\r\nthan the other. On the lower end and sides nail 2 by 6 inch boards.\r\nSpread the sand over the platform in a layer 3 or 4 inches thick and\r\nwash with water. The water may be supplied by any means which will cause\r\nagitation of the sand and allow the lighter material to run off with the\r\nwater. When pressure or a head is obtainable the water is most easily\r\napplied by means of a garden hose. The washing should be started at the\r\nhigher end and the water allowed to run through the sand and over the 2\r\nby 6 inch piece at the bottom. Figure 1 illustrates a convenient trough\r\nfor washing larger quantities.\r\n\r\nA small amount of clay, provided it is not in lumps, does not injure\r\nsand, but amounts over 10 per cent should be washed out.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOARSE AGGREGATE (STONE, GRAVEL, ETC.).\r\n\r\nThe larger particles used in concrete may be gravel, broken stone,\r\nair-cooled blast-furnace slag, or other suitable materials. The coarse\r\naggregate should be sound and clean, that is, free from disintegrated or\r\nsoft particles, loam, clay, or vegetable matter. Air-cooled blast-furnace\r\nslag should weigh at least 70 pounds per cubic foot. The best results\r\nare obtained from a mixture of sizes graded from those retained on\r\na one-fourth inch screen to those passing a three-fourths to 2 inch\r\nring, depending upon the work. Ordinarily the greatest dimension of any\r\nparticle should not be over one-fourth of the thickness of the concrete\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVEL.\r\n\r\nGravel which is too dirty for use usually can be detected by observation.\r\nIt may be washed in the same manner as sand. Lumps of clay should be\r\neliminated and care should be taken to see that the gravel is not coated\r\nwith a film of clay or loam which will prevent the bonding of the cement.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROKEN STONE.\r\n\r\nBroken stone should be clean, hard, and of a size suited to the character\r\nof the work, and the same care in grading should be exercised as in the\r\ncase of gravel. Trap, granite, hard limestone, and hard sandstone are\r\ncommonly used. The composition and physical character of the stones\r\nshould be considered, as some possess qualities that limit their use\r\nunder certain conditions (see Substitutes for gravel).\r\n\r\nField stones are common in many localities and their use, when crushed,\r\nmay be economical. The finer particles, after the dust is removed, can be\r\nused as sand. Small stone crushers, operated by three or four horsepower\r\ngasoline engines, can be purchased at a relatively low price and may\r\nprove profitable if a large quantity of stone is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANK-RUN GRAVEL.\r\n\r\nBank or creek gravel, which will answer the purpose of sand and gravel\r\ncombined, sometimes can be obtained, and frequently it is used in small\r\njobs of concrete work just as it comes from the pit or creek. Although\r\nsuch gravel occasionally contains nearly the right proportions of sand\r\nand gravel, in the majority of sand pits and gravel banks there is a\r\ngreat variation in the sizes of the grains and pebbles or gravel and\r\nin the relative quantity of each. It is advisable to screen the sand\r\nand gravel and to remix them in the correct proportions, as well-graded\r\naggregates make stronger concrete and, ordinarily, enough cement will be\r\nsaved to pay for the cost of screening.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that it is advisable to screen bank gravel twice;\r\nfirst over a screen with large meshes to eliminate particles too large\r\nfor use. The size of the mesh will depend upon the nature of the work\r\ninvolved (see Coarse aggregate); then the material which has passed\r\nthrough this screen should be sifted again over a screen with one-fourth\r\ninch meshes. All material which passes the latter screen may be\r\nconsidered sand and should conform to the characteristics discussed under\r\n\"Fine aggregate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSTITUTES FOR GRAVEL OR STONE.\r\n\r\nFor general work gravel or broken stone always is preferred to other\r\ncoarse aggregate. Other materials at times are easier to obtain and, when\r\nused with discretion, will provide a satisfactory concrete.\r\n\r\nBroken terra cotta, brick, and old concrete, if hard and strong, may\r\nbe used for unimportant work where no great strength is required, but\r\nspecial care should be taken that the particles do not show on the\r\nfinished surface.\r\n\r\nThe maxim that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link applies\r\nto concrete. If the coarse aggregate is weaker than the cement mortar,\r\nas in the case of some sandstones, it should be used with caution.\r\nThe aggregate may have properties that render it unsuitable for use\r\nunder certain conditions; for instance, cinders should not be used\r\nif water-tightness or strength is expected, but they are useful for\r\nfireproofing. Material that disintegrates or flakes when heated is\r\nundesirable in places exposed to high temperature; thus marble and some\r\nlimestones should not be used in fireplaces. Some aggregates when exposed\r\nat the surface of concrete are apt to cause discolorations, and when this\r\nwould be objectionable aggregates of this type should be avoided. Flat\r\nor elongated slab-like fragments should be avoided, as particles of this\r\nshape do not bond well; slate and shale are examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nCINDERS.\r\n\r\nCinders should be composed of hard, clean, vitreous clinkers, free from\r\nsulphides, soot, and unburned coal or ashes. As a precaution against the\r\npresence of small amounts of detrimental substances, cinders should be\r\nsoaked thoroughly with water 24 hours before being used. If clean they\r\nwill not discolor the hands when a small quantity is rubbed between the\r\npalms.\r\n\r\nCinder concrete, on account of its light weight, commonly is used for\r\nfilling between sleepers of floors and grading roofs, and frequently for\r\nfireproofing, for which it is very effective. Cinders should never be\r\nused when the concrete is to be subjected to heavy loads or abrasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAVA ROCK.\r\n\r\nLava rock varies widely in chemical composition and physical qualities.\r\nIn some instances lavas are so light and frothy or contain so large a\r\nproportion of easily oxidizable material that they are wholly unsuited\r\nfor concrete work. In general, the lava rock found in the Northwestern\r\nStates is a suitable substitute for gravel. Rhyolite, a light colored\r\nvolcanic rock, and many of the darker colored basaltic lavas can well be\r\nused for concrete for building purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\nWater should be clean and free from strong acid and alkali. Sea or\r\nbrackish water should not be used if fresh water can be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPORTIONING THE MATERIALS.\r\n\r\nIn mixing concrete various proportions of cement, sand, gravel, and water\r\nare employed, depending upon the purpose for which the concrete is to be\r\nused. The ideal mixture is one in which all the spaces or voids between\r\nthe grains of sand are filled with the cement and all the voids in the\r\ngravel are filled with the cement-sand mortar. This perfection is seldom\r\nattained, because the voids in each lot of gravel and sand vary slightly,\r\nand in order to be absolutely safe a little more sand and cement than\r\nwill just fill the voids are used.\r\n\r\nThe strongest concrete is not required in every structure, and, in\r\nmany instances, the cost of it would be unwarranted. For important\r\nwork involving large quantities of materials of unknown qualities,\r\ntests should be made to determine the best proportions. Such tests,\r\nbeing rather complicated, are made usually in a laboratory, and are\r\nnot practical for the user of small quantities of concrete. Various\r\nproportions have been tested by experienced engineers to determine which,\r\nunder average conditions, will develop the greatest strength, best\r\nresist wear, and assure greatest impermeability or water-tightness. The\r\nmixtures given below have been found to meet the requirements indicated,\r\nand having been adopted as arbitrary standards, are recommended for use\r\nin farm concrete work. The amount of water required is discussed under\r\n\"Consistency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nARBITRARY MIXTURES.\r\n\r\n=Rich mixture.=--Used for concrete subject to high stresses or where\r\nexceptional water-tightness and resistance to abrasion are desired:\r\n1:1-1/2:3; i. e., 1 part cement, 1-1/2 parts sand, and 3 parts gravel.\r\n\r\n=Standard mixture.=--Used generally for reinforced concrete and\r\nwater-tight work: 1:2:4; i. e., 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, and 4 parts\r\ngravel.\r\n\r\n=Medium mixture.=--Used for plain concrete of moderate strength: 1:3:5;\r\ni. e., 1 part cement, 3 parts sand, and 5 parts gravel.\r\n\r\nLeaner mixtures are sometimes used after a test has proved them to be\r\nsuitable for the work at hand.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that always in indicating the proportions the first\r\nnumber refers to the cement, the second to the sand, and the third to the\r\ngravel. The three materials must be measured by volume, using the same\r\nunit. The cubic foot is a convenient measure, because a sack of cement,\r\nweighing 94 pounds, is considered to contain 1 cubic foot.\r\n\r\nWhen the coarse aggregate (gravel, etc.) is omitted the mixture is\r\ngenerally spoken of as mortar and the proportions are indicated thus,\r\n1:2, meaning 1 part cement and 2 parts sand. Mortar is used for\r\nplastering, stucco, top coats of floors, and for laying masonry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITIES OF MATERIALS REQUIRED.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore concrete can be made from given volumes of aggregates if the gravel\r\nused is graded from fine to coarse than if the particles are too nearly\r\nof one size, because the small stones help to fill the voids between the\r\nlarger ones and less sand-cement mortar is required. The extra mortar\r\nthus adds to the volume of the concrete.\r\n\r\nA common mistake to be guarded against is to assume that the volume\r\nof concrete produced is equal to the quantity of sand plus the gravel\r\nas indicated in the proportion. For instance a 1:2:4 mixture will not\r\nproduce 6 cubic yards of concrete, if 2 yards of sand and 4 yards of\r\ngravel are used, because the sand will lodge in the voids between the\r\npebbles. If 6 cubic yards of concrete are desired it will be necessary to\r\nuse 2.7 cubic yards of sand and 5.34 cubic yards of gravel.\r\n\r\nTable 1 shows the quantity of cement, sand, and gravel required under\r\naverage conditions for the indicated proportions.\r\n\r\nTable 1.--_Materials for 1 cubic yard of rammed concrete._\r\n\r\n        Proportions.      |          |          |\r\n                          |          |          |\r\n  Cement.| Sand. | Gravel.|  Cement. |   Sand.  |  Gravel.\r\n  -------+-------+--------+----------+----------+-----------\r\n         |       |        | _Sacks._ |_Cu. yds._| _Cu. yds._\r\n     1   |  1    |   ---  |  19.20   |   0.74   |    ---\r\n     1   |  2    |   ---  |  13.48   |   1.00   |    ---\r\n     1   |  2-1/2|   ---  |  11.00   |   1.01   |    ---\r\n     1   |  3    |   ---  |  10.40   |   1.16   |    ---\r\n     1   |  1    |     2  |  10.52   |    .39   |    0.78\r\n     1   |  1-1/2|     3  |   7.64   |    .42   |     .85\r\n     1   |  2    |     4  |   6.04   |    .45   |     .89\r\n     1   |  2-1/2|     5  |   4.96   |    .46   |     .92\r\n     1   |  3    |     5  |   4.64   |    .52   |     .86\r\n     1   |  3    |     6  |   4.24   |    .47   |     .94\r\n  -------+-------+--------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSISTENCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water used in mixing has a very great influence on the\r\nstrength of the concrete. An excess of water weakens the concrete, while\r\nan insufficient amount prevents thorough mixing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--The result of using too dry a mixture, lack\r\nof spading and careless placing; note irregularity of layers and poor\r\nbonding.]\r\n\r\nTherefore, only sufficient water should be used to produce a workable or\r\nplastic mixture.\r\n\r\nRecent tests have proved that to secure the greatest strength the\r\nconcrete should be mixed considerably drier than has heretofore\r\nbeen customary. Of course, for thin walls containing closely placed\r\nreinforcement, or for water-tightness, a fairly wet mix is necessary. A\r\nlittle experience will show the proper amount of water to use.\r\n\r\nA very rough estimate of the quantity of water required in mixing for\r\ngeneral work is 4 to 5 gallons to each sack of cement.\r\n\r\nThree degrees of consistency (corresponding to different proportions\r\nof water) are used in general practice, namely, wet, medium, and dry.\r\nIn the light of recent investigations it is thought the wet mixture of\r\npresent-day practice contains too much water. The following definitions\r\nare therefore recommended:\r\n\r\n=Wet mixture.= One that does not flow readily and yet can not be piled\r\nup. It is recommended for thin sections when reinforcement is closely\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\n=Medium mixture.= One that is between the wet and dry mixture. This\r\nconsistency is recommended for general work.\r\n\r\n=Dry mixture.= One about like damp earth. If a handful is squeezed it\r\nwill retain its shape. This consistency requires thorough ramming to\r\neliminate voids and is used when forms are to be removed immediately,\r\nbut should not be used where a water-tight job is expected. The porous\r\nstructure of the concrete in Figure 2 is due to the fact that it was\r\nplaced as a dry mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATING.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATING CONCRETE.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the amount of concrete in a given piece of work and the\r\nquantities of materials required, the unit of measurement is usually the\r\ncubic yard (27 cubic feet). The following examples will explain best the\r\nmethod of determining the quantities required:\r\n\r\n  =Example 1.=--A wall 9 inches thick, 12 feet high, and 30 feet long\r\n      has a door opening 3 feet wide and 6 feet high, also a footing 18\r\n      inches wide and 9 inches deep. The concrete is to be mixed in the\r\n      proportions of 1:2:4.\r\n\r\n      The volume of the footing is found by multiplying together the\r\n      dimensions expressed in feet, thus, 1-1/2 × 3/4 × 30 = 33-3/4 cubic\r\n      feet. Similarly, the volume in the wall is 3/4 × 12 × 30, less the\r\n      door opening 3/4 × 3 × 6 = 256-1/2 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n      The total volume in footing and wall is 290-1/4 cubic feet = 10-3/4\r\n      cubic yards.\r\n\r\n      To find the quantity of cement, sand, and gravel, multiply the\r\n      amounts for 1 cubic yard, indicated in line 7 of Table 1, by\r\n      10-3/4, and it will be found that 65 sacks of cement, 4.83 cubic\r\n      yards of sand, and 9.56 cubic yards of gravel are necessary to\r\n      build the wall.\r\n\r\n  =Example 2.=--A pavement 27 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 6 inches\r\n      thick has a 5-inch base mixed in the proportions of 1:3:5 and a\r\n      1-inch surface mixed in the proportions of 1:2.\r\n\r\n      The volume in the base is 27 × 4 × 5/12 = 45 cubic feet = 1-2/3\r\n      cubic yards.\r\n\r\n      The volume in the top is 27 × 4 × 1/12 = 9 cubic feet = 1/3 cubic\r\n      yard.\r\n\r\n      Multiplying the quantities in line 9 of Table 1 by 1-2/3 and those\r\n      in line 2 by it is found that the base requires 7.74 sacks cement;\r\n      0.86 cubic yard sand; 1.43 cubic yards gravel; and the top requires\r\n      4.49 sacks cement; 0.33 cubic yard sand.\r\n\r\n  =Example 3.=[1]--A tank 9 feet inside diameter has walls 6 inches\r\n      thick and 4 feet high (above the floor). The floor is 6 inches\r\n      thick, the concrete is to be 1:2:4.\r\n\r\n      The volume in the floor is 10/2 × 10/2 × 22/7 × 1/2 = 39-2/7 Cubic\r\n      feet.\r\n\r\n      The area of the larger circle is 5 × 5 × 22/7 = 78-4/7 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n      The area of the smaller circle is 4-1/2 × 4-1/2 × 22/7 = 63-4/7\r\n      cubic feet.\r\n\r\n      The area of the wall, therefore, is 15 cubic feet and the volume is\r\n      15 × 4 = 60 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n      The total volume in the structure is 99-2/7 cubic feet or 3-2/3\r\n      cubic yards. Multiplying the quantities in line 7 of Table 1 by\r\n      3-2/3, it is found that the following material is needed: 22.14\r\n      sacks of cement; 1.65 cubic yards of sand; 3.27 cubic yards of\r\n      gravel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A practical rule in finding the area of a circle is to multiply\r\none-half the diameter (radius) by itself and the product by 22/7. In\r\nfinding the volume in the wall of a circular structure, such as a silo\r\nor tank, the area of the circle formed by the inside circumference\r\nis deducted from the area of the circle formed by the outside\r\ncircumference and the remainder is multiplied by the height.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS.\r\n\r\nForms are required to hold the concrete in place until it has attained\r\nsufficient strength to sustain itself and the initial loads to which it\r\nmay be subjected. Concrete is plastic and will assume the shape of the\r\nform, thus any imperfection or impression on the face of the forms will\r\nbe reproduced.\r\n\r\nWood is commonly used for forms, as it can be easily worked into\r\ndifferent shapes, though various other materials sometimes are better\r\nadapted to special conditions. Cast iron, for instance, is suitable for\r\ncasting small objects that are to be reproduced in quantities, such\r\nas concrete block or tile; plaster of Paris, glue, or moist sand are\r\nemployed for casting ornaments or to produce a fine, smooth surface;\r\nsheet metal is suitable when the forms can be used repeatedly or for such\r\ncircular structures as silos. When the sides of an excavation are not\r\nlikely to cave in the earth may serve as a form.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD FORMS.\r\n\r\nWood for forms must be of a kind that is easily worked and that will\r\nretain its shape when exposed to the weather. White pine is the best\r\nwood, but is seldom used because of its cost. Spruce, yellow pine, and\r\nfir are satisfactory woods for forms and are best, used partially green\r\nor unseasoned.\r\n\r\nThe edges of boards should be surfaced, tongued and, grooved, or beveled\r\nin order to obtain a tight form, so that the soft mortar will not ooze\r\nout. A better surface* is secured if the boards are dressed on one side\r\nand are free of loose knots or other imperfections.\r\n\r\nAs forms must be removed, they should be so planned that they can be\r\ntaken down without destroying the lumber, especially if the boards are\r\nused for sheathing or again for forms. Therefore the nailing of the\r\nboards to the support should be only sufficient to keep them in place\r\nuntil the concrete has hardened. Greasing the surface next to the\r\nconcrete with crude oil, soap solution, or linseed oil will prevent the\r\nconcrete from adhering and facilitate removal.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAL FORMS.\r\n\r\nMetal forms can be used to advantage when the work involved is to be\r\nrepeated many times. If it is known or if it is probable that the forms\r\nmay have to be altered, the relative costs of wood and metal forms should\r\nbe carefully determined.\r\n\r\nMetal forms of various types and designs may be purchased. Although the\r\nfirst cost may be high, yet their use may lower the total cost when the\r\nwork is such as to warrant it.\r\n\r\nCircular forms may be built as shown in Figure 3. The sheathing is\r\ngenerally of wood 4 to 6 inches wide, or sheet metal, and, if of wood,\r\nis laid perpendicular to the battens. In forms of small diameter, sheet\r\nmetal sheathing is necessary if a smooth surface is desired, as the\r\n4-inch boards can not be made to conform to a true circle. The radius\r\nused for cutting the battens of the inner circle should be the thickness\r\nof the sheathing less than the inside radius of the structure and the\r\nsame amount greater than the outer radius for the outside battens.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF FORMS.\r\n\r\nThe period of time after which forms may be removed varies according to\r\nconditions. Rich and dry mixtures set quickly, and warm weather tends to\r\nhasten the setting of concrete. The character of the structural member\r\nand the loadings also must be considered.\r\n\r\nThus, an unloaded wall 12 inches or more thick may be stripped of forms\r\nin from 1 to 3 days, while the forms of thinner walls should remain in\r\nplace from 2 to 5 days. Slab forms and the sides of beam and girder forms\r\nmay be removed in from 6 to 14 days if the span is not over 7 feet. The\r\nbottoms of beam and girder forms, even though of a span less than 7 feet,\r\nshould remain in place and braced form 10 to 14 days and even longer.\r\nExperience is the best guide to the time of removal, but if there is any\r\ndoubt ample time should be allowed, especially in cold weather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Suggestion for circular form.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBUILDING AND SETTING FORMS.\r\n\r\nConcrete, while plastic, exerts a great pressure on the confining\r\nwalls, necessitating rigid tying and bracing of the forms to keep them\r\nfrom bulging out of alignment. The effect of the bulging of a form is\r\ncorrected only at a considerable expense; hence it is advisable to pour\r\nthe concrete to a depth of not more than 2-1/2 or 3 feet, allowing it to set\r\nor harden before pouring more.\r\n\r\nThe form most used in concrete construction is that for a straight wall.\r\nThe methods of building such a form apply in general to the forms for\r\nmost structural work, though modifications may be necessary to meet\r\nparticular conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Form for basement or cellar wall. The earth may\r\nbe used as an outside form if it is sufficiently firm.]\r\n\r\nThe straight wall form may be built continuous (Figs. 4 and 5), or in\r\npanels of a size convenient to handle, and from stock lengths of lumber\r\n(Fig. 6). Generally the face boards are placed horizontally and secured\r\nto studs or posts. The face boards may be 1 or 2 inches thick and from 6\r\nto 10 inches wide, preference being given to the narrower widths, which\r\nare less liable to cup or warp. The thickness depends upon the spacing\r\nof the studs, the number of times the forms are to be used, and the\r\ndepth of pouring. Ordinary sheathing, if the joints are made tight, is\r\nsatisfactory for foundations of dwellings, etc., and the studs, if 2 by\r\n4 inches, should be spaced 18 inches on centers. The studs for a long,\r\nhigh form had best be 4 by 4 inches or 2 by 6 inches, spaced from 2 to 3\r\nfeet center to center. The studs of the inside and outside forms must be\r\ntied together to prevent spreading; this is conveniently done with No. 10\r\nwire, as shown in Figure 4, or with one-half or three-quarter inch bolts,\r\nwhich is the more expensive method. Bolts should be greased to facilitate\r\nremoval. Temporary spacers of wood, 1 by 2 inches, of a length equal to\r\nthe thickness of the wall, should be used to prevent drawing the forms\r\ntogether when the wire or bolt is tightened. They should be spaced at the\r\nties, but need not be at every wire, and are knocked out and removed as\r\nthe concreting progresses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Straight wall form for level ground.]\r\n\r\nThe ties should be spaced on each stud about 2-1/2 feet vertically. If\r\nmore than 3 feet of concrete is poured at one time the ties should be\r\ncloser together, vertically, at the bottom of each pouring. The thickness\r\nof the wall does not affect the number of ties. On removing the forms the\r\nwires should be clipped close to the face of the concrete and punched\r\nback, unless the surface is to be stuccoed. If a pit hole is caused by\r\npunching back the wire it should be pointed up with mortar, which then\r\nshould be rubbed to make it blend with the general surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXING.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF PLANT.\r\n\r\nBefore starting to mix, annoyance and money may be saved by planning the\r\nlocation of the mixing plant with regard to convenience in depositing\r\nthe concrete in the forms and ease of access to the materials. Often the\r\nboard can be located so that by moving it once or twice the bulk of the\r\nconcrete may be shoveled directly into the forms. It is more economical\r\nto wheel material a distance of from 10 to 25 feet than to carry it in\r\nshovels. Eight feet is about as far as it is profitable to shovel.\r\n\r\nWhen material is to be wheeled, runways of planks should be provided,\r\nbecause more material can be handled in a given time, and the wear and\r\ntear on men and equipment is not so great. The planks used in the runways\r\nshould be thick enough to sustain the weight passing over them and should\r\nbe 10 to 12 inches wide to permit foot room. They should be anchored\r\nsecurely and made rigid, as springy or loose boards retard progress\r\nof the work. Smooth joints in the planking will prevent bumping and\r\nstumbling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Sectional forms.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF MEN.\r\n\r\nThe number of men required is determined by the amount of concrete to be\r\nplaced in a given time, the method of mixing, and the size of the batch;\r\nthat is, the number of bags of cement mixed at one time. The amount of\r\nconcrete one man can mix by hand in a day depends upon the experience of\r\nthe man, the layout of the work, and other duties required of him. One\r\nman should average 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 cubic yards of concrete in eight hours,\r\nincluding mixing and wheeling not more than 50 feet.\r\n\r\nThe gang for a one-bag batch may consist of 3 men, but a larger number\r\nmake a more efficient force, for when the concrete is mixed by hand the\r\nmen can take turns at the various tasks and will not tire so easily. The\r\nassigning of tasks so that each man's time fits into that of the others\r\nrequires considerable study and is one of the chief factors making for\r\nloss or profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINE MIXING.\r\n\r\nGood concrete can be mixed by hand or machine. The quantity of concrete\r\nwork in prospect is the factor that determines the more economical\r\nmethod. A small amount (say 100 to 200 cubic yards) does not warrant the\r\npurchase of a machine, but it is often feasible and economical to hire a\r\nmachine from a neighbor or contractor if the quantity of concrete to be\r\nplaced is more than 15 cubic yards.\r\n\r\nA mixer should be purchased only after careful consideration of the\r\namount and character of the work to be done and the conditions affecting\r\nits use.\r\n\r\nThe two types of mixers most used are the batch mixer, which mixes\r\nand dumps a definite quantity, and the continuous, which discharges a\r\nconstant stream of concrete. The continuous type is not adapted to farm\r\nwork unless the concrete can be handled as fast as it is mixed, thus\r\npermitting the machine to work continuously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Home made concrete mixer.]\r\n\r\nThere are numerous types and various sizes of batch mixers. A one-bag\r\nbatch machine is most suitable for general work, though there are smaller\r\nmixers that may prove handy. Some of the smallest sizes are operated by\r\nhand, but the medium and large sizes are power operated. Mixers can be\r\nhad with or without the power plant attached and may be stationary or\r\non wheels, which facilitate moving to different sites. Engines used for\r\nsawing wood, the larger ones used for pumping water, and tractors furnish\r\nsufficient power to operate an average mixer. Figure 7 shows a homemade\r\nmixer built of discarded farm implement parts and operated by the farm\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nDirections for operating a mixer are generally furnished with the\r\nmachine. The tendency is to use too much water in mixing concrete in a\r\nmachine. The consistency of the mixture should be as described under the\r\nheading \"Consistency\" on page 8. The mixing should be continued for at\r\nleast a minute after the drum has been charged, but a better mixture is\r\nsecured if two minutes are allowed. At the end of each day's work the\r\nmachine should be thoroughly washed, and when not in use it should be\r\nwell greased and covered.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAND MIXING.\r\n\r\nHand mixing is the more economical on the farm unless a large amount\r\nof work is to be done at one time. Few tools need be purchased, and,\r\nas a rule, only farm help need be employed. The following tools will\r\nbe needed in mixing and placing plain concrete: Two or more square-end\r\nshort-handled shovels, 1 heavy garden rake, 1 sprinkling can or bucket\r\n(if a hose is not available), 1 52-gallon barrel, 2 wheelbarrows with\r\nmetal trays, 1 sand screen (Fig. 8), 1 tamper (Fig. 9), 1 wood float or\r\ntrowel (Fig. 10), measuring boxes (Fig. 11), mixing board (Fig. 12), 1\r\nspader (Fig. 13). The number of shovels and wheelbarrows needed will\r\ndepend upon the size of the batch, number of men mixing, and the layout\r\nof the work. Long-handled pointed shovels will be found more convenient\r\nat the sand and gravel piles.\r\n\r\nA bottomless box is necessary for convenient and accurate measurement\r\nof the sand and gravel. Where wheelbarrow measurement of materials is\r\npracticed, as in charging a mixer, the capacity of the wheelbarrow\r\nshould be determined by use of a measuring box. The box may be made as\r\nillustrated in Figure 11, from boards 12 inches wide. The dimensions in\r\nTable 2 are of boxes for use in measuring quantities for mixtures of\r\nvarious proportions, assuming that one bag of cement is used in a batch.\r\nIf two bags are used in a batch the boxes should be filled twice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Sand screen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Tampers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Wooden float.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Measuring box.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Mixing Board.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Spading tool.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 2.--_Inside dimensions of measuring boxes for various proportions._\r\n\r\n     [1-bag batch, box 12 inches deep.]\r\n\r\n  Proportion.

For mixing 1 or 2 bag batches a\r\nplatform 9 by 10 feet will serve.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR HAND MIXING.\r\n\r\nThe mixing board should be located in convenient relation to the supply\r\nof materials and the work and should be level. The sand box is placed\r\non the board, about 2 feet from one of the longer sides, and filled\r\nlevel with sand; the box is then lifted away and the sand spread in a 3\r\nor 4 inch layer. The cement is spread as evenly as possible on' top of\r\nthe sand. Two men with shovels, standing on opposite sides of the pile,\r\nturn the sand and cement in such a way that the materials axe thoroughly\r\nmixed. In turning the material it should not be simply dumped off the\r\nshovel, but should be shaken off the ends and sides, so that the two\r\nconstituents will be mixed as they fall. The mass should be turned two\r\nor three times, or until it is of uniform color and there are no streaks\r\nof either sand or cement. A man with a hoe or rake may assist by raking\r\nthe top over as the two men turn. When the sand-cement mixture is of a\r\nuniform color it should be spread out carefully in a layer and the gravel\r\nbox placed on top. The box is filled with gravel and then removed, the\r\ngravel being spread over the sand-cement mixture. The mass is soaked with\r\nabout one-half the quantity of water to be used, care being taken not to\r\nwash away any of the cement. The materials then should be turned over\r\nin much the same manner as was the sand-cement, except that instead of\r\nshaking them off the end of the shovel the whole load should be dumped\r\nand dragged back toward the mixer with the square end of the shovel.\r\nThe wet gravel picks up the sand and cement as it rolls over when\r\ndragged back. The mixing should be continued until the mass is uniform,\r\nwater being added to the dry spots during the mixing until the desired\r\nconsistency is obtained.\r\n\r\nExperience counts considerably in mixing concrete with the least amount\r\nof labor; ordinarily three or four turnings are required to mix the\r\nmaterials thoroughly. After the final turning the concrete should be\r\nshoveled into a compact pile and then is ready for placing in the forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLACING.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLACING CONCRETE.\r\n\r\nThe mixed concrete should be deposited in the forms within from 20 to 30\r\nminutes from the time the water is added to the cement, as it begins to\r\nset or harden after this time. To disturb the concrete after the set has\r\nbegun is risky, as it will lose some of its strength, the extent of the\r\ninjury depending upon the seriousness of the disturbance.\r\n\r\nConcrete which has set before it can be placed in the forms should not be\r\ntempered or softened with water, but should be discarded.\r\n\r\nTo prevent delay in placing, all forms should be examined before the\r\nmixing is begun to see that they are properly braced, that all chips or\r\nloose particles are removed, that the surface of concrete which has set\r\nhas been properly roughened and wetted to assure a bond, as described on\r\npage 20, and that all reinforcement, bolts, inserts, etc., are properly\r\nlocated and secured.\r\n\r\nAt the lunch' period, or at the end of a day's work, the mixing board\r\nand equipment should be thoroughly washed, for if this is not done many\r\npounds of heavy concrete are needlessly carried around by the men and the\r\naddition of a pound in the weight of tools will lower the efficiency of\r\nthe workers. Moreover, it will save time and wear and tear of equipment\r\nincident to cutting the surplus concrete away with a cold chisel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--1592 Showing result of leaky forms and poor\r\nplacing. The soft cement mortar ran out, leaving areas of honeycombed\r\nsurface not necessarily harmful but unsightly.]\r\n\r\nIn depositing concrete in the forms care should be taken that the\r\nmaterials do not separate.\r\n\r\nIf the mixing is done close to the place of depositing, the concrete\r\nmay be shoveled into the forms directly or through a chute. If it is\r\nnecessary to lift or transport the concrete, buckets and wheelbarrows are\r\nconvenient containers. The concrete should be deposited in horizontal\r\nlayers, preferably not over 6 inches thick, and a spade or paddle should\r\nbe worked up and down against the forms to push the coarse material\r\naway from the surface, as illustrated in Figure 13. The object of the\r\nspading is to eliminate impounded air that may form pockets in the mass\r\nand to insure a smoother and more impervious surface. In addition to\r\nbeing spaded, stiff concrete should be rammed until water flushes to\r\nthe surface. Tapping the forms with a hammer is a very effective way of\r\nsecuring a smooth surface. Figure 14 shows the result of improper spading.\r\n\r\nFresh concrete will riot bond readily to concrete that has hardened and\r\na seam may be formed that will permit water to trickle through. When\r\nbonding fresh concrete to that which has been in place for a short time\r\nit is usually sufficient to roughen the hardened surface with a pick or\r\nby other means so as to expose the gravel or stone, and to clean off\r\nall loose particles. The hardened concrete should be soaked with water,\r\nthe excess water removed, and the surface then given a coat of grout (a\r\nmixture of cement and water) of the consistency of cream just before the\r\nnew concrete is deposited.\r\n\r\nWhen pouring of a wall is to be discontinued for some time, provision for\r\nthe bonding of future work should be made. This may be done by placing\r\nshort steel dowels in the concrete when it is poured, or a rebated joint\r\nor groove may be made, as shown in Figure 15. In bonding a new wall to\r\nold concrete, holes should be drilled for the dowels, which should be\r\ngrouted in, and the old surface should be roughened, cleaned, and wetted;\r\nor a groove may be cut in the old wall to receive the new concrete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Method of forming horizontal rebate.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLACING UNDER WATER.\r\n\r\nConcrete can be placed under still water if proper precautions are taken.\r\nIt should never be placed, while soft, in running water unless a form or\r\ncofferdam is used, as the cement will be washed out. When concrete is to\r\nbe placed under water a form of tube or chute, known as a tremie (Fig.\r\n16), may be used advantageously. The tube should be of sheet metal, about\r\n8 inches in diameter, with a hopper on top, and means should be provided\r\nfor quickly raising and lowering it without jolts, so that the concrete\r\nwill feed out at the bottom without breaking the seal. The lower end of\r\nthe tube should rest on the bottom or on the concrete as it is built up\r\nand a continuous flow of concrete, mixed somewhat soft so that it will\r\nflow easily, should be maintained.\r\n\r\nScum or laitance is likely to form on concrete when placed under water,\r\nand unless all of the concrete is! poured in one operation and brought to\r\na little above the water surface, seams or planes of weakness will occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF CONCRETE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the concrete has been poured, care should be taken that it does not\r\ndry out too quickly, and in hot weather it must be protected from the\r\nsun. Exposed surfaces and objects made of dry concrete should be sprayed\r\nthoroughly with water twice or oftener each day for a week or 10 days.\r\nSometimes surfaces are shielded with canvas, paper, boards, or layers of\r\nmoist sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Tremie for use in placing concrete under water.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION FROM FREEZING WEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCRETING IN FREEZING WEATHER.\r\n\r\nIf suitable methods are used, good concrete work can be done in cold\r\nweather, but with more difficulty and at somewhat greater cost than when\r\nthe weather is warm. Ordinarily it is best not to attempt to do concrete\r\nwork during freezing weather. However, the extra cost at times may be\r\nwarranted by urgent need of the structure or the fact that other farm\r\nwork is not so pressing during the winter and the concrete work may be\r\ncarried on without seriously interfering with regular farm operations.\r\n\r\nConcrete must be protected from alternate freezing and thawing until it\r\nhas set. Cold retards the setting and hardening of concrete; therefore,\r\neven though the temperature is not at the freezing point, the concrete\r\nshould be protected and special care taken not to subject it to loads.\r\nThe forms should be kept in place until there is no doubt that the\r\nconcrete has properly hardened. Hot water should be poured on the\r\nconcrete to make sure that apparent hardness is real and not due to a\r\nfrozen condition. Just before the concrete is placed all ice and frost\r\nshould be removed from the forms and reinforcement, if used, by warming\r\nthe surfaces with steam or by other means.\r\n\r\nConcrete that has been frozen once may, with proper care, attain its\r\nultimate strength, but should it freeze a second time the chances of\r\nsaving the work are very slight. Exposed surfaces are apt to scale or pit\r\nif the concrete is allowed to freeze before it is thoroughly hardened.\r\n\r\nPleating the materials, protecting the green concrete, and the use of\r\nsalt are precautions generally taken to prevent freezing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF SALT.\r\n\r\nThe use of salt is objectionable, as it forms a white efflorescence\r\non exterior surfaces and is liable to corrode the steel in reinforced\r\nconcrete work. The quantity of salt required varies with the temperature,\r\nbut it should not exceed 10 per cent of the weight of the water used\r\nin mixing. A 10 per cent solution is eight-tenths (approximately 13\r\nounces) of a pound of salt per gallon of water and will prevent freezing\r\nat a temperature of 22° F. Lower temperatures would require a greater\r\nproportion of salt, which would impair the strength of the concrete, and\r\nhence is not practicable.\r\n\r\nA rule, frequently advocated, for varying the percentage of salt is\r\nto use 1-1/3 ounces per gallon of water for each degree Fahrenheit\r\nbelow freezing. Since it is impossible to foretell the exact drop in\r\ntemperature, the exact quantity of salt can not be predetermined, so that\r\nprovision should be made for several degrees lower than anticipated.\r\nThe salt should be dissolved in the mixing water, and in order that the\r\nproportion be correct the amount of water required for each batch should\r\nbe determined by trial and this quantity used throughout the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF HEAT.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most satisfactory method of preventing freezing of concrete\r\nis to heat the materials and to inclose or cover the completed work for\r\na few days or until most of the water has disappeared and sufficient\r\nstrength has developed. In extreme weather protection may be needed for\r\nfive or six days. When the weather is cold but not freezing, heating the\r\nmaterials will be sufficient. If a freeze is expected the concrete work\r\nshould be protected by wood inclosures, paper, or canvas, over which, if\r\nthe surface is horizontal, may be spread a 6 or 8 inch layer of straw.\r\nManure should not be used to protect fresh concrete, since the acids in\r\nit are destructive and cause unsightly stains. Splits or other openings\r\nin coverings may admit cold, which may freeze parts of the work. As the\r\ntemperature drops (to about 20° F.) it will be necessary to arrange the\r\ncovering so that live steam can be turned in between it and the concrete\r\nor that heat may be supplied from stoves or salamanders.\r\n\r\nMass work, except in very cold weather, will not require as careful\r\nprotection as thin sections and, as a rule, the forms are sufficient if\r\nthe exposed parts are covered.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEATING MATERIALS.\r\n\r\nThe water can be heated sufficiently for use in concrete (approximately\r\n150° F.) in kettles on stoves or by steam from a boiler.\r\n\r\nA metal smokestack placed horizontally with a fire in one end makes an\r\nefficient heater for the sand and gravel. The materials are piled over\r\nthe stack, but not so high that their weight will crush the pipe. Small\r\nquantities of sand and gravel may be heated on top of metal plate with\r\na fire under it. If a small boiler is available it may be economical to\r\nuse steam for heating the sand and gravel. Steam is effective when forced\r\nfrom nozzles into the piles or circulated through perforated pipes placed\r\nunder the material. Covering the piles with canvas or other material will\r\nretain much of the heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRACTION AND EXPANSION JOINTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcrete expands and contracts with changes in temperature, causing\r\ncracks to appear. Contraction cracks occur in thin sections exposed to\r\nwide variations in temperature and are common in sidewalks; therefore,\r\nlarge stretches of concrete should not be laid without breaks or spaces\r\nto allow for the changes in size. The spaces should be filled with tar or\r\nsome similar material that will yield or give when the concrete expands.\r\nA joint like that shown in Figure 17 is frequently used for thick walls.\r\nA section of the wall is poured and before the next is poured the\r\nabutting end is covered with tar and paper, the thickness of the covering\r\ndepending upon the length of the section and the exposure. Sidewalks and\r\nsimilar work, when not cast in alternate blocks, should have a one-fourth\r\ninch space left at intervals of 40 feet. The joint may be filled with tar\r\npaper or tar. Steel is used to take care of contraction in long or high\r\nwalls and water-tight work. Important structures in which temperature\r\nreinforcement is necessary should be designed by one experienced in\r\nconcrete design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Expansion joint showing rebate form removed and\r\nfiller in place.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINTELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of reinforced concrete is not within the province of this\r\nbulletin, but as openings of various widths are required in the walls of\r\nmost farm structures, a general explanation is given of the reinforcement\r\nof lintels or that portion of concrete immediately above an opening, such\r\nas a floor or window.\r\n\r\nA lintel is a beam, and when a beam bends the lower part is stretched or\r\npulled while the upper portion is compressed. Good concrete will stand\r\ngreat pressure but is not capable of resisting any great pulling or\r\ntensile stress. For this reason steel is used in the lower portion to\r\ntake care of the tensile or pulling force.\r\n\r\nIt will be found generally satisfactory, where no heavy or concentrated\r\nload occurs over an opening and the span is not more than 4 feet, to\r\nplace two rods three-eighths of an inch in diameter in the bottom of the\r\nlintel, so that there will be 1 inch of concrete below them. Two diagonal\r\nrods should be placed at each top corner of a window or door, as shown\r\nin Figure 18. When the opening is between 4 and 8 feet the rods should\r\nbe bent up as shown in Figure 19 and when between 8 and 12 feet, three\r\none-half inch rods should be used, two of them being bent.\r\n\r\nBarbed wire, old fencing, and scrap or rusty iron is not suitable for\r\nreinforcement. Loose rust should be cleaned off the rods and they should\r\nbe free of grease and oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Reinforcement of openings less than 4 feet wide.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Reinforcement of openings more than 4 feet wide.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURFACE FINISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoints and imperfections in the forms are reproduced on the concrete\r\nsurfaces. Patches of honeycomb and rough places are left where the mortar\r\nhas run out of the forms or where the concrete has not been properly\r\nplaced. Such imperfections do not necessarily affect the strength of the\r\nconcrete, but they do detract from the appearance (see Fig. 14). Too of\r\nten the finishing of the concrete work in even the more important farm\r\nbuildings is neglected. With little extra trouble exposed surfaces can\r\nbe given a finish which will add to the attractiveness and hence the\r\nvalue of the completed work. Rubbing off the form marks and pointing up\r\ndepressions or holes greatly improves the appearance of the work. The\r\nrubbing may be done with a wooden float or hard-burned brick, using a\r\nlittle sand and water as an abrasive and a 1:2 mortar for pointing up.\r\nThe surface can be worked best if the forms are removed within 24 hours\r\nor before the concrete has set too hard. After the concrete has hardened\r\nit may be necessary to use a carborundum block for rubbing.\r\n\r\nA pleasing finish can be secured by scrubbing the surface with a stiff\r\nfiber or wire brush, using plenty of water to wash off the loosened\r\nparticles. The work must be done while the surface is workable for if the\r\nconcrete is too green or soft the aggregate will break out and if too\r\nhard the work can not be done effectively.\r\n\r\nArtistic effects can be secured by picking or tooling the surface with\r\na bush hammer, toothed chisel, or pick. For such treatment the concrete\r\nshould be two or three weeks old to prevent breaking out the aggregate.\r\nOther finishes may be obtained by etching with acid to expose selected\r\ncolored aggregates and by the application of stucco. The limitations\r\nof the bulletin do not permit of a discussion of these more elaborate\r\ntreatments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCRETE EXPOSED TO FIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcrete is practically fireproof in that it can not be consumed by fire,\r\nbut unless properly made and of the right materials it will disintegrate,\r\nat least on the surface.\r\n\r\nTo resist fire concrete should be mixed fairly rich, say, 1:1-1/2:3, or\r\n1:2:4 and special care should be taken to grade the sand and gravel to\r\nsecure a dense mixture.\r\n\r\nThe aggregates should be selected with a view to their fire-resisting\r\nproperties. The sand should be siliceous and the larger aggregate\r\nshould not disintegrate when heated; hence, marble, granite, limestone,\r\nmaterials containing quartz, and some gravels are unsuitable. Cinders are\r\nspecially valuable, due to their non-conductivity, but can not be used\r\nwhere strength is required. Trap rock will resist destruction by heat\r\nand produce a strong concrete. Blast furnace slag is very good for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nFireplaces and chimneys of dwellings[2] may be constructed of ordinary\r\nconcrete but the back, jambs, and inner hearth, which are directly\r\nexposed to the heat of the fire, should be made of specially prepared\r\nconcrete as described above or should be lined with firebrick, although\r\nconcrete made with broken hard-burned brick or terra cotta has been\r\nused successfully. If suitable large-sized aggregate is not available a\r\nmixture of one part cement and three parts sand may be used.\r\n\r\n[2] See Farmers' Bulletin No. 1230, Chimneys and Fireplaces, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER-TIGHT CONCRETE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical water-tightness in concrete may be secured by using a fairly\r\nrich mixture properly proportioned. Foreign ingredients, membrane and\r\nsurface coatings, or other means need not be used, except where poor\r\nworkmanship is likely or where considerable damage and inconvenience\r\nmay result in case of leakage. Under such circumstances the membrane\r\ntreatment used in addition to a properly proportioned concrete, while\r\nthe most expensive method of waterproofing, probably will give the most\r\nreliable results. This treatment consists of layers of burlap or tar\r\npaper cemented to the surface and together with tar or asphalt. Where the\r\nmembrane is subject to injury it is sometimes protected by a coating of\r\ncement mortar or brick backing.\r\n\r\nFirst-class workmanship and special attention to details are required\r\nto secure water-tightness. The essential requisite is that the voids be\r\nfilled. A lean mixture may be made more impervious by using hydrated\r\nlime which tends to fill the voids and makes the concrete flow easily. A\r\nlittle more cement in the mixture would serve the same purpose. The lime\r\nshould not be in excess of 10 per cent of the weight of the cement and\r\nunder no circumstances should unslaked lime be used.\r\n\r\nThe materials for water-tight concrete must be well graded, so as to\r\nobtain a maximum density; that is, enough sand must be used to fill the\r\nspaces between the gravel or stone and enough cement to fill the spaces\r\nbetween the grains of sand. A 1:2:4 concrete will prove practically\r\nimpermeable in ordinary construction, but if a head or pressure of\r\nwater is to be resisted a 1:2:3 or richer mixture may be necessary. The\r\nconsistency is very important. A sluggishly flowing consistency is best,\r\nfor if the concrete is too wet the mortar may flow away from the stone,\r\nleaving leaky places and, if too dry, the mass may prove porous. The\r\nproportions and consistency must be accurately maintained for each batch\r\nand the concrete must be exceptionally well mixed.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to exercise great care in the placing of the concrete.\r\nWhere practicable, the structure or object should be poured in one\r\noperation to avoid leaky joints, but when this is not possible\r\nprecautions should be taken to secure a tight joint between concrete of\r\ndifferent ages. The surface of concrete which has set must be cleaned of\r\ndirt and scum down to the true concrete. This surface then should be well\r\nwhetted and painted immediately with a creamy mixture of cement and water\r\nbefore placing the new concrete. A good plan, when discontinuing work on\r\nstructures intended to hold liquids, is to embed a 6 or 8 inch strip of\r\ntin or thin sheet metal to half its width in the concrete so that the\r\nother half will project into the new concrete.\r\n\r\nA wall thick enough to resist the stresses put upon it will generally\r\nresist percolation of water, but 6 inches may be considered as a minimum.\r\n\r\nContraction and expansion must be controlled to avoid the occurrence of\r\nleaks. To guard against cracks due to unequal settlement or other causes,\r\nmost concrete designed for water-tightness should be reinforced. In some\r\nmass work, special contraction joints, as described on page 23 may be\r\nnecessary. Rules for the use of reinforcement and contraction joints can\r\nnot be given, as the requirements in each case vary with the conditions\r\nto be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ORGANIZATION OF THE\r\n                 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n                            October 21, 1929\r\n\r\n  _Secretary of Agriculture_              Arthur M.
