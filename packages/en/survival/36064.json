Larger cash receipts\r\nand smaller cash expenditures will result in better bank balances.\r\n\r\n                                                   JOHNSON & STOKES.\r\n\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, January 1, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMAKING THE SOIL RICH.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody understands that the soil becomes impoverished by continued\r\ncropping, if no return be made in the form of manure or fertilizer.\r\nThis impoverishment is sometimes real, while sometimes it is more\r\napparent than real, owing to the exhaustion of only one or two\r\nelements of fertility.\r\n\r\nFarmers have learned a great deal about agricultural chemistry since\r\nthe introduction of artificial fertilizers. They know that while\r\nplants demand many things for their growth, there are but three\r\nelements which are in danger of being exhausted in ordinary cropping.\r\nThese three things are nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash.\r\n\r\n=Lime.=--Lime is used on the land not for its direct results as a\r\nfertilizer, but because it has the ability to break up combinations\r\nalready existing in the soil and set free the plant food that\r\npreviously was in an insoluble form. Lime sometimes produces almost\r\nmarvelous results; at other times no visible effects whatever. Hence,\r\nit is not a fertilizer, though in actual practice it is sometimes a\r\nfertilizing agent of great value. Land that has been much manured or\r\nlong in sod is likely to be benefited by lime.\r\n\r\nArtificial manures, on the other hand, furnish real plant food in\r\nsoluble form, and may be expected to produce crops invariably, year\r\nafter year, if the soil be sufficiently moist. When a fertilizer\r\ncontains nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash it is said to be\r\ncomplete. When any element is missing the fertilizer is said to be\r\nincomplete. Ground bone, wood ashes, South Carolina rock, kainit,\r\netc., are examples of incomplete fertilizers.\r\n\r\n=Barnyard Manure.=--Barnyard manure is the best of all known\r\nfertilizers. Not only is it complete in character, but it has the\r\nhighly valuable property of bulk. It is rich in humus or humus-forming\r\nmaterials. It opens and ventilates the soil, and improves its\r\nmechanical condition to a remarkable degree. Humus is a name for\r\ndecaying organic matter.\r\n\r\nAmerican market gardeners deem it entirely safe to use fifty to\r\nseventy-five tons of barnyard manure to the acre of ground in their\r\nintensive cultural operations. American farmers seldom apply more than\r\nten or fifteen tons of such manure to the acre in the open field.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of artificial fertilizers had its origin in the fact\r\nthat cultivators could not get enough manure from natural sources,\r\nand, hence, were compelled to go into the market and buy nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid and potash in other forms.\r\n\r\n=Closer Economy.=--With the increase of competition and consequent\r\nfall of prices a closer economy in cost of production is necessary.\r\nPrices have fallen most in respect to commodities that will bear\r\nlong-distance freight transit and less in respect to the more\r\nperishable products of the soil. Hence, farmers have widely turned\r\nattention to small fruits and vegetables for money crops, instead of\r\ngrains, and are now studying how to fertilize these crops in the most\r\neffective and economical manner.\r\n\r\nIt is very evident that while great quantities of fertility are\r\ndemanded by the new crops, there is no such margin of profit in their\r\nculture as to warrant wasteful methods, and no losses of home-produced\r\nfertility can be tolerated.\r\n\r\n=As to Saving Manure.=--A penny saved is a penny earned. A half ton of\r\nmanure saved is a dollar earned; and, conversely, a half ton of manure\r\nwasted is a dollar wasted.\r\n\r\nIn many American barnyards much of the manure is lost, partly by\r\nleaching and partly by escape of ammonia. It is estimated that as much\r\nas a third of the natural manure produced in this country is\r\npractically thrown away.\r\n\r\nThe Cornell Station has announced that a pile of horse manure exposed\r\nto the weather will lose half of its value in six months. The Kansas\r\nStation reaches nearly the same conclusion about farmyard manure.\r\n\r\nManure stored under cover may lose from 14 to 30 per cent. of its\r\nnitrogen (ammonia); and as this element is the most expensive of all\r\nto buy, it is evident that the loss is a very serious one, and one\r\nthat should be avoided if possible.\r\n\r\n=General Principles of Storage.=--Having pointed out the fact that on\r\nmany farms there is a loss of a large amount of excellent manure, it\r\nis now in order to name a remedy. The compass of this book is so\r\nlimited that it is necessary to go straight to the point, omitting a\r\ndetailed account of the chemical processes involved.\r\n\r\nThe best-known method of keeping all the manure produced by farm\r\nanimals is storage under a closed shed, supplemented with chemical\r\npreservatives. The shed need not cover the barnyard, but merely the\r\nmanure pile. The preservatives cost little money, and eventually go to\r\nthe soil in the form of excellent fertilizers. Not a cent paid for\r\nthem need be lost.\r\n\r\nThe manure shed should be large enough to work in with comfort; large\r\nenough to permit the heap or heaps of manure to be turned, worked over\r\nand shifted from place to place. A clay or earth floor will answer\r\nevery purpose, and the shed may be of the cheapest character, provided\r\nit will turn the rain. The floor of the manure shed should slope\r\ninward from all directions, and the drainage around the shed should be\r\noutward, so that no rain-water or snow-water can enter.\r\n\r\nIn theory, it may be best to put fresh manure on the land as quickly\r\nas possible. All leaching is then received by the soil, and little is\r\nlost, except through the air.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this plan is not always a good one. It costs more to make\r\nten trips to the field than one trip, and valuable time is wasted. It\r\nis quite out of the question to haul out manure every day or even\r\nevery week. Besides, it is necessary in actual practice, especially in\r\ngardening or truck farming, to cover a whole piece of ground at one\r\ntime, so that it may be plowed and seeded for the coming crop. The\r\nground is usually available only a short time before this preparation,\r\nhaving, perhaps, been occupied by something else. It is desirable,\r\nmoreover, that the manure when applied shall be ready for immediate\r\nservice as plant food, which is not the case with the raw product.\r\nFresh manure is but sparingly digestible by plant roots. Quicker cash\r\nresults will be secured by applying prepared manure to the soil than\r\nby applying the product fresh from the stable.\r\n\r\nThe manure shed has already been mentioned. A few dollars will build\r\nit. Sometimes a half barrel is sunken in the centre of the manure\r\nshed, and the drainage from the manure heaps collected there, and\r\nreturned to the tops of the heaps. It is occasionally necessary to add\r\nwater, when turning manure, to secure the desired degree of dampness\r\nand a gentle fermentation. This fermentation will cause the litter to\r\nfall to pieces, and will convert it into quickly-available plant food.\r\n\r\nNo one who has never tried it will expect the generous heaps which\r\nwill follow systematic and persevering efforts to accumulate and stack\r\nup the available manure materials on any farm.\r\n\r\n=Preservatives.=--The best-known common preservatives of manure in\r\nstorage are gypsum, kainit and acid phosphate.\r\n\r\nGypsum or land plaster holds ammonia, and is thus of the highest value\r\nas a preservative. Gypsum must be moist to be effective, and, hence,\r\nshould be used regularly upon the fresh manure.\r\n\r\nKainit, which is a low-grade sulphate of potash, checks fermentation,\r\nand hence prevents loss of ammonia. It contains much salt, and attracts\r\nand holds moisture. It should not be used under the feet of animals.\r\n\r\nAcid phosphate contains much gypsum, and unites with ammonia that\r\nwould otherwise escape.\r\n\r\nThe Geneva (N. Y.) Station recommends the use of one of the following\r\nper day:\r\n\r\n                    Per Horse. Per Cow. Per Pig. Per Sheep.\r\n                     Pounds.   Pounds.   Ounces.  Ounces.\r\n    Gypsum            1-1/2     1-3/4    4-1/2     3-1/2\r\n    Acid phosphate    1         1-1/8    3         2-1/2\r\n    Kainit            1-1/8     1-1/4    4         3-1/4\r\n\r\nThe advantage of using kainit and acid phosphate are that they add\r\npotash and phosphoric acid respectively, in which barnyard manure is\r\nlikely to be deficient. In some soils the potash will be preferable;\r\nin others, phosphoric acid will do more good.\r\n\r\n=Value of Manure of Each Kind of Animal.=--It has been figured out\r\nthat the average value of horse manure per year is $27 per animal;\r\ncattle, $19; hogs, $12; and sheep, $2. But these are not the only\r\nsources of manure on the farm. The hen-house will annually yield\r\nmanure to the value of 25 to 50 cents per fowl, if intelligently cared\r\nfor. The outhouse will produce fertility to the amount of $10 to $50\r\nper year, according to the size of the family, the precautions as to\r\nloss by leaching, and the care given. The kitchen slops, including the\r\nscraps, are worth $10 to $25 per year, if properly composted. The wood\r\nashes have a distinct and high fertilizing value; but not in the\r\nhen-house, where they are worse than wasted. And even coal ashes can\r\nbe turned to account.\r\n\r\nProfessor Roberts has suggested $250 per year as a conservative\r\nestimate of the value of the manure produced during seven winter\r\nmonths on a farm carrying four horses, twenty cows, fifty sheep and\r\nten pigs. The estimated value may be made much higher in cases where\r\nfarmers are willing to use thought and labor in preparation and\r\npreservation of home-made manures.\r\n\r\n=Solid Manure and Liquid Manure.=--The urine is the most valuable\r\nportion of the excretion of animals, according to the tables of the\r\nagricultural chemists. It is especially rich in nitrogen, and, hence,\r\nits strong odor under fermentation. It is also rich in potash. Its\r\nplace is on the manure heap, not in a ditch leading to a brook. If it\r\ncollects in quantities beyond the absorbing power of the manure pile,\r\nit should go on the compost heap or else be diluted and at once put\r\nupon the land.\r\n\r\n=When to Fertilize.=--The land is a good bank in which to deposit\r\nmoney in the form of manure; but there are certain portions of the\r\nyear when the land bank declares no dividends. It is safe to put\r\nmanure upon an unfrozen soil at any time, but the best, the quickest,\r\nand the largest results are obtained by manuring during the growing\r\nseason, preferably just before planting the crop. Small applications,\r\noften repeated, are preferable to large, though rare, applications.\r\nPlants, like animals, consume small amounts of food each day, and\r\ncannot take a year's food at a single meal.\r\n\r\n=Humus.=--Humus, often referred to by agricultural writers, is a name\r\nfor decaying organic matter in the soil. Green crops turned under,\r\ngrass roots, stubble, leaves, long manure, etc., form humus. The term\r\nis a comprehensive one. Humus is a dark-colored substance, abundant in\r\nall rich ground. A lump of manure that has been lying in the ground\r\nfor a year or two has become, practically, a mass of humus.\r\n\r\n=Minute Soil Workers.=--In all good soils there are myriads of small\r\norganisms, whose duty is to destroy organic matter and convert it into\r\nsoil, or into humus, or into plant food.\r\n\r\nThis explains the superiority of good, moist soil as compared to coal\r\nashes for making compost heaps. Coal ashes are worth sifting, if the\r\nwork can be done automatically; that is, by simply pouring the ashes\r\nupon a sloping wire screen. The coarse portion of the ashes, if not\r\nworth reburning, will at least make good walks, drives or road beds,\r\nwhile the fine portions make excellent absorbents to put under hen\r\nroosts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Some of the many Forms of Bacteria. (Magnified).]\r\n\r\nHen manure and the product of the outhouse, whether containing sifted\r\nashes or not, should go speedily into a heap of moist earth, for this\r\nearth will furnish the organisms to quickly convert the excreta into\r\nvaluable soil. Sifted coal ashes usually contain some fertility on\r\naccount of wood, garbage, etc., burned in the kitchen stove, but have\r\nvalue mainly as absorbents. Moist loam, on the other hand, teems with\r\nlife, and has the wonderful ability not merely to hide organic matter,\r\nbut to actually change its character, converting it into soil that\r\nretains none of its original characteristics. What was malodorous\r\nmanure, offensive to smell and touch, is changed into an odorless,\r\ndark-colored material that leaves no stain upon the hands, and which\r\nis plant food of the best and most available character.\r\n\r\n=Economy in Manuring.=--True economy in manuring demands a\r\ncomprehension of these simple matters. The methods are inexpensive,\r\nand are within the reach of every tiller of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter may be summed up in a few words, as follows: Waste\r\nnothing, permit no fermentation or leaching, use preservatives, and\r\nlearn the true art of making composts, including the functions of the\r\nminute organisms just described.\r\n\r\nNo better use can be made of rainy days in summer or winter than in\r\ncaring for manure; turning the piles, making compact stacks, adding\r\nneeded moisture and preservatives, shaking out all lumps and putting\r\nundecayed portions into the centre of the heap.\r\n\r\nTon after ton of the best kind of fertilizer can be accumulated on\r\nevery farm in this manner, including not only what is now lost through\r\ncareless handling, but also a large amount of good material that is\r\nnow entirely overlooked on many farms. All rubbish, all litter, all\r\ndirt, has a fertilizing value. If certain waste products must go to\r\nthe bonfire, the ashes can at least be saved and used during the next\r\ngrowing season. It is sometimes better to burn weeds and certain tough\r\nvines than to attempt to compost them; but the ashes should not be\r\nwasted. It is the saving of many little things that counts in the\r\nyearly total. Labor is money, but it is better to invest labor at home\r\nthan to go to the fertilizer-maker for supplies and pay out cash.\r\n\r\n=The Fertilizer Man.=--The fertilizer man will always be with us,\r\nbecause he has a true place in the economy of the farm and garden. We\r\nmust go to him for the preservatives already mentioned--for gypsum,\r\nfor kainit and for acid phosphate; and also for complete fertilizers.\r\nThese articles are all comparatively cheap. The fertilizer man can\r\nmake but modest profits upon them. The purchase of high-grade goods\r\nfrom well-known and honest makers is to be commended, for it is\r\nstrictly economical.\r\n\r\nThe thing to be avoided is the blind buying of fertilizers from\r\nunknown or irresponsible makers or agents. This is worse than buying a\r\ncat in a bag, and results in great waste of good money.\r\n\r\n=Wood Ashes.=--Wood ashes is rich in potash, and is particularly\r\nvaluable with potatoes, fruits of all kinds, etc. But it is a great\r\nerror to mix wood ashes with fresh manure of any kind, especially with\r\nhen manure, as the escape of ammonia is hastened and much value is lost.\r\n\r\n=Natural and Artificial Manures.=--Where the home supply of manure is\r\ninsufficient for a piece of ground, necessitating the addition of\r\nartificial manure, it is universally conceded to be good practice to\r\nstretch the natural product over the whole tract and then to go over\r\nthe whole tract with an artificial fertilizer.\r\n\r\n=Irrigation.=[A]--In connection with a review of the home sources of\r\nmanure the item of irrigation must not be overlooked, for it is\r\nthoroughly well established that water is a carrier of appreciable\r\namounts of fertilizing materials. In European countries large areas of\r\npasture and mowing lands are fertilized by water alone, the irrigation\r\nbeing regarded as of great value on this account, aside from the fact\r\nthat it supplies moisture to the grass roots. Most streams in the\r\nUnited States contain more or less sewage, and in respect to\r\nirrigation are valuable on that account.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The reader is referred to our new book on this subject.\r\nIt is entitled, \"Irrigation by Cheap Modern Methods.\" See illustration\r\nnext page, also pages 83 and 125.--Johnson & Stokes.]\r\n\r\n=Waste Products.=--Many waste or by-products, available for use as\r\nfertilizers, come from time to time within the reach of the farmer or\r\ngardener, especially to those living near towns or railroads.\r\n\r\nThe average market house, be it said with regret, is none too clean,\r\nand refuse in considerable amounts could be had there for the trouble\r\nof sweeping. Cattle cars often contain several inches of valuable\r\ndroppings, to be had for next to nothing. Street-scrapings are worth\r\nthe trouble of hauling, if the distance is short. The manure lost on\r\nthe highways is very great in amount, and may be worth the cost of\r\ncollection. There will some day be a machine for gathering this manure\r\nfrom the roads by horse-power, as it would amply repay the expense of\r\ndriving such a machine along every much-used highway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Illustration from Johnson & Stokes' New\r\nBook--\"Irrigation by Cheap Modern Methods.\"]\r\n\r\n=Value of Manure.=--Dr. Beal figures the values per ton of the several\r\nfarm-made manures as follows: Hen manure, $7.07; sheep, $3.30; pigs,\r\n$3.29; horses, $2.21; cows, $2.02.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bacteroid Tubercles on Red Clover Root. Drawn from\r\nNature.]\r\n\r\nThese figures are based on the assumption that the animals are well\r\nfed, and that no leaching of the manure is allowed, with gypsum used\r\nas a preservative, and good care exercised in all respects. It must\r\nnot be supposed that all manure has such value, or that any manure\r\nwill retain such value under careless treatment.\r\n\r\n=Green Manuring.=--The system of green manuring, as formerly\r\nunderstood and practiced, had two purposes in view. One was to supply\r\nthe soil with needed humus; the other to furnish winter protection and\r\nprevent washing. The practice is a very old one and has much to\r\ncommend it. Not only do plant roots draw up fertility from\r\nconsiderable depths, to be afterward deposited in the superficial soil\r\nwhen the growing crop is turned down by the plow, but the process\r\nfavors chemical changes in the soil by the admission of air and\r\nsunlight and by the decomposition of leaves, stems and roots. But\r\nnothing whatever in the way of new fertility is added by turning down\r\na rye crop, for instance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crimson or Scarlet Clover, a Nitrogen Gatherer.]\r\n\r\n=Cultivating the Legumes.=--The present system of green manuring\r\ncontemplates something in addition to what was formerly gained, for\r\nagricultural sciences now recognizes the fact that nitrogen, the most\r\nexpensive element of fertility, can be taken from the air and added to\r\nthe plant food in the soil by means of certain plants which have the\r\npeculiar habit of regularly forming little tubercles or lumps on their\r\nfeeding roots. These lumps are to be found on plants in perfect\r\nhealth, and are not parasitical in any hostile sense. The lumps are\r\nfilled with small living organisms called bacteria, and, hence, have\r\nbeen called bacteroid tubercles. The minute tenants slowly but surely\r\nsecrete nitrogen, and put it in a form adapted to plant growth.\r\n\r\nThe plants which bear these root lumps belong to a group called legumes,\r\nof which clover, peas, beans, vetches, etc., are familiar examples.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, nearly all the leguminous plants are thus fitted by\r\nnature by means of the root lumps to act as soil enrichers, and these\r\nplants have, therefore, assumed the highest agricultural significance.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that such crops as cowpeas, crimson or scarlet\r\nclover, common red and pea vine or sapling clover, Soja beans,\r\nvetches, etc., can be used to add nitrogen to the soil in commercial\r\nquantities. The gain of new material, expressed in money, has been\r\nestimated as high as $25 per acre. This, therefore, is the avenue\r\nthrough which the farmer can most economically supply nitrogen to his\r\nland. If he will exercise all the economy heretofore suggested in the\r\ncare of natural manures, and will grow legumes, he will not have much\r\noccasion to buy nitrogen in the market.\r\n\r\n=Grass vs. Clover.=--An idea of the great fertilizing value of the\r\nleguminous plants as compared with grasses may be obtained by a study\r\nof the following analyses from U. S. Farmers' Bulletin No. 16, by Dr.\r\nE. W. Allen, on \"Leguminous Plants for Green Manuring and for Feeding\":\r\n\r\n                                    Fertilizing Value in Crop.\r\n                        Assumed              Per Acre.\r\n                         Yield.\r\n                        Per Acre. Nitrogen. Phos. Acid. Potash.\r\n\r\n        Hay from          Tons.    Pounds.    Pounds.   Pounds.\r\n    Red top (a grass)       2       23.0        7.2      20.4\r\n    Timothy (a grass)       2       25.2       10.6      18.0\r\n    Red Clover (a legume)   3       62.1       11.4      66.0\r\n    Alfalfa (a legume)      3       65.7       15.3      50.4\r\n    Cowpea (a legume)       3       58.5       15.6      44.1\r\n    Soja bean (a legume)    3       69.6       20.1      32.4\r\n\r\n=Nitrogen, Phosphoric Acid, Potash.=--We have just noted the cheapest\r\nsource of nitrogen. It can be collected by root tubercles at less than\r\nthe commercial rate of 14 to 17 cents per pound.\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid can be best secured, if a new supply becomes\r\nnecessary, in the form of ground bone or in the form of acid\r\nphosphate. Either of these articles, if bought from a reliable dealer,\r\nis a good and economical thing to use.\r\n\r\nPotash is to be had most cheaply, perhaps, in the manner suggested\r\nheretofore: by the use of kainit as a preserver of stable manure. The\r\nkainit performs a double purpose if used in that way, and thus gets\r\nupon the land in a cheap manner.\r\n\r\nMuriate of potash and sulphate of potash are high-priced articles, but\r\nwhen bought from good houses are fully worth the money they cost.\r\nExcept for the use of kainit, just mentioned, the muriate or sulphate\r\nwould be the more economical form.\r\n\r\nPotash or phosphoric acid (or both), as may be determined by\r\ncircumstances, are needed to aid crimson clover in its growth, and\r\nwith the clover form a perfect manure.\r\n\r\nBarnyard manure is a perfect fertilizer, especially when preserved with\r\nkainit or acid phosphate; and a leguminous crop, if stimulated with\r\nphosphoric acid and potash, leaves the land in fine cropping condition.\r\n\r\n=Value of Green Manures.=--The cash value of green manuring is\r\nsomewhat a matter of location. On light, sandy soils it will be found\r\nwise to turn the whole crop under with the plow, while on heavy loams\r\nthis plan is of doubtful benefit. On the latter land it is conceded to\r\nbe better practice to harvest the crop and feed it to stock, and\r\nreturn the resulting manure to the land.\r\n\r\n=Maximum Amounts of Manures.=--Nobody has yet ventured to fix the\r\nmaximum amounts of natural or artificial manures that soils will bear,\r\nbut these amounts are great. Reference has already been made to the\r\nnumber of tons of stable manure per acre used respectively by market\r\ngardeners and farmers in America. As to commercial fertilizers, the\r\nquantity has been pushed up to two tons per acre, with enormous crops in\r\nconsequence, and with no bad results where the constituent of the\r\nfertilizer were well balanced and where the water-supply was ample. It\r\nis quite easy, however, to scorch or burn the foliage of growing plants\r\nby the improper use of acid fertilizers in dry weather. Of course, no\r\nsuch amount as two tons per acre would be used in ordinary farming or\r\nfarm gardening, but only in certain intense cultural operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCHOICE OF LOCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost every farm has a choice spot for a garden, some favored\r\nlocation where the soil is warm and mellow, and where, perhaps,\r\nshelter is afforded by hill or woodland. Such a spot, especially if it\r\ncan be artificially irrigated, is capable of great things in the way\r\nof growing truck.\r\n\r\nThe place of all others, if it can be had, is a rich meadow bank, on\r\nground low enough for gravity irrigation and yet high enough to be out\r\nof the way of floods. Such a location is by no means rare. There are\r\ncountless acres fulfilling these conditions, and every acre thus\r\nsituated is capable of yielding in vegetables twenty-fold its value as\r\npasturage.\r\n\r\nSuch a meadow needs a few lines of underdrains and an irrigating ditch\r\nalong the highest feasible level. Deep plowing of low land will rarely\r\nbring up the sub-soil, and, after a good coat of lime, the application\r\nof manure may be carried to almost any extent, with good results\r\nassured in advance.\r\n\r\nIf a meadow is not available, the farm gardener will do the next best\r\nthing, whatever that may be, in choosing a place for vegetables,\r\ntrusting the rainfall and depending on manure and good tillage for\r\nsatisfactory crops.\r\n\r\n=As to Growing.=--The one point to be emphasized about the production\r\nof truck for market is that quick growth is necessary for quality,\r\nand, hence, for profits. Good soil, good cultivation and sufficient\r\nmoisture are the essentials for rapid growth.\r\n\r\n=As to Marketing.=--A point of prime importance for all producers to\r\nremember is that price is largely a matter of taste and fancy. If the\r\nconsumer can be attracted by the good appearance of vegetables or fruit,\r\na sale is certain to be made. It will pay handsomely to keep at home all\r\nmedium or second-quality stuff, offering nothing but the best for sale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Reproduction of a Photograph taken in Dock Street\r\nWholesale Market, Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\nIn the great wholesale and retail markets of Philadelphia, New York\r\nand Boston good stuff always moves quickly at fair prices, while poor\r\nstuff begs for buyers at rates yielding no profit to anybody. The\r\nwholesaler is frequently blamed for failure to obtain good prices when\r\nthe fault is really with the producer, and is chargeable to poor stuff\r\nor poor packing.\r\n\r\nThere is a good business opening everywhere for truckers who will ship\r\nonly first-class stuff in new packages. Such produce reaches what is\r\nknown as the fancy trade, and there is more than a living in it for\r\nenterprising growers.\r\n\r\nTruckers who rush their stuff to market in an unwashed, unsorted\r\ncondition, in old or unclean baskets or boxes, may make expenses out\r\nof the business, but they will never do much more. There is a premium\r\non quality and appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLES SUITED TO FARM CULTURE EVERYWHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loading the Market Wagon.]\r\n\r\nIn this chapter are grouped a number of vegetables of easy culture. They\r\nmay be grown with success almost anywhere. Some of them are produced by\r\nmarket gardeners, but by reason of the amount of ground which they\r\noccupy they are more particularly adapted to horse culture by farmers.\r\n\r\nThe chapter will treat briefly of asparagus, beans, beets, cabbage,\r\ncarrots, sweet corn, horseradish, parsnip, potato, pumpkin and squash,\r\nsalsify, tomato, turnip, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS.\r\n\r\nAsparagus demands a deep, rich, well-drained soil. Its culture is\r\nprofitable, and it yields ready cash at an early season of the year,\r\nwhen other sales are limited. The cutting term covers six weeks,\r\nbeginning (at Philadelphia) in the middle or latter part of April.\r\nCutting must here cease in June, in order to give the roots ample time\r\nto regain strength and make vigorous tops. The gross product per acre,\r\nnear Philadelphia, expressed in money, is, perhaps, $200 at this time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Donald's Elmira.]\r\n\r\nIn selecting a situation for a bed, a warm spot should be chosen,\r\nhaving a deep and mellow soil, and with good natural or artificial\r\ndrainage. A small area is better than a large one, as being more\r\nlikely to receive sufficient manure; and it is desirable that the land\r\nshould have been tilled for a year or two before the planting of the\r\nroots, and a heavy coat of manure incorporated with the soil--the more\r\nmanure the better.\r\n\r\n=Roots.=--The roots are set in early spring, in deep trenches, 5 or 6\r\nfeet apart, made with a plow. If the plow be run both ways and the\r\nloose dirt shovelled out, it is quite easy to reach a depth of 15 or\r\nmore inches. It is not material whether strong one-year-old roots or\r\ntwo-year-old roots be used.\r\n\r\n=Varieties.=--As to varieties, it is almost as much a matter of\r\nculture as of name; still, there are better and worse kinds. Asparagus\r\nvaries in color from purple to green, and even to white. There are\r\ncertain so-called mammoth sorts, whose shoots are larger, but less\r\nnumerous than the old-fashioned kinds. There is a slight difference in\r\nflavor, also, but the preference of the local market must determine\r\nthe farmer in making a choice of roots. If a green \"grass\" be\r\npreferred, that kind can be had from seedsmen; but, no matter how\r\ncarefully the roots may be grown, there will be some slight variations\r\nin the color of the shoots, for asparagus does not always come true\r\nfrom seed. Market gardeners usually sort their asparagus shoots at\r\nbunching time; always for size, and sometimes for color, especially\r\nwhen supplying a fancy trade.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, it is wise to select a variety that will produce a good\r\nnumber of large-sized shoots, such as Donald's Elmira or Barr's Mammoth,\r\nand trust to manure and culture for the best results. Quality of shoots\r\ndepends on quick growth, and size depends somewhat on distance of the\r\nroot under ground. The deeper the asparagus root under the surface, the\r\nlarger in diameter will be the shoot, provided the plants are not\r\ncrowded; a fact of which gardeners often take advantage by heaping soil\r\nup over the crowns of the plants during the growing season.\r\n\r\n     ASPARAGUS.--Donald's Elmira is one of the best for the North.\r\n     Palmetto is the asparagus generally grown in the South. For\r\n     descriptions, see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n=Setting out.=--The young roots should be set carefully, crowns up, at\r\nintervals of 1-1/2 to 2 feet, in the deep furrows or trenches\r\nheretofore mentioned. A few inches of manure can be put in the bottom,\r\ncovering slightly with soil and about 6 inches of soil put upon them.\r\nThe spaces between the rows may be cultivated during the first year,\r\nand some quick crop grown there. The working of this crop will\r\ngradually fill up the furrows about the stems of the young asparagus,\r\nwhich, during the first year, is quite small and insignificant in\r\nappearance. By fall, the furrows will be entirely filled and the\r\nsurface of the patch level. The asparagus slug, the larva of the\r\nwell-known beetle, may be kept down by occasionally dusting with\r\nslacked lime containing Paris green. The following year the asparagus\r\nwill show up to some advantage, but should not be cut. The third year\r\n(second after planting) will yield some marketable shoots; but cutting\r\nshould not continue more than two or three weeks. The fourth year the\r\nbed may be said to be in full bearing.\r\n\r\n=Treatment.=--The spring treatment of an asparagus bed in profit\r\nbegins with a light plowing parallel with the rows, great care being\r\nobserved to use a wheel on the plow so that not more than a few inches\r\nof soil may be turned, lest the crowns be cut and injured. The bed\r\nthen lies until the cutting season is well advanced, when the plow may\r\nbe again used.\r\n\r\nThe first plowing was merely to break the surface of the ground and\r\nturn under the winter coat of manure, leaving the land level. The\r\nsecond plowing (if given) is to be toward the rows, for the purpose of\r\nthrowing them further under the surface, so as to get larger shoots as\r\nwarm weather advances.\r\n\r\nAnother plowing, very shallow, followed by harrow or cultivator,\r\nshould be given at the end of the cutting season, in June, to destroy\r\nall weeds and to encourage summer growth of the asparagus.\r\n\r\nThe patch should be kept clear of weeds during the summer, and growth\r\nencouraged by cultivation. In the late autumn the tops are mowed off and\r\nburned, as there seems to be no economic way of composting them, for, if\r\nmoved to the compost heap or barnyard, they will seed the whole farm\r\nwith asparagus. There should be a good coat of manure for winter\r\nprotection, to be turned under in early spring, as already mentioned.\r\n\r\n=Marketing.=--The preparation of the crop for market involves some\r\ntime and trouble. The shoots are cut every day. Some growers do the\r\nwork early in the morning, and carry the bunches to market the same\r\nday. Others cut and bunch one day, put in water over night and carry\r\nto market the following day. Circumstances must decide which is best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Acme Asparagus Buncher, with Knife Guard.]\r\n\r\nIf asparagus is to be shipped long distances, it must either be packed\r\nin open crates (like strawberry crates), or else thoroughly chilled\r\nby ice before starting. Otherwise, it will heat and spoil. The usual\r\nasparagus bunch is just about the size of a dry-measure quart in\r\ndiameter, and from 6 to 9 inches in length. In fact, a quart cup or\r\ntin fruit can is frequently used in shaping the bunch. Home-made\r\nwooden bunchers are also in common use. The Acme asparagus buncher is\r\nthe best, coming in two sizes. The asparagus is tied in two places\r\nwith raphia or soft string, and thus makes a neat and attractive\r\npackage. The butts are cut off square with a knife after the bunch is\r\nfinished, and in this shape asparagus will remain fresh for a long\r\ntime, if kept standing in shallow water.\r\n\r\nIn tying up the bunches the shoots are separated into two or three\r\nsizes. The small shoots are quite as good for food as the larger ones,\r\nbut the latter always bring more money in market, which warrants the\r\nadditional trouble involved.\r\n\r\n=Salt.=--Salt is frequently used on asparagus beds, but not always.\r\nSalt is sometimes an indirect fertilizer, acting upon fertility\r\nalready in the soil, and having a distinct tendency to attract and\r\nhold moisture, but it has no direct fertilizing influence. It has a\r\nbeneficial effect in helping to check the growth of weeds.\r\n\r\n=Fertilizers.=--Kainit is an excellent thing for asparagus beds, as\r\nit contains a considerable percentage of sulphate of potash, which is\r\na direct fertilizer. It also contains a fourth of its bulk of salt.\r\nGround bone, which contains nitrogen (ammonia) and phosphoric acid, is\r\nalso a good thing to use on asparagus. It is very lasting in its\r\naction, and with the kainit makes a complete manure, especially in\r\nconnection with the winter coat of stable manure.\r\n\r\nAsparagus is a gross feeder, and will take almost any amount of\r\nfertilizer. Market gardeners, who raise the most and best asparagus,\r\ndepend mainly on enormous quantities of first-class stable manure; and\r\nthis is probably the best fertilizer of all for this succulent and\r\nvaluable vegetable.\r\n\r\n=Tools.=--No special tools are demanded in asparagus culture, though\r\nsuch tools are on the market. Any long knife will do for cutting the\r\nshoots, although a very good knife is especially made of solid steel,\r\nand can be bought for 25 cents. The cut should be made just below the\r\nsurface of the ground, care being taken not to injure other shoots just\r\ncoming up. Crooked shoots often make their appearance, resulting from\r\ninjury done by the cutting knife. Other causes, such as insects, hard\r\nsoil, etc., produce crooked or deformed shoots. Asparagus bunchers, made\r\nof wood and metal, mentioned in the seed catalogues, are sometimes used,\r\nthe Acme, heretofore referred to, being the best and cheapest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Solid Steel Asparagus Knife.]\r\n\r\nAny light plow with a wheel will answer for the asparagus bed. A\r\nlight-weight harrow is also desirable. Where asparagus trenches are\r\nlaid out and dug by hand of course a garden line must be used, in\r\norder to have them straight and uniform. The practice of digging deep\r\ntrenches for asparagus still prevails to some extent in private\r\ngardens, but the farm gardener must use cheaper methods.\r\n\r\n=Roots per Acre.=--With rows 5 feet apart and plants 2 feet apart in the\r\nrows, it is evident that each plant represents just 10 square feet of\r\nspace. Hence, about 5,000 asparagus plants would be required for an acre\r\nof land set at these distances; they are, however, often set closer than\r\nthis, sometimes at the rate of 7,000 roots and over per acre. An\r\nasparagus bed containing 100 roots will supply an ordinary family.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEANS.\r\n\r\nBean-growing in a small way is fully warranted in every garden, but on\r\na large scale it is a different question, being somewhat a matter of\r\nsoil and location.\r\n\r\n=Food Value.=--The bean is one of the most excellent of human foods.\r\nIts botanical kinship is close to the pea, and both are legumes. The\r\nleguminous plants, it will be remembered, have the rare ability of\r\nobtaining nitrogen through the tubercles on their roots, taking this\r\nexpensive element partly from the air, and not greatly impoverishing\r\nthe soil by their growth.\r\n\r\nSomething of the food value of the bean may be learned by comparing\r\nits chemical analysis with that of beef. In 100 pounds of beans there\r\nare 23 pounds of protein (nitrogenous matter), while in 100 pounds of\r\nbeef there are but about 15 to 20 pounds of protein. Peas are almost\r\nas rich as beans in protein, which is the tissue-building element of\r\nall foods, and, hence, it is easy to realize the fact that both beans\r\nand peas are foods of the highest economic value. They are standard\r\nfoods of the world, entering into the diet of soldiers, laborers and\r\npersons needing physical strength.\r\n\r\nIt is generally safe to grow beans for the retail market of any town\r\nor centre of population, but to compete in the open wholesale market\r\ndemands experience and good equipment on the part of the grower to\r\ninsure profits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Improved Round Green Pod Extra Early Valentine Bean.]\r\n\r\n=Varieties and Types.=--The varieties of beans are well-nigh endless.\r\nSome demand poles, while some are dwarf, being called bush beans. The\r\ninfluence of man has developed the bean into a vast number of different\r\nforms, which frequently show a disposition to revert or go back to some\r\nancestral type, no matter how carefully the seeds may be kept.\r\n\r\nThe pole beans, in general terms, yield larger crops and bear through\r\na longer season than the bush beans. The green-podded beans, as a\r\nrule, are more prolific and more hardy than the yellow-podded or wax\r\nbeans. The climbers demand a whole season, and bear until frost. The\r\nbush beans are mostly employed where two or more crops are demanded\r\nper year from the ground.\r\n\r\nThe so-called cut-short or snap-short beans are those in which the\r\nwhole pod, in its green state, is used for food. They are of both\r\ntypes, climbing and bush. The Lima forms include a number of distinct\r\nbeans, differing greatly in size and shape and also in habit of growth.\r\n\r\n     BUSH BEANS (green pod).--We recommend Improved Round Pod Extra\r\n     Early Valentine; also, New Giant Stringless Valentine.\r\n\r\n     BUSH BEANS (yellow pod).--Wardwell's Kidney Wax and Davis' White\r\n     Wax are largely grown in the South for shipment North. Valentine\r\n     Wax is recommended for the North. For descriptions, see \"Johnson\r\n     & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n     WHITE FIELD OR SOUP BEANS.--We recommend Day's Leafless Medium\r\n     and New Snowflake Field. For descriptions of these and other\r\n     varieties, see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n     POLE LIMA BEANS.--We especially recommend Ford's Mammoth Podded\r\n     Lima and Siebert's Early Lima.\r\n\r\n     POLE SNAP BEANS.--Golden Andalusia Wax is one of the best\r\n     yellow-pod pole beans, and Lazy Wife's one of the best green-pod\r\n     sorts.\r\n\r\n     DWARF LIMA.--Dreer's, Burpee's and Henderson's represent three\r\n     distinct types.\r\n\r\n     For full descriptions of beans, see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and\r\n     Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n=Location.=--In choosing a spot for bean culture the farm gardener\r\nshould select good mellow soil that has been manured the previous\r\nyear. Fresh manure produces an excessive growth of vine at the expense\r\nof pods.\r\n\r\n=Making Ready.=--Much stable manure, which is rich in nitrogen, should\r\nbe avoided. In good ordinary soil, with some rotted manure from the\r\nprevious crop, the bean plant will do well. It will obtain nitrogen,\r\nin great part, from the air, as already explained. Old manure is very\r\nfavorable as a starter, as it contains the minute organisms mentioned\r\nin the preceding pages. Complete fertilizers or those containing\r\nphosphoric acid and potash must be supplied. Only nitrogen is derived\r\nfrom the air.\r\n\r\n=Soil Inoculation.=--The soil of a new bean patch is sometimes\r\ninoculated with soil from an old patch, to get quick action of the\r\nbacteria (little organisms), which form the lumps or tubercles on the\r\nroots. The scattering of a little soil over the surface is all that is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to avoid the transfer of soil for this purpose\r\nfrom a patch affected with rust or blight, as diseases are carried\r\nfrom place to place with only too much ease.\r\n\r\n=When to Plant.=--Beans may safely be planted when the apple is in\r\nbloom, in May; not so early as peas, as beans are less hardy. The ground\r\nshould be dry and warm. Beans of all kinds demand shallow planting, as\r\nthe seeds must be lifted from the ground in the earliest process of\r\ngrowth. The seed swells, bursts, sends a shoot (radicle) downward, and\r\nthe two parts of the seed, called the seed-leaves, are pushed up into\r\nthe daylight. Small round beans can take care of themselves, as they\r\nturn easily in the soil, but lima beans often perish in the effort to\r\nget above ground. This is why lima beans should always be planted eye\r\ndown, and less than an inch deep. A half inch is deep enough for most\r\nbeans. If lima beans are wanted extra early, they should be started on\r\nsmall squares of inverted sod, under glass.\r\n\r\nThe earliest bush beans yield marketable pods within forty to fifty days\r\nfrom planting; the pole beans in from seventy to ninety days from\r\nplanting. There should be successional plantings made of the bush beans\r\nfrom the first date to within fifty days of frost. The different types\r\nof beans are fully and carefully described in the seed catalogues.\r\n\r\n=Distances.=--Poles for beans should be set about 4 feet apart each\r\nway; or, in single rows, about 3 feet apart. Not more than three or\r\nfour plants should be allowed to a hill. Wires stretched between\r\nposts, with strings down to the ground, are sometimes used. The bush\r\nbeans are planted in rows 3 feet apart for horse culture, or half that\r\ndistance where a hoe or hand cultivator is to be used. The plants in\r\nthe rows should stand 3 or 4 inches apart for best yield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plant of the New Valentine Wax Bean. The Earliest Wax\r\nor Yellow Podded Snap Short.]\r\n\r\n=On a Large Scale.=--In large field operations, where the dried bean\r\nis the object in view, a clover sod is a favorite location. The ground\r\nis enriched by 400 or 500 pounds of complete fertilizer, and the beans\r\nare planted with a grain drill, using every fourth tube. The culture\r\nis by horse-power, and the vines are pulled by hand or by means of a\r\nbean-harvester, and threshed with a flail or grain thresher. These\r\nwhite grocery beans are sold everywhere in large quantities.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation.=--All bean cultivation should be shallow. Nothing is\r\ngained by cutting the feeding roots. The climbing sorts twine \"against\r\nthe sun;\" that is, in a contrary direction to the apparent motion of\r\nthe sun. The shoots must be tied up several times, to keep them on\r\ntheir own poles.\r\n\r\n=Diseases.=--The worst bean enemies are rust and blight. In new soil,\r\nwith good weather, these troubles seldom appear. During prolonged wet\r\nweather there seems to be no help for them. Spraying with Bordeaux\r\nmixture is a preventive. The spraying should be done in advance of\r\nblossoming. The seed is sometimes soaked in Bordeaux mixture for an\r\nhour where rust is anticipated. Prevention is better than cure, and\r\nnew soil and fresh seed are the best precautions. Diseased vines\r\nshould be burned.\r\n\r\n=Insects.=--The weevil which attacks the bean is closely allied to the\r\npea weevil. Some practical people say there is no remedy known; others\r\nrecommend heating the beans to 145 deg. for an hour; others use bisulphide\r\nof carbon in a closed vessel, along with the beans.\r\n\r\n=Profits.=--By far the largest cash receipts per acre are obtained by\r\nselling beans in their fresh state; preferably in the pods. The\r\nproduction of bush beans (pods) may run up to 75 or 80 bushels per acre,\r\nor even more. Lima beans are more profitably sold in the pods than\r\nshelled, though some markets demand the shelled article. The consumer\r\ngets a fresher and better article in the pods, and the producer is\r\nsaved much trouble, and this method should be encouraged. Beans should\r\nbe cooled, if possible, before shipment in bulk to distant markets, thus\r\navoiding danger from heating, moulding and spotting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEETS.\r\n\r\nBeets are produced in enormous quantities by market gardeners near all\r\nlarge cities, both under glass and in the open ground. They also have\r\na place in the farm garden, as they are of easy culture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crosby's Improved Egyptian, the Earliest Blood Turnip\r\nBeet.]\r\n\r\nExcellence in the table beet depends partly on variety, but mainly on\r\nthe quickness of growth. Sweetness and succulence result from high\r\nculture in rich, mellow soil.\r\n\r\nMangels and sugar beets, of course, have a place on every farm, for\r\nstock-feeding purposes, and table beets may also be grown, if good soil\r\nis available, for market purposes. The winter-keeping sorts are\r\nfrequently in demand, and may be included among the farmer's cash crops.\r\n\r\nNo amount of stable manure is excessive in beet-growing. Partially\r\nrotted manure is best. For horse culture the rows should be 3 feet\r\napart. Five to six pounds of seed will plant an acre.\r\n\r\nPLANTING.--Planting may be done as soon as the ground can be worked in\r\nthe spring, as the beet is hardy, and not injured by a little frost;\r\nand successional plantings may be made until June. The June sowing\r\nwill produce autumn beets, which can be stored for winter use or sale.\r\n\r\nIt is well to soak the seed in tepid water before planting; it should\r\nbe scattered thinly in the rows and lightly covered. In dry weather\r\nthe soil must be pressed firmly on the seed, to insure sufficient\r\nmoisture for germination. The plants in the rows should be thinned out\r\nto 3 or 4 inches.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to remember that the more space each plant has\r\nabout it the sooner will it reach a marketable size. Beet plants\r\nstanding 5 inches apart in the row will be ready long before plants\r\nstanding only 2 inches apart.\r\n\r\nBeets vary in shape very considerably. Some are round and some are\r\nlong, with intermediate grades. The turnip-shaped beets are the\r\nearliest, while the half-longs and longs are the heaviest. For market\r\npurposes, if sold in bunches, the round ones are the most profitable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ford's Perfected Half-long Beet. The Best Winter Keeper.]\r\n\r\nThe color of the foliage varies greatly; but the color of the leaf is\r\nnot always typical of the root. Some of the blood beets have green\r\nleaves. There are many shades and colors of the roots, from deepest\r\nblood red to white, with zones of pink. The beet is an excellent and\r\nhighly esteemed article of food, and is always in demand.\r\n\r\n     BEETS.--For earliest, we especially recommend Crosby's Improved\r\n     Egyptian and Surprise; for winter, Ford's Perfected Half-Long.\r\n     Please see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n=Marketing and Storing.=--A bunch contains five, six or seven beets,\r\nwith tops tied together and superfluous leaves cut off. The bunching\r\nand topping may be done in the field, and the bunches afterward washed\r\nin a tub of water, by means of a scrubbing brush. It always pays to\r\nsend roots to market in a clean and attractive condition.\r\n\r\nWinter storage in cellars, under sand, is often practiced; or the beets\r\nmay be kept in pits in the open ground, covered with straw and earth.\r\n\r\n=Enemies.=--The beet is remarkably free from enemies of any kind. The\r\nroot sometimes cracks, and is occasionally attacked by insects, but\r\nthe farmer or gardener has little to fear if soil be good and weather\r\nbe favorable. All farmers attending market should have a few beets to\r\nhelp make up the weekly load for the wagon.\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGE.\r\n\r\nEarly cabbage is not a farm gardener's crop at the North, though in\r\nthe Southern States the early varieties can be grown by farmers for\r\nshipment to the great Northern markets. The Northern farmer, unless\r\nprovided with glass, usually finds more profit in the later and\r\nlarger sorts, which mature in autumn.\r\n\r\n=Soil.=--Rich, loamy soil, containing much clay, is best for this\r\nvegetable, which is a rank feeder. Large amounts of manure are\r\ndemanded. The manure is best applied in a partially rotted form, as\r\nfresh manure of any kind (especially hog manure) is liable to produce\r\nthe disease or deformity known as club-root, the spores of the disease\r\napparently being in the fresh manure; though land too long cropped\r\nwith cabbage is likely to produce the same disease without the\r\napplication of fresh manure of any kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Early Jersey Wakefield Cabbage.]\r\n\r\n=Seed.=--It is of especial importance that good seed be planted, as\r\ncabbage varies so much and shows such a disposition to go back to\r\nundesirable types that great dissatisfaction and loss attend all\r\nexperiments with poorly-selected seed. The choice of seed not\r\ninfrequently determines the size and success of the crop. Expert\r\ncabbage growers are well aware of this fact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Johnson & Stokes 'Market Gardeners' No. 2, Valuable for\r\nEarly Summer or Winter Cabbage.]\r\n\r\n=Planting.=--The manure should be broadcasted, and an ample amount\r\nused, with a high-grade fertilizer in the row. The young plants,\r\npreviously started in a seed-bed, should (at the North) be set out in\r\nJuly. The seed for late cabbage is planted in May. A quarter pound of\r\nseed will give enough plants for an acre.\r\n\r\nThe rows should be 4 feet apart, and the plants 2-1/2 feet apart in\r\nthe rows. These distances favor good cultivation and quick growth. In\r\nsome parts of New England the seed is sown in the open field, in rows\r\nwhere the cabbage is to grow, but the practice of transplanting from\r\nseedbeds is found most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe rainfall here usually insures a fair crop of cabbage, but any crop\r\nwhich requires transplanting in midsummer is liable to delay or injury\r\nin case of protracted dry weather. Hence, irrigation is desirable. At\r\nthe distances just recommended for planting (4 x 2-1/2 feet) there\r\nwould be 4,356 plants to the acre. In the case of such varieties as\r\nJohnson & Stokes' Earliest and Jersey Wakefield cabbage, where the\r\nnumber of plants per acre would be perhaps 10,000, the Michigan\r\nExperiment Station obtained 5,000 more marketable heads per acre under\r\nirrigation than where water was not used upon the growing crop. (This\r\nfact is mentioned in a book on irrigation just issued by the\r\npublishers of this book).\r\n\r\n=Varieties.=--The earliest varieties of cabbage have small, conical\r\nheads; the midsummer sorts mostly round heads; and the late or\r\ndrumhead sorts have large, flat heads. There are cabbages which never\r\nhead; as, for instance, the collards of the South; and there are\r\nvarieties of crinkled-leaf cabbages, known as the Savoy types. The\r\nkales are closely related to the cabbages. Both cabbages and kales\r\nhave purple-colored forms, sometimes called red forms.\r\n\r\n     CABBAGE.--For early varieties for the South, we recommend Johnson\r\n     & Stokes' Earliest, Early Jersey Wakefield and Charleston\r\n     Wakefield; for both early and late in the North, Johnson &\r\n     Stokes' Market Gardeners' No. 2, Louderback's All the Year Round;\r\n     for late varieties for the North, New Rock Head Winter, Johnson &\r\n     Stokes' Matchless Flat Dutch, Danish Ball Head. The Johnson &\r\n     Stokes' Hard Heading Savoy Cabbage is of rare excellence. For\r\n     descriptions of the many varieties of cabbage, please see\r\n     \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n=Cultivation.=--Thorough horse cultivation between the rows should be\r\nsupplemented by a hand-hoe between the plants in the rows. The\r\ncultivation must be good and continuous until the heads begin to form.\r\n\r\n=Diseases and Insects Enemies.=--Club root has been mentioned. It is a\r\nfungous trouble. The best remedy is new ground. The black flea on very\r\nyoung plants can be conquered with air-slacked lime or wood ashes. The\r\ncut worm is troublesome only in spring; not with late cabbage. The\r\nroot maggot is sometimes very destructive, both with cabbage and\r\ncauliflower. New ground is the most satisfactory remedy. Green aphides\r\nor lice often follow lack of strength in the cabbage. Pyrethrum\r\npowder, air-slacked lime, kerosene emulsion, etc., are used as\r\nremedies for lice. The pyrethrum may be used dry or in water, at the\r\nrate of a tablespoonful to two gallons. The green cabbage worm, one of\r\nthe worst of all enemies, can be pretty effectually checked by means\r\nof air-slaked lime dusted over the leaves. Other caterpillars yield to\r\nthe same treatment.\r\n\r\n=Bursting.=--Bursting of cabbage heads is caused by a second growth,\r\nthe result, perhaps, of continued wet weather, or warm weather\r\nfollowing cold weather. The best remedy is to cut part of the feeding\r\nroots, either by close cultivation or with a hoe.\r\n\r\n=Selling.=--Cabbage prices vary between extremes that are far\r\nseparated. Early cabbage usually sells at a good profit. Summer and\r\nautumn prices may be low. Winter and spring prices are almost always\r\nfair, and occasionally extra. Pennsylvania farmers sometimes ship to\r\nwholesalers in the cities and sometimes sell at public sale in the\r\nopen field, in the autumn, just as the crop stands. The latter plan is\r\nan excellent one, where auction prices warrant it. It avoids the cost\r\nand risk of storage, as each buyer removes and stores his purchase.\r\n\r\n=Storage.=--Cabbage will bear much freezing without injury. The art of\r\nwinter storage is to put it where it will have the fewest changes of\r\ntemperature, and where it will be cool and damp without being wet.\r\n\r\nThe most common practice is to cover two or three rows of inverted\r\nheads, with roots attached, with from 6 to 12 inches of soil, making\r\nprovision for good drainage by ditches on both sides of the\r\nwedge-shaped heap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cutting Johnson & Stokes' Earliest Cabbage for Market.\r\nPhotographed June 1st, in the Field of Messrs. Myers & Bowman, the\r\nwell-known Philadelphia Market Gardeners. This was the first\r\nHome-grown Cabbage in Philadelphia Markets.]\r\n\r\nThis system may be modified so as to include six or more rows of\r\ninverted cabbage, the heap being flat instead of wedge-shaped on top.\r\nIt does not turn water so well, but in practice is usually\r\nsatisfactory. A good plan is to use about 6 inches of soil, and to add\r\nstraw or litter as the cold increases.\r\n\r\nUnder a steady low temperature it is no trouble to keep cabbage\r\nthrough the winter, but it is hard to provide against the many changes\r\nof our variable climate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Johnson & Stokes' Matchless Late Flat Dutch Cabbage.]\r\n\r\nWhere heads are to be carried over for seed, or where it is intended\r\nto head up soft cabbages during the winter (a feasible thing) the\r\nroots are set downward instead of upward. If care be taken to remove\r\nthe roots without much injury, they may be set in furrows or trenches,\r\nand the earth heaped over the cabbages just as in the several ways\r\nabove mentioned, and they will make decided growth during their life\r\nunder ground. In fact, a cabbage with any sort of immature head in\r\nNovember will, under proper management, be in good marketable\r\ncondition in March or April.\r\n\r\nSolid freezing in the trenches is not necessarily destructive, but if\r\nthe temperature falls much below 15 deg. (at the point occupied by the\r\nheads), there is danger that they will perish. They may be in good\r\nedible condition after such severe freezing, but the chances are that\r\nthey will fail to grow if set out for seed. The cabbage decays with a\r\nstrong, offensive smell when its tissues finally break down after\r\nrepeated changes of temperature and moisture. A uniform temperature is\r\nfavored by the use of earth in storage, and though storage in\r\nbuildings and cellars is quite feasible, there is nothing better or\r\ncheaper than the soil of the open field.\r\n\r\nIf the crop is not all to be marketed at one time, it is well to make\r\na number of separate trenches, so that each can be wholly cleared of\r\nits contents at a single opening. These trenches and ridges must be\r\nmade upon dry ground, where there is no standing water.\r\n\r\n=For Stock.=--Cabbages make good food for cows, but should be fed\r\nafter milking; and frozen cabbages should never be fed in any\r\nconsiderable quantity, as they are liable to cause hoven or bloat.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARROTS.\r\n\r\nA sandy soil or light loam is best for carrots, but they will grow\r\nanywhere under good culture. Enormous quantities are grown by the\r\nmarket gardeners, both under glass and in the open ground, for use in\r\nsoups and for seasoning purposes. The short or half-long varieties are\r\ndemanded by this trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Average Specimens of Rubicon Half-Long Carrots.]\r\n\r\nFarm gardeners will do best with half-long and long kinds, unless a\r\nspecial demand calls for the smaller carrots. The large half-long and\r\nlong ones are suited to both culinary and stock-feeding purposes.\r\n\r\nIt requires from three to four pounds of seed to the acre, depending\r\non the distance between the rows. The plants should be from 3 to 5\r\ninches apart in the rows, and the rows as near together as is feasible\r\nfor horse work. Clean culture is demanded. The seed must be planted\r\nshallow, and may go into the ground as early as it can be worked in\r\nthe spring, and from that time until the middle of June. The only\r\ndanger about late planting is the possibility of dry weather.\r\n\r\nThe carrot is quite free from insect or other enemies, as a rule, and\r\nits culture is not difficult. It demands thinning and hoeing after the\r\nplants are well above ground, but no extra attention of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe winter storage is the same as for beets or turnips, either to be\r\nput away in earth-covered heaps or preserved in a cool, non-freezing\r\nroot cellar.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Belgian carrots (both yellow and white) are used only as\r\nstock food; though the other sorts, such as Rubicon, Danvers and Long\r\nOrange, if in excess of market demands, are equally good for stock. Cows\r\nand horses are fond of them, and they are most wholesome. The farm\r\ngardener should raise them, however, for their cash value in the produce\r\nmarkets. The carrot is in high favor with good cooks everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe carrot does not demand excessively rich ground; in fact, too much\r\nmanure tends to stimulate the growth of the top at the expense of the\r\nroot, and fresh manure makes the root rough.\r\n\r\nThe smaller carrots are bunched and sold like radishes or early beets.\r\nThe larger kinds are sold by measure--about 60 cents or more per\r\nbasket at this time (January, 1898). This is at the rate of $1.50 per\r\nbarrel, or about $300 per acre. The crop is a good one, if near a\r\nmarket where carrots are demanded.\r\n\r\n     CARROT.--We especially recommend Rubicon Half-Long for market or\r\n     stock. See \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET CORN.\r\n\r\nThere is no money crop more available to the farm gardener than sweet\r\ncorn. It will grow anywhere, and the young ears are always in demand.\r\nAny sod land plowed shallow will yield a crop of sweet corn. It is\r\neasy in this latitude to have an unbroken succession of marketable\r\nears from July 1st to October 1st, or even somewhat earlier and later.\r\n\r\nShallow plowing and the use of a little fertilizer or compost in the\r\nhills will put the ground in order. A complete fertilizer is best. A\r\ncompost containing hen manure is excellent.\r\n\r\n=Planting.=--Eight or ten quarts of seed are required to plant an acre\r\nof corn in hills, allowing for replanting of what is injured by grubs or\r\nother causes. The larger varieties should be planted 4 feet by 3; the\r\nrows 4 feet apart and the hills 3 feet apart, with not more than three\r\nstalks in a hill. The smaller varieties may be grown much closer--3 feet\r\nby 2. Any method may be used in laying out a corn field that will give\r\neach stalk (of the large kinds) the equivalent of 4 square feet of\r\nground space. The dwarf sweet corns demand about half that space.\r\n\r\n=Varieties.=--The sweet corns require from sixty to eighty days to\r\nproduce ears fit for boiling. The earliest varieties are small, and\r\nare lacking in sweetness as compared to the best intermediate types.\r\nStill, the early prices are so much better than midsummer prices, that\r\nthe early varieties will always be grown for market. Indeed, the best\r\nprofits of the business are from the extra early and extra late sales.\r\n\r\nSweet corn should not be grown by shippers who are distant more than\r\ntwenty-four hours from market, as the ears lose quality and flavor\r\nsoon after being pulled from the stalks. Forty-eight hours from market\r\nis an extreme distance, but is feasible if the ears can be chilled in\r\na cold storage house previous to shipment; otherwise, they will heat\r\nand spoil. Even when designed for a near-by market a load of sweet\r\ncorn ears may heat and spoil during a single night. It is best to\r\nscatter them upon the grass, if pulled during the afternoon for\r\nshipment the following morning.\r\n\r\nThe most profit to the grower will be found in ears which are not too\r\nlarge, as corn is often sold by the dozen, the large sorts being too\r\nweighty.\r\n\r\nThe early kinds, though small, can be planted closely, and a large\r\nnumber of ears secured; and they are out of the way so soon that the\r\nground can be used for celery or other late crop. Celery can be set\r\nout between the rows of corn, and thus be shaded to some extent during\r\nthe critical period following transplanting.\r\n\r\nThe Evergreens, Early and Late, and the shoe-peg types, such as\r\nCountry Gentleman and Zig Zag Evergreen, are among the sweetest of\r\nall. The grains are of irregular shape and arrangement, and the\r\nappearance of the ears is not altogether prepossessing. When once\r\nknown, however, they are in demand by consumers.\r\n\r\nThe red-cob corns should be cooked by dropping into boiling water. If\r\ncooked slowly, the red color of the cob affects the appearance of the\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\n     SWEET CORN.--For first early, we recommend Burlington Hybrid and\r\n     Mammoth White Cory. The former closely resembles a true sugar\r\n     corn in appearance. For second early, Early Champion and New\r\n     Early Evergreen; for late, original Stowell's Evergreen, Country\r\n     Gentleman, Zig Zag Evergreen. See \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and\r\n     Farm Manual\" for descriptions of varieties.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation, Enemies, etc.=--Shallow culture, frequently repeated, is\r\ndemanded by sweet corn. The growth at first is timid and slow;\r\nafterward, if well cultivated, the stalks grow with great rapidity and\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New Early Evergreen Sweet Corn.]\r\n\r\nTo make the most of the stalks, they should be cut as soon as possible\r\nafter the last ears have gone to market and fed to stock. Sweet corn\r\nstalks when dry make excellent fodder.\r\n\r\nThe main enemies of corn are the cut worm, which is only troublesome in\r\nspring; a fungus which attacks the ears and which is always most\r\nprevalent on the small, early sorts; and a worm which cuts and injures\r\nthe grain while the corn is in milk. Crows sometimes pull up the seeds,\r\nbut can be disposed of by scattering a little yellow corn on the surface\r\nof the ground around the edges of the field. As the crow destroys many\r\ncut worms, it is better to feed him with corn than to shoot him.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of fungus-troubled or smutty corn is probably a symptom\r\nof weakness, the result of planting too early, or of too much wet\r\nweather. All plants that are weak are liable to fungus attacks, and it\r\nis the early corn that suffers most. This corn is often planted\r\nbefore the ground is sufficiently warm, and there is a consequent\r\nweakness of growth. Indian corn, at Philadelphia, should not be\r\nplanted before May 10th, and yet it is not uncommon to see gardeners\r\nplanting sweet corn two weeks earlier. They say they are \"going to\r\nrisk it.\" The result may be a good crop of corn, or it may be a crop\r\nof worms and fungus. Of course, the high price of the first corn in\r\nmarket is the excuse for the unseasonable date of planting. But it is\r\nnot quite fair to blame the seed or the variety of corn for what is\r\npartly the result of the gardener's impatience. All traces of smut on\r\ncorn stalks should be burned, and not allowed to be fed to cattle.\r\n\r\n=The Corn Worm.=--Far more destructive and disastrous than smut is the\r\ncorn worm (Heliothis armiger). This is the cotton worm of the South,\r\nthere called boll worm. It is also sometimes called the tomato worm.\r\nIt is the larva of a day-flying moth.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in dealing with it is that when in the corn ear it is\r\nout of the reach of poisonous applications of any kind. Its\r\ndepredations are extensive, especially in early corn. It prefers corn\r\nto all other foods, and cotton planters protect their crops by\r\nplanting early corn in the cotton fields and then destroying the corn\r\nand the worms within the ears.\r\n\r\nThe best remedy at the North is to feed all wormy ears to pigs; and to\r\nplow the corn land in autumn, when the insects are in the pupa or\r\nchrysalis state. If turned up by the plow, it is believed that they\r\nmostly perish. The worms are said to be cannibals, eating each other\r\nto a great extent.\r\n\r\nThis worm is, perhaps, the greatest enemy with which the grower of\r\nsweet corn has to contend. The plan of feeding wormy ears to pigs\r\noffers the double advantage of destroying the enclosed pests, while at\r\nthe same time fattening the pigs.\r\n\r\n=Successional Planting.=--The skillful farmer will arrange\r\nsuccessional plantings of corn, beginning (at Philadelphia) May 10th\r\nand ending about July 10th. The first and last plantings should be of\r\nthe early sorts; the intermediate plantings of the full-sized varieties.\r\n\r\n=Profits.=--Profits depend on location. The size of the crop should\r\napproximate 1,000 dozens of ears per acre, and the gross receipts should\r\nbe $100 to $200 per acre, more or less, above the value of the fodder.\r\n\r\n=Suckering.=--Time is often spent in pulling the suckers from the stalks\r\nof sweet corn. Such time is wasted. If the suckers are let alone they\r\nwill not reduce the number or quality of the marketable ears.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSERADISH.\r\n\r\nFarmers who have soil that is both rich and deep can find profit in\r\ngrowing horseradish on a large scale, in connection with early peas,\r\nbeans or sweet corn. The sets are planted in May, in the rows between\r\ncrops, and after the crops are removed the horseradish makes its main\r\ngrowth. It is perfectly hardy, and comes on rapidly during the late\r\nsummer and autumn months. Where the ground is not strong enough to\r\nproduce large roots the first year, the business will not prove very\r\nremunerative.\r\n\r\n=The Sets.=--Horseradish sets are made by cutting small roots (1/4 to\r\n1/2 inch in thickness) into pieces 6 or 8 inches long. The upper end is\r\ncut square off; the lower end with a slope. This is to get them right\r\nend up at planting time. The small roots are available in quantities in\r\nthe autumn, when the large roots are trimmed for market. The sets are\r\nkept in sand during the winter, or buried in the open ground, in a\r\ncarefully-marked spot, where they can be easily found in the spring.\r\n\r\nIf planted 2 feet apart in rows 3 feet apart, each plant will\r\nrepresent 6 square feet of space, and, hence, about 7,300 sets will be\r\nneeded for an acre.\r\n\r\nThe method of planting is to strike out rows, and with a long dibber\r\nor crowbar make holes 8 or 10 inches deep. A set is dropped into each\r\nhole and the earth pressed about it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ideal Hollow Crown Parsnip.]\r\n\r\nShoots will soon appear above the surface, and when the early crop has\r\nbeen removed from the land, the horseradish should be well cultivated\r\nonce or twice. Little further attention is needed.\r\n\r\nThe roots should be lifted the same year, in December, and stored in\r\nan earth-covered heap or pit, or else in sand in a root cellar. The\r\nsmall lateral roots should be saved for the next year's sets. There is\r\na good demand for horseradish, both wholesale and retail; but prices\r\nshould be ascertained before going into the business in a large way.\r\n\r\nGood roots, after trimming and washing, should weigh half a pound or\r\nmore each.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSNIP.\r\n\r\nThe cultural requirements of the parsnip are quite similar to those of\r\nthe carrot. Any soil that is deep mellow and moderately rich may be\r\nused for parsnips. Fresh manure is to be avoided, as it makes the\r\nroots rough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mammoth Sandwich Island Salsify as Bunched for Market.]\r\n\r\nThe seed should be planted in early spring, while the ground is moist,\r\nas it germinates very slowly. It should be covered to a depth of half\r\nan inch, and the soil pressed down firmly. The plants must be thinned\r\nout to stand 3 or 4 inches apart.\r\n\r\nThe parsnip is a vegetable of a perfectly hardy character. It may remain\r\nin the ground, just where it grows, all winter. The flavor is said to be\r\nimproved by hard freezing, and no amount of freezing will hurt it.\r\n\r\nIt has a high value as human food, and is demanded in large quantities\r\nin some markets. It also has a high value as a stock food, especially\r\nfor cows. It should be fed after milking, in quantities not sufficient\r\nto taint the milk. The price is variable, but about the same as the\r\ncarrot.\r\n\r\n     PARSNIP.--We recommend Ideal Hollow Crown. For description, see\r\n     \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSALSIFY OR OYSTER PLANT.\r\n\r\nSalsify, oyster plant or vegetable oyster is a root of easy culture\r\nand of high food value. In shape it resembles the carrot and parsnip,\r\nand is as perfectly hardy as the latter. The seed should be sown an\r\ninch under the surface, in spring, in rows 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 feet apart,\r\nand the plants thinned to stand 5 inches apart in the rows. The\r\nculture is the same as for parsnips. Fresh manure must be avoided, as\r\nit makes the roots ill-shaped. The roots, under good treatment, will\r\nexceed an inch in diameter, and may attain a size of 2 inches or more.\r\nThey may remain in the ground over winter, to be taken up whenever the\r\nfrost permits or they may be taken up in late autumn and preserved in\r\nsand in a cellar. Good salsify is in demand where its merits are known.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POTATO.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the potato is so well understood by every American\r\nfarmer and gardener that it seems unnecessary to discuss the details\r\nof cutting the tubers, planting, cultivating, harvesting, etc. The\r\nweak points of potato culture are most commonly the fertilizing and\r\nthe treatment of diseases. These will be briefly discussed. As to lack\r\nof moisture, to be remedied by artificial watering, the reader is\r\nreferred to our new book, entitled, \"Irrigation by Cheap Modern\r\nMethods,\" in which a case is mentioned where water alone made a\r\ndifference of 129 bushels per acre in the crop.\r\n\r\n     POTATOES.--Best for the South, Bliss Triumph, Pride of the South,\r\n     Crown Jewel, Early Thoroughbred. General crop in the\r\n     North--Houlton Early Rose, Table King, Late Puritan, Rural\r\n     New-Yorker No. 2. For descriptions of these and other varieties,\r\n     see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n=Fertilizing.=--A ton of potatoes (33-1/3 bushels) contains 4.2 pounds\r\nof nitrogen (equal to 5.1 pounds of ammonia), 1.5 pounds of phosphoric\r\nacid and 10 pounds of potash. This shows that nitrogen and potash are\r\nthe elements mainly abstracted from the soil by a crop of potatoes. An\r\nanalysis is not an infallible index of what must be applied to any\r\nsoil, for that soil may be naturally rich in some one fertilizing\r\nelement and deficient in the others. Only experiment will determine\r\nwhat is best. But a knowledge of the analysis of the crop is necessary\r\nto intelligent experimentation. Nitrogen and potash will evidently be\r\ndemanded in most cases, yet the Ohio Station recently reports that\r\n\"phosphoric acid has been the controlling factor in the increase of\r\nthe potato yields\" in the trials made there. This shows how greatly\r\nsoils vary in their requirements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Harvesting Seed Potatoes near Houlton, Aroostook\r\nCounty, Maine.]\r\n\r\nBarnyard manure would answer all purposes and would be an ideal potato\r\nfertilizer, except for the fact that it so often carries with it the\r\nspores of such diseases as blight, scab and rot. Still, barnyard manure\r\nin a partly rotted condition is very widely used by potato growers.\r\n\r\nClover sod is an excellent source of nitrogen, as heretofore\r\nexplained. The clover is, perhaps, the best of the leguminous crops\r\nfor green manuring purposes. Many successful potato farmers depend\r\nlargely upon clover, supplementing it with a small amount of\r\nhigh-grade complete fertilizer in the rows.\r\n\r\nWhere phosphoric acid is necessary, it can be had in the form of\r\nground bone or acidulated rock, and potash can be had in the form of\r\nsulphate or as kainit. Where the scab is prevalent, it may prove\r\nbetter to use kainit, on account of the salt which it contains, as\r\nwill be presently explained.\r\n\r\n=Planting.=--It requires from seven to ten bushels of tubers to plant\r\nan acre. Some growers use as much as fifteen bushels. The date of\r\nplanting, depth, distance between rows, etc., are details for\r\nindividual determination. Flat culture is better than ridge culture,\r\nso far as conservation of moisture is concerned. It is important that\r\ngood Northern-grown seed be planted; tubers which have not lost their\r\nstrength by excessive sprouting. Storage in a cool, dark, dry place is\r\nbest for potatoes. Whether planted early or late, or at successional\r\ndates, must be determined by the market requirements of the grower.\r\n\r\n=Varieties.=--The varieties of potatoes are many, and while it is wise\r\nto experiment in a small way on new kinds, it is best to depend for\r\nbusiness purposes on standard sorts that have been fully tested.\r\n\r\n=Irrigation.=--After the farmer has exhausted his best efforts in the\r\npreparation and fertilization of the soil, and after good seed has\r\nbeen planted and the best possible culture given, there may come a\r\nseason of prolonged drouth that will defeat his purpose of securing a\r\nlarge crop. This result is not common, but neither is it rare; and\r\nwhere farmers are looking toward the high culture of certain special\r\ncrops, it would be well for them to consider the matter of\r\nartificially watering their potato fields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Average Tuber of Table King, One of the Best All\r\nAround Potatoes.]\r\n\r\n=Diseases and Enemies.=--Not counting dry weather, which sometimes\r\nrobs the farmer of two-thirds of his crop, there are four diseases\r\nwhich exert a disastrous influence on the potato, and which are liable\r\nto occur any season. Two of these diseases are of the leaf and stem\r\nand two of the tubers.\r\n\r\nThe two leaf troubles are respectively known as blight or downy mildew\r\nand the Macrosporium disease. The two tuber troubles are scab and rot.\r\n\r\n=Leaf Blights.=--No attempt will be made here to separately describe\r\nthe two leaf diseases. Both destroy the foliage and check the further\r\ngrowth of both vine and tuber. The leaves turn brown or black, and the\r\nstem quickly wilts and falls. There can be no growth of tuber without\r\nvigorous health of vine. Spraying with Bordeaux mixture, in advance of\r\nthe occurrence of any disease, is recommended.\r\n\r\nBordeaux mixture for this purpose is made by using six pounds of\r\ncopper sulphate and four pounds of quick lime, dissolved in separate\r\nwooden vessels, and the lime water poured into the dissolved blue\r\nstone. This should be diluted with water sufficient to fill a\r\nforty-five gallon barrel. Paris green to the amount of from\r\none-quarter to three-quarters of a pound to the barrel should be\r\nadded, to destroy beetles and other insects.\r\n\r\nThe vines should be sprayed five or six times, beginning when they are\r\n6 inches high, at intervals of ten days or two weeks. During rainy\r\nweather the spraying should be more frequent than during clear\r\nweather. The object is to prolong the life and vigor of the vines. The\r\ncost of the five or six sprayings, including labor at $1.50 per day,\r\nis put at not above $6 per acre, while the crop at stake may be\r\naffected to the extent of scores of bushels.\r\n\r\n=Scab and Rot.=--The evidence about scab and rot is still contradictory,\r\nbut it is likely that these diseases will presently be under control.\r\n\r\nAt the New Jersey Station, Professor Halsted completely conquered scab\r\nwith an application of 300 pounds of flowers of sulphur per acre\r\nscattered in the rows, while the same treatment at the Ohio Station\r\nwas less successful. At the latter station benefit was found in the\r\nuse of salt, kainit, sulphate of potash, etc.\r\n\r\nThe various experiments and observations on potato scab and rot seem\r\nto indicate that scab flourishes best on a soil inclined to be\r\nalkaline, while rot is most prevalent on a soil inclined to be acid.\r\nThe use of lime increases scab, while the use of kainit diminishes it.\r\n\r\nThe best practice, therefore, under present knowledge, would be to use\r\nclean seed on new ground, avoiding fresh stable manure. Clean seed can\r\nbe had by treating tubers with corrosive sublimate. This substance is\r\ndissolved to the amount of 2-1/4 ounces, in two gallons of hot water,\r\nand (after standing a day) diluted with water so as to make fifteen\r\ngallons. In this solution the uncut seed potatoes should be soaked for\r\nan hour and a half. All unplanted seed potatoes should be destroyed,\r\nas the corrosive sublimate is highly poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe use of sulphur, as recommended by Professor Halsted, will prove\r\nentirely satisfactory in some soils. In others, the use of kainit or\r\nsulphate of potash or acid phosphate would no doubt be found preferable.\r\n\r\nWhere soil is badly affected with disease germs, it is unquestionably\r\nbetter to seek a new field than to attempt to disinfect the old one. A\r\nrotation of crops will probably restore diseased land to health more\r\ncheaply and more thoroughly than any other process.\r\n\r\n=Profits.=--Of potato profits it is not necessary to speak, except to\r\nremark that it costs but little more to produce 300 bushels to the\r\nacre than 100 bushels. There can be no doubt whatever that it pays\r\nhandsomely to spray potato vines with the Bordeaux mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUMPKINS AND SQUASHES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mammoth Golden Cashaw Pumpkin, One of the Best for\r\nMarket or Stock Feeding.]\r\n\r\nThere is no clear dividing line between pumpkins and squashes, as they\r\nbelong to the same botanic family--the Cucurbita. Some members of the\r\ngroup are clearly pumpkins, and others just as clearly squashes, but\r\nwhen an attempt is made to draw a sharp line between them, we get into\r\ndifficulty. In general terms the pumpkin has a soft rind or shell and\r\nthe squash a hard rind. But even this thumbnail test is not infallible.\r\n\r\nThese vegetables belong on the farm, on account of the large ground\r\nspace occupied by the vines. Pumpkins may be economically grown in\r\ncorn fields, the seeds being planted along with the corn--one pumpkin\r\nseed to every fourth hill. No special care is needed besides the\r\ncultivation given the corn.\r\n\r\nFarmers should give far more attention to growing squashes, as they\r\nare much superior to pumpkins in food quality, both for the table and\r\nfor stock.\r\n\r\nThere are numbers of excellent squashes now catalogued by the seedsmen\r\nwhich many farmers have never tried, but which are worthy of\r\ncultivation for market purposes. When a farmer by experiment has found\r\na high-quality squash adapted to his soil, he has put himself in\r\npossession of a product of permanent market value.\r\n\r\n     PUMPKIN.--We especially recommend Mammoth Golden Cashaw and\r\n     Winter Luxury. For descriptions, see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden\r\n     and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n     SQUASH.--Early varieties--Mammoth White Bush Scalloped, Giant\r\n     Summer Crookneck. Winter-keeping varieties--Sweet Nut, Faxon,\r\n     Chicago Warted, Hubbard, Early Prolific Orange Marrow. For\r\n     descriptions, see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATOES.\r\n\r\nTomatoes may justly be rated among the leading crops available to farm\r\ngardeners. There is always a brisk market for selected,\r\ncarefully-washed tomatoes, packed in new baskets. Such produce is\r\nseldom offered in excessive quantities.\r\n\r\nAny good corn land will produce good tomatoes. Excessive manuring is\r\nlikely to stimulate the vines at the expense of the fruit. A little\r\ncomplete fertilizer or compost in the hills is desirable.\r\n\r\nTomato seed of early varieties should be started under glass. The seed\r\nis sown on heat and the plants once or twice transplanted, and put in\r\nthe open ground as soon as danger of frost is over. Little is gained\r\nby setting out too early, when the ground is cool. The tomato is of\r\ntropical origin, and makes rapid growth only at a temperature of 65 deg.\r\nor upward. Indeed, it is suspected that one of the worst diseases to\r\nwhich the tomato is liable, the blight, is encouraged, if not wholly\r\ncaused by too early planting in the open ground.\r\n\r\n=Varieties and Planting.=--At 4 feet apart each way, it will require\r\nabout 2,700 tomato plants for an acre of land. In open field culture\r\nthe tomato is always allowed to lie upon the ground. In garden\r\nculture, it is often tied to stakes or supported on trellises. Three\r\nounces of seed will raise sufficient plants for an acre.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of tomatoes, including the early and late\r\nmarket sorts, the yellow kinds, and the little pear-shaped and\r\nplum-shaped tomatoes, both red and yellow, used in pickling. The ideal\r\nmarket tomato is one of medium size and smooth shape. It must have\r\nfirmness and depth, and the quality of ripening evenly all over. There\r\nshould be neither greenness nor wrinkles around the calyx, nor should\r\nthe fruit be of irregular shape. As to color, it is a matter of taste\r\nand neighborhood preference. Some markets demand red and some purple\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n     TOMATO.--We recommend, for earliest, Atlantic Prize and Money\r\n     Maker; for second early and main crop, Brinton's Best, New\r\n     Fortune; for late, Brandywine, Cumberland Red, Stone. For\r\n     descriptions, see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n=Successional Planting.=--If the first tomato plants be set in the\r\nopen ground (at Philadelphia) May 15th to 20th, there should be at\r\nleast one and preferably two later crops, because young, vigorous\r\nplants yield the most and best fruit. It is good practice to sow\r\ntomato seed in the open ground, say about middle of May, and again\r\nsomewhat later. These out-of-door plants will come forward very\r\nrapidly, and will be ready to produce late summer and autumn crops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Atlantic Prize Tomatoes, as they Appear for Sale on\r\nFruit Stands, etc., during the Spring Months.]\r\n\r\n=Cultivation.=--The tomato is of the easiest cultivation, and will\r\ngrow even under neglect, but it so abundantly repays attention, that\r\nno farmer can afford to be careless about the matter. The nights of\r\nMay are cool in the North, and the newly-set plant at first makes\r\nlittle growth. Cultivator and hand-hoe should both be kept in motion\r\nduring this period, and in June also. In the latter month the tomato\r\nwill make a sudden leap toward maturity, and will yield ripe fruit in\r\nJuly. The out-of-doors cropping season lasts for three full months.\r\nThe tomato is now grown under glass almost everywhere, and is to be\r\nhad in the market during all the months of the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Great B. B. (Brinton's Best) Tomato, Best for Main\r\nCrop.]\r\n\r\nThe out-of-doors season is profitably prolonged by picking all the\r\nmature or nearly mature fruit when the first frost comes, in October,\r\nand placing these unripe tomatoes on straw in a cold frame. Covered\r\nwith straw and with the sash to keep out frost, the fruit ripens in a\r\nsatisfactory manner for several weeks. Such a frame must be well\r\nventilated or the tomatoes will rot rather than ripen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New Fortune, one of the Best Second Early Tomatoes.]\r\n\r\n=Diseases and Enemies.=--Tomato diseases, fortunately, are not\r\nnumerous. Blight sometimes sweeps off a whole field of early-set\r\ntomato plants, on farms where later plantings are quite healthy. This\r\nfavors the theory that blight results from weakness caused by early\r\nplanting in cold ground. It is a fungous disease, and may sometimes be\r\nprevented by the use of Bordeaux mixture. The same remedy is the best\r\nknown preventive of black rot.\r\n\r\nPotato bugs may be either hand-picked or poisoned with Paris green.\r\nThe tobacco worm sometimes causes much damage to the tomato. All\r\ndiseased or blighted tomato vines should be promptly burned, and the\r\ncrop carried to new soil the following year.\r\n\r\n=Marketing, Profits, etc.=--As already stated, choice tomatoes in\r\nclean baskets are always in demand, and a new basket will usually pay\r\nfor itself on a single sale. The sum of $150 per acre may be quoted as\r\nthe average gross receipts from tomatoes at present prices. This\r\nestimate is based on the low yield of a half-peck of fruit to each\r\nvine at 25 cents per basket. If sold retail, the tomatoes would\r\ncommand more money, while if sold in bulk to a canning factory the\r\ngross receipts might be larger or smaller, depending on the size of\r\nthe general crop and other circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNIPS AND RUTA BAGAS.\r\n\r\nTurnips and ruta bagas are closely related. The latter are turnips in\r\nfact, and are frequently called Swedes. The common method on many\r\nfarms is to sow turnips broadcast, but it is a far better practice to\r\nsow both these and the ruta bagas in drills, so that they can be kept\r\nclear of weeds and worked by horse-power. Not only are these\r\nadvantages secured, but the row system makes it possible to take out\r\nthe superfluous plants, and secure roots of uniform size and shape.\r\nTurnips and ruta bagas have high economic value as foods, both for\r\nhumanity and for live stock.\r\n\r\n=Turnips.=--Turnips are grown for market purposes both in spring and\r\nin fall. In the spring the seed should be sown early, in mellow soil.\r\nFor the fall crop the seed may be sown either in July or August. The\r\nrows in garden or field may be as close as can be conveniently worked.\r\n\r\n     TURNIP.--For earliest, we recommend Purple Top and White Milan.\r\n     For fall crop, Mammoth Purple Top Globe and Golden Ball. For\r\n     descriptions, see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Budlong or Breadstone Turnip.]\r\n\r\n=Ruta Bagas or Swedes.=--The seed of ruta baga or Swedish turnip\r\nshould be sown (in the latitude of Philadelphia) in July, a little\r\nearlier than the seed of the common turnip. The ground should be well\r\nenriched with rotted manure, the rows 2-1/2 to 3 feet apart, the seed\r\ncovered to the depth of half an inch, and the plants afterward thinned\r\nout so as to stand 6 or 8 inches apart in the row. The crop is almost\r\nalways large and satisfactory.\r\n\r\n     RUTA BAGA.--We recommend Myer's Purple Top Beauty and Budlong.\r\n     For descriptions, see our \"Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Myer's Purple Top Beauty Ruta Baga.]\r\n\r\n=Storage.=--Turnips of all kinds sell well in the winter markets, to\r\nsay nothing of their high value as stock foods. They are easily\r\npreserved in root cellars, covered with sand, or in pits in dry soil,\r\ncovered with straw and earth to prevent freezing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Distribution of Water through Home-made Hose Pipe. An\r\nIllustration from our New Book--\"Irrigation by Cheap Modern Methods.\"\r\nNo Gardener should miss Reading this Work. See page 125.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLES SUITED TO FARM CULTURE IN SOME LOCATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this portion of the book are grouped a number of vegetables not\r\nadapted to every farm or location. The list includes celery, water\r\ncress, cucumbers, egg plants, kale, lettuce, melons, mushrooms,\r\nonions, peas, radishes, rhubarb, spinach, sweet potato, etc. Where\r\nfavored locations for their production exist on farms they may be\r\ngrown with profit, if markets are accessible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELERY.\r\n\r\nOn very many farms there are meadows with deep, rich soils that are\r\nnow lying under grass; or, worse, under tussocks and swamp weeds. Some\r\nlocations are subject to disastrous overflow during freshets, but\r\ninnumerable spots exist where such meadows could with safety be\r\nconverted into celery gardens, capable of easy irrigation, either\r\nsituated above the level of floods or susceptible of artificial\r\nprotection by means of cheap embankments. Such situations are entirely\r\ntoo valuable to use for pasturage. They are the truck gardens of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n=Perfect Celery.=--The object in celery-growing is to produce thick,\r\nrobust, tender, solid, crisp, sweet leaf stalks, free from rust or\r\ninsect attacks. The essentials are rich land and plenty of water, and\r\nskill is required in the two points of bleaching and storing. But\r\nthere are no mysterious processes to be learned. The Kalamazoo growers\r\nhave, it is true, a rare advantage in their deep muck soil, with a\r\npermanent water level only a few inches or feet below the surface, but\r\ntheir success depends on accuracy of working detail almost as much as\r\non perfection of soil. It is not necessary to go to Michigan for good\r\ncelery ground.\r\n\r\n=Fertilizers.=--The best known fertilizer for celery is thoroughly\r\nrotted barnyard manure. Fresh manure is to be avoided for several\r\nreasons. It is less available for plant food, more likely to produce\r\nrust, and more liable to open the soil and render it too dry.\r\nCommercial fertilizers are not infrequently used, but there is a\r\ndecided preference among many celery growers for the rotted stable\r\nproduct. Shallow plowing (5 inches) is practiced, as celery roots do\r\nnot go deep.\r\n\r\n=Planting.=--It requires from 20,000 to 35,000 celery plants to the\r\nacre, according to their distances apart. In the intense culture at\r\nthe great celery centres two crops (and even three crops) of celery\r\nare grown upon the land per year, by a system of planting between\r\nrows, but in the operations of farm gardeners not more than one crop\r\nper season is grown. This may follow an earlier market crop, such as\r\npeas, beans, onions or sweet corn, though where the farmer is hard\r\npushed with other work, the celery may be grown without any other crop\r\npreceding it, but not upon newly-turned sod land, as the earth should\r\nbe loose and mellow.\r\n\r\nSeed for early celery must be started under glass, but the farmer will\r\nfind his best celery market in the autumn. April will, therefore, be\r\nample time for sowing the seed, which should be scattered thinly in\r\nrows in finely-raked mellow soil in the open ground, and covered\r\nlightly. The seed is very slow to germinate, and the bed should be\r\ncopiously watered until the plants are well started. In small\r\noperations, it is well to transplant at least once. In large\r\noperations, the plants are thinned out in the original rows, and\r\ncarried from thence direct to the field. The upper leaves and the tips\r\nof the roots are cut off, and the plants are set firmly in the soil by\r\nmeans of a dibber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. & S. Golder Self-Blanching Celery Prepared for\r\nMarket.]\r\n\r\n=Dates and Distances.=--July is a proper time for setting out celery;\r\npreferably after a rain or during dull weather. The rows may be from 3\r\nto 5 feet apart, depending on the purpose of the planter, and the\r\nplants 5 or 6 inches apart in the rows. If the celery is to be stored\r\nfor blanching, 3-feet rows may be used. If it is to be blanched in the\r\nfield, the distance between the rows should be greater, so that more\r\nloose soil will be available for hilling.\r\n\r\nOne ounce of celery seed will furnish 2,500 to 3,000 plants. A half\r\npound is sufficient to furnish plants for an acre.\r\n\r\nEven on good ground celery should not be set out later than August\r\n15th (in the latitude of Philadelphia), and preferably earlier.\r\n\r\nThe system of level planting is practiced by large growers everywhere.\r\nTrenching is still followed in some private gardens, but is too\r\nexpensive for commercial operations.\r\n\r\n=Varieties.=--The so-called dwarf and half-dwarf varieties have pushed\r\nthe larger kinds out of the market almost entirely, though seed of the\r\ngiant sorts can still be obtained. The dwarf kinds are large enough\r\nfor all purposes, however, and are in best favor everywhere. They are\r\nabout 18 inches high, as compared to twice that height in the\r\nold-fashioned giant types.\r\n\r\nThe favorites of late years for early celery are the self-blanching\r\nsorts, such as White Plume and Golden Self-Blanching, which are the\r\nresult of the continued selection of individual plants or sports\r\nshowing a tendency to blanch easily. For winter keeping, the Perle Le\r\nGrand, Winter Queen and Perfection Heartwell are the best. These\r\nvarieties are beautiful as well as highly palatable. There are also\r\nred or pink sorts, of high table merit and good keeping qualities.\r\n\r\n     CELERY.--We recommend Golden Self-Blanching and White Plume for\r\n     early, Perle Le Grand for both early and late and Winter Queen\r\n     for late. The latter is the very best keeper. See \"Johnson &\r\n     Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n=Cultivation.=--The proper culture of the celery has already been\r\nsuggested in the allusion to its need for water and its shallow\r\nfeeding habits. The surface soil should be highly enriched, the\r\nstirring of the soil very shallow, and the water supply copious,\r\neither by capillary attraction from below (as at Kalamazoo) or by\r\nrainfall or artificial irrigation.\r\n\r\n=Blanching.=--The first step in the process of blanching or bleaching\r\nis what is known as handling. This operation consists in grasping all\r\nthe leaves of a celery plant in one hand, while with the other the\r\nsoil is drawn together and packed so as to hold the stalks in an\r\nupright, compact position. This single operation will fit some of the\r\nearly-planted sorts for market in the course of two weeks; though a\r\nsecond operation, called hilling, is usually considered desirable,\r\neven with the self-blanching sorts. See photograph on first page.\r\n\r\nThe Kalamazoo growers depend on muck for field blanching, though they\r\nalso use boards. Muck is merely a dark soil, containing or consisting\r\nmainly of vegetable matter. They first \"handle,\" as just described,\r\nand about five days later draw 6 inches more of the muck about the\r\ncelery stalks. Again, three days later, they draw an additional 2\r\ninches about the stalks, and in two weeks from the start the celery is\r\nready for market.\r\n\r\nThese operations are frequently done by two men working together, one\r\nholding the stalks and the other drawing the soil to them. The first\r\noperation puts the stalks in an upright, compact position, so that\r\nlittle or no soil can get into the heart of the plant. The second\r\ndraws about the plant all the soil that will conveniently remain\r\nthere. The third merely supplements the second, as the hill has had\r\ntime to become somewhat firm and has settled away a little from the\r\nupper leaves.\r\n\r\nBoards are used for summer blanching, as they are less heating than\r\nsoil. Ordinary lumber, free from knot holes, is employed. The boards\r\nrest on their edges, one board on each side of the row, the tops being\r\ndrawn together until within 2-1/2 inches of each other, and the lower\r\nedge of the board held in place either by stakes or by soil.\r\n\r\nThe work of handling or hilling must be done only when the celery is dry\r\nand unfrozen. In fact, celery must never be handled when wet (except\r\nwhen preparing it for market), or it will surely be rusted and spoiled.\r\n\r\nThe same practices of blanching celery as here mentioned in connection\r\nwith the Kalamazoo operations are in vogue near Philadelphia and other\r\nEastern cities, and are not new. The real reason that Kalamazoo is so\r\ncelebrated is her possession of that wonderful black muck soil,\r\nunderlaid with standing water. This has attracted the best celery\r\ngrowers of the country; men who have small places of from one to three\r\nacres, and who work out every detail to perfection, employing little\r\nlabor outside of their own families and concentrating their efforts on\r\nthe production of perfect celery crops. There are extensive celery\r\ngrowers at Kalamazoo, with tracts of thirty or more acres devoted\r\nexclusively to this vegetable, but the majority of the gardens there\r\nare small, and much hand-work is done.\r\n\r\n=Winter Storage.=--The art of the winter storage of celery, as practiced\r\nby large growers, is not hard to learn. Both at Kalamazoo and here in\r\nthe Eastern States there are two methods in vogue. One is the use of\r\nespecially-built houses, and the other is the open-field plan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Blanching Celery with Boards.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Winter Queen, the Best Late Winter Keeping Celery.]\r\n\r\nThe celery house or \"coop\" is a low frame structure, half under\r\nground, generally 14 or 16 feet wide, and as long as may be desired.\r\nThere is a door in one end and a window in the other. The sides, ends\r\nand roof are double and filled with sawdust. There are wooden chimneys\r\nor ventilators at intervals of 12 feet along the peak of the roof, and\r\nsometimes there are glass windows in the roof, provided with wooden\r\nshutters. The celery stands upon the floor, which is of loose soil.\r\nThere is a narrow walk lengthwise in the middle of the building, and\r\nboards extending from the central walk to the side walls separate the\r\npacked celery into narrow sections. No earth is placed between the\r\ncelery stalks as they stand. They are, in fact, rooted in the soil of\r\nthe floor, and are thus able to make the slight growth demanded for\r\ncomplete blanching. The various doors, windows and ventilators make it\r\npossible to keep the air fresh and wholesome, and during cold weather\r\na stove may afford heat to the storage room. Artificial heat is not\r\ncommonly required.\r\n\r\nAnother method, cheaper and quite as satisfactory, especially on farms\r\nor in market gardens, is to trench the celery in the open field. The\r\nsituation of the trench must be a dry one, where there will be no\r\nstanding water. The trench must be nearly or quite as deep as the\r\nheight of the celery, with perpendicular sides, and a foot or less in\r\nwidth. The stalks are set upright in the trench, with all decayed or\r\nworthless leaves removed, as closely as they will stand, without soil\r\nbetween them. To keep them in that condition is purely a matter of\r\ncare. If they are buried deeply and the weather proves warm they will\r\nrot. But if the covering be decreased in warm weather and increased in\r\ncold weather, the celery can be kept in perfect condition. In private\r\ngardens celery is often planted in double rows, a foot apart, and\r\nwintered where it grows by covering deeply with soil.\r\n\r\nAn excellent plan is to make an A-shaped trough of two boards to turn\r\nthe rain, on top of which a greater or less amount of straw, leaves or\r\nlitter may be piled, if needed.\r\n\r\nMice sometimes do considerable damage to stored celery, but are more\r\neasily controlled in short trenches than in long ones.\r\n\r\nSmall amounts of celery may be stored in cellars, in boxes a foot wide\r\nand a foot deep, with damp sand in the bottom. No soil is needed\r\nbetween the plants. The coolest and darkest part of the cellar is best\r\nfor storage.\r\n\r\n=Diseases.=--Celery diseases are preventable and insect attacks are\r\nfew. For blight, kainit is recommended, both in the seed-bed and open\r\nfield. For rust, the Bordeaux mixture is advised. Hollow-stemmed or\r\npithy celery is the result of poor stock or improper soil, and can be\r\navoided by the use of more manure and more water.\r\n\r\n=New Process.=--The method of growing celery in highly enriched soil,\r\nwith plants set 6 or 8 inches apart both ways, is quite feasible. The\r\nplants stand so close as to blanch each other to some extent, but the\r\nsystem has never attracted general favor. A great deal of water is\r\nrequired. Cultivation is possible only when the plants are small.\r\n\r\n=Profits.=--The use of celery is obviously on the increase, but the\r\ndemand is for a first-class article. The cash results may be set at\r\nanywhere from $200 to $500 per acre. The actual net profits of\r\nwell-conducted operations are considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER CRESS.\r\n\r\nWater cress, a vegetable closely allied to several other edible\r\ncresses, is used in very large quantities in all city restaurants. It\r\nis a much-esteemed winter relish, and is mostly served with every one\r\nof the thousands of beefsteak orders daily filled in the great eating\r\nhouses and lunch rooms. The demand for it seems to be on the increase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water Cress.]\r\n\r\nWater cress is of the easiest culture. It can be grown in the soil of\r\na forcing house under glass, and is extensively produced in this way\r\nby market gardeners.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest method is to grow it in running water, preferably near a\r\nspring head; and many such situations are available to farmers. Flat\r\nbeds, made of loam, gravel, or sand, covered with 3 or 4 inches of\r\nwarm, spring water, will yield great quantities of water cress in\r\nearly spring; and the use of a few sash will keep the cress in growth\r\nduring the winter. The cress should be cut frequently, as the young\r\nshoots are most succulent and tender.\r\n\r\nFor market purposes the water cress is tied in bunches, and retailed at\r\nfrom 3 to 10 cents per bunch, or packed in pint boxes, leaves uppermost,\r\nand retailed for about 10 cents per box. These are winter and early\r\nspring prices. Water cress culture is profitable in favored locations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUCUMBER.\r\n\r\nThe cucumber market is not easily over-supplied, but the pickling tub\r\nshould stand ready to receive all cucumbers not sold in a fresh\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nFor field culture, good ground must be selected, and marked out with a\r\nplow, 4 x 4 feet; or, a little wider, if the soil is strong. At least\r\none shovelful of well-rotted manure is dropped in every hill, and\r\nmixed with the soil, and a dozen seeds planted, to be thinned out\r\nfinally to three or four plants. It is better to have extra plants, on\r\naccount of the attacks of the striped beetle.\r\n\r\nThe cucumber belongs to a botanic family which is naturally tender,\r\nand the seeds should not be sown until the soil is quite warm. For\r\nfarm work, the planting season is the latter part of May and the whole\r\nof June; and even July is a suitable month, if the soil can be\r\nirrigated. It will require two pounds of seed for an acre.\r\n\r\nThe variety sown should depend on the purpose in view; but in all\r\ncommercial operations, well-known and thoroughly tested sorts should\r\nbe chosen. Shallow cultivation is recommended.\r\n\r\nIf an early market is to be supplied with cucumbers, the seeds may be\r\nstarted under glass, on bits of inverted sod or in small boxes, and\r\nset in the open ground on the arrival of settled warm weather; but the\r\nfarmer will usually find it most profitable to sow the seeds where the\r\nplants are to remain.\r\n\r\nThe most serious enemy of the cucumber vine is the striped beetle,\r\nwhich attacks the young plant and frequently ruins it. The remedy is\r\nair-slaked lime, or soot, or sifted coal ashes, or wood ashes diluted\r\nwith dry road dust. The best preventive is salt or kainit, used in the\r\nhills. The true plan is to have strong, vigorous plants, which, as a\r\nrule, will resist and outgrow the striped beetle, and be not greatly\r\ninjured by its attacks. There is a blight which sometimes destroys the\r\ncucumber vine, apparently the result of weakness following a prolonged\r\ndrouth.\r\n\r\nThe vine of the cucumber must be kept in vigorous growth, not only by\r\ncultivation and a sufficient water-supply, but by care in removing all\r\nthe fruit as soon as formed, for, if the seeds be permitted to\r\nmature, the vine will quickly perish. It is the purpose of the vine's\r\nexistence to produce ripe seeds, and it will make repeated and\r\nlong-continued efforts to accomplish this end. In gathering the\r\ncucumbers, it is important to avoid injuring the vine. Some growers\r\nuse a knife; others break the stem by a dexterous twist, without\r\ninjuring the vine in the least.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Johnson & Stokes' Perfected Jersey Pickle Cucumber.]\r\n\r\nIt requires 300 cucumbers (more or less) of fair pickling size to make\r\na bushel, and it is estimated that an acre will produce from 100 to\r\n200 bushels, or even more. When the pickles are pulled while quite\r\nsmall, the number runs up to 125,000 per acre; and the pickle\r\nfactories in some cases make their estimates on a yield of 75,000 per\r\nacre. The price is variable, but often quite profitable.\r\n\r\n     CUCUMBER.--For planting in the South to ship to Northern markets\r\n     use Improved Arlington White Spine. Giant of Pera is a fine table\r\n     sort. For pickling, plant Johnson & Stokes' Perfected Jersey\r\n     Pickle. For description see our \"Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n=Downy Mildew.=--A disease which lately threatened to destroy the\r\nbusiness of growing pickles in New Jersey and elsewhere, the downy\r\nmildew of the cucumber, can be fully overcome by spraying the vines\r\nwith Bordeaux mixture. It requires six or seven applications, at\r\nintervals of a week or ten days, to conquer this comparatively new\r\ndisease. Downy mildew is a fungous trouble affecting the leaves and\r\ndestroying the further usefulness of the vine. A recent New York\r\nexperiment showed a yield of $173 worth of pickles per acre under\r\nspraying as against complete failure where the Bordeaux mixture was\r\nnot used. The cost of spraying was $9.50 per acre, leaving $163.50 per\r\nacre as the value of the crop saved by the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG PLANT.\r\n\r\nThe advisability of growing egg plants in farm gardening operations is\r\na question of location. On a suitable soil, near a good market, the\r\noperation will be a profitable one, if rightly managed. The egg plant\r\nis a tender vegetable, botanically allied to both the tomato and the\r\npotato, but less hardy than either, especially when young. For this\r\nreason it is best to delay sowing the seed, even in hot-beds, until\r\ncold weather is past, for the tender seedlings never fully recover\r\nfrom a chill or set-back. Indeed, for the farm gardener the month of\r\nMay is early enough to sow the seed under glass, for this plant grows\r\nwith great rapidity in a warm soil, and May-sown seed not infrequently\r\nyields plants that outstrip those sown a full month earlier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New Jersey Improved Large Purple Smooth Stem Egg Plant.]\r\n\r\nThe egg plant demands a richer soil than either the potato or tomato.\r\nIt also asks for more water. It is a rank feeder. A good stimulant, if\r\nrotted manure cannot be had, is nitrate of soda at the rate of 400\r\npounds to the acre.\r\n\r\nThe farm gardener will do well to consider his market before engaging\r\nin the production of the egg plant on an extensive scale, for it is a\r\nperishable product. It bears shipment well, but its use is mainly\r\nlimited to consumption while fresh. It may command a very high price\r\nat some seasons of the year and at other times be practically\r\nunsalable at any price, owing to an over-supply.\r\n\r\nIf egg-plant seed be sown under glass in early May, and carefully\r\nprotected against cool weather (especially at night), the young plants\r\nwill be ready to transplant before the end of the month and large\r\nenough for the open field in June. They should be set in rows 4 feet\r\napart, and about 3 feet apart in the row. Set at these distances, an\r\nacre of ground would accommodate about 3,500 plants.\r\n\r\nThe enemy of the egg plant, in growth, is the potato bug, which must\r\nbe hand-picked or poisoned. There is a rot which causes the fruit to\r\ndrop from the stem before reaching maturity. This rot is a fungus, and\r\nthe Bordeaux mixture is recommended for it. The blight which sometimes\r\naffects the foliage is in part at least caused by cold weather, and\r\nfor this there is no remedy, except late planting.\r\n\r\nEvery healthy plant should produce from two to six or more full-sized\r\nfruits, and it is therefore easy to calculate that an acre's product\r\nunder favorable circumstances may be very large.\r\n\r\n     EGG PLANT.--There is nothing equal to the New Jersey Improved\r\n     Large Purple Smooth Stem for the use of farm gardeners. For\r\n     description, see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Johnson & Stokes' Imperial, or Long Standing Kale.]\r\n\r\nKALE OR BORECOLE.\r\n\r\nKale, of which there are many varieties, is a headless cabbage,\r\nclosely allied to such vegetables as Brussels sprouts, collards, etc.\r\nIt is one of the most hardy of vegetables, and in this latitude it\r\nwill live over winter in the open ground, with only straw or litter as\r\na protection. If cut for use when frozen it should be thawed out in\r\ncold water. The kales are among the most delicately flavored cabbages.\r\nSome of them are of such ornamental shape as to be full worthy of\r\ncultivation for decorative purposes. The height varies from 1 to 2\r\nfeet, and the colors include both greens, dark purples and\r\nintermediate shades.\r\n\r\nKale demands a rich, deep soil. The seed should be sown in a border or\r\nseed-bed, and transplanted to the open field and set in rows, after the\r\nmanner of cabbage. It is largely and profitably grown in the South for\r\nshipment to the great Northern markets. Where farmers are situated near\r\ncentres of population where kale is in demand, its culture will be found\r\nprofitable, as it requires even less labor than cabbage. It is planted\r\nboth in spring and autumn. The former crop is for autumn consumption and\r\nthe latter crop is carried over winter after the manner of spinach,\r\nprotected by a light covering of some sort of litter.\r\n\r\n     KALE.--For the South, we recommend Extra Dwarf Green Curled\r\n     Scotch; for the North, Johnson & Stokes' New Imperial. See our\r\n     \"Garden and Farm Manual\" for descriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTUCE.\r\n\r\nIn some sections, especially in the South, lettuce can be grown with\r\nprofit by farm gardeners. Depending on the latitude, the seed may be\r\nplanted from autumn until spring. The plants are usually sheltered and\r\nheaded under glass, or under muslin-covered sash, and are sent North\r\nin ventilated barrels.\r\n\r\nThe lettuce is naturally a cool-weather plant, and its culture is\r\neasy. The seed is cheap and it germinates quickly. Well-grown lettuce\r\nalways commands good prices. It is usual to start the seeds in a\r\nborder or under a frame, and to prick out the plants into more roomy\r\nquarters as soon as they are large enough to handle. In a few weeks\r\nafter transplanting, in good growing weather, they are headed ready\r\nfor market. Good soil, abundance of moisture and free ventilation are\r\nessentials in lettuce production.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the North lettuce culture would be found profitable\r\nby farmers in the summer season, for there are varieties well adapted\r\nto high temperature, provided good soil and sufficient water be\r\nfurnished. There is not a month in the year when lettuce is not\r\ndemanded for use in salads, and this demand is likely to increase.\r\n\r\n     LETTUCE.--For the South, we especially recommend Reichner's Early\r\n     White Butter, Big Boston and New Treasure; for the North, New\r\n     Sensation, Mammoth Salamander and Hornberger's Dutch Butter.\r\n     Please see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMELONS.\r\n\r\nMelon culture belongs on the farm rather than in the small market\r\ngarden, on account of the large space occupied by the growing vines.\r\nAn acre of ground will accommodate only about 450 watermelon hills (at\r\n10 feet each way) or about 1,200 muskmelon or cantaloupe hills (6 feet\r\neach way), and hence the necessity for large areas of ground for the\r\ncultivation of these crops.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the various melons are quite similar. Broken sod\r\nground or any green crop turned down favors their growth, and\r\nwell-rotted stable manure in the hill is the best known stimulant. All\r\nthe melons are tender, and are suited only to warm-weather growth, and\r\nthis fact must be remembered in sowing the seed. Light alluvial soil\r\nnear rivers or streams is adapted to melon growth, and many an old\r\nmeadow now weedy and unprofitable might be used to advantage for one\r\nof these crops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New Black-eyed Susan Watermelon.]\r\n\r\n=The Watermelon.=--For cash-producing purposes the best watermelon is\r\na large one, with a hard rind. It must have a dark pink or red centre\r\nand must be a good shipper. It should weigh thirty to forty pounds,\r\nand there should be 900 to 1,000 first-class melons to the acre.\r\n\r\nThe best melon for family use or for a strictly retail trade is a\r\nmedium-sized variety, which has a thin rind, pink or red flesh and\r\nextra sweetness, weighing from twenty to thirty pounds.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the ground has already been suggested. Two shovels\r\nof manure should go into each hill. The planting date is May in this\r\nlatitude; or as soon as the ground is thoroughly warm. Four pounds of\r\nseed per acre will be required. But one plant per hill is allowed to\r\ngrow. The end of the main shoots should be pinched off, to encourage\r\nbranching and flowering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCultivation should be thorough. Fungous diseases can be controlled by\r\nmeans of the Bordeaux mixture, except that it is difficult to reach\r\nthe under side of the leaves. To prevent sunburn on melons, some\r\ngrowers sow buckwheat when the vines are in blossom, and thus secure a\r\npartial shade by the time the fruit is large enough to be injured by\r\nthe sun. Generally, no protection is necessary.\r\n\r\nAt $10 or $15 per hundred, the average wholesale price at Philadelphia,\r\nwatermelon culture is profitable. Early prices are higher.\r\n\r\n     WATER MELONS.--For shipping--Johnson's Dixie, Blue Gem, Duke\r\n     Jones, Sweet Heart. For home market--Black-Eyed Susan, Florida\r\n     Favorite, Kentucky Wonder, McIver's Wonderful Sugar. For\r\n     descriptions, see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n=Citron.=--This small round melon is cultivated in all respects as the\r\nwatermelon, but being smaller the hills may be closer. It is used in\r\nmaking preserves. The name citron is frequently applied to certain of\r\nthe cantaloupes.\r\n\r\n=Cantaloupes or Muskmelons.=--It is a matter of choice whether the\r\ngreen-fleshed or red-fleshed sorts are grown; or whether the variety\r\nbe large or small. The sorts covered with strongly webbed or netted\r\nmarkings are in high favor for shipping to distant points, as they\r\ncarry well. Flavor is in part at least a matter of temperature and\r\nsunshine. Cantaloupes may be nicely ripened by removing them from the\r\nvines and storing in dry, warm rooms.\r\n\r\nThe usual planting distance is from 4-1/2 to 6 feet, in hills\r\ncontaining rotted manure. Compost, made of hen manure, is sometimes\r\nused in the hill, well mixed with the soil. Good cantaloupes are\r\nalways in active demand.\r\n\r\n     MUSK MELONS.--Early sorts for shipping--McCleary's Improved Jenny\r\n     Lind, Netted Beauty, The Captain, Champion Market, Improved\r\n     Netted Gem, Anne Arundel. Late sorts--The Princess, Johnson &\r\n     Stokes' Superb, etc. See \"Garden and Farm Manual\" for\r\n     descriptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: McCleary's Improved Early Jenny Lind Muskmelon.]\r\n\r\n=Enemies.=--In addition to the fungous diseases of the watermelon and\r\ncantaloupe, which are best treated with Bordeaux mixture, all melons\r\nare sometimes badly troubled with an aphis called the melon louse. The\r\nremedy is whale-oil soap--a pound in six gallons of water; or kerosene\r\nemulsion. The latter is made by dissolving half a pound of soft soap\r\nin one gallon of water; then adding two gallons of kerosene, churning\r\nviolently; then diluting with ten or twelve gallons of water. This\r\nemulsion is put upon the melon vines in the form of a spray, and is\r\none of the best insecticides known. It is to be used on all sucking\r\ninsects, like lice and squash bugs. Biting insects are easily killed\r\nwith Paris green--one pound in 100 pounds of flour or plaster, or in\r\n150 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Improved Early Netted Gem Muskmelon (Rose Gem Strain).]\r\n\r\nWhere the land is suited to melon culture, in any part of the country,\r\nthe farm gardener will find no more satisfactory or remunerative crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nUnder certain favored circumstances the mushroom may be grown as a farm\r\ngardener's crop. The requisites are horse manure and a dark cellar, cave\r\nor vault. If the manure be available and a suitable apartment at hand,\r\nthe growing of mushrooms may be taken up for winter work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Bed of Mushrooms from English Milltrack Spawn.]\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of growing mushrooms, and they can be produced in\r\nany situation where a steady temperature of 60 deg. can be maintained. A\r\nsimple method is to prepare a bed consisting of horse manure and loam,\r\nthree parts by measure of the former and one of the latter, the manure\r\nhaving been somewhat fermented and sweetened by allowing it to heat\r\nand turning it several times. A compact bed a foot deep is made. This\r\nbed will first heat and then cool. As it cools, when at 80 deg. or 85 deg. an\r\ninch below the surface, bits of brick spawn the size of a hen's egg\r\nare inserted about 9 inches apart.\r\n\r\nThe bed must not be immediately covered, or the temperature will rise\r\nsufficiently to kill the spawn. In ten days, more or less, as shown by\r\na thermometer, this danger will be past, and the bed should receive a\r\ncoating of good loam an inch deep. No water is to be applied until\r\nafter the bed is in full bearing.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that the temperature of the room or cellar has been\r\nuniformly 60 deg., day and night; that the bed has not been made where it\r\ncould become water-soaked; that it is sufficiently moist, yet not wet;\r\nand that no draft of air has passed over the surface in a way either\r\nto reduce the temperature of the bed itself or to dry the soil upon\r\nthe surface. If these conditions cannot be maintained, either by a\r\nspecially favorable place or by means of covering the bed with litter,\r\nit is better to let mushrooms alone.\r\n\r\nThe crop should appear in six or eight weeks, and should last two\r\nmonths, the total product being from one-half to one pound per square\r\nfoot. The cash price is from 50 to 75 cents per pound in the large\r\ncities; and the crop is sufficiently profitable to warrant the losses\r\nwhich beginners so commonly experience. These losses are the result of\r\ncarelessness or ignorance in the matter of details.\r\n\r\nThe usual sources of failure are poorly prepared beds, the medium\r\nbeing either too wet or too dry; frequent changes of temperature;\r\nimproper use of water; and, lastly, poor or stale spawn.\r\n\r\nMushrooms are packed in small baskets lined with paper, and carefully\r\ncovered to prevent evaporation. A five-pound package is a favorite\r\nshipping size.\r\n\r\n\r\nONIONS.\r\n\r\nThe onion is a national crop; as widely though not quite as\r\nextensively grown as the potato. It is available as a money crop for\r\nthe farm gardener.\r\n\r\n=Choice of Soil.=--Heavy, stiff clay land is to be avoided. Sand and\r\ngravel dry out too quickly. Stony land renders good culture difficult.\r\nThe best soil for onions is a deep, rich, mellow loam. Soils which\r\nafford natural advantages for irrigation should not be overlooked, as\r\nthe rainfall is often lacking when greatly needed.\r\n\r\n=Fertilizers.=--Onion culture demands high manuring. No amount of\r\nrotted stable manure is likely to be excessive. A ton per acre of\r\nhigh-grade, complete fertilizer is not too much, if moisture can be\r\nsupplied. Hen manure is a good top dressing for onion-beds, furnishing\r\nthe needed nitrogen. Nitrate of soda is a good source of nitrogen, if\r\nnitrogen must be purchased. The clovers and other leguminous crops\r\nyield the cheapest nitrogen. Wood ashes, kainit, etc., furnish potash.\r\nEither ground bone or acid phosphate will give the needed phosphoric\r\nacid. An analysis of the onion shows that it carries away fertility in\r\njust about the proportions furnished by stable manure.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that onions can be grown year after year on the\r\nsame ground, if well manured. Rotation is necessary only in case of the\r\noccurrence of disease or insect attack. The onion loves cool weather.\r\n\r\n=Planting.=--To grow onion sets, the seed is sown in close rows, at\r\nthe rate of from fifty to sixty pounds per acre. To grow large onions\r\ndirect from seed, five pounds of seed per acre will be required. To\r\nplant a field with onion sets will require twelve to fifteen bushels\r\nper acre, according to size of the set.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A List of the most Popular American Onions.]\r\n\r\nAn onion set is merely an immature bulb. Sets vary from the size of a\r\nlarge pea up to that of a walnut. When the seed is sown thickly the\r\nbulbs have no chance to grow, and the summer weather quickly ripens\r\nthe tops, completely suspending the growth of the bulb. In some parts\r\nof the country onion sets cannot be grown with profit, as the tops\r\nrefuse to die and the bulbs or sets do not ripen properly.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all parts of the United States onions can be grown direct\r\nfrom the seed the first year; especially from seed grown around\r\nPhiladelphia, which is earlier than Western-grown. It is quite\r\ncustomary in the South to sow onion seed in late summer or autumn; in\r\nAugust or September. This will give early spring onions of marketable\r\nsize. In the North, within quite recent years, it has become the\r\npractice to sow onion seed in frames, in fall or early spring, and\r\ntransplant the young onions to the open ground. This is sometimes\r\nspoken of as the new onion culture.\r\n\r\nOnion sets or young plants should be placed 3 or 4 inches apart, in\r\nrows a foot apart, if to be cultivated by hand; the rows farther apart\r\nif for horse work.\r\n\r\nThe onion is hardy. Many varieties will live in the open ground over\r\nwinter, if covered (at the North) with light litter. It is in this way\r\nthat shoots for bunching are obtained early in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe seed should be sown for sets when the apple is in bloom. Sets may\r\nbe put into the ground earlier; in fact, as soon as the ground can be\r\nworked. The set should not produce seed the first year, though it\r\noften does so. It should, on the contrary, grow to the size of say 3\r\ninches, and then ripen for winter storage. Excessively large onions\r\nare not desirable. To hasten maturity, the tops may be broken down or\r\nthe roots may be cut by running a knife or sharp plow or cultivator\r\nalong one side of the row.\r\n\r\nThe onion, under favorable circumstances, will produce a crop of 800\r\nbushels (fifty-six pounds to the bushel) per acre; though 500 bushels\r\nis nearer the average product.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Weeding a Field of Onion Sets on our Bucks County Seed\r\nFarm near Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\n=Storage.=--The storage of onions and onion sets is simple. The bulbs\r\nshould first be ripened on the ground, by a brief exposure to wind and\r\nsun. This completes the wilting of the tops. They should then be spread\r\nout on ventilated trays or racks, or a few inches in depth on a floor,\r\nin a dry, shady place, where the air is good, preferably a loft; not a\r\ndamp cellar. Freezing will not injure them, but they must not be handled\r\nwhen they begin to thaw, or they will rot. They must not be bruised\r\nduring the operation of gathering or during the process of storage.\r\n\r\nA popular and excellent method of wintering onions in cold climates is\r\nto spread straw to the depth of 18 inches on a dry floor or scaffold,\r\nand put on a layer of onions from 6 inches to a foot deep, and cover\r\nwith 2 feet of straw. This will not always prevent freezing, but it\r\nchecks all sudden changes.\r\n\r\nOnions not fully cured should never be kept in barrels, but spread out\r\nso as to be perfectly ventilated. Onion sets shrink greatly in\r\nstorage; sometimes as much as one-half between fall and spring.\r\n\r\n=Varieties.=--There are many varieties of onions, some of American and\r\nsome of foreign origin. The former are better keepers, but the latter\r\nare of milder flavor. The American sorts (Danvers, Southport Globe\r\nvarieties, Wethersfield, Extra Early Red, Silver Skin, Strasburg,\r\netc.) are usually considered to be the most profitable; but the\r\nforeign kinds (Prize Taker, Prize Winner, Pearl, Bermuda, Giant Rocca,\r\nVictoria, etc.) are profitable in those parts of the country where\r\nsoil and climate warrant their growth from seed in a single season.\r\n\r\nThe so-called tree onion is a perennial, of American origin, living\r\nout over winter. It is sometimes called Egyptian or top onion. It\r\nproduces bulbs or sets at the top of the seed-stalk.\r\n\r\nThe potato or multiplier onion divides its large bulb into numerous\r\nsmall ones, which in turn produce large onions the next year.\r\n\r\n     ONIONS.--For farm gardeners' purposes, we especially recommend\r\n     Philadelphia Yellow Globe Danvers, Mammoth Yellow Prizetaker,\r\n     White Prize Winner. Earliest Onions are--Extra Early Red Globe\r\n     Danvers, American Extra Early White Pearl, Rhode Island Yellow\r\n     Cracker. The best for sets--Extra Early Red, Philadelphia Yellow\r\n     Dutch and White Silver Skin. For descriptions of varieties, see\r\n     \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n=Diseases and Enemies.=--To prevent maggot, the use of kainit is\r\nrecommended; 600 pounds per acre. For onion smut, which may in part be\r\ncured by the kainit, the best known remedy is a change of soil. Thrip,\r\nwhich causes the cuticle of the leaves to become covered with whitish\r\nor yellowish spots, is best treated by means of kerosene emulsion,\r\nused as a spray. The onion fly may, in part, at least, be abated by\r\nthe use of equal parts of wood ashes and land plaster dusted very\r\nthoroughly on the young plants. Stiff-necked onions, often called\r\nstags, are the result either of improper growth or poor stock. They\r\nare sometimes planted in autumn for use as scallions (scullions) the\r\nfollowing spring.\r\n\r\n=Marketing.=--Onions are sometimes sold in the open field; a good plan\r\nwhen a fair price can be secured. After curing, as already described,\r\nthey are usually sold by the bushel or barrel. They are always in\r\ndemand, as the onion is a standard article of human food.\r\n\r\nIn the green state they are sold either by measure, by the bunch, or\r\nby the rope. The latter method consists in tying the onions along\r\nwisps of straw.\r\n\r\n=Scallions.=--No small amount of money is expended by housekeepers in\r\nthe early spring markets for scallions (scullions), or bunched onion\r\nshoots. These tender shoots are washed, tied and sold for 3 to 5 cents\r\nper bunch, retail, or half those figures wholesale. Scallions are\r\nproduced from either sets or large onions planted the preceding\r\nautumn, and sheltered either by frames or litter, so as to encourage\r\nearly spring growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAS.\r\n\r\nIt will require one and one-half to two bushels of peas to seed an acre,\r\nand no crop finds a more ready sale than fresh peas in the summer and\r\nautumn markets. Farmers who are near centres of population, or who enjoy\r\ngood shipping facilities, will find peas a quick money crop.\r\n\r\nAny good soil will produce a crop of this excellent vegetable, but it\r\nmust not be assumed because the pea is a legume, with\r\nnitrogen-collecting roots, that it will not well repay the application\r\nof manure to the soil. Peas and beans need less assistance than some\r\nother things, but they give good returns for the application of rotted\r\nmanure or artificial fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThe seed should be put into the ground in early spring, as soon as the\r\nsoil is dry enough to receive it, beginning with the smooth,\r\nextra-early sorts, which are more hardy than the wrinkled varieties. A\r\nlittle subsequent frost will do no harm.\r\n\r\nThe smooth, early sorts should be sown in rows, about 3 feet apart,\r\nthe intermediate or half-dwarf sorts in rows 4 feet apart, and the\r\ntall, late varieties, in rows 5 feet apart.\r\n\r\nIn field operations no sticks are used, and large pickings are taken\r\neven from the tall-growing vines while sprawling upon the ground; and\r\nthe labor is vastly less where no sticks are employed.\r\n\r\nThe early peas should stand closer in the rows than the later and\r\nlarger sorts. The Extra Early kinds mature in fifty to fifty-five days\r\nfrom germination; the intermediate kinds in sixty-five to seventy\r\ndays, and the tall and late kinds in seventy-five to eighty days. For\r\nautumn planting, the extra early varieties are used, and are planted\r\nuntil sixty days before frost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plant of New Giant Podded Marrow Pea.]\r\n\r\nMildew is a field enemy of the pea, resulting from unfavorable\r\nweather. The weevil often attacks the seed, but does not injure it for\r\nmarket purposes.\r\n\r\nThe canning of green peas is now an industry of enormous extent in\r\nAmerica. The peas are shelled and sorted by machinery, and thousands\r\nof bushels are annually disposed of in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe wholesale market price of peas in the pod varies from 50 cents to\r\n$3 per bushel at Philadelphia. The latter price is for the early\r\nproduct. The usual retail price is 15 to 25 cents per half peck. The\r\ncrop of green pods per acre may be rated at 100 bushels, more or less.\r\n\r\n     PEAS.--Earliest for the South--Johnson & Stokes' New Record Extra\r\n     Early, Alaska; second early--Johnson & Stokes' Second Early\r\n     Market Garden; late--Giant Podded Marrow, Improved Stratagem,\r\n     Crown Prince, Sugar Marrow. For descriptions, see \"Johnson &\r\n     Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRHUBARB.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the United States rhubarb or pie plant is grown in\r\nvery considerable quantities for market purposes, and with profit. Its\r\nculture is extremely simple. It is merely necessary to plant seed or\r\nroots, and to have the plants about 4 feet apart each way in a\r\npermanent bed. The plant is a perennial, lasting for many years. It is\r\na rank feeder, and the more manure given it, the larger and more\r\nsucculent will be the young shoots. The roots should be divided every\r\nfive years, as they finally become too large. The demand for rhubarb\r\ncontinues through the spring and into summer, and large quantities are\r\ncanned for pie-making. Five leaf stalks make a large bunch. It is\r\nworth $2 to $3 per 100 bunches, wholesale.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADISH.\r\n\r\nFarmers who retail their produce should raise radishes. Rich ground\r\nand abundant moisture are the requisites for quick growth, and upon\r\nquick growth depends good quality. Slow-growing radishes are hot and\r\npithy. The early sorts are best for spring, but the so-called summer\r\nradishes are best for warm weather, as they are not so liable as the\r\nearly kinds to become pithy. Enormous quantities of winter radishes\r\nare grown in autumn, for use and sale during the winter months. They\r\nare kept in sand, like other roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Johnson & Stokes' Olive Scarlet, the Earliest Radish.]\r\n\r\nThe early kinds mature in twenty to twenty-five days from sowing.\r\nNitrate of soda in small quantities is one of the best known\r\nstimulants. Rotted stable manure is good, but hog manure and night\r\nsoil are not in favor among radish growers, tending to produce insect\r\nattacks. The free use of lime, salt or kainit is recommended as a\r\npreventive against insects. Sometimes it is necessary to avoid manure\r\nof any kind, on account of maggots, depending wholly on artificial\r\nfertilizers. As a last resort the radish-bed must be removed to new\r\nground, as the maggot renders radishes wholly unsalable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: China Rose Winter Radish.]\r\n\r\nThe green seed pods of radishes are sometimes used for pickling. The\r\nplant is closely related to the mustard.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to wait for radishes to grow large (except the winter\r\nsorts), as they are sweetest and most succulent when comparatively\r\nsmall.

It is a\r\ncool weather plant, almost perfectly hardy. It may be sown in spring,\r\nfor immediate use, or in the autumn for fall cutting, or for carrying\r\nover winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plants and Roots of Parisian Long Standing Spinach.]\r\n\r\nIt is of the easiest culture, requiring ten or twelve pounds of seed\r\nper acre, either broadcasted or sown in rows. In small gardens it is\r\nusually grown in rows, but in open field culture it is more commonly\r\nbroadcasted. Patches of many acres in extent are seen near the large\r\ncities. It is also grown quite extensively in some parts of the South\r\nfor shipment to Northern markets during January and February.\r\n\r\nTo prepare it for market the leaves are cut before the seed stalk\r\nappears, and after washing are barrelled or crated for shipment.\r\nGrowers receive from $1.50 to $2.50 per barrel in Philadelphia and New\r\nYork in the winter and spring. Where accessible to market, spinach is\r\na profitable crop.\r\n\r\nBlight is the main enemy. The remedy is removal to another soil.\r\n\r\nOf spinach there are many types; some smooth and some with savoy or\r\nwrinkled leaves. The property of standing a long time before going to\r\nseed is desirable, especially when sown in the spring, as it increases\r\nthe length of the cutting season.\r\n\r\nAt the North a slight protection of litter or straw is necessary in\r\nwinter. South of latitude of Washington no protection is needed.\r\nSpinach is cut even when frozen; in fact, at any time when there is no\r\nsnow on the ground. By throwing it into cold water it quickly thaws,\r\nand affords a palatable and healthful food in midwinter. The dead or\r\nyellow leaves should be removed before sending it to market, and if\r\ncarefully prepared it has an attractive green appearance during cold\r\nweather when other vegetables are scarce. The winter crop is larger\r\nthan any other, but much is also grown for spring sales. It is\r\nadmirably adapted to farm culture.\r\n\r\n     SPINACH.--For spring planting, we recommend Parisian Long\r\n     Standing; for autumn, American Savoy or Bloomsdale. See \"Johnson\r\n     & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWEET POTATO.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the sweet potato affords profitable employment to\r\nthousands of American farmers. It is pre-eminently a farmer's crop, on\r\naccount of the ground space occupied. It demands a light or sandy\r\nsoil, well drained and well manured. It has wonderful drouth-resisting\r\nqualities; though, on the other hand, it is quite unable to withstand\r\ncontinued cold, wet weather. Its territorial range may be said to\r\ninclude nearly the whole of the United States, where the soil is\r\nsuited to its growth, and it is even cultivated in Canada. It will in\r\nall probability increase in favor as it is better known and the manner\r\nof preserving or storing it is better understood.\r\n\r\n     SWEET POTATO.--We recommend and endorse the Hardy Bush or\r\n     Vineless Sweet Potato. For description, see \"Johnson & Stokes'\r\n     Garden and Farm Manual.\"\r\n\r\n=Fertilizers.=--There is wide diversity of practice in the matter of\r\nenriching the land for sweet potatoes, and most of the standard\r\nmanures are used, either in one place or another. There seems to be an\r\nalmost universal endorsement of well-rotted stable manure, and next in\r\nfavor is wood ashes. High-grade fertilizer of any kind, thoroughly\r\nincorporated with the soil, may be used.\r\n\r\n=Young Plants.=--Sweet potatoes are propagated by sprouts obtained by\r\nlaying tubers on their sides, not touching each other, covered with\r\nsoil, in specially prepared heated beds. These sprouts produce\r\nabundant rootlets while still attached to the parent tuber, and by\r\npulling them with care, great numbers of young plants can be obtained.\r\nA second and even a third crop of young plants may be pulled from the\r\nsame tubers. In the South no artificial heat is needed.\r\n\r\n=Growing the Slips or Sprouts as Practised in New Jersey.=--The\r\nfire-bed, so-called, is quite generally used in Southern New Jersey\r\nfor obtaining slips or sprouts for spring planting. It is necessary to\r\nhave bottom heat and a uniform temperature of about 70 deg..\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plant of New Hardy Bush or Vineless Sweet Potato.]\r\n\r\nThe fire-bed consists essentially of a pit about 15 by 50 feet in\r\nsize. It is floored with boards laid upon cross pieces. Beneath the\r\nboards there is an air chamber. On top of the boards the bed is made.\r\nAt one end is a furnace, with flues running out into the air space\r\nbeneath the bed, but not reaching the chimney or smoke-pipe at the\r\nopposite end of the bed. At the hottest end of the bed the soil is\r\nover 6 inches deep. At the cool end a depth of 6 inches is quite\r\nsufficient. The whole bed is covered either with canvas muslin or with\r\nglass sashes, there being a ridge pole above the bed, running\r\nlengthwise with it, thus giving a double pitch to muslin or to glass.\r\n\r\nAfter the soil has been heated somewhat, the tubers are laid on the\r\nbed, about an inch apart, and covered with about 3 inches of good\r\nsoil, and the soil, in turn, covered with leaves or hay, to increase\r\nthe warmth of the bed. In a week, more or less, the sprouts will show\r\nabove the surface of the soil, when the leaves or hay must be removed.\r\n\r\nThe object in not connecting the flues from the furnace with the chimney\r\nis to economize heat. The air chamber under the entire bed becomes\r\nevenly heated, and the smoke escapes finally by the chimney. This\r\nchimney may be made of wood, and a height of 8 or 10 feet will afford\r\nample draft. Either wood or coal may be burned, but preferably wood.\r\n\r\nThe planting distance in the field is about 3 feet by 2, the young\r\nplants being set upon ridges. It requires about 9,000 plants to the\r\nacre. The work must not be done until the ground is warm. The crop is\r\nready in from sixty to ninety days.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation.=--Shallow cultivation is all that is required. The vines\r\nat the North are not permitted to take root along their length, but in\r\nthe South they are sometimes allowed to do so, and additional tubers\r\nthus secured. At the North the vines are lifted and turned, to clear\r\nthe way for the cultivator and to prevent rooting.\r\n\r\n=Enemies.=--Black rot is one of the worst of sweet potato diseases.\r\nStem rot is another serious enemy. The best treatment for these and\r\nother fungous troubles is prevention, and the best prevention is a\r\nhealthy soil. It is, therefore, best to go to new land occasionally.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting.=--The common practice is to plow the sweet potatoes out\r\nof the ground just after the first frost has touched the vines. The\r\ntubers must be exposed to the air for a time, and partially dried.\r\nThey are prepared for market, if wanted immediately, by rubbing off\r\nthe soil and sorting into two sizes.\r\n\r\n=Storage.=--At the South one of the several methods of winter storage\r\nis to build a light wooden flue of lattice work, and pack about it a\r\nconical-shaped heap containing about forty or fifty bushels of sweet\r\npotatoes. Straw is used as a covering, with earth upon the straw, the\r\nearth to be increased as the weather becomes colder. Over the entire\r\nheap a rough shed is erected to turn the rain. The top of the flue or\r\nventilator is closed with straw in really cold weather. The spot must\r\nbe a dry one.\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey sweet potato house is a stone building, say 16 x 18\r\nfeet on the inside, with walls 10 feet high, and a good roof. The\r\nbuilding is half under ground, and the earth is banked up around it.\r\nThere is a passage way through the centre, and the bins for the sweet\r\npotatoes are 6 to 8 feet square and 8 to 10 feet deep. There is a door\r\non the south side, with window above, and a stove is placed inside the\r\nbuilding, for use when required. The walls are plastered, and the\r\nunder side of the roof is also covered with lath and plaster, and the\r\nplace is thoroughly weather-proof. A house of this kind will afford\r\nstorage room for 3,000 or more bushels of sweet potatoes, and will\r\nkeep them in excellent condition, if all details receive proper\r\nattention. The requirements for successful storage are that the tubers\r\nshall not be too hot, nor too cold, nor too wet, and that sudden\r\nchanges of temperature shall be avoided. The sweet potato crop may be\r\nsaid to vary from 100 to 150 bushels per acre, under ordinary\r\nmanagement, with higher results under good conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSASHES AND BEDDING PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe cost of a hot-bed sash, glazed and painted, is somewhere about $2;\r\nand such a sash can be made to earn its cost every year. The farmer\r\nwho has, say, a pair of sashes for hot-bed work and another pair for\r\ncold-frame work, can turn them to very good account in the early\r\nspring, not only in starting such bedding plants as may be required in\r\nhis own operations, but in producing plants for his neighbors. It\r\ncosts but little more to grow 1,000 than 100 cabbage, tomato or egg\r\nplants, and the surplus above the home requirement can be converted\r\ninto dollars.\r\n\r\n=The Hot Bed.=--The hot-bed is merely a board-lined pit, containing\r\nfermenting manure, with a few inches of soil on the manure, and\r\ncovered by a sash. The ordinary sash is about 3 x 6 feet. A board\r\nshutter, the exact size of the sash, or a mat of straw, completes the\r\noutfit. The depth of manure, depending on the purpose in view, should\r\nbe from 1 to 2 feet, the depth of soil from 3 to 6 inches, and the\r\ndistance from soil to glass about 4 inches at the start. As the manure\r\nferments the soil will sink.\r\n\r\n=The Cold Frame.=--The cold frame is merely a piece of rich, mellow\r\nsoil, enclosed by boards and covered with glass. There is no bottom\r\nheat of any kind, but it is a great deal warmer than the open soil,\r\nand serves a variety of purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the hot-bed, made in February or March (in the latitude of\r\nPhiladelphia), all tender things may be started. The usual seeds sown\r\nhere at that date on heat are cabbage, cauliflower, radish, lettuce,\r\nonions, etc., followed by tomato, pepper, celery, egg plant, etc.,\r\nincluding flower seeds, if desired.\r\n\r\nThe cold frame is used through the winter for lettuce, onions,\r\ncarrots, corn salad, spinach, etc., and in spring for the reception of\r\nthe things started on heat, when the time arrives for transplanting\r\nand hardening them.\r\n\r\nProperly-managed sashes will do a great deal toward the production of\r\nearly market crops, and profits not infrequently depend upon the item\r\nof earliness.\r\n\r\nThe one thing for inexperienced persons to learn about sashes and\r\ntheir uses is the imperative necessity of free ventilation whenever\r\nthe sun shines on the glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE STRAWBERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the several vegetables enumerated in the preceding\r\npages, there is one of the small fruits that has taken such a\r\nprominent place in what may be termed farm horticulture as to deserve\r\nmention here. It is the strawberry.\r\n\r\nThis berry is, perhaps, the most popular small fruit in America, and\r\nbecause of its perishable character, is one that requires strictly\r\nlocal production. It cannot be shipped long distances without loss of\r\ncharacter and flavor, and hence the local grower will never be crowded\r\nout of his own market.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the strawberry is simple and easy. There are many ways\r\nof setting out plants, and the after-treatment also differs widely.\r\nThere will always be controversy concerning the respective merits of\r\nthe hill system and the matted row system. Each cultivator must decide\r\nfor himself which is the better.\r\n\r\nFor the farmer, whose acres are many and whose duties are pressing,\r\nthere is, perhaps, no better way than to set strawberries in rows 4\r\nfeet apart, with plants 2 feet apart in the row, and to allow the\r\nplants to run together in the rows, giving sufficient attention to\r\nkeep the alleys well stirred and the whole bed clear of weeds. To set\r\nan acre will require about 5,000 plants.\r\n\r\nThe winter covering of litter should be raked into the walks or alleys\r\nas soon as winter is over and allowed to remain there as a mulch for\r\nkeeping the soil cool and damp and for the purpose of keeping the\r\nberries clean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New Twice-Bearing French Strawberry \"Mammoth Perpetual.\"\r\nFor Description, see \"Johnson & Stokes' Garden and Farm Manual.\"]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the crop is off, the bed should be plowed, turning\r\nstrawberries and litter under, and sweet corn or other quick crop at\r\nonce planted. This will insure the gathering of two crops in two\r\nyears; otherwise a strawberry crop means a two-years' use of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe setting out of a new strawberry bed every spring is good practice;\r\nand it is altogether advisable for farmers to occasionally introduce\r\nnew varieties of strawberries on their farms, to replace old or\r\nenfeebled sorts.\r\n\r\nThe profits of strawberry culture are quite large, the gross receipts\r\nnot infrequently running to $250 per acre. New boxes and crates are\r\nadvisable, and are distinctly profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             Page.\r\n\r\n    Asparagus                                   27\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bacteria                                15, 19\r\n\r\n    Barnyard manure                             10\r\n\r\n    Beans                                       33\r\n\r\n    Bedding plants                             119\r\n\r\n    Beets                                       39\r\n\r\n    Bordeaux mixture                            63\r\n\r\n    Borecole                                    91\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cabbage                                     42\r\n\r\n    Cantaloupe                                  97\r\n\r\n    Carrot                                      49\r\n\r\n    Celery                                      75\r\n\r\n    Citron                                      97\r\n\r\n    Cold frame                                 120\r\n\r\n    Crimson clover                              20\r\n\r\n    Corn worm                                   55\r\n\r\n    Corrosive sublimate                         64\r\n\r\n    Cucumber                                    85\r\n\r\n\r\n    Egg plant                                   88\r\n\r\n\r\n    Glass                                      119\r\n\r\n    Green manuring                      19, 21, 22\r\n\r\n\r\n    Horseradish                                 56\r\n\r\n    Hot bed                                    119\r\n\r\n    Humus                                       14\r\n\r\n\r\n    Irrigation                     17, 18, 62, 125\r\n\r\n\r\n    Kale                                        91\r\n\r\n    Kerosene emulsion                           97\r\n\r\n\r\n    Legumes                                     19\r\n\r\n    Lettuce                                     92\r\n\r\n    Lime                                         9\r\n\r\n    Location, choice of                         24\r\n\r\n\r\n    Marketing                                   24\r\n\r\n    Manure, storage                             11\r\n\r\n    Manure, value of                        13, 19\r\n\r\n    Melon louse                                 97\r\n\r\n    Melons                                      94\r\n\r\n    Mushrooms                                   99\r\n\r\n    Muskmelons                                  97\r\n\r\n\r\n    Onions                                     101\r\n\r\n    Oyster plant                                58\r\n\r\n\r\n    Parsnip                                     57\r\n\r\n    Peas                                       108\r\n\r\n    Potato                                      59\r\n\r\n    Potato blight                               63\r\n\r\n    Potato scab                                 63\r\n\r\n    Potato rot                                  63\r\n\r\n    Preservatives of manure                     12\r\n\r\n    Pumpkin                                     65\r\n\r\n\r\n    Radish                                     110\r\n\r\n    Rhubarb                                    110\r\n\r\n    Ruta baga                                   72\r\n\r\n\r\n    Salsify                                     58\r\n\r\n    Salt                                        31\r\n\r\n    Sashes                                     119\r\n\r\n    Soil inoculation                            36\r\n\r\n    Spinach                                    112\r\n\r\n    Squash                                      65\r\n\r\n    Strawberry                                 121\r\n\r\n    Swedes                                      72\r\n\r\n    Sweet potato                               114\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tomatoes                                    66\r\n\r\n    Turnip                                      71\r\n\r\n\r\n    Waste products                              17\r\n\r\n    Water cress                                 84\r\n\r\n    Whale-oil soap                              97\r\n\r\n    Wood ashes                                  17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Everybody Should Read our New Book=\r\n\r\n    =IRRIGATION\r\n    BY CHEAP MODERN METHODS=\r\n\r\n    =Double the Crops--Water will do it.\r\n    Strictly up-to-date.

After reading this work you will be surprised at the\r\ncheapness and practicability of irrigation, which will double the\r\nproduction at an expense of from $10 to $1,000, just according to what\r\nyou want to spend, while it reduces soil culture to an exact science\r\nand enables the tiller of the soil to work on schedule time.\r\n\r\nFor terms on which this book can be had, see our \"Garden and Farm\r\nManual,\" which is sent free to all who write for it.\r\n\r\nCompiled and published by\r\n\r\n    =JOHNSON & STOKES=\r\n    =..SEED GROWERS AND MERCHANTS..=\r\n    =217 and 219 Market Street   Philadelphia, Pa.=\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Largest Seed Warehouse in the East\r\n\r\nNos. 217 and 219 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pa.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFloracroft Seed Gardens and Trial Grounds\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to get the best results from our efforts, and make sure that\r\ncustomers shall receive from us the best seeds that the world\r\nproduces, we have for many years maintained and carried on extensive\r\ntrials at our Floracroft Seed Gardens and Trial Grounds, located about\r\nnine miles from our city warehouses.

By this means\r\nwe are enabled to satisfy ourselves of the true character and value of\r\nany novelty before it can find a place in our catalogue.\r\n\r\nMany acres are also devoted to the production of pedigree stock seed,\r\nfrom which the seeds we offer are grown. We plant the best seeds\r\nobtainable; then go over the crop, plant by plant, carefully\r\n\"rogueing\" and destroying the inferior and selecting and saving only\r\nthe best. This stock seed from selected plants is sent to be grown on\r\nour farms in localities where the conditions of soil and climate are\r\nbest adapted to the perfect development of the particular variety. It\r\nis the product of such stock seed only that we offer for sale.\r\n\r\nHere are also located our Seed Testing Houses, where a sample of every\r\nlot of seed, whether grown by ourselves or grown for us under contract,\r\nis thoroughly tested, in mother earth, for vitality and purity of stock,\r\nand only those of satisfactory quality and germinating power are sold.\r\nIn fact, we leave no stone unturned to gain and hold the confidence of\r\nall customers and secure them from disappointment.\r\n\r\n    =JOHNSON & STOKES=\r\n    =..SEEDSMEN..=\r\n    =217 and 219 Market Street,   Philadelphia, Pa.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n     That grow into dollars for the professional market gardener will\r\n     also grow the choicest vegetables and flowers in the Home Garden.\r\n\r\n    =Our Garden and Farm Manual\r\n    Tells All About Them=\r\n\r\n     _It is Sent Free to Seed Buyers_\r\n\r\n    =Johnson & Stokes\r\n    217 and 219 Market Street\r\n    PHILADELPHIA, PA=.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Obvious punctuation and spelling errors repaired.\r\n\r\n    * Footnote moved to the end of the appropriate paragraph.\r\n\r\n    * Notes moved to the end of the appropriate section.\r\n\r\n    * Text enclosed between equal signs was in bold face in the\r\n      original (=bold=).",
