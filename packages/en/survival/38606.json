The Author believes that he has presented his\r\nreaders with a greater amount of valuable information and practical\r\ndirections on the various points treated than will be found in most\r\nsimilar works. The book is not the result of the Author's own experience\r\nsolely, and he acknowledges the assistance he has received from other\r\nauthorities. Among those whom he has consulted he desires specially to\r\nacknowledge his obligations to Mr. Tegetmeier, whose \"Poultry Book\"\r\n(published by Messrs. Routledge & Sons, London) contains his especial\r\nknowledge of the Diseases of Poultry; and to Mr. L. Wright, whose\r\nexcellent and practical Treatise, entitled \"The Practical Poultry\r\nKeeper\" (published by Messrs. Cassell, Petter & Galpin, London), cannot\r\nbe too highly commended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL MANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\n

late years the breeding of poultry has been almost generally\r\nneglected in Great Britain. Any kind of mongrel fowl would do for a\r\nfarmer's stock, although he fully appreciated the importance of breeding\r\nin respect of his cattle and pigs, and the value of improved seeds. Had\r\nhe thought at all upon the subject, it must have occurred to him that\r\npoultry might be improved by breeding from select specimens as much as\r\nany other kind of live stock. The French produce a very much greater\r\nnumber of fowls and far finer ones for market than we do. In France,\r\nBonington Mowbray observes, \"poultry forms an important part of the live\r\nstock of the farmer, and the poultry-yards supply more animal food to\r\nthe great mass of the community than the butchers' shops\"; while in\r\nEgypt, and some other countries of the East, from time immemorial, vast\r\nnumbers of chickens have been hatched in ovens by artificial heat to\r\nsupply the demand for poultry; but in Great Britain poultry-keeping has\r\nbeen generally neglected, eggs are dear, and all kinds of poultry so\r\ngreat a luxury that the lower classes and a large number of the middle\r\nseldom, if ever, taste it, except perhaps once a year in the form of a\r\nChristmas goose, while hundreds of thousands cannot afford even this. It\r\nis computed that a million of eggs are eaten daily in London and its\r\nsuburbs alone; yet this vast number only gives one egg to every three\r\nmouths. \"It is a national waste,\" says Mr. Edwards, \"importing eggs by\r\nthe hundreds of millions, and poultry by tens of thousands, when we are\r\nfeeding our cattle upon corn, and grudging it to our poultry; although\r\nthe return made from the former, it is generally admitted, is not five\r\nper cent. beyond the value of the corn consumed, whereas an immense\r\npercentage can be realised by feeding poultry.\" A writer in the _Times_,\r\nof February 1, 1853, states that, while it will take five years to\r\nfatten an ox to the weight of sixty stone, which will produce a profit\r\nof L30, the same sum may be realised in five months by feeding an equal\r\nweight of poultry for the table.\r\n\r\nAlthough fowls are so commonly kept, the proportion to the population is\r\nstill very small, and the number of those who rear and manage them\r\nprofitably still smaller, chiefly because most people keep them without\r\nsystem or order, and have not given the slightest attention to the\r\nsubject. Nevertheless, it costs no more trouble and much less expense to\r\nkeep fowls successfully and profitably, for neglected fowls are always\r\nfalling sick, or getting into mischief and causing annoyance, and often\r\nexpense and loss. \"A man,\" says Mr. Edwards, \"who expects a good return\r\nof flesh and eggs from fowls insufficiently fed and cared for, is like a\r\nmiller expecting to get meal from a neglected mill, to which he does not\r\nsupply grain.\"\r\n\r\nThe antiquated idea that fowls on a farm did mischief to the crops has\r\nbeen proved to be false; for if the grain is sown as deeply as it should\r\nbe, they cannot reach it by scratching; and, besides, they greatly\r\nprefer worms and insects. Mr. Mechi says, \"commend me to poultry as the\r\nfarmer's best friend,\" and considers the value of fowls, in destroying\r\nthe vast number of worms, grubs, flies, beetles, insects, larvae, &c.,\r\nwhich they devour, as incalculable; and the same may be said as to their\r\ndestruction of the seeds of weeds. They also consume large quantities of\r\nkitchen and table refuse, which is generally otherwise wasted, and often\r\nallowed to decay and become a source of disease, or at least of\r\nimpurity.\r\n\r\nThe enormous prices paid at the poultry shows of 1852 and 1853 for fancy\r\nfowls gave a new impulse to poultry-keeping; and many persons who\r\nformerly thought the management of poultry beneath their attention, now\r\nsuperintend their yards. Mrs. Ferguson Blair, now the Hon. Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, the authoress of the \"Henwife,\" whose experience may be\r\njudged by the fact that she gained in four years upwards of 460 prizes\r\nin England and Scotland, and personally superintended the management of\r\nforty separate yards, in which above 1,000 chickens were hatched\r\nannually, says:--\r\n\r\n\"I began to breed poultry for amusement only, then for exhibition, and\r\nlastly, was glad to take the trouble to make it pay, and do not like my\r\npoultry-yard less because it is not a loss. It is impossible to imagine\r\nany occupation more suited to a lady, living in the country, than that\r\nof poultry rearing. If she has any superfluous affection to bestow, let\r\nit be on her chicken-kind and it will be returned cent. per cent. Are\r\nyou a lover of nature? come with me and view, with delighted gaze, her\r\nchosen dyes. Are you a utilitarian? rejoice in such an increase of the\r\npeople's food. Are you a philanthropist? be grateful that yours has been\r\nthe privilege to afford a _possible_ pleasure to the poor man, to whom\r\nso many are _impossible_. Such we often find fond of poultry--no mean\r\njudges of it, and frequently successful in exhibition. A poor man's\r\npleasure in victory is, at least, as great as that of his richer\r\nbrother. Let him, then, have the field whereon to fight for it.\r\nEncourage village poultry-shows, not only by your patronage, but also by\r\nyour presence. A taste for such may save many from dissipation and much\r\nevil; no man can win poultry honours and haunt the taproom too.\"\r\n\r\nFor those who desire to encourage a taste for poultry keeping in young\r\npeople, and their humbler neighbours, we would recommend our smaller\r\nwork on the subject as a suitable present.[1]\r\n\r\n\"It becomes,\" says Miss Harriet Martineau, \"an interesting wonder every\r\nyear why the rural cottagers of the United Kingdom do not rear fowls\r\nalmost universally, seeing how little the cost would be and how great\r\nthe demand. We import many millions of eggs annually. Why should we\r\nimport any? Wherever there is a cottage family living on potatoes or\r\nbetter fare, and grass growing anywhere near them, it would be worth\r\nwhile to nail up a little penthouse, and make nests of clean straw, and\r\ngo in for a speculation in eggs and chickens. Seeds, worms, and insects\r\ngo a great way in feeding poultry in such places; and then there are the\r\nsmall and refuse potatoes from the heap, and the outside cabbage leaves,\r\nand the scraps of all sorts. Very small purchases of broken rice (which\r\nis extremely cheap), inferior grain, and mixed meal, would do all else\r\nthat is necessary. There would be probably larger losses from vermin\r\nthan in better guarded places; but these could be well afforded as a\r\nmere deduction from considerable gains. It is understood that the\r\nkeeping of poultry is largely on the increase in the country generally,\r\nand even among cottagers; but the prevailing idea is of competition as\r\nto races and specimens for the poultry-yard, rather than of meeting the\r\ndemand for eggs and fowls for the table.\"\r\n\r\nWith the exception of prizes for Dorkings, which are chiefly bred for\r\nmarket, our poultry-shows have always looked upon fowls as if they were\r\nmerely ornamental birds, and have framed their standards of excellence\r\naccordingly, and not with any regard to the production of profitable\r\npoultry, which is much to be regretted.\r\n\r\nMartin Doyle, the cottage economist of Ireland, in his \"Hints to Small\r\nHolders,\" observes that \"a few cocks and hens, if they be prevented from\r\nscratching in the garden, are a useful and appropriate stock about a\r\ncottage, the warmth of which causes them to lay eggs in winter--no\r\ntrifling advantage to the children when milk is scarce. The French, who\r\nare extremely fond of eggs, and contrive to have them in great\r\nabundance, feed the fowls so well on curds and buckwheat, and keep them\r\nso warm, that they have plenty of eggs even in winter. Now, in our\r\ncountry (Ireland), especially in a gentleman's fowl yard, there is not\r\nan egg to be had in cold weather; but the warmth of the poor man's cabin\r\ninsures him an egg even in the most ungenial season.\"\r\n\r\nSuch fowls obtain fresh air, fresh grass, and fresh ground to scratch\r\nin, and prosper in spite of the most miserable, puny, mongrel stock,\r\ndeteriorating year after year from breeding in and in, without the\r\nintroduction of fresh blood even of the same indifferent description.\r\nMany an honest cottager might keep himself and family from the parish by\r\nthe aid of a small stock of poultry, if some kind poultry-keeper would\r\npresent him with two or three good fowls to begin with, for the cottager\r\nhas seldom capital even for so small a purchase.\r\n\r\nConsiderable profit may be made by the sale of eggs for hatching and\r\nsurplus stock, if the breeds kept are good, and the stock known to be\r\npure and vigorous. The \"Henwife\" says: \"You may reduce your expenses by\r\nselling eggs for setting, at a remunerative price. No one should be\r\nashamed to own what he is not ashamed to do; therefore, boldly announce\r\nyour superfluous eggs for sale, at such a price as you think the public\r\nwill pay for them.\" This is now done extensively by breeders of rank and\r\neminence, especially through the London _Field_ and agricultural papers.\r\nBut, \"beware of sending such eggs to market. Every one would be set, and\r\nyou might find yourself beaten by your own stock, very likely in your\r\nown local show, and at small cost to the exhibitor.\"\r\n\r\nThe great secret of success in keeping fowls profitably is to hatch\r\nchiefly in March and April; encourage the pullets by proper feeding to\r\nlay at the age of six months; and fatten and dispose of them when about\r\nnineteen months old, just before their first adult moult; and never to\r\nallow a cockerel to exceed the age of fourteen weeks before it is\r\nfattened and disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE FOWL-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this work we shall consider the accommodation and requisites for\r\nkeeping fowls successfully on a moderate scale, and the reader must\r\nadapt them to his own premises, circumstances, and requirements.\r\nEverywhere there must be some alterations, omissions, or compromises. We\r\nshall state the essentials for their proper accommodation, and describe\r\nthe mode of constructing houses, sheds, and arranging runs, and the\r\nreader must then form his plan according to his own wishes, resources,\r\nand the capabilities of the place. The climate of Great Britain being so\r\nvery variable in itself, and differing in its temperature so much in\r\ndifferent parts, no one manner or material for building the fowl-house\r\ncan be recommended for all cases.\r\n\r\nPlans for poultry establishments on large scales for the hatching,\r\nrearing, and fattening of fowls, turkeys, ducks, and geese, are given in\r\nour smaller work on Poultry, referred to on page 3.\r\n\r\nThe best aspects for the fowl-house are south and south-east, and\r\nsloping ground is preferable to flat.\r\n\r\n\"It is only of late years,\" says Mr. Baily, \"poultry-houses have been\r\nmuch thought of. In large farmyards, where there are cart-houses,\r\ncalf-pens, pig-styes, cattle-sheds, shelter under the eaves of barns,\r\nand numerous other roosting-places, not omitting the trees in the\r\nimmediate vicinity, they are little required--fowls will generally do\r\nbetter by choosing for themselves; and it is beyond a doubt healthier\r\nfor them to be spread about in this manner, than to be confined to one\r\nplace. But a love of order, on the one hand, and a dread of thieves or\r\nfoxes on the other, will sometimes make it desirable to have a proper\r\npoultry-house.\"\r\n\r\nEach family of fowls should, if possible, have a house and run; and if\r\nthey are kept as breeding stock, and the breeds are to be preserved\r\npure, this is essential. And where many kinds are kept, the various\r\nhouses must be adapted to the peculiarities of the different breeds, in\r\norder to do justice to them all, and to attain success in each.\r\n\r\nThe size of the house and the extent of the yard or run should be\r\nproportioned to the number of fowls kept; but it is better for the house\r\nto be too small than too large, particularly in winter, for the mutual\r\nimparting of animal heat. It is found by experience that when fowls are\r\ncrowded into a small space, their desire for laying continues even in\r\nwinter; and there is no fear of engendering disease by crowding if the\r\nhouse is properly ventilated, and thoroughly cleansed every day. Mr.\r\nBaily kept for years a cock and four hens in a portable wooden house six\r\nfeet square, and six feet high in the centre, the sides being somewhat\r\nshorter, and says such a house would hold six hens as well as four.\r\nVentilating holes were made near the top. It had no floor, being placed\r\nupon the ground, and could be moved at pleasure by means of two poles\r\nplaced through two staples fixed at the end of each side. A few\r\nCochin-Chinas may be kept where there is no other convenience than an\r\nouthouse six feet square to serve for their roosting, laying, and\r\nsitting, with a yard of twice that size attached. Mr. Wright \"once knew\r\na young man who kept fowls most profitably, with only a house of his own\r\nconstruction, not more than three feet square, and a run of the same\r\nwidth, under twelve feet long.\" The French breeders keep their fowls in\r\nas small a space as possible, in order to generate and preserve the\r\nwarmth that will induce them to lay; while the English breeders allow\r\nmore space for exercise, larger houses, and free circulation of air. The\r\nFrench mode, is very likely the best for the winter and the English for\r\nthe summer, but the two opposite methods may be made available by having\r\none or more extra houses and runs into which the fowls can be\r\ndistributed in the summer. A close, warm roosting-place will cause the\r\nproduction of more eggs in winter, when they are scarcest and most\r\nvaluable, while air and exercise are necessary to rear superior fowls\r\nfor the table; and if they can have the run of a farmyard or good fields\r\nin which to pick up grain or insects, their flesh will be far superior\r\nin flavour to that of fowls kept in confinement, or crammed in coops.\r\n\r\nAlmost any outbuilding, shed, or lean-to, may be easily and cheaply\r\nconverted into a good fowl-house by the exercise of a little thought and\r\ningenuity.\r\n\r\nThe best material to build a house with is brick, but the cheapest to be\r\ndurable is board, with the roof also of wood, covered with patent felt.\r\nOne objection to timber houses is their being combustible, and easily\r\nignited, and houses had better be built of a single brick in thickness,\r\nunless cheapness is a great object.\r\n\r\nA lean-to fowl-house may be constructed for a very small sum, with\r\nboards an inch thick, against the west or south side of any wall.\r\nWhenever wood is employed it should be tongued, which is a very cheap\r\nmethod of providing against warping by heat, or admitting wind or rain;\r\nlying flat against the uprights, it saves material and has an external\r\nappearance far superior to any other method of boarding. If the second\r\ncoat of paint is rough cast over with sand, it will greatly improve the\r\nappearance, and the house will not be unsightly even in the ornamental\r\npart of a gentleman's grounds.\r\n\r\nA house may be built very cheaply by driving poles into the ground at\r\nequal distances, and nailing weather-boarding upon their outside. If it\r\nis to be square, one pole should be placed at each corner, and two more\r\nwill be required for the door-posts. The house may be made with five,\r\nsix, or more sides, as many poles being used as there are sides, and the\r\ndoor may occupy one side if the house be small and the side narrow,\r\notherwise two door-posts will be required. If the boards are not tongued\r\ntogether, the chinks between them must be well caulked by driving in\r\nstring or tow with a blunt chisel, for it is not only necessary to keep\r\nout the rain but also to keep out the wind, which has great influence on\r\nthe health and laying of the fowls.\r\n\r\nWhere double boarding is employed for the sides, the house may be made\r\nmuch warmer by filling up the space with straw, or still better with\r\nmarsh reeds, so durable for thatching. This plan, unfortunately, affords\r\na shelter for rats, mice, and insects, and therefore, if adopted, it\r\nwill be highly advantageous to form the inside boarding in panels, so as\r\nto be removable at pleasure for examination and cleansing.\r\n\r\nFor the roof, tiles or slates alone are not sufficient, but, if used,\r\nmust have a boarding or ceiling under them; otherwise all the heat\r\ngenerated by the fowls will escape through the numerous interstices, and\r\nit will be next to impossible to keep the house warm in winter. A\r\ncorrugated roof of galvanised iron may be used instead, but a ceiling\r\nalso will be absolutely necessary for the sake of warmth. A rough\r\nceiling of lath and plaster not only preserves the warmth generated by\r\nthe fowls and keeps out the cold, but has the great advantage of being\r\neasily lime-washed, an operation that should be performed at least four\r\nor five times a year. Boards alone make a very good and cheap roof. They\r\nmay be laid either horizontally, one plank overlapping the other, and\r\nthe whole well tarred two or three times, and once every autumn\r\nafterwards; or they may be laid perpendicularly side by side, fitting\r\nclosely, in which case they should be well tarred, then covered with old\r\nsheeting, waste calico, or thick brown paper tightly stretched over it,\r\nand afterwards brushed over with hot tar, or a mixture of tar boiled\r\nwith a little lime, and applied while hot; this, soaking through the\r\ncalico, cements it to the roof, and makes it waterproof. But board\r\ncovered with patent felt, and tarred once a year, is the best. The roof\r\nought to project considerably beyond the walls, in order to prevent the\r\nrain from dripping down them.\r\n\r\nVentilation is most important, and the house should be high, especially\r\nif there are many fowls, for by having it lofty a current of air can\r\npass through it far above the level of the fowls, and purify the\r\natmosphere without causing a draught near them. They very much dislike a\r\ndraught, and will alter their positions to avoid it, and if unable to\r\ndo so, will seek another roosting-place. Ventilation may be obtained by\r\nleaving out some bricks in the wall or making holes in the boarding; and\r\nwhen there is a shed at the side of the fowl-house, by boring a few\r\nholes near the top of the wall next to the shed; all ventilators should\r\nbe considerably above the perches, in order to avoid a draught near to\r\nthe fowls; and should be entirely closed at night in severe weather. The\r\nbest method of ventilation for a fowl-house of sufficient size and\r\nheight, is by means of an opening in the highest part of the roof,\r\ncovered with a lantern of laths or narrow boards, placed one over the\r\nother in a slanting position, with a small space between them like\r\nVenetian blinds.\r\n\r\nLight is essential, not only for the health of the fowls, but in order\r\nthat the state of the house may be seen, and the floor and perches may\r\nbe well cleansed. It may be admitted either through a common window, a\r\npane or two of thick glass placed in the sides, or glass tiles in the\r\nroof. It also induces them to take shelter there in rough weather.\r\n\r\nWarmth is the most important point of all. Fowls that roost in cold\r\nhouses and exposed places require more food and produce fewer eggs; and\r\npullets which are usually forward in laying will not easily be induced\r\nto do so in severe weather if their house is not kept warm. It is a\r\ngreat advantage when the house backs a fire-place or stable. A gentleman\r\ntold Mr. Baily that he \"had been very successful in raising early\r\nchickens in the north of Scotland, and he attributed much of it to the\r\nfollowing arrangements. He had always from twenty to thirty oxen or\r\nother cattle fattening in a long building; he made his poultry-house to\r\njoin this, and had ventilators and openings made in the partition, so\r\nthat the heat of the cattle-shed passed into the fowl-house. Little good\r\nhas resulted from the use of stoves, or hot-water pipes, for poultry;\r\nbut by skilfully taking advantage of every circumstance like that above\r\nmentioned, and by consulting aspect and position, many valuable helps\r\nare obtained.\"\r\n\r\nA house built of wood in the north of England and Scotland must be\r\nlined, unless artificially warmed. Felt is the best material, as its\r\nstrong smell of tar will keep away most insects. Matting is frequently\r\nused, and will make the house sufficiently warm, but it harbours vermin,\r\nand therefore, if used, should be only slightly fastened to the walls,\r\nso that it can be often taken down and well beaten, and, if necessary,\r\nfumigated.\r\n\r\nVarious materials are recommended for the flooring. Boards are warm, but\r\nthey soon become foul. Beaten earth, with loose dust scattered over it\r\nsome inches deep, is excellent for the feet of the birds, but is a\r\nharbour for the minute vermin which are often so troublesome, and even\r\ndestructive, to domestic fowls. Mowbray recommends a floor of\r\n\"well-rammed chalk or earth, that its surface, being smooth, may present\r\nno impediment to being swept perfectly clean.\" Chalk laid on dry\r\ncoal-ashes to absorb the moisture is excellent. A mixture of cow-dung\r\nand water, about the consistency of paint, put on the surface of the\r\nfloor, no thicker than paint, gives it a hard surface which will bear\r\nsweeping down. It is used by the natives of India, not only for the\r\nfloors, but often for the walls of their houses, and is supposed to be\r\nhealthy in its application, and to keep away vermin. Miss Watts says:\r\n\"Dig out the floor to about a foot deep, and fill in with burnt clay,\r\nlike that used extensively on railways, the strong gravel which is\r\ncalled 'metal' in road-making, or any loose dry material of the kind.\r\nLet this be well rammed down, and then lay over it, with a bricklayer's\r\ntrowel, a flooring of a compost of cinder-ashes, gravel, quick-lime, and\r\nwater. This flooring is without the objections due to those which are\r\ncold and damp, and those which imbibe foul moisture. Stone is too cold\r\nfor a flooring; beaten earth or wood becomes foul when the place is\r\ninhabited by living animals; and a flooring of bricks possesses both\r\nthese bad qualities united.\" Bricks are the worst of all materials; they\r\nretain moisture, whether atmospheric or arising from insufficient\r\ndrainage; and thus the temperature is kept low, and disease too often\r\nfollows, especially rheumatic attacks of the feet and legs. However,\r\ntrodden earth makes a very good flooring, and it or other materials may\r\neasily be kept clean by placing moveable boards beneath the perches to\r\nreceive the fowl-droppings. The floor should slope from every direction\r\ntowards the door, to facilitate its cleansing, and to keep it dry.\r\n\r\nPerches are generally placed too high, probably because it was noticed\r\nthat fowls in their natural state, or when at large, usually roost upon\r\nhigh branches; but it should be observed that, in descending from lofty\r\nbranches, they have a considerable distance to fly, and therefore alight\r\non the ground gently, while in a confined fowl-house the bird flutters\r\ndown almost perpendicularly, coming into contact with the floor\r\nforcibly, by which the keel of the breast-bone is often broken, and\r\nbumble-foot in Dorkings and corns are caused.\r\n\r\nSome writers do not object to lofty perches, provided the fowls have a\r\nboard with cross-pieces of wood fastened on to it reaching from the\r\nground to the perch; but this does not obviate the evil, for they will\r\nonly use it for ascent, and not for descent. The air, too, at the upper\r\npart of any dwelling-room, or house for animals, is much more impure\r\nthan nearer the floor, because the air that has been breathed, and\r\nvapours from the body, are lighter than pure air, and consequently\r\nascend to the top. The perches should therefore not be more than\r\neighteen inches from the ground, unless the breed is very small and\r\nlight. Perches are also generally made too small and round. When they\r\nare too small in proportion to the size of the birds, they are apt to\r\ncause the breast-bone of heavy fowls to grow crooked, which is a great\r\ndefect, and very unsightly in a table-fowl. Those for heavy fowls should\r\nnot be less than three inches in diameter. Capital perches may be formed\r\nof fir or larch poles, about three inches in diameter, split into two,\r\nthe round side being placed uppermost; the birds' claws cling to it\r\neasily, and the bark is not so hard as planed wood. The perches, if made\r\nof timber, should be nearly square, with only the corners rounded off,\r\nas the feet of fowls are not formed for clasping smooth round poles.\r\nThose for chickens should not be thicker than their claws can easily\r\ngrasp, and neither too sharp nor too round.\r\n\r\nWhen more than one row of perches is required they should be ranged\r\nobliquely--that is, one above and behind the other; by which arrangement\r\neach perch forms a step to the next higher one, and an equal convenience\r\nin descending, and the birds do not void their dung over each other.\r\nThey should be placed two feet apart, and supported on bars of wood\r\nfixed to the walls at each end; and in order that they may be taken out\r\nto be cleaned, they should not be nailed to the supporter, but securely\r\nplaced in niches cut in the bar, or by pieces of wood nailed to it like\r\nthe rowlocks of a boat. If the wall space at the sides is required for\r\nlaying-boxes, the perches must be shorter than the house, and the\r\noblique bars which support them must be securely fastened to the back of\r\nthe house, and, if necessary, have an upright placed beneath the upper\r\nend of each.\r\n\r\nSome breeders prefer a moveable frame for roosting, formed of two poles\r\nof the required length, joined at each end by two narrow pieces; the\r\nframe being supported upon four or more legs, according to its length\r\nand the weight of the fowls. If necessary it should be strengthened by\r\nrails--connecting the bottoms of the legs, and by pieces crossing from\r\neach angle of the sides and ends. These frames can conveniently be moved\r\nout of the house when they require cleansing. Or it may be made of one\r\npole supported at each end by two legs spread out widely apart, like two\r\nsides of an equilateral or equal-sided triangle. The perch may be made\r\nmore secure for heavy fowls by a rail at each side fastened to each leg,\r\nabout three inches from the foot.\r\n\r\nMr. Baily says: \"I had some fowls in a large outhouse, where they were\r\nwell provided with perches; as there was plenty of room, I put some\r\nsmall faggots, cut for firing, at one extremity, and I found many of the\r\nfowls deserted their perches to roost on the faggots, which they\r\nevidently preferred.\"\r\n\r\nCochin-Chinas and Brahma Pootras do not require perches, but roost\r\ncomfortably on a floor littered down warmly with straw. It should be\r\ngathered up every morning, and the floor cleaned and kept uncovered till\r\nnight, when the straw, if clean, should be again laid down. It must be\r\noften changed. A bed of sand is also used, and a latticed floor even\r\nwithout straw, and some use latticed benches raised about six inches\r\nfrom the floor. But we should think that latticed roosting-places must\r\nbe uncomfortable to fowls, and the dung which falls through is often\r\nunseen, and, consequently, liable to remain for too long a time, while a\r\nportion will stick to the sides of the lattice-work, and be not only\r\ndifficult to see, but also to remove when seen. The \"Henwife\" finds,\r\nhowever, \"that if there are nests, there the Cochins will roost, in\r\nspite of all attempts to make them do otherwise.\" It is a good plan, in\r\nwarm weather, occasionally to sprinkle water over and about the perches,\r\nand scatter a little powdered sulphur over the wetted parts, which will\r\ngreatly tend to keep the fowls free from insect parasites.\r\n\r\nThe nests for laying in are usually made on the ground, or in a kind of\r\ntrough, a little raised; but some use boxes or wicker-baskets, which are\r\npreferable, as they can be removed separately from time to time, and\r\nthoroughly cleansed from dust and vermin, and can also be kept a little\r\napart from each other. These boxes or troughs should be placed against\r\nthe sides of the house, and a board sloping forwards should be fixed\r\nabove, to prevent the fowls from roosting upon the edges. If required, a\r\nrow of laying-boxes or troughs may be placed on the ground, and another\r\nabout a foot or eighteen inches above the floor. The nest should be made\r\nof wheaten, rye, or oaten straw, but never of hay, which is too hot, and\r\nfavourable besides to the increase of vermin. Heath cut into short\r\npieces forms excellent material for nests, but it cannot always be had.\r\nThe material must be changed whenever it smells foul or musty, for if it\r\nis allowed to become offensive, the hens will often drop their eggs upon\r\nthe ground sooner than go to the nest. When the fowl-house adjoins a\r\npassage, or it can be otherwise so contrived, it is an excellent plan\r\nto have a wooden flap made to open just above the back of the nests, so\r\nthat the eggs can be removed without your going into the roosting-house,\r\ntreading the dung about, and disturbing any birds that may be there, or\r\nabout to enter to lay. Where possible the nests in the roosting-houses\r\nshould be used for laying in only; and a separate house should be set\r\napart for sitting hens. Where there are but a few fowls and only one\r\nhouse, if a hen is allowed to sit, a separate nest must be made as quiet\r\nas possible for her.--_See_ Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nCleanliness must be maintained. The _Canada Farmer_ suggested an\r\nadmirable plan for keeping the roosting-house clean. A broad shelf,\r\nsecurely fastened, but moveable, is fixed at the back of the house,\r\neighteen inches from the ground, and the perch placed four or five\r\ninches above it, a foot from the wall. The nests are placed on the\r\nground beneath the board, which preserves them from the roosting fowl's\r\ndroppings, and keeps them well shaded for the laying or sitting hen, if\r\nthe latter is obliged to incubate in the same house, and the nests do\r\nnot need a top. The shelf can be easily scraped clean every morning, and\r\nshould be lightly sanded afterwards. Thus the floor of the house is\r\nnever soiled by the roosting birds, and the broad board at the same time\r\nprotects them from upward draughts of air. Where the nests and perches\r\nare not so arranged, the idea may be followed by placing a loose board\r\nbelow each perch, upon which the dung will fall, and the board can be\r\ntaken up every morning and the dung removed. With proper tools, a\r\nproperly constructed fowl-house can be kept perfectly clean, and all the\r\ndetails of management well carried out without scarcely soiling your\r\nhands. A birch broom is the best implement with which to clean the house\r\nif the floor is as hard as it ought to be. A handful of ashes or sand,\r\nsprinkled over the places from which dung has been removed, will absorb\r\nany remaining impurity.\r\n\r\nFowls' dung is a very valuable manure, being strong, stimulating, and\r\nnitrogenous, possessing great power in forcing the growth of vegetables,\r\nparticularly those of the cabbage tribe, and is excellent for growing\r\nstrawberries, or indeed almost any plants, if sufficiently diluted; for,\r\nbeing very strong, it should always be mixed with earth. A fowl,\r\naccording to Stevens, will void at least one ounce of dry dung in\r\ntwenty-four hours, which is worth at least seven shillings a cwt.\r\n\r\nThe door should fit closely, a slight space only being left at the\r\nbottom to admit air. It should have a square hole, which is usually\r\nplaced either at the top or bottom, for the poultry to enter to roost. A\r\nhole at the top is generally preferred, as it is inaccessible to vermin.\r\nThe fowls ascend by means of a ladder formed of a slanting board, with\r\nstrips of wood nailed across to assist their feet; a similar ladder\r\nshould be placed inside to enable them to descend, if they are heavy\r\nfowls; but the evil is that, even with this precaution, they are\r\ninclined to fly down, as they do from high perches, without using the\r\nladder, and thus injure their feet. A hole in the middle of the door\r\nwould be preferable to either, and obviate the defects of both. These\r\nholes should be fitted with sliding panels on the inside, so that they\r\ncan be closed in order to keep the fowls out while cleaning the house,\r\nor to keep them in until they have laid their eggs, or it may be safe to\r\nlet them out in the morning in any neighbourhood or place where they\r\nwould else be liable to be stolen. Every day, after the fowls have left\r\ntheir roosts, the doors and windows should be opened, and a thorough\r\ndraught created to purify the house. During the winter months all the\r\nentrance holes should be closed from sunset to sunrise, unless in mild\r\nlocalities. Where there are many houses, they should, if possible,\r\ncommunicate with each other by doors, so that they may be cleaned from\r\nend to end, or inspected without the necessity of passing through the\r\nyards, which is especially unpleasant in wet weather. The doors should\r\nbe capable of being fastened on either side, to avoid the chance of the\r\ndifferent breeds intermingling while your attention is occupied in\r\narranging the nests, collecting eggs, &c. See that your fowls are\r\nsecurely locked in at night, for they are more easily stolen than any\r\nother kind of domestic animals. A good dog in the yard or adjoining\r\nhouse or stable is an excellent protection.\r\n\r\nEvery poultry-house should be lime-washed at least four or five times a\r\nyear, and oftener if convenient. Vermin of any kind can be effectually\r\ndestroyed by fumigating the place with sulphur. In this operation a\r\nlittle care is requisite; it should be commenced early in the morning,\r\nby first closing the lattices, and stopping up every crevice through\r\nwhich air can enter; then place on the ground a pan of lighted charcoal,\r\nand throw on it some brimstone broken into small pieces. Directly this\r\nis done the room should be left, the door kept shut and airtight for\r\nsome hours; care too should be taken that the lattices are first opened,\r\nand time given for the vapour to thoroughly disperse before any one\r\nagain enters, when every creature within the building will be found\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nIt is said that a pair of caged guinea-pigs in the fowl-house will keep\r\naway rats.\r\n\r\nIn a large establishment, and in a moderate one, if the outlay is not an\r\nobject, the pens for the chickens and the passages between the various\r\nhouses may be profitably covered with glass, and grapes grown on the\r\nrafters. Raising chickens under glass has been tried with great\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE FOWL-YARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of poultry in this country partly arises from all\r\ngallinaceous birds requiring warmth and dryness to keep them in perfect\r\nhealth, while the climate of Great Britain is naturally moist and cold.\r\n\r\n\"The warmest and driest soils,\" says Mowbray, \"are the best adapted to\r\nthe breeding and rearing of gallinaceous fowls, more particularly\r\nchickens. A wet soil is the worst, since, however ill affected fowls are\r\nby cold, they endure it better than moisture. Land proper for sheep is\r\ngenerally also adapted to the successful keeping of poultry and\r\nrabbits.\"\r\n\r\nBut poultry may be reared and kept successfully even on bad soils with\r\ngood drainage and attention. The \"Henwife\" says: \"I do not consider any\r\none soil necessary for success in rearing poultry. Some think a chalk\r\nsoil essential for Dorkings, but I have proved the fallacy of this\r\nopinion by bringing up, during three years, many hundreds of these _soi\r\ndisant_ delicate birds on the strong blue clay of the Carse of Gowrie,\r\ndoubtless thoroughly drained, that system being well understood and\r\nuniversally practised by the farmers of the district. A coating of\r\ngravel and sand once a year is all that is requisite to secure the\r\nnecessary dryness in the runs.\" The best soil for a poultry-yard is\r\ngravel, or sand resting on chalk or gravel. When the soil is clayey, or\r\ndamp from any other cause, it should be thoroughly drained, and the\r\nwhole or a good portion of the ground should be raised by the addition\r\nof twelve inches of chalk, or bricklayer's rubbish, over which should be\r\nspread a few inches of sand. Cramp, roup, and some other diseases, more\r\nfrequently arise from stagnant wet in the soil than from any other\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe yard should be sheltered from the north and east winds, and where\r\nthis is effected by the position of a shrubbery or plantation in which\r\nthe fowls may be allowed to run, it will afford the advantage of\r\nprotection, not only from wind and cold, but also shelter from the rain\r\nand the burning sun. It also furnishes harbourage for insects, which\r\nwill find them both food and exercise in picking up. Indeed, for all\r\nthese purposes a few bushes may be advantageously planted in or\r\nadjoining any poultry-yard. When a tree can be enclosed in a run, it\r\nforms an agreeable object for the eye, and affords shelter to the fowls.\r\n\r\nA covered run or shed for shelter in wet or hot weather is a great\r\nadvantage, especially if chickens are reared. It may be constructed with\r\na few rough poles supporting a roof of patent felt, thatch, or rough\r\nboard, plain or painted for preservation, and may be made of any length\r\nand width, from four feet upwards, and of any height from four feet at\r\nthe back and three feet in the front, to eight feet at the back and six\r\nfeet in the front. The shed should, if possible, adjoin the fowl-house.\r\nIt should be wholly or partly enclosed with wire-work, which should be\r\nboarded for a foot from the ground to keep out the wet and snow, and to\r\nkeep in small chickens. The roof should project a foot beyond the\r\nuprights which support it, in order to throw the rain well off, and have\r\na gutter-shoot to carry it away and prevent it from being blown in upon\r\nthe enclosed space. The floor should be a little higher than the level\r\nof the yard, both in order to keep it dry and the easier to keep it\r\nclean; and it should be higher at the back than in the front, which will\r\nkeep it drained if any wet should be blown in or water upset. If\r\npreferred, moveable netting may be used, so that the fowls can be\r\nallowed their liberty in fine weather, and be confined in wet weather.\r\nBut the boarding must be retained to keep out the wet. The ground may be\r\nleft in its natural state for the fowls to scratch in, in which case the\r\nsurface should be dug up from time to time and replaced with fresh earth\r\npressed down moderately hard. If the house is large and has a good\r\nwindow, a shed is not absolutely necessary, especially for a few fowls\r\nonly, but it is a valuable addition, and is also very useful to shelter\r\nthe coops of the mother hens and their young birds in wet, windy, or hot\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nBy daily attention to cleanliness, a few fowls may be kept in such a\r\ncovered shed, without having any open run, by employing a thick layer of\r\ndry pulverised earth as a deodoriser, which is to be turned over with a\r\nrake every day, and replaced with fresh dry pulverised earth once a\r\nweek. The dry earth entirely absorbs all odour. In a run of this kind,\r\nsix square feet should be allowed to each fowl kept, for a smaller\r\nsurface of the dry earth becomes moist and will then no longer deodorise\r\nthe dung. Sifted ashes spread an inch deep over the floor of the whole\r\nshed will be a good substitute if the dry earth cannot be had. They\r\nshould be raked over every other morning, and renewed at least every\r\nfortnight, or oftener if possible. The ground should be dug and turned\r\nover whenever it looks sodden, or gives out any offensive smell; and\r\nthree or four times a year the polluted soil below the layer, that is,\r\nthe earth to the depth of three or four inches, should be removed and\r\nreplaced with fresh earth, gravel, chalk, or ashes.[2] The shed must be\r\nso contrived that the sun can shine upon the fowls during some part of\r\nthe day, or they will not continue in health for any length of time, and\r\nit is almost impossible to rear healthy chickens without its light and\r\nwarmth; and it will be a great improvement if part of the run is open.\r\nAnother shed will be required if chickens are to be reared.\r\n\r\nFowls that are kept in small spaces or under covered runs will require a\r\ndifferent diet to those that are allowed to roam in fields and pick up\r\ninsects, grass, &c., and must be provided with green food, animal food\r\nin place of insects, and be well supplied with mortar rubbish and\r\ngravel.\r\n\r\nThe height of the wall, paling, or fencing that surrounds the yard, and\r\nof the partitions, if the yard is divided into compartments for the\r\npurpose of keeping two or more breeds separate and pure, must be\r\naccording to the nature of the breed. Three feet in height will be\r\nsufficient to retain Cochins and Brahmas; six feet will be required for\r\nmoderate-sized fowls; and eight or nine feet will be necessary to\r\nconfine the Game, Hamburg, and Bantam breeds. Galvanised iron\r\nwire-netting is the best material, as it does not rust, and will not\r\nneed painting for a long time. It is made of various degrees of\r\nstrength, and in different forms, and may be had with meshes varying\r\nfrom three-fourths of an inch to two inches or more; with very small\r\nmeshes at the lower part only, to keep out rats and to keep in chickens;\r\nwith spikes upon the top, or with scolloped wire-work, which gives it a\r\nneat and finished appearance; with doors, and with iron standards\r\nterminating in double spikes to fix in the ground, by which wooden posts\r\nare divided, while it can be easily fixed and removed. The meshes should\r\nnot be more than two inches wide, and if the meshes of the lower part\r\nare not very small, it should be boarded to about two feet six inches\r\nfrom the ground, in order to keep out rats, keep in chickens, and to\r\nprevent the cocks fighting through the wire, which fighting is more\r\ndangerous than in the open, for the birds are very liable to injure\r\nthemselves in the meshes, and, Dorkings especially, to tear their combs\r\nand toes in them. If iron standards are not attached to the netting, it\r\nshould be stretched to stout posts, well fixed in the ground, eight feet\r\napart, and fastened by galvanised iron staples. A rail at the top gives\r\na neater appearance, but induces the fowls to perch upon it, which may\r\ntempt them to fly over.\r\n\r\nWhere it is not convenient to fix a fence sufficiently high, or when a\r\nhen just out with her brood has to be kept in, a fowl may be prevented\r\nfrom flying over fences by stripping off the vanes or side shoots from\r\nthe first-flight feathers of one wing, usually ten in number, which will\r\neffectually prevent the bird from flying, and will not be unsightly, as\r\nthe primary quills are always tucked under the others when not used for\r\nflying. This method answers much better than clipping the quills of each\r\nwing, as the cut points are liable to inflict injuries and cause\r\nirritation in moulting.\r\n\r\nThe openness of the feathers of fowls which do not throw off the water\r\nwell, like those of most birds, enables them to cleanse themselves\r\neasier from insects and dirt, by dusting their feathers, and then\r\nshaking off the dirt and these minute pests with the dust. For this\r\npurpose one or more ample heaps of sifted ashes, or very dry sand or\r\nearth, for them to roll in, must be placed in the sun, and, if possible,\r\nunder shelter, so as to be warm and perfectly dry. Wood ashes are the\r\nbest. This dust-heap is as necessary to fowls as water for washing is to\r\nhuman beings. It cleanses their feathers and skin from vermin and\r\nimpurities, promotes the cuticular or skin excretion, and is materially\r\ninstrumental in preserving their health. If they should be much troubled\r\nwith insects, mix in the heap plenty of wood ashes and a little flour of\r\nsulphur.\r\n\r\nA good supply of old mortar-rubbish, or similar substance, must be kept\r\nunder the shed, or in a dry place, to provide material for the\r\neggshells, or the hens will be liable to lay soft-shelled eggs. Burnt\r\noyster-shells are an excellent substitute for common lime, and should be\r\nprepared for use by being heated red-hot, and when cold broken into\r\nsmall pieces with the fingers, but not powdered. Some give chopped or\r\nground bones, or a lump of chalky marl. Eggshells roughly crushed are\r\nalso good, and are greedily devoured by the hens.\r\n\r\nA good supply of gravel is also essential, the small stones which the\r\nfowls swallow being necessary to enable them to digest their hard food.\r\nFowls swallow all grain whole, their bills not being adapted for\r\ncrushing it like the teeth of the rabbit or the horse, and it is\r\nprepared for digestion by the action of a strong and muscular gizzard,\r\nlined with a tough leathery membrane, which forms a remarkable\r\npeculiarity in the internal structure of fowls and turkeys. \"By the\r\naction,\" says Mr. W. H. L. Martin, \"of the two thick muscular sides of\r\nthis gizzard on each other, the seeds and grains swallowed (and\r\npreviously macerated in the crop, and there softened by a peculiar\r\nsecretion oozing from glandular pores) are ground up, or triturated in\r\norder that their due digestion may take place. It is a remarkable fact\r\nthat these birds are in the habit of swallowing small pebbles, bits of\r\ngravel, and similar substances, which it would seem are essential to\r\ntheir health. The definite use of these substances, which are certainly\r\nground down by the mill-like action of the gizzard, has been a matter\r\nof difference among various physiologists, and many experiments, with a\r\nview to elucidate the subject, have been undertaken. It was sufficiently\r\nproved by Spallanzani that the digestive fluid was incapable of\r\ndissolving grains of barley, &c., in their unbruised state; and this he\r\nascertained by filling small hollow and perforated balls and tubes of\r\nmetal or glass with grain, and causing them to be swallowed by turkeys\r\nand other fowls; when examined, after twenty-four and forty-eight hours,\r\nthe grains were found to be unaffected by the gastric fluid; but when he\r\nfilled similar balls and tubes with bruised grains, and caused them to\r\nbe swallowed, he found, after a lapse of the same number of hours, that\r\nthey were more or less dissolved by the action of the gastric juice. In\r\nother experiments, he found that metallic tubes introduced into the\r\ngizzard of common fowls and turkeys, were bruised, crushed, and\r\ndistorted, and even that sharp-cutting instruments were broken up into\r\nblunt fragments without having produced the slightest injury to the\r\ngizzard. But these experiments go rather to prove the extraordinary\r\nforce and grinding powers of the gizzard, than to throw light upon the\r\npositive use of the pebbles swallowed; which, after all, Spallanzani\r\nthought were swallowed without any definite object, but from mere\r\nstupidity. Blumenbach and Dr. Bostock aver that fowls, however well\r\nsupplied with food, grow lean without them, and to this we can bear our\r\nown testimony. Yet the question, what is their precise effect? remains\r\nto be answered. Boerhave thought it probable that they might act as\r\nabsorbents to superabundant acid; others have regarded them as irritants\r\nor stimulants to digestion; and Borelli supposed that they might really\r\ncontribute some degree of nutriment.\"\r\n\r\nSir Everard Home, in his \"Comparative Anatomy,\" says: \"When the external\r\nform of this organ is first attentively examined, viewing that side\r\nwhich is anterior in the living bird, and on which the two bellies of\r\nthe muscle and middle are more distinct, there being no other part to\r\nobstruct the view, the belly of the muscle on the left side is seen to\r\nbe larger than on the right. This appears, on reflection, to be of great\r\nadvantage in producing the necessary motion; for if the two muscles were\r\nof equal strength, they must keep a greater degree of exertion than is\r\nnecessary; while, in the present case, the principal effect is produced\r\nby that of the left side, and a smaller force is used by that on the\r\nright to bring the parts back again. The two bellies of the muscle, by\r\ntheir alternate action, produce two effects--the one a constant friction\r\non the contents of the cavity; the other, a pressure on them. This last\r\narises from a swelling of the muscle inwards, which readily explains all\r\nthe instances which have been given by Spallanzani and others, of the\r\nforce of the gizzard upon substances introduced into it--a force which\r\nis found by their experiments always to act in an oblique direction. The\r\ninternal cavity, when opened in this distended state, is found to be of\r\nan oval form, the long diameter being in the line of the body; its\r\ncapacity nearly equal to the size of a pullet's egg; and on the sides\r\nthere are ridges in their horny coat (lining membrane) in the long\r\ndirection of the oval. When the horny coat is examined in its internal\r\nstructure, the fibres of which it is formed are not found in a direction\r\nperpendicular to the ligamentous substance behind it; but in the upper\r\nportion of the cavity it is obliquely upwards. From this form of cavity\r\nit is evident that no part of the sides is ever intended to be brought\r\nin contact, and that the food is triturated by being mixed with hard\r\nbodies, and acted on by the powerful muscles which form the gizzard.\"\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Spallanzani show that the muscular action of the\r\ngizzard is equally powerful whether the small stones are present or not;\r\nand that they are not at all necessary to the trituration of the firmest\r\nfood, or the hardest foreign substances; but it is also quite clear that\r\nwhen these small stones are put in motion by the muscles of the gizzard\r\nthey assist in crushing the grain, and at the same time prevent it from\r\nconsolidating into a thick, heavy, compacted mass, which would take a\r\nfar longer time in undergoing the digestive process than when separated\r\nand intermingled with the pebbles.\r\n\r\nThis was the opinion of the great physiologist, John Hunter, who, in his\r\ntreatise \"On the Animal Economy,\" after noticing the grinding powers of\r\nthe gizzard, says, in reference to the pebbles swallowed, \"We are not,\r\nhowever, to conclude that stones are entirely useless; for if we compare\r\nthe strength of the muscles of the jaws of animals which masticate their\r\nfood with those of birds who do not, we shall say that the parts are\r\nwell calculated for the purpose of mastication; yet we are not thence to\r\ninfer that the teeth in such jaws are useless, even although we have\r\nproof that the gums do the business when the teeth are gone. If pebbles\r\nare of use, which we may reasonably conclude they are, birds have an\r\nadvantage over animals having teeth, so far as pebbles are always to be\r\nfound, while the teeth are not renewed. If we constantly find in an\r\norgan substances which can only be subservient to the functions of that\r\norgan, should we deny their use, although the part can do its office\r\nwithout them? The stones assist in grinding down the grain, and, by\r\nseparating its parts, allow the gastric juice to come more readily in\r\ncontact with it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a paddock is used as a run for a large number of poultry, it should\r\nbe enclosed either by a wall or paling, but not by a hedge, as the fowls\r\ncan get through it, and will also lay their eggs under the hedge. The\r\npaddock should be well drained, and it will be a great advantage if it\r\ncontains a pond, or has a stream of water running through or by it.\r\nMowbray advises that the grass run should be sown \"with common trefoil\r\nor wild clover, with a mixture of burnet, spurry, or storgrass,\" which\r\nlast two kinds \"are particularly salubrious to poultry.\" If the grass is\r\nwell rooted before the fowls are allowed to run on it, they may range\r\nthere for several hours daily, according to its extent and their number,\r\nbut it should be renewed in the spring by sowing where it has become\r\nbare or thin. A dry common, or pasture fields, in which they may freely\r\nwander and pick up grubs, insects, ants' eggs, worms, and leaves of\r\nplants, is a great advantage, and they may be accustomed to return from\r\nit at a call. Where there is a cropped field, orchard, or garden, in\r\nwhich fowls may roam at certain seasons, when the crops are safe from\r\ninjury, each brood should be allowed to wander in it separately for a\r\nfew hours daily, or on different days, as may be most convenient. \"A\r\ngarden dung-heap,\" says Mr. Baily, \"overgrown with artichokes, mallows,\r\n&c., is an excellent covert for chickens, especially in hot weather.\r\nThey find shelter and meet with many insects there.\" When horse-dung is\r\nprocured for the garden, or supplied from your stables, some should be\r\nplaced in a small trench, and frequently renewed, in which the fowls\r\nwill amuse themselves, particularly in winter, by scraping for corn and\r\nworms. When fowls have not the advantage of a grass run they should be\r\nindulged with a square or two of fresh turf, as often as it can be\r\nobtained, on which they will feed and amuse themselves. It should be\r\nheavy enough to enable them to tear off the grass, without being obliged\r\nto drag the turf about with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nFOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table, which first appeared in the \"Poultry Diary,\" will\r\nshow at a glance the relative constituents and qualities of the\r\ndifferent kinds of food, and may be consulted with great advantage by\r\nthe poultry-keeper, as it will enable him to proportion mixed food\r\ncorrectly, and to change it according to the production of growth,\r\nflesh, or fat that may be desired, and according to the temperature of\r\nthe season. These proportions, of course, are not absolutely invariable,\r\nfor the relative proportions of the constituents of the grain will vary\r\nwith the soil, manure used, and the growing and ripening characteristics\r\nof the season.\r\n\r\n  ------------------+-------+-------+-------+---------+------+-------\r\n                    |Flesh- |Warmth-| Bone- |  Husk   |Water.|\r\n                    |forming|giving |making |   or    |      |\r\n  There is in every | Food. | Food. | Food. | Fibre.  |      |\r\n   100 lbs. of      +-------+-------+-------+---------+      |\r\n                    |Gluten,|Fat or |Starch,| Mineral |      |\r\n                    |  &c.  | Oil.  |  &c.  |Substance|      |\r\n  ------------------+-------+-------+-------+---------+------+-------\r\n  Oats              |  15   |   6   |  47   |    2    |  20  |  10\r\n  Oatmeal           |  18   |   6   |  63   |    2    |  2   |  9\r\n  Middlings or fine |       |       |       |         |      |\r\n    Sharps          |  18   |   6   |  53   |    5    |  4   |  14\r\n  Wheat             |  12   |   3   |  70   |    2    |  1   |  12\r\n  Barley            |  11   |   2   |  60   |    2    |  14  |  1\r\n  Indian Corn       |  11   |   8   |  65   |    1    |  5   |  10\r\n  Rice              |   7   |a trace|  80   | a trace |  --  |  13\r\n  Beans and Peas    |  25   |   2   |  48   |    2    |  8   |  15\r\n  Milk              |   41/2  |   3   |   5   |     3/4   |  --  |  863/4\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBarley is more generally used than any other grain, and, reckoned by\r\nweight, is cheaper than wheat or oats; but, unless in the form of meal,\r\nshould not be the only grain given, for fowls do not fatten upon it, as,\r\nthough possessing a very fair proportion of flesh-forming substances, it\r\ncontains a lesser amount of fatty matters than other varieties of corn.\r\nIn Surrey barley is the usual grain given, excepting during the time of\r\nincubation, when the sitting hens have oats, as being less heating to\r\nthe system than the former. Barley-meal contains the same component\r\nparts as the whole grain, being ground with the husk, but only inferior\r\nbarley is made into meal.\r\n\r\nWheat of the best description is dearer than barley, both by weight and\r\nmeasure, and possesses but about one-twelfth part more flesh-forming\r\nmaterial, but it is fortunate that the small cheap wheat is the best for\r\npoultry, for Professor Johnston says, \"the small or tail corn which the\r\nfarmer separates before bringing his grain to market is richer in gluten\r\n(flesh-forming food) than the full-grown grain, and is therefore more\r\nnutritious.\" The \"Henwife\" finds \"light wheats or tailings the best\r\ngrain for daily use, and next to that barley.\"\r\n\r\nOats are dearer than barley by weight. The heaviest should be bought, as\r\nthey contain very little more husk than the lightest, and are therefore\r\ncheaper in proportion. Oats and oatmeal contain much more flesh-forming\r\nmaterial than any other kind of grain, and double the amount of fatty\r\nmaterial than wheat, and three times as much as barley. Mowbray says\r\noats are apt to cause scouring, and chickens become tired of them; but\r\nthey are recommended by many for promoting laying, and in Kent, Sussex,\r\nand Surrey for fattening. Fowls frequently refuse the lighter samples of\r\noats, but if soaked in water for a few hours so as to swell the kernel,\r\nthey will not refuse them. The meal contains more flesh-forming material\r\nthan the whole grain.\r\n\r\nThe meal of wheat and barley are much the same as the whole grain, but\r\noatmeal is drier and separated from a large portion of the husk, which\r\nmakes it too dear except for fattening fowls and feeding the youngest\r\nchickens, for which it is the very best food. Fine \"middlings,\" also\r\ntermed \"sharps\" and \"thirds,\" and in London coarse country flour, are\r\nmuch like oatmeal, but cheaper than the best, and may be cheaply and\r\nadvantageously employed instead of oatmeal, or mixed with boiled or\r\nsteamed small potatoes or roots.\r\n\r\nMany writers recommend refuse corn for fowls, and the greater number of\r\npoultry-keepers on a small scale perhaps think such light common grain\r\nthe cheapest food; but this is a great mistake, as, though young fowls\r\nmay be fed on offal and refuse, it is the best economy to give the older\r\nbirds the finest kind of grain, both for fattening and laying, and even\r\nthe young fowls should be fed upon the best if fine birds for breeding\r\nor exhibition are desired. \"Instead of giving ordinary or tail corn to\r\nmy fattening or breeding poultry,\" says Mowbray, \"I have always found it\r\nmost advantageous to allow the heaviest and the best; thus putting the\r\nconfined fowls on a level with those at the barn-door, where they are\r\nsure to get their share of the weightiest and finest corn. This high\r\nfeeding shows itself not only in the size and flesh of the fowls, but in\r\nthe size, weight, and substantial goodness of their eggs, which, in\r\nthese valuable particulars, will prove far superior to the eggs of fowls\r\nfed upon ordinary corn or washy potatoes; two eggs of the former going\r\nfurther in domestic use than three of the latter.\" \"Sweepings\" sometimes\r\ncontain poisonous or hurtful substances, and are always dearer, weight\r\nfor weight, than sound grain.\r\n\r\nSome poultry-keepers recommend that the grain should be boiled, which\r\nmakes it swell greatly, and consequently fills the fowl's crop with a\r\nsmaller quantity, and the bird is satisfied with less than if dry grain\r\nbe given; but others say that the fowls derive more nutriment from the\r\nsame quantity of grain unboiled. Indeed, it seems evident that a portion\r\nof the nutriment must pass into the water, and also evaporate in steam.\r\nThe fowl's gizzard being a powerful grinding mill, evidently designed by\r\nProvidence for the purpose of crushing the grain into meal, it is clear\r\nthat whole grain is the natural diet of fowls, and that softer kinds of\r\nfood are chiefly to be used for the first or morning meal for fowls\r\nconfined in houses (see p. 34), and for those being fattened\r\nartificially in coops, where it is desired to help the fowl's digestive\r\npowers, and to convert the food into flesh as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nIndian corn or maize, either whole or in meal, must not be given in too\r\ngreat a proportion, as it is very fattening from the large quantity of\r\noil it contains; but mixed with barley or barley-meal, it is a most\r\neconomical and useful food. It is useful for a change, but is not a good\r\nfood by itself. It may be given once or twice a week, especially in the\r\nwinter, with advantage. From its size small birds cannot eat it and rob\r\nthe fowls. Whether whole or in meal, the maize should be scalded, that\r\nthe swelling may be done before it is eaten. The yellow-coloured maize\r\nis not so good as that which is reddish or rather reddish-brown.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat is about equal to barley in flesh-forming food, and is very\r\nmuch used on the Continent. Mr. Wright has \"a strong opinion that the\r\nenormous production of eggs and fowls in France is to some extent\r\nconnected with the almost universal use of buckwheat by French\r\npoultry-keepers.\" It is not often to be had cheap in this country, but\r\nis hardy and may be grown anywhere at little cost. Mr. Edwards says, he\r\n\"obtained (without manure) forty bushels to the acre, on very poor sandy\r\nsoil, that would not have produced eighteen bushels of oats. The seed is\r\nangular in form, not unlike hempseed; and is stimulating, from the\r\nquantity of spirit it contains.\"\r\n\r\nPeas, beans, and tares contain an extraordinary quantity of\r\nflesh-forming material, and very little of fat-forming, but are too\r\nstimulating for general use, and would harden the muscular fibres and\r\ngive too great firmness of flesh to fowls that are being fattened, but\r\nwhere tares are at a low price, or peas or beans plentiful, stock fowls\r\nmay be advantageously fed upon any of these, and they may be given\r\noccasionally to fowls that are being fattened. It is better to give them\r\nboiled than in a raw state, especially if they are hard and dry, and the\r\nbeans in particular may be too large for the fowls to swallow\r\ncomfortably. Near Geneva fowls are fed chiefly upon tares. Poultry\r\nreject the wild tares of which pigeons are so fond.\r\n\r\nRice is not a cheap food. When boiled it absorbs a great quantity of\r\nwater and forms a large substance, but, of course, only contains the\r\noriginal quantity of grain which is of inferior value, especially for\r\ngrowing chickens, as it consists almost entirely of starch, and does not\r\ncontain quite half the amount of flesh-forming materials as oats. When\r\nbroken or slightly damaged it may be had much cheaper, and will do as\r\nwell as the finest. Boil it for half an hour in skim-milk or water, and\r\nthen let it stand in the water till cold, when it will have swollen\r\ngreatly, and be so firm that it can be taken out in lumps, and easily\r\nbroken into pieces. In addition to its strengthening and fattening\r\nqualities rice is considered to improve the delicacy of the flesh. Fowls\r\nare especially fond of it at first, but soon grow tired of this food. If\r\nmixed with less cloying food, such as bran, they would probably continue\r\nto relish it.\r\n\r\nHempseed is most strengthening during moulting time, and should then be\r\ngiven freely, especially in cold localities.\r\n\r\nLinseed steeped is occasionally given, chiefly to birds intended for\r\nexhibition, to increase the secretion of oil, and give lustre to their\r\nplumage.\r\n\r\nPotatoes, from the large quantity of starch they contain, are not good\r\nunmixed, as regular food, but mixed with bran or meal are most conducive\r\nto good condition and laying. They contain a great proportion of\r\nnutriment, comparatively to their bulk and price; and may be\r\nadvantageously and profitably given where the number of eggs produced is\r\nof more consequence than their flavour or goodness. A good morning meal\r\nof soft food for a few fowls may be provided daily almost for nothing by\r\nboiling the potato peelings till soft, and mashing them up with enough\r\nbran, slightly scalded, to make a tolerably stiff dry paste. The\r\npeelings will supply as many fowls as there are persons at the dinner\r\ntable. A little salt should always be added, and in winter a slight\r\nsprinkling of pepper is good.\r\n\r\n\"It is indispensable,\" says Mr. Dickson, \"to give the potatoes to fowls\r\nnot only in a boiled state, but hot; not so hot, however, as to burn\r\ntheir mouths, as they are stupid enough to do if permitted. They dislike\r\ncold potatoes, and will not eat them willingly. It is likewise requisite\r\nto break all the potatoes a little, for they will not unfrequently leave\r\na potato when thrown down unbroken, taking it, probably, for a stone,\r\nsince the moment the skin is broken and the white of the interior is\r\nbrought into view, they fall upon it greedily. When pieces of raw\r\npotatoes are accidentally in their way, fowls will sometimes eat them,\r\nthough they are not fond of these, and it is doubtful whether they are\r\nnot injurious.\"\r\n\r\nMangold-wurtzel, swedes, or other turnips, boiled with a very small\r\nquantity of water, until quite soft, and then thickened with the very\r\nbest middlings or meal, is the very best soft food, especially for\r\nDorkings.\r\n\r\nSoft food should always be mixed rather dry and _friable_, and not\r\n_porridgy_, for they do not like sticky food, which clings round their\r\nbeaks and annoys them, besides often causing diarrhoea. There should\r\nnever be enough water in food to cause it to glisten in the light. If\r\nthe soft food is mixed boiling hot at night and put in the oven, or\r\ncovered with a cloth, it will be warm in the morning, in which state it\r\nshould always be given in cold weather.\r\n\r\nFowls have their likes and dislikes as well as human beings, some\r\npreferring one kind of grain to all others, which grain is again\r\ndisliked by other fowls. They also grow tired of the same food, and will\r\nthrive all the better for having as much variety of diet as possible,\r\nsome little change in the food being made every few days. Fowls should\r\nnot be forced or pressed to take food to which they show a dislike. It\r\nis most important to give them chiefly that which they like best, as it\r\nis a rule, with but few exceptions, that what is eaten with most relish\r\nagrees best and is most easily digested; but care must be taken not to\r\ngive too much, for one sort of grain being more pleasing to their palate\r\nthan another, induces them to eat gluttonously more than is necessary or\r\nhealthy. M. Reaumur made many careful experiments upon the feeding of\r\nfowls, and among them found that they were much more easily satisfied\r\nthan might be supposed from the greedy voracity which they exhibit when\r\nthey are fed, and that the sorts of food most easily digested by them\r\nare those of which they eat the greatest quantity.\r\n\r\nNo definite scale can be given for the quantity of food which fowls\r\nrequire, as it must necessarily vary with the different breeds, sizes,\r\nages, condition, and health of the fowls; and with the seasons of the\r\nyear, and the temperature of the season, much more food being necessary\r\nto keep up the proper degree of animal heat in winter than in summer;\r\nand the amount of seeds, insects, vegetables, and other food that they\r\nmay pick up in a run of more or less extent. Over-feeding, whether by\r\nexcess of quantity or excess of stimulating constituents, is the cause\r\nof the most general diseases, the greater proportion of these diseases,\r\nand of most of the deaths from natural causes among fowls. When fowls\r\nare neither laying well nor moulting, they should not be fed very\r\nabundantly; for in such a state over-feeding, especially with rich food,\r\nmay cause them to accumulate too much fat. A fat hen ceases to lay, or\r\nnearly, while an over-fed cock becomes lazy and useless, and may die of\r\napoplexy.\r\n\r\nBut half-fed fowls never pay whether kept for the table or to produce\r\neggs. A fowl cannot get fat or make an egg a day upon little or poor\r\nfood. A hen producing eggs will eat nearly twice as much food as at\r\nanother time. In cold weather give plenty of dry bread soaked in ale.\r\n\r\nPoultry prefer to pick their food off the ground. \"No plan,\" says Mr.\r\nBaily, \"is so extravagant or so injurious as to throw down heaps once or\r\ntwice per day. They should have it scattered as far and wide as\r\npossible, that the birds may be long and healthily employed in finding\r\nit, and may not accomplish in a few minutes that which should occupy\r\nthem for hours. For this reason every sort of feeder or hopper is bad.\r\nIt is the nature of fowls to take a grain at a time, and to pick grass\r\nand dirt with it, which assist digestion. They should feed as pheasants,\r\npartridges, grouse, and other game do in a state of nature; if,\r\ncontrary to this, they are enabled to eat corn by mouthfuls, their crops\r\nare soon overfilled, and they seek relief in excessive draughts of\r\nwater. Nothing is more injurious than this, and the inactivity that\r\nattends the discomfort caused by it lays the foundation of many\r\ndisorders. The advantage of scattering the food is, that all then get\r\ntheir share; while if it is thrown only on a small space the master\r\nbirds get the greater part, while the others wait around. In most\r\npoultry-yards more than half the food is wasted; the same quantity is\r\nthrown down day after day, without reference to time of year, alteration\r\nof numbers, or variation of appetite, and that which is not eaten is\r\ntrodden about, or taken by small birds. Many a poultry-yard is coated\r\nwith corn and meal.\"\r\n\r\nIf two fowls will not run after one piece, they do not want it. If a\r\ntrough is used, the best kind is the simplest, being merely a long, open\r\none, shaped like that used for pigs, but on a smaller scale. It should\r\nbe placed about a foot from one of the sides of the yard, behind some\r\nround rails driven into the ground three inches apart, so that the fowls\r\ncannot get into the troughs, so as to upset them, or tread in or\r\notherwise dirty the food. The rails should be all of the same height,\r\nand a slanting board be fixed over the trough.\r\n\r\nSome persons give but one meal a day, and that generally in the morning;\r\nthis is false economy, for the whole of the nutriment contained in the\r\none meal is absorbed in keeping up the animal heat, and there is no\r\nmaterial for producing eggs. \"The number of meals per day,\" says Mr.\r\nWright, \"best consistent with real economy will vary from two to three,\r\naccording to the size of the run. If it be of moderate extent, so that\r\nthey can in any degree forage for themselves, two are quite sufficient,\r\nat least in summer, and should be given early in the morning and the\r\nlast thing before the birds go to roost. In any case, these will be the\r\nprincipal meals; but when the fowls are kept in confinement they will\r\nrequire, in addition, a scanty feed at mid-day. The first feeding should\r\nconsist of soft food of some kind. The birds have passed a whole night\r\nsince they were last fed; and it is important, especially in cold\r\nweather, that a fresh supply should as soon as possible be got into the\r\nsystem, and not merely into the crop. But if grain be given, it has to\r\nbe ground in the poor bird's gizzard before it can be digested, and on a\r\ncold winter's morning the delay is anything but beneficial. But, for the\r\nvery same reason, at the evening meal grain forms the best food which\r\ncan be supplied; it is digested slowly, and during the long cold nights\r\naffords support and warmth to the fowls.\"\r\n\r\nThey should be fed at regular hours, and will then soon become\r\naccustomed to them, and not loiter about the house or kitchen door all\r\nday long, expecting food, which they will do if fed irregularly or too\r\noften, and neglect to forage about for themselves, and thus cost more\r\nfor food.\r\n\r\nGrass is of the greatest value for all kinds of poultry, and where they\r\nhave no paddock, or grass-plot, fresh vegetables must be given them\r\ndaily, as green food is essential to the health of all poultry, even of\r\nthe very youngest chickens. Cabbage and lettuce leaves, spinach, endive,\r\nturnip-tops, turnips cut into small pieces and scattered like grain, or\r\ncut in two, radish-leaves, or any refuse, but not stale vegetables will\r\ndo; but the best thing is a large sod of fresh-cut turf. They are\r\npartial to all the mild succulent weeds, such as chickweed and\r\n_Chenopodium_, or fat-hen, and eat the leaves of most trees and shrubs,\r\neven those of evergreens; but they reject the leaves of strawberries,\r\ncelery, parsnips, carrots, potatoes, onions, and leeks. The supply of\r\ngreen food may be unlimited, but poultry should never be entirely fed on\r\nraw greens. Cabbage and spinach are still more relaxing when boiled than\r\nraw. They are very fond of the fruit of the mulberry and cherry trees,\r\nand will enjoy any that falls, and prevent it from being wasted.\r\n\r\nInsect food is important to fowls, and essential for chickens and laying\r\nhens. \"There is no sort of insect, perhaps,\" says Mr. Dickson, \"which\r\nfowls will not eat. They are exceedingly fond of flies, beetles,\r\ngrasshoppers, and crickets, but more particularly of every sort of\r\ngrub, caterpillar, and maggot, with the remarkable exception of the\r\ncaterpillar moth of the magpie (_Abraxas Grossularia_), which no bird\r\nwill touch.\" M. Reaumur mentions the circumstance of a quantity of wheat\r\nstored in a corn-loft being much infected with the caterpillars of the\r\nsmall corn-moth, which spins a web and unites several grains together. A\r\nyoung lady devised the plan of taking some chickens to the loft to feed\r\non the caterpillars, of which they were so fond that in a few days they\r\ndevoured them all, without touching a single grain of the corn. Mr.\r\nDickson observes, that \"biscuit-dust from ships' stores, which consists\r\nof biscuit mouldered into meal, mixed with fragments still unbroken,\r\nwould be an excellent food for poultry, if soaked in boiling water and\r\ngiven them hot. It is thus used for feeding pigs near the larger\r\nseaports, where it can sometimes be had in considerable quantity, and at\r\na very reasonable price. It will be no detriment to this material if it\r\nbe full of weevils and their grubs, of which fowls are fonder than of\r\nthe biscuit itself.\"\r\n\r\nThere is not any food of which poultry generally are so fond as of\r\nearthworms; but all fowls are not equally fond of them, and some will\r\nnot touch them. They will not eat dead worms. Too many ought not to be\r\ngiven, or they will become too fat and cease laying. When fowls are\r\nintended for the table worms should not be given, as they are said\r\nalways more or less to deteriorate the flavour of the flesh. A good\r\nsupply may easily be obtained. By stamping hard upon the ground, as\r\nanglers do, worms will rise to the surface; but a better method is to\r\nthrust a strong stake or a three-pronged potato-fork into the ground, to\r\nthe depth of a foot or so, and jerk it backwards and forwards, so as to\r\nshake the soil all around. By going out with a light at night in calm,\r\nmild weather, particularly when there is dew, or after rain, a cautious\r\nobserver will see large numbers of worms lying on the ground,\r\ngravel-walks, grass-plots or pastures; but they are easily frightened\r\ninto their holes, though with caution and dexterity a great number, and\r\nthose chiefly of the largest size, may be captured. Mr. Dickson advises\r\nthat cottagers' children should be employed to imitate the example of\r\nthe rooks, by following the plough or the digger, and collecting the\r\nworms which are disclosed to view; and also to collect cock-chafers,\r\n\"and, what would be more advantageous, they might be set to collect the\r\ngrubs of this destructive insect after the plough, and thus, while\r\nproviding a rich banquet for the poultry, they would be clearing the\r\nfields of a most destructive insect.\"\r\n\r\nFowls are very fond of shell snails. They are still more fattening than\r\nworms, and therefore too many must not be given when laying, but they do\r\nnot injure the flavour of the flesh. Some will eat slugs, but they are\r\nnot generally fond of these, and many fowls will not touch them.\r\n\r\nOne great secret of profitable poultry-keeping is, that hens cannot\r\nthrive and lay without a considerable quantity of animal food, and\r\ntherefore if they cannot obtain a sufficient quantity in the form of\r\ninsects, it must be supplied in meat, which, minced small, should be\r\ngiven daily and also to all fowls in winter, as insects are then not to\r\nbe had. Mr. Baily says: \"Do not give fowls meat, but always have the\r\nbones thrown out to them after dinner; they enjoy picking them, and\r\nperform the operation perfectly. Do not feed on raw meat; it makes fowls\r\nquarrelsome, and gives them a propensity to peck each other, especially\r\nin moulting time if the accustomed meat be withheld.\" They will peck at\r\nthe wound of another fowl to procure blood, and even at their own wounds\r\nwhen within reach. Take care that long pieces of membrane, or thick\r\nskin, tough gristle or sinew, or pieces of bone, are not left sticking\r\nto the meat, or it may choke them, or form a lodgment in the crop.\r\n\"Pieces of suet or fat,\" says Mr. Dickson, \"are liked by fowls better\r\nthan any other sort of animal food; but, if supplied in any quantity,\r\nwill soon render them too fat for continuing to lay. Should there be any\r\nquantity of fat to dispose of, it ought, therefore, to be given at\r\nintervals, and mixed or accompanied with bran, which will serve to fill\r\ntheir crops without producing too much nutriment.\" It is a good plan\r\nwhen there are plenty of bones and scraps of meat to boil them well, and\r\nmix bran or pollard with the liquor before giving them to the fowls, as\r\nit makes the meat easier to mince, and extracts nourishment from the\r\nbones. When minced-meat is required for a large number of fowls, a\r\nmincing or sausage machine will save much time and prepare the meat\r\nbetter than chopping. They are as fond of fish, whether salted or fresh,\r\nas of flesh. Crumbs, fragments of pastry, and all the refuse and slops\r\nof the kitchen may be given them. Greaves, so much advertised for fowls,\r\nare very bad, rapidly throwing them out of condition, causing their\r\nfeathers to fall off, spoiling the flavour of the flesh; they cause\r\npremature decrepitude, and engender many diseases, the most common being\r\ndropsy of an incurable character.\r\n\r\nWhere there is no danger from thieves, foxes, or other vermin, and the\r\nrun is extensive, it is the best plan to leave the small door of the\r\nfowl-house open, and the fowls will go out at daybreak and pick up many\r\nan \"early worm\" and insect. The morning meal may be given when the\r\nhousehold has risen.\r\n\r\nA constant supply of fresh clean water is indispensable. Fountains are\r\npreferable to open vessels, in which the fowls are apt to void their\r\ndung, and the chickens to dabble and catch cold, often causing roup,\r\ncramp, &c. The simplest kind of water vessel is a saucer made of red\r\npottery, containing several circular, concentric troughs, each about an\r\ninch wide, and of the same depth. Chickens cannot get drowned in these\r\nshallow vessels, but unless placed behind rails the water will be\r\ndirtied by the fowls. They are sold at all earthenware shops, and are\r\nused for forcing early mustard in. A capital fountain may be made with\r\nan earthenware jar or flower-pot and a flower-pot saucer. Bore a small\r\nhole in the jar or flower-pot an inch and a half from the edge of the\r\nrim, or detach a piece about three-quarters of an inch deep and one inch\r\nwide, from the rim, and if a flower-pot is used plug the hole in the\r\nbottom airtight with a piece of cork; fill the vessel with water, place\r\nthe saucer bottom upwards on the top, press it closely, and quickly turn\r\nboth upside down, when the water will flow into the saucer, filling up\r\nthe space between it and the vessel up to the same height as the hole\r\nin the side of the jar or flower-pot, therefore the hole in the side of\r\nthe rim of the vessel must not be quite so deep as the height of the\r\nside of the saucer; and above all the plug in the flower-pot must be\r\nairtight. This fountain is cheap, simple, and easily cleaned. Water may\r\nalso be kept in troughs, or earthenware pans, placed in the same way.\r\nThe fountains and pans should be washed and filled with fresh water once\r\nevery day, and oftener in warm weather; and they should occasionally be\r\nscoured with sand to remove the green slime which collects on the\r\nsurface, and produces roup, gapes, and other diseases. In winter the\r\nvessels should always be emptied at night, in order to avoid ice from\r\nforming in them, which is troublesome to remove, and snow must never be\r\nallowed to fall into them, snow-water being most injurious to poultry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nEGGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the natural process of moulting, hens cease laying because all\r\nthe superabundant nutriment is required for the production of the new\r\nfeathers. Fowls moult later each time; the moulting occupies a longer\r\nperiod, and is more severe as it becomes later, and if the weather\r\nshould be cold at its termination they seldom recommence laying for some\r\ntime. But young fowls moult in spring. Therefore, by having pullets and\r\nhens of different ages, and moulting at different times, a healthy\r\nlaying stock may be kept up. Pullets hatched in March, and constantly\r\nfed highly, not only lay eggs abundantly in the autumn, but when killed\r\nin the following February or March, are as fat as any one could or need\r\ndesire them to be, and open more like Michaelmas geese than chickens.\r\nWhen eggs alone are wanted, you can commence by buying in the spring as\r\nmany hens as you require, and your run will accommodate, not more than a\r\nyear or eighteen months old. If in good health and condition, they will\r\nbe already laying, or will begin almost immediately; and, if well housed\r\nand fed, will give a constant supply of eggs until they moult in the\r\nautumn. When these hens have ceased laying, and before they lose their\r\ngood condition by moulting, they should be either killed or sold, unless\r\nthey are Hamburgs, Brahmas, or Cochins, and replaced by pullets hatched\r\nin March or April, which will have moulted early, and, if properly\r\nhoused and fed, will begin to lay by November at the latest, and\r\ncontinue laying until February or March, when they may be sold or\r\nkilled, being then in prime condition, and replaced as before; or, as\r\nthey will not stop laying for any length of time, the best may be kept\r\nuntil the autumn, when, if profit is the chief consideration, they must\r\nbe disposed of.[3] But Brahmas, Cochins, and Hamburgs will lay through\r\nthe winter up to their second, or even third year. If you commence\r\npoultry-keeping in the autumn you should buy pullets hatched in the\r\npreceding spring. The best and cheapest plan of keeping up a good stock\r\nis to keep a full-feathered Cochin or two for March or April sitting;\r\nand, if necessary, procure eggs of the breed you desire. The Cochin\r\nwill sit again, being only too often ready for the task; and the\r\nlater-hatched chickens can be fattened profitably for the table. But if\r\nyou wish to obtain eggs all the year round, and to avoid replacing of\r\nstock, or object to the trouble of rearing chickens, keep only those\r\nbreeds that are non-sitters, as the Hamburgs, Polands, and Spanish; but\r\nyou must purchase younger birds from time to time to keep a supply of\r\nlaying hens while others are moulting.\r\n\r\nWarmth is most essential for promoting laying. A severe frost will\r\nsuddenly stop the laying of even the most prolific hens. \"When,\" says M.\r\nBosc, \"it is wished to have eggs during the cold season, even in the\r\ndead of winter, it is necessary to make the fowls roost over an oven, in\r\na stable, in a shed where many cattle are kept, or to erect a stove in\r\nthe fowl-house on purpose. By such methods, the farmers of Ange have\r\nchickens fit for the table in the month of April, a period when they are\r\nonly beginning to be hatched in the farms around Paris, although farther\r\nto the south.\" It is the winter management of fowls that decides the\r\nquestion of profit or loss, for hens will be sure to pay in the summer,\r\neven if only tolerably attended to. It is thought by many that each hen\r\ncan produce only a certain number of eggs; and if such be the case, it\r\nis very advantageous to obtain a portion of them in winter when they are\r\ngenerally scarce and can be eaten while fresh, instead of having the\r\nwhole number produced in the summer, when so many are spoiled from too\r\nlong keeping in consequence of more being produced than are required for\r\nuse at the time.\r\n\r\nWhen the time for her laying approaches, her comb and wattles change\r\nfrom their previous dull hue to a bright red, the eye brightens, the\r\ngait becomes more spirited, and sometimes she cackles for three or four\r\ndays. After laying her egg on leaving the nest the hen utters a loud\r\ncackling cry, to which the cock often responds in a high-pitched kind of\r\nscream; but some hens after laying leave the nest in silence. Some hens\r\nwill lay an egg in three days, some every other day, and others every\r\nday. Hens should not be forced. By unnaturally forcing a fowl with\r\nstimulating food, and more particularly with hempseed and tallow\r\ngreaves, to lay in two years or so the eggs that should have been the\r\nproduce of several, the hen becomes prematurely old and diseased; and it\r\nis reasonable to suppose that the eggs are not so good as they would\r\nhave been if nature had been left to run its own course. The eggs ought\r\nto be taken from the nest every afternoon when no more may be expected\r\nto be laid; for if left in the nest, the heat of the hens when laying\r\nnext day will tend to corrupt them.\r\n\r\nWhen the shells of the eggs are somewhat soft, it is because the hens\r\nare rather inclined to grow too fat. It is then proper to mix up a\r\nlittle chalk in their water, and to put a little mortar rubbish in their\r\nfood, the quantity of which should be diminished. We give the following\r\nremarks by an experienced poultry-keeper of the old school, as valuable\r\nfrom being the result of practice: \"The hen sometimes experiences a\r\ndifficulty in laying. In this case a few grains of salt or garlic put\r\ninto the vent have been successfully tried. The keeper should indeed\r\nmake use of the latter mode to find out the place where a hen has laid\r\nwithout his knowledge; for, as the hen will be in haste to deposit her\r\negg, her pace towards the nest will be quickened; she may then be\r\nfollowed and her secret found out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Though one particular form,\" says Mr. Dickson, \"is so common to eggs,\r\nthat it is known by the familiar name of egg-shaped, yet all keepers of\r\npoultry must be aware that eggs are sometimes nearly round, and\r\nsometimes almost cylindrical, besides innumerable minor shades of\r\ndifference. In fact, eggs differ so much in shape, that it is said\r\nexperienced poultry-keepers can tell by the shape of the eggs alone the\r\nhen that laid them; for, strange to say, however different in size the\r\neggs of any particular hen may be occasionally, they are very rarely\r\ndifferent in form. Among the most remarkable eggs may be mentioned those\r\nof the Shanghae, or Cochin-China fowl, which are of a pale chocolate\r\ncolour; and those of the Dorking fowl, which are of a pure white, and\r\nnearly as round as balls. The eggs of the Malay fowls are brown; those\r\nof the Polish fowl, which are very much pointed at one end, are of a\r\ndelicate pinkish white; and those of the Bantam are of a long oval.\"\r\n\r\nA very important part of the egg is the air-bag, or _folliculus aeris_,\r\nwhich is placed at the larger end, between the shell and its lining\r\nmembranes. It is, according to Dr. Paris, about the size of the eye of a\r\nsmall bird in new laid eggs, but enlarges to ten times that size during\r\nthe process of incubation. \"This air-bag,\" says Mr. Dickson, \"is of such\r\ngreat importance to the development of the chick, probably by supplying\r\nit with a limited atmosphere of oxygen, that if the blunt end of the egg\r\nbe pierced with the point of the smallest needle (a stratagem which\r\nmalice not unfrequently suggests), the egg cannot be hatched, but\r\nperishes.\"\r\n\r\nAn egg exposed to the air is continually losing a portion of its\r\nmoisture, the place of which is filled by the entrance of air, and the\r\negg consequently becomes stale, and after a time putrid. M. Reaumur made\r\nmany experiments in preserving eggs, and found that, by coating them\r\nwith varnish, it was impossible to distinguish those which had been kept\r\nfor a year from those newly laid; but varnish, though not expensive, is\r\nnot always to be had in country places, and it also remained on the eggs\r\nplaced under a hen and impeded the hatching, while in boiling them, the\r\nvarnish, not being soluble in hot water, prevented them from being\r\nproperly cooked. He tried other substances, and found that fat or\r\ngrease, such as suet, lard, dripping, butter, and oil, were well adapted\r\nfor the purpose, the best of these being a mixture of mutton and beef\r\nsuet thoroughly melted together over a slow fire, and strained through\r\na linen cloth into an earthen pan. It is only requisite, he says, to\r\ntake a piece of the fat or butter about the size of a pea on the end of\r\nthe finger, and rub it all over the shell, by passing and repassing the\r\nfinger so that no part be left untouched; the transpiration of matter\r\nfrom the egg being as effectually stopped by the thinnest layer of fat\r\nor grease as by a thick coating, so that no part of the shell be left\r\nungreased, or the tip of the finger may be dipped into oil and passed\r\nover the shell in the same manner. If it is desired that the eggs should\r\nlook clean, they may be afterwards wiped with a towel, for sufficient\r\ngrease or oil enters the pores of the shell to prevent all transpiration\r\nwithout its being necessary that any should be left to fill up the\r\nspaces between the pores. They can be boiled as usual without rubbing\r\noff the fat, as it will melt in the hot water, and when taken out of the\r\nwater the little grease that is left upon the egg is easily wiped off\r\nwith a napkin.\r\n\r\nEggs preserved in this manner can also be used for hatching, as the fat\r\neasily melts away by the heat of the hen; and by this means the eggs of\r\nforeign fowls might be carried to a distance, hatched, and naturalised\r\nin this and other countries. The French also find that a mixture of\r\nmelted beeswax and olive oil is an excellent preservative.\r\n\r\nEggs may also be preserved for cooking by packing them in sawdust, in an\r\nearthen vessel, and covering the top with melted mutton suet or fat; as\r\nfruit is sometimes preserved. They are also said to keep well in salt,\r\nin a barrel arranged in layers of salt and eggs alternately. If the salt\r\nshould become damp, it would penetrate through the pores of the shell\r\nand pickle them to a certain extent. M. Gagne says that eggs may be\r\npreserved in a mixture made of one bushel of quick-lime, two pounds of\r\nsalt, and eight ounces of cream of tartar, with sufficient water to make\r\nit into a paste of a consistency to receive the eggs, which, it is said,\r\nmay be kept in it fresh for two years; but eggs become tasteless when\r\npreserved with lime. It may be as well to mention here that eggs are\r\ncomparatively wasted when used in making a rice pudding, as they render\r\nit too hard and dry, and the pudding without them, if properly made,\r\nwill be just of the right consistency.\r\n\r\n\"Another way to preserve eggs,\" says Mr. Dickson, \"is to have them\r\ncooked in boiling water the same day they are laid. On taking them out\r\nof the water they are marked with red ink, to record their date, and put\r\naway in a cool place, where they will keep, it is said, for several\r\nmonths. When they are wanted for use, they are again put into hot water\r\nto warm them. The curdy part which is usually seen in new-laid eggs is\r\nso abundant, and the taste is said to be so well preserved, that the\r\nnicest people may be made to believe that they are new laid. At the end\r\nof three or four months, however, the membrane lining the shell becomes\r\nmuch thickened, and the eggs lose their flavour. Eggs so preserved have\r\nthe advantage of not suffering from being carried about.\"\r\n\r\n\"It ought not to be overlooked,\" says Mr. Dickson, \"with respect to the\r\npreservation of eggs, that they not only spoil by the transpiration of\r\ntheir moisture and the putrid fermentation of their contents, in\r\nconsequence of air penetrating through the pores of the shell; but also\r\nby being moved about, and jostled when carried to a distance by sea or\r\nland. Any sort of rough motion indeed ruptures the membranes which keep\r\nthe white, the yolk, and the germ of the chick in their proper places,\r\nand upon these becoming mixed, putrefaction soon follows.\"\r\n\r\nIf the eggs are to be kept for setting, place a box, divided by\r\npartitions into divisions for the eggs of the different breeds, in a dry\r\ncorner of your kitchen, but not too near to the fire; fill the divisions\r\nwith bran previously well dried in an oven; place the eggs in it\r\nupright, with the larger ends uppermost, as soon as they are laid, and\r\ncover them with the bran. Mark each egg in pencil with the date when\r\nlaid, and description of breed or cross. They should be kept in a cool\r\nplace or a warm place according to the season. Airtight jars, closed\r\nwith airtight stoppers, may be used if the eggs are intended to be kept\r\nfor a very long time.\r\n\r\nIn selecting eggs for setting, choose the freshest, those of moderate\r\nsize, well-shaped, and having the air-vessel distinctly visible, either\r\nin the centre of the top of the egg, or slightly to the side, when the\r\negg is held between the eye and a lighted candle, in a darkened room.\r\nReject very small eggs, which generally have no yolk, those that are\r\nill-shaped, and those of equal thickness at both ends, which latter is\r\nthe usual shape of eggs with double yolks. These should be avoided, as\r\nthey are apt generally to prove unfertile, or produce monstrosities.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the sex of the embryo chicken can be ascertained\r\nby the position of the air-vessel; that if it be on the top the egg will\r\nproduce a cockerel, and if on the side a pullet; but there is no proof\r\nof the truth of this, and, notwithstanding such assertions, it appears\r\nto be impossible to foretell the sex of the chick, from the shape of the\r\negg or in any other way.\r\n\r\nIn selecting eggs for the purpose of producing fowls that are to be kept\r\nfor laying only, being non-sitters, choose eggs only from those hens\r\nthat are prolific layers, for prolific laying is often as characteristic\r\nof some fowls of a breed as it is of the particular breeds, and by\r\ncareful selection this faculty, like others, may be further developed,\r\nor continued if already fully developed.\r\n\r\nIf carefully packed, eggs for setting may be carried great\r\ndistances--hundreds and even thousands of miles--without injury;\r\nvibration and even moderate shaking, and very considerable changes of\r\ntemperature, producing no ill effect upon the germ. The chief point is\r\nto prevent the escape of moisture by evaporation, and consequent\r\nadmission of air. A hamper travels with less vibration than a box, and\r\nis therefore preferable, especially for a long journey. They should be\r\npacked in hay, by which they will be preserved from breakage much better\r\nthan by being packed in short, close material like bran, chaff, oats, or\r\nsawdust; these being shaken into smaller space by the vibration of\r\ntravelling, the eggs often strike and crack each other. The hamper or\r\nbox should be large enough to admit of some soft, yielding packing\r\nmaterial being placed all round the eggs. The bottom should be first\r\ncovered with a good layer of hay, straw, or moss. It is a good plan to\r\nroll each egg separately in hay or moss, fastened with a little wool or\r\nworsted. They should be covered with well-rubbed straw, pressed down\r\ncarefully and gently. The lid of the hamper should be sewed on tightly\r\nall round, or in three or four places at least. If a box is used, the\r\nlid should be fastened by cords or screws, but not with nails, as the\r\nhammering would probably destroy the germ of the egg.\r\n\r\nIn procuring eggs for hatching, be sure that the parent birds are of\r\nmature age, but not too old, well-shaped, vigorous, and in perfect\r\nhealth; that one cock is kept to every six or seven hens; and that they\r\nare well fed and attended to. Have a steady broody hen ready to take the\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE SITTING HEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll hens that are inclined to sit should be allowed to hatch and bring\r\nup one brood of chickens a year; for, if altogether restrained from\r\nsitting, a hen suffers much in moulting, and is restless and excited for\r\nthe remainder of the season. It is unnatural, and therefore must be\r\ninjurious. The period of incubation gives her rest from producing eggs.\r\nThe hen that is always stimulated to produce eggs, and not allowed to\r\nvary that process by hatching and bringing up a young brood, must\r\nultimately suffer from this constant drain upon her system, and the eggs\r\nare said to be unwholesome.\r\n\r\nBut hens frequently wish to sit when it is not convenient, or in autumn\r\nor winter, when it is not advisable, unless very late or early chickens\r\nare desired, and every attention can be given to them. To check this\r\ndesire, the old-fashioned plan with farmers' wives, of plunging the\r\nbroody hen into cold water, and keeping her there for some minutes, was\r\nnot only a cruel practice, but often failed to effect its object, and\r\nmust naturally always have caused ultimate disease in the poor bird.\r\nWhen it is absolutely necessary to check the desire of a hen to sit, the\r\nbest plan is to let her sit on some nest-eggs for a week, then remove\r\nand coop her for a few days, away from the place where she made her\r\nnest, low diet, as boiled potatoes and boiled rice, and water being\r\nplaced near; meanwhile taking away the eggs and destroying the nest,\r\nand, not finding it on her return, she will generally not seek for\r\nanother, unless she is a Cochin, or the desire exceedingly strong.\r\n\r\nWhen a hen wishes to sit, she utters a peculiar cluck, ruffles her\r\nfeathers, wanders about, searches obscure corners and recesses, is very\r\nfidgety, feverishly hot, impatient, anxiously restless, and seeks for a\r\nnest. Highly-fed hens feel this desire sooner than those that are not so\r\nhighly fed. A hen may be induced to sit at any season, by confining her\r\nin a dark room in a covered basket, only large enough to contain her\r\nnest, keeping her warm, and feeding her on stimulating food, such as\r\nbread steeped in ale, a little raw liver or fresh meat chopped small,\r\nand potatoes mashed warm with milk and oatmeal.\r\n\r\nEvery large poultry establishment should have a separate house for the\r\nsitting hens, and the run that should be provided for their relaxation\r\nmust be divided from that of the other fowls by wire or lattice work, to\r\nprevent any intrusion. Where there is a large number of sitting hens,\r\neach nest should be numbered, and the date of setting, number and\r\ndescription of eggs, entered in a diary or memorandum book opposite to\r\nthe number; and the number of chickens hatched, and any particulars\r\nlikely to be useful on a future occasion, should afterwards be entered.\r\n\r\nA separate house and run for each sitting hen is a great advantage, as\r\nit prevents other hens from going to the nest during her absence, or\r\nherself from returning to the wrong nest, as will often happen in a\r\ncommon house. The run should not be large, or the hen may be inclined to\r\nwander and stay away too long from her nest. A separate division for the\r\nsitting hen is often otherwise useful, for the purpose of keeping the\r\ncock apart from the hens, or for keeping a few additional birds for\r\nwhich accommodation has not been prepared, or for the use of a pen of\r\nbirds about to be sent for exhibition.\r\n\r\n\"Boxes, of which every carpenter knows the form,\" says Mowbray, \"are to\r\nbe arranged round the walls, and it is proper to have a sufficient\r\nnumber, the hens being apt to dispute possession, and sit upon one\r\nanother. The board or step at the entrance should be of sufficient\r\nheight to prevent the eggs from rolling out. Provision of a few railed\r\ndoors may be made for occasional use, to be hung before the entrance, in\r\norder to prevent other hens from intruding to lay their eggs upon those\r\nwhich sit, a habit to which some are much addicted, and by which a brood\r\nis often injured. The common deep square boxes, uncovered at top, are\r\nextremely improper, because that form obliges the hen to jump down upon\r\nher eggs, whereas for safety she should descend upon them from a very\r\nsmall height, or in a manner walk in upon them. The same objection lies\r\nagainst hampers, with the additional one of the wicker-work admitting\r\nthe cold in variable weather, during winter or early spring sittings.\r\nMany breeders prefer to have all the nests upon the ground, on account\r\nof the danger of chickens falling from the nests which are placed\r\nabove.\" The ground is preferable for other reasons. The damp arising\r\nfrom the ground assists very materially in incubation. When fowls sit\r\nupon wooden floors, or in boxes, the eggs become so dry and parched as\r\nto prevent the chicken from disencumbering itself of the shell, and it\r\nis liable to perish in its attempts. Hens in a state of nature make\r\ntheir nests upon the ground; and fowls, when left to choose a nest for\r\nthemselves, generally fix upon a hedge, where the hen conceals herself\r\nunder the branches of the hedge, and among the grass. In general, the\r\nsitting places are too close and confined, and very different in this\r\nrespect to those that hens select for themselves.\r\n\r\nBut nests cannot always be allowed to be made on the ground, unless\r\nproperly secured from vermin, particularly from rats, which will\r\nfrequently convey away the whole of the eggs from under a hen. And other\r\nconsiderations may render it necessary to have them on a floor, in boxes\r\non the ground, or placed above; in which cases the eggs must be kept\r\nproperly moistened, for, unless the egg is kept sufficiently damp, its\r\ninner membrane becomes so hard and dry that the chicken cannot break\r\nthrough, and perishes. When a hen steals her nest in a hedge or clump of\r\nevergreens or bushes, she makes it on the damp ground. She goes in\r\nsearch of food early in the morning, before the dew is off the grass,\r\nand returns to her nest with her feathers saturated with moisture. This\r\nis the cause of the comparatively successful hatching of the eggs of\r\nwild birds. The old farmers' wives did not understand the necessity of\r\ndamping eggs, but frequently complained of their not hatching, although\r\nchickens were found in them, which was, in most cases, entirely caused\r\nby want of damping. If, therefore, the weather is warm and wet, all will\r\nprobably go well; but if the air should be very dry, moisture must be\r\nimparted by sprinkling the nest and eggs slightly, when the hen is off\r\nfeeding, by means of a small brush dipped in tepid water. A small flat\r\nbrush such as is used by painters is excellent for this purpose, as it\r\ndoes not distribute the water too freely. The ground round about, also,\r\nshould be watered with hot water, to cause a steam. But the natural\r\nmoisture of a damp soil is preferable, and never fails.\r\n\r\nThe nest may be of any shape. A long box divided by partitions into\r\nseveral compartments is much used, but separate boxes or baskets are\r\npreferable as being more easily cleaned and freed from vermin. Wooden\r\nnest-boxes are preferable to wicker baskets in winter, as the latter let\r\nin the cold air, but many prefer wicker baskets in summer for their\r\nairiness. A round glazed earthen pan, with shelving sides, like those\r\nused in the midland counties for milk, and partially filled with moss,\r\nforms a good nest, the moss being easier kept moist in such a pan than\r\nin a box. The nest should be made so large that the hen can just fill\r\nit, not very deep, and as nearly flat inside at the bottom as possible,\r\nso that the eggs may not lean against each other, or they may get\r\nbroken, especially by the hen turning them.\r\n\r\nThe best filling for hatching nests is fine dry sand, mould, coal or\r\nwood ashes placed on a cut turf, covering it and lining the sides with a\r\nlittle well-broken dry grass, moss, bruised straw, lichen, or liverwort\r\ncollected from trees, or dry heather, which is the best of all, but\r\ncannot always be had. Hay, though soft at first, soon becomes hard and\r\nmatted, and is also said to breed vermin. Straw is good material, but\r\nmust be cut into short pieces, for if long straw is used and the hen\r\nshould catch her foot in it, and drag it after her when she leaves the\r\nnest, it will disturb, if not break, the eggs. The nests of the sitting\r\nhens in Her Majesty's poultry-yard at Windsor are made of heather,\r\nwhich offers an excellent medium between the natural damp hedge-nest of\r\nthe hen and the dryness of a box filled with straw, and also enables her\r\nto free herself from those insects which are so troublesome to sitting\r\nhens. A thick layer of ashes placed under the straw in cold weather will\r\nkeep in the heat of the hen. A little Scotch snuff is a good thing to\r\nkeep the nests free from vermin.\r\n\r\nWhere only a few fowls are kept, and a separate place cannot be found\r\nfor the sitting hen, she can be placed on a nest which should be covered\r\nover with a coop, closed in with a little boarding or some other\r\ncontrivance for a day or two, to prevent her being disturbed by any\r\nother fowls that have been accustomed to lay there. They will then soon\r\nuse another nest. She should be carefully lifted off her nest, by taking\r\nhold of her under the wings, regularly every morning, exercised and fed,\r\nand then shut in, so that she cannot be annoyed.\r\n\r\nIt is best to allow a hen to keep the nest she has chosen when she shows\r\nan inclination to sit; and if she continues to sit steadily, and has not\r\na sufficient number of eggs under her, or the eggs you desire her to\r\nhatch, remove her gently at night, replace the eggs with the proper\r\nbatch, and place her quietly upon the nest again. Hens are very fond of\r\nchoosing their own nests in out of the way places; and where the spot is\r\nnot unsafe, or too much exposed to the weather, it is best to let her\r\nkeep possession, for it has been noticed that, when she selects her own\r\nnest and manages for herself, she generally brings forth a good and\r\nnumerous brood. Mr. Tegetmeier observes that he has \"reason to believe,\r\nindeed, that whatever care may be taken in keeping eggs, their vitality\r\nis better preserved when they are allowed to remain in the nest. Perhaps\r\nthe periodical visits of the hen, while adding to her store of eggs, has\r\na stimulating influence. The warmth communicated in the half-hour during\r\nwhich she occupies the nest may have a tendency to preserve the embryo\r\nin a vigorous state.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan, before giving an untried hen choice eggs, to let her\r\nsit upon a few chalk or stale eggs for a few days, and if she continue\r\nto sit with constancy, then to give her the batch for hatching. When\r\nchoice can be made out of several broody hens for a valuable batch of\r\neggs, one should be selected with rather short legs, a broad body, large\r\nwings well furnished with feathers, and having the nails and spurs not\r\ntoo long or sharp. As a rule, hens which are the best layers are the\r\nworst sitters, and those with short legs are good sitters, while\r\nlong-legged hens are not. Dorkings are the best sitters of all breeds,\r\nand by high feeding may be induced to sit in October, especially if they\r\nhave moulted early, and with great care and attention chickens may be\r\nreared and made fit for table by Christmas. Early in the spring Dorkings\r\nonly should be employed as mothers, for they remain much longer with\r\ntheir chickens than the Cochin-Chinas, but the latter may safely be\r\nentrusted with a brood after April. Cochins are excellent sitters, and,\r\nfrom the quantity of \"fluff\" which is peculiar to them, keep the eggs at\r\na high and regular degree of heat. Their short legs also are\r\nadvantageous for sitting. A Cochin hen can always be easily induced to\r\nsit, and eggs of theirs or of Brahma Pootras for sitting, are not wanted\r\nin the coldest weather.\r\n\r\nOld hens are more steady sitters than pullets, more fond of their brood,\r\nand not so apt as pullets to leave them too soon. Indeed, pullets were\r\nformerly never allowed to sit before the second year of their laying,\r\nbut now many eminent authorities think it best to let them sit when they\r\nshow a strong desire to do so, considering that the prejudice against\r\nthem upon this point is unfounded, and that young hens sit as well as\r\nolder fowls. Pullets hatched early will generally begin to lay in\r\nNovember or December, if kept warm and well fed, and will sit in January\r\nor February.\r\n\r\nBroody hens brought from a distance should be carried in a basket,\r\ncovered over with a cloth.\r\n\r\nThe number of eggs to be set under a hen must be according to the extent\r\nof her wings and the temperature of the weather. Some say that the\r\nnumber may vary from nine to fourteen, but others would never give more\r\nthan nine in winter and early spring, and eleven in summer, to the\r\nlargest hen, and two fewer to the smaller fowls. A Cochin-China may have\r\nfifteen of her own in summer. A hen should not be allowed more eggs than\r\nshe can completely cover; for eggs that are not thoroughly covered\r\nbecome chilled, and fewer and weaker chickens will be hatched from too\r\nlarge a number than from a more moderate allowance. It is not only\r\nnecessary to consider how many eggs a hen can hatch, but also how many\r\nchickens she can cover when they are partly grown. In January and\r\nFebruary, not more than seven or eight eggs should be placed under the\r\nhen, as she cannot cover more than that number of chickens when they\r\ngrow large, and exposure to the cold during the long winter nights would\r\ndestroy many. \"The common order to set egges,\" says Mascall, \"is in\r\nodde numbers, as seven, nyne, eleven, thirteen, &c., whiche is to make\r\nthem lye round the neste, and to have the odde egge in the middest.\"\r\n\r\nEggs for sitting should be under a fortnight old, if possible, and never\r\nmore than a month. Fresh eggs hatch in proper time, and, if good,\r\nproduce strong, lively chicks; while stale eggs are hatched sometimes as\r\nmuch as two days later than new laid, and the chickens are often too\r\nweak to break the shell, while of those well out fewer will probably be\r\nreared. It is certain, as a general rule, that the older the egg the\r\nweaker will be its progeny. Every egg should be marked by a pencil or\r\nink line drawn quite round it, so that it can be known without touching,\r\nand if another be laid afterwards it may be at once detected and\r\nremoved, for hens will sometimes lay several after they have commenced\r\nsitting. Place the eggs under the hen with their larger ends uppermost.\r\n\r\nLet the hen be well fed and supplied with water before putting her on\r\nthe nest. Whole barley and soft food, chiefly barley-meal and mashed\r\npotatoes, should be given to her when she comes off the nest, and she\r\nmust have as much as she will eat, for she leaves the nest but once\r\ndaily, and the full heat of the body cannot be kept up without plenty of\r\nfood; or she may have the same food as the general stock. A good supply\r\nof water must be always within her reach. A good-sized shallow box or\r\npan, containing fine coal-ashes, sand, or dry earth, to cleanse herself\r\nin, should always be ready near to the nest. She should be left\r\nundisturbed, and, as far as possible, allowed to manage her own\r\nbusiness. When a hen shows impatience of her confinement, and frequently\r\nleaves the nest, M. Parmentier advises that half only of her usual meal\r\nshould be given, after which she should be replaced on the nest and fed\r\nfrom the hand with hemp or millet seed, which will induce her to stay\r\nconstantly on her eggs. Others will sit so long and closely that they\r\nbecome faint for want of food. Such hens should not be fed on the nest,\r\nbut gently induced with some tempting dainty to take a little exercise,\r\nfor they will not leave their eggs of their own accord, and feeding on\r\nthe nest has crippled many a good sitter. It is not healthy for the hen\r\nto feed while sitting on or close by the nest, for she requires a little\r\nexercise and rolling in the dust-heap, as well as that the eggs should\r\nbe exposed for the air to carry off any of that stagnant vapour which M.\r\nReaumur proved to be so destructive to the embryo chickens; and it has\r\nalso been shown by physiologists that the cooling of the eggs caused by\r\nthis absence of the hen is essential to allow a supply of air to\r\npenetrate through the pores of the shell, for the respiration of the\r\nchick. When there are many hens sitting at the same time, it is a good\r\nplan to take them off their nests regularly at the same time every\r\nmorning to feed, and afterwards give them an opportunity to cleanse\r\nthemselves in a convenient dusting-place, and, if possible, allow them\r\nexercise in a good grass run. A hen should never be caught, but driven\r\nback gently to her nest.\r\n\r\nA good hen will not stay away more than half an hour, unless infested\r\nwith vermin, from want of having a proper dust-heap. But hens have often\r\nbeen absent for more than an hour, and yet have hatched seven or eight\r\nchickens; and instances have been known of their being absent for five\r\nand even for nine hours, and yet hatching a few. The following\r\nremarkable instance is recorded by an excellent authority: \"Eggs had\r\nbeen supplied and a sitting hen lent to a neighbour, and, when she had\r\nset in a granary ten days, she was shut out through the carelessness of\r\na servant. Being a stranger in the farmyard, the hen was not recognised,\r\nbut supposed to have strayed in from an adjoining walk, and thirty hours\r\nelapsed before it was discovered that the hen had left her nest. The\r\nfarmer's wife despaired of her brood; but, to her surprise and pleasure,\r\neight chickens were hatched. The tiled roof of the granary was fully\r\nexposed to the rays of the sun, and the temperature very high, probably\r\nabove 80 deg. during the day, and not much lower at night.\" Valuable\r\neggs, therefore, should not be abandoned on account of a rather\r\nlengthened absence; and ordinary eggs should not be discarded as\r\nworthless if the hen has already sat upon them for a fortnight or so;\r\nbut if she has been sitting for only a few days, it is safer to throw\r\nthem away, and have a fresh batch.\r\n\r\nDuring the hen's absence, always look at the eggs, remove any that may\r\nhave been broken, and very gently wash any sticky or dirty eggs with a\r\nflannel dipped in milk-warm water. See that they are dry before putting\r\nthem back. If the nest is also dirty, replace it with fresh material of\r\nthe same kind. Gently drive the hen back to her nest as quickly as\r\npossible, to prevent any damage from the eggs becoming chilled. If a hen\r\nshould break an egg with her feet or otherwise, it should be removed as\r\nsoon as it is seen, or she may eat it, and, liking the taste, break and\r\neat the others. Some hens have a bad habit of breaking and eating the\r\neggs on which they are sitting, to cure which some recommend to boil an\r\negg hard, bore a few holes in it, so that the inside can be seen, and\r\ngive it while hot to the culprit, who will peck at the holes and burn\r\nherself; but hens with such propensities should be fattened for the\r\ntable, for they are generally useless either for sitting or laying.\r\n\r\nSome persons examine the eggs after the hen has sat upon them for six or\r\nseven days, and remove all that are sterile, by which plan more warmth\r\nand space are gained for those that are fertile, and the warmth is not\r\nwasted upon barren eggs. They may be easily proved by holding them near\r\nto the flame of a candle, the eye being kept shaded by one hand, when\r\nthe fertile eggs will appear dark and the sterile transparent. Another\r\nplan is to place the eggs on a drum, or between the hands, in the\r\nsunshine, and observe the shadow. If this wavers, by the motion of the\r\nchick, the eggs are good; but if the shadow shows no motion, they are\r\nunfertile. If two hens have been sitting during the same time, and many\r\nunfertile eggs are found in the two nests, all the fertile eggs should\r\nbe placed under one hen, and a fresh batch given to the other. The eggs\r\nshould not be moved after this time, except by the hen, more especially\r\nwhen incubation has proceeded for some time, lest the position of the\r\nchick be interfered with, for if taken up a little time before its exit,\r\nand incautiously replaced with the large end lowermost, the chicken,\r\nfrom its position, will not be able to chip the shell, and must\r\ntherefore perish. The forepart of the chicken is towards the biggest end\r\nof the egg, and it is so placed in the shell that the beak is always\r\nuppermost. When the egg of a choice breed has been cracked towards the\r\nend of the period of incubation, the crack may be covered with a slip of\r\ngummed paper, or the unprinted border that is round a sheet of postage\r\nstamps, and the damaged egg will probably yet produce a fine chick.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to set two hens on the same day, for the two broods\r\nmay be united under one if desirable, and on the hatching day, to\r\nprevent the newly-born chickens being crushed by the unhatched eggs, all\r\nthat are hatched can be given to one hen, and the other take charge of\r\nthe eggs, which are then more likely to be hatched, as, while the\r\nchickens are under the hen, she will sit higher from the eggs, and\r\nafford them less warmth when they require it most.\r\n\r\nThe hen of all kinds of gallinaceous fowls, from the Bantam to the\r\nCochin-China, sits for twenty-one days, at which time, on an average,\r\nthe chickens break the shell; but if the eggs are new laid it will often\r\nlessen the time by five or six hours, while stale eggs will always be\r\nbehind time. For the purpose of breaking the shell, the yet soft beak of\r\nthe chicken is furnished, just above the point of the upper mandible,\r\nwith a small, hard, horny scale, which, from the position of the head,\r\nas Mr. Yarrell observes, is brought in contact with the inner surface of\r\nthe shell. This scale may be always seen on the beaks of newly-hatched\r\nchickens, but in the course of a short time peels off. It should not be\r\nremoved. The peculiar sound, incorrectly called \"tapping,\" so\r\nperceptible within the egg about the nineteenth day of incubation, which\r\nwas universally believed to be produced by the bill of the chick\r\nstriking against the shell in order to break it and effect its release,\r\nhas been incontestably proved, by the late Dr. F. R. Horner, of Hull, in\r\na paper read by him before the British Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science, to be a totally distinct sound, being nothing more than the\r\nnatural respiratory sound in the lungs of the young chick, which first\r\nbegins to breathe at that period. Of course there is also an occasional\r\nsound made by the tapping of the beak in endeavouring to break the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nThe time occupied in breaking the shell varies, according to the\r\nstrength of the chick, from one to three hours usually, but extends\r\nsometimes to twenty-four, and even more. \"I have seen,\" says Reaumur,\r\n\"chicks continue at work for two days together; some work incessantly,\r\nwhile others take rest at intervals, according to their physical\r\nstrength. Some, I have observed, begin to break the shell a great deal\r\ntoo soon; for, be it observed, they ought, before they make their exit,\r\nto have within them provision enough to serve for twenty-four hours\r\nwithout taking food, and for this purpose the unconsumed portion of the\r\nyolk enters through the navel. The chick, indeed, which comes out of the\r\nshell without taking up all the yolk is certain to droop and die in a\r\nfew days after it is hatched. The assistance which I have occasionally\r\ntried to give to several of them, by way of completing their\r\ndeliverance, has afforded me an opportunity of observing those which had\r\nbegun to break their shells before this was accomplished; and I have\r\nopened many eggs much fractured, in each of which the chick had as yet\r\nmuch of the yolk not absorbed. Some chicks have greater obstacles to\r\novercome than others, since all shells are not of an equal thickness nor\r\nof an equal consistence; and the same inequality takes place in the\r\nlining membrane, and offers still greater difficulty to the emergent\r\nchick. The shells of the eggs of birds of various species are of a\r\nthickness proportionate to the strength of the chick that is obliged to\r\nbreak through them. The canary-bird would never be able to break the\r\nshell it is enclosed in if that were as thick as the egg of a barn-door\r\nfowl. The chick of a barn-door fowl, again, would in vain try to break\r\nits shell if it were as thick and hard as that of an ostrich; indeed,\r\nthough an ostrich ready to be hatched is perhaps thrice as large as the\r\ncommon chick, it is not easy to conceive how the force of its bill can\r\nbe strong enough to break a shell thicker than a china cup, and the\r\nsmoothness and gloss of which indicate that it is nearly as\r\nhard--sufficiently so to form, as may be often seen, a firm\r\ndrinking-cup. It is the practice in some countries to dip the eggs into\r\nwarm water at the time they are expected to chip, on the supposition\r\nthat the shell is thereby rendered more fragile, and the labour of the\r\nchick lightened. But, though the water should soften it, upon drying in\r\nthe air it would become as hard as at first. When the chick is entirely\r\nor almost out of the shell, it draws its head from under its wing, where\r\nit had hitherto been placed, stretches out its neck, directing it\r\nforwards, but for several minutes is unable to raise it. On seeing for\r\nthe first time a chick in this condition, we are led to infer that its\r\nstrength is exhausted, and that it is ready to expire; but in most cases\r\nit recruits rapidly, its organs acquire strength, and in a very short\r\ntime it appears quite another creature. After having dragged itself on\r\nits legs a little while, it becomes capable of standing on them, and of\r\nlifting up its neck and bending it in various directions, and at length\r\nof holding up its head. At this period the feathers are merely fine\r\ndown, but, as they are wet with the fluid of the egg, the chick appears\r\nalmost naked. From the multitude of their branchlets these down\r\nfeathers resemble minute shrubs; when, however, these branchlets are wet\r\nand sticking to each other, they take up but very little room; as they\r\ndry they become disentangled and separated. The branchlets, plumules, or\r\nbeards of each feather are at first enclosed in a membranous tube, by\r\nwhich they are pressed and kept close together; but as soon as this\r\ndries it splits asunder, an effect assisted also by the elasticity of\r\nthe plumules themselves, which causes them to recede and spread\r\nthemselves out. This being accomplished, each down feather extends over\r\na considerable space, and when they all become dry and straight, the\r\nchick appears completely clothed in a warm vestment of soft down.\"\r\n\r\nIf they are not out in a few hours after the shell has been broken, and\r\nthe hole is not enlarged, they are probably glued to the shell. Look\r\nthrough the egg then, and, if all the yolk has passed into the body of\r\nthe chicken, you may assist it by enlarging the fracture with a pair of\r\nfine scissors, cutting up towards the large end of the egg, never\r\ndownwards. \"If,\" says Miss Watts, \"the time has arrived when the chicken\r\nmay with safety be liberated, there will be no appearance of blood in\r\nthe minute blood-vessels spread over the interior of the shell; they\r\nhave done their work, and are no longer needed by the now fully\r\ndeveloped and breathing chick. If there should be the slightest\r\nappearance of blood, resist at once, for its escape would generally be\r\nfatal. Do not attempt to let the chicken out at once, but help it a\r\nlittle every two or three hours. The object is not to hurry the chicken\r\nout of its shell, but to prevent its being suffocated by being close\r\nshut up within it. If the chick is tolerably strong, and the assistance\r\nneedful, it will aid its deliverance with its own exertions.\" When the\r\nchicken at last makes its way out, do not interfere with it in any way,\r\nor attempt to feed it. Animal heat alone can restore it. Weakness has\r\ncaused the delay, and this has probably arisen from insufficient warmth,\r\nperhaps from the hen having had too many eggs to cover thoroughly, or\r\nthey may have been stale when set. Should you have to assist it out of\r\nthe shell, take it out gently with your fingers, taking great care not\r\nto tear any of its tender skin, when freeing the feathers from the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nMr. Wright says: \"We never ourselves now attempt to assist a chick from\r\nthe shell. If the eggs were fresh, and proper care has been taken to\r\npreserve moisture during incubation, no assistance is ever needed. To\r\nfuss about the nest frets the hen exceedingly; and we have always found\r\nthat, even where the poor little creature survived at the time, it never\r\nlived to maturity. Should the reader attempt such assistance, in cases\r\nwhere an egg has been long chipped, and no further progress made, let\r\nthe shell be cracked gently all round, without tearing the inside\r\nmembrane; if that be perforated, the viscid fluid inside dries and glues\r\nthe chick to the shell. Should this happen, or should both shell and\r\nmembrane be perforated at first, introduce the point of a pair of\r\nscissors and cut up the egg towards the large end, where there will be\r\nan empty space, remembering that, if blood flows, all hope is at end.\r\nThen put the chick back under the hen; she will probably squeeze it to\r\ndeath, it is true--it is so very weak; but it will never live if put by\r\nthe fire, at least we always found it so. Indeed, as we have said, we\r\nconsider it quite useless to make the attempt at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is, it is scarcely worth while to attempt to assist in the case\r\nof ordinary eggs, but if the breed is valuable the labour may be well\r\nbestowed.\r\n\r\nSome hens are reluctant to give up sitting, and will hatch a second\r\nbrood with evident pleasure; but it is cruel to overtask their strength\r\nand patience, and they are sure to suffer, more or less, from the\r\nunnatural exertion.\r\n\r\nSome breeders use a contrivance called an \"artificial mother\" for broods\r\nhatched under the hen, and it may be employed very advantageously when\r\nany accident has happened to her. It is made in various forms, such as a\r\nwooden frame, or shallow box, open at both ends, and sloping like a\r\nwriting-desk, with a perforated lid lined with sheep or lamb's skin,\r\ngoose-down, or some similar warm fleecy material hanging down, under and\r\nbetween which the chickens nestle, heat being applied to the lid either\r\nby hot water or hot air, so as to imitate the warmth of the hen's\r\nbreast. When chickens are hatched by artificial means, such as by the\r\nHydro-Incubator, or the Eccaleobion, or in an oven according to the\r\nmethod practised by the Egyptians, these protectors are essential; for\r\nwithout a good substitute for the hen's natural warmth the chickens\r\nwould perish. Artificial incubators are now extensively used, and where\r\ngas is laid on they are easily managed, but the chief difficulty is in\r\nrearing the chickens. For information on the subject see the works of\r\nTegetmeier, Dickson, and Wright, on Poultry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nREARING AND FATTENING FOWLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first want which the chick will feel will be that of warmth, and\r\nthere is no warmth so suited for them as that of the hen's body. Some\r\npersons remove the chicks from under the mother as soon as they are\r\nhatched, one by one, placing them in a basket covered up with flannel,\r\nand keep them there in a warm place, until the last chick is out, when\r\nthey are put back under the hen. But this is very seldom necessary\r\nunless the weather is very cold and the hen restless, and is generally\r\nmore likely to annoy than benefit her. Nor should the hen be induced to\r\nleave the nest, but be left undisturbed until she leaves of her own\r\naccord, when the last hatched chickens will be in a better condition to\r\nfollow her than if she had been tempted to leave earlier. In a few hours\r\nthey are able to run about and follow their parent; they do not require\r\nto be fed in the nest like most birds, but pick up the food which their\r\nmother shows them; and repose at night huddled up beneath her wings. The\r\nchicken during its development in the egg is nourished by the yolk, and\r\nthe remaining portion of the yolk passes into its body previous to its\r\nleaving the shell, being designed for its first nourishment; and the\r\nchicken, therefore, does not require any food whatever during the first\r\nday. The old-fashioned plan, so popular with \"practical\" farmers' wives,\r\nof cramming a peppercorn down the throat of the newly-hatched chick is\r\nabsurd and injurious.\r\n\r\nThe first food must be very light and delicate, such as crumbs of bread\r\nsoaked in milk, the yolk of an egg boiled hard, and curds; but very\r\nlittle of anything at first except water, for thirst will come before\r\nhunger. The thirsty hen will herself soon teach the little ones how to\r\ndrink. If your chicks be very weakly, you may cram them with crumbs of\r\ngood white bread, steeped in milk or wine, but at the same time\r\nrecollect that their little craws are not capable of holding more than\r\nthe bulk of a pea; so rather under than over feed them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the hen leaves the nest, she should have as much grain as she\r\ncan eat, and a good supply of pure, clean water. In winter, or settled\r\nwet weather, she should, if possible, be kept on her nest for a day,\r\nand, when removed, be cooped in a warm, dry shed or outhouse; but in\r\nsummer, if the weather be fine, and the chickens well upon their legs,\r\nthey may be at once cooped out in the sun, on dry gravel, or if possible\r\non a nice grass-plot, with food and water within her reach. The hen is\r\ncooped to prevent her from wearying the brood by leading them about\r\nuntil they are over-tired, besides being exposed to danger from cats,\r\nhawks, and vermin, tumbling into ditches, or getting wet in the high\r\ngrass. They can pass in and out between the bars of the coop, and will\r\ncome when she calls, or they wish to shelter under her wings. It is a\r\ngood plan to place the coop for the first day out upon some dry sand, so\r\nthat the hen can cleanse herself comfortably. The common basket coop\r\nshould only be used in fine weather, and some straw, kept down by a\r\nstone, matting, or other covering, should be placed on the top, to\r\nshelter them from the mid-day sun; otherwise a wooden coop should be\r\nused, open in front only, about two and a half or three feet square;\r\nwell-made of stout, sound boards, with a gabled roof covered with felt;\r\nand at night a thick canvas or matting should be hung over the front,\r\nsufficient space being left for proper ventilation, but not to admit\r\ncold draught, or to allow the chicks to get out. Mr. Wright describes an\r\nexcellent coop which is \"very common in some parts of France, and\r\nconsists of two compartments, separated by a partition of bars, one\r\ncompartment being closed in front, the other fronted with bars like the\r\npartition. Each set of bars should have a sliding one to serve as a\r\ndoor, and the whole coop should be tight and sound. It is best to have\r\nno bottom, but to put it on loose dry earth or ashes, an inch or two\r\ndeep. Each half of the coop is about two feet six inches square, and may\r\nor may not be lighted from the top by a small pane of glass. The\r\nadvantage of such a coop is that, except in very severe weather, no\r\nfurther shelter is required, even at night [if placed under a shed].\r\nDuring the day the hen is kept in the outer compartment, the chickens\r\nhaving liberty, and the food and water being placed outside; whilst at\r\nnight she is put in the inner portion of the coop, and a piece of canvas\r\nor sacking hung over the bars of the outer half. If the top be glazed, a\r\nlittle food and the water-vessel may be placed in the outer compartment\r\nat night, and the chicks will be able to run out and feed early in the\r\nmorning, being prevented by the canvas from going out into the cold air.\r\nIt will be only needful to remove the coop every two days for a few\r\nminutes, to take away the tainted earth and replace it with fresh. There\r\nshould, if possible, be a grass-plot in front of the shed, the floor of\r\nwhich should be covered with dry, loose dust or earth.\" The hen should\r\nbe kept under a coop until the brood has grown strong. Some breeders\r\nobject to cooping, on account of its preventing the hen from scratching\r\nfor worms and insects for her brood, and which are far superior to the\r\nsubstitutes with which they must be supplied, unless, indeed, a good\r\nsupply of worms, ants' eggs, insects, or gentles can be had. The hen too\r\nhas not sufficient exercise after her long sitting. Cooping thus has its\r\nadvantages and disadvantages, and its adoption or not should depend upon\r\ncircumstances. If it is preferred not to coop the hen, and she should be\r\ninclined to roam too far, a small run may be made with network, or with\r\nthe moveable wire-work described on page 21.\r\n\r\nWinter-hatched chickens must be reared and fed in a warm place, which\r\nmust be kept at an equal temperature. They return a large profit for the\r\ngreat care they require in hatching and rearing.\r\n\r\nChickens should be fed very often; every two hours is not too\r\nfrequently. The number of these meals must be reduced by degrees to\r\nfour or five, which may be continued until they are full grown. Grain\r\nshould not be given to newly-hatched chickens. The very best food for\r\nthem, after their first meal of bread-crumbs and egg, is made of two\r\nparts of coarse oatmeal and one part of barley-meal, mixed into a thick\r\ncrumbly paste with milk or water. If milk is used, it must be fresh\r\nmixed for each meal, or it will become sour. Cold oatmeal porridge is an\r\nexcellent food, and much liked by them. After the first week they may\r\nhave cheaper food, such as bran, oatmeal, and Indian meal mixed, or\r\npotatoes mashed with bran. In a few days they may also have some whole\r\ngrain, which their little gizzards will then be fully able to grind.\r\nGrits, crushed wheat, or bruised oats, should form the last meal at\r\nnight. Bread sopped in water is the worst food they can have, and even\r\nwith milk is still inferior to meal. For the first three or four days\r\nthey may also have daily the yolk of an egg boiled hard and chopped up\r\nsmall, which will be sufficient for a dozen chicks; and afterwards, a\r\npiece of cooked meat, rather underdone, the size of a good walnut,\r\nminced fine, should be daily given to the brood until they are three\r\nweeks old. In winter and very early spring this stimulating diet may be\r\ngiven regularly, and once a day they should also have some stale bread\r\nsoaked in ale; and whenever chickens suffer from bad feathering, caused\r\neither by the coldness of the season or delicacy of constitution, they\r\nmust be fed highly, and have a daily supply of bread soaked in ale.\r\nAnts' eggs, which are well known as the very best animal diet for young\r\npheasants, are also excellent for young chickens; and when a nest can be\r\nobtained it should be thrown with its surrounding mould into the run for\r\nthem to peck at. Where there is no grass-plot they should have some\r\ngrass cut into small pieces, or other vegetable food minced small, until\r\nthey are able to peck pieces from the large leaves. Onion tops and leeks\r\nchopped small, cress, lettuce, and cabbage, are much relished by all\r\nyoung poultry. The French breeders give a few dried nettle seeds\r\noccasionally. Young growing fowls can scarcely have too much food, so\r\nlong as they eat it with a good appetite, and do not tread any about, or\r\notherwise leave it to waste.\r\n\r\nYoung poultry cannot thrive if overcrowded. They should not be allowed\r\nto roost on the branches of trees or shrubs, or otherwise out of doors,\r\neven in the warmest weather, or they will acquire the habit of sleeping\r\nout, which cannot be easily overcome; not that they would suffer much\r\nfrom even severe weather, when once accustomed to roosting out of doors,\r\nbut from want of warmth the supply of eggs would decrease, and it would,\r\nin many places, be unsafe and, in most, inconvenient.\r\n\r\nThe sooner chickens can be fattened, of course the greater must be the\r\nprofit. They should be put up for fattening as soon as they have quitted\r\nthe hen, for they are then generally in good condition, but begin to\r\nlose flesh as their bones develop and become stronger, particularly\r\nthose fowls which stand high on the leg.\r\n\r\nFowls are in perfection for eating just before they are fully developed.\r\nBy keeping young fowls, especially the cockerels, too long before\r\nfattening them for market or home consumption, they eat up all the\r\nprofit that would be made by disposing of them when the pullets have\r\nceased laying just before their first adult moult, and the cockerels\r\nbefore their appetites have become large. Fowls intended to be fattened\r\nshould be well and abundantly fed from their birth; for if they are\r\nbadly fed during their growth they become stunted, the bones do not\r\nattain their full size, and no amount of feeding will afterwards supply\r\nthese defects and transform them into fine, large birds. Poultry that\r\nhave been constantly fed well from their birth will not only be always\r\nready for the table, with very little extra attention and feeding, but\r\ntheir flesh will be superior in juiciness and rich flavour to those\r\nwhich are fattened up from a poor state. In choosing full-grown fowls\r\nfor fattening, the short-legged and early-hatched should be preferred.\r\n\r\nIn fattening poultry, \"the well-known common methods,\" Mowbray observes,\r\n\"are, first, to give fowls the run of the farmyard, where they thrive\r\nupon the offals of the stables and other refuse, with perhaps some\r\nsmall regular feeds; but at threshing time they become fat, and are\r\nthence styled barn-door fowls, probably the most delicate and\r\nhigh-flavoured of all others, both from their full allowance of the\r\nfinest corn and from the constant health in which they are kept, by\r\nliving in the natural state, and having the full enjoyment of air and\r\nexercise; or secondly, they are confined during a certain number of\r\nweeks in coops; those fowls which are soonest ready being drawn as\r\nwanted.\" \"The former method,\" says Mr. Dickson, \"is immeasurably the\r\nbest as regards the flavour and even wholesomeness of the fowls as food,\r\nand though the latter mode may, in some cases, make the fowls fatter, it\r\nis only when they have been always accustomed to confinement; for when\r\nbarn-door fowls are cooped up for a week or two under the notion of\r\nimproving them for the table, and increasing their fat, it rarely\r\nsucceeds, since the fowls generally pine for their liberty, and,\r\nslighting their food, lose instead of gaining additional flesh.\"\r\n\r\nTo fatten fowls that have not the advantage of a barn-door, Mowbray\r\nrecommends fattening-houses large enough to contain twenty or thirty\r\nfowls, warm and airy, with well-raised earth floors, slightly littered\r\ndown with straw, which should be often changed, and the whole place kept\r\nperfectly clean. \"Sandy gravel,\" he says, \"should be placed in several\r\ndifferent layers, and often changed. A sufficient number of troughs for\r\nboth water and food should be placed around, that the stock may feed\r\nwith as little interruption as possible from each other, and perches in\r\nthe same proportion should be furnished for those birds which are\r\ninclined to perch, which few of them will desire after they have begun\r\nto fatten, but it helps to keep them easy and contented until that\r\nperiod. In this manner fowls may be fattened to the highest pitch, and\r\nyet preserved in a healthy state, their flesh being nearly equal in\r\nquality to the barn-door fowl. To suffer fattening fowls to perch is\r\ncontrary to the general practice, since it is supposed to bend and\r\ndeform the backbone; but as soon as they become heavy and indolent from\r\nfeeding, they will rather incline to roost in the straw, and the\r\nliberty of perching has a tendency to accelerate the period when they\r\nwish for rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe practice of fattening fowls in coops, if carried to a moderate\r\nextent, is not objectionable, and may be necessary in many cases. The\r\ncoop may be three feet high, two feet wide, and four feet long, which\r\nwill accommodate six or eight birds, according to their size; or it may\r\nbe constructed in compartments, each being about nine inches by\r\neighteen, and about eighteen inches high. The floor should not consist\r\nof board, but be formed of bars two inches wide, and placed two inches\r\napart. The bars should be laid from side to side, and not from the back\r\nto the front of the coop. They should be two inches wide at the upper\r\npart, with slanting or rounded sides, so as to prevent the dung from\r\nsticking to them instead of falling straight between. The front should\r\nbe made of rails three inches apart. The house in which the coops are\r\nplaced should be properly ventilated, but free from cold draughts, and\r\nkept of an even temperature, which should be moderately warm. The fronts\r\nof the coops should be covered with matting or other kind of protection\r\nin cold weather. The coop should be placed about two inches from the\r\nground, and a shallow tray filled with fresh dry earth should be placed\r\nunderneath to catch the droppings, and renewed every day.\r\n\r\nWhen fowls are put up to fat they should not have any food given to them\r\nfor some hours, and they will take it then more eagerly than if pressed\r\nupon them when first put into the coop. But little grain should be given\r\nto fowls during the time they are fattening in coops; indeed the chief\r\nsecret of success consists in supplying them with the most fattening\r\nfood without stint, in such a form that their digestive mills shall find\r\nno difficulty in grinding it. Buckwheat-meal is the best food for\r\nfattening; and to its use the French, in a great measure, owe the\r\nsplendid condition of the fowls they send to market. If it cannot be\r\nhad, the best substitute is an equal mixture of maize-meal and\r\nbarley-meal. The meal may be mixed with skim milk if available. Oatmeal\r\nand barley-meal alternately, mixed with milk, and occasionally with a\r\nlittle dripping, is good fattening food. Milk is most excellent for all\r\nyoung poultry. A little chopped green food should be given daily, to\r\nkeep their bowels in a proper state.\r\n\r\nThe feeding-troughs, which must be kept clean by frequent scouring,\r\nshould be placed before the fowls at regular times, and when they have\r\neaten sufficient it is best to remove them, and place a little gravel\r\nwithin reach to assist digestion. Each fowl should have as much food as\r\nit will eat at one time, but none should be left to become sour. A\r\nlittle barley may, however, be scattered within their reach. A good\r\nsupply of clean water must be always within their reach. If a bird\r\nappears to be troubled with vermin, some powdered sulphur, well rubbed\r\ninto the roots of the feathers, will give immediate relief. The coops\r\nshould be thoroughly lime-washed after the fowls are removed, and well\r\ndried before fresh birds are put up in them.\r\n\r\nIt is a common practice to fatten poultry in coops by a process called\r\n\"cramming,\" by which they are loaded with greasy fat in a very short\r\ntime. But it is evident that such overtaxing of the fowls' digestive\r\npowers, want of exercise and fresh air, confinement in a small space,\r\nand partial deprivation of light, without which nothing living, either\r\nanimal or vegetable, can flourish, cannot produce healthy or wholesome\r\nflesh. \"Indeed,\" as Mowbray observes, \"it seems contrary to reason, that\r\nfowls fed upon such greasy, impure mixtures can possibly produce flesh\r\nor fat so firm, delicate, high-flavoured, or nourishing, as those\r\nfattened upon more simple and substantial food; as for example, meal and\r\nmilk, and perhaps either treacle or sugar. With respect to grease of any\r\nkind, its chief effect must be to render the flesh loose and of a coarse\r\nflavour. Neither can any advantage be gained, except perhaps a\r\ncommercial one, by very quick feeding; for real excellence cannot be\r\nobtained but by waiting nature's time, and using the best food. Besides\r\nall this, I have been very unsuccessful in my few attempts to fatten\r\nfowls by cramming; they seem to loathe the crams, to pine, and to lose\r\nthe flesh they were put up with, instead of acquiring flesh; and when\r\ncrammed fowls do succeed, they must necessarily, in the height of their\r\nfat, be in a state of disease.\" Mr. Muirhead, poulterer to Her Majesty\r\nin Scotland, says: \"With regard to _cramming_, I may say that it is\r\n_wholly_ unnecessary, provided the fowls have abundance of the best food\r\nat regular intervals, fresh air, and a free run; in confinement fowls\r\nmay gain fat, but they lose flesh. None but those who have had\r\nexperience can form any idea how both qualities can be obtained in a\r\nnatural way. I have seen fowls reared at Inchmartine (which had never\r\nbeen shut up, or had food forced upon them), equal, if not superior, to\r\nthe finest Surrey fowl, or those fattened by myself for the Royal\r\ntable.\"\r\n\r\nIf \"cramming\" is practised it should be done in the following manner:\r\nThe feeder, usually a female, should take the fowl carefully out of the\r\nfatting-coop by placing both her hands gently under its breast, then sit\r\ndown with the bird upon her lap, its rump under her left arm, open its\r\nmouth with the finger and thumb of the left hand, take the pellet with\r\nthe right, dip it well into water, milk, or pot liquor, shake the\r\nsuperfluous moisture from it, put it into the mouth, \"cram\" it gently\r\ninto the gullet with her forefinger, then close the beak and gently\r\nassist it down into the crop with the forefinger and thumb, without\r\nbreaking the pellet, and taking great care not to pinch the throat. When\r\nthe fowl has been \"crammed\" it should be carefully carried back to its\r\ncoop, both hands being placed under its breast as before. Chickens\r\nshould be \"crammed\" regularly every twelve hours. The \"cramming\" should\r\ncommence with a few pellets, and the number be gradually increased at\r\neach meal until it amounts to about fifteen. But always before you begin\r\nto feed gently feel the fowl's crop to ascertain that the preceding meal\r\nhas been digested, and if you find it to contain food, let the bird wait\r\nuntil it is all digested, and give it fewer pellets at the next meal. If\r\nthe \"crams\" should become hardened in the crop, some lukewarm water must\r\nbe given to the bird, or poured down its throat if disinclined to\r\ndrink, and the crop be gently pressed with the fingers until the\r\nhardened mass has become loosened so that the gizzard can grind it.\r\n\r\nThe food chiefly used in France for \"cramming\" fowls is buckwheat-meal\r\nbolted very fine and mixed with milk. It should be prepared in the\r\nfollowing manner: Pour the milk, which should be lukewarm in winter,\r\ninto a hole made in the heap of meal, mixing it up with a wooden spoon a\r\nlittle at a time as long as the meal will take up the milk, and make it\r\ninto the consistency of dough, keep kneading it until it will not stick\r\nto the hands, then divide it into pieces twice as large as an egg, which\r\nform into rolls generally about as thick as a small finger, but more or\r\nless thick according to the size of the fowls to be fed, and divide the\r\nrolls into pellets about two and a half inches in length by a slanting\r\ncut, which leaves pointed ends, that are easier to \"cram\" the fowls with\r\nthan if they were square. The pellets should be rolled up as dry as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe operation of caponising as performed in England is barbarous,\r\nextremely painful, and dangerous. In France it is performed in a much\r\nmore scientific and skilful manner. But the small advantage gained by\r\nthis unnatural operation is more than counterbalanced by the unnecessary\r\npain inflicted on the bird, and the great risk of losing it. Capons\r\nnever moult, and lose their previously strong, shrill voice. In warm,\r\ndry countries they grow to a large size, and soon fatten, but do not\r\nsucceed well in our moist, cold climate. They are not common in this\r\ncountry, and most of the fowls sold in the London markets as capons are\r\nmerely young cockerels well crammed. If capons are kept they should have\r\na separate house, for the other fowls will not allow those even of their\r\nown family to occupy the same roosting-perch with them. The hens not\r\nonly show them indifference, but decided aversion. Hen chickens,\r\ndeprived of their reproductive organs in order to fatten them sooner,\r\nare common in France, where they are styled poulardes.\r\n\r\nFattening ought to be completed in from ten to twenty days. When fowls\r\nare once fattened up they should be killed, for they cannot be kept fat,\r\nbut begin to lose flesh and become feverish, which renders their flesh\r\nred and unsaleable, and frequently causes their death.\r\n\r\nGreat cruelty is often ignorantly inflicted by poulterers, higglers, and\r\nothers, in \"twisting the necks\" of poultry. An easy mode of killing a\r\nfowl is to give the bird a very sharp blow with a small but heavy blunt\r\nstick, such as a child's bat or wooden sword, at the back of the neck,\r\nabout the second or third joint from the head, which will, if properly\r\ndone, sever the spine and cause death very speedily. But the knife is\r\nthe most merciful means; the bird being first hung up by the legs, the\r\nmouth must be opened wide, and a long, narrow, sharp-pointed knife, like\r\na long penknife, which instrument is made for the purpose, should be\r\nthrust firmly through the back part of the roof of the mouth up into the\r\nbrain, which will cause almost instant death. Another mode of killing is\r\nto pluck a few feathers from the side of the head, just below the ear,\r\nand make a deep incision there. Some say that fowls should not be bled\r\nto death like turkeys and geese, as, from the loss of blood, the flesh\r\nbecomes dry and insipid. But when great whiteness of flesh is desired,\r\nthe fowl should be hung up by its legs immediately after being killed,\r\nand if it has been killed without the flow of blood, an incision should\r\nbe made in the neck so that it may bleed freely.\r\n\r\nFowls that have been kept without food and water for twelve hours before\r\nbeing killed will keep much better than if they had been recently fed,\r\nas the food is apt to ferment in the crop and bowels, which often causes\r\nthe fowl to turn green in a few hours in warm weather. If empty they\r\nshould not be drawn, and they will keep much better. Fowls are easiest\r\nplucked at once, while warm; they should afterwards be scalded by\r\ndipping them for a moment in boiling water, which will give a plump\r\nappearance to any good fowl. Fowls should not be packed for market\r\nbefore they are quite cold. Old fowls should not be roasted, but boiled,\r\nand they will then prove tolerably good eating.\r\n\r\nThe feathers are valuable and should be preserved, which is very easily\r\nmanaged. \"Strip the plumage,\" says Mr. Wright, \"from the quills of the\r\nlarger feathers, and mix with the small ones, putting the whole loosely\r\nin paper bags, which should be hung up in the kitchen, or some other\r\nwarm place, for a few days to dry. Then let the bags be baked three or\r\nfour times for half an hour each time, in a cool oven, drying for two\r\ndays between each baking, and the process will be completed. Less\r\ntrouble than this will do, and is often made to suffice; but the\r\nfeathers are inferior in crispness to those so treated, and may\r\noccasionally become offensive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSTOCK, BREEDING, AND CROSSING.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep only good, healthy, vigorous, well-bred fowls, whether you keep\r\nthem to produce eggs or chickens, or both. The ill-bred mongrel fowls\r\nwhich are so commonly kept, are the most voracious, and consume larger\r\nquantities of food, without turning it to any account; while well-bred\r\nfowls eat less, and quickly convert that into fat, flesh, and eggs.\r\n\"Large, well-bred fowls,\" says Mr. Edwards, \"do not consume more food\r\nthan ravenous, mongrel breeds. It is the same with fowls as with other\r\nstock. I have at this moment two store pigs, one highly bred, the other\r\na rough, ill-bred animal. They have, since they left their mothers, been\r\nfed together and upon the same food. The former, I am confident (from\r\nobservation), ate considerably less than the latter, which was\r\nparticularly ravenous. The former pig, however, is in excellent\r\ncondition, kind, and in a measure fat; whereas the latter looks hard,\r\nstarved, and thin, and I am sure she will require one-third more food to\r\nmake bacon of.\"\r\n\r\nFor the amateur who is content with eggs and chickens, and does not long\r\nfor prize cups, excellent birds possessing nearly all the best\r\ncharacteristics of their breeds, but rendered imperfect by a few\r\nblemishes, may be purchased at a small cost, and will be as good layers\r\nor chicken-producers, and answer his purpose as well as the most\r\nexpensive that can be bought.\r\n\r\nThe choice of breed must depend upon the object for which the fowls are\r\nkept, whether chiefly for eggs or to produce chickens, or for both; the\r\nclimate, soil, and situation; the space that can be allotted to them;\r\nand the amount of attention that can be devoted to their care. If fowls\r\nare to be bred for exhibition, you must be guided by your own taste,\r\npocket, and resources, as well as by the suitability of the situation\r\nfor the particular breed desired. The advantages, disadvantages, and\r\npeculiarities of the various breeds will be described under their\r\nrespective heads.\r\n\r\nIn commencing poultry-keeping buy only young and healthy birds. No one\r\nsign is infallible to the inexperienced. In general, however, the legs\r\nof a young hen look delicate and smooth, her comb and wattles are soft\r\nand fresh, and her general outline, even in good condition (unless when\r\nfattened for the table), rather light and graceful; whilst an old one\r\nwill have rather hard, horny-looking shanks; her comb and wattles look\r\nsomewhat harder, drier, and more \"scurfy,\" and her figure is well filled\r\nout. But any of these signs may be deceptive, and the beginner should\r\nuse his own powers of observation, and try and catch the \"old look,\"\r\nwhich he will soon learn to know.\r\n\r\nAll authorities agree that a cock is in his prime at two years of age,\r\nthough some birds show every sign of full vigour when only four months\r\nold. It is agreed by nearly all the greatest authorities that the ages\r\nof the cocks and hens should be different; however, good birds may be\r\nbred from parents of the same age, but they should not be less than a\r\nyear old. The strongest chickens are obtained from two-year old hens by\r\na cockerel of about a year old; but such broods contain a disproportion\r\nof cocks, and, therefore, most poultry-keepers prefer to breed from\r\nwell-grown pullets of not less than nine months with a cock of two years\r\nof age. The cock should not be related to the hens. It is, therefore,\r\nnot advisable to purchase him from the same breeder of whom you procure\r\nthe hens. Do not let him be the parent of chickens from pullets that are\r\nhis own offspring. Breeding in-and-in causes degeneracy in fowls as in\r\nall other animals. Some birds retain all their fire and energy until\r\nfive or even six years of age, but they are beyond their prime after the\r\nthird, or at the latest their fourth year; and should be replaced by\r\nyounger birds of the same breed, but from a different stock.\r\n\r\nPoultry-breeders differ with respect to the proper number of hens that\r\nshould be allowed to one cock. Columella, who wrote upon poultry about\r\ntwo thousand years ago, advised twelve hens to one cock, but stated that\r\n\"our ancestors did use to give but five hens.\" Stephanus gave the same\r\nnumber as Columella. Bradley, and the authors of the \"Complete Farmer,\"\r\nand the article upon the subject in \"Rees's Cyclopaedia,\" give seven or\r\neight; and those who breed game-cocks are particular in limiting the\r\nnumber of hens to four or five for one cock, in order to obtain strong\r\nchickens. If fine, strong chickens be desired for fattening or breeding,\r\nthere should not be more than five or six hens to one cock; but if the\r\nsupply of eggs is the chief consideration, ten or twelve may be allowed;\r\nindeed, if eggs are the sole object, he can be dispensed with\r\naltogether, and his food saved, as hens lay, if there be any difference,\r\nrather better without one.\r\n\r\nThe russet red is the most hardy colour, white the most delicate, and\r\nblack the most prolific. General directions for the choice of fowls, as\r\nto size, shape, and colour, cannot be applicable to all breeds, which\r\nmust necessarily vary upon these points. But in all breeds the cock\r\nshould, as M. Parmentier says, \"carry his head high, have a quick,\r\nanimated look, a strong, shrill voice (except in the Cochins, which have\r\na fuller tone), a fine red comb, shining as if varnished, large wattles\r\nof the same colour, strong wings, muscular thighs, thick legs furnished\r\nwith strong spurs, the claws rather bent and sharply pointed. He ought\r\nalso to be free in his motions, to crow frequently, and to scratch the\r\nground often in search of worms, not so much for himself, as to treat\r\nhis hens. He ought, withal, to be brisk, spirited, ardent, and ready in\r\ncaressing the hens, quick in defending them, attentive in soliciting\r\nthem to eat, in keeping them together, and in assembling them at night.\"\r\n\r\nTo prevent cocks from fighting, old Mascall, following Columella, says:\r\n\"Now, to slacke that heate of jealousie, ye shall slitte two pieces of\r\nthicke leather, and put them on his legges, and those will hang over his\r\nfeete, which will correct the vehement heate of jealousie within him\";\r\nand M. Parmentier observes that \"such a bit of leather will cause the\r\nmost turbulent cock to become as quiet as a man who is fettered at the\r\nfeet, hands, and neck.\"\r\n\r\nThe hen should be of good constitution and temper, and, if required to\r\nsit, large in the body and wide in the wings, so as to cover many eggs\r\nand shelter many chickens, but short in the legs, or she could not sit\r\nwell. M. Parmentier advises the rejection of savage, quarrelsome, or\r\npeevish hens, as such are seldom favourites with the cocks, scarcely\r\never lay, and do not hatch well; also all above four or five years of\r\nage, those that are too fat to lay, and those whose combs and claws are\r\nrough, which are signs that they have ceased to lay. Hens should not be\r\nkept over their third year unless very good or choice. Hens are not\r\nuncommon with the plumage and spurs of the cock, and which imitate,\r\nthough badly, his full-toned crow. In such fowls the power of producing\r\neggs is invariably lost from internal disease, as has been fully\r\ndemonstrated by Mr. Yarrell in the \"Philosophical Transactions\" for\r\n1827, and in the \"Proceedings of the Zoological Society\" for 1831. Such\r\nbirds should be fattened and killed as soon as observed.\r\n\r\nBy careful study of the characteristics of the various breeds, breeding\r\nfrom select specimens, and judicious crossing, great size may be\r\nattained, maturity early developed, facility in putting on flesh\r\nencouraged, hardiness of constitution and strength gained, and the\r\ninclination to sit or the faculty of laying increased.\r\n\r\nSir John Sebright, speaking of breeding cattle, says: \"Animals may be\r\nsaid to be improved when any desired quality has been increased by art\r\nbeyond what that quality was in the same breed in a state of nature. The\r\nswiftness of the racehorse, the propensity to fatten in cattle, and to\r\nproduce fine wool in sheep, are improvements which have been made in\r\nparticular varieties in the species to which these animals belong. What\r\nhas been produced by art must be continued by the same means, for the\r\nmost improved breeds will soon return to a state of nature, or perhaps\r\ndefects will arise which did not exist when the breed was in its natural\r\nstate, unless the greatest attention is paid to the selection of the\r\nindividuals who are to breed together.\"\r\n\r\nThe exact origin of the common domestic fowl and its numerous varieties\r\nis unknown. It is doubtless derived from one or more of the wild or\r\njungle fowls of India. Some naturalists are of opinion that it is\r\nderived from the common jungle fowl known as the _Gallus Bankiva_ of\r\nTemminck, or _Gallus Ferrugineus_ of Gmelin, which very closely\r\nresembles the variety known as Black-breasted Red Game, except that the\r\ntail of the cock is more depressed; while others consider it to have\r\nbeen produced by the crossing of that species with one or more others,\r\nas the Malay gigantic fowl, known as the _Gallus giganteus_ of Temminck,\r\nSonnerat's Jungle Fowl, _Gallus sonneratii_, and probably some other\r\nspecies. At what period or by what people it was reclaimed is not known,\r\nbut it was probably first domesticated in India. The writers of\r\nantiquity speak of it as a bird long domesticated and widely spread in\r\ntheir days. Very likely there are many species unknown to us in Sumatra,\r\nJava, and the rich woods of Borneo.\r\n\r\nThe process by which the various breeds have been produced \"is simple\r\nand easily understood,\" says Mr. Wright. \"Even in the wild state the\r\noriginal breed will show some amount of variation in colour, form, and\r\nsize; whilst in domestication the tendency to change, as every one\r\nknows, is very much increased. By breeding from birds which show any\r\nmarked feature, stock is obtained of which a portion will possess that\r\nfeature in an _increased degree_; and by again selecting the best\r\nspecimens, the special points sought may be developed to almost any\r\ndegree required. A good example of such a process of development may be\r\nseen in the 'white face' so conspicuous in the Spanish breed. White ears\r\nwill be observed occasionally in all fowls; even in such breeds as\r\nCochins or Brahmas, where white ear-lobes are considered almost fatal\r\nblemishes; they continually occur, and by selecting only white-eared\r\nspecimens to breed from, they might be speedily fixed in any variety as\r\none of the characteristics. A large pendent white ear-lobe once firmly\r\nestablished, traces of the white _face_ will now and then be found, and\r\nby a similar method is capable of development and fixture; whilst any\r\ncolour of plumage or of leg may be obtained and established in the same\r\nway. The original amount of character required is _very_ slight; a\r\nsingle hen-tailed cock will be enough to give that characteristic to a\r\nwhole breed. Any peculiarity of _constitution_, such as constant laying,\r\nor frequent incubation, may be developed and perpetuated in a similar\r\nmanner, all that is necessary being care and time. That such has been\r\nthe method employed in the formation of the more distinct races of our\r\npoultry, is proved by the fact that a continuance of the same careful\r\nselection is needful to perpetuate them in perfection. If the very best\r\nexamples of a breed are selected as the starting-point, and the produce\r\nis bred from indiscriminately for many generations, the distinctive\r\npoints, whatever they are, rapidly decline, and there is also a more or\r\nless gradual but sure return to the primitive wild type, in size and\r\neven colour of the plumage. The purest black or white originally,\r\nrapidly becomes first marked with, and ultimately changed into, the\r\noriginal red or brown, whilst the other features simultaneously\r\ndisappear. If, however, the process of artificial selection be carried\r\ntoo far, and with reference _only to one_ prominent point, any breed is\r\nalmost sure to suffer in the other qualities which have been neglected,\r\nand this has been the case with the very breed already mentioned--the\r\nwhite-faced Spanish. We know from old fanciers that this breed was\r\nformerly considered hardy, and even in winter rarely failed to afford a\r\nconstant supply of its unequalled large white eggs. But of late years\r\nattention has been so _exclusively_ directed to the 'white-face,' that\r\nwhilst this feature has been developed and perfected to a degree never\r\nbefore known, the breed has become one of the most delicate of all, and\r\nthe laying qualities of at least many strains have greatly fallen off.\r\nIt would be difficult to avoid such evil results if it were not for a\r\nvaluable compensating principle, which admits of _crossing_. That\r\nprinciple is, that any desired point possessed in perfection by a\r\nforeign breed, may be introduced by crossing into a strain it is desired\r\nto improve, and every other characteristic of the cross be, by\r\nselection, afterwards bred out again. Or one or more of these additional\r\ncharacteristics may be also retained, and thus a _new variety_ be\r\nestablished, as many have been within the last few years.\"\r\n\r\nSize may be imparted to the Dorking by crossing it with the Cochin, and\r\nthe disposition to feather on the legs bred out again by judicious\r\nselection; and the constitution may be strengthened by crossing with the\r\nGame breed. Game fowls that have deteriorated in size, strength, and\r\nfierceness, by a long course of breeding in-and-in, may have all these\r\nqualities restored by crossing with the fierce, powerful, and gigantic\r\nMalay, and his peculiarities may be afterwards bred out. The size of the\r\neggs of the Hamburg might very probably be increased without decreasing,\r\nor with very slightly decreasing, the number of eggs, by crossing with a\r\nHoudan cock; and the size would also be increased for the table. The\r\nFrench breeds, Creve-Coeur, Houdan, and La Fleche, gain in size and\r\nhardiness by being crossed with the Brahma cock. The cross between a\r\nHoudan cock and a Brahma hen \"produces,\" says the \"Henwife,\" \"the finest\r\npossible chickens for market, but not to breed from. Pure Brahmas and\r\nHoudans alone must be kept for that purpose; I have always found the\r\nsecond cross worthless.\"\r\n\r\nIn crossing, the cockerels will more or less resemble the male, and the\r\npullets the hen. \"Long experience,\" says Mr. Wright, \"has ascertained\r\nthat the male bird has most influence upon the colour of the progeny,\r\nand also upon the comb, and what may be called the 'fancy points,' of\r\nany breed generally; whilst the form, size, and useful qualities are\r\nprincipally derived from the hen.\"\r\n\r\nBreed only from the strongest and healthiest fowls. In the breeding of\r\npoultry it is a rule, as in all other cases of organised life, that the\r\nbest-shaped be used for the purpose of propagation. If a cock and hen\r\nhave both the same defect, however trifling it may be, they should never\r\nbe allowed to breed together, for the object is to improve the breed,\r\nnot to deteriorate it, even in the slightest degree. Hens should never\r\nbe allowed to associate with a cock of a different breed if you wish to\r\nkeep the breed pure, and if you desire superior birds, not even with an\r\ninferior male of their own variety. \"No time,\" says Mr. Baily, \"has ever\r\nbeen fixed as necessary to elapse before hens that have been running\r\nwith cocks of divers breeds, and afterwards been placed with their\r\nlegitimate partners, can be depended upon to produce purely-bred\r\nchickens; I am disposed to think at least two months. Time of year may\r\nhave much to do with it. In the winter the escape of a hen from one run\r\nto the other, or the intrusion of a cock, is of little moment; but it\r\nmay be serious in the spring, and destroy the hopes of a season.\" Many\r\npoultry-keepers separate the cocks and hens after the breeding season,\r\nconsidering that stronger chickens will be thereby obtained the next\r\nseason. Where there is a separate house and run for the sitting hen this\r\ncan be conveniently done when that compartment is vacant. In order to\r\npreserve a breed perfectly pure, it will be necessary, where there is\r\nnot a large stock of the race, to breed from birds sprung from the same\r\nparents, but the blood should be crossed every year by procuring one or\r\nmore fowls of the same breed from a distance, or by the exchange of eggs\r\nwith some neighbouring stock, of colour and qualities as nearly allied\r\nas possible with the original breed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPOULTRY SHOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few years ago poultry shows were unknown. In 1846, the first was held\r\nin the Gardens of the Zoological Society, in the Regent's Park; Mr.\r\nBaily being the sole judge. It was a very fair beginning, but did not\r\nsucceed, and it was not till the Cochin-China breed was introduced into\r\nthis country, and the first Birmingham show was held, that these\r\nexhibitions became successful.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, \"the first poultry show that was ever held in 'the good old\r\ntown of Birmingham,' was beset with all the untried difficulties of such\r\na scheme, when without the experiences of the present day, then\r\naltogether unavailable, a few spirited individuals carried to a\r\nsuccessful issue an event that has now proved the foster-parent of the\r\nmany others of similar character that abound in almost every principal\r\ntown of the United Kingdom. It is quite essential, that I may be clearly\r\nunderstood, to preface my narrative by assuring fanciers that in those\r\nformer days poultry amateurs were by no means as general as at the\r\npresent time; few and far between were their locations; and though even\r\nthen, among the few who felt interest in fowls, emulation existed,\r\ngenerally speaking, the keeping of poultry was regarded as 'a useless\r\nhobby,' 'a mere individual caprice,' 'an idle whim from which no good\r\nresult could by possibility accrue'; nay, sometimes it was hinted, 'What\r\na pity they have not something better to employ them during leisure\r\nhours!' and they were styled 'enthusiasts.' But have not the records of\r\nevery age proved that enthusiasts are invariably the pioneers of\r\nimprovement? And time, too, substantiated the verity of this rule in\r\nreference to our subject; for, among other proofs, it brought\r\nincontestable evidence that the raising of poultry was by no means the\r\nunremunerative folly idlers supposed it to be, and hesitated not rashly\r\nto declaim it; likewise, that it simply required to be fairly brought\r\nunder public notice, to prove its general utility, and to induce the\r\nacknowledgment of how strangely so important a source of emolument had\r\nbeen hitherto neglected and overlooked.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Birmingham Show of 1852, about five thousand fowls were\r\nexhibited, and the specimens sold during the four days of the show\r\namounted to nearly two thousand pounds, notwithstanding the high prices\r\naffixed to the pens, and that many were placed at enormous prices\r\namounting to a prohibition, the owners not wishing to sell them. The\r\nBirmingham shows now generally comprise from one to two thousand pens of\r\nfowls and water-fowls, arranged in nearly one hundred classes; besides\r\nan equal proportion of pigeons. This show is the finest and most\r\nimportant, but there are many others of very high character and great\r\nextent. Poultry is also now exhibited to a considerable extent at\r\nagricultural meetings.\r\n\r\nAny one may see the wonderful improvement that has been made in\r\npoultry-breeding by visiting the next Birmingham or other first-class\r\nshow, and comparing the fowls there exhibited with those of his earliest\r\nrecollections, and with those mongrels and impure breeds which may still\r\nbe seen in too many farmyards. Points that were said to be impossible of\r\nattainment have been obtained with comparative ease by perserverance and\r\nskill, and the worst birds of a show are now often superior to the chief\r\nprize fowls of former days. Indeed, \"a modern prize bird,\" says the\r\n\"Henwife,\" \"almost merits the character which a Parisian waiter gave of\r\na melon, when asked to pronounce whether it was a fruit or a vegetable,\r\n'Gentlemen,' said he, 'a melon is neither; it is a work of art.'\"\r\n\r\nSuch shows must have great influence on the improvement of the breeds\r\nand the general management of poultry, though like all other prize\r\nexhibitions they have certain disadvantages. \"We cannot but think,\" says\r\nMr. Wright, \"that our poultry shows have, to some extent, by the\r\ncharacter of the judging, hindered the improvement of many breeds. It\r\nwill be readily admitted in _theory_ that a breed of fowls becomes more\r\nand more valuable as its capacity of producing eggs is increased, and\r\nthe quantity and quality of its flesh are improved, with a small amount\r\nof bone and offal in proportion. But, if we except the Dorking, which\r\ncertainly is judged to some extent as a table fowl, all this is\r\n_totally_ lost sight of both by breeders and judges, and attention is\r\nfixed exclusively upon colour, comb, face, and other equally fancy\r\n'points.' Beauty and utility might be _both_ secured. The French have\r\ntaught us a lesson of some value in this respect. Within a comparatively\r\nrecent period they have produced, by crossing and selection, four new\r\nvarieties, which, although inferior in some points to others of older\r\nstanding, are all eminently valuable as table fowls; and which in one\r\nparticular are superior to any English variety, not even excepting the\r\nDorking--we mean the very small proportion of bone and offal. This is\r\nreally useful and scientific breeding, brought to bear upon _one_\r\ndefinite object, and we do trust the result will prove suggestive with\r\nregard to others equally valuable. We should be afraid to say how much\r\nmight be done if English breeders would bring _their_ perseverance and\r\nexperience to bear in a similar direction. Agricultural Societies in\r\nparticular might be expected in _their_ exhibitions to show some\r\ninterest in the improvement of poultry regarded as _useful stock_, and\r\nto them especially we commend the matter.\"\r\n\r\nThe rules and regulations relating to exhibitions vary at different\r\nshows, and may be obtained by applying to the secretary. Notices of\r\nexhibitions are advertised in the local papers, and in the _Field_ and\r\nother London papers of an agricultural character.\r\n\r\nIn breeding birds for exhibition the number of hens to one cock should\r\nnot exceed four or five, but if only two or three hens of the breed are\r\npossessed, the proper number of his harem should be made up by the\r\naddition of hens of another breed, those being chosen whose eggs are\r\neasily known from the others.\r\n\r\nIf it is intended to rear the chickens for exhibition at the June,\r\nJuly, or August shows, the earlier they are hatched the better, and\r\ntherefore a sitting should be made in January, if you have a young,\r\nhealthy hen broody. Set her on the ground in a warm, sheltered, and\r\nquiet place, perfectly secure from rain, or from any flow of snow water.\r\nFeed her well, and keep water and small quantities of food constantly\r\nwithin her reach, so that she may not be tempted to leave the nest in\r\nsearch of food; for the eggs soon chill in winter. Mix the best oatmeal\r\nwith hot water, and give it to her warm twice a day. A few grains of\r\nhempseed as a stimulant may be given in the middle of the day. The great\r\ndifficulty to overcome in rearing early chickens is to sustain their\r\nvital powers during the very long winter nights, when they are for so\r\nmany hours without food, the only substitute for which is warmth, and\r\nthis can only be well got from the hen. Consequently a young\r\nCochin-China with plenty of \"fluff\" will provide most warmth. The hen\r\nshould not be set on more than five, or at most seven eggs; for if she\r\nhas more, although she may sufficiently cover the chickens while very\r\nsmall, she will not be able to do so when they grow larger, and the\r\nouter ones will be chilled unless they manage to push themselves into\r\nthe inside places, and then the displaced chickens being warm are sure\r\nto get more chilled than the others; and so the greater number of the\r\nbrood, even if they survive, will probably be weakly, puny things,\r\nthrough the greedy desire to rear so many, while if she hatch but five\r\nchickens she will probably rear four. The hen should be cooped until the\r\nchickens are at least ten weeks old, and covered up at night with\r\nmatting, sacking, or a piece of carpet.\r\n\r\nGive them plenty of curd, chopped egg, and oatmeal, mixed with new milk.\r\nStiff oatmeal porridge is the best stock food. Some onion tops minced\r\nfine will be an excellent addition if they can be had. They should have\r\nsome milk to drink. Feed the hen well. The best warmth the chickens can\r\nhave is that of their mother, and the best warmth for her is generated\r\nby generous, but proper, food, and a good supply of it. Early chickens\r\nrearing for show should be fed twice after dark, say at eight and\r\neleven o'clock, and again at seven in the morning, so that they will not\r\nbe without food for more than eight hours. The hen should be fed at the\r\nsame times, and she will become accustomed to it, and call the chickens\r\nto feed; it will also generate more warmth in her for their benefit.\r\nYolk of egg beaten up and given to drink is most strengthening for\r\nweakly chickens; or it may be mixed with their oatmeal. The tender\r\nbreeds should not be hatched till April or May, unless in a mild\r\nclimate, or with exceptional advantages.\r\n\r\nFor winter exhibition, March and April hatched birds are preferable to\r\nthose hatched earlier. Not more than seven eggs should be set, for a hen\r\ncannot scratch up insects and worms and find peculiar herbage for more\r\nthan six chickens. If the chickens have not a good grass run, they must\r\nbe supplied with abundance of green food.\r\n\r\nThey should not be allowed to roost before they are three months old,\r\nand the perches must be sufficiently large. Mr. Wright recommends a bed\r\nof clean, dry ashes, an inch deep, for those that leave the hen before\r\nthe proper age for roosting, and does not allow his chickens, even while\r\nwith the hen, to bed upon straw, considering the ashes to be much\r\ncleaner and also warmer.\r\n\r\nThe chickens intended to be exhibited should be distinguished from their\r\ncompanions by small stripes of different coloured silks loosely sewn\r\nround their legs, which distinguishing colours should be entered in the\r\npoultry-book. A few good birds should always be kept in reserve to fill\r\nup the pen in case of accidents.\r\n\r\nWeight is more important in the December and later winter shows than at\r\nthose held between August and November, but at all shows feather and\r\nother points of competitors being equal weight must carry the day, Game\r\nand Bantams excepted. It is not safe to trust to the apparent weight of\r\na bird, for the feathers deceive, and it is therefore advisable to weigh\r\nthe birds occasionally. Each should be weighed in a basket, allowance\r\nbeing made for the weight of the basket, and they should if possible be\r\nweighed before a meal. But fowls that are over-fattened, as some judges\r\nvery improperly desire, cannot be in good health anymore than \"crammed\"\r\nfowls, and are useless for breeding, producing at best a few puny,\r\ndelicate, or sickly chickens; thus making the exhibition a mere \"show,\"\r\nbarren of all useful results.\r\n\r\nPullets continue to grow until they begin to lay, which almost or quite\r\nstops their growth; and therefore if great size is desired for\r\nexhibition, they should be kept from the cockerels and partly from\r\nstimulating food until a month before the show, when they will be\r\nrequired to be matched in pens. During this month they should have extra\r\nfood and attention.\r\n\r\nIf fowls intended for exhibition are allowed to sit, the chickens are\r\napt to cause injury to their plumage, and loss of condition, while if\r\nprevented from sitting, they are liable to suffer in moulting. Their\r\nchickens may be given to other hens, but the best and safest plan is to\r\nset a broody exhibition hen on duck's eggs, which will satisfy her\r\nnatural desire for sitting, while the young ducklings will give her much\r\nless trouble, and leave her sooner than a brood of her own kind.\r\n\r\nAll the birds in a pen should match in comb, colour of their legs, and\r\nindeed in every particular. Mr. Baily mentions \"a common fault in\r\nexhibitors who send two pens composed of three excellent and three\r\ninferior birds, so divided as to form perhaps one third class and one\r\nhighly commended pen: whereas a different selection would make one of\r\nunusual merit. If an amateur who wishes to exhibit has fifteen fowls to\r\nchoose from, and to form a pen of a cock and two hens, he should study\r\nand scan them closely while feeding at his feet in the morning. He\r\nshould then have a place similar to an exhibition pen, wherein he can\r\nput the selected birds; they should be raised to the height at which he\r\ncan best see them, and before he has looked long at them defects will\r\nbecome apparent one after the other till, in all probability, neither of\r\nthe subjects of his first selection will go to the show. We also advise\r\nhim rather to look for defects than to dwell on beauties--the latter\r\nare always prominent enough. The pen of which we speak should be a\r\nmoveable one for convenience' sake, and it is well to leave the fowls in\r\nit for a time that they may become accustomed to each other, and also to\r\nan exhibition pen.\" Birds that are strangers should never be put into\r\nthe same hamper, for not only the cocks but even the hens will fight\r\nwith and disfigure each other.\r\n\r\nSome give linseed for a few days before the exhibition to impart lustre\r\nto the plumage, by increasing the secretion of oil. A small quantity of\r\nthe meal should be mixed with their usual soft food, as fowls generally\r\nrefuse the whole grain. But buckwheat and hempseed, mixed in equal\r\nproportions, if given for the evening meal during the last ten or twelve\r\ndays, is healthier for the bird, much liked, and will not only impart\r\nequal lustre to the plumage, but also improve the appearance of the comb\r\nand wattles.\r\n\r\nSpanish fowls should be kept in confinement for some days before the\r\nshow, with just enough light to enable them to feed and perch, and the\r\nplace should be littered with clean straw. This greatly improves their\r\ncondition; why we know not, but it is an established fact. Game fowls\r\nshould be kept in for a few days, and fed on meal, barley, and bread,\r\nwith a few peas, which tend to make the plumage hard, but will make them\r\ntoo fat if given freely. Dark and golden birds should be allowed to run\r\nabout till they have to be sent off. Remove all scurf or dead skin from\r\nthe comb, dry dirt from the beak, and stains from the plumage, and wash\r\ntheir legs clean. White and light fowls that have a good grass run and\r\nplenty of clean straw in their houses and yards to scratch in, will\r\nseldom require washing, but town birds, and country ones if not\r\nperfectly clean, should be washed the day before the show with tepid\r\nwater and mild white soap rubbed on flannel, care being taken to wash\r\nthe feathers downwards, so as not to break or ruffle them; afterwards\r\nwiped with a piece of flannel that has been thoroughly soaked in clean\r\nwater, and gently dried with soft towels before the fire; or the bird\r\nmay be entirely dipped into a pan of warm water, then rinsed thoroughly\r\nin cold water, wiped with a flannel, and placed in a basket with soft\r\nstraw before a fire to dry. They should then be shut up in their houses\r\nwith plenty of clean straw. They should have their feet washed if dirty,\r\nand be well fed with soft nourishing food just before being put into the\r\ntravelling-basket, for hard food is apt to cause fever and heat while\r\ntravelling, and, having to be digested without gravel or exercise,\r\ncauses indigestion, which ruffles the plumage, dulls its colour, darkens\r\nthe comb, and altogether spoils the appearance of the bird. Sopped or\r\nsteeped bread is excellent.\r\n\r\nThe hampers should always be round or oval in form, as fowls invariably\r\ncreep into corners and destroy their plumage. They should be high enough\r\nfor the cocks to stand upright in, without touching the top with their\r\ncombs. Some exhibitors prefer canvas tops to wicker lids, considering\r\nthat the former preserve the fowls' combs from injury if they should\r\nstrike against the top, while others prefer the latter as being more\r\nsecure, and allowing one hamper to be placed upon another if necessary,\r\nand also preserving the fowls from injury if a heavy hamper or package\r\nshould otherwise be placed over it. A good plan is to have a double\r\ncanvas top, the space between being filled with hay. A thick layer of\r\nhay or straw should be placed at the bottom of the basket. Wheaten straw\r\nis the best in summer and early autumn, and oat or barley straw later in\r\nthe year and during winter. A good lining also is essential; coarse\r\ncalico stitched round the inside of the basket is the best. Ducks and\r\ngeese do not require their hampers to be lined, except in very cold\r\nweather; and the best lining for them is made by stitching layers of\r\npulled straw round the inside of the basket. Turkeys should have their\r\nhampers lined, for although they are very hardy, cold and wet damage\r\ntheir appearance more than other poultry. Take care that the geese\r\ncannot get at the label, for they will eat it, and also devour the\r\nhempen fastenings if within their reach.\r\n\r\nBe very careful in entering your birds for exhibition; describe their\r\nages, breed, &c., exactly and accurately, and see yourself to the\r\npacking and labelling of their hampers.\r\n\r\nMr. F. Wragg, the superintendent of the poultry-yard of R. W. Boyle,\r\nEsq., whose fowls have a sea voyage from Ireland besides the railway\r\njourney, and yet always appear in splendid condition and \"bloom,\" ties\r\non one side of the hamper, \"near the top, a fresh-pulled cabbage, and on\r\nthe other side a good piece of the bottom side of a loaf, of which they\r\nwill eat away all the soft part. Before starting, I give each bird half\r\na tablespoonful of port wine, which makes them sleep a good part of the\r\njourney. Of course, if I go with my birds, as I generally do, I see that\r\nthey, as well as myself, have 'refreshment' on the road.\"[A] The cabbage\r\nwill always be a treat, and the loaf and wine may be added for long\r\njourneys.\r\n\r\nBirds are frequently over-fed at the show, particularly with barley,\r\nwhich cannot be properly digested for want of gravel and exercise; and\r\ntherefore, if upon their return their crops are hard and combs look\r\ndark, give a tablespoonful of castor oil; but if they look well do not\r\ninterfere with them. They should not have any grain, but be fed\r\nsparingly on stale bread soaked in warm ale, with two or three mouthfuls\r\nof tepid water, for liquid is most hurtful if given in quantity. They\r\nshould not be put into the yard with the other fowls which may treat\r\nthem, after their absence, as intruders, but be joined with them at\r\nnight when the others have gone to roost. On the next day give them a\r\nmoderate allowance of soft food with a moderate supply of water, or\r\nstale bread sopped in water, and a sod of grass or half a cabbage leaf\r\neach, but no other green food; and on the following day they may have\r\ntheir usual food.\r\n\r\nWhen the fowls are brought back, take out the linings, wash them, and\r\nput them by to be ready for the next show; and after the exhibition\r\nseason, on a fine dry day, wash the hampers, dry them thoroughly, and\r\nput them in a dry place. Never use them as quiet berths for sick birds,\r\nwhich are sure to infect them and cause the illness of the next\r\noccupants; or as nesting-places for sitting hens, which may leave\r\ninsects in the crevices that will be difficult to eradicate.\r\n\r\nIn our descriptions of the various Breeds, we have given sufficient\r\ngeneral information upon the Exhibition Points from the best\r\nauthorities; but considerable differences of opinion have been expressed\r\nof late years, and eminent breeders dissent in some cases even from the\r\ngenerally recognised authority of the popular \"Standard of Excellence.\"\r\nWe, therefore, advise intending exhibitors to ascertain the standards to\r\nbe followed at the show and the predilections of the judges, and to\r\nbreed accordingly, or, if they object to the views held, not to compete\r\nat that exhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL TERMS.\r\n\r\n_Coverts._--The _upper_ and _lower wing coverts_ are those ranges of\r\nfeathers which cover the primary quills; and the _tail coverts_ are\r\nthose feathers growing on each side of the tail, and are longer than the\r\nbody feathers, but shorter than those of the tail.\r\n\r\n_Dubbing._--Cutting off the comb and wattles of a cock; an operation\r\nusually confined to Game cocks.\r\n\r\n_Ear-lobe._--The small feathers covering the organ of hearing, which is\r\nplaced a little behind the eye.\r\n\r\n_Flight._--The last five feathers of each wing.\r\n\r\n_Fluff._--The silky feathers growing on the thighs and hinder parts of\r\nCochin-China fowls.\r\n\r\n_Hackles._--The _neck hackles_ are feathers growing from the neck, and\r\ncovering the shoulders and part of the back; and the _saddle hackles_\r\nthose growing from the end of the back, and falling over the sides.\r\n\r\n_Legs._--The _legs_ are properly the lower and scaly limbs, the upper\r\npart covered with feathers and frequently mis-called legs, being\r\ncorrectly styled the _thighs_.\r\n\r\n_Primary Quills._--The long, strong quills, usually ten in number,\r\nforming the chief portion of each wing, and the means of flight.\r\n\r\n_Vulture-hocked._--Feathers growing from the thigh, and projecting\r\nbackwards below the knee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buff and White Cochin-China. Malay Cock. Light and Dark\r\nBrahmas.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCOCHIN-CHINAS, OR SHANGHAES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike many other fowls these possess a name which is incorrectly applied,\r\nfor they came from Shanghae, not Cochin-China, where they were\r\ncomparatively unknown. Mr. Fortune, who, from his travels in China, is\r\nwell qualified to give an opinion, states that they are a Chinese breed,\r\nkept in great numbers at Shanghae; the real Cochin-China breed being\r\nsmall and elegantly shaped. But all attempts to give them the name of\r\nthe port from which they were brought have failed, and the majority of\r\nbreeders persist in calling them Cochins. In the United States both\r\nnames are used, the feather-legged being called Shanghaes, and the\r\nclean-legged Cochins.\r\n\r\nThe first Shanghae fowls brought to this country were sent from India to\r\nHer Majesty, which gave them great importance; and the eggs having been\r\nfreely distributed by the kindness of the Queen and the Prince Consort,\r\nthe breed was soon widely spread. They were first introduced into this\r\ncountry when the northern ports of China, including Shanghae, were\r\nthrown open to European vessels on the conclusion of the Chinese war in\r\n1843; but some assign the date of their introduction from 1844 to 1847,\r\nand say that those called Cochins, exhibited by the Queen in 1843, were\r\nnot the true breed, having been not only entirely without feathers on\r\nthe shanks, but also altogether different in form and general\r\ncharacteristics. A pair which were sent by Her Majesty for exhibition at\r\nthe Dublin Cattle Show in April, 1846, created such a sensation from\r\ntheir great size and immense weight, and the full, loud, deep-pitched\r\ncrowing of the cock, that almost every one seemed desirous to possess\r\nsome of the breed, and enormous prices were given for the eggs and\r\nchickens. With his propensity for exaggeration, Paddy boasted that they\r\nlaid five eggs in two days, each weighing three ounces, that the fowls\r\nequalled turkeys in size, and \"Cochin eggs became in as great demand as\r\nthough they had been laid by the fabled golden goose. Philosophers,\r\npoets, merchants, and sweeps had alike partook of the mania; and\r\nalthough the latter could hardly come up to the price of a real Cochin,\r\nthere were plenty of vagabond dealers about, with counterfeit crossed\r\nbirds of all kinds, which were advertised to be the genuine article. For\r\nto such a pitch did the excitement rise, that they who never kept a fowl\r\nin their lives, and would hardly know a Bantam from a Dorking, puzzled\r\ntheir shallow brains as to the proper place to keep them, and the proper\r\ndiet to feed them on.\" Their justly-deserved popularity speedily grew\r\ninto a mania, and the price which had been from fifteen to thirty\r\nshillings each, then considered a high price for a fowl, rose to ten\r\npounds for a fine specimen, and ultimately a hundred guineas was\r\nrepeatedly paid for a single cock, and was not an uncommon price for a\r\npair of really fine birds. \"They were afterwards bred,\" says Miss Watts,\r\n\"for qualities difficult of attainment, and, as the result proved,\r\nlittle worth trying for,\" and \"fowls with _many_ excellent qualities\r\nwere blamed for not being _perfect_,\" and they fell from their high\r\nplace, and were as unjustly depreciated as they had been unduly exalted.\r\n\r\n\"Had these birds,\" wrote Mr. Baily many years since, \"been shy\r\nbreeders--if like song birds the produce of a pair were four, or at most\r\nfive, birds in the year, prices might have been maintained; but as they\r\nare marvellous layers they increased. They bred in large numbers, and\r\nconsequently became cheaper, and then the mania ended, because those who\r\ndealt most largely in them did so not from a love of the birds or the\r\npursuit, but as a speculation. As they had over-praised them before,\r\nthey now treated them with contempt. Anything like a moderate profit was\r\ndespised, and the birds were left to their own merits. These were\r\nsufficient to ensure their popularity, and now after fluctuating in\r\nvalue more than anything except shares, after being over-praised and\r\nthen abused, they have remained favourites with a large portion of the\r\npublic, sell at a remunerating price, and form one of the largest\r\nclasses at all the great exhibitions.\" This has proved to be a perfectly\r\ncorrect view, and the breed is now firmly established in public\r\nestimation, and unusually fine birds will still sell for from five to\r\ntwenty pounds each. The mania did great service to the breeding and\r\nimprovement of poultry by awakening an interest in the subject\r\nthroughout the kingdom which has lasted.\r\n\r\nThey are the best of all fowls for a limited space, and not inclined to\r\nwander even when they have an extensive run. They cannot fly, and a\r\nfence three feet high will keep them in. But if kept in a confined space\r\nthey must have an unlimited supply of green food. They give us eggs when\r\nthey are most expensive, and indeed, with regard to new-laid eggs, when\r\nthey are almost impossible to be had at any price. They begin to lay\r\nsoon after they are five months old, regardless of the season or\r\nweather, and lay throughout the year, except when requiring to sit,\r\nwhich they do twice or thrice a year, and some oftener. Pullets will\r\nsometimes lay at fourteen weeks, and want to sit before they are six\r\nmonths old. Cochins have been known to lay twice in a day, but not again\r\non the following day, and the instances are exceptional. Their eggs are\r\nof a pale chocolate colour, of excellent flavour, and usually weigh\r\n2-1/4 ounces each. They are excellent sitters and mothers. Pullets will\r\nfrequently hatch, lay again, and sit with the chickens of the first\r\nbrood around them. Cochins are most valuable as sitters early in the\r\nyear, being broody when other fowls are beginning to lay; but unless\r\ncooped they are apt to leave their chickens too soon, especially for\r\nearly broods, and lay again. They are very hardy, and their chickens\r\neasy to rear, doing well even in bleak places without any unusual care.\r\nBut they are backward in fledging, chickens bred from immature fowls\r\nbeing the most backward. Those which are cockerels show their flight\r\nfeathers earliest. They are very early matured.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Poultry Chronicle_ well says: \"These fowls were sent\r\nto provide food for man; by many they are not thought good table fowls;\r\nbut when others fail, if you keep them, you shall never want the luxury\r\nof a really new-laid egg on your breakfast table. The snow may fall, the\r\nfrost may be thick on your windows when you first look out on a December\r\nmorning, but your Cochins will provide you eggs. Your children shall\r\nlearn gentleness and kindness from them, for they are kind and gentle,\r\nand you shall be at peace with your neighbours, for they will not wander\r\nnor become depredators. They have fallen in price because they were\r\nunnaturally exalted; but their sun is not eclipsed; they have good\r\nqualities, and valuable. They shall now be within the reach of all; and\r\nwill make the delight of many by their domestic habits, which will allow\r\nthem to be kept where others would be an annoyance.\" They will let you\r\ntake them off their roost, handle and examine them, and put them back\r\nwithout struggling.\r\n\r\nThe fault of the Cochin-Chinas as table birds is, that they produce most\r\nmeat on the inferior parts; thus, there is generally too little on the\r\nbreast which is the prime part of a fowl, while the leg which is an\r\ninferior part, is unusually fleshy, but it must be admitted that the leg\r\nis more tender than in other breeds. A greater quantity of flesh may be\r\nraised within a given time, on a certain quantity of food, from these\r\nfowls than from any other breed. The cross with the Dorking is easily\r\nreared, and produces a very heavy and well-shaped fowl for the table,\r\nand a good layer.\r\n\r\n\"A great hue and cry,\" says Miss Watts, \"has been raised against the\r\nCochin-Chinas as fowls for the table, but we believe none have bestowed\r\nattention on breeding them with a view to this valuable consideration.\r\nSquare, compact, short-legged birds have been neglected for a certain\r\ncolour of feather, and a broad chest was given up for the wedge-form at\r\nthe very time that was pronounced a fault in the fowl. It is said that\r\nyellow-legged fowls are yellow also in the skin, and that white skin and\r\nwhite legs accompany each other; but how pertinaciously the yellow leg\r\nof the Cochin is adhered to! Yet all who have bred them will attest\r\nthat a little careful breeding would perpetuate white-legged Cochins.\r\nExhibitions are generally excellent; but to this fowl they certainly\r\nhave only been injurious, by exaggerating useless and fancy qualities at\r\nthe expense of those which are solid and useful. Who would favour, or\r\neven sanction, a Dorking in which size and shape, and every property we\r\nvalue in them, was sacrificed to an endeavour to breed to a particular\r\ncolour? and this is what we have been doing with the Cochin-China. Many\r\nbreeders say, eat Cochins while very young; but we have found them much\r\nbetter for the table as fowls than as chickens. A fine Cochin, from five\r\nto seven months old, is like a turkey, and very juicy and fine in\r\nflavour.\"\r\n\r\nA peculiar characteristic of these birds, technically called \"fluff,\" is\r\na quantity of beautifully soft, long feathers, covering the thighs till\r\nthey project considerably, and garnishing all the hinder parts of the\r\nbird in the same manner, so that the broadest part of the bird is\r\nbehind. Its quality is a good indication of the breed; if fine and downy\r\nthe birds are probably well-bred, but if rank and coarse they are\r\ninferior. The cocks are frequently somewhat scanty in \"fluff,\" but\r\nshould be chosen with as much as possible; but vulture-hocks which often\r\naccompany the heaviest feathered birds should be avoided, as they now\r\ndisqualify at the best shows. \"The fluff,\" says a good authority, \"in\r\nthe hen especially, should so cover the tail feathers as to give the\r\nappearance of a very short back, the line taking an upward direction\r\nfrom within an inch or so of the point of junction with the hackle.\" The\r\nlast joint of the wings folds up, so that the ends of the flight\r\nfeathers are concealed by the middle feathers, and their extremities are\r\nagain covered by the copious saddle, which peculiarity has caused them\r\nto be also called the ostrich-fowl.\r\n\r\nA good Cochin cock should be compact, large, and square built; broad\r\nacross the loins and hind-quarters; with a deep keel; broad, short back;\r\nshort neck; small, delicately-shaped, well-arched head; short, strong,\r\ncurved beak; rather small, finely and evenly serrated, straight, single,\r\nerect comb, wholly free from reduplications and sprigs; brilliant red\r\nface, and pendant wattles; long hanging ear-lobe, of pure red, white\r\nbeing inadmissible; bright, bold eye, approaching the plumage in colour;\r\nrich, full, long hackle; small, closely-folded wings; short tail,\r\nscarcely any in some fine specimens, not very erect, with slightly\r\ntwisted glossy feathers falling over it like those of the ostrich; stout\r\nlegs set widely apart, yellow and heavily feathered to the toe; and\r\nerect carriage. The chief defect of the breed is narrowness of breast,\r\nwhich should therefore be sought for as full as possible.\r\n\r\nThe hen's body is much deeper in proportion than that of the cock. She\r\nresembles him upon most points, but differs in some; her comb having\r\nmany indentations; the fluff being softer, and of almost silky quality;\r\nthe tail has upright instead of falling feathers, and comes to a blunt\r\npoint; and her carriage is less upright.\r\n\r\nCochins lose their beauty earlier than any other breed, and moult with\r\nmore difficulty each time. They are in their greatest beauty at from\r\nnine to eighteen months old. The cocks' tails increase with age. In\r\nbuying Cochins avoid clean legs, fifth toes, which show that it has been\r\ncrossed with the Dorking, double combs that betray Malay blood, and long\r\ntails, particularly taking care that the cock has not, and ascertaining\r\nthat he never had, sickle feathers. The cock ought not to weigh less\r\nthan ten or eleven pounds, and a very fine bird will reach thirteen; the\r\nhens from eight to ten pounds.\r\n\r\nThe principal colours now bred are Buff, Cinnamon, Partridge, Grouse,\r\nBlack, and White. The Buff and White are the most popular.\r\n\r\nBuff birds may have black in the tails of both sexes, but the less there\r\nis the better. Black-pencilling in the hackle is considered\r\nobjectionable at good shows. The cock's neck hackles, wing coverts,\r\nback, and saddle hackles, are usually of a rich gold colour, but his\r\nbreast and the lower parts of his body should match with those of his\r\nhens. Buff birds generally produce chickens lighter than themselves.\r\nMost birds become rather lighter at each moult. In making up an\r\nexhibition pen, observe that Grouse and Partridge hens should have a\r\nblack-breasted cock; and that Buff and Cinnamon birds should not be\r\nplaced together, but all the birds in the pen should be either Buff or\r\nCinnamon. The Cinnamon are of two shades, the Light Cinnamon and the\r\nSilver, which is a pale washy tint, that looks very delicate and pretty\r\nwhen perfectly clean. Silver Cinnamon hens should not be penned with a\r\npale Yellow cock, but with one as near to their own tint as can be\r\nfound. Mr. Andrews's celebrated strain of Cochins sometimes produced\r\nboth cocks and hens which were Silver Cinnamon, with streaks of gold in\r\nthe hackle.\r\n\r\nIn Partridge birds the cock's neck and saddle hackles should be of a\r\nbright red, striped with black, his back and wings of dark red, the\r\nlatter crossed with a well-defined bar of metallic greenish black, and\r\nthe breast and under parts of his body should be black, and not mottled.\r\nThe hen's neck hackles should be of bright gold, striped with black, and\r\nall the other portions of her body of a light brown, pencilled with very\r\ndark brown. The Grouse are very dark Partridge, have a very rich\r\nappearance, and are particularly beautiful when laced. They are far from\r\ncommon, and well worth cultivating. The Partridge are more mossed in\r\ntheir markings, and not so rich in colour as the Grouse. Cuckoo Cochins\r\nare marked like the Cuckoo Dorkings, and difficult to breed free of\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nThe White and Black were introduced later than the others. Mr. Baily\r\nsays the White were principally bred from a pair imported and given to\r\nthe Dean of Worcester, and which afterwards became the property of Mrs.\r\nHerbert, of Powick. White Cochins for exhibition must have yellow legs,\r\nand they are prone to green. The origin of the Black is disputed. It is\r\nsaid to be a sport from the White, or to have been produced by a cross\r\nbetween the Buff and the White. By careful breeding it has been fixed as\r\na decided sub-variety, but it is difficult, if not almost impossible, to\r\nrear a cock to complete maturity entirely free from coloured feathers.\r\nThey keep perfectly pure in colour till six months old, after which age\r\nthey sometimes show a golden patch or red feathers upon the wing, or a\r\nfew streaks of red upon the hackle, of so dark a shade as to be\r\nimperceptible except in a strong light, and are often found on close\r\nexamination to have white under feathers, and others barred with white.\r\n\r\nThe legs in all the colours should be yellow. Flesh-coloured legs are\r\nadmissible, but green, black, or white are defects. In the Partridge and\r\nGrouse a slight wash, as of indigo, appears to be thrown over them,\r\nwhich in the Black assumes a still darker shade; but in all three yellow\r\nshould appear partially even here beneath the scales, as the pink tinge\r\ndoes in the Buff and White birds.\r\n\r\nCochin-Chinas being much inclined to accumulate internal fat, which\r\nfrequently results in apoplexy, should not be fed on food of a very\r\nfattening character, such as Indian corn. They are liable to have\r\ninflamed feet if they are obliged to roost on very high, small, or sharp\r\nperches, or allowed to run over sharp-edged stones.\r\n\r\nThey are also subject to an affection called White Comb, which is a\r\nwhite mouldy eruption on the comb and wattles like powdered chalk; and\r\nif not properly treated in time, will spread over the whole body,\r\ncausing the feathers to fall off. It is caused by want of cleanliness,\r\nover-stimulating or bad food, and most frequently by want of green food,\r\nwhich must be supplied, and the place rubbed with an ointment composed\r\nof two parts of cocoanut oil, and one of turmeric powder, to which some\r\npersons add one half part of sulphur; and six grains of jalap may be\r\ngiven to clear the bowels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nBRAHMA-POOTRAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a disputed point among great authorities whether Brahmas form a\r\ndistinct variety, or whether they originated in a cross with the Cochin,\r\nand have become established by careful breeding. When they were first\r\nintroduced, Mr. Baily considered them to be a distinct breed, and has\r\nsince seen nothing to alter his opinion. Their nature and habits are\r\nquite dissimilar, for they wander from home and will get their own\r\nliving where a Cochin would starve, have more spirit, deeper breasts,\r\nare hardier, lay larger eggs, are less prone to sit, and never produce a\r\nclean-legged chicken. Whatever their origin, by slow and sure degrees,\r\nwithout any mania, they have become more and more popular, standing upon\r\ntheir own merits, and are now one of the most favourite varieties.\r\n\r\n\"The worst accusation,\" says Miss Watts, \"their enemies can advance\r\nagainst them is, that no one knows their origin; but this is applicable\r\nto them only as it is when applied to Dorkings, Spanish, Polands, and\r\nall the other kinds which have been brought to perfection by careful\r\nbreeding, working on good originals. All we have in England are\r\ndescended from fowls imported from the United States, and the best\r\naccount of them is, that a sailor (rather vague, certainly) appeared in\r\nan American town (Boston or New York, I forget which) with a new kind of\r\nfowl for sale, and that a pair bought from him were the parents of all\r\nthe Brahmas. Uncertain as this appears, the accounts of those who\r\npretend to trace their origin as cross-bred fowls is, at least, equally\r\nso, and I believe we may just act towards the Brahmas as we do with\r\nregard to Dorkings and other good fowls, and be satisfied to possess a\r\nfirst-rate, useful kind, although we may be unable to trace its\r\ngenealogical tree back to the root. Whatever may be their origin, I find\r\nthem distinct in their characteristics. I have found them true to their\r\npoints, generation after generation, in all the years that I have kept\r\nthem. The pea-comb is very peculiar, and I have never had one chicken\r\nuntrue in this among all that I have bred. Their habits are very unlike\r\nthe Cochins. Although docile, they are much less inert; they lay a\r\nlarger number of eggs, and sit less frequently. Many of my hens only\r\nwish to sit once a year; a few oftener than that, perhaps twice or even\r\nthree times in rare instances, but never at the end of each small batch\r\nof eggs, as I find (my almost equal favourites) the Cochins do. The\r\ndivision of Light and Dark Brahmas is a fancy of the judges, which any\r\none who keeps them can humour with a little care in breeding. My idea of\r\ntheir colour is, that it should be black and grey (iron grey, with more\r\nor less of a blue tinge, and devoid of any brown) on a clear white\r\nground, and I do not care whether the white or the marking predominates.\r\nI believe breeders could bear me out, if they would, when I say many\r\nfowls which pass muster as Brahmas are the result of a cross, employed\r\nto increase size and procure the heavy colour which some of the judges\r\naffect.\"\r\n\r\nFor strength of constitution, both as chickens and fowls, they surpass\r\nall other breeds. Brahmas like an extensive range, but bear confinement\r\nas well as any fowls, and keep cleaner in dirty or smoky places than any\r\nthat have white feathers. They are capital foragers where they have\r\ntheir liberty, are smaller eaters and less expensive to keep than\r\nCochins, and most prolific in eggs. They lay regularly on an average\r\nfive fine large eggs a week all the year round, even when snow is on the\r\nground, except when moulting or tending their brood. Mr. Boyle, of Bray,\r\nIreland, the most eminent breeder of Dark Brahmas in Great Britain, says\r\nhe has \"repeatedly known pullets begin to lay in autumn, and _never\r\nstop_--let it be hail, rain, snow, or storm--for a single day till next\r\nspring.\" They usually lay from thirty to forty eggs before they seek to\r\nsit. The hens do not sit so often as Cochins, and a week's change of\r\nplace will generally banish the desire. They put on flesh well, with\r\nplenty of breast-meat, and are more juicy and better shaped for the\r\ntable than most Cochins; though, after they are six months old, the\r\nflesh is much inferior to that of the Dorking. A cross with a Dorking or\r\nCreve-Coeur cock produces the finest possible table fowl, carrying\r\nalmost incredible quantities of meat of excellent quality.\r\n\r\nThe chickens are hardy and easy to rear. They vary in colour when first\r\nhatched, being all shades of brown, yellow, and grey, and are often\r\nstreaked on the back and spotted about the head; but this variety gives\r\nplace, as the feathers come, to the mixture of black, white, and grey,\r\nwhich forms the distinguishing colour of the Brahma. Mr. Baily has\r\n\"hatched them in snow, and reared them all out of doors without any\r\nother shelter than a piece of mat or carpet thrown over the coop at\r\nnight.\" They reach their full size at an early age, and the pullets are\r\nin their prime at eight months. Miss Watts noticed that Brahmas \"are\r\nmore clever in the treatment of themselves when they are ill than other\r\nfowls; when they get out of order, they will generally fast until eating\r\nis no longer injurious,\" which peculiarity is corroborated by the\r\nexperienced \"Henwife.\" The feathers of the Brahma-Pootra are said to be\r\nnearly equal to goose feathers.\r\n\r\nThe head should have a slight fulness over the eye, giving breadth to\r\nthe top; a full, pearl eye is much admired, but far from common; comb\r\neither a small single, or pea-comb--the single resembling that of the\r\nCochin; the neck short; the breast wide and full; the legs short,\r\nyellow, and well-feathered, but not so fully as in the finest Cochins;\r\nand the tail short but full, and in the cock opening into a fan. They\r\nshould be wide and deep made, large and weighty, and have a free, noble\r\ncarriage, equally distinct from the waddle of the Cochin, and the erect\r\nbearing of the Malay. Unlike the Cochins, they keep constantly to their\r\ncolour, which is a mixture of black, white, and grey; the lightest being\r\nalmost white, and the darkest consisting of grey markings on a white\r\nground. The colour is entirely a matter of taste, but the bottom colour\r\nshould always be grey.\r\n\r\n\"After breeding Brahmas for many years,\" says Miss Watts, \"through many\r\ngenerations and crosses (always, however, keeping to families imported\r\ndirect from America), we are quite confirmed in the opinion that the\r\npea-comb is _the_ comb for the Brahma; and this seems now a settled\r\nquestion, for single-combed birds never take prizes when passable\r\npea-combed birds are present. The leading characteristic of the peculiar\r\ncomb, named by the Americans the pea-comb, is its triple character. It\r\nmay be developed and separated almost like three combs, or nearly united\r\ninto one; but its triple form is always evident. What we think most\r\nbeautiful is, where the centre division is a little fluted, slightly\r\nserrated, and flanked by two little side combs. The degree of the\r\ndivision into three varies, and the peculiarities of the comb may be\r\nless perceptible in December than when the hens are laying; but the\r\ntriple character of the pea-comb is always evident. It shows itself in\r\nthe chick at a few days old, in three tiny paralleled lines.\" It is\r\nthick at the base, and like three combs joined into one, the centre comb\r\nbeing higher than the other, but the comb altogether must be low,\r\nrounded at the top, and the indentations must not be deep. Whether\r\nsingle or triple, all the combs in a pen should be uniform.\r\n\r\nThe dark and light varieties should not be crossed, as, according to Mr.\r\nTeebay, who was formerly the most extensive and successful breeder of\r\nBrahmas in England, the result is never satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMALAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the first of the gigantic Asiatic breeds imported into this\r\ncountry, and in height and size exceeds any fowl yet known. The origin\r\nof the Malay breed is supposed to be the _Gallus giganteus_ of Temminck.\r\n\"This large and very remarkable species,\" says Mr. W. C. L. Martin, \"is\r\na native of Java and Sumatra. The comb is thick and low, and destitute\r\nof serrations, appearing as if it had been partially cut off; the\r\nwattles are small, and the throat is bare. The neck is covered with\r\nelongated feathers, or hackles, of a pale golden-reddish colour, which\r\nadvance upon the back, and hackles of the same colour cover the rump,\r\nand drop on each side of the base of the tail. The middle of the back\r\nand the shoulders of the wings are of a dark chestnut, the feathers\r\nbeing of a loose texture. The greater wing-coverts are of a glossy\r\ngreen, and form a bar of that colour across the wing. The primary and\r\nsecondary quill feathers are yellowish, with a tinge of rufous. The tail\r\nfeathers are of a glossy green. The under surface uniformly is of a\r\nglossy blackish green, but the base of each feather is a chestnut, and\r\nthis colour appears on the least derangement of the plumage. The limbs\r\nare remarkably stout, and the robust tarsi are of a yellow colour. The\r\nvoice is a sort of crow--hoarse and short, and very different from the\r\nclear notes of defiance uttered by our farmyard chanticleer. This\r\nspecies has the habit, when fatigued, of resting on the tarsi or legs,\r\nas we have seen the emu do under similar circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Proceedings of the Zoological Society\" for 1832, we find the\r\nfollowing notice respecting this breed, by Colonel Sykes, who observed\r\nit domesticated in the Deccan: \"Known by the name of the Kulm cock by\r\nEuropeans in India. Met with only as a domestic bird; and Colonel Sykes\r\nhas reason to believe that it is not a native of India, but has been\r\nintroduced by the Mussulmans from Sumatra or Java. The iris of the real\r\ngame bird should be whitish or straw yellow. Colonel Sykes landed two\r\ncocks and a hen in England in June, 1831. They bore the winter well; the\r\nhen laid freely, and has reared two broods of chickens. The cock has not\r\nthe shrill clear pipe of the domestic bird, and his scale of note\r\nappears more limited. A cock in the possession of Colonel Sykes stood\r\ntwenty-six inches high to the crown of the head; but they attain a\r\ngreater height. Length from the tip of the bill to the insertion of the\r\ntail, twenty-three inches. Hen one-third smaller than the male. Shaw\r\nvery justly describes the habit of the cock, of resting, when tired, on\r\nthe first joint of the leg.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a long, large, heavy bird, standing remarkably upright, having an\r\nalmost uninterrupted slope from the head to the insertion of the tail;\r\nwith very long, though strong, yellow legs, quite free from feathers;\r\nlong, stout, firm thighs, and stands very erect; the cock, when full\r\ngrown, being at least two feet six inches, and sometimes over three feet\r\nin height, and weighing from eight to eleven pounds. The head has great\r\nfulness over the eye, and is flattened above, resembling that of the\r\nsnake. The small, thick, hard comb, scarcely rising from the head, and\r\nbarely as long, like half a strawberry, resembles that of a Game fowl\r\ndubbed. The wattles are very small; the neck closely feathered, and like\r\na rope, with a space for an inch below the beak bare of feathers. It has\r\na hard, cruel expression of face; a brilliant bold eye, pearled around\r\nthe edge of the lids; skinny red face; very strong curved yellow beak;\r\nand small, drooping tail, with very beautiful, though short, sickle\r\nfeathers. The hen resembles the cock upon all these points, but is\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nTheir colours now comprise different shades of red and deep chestnut, in\r\ncombination with rich browns, and there are also black and white\r\nvarieties, each of which should be uniform. The feathers should be hard\r\nand close, which causes it to be heavier than it appears.\r\n\r\nMalays are inferior to most other breeds as layers, but the pullets\r\ncommence laying early, and are often good winter layers. Their eggs,\r\nwhich weigh about 2-1/2 ounces each, are of a deep buff or pale\r\nchocolate colour, surpass all others in flavour, and are so rich that\r\ntwo of them are considered to be equal to three of ordinary fowls. They\r\nare nearly always fertile.\r\n\r\nTheir chief excellence is as table fowls, carrying, as they do, a great\r\nquantity of meat, which, when under a year old, is of very good quality\r\nand flavour. Crossed with the Spanish and Dorking, they produce\r\nexcellent table fowls; the latter cross being also good layers.\r\n\r\nMalays are good sitters and mothers, if they have roomy nests. Their\r\nchickens should not be hatched after June, as they feather slowly, and\r\nare delicate; but the adult birds are hardy enough, and seem especially\r\nadapted to crowded localities, such as courts and alleys. \"Malays,\" says\r\nMr. Baily, \"will live anywhere; they will inhabit a back yard of small\r\ndimensions; they will scratch in the dust-hole, and roost under the\r\nwater-butt; and yet not only lay well, but show in good condition when\r\nrequisite.\" Like the Game fowl, it is terribly pugnacious, and in its\r\nnative country is kept and trained for fighting. This propensity, which\r\nis still greater in confinement, is its greatest disadvantage. When\r\nclosely confined they are apt to eat each other's feathers, the cure for\r\nwhich is turning them into a grass run, and giving them a good supply of\r\nlettuce leaves, with an occasional purgative of six grains of jalap. The\r\nChittagong is said to be a variety of the Malay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nGAME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the kind expressly called the English breed by Buffon and the\r\nFrench writers, and is the noblest and most beautiful of all breeds,\r\ncombining an admirable figure, brilliant plumage, and stately gait. It\r\nis most probably derived from the larger or continental Indian species\r\nof the Javanese, or Bankiva Jungle Fowl--the _Gallus Bankiva_ of\r\nTemminck--which is a distinct species, distinguished chiefly from the\r\nJavanese fowl by its larger size. (_See_ page 124.) Of this continental\r\nspecies, Sir W. Jardine states that he has seen three or four specimens,\r\nall of which came from India proper. The Game cock is the undisputed\r\nking of all poultry, and is unsurpassed for courage. The Malay is more\r\ncruel and ferocious, but has less real courage. Game fowls are in every\r\nrespect fighting birds, and, although cock-fighting is now very properly\r\nprohibited by law, Game fowls are always judged mainly in reference to\r\nfighting qualities. But their pugnacious disposition renders them very\r\ntroublesome, especially if they have not ample range, although it does\r\nnot disqualify them for small runs to the extent generally supposed. A\r\nblow with his spur is dangerous, and instances have been recorded of\r\nvery severe injuries inflicted upon children, even causing death. An old\r\nnewspaper states that \"Mr. Johnson, a farmer in the West Riding of\r\nYorkshire, who has a famous breed of the Game fowl, has had the great\r\nmisfortune to lose his little son, a boy of three years old, who was\r\nattacked by a Game cock, and so severely injured that he died shortly\r\nafterwards.\" High-bred hens are quite as pugnacious as the cocks. The\r\nchickens are very quarrelsome, and both cocks and hens fight so\r\nfuriously, that frequently one-half of a brood is destroyed, and the\r\nother half have to be killed.\r\n\r\nGame fowls are hardy when they can have liberty, but cannot be well kept\r\nin a confined space. They eat little, and are excellent for an\r\nunprotected place, because by their activity they avoid danger\r\nthemselves, and by their courage defend their chickens from enemies. The\r\nhen is a prolific layer, and, if she has a good run, equal to any breed.\r\nThe eggs, though of moderate size only, are remarkable for delicacy of\r\nflavour. She is an excellent sitter, and still more excellent mother.\r\nThe chickens are easily reared, require little food, and are more robust\r\nin constitution than almost any other variety.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the Game fowl is beautifully white, and superior to that of\r\nall other breeds for richness and delicacy of flavour. They should never\r\nbe put up to fat, as they are impatient of confinement. \"They are in no\r\nway fit for the fattening-coop,\" says Mr. Baily. \"They cannot bear the\r\nextra food without excitement, and that is not favourable to obesity.\r\nNevertheless, they have their merits. If they are reared like pheasants\r\nround a keeper's house, and allowed to run semi-wild in the woods, to\r\nfrequent sunny banks and dry ditches, they will grow up like them; they\r\nwill have little fat, but they will be full of meat. They must be eaten\r\nyoung; and a Game pullet four or five months old, caught up wild in this\r\nway, and killed two days before she is eaten, is, perhaps, the most\r\ndelicious chicken there is in point of flavour.\"\r\n\r\nThe Game-fowl continues to breed for many years without showing any\r\nsigns of decay, and in this respect is superior to the Cochin, Brahma,\r\nand even to the Dorking.\r\n\r\nThe cock's head should be long, but fine; beak long, curved, and strong;\r\ncomb single, small, upright, and bright red; wattles and face bright\r\nred; eyes large and brilliant; neck long, arched, and strong; breast\r\nwell developed; back short and broad between the shoulders, but tapering\r\nto the tail; thighs muscular, but short compared to the shanks; spur\r\nlow; foot flat, with powerful claws, and his carriage erect. The form of\r\nthe hen should resemble the above on a smaller scale, with small, fine\r\ncomb and face, and wattles of a less intense red. The feathers of both\r\nshould be very hard, firm, and close, very strong in the quills, and\r\nseem so united that it should be almost impossible to ruffle them, each\r\nfeather if lifted up falling readily into its original place. Size is\r\nnot a point of merit, from four to six pounds being considered\r\nsufficient, and better than heavier weights. Among the list of\r\nimperfections in Game cocks, Sketchley enumerates \"flat sides, short\r\nlegs, thin thighs, crooked or indented breast, short thin neck,\r\nimperfect eye, and duck or short feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the custom,\" says Miss Watts, \"consequently imperative, that all\r\nbirds which are exhibited should have been dubbed, and this should not\r\nbe done until the comb is so much developed that it will not spring\r\nagain after the dubbing. This will be safe if the chicken is nearly six\r\nmonths old, but some are more set than others at a certain age. A keen\r\npair of scissors is the best instrument with which to operate. Hold the\r\nfowl with a firm hand, cut away the deaf ears and wattles, then cut the\r\ncomb, cutting a certain distance from the back, and then from the front\r\nto join this cut, taking especial care not to go too near the skull.\r\nSome operators put a finger inside the mouth to get a firm purchase. We\r\nshould like to see dubbing done away with, leaving these beautiful fowls\r\nas nature makes them; but since amateurs and shows will not agree to\r\nthis, it is best to give directions for dubbing, as an operation\r\nbunglingly performed is sure to give unnecessary pain.\" To save the bird\r\nfrom excessive loss of blood his wattles are usually cut off a week\r\nlater. Every superfluous piece of flesh and skin should be removed.\r\n\r\nThe \"Henwife\" well says: \"Why these poor birds are condemned to submit\r\nto this cruel operation is a mystery, unfathomable, I suspect, even by\r\nthe judges themselves. Cock-fighting being forbidden by law, the cocks\r\nshould, on principle, be left undubbed, as a protest against this brutal\r\namusement. The comb of the Game male bird is as beautifully formed as\r\nthat of the Dorking; why then rob it of this great ornament? It is\r\nasserted that it is necessary to remove the comb to prevent the cocks\r\ninjuring each other fatally in fighting; but this is not true; a Dorking\r\nwill fight for the championship as ardently as any Game bird, and yet\r\nhis comb is spared. Cockerels will not quarrel if kept apart from hens\r\nuntil the breeding season, when they should be separated, and put on\r\ntheir several walks. If pugnaciously inclined I do not believe that the\r\nabsence of the comb will save the weaker opponent from destruction;\r\ntherefore I raise my voice for pity, in favour of the beautiful Game\r\ncock.\"\r\n\r\nThe colours are various, and they are classed into numerous varieties\r\nand sub-varieties, of which the chief are--Black-breasted Red;\r\nBrown-Red; Silver Duck-wing Greys, so called from the feathers\r\nresembling those of a duck; Greys; Blues; Duns; Piles, or Pieds; Black;\r\nWhite; and Brassy-winged, which is Black with yellow on the lesser wing\r\ncoverts. Colours and markings must be allowed a somewhat wide range in\r\nthis breed; and figure, with courage, may be held to prove purity of\r\nblood though the colour be doubtful. Mr. Douglas considers the\r\nBlack-breasted Red the finest feathered Game, and states that he never\r\nfound any come so true to colour as a brood of that variety. White in\r\nthe tail feathers is highly objectionable, though not an absolute\r\ndisqualification. White fowls should be entirely white, with white legs.\r\nThe rules for the coloured legs are very undecided. Light legs match\r\nlight-coloured birds best. No particular colour is imperative, but it\r\nshould harmonise with the plumage, and all in a pen must agree.\r\n\r\nThe best layers are the Black-breasted Reds with willow legs, and the\r\nworst the Greys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nDORKINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the finest breeds, and especially English. A pure Dorking\r\nis distinguished by an additional or fifth toe. There are several\r\nvarieties, which are all comprised in two distinct classes--the White\r\nand the Coloured. The rose-combed white breed is _the_ Dorking of the\r\nold fanciers, and most probably the original breed, from which the\r\ncoloured varieties were produced by crossing it with the old Sussex, or\r\nsome other large coloured fowl. \"That such was the case,\" says Mr.\r\nWright, \"is almost proved by the fact that only a few years ago nothing\r\nwas more uncertain than the appearance of the fifth toe in coloured\r\nchickens, even of the best strains. Such uncertainty in any important\r\npoint is always an indication of mixed blood; and that it was so in this\r\ncase is shown by the result of long and careful breeding, which has now\r\nrendered the fifth toe permanent, and finally established the variety.\"\r\nMr. Brent says: \"The _old_ Dorking, the _pure_ Dorking, the _only_\r\nDorking, is the _White_ Dorking. It is of good size, compact and plump\r\nform, with short neck, short white legs, five toes, a full rose-comb, a\r\nlarge breast, and a plumage of spotless white. The practice of crossing\r\nwith a Game cock was much in vogue with the old breeders, to improve a\r\nworn-out stock (which, however, would have been better accomplished by\r\nprocuring a fresh bird of the same kind, but not related). This cross\r\nshows itself in single combs, loss of a claw, or an occasional red\r\nfeather, but what is still more objectionable, in pale-yellow legs and a\r\nyellow circle about the beak, which also indicates a yellowish skin.\r\nThese, then, are faults to be avoided. As regards size, the White\r\nDorking is generally inferior to the Sussex fowl (or 'coloured\r\nDorking'), but in this respect it only requires attention and careful\r\nbreeding. The pure White Dorking may truly be considered as fancy stock,\r\nas well as useful, because they will breed true to their points; but the\r\ngrey Sussex, Surrey or Coloured Dorking, often sport. To the breeders\r\nand admirers of the so-called 'Coloured Dorkings' I would say, continue\r\nto improve the fowl of your choice, but let him be known by his right\r\ntitle; do not support him on another's fame, nor yet deny that the\r\nrose-comb or fifth toe is essential to a Dorking, because your\r\nfavourites are not constant to those points. The absence of the fifth\r\nclaw to the Dorking would be a great defect, but to the Sussex fowl\r\n(erroneously called a 'Coloured Dorking') it is my opinion it would be\r\nan improvement, provided the leg did not get longer with the loss.\"\r\n\r\nThe fifth toe should not be excessively large, or too far above the\r\nordinary toe.\r\n\r\nThe White Dorking must have the plumage uniformly white, though in the\r\nolder birds the hackle and saddle may attain a light golden tint. The\r\nrose-comb is preferable, and the beak and legs should be light and\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nThe Coloured Dorking is now bred to great size and beauty. It is a\r\nlarge, plump, compact, square-made bird, with short white legs, and\r\nshould have a well-developed fifth toe. The plumage is very varied, and\r\nmay have a wide range, and might almost be termed immaterial, provided a\r\ncoarse mealy appearance be avoided, and the pen is well matched. This\r\nlatitude in respect of plumage is so generally admitted that the\r\nassertion \"you cannot breed Dorkings true to colour,\" has almost\r\nacquired the authority of a proverb. They may be shown with either rose\r\nor single combs, but all the birds in a pen must match.\r\n\r\nThe Dorking is the perfection of a table bird, combining\r\ndelicately-flavoured white flesh, which is produced in greatest quantity\r\nin the choicest parts--the breast, merry-thought, and wings--equal\r\ndistribution of fat, and symmetrical shape. Mr. Baily prefers the\r\nSpeckled or Grey to the White, as \"they are larger, hardier, and fatten\r\nmore readily, and although it may appear anomalous, it is not less true\r\nthat white-feathered poultry has a tendency to yellowness in the flesh\r\nand fat.\" Size is an important point in Dorkings. Coloured prize birds\r\nweigh from seven to fourteen pounds, and eight months' chickens six or\r\nseven pounds. The White Dorking is smaller.\r\n\r\nThey are not good layers, except when very young, and are bad winter\r\nlayers. The eggs are large, averaging 2-3/4 ounces, pure white, very\r\nmuch rounded, and nearly equal in size at each end. The hen is an\r\nexcellent sitter and mother. The chickens are very delicate, requiring\r\nmore care when young than most breeds, and none show a greater\r\nmortality, no more than two-thirds of a brood usually surviving the\r\nfourth week of their life. They should not be hatched before March, and\r\nmust be kept on gravel soil, hard clay, or other equally dry ground, and\r\nnever on brick, stone, or wooden flooring.\r\n\r\nThis breed will only thrive on a dry soil. They are fond of a wide\r\nrange, and cannot be kept within a fence of less than seven feet in\r\nheight. When allowed unlimited range they appear to grow hardy, and are\r\nas easily reared as any other breed if not hatched too early. If kept in\r\nconfinement they should have fresh turf every day, besides other\r\nvegetable food. Dorkings degenerate more than any breed by\r\ninter-breeding, and rapidly decrease in size.\r\n\r\nDorkings are peculiarly subject to a chronic inflammation or abscess of\r\nthe foot, known as \"bumble-foot,\" which probably originated in heavy\r\nfowls descending from high perches and walking over sharp stones. The\r\nadditional toe may have rendered them more liable to this disease. It\r\nmay now arise from the same cause, and is best prevented by using broad,\r\nlow perches, and keeping their runs clear of sharp, rough stones, but it\r\nalso appears to have become hereditary in some birds. There is no cure\r\nfor it when matured except its removal, and this operation fails oftener\r\nthan it succeeds; but Mr. Tegetmeier states, that he has in early cases\r\nremoved the corn-like or wart-like tumours on the ball of the foot with\r\nwhich the disease begins, and cauterised the part with nitrate of silver\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Golden-pencilled and Silver-spangled Hamburgs. Black\r\nSpanish]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nSPANISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis splendid breed was originally imported from Spain, and is\r\ncharacterised by its peculiar white face, which in the cock should\r\nextend from the comb downwards, including the entire face, and meet\r\nbeneath in a white cravat, hidden by the wattles; and in the hen should\r\nbe equally striking. The plumage is perfectly black, with brilliant\r\nmetallic lustre, reflecting rich green and purple tints. The tail should\r\nresemble a sickle in the cock, and be square in the hen. The comb should\r\nbe of a bright red, large, and high, upright in the cock, but pendent in\r\nthe hen; the legs blue, clean, and long, and the bearing proud and\r\ngallant.\r\n\r\nWith care they will thrive in a very small space, and are perhaps better\r\nadapted for town than any other variety. They are tolerably hardy when\r\ngrown, but suffer much from cold and wet. Their combs and wattles are\r\nliable to be injured by severe cold, from which these fowls should be\r\ncarefully protected. If frost-bitten, the parts should be rubbed with\r\nsnow or cold water, and the birds must not be taken into a warm room\r\nuntil recovered.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish are excellent layers, producing five or six eggs weekly from\r\nFebruary to August, and two or three weekly from November to February,\r\nand also laying earlier than any other breed except the Brahma, the\r\npullets beginning to lay before they are six months old. Although the\r\nhens are only of an average size, and but moderate eaters, their eggs\r\nare larger than those of any other breed, averaging 3-1/2 ounces, and\r\nsome weighing 4-1/2 ounces, each. The shells are very thin and white,\r\nand the largest eggs are laid in the spring.\r\n\r\nThe flesh is excellent, but the body is small compared to that of the\r\nDorking. They very seldom show any inclination to sit, and if they hatch\r\na brood are bad nurses. The chickens are very delicate, and are best\r\nhatched at the end of April and during May. They do not feather till\r\nalmost three-parts grown, and require a steady mother that will keep\r\nwith them till they are safely feathered, and therefore the eggs should\r\nbe set under a Dorking hen, because that breed remains longer with the\r\nchicks than any other. They almost always have white feathers in the\r\nflight of the wings, but these become black.\r\n\r\n\"In purchasing Spanish fowls,\" says an excellent authority, \"blue legs,\r\nthe entire absence of white or coloured feathers in the plumage, and a\r\nlarge white face, with a very large, high comb, which should be erect in\r\nthe cock, though pendent in the hen, should be insisted on.\" Legginess\r\nis a fault that breeders must be careful to avoid.\r\n\r\nThe cockerels show the white face earlier than the pullets, and a blue,\r\nshrivelly appearance in the face of the chickens is a better sign of\r\nfuture whiteness than a red fleshiness. Pullets are rarely fully\r\nwhite-faced till above a year old. \"The white face,\" says an excellent\r\nauthority, \"should always extend well around the eye, and up to the\r\npoint of junction with the comb, though a line of short black feathers\r\nis there frequently seen to intrude its undesired presence. It is\r\ncertainly objectionable, and the less of it the better; but any attempt\r\nto remove or disguise this eyesore should be followed by immediate\r\ndisqualification.\" Some exhibitors of Spanish shave the down of the\r\nedges of the white-face, in order to make it smooth and larger. This\r\ndisgraceful practice is not allowed at the Birmingham Show.\r\n\r\n\"One test of condition,\" says Mr. Baily, \"more particularly of the\r\npullets, is the state of the comb, which will be red, soft, and\r\ndeveloped, just in proportion to the condition of the bird. While\r\nmoulting--and they are almost naked during this process--the comb\r\nentirely shrivels up.\"\r\n\r\nThe White-faced WHITE SPANISH is thought to be merely a sport of the\r\nWhite-faced Black Spanish. But, whatever their origin may have been,\r\nthey possess every indication of common blood with their Black\r\nrelatives, and their claims to appear by their side in the exhibition\r\nroom are as good as those of the White Cochins and the White Polish. The\r\nplumage is uniformly white, but in all other respects they resemble the\r\nBlack breed. From the absence of contrast of colour shown in the face,\r\ncomb, and plumage of the Black Spanish, the White variety is far less\r\nstriking in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe ANDALUSIAN are so called from having been brought from the Spanish\r\nprovince of Andalusia. This breed is of a bluish grey, sometimes\r\nslightly laced with a darker shade, but having the neck hackles and tail\r\nfeathers of a glossy black, with red face and white ears. The chickens\r\nare very hardy, and feather well, and earlier than the Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe MINORCA is so called from having been imported from that island, and\r\nis a larger and more compactly-formed breed, resembling the Spanish in\r\nits general characteristics; black, with metallic lustre, but with red\r\nface, and having only the ear-lobes white; showing even a larger comb,\r\nand with shorter legs. They are better as table fowls than the Spanish,\r\nbut the Andalusian are superior to either. The Minorca is the best layer\r\nof all the Spanish breeds, its chickens are tolerably hardy, and it is\r\naltogether far superior to the White-faced breed.\r\n\r\nANCONA is a provincial term applied to black and white mottled, or\r\n\"cuckoo,\" which on all other points resemble Minorcas, but are smaller.\r\n\r\nThe \"Black Rot,\" to which Spanish fowls are subject, is a blackening of\r\nthe comb, swelling of the legs and feet, and general wasting of the\r\nsystem; and can only be cured in the earlier stages by frequent purgings\r\nwith castor oil, combined with warm nourishing food, and strong ale, or\r\nother stimulants, given freely. They are also subject to a peculiar kind\r\nof swelled face, which first appears like a small knob under the skin,\r\nand increases till it has covered one side of the face. It is considered\r\nto be incurable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nHAMBURGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis breed is medium-sized, and should have a brilliant red,\r\nfinely-serrated rose-comb, terminating in a spike at the back, taper\r\nblue legs, ample tail, exact markings, a well-developed white deaf-ear,\r\nand a quick, spirited bearing. They are classed in three varieties, the\r\nPencilled, Spangled, and Black varieties, with the sub-varieties of Gold\r\nand Silver in the two former.\r\n\r\nThe Pencilled Hamburg is of two ground colours, gold and silver, that\r\nis, of a brown yellow or white, and very minutely marked. The hens of\r\nboth colours should have the body clearly pencilled across with several\r\nbars of black. The hackle in both sexes should be free from dark marks.\r\nIn the Golden-pencilled variety the cock should be of one uniform red\r\nall over his body without any pencilling whatever, and his tail copper\r\ncolour; but many first-class birds have pure black tails and the sickle\r\nfeathers should be shaded with a rich bronze or copper. In the\r\nSilver-pencilled variety the cock is often nearly white, with yellowish\r\nwing-coverts, and a brown or chestnut patch on the flight feathers of\r\nhis wing. The tail should be black and the sickle feathers tinged with a\r\nreddish white.\r\n\r\nThe Speckled or Spangled Hamburg, also called Pheasant Fowl, from the\r\nfalse idea that the pheasant was one of its parents, is of two kinds,\r\nthe Golden-speckled and Silver-speckled, according to their ground\r\ncolour, the marking taking the form of a spot upon each feather. They\r\nhave very full double and firmly fixed combs, the point at the end\r\nturning upwards, a dark rim round the eyes, blue legs, and mixed hackle.\r\nThey were also called Moss Fowls, and Mooneys, the latter probably\r\nbecause the end of every feather should have a black rim on the yellow\r\nor white ground. In the Golden-spangled some judges prefer cocks with a\r\npure black breast, but others desire them spangled.\r\n\r\n\"One chief cause of discussion,\" says Miss Watts, \"relating to the\r\nHamburg, regarded the markings on the cocks. The Yorkshire breed, which\r\nhad been a favourite in that county for many years, produced henny\r\ncocks--_i.e._ cocks with plumage resembling that of a hen. The feathers\r\nof the hackle were not narrow and elongated like those of cocks\r\ngenerally, but were short and rounded like those of the hen; the\r\nsaddle-feathers were the same, and the tail, instead of being graced\r\nwith fine flowing sickle feathers, was merely square like that of a hen.\r\nThe Lancashire Mooneys, on the contrary, produce cocks with as fine\r\nflowing plumage as need grace any chanticleer in the land, and\r\ntails with sickle-feathers twenty-two inches long, fine flowing\r\nsaddle-feathers, and abundant hackle. The hen-tail cocks had the\r\nmarkings, as well as the form, of the hen; the long feathers of the\r\nothers cannot, from their form, have these markings. On this question\r\nparty-spirit ran high: York and Lancaster, Cavalier and Roundhead, were\r\nsmall discussions compared with it; but the hen-cocks were beaten, and\r\nwe now seldom hear of them. A mixture of the two breeds has been tried;\r\nbut by it valuable qualities and purity of race have been sacrificed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Black Hamburg is of a beautiful black with a metallic lustre, and is\r\na noble-looking bird, the cocks often weighing seven pounds. There is\r\nlittle doubt that it was produced by crossing with the Spanish, which\r\nblood shows itself in the white face, which is often half apparent, and\r\nin the darker legs. But it is well established as a distinct variety,\r\nand good birds breed true to colour and points. The cocks' combs are\r\nlarger, and the hens' legs shorter, than the other varieties.\r\n\r\nBolton Bays and Greys, Chitteprats, Turkish, and Creoles or Corals,\r\nPencilled Dutch fowls, and Dutch every-day layers, are but incorrect\r\nnames for the Hamburgs, with which they are identical.\r\n\r\nThe Hamburgs do not attain to their full beauty until three years old.\r\n\"As a general rule,\" says Mr. Baily, \"no true bred Hamburg fowl has\r\ntop-knot, single comb, white legs, any approach to feather on the legs,\r\nwhite tail, or spotted hackle.\" The white ear-lobe being so\r\ncharacteristic a feature in all the Hamburgs, becomes most important in\r\njudging their merits. Weight is not considered, but still the Pencilled\r\ncock should not weigh less than four and a half pounds, nor the hen than\r\nthree and a half; and the Spangled cock five pounds and the hen four.\r\n\r\nThe Hamburgs are most prolific layers naturally, without\r\nover-stimulating feeding, surpassing all others in the number of their\r\neggs, and deserve their popular name of \"everlasting layers.\" Their eggs\r\nare white, and do not weigh more than 1-1/2 ounce to 1-3/4 ounce each;\r\nand the hens are known to average 240 eggs yearly. Not being large\r\neaters, they are very profitable fowls to keep. The eggs of the\r\nGolden-spangled are the largest, and it is the hardiest variety, but the\r\nPencilled lay more. The Black variety produces large eggs, and lays a\r\ngreater number than any known breed.\r\n\r\nThey very seldom show any desire to sit except when they have a free\r\nwoodland range, for even if free it must be wild to induce any desire to\r\nperpetuate the species, and they never sit if confined to a yard. The\r\nchickens should not be hatched earlier than May, but in the South of\r\nEngland they will do very well if hatched by a Cochin-China hen at the\r\nbeginning of March. They are small birds for table, but of excellent\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nHamburgs do not bear confinement well, and will not thrive without a\r\ngood run; a grass field is the best. Being small and light, even a\r\nten-feet fence will not keep them within a small run. They may indeed be\r\nkept in a shed, but the number must be very few in proportion to its\r\nsize, and they must be kept dry and scrupulously clean. They\r\nare excellent guards in the country, for if disturbed in their\r\nroosting-place they will make a great noise. The breed has improved in\r\nthis country, and British bred fowls are much stronger than the imported\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White-crested Black. Golden and Silver-spangled.\r\n\r\nPOLISH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nPOLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis breed might with good reason be divided into more families, but it\r\nis usual to rank as Polands all fowls with their chief distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic, a full, large, round, compact tuft on the head. The\r\nbreed \"is quite unknown in Poland, and takes its name,\" says Mr.\r\nDickson, \"from some resemblance having been fancied between its tufted\r\ncrest and the square-spreading crown of the feathered caps worn by the\r\nPolish soldiers.\" It is much esteemed in Egypt, and equally abundant at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, where their legs are feathered. Some travellers\r\nassert that the Mexican poultry are crested, and that what are called\r\nPoland fowls are natives of either Mexico or South America; but others\r\nbelieve that they are natives of the East, and that they, as well as all\r\nthe other fowls on the Continent of America, have been introduced from\r\nthe Old World.\r\n\r\nThe Golden-spangled and Silver-spangled are the most beautiful\r\nvarieties, the first being of a gold colour and the second white, both\r\nspangled with black. The more uniform the colour of the tuft is with\r\nthat of the bird, the higher it is valued.\r\n\r\nThe Black Poland is of a deep velvety black; has a large, white, round\r\ntuft, and should not have a comb, but many have a little comb in the\r\nform of two small points before the tuft. The tuft to be perfect should\r\nbe entirely white, but it is rare to meet with one without a slight\r\nbordering of black, or partly black, feathers round the front.\r\n\r\nThere are also Yellow, laced with white, Buff or Chamois, spangled with\r\nwhite, Blue, Grey, Black, and White mottled. All the sub-varieties\r\nshould be of medium size, neat compact form, plump, full-breasted, and\r\nhave lead-coloured legs and ample tails.\r\n\r\nThe top-knot of the cock should be composed of straight feathers,\r\ngrowing from the centre of the crown, and falling over outside, but not\r\nso much as to intercept the sight, and form a circular crest. That of\r\nthe hen should be formed of feathers growing out and turning in at the\r\nextremity, so as to resemble a cauliflower, and it should be even, firm,\r\nand as nearly round as possible. Large, uneven top-knots composed of\r\nloose feathers do not equal smaller but firm and well-shaped crests. The\r\nwhite ear-lobe is essential in all the varieties.\r\n\r\n\"Beards\" in Polands were formerly not admired. Among the early birds\r\nbrought from the continent, not one in a hundred was bearded, and those\r\nthat were so were often rejected, and it was a question of dispute\r\nwhether the pure bird should have them or not. Bearded birds at shows\r\nwere the exceptions, but an unbearded pen of Polands is now seldom or\r\never seen.\r\n\r\nThere was formerly a breed of White, with black top-knots, but that is\r\nlost, although it seems to have been not only the most ornamental, but\r\nthe largest and most valuable of all the Polish varieties. The last\r\nspecimen known was seen by Mr. Brent at St. Omer in 1854, and it is\r\npossible that the breed may still exist in France or Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe SERAI TA-OOK, or FOWL OF THE SULTAN, is the latest Polish fowl\r\nintroduced into this country. They were imported in 1854 by Miss Watts,\r\nwho says: \"With regard to the name, Serai is the name of the Sultan's\r\npalace; Tae-ook is Turkish for fowl; the simplest translation of this is,\r\nSultan's fowls, or fowls of the Sultan; a name which has the double\r\nadvantage of being the nearest to be found to that by which they have\r\nbeen known in their own country, and of designating the country from\r\nwhich they came. In general habits they are brisk and happy-tempered,\r\nbut not kept in as easily as Cochin-Chinas. They are very good layers;\r\ntheir eggs are large and white; they are non-sitters, and small eaters.\r\nA grass run with them will remain green long after the crop would have\r\nbeen cleared by either Brahmas or Cochins, and with scattered food they\r\nsoon become satisfied and walk away. They are the size of our English\r\nPoland fowls. Their plumage is white and flowing; they have a full-sized\r\ncompact Poland tuft on the head, are muffed, have a good flowing tail,\r\nshort well-feathered legs, and five toes upon each foot. The comb is\r\nmerely two little points, and the wattles very small. We have never seen\r\nfowls more fully decorated--full tail, abundant furnishing, in hackle\r\nalmost touching the ground, boots, vulture-hocks, beards, whiskers, and\r\nfull round Poland crests. Their colour is pure white.\"\r\n\r\nThey are prolific layers during spring and summer. Their eggs are white,\r\nand weigh from 2 ounces to 2-1/4 ounces each, the Spangled varieties\r\nproducing the largest. They rarely sit, and generally leave their eggs\r\nafter five or six days, and are not good mothers. The chickens require\r\ngreat care for six weeks. They should never be hatched by heavy hens, as\r\nthe prominence in the skull which supports the top-knot is never\r\ncompletely covered with bone, and very sensible to injury. Like the Game\r\nbreed they improve in feather for several years. Polands never thrive on\r\na wet or cold soil, and are more affected by bad weather than any other\r\nbreed; the top-knots being very liable to be saturated with wet.\r\nThey are easily fattened, and their flesh is white, juicy, and\r\nrich-flavoured, but they are not sufficiently large for the market.\r\n\r\nMr. Hewitt cautions breeders against attempting to seize birds suddenly,\r\nas the crest obscures their sight, and, being taken by surprise, they\r\nare frequently so frightened as to die in the hand. They should,\r\ntherefore, always be spoken to, or their attention otherwise attracted\r\nbefore being touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nBantams.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this breed one kind is Game, and resembles the Game fowl, except in\r\nsize; another is feathered to the very toes, the feathers on the tarsi,\r\nor beam of the leg, being long and stiff, and often brushing the ground.\r\nThey are peculiarly fancy fowls. There are several varieties, the White,\r\nBlack, Nankin, Partridge, Booted or Feather-legged, Game, and the\r\nGolden-laced and Silver-laced, or Sebright Bantam. All should be very\r\nsmall, varying from fourteen to twenty ounces in the hen, and from\r\nsixteen to twenty-four in the cock. The head should be narrow; beak\r\ncurved; forehead rounded; eyes bright; back short; body round and full;\r\nbreast very prominent; legs short and clean, except in the Booted\r\nvariety; wings depressed; and the carriage unusually erect, the back of\r\nthe neck and the tail feathers almost touching; and the whole bearing\r\ngraceful, bold, and proud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Black. Sebright's Gold and Silver-laced. White. Game.\r\n\r\nBANTAMS.]\r\n\r\n\"The Javanese jungle-fowl\" (_Gallus Bankiva_), says Mr. W. C. L. Martin,\r\n\"the Ayam-utan of the Malays, is a native of Java; but either a variety\r\nor a distinct species of larger size, yet very similar in colouring, is\r\nfound in continental India. The Javanese, or Bankiva jungle-fowl, is\r\nabout the size of an ordinary Bantam, and in plumage resembles the\r\nblack-breasted red Game-bird of our country, with, a steel-blue mark\r\nacross the wings. The comb is high, its edge is deeply serrated, and the\r\nwattles are rather large. The hackle feathers of the neck and rump are\r\nlong and of a glossy golden orange; the shoulders are chestnut red, the\r\ngreater wing-coverts deep steel-blue, the quill feathers brownish black,\r\nedged with pale, reddish yellow, or sandy red. The tail is of a black\r\ncolour, with metallic reflections of green and blue. The under parts are\r\nblack the naked space round the eyes, the comb, and wattles are\r\nscarlet. The hen closely resembles a brown hen of the Game breed, except\r\nin being very much smaller. That this bird, or its continental ally, is\r\none of the sources--perhaps the main source--of our domestic race,\r\ncannot be doubted. It inter-breeds freely with our common poultry, and\r\nthe progeny is fertile. Most beautiful cross-breeds between the Bankiva\r\njungle-fowl and Bantam may be seen in the gardens of the Zoological\r\nSociety.\"\r\n\r\n\"That the Bankiva jungle-fowl of Java, or its larger continental\r\nvariety, if it be not a distinct species (and of which Sir W. Jardine\r\nstates that he has seen several specimens), is one of the sources of our\r\ndomestic breeds, cannot, we think, be for a moment doubted. It would be\r\ndifficult to discover any difference between a clean-limbed,\r\nblack-breasted red Bantam-cock, and a cock Bankiva jungle-fowl. Indeed,\r\nthe very term Bantam goes far to prove their specific identity. Bantam\r\nis a town or city at the bottom of a bay on the northern coast of Java;\r\nit was first visited by the Portuguese in 1511, at which time a great\r\ntrade was carried on by the town with Arabia, Hindostan, and China,\r\nchiefly in pepper. Subsequently it fell into the hands of the Dutch, and\r\nwas at one time the great rendezvous for European shipping. It is now a\r\nplace of comparative insignificance. From this it would seem that the\r\njungle-fowls domesticated and sold to the Europeans at Bantam continued\r\nto be designated by the name of the place where they were obtained, and\r\nin process of time the name was appropriated to all our dwarfish\r\nbreeds.\"\r\n\r\nGame Bantams are exact miniatures of real Game fowls, in Black-breasted\r\nred, Duck-wing, and other varieties. The cocks must not have the strut\r\nof the Bantam, but the bold, martial bearing of the Game cock. Their\r\nwings should be carried closely, and their feathers be hard and close.\r\nThe Duck-wing cock's lower wing-coverts should be marked with blue,\r\nforming a bar across each wing.\r\n\r\nThe SEBRIGHT, or GOLD AND SILVER-LACED BANTAM, is a breed with clean\r\nlegs, and of most elegantly spangled plumage, which was bred and has\r\nbeen brought to great perfection by Sir John Sebright, after whom they\r\nare named. The attitude of the cock is singularly bold and proud, the\r\nhead being often thrown so much back as to meet the tail feathers, which\r\nare simple like those of a hen, the ordinary sickle-like feathers being\r\nabbreviated and broad. The Gold-laced Sebright Bantams should have\r\ngolden brownish-yellow plumage, each feather being bordered with a\r\nlacing of black; the tail square like that of the hen, without sickle\r\nfeathers, and carried well over the back, each feather being tipped with\r\nblack, a rose-comb pointed at the back, the wings drooping to the\r\nground, neither saddle nor neck hackles, clean lead-coloured legs and\r\nfeet, and white ear-lobes; and the hen should correspond exactly with\r\nhim, but be much smaller. The Silver-laced birds have exactly the same\r\npoints except in the ground feathering, which should be silvery, and the\r\nnearer the shade approaches to white the more beautiful will be the\r\nbird. Their carriage should resemble that of a good Fantail pigeon.\r\n\r\nThe BLACK BANTAMS should be uniform in colour, with well-developed white\r\near-lobes, rose-combs, full hackles, sickled and flowing tail, and deep\r\nslate-coloured legs. The WHITE BANTAMS should have white legs and beak.\r\nBoth should be of tiny size.\r\n\r\nThe NANKIN, or COMMON YELLOW BANTAM, is probably the nearest approach to\r\nthe original type of the family--the \"Bankiva fowl.\" The cock \"has a\r\nlarge proportion of red and dark chestnut on the body, with a full black\r\ntail; while the hen is a pale orange yellow, with a tail tipped with\r\nblack, and the hackle lightly pencilled with the same colour, and clean\r\nlegs. Combs vary, but the rose is decidedly preferable. True-bred\r\nspecimens of these birds being by no means common, considerable\r\ndeviations from the above description may consequently be expected in\r\nbirds passing under this appellation.\"\r\n\r\nThe BOOTED BANTAMS have their legs plumed to the toes, not on one side\r\nonly like Cochin-Chinas, but completely on both, with stiff, long\r\nfeathers, which brush the ground. The most beautiful specimens are of a\r\npure white. \"Feathered-legged Bantams,\" says Mr. Baily, \"may be of any\r\ncolour; the old-fashioned birds were very small, falcon-hocked, and\r\nfeathered, with long quill feathers to the extremity of the toe. Many of\r\nthem were bearded. They are now very scarce; indeed, till exhibitions\r\nbrought them again into notice, these beautiful specimens of their tribe\r\nwere all neglected and fast passing away. Nothing but the Sebright was\r\ncultivated; but now we bid fair to revive the pets of our ancestors in\r\nall their beauty.\"\r\n\r\nThe PEKIN, or COCHIN BANTAMS, were taken from the Summer Palace at Pekin\r\nduring the Chinese war, and brought to this country. They exactly\r\nresemble the Buff Cochins in all respects except size. They are very\r\ntame.\r\n\r\nThe JAPANESE BANTAM is a recent importation, and differs from most of\r\nthe other varieties in having a very large single comb. It has very\r\nshort well-feathered legs, and the colour varies. Some are quite white,\r\nsome have pure white bodies, with glossy, jet-black tails, others are\r\nmottled and buff. They throw the tail up and the head back till they\r\nnearly meet, as in the Fantailed pigeon. They are said to be the\r\nconstant companions of man in their native country, and have a droll and\r\ngood-natured expression.\r\n\r\nAll the Bantam cocks are very pugnacious, and though the hens are good\r\nmothers to their own chickens, they will attack any stranger with fury.\r\nThey are good layers of small but exquisitely-flavoured eggs. But no\r\nbreed produces so great a proportion of unfertile eggs. June is the best\r\nmonth for hatching, as the chickens are delicate. They feather more\r\nquickly than most breeds, and are apt to die at that period through the\r\ngreat drain upon the system in producing feathers. When fully feathered\r\nthey are quite hardy. The hens are excellent mothers. The chickens\r\nrequire a little more animal food than other fowls, and extra attention\r\nfor a week or two in keeping them dry. Bantams are very useful in a\r\ngarden, eating many slugs and insects, and doing little damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nFRENCH AND VARIOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French breeds are remarkable for great weight and excellent quality\r\nof flesh, with a very small proportion of bones and offal; their\r\nbreeders having paid great attention to those important, substantial,\r\nand commercial points instead of devoting almost exclusive attention to\r\ncolour and other fancy points as we have done. As a rule they are all\r\nnon-sitters, or sit but rarely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Houdans. La Fleche, cock. Creve-Coeur, hen.\r\n\r\nFRENCH.]\r\n\r\nThe CREVE-COEUR has been known the longest and most generally. This\r\nbreed is said to derive its name from a village so called in Normandy,\r\nwhence its origin can be distinctly traced; but others fancifully say,\r\nfrom the resemblance of its peculiar comb to a broken heart. It is\r\nscarce, and pure-bred birds are difficult to procure. The Creve-Coeur\r\nis a fine large bird, black in plumage, or nearly so, with short, clean\r\nblack legs, square body, deep chest, and a large and extraordinary crest\r\nor comb, which is thus described by M. Jacque: \"Various, but always\r\nforming two horns, sometimes parallel, straight, and fleshy; sometimes\r\njoined at the base, slightly notched, pointed, and separating at their\r\nextremities; sometimes adding to this latter description interior\r\nramifications like the horns of a young stag. The comb, shaped like\r\nhorns, gives the Creve-Coeur the appearance of a devil.\" It is\r\nbearded, and has a top-knot or crest behind the comb. They are very\r\nquiet, walk slowly, scratch but little, do not fly, are very tame,\r\nramble but little, and prefer seeking their food on the dunghill in the\r\npoultry-yard to wandering afar off. They are the most contented of all\r\nbreeds in confinement, and will thrive in a limited space. They are\r\ntame, tractable fowls, but inclined to roup and similar diseases in our\r\nclimate, and therefore prosper most on a dry, light soil, and can\r\nscarcely have too much sun. They are excellent layers of very large\r\nwhite eggs.\r\n\r\nThe chickens grow so fast, and are so inclined to fatten, that they may\r\nbe put up at from ten to twelve weeks of age, and well fattened in\r\nfifteen days. The Creve-Coeur is a splendid table bird, both for the\r\nquantity and quality of its flesh. The hen is heavy in proportion to the\r\ncock, weighing eight and a half pounds against his nine and a half, and\r\nthe pullets always outweigh the cockerels.\r\n\r\nLA FLECHE is thus described by M. Jacque: \"A strong, firm body, well\r\nplaced on its legs, and long muscular feet, appearing less than it\r\nreally is, because the feathers are close; every muscular part well\r\ndeveloped; black plumage. The La Fleche is the tallest of all French\r\ncocks; it has many points of resemblance with the Spanish, from which I\r\nbelieve it to be descended by crossing with the Creve-Coeur. Others\r\nbelieve that it is connected with the Breda, which it does, in fact,\r\nresemble, in some particulars. It has white, loose, and transparent\r\nskin; short, juicy, and delicate flesh, which puts on fat easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"The comb is transversal, double, forming two horns bending forward,\r\nunited at their base, divided at their summits, sometimes even and\r\npointed, sometimes having ramifications on the inner sides. A little\r\ndouble 'combling' protrudes from the upper part of the nostrils, and\r\nalthough hardly as large as a pea, this combling, which surmounts the\r\nsort of rising formed by the protrusion of the nostrils, contributes to\r\nthe singular aspect of the head. This measured prominence of the comb\r\nseems to add to the characteristic depression of the beak, and gives the\r\nbird a likeness to a rhinoceros.\" The plumage is jet black, with a very\r\nrich metallic lustre; large ear-lobe of pure white; bright red face,\r\nunusually free from feathers; and bright lead-coloured legs, with hard,\r\nfirm scales. They are very handsome, showy, large, and lively birds,\r\nmore inclined to wander than the Creve-Coeur, and hardier when full\r\ngrown; but their chickens are even more delicate in wet weather, and\r\nshould not be hatched before May. They are easily reared, and grow\r\nquickly. They are excellent layers of very large white eggs, but do not\r\nlay well in winter, unless under very favourable circumstances, and\r\nresemble the Spanish in the size and number of their eggs, and the time\r\nand duration of laying. Their flesh is excellent, juicy, and resembles\r\nthat of the Game fowl, and the skin white and transparent, but the legs\r\nare dark. This breed is larger and has more style than the Creve-Coeur,\r\nand is better adapted to our climate; but the fowls lack constitution,\r\nparticularly the cocks, and are very liable to leg weakness and disease\r\nof the knee-joint, and when they get out of condition seldom recover.\r\nThey are found in the north of France, but are not common even there.\r\n\r\nThe HOUDAN has the size, deep compact body, short legs, and fifth toe of\r\nthe Dorking. They are generally white, some having black spots as large\r\nas a shilling, are bearded, and should have good top-knots of black and\r\nwhite feathers, falling backwards like a lark's crest; and the\r\nremarkable comb is thus described by M. Jacque: \"Triple, transversal in\r\nthe direction of the beak, composed of two flattened spikes, of long and\r\nrectangular form, opening from right to left, like two leaves of a book;\r\nthick, fleshy, and variegated at the edges. A third spike grows between\r\nthese two, having somewhat the shape of an irregular strawberry, and the\r\nsize of a long nut. Another, quite detached from the others, about the\r\nsize of a pea, should show between the nostrils, above the beak.\"\r\n\r\nMr. F. H. Schroeder, of the National Poultry Company, considered that\r\nthis surpassed all the French breeds, combining the size, shape, and\r\nquality of flesh of the Dorking with earlier maturity; prolific laying\r\nof good-sized eggs, which are nearly always fertile, and on this point\r\nthe opposite of the Dorking; and early and rapid feathering in the\r\nchickens, which are, notwithstanding, hardier than any breeds except the\r\nCochin and Brahma. They are very hardy, never sick, and will thrive in a\r\nsmall space. They are smaller than the Creve-Coeur or La Fleche, but\r\nwell shaped and plump; and for combining size and quality of flesh with\r\nquantity and size of eggs nothing can surpass them.\r\n\r\nSCOTCH DUMPIES, GO LAIGHS, BAKIES, or CREEPERS, are almost extinct; but\r\nthey are profitable fowls, and ought to be more common, as they are very\r\nhardy, productive layers of fine large eggs, and their flesh is white\r\nand of excellent quality. They should have large, heavy bodies; short,\r\nwhite, clean legs, not above an inch and a half or two inches in length.\r\nThe plumage is a mixture of black or brown, and white. They are good\r\nlayers of fine large eggs. They cannot be surpassed as sitters and\r\nmothers, and are much valued by gamekeepers for hatching the eggs of\r\npheasants. The cocks should weigh six or seven and the hen five or six\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nThe SILKY fowl is so called from its plumage, which is snowy white,\r\nbeing all discomposed and loose, and of a silky appearance, resembling\r\nspun glass. The comb and wattles are purple; the bones and the\r\nperiosteum, or membrane covering the bones, black, and the skin blue or\r\npurple; but the flesh, however, is white and tender, and superior to\r\nthat of most breeds. It is a good layer of small, round, and excellent\r\neggs. The cock generally weighs less than three, and the hen less than\r\ntwo, pounds. It comes from Japan and China, and generally thrives in our\r\nclimate. The chickens are easily reared if not hatched before April nor\r\nlater than June. They are capital foster mothers for partridges, and\r\nother small and tender game.\r\n\r\nThe RUMPKIN, or RUMPLESS fowl, a Persian breed, not only lacks the\r\ntail-feathers but the tail itself. It is hardy, of moderate size, and\r\nvaries in colour, but is generally black or brown, and from the absence\r\nof tail appears rounder than other fowls. The hens are good layers, but\r\nthe eggs are often unfertile. They are good sitters and mothers, and the\r\nflesh is of fair quality.\r\n\r\nThe FRIESLAND, so named from confounding the term \"frizzled\" with\r\nFriesland, is remarkable from having all the feathers, except those of\r\nthe wings and tail, frizzled, or curled up the wrong way. It is small,\r\nvery delicate, and a shower drenches it to the skin.\r\n\r\nBARN-DOOR fowl are a mongrel race, compounded by chance, usually of the\r\nGame, Dorking, and Polish breeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTURKEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurkeys are not considered profitable except on light, dry soils, which\r\nis said to be the cause of their success in Norfolk. They prosper,\r\nhowever, in Ireland; but although the air there is moist, the soil is\r\ndry, except in the boggy districts. Miss Watts believes that \"any place\r\nin which turkeys are properly reared and fed may compete with Norfolk.\r\nVery fine birds may be seen in Surrey, and other places near London.\"\r\nThe general opinion of the best judges is, that they can barely be made\r\nto repay the cost of their food, which is doubtless owing to the usual\r\ngreat mortality among the chicks, which loss outbalances all profit; but\r\nothers make them yield a fair profit, simply because, from good\r\nsituation and judicious management, they rear all, or nearly all, the\r\nchicks. A single brood may be reared with ease on a small farm or\r\nprivate establishment without much extra expense, where sufficient\r\nattention can be devoted to them; but to make them profitable they\r\nshould be bred on a large scale, and receive exclusive attention. They\r\nshould have a large shed or house, with a boarded floor, to themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Turkey and Guinea-fowls.]\r\n\r\nTurkeys must have space, for they are birds of rambling habits, and only\r\nfitted for the farmyard, or extensive runs, delighting to wander in the\r\nfields in quest of insects, on which, with green herbage, berries,\r\nbeech-mast, and various seeds, they greedily feed. The troop will ramble\r\nabout all day, returning to roost in the evening, when they should have\r\na good supply of grain; and another should be given in the morning,\r\nwhich will not only induce them to return home regularly every night,\r\nbut keep them in good store condition, so that they can at any time be\r\nspeedily fattened. Peas, vetches, tares, and most sorts of pulse, are\r\nalmost poisonous to them. Their feeding-place must be separate from\r\nthe other poultry, or they will gobble up more than their share. Turkeys\r\nwill rarely roost in a fowl-house, and should have a very high open\r\nshed, the perches being placed as high as possible. They are extremely\r\nhardy, roosting, if allowed, on the highest trees in the severest\r\nweather. But this should be prevented, as their feet are apt to become\r\nfrost-bitten in severe weather. The chickens are as delicate. Wet is\r\nfatal to them, and the very slightest shower even in warm weather will\r\nfrequently destroy half a brood.\r\n\r\nThe breeding birds should be carefully selected, any malformation almost\r\ninvariably proving itself hereditary. The cock is at maturity when a\r\nyear old, but not in his prime till he has attained his third year, and\r\nis entering upon his fourth, and he continues in vigour for three or\r\nfour years more. He should be vigorous, broad-breasted, clean-legged,\r\nwith ample wings, well-developed tail, bright eyes, and the carunculated\r\nskin of the neck full and rapid in its changes of colour. The largest\r\npossible hen should be chosen, the size of the brood depending far more\r\nupon the female than the male. One visit to the male is sufficient to\r\nrender all the eggs fertile, and the number of hens may be unlimited,\r\nbut to obtain fine birds, twelve or fifteen hens to one cock is the best\r\nproportion. The hen breeds in the spring following that in which she was\r\nhatched, but is not in her prime till two or three years old, and\r\ncontinues for two or three years in full vigour.\r\n\r\nThe hen generally commences laying about the middle of March, but\r\nsometimes earlier. When from her uttering a peculiar cry and prying\r\nabout in quest of a secret spot for sitting, it is evident that she is\r\nready to lay, she should be confined in the shed, barn, or other place\r\nwhere the nest has been prepared for her, and let out when she has laid\r\nan egg. The nest should be made of straw and dried leaves, in a large\r\nwicker basket, in a quiet secluded place, and an egg or nest-egg of\r\nchalk should be placed in it to induce her to adopt it. Turkeys like to\r\nchoose their own laying-places, and keep to them though their eggs are\r\nremoved daily, provided a nest-egg is left there. They will wander to a\r\ndistance in search of a secluded spot for laying, and pay their visits\r\nto the nest so cleverly that sometimes they keep it a secret and hatch a\r\nbrood there, which, however, does not generally prove a strong or large\r\none as in the case of ordinary fowls. When a hen has chosen a safe,\r\nquiet, and sheltered place for her nest, it is best to give her more\r\neggs when she shows a desire to sit, and let her stay there. The hen\r\ngenerally lays from fifteen to twenty eggs, sometimes fewer and often\r\nmany more. As soon as seven are produced, they should be placed under a\r\ngood common hen, a Cochin is the best, and the remainder can be put\r\nunder her when she wants to sit. The best hatching period is from the\r\nend of March to May, and none should be hatched later than June. The\r\nbroody hens may be placed on their eggs in any quiet place, as they are\r\npatient, constant sitters, and will not leave their eggs wherever they\r\nmay be put. A hen may be allowed from nine to fifteen eggs, according to\r\nher size. During the time the hen is sitting she requires constant\r\nattention. She must occasionally be taken off the nest to feed, and\r\nregularly supplied with fresh water; otherwise she will continue to sit\r\nwithout leaving for food, till completely exhausted. In general, do not\r\nlet the cock go near the sitting hen, or he will destroy the eggs or\r\nchicks; but some behave well, and may be left at large with safety. She\r\nshould not be disturbed or visited by any one but the person she is\r\naccustomed to be fed by, and the eggs should not be touched\r\nunnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThe chickens break the shell from the twenty-sixth to the twenty-ninth\r\nday, but sometimes as late as the thirty-first. Let them remain in the\r\nnest for twenty-four hours, but remove the shells, and next morning\r\nplace the hen under a roomy coop or crate, on boards, in a warm\r\nouthouse. Keep her and her brood cooped up for two months, moving the\r\ncoop every fine day into a dry grass field, but keep them in an outhouse\r\nin cold or wet weather. The chicks having a great tendency to diarrhoea,\r\nthe very best food for the first week is hard-boiled eggs, chopped\r\nsmall, mixed with minced dandelion, and when that cannot be had, with\r\nboiled nettles. They may then have boiled egg, bread-crumbs, and\r\nbarley-meal for a fortnight, when the egg may be replaced by boiled\r\npotato, and small grain may soon be added. Do not force them to eat, but\r\ngive them a little food on the tip of your finger, and they will soon\r\nlearn to pick it out of the trough. A little hempseed, suet, onion-tops,\r\ngreen mustard, and nettle-tops, chopped very fine, should be mixed with\r\ntheir food. Curds are excellent food, and easily prepared by mixing\r\npowdered alum with milk slightly warmed, in the proportion of one\r\nteaspoonful of alum to four quarts of milk, and, when curdled,\r\nseparating the curds from the whey. They should be squeezed very dry,\r\nand must always be given in a soft state. Water should be given but\r\nsparingly, and never allowed to stand by them, but when they have had\r\nsufficient it should be taken or thrown away. The water must be put in\r\npans so contrived or placed that they cannot wet themselves. (_See_ page\r\n38.) Fresh milk is apt to disagree with the young chicks, and is not\r\nnecessary. If a chick shows weakness, or has taken cold, give it some\r\ncarraway seeds.\r\n\r\nIn their wild state the turkey rears only one brood in a season, and it\r\nis not advisable to induce the domesticated bird by any expedients to\r\nhatch a second, for it would be not only detrimental to her, but the\r\nbrood would be hatched late in the season, and very difficult to rear,\r\nwhile those reared would not be strong, healthy birds.\r\n\r\nThe coop should be like that used for common fowls, but two feet broad,\r\nand higher, being about three feet high in front and one foot at the\r\nback; this greater slant of the roof being made in order to confine her\r\nmovements, as otherwise she would move about too much, and trample upon\r\nher brood. When they have grown larger they must have a larger coop,\r\nmade of open bars wide enough apart for them to go in and out, but too\r\nclose to let in fowls to eat their delicate food, and the hen must be\r\nplaced under it with them. A large empty crate, such as is used to\r\ncontain crockery-ware, will make a good coop for large poults; but if\r\none cannot be had, a coop may be made of laths or rails, with the bars\r\nfour inches apart; it should be about five feet long, four feet broad,\r\nand three feet high.\r\n\r\nKeep her cooped for two months, moving the coop every fine, dry day into\r\na grass field, but on cold or wet days keep them in the outhouse. If she\r\nis allowed her liberty before they are well grown and strong, she will\r\nwander away with them through the long grass, hedges, and ditches, over\r\nhighway, common, and meadow, mile after mile, losing them on the road,\r\nand straying on with the greatest complacency, and perfectly satisfied\r\nso long as she has one or two following her, and never once turning her\r\nhead to see how her panting chicks are getting on, nor troubled when\r\nthey squat down tired out, and implore her plaintively to come back; and\r\nall this arises from sheer heedlessness, and not from want of affection,\r\nfor she will fight for her brood as valiantly as any pheasant will for\r\nhers. When full grown they should never be allowed to roam with her\r\nwhile there is heavy dew or white frost on the grass, but be kept in\r\ntill the fields and hedgerows are dry. They will pick up many seeds and\r\ninsects while wandering about in the fields with her, but must be fed by\r\nhand three or four times a day at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nThey cease to be chicks or chickens, and are called turkey-poults when\r\nthe male and female distinctive characteristics are fairly established,\r\nthe carunculated skin and comb of the cock being developed, which is\r\ncalled \"shooting the red,\" or \"putting out the red,\" and begins when\r\nthey are eight or ten weeks old. It is the most critical period of their\r\nlives--much more so than moulting, and during the process their food\r\nmust be increased in quantity, and made more nourishing by the addition\r\nof boiled egg-yolks, bread crumbled in ale, wheaten flour, bruised\r\nhempseed, and the like, and they must be well housed at night. When this\r\nprocess is completed they will be hardy, and able to take care of\r\nthemselves; but till they are fully fledged it will be advisable to keep\r\nthem from rain and cold, and not to try their hardness too suddenly.\r\n\r\nVegetables, as chopped nettles, turnip-tops, cabbage sprouts, onions,\r\ndocks, and the like, boiled down and well mixed with barley-meal,\r\noatmeal, or wheaten flour, and curds, if they can be afforded, form\r\nexcellent food for the young poults; also steamed potatoes, boiled\r\ncarrots, turnips, and the like. With this diet may be given buckwheat,\r\nbarley, oats, beans, and sunflower seeds.\r\n\r\nWhen they are old enough to be sent to the stubble and fields, they are\r\nplaced in charge of a boy or girl of from twelve to fifteen years old,\r\nwho can easily manage one hundred poults. They are driven with a long\r\nbean stick, and the duties of the turkey-herd is to keep the cocks from\r\nfighting, to lead them to every place where there are acorns,\r\nbeech-mast, corn, wild fruit, insects, or other food to be picked up. He\r\nmust not allow them to get fatigued with too long rambles, as they are\r\nnot fully grown, and must shelter them from the burning sun, and hasten\r\nthem home on the approach of rain. The best times for these rambles are\r\nfrom eight to ten in the morning, when the dew is off the grass, and\r\nfrom four till seven in the evening, before it begins to fall.\r\n\r\nTurkeys are crammed for the London markets. The process of fattening may\r\ncommence when they are six months old, as they require a longer time to\r\nbecome fit for the market than fowls. The large birds which are seen at\r\nChristmas are usually males of the preceding year, and about twenty\r\nmonths old. All experienced breeders repudiate \"cramming.\" To obtain\r\nfine birds the chickens must be fed abundantly from their birth until\r\nthey are sent to market, and while they are being fattened they should\r\nbe sent to the fields and stubble for a shorter time daily, and their\r\nfood must be increased in quantity and improved in quality. Early\r\nhatched, well fed young Norfolk cocks will frequently weigh twenty-three\r\npounds by Christmas of the same year, and two-year-old birds will\r\nsometimes attain to twenty pounds. When two or more years old they are\r\ncalled \"stags.\"\r\n\r\nThe domesticated turkey can scarcely be said to be divided into distinct\r\nbreeds like the common fowl, the several varieties being distinguished\r\nby colour only, but identical in their form and habits. They vary\r\nconsiderably in colour--some being of a bronzed black, others of a\r\ncoppery tint, of a delicate fawn colour, or buff, and some of pure\r\nwhite. The dark coloured birds are generally considered the most hardy,\r\nand are usually the largest. The chief varieties are the Cambridge,\r\nNorfolk, Irish, American, and French.\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge combines enormous size, a tendency to fatten speedily, and\r\nfirst-rate flavour. The tortoiseshell character of its plumage gives the\r\nadult birds a very prepossessing appearance around the homestead, and a\r\nstriking character in the exhibition room. The colours may vary from\r\npale to dark grey, with a deep metallic brown tint, and light legs. The\r\nlegs should be stout and long.\r\n\r\nThe Norfolk breed is more compact and smaller-boned, and produces a\r\nlarge quantity of meat of delicate whiteness and excellent quality. The\r\ncocks are almost as heavy as the Cambridge breed, but the hens are\r\nsmaller and more compact. The Norfolk should be jet, not blue black, and\r\nfree from any other colour, being uniform throughout, including the legs\r\nand feet.\r\n\r\nAll the birds in a pen must be uniform.\r\n\r\nThe American wild turkey has become naturalised in this country, but\r\nbeing of a very wandering disposition is best adapted to be kept in\r\nparks and on large tracts of wild land. It is slender in shape, but of\r\ngood size, with uniform metallic bronze plumage, the flight feathers\r\nbeing barred with white, and the tail alternately with white, rich dark\r\nbrown, and black, and with bright pink legs. The wattles are smaller\r\nthan in the other breeds, and of a bluish tinge. They are very hardy,\r\nbut more spiteful than others, and are said to be also more prolific.\r\nCrosses often take place in America between the wild and tame races, and\r\nare highly valued both for their appearance and for the table. Eggs of\r\nthe wild turkey have also often been taken from their nests, and hatched\r\nunder the domesticated hen. The flavour of the flesh of the American\r\nbreed is peculiar and exceedingly good, but they do not attain a large\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nGUINEA-FOWLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Guinea-fowl, Gallina, or Pintado (_Numida Meleagris_), is the true\r\nmeleagris of the ancients, a term generically applied by Belon,\r\nAldrovandus, and Gesner to the turkey, and now retained, although the\r\nerror is acknowledged, in order to prevent confusion. It is a native of\r\nAfrica, where it is extensively distributed. They associate in large\r\nflocks and frequent open glades, the borders of forests, and banks of\r\nrivers, which offer abundant supplies of grain, berries, and insects, in\r\nquest of which they wander during the day, and collect together at\r\nevening, and roost in clusters on the branches of trees or shrubs.\r\nSeveral other wild species are known, some of which are remarkable for\r\ntheir beauty; but the common Guinea-fowl is the only one domesticated in\r\nEurope. The Guinea-fowl is about twenty-two inches long, and from\r\nstanding high on its legs, and having loose, full plumage, appears to be\r\nlarger than it really is, for when plucked it does not weigh more than\r\nan ordinary Dorking. It is very plump and well-proportioned. The\r\nGuinea-fowl is not bred so much as the turkey in England or France, is\r\nvery rare in the northern parts of Europe, and in India is bred almost\r\nexclusively by Europeans, although it thrives as well there as in its\r\nnative country. It \"is turbulent and restless,\" says Mr. Dickson,\r\n\"continually moving from place to place, and domineering over the whole\r\npoultry-yard, boldly attacking even the fiercest turkey cock, and\r\nkeeping all in alarm by its petulant pugnacity\"; and the males, although\r\nwithout spurs, can inflict serious injury on other poultry with their\r\nshort, hard beaks. The Guinea-fowls make very little use of their wings,\r\nand if forced to take to flight, fly but a short distance, then alight,\r\nand trust to their rapid mode of running, and their dexterity in\r\nthreading the mazes of brushwood and dense herbage, for security. They\r\nare shy, wary, and alert.\r\n\r\nIt is not much kept, its habits being wandering, and requiring an\r\nextensive range, but as it picks up nearly all its food, and is very\r\nprolific, it may be made very profitable in certain localities. The\r\nwhole management of both the young and the old may be precisely the same\r\nas that of turkeys, in hatching, feeding, and fattening. This \"species,\"\r\nsays Mr. Dickson, \"differs from all other poultry, in its being\r\ndifficult to distinguish the cock from the hen, the chief difference\r\nbeing in the colour of the wattles, which are more of a red hue in the\r\ncock, and more tinged with blue in the hen. The cock has also a more\r\nstately strut.\"\r\n\r\nThey mate in pairs, and therefore an equal number of cocks and hens must\r\nbe kept, or the eggs will prove unfertile. To obtain stock, some of\r\ntheir eggs must be procured, and placed under a common hen; for if old\r\nbirds are bought, they will wander away for miles in search of their old\r\nhome, and never return. They should be fed regularly, and must always\r\nhave one meal at night, or they will scarcely ever roost at home. They\r\nwill not sleep in the fowl-house, but prefer roosting in the lower\r\nbranches of a tree, or on a thick bush, and retire early. They make a\r\npeculiar, harsh, querulous noise, which is oft-repeated, and not\r\nagreeable. The hens are prolific layers, beginning in May, and\r\ncontinuing during the whole summer. Their eggs are small, but of\r\nexcellent flavour, of a pale yellowish red, finely dotted with a darker\r\ntint, and remarkable for the hardness of the shell. The hen usually lays\r\non a dry bank, in secret places; and a hedgerow a quarter of a mile off\r\nis quite as likely to contain her nest as any situation nearer her home.\r\nShe is very shy, and, if the eggs are taken from her nest, will desert\r\nit, and find another; a few should, therefore, always be left, and it\r\nshould never be visited when she is in sight. But she often contrives to\r\nelude all watching, and hatch a brood, frequently at a late period,\r\nwhen the weather is too cold for the chickens. As the Guinea-fowl seldom\r\nshows much disposition to incubate if kept under restraint, and\r\nfrequently sits too late in the season to rear a brood in this country,\r\nit is a general practice to place her eggs under a common fowl--Game and\r\nBantams are the best for the purpose. About twenty of the earliest eggs\r\nshould be set in May. The Guinea-hen will hatch another brood when she\r\nfeels inclined. They sit for twenty-six to twenty-nine or thirty days.\r\nWhen she sits in due season she generally rears a large brood, twenty\r\nnot being an unusual number.\r\n\r\nThe chickens are very tender, and should not be hatched too early in\r\nspring, as a cold March wind is generally fatal to them. They must be\r\ntreated like those of the turkey, and as carefully. They should be fed\r\nalmost immediately, within six hours of being hatched, abundantly, and\r\noften; and they require more animal food than other chickens. Egg boiled\r\nhard, chopped very fine, and mixed with oatmeal, is the best food. They\r\nwill die if kept without food for three or four hours; and should have a\r\nconstant supply near them until they are allowed to have full liberty\r\nand forage for themselves. They will soon pick up insects, &c., and will\r\nkeep themselves in good condition with a little extra food. They are\r\nvery strong on their legs, and those hatched under common hens may be\r\nallowed to range with her at the end of six weeks, and be fed on the\r\nsame food and at the same times as other chickens.\r\n\r\nThe Guinea-fowl may be considered as somewhat intermediate between the\r\npheasant and turkey. After the pheasant season, young birds that have\r\nbeen hatched the same year are excellent substitutes for that fine game,\r\nand fetch a fair price. They should never be fattened, but have a good\r\nsupply of grain and meal for a week or two before being killed. The\r\nflesh of the young bird is very delicate, juicy, and well-flavoured, but\r\nthe old birds, even of the second year, are dry, tough, and tasteless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nDUCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDucks will not pay if all their food has to be bought, except it is\r\npurchased wholesale, and they are reared for town markets, for their\r\nappetites are voracious, and they do not graze like geese. They may be\r\nkept in a limited space, but more profitably and conveniently where they\r\nhave the run of a paddock, orchard, kitchen garden, flat common, green\r\nlane, or farmyard, with ditches and water. They will return at night,\r\nand come to the call of the feeder. Nothing comes amiss to them--green\r\nvegetables, especially when boiled, all kinds of meal made into\r\nporridge, all kinds of grain, bread, oatcake, the refuse and offal of\r\nthe kitchen, worms, slugs, snails, insects and their larvae, are devoured\r\neagerly. Where many fowls are kept, a few ducks may be added profitably,\r\nfor they may be fed very nearly on what the hens refuse.\r\n\r\nDucks require water to swim in, but \"it is a mistake,\" says Mr. Baily,\r\n\"to imagine that ducks require a great deal of water. They may be kept\r\nwhere there is but very little, and only want a pond or tank just deep\r\nenough to swim in. The early Aylesbury ducklings that realise such large\r\nprices in the London market have hardly ever had a swim; and in rearing\r\nducks, where size is a desideratum, they will grow faster and become\r\nlarger when kept in pens, farmyards, or in pastures, than where they are\r\nat and in the water all day.\" Where a large number of geese and ducks\r\nare kept, water on a sufficient scale, and easily accessible, should be\r\nin the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Toulouse Goose.\r\n\r\nRouen and Aylesbury Ducks.]\r\n\r\nDucks, being aquatic birds, do not require heated apartments, nor roosts\r\non which to perch during the night. They squat on the floors, which must\r\nbe dry and warm. They should, if possible, be kept in a house separate\r\nfrom the other poultry, and it should have a brick floor, so that it\r\ncan be easily washed. In winter the floor should be littered with a thin\r\nlayer of straw, rushes, or fern leaves, fresh every day. The\r\nhatching-houses should be separated from the lodging apartments, and\r\nprovided with boxes for the purpose of incubation and hatching.\r\n\r\nIn its wild state the duck pairs with a single mate: the domestic duck\r\nhas become polygamous, and five ducks may be allowed to one drake, but\r\nnot more than two or three ducks should be given to one drake if eggs\r\nare required for setting.\r\n\r\nDucks begin laying in January, and usually from that time only during\r\nthe spring; but those hatched in March will often lay in the autumn, and\r\ncontinue for two or three months. They usually lay fifty or sixty eggs,\r\nand have been known to produce 250. The faculty of laying might be\r\ngreatly developed, as it has been in some breeds of fowls; but they have\r\nbeen hitherto chiefly bred for their flesh. They require constant\r\nwatching when beginning to lay, for they drop their eggs everywhere but\r\nin the nest made for them, but as they generally lay in the night, or\r\nearly in the morning, when in perfect health, they should therefore be\r\nkept in every morning till they have laid. One of the surest signs of\r\nindisposition among them is irregularity in laying. \"The eggs of the\r\nduck,\" says Mr. Dickson, \"are readily known from those of the common\r\nfowl by their bluish colour and larger size, the shell being smoother,\r\nnot so thick, and with much fewer pores. When boiled, the white is never\r\ncurdy like that of a new-laid hen's egg, but transparent and glassy,\r\nwhile the yolk is much darker in colour. The flavour is by no means so\r\ndelicate. For omelets, however, as well as for puddings and pastry, duck\r\neggs are much better than hen's eggs, giving a finer colour and flavour,\r\nand requiring less butter; qualities so highly esteemed in Picardy, that\r\nthe women will sometimes go ten or twelve miles for duck eggs to make\r\ntheir holiday cakes.\"\r\n\r\nA hen is often made to hatch ducklings, being considered a better nurse\r\nthan a duck, which is apt to take them while too young to the pond,\r\ndragging them under beetling banks in search of food, and generally\r\nleaving half of them in the water unable to get out; and if the fly or\r\nthe gnat is on the water, she will stay there till after dark, and lose\r\npart of her brood. Ducks' eggs may be advantageously placed under a\r\nbroody exhibition hen. (_See_ page 88.) A turkey is much better than\r\neither, from the large expanse of the wings in covering the broods, and\r\nthe greater heat of body; but if the duck is a good sitter, it is best\r\nto let her hatch her own eggs, taking care to keep her and them from the\r\nwater till they are strong. The nest should be on the ground, and in a\r\ndamp place. Choose the freshest eggs, and place from nine to eleven\r\nunder her. Feed her morning and evening while sitting, and place food\r\nand water within her reach. The duck always covers her eggs upon leaving\r\nthem, and loose straw should be placed near the house for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThey are hatched in thirty days. They may generally be left with their\r\nmother upon the nest for her own time. When she moves coop her on the\r\nshort grass if fine weather, or under shelter if otherwise, for a week\r\nor ten days, when they may be allowed to swim for half an hour at a\r\ntime. When hatched they require constant feeding. A little curd,\r\nbread-crumbs, and meal, mixed with chopped green food, is the best food\r\nwhen first hatched. Boiled cold oatmeal porridge is the best food for\r\nducklings for the first ten days; afterwards barley-meal, pollard, and\r\noats, with plenty of green food. Never give them hard spring water to\r\ndrink, but that from a pond. Ducklings are easily reared, soon able to\r\nshift for themselves, and to pick up worms, slugs, and insects, and can\r\nbe cooped together in numbers at night if protected from rats. An old\r\npigsty is an excellent place for a brood of young ducks.\r\n\r\nDucklings should not be allowed to go on the water till feathers have\r\nsupplied the place of their early down, for the latter will get\r\nsaturated with the water while the former throws off the wet. \"Though\r\nthe young ducklings,\" says Mr. W. C. L. Martin, \"take early to the\r\nwater, it is better that they should gain a little strength before they\r\nbe allowed to venture into ponds or rivers; a shallow vessel of water\r\nfilled to the brim and sunk in the ground will suffice for the first\r\nweek or ten days, and this rule is more especially to be adhered to when\r\nthey are under the care of a common hen, which cannot follow them into\r\nthe pond, and the calls of which when there they pay little or no regard\r\nto. Rats, weasels, pike, and eels are formidable foes to ducklings: we\r\nhave known entire broods destroyed by the former, which, having their\r\nburrows in a steep bank around a sequestered pond, it was found\r\nimpossible to extirpate.\" If the ducklings stay too long in the water\r\nthey will have diarrhoea, in which case coop them close for a few\r\ndays, and mix bean-meal or oatmeal with their ordinary food.\r\n\r\nA troop of ducks will do good service to a kitchen garden in the summer\r\nor autumn, when they can do no mischief by devouring delicate salads and\r\nyoung sprouting vegetables. They will search industriously for snails,\r\nslugs, woodlice, and millipedes, and gobble them up eagerly, getting\r\npositively fat on slugs and snails. Strawberries, of which they are very\r\nfond, must be protected from them. Where steamed food is daily prepared\r\nfor pigs and cattle, a portion of this mixed with bran and barley-meal\r\nis the cheapest mode of satisfying their voracious appetites. They\r\nshould never be stinted in food.\r\n\r\nTo fatten ducks let them have as much substantial food as they will eat,\r\nbruised oats and peameal being the standard, plenty of exercise, and\r\nclean water. Boiled roots mixed with a little barley-meal is excellent\r\nfood, with a little milk added during fattening. They require neither\r\npenning up nor cramming to acquire plumpness, and if well fed should be\r\nfit for market in eight or ten weeks. Celery imparts a delicious\r\nflavour.\r\n\r\nThe Aylesbury is the finest breed, and should be of a spotless white,\r\nwith long, flat, broad beak of a pale flesh colour, grey eyes, long head\r\nand neck, broad and flat body and breast, and orange legs, placed wide\r\napart. As it lays early, its ducklings are the earliest ready for\r\nmarket. They have produced 150 large eggs in a year, and are better\r\nsitters than the Rouen.\r\n\r\nThe Rouen is hardy and easily reared, but rarely lay till February or\r\nMarch. They thrive better in most parts of England than the Aylesburys,\r\nand care less for the water than the other varieties. They are very\r\nhandsome, and weigh eight or nine pounds each, and their flesh is\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nThe Muscovy duck is so called, says Ray, \"not because it comes from\r\nMuscovy, but because it exhales a somewhat powerful odour of musk.\"\r\nLittle is known of its origin, which is generally thought to be South\r\nAmerica; nor has the date of its introduction into Europe been\r\nascertained. \"This species,\" says Mr. W. C. L. Martin, \"will inter-breed\r\nwith the common duck, but we believe the progeny are not fertile. The\r\nMusk duck greatly exceeds the ordinary kind in size, and moreover,\r\ndiffers in the colours and character of the plumage, in general contour,\r\nand the form of the head. The general colour is glossy blue-black,\r\nvaried more or less with white; the head is crested, and a space of\r\nnaked scarlet skin, more or less clouded with violet, surrounds the eye,\r\ncontinued from scarlet caruncles on the base of the beak; the top of the\r\nhead is crested, the feathers of the body are larger, more lax, softer,\r\nand less closely compacted together than in the common duck, and seem to\r\nindicate less aquatic habits. The male far surpasses the female in size;\r\nthere are no curled feathers in his tail.\" The male is fierce and\r\nquarrelsome, and when enraged has a savage appearance, and utters deep,\r\nhoarse sounds. The flesh is very good, but the breed is inferior as a\r\nlayer to the Aylesbury or Rouen.\r\n\r\nThe Buenos Ayres, Labrador, or East Indian, brought most probably from\r\nthe first-named country, is a small and very beautiful variety, with the\r\nplumage of a uniform rich, lustrous, greenish-black, and dark legs and\r\nbills; the drake rarely weighing five pounds, and the duck four pounds.\r\nTheir eggs are often smeared over with a slatey-coloured matter, but the\r\nshell is really of a dull white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nGEESE.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeese require much the same management as ducks. They may be kept\r\nprofitably where there is a rough pasture or common into which they may\r\nbe turned, and the pasturage is not rendered bare by sheep, as is\r\ngenerally the case; but even when the pasturage is good, a supply of\r\noats, barley, or other grain should be allowed every morning and\r\nevening. Where the pasturage is poor or bad, the old geese become thin\r\nand weak, and the young broods never thrive and often die unless fully\r\nfed at home. A goose-house for four should not be less than eight feet\r\nlong by six feet wide and six or seven feet high, with a smooth floor of\r\nbrick. A little clean straw should be spread over it every other day,\r\nafter removing that previously used, and washing the floor. Each goose\r\nshould have a compartment two feet and a half square for laying and\r\nsitting, as she will always lay where she deposited her first egg. The\r\nhouse must be well ventilated. All damp must be avoided. A pigsty makes\r\na capital pen. Although a pond is an advantage, they do not require more\r\nthan a large trough or tank to bathe in.\r\n\r\nFor breeding not more than four geese should be kept to one gander.\r\nTheir breeding powers continue to more than twenty years old. It is\r\noften difficult to distinguish the sexes, no one sign being infallible\r\nexcept close examination. The goose lays early in a mild spring, or in\r\nan ordinary season, if fed high throughout the winter with corn, and on\r\nthe commencement of the breeding season on boiled barley, malt, fresh\r\ngrains, and fine pollard mixed up with ale, or other stimulants; by\r\nwhich two broods may be obtained in a year. The common goose lays from\r\nnine to seventeen eggs, usually about thirteen, and generally carries\r\nstraws about previously to laying. Thirteen eggs are quite enough for\r\nthe largest goose to sit on. They sit from thirty to thirty-five days.\r\nMarch or early April is the best period for hatching, and the geese\r\nshould therefore begin to sit in February or early March; for goslings\r\nhatched at any time after April are difficult to rear. Food and water\r\nshould be placed near to her, for she sits closely. She ought to leave\r\nher nest daily and take a bath in a neighbouring pond. The gander is\r\nvery attentive, and sits by her, and is vigilant and daring in her\r\ndefence. When her eggs are placed under a common hen they should be\r\nsprinkled with water daily or every other day, for the moisture of the\r\ngoose's breast is beneficial to them. (See page 50.) A turkey is an\r\nexcellent mother for goslings.\r\n\r\nShe should be cooped for a few days on a dry grass-plot or meadow, with\r\ngrain and water by her, of which the goslings will eat; and they should\r\nalso be supplied with chopped cabbage or beet leaves, or other green\r\nfood. They must have a dry bed under cover and be protected from rats.\r\nTheir only dangers are heavy rains, damp floors, and vermin; and they\r\nrequire but little care for the first fortnight; while the old birds are\r\nsingularly free from maladies of all kinds common to poultry. When a\r\nfortnight old they may be allowed to go abroad with their mother and\r\nfrequent the pond. \"It has been formerly recommended,\" says Mowbray, \"to\r\nkeep the newly-hatched gulls in house during a week, lest they get cramp\r\nfrom the damp earth; but we did not find this indoor confinement\r\nnecessary; penning the goose and her brood between four hurdles upon a\r\npiece of dry grass well sheltered, putting them out late in the morning,\r\nor not at all in severe weather, and ever taking them in early in the\r\nevening. Sometimes we have pitched double the number of hurdles, for the\r\nconvenience of two broods, there being no quarrels among this sociable\r\nand harmless part of the feathered race. We did not even find it\r\nnecessary to interpose a parting hurdle, which, on occasion, may be\r\nalways conveniently done. For the first range a convenient field\r\ncontaining water is to be preferred to an extensive common, over which\r\nthe gulls or goslings are dragged by the goose, until they become\r\ncramped or tired, some of them squatting down and remaining behind at\r\nevening.\" All the hemlock or deadly nightshade within range should be\r\ndestroyed. When the corn is garnered the young geese may be turned into\r\nthe stubble which they will thoroughly glean, and many of them will be\r\nin fine condition by Michaelmas. Green geese are young geese fattened at\r\nabout the age of four months, usually on oatmeal and peas, mixed with\r\nskim-milk or butter-milk, or upon oats or other grain, and are very\r\ndelicate. In fattening geese for Christmas give oats mixed with water\r\nfor the first fortnight, and afterwards barley-meal made into a\r\ncrumbling porridge. They should be allowed to bathe for a few hours\r\nbefore being killed, for they are then plucked more easily and the\r\nfeathers are in better condition. Their feathers, down, and quills are\r\nvery valuable.\r\n\r\nGeese are very destructive to all garden and farm crops, as well as\r\nyoung trees, and must therefore be carefully kept out of orchards and\r\nplantations. Their dung, though acrid and apt to injure at first, will,\r\nwhen it is mellowed, much enrich the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Toulouse or Grey Goose is very large, of uniform grey plumage, with\r\nlong neck, having a kind of dewlap under the throat; the abdominal pouch\r\nvery much developed, almost touching the ground; short legs; flat feet;\r\nshort, broad tail; and very upright carriage, almost like a penguin. The\r\nToulouse lays a large number of eggs, sometimes as many as thirty, and\r\neven more, but rarely wishes to sit, and is a very bad mother.\r\n\r\nThe Emden or pure White is very scarce. The bill is flesh-colour, and\r\nthe legs and feet orange. They require a pond. The Toulouse, crossed\r\nwith the large white or dark-coloured common breed, produces greater\r\nweight than either, and the objection to the former as indifferent\r\nsitters and mothers is avoided; but is not desirable for breeding stock,\r\nand must have a pond like the White.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nDISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is more economical to kill at once rather than attempt to cure common\r\nfowls showing symptoms of any troublesome disease, and so save trouble,\r\nloss of their carcases, and the risk of infection. But if the fowls are\r\nfavourites, or valuable, it may be desirable to use every means of cure.\r\n\r\nSee to a sick fowl at once; prompt attention may prevent serious\r\nillness, and loss of the bird. When a fowl's plumage is seen to be\r\nbristled up and disordered, and its wings hanging or dragging, it should\r\nbe at once removed from the others, and looked to. Pale and livid combs\r\nare as certain a sign of bad health in fowls, as the paleness or\r\nlividness of the lips is in human beings. Every large establishment\r\nshould have a warm, properly ventilated, and well-lighted house,\r\ncomfortably littered down with clean straw, to be used as a hospital,\r\nand every fowl should be removed to it upon showing any symptoms of\r\nillness, even if the disease is not infectious, for sick fowls are often\r\npecked at, ill treated, and disliked by their healthy companions. Bear in\r\nmind that prevention is better than cure, and that proper management and\r\nhousing, good feeding, pure water and greens, cleanliness and exercise,\r\nwill prevent all, or nearly all, these diseases.\r\n\r\nAPOPLEXY arises from over-feeding, and can seldom be treated in time to\r\nbe of service. The only remedy is bleeding, by opening the large vein\r\nunder the wing, and pouring cold water on the head for a few minutes.\r\nOpen the vein with a lancet, or if that is not at hand, with a\r\nsharp-pointed penknife; make the incision lengthways, not across, and\r\npress the vein with your thumb between the opening and the body, when\r\nthe blood will flow. If the fowl should recover, feed it on soft, low\r\nfood for a few days, and keep it quiet. It occurs most often in laying\r\nhens, which frequently die on the nest while ejecting the egg; and is\r\nfrequently caused by too much of very stimulating food, such as\r\nhempseed, or improper diet of greaves, and also by giving too much pea\r\nor bean meal.\r\n\r\nHARD CROP, or being CROP-BOUND, is caused by too much food, especially\r\nof hard grain, being taken into the crop, so that it cannot be softened\r\nby maceration, and is therefore unable to be passed into the stomach.\r\nAlthough the bird has thus too large a supply of food in its crop, the\r\nstomach becomes empty, and the fowl eats still more food. Sometimes a\r\nfowl swallows a bone that is too large to pass into the stomach, and\r\nbeing kept in the crop forms a kernel, around which fibrous and other\r\nhard material collects. Mr. Baily says: \"Pour plenty of warm water down\r\nthe throat, and loosen the food till it is soft. Then give a\r\ntablespoonful of castor-oil, or about as much jalap as will lie on a\r\nshilling, mixed in butter; make a pill of it, and slide it into the\r\ncrop. The fowl will be well in the morning. If the crop still remain\r\nhard after this, an operation is the only remedy. The feathers should\r\nbe picked off the crop in a straight line down the middle. Generally\r\nspeaking, the crop will be found full of grass or hay, that has formed a\r\nball or some inconveniently-shaped substance. (I once took a piece of\r\ncarrot three inches long out of a crop.) When the offence has been\r\nremoved, the crop should be washed out with warm water. It should then\r\nbe sewn up with coarse thread, and the suture rubbed with grease.\r\nAfterwards the outer skin should be served the same. The crop and skin\r\nmust not be sewed together. For three or four days the patient should\r\nhave only gruel; no hard food for a fortnight.\" The slit should be made\r\nin the upper part of the crop, and just large enough to admit a blunt\r\ninstrument, with which you must gently remove the hardened mass.\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA is caused by exposure to much cold and wet, reaction after\r\nconstipation from having had too little green food, unwholesome food,\r\nand dirt. Feed on warm barley-meal, or oatmeal mashed with a little warm\r\nale, and some but not very much green food, and give five grains of\r\npowdered chalk, one grain of opium, and one grain of powdered\r\nipecacuanha twice a day till the looseness is checked. Boiled rice, with\r\na little chalk and cayenne pepper mixed, will also check the complaint.\r\nWhen the evacuations are coloured with blood, the diarrhoea has become\r\ndysentery, and cure is very doubtful.\r\n\r\nGAPES, a frequent yawning or gaping, is caused by worms in the windpipe,\r\nwhich may be removed by introducing a feather, stripped to within an\r\ninch of the point, into the windpipe, turning it round quickly, and then\r\ndrawing it out, when the parasites will be found adhering with slime\r\nupon it; but if this be not quickly and skilfully done, and with some\r\nknowledge of the anatomy of the parts touched, the bird may be killed\r\ninstead of cured. Another remedy is to put the fowl into a box, placing\r\nin it at the same time a sponge dipped in spirits of turpentine on a hot\r\nwater plate filled with boiling water, and repeating this for three or\r\nfour days. Some persons recommend, as a certain cure in a few days, half\r\na teaspoonful of spirits of turpentine mixed with a handful of grain,\r\ngiving that quantity to two dozen of chickens each day. A pinch of salt\r\nput as far back into the mouth as possible is also said to be effectual.\r\n\r\nLEG WEAKNESS, shown by the bird resting on the first joint, is generally\r\ncaused by the size and weight of the body being too great for the\r\nstrength of the legs; and this being entirely the result of weakness,\r\nthe remedy is to give strength by tonics and more nourishing food. The\r\nquality should be improved, but the quantity must not be increased, as\r\nthe disease has been caused by over-feeding having produced too much\r\nweight for the strength of the legs. Frequent bathing in cold water is\r\nvery beneficial. This is best effected by tying a towel round the fowl,\r\nand suspending it over a pail of water, with the legs only immersed.\r\n\r\nLOSS OF FEATHERS is almost always caused by want of green food, or\r\ndust-heap for cleansing. Let the fowls have both, and remove them to a\r\ngrass run if possible. But nothing will restore the feathers till the\r\nnext moult. Fowls, when too closely housed or not well supplied with\r\ngreen food and lime, sometimes eat each other's feathers, destroying the\r\nplumage till the next moult. In such cases green food and mortar rubbish\r\nshould be supplied, exercise allowed, the injured fowl should be removed\r\nto a separate place, and the pecked parts rubbed over with sulphur\r\nointment. Cut or broken feathers should be pulled out at once.\r\n\r\nPIP, a dry scale on the tongue, is not a disease, but the symptom of\r\nsome disease, being only analogous to \"a foul tongue\" in human beings.\r\nDo not scrape the tongue, nor cut off the tip, but cure the roup,\r\ndiarrhoea, bad digestion, gapes, or whatever the disease may be, and\r\nthe pip will disappear.\r\n\r\nROUP is caused by exposure to excessive wet or very cold winds. It\r\nbegins with a slight hoarseness and catching of the breath as if from\r\ncold, and terminates in an offensive discharge from the nostrils, froth\r\nin the corners of the eyes, and swollen lids. It is very contagious.\r\nSeparate the fowl from the others, keep it warm, add some \"Douglass\r\nMixture\" (see \"Moulting\") to its water daily, wash its head once or\r\ntwice daily with tepid water, feed it with meal, only mixed with hot ale\r\ninstead of water, and plenty of green food. Mr. Wright advises half a\r\ngrain of cayenne pepper with half a grain of powdered allspice in a\r\nbolus of the meal, or one of Baily's roup pills to be given daily. Mr.\r\nTegetmeier recommends one grain of sulphate of copper daily. Another\r\nadvises a spoonful of castor-oil at once, and a few hours afterwards one\r\nof Baily's roup pills, and to take the scale off the tongue, which can\r\neasily be done by holding the beak open with your left hand, and\r\nremoving the scale with the thumbnail of your right hand; with a pill\r\nevery morning for a week. If not almost well in a week it will be better\r\nto kill it.\r\n\r\nTHE THRUSH may be cured by washing the tongue and mouth with borax\r\ndissolved in tincture of myrrh and water.\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS generally affects the legs and renders the fowl unable to\r\nmove. It is chiefly caused by over-stimulating food. There is no known\r\nremedy for this disease, and the fowl seldom if ever recovers. Although\r\nchiefly affecting the legs of fowls, it is quite a different disease\r\nfrom LEG WEAKNESS.\r\n\r\nVERTIGO results from too great a flow of blood to the head, and is\r\ngenerally caused by over-feeding. Pouring cold water upon the fowl's\r\nhead, or holding it under a tap for a few minutes, will check this\r\ncomplaint, and the bird should then be purged by a dose of castor-oil or\r\nsix grains of jalap.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOULTING.\r\n\r\nAll birds, but especially old fowls, require more warmth and more\r\nnourishing diet during this drain upon their system, and should roost in\r\na warm, sheltered, and properly-ventilated house, free from all draught.\r\nDo not let them out early in the morning, if the weather is chilly, but\r\nfeed them under cover, and give them every morning warm, soft food, such\r\nas bread and ale, oatmeal and milk, potatoes mashed up in pot-liquor,\r\nwith a little pepper and a little boiled meat, as liver, &c., cut small,\r\nand a little hempseed with their grain at night. Give them in their\r\nwater some iron or \"Douglass Mixture,\" which consists of one ounce of\r\nsulphate of iron and one drachm of sulphuric acid dissolved in one quart\r\nof water; a teaspoonful of the mixture is to be added to each pint of\r\ndrinking water. This chalybeate is an excellent tonic for weakly young\r\nchickens, and young birds that are disposed to outgrow their strength.\r\nIt increases their appetite, improves the health, imparts strength,\r\nbrightens the colour of the comb, and increases the stamina of the\r\nbirds. When chickens droop and seem to suffer as the feathers on the\r\nhead grow, give them once a day meat minced fine and a little\r\ncanary-seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Piper on Poultry: their Varieties, Management, Breeding,\r\nand Diseases; Price 1s.
