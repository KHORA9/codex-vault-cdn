Of what use are the Transactions of the Academy?\r\nThese are common Questions, which most do not barely propose as\r\nQuestions; and it will not be improper to clear them.\r\n\r\nPeople very readily call useless, what they do not understand. It is a\r\nsort of Revenge; and as the Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy are\r\nknown but by few, they are generally look'd upon as useless. The reason\r\nof this is; because they are crabbed and not easily learnt.\r\n\r\nWe have a Moon to light us in the Night; What is it to us, say they,\r\nwhether _Jupiter_ hath four? Why so many laborious Observations, so many\r\ntedious Calculations to know exactly their Course? They'll not afford us\r\nthe more Light for it; and Nature, which hath plac'd these little\r\nPlanets without the reach of our Eyes, doth not seem to have made them\r\nfor us. According to this plausible Argument they ought not to have been\r\nobserv'd with a Telescope, nor study'd. But it is certain, that we had\r\nbeen considerable Loosers by it: For those who have some insight into\r\nthe Principles of Geography and Navigation know, that since these four\r\nMoons about _Jupiter_ have been discover'd, they have been more useful\r\nto those Sciences than our own Moon; and that they serve, and shall more\r\nand more serve to make new Sea-Charts, infinitely more exact than the\r\nOld; and are likely to save the Lives of a vast many Seamen. Did we reap\r\nno other advantage from Astronomy than this from these Satellites of\r\n_Jupiter_, that wou'd be sufficient to justifie those prodigious\r\nCalculations, those assiduous and nice Observations, this great number\r\nof elaborate Instruments, and this Noble Edifice built only for this\r\nScience. However the greatest part of Mankind know nothing of these\r\nSatellites of _Jupiter_, unless perhaps by hear-say, and that too\r\nconfusedly; or else they are ignorant of what Affinity they have with\r\nNavigation, or of the great Improvements which have been lately made in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis is the Fate of Sciences, which are study'd and improv'd by few.\r\nMost People are not sensible of their Progress, and especially when made\r\nin some mean Callings. But what doth it signifie, that we can now more\r\neasily direct the Course of Rivers, cut out Canals, and settle new\r\nNavigations; because our Method of taking the Level and making Sluces is\r\ninfinitely better than heretofore? Some Masons and Seamen have thereby\r\nfound their Business easier, but they themselves were not sensible of\r\nthe Skill of the Geometrician who directed them. They were mov'd, as the\r\nBody by a Soul, it doth not know. Others are yet less sensible of the\r\nGenius that presided over the Undertaking; and the World is the better\r\nfor its succeeding well, but not altogether free from Ingratitude.\r\n\r\nAnatomy, which is some time since so carefully study'd, can't become\r\nmore exact, but Chyrurgical Operations must also be more sure. Surgeons\r\nknow this; but those who receive the Benefit of their Art know nothing\r\nof it. And indeed how should they? They would be oblig'd to compare Old\r\nwith Modern Surgery; and this wou'd take too much Time, and go against\r\nthe Grain: So that since the Operation hath succeeded well, they do not\r\nthink it material to know whether it had succeeded as well in another\r\nCentury.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that so many things are before our Eyes, and that we do\r\nnot see them. Your Handycraft Shops are full of ingenious Works; but yet\r\nwe hardly mind them: And very useful and well contriv'd Instruments and\r\nExperiments want Spectators, who wou'd be wonderfully pleas'd, wou'd\r\nthey take the pains to admire them.\r\n\r\nIf a Learned Society have made some Improvements in Geometry, Anatomy,\r\nMechanicks, or any other useful Science, it must not be expected, that\r\nthe World will go back to so remote a Spring to thank and applaud them\r\nfor the Usefulness of their Productions: For it will be more easie to\r\nenjoy the Benefit of their Discoveries and Improvements than to know\r\nthem. The Determination of Longitude by the Satellites, the Discovery of\r\nthe _Ductus Thoracicus_, a more convenient, and more exact Level, are\r\nnot Novelties so fit to make a noise as a pleasant Poem, or a handsome\r\nPiece of Oratory.\r\n\r\nAltho' the Usefulness of Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy is obscure,\r\nyet it is real. To consider Mankind in their Natural State, nothing is\r\nmore useful to them, than what may preserve their Lives, and produce\r\nthose Arts, which are both great Helps and Ornaments to Publick\r\nSocieties.\r\n\r\nAs for what concerns the Preservation of Life, it peculiarly belongs to\r\nPhysick; which for that reason is divided in the Academy into three\r\nBranches, which make three different sorts of Members of this Society,\r\nAnatomy, Chymistry, and Botanicks. Every Body knows of what Importance\r\nit is to have an exact Knowledge of Human Body, and of what Medicines\r\nmay be extracted from Minerals and Plants.\r\n\r\nAs for Arts, too tedious to be reckon'd, they depend some upon Natural\r\nPhilosophy, others upon Mathematicks.\r\n\r\nOne wou'd think at first, that if the Mathematicks were to be confin'd\r\nto what is useful in them, they ought only to be improv'd in those\r\nthings, which have an immediate and sensible affinity with Arts, and the\r\nrest ought to be neglected as a Vain Theory. But this wou'd be a very\r\nwrong Notion. As for Instance, the Art of Navigation hath a necessary\r\nConnexion with Astronomy, and Astronomy can never be too much improv'd\r\nfor the Benefit of Navigation. Astronomy cannot be without Opticks by\r\nreason of Perspective Glasses; and both, as all other Parts of\r\nMathematicks, are grounded upon Geometry, and to go as far as you can,\r\neven upon Algebra.\r\n\r\nGeometry, and especially Algebra, are the Keys of all the Inquiries,\r\nthat can be made concerning Magnitude. These Sciences which are only\r\nconversant about abstruse Relations, and simple Ideas, may seem dry and\r\nbarren, whilst they keep within the Verge of the Intellectual World; but\r\nmixt Mathematicks, which stoop to Matter, and consider the Motion of the\r\nStars, the Augmentation of moving Forces, the different Passages of the\r\nRays of Light through different Mediums; the different Effects of Sound\r\nby the Vibration of Things; to conclude all those Sciences, which\r\ndiscover the particular Relations of Sensible Magnitudes go on farther\r\nand more securely, when the Art of discovering Relations in General is\r\nmore perfect. The Universal Instrument cannot be too extensive, too\r\nhandy, or too easily apply'd: It is useful to all the Sciences, and they\r\ncannot be without it: And therefore among the Mathematicians of the\r\nAcademy, who are design'd to be useful to the Publick, the Geometricians\r\nand Algebrists make a Class, as well as the Astronomers and Mechanicks.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is certain, that Speculations purely of Geometry, or of\r\nAlgebra, are not about useful things: But it is certain too, that those\r\nthat are not, either lead or belong to those that are. It is in it self\r\na very barren thing to know, that in a Parabola a Subtangant is double\r\nthe corresponding Abscissæ; but yet it is a Degree of Knowledge\r\nnecessary to the Art of throwing Bombs, so exactly as they can do now.\r\nThere are not by far so many evident Uses as Propositions or Truths in\r\nthe Mathematicks: Yet it is enough if the Concourse of several Truths is\r\ngenerally of some use.\r\n\r\nFarther, a Geometrical Speculation, which was not at first applicable to\r\nany use, becomes so afterwards. When the greatest Geometricians in the\r\nSeventeenth Century set about to study a new Curve, which they call'd a\r\nCycloide, they only engag'd themselves in a meer Speculation out of\r\nVanity, striving to outdo one another by the Discovery of difficult\r\nTheorems. They did not even pretend that this was for the Publick Good;\r\nhowever by diving into the Nature of the Cycloide it was found, that it\r\nwas destin'd to make Pendulums as perfect as may be, and carry the\r\nMeasure of Time as far as it can go.\r\n\r\nIt is the same thing with Natural Philosophy as with Geometry. The\r\nAnatomy of Animals seems insignificant; and it only concerns us to know\r\nthat of Human Body. But yet some Parts of it, which are of so nice, or\r\nso confus'd a Make, that they are invisible, are sensible and manifest\r\nin the Body of an Animal. Hence it is, that Monsters themselves are not\r\nto be neglected. The Mechanism conceal'd in a particular Kind or in a\r\ncommon Make, is unfolded in another kind, or in an extraordinary Make;\r\nand one wou'd be almost apt to say, that Nature by multiplying and\r\nvarying so much her Works, can't sometimes forbear betraying her\r\nSecrets. All that the Antients knew of the Load-stone, was, that it\r\nattracts Iron. But whether they did not value a Curiosity, which\r\npromis'd them nothing; or that their Genius did not lead them to make\r\nExperiments, they have not examin'd this Stone as carefully as they\r\nmight. One Experiment taught them, that it turns of its self towards the\r\nPoles of the World, and did put into their Hands the inestimable\r\nTreasure of the Mariners Compass. They might easily have made this\r\nDiscovery important, and yet they did not do it; and if they had spent a\r\nlittle more time upon a Curiosity which seem'd useless to them, the\r\nLatent use of it had soon appear'd.\r\n\r\nLet us always make a Collection of Mathematical and Physical Truths;\r\nhappen what it will we can't hazard much by it. It is certain, that they\r\nshall be drawn from Springs, whence a great many useful ones have\r\nalready been drawn. We have reason to presume, that we shall draw from\r\nthence, some that shall shine as soon as they are discover'd, and\r\nconvince us of their Usefulness. Other Truths shall stay some time till\r\na piercing Meditation, or some happy Accident discovers their Use. Some\r\nTruths being consider'd by themselves shall be barren, till they are\r\nconsider'd with reference to one another. Lastly, let the worse come to\r\nthe worse, some shall be eternally useless.\r\n\r\nI mean useless with reference to sensible and gross Uses; for otherwise\r\nthey shall not be so. An Object upon which alone you cast your Eyes is\r\nthe clearer and brighter, when the neighbouring Objects, which however\r\nyou do not look upon, are also enlighten'd; because it hath the Benefit\r\nof the Rays, which are reflected from them. Thus those Discoveries,\r\nwhich are palpably useful, and deserve our chiefest Attention, are in\r\nsome measure enlighten'd by those, which may be call'd useless. For all\r\nTruths make one another more lucid.\r\n\r\nIt is always useful to have right Notions, even of useless Subjects. And\r\ntho' we cou'd reap no benefit by the Knowledge of Numbers and Sines, yet\r\nit wou'd still be the only certain Knowledge granted to our Natural\r\nLight, and they wou'd serve to give our Reason the first Habit of and\r\nInclination to Truth. They wou'd teach us to operate upon Truths; to\r\ntake the Thread of them, which is generally very fine and almost\r\nimperceptible; and to follow it as far as it reaches: In a word, they\r\nwou'd make Truth so familiar, that we might on other Occasions know it\r\nat first sight, and almost by Instinct.\r\n\r\nA Geometrical Genius is not so confin'd to Geometry, but that it may be\r\ncapable of learning other Sciences. A Tract of Morality, Politicks, or\r\nCriticism, and even a Piece of Oratory, supposing the Author qualify'd\r\notherwise for those Performances, shall be the better for being compos'd\r\nby a Geometrician. That Order, Perspicuity, _Precision_ and Exactness,\r\nwhich some time since are found in good Books, may originally proceed\r\nfrom that Geometrical Genius, which is now more common than ever, and in\r\nsome manner is communicated by one Relation to another, nay even to\r\nthose that do not understand Geometry. Sometimes a Great Man draws all\r\nhis Cotemporaries after him; and he who hath the justest Claim to the\r\nGlory of having settled a new Art of Arguing, was an Excellent\r\nGeometrician.\r\n\r\nLastly, whatever raises us to Great and Noble Reflexions, tho' they be\r\npurely Speculative, afford a Spiritual and Philosophical _Utility_. The\r\nWants of the Mind are perhaps as many as those of the Body. She desires\r\nto extend her Knowledge: All that can be known, is necessary to her, and\r\nthere can be no better Proof than this, that she is design'd for Truth.\r\nNothing perhaps can redound more to her Glory, than the Pleasure that is\r\nfelt sometimes, in spight of ones self, in the dry and crabbed Questions\r\nof Algebra.\r\n\r\nBut without running counter to the common Notions, and recurring to\r\nAdvantages which may seem too far fetch'd and refin'd, it may fairly be\r\nown'd, that the Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy have some things\r\nwhich are only subservient to Curiosity; and so have those Sciences\r\nwhich are most generally acknowledg'd to be useful, as History, _&c._\r\n\r\nHistory doth not in every Part of it supply us with Examples of Vertue\r\nand Rules for our Behaviour. For besides these, therein you have a View\r\nof the perpetual Revolutions of Human Affairs, of the Beginning and Fall\r\nof Empires, of Manners, Customs, and Opinions which continually succeed\r\none another; and in a word, of all that rapid, tho' insensible, Motion\r\nthat carries all before it, and incessantly alters the Face of the Earth.\r\n\r\nHad we a mind to oppose Curiosity to Curiosity, we shou'd find that\r\ninstead of the Motion, which agitates Nations, and gives birth to, and\r\ndestroys States; Natural Philosophy considers that Great and Universal\r\nMotion, which hath put the whole Frame of Nature in Order, and suspended\r\nthe Cœlestial Bodies in several Spheres, and which illuminates and\r\nextinguishes some Stars; and by following always unalterable Laws,\r\ndiversifies its effects _ad infinitum_. If the surprising difference of\r\nManners and Opinions of Mankind is so entertaining; there is too a great\r\ndeal of Pleasure to study the prodigious diversity of the Structure of\r\nthe different Species of Animals, with reference to their different\r\nFunctions, to the Elements they live in, to the Climates they inhabit,\r\nand the Aliments they are to take, _&c._ The most curious strokes of\r\nHistory shall hardly be more curious than the _Phosphorus_, the cold\r\nLiquors which being mixt together, break out into a flame; Silver Trees,\r\nthe almost Magical Operations of the Load-Stone, and a vast number of\r\nSecrets, which Art hath discover'd by a near and diligent Scrutiny of\r\nNature.\r\n\r\nLastly, Natural Philosophy doth as much as it is possible unravel the\r\nFootsteps of that Infinite Intellect and Wisdom, who hath made all\r\nthings: Whereas the Object of History are the disorderly Effects of the\r\nPassion, and of Humane Caprices; and so odd a Series of Events, that\r\nsome formerly fancy'd that a Blind and Senseless Deity had the Direction\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nWe must not look upon the Sublime Reflexions which Natural Philosophy\r\nleads us to make concerning the Author of the Universe, as meer\r\nCuriosities. For this stupendous Work, which appears always more\r\nwonderful the more we know it, gives us such exalted Notions of its\r\nMaker, that they fill our Minds with Admiration and Respect. But above\r\nall, Astronomy and Anatomy are the two Sciences which more palpably lay\r\nbefore us two grand Attributes of our Creator; one his Immensity by the\r\ndistance, Magnitude and Number of Cœlestial Bodies; the other his\r\nInfinite Knowledge by the Mechanism of Animals. True Natural Philosophy\r\nis a kind of Theology.\r\n\r\nThe different views of Humane Understanding are almost infinite; and\r\nNature is really so. So that we may every day expect some Discoveries,\r\neither in Mathematicks or Natural Philosophy, which shall be of a new\r\nsort of Utility or Curiosity. Make a Collection of all the different\r\nAdvantages which the Mathematicks afforded a Hundred Years ago, and\r\nyou'll find nothing to be compar'd to the Perspective Glasses they have\r\nfurnish'd since that time, and which are a new Organ to the Sight, and\r\ncou'd not be expected from Art. How surpriz'd had the Ancients been, if\r\nthey had been told that their Posterity, by the help of some\r\nInstruments, shou'd one day see a vast number of Objects which they did\r\nnot see; a Heaven that was unknown to them; and Plants and Animals they\r\ndid not even suspect it was possible to exist. Naturalists had already a\r\ngreat many curious Experiments; but within about half a Century, the\r\nAir-Pump hath produced a prodigious quantity of them wholly new, and\r\nwhich by shewing Bodies in a Space void of Air, shews them as\r\ntransported in a World different from ours, where they undergo\r\nAlterations whereof we had no Notion. The Excellency of Geometrical\r\nMethods, which are every day invented and improv'd, may perhaps at last\r\nexhaust Geometry; that is, The Art of making Geometrical Discoveries,\r\nand that is all: Whereas Natural Philosophy, which contemplates an\r\nObject of an unlimited Variety, and _Fæcundity_, shall always find room\r\nfor new Observations, and opportunities to increase its vast Stock, and\r\nshall have the Advantage of never being a compleat Science.\r\n\r\nThere are so many things to be discover'd, whereof a great part, in all\r\nlikelyhood shall never be known; that they give an opportunity to those\r\nwho will not encounter with the Thorns and Difficulties of Natural\r\nPhilosophy, to affect a sort of Discouragement. A great many to vilify\r\nthis Natural Science, pretend a mighty veneration for the works of\r\nNature, and that they are absolutely incomprehensible. However, Nature\r\nis never so admirable, nor so admir'd as when known. True it is, that\r\nwhat is known is inconsiderable in comparison of what is not yet known.\r\nNay, Sometimes what is not known, is exactly what seems shou'd be the\r\nsoonest known. As for instance, it is not at least certainly known, why\r\na Stone thrown up into the Air falls down again; but we certainly know\r\nthe cause of the Rainbow, why it doth not exceed a certain height; why\r\nits breadth is always the same; why when there are two Rainbows at the\r\nsame time, the Colours of the one are overset with reference to the\r\nColours of the other; and yet the fall of a Stone in the Air appears a\r\nmore simple Phænomenon, than the Rainbow. But in a word, altho' we do\r\nnot know every thing, we are not neither ignorant of every thing. And\r\naltho' we are ignorant of the most simple Events, yet we have a\r\nknowledge of what seems the most Complex. So that if we have on the one\r\nhand reason to fear, lest our Vanity shou'd flatter us with the hopes of\r\nattaining to the knowledge of things above our reach; on the other we\r\nought to dread, lest our Slothfulness should also flatter us that we are\r\ncondemn'd to a greater degree of Ignorance than really we are.\r\n\r\nPeople may think that the Sciences do not begin to exert themselves,\r\neither because they cou'd be but imperfect among the Ancients; or\r\nbecause we have almost lost the Footsteps of them during the gloomy\r\nDarkness of Barbarity; or because a better method hath been taken about\r\n100 Years ago. Was the Progress Historically examin'd, they have already\r\nmade in so short a time, notwithstanding the strong, but false\r\nPrejudices they had long to encounter with, even sometimes the foreign\r\nObstacles they have met with from Authority and Power; the want of Zeal\r\nfor Sciences so remote from common use, those few who apply'd themselves\r\nto this Work, and the weak Motives which engag'd them in it; a Man would\r\nwonder at the Greatness and Rapidity of the Progress of the Sciences,\r\nand even we might observe some new ones to start out of nothing, and\r\nperhaps be tempted to have too great hopes of future Improvements.\r\n\r\nThe greater reason we have of future Success, the greater we have to\r\nlook upon the Sciences as in their Cradles, at least Natural Philosophy.\r\nAnd therefore the Academy is only now employ'd to make an ample\r\nProvision of Observations, and Facts well attested, which may one day be\r\nthe foundation of a System. For before the Systematical Natural\r\nPhilosophy can raise solid Edifices; Experimental Natural Philosophy\r\nmust be in a condition to supply it with good Materials.\r\n\r\nNone but Societies, of those too countenanc'd and encourag'd by the\r\nPrince, can successfully make and prepare this Collection of Materials.\r\nAll the Learning, Care, Life and Wealth of one Private Man can never\r\nanswer this Design. There are too many different Experiments to be made,\r\nwhich are to be too much vary'd, and a long time prosecuted with the\r\nsame Temper and Mind. The Cause of the least Effect is so wrap'd up,\r\nthat unless you very carefully open all the various Foldings, you cannot\r\ncome at it.\r\n\r\nHitherto the Academy of Sciences hath consider'd Nature but by parcels:\r\nThey have fix'd upon no general System, for fear of falling into the\r\ninconveniency of hasty Systems, which are very grateful to the\r\nimpatience of Humane Understanding; and being once settled, are\r\nObstacles to what Truths are afterwards discover'd. This day we are sure\r\nof a Fact, to morrow we shall be sure of another that hath no relation\r\nwith the former. However some Conjectures are ventur'd at upon Causes;\r\nbut they are only Conjectures. So that this Collection, which the\r\nAcademy gives to the Publick, is compos'd of separate Fragments,\r\nindependant of one another; whereof every one who is the Author,\r\nwarrants the Facts and Experiments; and whose Arguments are approv'd by\r\nthe Academy, but with Restrictions becoming Wise and Wary Scepticks.\r\n\r\nTime perhaps will come, when these scatter'd Fragments shall be united\r\ninto one regular Body; and if they be such as they are wish'd, they may\r\nof themselves Unite. A great many Truths, when their Numbers is\r\nconsiderable, shew so near a Relation to, and so mutual a Dependance\r\nupon one another, that it seems, that notwithstanding their violent\r\nSeparation, they have a natural Tendency to be re-united.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEA CURIOSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An Estimate of the Quantity of the Vapours raised out of the Sea\r\n   derived from Experiment: Together with an Account of the Circulation\r\n   of the watry Vapours of the Sea, and of the Cause of Springs,\r\n   presented to the Royal Society. By Mr. _E. Halley, F. R. S.__\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the Quantity of Aqueous Vapours contain'd in the Medium of the Air,\r\nis very considerable, seems most evident from the great Rains and Snows\r\nwhich are sometimes observ'd to fall, to that degree, that the Water\r\nthus discharg'd out of the Interstices of the Particles of Air, is in\r\nweight a very sensible part of the incumbent Atmosphere: But in what\r\nproportion these Vapours rise, which are the Sources not only of Rains,\r\nbut also of Springs or Fountains (as I design to prove) has not, that I\r\nknow of, been any where well examin'd, tho' it seem to be one of the\r\nmost necessary Ingredients of a Real and Philosophical Meteorology, and,\r\nas such; to deserve the Consideration of this Honourable Society. I\r\nthought it might not be unacceptable to attempt by Experiment to\r\ndetermine the Quantity of the Evaporations of Water, as far as they\r\narise from Heat, which upon Trial succeeded as follows.\r\n\r\nWe took a Pan of Water, about 4 inches deep, and 7 Inches 9/10 Diameter,\r\nin which we placed a Thermometer, and by means of a Pan of Coals, we\r\nbrought the Water to the same degree of Heat, which is observed to be\r\nthat of the Air in our hottest Summer; the Thermometer nicely shewing\r\nit: This done, we affixed the Pan of Water, with the Thermometer in it,\r\nto one end of the Beam of a Pair of Scales, and exactly counterpois'd it\r\nwith weights in the other Scale; and by the application or removal of\r\nthe Pan of Coals, we found it very easie to maintain the Water in the\r\nsame degree of Heat precisely. Doing thus we found the weight of the\r\nWater sensibly to decrease; and at the end of two hours we observed that\r\nthere wanted half an Ounce _Troy_, all but 7 grains, or 233 grains of\r\nWater, which in that time had gone off in Vapour; tho' one could hardly\r\nperceive it smoke, and the Water were not sensibly warm. This Quantity\r\nin so short a time seem'd very considerable, being little less than 6\r\nounces in 24 hours, from so small a Surface as a Circle of 8 inches\r\nDiameter. To reduce this Experiment to an exact Calculus, and determine\r\nthe thickness of the Skin of Water that had so evaporated, I assume the\r\nExperiment alledg'd by Dr. _Edward Bernard_ to have been made in the\r\n_Oxford_ Society, _viz._ That the Cube-foot _English_ of Water weighs\r\nexactly 76 Pounds _Troy_; this divided by 1728, the number of Inches in\r\na Foot, will give 253⅓ grains, or ½ ounce 13⅓ grains for the\r\nweight of a Cube-inch of Water; wherefore the weight of 233 grains is\r\n233/253 or 35 Parts of 38 of a Cube-inch of Water. Now the Area of the\r\nCircle whose Diameter is 7-9/10 Inches, is 49 square Inches: by which\r\ndividing the Quantity of Water evaporated, _viz._ 35/38 of an Inch, the\r\nQuote 35/1862 or 1/53 shews that the thickness of the Water evaporated\r\nwas the 53d part of an Inch; but we will suppose it only the 60th part,\r\nfor the Facility of Calculation. If therefore Water as warm as the Air\r\nin Summer, exhales the thickness of a 60th part of an Inch in two hours\r\nfrom its whole Surface, in 12 hours it will exhale the ⅒ of an Inch;\r\nwhich Quantity will be found abundantly sufficient to serve for all the\r\nRains, Springs, and Dews; and account for the _Caspian_ Sea, being\r\nalways at a stand, neither wasting nor overflowing; as likewise for the\r\nCurrent said to set always in at the Streights of _Gibralter_, tho'\r\nthose Mediterranean Seas receive so many and so considerable Rivers.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the Quantity of Water arising in Vapours out of the Sea, I\r\nthink I ought to consider it only for the time the Sun is up, for that\r\nthe Dews return in the Night, as much if not more Vapours than are then\r\nemitted; and in Summer the Days being no longer than 12 hours, this\r\nExcess is ballanc'd by the weaker Action of the Sun, especially when\r\nrising before the Water be warmed: So that if I allow ⅒ of an Inch of\r\nthe Surface of the Sea, to be raised _per diem_ in Vapours, it may not\r\nbe an improbable Conjecture.\r\n\r\nUpon this Supposition, every 10 square Inches of the Surface of the\r\nWater, yields in Vapour _per diem_ a Cube-inch of Water; and each square\r\nFoot half a Wine-pint; every Space of 4 Foot square, a Gallon; a Mile\r\nsquare, 6914 Tons; a square Degree suppose of 69 _English_ Miles, will\r\nevaporate 33 Millions of Tons: And if the Mediterranean be estimated at\r\nforty degrees long and four broad, allowances being made for the Places\r\nwhere it is broader, by those where it is narrower (and I am sure I\r\nguess at the least) there will be 160 Square degrees of Sea; and\r\nconsequently, the whole Mediterranean must lose in Vapour, in a Summer's\r\nday, at least 5280 Millions of Tons. And this Quantity of Vapour, tho'\r\nvery great, is as little as can be concluded from the Experiment\r\nproduced: And yet there remains another Cause, which cannot be reduced\r\nto Rule, I mean the Winds, whereby the Surface of the Water is licked up\r\nsome times faster than it exhales by the heat of the Sun; as is well\r\nknown to those that have consider'd those drying Winds which blow\r\nsometimes.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the Quantity of Water, the Mediterranean Sea receives from\r\nthe Rivers that fall into it, is a very hard Task, unless one had the\r\nOpportunity to measure their Chanels and Velocity; and therefore we can\r\nonly do it by allowing more than enough; that is, by assuming these\r\nRivers greater than in all probability they be, and then comparing the\r\nQuantity of Water voided by the _Thames_, with that of those Rivers,\r\nwhose Waters we desire to compute.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean receives these considerable Rivers; the _Iberus_, the\r\n_Rhone_, the _Tiber_, the _Po_, the _Danube_, the _Neister_, the\r\n_Borystenes_, the _Tanais_, and the _Nile_; all the rest being of no\r\ngreat Note, and their Quantity of Water inconsiderable: These nine\r\nRivers, we will suppose each of them to bring down ten times as much\r\nWater as the River _Thames_; not that any of them is great in reality,\r\nbut to comprehend with them all the small Rivulets that fall into the\r\nSea, which otherwise I know not how to allow for.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the Water of the _Thames_, I assume that at _Kingston_\r\nBridge where the Flood never reaches, and the Water always runs down,\r\nthe breadth of the Chanel is 100 Yards, and its Depth 3, it being\r\nreduced to an Equality (in both which Suppositions I am sure I take with\r\nthe most) hence the Profil of the Water in this Place is 300 square\r\nYards: This multiplied by 48 Miles (which I allow the Water to run in 24\r\nhours, at 2 Miles an hour) or 84480 Yards, gives 25344000 Cubick-yards\r\nof Water to be evacuated every Day; that is, 20300000 Tons _per diem_;\r\nand I doubt not, but in the excess of my Measures of the Chanel of the\r\nRiver, I have made more than sufficient allowance for the Waters of the\r\n_Brent_, the _Wandel_, the _Lea_, and _Darwent_, which are all worth\r\nnotice, that fall into the _Thames_ below _Kingston_.\r\n\r\nNow if each of the aforesaid 9 Rivers yield 10 times as much Water as\r\nthe _Thames_ doth, 'twill follow that each of them yields but 203\r\nMillions of Ton _per diem_, and the whole 9, but 1827 Millions of Tons\r\nin a day; which is but little more than ⅓ of what is proved to be\r\nraised in vapour out of the Mediterranean in 12 hours time. Now what\r\nbecomes of this Vapour when rais'd, and how it comes to pass that the\r\nCurrent always sets in at the Mouth, of the Streights of _Gibralter_,\r\nshall immediately be shew'd: But first it is necessary to advertise the\r\nReader, that in making the Experiment herein mention'd, the Water used\r\nhad been salted to the same degree as is the common Sea-water, by the\r\nSolution of about a 40th part of Salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus shew'd by Experiment the Quantity of Water raised in Vapour\r\nfrom the Surface of the Sea in a Days time, which was so far approv'd of\r\nby some Honourable Members of this Society, that I receiv'd their\r\nCommands to prosecute these Enquiries; and particularly, in relation to\r\nthe Method used by Nature, to return the said Vapours again into the\r\nSea; which is so justly perform'd, that in many hundred of Years we are\r\nsufficiently assured that the Sea has not sensibly decreased by the loss\r\nin Vapour; nor yet abounded by the immense Quantity of fresh it receives\r\ncontinually from the Rivers. To demonstrate this Equilibre of Receipt\r\nand Expence in the whole Sea, is a Task too hard for me to undertake,\r\nyet in obedience to those whom I have the Honour to serve, I shall here\r\noffer, what to me has hitherto seem'd the most satisfactory Account of\r\nthis grand _Phænomenon_: I have in another place attempted to explain\r\nthe manner of the rising of Vapour by Warmth, by shewing, that if an\r\nAtom of Water were expanded into a Shell or Bubble, so as to be ten\r\ntimes as big in Diameter as when it was Water; such an Atom would become\r\nspecifically lighter than Air, and rise so long as that _Flatus_ or warm\r\nSpirit that first separated it from the Mass of Water, shall continue to\r\ndistend it to the same Degree; and that Warmth declining, and the Air\r\ngrowing cooler and also specifically lighter, the Vapours consequently\r\nshall stop at a certain Region of the Air, or else descend, which may\r\nhappen upon several accounts, as I shall by and by endeavour to make\r\nout; yet I undertake not that this is the only principal of the rise of\r\nVapours, and that there may not be a certain sort of Matter, whose\r\n_Conatus_ may be contrary to that of Gravity; as is evident in\r\nVegetation, where in the Tendency of the Sprouts is directly upwards, or\r\nagainst the Perpendicular. But what ever is the true Cause, it is in\r\nFact certain, that warmth does separate the Particles of Water, and emit\r\nthem with a greater and greater Velocity, as the heat is more and more\r\nintense; as is evident in the Steam of a boiling Cauldron, wherein\r\nlikewise the Velocity of the ascent of the Vapours does visibly decrease\r\ntill they disappear, being dispersed into and assimulated with the\r\nAmbient Air. Vapours being thus raised by warmth, let us for a first\r\nSupposition put, that the whole Surface of the Globe were all Water very\r\ndeep, or rather that the whole Body of the Earth were Water, and that\r\nthe Sun had its diurnal course about it: I take it, that it would\r\nfollow, that the Air of it self would imbibe a certain Quantity of\r\naqueous Vapours, and retain them like Salts dissolved in Water; that the\r\nSun warming the Air, and raising a more plentiful Vapour from the Water\r\nin the day-time, the Air would sustain a greater proportion of Vapour,\r\nas warm Water will hold more dissolved Salts, which upon the absence of\r\nthe Sun in the Nights would be all again discharged in Dews, analogous\r\nto the Precipitation of Salts on the cooling of the Liquors; nor is it\r\nto be believed that in such Case there would be any diversity of\r\nWeather, other than periodically, every Year alike; the mixture of all\r\nterrestrious, saline, heterogenious Vapours being taken away, which as\r\nthey are variously compounded and brought by the Winds, seem to be the\r\nCauses of those various Seasons which we now find. In this case the\r\nAiery Regions every where, at the same height, would be equally\r\nreplenished with the Proportion of Water it could contain, regard being\r\nonly to be had to the different degree of warmth, from the nearness or\r\ndistance of the Sun; and an eternal East-wind would blow all round the\r\nGlobe, inclining only to the same side of the _East_, as the Latitude\r\ndoth from the Equator; as is observed in the Ocean between the Tropicks.\r\n\r\nNext let us suppose this Ocean interspersed with wide and spacious\r\nTracts of Land, with high Ridges of Mountains, such as the _Pyrenean_,\r\nthe _Alps_, the _Apennine_, the _Carpathian_ in _Europe_, _Taurus_,\r\n_Caucasus_, _Imaus_, and several others in _Asia_; _Atlas_ and the\r\n_Montes Lunæ_, with other unknown Ridges in _Africa_, whence came the\r\n_Nile_, the _Nigre_, and the _Zaire_: And in _America_, the _Andes_ and\r\nthe _Apalatean_ Mountains; each of which far surpass the usual height to\r\nwhich the Aqueous Vapours of themselves ascend, and on the tops of which\r\nthe Air is so cold and rarified, as to retain but a small part of those\r\nVapours, that shall be brought thither by Winds. Those Vapours therefore\r\nthat are raised copiously in the Sea, and by the Wind, are carried over\r\nthe low Land to those Ridges of Mountains, are there compelled by the\r\nStream of the Air to mount up with it to the tops of the Mountains,\r\nwhere the Water presently precipitates, gleeting down by the Crannies of\r\nthe Stone; and part of the Vapour entering into the Caverns of the\r\nHills, the Water thereof gathers as in an Alembick into the Basons of\r\nStone it finds; which being once fill'd, all the overplus of Water that\r\ncomes thither runs over by the lowest place, and breaking out by the\r\nsides of the Hills, forms single _Springs_. Many of these running down\r\nby the Valleys or Guts between the Ridges of the Hills, and coming to\r\nunite, form little Rivulets, or Brooks: Many of these again, meeting in\r\none common Valley and gaining the plain Ground, being grown less rapid,\r\nbecome a River; and many of these being united in one common Channel,\r\nmake such Streams as the _Rhine_, the _Rhone_, the _Danube_; which\r\nlatter, one would hardly think the Collection of Water condensed out of\r\nVapour, unless we consider how vast a Tract of Ground that River drains,\r\nand that it is the Sum of all those Springs which break out on the South\r\nside of the _Carpathian_ Mountains, and on the North side of the immense\r\nRidge of the _Alps_, which is one continued Chain of Mountains from\r\n_Switzerland_, to the _Black-Sea_. And it may almost pass for a Rule,\r\nthat the magnitude of a River, or the quantity of Water it evacuates, is\r\nproportionable to the length and height of the Ridges from whence its\r\nFountains arise. Now this Theory of _Springs_ is not a bare\r\n_Hypothesis_, but founded on Experience, which it was my luck to gain in\r\nmy abode at St. _Helena_, where in the Night-time, on the tops of the\r\nHills, about 800 Yards above the Sea, there was so strange a\r\ncondensation, or rather precipitation of the Vapours, that it was a\r\ngreat Impediment to my Cœlestial Observations; for in the clear Sky,\r\nthe Dew would fall so fast, as to cover, each half quarter of an Hour,\r\nmy Glasses with little drops; so that I was necessitated to wipe them so\r\noften, and my Paper on which I wrote my Observations would immediately\r\nbe so wet with Dew, that it would not bear Ink: By which it may be\r\nsuppos'd how fast the Water gathers in those mighty high Ridges I but\r\nnow nam'd.\r\n\r\nThus is one part of the Vapours blown upon the Land return'd by the\r\nRivers into the Sea, from whence they came; another part by the cool of\r\nthe Night falls in Dews, or else in Rains, again into the Sea before it\r\nreaches the Land, which is by much the greatest part of the whole\r\nVapours, because of the great extent of the Ocean, which the motion of\r\nthe Wind does not traverse in a very long space of Time; and this is the\r\nReason why the Rivers do not return so much into the _Mediterranean_, as\r\nis extracted into Vapour. A third part falls on the Low-Lands, and is\r\nthe _Pabulum_ of Plants, where yet it does not rest, but is again\r\nexhaled in Vapour by the action of the Sun, and is either carried by the\r\nWinds to the Sea to fall in Rain or Dew there, or else to the Mountains\r\nto be there turn'd into Springs; and tho' this does not immediately come\r\nto pass, yet after several Vicissitudes of rising in Vapour, and falling\r\nin Rain or Dews, each Particle of the Water is at length return'd to the\r\nSea from whence it came. Add to this, that the Rain-waters after the\r\nEarth is fully sated with moisture, does, by the Vallies or lower parts\r\nof the Earth, find its way into the Rivers, and so is compendiously sent\r\nback to the Sea. After this manner is the Circulation perform'd, and I\r\ndoubt not but this Hypothesis is more reasonable than that of those who\r\nderive all Springs from the Rain-waters, which yet are perpetual and\r\nwithout diminution, even when no Rain falls for a long space of time; or\r\nthat derive them from a Filtration or Percolation of the Sea-waters,\r\nthro' certain imaginary Tubes or Passages within the Earth wherein they\r\nlose their Saltness. This, besides many others, labouring under this\r\nprincipal Absurdity, that the greatest Rivers have their most copious\r\nFountains farthest from the Sea, and whether so great quantities of\r\nfresh Water cannot reasonably be deriv'd any other way than in Vapour.\r\nThis, if we may allow final Causes, seems to be the design of the Hills,\r\nthat their Ridges being plac'd thro' the midst of the Continents, might\r\nserve, as it were, for Alembicks to distil fresh Water for the use of\r\nMan and Beast, and their heights to give a descent to those Streams to\r\nrun gently, like so many Veins, of the _Macrocosm_ to be the more\r\nbeneficial to the Creation. If the difference between Rain and Dew, and\r\nthe cause why sometimes 'tis Cloudy, at other times Serene, be inquir'd,\r\nI can offer nothing like a proper Solution thereof, only with submission\r\nto propose Conjectures, which are the best I can find, _viz._ That the\r\nAir being heaped up by the meeting of two contrary Winds, when the\r\n_Mercury_ is high, the Vapours are the better sustain'd and kept from\r\nCo-agulating or Condensing into Drops, whereby Clouds are not so easily\r\ngenerated, and the Night the Vapours fall down single, as they rose in\r\nimperceptible Atoms of Water: Whereas, when the _Mercury_ is low, And\r\nthe Air rarified by the Exhaustion thereof, by two contrary Winds\r\nblowing from the place; the Atoms of Air keep the Vapours not so well\r\nseparated, and they coalesce into visible Drops in the Clouds, and from\r\nthence are easily drawn into greater Drops of Rain; to which 'tis\r\npossible and not improbable, that some sort of Saline or Angular\r\nParticles of Terrestrial Vapour being immix'd with the Aqueous, which I\r\ntake to be Bubbles, may cut or break their Skins or Coats, and so\r\ncontribute to their more speedy Condensation into Rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _The True Theory of the Tides, extracted from that admired Treatise of\r\n   Mr. _Isaac Newton_, Intitled, _Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia\r\n   Mathematica_; Being a Discourse presented with that Book to the late\r\n   King _James_, by Mr. _Edmund Halley_._\r\n\r\n\r\n_It may, perhaps, seem strange, that this Paper, being no other than a\r\nparticular Account of a Book long since published, should now appear\r\nhere; but the Desires of several honourable Persons, which could not be\r\nwithstood, have obliged us to insert it here, for the sake of such, who\r\nbeing less knowing in Mathematical Matters, and therefore not daring to\r\nadventure on the Author himself, are notwithstanding, very curious to be\r\ninform'd of the Causes of Things; particularly of so general and\r\nextraordinary _Phænomena_, as are those of the Tides. Now this Paper\r\nhaving been drawn up for the late King _James_'s Use, (in whose Reign\r\nthe Book was publish'd) and having given good Satisfaction to those that\r\ngot Copies of it; it is hoped the Savans of the higher Form will indulge\r\nus this Liberty we take to gratifie their Inferiours in point of\r\nScience; and not be offended, that we here insist more largely upon Mr.\r\n_Newton_'s _Theory of the Tides_, which, how plain and easie soever we\r\nfind, is very little understood by the common Reader._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sole Principle upon which this Author proceeds to explain most of\r\nthe great and surprizing Appearances of Nature, is no other than that of\r\n_Gravity_, whereby in the Earth all Bodies have a tendency towards its\r\nCentre; as is most evident: And from undoubted Arguments it's proved,\r\nthat there is such a Gravitation towards the Centre of the Sun, Moon,\r\nand all the Planets.\r\n\r\nFrom this Principle, as a necessary Consequence, follows the Sphærical\r\nFigure of the Earth and Sea, and of all the other Cœlestial Bodies:\r\nAnd tho' the tenacity and firmness of the Solid Parts, support the\r\nInequalities of the Land above the Level; yet the Fluids, pressing\r\nequally and easily yielding to each other, soon restore the\r\n_Æquilibrium_, if disturbed, and maintain the exact Figure of the Globe.\r\n\r\nNow this force of Descent of Bodies towards the Centre, is not in all\r\nplaces alike, but is still less and less, as the distance from the\r\nCenter encreases: And in this Book it is demonstrated, that this Force\r\ndecreases as the Square of the distance increases; that is, the weight\r\nof Bodies, and the Force of their Fall is less, in parts more removed\r\nfrom the Center, in the proportion of the Squares of the Distance. So as\r\nfor Example, a Ton weight on the Surface of the Earth, if it were raised\r\nto the height of 4000 Miles, which I suppose the Semidiameter of the\r\nEarth, would weigh but ¼ of a Ton, or 5 Hundred weight: If to 12000\r\nMiles, or 3 Semidiameters from the Surface, that is 4 from the Center,\r\nit would weigh but 1/16 part of the Weight on the Surface, or a Hundred\r\nand Quarter: So that it would be as easie for the Strength of a Man at\r\nthat height to carry a Ton weight, as here on the Surface a 100¼. And\r\nin the same Proportion does the Velocities of the fall of Bodies\r\ndecrease: For whereas on the Surface of the Earth all things fall 16\r\nFoot in a second; at one Semidiameter above, this fall is but four Foot;\r\nand at three Semidiameters, or four from the Centre, it is but 1/16 of\r\nthe Fall at the Surface, or but one Foot in a second: And at greater\r\nDistances both Weight and Fall become very small, but yet at all given\r\nDistances is still some thing, tho' the Effect become insensible. At the\r\ndistance of the Moon (which I will suppose 60 Semidiameters of the\r\nEarth) 3600 Pounds weigh but one Pound, and the fall of Bodies is but of\r\n1/3600 a Foot in a second, or 16 Foot in a Minute; that is, a Body so\r\nfar off descends in a Minute no more than the same at the Surface of the\r\nEarth would do in a Second of Time.\r\n\r\nAs was said before, the same force decreasing after the same manner is\r\nevidently found in the Sun, Moon, and all the Planets; but more\r\nespecially in the Sun, whose Force is prodigious; becoming sensible even\r\nin the immense distance of _Saturn_: This gives room to suspect, that\r\nthe force of Gravity is in the Cœlestial Globes proportional to the\r\nquantity of Matter in each of them: And the Sun being at least ten\r\nThousand times as big as the Earth, its Gravitation or attracting Force,\r\nis found to be at least ten Thousand times as much as that of the Earth,\r\nacting on Bodies at the same distance.\r\n\r\nThis Law of the decrease of Gravity being demonstratively proved, and\r\nput past contradiction; the Author with great Sagacity, inquires into\r\nthe necessary Consequences of this Supposition; whereby he finds the\r\ngenuine Cause of the several Appearances in the Theory of the Moon and\r\nPlanets, and discovers the hitherto unknown Laws of the Motion of\r\nComets, and of the Ebbing and flowing of the Sea. Each of which are\r\nSubjects that have hitherto taken up much larger Volumes; but Truth\r\nbeing uniform, and always the same, it is admirable to observe how\r\neasily we are enabled to make out very abstruse _and difficult Matters_,\r\nwhen once true and genuine Principles are obtain'd: And on the other\r\nhand it may be wondred; that, notwithstanding the great facility of\r\ntruth, and the perplexity and nonconsequences that always attend\r\nerroneous Suppositions, these great Discoveries should have escaped the\r\nacute Disquisitions of the best Philosophical Heads of all past Ages,\r\nand be reserv'd to these our Times. But that wonder will soon cease, if\r\nit be consider'd how great improvements Geometry has receiv'd in our\r\nMemory, and particularly from the profound Discoveries of our\r\nincomparable Author.\r\n\r\nThe Theory of the Motion of the primary _Planets_ is here shewn to be\r\nnothing else, but the contemplation of the Curve Lines which Bodies cast\r\nwith a given Velocity, in a given Direction, and at the same time drawn\r\ntowards the Sun by its gravitating Power, would describe. Or, which is\r\nall one, that the Orbs of the Planets are such Curve Lines as a Shot\r\nfrom a Gun describes in the Air, being cast according to the direction\r\nof the Piece, but bent in a crooked Line by the supervening Tendency\r\ntowards the Earths Centre: And the Planets being supposed to be\r\nprojected with a given Force, and attracted towards the Sun, after the\r\naforesaid manner, are here proved to describe such Figures, as answer\r\npunctually to all that the Industry of this and the last Age has\r\nobserved in the Planetary Motions. So that it appears, that there is no\r\nneed of solid Orbs and Intelligences, as the Antients imagin'd, nor yet\r\nof _Vortices_ or Whirlpools of the Cœlestial Matter, as _Des Cartes_\r\nsupposes; but the whole Affair is simply and mechanically performed,\r\nupon the sole Supposition of a Gravitation towards the Sun; which cannot\r\nbe denied.\r\n\r\nThe Motion of _Comets_ is here shewn to be compounded of the same\r\nElements, and not to differ from Planets, but in their greater\r\nswiftness, whereby overpowering the Gravity that should hold them to the\r\nSun, as it doth the Planets, they flie off again, and distance\r\nthemselves from the Sun and Earth, so that they soon are out of our\r\nsight. And the imperfect Accounts and Observations Antiquity has left\r\nus, are not sufficient to determine whether the same Comet ever return\r\nagain. But this Author has shewn how Geometrically to determine the Orb\r\nof a Comet from Observations, and to find his Distance from the Earth\r\nand Sun, which was never before done.\r\n\r\nThe third thing here done is the Theory of the Moon, all the\r\nInequalities of whose Motion are proved to arise from the same\r\nPrinciples, only here the effect of two Centers operating on, or\r\nattracting a projected Body, comes to be considered; for the Moon,\r\nthough principally attracted by the Earth, and moving round it, does\r\ntogether with the Earth, move round the Sun once a Year, and is,\r\naccording as she is nearer or farther from the Sun, drawn by him more or\r\nless than the Center of the Earth, about which she moves; whence arise\r\nseveral Irregularities in her Motion, of all which, the Author in this\r\nBook, with no less Subtility than Industry, has given a full account.\r\nAnd though by reason of the great Complication of the Problem, he has\r\nnot yet been able to make it purely Geometrical, 'tis to be hoped, that\r\nin some farther Essay he may surmount the difficulty: And having\r\nperfected the Theory of the Moon, the long desir'd Discovery of the\r\nLongitude (which at Sea is only practicable this way) may at length be\r\nbrought to light, to the great Honour of your Majesty, and Advantage of\r\nyour Subjects.\r\n\r\nAll the surprising Phænomena of the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, are in\r\nlike manner shewn to proceed from the same Principle; which I design\r\nmore largely to insist on, since the Matter of Fact is in this Case much\r\nbetter known to your Majesty than in the foregoing.\r\n\r\nIf the Earth were alone, that is to say, not affected by the Actions of\r\nthe Sun and Moon, it is not to be doubted, but the Ocean, being equally\r\npress'd by the force of Gravity towards the Center, would continue in a\r\nperfect Stagnation, always at the same height, without either Ebbing or\r\nFlowing; but it being here demonstrated, that the Sun and Moon have a\r\nlike Principle of Gravitation towards their Centers, and that the Earth\r\nis within the Activity of their Attractions, it will plainly follow,\r\nthat the Equality of the pressure of Gravity towards the Center will\r\nthereby be disturb'd; and though the smallness of these Forces, in\r\nrespect of the Gravitation towards the Earth's Center, renders them\r\naltogether imperceptible by any Experiments we can devise, yet the Ocean\r\nbeing fluid and yielding to the least force, by its rising shews where\r\nit is less press'd, and where it is more press'd by its sinking.\r\n\r\nNow if we suppose the force of the Moon's Attaction to decrease as the\r\nSquare of the Distance from its Center increases (as in the Earth and\r\nother Cœlestial Bodies) we shall find, that where the Moon is\r\nperpendicularly either above or below the Horizon, either in Zenith or\r\nNadir, there the force of Gravity is most of all diminished, and\r\nconsequently that there the Ocean must necessarily swell by the coming\r\nin of the Water from those parts where the Pressure is greatest, _viz._\r\nin those places where the Moon is near the Horizon: But that this may be\r\nthe better understood, I thought it needful to add the following Figure,\r\n(_Vide Fig. 1. Plate 1._) where _M_ is the Moon, _E_ the Earth, _C_ its\r\nCenter, and _Z_ the place where the Moon is in the Zenith, _N_ where in\r\nthe Nadir.\r\n\r\nNow by the Hypothesis it is evident, that the Water in _Z_, being\r\nnearer, is more drawn by the Moon, than the Center of the Earth _C_, and\r\nthat again more than the Water in _N_; wherefore the Water in _Z_ hath a\r\ntendency towards the Moon, contrary to that of Gravity, being equal to\r\nthe excess of the Gravitation in _Z_, above that in _C_: And in the\r\nother case, the Water in _N_, tending less towards the Moon than the\r\nCenter _C_, will be less pressed, by as much as is the difference of the\r\nGravitation towards the Moon in _C_ and _N_. This rightly understood, it\r\nfollows plainly, that the Sea, which otherwise would be Spherical, upon\r\nthe Pressure of the Moon, must form it self into a Spheroidal or Oval\r\nFigure, whose longest Diameter is where the Moon is vertical, and\r\nshortest where she is in the Horizon; and that the Moon shifting her\r\nPosition as she turns round the Earth once a Day, this Oval of Water\r\nshifts with her, occasioning thereby the two Floods and Ebbs observable\r\nin each 25 Hours.\r\n\r\nAnd this may suffice, as to the general Cause of the Tides; it remains\r\nnow to shew how naturally this Motion accounts for all the Particulars\r\nthat have been observ'd about them; so that there can be no room left to\r\ndoubt, but that this is the true cause thereof.\r\n\r\nThe Spring Tides upon the New and Full Moons, and Neap Tides on the\r\nQuarters, are occasion'd by the attractive Force of the Sun in the New\r\nand Full, conspiring with the Attraction of the Moon, and producing a\r\nTide by their united Forces: Whereas in the Quarters, the Sun raises the\r\nWater where the Moon depresses it, and the contrary; so as the Tides are\r\nmade only by the difference of their Attractions. That the force of the\r\nSun is no greater in this Case, proceeds from the very small Proportion\r\nthe Semi-diameter of the Earth bears to the vast distance of the Sun.\r\n\r\nIt is also observ'd, that _cæteris paribus_, the Æquinoctial Spring\r\nTides in _March_ and _September_, or near them, are the Highest, and the\r\nNeap Tides the lowest; which proceeds from the greater Agitations of the\r\nWaters, when the fluid _Spheroid_ revolves about a great Circle of the\r\nEarth, than when it turns about in a lesser Circle; it being plain that\r\nif the Moon were constituted in the Pole, and there stood, that the\r\n_Spheroid_ would have a fix'd Position, and that it would be always high\r\nWater under the Poles, and low Water every where under the Æquinoctial:\r\nAnd therefore the nearer the Moon approaches the Poles, the less is the\r\nagitation of the Ocean, which is of all the greatest, when the Moon is\r\nin the Æquinoctial, or farthest distant from the Poles. Whence the Sun\r\nand Moon, being either conjoined or opposite in the Æquinoctial, produce\r\nthe greatest Spring Tides; and the subsequent Neap Tides, being produc'd\r\nby the Tropical Moon in the Quarters, are always the least Tides;\r\nwhereas in _June_ and _December_, the Spring Tides are made by the\r\nTropical Sun and Moon, and therefore less vigorous; and the Neap Tides\r\nby the Æquinoctial Moon, which therefore are the stronger: Hence it\r\nhappens, that the difference between the Spring and Neap Tides in these\r\nMonths, is much less considerable than in _March_ and _September_. And\r\nthe reason why the very highest Spring Tides are found to be rather\r\nbefore the Vernal and after the Autumnal Equinox, _viz._ in _February_\r\nand _October_, than precisely upon them, is, because the Sun is nearer\r\nthe Earth in the Winter Months, and so comes to have a greater effect in\r\nproducing the Tides.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have consider'd such Affections of the Tides as are\r\nUniversal, without relation to particular Cases; what follows from the\r\ndiffering Latitudes of places, will be easily understood by the\r\nfollowing Fig. (_Vide Fig. 2. Plate 1._)\r\n\r\nLet _ApEP_ be the Earth cover'd over with very deep Waters, _C_ its\r\nCenter, _P_, _p_, its Poles, _AE_ the Æquinoctial, _F_, _f_, the\r\nparallel of Latitude of a Place, _D_, _d_, another Parallel at equal\r\ndistance on the other side of the Æquinoctial, _H_, _h_, the two Points\r\nwhere the Moon is vertical, and let _K_, _k_, be the great Circle,\r\nwherein the Moon appears Horizontal. It is evident, that a Spheroid\r\ndescrib'd upon _Hh_, and _Kk_, shall nearly represent the Figure of the\r\nSea, and _Cf_, _CD_, _CF_, _Cd_, shall be the heighths of the Sea in the\r\nplaces _f_, _D_, _F_, _d_, in all which it is High-water: And seeing\r\nthat in twelve Hours time, by the diurnal Rotation of the Earth, the\r\nPoint _F_ is transferr'd to _f_, and _d_ to _D_: The height of the Sea\r\n_CF_ will be that of the High-water when the Moon is present, and _Cf_\r\nthat of the other High-water, when the Moon is under the Earth: Which in\r\nthe case of this Figure is less than the former _CF_. And in the\r\nopposite Parallel _Dd_, the contrary happens. The Rising of the Water\r\nbeing always alternately greater and less in each place, when it is\r\nproduc'd by the Moon declining sensibly from the Æquinoctial; that being\r\nthe greatest of the two High-waters in each diurnal Revolution of the\r\nMoon, wherein she approaches nearest either to the Zenith or Nadir of\r\nthe place: Whence it is, that the Moon in the Northern Signs, in this\r\npart of the World, makes the greatest Tides when above the Earth, and in\r\nSouthern Signs, when under the Earth; the Effect being always the\r\ngreatest where the Moon is farthest from the Horizon, either above or\r\nbelow it. And this alternate Increase and Decrease of the Tides has been\r\nobserv'd to hold true on the Coast of _England_, at _Bristol_ by Captain\r\n_Sturmy_, and at _Plymouth_ by Mr. _Colepresse_.\r\n\r\nBut the Motions hitherto mentioned are somewhat alter'd by the Libration\r\nof the Water, whereby, though the Action of the _Luminaries_ should\r\ncease, the Flux and Reflux of the Sea would for some time continue: This\r\nConservation of the impress'd Motion diminishes the differences that\r\notherwise would be between two consequent Tides, and is the reason why\r\nthe highest Spring-Tides are not precisely on the New and Full Moons,\r\nnor the Neaps on the Quarters; but generally they are the third Tides\r\nafter them, and sometimes later.\r\n\r\nAll these things would regularly come to pass, if the whole Earth were\r\ncover'd with Sea very deep; but by reason of the shoalness of some\r\nplaces, and the narrowness of the Streights, by which the Tides are in\r\nmany cases propagated, there arises a great diversity in the Effect, and\r\nnot to be accounted for, without an exact Knowledge of all the\r\nCircumstances of the Places, as of the Position of the Land, and the\r\nBreadth and Depth of the Channels by which the Tide flows; for a very\r\nslow and imperceptible Motion of the whole Body of the Water, where it\r\nis (for Example) 2 Miles deep, will suffice to raise its Surface 10 or\r\n12 Feet in a Tides time; whereas, if the same quantity of Water were to\r\nbe convey'd up a Channel of 40 Fathoms deep, it would require a very\r\ngreat Stream to effect it, in so large Inlets as are the Channel of\r\n_England_, and the _German_ Ocean; whence the Tide is found to set\r\nstrongest in those places where the Sea grows narrowest; the same\r\nquantity of Water being to pass through a smaller Passage: This is most\r\nevident in the _Streights_, between _Portland_ and _Cape de Hague_ in\r\n_Normandy_, where the Tide runs like a Sluce; and would be yet more\r\nbetween _Dover_ and _Calais_, if the Tide coming about the Island from\r\nthe North did not check it. And this force being once impress'd upon the\r\nWater, continues to carry it above the level of the ordinary height in\r\nthe Ocean, particularly where the Water meets a direct Obstacle, as it\r\nis at St. _Malo's_; and where it enters into a long Channel, which\r\nrunning far into the Land, grows very streight at its Extremity; as it\r\nis in the _Severn-Sea_ at _Chepstow_ and _Bristol_.\r\n\r\nThis shoalness of the Sea, and the intercurrent Continents are the\r\nreason, that in the open Ocean the time of High water is not at the\r\nMoons appulse to the Meridian, but always some Hours after it; as it is\r\nobserv'd upon all the West Coast of _Europe_ and _Africa_, from\r\n_Ireland_ to the _Cape of Good Hope_: In all which a S. W. Moon makes\r\nHigh-water, and the same is reported to be on the West side of\r\n_America_. But it would be endless to account all the particular\r\nSolutions, which are easie Corollaries of this _Hypothesis_; as why the\r\n_Lakes_, such as the _Caspian Sea_, and _Mediterranean Seas_, such as\r\nthe _Black Sea_, the _Streights_ and _Baltick_, have no sensible Tides:\r\nFor _Lakes_ having no Communication with the Ocean, can neither increase\r\nnor diminish their Water, whereby to rise and fall; and Seas that\r\ncommunicate by such narrow Inlets, and are of so immense an Extent,\r\ncannot in a few Hours time receive or empty Water enough to raise or\r\nsink their Surface any thing sensibly.\r\n\r\nLastly, to demonstrate the Excellency of this Doctrine, the Example of\r\nthe Tides in the Port of _Tunking_ in _China_, which are so\r\nextraordinary, and differing from all others we have yet heard of, may\r\nsuffice. In this Port there is but one Flood and Ebb in 24 Hours; and\r\ntwice in each Month, _viz._ when the Moon is near the Æquinoctial there\r\nis no Tide at all, but the Water is stagnant; but with the Moons\r\nDeclination there begins a Tide, which is greatest when she is in the\r\nTropical Signs: Only with this difference, that when the Moon is to the\r\nNorthward of the Æquinoctial, it Flows when she is above the Earth, and\r\nEbbs when she is under, so as to make High-water at Moons-setting, and\r\nLow-water at Moons-rising: But on the contrary, the Moon being to the\r\nSouthward, makes High-water at rising, and Low-water at setting; it\r\nEbbing all the time she is above the Horizon. As may be seen more at\r\nlarge in the _Philosophical Transactions_, Numb. 162.\r\n\r\nThe Cause of this odd Appearance is propos'd by Mr. _Newton_, to be from\r\nthe concurrence of two Tides; the one propagated in six Hours out of the\r\ngreat _South-Sea_ along the Coast of _China_; the other out of the\r\n_Indian-Sea_, from between the Islands in twelve Hours, along the Coast\r\nof _Malacca_ and _Cambodia_. The one of these Tides, being produc'd in\r\nNorth Latitude, is, as has been said, greater, when the Moon being to\r\nthe North of the Equator is above the Earth, and less when she is under\r\nthe Earth. The other of them, which is propagated from the _Indian Sea_,\r\nbeing raised in South-Latitude, is greater when the Moon declining to\r\nthe South, is above the Earth, and less when she is under the Earth: So\r\nthat of these Tides alternately greater and lesser, there comes always\r\nsuccessively two of the greater and two of the lesser together every\r\nDay; and the High-water falls always between the times of the arrival of\r\nthe two greater Floods; and the Low-water between the arrival of the two\r\nlesser Floods. And the Moon coming to the Æquinoctial, and the alternate\r\nFloods becoming equal, the Tide ceases, and the Water stagnates: But\r\nwhen she has pass'd to the other side of the Equator, those Floods which\r\nin the former Order were the least, now becoming the greatest, that That\r\nbefore was the time of High-water, now becomes the Low-water, and the\r\nConverse. So that the whole appearance of these strange Tides, is\r\nwithout any forcing naturally deduc'd from these Principles, and is a\r\ngreat Argument of the Certainty of the whole _Theory_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A Theory of the _Variation_ of the _Magnetical Compass_. By Mr. _Ed.\r\n   Halley_, Fellow of the Royal Society._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Variation of the Compass (by which I mean the Deflection of the\r\nMagnetical Needle from the true Meridian) is of that great Concernment\r\nin the Art of Navigation, that the neglect thereof, does little less\r\nthan render useless one of the noblest Inventions Mankind ever yet\r\nattained to. And for this cause all Ships of Consequence (especially\r\nthose bound beyond the Equator) carry with them Instruments on purpose\r\nto observe this Variation: That so the Course steer'd by the Compass,\r\nmay be reduc'd to the true Course in respect of the Meridian.\r\n\r\nNow although the great utility that a perfect Knowledge of the Theory of\r\nthe Magnetical Direction would afford to Mankind in general, and\r\nespecially to those concern'd in Sea Affairs, seems as sufficient\r\nincitement to all Philosophical and Mathematical Heads, to take under\r\nserious Consideration the several _Phænomena_, and to endeavour to\r\nreconcile them by some general Rule: Yet so it is; that almost all the\r\nAuthors, from whom a Discourse of this kind ought to have been expected,\r\npass by in silence the Difficulties they here Encounter. And those that\r\nmention this Variation: By affirming it to proceed from Causes\r\naltogether uncertain (as are the casual lying of Iron Mines and\r\nLoadstones in the Earth) put a stop to all further Contemplation; and\r\ngive discouragement to those that would otherwise undertake this\r\nEnquiry. 'Tis true, that not long since one Mr. _Bond_, an old Teacher\r\nof Navigation, put forth a small Treatise, wherein he pretends to\r\ncalculate the Variation: But he limits his Hypothesis to the City of\r\n_London_, affirming himself (as he had a great deal of reason) that the\r\nsame _Calculus_ is not sufficient for other Places; whereby it appears\r\nthat this Rule is far short of the so much desir'd general one.\r\n\r\nNow although (through want of sufficient Observations, and some other\r\nDifficulties, which I shall anon shew) I cannot pretend perfectly to\r\nestablish the Numbers and Rules of a _Calculus_, which shall precisely\r\nanswer to the Variations of all parts of the World: Yet I suppose it\r\nwill not be unacceptable to the Curious to propose something of a Light\r\ninto this abstruse Mystery; which, if no other, may have this good\r\nEffect, to stir up the Philosophical _Genii_ of the Age to apply\r\nthemselves more attentively to this useful Speculation. But before I\r\nproceed, 'twill be necessary to lay down the Grounds upon which I raise\r\nmy Conclusions; and at once to give a Synopsis of those Variations,\r\nwhich I have reason to look upon as sure, being mostly the Observations\r\nof Persons of good Skill and Integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TABLE OF VARIATIONS.\r\n\r\n        _Names of            | _Longitude |_Latitude._| _Anno | _Variation\r\n         Places._            |  from_ Lon.|           |  Dom._|  Observ'd._\r\n                             |            |           |       |\r\n                             |  _d_ _m_   |  _d_ _m_  |       | _d_ _m_\r\n _London_                    |   0   0    |  51  32 N |  1580 | 11  15 E\r\n                             |            |           |  1622 |  6   0 E\r\n                             |            |           |  1634 |  4   5 E\r\n                             |            |           |  1672 |  2  30 W\r\n _Paris_                     |   2  25 E  |  48  51 N |  1683 |  4  30 W\r\n                             |            |           |  1640 |  3  00 E\r\n                             |            |           |  1666 |  0   0\r\n                             |            |           |  1681 |  2  30 W\r\n _Uraniburg_                 |  13   0 E  |  55  54 N |  1672 |  2  35 W\r\n ----------------------------+------------+-----------+-------+------------\r\n _Copenhagen_                |  12  53 E  |  55  41 N |  1649 |  1  30 E\r\n                             |            |           |  1672 |  3  35 W\r\n _Dantzick_                  |  19   0 E  |  54  23 N |  1679 |  7  00 W\r\n _Mompelier_                 |   4   0 E  |  43  37 N |  1674 |  1  10 W\r\n _Brest_                     |   4  25 W  |  48  23 N |  1680 |  1  45 W\r\n ----------------------------+------------+-----------+-------+------------\r\n _Rome_                      |  13   0 E  |  41  50 N |  1681 |  5   0 W\r\n _Bayonne_                   |   1  20 W  |  43  30 N |  1680 |  1  20 W\r\n _Hudson's_ Bay              |  79  40 W  |  51  00 N |  1668 | 19  15 W\r\n In _Hud._ Straights         |  57  00 W  |  61  00 N |  1668 | 29  30 W\r\n In _Baffin's_ Bay at  }     |            |           |       |\r\n   Sir _Thomas Smith's_}     |  80  00 W  |  78  00 N |  1616 | 57  00 W\r\n   Sound               }     |            |           |       |\r\n ----------------------------+------------+-----------+-------+-----------\r\n At Sea                      |  50   0 W  |  38  40 N |  1682 |  7  30 W\r\n At Sea                      |  31  30 W  |  43  50 N |  1682 |  5  30 W\r\n At Sea                      |  42   0 W  |  21   0 N |  1678 |  0  40 E\r\n Cape St. _Aug._ of _Brazile_|  35  30 W  |   8   0 S |  1670 |  5  30 E\r\n Cape _Frio_                 |  41  10 W  |  22  40 S |  1670 | 12  10 E\r\n ----------------------------+------------+-----------+-------+------------\r\n At Sea off of the Mou.    } |            |           |       |\r\n of the River _Plate_      } |  53  00 W  |  39  30 S |  1670 | 20  33 E\r\n At the East Entrance   }    |            |           |       |\r\n of _Magellan_ Straits  }    |  68  00 W  |  52  30 S |  1670 | 17  00 E\r\n At the W.

But first we must make some Remarks upon the\r\nforegoing Table: And, First,\r\n\r\nThat in all _Europe_ the Variation at this time is West, and more in the\r\nEastern Parts thereof than the Western: As likewise, that it seems\r\nthroughout to be upon the increase that way.\r\n\r\nSecondly, That on the Coast of _America_, about _Virginia_,\r\n_New-England_ and _New-Foundland_, the Variation is likewise Westerly;\r\nand that it increases all the way as you go Northerly along the Coast,\r\nso as to be above 20 Degrees at _New-Found-Land_, nearly 30 gr. in\r\n_Hudson's Straights_, and not less than 57 Degrees in _Baffin's Bay_;\r\nalso, that as you Sail Eastward from this Coast, the Variation\r\ndiminishes. From these two it is a Legitimate Corollary: That _Somewhere\r\nbetween_ Europe, _and the North part of_ America, _there ought to be an\r\nEasterly Variation, or at least no Westerly_. And so I conjecture it is\r\nabout the Eastermost of the _Tercera Islands_.\r\n\r\nThirdly, That on the Coast of _Brasile_ there is East Variation, which\r\nincreases very notably as you go to the Southward, so as to be 12\r\nDegrees at _Cape Frio_, and over against the River of _Plate_ 20½\r\nDegrees: And from thence Sailing South-Westerly to the Straits of\r\n_Magellan_ it decreases 17 Degrees, and at the West Entrance but 14\r\nDegrees.\r\n\r\nFourthly, That at the Eastward of _Brasile_, properly so call'd, this\r\nEasterly Variation decreases, so as to be very little at St. _Helena_\r\nand _Ascension_, and to be quite gone, and the Compass Point true about\r\n18 Degrees of Longitude West from the Cape of _Good-hope_.\r\n\r\nFifthly, That to the Eastward of the aforesaid Places a Westward\r\nVariation begins, which Reigns in the whole _Indian_ Sea, and arises to\r\nno less than Eighteen Degrees under the Equator it self, about the\r\nMeridian of the Northern part of _Madagascar_; and near the same\r\nMeridian, but in 39 Degrees South Latitude it is found full 27½\r\nDegrees: From thence Easterly the West Variation decreases, so as to be\r\nlittle more than eight Degrees at _Cape Comorin_, and than three Degrees\r\nupon the Coast of _Java_; and to be quite extinct about the _Molucca\r\nIslands_, as also a little to the Westwards of _Van Diemens_ Land found\r\nout by the _Dutch_ in 1642.\r\n\r\nSixthly, That to the Eastward of the _Molucca's_ and _Van Diemens_ Land\r\nin South Latitude there arises another Easterly Variation, which seems\r\nnot so great as the former, nor of so large Extent; for that at the\r\nIsland _Rotterdam_ it is sensibly less than upon the East Coast of _New\r\nGuinea_; and, at the rate it decreases, it may well be suppos'd, that\r\nabout 20 Degrees farther East, or 225 Degrees East Longitude from\r\n_London_, in the Latitude of 20 Degrees South, a Westerly Variation\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, That the Variations observ'd by the Honourable Sir _John\r\nNorborough_ at _Baldivia_, and at the West Entrance of the _Straights_\r\nof _Magellan_ do plainly shew, that That East Variation, noted in our\r\nthird Remark, is decreasing apace; and that it cannot reasonably extend\r\nmany Degrees into the South Sea from the Coast of _Peru_ and _Chili_,\r\nleaving room for a small Westerly Variation, in that Tract of the\r\nunknown World that lies in the mid-way between _Chili_ and\r\n_New-Zealand_, and between _Hounds-Island_ and _Peru_.\r\n\r\nEighthly, That in Sailing North-West from St. _Helena_ by _Ascension_,\r\nas far as the Equator, the Variation continues very small East, and as\r\nit were constantly the same: So that in this part of the World the\r\nCourse, wherein there is no Variation, is evidently no Meridian, but\r\nrather North-West.\r\n\r\nNinthly, That the Entrance of _Hudson's Straights_, and the Mouth of the\r\nRiver of _Plate_, being nearly under the same Meridian, at the one place\r\nthe Needle varies 29½ Degrees to the _West_; at the other 20½\r\nDegrees to the _East_. This plainly demonstrates the impossibility of\r\nreconciling these Variations by the Theory of _Bond_; _which is by two\r\nMagnetical Poles and an Axis, inclin'd to the Axis of the Earth_; from\r\nwhence it would follow, That _under the same Meridian the Variation\r\nshould be in all places the same way_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese things being premised may serve as a sure Foundation to raise the\r\nSuperstructure of a Theory upon. But first it would not be amiss to shew\r\nhereby the mistake of _Gilbert_ and _Des Cartes_: The first whereof\r\nsupposes, that _the Earth it self being in all its parts Magnetical, and\r\nthe Water not; wheresoever the Land is, thither also should the Needle\r\nturn, as to the greater quantity of Magnetical Matter_. But this in many\r\nInstances is not true; but most remarkably upon the Coast of _Brazile_,\r\nwhere the Needle is so far from being attracted by the Land, that it\r\nturns the quite contrary way, leaving the Meridian to lye N b E, which\r\nis just along the Coast. As to the Position of _Des Cartes_, _that the\r\nIron and Loadstones hid in the Bowels of the Earth and the Bottom of the\r\nSea, may be the Causes that the Needle varies_; if we consider for how\r\ngreat a part of the Earths Surface, _ex. gr._ in the whole _Indian_ Sea,\r\nthe Needle declines the same way, and that regularly, 'twill follow that\r\nthe attracting Substance that occasions it, must be very far distant.\r\nNow by Experience we find the little force that Iron Guns have upon the\r\nCompass in Ships (their Vertue, though they be Demiculverin, or greater\r\nCannon, being not perceptible at four or five Yards distance) and the\r\nExperiments now before the _Royal Society_ do plainly shew, how little a\r\nMagnetism there is in most crude Iron Oars: What quantity thereof must\r\nbe then suppos'd to make so powerful a Diversion at two or three\r\nThousand Miles distance? Yet I cannot deny that in some places near the\r\nShoar, or in Shoal-Water, the Needle may be irregularly directed from\r\nthe aforesaid Causes, and that not a little, as _Gassendus_ gives a\r\nnotable instance of the Island _Elba_ in the Mediterranean Sea: But\r\nthese differences from the general Direction are always signs of the\r\nnearness of those Magnetical Substances, for the Production whereof that\r\nIsland _Elba_ has been famous from all Antiquity. Besides, against both\r\n_Des Cartes_ and _Gilbert_, the change of the Variation, which has been\r\nwithin these Hundred Years last past more than 15 gr. at _London_, is an\r\nentire Demonstration; tho' _Des Cartes_ does not stick to say, that the\r\ntransportation of Iron from place to place, and the growth of new Iron\r\nwithin the Earth, where there was none before, may be the cause thereof.\r\nThe same holds likewise against the _Hypothesis_ of _Magnetical Fibres_,\r\nwhich _Kircher_ maintains.\r\n\r\nNow to propose something that may answer the several appearances, and\r\nintroduce nothing strange in Philosophy, after a great many close\r\nThoughts, I can come to no other Conclusion than that, _The whole Globe\r\nof the Earth is one great Magnet, having four Magnetical Poles, or\r\nPoints of Attraction, near each Pole of the Equator. Two; and that, in\r\nthose parts of the World which lie near adjacent to any one of those\r\nMagnetical Poles, the Needle is govern'd thereby, the nearest Pole being\r\nalways predominant over the more remote_. The parts of the Earth wherein\r\nthese Magnetical _Poles_ lie, cannot as yet be exactly determin'd for\r\nwant of sufficient _Data_ to proceed Geometrically; but, as near as\r\nConjecture can reach, I reckon that the _Pole_, which is at present\r\nnearest to us, lies in or near the Meridian of the Lands-end of\r\n_England_, and not above seven Degrees from the Pole Arctick; by this\r\n_Pole_ the Variations in all _Europe_ and _Tartary_, and the _North Sea_\r\nare principally govern'd, though with regard to the other Northern Pole,\r\nwhose situation is in a _Meridian_ passing about the middle of\r\n_California_, and about 15 gr. from the North Pole of the World; to this\r\nthe Needle has chiefly respect in all the North _America_, and in the\r\ntwo Oceans on either side thereof, from the _Azores_ Westward to\r\n_Japan_, and farther. The two Southern Poles are rather farther distant\r\nfrom the South Pole of the World: The one about sixteen Degrees\r\ntherefrom, is in a Meridian, some twenty Degrees to the Westward of\r\n_Magellan Straights_, or ninety five Degrees West from _London_: This\r\ncommands the Needle in all the _South-America_, in the _Pacifick Sea_,\r\nand the greatest part of the _Ethiopick_ Ocean. The Fourth and last\r\n_Pole_ seems to have the greatest Power, and largest Dominions of all,\r\nas it is the most remote from the _Pole_ of the World, being little less\r\nthan 20 Degrees distant therefrom in the Meridian, which passes through\r\n_Hollandia Nova_, and the Island _Celebes_ about one hundred and twenty\r\nDegrees East from _London_; this Pole is predominant in the South part\r\nof _Africa_, in _Arabia_ and the _Red Sea_, in _Persia_, _India_, and\r\nits Islands, and all over the _Indian Sea_, from the Cape of _Good-Hope_\r\nEastwards to the middle of the great South Sea, that divides _Asia_ from\r\n_America_. This seems to be the present Disposition of the Magnetical\r\nVertue throughout the whole Globe of the Earth; it remains to shew how\r\nthis Hypothesis makes out all the Variations that have been observ'd of\r\nlate; and how it answers to our several Remarks drawn from the Table.\r\nAnd first it is plain, that (our _European_ North _Pole_ being in the\r\nMeridian of the Lands-end of _England_) all places more Easterly than\r\nthat will have it on the West side of their Meridian, and consequently\r\nthe Needle, respecting it with its Northern Point, will have a Westerly\r\nVariation, which will still be greater as you go to the Eastwards, till\r\nyou come to some Meridian of _Russia_, where 'twill be greatest, and\r\nfrom thence decrease again. Thus at _Brest_ the Variation is but 1¾\r\nDegrees, at _London_ 4½ Degrees; but at _Dantzick_ seven Degrees\r\nWest. To the Westward of the Meridian of the Lands-end, the Needle ought\r\nto have an Easterly Variation; were it not that (by approaching the\r\n_American_ Northern _Pole_, which lies on the West side of the Meridian,\r\nand seems to be of greater force than this other) the Needle is drawn\r\nthereby Westwards, so as to counterballance the Direction given by the\r\n_European Pole_, and to make a small West Variation in the Meridian of\r\nthe Lands-end it self. Yet I suppose that about the Meridian of the Isle\r\n_Tercera_, our nearest _Pole_ may so far prevail as to give the Needle a\r\nlittle turn to the East, though but for a very small space: The\r\nCounterballance of those two _Poles_ permitting no considerable\r\nVariation in all the Eastern Parts of the _Atlantick_ Ocean; nor upon\r\nthe West Coasts of _England_ and _Ireland_, _France_, _Spain_ and\r\n_Barbary_. But to the Westwards of the _Azores_ the Power of the\r\n_American_ Pole overcoming that of the _European_, the Needle has\r\nchiefly respect thereto, and turns still more and more towards it as you\r\napproach it. Whence it comes to pass, that on the Coast of _Virginia_,\r\n_New-England_, _New-found-Land_, and in _Hudson's-Straights_ the\r\nVariation is Westward; that it decreases as you go from thence towards\r\n_Europe_, and that it is less in _Virginia_ and _New-England_, than in\r\n_New-found-Land_, and _Hudson's-Straights_. This Westerly Variation\r\nagain decreases, as you pass over the _North America_; and about the\r\nMeridian of the middle of _California_ the Needle again points due\r\nNorth; and from thence Westward to _Yedzo_ and _Japan_, I make no doubt\r\nbut the Variation is Easterly, and half the Sea over no less than\r\nfifteen Degrees, if there be any truth in this Hypothesis of mine.\r\nTherefore I propose this as a Trial, that the whole may be scann'd\r\nthereby; and I conceive it will not be hard to know of the _Spaniards_\r\nhow it is, who so frequently sail through that Ocean, in their return\r\nfrom the _Manilha_ Isles. This East Variation extends over _Japan_,\r\n_Yedzo_, _East-Tartary_, and part of _China_, till it meet with the\r\nWesterly, which is govern'd by the _European_ North Pole, and which I\r\nsaid was greatest some where in _Russia_.\r\n\r\nTowards the Southern Pole the effect is much the same, only that here\r\nthe South Point of the Needle is attracted. Hence it will follow, that\r\nthe Variation on the Coast of _Brazile_, at the River of _Plate_, and so\r\non to the Straights of _Magellan_, should be Easterly (as in our third\r\nRemark); if we suppose a Magnetical Pole situate about twenty Degrees\r\nmore Westerly than the Straights of _Magellan_. And this Easterly\r\nVariation doth extend Eastward over the greatest part of the _Ethiopick_\r\nSea, till it be counterpoised by the Vertue of the other Southern\r\n_Pole_; as it is about mid-way between the Cape of _Good-Hope_, and the\r\nIsles of _Tristan d' Acuntia_. From thence Eastwards, the _Asian_ South\r\nPole (as I must take the liberty to call it) becoming prevalent, and the\r\nSouth point of the Needle being attracted thereby, there arises a West\r\nVariation, very great in quantity and extent, because of the great\r\ndistance of this Magnetical Pole of the World. Hence it is, that in all\r\nthe _Indian_ Sea as far as _Hollandia Nova_, and farther, there is\r\nconstantly West Variation; at that under the Equator it self it arises\r\nto no less than eighteen Degrees, where 'tis most. About the Meridian of\r\nthe Island _Celebes_, being likewise that of this Pole, this Westerly\r\nVariation ceases, and an Easterly begins; which reaches, according to my\r\nHypothesis, to the middle of the _South-Sea_, between _Zelandia Nova_,\r\nand _Chili_, leaving room for a small _West Variation_ govern'd by the\r\n_American_ South Pole, which I shew'd to be in the _Pacifick Sea_, in\r\nthe sixth and seventh Remark.\r\n\r\nWhat I have now said, does plainly shew the sufficiency of this\r\nHypothesis for solving the Variations that are at this time observ'd in\r\nthe temperate and frigid _Zones_, where the Direction of the Needle\r\nchiefly depends upon the Counterpoise of the forces of two Magnetical\r\nPoles of the same Nature; and I suppose I have shewn how it comes to\r\npass, that under the same Meridian the Variation should be in one place\r\n29½ West, and another 20½ East; as I have noted in my ninth Remark.\r\n\r\nIn the _Torrid Zone_, and particularly under the Equinoctial, respect\r\nmust be had to all four Poles, and their Positions well consider'd,\r\notherwise it will not be easie to determine what the Variations shall\r\nbe; the nearest _Pole_ being always the strongest; yet not so, as not to\r\nbe counterballanc'd sometimes by the united forces of two more remote; a\r\nnotable Instance whereof is in our eighth Remark, where I took notice,\r\nthat in sailing from St. _Helena_ by the Isle of _Ascension_, to the\r\nEquator, on a N. W. Course, the Variation is very little Easterly, and\r\nin that whole Tract unalterable; for which I give this Reason, That the\r\nSouth _American_ Pole (which is considerably the nearest in the\r\naforesaid Places) requiring a great Easterly Variation, is counterpoised\r\nby the contrary Attraction of the _North-American_ and the\r\n_Asian-South-Pole_; each whereof singly are in these Parts, weaker than\r\nthe _American-South-Pole_; and upon the North West Course, the Distance\r\nfrom this latter is very little varied; and as you recede from the\r\n_Asian-South-Pole_, the Ballance is still preserv'd by the access\r\ntowards the _North-American-Pole_. I mention not in this Case the\r\n_European-North-Pole_, its Meridian being little remov'd from those of\r\nthese places; and of it self requiring the same Variations we here find.\r\nAfter the same manner we might proceed to conclude the Variations in\r\nother places under and near the Equator; but I purposely leave it for an\r\nExercise to the Thoughts of the serious Reader, who is desir'd to help\r\nhis Imagination, by having before him a Map or Globe of the Earth: And\r\nto mark thereon the Magnetical _Poles_ in the _Longitudes_ and\r\n_Latitudes_ I assign them. (_Vide Plate 2._)\r\n\r\nThus, I hope, I have not lost my Pains and Study in this difficult\r\nSubject; believing that I have put it past doubt, _That there are in the\r\nEarth four such Magnetical Points or Poles, which occasion the great\r\nvariety and seeming irregularity which is observed in the Variations of\r\nthe Compass_. But to calculate exactly what it is, in any place\r\nassign'd, is what I dare not yet pretend to, though I could wish it were\r\nmy happiness to be able to oblige the World with so useful a piece of\r\nKnowledge; there are Difficulties that occur, that render the thing as\r\nyet not feasible; for first there are a great many Observations\r\nrequisite, which ought to be made at the same time; not at Sea, but\r\nashore, with greater Care and Attention than the generality of Sailors\r\napply. And besides, it remains undetermin'd in what proportion the\r\nattractive Power decreases, as you remove from the _Pole_ of a Magnet,\r\nwithout which it were a vain attempt to go about to calculate. There is\r\nyet a further Difficulty, which is the Change of the Variation, one of\r\nthe Discoveries of this last Century; which shews, that it will require\r\nsome hundreds of Years to establish a compleat Doctrine of the\r\nMagnetical System. From the foregoing Table it should seem, that all the\r\nMagnetical _Poles_ had a motion Westward: But if it be so, 'tis evident,\r\nthat it is not a Rotation about the Axis of the Earth; for then the\r\nVariations would continue the same, in the same parallel of _Latitude_\r\n(the _Longitude_ only chang'd) as much as is the motion of the\r\nMagnetical _Poles_, but the contrary is found by Experience; for there\r\nis no where in the Latitude of 15½ North between _England_ and\r\n_America_, a Variation of eleven Degrees East at this time; as it was\r\nonce here at _London_; it seems therefore, that our _European_ Pole is\r\ngrown nearer the Pole _Arctick_ than it was heretofore, or else that it\r\nhas lost part of its Vertue. But whether these Magnetical Poles move\r\naltogether with one motion, or with several; whether equally or\r\nunequally; whether Circular or Libratory: If Circular, about what\r\nCenter; if Libratory, after what manner; are Secrets as yet utterly\r\nunknown to Mankind, and are reserv'd for the Industry of future Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An Account of the Cause of the Change of the Variation of the\r\n   Magnetical Needle, with an Hypothesis of the Structure of the\r\n   Internal Parts of the Earth; as it was proposed to the _Royal\r\n   Society_ in one of their late Meetings. By Mr. _Edmund Halley_._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving in the precedent Discourse delivered a Theory of the Variation of\r\nthe Magnetical Compass, wherein I did collect as many Observations as at\r\nthat time I could procure, and having carefully compar'd them together,\r\nI came at length to this general conclusion, _That the Globe of the\r\nEarth might be supposed to be one great Magnet, having four Magnetical\r\nPoles or Points of Attraction, near each Pole of the Equator two; and\r\nthat in those parts of the World which lie near adjacent to any one of\r\nthose Magnetical Poles, the Needle is chiefly govern'd thereby; the\r\nnearest Pole being always predominant ever the more remote_. And I there\r\nhave endeavour'd to state and limit the present Position of those Poles\r\nin the Surface of our Globe, which the Reader pleasing to consult, will\r\nsave us the pains of repeating. But after all, tho' that Discourse was\r\nfavourably receiv'd both at home and abroad, as seeming to render a\r\ntolerable account of the observ'd Variations, yet I found two\r\nDifficulties not easie to surmount; the one was, that no Magnet I had\r\never seen or heard of, had more than two opposite _Poles_, whereas the\r\nEarth had visibly four, and perhaps more. And secondly, it was plain\r\nthat these _Poles_ were not, at least all of them, fixt in the Earth,\r\nbut shifted from place to place, as appear'd by the great Changes in the\r\nNeedles Direction within this last Century of Years, not only at\r\n_London_, (where this great Discovery was first made) but almost all\r\nover the Globe of Earth; whereas it is not known or observ'd that the\r\n_Poles_ of a Load-stone ever shifted their place in the Stone, nor\r\n(considering the compact hardness of that Substance) can it easily be\r\nsuppos'd; though the Matter of Fact be too notorious and universal, not\r\nto be accounted for.\r\n\r\nThese Difficulties had wholly made me despond, and I had long since\r\ngiven over an Inquiry I had so little hopes of, when in accidental\r\nDiscourse, and least expecting it, I stumbl'd on the following\r\nHypothesis; in delivering whereof, if I shall seem to advance any thing\r\nthat looks like Extravagant or Romantick, the Reader is desir'd to\r\nsuspend his Censure, till he have consider'd the force and number of the\r\nmany Arguments which concur to make good so new and so bold a\r\nSupposition.\r\n\r\nThough it be sufficiently known and allow'd, that the Needles Variation\r\nchanges, it will be necessary however to give a few Instances, whereby\r\nit may appear that this Change is gradual and universal, and the effect\r\nof a great and permanent motion: For which take the following Examples.\r\n\r\nAt _London_, in the Year 1580, the Variation was observ'd by Mr.\r\n_Burrows_ to be 11° 15' East. In _Anno_ 1622, the same was found by Mr.\r\n_Gunter_ to be but 6° 0' East. In the Year 1634, Mr. _Gellibrand_ found\r\nit 4° 5' East. In 1657, Mr. _Bond_ observ'd that there was no Variation\r\nat _London_. _Anno_ 1672, my self observ'd it 2° 30' to the West; and in\r\nthe Year 1692, I again found it 6° 00' West. So that in 112 Years the\r\nDirection of the Needle has chang'd no less than seventeen Degrees.\r\n\r\nAt _Paris_, _Orontius Finæus_ about the Year 1550, did account it about\r\neight or nine Degrees East Variation. _Anno_ 1640, it was found three\r\nDegrees East. _Anno_ 1660, there was no Variation there, and _Anno_\r\n1681, I found it to be 2° 30' to the West.\r\n\r\nAt _Cape d' Agulhas_, the most Southerly Promontary of _Africa_, about\r\nthe Year 1600, the Needle pointed due North and South without Variation,\r\nwhence the _Portugueze_ gave its name. _Anno_ 1622, there was two\r\nDegrees West Variation. _Anno_ 1675, it was 8° 50' West; and in the Year\r\n1691, it was curiously observ'd not less than eleven Degrees West.\r\n\r\nAt St. _Helena_, about the Year 1600, the Needle declin'd eight Degrees\r\nto the East. _Anno_ 1623, it was but 6° 0' East. _Anno_ 1677, when I was\r\nthere, I observ'd it accurately on Shoar to be 0° 40' East; and in 1692\r\nit was found about 1° to the Westward of the North.\r\n\r\nAt _Cape Comorine_ in _India_, in the Year 1620, there was 14° 20' West\r\nVariation. In the Year 1680, there was 8° 48', but now lately in the\r\nYear 1688, it was no more than 7° 30', so that here the Needle has\r\nreturn'd to the East about seven Degrees in seventy Years.\r\n\r\nIn all the other Examples the Needle has gradually mov'd towards the\r\nWest, and the places are too far asunder to be influenc'd by the removal\r\nof any Magnetical Matter, which may by accident be transplac'd within\r\nthe Bowels, or on the Surface of the Earth. If more Examples are\r\ndesir'd, the Reader may be furnished with them in the _Portugueze\r\nRoutier_ of _Aleixo de Motta_ (written about the Year 1600) and in the\r\nVoyage of _Beaulieu_, both publish'd in Mr. _Thevenot_'s first\r\nCollection of curious Voyages, Printed at _Paris_, _Anno_ 1663; which he\r\nis to compare with the Journals of our late _East India_ Voyagers, and I\r\nam assur'd, that it will be thereby evident, that the Direction of the\r\nNeedle is in no place fix'd and constant, tho' in some it change faster\r\nthan in others: And where for a long time it has continu'd as it were\r\nunalter'd, it is there to be understood, that the Needle has its\r\ngreatest Deflection, and is become Stationary in order to return, like\r\nthe Sun, in the Tropick. This, at present, is in the _Indian Sea_, about\r\nthe Island _Mauritius_, where is the highest West Variation, and in a\r\nTract tending from thence into the N. N. W. towards the _Red-Sea_ and\r\n_Egypt_. And in all Places to the Westward of this Tract, all over\r\n_Africa_ and the Seas adjoining, the West Variation will be found to\r\nhave encreas'd; and to the Eastwards thereof as in the Example of _Cape\r\nComorine_, to have decreased, _viz._ all over the _East-Indies_, and the\r\nIslands near it.\r\n\r\nAfter the like manner in that Space of East Variation, which, beginning\r\nnear St. _Helena_, is found all over the South _America_, and which at\r\npresent is highest about the Mouth of _Rio de la Plata_, it has been\r\nobserv'd, that in the Eastern Parts thereof, the Variation of the Needle\r\ngradually decreases; but whether on the contrary it increases in those\r\nplaces which lie more Westerly than that Tract wherein the highest East\r\nVariation is found; or how it may be in the vast _Pacifick Sea_, we have\r\nnot Experience enough to ascertain, only we may by Analogy infer, that\r\nboth the East and West Variations therein do gradually increase and\r\ndecrease after the same Rule.\r\n\r\nThese _Phænomena_ being well understood and duly consider'd, do\r\nsufficiently evince, That the whole Magnetical System is by one, or\r\nperhaps more motions translated, whether Eastwards or Westwards, I shall\r\nanon discuss; that this moving thing is very great, as extending its\r\neffects from Pole to Pole, and that the motion thereof is not _per\r\nsaltum_, but a gradual and regular motion.\r\n\r\nNow considering the Structure of our _Terraqueous_ Globe, it cannot be\r\nwell suppos'd that a very great part thereof can move within it, without\r\nnotably changing its Center of Gravity and the Equilibre of its Parts,\r\nwhich would produce very wonderful Effects in changing the Axis of\r\ndiurnal Rotation, and occasion strange alteration in the Seas Surface,\r\nby Inundations and Recesses thereof, such as History never yet\r\nmention'd. Besides, the solid parts of the Earth are not to be granted\r\npermeably by any other than fluid Substances, of which we know none that\r\nare any ways Magnetical. So that the only way to render this motion\r\nintelligible and possible, is to suppose it to turn about the Center of\r\nthe Globe, having its Center of Gravity fix'd and immoveable in the same\r\ncommon Center of the Earth: And there is yet requir'd, that this moving\r\ninternal Substance be loose and detached from the external Parts of the\r\nEarth whereon we live; for otherwise, were it affix'd thereto, the whole\r\nmust necessarily move together.\r\n\r\nSo then the External Parts of the Globe may well be reckon'd as the\r\nShell, and the Internal as a _Nucleus_ or inner Globe, included within\r\nours, with a fluid Medium between, which having the same Common Center\r\nand Axis of diurnal Rotation, may turn about with our Earth each twenty\r\nfour Hours; only this outer Sphere having its turbinating motion some\r\nsmall matter either swifter or slower than the internal Ball: And a very\r\nminute Difference in length of time, by many Repetitions becoming\r\nsensible, the Internal Parts will by degrees recede from the External,\r\nand not keeping pace with one another, will appear gradually to move\r\neither Eastwards or Westwards by the difference of their motions.\r\n\r\nNow supposing such an Internal Sphere having such a motion, we shall\r\nsolve the two great Difficulties we encounter'd in my former Hypothesis:\r\nFor if this exteriour Shell of Earth be a Magnet, having its Poles at a\r\ndistance from the Poles of diurnal Rotation; and if the Internal\r\n_Nucleus_ be likewise a Magnet, having its Poles in two other places,\r\ndistant also from the Axis; and these latter by a gradual and slow\r\nmotion change their place in respect of the External; we may then give a\r\nreasonable account of the four Magnetical Poles I presume to have\r\ndemonstrated before; as likewise of the Changes of the Needles\r\nVariations, which till now hath been unattempted.\r\n\r\nThe Period of this Motion being wonderful great, and there being hardly\r\nan hundred Years since these Variations have been duly observ'd, it will\r\nbe very hard to bring this Hypothesis to a Calculus, especially since,\r\nthough the Variations do increase and decrease regularly in the same\r\nplace, yet in differing places, at no great distance, there are found\r\nsuch casual Changes thereof as can no ways be accounted for by a regular\r\nHypothesis; as depending upon the unequal and irregular distribution of\r\nthe Magnetical Matter within the Substance of the External Shell or Coat\r\nof the Earth, which deflect the Needle from the Position it would\r\nacquire from the effect of the general Magnetism of the whole. Of this\r\nthe Variations at _London_ and _Paris_ give a notable Instance, for the\r\nNeedle has been constantly about 1°½ more Easterly at _Paris_ than at\r\n_London_; though it be certain that according to the general effect, the\r\nDifference ought to be the contrary way: Notwithstanding which, the\r\nVariations in both places do change alike.\r\n\r\nHence, and from some other of like Nature, I conclude, That the two\r\nPoles of the External Globe are fixt in the Earth, and that if the\r\nNeedle were wholly govern'd by them, the Variations thereof would be\r\nalways the same, with some little Irregularities upon the account I but\r\njust now mention'd: But the Internal Sphere having such a gradual\r\ntranslation of its Poles, does influence the Needle, and direct it\r\nvariously, according to the result of the attractive or directive Power\r\nof each Pole; and consequently there must be a Period of the Revolution\r\nof this Internal Ball, after which the Variations will return again as\r\nbefore. But if it shall in future Ages be observ'd otherwise, we must\r\nthen conclude that there are more of these Internal Spheres, and more\r\nMagnetical Poles than Four, which at present we have not a sufficient\r\nnumber of Observations to determine, and particularly in that vast _Mar\r\ndel Zur_, which occupies so great a part of the whole Surface of the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nIf then two of the Poles be fixt and two moveable, it remains to\r\nascertain which they are that keep their place; and though I could wish\r\nwe had the Experience of another Century of Years to found our\r\nConclusions upon, yet I think we may safely determine, That our\r\n_European North Pole_ (which in the precedent Discourse I suppos'd near\r\nthe Meridian of the Lands-end of _England_, and about seven Degrees\r\ntherefrom) is that That is moveable of the two Northern Poles, and that\r\nThat has chiefly influenc'd the Variations in these parts of the World:\r\nFor in _Hudson_'s Bay, which is under the Direction of the _American_\r\nPole, the Change is not observ'd to be near so fast as in these parts of\r\n_Europe_, though that Pole be much farther remov'd from the Axis.\r\n\r\nAs to the South Poles, I take the _Asian_ Pole, which I place about the\r\nMeridian of the Island _Celebes_ to be the fixt, and consequently the\r\n_American_ Pole to move; from the like Observation of the slow Decrease\r\nof the Variation on the Coast of _Java_, and near the Meridian of the\r\n_Asian_ Pole; though I must confess to have no account of the effects of\r\nthe other beyond _Magellan_'s Streights.\r\n\r\nIf this be allow'd me, 'tis plain that the fixt Poles are the Poles of\r\nthis External Shell or Cortex of the _Earth_, and the other two the\r\nPoles of a Magnetical _Nucleus_ included and moveable within the other.\r\nIt likewise follows, that this Motion is Westwards, and by consequence\r\nthat the aforesaid _Nucleus_ has not precisely attained the same degree\r\nof Velocity with the exteriour Parts in their diurnal Revolution; but so\r\nvery nearly equals it, that in 365 Revolves the difference is scarce\r\nsensible. This I conceive to arise from the Impulse whereby this diurnal\r\nMotion was imprest on the Earth, being given to the External Parts, and\r\nfrom thence in time communicated to the Internal; but not so as\r\nperfectly to equal the Velocity of the first Motion impress'd on, and\r\nstill conserv'd by the superficial Parts of the Globe.\r\n\r\nAs to the quantity of this Motion it is almost impossible to define it,\r\nboth from the Nature of this kind of Observation, which cannot be very\r\naccurately perform'd, as also from the small time these Variations have\r\nbeen observ'd, and their Change discover'd. It appears by all\r\nCircumstances, that its Period is of many Centuries of Years, and as far\r\nas may be collected from the Change of the Place, where there was no\r\nVariation, by reason of the Equilibre of the two Southern Magnetical\r\nPoles, _viz._ from _Cape d' Agulhas_ to the Meridian of St. _Helena_\r\n(which is about 23 _degr._ in about ninety Years) and of the place where\r\nthe Westerly Variation is in its ἀκμὴ or greatest Deflection, being\r\nabout half so much, _viz._ from the Isle of _Diego Roiz_ to the South\r\nWest Parts of _Madagascar_. We may with some Reason conjecture, that the\r\n_American_ Pole has mov'd Westwards forty six Degrees in that time, and\r\nthat the whole Period thereof is perform'd in seven hundred Years, or\r\nthereabouts; so that the nice Determination of this, and of several\r\nother Particulars in the Magnetick System is reserv'd for remote\r\nPosterity; all that we can hope to do, is to leave behind us\r\nObservations that may be confided in, and to propose an Hypothesis which\r\nafter Ages may examine, amend or refute. Only here I must take leave to\r\nrecommend to all Masters of Ships, and all others, Lovers of Natural\r\nTruths, that they use their utmost Diligence to make, or procure to be\r\nmade, Observations of these Variations in all parts of the World, as\r\nwell in the North as South Latitude (after the laudable Custom of our\r\n_East India_ Commanders) and that they please to communicate them to the\r\n_Royal Society_, in order to leave as compleat a History as may be to\r\nthose that are hereafter to compare all together, and to compleat and\r\nperfect this abstruse Theory.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way it will not be amiss to amend a receiv'd Error in the\r\nPractice of observing the Variation, which is, to take it by the\r\nAmplitude of the Rising and Setting Sun, when his Center appears in the\r\nvisible Horizon; whereas he ought to be observ'd when his under Limb is\r\nstill above the Horizon about ⅔ of his Diameter, or twenty Minutes,\r\nupon the score of the Refraction, and the height of the Eye of the\r\nObserver above the Surface of the Sea: Or else they are to work the\r\nAmplitudes as they do the Azimuth, reckoning the Suns Distance from the\r\nZenith 90° 36': This, though it be of little consequence near the\r\nÆquinoctial, will make a great Error in high Latitudes, where the Sun\r\nrises and sets obliquely.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our Hypothesis, In order to explain the Change of the\r\nVariations, we have adventur'd to make the Earth hollow, and to place\r\nanother Globe within it; and I doubt not but this will find Opposers\r\nenough. I know 'twill be Objected, That there is no Instance in Nature\r\nof the like thing; that if there was such a middle Globe it would not\r\nkeep its place in the Center, but be apt to deviate therefrom, and might\r\npossibly chock against the Concave Shell, to the ruin, or at least\r\nendammaging thereof; That the Water of the Sea would perpetually leak\r\nthrough, unless we suppose the Cavity full of Water; That were it\r\npossible, yet it does not appear of what use such an inward Sphere can\r\nbe of, being shut up in Eternal Darkness, and therefore unfit for the\r\nProduction of Animals or Plants; with many more Objections, according to\r\nthe Fate of all such new Propositions.\r\n\r\nTo these, and all other that I can foresee, I briefly Answer, That the\r\nRing environing the Globe of _Saturn_ is a notable Instance of this\r\nkind, as having the same common Center, and moving along with the\r\nPlanet, without sensibly approaching him on one side more than the\r\nother. And if this Ring were turn'd on one of its Diameters, it would\r\nthen describe such a Concave Sphere as I suppose our External one to be.\r\nAnd since the Ring, in any Position given, would, in the same manner,\r\nkeep the Centre of _Saturn_ in its own, it follows, that such a Concave\r\nSphere may move with another included in it, having the same common\r\nCentre. Nor can it well be suppos'd otherwise, considering the Nature of\r\nGravity; for should these Globes be adjusted once to the same common\r\nCentre, the Gravity of the parts of the Concave would press equally\r\ntowards the Centre of the inner Ball, which equality must necessarily\r\ncontinue till some External Force disturb it, which is not easie to\r\nimagine in our Case. This perhaps I might more intelligibly express, by\r\nsaying that the inner Globe being posited in the Centre of the\r\nExteriour, must necessarily ascend which way soever it move; that is, it\r\nmust overcome the force of Gravity pressing towards the common Centre,\r\nby an impulse it must receive from some outward Agent; but all outward\r\nEfforts being sufficiently fenc'd against by the Shell that surrounds\r\nit, it follows, that this _Nucleus_ being once fixt in the common\r\nCentre, must always there remain.\r\n\r\nAs to the leaking of the Water through this Shell, when once a passage\r\nshall be found for it to run through, I must confess it is an Objection\r\nseemingly of weight; but when we consider how tightly great Beds of\r\nChalk or Clay, and much more Stone do hold Water, and even Caves arch'd\r\nwith Sand; no Man can doubt but the Wisdom of the Creator has provided\r\nfor the Macrocosm by many more ways than I can either imagine or\r\nexpress, especially since we see the admirable and innumerable\r\nContrivances wherewith each worthless Individual is furnish'd both to\r\ndefend it self, and propagate its Species. What Curiosity in the\r\nStructure, what Accuracy in the Mixture and Composition of the parts,\r\nought not we to expect in the Fabrick of this Globe, made to be the\r\nlasting Habitation of so many various Species of Animals, in each of\r\nwhich there want not many Instances that manifest the boundless Power\r\nand Goodness of their Divine Author; and can we then think it a hard\r\nSupposition, that the Internal Parts of this Bubble of Earth should be\r\nreplete with such Saline and Vitriolick Particles as may contribute to\r\nPetrefaction, and dispose the transuding Water to shoot and coagulate\r\ninto Stone, so as continually to fortifie, and, if need were, to\r\nconsolidate any breach or flaw in the Concave Surface of the Shell.\r\n\r\nAnd this perhaps may not without Reason be suppos'd to be the final\r\nCause of the admixture of the Magnetical Matter in the Mass of the\r\nTerrestrial parts of our Globe, _viz._ To make good and maintain the\r\nConcave Arch of this Shell: For by what the Excellent Mr. _Newton_ has\r\nshewn in his _Principia Philosophiæ_, it will follow, that according to\r\nthe general Principle of Gravity, visible throughout the whole Universe,\r\nall those Particles that by length of time, or otherwise, shall moulder\r\naway, or become loose on the Concave Surface of the External Sphere,\r\nwould fall in, and with great force descend on the Internal, unless\r\nthose Particles were of another sort of Matter capable by their stronger\r\ntendency to each other, to suspend the force of Gravity; but we know no\r\nother Substances capable of supporting each other by their mutual\r\nAttraction but the Magnetical, and these we see miraculously to perform\r\nthat Office, even where the Power of Gravity has its full effect, much\r\nmore within the Globe where it is weaker. Why then may we not suppose\r\nthese said Arches to be lin'd throughout with a Magnetical Matter, or\r\nrather to be one great Concave Magnet, whose two Poles are the Poles we\r\nhave before observ'd to be fixt in the Surface of our Globe.\r\n\r\nAnother Argument, favouring this Hypothesis, is drawn from a Proposition\r\nof the same Mr. _Newton_, where he determines the force wherewith the\r\n_Moon_ moves the _Sea_ in producing the _Tides_: His Words are,\r\n_Densitas Lunæ est ad densitatem Terra ut 680 ad 387 seu 9 ad 5\r\nquamproximé. Est igitur corpus Lunæ densius ac magis terrestre quam\r\nTerra nostra_, p. 466. Now if the Moon be more solid than the Earth, as\r\n9 to 5, why may we not reasonably suppose the Moon, being a small Body,\r\nand a secondary Planet, to be solid Earth, Water, Stone, and this Globe\r\nto consist of the same Materials, only four Ninths thereof to be Cavity,\r\nwithin and between the Internal Spheres; which I would render not\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nTo those that shall enquire of what use these included Globes can be, it\r\nmust be allow'd, that they can be of very little service to the\r\nInhabitants of this outward World, nor can the Sun be serviceable to\r\nthem, either with his Light or Heat. But since it is now taken for\r\ngranted, that the Earth is one of the Planets, and they all are with\r\nReason suppos'd Habitable, though we are not able to define by what sort\r\nof Animals; and since we see all the parts of the Creation abound with\r\nAnimate Beings, as the Air with Birds and Flies, the Water with the\r\nnumerous varieties of Fish, and the very Earth with Reptiles of so many\r\nsorts; all whose ways of Living would be to us incredible did not daily\r\nExperience teach us. Why then should we think it strange that the\r\nprodigious Mass of Matter, whereof this Globe does consist, should be\r\ncapable of some other improvement than barely to serve to support its\r\nSurface? Why may not we rather suppose that the exceeding small quantity\r\nof solid Matter, in respect of the fluid Æther, is so dispos'd by the\r\nAlmighty Wisdom, as to yield as great a Surface for the use of living\r\nCreatures, as can consist with the conveniency and security of the\r\nwhole? We our selves, in Cities where we are pressed for Room, commonly\r\nbuild many Stories one over the other, and thereby accommodate a much\r\ngreater multitude of Inhabitants.\r\n\r\nBut still it will be said, That without Light there can be no living,\r\nand therefore all this _apparatus_ of our inward Globes must be useless:\r\nTo this I Answer, That there are many ways of producing Light which we\r\nare wholly ignorant of; the Medium it self may be always luminous after\r\nthe manner of our _Ignes fatui_. The Concave Arches may in several\r\nplaces shine with such a Substance as invests the Surface of the Sun;\r\nnor can we, without a boldness unbecoming a Philosopher, adventure to\r\nassert the impossibility of peculiar Luminaries below, of which we have\r\nno sort of _Idea_. I am sure the Poets _Virgil_ and _Claudian_ have gone\r\nbefore me in this Thought, inlightning their _Elysian Fields_ with Sun\r\nand Stars proper to those infernal, or rather internal Regions. _Virg.\r\nÆneid. 6._\r\n\r\n  _Largior hic compos Æther & lumine vestit\r\n  Purpureo; Solemque suum sua Sidera norunt._\r\n\r\nAnd _Claudian lib 2. De Raptu Proserpinæ._\r\n\r\n  _Amissum ne crede diem, sunt altera nobis\r\n  Sidera, sunt orbes alii, luménque videbis\r\n  Purius, Elysiumque magis mirabere Solem._\r\n\r\nAnd though this be not to be esteem'd as an Argument, yet I may take the\r\nliberty I see others do, to quote the Poets when it makes for my purpose.\r\n\r\nLastly, To explain yet farther what I mean, I have adventur'd to adjoin\r\nthe following Scheme, (_Tab. 1. Fig. 3_) wherein the Earth is\r\nrepresented by the outward Circle, and the three inward Circles are made\r\nnearly proportionable to the Magnitudes of the Planets _Venus_, _Mars_\r\nand _Mercury_, all which may be included within the Globe of Earth, and\r\nall the Arches more than sufficiently strong to bear their weight. The\r\nConcave of each Arch, which is shaded differently from the rest, I\r\nsuppose to be made up of Magnetical Matter; and the whole to turn about\r\nthe same common Axis _pp_, only with this difference, that the Outer\r\nSphere still moves somewhat faster than the Inner. Thus the Diameter of\r\nthe Earth being about eight thousand _English_ Miles, I allow five\r\nhundred Miles for the thickness of its Shell, and another space of five\r\nhundred Miles for a Medium between, capable of an immense Atmosphere for\r\nthe use of the Globe of _Venus_: _Venus_ again I give a Shell of the\r\nsame thickness, and leave as great a space between her Concave and\r\n_Mars_; so likewise from _Mars_ to _Mercury_, which latter Ball we will\r\nsuppose solid, and about two thousand Miles Diameter. Thus I have shew'd\r\na possibility of a much more ample Creation, than has hitherto been\r\nimagin'd; and if this seem strange to those that are unacquainted with\r\nthe Magnetical System, it is hop'd that all such will endeavour, first,\r\nto inform themselves of the Matter of Fact, and then try if they can\r\nfind out a more simple Hypothesis, at least a less absurd, even in their\r\nown Opinions. And whereas I have adventur'd to make these Subterraneous\r\nOrbs capable of being Inhabited, 'twas done designedly for the sake of\r\nthose who will be apt to ask _cui bono_, and with whom Arguments drawn\r\nfrom _Final Causes_ prevail much. If this short Essay shall find a kind\r\nAcceptance, I shall be encourag'd to enquire farther, and to Polish this\r\nrough Draft of a Notion till hitherto not so much as started in the\r\nWorld, and of which we could have no Intimation from any other of the\r\n_Phænomena_ of Nature.\r\n\r\nSince this was written, a Discovery I have made in the Cœlestial\r\nMotions, seems to render a farther Account of the Use of the Cavity of\r\nthe Earth, _viz._ To diminish the Specifick Gravity thereof, in respect\r\nof the Moon; for I think I can demonstrate that the Opposition of the\r\nÆther to the Motions of the Planets in long time becomes sensible; and\r\nconsequently the greater Body must receive a less Opposition than the\r\nsmaller, unless the Specifick Gravity of the smaller do proportionably\r\nexceed that of the greater, in which case only they can move together;\r\nso that the Cavity I assign in the Earth, may well serve to adjust its\r\nweight to that of the Moon, for otherwise the Earth would leave the Moon\r\nbehind it, and she become another Primary Planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An Historical Account of the _Trade Winds_ and _Monsoons_, observable\r\n   in the Seas between and near the _Tropicks_, with an attempt to\r\n   assign the Physical Cause of the said Winds, by Mr. _Ed. Halley_._\r\n\r\n\r\nAn exact Relation of the constant and periodical Winds, observable in\r\nseveral Tracts of the Ocean, is a part of Natural History not less\r\ndesireable and useful, than it is difficult to obtain, and its\r\n_Phænomena_ hard to explicate: I am not ignorant that several Writers\r\nhave undertaken this Subject, and although _Varenius_ (_Lib. 1. Chap.\r\n21. Geo. Gen._) seems to have endeavour'd after the best information\r\nfrom _Voyagers_, yet cannot his Accounts be admitted for accurate, by\r\nthose that shall attentively consider and compare them together, and\r\nsome of them are most evident Mistakes; which, as near as I can, I shall\r\nattempt to rectify, having had the opportunity of conversing with\r\nNavigators, acquainted with all parts of _India_, and having liv'd a\r\nconsiderable time between the _Tropicks_, and there made my own Remarks.\r\n\r\nThe Substance of what I have collected is briefly as follows.\r\n\r\nThe Universal _Ocean_ may most properly be divided into three Parts,\r\n_viz._ 1. The _Atlantick_ and _Æthiopick-Sea_. 2. The _Indian Ocean_.\r\n3. The Great _South Sea_, or the _Pacifick Ocean_; and though these Seas\r\ndo all communicate by the South, yet as to our present purpose of the\r\n_Trade Winds_, they are sufficiently separated by the interposition of\r\ngreat Tracts of _Land_; the first lying between _Africa_ and _America_,\r\nthe second between _Africa_ and the _Indian Islands_, and _Hollandia\r\nNova_; and the last between the _Phillipine Isles_, _China_, _Japan_ and\r\n_Hollandia Nova_ on the _West_, and the Coast of _America_ on the\r\n_East_. Now following this natural division of the Seas, so will we\r\ndivide our History into three parts in the same order.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. In the _Atlantick_ and _Æthiopick_ Seas between the _Tropicks_, there\r\nis a general _Easterly Wind_ all the Year long, without any considerable\r\nVariation, excepting that it is subject to be deflected therefrom, some\r\nfew Points of the Compass towards the _North_ or _South_, according to\r\nthe Position of the place. The Observations which have been made of\r\nthese Deflections, are the following.\r\n\r\n1. That near the Coast of _Africa_, as soon as you have pass'd the\r\n_Canary Isles_, you are sure to meet a fresh Gale of _North East_ Wind,\r\nabout the Latitude of 28 Degrees _North_, which seldom comes to the\r\n_Eastwards_ of the _East North-East_, or passes the _North North-East_.\r\nThis Wind accompanies those bound to the Southward, to the Latitude of\r\nten North, and about a hundred Leagues from the _Guinea_ Coast, where,\r\ntill the fourth Degree of North Latitude, they fall into the Calms and\r\nTornadoes; of which more hereafter.\r\n\r\n2. That those bound to the _Caribbee Isles_, find, as they approach the\r\n_American_ side, that the aforesaid _North-East_ Wind becomes still more\r\nand more Easterly, so as sometimes to be _East_, sometimes _East_ by\r\n_South_, but yet most commonly to the _Northward_ of the _East_ a Point\r\nor two, seldom more. 'Tis likewise observ'd, that the strength of these\r\nWinds does gradually decrease, as you sail to the _Westwards_.\r\n\r\n3. That the limits of the Trade and variable Winds, in this Ocean, are\r\nfarther extended on the _American_ side than the _African_; for whereas\r\nyou meet not with this certain Wind till after you have pass'd the\r\nLatitude of twenty eight Degrees on this side; on the _American_ side it\r\ncommonly holds to thirty, thirty one, or thirty two Degrees of Latitude;\r\nand this is verified likewise to the Southwards of the Æquinoctial, for\r\nnear the _Cape_ of _Good-Hope_ the limits of the Trade Winds, are three\r\nor four Degrees nearer the Line, than on the Coast of _Brazile_.\r\n\r\n4. That from the Latitude of four Degrees _North_, to the aforesaid\r\nLimits on the _South_ of the Æquator, the Winds are generally and\r\nperpetually between the _South_ and _East_, and most commonly between\r\nthe _South-East_ and _East_, observing always this Rule, That on the\r\n_African_ side they are more _Southerly_, on the _Brazilian_ more\r\n_Easterly_, so as to become almost due _East_, the little deflection\r\nthey have being still to the _Southwards_. In this part of the Ocean it\r\nhas been my fortune to pass a full Year, in an Employment that oblig'd\r\nme to regard more than ordinary the Weather, and I found the Winds\r\nconstantly about the _South-East_, the most usual Point _S E b E_; when\r\nit was Easterly, it generally blew hard, and was gloomy, dark, and\r\nsometimes rainy Weather; if it came to the Southwards it was generally\r\nSerene, and a small Gale next to a Calm, but this not very common. But I\r\nnever saw it to the Westwards of the South, or Northwards of the East.\r\n\r\n5. That the Season of the Year has some small effect on these Trade\r\nWinds, for that when the Sun is considerable to the Northwards of the\r\nÆquator, the South-East Winds, especially in the Straight of this Ocean\r\n(if I may so call it) between _Brazile_ and the Coast of _Guinea_, do\r\nvary a Point or two to the Southwards, and the North-East become more\r\nEasterly; and on the contrary, when the Sun is towards the Tropick of\r\n_Capricorn_ the South-Easterly Winds become more Easterly, and the\r\nNorth-Easterly Winds on this side the Line veere more to the Northwards.\r\n\r\n6. That as there is no general Rule that admits not of some Exception,\r\nso there is in this Ocean a Tract of Sea wherein the Southerly and\r\nSouth-West Winds are perpetual, _viz._ all along the Coast of _Guinea_,\r\nfor above five hundred Leagues together, from _Sierra Leona_ to the Isle\r\nof St. _Thomas_; for the South-East Trade Wind having pass'd the Line,\r\nand approaching the Coast of _Guinea_ within eighty or 100 Leagues,\r\ninclines towards the Shore, and becomes S. S. E. and by Degrees, as you\r\ncome nearer, it veeres about to South, S. S. W. and in with the Land\r\nSouth-West, and sometimes West South-West; which Variation is better\r\nexpress'd in the Mapp hereto annexed, (_Vide Plate 2_) than it can well\r\nbe in Words. These are the Winds which are observ'd on this Coast when\r\nit blows true, but there are frequent Calms, violent sudden Gusts call'd\r\n_Tornado's_, from all Points of the Compass, and sometimes unwholsome\r\nfoggy Easterly Winds, call'd _Hermitaa_ by the Natives, which too often\r\ninfest the Navigation of these parts.\r\n\r\n7. That to the Northwards of the Line, between four and ten Degrees of\r\nLatitude, and between the Meridians of _Cape Virde_, and of the\r\nEastermost Islands that bear that Name, there is a Tract of Sea wherein\r\nit were improper to say there is any Trade Wind, or yet a Variable; for\r\nit seems condemn'd to perpetual Calms, attended with terrible Thunder\r\nand Lightning, and Rains so frequent, that our Navigators from thence\r\ncall this part of the Sea the _Rains_; the little Winds that are, be\r\nonly some sudden uncertain Gusts, of very little Continuance and less\r\nExtent; so that sometimes each Hour you shall have a different Gale,\r\nwhich dies away into a Calm before another succeed, and in a Fleet of\r\nShips in sight of one another, each shall have the Wind from a several\r\nPoint of the Compass; with these weak _Breezes_ Ships are oblig'd to\r\nmake the best of their way to the Southward through the aforesaid six\r\nDegrees, wherein 'tis reported some have been detain'd whole Months for\r\nwant of Wind.\r\n\r\nFrom the three last Observables is shewn the Reason of two notable\r\nOccurents in the _East-India_ and _Guinea_ Navigations: The one is, why,\r\nnotwithstanding the narrowest part of the Sea between _Guinea_ and\r\n_Brazile_ be about five hundred Leagues over, yet Ships bound to the\r\nSouthward, sometimes, especially in the Months of _July_ and _August_,\r\nfind a great difficulty to pass it. This happens because of the\r\nSouth-East Winds, at that time of the Year commonly extending some\r\nDegrees beyond the ordinary limit of four Degrees North Latitude, and\r\nwithal they come so much Southerly, as to be sometimes South, sometimes\r\na Point or two to the West; there remains then only to ply to Windward,\r\nand if on the one side they stand away W. S. W. they gain the Wind still\r\nmore and more Easterly; but there is danger of not weathering the\r\n_Brazilian_ Shoar, or at least the Shoals upon that Coast. But if upon\r\nthe other Tack they go away E. S. E. they fall into the Neighbourhood of\r\nthe Coast of _Guinea_, from which there is no departing without running\r\nEasterly, as far as the Isle of St. _Thomas_, which is the constant\r\npractice of all the _Guinea_ Ships, and which may seem very strange,\r\nwithout the consideration of the sixth Remark, which shews the Reason of\r\nit: For being in with the Coast, the Wind blows generally at S. W. and\r\nW. S. W. with which Winds they cannot go to the Northward for the Land;\r\nand on the other Tack they can lie no nearer the Wind than S. S. E. or\r\nSouth; with these Courses they run off the Shoar, but in so doing they\r\nalways find the Winds more and more contrary; so that when near the\r\nShoar they could lie South, at a greater distance they can make their\r\nway no better than S. E. and afterwards E. S. E. with which Courses they\r\nfetch commonly the Isle of St. _Thomas_ and Cape _Lopez_, where finding\r\nthe Winds to the Eastward of the South, they keep them favourable, by\r\nrunning away to the Westward in the South Latitude, of three or four\r\nDegrees, where the S. E. Winds are perpetual.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of these general Winds, all those that use the\r\n_West-Indian_ Trade, even those bound to _Virginia_, count it their best\r\nCourse to get as soon as they can to the Southwards, that so they may be\r\ncertain of a fair and fresh Gale to run before it to the Westwards; and\r\nfor the same Reason those homewards bound from _America_, endeavour to\r\ngain the Latitude of thirty Degrees, as soon as possible, where they\r\nfirst find the Winds begin to be variable; tho' the most ordinary Winds\r\nin the Northern part of the _Atlantick_ Ocean come from between the\r\nSouth and West.\r\n\r\nAs to those furious Storms call'd _Hurricanes_, which are, as it were,\r\npeculiar to the _Caribbee_ Isles; and which so dreadfully afflict them\r\nin the Month of _August_, or not much before or after, they do not so\r\nproperly belong to this place, both by Reason of their small continuance\r\nand extent, as likewise because they are not Anniversary, some Years\r\nhaving more than one, and sometimes for several Years together there\r\nbeing none at all. But their Violence is so unconceivable, and their\r\nother _Phænomena_ so surprising, that they merit well to be consider'd\r\napart.\r\n\r\nWhat is here said, is to be understood of the Sea Winds at some distance\r\nfrom the Land; for upon and near the Shoars, the Land and Sea Breezes\r\nare almost every where sensible; and the great Variety which happens in\r\ntheir Periods, Force and Direction, from the situation of the Mountains,\r\nVallies and Woods, and from the various Texture of the Soil, more or\r\nless capable of retaining and reflecting Heat, and of exhaling or\r\ncondensing Vapours, is such, that it were an endless task, to endeavour\r\nto account for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. In the _Indian_ Ocean, the Winds are partly general, as in the\r\n_Æthiopick_ Ocean, partly Periodical; that is, half the Year they blow\r\none way, and the other half near upon the opposite Points; and these\r\nPoints and Times of shifting are different in different parts of this\r\nOcean; the limits of each Tract of Sea, subject to the same Change or\r\n_Monsoon_, are certainly very hard to determine, but the diligence I\r\nhave used to be rightly inform'd, and the care I have taken therein,\r\nhas, in a great measure, surmounted that Difficulty; and I am perswaded\r\nthat the following Particulars may be relied upon.\r\n\r\n1. That between the Latitudes of ten Degrees and thirty Degrees South,\r\nbetween _Madagascar_ and _Hollandia Nova_, the general Trade Wind about\r\nthe S. E. by E. is found to blow all the Year long, to all Intents and\r\nPurposes after the same manner as in the same Latitudes in the\r\n_Æthiopick_ Ocean, as it is describ'd in the fourth _Remark_ aforegoing.\r\n\r\n2. That the aforesaid S. E. Winds extend to within two Degrees of the\r\n_Æquator_, during the Months of _June_, _July_, _August_, &c. to\r\n_November_; at which time between the _South Latitudes_ of three and ten\r\nDegrees, being near the Meridian of the North end of _Madagascar_, and\r\nbetween two and twelve South Latitude, being near _Sumatra_ and _Java_,\r\nthe contrary Winds from the N. W. or between the North and West, set in\r\nand blow for half the Year, _viz._ from the beginning of _December_ till\r\n_May_; and this _Monsoon_ is observ'd as far as the _Molucca_ Isles, of\r\nwhich more anon.\r\n\r\n3. That to the Northward of three Degrees South Latitude, over the whole\r\n_Arabian_ or _Indian-Sea_ and Gulph of _Bengall_, from _Sumatra_ to the\r\nCoast of _Africa_, there is another _Monsoon_, blowing from _October_ to\r\n_April_ upon the North East Points; but in the other half Year, from\r\n_April_ to _October_, upon the opposite Points of S. W. and W. S. W. and\r\nthat with rather more force than the other, accompanied with dark rainy\r\nWeather, whereas the N. E. blows clear; 'tis likewise to be noted, that\r\nthe Winds are not so constant, either in strength or point in the Gulph\r\nof _Bengall_, as they are in the _Indian-Sea_, where a certain and\r\nsteady Gale scarce ever fails. 'Tis also remarkable, that the S. W.\r\nWinds in these Seas are generally more Southerly on the _African_ side,\r\nmore Westerly on the _Indian_.\r\n\r\n4. That as an _Appendix_ to the last describ'd _Monsoon_, there is a\r\nTract of Sea to the Southwards of the Æquator, subject to the same\r\nChanges of the Winds, _viz._ near the _African_ Coast, between it and\r\nthe Island _Madagascar_ or St. _Lawrence_, and from thence Northwards as\r\nfar as the Line; wherein from _April_ to _October_ there is found a\r\nconstant fresh S. S. W. Wind, which, as you go more Northerly, becomes\r\nstill more and more Westerly, so as to fall in with the W. S. W. Winds,\r\nmention'd before, in those Months of the Year to be certain to the\r\nNorthward of the Æquator: What Winds blow in these Seas, for the other\r\nhalf Year, from _October_ to _April_, I have not yet been able to obtain\r\nto my full satisfaction, for that our Navigators always return from\r\n_India_ without _Madagascar_, and so are little acquainted in this\r\nMatter; the Account that has been given me is only this, that the Winds\r\nare much Easterly hereabouts, and as often to the North of the true East\r\nas to the Southwards thereof.\r\n\r\n5. That to the Eastward of _Sumatra_ and _Malacca_, to the Northwards of\r\nthe Line, and along the Coast of _Cambodia_ and _China_, the _Monsoons_\r\nblow North and South, that is to say, the N. E. Winds are much\r\nNortherly, and the S. W. much Southerly: This Constitution reaches to\r\nthe Eastwards of the _Philippine_ Isles, and as far Northerly as\r\n_Japan_. The Northern _Monsoon_ setting in, in these Seas, in _October_\r\nor _November_, and the Southern in _May_, blowing all the Summer Months:\r\nHere it is to be noted, That the Points of the Compass, from whence the\r\nWind comes in these Parts of the World, are not so fixt as in those\r\nlately describ'd; for the Southerly will frequently pass a Point or two\r\nto the Eastwards of the South, and the Northerly as much to the\r\nWestwards of the North, which seems occasion'd by the great quantity of\r\nLand, which is interspers'd in these Seas.\r\n\r\n6. That in the same _Meridians_, but to the Southwards of the Æquator,\r\nbeing that Tract lying between _Sumatra_ and _Java_ to the West, and\r\n_New Guinea_ to the East, the same Northerly _Monsoons_ are observ'd,\r\nbut with this difference, that the inclination of the Northerly is\r\ntowards the N. West, and of the Southerly towards the S. E. but the\r\n_plagæ venti_ are not more constant here than in the former, _viz._\r\nvariable five or six Points; besides the times of the Change of these\r\nWinds, are not the same as in the _Chinese_ Seas, but about a Month or\r\nsix Weeks later.\r\n\r\n7. That these contrary Winds do not shift all at once, but in some\r\nplaces the time of the Change is attended with Calms, in others with\r\nvariable Winds; and it is particularly remarkable, that the end of the\r\nWesterly _Monsoon_ on the Coast of _Coromandel_, and the two last Months\r\nof the Southerly _Monsoon_ in the Seas of _China_, are very subject to\r\nbe tempestuous: The violence of these Storms is such, that they seem to\r\nbe of the Nature of the _West-India Hurricanes_, and render the\r\nNavigation of these parts very unsafe about that time of the Year. These\r\nTempests are by our Seamen usually term'd, _The breaking up of the\r\nMonsoons_.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the shifting of these Winds, all those that sail in these\r\nSeas, are oblig'd to observe the Seasons proper for their Voyages, and\r\nso doing they fail not of a fair Wind and speedy Passage; but if so be\r\nthey chance to out-stay their time, till the contrary _Monsoon_ sets in,\r\nas it frequently happens, they are forc'd to give over the hopes of\r\naccomplishing their intended Voyages, and either return to the Port from\r\nwhence they came, or else put in to some other Harbour, there to spend\r\nthe time till the Winds shall come favourable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The third Ocean call'd _Mare Pacificum_, whose Extent is equal to\r\nthat of the other two (it being from the West Coast of _America_ to the\r\n_Philippine_ Islands, not less than 150 Degrees of Longitude) is that\r\nwhich is least known to our own or the Neighbour Nations; that\r\nNavigation that there is on it, is by the _Spaniards_, who go Yearly\r\nfrom the Coast of _New Spain_ to the _Manilha's_, but that but by one\r\nbeaten track; so that I cannot be so particular here as in the other\r\ntwo. What the _Spanish_ Authors say of the Winds they find in their\r\nCourses, and what is confirm'd by the old Accounts of _Drake_ and\r\n_Cavendish_; and since by _Schooten_, who sail'd the whole breadth of\r\nthis Sea in the Southern Latitude of fifteen or sixteen Degrees, is,\r\nthat there is a great conformity between the Winds of this Sea, and\r\nthose of the _Atlantick_ and _Æthiopick_; that is to say, that to the\r\nNorthwards of the Æquator, the predominant Wind is between the East and\r\nNorth-East; and to the Southwards thereof there is a constant steady\r\nGale between the East and South-East, and that on both sides the Line\r\nwith so much constancy, that they scarce ever need to attend the Sails,\r\nand Strength, that it is rare to fail of crossing this vast Ocean in ten\r\nWeeks time, which is about 130 Miles _per diem_; besides, 'tis said that\r\nStorms and Tempests are never known in these parts: So that here is the\r\nvery best of Sailing; no want of a fresh fair Wind, and yet no danger of\r\nhaving too much: Wherefore some have thought it might be as short a\r\nVoyage to _Japan_ and _China_, to go by the Streights of _Magellan_, as\r\nby the _Cape_ of _Good Hope_.\r\n\r\nThe Limits of these general Winds are also much the same as in the\r\n_Atlantick_ Sea, _viz._ about the thirtieth Degree of Latitude on both\r\nsides; for the _Spaniards_ homewards bound from the _Manilha's_, always\r\ntake the advantage of the Southerly _Monsoon_, blowing there in the\r\nSummer Months, and run up to the Northwards of that Latitude, as high as\r\n_Japan_, before they meet with variable Winds, to shape their Course to\r\nthe Eastwards. And _Schooten_ and others that have gone about by the\r\n_Magellan_ Streights, have found the Limits of S. E. Winds, much about\r\nthe same Latitude to the Southwards; besides a farther _Analogy_ between\r\nthe Winds of this Ocean, and the _Æthiopick_, appears in that, upon the\r\nCoast of _Peru_, they are always much Southerly, like as they are found\r\nnear the Shoars of _Angola_.\r\n\r\nThus far Matter of Fact, wherein if the information I have receiv'd be\r\nnot in all parts Accurate, it has not been for want of inquiry from\r\nthose I conceiv'd best able to instruct me; and I shall take it for a\r\nvery great Kindness if any Master of a Ship, or other Person, well\r\ninform'd of the Nature of the Winds, in any of the aforemention'd parts\r\nof the World, shall please to communicate their Observations thereupon;\r\nso that what I have here Collected may be either confirm'd or amended,\r\nor by the addition of some material Circumstances enlarg'd. It is not\r\nthe work of one, nor of few, but of a multitude of Observers, to bring\r\ntogether the Experience requisite to compose a perfect and compleat\r\nHistory of these Winds; however I am not much doubtful that I have err'd\r\nin, or omitted any of the principal Observables, whatever lesser\r\nParticulars may have escaped my Knowledge.\r\n\r\nTo help the Conception of the Reader in a manner of so much difficulty,\r\nI believ'd it necessary to adjoin a Scheme, (_Plate 2._) shewing at one\r\nview all the various Tracts and Courses of these Winds; whereby 'tis\r\npossible the thing may be better understood, than by any verbal\r\nDescription whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe Limits of these several Tracts are design'd every where by prickt\r\nLines, as well in the _Atlantick_ and _Æthiopick_, where they are the\r\nboundaries of the Trade and variable Winds, as in the _Indian_ Ocean,\r\nwhere they also shew the Extent of the several _Monsoons_. I could think\r\nof no better way to design the Course of the Winds on the Map, than by\r\ndrawing rows of stroaks in the same Line that a Ship would move going\r\nalways before it; the sharp end of each little stroak pointing out that\r\npart of the Horizon, from whence the Wind continually comes; and where\r\nthere are _Monsoons_, the rows of the stroaks run alternately backwards\r\nand forwards, by which means they are thicker there than elsewhere. As\r\nto the great South Sea, considering its vast Extent, and the little\r\nVariety there is in its Winds, and the great _Analogy_ between them, and\r\nthose of the _Atlantick_ and _Æthiopick_ Oceans; besides, that the\r\ngreatest part thereof is wholly unknown to us; I thought it unnecessary\r\nto lengthen the Map therewith.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing History are contained several Problems, that merit well\r\nthe Consideration of our acutest Naturalists, both by reason of the\r\nconstancy of the Effect, and of the immense Extent thereof; near half\r\nthe Surface of the Globe being concerned. The chief of these Problems\r\nare, 1. Why these Winds are perpetually from the East in the _Atlantic_\r\nand _Æthiopick_; as likewise in the _Pacifick_ Ocean, between the\r\nLatitudes of 30 North and South? 2. Why the said Winds extend no farther\r\nwith constancy than to the Latitude of 30 Degrees? 3. Why there should\r\nbe a constant South-Westerly Wind upon and near the Coast of _Guinea_?\r\n4. Why in the North part of the _Indian_ Ocean, the Winds, which for one\r\nhalf Year do agree with those of the other two Oceans, should change in\r\nother half Year, and blow from the opposite Points; whilst the Southern\r\npart of that Ocean follows the General Rule, and has perpetual Winds\r\nabout S. E? 5. Why in these General Trade-Winds it should be always\r\ntrue, that to the Northward of the _Æquator_ it is inclin'd to the\r\nNorthwards of the East; and in South Latitudes, to the Southward\r\nthereof? 6. Why in these Seas of _China_ there should be so great an\r\nInclination from the East to the North, more than elsewhere? with many\r\nmore, which it would be much easier to propose than answer.\r\n\r\nBut lest I should seem to propose to others, Difficulties which I have\r\nnot thought worth my own Time and Pains, take here the result of an\r\nearnest Endeavour after the true reason of the aforesaid _Phænomena_;\r\nwherein if I am not able to account for all Particulars, yet 'tis hoped\r\nthe Thoughts I have spent thereon, will not be judged wholly lost, by\r\nthe Curious in Natural Enquiries.\r\n\r\nWind is most properly defined to be the Stream or Current of the Air,\r\nand where such a Current is perpetual and fixt in its Course, 'tis\r\nnecessary that it proceed from a permanent un-intermitting Cause.\r\nWherefore some have been inclin'd to propose the diurnal _Rotation_ of\r\nthe Earth upon its _Axis_, by which, as the _Globe_ turns Eastwards, the\r\nloose and _fluid_ Particles of the Air, being so exceeding light as they\r\nbe, are left behind, so that in respect of the Earths _Surface_ they\r\nmove Westwards, and become a constant Easterly Wind. This Opinion seems\r\nconfirm'd, for that these Winds are found only near the _Æquinoctial_,\r\nin those Parallels of Latitude where the diurnal Motion is swiftest; and\r\nI should readily assent to it, if the constant Calms in the _Atlantick_\r\nSea, near the _Æquator_, the Westerly Winds near the Coast of _Guinea_;\r\nand the _Periodical_ Westerly _Monsoons_ under the _Æquator_ in the\r\n_Indian_ Seas, did not declare the insufficency of that _Hypothesis_.\r\nBesides the Air being kept to the Earth by the Principle of _Gravity_,\r\nwould acquire the same degree of _Velocity_ that the Earths _Surface_\r\nmoves with, as well in respect of the diurnal _Rotation_, as of the\r\nAnnual about the Sun, which is about thirty times swifter.\r\n\r\nIt remains therefore to substitute some other Cause, capable of\r\nproducing a like constant Effect, not liable to the same Objections, but\r\nagreeable to the known Properties of the Elements of Air and Water, and\r\nthe Laws of the Motion of fluid Bodies. Such an one is, I conceive, the\r\nAction of the Sun Beams upon the Air and Water, as he passes every Day\r\nover the Oceans, consider'd together with the Nature of the Soil, and\r\nSituation of the adjoining Continents: I say therefore, first, that\r\naccording to the Laws of _Staticks_, the Air which is less rarified or\r\nexpanded by heat, and consequently more ponderous, must have a Motion\r\ntowards those parts thereof, which are more rarified, and less\r\nponderous, to bring it to an _Æquilibrium_; and secondly, That the\r\nPresence of the Sun continually shifting to the Westwards, that part\r\ntowards which the Air tends, by reason of the Rarifaction made by his\r\ngreatest _Meridian_ Heat, is with him carried Westward, and consequently\r\nthe tendency of the whole Body of the lower Air is that way.\r\n\r\nThus a general Easterly Wind is formed, which being impressed upon all\r\nthe Air of a vast Ocean, the Parts impel one the other, and so keep\r\nmoving till the next return of the Sun, whereby so much of the Motion as\r\nwas lost, is again restored, and thus the Westerly Wind is made\r\nperpetual.\r\n\r\nFrom the same Principle it follows, that this Easterly Wind should on\r\nthe North side of the _Æquator_, be to the Northwards of the East, and\r\nin South Latitudes to the Southwards thereof; for near the _Line_, the\r\nAir is much more rarified, than at a greater distance from it; because\r\nof the Sun twice in a Year Vertical, and at no time distant above 23\r\nDegr. and a half; at which distance the Heat, being as the Sine of the\r\nAngle of Incidence, is but little short of that of the perpendicular\r\nRay. Whereas under the Tropicks, though the Sun stay long Vertical, yet\r\nhe is as long 47 Degr. off; which is a kind of Winter, wherein the Air\r\nso cools, as that the Summer-heat cannot warm it to the same degree with\r\nthat under the Æquator. Wherefore the Air to the Northwards and\r\nSouthwards, being less rarified than that in the middle, it follows,\r\nthat from both sides it ought to tend towards the Æquator: This Motion\r\ncompounded with the former Easterly Wind, answers all the _Phænomena_ of\r\nthe general Trade-winds; which, if the whole Surface of the Globe were\r\nSea, would undoubtedly blow all round the World, as they are found to do\r\nin the _Atlantick_, and _Æthiopick_ Oceans.\r\n\r\nBut seeing that so great Continents do interpose, and break the\r\ncontinuity of the Oceans, regard must be had to the Nature of the Soil,\r\nand the Position of the high Mountains, which I suppose the two\r\nprincipal Causes of the several Variations of the Winds, from the former\r\ngeneral Rule: For if a Country lying near the Sun, prove to be flat,\r\nsandy, low Land, such as the Desarts of _Lybia_ are usually reported to\r\nbe, the Heat occasion'd by the Reflection of the Suns Beams, and the\r\nretention thereof in the Sand, is incredible to those that have not felt\r\nit; whereby the Air being exceedingly rarified, it is necessary that the\r\ncooler and more dense Air should run thitherwards to restore the\r\n_Æquilibrium_: This I take to be the cause, why near the Coast of\r\n_Guinea_ the Wind always sets in upon the Land, blowing Westerly instead\r\nof Easterly, there being sufficient Reason to believe, that the Inland\r\nParts of _Africa_ are prodigiously hot, since the Northern Borders\r\nthereof were so intemperate, as to give the Ancients cause to conclude,\r\nthat all beyond the _Tropick_, was made uninhabitable by excess of Heat:\r\nFrom the same Cause it happens, that there are so constant Calms in that\r\npart of the Ocean, called the _Rains_, (described in the 7th Remark on\r\nthe _Atlantick_ Sea) for this Tract being placed in the middle, between\r\nthe Westerly Winds blowing on the Coast of _Guinea_, and the Easterly\r\nTrade-winds, blowing to the Westwards thereof, the tendency of the Air\r\nhere, is indifferent to either, and so stands in _Æquilibrio_ between\r\nboth; and the weight of the incumbent Atmosphere being diminished by the\r\ncontinual contrary Winds blowing from hence, is the reason that the Air\r\nhere holds not the copious Vapour it receives, but lets it fall into\r\nfrequent Rains.\r\n\r\nBut as the cool and dense Air, by reason of its greater Gravity, presses\r\nupon the hot and rarified, 'tis demonstrative that this latter must\r\nascend in a continued Stream as fast it rarifies; and that being\r\nascended, it must disperse it self to preserve the _Æquilibrium_: that\r\nis, by a contrary Current, the upper Air must move from those Parts\r\nwhere the greatest Heat is: So by a kind of Circulation, the North-East\r\nTrade-Wind below, will be attended with a South-Westerly above, and the\r\nSouth-Easterly with a North-West Wind above; that this is more than a\r\nbare Conjecture, the almost instantaneous Change of the Wind to the\r\nopposite Point, which is frequently found in passing the limits of the\r\nTrade-winds, seems to assure us; but that which above all confirms this\r\n_Hypothesis_ is the _Phænomenon_ of the _Monsoons_, by this means most\r\neasily solved, and without it hardly explicable.\r\n\r\nSupposing therefore such a Circulation, as above, 'tis to be considered\r\nthat to the Northward of the _Indian_ Ocean there is every where Land\r\nwithin the usual limit of the Latitude of 30, _viz._ _Arabia_, _Persia_,\r\n_India_, _&c._ which for the same reason as the _Mediterranean_ Parts of\r\n_Africa_, are subject to unsufferable Heats when the Sun is to the\r\nNorth, passing nearly Vertical; but yet are temperate enough when the\r\nSun is removed towards the other _Tropick_; because of a ridge of\r\nMountains at some distance within the Land, said to be frequently in\r\nWinter cover'd with Snow, over which the Air, as it passes, must needs\r\nbe much chill'd. Hence it comes to pass, that the Air coming according\r\nto the general Rule, out of the N. E. in the _Indian_ Seas, is sometimes\r\nhotter, sometimes colder, than that which by this Circulation is\r\nreturn'd out of the S. W. and by consequence, sometimes the under\r\nCurrent or Wind, is from the N. E. sometimes from the S. W.\r\n\r\nThat this has no other Cause, is clear from the times wherein these\r\nWinds set in, _viz._ in _April_, when the Sun begins to warm those\r\nCountries to the North, the S. W. _Monsoon_ begins, and blows during the\r\nHeats till _October_; when the Sun being retir'd, and all things growing\r\ncooler Northward, and the Heat increasing to the South, the North-East\r\nWinds enter and blow all the Winter till _April_ again. And it is\r\nundoubtedly from the same Principle that to the Southwards of the\r\nÆquator, in part of the _Indian_ Ocean, the North-West Winds succeed to\r\nthe South-East, when the Sun draws near the _Tropick_ of _Capricorn_;\r\nbut I must confess, that in this latter occurs a difficulty, not well to\r\nbe accounted for, which is, why this Change of the _Monsoons_ should be\r\nany more in this Ocean, than in the same Latitudes in the _Æthopick_,\r\nwhere there is nothing more certain than a S. E. Wind all the Year.\r\n\r\n'Tis likewise very hard to conceive why the limits of the Trade-wind\r\nshould be fixt, about the thirtieth Degree of Latitude all round the\r\nGlobe; and that they should so seldom transgress or fall short of those\r\nbounds; as also that in the _Indian_ Sea, only the Northern Part should\r\nbe subject to the changeable _Monsoons_, and in the Southern there be a\r\nconstant S. E.\r\n\r\nThese are Particulars that merit to be consider'd more at large, and\r\nfurnish a sufficient Subject for a just Volume, which will be a very\r\ncommendable Task for such, who being us'd to Philosophick Contemplation,\r\nshall have leisure to apply their serious Thoughts about it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate 2 pag. 80_\r\n\r\n A new & Correct SEA CHART\r\n of the\r\n WHOLE WORLD\r\n _Shewing the _Variations_ of yᵉ\r\n _COMPASS_\r\n as they were found Año 1700\r\n with a View of the Generall\r\n and Coasting _Trade Winds_\r\n and _Monsoons_ or shifting\r\n _Trade Winds_\r\n by the Direction of\r\n _Capᵗ.

By _Edm.\r\n   Halley_._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Elastick Property of the Air has been long since made out, by\r\nExperiments before the _Royal Society_, and elsewhere; and the\r\nResistance of its Spring is found to be nearly equal to the Weight or\r\nForce that compresses it; as also, that the Spaces the same Air\r\noccupies, under differing Pressures, are reciprocally as those\r\nPressures: It has been shewn likewise by undoubted Experiment, that the\r\nspecifick Gravity of the Air, near the Earth's Surface to that of Water,\r\nwas once as 1 to 840; again as 1 to 852; and a third time, in a very\r\nlarge Vessel holding 10 Gallons, as 1 to 860; all which, considering the\r\nDifficulty of the Experiment, agree well enough, the Mercury standing at\r\nall those times about 29 Inches ¾: But by Reason 'twas Summer-weather,\r\nand consequently the Air rarified, when all these were tried, we may\r\nwithout sensible Error say in round numbers, that the Barometer standing\r\nat 30 Inches, and in a mean State of Heat and Cold, the specifick\r\nGravity of the Air to Water, is as 1 to 800. By the like Trials the\r\nweight of Mercury to Water, is as 13½ to 1, or very near it; so that\r\nthe weight of Mercury to Air, is as 10800 to 1; and a Cylinder of Air of\r\n10800 Inches or 900 Feet, is equal to an Inch of Mercury; and were the\r\nAir of an equal density like Water, the whole Atmosphere would be no\r\nmore than 5,1 Miles high, and in the Ascent of every 900 Feet the\r\nBarometer would sink an Inch. But the Expansion of the Air increasing in\r\nthe same proportion as the incumbent weight of the Atmosphere decreases;\r\nthat is, as the Mercury in the Barometer sinks; the upper Parts of the\r\nAir are much more rarified than the lower, and each Space answering to\r\nan Inch of Quicksilver, grows greater and greater; so that the\r\nAtmosphere must be extended to a much greater height. Now, upon these\r\nPrinciples, to determine the height of the Mercury at any assigned\r\nheight in the Air; and _è contra_, having the height of the _Mercury_\r\ngiven, to find the height of the Place where the Barometer stands, are\r\nProblems not more difficult than curious; and which I thus resolve.\r\n\r\nThe Expansions of the Air being reciprocally as the heights of the\r\nMercury, it is evident, that by the help of the Curve of the _Hyperbola_\r\nand its _Asymptotes_, the said Expansions may be expounded to any given\r\nheight of the _Mercury_: For by the 65th _Prop. lib. 2. Conic.\r\nMydorgii_, _the Rectangles_, _ABCE_, _AKGE_, _ALDE_, _&c._ (in _Plate 1.\r\nFig. 4._) are always equal, and consequently the sides, _CB_, _GK_,\r\n_LD_, &c. are reciprocally as the sides _AB_, _AK_, _AL_, &c. If then\r\nthe Lines _AB_, _AK_, _AL_, be supposed equal to the heights of the\r\n_Mercury_, or the pressures of the Atmosphere, the Lines _CB_, _GK_,\r\n_LD_, answering thereto, will be as the Expansions of the Air under\r\nthose Pressures, or the Bulks that the same quantity of Air will occupy;\r\nwhich Expansions being taken infinitely many, and infinitely little,\r\n(according to the Method of Indivisibles) their Summ will give the\r\nSpaces of Air between the several heights of the _Barometer_; that is to\r\nsay, the Summ of all the Lines between _CB_ and _KG_, or the _Area_\r\n_CBKG_, will be proportioned to the Distance or Space intercepted\r\nbetween the Levels of two Places in the Air, where the _Mercury_ would\r\nstand at the heights represented by the Lines _AB_, _AK_; so then the\r\nSpaces of Air answering to equal Parts of _Mercury_ in the _Barometer_,\r\nare as the _Area's_ _CBKG_, _GKLD_, _DLFM_, &c. These _Area's_ again\r\nare, by the Demonstration of _Gregory_ of St. _Vincent_, proportionate\r\nto the _Logarithms_ of the Numbers expressing the _Rationes_ of _AK_ to\r\n_AB_, of _AL_ to _AK_, of _AM_ to _AL_, &c. So then by the common Table\r\nof _Logarithms_, the height of any Place in the _Atmosphere_, having any\r\nassign'd height of the _Mercury_, may most easily be found: For the Line\r\n_CB_ in the _Hyperbola_, whereof the _Area's_ design the _Tabular\r\nLogarithms_, being 0,0144765; 'twill be, as 0,0144765, to the difference\r\nof the _Logarithms_ of 30, or any other lesser Number, for 900 Feet, or\r\nthe Space answering to an Inch of _Mercury_, if the Air were equally\r\nprest with 30 Inches of _Mercury_, and every where alike, to the height\r\nof the _Barometer_ in the Air, where it will stand at that lesser number\r\nof Inches: And by the Converse of this Proportion may the height of the\r\n_Mercury_ be found, having the Altitude of the Place given. From these\r\nRules I deriv'd the following Tables.\r\n\r\n _A Table shewing the Altitude,\r\n to given heights of the _Mercury_._\r\n\r\n Inch.

Plate 1._ that the proportion of\r\nthe height of the whole Air, to the Semi-diameter of the Earth, is much\r\nabout, as 1 to 90, or as the excess of the _Secant_ of about 8½\r\nDegrees to the _Radius_. For if _E_ be the Eye of the Observer, _S_ a\r\nPlace where the Sun sets at the end of Twilight in _E_, and the Arch\r\n_ECS_, or _TCA_, be found 18 Degrees, the excess of the _Secant_ of half\r\nthereof _ECH_, would be the height of the Air, _viz._ _GH_: But the Beam\r\nof the Sun _ASH_, and the Visual Ray _EH_, do each of them suffer a\r\nRefraction of about 32 or 33 Minutes, whereby being bent inwards from\r\n_H_ towards _G_, the height of the Air need not be so great as if they\r\nwent streight; and having from the Angle _ECS_ taken the double\r\nRefraction of the _Horizontal Ray_, the half of the Remainder will be\r\n8½ Degrees _circiter_, whose _Secant_ being 10,111, it follows, that\r\nas 10000 to 111, so the Semi-diameter of the Earth supposed 4000 Miles,\r\nto 44,4 Miles; which will be the height of the whole Air, if the Places\r\n_E_, _S_, whose visible Portions of the _Atmosphere_ _ERZH_, and _SHKB_,\r\njust touch one the other, be 18 Degrees asunder.\r\n\r\nAt this height the Air is expanded into above 3000 times the space it\r\noccupies here, and we have seen the Experience of condensing it into the\r\n60th part of the same Space, so that it should seem, that the Air is a\r\nSubstance capable of being compressed into the 180000th part of the\r\nSpace it would naturally take up, when free from pressure. Now what\r\nTexture or Composition of Parts shall be capable of this great Expansion\r\nand Contraction, seems a very hard Question; and which, I suppose, is\r\nscarce sufficiently accounted for, by comparing it to Wool, Cotten, and\r\nthe like springy Bodies.\r\n\r\nHitherto I have only consider'd the _Air_ and _Atmosphere_, as one\r\nunalter'd Body, as having constantly at the Earth's Surface the 800th\r\npart of the weight of Water, and being capable of Rarifaction and\r\nCondensation _in infinitum_; neither of which _Hypotheses_ are rigidly\r\ntrue: For here in _England_ it is notoriously known, that the weight of\r\nthe whole _Atmosphere_ is various, being counterpoised sometimes by\r\n28½ Inches of _Mercury_, and at other times by no less than 30½;\r\nso that the under parts being pressed by about a 15th part, less weight,\r\nthe _specifick_ Gravity of the Air upon that score will sometimes be a\r\n15th part lighter than another; besides Heat and Cold, does very\r\nconsiderably dilate and contract the Air, and consequently alter its\r\nGravity; to which add the mixture of _Effluvia_, or steams arising from\r\nalmost all Bodies, which assimulating into the Form of Air, are kept\r\nsuspended therein, as Salts dissolv'd in Liquors, or Metals in corroding\r\n_Menstrua_; which Bodies being all of them very much heavier than Air,\r\ntheir Particles by their Admixture must needs encrease the weight of\r\nthat Air they lie incorporated withal, after the same manner as melted\r\nSalts do augment the specifick Gravity of Water. The other Consideration\r\nis, that the Rarifaction and Condensation of the Air is not precisely\r\naccording to the proportion here laid down; for the Experiment very\r\nnearly agrees thereto, as may be seen in the 58th Chapter of Mr.\r\n_Hook's_ _Micrography_; yet are the Condensations not possible beyond\r\ncertain degrees: For being compressed into an 800th part of the Space it\r\ntakes up here, its consistence would be equally dense with that of\r\nWater; which yields not to any force whatsoever, as hath been found by\r\nseveral Experiments tried here, and at _Florence_, by the _Academia del\r\nCimento_. Nor can the Rarifaction proceed _in infinitum_; for supposing\r\nthe Spring whereby it dilates it self, occasion'd by what Texture of\r\nParts you please, yet must there be a determinate Magnitude of the\r\nnatural State of each Particle, as we see it is in Wool, and the like,\r\nwhose Bodies being compressable into a very small Space, have yet a\r\ndeterminate bulk which they cannot exceed, when free'd from all manner\r\nof Pressure.\r\n\r\nThese Objections being true, do disturb the Geometrical Accuracy of\r\nthese Conclusions, drawn from the specifick Gravity of the Air observ'd\r\nat any time; but the Method here shewn will compute by a like\r\nCalculation, the heights of the Quick-silver, and the Rarifactions of\r\nthe Air from any assign'd height of the _Barometer_ at the Earth's\r\nSurface, and any specifick Gravity given. As to the Condensation and\r\nRarifaction by Heat and Cold, and the various mixture of Aqueous and\r\nother Vapours, these two Objections seem generally to compensate each\r\nother; for when the Air is rarified by Heat, they are raised most\r\ncopiously; so that though the Air properly so call'd, be expanded, and\r\nconsequently lighter, yet the _Interstices_ thereof being crouded full\r\nof Vapours of much heavier Matters, bulk for bulk, the weight of the\r\n_Compositum_ may continue much the same, at least a most curious\r\nExperiment made by the Ingenious Mr. _John Caswell_, of _Oxford_, upon\r\nthe top of _Snowdon_ Hill, in _Carnarvanshire_, seems to prove, that the\r\nfirst Inches of _Mercury_ have their Portions of Air near enough to what\r\nI now determine: For the height of the Hill being 1240 Yards, or very\r\nnear it, he found the _Mercury_ to have subsided to 25,6 Inches, or 4\r\ninches below the mean Altitude thereof at the Level of the Sea, (which\r\nis a greater difference than has been found in any of our former\r\nExperiments,) and the Space answering to 4 Inches, by my Calculation,\r\nshould be 1288 Yards; and it agrees as well with the Observations in the\r\nAppendix to Mr. _Pascall_'s Book, _del Equilibre des Liqueurs_, made on\r\nthe high Hill in _Auvergne_, call'd _le puy de Domme_. So that the\r\nRarifaction and Vapours seem not to have alter'd considerably, the\r\nGravity of the under Parts of the _Air_; and much above the height where\r\nthese Experiments were made, do few Vapours ascend, and the Cold is such\r\nthat the Snow lies continually, so that for the more elevated Parts of\r\nthe Sphere of _Air_, there is much less Reason to doubt.\r\n\r\nBut now we have had occasion to mention the difference there is between\r\nthe height of the _Mercury_ at one time, from the height thereof at\r\nanother, it may not be unacceptable to offer at some Reasons for the\r\nsaid difference; which, at least to my self, seem to have some\r\nappearance of Truth. _First_, Then it's undoubtedly demonstrable, that\r\nthe height of the Cylinder of _Mercury_ is equal to the weight of the\r\nwhole incumbent Air, and consequently that that whole is sometimes a\r\nfifteenth more than at other times; which cannot otherwise be, but by\r\nthe access of new Matter when 'tis heavy, and its diminution when 'tis\r\nlight; that _Hypothesis_ therefore that shews how the Air shall be\r\nencreased or diminished, in any particular place, will give a Reason for\r\nthe greater and lesser height of the _Mercury_ in the _Baroscope_: But\r\nto direct us in the choice of the several Causes, which may be assign'd\r\nfor the Increase and Decrease of the Air, 'twill not be unnecessary to\r\nenumerate some of the principal Observations made upon the _Barometer_,\r\nmost whereof are sufficiently known already to all those that are\r\ncurious in these Matters.\r\n\r\nThe _First_ is, That in calm Weather, when the Air is inclin'd to Rain,\r\nthe _Mercury_ is commonly low.\r\n\r\n2. That in serene good settled Weather, the _Mercury_ is generally high.\r\n\r\n3. That upon very great Winds, though they be not accompanied with Rain,\r\nthe _Mercury_ sinks lowest of all, with relation to the Point of the\r\nCompass the Wind blows upon.\r\n\r\n4. That _cæteris paribus_ the greatest heights of the _Mercury_ are\r\nfound upon Easterly and North-Easterly Winds.\r\n\r\n5. That in calm frosty Weather the _Mercury_ generally stands high.\r\n\r\n6. That after very great Storms of Wind, when the _Quicksilver_ has been\r\nlow, it generally rises again very fast.\r\n\r\n7. That the more Northerly places have greater Alterations of the\r\n_Baroscope_, than the more Southerly.\r\n\r\n8. That within the _Tropicks_ and near them, those Accounts I have had\r\nfrom others, and my own Observation at St. _Helena_, make very little or\r\nno Variation of the height of the _Mercury_ in all Weathers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that Theory that can well account for all these appearances, will,\r\nin all probability, approach nearer the true cause of the _Barometers_\r\nVariations, than any thing hitherto afforded; and such an one I am bound\r\nto believe, is that which I here lay down with submission to better\r\nJudgments.\r\n\r\nI conceive that the principal Cause of the rise and fall of the\r\n_Mercury_, is from the variable Winds, which are found in the _Temperate\r\nZones_, and whose great unconstancy here in _England_ is most notorious.\r\nI shall not at present inquire into the Cause of its uncertainty, but\r\nthe Matter of Fact being most undoubted, the Legitimate Consequences\r\nthereof must be allow'd me, let it proceed from what it will.\r\n\r\nA second Cause is the uncertain Exhalation and Præcipitation of the\r\nVapours lodging in the Air, whereby it comes to be at one time much more\r\ncrowded than at another, and consequently heavier; but this latter in a\r\ngreat measure depends upon the former. Now from these Principles I shall\r\nendeavour to explicate the several _Phænomena_ of the _Barometer_,\r\ntaking them in the same order I laid them down.\r\n\r\n1. _Why in calm Weather the Air being inclin'd to Rain, the _Mercury_ is\r\ncommonly low?_ I Answer, That the _Mercury_'s being low, inclines it to\r\nRain; for the Air being light, the Vapours are no longer supported\r\nthereby, being become specifically heavier than the Medium wherein they\r\nfloated; so that they descend towards the Earth, and in their fall\r\nmeeting with other aqueous Particles, they incorporate together, and\r\nform little drops of Rain; but the _Mercury_'s being at one time lower\r\nthan another, is the effect of two contrary Winds blowing from the place\r\nwhence the _Barometer_ stands; whereby the Air of that place is carried\r\nboth ways from it, and consequently the incumbent Cylinder of Air is\r\ndiminished, and accordingly the _Mercury_ sinks; as for Instance, if in\r\nthe _German Ocean_ it should blow a Gale of Westerly Wind, and at the\r\nsame time an Easterly Wind in the _Irish Sea_; or if in _France_ it\r\nshould blow a Southerly Wind, and in _Scotland_ a Northern; it must be\r\ngranted me, that That part of the _Atmosphere_ impendent over _England_,\r\nwould thereby be exhausted and attenuated, and the _Mercury_ would\r\nsubside, and the Vapours which before floated in those parts of the\r\n_Air_ of equal Gravity with themselves, would sink to the Earth.\r\n\r\n2. _Why in serene good settled weather the _Mercury_ is generally high?_\r\nTo this I Answer, That the greater height of the _Barometer_, is\r\noccasion'd by two contrary Winds blowing towards the place of\r\nObservation, whereby the Air of other places is brought thither and\r\naccumulated; so that the incumbent Cylinder of Air being encreas'd both\r\nin height and weight, the _Mercury_ press'd thereby must needs rise and\r\nstand high, as long as the Winds continue so to blow; and then the Air\r\nbeing specifically heavier, the Vapours are better kept suspended, so\r\nthat they have no inclination to Præcipitate and fall down in Drops,\r\nwhich is the reason of the serene good Weather, which attends the\r\ngreater heights of the _Mercury_.\r\n\r\n3. _Why upon very great Winds or Storms, tho' accompanied with no Rain,\r\nthe _Mercury_ sinks lowest of all, with relation to the Point of the\r\nCompass upon which the Wind blows?_ This is caus'd by the very rapid\r\nMotion of the Air in these Storms; for the Tract or Region of the Earths\r\nSurface, wherein these Winds rage, not extending all round the Globe,\r\nthat stagnant Air which is left behind, as likewise that on the sides,\r\ncannot come in so fast as to supply the Evacuation made by so swift a\r\nCurrent; so that the Air must necessarily be attenuated, when and where\r\nthe said Winds continue to blow, and that more or less, according to\r\ntheir Violence; add to which, that the _Horizontal_ Motion of the Air\r\nbeing so quick as it is, may in all probability take off some part of\r\nthe perpendicular pressure thereof; and the great Agitation of its\r\nParticles, is the Reason why the Vapours are dissipated, and do not\r\ncondense into Drops, so as to form Rain, otherwise the natural\r\nConsequence of the Airs Rarifaction.\r\n\r\n4. _Why _cæteris paribus_ the _Mercury_ stands highest upon an Easterly\r\nor North-Easterly Wind?_ This happens because that in the great\r\n_Atlantick Ocean_, on this side the thirty fifth Degree of North\r\nLatitude, the Westerly and South-Westerly Trade-Winds blow almost\r\nalways; so that whenever here the Wind comes up at East and North-East,\r\n'tis sure to be checked by a contrary Gale, as soon as it reaches the\r\nOcean; wherefore, according to what is made out in our second Remark,\r\nthe Air must needs be heaped over this Island; and consequently the\r\n_Mercury_ must stand high, as often as these Winds blow. This holds true\r\nin this Country, but is not a general Rule for others, where the Winds\r\nare under different Circumstances; and I have sometimes seen the\r\n_Mercury_ here as low as twenty nine Inches, upon an Easterly Wind, but\r\nthen it blows exceeding hard, and so comes to be accounted for by what\r\nwas observ'd upon the third Remark.\r\n\r\n5. _Why in calm Weather the _Mercury_ generally stands high?_ The cause\r\nhereof is, as I conceive, that it seldom freezes but when the Winds come\r\nout of the Northern and North-Eastern Quarters, or at least unless those\r\nWinds blow at no great distance off; for the Northern Parts of\r\n_Germany_, _Denmark_, _Sweden_, _Norway_, and all that Tract from whence\r\nNorth-Eastern Winds come, are subject to almost continual Frost all the\r\nWinter; and thereby the lower Air is very much condens'd, and in that\r\nState is brought hitherwards by these Winds, and being accumulated by\r\nthe opposition of the Westerly Wind blowing in the Ocean, the _Mercury_\r\nmust needs be prest to a more than ordinary height, and as a concurring\r\nCause, the shrinking of the lower parts of the Air into lesser room by\r\ncold, must needs cause a descent of the upper parts of the Atmosphere,\r\nto reduce the Cavity made by this contraction to an _Æquilibrium_.\r\n\r\n6. _Why after very great Storms of Wind, when the _Mercury_ has been\r\nvery low, it generally rises again very fast?_ This I have frequently\r\nobserved, and once found it risen an Inch and a half in less than six\r\nHours, after a long continu'd Storm of South-West Wind. This seems to be\r\noccasion'd by the sudden Accession of new Air to supply the great\r\nEvacuation which such continu'd Storms make thereof, in those places\r\nwhence they happen (as in the third Remark) and by the Recoile of the\r\nAir, after the force ceases that impelled it; and the Reason why the\r\n_Mercury_ rises so fast, is because the Air being very much rarify'd\r\nbeyond its mean density, the Neighbouring Air runs in the more swiftly\r\nto bring it to an _Æquilibration_, as we see Water runs the faster for\r\nhaving a great declivity.\r\n\r\n7. _Why in more Northerly places the Variations of the _Baroscope_ are\r\ngreater than in the Southerly?_ The truth of the Matter of Fact is\r\nprov'd from Observations made at _Clermont_ and _Paris_, compar'd with\r\nothers, made at _Stockholm_, as may be seen in the Appendix to Mr.\r\n_Pascal_'s Book before-cited. The Reason I conjecture to be, that the\r\nmore Northerly Parts have usually greater Storms of Wind than the more\r\nSoutherly, whereby the _Mercury_ should sink lower in that Extream; and\r\nthen the Northerly Winds bringing the condens'd and ponderous Air from\r\nthe Neighbourhood of the Pole, and that again being check'd by a\r\nSoutherly Wind, at no great distance, and so heaped, must of necessity\r\nmake the _Mercury_ in such case stand higher in the other Extream.\r\n\r\n8. And Lastly, _Why near the _Æquinoctial_, as at _Barbadoes_ and St.\r\n_Helena_, there is very little or no Variation of the height of the\r\nBarometer?_ This Remark, above all others, confirms the Hypothesis of\r\nthe variable Winds, being the cause of these Variations of the height of\r\nthe _Mercury_; for in the Places above-named, there is always an easie\r\nGale of Wind blowing nearly upon the same Point, _viz._ E. N. E. at\r\n_Barbadoes_, and E. S. E. at St. _Helena_; so that there being no\r\ncontrary Currents of the Air, to exhaust or accumulate it, the\r\nAtmosphere continues much in the same State. However, upon Hurricanes,\r\nthe most violent of Storms, the _Mercury_ has been observ'd very low,\r\nbut this is but for once in two or three Years, and it soon recovers its\r\nsettled state of about 29½ Inches. I doubt not but the same thing is\r\nin the East Coast of _Africa_, and in _India_, where the Monsoons or\r\nTrade-Winds are for half the Year one way, and half the Year another;\r\nonly it's probable, that there may something worth noting happen, about\r\nthe times of the change or shifting of the Winds, which might be\r\nobtain'd, if any Body had the Curiosity to keep the _Barometer_ at our\r\nFactories in _India_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI doubt not but this Doctrine will find some Opposers, and that one\r\nprincipal Objection will be, that I suppose the Air sometimes to move\r\nfrom those Parts where it is already evacuated below the _Æquilibrium_,\r\nand sometimes again towards those parts, where it is condens'd and\r\ncrouded above the mean State, which may be thought contradictory to the\r\nLaws of Staticks and the Rules of the _Æquilibrium_ of Fluids. But those\r\nthat shall consider how, when once an impetus is given to a Fluid Body,\r\nit is capable of mounting above its Level, and checking others that have\r\na contrary tendency to descent by their own Gravity, will no longer\r\nregard this as a material Obstacle, but will rather conclude, that the\r\ngreat _Analogy_ there is between the rising and falling of the Water\r\nupon the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, and this of the accumulating and\r\nextenuating the Air, is a great Argument for the Truth of this\r\nHypothesis: For as the Sea over against the Coast of _Essex_, rises and\r\nswells by the meeting of the two contrary Tides of Flood, (whereof the\r\none comes from the S. W. along the Channel of _England_, and the other\r\nfrom the North); and on the contrary sinks below its Level upon the\r\nretreat of the Water both ways in the Tide of Ebb; so it is very\r\nprobable that the Air may Ebb and Flow, after the same manner; but by\r\nreason of the diversity of Causes, whereby the Air may be set in moving,\r\nthe times of these Fluxes and Refluxes thereof, are purely Casual, and\r\nnot reducible to any Rule, as are the Motions of the Sea, depending\r\nwholly upon the regular Course of the Moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate 1. pag. 97_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A Letter of Mr. _Isaac Newton_, Professor of the Mathematicks in the\r\n   University of _Cambridge_; containing his New Theory about _Light_\r\n   and _Colours_: Sent by the Author to the Publisher from _Cambridge_,\r\n   Feb. 6. 1671/2; in order to be communicated to the _Royal Society_._\r\n\r\n\r\n_SIR_,\r\n\r\nTo perform my late promise to you, I shall without further Ceremony\r\nacquaint you, That in the beginning of the Year 1666 (at which time I\r\napply'd my self to the grinding of Optick-glasses of other Figures than\r\n_Spherical_,) I procur'd me a Triangular Glass-Prism, to try therewith\r\nthe celebrated _Phænomena_ of _Colours_. And in order thereto, having\r\ndarken'd my Chamber, and made a small hole in my Window-shuts, to let in\r\na convenient quantity of the Sun's Light, I plac'd my Prism at his\r\nentrance, that it might be thereby refracted to the opposite Wall. It\r\nwas at first a very pleasing Divertisement, to view the vivid and\r\nintense Colours produced thereby; but after a while applying my self to\r\nconsider them more circumspectly, I became surpriz'd to see them in an\r\n_oblong_ Form; which, according to the received Laws of Rarefraction, I\r\nexpected should have been _Circular_.\r\n\r\nThey were terminated at the sides with streight Lines, but at the ends,\r\nthe decay of Light was so gradual, that it was difficult to determine\r\njustly, what was their Figure; yet they seem'd _Semicircular_.\r\n\r\nComparing the length of this colour'd _Spectrum_ with its breadth, I\r\nfound it about five times greater; a disproportion so extravagant, that\r\nit excited me to a more than ordinary Curiosity of examining, from\r\nwhence it might proceed. I could scarce think, that the various\r\nthickness of the Glass, or the termination with shadow or darkness,\r\ncould have any Influence on Light to produce such an effect; yet I\r\nthought it not amiss, first to examine those Circumstances, and so try'd\r\nwhat would happen by transmitting Light through parts of the Glass of\r\ndivers thicknesses, or through holes in the Window of divers bignesses,\r\nor by setting the Prism without, so that the Light might pass through\r\nit, and be refracted before it was terminated by the hole: But I found\r\nnone of those Circumstances material. The fashion of the Colours was, in\r\nall these Cases, the same.\r\n\r\nThen I suspected, whether by any unevenness in the Glass, or other\r\ncontingent Irregularity, these Colours might be thus dilated. And to try\r\nthis, I took another Prism like the former, and so plac'd it, that the\r\nLight passing through them both, might be refracted contrary ways, and\r\nso by the latter return'd into that Course, from which the former had\r\ndiverted it. For, by this means, I thought the _regular_ effects of the\r\nfirst Prism would be destroy'd by the second Prism, but the _irregular_\r\nones more augmented by the multiplicity of Refractions. The Event was,\r\nthat the Light, which by the first Prism was diffused into an _oblong_\r\nForm, was, by the second, reduc'd into an _orbicular_ one, with as much\r\nregularity, as when it did not at all pass through them. So that\r\nwhatever was the cause of that length, 'twas not any contingent\r\nIrregularity.\r\n\r\nI then proceeded to examine more critically, what might be effected by\r\nthe difference of the incidence of Rays coming from divers parts of the\r\nSun; and to that end, measur'd the several Lines and Angles belonging to\r\nthe Image. Its distance from the Hole or Prism was twenty two Foot; its\r\nutmost length 13¼ Inches; its breadth 2⅝; the Diameter of the Hole\r\n¼ of an Inch; the Angle, with the Rays, tending towards the middle of\r\nthe Image, made with those Lines, in which they would have proceeded\r\nwithout Refraction, was 44° 56'. And the Vertical Angle of the Prism,\r\n63° 12'. Also the Refractions on both sides the Prism, that is, of the\r\nIncident, and Emergent Rays, were as near, as I could make them, equal,\r\nand consequently about 54° 4'. And the Rays fell perpendicularly upon\r\nthe Wall. Now subducting the Diameter of the Hole from the length and\r\nbreadth of the Image, there remains 13 Inches the length, and 2⅜ the\r\nbreadth, comprehended by those Rays, which passed thro' the Center of\r\nthe said Hole, and consequently the Angle of the Hole, which that\r\nbreadth subtended, was about 31', answerable to the Sun's Diameter; but\r\nthe Angle, which its length subtended, was more than five such\r\nDiameters, namely 2° 49'.\r\n\r\nHaving made these Observations, I first computed from them the\r\nrefractive Power of that Glass, and found it measur'd by the _ratio_ of\r\nthe Sines, twenty to thirty one. And then, by that _ratio_, I computed\r\nthe Refractions of two Rays flowing from opposite parts of the Sun's\r\n_discus_, so as to differ 31' in their obliquity of Incidence, and found\r\nthat the emergent Rays should have comprehended an Angle of about 31',\r\nas they did, before they were incident.\r\n\r\nBut because this Computation was founded on the Hypothesis of the\r\nproportionality of the Sines of Incidence and Refraction, which, tho' by\r\nmy own Experience I could not imagine to be so erroneous as to make that\r\nAngle but 31', which in reality was 2° 49'; yet my Curiosity caus'd me\r\nagain to take my Prism. And having plac'd it at my Window, as before, I\r\nobserv'd, that by turning it a little about its _Axis_ to and fro, so as\r\nto vary its obliquity to the light, more than an Angle of four or five\r\nDegrees, the Colours were not thereby sensibly translated from their\r\nplace on the Wall, and consequently by that Variation of Incidence, the\r\nquantity of Refraction was not sensibly varied. By this Experiment\r\ntherefore, as well as by the former Computation, it was evident, that\r\nthe difference of the Incidence of Rays, flowing from divers parts of\r\nthe Sun could not make them, after decussation, diverge at a sensibly\r\ngreater Angle, than that at which they before converged; which being, at\r\nmost, but about thirty one or thirty two Minutes, there still remain'd\r\nsome other cause to be found out, from whence it could be two Deg. 49\r\nMin.\r\n\r\nThen I began to suspect, whether the Rays, after their Trajection\r\nthrough the Prism, did not move in curve Lines, and according to their\r\nmore or less Curvity, tend to divers parts of the Wall. And it increas'd\r\nmy suspicion, when I remember'd that I had often seen a Tennis-Ball,\r\nstruck with an oblique Racket, describe such a curve Line. For a\r\nCircular as well as a Progressive Motion being communicated to it by\r\nthat stroak, its parts on that side, where the Motions conspire, must\r\npress and beat the contiguous Air more violently than on the other, and\r\nthere excite a Reluctancy and Reaction of the Air proportionably\r\ngreater. And for the same Reason, if the Rays of Light should possibly\r\nbe globular Bodies, and by their oblique Passage out of one Medium into\r\nanother, acquire a circulating Motion, they ought to feel the greater\r\nresistance from the ambient Æther, on that side, where this Motion\r\nconspires, and thence be continually bowed to the other. But\r\nnotwithstanding this plausible ground of suspicion, when I came to\r\nexamine it, I could observe no such Curvity in them. And besides (which\r\nwas enough for my purpose) I observ'd, that the difference 'twixt the\r\nlength of the Image, and Diameter of the Hole, through which the Light\r\nwas transmitted, was proportionable to their distance.\r\n\r\nThe gradual removal of these suspicions, at length led me to the\r\n_Experimentum Crucis_, which was this; I took two Boards, and plac'd one\r\nof them close behind the Prism at the Window, so that the light might\r\npass through a small hole, made in it for the purpose, and fall on the\r\nother Board, which I plac'd at about twelve Feet distance, having first\r\nmade a small hole in it also, for some of that incident Light to pass\r\nthrough. Then I plac'd another Prism behind this second Board, so that\r\nthe Light, trajected through both the Boards, might pass thro' that\r\nalso, and be again refracted before it arrived at the Wall. This done, I\r\ntook the first Prism in my Hand, and turn'd it to and fro slowly about\r\nits _Axis_, so much as to make the several parts of the Image, cast on\r\nthe second Board, successively pass through the hole in it, that I might\r\nobserve to what places on the Wall the second Prism would refract them.\r\nAnd I saw by the Variation of those places, that the Light, tending to\r\nthat end of the Image, towards which the Refraction of the first Prism\r\nwas made, did, in the second Prism, suffer a Refraction considerably\r\ngreater than the Light tending to the other end. And so the true cause\r\nof the length of that Image was detected to be no other, than that\r\n_Light_ consists of _Rays differently refrangible_, which, without any\r\nrespect to a difference in their incidence, were, according to their\r\ndegrees of Refrangibility, transmitted towards divers parts of the Wall.\r\n\r\nWhen I understood this, I left off my aforesaid Glass Works; for I saw,\r\nthat the perfection of Telescopes was hitherto limited, not so much for\r\nwant of Glasses truly figur'd, according to the prescriptions of Optick\r\nAuthors (which all Men have hitherto imagin'd), as because that Light it\r\nself is a _Heterogeneous mixture of differently refrangible Rays_. So\r\nthat, were a Glass so exactly figur'd, so as to collect any one sort of\r\nRays into one Point, it could not collect those also into the same\r\nPoint, which having the same Incidence upon the same Medium, are apt to\r\nsuffer a different Refraction. Nay, I wonder'd, that seeing the\r\ndifference of Refrangibility was so great, as I found it, Telescopes\r\nshould arrive to that perfection they are now at. For, measuring the\r\nRefractions in one of my Prisms, I found, that, supposing the common\r\nSine of Incidence upon one of its plains, was forty four Parts, the Sine\r\nof Refraction of the utmost Rays on the red end of the Colours, made out\r\nof the Glass into the Air, would be sixty eight parts, and the Sine of\r\nRefraction of the utmost Rays on the other end, sixty nine parts; so\r\nthat the difference is about a twenty fourth or twenty fifth part of the\r\nwhole Refraction. And consequently the Object glass of any Telescope\r\ncannot collect all the Rays, which come from one point of an Object, so\r\nas to make them convene at its _Focus_ in less room than in a Circular\r\nspace, whose Diameter is the fiftieth part of the Diameter of its\r\nAperture; which is an irregularity, some hundred of times greater, than\r\na circularly figur'd _Lens_, of so small a section as the Object-glasses\r\nof long Telescopes are, would cause by the unfitness of its Figure, were\r\nLight _uniform_.\r\n\r\nThis made me take _Reflections_ into Consideration, and finding them\r\nregular, so that the Angle of Reflection of all sorts of Rays was equal\r\nto their Angle of Incidence; I understood, that by their mediation,\r\nOptick Instruments might be brought to any degree of Perfection\r\nimaginable, provided a _Reflecting_ Substance could be found, which\r\nwould polish as finely as Glass, and _reflect_ as much Light as Glass\r\n_transmits_; and the art of communicating to it a _Parabolick_ Figure be\r\nalso attain'd. But there seem'd very great Difficulties, and I have\r\nalmost thought them insuperable, when I further consider'd, that every\r\nIrregularity in a reflecting Superficies makes the Rays stray five or\r\nsix times more out of their due course, than the like Irregularities in\r\na refracting one; So that a much greater Curiosity would be here\r\nrequisite, than in Figuring Glasses for Refraction.\r\n\r\nAmidst these Thoughts I was forc'd from _Cambridge_ by the Intervening\r\nPlague, and it was more than two Years before I proceeded further. But\r\nthen having thought on a tender way of polishing, proper for Metal,\r\nwhereby, as I imagin'd, the Figure also would be corrected to the last;\r\nI began to try what might be effected in this kind, and by degrees so\r\nfar perfected an Instrument (in the essential parts of it like that I\r\nsent to _London_,) by which I could discern _Jupiter_'s four\r\nConcomitants, and shew'd them divers times to two others of my\r\nAcquaintance. I could also discern the Moon-like Phase of _Venus_, but\r\nnot very distinctly, nor without some niceness in disposing the\r\nInstrument.\r\n\r\nFrom that time I was interrupted, till this last Autumn, when I made the\r\nother. And as that was sensibly better than the first (especially for\r\nDay-Objects,) so I doubt not but they will be still brought to a much\r\ngreater perfection by their Endeavours, who, as you inform me, are\r\ntaking care about it at _London_.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes thought to make a _Microscope_, which in like manner\r\nshould have, instead of an Object-glass, a reflecting piece of Metal.\r\nAnd this I hope they will also take into Consideration: For those\r\nInstruments seem as capable of improvement as _Telescopes_, and perhaps\r\nmore, because but one reflective piece of Metal is requisite in them, as\r\nyou may perceive in _Plate 3. Fig. 1._ where _AB_ representeth the\r\nObject Metal, _CD_ the Eye-glass, _F_ their common Focus, and _O_ the\r\nother Focus of the Metal, in which the Object is placed.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression, I told you, that Light is not\r\nsimilar, or homogeneal, but consists of _difform_ Rays, some of which\r\nare more refrangible than others: So that of those, which are alike\r\nincident on the same Medium, some shall be more refracted than others,\r\nand that not by any virtue of the Glass, or other external Cause, but\r\nfrom a predisposition, which every particular Ray hath to suffer a\r\nparticular degree of Refraction.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to acquaint you with another more notable deformity\r\nin its Rays, wherein the _Origin of Colours_ is unfolded: Concerning\r\nwhich I shall lay down the _Doctrine_ first, and then, for its\r\nExamination, give you an Instance or two of the _Experiments_, as a\r\nSpecimen of the rest.\r\n\r\nThe Doctrine you will find comprehended and illustrated in the following\r\nPropositions.\r\n\r\n1. As the Rays of Light differ in degrees of Refrangibility, so they\r\nalso differ in their disposition to exhibit this or that particular\r\nColour. Colours are not _Qualifications of Light_, derived from\r\nRefractions, or Reflections of natural Bodies, (as 'tis generally\r\nbelieved) but _Original_ and _connate Properties_, which in divers Rays\r\nare divers. Some Rays are disposed to exhibit a red Colour and no other;\r\nsome a yellow and no other, some a green and no other, and so of the\r\nrest. Nor are there only Rays proper and particular to the more eminent\r\nColours, but even to all their intermediate Gradations.\r\n\r\n2. To the same degree of Refrangibility ever belongs the same Colour,\r\nand to the same Colour ever belongs the same degree of Refrangibility.\r\nThe _least Refrangible_ Rays are all disposed to exhibit a _Red_ Colour,\r\nand contrarily those Rays, which are disposed to exhibit a _Red_ Colour,\r\nare all the least Refrangible: So the _most Refrangible_ Rays are all\r\ndisposed to exhibit a deep _Violet Colour_, and contrarily those which\r\nare apt to exhibit such a _Violet Colour_, are all the most Refrangible.\r\nAnd so to all the intermediate Colours in a continued Series belong\r\nintermediate degrees of Refrangibility. And this Analogy 'twixt Colours,\r\nand Refrangibility, is very precise and strict; the Rays always either\r\nexactly agreeing in both, or proportionally disagreeing in both.\r\n\r\n3. The Species of Colour, and Degree of Refrangibility proper to any\r\nparticular sort of Rays, is not mutable by Refraction, nor by Reflection\r\nfrom Natural Bodies, nor by any other Cause, that I could yet observe.\r\nWhen any one sort of Rays hath been well parted from those of other\r\nkinds, it hath afterwards obstinately retain'd its Colour,\r\nnotwithstanding my utmost Endeavours to change it. I have refracted it\r\nwith Prisms, and reflected it with Bodies, which in Day-light were of\r\nother Colours; I have intercepted it with the colour'd Film of Air\r\ninterceding two compressed Plates of Glass; transmitted it through\r\ncolour'd Mediums, and through Mediums irradiated with other sorts of\r\nRays, and diversly terminated it, and yet could never produce any new\r\nColour out of it. It would by contracting and dilating become more\r\nbrisk, or faint, and by the loss of many Rays in some Cases very obscure\r\nand dark; but I could never see it chang'd _in specie_.\r\n\r\n4. Yet seeming Transmutations of Colours may be made, where there is any\r\nmixture of divers sorts of Rays. For in such mixtures, the component\r\nColours appear not, but by their mutual allaying each other, constitute\r\na midling Colour. And therefore, if by Refraction, or any other of the\r\naforesaid Causes, the difform Rays, latent in such a mixture, be\r\nseparated, there shall emerge Colours different from the colour of the\r\nComposition. Which Colours are not new generated, but only made apparent\r\nby being parted; for if they be again intirely mix'd and blended\r\ntogether, they will again compose that Colour, which they did before\r\nseparation. And for the same reason, Transmutations made by the\r\nconvening of divers Colours are not real; for when the difform Rays are\r\nagain severed, they will exhibit the very same Colours, which they did\r\nbefore they entered the Composition; as you see, _Blue_ and _Yellow_\r\nPowders, when finely mixed, appear to the naked Eye _Green_, and yet the\r\nColours of the component Corpuscles are not thereby really transmuted,\r\nbut only blended. For, when viewed with a good Microscope, they still\r\nappear _Blue_ and _Yellow_ interspersedly.\r\n\r\n5. There are therefore two sorts of Colours. The one Original and\r\nSimple, the other compounded of these. The Original or Primary Colours\r\nare, _Red_, _Yellow_, _Green_, _Blue_, and a _Violet-purple_, together\r\nwith Orange, Indico, and an indefinite variety of intermediate\r\nGradations.\r\n\r\n6. The same Colours in _Specie_ with these primary Ones, may be also\r\nproduced by Composition: For, a mixture of _Yellow_ and _Blue_ makes\r\n_Green_; of _Red_ and _Yellow_, makes _Orange_; of _Orange_ and\r\n_Yellowish Green_, makes _Yellow_. And in general, if any two Colours be\r\nmix'd, which in the Series of those, generated by the Prism, are not too\r\nfar distant one from another, they by their mutual Alloy compound that\r\nColour, which in the said Series appeareth in the mid-way between them.\r\nBut those, which are situated at too great a distance, do not so.\r\n_Orange_ and _Indico_ produce not the intermediate _Green_, nor\r\n_Scarlet_ and _Green_ the intermediate _Yellow_.\r\n\r\n7. But the most surprizing and wonderful Composition was that of\r\n_Whiteness_. There is no one sort of Rays which alone can exhibit this.\r\n'Tis ever compounded, and to its Composition are requisite all the\r\naforesaid primary Colours, mix'd in a due proportion. I have often with\r\nadmiration beheld, that all the Colours of the Prism being made to\r\nconverge, and thereby to be again mixed as they were in the light before\r\nit was incident upon the Prism, reproduced light, intirely and perfectly\r\nwhite, and not at all sensibly differing from a _direct_ light of the\r\nSun, unless when the Glasses, I used, were not sufficiently clear; for\r\nthen they would a little incline it to _their_ Colour.\r\n\r\n8. Hence therefore it comes to pass, that _Whiteness_ is the usual\r\nColour of _Light_; for Light is a confused aggregate of Rays, indued\r\nwith all sorts of Colours, as they are promiscuously darted from the\r\nvarious parts of luminous Bodies. And of such a confused aggregate, as I\r\nsaid, is generated Whiteness, if there be a due proportion of the\r\nIngredients; but if any one predominate, the Light must incline to that\r\nColour; as it happens in the blue Flame of Brimstone, the yellow Flame\r\nof a Candle, and the various Colours of the fixed Stars.\r\n\r\n9. These things consider'd, the _manner_, how Colours are produced by\r\nthe Prism, is evident. For, of the Rays, constituting the incident\r\nLight, since those which differ in Colour proportionally differ in\r\nRefrangibility, _they_ by their unequal Refractions must be severed and\r\ndispersed into an oblong Form, in an orderly succession, from the least\r\nrefracted Scarlet to the most refracted Violet. And for the same reason\r\nit is, that Objects, when look'd upon through a Prism, appear coloured.\r\nFor the difform Rays, by their unequal Refractions, are made to diverge\r\ntowards several parts of the _Retina_, and there express the Images of\r\nthings coloured, as in the former case they did the Sun's Image upon a\r\nWall. And by this inequality of Refractions, they become not only\r\ncoloured, but also very confused and indistinct.\r\n\r\n10. Why the Colours of the _Rainbow_ appear in falling drops of Rain, is\r\nalso from hence evident. For those drops, which refract the Rays,\r\ndisposed to appear Purple, in greatest quantity to the Spectator's Eye,\r\nrefract the Rays of other sorts so much less, as to make them pass\r\nbeside it; and such are the drops on the inside of the _Primary_ Bow,\r\nand on the outside of the _Secondary_ or Exteriour one. So those drops,\r\nwhich refract in greatest plenty the Rays, apt to appear red, toward the\r\nSpectator's Eye, refract those of other sorts so much more, as to make\r\nthem pass beside it; and such are the drops on the Exteriour part of the\r\n_Primary_, and Interiour part of the _Secondary_ Bow.\r\n\r\n11. The odd Phænomena of an infusion of _Lignum Nephriticum_,\r\n_Leaf-gold_, _Fragments of colour'd Glass_, and some other transparently\r\ncoloured Bodies, appearing in one Position of one Colour, and of another\r\nin another, are on these grounds no longer Riddles. For those are\r\nSubstances apt to reflect one sort of Light, and transmit another; as\r\nmay be seen in a dark Room, by illuminating them with similar or\r\nuncompounded Light. For then they appear of that Colour only, with which\r\nthey are illuminated; but yet in one Position more vivid and luminous\r\nthan in another, accordingly as they are disposed more or less to\r\nreflect or transmit the incident Colour.\r\n\r\n12. From hence also is manifest the reason of an unexpected Experiment,\r\nwhich Mr. _Hook_, somewhere in his _Micrography_, relates to have made\r\nwith two wedge-like transparent Vessels fill'd, the one with a red, the\r\nother with a blue Liquor; namely, that though they were severally\r\ntransparent enough, yet both together became opake: For, if one\r\ntransmitted only red, and the other only blue, no Rays could pass\r\nthrough both.\r\n\r\n13. I might add more Instances of this Nature; but I shall conclude with\r\nthis general one, that the Colours of all natural Bodies have no other\r\nOrigin than this, that they are variously qualified to reflect one sort\r\nof Light in greater plenty than another. And this I have experimented in\r\na dark Room, by illuminating those Bodies with uncompounded Light of\r\ndivers Colours. For by that means any body may be made to appear of any\r\nColour. They have there no appropriate Colour, but ever appear of the\r\nColour of the Light cast upon them; but yet with this difference,\r\nthat they are most brisk and vivid in the Light of their own\r\nday-light-colour. _Minium_ appeareth there of any Colour indifferently,\r\nwith which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in red; and so _Bise_\r\nappeareth indifferently of any Colour with which 'tis illustrated, but\r\nyet most luminous in blue. And therefore _Minium_ reflecteth Rays of any\r\nColour, but most copiously those endu'd with red, and consequently when\r\nillustrated with day-light, that is, with all sorts of Rays\r\npromiscuously blended, those qualified with red, shall abound most in\r\nthe reflected Light, and by their prevalence cause it to appear of that\r\nColour. And for the same reason _Bise_, reflecting blue most copiously,\r\nshall appear blue by the excess of those Rays in its reflected Light;\r\nand the like of other Bodies. And that this is the intire and adequate\r\ncause of their Colours, is manifest, because they have no power to\r\nchange or alter the Colours of any sort of Rays incident apart, but put\r\non all Colours indifferently, with which they are enlightned.\r\n\r\nThese things being so, it can be no longer disputed, whether there be\r\nColours in the dark, nor whether they be the Qualities of the Objects we\r\nsee, no nor perhaps, whether Light be a Body. For, since Colours are the\r\n_Qualities_ of Light, having its Rays for their intire and immediate\r\nSubject, how can we think those Rays _Qualities_ also, unless one\r\nQuality may be the Subject of and sustain another; which in effect is to\r\ncall it _Substance_? We should not know Bodies for Substances, were it\r\nnot for their sensible Qualities; and the principal of those being now\r\nfound due to something else, we have as good reason to believe that to\r\nbe a Substance also.\r\n\r\nBesides, whoever thought any Quality to be a _heterogeneous_ Aggregate,\r\nsuch as Light is discovered to be? But to determine more absolutely,\r\nwhat Light is, after what manner refracted, and by what Modes or Actions\r\nit produceth in our Minds the Phantasms of Colours, is not so easie. And\r\nI shall not mingle Conjectures with Certainties.\r\n\r\nReviewing what I have written, I see the Discourse it self will lead to\r\ndivers Experiments sufficient for its Examination; and therefore I shall\r\nnot trouble you farther, than to describe one of those, which I have\r\nalready insinuated.\r\n\r\nIn a darkned Room, make a hole in the shut of a Window, whose Diameter\r\nmay conveniently be about a third part of an Inch, to admit a convenient\r\nquantity of the Sun's Light. And there place a clear and colourless\r\nPrism, to refract the entring Light towards the farther part of the\r\nRoom; which, as I said, will thereby be diffused into an oblong coloured\r\nImage. Then place a _Lens_ of about three Foot Radius (suppose a broad\r\nObject-glass of a three Foot Telescope,) at the distance of about four\r\nor five Foot from thence, through which all those Colours may at once be\r\ntransmitted, and made by its Refraction to convene at a farther distance\r\nof about ten or twelve Feet. If at that distance you intercept this\r\nLight with a Sheet of white Paper, you will see the Colours converted\r\ninto whiteness again by being mingled. But it is requisite, that the\r\n_Prism_ and _Lens_ be placed steady, and that the Paper, on which the\r\nColours are cast, be moved to and fro; for, by such motion, you will not\r\nonly find at what distance the whiteness is most perfect, but also see\r\nhow the Colours gradually convene, and vanish into whiteness; and\r\nafterwards, having crossed one another in that place where they compound\r\nwhiteness, are again dissipated and severed, and in an inverted order\r\nretain the same Colours, which they had before they entred the\r\nComposition. You may also see, that, if any of the Colours at the _Lens_\r\nbe intercepted, the whiteness will be changed into the other Colours.\r\nAnd therefore, that the Composition of whiteness be perfect, care must\r\nbe taken that none of the Colours fall besides the _Lens_.\r\n\r\nIn the annexed Design, _Tab. 3. Fig. 2._ of this Experiment, _ABC_\r\nexpresseth the Prism set end-wise to sight, close by the hole _F_ of the\r\nWindow _EG_. Its vertical Angle _ABC_ may conveniently be about 60\r\nDegrees: _MN_ designeth the _Lens_. Its breadth 2½ or 3 Inches. _SF_\r\none of the streight Lines, in which difform Rays may be conceived to\r\nflow successively from the Sun. _FP_, and _FR_ two of those Rays\r\nunequally refracted, which the _Lens_ makes to converge towards _Q_, and\r\nafter decussation to diverge again. And _HI_ the Paper, at divers\r\ndistances, on which the Colours are projected, which in _Q_ constitute\r\n_Whiteness_, but are _Red_ and _Yellow_ in _R_, _r_, and ρ, and _Blue_\r\nand _Purple_ in _P_, _p_, and π.\r\n\r\nIf you proceed further to try the impossibility of changing any\r\nuncompounded Colour (which I have asserted in the third and thirteenth\r\nPropositions,) 'tis requisite that the Room may be very dark, lest any\r\nscattering light, mixing with the Colour, disturb and allay it, and\r\nrender it compound, contrary to the design of the Experiment. 'Tis also\r\nrequisite, that there be a perfecter separation of the Colours, than,\r\nafter the manner above described, can be made by the Refraction of one\r\nsingle Prism; and how to make such farther separations, will scarce be\r\ndifficult to them, that consider the discovered Laws of Refractions. But\r\nif trial shall be made with Colours not throughly separated, there must\r\nbe allowed changes proportionable to the mixture. Thus if compound\r\nYellow Light fall upon blue _Bise_, the Bise will not appear perfectly\r\nyellow, but rather green, because there are in the yellow mixture many\r\nRays indued with green, and green being less remote from the usual blue\r\nColour of Bise than yellow, is the more copiously reflected by it.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, if any one of the Prismatick Colours, suppose red, be\r\nintercepted, on design to try the asserted impossibility of reproducing\r\nthat Colour out of the others which are pretermitted; 'tis necessary,\r\neither that the Colours be very well parted before the red be\r\nintercepted; or that, together with the red, the neighbouring Colours,\r\ninto which any red is secretly dispersed, (that is, the yellow, and\r\nperhaps green too) be intercepted; or else, that allowance be made for\r\nthe emerging of so much red out of the yellow green, as may possibly\r\nhave been diffused, and scatteringly blended in those Colours. And if\r\nthese things be observed, the new Production of red, or any intercepted\r\nColour, will be found impossible.\r\n\r\nThis, I conceive, is enough for an Introduction to Experiments of this\r\nkind; which if any of the _Royal Society_ shall be so curious as to\r\nprosecute, I should be very glad to be informed with what success: That,\r\nif any thing seem to be defective, or to thwart this Relation, I may\r\nhave an opportunity of giving farther Direction about it, or of\r\nacknowledging my Errors, if I have committed any.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Since the Publication of this Theory, some Misunderstandings happening\r\n   between a _French_ Philosopher at _Paris_ and Mr. _Newton_, he has\r\n   endeavour'd to explain himself a little further in these Things,\r\n   according to the following Method._\r\n\r\n\r\n_DEFINITIONS._\r\n\r\n1. I call that Light Homogeneal, Similar, or Uniform, whose Rays are\r\nequally refrangible.\r\n\r\n2. And that Heterogeneal, whose Rays are unequally refrangible.\r\n\r\n_Note_, There are but three Affections of Light in which I have observ'd\r\nits Rays to differ; _viz._ Refrangibility, Reflexibility, and Colour;\r\nand those Rays which agree in Refrangibility, agree also in the other\r\ntwo, and therefore may well be defined Homogeneal; especially since Men\r\nusually call those things Homogeneal, which are so in all Qualities that\r\ncome under their Knowledge, tho' in other Qualities, that their\r\nKnowledge extends not to, there may possibly be some Heterogeneity.\r\n\r\n3. Those Colours I call Simple or Homogeneal, which are exhibited by\r\nHomogeneal Light.\r\n\r\n4. And those Compound or Heterogeneal, which are exhibited by\r\nHeterogeneal Light.\r\n\r\n5. Different Colours, I call, not only the more eminent Species, Red,\r\nYellow, Green, Blue, Purple, but all other the minutest Gradations; much\r\nafter the same manner, that not only the more eminent Degrees in Musick,\r\nbut all the lead Gradations, are esteem'd different Sounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROPOSITIONS._\r\n\r\n1. The Sun's Light consists of Rays differing by indefinite Degrees of\r\nRefrangibility.\r\n\r\n2. Rays which differ in Refrangibility, when parted from one another, do\r\nproportionally differ in the Colours which they exhibit. These Two\r\nPropositions are Matter of Fact.\r\n\r\n3. There are as many Simple or Homogeneal Colours, as Degrees of\r\nRefrangibility. For to every Degree of Refrangibility belongs a\r\ndifferent Colour, by _Prop._ 2. and that Colour is Simple, by _Def._ 1,\r\nand 3.\r\n\r\n4. Whiteness, in all respects like that of the Sun's immediate Light,\r\nand of all the usual Objects of our Senses, cannot be compounded of two\r\nSimple Colours alone. For such a Composition must be made by Rays that\r\nhave only two Degrees of Refrangibility, by _Def._ 1 and 3. and\r\ntherefore it cannot be like that of the Sun's Light. by _Prop._ 1. nor,\r\nfor the same Reason, like that of ordinary white Objects.\r\n\r\n5. Whiteness, in all respects, like that of the Sun's immediate Light,\r\ncannot be compounded of Simple Colours without an indefinite Variety of\r\nthem. For to such a Composition, there are requisite Rays endu'd with\r\nall the indefinite Degrees of Refrangibility, by _Prop._ 1. And those\r\ninfer as many Simple Colours, by _Def._ 1 and 3. and _Prop._ 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nTo make these a little plainer, I have added also the Propositions that\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n6. The Rays of Light do not act on one another, in passing through the\r\nsame Medium.\r\n\r\n7. The Rays of Light suffer not any change of their Qualities from\r\nRefraction.\r\n\r\n8. Nor afterwards from the adjacent quiet _Medium_: These two\r\nPropositions are manifest _de Facto_ in Homogeneal Light, whose Colour\r\nand Refrangibility is not at all changeable, either by Refraction, or by\r\nthe Contermination of a quiet _Medium_. And as for Heterogeneal Light,\r\nit is but an Aggregate of several sorts of Homogeneal Light, no one sort\r\nof which suffers any more alteration than if it were alone; because the\r\nRays act not on one another, by _Prop._ 6. and therefore the Aggregate\r\ncan suffer none. These two Propositions also might be further proved\r\napart, by Experiments too long to be here described.\r\n\r\n9. There can no Homogeneal Colours be reduced out of Light by\r\nRefraction, which were not commixt in it before. Because by _Prop._ 7.\r\nand 8. Refraction changeth not the Qualities of the Rays, but only\r\nseparates those which have divers Qualities, by means of their different\r\nRefrangibility.\r\n\r\n10. The Sun's Light is an Aggregate of an indefinite variety of\r\nHomogeneal Colours, by _Prop._ 1, 3, and 9. And hence it is, that I call\r\nHomogeneal Colours also Primitive or Original. And thus much concerning\r\nColours.\r\n\r\n\r\n _For a further Illustration of this Doctrine, Mr. _Newton_, in his Book\r\n   of Opticks lately published, has by undeniable Experiments explained\r\n   most of the Principal Phænomena of Light and Colours: To which we\r\n   refer the Reader._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A Demonstration concerning the Motion of Light, communicated from\r\n   _Paris_._\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilosophers have been labouring for many Years to decide by some\r\nExperiment, whether the Action of Light be conveyed in an instant to\r\ndistant Places, or whether it requireth time. M. _Romer_, of the _Royal\r\nAcademy_ of Sciences, hath devised a way taken from the Observations of\r\nthe first Satellit of _Jupiter_, by which he demonstrates, that for the\r\ndistance of about 3000 Leagues, such as is very near the bigness of the\r\nDiameter of the Earth, Light needs not one Second of Time.\r\n\r\nLet (in _Fig. 3. Plate 3._) _A_ be the _Sun_, _B_ _Jupiter_, _C_ the\r\nfirst Satellit of _Jupiter_, which enters into the shadow of _Jupiter_,\r\nto come out at _D_, and let _EFGHKL_ be the _Earth_, placed at divers\r\ndistances from _Jupiter_.\r\n\r\nNow suppose the _Earth_, being in _L_, towards the second Quadrature of\r\n_Jupiter_, hath seen the first Satellit, at the time of its emersion, or\r\nissuing out of the shadow at _D_, and that about 42½ Hours after\r\n(_viz._ after one Revolution of this _Satellit_) the _Earth_ being in\r\n_K_, do see it return'd in _D_: It is manifest, that if the Light\r\nrequire time to traverse the Interval _LK_, the _Satellit_ will be seen\r\nreturn'd later in _D_, than it would have been if the _Earth_ had\r\nremained in _L_. So that the Revolution of the _Satellit_ being thus\r\nobserv'd by the Emersions, will be retarded by so much time, as the\r\nLight shall have taken in passing from _L_ to _K_; and that on the\r\ncontrary, in the other Quadrature _FG_, where the _Earth_ by approaching\r\ngoes to meet the Light, the Revolutions of the Emersions will appear to\r\nbe shortned, by so much as those of the Emersions had appear'd to be\r\nlengthned. And because 42½ Hours, which this _Satellit_ very near\r\ntakes to make one Revolution, the distance between the _Earth_ and\r\n_Jupiter_, in both the Quadratures, varies at least 210 Diameters of the\r\n_Earth_: It follows, that if for the Account of every Diameter of the\r\n_Earth_ there were required a Second of Time, the Light would take 3½\r\nMinutes for each of the Intervals _GF_, _KL_; which would cause near\r\nhalf a quarter of an Hour between two Revolutions of the first\r\n_Satellit_, one observ'd in _FG_, and the other in _KL_, whereas there\r\nis not observed any sensible difference.\r\n\r\nYet doth it not follow hence, that Light demands no time. For after M.\r\n_Romer_ had examin'd the thing more nearly, he found that what was not\r\nsensible in two Revolutions, became very considerable in many being\r\ntaken together; and that, for Example, forty Revolutions observed on the\r\nside _F_, might be sensibly shorter, than forty others observ'd in any\r\nplace of the _Zodiack_ where _Jupiter_ may be met with; and that in\r\nproportion of Twenty two for the whole Interval of _HE_, which is the\r\ndouble of the Interval that is from hence to the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of this new Equation of the Retardment of Light, is\r\nestablish'd by all the Observations that have been made in the _Royal\r\nAcademy_, and in the _Observatory_, for the space of eight Years; and it\r\nhath been lately confirmed by the Emersion of the first _Satellit_\r\nobserv'd at _Paris_, the _9th_ of _November_ last, at 5 a-clock 35' 45\"\r\nat Night, 10 Minutes later than it was to be expected, by deducting it\r\nfrom those that had been observ'd in the Month of _August_, when the\r\n_Earth_ was much nearer to _Jupiter_; which M. _Romer_ had predicted to\r\nthe said Academy from the beginning of _September_.\r\n\r\nBut to remove all doubt, that this Inequality is caused by the\r\nRetardment of the Light, he demonstrates, that it cannot come from any\r\nExcentricity, or other Cause of those that are commonly alledged to\r\nexplicate the Irregularities of the _Moon_, and the other Planets;\r\nthough he be well aware, that the first _Satellit_ of _Jupiter_ was\r\nExcentrick; and that, besides his Revolutions were advanced or retarded,\r\naccording as _Jupiter_ did approach to or recede from the Sun; as also,\r\nthat the Revolutions of the _Primum Mobile_ were unequal: Yet, saith he,\r\nthese three last Causes of Inequality do not hinder the first from being\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An introductory _Essay_ to the Doctrine of _Sounds_, containing some\r\n   Proposals for the improvement of _Acousticks_; As it was presented to\r\n   the _Dublin Society_, Nov. 12. 1683, by the Right Reverend Father in\r\n   God _Narcissus_ Lord Bishop of _Ferns_ and _Leighlin_._\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing to treat of the Doctrine of _Sounds_, I hold it convenient to\r\npremise something in the general, concerning this Theory; which may\r\nserve at once to ingage your Attention, and excuse my Pains, when I\r\nshall have recommended them, as bestow'd on a Subject not altogether\r\nuseless and unfruitful.\r\n\r\nAnd for this purpose I shall omit to speak any thing of the _Excellency_\r\nof the Matter in Hand; though it might be celebrated by Arguments drawn\r\nfrom several Topicks, and particularly from this, that new Discoveries\r\nand Improvements may be made, both as to the _Generation_, _Propagation_\r\nand _Reception_ of Sounds into the Sense; which, in a peculiar manner\r\nagrees to this, above the Object of any other Sense whatsoever. I shall,\r\nI say, omit these things, and apply my self wholly to the _Usefulness_\r\nof the Theory, that we are now falling upon, which I think cannot better\r\nbe discovered, than by making a comparison 'twixt the Senses of _Seeing_\r\nand _Hearing_, as to their Improvements. I mean, by shewing, that this\r\nlatter of _Hearing_ is capable of all those improvements which the Sense\r\nof _Seeing_ has receiv'd from Art, besides many more advantages that the\r\n_Ear_ may enjoy, by the help of our Doctrine, above the _Eye_; all which\r\nmoreover will be of as great benefit to Mankind, as any thing that\r\n_Opticks_ have yet discover'd, if not of greater; which, with some other\r\npre-eminencies that it has upon another Score, will happily render\r\n_Acousticks_ the nobler Science of the two.\r\n\r\nIn order to the making good what I but now premised of the Comparison of\r\nthese two Faculties of _Seeing_ and _Hearing_, as to their Improvements,\r\nI observe;\r\n\r\nThat _Vision_ is threefold, _Direct_, _Refracted_, and _Reflex'd_;\r\nanswerable whereunto we have _Opticks_, _Dioptricks_, and _Catoptricks_.\r\n\r\nIn like manner _Hearing_ may be divided into _Direct_, _Refracted_ and\r\n_Reflex'd_; whereto answer three parts of our Doctrine of _Acousticks_,\r\nwhich are yet nameless, unless we call them _Acousticks_, _Diacousticks_,\r\nand _Catacousticks_, or (in another Sense, but to as good Purpose)\r\n_Phonicks_, _Diaphonicks_, and _Cataphonicks_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Direct Vision has been improv'd two ways, _ex parte_ Objecti, and _ex\r\nparte_ Organi _vel_ Medii.\r\n\r\n1. _Ex parte Objecti_, Direct Vision has receiv'd advantages by the Arts\r\nof _Producing_, _Conserving_ and _Imitating Light_ and _Colours_, which\r\nare the Objects of Vision.\r\n\r\n1. For the Art of _Producing Light_, we have the Frication of all hard\r\nBodies that beget Fire; especially of the Flint and Steel; and instead\r\nof the Flint, most hard Stones (as well as the Cane) may be us'd to the\r\nsame effect, as upon trial I have found. Add hereto the lately invented\r\n_Phosphorus_, which is a new and admirable way of producing a _Lucid\r\nSubstance_ by Art, out of a Body in itself not _Lucid_; and therefore\r\nmay not unfitly be term'd an _Artificial production_ of _Light_.\r\n\r\nAnd then of the Art of _Conserving Light_, the _Lapis Bononiensis_ is a\r\nnotable Instance; and so happily were the _Sepulchral Lamps_ of the\r\nAncients.\r\n\r\n2. As to _Colours_, 'tis the greatest part of the Art of _Dying_ to be\r\nable to make and fix (that is preserve) them; and the _Painters_ and\r\n_Limners_ will own it to be no small part of their Skill to be able well\r\nto _Mix_ (that is, in effect, to _Generate_) _Colours_.\r\n\r\n3. For _Imitation of Light_ and _Colours_, 'tis well known how far\r\n_Perspective_ with the Art of _Limning_ and _Shadowing_ have gone\r\ntherein, which all tend some way to the Advance or Improvement of\r\n_Direct Vision_.\r\n\r\nAdd to all these, That _a due Application of Light to the Object_\r\nrenders it Visible, if it were not so before; as appears from a dark\r\nRoom illuminated; or else makes it better and more truly discernable by\r\nthe Sense of _Seeing_, if before it might have been discern'd.\r\n\r\nHence the same _Colour_, in a diverse Light, will appear different, and\r\nno _Picture_ can well be discern'd or judg'd of but by its true Light.\r\nBesides, the _Limner_ will assure you, that he can hardly make true\r\nWork, or hit the Air of a Face exactly, unless he draw by a\r\n_North-Light_, by reason of the steadiness of that, and the uncertainty\r\nof all other Lights whatsoever. Which things shew, that the _Art of duly\r\napplying Light to the Object_ does very much help and improve Vision. So\r\nalso does the due placing of the _Object_, as to _Height_ and\r\n_Distance_. But to enumerate all things that help _Direct Vision_, would\r\nbe infinite.\r\n\r\n2. _Ex parte Organi vel Medii_, Direct Vision has been improv'd by\r\nmaking use of a _Tube_, without Glasses, or a Man's clos'd Hand, to look\r\nthro'; which admitting into the _Eye_ only the principal Rays, that come\r\ndirectly from the Object, do very much strengthen and clear the Sight,\r\nby excluding all the Collateral Rays, that crouding into the Eye,\r\ntogether with the direct ones, would confound and disturb it, partly by\r\nmixing and interfering with the direct Rays, and partly (or rather\r\nchiefly) by too much enlightning the fund of the Eye, wherein Vision is\r\ntruly (tho' then imperfectly) made.\r\n\r\nOn this is founded the Art of making _Spectacles_ without Glasses; (as\r\nwell as _Tubes_) which is done by putting into the Glass-holes (instead\r\nof Glasses) two short _Tubes_ of between three and four Inches long (for\r\ntheir length is to be vary'd according to the Age or Eye of the\r\nBeholder, and so also is the Diameter of the extream ends) which _Tubes_\r\nbeing made of _Spanish Leather_ (or Past-board, or some such like\r\nMatter) and black'd on the inside, are so to be placed, as that the\r\nvisual Rays, receiv'd thro' them, may meet in one point (or rather issue\r\nout from one Point) of the Object standing at such a due distance, as\r\nthe Person may clearly and distinctly see it, or according to his length\r\nof Sight (as ABC, in the 4th _Fig. Tab._ 3.)\r\n\r\nAnd these _Spectacles_ may be suppos'd better for preserving the Sight,\r\nthan the ordinary ones with Glasses, because they represent the Object\r\nmore naturally, and withal more clearly and distinctly to the Eye, than\r\nthe other, whose refracted Rays being collected together with the right\r\nones in the Glasses, do somewhat confound good Vision, as before:\r\nEspecially if the visive Power be strong enough to be sufficiently\r\ndetermin'd by the right Rays alone.\r\n\r\nFor I speak now of preserving a good Eye by these Spectacles, which\r\nholds in proportion true also of a bad one. Because those Rays (both\r\nright and refracted) being collected and brought so near the Eye\r\n(whether good or bad) as the Spectacles are usually plac'd, do too much\r\naffect it, both by their own brightness, and also by the brightness of\r\nthe Colours of the Object (when they are bright) which is brought very\r\nnear also; whereby the Eye is dazl'd and confounded, unless there be a\r\nstrong attention and _conatus_ of the Spirits, whereto the bright Rays\r\ndo certainly engage them, which of necessity weakens Vision, especially\r\nif these Glass-spectacles be much us'd.\r\n\r\nWherefore the now describ'd new Tube-spectacles, contributing so much to\r\nthe help and preservation of Sight, may well be counted an improvement\r\nof _Direct Vision_, because they convey the Rays to the Eye without any\r\nkind of Refraction whatsoever. Seeing the same Object also through\r\nvarious holes, plac'd at certain distances, does somewhat alter Vision;\r\nbut of this perhaps more hereafter.\r\n\r\nNow as _Direct Vision_ has thus been improved, so likewise _Direct\r\nHearing_ partly has already receiv'd, and partly may by the Doctrine\r\nwhereof we are treating, (if well cultivated) farther receive as great\r\nand notable Improvements, both _ex parte_ Objecti, and _ex parte_ Organi\r\n_vel_ Medii.\r\n\r\n1. As to the _Object_ of Hearing, which is Sound, improvement has been\r\nand may be made, both as to the _Begetting_, and as to the _Conveying_\r\nand _Propagating_ (which is a kind of _Conserving_) of Sounds.\r\n\r\n1. As to the _Begetting_ of Sounds. The Art of imitating any Sound,\r\nwhether by _Speaking_ (that is pronouncing) any kind of Language, (which\r\nreally is an Art, and the _Art of Speaking_, perhaps one of the\r\ngreatest) or by _Whistling_, or by _Singing_ (which are allow'd Arts) or\r\nby _Hollowing_ or _Luring_ (which the Huntsman or Faulkner would have to\r\nbe an Art also) or by imitating with the Mouth (or otherwise) the Voice\r\nof any Animal, as of _Quails_, _Cats_, and the like; or by\r\n_representing_ any Sound begotten by the Collision of Solid Bodies, or\r\nafter any other manner; these are all _Improvements_ of _Direct\r\nHearing_, and may be improv'd.\r\n\r\nMoreover the Skill to make all sorts of _Musical Instruments_, both\r\nAncient and Modern, whether _Wind_ Instruments or _String'd_, or of any\r\nother sort, whereof there are very many (as _Drums_, _Bells_, the\r\n_Systrum_ of the _Egyptians_, and the like) that beget (and not only\r\npropagate) Sounds; the Skill of making these, I say, is an Art, that has\r\nas much improv'd _Direct Hearing_, as an Harmonious Sound exceeds a\r\nsingle and rude one, that is, an immusical _Tone_; which Art is yet\r\ncapable of farther improvement. And I do hope, that by the Rules, which\r\nmay happily be laid down concerning the _Nature_, _Propagation_ and\r\n_Proportion_, or _Adapting_ of Sounds, a way may be found out, both to\r\nimprove _Musical Instruments_ already in use, and to invent new ones,\r\nthat shall be more sweet and luscious, than any yet known. Besides that,\r\nby the same means _Instruments_ may be made, that shall imitate any\r\nSound in Nature, that is not Articulate, be it of Bird, Beast, or what\r\nthing else soever.\r\n\r\n2. The _Conveying_ and _Propagating_ (which is a kind of _Conserving_)\r\nof Sounds, is much help'd by _duly placing the Sonorous Body_, and also\r\nby the _Medium_.\r\n\r\nFor if the Medium be _Thin_ and _Quiescent_, and the Sounding Body\r\n_plac'd conveniently_, the Sound will be easily and regularly\r\npropagated, and mightily conserv'd. I say,\r\n\r\n1. If the _Medium be Thin and Quiescent_, because it otherwise causes a\r\n_Refracted Sound_, of which afterwards. Hence in a _still Evening_, or\r\nthe _dead of the Night_ (when the Wind ceases) a Sound is better sent\r\nout, and to a greater distance than otherwise, tho' much of this may be\r\nascrib'd to its _Refraction_ also.\r\n\r\n2. I say, that the _Sonorous Body must be plac'd conveniently_, near a\r\n_Smooth Wall_, near _Water_, or _a Plain_, whose Surface is even.\r\n\r\n1. Near a _Smooth Wall_, either Plain or Arch'd (Cycloidically or\r\nElliptically, rather than otherwise, tho' a Circular or any Arch will\r\ndo, but not so well.)\r\n\r\nHence in a Church, the nearer the Preacher stands to the Wall (and\r\ncertainly 'tis much the best way to place Pulpits near the Wall) the\r\nbetter is he heard, especially by those who stand near the Wall also,\r\nthough at a greater distance from the Pulpit; those at the remotest end\r\nof the Church, by laying their Ears somewhat close to the Wall, may hear\r\nhim easier than those in the middle.\r\n\r\nHence also do arise _Whispering Places_. For the Voice being apply'd to\r\none end of an Arch, easily rowls to the other. And indeed were the\r\n_Motion_ and _Propagation_ of Sounds but rightly understood, 'twould be\r\nno hard matter to contrive _Whispering Places_ of infinite variety and\r\nuse. And perhaps there could be no better or more pleasant hearing a\r\n_Consort of Musick_ than at such a place as this, where the Sounds\r\nrowling along together, before they come to the Ear, must needs\r\nconsolidate and imbody into one; which becomes a true composition of\r\nSounds, and is the very Life and Soul of Consort.\r\n\r\n2. If the Sonorous Body be plac'd near _Water_, the Sound will easily be\r\nconvey'd, yet mollified; as Experience teacheth us from a Ring of\r\n_Bells_ near a River, and a great _Gun_ shot off at Sea, which yet\r\ndiffer much in the strength, and softness and continuance, or\r\npropagation of their Sounds, from the same at Land, where the Sound is\r\nmore harsh and more perishing, or much sooner decays.\r\n\r\n3. In a _Plain_ a Voice may be heard at a far greater distance than in\r\nuneven Ground.\r\n\r\nThe _Reason_ of all which last nam'd _Phænomena_ is the same; because\r\nthe Sonorous Air meeting with little or no resistance upon a _Plane_\r\n(much less upon an Arch'd) smooth Superficies, easily rowls along it,\r\nwithout being let or hinder'd in its Motion, and consequently without\r\nhaving its parts disfigured, and put into another kind of Revolution,\r\nthan what they had at the first begetting of the Sound. Which is the\r\ntrue cause of its _Preservation_ or _Progression_, and fails much when\r\nthe Air passes over an uneven Surface, according to the degrees of its\r\ninequality, and somewhat also, when it passes over the plain Superficies\r\nof a Body that is hard and resisting.\r\n\r\nWherefore the smooth Top of the Water (by reason of its yielding to the\r\nArch'd Air, and gently arising again with a kind of Resurge, like to\r\n_Elasticity_, tho' it be not so, by which Resurge it quickens and\r\nhastens the motion of the Air rowling over it, and by its yielding\r\npreserves it in its Arch'd Cycloidical or Elliptical Figure) the smooth\r\nTop of the Water, I say, for these Reasons, and by these Means, conveys\r\na Sound more entire, and to a greater distance than the plain Surface of\r\na piece of Ground, a Wall, or any other Solid Body whatever, can do.\r\n\r\nAs for the _Speaking Trumpet_, by which a Voice may be convey'd to a\r\nconsiderable distance, I refer its consideration to that of _Refracted\r\nSounds_, or _Refracted Audition_.\r\n\r\nThus much of the Improvements of Hearing, that respect its _Object_,\r\nwhich is _Sound_.\r\n\r\n2. The _Organ_ and _Medium_ are to be consider'd. And, 1. The _Organ_,\r\nwhich is the _Ear_, is helpt much by placing it near a Wall (especially\r\nat one end of an Arch, the Sound being begotten at the other) or near\r\nthe Surface of Water, or of the Earth, along which the Sounds are most\r\neasily and naturally convey'd, as was before declar'd. And 'tis\r\nincredible how far a Sound made upon the Earth (by the trampling of a\r\nTroop of Horses, for Example) may be heard in a still Night, if a Man\r\nlays his Ear close to the Ground in a large Plain.\r\n\r\n_Otacousticks_ here come in for helping the _Ear_; which may be so\r\ncontriv'd (by a right understanding the _Progression of Sounds_, which\r\nis the principal thing to be known for the due regulating all such kinds\r\nof Instruments) as that the Sound might enter the Ear without any\r\nRefraction, but as now they are generally made I refer them to\r\n_Refracted Audition_.\r\n\r\n2. As to the _Medium_, I know not how that, by any contrivance of Art,\r\ncan advantage _Direct Hearing_, otherwise than I have declar'd already\r\nin the propagation or conveyance of Sounds, though to the Refracting or\r\nReflecting of them it may very much conduce; of which presently.\r\n\r\nAnd so I have done with the first part of my present undertaking, which\r\nis the _Comparison of Direct Vision and Audition_, as to their\r\nImprovements from Art. The rest follow. Wherefore,\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Concerning _Refracted Vision_ and its Comparison, I observe, That\r\n_Refracted Vision_ is always made _Ex parte Medii_, as _Reflected_ is\r\n_ex parte Objecti_. And therefore, though _Direct Vision_ may be help'd\r\n_ex parte Objecti, Medii vel Organi_, yet _Refracted_ can be\r\nimprov'd only _ex parte Medii_, and _Reflected_ _ex parte Corporis\r\noppositi_ alone. Unless it be in a mixt or compound Vision, that is\r\n_Refracto-Reflext_, when the reflext Rays pass to the Eye through a\r\nrefracting Medium, such as the _Medium Internum_, contain'd in the Body\r\nof the Eye, always is. So that in truth, all Vision is _Refracted_ by an\r\ninternal Refraction made in _ipso Oculo_.\r\n\r\nAnd all that I have spoken of _Vision_ holds true of _Hearing_ also,\r\nboth _Refracted_ and _Reflext_, and therefore need not be repeated.\r\n\r\n_Refracted Vision_ arises from the different _Density_, _Figure_, and\r\n_Magnitude_ of the Medium, which is somewhat alter'd also by the diverse\r\nincidence of the visible Rays. And so it is in _Refracted Hearing_, all\r\nthese Causes concur to its Production, and some others to be hereafter\r\nconsider'd.\r\n\r\nNow as any Object (a Man for example) seen through a thicken'd Air, by\r\n_Refraction_ appears greater than really he is: So likewise a _Sound_,\r\nheard through the same thicken'd part of the _Atmosphere_, will be\r\nconsiderably vary'd from what it would seem to be, if heard through a\r\nthinner Medium.\r\n\r\nAnd this I call a _Refracted Sound_: But what this Refraction of Sound\r\nis, and how caus'd, may hereafter be discuss'd, when the Nature, and\r\nMotion, or Progression of Sounds are well stated.\r\n\r\nFor the Improvement of _Refracted Vision_ artificial Instruments have\r\nbeen made, by grinding or blowing Glasses, into a certain Figure, and\r\nplacing them at due distances, whereby the Object may be (as 'twere)\r\nenabled to send forth its Rays more vigorously, and the Visive Faculty\r\nimpower'd the better to receive them. And thus also Instruments may be\r\ncontriv'd for the assisting both the _Sonorous Body_, to send forth its\r\nSound more strongly, and the _Acoustick Faculty_, to receive and discern\r\nit more easily and clearly. _For_,\r\n\r\n1. As a fine _Glass Bubble_, fill'd with clear Water, and placed before\r\na burning Candle or Lamp, does help it to dart forth its Rays to a\r\nprodigious Length and Brightness: So an _Instrument_ may be invented,\r\nthat apply'd to the Mouth (or any Sonorous Body) shall send forth the\r\nVoice distinctly to as prodigious a Distance and Loudness.\r\n\r\nFor if the _Stentoro-phonecon_ (which is but a rude and unartificial\r\nInstrument) does such great feats, what might be done with one compos'd\r\naccording to the Rules of Art? whose make should comply with the Laws of\r\n_Sonorous Motion_ (which that does not) and therefore not so much\r\n_Refract_, as to alter and confound the _Tone_ of the _Voice_ and Words\r\n(as that somewhat does.)\r\n\r\nNow of what use such an Instrument might be for speaking clearly and\r\narticulately at a distance (and that without altering the Tone of the\r\nVoice) whether it be at Sea or at Land (but especially at Sea in\r\ntempestuous Weather and in the Night) is obvious to any Man to conceive.\r\n\r\n2. As Instruments have been invented to help the Eye, So likewise are\r\nthere some, and more such there may be, for the Ear.\r\n\r\n_For_,\r\n\r\n1. As _Spectacles_ and other _Glasses_ are made to help the _Purblind_\r\nand weak _Eyes_, to see at any competent distance: So there are\r\n_Otacousticks_ (and better may be made) to help weak _Ears_ to hear at a\r\nreasonable distance also. Which would be as great a help to the\r\ninfirmity of Old Age, as the other invention of Spectacles is, and\r\nperhaps greater; forasmuch as the Hearing what's spoken is of more daily\r\nuse and concern to such Men, then to be able to _read Books_ or to _view\r\nPictures_.\r\n\r\n2. As _Perspective-Glasses_ and Telescopes help the Eye to see Objects\r\nat a very great distance, which otherwise would not be discernable; in\r\nlike manner may a sort of _Otacousticks_ be so contriv'd, as that they\r\nshall receive in _Sounds_ made at a very great distance also, but with\r\nso much advantage, that the Ear shall be able to hear them, which\r\notherwise would have been _inaudible_.\r\n\r\nAnd these _Otacousticks_ in some respects would be of greater use than\r\n_Perspectives_. For whereas at Land _Perspectives_ are many times\r\nrender'd almost useless, by the interposition of Woods and Mountains,\r\nwhich hinder the Sight from reaching very far: Our _Otacousticks_ would,\r\nnotwithstanding these Obstacles, take in a Sound made some Leagues off.\r\nWhich might be of notable use in the time of War, for discovering the\r\nEnemy at a good distance, when he marches or lyes incamp'd behind a\r\nMountain or Wood, or any such place of shelter.\r\n\r\nYea, even at Sea also, where _Perspectives_ are of most use, by reason\r\nof the plainess of the Surface of the Water; yet sometimes there\r\n_Otacousticks_ may be of more benefit, when in dark hazy Weather the Air\r\nis too thick, or in Stormy Tempestuous Weather the Waves arise too high\r\nfor the _Perspective_ to be made use of.\r\n\r\nBut, whether at Sea or Land, _Perspectives_ become altogether\r\ninsignificant in the Night-time (unless it be for viewing the Stars)\r\nwhich is the chief time for using _Otacousticks_; as it is generally,\r\nfor Soldiers to take their March, when they would surprise their Enemies.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore this sort of _Otacousticks_ have then their chief use,\r\nwhen _Perspectives_ are of no use at all; besides that they may be\r\nimploy'd in the Day-time, as well as _Perspectives_, whence they may\r\n(not unfitly) be term'd _the most useful Instrument_ of the two.\r\n\r\n3. As _Microscopes_ or _Magnifying-Glasses_ help the Eye to see near\r\nObjects, that by reason of their smallness were _Invisible_ before;\r\nwhich Objects they Magnify to a strange greatness: So _Microphones_ or\r\n_Micracousticks_, that is Magnifying Ear Instruments, may be contriv'd\r\nafter that manner, that they shall render the most minute Sound in\r\nnature distinctly audible, by Magnifying it to an unconceivable loudness.\r\n\r\nBy the help hereof we may hear the different Cries and Tones, as well as\r\nby _Microscopes_ see the divers Shapes and Figures of the smallest\r\nAnimals.\r\n\r\n4. As by _Polyscopes_ or _Multiplying-Glasses_, one thing is represented\r\nto the Eye as many, whether in the same or different Shapes (for so\r\nMultiplying-Glasses may be contriv'd:) So by a _Polyphone_ or\r\n_Polyacoustick_ well order'd, one _Sound_ may be heard as many, either\r\nof the same or a different Note. Insomuch, that who uses this\r\nInstrument, he shall, at the Sound of a single Viol, seem to hear a\r\nwhole Consort and all true Harmony. By which means this Instrument has\r\nmuch the advantage of the _Polyscope_.\r\n\r\nAnd thus much may suffice for comparing the Improvements made upon\r\n_Refracted Seeing and Hearing_; I call it _Refracted Hearing_, because\r\nmade through a _Medium_, viz. thick Air, or an Instrument, through which\r\nthe Sound passing is broken or refracted.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Reflected Vision_ has been improv'd by the Invention of\r\n_Looking-glasses_ and _Polished Metals_, whether _Plane_, _Concave_, or\r\n_Convex_; and these two last, either _Spherical_, _Oval_, _Cylindrical_,\r\n_Conical_, _Hyperbolical_, or of several other shapes; all which cause a\r\ndifferent Reflection, and vary the _Phænomena_.\r\n\r\nThus also _Reflext Audition_, made by _Ecchoes_, may be improv'd, by\r\ncontriving several sorts of _Artificial Ecchoes_; as 'tis no hard matter\r\nto do in almost any place.\r\n\r\nFor (speaking in the general) _Any Sound, falling directly or obliquely\r\nupon any dense Body, of a smooth (whether Plane or Arch'd) Superficies,\r\nis beat back again and reflected, or does eccho more or less_.\r\n\r\nI say (1.) _falling directly or obliquely_; because, if the Sound be\r\nsent out and propagated parallel to the Surface of the _Dense Body_, or\r\nbe made so _far off_ and so _weak_, that it cannot reach it, there will\r\nbe no Reflection of Sound, no _Eccho_.\r\n\r\nI say (2.) _upon a Body of a smooth Superficies_; because if the Surface\r\nof the _Corpus Obstans_ be uneven, the Air by reverberation will be put\r\nout of its regular Motion, and the Sound thereby broken and\r\nextinguish'd: So that tho' in this case also the Air be beaten back\r\nagain, yet Sound is not reflected, nor is there any Eccho.\r\n\r\nI say (3.) _it does eccho more or less_, to shew, that when all things\r\nare, as is before describ'd, there is still an Ecchoing, though it be\r\nnot always heard; either because the _direct Sound_ is too weak to be\r\nbeaten quite back again to him that made it; or that it does return home\r\nto him, but so weak, that without the help of a good _Otacoustick_, it\r\ncannot be discern'd; or that he stands in a wrong place, to receive the\r\nreflected Sound, which passes over his head, under his Feet, or to one\r\nside of him; which therefore may be heard by a Man standing in that\r\nplace, where the reflected Sound will come, provided no interpos'd Body\r\ndoes intercept it; but not by him, that first made it.\r\n\r\nI shall further make out the comparison 'twixt _Reflex'd Vision_ and\r\n_Audition_, by these following _Propositions_.\r\n\r\n1. As a _Plain Speculum_ reflects the _Object_ in its due _Dimensions_\r\nand _Colours_; allowing for their difference of appearance, according to\r\ntheir distance: So a _Plane Corpus Obstans_ reflects the _Sound_ back in\r\nits due _Tone_ and _Loudness_; if allowance be likewise made for the\r\nproportionable decrease of the Sound, according to its distance.\r\n\r\n2. As a _Convex Speculum_ reflects the _Object less_, but somewhat\r\n_brighter_ or clearer: So a _Convex Corpus Obstans_ repels the Sound\r\n(insensibly) _smaller_; but somewhat _quicker_ (though _weaker_) than\r\notherwise it would be.\r\n\r\n3. As a _Concave Speculum_ reflects the Object _bigger_, more obscure\r\nand _Inverted_: So a _Concave Corpus Obstans_ ecchoes back the Sound\r\n(insensibly) _bigger_, _slower_ (though _stronger_) and also _inverted_;\r\nbut never according to the order of Words. Nor do I think it possible\r\nfor the Art of Man to contrive a _Single Eccho_, that shall invert the\r\nSound, and repeat backwards; because then the Words last spoken, that\r\nis, which do last occur to the _Corpus Obstans_, must first be repell'd;\r\nwhich cannot be: For where, in the mean time, should the first Words\r\nhang, and be conceal'd, or lie dormant? Or how, after such a pause, be\r\nreviv'd and animated again into Motion? Yet in complicated or _Compound\r\nEcchoes_, where many receive from one another, I know not whether\r\nsomething that way may not be done.\r\n\r\nFrom the determinate _Concavity_ or _Archedness_ of these reflecting\r\nBodies, it comes to pass, that some of them, from a certain distance or\r\nposture, will eccho back but one determinate Note, and from no other\r\nplace will they reverberate any; because of the undue Position of the\r\nsounding Body. Such an one (as I remember) is the Vault in _Merton_\r\nCollege in _Oxford_.\r\n\r\n4. As a _Speculum_ takes in and reflects more of its Object, when plac'd\r\nat a great distance from it, than when nearer; because it reflects\r\naccording to the apparent Magnitude of the Body at such a distance,\r\nwhich is less: So also the _Ecchoing Body_, being remov'd farther off,\r\nreflects more of the Sound, than when nearer. And this is the reason,\r\nwhy some Ecchoes repeat but one Syllable, some one Word, and some many.\r\n\r\n5. As _Specula's_ may be so plac'd, that reflecting one upon or into the\r\nother, either directly or obliquely, one Object shall appear many; as in\r\nSir _Samuel Moreland_'s Glass-room: After the same manner _Ecchoing\r\nBodies_ may be so contriv'd and plac'd, as that reflecting the Sound\r\nfrom one to the other, either directly and mutually, or obliquely and by\r\nSuccession, out of one Sound shall many Ecchoes be begotten; which in\r\nthe first case will be all together, and somewhat involv'd or swallow'd\r\nup of each other, and thereby confus'd (as a Face in Looking-glasses\r\nobverted) in the other they will be distinct, separate, and succeeding\r\none another; as most _multiple Ecchoes_ do.\r\n\r\nMoreover a _Multiple-Eccho_ may be made, by so placing the _Ecchoing\r\nBodies_, at unequal distances, that they reflect all one way, and not\r\none on the other; by which means a manifold successive Sound will be\r\nheard (not without astonishment) one Clap of the hands like many, one\r\nHa, like a laughter, one single Word like many of the same Tone and\r\nAccent, and so one Viol like many of the same kind imitating each other.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as _Specula's_ may be so order'd, that by Reflection they\r\nshall make one single thing appear many different things; as one single\r\nMan to seem many Men, differing as to Shape and Complexion (or a company\r\nof Men) which I think Sir _Samuel Moreland_'s Contrivance does not: So\r\nmay _Ecchoing Bodies_ also be order'd, that from any one Sound given,\r\nthey shall produce many Ecchoes, different both as to their _Tone_ and\r\n_Intension_. (The ground whereof has elsewhere been laid down in a\r\nTreatise concerning the _Sympathy of Lute-strings_.)\r\n\r\nBy this means a _Musical Room_ may be so contriv'd, that not only one\r\nInstrument, play'd on in it shall seem many of the same _sort_ and\r\n_size_; but even a Consort of (somewhat) different ones; only by placing\r\ncertain _Ecchoing Bodies_ so, as that any Note (play'd) shall be\r\nreturn'd by them in 3_ds_, 5_ths_, and 8_ths_, which is possible to be\r\ndone otherwise than was mention'd before in _Refracted Audition_.\r\n\r\nI have now done with my _Comparison_ of the two Noblest _Senses_, and\r\n_Sciences_, as to their _Improvements_; wherein I have been thus large,\r\nthat I might give you a little prospect into the _Excellency_ and\r\n_Usefulness_ of _Acousticks_; and that thereby I might excite all that\r\nhear me, to bend their Thoughts towards the making of Experiments for\r\nthe compleating this (yet very imperfect, tho' noble) Science; a\r\n_Specimen_ whereof I will give you in three _Problems_, and then present\r\nyou with the _Semiplane_ of an _Acoustick or Phonical Sphere_, as an\r\nAttempt to explicate the great _Principle_ in this Science, which is\r\n_The Progression of Sounds_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Problems are these:_\r\n\r\n1. _Sonum intendere quousque velis_; or, _Datum sonum ad datum gradum\r\nintendere_.\r\n\r\n2. _Sonum extendere quousque velis_; or, _Datum sonum ad datum\r\ndistantiam extendere seu propagare_.\r\n\r\n3. _Sonum transire ab extremo ad extremum_ & _non per Medium_.\r\n\r\n1. The first is, _To make the least Sound_ (by the help of Instruments)\r\n_as loud as the greatest_; a whisper to become as loud as the shot of a\r\nCannon.\r\n\r\nBy the help of this _Problem_, the most minute Sounds in Nature may be\r\nclearly and distinctly heard.\r\n\r\n2. The second is, _To propagate any_ (the least) _Sound to the greatest\r\ndistance_.\r\n\r\nBy the help hereof any Sound may be convey'd to any, and therefore heard\r\nat any distance, (I must add, within a certain, tho' very large Sphere.)\r\n\r\nMoreover, by this means, a _Weather-cock_ may be so contriv'd, as that\r\nwith an ordinary blast of Wind it shall cry (or whistle) loud enough to\r\nbe heard many Leagues: Which happily may be found of some use, not only\r\nfor _Pilots_ in mighty tempestuous Weather, when _light Houses_ are\r\nrender'd almost useless, but also for the measuring the strength of\r\nWinds, if allowance be made for their different moisture. For I\r\nconceive, that the more dry any Wind is, the louder it will whistle\r\n_cæteris paribus_; I say, _cæteris paribus_, because, besides the\r\nstrength and dryness of Winds or Breath, there are a great many other\r\nthings (hereafter to be considered) that concur to the increase or\r\nmagnifying of Sounds, begotten by them in an Instrument exposed to their\r\nViolence, or blown into.\r\n\r\n3. The third _Problem_, is, _That a Sound may be convey'd from one\r\nextreme to the other_ (or from one distant place to another) _so as not\r\nto be heard in the middle_.\r\n\r\nBy the help of this _Problem_ a Man may talk to his Friend at a very\r\nconsiderable distance, so that those in the middle space shall hear\r\nnothing of what passed betwixt them.\r\n\r\nFIG. V. TAB. III.\r\n\r\n_Semiplanum Sphæræ Phonicæ seu Acousticæ._\r\n\r\nYou are to conceive that (rude) _Semiplane_, as parallel to the\r\n_Horizon_: For if it be perpendicular thereunto, I suppose the upper\r\nextremity will be no longer _Circular_, but _Hyperbolical_, and the\r\nlower part of it suited to a greater Circle of the Earth. So that the\r\nwhole _Phonical_ Sphere (if I may so call it) will be a solid\r\n_Hyperbola_, standing upon a _Concave Spherical_ Base. I speak this\r\nconcerning _Sounds_ made (as usually they are) nigh the Earth, and whose\r\nSonorous _Medium_ has a free passage every way. For if they are\r\ngenerated high in the Air, or directed one way, the case will be\r\ndifferent; which is partly design'd in the inequality of that Draught.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A Discourse concerning the Modern _Theory_ of _Generation_, by Dr.\r\n   _George Garden_ of _Aberdeen_, being part of a Letter to Dr. _William\r\n   Musgrave_, L. L. D. Reg. Soc. S. and by him communicated the Royal\r\n   Society._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Subject I pitch upon, is that of the Formation of Animals, You know\r\nhow wide and unsatisfying Men's Conjectures were upon this Head, until\r\nthis Age, in which first the deservedly Famous Dr. _Harvey_ discovered\r\nthe proper place of the Formation of the Chick in the _Cicatricula_ of\r\nthe Egg, and the Formation of the Parts so far as was discernable by the\r\nnaked Eye; and after him _Malpighius_, by the help of exact Glasses,\r\nobserv'd the first Rudiments of it there, both before and after\r\nIncubation: And _R. de Graef_, and others, having upon many Observations\r\nconcluded, that the _Testes Fœminei_ were the Ovaries of Females, and\r\nconsequently that all Animals were _ex ovo_; they began from hence to\r\ninfer, that the Rudiments of each Animal were originally in the\r\nrespective Females, and that the Male contributed only to give a new\r\nFerment to the Mass of the Blood and Spirits, by which means a\r\nspirituous Liquor (which the Blood in its ordinary Ferment could not\r\nproduce) did insinuate it self into the same Ducts and Pores of the\r\nRudiments of those Animals, which were in greatest forwardness in the\r\nOvary, and so extend and enlarge all their Parts, and at last bring them\r\nto perfection, as Mr. _Perrault_ does ingeniously discourse in the third\r\nPart of his _Essais de Physique_; till now at last _Leowenhoek_ has\r\ndiscover'd an infinite number of _Animalcula in semine marium_ of all\r\nkinds, which has made him condemn the former Opinions about the\r\nPropagation of all Animals _ex Ovo_.\r\n\r\nNow upon comparing the Observations and Discoveries which have been made\r\nwith one another, these three things seem to me very probable. 1. That\r\nAnimals are _ex Animalculo_. 2. That these Animalcles are originally _in\r\nsemine Marium_ & _non in Fœminis_. 3. That they can never come\r\nforward, nor be formed into Animals of the respective kind, without the\r\n_Ova in Fœminis_.\r\n\r\nThe first of these seems probable from these three Observations. 1. That\r\nsome such thing has been so often observ'd by _Malpighius_, in the\r\n_Cicatricula_ of an Egg before Incubation, as the Rudiments of an Animal\r\nin the shape of a Tadpole, as may be seen in his first, and in his\r\nrepeated Observations _de formatione Pulli in Ovo_. 2. The sudden\r\nappearance and displaying of all the Parts after Incubation, makes it\r\nprobable, that they are not then actually formed out of a fluid, but\r\nthat the _Stamina_ of them have been formerly there existent, and are\r\nnow expanded. The first Part of the Chick which is discovered with the\r\nnaked Eye, is, you know, the _Punctum saliens_, and that not till three\r\ndays and nights of Incubation be past; and then, on the fifth day, the\r\nRudiments of the Head and Body do appear. This made Dr. _Harvey_\r\nconclude, that the Blood had a being before any other Part of the Body;\r\nand that from it, all the Organs of the _Fœtus_ were both form'd and\r\nnourished: But by _Malpighius_'s Observations we find that the Parts are\r\nthen only so far extended, as to be made visible to the naked Eye, and\r\nthat they were actually existent before, and discernable by Glasses.\r\nAfter an Incubation of thirty hours, are to be seen the Head, the Eyes,\r\nand the _Carina_ with the _Vertebræ_, distinct, and the Heart. After\r\nforty hours its Pulse is visible, and all the other Parts more distinct,\r\nwhich cannot be discerned by the naked Eye before the beginning of the\r\nfifth day; from whence it seems probable, that even the so early\r\ndiscovery of those Parts of the _Fœtus_ by the Microscope, is not the\r\ndiscerning of Parts newly formed, but only more dilated and extended by\r\nreceiving of Nutriment from the _Colliquamentum_; so that they seem all\r\nto have been actually existent before the Incubation of the Hen. And\r\nwhat _Swammerdam_ has discovered in the transformation of Insects, gives\r\nno small light to this; whilst he makes appear in the Explanation of the\r\n13th Table of the General History of Insects, that in those large\r\n_Eruca's_ which feed upon Cabbage, if they be taken about the time they\r\nretire to be transformed into _Aurelia's_, and plung'd often in warm\r\nWater to make a Rupture of the outer Skin, you will discern through the\r\ntransparency of their second Membrane, all the Parts of the Butterfly,\r\nthe Trunk, Wings, Feelers, _&c._ folded up. But that after the _Eruca_\r\nis chang'd into an _Aurelia_, none of these Parts can be discern'd, they\r\nare so drencht with moisture, tho' they be there actually form'd.\r\nAnother Consideration is from the Analogy, which we may suppose between\r\nPlants and Animals. All Vegetables we do see proceed _ex Plantula_, the\r\nSeeds of Vegetables being nothing else but little Plants of the same\r\nkind folded up in Coats and Membranes; and from hence we may probably\r\nconjecture, that so curiously an organized Creature as an Animal, is not\r\nthe sudden Product of a Fluid or _Colliquamentum_, but does much rather\r\nproceed from an Animalcle of the same kind, and has all its little\r\nMembers folded up according to their several Joints and Plicatures,\r\nwhich are afterwards enlarged and distended, as we see in Plants. Now\r\ntho' this Consideration alone may seem not to bear much weight; yet\r\nbeing join'd to the two former, they do mutually strengthen each other.\r\nAnd indeed all the Laws of Motion, which are as yet discovered, can give\r\nbut a very lame account of the forming of a Plant or Animal. We see how\r\nwretchedly _Des Cartes_ came off when he began to apply them to this\r\nSubject; they are formed by Laws yet unknown to Mankind; and it seems\r\nmost probable, that the _Stamina_ of all the Plants and Animals that\r\nhave been, or ever shall be in the World, have been form'd, _ab Origine\r\nMundi_, by the Almighty Creator within the first of each respective\r\nkind. And he who considers the Nature of Vision, that it does not give\r\nus the true magnitude, but the proportion of things; and that what seems\r\nto our naked Eye but a Point, may truly be made up of as many Parts as\r\nseem to us to be in the whole visible World, will not think this an\r\nabsurd or impossible thing.\r\n\r\nBut the second thing which later Discoveries have made probable, is,\r\nthat these Animalcles are originally _in Semine Marium_ & _non in\r\nFœminis_. And this I collect from these Considerations: 1. That there\r\nare innumerable _Animalcula_ discover'd _in Semine Masculo omnium\r\nAnimalium_. Mr. _Leewenhoeck_ has made this so evident by so many\r\nObservations, that I do not in the least question the truth of the\r\nthing. The reason of their Multitude, and some of the Difficulties which\r\narise thereupon, he has cleared to very good Purpose, so that I shall\r\nnot repeat them. 2. The observing the Rudiments of the _Fœtus_ in\r\nEggs, which have been fecundated by the Male, and the seeing no such\r\nthing in those which are not fecundated, as appears from _Malpighius_\r\nhis Observations, make it very probable that these Rudiments proceed\r\noriginally from the Male, and not from the Female. 3. The resemblance\r\nbetween the Rudiments of the _Fœtus in Ovo_, both before and after\r\nIncubation, and the _Animalcle_, makes it very probable, that they are\r\none and the same. The same Shape and Figure which Mr. _Leewenhoeck_\r\ngives us of the _Animalcle_, _Malpighius_ likewise gives of the\r\nRudiments of the _Fœtus_, both before and after Incubation; yea, and\r\neven the _Fœtus's_ of Animals do appear so at first to the naked Eye,\r\nso that Dr. _Harvey_ does acknowledge that all Animals, even the most\r\nperfect, are begotten of a Worm, _De Gen. Anim. Ex._ 18. 4. This gives a\r\nrational account of many _Fœtus's_ at one Birth, especially that of\r\nthe Countess of _Holland_, and how at least a whole Cluster of Eggs in a\r\nHen are fecundated by one Coition of the Male. 5. This gives a new\r\nlight, as it were, to the first Prophecy concerning the _Messiah_, that\r\nthe Seed of the Woman shall bruise the Head of the Serpent, all the rest\r\nof Mankind being thus most properly and truly the Seed of the Man.\r\n6. The Analogy I have already mentioned, which we may rationally suppose\r\nbetween the manner of the propagation of Plants and Animals, does\r\nlikewise make this probable. Every Herb and Tree bears its Seed after\r\nits kind; which Seed is nothing else but a little Plant of the same\r\nkind, which being thrown into the Earth, as into its _Uterus_, spreads\r\nforth its Roots, and receives its Nourishment, but has its form within\r\nits self, and we may rationally conjecture some such Analogy in the\r\nPropagation of Animals.\r\n\r\nThe third Particular which later Discoveries make probable, is, that\r\nAnimals cannot be formed of these _Animalcula_ without the _Ova in\r\nfœminis_, which are necessary for supplying of them with proper\r\nNutriment: And this these Considerations seem to evince. 1. It is\r\nprobable that an _Animalcle_ cannot come forward, if it do not fall into\r\na proper _Nidus_. This we see is the _Cicatricula_ in Eggs; and tho' a\r\nMillion of them should fall into an Egg, none of them would come\r\nforward, but what were in the Center of the _Cicatricula_; and perhaps\r\nthe _Nidus_ necessary for their formation is so proportion'd to their\r\nbulk, that it can hardly contain more than one _Animalcle_; and this may\r\nbe the reason why there are so few Monsters. This we see is absolutely\r\nnecessary in _Oviparis_; and the only difference which seems to be\r\nbetween them and the _Vivipara_, in this matter, is in this, that in the\r\nlatter the _Ova_ are properly nothing more but the _Cicatricula_, with\r\nits _Colliquamentum_, so that the _Fœtus_ must spread forth its Roots\r\ninto the _Uterus_ to receive its nourishment; but the Eggs in _Oviparis_\r\nmay be properly term'd an _Uterus_, in relation to the _Fœtus_; for\r\nthey contain not only the _Cicatricula_, with its _Amnion_ and the\r\n_Colliquamentum_, which is the immediate nourishment of the _Fœtus_,\r\nbut also the materials which are to be converted into that\r\n_Colliquamentum_; so that the _Fœtus_ spreads forth its Roots no\r\nfarther than into the White and Yolk of the Egg, from whence it derives\r\nall its nourishment. Now that an Animalcle cannot come forward without\r\nsome such proper _Nidus_, Mr. _Leewenhoeck_ will not readily deny; for\r\nif there were nothing needful, but their being thrown into the _Uterus_,\r\nI do not see why many hundreds of them should not come forward at once;\r\nfor as to what Mr. _Leewenhoeck_ says, that one of them would be-dwarf\r\nand choak the rest; this might fall out in process of time: But at first\r\nI do not see why many of them should not grow together, whilst scatter'd\r\nin so large a Field (and yet no such thing is observed) if there were\r\nnot an absolute necessity of a _Cicatricula_ for their growth and\r\nthriving. Now, 2. That this _Cicatricula_ is not originally in _Utero_,\r\nseems evident from the frequent Conceptions which have been found _extra\r\nUterum_: Such as the Child which continued Twenty six Years in the Woman\r\nof _Tholouse_'s Belly, mention'd _Numb._ 139. of the _Philos. Trans._\r\nAnd the little _Fœtus_ found in the _Abdomen de St. Mere_, together\r\nwith the Testicle torn and full of clotted Blood, recorded _Numb._ 150.\r\nboth taken out of the Journals _des Savans_: Such also seem to be the\r\n_Fœtus_ in the _Abdomen_ of the Woman of _Copenhagen_, mention'd in\r\nthe _Nouvelles des Lettres_, for _Sept._ 85. _pag._ 996. all the Members\r\nof which were easily to be felt through the Skin of the Belly, and which\r\nshe had carried in her Belly for four Years; and the seven Years\r\nGravidation, related by Dr. _Cole_, _Numb._ 172. of the _Transact._ That\r\nthese two were undoubtedly _extra Uterum_, is uncertain, because the\r\nlast was not open'd after her death, and the former may be yet still\r\nalive. Now granting once the necessity of a proper _Nidus_, for the\r\nformation of an Animalcle into the Animal of its respective kind; these\r\nObservations make it probable, that the _Testes_ are the _Ovaria_\r\nappropriated for this use; for tho' the Animalcles coming thither in\r\nsuch Cases may seem to be extraordinary, and that usually the\r\nImpregnation is in _Utero_; yet it may be collected from hence, that the\r\n_Cicatriculæ_ or _Ova_ to be impregnated, are in _Testibus fœmineis_;\r\nfor if it were not so, the accidental coming of Animalcles thither could\r\nnot make them come forward more than in any other part of the Body,\r\nsince they cannot be formed and nourished without a proper _Nidus_. But\r\n3. It is acknowledg'd by all, that the _Fœtus in Utero_, for some\r\nconsiderable time after Conception, has no connexion with the Womb, that\r\nit sits wholly loose to it, and is perfectly a little round Egg with the\r\n_Fœtus_ in the midst, which sends forth its Umbilical Vessels by\r\ndegrees, and at last lays hold on the _Uterus_. Now from hence it seems\r\nevident, that the _Cicatricula_, which is the Fountain of the Animalcles\r\nnourishment, does not sprout from the _Uterus_, but has its _Origin_\r\nelsewhere, and falls in thither as into a fit Soil, from whence it may\r\ndraw Nutriment for the growth of the _Fœtus_, else it cannot be\r\neasily imagin'd, how it should not have an immediate Connexion with the\r\n_Uterus_ from the time of Conception. If you join all these three\r\nConsiderations together, _viz._ that an _Animalcle_ cannot come forward\r\nwithout a proper _Nidus_ or _Cicatricula_; that there have been frequent\r\n_Fœtus's extra Uterum_; and that they have no _Adhæsion_ to the\r\n_Uterus_, for a considerable time after Conception, they seem to make it\r\nevident, that Animals cannot be form'd _ex Animalculis_ without the _Ova\r\nin Fœminis_. To all these I shall subjoin the Proposal of an\r\n_Experimentum Crucis_, which may seem to determine, whether the _Testes\r\nFœmineæ_ be truly the _Ovaria_, _viz._ Open the _Abdomen_ of the\r\nFemales of some kinds, and cut out these Testicles, and this will\r\ndetermine, whether they be absolutely necessary for the formation of\r\nAnimals.\r\n\r\nThere are some Difficulties proposed against this Conjecture, which I\r\nthink may be easily resolved. Some object the distance between the\r\n_Tubæ_ or _Cornua Uteri_, and the Testicles; but to this is opposed by\r\n_Swammerdam_, and others, the like distance between the _Infundibulum_,\r\nin Hens and Frogs, and the Ovary; and yet it cannot be denied that the\r\nEggs are transmitted thro' this into the _Uterus_: And besides _R. de\r\nGraef_, and others, have by repeated Observations found that the _Cornua\r\nUteri_ do at certain times after Conception, embrace the _Testes_ on\r\nboth sides the _Uterus_. They object in the second place the great\r\ndisproportion between the pretended Eggs in the _Ovary_, and the\r\nAperture of the _Tubæ_ or _Cornua Uteri_, the former being a great deal\r\nbigger than the latter: But both _R. de Graef_ and _Malpighius_ have\r\nclear'd that Matter, by making appear, that these Bladders in the Ovary\r\nare not the _Ova_, but serve to form the _Glandules_ within which the\r\n_Ova_ are formed, which break through a small _Papilla_ opening in the\r\n_Glandule_, which bears a proportion to the Aperture of the Tube. They\r\nobject 3, The difficulty to conceive how these Eggs should be\r\nimpregnated _per semen Maris_, both because there is no Connexion\r\nbetween the _Tubæ_ and the _Ovary_ for its transmission, and for that\r\nDr. _Harvey_ could never discover any thing of it _in Utero_. As to the\r\nlast, Mr. _Leewenhoeck_ has cleared that difficulty, by the discovery of\r\ninnumerable _Animalcula Seminis Maris in Cornubus Uteri_, and those\r\nliving a considerable time after Coition. _Numb._ 174. of the\r\n_Transact._ And as to the former, we may either suppose that there is\r\nsuch an Inflation of the _Tubæ_ or _Cornua Uteri tempore Coitionis_, as\r\nmakes them embrace the _Ovaria_, and such an approach of the _Uterus_\r\nand its _Cornua_, as that I may easily transmit the Seed into the\r\n_Ovary_; or else, that the _Ova_ are impregnated by the Animalcles after\r\nthey descend into the _Uterus_, and not in the _Ovary_; the former seems\r\nprobable for this Reason, that at least a whole Cluster of Eggs in a Hen\r\nwill be fecundated by one Tread of the Cock: Now this Fecundation seems\r\nto be in the Vitellary, and not in the _Uterus_, as the Eggs pass along\r\nfrom day to day; for it can hardly be supposed that the Animalcles\r\nshould subsist so long, being scattered loosely in the _Uterus_, as to\r\nwait there for many days for the Fecundation of the Eggs as they pass\r\nalong. The latter Conjecture has this to strengthen it, that the\r\nAnimalcles are found to live a considerable time in the _Uterus_; and\r\nthat if they should impregnate the _Ova_ in the Ovary it self, the\r\n_Fœtus_ would increase so fast, that the _Ova_ could not pass through\r\nthe _Tubæ Uteri_, but would either burst the Ovary, or fall down into\r\nthe Abdomen from the Orifices of the _Tubæ_; and that from hence proceed\r\nthose extraordinary Conceptions in _Abdomine extra Uterum_. But, 4. Mr.\r\n_Leewehoeck_, _Numb._ 147. of the _Transact._ to weaken the third\r\nConsideration about the Conceptions, being like unto an _Ovum_ in the\r\nWomb, proposes a Parallel between these Animalcles and Insects; and\r\ninsinuates, that as the latter cast their Skins, and appear of another\r\nShape, so the other which at first seem like Tadpoles, may cast their\r\nouter Skin, and then be round; and that this may be the occasion of the\r\nround Figure of the Conception in the Womb. To this it may be replied,\r\nthat according to Mr. _Leewenhoeck_'s own Sentiment, the Animalcles\r\ncannot come forward, if they do not find the _Punctum_ or proper place\r\nfor their Nourishment, to which it seems they must have some _Adhæsion_.\r\nNow the Conception in _Viviparis_ is not fastned unto the Womb for many\r\ndays, nor does adhere to any point of it; so that it seems this roundish\r\nBody is not the Animalcle thus chang'd after having cast an outer Skin,\r\nbut is rather the _Cicatricula_ or little Egg, into which the Animalcle\r\nhas entred as its _Punctum_ or place of nourishment; else I do not see\r\nwhy they should not be adhering to the Womb from the first Conception,\r\nor why (as I have said) many hundreds of them are not conceiv'd and\r\nformed together, _&c._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A short Discourse concerning Concoction: Read at a Meeting of the Royal\r\n   Society, _May ... 1699_, by _Clopton Havers_, M. D. Fellow of the\r\n   Royal Society._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the Digestion of the Aliment is performed, is a\r\nthing not very easie to be understood and explained. However, it has not\r\nescap'd the Conjectures of some Philosophical Men, who having curiously\r\nobserv'd the _Phænomena_ of Nature, and enquired into their Causes,\r\nhave, amongst other things, endeavour'd to account for this. But their\r\nSentiments about it have been various, and the Hypothesis, by which they\r\nhave studied to explain it, very different. Some have thought the\r\nConcoction of the Food to be a kind of Elixation; and that the grosser\r\nand more solid Parts being, as it were, boil'd in the Liquid by the Heat\r\nof the Stomach, and the Parts adjacent to it, as the Liver, Spleen, and\r\nOmentum, are by a long and continued Elixation, first render'd more\r\ntender, and then colliquated, and dissolved into minuter Particles, so\r\nas to mix more equally with the Fluid, and with that to make one\r\nPulpament, or chylous Mass. And _Hippocrates_, tho' he does not plainly\r\ncall it an Elixation, yet seems to attribute the Concoction of the Food\r\nto the Heat of the Stomach, as the Cause of it, _Sect. 4. Libro de\r\nsalubri victus ratione_. So where he takes notice of the voiding of such\r\nFæces, as appear to be like the Food that has been eaten; he adds,\r\n_Constat enim, sane ventriculum, ciborum copiam, ut concoquat,\r\ncalefacere non posse_. And there are other Passages in the same Book,\r\nfrom which we may conclude, that he suppos'd the Heat of the Stomach to\r\nbe the great Cause of the Digestion of the Food.\r\n\r\nThere are others that make the Stomach itself to be the great Instrument\r\nof Digestion, but in a different manner: And they suppose it to be\r\nperform'd by an Attrition, as if the Stomach, by those repeated Motions,\r\nwhich are the necessary Effects of Respiration, when it is distended by\r\nthe Aliment, did both rub or grind off some minuter Particles from the\r\ngrosser Parts; and by continually agitating the Mass of Food, make those\r\nParts, which are not contiguous to the Stomach, strike one against\r\nanother, and break one another in pieces, until they are all attenuated.\r\nIt is evident enough, that the sides of the Stomach do in Expiration\r\npress upon the _Contenta_, so as to oblige, at least some Parts of them,\r\nevery time the Muscles of the Abdomen are contracted, to move and shift\r\ntheir places. So in Inspiration, when the Diaphragm and Liver press upon\r\nthe upper part of the Stomach, the Aliment must be moved again. So that\r\nby these reciprocal Motions, that part of the Food which is contiguous\r\nto the Stomach, and moves in a Line parallel to it, must rub against it;\r\nand all the other Parts being moved by such a Compression, as gives them\r\na different Tendency, it is certain they must be continually striking\r\none against another. And for Bread, and such things as are made of\r\nFlower, that will be softned and dissolv'd with any common Liquid, that\r\nAgitation of the Stomach which moves them in Respiration, might seem\r\nsufficient to break and dissolve them, when they are sufficiently\r\nmoisten'd with a Fluid. Yet this cannot be thought enough to break and\r\ndigest Flesh-meat, Fruits, or any other thing that will not be softned\r\nand dissolv'd in Water, or some such Liquid. But although this Motion of\r\nthe Aliment, caused by Respiration, does not actually digest it, yet it\r\nhas a great and necessary Use in Concoction, and makes all the grosser\r\nParts, as they are attenuated, mix equally with the Fluid.\r\n\r\nSome think that the Bilious Juice; others, that the Spirits are chiefly\r\nconcern'd in this Affair. _Galen_, in his Book _de Neutralibus\r\nFacultatibus_, makes it to be the Effect, not of one, but of several\r\nCauses; as a pituitous Juice in the Stomach, the Bile, _&c._ which\r\nappears from what he has said, and the Translator thus render'd: '_Verum\r\nquanto ii (cibi) qui mansi sunt, iis, qui inhæserunt, magis sunt\r\nalterati; tanto etiam his magis ii, qui devorati sunt. Siquidem\r\nincomparabilis erit horum alterationis excessus, si & quæ in ventre est\r\nPituita & Bilis, & Spiritus, & Calor, & tota Ventris substantia,\r\næstimentur._'\r\n\r\nSome there are that will have the Food to be dissolv'd by a Menstruum,\r\nwhich is supply'd from the Glands of the Stomach, or some other way: But\r\nthose that do so far agree in the General, as to think Concoction is\r\nperform'd by a Dissolvent, do differ in their Notions of the Nature of\r\nthe Menstruum: For there are some that suppose it to be an Acid, which\r\ndoes erode the grosser parts of the Food, and dissolves them in the same\r\nmanner as Vinegar, Spirit of Vitriol, or any such-like Acid, will\r\ndissolve even so solid a Body as Iron. And it cannot be deny'd, but that\r\nOil of Vitriol will dissolve Flesh-meat, and reduce it to a Pulp; but it\r\nis not to be suppos'd, that the Fibres of the Stomach can admit any such\r\nstrong and corroding Acid, without something to correct it, but it must\r\nbe injur'd in its Tone, and labour under great and extraordinary Pains.\r\nNeither does such a Menstruum, tho' it will digest some things, seem\r\ncapable of dissolving so great a Variety of Things as we eat, especially\r\nwhen a great many of them are of a contrary Nature. Some will have the\r\nMenstruum to be a _nitro-aerius_ Spirit, that is, quick, and very\r\npenetrating, and included in its proper Vehicle; which, being in its own\r\nNature apt to penetrate the Mass of the Aliment, does diffuse it self\r\nthrough the Whole, and breaking the Vinculum of the more solid Parts,\r\ndoes dissolve their Compages. By others, it is thought to be some saline\r\nJuice in the Stomach, by which the Parts of the Aliment are divided and\r\ndissolved, and those which are fit for Nourishment, are volatiliz'd.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, There are some others who reject the Opinions I have already\r\nmention'd, and suppose the Digestion of the Food to be perform'd by the\r\nBenefit of a Ferment; which, when it is mixed with the Aliment, excites\r\nin the Mass an intestine motion; and the different and contrary motions\r\nand tendency of the Parts, making some kind of Collision, gradually\r\nbreak off Particles from the grosser, and more solid Parts, till they\r\nare so attenuated as to be apt to mix more equally with the Fluid, and\r\nwith them to make one soft or chylous Substance. But yet there is not\r\namongst them an universal Consent, either about the Nature of this\r\nFerment, or the manner how it is supply'd. For first, some think it to\r\nbe the Remains of the Food that was last digested; which having lain\r\nsome time in the Stomach, after the rest is carried down into the\r\nIntestines, contracts an Acid, or some other Quality, and is so alter'd,\r\nas to partake of the Nature of a Leaven. And this Leaven being a part of\r\nthe Food, which has been already digested, is so soft and liquid as to\r\nbe capable of mixing with the Aliment, which is next taken into the\r\nStomach; and being agitated with it by the repeated Pressures of the\r\nDiaphragm, Liver, and Abdominal Muscles upon the Stomach in Respiration,\r\ndoes diffuse it self through the whole Mass; and being mixed with it,\r\nlike Leaven, or Yest added to new Wort, _&c._ puts it into a State of\r\nFermentation; and by this Fermentation, or the Expansion of the Ferment,\r\nand the more tenuious Parts, which are first put into motion by it,\r\nthose which are more solid, and with which they are intermixed, are\r\nrent, and divided, and so attenuated, as to become a soft and pulpous\r\nmatter. And altho' the greatest part of the Food, that is thus broken\r\nand concocted, is by the Contraction of the Fibres of the Stomach\r\npress'd into the Duodenum; yet they do not contract themselves so as to\r\nforce out all the Aliment, but leave between the _Rugæ_ or Folds, on the\r\ninside of the Stomach, a sufficient Quantity to be a Leaven to the next\r\nMeal; and so from time to time.\r\n\r\nSome have a Notion, That this Ferment, or Principle of Fermentation, is\r\nin the Aliment it self; which being a Congeries of Matter, consisting of\r\nvarious Parts of a different Nature, is no sooner enclosed in the\r\nStomach, and digested in the Heat of that, and the adjacent Parts, but\r\nthe more spirituous and subtil Particles are put into motion both from\r\nthat Warmth, and the difference of their Natures, and enter upon a\r\nFermentation. And so by their intestine Commotion, and the Violence they\r\noffer to those Parts which oppose the tendency of any of them, they\r\nbreak and dissolve what is more solid.\r\n\r\nAgain: Some suppose, that this Ferment is supply'd from the Glands of\r\nthe Stomach.\r\n\r\nAnd Lastly, Others, and perhaps with much better Reason, contend for the\r\nSaliva, and make that to be the Ferment, which serves principally for\r\nthe Digestion of the Food; which in Mastication being mix'd with our\r\nAliment, is with that carried down into the Stomach, where the Parts of\r\nit being put into motion by a kindly and agreeable Heat, they do ferment\r\nwith, and exagitate first those Parts of the Food which are most apt to\r\nferment with it, and then both conspire to break and dissolve the\r\ngrosser and more stubborn Parts. And _Galen_, in the Book I have\r\nbefore-mention'd, plainly allows that the _Saliva_ is concern'd in the\r\nbusiness of Concoction, tho' he supposes the Alteration, which is\r\nproduc'd by this Juice, to be made in the Mouth, as appears from these\r\nWords: _Quæ (alteratio) in ore agitur mutat quidem id (nutrimentum) in\r\nalteram speciem manifestè, non tamen ad perfectionem transmutat--Qui\r\nmansi sunt cibi primum quidem hac Pituita (oris) imbuunter, & cum ea\r\nmiscentur----Itaque majorem mutationem consecuti sunt, quam ii, qui in\r\nvacuis dentium intervallis fuere impacti_.\r\n\r\nNow I have given this short Account of the various Opinions of some\r\nIngenious Men, concerning the manner how Concoction is perform'd; I come\r\nnow to propose my own Hypothesis, by which I shall endeavour to explain\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to the more easie and effectual Digestion of the Food, Nature\r\nhas appointed some Parts for the breaking our Aliment, and reducing\r\nwhatever is gross into smaller Parts, before it is put upon Digestion:\r\nOthers to supply the Ferment, by which it is to be dissolv'd and\r\nconcocted, and which, before it comes to be included in the Stomach,\r\ndoes moisten, and make it more soft, that it may more easily be\r\npenetrated, and broken by those Parts which serve to divide every Morsel\r\ninto smaller Pieces, and prevents the Inconvenience and Trouble which\r\nwould arise from the Nourishment sticking about or between them, when it\r\nis dry or viscous.\r\n\r\nFor the breaking of that part of our Food, which is not liquid, Nature\r\nhas furnish'd us with Teeth, and those of two sorts: For some are\r\nordain'd to divide and break off smaller Morsels from a larger Mass;\r\nothers are made for the grinding those Morsels into much smaller parts.\r\nThe Teeth, which serve to break off Pieces of a convenient Magnitude\r\nfrom a larger Mass, are of two sorts, accommodated to the Nature of the\r\nSubstance which we eat. These are the _Incisores_, and the _Dentes\r\nCanini_. If the Substance, which we have to eat, be not hard, but more\r\neasily penetrated and divided, then the _Incisores_ are capable of\r\nmaking an Impression upon it, and fix'd firmly enough in the Jaws to\r\nbreak off that part which they take hold of. But if it be more solid,\r\nand not easily penetrated, nor any Piece without difficulty to be\r\nseparated from that Body, whereof it is a part; then we apply the\r\n_Dentes Canini_, or Eye-Teeth, to it, which are not spread, nor have\r\nsuch an edge as the _Incisores_, but are sharp and pointed like an Awl,\r\nand so do more readily penetrate a Substance that is hard, and which the\r\n_Incisores_ can scarcely make any Impression upon. And as the Parts of a\r\nmore solid Body are commonly with more difficulty separated, and there\r\nmust be a greater stress put upon those Teeth which pull it into pieces;\r\nso these Teeth are much more firmly fixed in the Jaws than the\r\n_Incisores_, tho' they have but one single Root. Besides, the Position\r\nof all these Teeth is accommodated to their use, as being planted\r\nopposite to the Aperture of the Mouth; so that they may be conveniently\r\napply'd to the Substance which we have to eat, before it is broken, and\r\nwhen it is too large to be admitted within the Mouth.\r\n\r\nThe Teeth which do by a Compression and Attrition reduce the little\r\nMorsels to smaller Parts, are from the manner in which they break the\r\nAliment, called _Dentes Molares_, because they do, like so many\r\nMill-stones, grind the Food between them. And that they might be\r\nrender'd fit for this purpose, they are made broad at that Extremity,\r\nwhich stands out of the Gums, by which means they retain some Quantity\r\nof the Food between them every time the lower Jaw is pulled up and\r\nforc'd against the _Maxilla superior_. And as they are broad, so they\r\nare formed with Inequalities and Protuberances; and by the motion of the\r\nlower Jaw, from one side towards the other, they grind what they have\r\nbetween them into pieces. The Position of these Teeth too is as\r\nconvenient as that of the _Incisores_, and the _Dentes Canini_: For\r\nbeing design'd to break those pieces of our solid Food, which are taken\r\ninto the Mouth, and these pieces, when they are compress'd, and mov'd by\r\nthe _Dentes Molares_, being apt to fly out of the Mouth, if there were\r\nno Contrivance to prevent it, they are placed beyond the Aperture of the\r\nMouth, and opposite to the Cheeks, which keep the Food within that\r\nCavity, and not only so, but press it in between the _Dentes Molares_ on\r\none side, as the Tongue does on the other, until they have sufficiently\r\nbroken and divided it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, whilst the _Dentes Molares_ are breaking the Food,\r\nthere flows into the Mouth a Salival Juice, which mixes with it, and not\r\nonly serves to moisten it, and to render it more apt and easie to be\r\ndivided, but seems to be the Ferment, by the Benefit of which the Food\r\nis dissolved and digested. And therefore it is intimately mixed with it,\r\nby the Teeth agitating or stirring them together in Mastication.\r\n\r\nThis Liquor, which we commonly call the _Saliva_, or Spittle, seems to\r\nbe a Composition made of two several Juices, very different in their\r\nNature: And therefore the several Parts of it are separated by their\r\nproper Glands, and Nature has planted no fewer than four Pair about the\r\nMouth, which supply the Juices that make the _Saliva_; to wit, the\r\n_Parotides_, and the _Glandulæ Nuckianæ_, the _Glandulæ Maxillares\r\ninternæ_, and _Sublinguales_. Whereas if the _Saliva_ were but one more\r\nsimple Liquor, a less number of Glands might have been sufficient. At\r\nleast there appears no Reason why one of every Pair should disembogue\r\nitself into the Mouth so very near to the Orifice, by which a Gland of\r\nsome other Pair throws in its Juice; and they are not rather all planted\r\nat more equal distances from one another, so to flow in upon every part\r\nof the Aliment at the same time.\r\n\r\nNot that I suppose, as there are four Pair of salivatory Glands, so\r\nthere are four sorts of Juices supply'd from them, to make the _Saliva_;\r\nbut, as I hinted before, that there are only two different Juices that\r\nconstitute it. And these are not only sufficient, but more proper to\r\nexcite and secure that Fermentation, which is necessary to Concoction.\r\nFor we find that most of those Fermentations, which arise upon Mixtures\r\nmade for Experiments, are produced from the mixture of two things; and\r\nit is not so easie to find out three or four such Liquors of a different\r\nNature, as will, upon the mixtion of them all, produce a Fermentation,\r\nand from the omission of any one of them discover no Discord or\r\nDisposition to ferment: Besides, it is certain that two do better secure\r\nthe End, which Nature designs. For, if there were three or four\r\ndifferent Juices, of which the _Saliva_ naturally consists, these must\r\nall have their proper Qualities preserved to them, or else the\r\nFermentation, which should arise between them, will not necessarily\r\nfollow upon their mixture; and it is certain, that there would be more\r\nDanger, that one of three or four should be deprived of its Natural\r\nQuality, than one of two.\r\n\r\nWhat Nature these two Juices are of, I do not pretend positively to\r\ndetermine; but so far as I have been able to make my Conjectures about\r\nit from Experiments, I do think one of them to be an acid Juice; the\r\nother an oleaginous Liquor, something like Oil of Turpentine. For\r\namongst the many Experiments I have made, there was no one that gave me\r\nso much Satisfaction, as that which I made with Oil of Turpentine, and\r\nOil of Vitriol, though I try'd several other things, that will produce a\r\nFermentation upon their Mixture. And it was for this Reason, that I made\r\nthe Experiment with Oil of Turpentine and the other Oil.\r\n\r\nI took a piece of raw Flesh, and having cut it into pieces, but much\r\nlarger than what our more solid Food is reduc'd to by due Mastication, I\r\nmix'd some Crums of Bread with it, then I pour'd in the Oil of\r\nTurpentine to them, and upon that the Oil of Vitriol; and having shak'd\r\nthem together, I digested them about four Hours in _Balneo Mariæ_, and\r\nthen shaking them again in the Glass, I found the Meat dissolv'd, and\r\nthey all became a thickish Pulp. I could not but take notice, that Oil\r\nof Camphire (though it does not otherwise seem much different in its\r\nNature from Oil of Turpentine) and Oil of Vitriol, which upon mixture\r\nwill produce an Effervescence as well as the Oil of Turpentine and Oil\r\nof Vitriol, yet did not touch the Meat, upon which I poured them, so as\r\nin the least to dissolve them. I cannot deny but that an Acid, and a\r\nSolution of Salt of Tartar, did dissolve some part of the Flesh-meat,\r\nwhich I mix'd them with, but yet neither so soon, nor so perfectly as\r\nthe two forementioned Oils. And I do the rather think one of those\r\nJuices, which constitute the _Saliva_, to be of the Nature of Oil of\r\nTurpentine, than of a fix'd Salt, because it will correct and temper\r\neven Oil of Vitriol, so as to render it more tolerable to the Fibres of\r\nthe Stomach. Not that I suppose the acid part of the _Saliva_ to come\r\nnear to the Acidity of Oil of Vitriol. For though, when they are mix'd,\r\nthey will make a Liquor that may not be injurious to the Stomach; yet\r\nthe acid Juice, if it were so corrosive as Oil of Vitriol, would\r\ncertainly be injurious and painful to the Salivatory Ducts, which convey\r\nit to the Mouth before it is mix'd with the oleaginous Liquor. But I\r\nonly say it is an Acid, and in some degree approaches to the Nature of\r\nthat Oil. And Nature, which can much better adapt several Causes for the\r\nProduction of such an Effect than Art, may attain her End by a more\r\ntemperate Acid; though, at the same time, we may be able to make some\r\nprobable and true Conjectures about the Nature of those Causes from\r\nExperiments.\r\n\r\nIt being most reasonable to suppose, that there are but two sorts of\r\nJuices, of a different Quality, that make the _Saliva_, I do conceive,\r\nthat four of the eight Salivatory Glands, or two Pair of the four, do\r\nsupply one of these Juices, and the other four Glands the other. And\r\nthis seems to be a very good Reason, why they are so planted, and the\r\nOrifice of their Ducts so order'd, that the Juice, which is supply'd by\r\none Gland, is discharg'd into the Mouth, very near to the Orifice, by\r\nwhich the Juice of a different Nature is transmitted from another, so\r\nthat they must necessarily meet and mix together. Thus the _Glandulæ\r\nNuckianæ_, and _Parotides_, throw in two different Juices by Orifices,\r\nwhich open into the Mouth very near to one another; and the _Glandulæ\r\nMaxillares internæ_, and _Sublinguales_, do below supply the same kind\r\nof Juices by Orifices, that open so near to one another as to secure the\r\nmixture of the two different Juices.\r\n\r\nThese Glands, I say, do between them afford two divers sorts of Liquors,\r\nof such a Nature as are apt to ferment upon their first Mixture, but\r\nperhaps more considerably when they come to be digested by the Heat of\r\nthe Stomach. So that the Colluctation, or Fermentation, which attenuates\r\nand concocts the Food in the Stomach, does not ordinarily arise between\r\nthe Aliment and the _Saliva_, but between the several Parts of the\r\n_Saliva_ it self. And indeed, if the _Saliva_ did not consist of two\r\nJuices, whose Nature is in such a manner different, as to render them\r\napt to ferment upon their mixture, it would be very hard to conceive how\r\nit should so readily and indifferently serve for the Digestion of all\r\nEatables; how it should ferment with, and dissolve so great a variety of\r\nThings, not only of a different, but of a contrary Nature; how it should\r\nferment with Acids as well as Alkalies, digest things that are cold, as\r\nwell as hot or temperate; some things that are salt, others that are\r\ninsipid, bitter and sweet, mucilaginous, oily, _&c._ But if we suppose,\r\nthat the Fermentation, which serves for the Digestion of the Food,\r\narises from a peculiar difference in the Nature of two Juices, which\r\nconstitute the _Saliva_, it will be easie to give a rational Account of\r\nour Concoction of innumerable things of a different Nature. And this\r\nseems to be as effectual, and a more certain way to attenuate and\r\ndissolve the grosser Parts of our Food, than if the Fermentation were\r\nmade only between the _Saliva_ and the Aliment: Besides, the _Saliva_\r\nseems to discover a Fermentation upon the mixture of its constituent\r\nJuices, even at those times when we do not actually eat; for it is\r\nalways attended with Bubbles, and a Froth, when it has not been at all\r\nagitated in the Mouth, and many of those Bubbles will remain for some\r\nconsiderable time after we have spit it out.\r\n\r\nNature therefore having appointed the _Saliva_ for the digestion of the\r\nFood, has taken care that it shall be thrown in upon the Aliment on\r\nevery side. Thus the _Glandulæ Nuckianæ_, and the _Parotides_, supply\r\ntheir Juices to that part of the Food, which lies on the outside of the\r\nGums, between the Cheeks and the Teeth, and the _Glandulæ Maxillares\r\ninternæ_, and _Sublinguales_, do bestow their Liquor upon the Meat,\r\nwhich is within the Teeth and Gums. Neither has she had a Regard only to\r\nthat Supply, which is due to all the parts of our Food, but likewise to\r\nthe mixture of the two different Juices of the _Saliva_, which is\r\nnecessary to its Fermentation. And therefore, as I have already\r\nobserv'd, the Orifices of the Ducts, which belong to one sort of Glands,\r\nare placed near the Aperture of a Duct, which conveys a Juice from one\r\nof the other Glands. So the Ducts of the _Glandulæ Nuckianæ_, and the\r\n_Ductus Stenoniani_, do on each side open into the Mouth, near one\r\nanother; and the salivatory Ducts of the _Glandulæ Sublinguales_, and\r\nthe _Maxillares internæ_, though they have distinct Orifices, empty\r\nthemselves under the same _Papillæ_, and the Juices, which are supply'd\r\nby them, meet there, and flow into the Mouth together.\r\n\r\nThe several Parts of the _Saliva_ being discharg'd into the Mouth in\r\nsuch a manner as to meet and begin a Fermentation, the _Saliva_ does,\r\npartly as it is agitated, with the Food by the Teeth, and some other\r\nparts of the Mouth; partly by its own Fluidity, insinuate it self into,\r\nand mixes with the Food, and not only moistens and softens it, but\r\nexcites the Fermentation, which is to dissolve it. And when the Aliment\r\nis thus mix'd with the _Saliva_, which serves to ferment the whole Mass,\r\nit is then to be convey'd into the Stomach, that great digestive Vessel\r\nof the Body, where the Fermentation is not only continued, but improved.\r\n\r\nThe Nourishment being convey'd into the Cavity of the Stomach, is there\r\nkept for some time in a digestive Heat, all which time it is under a\r\nFermentation, produc'd by the different Parts or Juices of the _Saliva_,\r\nwhich are mix'd with it; which Fermentation does first agitate the more\r\ntenuious or subtil parts of the Food, and puts them into motion, and so\r\nwith the Fermentation of its own, and those Alimentary Parts, which it\r\nfirst communicates a Motion to, improved by the Heat of the Stomach, the\r\n_Saliva_ must necessarily act upon the grosser Parts. For the intestine\r\nMotion, which is excited in the Mass, does not give the Particles, which\r\nare fermented, the same Tendency, but what is so various and confus'd,\r\nthat they must inevitably strike not only one against another, but\r\nagainst those which are more gross, so as to attenuate them, sometimes\r\nby a Collision, which strikes off smaller Particles from the larger\r\nParts; sometimes by a Compression, when the Particles which are in\r\nMotion, happen to strike directly against any grosser Part, on every\r\nside of it, sometimes by a kind of Explosion. For without doubt the\r\n_Saliva_, which is fluid, insinuates it self into the Interstices of the\r\nmore crass Parts of the Aliment, and whatever is agitated and expanded\r\nin those Interstices, requiring a larger space for the Freedom of its\r\nMotion, and offering a Violence to every thing that opposes its\r\nTendency, will, like Gun-powder included in a Shell, force its way out,\r\nand tear to pieces that Matter, which does endeavour to confine it.\r\n\r\nThus the grosser Parts are broken and divided, until they are at last so\r\nfar attenuated as to mix more equally with the Fluid, and with them to\r\nmake one Pulp or Chylous Mass. And although I do not apprehend how the\r\nStomach should by its reciprocal Motions in Inspiration and Expiration,\r\nbe able to break and attenuate any Matter, that will not be softned and\r\ndissolved by Agitation in a Liquid; yet it is certain that these\r\nMotions, caused by the Diaphragm and Abdominal Muscles in Respiration,\r\ndo make those Parts, which are broken off, as they are dissolv'd, mix\r\nintimately with the more Liquid; as the Meat which I digested with Oil\r\nof Turpentine, and Oil of Vitriol, did by Agitation mix more equally\r\nwith the Oils, and became a Pulpament.\r\n\r\nAs the Juices, which constitute the _Saliva_, do ferment upon their\r\nmixture, so it is probable, that from their Mixture and Fermentation\r\nthere results such a _Tertium quid_, as is apt to ferment with the Bile.\r\nAnd therefore, when the Aliment has been under the Fermentation, excited\r\nby the _Saliva_, a sufficient time, it is then thrown into the\r\n_Duodenum_, where it meets with the bilious Juice, which flows into that\r\nIntestine from the Liver, from which a new Fermentation seems to begin;\r\nand the Commotion of the Parts of the Aliment being still continued,\r\ndoes carry on the Business of Digestion until the Food is perfectly\r\nconcocted: Though it is probable, that this new Fermentation serves not\r\nonly for the more perfect Digestion of the Food, but likewise for the\r\nSeparation of the Chyle from the feculent Parts.\r\n\r\nNeither do I by a random Guess, and an ungrounded Conjecture, suppose\r\nthat from the Mixture and Fermentation of the two Juices, which\r\nconstitute the _Saliva_, there results a Matter, which is apt to ferment\r\nwith the Bile. But to me the Notion seem'd to be confirmed by an\r\nExperiment that I made. For considering with my self, that the Bile is\r\ngenerally allow'd to have much of a saponary Nature, I made a Solution\r\nof Soap in fair Water, and mix'd it with the Oils of Turpentine and\r\nVitriol first put together, and from their Mixture I observ'd a very\r\neasie and gentle Fermentation, which continued for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A Discourse concerning some Influence of _Respiration_ on the _Motion_\r\n   of the _Heart_, hitherto unobserved. By _J. Drake_, M. D. F. R. S._\r\n\r\n\r\nTho' divers accurate Treatises of the _Heart_, and its Action, have been\r\nwritten by Learned Men of several Nations, especially by two of our own\r\nCountry; the Great Dr. _Harvey_, to whose happy Sagacity this Nation\r\nowes the Glory of the Invention of the _Circulation_ of the _Blood_; and\r\nthe incomparable Dr. _Lower_, to whom we are beholden for a compleat\r\nDisplay of the _Mechanical Structure_ of the _Heart_, and a most\r\ningenious Rationale of its Action. Yet there remain several Doubts and\r\nDifficulties about it (in my Opinion) not sufficiently accounted for;\r\ntowards the resolving some of which, I shall offer what my own Thoughts\r\nhave suggested to me, and leave it to the Consideration of the Reader.\r\n\r\nThe Learned Dr. _Lower_ (whose accurate Piece on this Argument will\r\ninsure his Reputation so long as Physical Knowledge shall last in\r\nesteem) has so well accounted for the _Systole_, or Contraction of the\r\nHeart, from the _Mechanical_ Structure of it, that he seems almost to\r\nhave exhausted the Subject; and had he been as happy in discovering the\r\ntrue cause of the _Diastole_, he had left little room for the Industry\r\nand Sagacity of others about this _Viscus_.\r\n\r\nBut having judiciously and solidly explain'd the _Systole_, he contents\r\nhimself to ascribe the _Diastole_ to a motion of _Restitution_, which\r\naccount gives me no Satisfaction: Because the _Systole_ being the\r\nproper, and (as himself confesses) the only motion of the Heart, a State\r\nof _Contraction_ seems to be the natural State, and consequently without\r\nExternal Violence, it shou'd have no _Diastole_ at all.\r\n\r\nThis will appear more plain, if we consider the Circumstances of it, and\r\nits Motion, as a Muscle, with respect to other Muscles. That Contraction\r\nis the proper Action, and State of all Muscles, is evident from\r\nExperience of Fact, as well as Reason. For, if any Muscle be freed from\r\nthe power of its _Antagonist_, it is immediately _contracted_, and is\r\nnot by any Action of the Will, or Spirits, to be reduced to a State of\r\n_Dilatation_. Thus, if the _Musculi Flexores_ of any Joint be divided,\r\nthe _Extensores_ of that Joint being by that means free'd from the\r\ncontrary Action of their _Antagonists_, that Joint is immediately\r\nextended without any consent of the Will, and in that State it remains;\r\nand so _Vice versa_, if the _Extensores_ be divided. From whence it is\r\nplain, that the Muscles have no restitutive Motion, but what they derive\r\nfrom the Action of their _Antagonists_, by which they are balanc'd. Thus\r\nlikewise the _Sphincters_ of the _Gula_, _Anus_ and _Vesica_, having no\r\nproper _Antagonists_, are always in a State of Contraction, and suffer\r\nnothing to pass them, but what is forced through them by the contrary\r\nAction of some stronger Muscles, which, though not properly to be call'd\r\n_Antagonists_, yet on all necessary Occasions perform the Office of such.\r\n\r\nThat the Heart is a Muscle, furnish'd and instructed for Motion like\r\nother Muscles, is (in my Opinion at least) demonstrated beyond\r\nContradiction by Dr. _Lower_ and others. And, as it is a _Solitary_\r\nMuscle without any proper _Antagonist_, and not directly under the power\r\nof the Will, nor exercising _Voluntary_ Motion, it approaches nearest to\r\nthe _Sphincter_ kind, which only has these Conditions in common with it.\r\nBut in constant and regular Alternations of Contraction and Dilatation,\r\nit differs exceedingly from all the Muscles of the Body.\r\n\r\nThis _reciprocal Æstus_ of the Heart has given the Learned abundance of\r\ntrouble; who, finding nothing peculiar in the Structure, which shou'd\r\nnecessarily occasion it, nor any _Antagonist_, whose re-action should\r\nproduce it, have been extreamly perplex'd to find out the cause of it.\r\n\r\nBut passing over the various Opinions of Authors, to avoid being\r\ntedious, I shall take notice here only of the very Learned Dr.\r\n_Lower_'s, in whose Account of the _Systole_, however solid and\r\ningenious, I observe something deficient, and whose _Hypothesis_ of the\r\n_Diastole_ I think to be precarious and false.\r\n\r\nThis Excellent Author, having by sound Arguments drawn from the\r\nStructure and Mechanism of the Heart, establish'd the Certainty of its\r\n_Muscular Motion_, rests satisfied, without taking notice of any\r\nAssistance, that the Heart receives from any other Part, except from the\r\nBrain, by the means of the eight pair of Nerves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Part_ 2_d_. _Prop._ 67. _Prop._ 73.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Prop._ 76.]\r\n\r\nThe Accurate _Borellus_, in his _Oeconomia Animalis_, computes the\r\n_Motive_ Power of the _Machine_ of the Heart to be equal to, or to\r\nsurmount that of a Weight of 3000_l._ The _Obstacles_ to the Motion of\r\nthe Blood thro' the _Arteries_ he esteems equivalent to 180,000_l._\r\nwhich is 60 times as much as he rates the Force of the Heart at. Then\r\ndeducting 45,000_l._ for the adventitious Help of the _Muscular Elastic\r\nCoat_ of the _Arteries_, he leaves the Heart with a Force of 3,000_l._\r\nto overcome a resistance of 135,000_l._ that is, with 1, to remove 45.\r\n\r\nThis stupendous Effect he contents himself to ascribe to the _Energy_ of\r\n_Percussion_. But, had he proceeded in his Calculation to the Veins,\r\nwhich he allows to contain constantly a quantity of Blood, quadruple to\r\nthe Contents of the Arteries, and to which this _Energy_ of _Percussion_\r\ndoes either not reach at all, or but very languidly, he might probably\r\nhave seen a necessity for some other Expedient to remove so insuperable\r\na Difficulty.\r\n\r\nBut not to insist rigorously on the Exactness of this Calculation,\r\n(though the great Abilities of the Author in this way, and his Ingenuity\r\nand Modesty, are a sufficient Warrant for the Accuracy of his\r\nComputations, and the Fidelity of his Accounts) we may allow a much\r\ngreater Deduction, than would be justifiable, without lessening the\r\nDifficulty. But this Account I have taken notice of purely for the sake\r\nof the Calculation, which may be of use in the Sequel; the account it\r\nself being in other respects more defective than Dr. _Lower_'s, to which\r\nwe will return.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, notwithstanding his great Sagacity, appears (to me) to have\r\noverlook'd something of very great moment, and importance in the\r\nexplication of the Action of the Heart. For, tho' it should be granted,\r\nthat the _Muscular Fibres_ of the Heart acted by the Nerves, are the\r\nimmediate Instruments of its _Constriction_ or _Systole_, yet it must\r\nnot be denied, that the _Intercostal_ Muscles and _Diaphragm_ are of\r\ngreat service to aid and facilitate this Contraction, by opening a\r\nPassage for the Blood through the Lungs, which denied would be an\r\ninvincible Obstacle.\r\n\r\nNeither do they promote it that way only. The manner how they farther\r\nassist the Heart in its Contraction, will appear manifestly, if we\r\nconsider the different Posture, Situation, and Capacity of the\r\nBlood-Vessels of the Lungs in the several times of _Elevation_ and\r\n_Depression_ of the _Costæ_.\r\n\r\nThe _Pulmonary_ Artery rises from the _right_ Ventricle of the Heart,\r\nand runs in one Trunk, till it comes to the _Aspera Arteria_, where it\r\nis divided, and sends a Branch along with each Division of the _Aspera\r\nArteria_, according to all the minutest Subdivisions, of which it is\r\nlikewise subdivided, accompanying all the _Bronchi_, in their whole\r\nprogress through the Lungs.\r\n\r\nThe _Pulmonary_ Vein, which empties itself into the _Left_ Ventricle of\r\nthe Heart, spreads it self on the _Aspera Arteria_ and _Bronchi_, in the\r\nsame manner that the Artery does.\r\n\r\nThe necessary confluence of this Disposition if, that this Artery and\r\nVein being co-extended with, and fasten'd to the _Bronchi_, must needs\r\nsuffer such alteration of _Superficial_ Dimensions, as the _Bronchi_ do\r\nin the _Elevation_ or _Depression_ of the _Costæ_.\r\n\r\nWhile the Ribs are in a State of _Depression_ (whether before Commerce\r\nwith the External Air or after) the _Annular Cartilages_ of the\r\n_Bronchi_ shrink one into another, and by that means their _Dimensions_\r\nare exceedingly contracted. In conformity to this condition of the\r\n_Bronchi_, the _Pulmonary_ Artery and Vein must likewise, either by\r\nmeans of their _Muscular_ Coats, contract themselves to the same\r\n_Dimensions_, or lye in _Folds_ or _Corrugations_, which is less\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when the Ribs are elevated, and the _Diaphragm_ bears\r\ndownward, the Air rushing into the Lungs, shoots out the _Cartilaginous_\r\nRings, and _divaricates_ the Branches of the _Trachea_, and by them\r\nextends and divaricates the several Divisions of the _Pulmonary_ Artery\r\nand Veins, and thereby lengthens and enlarges their Cavities.\r\n\r\nThis enlargement of their Cavities is very considerable, not only upon\r\nthe score of the addition, which they receive in length thereby, but\r\nalso upon the account of their _Divarication_. For whereas, when the\r\nRibs are depress'd, and the Lungs subside, the Blood-vessels are not\r\nonly contracted, (as I have already observ'd) but their Branches,\r\nwhich are exceeding numerous, approach one another, and lie in\r\n_juxta-position_, by which their Cavities are very much compress'd and\r\nstreighten'd: When the Ribs are elevated, and the Lungs turgid with Air,\r\nnot only the Fibres, by which their Coats in the opposite state were\r\ncontracted, are extended; but those innumerable Vessels, which lying\r\nbefore in lines almost parallel upon one another, compress'd one\r\nanother, making an _acute_ Angle at their Junctures, are divaricated and\r\nseparated from each other, and make an _obtuse_, whereby their Channels\r\nare widened.\r\n\r\nThus a passage is open'd to the Blood, from the _Right_ Ventricle of the\r\nHeart to the _Left_, through the Lungs, to which it could not otherwise\r\npass; and the opposition, which the Blood contain'd in that Ventricle,\r\nmust otherwise necessarily have made to its Constriction, is taken off,\r\nand the _Systole_ thereby facilitated.\r\n\r\nNor is that all. For the _Diastole_ being caus'd (as I shall in the\r\nSequel shew) by the force of the Blood rushing into the Ventricles, this\r\nAmpliation and Extension of the _Pulmonary_ Artery is a sort of _Check_\r\nor _Counterpoise_ to it, and prevents an endeavour towards two contrary\r\nActions at once, which must necessarily frustrate both. For the Heart\r\nbeing a _Springy_, _Compressible_ Body, whose proper Action, which is\r\nContraction, depends on the influx of certain Fluids into its Fibers, or\r\nSubstance; and containing besides a Fluid in its _Ventricles_, or great\r\nCavities, in one of which is the Mouth of this Artery, the action of\r\nthis Vessel must in great measure resemble that of a _Syringe_, whose\r\nextremity is immers'd in Water, the Enlargement or Expansion of the\r\nChanels of the Artery answering the drawing of the _Embolum_, as the\r\nconstrictive motion of the Muscle of the Heart does the pressure of the\r\n_Atmosphere_ upon the _Surface_ of the Water, the one making way for the\r\nfluid, and the other forcing it to follow, where the resistance is\r\nleast. In this Sense we may allow a sort of Attraction to the\r\n_Pulmonary_-Artery, depending wholly upon the Action of the\r\n_Intercostal_ Muscles and _Diaphragm_, which we must therefore confess\r\nto be very serviceable and instrumental in promoting the _Systole_ of\r\nthe Heart.\r\n\r\nBut if the Learned Author be deficient in his Account of the _Systole_;\r\nthat is, if he has not observ'd all the Mechanism and Contrivance of\r\nNature for the Contraction of the Heart; much less sufficiently has he\r\naccounted for the _Diastole_, or Dilatation of it, which he ascribes to\r\na motion of _Restitution_ of the over-strain'd Fibres, which yet he\r\nconfesses are made for _Constriction_ only. 'Tis true, he immediately\r\nafter joins the _Influx_ of the _Blood_ as a concurrent Cause; but from\r\nthe slight notice that he takes of it, 'tis plain, that he did not so\r\nmuch as dream of any great share it had in that Action. His Words are\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _De Corde, Pag. 75._]\r\n\r\n_Quin & (ut obiter hoc moneam) omnis motus contractione perficiatur, &\r\nCordis Fibræ ad constrictionem solum factæ sint, apparet quoque Cordis\r\nmotum _totum_ in _Systole_ positum esse; cumque Fibræ ultra tonum suum\r\nin omni constrictione eius tendantur, idcirco ubi nixus iste absolvitur,\r\nmotu quasi _restitutionis_ Cor iterum relaxatur, & sanguine à Venis\r\n_influente_ rursus distenditur; à _nullo_ enim cordis motu, nisi\r\n_tensionem suam remittente_, & ab _irruente_ sanguine _Diastole_ ejus\r\nlibratis adeo viribus succedit._\r\n\r\nI have transcrib'd the intire Paragraph, because it contains his whole\r\n_Hypothesis_ of the _Diastole_, and all the notice that he takes of it\r\nthrough his whole Work. But how slender soever this may prove, it is the\r\nmost substantial that I have any where met with, except a late one of\r\nMr. _Cowper_, which is properly an Improvement of this, and shall be\r\nconsider'd in the Sequel.\r\n\r\nBut if Contraction be the sole Action of these Fibres (as this Great Man\r\nconfesses it to be) and as indeed it is of all _Muscular_ Fibres, I\r\nwonder how so judicious a Writer came to slip into such an Absurdity, as\r\nto call their Distention (vulgarly but improperly call'd Relaxation) a\r\nMotion of _Restitution_. For from the Nature of those Fibres, and their\r\ndisposition in the Structure of the Heart, the natural State of the\r\nHeart appears manifestly to be _Tonical_, and its Dilatation a State of\r\nViolence; and consequently, the Constriction is the _true_ motion of\r\n_Restitution_, and the State to which it will _spontaneously_ return,\r\nwhen the Force is taken off, which is the work of the _Intercostal_\r\nMuscles and _Diaphragm_.\r\n\r\nThus we are left still to seek for the true Cause of the _Diastole_,\r\nwhich seems to me to be the main and most difficult _Phænomenon_,\r\nrelating to the Heart and the Circulation of the Blood. But in Mr.\r\n_Cowper_'s ingenious _Introduction_ to his _Anatomy of Humane Bodies_, I\r\nfind the Share which Dr. _Lower_ hints the Blood to have in that Action,\r\nfurther prosecuted, and improved into the main Instrument of the\r\nDilatation of the Heart, wherein I agree intirely with him. But as to\r\nthe manner, and reasons of its being so very instrumental, I can't be so\r\nperfectly of his mind.\r\n\r\n_The Heart (_says this accurate Anatomist_) of an Animal bears a great\r\nAnalogy to the Pendulums of those Artificial Automata, Clocks and\r\nWatches, whilst its motion is performed like that of other Muscles, the\r\nBlood doing the Office of a _Pondus_._\r\n\r\nThis Explication, being but a Simile without a distinct application to\r\nParticulars, is beside so very short, that I can at best but give a\r\nconjecture at the meaning; which if I mistake, I shall deserve to be\r\nexcused, and expect to be better inform'd.\r\n\r\nBy the _Bloods_ doing the Office of a _Pondus_, I suppose he means, that\r\nthe Blood contributes in the same manner to the motion of the Heart, as\r\nthe _Weights_ do to that of the _Pendulum_ of a _Clock_. If so, the\r\nBlood, according to him, must be the Instrument of _Constriction_; and\r\n_Dilatation_ must be the _Natural_ State, or _Spontaneous_ Motion, to\r\nwhich it wou'd, when under no violence, return; the contrary of which, I\r\npresume, will appear e're I have done.\r\n\r\nBut if he means, that the _Blood_ in its reflux, by _gravitating_ on the\r\n_Auricles_ and _Ventricles_, dilates and expands 'em, acting therein as\r\na _Counterpoise_ to its contractions as a Muscle, I cou'd wish his\r\nDesign had not bound him up to so narrow a compass, and that he had\r\ngiven us an explication at large of so abstruse and so important a\r\n_Phænomenon_: Because the _Specifick Gravity_ of the Blood seems to me a\r\ncause by no means alone adequate to the effect, which it is here\r\nsuppos'd to produce.\r\n\r\nFor, if the Blood acts only as a _weight_ by meer _gravitation_, then\r\nthat part of it only which descends from the Parts above the Heart can\r\nbe employ'd in that Action. This at the largest computation can't amount\r\nto Five pound weight, and must, according to the computation of\r\n_Borellus_, force a Machine, that is able to overcome a resistance of\r\n135,000_l._ I leave every Man to deduct what he shall upon examination\r\nfind reasonably to be deducted, and yet shall rest secure, that it is\r\nnot to be effected in the least with so small a Weight.\r\n\r\nBut neither does the _Refluent_ Blood gravitate in any such proportion,\r\nas I have here assign'd. For to make a true estimate of its\r\n_Gravitation_, we must consider the Circumstances of the Liquor suppos'd\r\nto gravitate; in which it very much resembles Water inclos'd in a\r\nrecurve Tube, of which, if the length of the two Legs be equal, it may\r\nbe suspended in the Air full of Water, with the Extremities downwards,\r\nwithout losing a drop, although the _Diameter_ of those Legs should be\r\nvery unequal. The Case of the Arteries and Veins is pretty near a\r\nparallel to a Tube, so fill'd and inverted. For, if the Arteries and\r\nVeins be continued Tubes, (as by the Microscope they are made to appear)\r\nthen supposing their contents to have no other determination of motion,\r\nthan their own weight wou'd give them, the contain'd Fluids must be\r\nCounterpoises to each other. For the Veins and Arteries being join'd at\r\nthe smaller Extremities, and the larger of both terminating in the\r\nsame parallel Line, it is impossible, according to the Laws of\r\n_Hydrostaticks_, that the contents of either shou'd overbalance t'other.\r\nHow far then must it fall short of forcing the natural Power and\r\nResistance of so strong a Muscle as the Heart, by meer Gravitation?\r\n\r\nThe Blood indeed has a _Progressive_ Motion through its Vessels, wherein\r\nit differs from Water, in a recurve Tube, in the Experiment\r\nabove-stated. But, if the natural Gravitation of the Blood contributes\r\nnothing to the Dilatation of the Heart, this progressive Motion will not\r\nbe found much more sufficient. For, as this Motion is deriv'd intirely\r\nfrom the Heart's Constriction (as all Accounts hitherto derive it) cou'd\r\nthe Blood be suppos'd to re-act upon it by the Heart, with all the force\r\nfirst impress'd upon it by the Heart, it would be insufficient, unless\r\nwe will suppose the _Force communicated_ to be superiour to the _Power\r\nCommunicant_, which is absurd.\r\n\r\nBut when the just and necessary Deductions for the Impediments, which\r\nthe Blood meets with in its Progress through the Vessels, shall be made,\r\nthe remaining Force will be found so exceeding weak, that to prop the\r\nBlood through the Veins may be a task alone too great for so small a\r\nPower, without charging it with the additional difficulty of forcing the\r\nMuscle of the Heart.\r\n\r\n_Alphonsus Borellus_, after a great deal of solemn pains taken to shew\r\nhis Care and Exactness, and to possess his Reader of the Truth of his\r\nCalculations, casts up the force of the Heart, and the _Muscular_ Coat\r\nof the Arteries, to be together equal to a weight of 3,750_l._ and\r\nallots them a Resistance equal to 180,000_l._ to overcome which is 45 to\r\n1. To make up for a disproportion, by his own confession, incredible to\r\nthose who have not consider'd the Matter as he had done, he flings into\r\nthe Scale the additional _Force of Percussion_, which he leaves\r\n_indefinite_, and thinks sufficient to _force any quiescent finite\r\nResistance whatsoever_.\r\n\r\nBut as this Account and _Hypothesis_ are part of a Posthumous Work (if a\r\nliberty of Conjecture may be allow'd in so uncertain a Matter,) I shou'd\r\nsuspect, that these Papers were left unfinish'd by _Borellus_; or at\r\nleast, that in many places the last Hand was never put to them. For\r\nneither in this Place, nor any other of this Work, does he account for\r\nany more than the _Systole_ of the Heart, and the resistance which is\r\nmade to the progressive motion of the Blood in the Arteries only. This\r\nalone he found to exceed the Power of the Heart so prodigiously, that he\r\nseems to shuffle it off his Hands with a general and precarious\r\nSolution, as a difficulty that he was desirous to be rid of. For, having\r\nascrib'd this _stupendous_ (as he himself calls it) effect to the\r\n_Energy of Percussion_, he takes no care to satisfie his Reader any\r\nfarther about it, or to refer him, or give him the expectation of\r\nSatisfaction any where else; although he has an express Treatise on the\r\n_Force of Percussion_, which was written preparatory to this, and to\r\nwhich he frequently refers in other Places of this Work. But what\r\nconfirms my suspicion, that this part was intended for a farther Revise\r\nby the Author, is, that he has left the Progress of the Blood through\r\nthe Veins, and the _Diastole_ of the Heart, absolutely untouch'd, tho'\r\nthey are Difficulties of a much greater magnitude than this, which he\r\nhas attempted to account so slightly for: For, in these he is excluded\r\nthe benefit of _Percussion_, and has yet a greater resistance to\r\novercome without it. Omissions of this kind are so unusual with this\r\nAuthor, where-ever he knows himself to go upon sure grounds, that it is\r\nto me an Argument, that he doubted the sufficience of his _Percussion_,\r\nand reserv'd these important _Phænomena_ for farther Consideration,\r\nwithout plunging himself into such an Absurdity, as to ascribe to\r\n_Percussion_ any such _Energy_ as to be able (so broken as it returns to\r\nthe Heart) by its re-action to force that Power, from whence only it was\r\nat first deriv'd.\r\n\r\nDr. _Lower_, and Mr. _Cowper_, deliver their Opinions of the Cause of\r\nthe Dilatation of the Heart so very short, and without any Arguments to\r\nsupport them, that by exposing them naked, they seem rather to discourse\r\nof it transiently, as Men oblig'd by the Nature of their Subjects to say\r\nsomething of it, than solicitous to give any full or satisfactory\r\nAccount; and therefore I shall proceed no farther upon them here.\r\n\r\nBut though the _Hypothesis_ of _Borellus_ may, in this Case, be found\r\nprecarious or insufficient (a Misfortune that has befallen him in divers\r\nother Particulars) his _Theory_ holds still good. At least it ought to\r\nbe allow'd, in justice to his great Abilities and Exactness, till some\r\nBody convicts him of some material Error in his Calculations, which has\r\nnot as yet been done by any Body, that I know of.\r\n\r\nSupposing then the force of the Heart, and of the _Muscular_ Coat of the\r\nArteries, as likewise of the resistance, which they must overcome, to be\r\ncomputed with any degree of accuracy, there remains yet such a\r\nprodigious disproportion to be accounted for, as requires some more\r\npowerful Agent, than any yet assign'd, to make up the deficiency.\r\n\r\nWhat assistance the Heart receives from the action of the _Thorax_\r\ntowards the facilitating its Contraction, without which assistance there\r\ncou'd have been no _Systole_, has been already shewn. But neither the\r\n_Intercostal_ Muscles, or _Diaphragm_, which are so instrumental in that\r\npart of its action, can contribute any thing to the _Diastole_; because\r\nthey serve only to enlarge the Cavity of the _Thorax_, and thereby to\r\nopen a passage to the Blood from the Heart, and promote its Constriction.\r\n\r\nWhatever therefore the force is, that dilates the Heart, and is the\r\ncause of the _Diastole_, it must be equal to that of the Heart, the\r\n_Intercostal_ Muscles and _Diaphragm_; to all which it acts as an\r\nAntagonist. I take no notice of the _Serratus Major Anticus_, and other\r\nMuscles; which have an obscure share in the _Elevation_ of the _Costæ_,\r\nbecause as much may reasonably be deducted upon the account of the\r\n_Obliquus externus Abdominis_, and other Muscles; which having their\r\nInsertions on some of the lower _Ribs_ are as instrumental towards the\r\n_Depression_ of them, and so balance the Account. But the chief use of\r\nthese is in violent Respiration: In ordinary Respiration their share is\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nSuch a real Power (which may in the least be suspected of any share in\r\nthis Action) is hard, perhaps impossible to be found in the _Machine_ of\r\nany _Animal_ Body; and yet without some such Antagonist, it is as\r\nimpossible the Circulation of the Blood should be maintain'd. All the\r\nEngines yet discover'd within the Body, conspire towards the\r\n_Constriction_ of the Heart, which is the _State_ of _Quiescence_, to\r\nwhich it naturally tends. Yet we find it alternately in a _State_ of\r\n_Violence_, that is, of _Dilatation_; and this upon necessity, because\r\nupon this _Alternation_ depends all Animal Life.\r\n\r\nSome sufficient Cause External must therefore be found, to produce this\r\ngreat _Phænomenon_; which Cause must be either in the _Air_, or\r\n_Atmosphere_, because we have no constant and immediate Commerce with\r\nany other _Mediums_.\r\n\r\nSome great Physicians observing this, and that depriv'd by whatsoever\r\nmeans of Communication with the _external_ Air, we became instantly\r\nextinct, have imagin'd, that in the Act of Inspiration certain purer\r\nparts of the Air, mixed with the Blood in the Lungs, and was convey'd\r\nwith it to the Heart, where it nourish'd a sort of _Vital Flame_, which\r\nwas the Cause of this reciprocal _Æstus_ of the Heart. Others not quite\r\nso gross, rejecting an _Actual Flame_, have fancied, that these fine\r\nParts of Air mixing with the Blood in the Ventricles of the Heart,\r\nproduc'd an _Effervescence_ which dilated it. But these Fancies have\r\nbeen long since exploded and condemn'd upon ample Conviction; and 'tis a\r\nPoint yet undetermin'd, whether any Air does mix with the Blood at all\r\nin the Lungs, or not.\r\n\r\nBut supposing, that some Air may insinuate it self into the _Pulmonary_\r\nVein, it can no other way dilate the Heart than by an Effervescence in\r\nthe Left Ventricle, which wou'd not dilate the Right. But this Opinion\r\nis contradicted by _Autopsie_, and too laboriously confuted by others,\r\nto be brought upon the Stage again here.\r\n\r\nThere remains therefore only the _gross Body_ of the _Atmosphere_ to be\r\nconsidered, which is undoubtedly the _true Antagonist_ to all those\r\nMuscles, which serve for ordinary Inspiration, and the Constriction of\r\nthe Heart. This will appear more evidently, if we consider not only the\r\nPower, but the Necessity of its Action upon _Animal_ Bodies, as well as\r\nthe want of other sufficient Agents.\r\n\r\nThe Heart is a _Solitary_ Muscle of very great strength, and the\r\n_Intercostal_ Muscles and Diaphragm, which likewise have no\r\n_Antagonists_, are a vast additional Force, which must be balanc'd by\r\nthe contrary Action of some equivalent Power or other. For, tho' the\r\nAction of the _Intercostal_ Muscles be voluntary, that does not exempt\r\nthem from the condition of all other Muscles serving for _voluntary_\r\nmotion, which wou'd be in a State of perpetual Contraction,\r\nnotwithstanding any Influence of the Will, were it not for the Libration\r\nof _Antagonist_ Muscles. This Libration between other Muscles, is\r\nanswer'd by the _Weight_ of the incumbent _Atmosphere_, which presses\r\nupon the _Thorax_ and other parts of the Body. And, as in all other\r\nvoluntary Motions the influence of the Will only gives a prevalence to\r\none of its two Powers before equilibrated, so here it serves to enable\r\nthose Muscles to lift up a weight too ponderous for their strength not\r\nso assisted; and therefore as soon as that assistance is withdrawn, the\r\n_Costæ_ are again depress'd by the meer _Gravitation_ of the\r\n_Atmosphere_, which wou'd otherwise remain elevated through the natural\r\nTendency of those Muscles to Contraction.\r\n\r\nThis is evidently prov'd from the _Torricellian_ Experiments, and those\r\nmade upon Animals in Mr. _Boyle_'s Engine; where, as soon as the Air is\r\nwithdrawn, and the _pressure_ thereby taken off, the Intercostal Muscles\r\nand Diaphragm are contracted, and the Ribs elevated in an instant, and\r\ncan't by any Power of the Will be made to subside, till the Air is again\r\nlet in to bear them forcibly down.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _De Respirationis Organis & Usu._]\r\n\r\nIt were scarce worth while to take notice here of a Mistake of the\r\nLearned Dr. _Willis_, were it not for the great Authority of the Man,\r\nwhich is almost sufficient to keep Error in countenance. The Doctor\r\nhaving observ'd, that the Fibres of the _External_ and _Internal\r\nIntercostal_ Muscles ran in a contrary order, as it were, decussating\r\neach other, takes occasion from thence to fansie, that there was an\r\nopposition in their Office; and that as the _External_ serv'd to raise\r\nup the Ribs, the _Internal_ drew them down again, forgetting at that\r\ntime, That, when a contractile Body is fasten'd at the several ends to\r\nPoints unequally moveable, let the Contraction happen in what part or\r\nmanner soever, the more moveable Point must be drawn towards the less\r\nmoveable: By which Rule, whether _External_ or _Internal Intercostals_\r\nbe contracted, the lower Ribs will be forc'd to approach the upper, that\r\nis, be rais'd up.\r\n\r\nAs in the Elevation of the _Costæ_, the Blood, by the passage that is\r\nopen'd for it, is in a manner solicited into the Lungs; so in the\r\nDepression of them, by the subsidence of the Lungs, and the Contraction\r\nof the Blood-Vessels, both which are consequent thereof, the Blood is\r\nforcibly driven, as it were with an _Embolum_, through the Pulmonary\r\nVein into the Left Ventricle of the Heart. And this, together with the\r\n_general Compression_ of the _Body_ by the _weight_ of the _Atmosphere_,\r\nwhich surrounds and presses upon the whole Surface of it, is that Power\r\nwhich causes the Blood to mount in the Veins, after the force impress'd\r\nupon it by the Heart is broken and spent, and which is sufficient to\r\nforce the Heart from its natural State to Dilatation.\r\n\r\nHe that is able to compute the weight of a Column of Air, equal to the\r\nSurface of the whole Body, will readily grant it a power sufficient for\r\nthe Effects, which are here ascrib'd to it. And when he considers, that\r\nthe Bodies of Animals are compressible Machines, he will find that it\r\nmust of necessity affect them in the manner here laid down. But though\r\nour Bodies be entirely compos'd of _Tubuli_, or Vessels fill'd with\r\nFluids; yet this pressure, how great soever, being equal, cou'd have no\r\neffect upon them, if the superficial Dimensions were not easily\r\nvariable; because being compress'd on all parts with the same degree of\r\nForce, the contain'd Fluids cou'd not any where begin to recede, and\r\nmake way for the rest to follow, but wou'd remain as fix'd and\r\nimmoveable as if they were actually solid. But by the Dilatation of the\r\n_Thorax_, room is made for the Fluids to move, and by the Coarctation of\r\nit, fresh motion is imprest, which is the main Spring whereby the\r\nCirculation is set and kept going.\r\n\r\nThis reciprocal Dilatation and Contraction of the superficial Dimensions\r\nof the Body, seems so necessary to Animal Life, that there is not any\r\nAnimal so imperfect as to want it, at least none to the inward\r\nStructure, of which our Anatomical Discoveries have yet reach'd. For,\r\ntho' most kinds of _Fish_ and _Insects_, want both _moveable_ Ribs and\r\nLungs, and consequently have no dilatable _Thorax_, yet that want is\r\nmade up to 'em by an _Analogous_ Mechanism, answering sufficiently the\r\nNecessities of their Life.\r\n\r\nThose Fishes which have no Lungs, have _Gills_, which do the _Office_ of\r\nLungs, receiving and expelling alternately the Water, whereby the\r\n_Blood-Vessels_ suffer the same alteration of Dimensions, that they do\r\nin the Lungs of more perfect Animals.\r\n\r\nThe Lungs or _Air-Vessels_ of Insects, are yet exceedingly more\r\ndifferent in Structure, Distribution, and Situation from those of\r\nperfect Animals, than those of Fishes are, and yet in their Use and\r\nAction agree perfectly with both; that is, _receiving_ and _expelling_\r\nthe Air, and _varying_ the _Dimensions_ and _Capacities_ of the\r\n_Blood-Vessels_. These having no _Thorax_, or separate Cavity for the\r\nHeart and Air-Vessels, have the latter distributed through the whole\r\nTrunk of their Bodies, by which they communicate with the _External_ Air\r\nthrough several _Spiracula_ or _Vent-holes_, to which are fasten'd so\r\nmany little _Tracheæ_, or Wind-pipes, which thence send their Branches\r\nto all the Muscles and _Viscera_, and seem to accompany the\r\nBlood-Vessels all over the Body, as they do in the Lungs only of perfect\r\nAnimals. By this disposition in every _Inspiration_, the whole Body of\r\nthese little Animals is inflated, and in every _Expiration_ compress'd;\r\nand consequently the Blood-Vessels must suffer a _Vicissitude_ of\r\nExtension and Contraction, and a greater motion must thereby be\r\nimpress'd upon the Fluids contain'd in them, than the Heart, which does\r\nnot in those Creatures appear to be Muscular, seems capable of giving.\r\n\r\nThe only Animal that is exempted from this necessary condition of\r\n_Breathing_, or _receiving_ and _expelling alternately some Fluid_ into\r\nand out of the Body, is a _Fœtus_. But this, while included in the\r\nWomb, has little more than a _vegetative_ Life, and ought scarce to be\r\nreckon'd among the number of _Animals_. For, were it not for that small\r\nshare of _Muscular_ Motion, which it exercises in the Womb, it might\r\nwithout absurdity be accounted for as a Graft upon, or Branch of the\r\nMother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Boyle _of the Elasticity of Air. Pechlinus de Aeris &\r\nAlimenti defectu._]\r\n\r\nConcerning the immediate Matter, and Means of Life, and Nutrition,\r\nAuthors are not agreed, nor is it the business of this place to\r\nreconcile, or decide their Differences, but to account for the Motion of\r\nthe Blood through the Vessels only. In order to this, it will be\r\nnecessary to observe, that the Pulsation of the Heart in a _Fœtus_ is\r\nso very weak and obscure, and the Motion of the Blood so extream slow\r\nand languid, as to be scarce, if at all perceivable, as has been\r\nexperienced in the Dissection of Puppies before Respiration had. To\r\nproduce such a feeble Palpitation, and creeping Motion, no greater force\r\nseems to be required, than may be deriv'd from the Communication between\r\nthe Vessels of the Mother and _Fœtus_ in the _Placenta_. I am not\r\nignorant, that divers very Learned Anatomists (whom the Crowd have\r\nimplicitly follow'd) have absolutely rejected all Communication between\r\nthese Vessels. But, with submission to Great Authorities, I think they\r\nhave acted arbitrarily, and without sufficient Warrant from Reason or\r\nExperiment: For neither are the Arguments which they bring against it\r\nconclusive, nor the Office which they assign to the Umbilical Vessels in\r\nlieu of it, proper, or natural to those Vessels, or the reality of the\r\nFact made out by any substantial Reasons. Those that reject this\r\nCommunication usually do it in favour of one or both of these Opinions,\r\nthat the Arteries of the _Uterus_ do deposite a Nutritive Juice, or a\r\nJuice impregnate _with Air_ in the _Placenta_, which is suck'd in by the\r\n_Umbilical_ Vein, and convey'd to the _Fœtus_, for the necessary Uses\r\nof Nutrition and Life. Now those that patronize either of these\r\nOpinions, lead Nature an unnecessary Dance. For if the _Maternal_ Blood\r\ndoes really contain any such _Nutritious_, or any such necessary _Aerial\r\nParticles_, why shou'd they be separated and extravasated, to be with\r\ndifficulty receiv'd into the _Umbilical_ Vein, and again mixt with the\r\nBlood, when they might more easily have been imparted by the plain\r\nsimple way of Transfusion from the Arteries of the _Mother_ to the Veins\r\nof the _Fœtus_. And, that this is the course which Nature takes in\r\nthis Case, I am perswaded from the easiness and simplicity of the\r\nMethod, which readily performs what might be perhaps in vain expected\r\nfrom the other, and wou'd over and above find them, what they seem to\r\ngrope so blindly about for, a first Mover of the Blood in a _Fœtus_.\r\n\r\nThose that contend for the conveyance of the _Nutricious_ Juice, through\r\nthe _Umbilical_ Vein from the _Placenta_, are forc'd upon two\r\nDifficulties next to Absurdities. For first they are oblig'd to make\r\nthis Vein, which, as all other Veins, seems dedicated to the\r\nRe-conveyance of Blood only, the proper and immediate Chanel, thro'\r\nwhich a very different Liquour is to be carried; and next, to give a\r\nPower of Attraction or Suction to it; because the _Nutricious_ Juice,\r\nwhich it is thus destin'd to carry, is both viscous and stagnant, and\r\nhas neither force to drive, nor subtilty to penetrate, or insinuate it\r\nself into the Capillary Veins; and therefore must be drawn or suck'd as\r\n_Milk_ is from the _Breast_, to which the _Placenta_ and its\r\n_Nutricious_ Juice are by the Favourers of them expresly compar'd. But\r\nif this were the sole use of the _Placenta_, and _Umbilical Vessels_,\r\nwhy were the Umbilical _Arteries_ sent along with the Vein? Their\r\nbusiness is not to bring any thing back to the _Fœtus_, nor can they\r\ncontribute any thing to the benefit of the _Mother_; for the _Uterine_\r\nArteries bring all to the _Placenta_, the Umbilical Vein carries it to\r\nthe _Fœtus_, and the _Uterine_ Veins convey back again the Surcharge\r\nof the _Mother_'s Blood; the Umbilical _Arteries_ only, have nothing to\r\ndo, and are superfluous and impertinent, which is contrary to the\r\nconstant Practice of Nature. Yet if _Autopsie_ did in the least\r\ncountenance this Hypothesis, some Defence might still be made; but we\r\nfind in the Umbilical _Vein_ of a _Fœtus_ nothing but _Florid_ Blood,\r\nsuch as in all probability it received immediately from the _Arteries_\r\nof the _Mother_ without any mixture. And therefore I can't help\r\nconcluding, that this Opinion engages its Favourers in some Absurdity,\r\nwithout Necessity and without Proof.\r\n\r\nThey that from the _Placenta_ supply the Body of the _Fœtus_ with\r\n_Air_, are as much distress'd as t'other; for they are forc'd to beg the\r\nQuestion twice, which, even when granted, will not answer their Ends.\r\nFirst, they suppose, that an intimate mixture or confusion of _Air_ with\r\nthe _Blood_, is necessary for the support of Animal Life, a\r\n_Postulatum_, which perhaps the former part of this Discourse may have\r\nrender'd unnecessary; and next, that the _Fœtus_ is supply'd with\r\n_Air_ from, and its _Blood_ mix'd with it in the _Placenta_.\r\n\r\nBut here again they fetch a Compass without necessity or proof. For if a\r\nmixture of _Air_ were necessary to a _Fœtus_, why should it be\r\nseparated from the _Mother_'s Blood, and not rather both communicated\r\ntogether, since it is so much more easie and commodious? But neither\r\ndoes the _Placenta_ seem to be instructed and provided for the\r\nseparation of _Air_, but of a much _grosser Fluid_, destin'd to some\r\nother use, which _Autopsie_ confirms: Yet, were both these Opinions\r\ntrue, they are however defective, and the Circular Motion of the Blood\r\nunprovided for.\r\n\r\nBy the way of _Transfusion_, this great Phænomenon is naturally\r\naccounted for, and the Ends, for which the other two Hypotheses were\r\ndevis'd, might both be answer'd with more ease. For the _Hysterick_\r\nArteries transmitting their Blood immediately to the _Umbilical_ Vein,\r\nmay very easily transmit such _Nutricious_ Juices or _Aerìal_ Particles,\r\nas are contain'd in the Blood, along with it, without depositing them by\r\nthe way. By this means so much of the Impulse of the Mother's Blood is\r\npreserv'd, as suffices to maintain that languid Circulation which a\r\n_Fœtus_ enjoys. For the Blood being driven through the _Arteries_ of\r\nthe _Uterus_ into the _Umbilical Vein_, is convey'd directly to the\r\n_Sinus_ of the _Porta_, and thence by a short and direct Passage through\r\nthe _Cava_ to the Heart; where passing through the _Foramen Ovale_ to\r\nthe _Left_ Ventricle, and through the _Canalis Arteriosus_ from the\r\n_Right_ and _Pulmonary_ Artery, it is all deliver'd without coming at\r\nthe _Lungs_ to the _Aorta_, and from thence again by the _Umbilical\r\nArteries_ to the _Veins_ of the _Uterus_, making a sort of _Epicycle_ to\r\nthe main Circulation in the Mother.\r\n\r\nAs this Opinion is Favour'd by the Structure and Disposition of the\r\nBlood-Vessels on both Parts, so there is nothing in it difficult to be\r\nconceiv'd, or repugnant to Experience. Late Discoveries have made it\r\nappear, that the Arteries and Veins are continu'd Tubes, and that the\r\nlatter contain nothing but what they receive from the former, and no\r\nReason appears why we shou'd think this Method to be varied in the\r\n_Placenta_. On the other hand, if the Arteries of the _Uterus_ were\r\ncontinued to the Veins of the _same_ part, and those of the _Fœtus_\r\nin like manner, without communicating with each other, their Confluence\r\nin the _Placenta_ seems to be altogether impertinent, and of no use, and\r\nthe _Umbilical_ Arteries and Vein fram'd for no other Service or\r\nPurpose, than to give the Blood room for an idle Sally.\r\n\r\nThus the Reasonableness of this old Opinion may be vindicated, but the\r\nCertainty of it rests upon stronger Proof. Mr. _Cowper_, to whose happy\r\nIndustry we owe the Confirmation of many ancient Discoveries, and the\r\nBenefit of some new ones, has the Honour to re-establish this old, but\r\nlong exploded Truth. For by pouring _Mercury_ into a Branch of the\r\n_Uterine Arterie_ of a _Cow_, that went into one of the _Cotyledones_ of\r\nthe _Uterus_, he fill'd those Branches of the _Umbilical_ Veins, which\r\nwent from that _Cotyledon_ to the _Navel_ of the _Fœtus_; which, with\r\na part of the _Uterus_, he keeps prepared by him.\r\n\r\nIt would be a weak Objection, to alledge, That the Observation and\r\nExperiment being made on the _Uterus_ of a _Cow_, the Inference would\r\nnot hold from thence to a _Woman_, the one being _Glanduliferous_, and\r\nthe other _Placentiferous_; since every one of these _Cotyledones_, or\r\n_Uterine Glandules_, is in all respects a little _Placenta_, and all the\r\ndifference between them is in number, name, and magnitude. Why\r\n_Ruminants_ differ in this Particular from other _Viviparous_ Animals,\r\nis beside the Subject of our present Enquiry. But the great Flux of\r\nBlood, which constantly follows upon drawing the _Placenta_ from Women\r\n(which is frequently so great as to cost them their Lives) is as plain a\r\ndemonstration to Reason of the _Continuity_ of the Vessels, as Mr.\r\n_Cowper_'s Experiments is to the Eye.\r\n\r\nI have heard it objected by very Learned Men, that if there were such a\r\n_Continuity_ of Vessels, and such _Transfusion_ of Blood, the _Fœtus_\r\nmust necessarily perish through loss of Blood, upon the separation of\r\nthe _Placenta_ from the _Uterus_; but that, on the contrary, no visible\r\nFlux of Blood does follow while the _Fœtus_ continues wrapt in the\r\nMembrane, in which Condition it may be kept alive some Hours. To this it\r\nmay be answer'd, that the Circulation in the _Fœtus_, being deriv'd\r\nfrom the Mother, may be suppos'd wholly to cease upon the cutting off\r\nthe Communication between them, till it is again renew'd more forcibly\r\nby _Respiration_. But if we allow the motion already impress'd upon the\r\nBlood to be sufficient to keep it going a little while; yet it must\r\nneeds be so exceeding languid, that the meer resistance of the External\r\nAir must be more than enough to hinder any Efflux of Blood from a\r\n_Fœtus_ before Respiration. How long Life may be preserv'd without an\r\n_actual_ Circulation of the Blood, is a Question not of this place. But\r\nwe have been convinc'd by many and notorious Observations and\r\nExperiments, that Life has been recover'd a long time after all tokens\r\nof Respiration, Circulation, or even Life it self, have disappear'd; so\r\nthat we can't think the first Solution either impossible or improbable.\r\n\r\nI expect to be told, that in the early Days of _Gestation_ in\r\n_Viviparous_ Animals, there is no _Placenta_, or any Adhesion of the\r\n_Umbilical_ Vessels to any part of the _Mother_, and consequently no\r\nsuch _Transfusion_; and that in _Oviparous_ there is no _continuity_, or\r\n_communication_ of Vessels of any kind, during the whole time of\r\n_Incubation_.\r\n\r\nBut these Objections carry neither the Weight nor Difficulty along with\r\nthem, that they may be suppos'd to do; for in those Days there is\r\nneither _Blood_ or _Blood-Vessels_, and consequently there can be no\r\n_Circulation_ of the _Blood_; and the _Embryo_, of what Species soever,\r\nis no more than a _Vegetable_ at that time; nor does the _Fœtus_ of\r\nany _Viviparous_ Creature enjoy any _Circulation_, or shew any signs of\r\nAnimal Life, till after those Vessels, as well as others requisite to\r\nthe Circulation, are compleated.\r\n\r\nIt must be confess'd, that _Oviparous_ Animals are denied the benefit of\r\nthis Communication; but that want is sufficiently compensated by a\r\npeculiar Mechanism, which directly answers the ends of _Respiration_,\r\nand the _pressure_ of the _Atmosphere_ upon the _Fœtus_. There is at\r\nthe _obtuse_ end of an Egg a small Cavity fill'd with Air, which is the\r\nsuccedaneous Instrument to the _Respiratory_ Organs. For as soon as the\r\nContents begin to be warm'd by the _Incubation_ of the Hen, or _any\r\nanalogous_ Heat of _Furnace_ or _Dunghill_, the several Humours of the\r\nEgg require a _fermentative_ motion, and the _Air_ contain'd in the\r\n_Cavity_ or _Vesicle_, at the _obtuse_ end of the Egg, is rarefied, and\r\nthe Vesicle extended and enlarg'd, and consequently the other Contents\r\nare comprest; to which the _fermentative_ motion naturally resists. But\r\nboth Bodies being as well _compressible_ as _dilatable_, and both having\r\nan _expansive_ motion imprest upon them by _Incubation_, the Compression\r\nand Renitency will be mutual, but varied in degree, according as either,\r\nthrough the variation of Circumstances, shall prevail. By this means, an\r\nAlternation of Compression and Dilatation will be produc'd in both,\r\nanswering the _respiratory_ motion, by which a motion will be\r\ncommunicated, which, as soon as the Organs by which it should be\r\nregulated are compleated, will in the Body of the _Pullus_ be _regular_\r\nand _circulatory_.\r\n\r\n_Fabricius_ ab _Aquapendente_, and after him, our Great Dr. _Harvey_,\r\nhave assign'd divers Uses to this Cavity or Air Vesicle, the\r\nExtravagance of which have perhaps deterr'd others from enquiring so\r\nmuch into the Use, as the Importance of it requir'd. But though I can't\r\nagree to that _Perspiration_, _Refrigeration_, and _Respiration_, which\r\nthey make it the Instrument of; yet perhaps the _Air_, that was inclos'd\r\nin that _Cavity_, may through the Augmentation of the Body of the\r\n_Pullus_, and its own _Rarefaction_ (which is at last so great as to\r\noccupy half the Shell) break the _Membrane_, which separated it from the\r\n_Pullus_, and thereby give so much _Respiration_ as to form the\r\n_chirping Voice_, which is often heard before the breaking of the Shell,\r\nand with it give an addition of Strength to enable it to break the\r\nShell. But how it should respire sooner, is to me inconceivable.\r\n\r\nThere are many Problems of great seeming Difficulty, the Solutions of\r\nwhich flow naturally from what has been laid down here: But intending to\r\nprosecute this Subject farther, and to treat of the Impediments of\r\nRespiration, and the Consequences of Respiration obstructed or\r\nintermitted, I shall reserve them for that Opportunity, and content my\r\nself here to attempt the _Harveyan_ Problem only, which has given\r\nabundance of Authors so much perplexity.\r\n\r\nThat incomparable Philosopher enquires, _Why a _Fœtus_, taken out of\r\nthe _Uterus_ with the _Membranes_ intire, shall live in Water some Hours\r\nwithout communication with the _External Air_; whereas if it be taken\r\nout and suffer'd once to breath, it can't afterwards survive a Moment\r\nwithout the benefit of _Respiration_._\r\n\r\nGranting the Fact to be as he has deliver'd it, which yet is not so in\r\nall Cases, the main Difficulty is grounded on a Mistake, which from the\r\nstating of the Question I find this Great Man to have slipt into. For he\r\nthinks, that a _Fœtus_ is sooner suffocated after having once\r\nbreath'd, than if it had not breath'd at all, and that by breathing it\r\nhad contracted something which render'd it more perishable. _Idem tamen\r\nsecundis exutus, (_says he_) si semel _aerem_ intra _Pulmones_\r\nattraxerit, postea ne momentum quidem temporis absque eo durare possit,\r\nsed confestim moriatur._ And presently after, _Siquidem constat,\r\nfœtum, postquam _eum semel_ hauserit, _citius_ suffocari; quam cum ab\r\n_illo prorsus_ accebatur._ The Doctor observing a _Fœtus_ to live\r\nlonger without Respiration, and to dispence better with the want of Air\r\nwhile included in the Membranes intire, than it cou'd afterwards; infers\r\nthence, that the Air does in the first Act of Inspiration impress upon\r\nthe Lungs some quality, which renders it ever after more indispensably\r\nnecessary. But allowing his Observation, I must yet deny his Inference\r\nto be good: For deprive a _Fœtus_ of means of respiring, and then\r\ntake it out of the Membranes, and it shall be as soon suffocated, as if\r\nit had respired before. This proves, that this necessity of intercourse\r\nwith the Air, by way of the Lungs, is not the Offspring, but the Parent\r\nof Respiration, and that, that Learned Man was drawn into a Fallacy of\r\n_Non causa pro causa_.\r\n\r\nThe Reason of this Necessity is the pressure of the External Air upon\r\nthe Surface of the Body, from which it was defended by the Interposition\r\nof the Membranes, and the Humours contain'd, which are not so\r\ncompressible as the Body of the _Fœtus_ it self. So soon therefore as\r\nthe _Fœtus_ is excluded, and expos'd to the immediate contact of the\r\nambient Atmosphere, the Vessels and all the Cavities of the Body must\r\nnecessarily be so compress'd, that the Fluids can't have room for\r\nmotion, and consequently the _Fœtus_ could have no Life, if Nature\r\nhad not contriv'd by the motion of the _Thorax_ to remove and admit that\r\npressure alternately, and thereby to impress a motion on the Fluids,\r\nwhich is the Spring of Life. But this motion of the _Thorax_ being any\r\nway suppress'd, the equal pressure of the Atmosphere on all parts,\r\noccasions a total Cessation of motion, which is Death.\r\n\r\nI shall prosecute this Subject no farther now, nor trouble the Reader\r\nwith any Apology, for dissenting from those Great Men herein named;\r\nbecause, I hope, I have done it with Modesty, and all the Respect due to\r\nso great Authorities, and have assign'd nothing which is not Matter of\r\nFact uncontroverted, or deduc'd from it by plain Mechanical Necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Some Thoughts and Experiments concerning _Vegetation_. By _John\r\n   Woodward_, M. D. of the College of Physicians, and R. S. and\r\n   Professor of Physick in _Gresham College_._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Ancients_ generally intitled the _Earth_ to the Production of the\r\n_Animals_, _Vegetables_, and _other Bodies_ upon and about it; and that\r\nfor that Reason 'twas, that they gave it so frequently the Epithets of\r\n_Parent_ and _Mother_[1]. They were of opinion, that it furnished forth\r\nthe _Matter_ whereof _those Bodies_ consist; and receiv'd it all back\r\nagain at their Dissolution for the Composure of _others_. Even those who\r\nasserted _four Elements_, supposed that the _Earth_ was the _Matter_\r\nthat _constituted_ those Bodies; and that _Water_ and the _rest_, serv'd\r\nonly for the _Conveyance_ and _Distribution_ of that _Matter_, in order\r\nto the _forming_ and _composition_ of them. 'Tis true, _Thales_, a\r\nPhilosopher of the first Rank in those early Ages, has been thought to\r\nhave Sentiments very different from these; but that without just\r\nGrounds, as I think I have sufficiently prov'd in another Paper, which I\r\nam ready to produce.\r\n\r\nBut though _Antiquity_ thus gave its _Vote_ for _Terrestrial Matter_,\r\nseveral of the _Moderns_, and some of very _great Name_ too, both _here_\r\nand _abroad_, have gone quite counter, and given _theirs_ in behalf of\r\n_Water_. The _Dignity_ of the _Persons_ that have espoused it, as well\r\nas their _Numbers_, renders this Doctrine very considerable, and well\r\nworth our enquiring into. The great Restorer of _Philosophy_ in this\r\nlast Age, my Lord _Bacon_, is of Opinion, _That for Nourishment of\r\n_Vegetables_, the Water is almost all in all; and that the Earth doth\r\nbut keep the Plant upright, and save it from over-heat, and\r\nover-cold[2]._ Others there are who are still more express; and assert\r\nWater to be the only Principle or Ingredient of all Natural Things. They\r\nsuppose that, I cannot tell by what Process of Nature, Water is\r\n_transmuted_ into _Stones_, into _Plants_, and in brief, all other\r\nSubstances whatever. _Helmont_,[3] particularly, and his _Followers_,\r\nare very positive in this; and offer some _Experiments_ to render it\r\ncredible. Nay, a very _Extraordinary Person_ of our own _Nation_[4]\r\ntries those _Experiments_ over again; and discovers a great Propensity\r\nto the same Thoughts and Opinion they had; declaring for this\r\n_Transmutation of Water_ into _Plants_ and _other Bodies_, though with\r\ngreat Modesty and Deference, which was his usual manner.\r\n\r\nThe _Experiments_ they insist upon are chiefly _two_; the _first_ is,\r\nthat _Mint_, and several _other_ _Plants_ prosper and thrive very\r\ngreatly in _Water_. The _other_ is this; they take a certain quantity of\r\n_Earth_, and _bake_ it in an _Oven_; then they weigh it, and put it into\r\nan _Earthen Pot_. Having well water'd this _Earth_, they make choice of\r\nsome fit _Plant_, which, being first carefully _weigh'd_, they _set_ in\r\nit. There they let it grow, continuing to _water it_ for some time, till\r\n'tis much advanced in _bigness_: Then they take it up; and though the\r\n_Bulk_ and _Weight_ of the _Plant_ be much greater than when _first\r\nset_, yet upon _baking_ the _Earth_, and _weighing_ it, as at first,\r\nthey find it little or not at all diminished in _weight_; and therefore\r\nconclude, 'tis not the _Earth_ but _Water_, that nourishes and is\r\n_turn'd_ into the Substance of the _Plant_.\r\n\r\nI must confess I cannot see how _this Experiment_ can ever be made with\r\nthe _nicety_ and _justness_ that is requisite, in order to _build_ upon\r\nit so _much_ as _these Gentlemen_ do. 'Tis hard to weigh _Earth_ in that\r\n_quantity_, or _Plants_ of the _size_ of those they mention, with any\r\ngreat _exactness_; or to _bake_ the Earth with that _accuracy_, as to\r\nreduce it _twice_ to just the _same Driness_. But I may wave all this;\r\nfor though the _Experiment_ be never so easily practicable, and all the\r\nAccidents of it exactly as they set forth, yet nothing like what they\r\n_infer_ can possibly be concluded from it; unless _Water_, which they so\r\nplentifully bestow upon the _Plant_ in _this Experiment_, be _pure_,\r\n_homogeneous_, and not charged with any _terrestrial Mixture_; for if it\r\nbe, the Plant after all may owe its _Growth_ and _Encrease_ intirely to\r\n_that_.\r\n\r\nSome _Waters_ are indeed so very _clear_ and _transparent_, that one\r\nwould not easily suspect any _terrestrial Matter_ were latent in them;\r\nbut they may be _highly saturated_ with such _Matter_, though the Eye be\r\nnot presently able to descry or discern it. 'Tis true, _Earth_ is an\r\n_Opake Body_; but it may be so far dissolved, reduced to so extreme\r\nsmall Particles, and these so _diffused_ through the _watry Mass_, as\r\nnot sensibly to impede _Vision_, or render the Water much the less\r\n_diaphanous_. _Silver_ is an _Opake_, and indeed a very _dense Body_;\r\nand yet, if perfectly _dissolved_ in _Spirit_ of _Nitre_, or _Aqua\r\nFortis_, that is _rectified_ and thorowly _fine_, it does not _darken_\r\nthe _Menstruum_, or render it less _pellucid_ than before[5]. And other\r\nInstances there are, that oftentimes _great quantities_ of _Opake\r\nMatter_ are sustain'd in _Fluids_, without considerably striking the\r\n_Eye_, or being perceiv'd by it. So that were there _Water_ any where\r\nfound so _pure_, that the quickest Eye could discover in it no\r\n_terrestrial Intermixture_; that would be far short of a _Proof_, that\r\nin reality there was _none_.\r\n\r\nBut after all, even the _clearest Water_ is very far from being _pure_\r\nand wholly _defecate_, in any part of the World that I can learn. For\r\nours here, I have had an Opportunity of examining it over a good part of\r\n_England_; and cannot say I ever met with any, that, however fresh and\r\nnewly taken out of the Spring, did not exhibit, even to the naked Eye,\r\ngreat numbers of exceeding small terrestrial Particles disseminated\r\nthrough all parts of it. Thicker and crasser Water exhibits them in\r\nstill greater Plenty.\r\n\r\nThese are of two general kinds. The one a vegetable terrestrial Matter,\r\nconsisting of very different Corpuscles; some whereof are proper for the\r\nformation and increment of one sort of Plant, and some of another; as\r\nalso some for the Nourishment of one part of the same Plant, and some of\r\nanother. The other kind of Particles sustain'd in Water are of a Mineral\r\nNature. These likewise are of different sorts. In some Springs we find\r\ncommon Salt, in others _Vitriol_, in others _Alum_, _Nitre_, _Sparr_,\r\n_Ochre_, &c. nay, frequently several of these, or other Minerals, all in\r\nthe same Spring; the Water as it drains and passes thorough the _Strata_\r\nof Stone, Earth, and the like, taking up and bearing along such loose\r\nMineral Corpuscles, as it meets with in the Pores and Interstices of\r\nthose _Strata_, and bringing them on with it quite to the Spring. All\r\nWater whatever is much charg'd with the Vegetable Matter, this being\r\nfine, light, and easily moveable. For the Mineral, the Water of Springs\r\ncontains more of it than that of Rivers, especially when at distance\r\nfrom their Sources; and that of Rivers more than the Water that falls in\r\nRain. This I have learn'd from several Trials, which I must not give\r\nAccount of here; my Drift in this place being only to evince the\r\nExistence of Terrestrial Matter in Water.\r\n\r\nAny one who desires farther Satisfaction in this, may easily obtain it,\r\nif he only put Water into a clear Glass Viol, stopping it close, to keep\r\nDust and other exterior Matter out, and letting it stand, without\r\nstirring it for some Days: He will then find a considerable Quantity of\r\nterrestrial Matter in the Water, however pure and free it might appear\r\nwhen first put into the Viol. He will in a very short time observe, as I\r\nhave frequently done, the Corpuscles that were at first, while the Water\r\nwas agitated and kept in motion, separate, and hardly visible[6], by\r\ndegrees, as the Water permits, by its becoming more still and at rest,\r\nassembling and combining together; by that means forming somewhat larger\r\nand more conspicuous _Moleculæ_. Afterwards he may behold these joining\r\nand fixing each to other, by that means forming large thin Masses,\r\nappearing like _Nubeculæ_, or Clouds in the Water; which grow more thick\r\nand opake, by the continual appulse and accretion of fresh Matter. If\r\nthe said Matter be chiefly of the Vegetable kind, it will be sustain'd\r\nin the Water; and discover at length a green Colour, becoming still more\r\nand more of that Colour, I mean an higher and more saturate Green, as\r\nthe Matter thickens and encreases. That this _Matter_ inclines so much\r\nto that _Colour_, is the less strange, since we see so large a share of\r\nit, when constituting Vegetables wearing the same Colour in them. But if\r\nthere be any considerable quantity of meer Mineral Matter in the Water,\r\nthis, being of a greater specifick Gravity than the Vegetable, as the\r\nParticles of it unite and combine in such Number, till they form a\r\n_Molecula_, the Impetus of whose Gravity surpasses that of the\r\nResistance of the Water, subsides a great deal of it to the _bottom_.\r\nNor does it only fall down it self, but frequently entangling with the\r\n_Vegetable Nubeculæ_, forces them down along with it.\r\n\r\nThe Reason why Bodies, when dissolved and reduced to extreme small\r\nParts, are sustain'd in Liquors that are of less specifick Gravity than\r\nthose Bodies are, hath been pointed at by a late ingenious Member of\r\nthis Society[7]. He is indeed far from having adjusted all the _Momenta_\r\nof this Affair; however it must be admitted, that, in the _dividing_ or\r\n_solution_ of Bodies, their Surfaces do not decrease in the same\r\nProportion that their Bulk does. Now the Gravity of a Body, which is the\r\nCause of its sinking or tendency downwards, is commensurate to its Bulk;\r\nbut the resistance that the Liquor makes, is proportion'd, not to the\r\nBulk, but to the Extent of the Surface of the Body immersed in it.\r\nWhence 'tis plain, a Body may be so far divided, that its Parts may be\r\nsustain'd in a Fluid, whose specifick Gravity is less than that of the\r\nsaid Body. Nay, 'tis Matter of Fact, that they frequently are so; and we\r\ndaily see _Menstrua_ supporting the Parts of _Metals_, and other Bodies,\r\nthat are of six, ten, nay, almost twenty times the specifick Gravity of\r\nthose _Menstrua_. And as the Parts of Bodies when divided, are thus\r\nsupported in a Fluid; so when they occur and unite again, they must sink\r\nof course, and fall to the Bottom.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, 'tis palpable and beyond reasonable Contest, that\r\n_Water_ contains in it a very considerable Quantity of terrestrial\r\nMatter. Now the Question is, to which of these, the Water, or the\r\nEarthly Matter sustain'd in it, Vegetables owe their Growth and Augment:\r\nFor deciding of which, I conceive the following Experiments may afford\r\nsome Light; and I can safely say, they were made with due Care and\r\nExactness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anno_ 1691.\r\n\r\nI chose several _Glass Vials_, that were all, as near as possible, of\r\nthe same shape and bigness. After I had put what Water I thought fit\r\ninto every one of them, and taken an Account of the weight of it, I\r\nstrain'd and ty'd over the Orifice of each Vial, a Piece of Parchment,\r\nhaving an hole in the middle of it, large enough to admit the Stem of\r\nthe Plant I design'd to set in the Vial, without confining or\r\nstreightning it, so as to impede its _Growth_. My Intention in this, was\r\nto prevent the inclosed Water from evaporating, or ascending any other\r\nway than only through the Plant to be set therein. Then I made choice of\r\nseveral Sprigs of Mint, and other Plants, that were, as near as I could\r\npossibly judge, alike fresh, sound, and lively. Having taken the weight\r\nof each, I placed it in a Vial, order'd as above; and as the Plant\r\nimbib'd and drew off the Water, I took care to add more of the same from\r\ntime to time, keeping an Account of the weight of all I added. Each of\r\nthe Glasses were, for better distinction, and the more easie keeping a\r\nRegister of all Circumstances, noted with a different Mark or _Letter_,\r\n_A_, _B_, _C_, _&c._ and all set in a Row in the same Window, in such\r\nmanner that all might partake alike of _Air_, _Light_, and _Sun_. Thus\r\nthey continued from _July_ the Twentieth, to _October_ the Fifth, which\r\nwas just Seventy Seven Days. Then I took them out, weigh'd the Water in\r\neach Vial, and the Plant likewise, adding to its weight that of all the\r\nLeaves that had fallen off during the time it stood thus. And Lastly, I\r\ncomputed how much each Plant had gain'd; and how much Water was spent\r\nupon it. The Particulars are as follow.\r\n\r\n (A.) _Common Spear-Mint_, set in _Spring-Water_. The Planted weighed\r\n when put in, _July_ 20. just 27 Grains; when taken forth, _October_ 5.\r\n 42 Grains: So that in this space of 77 Days, it had gained in weight\r\n 15 Grains.\r\n\r\n The whole Quantity of Water expended, during these 77 Days, amounted to\r\n 2558 Grains. Consequently the weight of the Water taken up, was\r\n 170-8/15 times as much as the Plant had got in weight.\r\n\r\n (B.) _Common Spear-Mint_, _Rain-Water_. The Mint weigh'd, when put in,\r\n Gr. 28¼; when taken out Gr. 45¾, having gain'd in 77 Days Gr.\r\n 17½.\r\n\r\n The Dispendium of the Water Gr. 3004, which was 171-22/35 times as much\r\n as the Plant had received in weight.\r\n\r\n (C.) _Common Spear-Mint_, _Thames-water_. The Plant when put in, Gr.\r\n 28, when taken forth, Gr. 54. So that in 77 Days it had gained Gr. 26.\r\n\r\n The Water expended, amounted to Gr. 2493. which was 95-23/26 times as\r\n much as the additional weight of the Mint.\r\n\r\n (D.) _Common Solanum_, or _Night-shade_: _Spring-water_. The Plant\r\n weigh'd, when put in, Gr. 49; when taken out, 106; having gain'd in 77\r\n Days 57 Gr.\r\n\r\n The Water expended during the said time, was 3708 Gr. which was 65-3/57\r\n times as much as the Augment of the Plant.\r\n\r\n _This Specimen_ had several _Buds_ upon it, when first set in the\r\n Water. _These_ in some Days became fair _Flowers_, which were at length\r\n succeeded by _Berries_.\r\n\r\n (E.) _Lathyris seu Cataputia Gerh._ _Spring-Water._ It weigh'd, when\r\n put in, Gr. 98. when taken forth, Gr. 101½. The additional weight\r\n for the whole 77 Days, being but Gr. 3½.\r\n\r\n The Quantity of Water spent upon it during that time, Gr. 2501. which\r\n is 714-4/7 times as much as the Plant was augmented.\r\n\r\n  _Several _other Plants_ were try'd, that did _not thrive_ in _Water_,\r\n  or succeed any better than the _Cataputia_ foregoing:_ _But 'tis\r\n  besides my purpose to give a particular _Account_ of them here._\r\n\r\n(F, G.) _These Two Vials_ were fill'd, the former (F) with _Rain_, the\r\nother with _Spring-water_, at the same time as those above-mention'd\r\nwere; and stood as long as they did. But they had neither of them any\r\nPlant; my Design in these being only to inform my self, whether any\r\nWater exhaled out of the Glasses, otherwise than _thorow_ the Bodies of\r\nthe Plants. The Orifices of these two Glasses were cover'd with\r\nParchment; each piece of it being perforated with an hole of the same\r\nbigness with those of the Vials above. In this I suspended a bit of\r\nStick, about the thickness of the Stem of one of the aforesaid Plants,\r\nbut not reaching down to the Surface of the included Water. I put them\r\nin thus, that the Water in these might not have more Scope to evaporate\r\nthan that in the other Vials. Thus they stood the whole 77 Days in the\r\nsame Window with the rest; when, upon Examination, I found none of the\r\nWater in these wasted or gone off. Tho' I observed both in these, and\r\nthe rest, especially after hot Weather, small Drops of Water, not unlike\r\nDew, adhering to the Insides of the Glasses, that Part of them, I mean,\r\nthat was above the Surface of the enclosed Water.\r\n\r\nThe Water in these two Glasses that had no Plants in them, at the end of\r\nthe Experiment, exhibited a larger Quantity of Terrestrial Matter than\r\nthat in any of those that had the Plants in them did. The Sediment at\r\nthe bottom of the Vials was greater; and the _Nubeculæ_, diffus'd\r\nthrough the Body of the Water, thicker. And of that which was in the\r\nothers, some of it proceeded from certain small Leaves that had fallen\r\nfrom that part of the Stems of the Plants that was within the Water,\r\nwherein they rotted and dissolved. The Terrestrial Matter in the\r\nRain-water was finer than that in the Spring-water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anno 1692._\r\n\r\nThe Glasses made use of in this, were of the same sort with those in the\r\nformer Experiment; and cover'd over with Parchment in like manner. The\r\nPlants here were all _Spear-Mint_; the most kindly, fresh, sprightly\r\nShoots I could chuse. The Water, and the Plants were weigh'd as above;\r\nand the Vials set in a Line, in a South Window: where they stood from\r\n_June_ the 2d to _July_ 28. which was just 56 Days.\r\n\r\n (H.) _Hyde-Park Conduit Water_, alone. The _Mint_ weighed, when put in,\r\n 127 Gr. when taken out, 255 Gr. The whole Quantity of Water expended\r\n upon this Plant, amounted to 14190 Gr.\r\n\r\n This was all along a very kindly Plant; and had run up to above two\r\n Foot in height. It had shot but one considerable collateral Branch; but\r\n had sent forth many and long Roots, from which sprung very numerous,\r\n though small and short, lesser Fibres. These lesser Roots came out of\r\n the larger on two opposite sides, for the most part; so that each Root,\r\n with its _Fibrillæ_, appear'd not unlike a small Feather. To these\r\n _Fibrillæ_ adher'd pretty must Terrestrial Matter. In the Water, which\r\n was at last thick and turbid, was a green Substance, resembling a fine\r\n thin _Conserva_.\r\n\r\n (I.) The _same Water_, alone. The _Mint_ weigh'd, when put in, 110 Gr.\r\n when taken out, 249. Water expended, 13140 Gr.\r\n\r\n This Plant was as kindly as the former, but had shot no collateral\r\n Branches. Its Roots, the Water, and the green Substance, all much as in\r\n the former.\r\n\r\n (K.) _Hyde-Park Conduit-water_, in which was dissolved an Ounce and\r\n half of _Common Garden-earth_. The _Mint_ weigh'd, when put in, 76 Gr.\r\n when taken out, 244 Gr. Water expended, Gr. 10731.\r\n\r\n This Plant, though it had the Misfortune to be annoy'd with many small\r\n Insects that hapn'd to fix upon it; yet had shot very considerable\r\n collateral Branches; and at least as many Roots as either that in H or\r\n I; which had a much greater Quantity of Terrestrial Matter adhering to\r\n the Extremities of them. The same green Substance here, that was in the\r\n two preceding.\r\n\r\n (L.) _Hyde-Park Water_, with the same Quantity of _Garden-mould_ as in\r\n the former. The _Mint_ weigh'd, when put in, 92 Gr. when taken out, 376\r\n Gr. The Water expended 14950 Gr.\r\n\r\n This Plant was far more flourishing than any of the precedent; had\r\n several very considerable collateral Branches, and very numerous Roots,\r\n to which Terrestrial Matter adhered very copiously.\r\n\r\n The Earth in both these Glasses was very sensibly and considerably\r\n wasted, and less than when first put in. The same sort of green\r\n Substance here as in those above.\r\n\r\n (M.) _Hyde-Park Water_, distilled off with a gentle Still. The _Mint_\r\n weigh'd, when put in, 114 Gr. when taken out 155. The Water expended,\r\n 8803 Gr.\r\n\r\n This Plant was pretty kindly; had two small collateral Branches, and\r\n several Roots, though not so many as that in H or I, but as much\r\n Terrestrial Matter adhering to them as those had. The Water was pretty\r\n thick; having very numerous small Terrestrial Particles swimming in it,\r\n and some Sediment at the bottom of the Glass. This Glass had none of\r\n the green Matter above mentioned, in it.\r\n\r\n (N.) The Residue of the Water, which remain'd in the _Still_ after that\r\n in M, was distill'd off. It was very turbid, and as high-colour'd\r\n (reddish) as ordinary Beer. The _Mint_ weigh'd, when put in, 81 Gr.\r\n when taken out, 175 Gr. Water expended, 4344 Gr. This Plant was very\r\n lively; and had sent out six collateral Branches, and several Roots.\r\n\r\n(O.) _Hyde-Park Conduit-water_, in which was dissolved a Drachm of\r\nNitre. The Mint set in this suddenly began to wither and decay; and died\r\nin a few Days: As likewise did two more Sprigs, that were set in it,\r\nsuccessively. In another Glass I dissolv'd an Ounce of good\r\nGarden-mould, and a Drachm of Nitre, and in a third, half an Ounce of\r\nWood ashes, and a Drachm of Nitre; but the Plants in these succeeded no\r\nbetter than in the former. In other Glasses I dissolved several other\r\nsorts of Earths, Clays, Marles, and variety of Manures, _&c._ I set Mint\r\nin distill'd Mint-water; and other Experiments I made, of several kinds,\r\nin order to get Light and Information, what hastened or retarded,\r\npromoted or impeded Vegetation; but these do not belong to the Head I am\r\nnow upon.\r\n\r\n(P.) _Hyde-Park Conduit-water._ In this I fix'd a Glass-Tube about ten\r\nInches long, the Bore about one sixth of an Inch in Diameter, fill'd\r\nwith very fine and white Sand, which I kept from falling down out of the\r\nTube into the Vial, by tying a thin piece of Silk over that end of the\r\nTube that was downwards. Upon Immersion of the lower end of it into the\r\nWater, this by little and little ascended quite to the upper Orifice of\r\nthe Tube. And yet, in all the fifty six Days which it stood thus, a very\r\ninconsiderable Quantity of Water had gone off, _viz._ scarce twenty\r\nGrains; though the Sand continued moist up to the top till the very\r\nlast. The Water had imparted a green Tincture to the Sand, quite to the\r\nvery top of the Tube. And, in the Vial, it had precipitated a greenish\r\nSediment, mix'd with black. To the bottom and sides of the Tube, as far\r\nas 'twas immers'd in the Water, adher'd pretty much of the green\r\nSubstance describ'd above. Other like Tubes I fill'd with Cotton, Lint,\r\nPith of Elder, and several other porous Vegetable Substances; setting\r\nsome of them in clear Water; others in Water tinged with Saffron,\r\nCochinele, _&c._ And several other Trials were made, in order to give a\r\nmechanical Representation of the motion and distribution of the Juices\r\nin Plants; and of some other _Phænomena_ observable in Vegetation, which\r\nI shall not give the Particulars of here, as being not of use to my\r\npresent design.\r\n\r\n(Q, R, S, _&c._) Several Plants set in Vials, ordered in like manner as\r\nthose above, in _October_, and the following colder Months. These throve\r\nnot near so much; nor did the Water ascend in nigh the quantity it did\r\nin the better Seasons, in which the before recited Trials were made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Reflections upon the foregoing Experiments._\r\n\r\n1. _In Plants of the same kind, the less they are in Bulk, the smaller\r\nthe Quantity of the fluid Mass, in which they are set, is drawn off; the\r\nDispendium of it, where the Mass is of equal thickness, being pretty\r\nnearly proportion'd to the Bulk, of the Plant._ Thus that in the Glass\r\nmark'd A, which weigh'd only 27 Grains, drew off but 2558 Grains of the\r\nFluid; and that in B, which weigh'd only 28¼, took up but 3004\r\nGrains; whereas that in H, which weigh'd 127 Grains, spent 14190 Grains\r\nof the Liquid Mass.\r\n\r\nThe Water seems to ascend up the _Vessels_ of Plants, in much the same\r\nmanner as up a Filtre; and 'tis no great wonder that a larger Filtre\r\nshould draw off more Water than a lesser; or that a Plant that has more\r\nand larger Vessels, should take up a greater share of the Fluid in which\r\nit is set, than one that has fewer and smaller ones can. Nor do I note\r\nthis as a thing very considerable in it self, but chiefly in regard to\r\nwhat I am about to offer beneath; and that it may be seen that, in my\r\nother Collations of Things, I made due Allowance for this Difference.\r\n\r\n2. _The much greatest part of the fluid Mass, that is thus drawn off and\r\nconvey'd into the Plants, does not settle or abide there; but passes\r\nthrough the pores of them, and exhales up into the Atmosphere._ That the\r\nWater in these Experiments ascended only through the Vessel of the\r\nPlants, is certain. The _Glasses_ F and G, that had no Plants in them,\r\nthough disposed of in like manner as the rest, remain'd at the End of\r\nthe Experiment, as at first; and none of the Water was gone off. And\r\nthat the greatest part of it flies off from the Plant into the\r\nAtmosphere, is as certain. The least Proportion of the Water expended,\r\nwas to the Augment of the Plant, as 46 or 50 to 1. And in some the\r\nweight of the Water drawn off, was 100, 200, nay, in one above 700 times\r\nas much as the Plant had received of Addition.\r\n\r\nThis so continual an Emission and Detachment of Water, in so great\r\nPlenty from the Parts of Plants, affords us a manifest Reason why\r\nCountries that abound with Trees, and the larger Vegetables especially,\r\nshould be very obnoxious to Damps, great Humidity in the Air, and more\r\nfrequent Rains, than others that are more open and free. The great\r\nMoisture in the Air, was a mighty inconvenience and annoyance to those\r\nwho first settled in _America_; which at that time was much overgrown\r\nwith Woods and Groves. But as these were burnt and destroy'd, to make\r\nway for Habitation and Culture of the Earth, the Air mended and clear'd\r\nup apace, changing into a Temper much more dry and serene than before.\r\n\r\nNor does this Humidity go off pure and alone; but usually bears forth\r\nwith it many Parts of the same Nature with those whereof the Plant,\r\nthrough which it passes, consists. The _Crasser_ indeed are not so\r\neasily born up into the Atmosphere; but are usually deposited on the\r\nSurface of the Flowers, Leaves, and other Parts of the Plants: Hence\r\ncomes our Manna's, our Honeys, and other Gummous Exsudations of\r\nVegetables. But the finer and lighter Parts are with greater ease sent\r\nup into the Atmosphere. Thence they are conveyed to our Organs of Smell,\r\nby the Air we draw in Respiration; and are pleasant or offensive,\r\nbeneficent or injurious to us, according to the Nature of the Plants\r\nfrom whence they arise. And since these owe their Rise to the Water,\r\nthat ascends out of the Earth through the Bodies of Plants, we cannot be\r\nfar to seek for the Cause why they are more numerous in the Air, and we\r\nfind a greater quantity of Odors exhaling from Vegetables, in warm,\r\nhumid Seasons, than in any other whatever.\r\n\r\n3. _A great part of the Terrestrial Matter that is mix'd with the Water,\r\nascends up into the Plant as well as the Water._ There was much more\r\nTerrestrial Matter at the end of the Experiment, in the Water of the\r\nGlasses F and G, that had no Plants in them, than in those that had\r\nPlants. The _Garden-mould_ dissolved in the Glasses K and L, was\r\nconsiderably diminished, and carried off. Nay, the Terrestrial and\r\nVegetable Matter was born up in the Tubes fill'd with Sand, Cotton,\r\n_&c._ in that Quantity, as to be evident even to Sense. And the Bodies\r\nin the Cavities of the other Tubes, that had their lower Ends immers'd\r\nin Water, wherein Saffron, Cochinele, _&c._ had been infused, were\r\ntinged with Yellow, Purple, _&c._\r\n\r\nIf I may be permitted to look abroad a while, towards our Shores and\r\nParts within the Verge of the Sea, these will present us with a large\r\nScene of Plants, that, along with the Vegetable, take up into them meer\r\nmineral Matter also in great abundance. Such are our Sea-Purslains, the\r\nseveral sorts of _Alga's_, of Sampires, and other marine Plants. These\r\ncontain common Sea-salt, which is all one with the _Fossil_, in such\r\nplenty, as not only to be plainly distinguish'd on the Palate, but may\r\nbe drawn forth of them in considerable Quantity. Nay, there want not\r\nthose who affirm, there are Plants found that will yield _Nitre_, and\r\nother mineral Salts; of which indeed I am not so far satisfied, that I\r\ncan depend on the Thing, and therefore give this only as an hint for\r\nEnquiry.\r\n\r\nTo go on with the Vegetable Matter, how apt and how much disposed this,\r\nbeing so very fine and light, is to attend Water in all its Motions, and\r\nfollow it into each of its Recesses, is manifest, not only from the\r\nInstances above alledg'd, but many others. Percolate it withal the Care\r\nimaginable: Filter it with never so many Filtrations, yet some\r\nTerrestrial Matter will remain. 'Tis true, the Fluid will be thinner\r\nevery time than other, and more disingaged of the said Matter; but never\r\nwholly free and clear. I have filtred Water thorough several wholly free\r\nand clear Sheets of thick Paper; and, after that, through very close\r\nfine Cloth twelve times doubled. Nay, I have done this over and over;\r\nand yet a considerable quantity of this Matter discover'd it self in the\r\nWater after all. Now if it thus pass Interstices, that are so very small\r\nand fine along with the Water, 'tis the less strange it should attend it\r\nin its passage through the Ducts and Vessels of Plants. 'Tis true,\r\nfiltering and distilling of Water intercepts and makes it quit some of\r\nthe Earthy Matter it was before impregnated withal: But then that which\r\ncontinues with the Water after this, is fine and light; and such\r\nconsequently, as is in a peculiar manner fit for the Growth and\r\nNourishment of Vegetables. And this is the Case of Rain-water. The\r\nQuantity of Terrestrial Matter it bears up into the Atmosphere, is not\r\ngreat. But that which it does bear up, is mainly of that light kind of\r\nVegetable Matter; and that too perfectly dissolved, and reduced to\r\nsingle Corpuscles, all fit to enter the Tubules and Vessels of Plants:\r\nOn which Account 'tis, that this Water is so very fertile and prolifick.\r\n\r\nThe Reason, why in this Proposition, I say, only a great part of the\r\nTerrestrial Matter that is mix'd with the Water, ascends up with it into\r\nthe Plant, is, because all of it cannot. The Mineral Matter is a great\r\ndeal of it, not only gross and ponderous, but scabrous and inflexible;\r\nand so not disposed to enter the Pores of the Roots. And a great many of\r\nthe simple Vegetable Particles by degrees unite, and form some of them\r\nsmall Clods or _Moleculæ_; such as those mention'd in H, K, and L,\r\nsticking to the Extremities of the Roots of those Plants. Others of them\r\nintangle in a looser manner; and form the _Nubeculæ_, and green Bodies,\r\nso commonly observ'd in stagnant Water. These, when thus conjoin'd, are\r\ntoo big to enter the Pores, or ascend up the Vessels of Plants, which\r\nsingly they might have done. They who are conversant in Agriculture,\r\nwill easily subscribe to this. They are well aware that, be their Earth\r\nnever so rich, so good, and so fit for the production of Corn or other\r\nVegetables, little will come of it, unless the Parts of it be separated\r\nand loose. 'Tis on this Account they bestow the Pains they do in Culture\r\nof it, in Digging, Plowing, Harrowing, and Breaking of the Clodded Lumps\r\nof Earth. 'Tis the same way that Sea-salt, Nitre, and other Salts,\r\npromote Vegetation. I am sorry I cannot subscribe to the Opinion of\r\nthose Learned Gentlemen, who imagine Nitre to be essential to Plants;\r\nand that nothing in the Vegetable Kingdom is transacted without it. By\r\nall the Trials I have been able to make, the thing is quite otherwise;\r\nand when contiguous to the Plant, it rather destroys than nourishes it.\r\nBut this Nitre and other Salts certainly do; they loosen the Earth, and\r\nseparate the concreted Parts of it; by that means fitting and disposing\r\nthem to be assumed by the Water, and carried up into the Seed or Plant,\r\nfor its Formation and Augment. There's no Man but must observe, how apt\r\nall sorts of Salts are to be wrought upon by Moisture; how easily they\r\nliquate and run with it; and when these are drawn off, and have deserted\r\nthe Lumps wherewith they were incorporated, those must moulder\r\nimmediately, and fall asunder of Course. The hardest Stone we meet with,\r\nif it happen, as frequently it does, to have any sort of Salt intermix'd\r\nwith the Sand, of which it consists, upon being expos'd to an humid Air,\r\nin a short time dissolves and crumbles all to pieces; and much more will\r\nclodded Earth or Clay, which is not of near so compact and solid a\r\nConstitution as Stone is. The same way likewise is Lime serviceable in\r\nthis Affair. The Husbandmen say of it, that it does not fatten, but only\r\nmellows the Ground: By which they mean, that it does not contain any\r\nthing in it self that is of the same Nature with the Vegetable Mould, or\r\nafford any Matter fit for the Formation of Plants; but meerly softens\r\nand relaxes the Earth; by that means rendering it more capable of\r\nentering the Seeds and Vegetables set in it, in order to their\r\nNourishment, than otherwise it would have been. The Properties of Lime\r\nare well known; and how apt 'tis to be put into Ferment and Commotion by\r\nWater. Nor can such Commotion ever happen when Lime is mix'd with Earth,\r\nhowever hard and clodded that may be, without opening and loosening of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n4. _The Plant is more or less nourish'd and augmented, in Proportion as\r\nthe Water, in which it stands, contains a greater or smaller Quantity of\r\nproper terrestrial Matter in it._ The Truth of this Proportion is so\r\neminently discernable through the whole Process of these Trials, that I\r\nthink no doubt can be made of it. The _Mint_ in the Glass C, was of much\r\nthe same Bulk and Weight with those in A and B. But the Water, in which\r\nthat was, being River-water, which was apparently stored more copiously\r\nwith terrestrial Matter, than the Spring or Rain-water, wherein they\r\nstood, were; it had thriven to almost double the Bulk that either of\r\nthem had, and with a less Expence of Water too. So likewise the Mint in\r\nL, in whose Water was dissolved a small quantity of good Garden-mould,\r\nthough it had the disadvantage[8] to be less, when first set, than\r\neither of the Mints in H or I, whose Water was the very same with this\r\nin L, but had none of that Earth mix'd with it; yet, in a short time the\r\nPlant not only overtook, but much out-strip'd those and at the end of\r\nthe Experiment was very considerably bigger and heavier than either of\r\nthem. In like manner the _Mint_ in N, though less at the beginning than\r\nthat in M, being set in that thick, turbid, feculent Water, that\r\nremained behind, after that wherein M was placed, was still'd off, had\r\nin fine more than double its original weight and bulk; and receiv'd\r\nabove twice the additional Encrease, than that in M, which stood in the\r\nthinner distill'd Water, had done. And, which is not less considerable,\r\nhad not drawn off half the Quantity of Water that that had.\r\n\r\nWhy, in the beginning of this Article, I limit the Proportion of the\r\nAugment of the Plant to the Quantity of proper Terrestrial Matter in the\r\nWater, is, because all, even the Vegetable Matter, to say nothing of the\r\nMineral, is not proper for the Nourishment of every Plant. There may be,\r\nand doubtless are, some Parts in different Species of Plants, that may\r\nbe much alike, and so owe their Supply to the same common Matter; but\r\n'tis plain all cannot. And there are other Parts so differing, that 'tis\r\nno ways credible they should be formed all out of the same sort of\r\nCorpuscles. So far from it, that there want not good Indications, as we\r\nshall see by and by, that every kind of Vegetable requires a peculiar\r\nand specifick Matter for its Formation and Nourishment. Yea, each Part\r\nof the same Vegetable does so; and there are very many and different\r\nIngredients go to the Composition of the same individual Plant. If\r\ntherefore the Soil, wherein any Vegetable or Seed is planted, contains\r\nall or most of these ingredients, and those in due quantity, it will\r\ngrow and thrive there; otherwise 'twill not. If there be not as many\r\nsorts of Corpuscles as are requisite for the Constitution of the main\r\nand more essential Parts of the Plant, 'twill not prosper at all. If\r\nthere be these, and not in sufficient Plenty, 'twill starve, and never\r\narrive to its natural Stature: Or if there be any the less necessary and\r\nessential Corpuscles wanting, there will be some failure in the Plant;\r\n'twill be defective in Taste, in Smell, in Colour, or some other way.\r\nBut though a Tract of Land may happen not to contain Matter proper for\r\nthe Constitution of some one peculiar kind of Plant; yet it may for\r\nseveral others, and those much differing among themselves. The\r\nVegetative Particles are commix'd and blended in the Earth, with all the\r\ndiversity and variety, as well as all the uncertainty, conceivable. I\r\nhave given some intimations of this elsewhere[9], and shall not repeat\r\nthem here, but hope in due time to put them into a much better Light\r\nthan that they there stand in.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to imagine, how one uniform, homogeneous Matter,\r\nhaving its Principles or Original Parts all of the same Substance,\r\nConstitution, Magnitude, Figure, and Gravity, should ever constitute\r\nBodies so egregiously unlike, in all those respects, as Vegetables of\r\ndifferent kinds are; nay, even as the different Parts of the same\r\nVegetable. That one should carry a resinous, another a milky, a third a\r\nyellow, a fourth a red Juice, in its Veins; one afford a fragrant,\r\nanother an offensive Smell; one be sweet to the Taste, another bitter,\r\nacid, acerbe, austere, &c. that one should be nourishing, another\r\npoisonous, one purging, another astringent: In brief, that there should\r\nbe that vast difference in them, in their several Constitutions, Makes,\r\nProperties, and Effects, and yet all arise from the very same sort of\r\nMatter, would be very strange. And, to note by the by, this Argument\r\nmakes equally strong against those, who suppose meer Water the Matter,\r\nout of which all Bodies are form'd.\r\n\r\nThe _Cataputia_ in the Glass E, received but very little Encrease, only\r\nthree Grains and an half all the while it stood, though 2501 Grains of\r\nWater were spent upon it. I will not say the Reason was, because that\r\nWater did not contain in it Matter fit and proper for the Nourishment of\r\nthat peculiar and remarkable Plant. No, it may be the Water was not a\r\nproper _Medium_ for it to grow in; and we know there are very many\r\nPlants that will not thrive in it. Too much of that Liquor, in some\r\nPlants, may probably hurry the Terrestrial Matter thorough their Vessels\r\ntoo fast for them to arrest and lay hold of it. Be that as it will, 'tis\r\nmost certain there are peculiar Soils that suit particular Plants. In\r\n_England_, Cherries are observ'd to succeed best in _Kent_; Apples in\r\n_Herefordshire_; Saffron in _Cambridgeshire_; Wood in two or three of\r\nour _Midland Counties_; and Teazles in _Somersetshire_. This is an\r\nObservation that hath held in all Parts, and indeed in all Ages of the\r\nWorld. The most ancient Writers of Husbandry[10] took notice of it; and\r\nare not wanting in their Rules for making choice of Soils suited to the\r\nNature of each kind of Vegetable they thought valuable, or worth\r\npropagating.\r\n\r\nBut, which is a further Proof of what I am here endeavouring to advance,\r\nthat Soil that is once proper and fit for the Production of some one\r\nsort of Vegetable, does not ever continue to be so. No, in Tract of time\r\nit loses that Property; but sooner in some Lands, and later in others:\r\nThis is what all who are conversant in these things know very well. If\r\nWheat, for Example, be sown upon a Tract of Land that is proper for that\r\nGrain, the first Crop will succeed very well; and perhaps the second,\r\nand the third, as long as the Ground is in Heart, as the Farmers speak;\r\nbut in a few Years 'twill produce no more, if sowed with that Corn: Some\r\nother Grain indeed it may, as Barley. And after this has been sown so\r\noften, that the Land can bring forth no more of the same, it may\r\nafterwards yield good Oats; and, perhaps, Pease after them. At length\r\n'twill become barren; the Vegetative Matter, that at first it abounded\r\nwithal, being educed forth of it by those successive Crops, and most of\r\nit born off. Each sort of Grain takes forth that peculiar Matter that is\r\nproper for its own Nourishment. First, the Wheat draws off those\r\nParticles that suit the Body of that Plant; the rest lying all quiet and\r\nundisturbed the while. And when the Earth has yielded up all them, those\r\nthat are proper for Barley, a different Grain, remain still behind, till\r\nthe successive Crops of that Corn fetch them forth too. And so the Oats\r\nand Pease, in their Turn; till in fine all is carried off, and the Earth\r\nin great measure drain'd of that sort of Matter.\r\n\r\nAfter all which, that very Tract of Land may be brought to produce\r\nanother Series of the same Vegetables; but never till 'tis supplied with\r\na new Fund of Matter, of like sort with that it at first contain'd. This\r\nSupply is made several ways: By the Grounds lying fallow for some time,\r\ntill the Rain has pour'd down a fresh Stock upon it: _Or_, by the\r\nTiller's Care in manuring of it. And for farther Evidence that this\r\nSupply is in reality of like sort, we need only reflect a while upon\r\nthose Manures that are found by constant Experience best to promote\r\nVegetation, and the Fruitfulness of the Earth. These are chiefly either\r\nparts of Vegetables, or of Animals; which indeed either derive their own\r\nNourishment immediately from Vegetable Bodies, or from other Animals\r\nthat do so. In particular, the Blood, Urine, and Excrements of Animals;\r\nShavings of Horns, and of Hoofs; Hair, Wool, Feathers; calcin'd Shells;\r\nLees of Wine, and of Beer; Ashes of all sorts of Vegetable Bodies;\r\nLeaves, Straw, Roots, and Stubble, turn'd into the Earth by Plowing or\r\notherwise to rot and dissolve there: These, I say, are our best Manures;\r\nand, being Vegetable Substances, when refunded back again into the\r\nEarth, serve for the Formation of other like Bodies.\r\n\r\nNot wholly to confine our Thoughts to the Fields, let us look a while\r\ninto our Gardens; where we shall meet with still further Confirmations\r\nof the same thing. The Trees, Shrubs, and Herbs cultivated in these,\r\nafter they have continued in one Station, till they have derived thence\r\nthe greater part of the Matter fit for their Augment, will decay and\r\ndegenerate, unless either fresh Earth, or some fit Manure, be applied\r\nunto them. 'Tis true, they may maintain themselves there for some time,\r\nby sending forth Roots further and further to a great Extent all round,\r\nto fetch in more remote Provision; but at last all will fail; and they\r\nmust either have a fresh Supply brought to them, or they themselves be\r\nremoved and transplanted to some Place better furnished with Matter for\r\ntheir Subsistence. And accordingly _Gardiners_ observe, that Plants that\r\nhave stood a great while in a Place, have longer Roots than usual; part\r\nof which they cut off, when they transplant them to a fresh Soil, as now\r\nnot of any further use to them. All these Instances, to pass over a\r\ngreat many others that might be alledg'd, point forth a particular\r\nTerrestrial Matter, and not Water, for the Subject to which Plants owe\r\ntheir Increase. Were it Water only, there would be no need of Manures;\r\nor of transplanting them from place to place. The Rain falls in all\r\nPlaces alike; in this Field and in that indifferently; in one side of an\r\nOrchard or Garden, as well as another. Nor could there be any Reason,\r\nwhy a Tract of Land should yield Wheat one Year, and not the next; since\r\nthe Rain showers down alike in each. But I am sensible I have carried on\r\nthis Article to too great a length; which yet on so ample and extensive\r\na Subject, 'twas not easie to avoid.\r\n\r\n5. _Vegetables are not form'd of Water; but of a certain peculiar\r\nTerrestrial Matter._ It hath been shewn, that there is a considerable\r\nQuantity of this Matter contain'd both in Rain, Spring, and River-water:\r\nThat the much greatest part of the fluid Mass that ascends up into\r\nPlants, does not settle or abide there, but passes through the Pores of\r\nthem, and _exhales_ up into the Atmosphere; That a great part of the\r\nTerrestrial Matter, mix'd with the Water, passes up into the Plant along\r\nwith it; and that the Plant is more or less augmented in proportion, as\r\nthe Water contains a greater or smaller Quantity of that Matter. From\r\nall which we may very reasonably infer, that _Earth, and not Water, is\r\nthe Matter that constitutes Vegetables_. The Plant in E, drew up into it\r\n2501 Grains of the fluid Mass; and yet had received but Grains 3 and a\r\nhalf of Increase from all that. The Mint in L, though it had at first\r\nthe disadvantage to be much less than that in I; yet being set in Water\r\nwherewith Earth was plentifully mix'd, and _that_ in I, _only in Water_\r\nwithout any such additional Earth, it had vastly outgrown the other,\r\nweighing at last 145 Grains more than that did, and so having gain'd\r\nabout twice as much as that had. In like manner that in K, though 'twas\r\na great deal less when put in than that in I, and also was impair'd and\r\noffended by Insects; yet being planted in Water wherein Earth was\r\ndissolved, whereas the Water in which it stood had none, it not only\r\nover-took, but considerably surpass'd the other; weighing at last 29\r\nGrains more than that in I, and yet had not expended so much Water as\r\nthat, by above 2400 Grains. The Plant in N, tho' at first a great deal\r\nless than that in M; yet being set in the foul crass Water that was left\r\nin the Still, after that, in which M was set, was drawn off, in\r\nConclusion had gain'd in weight above double what that in the finer and\r\nthinner Water had. The Proportion of the Augment of that Plant that\r\nthrove most was, to the fluid Mass spent upon it, but as 1 to 46. In\r\nothers, 'twas but as 1 to 60, 100, 200; nay, in the _Cataputia_, 'twas\r\nbut as 1 to 714. The Mint in B took up 39 Grains of Water a-day, one day\r\nwith another; which was much more than the whole weight of the Plant\r\noriginally; and yet, with all this, it gain'd not one fourth of a Grain\r\na-day in weight. Nay, that in H took up 253 Grains a day of the Fluid:\r\nWhich was near twice as much as its original Weight, it weighing, when\r\nfirst set in the Water, but 127 Grains. And, after all, the daily\r\nEncrease of the Plant was no more than Grains 2-15/56.\r\n\r\n6. _Spring, and Rain-water, contain pretty near an equal Charge of\r\nVegetable Matter_; _River-water more than either of them._ The Plants in\r\nthe Glasses A, B, and C, were at first of much the same size and weight.\r\nAt the End of the Experiment, the Mint in A had gain'd 15 Grains out of\r\n2558 Grains of Spring-water; that in B, Grains 17 and an half, out of\r\n3004 Grains of Rain-water; but that in C had got 26 Grains out of only\r\n2493 Grains of River-water. I do not found this Proposition solely upon\r\nthese Trials; having made some more, which I do not relate here, that\r\nagree well enough with these. So that the Proportions here deliver'd,\r\nwill hold for the main; but a strict and just Comparison is hardly to be\r\nexpected. So far from it, that I make no doubt, but the Water that falls\r\nin Rain, at some times, contains a greater share of Terrestrial Matter\r\nthan that which falls at others. A more powerful and intense Heat must\r\nneeds hurry up a larger quantity of that Matter along with the humid\r\nVapours that form Rain, than one more feeble and remiss ever possibly\r\ncan. The Water of one Spring may flow forth with an higher Charge of\r\nthis Matter, than that of another; this depending partly upon the\r\nquickness of the Ebullition of the Water, and partly upon the Quantity\r\nof that Matter latent in the _Strata_, through which the Fluid passes,\r\nand the greater or less laxity of those _Strata_. For the same Reason,\r\nthe Water of one River may abound with it more than that of another.\r\nNay, the same River, when much agitated, and in commotion, must bear up\r\nmore of it, than when it moves with less rapidity and violence. That\r\nthere is a great Quantity of this Matter in Rivers; and that it\r\ncontributes vastly to the ordinary Fertility of the Earth, we have an\r\nillustrious Instance in the _Nile_, the _Ganges_, and other Rivers that\r\nyearly overflow the neighbouring Plains. Their Banks shew the fairest\r\nand largest Crops of any in the whole World. They are even loaded with\r\nthe multitude of their Productions; and those who have not seen them,\r\nwill hardly be induced to believe the mighty Returns those Tracts make\r\nin comparison of others, that have not the Benefit of like Inundations.\r\n\r\n7. _Water serves only for a Vehicle to the Terrestrial Matter, which\r\nforms Vegetables; and does not it self make any addition unto them._\r\nWhere the proper Terrestrial Matter is wanting, the Plant is not\r\naugmented, though never so much Water ascend into it. The _Cataputia_ in\r\nE, took up more Water than the Mint in C, and yet had grown but very\r\nlittle, having received only three Grains and an half of additional\r\nweight; whereas the other had received no less than twenty six Grains.\r\nThe Mint in I, was planted in the same sort of Water as that in K, was;\r\nonly the latter had Earth dissolved in the Water; and yet that drew off\r\n13140 Grains of the Water, gaining it self no more than 139 Grains in\r\nweight; whereas the other took up but 10731 Grains of the Water, and was\r\naugmented 168 Grains in weight. Consequently that spent 2409 Grains more\r\nof the Water than this in K, did, and yet was not so much encreased in\r\nweight as this by 29 Grains. The Mint in M, stood in the very same kind\r\nof Water as that in N, did. But the Water in M, having much less\r\nTerrestrial Matter in it than that in N had, the Plant bore up 8803\r\nGrains of it, gaining it self only 41 Grains the while; whereas that in\r\nN drew off no more than 4344 Grains, and yet was augmented 94 Grains. So\r\nthat it spent 4459 Grains of Water more than that did; and yet was not\r\nit self so much increased in weight, as that was, by 53 Grains. This is\r\nboth a very fair, and a very conclusive Instance; on which Account 'tis\r\nthat I make oftner use of it. Indeed they are all so; and to add any\r\nthing further on this Head, will not be needful.\r\n\r\n'Tis evident therefore Water is not the Matter that composes Vegetable\r\nBodies. 'Tis only the Agent that conveys that Matter to them; that\r\nintroduces and distributes it to their several Parts for their\r\nNourishment. That Matter is sluggish and unactive, and would lie\r\neternally confin'd to its Beds of Earth, without ever advancing up into\r\nPlants, did not Water, or some like Instrument, fetch it forth and carry\r\nit unto them. That therefore there is that plentiful Provision, and vast\r\nAbundance of it supplied to all Parts of the Earth, is a mark of a\r\nnatural Providence superintending over the Globe we inhabit; and\r\nordaining a due Dispensation of that Fluid, without the Ministry of\r\nwhich the Noble Succession of Bodies we behold, _Animals_, _Vegetables_,\r\nand _Minerals_, would be all at a stand[11]. But to keep to Plants, 'tis\r\nmanifest Water, as well on this, as upon the other Hypothesis, is\r\nabsolutely necessary in the Affair of Vegetation; and it will not\r\nsucceed without it: Which indeed gave occasion to the Opinion, that\r\nWater it self nourished, and was changed into Vegetable Bodies. They\r\nsaw, though these were planted in a Soil never so rich, so happy, so\r\nadvantageous, nothing came of it unless there was Water too in a\r\nconsiderable quantity. And it must be allow'd Vegetables will not come\r\non or prosper where that is wanting: But yet what those Gentlemen\r\ninferr'd thence, was not, we see, well grounded.\r\n\r\nThis Fluid is capacitated for the Office here assign'd it several ways:\r\nBy the Figure of its Parts, which, as appears from many Experiments, is\r\nexactly and mathematically Spherical; their Surfaces being perfectly\r\npolite, and without any the least Inequalities. 'Tis evident, Corpuscles\r\nof such a Figure are easily susceptible of Motion, yea, far above any\r\nothers whatever; and consequently the most capable of moving and\r\nconveying other Matter, that is not so active and voluble. Then the\r\nIntervals of Bodies of that Figure are, with respect to their Bulk, of\r\nall others the largest; and so the most fitted to receive and entertain\r\nforeign Matter in them. Besides, as far as the Trials hitherto made\r\ninform us, the constituent Corpuscles of Water are, each singly\r\nconsider'd, absolutely solid; and do not yield to the greatest External\r\nForce. This secures their Figure against any Alteration; and the\r\nIntervals of the Corpuscles must be always alike. By the latter, 'twill\r\nbe ever disposed to receive Matter into it; and by the former, when once\r\nreceived, to bear it on along with it. Water is further capacitated to\r\nbe a Vehicle to this Matter, by the tenuity and fineness of the\r\nCorpuscles of which it consists. We hardly know any Fluid in all Nature,\r\nexcept Fire, whose constituent Parts are so exceeding subtle and small\r\nas those of Water are. They'll pass Pores and Interstices, that neither\r\nAir nor any other Fluid will. This enables them to enter the finest\r\nTubes and Vessels of Plants, and to introduce the Terrestrial Matter,\r\nconveying it to all Parts of them; whilst each, by means of Organs 'tis\r\nendowed with for the Purpose, intercepts and assumes into it self such\r\nParticles as are suitable to its own Nature, letting the rest pass on\r\nthrough the common Ducts. Nay, we have almost every where Mechanical\r\nInstances of much the same Tenor. 'Tis obvious to every one, how easily\r\nand suddenly Humidity, or the Corpuscles of Water sustained in the Air,\r\npervade and insinuate themselves into Cords, however tightly twisted,\r\ninto Leather, Parchment, Vegetable Bodies, Wood, and the like. This it\r\nis that fits them for _Hygrometers_; and to measure and determine the\r\ndifferent quantities of Moisture in the Air, in different Places and\r\nSeasons. How freely Water passes and carries with it Terrestrial Matter,\r\nthrough Filtres, Colatures, Distillations, _&c._ hath been intimated\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n8. _Water is not capable of performing this Office to Plants, unless\r\nassisted by a due Quantity of Heat; and this must concur, or Vegetation\r\nwill not succeed._ The Plants that were set in the Glasses Q, R, S,\r\n_&c._ in _October_, and the following colder Months, had not near the\r\nquantity of Water sent up into them, or so great an additional Encrease\r\nby much, as those that were set in _June_, _July_, and the hotter. 'Tis\r\nplain Water has no power of moving it self; or rising to the vast height\r\nit does in the more tall and lofty Plants. So far from this, that it\r\ndoes not appear from any Discovery yet made, that even its own Fluidity\r\nconsists in the intestine Motion of its Parts; whatever some, otherwise\r\nvery learned and knowing, Persons may have thought. There is no need of\r\nany thing more, for solving all the _Phænomena_ of Fluidity, than such a\r\nFigure and Disposition of the Parts, as Water has. Corpuscles of that\r\nmake, and that are all absolutely Spherical, must stand so very tickle\r\nand nicely upon each other, as to be susceptible of every Impression;\r\nand though not perpetually in Motion, yet must be ever ready and liable\r\nto be put into it, by any the slightest Force imaginable. It is true,\r\nthe Parts of Fire or Heat are not capable of moving themselves any more\r\nthan those of Water; but they are more subtil, light, and active, than\r\nthose are, and so more easily put into Motion. In fine, 'tis evident and\r\nmatter of Fact, that Heat does operate upon, and move the Water, in\r\norder to its carrying on the Work of Vegetation: But how 'tis agitated\r\nit self, and where the Motion first begins, this is no fit Place to\r\nenquire.\r\n\r\nThat the Concourse of Heat in this Work is really necessary, appears,\r\nnot only from the Experiments before us, but from all Nature; from our\r\nFields and Forests, our Gardens and our Orchards. We see in _Autumn_, as\r\nthe Sun's Power grows gradually less and less, so its Effects on Plants\r\nis remitted, and their Vegetation slackens by little and little. Its\r\nFailure is first discernible in Trees. These are raised highest above\r\nthe Earth; and require a more intense Heat to elevate the Water, charged\r\nwith their Nourishment, to the Tops and Extremities of them. So that for\r\nwant of fresh Support and Nutriment, they shed their Leaves, unless\r\nsecur'd by a very firm and hardy Constitution indeed, as our\r\n_ever-Greens_ are. Next the Shrubs part with theirs; and then the Herbs\r\nand lower Tribes; the Heat being at length not sufficient to supply even\r\nthese, though so near the Earth, the Fund of their Nourishment. As the\r\nHeat returns the succeeding Spring, they all recruit again; and are\r\nfurnish'd with fresh Supplies and Verdure: But first, those which are\r\nlowest and nearest the Earth, Herbs, and they that require a lesser\r\ndegree of Heat to raise the Water with its Earthy Charge into them: Then\r\nthe Shrubs and higher Vegetables in their Turns; and lastly, the Trees.\r\nAs the Heat increases, it grows too powerful, and hurries the Matter\r\nwith too great Rapidity thorough the finer and more tender Plants: These\r\ntherefore go off, and decay; and others that are more hardy and\r\nvigorous, and require a greater share of Heat, succeed in their Order.\r\nBy which Mechanism, provident Nature furnishes us with a very various\r\nand differing Entertainment; and what is best suited to each Season, all\r\nthe Year round.\r\n\r\nAs the Heat of the several Seasons affords us a different Face of\r\nThings; so the several distant Climates shew different Scenes of Nature,\r\nand Productions of the Earth[12]. The Hotter Countries yield ordinarily\r\nthe largest and tallest Trees; and those in too much greater variety\r\nthan the colder ever do. Even those Plants which are common to both,\r\nattain to a much greater Bulk in the Southern than in the Northern\r\nClimes. Nay, there are some Regions so bleak and chill, that they raise\r\nno Vegetables at all to any considerable Size. This we learn from\r\n_Greenland_, from _Iseland_, and other Places of like cold Site and\r\nCondition. In these no Tree ever appears; and the very Shrubs they\r\nafford, are few, little, and low.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the warmer Climates, and such as do furnish forth Trees and\r\nthe larger Vegetables, if there happen a remission or diminution of the\r\nusual Heat, their Productions will be impeded and diminished in\r\nproportion. Our late Colder Summers have given us proof enough of this.\r\nFor though the Heat we have had, was sufficient to raise the Vegetative\r\nMatter into the lower Plants, into our Corns, our Wheat, Barley, Pease\r\nand the like; and we have had plenty of Straw-berries, Ras-berries,\r\nCurrans, Goosberries, and the Fruits of such other Vegetables as are low\r\nand near the Earth: Yea, and a moderate store of Cherries, Mulberries,\r\nPlumbs, Filberts, and some others that grow somewhat at a greater\r\nHeight; yet our Apples, our Pears, Walnuts, and the Productions of the\r\ntaller[13] Trees have been fewer, and those not so kindly, so thoroughly\r\nripen'd, and brought to that Perfection they were in the former more\r\nbenign and their warm Seasons. Nay, even the lower Fruits and Grains\r\nhave had some share in the common Calamity; and fallen short both in\r\nNumber and Goodness of what the hotter and kinder Seasons were wont to\r\nshew us. As to our Grapes, Abricots, Peaches, Nectarens, and Figs, being\r\ntransplanted hither out of hotter Climes, 'tis the less wonder we have\r\nof late had so general a Failure of them.\r\n\r\nNor is it the Sun, or the ordinary emission of the Subterranean Heat\r\nonly, that promotes Vegetation; but any other indifferently, according\r\nto its Power and Degree: This we are taught by our Stoves, hot Beds, and\r\nthe like. All Heat is of like kind; and where-ever is the same Cause,\r\nthere will be constantly the same Effect. There's a Procedure in every\r\npart of Nature, that is perfectly regular and geometrical, if we can but\r\nfind it out; and the further our Searches carry us, the more shall we\r\nhave occasion to admire this, and the better 'twill compensate our\r\nIndustry.\r\n\r\n[1] _Terra Parens._ Γῆη μὴτηρ πάντων. _Terra Matter._\r\n\r\n[2] _Nat.

Halley_._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the constituent Parts of Matter, and how there comes to be so\r\ngreat a diversity in the weight of Bodies, to all appearance equally\r\nsolid and dense, such as are Gold and Glass, (whose specifick Gravities\r\nare nearly as 7 to 1) seems a very hard Question to those that shall\r\nrightly consider it: For from undoubted Experiment, Gravity is in all\r\nBodies proportionable to the Quantity of Matter in each; and there is no\r\nsuch thing as a Propension of some more, others less, towards the\r\nEarth's Center; since the Impediment of the Air being removed, all\r\nBodies descend, be they never so loose or compact in Texture, with equal\r\nVelocity. It follows therefore, That there is 7 times as much Matter in\r\nGold, as in a piece of Glass of the same Magnitude; and consequently,\r\nthat at least six parts of seven in the Bulk of Glass, must be Pore or\r\nVacuity: This some Favourers of the Atomical Philosophy have endeavoured\r\nto solve, by supposing the primary or constituent Atoms of Gold to be\r\nmuch larger than those of other Bodies, and consequently the Pores\r\nfewer; whereas in other Bodies, the great multitude of the interspersed\r\nVacuities does diminish their Weights.\r\n\r\nBeing desirous to examine this Notion of the Magnitude of Atoms of Gold,\r\nI bethought my self of the extreme Ductility of that Metal, which is\r\nseen in the beating of it into Leaf, and above all in the drawing fine\r\nGilt-wire, by means whereof, I believed I might most exactly obtain the\r\ntrue thickness of the Coat of Gold, that appears, even with the\r\nMicroscope, so well to represent Gold it self, that not the least point\r\nof Silver appears through it. In order to this, I inform'd my self among\r\nthe Wire-drawers, what Gold they us'd to their Silver; and they told me,\r\nThat the very best double Gilt Wire was made out of Cylindrick Ingots, 4\r\nInches in Circumference, and 28 Inches long, which weigh 16 Pounds Troy;\r\non these they bestow 4 Ounces of Gold, that is, to every 48 Ounces of\r\nSilver one of Gold; and that two Yards of the super-fine Wire weighs a\r\nGrain. Hence at first sight it appear'd, that the length of 98 Yards is\r\nin weight 49 Grains, and that a single Grain of Gold covers the said 98\r\nYards, and that the 10000th part of a Grain is above ⅓ of an Inch\r\nlong; which yet may be actually divided into 10, and so the 100000th\r\npart of a Grain of Gold be visible without a Microscope. But being\r\ndesirous to compute the thickness of the Skin of Gold, by means of the\r\nspecifick Gravities of the Metals, viz. Silver 10⅓, and Gold 18⅔,\r\nI found the Diameter of such Wire the 1/386 part of an Inch, and its\r\nCircumference the 1/123 part; but the Gold in thickness not to exceed\r\nthe 1/134500 part of an Inch; whence it may be concluded, that the Cube\r\nof the hundredth part of an Inch would contain above 2433000000, (or the\r\nCube of 1345) of such Atoms. And it may likewise be marvelled at, that\r\nGold being stretcht to so great a degree, as is here demonstrated,\r\nshould yet shew it self of so even and united a Texture, as not to let\r\nthe white Colour of the Silver under it appear through any the least\r\nPores; which argues, that even in this exceeding thinness very many of\r\nthose Atoms may still lie one over the other: Which is a Consideration\r\nmay merit the Thoughts of this Honourable Society, as tending to examine\r\nthat renowned Atomical Doctrine, which has of late much obtain'd among\r\nthe Learned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An Account of the several Species of _Infinite Quantity_, and of the\r\n   Proportions they bear one to the other; as it was read before the\r\n   _Royal Society_, by _E. Halley_._\r\n\r\n\r\nThat all Magnitudes infinitely great, or such as exceed any assignable\r\nQuantity, are equal among themselves, though it be vulgarly received for\r\na Maxim, is not yet so common as it is erroneous; and the Reason of the\r\nmistake seems to be, That the Mind of Man, coming to contemplate the\r\nExtensions of what exceeds the bounds of its Capacity, and of which the\r\nvery Idea does include a Negation of Limits; it comes to pass that we\r\nacquiesce generally, and it suffices to say such a Quantity is infinite.\r\n\r\nBut if we come more nearly to examine this Notion, we shall find, that\r\nthere are really besides infinite _Length_ and infinite _Area_, no less\r\nthan three several sorts of infinite Solidity; all of which are\r\n_Quantitates sui generis_, having no more relation or proportion the one\r\nto the other, than a Line to a Plane, or a Plane to a Solid, or a Finite\r\nto an Infinite. But that among themselves, each of those Species of\r\nInfinites are in given Proportions, is what I now intend to make plain,\r\nif possible.\r\n\r\nBut first, infinite Length, or a Line infinitely long, is to be\r\nconsidered either as beginning at a Point, and so infinitely extended\r\none way, or else both ways from the same Point; in which case the one,\r\nwhich is a beginning infinity, is the one half of the whole, which is\r\nthe Summ of the beginning and ceasing Infinity; or, as I may say, of\r\nInfinity, _à parte ante_, and _à parte post_: Which is analogous to\r\nEternity in Time or Duration, in which there is always as much to follow\r\nas is past, from any point or moment of Time: Nor doth the Addition or\r\nSubduction of finite Length or Space of time alter the case either in\r\nInfinity or Eternity, since both the one or the other cannot be any part\r\nof the whole.\r\n\r\nAs to infinite _Surface_ or _Area_, any right Line, infinitely extended\r\nboth ways on an infinite Plane, does divide that infinite Plane into\r\nequal Parts; the one to the right, and the other to the left of the said\r\nLine: But if from any Point in such a Plane, two right Lines be\r\ninfinitely extended, so as to make an Angle, the infinite Area,\r\nintercepted between those infinite right Lines, is to the whole infinite\r\nPlane, as the Arch of a Circle, on the Point of Concourse of those\r\nLines, as a Centre, intercepted between the said Lines, is to the\r\nCircumference of the Circle; or as the Degrees of the Angle to the 360\r\nDegrees of a Circle. For Example, two right Lines meeting at a right\r\nAngle do include, on an infinite Plane, a quarter part of the whole\r\ninfinite Area of such a Plane.\r\n\r\nBut if so be, two parallel infinite Lines be supposed drawn on such an\r\ninfinite Plane, the Area intercepted between them will be likewise\r\ninfinite; but at the same time will be infinitely less, than that Space\r\nwhich is intercepted between two infinite Lines that are inclined,\r\nthough with never so small an Angle; for that in the one Case, the given\r\nfinite distance of the parallel Lines diminishes the Infinity in one\r\nDegree of Dimension; whereas in a Sector, there is Infinity in both\r\nDimensions; and consequently, the Quantities are the one infinitely\r\ngreater than the other, and there is no proportion between them.\r\n\r\nFrom the same Consideration arise the Three several Species of infinite\r\nSpace or Solidity, as has been said; for a Parallelepipede, or a\r\nCylinder, infinitely long, is greater than any finite Magnitude how\r\ngreat soever; and all such Solids, supposed to be formed on given Bases,\r\nare as those Bases, in proportion to one another. But if two of these\r\nthree Dimensions are wanting, as in the Space intercepted between two\r\nparallel Planes infinitely extended, and at a finite distance; or with\r\ninfinite Length and Breadth, with a finite Thickness; All such Solids\r\nshall be as the given finite distances one to another: But these\r\nQuantities, though infinitely greater than the other, are yet infinitely\r\nless than any of those, wherein all the three Dimensions are infinite.\r\nSuch are the Spaces intercepted between two inclined Planes infinitely\r\nextended; the Space intercepted by the Surface of a Cone, or the sides\r\nof a Pyramid likewise infinitely continued, _&c._ of all which\r\nnotwithstanding, the Proportions one to another, and to the τὸ πᾶν, or\r\nvast Abyss of infinite Space (wherein is the _Locus_ of all things that\r\nare or can be; or to the Solid of infinite Length, Breadth, and\r\nThickness, taken all manner of ways) are easily assignable. For the\r\nSpace between two Planes, is to the whole, as the Angle of those Planes\r\nto the 360 Degrees of the Circle. As for Cones and Pyramids, they are as\r\nthe Spherical Surface, intercepted by them, is to the Surface of the\r\nSphere; and therefore Cones are as the versed Sines of half their\r\nAngles, to the Diameter of the Circle: These three sorts of infinite\r\nQuantity are analogous to a Line, Surface and Solid, and after the same\r\nmanner cannot be compared, or have any proportion the one to the other.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are several other Species of infinite Quantity,\r\narising from the Contemplation of Curves, and their Asymptotes; which,\r\nby reason of the difficulty of the Subject, cannot be made so plain to\r\nmost Readers: But what has been already said, may be sufficient to\r\nevince what we undertook to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An Account of Dr. _Robert Hook_'s Invention of the Marine Barometer,\r\n   with its Description and Uses; published by order of the Royal\r\n   Society, by _E. Halley_, R. S. S._\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it was found that the _Torricellian Tube_, commonly call'd the\r\n_Mercurial Barometer_, by the rising and falling of the _Quick-silver_\r\ntherein, doth presage the Changes of the Air, in relation to fair and\r\nfoul Weather; upon several Years Observation of it, it has been proved\r\nand adjusted for that purpose by Dr. _Robert Hook_; and there have been\r\nby him many attempts to improve the Instrument, and render the Minute\r\nDivisions on the Scale thereof more sensible. He also judging that it\r\nmight be of great use at Sea, contrived several ways to make it\r\nserviceable on Board of Ship; one of which he explain'd to the _Royal\r\nSociety_ at their Weekly Meeting in _Gresham College_, _January 2.\r\n1667/8_. Since which time he hath further cultivated the Invention, and\r\nsome Years ago produced before the said _Society_, the Instrument I am\r\nnow to describe, which for its subtilty and usefulness, seemeth to\r\nsurpass all other performances of the like Nature.\r\n\r\n'Till such time as the Author's present Indisposition will give him\r\nleave to bestow freely his Thoughts on this Subject upon the Publick, it\r\nis the Opinion of the Society, that such an Account be given of this\r\nContrivance, as may render it known, and recommend it to the Mariners\r\nuse, for which it was principally intended.\r\n\r\nThe _Mercurial Barometer_ requiring a perpendicular Posture, and the\r\n_Quick-silver_ vibrating therein with great Violence upon any Agitation,\r\nis therefore uncapable of being used at Sea (tho' it hath lately been\r\ncontrived to be made portable), so it remain'd to find out some other\r\nPrinciple, wherein the Position of the Instrument was not so\r\nindispensably necessary: For this, all those that use the Sea are\r\nobliged to the great facility Dr. _Hook_ has always shewn, in applying\r\nPhilosophical Experiments to their proper uses.\r\n\r\nIt is about forty Years since, that the _Thermometers_ of _Robert de\r\nFluctibus_, depending on the Dilatation and Contraction of included Air\r\nby Heat and Cold, have been disused, upon discovery that the Airs\r\npressure is unequal; that inequality mixing it self with the Effects of\r\nthe warmth of the Air in that Instrument. And instead thereof was\r\nsubstituted the seal'd _Thermometer_, including Spirit of Wine (first\r\nbrought into _England_, out of _Italy_, by Sir _Robert Southwell_) as a\r\nproper Standard of the temper of the Air, in relation to Heat and Cold;\r\nthat Ætherial Spirit being of all the known Liquors the most susceptible\r\nof Dilatation and Contraction, especially with a moderate degree of\r\neither Heat or Cold. Now this being allow'd as a Standard, and the other\r\n_Thermometer_ that includes Air, being graduated with the same\r\nDivisions, so as at the time when the Air was included, to agree with\r\nthe Spirit-_Thermometer_ in all the degrees of Heat and Cold, noting at\r\nthe same time the precise height of the _Mercury_ in the common\r\nBarometers: It will readily be understood, that whensoever these two\r\n_Thermometers_ shall agree, the pressure of the Air is the same it was,\r\nwhen the Air was included, and the Instrument graduated: That if in the\r\nAir-_Thermometer_ the Liquor stand higher than the Division marked\r\nthereon, corresponding with that on the Spirit-glass, it is an\r\nindication that there is a greater pressure of the Air at that time,\r\nthan when the Instrument was graduated. And the contrary is to be\r\nconcluded, when the Air-glass stands lower than the Spirit, _viz._ that\r\nthen the Air is so much lighter, and the _Quick silver_, in the ordinary\r\nBarometer lower than at the said time of Graduation.\r\n\r\nAnd the Spaces answering to an Inch of _Mercury_, will be more or less,\r\naccording to the quantity of Air so included, and the smallness of the\r\nGlass Cane, in which the Liquor rises and falls, and may be augmented\r\nalmost in any proportion, under that of the Specifick Gravity of the\r\nLiquor of the _Thermometer_ to _Mercury_. So as to have a Foot or more\r\nfor an Inch of _Mercury_, which is another great convenience.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed by some, that in long keeping this Instrument, the\r\nAir included either finds a means to escape, or deposites some Vapours\r\nmixt with it, or else for some other cause becomes less Elastick,\r\nwhereby, in process of time, it gives the height of the _Mercury_\r\nsomewhat greater than it ought; but this, if it should happen in some of\r\nthem, hinders not the usefulness thereof, for that it may at any time\r\nvery easily be corrected by Experiment, and the rising and falling\r\nthereof are the things chiefly remarkable in it, the just height being\r\nbarely a Curiosity.\r\n\r\nIn these Parts of the World, long Experience has told us, that the\r\nrising of the _Mercury_ forebodes fair Weather after foul, and an\r\nEasterly or Northerly Wind; and that the falling thereof, on the\r\ncontrary, signifies Southerly or Westerly Winds, with Rain, or stormy\r\nWinds, or both; which latter it is of much more consequence to provide\r\nagainst at Sea than at Land; and in a Storm, the _Mercury_ beginning to\r\nrise is a sure sign that it begins to abate, as has been experienced in\r\nhigh Latitudes, both to the Northwards and Southwards of the Æquator.\r\n\r\nThe Form of this Instrument is shown in the Cut, by Tab. 4. Fig. 1.\r\nwherein,\r\n\r\nAB represents the Spirit-_Thermometer_, graduated from 0, or the\r\nfreezing Point, through all the possible degrees of the Heat or Cold of\r\nthe Air, at least in these Climates.\r\n\r\nCD, is the Air-_Thermometer_, graduated after the same manner with the\r\nlike Degrees.\r\n\r\nEF, is a Plate applied to the side of the _Thermometer_ CD, graduated\r\ninto Spaces answering to Inches and parts of an Inch of _Mercury_, in\r\nthe common Barometers.\r\n\r\nG, a Hand standing on the Plate at the height of the _Mercury_ thereon,\r\nas it was when the Instrument was graduated, as suppose here at 29½\r\nInches.\r\n\r\nLM, a Wire on which the Plate EF, slips up and down, parallel to the\r\nCane of the _Thermometer_ CD.\r\n\r\nK, any Point at which the Spirit stands at the time of Observation;\r\nsuppose at 38 on the Spirit-_Thermometer_; Slide the Plate EF till the\r\nHand G stand at 38 on the Air-_Thermometer_, and if the Liquor therein\r\nstand at 38 likewise, then is the pressure of the Air the same as at the\r\ntime of Graduation, _viz._ 29,5; but if it stand higher, as at 30, at I;\r\nthen is the pressure of the Air greater; and the division on the sliding\r\nPlate against the Liquor, shews the present height of the _Mercury_ to\r\nbe twenty nine Inches seven Tenths. And this may suffice as to the\r\nmanner of using it.\r\n\r\nI had one of these Barometers with me in my late Southern Voyage, and it\r\nnever failed to prognostick and give early notice of all the bad Weather\r\nwe had, so that I depended thereon, and made provision accordingly; and\r\nfrom my own Experience I conclude that a more useful Contrivance hath\r\nnot for this long time been offer for the benefit of Navigation.\r\n\r\nThese Instruments are made according to the Direction of Dr. _Hook_, by\r\nMr. _Henry Hunt_, Operator to the Royal Society, who will furnish any\r\nGentlemen with them, and give them Directions how to use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A Discourse concerning the Proportional Heat of the Sun in all\r\n   Latitudes, with the Method of collecting the same; as it was read\r\n   before the Royal Society, in one of their late Meetings. By _E.\r\n   Halley_._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere having lately arisen some Discourse about that part of the Heat of\r\nWeather, simply produced by the Action of the Sun; and I having\r\naffirmed, that if that were considered, as the only Cause of the Heat of\r\nthe Weather, I saw no Reason, but that under the Pole the solstitical\r\nDay ought to be as hot as it is under the Æquinoctial, when the Sun\r\ncomes vertical, or over the Zenith: For this Reason, that for all the 24\r\nHours of that Day under the Pole, the Sun's Beams are inclined to the\r\nHorizon, with an Angle of 23½ Degrees; and under the Æquinoctial,\r\nthough he come vertical, yet he shines no more than 12 Hours, and is\r\nagain 12 Hours absent; and that for 3 Hours 8 Minutes of that 12 Hours,\r\nhe is not so much elevated as under the Pole; so that he is not 9 of the\r\nwhole 24, higher than 'tis there, and is 15 Hours lower. Now the simple\r\nAction of the Sun is, as all other Impulses or Stroaks, more or less\r\nforceable, according to the _Sinus_ of the Angle of Incidence, or to the\r\nPerpendicular let fall on the Plain, whence the vertical Ray (being that\r\nof the greatest Heat,) being put _Radius_, the force of the Sun on the\r\nHorizontal Surface of the Earth will be to that, as the _Sinus_ of the\r\nSun's Altitude at any other time. This being allow'd for true, it will\r\nthen follow, that the time of the continuance of the Sun's shining being\r\ntaken for a _Basis_, and the _Sines_ of the Sun's Altitudes erected\r\nthereon as Perpendiculars, and a Curve drawn through the Extremities of\r\nthose Perpendiculars, the _Area_ comprehended shall be proportionate to\r\nthe Collection of the Heat of all the Beams of the Sun in that space of\r\ntime. Hence it will follow, that under the Pole the Collection of all\r\nthe Heat of a tropical Day, is proportionate to a Rectangle of the\r\n_Sine_ of 23½ _gr._ into 24 Hours, or the Circumference of a Circle;\r\nthat is, the _Sine_ of 23½ _gr._ being nearly 4 Tenths of _Radius_;\r\nas 3/10 into 12 Hours. Or the Polar Heat is equal to that of the Sun\r\ncontaining 12 Hours above the Horizon, at 53 _gr._ height, than which\r\nthe Sun is not 5 Hours more elevated under the Æquinoctial.\r\n\r\nBut that this Matter may the better be understood, I have exemplified it\r\nby a Scheme, (_Tab. 4. Fig. 2_) wherein the _Area ZGHH_, is equal to the\r\n_Area_ of all the _Sines_ of the Sun's Altitude under the Æquinoctial,\r\nerected on the respective Hours from Sun-rise to the Zenith; and\r\nthe _Area ♋HH♋_ is in the same proportion to the Heat of the\r\nsame 6 Hours under the Pole on the Topical Day; and _⨀HHQ_, is\r\nproportional to the collected Heat of 12 Hours, or half a Day under the\r\nPole, which space _⨀HHQ_, is visibly greater than the other _Area\r\nHZGH_, by as much as the _Area HGQ_ is greater than the _Area ZG⨀_;\r\nwhich, that it is so, is visible to sight, by a great excess; and so\r\nmuch in proportion does the Heat of the 24 Hours Sun-shine under the\r\nPole, exceed that of the 12 Hours under the Æquinoctial: Whence,\r\n_Cæteris paribus_, it is reasonable to conclude, that were the Sun\r\nperpetually under the Tropick, the Pole would be at least as warm, as it\r\nis now under the Line it self.\r\n\r\nBut whereas the Nature of Heat is to remain in the Subject, after the\r\nCause that heated is removed, and particularly in the Air; under the\r\nÆquinoctial, the 12 Hours absence of the Sun does very little still the\r\nMotion impressed by the part Action of his Rays, wherein Heat consists,\r\nbefore he arise again: But under the Pole the long absence of the Sun\r\nfor 6 Months, wherein the extremity of Cold does obtain, has so chill'd\r\nthe Air, that it is as it were frozen, and cannot, before the Sun has\r\ngot far towards it, be any way sensible of his presence, his Beams being\r\nobstructed by thick Clouds, and perpetual Fogs and Mists, and by that\r\nAtmosphere of Cold, as the late Honourable Mr. _Boyle_ was pleased to\r\nterm it, proceeding from the everlasting Ice, which in immense\r\nQuantities does chill the Neighbouring Air, and which the too soon\r\nretreat of the Sun leaves unthawed, to encrease again, during the long\r\nWinter that follows this short interval of Summer. But the differing\r\nDegrees of Heat and Cold, in differing Places, depend in great measure\r\nupon the Accidents of the Neighbourhood of high Mountains, whose height\r\nexceedingly chills the Air brought by the Winds over them; and of the\r\nNature of the Soil, which variously retains the Heat, particularly the\r\nSandy, which in _Africa_, _Arabia_, and generally where such Sandy\r\nDesarts are found, do make the Heat of the Summer incredible to those\r\nthat have not felt it.\r\n\r\nIn the prosecution of this first Thought, I have solved the Problem\r\ngenerally, _viz._ to give the proportional Degree of Heat, or the Sum of\r\nall the _Sines_ of the Sun's Altitude, while he is above the Horizon in\r\nany oblique Sphere, by reducing it to the finding of the Curve Surface\r\nof a Cylindrick Hoof, or of a given part thereof.\r\n\r\nNow this Problem is not of that difficulty as appears at first sight,\r\nfor in _Tab. 4. Fig. 3._ let the Cylinder ABCD be cut obliquely with the\r\nEllipse BKDI, and by the Center thereof H, describe the Circle IKLM; I\r\nsay, the Curve Surface IKLB is equal to the Rectangle of IK and BL, or\r\nof HK and 2 BL or BC: And if there be supposed another Circle, as NQPO,\r\ncutting the said Ellipse in the Points P, Q; draw PS, QR, parallel to\r\nthe Cylinders Axe, till they meet with the aforesaid Circle IKLM in the\r\nPoints R, S, and draw the Lines RTS, QVP bisected in T and V. I say\r\nagain, that the Curve Surface RMSQDP is equal to the Rectangle of BL or\r\nMD and RS, or of 2 BL or AD and ST or VP; and the Curve Surface QNPD is\r\nequal to RS × MD----the Arch RMS × SP, or the Arch MS × 2 SP: Or it is\r\nequal to the Surface RMSQDP, substracting the Surface RMSQNP. So\r\nlikewise the Curve Surface QBPO is equal to the Sum of the Surface\r\nRMSQDP, or RS × MD, and of the Surface RLSQOP, or the Arch LS × 2 SP.\r\n\r\nThis is the most easily demonstrated from the Consideration, That the\r\nCylindrick Surface IKLB is to the inscrib'd Spherical Surface IKLE,\r\neither in the whole, or in its Analogous Parts, as the tangent BL is to\r\nthe Arch EL, and from the Demonstrations of _Archimedes de Sphæra &\r\nCylindro, Lib. I. Prop._ XXX, and XXXVII, XXXIIX. which I shall not\r\nrepeat here, but leave the Reader the pleasure of examining it himself;\r\nnor will it be amiss to consult Dr. _Barrow_'s Learned Lectures on that\r\nBook, Publish'd at _London_, _Anno 1684_, _viz._ _Probl._ IX. and the\r\nCorollaries thereof.\r\n\r\nNow to reduce our Case of the Sum of all the _Sines_ of the Sun's\r\nAltitude in a given Declination and Latitude to the aforesaid Problem,\r\nlet us consider (_Tab. 4. Fig. 4._) which is the _Analemma_ projected on\r\nthe Plain of the _Meridian_, Z the Zenith, P the Pole, HH the Horizon,\r\nææ the Æquinoctial, ♋♋, ♑♑ the two Tropicks, ♋1 the _Sine_ of the\r\nMeridian Altitude in ♋; and equal thereto, but perpendicular to the\r\nTropick, erect ♋I, and draw the Line TI intersecting the Horizon in T,\r\nand the Hour Circle of 6, in the Point 4, and 64 shall be equal to 6R,\r\nor to the Sine of the Altitude at 6: And the like for any other Point in\r\nthe Tropick, erecting a Perpendicular thereat, terminated by the Line T\r\nI: Through the Point 4 draw the Line 4, 5, 7 parallel to the Tropick,\r\nand representing a Circle equal thereto; then shall the Tropick ♋♋ in\r\n_Fig. 4._ answer to the Circle NOPQ, in _Fig. 3._ the Circle 457 shall\r\nanswer the Circle IKLM, T4I shall answer to the Elliptick Segment QIBKP,\r\n6R or 64 shall answer to SP, and 5I to BL, and the Arch ♋T, to the Arch\r\nLS, being the semidiurnal Arch in that Latitude and Declination; the\r\n_Sine_ whereof, tho' not expressible in _Fig. 4._ must be conceived as\r\nAnalogous to the Line TS or UP in _Fig. 3._\r\n\r\nThe Relation between these two Figures being well understood, it will\r\nfollow from what precedes, That, _the sum of the _Sines_ of the Meridian\r\nAltitudes of the Sun in the two Tropicks, (and the like for any two\r\nopposite Parallels) being multiplied by the _Sine_ of the semidiurnal\r\nArch, will give an _Area_ Analogous to the Curve Surface RIMSQDP; and\r\nthereto adding in Summer, or substracting in Winter, the Product of the\r\nlength of the semidiurnal Arch, (taken according to _Van Ceulen_'s\r\nNumbers) into the difference of the above-said _Sines_ of the Meridian\r\nAltitude: The sum in one case, and difference in another, shall be as\r\nthe Aggregate of all the _Sines_ of the Sun's Altitude, during his\r\nappearance above the Horizon; and consequently of all his Heat and\r\nAction on the Plain of the Horizon in the proposed Day_. And this may\r\nalso be extended to the parts of the same Day; for if the aforesaid Sum\r\nof the _Sines_ of the Meridian Altitudes, be multiplied by half the Sum\r\nof the _Sines_ of the Sun's Horary distance from Noon, when the Times\r\nare before and after Noon; or by half their difference, when both are on\r\nthe same side of the Meridian; and thereto in Summer, or therefrom in\r\nWinter, be added or substracted the Product of half the Arch answerable\r\nto the proposed interval of Time, into the difference of the _Sines_ of\r\nMeridian Altitudes, the Sum in one case and Difference in the other,\r\nshall be proportional to all the Action of the Sun during that space of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI fore-see it will be Objected, that I take the _Radius_ of my Circle on\r\nwhich I erect my Perpendiculars always the same, whereas the Parallels\r\nof Declination are unequal; but to this I answer, That our said Circular\r\nBases ought not to be Analogous to the Parallels, but to the Times of\r\nRevolution, which are equal in all of them.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be useful to give an Example of the Computation of this\r\nRule, which may seem difficult to some. Let the Solstitical Heat in\r\n♋ and ♑ be required at _London_, _Lat._ 51° 32'.\r\n\r\n 380-2'8 _Co-Lat._\r\n 23 -30  _Decl. ⨀_\r\n ------\r\n 61 -58               _Sinus_ = ,882674\r\n 14 -58               _Sinus_ = ,258257\r\n                                 ------\r\n                      _Summa_  1,140931\r\n                       _Diff._  ,624417\r\n\r\n _Diff.

Cap. V._ of the\r\nLearned Treatise, _De Calculo Centri Gravitatis_, by the Reverend Dr.\r\n_Wallis_, Published _Anno 1670_.\r\n\r\nFrom this Rule there follow several Corollaries worth Note: As I. That\r\nthe Æquinoctial Heat, when the Sun comes Vertical, is as twice the\r\nSquare of _Radius_, which may be proposed as a Standard to compare with,\r\nin all other Cases. II. That under the Æquinoctial, the Heat is as the\r\n_Sine_ of the Sun's Declination. III. That in the Frigid Zones when the\r\nSun sets not, the Heat is as the Circumference of a Circle into the\r\n_Sine_ of the Altitude at 6. And consequently, that in the same Latitude\r\nthese Aggregates of Warmth, are as the _Sines_ of the Sun's\r\nDeclinations; and in the same Declination of _Sol_, they are as the\r\n_Sines_ of the Latitude, and generally they are as the _Sines_ of the\r\nLatitude into the _Sines_ of Declination. IV. That the Æquinoctial Days\r\nHeat is every where as the Co-sine of the Latitude. V. In all places\r\nwhere the Sun sets, the difference between the Summer and Winter Heats,\r\nwhen the Declinations are contrary, is equal to a Circle into the _Sine_\r\nof the Altitude at six in the Summer Parallel, and consequently those\r\ndifferences are as the _Sines_ of Latitude into, or multiplied by the\r\n_Sines_ of Declination. VI. From the Table I have added, it appears,\r\nthat the Tropical Sun under the Æquinoctial, has, of all others, the\r\nleast Force. Under the Pole it is greater than any other Days Heat\r\nwhatsoever, being to that of the Æquinoctial as 5 to 4.\r\n\r\nFrom the Table and these Corollaries may a general _Idea_ be conceived\r\nof the Sum of all the Actions of the Sun in the whole Year, and that\r\npart of the Heat that arises simply from the Presence of the Sun be\r\nbrought to a Geometrical Certainty: And if the like could be performed\r\nfor Cold; which is something else than the bare Absence of the Sun, as\r\nappears by many Instances, we might hope to bring what relates to this\r\npart of _Meteorology_ to a perfect Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _Concerning the Distance of the Fix'd Stars. By the Honourable _Francis\r\n   Roberts_, Esq; S. R. S._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Astronomers, who had no other way of computing the Distances\r\nof the Heavenly Bodies, but by their Parallax to the Semi-diameter of\r\nthe Earth; and being never able to discover any in the fix'd Stars, did\r\nfrom thence rightly enough infer, that their Distance was very great,\r\nand much exceeding that of the Planets, but could go no farther\r\notherwise than by uncertain guess.\r\n\r\nSince the _Pythagorean_ System of the World has been reviv'd by\r\n_Copernicus_, (and now by all Mathematicians accepted for the true one)\r\nthere seem'd Ground to imagine that the Diameter of the Earth's Annual\r\nCourse (which, according to our best Astronomers, is at least 40000\r\ntimes bigger than the Semi-diameter of the Earth) might give a sensible\r\nParallax to the fix'd Stars, though the other could not, and thereby\r\ndetermine their Distance more precisely.\r\n\r\nBut though we have a Foundation to build on so vastly exceeding that of\r\nthe Ancients, there are some Considerations may make us suspect that\r\neven this is not large enough for our purpose.\r\n\r\nMonsieur _Hugens_ (who is very exact in his Astronomical Observations)\r\ntells us, he could never discover any visible Magnitude in the fix'd\r\nStars, though he used Glasses which magnified the apparent Diameter\r\nabove 100 times.\r\n\r\nNow, since in all likelyhood the fix'd Stars are Suns, (perhaps of a\r\ndifferent Magnitude) we may as a reasonable _Medium_ presume they are\r\ngenerally about the bigness of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLet us then (for Example) suppose the Dog-Star to be so. The Distance\r\nfrom us to the Sun being about 100 times the Sun's Diameter (as is\r\ndemonstrable from the Sun's Diameter being 32 Minutes) it is evident,\r\nthat the Angle under which the Dog-Star is seen in Mr. _Hugens_'s\r\nTelescope, must be near the same with the Angle of its Parallax to the\r\nSun's Distance, or Semi-diameter of the Earth's Annual Course; so that\r\nthe Parallax to the whole Diameter, can be but double such a quantity,\r\nas even to Mr. _Hugens_'s nice Observation is altogether insensible.\r\n\r\nThe Distance therefore of the fix'd Stars seems hardly within the reach\r\nof any of our Methods to determine; but from what has been laid down, we\r\nmay draw some Conclusions that will much illustrate the prodigious\r\nvastness of it.\r\n\r\n1. That the Diameter of the Earth's Annual Orb (which contains at least\r\n160 Millions of Miles) is but as a Point in comparison of it; at least\r\nit must be above 6000 times the Distance of the Sun. For if a Star\r\nshould appear thro' the aforesaid Telescope half a Minute broad (which\r\nis a pretty sensible Magnitude) the true apparent Diameter would not\r\nexceed 18 3d Minutes, which is less than the 6000th part of the apparent\r\nDiameter of the Sun, and consequently the Sun's Distance not the 6000th\r\npart of the Distance of the Star.\r\n\r\n2. That could we advance towards the Stars 99 Parts of the whole\r\nDistance, and have only 1/100 Part remaining, the Stars would appear\r\nlittle bigger to us than they do here; for they would shew no otherwise\r\nthan they do through a Telescope, which magnifies an Hundred-fold.\r\n\r\n3. That at least Nine Parts in Ten of the Space between us and the fix'd\r\nStars, can receive no greater Light from the Sun, or any of the Stars,\r\nthan what we have from the Stars in a clear Night.\r\n\r\n4. That Light takes up more time in travelling from the Stars to us,\r\nthan we in making a _West-India_ Voyage (which is ordinarily perform'd\r\nin six Weeks.) That a Sound would not arrive to us from thence in 50000\r\nYears, nor a Cannon-bullet in a much longer time. This is easily\r\ncomputed, by allowing (according to Mr. _Newton_) Ten Minutes for the\r\nJourney of Light from the Sun hither, and that a Sound moves about 1300\r\nFoot in a Second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _The Famous Mr. _Isaac Newton_'s Theory of the _Moon_._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis _Theory_ which hath been long expected by all the true Lovers of\r\n_Astronomy_, was communicated from Mr. _Newton_ to Dr. _Gregory_,\r\n_Astronomy_ Professor at _Oxford_, and by him published in his _Astron.\r\nElem. Philos._ and _Geomet._ p. 336. From whence, as it was lately\r\ntranslated into _English_, I thought fit to insert it here.\r\n\r\nBy this Theory, what by all Astronomers was thought most difficult and\r\nalmost impossible to be done, the Excellent Mr. _Newton_ hath now\r\neffected; _viz._ to determine the Moon's Place even in her Quadratures,\r\nand all other Parts of her Orbit, besides the Syzygys, so accurately by\r\nCalculation, that the Difference between that and her true Place in the\r\nHeavens, shall scarce be above two minutes in her Syzygys, or above\r\nthree in her Quadratures, and is usually so small, that it may well\r\nenough be reckon'd only as a Defect in the Observation. And this Mr.\r\n_Newton_ experienced, by comparing it with very many Places of the Moon,\r\nobserv'd by Mr. _Flamsteed_, and communicated to him.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Observatory at _Greenwich_, is to the West of the Meridian of\r\n_Paris_, 2 degrees, 19 minutes. Of _Uraniburgh_, 12 degrees, 51 minutes,\r\n30 seconds. And of _Gedanum_, 18 degrees, 48 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe mean Motions of the Sun and Moon, accounted from the Vernal Æquinox\r\nat the Meridian of _Greenwich_, I make to be as followeth.\r\n\r\nThe last Day of _December 1680_, at Noon (_Old Stile_) the mean Motion\r\nof the Sun was 9 Signs, 20 degrees, 34 minutes, 46 seconds. Of the Sun's\r\nApogæum, was 3 S. 7 deg. 23 min. 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nThat the mean Motion of the Moon at that time, was 6 S. 1 degree, 45\r\nminutes, 45 seconds. And of her Apogee, 8 S. 4 degrees, 28 minutes, 5\r\nseconds. Of the ascending Node of the Moon's Orbit, 5 S. 24 deg. 14 min.\r\n35 seconds, _&c._\r\n\r\nAnd on the last Day of _December, 1700_, at Noon, the mean Motion of the\r\nSun was 9 S. 20 degrees, 43 minutes, 50 seconds. Of the Sun's Apogee,\r\n3 S. 7 degrees, 44 minutes, 30 seconds. The mean Motion of the Moon was\r\n10 S. 15 degrees, 19 minutes, 50 seconds. Of the Moon's Apogee, 11 S. 8\r\ndegrees, 18 minutes, 20 seconds. And of her ascending Node, 4 S. 27\r\ndegrees, 24 minutes, 20 seconds. For in 20 _Julian_ Years, or 7305 Days,\r\nthe Sun's Motion is 20 Revol. 0 S. 0 degrees, 9 minutes, 4 seconds. And\r\nthe Motion of the Sun's Apogee, 21 minutes, 0 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe Motion of the Moon in the same time, is 267 Revol. 4 S. 13 degrees,\r\n34 minutes, 5 seconds. And the Motion of the Lunar Apogee, is 2 Revol.\r\n3 S. 3 degrees, 50 minutes, 15 seconds. And the Motion of her Node, 1\r\nRevol. 0 S, 26 degrees, 50 minutes, 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nAll which Motions are accounted from the Vernal Æquinox: Wherefore if\r\nfrom them there be subtracted the Recession or Motion of the Æquinoctial\r\nPoint, in _Antecedentia_, during that space, which is 16 minutes, 40\r\nseconds, there will remain the Motions in reference to the fix'd Stars\r\nin 20 _Julian_ Years; _viz._ the Sun's 19 Revol. 11 S. 29 degrees, 52\r\nminutes, 24 seconds. Of his Apogee, 4 minutes, 20 seconds. And the\r\nMoon's 267 Revol. 4 S. 13 degrees, 17 minutes, 25 seconds. Of her\r\nApogee, 2 Revol. 3 S. 3 degrees, 33 minutes, 35 seconds. And of the Node\r\nof the Moon, 1 Revol. 0 S. 27 degrees, 6 minutes, 55 seconds.\r\n\r\nAccording to this Computation, the _Tropical Year_ is 365 Days, 5 Hours,\r\n48 Minutes, 57 Seconds. And the _Sydereal Year_ is 365 Days, 6 Hours, 9\r\nMinutes, 14 Seconds.\r\n\r\nThese mean Motions of the Luminaries are affected with various\r\nInequalities: Of which,\r\n\r\n1. There are the Annual Equations of the aforesaid mean Motions of the\r\nSun and Moon, and of the Apogee and Node of the Moon.\r\n\r\nThe Annual Equation of the mean Motion of the Sun, depends on the\r\nEccentricity of the Earth's Orbit round the Sun, which is 16-11/12 of\r\nsuch Parts, as that the Earth's mean Distance from the Sun shall be\r\n1000: Whence 'tis call'd the _Equation of the Centre_; and is, when\r\ngreatest, 1 degree, 56 minutes, 20 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe greatest Annual Equation of the Moon's mean Motion, is 11 degrees,\r\n49 seconds; of her Apogee, 20 minutes, and of her Node, 9 minutes, 30\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nAnd these four Annual Equations are always mutually proportional one to\r\nanother: Wherefore when any of them is at the greatest, the other three\r\nwill also be greatest; and when any one lessens, the other three will\r\nalso be diminished in the same Ratio.\r\n\r\nThe Annual Equation of the Sun's Centre being given, the three other\r\ncorresponding Annual Equations will be also given; and therefore a Table\r\nof that will serve for all. For if the Annual Equation of the Sun's\r\nCentre be taken from thence, for any Time, and be call'd P, and let\r\n1/10P = Q, Q + 1/60Q = R, 1/6P = D, D + 1/30D = E, and D - 1/50D = 2F;\r\nthen shall the Annual Equation of the Moon's mean Motion for that time\r\nbe R, that of the Apogee of the Moon will be E, and that of the Node F.\r\n\r\nOnly observe here, That if the Equation of the Sun's Centre be required\r\nto be added; then the Equation of the Moon's mean Motion must be\r\nsubtracted, that of her Apogee must be added, and that of the Node\r\nsubducted, And on the contrary, if the Equation of the Sun's Centre were\r\nto be subducted, the Moon's Equation must be added, the Equation of her\r\nApogee subducted, and that of her Node added.\r\n\r\nThere is also an _Equation of the Moon's mean Motion_, depending on the\r\nsituation of her Apogee, in respect of the Sun; which is greatest when\r\nthe Moon's Apogee is in an Octant with the Sun, and is nothing at all\r\nwhen it is in the Quadratures or Syzygys. This Equation, when greatest,\r\nand the Sun in _Perigæo_, is 3 Minutes, 56 Seconds. But if the Sun be in\r\n_Apogæo_, it will never be above 3 Minutes, 34 Seconds. At other\r\nDistances of the Sun from the Earth, this Equation, when greatest, is\r\nreciprocally as the Cube of such Distance. But when the Moon's Apogee is\r\nany where but in the _Octants_, this Equation grows less, and is mostly\r\nat the same distance between the Earth and Sun, as the Sine of the\r\ndouble Distance of the Moon's Apogee, from the next Quadrature or\r\nSyzygy, to the Radius.\r\n\r\nThis is to be added to the Moon's Motion, while her Apogee passes from a\r\nQuadrature with the Sun to a Syzygy; but this is to be subtracted from\r\nit, while the Apogee moves from the Syzygy to the Quadrature.\r\n\r\nThere is moreover another _Equation of the Moon's Motion_, which depends\r\non the Aspect of the Nodes of the Moon's Orbit with the Sun: And this is\r\ngreatest, when her Nodes are in _Octants_ to the Sun, and vanishes\r\nquite, when they come to their Quadratures or Syzygys. This Equation is\r\nproportional to the Sine of the double Distance of the Node from the\r\nnext Syzygy, or Quadrature; and at greatest, is but 47 seconds. This\r\nmust be added to the Moon's mean Motion, while the Nodes are passing\r\nfrom their Syzygys with the Sun, to their Quadratures with him; but\r\nsubtracted while they pass from the Quadratures to the Syzygys.\r\n\r\nFrom the Sun's true Place, take the equated mean Motion of the Lunar\r\nApogee, as was above shew'd, the Remainder will be the Annual Argument\r\nof the said Apogee. From whence the _Eccentricity of the Moon_, and the\r\n_second Equation_ of her Apogee may be computed after the manner of the\r\nfollowing (_which takes place also in the Computation of any other\r\nintermediate Equations_).\r\n\r\nTab. 3. Fig. 6. Let T represent the Earth, TS, a Right Line joining the\r\nEarth and Sun, TACB, a Right Line drawn from the Earth to the middle or\r\nmean Place of the Moon's Apogee, equated, as above: Let the Angle STA be\r\nthe Annual Argument of the aforesaid Apogee, TA the least Eccentricity\r\nof the Moon's Orbit, TB the greatest. Bissect AB in G; and on the Centre\r\nC, with the Distance AC describe a Circle AFB, and make the Angle BCF =\r\nto the double of the Annual Argument. Draw the Right Line TF, that shall\r\nbe the Eccentricity of the Moon's Orbit; and the Angle BTF, is the\r\nsecond Equation of the Moon's Apogee required.\r\n\r\nIn order to whose Determination, let the mean Distance of the Earth from\r\nthe Moon, or the Semi-diameter of the Moon's Orbit, be 100000; then\r\nshall its greatest Eccentricity TB be 66782 such Parts; and the least\r\nTA, 43319. So that the greatest Equation of the Orbit, _viz._ when the\r\nApogee is in the Syzygys, will be 7 degrees, 39 minutes, 30 seconds, or\r\nperhaps 7 degrees, 40 minutes, (for I suspect there will be some\r\nAlteration, according to the Position of the Apogee in _Cancer_ and\r\n_Capricorn_.) But when it is Quadrate to the Sun, the greatest Equation\r\naforesaid will be 4 degrees, 57 minutes, 56 seconds; and the greatest\r\nEquation of the Apogee, 12 degrees, 15 minutes, 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nHaving from these Principles made a Table of the Equation of the Moon's\r\nApogee, and of the Eccentricities of her Orbit to each degree of the\r\nAnnual Argument, from whence the Eccentricity TF, and the Angle BTF\r\n(_viz._ the second and the principal Equation of the Apogee) may easily\r\nbe had for any Time required; let the Equation thus found be added to\r\nthe first Equated Place of the Moon's Apogee, if the Annual Argument be\r\nless than 90 degrees, or greater than 180 degrees, and less than 270;\r\notherwise it must be subducted from it; and the Sum or Difference shall\r\nbe the Place of the Lunar Apogee secondarily equated; which being taken\r\nfrom the Moon's Place equated a third time, shall leave the mean Anomaly\r\nof the Moon corresponding to any given Time. Moreover, from this mean\r\nAnomaly of the Moon, and the before-found Eccentricity of her Orbit, may\r\nbe found (by means of a Table of Equations of the Moon's Centre made to\r\nevery degree of the mean Anomaly, and some Eccentricities, _viz._ 45000,\r\n50000, 55000, 60000, and 65000) the _Prostaphæresis_, or Equation of the\r\nMoon's Centre, as in the common way: And this being taken from the\r\nformer Semi-circle of the middle Anomaly, and added in the latter to the\r\nMoon's Place thus thrice equated, will produce the Place of the Moon a\r\nfourth time equated.\r\n\r\nThe greatest Variation of the Moon (_viz._ that which happens when the\r\nMoon is in an Octant with the Sun) is nearly, reciprocally as the Cube\r\nof the Distance of the Sun from the Earth. Let that be taken 37 minutes,\r\n25 seconds, when the Sun is _in Perigæo_, and 33 minutes, 40 seconds,\r\nwhen he is _in Apogæo_: And let the Differences of this Variation in the\r\nOctants be made reciprocally, as the Cubes of the Distances of the Sun\r\nfrom the Earth; and so let a Table be made of the aforesaid Variation of\r\nthe Moon in her Octants (or its Logarithms) to every Tenth, Sixth, or\r\nFifth Degree of the mean Anomaly: And for the Variation out of the\r\nOctants, make, as Radius to the Sine of the double Distance of the Moon\r\nfrom the next Syzygy, or Quadrature :: so let the afore-found Variation\r\nin the Octant be to the Variation congruous to any other Aspect; and\r\nthis added to the Moon's Place before found in the first and third\r\nQuadrant (accounting from the Sun) or subducted from it in the second\r\nand fourth, will give the Moon's Place equated a fifth time.\r\n\r\nAgain, as Radius to the Sine of the Summ of the Distances of the Moon\r\nfrom the Sun, and of her Apogee from the Sun's Apogee (or the Sine of\r\nthe Excess of that Summ above 360 degrees,) :: so is 2 minutes, 10\r\nseconds, to a sixth Equation of the Moon's Place, which must be\r\nsubtracted, if the aforesaid Summ or Excess be less than a Semi-circle;\r\nbut added, if it be greater. Let it be made also, as Radius to the Sine\r\nof the Moon's distance from the Sun :: so 2 degrees, 20 secants, to a\r\nseventh Equation; which when the Moon's Light is increasing, add; but\r\nwhen decreasing, subtract; and the Moon's Place will be equated a\r\nseventh time, and this is her Place _in her proper Orbit_.\r\n\r\nNote here, the Equation thus produced by the mean Quantity 2 degrees, 20\r\nseconds, is not always of the same magnitude; but is increased and\r\ndiminished, according to the Position of the Lunar Apogee. For if the\r\nMoon's Apogee be in Conjunction with the Sun's, the aforesaid Equation\r\nis about 54 seconds greater: But when the Apogees are in Opposition,\r\n'tis about as much less; and it librates between its greatest Quantity 3\r\nminutes, 14 seconds, and its least, 1 minute, 26 seconds. And this is,\r\nwhen the Lunar Apogee is in Conjunction, or Opposition with the Sun's:\r\nBut in the Quadratures, the aforesaid Equation is to be lessen'd about\r\n50 seconds, or 1 minute, when the Apogees of the Sun and Moon are in\r\nConjunction; but if they are in Opposition, for want of a sufficient\r\nnumber of Observations, I cannot determine, whether it is to be lessen'd\r\nor increas'd. And even as to the Argument or Decrement of the Equation,\r\n2 minutes, 20 seconds, above mentioned, I dare determine nothing\r\ncertain, for the same Reason, _viz._ the want of Observations accurately\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nIf the sixth and seventh Equations are augmented or diminished in a\r\nreciprocal _Ratio_ of the distance of the Moon from the Earth; _i. e._\r\nin a direct _Ratio_ of the Moon's Horizontal Parallax, they will become\r\nmore accurate: And this may be readily done, if Tables are first made to\r\neach minute of the said Parallax, and to every sixth or fifth degree of\r\nthe Argument of the sixth Equation for the Sixth, as of the distance of\r\nthe Moon from the Sun, for the Seventh Equation.\r\n\r\nFrom the Sun's Place, take the mean motion of the Moon's ascending Node,\r\nequated as above; the Remainder shall be the Annual Argument of the\r\nNode, whence its second Equation may be computed after the following\r\nmanner in the preceding Figure.\r\n\r\nLet T, as before, represent the Earth; TS a Right Line, conjoining the\r\nEarth and Sun: Let also the Line TACB, be drawn to the Place of the\r\nascending Node of the Moon, as above equated; and let STA be the Annual\r\nArgument of the Node. Take TA from a Scale, and let it be to AB :: as 56\r\nto 3, or as 11⅔ to 1. Then bissect BA in C, and on C as a Centre,\r\nwith the Distance CA, describe a Circle, as AFB, and make the Angle BCF,\r\nequal to double the Annual Argument of the Node before-found: So shall\r\nthe Angle BTF, be the second Equation of the ascending Node; which must\r\nbe added, when the Node is passing from the Quadrature to a Syzygy with\r\nthe Sun; and subducted, when the Node moves from a Syzygy towards a\r\nQuadrature. By which means, the true Place of the Node of the Lunar\r\nOrbit will be gained: Whence from Tables made after the common way, the\r\n_Moon's Latitude, and the Reduction of her Orbit to the Ecliptick_, may\r\nbe computed, supposing the Inclination of the Moon's Orbit to the\r\nEcliptick, to be 4 degrees, 59 minutes, 35 seconds, when the Nodes are\r\nin Quadrature with the Sun; and 5 degrees, 17 minutes, 20 seconds, when\r\nthey are in the Syzygys.\r\n\r\nAnd from the Longitude and Latitude thus found, and the given Obliquity\r\nof the Ecliptick, 23 degrees, 29 minutes, the Right Ascension and\r\nDeclination of the Moon will be found.\r\n\r\nThe Horizontal Parallax of the Moon, when she is in the Syzygys, at a\r\nmean distance from the Earth, I make to be 57 minutes, 30 seconds; and\r\nher Horary Motion, 33 minutes, 32 seconds, 32 thirds; and her apparent\r\nDiameter 31 minutes, 30 seconds. But in her Quadratures at a mean\r\nDistance from the Earth, I make the Horizontal Parallax of the Moon to\r\nbe 59 minutes, 40 seconds, her Horary Motion 32 minutes, 12 seconds, 2\r\nthirds, and her apparent Diameter, 31 minutes, 3 seconds. The Moon in an\r\nOctant to the Sun, and at a mean distance, hath her Centre distant from\r\nthe Centre of the Earth about 60-2/9 of the Earth's Semi-diameters.\r\n\r\nThe Sun's Horizontal Parallax I make to be 10 seconds, and its apparent\r\nDiameter at a mean distance from the Earth, I make 32 minutes, 15\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nThe Atmosphere of the Earth, by dispersing and refracting the Sun's\r\nLight, casts a Shadow, as if it were an Opake Body, at least to the\r\nheight of 40 or 50 Geographical Miles (by a Geographical Mile, I mean\r\nthe sixtieth part of a Degree of a great Circle, on the Earth's\r\nSurface.) This Shadow falling upon the Moon in a Lunar Eclipse, makes\r\nthe Earth's Shadow be the larger or broader. And to each Mile of the\r\nEarth's Atmosphere, is correspondent a Second in the Moon's Disk, so\r\nthat the Semi-diameter of the Earth's shadow projected upon the Disk of\r\nthe Moon, is to be increased about 50 seconds: Or, which is all one, in\r\na Lunar Eclipse, the Horizontal Parallax of the Moon is to be increased\r\nin the Ratio of about 70 to 69.\r\n\r\nThus far the Theory of this Incomparable Mathematician. And if we had\r\nmany Places of the Moon accurately observ'd, especially about her\r\nQuadratures, and these well compar'd with her Places, at the same time\r\ncalculated according to this Theory; it would then appear, whether there\r\nyet remain any other sensible Equations; which when accounted for, might\r\nserve to improve and enlarge this Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An Estimate of the Degrees of the _Mortality_ of Mankind, drawn from\r\n   curious _Tables_ of the _Births_ and _Funerals_ at the City of\r\n   _Breslaw_; with an Attempt to ascertain the Price of _Annuities_ upon\r\n   _Lives_. By Mr. _E. Halley_, R. S. S._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Contemplation of the _Mortality_ of _Mankind_, has besides the\r\n_Moral_, its _Physical_ and _Political_ Uses, both which have been some\r\nYears since most judiciously consider'd by the Curious Sir _William\r\nPetty_, in his _Natural_ and _Political_ Observations on the Bills of\r\n_Mortality_ of _London_, own'd by Captain _John Graunt_: And since in a\r\nlike Treatise on the Bills of _Mortality_ of _Dublin_. But the Deduction\r\nfrom those Bills of _Mortality_ seemed even to their Authors to be\r\ndefective: First, In that the _Number_ of the People was wanting.\r\nSecondly, That the _Ages_ of the People dying was not to be had. And\r\nLastly, That both _London_ and _Dublin_, by reason of the great and\r\ncasual Accession of _Strangers_ who die therein, (as appeared in both,\r\nby the great Excess of the _Funerals_ above the _Births_) rendred them\r\nincapable of being Standards for this purpose; which requires, if it\r\nwere possible, that the People we treat of, should not at all be\r\nchanged, but die where they were born, without any adventitious Increase\r\nfrom Abroad, or Decay by Migration elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate 3. pag. 280._]\r\n\r\nThis _Defect_ seems in a great measure to be satisfied by the late\r\ncurious Tables of the Bills of _Mortality_ at the City of _Breslaw_,\r\nlately communicated to this Honourable Society by Mr. _Justell_, wherein\r\nboth the Ages and Sexes of all that die, are Monthly delivered, and\r\ncompared with the number of the _Births_, for Five Years last past,\r\n_viz._ 1687, 88, 89, 90, 91, seeming to be done with all the Exactness\r\nand Sincerity possible.\r\n\r\nThis City of _Breslaw_ is the Capital City of the Province of _Silesia_;\r\nor, as the _Germans_ call it, _Schlesia_, and is situated on the Western\r\nBank of the River _Oder_, anciently call'd _Viadrus_, near the Confines\r\nof _Germany_ and _Poland_, and very nigh the Latitude of _London_. It is\r\nvery far from the Sea, and as much a _Mediterranean_ Place as can be\r\ndesired, whence the Confluence of Strangers is but small, and the\r\nManufacture of Linnen employs chiefly the poor People of the Place, as\r\nwell as of the Country round about; whence comes that sort of Linnen we\r\nusually call your _Sclesiæ Linnen_; which is the chief, if not the only\r\nMerchandize of the Place. For these Reasons, the People of this City\r\nseem most proper for a _Standard_; and the rather, for that the _Births_\r\ndo a small matter exceed the Funerals. The only thing wanting, is the\r\nNumber of the whole People, which in some measure I have endeavour'd to\r\nsupply, by the comparison of the _Mortality_ of the People of all Ages,\r\nwhich I shall from the said Bills trace out with all the Accuracy\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in the Five Years mentioned, _viz._ from 87 to 91\r\ninclusive, there were born 6193 Persons, and buried 5869; that is, born\r\n_per Annum_ 1238, and buried 1174; whence an _Increase_ of the People\r\nmay be argued of 64 _per Annum_, or of about a 20th part, which may\r\nperhaps be balanc'd by the Levies for the _Emperor_'s Service in his\r\nWars. But this being contingent, and the Births certain, I will suppose\r\nthe People of _Breslaw_ to be increased by 1238 _Births_ annually. Of\r\nthese it appears by the same Tables, that 348 do die _yearly_ in the\r\n_first Year_ of their _Age_, and that but 890 do arrive at a full\r\n_Year's Age_; and likewise, that 198 do die in the _Five Years_ between\r\n1 and 6 compleat, taken at a _Medium_; so that but 692 of the Persons\r\n_born_ do survive _Six_ whole _Years_. From this _Age_ the Infants being\r\narrived at some degree of Firmness, grow less and less _Mortal_; and it\r\nappears, that of the whole People of _Breslaw_ there die _yearly_, as in\r\nthe following Table, wherein the upper Line shews the _Age_, and the\r\nnext under it, the _Number_ of Persons of that Age _dying yearly_.\r\n\r\n  7   8  9      14     18     21     27  28    35\r\n 11  11  6  5½   2  3½  5  6  4½  6½  9   8  7  7\r\n\r\n 36     42    45     39  54  55  56      63\r\n  8  9½  8  9  7  7  10  11   9   9  10  12\r\n\r\n     70  71  72     77    81    84    90  91\r\n 9½  14   9  11  9½  6  7  3  4  2  1  1   1\r\n\r\n 98   99   100\r\n  0    ⅕     ⅗\r\n\r\nAnd where no Figure is placed over, it is to be understood of those that\r\ndie between the Ages of the precedent and consequent _Column_.\r\n\r\nFrom this Table it is evident, that from the Age of 9 to about 25, there\r\ndoes not die above 6 _per Annum_ of each Age, which is much about 1 _per\r\nCent._ of those that are of those _Ages_: And whereas in the 14, 15, 16,\r\n17 _Years_, there appear to die much fewer, as 2 and 3½; yet that\r\nseems rather to be attributed to Chance, as are the other Irregularities\r\nin the Series of Ages, which would rectifie themselves, were the number\r\nof Years much more considerable, as 20 instead of 5. And by our own\r\nExperience in _Christ-Church Hospital_, I am inform'd there die of the\r\n_Young Lads_, much about 1 _per Cent. per Annum_, they being of the\r\naforesaid _Ages_. From 25 to 50, there seem to die from 7 to 8 and 9\r\n_per Annum_ of each Age; and after that to 70, they growing more\r\n_crasie_, though the number be much diminished, yet the _Mortality\r\nincreases_, and there are found to die 10 or 11 of each Age _per Annum_:\r\nFrom thence the number of the Living being grown very small, they\r\ngradually decline till there be none left to _die_; as may be seen at\r\none View in the Table.\r\n\r\nFrom these Considerations I have form'd the _adjoined Table_, whose Uses\r\nare manifold, and give a more just _Idea_ of the _State_ and _Condition_\r\nof _Mankind_, than any thing yet extant that I know of. It exhibits the\r\n_Number_ of _People_ in the City of _Breslaw_ of all Ages, from the\r\n_Birth_ to extreme _Old Age_, and thereby shews the Chances of\r\n_Mortality_ at all _Ages_, and likewise how to make a certain Estimate\r\nof the Value of _Annuities_ for _Lives_, which hitherto has been only\r\ndone by an imaginary _Valuation_: Also the _Chances_ that there are that\r\na _Person_ of any _Age_ proposed does live to any other _Age_ given;\r\nwith many more, as I shall hereafter shew. This _Table_ does shew the\r\n_Number_ of Persons that are living in the _Age_ current annexed\r\nthereto, as follows:\r\n\r\n +------+---------+------+---------+------+---------+\r\n | Age. | Persons.| Age. | Persons.| Age. | Persons.|\r\n | Curt.|         | Curt.|         | Curt.|         |\r\n +------+---------+------+---------+------+---------+\r\n |   1  |  1000   |   8  |   680   |  15  |   628   |\r\n |   2  |   855   |   9  |   670   |  16  |   622   |\r\n |   3  |   798   |  10  |   661   |  17  |   616   |\r\n |   4  |   760   |  11  |   653   |  18  |   610   |\r\n |   5  |   732   |  12  |   646   |  19  |   604   |\r\n |   6  |   710   |  13  |   640   |  20  |   598   |\r\n |   7  |   692   |  14  |   634   |  21  |   592   |\r\n +------+---------+------+---------+------+---------+\r\n |  22  |   586   |  29  |   539   |  36  |   481   |\r\n |  23  |   579   |  30  |   531   |  37  |   472   |\r\n |  24  |   573   |  31  |   523   |  38  |   463   |\r\n |  25  |   567   |  32  |   515   |  39  |   454   |\r\n |  26  |   560   |  33  |   507   |  40  |   445   |\r\n |  27  |   553   |  34  |   499   |  41  |   436   |\r\n |  28  |   546   |  35  |   490   |  42  |   427   |\r\n +------+---------+------+---------+------+---------+\r\n |  43  |   417   |  50  |   346   |  57  |   272   |\r\n |  44  |   407   |  51  |   335   |  58  |   262   |\r\n |  45  |   397   |  52  |   324   |  59  |   252   |\r\n |  46  |   387   |  53  |   313   |  60  |   242   |\r\n |  47  |   377   |  54  |   302   |  61  |   232   |\r\n |  48  |   367   |  55  |   292   |  62  |   222   |\r\n |  49  |   357   |  56  |   282   |  63  |   212   |\r\n +------+---------+------+---------+------+---------+\r\n |  64  |   202   |  71  |   131   |  78  |    58   |\r\n |  65  |   192   |  72  |   120   |  79  |    49   |\r\n |  66  |   182   |  73  |   109   |  80  |    41   |\r\n |  67  |   172   |  74  |    98   |  81  |    34   |\r\n |  68  |   162   |  75  |    88   |  82  |    28   |\r\n |  69  |   152   |  76  |    78   |  83  |    23   |\r\n |  79  |   142   |  77  |    68   |  84  |    20   |\r\n +------+---------+------+---------+------+---------+\r\n\r\n Age. Persons.\r\n\r\n   7    5547\r\n  14    4584\r\n  21    4270\r\n  28    3964\r\n  35    3604\r\n  42    3708\r\n  49    2709\r\n  56    2194\r\n  63    1694\r\n  70    1204\r\n  77     692\r\n  84     253\r\n 100     107\r\n -----------\r\n       34000\r\n -----------\r\n  Sum Total.\r\n\r\nThus it appears, that the whole People of _Breslaw_ does consist of\r\n34000 _Souls_, being the Sum _Total_ of the Persons of all Ages in the\r\n_Table_: The first use hereof is to shew the Proportion of _Men_ able to\r\nbear _Arms_ in any _Multitude_, which are those between 18 and 56,\r\nrather than 16 and 60; the one being generally too weak to bear the\r\n_Fatigues_ of _War_, and the Weight of _Arms_; and the other too crasie\r\nand infirm from _Age_, notwithstanding particular Instances to the\r\ncontrary. Under 18 from the _Table_, are found in this City 11997\r\nPersons, 3950 above 56, which together make 15947, so that the Residue\r\nto 34000 being 18053, are Persons between those _Ages_. At least one\r\nhalf thereof are Males, or 9027: So that the whole Force this City can\r\nraise of _Fencible Men_, as the _Scotch_ call them, is about 9000, or\r\n9/34, or somewhat more than a quarter of the _Number_ of _Souls_; which\r\nmay parhaps pass for a Rule for all other places.\r\n\r\nThe _Second Use_ of this _Table_, is, to shew the differing degrees of\r\n_Mortality_, or rather _Vitality_, in all _Ages_; for if the Number of\r\nPersons of any _Age_ remaining after one Year, be divided by the\r\ndifference between that and the number of the _Age_ proposed, it shews\r\nthe _Odds_ that there is, that a Person of that _Age_ does not die in a\r\n_Year_. As for Instance, a Person of 25 _Years_ of _Age_ has the Odds of\r\n560 to 7, or 80 to 1, that he does not _die_ in a _Year_: Because that\r\nof 567, living of 25 _Years_ of _Age_, there do die no more than 7 in a\r\n_Year_, leaving 560 of 26 Years old.\r\n\r\nSo likewise for the _Odds_, that any Person does not die before he\r\nattain any proposed _Age_: Take the _number_ of the remaining Persons of\r\nthe _Age_ proposed, and divide it by the difference between it and the\r\nnumber of those of the _Age_ of the Party proposed; and that shews the\r\n_Odds_ there is between the Chances of the Party's living or dying. As\r\nfor Instance; What is the _Odds_ that a Man of 40 lives 7 Years: Take\r\nthe number of Persons of 47 Years, which in the Table is 377, and\r\nsubtract it from the number of Persons of 40 Years, which is 445, and\r\nthe _difference_ is 68: Which shews that the _Persons dying_ in that 7\r\nYears, are 68, and that it is 377 to 68, or 5½ to 1, that a Man of 40\r\ndoes live 7 Years. And the like for any other _number_ of _Years_.\r\n\r\n_Use_ III. But if it be enquired at what number of _Years_, it is an\r\neven Lay that a Person of any _Age_ shall die, this Table readily\r\nperforms it; For if the _number_ of Persons _living_ of the _Age_\r\nproposed, be _halfed_, it will be found by the _Table_ at what Year the\r\nsaid _Number_ is reduced to half by _Mortality_; and that is the _Age_,\r\nto which it is an even Wager, that a Person of the _Age_ proposed shall\r\narrive before he _die_. As for Instance; A Person of 30 Years of _Age_\r\nis proposed, the number of that _Age_ is 531, the half thereof is 265,\r\nwhich number I find to be between 57 and 58 Years; so that a Man of 30\r\nmay reasonably expect to live between 27 and 28 Years.\r\n\r\n_Use_ IV. By what has been said, the _Price_ of _Insurance_ upon Lives\r\nought to be regulated, and the difference is discovered between the\r\n_Price_ of insuring the _Life_ of a _Man_ of 20 and 50. For Example; It\r\nbeing 100 to 1, that a Man of 20 dies not in a Year, and but 38 to 1,\r\nfor a Man of 50 Years of Age.\r\n\r\n_Use_ V. On this depends the Valuation of _Annuities_ upon _Lives_; for\r\nit is plain, that the _Purchaser_ ought to pay for only such a part of\r\nthe Value of the _Annuity_, as he has Chances that he is living; and\r\nthis ought to be computed yearly, and the Sum of all those yearly Values\r\nbeing added together, will amount to the Value of the _Annuity_ for the\r\n_Life_ of the Person proposed. Now the present Value of Money payable\r\nafter a Term of Years, at any given Rate of Interest, either may be had\r\nfrom Tables already computed; or almost as compendiously, by the Table\r\nof Logarithms: For the Arithmetical Complement of the Logarithm of\r\nUnity, and its yearly Interest, (that is, of 1,06 for Six _per Cent._\r\nbeing 9,974694.) being multiplied by the number of Years proposed, gives\r\nthe present Value of One Pound payable after the end of so many Years.\r\nThen by the foregoing Proposition, it will be as the number of Persons\r\nliving after that Term of Years, to the number dead; so are the Odds\r\nthat any one Person is alive or dead. And by consequence, as the Sum of\r\nboth, or the number of Persons living of the _Age_ first proposed, to\r\nthe number remaining after so many Years, (both given by the Table) so\r\nthe present Value of the yearly Sum payable after the Term proposed, to\r\nthe Sum which ought to be paid for the Chance the Person has to enjoy\r\nsuch an _Annuity_ after so many Years. And this being repeated for every\r\nYear of the Person's Life, the Sum of all the present Values of those\r\nChances is the true Value of the Annuity. This will without doubt appear\r\nto be a most laborious Calculation; but it being one of the principal\r\nUses of this Speculation, and having found some _Compendia_ for the\r\nWork, I took the pains to compute the following Table, being the short\r\nResult of a not ordinary number of Arithmetical Operations: It shews the\r\nValue of Annuities for every Fifth Year of Age, to the Seventieth, as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n +------+------------+------+------------+------+------------+\r\n | Age. | Years Pur. | Age. | Years Pur. | Age. | Years Pur. |\r\n +------+------------+------+------------+------+------------+\r\n |   1  |   10,28    |  25  |   12,27    |  50  |    9,21    |\r\n |   5  |   13,40    |  30  |   11,72    |  55  |    8,51    |\r\n |  10  |   13,44    |  35  |   11,12    |  60  |    7,60    |\r\n |  15  |   13,33    |  40  |   10,57    |  65  |    6,54    |\r\n |  20  |   12,78    |  45  |    9,91    |  70  |    5,32    |\r\n +------+------------+------+------------+------+------------+\r\n\r\nThis shews the great Advantage of putting Money into the present _Fund_\r\nlately granted to Their Majesties, giving 14 _per Cent. per Annum_, or\r\nat the Rate of 7 Years Purchase for a Life; when young Lives, at the\r\nusual Rate of Interest, are worth above 13 Years Purchase. It shews\r\nlikewise the Advantage of young Lives over those in Years; a Life of Ten\r\nYears being almost worth 13½ Years Purchase, whereas one of 36 is\r\nworth but 11.\r\n\r\n_Use_ VI. Two Lives are likewise valuable by the same Rule; for the\r\nnumber of Chances of each single Life, found in the Table, being\r\nmultiplied together, become the Chances of the Two Lives. And after any\r\ncertain Term of Years, the Product of the two remaining Sums is the\r\nChances that both the Persons are living. The Product of the two\r\nDifferences, being the numbers of the Dead of both Ages, are the Chances\r\nthat both the Persons are dead. And the two Products of the remaining\r\nSums of the one Age multiplied by those dead of the other, shew the\r\nChances that there are, that each Party survives the other: Whence is\r\nderived the Rule to estimate the Value of the Remainder of one Life\r\nafter another. Now as the Product of the Two Numbers in the Table for\r\nthe Two Ages proposed, is to the difference between that Product, and\r\nthe Product of the two numbers of Persons deceased in any space of time;\r\nso is the Value of a Sum of Money to be paid after so much time, to the\r\nValue thereof under the Contingency of Mortality. And as the aforesaid\r\nProduct of the two Numbers answering to the Ages proposed, to the\r\nProduct of the Deceased of one Age multiplied by those remaining alive\r\nof the other; so the Value of a Sum of Money to be paid after any time\r\nproposed, to the Value of the Chances, that the one Party has that he\r\nsurvives the other, whose number of Deceased you made use of, in the\r\nsecond Term of the Proportion. This perhaps may be better understood, by\r\nputting _N_ for the number of the younger Age, and _n_ for that of the\r\nElder; _Y_, _y_ the Deceased of both Ages respectively, and _R_, _r_ for\r\nthe Remainders; and _R + Y_ = _N_, and _r + y_ = _n_. Then shall _Nn_ be\r\nthe whole Number of Chances; _Nn - Yy_ be the Chances that one of the\r\ntwo Persons is living, _Yy_ the Chances that they are both dead; _Ry_\r\nthe Chances that the elder Person is dead, and the younger living; and\r\n_rY_ the Chances, that the elder is living, and the younger dead. Thus\r\ntwo Persons of 18 and 35 are proposed, and after 8 Years these Chances\r\nare required. The Numbers for 18 and 35, are 610 and 490; and there are\r\n50 of the First Age dead in 8 Years, and 73 of the Elder Age. There are\r\nin all 610 × 490, or 298900 Chances; of these there are 50 × 73, or\r\n3650, that they are both dead. And as 298900, to 298900 - 3650, or\r\n295250: So is the present Value of a Sum of Money to be paid after 8\r\nYears, to the present Value of a Sum to be paid, if either of the two\r\nlive. And as 560 × 73, so are the Chances that the Elder is dead,\r\nleaving the Younger; and as 417 × 50, so are the Chances that the\r\nYounger is dead, leaving the Elder. Wherefore as 610 × 490 to 560 × 73,\r\nso is the present Value of a Sum to be paid at 8 Years end, to the Sum\r\nto be paid for the Chance of the Younger's Survivance; and as 610 × 490\r\nto 417 × 50, so is the same present Value to the Sum to be paid for the\r\nChance of the Elder's Survivance.\r\n\r\nThis possibly may be yet better explained, by expounding these Products\r\nby Rectangular Parallelograms, as in _Fig. 7._ wherein _AB_ or _CD_\r\nrepresents the number of Persons of the younger Age, and _DE_, _BH_\r\nthose remaining alive after a certain Term of Years; whence _CE_ will\r\nanswer the number of those dead in that time: So _AC_, _BD_ may\r\nrepresent the number of the elder Age; _AF_, _BI_ the Survivors after\r\nthe same Term; and _CF_, _DI_, those of that Age that are dead at that\r\ntime. Then shall the whole Parallelogram _ABCD_ be _Nn_, or the Product\r\nof the two Numbers of Persons, representing such a number of Persons of\r\nthe two Ages given; and by what was said before, after the Term\r\nproposed, the Rectangle _HD_ shall be as the number of Persons of the\r\nyounger Age that survive, and the Rectangle _AE_ as the number of those\r\nthat die. So likewise the Rectangles _AI_, _FD_ shall be as the Numbers,\r\nliving and dead, of the other Age. Hence the Rectangle _HI_ shall be as\r\nan equal number of both Ages surviving. The Rectangle _FE_ being the\r\nProduct of the Deceased, or _Yy_, an equal number of both dead. The\r\nRectangle _GD_ or _Ry_, a number living of the younger Age, and dead of\r\nthe elder: And the Rectangle _AG_ or _rY_ a number living of the elder\r\nAge, but dead of the younger. This being understood, it is obvious, that\r\nas the whole Rectangle _AD_ or _Nn_ is to the _Gnomon FABDEG_ or\r\n_Nn - Yy_, so is the whole number of Persons or Chances, to the number of\r\nChances that one of the two Persons is living: And as _AD_ or _Nn_ is to\r\n_FE_ or _Yy_, so are all the Chances, to the Chances that both are dead;\r\nwhereby may be computed the Value of the Reversion after both Lives. And\r\nas _AD_ to _GD_ or _Ry_, so the whole number of Chances, to the Chances\r\nthat the younger is living, and the other dead; whereby may be cast up\r\nwhat Value ought to be paid for the Reversion of one Life after another,\r\nas in the Case of providing for Clergy-men's Widows, and others, by such\r\nReversions. And as _AD_ to _AG_, or _rY_, so are all the Chances, to\r\nthose that the elder survives the younger. I have been the more\r\nparticular, and perhaps tedious, in this Matter, because it is the Key\r\nto the Case of Three Lives, which of it self would not have been so\r\neasie to comprehend.\r\n\r\nVII. If Three Lives are proposed, to find the Value of an Annuity during\r\nthe continuance of any of those three Lives; the Rule is, _As the\r\nProduct of the continual Multiplication of the Three Numbers, in the\r\nTable, answering to the Ages proposed, is to the difference of that\r\nProduct, and of the Product of the Three Numbers of the Deceased of\r\nthose Ages, in any given Term of Years: So is the present Value of a Sum\r\nof Money, to be paid certainly after so many Years, to the present Value\r\nof the same Sum to be paid, provided one of those Three Persons be\r\nliving at the Expiration of that Term._ Which Proportion being yearly\r\nrepeated, the Sum of all those present Values will be the Value of an\r\nAnnuity granted for three such Lives. But to explain this, together with\r\nall the Cases of Survivance in Three Lives: Let _N_ be the Number in the\r\nTable for the younger Age, _n_ for the second, and ν for the elder\r\nAge; let _Y_ be those dead of the younger Age in the Term proposed, _y_\r\nthose dead of the second Age, and υ those of the elder Age; and let\r\n_R_ be the Remainder of the younger Age, _r_ that of the middle Age, and\r\nρ the Remainder of the elder Age. Then shall _R + Y_ be equal to _N_,\r\n_r + y_ to _n_, and ρ + υ to ν, and the continual Product of the\r\nthree Numbers _N_, _n_, ν, shall be equal to the continual Product of\r\n_R + Y × r + y × ρ + υ_, which being the whole Number of Chances for\r\nthree Lives, is compounded of the eight Products following. (1) _Rrρ_,\r\nwhich is the Number of Chances that all three of the Persons are living.\r\n(2) _rρY_, which is the Number of Chances that the two elder Persons\r\nare living, and the younger dead. (3) _Rρy_ the Number of Chances that\r\nthe middle Age is dead, and the younger and elder living. (4) _Rrυ_\r\nbeing the Chances that the two younger are living, and the elder dead.\r\n(5) _ρYy_ the Chances that the two younger are dead, and the elder\r\nliving. (6) _rYυ_ the Chances that the younger and elder are dead, and\r\nthe middle Age living. (7) _Ryυ_, which are the Chances that the\r\nyounger is living, and the two other dead. And Lastly and Eighthly,\r\n_Yyυ_, which are the Chances that all three are dead. Which latter\r\nsubtracted from the whole Number of Chances _Nnν_, leaves _Nnν -\r\nYyυ_ the Sum of all the other seven Products; in all of which one or\r\nmore of the three Persons are surviving.\r\n\r\nTo make this yet more evident, I have added _Fig. 8._ wherein these\r\neight several Products are at one view exhibited. Let the rectangled\r\nParallelepipedon _ABCDEFGH_ be constituted of the sides _AB_, _GH_,\r\n_&c._ proportional to _N_ the Number of the younger Age; _AC_, _BD_,\r\n_&c._ proportional to _n_; and _AG_, _CE_, _&c._ proportional to the\r\nNumber of the elder, or ν. And the whole Parallelepipedon shall be as\r\nthe Product _Nnν_, or our whole Number of Chances. Let _BP_ be as _R_,\r\nand _AP_ as _Y_; let _CL_ be as _r_, and _Ln_ as _y_; and _GN_ as ρ,\r\nand _NA_ as υ; and let the Plain _PRea_ be made parallel to the Plain\r\n_ACGE_; the Plain _NVbY_ parallel to _ABCD_; and the Plain _LXTQ_\r\nparallel to the Plain _ABGH_. And our first Product _Rrρ_ shall be as\r\nthe Solid _STWIFZeb_. The Second, or _rρY_ will be as the Solid\r\n_EYZeQSMI_. The Third, _Rρy_, as the Solid _RHOVWIST_. And the Fourth,\r\n_Rrυ_, as the Solid _ZabDWXIK_. Fifthly, _ρYy_, as the Solid\r\n_GQRSIMNO_. Sixthly, _rYυ_, as _IKLMGYZA_. Seventhly, _Ryυ_, as the\r\nSolid _IKPOBXVW_. And Lastly, _AIKLMNOP_ will be as the Product of the 3\r\nNumbers of Persons dead, or _Yyυ_. I shall not apply this in all the\r\nCases thereof, for brevity sake; only to shew in one how all the rest\r\nmay be performed, let it be demanded what is the Value of the Reversion\r\nof the younger Life after the two elder proposed. The proportion is as\r\nthe whole Number of Chances, or _Nnν_ to the Product _Ryυ_; so is\r\nthe certain present Value of the Sum payable after any Term proposed, to\r\nthe Value due to such Chances as the younger Person has to bury both the\r\nelder, by the Term proposed; which therefore he is to pay for. Here it\r\nis to be noted, that the first Term of all these Proportions is the same\r\nthroughout, _viz._ _Nnν_. The second changing yearly according to the\r\nDecrease of _R_, _r_, _ρ_, and Increase of _Y_, _y_, _υ_.

For\r\nExample; Let there be Three Lives of 10, 30, and 40 Years of Age\r\nproposed, and the Proportions will be thus;\r\n\r\n As 661 in 531 in 445 or 156190995, or _Nnν_\r\n to 8 in 8 in 9, or 576, or _Yyυ_ for the first\r\n Year, so 0,9434. to 0,00000348.\r\n\r\n To 15 in 16 in 18, or 4320, for the second\r\n Year, so 0,8900. to 0,00002462.\r\n\r\n To 21 in 24 in 28, or 14112 for the third\r\n Year, so 0,8396. to 0,00008128.\r\n\r\n To 27 in 32 in 38, for the fourth Year, so\r\n 0,7921. to 0,00016650.\r\n\r\n To 33 in 41 in 48, for the fifth Year, so\r\n 0,7473. to 0,00031071.\r\n\r\n To 39 in 50 in 58, for the sixth Year, so\r\n 0,7050. to 0,00051051.\r\n\r\nAnd so forth to the 60th Year, when we suppose the elder Life of Forty\r\ncertainly to be expired; from whence till Seventy we must compute for\r\nthe First and Second only, and from thence to Ninety for the single\r\nyoungest Life. Then the Sum Total of all these Fourth Proportionals\r\nbeing taken out of the Value of a certain Annuity for 90 Years, being\r\n16,58 Years Purchase, shall leave the just Value to be paid for an\r\nAnnuity during the whole Term of the Lives of Three Persons of the Ages\r\nproposed. And note, that it will not be necessary to compute for every\r\nYear singly; but that in most Cases every 4th or 5th Year may suffice,\r\ninterpoling for the intermediate Years _seceundum artem_.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, that the different _Salubrity_ of Places does hinder\r\nthis Proposal from being _universal_; nor can it be denied. But by the\r\nNumber that die, being 1174. _per Annum_ in 34000, it does appear that\r\nabout a 30th part die yearly, as Sir _William Petty_ has computed for\r\n_London_; and the Number that die in Infancy, is a good Argument that\r\nthe Air is but indifferently salubrious. So that by what I can learn,\r\nthere cannot perhaps be one better Place proposed for a Standard. At\r\nleast 'tis desired, that in Imitation hereof the Curious in other Cities\r\nwould attempt something of the same Nature, than which nothing perhaps\r\ncan be more useful.\r\n\r\nWere this _Calculus_ founded on the Experience of a very great number of\r\nYears, it would be very well worth the while to think of Methods for\r\nfacilitating the Computation of the Value of two, three, or more Lives;\r\nwhich, as proposed in my former, seems (as I am inform'd) a Work of too\r\nmuch Difficulty for the ordinary Arithmetician to undertake.\r\n\r\nI have sought, If it were possible, to find a Theorem that might be more\r\nconcise than the Rules there laid down, but in vain; for all that can be\r\ndone to expedite it, is, by Tables of Logarithms ready computed, to\r\nexhibit the _Rationes_ of _N_ to _Y_ in each single Life, for every\r\nthird, fourth, or fifth Year of Age, as occasion shall require; and\r\nthese Logarithms being added to the Logarithms of the present Value of\r\nMoney payable after so many Years, will give a Series of Numbers, the\r\nSum of which will shew the Value of the Annuity sought. However, for\r\neach Number of this Series, two Logarithms for a single Life, three for\r\ntwo Lives, and four for three Lives, must necessarily be added together.\r\nIf you think the Matter, under the Uncertainties I have mentioned, to\r\ndeserve it, I shall shortly give you such a Table of Logarithms, as I\r\nspeak of, and an Example or two of the use thereof: But by Vulgar\r\nArithmetick, the Labour of these Numbers were immense; and nothing will\r\nmore recommend the useful Invention of Logarithms to all Lovers of\r\nNumbers, than the advantage of Dispatch in this and such like\r\nComputations.\r\n\r\nBesides the Uses mentioned, it may perhaps not be an unacceptable thing\r\nto infer from the same Tables, how unjustly we repine at the shortness\r\nof our Lives, and think our selves wronged if we attain not old Age;\r\nwhereas it appears hereby, that the one half of those that are born are\r\ndead in Seventeen Years time, 1238 being in that time reduced to 616. So\r\nthat instead of murmuring at what we call an untimely Death, we ought\r\nwith Patience and Unconcern to submit to that Dissolution which is the\r\nnecessary Condition of our perishable Materials, and of our nice and\r\nfrail Structure and Composition: And to account it as a Blessing that we\r\nhave survived, perhaps by many Years, that Period of Life, whereat the\r\none half of the whole Race of Mankind does not arrive.\r\n\r\nA second Observation I make upon the said Table, is that the Growth and\r\nIncrease of Mankind is not so much stinted by any thing in the Nature of\r\nthe _Species_, as it is from the cautious difficulty most People make to\r\nadventure on the State of _Marriage_, from the Prospect of the Trouble\r\nand Charge of providing for a Family. Nor are the poorer sort of People\r\nherein to be blamed, since their difficulty of subsisting is occasion'd\r\nby the unequal Distribution of Possessions, all being necessarily fed\r\nfrom the Earth, of which yet so few are Masters. So that besides\r\nthemselves and Families, they are yet to work for those who own the\r\nGround that feeds them: And of such does by very much the greater part\r\nof Mankind consist; otherwise it is plain, that there might well be four\r\ntimes as many Births as we now find. For by Computation from the Table,\r\nI find that there are nearly 15000 Persons above 16, and under 45, of\r\nwhich at least 7000 are Women capable to bear Children. Of these\r\nnotwithstanding there are but 1238 born yearly, which is but little more\r\nthan a sixth part: So that about one in six of these Women do breed\r\nyearly; whereas were they all married, it would not appear strange or\r\nunlikely, that four of six should bring a Child every Year. The\r\nPolitical Consequences hereof I shall not insist on; only the Strength\r\nand Glory of a King being in the multitude of his Subjects, I shall only\r\nhint, that above all things, Celibacy ought to be discouraged, as, by\r\nextraordinary Taxing and Military Service: And those who have numerous\r\nFamilies of Children to be countenanced and encouraged by such Laws as\r\nthe _Jus trium Liberorum_ among the _Romans_. But especially, by an\r\neffectual Care to provide for the Subsistence of the Poor, by finding\r\nthem Employments, whereby they may earn their Bread, without being\r\nchargeable to the Publick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A Discourse concerning _Gravity_, and its Properties, wherein the\r\n   Descent of _Heavy Bodies_, and the Motion of _Projects_ is briefly,\r\n   but fully handled: Together with the _Solution_ of a _Problem_ of\r\n   great Use in _Gunnery_. By _E. Halley_._\r\n\r\n\r\nNature, amidst the great Variety of _Problems_, wherewith She exercises\r\nthe Wits of Philosophical Men, scarce affords any one wherein the Effect\r\nis more visible, and the Cause more concealed, than in those of the\r\n_Phænomena_ of _Gravity_. Before we can go alone, we must learn to\r\ndefend our selves from the Violence of its Impulse, by not trusting the\r\n_Center_ of _Gravity_ of our Bodies beyond our reach; and yet the\r\nacutest Philosophers, and the subtilest Enquirers into the Original of\r\nthis Motion, have been so far from satisfying their Readers, that they\r\nthemselves seem little to have understood the Consequences of their own\r\n_Hypotheses_.\r\n\r\n_Des Cartes_ his Notion, I must needs confess to be to me incomprehensible,\r\nwhile he will have the Particles of his _Cœlestial Matter_, by being\r\nreflected on the Surface of the _Earth_, and so ascending therefrom, to\r\ndrive down into their Places those _Terrestrial Bodies_ they find above\r\nthem: This is, as near as I can gather, the Scope of the 20, 21, 22, and\r\n23 _Sections_ of the last Book of his _Principia Philosophiæ_; yet\r\nneither he, nor any of his Followers, can shew how a Body suspended in\r\n_Libero Æthere_, shall be carried downwards by a continual Impulse\r\ntending upwards, and acting upon all its Parts equally: And besides the\r\nObscurity wherewith he expresses himself, particularly, _Sect. 23._ does\r\nsufficiently argue according to his own Rules, the confused _Idea_ he\r\nhad of the thing he wrote.\r\n\r\nOthers, and among them Dr. _Vossius_, assert the Cause of the _Descent_\r\nof _heavy Bodies_, to be the _Diurnal Rotation_ of the _Earth_ upon its\r\n_Axis_, without considering, that according to the Doctrine of Motion\r\nfortified with Demonstration, all Bodies moved _in Circulo_, would\r\nrecede from the Center of their Motion; whereby the contrary to\r\n_Gravity_ would follow, and all loose Bodies would be cast into the Air\r\nin a _Tangent_ to the _Parallel_ of _Latitude_, without the intervention\r\nof some other Principle to keep them fast, such as is that of _Gravity_.\r\nBesides, the Effect of this Principle is throughout the whole Surface of\r\nthe Globe found nearly equal; and certain Experiments have proved it\r\nrather less near the _Æquinoctial_, than towards the _Poles_; which\r\ncould not be by any means, if the _Diurnal Rotation_ of the _Earth_ upon\r\nits _Axis_ were the Cause of _Gravity_; for where the Motion was\r\nswiftest, the Effect would be most considerable.\r\n\r\nOthers assign the Pressure of the _Atmosphere_, to be the Cause of this\r\nTendency towards the Center of the Earth; but unhappily they have\r\nmistaken the Cause for the Effect; it being from undoubted Principles\r\nplain, that the _Atmosphere_ has no other Pressure but what it derives\r\nfrom its _Gravity_; and that the Weight of the upper Parts of the _Air_,\r\npressing on the lower Parts thereof, do so far bend the Springs of that\r\n_Elastick_ Body, as to give it a Force equal to the Weight that\r\ncompress'd it, having of it self no force at all: And supposing it had,\r\nit will be very hard to explain the _Modus_, how that Pressure should\r\noccasion the Descent of a Body circumscribed by it, and pressed equally\r\nabove and below, without some other Force to draw, or thrust it\r\ndownwards. But to demonstrate the contrary of this Opinion, an\r\n_Experiment_ was long since shewn before the _Royal Society_, whereby it\r\nappeared, that the _Atmosphere_ was so far from being the Cause of\r\n_Gravity_, that the Effects thereof were much more vigorous, where the\r\nPressure of the _Atmosphere_ was taken off; for a long _Glass-Receiver_\r\nhaving a light Down-feather included, being evacuated of Air, the\r\nFeather, which in the Air would hardly sink, did _in vacuo_ descend with\r\nnearly the same _Velocity_, as if it had been a Stone.\r\n\r\nSome think to illustrate this Descent of Heavy Bodies, by comparing it\r\nwith the Vertue of the _Loadstone_; but setting aside the difference\r\nthere is in the manner of their Attractions, the _Loadstone_ drawing\r\nonly in and about its Poles, and the Earth near equally in all Parts of\r\nits Surface, this Comparison avails no more than to explain _ignotum per\r\næque ignotum_.\r\n\r\nOthers assign a certain _Sympæthetical Attraction_ between the Earth and\r\nits Parts, whereby they have, as it were, a desire to be united, to be\r\nthe Cause we enquire after: But this is so far from explaining the\r\n_Modus_, that it is little more, than to tell us in other Terms, that\r\nHeavy Bodies descend, because they descend.\r\n\r\nThis, I say, not that I can pretend to substitute any Solution of this\r\nImportant Philosophical Problem, that shall more happily explicate the\r\nAppearances of Gravity; only it may be serviceable to those with whom\r\nthe Credit of great Authors sways much, and who too readily assent _in\r\nVerba Magistri_, to let them see that their Books are not always\r\ninfallible: Besides, the detection of Errors is the first and surest\r\nStep towards the discovery of Truth.\r\n\r\nThough the efficient Cause of _Gravity_ be so obscure, yet the final\r\nCause thereof is clear enough; for it is by this single _Principle_,\r\nthat the _Earth_ and all the _Cœlestial Bodies_ are kept from\r\n_Dissolution_; the least of their _Particles_ not being suffer'd to\r\nrecede far from their _Surfaces_, without being immediately brought down\r\nagain by Virtue of this _Natural Tendency_; which, for their\r\nPreservation, the Infinite Wisdom of their _Creator_ has ordained to be\r\ntowards each of their _Centers_; nor can the _Globes_ of the _Sun_ and\r\n_Planets_ otherwise be destroy'd, but by taking from them this Power of\r\nkeeping their Parts united.\r\n\r\nThe Affections or Properties of _Gravity_, and its manner of acting upon\r\n_Bodies falling_, have been in a great measure discovered, and most of\r\nthem made out by _Mathematical Demonstration_ in this our _Century_, by\r\nthe accurate diligence of _Galilæus_, _Torricellius_, _Hugenius_, and\r\nothers, and now lately by our worthy Countryman, Mr. _Isaac Newton_,\r\nwhich Properties it may be very material here to enumerate, that they\r\nmay serve for a Foundation to all those that shall be willing to spend\r\ntheir Thoughts in search of the true Cause of this _Descent of Bodies_.\r\n\r\nThe first Property is, That by this Principle of _Gravitation_, all\r\nBodies do descend towards a Point, which either is, or else is very near\r\nto the Center of Magnitude of the Earth and Sea, about which the Sea\r\nforms it self exactly into a _Spherical Surface_, and the _Prominences_\r\nof the Land, considering the Bulk of the whole, differ but insensibly\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, That this Point or Center of _Gravitation_, is fix'd within\r\nthe _Earth_, or at least has been so, ever since we have any _Authentick\r\nHistory_: For a Consequence of its Change, though never so little, would\r\nbe the over-flowing of the low Lands on that side of the _Globe_ towards\r\nwhich it approached, and the leaving new Islands bare on the opposite\r\nside, from which it receded; but for this Two Thousand Years it appears,\r\nthat the low Islands of the _Mediterranean Sea_ (near to which the\r\nancientest Writers liv'd) have continued much at the same height above\r\nthe Water, as they now are found; and no _Inundations_ or _Recesses_ of\r\nthe _Sea_ arguing any such Change, are recorded in History; excepting\r\nthe _Universal Deluge_, which can no better way be accounted for, than\r\nby supposing this Center of _Gravitation_ removed for a time, towards\r\nthe middle of the then inhabited Parts of the World; and a change of its\r\nPlace, but the Two Thousandth Part of the _Radius_ of this _Globe_, were\r\nsufficient to bury the Tops of the highest Hills under Water.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, That in all Parts of the _Surface_ of the _Earth_, or rather\r\nin all Points equidistant from its _Center_, the Force of _Gravity_ is\r\nnearly equal; so that the length of the _Pendulum_ vibrating _Seconds of\r\nTime_, is found in all Parts of the World to be very near the same. 'Tis\r\ntrue at St. _Helena_, in the _Latitude_ of 16 Degrees _South_, I found\r\nthat the _Pendulum_ of my Clock, which vibrated _Seconds_, needed to be\r\nmade shorter than it had been in _England_, by a very sensible Space\r\n(but which at that time I neglected to observe accurately) before it\r\nwould keep time; and since the like Observations have been made by the\r\n_French Observers_, near the _Æquinoctial_: Yet I dare not affirm, that\r\nin mine it proceeded from any other Cause, than the great Height of my\r\nPlace of Observation above the _Surface_ of the _Sea_, whereby the\r\n_Gravity_ being diminished, the length of the _Pendulum_ vibrating\r\n_Seconds_, is proportionably short'ned.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, That _Gravity_ does equally affect all _Bodies_, without\r\nregard either to their _Matter_, _Bulk_, or _Figure_; so that the\r\nImpediment of the _Medium_ being removed, the most compact and most\r\nloose, the greatest and smallest _Bodies_ would descend the same\r\n_Spaces_ in equal Times; the Truth thereof will appear from the\r\nExperiment I before-cited. In these two last Particulars, is shewn the\r\ngreat difference between _Gravity_ and _Magnetism_, the one affecting\r\nonly _Iron_, and that towards its _Poles_, the other all _Bodies_ alike\r\nin every part. As a _Corollary_, from hence it will follow, that there\r\nis no such thing as _positive Levity_, those things that appear light,\r\nbeing only comparatively so; and whereas several things rise and swim in\r\n_Fluids_, 'tis because, Bulk for Bulk, they are not so heavy as those\r\n_Fluids_; nor is there any Reason why _Cork_, for Instance, should be\r\nsaid to be light, because it swims on Water, any more than _Iron_,\r\nbecause it swims on _Mercury_.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly_, That this Power increases as you descend, and decreases as\r\nyou ascend from the Center, and that in the Proportion of the Squares of\r\nthe _Distances_ therefrom _reciprocally_, so as at a double Distance to\r\nhave but a quarter of the Force; this Property is the Principle on which\r\nMr. _Newton_ has made out all the _Phænomena_ of the _Cœlestial\r\nMotions_, so easily and naturally, that its Truth is past Dispute.\r\nBesides that, it is highly rational, that the _attractive_ or\r\n_gravitating_ Power should exert it self more vigorously in a small\r\nSphere, and weaker in a greater, in proportion as it is contracted or\r\nexpanded; and if so, seeing that the _Surfaces_ of _Spheres_ are as the\r\n_Squares_ of their _Radii_, this Power, at several Distances, will be as\r\nthe _Squares_ of those _Distances reciprocally_; and then its whole\r\nAction upon each _Spherical Surface_, be it great or small, will be\r\nalways equal. And this is evidently the Rule of _Gravitation_ towards\r\nthe _Centers_ of the _Sun_, _Jupiter_, _Saturn_ and the _Earth_, and\r\nthence is reasonably inferred, to be the general Principle observed by\r\n_Nature_, in all the rest of the _Cœlestial Bodies_.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal Affections of _Gravity_, from which the Rules of\r\nthe _Fall_ of _Bodies_, and the _Motion_ of _Projects_ are\r\n_Mathematically_ deducible. Mr. _Isaac Newton_ has shew'd how to define\r\nthe Spaces of the _Descent_ of a _Body_, let fall from any given height,\r\ndown to the _Center_, supposing the _Gravitation_ to increase, as in the\r\nfifth Property; but considering the smallness of heighth, to which any\r\n_Project_ can be made ascend, and over how little an _Arch_ of the\r\n_Globe_ it can be cast by any of our _Engines_, we may well enough\r\nsuppose the _Gravity_ equal throughout, and the Descents of _Projects_\r\nin parallel Lines, which in Truth are towards the _Center_, the\r\ndifference being so small as by no means to be discovered in _Practice_.\r\nThe _Opposition_ of the _Air_, 'tis true, is considerable against all\r\nlight Bodies moving through it, as likewise against small ones (of which\r\nmore hereafter) but in great and ponderous Shot, this Impediment is\r\nfound by _Experience_ but very small, and may safely be neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Propositions concerning the Descent of Heavy Bodies, and the Motion of\r\n_Projects_._\r\n\r\n_Prop. I._ The _Velocities_ of _Falling Bodies_, are proportionate to\r\nthe Times from the beginning of their _Falls_.\r\n\r\nThis follows, for that the Action of _Gravity_ being _continual_, in\r\nevery Space of Time, the falling Body receives a new Impulse, equal to\r\nwhat it had before, in the same Space of Time, received from the same\r\nPower: For Instance, in the first Second of Time, the falling Body has\r\nacquired a _Velocity_, which in that time would carry it to a certain\r\nDistance, suppose 32 Foot, and were there no new Force, would descend at\r\nthat rate with an _equable Motion_: But in the next Second of Time, the\r\nsame Power of _Gravity_ continually acting thereon, superadds a new\r\n_Velocity_ equal to the former; so that at the end of two Seconds, the\r\n_Velocity_ is double to what it was at the end of the first, and after\r\nthe same manner may it be proved to be triple, at the end of the third\r\nSecond, and so on. Wherefore the _Velocities_ of _falling Bodies_, are\r\nproportionate to the Time of their _Falls_, _Q. E. D._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate 4. pag. 310_]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prop. II._ The _Spaces_ described by the Fall of a Body, are as the\r\n_Squares_ of the Times, from the beginning of the _Fall_.\r\n\r\n_Demonstration._ Let AB (_Fig. 9. Tab. 4._) represent the _Time_ of the\r\n_Fall_ of a _Body_, BC perpendicular to AB, the _Velocity_ acquired at\r\nthe end of the _Fall_, and draw the Line AC; then divide the Line AB\r\nrepresenting the Time, into as many equal Parts as you please, as b, b,\r\nb, b, _&c._ and through these Points draw the Lines bc, bc, bc, bc,\r\n_&c._ parallel to BC, 'tis manifest that the several Lines, bc,\r\nrepresent the several _Velocities_ of the falling Body, in such Parts of\r\nthe _Time_ as Ab is of AB, by the former Proposition. It is evident\r\nlikewise, that the _Area_ ABC is the Sum of all the Lines bc being\r\ntaken, according to the Method of _Indivisibles_, infinitely many; so\r\nthat the _Area_ ABC represents the Sum of all the _Velocities_, between\r\nnone and BC supposed infinitely many; which Sum is as the Space\r\ndescended in the Time represented by AB. And by the same Reason the\r\n_Areas_ Abc, will represent the Spaces descended in the Times Ab; so\r\nthen the Spaces descended in the Times AB, Ab, are as the _Areas_ of the\r\n_Triangles_ ABC, Abc, which by the 20th of the 6 of _Euclid_, are as the\r\n_Squares_ of their _Homologous Sides_ AB, Ab, that is to say, of the\r\n_Times_: Wherefore the Descents of _falling Bodies_, are as the\r\n_Squares_ of the Times of their _Fall_, _Q. E. D._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prop. III._ The _Velocity_ which a _falling Body_ acquires in any Space\r\nof time, is double to that, wherewith it would have moved the Space,\r\ndescended by an equable Motion, in the same _time_.\r\n\r\n_Demonstration._ Draw the Line EC parallel to AB, and AE parallel to BC\r\nin the same _Fig. 9._ and compleat the _Parallelogram_ ABCE, it is\r\nevident that the _Area_ thereof may represent the Space, a _Body_ moved\r\nequably with the _Velocity_ BC would describe in the Time AB, and the\r\n_Triangle_ ABC represents the _Space_ describ'd by the _Fall_ of a\r\n_Body_, in the same Time AB, by the second Proposition. Now the\r\n_Triangle_ ABC is half of the _Parallelogram_ ABCE, and consequently the\r\nSpace described by the _Fall_, is half what would have been described by\r\nan _equable Motion_ with the _Velocity_ BC, in the same Time; wherefore\r\nthe _Velocity_ BC at the end of the _Fall_, is double to that\r\n_Velocity_, which in the Time AB, would have described the _Space\r\nfallen_, represented by the _Triangle_ ABC with an _equable Motion_, _Q.\r\nE. D._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prop. IV._ All _Bodies_ on or near the Surface of the _Earth_, in their\r\n_Fall_, descend so, as at the end of the first Second of Time, they have\r\ndescribed 16 Feet, 1 Inch, _London Measure_, and acquired the _Velocity_\r\nof 32 Feet, 2 Inches, in a Second.\r\n\r\nThis is made out from the 25th Proposition of the second Part of that\r\nexcellent Treatise of Mr. _Hugenius de Horologio Oscillatorio_; wherein\r\nhe demonstrates the time of the least _Vibrations_ of a _Pendulum_, to\r\nbe to the Time of the _Fall_ of a _Body_, from the heighth of half the\r\nlength of the _Pendulum_, as the _Circumference_ of a _Circle_ to its\r\n_Diameter_; whence, as a _Corollary_, it follows, That as the _Square_\r\nof the _Diameter_ to the _Square_ of the _Circumference_, so half the\r\nlength of the _Pendulum_ vibrating _Seconds_, to the _Space_ described\r\nby the _Fall_ of a _Body_ in a _Second_ of _Time_: And the Length of the\r\n_Pendulum_ vibrating _Seconds_, being found 39, 125, or ⅛ Inches, the\r\n_Descent_ in a _Second_ will be found by the aforesaid _Analogy_ 16 Foot\r\nand 1 Inch; and, by the third Proposition, the _Velocity_ will be double\r\nthereto; and near to this it hath been found by several Experiments,\r\nwhich by reason of the _swiftness_ of the _Fall_, cannot so exactly\r\ndetermine its _Quantity_. The Demonstration of _Hugenius_ being the\r\nConclusion of a long Train of _Consequences_, I shall for brevity sake\r\nomit; and refer you to his Book, where these things are more amply\r\ntreated of.\r\n\r\nFrom these Four _Propositions_, all _Questions_ concerning the\r\n_Perpendicular Fall of Bodies_, are easily _solved_, and either _Time_,\r\n_Height_, or _Velocity_ being assign'd, one may readily find the other\r\ntwo. From them likewise is the Doctrine of _Projects_ deducible,\r\nassuming the two following _Axioms_; _viz._ That a _Body_ set a moving,\r\nwill move on continually in a right _Line_ with an _equable Motion_,\r\nunless some other Force or Impediment intervene, whereby it is\r\naccelerated, or retarded, or deflected.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, That a _Body_ being agitated by two _Motions_ at a time,\r\ndoes by their _compounded Forces_ pass through the same _Points_, as it\r\nwould do, were the two _Motions divided_ and acted _successively_. As\r\nfor Instance, Suppose a _Body_ moved in the Line GF, (_Fig. 1. Tab. 5._)\r\nfrom G to R, and there stopping, by another _Impulse_, suppose it moved\r\nin a _Space_ of _Time_ equal to the former, from R towards K, to V. I\r\nsay, the _Body_ shall pass through the Point to V, though these two\r\n_several Forces_ acted both in the _same time_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prop._ V. The _Motion_ of all _Projects_ is in the _Curve_ of a\r\n_Parabola_: Let the _Line_ GRF (in _Fig._ 1.) be the _Line_ in which the\r\n_Project_ is directed, and in which by the first _Axiom_ it would move\r\nequal _Spaces_ in equal _Times_, were it not deflected downwards by the\r\nForce of _Gravity_. Let GB be the _Horizontal Line_, and GC a\r\n_Perpendicular_ thereto. Then the _Line_ GRF being divided into equal\r\nParts, answering to equal _Spaces_ of _Time_, let the _Descents_ of the\r\n_Project_ be laid down in _Lines parallel_ to GC, proportioned as the\r\n_Squares_ of the _Lines_ GS, GR, GL, GF, or as the _Squares_ of the\r\n_Times_, from S to T, from R to V, from L to X, and from F to B, and\r\ndraw the _Lines_ TH, VD, XY, BC parallel to GF; I say, the Points T, V,\r\nX, B, are Points in the _Curve_ described by the _Project_, and that\r\nthat _Curve_ is a _Parabola_. By the second _Axiom_, they are Points in\r\nthe _Curve_; and the Parts of the _Descent_ GH, GD, GY, GC, = to ST, RV,\r\nLX, FB, being as the _Squares_ of the _Times_ (by the _Second\r\nProposition_) that is, as the _Squares_ of the _Ordinates_, HT, DU, YX,\r\nBC, equal to GS, GR, GL, GF, the _Spaces_ measured in those Times; and\r\nthere being no other _Curve_ but the _Parabola_, whose Parts of the\r\n_Diameter_ are as the _Squares_ of the _Ordinates_, it follows that the\r\n_Curve_ describ'd by a _Project_, can be no other than a _Parabola_: And\r\nsaying, as RU the _Descent_ in any _time_, to GR or UD the _direct\r\nMotion_ in the same _time_, so is UD to a _third_ proportional; that\r\n_third_ will be the _Line_ call'd by all Writers of _Conicks_, the\r\n_Parameter_ of the _Parabola_ to the _Diameter_ GC, which is always the\r\nsame in _Projects_ cast with the same _Velocity_: And the _Velocity_\r\nbeing defined by the Number of _Feet_ moved in a _Second_ of Time, the\r\n_Parameter_ will be found by dividing the _Square_ of the _Velocity_, by\r\n16 _Feet_, 1 _Inch_, the _Fall_ of a _Body_ in the same _Time_.\r\n\r\n_Lemma._\r\n\r\nThe _Sine_ of the double of any _Arch_, is equal to twice the _Sine_ of\r\nthat _Arch_ into its _Co-sine_, divided by _Radius_; and the _versed\r\nSine_ of the _double_ of any _Arch_ is equal to twice the _Square_ of\r\nthe _Sine_ thereof divided by _Radius_.\r\n\r\nLet the _Arch_ BC (in _Fig. 2. Tab. 5._) be double the _Arch_ BF, and A\r\nthe _Center_; draw the _Radii_ AB, AF, AC, and the _Chord_ BDC, and let\r\nfall BE perpendicular to AC, and the _Angle_ EBC, will be equal to the\r\n_Angle_ ABD, and the _Triangle_ BCE, will be like to the _Triangle_ BDA;\r\nwherefore it will be as AB to AD, so BC or twice BD, to BE; that is, as\r\n_Radius_ to _Co-sine_, so twice _Sine_ to _Sine_ of the double _Arch_.\r\nAnd as AB to BD, so twice BD or BC to EC, that is, as _Radius_ to\r\n_Sine_, so twice that _Sine_, to the _Versed Sine_ of the double _Arch_;\r\nwhich two _Analogies_ resolved into _Equations_, are the _Propositions_\r\ncontained in the _Lemma_ to be proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prop._ VI. The _Horizontal_ Distances of _Projections_ made with the\r\nsame _Velocity_, at several _Elevations_ of the _Line_ of Direction, are\r\nas the _Sines_ of the doubled _Angles_ of _Elevation_.\r\n\r\nLet GB (_Fig._ 1) the _Horizontal_ Distance be = _z_, the _Sine_ of the\r\n_Angle_ of _Elevation_, FGB, be = _s_, its _Co-sine_ = _c_, _Radius_ =\r\n_r_, and the _Parameter_ = _p_. It will be as _c_ to _s_; so _z_ to\r\n_sz_/_c_ = FB = GC, and by reason of the _Parabola_ _psz_/_c_ = to the\r\n_Square_ of CB, or GF; Now as _c_ to _r_, so is _z_ to _zr_/_c_ = GF,\r\nand its _Square_ _zzrr_/_cc_ will be therefore = to _psz_/_c_: Which\r\n_Equation_ reduced will be _psc_/_rr_ = _z_. But by the former _Lemma_\r\n2_sc_/_r_ is equal to the _Sine_ of the double _Angle_, whereof _s_ is\r\nthe _Sine_: Wherefore 'twill be as _Radius_ to _Sine_ of double the\r\n_Angle_ FGB, so is half the _Parameter_, to the _Horizontal Range_ or\r\n_Distance_ sought; and at the several _Elevations_, the _Ranges_ are as\r\nthe _Sines_ of the double _Angles_ of _Elevation_, _Q. E. D._\r\n\r\n_Corollary._\r\n\r\nHence it follows, that half the _Parameter_ is the greatest _Randon_,\r\nand that that happens at the _Elevation_ of 45 Degrees, the _Sine_ of\r\nwhose double is _Radius_. Likewise that the _Ranges_ equally distant\r\nabove and below 45 are equal, as are the _Sines_ of all double _Arches_,\r\nto the _Sines_ of their doubled _Complements_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prop._ VII. The _Altitudes_ of _Projections_ made with the same\r\n_Velocity_, at several _Elevations_, are as the _versed Sines_ of the\r\ndoubled _Angles_ of _Elevation_: As _c_ is to _s_; so is _psc/rr_ = GB\r\nto _pss/rr_ = BF: and UK = RU = BF/4, the _Altitude_ of the _Projection_\r\n= _psc/4rr_. Now by the foregoing _Lemma_ _2ss/r_ = to the _versed Sine_\r\nof the double _Angle_, and therefore it will be as _Radius_, to _versed\r\nSine_ of double the _Angle_ FGB, so an 8th of the _Parameter_ to the\r\nheight of the _Projection_ VK; and so these heights at several\r\n_Elevations_, are as the said _versed Sines_, _Q. E. D._\r\n\r\n_Corollary._\r\n\r\nFrom hence it is plain, that the greatest _Altitude_ of the\r\nperpendicular _Projection_ is a 4th of _Parameter_, or half the greatest\r\n_Horizontal Range_; the _versed Sine_ of 180 Degrees being = _2r_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prop._ VIII. The _Lines_ GF, or Times of the Flight of a _Project_ cast\r\nwith the same Degree of _Velocity_ at different _Elevations_, are as the\r\n_Sines_ of the _Elevations_.\r\n\r\nAs _c_ is to _r_; so is _psc/rr_ = GB by the 6 Prop. to _ps/r_ GF; that\r\nis, as _Radius_ to _Sine_ of _Elevation_, so the _Parameter_ to the\r\n_Line_ GF; so the _Lines_ GF are as the _Sines_ of _Elevation_, and the\r\n_Times_ are proportional to those _Lines_; wherefore the _Times_ are as\r\nthe _Sines_ of _Elevation_: _Ergo constat propositio_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prop._ IX. Problem. A _Projection_ being made as you please, having the\r\nDistance and Altitude, or Descent, of an Object, through which the\r\nProject passes, together with the _Angle_ of _Elevation_ of the _Line_\r\nof _Direction_; to find the _Parameter_ and _Velocity_, that is (in\r\n_Fig._ 1.) having the _Angle_ FGB, GM, and MX.\r\n\r\n_Solution._ As _Radius_ to _Secant_ of FGB, so GM the _Distance_ given\r\nto GL; and as _Radius_ to _Tangent_ of FGB, so GM to LM. Then LM - MX in\r\n_Heights_, or + MX in _Descents_; or else MX - ML, if the _Direction_ be\r\nbelow the _Horizontal Line_, is the _Fall_ in the _Time_ that the direct\r\n_Impulse_ given in G would have carried the Project from G to L = LX =\r\nGY; then by Reason of the _Parabola_, as LX or GY, is to GL or YX, so is\r\nGL to the _Parameter_ sought. To find the _Velocity_ of the _Impulse_:\r\nby Prop. 2, and 4, find the Time in Seconds that a Body would fall the\r\nSpace LX; and by that dividing the Line GL, the _Quote_ will be the\r\n_Velocity_, or Space moved in a Second sought, which is always a mean\r\nProportional between the _Parameter_, and 16 Feet, 1 Inch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prop_. X. Problem 2. Having the _Parameter_, Horizontal Distance, and\r\nHeight or Descent of an _Object_, to find the Elevations of the Line of\r\nDirection necessary to hit the given _Object_; that is, having GM, MX,\r\nand the greatest _Randon_ equal to half the _Parameter_; to find the\r\n_Angles_ FGB.\r\n\r\nLet the _Tangent_ of the _Angle_ sought be = _t_, the _Horizontal\r\nDistance_ GM = _b_, the Altitude of the _Object_ MX = _h_, the\r\n_Parameter_ = _p_, and _Radius_ = _r_, and it will be,\r\n\r\n As _r_ to _t_, so _b_ to _tb/r_ = ML and\r\n _tb/r ∓ h_ {in ascents|in descents} = LX, and\r\n _ptb/r ∓ ph_ = GL _quad._ = XY _quad. ratione Parabolæ_; but\r\n _bb ∓ ttbb/rr_ = GL _quad._ 47. 1. _Euclid_. Wherefore\r\n _ptb/r ∓ ph_ = _bb ∓ ttbb/rr_ which Equation transposed, is\r\n _ttbb/rr_ = _ptb/r ∓ ph - bb_, divided by _bb_ is\r\n _tt/rr_ = _pt/br ∓ ph/bb_ - 1.\r\n\r\nthis Equation shews the Question to have 2 Answers, and the Roots\r\nthereof are\r\n\r\n _t/r_ = _p/2h_ ∓ √((_pp ∓ 4ph_)/_4bb_) - 1;\r\n\r\nfrom which I derive the following Rule.\r\n\r\nDivide half the _Parameter_ by the Horizontal distance, and keep the\r\nQuote; _viz._ _p/2b_ then say, as _square_ of the _distance_ given to\r\nthe half _Parameter_, so half _Parameter_ ∓ double {height|descent} to\r\nthe _square_ of a _Secant_ = (_pp ∓ 4ph_)/(_4bb_). The _Tangent_\r\nanswering to that _Secant_, will be\r\n\r\n √((_pp ∓ 4ph_)/4_bb_) - 1 or Square of Radius,\r\n\r\nso then the sum and difference of the afore-found _Quote_, and this\r\n_Tangent_ will be the Roots of the _Equation_, and the _Tangents_ of the\r\n_Elevations_ sought.\r\n\r\nNote here, that in _Descents_, if the _Tangent_ exceed the _Quote_, as\r\nit does when _ph_ is more than _bb_, the _direction_ of the lower\r\n_Elevation_ will be below the _Horizon_, and if _ph_ = _bb_, it must be\r\ndirected _Horizontal_, and the _Tangent_ of the upper _Elevation_ will\r\nbe _pr/b_: Note likewise, that if _4bb + 4ph_ in _Ascents_, or _4bb -\r\n4ph_ in _Descents_, be equal to _pp_, there is but one _Elevation_ that\r\ncan hit the _Object_, and its _Tangent_ is _pr/2b_. And if _4bb + 4ph_\r\nin _Ascents_, or _4bb - 4ph_ in _descents_, do exceed _pp_, the _Object_\r\nis without the reach of a _Project_ cast with that _Velocity_, and so\r\nthe thing impossible.\r\n\r\nFrom this _Equation_ _4bb ∓ 4ph_ = _pp_ are determined the utmost\r\nlimits of the reach of any _Project_, and the Figure assigned, wherein\r\nare all the _heights_ upon each _Horizontal distance_ beyond which it\r\ncannot pass; for by reduction of that _Equation_, _h_ will be found =\r\n_¼p_ - _bb/p_ in _heights_, and _bb/p_ - _¼p_ in _descents_; from\r\nwhence it follows, that all the Points _h_ are in the _Curve_ of the\r\n_Parabola_, whose _Focus_ is the Point from whence the _Project_ is\r\ncast, and whose _Latus rectum_, or _Parameter ad Axem_ is = _p_.\r\nLikewise from the same _Equation_ may the least _Parameter_ or\r\n_Velocity_ be found capable to reach the _Object_ proposed; for _bb_ =\r\n_¼pp_ ∓ _ph_ being reduced, _½p_ will be = √(_bb + hh_) ± _h_\r\n{in ascents|in descents} which is the _Horizontal Range_ at 45 degrees,\r\nof a Project cast with the least Velocity that would just reach the\r\n_Object_, and the _Elevation_ requisite will be easily had; for dividing\r\nthe so found _Semi-parameter_ by the _Horizontal distance_ given _b_,\r\nthe _Quote_ into _Radius_ will be the _Tangent_ of the _Elevation_\r\nsought. This Rule may be of good use to all _Bombardiers_ and _Gunners_,\r\nnot only that they may use no more Powder than is necessary, to cast\r\ntheir _Bombs_ into the place assigned, but that they may shoot with much\r\nmore certainty, for that a small Error committed in the _Elevation_ of\r\nthe _Piece_, will produce no sensible Difference in the fall of the\r\nShot: For which Reasons the _French_ Engineers in their late Sieges have\r\nused Mortar-pieces inclin'd constantly to the _Elevation_ of 45,\r\nproportioning their Charge of Pouder according to the distance of the\r\n_Object_ they intend to strike on the Horizon.\r\n\r\nAnd this is all that need to be said concerning this _Problem_ of\r\nshooting upon _Heights_ and _Descents_. But if a _Geometrical_\r\nConstruction thereof be required; I think I have one that is as easy as\r\ncan be expected, which I deduce from the foregoing _Analytical\r\nSolution_, _viz._\r\n\r\n _t/r_ = _p/2b_ ± √((_¼pp ± ph - bb_)/_bb_),\r\n\r\nand 'tis this, having made the right Angle GDF, (_Tab. 5. Fig. 3._) make\r\nDF = _½p_, or greatest Range, and GD = _b_ the Horizontal Distance,\r\nand DB = _h_ the perpendicular heighth of the Object; to be laid upwards\r\nfrom D, if the Object be above the Horizon, or downwards if below it.\r\nParallel to GD draw FA, and make it equal to GB the Hypothenusal\r\nDistance of the Object; and with the Center A and Radius FB = _½p ±\r\nh_, sweep an Arch, which shall if the thing be possible, intersect the\r\nindeterminate Perpendicular DF in two Points K and L, to which draw the\r\nLines, GL, GK; I say, the Angles DGK, DGL, are the Elevations requisite\r\nto strike the Object B.\r\n\r\n_Demonstration._ The Square of FK or FL, is equal to FB_q_ - GB_q_: or\r\n(_½p ± h_)² - _bb_ - _hh_ or _¼pp ± ph - bb_, and therefore\r\n√(_¼pp ± ph - bb_) is = FK = FL, and by Consequence DK, DL =\r\n_½p_ ± √(_½pp ± ph - bb_). And as DG: DK and DL :: Radius:\r\nTangents sought, which coincides with our Algebraical Expression thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prop._ XI. To determine the Force or _Velocity_ of a _Project_, in\r\nevery Point of the _Curve_ it describes.\r\n\r\nTo do this we need no other _Præcognita_, but only the third\r\nProposition, _viz._ That the _Velocity_ of _falling Bodies_, is double\r\nto that which in the same time, would have described the Space _fallen_\r\nby an equable Motion: For the _Velocity_ of a Project, is compounded of\r\nthe constant equal _Velocity_ of the impressed Motion, and the\r\n_Velocity_ of the _Fall_, under a given _Angle_, _viz._ the Complement\r\nof the _Elevation_: For Instance, in _Fig. 2._ in the time wherein a\r\nProject would move from G to L, it descends from L to X, and by the\r\nthird _Proposition_ has acquired a _Velocity_, which in that time would\r\nhave carried it by an equable Motion from L to Z, or twice the Descent\r\nLX; and drawing the Line GZ, I say, the _Velocity_ in the Point X,\r\ncompounded of the _Velocities_ GL and LZ under the Angle GLZ, is to the\r\n_Velocity_ impress'd in the Point G, as GZ is to GL; this follows from\r\nour second _Axiom_, and by the 20 and 21 _Prop. lib. 1. conic.\r\nMidorgii_, XO parallel and equal to GZ shall touch the _Parabola_ in the\r\nPoint X. So that the _Velocities_ in the several Points, are as the\r\nlengths of the _Tangents_ to the _Parabola_ in those Points, intercepted\r\nbetween any two _Diameters_: And these again are as the _Secants_ of the\r\n_Angles_, which those _Tangents_ continued make with the _Horizontal_\r\nLine GB. From what is here laid down, may the comparative Force of a\r\n_Shot_ in any two Points of the _Curve_, be either _Geometrically_ or\r\n_Arithmetically_ discover'd.\r\n\r\n_Corollary._\r\n\r\nFrom hence it follows, that the force of a Shot is always least at U, or\r\nthe _Vertex_ of the _Parabola_, and that at equal distances therefrom,\r\nas at T and X, G and B its force is always equal, and that the least\r\nforce in U is to that in G and B, as _Radius_ to the Secant of the\r\n_Angle_ of _Elevation_ FGB.\r\n\r\nThese _Propositions_ considered, there is no question relating to\r\n_Projects_, which, by the help of them, may not easily be Solved; and\r\ntho' it be true that most of them are to be met withal, in _Galileus_,\r\n_Torricellius_ and others, who have taken them from those Authors, yet\r\ntheir Books being Foreign, and not easy to come by, and their\r\n_Demonstrations_ long and difficult, I thought it not amiss to give the\r\nwhole _Doctrine_ here in _English_, with such short _Analytical_ Proof\r\nof my own, as might be sufficient to evince their Truth.\r\n\r\nThe Tenth _Proposition_ contains a _Problem_, untouch'd by _Torricellius_,\r\nwhich is of the greatest use in _Gunnery_, and for the sake of which\r\nthis _Discourse_ was principally intended: It was first Solved by Mr.\r\n_Anderson_, in his Book of the Genuine Use and Effects of the _Gun_,\r\nPrinted in the Year 1674; but his Solution required so much Calculation,\r\nthat it put me upon search, whether it might not be done more easily,\r\nand thereupon in the Year 1678 I found out the Rule I now Publish, and\r\nfrom it the _Geometrical_ Construction: Since which time there has a\r\nlarge _Treatise_ of this Subject, Intituled, _L'Art dejetter les\r\nBombes_, been Published by _Monsieur Blondel_, wherein he gives the\r\nSolutions of this _Problem_ by _Messieurs Buot_, _Romer_ and _de la\r\nHire_: But none of them being the same with Mine, or, in my Opinion,\r\nmore easy, and most of them more Operose, and besides mine finding the\r\n_Tangent_, which generally determines the _Angle_ better than its\r\n_Sine_, I thought my self obliged to Print it for the use of all such,\r\nas desire to be informed in the _Mathematical_ part of the Art of\r\n_Gunnery_.\r\n\r\nNow these Rules were rigidly true, were it not, as I said before, for\r\nthe Opposition of the Medium, whereby not only the direct imprest Motion\r\nis continually retarded, but likewise the increase of the _Velocity_ of\r\nthe _Fall_, so that the Spaces described thereby, are not exactly as the\r\nSquares of the Times: But what this Opposition of the _Air_ is, against\r\nseveral _Velocities_, _Bulks_, and _Weights_, is not so easie to\r\ndetermine. 'Tis certain that the weight of _Air_ to that of _Water_, is\r\nnearly as 1 to 800, whence the weight thereof, to that of any _Project_\r\nis given; 'tis very likely, that to the same _Velocity_ and _Magnitude_,\r\nbut of different Matter, the _Opposition_ should be _reciprocally_ as\r\nthe weights of the Shot; as likewise that to Shot of the same _Velocity_\r\nand Matter, but of different _Sizes_, it should be as the _Diameters\r\nreciprocally_: Whence generally the _Opposition_ to Shot with the same\r\n_Velocity_, but of differing _Diameters_, and _Materials_, should be as\r\ntheir _Specifick Gravities_ into their _Diameters reciprocally_; but\r\nwhether the _Opposition_, to differing _Velocities_ of the same Shot, be\r\nas the _Squares_ of those _Velocities_, or as the _Velocities_\r\nthemselves, or otherwise, is yet a harder Question. However it be, 'tis\r\ncertain, that in large Shot of _Metal_, whose weight many Thousand times\r\nsurpasses that of the _Air_, and whose force is very great, in\r\nproportion to the _Surface_ wherewith they press thereon; this\r\n_Opposition_ is scarce discernable; For by several _Experiments_ made\r\nwith all Care and Circumspection with a _Mortarpiece_, Extraordinary\r\nwell fix'd to the Earth on purpose, which carried a solid Brass Shot of\r\nfour Inches and a half _Diameter_, and of about fourteen Pound Weight,\r\nthe _Ranges_ above and below forty five _Degrees_ were found nearly\r\nequal; if there were any difference, the under _Ranges_ went rather the\r\nfarthest, but those differences were usually less than the Errors\r\ncommitted in ordinary Practice, by the unequal Goodness and Dryness of\r\nthe same sort of Powder, by the Unfitness of the Shot to the Bore, and\r\nby the Loosness of the Carriage.\r\n\r\nIn a smaller Brass-Shot of about an Inch and half Diameter, cast by a\r\nCross-Bow which ranged it, at most about four Hundred Foot, the Force\r\nbeing much more equal than in the Mortarpiece, this difference was found\r\nmore Curiously: and Constantly and most Evidently, the under Ranges\r\nout-went the upper. From which Trials I conclude, that although in small\r\nand light Shot, the Opposition of the Air, ought and must be accounted\r\nfor; yet in Shooting of great and weighty Bombs, there need be very\r\nlittle or no allowance made; and so these Rules may be put in practice\r\nto all Intents and Purposes, as if this Impediment were absolutely\r\nremov'd.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Proposition of general Use in the Art of Gunnery, shewing the Rule of\r\nlaying a Mortar to pass, in order to strike an Object above or below the\r\nHorizon._\r\n\r\nIt was formerly the Opinion of those concerned in Artillery, that there\r\nwas a certain requisite of Powder for each Gun, and that in Mortars,\r\nwhere the distance was to be varied, it must be done by giving a greater\r\nor lesser Elevation to the Piece. But now our later Experience has\r\ntaught us that the same thing may be more certainly and readily\r\nperformed by increasing and diminishing the quantity of Powder, whether\r\nregard be had to the Execution to be done, or to the Charge of doing it.\r\nFor when Bombs are discharged with great Elevations of the Mortar, they\r\nfall too Perpendicular, and bury themselves too deep in the Ground, to\r\ndo all that damage they might, if they came more Oblique, and broke upon\r\nor near the Surface of the Earth; which is a thing acknowledg'd by the\r\nBesieged in all Towns, who unpave their Streets, to let the Bombs bury\r\nthemselves, and thereby stifle the force of their Splinters. A Second\r\nConvenience is, that at the extream Elevation, the Gunner is not obliged\r\nto be so curious in the direction of his Piece, but it will suffice to\r\nbe within a Degree or two of the Truth; whereas in the other Method of\r\nShooting he ought to be very curious. But a Third, and no less\r\nconsiderable Advantage is, in the saving the Prince's Powder, which in\r\nso great and so numerous Discharges, as we have lately seen, must needs\r\namount to a considerable Value. And for Sea-Mortars, it is scarce\r\npracticable otherwise to use them, where the agitation of the Sea\r\ncontinually changes the Direction of the Mortar, and would render the\r\nShot very uncertain, were it not that they are placed about 45 Degrees\r\nElevation, where several Degrees above or under, make very little\r\ndifference in the Effect.\r\n\r\nIn the precedent Discourse, I considered all the Propositions relating\r\nto the Motion of Projectiles, and gave a Solution to this Problem;\r\n_viz._ _To hit an Object above or below the Horizontal Line with the\r\ngreatest Certainty and least Force._ That is, that the Horizontal\r\ndistance of the Object being put = _b_, and the Perpendicular Heighth =\r\n_b_, the Charge requisite to strike the Object with the greatest\r\nAdvantage, was that which with an Elevation of 45° would cast the Shot\r\non the Horizontal Line, to the distance of √(_bb +hh_), when the\r\nObject was above the Horizon; or if it were below it, the Charge must be\r\nlesser, so as to reach on the Horizon, at 45° Elevation, no greater a\r\nDistance than √(_bb + hh_) - _h_; that is, in the one Case, the Sum\r\nof the Hypothenusal Distance of the Object from the Gun, and the\r\nPerpendicular Heighth thereof above the Gun; and in the other Case, when\r\nthe Object is below the Horizon, the difference of the same _per_ 47. I\r\n_Eucl._ And I then shew'd how to find the Elevation proper for the Gun\r\nso charged, _viz._ As the Horizontal Distance of the Object, to the Sum\r\nor Difference of the Hypothenusal Distance and Perpendicular Height: So\r\nRadius to the Tangent of the Elevation sought. But I was not at that\r\ntime aware that the aforesaid Elevation did constantly bisect the Angle\r\nbetween the Perpendicular and the Object, as is demonstrated from the\r\nDifference and Sum of the _Tangent_ and _Secant_ of any Arch being\r\nalways equal to the _Tangent_ and _Cotangent_ of the half Complement\r\nthereof to a Quadrant. Having discovered this, I think nothing can be\r\nmore compendious, or bids fairer to compleat the Art of Gunnery, it\r\nbeing as easie to shoot with a Mortar at any Object on demand, as if it\r\nwere on the Level; neither is there need of any Computation, but only\r\nsimply laying the Gun to pass, in the middle Line between the Zenith and\r\nthe Object, and giving it its due Charge. Nor is there any great need of\r\nInstruments for this purpose: For if the Muzzle of the Mortar be turned\r\ntruly Square to the Bore of the Piece, as it usually is or ought to be,\r\na piece of Looking-glass Plate applied parallel to the Muzzle, will by\r\nits Reflection give the true Position of the Piece, the Bombardeer\r\nhaving no more to do, but to look perpendicularly down on the\r\nLooking-glass, along a small Thread with a Plumbet, and to raise or\r\ndepress the Elevation of the Piece, till the Object appear reflected on\r\nthe same Point of the _Speculum_, on which the Plumbet falls; for the\r\nAngle of Incidence and Reflection being equal, in this Case a Line at\r\nRight Angles to the _Speculum_, as is the _Axis_ of the Chase of the\r\nPiece, will bisect the Angle between the Perpendicular and the Object,\r\naccording as our Proposition requires. So that it only remains by good\r\nand valid Experiments to be assured of the Force of Gunpowder, how to\r\nmake and conserve it equal, and to know the Effect thereof in each\r\nPiece; that is, how far differing Charges will cast the same Shot out of\r\nit; which may most conveniently be engraven on the outside thereof, as a\r\nstanding Direction to all Gunners, who shall from thence forward have\r\noccasion to use that Piece: And were this Matter well ascertained, it\r\nmight be worth the while to make all Mortars of the like Diameter as\r\nnear as may he, alike in length of Chase, Weight, Chamber, and all other\r\nCircumstances.\r\n\r\nThis Discovery that the utmost Range on an inclined Plane, is, when the\r\n_Axis_ of the Piece makes equal Angles with the Perpendicular and the\r\nObject; compared with what I have demonstrated of the same Problem in\r\nthe aforesaid Discourse does lead to and discover two very ready\r\nTheorems; the one, to find the greatest Horizontal Range at 45°\r\nElevation, by any Shot made upon any inclined Plane, with any Elevation\r\nof the Piece whatsoever: And the other to find the Elevations proper to\r\nstrike a given Object, with any Force greater than what suffices to\r\nreach it with the aforesaid middle Elevation. Both which being performed\r\nby one single Proportion, may be very serviceable to such as are\r\nconcerned in the Practice of Gunnery, but are unwilling to trouble\r\nthemselves with tedious and difficult Rules. The two Propositions are\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PROP. I._\r\n\r\nA Shot being made on an inclined Plane, having the Horizontal Distance\r\nof the Object it strikes, with the Elevation of the Piece, and the Angle\r\nat the Gun between the Object and the Perpendicular; to find the\r\ngreatest Horizontal Range of that Piece, laden with the same Charge;\r\nthat is, half the _Latus rectum_ of all the _Parabolæ_ made with the\r\nsame _Impetus_.\r\n\r\n_RULE._\r\n\r\nTake half the Distance of the Object from the _Nadir_, and take the\r\nDifference of the given Elevation from that half; the Versed Sine of\r\ntwice that Difference subtract from the Versed Sine of the Distance of\r\nthe Object from the _Zenith_: Then shall the Difference of those Versed\r\nSines be to the Sine of the Distance of the Object from the _Zenith_, as\r\nthe Horizontal Distance of the Object strook, to the greatest Horizontal\r\nRange at 45°.\r\n\r\n_PROP. II._\r\n\r\nHaving the greatest Horizontal Range of a Gun, the Horizontal Distance\r\nand Angle of Inclination of an Object to the Perpendicular, to find the\r\ntwo Elevations necessary to strike that Object.\r\n\r\n_RULE._\r\n\r\nHalve the Distance of the Object from the _Nadir_; this half is always\r\nequal to the half Sum of the two Elevations we seek. Then say, _As the\r\ngreatest Horizontal Range is to the Horizontal Distance of the Object:\r\nSo is the Sine of the Angle of Inclination or Distance of the Object\r\nfrom the Perpendicular, to a fourth Proportional; which fourth being\r\nsubtracted from the Versed Sine of the Distance of the Object from the\r\n_Zenith_, leaves the Versed Sine of the Difference of the Elevations\r\nsought; which Elevations are therefore had by adding and subtracting the\r\nhalf Difference to and from the aforesaid half Sum._\r\n\r\nI shall not need to speak of the Facility of these Solutions, I shall\r\nonly observe that they are both General, without Exception or Caution,\r\nand derived from the Knowledge that these two Elevations are equidistant\r\nabove and below the Line, bisecting the Angle between the Object and the\r\n_Zenith_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A Discourse concerning the Measure of the Airs Resistance to Bodies\r\n   moved in it. By the Learned _John Wallis_, S. T. D. and R. S. S._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. That the Air (and the like of any other _Medium_) doth considerably\r\ngive Resistance to Bodies moved in it; and doth thereby abate their\r\nCelerity and Force; is generally admitted. And Experience doth attest\r\nit: For otherwise, a Cannon Bullet projected Horizontally, should\r\n(supposing the Celerity and Force undiminished) strike as hard against a\r\nPerpendicular Wall, erected at a great distance, as near at hand; which\r\nwe find it doth not.\r\n\r\n2. But at what Rate, or in what Proportion, such Resistance is; and\r\n(consequently, at what Rate the Celerity and Force is continually\r\ndiminished) seems not to have been so well examined. Whence it is, that\r\nthe Motion of a Project (secluding this Consideration) is commonly\r\nreputed to describe a Parabolick Line; as arising from an Uniform or\r\nequal Celerity in the Line of Projection, and a Celerity uniformly\r\naccelerated in the Line of Descent; which two so compounded, do create a\r\nParabola.\r\n\r\n3. In order to the Computation hereof, I first premise this _Lemma_, (as\r\nthe most rational that doth occur for my first footing,) That (supposing\r\nother things equal) the Resistance is proportional to the Celerity. For\r\nin a double Celerity, there is to be removed (in the same time) twice as\r\nmuch Air, (which is a double Impediment) in a treble, thrice as much;\r\nand so in other Proportions.\r\n\r\n4. Suppose we then the Force impressed (and consequently the Celerity,\r\nif there were no Resistance) as 1; the Resistance as _r_. (which must be\r\nless than the Force, or else the Force would not prevail over the\r\nImpediment, to create a Motion.) And therefore the effective Force at a\r\nfirst Moment, is to be reputed as 1 - _r_: That is, so much as the Force\r\nimpressed, is more than the Impediment or Resistance.\r\n\r\n5. Be it as 1 - _r_ to 1; so one to _m_. (which _m_ is therefore greater\r\nthan 1.)\r\n\r\n6. And therefore the effective Force (and consequently the Celerity) as\r\nto a first Moment, is to be 1/_m_ of what it would be, had there been no\r\nResistance.\r\n\r\n7. This 1/_m_ is also the remaining Force after such first Moment; and\r\nthis remaining Force is (for the same Reason) to be proportionally\r\nabated as to a second Moment; that is, we are to take 1/_m_ thereof,\r\nthat is 1/_mm_ of the impressed Force. And for a third Moment (at equal\r\ndistance of time) 1/_mmm_; for a fourth 1/_m_⁴; and so onward\r\ninfinitely.\r\n\r\n8. Because the length dispatched (in equal times) is proportional to the\r\nCelerities; the Lines of Motion (answering to those equal Times) are to\r\nbe as 1/_m_, 1/_m_², 1/_m_³, 1/_m_⁴, _&c._ of what they would have\r\nbeen, in the same Times, had there been no Resistance.\r\n\r\n9. This therefore is a Geometrical Progression; and (because of _m_\r\ngreater than 1) continually decreasing.\r\n\r\n10. This decreasing Progression infinitely continued (determining in the\r\nsame Point of Rest, where the Motion is supposed to expire) is yet of a\r\nfinite Magnitude; and equal to 1/(_m_ - 1), of what it would have been\r\nin so much Time, if there had been no Resistance. As is demonstrated in\r\nmy Algebra, _Chap._ 95. _Prop._ 8. For (as I have elsewhere\r\ndemonstrated) the Sum or Aggregate of a Geometrical Progression is (_VR\r\n- A_)/(_R_ - 1) (supposing _V_ the greatest Term, _A_ the least, and _R_\r\nthe common Multiplier.) That is _VR_/(_R_ - 1) - _A_/(_R_ - 1). Now in\r\nthe present Case, (supposing the Progression infinitely continued) the\r\nleast Term _A_, becomes infinitely small, or = 0. And consequently\r\n_A_/(_R_ - 1) doth also vanish, and thereby the Aggregate becomes =\r\n_VR_/(_R_ - 1). That is (as will appear by dividing _VR_ by _R_ - 1;) _V\r\n+ V/R + V/RR + V/R³ + &c._ = _VR_/(_R_ - 1);[14] (supposing the\r\nProgression to begin at _V_ = 1.) That is (dividing all by _R_, that so\r\nthe Progression may begin at _V/R_ = 1/_m_:) _V_/(_R_ - 1) = _V/R + V/RR\r\n+ V/R³ + &c._,  That is, in our present Case (because of _V_ = 1, &\r\n_R_ = _m_:) 1/_m_ + 1/_mm_ + 1/_m_³ &c. = 1/(_m_ - 1). That is,\r\n(putting _n_ = _m_ - 1) 1/_n_ of what it would have been if there had\r\nbeen no Resistance.\r\n\r\n11. This infinite Progression is fitly expressed by an Ordinate in the\r\nExterior Hyperbola, parallel to one of the Asymptotes; and the several\r\nMembers of that, by the several Members of this, cut in continual\r\nProportion. As is there demonstrated at _Prop._ 15. For let _SH_,\r\n(_vid._ Fig. 4. Tab. 5.) be an Hyperbola between the Asymptotes _AB_,\r\n_AF_: And let the Ordinate _DH_ (in the Exterior Hyperbola, parallel to\r\n_AF_,) represent the impressed Force undiminished; or the Line to be\r\ndescribed in such time, by a Celerity answerable to such undiminished\r\nForce. And let _BS_ (a like Ordinate) be 1/_m_ thereof; which therefore,\r\nbeing less than _DH_ (as being equal to a Part of it) will be farther\r\nthan it from _AF_. In _AB_ (which I put = 1) let _Bd_ be such a Part\r\nthereof, as is _BS_ of _DH_. Now because (as is, well known) all the\r\ninscribed Parallelograms, in the Exterior Hyperbola, _AS_, _AH_, _&c._\r\nare equal; and therefore their sides reciprocal: Therefore as _Ad_ = 1 -\r\n1/_m_ (supposing _Bd_ to be taken, from _B_ towards _A_,) to _AB_ = 1,\r\nor as _m_ - 1 to _m_: so is _BS_ = (1/_m_)_DH_, to _dh_, which is\r\ntherefore equal to 1/(_m_ - 1) of _DH_; that is (as will appear by\r\ndividing 1, by _m_ - 1,) to 1/_m_ + 1/_mm_ + 1/_m_³, _&c._ of _DH_.[15]\r\n\r\nOr if _Bd_ be taken beyond _B_; then as _Ad_ = 1 + 1/_m_ to _AB_ = 1, or\r\nas _m_ + 1 to _m_, so is (1/_m_)_DH_ to _dh_, which is therefore equal\r\nto 1/(_m_ + 1)DH; that is (as will appear by like dividing of 1 by _m_ +\r\n1;) = to 1/_m_ - 1/_mm_ + 1/_m_³ - _&c._ of _DH_.\r\n\r\n12. Let such ordinate _dh_, or (equal to it in the Asymptote) _AF_, be\r\nso divided in _L_, _M_, _N_, _&c._ (by Perpendiculars cutting the\r\nHyperbola in _l_, _m_, _n_, _&c._) as that _FL_, _LM_, _MN_, be as\r\n1/_m_, 1/_mm_, 1/_m_³, _&c._ That is, so continually decreasing as that\r\neach Antecedent be to its Consequent, as 1 to 1/_m_, or as _m_ to 1. See\r\n_Fig. 5. Tab. 5._\r\n\r\n13. This is done by taking _AF_, _AL_, _AN_, _&c._ in such proportion.\r\nFor, of continual Proportionals, the Differences are also continually\r\nproportional, and in the same proportion. For let _A_, _B_, _C_, _D_,\r\n_&c._ be such Proportionals, and their Differences _a_, _b_, _c_, _&c._\r\nThat is, _A_ - _B_ = _a_, _B_ - _C_ = _b_, _C_ - _D_ = _c_, _&c._\r\n\r\n Then, because A, B, C, D, _&c._ are in continual proportion,\r\n That is, A. B :: B. C :: C. D :: _&c._\r\n And dividing (A - B). B :: (B - C). C :: (C - D). D :: _&c._\r\n That is, _a_. B :: _b_. C :: _d_. D :: _&c._\r\n And alternly _a. b. c._ _&c._ :: B. C. D. _&c._ :: A. B. C. _&c._\r\n That is, in continual proportion as A to B, or as _m_ to 1.\r\n\r\n14. This being done; the Hyperbolick Spaces _Fl_, _Lm_, _Mn_, &c. are\r\nequal. As is demonstrated by _Gregory San-Vincent_; and as such is\r\ncommonly admitted.\r\n\r\n15. So that _Fl_, _Lm_, _Mn_, _&c._ may fitly represent equal Times, in\r\nwhich are dispatched unequal Lengths, represented by _FL_, _LM_, _MN_,\r\n_&c._\r\n\r\n16. And because they are in Number infinite (though equal to a finite\r\nMagnitude) the Duration is infinite: And consequently the impressed\r\nForce, and Motion thence arising, never to be wholly extinguished\r\n(without some further Impediment) but perpetually approaching to _A_, in\r\nthe Nature of Asymptotes.\r\n\r\n17. The Spaces _Fl_, _Fm_, _Fn_, &c. are therefore as Logarithms (in\r\nArithmetical Progression increasing) answering to the Lines _AF_, _AL_,\r\n_AM_, &c. or to _FL_, _LM_, _MN_, &c. in Geometrical Progression\r\ndecreasing.\r\n\r\n18. Because _FL_, _LM_, _MN_, &c. are as 1/_m_, 1/_mm_, 1/_m_³, &c.\r\n(infinitely) terminated at _A_; therefore (by ¶ 10) their Aggregate _FA_\r\nor _dh_, is to _DH_, (so much Length as would have been dispatched, in\r\nthe same time, by such impressed Force undiminished) as 1 to _m_ - 1 =\r\n_n_.\r\n\r\n19. If therefore we take, as 1 to _n_, so _AF_ to _DH_; this will\r\nrepresent the Length to be dispatched, in the same time, by such\r\nundiminished Force.\r\n\r\n20. And if such _DH_ be supposed to be divided into equal Parts\r\ninnumerable (and therefore infinitely small;) these answer to those (as\r\nmany) Parts unequal in _FA_, or _hd_.\r\n\r\n21. But, what is the Proportion of _r_ to 1, or (which depends on it) of\r\n1 - _r_ to 1, or 1 to _m_; remains to be inquired by Experiment?\r\n\r\n22. If the Progression be not infinitely continued; but end (suppose) at\r\n_N_, and its least Term be _A_ = _MN_; then, out of\r\n\r\n _V_/(_R_ - 1) = 1/_m_ + 1/_mm_ + 1/_m_³, _&c._\r\n\r\nis to be subducted _A_/(_R_ - 1) (as at ¶ 10.) that is (as by Division\r\nwill appear)\r\n\r\n _A_/_R_ + _A_/_R_² + _A_/_R_³ &c.\r\n\r\nThat is (in our present Case)\r\n\r\n _a_/_m_ + _a_/_mm_ + _a_/_m_³ &c.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Aggregate will be\r\n\r\n (1-_a_)/_m_ + (1-_a_)/_mm_ + (1-_a_)/_m_³ &c. = (1-_a_)/_n_.\r\n\r\nAnd thus as to the Line of Projection, in which (secluding the\r\nResistance) the Motion is reputed uniform; dispatching equal Lengths in\r\nequal Times. Consider we next the Line of Descent.\r\n\r\n23. In the Descent of Heavy Bodies, it is supposed that to each Moment\r\nof Time, there is superadded a new Impulse of Gravity to what was\r\nbefore: And each of these, secluding the Consideration of the Air's\r\nResistance, to proceed equally (from their several beginnings) through\r\nthe succeeding Moments. As (in the erect Lines) 1 1 1 1, _&c._ 1 1 1,\r\n_&c._ 1 1, _&c._ 1, _&c._ and so continually, as in the Line of\r\nProjection.[16]\r\n\r\n24. Hence ariseth (in the transverse Lines) for the first Moment 1, for\r\nthe second 1 + 1, for the third 1 + 1 + 1, and so forth, in Arithmetical\r\nProgression: As are the Ordinates in a Triangle, at equal distance.\r\n\r\n25. And such are the continual Increments of the Diameter, or of the\r\nOrdinates in the exterior Parabola, answering to the interior Ordinates,\r\nor Segments of the Tangent, equally increasing; as is known, and\r\ncommonly admitted.\r\n\r\n26. If we take in the Consideration of the Air's Resistance; we are\r\nthen, for each of these equal Progressions, to substitute a decreasing\r\nProgression Geometrical; in like manner (and for the same Reasons) as in\r\nthe Line of Projection.\r\n\r\n27. Hence ariseth, for the first Moment 1/_m_; for the second 1/_m_ +\r\n1/_m_²; for the third 1/_m_ + 1/_m_² + 1/_m_³, _&c._[17] And such is\r\ntherefore the Descent of a heavy Body falling by its own weight. The\r\nseveral Impulses of Gravity being supposed equal.\r\n\r\n28. That is (in the Figure of ¶ 12) as _FL_, _FM_, _FN_, &c. in the Line\r\nof Descent, answering to _FL_, _LM_, _MN_, &c. in the Line of Projection.\r\n\r\n29. But though the Progressions for the Line of Projection, are like to\r\neach of those many in the Line of Descent; it is not to be thence\r\ninferred, that therefore 1/_m_ in the one, is equal to 1/_m_ in the\r\nother: But in the Line of Projection (suppose) (1/_m_)_f_ (such a Part\r\nof the Force impressed, and a Celerity answerable:) in the Line of\r\nDescent, (1/_m_)_g_ such a Part of the Impulse of Gravity.\r\n\r\n30. Those for the Line of Descent (of the some Body) are all equal, each\r\nto other: Because _g_ (the new Impulse of Gravity) in each Moment is\r\nsupposed to be the same.\r\n\r\n31. But what is the Proportion of _f_ to _g_ (that of the Force\r\nimpressed, to the Impulse of Gravity in each Body) remains to be\r\ninquired by Experiment.\r\n\r\n32. This Proportion being found as to one known Force; the same is\r\nthence known as to any other Force (whose Proportion to this is given)\r\nin the same uniform _Medium_.\r\n\r\n33. And this being known, as to one _Medium_; the same is thence known\r\nas to any other _Medium_, the Proportion of whose Resistance to that of\r\nthis is known.\r\n\r\n34. If a heavy Body be projected downward in a perpendicular Line; it\r\ndescends therefore at the Rate 1/_m_, 1/_mm_, 1/_m_³, _&c._ of _f_,\r\n(the impressed Force) increased by 1/_m_, 1/_m_ + 1/_m_², 1/_m_ +\r\n1/_m_² + 1/_m_³, _&c._ of _g_ the impulse of Gravity, (by ¶ 7, and ¶\r\n27) Because both Forces are here united.\r\n\r\n35. If in a perpendicular Projection upwards; it ascends in the rate of\r\nthe former, abated by that of the latter. Because here the impulse of\r\nGravity is contrary to the Force impressed.\r\n\r\n36. When therefore this latter (continually increasing) becomes equal to\r\nthat former (continually decreasing) it then ceaseth to ascend; and doth\r\nthenceforth descend at the rate wherein the latter continually exceeds\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\n37. In an Horizontal, or Oblique Projection: If to a Tangent, whose\r\nIncrements are as _FL_, _LM_, _MN_, &c. that is as (1/_m_)_f_, &c. be\r\nfitted Ordinates (at a given Angle) whose Increments are as _FL_, _FM_,\r\n_FN_, &c. that is, as (1/_m_)_g_, &c. The Curve answering to the\r\nCompound of these Motions, is that wherein the Project is to move.\r\n\r\n38. This Curve (being hitherto without a Name) may be call'd _Linea\r\nProjectorum_; the Line of Projects, or things projected; which resembles\r\na Parabola deform'd.\r\n\r\n39. The Celerity and Tendency, as to each Point of this Line, is\r\ndetermined by a Tangent at that Point.\r\n\r\n40. And that against which it makes the greatest Stroke or Percussion,\r\nis that which (at that Point) is at right Angles to that Tangent.\r\n\r\n41. If the Projection (at ¶ 27) be not infinitely continued, but\r\nterminate (suppose) at _N_, so that the last Term in the first Column or\r\nSeries erect be _a_; and consequently in the second, _ma_; in the third,\r\n_mma_, &c. (each Series having one Term fewer than that before it:) Then\r\n(for the same Reasons, as at ¶ 22) the Aggregates of the several Columns\r\n(or erect Series) will be (1 - _a_)/_n_, (1 - _ma_)/_n_, (1 - _mma_)/_n_,\r\nand so forth, till (the Multiple of _a_ becoming = 1) the Progression\r\nexpire.\r\n\r\n42. Now all the Abatements here, _a_, _ma_, _mma_, &c. are the same with\r\nthe Terms of the first Column taken backward. For _a_ is the last, _ma_\r\nthe next before it; and so of the rest.\r\n\r\n43. And the Aggregate of all the Numerators is so many times 1, as is\r\nthe Number of Terms (suppose _t_,) wanting the first Column; that is\r\n\r\n _t_ - (1 - _a_)/_n_, or (_nt_ - 1 + _a_)/_n_;\r\n\r\nand this again divided by the common Denominator _n_, becomes\r\n\r\n (_nt_ - 1 + _a_)/_nn_.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore ((_nt_ - 1 + _a_)/_nn_)_g_, is the Line of Descent by its\r\nown Gravity.\r\n\r\n44. If therefore this be added to a projecting Force downward in a\r\nPerpendicular; or subducted from such projecting Force upward; that is,\r\nto or from ((1 - _a_)/_n_)_f_: The Descent in the first Case will be\r\n\r\n ((1 - _a_)/_n_)_f_ + ((_nt - 1 + a_)/_nn_)_g_;\r\n\r\nand the Ascent in the other Case\r\n\r\n ((1 - _a_)/_n_)_f_ - ((_nt - 1 + a_)/_nn_)_g_.\r\n\r\nAnd in this latter Case, when the ablative Part becomes equal to the\r\npositive Part, the Ascent is at the highest; and thenceforth (the\r\nablative Part exceeding the positive) will descend.\r\n\r\n45. In an Horizontal or Oblique Projection, having taken\r\n\r\n ((1 - _a_)/_n_)_f_,\r\n\r\nin the Line of Projection, and thence (at the Angle given)\r\n\r\n ((_nt_ - 1 + _a_)/_nn_)_g_,\r\n\r\nin the Line of Descent; the Point in the Curve answering to these, is\r\nthe Place of the Project answering to that Moment.\r\n\r\n46. I am aware of some Objections to be made, whether to some Points of\r\nthe Process, or to some of the Suppositions. But I saw not well how to\r\nwave it, without making the Computation much more perplex'd. And in a\r\nMatter so nice, and which must depend upon Physical Observations, 'twill\r\nbe hard to attain such Accuracy, as not to stand in need of some\r\nAllowances.\r\n\r\n47. Somewhat might have been farther added to direct the Experiments\r\nsuggested at ¶ 21, and 31. But that may be done at leisure, after\r\ndeliberation had, which way to attempt the Experiment.\r\n\r\n48. The like is to be said of the different resistance which different\r\nBodies may meet with in the same _Medium_, according to their different\r\nGravities (extensively or intensively consider'd) and their different\r\nFigures and Positions in Motion. Whereof we have hitherto taken no\r\naccount; but supposed them, as to all these, to be alike and equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_POSTSCRIPT._\r\n\r\n49. The Computation in ¶ 41, 42, 43, may (if that be also desired) be\r\nthus represented by Lines and Spaces. The Ablatives _a_, _ma_, _mma_,\r\n&c. (being the same with the first Column taken backward) are fitly\r\nrepresented by the Segments of _NF_ (beginning at _N_) in Figure 5 and\r\n6, and therefore by Parallelograms on these Bases, assuming the common\r\nheight of _Fh_, or _NQ_; the Aggregate of which is _Nh_, or _FQ_. And,\r\nso many times 1, by so many equal Spaces, on the same Bases, between the\r\nsame Parallels, terminated at the Hyperbola: The Aggregate of which is\r\n_hFNQn_. From whence if we subduct the Aggregate of Ablatives _FY_; the\r\nremaining Trilinear _hQn_, represents the Descent.\r\n\r\n50. If to this of Gravity, be joined a projecting Force; which is to the\r\nImpulse of Gravity as _hK_ to _hF_ (be it greater, less, or equal) taken\r\nin the same Line; the same Parallels determine proportional\r\nParallelograms, whose Aggregate is _KQ_.\r\n\r\n51. And therefore if this be a perpendicular Projection downwards; then\r\n_hKkn_ (the Sum of this with the former) represents the Descent.\r\n\r\n52. If it be a Perpendicular upwards; then the difference of these two\r\nrepresents the Motion; which so long as _KQ_ is the greater, is\r\nAscendent; but Descendent, when _hQn_ becomes greater; and it is then at\r\nthe highest when they be equal.\r\n\r\n53. If the Projection be not in the same Perpendicular, (but Horizontal,\r\nor Oblique) then _KQ_ represents the Tangent of the Curve; and _hQn_ the\r\nOrdinates to that Tangent, at the given Angle.\r\n\r\n54. But the Computation before given, I take to be of better use than\r\nthis Representation in Figure. Because in such Mathematical Enquiries, I\r\nchoose to separate (as much as may be) what purely concerns Proportions;\r\nand consider it abstractly from Lines, or other Matter wherewith it is\r\nincumbred.\r\n\r\nAs to the Question proposed; whether the resistance of the _Medium_ do\r\nnot always take off such a proportional part of the Force moving through\r\nit, as is the specifick Gravity of the _Medium_ to that of the Body\r\nmoved in it: (For, if so, it will save us the trouble of Observation.)\r\n\r\nI think this can by no means be admitted. For there be many other things\r\nof Consideration herein, beside the intensive Gravity (or, as some call\r\nit, the specifick Gravity) of the _Medium_.\r\n\r\nA viscous _Medium_ shall more resist, than one more fluid, though of\r\nlike intensive Gravity.\r\n\r\nAnd a sharp Arrow shall bore his way more easily through the _Medium_,\r\nthan a blunt-headed Bolt, though of equal Weight, and like intensive\r\nGravity.\r\n\r\nAnd the same Pyramid with the Point, than with the Base forward.\r\n\r\nAnd many other like Varieties, intended in my ¶ 48.\r\n\r\nBut this I think may be admitted, namely, That different _Mediums_,\r\nequally liquid, (and other Circumstances alike,) do in such proportion\r\nresist, as is their intensive Gravity. Because there is, in such\r\nproportion, a heavier Object to be removed, by the same Force. Which is\r\none of the things to which ¶ 33 refers.\r\n\r\nAnd again: The heavier Project once in Motion, (being equally swift, and\r\nall other Circumstances alike) moves through the same _Medium_ in such\r\nproportion more strongly, as is its intensive Gravity. For now the Force\r\nis in such proportion greater, for the removal of the same resistance.\r\nAnd this Part of what my ¶ 32, insinuates.\r\n\r\nBut where there is a Complication of these Considerations one with\r\nanother, and with many other Circumstances, whereof each is severally to\r\nbe considered; there must be respect had to all of them.\r\n\r\n[14]\r\n R - 1_V_) _R_ (_V_ + _V/R_, _V/RR_, &c.\r\n                _VR_ - V\r\n                --------\r\n                     + V\r\n                      + V/VR\r\n                     -------\r\n                      + V/R\r\n                     + VV/RRR\r\n                     --------\r\n                      + V/RR\r\n                         _&c_.\r\n\r\n[15]\r\n _m_ - 1) 1 (1/_m_ + 1/_mm_ + 1/_m_³ + &c.\r\n          1 - 1/_m_\r\n           -------\r\n           + 1/_m_\r\n           + 1/_m_ - 1/_mm_\r\n             --------------\r\n                + 1/_mm_\r\n                + 1/_mm_ - 1/_mmm_\r\n                  ----------------\r\n                          + 1/_mmm_\r\n                   &c.\r\n\r\n[16]\r\n 1\r\n 1 1\r\n 1 1 1\r\n 1 1 1 1\r\n _&c._\r\n\r\n[17]\r\n   1\r\n  ---\r\n  _m_\r\n\r\n   1    1\r\n ----- ---\r\n _m_² _m_\r\n\r\n   1     1    1\r\n ----- ----- ---\r\n _m_³ _m_² _m_\r\n\r\n   1     1     1    1\r\n ----- ----- ----- ---\r\n _m_⁴ _m_³ _m_² _m_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _An Instance of the Excellence of the _Modern Algebra_, in the\r\n   Resolution of the Problem of finding the _Foci_ of Optick Glasses\r\n   Universally. By _E. Halley_, S. R. S._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Excellence of the _Modern Geometry_ is in nothing more evident, than\r\nin those full and adequate Solutions it gives to Problems; representing\r\nall the possible Cases at one view, and in one general Theorem, many\r\ntimes comprehending whole Sciences; which deduced at length into\r\nPropositions, and demonstrated after the manner of the _Ancients_, might\r\nwell become the Subjects of large Treatises: For whatsoever Theorem\r\nsolves the most complicated Problem of the kind, does with a due\r\nReduction reach all the subordinate Cases. Of this I now design to give\r\na notable Instance in the Doctrine of _Dioptricks_.\r\n\r\nThis Dioptrick Problem is that of finding the _Focus_ of any sort of\r\n_Lens_, exposed either to converging, diverging, or parallel Rays of\r\nLight, proceeding from, or tending to a given Point in the _Axis_ of the\r\n_Lens_, be the _Ratio_ of _Refraction_ what it will, according to the\r\nNature of the transparent Material whereof the _Lens_ is formed, and\r\nalso with allowance for the thickness of the _Lens_ between the\r\n_Vertices_ of the two Spherical Segments. This Problem being solved in\r\none Case, _mutatis mutandis_, will exhibit Theorems for all the possible\r\nCases, whether the _Lens_ be _Double-Convex_ or _Double-Concave_,\r\n_Plano-Convex_, or _Plano-Concave_, or _Convexo-Concave_, which sort are\r\nusually call'd _Menisci_. But this only to be understood of those Beams\r\nwhich are nearest to the _Axis_ of the _Lens_, so as to occasion no\r\nsensible difference by their Inclination thereto; and the _Focus_ here\r\nformed, is by _Dioptrick Writers_ commonly call'd the principal _Focus_,\r\nbeing that of use in _Telescopes_ and _Microscopes_.\r\n\r\nLet then (in _Fig. 7. Tab. 5._) BEβ be a double Convex _Lens_, C the\r\nCenter of the Segment EB, and K the Center of the Segment Eβ, Bβ the\r\nthickness of the _Lens_, D a Point in the _Axis_ of the _Lens_; and it\r\nis required to find the Point F, at which the Beams proceeding from the\r\nPoint D, are collected therein, the _Ratio_ of Refraction being as _m_\r\nto _n_. Let the distance of the Object DB = DA = _d_ (the Point A being\r\nsupposed the same with B, but taken at a distance therefrom, to prevent\r\nthe coincidence of so many Lines) the _Radius_ of the Segment towards\r\nthe Object CB or CA = _r_, and the _Radius_ of the Segment from the\r\nObject Kβ or K = ρ; and let Bβ the thickness of the _Lens_ be =\r\n_t_, and then let the Sine of the Angle of Incidence DAG be to the Sine\r\nof the refracted Angle HAG or CAφ as _m_ to _n_: And in very small\r\nAngles, the Angles themselves will be in the same proportion; whence it\r\nwill follow that,\r\n\r\nAs _d_ to _r_, so the Angle at C to the Angle at D, and _d + r_ will be\r\nas the Angle of Incidence GAD; and again as _m_ to _n_, so _d + r_ to\r\n(_dn + rn_)/_m_, which will be as the Angle GAH = CAφ; This being\r\ntaken from ACD which is as _d_, will leave (_m - nd - nr_)/_m_ analogous\r\nto the Angle AφD; and the Sides being in this Case proportional to\r\nthe Angles they subtend, it will follow, that as the Angle AφD is to\r\nthe Angle ADφ, so is the Side AD or BD to Aφ or Bφ: That is,\r\nBφ will be = _mdr_/(_m - nd - nr_), which shews in what Point the\r\nBeams proceeding from D, would be collected by means of the first\r\nRefraction; but if _nr_ cannot be subtracted from _m - nd_, it follows\r\nthat the Beams after Refraction do still pass on diverging, and the\r\nPoint φ is on the same side of the _Lens_ beyond D. But if _nr_ be\r\nequal to _m - nd_, then they proceed parallel to the _Axis_, and the\r\nPoint φ is infinitely distant.\r\n\r\nThe Point φ being found as before, and Bφ - Bβ being given,\r\nwhich we will call δ, it follows by a Process like the former, that\r\nβF, or the focal Distance sought, is equal to\r\n\r\n _δρn_/(_m - δ + mρ_) = _f_.\r\n\r\nAnd in the room of δ substituting\r\n\r\n Bφ - Bβ = _mdr_/(_m - nd - nr_) - _t_,\r\n\r\nputting _p_ for _n_/(_m - n_), after due Reduction this following\r\nEquation will arise,\r\n\r\n (_mpdrρ - ndρt + nprρt_)/(_mdr + mdρ - mprρ - m - ndt + nrt_)\r\n = _f_.\r\n\r\nWhich Theorem, however it may seem operose, is not so, considering the\r\ngreat Number of _Data_ that enter the Question; and that one half of the\r\nTerms arise from our taking in the thickness of the _Lens_, which in\r\nmost Cases can produce no great Effect; however it was necessary to\r\nconsider it, to make our Rule perfect. If therefore the _Lens_ consist\r\nof _Glass_, whose Refraction is as 3 to 2 'twill be\r\n\r\n (_6drρ - 2dρt + 4rρt_)/(_3dr + 3dρ - 6rρ - dt + 2rt_) = _f_.\r\n\r\nIf of _Water_, whose Refraction is as 4 to 3, the Theorem will stand thus\r\n\r\n (_12drρ - 3dρt + 9rρt_)/(_4dr + 4dρ - 12rρ - dt + 3rt_) = _f_.\r\n\r\nIf it could be made of _Diamant_, whose Refraction is as 5 to 2, it\r\nwould be\r\n\r\n (_(10/3)drρ - 2dρt + (4/3)rρt_)/(_5dr + 5dρ - (10/3)rρ - 3dt\r\n + 2rt_) = _f_.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the universal Rule for the _Foci_ of double Convex Glasses\r\nexposed to diverging Rays. But if the thickness of the _Lens_ be\r\nrejected, as not sensible, the Rule will be much shorter, _viz._\r\n\r\n _pdrρ_/(_dr + dρ - prt_) = _f_,\r\n\r\nor in Glass\r\n\r\n _2drρ_/(_dr + dρ - 2rρ_) = _f_,\r\n\r\nall the Terms wherein _t_ is found being omitted, as equal to nothing.\r\nIn this Case, if _d_ be so small, as that _2rρ_ exceed _dr + dρ_,\r\nthen will it be - _f_, or the _Focus_ will be Negative, which shews that\r\nthe Beams after both Refractions still proceed diverging.\r\n\r\nTo bring this to the other Cases, as of converging Beams, or of Concave\r\nGlasses, the Rule is ever composed of the same Terms, only changing the\r\nSigns of + and -; for the distance of the Point of Concourse of\r\nconverging Beams, from the Point B, or the first Surface of the _Lens_,\r\nI call a negative Distance or - _d_; and the Radius of a Concave _Lens_\r\nI call a negative Radius, or - _r_ if it be the first Surface, and - ρ\r\nif it be the second Surface. Let then converging Beams fall on a double\r\nConvex of Glass, and the Theorem will stand thus\r\n\r\n - _2drρ_/(- _dr - dρ - 2rt_) = + _f_,\r\n\r\nwhich shews that in this Case the _Focus_ is always affirmative.\r\n\r\nIf the _Lens_ were a _Meniscus_ of Glass, exposed to diverging Beams,\r\nthe Rule is\r\n\r\n - _2drρ_/(- _dr + dρ + 2rρ_) = _f_,\r\n\r\nwhich is affirmative when _2rρ_ is less than _dr - dρ_ otherwise\r\nnegative: But in the Case of converging Beams falling on the same\r\n_Meniscus_, 'twill be\r\n\r\n + _2drρ_/(+ _dr - dρ + 2rp_) = _f_,\r\n\r\nand it will be + _f_, whilst _dρ - dr_ is less than _2rρ_; but if it\r\nbe greater than _2rρ_, it will always be found negative or - _f_. If\r\nthe _Lens_ be double Concave, the _Focus_ of converging Beams is\r\nnegative, where it was affirmative in the Case of diverging Beams on a\r\ndouble Convex, _viz._\r\n\r\n - _2drρ_/(+ _dr + dρ - 2rρ_) = _f_,\r\n\r\nwhich is affirmative only when _2rρ_ exceeds _dr + dρ_: But\r\ndiverging Beams passing a double Concave, have always a negative\r\n_Focus_, _viz._\r\n\r\n - _2drρ_/(+ _dr + dρ + 2rρ_) = - _f_.\r\n\r\nThe Theorems for converging Beams, are principally of use to determine\r\nthe _Focus_ resulting from any sort of _Lens_ placed in a Telescope,\r\nbetween the _Focus_ of the Object-Glass and the Glass it self; the\r\ndistance between the said _Focus_ of the Object-Glass, and the\r\ninterposed _Lens_ being made = - _d_.\r\n\r\nI here suppose my Reader acquainted with the Rules of Analytical\r\nMultiplication and Division, as that + multiplied by + makes the Product\r\n+, + by - makes -, and - by - makes +; so dividing + by + makes the\r\nQuote +, + by - makes -, and - by - makes +; which will be necessary to\r\nbe understood in the preceding Examples.\r\n\r\nIn case the Beams are parallel, as coming from an infinite distance,\r\n(which is supposed in the Case of Telescopes) then will _d_ be supposed\r\nInfinite, and in the Theorem\r\n\r\n _pdρr_/(_dr + dρ - prρ_)\r\n\r\nthe Term _prρ_ vanishes, as being finite, which is no part of the\r\nother infinite Terms; and dividing the Remainder by the infinite Part\r\n_d_, the Theorem will stand thus _pρr_/(_r + ρ_) = _f_, or in Glass,\r\n_2rρ_/(_r + ρ_) = _f_.\r\n\r\nIn case the _Lens_ were _Plano-Convex_ exposed to diverging Beams,\r\ninstead of _pdρr_/(_dr + dρ - prρ_), _r_ being infinite, it will\r\nbe _pdρ_/(_d - pρ_) = _f_, or _2dρ_/(_d - 2ρ_) if the _Lens_ be\r\nGlass.\r\n\r\nIf the _Lens_ be Double-Convex, and _r_ be equal to ρ, as being formed\r\nof Segments of equal Spheres, then will (_pdρr_)/(_dr + dρ - prρ_)\r\nbe reduced to (_pdr_/(_2d - pr_))_f_; and in case _d_ be infinite, then\r\nit will yet be farther contracted to ½_pr_, and _p_ being = _n_/(_m\r\n- n_), the focal distance in Glass will be = _r_, in Water 1½_r_,\r\nbut in Diamant ⅓_r_.\r\n\r\nI am sensible that these Examples are too much for the compleat Analyst,\r\nthough I fear too little for the less Skilful; it being very hard, if\r\npossible, in such Matters, so to write, as to give satisfaction to both;\r\nor to please the one, and instruct the other. But this may suffice to\r\nshew the extent of our Theorem, and how easie a Reduction adapts any one\r\ncase to all the rest.\r\n\r\nNor is this only useful to discover the _Focus_ from the other proposed\r\n_data_, but from the _Focus_ given, we may thereby determine the\r\ndistance of the Object; or from the _Focus_ and Distance given, we may\r\nfind of what Sphere it is requisite to take another Segment, to make any\r\ngiven Segment of another Sphere cast the Beams from the distance _d_ to\r\nthe _Focus_ _f_. As likewise from the _Lens_, _Focus_, and Distance\r\ngiven, to find the _Ratio_ of Refraction, or of _m_ to _n_, requisite to\r\nanswer those _Data_. All which it is obvious, are fully determined from\r\nthe Equation we have hitherto used, _viz._\r\n\r\n _pdρr_ = _drf + dρf - prρf_,\r\n\r\nfor to find _d_ the Theorem is (_prρf_)/(_rf + ρf - pρr_) = _d_,\r\nthe distance of the Object.\r\n\r\nFor ρ the Rule is\r\n\r\n _drf_/(_pdr + df + prf_) = ρ.\r\n\r\nBut for _p_ will be\r\n\r\n (_drf + dρf_)/(_dρr + fρr_) = _p_,\r\n\r\nwhich latter determines the _Ratio_ of Refraction, _m_ being to _n_, as\r\n1 + _p_ to _p_.\r\n\r\nI shall not expatiate on these Particulars, but leave them for the\r\nExercise of those that are desirous to be informed in Optical Matters,\r\nwhich I am bold to say are comprehended in these three Rules, as fully\r\nas the most Inquisitive can desire them, and in all possible Cases;\r\nregard being had to the Signs + and -, as in the former Cases of finding\r\nthe _Focus_. I shall only shew two considerable Uses of them; the one to\r\nfind the distance whereat an Object being plac'd, shall by a given\r\n_Lens_ be represented in a _Species_ as large as the Object it self,\r\nwhich may be of singular Use in drawing Faces and other things in their\r\ntrue Magnitude, by transmitting the _Species_ by a Glass into a dark\r\nRoom, which will not only give the true Figure and Shades, but even the\r\nColours themselves, almost as vivid as the Life. In this Case _d_ is\r\nequal to _f_, and substituting _d_ for _f_ in the Equation, we shall have\r\n\r\n _pdrρ_ = _ddr + ddρ - dpρr_,\r\n\r\nand dividing all by _dprρ_ = _dr + dρ - prρ_, that is, _2prρ_/(_r + ρ_)\r\n= _d_; but if the two Convexities be of the same Sphere so as _r_ = ρ,\r\nthen will the distance be = _pr_; that is, if the _Lens_ be Glass =\r\n_2r_, so that if an Object be placed at the Diameter of the Sphere\r\ndistant, in this Case the _Focus_ will be as far within as the Object is\r\nwithout, and the _Species_ represented thereby will be as big as the\r\nLife; but if it were a _Plano-Convex_, the same distance will be =\r\n_2pr_, or in Glass to four times the _Radius_ of the Convexity; but of\r\nthis Method I may entertain the Curious at some other Time, and shew how\r\nto magnifie or diminish an Object in any proportion assign'd, (which yet\r\nwill be obvious enough from what is here deliver'd) as likewise how to\r\nerect the Object which in this Method is represented inverted.\r\n\r\nA Second Use is to find what Convexity or Concavity is required, to make\r\na vastly distant Object be represented at a given _Focus_, after the one\r\nSurface of the _Lens_ is formed; which is but a Corollary of our Theorem\r\nfor finding ρ, having _p_, _d_, _r_ and _f_ given; for _d_ being\r\ninfinite, that Rule becomes\r\n\r\n _rf_/(_pr - f_) = ρ,\r\n\r\nthat is in Glass _rf_/(_2r - f_) = ρ, whence if _f_ be greater than\r\n_2r_, ρ becomes Negative, and _rf_/(_f - 2r_) is the _Radius_ of the\r\nConcave sought.\r\n\r\nThose that are wholly to begin with this Dioptrical Science, cannot do\r\nbetter than to read with Attention a late Treatise of Dioptricks,\r\npublished by _W. Molineux_, Esq, R. S. S. who has at large shewn the\r\nNature of Optick Glasses, and the Construction and Use of Microscopes\r\nand Telescopes; and though some nicely Critical have endeavour'd to spy\r\nFaults, and to traduce the Book; yet having long since examin'd it with\r\nCare, I affirm, that if I can judge, it hath but two things that with\r\nany Colour may be call'd Faults; the one, an over-careful acknowledgment\r\nof every Trifle the Author had receiv'd from others; and the other that\r\nhe labours to make easie this curious Subject, so little understood by\r\nmost, in a manner perhaps too familiar for the _Learned Critick_, and\r\nwhich demonstrates that it was writ _cum animo docendi_, both which\r\nrequire but very little Friendship or good Nature in the Reader, to pass\r\nfor Vertues in an Author.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tab. 5. pag. 359_]\r\n\r\nBut to return to our first Theorem, which accounting for the thickness\r\nof the _Lens_, we will here again resume, _viz._\r\n\r\n (_mpdrρ - ndρt + nprρt_)/(_mdr + mdρ - mprρ - m - ndt + nrt_)\r\n = _f_.\r\n\r\nAnd let it be required to find the _Focus_ where a whole Sphere will\r\ncollect the Beams proceeding from an Object at the distance _d_: Here\r\n_t_ is equal to _2r_, and _r_ equal to ρ. And after due Reduction, the\r\nTheorem will stand thus,\r\n\r\n (_mpdr - 2ndr + 2nprr_)/(_2nd + 2nr - mpr_) = _f_;\r\n\r\nbut if _d_ be Infinite, it is contracted to\r\n\r\n _mpr_/_2n_ - _r_ = ((_2n - m_)/(_2m - 2n_))_r_ = _f_,\r\n\r\nwherefore a Sphere of Glass collects the Sun-Beams at half the\r\nSemi-diameter of the Sphere without it, and a Sphere of Water at a whole\r\nSemi-diameter. But if the _Ratio_ of Refraction _m_ to _n_ be as 2 to 1,\r\nthe _Focus_ falls on the opposite Surface of the Sphere; but if it be of\r\ngreater Inequality it falls within.\r\n\r\nAnother Example shall be when a Hemisphere is exposed to parallel Rays,\r\nthat is, _d_ and ρ being infinite, and _t_ = _r_, and after due\r\nReduction the Theorem results\r\n\r\n (_nn_/(_mm - mn_))_r_ = _f_.\r\n\r\nThat is, in Glass it is at 4/3_r_, in Water at 9/4_r_; but if the\r\nHemisphere were Diamant, it would collect the Beams at 1-4/15 of the\r\n_Radius_ beyond the Center.\r\n\r\n_Lastly_, As to the Effect of turning the two sides of a _Lens_ towards\r\nan Object; it is evident, that if the thickness of the _Lens_ be very\r\nsmall, so as that you neglect it, or account _t_ = 0; then in all Cases\r\nthe _Focus_ of the same _Lens_, to whatsoever Beams, will be the same,\r\nwithout any difference upon the turning the _Lens_: But if you are so\r\ncurious as to consider the thickness, (which is seldom worth accounting\r\nfor) in the Case of parallel Rays falling on a _Plano-Convex_ of Glass,\r\nif the plain side be towards the Object, _t_ does occasion no\r\ndifference, but the focal distance _f_ = 2_r_. But when the Convex-side\r\nis towards the Object, it is contracted to _2r - ⅔t_, so that the\r\n_Focus_ is nearer by ⅔_t_. If the _Lens_ be double Convex, the\r\ndifference is less; if a _Meniscus_, greater. If the Convexity on both\r\nsides be equal, the focal length is about ⅙_t_ shorter than when _t_ = 0.\r\nIn a _Meniscus_ the Concave-side towards the Object increases the\r\nfocal Length, but the Convex towards the Object diminishes it. A General\r\nRule for the difference arising on turning the _Lens_, where the _Focus_\r\nis Affirmative, is this\r\n\r\n (_2rt - 2ρt_)/(_3r + 3ρ - t_),\r\n\r\nfor double Convexes of differing Spheres.

As if the\r\nEquation were\r\n\r\n 5_y_ + 20_y_³ + 16_y_⁵ = 682,\r\n\r\nthe Logarithm of _2a_ = 3.1348143 whose Fifth part is 0.6269628, the\r\nNumber answering is 4.236, and the Number answering the Arithmetical\r\nComplement 9.3730372 is 0.236, the half difference of these Numbers is 2\r\n= _y_.\r\n\r\nBut if in the aforegoing Equation the Signs are alternately Affirmative\r\nand Negative; or which is the same thing if the Series be after this\r\nmanner,\r\n\r\n _ny_ + ((1 - _nn_)/(2 × 3))_ny_³ + ((1 - _nn_)/(2 × 3)) ×\r\n ((9 - _nn_)/(4 × 5))_ny_⁵ + ((1 - _nn_)/(2 × 3)) ×\r\n ((9 - _nn_)/(4 × 5)) × ((25 - _nn_)/(6 × 7))_ny_⁷ + _&c._ = _a_.\r\n\r\nThe Root of it will be equal to\r\n\r\n (1) _y_ = ½[ⁿ√](_a_ + √(_aa_ - 1)) +\r\n           ½/[ⁿ√](_a_ + √(_aa_ - 1)), or\r\n\r\n (2) _y_ = ½[ⁿ√](_a_ + √(_aa_ - 1)) +\r\n           ½[ⁿ√](_a_ - √(_aa_ - 1)), or\r\n\r\n (3) _y_ = ½/[ⁿ√](_a_ - √(_aa_ - 1)) +\r\n           ½[ⁿ√](_a_ - √(_aa_ - 1)), or\r\n\r\n (4) _y_ = ½/[ⁿ√](_a_ - √(_aa_ - 1)) +\r\n           ½/[ⁿ√](_a_ + √(_aa_ - 1)).\r\n\r\nHere it is to be noted, that if (_n_ - 1)/2 be an odd Number, the Sign\r\nof the Root found must be contrary to it.\r\n\r\nLet an Equation be propos'd\r\n\r\n 5_y_ - 20_y_³ + 16_y_⁵ = 6,\r\n\r\nwhence _n_ = 5, and _a_ = 6, and the Root will be =\r\n\r\n ½[⁵√](6 + √(35)) + ½/[⁵√](6 + √(35))\r\n\r\nor because 6 + √35 = 11.916 whose Logarithm is 1.0761304, and its\r\nFifth part is 0.2152561, whose Arithmetical Complement is 9.7847439. The\r\nNumbers belonging to these Logarithms are 1.6415 and 0.6091, whose half\r\nSum is 1.1253 = _y_.\r\n\r\nBut if it happen that _a_ is less than Unity then the Second Form, as\r\nbeing more convenient, ought to be pitch'd on. So if the Equation had\r\nbeen\r\n\r\n 5_y_ - 20_y_³ + 16_y_⁵ = 61/64,\r\n\r\nthen _y_ will be =\r\n\r\n ½[⁵√](61/64 + √(-375/4096)) +\r\n ½[⁵√](61/64 - √(-375/4096))\r\n\r\nand if the Root of the Fifth Power can by any means be Extracted the\r\ntrue and possible Root of the Equation, will thence Emerge, tho' the\r\nExpression seems to insinuate an Impossibility. But the Root of the\r\nFifth Power of the Binomial\r\n\r\n 61/64 + √(-375/4096) is\r\n ¼ + ¼√(-15)\r\n\r\nand so the same Root of the Binomial\r\n\r\n 61/64 + √(-375/4096) is\r\n ¼ - ¼√(-15)\r\n\r\nthe half Sum of which Roots is = ¼ = _y_.\r\n\r\nBut if that Extraction can not be perform'd, or may seem too difficult,\r\nthe thing may be solv'd by the help of a Table of Natural Sines, after\r\nthe following manner;\r\n\r\nTo the Radius 1 let _a_ = 61/64 = 0,95112 the Sine of some Arch which is\r\ntherefore 72° 23', whose Fifth part (because _n_ is equal to 5) is 14°\r\n28' the Sine of it is 0.24981 = ¼ nearly.\r\n\r\nThe same is the Method of proceeding in Equations of higher Dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n _A Discourse concerning the Action of the Sun and Moon on Animal\r\n   Bodies; and the Influence which This may have in many Diseases. By\r\n   _Richard Mead_, M. D. F. R. S._\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nThat some Diseases are properly the Effects of the Influence of the\r\nHeavenly Bodies, and that others do vary their Periods and Symptoms\r\naccording to the different Positions of one or other of those Luminous\r\nGlobes, is a very ancient and certain Observation. Upon this score\r\n_Hippocrates_[18] advises his Son _Thessalus_ to the study of Geometry\r\nand Numbers, because _the Knowledge of the Stars is of very great use in\r\nPhysick_[19]. And the earliest Histories of Epidemic Distempers,\r\nparticularly do all turn upon the alterations made in our Bodies by the\r\nHeavens.\r\n\r\nBut when in later Times Medicine came to be accommodated to the\r\nReasonings of Philosophers; no body being able to account for the manner\r\nof this Celestial Action, It was allowed no farther share in affecting\r\nour Health, than what might be imputed to the changes in the manifest\r\nConstitution of the Air, excepting perhaps something of Truth which\r\nstill remains disguised and blended with the Jargon of Judiciary\r\nAstrology.\r\n\r\nIn order therefore to set this Matter in a little clearer light, I shall\r\nin the first place shew, That the Sun and Moon regarding their Nearness\r\nand Direction to the Earth only, besides the Effects of Heat, Moisture,\r\n_&c._ thereby caused in our Atmosphere, must at certain times make some\r\nAlterations in all Animal Bodies; then enumerate some Histories and\r\nObservations of such Changes, and enquire of what Use such Thoughts as\r\nthese may be in the Practice of Physick.\r\n\r\nIt is a constant Observation of those who write the History of the\r\n_Winds_, That the most Windy Seasons of the Year, are the Time about the\r\nVernal and Autumnal Equinox; for be the Air never so calm before or\r\nafter, we never fail of having Winds at that Juncture. Every body\r\nlikewise knows, that in the most quiet Weather we are sure of some\r\nBreeze at Mid-day and Mid-night, as also at Full Sea, _i.e._ always\r\nabout the time the Sun or Moon arrive at the Meridian. Seamen and\r\nCountry People reckon upon This, and order their Affairs accordingly.\r\nAnd the changes of the Weather as to Winds or Calms especially about the\r\nNew and Full Moon, are too well known to require any Authority to\r\nconfirm such Remarks. Those who desire a fuller account of these\r\nObservations, may see it in _De Chales_'s Navigation, _Gassendus_'s\r\nNatural Philosophy, and _J. Goad_, his _Astro-Meteoro-Logica_.\r\n\r\nThese things being Matters of Fact, and in a manner Regular and\r\nUniversal, it may very well seem strange that Philosophers have not been\r\nmore accurate in their Enquiries into the Reason of such Appearances.\r\nTrue indeed it is, that the Origin of Winds is various and uncertain,\r\nbut however, so constant and uniform an Effect must undoubtedly be owing\r\nto one necessary Cause.\r\n\r\nIt has bin, now a considerable time since, sufficiently made out, that\r\nour Atmosphere is a thin Elastic Fluid, one part of which gravitates\r\nupon another, and whose Pressure is communicated every way in a Sphere\r\nto any given Part thereof. From hence it follows, That if by any\r\nexternal Cause the Gravity of any one part shou'd be taken off or\r\ndiminished, that from all sides around this part, the more heavy Air\r\nwould rush in to restore the Equilibrium which must of necessity be\r\npreserved in all Fluids. Now this violent running in of the heavier Air\r\nwould certainly produce a Wind, which is no more than a strong Motion of\r\nthe Air in some determined Direction. If therefore we can find any\r\noutward Cause that would at these stated Seasons we have mentioned,\r\ndiminish the Weight or Pressure of the Atmosphere; we shall have the\r\ngenuine Reason of these Periodical Winds, and the necessary Consequences\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nThe Flux and Reflux of the Sea was a Phænomenon too visible, and too\r\nmuch conducing to the Subsistance of Mankind, and all other Animals, to\r\nbe neglected by those who applyed themselves to the Study of Nature;\r\nhowever all their Attempts to explain this Admirable Contrivance of\r\ninfinite Wisdom were unsuccessfull, till Sir _Isaac Newton_ reveal'd to\r\nthe World juster Principles, and by a truer Philosophy than was formerly\r\nknown, shew'd us how by the United or Divided Forces of the Sun and\r\nMoon, which are encreased and lessened by several Circumstances, all the\r\nVarieties of the Tides are to be accounted for. And since all the\r\nChanges we have enumerated in the Atmosphere do fall out at the same\r\ntimes when those happen in the Ocean; and likewise whereas both the\r\nWaters of the Sea and the Air of our Earth, are Fluids subject, in a\r\ngreat Measure, to the same Laws of Motion; it is plain, that the Rule of\r\nour great Philosopher takes place here, _viz._ _That Natural Effects of\r\nthe same kind are owing to the same Causes_.[20]\r\n\r\nWhat difference that known Property of the Air, which is not in Water,\r\nmakes in the Case, I shall shew anon; setting aside the Consideration of\r\nthat for the present; It is certain, That as the Sea is, so must our\r\nAir, twice every 25 Hours, be rais'd upwards to a considerable height,\r\nby the Attraction of the Moon coming to the Meridian; so that instead of\r\na _Spherical_, it must form it self into a _Spheroidal_, or _Oval_\r\nFigure, whose longest Diameter being produced, would pass thro' the\r\nMoon. That the like Raising must follow as often as the Sun is in the\r\nMeridian of any Place, either above or below the Horizon. Moreover, That\r\nthis Elevation is _greatest_ upon the New and Full Moons, because both\r\nSun and Moon do then conspire in their Attraction; _least_ on the\r\nQuarters, in that they then drawing different ways, 'tis only the\r\nDifference of their Actions produces the Effect. Lastly, That this\r\nIntumescence will be of a _middle degree_, at the time between the\r\nQuarters, and New and Full Moon.\r\n\r\nFrom the same Principles, The Motion upwards of the Air will be\r\nstrongest of all about the Equinoxes; the Equinoctial Line being over\r\nthat Circle of the Globe, which has the greatest Diameter, either of the\r\nLuminaries when in that are nearer, and the Agitation of the Fluid\r\nSpheroid revolving about a greater Circle, is greater; besides, the\r\nCentrifugal Force (arising from the Diurnal Rotation) is there greatest\r\nof all. This will still be more considerable about the New and Full\r\nMoons happening at these times, for the Reasons just now mentioned. And\r\nthe least Attraction will be about the Quadratures of these Lunar\r\nMonths, because the Declination of the Moon from the Equator is then\r\ngreatest. The different distances of the Moon in her Perigæum and\r\nApogæum, are the Reason that these full changes fall out a little before\r\nthe Vernal, and after the Autumnal Equinox. Now the Inverse of all this\r\nhappens when the Luminaries are in the Solstitial Circles. Lastly, In\r\nthe same Parallel, when the Moon's Declination is towards the Elevated\r\nPole, the Attraction is strongest when the Moon is in that Places\r\nMeridian, and weakest when she is in the Opposite Places Meridian: The\r\ncontrary happens in the Opposite Parallel; by reason of the Spheroidal\r\nFigure of the Earth and its Atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhatever has been said on this Head, is no more that applying what Sir\r\n_Isaac Newton_ has Demonstrated of the Sea to our Atmosphere; and it is\r\nneedless to shew how necessarily those Appearances, just now mentioned,\r\nof _Winds_, at the Stated Times, _&c._ must happen hereupon. It will be\r\nof more use to consider the Proportion of the Forces of the two\r\nLuminaries upon the _Air_, to that which they have upon the Water of our\r\nGlobe; that it may the more plainly appear what Influence the\r\nAlterations hereby made, must have upon the Animal Body.\r\n\r\nSir _Isaac Newton_ has demonstrated[21] That the Force of the Sun to\r\nmove the Sea, is to the Force of Gravity, as 1 to 12868200. Let that be\r\n\r\n S. G :: 1. _n_. Hence, S = G/_n_.\r\n\r\nAnd that the Force of the Moon to raise the Sea is to Gravity, as 1 to\r\n2031821. Let this be\r\n\r\n L. G :: 1. _s_. Hence, L = G/_s_.\r\n\r\nAnd since the Centrifugal force of the Parts of the Earth arising from\r\nits Diurnal Motion is to Gravity, as 1 to 291. Let this be\r\n\r\n C. G :: 1. C. Then C = G/_e_. Hence,\r\n\r\n (S + L). C :: (G/_n_ + G/_s_). G/_e_ ::\r\n (1/_n_ + 1/_s_). 1/_e_ ::\r\n 1. _sn_/((_s + n_) × _e_) :: 1. 6031.\r\n\r\nThe same Philosopher has taught us[22] that the Centrifugal force raises\r\nthe Water at the Equator above the Water at the Poles, to the height of\r\n85200 Feet. Wherefore if that Force which is as 6031, raise the Ocean to\r\n85200 Feet, the United forces of the Sun and Moon, which are as 1. will\r\nraise the same to 14 Feet, for 85200/6031 = 14. _Proximé_.\r\n\r\nNow we know that the more easily the Waters can obey the Attraction,\r\nwith the more Force are the Tides moved; but since, as Mr. _Halley_ has\r\ndetermin'd it,[23] our Atmosphere is extended to 45 Miles, whereas the\r\nmiddle depth of the Ocean is but about half a Mile; it is plain, that\r\nthe Air revolving in a Sphere about 100 times larger than that of the\r\nOcean, will have a proportionably greater Agitation.\r\n\r\nBesides, Rocks, Shelves, and the inequality of Shoars are a great stop\r\nto the Access and Recess of the Sea: But nothing repels the rising Air,\r\nwhich is also of such thinness and fluidity, that it is easily driven,\r\nand runs every way.\r\n\r\nNor ought we to omit, that it is the universal Law of Bodies Attracted,\r\nthat the Force of Attraction is reciprocally as the Squares of their\r\nDistances; so that the Action of the Sun and Moon will be greater upon\r\nthe Air than upon the Water, upon the Account of its Nearness.\r\n\r\nBut the Consideration of the Elasticity is still of greater Moment here,\r\nof which this is the nature, that it is reciprocally as the Pressure, so\r\nthat the incumbent Weight being diminished by the Attraction, the Air\r\nunderneath will upon this score be mightily expanded.\r\n\r\nThese and such like Causes will make the Tides in the Air to be much\r\ngreater than those of the Ocean; nor is it necessary to our purpose to\r\ndetermine, by nice Calculations, their particular Forces; it is\r\nsufficient to have proved that these Motions must both be Universal, and\r\nalso return at certain Intervals.\r\n\r\nNow since the raising of the Water of the Ocean 14 Feet, produces\r\nTorrents of such a prodigious Force, we may easily conceive what\r\nTempests of Winds (if not otherwise check'd) the Elevation of the Air\r\nmuch higher (perhaps above a Mile) will necessarily cause. And there is\r\nno doubt to be made, but that the same infinitely Wise Being, who\r\ncontrived the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, to secure that vast Collection\r\nof Waters from Stagnation and Corruption (which would inevitably destroy\r\nall the Animals and Vegetables on this Globe) has ordered this Ebb and\r\nFlood of the Air of our Atmosphere, with the like good design, that is\r\nto preserve (in Case all other Causes should fail, as they may, and at\r\ntimes do in some Countries) the sweet Freshness, and brisk Temper of\r\nthis Fluid, so necessary to Life, and keep it, by a kind of continual\r\nCirculation, from Deadness and Stinking.\r\n\r\nThis Reasoning is liable to only one Objection that I know of, and that\r\nis this: That the Appearances we have mention'd cannot be owing to the\r\nCauses now assigned; since by Calculation from them, the Mercury must at\r\nNew and Full Moon subside in the Barometer to a certain degree, which\r\nyet we do not observe to happen.\r\n\r\nIn answer to which, (besides that there have been some Observations made\r\nof the sinking of the Mercury at those times; and it may perhaps be the\r\nfault of the Observers that these have not been reduced to any Rule) We\r\nare to Consider, That altho' Winds and Alterations in the Pressure of\r\nthe Atmosphere, are the necessary consequents of the Lunar Attraction,\r\nand true Causes of the different Rise of the Mercury in the Barometer;\r\nyet these may be produced many others ways too, and therefore tho'\r\nregularly the Mercury would always fall at the New and Full Moon, those\r\nother Causes may be strong enough, even to raise it at those Seasons; in\r\nas much as two contrary Winds, for instance, blowing towards the Place\r\nof Observation, may accumulate the Air there, so as to increase both the\r\nheight and weight of the incumbent Cylinder; in like manner, the\r\nDirection of two Winds may be such, as meeting at certain Angle they may\r\nkeep the Gravity of the Air in the middle place unaltered; and a\r\nThousand such Varieties there may be, by which the Regularity of\r\nAppearances of this nature may be hindered. Now the other Springs, from\r\nwhich such Changes in the Air may arise, are these.\r\n\r\n1. Elastic Vapours forc'd from the Bowels of the Earth, by Subterraneous\r\nHeats, and condensed by whatever cause in the Atmosphere.\r\n\r\n2. A mixture of Effluvia of different qualities in the Air, may by\r\nRarefactions, Fermentations, _&c._ produce Winds and other Effects like\r\nthose resulting from the Combination of some Chymical Liquors; and that\r\nsuch things happen, we are assured from the Nature of Thunder,\r\nLightning, and Meteors.\r\n\r\n3. From the Eruptions of Vulcanoes and Earthquakes in distant Places,\r\nWinds may be propagated to remoter Countries.\r\n\r\n4. The divided or United Forces of the other Planets and of Comets, may\r\nvariously disturb the influence of the Sun and Moon, _&c._ We know that\r\nthere happen violent Tempests in the upper Regions of the Air, while we\r\nbelow enjoy a Calm; and how many Ridges of Mountains there are on our\r\nGlobe, which interrupt and check the Propagation of the Winds; so that\r\nit is no wonder that the Phænomena we have ascribed to the Action of the\r\nSun and Moon, are not always constant and uniform, and that every Effect\r\ndoes not hereupon follow; which, were there no other Powers in Nature\r\nable to alter the influence of this, might in a very regular and uniform\r\nmanner be expected from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese things being premised, it will not be difficult to shew (as was\r\nproposed in the first Place) that these Changes in our Atmosphere at\r\nHigh Water, New and Full Moon, the Æquinoxes, _&c._ must occasion some\r\nAlterations in all Animal Bodies; and that from the following\r\nConsiderations.\r\n\r\n1. All living Creatures require Air of a determined Gravity to perform\r\nRespiration easily, and with Advantage; for it is by its weight that\r\nthis Fluid insinuates it self into the Cavity of the Breast and Lungs.\r\nNow the Gravity, as we have proved, being lessened at these Seasons, a\r\nsmaller quantity only will insinuate it self, and this must be of\r\nsmaller force to comminute the Blood, and forward its Passage into the\r\nleft Ventricle of the Heart, whence a slower Circulation insues, and the\r\nSecretion of Spirits is diminished.\r\n\r\n2. This Effect will be the more sure, in that the Elasticity of the\r\nAtmosphere is likewise diminished. Animals want Air as heavy so Elastic\r\nto a certain degree; For as this is by its weight forced into the Cavity\r\nof the _Thorax_ in Inspiration, so the Muscles of the _Abdomen_ press it\r\ninto the _Bronchi_ in Expiration, where the bending force being somewhat\r\ntaken off, and Springy Bodies when unbended, exerting their Power every\r\nway, in Proportion to their Pressures, the Parts of the Air push against\r\nall the sides of the _Vesiculæ_, and promote the Passage of the Blood.\r\n\r\nWe have a convincing Instance of all this, in those who go to the top of\r\nhigh Mountains, for the Air is there so pure (as they call it) that is,\r\nwants so much of its Gravity and Elasticity, that they Breathe with very\r\ngreat difficulty.\r\n\r\n3. All the Fluids in Animals have in them a mixture of Elastic _Aura_,\r\nwhich when set at liberty, shews its Energy, and causes those\r\nFermentations we observe in the Blood and Spirits: Now when the Pressure\r\nof the Atmosphere, upon the Surface of our Body is diminished, the\r\ninward Air in the Vessels must necessarily be inabled to exert its\r\nForce, in Proportion to the lessening the Gravity and Elasticity of the\r\noutward; hereupon the Juices begin to ferment, change the Union and\r\nCohæsion of their Parts, break their Canals, _&c._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is very plain in living Creatures put into the Receiver, exhausted\r\nby the Air-Pump, which always swell as the Air is more and more drawn\r\nout; their Lungs at the same time contracting themselves, and falling so\r\ntogether as to be hardly discernible.[24]\r\n\r\nE're we proceed to Matters of Fact, it may be worth the while to take\r\nNotice, That Effects depending on such Causes as these, must of\r\nnecessity be most visible in Weak Bodies and Morbid Constitutions, when\r\nother Circumstances concur to their taking Place. For this reason,\r\nwhatever Mischiefs do hence follow, cannot in the least disparage the\r\nWise Contrivance of Infinite Power in ordering these Tides of our\r\nAtmosphere. The Author of Nature, we know, has made all things to the\r\ngreatest Advantage that could be, for the whole System of Animals on our\r\nGlobe, but it was impossible that such a disposition shou'd not in some\r\nCases be prejudicial to a Few. The Position and Distance of the Sun are\r\nso adjusted, as to give in the most beneficial manner possible, Heat and\r\nLight to the Earth; yet this notwithstanding, some Places may be too hot\r\nfor some weakly Bodies; some Autumns too sultry to agree with some\r\nAnimals, and some Winters too cold to be endured by some tender\r\nCreatures: The whole however we must own, is most carefully provided\r\nfor. Besides, as most of these last mentioned Inconveniencies are by\r\neasy shifts to be avoided; so there are such Powerful Checks put to this\r\nAereal Flux and Reflux, so many ways of abating the Damages accruing\r\nfrom it now and then; that these are of no account in comparison of the\r\nmighty Benefits hence arising, in which the Race of Mankind does\r\nuniversally share.\r\n\r\n[18] _Epist. ad Thessalum Filium._\r\n\r\n[19] Ὀυκ ἐλαχίστον μέρος συμβάλλεται Ἀστρονομίη εἰς Ἰητρικήν.

In some Cases a Point may perhaps be strained to serve a\r\ndarling Hypothesis which the Writer has taken up, but here we are much\r\nmore likely to have pure Matter of Fact, because hitherto no one has\r\npretended the Appearances of this kind to be within the Reach of any\r\nScheme of Philosophy.\r\n\r\nEpileptical Diseases besides the other Difficultys with which they are\r\nattended, have this also surprizing, that in some the Fits do constantly\r\nreturn every New and Full Moon; _the Moon_ (says Galen[25]) _governs the\r\nPeriods of Epileptic Cases_. Upon this score, They who were thus\r\naffected were called Σεληνιακοὶ[26] and in the Historys of the Gospel\r\nΣεληνιαζόμενοι[27] by some of the Latins afterwards, _Lunatici_[28].\r\n_Bartholin_[29] tells a Story of one Epileptic who had apparent Spots in\r\nher Face, which according to the Time of the Moon, varyed both their\r\nColour and Magnitude.\r\n\r\nBut no greater Consent in such Cases was perhaps ever Observed than what\r\nI saw some time since in a Child about 5 years old, in which the\r\nConvulsions were so strong and frequent, that life was almost despair'd\r\nof, and by Evacuations and other Medicines very difficultly saved. The\r\nGirl, who was of a lusty full habit of Body, continued well for a few\r\ndays, but was at Full Moon again seized with a most violent Fit, after\r\nwhich, the Disease kept its Periods constant and regular with the Tides;\r\nShe lay always Speechless during the whole time of Flood, and Recovered\r\nupon the Ebb. The Father who lives by the _Thames_ side, and does\r\nbusiness upon the River, observed these Returns to be so punctual, that\r\nnot only coming home He knew how the Child was before he saw it, but in\r\nthe night has risen to his Employ, being warned by Cries when coming out\r\nof her Fit, of the turning of the Water. This continued 14 days, that\r\nis, to the next great Change of the Moon, and then a dry Scab on the\r\nCrown of the Head, (the effect of an Epispastic Plaister, with which I\r\nhad covered the whole _Occiput_ in the beginning of the Illness) broke,\r\nand from the Sore, tho' there had been no sensible Discharge this way\r\nfor above a Fortnight, ran a considerable quantity of limpid Serum; upon\r\nwhich, the Fits returning no more, I took great care to promote this new\r\nEvacuation by proper Applications, with desired Success, for some time;\r\nand when it ceased, besides two or three Purges with _Mercurius Dulcis_,\r\n&c. ordered an Issue in the Neck, which being thought troublesome, was\r\nmade in the Arm; the Patient however has never since felt any Attacks of\r\nthose frightful Symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhether or no it be thro' want of due Heed and Enquiry that we have not\r\nin all the Collections of Histories and Cases, any Instance of the like\r\nNature so particular as this is, I know not; this is certain, that as\r\nthe _Vertigo_ is a Disease nearly related to the _Epilepsy_, and the\r\n_Hysterical Symptoms_ do partake of the same Nature; so both one and the\r\nother are frequently observed to obey the Lunar Influence. In like\r\nmanner, the raving Fits of Mad People, which keep Lunar Periods, are\r\ngenerally in some degree Epileptic too.\r\n\r\n_Tulpius_[30] and _Piso_[31] afford us remarkable Instances of\r\nPeriodical _Palseys_.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows how great a share the Moon has in forwarding those\r\nEvacuations of the weaker Sex, which have their Name from the constant\r\nRegularity they keep in their Returns; and there is no question to be\r\nmade, but the Correspondency we here observe, would be greater still,\r\nand even Universal, did not many Accidents, and the infinite Varieties\r\nin particular Constitutions one way or other concur to make a\r\ndifference. It is very observable that in Countries nearest to the\r\nÆquator, where we have proved the Lunar Action to be strongest; these\r\nMonthly Secretions are in much greater quantity than in those near the\r\nPoles, where this force is weakest. This _Hippocrates_[32] takes notice\r\nof, and gives it as one Reason why the Women in _Scythia_ are not very\r\nfruitful.\r\n\r\nThe Case being thus with Females, it is no wonder if we sometimes meet\r\nwith Periodical Hæmorrhages answering to the times of the Moon in Males\r\nalso. For as a greater quantity of Blood in proportion to the bulk in\r\n_one_ Sex, is the reason of its discharging it self thro' proper Ducts,\r\nat certain Intervals, when the pressure of the external Air being\r\ndiminish'd, the internal _Aura_ can exert its Elasticity; so in the\r\n_other_, if at any time there happens to be a Superabundancy of the same\r\nFluid, together with a weak Tone of the Fibres; it is plain that the\r\nVessels will be most easily burst, when the Resistance of the Atmosphere\r\nis least. And this more especially, if any accidental hurt, or rarefying\r\nForce has first given occasion to the other Causes to take effect.\r\n\r\nI know a Gentleman of a tender frame of Body, who having once, by over\r\nreaching, strained the parts about the Breast; fell thereupon into a\r\nspitting of Blood, which for a Year and half constantly return'd every\r\nNew Moon, and decreasing gradually, continued always 4 or 5 days. The\r\nFits being more or less considerable, according as his management about\r\nthat time, contributed to a greater or lesser fullness of the Vessels.\r\n\r\nWe have two notable Instances of the like nature in our Philosophical\r\nTransactions; the one[33] of a Person, who from his Infancy to the 24th\r\nYear of his Age, had every full Moon an Eruption of Blood on the right\r\nside of the Nail of his left Thumb, at first to 3 or 4 Ounces, and after\r\nhis sixteenth Year, to half a Pound each time; which when by searing the\r\npart with a hot Iron, he stopp'd, he fell into a _Sputum Sanguinis_, and\r\nby frequent Bleeding, _&c._ was very difficultly saved from a\r\nConsumption. The other[34] is a Story of an _Inn-Keeper_ in _Ireland_,\r\nwho from the 43rd Year of his Life, to the 55th (in which it killed him)\r\nsuffered a Periodical Evacuation at the point of the Fore-Finger of his\r\nRight-hand; and altho the Fits here kept not their returns so certain as\r\nin the forementioned Case, (it may be either from the irregular way of\r\nliving of the Patient, or the mighty change every Effusion made in his\r\nhabit of Body, the quantity seldom amounting to less than four Pounds at\r\na time) yet there is this remarkable Circumstance in the Relation, that\r\nthe first beginning of this _Hæmorrhage_ was at _Easter_, that is, the\r\nnext Full Moon after the Vernal Equinox, which is one of the two Seasons\r\nof the Year, at which we have proved the attraction of the Air, or\r\nlessening of its Pressure, to be greater than at any other time\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nBut we are besides this to consider, That the Static Chair, and nice\r\nObservation taught _Sanctorius_,[35] That _Men do increase a Pound or\r\ntwo in their weight every Month, which overplus is discharged at the\r\nMonths end, by a Crisis of copious, or thick turbid Urine_.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore at all strange that we should once a Month be liable\r\nto the returns of such Distempers as depend upon a Fullness of the\r\nVessels, that these should take place at those times especially, when\r\nthe ambient Air is least able to repress the Turgency; and that tho' New\r\nand Full Moon are both of equal Force, yet that sometimes one, and\r\nsometimes the other only should Influence the Periods, according as this\r\nor that happens to fall in with the inward Repletion.\r\n\r\nThe Afflux of Humours to Ulcers is sometimes manifestly altered by this\r\nPower; [36] _Baglivi_ was acquainted with a Learned Young Man at _Rome_,\r\nwho labour'd under a _Fistula_ in the _Abdomen_, penetrating to the\r\n_Colon_, which discharged so plentifully in the Increase, and so\r\nsparingly in the Decrease of the Moon, that he could make a very true\r\njudgment of the Periods and Quadratures of the Planet, from the\r\ndifferent quantity of the _Matter_ that came from Him.\r\n\r\n_Nephritic_ Paroxysms have frequently been observed to obey the Lunar\r\nAttraction: _Tulpius_[37] relates the Case of Mr. _Ainsworth_, an\r\n_English_ Minister at _Amsterdam_, who had a Fit of the Gravel and\r\nsuppression of Urine every Full Moon, of which he found no relief till\r\nthe Moon decreased, unless by Bleeding at the Arm. After his death two\r\nlarge Stones were taken out of his Bladder, and the _Pelvis_ of the left\r\nKidney was enlarged to that degree by the quantity of Urine so often\r\nstopt there, as to contain almost as much as the Bladder it self.\r\n\r\nI was present, not long since, at the Dissection of a Child about 5 or 6\r\nYear old, who dyed of the frequent returns of _Nephritic_ Fits, attended\r\nwith Vomitings and a _Diarrhæa_. The Kidneys and Ureters were quite\r\nstuffed with a slimy calculous Matter, and it was very instructive to\r\nsee the different degrees of Concretion in the several parts of it, from\r\na clear limpid Water, to a hard friable Substance. Dr. _Groenvelt_, who\r\nhad tended the Boy in his Illness, observed him to be seized with his\r\nPains at every Full Moon for several Months together, which generally\r\nended with the voiding of a Stone.\r\n\r\nWhat Influence the Moon has in _Asthma's_,[38] _van Helmont_ takes\r\nNotice, _Exacerbatur Paroxysmus_ (says he) _Lunæ Stationibus, & ævi\r\ntempestatibus quas ideo præsentit & præsagit_.[39] And Sir _John\r\nFloyer_, who has given us a more particular History of this Disease than\r\nany Author, observes, that _The Fits usually return once in a Fortnight,\r\nand frequently happen near the Change of the Moon_.\r\n\r\n'Tis a more uncommon Effect of this Attractive Power that is related by\r\nthe Learned _Kerckringius_.[40] He knew a Young Gentlewoman, whose\r\nBeauty depended upon the Lunar Force, insomuch that at Full Moon she was\r\nPlump and very Handsome, but in the decrease of the Planet so Wan and\r\nill Favoured, that she was asham'd to go abroad till the return of the\r\nNew Moon gave _Fullness_ to her Face, and _Attraction_ to her Charms.\r\n\r\nTho' this is indeed no more than an Influence of the same kind, with\r\nthat the Moon has always been observed to have upon Shell-Fish, and some\r\nother living Creatures. For as the old _Latin_ Poet _Lucilius_ says,[41]\r\n\r\n  _Luna alit Ostrea & implet Echinos, Muribu' fibras\r\n  Et Pecui addit---- ---- ----_\r\n\r\nAnd after him _Manilius_[42]\r\n\r\n  _Sic submersa fretris concharum & Carcere clausa,\r\n  Ad Lunæ motum variant animalia corpus._\r\n\r\nIt is very well worth the pains to enquire what share such an Alteration\r\nin the Weight and Pressure of the Atmosphere may have in the _Crises_ or\r\nChanges of Acute Diseases. The Ancients made great Account of _Critical_\r\nDays, and regulated their Practice according to the Expectation they had\r\nfrom them; This Part of Physick is grown now into disuse, quite\r\nslighted, and even ridiculed; and that I suppose chiefly for these two\r\nreasons. In the first place, because the earliest Observations of this\r\nkind, which were drawn into Rules being made in _Eastern_ Countries,\r\nwhen these came to be applied to the Distempers of _Northern_ Regions,\r\nwithout allowance given for the difference of the Climate, they were\r\noftentimes found not to answer. And secondly, Fevers of old were treated\r\nwith few or no Medicines, the Motions of Nature were carefully watched,\r\nand no Violence offer'd to interrupt her Work. The Histories therefore\r\nof _Crises_, tho' of great Use, and certainty under such Management as\r\nthis, were at length unavoidably set aside and lost; when Acute Cases\r\ncame to be Cured, according to this or that Hypothesis, not only by\r\nEvacuations, but hot or cold Alteratives too; there being no longer any\r\nroom for those Laws of Practice which supposed a regular and uniform\r\nProgress of the Distemper.\r\n\r\nWherefore, in order to understand a little both what might Induce the\r\nfirst Masters of our Profession to so nice and strict an Observance in\r\nthis point; and what grounds there may be now, for a more due regard to\r\ntheir Precepts, even upon the score of the Lunar Attraction only, I\r\npropose the following Remarks.\r\n\r\n1. All Epidemic Diseases do in their regular course require a stated\r\ntime, in which they come to their height, decline, and leave the Body\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nThis is so constant and certain, that when a Fever of any _Constitution_\r\nwhich is _continual_ in one Subject, happens from some other cause, in\r\nanother to be _intermitting_, the Paroxysms do always return so often as\r\nall together to make up just as many days of Illness as he suffers,\r\nwhose Distemper goes on from beginning to end, without any abatement.\r\n\r\nDr. _Sydenham_, a sworn Enemy to all Theories, learn'd thus much from\r\ndownright Observation; and gives this reason why Autumnal Quartans hold\r\nsix Months, because by computation the Fits of so long a time amount to\r\n336 hours, or 14 days, the period of a continual Fever of the same\r\nSeason.[43]\r\n\r\nSo _Galen_ takes notice that when an Exquisite Tertian is terminated in\r\nseven Paroxysms, a true Continual at the same time has its Crisis in\r\nseven days; that is, the Fever lasts as long in one as in the other, in\r\nas much (says he) as _a Fit in an Intermitting Feaver answers to a day\r\nin a Continual_[44]. Now this so comes to pass, because\r\n\r\n2. In these Cases there is always a Fermentation in the Blood, which\r\ngoes not off till the active Particles are thrown out by those Organs of\r\nSecretion, which, according to the Laws of Motion, are most fitted to\r\nseparate 'em. And\r\n\r\n3. As different Liquors put upon a Ferment, are depurated in different\r\ntimes, so the Arterial Fluid takes up a determined Period, of which it\r\nis discharged of an induced Effervescence.\r\n\r\n4. The Symptoms, during this Ebullition, do not proceed all along in the\r\nsame Tenour; but on some days particularly, they give such evident Marks\r\nof their good or bad Quality, that the nature of the ensuing _Solution_\r\nmay very well be guess'd at, and foretold by 'em.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings being thus, Those days on which the Disease was so evidently\r\nterminated one way or other, might very justly be call'd the days of\r\n_Crisis_; and those upon which the tendency of Illness was discovered by\r\nmost visible Tokens, the _Indices_ of the _Critical Days_.\r\n\r\nAnd thus far the Foundation was good, but when a false Theory happen'd\r\nunluckily to be joined to true Observations, this did a little puzzle\r\nthe Cause. _Hippocrates_, it is plain, knew not to what to ascribe that\r\nremarkable regularity with which he saw the Periods of Feavers were\r\nended on the _Seventh_, _Fourteenth_, _One and Twentieth_ day, _&c._\r\n_Pythagoras_ his Philosophy was in those Ages very Famous, of which\r\n_Harmony_ and the _Mysteries of Numbers_ made a considerable part, _Odd_\r\nwere more Powerful than _Even_, and _Seven_ was the most perfect of all.\r\nOur great Physician espoused these Notions,[45] and confined the Stages\r\nof acute Distempers to a _Septenary_ Progression[46], upon which this\r\nInconvenience follow'd, that when a Crisis fell out a day sooner or\r\nlater than this Computation required, his Measures were quite broken;\r\nand that this must necessarily oftentimes happen, will appear by and by.\r\n\r\nUpon this score _Asclepiades_ rejected this whole Doctrine as vain,[47]\r\nand _Celsus_ finding it to be too nice and scrupulous, observes that the\r\n_Pythagorean Numbers led the Ancients into the Error_.[48]\r\n\r\n_Galen_ being aware of this, succeeded much better in his reasoning upon\r\nthe Matter, and very happily imputed the Critical Changes not to the\r\nPower of Numbers, but to the Influence of the Moon; which he observes,\r\n_has a mighty Action upon our Earth, exceeding the other Planets, not in\r\nEnergy, but in Nearness_[49]. So that according to him, the Septenary\r\nPeriods in Diseases are owing to the _Quarterly Lunar Phases, which are\r\nthe times of the greatest Force, and which return in about seven\r\ndays_.[50]\r\n\r\nThe result of the whole Affair, in short is this, A _Crisis_ is no more\r\nthan the Expulsion of the Morbific Matter out of the Body, thro' some or\r\nother of the Secretory Organs; in order to which, it is necessary that\r\nthis should be prepar'd and comminuted to such a degree, as is required\r\nto make it pass into the Orifices of the respective Glands; and\r\ntherefore _as_ the most _perfect Crisis_ is by _Sweat_, (both by reason\r\nthat the Subcutaneous Glands do naturally discharge more than all the\r\nother put together, and also that their Ducts being the smallest of any,\r\nwhatsoever comes this way is certainly wery well divided and broken)\r\n_so_ the most _imperfect_ is an _Hæmorrhage_, because This is an\r\nArgument that what Offends is not fit to be cast off in any Part, and\r\nconsequently breaks the Vessels by the Effervescence of the Blood. An\r\n_Abscess_ in those Organs which separate thick, slimy Juices is of a\r\nmiddle nature betwixt these two.\r\n\r\nNow it is very plain, That if the time, in which either the Peccant\r\nHumour is prepar'd for Secretion, or the Fermentation of the Blood is\r\ncome to its height, falls in with those Changes in the Atmosphere which\r\ndiminish its pressure; the _Crisis_ will then be more compleat and\r\nlarge. And also, that this Work may be forwarded or delay'd a day, upon\r\nthe account of such an Alteration in the Air; the Distention of the\r\nVessels upon which it depends, being hereby made more easie, and a weak\r\nHabit of Body in some Cases standing in need of this outward Assistance.\r\nThus a Fever which requires about a Week to its Period, may sometimes,\r\nas _Hippocrates_ observed, have a good Crisis on the sixth, and\r\nsometimes not till the eighth day.\r\n\r\nIn Order therefore to make true Observations of this kind, the time of\r\nInvasion is to be considered, The genuine course of the Distemper must\r\nfirst be watched, which is not to be interrupted by any violent Methods:\r\nThe strength of Nature in the Patient is to be considered, and by what\r\nSecretions the Crisis is most likely to be performed; and it will then\r\nbe found, that not only the _New_ and _Full_ Moons, but even the\r\n_Southings_, whether visible or latent, of the Planet, are here of\r\nconsiderable Moment.\r\n\r\nFor Confirmation of which, we need only to reflect on what Mr. _Paschal_\r\nhas remark'd, _concerning the Motions of Diseases and Births and\r\nDeaths_[51]. Dividing the Νυχθήμερον into Four Senaries of Hours,\r\nthe first consists of three hours before the Southing of the Moon, and\r\nthree after; the second of the six hours following, and the third and\r\nfourth of the remaining Quarters of the natural day; He takes notice\r\nthat none are born, or die a natural Death in the first and third\r\nSenaries, which he calls first and second Tides, but all either in the\r\nsecond or fourth Senaries, which he calls first and second Ebbs. In like\r\nmanner, that in Agues, the tumult of the Fits generally lasts all the\r\nTiding time, and then goes off in kindly Sweats in the Ebbs. From whence\r\nhe very rationally concludes, that Motion, Vigour, Action, Strength,\r\n_&c._ appear most, and do best in the _Tiding Senaries_; and that Rest,\r\nRelaxation, Decay, Dissolution, _&c._ belong to the _Ebbing Senaries_.\r\n\r\n[25] Τας τῶν ἐπιλήπτων τηρεῖ περιόδους. _De Dieb.

Upon both which accounts its Action in raising\r\nthe Atmosphere must be great; And hence indeed the _Tides_ which\r\nfollowed were also very great, and the _Mercury_ in the _Barometer_, at\r\nleast, in most places, fell very low.\r\n\r\nThis Influence was, without all doubt, assisted by some such other\r\nCauses of _Winds_, as we have mentioned; These we can't know, but may\r\nhowever take notice how much the manifest State of the Air contributed\r\nto this Calamity.\r\n\r\nAfter a greater quantity of Rains than ordinary had fallen in the Summer\r\nand Autumn, in those places where the Storm was felt, the Winter came on\r\nmuch warmer than usual; so that the Liquor in a Thermometer, of which\r\nthe 84th Degree notes Frost, never fell below the 100th.[52]\r\n\r\nHence we may very well believe, that the Atmosphere was at that time\r\nfill'd with Atoms of _Salts_ and _Sulphur_, out of the Vapours raised by\r\nthe Heat from the moist Earth, which being variously combined and\r\nagitated, gave that deadly force to the Motion of the Air.\r\n\r\nA Proof of this we have not only from the frequent _Flashes_ of\r\n_Lightning_, observed a little before the Storm, but also from what the\r\nCountry People took notice of the next day, that the Grass and Twiggs of\r\nthe Trees, in Fields remote from the Sea, tasted very salt, so that the\r\nCattle wou'd not feed on them.\r\n\r\nOur Histories mention another Storm, which if not equal to this last in\r\nViolence, is however thought the greatest that had then ever been known\r\nand memorable from the time at which it happened, _viz._ on the 3d of\r\n_September_, 1658. the day on which the Usurper _O. Cromwel_ died.\r\n\r\nNo _Ephemerides_ that I know of relate the Condition of the Air that\r\nYear, but it is sufficient to remark, That whatever other Causes\r\nconcurr'd, their force was accompanied with a _Full Moon_, just before\r\nthe time of the _Atumnal Equinox_.\r\n\r\nUpon the same score it comes to pass, That in those Countries which are\r\nSubject to frequent _Inundations_, these Calamities are observed to\r\nhappen at the times of the _Moon_'s greatest Influence, so that the\r\nLearned _Baccius_[53] has rightly enough laid the Cause of such\r\nMischiefs upon immoderate _Tides of the Ocean_, being unhappily\r\naccompanied with the _attractive Force_ of some or other _Stars_.\r\n\r\nDr. _Childrey_ in his _Britannia Baconica_[54] has from several\r\nInstances shewn the _Lunar_ Action in Damages of this kind.\r\n\r\nSuch and the like _Natural_ Causes have _Storms_ and _Tempests_; for as\r\nto the Question of Divine Power, whether or no Calamities of this kind\r\ndo not sometimes, by the Anger of Heaven, happen out of the Course of\r\nNature, it is not my Business to Dispute, nor would I by any means\r\nindeavour to absolve Mens Minds from the Bands of Religion. For although\r\nwe must allow all the Parts of the Machine of this World to be framed\r\nand moved by Established Laws, and that the same Disposition of its\r\nFabrick, which is most beneficial to the Whole, must of necessity, in\r\nsome few Places now and then occasion Hurts and Mischiefs; it is however\r\nmost highly reasonable, that we should yield to the Supreme Creator an\r\nabsolute Power over all his Works; Concluding withal, that it was\r\nperhaps agreeable to Divine Wisdom, to order the Make of the World after\r\nsuch a manner as might sometimes bring Mischiefs and Calamities upon\r\nMankind, whom it was necessary by the Frights of _Storms_, _Thunder_ and\r\n_Lightning_ to keep in a continual Sence of their Duty.\r\n\r\n[52] _Vid._ Philos.
