BURTON N. GATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE SIXTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBOSTON:\r\n\r\nWRIGHT & POTTER PRINTING CO., STATE PRINTERS,\r\n\r\n32 DERNE STREET.\r\n\r\n1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPROVED BY\r\n\r\nTHE STATE BOARD OF PUBLICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOFT CANDY FOR BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE SO-CALLED \"FULLER CANDY\" FOR QUEEN CAGES, TRANSPORTATION OF\r\n    COMBLESS COLONIES, STIMULATIVE AND GENERAL FEEDING.\r\n\r\nThe well-informed beekeeper has learned that it is unwise and hazardous\r\nto feed under any circumstances honey in any form, even though it be\r\nfrom his own apiary. There have been many sad and general infections\r\nwith bee diseases by such unguarded feeding. Thus it has become almost\r\nan axiom, \"Feed no honey.\" Consequently, substitutes have necessarily\r\nbeen adopted and among these are sugar syrups of various dilutions and\r\ncompositions; \"hard candy,\" which is virtually a taffy; and recently,\r\nthe so-called \"Fuller candy,\" which is a soft fondant, not dissimilar to\r\nthe fondant of chocolate creams.\r\n\r\nFor several years Mr. Fuller of Blackstone, Mass., as well as others,\r\nhas been experimenting with this modified English candy, which should\r\nnot harden beyond usefulness. Beekeepers of Massachusetts and elsewhere\r\nabout the country have found it advantageous to use this as a substitute\r\nfor honey or syrup. So numerous are the inquiries and satisfactory the\r\nresults, that it seems desirable to prepare information in printed form.\r\n\r\nThe soft candy has numerous advantages and possibilities. It is found\r\nto be a most satisfactory stimulative feed; a food for bees in transit,\r\neither full colonies on combs, in combless packages, or for queens in\r\nmailing cages. It is also found satisfactory and advantageous as winter\r\nstores. Colonies have been observed to leave natural stores for the\r\ncandy. This has occurred in colonies out of doors or in the cellar\r\nduring winter, as well as with colonies which are flying. Some of the\r\nadvantages of the candy are the ease with which it is handled or\r\nsupplied; the fact that it may be made up in quantities and stored until\r\nneeded for use; its failure to excite robbing; the ability to provision\r\ncolonies with known amounts or weights; and its freedom from bee disease\r\ninfection. It is furthermore found to be economical, there being no\r\nwaste by evaporation or spilling, as is the case with liquid feeds. It\r\nis proving exceedingly practical in all feeding purposes and methods.\r\n\r\nThe candy may be made in any degree of hardness or softness, according\r\nto the preference of the individual or the needs of the season. As is\r\ninferred above, it may be made and stored for months and even years if\r\nproperly handled. It may be molded in pulp, or wooden pie-plates,\r\nshallow tins or specially constructed feeders (see Figs. 1 and 2),\r\n\"division-board feeders,\" overhead or super feeders, or boards may be\r\nnailed to the side of a frame and the candy poured and molded within the\r\nframe, allowing this to be hung in the hive adjacent to the cluster.\r\nWith the candy may be mixed pollen substitutes, but these are as yet in\r\nthe experimental stage, and their efficiency or satisfactoriness is\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nThe latest formula or recipe for the cream, or soft candy, fondant,\r\nwhich is practically a confectioner's recipe, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    12 pounds granulated sugar.\r\n\r\n    1-1/2 pounds liquid glucose.[1]\r\n\r\n    1-1/4 quarts water (equals 40 ounces, which equals 5 cupfuls).\r\n\r\n    1/4 teaspoonful (about) cream of tartar, added when the\r\n    temperature reaches about 230 deg. F. or 110 deg. C.\r\n\r\n    Boil to 238 deg. F. or 114.4 deg. C.\r\n\r\n  [1] Granular or crystal glucose may be used, mixing it with the\r\n  usual amount of water. It may be desirable to modify the amount of\r\n  glucose.\r\n\r\nThe measurements should be accurate.\r\n\r\nA wooden paddle whittled about a foot long, with a 2-inch blade, is\r\nfound to be superior to a spoon in stirring or beating the candy.\r\n\r\nA confectioner's thermometer is an advantage. Those experienced in\r\nmaking maple sugar may dispense with the thermometer, although more\r\naccurate results are obtained by using it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--These are the usual and convenient types of\r\ncandy box or feeder. The right-hand one is placed as it would appear on\r\nthe top of the frames. Notice that one end is slightly elevated. To its\r\nleft is a box of candy, which is darker, being made with \"Coffee A\"\r\nsugar; the glass side of this faces out, as also in the upper box. The\r\nbox at the extreme left shows the surface of white candy, made with\r\ngranulated sugar; it also shows the projection which tilts the box. Upon\r\nit is a pie plate filled with the candy, which may be inverted upon the\r\nframes. (Author's illustration.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Molds in the form of division-board feeders\r\n(left-hand mold filled with candy; right hand, empty). The lower frames\r\nare the standard Langstroth dimensions; the upper are Benton nuclei\r\nframes. The central box shows the position of a feeder on top of the\r\nframes. (Author's illustration.)]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sugar has begun to dissolve, _prior to boiling_, the\r\nspoon or paddle used in stirring should be removed from the kettle. _The\r\ncandy should not be stirred while cooking_; to do it will cause a coarse\r\ngrain. Remove from the stove and cool to 125 deg.-130 deg. F. (or 51.6 deg.-54.4 deg.\r\nC.), when the specified boiling point has been reached. While cooling,\r\nin order to equalize the temperature, the mass may be stirred; or\r\npreferably, when cooled to the specified degree, it should be stirred\r\nuntil it commences to grain. Mr. Fuller's directions are to stir\r\nvigorously until the mass appears in color and consistency like boiled\r\nstarch or paste. At once pour into molds or feeders and cool.\r\n\r\n_Fine-grain Fondant for Queen Cages._--Another way to cool the candy is\r\nto prepare a marble slab 2 or 3 feet square with bars of square iron,\r\nmaking a form. The candy may be poured upon the marble, and with broad\r\nputty knives, similar to those used by paper hangers, the mass may be\r\nbeaten or worked upon the marble. Experience teaches that this, which is\r\nvirtually a confectioner's method, produces a finer grain and usually a\r\nwhiter fondant than when stirred in the kettle. This is the process in\r\npreparing candy for use in queen mailing cages, or the transportation of\r\nbees. By it, a firmer consistency is usually obtained.\r\n\r\nAs a warning or explanation it may be said that the higher the\r\ntemperature at which the candy is boiled the harder it will become;\r\nconsequently, by varying the boiling point at which the candy is removed\r\nfrom the stove, the hardness or softness of the product may be governed.\r\nFurthermore, as is the experience of confection makers, candy should be\r\nboiled to one or two degrees higher on cloudy or humid days than on a\r\nclear, dry day. By means of a thermometer and a little experience, these\r\nfeatures are readily learned.\r\n\r\n_Storing the Candy._--The fondant is best stored in earthen crocks,\r\neither as a mass or in the feeders. These preserve the normal moisture.\r\nOver the mass should be placed a sheet of paraffin paper upon which is a\r\nmoist cloth or towel. The crock should be covered. Queen-cage candy\r\nshould always be kept in this way in order to preserve its consistency.\r\nSimilarly, candy molded in feeders may be stored in large crocks or\r\ntins.\r\n\r\n_Remaking the Candy._--If at any time the candy hardens from any cause,\r\neither in making, storage or in use, it may be softened by the\r\napplication of a few drops of water. Furthermore, it may be removed from\r\nthe molds and recooked to the desired consistency. To recook, add a\r\nsmall amount of water and boil as before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--When the bees of a strong colony eat up the\r\ncandy almost entirely, they not infrequently build combs, and have been\r\nknown even to rear brood, in the box. This shows (upper part of the\r\npicture, in corners) the remaining candy upon which the bees were still\r\nat work, also having attached combs to the glass. Some beekeepers have\r\nremoved such a box of combs and brood, starting there from a new colony.\r\nIn order to get the correct relation of the picture, hold it directly\r\nabove your head. The combs will then appear pendulous from the glass,\r\nand in their correct position, as if lifted off from the tops of the\r\nframes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Soft Candy for Bees, by Dr. Burton N.
