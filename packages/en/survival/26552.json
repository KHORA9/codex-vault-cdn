It is probably the result\r\nof many different causes, but, in the writer's opinion, it is due mainly\r\nto the fact that for years past the trend of population has been from\r\nthe country districts to the towns, with the result that many of the\r\ngreat centres of population are now very badly congested, and profitable\r\nemployment of any kind is often extremely difficult to obtain. The\r\ncongested towns offer no possible outlet for surplus labour, hence it is\r\nnecessary that such labour must find an outlet in the less thickly\r\npopulated parts of the world where there is still plenty of room for\r\ndevelopment and population is badly needed. Queensland is a country\r\npossessing these qualifications; but is, unfortunately, a country that\r\nis little known to the general mass of home-seekers, and, further, what\r\nlittle is known of it is usually so inaccurate that a very erroneous\r\nopinion of the capabilities of this really fine country exists. The\r\ngreat flow of emigration is naturally to those countries that are\r\nnearest to the Old World--viz., the United States of America and\r\nCanada--and little attention is given to Australia, although we have\r\nmany advantages not possessed by either the United States or Canada, and\r\nare not subject to the disadvantage of an intensely cold winter such as\r\nthat experienced throughout the greater portion of those countries for\r\nseveral months yearly.\r\n\r\nTo those looking for homes the following pages are addressed, so that\r\nbefore deciding to what part of the world they will go they may know\r\nwhat sort of a country Queensland really is, what one of its industries\r\nis like, the kind of life they may look forward to spending here, and\r\nthe possibility of their making a comfortable home amongst us. The life\r\nof a fruit-grower is by no means a hard one in Queensland, the climate\r\nof the fruit-growing districts is a healthy and by no means a trying\r\none, and is thoroughly adapted to the successful cultivation of many\r\nfruits; and, finally, a living can be made under conditions that are\r\nmuch more conducive to the well-being of our race than those existing in\r\nthe overcrowded centres of population. The writer has no wish to infer\r\nthat there are big profits to be made by growing fruit, but, at the same\r\ntime, he has no hesitation in saying that where the industry is\r\nconducted in an up-to-date manner, on business lines, a good living can\r\nbe made, and that there is a good opening for many who are now badly in\r\nwant of employment. The illustrations represent various phases of the\r\nindustry, and have been specially prepared by H. W. Mobsby, the Artist\r\nof the Intelligence and Tourist Bureau. Most of the Illustrations have\r\nbeen taken at an exceptionally dry time, and at the close of one of the\r\ncoldest winters on record, so that they do not show the crops or trees\r\nat their best; at the same time, they give a fair idea of some of our\r\nfruits, orchards, and fruit lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ALBERT H. BENSON.\r\n     Brisbane, Queensland, January, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueensland's greatest want to-day is population: Men and women to\r\ndevelop our great natural resources, to go out into our country\r\ndistricts as farmers, dairymen, or fruit-growers--not to stick in our\r\ntowns, but to become primary producers, workers, home-builders--not the\r\nscourings of big cities, the dissatisfied, the loafer, but the honest\r\nworker whose wish is to make a home for himself and his family. There\r\nare many such in the overcrowded cities of older countries, striving in\r\nvain to make a living--existing, it can hardly be called living, under\r\nconditions that are by no means conducive to their well-being--often\r\npoorly fed and poorly clad--who would better themselves by coming to\r\nQueensland, and by whom Queensland would be benefited. Queensland has\r\nroom for many such annually: men and women who come here for the express\r\nintention of settling amongst us and building homes for themselves; who\r\ncome here prepared to work, and, if needs be, to work hard; who do not\r\nexpect to become rich suddenly, but will be contented with a comfortable\r\nhome, a healthy life, and a moderate return for their labour--results\r\nthat are within the reach of all, and which compare more than favourably\r\nwith the conditions under which they are at present existing.\r\n\r\nQueensland's most valuable asset is her soil, and this requires\r\npopulation to develop it: soil that, in the different districts and\r\nclimates best adapted for their growth, is capable of producing most of\r\nthe cultivated crops of the world, and, with very few exceptions, all\r\nthe fruits of commercial value, many of them to a very high degree of\r\nperfection. This pamphlet is practically confined to the fruit-growing\r\npossibilities of Queensland, and an endeavour is made to show that there\r\nis a good opening for intending settlers in this branch of agriculture,\r\nbut the general remarks respecting the climate, rainfall, soils, &c.,\r\nwill be of equal interest to any who wish to take up any other branch,\r\nsuch as general farming, dairying, &c. The Queensland Department of\r\nAgriculture has received a number of inquiries from time to time, and\r\nfrom various parts of the world, respecting the possibilities of\r\nprofitable commercial fruit-growing in this State, and this pamphlet is\r\nintended in part to be an answer to such inquiries; but, at the same\r\ntime, it is hoped that it will have a wider scope, and give a general\r\nidea of one of our staple industries to many who are now on the look-out\r\nfor a country in which to settle and an occupation to take up when they\r\narrive there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Woombye, North Coast Railway. The centre of a large\r\nfruit growing district.]\r\n\r\nNo branch of agriculture has made a greater advance during the past\r\nquarter-century than that of fruit-growing, and none has become more\r\npopular. The demand for fruit of all kinds, whether fresh or preserved,\r\nhas increased enormously throughout the world, and it is now generally\r\nlooked upon more as a necessity than a luxury. Hence there are\r\ncontinually recurring inquiries as to the best place to start\r\nfruit-growing with a reasonable prospect of success. It is not only the\r\nincreased demand for fruit that causes these inquiries, but\r\nfruit-growing has a strong attraction for many would-be agriculturists\r\nas compared with general farming, dairying, or stock-raising, and this\r\nattraction is probably due to a certain fascination it possesses that\r\nonly those who have been intimately acquainted with the industry for\r\nyears can fully appreciate. In addition to the fact that living under\r\none's own vine and fig-tree is in itself a very pleasant ideal to look\r\nforward to, there is no branch of agronomy that calls for a keener\r\nappreciation of the laws of Nature, that brings man into closer touch\r\nwith Nature, that makes a greater demand on a man's patience, skill, and\r\nenergy, or in which science and practice are more closely related, than\r\nin that of fruit-growing. To all those who are considering the\r\nadvantages of taking up fruit-growing as an occupation, and to those who\r\nfeel the attraction I have just described, these few words on\r\nfruit-growing in Queensland are addressed, as the writer wishes them to\r\nlearn something of the fruit-growing capabilities of this State, so that\r\nbefore deciding on the country in which they will make a start they may\r\nnot be in complete ignorance of a land that is especially adapted for\r\nthe growth of a larger number of distinct varieties of fruit than any\r\nother similar area of land with which he is acquainted either in the Old\r\nor New World.\r\n\r\nQueensland is a country whose capabilities are at present comparatively\r\nunknown even to those living in the Southern States of Australia, and,\r\nnaturally, very much less so to the rest of the world, hence a little\r\ngeneral information respecting our country and one of its industries may\r\nbe of some help to those who are looking for an opening in this\r\nparticular branch of agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Tropical Orchard, Port Douglas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coochin York Mangosteen, Port Douglas District.]\r\n\r\nQueensland is a country having a population of a little over half a\r\nmillion, and an area of 429,120,000 acres; the population of a city of\r\nthe second magnitude, and an area of some seven and one-half times\r\ngreater than that of Great Britain, or two and one-half times greater\r\nthan the State of Texas, United States of America.\r\n\r\nA country embracing 18 degrees of latitude, from the 11th to the 29th\r\ndegrees of south latitude, and extending from a humid eastern seaboard\r\nto an extremely dry interior, some 15 degrees of longitude west. A\r\ncountry, therefore, of many climates and varied rainfall. A country\r\npossessing a great diversity of soils, many of which are of surprising\r\nrichness. A country more or less heavily timbered with either scrub or\r\nforest growth, or consisting of wide open plains that are practically\r\ntreeless. A country of infinite resources, that is capable of producing\r\nwithin its own borders all that man requires, from the extreme tropical\r\nto temperate products. A country that, once its possibilities are\r\nrealised and turned to a profitable account, is destined to become one\r\nof the most fruitful in the globe, to support a large and thriving\r\npopulation of our own people; and last, but not least, a country that,\r\nfrom a fruit-grower's point of view, cannot be excelled elsewhere. We\r\nhave a healthy climate, not by any means an extreme climate as is often\r\nrepresented--extreme cold is unknown, frost being unusual on any portion\r\nof the seaboard, but common during the winter months on our tablelands.\r\nBut even where there are frosts the days are pleasantly warm. Summer is\r\nundoubtedly warm, but it is usually a bearable heat, and sudden changes\r\nare extremely rare, so that though trying in the humid tropical\r\nseaboard, it is not unbearable, and compares favourably with the\r\ntropical heat met with elsewhere. This is clearly shown by the stamina\r\nof the white race, particularly those living in the country districts,\r\nwhere both men and women compare favourably with those of any other part\r\nof the Empire. Except in very isolated places, communication with the\r\noutside world and between the different centres of population is regular\r\nand frequent; in fact, in all the coastal and coastal tableland\r\ndistricts of the State one is kept daily in touch with all the important\r\nmatters that are taking place in the world. In the home life there is a\r\nfreedom not met with in older countries; there is an almost entire\r\nabsence of artificiality--people are natural, and are interested in each\r\nother's welfare. They are certainly fond of pleasure, but at the same\r\ntime are extremely generous and hospitable. The writer can speak of this\r\nfrom a large practical experience, as for some years past he has\r\nannually travelled many thousands of miles amongst fruit-growers and\r\nothers who are settled on the land, and, without exception, he has\r\neverywhere been met with the greatest kindness from rich and poor\r\nalike--in short, a hearty welcome--and the best that the house affords\r\nis the rule, without exception. In brief, should any of my readers\r\ndecide on coming to Queensland, the only difference that they will find\r\nas compared with the older countries is, that our climate is somewhat\r\nwarmer in summer, but to compensate for this we have no severe cold in\r\nwinter. There is more freedom and less conventionality, life to all who\r\nwill work is much easier, and there is not the same necessity for\r\nexpensive clothing or houses as exists in more rigorous climates. The\r\npeople they will meet are of their own colour and race, no doubt fond of\r\nsport and pleasure, perhaps inclined to be a little self-opinionated,\r\nbut solid grit at the bottom. As previously stated, Queensland offers\r\nexceptional advantages to the intending fruit-grower, and the following\r\nmay be quoted as examples. The ease with which fruit can be produced,\r\nwhen grown under conditions suitable to its proper development, is often\r\nremarkable, and is a constant source of wonder to all who have been\r\naccustomed to the comparatively slow growth of many of our commoner\r\nvarieties of fruits when grown in less favoured climes, and to the care\r\nthat is there necessary to produce profitable returns. Here all kinds of\r\ntree life is rapid, and fruit trees come into bearing much sooner than\r\nthey do in colder climates. In addition to their arriving at early\r\nmaturity, they are also, as a rule, heavy bearers, their fault, if\r\nanything, being towards over-bearing. Fruits of many kinds are so\r\nthoroughly acclimatised that it is by no means uncommon to find them\r\ngrowing wild, and holding their own in the midst of rank indigenous\r\nvegetation, without receiving the slightest care or attention. In some\r\ncases where cultivated fruits have been allowed to become wild, they\r\nhave become somewhat of a pest, and have kept down all other growths, so\r\nmuch so that it has been actually necessary to take steps to prevent\r\nthem from becoming a nuisance, so readily do they grow, and so rapidly\r\ndo they increase. The very ease with which fruit can be grown when\r\nplanted under conditions of soil and climate favourable to its\r\ndevelopment has had a tendency to make growers somewhat careless as\r\ncompared with those of other countries who have to grow fruit under\r\nconditions demanding the most careful attention in order to be made\r\nprofitable. This is enough to show that Queensland is adapted for\r\nfruit-growing, and the illustrations accompanying the description of our\r\nchief commercial fruits will show them more forcibly than any words of\r\nmine that my contention is a correct one. Latterly, however, there has\r\nbeen a considerable improvement in the working of our orchards, growers\r\nfinding that it does not pay to grow second-quality fruit, and,\r\ntherefore, they are giving much more attention to the selection of\r\nvarieties, cultivation of the land, pruning the trees, and the keeping\r\nin check of fruit pests; as, like other parts of the world, we have our\r\npests to deal with. This improvement in the care and management of our\r\norchards is resulting in a corresponding improvement in the quantity and\r\nquality of our output, so that now our commercial fruits--that is to\r\nsay, the fruits grown in commercial quantities--compare favourably with\r\nthe best types of similar fruits produced elsewhere. The writer has no\r\nwish to convey the impression that all that is required in order to grow\r\nfruit in Queensland is to secure suitable land, plant the trees, let\r\nNature do the rest, and when they come into bearing simply gather and\r\nmarket the fruit. This has been done in the past, and may be done again\r\nunder favourable conditions, but it is not the usual method adopted, nor\r\nis it to be recommended. Here, as elsewhere, the progressive\r\nfruit-growing of to-day has become practically a science, as the\r\nfruit-grower who wishes to keep abreast of the times depends largely on\r\nthe practical application of scientific knowledge for the successful\r\ncarrying on of his business. There is no branch of agronomy in which\r\nscience and practice are more closely connected than in that of\r\nfruit-growing. Every operation of the fruit-grower is, or should be,\r\ncarried out on scientific lines and by the best methods of\r\npropagation--pruning, cultivation, manuring, treatment of diseases, and\r\npreservation of fruit when grown are all, directly or indirectly, the\r\nresult of scientific research. To be a successful fruit-grower in\r\nQueensland one must therefore use one's brains as well as one's hands;\r\nthe right tree must be grown in the right kind of soil and under the\r\nright conditions; it must be properly attended to, and the fruit, when\r\ngrown, must be marketed in the best possible condition, whether same be\r\nas fresh fruit or dried, canned, or otherwise preserved, and whether\r\nsame be destined for our local, Australian, or oversea markets.\r\nFruit-growing on these lines is a success in Queensland to-day, and it\r\nis capable of considerable extension, so that, in the writer's opinion,\r\nit offers a good field for the intending settler. Carried out in the\r\nmanner indicated, he has no hesitation in saying that Queensland is a\r\ngood place in which to start fruit-growing, that the advantages it\r\npossesses cannot be surpassed or even equalled elsewhere, and, further,\r\nthat as our seasons are the opposite of those in countries situated on\r\nthe north of the equator, our fruits ripen in the off-seasons of similar\r\nfruit grown in those countries, and, with our facilities for cold\r\nstorage and rapid transit, can be placed on their markets at a time that\r\nthey are bare of such fruits, thus securing top prices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bunch of Fruit of the Coochin York Mangosteen.]\r\n\r\nQueensland has practically an unlimited area of land suitable for fruit\r\nculture, much of which is at present in its virgin state, and is\r\nobtainable on easy terms and at a low rate. Government land is worth on\r\nan average L1 per acre, and privately-owned land suitable for\r\nfruit-growing can be purchased at from 10s. to L5 per acre, according to\r\nits quality and its distance from railway or water carriage. We have\r\nplenty of land, what we lack is population to work it; and there is no\r\nfear of over-crowding for many years to come. We have not only large\r\nareas of good fruit land at reasonable rates, but the Government of\r\nQueensland, through its Department of Agriculture, is always ready to\r\ngive full information to intending settlers, to assist them in their\r\nselection of suitable land, to advise them as to the kinds of fruit to\r\nplant, to give practical advice in the cultivation, pruning, manuring,\r\nand general management of the orchard as well as in the disposal or\r\nutilisation of the fruit when grown; in short, to help the beginner to\r\nstart on the right lines, so that he will be successful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tamarind Fruits--Kamerunga State Nursery, Cairns.]\r\n\r\nThere is also little if any fear of over-extending the fruit-growing\r\nindustry, as, if it is conducted on the right lines and on sound\r\nbusiness principles, we can raise fruit of the highest quality at a\r\nprice that will enable us to compete in the markets of the world\r\nespecially now that we have direct and rapid communication at frequent\r\nintervals with Canada, the United States of America, the East (Japan,\r\nManilla, &c.), Europe, and the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEENSLAND FRUIT GROWING.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery few persons have any idea of the magnitude or the resources of this\r\nState of Queensland, and in no branch of agricultural industry are they\r\nmore clearly shown than in that of fruit-growing. Here, unlike the\r\ncolder parts of the world or the extreme tropics, we are not confined to\r\nthe growing of particular varieties of fruits, but, owing to our great\r\nextent of country, and its geographical distribution, we are able to\r\nproduce practically all the cultivated fruits of the world, many of them\r\nto great perfection. There are, however, one or two tropical fruits that\r\nare exceptions, such as the durien and mangosteen, whose range is\r\nextremely small, and one or two of the berry fruits of cold countries,\r\nwhich require a colder winter than that experienced in any part of this\r\nState. It will, however, be seen at once that a country that can produce\r\nsuch fruits as the mango, pineapple, banana, papaw, granadilla, guava,\r\ncustard apple, litchi, sour sop, cocoa nut, bread fruit, jack fruit,\r\nmonstera, alligator pear, and others of a purely tropical character; the\r\ndate, citrus fruits of all kinds, passion fruit, persimmon, olive, pecan\r\nnut, cape gooseberry, loquat, and other fruits of a semi-tropical\r\ncharacter, as well as the fruits of the more temperate regions, such as\r\nthe apple, pear, plum, peach, apricot, quince, almond, cherry, fig,\r\nwalnut, strawberry, mulberry, and others of minor importance, in\r\naddition to grapes of all kinds, both for wine and table, and of both\r\nEuropean and American origin, offers a very wide choice of fruits indeed\r\nto the prospective grower. Of course, it must not be thought for a\r\nmoment that all the fruits mentioned can be grown to perfection at any\r\none place in the State, as that would be an impossibility, but they can\r\nbe grown in some part of the State profitably and to great perfection.\r\n\r\nThe law of successful fruit culture is the same here as in all other\r\nfruit-producing countries--viz., to grow in your district only those\r\nfruits which are particularly adapted to your soil and climate, and to\r\nlet others grow those fruits which you cannot grow, but which their\r\nconditions allow them to produce to perfection. The intending grower\r\nmust, therefore, first decide on what fruits he wishes to grow, and when\r\nhe has done so, select the district best suited to their growth. The\r\nsmall map of the State shows the districts in which certain fruits may\r\nbe grown profitably, or, rather, the districts in which they are at\r\npresent being so grown; but there are many other districts in which\r\nfruit-growing has not been attempted in commercial quantities or for\r\nother than purely home consumption that, once the State begins to fill\r\nup with population, are equal, if not superior, to the older\r\nfruit-growing districts, and are capable of maintaining a large\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Typical Clean Orchard.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, the successful culture of fruit depends mainly on\r\nthe right kinds of fruit being grown in the right soil and climate. This\r\nnaturally brings us to the question of climate, and here one again gets\r\nan idea of the extent of our country, as we have not one but many\r\nclimates. Climate is a matter of such vital importance to fruit-growers,\r\nand there is such a general lack of knowledge respecting the climate of\r\nQueensland, that a little information on this point is desirable. I am\r\nafraid that there is a very general impression that Queensland has a\r\nclimate that is only suitable for a coloured race; that it is either in\r\nthe condition of a burnt-up desert or is being flooded out. That it is a\r\ncountry of droughts and floods, a country of extremes--in fact, a very\r\ndesirable place to live out of. No more erroneous idea was ever given\r\ncredence to, and, as an Englishman born, who has had many years'\r\npractical experience on the land in England, Scotland, the United States\r\nof America, and the various Australian States, I have no hesitation in\r\nsaying that, as far as my experience goes--and it is an experience\r\ngained by visiting nearly every part of the State that is suited for\r\nagricultural pursuits--taken as a whole, it is difficult to find a\r\nbetter or healthier climate in any other country of equal area. Our\r\nclimate has its disadvantages, no doubt, particularly our dry spells,\r\nbut show me the country that has a perfect climate. We have\r\ndisadvantages, but, at the same time, we have great advantages;\r\nadvantages that, in my opinion, outweigh our disadvantages.\r\n\r\nOur eastern seaboard, extending from the New South Wales border in the\r\nsouth, a few miles to the south of the 28th degree of south latitude, to\r\nCape York, some 20 miles north of the 11th degree of south latitude,\r\ncontains our best districts for the growth of tropical and semi-tropical\r\nfruits. The coastal climate, however, varies considerably, and is\r\ngoverned by the proximity or otherwise of the coast ranges. When they\r\napproach the coast there is always more rainfall, and as they recede the\r\nrainfall decreases. With one or two exceptions, where the coastal range\r\nis a considerable distance inland, the eastern coastal districts have a\r\nsufficient rainfall for the successful culture of most fruits, though\r\nthey are subject to a dry spell during winter and spring. During this\r\nperiod of the year, the weather is extremely enjoyable; in fact, it is\r\nhard to better it, even in our extreme North. But as summer approaches,\r\nthunderstorms become prevalent, and are accompanied by more or less\r\nhumid conditions, which, though good for fruit-development, are not\r\nquite so enjoyable as the drier months. Summer is our rainy season, and\r\nthe rainfalls are occasionally very heavy. The weather is warm and\r\noppressive, particularly in the more tropical districts; but these very\r\nconditions are those that are best suited to the production of tropical\r\nfruits. The climate of those districts having the heaviest summer\r\nrainfall is somewhat trying to Europeans, particularly women, but it is\r\nby no means unhealthy, and in the hottest parts, having the coast range\r\nnearly on the coast, there is, within a few miles, a tableland of from\r\n2,000 to 4,000 feet elevation, where the climate is cool and bracing,\r\nand where the jaded man or woman can soon throw off the feeling of\r\nlassitude brought about by the heat and humidity of the seaboard. In\r\nautumn the weather soon cools off, drier conditions supervene, and\r\nliving again becomes a pleasure in one of the best and healthiest\r\nclimates to be met with anywhere. Practically all the district under\r\nreview has a sufficient rainfall for the growth of all fruits suitable\r\nto the climate, though there are occasionally dry spells during spring,\r\nwhen a judicious watering would be a great advantage. This does not\r\nimply a regular system of irrigation, but simply the conserving of\r\nsurplus moisture in times of plenty by means of dams across small\r\nnatural watercourses or gullies, by tanks where such do not occur, or\r\nfrom wells where an available supply of underground water may be\r\nobtained. The water so conserved will only be needed occasionally, but\r\nit is an insurance against any possible loss or damage that might accrue\r\nto the trees during a dry spell of extra length. So far, little has been\r\ndone in coastal districts in conserving water for fruit-growing, the\r\nnatural rainfall being considered by many to be ample; but, in the\r\nwriter's opinion, it will be found to be a good investment, as it will\r\nbe the means of securing regular crops instead of an occasional partial\r\nfailure, due to lack of sufficient moisture during a critical period of\r\nthe tree's growth. The average yearly rainfall in the eastern seaboard\r\nvaries from 149 inches at Geraldton to 41 inches at Bowen, the mean\r\naverage being about 90 inches to the north and 49 inches to the south of\r\nTownsville. Were this fall evenly distributed throughout the year, it\r\nwould be ample for all requirements. Unfortunately, however, it is not\r\nevenly distributed, the heavy falls taking place during the summer\r\nmonths, so that there is often a dry spell of greater or less extent\r\nduring the winter and spring, during which a judicious watering has a\r\nvery beneficial effect on fruit trees, and secures a good crop for the\r\ncoming season. The rainfall shows that there is no fear of a shortage of\r\nwater at any time, the only question is to conserve the surplus for use\r\nduring a prolonged dry spell. These conditions are extremely favourable\r\nfor the growth of all tropical and semi-tropical fruits, as during our\r\nperiod of greater heat, when these fruits make their greatest call for\r\nmoisture, there is an abundance of rain, and during the other portions\r\nof the year, when the call is not so heavy, it is usually an inexpensive\r\nmatter to conserve or obtain a sufficient supply to keep the trees in\r\nthe best of order. Throughout the southern half of this seaboard frosts\r\nare not unknown on low-lying ground, but are extremely rare on the\r\nactual coast, or at an elevation of 300 to 400 feet above the sea, so\r\nmuch so that no precautions are necessary to prevent damage from frost.\r\nWe have, unlike Florida and other parts of the United States of\r\nAmerica--great fruit-growing districts--no killing frosts, and now, at\r\nthe close of one of the coldest winters on record, and one of the\r\ndriest, nowhere have our pineapples--fruit nor plants--been injured,\r\nexcept on low-lying ground, over in the Southern part of the State, and\r\nmangoes, bananas, &c., are uninjured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Burning-off for fruit growing, Mapleton, Blackall Range.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Same land one year later. Fruit-grower's family gathering\r\nstrawberries.]\r\n\r\nIn the more tropical North frosts are unknown on the coast, and there is\r\nno danger to even the most delicate plants from cold.\r\n\r\nRunning parallel with the coast we have a series of ranges of low\r\nmountains, running from 2,000 feet to nearly 6,000 feet, the general\r\nheight being from 2,000 to 3,000 feet, and at the back of these ranges\r\nmore or less level tablelands, sloping generally to the west. On and\r\nadjacent to these ranges in the Southern part of the State, there are\r\nfairly sharp frosts in winter, but the days are warm and bright. This is\r\nthe district best adapted for the growth of deciduous fruits and vines,\r\ntable varieties doing particularly well. It is a district well adapted\r\nfor mixed farming and dairying, as well as fruit-growing; the climate\r\nis even and healthy, and is neither severe in summer nor winter. The\r\naverage rainfall is some 30 inches, and is usually sufficient, though\r\nthere are dry periods, when a judicious watering, as recommended for the\r\ncoast districts, would be of great value to fruit and vegetable growers.\r\nThe more northern end of this tableland country has a much better\r\nrainfall--some 40 inches per annum--and frosts, though they occur at\r\ntimes, are not common. Here the climate is very healthy, there are no\r\nextremes of heat and cold, and, lying as it does inland from the most\r\ntrying portion of our tropical seaboard, it forms a natural sanatorium\r\nto this part of our State.\r\n\r\nFurther west the rainfall decreases, the summers are hot--a dry heat, as\r\ndistinct from the more humid heat of the coast, and much more bearable.\r\nThere are frequent frosts in winter, particularly in the Southern part\r\nof the State. Fruit-growing is only carried on to a slight extent at\r\npresent, and then only with the help of water, but when the latter is\r\nobtainable, very good results are obtained. Grapes do well, both wine\r\nand table, and for raisin-making. Citrus fruits are remarkably fine, the\r\nlemons especially, being the best grown in the State. The trees are less\r\nliable to the attack of many pests, the dryness of the air retarding\r\ntheir development, if not altogether preventing their occurrence. The\r\ndate palm is quite at home here, and when planted in deep sandy land,\r\nand supplied with sufficient water, it is a rapid grower and heavy\r\nbearer. As an offset to the smallness of the rainfall, there is a good\r\nsupply of artesian water, distributed over a wide range of country, that\r\ncan be obtained at a reasonable rate, and that is suitable for\r\nirrigation purposes. All bore water is not suitable for irrigation,\r\nhowever, as some of it is too highly mineralised, but there are large\r\nareas of country possessing an artesian supply of excellent quality for\r\nthis purpose. It will thus be seen that we have in Queensland, roughly,\r\nthree distinct belts of fruit-growing country--\r\n\r\n     1st.--The Eastern Seaboard, and the land adjacent to it, suitable\r\n     for the growing of tropical and semi-tropical fruit;\r\n\r\n     2nd.--The Coastal Tablelands, suitable for the growth of deciduous\r\n     fruits, vines, olives, and citrus fruits in parts;\r\n\r\n     3rd.--The Central Tablelands, suitable for the growth of grapes,\r\n     for table and drying, dates, citrus fruits, &c., but requiring\r\n     water for irrigation to produce profitably.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have confined my remarks mainly to the climatic side of\r\nfruit-growing, and, before dealing with the growing of the different\r\nkinds of fruit, I will say a few words about our fruit soils, and will\r\ndeal with them in districts, as I have endeavoured to do in the case of\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n1st.--Soils of Eastern Seaboard, and Land adjacent to it, suitable to\r\nthe Growth of Tropical and Semi-Tropical Fruit.\r\n\r\nSeveral distinct types of soil are found that are well adapted for\r\nfruit-growing, but they all have one general characteristic which is a\r\n_sine qua non_ of success--viz., they must possess good natural\r\ndrainage, so that there is no danger of their becoming waterlogged or\r\nsoured during periods of continued or heavy rainfall, as these\r\nconditions are fatal to fruit culture under tropical and semi-tropical\r\nconditions. Of such soils, the first to be considered are those of\r\nbasaltic origin. They are usually of a chocolate or rich red colour, are\r\nof great depth, in parts more or less covered with basaltic boulders, in\r\nothers entirely free from stones. The surface soil is friable and easily\r\nworked, and the subsoil, which is usually of a rich red colour, is\r\neasily penetrated by the roots of trees and plants grown thereon.\r\nOccasionally the subsoil is more compact, in which case it is not so\r\ngood for fruit-tree growth, but is better adapted for that of\r\nsugar-cane, corn, grass, &c. These basaltic soils are usually rich, and\r\nare covered in their virgin condition with what is termed scrub--a dense\r\nmass of vegetation closely resembling an Indian jungle. The scrub growth\r\nis totally distinct from forest growth, which will be described later,\r\nin that the bulk of the timber growing in it, much of which is of large\r\nsize, is of a soft nature, and once cut down soon rots away. Imagine a\r\ndense wall of vegetation, consisting of large trees running up to 100 or\r\n150 feet in height, with trunks ranging from 2 to 8 feet, or even more,\r\nin diameter, and between these trunks an impenetrable mass of smaller\r\ngrowths, all of the most vivid green colours, together with innumerable\r\nvines and creepers that are suspended from the branches of the trees,\r\nhanging in festoons, creeping palms and bamboos, ferns and orchids of\r\nmany kinds, both on the ground and growing on the tree trunks, as well\r\nas many beautiful foliage plants only found in hothouses in England, and\r\nyou will have a faint idea of what a virgin scrub in coastal Queensland\r\nis like. Much of the timber of the coastal scrubs is of considerable\r\ncommercial value for building purposes and furniture making, and is, or\r\nshould be, so utilised prior to felling and burning off.\r\n\r\nTrue scrub lands are not by any means the most difficult to clear,\r\nthough to a \"new chum\" the work will appear at first of a Herculean\r\ncharacter. Brushing the dense undergrowth and then felling the timber at\r\na face costs from L1 10s. to L2 per acre, according to density, size of\r\ntimber, and proportion of hardwood trees contained in it, and once this\r\nis done the fallen mass is allowed to become thoroughly dry, when it is\r\nburnt off. A good fire is half the battle, as the subsequent work of\r\nburning off the heavy timber left from the first burn is comparatively\r\nlight. No stumps are taken out, as the bulk are found to rot out in a\r\nfew years, and their presence in the soil is no detriment to the\r\nplanting of such crops as bananas or even citrus fruit trees. No special\r\npreparation of the land, such as breaking up, &c., is necessary prior to\r\nplanting. Holes are dug, trees or bananas are planted, and the whole\r\ncultivation for the first few years consists in keeping down weed\r\ngrowths with the chipping hoe. Once the stumps have rotted out the\r\nplough and other implements of culture take the place of the hoe. These\r\nsoils are especially adapted for the growth of oranges, limes,\r\nmandarins, mangoes, bananas, pineapples, papaws, custard apples,\r\nstrawberries, and cape gooseberries in the South; in fact, for nearly\r\nevery kind of tropical and semi-tropical fruit.\r\n\r\nSome basaltic soils are occasionally covered with forest in the place of\r\nscrub, or a mixture, part scrub and part forest. Forest country, as\r\ndistinct from scrub, is open-timbered country, with little undergrowth,\r\nand no vines or other creepers. The timbers are also, as a rule, very\r\nhard, and the stumps will not rot out. Such land, when at all heavily\r\ntimbered, is much harder to clear and get ready for fruit-growing than\r\ntrue scrub, as all timber must be felled and burnt off, and all stumps\r\nand roots taken out, so that the land can be thoroughly broken up and\r\nbrought into a good state of tilth prior to planting. These soils are\r\nsuitable to the growth of similar fruits to the true scrubs, but, as a\r\nrule, they are not as rich. The second class of soils suitable to\r\nfruit-growing are of alluvial origin, and are of a sandy, loamy nature,\r\nof fair depth. They are usually met with along our creeks and rivers, or\r\nin the deltas of our rivers. In their virgin state they are either\r\ncovered with scrub or forest, or a mixture of both, but the growth is\r\nseldom as strong as on the red volcanic soils. Heavy alluvial soils are\r\nnot suitable for fruit culture, and are much more valuable for the\r\ngrowth of farm crops, but the light sandy loams and free loams of medium\r\ncharacter suit all kinds of fruit to perfection. These soils usually are\r\neasy to work. They retain moisture well when well worked, and frequently\r\nthey are capable of being irrigated, either from adjacent creeks or\r\nrivers, or by water from wells. These soils are some of our best for\r\ncitrus fruits, and are well adapted for the growth of pineapples and\r\nbananas, as well as most other tropical fruits, when free from frosts.\r\nThe third class of soils are free sandy loams, either scrub or forest.\r\nThey are of various colours, and range in texture from light sandy loams\r\nto medium loams; they possess excellent drainage, and though, when\r\ncovered with forest, they are not naturally rich, they make excellent\r\nfruit soils, and respond rapidly to systematic cultivation and manuring.\r\nThey are usually of sandstone or granitic origin, and, when covered with\r\nscrub in the first place, grow good crops for the first few years, when\r\nthey become more or less exhausted in one or more available plant foods,\r\nand require manuring. These soils, like the sandy alluvial loams, are\r\neasy to work, retain moisture well when kept in a state of perfect\r\ntilth, and respond readily to manuring. They will grow all kinds of\r\nfruits when free from frost. There are other soils on which fruit can be\r\ngrown, but those mentioned represent those most suitable. The land on\r\nwhich these soils occur is often much broken, particularly in rich scrub\r\ncountry; it is fairly level when of alluvial origin, and more or less\r\nrolling, as a rule, when of a sandy loamy nature. High, ridgy, free,\r\nloamy country is usually the most free from frost, and alluvial flats\r\nthe most liable to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd.--Soils of the Coastal Tablelands, suitable for the Growth of\r\nDeciduous Fruit.\r\n\r\nStarting from the Southern part of the State, adjoining the New South\r\nWales border, the fruit soils are all of granitic origin. The country is\r\nmuch broken, but between the ridges and along the creek flats there is a\r\nconsiderable area possessing soils varying from a coarse, granitic,\r\ngritty soil to a fine granitic soil; that on the creeks of an alluvial\r\nnature, but still granitic. These soils vary considerably in quality,\r\nbut are, as a rule, easy to work and retain moisture well. They are\r\ncovered with open forest and are particularly adapted to the growth of\r\napples, plums, peaches, and grapes, though other deciduous fruits are\r\ngrown but not to the same excellence as those mentioned. Proceeding\r\nnorth the fruit soils are either sandy loams or loams of a brownish\r\ncolour of volcanic origin. The former are suitable for almonds and wine\r\ngrapes, and the latter for peaches, apricots, pears, apples, and\r\nespecially olives. Further north a few of these fruits may be grown on\r\nloamy soils, together with citrus fruits, but, commercially, deciduous\r\nfruits are confined to the southern end of this district, the winter\r\ntemperature being too high for their successful growth further north, as\r\nthe trees get no winter rest, hence do not mature their fruit-bearing\r\nwood properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n3rd.--Soils of the Central Tablelands, suitable to the Growth of Grapes,\r\nDates, Citrus Fruits, Etc.\r\n\r\nAt the Southern end of the State the fruit soils are all of a sandy\r\nnature. Nothing else is used in any quantity, as sandy soils alone will\r\nretain sufficient moisture for the growth of grapes and fruit trees\r\nduring dry spells, and even then only when kept well and deeply worked.\r\nFurther north, where suitable artesian water is available, the best\r\nfruit soils are also free loams of a sandy nature, either alluvial or\r\nopen forest soils, but deep, and possessing perfect drainage, as\r\nirrigation on land without good natural drainage is fatal to fruit\r\nculture. These sandy loams are also easy to work; though by no means\r\nrich, they, on account of their depth, grow good crops of fruit by means\r\nof irrigation, and the fruit, such as dates, oranges, lemons, grapes,\r\n&c., is of very fine quality. The fruit soils of this district are\r\ncovered either with open forest--the trees being of comparatively small\r\nsize--or with a scrubby undergrowth through which a few larger trees are\r\nscattered. Nearly all the timber of this district is extremely hard, is\r\nmore or less stunted, and burns readily, hence clearing is not a very\r\nexpensive item.\r\n\r\nHaving now given a very brief description of our climate and the\r\nfruit-soils in our principal fruit-producing centres, we will next\r\nconsider the culture of those fruits which are grown in commercial\r\nquantities in the different parts of the State, as well as that of a few\r\nless well-known fruits which show especial promise. We will first deal\r\nwith our tropical fruits, of which the first to be considered is the\r\nbanana, as its production greatly exceeds that of any other tropical\r\nfruit, and, as far as Australia is concerned, this is the only State in\r\nwhich it is grown in commercial quantities. From tropical fruits we will\r\ngo on to semi-tropical fruits, then to temperate fruits and vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANANA.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of \"Banana,\" all kinds of plantains will also be\r\nincluded, as they belong to one and the same family. The members of this\r\nfamily of plants are all tropical, and produce the most typical and best\r\nknown tropical fruits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cavendish Bananas on scrub land, Buderim Mountain.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cavendish Bananas at Woombye on newly cleared land.]\r\n\r\nThe rank luxuriance of the growth of this class of fruits, their\r\nhandsome foliage, their productiveness, their high economic value as\r\nfood, and their universal distribution throughout the tropics, all\r\ncombine to place them in a premier position. As a food it is unequalled\r\namongst fruits, as no matter whether it is used green as a vegetable,\r\nripe as a fruit, dried and ground into flour, or preserved in any other\r\nway, it is one of the most wholesome and nutritious of foods for human\r\nconsumption. It is a staple article of diet in all tropical countries,\r\nand the stems of several varieties make an excellent food for all kinds\r\nof stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Twenty-dozen Bunch, Buderim Mountain.]\r\n\r\nIn Queensland, the culture of bananas is confined to the frostless belts\r\nof the eastern seaboard, as it is a plant that is extremely susceptible\r\nto cold, and is injured by the lightest frosts. It is grown in\r\nfavourable locations in the South, where it produces excellent fruit,\r\nbut its cultivation is much greater in the North, where the rainfall is\r\nheavier and the average annual temperature greater. In the Southern part\r\nof the State its cultivation is entirely in the hands of white growers,\r\nwho have been growing it on suitable soil in suitable localities for the\r\npast fifty years or even more. I recently saw an old plantation that was\r\nset out over twenty years ago, and the present plants are still strong\r\nand healthy, and bearing good bunches of well-filled fruit, so that\r\nthere is no question as to the suitability of the soil or climate.\r\nBananas do best on rich scrub land, and it is no detriment to their\r\ngrowth if it is more or less covered with stones as long as there is\r\nsufficient soil to set the young plants. Shelter from heavy or cold\r\nwinds is an advantage, and the plants thrive better under these\r\nconditions than when planted in more exposed positions. Bananas are\r\nfrequently the first crop planted in newly burnt off scrub land, as they\r\ndo not require any special preparation of such land, and the large\r\namount of ash and partially burnt and decomposed vegetable mould provide\r\nan ample supply of food for the plants' use. Bananas are rank feeders,\r\nso that this abundance of available plant food causes a rapid growth,\r\nfine plants, and correspondingly large bunches of fruit. Though newly\r\nburnt off scrub land is the best for this fruit, it can be grown\r\nsuccessfully in land that has been under cultivation for many years,\r\nprovided that the land is rich enough naturally, or its fertility is\r\nmaintained by judicious green and other manuring. In newly burnt off\r\nscrub land all that is necessary is, to dig holes 15 to 18 inches in\r\ndiameter, and about 2 feet deep, set the young plants in it, and partly\r\nfill in the hole with good top soil. The young plant, which consists of\r\na sucker taken from an older plant, will soon take root and grow rapidly\r\nunder favourable conditions, producing its first bunch in from ten to\r\ntwelve months after planting. At the same time that it is producing its\r\nfirst bunch it will send up two or more suckers at the base of the\r\nparent plant, and these in turn will bear fruit, and so on. After\r\nbearing, the stalk that has produced the bunch of fruit is cut down; if\r\nthis is not done it will die down, as its work has been completed, and\r\nother suckers take its place. Too many suckers should not be allowed to\r\ngrow or the plants will become too crowded, and be consequently stunted\r\nand produce small bunches. All the cultivation that is necessary is the\r\nkeeping down of weed growth, and this, once the plants occupy the whole\r\nof the land, is not a hard matter. A plantation is at its best when\r\nabout three years old, but remains profitable for six years or longer;\r\nin fact, there are many plantations still bearing good fruit that have\r\nbeen planted from twelve to twenty years. Small-growing or dwarf kinds,\r\nsuch as the Cavendish variety, are planted at from 12 to 16 feet apart\r\neach way, but large-growing bananas, such as the Sugar and Lady's\r\nFinger, require from 20 to 25 feet apart each way, as do the\r\nstronger-growing varieties of plantain. Plantains are not grown to any\r\nextent in Queensland, and our principal varieties are those already\r\nmentioned, the Cavendish variety greatly predominating. In the North,\r\nthe cultivation of this latter variety is carried out on an extensive\r\nscale, principally by Chinese gardeners, who send the bulk of their\r\nproduce to the Southern States of the Commonwealth. The industry\r\nsupports a large number of persons other than the actual producers of\r\nthe fruit, and forms one of our principal articles of export from the\r\nNorth. As many as 20,000 or more large bunches of bananas frequently\r\nleave by a single steamer for the South, and the bringing of this\r\nquantity to the port of shipment gives employment to a number of men on\r\ntram lines and small coastal steamers. The shipment of a heavy cargo of\r\nbananas presents a very busy scene that is not soon forgotten, the\r\nthousands of bunches of fruit that are either piled up on the wharf or\r\nthat are being unloaded from railway trucks, small steamers or sometimes\r\nChinese junks, forming such a mass of fruit that one often wonders how\r\nit is possible to consume it all before it becomes over-ripe. Still, it\r\nis consumed, or, at any rate, the greater portion of it is, as it is the\r\nuniversal fruit of the less wealthy portion of the community, the price\r\nat which it can be sold being so low that it is within the reach of\r\neveryone. A banana garden in full bearing is a very pretty sight, the\r\nthousands of plants, each with their one or more bunches of fruit, as,\r\nwhere there are several stems it is not at all uncommon to find two or\r\nmore bunches of fruit in different states of development on the same\r\nplant, forming a mass of vegetation that must be seen to be appreciated.\r\nThis is the case even with dwarf-growing kinds, but with strong-growing\r\nvarieties, such as the Lady's Finger, the growth is so excessive that\r\nthe wonder is, how the soil can support it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bananas for shipment at Innisfail.]\r\n\r\nBananas do remarkably well in Queensland, and there is practically an\r\nunlimited area of country suitable for their culture, much of which is\r\nat present in a state of Nature. Only the more easily accessible lands\r\nhave been worked and of these only the richest. Manuring is unknown in\r\nmost parts, and as soon as the plantation shows signs of deterioration\r\nit is abandoned, and a fresh one planted out in new land, the land\r\npreviously under crop with bananas being either planted in sugar-cane or\r\nallowed to run to grass. This is certainly a very wasteful method of\r\nutilising our land, and the time will come, sooner or later, when\r\ngreater care will have to be given to it, and that once land has become\r\nimpoverished by banana culture, it will have to be put under a suitable\r\nrotation of crops, so as to fit it for being again planted to bananas.\r\nThe trouble is, as I have already stated, we have too much land and too\r\nfew people to work it, hence, so far, we are unable to use it to\r\nanything like the best advantage. During the year 1904 the production of\r\nbananas in Queensland was some 2,000,000 bunches, and when it is\r\nconsidered that each bunch will average about 12 dozen fruit, it will be\r\nseen that already we are producing a very large quantity. There is,\r\nhowever, plenty of room for extension, and any quantity of available\r\ncountry, but before this extension can be profitable, steps will have to\r\nbe taken to utilise the fruit in a manner other than its consumption as\r\nfresh fruit, and this in itself will mean the opening up of new\r\nindustries and the employment of a considerable amount of labour. I have\r\nmentioned 12 dozen as being the average quantity of fruit per bunch, but\r\nit is frequently much more than this, and I have often seen bunches of\r\n25 to 30 dozen fine fruit grown on strong young plants on rich new land.\r\nAlthough the industry in the North is now almost entirely in the hands\r\nof Chinese gardeners, there is no reason whatever why it should not be\r\nrun by white growers, as is done in the South, and there is no question\r\nthat our white-grown bananas in the South compare more than favourably\r\nwith the Northern Chinese-grown article, despite the fact that the\r\nlatter has every advantage in climate and an abundance of virgin soil.\r\nMost of the photos of bananas are, I am sorry to say, not by any means\r\ntypical of this industry, as they have been taken during the off-season,\r\nwhen the plants look ragged and are showing little new growth, and the\r\nbunches also are much smaller than usual. Still, I hope that the\r\nillustrations will give some idea of the growing and handling of this\r\ncrop, and will show what a banana plant and its bunch are like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PINEAPPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is one fruit that Queensland can grow to perfection, it is\r\nundoubtedly the pineapple. This is not merely my own personal opinion,\r\nbut is the universal admission of all who are qualified to judge. On\r\nmany occasions I have taken men thoroughly conversant with\r\npineapple-growing, and who knew what a good fruit really is, through\r\nsome of our plantations, where I have given them fruit to test, and,\r\nwithout exception, they have had no hesitation in saying that they have\r\nnever tasted better fruit. Our fruit has a firmness, freedom from fibre,\r\nand a flavour that is hard to beat. It is an excellent canning fruit,\r\nsuperior in this respect to the Singapore article, which it surpasses in\r\nflavour. This is admitted by English and European buyers, and its\r\nsuperiority is bound eventually to result in a great increase in canning\r\nand the establishment of large works run on thoroughly up-to-date\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Picking Pines for market--Woombye District.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pineapple Plantation--showing plants of different\r\nages--Woombye, North Coast Line.]\r\n\r\nLike the banana, the pineapple is a tropical fruit, and is very\r\nsensitive to cold, hence its culture is confined to frostless districts.\r\nIt is grown all along our eastern seaboard, where, when planted in\r\nsuitable soils and under suitable conditions, it is, undoubtedly, our\r\nhardiest fruit, and is practically immune from any serious disease. Its\r\nculture is entirely in the open, no shelter whatever being given, so\r\nthat we are not put to the great expense that growers of this fruit in\r\nFlorida and some other pineapple-producing countries must incur if they\r\nwish to secure a crop. Here we have no severe freeze-outs, and, though\r\ndry spells retard the growth at times, we have never suffered any\r\nserious injury from this cause. In the Southern part of the State, the\r\ncoolness of the winter retards growth somewhat, and occasionally the\r\ntops of the leaves and young fruit are slightly injured, particularly in\r\nlow-lying land, or where the plants are growing on land having a cold\r\nsubsoil. When grown under more favourable conditions, however, they\r\nsustain no injury, and produce fruit, more or less, all the year round.\r\nPines are always in season, though there are times when they are\r\ncomparatively scarce. There are usually two main crops a year--viz., a\r\nsummer and a winter crop. The former is the heavier of the two, and the\r\nfruit is decidedly the best, as its sugar contents are much higher. The\r\nmain summer crop ripens in the North from the beginning of November, and\r\nin the South from January to as late as March in some seasons. The main\r\nwinter crop is usually at its best in July and August, but there is\r\nalways more or less fruit during the other months of the year. The\r\npineapple likes a warm, free, well-drained soil, that is free from frost\r\nin winter, and that will not become soured by heavy rain during summer.\r\nSandy loams are, therefore, our best pineapple soils, though it does\r\nwell on free loams of basaltic or alluvial origin. Unlike the banana,\r\nthe pineapple does not do too well in newly burnt off scrub land, owing\r\nto the difficulty in working the ground and keeping it clean. It\r\nrequires a thorough preparation of the soil prior to planting in order\r\nto be grown to perfection. In the case of new land of suitable texture,\r\nthe timber should all be burnt off, and all stumps and roots taken out\r\nof the soil, which should then be carefully broken up and reduced to a\r\nfine tilth, all weed or grass growth being destroyed. It should then be\r\nagain ploughed, and, if possible, subsoiled, so as to permit of the\r\nroots penetrating the ground to a fair depth instead of their merely\r\ndepending on the few top inches of surface soil. Careful preparation of\r\nthe land and deep stirring prior to planting will be found to pay well,\r\nand turn out far the cheapest in the end. Given suitable soil, well\r\nprepared, the growing of pineapples is not at all difficult, as the\r\nplants soon take root, and once they became established, they prove\r\nthemselves to be extremely hardy. Pines will grow and thrive on\r\ncomparatively poor soil, provided it is of suitable texture, but in such\r\nsoils it is necessary to supplement the plant food in the soil by the\r\naddition of manures, if large fruit and heavy crops are to be obtained.\r\nPineapples are propagated by means of suckers coming from the base of\r\nfruit-bearing plants, or from smaller suckers, or, as they are termed,\r\nrobbers or gill sprouts that start from the fruiting stem just at the\r\nbase of the fruit. They are also sometimes propagated by means of the\r\ncrown, but this method is usually considered too slow. Well-developed\r\nsuckers are usually preferred, as these come into bearing earliest, but\r\nequally good, if not better, returns are obtained by planting gill\r\nsprouts. The latter have the advantage in that they always develop a\r\ngood root system before showing signs of fruit, hence their first crop\r\nis always a good one, and the fruit is of the best, whereas suckers\r\nsometimes start flowering as soon as they are planted, before they are\r\nproperly established, with the result that the first fruit is small and\r\ninferior, and the plants have to throw out fresh suckers before a good\r\ncrop is produced. Gill sprouts are slower in coming into bearing than\r\nsuckers, but the results are usually more satisfactory. Like the banana,\r\nonce a pineapple plant has borne fruit the fruiting stalk dies down, and\r\nits place is taken by one or more suckers, which in their turn bear\r\nfruit and die. Pineapples are planted in Queensland in several ways, but\r\nby far the most common method is to set the suckers out in single or\r\ndouble rows, from 8 to 9 feet apart, with the plants at from 1 to 2 feet\r\napart in the row. The rows soon increase in width by the growth of\r\nsuckers, and the throwing up of ratoons--surface roots thrown off from\r\nthe original plant, which send up plants from below the ground as\r\ndistinct from suckers, which come from the base or even higher up the\r\nstem of a fruiting plant. It is not at all an uncommon thing to see the\r\nrows grown together, so that the plantation appears to be a solid mass\r\nof plants, but pathways have to be kept between the rows to permit of\r\ngathering the fruit, manuring, &c. Pineapples have been grown in the\r\nBrisbane district for the past sixty years, and I have been shown beds\r\nof plants that have not been replanted for over forty years that are\r\nstill producing good fruit. This shows how well at home this fruit is\r\nwith us; but, in my opinion, it is not desirable to keep the plants so\r\nlong in the same ground, as the finest fruit is always obtained from\r\ncomparatively young plantations, the older ones producing too large a\r\nproportion of small fruit. From the Brisbane district this fruit has\r\nspread all over the eastern coast, and its production is increasing\r\nrapidly in several districts. Once the pine is planted, its cultivation\r\nis comparatively simple. If in single or double rows, all weed growth is\r\nkept down between the plants, and the ground between the rows is kept in\r\na state of good cultivation by means of ploughing or cultivating, the\r\nsoil being worked towards the rows so as to encourage the formation of\r\nsuckers low down on the fruiting plants. Manure is given when necessary,\r\nthe manure being worked in on either side of the rows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Smooth-leaved Cayenne Pines in fruit, planted 15 months,\r\nWoombye District.]\r\n\r\nThe pineapple comes into bearing early, and, except where suckers throw\r\nfruit as soon as planted, bear their first crop in from twelve to twenty\r\nmonths, according to the type of suckers planted and the time of year at\r\nwhich they are set. Practically every sucker will produce a fruit at the\r\nfirst fruiting, and these will be followed by succeeding crops, borne on\r\nthe successive crops of suckers, so that when the whole of the ground is\r\noccupied by plants, the returns are very heavy. One thousand dozen\r\nmarketable fruits is by no means an unusual crop for Queen pines in a\r\nplantation in full bearing, and, taking these at an average of 2-1/2 lb.\r\neach, you get a return of 30,000 lb., or 15 tons American per acre. The\r\nillustrations herewith give a good general idea of the usual method of\r\ngrowing pines, and the method of handling and marketing, as well as of\r\nthe nature of the country on which they are grown. The illustrations\r\nare mostly of smooth-leaved pines, which bear a fruit averaging from 6\r\nto 8 lb. each, but occasionally running up to as much as 14 to 16 lb.,\r\nthough the latter is an extreme weight. The single pine shown is just\r\nunder 12 lb. Several kinds of pines are grown, which are generally\r\nclassified into roughs and smooths. The rough, or rough-leaved pines,\r\nsuch as the Common Queen and Ripley Queen, and local seedlings raised\r\nfrom them, are very prolific, and though not equal in size and\r\nappearance to the smooth-leaved Cayenne, our principal smooth-leaved\r\nkind, are usually considered to be of superior flavour, and to be better\r\nfor canning or preserving. Rough pines run up to as much as 6 lb. weight\r\neach, but this is uncommon, the best average I have met with being about\r\n4 lb. per pine, and they were exceptionally good. The price at which\r\nthis fruit sells here seems absurd to those living in cold countries,\r\nwho are accustomed to look upon it as a luxury only found on the tables\r\nof the wealthy, as good rough-leaved pines are worth about 1s. per dozen\r\nduring the summer season, and smooth-leaved pines from 1s. 6d. to 2s.\r\n6d. a dozen. Prices are certainly higher during the off-season, but\r\ngrowers would be well satisfied to get 1s. per dozen for rough pines all\r\nthe year round. I have no hesitation in saying that pines can be grown\r\nat a profit at from L3 to L4 per ton, so that the cost of growing is so\r\nlow that there is nothing to prevent us from canning the fruit and\r\nselling it at a price that will defy competition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pineapple Plantation--Pines packed for market, and\r\nshowing fruit-grower's home, Woombye District.]\r\n\r\nPineapple-growing has been a very profitable industry, particularly in\r\nthe older plantations of the Brisbane district, and still continues to\r\nbe so in many places despite the fact that prices are much lower now\r\nthan they were some years since. The plantations from which the\r\nillustrations are taken are comparatively new ones, the land having been\r\nin its virgin state from six to eight years ago, and, as shown, some is\r\nonly now being cleared. The owners of the plantations started without\r\ncapital, and, by dint of hard work and perseverance, are now reaping an\r\nexcellent return of some L50 per acre net profit. This is by no means an\r\nisolated example, but is one that is typical of what can be done, and\r\nhas therefore been chosen. There is a great opening for the culture of\r\nthis fruit in Queensland, and its cultivation is capable of being\r\nextended to a practically unlimited extent. We have a large amount of\r\nland suitable for the growth of this fruit that is available in\r\ndifferent parts of the State, much of it at very reasonable rates, so\r\nthat there is no difficulty in this direction for anyone wishing to make\r\na start. It is an industry from which returns are quickly obtained, and\r\nis a branch of fruit-growing that holds out strong inducements and every\r\nprospect of success to intending growers. At present our production is\r\nabout sufficient for our presently existing markets, but there is\r\nnothing to prevent these markets being widely extended. Our present\r\nmeans of utilising our surplus fruits, by canning or otherwise\r\npreserving same, are by no means as complete or up to date as they\r\nshould be, and before they can become so, it is necessary to greatly\r\nincrease our output. Small works cost too much to run as compared with\r\nlarge canning establishments, hence we are not yet in a position to make\r\nthe most of our fruit. With increased production we will have an\r\nincrease in the facilities for utilising the fruit. This requires\r\nlabour, and there is right here an opening for many industrious\r\nworkers, a business that I have no doubt will pay from the start, a\r\nbusiness of which we have the Australian monopoly, and in which there is\r\nno reason that I can see in which we should not compete satisfactorily\r\nin the markets of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pineapple Plantation--Showing method of growing the\r\nfruit, Woombye District.]\r\n\r\nQueensland possesses many advantages respecting the growth of this fruit\r\nas compared with other countries in which it is grown commercially,\r\nwhich may be briefly enumerated as follows:--\r\n\r\n     1st.--Freedom from loss by freeze-outs;\r\n\r\n     2nd.--The ease with which the fruit can be grown, and its freedom\r\n     from disease;\r\n\r\n     3rd.--The large area of land suitable to its culture, and the low\r\n     price at which suitable land can be obtained;\r\n\r\n     4th.--The fine quality of the fruit;\r\n\r\n     5th.--The superiority of our fruit for canning purposes;\r\n\r\n     6th.--The low price at which it can be produced, and the heavy\r\n     crops that can be grown.\r\n\r\nThese are enough reasons to show that in the pineapple we have a fruit\r\nwell suited to our soil and climate, a fruit in the cultivation of which\r\nthere is room for great extension, and which will provide a living for\r\nmany industrious settlers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rough-leaved Pines, Redland Bay District.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pineapple Plantation--On virgin soil, showing scrub land\r\nat back being cleared for fruit growing, Woombye District.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis magnificent fruit, which is practically unknown outside of the\r\ntropics, has become as hardy as a forest tree throughout our eastern\r\nseaboard, wherever it is planted out of frost. It has been named, and\r\nwell named too, the apple of Queensland, as it stands as much neglect,\r\nand can be grown with as little care and attention as, or even less,\r\nthan that given to the apple-trees in many of the Somerset or Devonshire\r\norchards. It will not, however, stand frost. Droughts and floods have\r\nlittle effect on it; it will grow in any soil, from a sand to a heavy\r\nloam, amongst rocks, or on a gravelly or shaley land. Naturally, it does\r\nbest in good land, but there are hundreds of cases where trees are doing\r\nwell and bearing heavily on land that is by no means fruit land. The\r\nmango is one of our handsomest fruit trees; the symmetry of its growth,\r\nits large glossy leaves, the delicate colouring of its young growth,\r\nwhich is of different shades in different varieties, the abundance of\r\nfruit that it produces, varying in colour from dull-green to yellow,\r\nred, or even purplish tints, all render it conspicuous. As well as being\r\none of our handsomest, it is also one of our most widely distributed\r\nfruits, being found growing luxuriantly the whole length of our eastern\r\nseaboard. A few trees are also to be met with inland in districts that\r\nare free from frosts, so that it stands both the dry heat of the\r\ninterior and the humid heat of the coast. As a tropical fruit it\r\nnaturally reaches its greatest perfection under our most tropical\r\nconditions, the trees there growing practically wild, requiring little\r\nif any attention, making a rapid growth, coming into bearing early, and\r\nproducing heavy crops of fruit. Further south the growth is somewhat\r\nslower, though the trees grow to a large size and bear heavily. It is\r\none of the easiest of trees to grow, as it is readily propagated by\r\nmeans of seed. In many plantations thousands of young seedlings may\r\noften be seen growing under the old trees, the seeds having taken root\r\nwithout even having been planted. In most cases it is propagated from\r\nseed, the stones of fruit showing especial merit being planted either in\r\na nursery, or, better, still, where the tree is to remain permanently,\r\nas it usually does better when so planted than when grown in a nursery\r\nand thence transplanted to its permanent location. The land should be\r\nwell worked prior to planting, and the young trees require to be kept\r\nfree from weeds and undergrowth till such time as they occupy the whole\r\nof the ground, when they are able to look after themselves, and require\r\nno further attention, at any rate in the warmer parts. It is not at all\r\nuncommon to come across a mango-tree, in full bearing, in vigorous\r\nhealth, that is growing wild, the result of a stone that has been thrown\r\naway by someone who has eaten the fruit. The young tree has not only\r\nbeen able to hold its own against all kinds of indigenous growths, but\r\nhas developed into a vigorous, healthy tree, thus showing that it is\r\nperfectly at home, and that the soil and climate of Queensland suit it\r\nto perfection. The fact that by far the greater portion of our\r\nmango-trees have been grown from seed has resulted in the production of\r\ninnumerable varieties, many of which are of decidedly inferior quality,\r\nas one never knows when planting the seed what the resultant fruit is\r\ngoing to be like. One is more likely to get good fruit by planting the\r\nseeds from selected fruit of the highest quality, but is by no means\r\ncertain to do so, as a number of seeds always revert to inferior types.\r\nThis has had a bad effect on our mango industry, and has been apt to\r\ngive the fruit as a class a bad name, so much so that we find it\r\ndifficult to get our Southern neighbours to take to it at all readily. I\r\ncan quite understand anyone, whose first experience of a mango is that\r\nof an inferior fruit, full of fibre, and having a distinctly\r\ndisagreeable flavour, condemning the particular fruit, but because there\r\nare inferior fruits one should not condemn the whole without knowing\r\nwhat a really good mango is like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mango Trees, Port Douglas.]\r\n\r\nWe have many good mangoes in Queensland, but only a few that are really\r\nfirst-class, and of the latter I have yet to meet the man or woman, who\r\nis a fruit-eater, who does not appreciate their exquisite flavour, and\r\nwho does not consider them worthy to rank with any of the finest fruits.\r\nBy many a really fine mango is considered to be the king of fruits, and\r\nI am not at all certain that they are not right, but, at the same time,\r\na really bad mango is indescribably bad.\r\n\r\nThe mango grows to a large size here, even when comparatively young. I\r\nknow trees over 50 feet in height, having a spread of the branches of\r\nmore than 60 feet, a main trunk nearly 3 feet in diameter, that are\r\nunder thirty years old, and that have borne from 1 to 2 tons of fruit\r\nfor a single crop. Hundreds of tons of fruit go to waste annually for\r\nwant of a market, or are consumed by farm animals, as the consumption of\r\nthe fruit is practically confined to this State, and the production is\r\ngreater than we can consume, despite the fact that mangoes are in season\r\nfrom the end of September to March, and that they are a favourite fruit\r\nwith all who have acquired a liking for them. In addition to the\r\nconsumption of the fruit in its fresh state, a quantity is converted\r\ninto chutney, but this is so small that it has no appreciable effect on\r\nthe crop as a whole. The unripe fruit makes an excellent substitute for\r\napples, and is used stewed or for pies or tarts, and when sliced and\r\ndried it may be stored and used in a similar manner to dried apples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mango Tree near Brisbane.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to its value as a fruit, the mango forms a handsome\r\nornamental tree, and one that provides a good shade for stock. It is\r\nvery free from disease, as with the exception of one or two species of\r\nscale insects, which do not cause any very serious damage, it has few\r\nserious pests. It is a fruit that is bound sooner or later to come into\r\nmore general favour, particularly when the qualities of the finer\r\nvarieties are better known. Until quite recently it was considered to be\r\none of the most difficult trees to propagate by means of grafting or\r\nbudding, hence its propagation has been practically confined to raising\r\nit from seed, but now we have found out how to work it by means of\r\nplate-budding, and are able to perpetuate our best sorts true to kind.\r\nThis is sure to lead to a general improvement of our existing varieties,\r\nas old trees can be worked over by this means, or young trees of\r\napproved kinds can be grown in a nursery and distributed.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is very wholesome, is much appreciated by all who have\r\nacquired a taste for it, can be used fresh or dry, ripe or unripe, and\r\ncans well. It is a great addition to our list of purely tropical fruits,\r\nand finds a place in all orchards or gardens where it is capable of\r\nbeing grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANGOSTEEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made during past years to introduce this\r\ndelicious fruit into Queensland, but these always resulted in failure.\r\nTrue, a certain variety of mangosteen has been successfully grown at\r\nPort Douglas, also on the Lower Burdekin, and rumours of the existence\r\nof the true Java mangosteen (_Garcinia mangostana_) have been received,\r\nbut, in nearly every case, they have, on investigation, proved to be\r\n_Garcinia xanthochymus_, or some other species. At the Kamerunga State\r\nNursery, however, trees of undoubted parentage were successfully raised.\r\nIt is said that a thriving young plant, which is unquestionably\r\n_G. mangostana_, is owned by Mr. Banfield, of Dunk Island. The records of\r\nthe Kamerunga Nursery show that in October, 1891, a quantity--about\r\n100--of ripe mangosteen fruit was received from the Batavian agency by\r\nthe then manager, Mr. Ebenezer Cowley, from which some 600 seeds were\r\nobtained. Of these, only a few germinated. The next mention is of the\r\ndistribution, in February, 1892, of six plants to an applicant on the\r\nMossman, and of two more in May of that year. Since then several young\r\ntrees have been raised at the nursery, and one of them, in January,\r\n1913, fruited for the first time for twenty-two years, and is the first\r\nto have done so in this State. Some of the fruit was sent to the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture and Stock, and proved to be fully equal to\r\nthose of Java. A full history of the mangosteen and of its introduction\r\ninto Queensland is given in \"The Queensland Agricultural Journal\"\r\n(vol. xxx., June and July, 1913). The photographs were taken from the\r\noriginal fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fruit of Mangosteen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PAPAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing our list of tropical fruits, we now come to the papaw, one of\r\nour most wholesome and useful fruits. It is grown all along our eastern\r\nseaboard in situations that are free from frost. It comes into bearing\r\nearly, and is a heavy cropper. Like the other tropical fruits already\r\ndescribed, it does best in our warmer parts, coming to maturity earlier,\r\nand producing better fruit. In many of the Northern coastal scrubs it is\r\noften met with growing wild, and producing fruit in abundance, the seeds\r\nfrom which the trees have been produced having been dropped by birds or\r\ndistributed by other natural agencies. The papaw fruit resembles a rock\r\nmelon somewhat in shape and flavour, the fruit being produced in the\r\naxil of the leaves all along the main stem, where they are clustered\r\nthickly together. The tree does best on well-drained soils, and is very\r\nsensitive to the presence of clay or stagnant water at the roots, hence\r\nit usually does best on scrub land or land well supplied with humus. It\r\nis propagated entirely from seed, which grows readily in such soils, and\r\nunder favourable conditions will bear its first fruit when about ten to\r\ntwelve months old, and continue to bear for three or four years or even\r\nlonger. When the trees becomes old, however, the fruit decreases in size\r\nand deteriorates in quality, so that it is necessary to plant a number\r\nyearly in order to keep up a regular supply. It is a very handsome tree,\r\nwith large spreading leaves on long stems, beneath which is its cluster\r\nof fruit--as many as 100 fruits being sometimes found in different\r\nstages of development on the one plant. The fruit ranges in size from 2\r\nlb. to some 6 lb. in weight, and when ripe it is of a greenish-yellow or\r\nsometimes orange colour. The flesh is yellow, and when quite ripe it is\r\nmoderately juicy, and of a flavour that it not always appreciated at\r\nfirst, but which one soon becomes very partial to. It more nearly\r\nresembles the flavour of a rock melon than that of any other fruit, and\r\nthe seeds, which are found clustered in the centre of the fruit, have a\r\nflavour that closely resembles that of seeds of the nasturtium. Both the\r\nseeds and the fruit contain an active principle called papain, which is\r\nreally a vegetable pepsin, that has the effect of greatly assisting in\r\nthe assimilation of all food with which it is eaten, hence it is a\r\nvaluable remedy in the case of dyspepsia, and persons who take the fruit\r\nregularly are never subject to this exceedingly troublesome disease. The\r\nfruit can be used both as a vegetable and as a fruit, the former in its\r\ngreen state, when it is boiled and served with melted butter, resembles\r\na vegetable marrow or squash, but is superior to either of these\r\nvegetables. As a fruit it is either used by itself, or in conjunction\r\nwith other fruits it forms the basis of a fruit salad. It is largely\r\nused in the North, and its cultivation is steadily spreading South, as\r\nits valuable properties are becoming better known. Its cultivation is\r\nvery simple. The seeds are either planted where the tree is to remain,\r\nor are raised in a bed and transplanted to their permanent position in\r\nthe orchard when strong enough to stand shifting, care being taken to\r\nselect a dull moist day. The young plants are protected from the sun for\r\na few days till they have become established, after which all that is\r\nnecessary is to keep down weeds and to work the soil round them,\r\ntaking care not to injure the roots. A good mulch of decomposed\r\nvegetable matter round the plants is an advantage, but they are usually\r\nso easily grown that little extra care is given to them. The papaw bears\r\nmale and female flowers, which may be on the same trees, but are usually\r\non different trees, so that it is usual to speak of male and female\r\ntrees. This is, however, a mistake, as according to Bailey the plant is\r\npolygamous--that is to say, male, female, or hermaphrodite flowers may\r\nbe found on the same or on distinct plants. The male flowers are usually\r\non long scantily-branched auxiliary panicles, whereas the female flowers\r\nare mostly in the axils of the leaves close to the stem. The two trees\r\nare not distinguishable from each other till they come into flower,\r\nhence it is advisable to set the young plants fairly close\r\ntogether--say, 6 feet apart--and thin out the male trees when same can\r\nbe distinguished by their blossoms.\r\n\r\nBesides its use as a fruit and vegetable, the papaw makes a fair\r\nconserve and an excellent sauce, and its medicinal principle, \"papain,\"\r\nis an article of commerce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Papaw in fruit, near Brisbane.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COCOA-NUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this palm can be grown for ornamental purposes as far south as\r\nBrisbane, its cultivation on commercial lines will be confined to the\r\ncoast district north of Townsville, and to the islands off the coast,\r\nas, in order to develop its fruit to perfection, it requires a tropical\r\nclimate. Where the climate is suitable it does well, it makes a rapid\r\ngrowth, and bears heavy crops of nuts. Old palms on the beach at Cairns\r\ncompare favourably with any growing in the South Seas, and I am of\r\nopinion that its culture in commercial quantities on suitable land will\r\nbe found profitable. The cocoa-nut palm does best right on or adjacent\r\nto the seashore, in comparatively poor sandy soil--soil that is usually\r\nof little value for general crops, though it will grow mangoes well. So\r\nfar, it is not grown in any large numbers, and although there is a ready\r\nsale for the ripe nuts, there is no attempt to make copra or to utilise\r\nthe coir. Copra is the dried flesh of the nut, from which oil is\r\nextracted, and is largely used in the manufacture of soap, candles, &c.,\r\nthe refuse left after the oil has been extracted being used for cattle\r\nfeed. Coir is the fibre surrounding the nut, and is used for the\r\nmanufacture of matting, door mats, &c.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable area of land suitable to the culture of this\r\nfruit on our Northern coast, which is at present lying idle, that, in my\r\nopinion, can be turned to a profitable use by planting it in cocoa-nuts\r\nas, in addition to utilising land otherwise of little value, we would be\r\nbuilding up a new industry. The trees come into bearing in about eight\r\nyears after planting the seed, and will continue to produce crops for\r\nmany years without any attention. Care will have to be given for the\r\nfirst few years, whilst the plants are small, to keep down undergrowth\r\nand to prevent fires from running through the plantation, but, once\r\nfairly established, the plants will look after themselves. A cocoa-nut\r\nplantation gives a distinctly tropical look to the district in which it\r\nis grown, and the palms, particularly when young, are very ornamental;\r\nwhen old the long bare stems detract somewhat from the beauty of the\r\ntop. It is a palm that I believe has a good future before it in the\r\nNorth, and for that reason I have included it amongst our tropical\r\nfruits, though it is cultivated at present more as an ornamental plant\r\nthan as an article of commerce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cocoa-nut Palms, Port Douglas.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRANADILLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA vine, belonging to the natural order Passifloreae, that produces one of\r\nour most delicious tropical fruits. The papaw and the passion fruit\r\nbelong to this same order. It can be grown all along our eastern\r\nseaboard, but comes to greatest perfection in the North. The fruit is of\r\na pale greenish-yellow colour, cylindrical in shape, and varies in\r\nweight from about 1 to 5 lb., the largest fruits being produced on a\r\nsub-species. The fruit consists of an outer pulpy covering, which can be\r\nused for cooking if desired, which surrounds a cavity filled with seeds\r\nwhich are encased in a jelly-like mass. This is the portion eaten, and\r\nto use an Americanism, \"It is not at all hard to take.\" It is either\r\neaten by itself, or is used in conjunction with papaw and other fruits\r\nto make a fruit salad, a dish that is fit for the food of the gods, and\r\nonce taken is never forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe granadilla is easily grown from seed, and the plants are trained on\r\nan overhead trellis, the fruit hanging down on the underside. It is a\r\nheavy bearer, and once planted requires little attention. It requires a\r\nfree, warm soil, that is fairly rich, to be grown to perfection, hence\r\nit is most commonly grown on scrub land. It can, however, be grown on\r\nany well-prepared land of a free nature. Unfortunately, it is a\r\ndifficult fruit to ship any distance, hence its consumption is mainly\r\nconfined to the districts in which it is grown, and where, needless to\r\nsay, it is greatly appreciated. It is in fruit more or less all the year\r\nround, its main crop being in early spring in the North, and during the\r\nsummer months further South. It is sometimes made into jam or jelly, but\r\nwhen preserved loses much of its characteristic flavour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Granadilla Vine at Kuranda, Cairns district.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PASSION FRUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fruit is very closely related to the granadilla, but is much\r\nhardier than it, and can be grown to perfection much further South. It\r\nis not injured by frost to any extent in any part of coastal Queensland,\r\nand can be grown a considerable distance inland. It is more rightly a\r\nsemi-tropical than a tropical fruit, though, as it is so nearly related\r\nto the granadilla, I have included it amongst the tropical fruits. It is\r\nalso a vine, and, when grown commercially, is trained along a horizontal\r\ntrellis, in a somewhat similar manner to a grape vine. It is readily\r\ngrown from seed, and will produce fruit in less than twelve months from\r\nthe time that it is planted, and will continue to bear fruit for some\r\nyears. It does best on a free, warm soil of fair quality, though it may\r\nbe grown anywhere with care, and often thrives well in very poor soils\r\nwith the addition of manure. It is found growing wild on the borders of\r\nmany of our scrubs and elsewhere, the seeds having been deposited by\r\nbirds or other agencies, and under such conditions it produces an\r\nabundance of fruit. The fruit is of a roundish oval shape, and is of a\r\ndark-purple colour. It is about the size of a large hen's egg, the outer\r\nskin being hard and shell-like, and the centre filled with the seeds,\r\nwhich are surrounded with a jelly-like mass and a yellowish pulp. It is\r\na very fine flavoured fruit, and is universally liked. It is grown in\r\nconsiderable quantities in the Southern part of the State, and is one of\r\nour commonest fruits. It has usually two crops a year--a summer and a\r\nwinter crop--but can be got to produce its fruit at any particular time\r\nthat is desired by systematic pruning at different times of the year. It\r\nis often grown over sheds, dead trees, fallen logs, &c., which it covers\r\nwith a mass of dense green foliage, and converts what would otherwise be\r\nan unsightly object into an ornament. The illustration herewith shows\r\nthis well, and gives a good idea of the growth of a single vine.\r\nCommercially it is grown on trellis, so that the land between the rows\r\ncan be kept well cultivated, and also to permit of ease in the gathering\r\nof the fruit. When ripe, the fruit drops, and the gathering is usually\r\nfrom the ground. The fruit carries well, but will not keep for any\r\nlength of time, as it shrivels up. It is principally used as a fresh\r\nfruit, though it is also made into jam or jelly, and it often forms part\r\nof a fruit salad, taking the place of the granadilla. It has few pests,\r\nand is one of the easiest fruits to grow.\r\n\r\n[Illustrations: Passion Fruit, Redland Bay--Showing method of culture (1)\r\nand part of a vine in fruit (2).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSTARD APPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this heading I will include all the Anonas, such as the sour sop,\r\nsweet sop, bullock's heart, and cherimoya. The sour sop is purely\r\ntropical, and is very sensitive to frost, but the other species are by\r\nno means so tender, and can be grown anywhere along the coast where the\r\nsoil is suitable, as well as at many inland places. All the species\r\nproduce very fine fruits, that vary somewhat in shape, in the roughness\r\nof the skin, and in size. The sour sop is the largest, and attains a\r\nsize of 6 to 8 lb. The fruit is covered with soft spines, and is of an\r\nirregular oval, or even pyriform, shape. It ripens very soon after it is\r\ngathered, consequently cannot be sent any distance. It is a pleasant\r\nfruit of an aromatic sub-acid flavour. The pulp surrounding the seeds is\r\nof a woolly consistency, and this is surrounded by a custard-like mass\r\nwhich is much appreciated by those who have acquired a liking for it. It\r\nis a comparatively uncommon fruit, and is confined to the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe sweet sop is the commonest of the Anonas, and is grown throughout a\r\nconsiderable part of coastal Queensland. It is usually of an irregular\r\nroundish shape, very full of seeds, which are surrounded by a\r\ncustard-like pulp of very pleasant flavour. It is usually a heavy\r\nbearer, and is the variety most commonly met with in our fruit stores.\r\nThe tree is hardy and is easily grown.\r\n\r\nThe bullock's heart is a stronger-growing variety than the previous one,\r\nthe fruit is larger, and, as its name implies, heart-shaped. It is also\r\nfairly seedy, the pulp of a light-brown colour, and more gritty, and\r\nnot, in my opinion, of first-rate quality. It is most commonly grown in\r\nthe North, where it is a very hardy and prolific tree.\r\n\r\nThe cherimoya is the best of the custard apples. The tree is a strong\r\ngrower, with large handsome leaves, but, as a rule, it is not a very\r\nheavy bearer. There are many varieties, the fruit of which varies\r\nconsiderably in size and shape, and the skin is sometimes smooth and\r\nsometimes warted, or even covered with short soft spines. It has\r\nusually comparatively few seeds, and these are surrounded by a rich\r\ncustard-like pulp, which in the better kinds is of very fine flavour,\r\nand is generally much liked. The fruit is not a good keeper, still,\r\ngiven careful handling and packing, it can be kept for nearly a week.\r\nAll custard apples are easily raised from seed, but the better varieties\r\nare propagated by grafting strong seedlings with wood taken from a tree\r\nproducing fruit of especial merit. Any good fruit soil will grow them,\r\nand they do not require any especial treatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Custard Apples, Brisbane District.]\r\n\r\nThere are still a large number of tropical fruits that I have not\r\nmentioned, but space will not permit of my giving them more than a\r\npassing notice, as they are not of any great value from a commercial\r\nstandpoint at present. Of these fruits the litchi, whampee, averoha,\r\nlongan, vi-apple, and Chinese mangosteen are practically confined to the\r\nNorth. The guava, of which there are many species, grows anywhere; in\r\nfact, it is a pest in many cases, taking complete possession of the\r\nland. It is not cultivated to any great extent, as it grows so readily\r\nwithout, and, further, it harbours several pests whose presence it is\r\ndesirable to remove from the orchard. It is a useful fruit for home\r\nconsumption, as it stews well, makes an excellent jam, and its jelly is\r\none of the best.\r\n\r\nThe rosella, a species of hibiscus, is an annual fruit that is grown to\r\na considerable extent in several parts of the State, and is used for\r\npies, jams, and jellies. The latter is remarkably good, equal to that\r\nmade from the red currant of colder climes, and will no doubt become an\r\narticle of export at no very distant date. The fruit also dries well,\r\nand makes an excellent pickle. It is raised from seed, the young\r\nseedlings being set out in well-prepared land when all danger of frost\r\nis past. It is a rapid grower, and forms a bush some 4 feet across by 4\r\nor 5 feet high. It is a heavy bearer, and the fruit meets with a ready\r\nsale. To do well, the plants require a warm, free, well-drained soil, as\r\nthey do not thrive where there is any stagnant water at or near the\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nThe avocado or alligator pear is not grown to any extent, though it\r\nthrives well, particularly to the north of the tropic of Capricorn, and\r\ncan also be grown successfully as far south as the New South Wales\r\nborder. It is a fruit that deserves to be cultivated to a much greater\r\nextent than it is at present, and once it becomes better known I have no\r\ndoubt that it will be planted in considerable numbers, and prove a very\r\nwelcome addition to our already long list of fruits, as it is\r\nunequalled, in my opinion, as a salad. As far as my experience goes, it\r\nis likely to become a profitable fruit to grow, as once persons acquire\r\na liking for it, they become very partial to it, and eat it whenever\r\nthey can get it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to purely tropical fruits a number of semi-tropical fruits\r\nare grown on our eastern seaboard, but are not entirely confined\r\nthereto, as many of them are cultivated to a considerable extent in some\r\nparts of our coastal and inland tablelands, particularly in sheltered\r\npositions. Under the heading of semi-tropical fruits, all kinds of\r\ncitrus fruits, persimmons, loquats, date palm, wine palm, pecan nut,\r\nBrazilian cherry, Natal plum, ki-apple, and many other fruits are\r\nincluded, as well as several fruits that more properly belong to the\r\ntemperate regions, such as Japanese plums, Chickasaw plum, peaches of\r\nChinese origin, figs, mulberries of sorts, strawberries, cape\r\ngooseberries, &c. Of all of these the citrus fruits, which include the\r\norange, mandarin, Seville, lemon, lime, grape fruit, kumquat, citron,\r\nand pomelo are by far the most important, and are grown successfully\r\nover a very large portion of the State, so that we will consider them\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sour Sop, Mossman District.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCITRUS FRUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuite a number of fruits are included under this heading, and all reach\r\na very high state of perfection in this State. The whole of the family,\r\nthe lemon-shaped citron excepted, is noted for the beauty and symmetry\r\nof growth that its trees make, and I know of few more beautiful sights\r\nin the vegetable world than a well-kept citrus grove in full bearing.\r\nTake the common round orange as an example, its well-balanced and evenly\r\ngrown head, its dark glossy green foliage, its wealth of white blossoms,\r\nwhich perfume the whole neighbourhood, or its mass of golden fruit\r\nbetween its dark-green leaves, render it one of the most beautiful of\r\nfruit trees at all times, but especially so when covered with blossoms\r\nor ripe fruit. A typical Queensland grove is even more beautiful than\r\nthose of many other places, as the vigour and size of our trees, their\r\nexceptionally healthy appearance, their dark foliage, and the heavy crop\r\nof high-class fruit that they bear, are at once evident to a stranger\r\nwho has never seen the orange grown under such favourable conditions as\r\nare experienced here. The yield is often so heavy that the trees\r\nactually bend to the ground with the weight of their fruit, and a\r\nstack of props has to be used to prevent the tree from splitting into\r\npieces. Those who have seen the enormous crops of apples that are\r\nproduced on some trees in Tasmania or the old cider orchards of Devon or\r\nSomerset can form an idea of the crops; but the writer, who has seen\r\nboth, as well as our Queensland trees, has no hesitation in saying that\r\na Queensland mandarin can give points to either as a heavy cropper; in\r\nfact, if it has a fault, it is its proneness to overbear, particularly\r\nwhen young. This all tends to prove how well adapted Queensland is to\r\nthe growth of citrus fruits, and were I asked to select a country\r\nparticularly suited to their culture I should have no hesitation in\r\nnaming this State, as I know of nowhere where their culture can be\r\ncarried out with less trouble, or where the trees will produce better\r\nfruit or heavier crops. Queensland may well be termed the home of citrus\r\nfruits, as we have no less than three native species which are\r\nindigenous to the State, and are by no means uncommon in our scrubs.\r\nTheir presence gives unmistakable proof of the suitability of this State\r\nfor the culture of fruits of the same family, so that I think a short\r\ndescription of these native species may not be out of place, but will be\r\nof some interest to my readers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Young Orange Orchard (6 years old) on scrub land, near\r\nMapleton, Blackall Range. Showing the standing scrub in the background.]\r\n\r\n_Citrus australis_, the native orange or lime, is both the largest and\r\nmost common. It grows into a large tree, having a diameter of 15 to 18\r\ninches in the trunk, and a height of 60 feet or more. It produces a\r\nquantity of thick-skinned acid fruit, of from 2 to 3 inches in diameter.\r\nThe skin is full of a resinous sap, and the fruit is of little value. It\r\nis a slow-growing tree, though, as just mentioned, it attains a\r\nconsiderable size, is very hardy, and produces a quantity of fruit. Its\r\nslow growth, when young, has prevented its use as a stock on which to\r\nwork improved varieties, but I have no doubt it would make a very hardy\r\nstock that would be distinctly disease-resistant.\r\n\r\nThe second variety is _Citrus australasica_, the so-called finger lime,\r\na thorny bush, producing a fruit of from 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter, and\r\n3 to 4 inches long. The fruit has a thin skin, and contains an agreeable\r\nacid pulp that varies in colour, in some specimens being of a reddish\r\ntinge that resembles the pulp of a blood orange. These two varieties are\r\nmet with in the Southern part of the State, but the third is a Northern\r\nspecies, to which Mr. F. M. Bailey, our Colonial Botanist, has given the\r\nname of _Citrus inodora_, the North Queensland lime. It is met with in\r\nthe scrubs of the Russell River, and is described by Mr. Bailey as\r\nbearing a greater resemblance to the cultivated species than the two\r\nformer varieties. It produces a fruit over 2 inches long by 1-1/4 inches\r\nin diameter, having a thin rind and a juicy pulp of a sharply acid\r\nflavour, so that even in its wild state it is a desirable fruit, and\r\ntakes the place of the cultivated lemon. Where native species flourish\r\nas they do here, there is every probability of cultivated species\r\nthriving equally well, and this is found to be the case in practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A young Orange Orchard, Woombye District.]\r\n\r\nNo fruits are more generally distributed or have a wider range in this\r\nState than those of the Citrus family, as, with the exception of the\r\ncolder parts of the Downs, where the winter temperature is too low, the\r\nGulf country, and the dry Western districts, where there is no water\r\navailable for irrigation, they can be grown from one end of the State to\r\nthe other, provided that they are planted in suitable soil, and that, in\r\nthe drier parts, there is an available supply of suitable water with\r\nwhich to irrigate them during the prevalence of long dry spells. The\r\ncountry adjoining the eastern seaboard, extending from the Tweed River\r\nin the South to Cooktown in the North--a distance of about 1,100 miles,\r\nand extending inland for nearly 100 miles--is naturally suited to the\r\ngrowth of citrus fruits, and there is probably no country in the world\r\nthat is better adapted to, or that can produce the various kinds of\r\nthese fruits to greater perfection or with less trouble, than this\r\nportion of Queensland. Of course, the whole of this large area is not\r\nadapted for citrus culture, as it contains many different kinds of\r\nsoils, several of which are not suitable for the growth of these fruits,\r\nand there is also a large extent of country which is too broken and\r\notherwise unsuitable. At the same time there are hundreds of thousands\r\nof acres of land in this area in which the soil and natural conditions\r\nare eminently suited to the growth of citrus fruit, and in which the\r\ntenderest varieties of these fruits may be grown to perfection without\r\nthe slightest chance of their being injured by frost; and where the\r\nnatural rainfall is such that, provided the trees receive ordinary care\r\nand cultivation, there is seldom any necessity for artificial\r\nirrigation. At the present time there are hundreds of citrus trees\r\ngrowing practically wild in different parts of the coastal country that\r\nare in vigorous health and producing heavy crops of good fruit, even\r\nthough they are uncultivated, unpruned, unmanured, and have to hold\r\ntheir own against a vigorous growth of native and introduced shrubs,\r\ntrees, and weeds. When the orange, lime, citron, or common lemon become\r\nestablished under conditions that are favourable for their proper\r\ndevelopment, they apparently become as hardy as the indigenous plants,\r\nand are able to hold their own against them, thus showing how well the\r\nclimate and suitable soils of coastal Queensland are adapted for the\r\ncultivation of citrus fruits. The commercial cultivation of citrus\r\nfruits is at present practically confined to this coastal area, the most\r\nimportant centres, starting from the South, being Nerang, Coomera,\r\nRedland Bay, Brisbane, Enoggera, Gatton, Grantham, Toowoomba, North\r\nCoast line from North Pine to Gympie including the Blackall Range and\r\nBuderim Mountain; the Wide Bay district, including Maryborough, Tiaro,\r\nMount Bauple, Gayndah, Pialba, and Burrum; the Burnett district,\r\nincluding Bundaberg and Mullet Creek; the Fitzroy district, including\r\nRockhampton and Yeppoon; Bowen, Cardwell, Murray River, Tully River,\r\nCairns and district, Port Douglas, and Cooktown. In addition to these\r\ndistricts a few citrus fruits are grown at Mackay, Townsville, and\r\nseveral other places. Citrus fruits are also grown further inland, but\r\ntheir cultivation here is largely dependent on the ability to supply the\r\ntrees with suitable water for irrigation during dry spells. Frosts have\r\nalso to be taken into consideration, for, though the days are warm, the\r\ntemperature often falls considerably during the night, owing to the\r\ngreat radiation, and citrus-trees in districts like Roma, Emerald, &c.,\r\nare liable to injury thereby. West of Emerald, at Bogantungan,\r\nBarcaldine, and other places, citrus fruits do very well with\r\nirrigation. Some of the finest lemons, Washington Navel, and other\r\nimproved varieties of oranges are grown here to perfection, the lemons\r\nespecially being of high quality, and curing down equal to the imported\r\nItalian or Californian article. The soil in many of the inland districts\r\nis well suited to the culture of citrus fruits, and when the trees are\r\ngiven the necessary water, and are uninjured by frost, they produce\r\nexcellent fruit. I stated, some short distance back, that there is\r\nprobably no country in the world that is better adapted to the\r\ncultivation of or that can produce the various kinds of citrus fruits to\r\ngreater perfection or with less trouble than the eastern seaboard of\r\nQueensland. To many of my readers this may seem to be a very broad\r\nstatement; but I am certain that, if suitable trees are planted in the\r\nright soil and under favourable conditions, and are given anything like\r\nthe same care and attention that is devoted to the culture of citrus\r\nfruits in the great producing centres for these fruits in other parts of\r\nthe world, we have nothing to fear either as regards the cost of\r\nproduction or the quality of the fruit produced. In order to exemplify\r\nthis, it may be interesting to compare our capabilities with those of\r\nthe principal citrus-producing districts north of the equator. To begin\r\nwith, I will take Florida, which more nearly approaches our climatic\r\nconditions than any other citrus-growing country that I know of, and\r\nwhich is noted for the excellence of its citrus fruit, and we find that\r\nwe have all its advantages except that of proximity to the world's\r\nmarkets, without its disadvantages. We have a better and richer soil,\r\nrequiring far less expensive artificial fertilisers to maintain its\r\nfertility, and at a very much lower price. We can grow equally as good\r\nfruit; in fact, it is questionable if Florida ever produced a citrus\r\nfruit equal in quality to the Beauty of Glen Retreat Mandarin, a\r\nQueensland production. We get as heavy, if not heavier, crops, and our\r\ntrees come into bearing very early. We have no freeze-outs similar to\r\nthose which have crippled the industry in Florida so severely in the\r\npast that many of their wealthy growers are actually covering in whole\r\norchards of many acres in extent as a protection from frost. This\r\ncovering-in is accomplished by means of a framework of timber having\r\nslat-work or panel sides and tops--in fact, by enclosing their orchards\r\nin a huge elaborate bush-house, which is further protected by the heat\r\nproduced by six large heating stoves or salamanders to each acre of\r\ntrees enclosed. If it pays the Florida growers to go to all this expense\r\nin order to prevent freeze-outs and to produce first-class fruit, surely\r\nwe can compete with them when a seed stuck in the right soil under\r\nfavourable conditions will produce a strong, vigorous, healthy tree,\r\nbearing good crops without any attention whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Orange Orchard, near Woombye.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Orange Trophy in the Moreton District Exhibit at the\r\nBrisbane Exhibition.]\r\n\r\nIn comparing Queensland with the citrus-producing districts of Southern\r\nEurope, we have the advantage of better and cheaper land, absence of\r\nfrost, more vigorous growth, earlier maturity of the trees, and superior\r\nfruit; but with the advantage of cheaper and more skilful labour,\r\nespecially in the handling and marketing of fruit, and proximity to the\r\nworld's markets in their favour.\r\n\r\nAs compared with California, our soil is no better than theirs, but it\r\ncosts much less, and their citrus industry is dependent on artificial\r\nirrigation, their natural rainfall being altogether inadequate for the\r\ngrowth of citrus fruits. Californian conditions more nearly approach\r\nthose of our inland districts, such as Barcaldine, with the exception\r\nthat the only rainfall in California is during the winter, whereas in\r\nBarcaldine and similar districts the heaviest fall is during the summer\r\nmonths, but, in both, the successful culture of these fruits depends on\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nIn Jaffa, also, where the oranges are of large size and extra quality,\r\nthe trees have to be carefully irrigated and manured, as these\r\noperations are found to be essential to the production of marketable\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nThese few instances show how favourably the conditions prevailing in\r\nQueensland compare with those of the great citrus-growing districts of\r\nEurope and America, especially in the matter of soil and climate, and I\r\nfeel confident that, if the industry were taken up in the same\r\nbusiness-like manner that it has been done in California and Florida, we\r\ncould easily hold our own against any part of the world. In comparing\r\nQueensland with the rest of the world we have the advantage--also shared\r\nby New South Wales and South Africa--of ripening our fruit at a time of\r\nthe year which is the off season in the citrus-producing countries to\r\nthe north of the equator, so that our fruit does not clash with theirs,\r\ntheir ripening period and ours being at different times of the year. As\r\nregards our Australian market, our fruit ripening earlier than that of\r\nthe Southern States, we are enabled to dispose of a considerable portion\r\nof our crop in the Southern markets before the local fruit is ready for\r\ngathering. This gives us three markets--first, a local one; secondly, a\r\nSouthern one; and, finally, when this demand is supplied, an oversea\r\nmarket to Europe, America, and the East.\r\n\r\nWhen grown under favourable conditions, citrus-trees are heavy bearers\r\nin this State, it being no uncommon thing to meet with seedling or\r\nworked orange-trees of from ten to twelve years of age producing over\r\ntwenty cases of marketable fruit to the tree, averaging about 10 dozen\r\nmedium-sized fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bunch of Valencia late Oranges, Blackall Range District.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washington Navel Oranges, Barcaldine District, Central\r\nLine.]\r\n\r\nCitrus-trees of all kinds, particularly worked trees, come into bearing\r\nvery early, and the returns obtained from an orchard rapidly increase.\r\nThe illustrations give a good idea of the rapid growth, and a fair one\r\nof the crop of fruit the young trees are bearing, but the following\r\nexamples, taken at random for the crop that was marketed in January,\r\n1906, will show better how our trees bear:--\r\n\r\n     Mr. A., Blackall Range, marketed 7-1/4 cases per tree from a row of\r\n     twenty-five Beauty of Glen Retreat Mandarins, planted April, 1900.\r\n     A return of L1 10s. per tree.\r\n\r\n     Mr. B., from the same district, averaged 7 cases of Washington\r\n     Navel Oranges per tree from trees six years old, which realised L1\r\n     15s. per tree, and 8 cases of Beauty of Glen Retreat Mandarins from\r\n     trees of the same age. The navels were large, and averaged 5 dozen\r\n     per case, and the mandarins 10 dozen per case.\r\n\r\n     Mr. C, another district, averaged 6 cases of Valencia Late Oranges,\r\n     from trees six years planted, and 10 cases per tree from Emperor\r\n     Mandarins, nine years old.\r\n\r\n     One twelve years old orange-tree in this district produced over 25\r\n     cases of fruit.\r\n\r\n     Mr. D., same district as last; Washington Navels averaged 10 cases\r\n     per tree, ten years planted, and have borne regular crops since\r\n     three years old.\r\n\r\nNumerous other cases might be given, but the above are sufficient to\r\nshow the earliness at which our trees bear, and the crops they yield.\r\nTrees in full bearing often yield up to 40 cases, but these are usually\r\nold seedlings, which bear a very heavy crop one year and a comparatively\r\nlight crop the next. All the instances I have quoted are from worked\r\ntrees, which are found to give the most regular and constant yields.\r\nUntil quite recently, citrus-trees were almost entirely grown from seed\r\nin this State, with the result that we have a very large number of\r\ntypes, and many crosses between different species. This was not\r\nadvisable, as a uniformity in type is desirable for marketing, hence the\r\ngreater number of trees now being planted are of selected varieties of\r\nproved merit. Many of the seedlings have produced most excellent fruit,\r\nbut a seedling has usually the disadvantage of being very full of\r\nseeds, and having a lot of rag (the indigestible fibre round the pulp)\r\nas compared with the worked varieties, which have either no seeds or\r\nvery few seeds and little rag. Seedlings are also of many types, and\r\nthey produce a lot of small fruit, thereby making an uneven sample,\r\nwhereas worked trees produce fruit even in size and quality. Seedlings\r\nare probably the hardiest, and will stand the most neglect, but\r\nexperience is showing that worked trees are the most profitable to grow.\r\nThe growth of all kinds of citrus-trees from seed is a very simple\r\nmatter, all that is necessary being a well-prepared seed bed of friable\r\nsoil that is partially shaded from the heat of the sun, so as to protect\r\nthe young plants. Selected, fully ripe fruit from well-grown, prolific,\r\nhealthy trees is taken, and the seeds sown in rows in the seed bed, or\r\nbroadcast when weeds are not likely to be any trouble. Fresh seed\r\ngerminates quickly, and the young plants are soon ready to be\r\ntransplanted into the nursery bed, where they are either worked over or\r\nallowed to remain seedlings. At twelve months old, from seed, a tree\r\nwill have a stem-diameter of about 3/4-inch, and a height of 3 to 4\r\nfeet, a growth about twice that made in the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThe general remarks I have given respecting our fruit soils apply with\r\nequal force to those best adapted for citrus culture--viz., they must\r\npossess perfect drainage, and be of a friable nature. We are growing\r\nmost of the best varieties of citrus fruit, the original trees from\r\nwhich they are now being propagated having been introduced into the\r\nState from the most celebrated citrus-producing districts in the world,\r\nand, as stated and shown by the accompanying illustrations, they are all\r\ndoing well.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Navel, the variety of orange most commonly grown in\r\nCalifornia, does remarkably well on our rich volcanic scrub soils, where\r\nit has proved itself a regular bearer of high-class fruit. The\r\nMediterranean Sweet Orange, Valencia Late, and Jaffa also do well in\r\nmany parts, the Valencia Late adapting itself to most districts. Many\r\nother kinds of oranges are grown, but the varieties mentioned are some\r\nof the best, and are the ones now being planted in the greatest\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spray of Orange Blossom.]\r\n\r\nIn mandarins, all kinds do remarkably well, and I never saw this fruit\r\nproduced to greater perfection in any part of the world than it is in\r\nQueensland. The varieties most commonly grown are: The Emperor or\r\nCanton, the Scarlet or Scarlet Emperor, Thorny or Tangerine, and Beauty\r\nof Glen Retreat, though there are many types of seedlings in addition to\r\nthese well-known sorts. The grape fruit which is now so popular in\r\nAmerica does well, but, so far, has not taken on in our markets. Citrons\r\ngrow practically wild, and produce good fruit, for which there is a\r\nlimited demand for peel. Their cultivation could be extended with ease\r\nwere there a better demand for peel. The Seville Orange, which is used\r\nfor the manufacture of marmalade, is an exceptionally hardy and prolific\r\ntree, and, were it required, we could easily grow enough of this fruit\r\nto supply the world. Lemons do best inland, or at an elevation of some\r\n2,000 feet above sea-level, as this fruit is apt to become too coarse in\r\nthe skin when grown in a humid climate. In suitable localities very good\r\nfruit can be grown, which compares very favourably with the European or\r\nAmerican grown fruit.\r\n\r\nThe lime does well in the more humid districts, taking the place of the\r\nlemon, and one variety--the Tahiti--has proved itself to be a heavy and\r\nregular bearer. The West Indian lime, from which the lime juice of\r\ncommerce is made, is very easily grown, particularly in the more\r\ntropical parts, where it is often met with growing in an entirely\r\nuncultivated condition, and bearing heavy crops of fruit. Kumquats are\r\neasily grown, and are heavy bearers, and all the different types of\r\npomelos or shaddocks do well. Seedlings of the latter are very hardy, as\r\nthey are deep-rooted plants that stand dry weather well and are,\r\nconsequently, not liable to injury during dry spells. There is very\r\nlittle demand for the fruit, but I am of opinion that the seedlings will\r\nprove to be of value as stocks on which to work our best kinds of\r\noranges.\r\n\r\nThe culture of all kinds of citrus fruits, when grown in suitable soil,\r\nis by no means difficult, as it consists mainly of keeping the land well\r\nstirred and keeping down all weed growth during dry spells, the keeping\r\nof the trees well pruned out in the centre, and the keeping in check of\r\nall diseases, both insect and fungus. Although citrus fruits are subject\r\nto many pests, they are for the most part easily kept in check by either\r\nspraying or cyaniding, or both, provided that reasonable care is taken,\r\nand the pests are destroyed before they have obtained control. Taken as\r\na whole, our citrus fruits are remarkably clean, and compare more than\r\nfavourably with those grown in the Southern States. The culture of these\r\nfruits is extending rapidly, with a corresponding increase in\r\nproduction, but, despite this, our prices have been better during the\r\npast season than for some years, as the quality of our fruit is such\r\nthat it will command a good market. When properly handled, it has good\r\nkeeping qualities, and I have no doubt that we will, in time, be able to\r\nsupply the markets of the Old and New Worlds with good fruit, in the\r\nbest of condition, at the time of the year that their markets are bare\r\nof locally-grown citrus fruit.\r\n\r\nThere is a good opening for the growth of citrus fruits in this State,\r\nas the writer knows of no country where they do better, where they can\r\nbe produced with as little trouble and expense, where they can be\r\nsuccessfully grown over such a large area, or where the soil and climate\r\nis more suited to the production of fruits of the highest quality as in\r\nQueensland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lisbon Lemon, Esk District.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERSIMMON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis exceedingly handsome fruit of Japanese origin is grown to a high\r\nstate of perfection in this State, particularly in the coastal districts\r\nsouth of the tropic of Capricorn. It is a fruit of comparatively recent\r\nintroduction, the oldest trees being less than thirty years of age, but\r\nhas already become widely distributed, as well as a favourite fruit\r\namongst many. It is a very showy fruit when well grown, but must be\r\nthoroughly ripe before it is eaten, as, if not, it is extremely\r\nastringent, and anyone who has tackled an unripe fruit has no wish to\r\nrepeat the experience in a hurry. There are many varieties of this\r\nfruit, some of which are seedless, and others more or less seedy. The\r\nseedless kinds are usually preferred, as, as well as being seedless,\r\nthey are the largest and handsomest fruit. The different kinds vary\r\nconsiderably in the size of tree, habit of growth, foliage, size and\r\ncolour of fruit, &c. All are easily grown, and most kinds are good and\r\nregular bearers. They do well on any fruit soil, and some of the\r\ndwarf-growing kinds are well adapted for growing in private gardens, on\r\naccount of the small amount of room they take up. The trees are\r\ndeciduous, and, as a rule, are not much troubled with pests. So far, the\r\nuse of the fruit is confined to its consumption fresh, though in Japan\r\nit is dried in a similar manner to apricots or peaches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Persimmons.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOQUAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA handsome evergreen tree, that can be grown in the more Southerly coast\r\ndistricts, in the foothills of the coast range, and on the coast\r\ntablelands. There are several types of the fruit, whose chief value\r\nconsists in that it ripens its fruit in early spring, when there is a\r\nshortage of stone fruits, and that it withstands wind well, so makes a\r\ngood break for the protection of exposed orchards. Its cultivation is\r\nnot extensive, nor is it likely to become so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fruit of Loquat (1/2 natural size).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DATE PALM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this extremely valuable fruit is grown in this State more as an\r\nornament than for its commercial value, there is nothing to prevent its\r\nculture on a scale sufficiently large to supply the Australian\r\nrequirements. It is grown in many places along the coast, as well as in\r\nthe foothills country of the coastal range, but it does best in\r\nsituations that more nearly resemble its natural habitat--viz., in\r\ndistricts having a hot dry air, a deep sandy loam or sandy soil, and a\r\ngood supply of moisture in the soil. This latter condition does not\r\noccur naturally, but can be supplied artificially in our Western lands,\r\nwhere there is a good supply of artesian water of a quality suitable to\r\nthe plants' requirements. Here the date palm thrives, and produces huge\r\nbunches of fruit. Little, if any, cultivation is necessary when once the\r\npalm is firmly established; provided it has an ample but not excessive\r\nsupply of moisture, it is able to take care of itself.\r\n\r\nThe date palm is a dioecious plant--that is to say, the male organs,\r\nor stamens, are produced on one plant, and the female organs, or\r\npistils, on another, and this necessitates the growing of the two sexes\r\nin proximity to each other, in order that the female flowers may be\r\nfertilised and produce perfect fruit. This is best accomplished\r\nartificially, the pollen from a fully developed bunch of male flowers\r\nbeing shaken over the bunch of female flowers. Infertile fruit contains\r\nno seeds, and is of small size and inferior quality, whereas the fertile\r\nfruit is both large and good.\r\n\r\nThe date palm is a handsome ornamental plant, and in the hot and dry\r\nWestern districts, where it thrives best, it forms a splendid shelter\r\nfrom the sun for both man and beast. So far, very little attention has\r\nbeen given to its growth, few persons knowing how to fertilise the\r\nflowers or even taking the trouble to see that they have plants of both\r\nsexes. There is no reason why this should be so, as there would be a\r\ngood local demand for the properly-cured fruit, and I believe that, were\r\nits culture carried out in a thorough business manner, it would become a\r\nprofitable industry, and one capable of supplying our Australian market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Date Palms in fruit at Barcaldine.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PECAN NUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother little-known fruit which does well in this State. It belongs to\r\nthe hickory family, and closely resembles the walnut. There are trees\r\nnow growing in the Maryborough district that are some 15 inches in\r\ndiameter at the trunk, and from 40 to 50 feet in height, that bear\r\nregular and heavy crops of nuts, and that have stood drought and been\r\nunder flood. For years the trees have received no cultivation, and they\r\nhave shown themselves to be as hardy as the adjacent indigenous trees.\r\nThe trees are easily raised from seed, and come into bearing in about\r\neight years. Like all nut fruits, it is advisable to set the nut where\r\nthe tree is to remain permanently, if it is possible to do so, as it\r\nproduces a very deep taproot, with few laterals, and is consequently\r\ndifficult to shift. The soil on which it does best is an alluvial loam,\r\nand, if possible, it should not be more than 30 feet to water, as the\r\ntree, being a very deep rooter, will penetrate a free soil to that\r\ndepth. It will do on other free loamy soils, but will not make the same\r\ngrowth as when planted in free alluvials. It has been tested in several\r\nparts of the State, and it is probable that it will be found to thrive\r\nover a considerable area of the coastal and coastal tablelands\r\ndistricts. It produces an olive or acorn shaped nut, having a thin\r\nshell, and of a flavour closely resembling that of a good walnut, and\r\nwill be a valuable addition to our list of nut fruits once it becomes\r\nbetter known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Date Fruit (natural size).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE PLUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll varieties of this fruit thrive well and bear heavily in the more\r\nSoutherly part of our coast country, as well as on the country\r\nimmediately adjacent to it, the coastal tablelands, and several other\r\nparts of the State. The trees are rapid growers, come into bearing very\r\nearly, and often bear enormous crops of fruit. They are good fruits for\r\nhome consumption or for the fresh-fruit trade, but are not equal to\r\nEuropean varieties of plums for preserving, drying, or jam-making. In\r\nthis State they have one very great drawback, and that is their\r\nliability to the attack of the fruit fly, a pest that very frequently\r\ndestroys the entire crop. For home use they are, however, a very useful\r\nfruit to grow, provided that the trees are kept dwarf, so that they can\r\nbe covered with a cheap mosquito netting as a protection from the fly,\r\nas they are very easily grown, are by no means particular as to the kind\r\nof soil on which planted, and are heavy bearers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICKASAW PLUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis family of American plums does well in the same districts as the\r\nJapanese varieties just dealt with, but has the advantage of being\r\nresistant to the fruit fly. The trees are usually more or less\r\nstraggling growers, the fruit is of small size, but good for cooking or\r\njam-making. One or more of the varieties of this plum are bad setters,\r\nthough they blossom profusely, but this may be overcome either by\r\nworking two varieties which bloom at the same time on to the same stock,\r\nor by planting varieties that bloom at the same time together, as the\r\npollen from the one will set the fruit of the other. It is a good plum\r\nfor home use or marketing, despite its small size, as it is easily\r\ngrown, requires little attention, and is not over particular as to soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINESE PEACHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeaches of Chinese origin thrive well on the coast, and are extremely\r\nhardy. The fruit is not, as a rule, of high quality when compared with\r\nthat of the Persian varieties, but their earliness and ease with which\r\nthey can be grown causes them to be planted by many who have small\r\ngardens. Like the Japanese plums they are, however, very subject to the\r\nattack of fruit fly, and require to be kept dwarf and covered in a\r\nsimilar manner if any good is to be got from them. On the coast, they\r\nare practically evergreen, as they never lose their leaves entirely,\r\nand are in blossom during the winter. When grown on the tablelands, this\r\nearly blossoming is a disadvantage, as the blossoms are liable to be\r\ninjured by frost, but in these districts peaches of Persian origin can\r\nbe grown instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral kinds of figs can be grown successfully in the Southern coast\r\ndistricts, the first crop ripening before Christmas, but the second or\r\nmain crop is often a failure, owing to the fact that it ripens during\r\nour wet season, and the fruit consequently sours and bursts. As one\r\nrecedes from the coast, the fruit does better, and is less liable to\r\ninjury from excessive wet. The coastal tablelands and the more Western\r\nDowns grow it well, and the trees, when planted on soil of a rich\r\nfriable nature, grow to a large size and bear heavily. Many varieties\r\nare grown, which are used fresh or converted into jam, but no attempt\r\nhas been made to dry them, though it is possible that this industry may\r\neventually be found profitable in the drier parts of the State, where\r\nthere is water available for the trees' use at certain periods of the\r\nyear, but not during the fruiting period, as it cannot well be too dry\r\nthen if a good quality of dried figs is to be turned out. This fruit is\r\neasily grown, and is not at all subject to serious pests, so that anyone\r\nwho will take reasonable care can produce all that is required for home\r\nuse or local sale, as its softness renders it a difficult fruit to ship\r\nlong distances in a hot climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MULBERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the hardiest fruits we have, one of the most rapid\r\ngrowers, and one of the most prolific. There are several varieties in\r\ncultivation, and those of Japanese or Chinese origin will grow from the\r\ncoast to the interior, and thrive either in an extremely dry or humid\r\nclimate. The common English or black mulberry does not do too well as a\r\nrule, though there are many fine trees scattered throughout the State,\r\nbut the other sorts are as hardy as native trees. The fruit is not of\r\nany great value, still, as it is so easily grown, it finds a place in\r\nmost gardens, and in time of drought the leaves and young branches are\r\nreadily eaten by all kinds of stock, so that it is a good standby for\r\nstock as well as a fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRAWBERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo those who have been accustomed to look upon the strawberry as a fruit\r\nof the purely temperate regions, it will be somewhat of a revelation to\r\nknow that exceptionally fine fruit can be grown right on the Queensland\r\ncoast, and well within the tropics, and that on the coast, between the\r\n26th to the 28th degrees of south latitude, we are probably producing as\r\nfine fruit and obtaining as heavy crops as are produced in any of the\r\nolder strawberry-growing countries. Not only this, but that we are able\r\nto supply the Southern markets of Australia with finer fruit than they\r\ncan produce locally, and at a time of the year that they cannot grow it.\r\nAs I have already mentioned when dealing with other fruits, one thing\r\nthat particularly impresses strangers is the early age at which our\r\nfruits come into bearing. This is borne out in the case of the\r\nstrawberry to a marked degree, as runners set in April fruit in July,\r\nand often earlier, and will continue to bear, given reasonable weather,\r\nright up to Christmas or even longer. New plants are set out every\r\nyear, and the plantation is seldom allowed to stand more than two years,\r\nas the young plants produce the finest fruit. There is a good demand for\r\nthe fruit, the larger berries being packed in flat cases holding a\r\nsingle layer of fruit, as shown in the illustration, and being sold for\r\nconsumption fresh, whereas the smaller berries are packed in kegs and\r\nsent direct to the factories for conversion into jam. The strawberry\r\ngrows well on various soils, but does best with us on a rich loam of\r\nmedium texture, of a reddish-brown or even black colour. It should be\r\nplanted in districts that are free from frosts where early fruit is\r\ndesired, as frosts injure the blossoms, but where jam fruit only is\r\nwanted this is not so necessary. The land requires to be thoroughly well\r\nprepared, and the plants are usually set out in rows about 2 feet\r\napart, with the plants about 1 foot apart in the row. Under favourable\r\nconditions they grow very rapidly, and soon start flowering. Their\r\ncultivation is usually confined to comparatively small areas of 2 or 3\r\nacres in extent, as the labour of picking and packing is usually done by\r\nthe grower himself with the assistance of his family. They are often\r\nplanted between the rows of trees in young orchards, thus bringing in a\r\nreturn whilst the trees are coming into bearing, and helping to keep the\r\npot boiling. They grow well on our coastal scrub lands, and have proved\r\na great assistance to many a beginner, as one has not long to wait\r\nbefore obtaining a return.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Strawberry Garden, Mooloolah District.]\r\n\r\nThe productiveness of this fruit in Queensland is phenomenal, as high as\r\n5 tons of berries having been taken off 1 acre in a single season. There\r\nare many varieties of strawberries in cultivation, some of which have\r\nbeen produced locally from seed, and have turned out extremely well,\r\nbeing of better flavour, stronger growers, and heavier bearers than\r\nintroduced varieties--in fact, local seedlings have adapted themselves\r\nto local conditions, and stand our climate better than those varieties\r\nwhich are natives of colder countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marguerite Strawberry.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marguerite Strawberry packed for market.]\r\n\r\nThe case berries, which are used for fresh consumption, fetch a fair\r\nprice, especially early in the season, but jam fruit sells at an average\r\nof 2-1/2d. per lb., at which price it pays fair wages, but is not a\r\nbonanza. As a rule the plants are very healthy, and any fungus pests to\r\nwhich they are subject, such as leaf blight, are easily kept in check by\r\nspraying, a knapsack pump being used for this purpose. The ground is\r\nkept well worked and free from weeds, whilst the plants are fruiting,\r\nand occasionally the ground is mulched, as is the case in the plot shown\r\nin the illustration. No special knowledge is necessary for their\r\nculture, but, at the same time, thorough cultivation and careful\r\nattention to details in the growing of the plants make a considerable\r\ndifference in the total returns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forman's Strawberry, Brisbane District.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPE GOOSEBERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Peruvian fruit, introduced into this State _via_ the Cape of Good\r\nHope, hence its name, has now spread throughout the greater part of the\r\ntropical and semi-tropical portions of Queensland. Its spread has\r\nlargely been brought about by the agency of fruit-eating birds, that\r\nhave distributed the seeds widely by means of their castings. It is one\r\nof the first plants to make its appearance in newly burnt-off scrub\r\nland, and often comes up in such numbers as to give a full crop of\r\nfruit. In other cases it is usual to scatter a quantity of seed on such\r\nland, so as to be sure of securing a plant. No cultivation is given; the\r\nplant grows into a straggling bush bearing a quantity of fruit which is\r\nenclosed in a parchment-like husk. The fruit is gathered, husked, and is\r\nthen ready for market. The bulk of the fruit is grown in this manner,\r\nand as it can be grown on land that is not yet ready for any other crop\r\n(grass or maize excepted) it is a great help to the beginner, as a good\r\ncrop and fair prices can usually be obtained. The name \"gooseberry\" is\r\nsomewhat misleading, as it is not a gooseberry at all, is not like it,\r\nnor does it belong to the same natural order. It is a plant belonging to\r\nthe order Solanaceae, which includes such well-known plants as the\r\npotato, tomato, tobacco, &c., and altogether unlike the common\r\ngooseberry, which, by the way, is one of the fruits that we cannot do\r\nmuch with. In addition to being grown in the wild manner I have\r\ndescribed, it is occasionally cultivated in a systematic manner,\r\nsomewhat like the tomato, but not to any extent; growers preferring to\r\ndepend on it as a first return from newly fallen and burnt-off scrub\r\nland. As a fruit it meets with a very ready sale, as it is one of the\r\nbest cooking fruits grown; plainly stewed and served with cream, made\r\ninto puddings or pies, or converted into jam, it is hard to beat. The\r\njam has a distinct flavour of its own, one that one soon becomes very\r\npartial to, besides which it is an attractive-looking jam that, were it\r\nbetter known in the world's markets, would, I feel sure, meet with a\r\nready sale at satisfactory rates. The plant is somewhat susceptible to\r\ncold, hence it does best in a district free from frost, but it is not\r\nkilled out by light frosts, only killed back, and its crop put back.\r\nLike all plants belonging to the same natural order, it likes a good\r\nsoil, rich in available potash, and this is probably the reason why it\r\ndoes so well on newly burnt-off scrub, the ashes of which provide an\r\nample supply of available potash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA much-neglected fruit in this State, as it is also in most\r\nEnglish-speaking countries. Few English people are fond of either the\r\nfruit or the oil, and yet it is probable that there is no tree that for\r\nthe space it occupies will produce a greater annual return of food than\r\nthe olive. A number of trees are scattered throughout the State, some of\r\nwhich are now of large size and fair age, but, so far, practically\r\nnothing beyond making a few gallons of oil and pickling a few gallons of\r\nfruit has been attempted, and this only in a purely experimental manner.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the olive industry is destined to have a\r\nwakening up ere long, as a country that can produce this fruit in such\r\nquantities and of such a quality as the lighter soils of the Darling\r\nDowns is destined some day to be one of the largest producers of olives\r\non earth. Some years since I planted a number of the best varieties of\r\nolives--trees obtained direct from California--on the Darling Downs, in\r\nland that I considered suitable for their growth, and which was properly\r\nprepared prior to planting. The trees here have made a really phenomenal\r\ngrowth, they came into bearing within three years of planting, and have\r\nborne steadily ever since. They have proved enormous bearers, and an\r\nexperimental crushing showed that the oil was of high quality.\r\n\r\nThere are large areas of similar country to that in which they are\r\nplanted in different parts of the State, and I feel certain that this\r\nreally valuable food fruit is bound some day to be a considerable source\r\nof our national wealth. So far, the drawback to the growth of olives has\r\nbeen the cost of gathering the fruit and the limited demand for the oil\r\nor pickled fruit, but, against this, it has many advantages, one, and by\r\nno means the least, of which is its value as a shade and shelter tree on\r\nour open treeless plains. It is also a very hardy tree, withstanding\r\ndrought well, and thriving in land that is too stony for the cultivation\r\nof ordinary farm crops. It is a healthy tree, free from most fruit pests\r\nother than the olive scale, which can be kept in check by spraying or\r\ncyaniding; and last, but not least, it is an ornamental tree whose wood\r\nis of considerable value. The olive does best with us in loamy soils of\r\nfair depth and basaltic origin, that are moderately rich in lime and\r\npotash, and have a fair drainage. A subsoil of decomposed rock answers\r\nwell. It will, however, do on several other kinds of soil, but it is in\r\nthe type that I have just described that it does so well, and in which I\r\nwould recommend its culture on a large scale. It will stand a fair\r\namount of frost as well as great heat, and I have never seen the trees\r\ninjured by either on our Downs country. I have also seen trees doing\r\nwell right on the coast, where they have been subject to heavy\r\nrainfalls, so that it appears to adapt itself to the conditions\r\nprevailing in many parts of our State.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fruits I have briefly described, there are several\r\nothers of minor importance that can be grown successfully, but, as they\r\nare not of any great value commercially, I will leave them out, and go\r\non to the fruits of our more temperate districts, as, in addition to\r\ngrowing the tropical and semi-tropical fruits which I have already dealt\r\nwith, Queensland can also produce temperate climate fruits to a very\r\nhigh degree of perfection.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the temperate regions that we are able to grow include the\r\napple, pear, plum, prune, quince, apricot, Persian peach, nectarine,\r\nalmond, walnut, chestnut, cherry, &c., as well as some of the hardier\r\nfruits which I have classed as semi-tropical--viz., the Japanese plum,\r\npersimmon, Chickasaw plum, strawberry, &c. The districts adapted for the\r\ngrowth of the distinctly temperate fruits are mostly situated in the\r\nSouthern portion of the State, and at an elevation of from 2,000 to\r\n3,000 feet above sea-level--districts having a warm summer but a\r\ncomparatively cold winter, during which frosts are by no means uncommon,\r\nbut where snow rarely falls; a healthy climate, with warm days and cool\r\nnights, to which many visitors go during the heat of summer, when the\r\nhumidity of the coast is somewhat trying to persons not naturally\r\nrobust. The Downs country, particularly its southern or Stanthorpe end,\r\nis the most suitable; the soil is mainly of granitic origin, and is very\r\nsuitable for the growth of apples, stone fruit, and grapes, but the\r\nlatter I will deal with by themselves later on. The country is by no\r\nmeans rich from an agricultural standpoint, and is considerably broken,\r\nbut, as already stated, it is admirably adapted for the growth of fruit,\r\nand within the last ten years at least 100,000 fruit trees, mostly\r\napples, plums, and peaches, have been planted out and are doing well.\r\nThe Stanthorpe show, which is held annually during the month of\r\nFebruary, is always noted for the excellence of its fruit exhibits,\r\nwhich would be hard to beat, both for size, quality, and appearance. The\r\nfruits ripen earlier than similar varieties grown in the Southern\r\nStates, hence supply our markets at a time when there is little outside\r\ncompetition, and, consequently, meet with a ready sale at fair prices.\r\nThe fruit grown in the largest quantity is the apple, so I will deal\r\nwith it first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a description of this well-known and universally used fruit is\r\nentirely superfluous, I will confine my remarks to the types of fruit\r\ngrown, and their method of growth. Owing to the fact that our fruits\r\nripen much earlier than similar varieties in more southern parts of\r\nAustralia, we have gone in largely for early varieties of apples, both\r\nfor cooking and table use, but have not confined our attention to them\r\nentirely, as good-keeping sorts are found to do equally well, and have\r\nbeen shown at the annual exhibition that is held in Brisbane during\r\nAugust, in perfect condition, showing that the fruit has good keeping\r\nqualities. The soil on which the apple is mostly grown is largely\r\ncomposed of granitic matter, and is of a sharp, sandy, loamy nature,\r\noften of a gritty character. It is usually rich in potash, the\r\npredominating felspar being orthoclase, but somewhat deficient in\r\nnitrogen and phosphoric acid. It is usually easy to work, of fair depth,\r\nand retains moisture well when kept in a thorough state of tilth. The\r\ntrees are usually planted at from 20 to 25 feet apart each way, when\r\nthey are either one year or two years old from the graft or bud. They\r\nare headed low, so as to shade the ground from the heat of the sun, and\r\nalso so as to facilitate the handling of the crop when grown, as well as\r\nto prevent their swaying about with the wind. The trees make a rapid\r\ngrowth, come into bearing very early, often bearing a fair crop three\r\nyears after planting, and fruiting even earlier. The fruit of the early\r\nvarieties has usually a handsome appearance, but lacks keeping\r\nqualities, but the later fruits are both handsome, high-coloured fruit,\r\nand good keepers. The trees are not very liable to disease, as, thanks\r\nto all varieties being worked on blight-resistant stocks, there is very\r\nlittle American blight (woolly aphis). Scale insects do a certain amount\r\nof damage, but are easily kept in check by winter spraying, and codling\r\nmoth is not bad unless grossly neglected, many orchards being quite free\r\nfrom this great pest of the apple-grower. So far, the growing of apples\r\nhas been confined entirely to the growing of fruit for the local\r\nmarkets, no attempt having been made to export same. A very small\r\nquantity is dried, and a little is used for jelly.\r\n\r\nMany varieties of apples have been tested in this State, but growers\r\nhave found out that it pays them best to confine their attention to\r\ncomparatively few sorts that have proved to be the best suited to the\r\nsoil and climate, as a few good kinds are much more profitable to grow\r\nthan a mere collection of varieties. Many varieties are prone to\r\noverbear, and trees of large size have produced enormous crops of fruit,\r\nwhereas young trees frequently break down under the weight of their\r\ncrop. The usual plan is to plant a few varieties that ripen in\r\nsuccession, so as to extend the season over as long a period as\r\npossible, and not to cause a glutted market at any one time. Early\r\nfruits particularly are not noted for their keeping qualities, and a\r\nmarket glutted with such would entail a heavy loss to growers, hence a\r\nsuccession of varieties that suit the district as well as the market is\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nNearly all kinds of apples do well, those that are resistant to the\r\nattack of woolly aphis are, however, generally chosen in preference,\r\neven though they may not be of the highest quality, as their\r\nprolificness and freedom from this pest renders them more profitable\r\nthan varieties of superior quality that are liable to blight, and that\r\nare at the same time often somewhat indifferent bearers. It is outside\r\nthe scope of this paper to go into the question of varieties, but I may\r\nmention that such sorts as Irish Peach, Gravenstein, Summer Scarlet\r\nPearmain, Twenty-ounces, Jonathan, Lord Suffield, Rome Beauty, and\r\nPrince Bismarck do remarkably well, and many other well-known kinds can\r\nbe grown to perfection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prince of Pippins Apple, Darling Downs District.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis king of the temperate fruits grows with us to perfection. The tree\r\nis hardy, a rapid grower, comes into bearing early, and is, if anything,\r\ninclined to overbear. It can be grown over a considerable part of our\r\ncoastal and inland downs, as well as the Stanthorpe district, and\r\nthrives in many kinds of soil, from light sandy loams of poor quality to\r\nrich loams of medium texture or even heavier. In this State, the peach\r\nis always grown on peach roots, the desired variety being either budded\r\nor grafted on to a seedling peach, and the resulting tree is planted out\r\nwhen it has made one year's growth. No tree is easier to grow, but if\r\nthe best returns are desired, it requires very careful pruning for the\r\nfirst three years, after which an annual winter pruning is usually all\r\nthat is necessary. The young tree is such a strong grower that unless it\r\nis heavily cut back it becomes top-heavy and breaks to pieces with the\r\nweight of fruit, but when hard cut back for the first two years, so that\r\nit has a good main stem and strong primary branches, it will form a\r\nstrong tree, and stand up well under a heavy crop of fruit. The strong\r\ngrowth it makes necessitates heavy pruning when large fruit is\r\ndesired--and it is large showy fruit which sells best here--as were the\r\ntree allowed to go unpruned, it would bear enormous numbers of fruit,\r\nmany of which would be of small size. Growers now realise this, and many\r\nof our orchards are well pruned, whereas a few years since the trees\r\nwere allowed to grow pretty much as they like.\r\n\r\nThe peach remains profitable much longer here than it does in\r\nCalifornia, as the trees do not wear out so quickly, the roots remaining\r\nsound up to the last, so that, unless the top is too far gone, the life\r\nof the tree may usually be extended for several years by heading hard\r\nback and forming an entirely new head to the tree. Trees in full bearing\r\noften produce fully 1,000 lb. weight of fruit in a single season. This\r\nis, of course, very much above the average, but by no means exceptional.\r\nWhen in their third season, they should bear enough to pay for all\r\nworking expenses.\r\n\r\nA very large number of varieties have been tested in Queensland, most of\r\nwhich do well, but, as in the case of apples, we find from experience\r\nthat it is best to stick to a few kinds, and those that have proved to\r\nbe most suitable to our soil and climate, rather than to experiment with\r\na large number of varieties.\r\n\r\nThe usual plan is to plant a number of varieties that ripen in\r\nsuccession, as with the apple, so as to spread the season over as long a\r\ntime as possible, and to stick to kinds that bear well, look well, and\r\nship well, for appearance will usually beat quality, and fetch more\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nSo far, little has been done in the way of utilising the peach, as the\r\ndemand for the fresh fruit has been equal to our supply. There is,\r\nhowever, no reason why we should not be able to establish and maintain\r\na fair canning and drying trade, should the production overcome the\r\ndemand for the fresh fruit, as our peaches are of large size, and will\r\ncan and dry well--that is to say, varieties adapted to those purposes\r\nwill do so.\r\n\r\nThe nectarine, which is simply a smooth-skinned peach, does equally\r\nwell, many varieties bear heavily, and some produce fruit of exceptional\r\nmerit. I have seen as fine nectarines grown in the Stanthorpe district\r\nas I have met with in any part of Australia or America, fruit of large\r\nsize and the highest flavour, that compared favourably with the finest\r\nhothouse-grown fruit of the Old World.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Peach Avenue, Darling Downs District.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, plums of Japanese and American origin (Chickasaw)\r\ndo well in the more coastal districts. They also bear heavily on our\r\ncoastal downs and more western country, but some kinds of Japanese plums\r\nblossom too early for the Stanthorpe district. European plums, however,\r\ndo well, and are heavy bearers. All kinds do not bear heavily, the\r\nfreest bearers being those of the damson family--White Magnum Bonum and\r\nDiamond type. Prunes also do well. Plums of European origin do best in\r\nthe coldest districts, but their cultivation is not confined entirely to\r\nthese, as some varieties thrive well in warmer and drier parts of the\r\ncountry. So far, there has been a ready sale for all the plums we can\r\nproduce for fresh consumption, excepting some of the smaller plums of\r\nthe damson type, which have been converted into jam. It is not a fruit,\r\nhowever, in which there is much money, as it is too easily grown in the\r\nSouthern States, and can there be converted into jam or canned at a\r\nlower rate than we can do here, hence our cultivation will be more or\r\nless confined to the growing of large fruits for supplying our local\r\nmarkets rather than to the production of the fruit in quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APRICOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost varieties of this fruit do well on our coastal downs country in the\r\nSouth, and to a certain extent further west. The trees are very rapid\r\ngrowers, and bear heavily. The earlier ripening fruit usually escapes\r\ndamage from fruit fly, but the late fruit often suffers considerably.\r\n\r\nThe apricot does best in a fairly strong rich soil, when it makes a\r\ngreat growth, and bears heavy crops of large-sized fruit. It also does\r\nwell on sandier soils, which produce a firmer and better-drying fruit.\r\nSo far, although a number of trees are planted throughout the State, the\r\ncultivation of the fruit is mainly confined to the production of table\r\nfruit, drying or canning having been carried out to a small extent only.\r\nThe apricot grows to a large tree, and lives to a good old age. Like the\r\npeach, it is a very vigorous grower when young, requiring severe pruning\r\nin consequence, but, when once shaped, the trees require little in the\r\nway of pruning other than the removal of superfluous branches and an\r\nannual shortening in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueensland is almost outside the limit of the successful growth of this\r\nfruit, but not quite, as we produce the first fruit to ripen in\r\nAustralia, which realises a high price on account of its earliness. Many\r\nvarieties have been tested, but, so far, no one variety can be said to\r\nbe a complete success in our climate, nor do the trees grow to the large\r\nsize or produce as heavily as they do in the Southern States, where the\r\nwinters are more clearly defined than they are in Queensland. Another\r\ndrawback to the growth of this fruit is that the soils of our coldest\r\ndistrict are not the best of cherry soils. The cherry likes a deep,\r\nmoderately rich loam, whereas we are growing it mostly on sandy loams of\r\na granitic origin. What fruit we do grow is good, and pays well on\r\naccount of its earliness, but I do not consider that this State will\r\never be able to compete with the South in the growth of the cherry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Litchi, Mossman District.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany kinds of pears do well, but, unfortunately, this fine fruit is very\r\nliable to be attacked by fruit fly. It does well generally in the\r\ndistricts that I have mentioned as suitable for the apple, plum, and\r\napricot. The tree is healthy, grows rapidly and to a large size. It\r\ncomes into bearing remarkably early as compared with the pear in colder\r\nclimates, and produces excellent fruit. I have grown as good Bartletts\r\nhere as could be obtained anywhere, and the trees have proved to be good\r\nbearers and doers. This fruit does best on deep soils of a medium to\r\nstrong loamy nature, and of good quality, though it does well in much\r\nfreer soils, but does not make as good a growth or bear as heavily. It\r\nis usually grown on seedling-pear stocks, but the growing of suitable\r\nvarieties on quince stocks and keeping the resultant trees dwarfed is to\r\nbe recommended. This method of growing the pear does well here, and\r\ndwarf trees can be easily protected from fly, whereas it is practically\r\nimpossible to deal with big trees, which the pear becomes when grown on\r\npear roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fruit does well in parts of our coastal tableland country, though\r\nits habit of blossoming too early in the season renders it very liable\r\nto injury from late frosts. The trees do remarkably well, grow rapidly,\r\nand bear heavily when the blossoms are uninjured by frost, hence it is a\r\ngood tree to grow in selected situations containing suitable soil, as it\r\ncommands a ready sale, and is very little troubled with pests. A free,\r\nsandy, loamy soil is best suited to the growth of the almond, and the\r\nsituation should be well protected from frost. The trees are usually\r\nworked on peach stocks, on which they make a very rapid growth. Several\r\nvarieties should be grown together, as a better set of fruit will be\r\nobtained by doing so, most almonds requiring the pollen of another\r\nvariety flowering at the same time to render their flowers fertile. The\r\nalmond grows into a handsome, shapely tree, and, when in blossom, an\r\norchard is a sight not easily forgotten, the wealth of flowers being\r\nsuch that it must be seen to be fully appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe walnut, chestnut, quince, blackberry, raspberry, and one or two\r\nother fruits of the temperate regions are also cultivated to a small\r\nextent, but are of no great value so far, though there is no reason why\r\nthe walnut, which does well with us, should not be cultivated to a much\r\ngreater extent than it is, as there is always a fair demand for the\r\nnuts. Blackberries of different kinds have been introduced, and do well,\r\nthe common English blackberry almost too well, as unless kept in check\r\nit is apt to spread to such an extent as to be a nuisance. In addition\r\nto the cultivated fruits I have briefly mentioned as growing in\r\nQueensland, we have a number of native fruits growing in our scrubs and\r\nelsewhere that are worthy of cultivation with a view to their ultimate\r\nimprovement. Of such are the Queensland nut, a handsome evergreen tree,\r\nbearing heavy crops of a very fine flavoured nut. The nut is about\r\n3/4-inch in diameter, but the shell is very hard and thick. It could no\r\ndoubt be improved by selection and careful breeding. The Davidsonian\r\nplum is also another fruit of promise. It is a handsome tree of our\r\ntropical North coast, and bears a large plum-shaped fruit of a dark\r\npurple colour, with dark reddish purple flesh, which is extremely acid,\r\nbut which is well worth cultivation. Several species of eugenias also\r\nproduce edible fruit, and there are two species of wild raspberries\r\ncommon to our scrubs. There are the native citrus fruits I referred to\r\nin an earlier part of this paper, as well as several other less\r\nwell-known fruits that are edible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tamarind Tree, Port Douglas District.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPE CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo work on fruit-growing in Queensland, however small, would be complete\r\nwithout due reference being made to the vine, the last but by no means\r\nthe least important of our many fruits. Although the cultivation of this\r\nmost useful and popular fruit has not reached to anything like the\r\ndimensions that vine culture has attained in the Southern States,\r\nparticularly in the production of wine, there is no reason why it should\r\nnot do so at no very distant future. We have many advantages not\r\npossessed by our Southern neighbours in the culture of the grape, the\r\nfirst and most important of which is that our crop ripens so much\r\nearlier than that of the South that we can secure the whole of the early\r\nmarkets without fear of any serious opposition. Until quite recently,\r\ngrape culture was in a very backward state in Queensland, the grapes\r\ngrown on the coast being nearly all American varieties, which are by no\r\nmeans the best wine or table sorts. A few grapes of European origin were\r\ngrown on the Downs and in the Roma district, but their cultivation was\r\npractically confined thereto. Now, however, things have altered very\r\nmuch for the better. Many good varieties of European grapes have been\r\nproved suitable to the coastal climate of the Southern half of the\r\nState, and many inland districts other than Roma and the Downs have also\r\nproved that they, too, can and do grow first-class fruit both for table\r\nand wine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grosse Koelner Vine in Fruit, Roma District (Gros\r\nColman).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Picking Grapes, Roma.]\r\n\r\nNow the culture of the grape extends over a great part of the State,\r\nfrom the coast to the interior; in the latter, its successful growth\r\ndepending on the necessary suitable water for irrigation, and on the\r\ncoast to our knowledge of how to keep fungus pests, such as anthracnose,\r\nin check by winter treatment and spring spraying.\r\n\r\nIn the Brisbane district many kinds of excellent table grapes are now\r\ngrown, which meet with a ready sale, such as the well-known Black\r\nHamburgh of English vineries, the Sweetwater, Snow's Muscat Hamburgh,\r\nRoyal Ascot, &c., as well as all the better kinds of American grapes,\r\nsuch as Iona, Goethe, Wilder, &c. A little wine is made, but more\r\nattention is given to table fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Grape Vine in Fruit, Stanthorpe District.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Madresfield Court Grape.]\r\n\r\nIn the Maryborough, Gympie, and Bundaberg districts, similar grapes are\r\nalso grown, and do well, ripening somewhat earlier than they do in\r\nBrisbane; and in the Rockhampton district, right on the tropic of\r\nCapricorn, some of the best table grapes I have seen in the State are\r\nproduced. Further north a few grapes are grown, but not in any great\r\nquantities, and I consider that the profitable cultivation of good table\r\ngrapes on the coast extends from our Southern border to a short distance\r\nnorth of the tropic of Capricorn and inland to all districts where there\r\nis either a sufficient rainfall or a supply of water from artesian\r\nbores, or otherwise, to enable them to be grown. Grapes here, as in\r\nother parts of the world, like moderately rich, free, loamy soils of\r\ngood depth, free sandy loams, and free alluvial loams. In such soils\r\nthey make a vigorous growth, and are heavy bearers. The granitic soils\r\nof the Stanthorpe district, that produce such good peaches, plums, and\r\napples, grow excellent grapes, which ripen late. They are of large size,\r\nand conspicuous for their fine colour. The sandy soils of Roma and the\r\nMaranoa country generally grow excellent wine and table grapes, the\r\nlatter being of large size, full flavour, and handsome appearance. Wine\r\ngrapes also do well here, and some excellent wine has been made, both\r\ndark and light, natural and fortified. I have no doubt that eventually\r\ngood rich port and the best of sherries will be produced in this\r\ndistrict, as the soil and climate are admirably adapted to the\r\nproduction of these classes of wine. Our difficulty, so far, has been to\r\nfind out the exact kinds of grapes to grow for this purpose, but now I\r\nam glad to say that we are on the right track, and the excellence of\r\nQueensland ports and sherries will be a recognised thing before many\r\nyears are past. There is a big and good opening for up-to-date\r\nviticulturists in this State. We have any amount of suitable land at low\r\nrates, and, thanks to the generous sun heat of our interior, we can grow\r\ngrapes capable of producing wines equal to the best that can be turned\r\nout by Spain, Portugal, or Madeira. In those districts that do not\r\npossess such an extreme climate, such as the coastal downs and the\r\nStanthorpe districts, good wines of a lighter character can be produced,\r\nand, as already stated, good wines are now being made on the coast.\r\n\r\nIt is only now that we are beginning to realise the value of the grape\r\nto Queensland, as, until our production increased to such an extent that\r\nour local markets were being over-supplied, our growers made no attempt\r\nto supply outside markets. Now this is being done, and better means of\r\nhandling and packing the fruit, so as to enable it to be shipped long\r\ndistances, are now coming into vogue. With improved methods of handling\r\nand packing, we have a greatly extended market, in which we will have no\r\nlocal competition, hence will be able to secure good returns, so much so\r\nthat I consider that grape-growing in Queensland has a very promising\r\noutlook for some years to come at any rate. In addition to growing\r\ngrapes to supply the fresh-fruit trade and for winemaking, our western\r\ncountry is capable of producing good raisins and sultanas. So far, this\r\nindustry has not been entered into commercially, the fresh fruit\r\nrealising far too high a price for it to pay to convert it into raisins.\r\nStill, with increased production, this will have to take place, and when\r\nit does I am of opinion that we will be able to turn out a very saleable\r\narticle. The growing of grapes here certainly requires considerable\r\nexperience of a practical nature. This is not at all hard to obtain, and\r\nthere are no insurmountable difficulties to the beginner, once he has\r\nlearnt how to work his land so as to cause it to retain moisture during\r\na dry spell, and to plant and prune his vines. These are matters in\r\nwhich any beginner can obtain practical advice from the Queensland\r\nAgricultural Department, as the Government of Queensland, recognising\r\nthe importance of fruit-growing, grape-growing, and general agriculture\r\nto the State, have devoted considerable sums of money to the\r\nestablishment of experiment farms, orchards, and vineyards in different\r\nparts of the State. All these Government institutions are under the\r\ncontrol of thoroughly qualified managers, who are willing at all times\r\nto give any assistance to beginners, thereby enabling the latter to keep\r\nfree from mistakes, and to obtain the best returns as the result of\r\ntheir labour. Instructors, thoroughly conversant with the State as a\r\nwhole, are also available for giving practical advice, so that there is\r\nno necessity for a beginner, through lack of experience, to waste any\r\ntime in finding out for himself what his soil and climate are suited\r\nfor. He can start on the right lines from the beginning, and keep to\r\nright lines if he will only take advantage of the advice, based on\r\npractical experience, that is given him. Queensland is a good land for\r\nthe intending fruit-grower. We offer you good soil, a choice of\r\nclimates, suitable for the growing of practically every kind of\r\ncommercial fruit, a healthy climate to live in, cheap land, free\r\neducation for your children, and free advice from competent experts for\r\nyourselves. This is a country that has not been advertised or puffed up;\r\nthat is, in consequence, not by any means well known; but it is a\r\ncountry that, taken all in all, will take a lot of beating when one is\r\nlooking out for a home.
