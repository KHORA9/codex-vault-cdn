The arrival and departure of this\r\ntrain was the event of the day to most of the inhabitants, not only of\r\nPoppicombe, but of the surrounding villages.  There were quite\r\nhalf-a-dozen people standing on the platform, and the station staff,\r\nconsisting of two men and a boy, were moving about briskly.  One man\r\nwas busily engaged in handing various newspapers and packages, which\r\nhad been thrown from the guard's van, to the people who had been\r\nawaiting them; the other man, the stationmaster, was exchanging a few\r\nwords with the guard, at the end of the platform; while the boy porter,\r\nlooking about disconsolately for some doors to bang, distinguished\r\nhimself by suddenly slamming the open door of the luggage van, much to\r\nthe astonishment of the guard.  As soon as the train had rumbled away,\r\nthe young porter seized a newspaper from a pile standing on a trolly,\r\nopened it at a particular page, and, after reading a few words, let\r\nforth a wild war-whoop.  Then, in spite of the glare in the\r\nstationmaster's eye, he rushed madly out of the station and looked\r\nexcitedly up Longhill Avenue.  There in the distance he saw, coming\r\nslowly towards the station, a young girl of twelve or thirteen years of\r\nage, seated upon a sturdy Exmoor pony.  Although she sat her mount with\r\nthe ease that comes only to the born rider, a close observer would have\r\nnoticed that the slight droop about her slim young shoulders became\r\nmore pronounced as she neared her destination.  She was dressed in\r\nblack, and her plain wide-brimmed sailor hat was trimmed only with a\r\nnarrow band of crape.\r\n\r\nShe rode forward with an eye that seemed to ignore all outward objects,\r\nher thin, small-featured face betokening a mood of deep despondency.\r\nHer errand had been the same for many days, and day after day she had\r\nmet with nothing but disappointment.  A few weeks ago she had taken the\r\njourney at a canter.  Now, in spite of her natural high spirits, Tommy,\r\nas she was called by her family and friends, held the reins in such a\r\nlistless fashion that the pony merely sauntered through the Avenue, as\r\nthough he too shared her depression.  Her lack of vigour was perhaps\r\nthe more noticeable because her thin, wiry body looked framed for\r\nenergy.  There was an unmistakable air of health about the young\r\ngirlish figure, but Tommy, although she was quite unconscious of it,\r\nwas suffering from fatigue of the spirit.  She had borne up bravely\r\nenough at first, but successive daily disappointments had at length\r\nproved too much for her.\r\n\r\nNow Longhill Avenue does not belie its name.  It has a hill, and the\r\nhill is long and gently sloping, with rows of tall chestnut-trees on\r\neither side.  When Tommy had reached the foot of the hill, she suddenly\r\nbecame aware that some one was shouting lustily.  She started, and\r\nlooking up quickly, saw a quaint little figure, dressed in corduroys,\r\nwith a peaked cap much too large for him, wildly waving a paper, and\r\nrushing towards her from the station yard as fast as hobnailed boots\r\nallowed.  She touched up her pony and was soon within hail of the\r\nfreckled, rosy-cheeked young porter, whose face was spread abroad with\r\nsmiles.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, miss, her be sound as bacon,\" he gasped breathlessly.\r\n\"See then!\" he added, and as Tommy came nearer to him he pointed with a\r\ngrimy thumb to the Shipping Intelligence column of the newspaper which\r\nhe had snatched from the pile at the station.\r\n\r\nTommy took the paper, and, scanning the paragraph eagerly, read: \"The\r\nbarque Elizabeth, thirty days overdue from Valparaiso, spoken by the\r\nliner Kildonan Castle, in the Bay of Biscay; all well.\"\r\n\r\nAs she read these few lines, the whole expression of Tommy's face\r\nchanged.  Her dark eyes brightened; a wave of gladness seemed to surge\r\nthrough her as she drew herself erect in the saddle.  The smile about\r\nthe corners of her rather wide but sweet-looking mouth deepened, and\r\neven her hair, which had appeared dispirited a few moments ago, now\r\ncurled itself more tightly about her small dainty head.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! won't they be glad!\" she ejaculated in her clear, brisk voice.\r\n\"Dan, you're a cherub,\" she cried, \"a perfect cherub; you are indeed,\r\nDan;\" and, turning her pony about, was off like the wind.\r\n\r\nDan Whiddon watched her admiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Her do be mortal pleased,\" he said to himself, \"and her naming me\r\n'cherub' be her way o' saying 'thankee,' I reckon.  'Cherub,' says she.\r\nNow what will old Berry be calling I?\"\r\n\r\nHe clumped heavily back to the station.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you young stunpoll,\" cried the stationmaster sternly, \"what do\r\n'ee mean by rampaging off like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Tommy's uncle bean't a dead 'un arter all, I reckon,\" said the\r\nboy.  \"His ship be behind time, that's all, and he'll be coming\r\ndown-along soon.\"\r\n\r\nDan's reply was not a particularly lucid one, but as anybody's business\r\nwas everybody's business in Poppicombe, the station-master had no\r\ndifficulty in understanding the youth.  He warned Dan of the evil\r\neffects of not minding one's own business, and crossing the line,\r\nentered into a long discussion with his ticket-clerk concerning Miss\r\nTommy and her private affairs.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tommy was galloping at breakneck speed the four miles which\r\nled to her home.  About a quarter of a mile from Plum-Tree Farm, where\r\nthe Westmacott family, Tommy's people, had lived for generations, she\r\nespied her sisters standing at the gate leading into the paddock.  They\r\nhad heard the sound of the quick tramp of the pony's hoofs in the\r\ndistance, and had rushed out to see why Tommy on this particular day\r\nwas riding so furiously.  On catching sight of them she repeated, in\r\nher own inimitable way, Dan's method of breaking the good news.  She\r\nyelled at the top of her voice, and waved the newspaper high above her\r\nhead.  So excited was she that she almost threw the newspaper at her\r\nelder sister, and it dropped in a puddle formed by the recent rains.\r\nTommy was off the saddle in a moment, and leaving the pony to find his\r\nway to the stable, she picked up the fallen paper, and wiping the dirt\r\nfrom it with her pocket-handkerchief, gave it triumphantly to her tall,\r\ndark, handsome sister Elizabeth, whilst Mary, the second girl, drawing\r\nnearer to Elizabeth's side, stood quietly waiting.\r\n\r\nThe three girls bore a certain family likeness to each other, but the\r\ndifferences were almost equally striking.  The two eldest were tall and\r\nslim, and had the same dark-coloured eyes, but there the resemblance\r\nceased.  In character they were as far apart as the poles.  Elizabeth,\r\ncalled after her mother, who had died when Tommy was only a few months\r\nold, was a capable girl of nineteen years of age, with a magnificent\r\nhead of rich dark hair, and deep-blue eyes.  Her manner was grave and\r\nquiet.  She had been a mother to the two younger girls ever since she\r\ncould remember, and responsibility had made her old for her years.  Her\r\nfather, too, had made her his constant companion, and she had been his\r\nright hand in managing the farm and keeping the accounts during the\r\nyears that had preceded his death a few months before.  Mary, the\r\nsecond girl, who had just turned fifteen, was as fair as Elizabeth was\r\ndark, but with the same deep-coloured starry eyes.  She was the most\r\nstudious of the three, and it was always a great delight to Tommy, when\r\nshe found her lost in some book of travel or adventure, to awaken her\r\nfrom her dreams by forming a mouthpiece with her hands and shouting in\r\npoor Mary's ear, \"Hallo! are you there?\"  But Tommy's winning smile\r\nalways disarmed Mary's wrath, and, in spite of constant small\r\ndisagreements, the two were excellent friends.\r\n\r\nThe youngest girl, Katherine, our friend Tommy, was thin and wiry in\r\nbuild, somewhat short for her years, with small black twinkling eyes,\r\nand a little head running over with golden curls.  Her chief\r\ncharacteristic so far was an endless capacity for getting into scrapes.\r\nA demon of mischief always seemed lurking in the twinkling depths of\r\nher merry eyes.  Just now they danced with excitement, as she said:\r\n\"Well, of all the cool customers you must be the coolest, Mary, to\r\nstand there waiting, and never to change a hair, or look over the paper\r\nin Elizabeth's hand, or anything.  Oh dear!  Oh dear! what can you be\r\nmade of?  Dear old Uncle Ben is coming home, coming home, coming home!\"\r\nand catching Mary by the waist, she sang, \"Waltz me round, Mary, waltz\r\nme round,\" and twirled her sister round and round until she was\r\ncompletely out of breath.\r\n\r\n\"Do make her stop it, Bess,\" besought Mary gaspingly.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy darling, do try to be a bit sensible,\" said Elizabeth, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Not I!\" said Tommy, \"why should be sensible?\" as she gave Mary's\r\npigtail a tug.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, recognizing Tommy's mood, and fearing there would be\r\n\"ructions\" presently, tactfully put her arm about her gay-hearted,\r\nmischievous small sister, and led the way indoors.\r\n\r\nThis was not the first time by any means that Elizabeth had acted as\r\npeacemaker in the Westmacott family.  When she was quite a child, and\r\nTommy a mere baby, she had often been called by Mrs. Pratt, the\r\nhousekeeper, to see if she could induce \"that plaguy young limb\" to\r\nbehave herself.  Later on, Elizabeth had, times without number, pleaded\r\nwith her father not to be so angry, or quite so severe, with his\r\nyoungest girl, however trying the child might be; and Mr. Westmacott,\r\nseeing that Elizabeth thoroughly understood \"the imp of mischief,\" as\r\nhe called her the day he had been obliged to summon all hands on the\r\nfarm to rescue her and her pony from a bog, left her more and more to\r\nhis eldest daughter's care.  Then when Tommy was old enough to\r\naccompany her sisters to \"lessons\" at the Vicarage, again Elizabeth had\r\nto pour oil on troubled waters, for the vicar, an old friend of her\r\nfather's, who had undertaken the education of the three girls, and\r\nwhose word had hitherto been taken as law, often became very irritable\r\nwhen Tommy would argue instead of accepting facts.  As Tommy increased\r\nin stature, she became, under Elizabeth's wise guidance, more and more\r\namenable to reason, but she never lost her absolute fearlessness and\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nAll the girls had been encouraged by their father to live an open-air\r\nlife, and Tommy always led the way instinctively whenever they went\r\nriding, driving, rowing and fishing.  The farmhouse was the old manor\r\nhouse.  The huge kitchen, with its deep-seated fireplace and\r\nlow-raftered oak-beamed ceiling, was now used as a living-room.  It had\r\nthree deep bay windows, each looking across the flower garden on to the\r\nmoors.  The breath of autumn was in the air, but the hollyhocks and\r\ngladioli still flaunted their gay colours, as though they refused to\r\nown that summer had ended.  The garden was Elizabeth's special pride;\r\nshe loved to keep it an old-fashioned, old-world garden, and had\r\nherself planted sweet peas and stocks, and the spiked gillyflower,\r\namongst the lavender bushes and the oleanders.  In fact, after her\r\nfather's death, when Elizabeth had found that his assets were really\r\n\"nil,\" owing to a succession of bad crops and the cattle-disease\r\nspreading so rapidly among the kine, she had had serious thoughts of\r\ntrying to take up gardening as a profession, but on talking it over\r\nwith her sisters they agreed that it would be better to wait until the\r\nreturn of their uncle.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barton was their mother's only brother.  He was a deep-sea\r\ncaptain, and at the time of his brother-in-law's death he was sailing\r\nin mid-Pacific.  But at the first port the vessel had touched, he had\r\nreceived a letter from his eldest niece, telling him the sad news, and\r\nhow things were with them, and asking him to come to them as soon as he\r\ncould.  He had answered the letter at once, and in his reply had done\r\nhis best to hearten them.  He had advised Elizabeth to see the\r\nlandlord, place the facts before him, and ask him if he would allow the\r\nrent to be in abeyance until her uncle arrived.  The landlord had\r\nconsented, knowing the family so well, and so one great worry had for a\r\ntime been taken off Elizabeth's young shoulders.  She was not obliged\r\nto remove at once, but they all knew that it was impossible to keep on\r\nthe farm, even had it been paying, and several evenings were passed by\r\nthe three girls in wondering what they could do so as not to be a\r\nburden upon their uncle.  Mary had spoken of teaching, but there would\r\nbe no money to pay for the necessary training, so that idea had to be\r\ngiven up.  Tommy had a new idea about every other day as to what she'd\r\ndo in order to make the family fortune.  One day she burnt three of the\r\nsaucepans, scalded herself rather badly, and made everything around her\r\n\"sticky,\" by trying to invent a new kind of jam.  Another day she\r\nconcocted the Westmacott Cure for sick headache, and insisted upon her\r\nsisters tasting the \"awful mixture,\" which she assured them was\r\nharmless, and was quite annoyed when Elizabeth and Mary advised her not\r\nto invent anything else for a few years.\r\n\r\nSo the days went on, the girls busying themselves about the farm and\r\nlonging eagerly for the return of the only relation they had in the\r\nworld.  Captain Barton had given them the probable date of his arrival\r\nat Plymouth, but when the expected day came and passed without any\r\nfurther news from him, they had all become more and more anxious and\r\nalarmed, wondering if his vessel had gone down with all hands and left\r\nno trace of her whereabouts.  Hence Tommy's excitement and delight, and\r\nElizabeth and Mary's quiet joy, on hearing that their uncle was coming\r\nto them at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nUNCLE BEN\r\n\r\nDuring the next three days the girls were restless with excitement.\r\nUncle Ben would, they were sure, send them a telegram as soon as he\r\nreached Plymouth, and one or another of them was constantly on the\r\nlook-out for the messenger from the little village postoffice.  They\r\nturned out the spare bedroom, and had a grand clean-up; hung fresh\r\ncurtains, aired mattress and bedclothes, and made things shipshape, as\r\nhe would say, in anticipation of Uncle Ben's arrival.  On the third day\r\nthe girl at the post-office rode up on her bicycle with the little\r\nbrown envelope.  Tommy flew to meet her, and in another moment was\r\nrunning back to the house crying, \"Coming to-morrow!  To-morrow!\" at\r\nthe top of her voice.\r\n\r\nOf course they drove down to the station next day fully an hour before\r\nthe train was due.  Tommy beguiled the time by weighing her sisters and\r\nherself on the station weighing-machine, looked in at the\r\nbooking-office, ran to the signal-box and asked to be allowed to work\r\nthe levers, and in other ways acted up to her reputation.\r\n\r\nAt last the train was signalled.  The three girls looked eagerly down\r\nthe line.  Presently the engine rounded the curve nearly half-a-mile\r\naway, and as the train rumbled along the straight line towards the\r\nstation, a red bandana handkerchief was seen vigorously waving at the\r\nwindow of a compartment in the centre.\r\n\r\n\"There he is!\" cried Tommy, dancing with excitement, and waving her\r\nhandkerchief in return.\r\n\r\n\"Stand back, miss,\" called the station-master, as she stepped near the\r\nedge of the platform.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I shan't hurt your old engine,\" replied Tommy, who, nevertheless,\r\nallowed her sisters to take a hand each until the train came to a\r\nstandstill.  Then she darted towards the compartment from which issued\r\na short, stoutish man, with a jolly, red face, short, close-trimmed\r\nbeard, and eyes ready to light up with fun at the slightest provocation.\r\n\r\nCaptain Benjamin Barton was a sailor of the good old-fashioned sort.\r\nHe had been to sea ever since he was thirteen, when he had run away to\r\nPlymouth after an exchange of discourtesies with the classical master\r\nat the Grammar School: he never could abide Latin.  During nearly fifty\r\nyears of life at sea he had saved a considerable sum, and had become\r\npart owner of his vessel, besides having shares in several others.  He\r\nstill loyally stuck to the sailing ship; the steamship had no\r\nattractions for him; and he was never tired of comparing the two, to\r\nthe great disadvantage of the more modern type.  Tommy once said that\r\nhe reminded her of the 'bus-driver behind whom she had sat when on her\r\nonly visit to London, who had spoken with the bitterest scorn of the\r\nmotor omnibus.  The captain's twinkling black eyes gleamed with fun\r\nwhen Tommy assured him artlessly that the 'busman was \"just such a dear\r\nold stick-in-the-mud\" as he was.  Tommy sprang into his arms as he got\r\nout of the railway carriage.  He gradually extricated himself from her\r\nembrace, and turning to his elder nieces, silently kissed them.  In\r\nspite of a brave attempt at cheerfulness his eyes were rather dim as he\r\nmumbled a word of greeting.  He had always been on the best of terms\r\nwith their father, and, when he was ashore, had been accustomed to make\r\nthe farm his headquarters.  The loss of his brother-in-law had come as\r\na great shock to him; and the remembrance of it, together with the\r\nmeeting with the three fatherless girls, almost unmanned him for the\r\nmoment.  The red bandana handkerchief came into play again; he blew his\r\nnose furiously, declared that railway travelling always gave him a\r\ncold, and turning on Dan Whiddon, the small porter, who was staggering\r\nunder a trunk he had taken from the compartment, he cried--\r\n\r\n\"Now, young Samson, don't be too rough with that little contraption of\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\nThe aggrieved look on Dan's face set them laughing, and the tension was\r\nrelieved.  They passed out of the station, and came to the little farm\r\nwagonette.  Tommy was usually driver, but as there was only room for\r\none on the driver's seat, and she declared that she was going to sit\r\nwith Uncle, Elizabeth good-naturedly offered to take the reins.  When\r\nthe Captain, the other girls, and the trunk were packed in behind, it\r\nwas a tight squeeze, and Dan Whiddon, rejoicing in twopence, surveyed\r\nthe pony doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"You'm better get out and walk up t' hill,\" he suggested, with the\r\nfamiliarity of an old friend.\r\n\r\n\"Be off and buy your sweeties, Samson,\" said the Captain, \"or we'll\r\nhitch you on as leader.\"  And laughing at his own jest, Uncle Ben\r\nsqueezed Mary with his right arm, and Tommy with his left, and called\r\nto Elizabeth to get under way.\r\n\r\nThere was little talking on the homeward drive.  The younger girls were\r\nquite happy nestling against their uncle; and he was thinking of his\r\nmany former home-comings.  But when he entered the bright farm parlour,\r\nand saw the spread tea-table, and the blazing fire which Mrs. Pratt had\r\nkindled--then his jolly weather-worn face glowed, and he cried, in the\r\nsame words he had used a score of times before--\r\n\r\n\"East or west, home is best.  How do, Jane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nicely, thank'ee sir,\" returned Mrs. Pratt, with a bob, \"except for my\r\npoor feet.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls smiled.  They had heard the same question and answer ever\r\nsince they could remember, when Uncle Ben came home.  Tommy meanwhile\r\nhad removed his hat, Mary had slyly stuffed his red handkerchief into\r\nhis pocket, and now Elizabeth gently pushed him down into his favourite\r\narm-chair.  Mrs. Pratt, who suffered from bunions, and hobbled about,\r\nmade the tea, while Mary toasted what was in that country place still\r\ncalled a Sally Lunn, and Elizabeth fetched from the dairy, now very\r\nbare and forlorn, a pot of cool delicious Devonshire cream.  During\r\nthese preparations Tommy was content to sit at her uncle's feet,\r\nresting her head on his knees, and now and again giving his horny hand\r\na squeeze.\r\n\r\nIt was Tommy, however, who kept things lively at the tea-table.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Uncle,\" she would say, \"you must have more cream in your tea, or\r\nyou'll be as nervous as a cat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, my dear,\" was the meek reply.  \"Afloat I drink it without\r\nmilk or cream, sea-cows not being tractable animals, you know; but when\r\nin Rome, do as the rum 'uns do, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"That dreadful old pun of yours!  You expect us to punish you, don't\r\nyou now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be Punch to your Judy,\" returned the Captain, with a hearty\r\nlaugh, and for some minutes he alternately cracked his simple jokes and\r\ndevoted himself to his food.  \"I always say there's nothing in foreign\r\nparts to match the cakes and cream of Devonshire,\" he said, \"and you'd\r\nknow it if you lived on ship's biscuit and salt horse, my girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been this voyage, Uncle?\" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Peru and Monte Video, and other outlandish parts, my dear.  I was held\r\nup in the Doldrums, and water was running plaguy short; 'water, water\r\neverywhere, but not a drop to drink,' as that poetry fellow says.  One\r\nmore voyage, my girls, and then I drop anchor for good.\"\r\n\r\n\"We hoped you would stay with us,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't do it, Bess,\" he replied.  \"I can hold a straight course, but\r\nI couldn't run a straight furrow for the life of me.  No; one more\r\nvoyage, to the South Pacific Islands this time, and then I'll take a\r\nsnug little cottage somewhere by the sea, and spend my days\r\nwhitewashing it, and getting worse-tempered every day, and you shall\r\nkeep house for me, and smooth me down.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Tommy put the usual question--it always came from Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"What adventures did you have this time, Uncle?\"\r\n\r\nUncle Ben rubbed his chin, and assumed an air of deep reflection.\r\n\r\n\"Adventures!  Well, the only one worth speaking about,\" he said slowly,\r\n\"was when we were becalmed in latitude 35° South, longitude 152° East,\r\nI think it was.  By the chart we should have been about a hundred and\r\nfifty miles from the nearest land, but one morning Long Jimmy--the tall\r\nfellow with one eye, you remember----?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Tommy; \"he helped me down the side last time I saw you off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he was look-out at the time, and he sings out, 'Land-ho!'  I was\r\non deck in a twinkling, I can tell you; and there, a couple of points\r\non the starboard quarter, was a smallish kind of island, and stretching\r\naway behind it a lot of little islands pretty near as far as you could\r\nsee.  The biggest was as large as Mount St. Michael, maybe, and all of\r\na white shiny rock.  I made a few remarks about the chart-makers, and\r\nwas thinking of putting out a boat to examine it, when, bless your\r\neyes! that island began to move, and all the little 'uns after it.\"\r\n\r\nHere he drank half a cup of tea, and the girls waited breathlessly for\r\nhim to continue.\r\n\r\n\"Some one set up a cry of sea-serpent,\" he went on gravely, \"and Sunny\r\nPat--the little Irishman, you remember---?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, such a funny little man.  Go on, Uncle,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sunny Pat calls out, 'Begorra, shure 'tis the way of openin' it\r\nis!' and sure enough that big island showed a gash right across the\r\nmiddle, that grew wider and wider, and each side of it there was a row\r\nof teeth about as long as a church steeple.  Jupiter, 'twas a fearsome\r\nsight.  But Sandy Sam--you remember him, the big red-headed\r\nfellow--he's got more presence of mind than any able seaman I ever met.\r\nHe outs with a big gooseberry--we'd taken a few bushels on board at\r\nGreenland--and flings it straight at the monster, knowing that\r\nsea-serpents can't abide big gooseberries, being in the same line of\r\nbusiness, as you may say.  Well----\"\r\n\r\nHere the story was interrupted, for the girls made a simultaneous rush\r\non the old man.  Tommy pummelled him.  Mary put her hand over his\r\nmouth, and Elizabeth took his half-eaten cake, and declared that he\r\nshould have no more until he confessed that he had been fibbing.\r\n\r\n\"You naughty wicked old man,\" cried Tommy, as he shook with laughter.\r\n\"Now you shan't have another cup of tea until you've turned out your\r\npockets.\"\r\n\r\n\"I give in,\" said the Captain.  \"Three to one isn't fair play.  I've\r\nhad enough tea, only let me get my pipe alight and then we'll see.\"\r\n\r\nAs long as the girls could remember, their uncle, on his arrival, when\r\nhis first pipe was lit, had turned out his capacious pockets, in which\r\nthere was always a present of some kind for every one, besides oddments\r\nunaddressed which his nieces appropriated at their fancy.  Settled in\r\nthe arm-chair, with a big calabash pipe in his mouth, he plunged his\r\nhand into a pocket, and brought out the red bandana handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"That's your flag,\" cried Tommy.  \"Be quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience,\" he replied, producing a tin of tobacco and a knife.\r\n\r\n\"We'll let you keep them,\" said Mary.  \"What next, Uncle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, here's a small parcel with somebody's name on it, and it looks\r\nuncommon like Mary.\"\r\n\r\nMary seized the parcel, opened it, and uttered a cry of delight as she\r\nunfolded a pretty Indian scarf.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you dear!\" she cried, giving him a kiss.\r\n\r\nHe plunged his hand again into his pocket and drew out slowly and with\r\na solemn air that made the girls agog with expectation--a short cutty\r\npipe, at which they cried \"Shame!\"  Then came another small parcel,\r\nmarked with Elizabeth's name, which proved to contain a tortoiseshell\r\ncomb with silver mountings.  Another dip brought forth a bright round\r\nsilver case with a long cord hanging from a hole in the side.  Tommy\r\npounced on this.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Uncle?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's a contraption for getting a light in a wind, given me by an old\r\nfriend in Valparaiso,\" replied the Captain.  \"'Twas kindly meant, to be\r\nsure, but I've never used it, for I've never had any difficulty in\r\nlighting my pipe in any wind that ever blew short of a typhoon, and\r\nthen a man has other things to think about.  I'll show you how it's\r\ndone, and you can keep it against the time when you're an old woman and\r\ngo round selling things from a caravan: old women of that sort always\r\nsmoke.\"\r\n\r\n\"The idea!\" exclaimed Tommy, but when her uncle had shown her how to\r\nobtain a spark by turning a little handle sharply, and how the spark\r\nignited the cord, she took the thing and slipped it into her pocket.\r\n\r\nThen at last came the parcel for which Tommy had been eagerly waiting,\r\nand she gave a long sigh of pleasure as she drew through her fingers a\r\nscarf of exquisite fineness like Mary's.\r\n\r\n\"You're a darling!\" she cried, giving her uncle a tight hug, and at the\r\nsame time knocking his pipe from his mouth.  \"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" she\r\nsaid contritely.  \"Never mind, I'll fill it again for you.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Barton took from his pockets sundry other articles which he\r\ndivided among the girls, as well as a queer assortment of his personal\r\nbelongings.  When all his pockets were empty, Tommy said--\r\n\r\n\"Now you can put all that rubbish back; see what a litter it makes!\"\r\n\r\n\"For what you don't want, I return humble and hearty thanks,\" said the\r\nCaptain, using a form of words which they had heard from his lips ever\r\nsince they were babies.  \"And now if you can think of anything but\r\nfal-lals, we'll settle down and have a cosy talk about things.  Draw\r\nyour chairs up to the fire, girls.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLEAVING HOME\r\n\r\nUncle Ben listened attentively as Elizabeth gave an account of affairs\r\nat the farm.  He did not interrupt her, but now and then muttered an\r\nejaculation through a cloud of smoke.  Elizabeth was clear-headed, and\r\ndid not take long to explain the position to her uncle.  It was\r\nimpossible to keep on the farm without capital, and the Captain, though\r\nhe had a good sum laid by, was not the man to risk his money in a\r\nbusiness of which he knew nothing.  So the farm must be sold, and it\r\nwas clear that when everything was settled up, there would be little or\r\nnothing left for the girls to live on.  They mentioned the ideas they\r\nhad had of earning their living, and the obstacles in the way; and\r\nCaptain Barton puffed at his pipe, and pulled his beard, and every now\r\nand then stroked Tommy's hair as she leant against his knee.\r\n\r\n\"Hum!\" he grunted, when all had said their say.  \"There's only one way\r\nout of the difficulty that I can see.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused impressively, and the girls looked at him with expectation.\r\n\r\n\"And that is,\" he went on, weighing each word, \"to get you spliced.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spliced!\" cried Tommy.  \"Married, you mean?  Me married!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not you, perhaps--not yet a bit, seeing you are only a little\r\ntomboy sort of thing----\"\r\n\r\n\"Thing! how dare you!\" cried Tommy, pummelling her uncle's leg.\r\n\r\n\"I meant a thing of beauty, my dear,\" said he meekly, \"which, as the\r\npoet says, is a joy for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't think me a joy for long, I can tell you,\" returned Tommy.\r\n\"But, really, it's too ridiculous.  Bess, you don't want to get\r\nmarried?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for a living, certainly,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" added Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's squashed,\" cried Tommy, \"and if you can't think of\r\nanything better, Captain Barton--why, you're not married yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear, I've never tried,\" replied her uncle apologetically.\r\n\"Well, now, there's that notion I mentioned a while ago--a little\r\ncottage by the sea, you know; we four--me and the three Graces, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be simply awful, Uncle,\" cried Tommy.  \"Whatever should we do\r\nall day?  We should all become perfect cats, and you'd have a simply\r\nhorrid time.  No, if you want us to live with you, you must take a\r\nhouse somewhere where we could work--earn our salt, you know.  I'm not\r\ngoing to be a burden to anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a fine spirit, to be sure.  Then it must be London, I suppose,\r\nDeptford way or Rotherhithe; one of you could keep house for me, and\r\nthe others could go to classes, and learn teaching or whatever it is\r\nyou want to do.  What do you think of that, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should love to keep house for you, Uncle,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"And Mary and I would love to do the other thing, wouldn't we, Mary?\"\r\ncried Tommy.  \"So it's settled, and you'd better advertise for a house\r\nat once, Uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steady, my dear.  As I told you, I must make one more voyage.  I've a\r\nheap of things to settle up in various parts, and it'll be at least a\r\nyear before I'm ready.  The question is, what can you do for a year?\r\nYou can't remain here, and I'm not going to set you up in London\r\nwithout me to look after you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?  We'd look after each other,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't think of it, my dear,\" said the Captain decisively.  \"It's a\r\nfacer, that's the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what!\" cried Tommy, suddenly starting up.  \"Take us with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" gasped her uncle.\r\n\r\n\"I mean it.  Let's all go for a voyage.  I'd love to go round the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!  A parcel of girls in my windjammer with their frills and\r\nfurbelows--I never heard of such a thing!  Ridiculous!  Entirely out of\r\nthe question!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?  I don't see it,\" persisted Tommy.  \"Now, Captain Barton, don't\r\nbe a stick-in-the-mud, but give us reasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, it can't be done,\" said the Captain emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it can't, you haven't got any,\" said Tommy, wilfully\r\nmisunderstanding him.  \"Just like a man!\"\r\n\r\n\"We should really like it, Uncle,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"Can't be done, Bess,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"But why, Uncle?\" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Because--because--well, for one thing I don't carry a stewardess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you funny old man!  Bess could be stewardess.  Another reason,\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no cabin fit for young ladies.  It's a hard life on board,\r\nand----\"\r\n\r\n\"No reason at all,\" interrupted Tommy.  \"We must learn to rough it, now\r\nthat we've got to make our way in the world.  Besides, sea-air is good;\r\nit will establish our constitutions, as the doctors say.  Say yes,\r\nUncle, there's a dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, I'll sleep on it,\" said the Captain, temporizing.  He was\r\nreally much perplexed and troubled.  The suggestion was a preposterous\r\none, to his old-fashioned way of thinking; but he could not find\r\nreasons that would convince these very modern nieces of his, and he\r\nhoped that they would drop the wild notion before the morning.\r\n\r\nBut when the girls had gone to bed, and he sat alone, smoking his final\r\npipe, he had to confess to himself that Tommy's proposal was the\r\nsimplest solution of the difficulty.  It would not be an easy matter to\r\nfind comfortable quarters for the girls, but it was not impossible.\r\nTheir society would be very pleasant on board; he would love to have\r\nthem with him: in short, he decided to give way.  So the next morning,\r\nwhen they rushed at him as he entered the breakfast-room, with cries of\r\n\"Uncle dear, do take us,\" he replied, with a mild reluctance--\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, you might do worse.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Tommy kissed him and hugged him, calling him \"Dear old\r\nNunky,\" and went nearly wild with joy.\r\n\r\n\"But, mind you,\" he said warningly, \"you mustn't expect much in the way\r\nof comfort.  The _Elizabeth_ isn't the _Lusitania_, you know.  She's as\r\ntight a little craft as ever sailed the seas, but she wasn't built for\r\nfirst-class passengers.  You'll have to manage with a tiny cabin for\r\nall three.  And I give you fair notice: I keep strict discipline\r\naboard.  The slightest insubordination will be punished.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do you punish on board ship?\" asked Tommy mischievously.\r\n\r\n\"First, bread and water for a week.  For the second offence, you'll be\r\nlaid in irons in the hold, where you'll have no company but the rats,\r\nand they're uncommon hungry beasts, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How lovely!  Just like the prisoners in wicked barons' castles in the\r\nolden times,\" cried Tommy.  \"Oh, you dear silly old thing, did you\r\nthink you would frighten us?\"  And she gave him a hug that made him cry\r\nfor mercy.\r\n\r\n\"Now, girls, to business,\" he said, when order was restored.  \"This is\r\nWednesday.  I must run up to London to-morrow to see my lawyers, so\r\nthat if anything happens to me you won't be quite unprovided for.\r\nRemember, Bess, they're Wilkins and Short, of Bedford Row.  Not that\r\nthere isn't plenty of life in the old sea-dog yet, and I hope you won't\r\nhave to see them for many a day.  Now, as to clothes; no fal-lals, you\r\nknow; two serge dresses apiece, and one box for the lot of you.  I\r\ndon't suppose you bargained for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shouldn't think of bringing matinée hats,\" said Elizabeth, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Anything you want to keep, out of the things here, you must pack up.\r\nI dare say one of the neighbours will store it for you.  I'll arrange\r\nabout selling the rest.  I'll see your landlord to-day.  You will only\r\nhave about a fortnight to get ready, so you'd better begin at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go and see Mrs. Morris,\" said Mary.  \"She'll keep our things for\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't she be surprised!\" cried Tommy.  \"And what fun we shall have!\"\r\n\r\nThe girls found their neighbour, Mrs. Morris, in the midst of her\r\nweekly baking.  She declared afterwards that the surprise their news\r\ngave her nearly \"turned\" the bread.  She readily agreed to store their\r\nlittle stock of personal possessions, but shook her head at the idea of\r\ngirls wandering in heathen parts, as she put it.\r\n\r\nElizabeth asked her to accompany them to Plymouth and assist them in\r\nbuying their outfit.  This gave great delight to the kind motherly\r\nsoul.  She left her farm but seldom; a trip to Plymouth was a notable\r\nevent in her life; and when she returned with the girls, after a happy\r\nday's shopping, the spirit of adventure had so worked upon her that she\r\ncried, \"Well, now, I wish I was going too, that I do.\"\r\n\r\nImagine the bustle and excitement of the next few days!  Uncle Ben was\r\nin London.  In his absence the girls worked hard at their preparations.\r\nThey got a sewing-maid from the village, and all four worked early and\r\nlate cutting out and making two sets of blouses, one for ordinary use,\r\nand the other for any very hot weather they might encounter on the\r\nvoyage.  Even Tommy, not usually an industrious young person in such\r\nmatters, did her fair share, though it was a great trial of patience to\r\nhave to finish the overcasting of all the seams before Elizabeth would\r\nlay them aside ready for packing.\r\n\r\nEverything was complete before Uncle Ben's return.  The girls had\r\nfinished their outfit and packed it away neatly in their new cabin\r\ntrunk.  Their treasures were also packed ready to be handed into Mrs.\r\nMorris's keeping.  A few pieces of furniture which Elizabeth could not\r\nbear to part with had been warehoused at Plymouth.  The remainder,\r\ntogether with the farm stock, was to be sold after their departure.\r\nTommy was very woebegone at the idea of selling her pony, and when Joe\r\nMorris offered to keep him for her, and give him his food in exchange\r\nfor his services (that was his thoughtful and pleasant way of putting\r\nit), she hugged the burly farmer and called him a dear old man.\r\n\r\nAt last Uncle Ben returned.  The last arrangements were made, the last\r\nadieus said, and one fine day the little party of four drove to the\r\nstation to take train to Southampton, where the barque _Elizabeth_ was\r\nrefitting.  The girls waved their handkerchiefs gaily in response to\r\nthe parting salutations of the villagers; but they fell very silent\r\nwhen their old friends were out of sight, and the Captain, looking\r\nstraight before him, heard a sob or two on each side and behind.  Like\r\na wise man, he said nothing about the sadness of leaving the old home,\r\nbut related some of his recent experiences in London.\r\n\r\n\"I met a fine old friend of mine, a missionary,\" he said.  \"He is\r\nstationed on one of the South Sea Islands, and hasn't been home for\r\ntwenty years.  A real good sort is Henry Corke.  He has only been home\r\na month, and yet he is going out almost at once.  There's devotion for\r\nyou, girls.  I asked him if he'd like to come with us, offered him the\r\nattractions of refined female society----\"\r\n\r\n\"That was enough to choke him off,\" interrupted Tommy.  \"I hate to be\r\ncalled a female.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps it was a mistake not to say tomboy.  Anyhow, Corke was\r\nin too much of a hurry to come with us; prefers one of those dirty\r\nclanking steamers.  Mighty poor taste, I call it.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached the station the girls had thrown off their\r\ndespondency, and began to glow with excitement as they realized that\r\nthey were actually entering upon a new life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nABOARD THE \"ELIZABETH\"\r\n\r\n\"Here we are!\" cried Captain Barton, as the train ran into the dock\r\nstation at Southampton.  \"Now mind you don't get run over.\"\r\n\r\n\"The idea!\" said Tommy; \"we have been here before, Uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you have, my dear, but good advice is none the worse for being said\r\ntwice.\"\r\n\r\nThey made their way across the metals, on which locomotives were\r\nhauling and pushing heavy goods wagons, and came to the quay where the\r\n_Elizabeth_ lay taking in cargo.  She looked a mere dwarf beside a\r\nCastle Liner not far away; but she was bright with the glory of new\r\npaint, and Captain Barton gazed at her with an affectionate pride that\r\nhe would never have felt for a steamship.  They went on board.  Mr.\r\nPurvis, the Scots mate, gave the girls a shy greeting.  They smiled at\r\nthose of the crew whom they recognized, and a look of pained\r\nbewilderment settled on the face of one, Sandy Sam, when Tommy asked\r\nhim if he had any more big gooseberries.\r\n\r\n\"Never mention the word to him,\" said the Captain anxiously, as they\r\nwent below; \"he's very sensitive, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you're afraid your stories will be found out, you know you are,\"\r\nreplied Tommy.  \"Oh! what a sweet little cabin.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain had thrown open the door of the cabin which he had prepared\r\nfor his nieces, next to the saloon.  The girls looked in eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"How very nice!\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you like it, my dear,\" said the Captain.  \"I did my best, and\r\nPurvis was uncommon useful, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"A woman couldn't have managed better,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, bachelor men like me and Purvis get into the way of\r\nmaking up for what we lose.  We nearly forgot the looking-glass,\r\nthough, not having any particular features ourselves to be proud of.\"\r\n\r\nThe cabin was very daintily got up.  The woodwork was beautifully\r\npolished.  There were two bunks on one side, one above the other, and a\r\nthird on the opposite side, each with a spotless white bed-cover.  On\r\none wall hung a looking-glass; and a tiny wash-hand basin of polished\r\nzinc was fitted into a little alcove.  There were hooks for hanging\r\nclothes on the partition.  The clear space between the sides was only\r\ntwo or three feet across.\r\n\r\n\"Where shall we put our trunk?\" asked Elizabeth practically.\r\n\r\n\"In the saloon, my dear,\" replied her uncle.  \"We'll fasten it there,\r\nto prevent it rolling about if we meet any rough weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to get up one at a time,\" said Tommy, with a laugh.\r\n\"There isn't room for two to do up their hair at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know nothing about that,\" said the Captain, rubbing his bald\r\ncrown.  \"You mustn't quarrel or fight about who shall be first, or I'll\r\nhave to clap you in irons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you keep your irons?\" asked Tommy.  \"I'd like to see the\r\ndreadful things.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain looked so much embarrassed that Tommy divined the truth at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you haven't got any,\" she cried, dancing.  \"What a naughty old\r\nfibber you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, I pick my crew.  Them that aren't English are Scotch or\r\nIrish, and very respectable men.  But I dare say we can get a set of\r\nirons in the town.  Come along, we'll go and get something to eat;\r\nwe're too busy to cook on board.  I'll just drop in at one of the\r\nmarine stores and see if they've got a small size of irons for\r\nobstreperous females.\"\r\n\r\nAs they walked up the High Street Tommy suddenly cried--\r\n\r\n\"Look, Bess, isn't that little Dan Whiddon?  I wondered why he wasn't\r\nat the station to wish us good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed up the street, where she had seen a small oddly-dressed\r\nfigure pass under the narrow ancient arch that divides the street into\r\nAbove and Below Bar.  They hurried in that direction, but when they\r\nreached the spot the figure had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"I think you must have been mistaken,\" said Mary.  \"Dan wouldn't come\r\nso far from home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say.  Now, Uncle, where shall we go?  I'm famished.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain led them to the Crown Hotel.  He confessed that if he had\r\nbeen alone he would have gone to a humbler place near the docks, where\r\nhe might meet some shipmates.\r\n\r\n\"But you girls wouldn't like to eat among half-a-dozen sea-dogs smoking\r\nshag,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAs they ate their luncheon he said that he was disappointed with his\r\ncargo.  He had hoped to have a full ship for the South American ports,\r\nbut feared that after all he would have to go out light.  Tommy's\r\nassurance that his passengers would make up did not appear to convince\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThey slept on board that night, and were very merry at the novel\r\nexperience of undressing and dressing in such a narrow space.  Early\r\nnext morning the ship was towed out into the harbour.  She had hardly\r\nmade a cable's length, however, when the Captain received a message\r\nsemaphored from the quay to the effect that his agent had secured\r\nenough goods to complete his freight.  It would not be ready for\r\nshipment for two days.  He did not think it worth while to put back\r\ninto dock, as the extra cargo could be brought out in lighters.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two days the girls were much amused to see their uncle\r\nin his little dinghy, which held three at a squeeze, going to and fro\r\nbetween the ship and the shore, propelling himself by means of one oar\r\nfixed in a groove at the stern.  Nothing would satisfy them until he\r\nallowed one of the sailors, usually Sunny Pat, to take them in turn and\r\nteach them how to work the little tub in this manner.  Finding it very\r\neasy Tommy begged the Captain to let her take him ashore, and was\r\ndelighted when he told her on landing that she would make a skipper in\r\nno time.  She immediately bought a huge sailor's knife, much to his\r\namusement.  Her sisters, not to be outdone, in their turn rowed him\r\nashore, and each also bought a knife.\r\n\r\n\"You'd be terrible folk in a mutiny,\" said the Captain, laughing.  \"I\r\nreally must see about getting those irons.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the vessel's hold was filled from the lighters, and the cargo\r\nwas complete, there were no irons among the equipment.  The _Elizabeth_\r\nwas towed down Southampton Water; then, the wind being fair, the\r\ncourses were set, and she was soon sailing merrily down Channel.  The\r\ngirls were in the highest spirits.  It was a glorious day.  The sea\r\nglistened in the sunlight, and as the vessel passed through the Solent,\r\nwith the wooded shores of Hampshire on the right, and the Island on the\r\nleft, the Captain pointed out to his nieces various landmarks and\r\ninteresting spots, and gave them a first lesson in navigation.  In\r\nthree or four hours they passed the Needles.\r\n\r\n\"Now, girls,\" said the Captain, \"my advice is, keep fairly quiet for a\r\nlittle.  There's a bit of a swell, and--well, I say no more.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth and Mary remained reclining in their deck-chairs, quietly\r\nenjoying their novel experiences.  But Tommy was as nimble as Ariel on\r\nthe vessel of the Duke of Milan.  She was here, there and everywhere,\r\nasking why this and what the other; now exclaiming at a warship that\r\nglided silently past, now watching a graceful white-sailed yacht; at\r\none moment standing by the helmsman, then flashing along the deck to\r\nask her uncle for an explanation of something that had caught her\r\nattention.  The Captain watched her with kindly amusement.  He did not\r\nrepeat his warning.  \"The lass had better get it over,\" he thought.\r\nPresently his amusement became mixed with a little anxiety as he saw\r\nher growing quieter, and a tinge of green coming into her complexion.\r\nAt last with a sudden cry of \"Oh!\" she rushed to the companion and\r\ndisappeared.  The other girls followed her anxiously, and for a time\r\nthey were seen no more.  Thanks to the steadiness of the ship, and the\r\ncomparative smoothness of the sea, their sufferings were neither\r\nviolent nor prolonged; but it was a much-subdued Tommy who emerged an\r\nhour or two later and meekly put her hand into her uncle's.\r\n\r\nThe next moment she gave a gasp.  Not a yard away, lying on a pile of\r\ncanvas, huddled a little figure in brown corduroys and clumping boots.\r\nIt was Dan Whiddon, pale, grimy, with tear-stained eyes, fast asleep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"LYING ON A PILE OF CANVAS HUDDLED A LITTLE FIGURE.\"]\r\n\r\n\"There's a young Samson for you!\" said the Captain, noticing Tommy's\r\nlook of amazement.  \"A young rascal of a stowaway.  Long Jimmy heard a\r\ntapping in the forehold a while ago, and when the men opened up--a\r\nnuisance when all the cargo was nattily stowed--there was this young\r\nreprobate, half dead with hunger and fright.  You've a deal to answer\r\nfor, Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what have I done?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you and your sisters seem to have spoiled the young scamp.  When\r\nthey brought him up from below he whimpered out that the young ladies\r\nhad been kind to him, and he didn't like carrying luggage and cleaning\r\nrailway lamps, and when he heard that you were coming to sea he wanted\r\nhis mother to get me to take him as a cabin-boy.  She boxed his ears.\r\nBut he found out when you were leaving, and hid in a goods wagon that\r\nreached Southampton a little before we did, and watched his opportunity\r\nto slip on board when the barque was lying at the quay-side.  That's\r\nall I got out of him; and the motion served him as it serves most\r\nlandsmen, and he dropped asleep just where you see him there.  I'll\r\nhave something to say to him when he wakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor little fellow!\" said Tommy.  \"You won't be hard on him, Uncle?\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain grunted.  Perhaps he remembered that fifty years before he\r\nhad himself run away to sea.\r\n\r\n\"A rascally young stowaway,\" he muttered.  \"I can't put him ashore, as\r\nI shan't touch at any port this side of Buenos Ayres.  And his mother\r\ncrying her eyes out, I'll be bound.  And I'll have to spend several\r\nshillings on a cable to tell her he's safe.  A pretty thing for a man\r\nwith three nieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll pay for the cable, Uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! has she damaged the cable?\" asked Mary innocently, coming up at\r\nthis moment.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barton shook with laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you bookworms!\" he said, when he had command of his breath.  \"Take\r\na look at the cable, Mary, and see if you think Tommy, for all her\r\nmischievousness, could do it much damage.  No, 'tis another kind of\r\ncable we were speaking of--all along of young Samson there.  What would\r\nyou do with a stowaway, Bess?\" he asked of his eldest niece, who had\r\njust joined the others.\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you were right after all, Tommy.\r\nWhat a little sweep he looks!\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Dan stirred, opened his eyes, and when he saw the girls\r\nsmiled sheepishly.\r\n\r\n\"Now, young Samson, stand up and listen to me,\" said the Captain\r\nseverely.  \"Lay a hold of that stay there if you can't stand steady.\r\nYou come sneaking aboard this vessel, ruining my cargo, expecting to\r\nfill yourself with my victuals, and all for what?  Because you didn't\r\nlike cleaning lamps and carrying luggage.  What's that for a reason?\r\nThere's worse than that aboard ship, I can tell you.  If I did my duty,\r\nI should have you lashed to the mast and dosed with the cat.  And your\r\npoor mother crying her eyes out, and the police dragging the ponds, and\r\nthe Government sending detectives to all parts, and wiring to all the\r\nrecruiting sergeants, spending hundreds of pounds of the country's\r\nmoney all for a discontented young shaver not four feet high.  Now just\r\nyou run along to Mr. Purvis and ask him to forgive you.  He's very\r\nstrict is Mr. Purvis, much stricter than I am; and then ask Sandy Sam\r\nvery politely to fling a few buckets of water over you and scrub you\r\nwith holystone; and after that go to Cook and ask him if he can spare a\r\nbiscuit and a can of soup; and then I'll see if I can find some clothes\r\nthat will fit you, and we'll make a man of you, and an A.B. in time.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain's tone grew less stern and more genial as he went along,\r\nand when he had finished Dan smiled cheerfully, gave Tommy an extra\r\nsmile, and went aft to obey orders.\r\n\r\nThe run down Channel was very pleasant to the girls.  They showed the\r\nkeenest interest in the ship and the doings of the sailors.  These\r\nrough, good-tempered fellows were flattered by the attentions of their\r\npassengers, and never tired of answering their questions.  It was not\r\nlong before all three were able to tie all kinds of sailors' knots,\r\nsplice ropes, and do other simple things of the kind.  They knew the\r\nnames of the sails and the yards, and Tommy in particular never tired\r\nof airing her nautical vocabulary.\r\n\r\nEven the ship's cook became their willing slave.  Elizabeth took him in\r\nhand, and he meekly received her instructions, with great advantage to\r\nhis bill of fare.  Captain Barton declared that it was a good job he\r\nwas retiring, for this unwonted luxury was killing his seaman's\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nThe evenings were spent in the little deck cabin, where they played at\r\ndraughts with the Captain and mate, or listened to the yarns they spun.\r\nMary had brought her mandoline, and on fine evenings they would get up\r\na concert, the sailors singing their chanties and dancing the hornpipe.\r\nThe Captain hunted up some ancient grass hammocks, and when the weather\r\nwas quite calm the sailors rigged these up on deck for the girls.  Some\r\nof the crew taught them how to make hammocks, using string instead of\r\ngrass, and they often amused themselves by weaving string bags and\r\nbaskets.\r\n\r\nAs for Dan Whiddon, he soon became the pet of the ship.  He was a\r\ngood-tempered little fellow, willing to oblige anybody.  He was kept\r\nalways busy, and it was not long before he found that the life of a\r\nsailor was a good deal harder even than that of a porter at a wayside\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n\"But I likes it, I do,\" he said once to Tommy, \"better'n cleaning lamps\r\nand such.\"\r\n\r\n\"You get no tips, Dan,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"What's tips!\" he said.  \"I never had no good of 'em, miss.  Mother\r\ntook them all except a penny now and then for sweets, and the Captain\r\nhe gives me sweets for nothing, he do, and so I save, don't I, miss?\"\r\n\r\nThe weather held fair almost without interruption, and the girls became\r\nso well seasoned that an occasional gale did not distress them.  As\r\nthey approached the tropics the heat became rather trying, and then\r\nthey brought out of their trunk sundry light blouses at which their\r\nuncle cocked an eye.\r\n\r\n\"Rank disobedience!\" he said sternly.  \"I said serge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't they look nice, Uncle?\" said Tommy mischievously, \"and we made\r\nthem ourselves.  You can't object to that, my dear man, and we shall\r\nwash them ourselves, so there's no laundry bill for you to pay.  In\r\nfact, you haven't a leg to stand on, so you had better say at once they\r\nlook sweet and save time.  Don't you think so, Mr. Purvis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Weel,\" said the Scotsman cautiously, \"I wouldna say but what they are\r\nsuitable to the climate, but they're terrible gay like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you should see Bess's evening frock.  It's perfectly\r\nlovely--chiffon, with pink insertion; it suits her dark hair\r\nsplendidly.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, Tommy, that'll do,\" said the Captain; \"such talk isn't suitable\r\naboard this vessel.  You're unruly minxes, and what I'll do with you in\r\nLondon I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll soon get used to it, Uncle dear, and I really wouldn't worry if\r\nI were you.  We'll keep you straight.\"\r\n\r\n\"A happy girl, Purvis,\" said the Captain, when they were alone.\r\n\r\n\"Ou, ay, she is that.\"\r\n\r\nThey spent a couple of days in Buenos Ayres while Captain Barton was\r\nunloading part of his cargo and settling his affairs.  When they left,\r\na certain young electrical engineer asked to be allowed to call on them\r\nwhen he returned to England, and looked very crestfallen when Elizabeth\r\ntold him that they had no address.  They were almost disappointed when\r\nthey rounded the terrible Cape Horn without encountering a storm.\r\nAfter a short stay at Valparaiso, the Captain set his course direct for\r\nthe Pacific Islands.  Interested as the girls had been hitherto, they\r\nbecame intensely excited now.  Mary knew a great deal about Captain\r\nCook and other early navigators, and all the girls had read a volume of\r\nStevenson's on the South Seas, which their uncle had brought home once\r\nin a colonial edition.  The romance of this quarter of the globe had\r\ncaptured their imagination, and they looked eagerly forward to seeing\r\nthe strange men and women, the gorgeous scenery, the many novel things\r\nwhich their reading and their uncle's stories had led them to expect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA MIDNIGHT WRECK\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, I'm real glad I brought you girls with me,\" said Captain\r\nBarton, as they sat on deck one evening.  \"Many's the time I've felt a\r\nbit lonesome at night between sunset and turning in, but you do help to\r\npass the time away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pastimes, are we?\" said Tommy, with affected indignation.  \"Toys!\r\nDolls!  I won't be called a doll.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, my dear, you shan't,\" replied her uncle, slipping one arm\r\nround her waist, and the other round Mary's.  Elizabeth sat on her\r\ndeck-chair opposite them, knitting the second of a pair of socks.\r\n\"But, now,\" continued the Captain, \"you'd better be turning in.  'Tis\r\nlatish, and sleep, you know, 'it is a precious thing, beloved from pole\r\nto pole'; and if you don't get your full eight hours you'll be neither\r\nuseful nor ornamental, Miss Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Uncle!  It's such a lovely night,\" pleaded Tommy, leaning back on\r\nhis arm, and looking up into the brilliant sky--a sky such as is seen\r\nin the South Pacific, and nowhere else in the world.\r\n\r\nHere a heavy figure approached the group from forward.\r\n\r\n\"Glass is dropping fast, sir,\" said Mr. Purvis.\r\n\r\nElizabeth's needles ceased clicking.\r\n\r\n\"That means a storm, doesn't it, Uncle?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"A bit of a blow, maybe,\" said the Captain.  \"Now, girls, off with you.\r\nI'll just make things snug.  You go below, and sleep through it, and\r\nyou'll come up fresh as paint in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nTommy grumbled a little, declaring that a storm was impossible with\r\nsuch a clear sky and no wind; but she went below with her sisters, and\r\nsoon all three were fast asleep in their snug little cabin.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps two hours later when Elizabeth awoke suddenly.  There\r\nwere strange noises overhead, and the ship was rolling and pitching\r\nwith a violence new to her.  Every now and then she heard a hoarse\r\nshout, and a scurry of feet on deck.  The little appointments of the\r\ncabin rattled, and presently, as the vessel gave a particularly heavy\r\nlurch, the glass water-bottle slipped from its rack, and fell with a\r\ncrash to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" cried Tommy, sitting straight up in her bunk.\r\n\r\n\"The sea is rather rough,\" said Elizabeth quietly, \"and has sent the\r\nwater-bottle spinning.\"\r\n\r\n\"It woke me with a start,\" said Tommy.  \"My heart is thumping like\r\nanything.  Is there any danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not with Uncle on board,\" said Mary from the bunk below.  \"Let's go to\r\nsleep again.\"\r\n\r\nThey lay down, but to sleep was impossible.  Every moment the movements\r\nof the vessel became more violent, and they heard great booming noises\r\nas the waves broke over the deck.  The roar and shriek of the wind was\r\nmingled with the creaking of blocks and the shouts of men.\r\n\r\n\"I can't stand it any longer,\" said Tommy suddenly.  \"I'm going up to\r\nsee.  Come along, girls.\"  She sprang out of her bunk and had to clutch\r\nthe side to prevent herself from being thrown down.  The other girls\r\nfollowed her, and she laughed as they staggered and clasped each other.\r\n\r\n\"What fun!\" she said.  \"We haven't had a real storm before.  See who'll\r\nbe dressed first.  You two needn't do up your hair.\"\r\n\r\nDressing was a difficult matter; but, helping one another, they managed\r\nto get their things on at last and, holding hands, staggered out of the\r\ncabin to the companionway between it and the saloon.  Tommy was the\r\nfirst to climb the ladder, but when she came to the top she gave a cry\r\nof dismay.\r\n\r\n\"The hatch is on!\" she called.  \"Uncle has battened us down, mean old\r\nthing!\"\r\n\r\nShe beat on the hatch with her fist, and called shrilly for her uncle;\r\nbut the sounds were smothered by the greater noises above, and by and\r\nby she desisted, and tottered disconsolately down the steps.  \"Let's go\r\ninto the saloon,\" she said.  \"There's more room there than in the\r\ncabin.  You don't think there's any danger?\" she added, as the light of\r\nthe swinging lamp fell on Elizabeth's pale face.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know; I hope not,\" replied Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"It's a shame to batten us down,\" said Tommy indignantly.  \"I'd rather\r\nbe on deck and know the worst.\"\r\n\r\nThe three girls went into the saloon, and sat huddled together on a\r\nsofa, which was fixed firmly to the wall.  They found that only by\r\nkeeping a tight grip on the sofa, and each other, could they save\r\nthemselves from being dashed across the room.  Moment by moment the\r\nstorm increased in fury.  Now and again there was a tremendous shock,\r\nunder which the _Elizabeth_ quivered in every plank, and sometimes a\r\nsharp report as of woodwork wrenched away.\r\n\r\nThe girls were now thoroughly scared.  Pressed close together they\r\nshivered as they heard these ominous noises.  None of them spoke, but\r\nTommy gave a little gasp whenever a more than usually heavy sea struck\r\nthe vessel, and Mary gulped down a lump that would keep rising in her\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nHours passed.  Presently the movements of the vessel became less\r\nviolent, and at last Tommy gave a cry of delight as she heard the\r\nbattens being struck away from the hatch, and her uncle's voice as he\r\ndescended the ladder.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  There you are, my dears,\" he said cheerily, as he entered the\r\nsaloon.  \"I guessed these little tantrums would have wakened you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the storm over, Uncle?\" asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty near.  He's giving a last kick or two.  We're very tired and\r\nhungry on deck, and you girls can make us some coffee; I know you'd\r\nlike to make yourselves useful.  Cook can't be spared at this minute or\r\nI wouldn't ask you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we will,\" said Tommy, springing up.\r\n\r\n\"Is there much damage done, Uncle?\" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Damage!  Why, bless you, you can't fight without getting a bruise or\r\ntwo, even if you win.  The craft's had a bit of knocking about, I won't\r\ndeny, but what could you expect?  Now make the coffee, there's good\r\nlassies, and knock at the hatch when it's ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not going to batten us down again?\" cried Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, we don't want everything slopped about below, do we?\r\nThe coffee wouldn't be worth drinking if a sea washed into it just as\r\nyou were bringing it up.  Make it strong, mind, and plenty of sugar.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Barton left them.  He had not thought it necessary to say that\r\nthe cook, who couldn't be spared to make the coffee, was working hard\r\nat the pumps.  Nor that the vessel had lost its foremast, which in its\r\nfall had carried away the boats on the leeward side.  While the ship\r\nwas staggering under this blow a heavy sea had struck her and stove in\r\nthe boats on the weather side.  Nor did the Captain mention that the\r\nstorm had driven him many leagues out of his course, and that he was\r\ndesperately anxious lest he should have come within the region of the\r\ncoral reefs.  Until daybreak he had no means of ascertaining his\r\nwhereabouts, and he concealed from his nieces the anxiety with which he\r\nawaited the dawn.\r\n\r\nHe had paid his brief visit below merely to reassure the girls.  They\r\nat once set about making the coffee--no easy task, for though the wind\r\nhad abated there was still a heavy sea.  At last it was ready, and\r\nTommy mounted the companion-way, carrying a canful.  It was some time\r\nbefore her hammering on the hatch attracted attention, and when it was\r\nlifted the can was taken from her by her uncle, who said \"Thank'ee, my\r\nlass.  Now go down again and have some breakfast; it will be light in\r\nan hour or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we come up, Uncle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, my dear; we must tidy up first, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we help?\" persisted Tommy.\r\n\r\nBut there was no answer.  Captain Barton had clapped on the hatch.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little lassies!\" he said to himself.\r\n\r\nThe girls drank some coffee, and ate some biscuits, waiting impatiently\r\nfor their release.  It was no longer difficult to keep their seats; the\r\nhowling of the wind had ceased, and the noise above gradually\r\ndiminished, and the vessel steadied.  But now they were conscious of a\r\nsound that they had not heard before.  It was like the clanking of a\r\nsteam-engine.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what it is!\" cried Tommy, springing up.  \"Oh, I do so wish\r\nUncle would let us go up.  There's no danger now, surely.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Captain still remained above.  The clanking sound continued,\r\nand slight noises were heard occasionally.  The weather became still\r\ncalmer, and the girls, when they had finished their simple breakfast,\r\nbegan to doze.  Never since they left Southampton had their sleep been\r\nbroken, and they would have returned to their bunks had it not been so\r\nnear morning.  So they cuddled up together on the sofa, Elizabeth in\r\nthe middle and the other girls with their arms about her.\r\n\r\nAll at once there was a sudden jolt that set the tin cups flying from\r\nthe table, and made the girls spring up in alarm.  They were aware of a\r\nstrange, rasping, scraping sound.  Clutching one another, their\r\nstartled faces asked a mute question, to which, inexperienced as they\r\nwere, their instinct supplied a clear answer.  The ship had struck.\r\n\r\nThere were loud shouts from above, a renewal of the scurrying on deck,\r\nthen silence.  A minute or two after the girls heard the hatch removed,\r\nand their uncle hurried down.  Even in the dim light of the smoky oil\r\nlamp they saw how pale and haggard he looked.  They were too much\r\nfrightened to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Girls,\" he said quietly, \"put on your macintoshes and anything warm\r\nyou have, and come on deck at once.  Don't wait for anything else.\"\r\n\r\nHe was gone.  The very calmness of his tone, the absence of his wonted\r\njocularity, struck them with a chill feeling of dread.  Silently, with\r\npale faces, the girls fetched wraps and macintoshes from their cabin\r\nand hurriedly mounted the companion.  When they reached the wet and\r\nslippery deck a terrible spectacle lay before them in the light of the\r\ncrescent moon, shining fitfully out through the scudding clouds.  The\r\nforemast had snapped off at the height of a man.  The deck was strewn\r\nwith broken spars and a litter of torn sails and shattered rigging.  On\r\nthe lee side the davits were twisted and bent, and the boats had\r\ndisappeared.  On the weather side, the boats still swung on the ropes,\r\nbut were so battered that it was impossible to hope that they were\r\nseaworthy.  Three or four men were loosing the lashings that secured\r\nthe little dinghy, others were bringing up provisions from the cook's\r\ngalley.  The monotonous _clank, clank_ of the pumps told how the rest\r\nwere engaged.\r\n\r\nClose to the dinghy stood little Dan Whiddon, the cabin-boy, shivering\r\nwith cold and fear.\r\n\r\n\"Show a leg, now!\" cried the Captain to the men who were busy with the\r\ndinghy.  He turned to the girls, who stood near the companion, huddled\r\nin speechless terror.  \"You must get into the dinghy, my dears,\" he\r\nsaid gravely; \"we have struck a reef.  You can scull her, keep her\r\ngoing gently and look out for a passing ship.  Don't be alarmed.  The\r\nsea is smooth, you see.  We will make a raft and come after you as soon\r\nas we can.  My poor old ship is done for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! we can't leave you, Uncle,\" said Elizabeth, with quivering lips.\r\n\r\n\"No, we won't,\" cried Tommy, springing forward and clasping his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dears,\" replied the Captain with forced cheerfulness, \"you\r\npromised to obey orders, you know.  We can't save the ship.  Water is\r\npouring into her; the one chance is to get you safely afloat while we\r\nmake a raft.  You must go for my sake.  There must be land hereabouts;\r\nyou'll see it when the sun gets up, and I lay you won't be ashore an\r\nhour before we join you.  Come along now, all's ready.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain's firmness showed that further remonstrance was vain.  He\r\nled them to the side where the dinghy had been lowered.  Elizabeth was\r\nhelped into it, and as she turned away, after embracing her uncle, she\r\nheard the first mate say--\r\n\r\n\"D'ye think there's room for young Dan, sir?  He's no use to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain hesitated for a moment.  Three was a full complement for\r\nthe little boat, and even the boy's light extra weight might be a\r\nsource of danger.  Mary, as she kissed her uncle, heard the boatswain\r\ngrowl--\r\n\r\n\"You may as well drown the lot; the dinghy can't take more than three\r\nnohow.\"\r\n\r\nThen Tommy flung herself into her uncle's arms, and sobbed a good-bye.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my little lass,\" said he, \"bear up.  Brave's the word.  There's\r\nOne above will look after you.  Good-bye?  Nonsense!  I'll see you\r\nsoon, never fear.  Now, steady--there you go--now, where's that boy?\"\r\n\r\nBut Dan Whiddon, hearing the pessimistic boatswain's words, had slipped\r\naway in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe Captain called him, but he did not reappear.\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps it's as well,\" said the Captain.  \"Now, girls, don't\r\ntire yourselves out; lay by till daylight.  God bless you!\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth silently took the sculls, the other two crouched in the\r\nbottom of the boat, which drew slowly away from the ill-fated ship.\r\nAfter a little Tommy sprang up.\r\n\r\n\"Stop rowing, Bess,\" she cried.  \"It's no use going on in the dark.\r\nKeep close to the ship, so that we can see Uncle when he puts off on\r\nthe raft.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth rested on her oars.  There was reason in what Tommy had said.\r\nFor a time the girls could see the trembling masts of the ship in the\r\nmoonlight, and dark figures moving about the deck; but presently the\r\nmoon was obscured; some minutes passed before it again emerged from the\r\nclouds; and then, when the girls looked for the _Elizabeth_, there was\r\nnot a trace of her to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe two younger girls were now sitting up in the boat, facing their\r\nsister.  They looked with wild eyes into the darkness.  The same\r\nterrible thought oppressed them all: had the barque gone down already?\r\nHad there been time for the construction of a raft?  They dared not\r\nspeak, lest their spoken fears should overwhelm them.  Elizabeth\r\nsculled now in this direction, now in that, in the hope that it was\r\nmerely distance that had removed the ship from sight.  Now and again\r\nshe rested on her oars and listened; but there was no sound in the\r\nbreathless stillness, and she dipped her oars again; inaction was\r\nunbearable.  So the three miserable girls waited for the dawn.\r\n\r\nIt came at last with almost startling suddenness.  At one moment all\r\nthe sky was indigo with gleaming spots; the next, the myriad spangles\r\nhad disappeared, and the blue was covered with a curtain of grey.  But\r\ndaybreak did not bring with it the expected relief from suspense--a\r\nlight mist hung upon the surface of the sea--a tantalizing filmy screen\r\nwhich the eye could not penetrate.  The boat floated idly; again the\r\ngirls eagerly strained their ears for sounds of voices, or creaking\r\ntackle, or working oars; but they heard nothing except the slow\r\nrippling of the sea against the side of the dinghy.\r\n\r\n\"Pull, Bess,\" cried Tommy frantically.  \"We can't have come far.  Row\r\nabout; we must find the ship.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth, though hope was dead within her, rowed this way and that,\r\nbut everywhere was the encircling mist; there was no sign of vessel,\r\nraft or land.\r\n\r\n\"We had better wait until the sun is up,\" she said at last.  \"It will\r\nscatter the mist, and then we can at least see our way.\"\r\n\r\nThe air was growing warmer, with a damp clammy heat; but the girls\r\nshivered as they sat silent in the gently rocking boat.  The grey mist\r\nturned to a golden dust, and presently the sun burst through, putting\r\nthe thinning vapour to flight.  Now the girls eagerly scanned the\r\nhorizon as it widened, but neither hull nor sail stood out of the\r\nimmense tract of blue.  Tommy rose in the boat, to see if she could\r\nthen descry any dark patch upon the surface which might be a raft; but\r\nthere was nothing.  Her lips quivered as the meaning of this vast\r\nblankness forced itself upon her mind.  For a few moments she stood\r\nwith her back to her sisters; then turning suddenly, she said, with a\r\nlaugh that was not very different from a sob--\r\n\r\n\"'There were three sailors of Bristol City.'  I say, how should I do\r\nfor the part of Little Billee?\"\r\n\r\nThis sudden touch of comedy relieved the tension, as Tommy intended.\r\nThe other girls smiled feebly, and Tommy, saying to herself, \"I must\r\ntalk, talk, or we shall all go mad,\" went on--\r\n\r\n\"Could I have a swim, do you think?\"  She flung off her macintosh.\r\n\"It's getting hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you mustn't think of it,\" said Mary; \"these waters are full of\r\nsharks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, let's have another breakfast.  What have they given us?\"\r\n\r\nWhile Elizabeth was examining the provisions placed in the boat Tommy\r\nleant over the side and dashed handfuls of water over her face.\r\n\r\n\"There!  Now I feel better,\" she said.  \"What is there, Bess?\"\r\n\r\nThere were tins of biscuits, sardines, and condensed milk, a bottle of\r\ncoffee extract, three tin cups, a spirit lamp, a small tin kettle, a\r\ntea-caddy half full, a small box of sugar, a large plum cake, some\r\nboiled bacon, and two gallon jars containing water.\r\n\r\n\"I am not hungry at present,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"Neither am I, but one must do something,\" said Tommy; \"a cup of water\r\nand a slice of cake for me.\"\r\n\r\nThey all took a draught of water, but only Tommy made any pretence of\r\neating.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Bess,\" said Tommy as she gulped down her crumbs of cake, \"we'll\r\ntake turns to row.  Uncle----\"  Her voice broke; she cleared her throat\r\nand continued--\"Uncle said there must be land somewhere near, and he'll\r\nthink us awful slackers if he gets there first.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't tell which way to go,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we can't, but we must choose a direction and stick to it, or\r\nwe shall go round in a circle like a dog chasing its tail.\r\n\r\n  'O' a' the airts the wind can blaw\r\n  I dearly lo'e the West.'\r\n\r\nLet's make for the west, and take our chance.\"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was adopted.  Elizabeth admired her small sister's\r\npluck in being so determinedly cheerful.  They turned their faces to\r\nthe sun, and for some time rowed steadily westward, each girl taking a\r\nspell at the oars.  But as the day grew older the heat became\r\nintolerable and exertion painful, so they decided to rest until the\r\nevening.  None of them any longer expected to see the raft, though none\r\nconfessed it; all they hoped for was to find land.  They were very much\r\ncramped in the little boat, but none grumbled about the discomforts.\r\nBy and by it occurred to Elizabeth to rig up their macintoshes as a\r\nsort of awning, supporting it on the oars and the boat-hook, and this\r\nsheltered them from the worst effects of the sun.  They made another\r\nspare meal in the afternoon, and when the sun was between south and\r\nwest they resumed their rowing.  So far there had not been a sign of\r\nland; but Uncle Ben had certainly said that the ship had struck on a\r\nreef, and where there were reefs dry land could hardly be far away.\r\nThis hope buoyed them up through the hot day.\r\n\r\nThe sun went down below the horizon with the suddenness general in the\r\nSouthern Ocean.  Once more darkness was upon them.  With the return of\r\nnight came a sense of forlornness and desolation of spirit.  They fell\r\nsilent, each brooding on the sad fate which had overtaken their uncle\r\nand them.  The night was cold; enveloped in their wraps and macintoshes\r\nthey huddled together for warmth, letting the boat drift at the mercy\r\nof the sea.  Their broken sleep on the previous night, and their\r\nexertions and anxieties during the day, had told upon them, and after\r\nsome hours the two younger girls fell asleep.  Elizabeth dared not\r\nsurrender herself to slumber.  Who could tell what might happen?  As\r\nthe eldest, she felt a motherly responsibility for the others, though\r\nshe had to confess to herself how utterly helpless she was if danger\r\ncame.  She sat with her elbows on her knees, thinking, brooding.\r\nEverything had happened so suddenly that she was only just beginning to\r\nrealize the immensity of the disaster.  A cockle-shell of a boat, that\r\nwould capsize if the sea were the least bit rough; the wide ocean all\r\naround; three girls, healthy enough, but not inured to hardship; the\r\npossibility of drifting for days or weeks, never touching land or\r\ncoming within the track of a ship; food dwindling day by day; the\r\nhorrors of thirst: these dreadful images flashed in turn upon\r\nElizabeth's mental vision and made her shudder.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't we stay with Uncle?\" she thought; and then the remembrance\r\nof the dear old man, and their happy days on board, and her conviction\r\nthat the vessel had gone down before the raft could be made, smote\r\nElizabeth's heart with grief, and for the first time the tears rolled\r\ndown her cheeks, unchecked.\r\n\r\nShe wept till her head ached, and she felt dazed.  At last, utterly\r\nworn out, she dozed into an uneasy and fitful sleep, still supporting\r\nher head on her hands.  She woke every few minutes, blamed herself for\r\nnot keeping a better watch, then slumbered again.  She was startled\r\ninto wakefulness by the rays of the early morning sun.  Lifting herself\r\nstiffly, and carefully, so as not to disturb the two girls at her feet,\r\nshe looked around, and was alarmed as she caught sight of a ring of\r\nwhite within a few hundred yards of the starboard side of the boat.  At\r\nthe first glance she recognized the foam of breakers dashing over a\r\nreef.\r\n\r\n\"Girls!\" she cried, \"wake up!  Quick!\"  She released herself from them,\r\nseized the sculls, and pulled energetically away from the threatened\r\ndanger.  Tommy threw off her macintosh and stood up in the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Land!\" she cried.  \"Look, Mary, beyond the breakers there.  Woods!\r\nOh!  I could scream for joy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look out for a landing-place,\" said Elizabeth, as she rowed slowly\r\nparallel with the reef.\r\n\r\n\"What if there are savages?\" murmured Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we'll soothe their savage breasts,\" cried Tommy confidently.  \"I\r\ndon't care if there are so long as my feet are on dry land again.  Can\r\nyou see the raft?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of a raft; nothing was in sight but the foam-swept\r\nreef, the cliffs, and the dark background of woods behind.\r\n\r\nA pull of half-a-mile brought the dinghy clear of the breakers, and the\r\ngirls saw the sea dashing up the face of the high weather-worn cliffs.\r\nThere appeared to be no beach, no possible landing-place.  Mary, the\r\nbookworm of the family, began to fear that the land was only one of\r\nthose precipitous crags of which she had read, inaccessible from the\r\nsea.  But in a few minutes they discerned to their joy a gap in the\r\ncliffs, and a sandy cove that promised an easy landing-place.\r\n\r\nTo this Elizabeth turned the dinghy's head.  A shark glided by as they\r\nneared the shore, but was almost unnoticed in their excitement.  Tommy\r\ngave a cheer as the boat grated on the sand.  In a moment she was out;\r\nher sisters followed more deliberately; then the three together,\r\nexerting all their strength, dragged the boat toilsomely up the beach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE THREE TOGETHER DRAGGED THE BOAT UP THE BEACH.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND BEAUTIFUL\r\n\r\nHot and panting from their exertions, the girls threw themselves down\r\non the sand, and for a time remembered nothing but their escape from\r\nwhat had seemed certain death.  But presently Tommy sprang up, and,\r\nshading her eyes against the sun's fierce glare, looked long and\r\nanxiously seaward.  An irregular white line marked the reef, but beyond\r\nthat the ocean stretched out into the distance, without a spot upon its\r\nglistening surface.  Her sisters joined her, and, with their arms\r\nclasped about each other, they searched the horizon for the raft and\r\nUncle Ben.  None of them spoke: each was afraid to utter her foreboding\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nThen they turned and gazed at the green woodland that rose almost from\r\nthe brink of the sea.  It was a perfect day, and the land to which they\r\nhad come might well be a paradise of the South Seas such as they had\r\nread about.  But they were too anxious to be aware of its beauties.\r\nMary caught Elizabeth by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Are there people?\" she said in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Savages, perhaps cannibals?\" said Tommy, with a shiver.\r\n\r\nThey stood holding each other, afraid to stir.  Elizabeth for a moment\r\nhad a wild notion of dragging the boat down again, and putting to sea\r\nin the hope of meeting Uncle Ben; dread of the unknown had possession\r\nof her.  But she recognized that so to act would be foolish, and\r\ncrushing down her fears, she said quietly--\r\n\r\n\"I think we had better look about a little; perhaps Uncle has already\r\nlanded.\"\r\n\r\nHope springs up easily in young minds.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Tommy valiantly.  \"Who's afraid!  I--no, you go\r\nfirst, Bess, as you're the biggest.  I know; you take an oar, and Mary\r\nanother, and I'll take the boat-hook.\"\r\n\r\nThus armed, after making the boat secure, they took their way up the\r\nstrand, through a gap in the wooded cliffs that seemed to have been\r\ncarved out in some past time by a stream.  They walked slowly and\r\ntimidly, as if half expecting to find a savage lurking behind every\r\nbush or tree.  But as they went on, and found no wild islanders to\r\nmolest them, they began to be more aware of the beauty of their\r\nsurroundings.  On either hand there was a riot of splendid vegetation.\r\nStrange plants and trees, some bearing brilliant flowers, others\r\ntempting fruits, grew in magnificent profusion, and birds gorgeous in\r\ncolour flitted from tree to tree.\r\n\r\nHere were feathery palms, there a cluster of small trees like hazels;\r\nall about, the ground was carpeted with masses of convolvulus and\r\ncreeping plants innumerable, and the air was heavy with mingled scents.\r\n\r\n\"What a lovely place!\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Not to us,\" said Tommy.  \"We might as well be in a desert.  Oh, what's\r\nthat?  I saw something move.\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the right hand, and for a moment the girls held their\r\nbreath.  Then they laughed, but very nervously; the something was\r\nnothing but a little animal, of what kind they knew not, that scuttled\r\naway into the woodland.\r\n\r\nThey went on again, becoming less timid the farther they advanced, for\r\nthere was no sight or sound to alarm them.  They began to talk more\r\nfreely, but always in low tones.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it _is_ an island,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"It must be,\" replied Mary.  \"There is no other land until you get to\r\nAustralia, and that's thousands of miles away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what shall we do if we don't find Uncle?\"\r\n\r\nThe question recalled to them all that had happened, and again they\r\nfelt the bitterness of misery and despair.\r\n\r\n\"We must keep up our spirits,\" said Elizabeth, trying to speak\r\ncheerfully.  \"At any rate we shan't starve if these fruits are good to\r\neat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see any breadfruit,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it looks as if we are to be Crusoes,\" said Tommy, \"only Crusoe\r\nwas alone.  Goodness!  I couldn't bear to be alone.  I should go mad.\r\nDo you think Uncle will find us, Bess?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope and trust he will, dear.  We are safe; why shouldn't he be?\r\nDon't let's look on the black side of things.  Shall we go back to the\r\nboat and eat some of the food we brought?  It won't keep like the\r\nfruits.  Then we had better rest; I'm sure you are worn out; we can\r\nlook round again presently, when the sun isn't so hot.\"\r\n\r\nThey returned to the boat, and made a meal of some biscuit and cold\r\nbacon, carving the bacon somewhat clumsily with their jackknives,\r\nremembering how their uncle had laughed at them for buying such manlike\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\n\"I'm terribly thirsty,\" said Tommy.  \"I wonder if the water in the\r\nstream there is good to drink!\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed to a brook that meandered down to the shore from amid the\r\nwoodland above, purling musically, and flashing like silver in the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\n\"There's not much fear of that,\" said Mary.  \"I'll get some while you\r\ncut me another slice of bacon.\"\r\n\r\nThe water was delightfully fresh and cool, proving that there was a\r\nspring somewhere in the interior.\r\n\r\nHaving made a heartier meal than any of them expected to make, they lay\r\ndown under the shade of a large tree, and talked until they fell asleep\r\nfrom sheer fatigue.  The air was much cooler when they awoke.  At\r\nMary's suggestion they climbed to the highest point of the cliffs, from\r\nwhich they could command a wide prospect over the sea.  When they\r\nreached the summit, they scanned the surface, now as smooth as a lake,\r\nfor signs of boat or raft; but nothing was in sight, except far away\r\nseveral dusky spots which Mary at once declared must be other islands.\r\n\r\n\"Very likely we drifted past them in the night,\" said Elizabeth.  \"Look\r\nat that mass of floating seaweed just beyond the reef; you see there is\r\nquite a strong current.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we went as fast as that in the dinghy, we must have come miles from\r\nwhere the wreck happened,\" said Tommy.  \"And Uncle won't know; he'll\r\nnever find us.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the shadow of their misfortune once more descended on them, and\r\nthey turned away from each other to hide their distress.  Then Tommy\r\nswung round and cried--\r\n\r\n\"I won't be a baby!  Bess, if you see any sign of waterworks again,\r\nsmack me.  What's the good of crying?  Let's go exploring; that'll help\r\nto keep off the blues.\"\r\n\r\nBut in spite of their brave attempts, they veered between hopefulness\r\nand despondency all the rest of the day.  They roamed here and there,\r\nnot really going very far, for they still felt safer within easy\r\ndistance of their boat.  More than once they returned to the cliff to\r\nsearch the horizon longingly for any sign of ship or boat, but always\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their wandering they came upon some trees bearing\r\nfruit about which they had no doubt.\r\n\r\n\"Bananas!\" cried Tommy, with excitement.  \"How jolly! and look at the\r\nclusters on the ground.  We've only to pick them up.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral clusters had fallen from the trees, and lay ripening where they\r\nfell.  The girls ate some of the fruit, taking note of the position of\r\nthe trees, so that they might come to them again.\r\n\r\nThen they strolled on, keeping close to the shore, and stopping every\r\nfew minutes to gaze yearningly over the sea for the raft they longed to\r\nbehold.  Turning their backs on this disappointing horizon, they let\r\ntheir eyes range over the island, their minds confused between\r\nadmiration and wondering awe.  The ground rose in a succession of\r\nirregular terraces, covered with vegetation in every imaginable shade\r\nof green.  In the distance the prospect terminated in a ridge, above\r\nwhich hovered a light mass of opalescent cloud.  What forms of life\r\nwere stirring amid that dark woodland?  What lay beyond that curtain of\r\nrose pink and pearl?  The girls were awed by the mystery of things, as\r\nif subject to an enchanter's spell.\r\n\r\n\"What's the time?\" asked Tommy, presently, bringing them back to the\r\ncommonplace.  Both Mary and Elizabeth had watches pinned upon their\r\ndresses, but on looking at them they found that each told a different\r\nhour, and both had stopped.\r\n\r\n\"I forgot to wind mine up,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"So did I,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"It must be getting late,\" said Tommy.  \"Look at the sun.\"\r\n\r\nIt was clear from its position that night was at hand.  And then Tommy\r\nasked a question that brought back all their uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we to sleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have thought of that all day,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"Then it's clear you are the statesman of the family,\" said Tommy.  \"I\r\ncouldn't have thought about it all day without telling you, and you\r\nhaven't said a word.  It didn't occur to me until a moment ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no wild beasts in the South Sea Islands--at least, I've\r\nnever heard of any,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"That's one comfort,\" said Tommy, \"and we've seen no savages or\r\nanything else to alarm us.  Now if we were boys--scouts or something,\r\nused to campaigning in the open--we shouldn't care a pin, but I feel\r\ndreadfully shaky.  What are we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must face it,\" said Elizabeth quietly.  \"I think myself we had\r\nbetter stay in the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"How awful! think of last night,\" said Tommy dolefully.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps there would be a storm and we should be upset, or blown out to\r\nsea,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I didn't mean to launch the boat,\" said Elizabeth.  \"That would be\r\ntoo risky.  We'll leave it on the beach.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only a bit better than being in the open,\" said Mary.  \"I know,\r\nwhy not make a fire to scare off intruders?  I've read about that being\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's quite brilliant,\" said Tommy.  \"And it will be a beacon too;\r\nperhaps Uncle will see it.  Let's go back at once and get ready for\r\nsupper and bed.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth was glad of any activity that would keep them from thinking\r\nof their troubles.  They returned to the beach.  First they collected a\r\nnumber of stones, which they piled up to make a rough fire-place.  Then\r\nthey gathered a large quantity of twigs and dry grass from the edge of\r\nthe forest, and finding several small trees which had been uprooted by\r\nstorms, they lugged these down to their fire-place.  Then the\r\nself-lighter which Tommy had received from her uncle came in handy, and\r\nby the time it was dark they had a bright pleasant fire that was very\r\ncheering.\r\n\r\nThey ate more of their biscuit and bacon, with plum cake for sweets and\r\nbananas as dessert; then, having heaped some fuel on the fire, they\r\ncrept into the boat and arranged themselves as comfortably as possible.\r\n\r\nTommy was soon asleep, but the elder girls lay awake for a long time,\r\nclasping each other, and talking in murmurs so as not to disturb their\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n\"Mary dear,\" said Elizabeth, \"we must look at the worst side and face\r\nit for Tommy's sake, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know.  She's not really very strong, is she?  Though she has\r\nsuch spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she'll be all right so long as she doesn't get wretched, so we\r\nwon't say a word to depress her.  We ought to be thankful that we are\r\nsafe so far.  I'm afraid to think of what has happened to Uncle; but\r\nsupposing--supposing he is--lost, we shall have to do as well as we can\r\nuntil we are seen from a passing ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we never are!\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't suppose that.  Think of the many castaways who have been\r\npicked up in time.  By the look of it we shall find food here, and I\r\nrather fancy the island must be uninhabited, or we should have seen\r\nsome signs of people.\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't been all over it yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course we can't be sure.  If we do come across people we must\r\ntry and make friends with them.  Aren't there some islands called the\r\nFriendly Islands because the people were quite decent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  Some of the islanders in these parts are gentle and peaceable.\r\nBut I'm dreadfully afraid of savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I, but we won't think of them.  What a lovely night it is!  So\r\nstill and peaceful! and we're just three insignificant dots in all this\r\ngreat beautiful universe.\"\r\n\r\nThey mused in silence, and by and by fell asleep.  Dawn found them very\r\ncramped and stiff.  The fire was out, and as they shivered in the cool\r\nmorning air they felt something of the previous day's despondency.  But\r\nElizabeth, with determined cheerfulness, called to her sisters that it\r\nwas breakfast-time.  They made themselves some coffee, using the\r\nextract sparingly to eke it out as long as possible, and after bathing\r\ntheir faces in the water at the brook, ate their simple breakfast and\r\nthen made their way to the top of the cliff to search the ocean once\r\nmore for a sign of help.\r\n\r\nThe sea was even calmer than it had been yesterday, and as the mist\r\nrolled off its surface they were able to scan countless miles of space.\r\n\r\nThere were the same dark distant shapes, purple in the early sunlight,\r\nand they felt a wondering curiosity about them; but there was no sail\r\nor funnel that betokened a ship.  First one and then another discovered\r\na speck on the skyline, and they debated whether it was or was not a\r\nboat; but after gazing until their eyes were tired they came to the\r\nconclusion that there was no immediate hope of rescue.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to raise a flag of distress,\" said Mary, \"which might be seen\r\nif a ship comes near; but we haven't anything big enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, we have!\" said Tommy.  \"If we tie our silk scarves together\r\nthey will make a fine flag.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we haven't a flagstaff,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"There's a lovely one,\" said Mary, pointing to a tall slender tree that\r\nstood a little apart from the nearest clump of woodland, like a\r\nsentinel thrown out seaward.  \"Can you climb that, Tommy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather!  Father didn't like my climbing, but if I hadn't where should\r\nwe be now?\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth knotted the three scarves together.  Then Tommy ran to the\r\ntree and climbed nimbly almost to the top, the others watching her\r\nbreathlessly.  Soon the flag of red and white was fluttering in the\r\nlight morning breeze.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be torn to shreds by the first storm,\" said Tommy when she\r\ndescended.  \"Let's hope it will be seen before a storm comes.\"\r\n\r\nThey spent the day much as they had spent the first one on the island;\r\nsitting on the beach, now and again visiting the cliff to take another\r\nlook across the sea, gathering bananas from the little plantation and\r\nwandering for a short distance along the shore.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do when all the bananas are gone?\" asked Tommy, as they\r\nate their dinner.  \"The food we have in the boat won't last a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to go exploring,\" said Mary.  \"I can't believe that\r\nthese bananas are the only eatable fruits, and no doubt there are more\r\nbananas somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked up once more at the distant mysterious ridge.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how you feel,\" said Tommy, \"but I'm rather scared of\r\ngoing far from the beach.  Who knows what we should find among those\r\ntrees?\"\r\n\r\n\"We might go a little farther than we did yesterday,\" suggested\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, then,\" said Tommy.  \"Oh, gracious!  What's that?\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed towards the ridge.  The other girls looked, but saw nothing.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\"I saw a large beast cross over that bare spot,\" replied Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"I think you must have fancied it,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Rubbish!  I tell you I saw it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there aren't any large beasts in these islands,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?  You think you know everything,\" said Tommy sharply,\r\n\"just because you've read a few books.  I tell you I _did_ see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It couldn't have been a large animal, all the same,\" persisted Mary.\r\n\r\n\"You're an idiot,\" cried Tommy.\r\n\r\nElizabeth saw it was time to intervene.  The girls' nerves were a\r\nlittle on edge.\r\n\r\n\"I dare say you are both right,\" she said tranquilly.  \"Tommy evidently\r\nsaw something, and though there are no large native animals, Mary,\r\nperhaps it's an imported one.  We can't tell but that there are people\r\nover there, and they might have anything, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they might,\" said Tommy triumphantly.  \"It might be an\r\nelephant or anything.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the little storm blew over, but it made Elizabeth very\r\nthoughtful.  As she lay awake that night, she resolved that something\r\nmust be done to occupy their thoughts.  \"It will never do to idle away\r\nour time, as we've been doing,\" she said to herself, \"or there'll be\r\nconstant bickerings, and we shall all get slack and mopish.  Oh, dear!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she did not sleep before she had made a plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA LOCAL HABITATION\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dears,\" said Elizabeth as they sat at breakfast next morning,\r\n\"I've got an idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurray!\" cried Tommy.  \"What is it, Bess?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just this.  We must act as if we were going to stay on this\r\nisland for ever.\"\r\n\r\nTommy gasped, and a look of dismay came into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think we'll be rescued, then?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't give up hope.  We may be seen from a ship any day, or\r\nUncle may come for us; but we can't depend on it.  Plenty of men and\r\nboys have been shipwrecked like us on a lonely island, and have managed\r\nto shift for themselves.  Why shouldn't we?  We're used to outdoor\r\nwork: at least, _I_ am, and it would be an odd thing if we couldn't\r\nmanage to make ourselves comfortable on an island like this, with half\r\nour work already done for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Why, if you're right about there being plenty of fruit--and I don't\r\nsee why you shouldn't be--we shan't have to grow our food, and that's\r\nthe chief thing.  So we shall have more time for other things.  The\r\nfirst thing is to see just what we've got.  Here's mine.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned out her pocket, and displayed two handkerchiefs, a thimble,\r\na small whistle and her jack-knife.\r\n\r\n\"That's not a great deal,\" she said, smiling.  \"Now, Mary.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's my knife, and a hanky, and my little pen-knife, and hurray! my\r\nhousewife.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as she suddenly remembered that on the night before the storm she\r\nhad been mending her uncle's clothes, the recollection almost moved her\r\nto tears.\r\n\r\n\"I've got the most,\" said Tommy, with a laugh.  \"Look here--scissors,\r\nhanky, some bits of string, my match-box, jack-knife, picture postcard\r\nof an aeroplane--wish we had an aeroplane!--and----\"\r\n\r\nShe had unfolded a much-worn scrap of paper; now she folded it again\r\nand replaced it in her pocket.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"It's only that stupid old receipt for butterscotch: no good to us\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nThey all smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we can't boast of much in the way of personal possessions,\" said\r\nElizabeth; \"but we have the boat, two oars, a boat-hook, the painter, a\r\nfew cups and things, my string bag, that's a lucky find--and our\r\nmacintoshes.  More than Crusoe had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so much, Bess,\" said Mary.  \"You don't remember.  I always think\r\nCrusoe was jolly lucky.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say you are right.  Well, we've taken stock.  That's one good\r\nthing done.  Now what do you say to building a hut?\"\r\n\r\n\"What!  With scissors and knives?\" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see.  We ought to try, I think.  The weather is lovely now, but\r\nI shouldn't care about sleeping in the boat in a rainstorm, even under\r\na macintosh.  And you know how it rains in these tropical parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll be great fun,\" said Tommy, \"but I don't see how it's to be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to cut down some saplings with our jack-knives.  I don't\r\nquite see myself what we shall do next, but that will be a start,\r\nanyway, and I dare say ideas will come as we go along.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't sound much like an architect,\" said Tommy, \"but let's\r\ntry.  It will give us something to do and keep us from getting catty.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth smiled as she saw her intentions thus realized.\r\n\r\n\"We must choose our site,\" she said.  \"Surveying, don't they call it?\"\r\n\r\n\"All settlements are made near running water,\" said Mary, \"so it ought\r\nto be near the stream.\"\r\n\r\nThey followed with their eyes the course of the bright little stream as\r\nit flowed out of the woodland down to the shore.  There was no suitable\r\nspot for the hut near at hand, and to find one involved going farther\r\nthan they had yet ventured to go.  But having now a definite object in\r\nview they found themselves a little more courageous, and springing up\r\nthey set off along the bank of the stream towards the higher ground.\r\nThey walked cautiously and in silence, looking about them with\r\nwide-open eyes, ready to flee at the slightest alarming sight or sound.\r\nSuddenly Tommy said in a whisper--\r\n\r\n\"Here! this is the very place.\"\r\n\r\nShe indicated a grassy knoll some ten or twelve feet above the bed of\r\nthe stream.  The girls stopped at its edge and looked at it.  On the\r\ninland side it was fringed with a row of small trees; seaward the view\r\nwas uninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\"It looks nice,\" said Mary.  \"Let's measure it.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth, being the tallest, stepped the grassy plot from end to end\r\nand from side to side.\r\n\r\n\"I make it about twenty feet by sixteen,\" she said, \"just about the\r\nsize of our dining-room at home.  I think it will do splendidly.\r\nThere's water close at hand; there are plenty of saplings in the woods\r\nbeyond; and the hillside will protect us from storms, unless they come\r\nfrom the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what a lovely outlook it has!\" said Mary, turning towards the sea.\r\n\"We couldn't have a nicer place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will fix on it,\" said Elizabeth.  \"Now who's to be architect?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you, Bess!\" said Tommy; \"we're no good at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I'm not either,\" said Elizabeth, laughing.  \"But I suppose\r\nwe ought to put up some posts for the walls, and weave rushes and\r\nthings between them.  Anyway, the first thing is to cut down some stout\r\nsaplings that will be strong enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there are plenty in the woods; quite close too,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"But how can we cut them down?\" asked Mary; \"we haven't axes or saws.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have our knives, though,\" said Tommy.  \"Come on, let's begin.\"\r\n\r\nThey went into the wood, where the trees at the edge were not at all\r\ndense, and selected several saplings of about the same height and\r\nthickness.  Then each dropped on her knees before one of the saplings,\r\nscratched a circular line on the bark and began to hack away at this\r\nwith the knife.  For some time nothing was heard but the slight sounds\r\nmade by the knives; each girl worked hard as though engaged in a\r\ncompetition.  But presently Tommy straightened her back, and uttered a\r\nsort of sighing grunt.\r\n\r\n\"How are you getting on?\" asked Elizabeth, without desisting from her\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" cried Tommy, stooping and setting to work furiously.\r\n\"They shan't beat me,\" she said to herself.\r\n\r\nBut in a few minutes Mary gave a plaintive little exclamation, dropped\r\nher knife, and rubbed her right hand with her left.\r\n\r\n\"You're _soon_ tired,\" said Tommy, working harder than ever.\r\n\r\n\"I think my tree must be a specially tough one,\" said Mary.  \"I don't\r\nseem to make much impression, and my wrist does ache so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a rest, dear,\" said Elizabeth.  \"Shouldn't we get on better if\r\ntwo worked at the same tree while the other rested?  We could take it\r\nin turns.  When we have cut down the first, we shall have something to\r\nshow for our work.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good idea!\" said Tommy, springing up and running to Elizabeth's\r\ntree.  \"You take first spell off, Mary.\"\r\n\r\nThe two girls worked at the trunk from opposite sides.  The air was\r\ngrowing hotter and hotter, the insects became very troublesome, and as\r\ntime went on and the incisions they had made in the sappy wood were\r\nstill very shallow, both felt very much discouraged.\r\n\r\n\"We shall never get through the wretched thing,\" said Tommy in disgust.\r\n\"Can't we snap it off, Bess?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid that would only splinter it,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It is a\r\nbother.  What troubles me most is that our knives will be hopelessly\r\nblunted if it takes so long to cut one tree.  Still, we must peg away.\r\nYou rest now, Tommy, and let Mary try again.\"\r\n\r\nTommy got up with relief, and strolled a few yards away while her\r\nsisters continued the work.  In a few minutes she came running back.\r\n\r\n\"What idiots we are!\" she cried.  \"Stop work, you two.  We needn't\r\nbreak our backs or our wrists at all.  Come and look.\"\r\n\r\nShe led them to the edge of the grassy knoll, and pointed to three\r\nsmall trees standing within a few feet of each other about the same\r\ndistance apart, and forming the corners of a sort of triangle.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" she said.  \"Don't you see?  There's half our work done for us.\r\nThose three trees can be the corner posts of our hut, and we can use\r\nthe branches to make a roof.\"\r\n\r\nQuite excited at her discovery, she pointed out that two of the trees\r\nhad each thrown out a branch about seven feet from the ground, and the\r\nthird had a branch a little higher.  These overhanging branches\r\nprotected one side of the triangle, and Tommy suggested that they could\r\nbe employed as a framework upon which they might spread mats woven from\r\nthe grasses on the bank of the stream.\r\n\r\n\"It would take a terrible time to weave the mats,\" said Mary dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"Not so long as to cut down the trees,\" replied Tommy, \"and not nearly\r\nso hard work.  What do you say, Bess?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a capital idea, but I can't weave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we'll soon teach you that,\" said Tommy.  \"You didn't go to a\r\nkindergarten like Mary and me; but it's not very different from the\r\nstring work you did on board.  Come along; let's make a start.\"\r\n\r\nThey went hopefully to the bank of the stream, but when they tried to\r\ncut down the rushes, they found that their knives were already blunt.\r\nAs the day was now very hot, and they were hungry and tired, they\r\nresolved to have an early dinner, then rest for a while, and later on\r\nsharpen their knives on stones at the beach and try again.\r\n\r\nBy the evening they had cut a large quantity of grasses, which they\r\nplaced in a heap to be weaved next day.  They decided again to sleep in\r\nthe boat, and returned to it just before sunset by way of the clump of\r\nbanana-trees, carrying their supper with them.\r\n\r\n\"We have made a good start,\" said Elizabeth cheerfully, as they sat\r\nmunching bananas in the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I tell you what,\" said Tommy, \"I'm getting tired of bananas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Already!\" said Mary, smiling.  \"Don't you remember how you said once\r\nat home you'd love to live in a banana plantation, where you could pick\r\nas many as you liked?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you told me the story of a greedy boy who loved cake, and dreamt\r\nthat he was in the middle of a big one, and had to eat his way out.  I\r\nwas a silly kid then.  Anyway, I'm sick of bananas now, and people say\r\nit's bad to have no change of diet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can we do?\" said Elizabeth.  \"We haven't seen anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except birds,\" said Mary.  \"Pigeon-pie is rather nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might snare some,\" said Tommy, \"or fish--what about fish?  They'd\r\nbe easiest to catch, I expect.  I've got some string, and we can easily\r\nfind something that'll do for a rod.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a bent pin for a hook,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Now just listen to that!\" said Tommy.  \"Anybody would think we were\r\ngoing fishing for sticklebacks.  No fish worth cooking would ever let\r\nhimself be hooked by a bent pin.  We'll find something better than\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see what we can do to-morrow,\" said Elizabeth.  \"We've never\r\ndone any sea-fishing, and fishing in the river at home won't help us\r\nmuch, I fancy.  Still, we can try, and I'd like a little fish for a\r\nchange.  You both look awfully tired, so let's go to sleep now; we\r\nshall have plenty to do in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Elizabeth, as she laid herself down that night, felt happy in the\r\nsuccess of her plan.  \"If we can only keep busy,\" she said to herself,\r\n\"all will be well.  But I do hope it won't be for long.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE FISHERS\r\n\r\nUp with the sun next morning, the girls began the day by bathing in a\r\nlittle secluded pool, where there was no danger of being interrupted by\r\na shark.  Immediately after breakfast they set off to the site of their\r\nhut, looked cautiously around to make sure that no one had been there,\r\nand began to weave the grasses they had prepared the day before.\r\nElizabeth was at first rather slow, but the others worked quickly, and\r\nby dinner-time they had each finished a mat several feet square.\r\n\r\n\"You two have quite outstripped me,\" said Elizabeth as they returned to\r\nthe boat.  \"I'll go on with my mat after dinner, while you see what you\r\ncan do to make some fishing-tackle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" cried Tommy; \"you shall have fish for supper, if you're good.\"\r\n\r\nThey dined on bananas and coffee, ruefully noticing that the tin of\r\ncondensed milk was nearly empty.  Then Mary and Tommy went up the\r\nstream to a place where they had seen a clump of canes, which would\r\nfurnish any number of fishing-rods.  They selected one about six feet\r\nlong, and after a good deal of trouble, the wood being tough, cut it\r\ndown.  Tommy brought out of her pocket two or three pieces of string of\r\nunequal length and thickness, and knotted them together.\r\n\r\n\"There's our line,\" she said, \"and it's lucky there's no one here to\r\nlaugh at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we fasten it on to the rod?\" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Tie it, of course.\"\r\n\r\nTommy proceeded to tie the string to the thinner end of the rod.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bother!\" she said, \"the cane's so smooth the string slips down\r\nevery time.  This won't do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's make a hole in the rod, and put the string through it,\"\r\nsuggested Mary.\r\n\r\n\"The cane is sure to split if we try to bore a hole with a knife,\" said\r\nTommy.  \"I know!  There's a sort of spike in my knife.  We'll make it\r\nred-hot, and then I dare say we can bore a clean hole.\"\r\n\r\nThey ran back to their little camp on the beach, where Elizabeth was\r\nstill at work on her mat.\r\n\r\n\"How are you getting on?\" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Faster now,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"I shall beat you both soon.\"\r\n\r\nThey told her what they had done, and Tommy thrust the spike into the\r\nfire, which they never allowed to go out.  Meanwhile, Mary hunted for\r\nsomething that would serve as a hook.  She gave a cry of delight when\r\nshe discovered a strong safety-pin; and Tommy having by this time bored\r\na hole neatly through the cane, they very soon had their\r\nrough-and-ready fishing-tackle complete.  It only remained to bait the\r\nhook.  They found plenty of small shellfish clinging fast to the rocks\r\non the shore, and they prised these up with their knives, and provided\r\nthemselves with a number of the little molluscs.  Thus equipped, they\r\nwent along the shore in search of a spot that promised success.  They\r\nwere both excited--and Elizabeth was so much interested in the\r\nexperiment that she laid down her mat and followed her sisters.  After\r\na little time they came to an irregular line of rocks running from the\r\nbase of the cliffs towards the reef on which they had nearly struck on\r\napproaching the island.  They had already observed that some of the\r\nrocks always stood above water, while others were sometimes submerged.\r\nThese latter were easily distinguishable by the seaweed and the limpets\r\nwith which they were covered.  At the present moment the tide was going\r\ndown, and the girls thought that they would have a good chance of\r\ncatching some of the fish that had probably come up with the tide.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they made their way for some distance along the rocky\r\nbarrier.  The sea was pretty calm, owing to the protection of the reef;\r\nbut every now and then there was a dash of spray over the rocks at the\r\nfarthest end.  Choosing a rock that was lashed by broken water on the\r\nseaward side, and had a deep calm pool on the landward side, they\r\ndetermined to try their luck.\r\n\r\n\"I can see hundreds of fish darting about,\" said Mary, peering into the\r\npool as Tommy baited the hook.\r\n\r\n\"The more the merrier,\" said Tommy.  \"Look out, Bess, I don't want to\r\nhook you, dear.\"\r\n\r\nThe other girls gave Tommy a wide berth as she cast her hook, then came\r\nto her side and waited for the expected catch.  She had not put on a\r\nfloat, declaring that any fish worth catching would soon make itself\r\nfelt.  But as she drew the line towards her she had no sense of weight\r\nor resistance; the hook came up with the bait untouched.\r\n\r\n\"They don't fancy it, apparently,\" said Tommy.  \"I'll have another try.\r\nLook out!\"  Again she cast the line, and again drew it in.\r\n\r\n\"I declare, the little wretches are nibbling the bait off under our\r\nvery noses,\" she cried, as the hook passed through the clear water of\r\nthe pool.  \"How disgusting!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor little things! why shouldn't they enjoy themselves?\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! if you're going to talk like that, I've done,\" said Tommy,\r\nflinging down the rod impatiently.\r\n\r\nElizabeth picked it up.\r\n\r\n\"Let me try,\" she said.\r\n\r\nShe baited the hook again, but had no more success than her sister.\r\n\r\n\"It is exasperating,\" she said.  \"I'm surprised the fish here are so\r\nclever.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better have tried a bent pin as I suggested,\" said Mary.  \"You'd\r\nhave caught some of those little chaps swarming there.  The safety-pin\r\nis too big for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who wants little skinny things?\" said Tommy.  \"I'd like a haddock or a\r\ncod.  Let me try again, Bess.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the hook was baited and let down.  Again it was surrounded by\r\na swarm of eager nibblers, and Tommy was on the point of drawing it\r\nback in disgust when suddenly the crowd of little fish parted and\r\nscattered in all directions, darting off like streaks of light.  The\r\ngirls held their breath as they saw a \"whopper,\" as Tommy called it,\r\ncome slowly towards the bait.  It seemed to smell at it, moving round\r\nwith flicks of its tail.  Then it opened its mouth--and Tommy felt a\r\ntug on the line.\r\n\r\n\"Got him!\" she cried triumphantly.  \"A monster, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe other girls watched her as she drew it in.  She wasted no time in\r\nplaying it, but simply hauled it up towards the rock.  Bess stooped,\r\nand while Mary held her to prevent her from stumbling into the sea, she\r\nslipped her hands underneath the fish and jerked it out of the water.\r\n\r\n\"He's not such a monster after all,\" said Mary.  \"How deceptive the\r\nwater is!\"\r\n\r\nThe fish, indeed, was no bigger than a good-sized haddock.\r\n\r\n\"It is big enough to make us a good supper,\" said Elizabeth, \"and I\r\ndon't think we should try to catch any more now.  They won't keep in\r\nthis climate.  Tommy can catch some every day if she likes.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Tommy.  \"But, I say, I can't wait till supper-time.\r\nThe look of the fish gives me an appetite.  I vote we have it for tea.\r\nYou're cook, Bess.  I'll finish your mat while you're getting the fish\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\nThis was agreed upon, and they returned to the camp.  The two younger\r\ngirls resumed the weaving, while Elizabeth, using a flat stone as a\r\nkitchen table, set about cleaning the fish in a very housewifely manner.\r\n\r\nAll at once Mary dropped her hands and cried \"Oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose the fish is poisonous!  Some are, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goodness, yes!  What can we do?  We haven't a taster, like some old\r\nkings I've read about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" said Elizabeth tranquilly.  \"We must have a change of\r\nfood, and there's bound to be a little risk in trying new things.\r\nWe'll cook it, and I'll eat a little.  We shall soon know if there's\r\nany harm in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Bess,\" said Mary.  \"Why should you take the risk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somebody must, and I'm the eldest--and the toughest, I expect, so that\r\nif it does make me ill I shall get over it sooner than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I did so want a snack!\" sighed Tommy.  \"You won't eat much, will\r\nyou, Bess?  We couldn't spare you, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be careful,\" said Elizabeth, with a smile.  \"It looks very\r\ntempting, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Bess; you make my mouth water,\" said Tommy.  \"How are you going\r\nto fry it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought of boiling it in the kettle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't do that,\" said Mary.  \"I don't care for fishy tea.  It\r\nwould take ages to get the taste out of the kettle.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see how we can fry it without a frying-pan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bake it,\" said Tommy.  \"Let's make an oven.  I'll show you.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran to the beach and collected a number of stones, which she\r\nbrought back and arranged in the shape of a small circle.  Outside this\r\nshe placed a second circle, and filled the space between the two with\r\ndried grasses, brushwood and twigs.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Bess,\" she said, \"but a portion of the fish in the inner circle.\r\nThen we'll set light to the fuel, and cover it all over with stones,\r\nand the fish will bake in no time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it will be smoky,\" protested Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Not if we wrap it in leaves.  Let's try, at any rate; if it doesn't\r\nsucceed we shan't have spoiled much.\"\r\n\r\nThe fish was wrapped in leaves as Tommy suggested, and placed on a\r\nstone in the midst of the small circle.  Then, having pressed the fuel\r\nfirmly together so that it should not burn away too quickly, Elizabeth\r\nkindled it from the fire, and covered it with stones, leaving a few\r\nspaces for the passage of air.  They were so much interested in their\r\nexperiment that they sat idly about the novel oven, waiting until the\r\nfish should be cooked.  Every now and again Tommy would lift off one of\r\nthe stones to see how the cooking was proceeding.\r\n\r\n\"The leaves are turning brown,\" she would say delightedly.  \"And what a\r\nlovely smell!\"\r\n\r\nAfter about a quarter of an hour they removed the stones and the\r\nwrappings, and Elizabeth declared the fish was done.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't look so nice as if we'd had egg and bread-crumbs,\" she\r\nsaid, \"but we must do without those luxuries.\"\r\n\r\nShe tasted a small portion.\r\n\r\n\"Very nice,\" she said, \"in spite of no salt or pepper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't eat too much,\" said Mary anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I must give it a fair trial.  Make the tea, Tommy, will you?  A cup of\r\ntea will qualify the poison if there is any.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a nerve you've got!\" said Tommy admiringly.\r\n\r\nSoon all were drinking tea, and the younger girls munched bananas,\r\nwhile Elizabeth ate a few small pieces of the baked fish.  They watched\r\nher with anxiety mingled with envy.\r\n\r\n\"Really, you mustn't eat any more,\" said Tommy at last.  \"Now rest\r\nagainst the side of the boat.\"  She placed a shawl behind her sister's\r\nhead, and covered her feet with her macintosh.\r\n\r\n\"Any one would think I was an invalid,\" said Elizabeth, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"It's nothing to laugh at,\" said Mary severely.  \"You may be very ill\r\nby and by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile put the rest of the fish where the flies and insects can't\r\nget at it,\" said Elizabeth.  \"There's a nice little hollow in that rock\r\nover there.  Cover it with leaves.\"\r\n\r\nThis done, they sat one on each side of Elizabeth, propping their chins\r\non their hands, and gazing at her with mournful interest.\r\n\r\n\"This is _too_ absurd,\" said Elizabeth, after a few minutes.  \"Let us\r\nget on with our hut.  I can't stand being stared at like this.  Come\r\nalong, girls.  We must cut down some more canes to make walls; I'll\r\nshow you what I mean.\"\r\n\r\nThey went up-stream to the clump of canes, and, selecting some of the\r\nlongest, proceeded to hack them down with their knives--no easy task,\r\nfor the longest canes were also the thickest.  But after a little\r\ntrouble they got three or four that Elizabeth thought would answer her\r\npurpose, and took them to the site chosen for the hut.  Here they laid\r\nthe canes across the projecting branches of the three trees, binding\r\nthem firmly in place with strong tendrils of a creeping plant.  After\r\nan hour's work all the canes were in position, forming a kind of\r\nframework for the roof.\r\n\r\n\"Now all we have to do is to cover this with matting, and our roof is\r\nfinished,\" said Elizabeth.  \"We shall have to get some more canes to\r\nstretch matting on for the walls, and as we have used up nearly all the\r\ngrasses we collected, we had better go at once to get some more ready\r\nfor to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow!\" cried Mary.  \"I'd forgotten!  Do you feel quite well,\r\nBess?\"\r\n\r\n\"As well as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long is it since you ate the fish?\" asked Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"More than two hours--long enough for the poison to act, I'm sure.  So\r\nwe may make up our minds that the fish is perfectly wholesome, and\r\nthere's baked fish for supper for all of us to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurray!\" said Tommy, beginning to dance.  \"Let's go and get the\r\ngrasses; by the time we have got enough to make our mats it will be\r\nsupper-time.  Oh!  I am so glad you are not ill, Bess.\"\r\n\r\nThey spent an hour or two in gathering grasses, and returned to their\r\nlittle camp shortly before sunset, in order to cook their supper before\r\ndark.  Tommy ran to the hole in the rock where the fish had been left.\r\nA cry of dismay startled her sisters.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" they cried, turning towards her.\r\n\r\n\"It's gone, every bit of it; oh, who has stolen it?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked round with alarm in her eyes, and the other girls also\r\nglanced about them with consternation and anxiety.  Was it possible\r\nthat some one had been spying on them?\r\n\r\n\"I _did_ see somebody that day,\" said Tommy in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"But who would want to steal a bit of fish?\" said Elizabeth, with\r\npractical common-sense.  \"If there are natives here, they could fish\r\nfor themselves, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"There aren't any cats in these parts, are there, Mary?\" asked Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"I never read of them.  But--good gracious!\" she cried suddenly, \"there\r\nare the bones!\"\r\n\r\nShe had looked a little farther into the hole than Tommy had done, and\r\nthere lay the skeleton of the fish picked clean of every bit of flesh.\r\n\r\n\"I know what it is,\" she said.  \"It's a land-crab's hole, and the\r\nwretch smelt the fish, I suppose, and came out for a feast while we\r\nwere busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mean thing!\" cried Tommy.  \"And we shan't have any fish for supper\r\nafter all.  I'll serve him out.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran to the boat and brought back the boat-hook, with which she\r\npoked vigorously in the hole.  In a few minutes a large crab came\r\nscuttling out, at the sight of which she picked up her skirt and ran\r\naway, not liking the look of his formidable nippers.\r\n\r\nThey supped as usual on bananas and tea, resolving to choose a safer\r\nlarder when next they kept fish for a future meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE BROWN FACE\r\n\r\n\"I say, my hair is in a terrible tangle,\" said Mary next morning, after\r\nthey had bathed.  \"I wish we had a comb.\"\r\n\r\nIn the haste of their dressing, the last night on the _Elizabeth_, they\r\nhad done up their hair anyhow, forgetting all about their combs.\r\n\r\n\"What do the South Sea natives do, Mary?\" asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"I fancy I've read that they build up their hair into a sort of huge\r\nturban, with grease and things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrid!\" said Tommy.  \"I vote we cut our hair short like a boy's;\r\nyou've got a pair of scissors in your housewife, Mary.  Then it won't\r\nbother any of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that would be wise,\" said Elizabeth; \"we might get\r\nsunstroke.  As it is we are protected a little.  I'm going to let my\r\nhair down.  Perhaps we might make a comb out of a bit of wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"A long fiddling job that will be,\" said Tommy.  \"I'm going to catch a\r\nfish for breakfast, and if it's like the one I caught yesterday, take\r\nout the backbone and use that for a comb.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's rather an original idea,\" said Elizabeth.  \"Won't our hair\r\nsmell fishy, though?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if we wash the bone and then dry it in the sun, I should think.\r\nAnyway, we can try.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls went off together to the rocks from which they had fished on\r\nthe previous day.  The first fish they hooked was of a different kind\r\nfrom the one whose wholesomeness they had proved, and Tommy threw it\r\nback into the sea, saying that she could not wait while another\r\nexperiment was being tried.  After a time she landed one of the right\r\nsort, and this, when baked, made a capital breakfast for them all.  No\r\nbiscuit remained, and Tommy sighed for bread and butter; but they\r\nenjoyed the change of fare.  They washed the skeleton as Tommy had\r\nsuggested, and set it to dry in the sun.  Then they resumed their\r\nweaving.  Elizabeth made some rough measurements, and found that a\r\ngreat deal more matting was required than they anticipated, so that\r\nseveral days must pass before they could begin the actual building of\r\nthe hut.\r\n\r\nMary and Elizabeth had both set their watches by the sun, and so were\r\nable to tell with reasonable accuracy the time of day.  But they had\r\nnot kept count of the days as they passed, and now Elizabeth suggested\r\nthat they should each morning cut a notch in one of the trees to serve\r\nas a calendar.\r\n\r\nThat night they tested the comb of fishbone.  Mary's hair was the\r\nfinest, and she managed to comb out its tangles fairly well; but when\r\nElizabeth tried to do the same with her thicker and stronger locks,\r\nseveral of the bones snapped off, and it was clear that a new comb of\r\nthis sort would be needed every day.  She reverted, therefore, to her\r\nidea of trying to make a wooden comb; and during the next few days,\r\nMary, who had had some practice in fretwork at home, worked with her\r\nknife at a thin fragment of wood.\r\n\r\nIt was a difficult task.  She found herself quite unable to make the\r\nteeth equal in size, or equal in distance from each other.  But she\r\npersevered, and on the third evening after starting the work she showed\r\nthe comb to her sisters.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's half-way between a curry-comb and a garden rake,\" said\r\nTommy, with a laugh.  \"But I dare say it's better than fish-bones.  Let\r\nme have first go on my thatch.\"\r\n\r\nShe began to operate upon her hair, a little yell every now and then\r\nproclaiming that the teeth had \"caught.\"  But all the girls voted that\r\nit was better than nothing, and they used it in turn every morning and\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWhen there were six notches on the tree, Elizabeth said that she\r\nthought there was enough matting to complete the walls of the hut, so\r\nthey carried their handiwork up to the knoll.  Tommy climbed into the\r\ntrees, and fastened the upper edges of several mats to the overhanging\r\nboughs, while the other girls stuck a double row of canes into the\r\nground, one inside and the other outside the matting, to keep it\r\nsteady.  The various strips of matting had to be sewn together, and at\r\nthese places an extra long cane was introduced, to which the mats were\r\nfastened by means of thin flexible tendrils.  A day's work sufficed to\r\ncomplete three walls; the fourth side, facing the sea, was left open.\r\n\r\nIt now only remained to complete the roof.  Next day the girls added\r\nother canes to those which they had already laid across the branches,\r\nuntil they formed a close lattice-work.  This they covered with\r\nmatting, and then deliberated whether to finish it off with thatch.  As\r\nchildren they had often helped the thatchers at the farm, so that they\r\nwould not find any difficulty in the work; but they guessed that in so\r\nwarm a climate thatch would harbour insect pests of all kinds, and they\r\ndid not feel comfortable at the thought of having such house-mates.\r\n\r\n\"Still, I think we must chance it,\" said Mary.  \"There's one thing to\r\nbe said, and that is, that the whole contrivance is so slight and\r\nsimple that we can make it all over again if necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all very well,\" said Tommy, \"but we aren't spiders, and I shall\r\nbe pretty mad if there's all this work to do again.  I'd rather do\r\nsomething fresh.\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't found much else to occupy us so far,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\"Anyway, we won't ask you to do the repairs, Tommy, if you don't like\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I didn't mean that,\" said Tommy at once; \"I'll do my fair share,\r\nbut I know I shall get a bit ratty if a silly old storm knocks our nice\r\nhut to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nThe thatching occupied two more days, and then the girls looked with a\r\ngreat deal of pleasure on their neat little hut.\r\n\r\n\"But we haven't done yet,\" said Elizabeth.  \"The thatch will protect us\r\nfrom any ordinary rain, but we're still liable to be swamped by water\r\nrunning down the hill behind.  We had better scrape out a trench all\r\nround, to carry the water down to the shore.\"\r\n\r\nThis proved the hardest part of the work.  They had no tools except\r\ntheir knives and the boat-hook, and with these to cut a trench deep\r\nenough to be effective was very trying to their patience.  Such\r\ncontinuous plodding work did not suit Tommy's restless, active\r\ntemperament at all, and she would constantly jump up and run off to the\r\nbeach, or to the edge of the wood.  At such times Mary was inclined to\r\nbe impatient and reproachful, but Elizabeth said that they mustn't\r\nexpect too much from Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"She's very young, you know, and it's really wonderful how her spirits\r\nhave kept up so well.  She's more nervy than we are, Mary, and I am\r\nalways afraid she will break down.\"\r\n\r\nSo neither she nor Mary said anything to Tommy about her fitfulness,\r\nand Tommy herself always came back repentant after these little\r\nabsences, and worked away hard until the next fit of restlessness\r\novertook her.\r\n\r\nTo give her a change from scraping away at the trench, Elizabeth\r\nsuggested that she should make a mat curtain for the open side of the\r\nhut.\r\n\r\n\"We don't want a door,\" she said, \"but a curtain will be useful at\r\nnight.  Leave a little space between it and the roof for ventilation.\r\nWe can fasten the two lower corners to the canes.\"\r\n\r\nTommy set about this task willingly, and had the curtain fixed by the\r\ntime the trench was finished.  The hut was now complete so far as its\r\nexterior was concerned; it had taken more than a fortnight altogether.\r\nWhat they had now to consider was the internal fittings.  Tommy laughed\r\nwhen this was mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"We can't get a bedroom suite, even on the hire system,\" she said.  \"I\r\nsuppose you'd call it a bed-sitting-room, wouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's call it 'Our Flat,'\" suggested Mary.\r\n\r\n\"The best flat that ever was,\" said Tommy.  \"No botherations from\r\nunpleasant neighbours--at least, I hope not.\"\r\n\r\n\"We certainly shan't have a tiresome piano going next door,\" said\r\nElizabeth.  \"I think 'Our Flat' is a very good name.  What a pity we\r\nhaven't a table and pen, ink and paper!--then Mary could write a diary\r\nof our doings.\"\r\n\r\n\"With moral reflections,\" added Tommy.  \"'To-day our youngest sister\r\nrefused to wash up; how sad to see such a selfish spirit in one so\r\nyoung!'  That's the sort of thing, isn't it, Mary?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't write anything of the sort,\" said Mary indignantly.  \"You\r\nhaven't refused to wash up, and if you did, do you think I should tell\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, you are perfectly killing,\" said Tommy.  \"Do you think you'd\r\nget your old diary published?  No one would read it if you did.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're talking nonsense, aren't we?\" said Elizabeth.  \"There's no\r\nchance of any of us writing a diary.  Let's be practical.  The only\r\nfurniture we can supply ourselves with is--beds.\"\r\n\r\n\"More weaving?\" cried Tommy.  \"Oh, I am so sick of it, Bess.  Can't we\r\nsleep on the ground?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think we'd better; we might get rheumatism, though to be sure\r\nthe ground seems dry enough at present.  But I own that weaving mats\r\nday after day is rather tiring, so shall we leave it for the present,\r\nand still sleep in the boat?  What do you say to doing a little more\r\nexploration?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, why not?\" said Tommy eagerly.  \"We haven't seen a soul--since I\r\nsaw that figure move along the top of the ridge, at any rate; and I\r\ndare say that was an animal of some kind.  I don't think there are any\r\npeople here at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"There may be some on the other side of the ridge,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if there are, they must be a very unenterprising lot,\" said\r\nTommy.  \"Let's follow up the stream to its source.  I've never seen the\r\nsource of a river, and that'll be geography, won't it?  Besides, our\r\nbananas will soon be all gone, and we ought to look for some more; we\r\ncan't live on nothing but fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; we will do as you say,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It's very hot\r\nto-day, so we'll cover our heads with leaves; it's just as well to take\r\nprecautions.\"\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards they set out, carrying the oars and the boat-hook as\r\nweapons of defence.  Although they had gained confidence from never\r\nhaving seen any human being, as soon as they had walked beyond the\r\nlimit of their previous excursions they felt something of the old\r\ntimidity, and spoke only in whispers.\r\n\r\n\"Our flag is still flying,\" said Tommy, as they came to a spot whence\r\nthey could see the tree she had climbed on their first day on the\r\nisland.  \"Evidently no one has seen it or thought it worth noticing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a consolation in one way,\" said Elizabeth.  \"These South Sea\r\nIslanders have canoes, haven't they, Mary?  We haven't seen any, which\r\nis a negative proof that our island isn't inhabited; but if any people\r\nfrom another island happened to have come this way, they would almost\r\ncertainly have noticed our flag, and perhaps come to see what it meant.\"\r\n\r\nThey were following the course of the stream.  It zigzagged about a\r\ngood deal, at first through a fairly thick belt of woodland, then\r\nthrough a comparatively clear space of a few hundred yards, then into\r\nwoodland again, always narrowing.  They were still some distance below\r\nthe crest of the ridge when they came to a small swamp, beyond which\r\nthere was no stream.\r\n\r\n\"This must be the source,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"How disappointing!\" said Tommy.  \"I wanted to see a nice little\r\nspring, with beautiful clear water bubbling up.  This swamp is simply\r\nhorrid.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must be a spring somewhere in the swamp,\" said Elizabeth,\r\nsmiling.  \"But it isn't worth while to hunt for it, even if we could\r\nfind it.  The stream is certainly prettier lower down.  Let's go on; we\r\nare not very far from the top, and we might be able to get a good view\r\nfrom there--see the whole of the island and the sea beyond.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel quite like a discoverer,\" said Mary.  \"Can't you imagine how\r\nDrake must have felt when he first caught sight of the Pacific?\"\r\n\r\n\"You romantic old dear!\" cried Tommy.  \"I don't care a bit what Drake\r\nfelt; all I hope is we shan't wish we hadn't come.\"\r\n\r\nThey went on quietly, feeling a little nervous.  The ground here was\r\nbare except for a few shrubs, and they drew their breath more quickly\r\nas they mounted the slope.  At last they reached the top.  One and all\r\ngave a sigh of disappointment.  Directly in front of them, to the\r\nnorth, was a second ridge higher than the one on which they stood.  But\r\non every other side there was a fine view.  To the south the land fell\r\naway rapidly towards the sea, of which they caught a glimpse over the\r\ntree-tops nearly a mile away.  To the west, the direction from which\r\nthey had come, the sea was much farther off.  To the east there was a\r\ngradual slope downwards into a country for the most part densely\r\nwooded, but here and there showing traces of clearings natural or\r\notherwise.  The greatest extent of land seemed to be to the north-east,\r\nwhere the sea was much farther remote than it was on the west.  None of\r\nthe girls had any experience in judging distances, but they saw that\r\nthe island was longer than it was broad, and that the greatest length\r\nwas from north-west to south-east.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we go to the farther ridge?\" asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, let's,\" said Tommy.  \"There isn't a sign of a living creature;\r\nthe island is just ours.\"\r\n\r\nA thick belt of woodland separated the two ridges at the point where\r\nthey stood, so they moved somewhat to the right to search for a more\r\nopen way.  All at once they came to a halt.  A little in front of them\r\nwas a pole, carrying what appeared to be the remains of a small flag.\r\nAbout fifty paces beyond it was another exactly similar; and then they\r\nsaw that there were five or six altogether, extending along the crest\r\nof the ridge, all the same distance apart.\r\n\r\n\"I think we had better go back,\" said Mary, looking a trifle scared.\r\n\"There are people after all.\"\r\n\r\nHer sisters were equally disturbed at the sight of poles evidently\r\nerected by human agency.  There was nobody to be seen, and from the\r\nappearance of the poles they were not attended to; the flags on them\r\nwere the merest rags of coloured cloth.  But the girls were not\r\ninclined to face any more discoveries.  The bare possibility that there\r\nwere savages on the island made them shiver.  They paused for a few\r\nmoments at the spot where they first caught sight of the poles, and\r\nthen turned, intending to make their way in the direction of home.\r\n\r\nJust then, however, Tommy caught sight of some bananas clustering thick\r\na little way down the slope on the eastern side.\r\n\r\n\"I'm hungry,\" she said.  \"Those look bigger than what we have had.\r\nCouldn't we go and fetch a few?\"\r\n\r\nThe clump of trees lay on the slope below the line of poles, a good\r\ndistance away from them.\r\n\r\n\"It's rather silly to be scared so easily,\" said Elizabeth.  \"There\r\nisn't a sign of anybody; I think we might venture.  We must find a new\r\nsupply.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved quickly down towards the trees, listening, peering about\r\nthem, ready to fly at the least alarm.  But when they came to the trees\r\nthey felt that they had the reward of courage, for there, within a\r\nshort distance of them, was a sight that made them gasp with surprise\r\nand delight.  Beside the stumpy, long-leaved banana-trees, there were\r\nother trees glittering with green and yellow fruit and with white\r\nblossom.  The laden boughs bent down invitingly, and beneath them the\r\ngolden globes of fallen fruit glowed amid the grass.\r\n\r\n\"Oranges, I declare!\" exclaimed Mary.\r\n\r\n\"How lovely!\" cried Tommy, forgetting all her fears, and running\r\nforward to pick an orange from the ground.\r\n\r\nHer sisters followed more leisurely, but before they reached her Tommy\r\nsuddenly uttered a cry of terror.  The orange she had taken fell from\r\nher hand.  The other girls ran to her side and found her pale with\r\nfright.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" she said, pointing towards a clump of hibiscus.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, dear?\" asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"In the bushes--a little brown face!\" whispered Tommy, with trembling\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nANXIOUS DAYS\r\n\r\nFor a moment, under the shock of the startling piece of news, Elizabeth\r\nwas tempted to seize her sisters by the hand and run.  Tommy was so\r\npractical and unimaginative a young person that she could hardly have\r\nbeen altogether mistaken, and a \"little brown face,\" if face it was,\r\nmust belong to a native.  But Elizabeth thought quickly, and even while\r\nher heart was galloping with nervous excitement, she made up her mind\r\nthat to run away now was not the right course.  A show of bravery was\r\nmuch more likely to serve them.  If there really was a native in\r\nhiding, he would certainly have seen them, and to run or slink away now\r\nwould merely provoke pursuit, in which the fugitives would be at a\r\ngreat disadvantage.  Summoning all her courage, therefore, Elizabeth\r\nadvanced towards the bush to which Tommy had pointed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go, Bess,\" implored Tommy in an agitated whisper, and Mary, as\r\npale as a sheet, put an arm about the younger girl.\r\n\r\nElizabeth went straight on, looking carefully around.\r\n\r\n\"Is this it?\" she asked quietly, turning towards her sisters, now\r\nseveral yards distant.\r\n\r\nTommy merely nodded; Mary murmured, \"How _could_ she do it?\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth peered into the bush.  There was no little brown face now,\r\nnor, though she went to and fro amongst the trees beyond, could she see\r\nany one, brown or white, lurking.  She listened as the thought struck\r\nher that it might have been a monkey, and she had heard monkeys\r\nscreaming and chattering in the Zoological Gardens in London; but there\r\nwas no sound, not even the twitter or squawk of a bird.\r\n\r\nBrave as she was in outward mien, Elizabeth, after a few minutes'\r\nsearch, returned with hasty step to her sisters.\r\n\r\n\"My silly heart!\" she said, with a faint smile, placing her hand to her\r\nside.  \"I couldn't see anything.  Tommy; don't you think you may have\r\nimagined it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you did before,\" added Mary.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't!\" cried Tommy.  \"Why won't you believe me?  I _did_ see a\r\nbrown face; I am sure I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very strange,\" said Elizabeth.  \"We were here only a few seconds\r\nafter you cried out; there wasn't much time for any one to get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are both horrible,\" said Tommy, her lips quivering.  \"Any one\r\nwould think I was a fool.  I'll prove that I was right, whatever\r\nhappens.\"\r\n\r\nWith the courage of indignation she pulled Elizabeth towards the clump\r\nof bushes, and began to examine the soft mossy carpet.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" she cried triumphantly, yet fearfully, pointing presently to a\r\nmark on the ground.  Elizabeth stooped and made out two or three faint\r\nimpressions of a foot smaller even than Tommy's.  And then Tommy's fear\r\nreturned in full force.  With a little cry she dragged Elizabeth from\r\nthe spot, and since nothing is so catching as fear even Elizabeth's\r\ncourage gave way, and soon all three girls were running as hard as they\r\ncould run towards the stream, and did not halt until they came to the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"'THERE!' SHE CRIED TRIUMPHANTLY, YET FEARFULLY.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear, how ashamed I am!\" panted Elizabeth, as they threw\r\nthemselves down on the sand to rest.\r\n\r\n\"You were very brave,\" said Mary.  \"I couldn't have gone into those\r\nbushes for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they were marks of a monkey's feet,\" said Elizabeth.  \"How\r\nsilly I was not to examine them more closely.\"\r\n\r\n\"They weren't,\" said Tommy.  \"I saw them quite plainly.  They were feet\r\njust like yours and mine, only tiny, wee things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if the people here are dwarfs,\" said Mary.  \"There must be\r\npeople.  That's certain now.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they are dwarfs they must be more afraid of us than we are of\r\nthem,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" said Tommy.  \"I was never in such a fright in my life.\r\nOh!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Elizabeth, with an anxious look around.\r\n\r\n\"The oranges! we haven't got any, and I shall be afraid to go there\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a pity,\" said Elizabeth; \"they looked so nice.  Perhaps we can\r\nfind some in another part of the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't look for any,\" said Tommy.  \"I won't stir from this place--at\r\nleast not farther than to the bananas, and they're nearly all gone.\r\nWhat if the savages come and attack us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of them have poisoned arrows,\" said Mary, quaking.\r\n\r\n\"Really, I think we are crying before we are hurt,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\"We haven't been molested so far, and surely that proves that whatever\r\npeople there are, they are not very terrible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know I shan't sleep a wink to-night,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't we better launch the boat and spend the night on the sea?\" said\r\nMary.  \"They might attack us in the darkness.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll drag it down a little nearer the sea,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and\r\nwe can take turns to keep watch, if you like; but I'm sure we oughtn't\r\nto show the white feather.  The best thing we can do is to forget all\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's easy to say, but I know I shan't forget it as long as I live,\"\r\ncried Tommy.  \"And we were so jolly; it's all spoilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we _must_ eat,\" said Elizabeth, afraid of a breakdown.  \"Let us\r\ncook some fish, and be as comfortable as we can.\"\r\n\r\nThey spent the rest of that day in a state of nervousness, and although\r\nElizabeth tried to get the others to begin weaving their mat beds for\r\nthe hut, they had no heart for the work.  When darkness fell, they drew\r\nthe boat down to the very verge of high water, and lay in it, but not\r\nto sleep.  They had arranged that each should take a turn at keeping\r\nwatch, but the result was that all were wakeful, and except for a few\r\nminutes' uneasy dozing, none of them had any rest.\r\n\r\n\"This will never do,\" thought Elizabeth as it drew towards morning.\r\n\"We shall all be worn out if we don't get our proper sleep.  I do hope\r\nthe natives will come to us to-morrow so that we can make friends with\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThey all looked very weary and washed-out when daylight came.  There\r\nwas no fish left, and Tommy seemed disinclined to try to catch any, or\r\nto go to the banana-trees for food.\r\n\r\n\"Come, girls, this really won't do,\" said Elizabeth briskly.  \"Make\r\nsome tea, Tommy, while Mary and I go and get a fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's only enough for about a cup each,\" said Tommy, looking\r\ndolefully into the caddy.\r\n\r\n\"We shan't get any more by wishing for it,\" said Elizabeth, \"so we'll\r\nuse it all up and then try to make a sort of cider out of bananas.  It\r\nwill be a change.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are hardly any bananas left, either,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll go prowling in search of more as soon as we really come to\r\nthe last of them.  Come along, Mary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go out of sight, will you?\" said Tommy, as they moved away.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not, we shan't be long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had a change of things, Bess,\" said Mary, as they hastened\r\ntowards their fishing rock.  \"Never in my life have I worn my underwear\r\nso long; it's horrid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't we have a washing-day?\" said Elizabeth.  \"It will be a\r\nnovelty, and give us something to do and think about.  Rather fun too,\r\nwith no soap.  How can we manage?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've read somewhere that the women in the East wash their clothes by\r\nbeating them in a running stream with stones,\" said Mary.  \"The stream\r\nand the stones are handy; we might try that plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't the stones knock holes in them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They use flat, round stones, without sharp edges, I think.  It will be\r\nrather fun to try, anyway.  I hope the savages won't come, Bess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, I'm not at all sure that it wasn't the footprint of a\r\nmonkey or some other animal.  It was so very small.  I'm not going to\r\nthink about it.  We'd better go on in our ordinary way without\r\ntroubling; only for Tommy's sake we won't go far from home, for some\r\ndays at any rate.\"\r\n\r\nThey returned with two excellent fish.  Elizabeth at once told Tommy of\r\ntheir idea of a washing-day, and, as she hoped, the young girl was so\r\nmuch amused at the novelty of it, that she forgot her alarms for a\r\ntime.  After breakfast they took off their things and donned their\r\ndressing-gowns, as Tommy called their macintoshes; and having gathered\r\neach a smooth, round stone, laid their linen in the stream at a place\r\nwhere it ran over level rock, and began merrily to pound away.  When\r\nthey had given the clothes a thorough good drubbing, as Tommy worded\r\nit, they laid them on the grass in the sun, and within an hour they\r\nwere quite dry.\r\n\r\n\"My word! don't they look nice?\" cried Tommy in delight.  \"Old\r\nJane--poor old thing--never got them white at home, did she?  We must\r\nhave a weekly wash, girls; it's great fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's another thing we might try,\" said Elizabeth.  \"I haven't got\r\nused to eating fish without salt, yet.  Couldn't we make some by\r\nevaporation?\"\r\n\r\n\"How would you do that?\" asked Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Put some sea-water in our cups, and let it evaporate.  It would soon\r\ndo so in this heat, and leave the salt at the bottom.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm! it sounds all right,\" said Tommy, \"but I doubt whether we should\r\nget enough salt to put on a bird's tail.  Let's try.\"\r\n\r\nThey half filled their three cups from the sea, and put them in the\r\nfull glare of the sun.  Every now and then Tommy ran to them to see hew\r\nthey were getting on, every time becoming more sceptical of success.\r\nThere was still a good deal of water in the cups at nightfall; but, as\r\nMary said, that didn't matter much, as they had used up all their tea,\r\nnone of them liking coffee at night; so they left the cups as they\r\nwere, to evaporate the rest of the water next day.  When the cups were\r\nat last dry there was no appreciable sediment, and Tommy with great\r\nscorn pronounced the experiment a failure.\r\n\r\n\"The cups don't hold enough,\" said Mary.  \"What we want is a large\r\nshallow pan, and as we haven't got one, I'm afraid you'll have to go\r\nwithout salt, Bess.\"\r\n\r\nBut a day or two after, Elizabeth discovered a wide shallow depression\r\nin a rock a little distance above high-water mark.\r\n\r\n\"This will do for a pan,\" she said.  \"We'll fill it with sea-water with\r\nour cups, and keep on filling it up as the water evaporates.  Then\r\nwe'll see, my dears.\"\r\n\r\nThey followed this plan for several days, and at last were able to\r\ncollect a fair quantity of salt.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't table salt, to be sure,\" said Elizabeth, looking at the\r\ndirty-grey powder, \"but it is certainly salt enough for anything, and\r\nthis quantity will last for a week at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are getting quite clever,\" said Mary.  \"I dare say we shall be able\r\nto make quite a lot of things by and by.\"\r\n\r\nDuring these days they had seen no more signs of inhabitants, and their\r\nnervousness partially wore off.  They were still careful, however, not\r\nto stray far beyond the immediate neighbourhood of their camp, and\r\nslept every night in the boat, which they left close to the brink of\r\nthe sea.  They devoted a good deal of time to weaving grass mats for\r\nthe floor of their hut, but had not as yet plucked up courage to spend\r\na night in it.  With the boat as a refuge they felt a certain sense of\r\nsecurity, though they admitted, when they talked about it, that it\r\nwould not really be of any great service if they were attacked; for\r\nthey could only escape by embarking, and then to drift on the sea out\r\nof reach of food was a terrible fate to look forward to.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Mary had been out to gather bananas, she came back with\r\nthe news that she had gathered the very last one, so that they were\r\nfaced with the immediate necessity of finding another food supply.\r\n\r\n\"We must take our courage in both hands,\" said Elizabeth, \"and revisit\r\nthe land of plenty beyond the ridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let's go near the orange-trees,\" said Tommy anxiously.\r\n\"Couldn't we try a little to the left?  There will surely be some fruit\r\nof some sort in other parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why not,\" said Mary.  \"I don't want to go there again,\r\neither, in case you were right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I was right,\" declared Tommy.  \"You aren't going to make out\r\nagain that I can't believe my own eyes!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll try another direction,\" said Elizabeth, anxious to keep the\r\npeace.  \"Let us go northward along the shore.  We have never really\r\nexplored the coast of our island yet.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after breakfast, they set out.  There was a long stretch\r\nof beach strewn with boulders which had apparently fallen from the\r\ncliffs.  These rose higher as they proceeded, and jutted out to within\r\ntwenty or thirty feet of high-water mark.  By and by they reached a\r\npoint where the huge rocky obstacles made further progress impossible.\r\nRetracing their steps, they clambered with some difficulty up the face\r\nof the cliff, and at last gained the high land above.\r\n\r\nAll this time they moved very cautiously, careful to make no more noise\r\nthan they could help, and always on the look-out for danger.  But the\r\nsilence was broken only by the chatter of birds, the warbling of a\r\nblackbird now and then, and the harsh screaming of the parrots in the\r\nwoods, that extended almost to the verge of the cliffs.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to catch and tame one of those beauties,\" said Tommy.\r\n\"Perhaps I might teach him to talk, and that would be a change,\r\nwouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry we bore you,\" said Mary.  \"Wouldn't it be better to find\r\nyour savage and teach him how to keep up an amiable conversation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be sarcastic; it doesn't suit you,\" said Tommy cuttingly, and\r\nagain Elizabeth had to intervene.\r\n\r\n\"We came out to look for food,\" she said smoothly, \"and I think we had\r\nbetter not think of anything else.\"\r\n\r\nMary and Tommy separated, and went off at a little distance by\r\nthemselves, looking among the trees and shrubs for fruits or berries\r\nthat might seem edible.  For a time none of the girls saw anything that\r\nappeared promising, but presently Mary called out quite excitedly--\r\n\r\n\"Here, Bess, I'm sure this is the breadfruit tree.  Come and look.\"\r\n\r\nThen, frightened by the sound of her own voice, she suddenly became\r\naware of her indiscretion, and ran fleetly to join Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"You idiot!\" said Tommy in a fierce whisper, as she came up with the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThey stood listening for a while, wondering whether Mary's exclamation\r\nhad attracted the attention of some inhabitant.  But, reassured by the\r\nabsence of any sign of danger, they hastened to inspect the trees upon\r\nwhich Mary had lighted.  Elizabeth noticed that Tommy, who would have\r\ndied rather than apologize, had slipped her hand into Mary's in token\r\nof regret for her sharp speech.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves in the midst of a little grove of trees, about\r\nthe size of small oaks, but with much sparser foliage.  Peeping out\r\nfrom among the long, indented leaves were several large round fruits\r\nwith a crinkly rind.\r\n\r\n\"I know they are breadfruit,\" said Mary gleefully.  \"Don't you remember\r\nthe pictures in that book of Captain Cook's voyages?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's peel one and see how it tastes,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't like it better than raw dough,\" said Mary.  \"It has to be\r\ncooked first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bother!  You know I don't like cooked fruit.  It isn't a fruit at all\r\nif you can't eat it raw; it's a vegetable.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth smiled at this ingenuous distinction.\r\n\r\n\"Let us take one each and go and try them,\" she suggested.  \"If they\r\nare really anything like bread we shall enjoy them, I know.\"\r\n\r\nLaden with the fruits, they returned to their camp.\r\n\r\n\"Pity the place is so far from home,\" said Mary.  \"We must have come\r\nmore than a mile, I should think.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we are satisfied with our bread we might come again and gather a\r\ngood load that will last some time,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached home they lost no time in stripping off the thin rind\r\nof one of the fruits, and found beneath it a white doughy substance\r\nsomething like new bread.  Tommy could not forbear tasting it, in spite\r\nof what Mary had said.\r\n\r\n\"What horrid, nasty stuff!\" she exclaimed, making a wry face.  \"It's\r\nlike--what is it like?  Taste it, Bess.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth pinched off a very small piece and ate it.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me like sweetened flour with a smack of artichokes,\" she\r\nsaid.  \"I hope it is better cooked; scrape it all out, Mary, while I\r\nget the oven ready.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the pulp was scraped out, Mary kneaded it into a flat cake and cut\r\nit into three equal portions.  Elizabeth put them into the stone oven,\r\nand in about twenty minutes took them out, slightly browned, and\r\nsmelling somewhat of new bread.  Allowing them to cool, the girls each\r\nnibbled a little.\r\n\r\n\"Not half bad,\" said Tommy.  \"I suppose we'll get used to it, and like\r\nit better.  I never liked carrots when I was a child, and I do now.  If\r\nwe only had some butter!  Why aren't there any cocoanuts here, I\r\nwonder?  They have milk, haven't they?  If we had some we might make\r\nsome butter out of the cream.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the other girls laughed outright.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid we shouldn't get much cream out of cocoanuts,\" said\r\nElizabeth.  \"The milk is a sickly kind of juice, isn't it, Mary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I had some once, long ago, when Father took me to the fair at\r\nExeter.  He knocked down the cocoanut at one of the shies.  I didn't\r\nlike the milk at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must eat our bread without butter,\" said Elizabeth.  \"I do hope,\r\nthough, that we shall find more bananas, for I'm sure I shall soon get\r\ntired of the breadfruit.  We must try another part of the island\r\nanother day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA TROPICAL STORM\r\n\r\nTwo or three days passed without incident.  The elder girls in their\r\nheart of hearts were becoming convinced that the footprints must have\r\nbeen those of an animal; but Tommy had shown herself so touchy on that\r\npoint that they never told her what they thought.  With the return of\r\ntheir confidence they began to think that they were punishing\r\nthemselves by neglecting to use the hut, and one night they ventured to\r\nsleep in it for the first time, lying on their grass mats, with pillows\r\nof grass and dried leaves.  They found their new quarters so much more\r\neasy and comfortable that they decided to use the boat no more as a\r\nbedchamber, and thought they had been silly in not deserting it before.\r\n\r\nThe hut was delightfully cool both by day and night.  In the daytime\r\nthey always lifted the awning facing the sea; at night they let it down\r\nat first, getting ventilation by the space beneath the roof; but as\r\nthey became accustomed to their bedroom they left the opening uncovered\r\nat night also.  Before turning in they would sit cross-legged just\r\nwithin the hut, gazing, most often in silence, over the wide expanse of\r\nsea, watching the stars as they came into the darkening sky, and\r\nthinking of their uncle and the friends at home.  Uncle Ben was\r\nscarcely ever mentioned among them now.  They could not bear to think\r\nthat the dear old man was at the bottom of the sea, that could show\r\nsuch a smooth and smiling face, and yet behave like a treacherous,\r\ncruel monster.  They scarcely ever dared to think of the future, for\r\nthough they seldom missed a visit to the cliffs, from which they could\r\nlook far over the sea, and though their flag was still flying from the\r\ntree, they had almost lost hope of being rescued, and could only live\r\nfrom day to day, killing thought by various little activities.\r\n\r\nOne day, for instance, Elizabeth suggested that as their hut was built\r\nand furnished, and they had little to do except fish and prepare their\r\nfood, they might make themselves some new hats.  The idea was eagerly\r\ntaken up by the others.  Each girl worked in her own way, plaiting\r\nlengths of thin grass, and Mary hit on a brilliant notion of making\r\nbrims out of the large leaves from a kind of dwarf palm that grew\r\nplentifully in the neighbourhood.  They fastened these together, and\r\nthen to the grass crowns, by threading them in and out with the very\r\nfine tendrils of a creeper.  When the hats were finished the girls had\r\nwhat Tommy called a mutual admiration meeting, and felt very proud of\r\ntheir Dolly Vardens.\r\n\r\nA few days after the discovery of the breadfruit, they made a lengthy\r\nexcursion along the southern shore.  Here the woods were a good deal\r\ndenser than in other parts, which was one reason why they had hesitated\r\nto explore them.  But the cliffs were much less lofty than those on the\r\nnorth, and the girls easily climbed them, and penetrated for a short\r\ndistance into the fringing woods.\r\n\r\nThey discovered several trees of kinds they had not seen before.  There\r\nwas one in particular that interested them by its fantastic shape; it\r\nwas so odd-looking that Tommy dubbed it the clown of the forest; the\r\nreal name, of which they were ignorant, was the pandanus.  But the\r\nspecial reward of this expedition was the discovery of a thick\r\nplantation of bananas and oranges, quite equal to those they had seen\r\non the dreaded eastern side of the ridge.  They rushed upon the oranges\r\nthat bestrewed the ground, devoured several, and filled their pockets\r\nwith them.  What with fish--they were expert fishers by this time--the\r\nbreadfruit, and this fresh storehouse, they felt no more anxiety about\r\nfood, and if only they could have lost their fear of possible wild\r\nneighbours they would have had nothing to trouble the serenity of their\r\nhealthy life.  But none of them was as yet ready to tempt fate again by\r\ncrossing the ridge, and Elizabeth at any rate knew that while the\r\ngreater part of the island was shut to them, they could never be quite\r\neasy in mind.  She felt that the uncertainty was even harder to bear\r\nthan knowledge would have been.\r\n\r\nOne day their peaceful existence was rudely disturbed, not by man, but\r\nby nature.  The island was visited by a storm of quite extraordinary\r\nviolence.  The air had been for some time very oppressive, and the\r\ngirls, feeling incapable of any exertion, were resting in the hut, when\r\nthere came a sudden hot blast of wind straight in from the sea.  They\r\nlooked out.  Vast lurid clouds were piling up; in a few seconds, it\r\nseemed, the sky became black, and huge waves broke over the reef,\r\nsending up mountains of spray.  The wind tore through the woods,\r\nincreasing every moment in fury.  One terrible blast ripped the slight\r\nhut to fragments, and the girls had no sooner extricated themselves\r\nfrom the heap of tattered mats and broken canes that covered them, than\r\na flood of rain poured upon them.  They rushed away to the lee-side of\r\na hillock, trying in vain to find shelter from the storm, and cowering\r\nin terror as they heard peals of thunder, and then a tremendous crash\r\nas the tempest uprooted some great tree and dashed it to the ground.\r\n\r\nMary was always terror-stricken in a thunderstorm, and she clung\r\nhalf-fainting to Elizabeth, who clasped her close in a motherly\r\nembrace.  Tommy, on the other hand, was perfectly fearless.  She gazed\r\nat the boiling sea, and watched the lightning with a sort of fascinated\r\nadmiration.  She was almost sorry when the storm blew itself out after\r\ntwo hours of fury, and the sky cleared as rapidly as it had darkened.\r\n\r\n\"How lovely!\" she said, dripping wet as she was.  \"Poor old Mary!\"\r\n\r\nMary, indeed, was quite overcome, and it was some time before she was\r\nable to walk away.  The tempest had left ruin in its track.\r\n\r\n\"The boat!\" cried Elizabeth, suddenly remembering the little vessel,\r\nwhich, though it had been drawn up higher than when they slept in it,\r\nshe feared might have been washed away.  \"We must leave you for a\r\nlittle, Mary.  Walk about if you can, and let the sun dry your things.\"\r\n\r\nThen she raced down to the shore with Tommy, and was horrified to\r\ndiscover that the boat had disappeared.  The girls scanned the sea,\r\nwhich was still rough, but there was not a sign of it.  They ran along\r\nthe beach northward, hoping that the boat might have been cast up, and\r\nwere rejoiced to find it about a quarter of a mile away, bottom upwards\r\non a spit of sand.  It was some distance from the sea, which, though it\r\nhad evidently come much higher than usual, had now receded to within a\r\nlittle of high-water mark.  The girls managed to right the boat, only\r\nto find, of course, that the oars were missing.\r\n\r\n\"How silly we were not to bring the oars into the hut along with the\r\nboat-hook!\" cried Elizabeth.  \"The boat is perfectly useless without\r\nthe oars, and we can't make new ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the tide will wash them up,\" said Tommy.  \"Help me up this\r\nrock, Bess; I'll see if they are in sight.\"\r\n\r\nMounted on the rock she scanned the surface, and after a time saw\r\nsomething bobbing up and down about a hundred yards out, and some way\r\nto the south of where she stood.\r\n\r\n\"There it is, I believe,\" she cried.  \"The sea is getting calmer now;\r\nshall I swim out for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't think of it,\" said Elizabeth.  \"I dare say the sea is full\r\nof sharks.  I saw a fin yesterday when we were fishing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you didn't tell me!  I should love to see a real live shark.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth smiled inwardly at this.\r\n\r\n\"But we must get the oar somehow, Bess.  One would be better than\r\nnothing.  And quickly, too.  See, the tide is running out fast.  And if\r\nthe oar gets into the current that flows past the reef, it is good-bye\r\nfor ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how we can.  We haven't a paddle of any kind.  The\r\nboat-hook's no good.  Wait, though; I wonder if we could get a branch\r\nof a tree.  Stay here and keep the oar in sight while I run and look.\"\r\n\r\nShe ran up the cliff-side, which was covered with vegetation.  The\r\nsmall trees had withstood the storm better than the large ones.  Some\r\nwere cracked and broken, but others had merely bent to the blast, while\r\nthe ground was strewn with the more massive trunks, and with\r\ninnumerable small branches and twigs.  In a little while she came to a\r\ntree that had two boughs forming a fork, in shape like a boy's\r\ncatapult.  Catching hold of this, and straining upon it, Elizabeth\r\nmanaged to break it off; it had occurred to her that the fork might\r\nform the skeleton of a paddle.  But time was too precious for her to\r\nattempt to make it by herself alone, so she ran with it to Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Mary,\" she cried.  \"Pull yourself together.  We have found the\r\nboat, but the oars are gone, and one is floating out to sea.  Help me\r\nto make a paddle, so that we can go after it.  Get some creepers and\r\nsome leaves as quickly as you can.  I'll show you what I mean.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of material close at hand, and they were soon busily\r\nat work making a sort of criss-cross lattice-work upon the fork, which\r\nthey notched at intervals with their knives, to give holding to the\r\ntendrils.  Having rapidly made their framework, they laid the leaves on\r\nit, and bound these on with more creepers.  Before they had finished it\r\nas Elizabeth would have liked, they heard Tommy's shrill voice calling--\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Bess, the oar's going out fast.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth jumped up, carrying the odd-looking paddle, which Tommy said\r\nwas like a lacrosse stick.  The oar was now out of sight, though Tommy\r\ncould point to the spot where she saw it last.  They launched the boat,\r\nand using the paddle as a stern-oar, Tommy employed all the skill she\r\nhad gained by paddling the dinghy to and from the shore at Southampton.\r\nThe paddle was a very poor thing; it bent a good deal, and some of the\r\ntendrils became loose, and hung about it like the string of an old\r\ncricket bat.  But there was no time to stop and repair it, or the oar,\r\nwhich they now saw clearly, would drift past the reef and utterly\r\nbeyond reach.\r\n\r\nElizabeth began to grow a little anxious in case they should find\r\nthemselves adrift by and by with nothing better than the makeshift\r\npaddle, which would certainly not last more than a very short time.\r\nThat would be a calamity indeed, for they might be carried far out to\r\nsea, and there was Mary alone on the island.  But Tommy was working so\r\nenergetically that the distance between the boat and the oar was fast\r\nlessening, and Elizabeth, raising herself in her seat, suddenly caught\r\nsight of the second oar not far beyond the first.\r\n\r\n\"Let me take your place, Tommy,\" she said.  \"You must be tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit.  Besides, we'll lose time if we change, and perhaps upset.\r\nStay where you are, Bess; I'll get that oar in a minute, and then we'll\r\nsoon have the other one.\"\r\n\r\nA few more strokes brought the boat within reach of the oar, and\r\nElizabeth, bending over, drew it up.  Then Tommy left the stern and\r\nboth sat on the thwarts, pulling towards the second oar, which they\r\novertook in a few seconds.\r\n\r\n\"We'll keep the paddle as a memento,\" said Elizabeth.  \"But look!  What\r\na terrible distance we are from the shore!  Mary will be half frantic.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's lucky that we are inside the reef,\" said Tommy.  \"Already I can\r\nfeel the current quite strong.  We shall have to pull hard to get out\r\nof it!\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Tommy was rather tired, but she would not give in.  It was\r\na long pull back, and at first it seemed impossible to draw the boat\r\nout of the current that was rapidly bearing it northward.  But having\r\nnow two good oars, they succeeded presently in getting back into calmer\r\nwater.  Then, turning the boat's head southward, they rowed more gently\r\nalong the shore, and at last reached their own little harbour, where\r\nMary was awaiting them.\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ thankful you have got back safely,\" she cried.  \"When I saw you\r\ngoing so far I nearly went mad for fear you couldn't return.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must take care it never happens again,\" said Elizabeth.  \"We'll\r\ndrag the boat up much higher this time, and if we tie the painter to a\r\nrock, or to a tree if there's one near enough, we needn't be anxious,\r\nand we'll certainly keep the oars in the hut.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dears, we haven't a hut,\" said Tommy.  \"We be three poor\r\nmariners--vagabonds, homeless, ragged and tanned.  Who was that old\r\nking who sat himself down in a lonely mood to think, and watched a\r\nspider spin its web over and over again, and thought he couldn't let a\r\nspider beat him and at last beat all his enemies?  Oh, dear, that's\r\nmade me out of breath.  Robert Bruce, wasn't it, Mary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; Mrs. Hemans wrote the poem.  'Bruce and the Spider,' it's called.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care who wrote it, only we've got to spin our web again.  Oh,\r\n'Will you walk into my parlour?' said the spider to the fly.  'Please\r\n'm, where's the parlour?' says the fly.  There, I'm a lunatic, but I\r\nfeel so jolly at having caught those runaway oars.  I say, are you dry?\r\nI am.  That's one advantage of living in a tropical climate; if you get\r\nsoaked you don't have to shiver while your things are dried at the\r\nfire.  'Homeless, ragged and tanned, who so contented as I?'\" she sang,\r\nand Elizabeth, noticing the high spirits of her wild young sister,\r\nhoped that there wouldn't be a reaction, and that Tommy was not going\r\nto be ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nALARMS AND DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\nContemplating the ruins of the hut they had built up with so much care,\r\nthe girls felt a very natural chagrin.  You have seen a child who has\r\nerected a fine house of bricks fly into a rage when the structure\r\ntopples by its own weight, or at least look utterly woebegone, and\r\nleave the scattered bricks lying where they fell.  Elizabeth Westmacott\r\nand her sisters felt very much the same disinclination to begin again.\r\nThe site was a picture of disorder.  Portions of the matting had been\r\nblown right away; other portions in shreds and tatters had found\r\nresting-places among the foliage of the surrounding trees and shrubs.\r\nSome of the canes of the roof dangled from the boughs, others littered\r\nthe ground amid a tangle of creepers and leafage.  No one could have\r\nsupposed that only a few hours before the same place had been a model\r\nof neatness.\r\n\r\n\"It will take an age to tidy up,\" grumbled Tommy.  \"Is it worth while\r\nto bother about a hut again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like being without a roof over our heads,\" replied Elizabeth;\r\n\"but we won't start yet if you don't feel inclined.  Let us go and take\r\na look round.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall want some breadfruit for dinner,\" said Mary, \"so we had\r\nbetter go that way.  I dare say we shall find all we need on the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\nThey set off towards the breadfruit-trees.  Everywhere there were signs\r\nof the violence of the storm, but they were surprised and interested to\r\nnotice that the worst havoc had been wrought in almost a straight line\r\nacross the island from south-west to north-east.\r\n\r\nIt was as though some huge giant had gone steadily forward wielding a\r\nmonstrous scythe.  The tornado had cut a clean path through the forest,\r\nleaving scarcely a tree standing over a wide space.  Where there had\r\nbeen close, unbroken woodland was now a bare avenue, interrupted by the\r\ntrunks of trees that had been thrown this way and that.  Impressed as\r\nthe girls had been with the fury of the tornado during the time of\r\ntheir exposure to it, its devastating power was brought home to them\r\nnow much more strongly.  They looked with awe upon its ravages.\r\n\r\n\"How thankful we ought to be that we were not in its direct path!\" said\r\nElizabeth.  \"A little more to right or left and we should have had\r\ntrees crashing down upon us; we might have all been killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a dreadful place,\" said Tommy, subdued and thoughtful.  \"Oh,\r\nBess, shall we never be found and taken away?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must hope on, dear.  It will never do to get downhearted.  While we\r\nare all well and strong we need not mind so very much, and a ship is\r\nsure to come this way some time or other.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it might pass us,\" said Mary.  \"I am sure our flag is blown away.\r\nShall we go and see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't we better fetch our breadfruit first, now we are in this\r\ndirection?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course.  We shall have to light another fire, too; ours is sure to\r\nbe out.\"\r\n\r\nThey went on, and on arriving at the breadfruit plantation found, as\r\nthey had expected, that the ground was littered with fruit, which was\r\nalready being devoured by land-crabs, insects and birds.  They picked\r\nup several that were in good condition, and retraced their steps\r\ntowards the shore.\r\n\r\nAs they were passing through the fringe of woodland, Tommy stopped\r\nsuddenly, and went down on her knees.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do look!\" she cried.  \"Here's a nest on the ground, and the\r\ndearest little white parrot you ever saw.  Poor little thing!  I think\r\nit has lost its mother.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls stooped to look at it, and Tommy put her hand into the nest.\r\nThe tiny bird rustled in alarm, opening its beak to let out a plaintive\r\ncry; but it was too young to use its wings, and Tommy took it up and\r\nheld it gently.\r\n\r\n\"Its little heart is beating frantically,\" she said.  \"Let us take it\r\nback with us and try to rear it.  You know I wanted one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think we can rear it?\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"It will starve if we leave it,\" replied Tommy.  \"I shall love to try.\"\r\n\r\nThe others agreed that there was no harm in trying, so Tommy carried it\r\ncarefully back with her, now and then stroking the ruffled feathers.\r\nWhen they got to their camp she laid the bird on a bed of grass, peeled\r\none of the breadfruits, and held a few crumbs of the pulp in the palm\r\nof her hand just below the parrot's beak.  But it was too young, or\r\nperhaps too frightened, even to feed itself, and it would have fared\r\nill had not its captor been a country girl and known how to deal with\r\nsuch an emergency.  She had seen young birds fed by hand, and she at\r\nonce cut a thin stick and sharpened its end, upon which she stuck a\r\nlittle bit of breadfruit.  Then holding the bird in her left hand, she\r\nwaited until it opened its beak to cry, and quickly slipped the food\r\nin.  The little bird swallowed it greedily, much to Tommy's delight,\r\nand she went on feeding it until Elizabeth suggested that she would\r\nkill it with excess.\r\n\r\n\"The poor thing was hungry,\" said Tommy.  \"It's not nearly so much\r\nalarmed now.  I shall keep it for a pet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to clip its wings, then,\" said Mary, \"or it is sure to fly\r\naway as soon as it is strong enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do it, Mary.  Be very gentle, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no need yet, perhaps,\" suggested Elizabeth.  \"Do it in a day\r\nor two when it has got over its fright.  It would be just as well to\r\nput it in the boat while we are busy.  You must take care not to\r\noverfeed it, Tommy.\"\r\n\r\nAfter dinner they went first to the flag-staff.  Not a shred of their\r\nscarves was left.  As they had no material for making another flag,\r\nexcept their handkerchiefs, which they did not care to part with, and\r\ntheir wraps, which they could not spare, they had to give up for the\r\nmoment any idea of erecting a signal.  Then they hastened in the\r\nopposite direction, southward, to fetch bananas and oranges for the\r\nother meals of the day.  A grave disappointment awaited them.  There\r\nwas plenty of fruit on the ground, but the trees themselves, standing\r\nin the direct path of the storm, had all been uprooted or broken off,\r\nso that when they had used their present supply they could obtain no\r\nmore at this spot.  It would be necessary to go once more in search of\r\nfood, for they found the breadfruit too insipid to form their only\r\nvegetable diet.  They knew the district between their camp and the\r\nruined plantation; nothing edible was to be had there.  The only other\r\nplace where they knew that fruit existed was to the east, beyond the\r\nridge; and even now they could not make up their minds to revisit the\r\nscene of their scare.\r\n\r\nNext day, however, when Tommy had fed her bird and Mary had clipped its\r\nwings, and they had spent an hour or so tidying up the site of the hut\r\npreparatory to rebuilding, they set off again in a southerly direction,\r\nhaving resolved to extend their exploration within easy distance of the\r\nshore.  Crossing the broad path of uprooted trees, flattened grass, and\r\ntorn undergrowth, they found as they proceeded that the ridge hemmed\r\nthem in, closer and closer to the sea.  This was partly due to the\r\ncurving of the shore, and partly to the diagonal lie of the rising\r\nground.  Little foothills of the ridge extended downwards towards the\r\ncoast, forming ridges in miniature, cut here and there by streamlets.\r\n\r\nOn such expeditions Tommy almost always led the way, for her restless\r\nand active temperament was impatient of the sedater going of her\r\nsisters.  But she never went far ahead, and every few minutes, as if\r\nalarmed at her own daring, she would run back and keep with the others\r\nfor a time.  She was thus a few yards in advance when, as she mounted a\r\nhillock, she came in sight of a number of trees clustering almost at\r\nthe edge of the sea, and uttered an exclamation of surprise and\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do look here!\" she cried.  \"I believe we have come to some\r\ncocoanut palms.  You remember we saw some at Valparaiso.\"\r\n\r\nThe others ran to join her, and Mary at once declared that she was\r\nright.  There was no mistaking the tall, smooth stems with their\r\nfeathery crowns.  They all rushed forward eagerly.  Thanks to the\r\nstorm, there were several huge nuts strewing the ground around each of\r\nthe trees.  Tommy, who was first on the scene, picked up one of them\r\nand turned it over in her hands in a puzzled way.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a cocoanut after all?\" she said.  \"It's not a bit like those I\r\nhave seen in shops.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a cocoanut right enough,\" replied Mary.  \"But you've got to strip\r\noff the outer husk before you come to the nut itself.\"\r\n\r\nTommy whipped out her knife and began to cut away the coarse, fibrous\r\ncovering.  It was very tough, and she soon declared that it would never\r\ncome off unless the others helped her.  So they all knelt on the ground\r\nwith the nut in the middle, and employed their knives energetically,\r\nuntil at last the husk was removed.  The shell inside was ivory-white,\r\nvery different from the old brown nuts they had been used to see in\r\nEngland.  Being quite brittle, a small piece was easily cut off the\r\ntop, and they saw the inside full of a pale, milky liquid.\r\n\r\n\"You first, Tommy,\" said Elizabeth.  \"You saw the trees first.\"\r\n\r\nTommy took a sip of the liquid.\r\n\r\n\"Delicious!\" she said.  \"I don't think I ever tasted anything so nice.\"\r\n\r\nShe drank more, and, handing the nut to Mary, continued--\r\n\r\n\"It's sweet, Bess, and sour too, something like lemonade, only not like\r\nit.  It's like--oh, I don't know what it's like; just itself, I\r\nsuppose.  Don't drink it all, Mary.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth, when her turn came, pronounced it a very refreshing drink,\r\nand they were all delighted at so welcome an addition to their larder.\r\nThey collected as many nuts as they could carry, and, returning to\r\ntheir camp, stored them in the boat.  In the course of the next few\r\ndays they went several times to the same place, until they had brought\r\nback all the nuts that lay on the ground.  It was fortunate that so\r\nmany had been thrown down, for they did not see how they could have\r\nobtained them otherwise.  Even Tommy, the climber of the family,\r\nconfessed that she would have been beaten by the smooth, straight stem\r\nof the cocoanut palm.  Mary had a dim recollection of reading that the\r\nnatives had a way of climbing the trees by means of a rope, but she\r\ncould not remember the details of the method, and in any case, Tommy\r\ncould hardly have used it successfully without a good deal of practice.\r\n\r\nOnce more relieved from anxiety about food, the girls devoted\r\nthemselves industriously to the reconstruction of their hut.  Their\r\nformer practice made their task easier.  In a few days the new house\r\nwas finished, and they were especially glad of its shelter at night,\r\ninstead of the cramping narrowness of the boat.\r\n\r\nDays had lengthened into weeks.  The notches on their calendar trunk\r\ntold them how time was flying--a sad reminder in many ways.  With so\r\nlittle to do they felt the hours hang heavily on their hands, though\r\nTommy's parrot gave them a little amusement and interest.  The bird had\r\nbecome quite used to its mistress, and had learnt to take its food from\r\nher hand.  Its voice, not of very charming quality, as all confessed,\r\ngrew stronger, and it became accustomed to give a quaint little scream\r\nwhenever Tommy approached.  She would set it on her finger and talk to\r\nit, using the same word over and over again, in the hope that it would\r\nby and by pick up a phrase or two.  But although it became perfectly\r\ntame, it could never be induced to substitute civilized words for its\r\nnatural scream and squawk.\r\n\r\n\"You little silly-billy!\" cried Tommy one day, after an hour's patient\r\ninstruction.  \"What's the good of you for a pet?  There!  Perch on my\r\nshoulder, and don't make such an idiotic noise, for goodness' sake.\"\r\n\r\nTommy at last gave up the attempt in despair; but she became very fond\r\nof the bird, and declared that when they were rescued she would\r\ncertainly take it home with her.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful how the hope of rescue never died.  When each day\r\nended without the sight of the longed-for vessel, they would say,\r\n\"Never mind, perhaps it will come to-morrow.\"  And when to-morrow had\r\nthe same disappointment, there was still to-morrow.  So they lived from\r\nday to day, veering from hope to despondency, and from despondency to\r\nhope again.\r\n\r\nThey had almost forgotten Tommy's fright.  Surely, they thought, they\r\nmust have seen some one by this time if the island was inhabited.  Yet\r\nthere was the same misgiving, the same disinclination to cross the\r\nridge.  Elizabeth laughed at herself, and more than once said she\r\nreally must break through her reluctance.  But it ended there.  Her\r\nheart failed her when it came to the point.\r\n\r\nEasy though their life was, it had its discomforts.  The breadfruit\r\ngave out, and having found no more oranges or bananas, they grew very\r\ntired of a diet of fish and cocoanuts.  They had seen other fruits, and\r\nshrubs bearing berries that looked very enticing, but the fear of\r\npoison deterred them from trying anything that they did not know.\r\n\r\nThe want of a change of clothes, too, was a trouble to them, and their\r\nboots had become unwearable.  They had often been soaked in sea-water,\r\nand then, drying in the sun, had cracked and become worse than useless.\r\nThey got into the habit of going barefoot, except when they set out for\r\na long walk.  In the hut, and when walking on the grass, they were\r\ncomfortable enough, but on rough ground they suffered a good deal at\r\nfirst.  In course of time, however, helped by frequent soaking in\r\nsea-water, their feet became hardened, and they felt no inconvenience\r\nin going about unshod.\r\n\r\nThey had more than once noticed some very small bees, hardly larger\r\nthan houseflies, flitting among the flowers.  One day Elizabeth\r\nsuggested that they should try to find out whether these Polynesian\r\nbees made honey, and if so, where it was.  Tommy hailed the suggestion,\r\nand started at once to track the bees to their nests.  For a long time\r\nshe had no success.  Only after many days did she, almost by accident,\r\nlight upon a bees'-nest in a hole in the trunk of a tree.  Informing\r\nher sisters of the discovery, she proposed that they should smoke the\r\nbees out.\r\n\r\nThey kindled a small fire at the base of the tree, immediately beneath\r\nthe hole.  When they thought they had allowed plenty of time for the\r\nsmoke to stupefy the bees, they put on their macintoshes, pulling the\r\nhoods well down over their heads, and prepared to rifle the hole.  It\r\nwas so small that a hand could scarcely pass through it, and Mary\r\nsuggested that they should enlarge it, so that they might see what they\r\nwere doing.  Accordingly they stripped off the bark round the hole,\r\nuntil it was much more capacious.  Unluckily, the inrush of fresh air\r\nappeared to revive the little inhabitants, which darted out with fierce\r\nbuzzings, putting the robbers to utter rout.  They ran off with their\r\nheads down, waving their arms wildly to beat off the furious insects.\r\nTommy got off scot free, but Elizabeth and Mary were stung slightly,\r\nand but for the smoking, which had not been wholly ineffectual, the\r\nbees would probably have hurt them severely.\r\n\r\n\"We won't be beaten by a parcel of silly bees,\" said Tommy, as they\r\nwent home.  \"You aren't much hurt, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel a burning spot in my cheek,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"And one of my fingers is swelling,\" added Mary.\r\n\r\n\"As we haven't any ointment, or anything, you'll just have to get well\r\nby yourselves,\" remarked Tommy.  \"You'll have another try, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!  We'll give them a larger dose next time,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\"I think we ought to have some reward for our enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nA day or two afterwards they visited the hole again.  By means of a\r\nlarger fire, fed with leaves that gave off a very pungent smoke, they\r\nmanaged to stupefy the bees thoroughly.  When they examined the hole\r\nthey were surprised to find, not large combs, as in an English hive,\r\nbut a collection of bags of brown wax, about the size of a walnut,\r\nunited in a regular mass.\r\n\r\n\"Fancy bees having foreign ways!\" said Tommy.  \"I should have thought\r\nthat bees were the same all the world over.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why bees shouldn't be different, like people,\" said Mary.\r\n\"They're very intelligent.\"\r\n\r\nThe others laughed at this curious reason for differences of habit.\r\nThe honey, they found, was more fluid than they were accustomed to in\r\nEngland, and in taste and smell it was slightly scented.  They took a\r\ngood quantity home with them, but it did not go very well with fish,\r\nand even with cocoanuts it was a doubtful joy.\r\n\r\n\"If we only had some breadfruit, or even bananas, we should like it\r\nbetter,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"We can only get those by going across the ridge again,\" said\r\nElizabeth.  \"Shall we venture?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" said Tommy decidedly.  \"I'm not going to be scared out of my\r\nwits for anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go with you, Bess,\" said Mary, after a little hesitation.  \"It\r\nreally is silly to be afraid of nothing.\"\r\n\r\nBut, as it turned out, the first of the three to brave the peril was,\r\nafter all, Tommy herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nLOST\r\n\r\nThat night, for the first time in their residence on the island, the\r\ngirls were awakened by a patter of rain.  Only once before had rain\r\nfallen, and that was during the tornado.  Now the sound of it upon the\r\nthatch of the hut was very slight, but the girls slept so lightly that\r\na whisper was almost enough to disturb them.\r\n\r\n\"I hope we are not in for another smash up,\" said Elizabeth, finding\r\nthat her sisters were both awake.\r\n\r\n\"There's no wind at present,\" returned Mary.  \"Rain alone won't hurt\r\nus.  I expect it's the rainy season beginning, and we shall have weeks\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How disgusting!\" exclaimed Tommy.  \"I always hated having to stay\r\nindoors, and it will be worse than ever here, with no cosy fire and\r\nnice story-book.  What's the time, Bess?\"\r\n\r\nShe leant over towards Elizabeth, who lay next to her, and showed a\r\nlight with her match-lighter.  Elizabeth looked at her watch, which she\r\nnever forgot to wind.\r\n\r\n\"It's about four o'clock,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Time for another snooze before daylight,\" said Tommy, snuggling down\r\nagain into her wraps.  In a minute or two she was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThe other girls remained wide awake, and talked quietly together.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we knew our whereabouts better,\" said Elizabeth.  \"If we only\r\nknew what those islands are that we have seen in the distance, we might\r\nperhaps row to one of them and find friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; of course there are missionaries,\" said Mary.  \"Don't you\r\nremember Uncle Ben told us of a friend of his who was returning to his\r\nstation?  What was his name, Bess?\"\r\n\r\n\"I forget.  We can't venture across the sea, can we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!  There are thousands of islands, and I believe some have never\r\nbeen visited by white people at all.  We might land among cannibals!\"\r\n\r\n\"We are certainly better off here.  I can't believe there are any\r\npeople on this island, in spite of Tommy, or why haven't we seen\r\nsomething of them?  We'll go to the ridge after breakfast, as we said,\r\nand settle the matter once for all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Supposing there _are_ people?\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"As I said before, I think we ought to try and make friends with them,\r\nand if they seem inclined to be unfriendly, perhaps we could make them\r\nafraid of us.  Tommy's match-lighter would startle them, wouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It might, but I don't like to think of having to rely on that sort of\r\nthing for our safety.  They would soon find out our real weakness, and\r\nthen----  Oh!  I do hope we shall not see anybody.  We should be so\r\nmuch more uncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy's birthday is somewhere about now.  We can't be quite sure of\r\nthe date, because we didn't begin to cut notches at once; but we should\r\nbe right within a day or two.  The present she would like best would be\r\nsome oranges from beyond the ridge, and certain news that the island is\r\nuninhabited.\"\r\n\r\n\"How strange it seems to hope that there are no human beings near us!\r\nDo you know, Bess, I think the people of these islands must be very\r\nmelancholy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should you think that?  I have always supposed them to be a happy,\r\nlight-hearted folk, with not a care in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they have nothing to do.  Their food grows for them without work,\r\nand they don't need many clothes.  They've no books to read, no\r\namusements----\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what amusements can they have?  Isn't it only civilized people\r\nwho play games?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.  I seem to remember that even savages gamble, if that is\r\namusement; it wouldn't be to me if I lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you're no sport, Bess,\" said Tommy, who had awakened and caught\r\nthe last few words.  \"It's the excitement they like, whether they win\r\nor lose.  I should be a dreadful gambler, I know, if I had the chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I hope you will never have it, dear,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It is an\r\nunhealthy excitement, I am sure.  We were talking about your birthday,\r\nTommy.  It might be yesterday, to-day, or to-morrow, but you are\r\nfourteen.  We'll wish you many happy returns now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wish you hadn't reminded me,\" cried Tommy.  \"Think of being\r\nfifteen and sixteen, and twenty, and getting old on this island!  I\r\ndon't want to grow old at all, and it would be dreadful here.  I'd be a\r\nscullery maid, or a beggar girl--anything in England, rather than stay\r\nhere.  Shall we ever get away?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Tommy nestled to Elizabeth's side, and as she lay encompassed by\r\nher elder sister's arms she prayed with all her heart that God would\r\nsend help to them soon.\r\n\r\nWhen dawn broke and they got up, it was a dreary world upon which they\r\nlooked.  Sea and earth were covered with a clinging mist.  A drizzle\r\nwas falling.  Everything was sodden and forlorn.  The fire was out, and\r\nthere were no dry sticks for re-lighting it.  They had to content\r\nthemselves with a breakfast of cocoanuts, and then they sat inside the\r\nhut, too much depressed in spirit to go out, or do anything but watch\r\nthe rain.\r\n\r\nPresently the drizzle became a downpour, which, went on for an hour or\r\ntwo, then suddenly ceased, the sun bursting through the leaden sky.\r\nThey took advantage of this to gather a quantity of twigs, which they\r\ncarried into the hut to dry there.  Elizabeth had just suggested that\r\nMary and she should start on their expedition to the ridge, when a\r\nsharp shower drove them again to shelter.  So it went on all day--heavy\r\nshowers that lasted for a few minutes alternating with brief, bright\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that the rainy season had begun.  The girls were\r\npractically confined to the hut for many days in succession, only\r\nsallying forth to catch fish, which they cooked at a new stove built\r\nnearer the hut.  The showers were sometimes light, sometimes very\r\nheavy, and at last the rain began to drip through the thatched roof,\r\nand the girls had to sit in their macintoshes.  Though the sun appeared\r\nevery now and then, it did not shine long enough to dry the ground\r\nbefore another downpour soaked it.  They all became very low-spirited,\r\nand could not find any occupation to pass away the time, for even\r\nweaving was impossible with the sodden grass.\r\n\r\nTheir troubles came to a climax one day when Mary complained of a\r\nracking headache.  Feeling her hot brow, Elizabeth feared she had taken\r\na fever, no doubt owing to the exhalation from the damp earth working\r\non a lowered system.  She and Tommy felt much concern, which became\r\nreal alarm when they found Mary rapidly becoming worse.  She could not\r\neat, and lay on her mat bed covered with the macintoshes and wraps of\r\nthe other girls, her cheeks flushed, her eyes bright and glassy.\r\nTowards evening, when Elizabeth had left the hut to fetch water for the\r\nnight, and Tommy sat by the invalid, she was startled to hear Mary\r\ntalking in a very strange way.\r\n\r\n\"No milk to-day--there's something wrong with Dapple--Jane, Uncle Ben's\r\ncoming to-morrow.  Don't forget the----\"  Then her voice died away into\r\nan indistinguishable muttering.  Presently Tommy caught more phrases:\r\n\"Oh, no, no!  They'll eat us: don't let Tommy go.  Bess!  Bess! they're\r\ncoming after me!--Dan will carry the luggage, Uncle!\"\r\n\r\nSo she raved on, in her delirium babbling about the farm, the ship, her\r\nfriends, a word every now and again showing how much the fear of\r\ncannibals had occupied the background of her mind.  Tommy was\r\nterrified.  She had never seen any one delirious except her father just\r\nbefore he died, and she was smitten with an agonizing fear that Mary\r\nwould not recover.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bess, she's out of her mind!\" she cried piteously, as Elizabeth\r\nreturned.  \"What shall we do?\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth went quickly to the bed, dipped a handkerchief in the water\r\nshe had brought, and laid it on Mary's fevered head.\r\n\r\n\"We must sit up with her to-night,\" she said.  \"Don't give way, Tommy\r\ndear.  She will soon be better.  The fever came on so suddenly that I\r\nam sure it is one of those sharp attacks that don't last long.  But it\r\nwill leave her very weak, and we must be very careful of her.  I do so\r\nwish we had some oranges; the juice is so cooling.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was too late to think of looking for oranges, and they had to be\r\nsatisfied with water and cocoanut milk, which they gave Mary in sips.\r\nAll night long they remained at her side, watching her with distress as\r\nher teeth chattered as if with cold, and then next moment she tossed\r\nabout on her little mat bed, and flung the macintoshes off as if she\r\ncould not bear the heat.  Elizabeth tried to induce Tommy to lie down\r\nfor a little, but the young girl refused, saying that she could not\r\nrest until she knew that Mary was better.\r\n\r\n\"I will get some oranges to-morrow,\" said Elizabeth.  \"I am sure they\r\nwill do her good.\"\r\n\r\nTowards morning Mary dropped off to sleep, and then Tommy was persuaded\r\nto lie down.  The sun had risen when she awoke to find Elizabeth still\r\nwatching over her sleeping sister.\r\n\r\n\"I'll just run down to the stream and bathe my face,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\"She is still asleep.  Give her a little water if she wakes; I shan't\r\nbe long.  Luckily, it's a fine morning.\"\r\n\r\nShe returned in a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Now you run down and wash, Tommy,\" she said; \"it'll freshen you.  I've\r\nput in some fish to bake for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nTommy rose and left the hut.  During Elizabeth's absence she had strung\r\nherself up to a great resolution.  Mary must have oranges, but the one\r\nto fetch them should not be Elizabeth.  She was so calm and steady and\r\ncapable that she would do far better to stay and look after Mary.  \"I\r\ncan be best spared,\" thought Tommy, \"but I know Bess won't let me go if\r\nI propose it.  I shall just do it without telling her.  It won't take\r\nlong to scamper to the orange grove and back again.\"\r\n\r\nShe had not forgotten her former fright; but she told herself that\r\nperhaps she might get to the oranges without being observed, and she\r\nwas ready to do anything for Mary, of whom she was very fond, though\r\nthey sparred sometimes.  So, after bathing her face in the stream, she\r\nwent to the stove and scratched on the sand in front of it with her\r\nknife the words, \"Gone to the orange grove.\"  Then, without waiting,\r\nfor fear her courage failed, she ran swiftly along the bank of the\r\nstream, munching a piece of cocoanut as she went.\r\n\r\nIn the hut Mary had awakened perfectly sensible, and wondering why she\r\nfelt so weak.  Elizabeth bathed her face and hands, smoothed her hair,\r\nand having tried to make her a little more comfortable, gave her a\r\ndrink of cocoanut milk.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with me, Bess?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"You've had a touch of fever.  You'll soon be all right again.  I'm\r\ngoing to get you some oranges presently.  You will enjoy them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I shall.  Have I been ill long?  I feel as weak as anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only one night, dear.  We shall have to feed you up.  You ought to\r\nhave beef tea or chicken broth, of course; but we shall have to do the\r\nbest we can.  I think we must try to snare a bird of some sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's Tommy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just run down to wash.  I dare say she'll bring back the fish with\r\nher.  I put some to bake.  You could eat a little, couldn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try, but I don't feel much like eating.  I want to go to sleep\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, in a few minutes she was sleeping.  \"The very best thing\r\nshe could do,\" said Elizabeth to herself.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour passed and Tommy had not returned.  \"I wonder why\r\nshe is lagging,\" thought Elizabeth.  She went to the entrance of the\r\nhut and looked down towards the shore.  The trees hid the stove from\r\nher, and she did not call out for fear of waking Mary.  She went back\r\ninto the hut and sat down; but after five minutes, when there was still\r\nno Tommy, her vague wonder grew into a slight feeling of alarm.  Seeing\r\nthat Mary was still asleep, she went out again, and ran swiftly down\r\ntowards the stove, glancing to the left with a half expectation of\r\ndiscovering Tommy fishing on the rocks.  But Tommy was not in sight,\r\nand Elizabeth soon learnt why, as her eye caught the scribble on the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n\"How plucky!\" she thought.  \"But the child will be terrified before she\r\ngets there; I had better fetch her back.\"\r\n\r\nBut with a moment's reflection she saw that she could not expect to\r\ncatch Tommy before she reached the top of the ridge.  If there was any\r\ndanger Tommy would have run into it by the time she could be overtaken.\r\nMary was so weak that Elizabeth did not care to leave her for long; but\r\nshe ran some distance up the stream, as far as the broad, bare avenue\r\nmade by the storm, and then was on the point of giving a shrill call\r\nwhen she checked herself.  The sound might cause the very harm she\r\nwished to avoid.  Perturbed, and somewhat vexed as well, she hastened\r\nback, feeling that at present Mary must be her chief care.  She\r\nreflected that, after all, though they had been now more than two\r\nmonths on the island, they had never met any other person, and had no\r\nreal reason to think it was inhabited.  Surely if the object Tommy had\r\nseen was actually a human being, they would by this time have had other\r\nevidence of his existence.  Thus reassuring herself, she hurried back,\r\ntook out of the oven the fish that was already over-baked, and regained\r\nthe hut.  To her great relief Mary was still fast asleep.  Elizabeth\r\ndreaded the effect upon her if she suspected that anything had happened\r\nto Tommy.\r\n\r\nAs she ate her breakfast, reserving some of the fish for Tommy, she\r\nfelt decidedly annoyed at the young girl's escapade.  Tommy ought to\r\nhave mentioned what she intended, thought Elizabeth.  But Tommy had\r\nbeen from her earliest years impulsive and heedless, so that her\r\npresent disobedience--for so Elizabeth had come to regard it,\r\nforgetting that no instructions had been given--was quite apiece with\r\nformer instances.  Then Elizabeth made amends to Tommy in her heart.\r\n\"She has been very good all this time,\" she thought.  \"I do wish she\r\nwould come back.\"\r\n\r\nBut the hours dragged by, and still Tommy had not appeared.  Mary\r\nawoke, and looking round the hut, inquired again for Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"She has run up to get some oranges,\" said Elizabeth, as calmly as she\r\ncould, though she felt very troubled.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy has?\" said Mary, in surprise.  \"Gone alone to where she saw the\r\nface?  Oh, you shouldn't have let her, Bess.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have, only I did not know.  She scrawled on the sand to say\r\nthat she had gone.  I suppose she thought I would make a better nurse\r\nthan she.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's a dear, brave girl,\" said Mary, \"and I shall like the oranges\r\nall the better.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth got her to eat a little fish, cold as it now was, and\r\npresently she dropped off to sleep again.  It was past dinner-time; the\r\nsun was very hot, and Elizabeth, thoroughly alarmed at Tommy's\r\nprotracted absence, wondered if, after her trying night, she had been\r\novercome by the heat, and was, perhaps, lying helpless somewhere.  She\r\nfelt that she must try to find her; so, slipping out of the hut, she\r\nran as fast as her feet would carry her up through the woods, never\r\npausing until she had crossed the ridge and come to the orange grove.\r\nShe had looked about her as she ran, and, now regardless of\r\nconsequences, had called Tommy several times, but she saw neither her\r\nnor any living person, and there was no answer to her calls.\r\n\r\nAt the grove there were oranges and bananas scattered here and there on\r\nthe ground, so that Tommy's absence could not be due to any difficulty\r\nin obtaining what she came for.  And then Elizabeth's heart stood still\r\nas she noticed at one spot, a strange collection of objects.  There\r\nwere four or five oranges on the ground close together, and with them\r\nTommy's knife, the little stick she had fed her parrot with, a piece of\r\nhair-ribbon, and a wedge of cocoanut.  What had happened?  These\r\nobjects were obviously the contents of Tommy's pocket; why had she\r\nplaced them there, and where was she?  Had she been startled?  Had some\r\nnatives come stealthily upon her, and seized her?  Would they not at\r\nleast have taken the knife at the same time?\r\n\r\nElizabeth felt a shiver of fear, along with utter bewilderment.  But\r\nshe crushed down her uneasy imaginings and, placing Tommy's belongings\r\nin her pocket, began to search among the trees, shouting from time to\r\ntime, no matter who might hear her.  Suddenly her eye was caught by the\r\nflutter of a small coloured object at some distance among the bushes.\r\nWith a thrill of hope she hastened towards it, but long before she\r\nreached it, she realized that her hope was vain; the object was only a\r\nbit of tattered cloth attached to one of the line of poles they had\r\nseen on their former visit.  Retracing her steps to the orange grove,\r\nshe went in and out among the trees, shouting Tommy's name again and\r\nagain.  Her distress at Tommy's disappearance was coupled with anxiety\r\nabout Mary.  It was now a considerable time since she had left the hut,\r\nand she felt that, with Mary so weak and helpless, she could not stay\r\nto search any longer.  Thrusting a few oranges into her pocket for the\r\ninvalid, she hastened back, conscious that she herself was weak and\r\nshaky.  The long, anxious search in the fierce sunlight, following a\r\nsleepless night, had been almost too much for her strength.\r\n\r\nShe tried to enter the hut unconcernedly, with a dim hope that Tommy\r\nmight have returned before her.  Mary was awake.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you leave me?\" she said, in the querulous tone of an invalid,\r\nher eyes filling with tears.  \"I've called and called for you and\r\nTommy, but you wouldn't come.  I am so miserable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are some oranges, dear,\" said Elizabeth gently.  \"I will squeeze\r\nthe juice into a cup for you.  It will do you good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you so much.  I'm a wretched bad patient, Bess dear, but I got\r\nit into my silly head that you had deserted me.  Ridiculous, wasn't it?\r\nThis is delicious.  It was kind of Tommy to get them for me.  Where is\r\nshe?\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth was in a quandary.  Mary seemed a little better; her\r\nquerulousness was a good sign; but it would not further her recovery to\r\ntell her that Tommy was missing.  On the other hand, Elizabeth herself\r\nwas so much distressed that she would have liked to pour out her\r\ntroubles to a sympathetic ear.  But she thought it best to keep the bad\r\nnews to herself for the present, and said---\r\n\r\n\"She must have quite recovered her courage, and gone roaming.  You are\r\ngetting on, aren't you, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, only rather weak still.  But these oranges are delicious.  I feel\r\nmuch refreshed.  Don't sit up with me to-night, Bess; I am sure I shall\r\nbe all right, and you mustn't wear yourself out.  Put some oranges near\r\nme, so that I can get one in the night without disturbing you.\"\r\n\r\nShe soon fell asleep again, and did not awaken until it was quite dark.\r\nShe was careful not to disturb her sister, and so did not become aware\r\nuntil the morning that Tommy had not returned.  Elizabeth had spent a\r\nsleepless night, and felt quite worn out when day broke.  Mary was\r\nquick to notice her distress, of which she knew she could not be the\r\ncause, since she was so much better.\r\n\r\n\"You are hiding something, Bess.  Tell me; has something happened to\r\nTommy?\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth, on the verge of a breakdown, was glad to pour out the whole\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, why didn't you tell me before!\" cried Mary.  \"You must go at once\r\nand look for her again.  There is really nothing the matter with me\r\nnow.  Do, please, go, Bess.  It is awful to think of what may have\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\nHastily getting Mary a little food, Elizabeth set out for the orange\r\ngrove, and searched it and the neighbourhood through and through,\r\ncalling Tommy's name until she was hoarse.  Once in response to her\r\nshouts, she thought she heard a faint cry, and hurried in the direction\r\nfrom which she supposed it to have come.\r\n\r\nAt that moment she felt that she would have welcomed the appearance of\r\na native; the sight of any human face would have been a comfort.  But\r\nher search was still fruitless; neither Tommy nor any one else\r\nappeared; and Elizabeth thought she must have been mistaken.  The birds\r\nwere trilling and chattering in the woods, and among so many sounds it\r\nwas easy to deceive oneself.\r\n\r\nAt length, when she had been several hours absent, she felt that she\r\nmust return in case Mary should be wondering whether she too had\r\ndisappeared.  She could hardly drag herself home.  At the entrance of\r\nthe hut she found Mary looking anxiously towards the ridge.\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't have got up,\" she said.  \"Oh, Mary, I can't find her,\r\nand I am so tired.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment it looked as if she would break down utterly, but she\r\ncontrolled herself, and in response to Mary's entreaty, lay down to\r\nrest.  Fatigue even overcame her distress of mind, and for an hour or\r\ntwo she slept heavily.  Then she awoke with a start, and declared that\r\nshe must go and search again.  Swallowing a little food, she set off,\r\nand thoroughly hunted over a wider area than before, not returning\r\nuntil the evening.\r\n\r\n\"It's no good,\" she said, despairing.  \"Poor Tommy's gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say so,\" said Mary.  \"You haven't seen any one, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she may only be lost.  You know how venturesome she is, and\r\nhaving found no one to be afraid of perhaps she has gone right over the\r\nisland, and sprained her ankle or something.  Have a good sleep, Bess.\r\nTo-morrow we'll both go.  I'm sure I shall be strong enough.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning, after a breakfast of bananas and oranges--for there was,\r\nof course, no fish--the girls set off together.  Mary, although a\r\nlittle \"tottery,\" as she said, was able to walk slowly, and she\r\ndeclared it was much better for her to go too, than to remain at home\r\nwondering what was happening.  Elizabeth had to support her, and she\r\nstopped for frequent rests; but they came at length to the orange grove.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I'll stay here,\" she said, \"in the shade of the trees, while you\r\ngo round and round; and if you don't find her here, go right over the\r\nridge and cooee every few seconds.  I won't stir until you come back.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nIN THE PIT\r\n\r\nWhen Tommy left the hut she ran with all the fleetness of her young\r\nlegs up towards the ridge.  All the way she said to herself, \"I won't\r\nbe afraid, I won't, I won't,\" keeping up her courage also with the\r\nthought of the surprise she would give her sisters when she returned\r\nladen with fruit.\r\n\r\nThe morning was somewhat misty, but the mist was not so thick as to\r\nhide the general features of the country.  As before, she followed the\r\ncourse of the stream, and when she came to the swamp she turned to the\r\nright, and continued as nearly as possible in a straight line with the\r\ncrest.  Arriving at the top, she stopped for a few moments rather\r\npuzzled.  The appearance of the country was unfamiliar; the spot she\r\nhad reached was certainly not the place to which she, with her sisters,\r\nhad come on the former excursion.  It was clear that she had wandered\r\nsomewhat from the proper route.\r\n\r\nShe went on, the very difficulty in which she found herself helping to\r\nstrengthen her determination.  There were trees on all sides, but for\r\nsome time she discovered none that were bearing oranges.  At length,\r\nhowever, as the mist lifted, she perceived some golden spots among the\r\nfoliage, and ran towards them.  She hoped that this was not the orange\r\ngrove in which she had been so much frightened, and a return of her\r\nnervousness made her quicken her pace and gather, in a kind of frantic\r\nhaste, a number of oranges that bespattered the ground.\r\n\r\nIn order to turn her journey to the utmost advantage she meant to fill\r\nher pocket with oranges and take as many as possible in her hands as\r\nwell.  But remembering that her pocket was usually full of all sorts of\r\nodds and ends, she knelt down to empty it and throw away what was\r\nuseless, so as to have more room for the oranges.  She had just laid on\r\nthe ground her knife and a few oddments when, throwing in spite of\r\nherself a nervous glance around, she noticed a slight movement in the\r\nbushes on her right--the direction in which she had come.  She could\r\nnot help looking again, and then she sprang to her feet transfixed with\r\nterror.  There was the same little brown face peering out from among\r\nthe background of foliage.  For a few seconds the two pairs of eyes\r\nremained staring at each other; then, scarcely knowing what she did,\r\nbut in an instinctive movement of defence, Tommy waved her arms towards\r\nthe bush.\r\n\r\nThe face instantly disappeared, but Tommy in her agitation forgot her\r\nerrand, forgot the things she had placed beside her, and took to her\r\nheels, flying in a blind panic from the spot.  She did not even stay to\r\nmake sure she was going in the right direction; she had quite lost\r\ncommand of herself, and regardless of thorns and creepers that tore her\r\nskirts and tripped her steps, she plunged through the undergrowth.\r\nEvery sound seemed to her excited imagination to be made by pursuers\r\nfollowing upon her track.  Suddenly the earth gave way beneath her, she\r\nfelt herself sinking, sinking.  \"Bess!  Bess!\" she screamed, and then\r\nshe knew no more.\r\n\r\nWhen she regained consciousness she found herself in semi-darkness.\r\nFor a moment she was simply bewildered; she was half smothered with\r\ntwigs, leaves and earth; then she remembered all that had happened and\r\nsprang to her feet.  But an excruciating pain in her left ankle caused\r\nher to fall back, and the agony was so intense that she remained for\r\nsome time in a half-fainting condition.  Presently she recovered.  A\r\nsecond attempt to rise gave her such a twinge that she knew her ankle\r\nwas seriously sprained; to move without help was impossible.\r\n\r\nHer fear of the little brown face was overcome by a still greater\r\nanxiety.  Where was she?  She looked about her.  Some distance above\r\nher head, considerably higher than the rooms at the farm, was a wide\r\nopening.  She must have fallen into a pit.  But it seemed to her a\r\nstrange pit, for, her eyes becoming accustomed to the dimness, she saw\r\nthat the floor upon which she lay was much broader than the opening at\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nAn insect touching her hand made her jump: and with a feeling of horror\r\nshe wondered if the pit was infested with noxious creatures that would\r\nsting her to death.  She shouted, frantically, again and again, but her\r\nvoice only seemed to be thrown back at her; and when she remembered how\r\nfar off her sisters were, she realized that her cries, if they were\r\nheard above, could bring only the savages from whom she had fled.\r\n\r\nFor a time she cowered among the trash, overwhelmed with despair.\r\nThen, when she was calm enough to think, it was only to recognize more\r\nfully the seriousness of her plight.  Her sisters could never guess\r\nwhat had become of her.  If they took alarm at her absence, and\r\nElizabeth came in search of her, it was quite likely that she would\r\nnever discover the spot.  Perhaps even she might be captured by the\r\nnatives, for the sight of the little brown face had convinced Tommy\r\nthat beyond the ridge the island was overrun with cannibals.  It was\r\nnothing to her that they had never appeared on her side of the island;\r\nshe told herself that they had simply waited until they could catch one\r\ngirl alone.  Nor did it seem to her ridiculous that a tribe of\r\nbloodthirsty savages should be so timorous as to refrain from openly\r\nattacking three defenceless girls.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful thought occurred to her, \"Am I to die in this prison?\"\r\nThe prospect of such a fate made her shiver.  She felt that even to\r\nfall into the hands of cannibals was preferable to a lingering death in\r\nthis pit, and again she raised her voice in wild cries for help,\r\nrepeating them until she was exhausted.  For some time she remained in\r\na state of stupor: but when she was able to collect herself she\r\nwondered whether, in spite of her injured foot, she could, by any\r\nexertion of her own, escape.  She crept on hands and knees to the side\r\nof the pit; but even if she had been able to use her foot she saw that\r\nshe could never climb up those sloping walls.\r\n\r\nGlancing round, however, she saw that in the wall to her right there\r\nwas an opening yawning black.  She crawled to it, and peered in.  It\r\nwas so dark that she could see nothing beyond a yard.  But she felt a\r\nfaint hope that it might be a passage leading somehow to the level\r\nground.  Recollecting her automatic match-box, which, fortunately, she\r\nkept attached to her belt, she threw its small flickering light on the\r\nscene.  She saw now that she was indeed at the entrance of a tunnel.\r\nIt could not be a short one if it led to the outer air, for there was\r\nno glimmer of light from its black depths.  But it was worth trying;\r\nso, the light, small as it was, giving her a sense of security, she\r\nbegan to creep slowly along the dark passage, every now and again\r\nwincing as a pang shot through her injured foot.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange tunnel; not rounded and of regular shape like the\r\nrailway tunnels at home, but varying in width and height.  In some\r\nplaces the roof was beyond the range of Tommy's feeble light; at others\r\nit came so low that she could not have stood upright.  The floor was\r\nuneven, the walls were rugged, a recess here, a protuberance there.\r\nClearly it had not been cut by the hands of men, but must be attributed\r\nto a freak of nature.\r\n\r\nTo Tommy, crawling inch by inch along the ground, it seemed that the\r\ntunnel would never end.  How long it was, how many minutes or hours\r\nthis painful progress continued, she was quite unable to guess.  At\r\nlast, with a cry of gladness, she saw a faint gleam of light beyond,\r\nand tried to advance more quickly, so as to gain liberty and fresh air.\r\nThe light came through an aperture in the wall that appeared to be the\r\nend of the passage.  It was high above the ground, and Tommy, standing\r\non one foot, was just able to look through it.  She thought that if she\r\ncould only manage to heave herself up to it, the aperture was just wide\r\nenough to let her body through.\r\n\r\nBut first of all she must make sure that it led to safety.  It was not\r\nfull daylight outside; beyond the wall there appeared to be, not open\r\nspace, but another confined chamber.  Supposing she climbed up and got\r\nthrough, how far would she have to drop to reach the ground on the\r\nother side? and what if she should find herself only in another place\r\nfrom which escape would be no easier than from the pit?\r\n\r\nTo stand on one foot was fatiguing, and Tommy had to sit down and rest\r\nfor a little.  She had now recovered from her panic, and was ready to\r\nbend all her young wits upon the problem of escape.  Presently a means\r\noccurred to her of discovering at least whether it would be safe for\r\nher to make an attempt to clamber through the aperture.  She felt along\r\nthe floor for a piece of rock, and standing up again, dropped it over\r\nthe ledge.  In an instant there came a faint thud, and immediately\r\nafterwards a great whirring and screaming.  She was quick to infer that\r\nthe ground was at some depth below the opening, and that the falling\r\nrock had disturbed a colony of birds of some kind.  \"Can I be at the\r\ntop of a cliff?\" she thought.\r\n\r\nPlainly it was impossible to escape in this direction.  The dashing of\r\nher hope almost made Tommy weep.  She had done no good; indeed had only\r\nwasted time.  There was nothing for it but to crawl back to the pit;\r\nand as she wearily crept through the passage despair seized upon her\r\nheart; she felt the choking sensation of helpless misery.\r\n\r\nHer terror was even deepened when, on getting back to the pit, she\r\nfound that it was now quite dark.  Through the opening she could see\r\nthe stars overhead, but there was no pleasure in watching them as she\r\nhad many times watched them from the hut.  She crouched upon the\r\nleaves, scarcely able to bear the throbbing pain in her foot; and when\r\npresently she fell asleep from sheer exhaustion, it was with a prayer\r\non her lips: \"God help me, and let me see my sisters again.\"\r\n\r\nPain and thirst awakened her several times before dawn.  A slight\r\nshower fell during the night, and by catching the raindrops in her\r\noutspread palm she was able to moisten her parched lips.  She also\r\nwetted her handkerchief and bound it about her inflamed ankle, thus\r\neasing the pain a little.  When it was quite light overhead she began\r\nto shout again, her voice sounding very cracked and hoarse.  Soon she\r\nhad to give up even this; her tongue and the roof of her mouth were so\r\ndry that she could not utter a word.  Then she lost all hope, and lying\r\ndown sobbed herself to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke it was again dark.  Her foot was much less painful, but\r\nshe felt more hungry and thirsty than ever before in her life.  If only\r\nshe had filled her pocket with oranges before she saw that little brown\r\nface!  Again the idea came to her of attempting to climb the side of\r\nthe pit by cutting steps in the earth; but on feeling in her pocket she\r\nremembered that she had dropped her knife on the ground.  Hobbling\r\nacross the pit she felt along the walls, only to find, as before, that\r\ntheir slope made it quite impossible to clamber up.  Then feeling that\r\nstarvation must be her doom, she sank back and lay in a state of dreamy\r\nsomnolence.\r\n\r\nAll at once she was startled into wakefulness by a faint sound\r\nsomewhere above her.  She sprang up.  Sunlight was streaming through\r\nthe opening; the sound came again.  It was some one calling.  Tommy\r\ntried to shout in answer, but the feeble croak that was all she could\r\nutter dismayed her.  With help at hand, she might not be heard!  The\r\ncall above was now quite clear.  It was coming nearer.  She heard her\r\nown name.  But the more she tried to call the less she seemed able to\r\nmake a sound.  The voice above began to recede.  Then with a last\r\ndesperate effort she did manage to produce a hoarse cry that she could\r\nscarcely believe came from her own throat, so strange it was.  It\r\nseemed to have used up all the little strength she had left, and she\r\nfell exhausted to the ground, believing that the last chance of rescue\r\nhad now utterly vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE ELEVENTH HOUR\r\n\r\nSome little time after Elizabeth had left her, Mary fancied that she\r\ncaught a faint cry.  She shouted to her sister, who was out of sight,\r\nbut whose voice she heard calling at intervals.  The feeble sound\r\nseemed to have come from a patch of woodland not a great distance from\r\nthe track which Elizabeth had taken.  But as the wind was blowing from\r\nthat quarter, Mary realized that although she could hear Elizabeth it\r\nwas probably impossible for Elizabeth to hear her.  She felt very tired\r\nafter her long walk, and doubted whether she could go far without her\r\nsister's sustaining arm; but the thought that Elizabeth might wander\r\nout of reach while Tommy was in danger near at hand gave her an\r\nartificial strength.  She rose from the ground and tottered in the\r\ndirection from which the cry had appeared to come.  Every now and then\r\nshe stopped, listening for a repetition of the sound; but she heard\r\nnothing except the rustle of the wind and Elizabeth's shouts, growing\r\nfainter and fainter in the distance.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments she had passed beyond the orange grove, and felt that\r\nshe was in danger of losing her way.  Even Elizabeth's voice soon\r\nceased to guide her.  She stumbled along, shouting every few steps,\r\nwith no other result than to disturb the birds in the trees.  Becoming\r\nalarmed at the possibility of being lost and her strength failing, she\r\nwas on the point of trying to find her way back, and gave one last\r\ncall, when she was electrified by hearing a strange hoarse sound\r\napparently coming from some distance to the left.  It was little like a\r\nhuman voice; yet it was not the cry of a bird, and Mary hurried with\r\nuneven steps towards it.\r\n\r\nThe ground rose steeply, leading up to the ridge far to the left.  But\r\nwith the new strength lent by excitement Mary was not conscious of the\r\nslope.  She came to a number of straggling bushes edged by an irregular\r\ncircle of small trees.  Here she looked eagerly around her, peering\r\nthrough the bushes and between the trunks of the trees, listening for\r\nthat strange cry to be repeated.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound, but as her eyes travelled over the circuit she\r\nnoticed what seemed to be a small landslip in the bank.  Following this\r\ndownward, her glance discovered a hole in the ground several feet wide.\r\nMoved by a sudden impulse, and the instinctive feeling that here was\r\nthe explanation of Tommy's disappearance, she stumbled forward, hardly\r\nconscious of her trembling limbs.  Throwing herself flat on the ground\r\nat the edge of the hole, she gazed into the pit beneath.  It was some\r\nmoments before her eyes became used to the half-light; but then she saw\r\nsomething white; she distinguished it as part of an object huddled on\r\nthe ground immediately beneath the opening; and she knew that Tommy was\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nBut an agonizing fear seized her.  Was Tommy dead?  She called down in\r\na low voice.  There was no answer.  She called again and still again,\r\nher tones growing louder as she became more alarmed.  At length, after\r\nwhat seemed an age of suspense, her strained gaze noticed a slight\r\nmovement in the figure below, and a faint whisper came up to her.\r\n\"Thank God!\" her heart cried out, and she eagerly called to Tommy,\r\nsaying that she would soon be safe.  But Tommy made no reply; she had\r\nrelapsed into unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nMary was at her wits' end what to do.  It was clear that Tommy was\r\nhelpless.  A pang shot through Mary's heart as she remembered that the\r\ngirl had been without food for two days and two nights.  The hole was\r\nso deep that even if Tommy had been conscious Mary could not have\r\nhelped her, at the utmost stretch of her arms, to get out.  Elizabeth\r\nwas beyond hearing: she might return to the orange grove: what would\r\nshe do if she found Mary missing?  Mary dared not leave the\r\nneighbourhood of the pit now that Tommy was found: but she wanted to\r\nrun after Elizabeth and bring her to the spot.\r\n\r\nWhile she was still undecided she heard Elizabeth's voice in the far\r\ndistance.  She shouted in reply, though she still felt that against the\r\nwind her voice could not be heard.  But in a few moments she was\r\ngladdened to know from the growing loudness of the shouts that\r\nElizabeth was returning.  There was a chance that as she drew nearer\r\nshe would hear a shrill call, so Mary every few moments formed a\r\ntrumpet with her hands, and let forth a prolonged \"Cooee!\"  Presently\r\nshe knew by the tone of Elizabeth's call that her voice had been heard;\r\nbut, so confusing are sounds amid woods and thickets, it was a long\r\ntime before Elizabeth discovered where she was, and came hurrying\r\nthrough the trees.\r\n\r\n\"Have you found her?\" she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"She is down there,\" replied Mary, pointing to the mouth of the pit.\r\n\"Oh, Bess, I'm afraid she is very much hurt, perhaps dying!\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth, with an exclamation of dismay, threw herself down and peered\r\ninto the hole.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy!  Tommy dear!\" she called.\r\n\r\nBut there was no answer.  Elizabeth measured with her eye the depth of\r\nthe pit; she felt tempted to spring down and see if Tommy were alive or\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\"Will you stay here while I run back and get the painter?\" she asked.\r\nAt that moment neither of the girls thought of savages: fear for Tommy\r\nhad banished every other fear.\r\n\r\n\"It will take so long,\" murmured Mary.  \"You would be gone an hour at\r\nleast, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"I know a way,\" Elizabeth interrupted; \"we'll make a rope of creepers.\r\nIt won't take us long.\"\r\n\r\nShe darted off into the forest.  In building the hut she had become\r\nexpert in selecting strong tendrils for binding their lattice-work, and\r\nin a few moments she had cut, among the dense undergrowth, a\r\nconsiderable quantity of tough material with which she hurried back to\r\nthe pit.  The two girls at once set to work with nimble fingers\r\nplaiting the tendrils together.\r\n\r\n\"She must be famished, and dead with thirst,\" said Mary.  \"If we could\r\nonly give her some water.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a little brook not far away,\" said Elizabeth.  \"When we have\r\ndone the rope we'll make a cup of leaves, and I'll fetch some water.\r\nThen you must let me down into the pit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could never do it,\" said Mary, \"I am not strong enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not by yourself, but I'll fasten one end of the rope to that tree you\r\nsee there; then we'll pass it round that little one near us, and you\r\nwill be strong enough to pay it out.  That's the only way.\"\r\n\r\nThey worked very quickly, and finished a long, stout rope in little\r\nmore time than the journey home would have taken.  While Mary made\r\nseveral cups from the large spreading leaves of a plant like rhubarb,\r\nElizabeth wound one end of the rope tightly about the tree trunk she\r\nhad pointed out.  In the other end she made a loop to cling to.\r\n\r\n\"The rope is not long enough,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Not to reach the bottom, but that doesn't matter.  I can drop a few\r\nfeet.  When you have let me down, run down that slope, Mary, and you'll\r\nfind the brook a little way to the right.  Bring two of the leaves\r\nfilled with water, and let them down by the rope.  Pierce a hole in\r\neach side of the cups near the top, and pass the rope through: you'll\r\nsee how to do it.  Now take the rope firmly.  I'll slip over the edge,\r\nand when I give the word let it run out gently around the tree.\"\r\n\r\nPale with anxiety and weakness, Mary took up her position at the tree.\r\nShe made a determined effort to obey Elizabeth's instructions.  Inch by\r\ninch the rope slipped through her hands, at last so fast that she held\r\nher breath in terror lest Elizabeth should be dashed to the ground.\r\nThe rope was stretched to its extreme tension; then it suddenly\r\nrelaxed; and next moment she heard the welcome cry from the pit: \"I'm\r\nsafe.  Now for the water.\"\r\n\r\nGathering herself together, Mary sped off to the brook, carrying the\r\ntwo leaf cups.  Eagerness to help lent her strength.  She returned with\r\nthem brimming, drew up the rope, and unfastened the loop at the end.\r\nThen passing two of the strands through the holes made in the cup, she\r\nlet it down slowly into the pit.  Some of the water was spilled in the\r\ndescent; but Elizabeth said that enough was left for the moment.\r\n\r\n\"How is she?\" asked Mary, dreading to hear that Tommy was past help.\r\n\r\n\"She is unconscious, but breathing,\" said Elizabeth.  \"I'll give her\r\nsome water.\"\r\n\r\nFor some little time Mary heard no more.  Elizabeth bathed Tommy's head\r\nand moistened her lips.  At length the young girl gave a long sigh and\r\nmoan.\r\n\r\n\"I'm here, dear,\" said Elizabeth gently.  \"Mary is above.  You are safe\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"The face!\" moaned Tommy, her mind leaping back over all that had\r\nhappened since she had seen those eyes staring at her.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said Elizabeth, stroking her head.  \"There is nothing to harm\r\nyou.  Drink a little water; we must see about getting you out of this\r\npit, you know.\"\r\n\r\nTommy drank eagerly, holding Elizabeth's hands in a tight clasp.\r\n\r\n\"We are getting on famously,\" Elizabeth called to reassure Mary.\r\n\r\nTommy lay still, taking a sip of water every now and again, too weak to\r\nmove or to speak.  Meanwhile Elizabeth was beating her brain for some\r\nmeans of getting her to the surface.  It was clear that Tommy for some\r\ntime would be unable to do anything for herself.  Lightly built though\r\nshe was, her dead weight was far more than Elizabeth could hope to\r\nsustain, hanging on to the rope, and with no one but Mary to assist\r\nfrom above.  The rope was too short by several feet; the first\r\nnecessity was to lengthen it.  Presently, therefore, when Tommy was\r\nmore recovered, Elizabeth asked Mary to cut some more creepers and\r\nthrow them down.  Now her practice in splicing on board her uncle's\r\nship was very useful.  She quickly added three or four feet to the\r\nrope's length.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy dear, I'm going to leave you for a little,\" she said.  \"You are\r\nquite safe now.  I'm going to arrange about lifting you out of this\r\nhorrid place.  You must be hungry, poor thing.  I'll get a few oranges;\r\nyou can reach them if we throw them down, can't you? and bananas too;\r\nthey're more substantial.  By the time I am ready to lift you out\r\nyou'll be heaps stronger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary won't go?\" said Tommy quiveringly.\r\n\r\n\"No, she'll stay with you.  You can hear her when she speaks to you:\r\nbut don't try to talk yourself; just eat the fruit I shall give you and\r\nget strong.\"\r\n\r\nShe then told Mary to come to the edge of the pit and be ready to help\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"But take care you don't overbalance,\" she said.  \"It mustn't be a case\r\nof three girls in a pit.\"\r\n\r\nTired as Elizabeth had been, the joy of discovering Tommy alive had\r\nbraced her, and she felt equal to any exertion.  But she had not had\r\nTommy's practice in tree-climbing, nor in clambering up the rigging on\r\nthe barque; and when she clasped the rope and tried to draw herself up\r\nshe slipped down again and again.  For a time she felt baffled, but a\r\nmeans of overcoming the difficulty occurred to her.\r\n\r\n\"Pull up the rope, Mary,\" she said, \"and make knots in it about two\r\nfeet apart.  I shall be able to manage it then, I think.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the knots were made she tried again.  It was a terrible strain on\r\nher wrists, and she got no assistance for her feet from the shelving\r\nsides of the pit.  But the knots gave a firm hold, and she managed to\r\nclimb hand over hand to the edge, where, with Mary's help, she heaved\r\nherself on to the level ground.\r\n\r\n\"Do rest,\" said Mary, noticing the signs of strain on her sister's face.\r\n\r\n\"I am not a bit tired.  Look, Mary, I want you to plait another rope.\r\nI'll get the stuff for you.\"\r\n\r\nShe hastened into the undergrowth, and returned with her arms full of\r\ncreepers.\r\n\r\n\"Now I'm going to get Tommy some food, and then run back to the hut.\r\nI'll be as quick as I can.  Talk to her while I am away to keep her\r\nspirits up.\"\r\n\r\nSoon she was flinging an armful of bananas and oranges, one by one,\r\ninto the pit.\r\n\r\n\"There's a feast for you,\" she said cheerfully.  \"Now in about an hour\r\nyou'll be released.  Eat slowly, that's the rule after fasting, isn't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a dear,\" said Mary, hugging her.  \"What should we have done\r\nwithout you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear girl, without me you wouldn't have been here at all, we all\r\ncame together.  Good-bye for an hour.\"\r\n\r\nShe flitted off as lightly as a bird, overflowing with happiness.\r\nReaching the hut she took up the longest of the mat beds, her own, and\r\nwithout waiting for a moment to rest, hurried back to her sister,\r\nannouncing herself from a distance by a cheerful cooee.\r\n\r\n\"All well?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy has been telling me all about it,\" said Mary.  \"She saw the\r\nlittle brown face again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bother the little brown face!\" said Elizabeth.  \"Really, I should like\r\nto smack it.  Tommy's well enough to talk, is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but she has sprained her ankle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor girl! it will be hoppety-hop when we get her up, then.  Now see\r\nhow we'll manage it.  You've finished that rope?  We'll make a cradle\r\nof my bed.\"\r\n\r\nShe made two holes at each end of the mat large enough for the ropes to\r\npass through.  In this way she formed a rough cradle upon which Tommy\r\ncould be drawn up, for the girl's weight would keep it steady if the\r\nropes were placed far enough apart.  The cradle was soon ready for\r\nlowering.\r\n\r\n\"Can you manage to get on to it yourself, Tommy?\" asked Elizabeth, \"or\r\nshall I come down again and help you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can manage,\" answered Tommy.  \"I am ever so much better.  Are you\r\nsure it's strong enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certain, I'd trust myself on it.  All you will have to do will be to\r\nclutch a rope at each end and hold tight.  Call out when you are ready.\"\r\n\r\nShe and Mary then each took the end of a rope and passed it round a\r\ntree, the two trees being not quite so far apart as the length of the\r\nmat.  Tommy gave the word.  They began to haul.  The trees relieved\r\nthem of all strain, and making a succession of short pulls, with rests\r\nin between, they drew the cradle inch by inch to the surface.\r\nElizabeth was afraid that Mary's strength might give way, or that Tommy\r\nwould lose her grip of the ropes; but neither of these mishaps\r\noccurred, and with a final pull they hauled Tommy and cradle over the\r\nbrink of the pit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WITH A FINAL PULL THEY HAULED TOMMY OVER THE BRINK.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd then overwrought nerves gave way.  Elizabeth ran to Tommy, clasped\r\nher in her arms, and burst into tears.  A little later, when all three\r\ngirls were sitting together weeping in sympathy, Elizabeth exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Well, we are a lot of babies.  We ought to be shouting for joy.  I'm\r\nquite ashamed of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not,\" said Mary stoutly.  \"I think it's a blessing we can cry a\r\nlittle.  It eases the nerves.  Boys never cry, and what's the result?\r\nThey get as crabby as two sticks.\"\r\n\r\n\"How am I to get you two poor invalids home?\" said Elizabeth.  \"You\r\nhave done wonders, Mary, but you would be utterly done up if you tried\r\nto walk back.  And Tommy certainly can't walk.  We shall have to stay\r\nhere for the night; fortunately, it is fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, we _must_ get home, Bess,\" said Tommy earnestly.  \"I could not\r\nbear to stay here after seeing that face.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there can't be anything to harm us,\" persisted Elizabeth.  \"I have\r\nwalked round and round, miles altogether, and haven't seen a single\r\nsign of people.  You are quite sure it was a human face?  Mayn't it\r\nhave been a monkey or an owl?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I am sure of it.  You never saw such eyes, they seemed to burn\r\nlike fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"But didn't you see a body, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, just a face.  That was what frightened me so; just a face that\r\nseemed all eyes.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth saw that Tommy had been too much scared to take real notice\r\nof anything, and decided that for the sake of her peace of mind it\r\nwould be better to make an attempt to reach home.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, it's a case of pick-a-back.  I'll carry you.  Mary\r\nmust get along as well as she can.  It will take us an age, but we can\r\nrest on the way.\"\r\n\r\nThey started, Mary carrying Elizabeth's mat, and Elizabeth carrying\r\nTommy.  Slowly and with many halts they made their way down, reaching\r\nthe hut about their usual tea-time.  The two elder girls had taken\r\nprecautions to fill their pockets with fruit as they skirted the orange\r\ngrove.  They had no other fruit in the hut except cocoanuts, and\r\nElizabeth was too worn out to think of catching fish.  They satisfied\r\nthemselves with a meal of fruit.\r\n\r\nTommy was delighted with the behaviour of her parrot, Billy.  Overjoyed\r\nat the return of its mistress, it hopped upon her shoulder, cocking its\r\nhead and uttering cries loud but by no means sweet.\r\n\r\n\"A welcome home, Tommy,\" said Elizabeth, smiling.  \"We can't gush, Mary\r\nand I, but we are more glad than we can say, dear, and Billy says it\r\nfor us as well as he can.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after Tommy's ankle had been bathed and bound up, they threw\r\nthemselves on their simple couches, and, all their present anxieties\r\nset at rest, slept heavily until the sun woke them to another day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nNEW TERRORS\r\n\r\nA few days' rest, and a steady improvement in the weather, restored the\r\ninvalids to their former health.  The daily round went on as\r\nbefore--fishing, gathering fruit, ascending the cliff to take their\r\ncustomary look over the sea.  They often talked of the face Tommy had\r\nseen.  It was more mysterious than ever.  Elizabeth, while her sisters\r\nwere still confined to the hut, made a visit by herself to the orange\r\ngrove, and determined if she saw the face to discover once for all to\r\nwhom it belonged.  But though she looked in every tree and bush and\r\nscoured the neighbourhood thoroughly, she never once caught sight of\r\nthe face with the two burning eyes.  Once she heard a rustling amongst\r\nthe bushes and dashed towards the sound, but there was nothing to be\r\nseen, and she returned thoroughly baffled.\r\n\r\nOne morning when Elizabeth was preparing breakfast she heard Mary, who\r\nhad gone to the look-out, shouting in great excitement.  The two other\r\ngirls rushed to join her, and saw far away in the offing a three-masted\r\nship under full sail.  The breeze was light, and the vessel appeared to\r\nbe moving very slowly.  Mary had already waved her handkerchief: the\r\nothers did the same, but they soon realized that the ship was too far\r\naway for their signals to be noticed.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go after her in the boat,\" suggested Tommy.  \"They might see\r\nthat moving on the water.\"\r\n\r\nAs there seemed just a possibility of thus attracting attention, they\r\nran down to the beach and launched the boat.  Elizabeth, being the\r\nstrongest, took the sculls and pulled as hard as she could towards the\r\nopening in the reef; while Tommy steered, and Mary from time to time\r\nrose in her place and waved her handkerchief.  By the time they came\r\ninto the open sea the ship was almost opposite to them, sailing due\r\nwest.  There was no sign that they had been observed; she held steadily\r\nto her course.  They shouted; Tommy put her fingers to her lips and\r\ngave a shrill whistle, an accomplishment which some of her friends at\r\nhome had condemned as unladylike.  But the ship stood on her way.  The\r\ngirls' hearts sank as they saw the distance between it and them\r\ngradually widen; and Elizabeth, who had been pulling gallantly for\r\nhalf-an-hour or more, at last collapsed on her oars.\r\n\r\nThey were all too much upset to speak.  To have seen a vessel at last,\r\nafter so many weeks of waiting, and then to be passed by, was a\r\nterrible disappointment to them.  They were distressed not merely at\r\nthe loss of the chance of immediate rescue, but at the staggering\r\nthought that the same thing might happen again.  It was evident that\r\nthe island lay out of the usual track; no vessel could ever have a\r\nreason for visiting it; and lacking the power of making effective\r\nsignals they might remain there for years and years without any one\r\never being aware of their existence.\r\n\r\nThe light boat rocked to the long Pacific swell, and the girls battled\r\nwith their tears.  They strained their eyes after the dwindling vessel,\r\nhoping against hope that even yet she might change her course and come\r\nback to them.  But when there was nothing but a speck on the horizon,\r\nElizabeth, her face full of despair, took up the sculls again and began\r\nto pull slowly in silence towards home.\r\n\r\nAs the boat's head turned they were aghast to find how far distant they\r\nwere from the island.  The high cliffs seemed little more than a low\r\nbank: clearly they were miles away.  Elizabeth, knowing that her\r\nsculling powers could not wholly account for the great distance,\r\nsuddenly remembered the current.  From the time the boat passed the\r\nreef it had been subject to the full strength of the ocean stream that\r\nswept the shore.  They would have to row back against it, and with the\r\nsun mounting higher, and no food or water on board, they realized that\r\nthey must look forward to hours of discomfort, if not actual danger.\r\n\r\nThe boat made little headway against the current, and Elizabeth had\r\nworked so hard that now she was scarcely able to move the sculls.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, can you take my place for a little while?\" she said.  \"I will\r\nrow again after a rest.\"\r\n\r\nThey exchanged places, stooping low and moving very carefully.  The\r\nboat lost many yards while the exchange was being made.  Tommy had\r\nquite recovered her strength, and was able to take a long spell at the\r\nsculls.  But progress was very slow.  Elizabeth steered with the idea\r\nof getting under the shelter of the island.  She noticed by and by that\r\nTommy was tiring, and proposed to take the sculls again; but Mary\r\npleaded to be allowed to share in the work.  Thus relieving one\r\nanother, they crept gradually towards the island, not daring to cease\r\nsculling altogether, and yet finding it more and more exhausting as the\r\nday grew hotter.\r\n\r\nBy almost imperceptible degrees the cliffs heightened and objects upon\r\nthem became more distinct.  The girl who was steering at the time\r\nencouraged the sculler by mentioning each new landmark as it became\r\ndistinguishable.  Recognizing that it would be hours before they could\r\nattain their own little harbour, Elizabeth decided to make for the\r\nnearest point of the shore in the hope of finding another\r\nlanding-place.  At last they began to benefit by the shelter of the\r\nisland, and their progress became more rapid.  But when, after\r\nexertions that had tried them all severely, they came out of the\r\ncurrent into comparatively still water near the shore, they had to row\r\nfor some distance before, in a cutting between the cliffs, they\r\ndiscovered a broad, sandy beach on which it was possible to land.  Here\r\nthey pulled the boat a few yards up the sand, and then hurried along\r\nthe chine in search of fresh water to assuage their burning thirst.\r\n\r\nWithin a short distance of the beach the chine was covered with\r\nvegetation, among which they saw several cocoa-nut palms.  To these\r\nthey hastened in the hope of finding some nuts upon the ground.  But\r\nthere were none.  Tommy looked longingly up into the trees, but it was\r\nimpossible to climb them, and the girls hurried on again, expecting to\r\nfind somewhere a rill trickling from the high ground to the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone some distance the trees thinned, and they saw, some\r\nhundreds of yards in front of them, a sheer wall of rock, rising to a\r\nconsiderable height and dotted here and there with scrub.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, I believe that's the end of the ridge,\" said Elizabeth,\r\nwho had a shrewder eye than the others for country, and had a better\r\nnotion as to the part of the island to which they had come.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" cried Tommy; \"_that's_ what I want.\"  She pointed to a\r\nsparkling waterfall that plunged over a ledge a good way to their left.\r\nThey ran eagerly towards it, scrambling over impediments, and soon came\r\nto the stream which the waterfall fed.  Then they threw themselves\r\ndown, and gulped large draughts of the cold water.  After resting for a\r\nwhile on the grassy bank, Elizabeth looked at her watch.\r\n\r\n\"It is past two,\" she said; \"what a time we have been!\"\r\n\r\n\"Without breakfast or dinner,\" said Tommy dolefully, \"and no chance of\r\nsupper either, as far as I can see, if we have to row back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we had better walk it,\" suggested Elizabeth; \"I've had enough\r\nrowing for one day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we find the way?\" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n\"If we are near the end of the ridge, as I think we are,\" replied\r\nElizabeth, \"we can't go far wrong.  It takes us half-an-hour or more\r\nfrom the ridge home, and I shouldn't think it would take us long to\r\nreach a place that we recognize.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the orange grove,\" said Tommy; \"I won't go past it, I\r\nabsolutely won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dear, I dare say we can go round about,\" said Elizabeth\r\nplacably, \"though I'm so tired and hungry, and I am sure you are too,\r\nthat the shorter our walk the better.  Let us rest a little longer\r\nuntil it's not quite so hot.  But we mustn't stay too long, in case I\r\nam mistaken and we find ourselves lost in the dark.\"\r\n\r\nAbout half-an-hour later they rose to make their way homeward.\r\nElizabeth had resolved to follow up the stream until they reached the\r\nwaterfall, then to strike to the left, skirting the precipice.  She\r\nexpected to come to the thick belt of woodland of which the orange\r\ngrove was a part.  Tommy did not go ahead as her custom was.  Since her\r\nfright she had been a more sedate and sober Tommy.\r\n\r\nThey had gone but a short distance upstream though a fringe of trees,\r\nwhen all at once they halted and started back.  The trees suddenly came\r\nto an end, and a few yards in front of them stood a tiny structure,\r\nwhich, ignorant as they were, they knew for a native hut.  It was\r\nconical in shape, made apparently of grass and thatch, with a small\r\nopening only high enough to crawl through.  It was placed at the foot\r\nof a slope, and the space before it had evidently been cleared by hand,\r\nfor there were stumps of trees here and there.\r\n\r\nThe three girls, struck with consternation, slipped back within the\r\nshelter of the trees.  Tommy clung to Elizabeth's hand.  Here was\r\nconfirmation of her story.  It said much for her restraint, or perhaps\r\nfor the renewal of her fears, that she did not turn upon Mary with a\r\nwhispered \"I told you so.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth had determined if she should see a native to show a bold\r\nfront and try to make friends with him.  Now, though Tommy on one side\r\nand Mary on the other were pulling her back, she stood her ground,\r\nwhispering, \"Wait: perhaps it is deserted.\"  But she had scarcely\r\nuttered the words when, from among the trees on the other side of the\r\nstream, about two hundred yards away, they caught sight of a native\r\napproaching.  They were only aware that it was the figure of a man: all\r\nElizabeth's bold resolutions evaporated.  Without waiting to take in\r\nany details of the stranger's appearance they fled noiselessly among\r\nthe trees, swerving to the left of the course they had intended to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThey ran until they were out of breath, glancing round fearfully every\r\nnow and again.  Had they been seen?  Would the savage pursue them?\r\nThere was no sign of pursuit, and when breathlessness forced them to\r\nwalk, they stepped out quickly, not daring to speak.\r\n\r\nThey were in a part of the island utterly unfamiliar to them.\r\nElizabeth had quite lost her bearings.  The vegetation was very thick;\r\neven where it was not actual forest there were bushes in clumps, large\r\ntangled masses of creepers, and briers which, as they forced their way\r\nthrough, tore their clothes and scratched their hands and faces.  They\r\nstumbled over obstacles at almost every step.  Here and there the\r\nground rose steeply, and the haste of their ascent made them pant for\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nAfter a time Elizabeth, always quickest to recover her self-possession,\r\nbegan to reproach herself for giving way so easily to panic.\r\n\r\n\"What an idiot I was!\" she said in a whisper.  \"The idea of running\r\nfrom a solitary creature!\"\r\n\r\n\"But he was a cannibal!\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"How do we know that?  Was he the owner of your little brown face,\r\nTommy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--no--I don't know,\" murmured Tommy.  \"I don't think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ought to have waited,\" continued Elizabeth.  \"We might at least have\r\nseen whether he was young or old.  Why, for all we know he is a white\r\nman, cast away like ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had no coat on, I saw that,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"He may be a native hermit, then.  There are such people among the\r\nsavages, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there may be hundreds,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Living in one little hut?  Nonsense!\"\r\n\r\n\"There may be other huts, we can't tell,\" said Mary.  \"The savage may\r\nhave been coming from one of the others.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true!  It is more likely that the man has companions, I admit.\r\nWell, if I can't pluck up courage to go among them, we must simply take\r\ncare to keep on our side of the island, and that means starvation in\r\ntime.  But where are we?  The sun is getting low: it will be dark soon.\r\nLet us run again.\"\r\n\r\nThey found themselves soon entering another patch of forest, and began\r\nto be seriously alarmed at the prospect of being overtaken by night\r\nbefore they reached home.\r\n\r\nElizabeth thought it best to keep straight on, for by so doing they\r\nmust come in time to the shore.  But it is difficult to judge direction\r\nin the forest, and when darkness descended upon them while they were\r\nstill among the trees, Elizabeth was forced to the conclusion that they\r\nhad been wandering round and round all the time.\r\n\r\n\"It's of no use, girls,\" she said; \"we can never find our way in the\r\ndark.  We shall have to stay here for the night.\"\r\n\r\nThey had been without food all day.  Utterly worn out by hunger,\r\nexertion and alarm, they huddled together at the foot of a tree and\r\nfell into an uneasy sleep.  Several times during the night they were\r\ndisturbed by slight noises in the brushwood around them, or in the\r\ntrees overhead.  But nothing happened to alarm them, and when dawn\r\nglimmered through the trees they rose, a haggard and sorry trio, and\r\nset off once more to find a way home.\r\n\r\nOnly a few minutes' walk uphill brought them to the ridge, from which\r\nthey could see the orange grove.  They were so desperately hungry and\r\nthirsty that they were ready to face all hazards for the sake of some\r\nfruit.  They hurried to the grove, snatched up a few oranges and\r\nbananas, and devoured them as they continued on their homeward way.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached their hut, their feeling of security was alloyed by\r\nthe distressing thought that they had lost their boat.  The savages,\r\nwhose settlement was near the cove at which they had landed, and who\r\nprobably appropriated the fruits of the cocoa-nut palms there, would\r\ncertainly discover the boat drawn up on the beach.  The girls had\r\nalways regarded it as a last refuge; they could always use it to row\r\nout to any ship that came reasonably near, if they failed to attract\r\nthe attention of those on board in any other way.  They felt that its\r\ndisappearance very likely doomed them to a lifelong imprisonment on the\r\nisland, and their hearts were heavy as lead.  Not being without\r\nimagination, they had often in their secret thoughts looked into the\r\nfuture, and seen themselves growing older, falling ill, one or the\r\nother of them dying; and the possibility of being the last survivor,\r\nshut up in this ocean prison-house without human companionship, filled\r\neach of them with terror.\r\n\r\nWith the morning common-sense asserted itself.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be perfect ninnies if we don't try to get back our boat,\"\r\nsaid Elizabeth.  \"I've been thinking a good deal in the night, and the\r\nmore I think the more convinced I am that there can't be many natives\r\non the island.  Why should they keep to themselves so?  Why don't they\r\never come to this part?  If only I could cease being a coward for five\r\nminutes I'd brave them.  Anyhow we ought to walk back to the place we\r\nlanded at yesterday and bring our boat away.  It mayn't have been\r\ndiscovered yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose it has been discovered?\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"They'd probably leave it on the shore.  If we walk over there this\r\nevening and get there about dark, we might steal it away.  It's our own\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to go near the place,\" said Tommy.  \"Besides, we might\r\nlose our way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if we walk over the cliffs,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"We have never\r\ntried that.  The woods are thick, but we might find the walk easier\r\nthan we think.  At any rate, it would be shorter than going all round\r\nby the ridge.  You see, Tommy, we need not go near the hut at all.\r\nDon't come if you feel nervous.  Mary and I can row the boat back.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't be left.  If you go I go too.  If we don't see the boat\r\nwhere we left it, you won't go any farther, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't if it is not in sight,\" said Elizabeth, \"but if it is anywhere\r\nwithin reach it would be silly not to try to get it.  We want some fish\r\nbadly.  Let's go fishing this morning, and rest all the afternoon, so\r\nas to be fresh for our walk.\"\r\n\r\nSo it was arranged, but the plan had to be modified.  While Tommy and\r\nMary were fishing from the rocks, it occurred to Elizabeth to climb to\r\nthe cliff top and see if the way she suggested was practicable.  She\r\nwas disappointed.  Not only was the forest dense, and the undergrowth\r\nan almost impenetrable mass of thorny thicket, but the ground was much\r\nbroken by fissures and small crevasses, so that, instead of being\r\neasier than the route across the island, this way promised to be longer\r\nand much more troublesome.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned to her sisters she found them cheerful over a finer\r\ncatch than usual.  Taking advantage of their high spirits she told them\r\nthe result of her expedition, and employed all her persuasiveness to\r\ninduce them to attempt the route by the ridge.  She overcame Tommy's\r\nreluctance, and then tactfully dropped the subject, hoping that the\r\nyoung girl's courage would not ooze away before it was time to start.\r\n\r\nAbout four o'clock, after making a good meal, they set off, Tommy\r\nexacting a promise that Elizabeth would turn back at the least sign of\r\ndanger.  They walked quickly until they had crossed the ridge; then,\r\navoiding the orange grove, they struck off more directly to the east,\r\nmoving more slowly, and with many a cautious glance around.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to come above the waterfall by and by,\" said Elizabeth in a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\nHer sense of locality had not deceived her.  In a few minutes they\r\nheard the musical plashing of the water.  Keeping this sound on their\r\nright, they went on, guessing that the native hut must be at some\r\ndistance below them, nearer the sea.  As they went on, in silence, they\r\ncame suddenly to what appeared to be the opening of a large cave in the\r\nface of the cliff.  They shrank back, wondering if this was a dwelling\r\nof some of the inhabitants; but taking courage from the perfect\r\nstillness they ventured to pass the opening and continued their descent\r\ntowards the sea.\r\n\r\nPresently, round a bend of the cliff, they saw the native hut, nestling\r\nat the foot of the rocky precipice, two or three hundred yards away.\r\nThe sun was very near its setting, and its last rays being intercepted\r\nby the high ground in the centre of the island, the light was already\r\ndim at the point at which they had arrived.  To gain the cove they\r\nwould have to descend a little lower and then cross through a clump of\r\ntrees.  As they approached this, Tommy, whose keen eyes were restlessly\r\nsearching the neighbourhood, declared that she had caught sight of a\r\nsmall figure flitting among the trees beyond the hut.  They all halted\r\nand gazed anxiously towards the spot she pointed out; but no form,\r\nhuman or otherwise, was now to be seen.  There was the hut just as they\r\nhad seen it before, but no person was visible, nor even the smoke of a\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nFearing that it would be quite dark before they reached the cove they\r\nhurried on.  The remaining distance was greater than Elizabeth had\r\nsupposed, and the clump of trees more extensive.  As they passed\r\nthrough this, the hut now being hidden from sight, they were more\r\ncircumspect than ever.  At last they reached the end of it, and halting\r\nfor another look round, they hastened on towards the sandy beach where\r\nthey had left the boat.\r\n\r\nIt was not many minutes before they saw, with a pang of disappointment,\r\nthat the boat was certainly not where it had been.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go back,\" whispered Tommy; \"you know you promised.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is no danger yet, child,\" replied Elizabeth somewhat\r\nimpatiently.  \"We might at least see if it is anywhere about.\"\r\n\r\nShe went on in advance of the others, and almost shouted for joy when\r\nshe caught sight of the boat drawn up in a snug little recess.  She\r\nbeckoned the girls to join her, and as they came up, pointed with some\r\nexcitement to a small native canoe that lay a few feet beyond their own\r\nboat.  Tommy gave a startled gasp.\r\n\r\n\"There are savages,\" she whispered; \"oh, do let us go.  I know we shall\r\nbe caught.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't go without the boat,\" said Elizabeth fiercely.  \"Quick!  It's\r\nbound to make a scraping sound as we drag it down; but it's very near\r\nthe water, and before any one can reach us from the hut we shall be\r\nafloat.\"\r\n\r\nWith nervous energy they drew the boat down to the water, sprang into\r\nit, and, in a state of fearful joy, Elizabeth began to pull from the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\"Steer close in, Tommy,\" she said, \"or we shall be in the current.\r\nThere's only half-an-hour of daylight left, but if I pull hard we shall\r\nbe home almost as soon as it is dark.  Mind the rocks.\"\r\n\r\nMary, the only unoccupied member of the party, kept her eyes fixed on\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\n\"I see some one,\" she called suddenly; \"there, just by those\r\ncocoa-nuts.\"\r\n\r\nTommy turned quickly.  In the gathering dusk she was unable at first to\r\nsee the object to which Mary pointed; but presently she distinguished,\r\npeeping round the stem of a palm not fifty yards away, a little brown\r\nface surmounted by a mop of very black hair.\r\n\r\n\"There it is,\" she cried, \"the same that I saw before.  Pull hard,\r\nBess; they'll be after us in their canoe.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth suspected that the native craft would be much speedier than\r\ntheir own little tub, and, fearful of pursuit, plied her sculls\r\nlustily.  As the boat drew away, the head moved; a shoulder appeared;\r\nthen a complete body, which came slowly down to the edge of the shore.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it's a girl!\" exclaimed Mary.\r\n\r\nBut in the fading light it was impossible to see distinctly, and they\r\nhad no temptation to delay, even though Mary's exclamation had aroused\r\ntheir curiosity.  The figure was soon completely out of sight.  Tommy\r\nhad to keep all her attention fixed on the task of steering, for they\r\nhad never rowed along this part of the shore, which was much broken by\r\nprojecting rocks.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure it was not the man we saw before?\" asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it was,\" said Mary.  \"It seemed smaller.  I wonder if it\r\nwas a girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are making surprising discoveries,\" said Elizabeth.  \"No one is\r\nchasing us, at any rate.  Can we have been scared all this time by a\r\ngirl?\"\r\n\r\nTommy said nothing.  The figure had appeared to be about her own\r\nheight.  Was it possible that the little brown face which had so much\r\nfrightened her, and which she had seen with horror in her dreams,\r\nbelonged to a young girl like herself?  She felt a strange longing to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDLING\r\n\r\nThe improvement in the weather was only temporary, and for several days\r\nthe girls were kept at home by the heavy rains.  They talked a good\r\ndeal about their discovery.  There appeared to be at least two natives\r\non the island; how many more they were unable to guess.  Having\r\nthemselves been seen, they felt that they could no longer owe their\r\nsafety to the ignorance of the inhabitants; but the bad weather might\r\ndiscourage any attempt to seek them out.  Whether they would escape\r\nattack when the rain ceased was a problem that caused much anxiety.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning a hurricane swept over the island, not so devastating\r\nas its predecessor, but violent enough to make them fear for the safety\r\nof their hut.  This time, however, the wind blew from a different\r\nquarter, and the girls' frail dwelling, being sheltered by the high\r\nground behind, escaped damage.  The storm lasted a few hours, and was\r\nthen succeeded by a day of brilliant sunshine.  The girls took\r\nadvantage of this to replenish their larder.  While Tommy and Elizabeth\r\nwere fishing, Mary posted herself as sentry to give the alarm if the\r\nnatives appeared.  They feared that the precaution would avail them\r\nlittle if they were really attacked, for they had no means of defence;\r\nbut it might at least give them time to escape for the moment by\r\nlaunching the boat.  They were undisturbed, however: and when the day\r\nclosed they rejoiced in one more respite.\r\n\r\nNext morning Tommy, on going down to the beach, was surprised to see a\r\ncanoe, apparently empty, drifting past the reef.  It flashed upon her\r\nthat this might be the canoe they had seen up the coast, and that it\r\nhad been washed away, like their own boat, by the recent storm.\r\n\r\nShe ran up to the hut to tell her sisters what she had seen, and all\r\nthree hurried down to the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Let's row out and catch it,\" cried Tommy excitedly.  \"I should love to\r\nlearn to paddle a native canoe, and I dare say in time we could make it\r\ngo along faster than our own dinghy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to capture an enemy's ship,\" said Elizabeth, with a smile.\r\n\"I don't see any reason why we shouldn't.  But we'll take some food and\r\nwater this time.  After our last adventure I don't care about voyaging\r\nwithout provisions.\"\r\n\r\nTommy ran back to the hut for some fruit and cold fish, while Mary\r\nfilled their water-pots at the stream.  Having placed them in the boat\r\nthey rowed out towards the reef.  By the time they were afloat the\r\ncanoe had drifted out into the main current, and was being carried\r\nrapidly away.  The sea was calm, and Elizabeth's vigorous strokes\r\nbrought the boat in twenty minutes or so within a few yards of the\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mary, who had been keeping a look-out in the boat, uttered a\r\nstartled exclamation.\r\n\r\n\"Bess, I believe there's some one lying in it.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth at once lay on her oars.\r\n\r\n\"Row back!\" whispered Tommy.  \"It's one of the savages.  He's hiding to\r\ndecoy us, or something.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth's common-sense asserted itself.\r\n\r\n\"That's not likely,\" she said.  \"How would he suppose that we should\r\nrow out?  and we couldn't get away now if we tried if he has a paddle.\r\nIf he hasn't he can't do us much harm.  Now's the best chance we have\r\nof making friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Bess!\" whispered Tommy anxiously, as Elizabeth dipped the oars\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth was firm, and with a few strokes brought the boat\r\nalongside the canoe.  Not a sound had come from it.\r\n\r\n\"It's a girl!\" exclaimed Mary, now that she could see more clearly the\r\nbottom of the canoe.\r\n\r\nTommy gave a gasp.  Was she to behold the owner of the little brown\r\nface at last?  Elizabeth no longer hesitated.  She drew close to the\r\ncanoe, shipped oars, and laid a hand on the side.\r\n\r\nThe girls looked down with a sort of awed curiosity.  In the bottom of\r\nthe boat lay a native girl--a brown-skinned pretty little creature,\r\nwith a string of what looked like teeth around her neck, and a yellow\r\nkerchief about her waist.  She was perfectly still; her eyes were\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\n\"She's dead!\" whispered Tommy, whose eyes were dilated with excitement.\r\n\r\nElizabeth leant over and placed her hand under the child's breast.\r\n\r\n\"No, she is alive,\" she said, \"but her heart is beating very faintly.\r\nSome water, Mary--quick!\"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible, placed as she was, to pour any water into the girl's\r\nmouth; but Elizabeth sprinkled a little on her head.  After a time the\r\ngirl stirred, opened her eyes and moved her lips, but no sound came\r\nfrom them, and in a moment her eyelids again drooped.\r\n\r\n\"She's absolutely done,\" said Elizabeth.  \"We'll tow the canoe home.\r\nTommy, fasten the painter.  The poor child's very bad.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat's head was turned, and Elizabeth rowed as hard as she could\r\nagainst the current.  Fortunately, they had not come very far beyond\r\nthe gap in the reef.  When the boat reached the still water it\r\ntravelled much faster, and within an hour of leaving they regained the\r\nshore.  During this time Tommy had thrown an occasional glance over her\r\nshoulder at the prostrate girl.  Once she caught the child's eyes fixed\r\nupon her, and felt a thrill as she recognized them; they were the same\r\nas she had seen peering at her out of the bush.  She felt no fear now,\r\nbut a longing to help the little stranger and know more about her.\r\n\r\nWhen they had landed and drawn the boat up, they lifted the girl and\r\ncarried her among them to the hut.  Her eyes opened during the journey,\r\nand she shivered; but she did not speak or struggle, and indeed hung so\r\nlimply in their arms that they feared she was past help.\r\n\r\n\"On my bed, please,\" said Tommy, when they reached the hut.\r\n\r\nThey laid her gently down, and Elizabeth poured a little cocoa-nut milk\r\nbetween her lips.  She now gave signs of animation, swallowed the juice\r\ngreedily, and looked with the eyes of a timid fawn from one to another\r\nof the three girls.  Presently she murmured a few words; her voice was\r\nplaintive and pleading.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be frightened,\" said Elizabeth soothingly.\r\n\r\nThe words seemed to startle the child.  She tried to rise, but was too\r\nweak to move.\r\n\r\n\"She must have been adrift a long time to be in this terrible state,\"\r\nsaid Elizabeth.  \"I wonder how it happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing,\" murmured Tommy.  \"What a sweet little face she has!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said Elizabeth, \"our voices frighten her.  Of course she\r\ndoesn't understand what we say.  I think you had better leave her to me\r\nfor a little while.  I'll feed her, and she'll see by and by that we\r\nmean her no harm.\"\r\n\r\nTommy's face wore for an instant a look of defiance, but she got the\r\nbetter of her inclination to rebel, and with Mary left the hut.\r\nElizabeth remained with the little stranger, feeding her at frequent\r\nintervals, bathing her head, occasionally murmuring a word of\r\nencouragement.  Her gentleness was effective.  Presently the look of\r\nfright vanished from the brown girl's eyes--large, liquid eyes that\r\nElizabeth found wonderfully attractive.  Once she timidly stroked\r\nElizabeth's strong firm hand, and at last, with a faint smile, she\r\ndropped off to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"She's asleep,\" said Elizabeth, quietly going forth to join her\r\nsisters.  \"What an extraordinary thing to happen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Bess,\" said Tommy fiercely, \"if you think you're going to\r\nkeep her to yourself you are jolly well mistaken.  I saw her first; you\r\nwouldn't believe me; and now I'm going to look after her, so there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Instead of the parrot?\" Mary could not help saying.\r\n\r\nElizabeth frowned at her.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, dear,\" she said pleasantly.  \"She's a little younger than\r\nyou, I should think, but I dare say she will like you to mother her.\r\nBut what will happen?  Won't her friends come and look for her?\"\r\n\r\n\"And if they do, and find we have treated her kindly, they'll just love\r\nus,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\nThe other girls were amazed at Tommy's complete change of attitude.\r\nHer fearfulness seemed to have been quite swallowed up in another\r\nemotion.  The discovery that the native of whom she had been so\r\nneedlessly frightened was a girl more helpless than herself filled her\r\nwith a kind of rapture.  She stepped softly into the hut, and seeing\r\nthat the child was still asleep, placed a peeled orange beside her mat,\r\nwhere it must be seen as soon as she awoke.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if we ought to go to the native hut and try to explain to her\r\npeople that the girl is safe,\" said Elizabeth, as they sat on the grass\r\neating their dinner.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said Tommy decisively.  \"I dare say they were cruel to\r\nher, and the poor thing was glad to get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"What an imagination you have!\" said Elizabeth, smiling.  \"For all you\r\nknow, her mother may be broken-hearted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it.  Anyhow, she's too weak to go home, and we shall\r\nsoon see if she wants to.  I'll talk to her by and by, and I know\r\nshe'll be quite pleased to stay with us.\"\r\n\r\nRemembering Tommy's ill-success with the parrot, the elder girls were\r\namused at her confident belief that she would make the child talk, and\r\nunderstand what she said.  Indeed, when, later in the day, the girl\r\nawoke, and Tommy went to attend to her, the first attempt at opening\r\ncommunications was a complete failure.  By way of putting the little\r\npatient at her ease, Tommy grinned at her, patted her head, nodded,\r\npointed to herself and said \"Me Tommy,\" with the result that the child\r\nshrank away from her as if scared.  When she realized that she had\r\nnothing to fear, she gazed upon the white girl with wide-open eyes and\r\nthe same wondering look as may be seen on the face of a child watching\r\na conjurer.\r\n\r\nThe ravenous way in which she ate the food given to her confirmed the\r\ngirls' belief that she was half-starved.  She rapidly gained strength,\r\nand it became clear that her weakness was due to hunger and not to\r\nillness.  She began to talk, pouring out her words in liquid tones that\r\nfell pleasantly on the English ears.  When she saw how puzzled the\r\ngirls were she laughed; then, with a sober look of reflection, pointed\r\nto herself and said \"Me Tommee\" so drolly that the girls screamed with\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nJust before sunset, when the girls came into the hut for the night,\r\nthey sat eating their supper and talking about their dusky guest.  She\r\nknew by instinct that she was the subject of their conversation, and\r\nlooked timidly from one to another, watching their lips, her features\r\nreflecting every expression on their faces.\r\n\r\nTommy gave her some baked fish for supper, and then prepared to \"tuck\r\nher up,\" as she said, with her own wraps; but the girl rejected the\r\ncovering and coiled herself up like a dog.\r\n\r\nNext morning she got up and followed them when they went down to the\r\nshore for their usual bath.  She seemed to be astonished at the\r\nwhiteness of their skin, and amused them very much by scrubbing herself\r\nwith sand, to see if she could make her brown body resemble theirs.\r\nShe watched every detail of their toilet with intense interest, and\r\nwhen she saw them comb their hair she held out her hand for the comb.\r\n\r\n\"Don't give it to her, Tommy,\" said Mary, looking with distaste at the\r\ngirl's greasy mop.\r\n\r\n\"Rubbish!\" said Tommy.  \"We can wash it afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nBut even Tommy regretted her generosity when, after being vigorously\r\ntugged through the thick matted hair, the comb was restored to her with\r\nseveral of its teeth missing.\r\n\r\n\"My word!\" she exclaimed.  \"Fancy breaking wooden teeth!  My poor old\r\npony's mane was nothing to her thatch.\"\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the girl followed them about like a dog.  They noticed\r\nthat she looked about her eagerly, as though searching for some\r\nrecognizable landmark.  But she evinced no desire to leave them, and\r\nindeed soon became tired; her strength was not yet equal to much\r\nexertion.  The girls all sat on the grass with the child in the midst.\r\n\r\n\"Let's try to find out her name,\" suggested Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Let me try,\" said Tommy.  Pointing to Elizabeth, she said \"Bess,\"\r\nrepeating the name several times.  Then she touched Mary, pronouncing\r\nher name, and lastly herself.\r\n\r\n\"Me Tommee,\" said the girl, laughing delightedly.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" said her instructor, \"not 'me,' just Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me Tommee,\" repeated the girl; then after a moment pointed to Mary,\r\nsaying \"Mailee,\" and to Elizabeth, calling her \"Bess,\" with a long\r\nsibilant.\r\n\r\n\"Now you,\" said Tommy, pointing to the girl herself.\r\n\r\nShe at once recognized what was required and said, \"Fangati.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pretty name!\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how she spells it,\" remarked Mary.\r\n\r\nAt this Tommy shrieked.\r\n\r\n\"She doesn't spell at all, you goose!\" she said; \"of course she never\r\nlearnt her letters.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the laugh was on Mary's side, for Fangati, as if thoroughly\r\nenjoying the fun, touched Tommy's hand, saying \"Me Tommee,\" over and\r\nover again.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be 'Me Tommee' always now,\" said Elizabeth.  \"You should have\r\nused correct English, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" said Tommy philosophically.  \"Anyhow, she can't say\r\nMary.  Try again, Fangati,\" she added, pointing to her sister.\r\n\r\n\"Mailee,\" cried the child, showing her teeth in a pretty smile.  \"Bess,\r\nMailee, Me Tommee.\"\r\n\r\nTo make quite sure that they had her name correctly, Tommy walked to a\r\nlittle distance until she was out of sight among the trees, and then\r\ncalled \"Fangati!\" in her shrill treble.  The girl instantly jumped to\r\nher feet, and ran after her.\r\n\r\n\"Well done,\" said Tommy, patting her.  \"You are a perfect dear, and I'm\r\ngoing to be very fond of you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nANOTHER BROWN FACE\r\n\r\nThe girls were much surprised that Fangati seemed perfectly content to\r\nremain with them, and showed no disposition to return to her friends.\r\nAt first they put this down to lack of strength, thinking that the\r\nchild had the prudence not to attempt to cross the island until there\r\nwas no risk of breaking down.  But in a few days, when Fangati was as\r\nvigorous and lively as a healthy young animal, this explanation was no\r\nlonger tenable.\r\n\r\nThey were almost equally surprised that, so far as they could tell, no\r\nsearch had been made for her.  For some days they kept pretty close to\r\nthe neighbourhood of the hut, in some fear that their possession of\r\nFangati might turn to their disadvantage if the natives discovered her.\r\nTo be suspected of kidnapping her might bring down upon them the wrath\r\nof her friends.  But when everything went on as before, they lost their\r\ntimidity, and made longer and longer excursions from the hut.\r\n\r\nFangati accompanied them everywhere.  They had taught her a few words,\r\nand could make her understand by signs or otherwise what they wanted\r\nher to do.  Their life was so simple that there were few ways in which\r\nshe could help them.  She laughed when she saw their manner of fishing,\r\nbut did not offer to show them the native method.  She was content with\r\nthings as they were.\r\n\r\nOne day when she had gone with them into the woodland to fetch food,\r\nshe gathered a number of large yellowish-green fruits which they girls\r\nhad often looked at longingly but which they had never ventured to eat\r\nfor fear of poison.  She handed the fruit to them, and made signs to\r\nthem to eat.  Seeing their hesitation, she dug her strong teeth into\r\nthe hard rind, quickly pulled it off, and showing the juicy pulp,\r\nbright yellow in colour, began to suck it with enjoyment.  At this the\r\ngirls followed her example.\r\n\r\n\"It is delicious,\" cried Tommy, the juice dripping from her lips.\r\n\"What donkeys we were not to try it before!  The bother is, there isn't\r\nenough of it; there's a monstrous big stone in the middle.  I wonder\r\nwhat it is?\"\r\n\r\nThe fruit was the mango, which they had known hitherto only in the\r\nbottles of chutney which their uncle had brought from India.  Their\r\npleasure at the discovery of a new fruit impelled Fangati to make\r\nfurther additions to their menu.  As they passed through the woodland\r\non their way home, she stopped among some creepers trailing along the\r\nground, seized a stick, and began to dig with it.  The girls watched\r\nher curiously.  After a little she turned up some tubers that looked\r\nsomething like potatoes, and lifted them, chattering incomprehensibly,\r\nand pointing to her mouth.\r\n\r\n\"I believe they are yams,\" said Mary; \"they are very good to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll boil some for dinner,\" said Elizabeth.  \"What a useful\r\nlittle thing Fangati is turning out!\"\r\n\r\nThey took home a few of the roots, and came back in the afternoon with\r\nthe boat-hook, with which, however, they dug up the roots no faster\r\nthan Fangati with the stick.\r\n\r\nAnother day, when they went for cocoanuts and failed to find any on the\r\nground, Fangati pointed to some nuts clustering among the foliage fifty\r\nfeet above the ground, and made signs to them to climb up for them.\r\nThey shook their heads, whereupon she laughed, ran to one of the trees,\r\nclasped her hands about the slender stem, and began, as it seemed to\r\nthe girls, to walk up it.  They held their breath as she nimbly\r\nmounted, and were not easy in mind until, after throwing down several\r\nnuts, she slid to the ground again, laughing with glee.\r\n\r\n\"Her backbone must be made of india-rubber,\" declared Tommy.  \"I must\r\ntry that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't allow it,\" said Elizabeth firmly.  \"It's not worth while\r\nto risk a broken back.  Fangati can get us all we want.\"\r\n\r\nFangati introduced them to several other edible plants, of which they\r\nnever learnt the English names.  The greater variety of food was very\r\nacceptable, and though their health had been good, except for Mary's\r\ntouch of fever, they all declared that they felt better than ever since\r\nFangati came.  No doubt they owed as much to their new interest in life\r\nas to their change of food.\r\n\r\nThey had not of late walked to the ridge.  But one day when the oranges\r\nnear them had given out, they decided to make an excursion to the\r\norange grove where Tommy had first seen Fangati.  When they came near\r\nthe crest a sudden change in Fangati's demeanour astonished them.\r\nHitherto she had been as merry as possible, finding cause for laughter\r\nin everything.  But all at once she stopped dead, gave a cry, uttered\r\nthe word \"tapu,\" and fled away with every sign of terror.\r\n\r\nThe girls were amazed at her alarm, and looked about for some\r\nexplanation of it, half expecting to see some hideous savage\r\napproaching with uplifted club.  But all that was in sight were the\r\nunvarying features of the landscape, and the row of posts with their\r\nrags of pennants.\r\n\r\nThey hurried after Fangati, and tried with the little stock of native\r\nwords she had taught them, and the few English words she had learnt, to\r\nelicit the explanation of her terror.  She explained fluently enough,\r\nbut the only word they caught, because of its constant repetition, was\r\n\"tapu.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the same as taboo, I think,\" said Mary.  \"It means something\r\nsacred, but I can't make out what could be sacred there.  It's so\r\nstrange, too, because we were quite near the orange grove, and she was\r\nnot frightened then--unless she was frightened of you, Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say she was,\" said Tommy; \"we were both frightened, but we are\r\ngood friends now, aren't we, Fangati?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me Tommee plend,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Are we going back without any oranges?\" asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"Why should we?\" exclaimed Tommy.  \"Come along, Fangati.\"\r\n\r\nShe led the way towards the ridge again, but Fangati stood and waved\r\nher arms, crying \"tapu\" again and again.\r\n\r\n\"Evidently she won't cross the ridge,\" said Elizabeth; \"but we can get\r\nto the orange grove by going round.  Perhaps she will come with us\r\nthen.\"\r\n\r\nStriking off at an angle with the ridge, they found that Fangati\r\naccompanied them willingly.  She soon recovered her wonted high\r\nspirits.  They made their way through the undergrowth, and presently\r\ncame to an open glade, beyond which lay the orange grove.\r\n\r\nHere they were again surprised to see signs of great excitement in\r\nFangati's face.  The girl stood still for a few moments, looking about\r\nher eagerly; then, uttering a little cry, she darted away, and in a\r\nsecond or two was lost to view.\r\n\r\n\"Now what's that mean?\" cried Mary.\r\n\r\n\"There's only one explanation,\" said Elizabeth.  \"She recognizes the\r\nplace as being near her home, and she has run away to her friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! what idiots we are!\" cried Tommy.  \"This was the last place we\r\nshould have brought her to.  Now we've lost her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dear,\" said Elizabeth, \"I have often wondered whether we were\r\nright in keeping her.  She belongs to her own people, you know, and not\r\nto us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she didn't want to leave us.  And they don't care a dump about\r\nher, or they'd have come for her long before this.  I'm sure she was\r\nmuch happier with us than with nasty savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet she has left us now,\" remarked Mary.  \"They can't be dreadfully\r\nhorrid to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you fetch her back, Bess?\" asked Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't much care about it,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"After all, we\r\ndon't know what trouble we might be running into.  Perhaps she will\r\ncome back to us herself.\"\r\n\r\nAfter taking some oranges they returned to their own side of the island\r\nby way of the ridge.  Tommy was disconsolate.  All the sisters had\r\nbecome fond of Fangati, but there was a special tie between her and\r\nTommy, and she was more often with Tommy than with the others.\r\n\r\nFor the next two days they talked about little else than Fangati's\r\ndefection.  They walked up to the orange grove, in the hope that she\r\nwould reappear, but returned without a sight of the little brown face\r\nthey had learned to love.  Her departure had left a strange blank; they\r\nfelt that something had gone out of their life.  Until then they had\r\nnot realized how much she had added to their happiness.\r\n\r\nOn the third morning after breakfast they were \"washing-up\" outside the\r\nhut--so they called the clearing away of banana skins, fish bones, and\r\npieces of shell--when they suddenly caught sight of two figures moving\r\namong the trees some little distance away.  They sprang to their feet\r\nin alarm.  A second glance told them that the figures were those of\r\nnatives; and, struck with the idea, that the savages were stealthily\r\napproaching to attack them, they began to run up-stream toward a patch\r\nof thick undergrowth where they could hide.\r\n\r\nBut they had only taken a few paces when there was a shrill cry of \"Me\r\nTommee!\"  They halted hesitatingly, to see Fangati flying towards them,\r\nand her companion standing still at the edge of the woodland.\r\n\r\nWhen Fangati was within a few yards, Tommy, able to restrain herself no\r\nlonger, rushed forward and clasped the brown girl in her arms, kissing\r\nher again and again.  Fangati laughed; she laughed at everything; then,\r\nhand in hand with Tommy, ran to the other girls, chattering excitedly.\r\nShe pointed to the solitary native, who had not moved, smiled, patted\r\nher own head, threw herself down and clasped Elizabeth's feet, ran a\r\nlittle way, and then came back looking behind her.\r\n\r\n\"I think she wants to know if she may bring this other one,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"And she wants to make us understand that we shan't be harmed,\" said\r\nTommy.  \"Let her go, Bess.\"\r\n\r\n\"We gain nothing by refusing, so she may as well,\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nShe waved her hands toward the second native, and Fangati, who had been\r\nwatching her wistfully, bounded off with a gay laugh.\r\n\r\nThe girls awaited her return with mixed feelings.  They were glad to\r\nsee Fangati again, but they did not much desire the acquaintance of a\r\nstrange native.  They did not yet know whether it was a man or woman.\r\nThis doubt, however, was resolved in a few minutes.  Scanning the\r\napproaching couple anxiously, they saw that Fangati's companion was a\r\ngrey, shrunken old man, apparently feeble, for he moved slowly and\r\nleant on the girl for support.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it's the man we saw at the native hut,\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Not much to be afraid of, after all,\" said Tommy.  \"He looks hardly\r\nstrong enough to kill a fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"How shall we speak to him?\" said Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\"It will be rather a pantomime,\" rejoined Tommy.  \"Be very grave and\r\ndignified, Bess.  Impress him with your importance, Queen Bess, monarch\r\nof all she surveys.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous, Tommy,\" said Elizabeth, feeling it was no time\r\nfor jesting.  The old man certainly looked harmless enough, but she was\r\nby no means easy in mind.\r\n\r\nAfter what seemed a long time, Fangati led the man up to the girls.\r\n\r\n\"Bess, Mailee, Me Tommee,\" she said, pointing to each in turn.\r\n\r\nThe old man made a salutation, and the girls looked at him with\r\ninterest.  His face and every visible part of his body was hideously\r\ntattooed, his thin bare legs looking as if they were covered with\r\nindigo-blue stockings.  A stick was thrust cross-wise through his mop\r\nof grizzled hair.  Certainly he was not a prepossessing object.\r\n\r\nThe girls were wondering what they ought to do, when they were\r\nsurprised to hear the man address them.\r\n\r\n\"I speak Inglis,\" he said; \"I Maku.  Good-day all-same velly much.\"\r\n\r\nTommy turned aside so that her smile should not irritate or offend.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, with admirable composure, said--\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Mr. Maku!  Fangati is your granddaughter, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\nIt was at once clear that Maku's English was not very abundant.  The\r\nword grand-daughter puzzled him.  He looked at Fangati dully; then his\r\neyes suddenly brightened.\r\n\r\n\"Fangati, he my son chile,\" he said.  \"He velly good chile.  He get\r\nplenty piecee me eat.  To-mollow he go; I velly solly, eh! eh!  I cly.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth in her turn was puzzled, and it was Mary who first saw the\r\nold man's meaning.\r\n\r\n\"He says that Fangati got him plenty to eat, but disappeared one day,\r\nand he was very sorry, and cried.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder, poor old man!\" cried Tommy.  \"He looks half-starved.\r\nThere's no one else living in their hut, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you wife, children, friends?\" asked Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Wife he dead long-timey.  Chil'en big long way.\"  He waved his arm to\r\nindicate distance.  \"Plen: ah! mikinaly he plen; he all-same gone away;\r\neh! eh! all-same dead.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this Mary made out that he had a missionary friend who had gone\r\naway and might now be dead.\r\n\r\nA few more questions satisfied the girls that, as far as he knew, there\r\nwere no more natives on the island except himself and his\r\ngranddaughter.  Intensely relieved on this score, they were ready to be\r\nhospitable, and to Fangati's delight, invited the man to come towards\r\ntheir hut and talk to them.\r\n\r\nSeated on the ground in front of the hut with the girls in the\r\nentrance, the old man related a story of which they understood little\r\nat the time.  It was some few days before Mary, thinking over what he\r\nhad said, and puzzling about it, arrived at something like a coherent\r\nnarrative.  Even then she was only partially successful.  What he had\r\ntried to explain in his scanty English was as follows.\r\n\r\nHe had been chief of a small island a day's paddling to the eastward.\r\nIt was remote from the usual trade-tracks, and for this reason had\r\nremained longer in heathendom and cannibalism than most of the Pacific\r\nIslands.  But a white missionary had at last come and taken up his\r\nabode on the island, by whose skill in medicine, earnest teaching, and\r\nnoble character, Maku and some of his sons had been won over.\r\n\r\nThere were certain soothsayers among the people, who hated the new\r\nteacher when they found their influence with the chief gone.  Working\r\non the superstitions of the islanders, they secretly stirred up a\r\nrevolt.  But for the quickness of Fangati he would have been attacked\r\nand killed.  She discovered what was going on, informed her\r\ngrandfather, and persuaded him to put to sea by night in a canoe, with\r\nthe intention of paddling to an island to the southward, where Maku\r\nwould find friends.  Forced out of their course by wind and current,\r\nthey were nearly exhausted when by good fortune they found themselves\r\non the shore of this island.  They landed, erected a hut, and had since\r\nlived there, not caring to risk another voyage, and finding abundance\r\nof food.\r\n\r\nMaku could not say how long he had been on the island, nor were the\r\ngirls able to discover whether his arrival had preceded or succeeded\r\ntheirs.  He told them that one day Fangati, who had been to gather\r\nfruit, reported that she had seen white people.  Though he thought she\r\nmust be mistaken, he bade her run away at once if she saw any one\r\nagain, white or brown.  He did not like white people.  Since they came\r\nto the Pacific the brown people had not been happy.  They had been\r\nforced to work; some had been taken from their own islands and carried\r\naway to toil on distant plantations; new diseases had been brought\r\namong them.  He had one friend among the white people--the \"mikinaly\";\r\nhe was a good man and did good things.  He had taught Maku English.\r\n\r\nTrue, Fangati had said that the strangers she had seen were women; but\r\nMaku could not believe that white women could have come to this island\r\nwithout white men.  And he was desperately afraid of being betrayed to\r\nthe ill-disposed mystery men among his own people; for before he had\r\nbeen long on the island he discovered that it was the scene of certain\r\nceremonies conducted by these mystery men.  At long intervals, before\r\nhe became a Christian, he had himself accompanied his people in solemn\r\nexpeditions to the island.  The accession of a new chief was celebrated\r\nwith special rites; years and years before, in his heathen days, his\r\nown accession had been marked by a great cannibal feast.  He was much\r\nafraid that white people might sell him to his revolted tribesmen, who\r\nwould make him a victim.\r\n\r\nWhen Fangati disappeared he was convinced that she had been captured by\r\nthe white people, and he would never see her again.  He missed her very\r\nmuch, for, being old and infirm, he depended almost entirely on her for\r\nhis food.  But when she suddenly returned and told him how she had been\r\ncarried out to sea while fishing, and how the white women had rescued\r\nher and treated her kindly, he felt that he must make his presence\r\nknown to them, and especially warn them of their danger.\r\n\r\nAt this Elizabeth asked anxiously what danger was likely to assail\r\nthem.  The man hesitated.  Now that it had come to the point he seemed\r\nto be unwilling to say more.  But at length he explained that the spot\r\nat which they had landed was the usual landing-place of his people when\r\nthey came to visit the island, and all the ground between it and the\r\nridge was tapu.  He struggled with his imperfect English in trying to\r\nmake clear to the girls what that meant.  They understood at last that\r\ntheir side of the island was sacred; its grounds were only to be\r\ntrodden when the people came to hold their ceremonies, and anybody\r\ntrespassing upon it would incur the wrath of the mystery men, and bring\r\ndown upon themselves a terrible punishment.  The forbidden ground was\r\nmarked off from the rest of the island by a line of poles set upon the\r\nridge.  Maku confessed that he himself felt very uneasy at having\r\nviolated the tapu; and Elizabeth, questioning him, found that beneath\r\nhis recently assumed Christianity there lay a deep stratum of\r\nsuperstition.  When the \"mikinaly\" was with him tapu had no horrors for\r\nhim; but the missionary had left his island some time before the rising\r\ntook place, and with the removal of his influence the chief had\r\nrelapsed to some extent into the superstitions of his early manhood.\r\n\r\nThe girls were not at first much alarmed at what he told them.  But\r\nwhen he added that his people would certainly choose another chief in\r\nhis place, and come to the island for the usual inaugural ceremonies,\r\nthe thought of being discovered by the savages at such a time filled\r\nthem with dread.  Their hut lay in the direct path of the procession to\r\nthe ridge; it could not escape detection, and they trembled at the idea\r\nof falling into the hands of people who might be worked up to religious\r\nfrenzy by their mystery men.  To violate the tapu would be bad enough\r\nfor a brown man; it would be worse for white people.\r\n\r\nMaku made a suggestion.  Let them dismantle the hut, he said, destroy\r\nall traces of their occupation, and remove to the other side of the\r\nisland, where at least they would not have to reckon with the anger of\r\nthe mystery men at finding them on forbidden ground.  The girls\r\ndiscussed the suggestion earnestly, and decided to follow his advice.\r\nIt gave them a pang to pull down the little home to which they had\r\nbecome accustomed: but they lost no time in setting about it, carrying\r\nthe material down to the boat.  Meanwhile, the old man and Fangati\r\nscattered the stones of their oven, and tried to obliterate the signs\r\nof habitation.  Maku shook his head when he saw the bleached grass on\r\nwhat had been the floor of the hut.  Even in this land of quick growth\r\nit must take some time before so tell-tale an evidence was done away.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that Elizabeth and Mary should row the boat round to\r\nMaku's landing-place with the canoe in tow, while Tommy walked with the\r\nold man across the island.  The chief did not follow the long route up\r\nthe stream by which the girls had reached the ridge, but took a more\r\nslanting course through a wild and rugged region which they had never\r\nexplored.  As they were crossing the ridge he pointed out to Tommy in\r\nthe distance the entrance to the great cave in which the ceremonies of\r\nhis tribe were conducted.  Tommy shivered; the thought of wild men\r\nengaged in mysterious rites terrified her imagination.  Choosing a\r\nsteep path that wound down the eastern side of the ridge, Maku led the\r\ntwo young girls to the open space near the waterfall, and in a few\r\nminutes reached his hut.  He and Fangati at once began to rig up near\r\nby a temporary shelter for the English girls, and it was almost\r\nfinished by the time Elizabeth and Mary arrived.\r\n\r\nThe girls were provided by their new friends with an excellent meal of\r\nfish, breadfruit and other fruits, some of which were strange to them.\r\nImmediately afterwards, Maku and his granddaughter set to work to build\r\nthem a hut in the native fashion.  Elizabeth doubted whether they would\r\nlike a house which must be inevitably close and stuffy with a doorway\r\nonly high enough to crawl through.  Their own hut had been fresh and\r\nbreezy.  But it seemed better to let the natives have their way.  They\r\nwould build much faster than the English girls; and if strange natives\r\nshould make their appearance in this part of the island, they would not\r\nbe rendered suspicious as they might be if they saw a hut so different\r\nfrom what they were accustomed to.\r\n\r\nThe girls slept in their temporary shelter that night.  They had lost\r\ntheir fear of savage neighbours, but this had been replaced by a new\r\nfear of possible visitors from beyond.  Tommy had asked Maku during\r\ntheir walk whether there was any chance of a ship coming to the island.\r\n\r\n\"No ship,\" he answered.  \"No come this side.  Melican ship come one\r\ntime, my place; mikinaly come in Melican ship; all-same, no mo'e.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE SHARK\r\n\r\nThe change of circumstances pleased every one except Billy the parrot.\r\nHe had never taken kindly to Fangati, but had always ruffled his\r\nfeathers and squawked angrily when he saw her with Tommy.  The girls\r\nlaughed at these manifestations of jealousy.  But when Billy was\r\nremoved from his home, and found that his mistress's attentions were\r\nshared by still another person, he became sulky.  He would sit on a\r\nrock, or the bough of a tree, blinking his bead-like eyes and\r\nmaintaining a sullen and reproachful silence.\r\n\r\nTommy was so much taken up with Fangati that it is to be feared she\r\nsomewhat neglected her old favourite, as was perfectly natural under\r\nthe circumstances.  When Fangati and her grandfather had finished the\r\nnew hut, which occupied them only two days, the young girls were\r\nconstantly together.  Tommy, now that her fear of cannibal neighbours\r\nwas removed, became again the active, light-hearted, adventurous girl\r\nshe had ever been.  She roamed all over the island with Fangati, not\r\neven excepting the region of the tapu, for she found that the native\r\ngirl was ready to go in any direction, provided she did not catch sight\r\nof the posts on the ridge.  They discovered in company other\r\nplantations of wholesome fruits, of kinds which Tommy already knew, and\r\nof others which were strange to her.  Fangati showed her how to fish in\r\nthe native way with a spear of sharpened wood.  At first Tommy was\r\nsceptical about this, declaring that with the line and hook she would\r\ncatch more fish than Fangati with the spear.  But she soon found that\r\nshe was quite wrong.  Leaning over the edge of a rock, with her keen\r\neyes fixed on the water, Fangati would plunge her spear rapidly, and\r\nscarcely ever failed to bring up a fish as large as Tommy caught, and\r\nmuch more quickly.  Tommy tried to imitate her, and was exceedingly\r\nproud when, after dozens of fruitless attempts, she succeeded in\r\nspearing her first fish.\r\n\r\nIn the course of one of their early rambles the girls came to the pit\r\ninto which Tommy had fallen.  Fangati was much interested in this,\r\nhaving never seen it before, and she ran to fetch her grandfather to\r\nthe spot.  The girls asked him what was the purpose of the pit, and he\r\nthought at first that it had been dug as a storehouse for breadfruit.\r\nBut when Tommy told him about the tunnel through which she had crawled,\r\nand of the hole in the wall at the farther end, he looked puzzled and\r\ndeclared that he would go down and see for himself.  It did not take\r\nlong to construct a serviceable ladder with stout canes bound together\r\nwith creepers, and the whole party descended into the pit and followed\r\nTommy through the tunnel.\r\n\r\nArriving at the end, Maku looked curiously over the ledge.  He\r\nexplained to the girls that the dim-lit space beyond was the cave in\r\nwhich the mystic ceremonies of his people were conducted.  The reason\r\nof the existence of the pit was now plain to him.  There was a\r\ntradition among his tribe that one of his predecessor chiefs had shown\r\nan extraordinary knowledge of some of the secret performances of the\r\nmystery men at which he had not been present.\r\n\r\n\"I unastan,\" said Maku.  \"He find hole; he look; oh! he say, dis fine\r\nplace fo' me.  All-same he makee way dis side; makee pit; come 'long,\r\nlisten, look see; eh, eh; he know all-same too much.\"\r\n\r\nHis explanation was not very clear, but after a time the girls\r\nunderstood that the former chief, having accidentally discovered the\r\ntunnel opening to the cave, had dug the pit so that he could approach\r\nit from the inland direction, and had thus provided himself with a\r\nmeans of eavesdropping.  Apparently he had covered the pit with a light\r\nlattice-work--as the breadfruit pit was usually covered--and this in\r\nthe course of years had become overgrown with vegetation, so that\r\nnobody could have suspected the hole beneath.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the surface they pulled up the ladder and laid it among\r\nthe trees near by.  More than once during the succeeding days Tommy and\r\nFangati amused themselves by descending into the pit and chasing each\r\nother in the darkness of the tunnel.  They invented other amusements.\r\nTommy ran races with Fangati, played at hide-and-seek in the woods,\r\npractised shying at cocoa-nuts.  All the girls had swimming\r\ncompetitions in the cove at low tide, and though the English girls\r\nbecame very expert, they were no match for Fangati, who dived and\r\ngambolled in the water as though in her native element.\r\n\r\nIn constant companionship with Fangati, they learnt in course of time\r\nmany native words, and she on her side picked up a smattering of\r\nEnglish.  They were thus able to communicate with her freely.  She\r\namused them by her mispronunciations.  The letter r was a\r\nstumbling-block.  \"Run\" was always \"lun\"; \"bekfas leady,\" she would\r\nsay; and she adopted from her grandfather the expression \"all-same,\"\r\nwhich she used frequently and in odd connections.\r\n\r\n\"I lun all-same kick, Me Tommee,\" she would say, when Tommy had beaten\r\nher in a race; or if, in a game of hide-and-seek, it was Mary's turn to\r\nhide, \"Mailee all-same hidee-sik,\" was her way of putting it.\r\n\r\nOne day, having had no success at their usual fishing-place at the\r\nmouth of the cove, Fangati proposed that she and Tommy should go to a\r\nspot about half-a-mile up the coast, where she had sometimes caught\r\nfish before the girls came.  Elizabeth had laid no restrictions on\r\nTommy as regards her fishing excursions, except that she had asked her\r\nnot to go out of sight of their little harbour.  Remembering how\r\nFangati had been carried out to sea, she wished to guard against any\r\nrepetition of that mishap.\r\n\r\nThe spot to which Fangati pointed was beyond the usual limit.  It was\r\nnot, however, far distant from the shore, and Fangati had been much\r\nfarther out when her canoe was caught by the current.  Elizabeth had\r\ngone with Mary into the interior to gather breadfruit, so that it was\r\nimpossible to consult her; and Tommy, anxious to have some fish for\r\ndinner by the time her sisters returned, agreed to try the new place.\r\n\r\nThey reached it in the canoe, Tommy paddling.  It was a large flat rock\r\na few hundred yards from the shore, with a deep pool on its inner side.\r\nThere they had great success, in the course of half-an-hour spearing\r\nenough fish for several meals.  Thoroughly satisfied, they had just\r\nturned their canoe towards home when Tommy caught sight of a large\r\nshape moving rapidly beneath the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! what's that?\" she cried.\r\n\r\nAlmost before the words were out of her mouth the canoe quivered under\r\na terrific shock.  Then it was rocked violently to and fro, so\r\nviolently that the sea came over the gunwale and the girls had to throw\r\nthemselves on to the opposite side to prevent the slight craft from\r\noverturning.  As they did this there was a sudden sharp sound as of\r\nsomething snapping.  Instantly the canoe turned over, and the girls\r\nfound themselves in the sea.\r\n\r\nFangati laughed.\r\n\r\n\"All-same jolly fun,\" she said.\r\n\r\nTommy was not so much amused.  Being able to swim she did not mind the\r\nsudden bath; but all the fish were gone; the morning's work was thrown\r\naway.\r\n\r\nFangati quickly righted the canoe, and having clambered into it, helped\r\nTommy to regain her place.  There was, of course, a quantity of water\r\nat the bottom of the little vessel.\r\n\r\n\"What was it?\" exclaimed Tommy, shaking the water from her head.  \"Was\r\nit a shark?\"\r\n\r\nFangati looked about her.  In a moment she pointed to a strange object,\r\nsomething like the end of a saw, projecting from the bottom of the\r\ncanoe.  Tommy had never seen such a thing before.  Stooping down, she\r\npulled at it.  It was loosely fixed, and came away in her hand.\r\nInstantly there was an inrush of water.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, silly Billy,\" cried Fangati, using an expression she had heard\r\nTommy apply to the parrot.\r\n\r\nShe snatched the broken sword of the sword-fish from Tommy's hand, and\r\ntried to replace it.  But though she succeeded in wedging it into the\r\nwood, it failed to stop the hole entirely.  Without loss of time she\r\nseized her paddle and started for the shore, about a quarter of a mile\r\ndistant.  But the canoe had shipped a considerable quantity of water,\r\nand this was being continually increased by the inflow through the\r\nleak.  It sunk lower and lower, and every minute answered less readily\r\nto Fangati's paddle.  It soon became clear to the girls that the canoe\r\nmust sink long before they reached the shore.  They could easily gain\r\nthe land by swimming, but the canoe could not be recovered if it sank.\r\n\r\nBetween them and the shore a rock stood just above the surface.  It was\r\nonly about a hundred yards away, and Fangati, exerting all her\r\nstrength, drove the canoe towards it, and reached it in the nick of\r\ntime.  In another few seconds the canoe must have foundered.\r\n\r\nThere was not much room on the rock.  Tommy scrambled on to it, while\r\nFangati, slipping over into the sea, prepared to help Tommy drag the\r\ncanoe up, so that they might tilt the water out of it, and try to stop\r\nthe leak with a handkerchief, or a part of Tommy's skirt.\r\n\r\nThey had just begun to tilt the canoe when Tommy caught sight of a\r\nsmall dark object on the surface of the sea about thirty or forty yards\r\naway.  It was the fin of a shark.\r\n\r\n\"Fangati, quick!\" she called, holding out her hands to help the girl\r\nclamber on to the rock.\r\n\r\nFangati's back was towards the shark and she did not understand what\r\nthe peril was.  But the note of terror in Tommy's voice alarmed her.\r\nShe let go her hold of the canoe, gained the edge of the rock in two\r\nstrokes, and with Tommy's help scrambled up just as the shark glided\r\npast into the deep water beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Eh!  Eh!\" exclaimed Fangati, when she saw the reason of Tommy's\r\nfright.  \"I no aflaid, what fo' aflaid of he?  You see, all-same.\"\r\n\r\nShe was about to dive into the sea and swim after the canoe, which was\r\nalready drifting away, but Tommy caught her and held her fast.  \"No,\r\nno, you mustn't,\" she cried anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Boat lun kick,\" cried Fangati in excitement.\r\n\r\nThe canoe, relieved of the girls' weight, would no doubt float longer\r\nthan if they had still been in it, but Tommy realized that it must soon\r\nsink.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" she cried.  \"Better lose the canoe than lose you.\"\r\n\r\nFangati stood beside her for some time, but Tommy soon became aware of\r\na double danger.  The tide was rising.  Every moment the ripples washed\r\na little farther over the rock: by and by this would be completely\r\nsubmerged and they would have to swim to the shore.  The thought of\r\nthis necessity filled Tommy with terror.  The shark had disappeared\r\nonly for a moment.  She could now see it again, circling about the\r\nrock, as if it knew that it had only to bide its time and the girls\r\nwould fall an easy prey.  As soon as there was sufficient depth of\r\nwater on the rock they would be absolutely defenceless against the\r\nmonster's hungry jaws.\r\n\r\nClinging to Fangati, Tommy called aloud for help; then, glancing\r\nshorewards, recognized that there was little chance of her voice being\r\nheard through the belt of woodland that separated her from the camp.\r\n\r\nThe sea now thinly covered the rock.  The canoe was rocking on the tide\r\nseveral yards away; the fin of the shark could still be seen as it\r\nwheeled around.  Fangati, as well aware of the danger as Tommy, could\r\nremain inactive no longer.\r\n\r\n\"Knife!\" she cried eagerly, pointing to Tommy's pocket.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"You see.  Kick! kick!\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Don't leave me,\" pleaded Tommy, handing her the knife.\r\n\r\nFangati looked around as if in search of something.  Suddenly she\r\nsnatched Tommy's handkerchief, which was tucked into her belt, and\r\ndived off the rock.  When she disappeared Tommy saw the handkerchief\r\nfloating.  In a moment the shark rushed silently through the water,\r\nattracted by the splash.  As it came beneath the handkerchief, which\r\nFangati had dropped as a decoy, she came up beneath it and plunged the\r\nknife deep into its side.  Then she dived again and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe shark, thrashing the water into foam, dashed about in zigzag\r\nfashion.  Tommy watched it fascinated, fearing that it might have\r\nstruck Fangati.  But in a moment she heard the girl's merry laugh\r\nbehind her.  Fangati came up on the farther side of the rock, on to\r\nwhich she clambered, splashing through the water to Tommy's side.  The\r\ngirls watched the gradually weakening movements of the monster, until\r\nat length with a final heave it sank to the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"S'im!  S'im!\" cried Fangati, pointing to the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I couldn't,\" said Tommy, clinging to the girl.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of there being other sharks between her and the shore\r\nunnerved her.  Yet if she remained on this rock she must be washed off\r\npresently by the fast-rising tide.  She was in a terrible state of\r\nanxiety, aware that she could not keep her footing long, yet unable to\r\nface the risk of being caught by a shark.  Fangati seemed to guess at\r\nher state of mind.  Disengaging herself from Tommy's grasp, without\r\nwaiting for objections, she slipped off the rock and swam rapidly after\r\nthe canoe, which was drifting farther and farther down the coast.\r\nTommy watched her anxiously.  Would she reach the canoe safely?  Could\r\nshe return with it in time?\r\n\r\nThe water was now up to Tommy's waist; she could hardly keep her\r\nfooting as the tide surged over the rock.  The gap between the little\r\nblack head and the canoe was steadily diminishing.  Tommy gave a gasp\r\nof relief as she saw that Fangati had overtaken the little craft.  But\r\nwhat was she doing?  She had swum beyond it.  In a moment Tommy saw the\r\nexplanation: the paddle had drifted beyond the canoe, and the swimmer\r\nhad to recover it first.  Fangati caught the paddle, turned about, and\r\nswimming back to the canoe, climbed over its side.\r\n\r\nTommy was seized with a sickening fear that help would come too late.\r\nThe waves were tumbling over the rock with increasing force: her feet\r\nwere lifted: she had the presence of mind to tread water, but was all\r\nthe time in a state of nervous terror, expecting a shark to come up and\r\nsnatch her in its horrid jaws.  She felt that Fangati in the\r\nwater-logged canoe could not reach her in time.  Again she screamed for\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SHE FELT THAT FANGATI COULD NOT REACH HER IN TIME.\"]\r\n\r\nThere came an answer from behind her.  Turning her head, scarcely able\r\nto keep afloat, she saw Elizabeth in the dinghy sculling towards her.\r\nShe swam frantically to meet her: to regain a foothold on the rock was\r\nnow impossible.  Elizabeth, glancing over her shoulder, called a cheery\r\nword, and pulled so as to meet her sister.  A few more strokes brought\r\nthem together.  Elizabeth shipped oars, but found that she could not\r\nlift Tommy into the dinghy without assistance.  Luckily Fangati was\r\nclose at hand in the canoe, now so full of water as to be on the point\r\nof sinking.  When she arrived Tommy was got into the boat, and lay down\r\nexhausted.  Elizabeth pulled her rapidly to land, while Fangati,\r\ndisdaining sharks, leapt into the sea, and swam, pushing the canoe in\r\nfront of her.\r\n\r\nTommy was very contrite when Elizabeth lifted her on to dry land.  \"I\r\nwon't do it again, Bess,\" she murmured, clinging to her sister.  \"I\r\noughtn't to have gone so far.  I was nearly drowned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, dear,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It's all right now.  I was a\r\nlittle anxious when I got back and found you still away, and I'm so\r\nglad I came to look for you.  Do you know, when I caught sight of\r\nFangati and couldn't see you I had a most horrible fear.  What\r\nhappened?  Why didn't you swim ashore?\"\r\n\r\nTommy told her the whole story.  Elizabeth forbore to reproach her.\r\nShe saw that the young girl had suffered a terrible fright, and it\r\nwould not be necessary to enforce the lesson.  She gave Fangati warm\r\npraise for what she had done, and Tommy's fondness for the native girl\r\nwas deepened by this adventure they had shared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONER IN THE CAVE\r\n\r\nSince their change of residence the girls had used a fresh look-out\r\nstation.  The precipice which they had noticed when they first caught\r\nsight of Maku's hut was very lofty, and from its summit a more\r\nextensive outlook could be obtained than any they had yet enjoyed.  Its\r\nface was unscalable; but Fangati had discovered a means of reaching its\r\ntop from the rear.  The way was steep and arduous, but the girls made\r\nlight of it.  Every day one of them climbed to the summit, and cast a\r\nsearching glance over the sea; but for weeks in succession they saw no\r\nvessel, large or small.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, however, Mary was startled on reaching the summit to see\r\nin the distance a small fleet of native canoes approaching the island.\r\nShe ran down the hillside at full speed with the news.  Maku instantly\r\nsent Fangati up to examine the vessels, and when by and by she declared\r\nthat they were canoes from her own island the old man shook with fright.\r\n\r\nThe visit was what he had long expected and dreaded.  His people were\r\ncoming with their new chief to perform the usual ceremonies in the\r\ncave.  He knew that if he were discovered he could expect no mercy; the\r\nmystery men would seize upon him, and their followers, inflamed with\r\nreligious frenzy and palm wine, would tear him to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe younger girls were beside themselves with terror.  But Elizabeth\r\nrose to the occasion.  She saw that Maku, with a kind of fatalism, was\r\ndisposed to await his destiny without stirring a hand to avert it; but\r\na possible means of escape at once occurred to her.  The canoes were\r\nstill some distance out at sea.  The usual landing-place was near the\r\ngirls' old settlement on the other side of the island.  It would\r\nprobably be dark before the savages landed, so that twelve or more\r\nhours might elapse before the danger became pressing.  In that time it\r\nwould be possible to demolish the huts, obliterate the most tell-tale\r\ntraces of habitation, and convey enough food to the pit to last them\r\nuntil the unwelcome visitors had completed their rites and taken their\r\ndeparture.  The existence of the pit was unknown to them, and though it\r\nwas impossible to cover it, there was a chance that, if the savages\r\nshould light upon it, they would imagine it to be an old breadfruit\r\npit, as Maku had done, and never suspect that it communicated with the\r\ncave.\r\n\r\nShe explained her plan rapidly to the others.  Maku was inclined to do\r\nnothing, but the girls were feverishly ready to attempt any means of\r\nescape.  Elizabeth sent Fangati to the top of the cliff to watch the\r\ncanoes, bidding her be careful to keep out of sight.  Then with her\r\nsisters she set to work to tear down their light hut and cast its\r\nmaterials into the stream.  This would carry them to the sea, and as\r\nthe current flowed away from the landing-place they would soon drift\r\nbeyond observation.  Before long the energy of the girls galvanized\r\nMaku into activity.  He demolished his hut in the same way.\r\n\r\nThey then destroyed their fire-places, covered up the blackened earth\r\nwith sand, and threw into the stream all the litter that betokened\r\noccupation.  It was impossible to remove all traces; the vegetation\r\naround the little settlement was trampled, and nothing but time could\r\nundo that.\r\n\r\n\"What about the boat and canoe?\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"We must drag them up among the trees and hope that they will not be\r\ndiscovered,\" replied Elizabeth.  \"Luckily, there are no fruit-trees in\r\nthat clump by the shore, so there's nothing to take the savages there.\"\r\n\r\nThe boats were soon hidden among the undergrowth.  Then they collected\r\ntheir little belongings, kettle, cups, fishing-line and spears, and all\r\nthe food they had at hand.  They made their mat-beds into hammocks by\r\nstringing them at the corners with creepers, and filled these with all\r\nthey wished to carry away.  By this time it was nearly dark.  Fangati,\r\nflying down the hillside, reported that the canoes had entered the\r\nlagoon by the gap in the reef and had now passed from sight.  It was\r\nclear that they were making for the usual landing-place.  Maku said\r\nthat the people would camp for the night on the shore, next day roam\r\nthe island in search of food, and in the evening hold a great feast in\r\nthe cave.\r\n\r\nHaving made all their preparations, they set off towards the pit laden\r\nwith the hammocks.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we can't take Billy,\" said Elizabeth, noticing that the parrot was\r\nperched on Tommy's shoulder.  \"His screaming would ruin us.\"\r\n\r\nTommy was distressed at the thought of leaving her old pet behind, but\r\nthere was clearly no help for it.  The bird's wings being clipped it\r\ncould not fend for itself very well, and Tommy decided to carry it down\r\nto the boat and leave it there with enough food for several days.  She\r\nkissed it on parting, fearing that she might never see it again.\r\n\r\nThey found their ladder where they had left it among the trees.  After\r\nletting down the hammocks they descended one by one, removed the\r\nladder, and retreated towards the entrance of the tunnel.  Their\r\npassage had left traces on the ground above, which must betray them if\r\nthe keen-eyed savages came that way; but there was nothing to bring\r\nthem in that direction; and the girls hoped that the pit would be a\r\nsecure hiding-place during the three days the savages might be expected\r\nto spend on the island.\r\n\r\nThe fruits they had brought with them would supply them with food and\r\ndrink for several days.  The lack of water, which might have otherwise\r\ndistressed them, was partially made up by the juice of oranges and\r\ncocoa-nuts.\r\n\r\nThey found the atmosphere of the pit close and unpleasant, but\r\nElizabeth reflected that if nothing happened to alarm them they might\r\nclimb up at dead of night and get a little fresh air while the savages\r\nwere sleeping.\r\n\r\nThe girls had little sleep during the first night.  Every few minutes\r\nthey would wake and listen, wondering if by some unlucky chance their\r\nhiding-place had been discovered.  They were still more uneasy when day\r\nbroke.  What were the savages doing?  Fangati offered to climb up and\r\nspy upon them, but Elizabeth would not permit this.  While they all\r\nremained in the pit they were safe; if the savages should catch sight\r\nof any one, they would, almost certainly, never rest until they had\r\ndiscovered the whereabouts of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe hours of daylight dragged slowly away.  The girls scarcely dared to\r\nspeak.  Several times Fangati stole along to the end of the tunnel to\r\nsee if the savages had yet entered the cave; but there was no sign of\r\nthem until the afternoon was far advanced.  Then the girl ran back to\r\nreport that there was a great noise below.  She had been much too\r\nfrightened to stay any longer; but Maku now said that he would go and\r\nlearn who the people were.\r\n\r\nHe was absent so long that the girls began to be alarmed, and were\r\nthinking of going in search of him, when they heard the light rustle of\r\nhis footsteps.  On rejoining them he groaned heavily.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Elizabeth anxiously.\r\n\r\nThe old chief groaned again.  He did not reply to Elizabeth, but spoke\r\nin a low tone rapidly to Fangati.  The girls had picked up a good many\r\nnative words, but their knowledge of the language was not sufficient\r\nfor them to understand this conversation.  From Maku's groans and\r\nFangati's exclamations of distress they gathered that the chief had\r\nmade some disagreeable discovery, and Elizabeth at length insisted on\r\nhis telling her what troubled him.\r\n\r\nThe girls were horrified when they heard what he had to say.  The cave\r\nwas full of his own people.  Among them he had seen, by the light of\r\ntheir torches of cocoa-nut husks, the new chief, a young man who was\r\nhigh in favour with the mystery men and had led the revolt against\r\nhimself.  But what had distressed him was the sight of a prisoner lying\r\nbound against the wall of the cave.  It was a white man, and Maku was\r\nalmost sure it was the \"mikinaly.\"  The mystery men could only have one\r\nobject in bringing a white missionary to the scene of their dreadful\r\norgies: he was to be offered up as a sacrifice to their heathen deities.\r\n\r\nAt this terrible news the girls' blood ran cold.  Dreadful as the\r\nhorrors of cannibalism had been to their imagination, the knowledge\r\nthat the reality would soon be enacted so near at hand was\r\noverpowering.  The thought of any human creature being tortured and\r\nkilled in cold blood was agony to them; and that the victim should be a\r\nwhite man, a fellow-countryman, within reach of them, and yet beyond\r\ntheir help, caused them to shrink and quiver as with actual physical\r\npain.\r\n\r\nFor some time they sat in silence, clasping their arms about each other.\r\n\r\nEvery now and again the old man uttered a groan.  They could not see\r\none another in the darkness, and Tommy's match-lighter was exhausted,\r\nso that they could not obtain a light; but the girls were conscious by\r\na sort of electric sympathy that Maku and even gay-hearted little\r\nFangati were scarcely less affected than themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Will it be to-night?\" asked Elizabeth presently, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" replied Maku; \"two days, flee days, den all gone.\"\r\n\r\nThis answer only increased the horror of the situation.  The victim was\r\nto linger through three days anticipating his cruel death.  The savages\r\nknew not so much mercy as to send him early to his doom.\r\n\r\n\"He no 'flaid; he all-same good man,\" murmured Maku.\r\n\r\n\"I can't stand it,\" cried Elizabeth, springing up; \"I must see for\r\nmyself.  Perhaps something can be done for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Bess!\" exclaimed Tommy, clinging to her.  \"What can you do?\r\nThey may see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they can't do that.  I must go.  Perhaps if I screamed at them\r\nthey would take me for an evil spirit and run away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what then?\" said Mary.  \"You could not go round and release the\r\npoor man; you would be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it was a foolish idea.  But something may suggest itself.  Oh, I\r\ncan't bear to think about the poor man.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you go, I go too,\" said Tommy.  \"I won't leave you.\"\r\n\r\nThe two set off, and felt their way stumblingly through the passage.\r\nPresently they were aware of a pungent aromatic smell, that increased\r\nas they went on.  This was explained when they reached the opening in\r\nthe wall; looking over stealthily, they saw, sixteen or twenty feet\r\nbelow them, on the floor of the cave, a strange bewildering sight.  A\r\nring of dusky men held aloft great flaring torches which gave out a\r\nheavy smoke that penetrated into the tunnel.  Without the circle there\r\nstood a row of drummers beating a rhythmic music on their instruments;\r\nwithin, a crowd of men were leaping in wild gyrations, uttering\r\nfrenzied yells.  In the haze nothing could be seen distinctly; all was\r\na confused whirl.  The prisoner was quite invisible.\r\n\r\nThe dance continued for a long time, the movements becoming ever more\r\nviolent and fantastic, the cries more frantic, the drumming more swift\r\nand vigorous.  At last, when the din was at its highest, the drummers\r\ngave one tremendous crash and dropped their sticks.  The whirling and\r\nthe yells ceased as by magic; the performers flung themselves fainting\r\non the ground; and there was a great silence.  But only for a few\r\nminutes.  Then the men leapt to their feet again, rushed to the side of\r\nthe cave, and returned, bringing the food laid there in readiness, and\r\nmany gourds filled with the fermented sap of palm-trees.  The\r\ntorch-bearers stuck their torches in crannies on the walls, and the\r\nwhole company gave themselves up to feasting.  The girls turned sick as\r\nthey watched the ravening gluttony of the men, and withdrew their eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go back,\" whispered Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, wait,\" said Elizabeth; \"I want to know what will happen.\"\r\n\r\nCrouching below the opening, they waited for what seemed hours.  The\r\nbarbarous noise continued, voices were raised in excitement; but\r\npresently the uproar diminished, and finally ceased.  Glancing down\r\nagain, they saw the natives lying in all sorts of attitudes.  Exhausted\r\nby the orgy, drunken with wine, they had fallen into a heavy sleep.\r\n\r\nSome of the torches had gone out.  Though the illumination was dimmer,\r\nthe smoke was so much less that objects could more easily be\r\ndistinguished.  Against the wall at the right hand the girls saw what\r\nappeared at first to be a large bundle.  But in a few moments they\r\nrecognized the form of a man--an old man with a long white beard.\r\n\r\n\"It is the missionary!\" whispered Elizabeth, clenching her hands in an\r\nagony of despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nA DESPERATE ADVENTURE\r\n\r\nHeroism is a plant of strange growth.  It springs up suddenly,\r\nmysteriously, in unexpected places.  A simple peasant girl, tending her\r\nflocks, hears a Voice; and she becomes a warrior, a leader of men, the\r\nsaviour of her country.  A maidservant, after a day of scrubbing floors\r\nand washing dishes, is darning stockings in the kitchen when she smells\r\nfire, rushes into the bedroom where the children are asleep, and\r\ncarries them one by one through the flames into safety, at the cost of\r\nher own life.\r\n\r\nSuch opportunities fall to few.  The most of us trudge a very unheroic\r\njourney through life.  The road may be dusty, with ups and downs,\r\ndangerous corners and wearisome hills; but we plod along, keeping\r\npretty closely to the highway, and taking great care at the crossings.\r\nIt is only the odd one here and there who, by what we call the accident\r\nof circumstance, or by some compelling adventurousness of spirit,\r\nstrays into the golden fields of romance, and is transformed into the\r\nshining semblance of a hero.\r\n\r\nYet the capacity for heroism may be latent under many a sober coat or\r\nhomely apron.  The town girl who shudders at a cow, the country girl\r\nwho trembles at the looming of a motor omnibus, may show under the\r\nstress of some high emotion, at the call of some great emergency,\r\nqualities that match her with Joan of Arc or Alice Ayres.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Westmacott's life had been very simple and uneventful.  She\r\nhad had nothing more difficult to cope with than the ordinary crosses\r\nand perplexities of the daily round at the farm.  She had never come\r\nface to face with mortal peril, or felt any stern demand upon her\r\ncourage and endurance.  But as she returned along the tunnel with her\r\nsister a great resolution shaped itself within her mind.  A white man\r\nwas in danger of his life; she would at least try to save him.\r\n\r\nShe was very quiet when she rejoined the little party in the pit.  It\r\nwas Tommy who, quivering with excitement, related to Mary what she had\r\nseen.  The younger girls deplored the hapless condition of the old\r\nmissionary; they wished he could be saved, but they felt the vanity of\r\nwishing.  Elizabeth sat in silence, thinking hard.\r\n\r\n\"I must go up and get a breath of air,\" she said at last.\r\n\r\n\"I'll come too,\" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"No, dear, not yet; I want to be alone.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in her tone that set her sister wondering.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be careful, Bess?\" said Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I must be careful,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nElizabeth climbed up the ladder.  She was gone some time; her return\r\nwas announced by a slight rustling thud upon the ground; something had\r\nbeen thrown into the pit.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Tommy.  \"Are you all right, Bess?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" said Elizabeth as she descended.  \"It is only a lot of\r\ncreepers.  We are going to make another ladder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another!  We don't want another.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first isn't long enough or the right sort.  I am going to release\r\nthe poor missionary.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls were for the moment speechless with amazement.  Then Tommy\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"You are mad, Bess; it is impossible.  Don't talk such absolute\r\nrubbish.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't rubbish, dear.  The savages are asleep.  We can let down a\r\nrope ladder.  I will climb down and cut his bonds.  He will be safe if\r\nwe get him into the tunnel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how insane you are!  We shan't let you do any such thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are bound to wake them, Bess,\" said Mary; \"you know how lightly\r\nsavages sleep.  They are just like dogs, and wake at a whisper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not when they have fuddled themselves.  I _must_ do it, girls.  I\r\ncan't bear to leave the poor old man to his fate without trying to help\r\nhim.  It is possible, and you must help me.\"\r\n\r\nProtest, entreaty, expostulation, were alike vain.  Even when Tommy,\r\nwith an air of triumph, exclaimed, \"The hole isn't big enough for you\r\nto squeeze through,\" Elizabeth simply replied, \"Then we must make it\r\nbigger.\"\r\n\r\nTommy knew from old experience that her elder sister was rather slow to\r\nmake up her mind about anything; but when it was made up nothing would\r\nturn her.  Some people called it firmness, I dare say there was a touch\r\nof obstinacy as well.  It was evident that Elizabeth was thoroughly\r\ndetermined now, and the younger girls at length desisted from their\r\nattempts to dissuade her, and agreed to help.\r\n\r\nLeaving Mary to assist Maku and Fangati in constructing a light ladder\r\nfrom the creepers she had gathered, Elizabeth set off with Tommy to\r\nreturn to the cave end of the tunnel.  They had their knives with them.\r\nOn arriving at the hole, they saw that the natives were still asleep,\r\nand several of the torches were almost burnt out.  The dimmer light\r\nfavoured their work of enlarging the hole, which, as Tommy had said,\r\nwas too narrow by several inches for Elizabeth to pass through, still\r\nless the rescued prisoner.\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth said that the hole must be made bigger, she had no\r\ndefinite knowledge whether it was possible.  It was characteristic of\r\nher to form a resolution and then bend everything towards its\r\naccomplishment.  If she had had a favourite motto it would have been\r\n\"Where there's a will there's a way.\"  Nevertheless, it was with some\r\nanxiety that she examined the hole.  One side of it was solid rock; it\r\nwould be a week's work to make any impression on it with their knives.\r\nBut the other side was of a more friable character.  It appeared to be\r\nformed of fragments that had settled down, and become compacted by the\r\nweight above.  A tentative chipping at this with her knife showed\r\nElizabeth that it would not be a difficult matter to scrape away enough\r\nto enlarge the hole by more than a foot.\r\n\r\nThere was danger in the task.  Work as carefully as they might, it\r\nwould be impossible to prevent some of the chips and dust from dropping\r\ninto the cave.  Luckily, none of the sleepers was immediately beneath\r\nthe hole; and Elizabeth thought that by working carefully, collecting\r\nthe larger chips and placing them on the floor of the tunnel, they\r\nmight obviate the risk of awakening the men by the noise of falling\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThey set to work very quietly, not daring even to whisper to each\r\nother.  By making boring movements with the points of their knives they\r\nbrought away a good deal of fine dust, which they took in their hands\r\nas far as possible and cast at their feet.  Whenever they found that a\r\npiece of rock of any considerable size was becoming loosened they\r\nceased work altogether with their knives and worried it out with their\r\nfingers.  At such times the fall of a certain quantity of dust into the\r\ncave could not be avoided, and more than once they stopped, holding\r\ntheir breath as they listened for some signs of disturbance below.  But\r\nall went well.  All that troubled them was the terrible slowness of the\r\nwork.  They were certainly enlarging the hole, but every inch seemed to\r\ntake an hour.  Elizabeth wondered anxiously whether they would have\r\nfinished before daylight, when it would be too late to go further with\r\nher plan.\r\n\r\nThinking of this, her attention strayed for a moment from her work; and\r\nbefore she could do anything to prevent it, a large fragment of rock\r\nbecame detached, and fell with a crash upon the floor of the cave.  The\r\ngirls started back, a cold shiver running through them.  They heard\r\nvoices, but not so loud or excited as they expected.  They dared not\r\nlook out at the hole, in case they were spied from below; but they\r\nguessed that only a few of the sleepers had been awakened, and when,\r\nafter some minutes, the sounds diminished and ceased altogether, they\r\ndrew breath again.\r\n\r\nApparently the natives had not been alarmed; such falls of rock from\r\nthe roof of the cave were probably not uncommon.  After an interval\r\nthey resumed their work with renewed courage, not, however, presuming\r\non their immunity, but taking even more care than before.  A second\r\nfall might not pass so easily.\r\n\r\nThey continued at the task for hours.  The torches in the cave went out\r\none by one.  When only one was left alight Elizabeth looked at her\r\nwatch.  It was past four o'clock.  The hole seemed to her now wide\r\nenough to admit any ordinary man: but clearly it was too late to\r\nattempt the more difficult part of her plan.  She was tired out.  It\r\nwould take some time to fetch the rope ladder from the pit, and before\r\nthe prisoner could be released and brought up into the tunnel, daylight\r\nmight be upon them.  Besides, the feasters would have slept off the\r\neffect of their orgy, and there would be a perilous risk of their\r\nawakening.  She thought it best to return to the pit and sleep.  If\r\nMaku was right, there was still more than thirty hours' respite, and\r\nshe would need all her strength and composure of mind for the final\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nThe two girls dragged themselves wearily through the tunnel.  Half-way\r\nthey heard footsteps approaching them.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that?\" cried Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad you are safe,\" replied Mary.  \"We have finished the\r\nladder, though it wasn't easy to make it in the dark, and I was getting\r\nanxious about you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to put it off until to-night,\" said Elizabeth.  \"The\r\nhole is large enough now, but it is too late to do any more.  We are\r\ndead-beat and so terribly thirsty.\"\r\n\r\nThey returned to the pit and refreshed themselves with cocoa-nut juice.\r\nBut this was a poor substitute for water, and when Fangati heard them\r\nsay how they longed for water to drink, and to bathe their hands and\r\nfaces, she volunteered to climb up and bring full cups from the stream\r\nthat ran hard by.  There was still an hour of darkness left, so\r\nElizabeth agreed, and the young girl clambered up the ladder, carrying\r\ntwo of their tin cups.  She returned very quickly, and made the journey\r\na second time: the girls, after bathing their heads with wet\r\nhandkerchiefs, lay down and slept the sleep of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nIt was high noon when they awoke, ravenously hungry.  Elizabeth carried\r\nthe new ladder out into the pit, where there was sufficient light to\r\nexamine it.  Considering that it had been made in darkness it proved a\r\nwonderfully successful piece of work, and only needed strengthening\r\nhere and there.\r\n\r\n\"How will you fix it at the hole, Bess?\" asked Tommy.  \"There is\r\nnothing to fasten it to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had thought of that.  The only way is to bind the top end of it to a\r\nlong cane or stem--too long to pass through the hole.  That will do it,\r\nI think.  I wish we had our boat-hook.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose it should break?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that the ladder won't break: those creepers are\r\nextraordinarily tough, as you know.  And half the strain will be borne\r\nby the wall, so that the pole ought not to snap.  With God's help we\r\nshall succeed, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am dreadfully afraid, Bess.\"\r\n\r\n\"The only thing I'm afraid of is the savages finding this pit.  If they\r\nshould come to it they would certainly notice the newly-trampled\r\nground, and I don't think anything could save us then.  But we must\r\nhope for the best.\"\r\n\r\nThe day passed all too slowly.  How they longed for night to come!\r\nThey could not feel easy in mind until they were sure that their\r\nhiding-place was not discovered.  Yet the younger girls dreaded the\r\nnight equally, for though the first part of Elizabeth's plan was safely\r\naccomplished, they could not think without horror of their sister\r\ndescending among the savages.  Elizabeth's quiet confidence amazed\r\nthem.  All that disturbed her was the fear that the prisoner might not\r\nbe spared until nightfall.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the day she went to the end of the tunnel and\r\nlooked over into the cave.  On one of these occasions the place was\r\nempty except for the prisoner, who lay where she had seen him before,\r\nmotionless.  Was he still alive?  Had his captors given him food and\r\ndrink?  She felt an intense compassion for the poor man.  Would there\r\nbe time, she wondered, to set him free now, before the savages\r\nreturned?  She blamed herself for not bringing the ladder with her; but\r\nreflected that she could not have known that the cave would be\r\ndeserted.  Probably by the time she had fetched the ladder and come\r\nback with Maku and some of the others to assist her, the opportunity\r\nwould have passed.\r\n\r\nBut she might speak to the prisoner and let him know that an attempt\r\nwould be made to save him.  She looked anxiously towards the mouth of\r\nthe cave.  Nobody was in sight.  No sound came from the exterior.  She\r\nmight at least venture to make a sound that would attract the attention\r\nof the prisoner and yet not arouse suspicion if it were heard by the\r\nnatives.  Leaning slightly over the ledge, she gave a low whistle.  The\r\nprisoner did not stir.  There was no sign that the sound had been\r\nheard, either by him or by another.  She whistled again rather more\r\nloudly.  Still no sign.  Taking courage she bent still lower, and\r\ncalled in a low, clear tone--\r\n\r\n\"White man!\"\r\n\r\nShe could think of no other form of address.  Maku had not told her the\r\nmissionary's name: she had not thought to ask it.\r\n\r\n\"White man!\" she repeated.\r\n\r\nThe light was dim, but it seemed to her that the prostrate form moved.\r\n\"White man, do you hear me?\" she said, panting, watching the entrance\r\nof the cave intently, stretching her ears for the slightest sound.\r\n\r\nThere came a murmur from below.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear me?\" she called again.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the answer, in a tone so faint that she could scarcely catch\r\nit.  \"Who speaks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" said Elizabeth.  \"Friends are here--English friends.\r\nTo-night you will be set free.  You will have to climb a ladder; do you\r\nunderstand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear,\" said the voice.  \"God bless you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said Elizabeth in a quick whisper: she had seen a shadow pass\r\nacross the entrance.  She withdrew her head.  A man entered, followed\r\nby others, their arms full of food for the night's feast.\r\n\r\nShe hurried back to the pit, thrilling with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"He is alive!\" she cried.  \"I have spoken to him, I told him we would\r\nsave him to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, why did you!\" said Mary tremulously.  \"Suppose you can't do it!\r\nthe poor man will be restless all day.  The savages may notice it and\r\nbe on their guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I did right,\" said Elizabeth.  \"It will be best for him to\r\nbe prepared.  If he were released without warning he might be too much\r\novercome to collect himself, and our chance would be lost.  As it is he\r\nwill know what to expect and be ready to help.  Oh, I wish it were\r\ndark!\"\r\n\r\nKnowing how much depended on her calmness and self-possession,\r\nElizabeth tried to sleep, but her nervous excitement made this\r\nimpossible.  She employed herself during the remaining hours of\r\ndaylight in testing and strengthening the ladder, and especially in\r\nensuring that the loops through which the supporting pole was to pass\r\nwere strong enough to bear the strain.  The pole could not be obtained\r\nuntil the fall of night rendered it safe to issue from the pit.  She\r\nexplained carefully to Maku and Tommy, who were to help her, how they\r\nshould hold the pole in position across the lower part of the hole, and\r\nhow, if they found that she had been discovered, they were to draw up\r\nthe ladder immediately and remain perfectly quiet.  At this Tommy's\r\nlips trembled: the idea of losing Elizabeth was dreadful.  But she\r\ndetermined not to increase the difficulty of her sister's task by any\r\nshow of agitation, and accepted her instructions without a word.\r\n\r\nAs for Maku, he had all along said nothing either for or against the\r\nscheme.  He seemed to have lost all individuality and to move like an\r\nautomaton at Elizabeth's bidding.\r\n\r\n\"What is your missionary's name?\" she asked him.\r\n\r\nHe gave a native name which he was unable to translate; the English\r\nname he had either forgotten or never heard.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first shades of evening descended, Elizabeth and Fangati\r\nclimbed out of the pit, and after a little search returned with a stout\r\nsapling, which, when a few inches had been snapped off, gave a rod not\r\nso long as the breadth of the tunnel at the farther end, but longer\r\nthan the width of the hole.  Having fastened the rope ladder firmly to\r\nthis, Elizabeth gave it to Maku to carry, and led the way along the\r\ntunnel.  She had wished Mary to remain with Fangati at the pit, but\r\nMary declared that she could not bear to be left behind wondering in\r\nthe agony of suspense, so the whole party set off, Elizabeth impressing\r\non them all the need of perfect silence.\r\n\r\nThey came to the end.  The glare, the acrid smoke, the strident voices,\r\nproclaimed that the ceremonies had already begun.  Elizabeth gave one\r\nglance into the cave, and having seen that the prisoner was still in\r\nthe same position she withdrew her eyes; the bestial conduct of the\r\nsavages sickened her.  Hour after hour passed.  The din was hideous.\r\nIt seemed that the ceremonies on this second night were being\r\nprolonged.  But presently they came to the same sudden end as before.\r\nThe drumming and the frenzied chant ceased; instead were heard the\r\nsounds of men engaged in riotous feasting.  Maku was restless; his\r\nfaded eyes lit up.  Elizabeth remembered that he must have taken part\r\nin similar orgies, and felt a nervous dread lest the excitement should\r\ncommunicate itself to him, and he should by some sudden outcry betray\r\nhis presence.  She laid her hand on his shoulder and whispered--\r\n\r\n\"Remember your friend there.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man gave a sigh, and shrank away from the hole, murmuring\r\nincomprehensibly in his own tongue.\r\n\r\nAs on the previous night, the intoxicating liquor drunk by the rioters\r\nproduced its effect in somnolence.  One by one they threw themselves\r\nback and fell into swinish slumber.  At last there was silence.\r\nSeveral of the torches had gone out and not been replaced.  Elizabeth\r\nthought her chance of success would be greatest if she waited until\r\nonly one or two remained alight.  She could not wait for absolute\r\ndarkness, for some light was necessary for her task, and she must act\r\nwhile the sleep of the natives was heaviest.\r\n\r\nNow that the critical moment had come she was strangely calm.  All\r\nnervousness and excitement had vanished; her whole being was possessed\r\nby one dominating idea--the rescue of the prisoner.  Noiselessly she\r\nlet down the flexible ladder, which lay close against the wall.  Then\r\nseeing that Tommy and Maku had grasped the ends of the small pole as\r\nshe had instructed them, she prepared to clamber through the aperture.\r\nAt the last moment Mary flung her arms round her neck and kissed her\r\npassionately; then she was gone.\r\n\r\nShe slipped down the ladder very quickly on her bare feet, carrying her\r\nopen knife.  She stood on the floor.  The men were for the most part\r\nstretched towards the middle of the cave, but one or two lay near the\r\nprisoner.  Pausing just one moment to look around, she moved quickly\r\nalong the wall, holding her skirts close about her as she passed the\r\nsleepers.  She came to the prisoner and stooped.  His eyes were open.\r\nShe dared not cut his bonds with rapid strokes, for fear the snapping\r\nshould be heard.  Gently she sawed the tendrils that were wound round\r\nabout his whole body, all her senses alert.  It seemed ages before the\r\nbonds were all loosened and removed.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner did not stir.  Elizabeth beckoned to him, but with his\r\neyes he seemed to try to explain that he was helpless.  One of the\r\nnatives moved uneasily, and for one intolerable moment Elizabeth lost\r\nher head.  Then she understood: the prisoner's bonds had been so\r\ntightly drawn, and he had so long remained in the one position, that\r\nhis limbs were numbed.  Slipping to her knees, she began to chafe his\r\nlegs.  A man at the far end of the cave gave a cough, and a hot wave\r\nsurged through the girl.  At that moment she could have wished the\r\nearth to open and swallow her.  But once again there was silence, and\r\nthe terror passed.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the prisoner was able to move his legs.  Alternately\r\nbending and straightening them, he felt them tingling with the coursing\r\nblood.  Elizabeth rose, glanced timorously round, and held out her\r\nhands to him.  He got up, staggered, and would have fallen but for her\r\nsustaining arms.  There was not enough space for both to pass abreast\r\nbetween the wall and the prostrate natives.  Walking backwards,\r\nElizabeth led him slowly towards the waiting ladder.  Every step was\r\npainful to him, and as he crept feebly on, Elizabeth's heart misgave\r\nher; would he have the strength to climb?  They came to the foot of the\r\nladder.  All the torches were now extinguished save one.  Complete\r\ndarkness would have been welcome if only Elizabeth could have had\r\nconfidence in the old man's strength.  She pointed to the ladder, then\r\nupwards towards the gap.  The missionary understood.  For an instant\r\nElizabeth hesitated.  Should she go first, leaving the prisoner to\r\nfollow, or see him in safety before she mounted herself?  A moment's\r\nconsideration showed her that she must be the first to climb.  Maku and\r\nTommy would need all their strength to keep the pole in position; the\r\nmissionary was tall and no light weight; he could not scramble through\r\nthe hole unaided; therefore she must be there to help him.  She dared\r\nnot speak to him, but in dumb show she indicated what he must do.  He\r\nnodded.  Then she gave a slight tug upon the ladder as a sign to those\r\nabove, and nimbly mounted.\r\n\r\nShe reached the top, slid through the hole, and looked back.  The old\r\nman was beginning to climb.  With fast-beating heart she watched him,\r\ndreading that now, even at the last moment, he might miss his footing\r\nand fall back among his mortal enemies.  They slept on.  Slowly,\r\ncarefully, the climber drew himself up.  To Elizabeth, fixing her eyes\r\non him, it seemed that he would never reach her.  The ladder creaked;\r\nwould the sleepers waken?  She looked anxiously towards them; they did\r\nnot move.  Inch by inch he came nearer; he had almost gained the top,\r\nwhen he swayed and for one terrible moment she thought he was lost.\r\nBut with a great effort he recovered himself; he mounted again; his\r\nhead was level with the hole.  Elizabeth thrust out her arms, gripped\r\nhis wrists, and drew him into the tunnel, holding him firmly with her\r\nstrong, supple hands.  He was through.\r\n\r\nBut his shoulders had pressed heavily upon the sides of the hole, and\r\nhis feet had not touched the floor of the tunnel when several fragments\r\nof loosened rock fell and struck the ground with a resounding clatter.\r\nThere was commotion below.  Quick as thought Elizabeth drew up the\r\nladder, leaving Mary to support the old man, whose efforts had\r\nexhausted him.\r\n\r\nAs the ladder came through the hole it caught a fragment of rock that\r\nlay on the ledge.  Elizabeth dashed forward to prevent this from\r\nfalling.  But it escaped her and fell crashing to the ground at the\r\nfeet of one of the natives, who was looking up in wonderment at the\r\nstrange thing crawling as it were into the wall.\r\n\r\nA yell proclaimed his discovery.  All hope of secrecy was at an end.\r\nInstantly the cave was filled with uproar.  The sleeping men had leapt\r\nto their feet.  At first their cries were of amazement and alarm, but\r\none blew the flickering torch into flame, others kindled fresh torches\r\nat it, and in the illumination they saw that their prisoner was gone.\r\nIn his place were the severed bonds, and beside them Elizabeth's open\r\nknife, which in her anxious help of the old missionary she had\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nWith yells of rage the natives dashed hither and thither, pointing at\r\nthe gap in the wall, in too great a frenzy of excitement to hit on a\r\nmeans of pursuing the prisoner.  One picked up a trade gun and fired,\r\nbut the uselessness of this must have been apparent to them all.\r\nSuddenly, at a word from their chief, six of them darted from the cave\r\ninto the open.  In a few minutes they returned, bringing two straight,\r\nyoung trees which they had uprooted from the loose soil outside.  These\r\nthey set against the wall, and with hideous shouts of anticipated\r\ntriumph they began to swarm up towards the hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nFRIENDS IN NEED\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at the moment of discovery the little company in the tunnel\r\nwas overcome with horror and despair.  The strain of the last few\r\nminutes had told upon Elizabeth's strength.  She trembled in every\r\nlimb.  The others were as though paralysed; and the missionary,\r\nbewildered and unstrung, stood helpless, his arms clasped by Mary in a\r\nconvulsive grip.\r\n\r\nThe glare of the rekindled torches threw a sudden light upon the end of\r\nthe tunnel.  The report of the shot seemed to shock Elizabeth into\r\nrenewed energy.  \"Back to the pit!\" she cried.  \"Mary, go first with\r\nthe missionary.\"\r\n\r\nHe had now recognized Maku, and was lost in amazement.  The whole party\r\nset off along the tunnel.  Elizabeth guessed that the ascent of the\r\nwall would offer no difficulties to men practised in climbing cocoa-nut\r\npalms, and though she was urging her friends towards the pit she had no\r\nhope of ultimate escape.\r\n\r\nThe light soon failed.  They had perforce to move slowly, and Mary\r\nwarned the missionary that presently when the roof became lower he\r\nwould have to crawl on hands and knees.  She stretched her arms above\r\nher head so that she might know when the time for stooping came.  The\r\nrest followed close behind, Elizabeth bringing up the rear.\r\n\r\nThe lowest part of the tunnel was about one-third of its length from\r\nthe gap.  As she crawled through this with Tommy immediately in front\r\nof her, Elizabeth had a sudden thought which turned despair into hope.\r\nThe roof was no more than three feet above the floor.  If only the\r\nnarrow space could be blocked, an effective obstacle to pursuit would\r\nbe set up.  Was it possible?  This portion of the tunnel was but a few\r\nyards in length.  As soon as she was able to stand again she called to\r\nthe rest to halt.\r\n\r\n\"Have you your knives?\" she asked her sisters when they came to her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" they both answered.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me, Mary,\" she said, taking Tommy's knife from her.  \"Go on\r\nwith the others; we will follow soon.\"\r\n\r\nMary and she returned to the point where the roof sloped, and\r\nElizabeth, slipping to her knees, began to prod at it with the knife.\r\nTo her great joy a shower of loose shale fell.\r\n\r\n\"Help me, Mary; work as hard as you can.\"\r\n\r\nThey plied their knives energetically.  The missionary, anxious to\r\nlearn what they were about, joined them, and, having no other\r\nimplement, lifted a piece of hard rock and prodded at the roof with\r\nthat.  Soon a considerable heap of earth and shale was piled up on the\r\nfloor.  But their tools were poor substitutes for pickaxes, and\r\nElizabeth feared that there would not be time to block the tunnel\r\neffectively before the savages arrived.\r\n\r\nAll at once there was a tremendous crash, and the girls started back in\r\nalarm, not quickly enough to escape some clods of earth that struck\r\nthem heavily.  The loosening of the under layer of the roof had\r\ndisturbed the mass above, and there had now fallen upon the floor an\r\nimmense quantity of debris which completely blocked the tunnel, and\r\ncould only be removed with long labour.\r\n\r\nElizabeth gave a cry of joy.\r\n\r\n\"We are saved for the present,\" she said.  \"Come!\"\r\n\r\nThey hurried after the others, whom they overtook just as they reached\r\nthe opening into the pit.\r\n\r\n\"We can't stay here,\" said Elizabeth; \"they'll know there must be\r\nanother entrance, and will discover it as soon as it is light.  We must\r\nget up into the woods and hide.\"\r\n\r\n\"The precipice!\" said Mary instantly.\r\n\r\n\"We could hardly get there in the dark,\" replied Elizabeth; \"it's too\r\ndangerous.  But we must go as near it as possible, and climb to the top\r\nwhen we can see our way.\"\r\n\r\nThey wasted no time, but set up the ladder at once and clambered out of\r\nthe pit.  Their haste was such that none thought of taking with them\r\nany of their belongings until Elizabeth, at the last moment, remembered\r\nthat there were no fruit-trees where they were going.  She collected\r\nall the food that remained and handed it up to her sisters, together\r\nwith their kettle and tin cups.\r\n\r\nTo Fangati was given the task of leading the party through the woods.\r\nTheir destination was a little hollow some distance away on the reverse\r\nside of the precipice.  It was thickly covered with trees, and would\r\nafford shelter for the rest of the night.  As soon as they dared they\r\nwould climb to the summit, a feat which in the darkness would be\r\nhazardous in the extreme.\r\n\r\nFangati was an unerring guide, and a quarter of an hour's uphill walk\r\nbrought them to the wooded hollow.  Elizabeth and Mary each took an arm\r\nof the missionary to assist him; indeed, Elizabeth felt the need of\r\nsupport herself; her strength was nearly exhausted.  Not a word was\r\nspoken during the journey.  All ears were strained to catch sounds from\r\nbelow.  For a time they heard nothing, but presently the cries of the\r\nislanders came faintly on the air from afar.  These ceased before they\r\nreached their shelter, and it seemed that the pursuit was taking\r\nanother direction.\r\n\r\nThey sank upon the ground beneath the trees.\r\n\r\n\"Let us thank God for all His mercies,\" said the missionary, and in\r\ntones little above a whisper, he uttered a few simple words of\r\ngratitude and of entreaty for protection during the night.\r\n\r\n\"I am filled with amazement at my marvellous deliverance,\" he said to\r\nElizabeth.  \"I know Maku and Fangati, but who are you, my dear young\r\nladies, and how came you upon this island?  Have you nobody else with\r\nyou?  But I am inconsiderate; you must be very weary: doubtless you\r\nwill tell me all in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am tired,\" Elizabeth confessed; \"but I could not sleep, and the joy\r\nof hearing an English voice is greater than I can tell.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a sob in her voice.  Mary clasped her hand.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell our story, Bess dear,\" she said; \"lay your head in my lap\r\nand rest.\"\r\n\r\nSo Mary quietly began to relate the story of their voyage.  As she\r\ncasually mentioned the name of the vessel the missionary interrupted\r\nwith an exclamation.\r\n\r\n\"The _Elizabeth_!  Was her skipper Captain Barton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mary in surprise.  \"Did you know Uncle Ben?\"\r\n\r\n\"Know him!  He was one of my oldest friends.  I met him in London a few\r\ndays before he sailed; indeed, he offered to bring me back in his own\r\nvessel.  He mentioned that his nieces were accompanying him.  What has\r\nhappened?\"\r\n\r\nMary went on to tell of the wreck, the landing on the island, and the\r\nsimple outline of their life since.\r\n\r\n\"Marvellous,\" said the old man; \"and my poor old friend!--you saw\r\nnothing of the raft?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.  Do you think that there is any chance at all that Uncle Ben\r\nwas saved?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell.  Strange things happen in the providence of God.  I see\r\nthe hand of God in your presence here; but for that I should not have\r\nlived another day.  We can but trust that my old friend is safe.  He\r\nmay be on one of these many islands.  I hope so.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to a question from Mary he related how he had gone from\r\nLondon to San Francisco, and sailed thence in an American ship for the\r\nSouth Pacific.  Having made a tour of the mission-stations, he had only\r\nreached his own island a few days ago.  He had been met on the shore by\r\nthe natives with every mark of welcome; the absence of the chief was\r\nplausibly explained; but the vessel had no sooner departed than he was\r\nseized and tied up.  He expected instant death, but had been reserved\r\nfor sacrifice at the ceremonies in connection with the inauguration of\r\nthe new chief.\r\n\r\n\"Did they give you food?\" asked Tommy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear, or I should never have had the strength to profit by\r\nyour sister's brave deed.  Do you know, when I heard her voice, I\r\nthought it had been the voice of an angel, speaking to me as the angel\r\nspoke to St. Peter in prison.  The remembrance of how the apostle was\r\nset free was very cheering as I lay waiting for night.  Your sister has\r\nindeed been an angel of deliverance.  I thank God, who put courage into\r\nher heart.\"\r\n\r\nThey talked until the light of dawn stole through the trees.  Elizabeth\r\nhad fallen asleep.  Without disturbing her the others rose and went to\r\nthe edge of the clump of woodland, whence a considerable portion of the\r\nisland was visible.  No savages were in sight or hearing.  They made a\r\nbreakfast of fruit, and when Elizabeth awoke, and had eaten, they took\r\ntheir way with many precautions up the steep ascent to the summit of\r\nthe precipice.\r\n\r\nThere grew upon it a few palm-trees, which did not afford as good a\r\nscreen as the clump they had just left.  On the other hand it commanded\r\na wider outlook over the sea.  They hoped that the savages, failing to\r\ndiscover them, would eventually return to their island.  Only when they\r\nsaw the canoes departing would it be safe to venture down again.\r\n\r\nTheir situation gave them much anxiety.  Their stock of food was small,\r\nand they had now another mouth to feed.  Already they felt the lack of\r\nwater.  The stream that flowed near the pit and plunged down over the\r\nwaterfall was too far distant for them to attempt to visit it; and\r\nwhile the savages were on the island the still longer journey to the\r\nstream near the site of their original hut was out of the question.\r\nThey hoped with all their heart that the intruders would soon depart.\r\n\r\nBut this hope died as the day wore on.  From time to time they heard\r\nshouts, now distant, now nearer at hand.  Clearly the men were\r\nsearching for them.  Once they were greatly alarmed when they caught\r\nsight of dusky figures crossing the open ground below their recent\r\nsettlement, and knew by their shouts and gestures that they had\r\ndiscovered traces of habitation.  The natives had indeed already come\r\nupon the pit and searched it.  By good fortune they had followed the\r\ntracks down to the shore instead of up into the higher ground.  They\r\nscoured the copse in which the boat and canoe had been placed, and on\r\ndiscovering them hastened along the shore in both directions.  No doubt\r\nit was only the apparent inaccessibility of the precipice that\r\nprevented them from suspecting that as the fugitives' place of refuge.\r\n\r\nThe day passed.  The little party lay in the shade of the trees, and\r\nkept as still as possible; but they were much distressed by heat and\r\nthirst, and at the fall of night the girls felt thoroughly worn out.\r\nMr. Corke, the missionary, arranged that they should sleep through the\r\nnight, while he and the two natives kept watch.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was very unwilling that this task should be undergone by the\r\nold man; but he assured her that he was very tough, and had quite\r\nrecovered from the effects of confinement, owing to the fortunate\r\ncircumstance that the islanders had not deprived him of food.\r\n\r\nWhen the next morning broke, and the girls, feeling weak and ill, rose\r\nfrom their hard couches, they were amazed to discover that Mr. Corke\r\nwas no longer with them.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" asked Elizabeth anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"He go fetch water,\" said Maku.  \"He say mus' have water, so he go down\r\nall-same fetch some.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you let him?  Why didn't you wake us?\" cried Elizabeth in\r\ngreat distress.\r\n\r\n\"He say mus' go,\" persisted the old chief.  \"He say you do lot fo' he,\r\nhe do little t'ing fo' you.\"\r\n\r\nTommy ran to the edge of the plantation to look for the missionary.\r\nHer sisters heard her give a low cry, and next moment she came running\r\nback to them, her eyes ablaze with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"A ship!  A ship!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nThe startling news was almost overwhelming.  For a moment the girls\r\nstood as though rooted to the ground, then they rushed forward,\r\nfollowing Tommy, who had already darted back towards the edge.  Their\r\nhearts leapt within them as they saw, far out at sea, a line of black\r\nsmoke, and beneath it the low hull of a steamer.\r\n\r\n\"Is she coming this way?\" said Mary anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do hope so,\" said Elizabeth.  \"We must make a signal.  Let us\r\ntie our handkerchiefs together; Fangati can climb one of the trees with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Fangati had climbed a tall stem, and tied the three\r\nknotted handkerchiefs to a branch projecting towards the sea.  Then the\r\ngirls remembered Mr. Corke, whom in their momentary excitement they had\r\nforgotten.  There was no sound from below; the natives had certainly\r\nnot yet seen him, or shouts would have announced their delight.\r\n\r\nBut his continued absence made the girls ache with dread.\r\n\r\nThey watched the steamer eagerly; the hull was enlarging; it was\r\napproaching rapidly; it was heading straight for the island.  The\r\nsignal had apparently been seen.  But there was still no sign of the\r\nmissionary.\r\n\r\nWhen the vessel was about half-a-mile from the shore its motion ceased.\r\n\r\n\"They are afraid to come closer because of the rocks,\" said Mary.\r\n\"Look, they're lowering a boat.\"\r\n\r\nBut at this moment their attention was withdrawn from the steamer by\r\nstartling sounds from below--loud, fierce shouts mingled with the\r\nreport of fire-arms.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!  I'm afraid they've caught him,\" exclaimed Elizabeth, clasping her\r\nhands in distress.\r\n\r\nThey ran along the edge of the precipice to a spot where they had a\r\nbetter view of the open ground from the cove to the site of their huts.\r\nThe din was increasing in volume and fury, but as yet nothing could be\r\nseen.  Suddenly, from beyond the jutting edge of a crag, they saw the\r\nmissionary running with all his might, not towards them, but towards\r\nthe sea.  The girls wondered at this, for he could not have caught\r\nsight of the steamer, owing to the trees.  It dawned on them afterwards\r\nthat the chivalrous old man, in his care for them, was leading the\r\npursuers away from their hiding-place.\r\n\r\nQuivering with apprehension they watched the runner.  Presently, less\r\nthan a hundred yards behind him, a horde of savages burst into view,\r\nuttering frantic yells, as they leapt after their expected victim.  For\r\nsome moments he disappeared from the view of the anxious spectators on\r\nthe precipice, hidden by the intervening trees.  Then he emerged again;\r\nhe was still running at a speed amazing in a man of his years.  What\r\nwould be the end of the race?  The pursuers were gaining on him; they\r\nwere hard at his heels: it seemed impossible that he should not be\r\novertaken.\r\n\r\nHe was now upon the beach.  A few yards of sand separated him from the\r\nsea.  He stumbled, recovered himself, dashed on again, and to the\r\ngirls' horror plunged into the water.  The terrifying image of hungry\r\nsharks rose in their minds.  Several of the pursuers halted and\r\nlevelled their guns at the swimmer, others plunged in after him,\r\nevidently determined not to be baulked of their prey.\r\n\r\nAll this time the attention of the girls had been divided between this\r\nscene on the shore and the steamer's boat, which was rapidly\r\napproaching.  They could not tell whether it had been seen either by\r\nthe pursuers or the fugitive.  They watched in breathless excitement.\r\nThe boat was drawing nearer to the swimmer, but the foremost of the\r\nsavages was nearer still.  Suddenly there was a flash and a puff of\r\nsmoke from the boat, followed by a report.  The brown men stopped:\r\nthere was a moment's hesitation, then they were seen striking out\r\nvigorously for the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Saved!  Saved!\" cried Tommy, dancing for joy.  \"Oh, let's go and meet\r\nthem, Bess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better wait, dear,\" said Elizabeth, whose lips were quivering.  \"Let\r\nthem drive the savages away first.\"\r\n\r\nIn tense excitement they watched the missionary lifted into the boat.\r\nIt was too far distant as yet for them to distinguish its occupants.\r\nAs soon as the missionary was aboard the sailors dipped their oars\r\nagain and pulled lustily for the shore.  The girls strained their eyes.\r\nThe newcomers might be Dutch, French, English, or American; they were\r\nwhite men; the long captivity was ended.\r\n\r\nThe boat had almost reached the beach.  Suddenly Tommy gave a scream,\r\nand clutched at Mary's arm.\r\n\r\n\"It's Uncle Ben!  It's Uncle Ben!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE HOME-COMING\r\n\r\nWho can describe the happiness of friends long parted when they meet\r\nagain!  As there is a grief too deep for tears, so there is a joy too\r\nintense for words to express.  Let the reader picture to herself the\r\nmeeting of uncle and nieces, the sober satisfaction of Mr. Purvis, the\r\necstasy of little Dan Whiddon, the jolly faces of Long Jimmy, Sunny Pat\r\nand the rest.\r\n\r\nUncle Ben's story was a simple and natural one.  He had no sooner\r\nlaunched the raft with all his crew on board, than the _Elizabeth_ went\r\ndown with a gurgle and was seen no more.  The raft drifted about for\r\ndays at the mercy of every current, until it was sighted by a merchant\r\nbrig.  The castaways were picked up, but in spite of Captain Barton's\r\nentreaties the skipper would not alter his course to search for the\r\ngirls.  He was bound for San Francisco with a perishable cargo, and\r\ndeclared that he could not waste time and money scouring the South\r\nPacific for any females, even were they princesses or queens.\r\n\r\nAt San Francisco Captain Barton chartered a steamer.  He never spoke of\r\nthe pang this must have cost him.  Those who knew the old man guessed\r\nhow bitterly he felt the necessity, at the close of his career, of thus\r\ntacitly admitting the superiority of steam over sails.\r\n\r\nThe steamer had made for Maku's island, Captain Barton hoping to enlist\r\nthe services of Mr. Corke and the people in the search for his nieces.\r\nLearning on his arrival that Maku had disappeared, and that the\r\nmissionary had been carried away to the sacred island, he at once\r\nstarted to rescue his friend.  He was distressed at the interruption of\r\nhis primary quest, but when Mr. Corke's whereabouts was a certainty,\r\nwhile his nieces' very existence was doubtful, he felt that the nearer\r\nduty must be accomplished first.  His delight at being able to rescue\r\nthe girls, his friend, and the old chief at the same time may be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nHis action on the island was summary.  On learning the state of\r\naffairs, he sent the steamer along the shore to the spot where the\r\nnative canoes were beached, drove off the infuriated natives with a\r\nwarning shot from his brass gun, and had the canoes towed out to sea.\r\nHe said he did not hold with revolutions, and meant to reinstate Maku\r\nin his old chiefdom.  Since those of his disaffected subjects who had\r\ncome to the island were the mystery men and their principal supporters,\r\nhe decided to leave them there with their new chief, having learnt that\r\nthey would have no difficulty in finding sustenance.  He would carry\r\nback Maku and Fangati with the missionary to their island, and to\r\nensure that they should not be molested by the revolutionaries he\r\ndetermined to take the canoes in tow, and so leave them without the\r\nmeans of crossing the sea.\r\n\r\nThe girls left the scene of their adventures without regret.  Looking\r\nback upon their life there, they acknowledged that it had been on the\r\nwhole happy, and their terrors seemed trifling now that they were free\r\nfrom them.  Tommy did not fail to seek for her parrot, which she found\r\ndisconsolate in the boat, and which, she declared, spoke to her for the\r\nfirst and last time in its life when she took it up and perched it on\r\nher shoulder.  She was very reluctant to part with Fangati, and tried\r\nto persuade her uncle to take her back to England with them; but the\r\nold man assured her that the girl was happier in her own land, and put\r\nan end to the subsequent discussion with one of his crusted aphorisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a little town in Surrey which, though not far from London,\r\npreserves a good deal of the charm of the country.  Its roads are\r\nshaded with unlopped trees; its houses lie amid pleasant gardens; and\r\nbeing away from the main routes it is not devastated by motor cars.\r\n\r\nIn the front garden of one of the houses rises a tall white mast,\r\ncomplete with yards and halyards.  Over the entrance stands the model\r\nof a full-rigged barque.  In the hall a white parrot spends a placid\r\nbut noisy existence.  These emblems of the nautical life are confined\r\nto the front of the house; at the back there is a tennis lawn, a\r\nwell-kept flower garden, with glass-houses, and an orchard.\r\n\r\nCaptain Barton was advised to take this house by his lawyer, who wished\r\nto let it for a client.  A tramp through Deptford and Rotherhithe soon\r\nconvinced him that, however well suited those riverside suburbs may\r\nhave been to seafaring men in the days of Queen Bess, they did not\r\noffer much attraction nowadays to a retired mariner with three nieces.\r\nAnd having assured himself that the country town in question had an\r\nexcellent high school for girls, with a practising school attached, he\r\nfollowed his lawyer's advice--for once in a way, as he said.\r\n\r\nElizabeth keeps house for him, spending a good deal of time in the\r\ngarden.  She is assisted there by Dan Whiddon, who does not grow very\r\nfast, although the Captain makes him climb the mast once a day for the\r\nsake of stretching his limbs.  Mary is learning how to teach, and Tommy\r\nis in the fifth form at school, champion in tennis, and a dashing\r\nforward in the hockey team.  Her first reports made her uncle screw up\r\nhis mouth, and rub his bald pate, and ask Elizabeth what on earth was\r\nto be done with a minx like that.  \"Has good abilities, but lacks\r\napplication,\" he quoted.  \"Much too talkative.  Has lost too many\r\nconduct marks this term.\"  Elizabeth begged him to be patient, assuring\r\nhim that Tommy would turn out quite well in time.  And as the same\r\nmistresses who penned the above remarks are all wonderfully fond of\r\nTommy, and she is the most popular girl in the school, it is evident\r\nthat she has at least one most enviable quality, the power of winning\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nA visitor often comes to the house, at whose appearance Captain Barton\r\nretires to his den and grumps and growls over his beloved pipe.  The\r\nyoung electrical engineer whom the girls had met in Valparaiso will\r\ncertainly get on in the world, if dogged persistence has its reward.\r\nThough they had then been unable to give him any address, and had held\r\nno communication with him since, they had not been settled more than a\r\nweek before he called.  \"The impudence of the fellow!\" said Captain\r\nBarton inwardly, when Elizabeth introduced the visitor.  Through the\r\nwreaths of smoke from his pipe the worthy Captain sees visions of\r\nElizabeth keeping house for some one else, and the poor man, I fear it\r\nmust be confessed, is jealous.  Tommy looks on with a humorous twinkle\r\nin her eye.\r\n\r\n\"Poor old Nunky!\" she thinks.  \"He's wondering what in the world he'll\r\ndo when Bess is married, and Mary's away teaching, and he's left to the\r\ntender mercies of _Me_!\"\r\n\r\nBut I have watched many girls in my time, and I shouldn't be at all\r\nsurprised if Tommy--she will have her hair up and be Miss Katherine\r\nWestmacott then--develops into a very capable housekeeper.  She will\r\ncertainly be what an old lady friend of mine calls \"a bit of sunshine\r\nin the home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Richard Clay & Sons, Ltd., London and Bungay._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS FOR GIRLS\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY\r\n\r\nHENRY FROWDE AND HODDER & STOUGHTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED BOOK FOR GIRLS\r\n\r\nEDITED BY\r\n\r\nMrs. HERBERT STRANG\r\n\r\nA miscellany for girls, containing a large number of complete original\r\nstories by popular writers; extracts from great authors; articles and\r\npoems.

Here, under the guardianship of Uncle\r\nHilary, they enter into the spirit of their new situation; and when it\r\ncomes to a question of ways and means, prove that they have both\r\ncourage and resource.  Thus Bertha secretly takes a position as\r\nstock-keeper to a fashionable dressmaker; Milly tries to write, and has\r\nthe satisfaction of seeing her name in print; Edward takes up\r\narchitecture and becomes engrossed in the study of \"cupboards and\r\nkitchen sinks\"; while all the rest contribute as well to the\r\nmaintenance of the household as to the interest of the story.\r\n\r\n\"We have seldom read a prettier story than ...

TENISON.\r\nLarge crown 8vo, cloth, olivine edges.  5/-.\r\n\r\nThis is a story of Colonial life by an author who is new to English\r\nreaders.  In writing about Australia Miss Whitfeld is, in a very\r\nliteral sense, at home; and no one can read her book without coming to\r\nthe conclusion that she is equally so in drawing pen portraits of\r\nchildren.  Her work possesses all the vigour and freshness that one\r\nusually associates with the Colonies, and at the same time preserves\r\nthe best traditions of Louisa Alcott.  In \"Tom who was Rachel\" the\r\nauthor has described a large family of children living on an up-country\r\nstation; and the story presents a faithful picture of the everyday life\r\nof the bush.  Rachel (otherwise Miss Thompson, abbreviated to \"Miss\r\nTom,\" afterwards to \"Tom,\") is the children's step-sister; and it is\r\nher influence for good over the wilder elements in their nature that\r\nprovides the real motive of a story for which all English boys and\r\ngirls will feel grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELSIE J.

Nanciebel's father, Sir John\r\nSeymour, had so incurred the displeasure of King Charles by his\r\npersistent opposition to the threatened war against the Dutch, that he\r\nwas sent out of the country.  Nothing would dissuade Nanciebel from\r\naccompanying him, so they sailed away together and were duly landed on\r\na desolate shore, which they afterwards discovered to be a part of\r\nWales.  Here, by perseverance and much hard toil, John o' Peace made a\r\nnew home for his family, in which enterprise he owed not a little to\r\nthe presence and constant help of Nanciebel, who is the embodiment of\r\nyouthful optimism and womanly tenderness.\r\n\r\n\"A charming book for girls.\"--_Evening Standard_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINIFRED M.

When she is first introduced to\r\nus she is staying on a holiday at Quantuck, a secluded seaside retreat;\r\nand Miss Ray describes the various members of this small summer\r\ncommunity with considerable humour.  Among others is Mrs. Van Hicks, a\r\nlady of great possessions, but little culture, who seeks to put people\r\nunder a lasting obligation to her by making friends with them.  On\r\nhearing that a nephew of this estimable lady is about to arrive at\r\nQuantuck, Betty makes up her mind beforehand to dislike him.  At first\r\nshe almost succeeds, for, like herself, Percival has a temper, and can\r\nbe \"thorny\" at times.  As they come lo know each other better, however,\r\na less tempestuous state of things ensues, and eventually they cement a\r\nfriendship that is destined to carry them far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNathalie's Sister\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by N.

She is, indeed, merely Nathalie's Sister, without a name\r\nof her own, shining with a borrowed light.  Before the end is reached,\r\nhowever, her many good qualities have received the recognition they\r\ndeserve, and she is Margaret Arterburn, enjoying the respect and\r\nadmiration of all her friends.  Her temper is none of the best: she has\r\na way of going direct to the point in conversation, and her words have\r\nsometimes an unpleasant sting; yet when the time comes, she reveals\r\nthat she is not lacking in the qualities of gentleness and affection,\r\nnot to say heroism, which many young readers have already learned to\r\nassociate with her sister Nathalie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNathalie's Chum\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by DUDLEY TENNANT.

After the death of their parents the children were scattered\r\namong different relatives, and the story describes the efforts of the\r\neldest son, Harry, to bring them together again.  At first there is a\r\ngood deal of aloofness, owing to the fact that, having been kept apart\r\nfor so long, the children are practically strangers to each other; but\r\nat length Harry takes his sister Nathalie into his confidence and makes\r\nher his ally in the management of their small household, while she\r\nfinds in him the chum of whom she has long felt the need.\r\n\r\n\"Another of those pleasant stories of American life which Miss Anna\r\nChapin Ray knows so well how to write.\"--_Birmingham Post_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeddy: Her Book\r\n\r\nA Story of Sweet Sixteen.\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour, by ROBERT HOPE.

The rest of her time is passed at a small boarding school,\r\nwhere, as might be supposed, Elma's friends look upon her rather as an\r\nordinary healthy girl than as one possessing unusual wisdom.  The story\r\ntells of Elma's humble life at school, her occasional excursions into\r\nfashionable society; the difficulties she experiences in her endeavour\r\nto reconcile the two; and the way in which she eventually wins the\r\nhearts of those around her in both walks of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL.

Amongst these were\r\nthe Battle of the Nile, and the discovery of Napoleon's plans of\r\ncampaign, in each of which incidents the hero, Mr. Thomas Nunn,\r\nMidshipman, was concerned.  He was captured and taken to Paris, and it\r\nwas here that the plans of campaign fell into his hands; what he did\r\nwith them forms the material of an exciting story.\r\n\r\n_Daily News_.--\"It is a magnificent story, with not an error of phrase\r\nor thought in it....

Crown 8vo, cloth\r\nelegant, olivine edges, 6s.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the great Boxer Rebellion in China, Gerald Wood, the\r\nhero of this story, was living with his mother and brother at Milton\r\nTowers, just outside Tientsin.  When the storm broke and Tientsin was\r\ncut off from the rest of the world, the occupants of Milton Towers made\r\na gallant defence, but were compelled by force of numbers to retire\r\ninto the town.  Then Gerald determined to go in quest of the relief\r\ncolumn under Admiral Seymour.  He carried his life in his hands, and on\r\nmore than one occasion came within an ace of losing it; but he managed\r\nto reach his goal in safety, and was warmly commended by the Admiral on\r\nhis achievement.  The author has found opportunity in this record of\r\nstirring events for some excellent characterisation, and, among others,\r\nthe matter-of-fact James, Mr. Wang, and Mr. Midshipman Tite will be\r\nfound diverting in the extreme.\r\n\r\n_Outlook_.--\"An excellent piece of craftsmanship.\"\r\n\r\n_Ladies' Field_.--\"All the sketches of Chinese character are excellent,\r\nand we read the book with delight from the first page to the last.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM J.

Edmond le Blanc, the son of a Huguenot gentleman, undertakes\r\nto convey a secret letter of warning to Coligny, and the adventures he\r\nmeets with on the way lead to his accepting service in the Huguenot\r\narmy.  He shares in the hard fighting that took place in the\r\nneighbourhood of La Rochelle, does excellent work in scouting for the\r\nAdmiral, and is everywhere that danger calls.

M. BROCK.  Crown 8vo, cloth elegant,\r\nolivine edges, 5s.\r\n\r\nThe incidents of this story arise out of the uniting of two\r\nschools--\"Warner's\" and \"Corunna\"--under the name of \"Winton,\" a name\r\nwhich the head master fondly hopes will become known far and wide as a\r\ngreat seat of learning.  Unfortunately for the head master's ambition,\r\nhowever, the two sets of boys--hitherto rivals and enemies, now\r\nschoolfellows--do not take kindly to one another.  Warner's men of\r\nmight are discredited in the new school; Henderson, lately head boy,\r\nfinds himself a mere nobody; while the inoffensive Dove is exalted and\r\nmade prefect.  The feud drags on until the rival factions have an\r\nopportunity of uniting against a common enemy.  Then, in the enthusiasm\r\naroused by the overthrow of a neighbouring agricultural college, the\r\nbitterness between themselves dies away, and the future of Winton is\r\nassured.\r\n\r\n_Sheffield Daily Telegraph_.--\"Its literary style is above the average\r\nand the various characters are thoroughly well drawn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bending of a Twig\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by H.

Crown 8vo, cloth elegant,\r\nolivine edges, 5s.\r\n\r\nWhen \"The Bending of a Twig\" was first published it was hailed by\r\ncompetent critics as the finest school story that had appeared since\r\n\"Tom Brown.\" Then, however, it was purely a story about boys; now Mr.\r\nCoke has enlarged and partly rewritten it, and made it more attractive\r\nto schoolboy readers.  It is a vivid picture of life in a modern public\r\nschool.  The hero, Lycidas Marsh, enters Shrewsbury without having\r\npreviously been to a preparatory school, drawing his ideas of school\r\nlife from his fertile imagination and a number of school stories he has\r\nread.

In particular does the spirited exploit with which it\r\nopens--the whitewashing by night of a town statue and the smashing of\r\ncertain school property--raise itself against him, next term, when he\r\nhas been set in authority.  His two former friends persist in still\r\nregarding him as an ally, bound to them by their common secret; and, in\r\na sense, he is attracted to their enterprises, for in becoming prefect\r\nhe does not cease to be a boy.

Claudia is a person of instincts,\r\nand it does not take her long to discover that there is something\r\nmysterious about Miss Strongitharm.  A clue upon which the children\r\nstumble leads to the notion that Miss Strongitharm is a Nihilist in\r\nhiding.

All\r\novertures of peace fail, however, for Patty feels that the other girls\r\nhave no real liking for her and she refuses to be patronised.  Thus,\r\nchiefly owing to misunderstanding and careless gossip, the feud is\r\ncontinued to the end of the term; and the climax of the story is\r\nreached when, in a cave in the face of a cliff, in imminent danger of\r\nbeing drowned, Patty and Kathleen for the first time understand each\r\nother, and lay the foundations of a lifelong friendship.\r\n\r\n_Schoolmaster_.--\"A thoroughly faithful and stimulating story of\r\nschoolgirl life.\"\r\n\r\n_Glasgow Herald_.--\"The story is well told.

She is, indeed, merely Nathalie's Sister, without a name\r\nof her own, shining with a borrowed light.  Before the end is reached,\r\nhowever, her many good qualities have received the recognition they\r\ndeserve, and she is Margaret Arterburn, enjoying the respect and\r\nadmiration of all her friends.  Her temper is none of the best: she has\r\na way of going direct to the point in conversation, and her words have\r\nsometimes an unpleasant sting; yet when the time comes, she reveals\r\nthat she is not lacking in the qualities of gentleness and affection,\r\nnot to say heroism, which many young readers have already learned to\r\nassociate with her sister Nathalie.\r\n\r\n_Record_.--\"'Nathalie's Sister' is written in Miss Ray's best style and\r\nhas all those bright breezy touches which characterise her work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNathalie's Chum.\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by DUDLEY TENNANT.

The present story, which is cast in the\r\nsame mould, deals with a chapter in the career of the Arterburn family,\r\nand particularly of Nathalie, a vivacious, strong-willed girl of\r\nfifteen.  After the death of their parents the children were scattered\r\namong different relatives, and the story describes the efforts of the\r\neldest son, Harry, to bring them together again.  At first there is a\r\ngood deal of aloofness owing to the fact that, having been kept apart\r\nfor so long, the children are practically strangers to each other; but\r\nat length Harry takes his sister Nathalie into his confidence and makes\r\nher his ally in the management of their small household, while she\r\nfinds in him the chum of whom she has long felt the need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeddy: Her Book\r\n\r\nA Story of Sweet Sixteen.\r\n\r\nIllustrated in Colour by ROBERT HOPE.

Crown 8vo,\r\ncloth elegant, gilt edges, 6s.\r\n\r\nThis delightful little story introduces to us a family dwelling upon\r\nthe outskirts of a vast and mysterious pine forest in France.  These\r\nare Master Lepage, who, as head of the household and a veteran of the\r\nwars, lays down the law upon all sorts of questions, domestic and\r\npolitical; his meek, sweet-faced wife Susan; their two sons Anthony and\r\nPaul; and Cincinnatus the cat--who holds as many opinions and expresses\r\nthem as freely as Master Lepage himself; and--little Peter.  Little\r\nPeter makes friends with John Paqualin, a queer, tall, crook-backed old\r\ncharcoal-burner, whom the boys of the village call \"the grasshopper\r\nman,\" and whom every one else treats with contempt; but this is not\r\nsurprising, since Little Peter makes friends with every one he meets,\r\nand all who read about him will certainly make friends with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy CHRISTINA GOWANS WHYTE\r\n\r\nThe Adventures of Merrywink\r\n\r\nIllustrated by M. V. WHEELHOUSE.\r\n\r\nCrown 4to, cloth elegant, 6s.\r\n\r\nThis story won the £100 prize for the best children's story in the\r\nBookman competition.  It tells of a pretty little child who was born\r\ninto Fairyland with a gleaming star in his forehead.  When his parents\r\nbeheld this star they were filled with gladness and fear, and in the\r\nnight they carried their little Fairy baby, Merrywink, far away and hid\r\nhim.  Why was it necessary to carry Merrywink away so secretly?\r\nBecause of two old prophecies: the first, that a daughter should be\r\nborn to the King and Queen of Fairyland; the second that the King\r\nshould rule over Fairyland until a child appeared with a gleaming star\r\nin his forehead.  Now, on the very day that Merrywink was born, the\r\nlong-promised little Princess arrived at the Royal Palace; and the\r\nKing, who was determined to keep his throne to himself, sent round\r\nmessages to make sure that the child with the gleaming star had not yet\r\nbeen seen in Fairyland.  The story tells us how Merrywink grew up to be\r\nbrave and strong, and fearless and truthful; how he set out on his\r\ntravels and met the Princess at court; and all that happened afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy E.
