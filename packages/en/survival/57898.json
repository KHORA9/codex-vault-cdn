But such, however\r\nrespectable in themselves, or however advantageous for children, are\r\nwholly insufficient for persons who are in search of extended knowledge,\r\nand desirous of furnishing their minds with useful information.\r\n\r\nOn these subjects there has not hitherto been published any work in\r\nwhich they are collectively to be found; nor could a knowledge of them\r\nbe obtained but by the consultation of many and expensive writings. That\r\nthey are generally important to be known will not probably be denied.\r\n\r\nIt has consequently been the object of the author to compress all the\r\ninteresting information that could be obtained respecting them, within\r\nas narrow a compass, and at the same time to render this information as\r\nentertaining, and as devoid of technical words and phrases, as possible.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of the work will, it is hoped, be found sufficiently simple.\r\nThe passage in smaller characters at the head of each article, is in\r\ngeneral so arranged as to reply to the questions, “What is?” “What are?”\r\nor “How do you know?” For instance: “What is flint?” (See Vol. I. p.\r\n53.) The answer will be found thus: “Flint is a peculiarly hard and\r\ncompact kind of stone, generally of smoke─grey colour, passing into\r\ngreyish white, reddish, or brown. It is nearly thrice as heavy as water,\r\nand, when broken, will split in every direction, into pieces which have\r\na smooth surface.” The author is aware that, in many instances, the\r\ndefinitions are defective: but this has, in general, arisen from a\r\nnecessity of rendering them short, and at the same time of using such\r\nterms as would be likely to convey information to the minds of persons\r\nwho have had no previous knowledge of the systems of natural history.\r\n\r\nAfter the definition, a further illustration sometimes follows; and in\r\nthe large characters will be found a brief detail of the history and\r\nuses of the object described. The articles are numbered, for the greater\r\nconvenience both of reference and explanation, but particularly the\r\nlatter. Thus, under the explanation of CARBON, it is stated that “in\r\ncombination with oxygen (21) it forms carbonic acid (26), and that it is\r\nthe chief component part of pit─coal (217), petroleum (213), and other\r\nbituminous substances.” By a reference to the numbers inserted, each of\r\nthe words, against which they stand, will be explained: whilst at least\r\nthree of them would otherwise have been incomprehensible by the\r\ngenerality of unscientific readers.\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked that the reader will not here find an account of\r\nevery production of nature, which is employed for the use of man, nor\r\neven all the uses of such objects as are described. The most important\r\nof the productions, and the principal of the uses, are all that he\r\ntrusts can reasonably be required in a work of the present extent. On\r\nthis ground it is that a great number of animals, which are in request\r\nonly for food, have been wholly omitted.\r\n\r\nThe figures that are inserted have been drawn upon as small and\r\neconomical a scale as was compatible with a sufficiently accurate\r\nrepresentation of the objects to which they relate. If the reader be\r\ndesirous of reference to further illustration, he will derive much\r\nsatisfaction from the invaluable figures of Mr. Sowerby in his British\r\nand Exotic Mineralogy, and English Botany, and Woodville’s Medical\r\nBotany; as well as from those in Dr. Shaw’s General Zoology, and\r\nBewick’s Histories of Quadrupeds and British Birds. There are also many\r\nfigures of useful animals in the author’s own work, entitled “Memoirs of\r\nBritish Quadrupeds.”\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\n                                 TO THE\r\n\r\n                             THIRD EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this work was first printed, the author has made in it\r\nconsiderable improvements. The first volume, particularly, contains many\r\nadditional articles, and more than half of it has been re─written. The\r\nplates also have been re─engraved. For the plate of the mountains a new\r\ndrawing has been made, that the scale might be extended, and many\r\nparticulars might be introduced which before were omitted. For the\r\nplates of vegetables every drawing has been corrected; and, in place of\r\nsuch figures as were most defective, new ones have been inserted.\r\n\r\n  Charlotte─street, Bloomsbury,\r\n  London, 1st March, 1821.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES\r\n\r\n                                 OF THE\r\n\r\n                             FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n                             FRONTISPIECE.\r\n\r\n                  This is explained in pages 236, 237.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PLATE I.\r\n\r\n              Fig.            MINERAL DEPOSITS.\r\n                1.

MINERALS are natural bodies destitute of organization and life: and\r\nMINERALOGY is that branch of natural science which treats of the\r\nproperties and relations of such bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MINERAL DEPOSITS.\r\n\r\n2. If we penetrate beneath the surface of the earth, we observe there a\r\nvery remarkable arrangement. Instead of a generally uniform appearance,\r\nas we see on the surface, we pass through divers substances, as clay,\r\ngravel, sand, and numerous others, deposited in _beds_ or _strata_ of\r\nvarious thickness, from a few inches to a great many feet (Pl. I. Fig.\r\n1). These lie, for the most part, nearly horizontal: but in some\r\ninstances, particularly in mountainous countries, they take different\r\ndegrees of inclination; and, in places where the country consists of\r\ngently sloping hills and vales, the beds have a waving or bending form\r\n(Pl. 1, Fig. 3). The strata of which the earth is composed, as deep as\r\nthe curiosity or the necessities of mankind have induced them to\r\nexplore, satisfactorily demonstrate the wisdom which has been displayed\r\nin the arrangement of materials requisite for the use of men and\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe first layer is frequently a rich, black mould, formed almost wholly\r\nof animal and vegetable remains. This yields sustenance to the vegetable\r\nproductions; and thereby becomes the actual, though not the immediate,\r\nsupport of the whole animal creation.—Beneath this is often found a\r\nthick bed of clay, that furnishes to man a substance of which to make\r\nbricks, tiles, various kinds of pottery, and innumerable other articles\r\nfor the comfort of social life.—Next are deposited vast beds of gravel,\r\nthat are of use in numerous points of view.—Underneath this are the\r\ninfinitely varying strata of sandstone, limestone, &c. which not only\r\nserve for the construction of buildings, and for other important\r\npurposes, but also frequently surround mines which contain the valuable\r\nmetals.—Beneath a slaty stratum are usually discovered those immense\r\nbeds of coal so requisite for the comfort, and, in some situations, even\r\nfor the existence of man.\r\n\r\nThese strata, it is true, are not always found together, nor are they\r\nalways discovered in the same order; but the statement will suffice to\r\nshow the general nature of their arrangement.\r\n\r\n3. Minerals are sometimes observed in detached _masses_ of various size,\r\nand situated at various depths in the earth (Pl. I, Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n4. They are also found in a kind of natural clefts which cross the\r\nregular mineral beds or strata in different directions (Pl. I, Fig. 1,\r\n_a_, Pl. I, Fig. 4, _b_). When these contain metallic ores, they are\r\nstyled _veins_; but when they contain only stony or earthy matters, the\r\nminers call them _dykes_. They vary much both in magnitude and length.\r\nSix thousand feet are considered an unusual length for veins, though, in\r\nsome instances, veins have been traced upwards of four miles. Few veins\r\nextend more than 1200 feet below the surface of the mountains in which\r\nthey are situated. They are usually much inclined; but they sometimes\r\ndescend in a direction parallel with the beds of rock in which they\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n5. At the places where dykes or veins pass through the earth, they\r\noccasionally disjoint the strata in a very singular manner (Pl. I, Fig.\r\n4). Some of the coal strata, for instance, are thrown down or raised on\r\none side of a dyke upwards of a hundred yards; and the miner, after\r\npenetrating through this dyke, instead of finding the same coal again,\r\nmeets, on the opposite side, with beds of stone or clay. Hence he is\r\nfrequently at a loss how to proceed in searching for the coal of which\r\nhe is in pursuit; and hence it is that to such dykes the peculiar name\r\nof _faults_ has sometimes been given.\r\n\r\n6. In England the _metallic ores_ are generally found in veins, that\r\nform a considerable angle with the regular strata. This in Cornwall is\r\nuniformly the case. And it is remarkable, concerning the veins of tin\r\nand copper of that county, that they run in a direction nearly east and\r\nwest; whilst the dykes, or veins of other substances, run for the most\r\npart north and south.\r\n\r\n7. The thickness of veins, and the quantity and quality of the ores they\r\ncontain, differ in every mine. Some are only a few inches wide, whilst\r\nothers extend to the width of several feet. The vein at Dalcooth mine,\r\nin Cornwall, varies from two or three to forty feet and upwards; and, in\r\nsome parts, it contracts so as to be little more than six inches across.\r\n\r\n8. In Cornwall the first traces of tin and copper are usually found at\r\nthe surface of the ground, and thence to the depth of 80 or 100 feet\r\nbeneath; and it is said that no miner has ever yet seen the bottom of a\r\nvein, although several have been wrought to the depth of more than 1000\r\nfeet. The veins of these metals have, in some instances, been worked to\r\nthe length of three or four miles.\r\n\r\n9. It is frequently observed that metallic veins are separated, from the\r\nsubstances they intersect, by a thin wall, or lining, of minerals\r\ndifferent from these substances, and also by a layer of clay on each\r\nside of the vein. It is also remarked that the same substance which\r\nforms the outer coat of the vein is often intermixed with the ore, or\r\nforms layers alternately with it. This has usually the denomination of\r\n_matrix_ or _gangue_.\r\n\r\n10. There are few mines of any considerable depth that would not be\r\nflooded with _water_ from internal springs were not means adopted for\r\ndrawing off this fluid. The steam engines that are employed for this\r\npurpose in some of the Cornish mines are so powerful as to discharge\r\nincessantly, both by night and day, a quantity of water, equal to at\r\nleast 1000 gallons, or near twenty hogsheads, every minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SYSTEMATIC ARRANGEMENT OF MINERALS.\r\n\r\n11. To a superficial observer, perhaps nothing would appear more easy\r\nthan to describe a mineral. This, however, is by no means the case. The\r\nsame general appearance sometimes prevails in substances that are very\r\ndifferent from each other; and the same stone, in its different states,\r\nis often extremely varied in its appearance. To these difficulties it\r\nmust be added, that the combinations of mineral substances are\r\nmultiplied to a great extent. A little application, however,\r\nparticularly if the student be possessed of a collection of arranged and\r\nnamed specimens, which he will have no difficulty in procuring at a\r\nreasonable price, will enable him to overcome all the obstacles that\r\notherwise might impede his progress in beginning to acquire a knowledge\r\nof this interesting science.[1]\r\n\r\n12. The most simple and natural division of minerals is into four\r\nclasses, of, 1. STONES; 2. SALTS; 3. COMBUSTIBLES; and, 4. METALS; and\r\nthe following table, which has chiefly been arranged from the system of\r\nWerner, the well─known German mineralogist, will exhibit a tolerably\r\ncorrect outline of the classification of these substances. To reduce the\r\nwhole within the compass of a single page, many of the families,\r\nhowever, have necessarily been omitted.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Such collections are supplied by Mr. Mawe, No. 149, Strand, London.\r\n  His terms, for collections containing from 100 to 200 specimens, are 5\r\n  guineas; from 200 to 300 specimens, 10 guineas; and from 300 to 400\r\n  specimens, 15 guineas. For collections containing from 350 to 400\r\n  specimens, more select, and comprising a better suite of precious\r\n  stones, he charges from 20 to 30 guineas; and for larger collections,\r\n  from 50 to 100 guineas. At the particular request of the author, Mr.\r\n  Mawe has arranged a few collections of minerals, and numbered them in\r\n  such manner as to correspond with, and illustrate the present volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      PRINCIPAL SPECIES.\r\n                                        { Diamond.     _Diamond_.\r\n                                        {\r\n                                        { Zircon.      _Jargoon_.\r\n                                        {\r\n                                        {            { _Oriental sapphire_.\r\n                                        { Ruby.      { _Oriental ruby_.\r\n                              { Scratch {            { _Emery_.\r\n                              { glass. {\r\n                              {         { Schorl.    { _Topaz_.\r\n                              {         {            { _Emerald_.\r\n                              {\r\n                              {         { Garnet.      _Precious garnet_.\r\n                              {\r\n                              {         {            { _Crystal_.\r\n                              {         { Quartz.    { _Flint_.\r\n              { I.

For the purpose of ascertaining the names and characters of\r\nminerals, attention must be paid to their _form_, _surface_, _lustre_,\r\n_fracture_, or the appearance of their internal surface when broken;\r\n_structure_, _transparence_, _streak_, or the mark left when scratched\r\nby any hard body; _stain_, or trace left when rubbed upon paper;\r\n_cohesion_, whether solid, friable, or fluid: _hardness_, or the\r\nresistance which they oppose when scratched; _tenacity_, or the\r\nresistance which they oppose to the stroke of a hammer; _flexibility_,\r\nor their property of bending without breaking; _feel_, or the sensation\r\ncommunicated by their surfaces when handled; _smell_, _taste_,\r\n_adherence to the tongue_, _sound_, _specific gravity_, or weight in\r\ncomparison with that of water; _colour_ and _electricity_.\r\n\r\n15. To ascertain the _chemical properties_ of minerals, one of the most\r\nimportant instruments is the blow─pipe. This is a tube which terminates\r\nin a cavity as fine as a small wire, and through which the air is\r\nforced, and made to play upon the flame of a candle. The flame is thus\r\nconcentrated, and directed against small particles of the mineral to be\r\nexamined, which is placed upon a bit of charcoal in a spoon of platina\r\nor silver. The air is forced into the blow─pipe by the mouth of the\r\nperson using it, or by bellows attached to it for that purpose. Under\r\nthis operation we have an opportunity of trying the action of other\r\nbodies upon minerals at a very high temperature; and the properties\r\nwhich these experiments bring into view enable us, in many cases, to\r\nascertain, not only the nature, but even the component parts, of\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SIMPLE MINERAL SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n16. As a necessary introduction to the study of minerals, it is\r\nrequisite to describe, in a brief manner, such simple substances as form\r\ntheir constituent parts. Few of these, it is true, are to be found in a\r\nseparate, uncombined state; yet that they do exist, and that they are to\r\nbe obtained from the minerals with which they are united, we have the\r\nproof of every day’s experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          UNCONFINABLE FLUIDS.\r\n\r\n17. There are some kinds of unconfinable fluids, the existence even of\r\nwhich is manifested only by their contact with other bodies, or becoming\r\nseparated from them. They are of a nature too subtile to be collected or\r\nconfined in our vessels for the purpose of examination, and the\r\ninvestigation of their properties has consequently been attended with\r\npeculiar difficulty. Those at present known are _caloric_, _light_,\r\n_electricity_, and _magnetism_; but of these the first only is\r\nimmediately connected with the subjects of our present investigation.\r\n\r\n18. _Caloric_.—Every one is acquainted with the different sensations of\r\nheat and cold. That matter which produces on our bodies the sensation of\r\n_heat_ has the name of _Caloric_; heat being only an effect, of which\r\ncaloric is the cause. This is extended in a greater or less degree\r\nthrough the whole extent of space, and penetrates into the interior of\r\neven the most solid bodies: in so doing it expands the particles of\r\nwhich they are composed, augments their bulk, and diminishes their\r\nsolidity. The sun is the principal fountain from which the earth is\r\nsupplied with this fluid; and it passes thence to us at the rate of\r\n12,000,000 of miles per minute. The defect of caloric in any substance\r\noccasions the sensation called cold.\r\n\r\nWere the world deprived of caloric, every species of organized being\r\nwould, from that moment, cease to exist. It is the cause of all\r\nfluidity: to it every production of the earth has been most essentially\r\nindebted, even for its form and structure; and in no respect do the\r\npower and goodness of the Almighty appear more conspicuous than in the\r\ncreation, dispersion, and continuance, of this most subtile and\r\nastonishing fluid.\r\n\r\n19. All the various substances with which we are acquainted must be\r\nconsidered either as solid or fluid. Every substance is defined to be a\r\n_solid_ in which the parts are so united or connected that it requires\r\nan external force to separate them. A _fluid_, on the contrary, is a\r\nbody the parts of which are so loosely connected that they not only\r\nyield easily to any force impressed upon them, but also move freely\r\namongst each other; and every fluid is a combination of caloric with\r\nsome other substance.\r\n\r\n20. Fluids are of two kinds: one of these, called _liquids_, have, when\r\nat rest, a smooth and distinct surface, and are distinguishable both by\r\nthe sight and touch; the other, denominated _gas_, or _gaseous fluids_,\r\nhave the appearance of air, and are not perceptible either to the sight\r\nor touch, except under certain circumstances. The latter are principally\r\noxygen (21), azote or nitrogen, and hydrogen (45). We shall at present\r\nhave occasion to speak only of the first.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GASEOUS FLUIDS.\r\n\r\n21. _Oxygen_, like caloric, is a fluid never found in an uncombined\r\nstate. It forms one of the component parts of the air that we breathe,\r\nand of the water we drink; but it approaches nearest to a state of\r\npurity in combination with caloric (18), when it has the name of _oxygen\r\ngas_. It was formerly called _vital air_, because no breathing animal\r\ncan live for a moment in any air or gas which has not in it a mixture of\r\noxygen; every kind of combustible burns with great splendour in it, and\r\nwithout it ceases to burn. It unites with a great number of substances,\r\nand changes both their appearance and properties in a very remarkable\r\nmanner. Of the metals it entirely destroys the metallic lustre, and\r\ngives them an earthy form and texture. Substances in this state have the\r\nname of _oxides_.\r\n\r\nLead, for instance, combined with oxygen becomes the well─known red and\r\nheavy substance used by painters, under the name of minium or red lead\r\n(239). This, if deprived of its oxygen, loses its red colour, and\r\nreturns to its former metallic state. Some of the metals are oxidized by\r\nmerely being exposed to moisture. Thus the rust which is so readily\r\ncontracted by iron is an oxide of that metal, produced by its attracting\r\noxygen from the air or from water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ACIDS.\r\n\r\n22. It is one of the most remarkable properties of oxygen to impart to\r\nmost of those bodies called _acids_ their peculiar character of acidity.\r\nOxygen does not itself possess the properties of an acid, nor is it an\r\nessential ingredient in all acids, though it is the acidifying principle\r\nin the greater number of them.\r\n\r\n23. _Acid_ is a word originally synonymous with sour. It has, however,\r\nbeen gradually extended in its signification, and now comprehends all\r\nsubstances possessed of the properties of exciting upon the tongue the\r\nsensation called sour; of changing the blue colours of vegetables to\r\nred; of uniting with water in almost any proportion; of combining with\r\nalkalies (42), metallic oxides, and earths, and of forming with them\r\ncertain compounds called _salts_.\r\n\r\n24. _Sulphuric Acid_, or _Spirit of Vitriol_, as it is commonly called,\r\nis a liquid of a somewhat oily consistence, transparent and colourless\r\nas water, formed by a combination of oxygen (21) with sulphur (46). Like\r\nother acids, it never occurs in nature in a pure state, for it can no\r\nsooner be formed than it unites with earths (31), alkalies (42), or\r\nmetals, and forms, with them, several well─known salts, which have the\r\nname of _sulphats_. Thus alabaster (192) and Epsom salts (199) are\r\nrespectively formed by an union of sulphuric acid with lime and\r\nmagnesia, and are denominated by chemists sulphat of lime and sulphat of\r\nmagnesia. In like manner, blue vitriol (209) is sulphat of copper; green\r\nvitriol (208), sulphat of iron; and white vitriol (210), sulphat of\r\nzinc.\r\n\r\n25. _Phosphoric Acid_ is produced by a combination of oxygen (21) with\r\nphosphorus (47); and, when obtained in a state of purity, is not a\r\nfluid, but a white and flaky substance. This acid, when combined with\r\nmineral productions, forms those salts which have the name of\r\n_phosphats_. It is very soluble in water; and, in dissolving, makes a\r\nhissing noise, similar to that produced by plunging hot iron into water.\r\n\r\n26. _Carbonic Acid_ is a compound of oxygen (21) and carbon, or pure\r\ncharcoal (48): and in a state of gas (20) it forms a constituent part of\r\nthe atmospheric air. It is also emitted in great abundance from wine,\r\nbeer, and other liquors, in a state of fermentation, and is sometimes\r\nfound in the lowest parts of mines, where it is known to the miners by\r\nthe name of _choke damp_, from the circumstance of its immediately\r\nextinguishing flame, and suffocating all animals that are immersed in\r\nit. This gas, which was formerly called by chemists _fixed air_, is\r\nabout twice the weight of common air. In combination with lime it forms\r\nchalk, marble, and limestone; and it constitutes part of several other\r\nmineral substances, which are thence denominated _carbonats_.\r\n\r\n27. _Fluoric Acid_ is a gas of very singular nature, which is held in\r\ncombination with lime, in the Derbyshire or fluor spar (194); and may be\r\nseparated from it by pouring sulphuric acid, or spirit of vitriol (24),\r\nupon powdered spar, in a leaden vessel called a retort, and applying to\r\nit a gentle heat. The salts formed by fluoric acid have the name of\r\n_fluats_.\r\n\r\n28. The _Boracic_ is a peculiar kind of acid, which, in combination with\r\nsoda (200), forms the substance that we import from the East Indies\r\nunder the name of borax (204). When extracted from borax this acid does\r\nnot assume the form of a fluid, but appears in thin six─sided scales or\r\nflakes, of white colour, which adhere slightly together, and feel\r\nsomewhat greasy in handling. To the taste it is at first sour, then\r\nbitterish; and at last it leaves an agreeable sweetness on the palate.\r\n\r\n29. _Muriatic Acid_ is a gas formed by the combination of oxygen (21)\r\nwith some base that is not yet known. It is an invisible and elastic\r\nfluid, which, in mechanical properties, resembles common air, and has a\r\npungent and very peculiar smell. This gas unites with alkalies (42),\r\nearths (31), and the oxides (21) of metals; and with them forms the\r\ncompounds called _muriats_, of which common salt, or muriat of soda\r\n(202), is one of the principal. The liquid muriatic acid, or muriatic\r\nacid gas combined with water, is frequently denominated _spirit of salt_\r\n(202).\r\n\r\n30. _Nitric Acid_ is a compound of oxygen and azote, or nitrogen, in the\r\nproportion of twenty─five parts, by weight, of the latter to\r\nseventy─five of the former. It is one of the constituent parts of nitre,\r\nor saltpetre (206); and, in a pure state, is transparent and colourless,\r\nlike water. By the action of light, however, it soon becomes yellow;\r\nand, if exposed to the air, it emits yellow fumes, which even tinge the\r\nair of the same colour. To the taste it is extremely acid. It dyes the\r\nskin a yellow colour, which is very difficult to be removed; and it is\r\nso corrosive as to destroy almost every substance into which it\r\npenetrates. If poured upon oils, it sets them on fire. With various\r\nbases it forms compounds called _nitrats_. This acid, which hitherto has\r\nnever otherwise been obtained than mixed with water, is chiefly known in\r\ncommerce by the name of _aqua fortis_ (206).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EARTHS.\r\n\r\n31. The solid contents of the globe are composed of several elementary\r\nsubstances, amongst which have been enumerated no fewer than nine\r\ndifferent kinds of earth:\r\n\r\n    1. Silex.\r\n    2. Alumine.\r\n    3. Zircon.\r\n    4. Glucine.\r\n    5. Yttria.\r\n    6. Barytes.\r\n    7. Strontian.\r\n    8. Lime.\r\n    9. Magnesia.\r\n\r\nThese, when freed from foreign admixture, are, for the most part, of\r\nwhite colour, not soluble in water, not combustible, and do not exceed\r\nfour times the weight of water.\r\n\r\n32. The whole of these earths have, till lately, been considered simple\r\nand uncombined substances; but, by the discoveries of Sir Humphrey Davy,\r\nit has been ascertained that four of them have a metallic basis, and are\r\nin fact metallic oxides, or compounds consisting of a metal united with\r\noxygen (21). These, which have the same affinity with their respective\r\nbases as rust has to iron, are silex, lime, barytes, and alumine. Until,\r\nhowever, some further light be thrown upon their nature and\r\nconstitution, they must continue to hold their former situation of\r\nsimple earths.\r\n\r\n33. _Silex_, or _Siliceous Earth_, is the basis of all substances known\r\nby the name of quartz and silex (76). In a state of nature it has never\r\nbeen found pure; but, in combination with other substances, it abounds\r\nin almost every country of the globe. Common flint (90) contains\r\nninety─seven parts in a hundred of silex: it consequently has given its\r\nname to this earth, _silex_ being the Latin word for flint. When\r\npurified it is a white powder, the particles of which are harsh to the\r\ntouch, as if they consisted of very minute grains of sand. It is not\r\nquite three times as heavy as water, and has neither taste nor smell.\r\nWater will not dissolve it, nor any kind of acid, except fluoric. Sir H.\r\nDavy has discovered it to have a metallic basis, to which he has given\r\nthe name of _silicium_.\r\n\r\n34. _Alumine_ is a kind of earth, so called from its forming the basis\r\nof alum (197). It is soft, compact, and tenacious; about twice the\r\nweight of water, and, when breathed upon, has a smell which is peculiar\r\nto all clayey productions. In the fire it shrinks, and becomes so hard\r\nas even to yield sparks when struck against steel. It readily absorbs\r\nwater, and is dissolved by most acids. Some writers state that pure\r\nalumine has been discovered in a native state near Halle, in Germany. It\r\nis found in a crystallized form, and nearly in a state of purity, in the\r\nOriental ruby and sapphire. The name of _argil_, or clay, has sometimes\r\nbeen applied to it; but, in mineralogy, this name has usually been given\r\nto a mixture of alum, quartz, and other substances. Sir H. Davy has\r\nobtained from alumine a metallic basis, called _aluminum_.\r\n\r\n35. _Zircon_, when freed from those substances with which it is\r\ncombined, is a white and somewhat rough powder, insipid to the taste,\r\ninsoluble in water, and about four times as heavy as that fluid. It is\r\nfound in the two kinds of precious stones called jargoon and hyacinth,\r\nand has not hitherto been applied to any useful purpose.\r\n\r\n36. _Glucine_ is a kind of earth of peculiar nature, which is found in\r\nthe emerald and beryl, and, when purified, forms a soft and white\r\npowder, without smell, and of sweetish taste. To the last of these\r\nqualities it is indebted for its name, which is derived from a Greek\r\nword signifying sweet. It is somewhat unctuous to the touch, and about\r\nthree times as heavy as water. The uses of this earth, whatever they may\r\nbe, are not known.\r\n\r\n37. _Yttria_ is an earth which, among other particulars, differs from\r\nglucine by its weight, as it is nearly five times heavier than water. In\r\na natural state it occurs as the basis of a black Swedish mineral,\r\ncalled gadolinite. When cleansed, by chemical process, from all its\r\nimpurities, it is a fine, white, and inodorous powder.\r\n\r\n38. _Barytes_ is a white, porous, and very heavy earth, which can only\r\nbe obtained pure by chemical process. It is easily reduced to powder,\r\nand is soluble in all kinds of acids. To the taste it is harsh and\r\ncaustic; and, if taken into the stomach, proves an extremely virulent\r\npoison. In some respects it agrees with the alkalies (42), particularly\r\nin its property of changing blue vegetable colours to green, and in\r\ncorroding, like them, though with less energy, all kinds of animal\r\nsubstances. From these circumstances it has sometimes been denominated\r\nan alkaline earth. Saturated with sulphuric (24) and carbonic acid (26),\r\nit constitutes the minerals denominated sulphat and carbonat of barytes\r\n(196). It has been discovered to have a metallic base, which is called\r\n_barium_.\r\n\r\n39. _Strontian_ is an earth which, like barytes, is not found otherwise\r\nthan in combination with sulphuric and carbonic acids. It occurs in\r\nvarious parts of the world, and, when purified, forms a porous mass of\r\ngreyish white colour, acrid taste, and somewhat alkaline nature. This\r\nearth converts vegetable blue colours to green, but does not act so\r\nstrongly on animal bodies as barytes, nor is it poisonous, like that\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n40. _Lime_, the basis of all those substances which are denominated\r\n_calcareous_, is only to be obtained in a state of purity by artificial\r\nprocess. Combined with carbonic acid (26) it forms limestone (140),\r\nchalk, and marble; all of which are capable of being converted into lime\r\nby burning. Lime may also be obtained from oyster and other sea shells.\r\nWhen pure, it is of white colour, and moderately hard substance, though\r\nit is easily reducible to powder. Its taste is burning and acrid; and,\r\nlike the alkalies, it changes vegetable blue colours to green. It has\r\nlikewise the property of corroding and destroying animal substances.\r\nLime, when pure, absorbs water rapidly, becomes hot, and falls into\r\npowder. Even if exposed to the open air it gradually attracts moisture,\r\nand assumes a powdery form; soon after which it becomes saturated with\r\ncarbonic acid (26) from the atmosphere, and is thereby again converted\r\ninto carbonat of lime (140). It occurs abundantly in almost every\r\ncountry, but always in combination with some acid, carbonic (26),\r\nsulphuric (24), boracic (28), fluoric (27), or phosphoric (25). This\r\nsubstance has a metallic basis, which has been denominated _calcium_.\r\n\r\n41. _Magnesia_ is a light and perfectly white kind of earth, of soft\r\npowdery appearance, without taste or smell, and somewhat more than twice\r\nas heavy as water. It is not found in this pure state in nature, but may\r\nbe prepared from Epsom salt, which consists of magnesia in union with\r\nsulphuric acid (24). The slightly acrid taste that is perceptible in the\r\nmagnesia used in medicine arises from a portion of lime which it\r\ncontains. This substance does not dissolve in water, but is soluble in\r\nevery kind of acid. It has the property of changing delicate blue\r\ncolours to green.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ALKALIES.\r\n\r\n42. Alkalies are substances which enter into the composition of several\r\nkinds of minerals, and are known by their property of changing the\r\ncolour of blue vegetable juices to green, and by a peculiarly acrid,\r\ncaustic, and nauseous taste, which it is impossible to describe, but\r\nwhich, after it has been once experienced, will easily be recollected.\r\nAlkalies corrode and dissolve animal substances, and unite with oil and\r\nfat in such manner as to form the well known compound called soap. They\r\nreadily dissolve in water; and, when mixed with acids, form what have\r\nbeen denominated neutral salts.\r\n\r\n43. The alkalies at present known are three in number; _potash_ (205),\r\n_soda_ (200), and _ammonia_ (207). Of these the two former, although\r\ntill lately they have been considered simple substances, have been shown\r\nby Sir H. Davy to have metallic bases.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SIMPLE COMBUSTIBLES.\r\n\r\n44. By this term we are to understand all those mineral substances,\r\ncapable of combustion, which have not been discovered to consist of more\r\nthan a single component part. They are four in number; _hydrogen_,\r\n_sulphur_, _phosphorus_, and _carbon_.\r\n\r\n45. _Hydrogen_, as its name imports, is a principal constituent part of\r\nwater; for, singular as it may appear, that well─known fluid is formed\r\nby a combination of two species of air or gas, called hydrogen and\r\noxygen (21), and in the proportion of about fifteen parts of the former\r\nand eighty─five parts of the latter. This gas had formerly the\r\ndenomination of _inflammable air_, and has long been known in mines\r\nunder the name of _fire─damp_. It is about twelve times lighter than\r\natmospheric air. When pure it soon destroys such animals, and\r\nextinguishes all such flaming substances, as are immersed in it. Mixed\r\nwith atmospheric air, it explodes with great violence on the application\r\nof any ignited body.\r\n\r\n46. _Sulphur_ is a simple combustible substance, of yellow colour, which\r\nis found pure, or native, in several parts of the world, and is\r\nsufficiently familiar to us under the name of _brimstone_ (211). It\r\nstrongly attracts oxygen (21), and is thereby converted into sulphuric\r\nacid (24). It frequently occurs in combination with mineral substances,\r\nsuch as arsenic, antimony, copper, and other metallic ores.\r\n\r\n47. _Phosphorus_ is a combustible substance which, when pure, somewhat\r\nresembles bees’─wax both in colour and consistence; and, when exposed to\r\nthe air under the usual temperature of our atmosphere, is luminous in\r\nthe dark, and has a smell somewhat resembling that of garlic. It is so\r\ncombustible that, when melted, it should be kept under water, as it\r\ncannot be exposed to the air during this process without great risk of\r\ncatching fire. This substance is not known in a native state; and the\r\nwhole of what is used in philosophy and commerce is obtained by\r\ndifferent artificial processes. In union with oxygen (21) it becomes\r\nconverted into an acid, called _phosphoric acid_ (25), and, under this\r\nform, in conjunction with lime, it constitutes the bones of men and\r\nanimals. The greater part of the phosphorus of the shops is obtained\r\nfrom bones.\r\n\r\n48. _Carbon_ is a name given to the pure inflammable part of charcoal.\r\nIt is abundantly diffused throughout nature, for it enters into the\r\ncomposition of several minerals, and of all vegetable and animal bodies.\r\nThe purest form under which carbon is known to exist is in the diamond\r\n(50). It may, however, be obtained sufficiently pure, for all common\r\npurposes, by burning a piece of wood, covered with sand, in a vessel\r\ncalled a crucible. In combination with oxygen (21) it forms carbonic\r\nacid (26). Carbon is a chief component part of pit─coal (217), petroleum\r\n(213), and other bituminous substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CLASS I.—STONES.\r\n\r\n                        ORDER I.—EARTHY STONES.\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n                 _I.

OF GEMS IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\nGems, or precious stones, as they are frequently called, are, for the\r\nmost part, transparent, and have a vitreous or glassy appearance. Their\r\ndifferent colours are occasioned by metallic oxides (21) of various\r\nkinds, with which they are impregnated. Some writers have classed them\r\nby their colours, but this is a very uncertain mode, as different gems\r\nhave not unfrequently the same colour; and, in many cases, the same gems\r\nare of different colours. The usual distinction of gems into Oriental\r\nand Occidental is also liable to error, as the best gems, from whatever\r\npart of the world they are brought, are always called Oriental. The most\r\nestimable of all the kinds are the diamond (50), ruby (54), emerald\r\n(67), and sapphire (53); and stones a grain in weight, and equal in\r\nquality, are valued in the following proportions, at 8_l._ per carat for\r\ndiamonds, 4_l._ for rubies, and 3_l._ for each of the others. The\r\namethyst (79), topaz (61), and aqua─marine (61), are considered of\r\nnearly equal value with each other; and the garnet (70) is the cheapest\r\nof precious stones.\r\n\r\nThe ancients engraved upon several kinds of gems; but they appear to\r\nhave been ignorant of the art of cutting the diamond, the ruby, and the\r\nsapphire, which were too hard for them to operate upon. The emerald and\r\nthe noble opal (102) were too highly esteemed as precious stones to have\r\noften found their way into the hands of engravers. It has been asserted\r\nthat the ancients did not use the topaz for engraving; but there is\r\nextant a beautiful _intaglio_, representing an Indian Bacchus, which is\r\nsaid to be a topaz. The garnet was often engraved upon: and there are\r\nmany master─pieces of the art in calcedony (91) and carnelian (93.) Onyx\r\nand sardonyx (92) were employed for that species of engraving in relief\r\ncalled _cameos_; and, in many instances, it is pleasing to observe with\r\nwhat dexterity the ancient artists availed themselves of the different\r\ncolours in the alternate zones to express the different parts and shades\r\nof their figures.\r\n\r\nMost of the gems may be imitated by artificial preparations of glass,\r\ncoloured by different metallic substances; and it is not easy, by mere\r\ninspection, to distinguish the better kinds of factitious stones from\r\nreal gems. They are, however, discoverable by a deficiency of lustre,\r\nand being so soft as, even in the most perfect kinds, to yield to the\r\npoint of a steel instrument.\r\n\r\nThe cutting and polishing of gems is the work of the lapidary, and is in\r\ngeneral thus performed:—The shape most proper to be given to any\r\nparticular gem being determined on, the stone is cemented to the end of\r\na stick, and the different facets are formed by a mill contrived for the\r\npurpose. This mill is a plate of copper, or an alloy of lead and tin, to\r\nwhich an horizontal motion is given by very simple machinery, and the\r\nsurface of which is charged either with diamond powder and oil, or with\r\nfine emery and water. A thick peg of wood called a gauge, pierced with\r\nsmall holes in all directions, is set upright on the lapidary’s bench,\r\nclose to the mill, and the process of shaping the facets thus takes\r\nplace. The stone is placed on the surface of the mill, the opposite end\r\nof the stick to which it is cemented being inserted in one of the holes\r\nof the gauge. In this position it is kept steady by the workman, with\r\nhis right hand, whilst, with the other, he puts the mill in motion. The\r\nskill of the lapidary depends on regulating the velocity of the mill,\r\nand pressing with more or less force on the stick, with an almost\r\nimperceptible tendency to one or other direction in different stages of\r\nthe work, examining each facet at very short intervals, in order to give\r\nas great precision as possible to its size and form. This part of the\r\nbusiness being completed, the cutting mill is taken out, and replaced by\r\none of brass, on which the polishing is performed by means of fine emery\r\n(58), tripoli, and rotten stone (119), exactly in the same manner as is\r\npractised in the first stage of the process for setting the facets.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DIAMOND.\r\n\r\n50. _The DIAMOND, or ADAMANT of the ancients, is the most valuable of\r\ngems, and the hardest of all known bodies; when pure, it is perfectly\r\ntransparent._\r\n\r\n_In a rough state, diamonds have usually either the form of rounded\r\npebbles, with a shining surface, or they are crystallized in the shape\r\nof octohedrons, or double four─sided pyramids. (Pl. II, Fig. 5, 6.)\r\nThough for the most part colourless, they are sometimes yellow, green,\r\nblue, blackish, or rose─coloured._\r\n\r\nThe best diamonds are brought from the East Indies. The principal mines\r\nare those of Raolconda and Coulour, in the province of Golconda; and\r\nthat of Soumelpour, or Goual, in Bengal. At Raolconda they are found in\r\nthe deep crevices of rocks. Persons, by means of long iron rods, with\r\nhooks at the end, draw out from these crevices the loose contents, and\r\nafterwards wash them in tubs, for the purpose of discovering the\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nThe first discovery of diamonds at Coulour was about two centuries ago,\r\nby a countryman, who, on digging his ground to sow millet, accidentally\r\nfound one of these stones of large size. From that period the whole\r\nadjacent plain began to be searched to the depth of from ten to fourteen\r\nfeet; and the work was, at one time, so extensively pursued, that nearly\r\n6,000 persons were employed in it. At Soumelpour the diamonds are found\r\namongst the sand and gravel of the river.\r\n\r\nDiamonds are likewise found in the island of Borneo, and in several\r\nparts of South America. The mode by which they are obtained from one of\r\nthe rivers of Brazil has been described by Mr. Mawe. The current is\r\nturned, and part of the bed of the river being laid dry, the mud is\r\ntaken up and washed, by negroes, in places prepared for the purpose,\r\nthrough which a portion only of the stream is allowed to flow. As soon\r\nas all the earthy particles have been washed away, the gravel─like\r\nmatter that remains is raked together, the stones are thrown out, and\r\nwhat diamonds happen to be present are found amongst the refuse that is\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain whether a stone, that has been found, be really a diamond,\r\nthe workmen have a mode of placing it upon a hard substance, and\r\nstriking it with a hammer. If it either resists the blow or separate\r\ninto leaves, it must be a diamond; but, in the latter case, the\r\ndiscovery is sometimes made at an immense expense, as, by thus\r\ndiminishing the size, its value must also, of course, be greatly\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nDiamonds are generally exported from Madras in a rough state; and in\r\nsmall parcels neatly sewed in muslin, and sealed by the merchants who\r\nsend them. These, we are informed by Mr. Milburne in his valuable work\r\non oriental commerce, are, for the most part, sold in Europe by the\r\ninvoice, as it is called; that is, without being opened: and he says\r\nthat they are always found to contain the value for which they were sold\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nOf all transparent substances, none for brilliancy can be compared with\r\nthe diamond. Its hardness is such, that no steel instrument whatever can\r\nmake any impression upon it. Notwithstanding this, at a temperature not\r\nso high as that which is required for the melting of silver, it\r\ngradually dissipates and burns. Diamonds have been shown to consist\r\nprincipally of carbon or charcoal in a pure and crystallized state.\r\n\r\nThe ancients, ignorant of the art of cutting diamonds, were contented to\r\nset them in a native state; and for this purpose they preferred such\r\nstones as had naturally a crystallized form. The four large diamonds\r\nwhich ornament the clasp of the Imperial mantle of Charlemagne, and\r\nwhich are still preserved in Paris, are uncut stones of this\r\ndescription. The extreme hardness of the diamond baffled all attempts to\r\npolish it in such manner as to exhibit its peculiar beauty, until the\r\nyear 1456, when a young man of Bruges, whose name was Berquin,\r\nendeavoured to polish two diamonds by rubbing them against each other.\r\nHaving succeeded in this, he next constructed a wheel, on which, by\r\nmeans of diamond powder, he was enabled to cut and polish these gems in\r\na manner beyond his greatest expectation. Since this period the art of\r\npolishing them has been greatly improved both by the Dutch and British\r\njewellers.\r\n\r\nIn the choosing and valuing of diamonds in a rough state, attention is\r\npaid to their colour, their being free from extraneous matter, and their\r\nshape. Those that are most perfect are crystalline, and resemble a drop\r\nof clear spring water, in the middle of which is to be perceived a\r\nstrong light, that plays with great spirit on moving them about. When\r\nthey have a yellowish or greenish tinge they are considered to be bad.\r\nMany diamonds have a kind of confused structure, which lapidaries\r\ncompare to knots formed in wood. These are rejected, from the\r\nimpossibility of polishing them properly.\r\n\r\nMr. Mawe remarks that diamonds, when rubbed together, have a peculiarly\r\nand scarcely to be described grating sound, which is one of their most\r\nremarkable characteristics. By this alone rough diamonds may be\r\naccurately and expeditiously distinguished from every other gem.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to cut diamonds into three principal forms, called\r\n_brilliant_ (Pl. II, Fig. 7), _rose_ (Fig. 8), and _table_ diamonds\r\n(Fig. 9). Brilliants are, for the most part, cut from such of the stones\r\nas have naturally a crystallized shape, and rose diamonds from the flat\r\nvarieties. The former are so called from their great lustre, in\r\nconsequence of the facets on both sides being cut. These are always set\r\nupon a black ground, whilst rose diamonds, which are much thinner, are\r\nset upon a white foil speckled with black, for the purpose of adding to\r\ntheir lustre. Rose─cut diamonds are of course much less estimable than\r\nbrilliants; so much so indeed, that of late many of them, brought from\r\nHolland, have been re─cut into brilliants, notwithstanding the\r\nadditional expense, and the loss of size necessarily attendant on this\r\noperation. The table diamond is the least beautiful of any. This mode of\r\ncutting is only adopted for such stones, or rather fragments, as, with a\r\nconsiderable breadth, have only a very trifling depth. The\r\ndiamond─cutters of England are considered to be the best in Europe, but\r\ntheir number is so small as to occasion many stones to be sent to\r\nHolland to be cut.\r\n\r\nThe value of diamonds is ascertained by their weight in carats; and this\r\nvalue increases, in a very high ratio, according to their magnitude. For\r\ninstance, a diamond weighing one carat will be worth about 10_l._ whilst\r\nanother of five carats will be worth 150_l._ and of ten carats\r\n800_l._[2] This rule, however, can only be taken for diamonds of twenty\r\ncarats and under. The larger ones, in consequence of the scarcity of\r\npurchasers, are generally disposed of at prices greatly inferior to\r\ntheir estimated worth. The value of some diamonds that are peculiarly\r\nperfect exceeds the above ratio; whilst, for a stone that is cloudy,\r\nfoul, or of bad colour, even three quarters of the estimated value will\r\nperhaps be deducted.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  A Carat is equal to four jeweller’s grains, seven grains of which are\r\n  equal to six grains troy. To ascertain the value of wrought diamonds\r\n  the weight must be doubled, about half being supposed to be lost in\r\n  the working. This sum must be multiplied into itself, and the product\r\n  by two. Thus to find the value of a diamond of twenty carats 20 × 2 =\r\n  40 × 40 = 1600 × 2 = 3,200_l._\r\n\r\nNo diamonds are so valuable as those that are perfectly transparent, and\r\nof snow─white colour. The green and yellow varieties are, however, much\r\nesteemed: the blue kinds were formerly more valued than at present; and\r\nthe least valuable are those that have a grey or brownish tint. Black\r\ndiamonds are much prized by collectors.\r\n\r\nThe principal use of the diamond is in jewellery. It is also used by\r\nlapidaries, for slitting hard stones, and for cutting and engraving upon\r\nother gems; by clock─makers in the finer kinds of clock─work; in the\r\nglass─trade for squaring large pieces or plates of glass, and among\r\nglaziers for cutting their glass.\r\n\r\nThe largest diamond ever known (if it be such, and not a white topaz, as\r\nsome people have imagined) is in the possession of the Queen of\r\nPortugal, and weighs 1,680 carats, or more than _eleven ounces_. It was\r\nfound in Brazil, and sent to Lisbon in the year 1746. It is still uncut,\r\nand has been valued at 5,644,800_l._\r\n\r\nThe Rajah of Mattan, in the island of Borneo, possesses a large diamond,\r\nshaped like an egg, with an indented hollow near the smaller end. It was\r\nfound in that island about eighty years ago, is said to be of the finest\r\nwater, and to weigh 367 carats, or more than two ounces and a quarter.\r\nSeveral years ago the Governor of Batavia, desirous of purchasing this\r\ngem, sent a Mr. Stuvart to the Rajah, authorizing him to offer for it\r\n150,000 dollars, two large brigs of war, with their guns and ammunition,\r\ntogether with a certain number of great guns, and a quantity of powder\r\nand shot. The Rajah, however, refused to deprive his family of so\r\nvaluable an hereditary possession; for the Malays not only attach to it\r\nthe miraculous power of curing all diseases by means of water in which\r\nit is dipped, but also believe that the fortune of the family is\r\nsustained by its continuing in their possession.\r\n\r\nTavernier, the French Traveller, saw in the possession of the Great\r\nMogul a diamond which weighed near 280 carats. In form and size it\r\nresembled half a hen’s egg. This diamond had been obtained from the mine\r\nof Coulour, about the year 1550; and was valued at more than 700,000_l._\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nThe sceptre of the Emperor of Russia is adorned with an oriental diamond\r\nabout the size of a pigeon’s egg, which weighs 195 carats. This diamond\r\nis said to have once been placed as the eye of an idol in Seringham, in\r\nthe Carnatic. A grenadier, who had deserted from the French service in\r\nIndia, contrived to become one of the priests of the idol, in the hope\r\nof being able to steal this eye. He at length effected his purpose, and\r\nescaped with the diamond to Madras, where he sold it to the captain of a\r\nship for a sum equal to 2,500_l._ of British money. It was afterwards\r\ntransferred to a Jew for 18,000_l._ Coming into the hands of a Greek\r\nmerchant, he offered it for sale at Amsterdam, in 1766; and the Russian\r\nPrince Orloff bought it for the Empress Catharine for about 90,000_l._\r\nsterling, and an annuity of 4,000_l._ during the life of the person who\r\nsold it.\r\n\r\nThe _Pitt_, or _Regent diamond_ (Pl. II, Fig. 10), which lately was set\r\nin the handle of the sword of state of Buonaparte, and is now possessed\r\nby the king of France, is a brilliant of the most beautiful kind, and\r\nweighs 136¾ carats. It was brought from India by Thomas Pitt, Esq.\r\nGovernor of Fort George. Mr. Pitt has himself stated, respecting it,\r\nthat, in December, 1701, whilst resident in Madras, several valuable\r\nstones, in a rough state, were brought to him for sale by an eminent\r\ndiamond merchant. One of these, the diamond here spoken of, was so large\r\nthat the merchant asked for it the sum of 85,000_l._ After much\r\nbargaining, Mr. Pitt purchased it for 20,400_l._ He afterwards sold it\r\nfor 135,000_l._ to the Regent Duke of Orleans; and by him it was placed\r\namong the crown jewels of France.\r\n\r\nThe _Pigot diamond_ weighs forty─seven and a half carats. This, which is\r\nan extremely fine stone, was disposed of by lottery, in 1800, for\r\n22,000_l._; and is now in the possession of Messrs. Rundell and Bridge,\r\njewellers in London.\r\n\r\nA large star, cross, and chain, worn on grand gala days by the Prince of\r\nBrazil, as Sovereign of the different Portuguese orders of knighthood,\r\nare each ornamented with a great number of magnificent diamonds, set in\r\ngold. The centre diamond of the star is alone valued at 800,000_l._\r\n\r\nWhen the diamond is rubbed it will attract bits of straw, feathers,\r\nhairs, and other small objects; and if exposed to the rays of the sun,\r\nand immediately taken into a dark place, some diamonds will appear\r\nluminous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ZIRCON FAMILY.\r\n\r\n51. _JARGOON is a gem usually of smoky yellow or brownish colour, and\r\nsometimes limpid: if placed upon any object, it exhibits of it a very\r\ndistinct double image._\r\n\r\n_The primitive form of its crystal is an octohedron (Pl. II, Fig. 5),\r\nbut it is frequently crystallized in right─angled prisms, terminated by\r\nfour─sided pyramids._\r\n\r\nIn hardness this stone does not much exceed that of the emerald. The\r\ngreyish white and yellowish white varieties of jargoon are valuable\r\nchiefly on account of their resemblance to the diamond. The\r\ndarker─coloured varieties can be deprived of their colour by heat; and,\r\nin this state, though in lustre they are infinitely inferior to them,\r\nthey are sometimes substituted for diamonds. Jargoons are now seldom\r\nused except for the jewelling of watches and time─pieces. About a\r\ncentury ago, they were much used in mourning ornaments, for which the\r\ndark tone of their colour, and their almost adamantine lustre, were\r\nsupposed to be peculiarly appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe jargoon is principally brought from the island of Ceylon; but it is\r\noccasionally found in France, and Spain, and in granite rocks near\r\nCuffel, in Dumfrieshire, Scotland.\r\n\r\n52. _The_ HYACINTH, _or_ JACINTH, _is a dark orange─red variety of\r\njargoon_. It is also chiefly imported from Ceylon, where it is generally\r\nfound in the sand of rivers, in irregularly round pieces, but seldom of\r\nlarge size without flaws.\r\n\r\nThis stone is indebted for its name to a supposed resemblance in colour\r\nto that flower, which, according to the Pagan mythology, Apollo raised\r\nfrom the blood of his favourite youth, Hyacinthus.\r\n\r\nWhen bright, and free from flaws, the hyacinth is a superb ring stone;\r\nbut it is not of usual occurrence in modern jewellery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RUBY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n53. _The ORIENTAL SAPPHIRE is a gem of blue colour, the shades of which\r\nvary from a full and deep tint to a nearly colourless appearance, and\r\nsometimes it is party─coloured._\r\n\r\n_It is found crystallized in six─sided pyramids much lengthened and\r\njoined base to base (Pl. II, Fig. 13); and also in rounded or\r\npebble─shaped fragments. It has a foliated texture, is extremely hard,\r\nand about four times as heavy as water._\r\n\r\nWe are chiefly indebted for the sapphire to the East Indies and the\r\nIsland of Ceylon, where it is found amongst the sand of the rivers. When\r\nbrought into Europe, it is cut by means of diamond powder, and polished\r\nwith emery. It is now usually set with a foil of its own colour; but it\r\nwas formerly the practice, instead of foil, to place under this stone\r\nthe blue part of a peacock’s feather.\r\n\r\nIn hardness the sapphire ranks next to the ruby (54); and in value it is\r\nabout equal to the emerald (67). A good sapphire of ten carats’ weight\r\nis worth about fifty guineas. In the Museum of Natural History at Paris\r\nthere is a sapphire which weighs upwards of sixty─six carats: it was\r\nplaced there from the wardrobe of the crown.\r\n\r\nWe are informed by M. Hauy that sapphires are found in Bohemia and\r\nFrance, particularly in one part of the Ville du Puy, among the sand of\r\na rivulet near Expailly. In the summer─time, when the rivulet is nearly\r\ndry, they are collected by persons, each of whom is furnished with a\r\nsmall tray and a linen bag. Where─ever there are small depressions in\r\nwhich the water has been stationary, these persons enter them, and fill\r\ntheir trays with the sand. This they wash in water in such manner that\r\nthe lighter particles are carried away; whilst the heavier ones of\r\ngravel, sapphire, and other articles, remain at the bottom.\r\n\r\nSome sapphires exhibit a kind of opalescence, or whitish floating light\r\nin their interior. Sapphires lose all their colour in the fire; and,\r\nafter having been subjected to heat, they are so hard and transparent as\r\nsometimes to be sold for diamonds.\r\n\r\n54. _ORIENTAL RUBY is a precious stone of intense and bright red colour,\r\noccasionally varied with blue, and sometimes party─coloured._\r\n\r\n_In the general form of its crystals it much resembles the sapphire\r\n(53)._\r\n\r\nThe ruby is imported into this country from the East Indies, though\r\nseldom in a rough state, as the stones are almost always first cut by\r\nthe Indians for the purpose of ascertaining their value. They are said\r\nto be found in the sand of certain streams near the town of Sirian, the\r\ncapital of Pegu; and with sapphires in the sand of rivers in Ceylon. But\r\nthey are so seldom seen of large size, that a ruby above thirty─one\r\ncarats’ weight, of perfect colour, and without flaws, is even more\r\nestimable than a diamond of equal weight. The ruby is usually set with a\r\nfoil; but, if peculiarly fine, it is sometimes set without bottom, that\r\nthe stone may be seen through.\r\n\r\nTavernier, the Eastern traveller, states that, in the throne of the\r\nGreat Mogul, he saw 108 rubies, which, on an average, weighed from 100\r\nto 200 carats each. Among the jewels of the King of Candy, that were\r\nsold by auction in London, on the 13th of June, 1820, was a ruby which\r\nmeasured two inches in length, and one inch in breadth. It was, however,\r\ninteresting only as a specimen for a cabinet, for it had, in various\r\ndirections, a great number of small hair─like tubes running through it.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of this stone is such that the ancients do not appear to\r\nhave possessed the art of cutting it; and, in the improvements which of\r\nlate have been made by Mr. Earnshaw in the construction of time─keepers,\r\nno stones have been found sufficiently hard for jewelling the holes,\r\nexcept the ruby and the diamond.\r\n\r\nThere are several modes of counterfeiting rubies; and some persons have\r\nsucceeded so well in imitating these stones, that even the most able\r\nlapidaries, till they try the hardness, may be deceived.\r\n\r\n55. _The ORIENTAL AMETHYST is an extremely rare gem, usually of purple\r\ncolour, apparently formed by an union of the colouring matter of the\r\nsapphire and the ruby_. This stone, if heated, loses its colour, and\r\nbecomes transparent. After this process its brilliancy is such that it\r\nis scarcely distinguishable from the diamond; and, in jeweller’s work,\r\nit is occasionally substituted for that gem. The common amethyst (79),\r\nor that which is chiefly seen, is nothing more than a violet─coloured\r\nrock crystal (78).\r\n\r\n56. _The ORIENTAL TOPAZ and EMERALD are each varieties of the oriental\r\nruby, the former straw─coloured and the latter green_. This kind of\r\nemerald is imported from Pegu, and some other parts of the East Indies,\r\nand is an extremely rare gem.\r\n\r\n57. _The SPINEL and BALAIS RUBY are two kinds of precious stones, which\r\ndiffer from each other principally in colour, the former being of a\r\ncarmine, and the latter a cochineal red._\r\n\r\n_They vary from the oriental ruby (54) in being less hard; in the\r\nprimitive form of their crystals being regular octohedrons (Pl. II, Fig.\r\n5), and in their not being much more than 3 times heavier than water._\r\n\r\nAlthough these two kinds of rubies are inferior, both in lustre and\r\ncolour, to the oriental ruby; yet, when they exceed a certain size, they\r\nare much esteemed. A spinel that weighs more than four carats is valued\r\nat half as much as a diamond of the same weight, and is not unfrequently\r\nimposed upon ignorant purchasers for the oriental species. It is easily\r\nwrought, takes a high polish, and is certainly a beautiful gem. Being\r\ntoo expensive for necklaces, it is usually set in rings and brooches,\r\nsurrounded by brilliants.\r\n\r\nThe spinel ruby is found amongst sand, in one of the rivers of Ceylon,\r\nwhich flows from the high mountains, towards the middle of the island.\r\nIt is also found in Brazil; and in Hungary, Bohemia, and Silesia.\r\n\r\nThe Balais ruby is so named from Balacchan, the Indian appellation of\r\nPegu, from which country it is chiefly imported.\r\n\r\n58. _EMERY is a very hard opaque mineral, of blackish or bluish grey\r\ncolour, which is chiefly found in shapeless masses, and mixed with other\r\nminerals. It is about four times as heavy as water._\r\n\r\nThe best emery is brought from the Levant, and chiefly from Naxos, and\r\nother islands of the Grecian Archipelago, where it occurs abundantly, in\r\nlarge, loose masses, at the foot of primitive mountains. It is also\r\nfound in some parts of Spain; and is obtained from a few of the iron\r\nmines in our own country.\r\n\r\nIn hardness it is nearly equal to adamantine spar; and this property has\r\nrendered it an object of great request in various arts. It is employed\r\nby lapidaries in the cutting and polishing of precious stones; by\r\nopticians, in smoothing the surface of the finer kinds of glass,\r\npreparatory to their being polished; by cutlers, and other manufacturers\r\nof iron and steel instruments; by masons, in the polishing of marble:\r\nand, in their respective businesses, by locksmiths, glaziers, and\r\nnumerous other artisans.\r\n\r\nFor all these purposes it is pulverized in large iron mortars, or in\r\nsteel mills; and is afterwards separated, according to the several\r\ndegrees of fineness that are required, by washing it in water, and\r\nsuffering the grosser particles to deposit themselves. By this operation\r\nthe finer particles, which remain suspended in the water, and which are\r\nobtained by decanting the water off, and suffering it to stand for a\r\nconsiderable time, are separated. The particles first deposited are\r\nagain ground, and again agitated in the water, to separate the finest.\r\nBy these successive operations the emery is reduced to a powder so fine\r\nthat, when rubbed between the fingers, it communicates no sensation\r\nwhatever of grittiness. In general those particles only of the emery\r\nwhich remain suspended in the water, after it has stood about half an\r\nhour, are used to polish metals.\r\n\r\n59. _ADAMANTINE SPAR, or IMPERFECT CORUNDUM, is a very hard and nearly\r\nopaque stone, which varies much in colour, but is chiefly grey, with a\r\ngreenish, brown, or bluish tint._\r\n\r\n_It is usually found in the form of six─sided prisms, but it sometimes\r\noccurs in shapeless masses, has a foliated texture, and is about four\r\ntimes as heavy as water._\r\n\r\nThe name of adamantine spar was given, by the British lapidaries, to\r\nthis substance from its hardness being nearly equal to that of the\r\ndiamond. It was originally discovered among the granite rocks of China;\r\nbut it has since been found, and in greater purity, in Bengal and\r\nCeylon.\r\n\r\nIn a powdered state this substance has long been used by the artists of\r\nIndia and China for the cutting and polishing of precious stones, and\r\neven of the diamond; but, though it will in some degree operate upon\r\nthat gem, it is not sufficiently hard to bring out the peculiar beauty\r\nof it in a degree at all comparable to that which is effected by the\r\nEuropean lapidaries with diamond powder. The Chinese also use adamantine\r\nspar for polishing steel, and in the composition of the finer kinds of\r\nporcelain or earthenware. For the cutting of seals and precious stones\r\nEuropean workmen consider it preferable to emery; but, for minute\r\nengraving, it is much inferior to diamond powder.\r\n\r\n60. _CHRYSOBERYL is a gem of yellowish or brownish green colour, harder\r\nthan quartz (76), and sometimes transparent; but often only\r\nsemi─transparent, in which case it exhibits a bluish light, floating in\r\nthe interior of the stone._\r\n\r\n_It is usually found in rounded pieces, but is sometimes crystallized in\r\ncompressed six─sided prisms, and in double six─sided pyramids._\r\n\r\nSo little is this gem in request in Europe, that it is seldom to be\r\nfound in the possession of jewellers; but in Brazil it is considered\r\ninferior only to the diamond. It is usually procured from South America;\r\nyet it occurs in Saxony; and, with the ruby and sapphire, amongst sand\r\nin the rivers of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nSuch is the hardness of the chrysoberyl, that, when properly polished,\r\nwhich is a difficult operation, it is capable of receiving a lustre\r\nnearly equal to that of the diamond. We are informed that, a few years\r\nago, a considerable number of these gems were imported into this country\r\nfrom Brazil, but that the greater part of them were entirely spoiled by\r\ninferior workmen, and that the rest were so ill─cut that they remained\r\nunnoticed, and without value. The smaller stones are said to appear to\r\nmost advantage in circular ear─drops; and the larger specimens form\r\nnecklaces and ring stones of great beauty.\r\n\r\nThe variety which exhibits an opalescent appearance, or presents a\r\nbluish light, undulating as it were in the interior of the stone, and\r\nchanging its situation according to the position of the observer, is\r\nchiefly valuable as an article of curiosity: the transparent kind is\r\nalways preferred by the jeweller.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SCHORL FAMILY.\r\n\r\n61. _The TOPAZ is a gem usually of a wine─yellow colour, but sometimes\r\norange, pink, blue, and even colourless, like rock_ _crystal; of a\r\nlamellar or foliated structure, harder than quartz, but not so hard as\r\nruby._\r\n\r\n_It varies considerably in its crystallization; is 3½ times heavier than\r\nwater; and, when placed upon any object, shows a double image of it._\r\n\r\nThe name of topaz is derived from an island in the Red Sea, where the\r\nancients found a stone, but very different from ours, which they\r\ndenominated topaz. The best topazes are of a deep colour, and are\r\nimported from Brazil; the most brilliant ones are supposed to be those\r\nof Saxony; but the latter are generally of very pale colour. This\r\nspecies of gem is found in many parts of Europe, but defective in\r\ntransparency, and sometimes even opaque. It occurs in large crystals,\r\nand rolled masses, in an alluvial soil (269), in the upper parts of\r\nAberdeenshire, Scotland; and in veins, along with tin─stone, at St.\r\nAnne’s, in Cornwall. Topazes, more than a pound in weight, have been\r\nfound in Scotland.\r\n\r\nMr. Mawe speaks of a topaz mine at Capon, near Villa Rica, in Brazil. In\r\ntwo breaks or slips of the rocks, he says, there were little soft places\r\nwhere the negroes found the topazes by scraping in them with pieces of\r\niron. He himself observed at least a cart─load of inferior topazes, any\r\nnumber of which he might have taken away; but all that he saw were\r\ndefective and full of flaws.\r\n\r\nThese stones vary much in size; some, particularly those of Siberia,\r\nbeing extremely small, and others being upwards of an inch in thickness.\r\nIn the Collection of Natural History at Paris there is a Brazilian topaz\r\nwhich weighs four ounces and a quarter. These stones are not\r\nsufficiently scarce to be, in general, much valued by the jeweller or\r\nlapidary. The deep yellow variety is preferred to the pale sort,\r\nalthough the latter is often superior to it both in size and hardness.\r\n\r\nFigures have sometimes been engraved on the topaz; and these, when well\r\nexecuted, are of great value. In the National Museum at Paris there is a\r\nsuperb Indian Bacchus engraven on a topaz. The cabinet of the Emperor of\r\nRussia contains several fine topazes of this description.\r\n\r\nSome of the coarse kinds of topaz are broken down, pounded, and used\r\ninstead of emery for the cutting of hard minerals; and powdered topaz\r\nwas formerly kept in apothecaries’ shops, and sold as an antidote\r\nagainst madness.\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat singular circumstance, that, if the Saxon topaz be\r\ngradually exposed to a strong heat in a crucible, it will become white\r\nand, on the contrary, that Brazilian topazes by the same process become\r\nred or pink. By exposure to a still stronger heat, the Brazilian topaz\r\nchanges its colour to a violet─blue.\r\n\r\nJewellers usually divide topazes into the following kinds:\r\n\r\n62. BRAZILIAN and SAXON, already mentioned.\r\n\r\n63. BOHEMIAN.—These are found chiefly in the tin mines of Bohemia, are\r\nof small size, deficient in transparency, have only grey or muddy white\r\ncolours, and are of little value.\r\n\r\n64. BLUE TOPAZ.—This is a large Brazilian gem, which varies in size from\r\none or two carats to two or three ounces. A fine blue topaz, without\r\nflaw, and which weighed an ounce and a quarter, was sold for 200\r\nguineas. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish a blue topaz from an\r\naqua marine (68).\r\n\r\n65. PINK TOPAZ.—Some beautiful rose─coloured varieties of topaz have\r\nbeen brought from Asia Minor, and others are found in South America; but\r\nthe pink topazes in the jewellers’ shops are chiefly stones of the\r\nyellow Brazilian kind, which have had their colour changed by heat.\r\n\r\n66. The WHITE, or NOVA MINA TOPAZ, is a perfectly colourless and\r\ntransparent variety. It generally occurs of small size, and is in\r\nconsiderable estimation in Brazil for ear─rings, or for being set round\r\nyellow topazes. Small stones of this description have recently been\r\nfound at St. Michael’s Mount, in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThere is imported from Brazil a yellow kind of crystal (83), which is so\r\nsimilar, in its appearance, to the yellow topaz as sometimes to be\r\nimposed upon purchasers for that stone.\r\n\r\n67. _The EMERALD is a well─known gem, of pure green colour, and somewhat\r\nharder than quartz._\r\n\r\n_Its natural form is a short six─sided prism; but it is sometimes found\r\nmassive, and rounded like a pebble._\r\n\r\nBy the ancients the emerald was a gem much in request, and particularly\r\nfor engraving upon. They denominated it _smaragdus_, and are said to\r\nhave procured it from Ethiopia and Egypt; but, besides the true emerald,\r\nPliny, under this title, includes green jasper (96), malachite (231),\r\nfluor spar (194), and some other green minerals. The pillars of emerald\r\nin the temple of Hercules at Tyre, mentioned by Herodotus, and the large\r\nemeralds described by Pliny as having been cut into columns and statues,\r\ncannot be referred to the true emerald.\r\n\r\nThe deepest coloured and most valuable emeralds that we are acquainted\r\nwith are brought from Peru. They are found in clefts and veins of\r\ngranite, and other primitive rocks; sometimes grouped with the crystals\r\nof quartz (76), felspar (110), and mica (123); and, not unfrequently,\r\nloose in the sand of rivers. The most ancient emerald mine is that of\r\nManta, in Peru, but it has been some time exhausted; and most of the\r\nemeralds that are now brought to Europe are obtained from a mine\r\nsituated in the valley of Tunca, between the mountains of New Grenada\r\nand Popayan.\r\n\r\nThe emerald is one of the softest of the precious stones; and is almost\r\nexclusively indebted for its value to its charming colour. The brilliant\r\npurple of the ruby, the golden yellow of the topaz, the celestial blue\r\nof the sapphire, are all pleasing tints; but the green of the emerald is\r\nso lovely, that the eye, after glancing over all the others, finds\r\ndelight in resting upon this. In value it is rated next to the ruby;\r\nand, when of good colour, is set without foil and upon a black ground,\r\nlike a brilliant diamond. Emeralds of inferior lustre are generally set\r\nupon a green gold foil. These gems appear to greatest advantage when\r\ntable cut (Pl. II, Fig. 9), and surrounded by brilliants, the lustre of\r\nwhich forms an agreeable contrast with the quiet hue of the emerald.\r\nThey are sometimes formed into pear─shaped ear─drops; but the most\r\nvaluable stones are generally set in rings. A favourite mode of setting\r\nemeralds among the opulent inhabitants of South America is to make them\r\nup into clusters of artificial flowers on gold stems.\r\n\r\nThe largest emerald that has been mentioned is one said to have been\r\npossessed by the inhabitants of the valley of Manta, in Peru, at the\r\ntime when the Spaniards first arrived there. It is recorded to have been\r\nas big as an ostrich’s egg, and to have been worshipped by the\r\nPeruvians, under the name of the Goddess, or Mother of Emeralds. They\r\nbrought smaller ones as offerings to it, which the priests distinguished\r\nby the appellation of daughters. Many fine emeralds are stated to have\r\nformerly been bequeathed to different monasteries on the Continent; but\r\nmost of them are said to have been sold by the monks, and to have had\r\ntheir place supplied by coloured glass imitations. These stones are\r\nseldom seen of large size, and at the same time entirely free from\r\nflaws.\r\n\r\nThe emerald, if heated to a certain degree, assumes a blue colour; but\r\nit recovers its proper tint when cold. When the heat is carried much\r\nbeyond this, it melts into an opaque coloured mass.\r\n\r\nThe precious stone called oriental emerald (56) is a green and very\r\nscarce variety of the oriental ruby.\r\n\r\n68. _The BERYL, or AQUA MARINE, is a light or mountain green variety of\r\nthe emerald, sometimes straw─coloured, bluish, yellow, or even white._\r\n\r\nThese stones are of such frequent occurrence, even in large pieces\r\nperfectly clear and free from flaws, they are in general so soft, and\r\nhave so little the brilliancy of other gems, that they are usually\r\nconsidered of inferior value. The most beautiful kinds are brought from\r\nDauria, on the frontiers of China, from Siberia, and from Brazil. They\r\nare also found in Saxony and the South of France, and are very common at\r\nBaltimore, in North America. Specimens of aqua marine have been obtained\r\nfrom the upper parts of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where they sometimes\r\noccur in alluvial soil, along with rock crystal and topaz. These stones\r\nhave also been found, embedded in granite, near Lough Bray, and\r\nCronebane, in the County of Wicklow, Ireland; and also in mountain rock,\r\nin some parts of Devonshire.\r\n\r\nThey are cut by means of emery (58), and polished with tripoli (119).\r\nThe darkest green specimens are set upon a somewhat steel─coloured foil;\r\nand the pale ones are either placed, like the diamond, on a black\r\nground, or upon a silvery foil. The aqua marine is usually made into\r\nnecklaces; but it is likewise employed for brooches, and not\r\nunfrequently for steel stones and intaglios. The larger ones are in much\r\nesteem among the Turks for the handles of stilettos.\r\n\r\n69. _The TOURMALINE is a stone belonging to the same family as the\r\nemerald, and generally of a smoky blackish colour: sometimes, however,\r\nit is green, red, blue, or brown; and, when not very thick, it is\r\ntransparent._\r\n\r\n_It is occasionally found in shapeless masses, but more frequently\r\ncrystallized in three, six, or nine─sided prisms, variously truncated or\r\nterminated; and its weight is somewhat more than three times that of\r\nwater._\r\n\r\nThis stone was first made known in Europe, about the beginning of the\r\nlast century, by the Dutch merchants, who brought it from the island of\r\nCeylon, where it is principally found. When strongly heated it becomes\r\nelectric; one of the summits of the crystal negatively, and the other\r\npositively. An early writer, by whom it is mentioned, says, that “it has\r\nthe property not only of attracting ashes from the warm or burning\r\ncoals, but that it also repels them again, which is very amusing: for as\r\nsoon as a small quantity of ashes leaps upon it, and appears as if\r\nendeavouring to writhe themselves by force into the stone, they in a\r\nlittle time spring from it again, as if about to make a new attempt. It\r\nwas on this account that the Dutch called it the ashes drawer.”\r\n\r\nSince the above period, tourmaline has been found in Brazil; and in\r\nNorway, Germany, France, and several other parts of Europe. It generally\r\noccurs embedded in different kinds of mountain rock; and, in these, is\r\nrather confined to single beds or strata, than disseminated through the\r\nwhole mass of the mountain. A piece of tourmaline, of cylindrical form,\r\nand brownish grey colour, was some time ago discovered in the\r\nneighbourhood of Kitt─hill, near Callington, Cornwall. Black tourmaline,\r\nboth in large and small crystals, is found in granite rock, in the\r\nvicinity of the Logan, or Rocking─stones, near Treryn, in the same\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nWhen laid on a table, the tourmaline appears a dark and opaque stone;\r\nbut, when held against the light, it has generally a pale brownish hue.\r\nIt is sometimes cut, polished, and worn as a gem; but, on account of the\r\nmuddiness of its colours, it is not in general much esteemed. Those\r\npersons who wear tourmalines set in rings consider them more as objects\r\nof curiosity than of elegance: they show them as small electrical\r\ninstruments, which, after being heated a little while by the fire, will\r\nattract and repel light bodies.\r\n\r\nIn the superb collection of minerals of the British Museum, there is a\r\nmagnificent specimen of _red tourmaline_, or _rubellite_, which has been\r\nvalued at 1000_l._ sterling. It was presented by the King of Ava to the\r\nlate Colonel Symes, when on an embassy to that country, and was\r\nafterwards deposited by the latter in Mr. Greville’s collection; with\r\nthat collection it became the property of the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GARNET FAMILY.\r\n\r\n70. _The PRECIOUS, or NOBLE GARNET, is a gem of crimson colour, which,\r\nwhen crystallized, has the form of a twelve─sided solid (Pl II, Fig. 11,\r\n12). It is sufficiently hard to scratch quartz, and is about four times\r\nas heavy as water._\r\n\r\nThis stone is found abundantly in many mountains (particularly of\r\nprimitive rock), in different parts of the world. But garnets of the\r\nhardest and best quality are brought from Bohemia, where there are\r\nregular mines of them; and a great number of persons are there employed\r\nin collecting, cutting, and boring them. The boring is performed by an\r\ninstrument having a diamond at its extremity, which is rapidly turned by\r\na bow. The work is so expeditiously performed, that an expert artist can\r\nbore 150 garnets, or he can cut and polish thirty, in a day. In Suabia\r\nthere are two towns in which upwards of 140 persons are employed in\r\nthese operations.\r\n\r\nIn general garnets are stones of inferior value. When compared with the\r\nruby, those even of finest quality have a very sombre appearance. The\r\nkinds most esteemed are such as have a clear and intense red colour, or\r\na rich violet or purplish tinge. The best garnets are cut in the manner\r\nof other precious stones, and are usually set upon a foil of the same\r\ncolour. To heighten the colour and transparency of certain garnets,\r\njewellers either form them into what are called doublets, by attaching\r\nto the lower part of the stone a thin plate of silver, or they hollow\r\nthem underneath.\r\n\r\nCrystals of garnet sometimes occur three or four inches in diameter.\r\nThese are cut into small vases; which, if of good colour, and free from\r\ndefects, are highly valued. Many fine engravings have been executed on\r\ngarnet. One of the most beautiful that is known is a figure of the dog\r\nSirius, in the possession of Lord Duncannon.\r\n\r\nThe coarser kinds of garnet are used as emery for the polishing of other\r\nminerals; and are thus prepared. They are made red─hot, then quenched in\r\nwater, reduced to powder in an iron mortar, and lastly diffused through\r\nwater, poured into other vessels, and allowed to settle, in order to\r\nobtain an uniform powder. This powder is known to artists by the name of\r\n_red emery_.\r\n\r\nIt has been conjectured that our garnet was the same kind of stone\r\nwhich, on account of its colour, the ancients denominated _carbuncle_.\r\n\r\n71. COMMON GARNET.—A very inferior variety of garnet, of brown or\r\ngreenish brown colour, is found in our own country, and particularly\r\namongst rocks near Huntley, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. These garnets,\r\nhowever, are, in general, so soft as to be of little value to the\r\nlapidary; and consequently are seldom cut or polished for ornamental\r\npurposes. But being easily fused, and abounding in iron, they are\r\noccasionally employed as a flux in the smelting of rich iron ores: and\r\nas an addition to poor ones.\r\n\r\n72. SYRIAN GARNETS _are distinguished by their violet or purplish\r\ntinge_. Some writers state that they have their name from the word\r\nSoranus, which signifies a red stone; and others from Sirian, a town in\r\nPegu, where they are said to be found in great beauty.\r\n\r\n73. PYROP GARNETS _are of a dark blood─red colour_, which, when the\r\nstones are held between the eye and the light, falls strongly into\r\nyellow: they are chiefly brought from Bohemia: are employed in almost\r\nevery kind of jewellery, and generally set with a gold foil. At\r\nWaldkirch, in Suabia, there are twenty─four mills for the cutting and\r\npolishing of pyrop garnets: and 140 masters are occupied in\r\nmanufacturing these stones.\r\n\r\n74. VESUVIAN _is a liver─brown kind of garnet_, that was originally\r\nfound among rocks ejected from Mount Vesuvius; and in the vicinity of\r\nwhich mountain it still occurs in considerable abundance. At Naples it\r\nis cut into stones for rings and other ornaments. Vesuvian has of late\r\nyears been found in other parts of Europe; and even at Kilranelagh, and\r\nDonegal, in Ireland.\r\n\r\n75. CINNAMON STONE _is a kind of garnet of hyacinth─red colour_, which\r\nis found in angular and roundish pieces among the sand of rivers in the\r\nisland of Ceylon. It is cut as a precious stone; and, when of good\r\ncolour, and free from flaws, is of considerable value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             QUARTZ FAMILY.\r\n\r\n76. _COMMON QUARTZ is a hard and foliated substance, usually of white or\r\ngrey colour, and more or less transparent._\r\n\r\n_It is generally found in shapeless masses, which are nearly thrice as\r\nheavy as water, and the fracture of which is glassy. When crystallized,\r\nit most commonly has the form of a six─sided prism, terminated by a\r\npyramid of six sides._\r\n\r\nThis kind of stone forms a constituent part of many mountains, and is\r\nvery common in our own, as well as in most other countries. It is\r\nsufficiently hard to scratch iron and steel; and it has the property,\r\nafter having been several times successively made red─hot, and dipped\r\ninto water, of communicating to that fluid a certain degree of acidity.\r\n\r\nQuartz is employed, in place of sand, for making the finer kinds of\r\nglass; and also in the manufacture of porcelain. For the latter purpose\r\ngreat quantities are collected from the mountains of Wales, ground into\r\npowder, and in that state shipped to Liverpool, and other parts. After\r\nhaving been burnt and reduced to powder, it is sometimes mixed with\r\nclay, and formed into bricks for the construction of glass furnaces:\r\nthese are capable of resisting the intense heat which is requisite in\r\nthe fusion of glass.\r\n\r\n77. BURRSTONE _is a vesicular and corroded variety of quartz, which\r\nforms a most excellent and valuable_ _kind of millstone_. It is chiefly\r\nfound in France; but is so much esteemed by the English millers, that\r\nthe Society of Arts, in London, for many successive years, offered a\r\nconsiderable reward for its discovery in Great Britain. At length a vein\r\nof burrstone was discovered in the Moel y Golfa hills, North Wales, by a\r\nMr. Evans, who, in consequence received a premium from the Society.\r\nAbout the same time another vein was opened near Conway; and the same\r\nSociety, in 1800, gave a premium of 100_l._ to the widow and orphan\r\nchildren of the discoverer. Both these quarries were sufficiently\r\nconvenient for water carriage; yet the demand for the Cambrian burr did\r\nnot answer the expectation, and millstones of French production were\r\nstill preferred to them.\r\n\r\nThe mode of splitting these stones, as it is practised in some parts of\r\nFrance, is singular, and affords a proof of the extraordinary power of\r\ncapillary attraction. The blocks are first cut into the form of\r\ncylinders, sometimes many feet in height. To split these horizontally\r\ninto millstones, circular indentations are made round them, at proper\r\ndistances, according to the thickness that is to be given to the stones;\r\nwedges of willow, that have been dried in an oven, are then driven into\r\nthe indentations with a mallet. When these have been sunk to a proper\r\ndepth, they are moistened with water; and, after a few hours, the\r\nseveral stones that have been marked out are found to be perfectly\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\n78. _ROCK CRYSTAL is an extremely beautiful kind of quartz, sometimes\r\nperfectly transparent, and sometimes shaded with grey, yellow, green,\r\nbrown, or red. It occurs in the form of crystals with six sides, each\r\nterminated by a six─sided prism._\r\n\r\nThe name of this substance was considered by the ancients to signify\r\nice, or water crystallized; and they imagined that crystal was produced\r\nfrom a congelation of water.\r\n\r\nIts uses are numerous. It is cut into vases, lustres, and snuff─boxes;\r\nand many kinds of toys of extremely beautiful appearance are made of it.\r\nWhen pure and perfectly transparent, it is much in request by opticians,\r\nwho make of it those glasses for spectacles which are called _pebbles_,\r\nand who use it for various kinds of optical instruments. The best\r\ncrystal is imported from Brazil and Madagascar, in blocks, not\r\nunfrequently from fifty to a hundred pounds in weight.\r\n\r\nThis stone is wrought into the different shapes that are required, by\r\nsawing, splitting, and grinding. The sawing is effected by an extended\r\ncopper wire fixed to a bow: the wire is coated with a mixture of oil and\r\nemery, and is drawn backward and forward until the operation is\r\nperformed. But, as this process is a tedious one, particularly when the\r\nmass is large, a more expeditious, although less certain, method is\r\nsometimes adopted. The crystal is heated red hot, and a wet cord is\r\ndrawn across, in the direction that the workman intends to split it. By\r\nthe rapid cooling thus effected, in the direction of the cord, the stone\r\neasily splits by a single blow of the hammer, and generally in the\r\ndirection required. The grinding is performed by means of emery: and the\r\npolishing effected by tin ashes and tripoli.\r\n\r\nThe ancients held vases that were made of this stone in great\r\nestimation, particularly when they were of large size. Of two cups which\r\nthe tyrant Nero broke into pieces in a fit of despair, when informed of\r\nthe revolt that caused his destruction, one was estimated to be worth\r\nmore than 600_l._ of our money. The most valuable kind of crystal that\r\nwas known to the ancients was obtained from the island of Cyprus; but it\r\nwas often faulty in particular parts, having flaws, cracks, and\r\nblemishes. When the crystal was used for the engraving of intaglios and\r\ncameos, the artist could sometimes conceal these defects amongst the\r\nstrokes of his work; but, when it was to be formed into cups or vases,\r\nthis could not be done, and for the latter purpose the purest pieces\r\nonly could be employed.\r\n\r\nIn the counties of Cornwall and Derby, in the neighbourhood of Bristol,\r\nand amongst the mountains of North Wales, small crystals of this kind\r\nare frequently found: these are respectively called _Cornish_, _Buxton_,\r\n_Bristol_, and _Snowdon_ diamonds. We are informed that the crevices of\r\nsome parts of Mont Blanc and the Alps contain rock crystal in such\r\nabundance as to be perfectly bristled with it.\r\n\r\nSome crystals contain in their substance drops of water, or other kind\r\nof fluid; and these, as curiosities, are usually sold at a rate\r\nconsiderably higher than others. There are in the British Museum\r\nspecimens of crystal which enclose many kinds of foreign substances,\r\nsuch as ironstone, needle antimony, and asbestos (136).\r\n\r\nVarious means have been devised for communicating colours to rock\r\ncrystal. If it be heated and plunged into a solution of indigo, or\r\ncopper, it acquires a blue colour; or if into a decoction of cochineal,\r\na red colour. A clove─brown colour may be given by exposing it to the\r\nvapour of burning wood. Artists sometimes communicate beautiful colours\r\nto rock crystals, by forming them into what are called _doublets_. Two\r\nmodes of doing this are adopted. In one, a stone that is brilliant─cut\r\nat the top is hollowed underneath, filled with the colour that the stone\r\nis intended to exhibit, and then closed at the bottom by a plate of\r\nglass. If this kind of doublet be dexterously executed, the deception is\r\nnot easily discovered; for the whole mass will appear of an uniform\r\ntint. The second kind of doublet is formed by cementing a coloured plate\r\nof glass on the base of a rose or brilliant─cut crystal: by this the\r\nwhole stone acquires the colour of the plate.\r\n\r\nThere are found in nature, many coloured kinds of crystal. These are\r\noften confounded with precious stones; and, as such, are made into\r\nfemale ornaments of different kinds. The following are the principal of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n79. COMMON AMETHYST.—_This is a violet─coloured crystal_, which acquires\r\nconsiderable brilliancy in polishing, and is sometimes of sufficient\r\nsize to be formed into columns more than a foot in height, and several\r\ninches in diameter. When the colour is good, and uniformly diffused,\r\namethysts are cut into necklaces, bracelets, ear─rings, and seals; and,\r\nwhen less pure, they are manufactured into snuff─boxes. They are valued\r\nin proportion to the depth of their colour, and to their perfect\r\ntransparency. The most favourite form in which they are made up is in\r\nnecklaces; and as it is not easy to find a number of perfect stones with\r\nprecisely the same tint of colour, necklaces of this description are\r\nvery valuable. The finest that is known was in the possession of her\r\nlate Majesty. When the colour is not uniformly diffused, jewellers\r\nsometimes expose amethysts, for a little while, in a mixture of sand and\r\niron─filings, to a moderate heat; and, by this process, their appearance\r\nis rendered more uniform.\r\n\r\nThe amethyst being almost the only coloured stone that can be worn with\r\nmourning, it derives, from this circumstance, a considerable addition of\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThis species of gem was well known to the ancient Greeks and Romans, and\r\nwas held by them in great esteem. Its name is derived from the Greek\r\nlanguage, and implies a power of preventing intoxication; which\r\n(originating no doubt in the resemblance of its colour to that of wine,\r\nand the absurd doctrine of sympathies) it was believed by the ancients\r\nto possess. They ascribed to it many other virtues, equally surprising\r\nand equally absurd; particularly that the wearing of it would expel\r\nmelancholy, procure the confidence and friendship of princes, render\r\npeople happy, and even dispel storms of wind and hail. The ancients\r\nfrequently engraved upon amethyst; and their favourite subject was the\r\nrepresentation of Bacchus and his followers.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable amethysts are imported into Europe from India and\r\nCeylon. These, although they are with truth denominated oriental, must\r\nbe carefully distinguished from the true oriental amethyst (55), which\r\nis a much more valuable gem. The amethysts next in esteem are found in\r\nBrazil, and are procured in the mining districts of that country.\r\nSiberia, and various countries in Europe, especially Germany and Spain,\r\nalso furnish very beautiful amethysts; and inferior stones of this\r\ndescription are even found in the mountainous districts of some parts\r\nboth of Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\n80. FALSE RUBY _is a crystal of red colour_, and found in Bohemia,\r\nSilesia, and Barbary.\r\n\r\n81. FALSE, _or_ WATER SAPPHIRE _is a blue crystal_, which does not\r\ndiffer much in appearance from the true sapphire, but is considerably\r\nless hard. This kind is found in Bohemia, Silesia, and some parts of\r\nSwitzerland, but it is not so valuable as the last.\r\n\r\n82. FALSE EMERALD _is a green variety of crystal_, the scarcest and most\r\nvaluable of all the coloured kinds. It is chiefly found in Saxony and\r\nDauphiny.\r\n\r\n83. YELLOW, _or_ TOPAZINE CRYSTAL _is a stone of wine─yellow colour_. It\r\nis found in Brazil and Bohemia, but has no other alliance with the true\r\ntopaz than its colour.\r\n\r\n84. CAIRN GORUM CRYSTALS are obtained in various parts of Scotland, but\r\nparticularly from a mountain of that name in the county of Aberdeen.\r\n_They are usually of smoky yellow or brown colour_, and are, at this\r\ntime, so much in request for ornamental articles of dress, that several\r\nlapidaries have been induced to settle in Aberdeen, who are constantly\r\nemployed in cutting them for seals, rings, necklaces, brooches, and\r\nother trinkets. When these crystals are of deep and good colour, they\r\nare nearly as estimable as topazes; and, if clear and large, they are\r\nsold at a high rate. The price of inferior seal─stones varies from ten\r\nshillings to three or four pounds each; but those of superior beauty\r\nwill produce from five to ten guineas. Such specimens as have a pure and\r\nfull yellow colour are often sold for topazes. When they are muddy, the\r\nlapidaries have the art of entirely dissipating the colour, and giving\r\nthem a transparent lustre. This is done by means of heat, which will\r\ndissipate the colour of every species of crystal.\r\n\r\n85. _AVANTURINE is a quartz, generally of reddish colour, sprinkled with\r\nyellowish shining points of mica (123), which are dispersed through its\r\nwhole substance._\r\n\r\nA French artist, some years ago, having by accident, or “par aventure,”\r\nsuffered a quantity of brass filings to fall into a vessel of melted\r\nglass, afterwards found that it was admirably calculated for vases and\r\ndifferent kinds of ornamental work. Hence he denominated it avanturine,\r\na name which mineralogists have since applied to those natural objects\r\nof which this production of art was an apparent imitation.\r\n\r\nAvanturine is found in some of the countries bordering upon the White\r\nSea, in Spain, and some parts of France. In the late Leverian Museum\r\nthere was a piece which weighed near five pounds, and was unique both\r\nfor beauty and magnitude. It had been discovered in 1788, amongst the\r\nruins of the triumphal arch of Julius Cæsar in the valley of Suse, in\r\nPiedmont; and was purchased of the person who found it for 200 guineas.\r\nAvanturine is cut into various ornamental articles, which are sometimes\r\nsold at a very high price.\r\n\r\nImitations of it are very common, and are formed by the simple operation\r\nof throwing brass or copper filings into coloured glass in a state of\r\nfusion.\r\n\r\n86. _CATS─EYE is a stone of brownish grey colour, tinged with green,\r\nyellow, white, or red; semi─transparent, and reflecting from its\r\ninterior a splendid white line or speck, which_ _varies according to the\r\ndirection in which the stone is held to the light._\r\n\r\n_It is found in pieces that are rounded, massive, or blunt─edged._\r\n\r\nThese stones are considered by some writers as varieties of quartz (76),\r\nand by others as a kind of opal (102). They are sometimes found in\r\nHanover, but are chiefly brought from the island of Ceylon. It is usual\r\nto cut them before they are exported, and generally in a convex and\r\noblong form, without facets, and in such manner as to bring the streak\r\nwhich intersects them into the centre. Among the king of Candy’s jewels,\r\nwhich were sold by auction in London, in June 1820, was a cat’s─eye of\r\nextraordinary magnitude and beauty. It was two inches in diameter, of\r\ndark colour, and nearly hemispherical. This stone was set in gold, with\r\nsmall rubies round it, and was sold for more than 400_l._\r\n\r\nCat’s─eyes are chiefly used for setting in rings. Their size seldom\r\nexceeds that of a hazel nut; but there was one in the cabinet of the\r\nDukes of Tuscany, which was nearly an inch in diameter. Those that are\r\nthe most highly esteemed are of an olive─green, or red colour.\r\n\r\n87. _WOODSTONE is a very hard mineral substance, supposed to have been\r\nwood petrified with a siliceous mineral called hornstone._\r\n\r\n_It is of various colours; and has not only the external appearance, but\r\nthe internal organization of wood._\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary mineral is found embedded in sandy loam, in alluvial\r\nsoil (269), and occurs in various parts both of Europe and Asia. It has\r\nbeen found in ferruginous sand, near Woburn, in Bedfordshire, and near\r\nNutfield, in Surrey. Immense pieces of it are discovered in some places\r\nin the original shape of the trees; trunks, branches, and roots. In the\r\nyear 1752 the whole under part of the trunk of a tree, with its branches\r\nand roots, was found, in a state of woodstone, near Chemnitz, in Saxony;\r\nand, in the Electoral Cabinet at Dresden, there is part of the trunk of\r\na tree, from the same place, which measures five feet in length and as\r\nmany in thickness.\r\n\r\nWoodstone is in considerable request by lapidaries. It takes a good\r\npolish, and is made into beads for necklaces, and other female\r\nornaments. In the East Indies it is generally called _Petrified Tamarind\r\nTree_.\r\n\r\n88. _COMMON SAND is a granulated kind of quartz; or consists of rounded\r\ngrains of small size, which have a vitreous or glassy surface._\r\n\r\n_It is usually of white or yellowish colour; but is sometimes blue,\r\nviolet, or black._\r\n\r\nIn the torrid regions of Africa and Asia there are immense tracts of\r\ndesert covered only with sand, so dry and light as to be moveable before\r\nthe wind, and to be formed into vast hills and boundless plains. These\r\nare incessantly changing their place, and frequently overwhelm and\r\ndestroy the travellers whose necessities require them to enter these\r\ndreary realms.\r\n\r\nSand has numerous uses. When mixed in due proportion with lime, it forms\r\nthat hard and valuable cement called mortar. Melted with soda (200) and\r\npotash (205) it is formed into glass; white sand being used for the\r\nfiner kinds, and coarse and more impure sand for bottle glass. A very\r\npure kind of sand which is found in Alum Bay, on the west side of the\r\nIsle of Wight, and on some parts of the coasts of Norfolk, is in great\r\nrequest by glass─makers. Sand is also employed in the manufacture of\r\nearthenware; and its utility in various branches of domestic economy,\r\nbut particularly for the scouring and cleaning of kitchen utensils, is\r\nwell known. In agriculture sand is used by way of manure, to all soils\r\nof clayey lands: as it renders the soil more loose and open than it\r\nwould otherwise be. The best sand for this purpose is that which is\r\nwashed by rains from roads or hills, or that which is taken from the\r\nbeds of rivers.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of sand which is naturally mixed with clay, and has the\r\nname of _Founder’s Sand_, from its being chiefly employed in the\r\nformation of moulds to cast metals in. At Neuilly, in France, there is a\r\nbed of perfectly transparent and crystalline sand. Each grain, when\r\nexamined with a magnifying glass, is seen to consist of a perfect\r\nsix─sided prism, terminated by two six─sided pyramids.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the different kinds of _Sandstone_ will be enumerated in the\r\naccount of the rocks (267, 268).\r\n\r\n89. _LYDIAN STONE is a kind of flinty─slate, of greyish or velvet─black\r\ncolour, not quite so hard as flint, opaque, and about twice and a half\r\nas heavy as water._\r\n\r\n_It is usually massive, and, internally, has a glimmering appearance._\r\n\r\nThis mineral occurs in beds in primitive clay─slate (257); and is found\r\nin Bohemia and Saxony, and also in the Pentland hills near Edinburgh. It\r\nwas first noticed in Lydia, whence it derived its name.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes used as a touchstone to ascertain the purity of gold and\r\nsilver. This was its use among the ancients. The metal to be examined is\r\ndrawn along the stone so as to leave a mark, and its purity is judged by\r\nthe colour of the metallic streak. A good touchstone should be harder\r\nthan the metals, or metallic compounds to be examined; if softer, the\r\npowder of the stone mixes with the trace of the metal and obscures it. A\r\ncertain degree of roughness on the surface of the best stone is also\r\nrequisite, that the metal to be tried may leave a trace or streak\r\nsufficiently distinct. It must not, however, be too rough, otherwise the\r\nparticles of the metal will be hid amongst its inequalities, and no\r\ndistinct trace will be formed. The touchstone should also be of black\r\ncolour, as this tint shows the colour of the streak better than any\r\nother.\r\n\r\n90. _FLINT is a peculiarly hard and compact kind of stone, generally of\r\nsmoke─grey colour, passing into greyish white, reddish, or brown. It is\r\nnearly thrice as heavy as water, and when broken will split, in every\r\ndirection, into pieces which have a smooth surface._\r\n\r\n_It is very common in several parts of England, generally among chalk,\r\narranged in a kind of strata or beds, and in pieces that are for the\r\nmost part either rounded or tubercular._\r\n\r\nThe property which flint possesses of yielding sparks, when struck\r\nagainst steel, has rendered it an article of indispensable utility in\r\nthe system of modern warfare. To this substance the sportsman also is\r\nindebted for a means of obtaining his game. The art of cutting, or\r\nrather of breaking, this stone into gun─flints is of modern date, and\r\nwas for a long time kept secret. The most absurd and contradictory\r\naccounts have been given of it by various writers; and it is only of\r\nlate that the true mode has been rendered public. It consists in\r\nstriking the stone repeatedly with a kind of mallet, and bringing off at\r\neach stroke a splinter which is sharp at one end and thick at the other.\r\nThese splinters are afterwards shaped, by placing them upon a sharp iron\r\ninstrument, and then giving them repeatedly small blows with a mallet.\r\nDuring the whole operation the workman holds the stone in his hand, or\r\nmerely supports it on his knee: and the operation is so simple, that a\r\ngood workman has no difficulty in making 1500 flints in a day. The\r\nmanufacture of gun─flints is chiefly confined to England, and two or\r\nthree departments in France. In Prussia an attempt was once made to\r\nsubstitute a kind of earthenware or porcelain for flint; and such was,\r\nfor some time, used by the Prussian soldiers. All the kinds of flint are\r\nnot equally adapted for guns: the best are the yellowish grey; the dark\r\nsmoke and ash─grey varieties are also used, but they are neither so easy\r\nto be split, nor do they afford such thin fragments as the other; and,\r\nowing to their greater hardness, they wear the lock sooner.\r\n\r\nFlint is employed in the manufacture of porcelain and glass. For this\r\npurpose it is heated red hot, and, in that state, is thrown into cold\r\nwater. It is then of a white colour, and capable, without difficulty, of\r\nbeing reduced to powder, either in a mortar or by a mill. After this\r\npowder has been passed through fine sieves, some aqua fortis is poured\r\nupon it, to dissolve any particles of iron which it may have acquired in\r\nthe grinding. The powder is then several times washed in hot water, and\r\nafterwards dried for use. The glass that is manufactured from this\r\nsubstance is perfectly transparent and faultless.\r\n\r\n_Glass_ is made by mixing sand, or prepared flint, with a certain\r\nproportion of soda (200) or potash (205); and exposing these substances,\r\nin a furnace, to a violent heat. When they are in a perfectly fluid\r\nstate, part of the melted matter is taken out at the end of a long\r\nhollow tube. This is done by dipping the tube into it, and turning it\r\nabout until a sufficient quantity is taken up; the workman, at each\r\nturn, rolling it gently upon a piece of iron, to unite it more\r\nintimately. He then blows through the tube till the melted mass, at the\r\nextremity, swells like a bubble; after which he rolls it again on a\r\nsmooth surface to polish it, and repeats the blowing until the glass is\r\nbrought as nearly to the size and form of the vessel required, as he\r\nthinks necessary.\r\n\r\nIf he be forming a common bottle, the melted matter at the end of the\r\ntube is put into a mould of the exact size and shape of the body of a\r\nbottle; and the neck is formed by drawing out the ductile glass at the\r\nupper extremity.\r\n\r\nIf he be making a vessel with a large or wide orifice, the glass, in its\r\nmelted state, is opened and widened with an iron tool; after which,\r\nbeing again heated, it is whirled about with a circular motion, and, by\r\nthe centrifugal force thus produced, is extended to the size required.\r\nShould a handle, foot, or any thing of similar kind be required, that is\r\nmade separately, and stuck on in its melted state.\r\n\r\n_Window glass_ is made in a similar manner, except that the mass at the\r\nend of a tube is formed into a cylindrical shape. This being cut\r\nlongitudinally by scissars or shears, is gradually bent back until it\r\nbecomes a flat plate.\r\n\r\nLarge _plate glass_ for looking─glasses is made by suffering the mass,\r\nin a state of complete fusion, to flow upon a casting table, with iron\r\nledges. These confine the melted matter, and, as it cools, a metallic\r\nroller is passed over it, to reduce it to an uniform thickness.\r\n\r\nGlass utensils, unless very small and thin, require to be gradually\r\ncooled in an oven. This operation is called _annealing_, and is\r\nnecessary in order to prevent them from cracking by change of\r\ntemperature, wiping, or slight accidental scratches.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the manufacture of glass was known very early; but glass\r\nperfectly transparent was esteemed of extremely high value. It is stated\r\nthat the Emperor Nero purchased two glass cups with handles for a sum\r\nwhich was equivalent to 50,000_l._ of our money. The windows of some of\r\nthe houses of the ancient city of Pompeii, which was buried by an\r\neruption of Mount Vesuvius, in the year 79, were glazed, but the glass\r\nwas thick, and not transparent.\r\n\r\nBy many persons flint is used as a test for ascertaining the purity of\r\nsilver coins. This is done by rubbing them upon the flint; and if the\r\nmark which they leave be not perfectly white, they are rejected as\r\ncounterfeit.\r\n\r\n91. _CALCEDONY is a species of quartz, generally of whitish, bluish, or\r\nsmoke─grey colour; and, when broken, it appears internally dull, and\r\nsomewhat splintery._\r\n\r\n_It is generally found in a massive state, is harder than flint,\r\ngenerally semi─transparent, and 2½ times heavier than water._\r\n\r\nThe name of this stone is derived from Chalcedon, in Upper Asia, whence\r\nit appears to have been originally obtained, and where it is still found\r\nin considerable abundance. Several superb specimens of calcedony have\r\nbeen found in Britain, and particularly in some of the tin and copper\r\nmines of Cornwall. It occurs in several parts of Scotland; and in many\r\nof the countries of the Continent. In the Leverian Museum there was a\r\nspecimen of calcedony, which weighed more than 200 pounds. Its whole\r\nsurface appeared such that, at first sight, one might imagine it to have\r\nformerly been in a liquid state: it had much the appearance that thick\r\noil has while boiling.\r\n\r\nFew stones are susceptible of a higher or more beautiful polish than\r\ncalcedony. Hence the different varieties of it are cut into ring and\r\nseal stones, necklaces, ear─pendants, small vases, cups, and\r\nsnuff─boxes.\r\n\r\n92. _ONYX is a kind of calcedony, generally marked alternately with\r\nstripes of white and black, or white and brown._\r\n\r\nIts name is derived from the Greek language, and has been given on\r\naccount of its resemblance in colour to the whitish band at the base of\r\nthe human nail. The distinction which appears to be made betwixt onyx\r\nand _sardonyx_, arises from the colours of the former being arranged\r\neither concentrically, or in a somewhat confused manner, and those of\r\nthe latter in regular stripes or bands.\r\n\r\nBoth these kinds are highly esteemed by lapidaries, for the formation of\r\nvases, snuff boxes, and trinkets of various kinds. Of sardonyx the\r\nancients made those beautiful cameos, many of which still ornament our\r\ncabinets. The ingenuity they have shown, in the accommodation of the\r\nnatural veins and marks of the stone to the figures engraven upon them,\r\nis such as to excite, in many instances, the greatest admiration.\r\n\r\nIt is said that we are entirely ignorant of the country whence the\r\nancient artists obtained the large specimens of sardonyx which are now\r\nfound in some cabinets.\r\n\r\nOnyx is imported from the East Indies, Siberia, Germany, and Portugal.\r\n\r\n93. _CARNELIAN is another kind of calcedony usually of a red or flesh\r\ncolour, though sometimes white, orange, or yellow._\r\n\r\nOn several of the British shores carnelians are found with other\r\npebbles: but the most beautiful and valuable kinds are imported from the\r\nEast Indies. These are sometimes so large as to measure nearly three\r\ninches in diameter. The kinds principally in request are those of pure\r\nwhite, and bright red colour; and jewellers have the art of changing the\r\ncolour of the yellow varieties to red, by heat.\r\n\r\nNo stone is so much in request for seals as carnelian. It is likewise\r\ncut into beads for necklaces, and stones for ear─rings; into crosses,\r\nbracelets, and other trinkets, which, in India, form a considerable\r\nbranch of traffic. The amount of the sale value of different kinds of\r\ncarnelian goods vended by the East India Company in 1807, was\r\n11,187_l._: but, in other years, it has not usually been so much as half\r\nthat sum.\r\n\r\nFormerly carnelians were exported from Japan to Holland; and thence were\r\ncarried to Oberstein, in France, to be exchanged for the agates of that\r\ncountry, which were exported to China.\r\n\r\nThe carnelian was much esteemed by the ancients; and many fine engraved\r\ncarnelians are preserved in different collections.\r\n\r\n94. _CHRYSOPRASE, an extremely hard kind of stone, of clear and delicate\r\napple─green colour, is considered to be a kind of calcedony._\r\n\r\nThis beautiful mineral has hitherto been found only in the vicinity of\r\nKosemitz, and in a few other parts of Lower Silesia. It is susceptible\r\nof a high polish, and is much prized by jewellers when its colour is\r\ndeep and pure. Its colour, however, is so fugitive, that, if kept in a\r\nwarm and dry situation, it loses the greatest part of it; and if exposed\r\nto moisture it becomes much altered. Lapidaries assert, that great care\r\nought to be taken in the polishing of it;—pretending that if, from want\r\nof sufficient moisture, or by the too rapid motion of the wheel, it be\r\nover─heated, it will become whitish or turbid.\r\n\r\nChrysoprase is generally cut into a convex form, or what jewellers call\r\n_en cabochon_; and is set with green taffeta beneath it, as foil. It is\r\nused for ring stones, brooches, and other ornaments; and is found to\r\nharmonize well with diamonds and pearls. The larger and more impure\r\nmasses are cut into snuff─boxes, seal stones, and similar articles. Some\r\nof the finest specimens of chrysoprase that are known, are to be seen in\r\nthe cathedral church of Prague, where a small closet is inlaid with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nImitations of chrysoprase are sometimes imposed upon the public; but\r\nthese are easily known by persons who are acquainted with the nature of\r\nprecious stones.\r\n\r\n95. _BLOODSTONE, or HELIOTROPE, is an opaque stone of the quartz family,\r\ngenerally of dark green colour, with a somewhat bluish cast, and marked\r\nwith blood─red spots or stripes._\r\n\r\n_It usually occurs in masses of irregular form; and, when cut thin, is\r\nsometimes translucent at the edges._\r\n\r\nThe most valuable kinds of bloodstone are imported from the East. They\r\nare not so opaque as those which are found in Germany, and are marked\r\nwith more vivid spots. As bloodstone is capable of a high polish, and is\r\neven better calculated for engraving upon than carnelian (93), it is in\r\ngreat request for seal stones, for the tops and bottoms of snuff─boxes,\r\nand other articles on which costly gold mountings are frequently\r\nbestowed. Its dark colour and opaque appearance prevent its being much\r\nused for beads. Great quantities of it are consumed in China as\r\nornaments to the girdle clasps of the superior ranks of people. Absurd\r\nas it may appear, many persons entertain a notion that this stone worn\r\nin the dress will prevent bleeding at the nose. Good bloodstone and\r\ncarnelian are considered to be about the same value.\r\n\r\nThere are many cameos and intaglios, both by ancients and moderns,\r\nexecuted in bloodstone. In the National Library at Paris, there is a\r\nfine engraved stone of this kind, representing the head of Christ whilst\r\nundergoing the punishment of scourging, and so cut that the red spots\r\nare made to represent drops of blood.\r\n\r\nThe ancients procured bloodstones chiefly from Ethiopia; but, at\r\npresent, the most highly esteemed varieties are brought from Bucharia,\r\nGreat Tartary, and Siberia. A kind of mineral nearly resembling this is\r\nfound in Rum, one of the western isles of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe spots in bloodstone are particles of red jasper.\r\n\r\n96. _JASPER is a species of quartz, and one of the hardest stones with\r\nwhich we are acquainted. It varies much in colour, being red, green,\r\nyellow, blue, olive, violet, black, and often variegated, spotted, or\r\nveined with several other colours. It is usually opaque, but is capable\r\nof receiving a beautiful polish._\r\n\r\n_This stone is found in large and shapeless masses, and constitutes an\r\ningredient in mountains of various parts of the world._\r\n\r\nSuch is the hardness of jasper, that the savages of Canada avail\r\nthemselves of it for the fabrication of the heads of javelins, and\r\nsometimes also of arrows. It is used by artists for the formation of\r\nvases, snuff─boxes, seals, and trinkets of various kinds; and formerly\r\ncups and saucers were sometimes made of it. Many beautiful antique\r\nengravings have been made upon jasper.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Andalusia, in Spain, there are four fine quarries of\r\njasper. One of these is celebrated for a blood─red stone, streaked with\r\nwhite, exceedingly hard and very handsome, of which the beautiful\r\ncolumns of the tabernacle in the Escurial are made. This quarry is in\r\nthe territory of Cogullus, in the archbishopric of Seville, and was\r\npurchased by the Crown in 1581; but was afterwards so far neglected that\r\neven the place where it lay was not remembered. It was, however, again\r\ndiscovered about the end of the reign of Charles the Third, after a very\r\nexpensive search made by order of the government.\r\n\r\nJasper occurs in the Pentland hills, near Edinburgh, and in several\r\nother parts of Scotland; in the Shetland Islands, and Hebrides. It has\r\nbeen observed in most of the countries of the Continent; and is found,\r\nin great abundance, in Siberia.\r\n\r\n97. RED JASPER _is an opaque red stone which is found embedded in red\r\nclay─ironstone in Baden_; and is cut and polished for various ornamental\r\npurposes. There are extant many fine antique engravings on red jasper.\r\n\r\n98. EGYPTIAN PEBBLE _is a kind of jasper, that is found in globular or\r\nrounded pieces, and is distinguishable when cut or broken, by its\r\nnumerous colours, arranged in concentric stripes or layers_. It is\r\nchiefly brought from Egypt; and, as it is capable of receiving a fine\r\npolish, and when polished is very beautiful, it is manufactured into\r\nseveral kinds of ornamental articles. From the great abundance in which\r\nit is supplied, it is, however, much less valuable than carnelian (93).\r\nThe colours of the Egyptian pebble frequently assume very singular\r\nforms. There was one in the Leverian Museum which exhibited, in the\r\ncentre, the resemblance of a pantaloon, or a man wearing a fool’s cap.\r\n\r\n99. STRIPED, or RIBBON JASPER, _is marked with alternate stripes of\r\ndifferent colours_; and is found in Siberia, Saxony, and even in the\r\nPentland hills, near Edinburgh. It receives an excellent polish, and is\r\nfrequently cut into the tops and bottoms of snuff─boxes. The red and\r\ngreen layers of jasper, being well defined and regular, this kind is\r\nused for several purposes of ornament, particularly for cameos.\r\n\r\n100. _AGATE, or AGATE JASPER, as some mineralogists denominate it, is a\r\nsemi─transparent stone of the quartz family, which is capable of\r\nreceiving a high and very beautiful polish._\r\n\r\n_These stones are always found in a shapeless or massive form, and\r\nnearly of all colours, except bright red and green._\r\n\r\nThe name of agate is derived from the river Achates, in Sicily, in the\r\nvicinity of which these stones were obtained by the ancients in great\r\nabundance. They are now found in several parts of Scotland; in Iceland,\r\nSaxony, and Hungary; and they are occasionally brought into Europe from\r\nChina and the East Indies.\r\n\r\nAgates are used in several kinds of ornamental work, and particularly\r\nfor necklaces and seals. They are occasionally made into cups, the\r\nhandles of knives and forks, hilts of swords and hangers, and the tops\r\nand bottoms of snuff─boxes. The less ornamental kinds are manufactured\r\ninto small mortars, which are employed by enamellers and others, for\r\npounding such substances as are too hard to be reduced in any other way.\r\nThey are also made into instruments for grinding colours, and into\r\npolishers for the glazing of linen. In the Electoral Cabinet at Dresden,\r\nand the Ducal Cabinet in Brunswick, there are several elegant vases\r\nformed of agate.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful agates which our island produces are known by the\r\nname of _Scots Pebbles_. These are found in various parts of Scotland,\r\nbut principally on the sea─shore, in the neighbourhood of Dunbar. _Agate\r\npebbles_ are found on several of the English shores, as those of\r\nSuffolk, Dorset, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland; and sometimes even in\r\ngravel pits. Many of them will bear cutting and polishing as well as the\r\nbest agates of foreign countries.\r\n\r\nAgates are occasionally seen to be figured in very singular manner; but\r\nthis, in some instances at least, is suspected to be the work of art.\r\nOne is mentioned in the church of St. Mark, at Venice, which had the\r\nrepresentation of a king’s head surmounted by a diadem. On another, was\r\nrepresented a man in the attitude of running. But the most remarkable of\r\nall seems to have been one which contained a representation of the nine\r\nMuses, with Apollo in the midst of them!\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked that agate is not, as some mineralogists imagine, a\r\nsimple mineral, but that it is composed of various species of the quartz\r\nfamily, intimately blended together. It consists chiefly of calcedony\r\n(91), with flint, hornstone, carnelian (93), jasper (96), cacholong\r\n(105), amethyst (79), and quartz (76). Of these minerals sometimes only\r\ntwo, and sometimes three or more, occur in the same agate. Its\r\nvarieties, consequently, are extremely numerous.\r\n\r\n101. MOCHOA STONE _is a kind of agate, which has on its surface the\r\nresemblance of moss_; and this so nearly approaching a natural\r\nappearance, that some persons have actually supposed it to be occasioned\r\nby a condensation of moss into stone. Its name is derived from _mocks_,\r\nthe German word for moss.\r\n\r\nThese stones are used for several ornamental purposes; and are not\r\nunfrequently imitated, by spreading a solution of copper in nitric acid\r\nor aqua fortis (30) over the surface of a plain agate, and then setting\r\na small iron nail on its head in the middle. The acid unites with the\r\niron, and deposits the copper in beautiful ramifications from the\r\ncentre. The nail must then be removed, and the surface carefully washed\r\nby dipping the stone into warm water. Afterwards, on the application of\r\na moderate heat, the copper becomes black. As, however, the deposition\r\nis merely superficial, it requires to be covered with glass, to preserve\r\nit from injury.\r\n\r\n102. _OPALS are a semi─transparent kind of stones, which have a milky\r\ncast, and, when held betwixt the eye and the light, exhibit a changeable\r\nappearance of colour._\r\n\r\n_They are always found in a shapeless or massive state, are brittle, and\r\nconsiderably less hard than most other precious stones._\r\n\r\nThe only opal mines in the world are those of Hungary. About four\r\ncenturies ago, opals were obtained, in such abundance, from these mines,\r\nthat upwards of three hundred persons were employed in them. They still\r\nproduce opals, some of which are so valuable as to pass, in commerce,\r\nunder the appellation of _oriental opals_, whilst others are so poor as\r\nto be of no value whatever to the jeweller. Opals are also found in\r\nother parts of Europe; and in the island of Sumatra and several parts of\r\nthe East Indies.\r\n\r\nFew precious stones are more beautiful than opals. Their elegant play of\r\ncolours, brilliant blue, green, red, and yellow, variously modified, has\r\nprocured for them a distinguished rank among gems. Notwithstanding this,\r\nthey are but ill suited to the purposes of jewellery, on account of\r\ntheir softness, their great frangibility, and their sometimes splitting\r\non a sudden change of temperature. They are usually set without bottoms;\r\nbut sometimes with a black bottom, and sometimes with a foil of red,\r\nblue, or gold colour. Their value is such that a fine oriental opal is\r\nconsidered worth about twice as much as an oriental sapphire of the same\r\nsize. By the Turks they are so peculiarly esteemed, that a fine opal of\r\nmoderate size has sometimes been sold at the price of a diamond. The\r\nesteem in which they were held among the ancient Romans was such, that\r\nNonius, the Roman senator, is stated to have preferred banishment to\r\nparting with a favourite opal which Mark Antony was anxious to possess.\r\n\r\nIn the abbey of St. Denys, near Paris, there was formerly a curious\r\nancient opal which was green on the outside, and, when viewed against\r\nthe light, exhibited a fine ruby colour: and in the Imperial Cabinet at\r\nVienna, there are two pieces of opal, from the mines in Hungary, one of\r\nwhich is about five inches long, and 2½ inches broad; and the other the\r\nsize and shape of a hen’s egg. Both these stones exhibit a very rich and\r\nsplendid play of colours.\r\n\r\nIn the purchasing of opals great caution is requisite, as fine glass\r\npastes have not unfrequently been substituted for them, and sold at\r\nenormous prices.\r\n\r\n103. HYDROPHANOUS OPAL, _or_ OCULUS MUNDI, _is a kind of opal, the\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of which is, that it gradually becomes\r\ntransparent, and exhibits a beautiful play of colour after being\r\nimmersed in water_. It is either of a whitish brown, yellowish green,\r\nmilky grey, or yellow colour, and opaque; and, when touched by the\r\ntongue, adheres to it.\r\n\r\nThe name of oculus mundi has been given to these stones from an internal\r\nluminous spot, which changes its position according to the direction in\r\nwhich they are held to the light. The countries in which they are\r\nchiefly found are Hungary and Iceland.\r\n\r\nThey are sometimes set in rings; and the prices at which they were\r\nformerly valued were, in the highest degree, unaccountable and absurd.\r\nAt present their value is considerably lower, though they are still in\r\ngreat request as objects of curiosity. The phenomenon of their becoming\r\ntransparent in water is supposed to be occasioned by that fluid soaking\r\nthrough their whole substance, in the same manner as the transparency of\r\npaper is occasioned by immersing it in oil. An hydrophanous opal\r\nweighing 27½ grains was kept four minutes in water, and, on being taken\r\nout, weighed 32½ grains, having received in this short period an\r\naugmentation of five grains, or more than one sixth part of its whole\r\nweight. When taken from the water, these stones as they dry become again\r\nopaque.\r\n\r\nTo preserve them in beauty and perfection, care should be taken not to\r\nimmerse them in any but pure water, and to take them out as soon as they\r\nhave acquired their full transparency. If these precautions be\r\nneglected, the pores will soon become filled with earthy particles: the\r\nstones will cease to exhibit their peculiar property, and will ever\r\nafterwards continue opaque.\r\n\r\n104. COMMON OPAL _is a semi─transparent kind of opal, which does not\r\nexhibit any changeable refraction of colour_. It is found in Germany,\r\nFrance, Italy, and other countries of the Continent, and is employed for\r\nbrooches and other ornaments. A green─coloured Saxon variety is\r\nsometimes cut into ring─stones.\r\n\r\n105. MOTHER─OF─PEARL OPAL, _or_ CACHOLONG, _is a milk─white, yellowish,\r\nor greyish─white kind of opal_, which occurs in Iceland, Greenland,\r\nSpain, and the island of Elba. It is sometimes cut into a concave form,\r\nfor brooches, and other female ornaments. Italian artists also use it\r\nfor mosaic work.\r\n\r\n106. WOOD OPAL _appears to be wood that, by some extraordinary operation\r\nof nature, has been converted into opal_. Some specimens exhibit, very\r\nbeautifully, the ligneous texture. This kind of opal is chiefly cut into\r\nplates for the tops and bottoms of snuff─boxes. It is found in alluvial\r\nland in some parts of Germany and Hungary. Several years ago the trunk\r\nof a tree, penetrated with opal, and so heavy that eight oxen were\r\nrequisite to draw it, was found in Hungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PITCHSTONE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n107. _OBSIDIAN is a kind of glass, generally of blackish colour, formed\r\nin volcanoes, from which it issues in thick streams._\r\n\r\nThis substance has been used for various purposes. It is possible to cut\r\nand polish it; but its brittleness and frangibility are so great, that,\r\nwithout much care, it will fly into pieces during the working. The\r\nreflectors of telescopes are sometimes formed of it. In Mexico and Peru\r\nobsidian is cut into mirrors; and the inhabitants of those countries\r\nused formerly to manufacture it into knives and other cutting\r\ninstruments. Hernandez says that he saw more than a hundred of these\r\nknives made in an hour. Cortez, in a letter to the Emperor Charles the\r\nFifth, relates that he saw razors that had been formed of obsidian. The\r\nnatives of Easter and Ascension Islands use this substance for cutting\r\ninstruments; and also for pointing their lances and spears, and, in\r\nplace of flint, for striking fire with. According to the account that\r\nhas been given by Pliny, the ancients sometimes formed obsidian into\r\nmirrors, and ornamental articles of different kinds. The Danish\r\nlapidaries, who obtain considerable quantities of it from Iceland, cut\r\nit into snuff─boxes, ring─stones, and ear─pendants.\r\n\r\nObsidian is found near Mount Hecla, and in other parts of Iceland. Sir\r\nGeorge Mackenzie, during his journey through that island, observed an\r\nimmense mass of this substance, which appeared to him to have been part\r\nof a stream that had flowed from a volcano. It is also found in Sicily,\r\nand several other islands of the Mediterranean; and in nearly all parts\r\nof the world where there are volcanoes.\r\n\r\n108. _PUMICE is an extremely light and porous mineral, of somewhat\r\nfibrous texture, and of white, grey, reddish, brown, or black colour._\r\n\r\nFrom the texture of this mineral, which is chiefly brought from the\r\nneighbourhood of volcanoes, some persons have imagined it to be asbestos\r\ndecomposed by the action of fire. Its lightness is such that, placed in\r\nwater, it will float.\r\n\r\nTo mechanics and other artists pumice stone is a very useful mineral. It\r\nis employed for cleansing and smoothing the surface of wood, leather,\r\nmetal, stones, glass, and other substances; and it is used by\r\nparchment─makers, curriers, and hat─makers. Hence it forms a\r\nconsiderable article of trade: and is exported from the Lipari Islands,\r\nin great quantities, to the different countries of Europe. Sailors in\r\nthe Mediterranean rub their beards off with pumice, instead of shaving.\r\nOn account of its porosity, it is used in Teneriffe as a filtering\r\nstone. It forms a pernicious ingredient in some kinds of tooth powder;\r\nand in Italy is ground and used instead of sand, in the making of\r\nmortar. Pumice occurs in Ireland, along with obsidian (107); and it\r\nabounds in several islands of the Grecian Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AZURE STONE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n109. _LAPIS LAZULI, AZURE STONE, or LAZULITE, is a mineral of azure─blue\r\ncolour in various shades, and generally accompanied with white or\r\nclouded spots, and also with pyrites (236), which have the appearance of\r\ngolden veins or spots. Its texture is earthy, and fracture uneven. It is\r\nopaque, or nearly so, and, in some parts, is sufficiently hard to strike\r\nfire with steel. We are not informed that lapis lazuli is otherwise\r\nfound than in shapeless masses or lumps._\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years ago this stone was an article much in fashion for\r\nvarious ornamental parts of dress. Being capable of very high polish, it\r\nwas cut into beads, stones for rings, bracelets, and necklaces. It was\r\nalso cut into ornamental vases, small statues, and the tops and bottoms\r\nof snuff─boxes; but of late it has been almost wholly out of use for\r\nthese purposes. Before the French Revolution it was imported, to\r\nconsiderable extent, into that country from the Persian Gulf for the\r\ninlaying of richly─decorated altars; and its value was appreciated\r\naccording to the proportion of its yellow spots or veins: these, by many\r\npersons, were erroneously considered to be of gold.\r\n\r\nThe most important purpose to which lapis lazuli is now applied is in\r\nthe manufacturing of the beautiful and brilliant blue colour so much\r\nesteemed by painters, called _ultramarine_. For the making of this, such\r\npieces are selected as contain the greatest proportion of blue\r\nsubstance, and consequently the least yellow or white. These are burned\r\nor calcined, reduced to a fine powder, made into a paste with wax,\r\nlinseed oil, and resinous matters of different kinds, and afterwards\r\nseparated by washing. The powder that is left in this operation, which\r\nrequires much time and great attention to perform, is ultramarine.\r\n\r\nThere are few colours so little susceptible of change from the effects\r\nof time as ultramarine: the consequence of this has been that, as\r\nseveral of the ancient painters introduced it for the representation of\r\nblue drapery, their pictures, in many instances, are now devoid of\r\nharmony, as this colour alone has stood, whilst all the others have\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nLapis lazuli is principally brought from Persia, Natolia, and China; but\r\nit is also found in Siberia and Tartary. In Europe it has been\r\ndiscovered only in Germany, and among the ruins of Rome.\r\n\r\nA coarse imitation of it is sometimes made by throwing copper filings\r\ninto blue enamel whilst in a melted state.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FELSPAR FAMILY.\r\n\r\n110. _COMMON FELSPAR is a hard kind of stone which varies much in\r\ncolour, being flesh─red, bluish grey, yellowish white, milk─white, or\r\nbrownish yellow._\r\n\r\n_It is found in a massive state, disseminated or crystallized in four,\r\nsix, and ten─sided prisms; will strike fire with steel, and is sometimes\r\nopaque and coloured, sometimes transparent and whitish._\r\n\r\nThe name of felspar is derived from the German language, and signifies\r\n_spar of the fields_. It is a very common substance, and constitutes a\r\nprincipal part of many of the highest mountains of the world. When\r\nexposed to weather, it gradually acquires an earthy appearance, and at\r\nlength passes into porcelain clay (118).\r\n\r\nFelspar is of great use in the manufacture of the finer kinds of\r\nearthenware. Of the two substances which chiefly compose the porcelain\r\nof China, one called _petunzé_ is a whitish laminar kind of felspar.\r\nThis mineral is used in the celebrated porcelain that is manufactured at\r\nSevres, near Paris, for the purpose of giving to it a white and\r\ntransparent appearance. Previously to being used, it is pulverized, made\r\ninto a paste, and suffered to dry. It is sometimes applied to the\r\nsurface of ornamental vases in the form of enamel.\r\n\r\n111. AMAZON STONE _is a green variety of felspar_, which is found in\r\nsmall rolled pieces on the bank of the river of Amazons, in South\r\nAmerica, whence it has its name. It is susceptible of a beautiful\r\npolish, and is often cut into ring─stones, brooches, and the tops of\r\nsnuff─boxes. Lapidaries consider it to be most estimable when\r\naccompanied by mica, which gives it a kind of speckled perlaceous\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n112. _LABRADOR FELSPAR is a very beautiful stone, of smoky grey colour,\r\nintermingled with veins and shades of blue, green, and golden yellow,\r\nexhibiting a brilliant play of_ _colours, according to the position with\r\nrespect to the light in which it is held._\r\n\r\nThe original discovery of this singular mineral was by the Moravian\r\nmissionaries, on the island of St. Paul, near the coast of Labrador; but\r\nit has since been found in various parts of Norway and Siberia. Persons\r\nwho have passed in boats along the rivers of Labrador, have described\r\nthe extremely brilliant and beautiful appearance which the rocks of this\r\nsubstance frequently exhibit in shallow places, at the bottom of the\r\nwater. The visitors of the late Leverian Museum will, no doubt,\r\nrecollect a remarkably fine mass of Labrador felspar, the surface of\r\nwhich was polished, and exhibited some of the most splendid and\r\nbeautiful colours that can be imagined. It was considered to have been\r\nthe most capital specimen that was ever brought to England.\r\n\r\nThis mineral, on account of its hardness, its brilliancy, and its\r\ncapability of receiving a high polish, is in considerable estimation\r\namong lapidaries for different kinds of ornamental work, particularly\r\nfor the tops and bottoms of snuff─boxes, for brooches, and necklaces.\r\n\r\n113. _MOONSTONE, or ADULARIA, is the purest kind of felspar that is\r\nknown; and is considered to have the same relation to common felspar\r\nthat rock crystal has to common quartz. Its colour is white, sometimes\r\nwith a shade of yellow, red, or green._\r\n\r\nThe translucent varieties of this stone, when viewed in a certain\r\ndirection, sometimes exhibit a pearly and silvery play of colour. These\r\nare valued by jewellers, who cut them into a semi─globular form, and\r\nsell them under the name of moonstone. Those specimens are considered\r\nmost estimable which, when cut in a very low oval, present the silvery\r\nspot in the centre of the stone. They are generally used for rings and\r\nbrooches; and when set round with diamonds, their pearly lustre exhibits\r\na striking and agreeable contrast with the brilliancy of that gem.\r\n\r\nAdularia is said to have been first discovered by an Italian\r\nmineralogist, near Mount St. Gothard, in Switzerland. He named it\r\nAdularia felspar, in the belief that the mountain on which he had found\r\nit was named Adula. This, however, was not the case; for Mount Adula is\r\nat some distance from St. Gothard, in the Grisons. This mineral has\r\nsince been found in the granite of the island of Arran, in France, and\r\nGermany. The finest specimens are brought from Ceylon.\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ORDER II.–SOFT STONES.\r\n\r\n                 (Those which will not scratch Glass.)\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n                              CLAY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n114. Clay is a mixture of alumine (33) and silex (38), and is too well\r\nknown to require much description.\r\n\r\nIt is opaque, has an earthy texture, is about twice as heavy as water,\r\nwhen moistened is very ductile, adheres slightly to the tongue; and with\r\nits peculiar smell (called clayey) every one is acquainted.\r\n\r\n115. _COMMON CLAY, or POTTER’s CLAY, which is found in nearly every\r\ncountry of the world, is sometimes white, has a blue or yellowish tinge,\r\nor is brown or reddish._\r\n\r\nIt is the peculiar quality of this substance to become so hard by heat\r\nthat it will even strike fire with steel. The ductility of clay, and its\r\nproperty of thus hardening in the fire, have rendered it an article of\r\nindispensable utility to mankind in all civilized countries. It is\r\nformed into eating vessels of almost every description; plates, dishes,\r\ncups, basins, bowls, and pans for keeping provisions in. For these\r\nalmost any kind of clay may be advantageously used; but it is necessary\r\nto mix it with sand, for the purpose of rendering the vessels that are\r\nmade of it more firm and strong. Those that are applied to culinary, and\r\nother uses in which it is requisite for them not to be penetrable by\r\nwater, are covered with a glazing. This glazing, for coarse ware, is\r\nsometimes made with lead, and sometimes by throwing a certain portion of\r\nsalt into the furnace. In the formation of the better kinds of\r\nearthenware, the clay is made into a paste with water, moulded into the\r\nrequisite shape upon an horizontal wheel, the inside being formed by one\r\nhand of the potter, and the outside by the other, as the wheel turns\r\nround. When the pieces have been baked, they are dipped into a glazing\r\nmixture, consisting of white lead, ground flints, and water, and are\r\nexposed a second time to the fire. The different colours of earthenware\r\nare obtained by means of various kinds of metallic oxides (21).\r\n\r\nThe coarser kinds of clay are manufactured into _bricks_ for the\r\nbuilding of houses, and _tiles_ for the covering and paving of them.\r\nThese are formed in moulds of the requisite shape, afterwards dried for\r\nsome time in the sun, and finally piled in kilns, and there baked to a\r\nproper degree of hardness. The earth for bricks ought to be sufficiently\r\nfine, free from pebbles, and not too sandy, which would render them\r\nheavy and brittle; nor ought it to be entirely free from sand, as this\r\nwould make them crack in drying.\r\n\r\nClay is a substance of inestimable value for forming the bottoms of\r\nponds, and the bottoms and sides of canals and reservoirs, to prevent\r\nthe water from draining away. It also composes, in a great measure,\r\nthose tenacious earths called arable soils. What is peculiarly\r\ndenominated clay land is known by its holding water, and not soon drying\r\nwhen wetted. Such land requires much labour from the husbandman, before\r\nit can be sufficiently pulverized, or brought to a fit state for being\r\nproductive of corn or grass.\r\n\r\n116. PIPE CLAY _is a fine and yellowish white variety of common clay_.\r\nIt is very plastic, adheres strongly to the tongue; and, in a strong\r\nheat, is hardened, and rendered perfectly white.\r\n\r\nIt is of this clay that tobacco pipes are made, by the simple process of\r\ncasting them in moulds, forming a hole through the stems by means of a\r\nwire, generally dipping the small end into some glazing material, and\r\nthen baking them. Pipe clay is also formed into oblong pieces, dried,\r\nand employed for cleaning white woollen cloths, and for various purposes\r\nof domestic utility. It is likewise the basis of the yellow, of what is\r\ncalled _Queen’s ware_ pottery. This is glazed in a manner somewhat\r\ndifferent from that of common pottery. The glazing mixture consists of a\r\ncertain proportion of carbonat of lead (239), ground flint, and flint\r\nglass, worked with water to the thickness of cream. The ware, before it\r\nis glazed, is baked, and thus acquires the property of strongly imbibing\r\nmoisture. It is then dipped into the above composition; exposed a second\r\ntime to the fire, by which the glaze it has imbibed is melted. A thin\r\nglossy coat is thus formed upon its surface, which is more or less\r\nyellow, according to the greater or less proportion of lead that has\r\nbeen used.\r\n\r\n117. _LOAM is a yellowish or brownish kind of clay; sometimes containing\r\na considerable proportion of sand. It occurs in immense beds, and is\r\nfound in almost every part of the world._\r\n\r\nThis substance, when mixed with straw or hair, to prevent it from\r\ncracking, is extensively used for the building of what are called mud\r\ncottages or houses. These are generally reared on a foundation of stone,\r\nor brickwork, to secure them from injury by the moisture of the earth.\r\nIt is said to be the most advantageous practice to form the loam into\r\nbricks, and to dry these in the shade, and afterwards in the sun. The\r\nuse of such bricks is of great antiquity. We are informed that the\r\nancient city of Damascus, and even the walls of Babylon, were\r\nconstructed of bricks made of loam.\r\n\r\n118. _PORCELAIN CLAY is generally of white or reddish white colour,\r\nsometimes inclining to yellowish or grey. When dry, it absorbs moisture\r\nrapidly; and it becomes very tenacious when kneaded._\r\n\r\n_It is known from the other clays by the fineness of its particles, its\r\nsoiling the fingers much when handled, and its fine but meagre feel._\r\n\r\nThe usual distinction betwixt earthen ware and porcelain is, that the\r\nformer is opaque, and the latter semi─transparent. In the manufacture of\r\nporcelain the clay is sometimes used alone, and sometimes intermixed\r\nwith other earths, or with felspar (110). The earliest manufacture of\r\nporcelain is supposed to have been that in China and Japan. The quantity\r\nproduced in China must formerly have been extremely great; as not only a\r\nconsiderable portion of the eastern parts of the world, but almost the\r\nwhole of Europe, was supplied with it. In a single province it is said\r\nthat nearly a million of persons were at one time employed in this\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nThe manufactory at Sevres, in France, has long been celebrated both for\r\nthe excellence and elegance of its porcelain. There are well─known\r\nmanufactories of porcelain at Meissen in Saxony, at Berlin, and in\r\nAustria; but none of these are at present superior to our own, in\r\nWorcestershire and Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nPorcelain clay occurs chiefly in countries which abound with granite\r\n(251) and gneiss (255). It is found in small quantity in Cornwall, and\r\nother granite districts of England, as well as in those of Scotland and\r\nIreland. But the most valuable kinds of this clay are found in China and\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nThe mineral is not used in the state in which it is found in the earth;\r\nbut is previously washed several times to free it from impurities. After\r\nthe process of washing, only about fifteen parts of pure clay remain:\r\nthis is the _kaolin_ of the Chinese. To form the composition of the\r\nporcelain, this clay is mixed, in certain proportions, with quartz (76),\r\nflint, gypsum (192), steatite (124), or other substances; and the\r\nmixture is sifted several times through hair sieves. It is afterwards\r\nmoistened with rain water, and, in the form of a paste, is put into\r\ncovered casks. Here a fermentation soon takes place, which changes its\r\nsmell, colour, and consistence. Its colour passes from white into dark\r\ngrey; and the matter becomes both tougher and more soft than before. The\r\npeculiar mode of preparing this mixture, and the art of rightly managing\r\nit, are secrets in most porcelain manufactories.\r\n\r\nThe next operation consists in giving to the paste thus formed the\r\nrequisite shape of the vessels. This is done first by kneading it with\r\nthe hands; and then by taking up certain portions of it, and turning it\r\non a lathe, in the manner of common pottery (115), but with more care.\r\n\r\nThe third operation is the baking or firing. This is done in furnaces of\r\na particular construction, and generally lasts from thirty─six to\r\nforty─eight hours. The state of the baking is shown by proof pieces, as\r\nthey are called, which are placed in convenient situations, and can be\r\ndrawn out, from time to time, for examination. The porcelain in this\r\nstate, is named _biscuit porcelain_; and figures, and such other\r\nporcelain articles as are neither to be painted nor exposed to water are\r\nin the state of biscuit.\r\n\r\nA fourth operation is covering the surface of the biscuit with a varnish\r\nor enamel. This is composed of pure white quartz (76), white porcelain,\r\nand calcined crystals of gypsum (192); and sometimes principally of\r\nfelspar (110). These substances are carefully ground, then diffused\r\nthrough water, and formed into a paste. When used, the paste is diluted\r\nin water, so as to give it considerable fluidity; and the pieces of\r\nbiscuit porcelain are separately plunged into it, in such manner as to\r\ncover their whole surface. These are then exposed to a heat sufficient\r\nto melt the enamel or covering: and in this state they constitute white\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nIf the porcelain is to be painted, it must again be exposed to heat in\r\nthe furnace. The colours used for the painting of it are all derived\r\nfrom metals; and many of them, though dull when applied, acquire\r\nconsiderable lustre by the action of the fire. The colours are always\r\nmixed with some kind of flux, such as a mixture of glass (204), borax\r\n(208), and nitre, melted together, and afterwards ground.\r\n\r\nGum or oil of lavender is used for mixing up the colours. When the\r\npainting is finished, the pieces are exposed to a heat sufficient to\r\nmelt the flux, and thus fix the colour.\r\n\r\n119. _TRIPOLI is a kind of clay of yellowish grey, brown, or white\r\ncolour, sometimes striped or spotted, and of an earthy texture._\r\n\r\n_It feels harsh and dry to the touch; is soft, scarcely adheres to the\r\ntongue, and will not take a polish from the nail._\r\n\r\nThis substance obtained its name from having formerly been imported into\r\nEurope from Tripoli, on the north coast of Africa. It is, however, now\r\nfound in several parts of Germany; and a granulated kind has been\r\ndiscovered in England.\r\n\r\nTripoli is used for the polishing of metals and stones. For this\r\npurpose, it is mixed with sulphur, in the proportion of two parts of\r\ntripoli to one of sulphur. These are well rubbed together on a marble\r\nslab, and are applied to the stone or metal with a piece of leather.\r\n\r\nWhen tripoli is combined with red ironstone, it is used for the\r\npolishing of optical glasses. It is sometimes made into moulds, in which\r\nsmall metallic or glass figures and, medallions are cast; and a kind of\r\ntripoli is found near Burgos, in Spain, which is used as an ingredient\r\nin the manufacture of porcelain.\r\n\r\nIn Derbyshire,, and several parts of Staffordshire, is dug a kind of\r\ntripoli which has the name of _rotten stone_. This is considered to be a\r\nproduce of limestone shale, which has undergone a decomposition by\r\nexposure to the air and moisture. It is used for most of the same\r\npurposes as tripoli.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CLAY SLATE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n120. _CLAY SLATE, or ROOFING SLATE, is a kind of stone of foliated\r\ntexture, and greyish, black, brown, green, or bluish colour._\r\n\r\n_It breaks into splinters, does not adhere to the tongue, yields\r\ngenerally a clear sound when struck, and is nearly thrice as heavy as\r\nwater._\r\n\r\nVast and extensive beds of slate occur in different parts of the world;\r\nand this mineral sometimes constitutes even a principal portion of\r\nmountains. In our own country there are many important quarries of it,\r\nparticularly in Westmoreland, Yorkshire, Wales, and Derbyshire.\r\n\r\nThe uses of slate are numerous and important; but its principal use is\r\nfor the roofing of houses. For this purpose it is split into thin plates\r\nor laminæ. These are fastened to the rafters by pegs driven through\r\nthem; and are made to lap over each other at the edges, in such manner\r\nas to exclude the rain and other moisture. The kinds which are preferred\r\nfor this purpose are such as have the smoothest surface, and split into\r\nthe thinnest plates. It is requisite that slates should be damp when\r\nthey are split, otherwise this cannot be done without difficulty. Hence\r\nit is generally customary to split the masses as soon as possible after\r\nthey have been separated from the rock.\r\n\r\nSlate should not be porous. If it be so, rain and snow water will pass\r\nthrough it, and destroy the wood─work of the house on which it is\r\nplaced. Porous slate is also liable to have moss and lichens grow upon\r\nand cover it. These plants retain moisture long, and keep the surface,\r\nand even the interior of the slate, moist; so that, during the winter\r\nseason, by the freezing of the moisture, the slate is apt to split and\r\nfall into pieces. To ascertain whether the slate be of requisite\r\ncompactness, it should be completely dried, then weighed, and afterwards\r\nsoaked for some time in water. When taken out it is to be wiped with a\r\ncloth, and again weighed. If it have not acquired any considerable\r\nincrease of weight, it is a proof of its being sufficiently compact. If,\r\non the contrary, it have absorbed much of the water, and have become\r\nconsiderably heavier by the immersion, it is shown to be of a porous\r\ntexture. Slates that are brittle are bad. If they emit a tolerably clear\r\nsound, when struck with a hammer, it is considered a proof that they are\r\nnot too brittle: if, on the contrary, the sound be dull, they are soft\r\nand shattery. A good slate ought also to resist the action of a\r\nconsiderable degree of heat.\r\n\r\nThe slates that are principally used in London are brought from North\r\nWales, from quarries that are worked near Bangor. There are also\r\nextensive slate quarries near Kendal, in Westmoreland; and the Kendal\r\nslates, which are of a bluish green colour, are more highly esteemed\r\nthan those from Wales. They are not of large size, but they possess\r\ngreat durability, and give a peculiarly neat appearance to the roofs on\r\nwhich they are placed. The slate quarries near Easdale, in Scotland, are\r\nso extensive as to furnish annually more than 5,000,000 in number, and\r\nto give employment to upwards of 300 men.\r\n\r\n_French slates_ were much used in London about seventy years ago; but\r\nthey have been found too small, thin, and light, to resist the winds and\r\nstorms of this changeable climate.\r\n\r\nDark─coloured, compact, and solid slates are manufactured into _writing\r\nslates_, or _table slates_, as they are sometimes called. In the\r\npreparation of these, the slate, after it is split of proper thickness,\r\nis smoothed with an iron instrument. It is then ground with sandstone,\r\nand slightly polished with tripoli (119), and, lastly, rubbed with\r\ncharcoal powder. It is cut into the requisite shape, set in a wooden\r\nframe, and is then ready for use.\r\n\r\nFor writing on these slates, pencils are used which are also made of\r\nslate. These, which are called _slate pencils_, are made of a particular\r\nkind of slate, that, on splitting, falls into long splintery fragments.\r\nIt is necessary that the pencils should be considerably softer than the\r\nslate to be written upon, so that they may leave a whitish streak on its\r\nsurface, without scratching it. Such is the shivery nature of the slate\r\nof which they are made, that, if it be exposed for some time to the\r\naction of the sun or frost, it is rendered useless. Hence, workmen are\r\ncareful to cover it up and sprinkle it with water, as soon as it is\r\ntaken from the quarry, and to preserve it in damp cellars. The pieces\r\nare afterwards split by a particular instrument, and then wrought into\r\nthe requisite shape.\r\n\r\nIn some of the quarries in Derbyshire and Wales the slate is so thick as\r\nto admit of being split into large and tabular pieces. These are used\r\nfor gravestones, and for slabs for dairies and cellars. Paving stones\r\nand mile─stones are also formed of them; and vessels for the salting of\r\nmeat, and setting of milk in dairies. For the latter use slate is\r\npeculiarly well adapted, on account of its resistance of greasy or oily\r\nsubstances. But this property renders it unfit for any purpose for which\r\nit is requisite to be painted; as, the oil not entering the stone, the\r\npaint soon peels off, and leaves the stone as black as it was at first.\r\nCut into narrow strips, slate has also been applied, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Bangor, North Wales, for the formation of fences.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficiently solid for the purpose, slate is cut into inkstands,\r\nand turned into vases, and fancy articles of various kinds. And a\r\nsingular circumstance has been remarked, that, if a window or door be\r\nsuddenly opened, in an apartment where the workmen are turning these,\r\nthey will sometimes fly in pieces; though, after the work is finished,\r\nthey may be exposed to the usual changes of temperature without injury.\r\n\r\nPounded slate is advantageously used for cleaning iron and other works\r\nin metal. When well ground, and mixed with a certain proportion of loam,\r\nslate is made into moulds for the casting of metals in; and, when burned\r\nand coarsely ground, is used instead of sand in the making of a solid\r\nand impermeable mortar or cement, for the parts of buildings that are\r\ncovered with water.\r\n\r\n121. _BLACK CHALK, or DRAWING SLATE, is an earthy substance, of slaty\r\ntexture; generally of a greyish, sometimes a bluish black colour._\r\n\r\n_It is soft and smooth to the touch, and, in handling, stains the\r\nfingers._\r\n\r\nTo crayon painters, and other artists, black chalk is a very useful\r\narticle. Considerable quantities of it are imported from France, Spain,\r\nand Italy. The best is brought from Italy. This is more free from gritty\r\nparticles, more firm and compact in its texture, and in its touch much\r\nsmoother than the chalk of any other country. It contains somewhat more\r\nthan one─tenth part of its weight of charcoal. When prepared for use, it\r\nis cut into square pieces, which are sometimes enclosed in wooden cases,\r\nlike black lead pencils. These pencils are said to become dry, hard, and\r\nunfit for use, by long keeping. To preserve them in greatest perfection,\r\nthey should be kept in a moist place. Some artists prefer pencils that\r\nare made of the chalk finely ground, mixed with a certain proportion of\r\ngum water, and cast in moulds. Care should be taken not to put too much\r\ngum, as the pencils will not, in such case, leave any mark on the paper.\r\n\r\nDrawing slate is sometimes used as a black colour for painting. For this\r\npurpose it is pounded or ground, and then mixed with oil or size,\r\naccording to the kind of work for which it is required. When black chalk\r\nis strongly heated, it loses its colour, and assumes that of a reddish\r\ngrey.\r\n\r\n122. _HONE, or WHET SLATE, is a well─known kind of stone, of somewhat\r\nslaty texture, and generally of dull white, or greenish grey colour. Its\r\nsurface is smooth, and feels unctuous to the touch._\r\n\r\nThese stones, when properly cut and smoothed, are of indispensable\r\nutility to carpenters, cutlers, and others, for sharpening their cutting\r\ninstruments upon. Those of the finest grain are used for lancets,\r\npenknives, and razors. For this purpose their surface, when used, is\r\ncovered with a small quantity of oil; by which, after a while, they are\r\nrendered considerably harder than they were at first. They ought to be\r\nkept in damp and cool places; for, if much exposed to the sun, they\r\nbecome too hard and dry for many purposes to which they are applied.\r\n\r\nThere is a vulgar and erroneous notion that hones are holly wood, which\r\nby lying in petrifying water, have been thereby converted into stone.\r\nThe greater number of them have a fine and a coarse side. From the\r\ncircumstance of their having been originally brought into this country\r\nfrom Turkey and the Levant, they are sometimes called _Turkey stones_.\r\nThey are now found in Saxony and Bohemia, in North Wales, and near\r\nDrogheda, in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe powder of whet slate is sometimes used, instead of emery, for the\r\ncutting and polishing of metals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MICA FAMILY.\r\n\r\n123. _COMMON MICA, GLIMMER, or MUSCOVY GLASS, is a mineral substance of\r\nfoliated texture, which is capable of being divided into extremely thin\r\nleaves that have a sensible elasticity, and are transparent._\r\n\r\n_The colour of mica is greenish, sometimes nearly black, reddish, brown,\r\nyellow, or silvery white, with, occasionally, a metallic lustre on the\r\nsurface. Mica is so soft as easily to be scratched; and, when divided\r\nacross the plates, seems rather to tear than break._\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most abundant mineral substances that is known. It\r\nnot only occurs in a massive and crystallized state, but it enters into\r\nthe composition of many rocks; is found filling up their fissures, or\r\ncrystallized in the cavities of the veins which traverse them. In some\r\ncountries, as in Siberia, it is an article of commerce, and is obtained\r\nfrom mines like other minerals. From these it is extracted by hammers\r\nand chisels. It is then washed, to free it from the impurities which\r\nadhere to it; split into thin leaves or pieces; and assorted into\r\ndifferent kinds, according to their goodness, purity, and size. We are\r\ninformed by the Abbé Haüy, that plates of mica a yard or more in width\r\nhave been obtained from the mines in some parts of Russia.\r\n\r\nThin plates of mica are adopted, in many parts of Siberia and Muscovy,\r\nto supply the place of glass for windows. In the shipping of Russia it\r\nis considered preferable to glass, as the concussion produced by the\r\nfiring of the guns does not shatter it. It is employed instead of window\r\nglass in Peru and New Spain; and also in Pennsylvania. Mica may be\r\nadvantageously substituted for horn in lanterns, as it is not only more\r\ntransparent, but is not susceptible of injury from the flame of the\r\ncandle. It has, however, the inconvenience of soon becoming dirty; and\r\nof having its transparency destroyed by long exposure to the air. Mica\r\nis used for enclosing objects that are intended to be viewed by\r\nmicroscopes.\r\n\r\nSo plentiful is this substance in Bengal, that, for the value of five\r\nshillings, as much of it may be purchased as will yield a dozen panes,\r\neach measuring about twelve inches in length and nine in breadth, and so\r\nclear as to allow of ordinary objects being seen through them at the\r\ndistance of twenty or thirty yards.\r\n\r\nMica, when powdered, is sold by stationers on the Continent, in place of\r\nsand, for absorbing ink in writing, but it does not dry sufficiently\r\nquick to be of much use in this respect. In Russia it is employed in\r\ndifferent kinds of inlaid work. It is sometimes powdered, and intermixed\r\nwith the glaze in particular kinds of earthen ware. The heat which melts\r\nthe glaze has no effect on the mica: hence it appears, dispersed\r\nthroughout the glaze, like plates or scales of silver or gold. Some\r\nartists use it in making artificial avanturines (85).\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that the best mica is of a pure pearl colour; and,\r\nwhen split into leaves, presents a smooth surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SOAPSTONE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n124. _STEATITE, or SOAPSTONE, is a soft and unctuous substance, which\r\nhas much the appearance of soap; and is generally of a white or grey\r\ncolour, intermixed with greenish or yellowish shades._\r\n\r\n_It is somewhat more than twice as heavy as water; and is distinguished\r\nfrom indurated talc (135) by not splitting, like that substance, into\r\nslaty fragments._\r\n\r\nIn the counties of Devon and Cornwall, and the islands in the vicinity\r\nof the Lizard Point, this mineral is found in considerable abundance. It\r\npossesses many of the same properties as fullers’ earth, and is, like\r\nthat substance, employed in the scouring of woollen cloths. When mixed\r\nwith water it may be formed into a paste; and, in this state, it is\r\neasily worked, like clay, for the manufacture of earthen ware. In the\r\nporcelain manufactory at Worcester considerable quantities of steatite\r\nare employed. According to Dr. Shaw, the Arabs use it in their baths,\r\ninstead of soap, to soften the skin.\r\n\r\nAs it becomes hard in the fire, and does not alter its shape, this\r\nsubstance has been successfully adopted for imitations of engraved gems.\r\nThe subjects are engraved upon it with great ease in its natural state;\r\nit is then exposed to a strong heat; afterwards polished, and then\r\ncoloured by means of certain metallic solutions.\r\n\r\nWe are informed by travellers, that some of the savage tribes eat\r\nsteatite, either alone, or mixed with their food, to deceive hunger. The\r\ninhabitants of New Caledonia eat considerable quantities of it.\r\nHumboldt, the South American traveller, assures us that the Otomacks, a\r\nsavage race of people, who live on the banks of the Orinoco, are almost\r\nwholly supported, during three months of the year, by eating species of\r\nsteatite, or potter’s clay, which they first slightly bake, and then\r\nmoisten with water. M. Golberry says that the negroes near the mouth of\r\nthe Senegal mix their rice with a white kind of steatite, and eat it\r\nwithout inconvenience.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Spain a variety of steatite is found, which is used by\r\nartists under the name of Spanish chalk. When slightly burned, this\r\nmineral is sometimes used as the basis of rouge.\r\n\r\n125. FIGURE STONE _is a kind of steatite, which has, internally, a\r\nglimmering and resinous lustre, and a slaty or splintery fracture_.\r\n\r\nFrom its softness, and yet solidity of texture, this mineral can easily\r\nbe fashioned into various shapes, even with a knife. Hence in China,\r\nwhere it frequently occurs, it is cut into grotesque figures of various\r\nkinds, which the French call _magots de la Chine_, into cups, vases,\r\npagodas, snuff─boxes, and other articles.\r\n\r\n126. _MEERSCHAUM, or SEA─FROTH, is a singular kind of mineral, of\r\nyellowish or greyish white colour, sometimes so light as to float in\r\nwater: when fresh dug it has nearly the consistence of wax._\r\n\r\n_If exposed to a strong heat, it becomes so hard as to yield sparks with\r\nsteel._\r\n\r\nThe principal use to which meerschaum is applied is in the formation of\r\nthe bowls or heads of tobacco─pipes used by the Turks, and the quantity\r\nconsumed for this purpose is very great. It is found in a fissure of\r\ngrey, calcareous earth, about six feet wide, near Konie, in Natolia,\r\nwhere upwards of six hundred men are employed in the digging and\r\npreparation of it; and the sale of it supports a monastery of dervises\r\nestablished at that place. The workmen assert that it grows again in the\r\nfissure, and puffs itself up like froth. It is prepared for use by being\r\nfirst agitated with water in great reservoirs, then allowed to remain at\r\nrest for some time. The mixture soon passes into a kind of fermentation,\r\nand a disagreeable odour, resembling that of rotten eggs, is exhaled. As\r\nsoon as this smell ceases, the mass is further diluted with water,\r\nwhich, after a while, is poured off. Fresh water is repeatedly added,\r\nuntil the mass is sufficiently washed and purified. The meerschaum, in\r\nthis state, is dried to a certain degree. It is then pressed into a\r\nbrass mould, and, some days afterwards, is hollowed out so as to form\r\nthe head of the pipe. It is subsequently dried in the shade, and lastly\r\nis baked. In this state the pipe heads are brought to Constantinople,\r\nwhere they are subjected to further processes. They are first bailed in\r\nmilk, and next in linseed oil and wax; and, when perfectly cool, are\r\npolished with rushes and leather. The boiling in oil and wax renders\r\nthem capable of receiving a higher polish than could otherwise be given.\r\nWhen thus impregnated, they also acquire, by use, various shades of red\r\nand brown, which are thought to add considerably to their beauty. In\r\nTurkey, and even in Germany, meerschaum pipes that have been much used\r\nare more valued than those newly made, and this solely on account of the\r\ncolouring they possess. Indeed there are people in those countries whose\r\nonly employment consists in smoking tobacco pipes, until they acquire\r\nthe favourite tints of colour. By long use, the heads become black: but\r\nif boiled in milk and soap, they are soon rendered white again.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted that the Turks spread meerschaum on bread, and eat it as\r\na medicine; and that they cover with it the heads and eyes of dead\r\nbodies, previously to interment. As it lathers with water like soap, it\r\nis used by the Turkish women for washing their hair; and, as it absorbs\r\noily matters, it is occasionally used, as fuller’s earth is with us, for\r\nthe cleansing and scouring of cloth.\r\n\r\nWe are informed by Pliny, that a kind of bricks were made by the\r\nancients, so light that, when dried, they would float in water. He\r\ndescribes them to have been formed of a spongy kind of earth, and to\r\nhave had some resemblance to pumice stone, which he says might perhaps\r\nbe applied to the same purposes as these bricks, if it could be obtained\r\nand wrought in sufficient quantity. Bricks of similar description have\r\nlately been made of a mineral substance found near Sienna, in Italy, and\r\nwhich is supposed to be meerschaum.\r\n\r\nA kind of meerschaum has lately been discovered, in veins, in the\r\nserpentine (132) of Cornwall.\r\n\r\n127. _BOLE is an earthy mineral, of yellowish or reddish brown colour,\r\nsoft, and somewhat unctuous to the touch, and generally found in a\r\nmassive state._\r\n\r\n_It exhibits internally a glimmering lustre; and, when put into water,\r\nimmediately absorbs it, and breaks down into small pieces with a\r\ncrackling noise. This mineral is farther distinguished by its fracture\r\nbeing conchoidal, or appearing somewhat like the impression of a shell;\r\nand by its adhering strongly to the tongue._\r\n\r\nAlthough bole is at present little used except as a basis of tooth\r\npowder, and a coarse kind of paint, it was formerly considered an\r\nimportant article in medicine, and used as an astringent. We are\r\ninformed that tobacco pipes are sometimes made of this mineral; and that\r\nit is employed as an ingredient in the glaze of some kinds of earthen\r\nware.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly imported from the Levant; though it has also been found in\r\nconsiderable beds in Silesia and Saxony.\r\n\r\n128. _LEMNIAN EARTH is a kind of bole of yellowish grey, or yellowish\r\nwhite colour, sometimes marbled with rust─like spots._\r\n\r\n_It is distinguished from bole by being dry and not unctuous to the\r\ntouch, dull internally, adhering slightly to the tongue, and its\r\nfracture being earthy._\r\n\r\nWith the ancients this mineral was considered an almost invaluable\r\nmedicine. They procured it chiefly from Armenia, and the island of\r\nLemnos, in the Grecian Archipelago. The Lemnian bole was held so sacred\r\nthat it was dug in the presence of the priests of Venus, and, after\r\nhaving been mixed by them with goat’s blood, was moulded into cakes,\r\nwhich were impressed with the figure of a goat, to authenticate them.\r\nThis done, it was administered as a consecrated remedy; and, even so\r\nlately as the sixteenth century, the vein of bole in Lemnos was annually\r\nopened on the sixth of August, and, after certain prayers by the\r\npriests, so much of the earth was taken out as was thought sufficient\r\nfor the consumption of the ensuing year. The entrance was then closed,\r\nand the severest punishments were denounced against any one who should\r\nopen it without permission. A portion of the earth was sent to\r\nConstantinople, where it was made into small cakes, and sealed by the\r\nministers of the Emperor; the remainder was prepared in the island, and\r\nwas impressed with the seal of the Governor. Not many years ago, it was\r\ncustomary with certain empirics on the Continent, to sell this substance\r\nin sealed packets, as a nostrum of great value, and particularly as\r\npossessing astringent properties of very extraordinary nature.\r\n\r\n129. _FULLER’s EARTH is a well─known mineral, generally of greenish\r\ncolour, more or less mixed with brown, grey, or yellow: of soft and\r\nalmost friable texture, and somewhat unctuous to the touch._\r\n\r\n_When put into water it immediately absorbs it, and breaks down into a\r\nfine pulp._\r\n\r\nThis earth is valuable for its property of taking grease out of woollen\r\nand other cloths, which, on a large scale, is effected by the operation\r\ncalled _fulling_, whence its name has been derived. This operation,\r\nwhich is performed by a kind of water mill, called a _fulling mill_, is\r\nparticularly necessary with respect to new cloths, to extract from them\r\nthe grease and oil that have been used in their preparation.\r\n\r\nFuller’s earth was formerly considered an article of such importance in\r\nEngland that its exportation was prohibited under severe penalties. It\r\nwas then employed for most of those purposes for which soap has since\r\nbeen so extensively applied. In the dressing of cloth it is now so\r\nindispensable, that foreigners, although they can procure the wool, are\r\nnever able, without fuller’s earth, to reach the perfection of the\r\nEnglish cloths: and, in this country, incalculable quantities of it are\r\nconsumed. As an article of domestic utility, it might be much more\r\nfrequently used than it is, as a substitute for soap, in the cleaning\r\nand scouring of wooden floors and wainscots.\r\n\r\nThere are extensive beds of fuller’s earth in several of the counties of\r\nEngland. London is principally supplied from those of Kent, Sussex, and\r\nSurrey. At Wavedon, near Woburn, in Bedfordshire, a peculiarly fine kind\r\nis dug up from pits at the depth of ten or twelve feet below the surface\r\nof the ground; and no country in the world is known to produce fuller’s\r\nearth of quality so excellent as that obtained in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TALC FAMILY.\r\n\r\n130. _JADE, or NEPHRITE, is a very hard and tough species of stone, of\r\ngreenish or olive colour, somewhat unctuous to the touch, and looking as\r\nif it had imbibed oil._\r\n\r\n_It is found massive, in blunt─edged or rounded pieces._\r\n\r\nNothing has so much tended to make this stone known, as a superstitious\r\nnotion that a piece of it suspended to the neck will dissolve stones in\r\nthe kidneys. Hence has been attained its appellation of nephrite, or\r\ndivine stone; and hence have originated all those numerous amulets in\r\nthe form of oval plates, hearts, fishes, birds, &c. pierced with holes\r\nfor ribbons to pass through, which are seen in collections of the\r\ncurious. Some of the Indian nations make talismans of jade.\r\n\r\nFrom the roughness and tenacity of this stone, in addition to its\r\nhardness, it is very difficult to be cut and polished; and even the best\r\npolish which it is capable of taking as so imperfect, that a person\r\nignorant of its nature might consider it to be merely smoothed and\r\nrubbed with oil. The ancient artists executed in it many beautiful and\r\ndelicate figures; and it is impossible but to admire the industry and\r\nperseverance by which they produced even chains, and other hollow kinds\r\nof work, in jade.\r\n\r\nThe Turks cut it into handles for sabres and daggers, and into several\r\nkinds of vessels, to which they attach great value.\r\n\r\nJade occurs in granite (251) and gneiss (255) in Switzerland; but the\r\nmost beautiful specimens of this mineral are brought from Persia, Egypt,\r\nand Siberia.\r\n\r\n131. AXESTONE _is a kind of jade, but differs from it in having a slaty\r\ntexture; and in being less transparent and less tough_. This stone is\r\nfound in China, New Zealand, and on the banks of the river of Amazons,\r\nin America. And it is said that several of the tribes of American\r\nIndians form of it the axes which they use in place of iron. To explain\r\nhow these people have been enabled to work a substance so rebellious as\r\nthis is even to the file, and to other instruments of steel (of which\r\nthey know not the use), it has been presumed that, when the stone is\r\nfirst taken from the earth, it is considerably less hard than when, by\r\ndrying, its humidity is evaporated: that in this state they work it, and\r\nsubsequently harden it, in some peculiar manner, by exposure to heat.\r\n\r\n132. _SERPENTINE is a stone which, when polished, has a near resemblance\r\nto marble, is of dark green colour, or reddish; variously streaked, and\r\nspotted with lighter green, red, brown, and yellow._\r\n\r\n_It is found in beds, and in a massive state; is translucent at the\r\nedges; and, when pounded, the powder feels soapy to the touch._\r\n\r\nThere are few stones likely to prove more valuable in ornamental\r\narchitecture, both for beauty and durability, than this. It admits of an\r\nexcellent polish, which is not easily injured by the effects of air or\r\nwater. It is also too hard to suffer the same inconveniences of being\r\nscratched or broken as marble; and its colours are stated to be\r\nindestructible. And such is the size of many of the blocks of\r\nserpentine, that columns of almost any dimensions may be wrought out of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOf the serpentine obtained from the Island of Anglesea, and lately known\r\nby the name of _Mona marble_, a great proportion was sent to London by\r\nMessrs. Bullock and Co. who, until the death of Mr. Bullock, had a large\r\nwarehouse and polishing rooms for it in Oxford─street. The prevailing\r\ncolours of this stone are red and green. The quarries were worked by\r\nthem to considerable extent. They manufactured it into chimney pieces,\r\nslabs, columns, and other articles; and its great beauty, and its\r\nexcellence, in many respects, over the generality of marbles, will\r\nrecommend it strongly to the public notice.\r\n\r\nThe chief places in which serpentine has hitherto been found are near\r\nBareuth, and Zöblitz, in Saxony; in some districts of Cornwall; about\r\nsix miles west of the Paris copper mine, in the island of Anglesea; at\r\nPortsoy, in Bamffshire, and other parts of Scotland; and at Cloghan Lee,\r\nin the county of Donegal, Ireland.\r\n\r\nAt Zöblitz there are some extensive manufactories, in which serpentine\r\nis made into vessels and ornaments of various shapes, that are carried\r\nfor sale over nearly all parts of Germany. Several hundred persons are\r\nthere employed in the working of this stone.\r\n\r\nThe name of serpentine is derived from some of the varieties appearing\r\ncoloured and spotted like a serpent’s skin. This stone, when found\r\nintermixed with primitive limestone, or crystalline white marble,\r\ndiffers in no respect from the celebrated _verde antique_ marble (149).\r\n\r\n133. _POTSTONE, or LAPIS OLLARIS, is a greenish grey stone, unctuous to\r\nthe touchy and so soft when first taken from the quarry as to yield to\r\nthe pressure of the nail, yet not easily broken._\r\n\r\n_It is found in a massive state._\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the softness and tenacity of this stone, it can be\r\nturned upon a lathe, and otherwise cut and wrought with great ease.\r\nHence, in Egypt, Lombardy, Norway, and other countries where it is\r\nfound, it is formed into various kinds of culinary vessels and lamps,\r\nwhich harden in drying, and are capable of withstanding the strongest\r\naction of fire. Vessels of this description were known to the ancients;\r\nand are particularly mentioned by Pliny, the Roman naturalist, who\r\nspeaks of some that were highly wrought being very valuable.\r\n\r\nPotstone is used in some countries for the lining of stoves, furnaces,\r\nand ovens; and it is so durable as to have, in some instances, stood\r\nunimpaired for several hundred years.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Lake Como, there were some extensive quarries of\r\npotstone, which had been worked from the beginning of the Christian era.\r\nThese quarries, however, fell in, on the 25th of August, 1618, and\r\ndestroyed the neighbouring town of Pleurs; which had previously obtained\r\nby means of them an annual revenue of about sixty thousand ducats.\r\n\r\n134. _COMMON, or VENETIAN TALC, is an earthy stone, capable of being\r\ndivided into plates or leaves, which are soft and unctuous to the touch,\r\nsomewhat transparent, and usually of greenish silvery white colour._\r\n\r\n_It leaves a white trace when rubbed upon any object._\r\n\r\n_Mica and talc have a near resemblance to each other; but the plates of\r\nthe former, when bent, are elastic, while those of the latter are not._\r\n\r\nVenetian talc is very abundant in the Tyrol and the Valteline. In a\r\nstate of powder it renders the skin soft and shining; a property which\r\nappears to have suggested the idea of employing it as the basis of the\r\ncosmetic named _rouge_. This is prepared by rubbing together, in a warm\r\nmortar, certain proportions of carmine, or extract of the flowers of\r\n_carthamus tinctorius_, with finely powdered talc, and a certain portion\r\nof oil of benzoin.\r\n\r\nThe Romans prepared a beautiful blue or purple colour, by combining\r\npounded talc with the colouring fluid of some particular kinds of\r\ntestaceous animals, that are found among the submarine rocks of the\r\ncoasts of the Mediterranean. According to Tavernier, the French\r\ntraveller, the Persians whiten the walls of their houses and gardens\r\nwith lime, and then powder them with a silvery white kind of talc;\r\nwhich, he says, gives to them a very beautiful appearance. Talc is now\r\nused by the Chinese, and was formerly used by the Europeans, in\r\nmedicine,\r\n\r\n135. _INDURATED TALC, or FRENCH CHALK, is a heavy mineral, of close\r\ntexture, and generally of greenish grey colour; unctuous to the touch,\r\nand having a somewhat slaty fracture._\r\n\r\n_It is found in a massive state; and leaves a white trace when rubbed\r\nupon any object._\r\n\r\nThis is a well known substance, which is in great request by carpenters,\r\ntailors, hat─makers, and others, as the lines that are drawn with it are\r\nnot so easily effaced as those that are made with chalk, and\r\nparticularly as they remain unaltered even under water. If lines be\r\ntraced with it on glass, they remain invisible, or at least are scarcely\r\nperceptible by the naked eye, till breathed upon. This, it has been\r\nconjectured, in part depends on the comparative softness of the\r\nsubstance with which the impression is made; the condensation of the\r\nbreath taking place more readily on the glass than on the talc that\r\ncovers it, and the impression of the talc becoming more apparent by the\r\ncontrast.\r\n\r\nIndurated talc, when reduced to powder, is frequently employed for the\r\npurpose of removing stains, occasioned by grease, from silk and cloth.\r\nThis it does effectually, and, in general, without injuring even the\r\nmost delicate colour. Like potstone, it is sometimes manufactured into\r\nculinary vessels.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is found in several parts of the continent of Europe; and\r\nin Cornwall, Scotland, and the Shetland Islands.\r\n\r\n136. _ASBESTOS is a greenish or silvery white mineral, of fibrous\r\ntexture, which is found in many mountainous countries of the Continent,\r\nin the island of Anglesea, and in Scotland. It occurs in shapeless\r\nmasses, and varies much both in weight and hardness._\r\n\r\nThe name of asbestos is derived from the Greek language, and signifies\r\nthat which is inconsumable. This mineral, and particularly a silky\r\nvariety of it, in long slender filaments, called _amianthus_, was well\r\nknown to the ancients. They made it into an incombustible kind of cloth,\r\nin which they burned the bodies of their dead, and, by which means, they\r\nwere enabled to collect and preserve the ashes without mixture. In the\r\nmanufacture of this article they were not able to weave the asbestos\r\nalone; but, in the loom, were obliged to join with it linen or woollen\r\nthreads, which were afterwards burned away.\r\n\r\nIncombustible cloth was purchased by the Romans at an enormous expense.\r\nSir J. E. Smith, when at Rome, saw a winding sheet of amianthus in the\r\nMuseum of the Vatican. It was coarsely spun, but as soft and pliant as\r\nsilk. The person who attended him set fire to one corner of it; and the\r\nsame part burned repeatedly with great rapidity and brightness, without\r\nbeing at all injured. This interesting relic was discovered, in the year\r\n1702, in a funeral urn, and contained burned bones, together with a\r\nquantity of ashes. It was nine Roman palms long, and about seven in\r\nwidth, and had been deposited in the library of the Vatican by order of\r\nPope Clement the Eleventh.\r\n\r\nCloth made of amianthus, when greased, or otherwise contaminated with\r\ndirt, may be cleansed by throwing it into a bright fire. In this process\r\nthe stains are burned out, and the cloth is restored to a dazzling white\r\ncolour. Pliny, the Roman naturalist, informs us that he had himself seen\r\ntable─cloths, towels, and napkins of amianthus taken from the table of a\r\ngreat feast, thrown into the fire, and burned before the company: and by\r\nthis operation, he says, they became better cleansed than if they had\r\nbeen washed.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of some parts of Siberia manufacture gloves, caps, and\r\npurses of amianthus; and in the Pyrenees it is wrought into girdles,\r\nribbons, and other articles. The finest girdles are made by weaving the\r\nmost beautiful and silky filaments with silver wire. These are much\r\nprized by the women, not only on account of their beauty, but from\r\ncertain mysterious properties they are supposed to possess.\r\n\r\nThe shorter fibres of amianthus have sometimes been manufactured into\r\npaper, but this is too hard for use. It has, indeed, been proposed to\r\npreserve valuable documents from fire, by writing them on paper made of\r\namianthus. Such a plan might deserve consideration, if we possessed\r\nfire─proof ink; but until this be obtained, the fire─proof paper will be\r\nof little use.\r\n\r\nWhen several of the long fibres of this mineral are placed together,\r\nthey may be formed into wicks for lamps; and it has been asserted that\r\nsuch wicks are incombustible. Kircher, the German philosopher, had a\r\nwick made of amianthus which burned for two years without injury, and\r\nwas at last destroyed by accident. It is said that the inhabitants of\r\nGreenland make use of amianthus for the wicks of their lamps.\r\n\r\nThis substance, although it will long continue unaltered in considerable\r\nheat, yet if the heat be much increased it ceases to withstand it, and\r\nis melted into a dense kind of scoria. In the island of Corsica asbestos\r\nis advantageously employed in the manufacture of pottery. Being reduced\r\ninto fine filaments, it is kneaded with clay; and vessels made of this\r\nmixture are said to be lighter, less brittle, and more capable of\r\nsustaining sudden alterations of heat and cold than common earthenware.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHRYSOLITE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n137. _CHRYSOLITE, or PERIDOT, is a soft gem, usually of yellowish green\r\ncolour, though sometimes it is grass─green, or bluish green, but with a\r\ntinge of brown._\r\n\r\n_It is generally found in fragments and rounded pieces, and rarely\r\ncrystallized. In the latter case its regular form is an eight, ten, or\r\ntwelve─sided prism._\r\n\r\nThough scarcely harder than glass, and consequently inferior to most\r\nother gems in lustre, these stones are not unfrequently used in\r\njewellery, particularly for necklaces and ornaments for the hair; and,\r\nwhen well matched in colour, and properly polished, their effect is very\r\ngood. They are, however, too soft for ring stones; for, by wearing, they\r\nsoon become dull on the surface. But it is said that their lustre may,\r\nin some degree, be restored by immersing them in olive oil.\r\n\r\nTo give the greatest brilliancy to this stone, we are informed by Mr.\r\nMawe, that a copper wheel is used, on which a little sulphuric acid, or\r\nspirit of vitriol (24), is dropped; and that, during the process, an\r\nhighly suffocating odour is given out. But he is of opinion that the\r\nmost advantageous way of working it would be that in which glass is cut.\r\n\r\nChrysolite is imported from the Levant, and is said to be found in Upper\r\nEgypt, and on the shores of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BASALT FAMILY.\r\n\r\n138. _BASALT is a greyish black and coarse grained stone, which is\r\nusually found either in globular distinct pieces or in groups of large\r\ncolumns, each of which has from three to eight sides, and is divided\r\nhorizontally into numerous stones, that very exactly lie upon, or fit\r\ninto each other._\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable assemblages of basaltic columns that are known are\r\nthose called the _Giants’ Causeway_, on the coast of Antrim, in Ireland,\r\nand the _Cave of Fingal_, in the island of Staffa, one of the Hebrides,\r\nor Western Islands of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe former, which is believed by the common people to have been an\r\nartificial production, the vast labour of giants who formerly inhabited\r\nthe country, consists of an irregular group of many thousand jointed\r\npillars. Most of these are of considerable height; are in general\r\nfive─sided, fifteen or sixteen inches in diameter, and each perfectly\r\ndistinct from top to bottom, though so closely and compactly arranged\r\nthat it is scarcely possible to introduce any thing betwixt them. This\r\nassemblage of columns extends into the sea to a distance unknown, and\r\nalong a tract of the sea coast of nearly six miles.\r\n\r\nThe Cave of Fingal is accessible only by sea, and is formed by ranges of\r\nmassive basaltic columns, fifty feet and upwards in height. The stone of\r\nwhich these columns are formed very much resembles that of the Giants’\r\nCauseway.\r\n\r\nIn several parts of the world large masses of basalt are discovered,\r\ncomposing entire insulated mountains, of somewhat conical form. They are\r\nconsidered by some writers as volcanic productions, but the proofs of\r\nthis are by no means satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAmongst the uses to which basalt has been applied, two of the most\r\nimportant are as materials of an excellent and durable kind for building\r\nand paving. When burned and pulverized, these stones impart to mortar\r\nwith which they are mixed the property of hardening under water. They\r\neasily melt, without any addition, into an opaque and black glass; and\r\nfrom them, under a certain modification, bottles of olive─green colour,\r\nand of extreme lightness, but great strength and solidity, have been\r\nformed. Some of the kinds have been advantageously employed as\r\nmillstones. Basalt is occasionally used by artists for touch or\r\nteststones, to ascertain the purity of gold and silver; and goldbeaters\r\nand bookbinders, on the Continent, usually make their anvils or beating\r\nblocks of it.\r\n\r\nBasalt, though harder, more brittle, and less pleasing in its colours\r\nthan marble, was in considerable esteem among the sculptors of\r\nantiquity, on account of its great durability. Many fine works were\r\nconsequently executed by them in this stone. Pliny, who has described\r\nseveral, states that the columns of it were sometimes so large as to\r\nadmit of several figures being wrought out of them. The Emperor\r\nVespasian had an entire statue, accompanied by the figures of sixteen\r\nchildren, cut out of a single column of basalt; this statue he placed in\r\nthe Temple of Peace, and dedicated it to the Nile. The famous statue of\r\nMinerva, at Thebes, is described by travellers to have been formed of\r\nbasalt. Antiques of basalt are always in a much better state of\r\npreservation than those of marble. Even such as are dug out of the earth\r\nstill retain their original polish; and the finest touches of the chisel\r\nupon them are still unimpaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n                       ORDER III.—SALINE STONES.\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n\r\n                      LIME, OR CALCAREOUS FAMILY.\r\n\r\n139. Lime, after it has been freed from extraneous matters by burning,\r\nis a mineral of whitish colour, and pungent, acrid, and caustic taste.\r\nIt has the property of changing vegetable blue colours to green, and of\r\ncorroding and destroying animal substances.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is found in nearly every country of the globe: but, in a\r\nnative state, has not hitherto been discovered except in combination\r\nwith some acid.[3] The process of purifying lime, or depriving it of the\r\nacid with which it is combined, is by burning. This is done in a large\r\nkind of furnace, called a _kiln_, where the limestone and fuel are\r\nheaped in alternate layers. After it has gone through this process it is\r\ncalled _quick─lime_, and has the above─mentioned appearance and\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  With _carbonic acid_ (26) it forms common limestone, marble, chalk,\r\n  and some other substances; with _sulphuric acid_ (24) it constitutes\r\n  alabaster, or gypsum; and with _fluoric acid_ (27) it becomes that\r\n  beautiful production, the Derbyshire spar.—All these, having lime for\r\n  their bases, are denominated CALCAREOUS SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nThe uses of lime are numerous and important. The principal of these is\r\nin the formation of _mortar_, or cement for buildings. For this purpose\r\nit is first _slaked_, by having water poured upon it: a violent heat is\r\nthereby excited, and the lime falls into powder: it is then formed into\r\npaste by working it with water and sand. This, when dry, becomes\r\nextremely solid, hard, and durable. Various examples might be mentioned\r\nof buildings nearly two thousand years old, where the lime is, at this\r\nday, as hard as the stones which it cements together. Lime is also used\r\nfor agricultural purposes: when spread upon land it is supposed to\r\nhasten the dissolution and putrefaction of all kinds of animal and\r\nvegetable substances, and to impart to it a power of retaining the\r\nmoisture which is necessary for the vigorous growth of corn or grass. It\r\nis employed in the refining of sugar, in the manufacture of soap, in the\r\nmelting of iron, and by tanners, in a state of solution, for dissolving\r\nthe gelatinous parts of skins, and removing the hair from them. The\r\nmanufacturers of glue mix it with that article, for the purpose of\r\nadding to its strength, and preventing its becoming flexible by the\r\nabsorption of moisture. This mineral, if well dried, pounded, and\r\nmingled with gunpowder, in the proportion of one pound to two, is of\r\ngreat utility in the rending of stones and rocks: the mixture, it is\r\nsaid, will cause an explosion equal in force to three pounds’ weight of\r\ngunpowder. Lime, if swallowed or inhaled, is a virulent poison. Hence\r\npersons employed in lime─works are subject to very distressing\r\ncomplaints; and hence, if bread be adulterated with lime, it is\r\nextremely injurious. Notwithstanding this pernicious quality, lime is of\r\nconsiderable use in medicine. It is chiefly given in a state of\r\nsolution, and in the proportion of half a pound of quick─lime to twelve\r\npints of boiling distilled water. This preparation is called _lime\r\nwater_.\r\n\r\nThe superb basin of Lampi, one of the principal reservoirs which\r\nfurnishes the canal of Languedoc with water, was, some years ago, found\r\nto leak at the junction of the stones. The engineer who had the\r\ndirection of the works caused lime to be slacked in the water. This,\r\npassing through the apertures betwixt the stones, formed a crust, or\r\nvery white covering, over its whole surface, of so hard and durable a\r\nnature, that it now constitutes one solid and undivided substance, which\r\nthe water cannot penetrate.\r\n\r\nCARBONAT OF LIME.\r\n\r\n140. _COMMON LIME is a variety of carbonat of lime, or of lime in\r\ncombination with carbonic acid (26), which is harder and heavier than\r\nchalk, usually of a greyish colour, and is always found in a massive\r\nstate._\r\n\r\nVast mountains of limestone occur in several countries of the globe; but\r\nno where is lime more abundant than in some parts of England and Wales.\r\nIt forms, in particular, nearly the whole mountainous districts of\r\nDerbyshire and Shropshire, and encloses, in its substance, numerous\r\nveins of lead ore, calamine, and other important mineral productions.\r\n\r\nIts uses have been already described (139).\r\n\r\n141. _CHALK is a white or yellowish kind of limestone, too well known to\r\nneed any description._\r\n\r\nIt is found abundantly in many of the southern counties of England, and\r\nis usually procured from large open places, called chalk─pits, by\r\ndigging. In some parts of Kent, however, the workmen save themselves, in\r\nthis respect, much trouble. They undermine the sides of hills to a\r\ncertain depth, then dig a trench at the top as far distant from the edge\r\nas the mining extends at the bottom. This trench they fill with water,\r\nwhich soaks through during the night, and the whole mass is thereby\r\nloosened, and falls down before morning.\r\n\r\nThe harder and more compact kinds of chalk are cut into blocks, and used\r\nas building stones. When burned and formed into lime, chalk becomes an\r\nexcellent mortar: nearly all the houses in London are cemented with\r\nchalk mortar. It is also used as lime in agriculture. As it readily\r\nimbibes water, it is used by starch─makers, chemists, and others, to dry\r\nprecipitates upon. With isinglass or the white of eggs it forms a\r\nvaluable lute or cement. By artists it is in request for the\r\nconstruction of moulds to cast metals in; and by carpenters and others,\r\nas a material to mark with. Chalk is one of the most useful absorbents\r\nthat are employed in medicine: it likewise gives name to an officinal\r\nmixture, to a powder, and a potion.\r\n\r\nWhen pounded and cleared from gritty particles, it has the name of\r\n_whiting_. In this state it is used for the cleaning and polishing of\r\nmetallic and glass utensils; for whitening the ceilings of rooms, and\r\nnumerous other purposes. _Spanish white_ is the same substance cleansed\r\nwith peculiar care; and the _Vienna white_, which is used by artists, is\r\nperfectly purified chalk.\r\n\r\n142. _MARBLE is a compact and close─grained kind of limestone; so hard\r\nas to admit of being polished. It is this quality which principally\r\ndistinguishes it from other calcareous substances._\r\n\r\nAlthough nearly all the numerous kinds of marble may be burned, and thus\r\nconverted into quick─lime, their use in ornamental architecture, &c. is\r\nso important as, in general, to prevent their application to the\r\ninferior purpose of mortar. Marble has been known from a very early\r\nperiod. The Book of Esther, in the Old Testament, describes the palace\r\nof Ahasuerus to have had “pillars of marble,” and the pavement of “red,\r\nand blue, and white, and black marble.”\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible, in an elementary work like the present, to\r\ndescribe, or even to enumerate, all the different kinds of marble which\r\nwere known to the ancients, or are known to the moderns. But it is,\r\nperhaps, requisite that an account should be given of some of the most\r\nimportant of them.\r\n\r\n_GREEK MARBLES._—143. PENTELIC MARBLE _is of beautiful white colour, and\r\nnearly resembles the Parian marble_ (145) of the Italians; but it is in\r\ncoarser granulations. Sometimes it is splintery. It was obtained from\r\nquarries on Mount Pentelicus, near Athens, and was generally preferred,\r\nby the Grecian artists, to Parian marble. The Pantheon was built\r\nentirely of Pentelic marble; and many of the Athenian statues, and works\r\ncarried on near Athens during the administration of Pericles, were\r\nexecuted in it. Dr. Clarke, however, has observed that while the works\r\nwrought of Parian marble remain perfect to the present time, those of\r\nPentelic marble have been decomposed by the atmosphere, and sometimes\r\nexhibit a surface as rude and earthy as common lime─stone. There are\r\nnumerous examples of Pentelic marble in those works of Phidias which\r\nform the Elgin collection in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n144. GREEK WHITE MARBLE.—_The Marmo Greco, of Italian artists, is of\r\nsnow─white colour, in fine granulations_; and somewhat harder, and\r\nconsequently capable of higher polish, than most other white marbles. It\r\nis found near the river Coralus, in Phrygia.\r\n\r\n_ITALIAN MARBLES._—145. PARIAN MARBLE _is of snow─white colour,\r\ninclining to yellowish white_. It is obtained from quarries in the\r\nisland of Paros, is finely granular, and, when polished, has somewhat of\r\na waxy appearance. Parian marble hardens by exposure to the air, and is\r\none of the most permanent kinds that is known. Varro and Pliny each\r\nstate that it was named _lychnites_, by the ancients, from a Greek word\r\nsignifying a lamp, because it was generally hewn in quarries by the\r\nlight of lamps. The finest Grecian sculpture that has been preserved to\r\nthe present time is of Parian marble. The principal statues of it now\r\nextant are the Medicean Venus, the Diana Venatrix, and Venus leaving the\r\nBath. It is also Parian marble on which the celebrated tables at Oxford\r\nare inscribed.\r\n\r\n146. CARRARA MARBLE, the purest of all the kinds with which we are\r\nacquainted, is to this day obtained from quarries near the town of\r\nCarrara. _It is of brilliant white colour, has a granular texture; and,\r\nwhen broken, sparkles like sugar._ This marble, which is almost the only\r\none in use by modern sculptors, was also quarried and wrought by the\r\nancients.\r\n\r\nIt is susceptible of a high polish, and is applicable to every species\r\nof sculpture, except when, as is too often the case, dark veins intrude,\r\nand spoil the beauty of the work. In the centre of the blocks a\r\nbeautiful kind of rock crystals, called _Carrara diamonds_, are\r\nsometimes found.\r\n\r\nDuring the late war with France, the exportation of statuary marble from\r\nthe countries under the dominion of Buonaparte was prohibited; and, at\r\none time, it became so scarce in England as to be sold at the rate of\r\nmore than seven guineas per cubic foot. The block of marble for the\r\nstatue of his late Majesty in the great Council Chamber at Guildhall,\r\nLondon, was stated by the public prints to have cost twelve hundred\r\nguineas.\r\n\r\n147. LUNI MARBLE _is a snow─white, compact, and finely granular\r\nvariety_, which was obtained by the ancients from quarries on the coast\r\nof Tuscany. It was preferred by the Grecian sculptors, both to the\r\nParian and Pentelic marbles; and it is usually supposed that the\r\nBelvidere Apollo, as well as the Antinous of the Capitol, was wrought\r\nout of this marble. There is now found at Luni a white marble,\r\nvariegated with red spots and dots.\r\n\r\n148. GREEN ANTIQUE MARBLE, or VERDE ANTIQUE _of the Italians, is a\r\nmixture of white marble and green serpentine_ (132). This is believed to\r\nhave been obtained from some part of Italy, but the quarries are not now\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n149. SIENNA MARBLE _is of close texture, and yellowish colour, disposed\r\nin large irregular spots, surrounded with veins of bluish red, passing\r\nsometimes into purple_. It is not uncommon in the vicinity of Sienna,\r\nand is in great request, throughout Europe, for chimney─pieces and\r\nornamental furniture.\r\n\r\n150. BROCATELLO MARBLE is somewhat like the last; but is also\r\nirregularly marked with various shades of red, and, in some parts, with\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n151. MANDELATO MARBLE _is of light red colour, with yellowish white\r\nspots_. It is found at Lugezzana, in the Veronese. Another variety,\r\nbearing the same name, occurs at Preosa.\r\n\r\n152. VERDE DI PRATO MARBLE _is a green marble, marked with darker green\r\nspots_, which is found near the town of Prato in Tuscany.\r\n\r\n153. LAGO MAGGIORE MARBLE _is a beautiful kind, white, with black spots\r\nand dots_. It has been employed for decorating the interior of many\r\nchurches in the Milanese.\r\n\r\n154. BRETONICO MARBLE.—This beautiful marble, which is found near the\r\nvillage of Bretonico, in the Veronese, _is varied with yellow, grey, and\r\nrose colour_.\r\n\r\n_FRENCH MARBLES._—155. Many valuable kinds of marble are obtained from\r\ndifferent parts of the French territory.\r\n\r\n156. CAMPAN MARBLE.—Three kinds of marble are known by this name, all of\r\nthem procured from immense quarries at Campan, near Bagnere, in the\r\nPyrenees. The first, called _Green Campan_, is of pale sea─green colour,\r\nand exhibits, on its surface, lines of much deeper green, forming a kind\r\nof net─work. The second, called _Isabel Campan_, is of delicate rose\r\ncolour, with undulating green veins. The third variety, the _Red\r\nCampan_, is of deep red colour, with veins of still deeper red. The\r\ngreen variegations in this stone are formed by a talcy mineral,\r\nintermixed with the lime─stone.—The Campan marble is well adapted for\r\nslabs, tables, chimney─pieces, and other ornamental purposes in the\r\ninterior of buildings; but, if exposed to the weather, the talcose\r\nsubstances perish, and leave hollow spaces which render its surface\r\nrough and uneven.\r\n\r\n157. GRIOTTE MARBLE _is of a deep brown colour, with blood─red oval\r\nspots, formed by shells_. Its name has been obtained from its brownish\r\ncolour, being similar to that of the cherries that are called by the\r\nFrench _griotte_. This marble has, of late, been much used in the\r\ndecoration of public monuments, and in splendid furniture, in France.\r\nSome of the ornaments of the Triumphal Arch of the Carousel are made of\r\nit. The department of Herault is the part of France from which it is\r\nobtained. It sometimes contains large white veins, which destroy the\r\nharmony of the other tints.\r\n\r\n158. MARQUESE MARBLE.—This, which is obtained from quarries, near the\r\nvillage of Marquese, between Calais and Boulogne, is marked with\r\n_different shades and variegations of white and brown_. Of this marble\r\nBuonaparte commenced a magnificent column on the heights near the sea,\r\nat Boulogne, to commemorate his victories; but, since his dethronement,\r\nthe erection of this structure has been discontinued.\r\n\r\n159. SARENCOLIN MARBLE _is distinguished by exhibiting large zones, and\r\nangular spots of yellow or blood─red colour_. It is found at Sarencolin,\r\nin the High Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n160. ST. BEAUME, or LANGUEDOC MARBLE, _is of light red colour, marked\r\nwith white and grey zones, formed by madrepores_. The eight columns\r\nwhich adorn the Triumphal Arch, in the Carousel at Paris, are of this\r\nmarble. It is obtained from quarries at St. Beaume, in the department of\r\nAude.\r\n\r\n161. BRECCIA MARBLE OF THE PYRENEES.—One kind of this marble contains\r\nblack, grey, and red, middle─sized spots in a brownish red ground. It\r\nadmits of a good polish. Another kind has an orange─yellow─coloured\r\nground, containing small fragments of snow─white colour. Both these are\r\nfound in the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n_SPANISH MARBLES._—162. Few countries are more productive of marble than\r\nSpain; and in few countries are the public monuments and buildings more\r\nprofusely decorated with marble. The vault of the theatre of Toledo is\r\nsupported by 350 marble columns; and an ancient mosque at Cordova is\r\nornamented with 1200 columns, most of which are of Spanish marble. The\r\npalace and church of the Escurial, and many of the churches in Madrid,\r\nare decorated with marbles of the most beautiful description.\r\n\r\n163. WHITE SPANISH MARBLE.—Near Cordova; at Filabres, three leagues from\r\nAlmeria, in Grenada; and in some other parts of Spain, white marble is\r\nobtained, which is susceptible of a good polish, and is well adapted to\r\nthe general purposes of sculpture.\r\n\r\n164. SEVILLE MARBLE _is a beautiful red variety, with shining red and\r\nwhite spots and veins_. In the vicinity of TORTOSA is found a kind of\r\nmarble which has a _violet ground, spotted with bright yellow_; and near\r\nGRENADA a marble of _green colour_, which somewhat resembles the\r\ncelebrated verde antique (149).\r\n\r\n165. SPANISH BRECCIA.—There are several beautiful varieties of breccia\r\nin Spain. At Riela, in Arragon, there is one, composed of angular\r\nportions or fragments of black marble, embedded in a reddish yellow\r\nbase. The breccia marble of Old Castile is of bright red colour, dotted\r\nwith yellow and black, and encloses fragments of pale yellow, brick─red,\r\ndeep brown, and blackish grey colour.\r\n\r\n_GERMAN MARBLES._—166. Germany abounds in marbles, and affords many\r\nkinds which are remarkable both for beauty and singularity. Of these the\r\nkind best known is\r\n\r\n167. LUMACHELLI MARBLE.—_This exhibits beautiful iridescent colours,\r\nwhich are sometimes prismatic internally, but more commonly of various\r\nshades of red or orange_; whence it has also obtained the name of _fire\r\nmarble_. Few kinds of marble are more generally admired than this. It\r\nhas a dark ground, and is marked throughout with the appearance of small\r\nwhitish shells, which, in certain parts, refract the most beautiful and\r\nbrilliant colours. This marble is cut into the tops and bottoms of\r\nsnuff─boxes, and several other ornamental articles. It is found in veins\r\nat Bleyberg, in Carinthia.\r\n\r\n168. Many beautiful kinds of marble are obtained from the island of\r\nSICILY, particularly one called _Sicilian jasper_, which is red, with\r\nstripes like ribbons, white, red, and sometimes green. SWITZERLAND\r\nabounds in marbles; PORTUGAL, SWEDEN, and NORWAY afford few. In the\r\nRUSSIAN EMPIRE many have been noticed, particularly among the Uralian\r\nmountains. The late Empress Catharine caused an immense palace to be\r\nbuilt for her favourite Orloff, which is entirely coated, both inside\r\nand outside, with marble. She built the church of Isaac with marbles of\r\ndifferent kinds, on a vast space, near the statue of Peter the Great, in\r\nPetersburgh. We are at present very imperfectly acquainted with the\r\nmarbles of ASIA. Dr. Shaw mentions a red marble obtained from Mount\r\nSinai; and Mr. Morier, in his journey through Persia, speaks of a\r\nbeautiful translucent kind which he calls _marble of Tabriz_, and the\r\ncolours of which are light green, with veins sometimes of red, sometimes\r\nof blue. He says it is cut into large slabs, some of which he describes\r\nto have measured nine feet in length, and five feet in breadth.—No\r\naccount has hitherto been published of the marbles of AFRICA.—In the\r\nUnited States of AMERICA many kinds of marble have been discovered, some\r\nof which have been wrought, and polished; but very imperfect\r\ndescriptions have yet been given of them.\r\n\r\n169. Few countries produce a greater variety of excellent marbles than\r\nthe BRITISH ISLANDS. Although these marbles are seldom noticed much\r\nbeyond the limits of the districts in which they occur, many of them are\r\nadmirably adapted for ornamental purposes; particularly for slabs and\r\nchimney─pieces. It is much to be regretted that we should send to\r\nforeign countries for stones which, in many instances at least, could\r\ncertainly be as well supplied from our own. The following is an\r\nenumeration of a few of the most important kinds.\r\n\r\n_ENGLISH MARBLES._—170. PETWORTH MARBLE, when cut into slabs, is equal,\r\nboth in beauty and quality, to many of the marbles imported from the\r\nContinent. The Earl of Egremont has, at Petworth, several chimney─pieces\r\nformed of it. Much of this marble was used in the cathedral church of\r\nCanterbury. The pillars, monuments, vaults, pavement, and other parts of\r\nthat venerable structure, have been formed of it. The archbishop’s chair\r\nis an entire piece of Petworth marble. This marble is found in greatest\r\nperfection upon an estate of the Earl of Egremont, at Kirdford. It lies\r\nat the distance of from ten to twenty feet under the surface of the\r\nground, and in flakes or strata nine or ten inches in thickness.\r\nPetworth marble is also an excellent stone for walls; and, for paving,\r\nit cannot be excelled. When burned, it also constitutes a valuable\r\nmanure, superior, as some farmers imagine, even to chalk.\r\n\r\n171. PURBECK MARBLE is obtained from the island of Purbeck, in\r\nDorsetshire. _It is of dark colour, and contains numerous small round\r\nshells_, which, when it is cut and polished, mark it with roundish\r\nvariegations of brown, dark green, and grey. This marble was formerly\r\nmore used than it is at present. Several of the small columns, and many\r\nof the monuments, in the churches of Dorsetshire, and the adjacent\r\ncounties, are formed of it. But it is not so durable as many other\r\nkinds. Wherever it is long exposed to the weather, the surface cracks,\r\nsplits off, and becomes defaced.\r\n\r\n172. BABBICOMBE MARBLE is one of the most beautiful kinds that is found\r\nin any country. _It varies in colour, from light brown to deep red_; and\r\nlarge slabs of it have been obtained that are elegantly and diversely\r\nmarked, some in streaks, others in spots, and others in different\r\ncoloured shades.\r\n\r\nThis kind is quarried at Babbicombe, in Torbay, Devonshire, and is\r\nextensively manufactured into chimney─pieces in the West of England. An\r\nattempt was lately made to introduce it in London; but, from its not\r\nbeing the production of a foreign country, this has failed of success.\r\n\r\n173. DERBYSHIRE MARBLE.—There are, in Derbyshire, several kinds of\r\nmarble, most of which contain an abundance of fossil shells, and other\r\nremains of marine animals. At Wetton, near Ashbourne, a beautiful kind\r\nis obtained, of greyish black colour, which contains a vast number of\r\nwhitish and very minute shells. This has the name of _bird’s eye\r\nmarble_. Near Monyash a beautiful variety is found, of a cheerful\r\ncolour, inclining to brown red, and full of large marine figures in all\r\ndirections; these, when the marble is cut, appear white, and afford a\r\npleasing contrast.\r\n\r\n174. KENDAL MARBLE.—Some varieties of black, grey, and brown marble, are\r\nwrought near Kendal, in Westmoreland. These somewhat resemble the\r\nDerbyshire marbles; and, like them, are manufactured into\r\nchimney─pieces, and ornamental slabs for houses. Several of the slabs\r\nare found to contain corallines, and the remains of other marine\r\nanimals, which vary their appearance in a very pleasing manner.\r\n\r\nThe MONA MARBLE is a species of serpentine intermixed with white\r\nlimestone: it has been already described (132).\r\n\r\n_SCOTTISH MARBLES._—Scotland affords many valuable and beautiful\r\nvarieties of marble.\r\n\r\n175. TIRIE MARBLE.—Few of the British kinds of marble have been more\r\nadmired than that obtained from Tirie, one of the Western Islands of\r\nScotland. _It is of a reddish, sometimes a delicate rose─coloured tint,\r\nand sometimes white; and is always intermixed with other minerals which\r\nadd to its beauty._ The most common of these is of black colour, and\r\ncalled hornblende; the others are pale green sahlite, blackish brown\r\nmica (123), and green chlorite. In some varieties the hornblende is more\r\nabundant than the marble.\r\n\r\n176. ASSYNT MARBLE.—At Assynt, in Sutherland, _a white marble_ has been\r\ndiscovered, which is perfectly solid and pure, and entirely free from\r\nblemishes or stains. Blocks or slabs of it may be cut of almost any size\r\nthat can be required. This marble acquires a smooth surface, but remains\r\nof a dead hue; whence, of course, its uses as an ornamental marble are\r\nmuch circumscribed.\r\n\r\n177. ISLE OF SKY MARBLE.—There is found in the Isle of Sky a marble of\r\npure white colour, which appears capable of yielding large and valuable\r\nblocks. Its fracture is granular and splintery, and its texture fine. It\r\nis harder, heavier, and more compact than the marble of Carrara (146);\r\nand is apparently well fitted for all the purposes of sculpture. But it\r\nhas the defect of being very unequally hard. While some parts of the\r\nstone are nearly as easy to work as that of Carrara, other parts are so\r\nhard as to add a charge of near fifty per cent. to the cost of the\r\nworking.\r\n\r\n178. SUTHERLAND MARBLE.—Some beautiful specimens of marble of dark brown\r\ncolour, veined with whitish, light red, or light brown, have lately been\r\nbrought from the county of Sutherland. These appear of close texture,\r\nare susceptible of a beautiful polish, and are capable of being wrought\r\ninto extremely beautiful slabs for chimney─pieces and other ornamental\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n179. GLEN TILT MARBLE _is of white or grey colour, and veined or spotted\r\nwith yellow or green; some specimens are nearly white_. The granulations\r\nare peculiarly large; and, in its aspect and composition, the Glen Tilt\r\nhas great general resemblance to the Pentelic marble (143). This marble\r\nhas of late attracted the notice of the Duke of Athol, through the\r\nsuggestion of Dr. Macculloch; and chimney─pieces of it have since been\r\nmade. It is obtained from a valley of the same name in the county of\r\nPerth.\r\n\r\n180. BLAIRGOWRIE MARBLE.—A few miles from Blairgowrie, in Perthshire,\r\nthere is an excellent granulated broad─bedded marble, _of sugar─loaf\r\ntexture, and as white as the finest statuary marble_. It may be easily\r\nraised in blocks and in slabs of great size, perfectly free from\r\nblemishes. This marble is supposed to be well adapted for ornamental\r\narchitecture, but its large sparry texture renders it unfit for the\r\nsculptor.\r\n\r\n181. GLENAVON MARBLE _is of white colour, with large granular\r\nconcretions_, somewhat like spangles, and as large as the scales of\r\nfishes. This is a valuable kind; but its situation in the forest of\r\nGlenavon, on the property of the Duke of Gordon, is remote and difficult\r\nof access.\r\n\r\n182. BALLICHULISH MARBLE.—On the north side of the ferry of\r\nBallichulish, in Lochaber, there is a rock of marble, of beautiful\r\n_ash─grey colour_, and of a fine, regular, and uniform grain, which is\r\ncapable of being wrought into blocks or slabs of any size, and is\r\nsusceptible of a fine polish. This marble is finely sprinkled throughout\r\nwith grains and specks of pyrites (236), and with grains and specks of a\r\nbeautiful lead ore, which to the eye appears to be rich in silver. If\r\nused for ornamental purposes, it would be a bright and beautiful\r\nmetallic marble.\r\n\r\n183. BLAIRMACHYLDACH MARBLE.—In the bed of a river, at the farm of\r\nBlairmachyldach, about three miles south of Fort William, is a singular\r\nmarble, consisting of _a black ground, flowered with white_. It is of\r\nfine close grain, but not very hard. The flowering in it is light, and\r\nbeautiful, like fine needle─work, or rather resembling the frosty\r\nfret─work upon glass windows, in a winter morning.\r\n\r\nThe cutting and polishing of marble appear to have been performed by the\r\nancients nearly in the same manner as it is with us. In polishing, the\r\nfirst substance employed is a sharp, coarse─grained sand. Afterwards a\r\nfiner sand is used, then emery (58) in different degrees of fineness.\r\nThese are followed by a red powder called tripoli (119): and the last\r\npolish is given with putty.\r\n\r\n184. _BLACK MARBLE is a species of limestone, of uniform black colour,\r\nand easily distinguishable, by an excessively disagreeable smell, which\r\nis emitted on rubbing two pieces of it together, or striking it with a\r\nhammer._\r\n\r\nFew minerals are susceptible of a more beautiful polish than this. It is\r\nconsequently much used for chimney─pieces, small columns, vases, and\r\nother ornamental work. There are two quarries of black marble near\r\nBakewell, in Derbyshire: and it is manufactured to a considerable extent\r\nby Messrs. Brown and Co. at Derby, who have fixed up in their ware─rooms\r\na large slab of it as a looking─glass.\r\n\r\nBy the ancients it was much prized. Marcus Scaurus is said to have\r\nornamented his palace with columns of black marble, each thirty─eight\r\nfeet high; and many of the monuments of ancient Persepolis were executed\r\nin it. M. D’Avejan, Bishop of Alais, used a kind of black marble for\r\npaving the apartments of his palace; but the friction and heat rendered\r\nit so fetid that his successors were compelled to substitute another\r\nspecies of stone in its place.—The pavements, however, of many churches,\r\nand of the porticos of several galleries, on the Continent, are of black\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\n185. _CALCAREOUS ALABASTER is a species of limestone of somewhat whitish\r\nor yellowish colour, translucent, and internally splendent or shining._\r\n\r\n_It is nearly a pure carbonat of lime; and occurs in masses, hanging,\r\nlike immense icicles, from the roofs of lime─stone caverns, and also\r\ncoating the sides of such caverns._\r\n\r\nThe formation of this substance is deserving of notice. The water which\r\noozes through the crevices of limestone rocks, becomes strongly\r\nimpregnated with minute particles of lime. This water, when it has\r\nreached the roof or side of a cavern, is generally suspended, for a\r\nconsiderable time, before a drop of sufficient size to fall by its own\r\nweight is formed. In the interval which thus elapses, some of the\r\nparticles of lime are separated from the water, owing to the escape of\r\nthe carbonic acid (26), and adhere to the roof. In this manner\r\nsuccessive particles are separated, and are attached to each other,\r\nuntil what is called a _stalactite_, having somewhat the appearance of\r\nan icicle, is formed. These stalactites are sometimes solid, having a\r\nlamellar structure; sometimes of a fibrous texture, radiating from the\r\ncentre to the circumference, as may be observed when they are broken;\r\nand sometimes hollow. If the water collects and drops too rapidly to\r\nallow time for the formation of a stalactite, it falls upon the floor,\r\nand there forms an irregular lump of alabaster, which has the name of\r\n_stalagmite_. In some caverns, the separation of the calcareous matter\r\ntakes place both at the roof and on the floor; and, in course of time,\r\nthe substance upon each increasing, they meet, and form pillars,\r\nsometimes of great magnitude.\r\n\r\nCaverns of this kind occur in almost every country. Those of Derbyshire\r\nare well known; but the most celebrated stalactitic cave in the world is\r\nthat of Antiparos, in the Grecian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe kind of limestone formed in the above manner is what the ancients\r\ngenerally denominated _alabaster_. It was employed by them for the same\r\npurposes as marble, was cut into tables, columns, vases, and sometimes\r\neven into statues. They also used it in the manufacture of vases or\r\nboxes for containing unguents. It is supposed to have been a vessel\r\nformed of this stone that is mentioned in the Gospel of St. Matthew,\r\nwhere it is said there came unto our Saviour “a woman having an\r\nalabaster box of precious ointment.” In the National Museum at Paris\r\nthere is a colossal figure of an Egyptian deity, which is cut in a kind\r\nof alabaster brought from the mountains between the Nile and the Red\r\nSea.\r\n\r\n186. _TUFA, or INCRUSTING CARBONAT OF LIME, is a calcareous substance\r\ndeposited by such water as is impregnated with lime._\r\n\r\n_It clothes, with a stony coat, the smaller branches of trees, leaves,\r\nmoss, plants, and other substances; and thus preserves them from decay,\r\nby protecting them from the action of the atmosphere._\r\n\r\nMost of the substances termed by the common people _petrifactions_\r\nbelong to this kind of lime. They are, however, merely covered with, and\r\nby no means converted into stone.\r\n\r\nThe dropping well at Knaresborough, in Yorkshire, is particularly\r\ncelebrated for them. An overhanging rock, several yards in depth, has\r\nbeen gradually formed of the calcareous matter which the water holds in\r\nsolution; and, from this rock, it incessantly drops into the basin\r\nbelow. The persons who have the care of the place constantly keep these\r\npetrified articles for sale. Even old wigs and hair brooms are subjected\r\nto the powers of the water, to furnish subjects for attraction to the\r\nvisitors. There are other springs of this description in Oxfordshire and\r\nSomersetshire, and particularly at Matlock, in Derbyshire. We are\r\ninformed that at Dalton, on the south side of Mendip, the workmen not\r\nunfrequently discover large pieces of oak enveloped in blocks of stone\r\nwhich are four or five tons in weight.\r\n\r\nBlocks of tufa are, in some countries, cut and used for building stones;\r\nand this substance, when burned, becomes an excellent lime. Pieces of it\r\nare sometimes hollowed, and used as filtering stones.\r\n\r\nIn the British Museum there is a human skull completely incrusted with\r\nstone, which was found in the river Tiber.\r\n\r\nThe warm baths of Hungary are often so thickly coated at the sides and\r\nbottom with tufa, that, during certain intervals, it actually fills up\r\nthe tubes and canals through which they are supplied. The _fur in\r\nteakettles_ is a somewhat similar deposit from water in boiling.\r\n\r\n187. _PORTLAND STONE, BATH STONE, KETTON STONE, are different kinds of\r\nlimestone; and, of a texture so hard and compact as to be used in\r\nbuilding._\r\n\r\n_They have their names from the places where they are respectively\r\nfound, in Portland Island, near Bath, and at Ketton, in the county of\r\nRutland._\r\n\r\nOf Ketton stone several of the colleges in Cambridge are built. Its\r\ngrain has a singular resemblance to the petrified roe of a fish, whence\r\nalso it is sometimes called _roestone_. The bridges, St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral, the Monument, and nearly all the buildings of late date in\r\nLondon, are constructed of Portland stone.\r\n\r\nSome of these kinds of stone, when first dug out of the quarry, are so\r\nsoft that they are readily worked into any form which use or ornament\r\nmay require. This is owing to the moisture with which they are naturally\r\nimpregnated; but when they once become hardened, by exposure to the sun\r\nand air, they are extremely firm and solid. On the contrary, other kinds\r\nof limestone that are used for buildings imbibe and retain the moisture\r\nof the atmosphere, in consequence of which they burst or are crumbled by\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nWe are informed that Portland stone was first used in London in the\r\nreign of James the First, that monarch, by the advice of his architects,\r\nhaving employed it in the construction of the banquetting house at\r\nWhitehall. After the great fire in London, it was brought into general\r\nuse by Sir Christopher Wren.\r\n\r\n188. _MARL is a combination of clay, silex (76), and lime: and is\r\ndenominated calcareous, argillaceous, or siliceous, as the lime, clay,\r\nor silex, is most abundant._\r\n\r\nThe calcareous part of marl is frequently composed of shells, whence it\r\nfrequently has the name of _shell marl_; and where these are\r\npredominant, it affords an excellent manure for sandy, dry, gravelly, or\r\nlight lands. Marl likewise produces very beneficial effects on mossy and\r\nclayey soils; and these effects, where it has been properly applied,\r\nhave been observable for twelve or fourteen years. Some kinds of marl\r\nthat contain but a small portion of lime have been successfully used in\r\nthe manufacture of earthenware.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is usually found at the depth of from five to nine feet\r\nbeneath the surface of the ground, and deposited between beds of clay\r\nand sand. It is dug out with spades; and, in the digging of it, in\r\nIreland, the workmen not unfrequently meet with the horns of deer and\r\nother curious fossils.\r\n\r\nThe usual mode by which persons, generally unacquainted with minerals,\r\ndistinguish this from other clayey substances, is, to break a small\r\npiece of dry marl into a glass of vinegar. If it be marl it will\r\nimmediately dissolve with considerable effervescence; and the briskness\r\nof the effervescence will be in proportion to the quantity of lime which\r\nit contains.\r\n\r\n189. _FLORENCE MARBLE is a kind of indurated or hardened marl, and is\r\nremarkable for presenting, when polished, the appearance of ruined\r\nedifices or rocks._\r\n\r\nThis kind of marble is never used in architecture. Little slabs of it\r\nare cut for Mosaic work, and to be framed like pictures; and the latter,\r\nwhen of considerable dimensions, are sometimes purchased at a high\r\nprice. If held at a distance from the eye, an inexperienced observer\r\nmight mistake a slab of Florence marble for a drawing in bistre. Here,\r\nobserves a French writer, we remark a shattered Gothic castle, there the\r\nmouldering fragments of a cathedral; in one part ruined walls, and in\r\nanother shattered bastions and towers. But, when we approach the\r\npicture, the illusion vanishes, and those imaginary figures which, at a\r\ndistance, appeared to be so correctly drawn, become changed into\r\nirregular spots, lines, and shades, which present nothing distinct to\r\nthe view.\r\n\r\n190. COTTAM MARBLE, which, when cut and polished, also exhibits the\r\nappearance of a landscape, is a kind of compact marl. It has its name\r\nfrom being found at Cottam, near Bristol.\r\n\r\n191. _LIAS, or CALP is a kind of limestone of bluish black, or greyish\r\nblue colour, and composed chiefly of lime, silex (76), clay, and oxide\r\nof iron (21)._\r\n\r\nThis stone, when burned, forms a cement which has the property of\r\nsetting very strongly under water. It has also, of late years, been\r\nemployed in a manner which merits particular notice, for the multiplying\r\nof copies of drawings and penmanship. A drawing is made on prepared\r\npaper with a peculiar kind of ink. A slab of lias, about an inch thick,\r\nis then heated; the drawing is placed upon it, and both are passed\r\nthrough a rolling press. The paper is afterwards wetted, and washed from\r\nthe stone; but the ink, being of a gummy or glutinous quality, becomes\r\nin part absorbed by the stone, and remains. The stone is then ready for\r\nthe printer. Previously to taking off each impression, the stone is\r\nwetted with a sponge; fresh ink (which is said somewhat to resemble\r\nprinters’ ink, and is put on with a ball similar to that used by\r\nletter─press printers) is then applied. This is prevented, by the water,\r\nfrom adhering to any part except to the ink that had been absorbed, by\r\nthe stone, from the paper on which the drawing was originally made.\r\nPaper is then placed on the stone, both are passed through a rolling\r\npress as before, and a perfect impression of the drawing is made upon\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\nThis art has been practised in Germany with great success; and with the\r\ndifference only of the original drawing being made upon the stone\r\ninstead of paper. Many beautiful specimens of drawings, taken from slabs\r\nof lias, may be seen in this country. It is said that copies of military\r\ndrawings and orders were, to a very large amount, multiplied by this\r\nmeans at the headquarters of the armies lately employed on the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nAn artificial composition is sometimes used instead of lias.\r\n\r\nConsiderable quarries of this stone are wrought in Germany. It is also\r\nfound at Leixlip, near Dublin; in beds at Aberthaw, in Glamorganshire;\r\nin Dorsetshire, and near Bath.\r\n\r\nSULPHAT OF LIME.\r\n\r\n192. _ALABASTER, or GYPSUM, is a kind of sulphat of lime, or of lime in\r\ncombination with sulphuric acid (24), which has a shivery and glittering\r\ntexture; and is of white colour tinged with grey or red, and sometimes\r\nstriped, veined, or spotted. When crystallized, the primitive form of\r\nits crystals is a regular four─sided prism_ (Pl. II, Fig. 14.)\r\n\r\nBeing considerably softer than marble, this mineral is not capable of\r\nreceiving a good polish. From this circumstance it is, however, the more\r\neasily worked. It is manufactured into chimney─pieces, columns, busts,\r\nornamental vases, and lamps; the latter of which transmit a soft and\r\npleasing light. Such is sometimes the transparency of alabaster, that it\r\nhas been employed for windows; and, at Florence, there is now a church\r\nwhich receives its light through the medium of this substance.\r\n\r\nThe ancients, though acquainted with the art of making glass, had not\r\nattained the knowledge of reducing it into thin transparent plates; and\r\nfrequently employed alabaster for windows. Of this stone the Temple of\r\nFortune, which was built by order of the Emperor Nero, was erected. It\r\nhad no windows whatever, and received only a soft kind of light through\r\nits walls; appearing rather as if the light issued from the interior,\r\nthan that it was admitted from without.\r\n\r\nThe hot springs of St. Philip, which supply the baths of Tuscany, are so\r\nstrongly impregnated with alabaster, that artists take advantage of this\r\nto obtain impressions of bas─reliefs, by merely exposing their moulds to\r\na current of the water until they become filled with the earthy deposit.\r\nThese impressions, when taken out, are found to be as hard as marble,\r\nand are very beautiful. There are, in the British Museum, some casts of\r\nmedals formed from the water of these springs.\r\n\r\nWhen alabaster is heated, it falls into a soft white powder, which, on\r\nbeing mixed with water, absorbs it so rapidly, that if it be formed into\r\na paste, it dries and becomes hard in a few minutes. In this state it is\r\ncalled _plaster of Paris_; and is employed for the making of statues,\r\ncasts, and other ornamental work, which, though of a beautiful white\r\ncolour, are very brittle. When mixed with coloured gummy or glutinous\r\nsubstances, it yields plasters of different hues, and has the name of\r\n_stucco_; and, in this state, is used for lining the walls and ceilings\r\nof rooms. This plaster is much in request in the northern counties of\r\nEngland, for the floors of dairies, store─rooms, granaries, and other\r\napartments; and, when properly formed, it constitutes a very smooth and\r\ndurable flooring.\r\n\r\nThe fine white varieties of gypsum are used as an ingredient in the\r\ncomposition of earthenware and porcelain; and the glaze, or enamel, with\r\nwhich porcelain is covered, has the purest gypsum for one of its\r\ningredients. Of late years this mineral has been advantageously employed\r\nas a manure for fertilizing the soil.\r\n\r\nGypsum is found in Cheshire and Derbyshire, as well as in several parts\r\nof the Continent. That which is imported into this country from Italy\r\nand Spain is considered the best.\r\n\r\n193. FIBROUS GYPSUM.—There is a variety of gypsum which has a somewhat\r\nfibrous appearance, and which, when cut in a convex form, and polished,\r\nreflects a light not much unlike that of the cats─eye (86). Hence it is\r\nsometimes sold to ignorant persons for that stone. It has also been\r\nimposed upon purchasers for the gem called moonstone (113). Fibrous\r\ngypsum is cut into ear─pendants, crosses, beads for necklaces, and other\r\nfemale ornaments; but its softness is such as to allow of its being\r\neasily injured both by dirt and friction.\r\n\r\nFLUAT OF LIME.\r\n\r\n194. _FLUOR SPAR, or DERBYSHIRE SPAR, is a mineral formed by the\r\ncombination of lime with fluoric acid (27)._\r\n\r\n_It sometimes occurs in a massive, and sometimes in a crystallized\r\nstate; the primitive form of its crystals being a regular octohedron_\r\n(Pl. II, Fig. 5). _Its colour is usually bluish, green, yellow, whitish,\r\nor a mixture of some of these._\r\n\r\nWhen heated, this substance cracks, and shines brightly in the dark. But\r\nif kept hot for some time, it ceases to be luminous, and this property\r\ncannot be restored to it. If also two pieces be rubbed strongly\r\ntogether, they become luminous in the dark.\r\n\r\nFrom this spar are made several kinds of ornamental vases of\r\nconsiderable size, columns, and toys, which, from being extremely varied\r\nin their colours and appearance, and admitting of a high polish, are\r\nvery beautiful. When a piece of fluor spar is to be wrought into a vase,\r\nor any similar article, it is first carved with a mallet and chisel into\r\na somewhat spherical form. It is then fixed to a turner’s lathe, and,\r\nwith great care, is formed into the shape that is required. When this is\r\ncomplete, it has to be polished, which is done first with gritstone and\r\npumice (108), and lastly with emery (58) and putty. The lathes formerly\r\nin use were worked by the foot; but those now adopted are worked by\r\nmachinery, the advantage of the more steady motion of which has been\r\nthat ornaments of much more delicate structure can now be formed than\r\nbefore. The manufacture of articles from fluor spar gives employment to\r\na great number of industrious families in Derbyshire. This mineral\r\noccurs in several parts of that county, where it has the name of _Blue\r\nJohn_, and where it is obtained from caverns at a considerable depth\r\nbeneath the surface of the earth. It is also found in various countries\r\nboth of the European and American continents.\r\n\r\nThe acid produced from fluor spar is called _fluoric acid_ (27), and has\r\nthe peculiar property of corroding glass and flint, and consequently\r\ncannot be kept in glass bottles. Artists, by means of fluoric acid, are\r\nenabled to etch on glass, in the same manner as, with aqua fortis\r\n(nitric acid), they do on copper. The process is sufficiently simple.\r\nThe glass is first a little heated, for the purpose of covering it\r\nthinly over with wax; then, with a needle or other fine point the\r\ndrawing is to be made, by cutting through the wax to the surface of the\r\nglass. The edges are next to have a little wall of wax raised upon them.\r\nThis done, the glass must be placed in an horizontal position, and\r\nsifted over with fluor finely pounded; and lastly, a mixture of one part\r\nof spirit of vitriol or sulphuric acid (24) with two or three parts of\r\nwater is to be poured gently upon it. The acid will be prevented from\r\nrunning off by the wax; and, in the course of a little while, if these\r\nbe cleared away, the glass will be found corroded in all the lines along\r\nwhich the needle passed.\r\n\r\nThe mode of obtaining fluoric acid for chemical purposes is, by pouring\r\nsulphuric acid upon powdered spar in a leaden retort, and applying to it\r\na gentle heat. This acid should be used with great caution; for, when\r\napplied to the skin, it instantly disorganizes it, and produces very\r\npainful sores.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BARYTES FAMILY.\r\n\r\n195. These minerals are sometimes called _ponderous earths_, and have\r\ntheir name from a Greek word signifying _heavy_. They comprehend all the\r\ncombinations of barytes with acids.\r\n\r\nWhen purified, they form a greyish white, porous substance, which is\r\neasily reducible to powder; has no perceptible smell, but has a harsh\r\nand more burning taste than lime, and changes the blues of vegetable\r\ncolours to green.\r\n\r\nAlthough barytes is one of the most useful chemical tests that we are\r\nacquainted with, it is not much employed in the arts, because, when\r\npurified, it is found too expensive. It is capable of being made into a\r\nvery tenacious cement; and painters use a preparation that is made from\r\nit as a white colour which will not change. This is sold in the shops\r\nunder the name of “Hume’s permanent white.” Barytes taken into the\r\nstomach proves a virulent poison; yet a preparation of it is used in\r\nmedicine, and particularly for the removal of scrophulous complaints.\r\nWhen finely pounded and mixed with oatmeal, _carbonat of barytes_ has\r\nbeen found an efficacious poison for rats.\r\n\r\n196. _SULPHAT of BARYTES is a mineral formed by the combination of\r\nsulphuric acid (24) with barytes._\r\n\r\n_It sometimes occurs in a state of powder, frequently in shapeless\r\nmasses, and often crystallized: the primitive form of its crystals being\r\na four─sided prism. It is not soluble in any other than sulphuric acid._\r\n\r\nWith us sulphat of barytes is of no use in the arts. The Chinese,\r\nhowever, employ it as an ingredient in the composition of porcelain; and\r\nit is said to form a good manure for clover fields.\r\n\r\n_The_ BOLOGNA PHOSPHORUS, _or_ BONONIAN STONE, _a very remarkable kind\r\nof barytes, has its name from being found near Bologna in Italy._ This\r\nsubstance, when detached, is usually observed in roundish, flat,\r\nkidney─shaped pieces, from about the size of a walnut to that of an\r\norange, which have a shining and somewhat fibrous texture within.\r\n\r\nWhen the outer coat of this stone is washed away by heavy rains, it has\r\nsometimes the appearance of burnished silver. An Italian shoemaker, in\r\nthe year 1630, deceived by this appearance, carried home several pieces,\r\nhoping, by means of fire, to extract silver from them. But at the same\r\ntime that he was disappointed in this expectation, he was surprised by a\r\nvery unlooked─for phenomenon. All the pieces which he had thus attempted\r\nto melt, when they were afterwards exposed to the light, became\r\nthemselves luminous. It is the singular property of the Bologna\r\nphosphorus, after it has undergone calcination in a particular manner,\r\nto become capable of imbibing so much light on exposure, for a little\r\nwhile, to the light of the sun, or even to the flame of a candle, that\r\nit will afterwards shine in the dark for an interval of from eight to\r\nfifteen minutes, like a glowing coal, but without any sensible heat. The\r\nlight which it emits is sufficient to read by, provided the letters be\r\nplaced near it. If well prepared, the stone will retain this\r\nextraordinary property for five or six years.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of it is thus conducted. Pieces of sulphat of barytes\r\nare made red hot, for a few minutes, in a covered crucible placed in the\r\nmiddle of a fire, and then left to cool. When cool, they are pounded in\r\na stone mortar, and sifted. The powder thus formed is made into a paste\r\nwith a little gum arabic, and divided into long cakes, or cylinders,\r\neach about a quarter of an inch thick. These pieces are dried in a\r\nmoderate heat, and then, by degrees, are exposed to a more violent heat,\r\namong charcoal, in a wind furnace. As soon as the coals of the furnace\r\nare half consumed, it must be filled a second time, and the phosphorus\r\nmust be left undisturbed. When the coals are quite consumed the ashes\r\nmust be carefully blown off with a pair of bellows, and the phosphorus\r\nwill be found at the bottom of the grate.\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CLASS II.—SALTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ORDER I.—EARTHY SALTS.\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ALUMINE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n197. _ALUM is a substance of yellowish or greyish white colour, usually\r\nopaque, but sometimes transparent. When purified, it consists of\r\nslender, irregular, hair─shaped fibres, and has a sweetish, astringent\r\ntaste._\r\n\r\nThe alum of commerce is an artificial production from the different\r\nkinds of stones which contain it. That called _Roman alum_, from its\r\nbeing procured from the neighbourhood of Rome, is usually considered\r\npreferable to the other sorts; but good alum of our own manufacture is\r\nequal to it in quality. The Levant, or _Roche alum_, is said to have had\r\nits name from the village of Rocca, the present Edessa, in Syria.\r\n\r\nThere is a famous alum mine at Tolfa, near Civita Vecchia, in Italy. The\r\nalum is obtained from this mine nearly in a pure state; and it is so\r\nextremely hard, that it can only be wrought by means of pickaxes, and\r\ngunpowder. At Solfatara, near Naples, and in other volcanic countries,\r\nan abundance of alum is found, in a state of efflorescence, from the\r\nlava.\r\n\r\nThe alum of our own country is manufactured from a kind of slaty stone\r\nwhich is found near Whitby, in Yorkshire. This manufactory was first\r\nestablished about the conclusion of the sixteenth century, by Sir Thomas\r\nChaloner, who is supposed to have obtained his knowledge of the process,\r\nfrom the alum works which had then lately been introduced into Germany\r\nand Spain. The rock of _alum slate_, near Whitby, is supposed to be\r\nnearly twelve miles in extent: and affords an abundant supply of alum.\r\nThe workmen tear open the rock; after which the different fragments are\r\nloosened, in the form of slaty leaves or plates, that are of a dark grey\r\ncolour. To obtain the alum, a bed of fagots is formed from ten to twelve\r\nfeet in depth. By the side of this a scaffold is erected, which enables\r\nthe workmen to form a pile of mineral about fifty feet long, and forty\r\nfeet high. While this pile is forming, the fagots are lighted. By the\r\ngradual operation of the heat, a calcination takes place, in consequence\r\nof which the alum is afterwards rendered capable of being more easily\r\nseparated than it otherwise would be from the stone in which it was\r\ncontained, and from other extraneous matters that are combined with it.\r\nAfter this, the mineral is washed in shallow vessels, so arranged that\r\nthe water may be poured from one into the other. By this process the\r\nalum becomes suspended in the water, while all the earthy particles\r\nsubside to the bottom. The next operation is to evaporate the water\r\nsaturated with alum. This is done by boiling it in large leaden\r\ncaldrons, fixed, on cast iron bars, over a furnace. As soon as the\r\ncontents of the caldrons are brought to a proper state, they are drawn\r\noff into casks, where the alum concretes into a mass. The hoops are then\r\ntaken off, and the alum is broken and left to dry; after which it is\r\npacked in casks for sale.\r\n\r\nAlum is an article of indispensable importance to dyers, not only on\r\naccount of its cleansing and opening the pores of the substances to be\r\ndyed, and thus rendering them fit to receive the colouring particles,\r\nbut also from its more essential property of fixing the colours in such\r\nmanner that they cannot afterwards be washed out. By tanners it is in\r\ngreat request for giving firmness to the skins after they have been\r\nrendered flaccid in the lime─pits. It is employed in the manufacture of\r\npaper, and by engravers, and other artists. In the making of candles,\r\nalum is added to the tallow, to render it glossy, and to give it greater\r\nfirmness and consistence; and, mixed with cream, it aids the separation\r\nof butter. It has a tendency to retard ignition. Paper soaked in alum\r\nwater does not easily take fire, and is thereby better fitted for the\r\npreservation of gunpowder. Such paper is likewise used in the whitening\r\nof silver, and the silvering of brass. It has been recommended that\r\nladies’ muslin dresses should be dipped in a solution of this substance,\r\nfor the purpose of rendering them less liable to catch fire. A solution\r\nof alum also retards the putrefaction of animal substances, and affords\r\nuseful, as well as economical, means of preserving natural productions\r\nthat are imported from foreign countries. Alum is frequently mixed with\r\npaste, to prevent its losing its tenacity by the absorption of moisture.\r\nIt is asserted that bakers occasionally use it as an ingredient in\r\nbread, and that its presence may be discovered by thrusting a heated\r\nknife into a loaf before it is cold: if free from alum, scarcely any\r\nalteration will be visible on the blade, but if the contrary, the\r\nsurface, when cool, will appear slightly covered with an incrustation of\r\nalum. A very important purpose to which alum may be applied is in the\r\npurifying and sweetening of water that has become fetid and unfit for\r\nuse; from five to ten grains of burned alum, and double or treble that\r\nquantity of pounded charcoal, will correct the fetor of a gallon of\r\nwater. Printers’ cushions, and the blocks used for the printing of\r\ncalicos, are rubbed with burned alum to remove any greasiness, which\r\notherwise would prevent the ink or colour from sticking. This substance\r\nis also occasionally employed by surgeons to stop the bleeding of small\r\nvessels, to corrode fungous or proud flesh, and for other purposes in\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         198. MAGNESIA FAMILY.\r\n\r\nThis is a family of minerals which comprehends all the combinations of\r\nmagnesia with acids.\r\n\r\nWhen freed from extraneous matters, magnesia is a powdery substance of\r\nlimpid white colour.\r\n\r\n199. _EPSOM SALTS, or SULPHAT OF MAGNESIA, consist of magnesia in\r\nconjunction with sulphuric acid (24)._\r\n\r\nIt is said that Epsom salts have been found in the Alps, and in\r\nSwitzerland, under a powdery form, and sometimes even in masses, or a\r\nstate of incrustation on stones and rocks. They are, however, chiefly\r\nfound dissolved in mineral waters, and particularly in those at Epsom in\r\nSurrey, and Sedlitz in Bohemia. Their taste is bitter and unpleasant. So\r\nlittle are they affected by exposure to the air, that the Abbé Haüy kept\r\nsome by him for more than twelve years without any sensible alteration.\r\n\r\nThese salts are much used in medicine, and are sometimes manufactured\r\nfrom the waters of Epsom (290) and Sedlitz (289), but more frequently,\r\nand in much greater abundance, from sea─water.\r\n\r\nThe _magnesia_ of the shops is prepared by dissolving Epsom salts in\r\nwater, and adding to the solution half their weight of potash (205). The\r\nsubstance that sinks to the bottom is magnesia; and this, washed with a\r\nsufficient quantity of water and dried, has the appearance of a light,\r\nsoft, and white powder, of insipid taste.\r\n\r\nMagnesia is used in medicine, both in a simple state and when calcined\r\nor burned. It is also employed in some chemical processes; and is in\r\nconsiderable request in the manufacture of enamel and porcelain. If\r\nputrid water be agitated with a small quantity of magnesia, it will lose\r\na considerable portion of its bad taste and smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           200. SODA FAMILY.\r\n\r\nSoda, like potash (205), is an extremely caustic alkali (42). It has a\r\ngreyish white colour, and agrees exactly with potash (205) in taste,\r\nsmell, and corrosive quality, but it is not so heavy.\r\n\r\nIn a mineral state soda has hitherto been found only in combination with\r\nsome acid.\r\n\r\nCommon salt (202) is a compound of soda with muriatic acid (29).\r\n\r\nThe soda of commerce is obtained from sea─water; and from the ashes of\r\ndifferent kinds of plants that grow on the sea─shores, but particularly\r\nfrom that called _salsola soda_, which is found in great abundance on\r\nthe coasts of the southern parts of Europe; and from which it has its\r\nname. It is sometimes called _barilla_, from the salsola soda being so\r\ndenominated in Spain.\r\n\r\nThis alkali is of essential use in the arts. When melted with flint or\r\nsand, it forms glass, and answers much better for this purpose than\r\npotash. In conjunction with oil and lime, it is employed in the\r\nmanufacture of soap; and it is used as a substitute for soap in the\r\ncleaning and bleaching of linen, flannels, and worsted goods. If a weak\r\nsolution of soda be poured into foul bottles, or casks in which wine has\r\nlong been kept, it will cleanse them. It may also be successfully used\r\nfor the cleansing of vessels in which milk has become acid. Saddles,\r\nbridles, or boot─tops, may be effectually cleaned by means of this\r\nliquor, and restored nearly to their original colour and appearance.\r\n\r\nThe art of _soap─boiling_ may easily be illustrated by the following\r\nexperiment. Take a piece of quick─lime, slake it gradually by sprinkling\r\non it a sufficient quantity of water. When it is completely slaked, add\r\nto it about twenty times its weight of water. To this mixture add two\r\nparts, by weight, of common subcarbonat of soda, previously dissolved in\r\na sufficient quantity of water. Boil the whole for about half an hour,\r\nstrain it through a cloth, and boil it till so much of the water is\r\nevaporated that a phial that will contain an ounce of water will hold\r\none ounce, seven pennyweights and a half, of this ley. Then mix in an\r\nearthenware pipkin or basin, one part of the ley, with two parts of\r\nolive oil. Place the mixture in a gentle heat, capable only of making\r\nthe liquor simmer, and allow it to simmer, stirring the liquor\r\ncontinually, with a wooden stick, till, by letting a few drops of it\r\nfall on a plate, the soap will be found to coagulate, and the water\r\nbecome speedily separated from it. After which, pour out the contents\r\ninto a cup, and suffer it to cool.—Soap may also be prepared without\r\nheat. If one part of the ley be mixed with two parts of olive oil, in a\r\nglass or stone ware vessel, and the mixture be stirred, from time to\r\ntime, with a wooden spoon or spatula, it will become thick, and white;\r\nin seven or eight days afterwards the combination will be completed, and\r\na white and firm soap will be obtained.\r\n\r\n_White soap_ is formed of ingredients similar to those that have just\r\nbeen mentioned. _Yellow soap_ is made with tallow, resin, and soda. Soap\r\nmay be formed by boiling shreds of woollen cloth with ley till the whole\r\nhas acquired a certain consistence. This kind of soap has been made, and\r\napplied with success, in several manufactories in France.—The\r\ncombination of oil and other ingredients with potash (205), instead of\r\nsoda, affords what is called _soft soap_.\r\n\r\n201. _NATRON, or CARBONAT of SODA, is a salt which consists of soda\r\n(200) in combination with carbonic acid (26). It is massive, of greyish\r\ncolour, soluble in water, and has a disagreeable alkaline taste._\r\n\r\nThis salt is found in Egypt, on the surface of the earth, and\r\nparticularly near the margins of certain lakes called natron lakes. In\r\nthe summer season the water of these lakes is evaporated by the heat of\r\nthe sun, leaving a bed of natron generally about two feet in thickness.\r\nThis is broken with wedges and hammers; and packed up for sale in the\r\nEuropean markets. The waters of some of the lakes contain both common\r\nsalt and natron; and these, on evaporation, crystallize in successive\r\nbeds. Natron is found in considerable quantity under the form of an\r\nefflorescence, on the surface of the earth, in the plains of Debreczin\r\nin Hungary. It is likewise found in small quantity in the ashes of most\r\nvegetables, but particularly in those of _salsoda_ and _salicornia_.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians are said to have made great use of natron for the\r\npreservation of dead bodies, by macerating them in it for several months\r\npreviously to their being embalmed. Large quantities of this salt are\r\nsometimes imported into England, by the East India Company’s ships, from\r\nChina, and other parts of the East. It is employed in the manufacture of\r\nsoap, and for the washing of linen. Glass─makers mix it with sand for\r\nthe formation of glass. On the continent it is administered as a\r\nmedicine in complaints of the bowels and liver. The ancients sometimes\r\nemployed a mixture of natron for soaking their seed corn, under an\r\nimpression, that, when afterwards committed to the earth, it would\r\nthereby be rendered more fertile.\r\n\r\n202. _COMMON SALT, or MURIAT of SODA, though found in some countries in\r\na solid and massive state, is for the most part an artificial\r\npreparation from sea─water, and from the water of salt lakes and brine\r\nsprings. It consists of soda (200) in combination with muriatic acid\r\n(29)._\r\n\r\nFew productions, either natural or artificial, are in so much request as\r\ncommon salt. It is used by the inhabitants of nearly all countries, for\r\ncorrecting the insipidity of food. When applied in small quantities, it\r\naccelerates the putrid fermentation; and, in this case, is considered to\r\naid digestion, by promoting the decomposition of the aliments. In larger\r\nquantity it has a contrary effect, and tends to preserve organic\r\nsubstances from corruption. Salt is used for glazing the surface of\r\ncoarse earthenware; and is employed in several processes of dyeing.\r\n\r\nWhen this substance is dug out of the earth it has the appellation of\r\n_rock salt_: and immense masses of it are found in different countries\r\nof the world. The most considerable, as well as the most celebrated\r\n_salt mines_, with which we are acquainted, are those about five miles\r\nfrom Cracow, in Poland; and it is supposed that they contain more salt\r\nthan would be sufficient to supply the wants of the whole world for\r\nseveral thousand years. On descending to the bottom of these mines, a\r\nstranger is astonished to find a kind of subterraneous republic,\r\nconsisting of many families, who have their own peculiar laws and\r\npolity. Here are likewise public roads, and carriages, horses being\r\nemployed to draw the salt to the mouths of the mine, where it is taken\r\nup by engines. The horses, when once they are down, never more see the\r\nlight of day; and many of the people seem buried alive in this immense\r\nabyss. Some are born there, and never stir out; others, however, have\r\noccasional opportunities of breathing the fresh air in the fields, and\r\nenjoying the light of the sun. The subterraneous passages or galleries\r\nare very spacious; and, in many of them, chapels are hewn out of the\r\nsalt. In these are set up crucifixes, and the images of saints, before\r\nwhich lights are kept continually burning. In some parts of the mine\r\nhuge columns of salt are left standing to support the rock. Its windings\r\nare so numerous and intricate, that workmen have frequently lost their\r\nway: the lights they carried have been burned out, and they have\r\nperished before they could be found. The salt is taken from these mines\r\nin blocks so large as, sometimes, to measure nine feet in length, four\r\nfeet in width, and two or three feet in thickness. In the year 1780, the\r\ngreatest depth to which the workmen had penetrated was about 320 yards,\r\nand the mass of salt was considered to be in some places more than 240\r\nyards thick, and to extend at least three leagues.\r\n\r\nNear the town of Cardona, about fifty miles northwest of Barcelona, in\r\nSpain, there is a mountain of salt, without cleft or crevice, 500 feet\r\nhigh, and nearly three miles in circumference. In the province of\r\nLahore, in Hindostan, travellers have described a mountain of the same\r\nmineral, not inferior to this in magnitude; and the elevated regions of\r\nPeru afford rock salt at the height of 7000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nAt Northwich and Nantwich, in the county of Chester, there are salt\r\nmines of great depth and extent. These are frequently visited by\r\ntravellers, and are found amply to repay the trouble and inconvenience\r\nof descending into them. There are two principal beds of this substance;\r\nthe upper one is about forty─two yards below the surface, and twenty─six\r\nyards thick. This was originally discovered about a century and a half\r\nago, in searching for coal. The lower bed has already been examined to\r\nthe depth of forty yards, without coming to the bottom; and it is about\r\nthe centre of this bed that the purest salt has been discovered. The\r\naverage depth of the cavity, formed by the workmen along the vein of\r\nsalt in the different mines, is supposed to be about sixteen feet. In\r\nsome of the mines, where pillars six or eight yards square are left to\r\nsupport the roof, the appearance of the cavity is singularly beautiful:\r\nand the effect is greatly increased when the mine is illuminated by\r\nnumerous candles fixed to the side of the rock. The scene so formed\r\nwould almost seem to realize the notion of the magic palaces of Eastern\r\npoets. Some of the mines are worked in aisles or streets. The methods\r\nemployed in working out the salt offer nothing worthy of notice. Larger\r\nmasses are separated from the body of the rock, by blasting with\r\ngunpowder; and are afterwards broken down with pickaxes, hammers, and\r\nother instruments. The present number of mines in the vicinity of\r\nNorthwich is eleven or twelve, from which there are raised, on an\r\naverage, 50,000 or 60,000 tons of salt per annum. The greater part of\r\nthis quantity is exported to Ireland and the Baltic; and the remainder\r\nis employed in Cheshire, and the adjacent counties.\r\n\r\nSalt is also made from _brine springs_ in Cheshire, Cumberland,\r\nStaffordshire, and Worcestershire; but the kind most commonly used in\r\nEngland is that which is made from sea water, and has the name of _sea\r\nsalt_. The mode of manufacturing it is very simple. The water is first\r\npumped into shallow reservoirs of earth, called salt pans, or salterns.\r\nIn these it remains exposed to the sun until a certain proportion of the\r\nwater is evaporated, so as to leave it about seven times stronger than\r\nin its original state. It is then conducted by another pump into flat\r\niron pans, eight or nine feet square, and as many inches deep. These,\r\nbeing placed over a hot fire, the liquor or brine is boiled until nearly\r\nall the remaining particles of water have passed off by evaporation, and\r\nnothing is left in the pans but salt. This is thrown together into\r\nproper vessels, for a few days, to drain, after which it is fit for use.\r\n\r\nIn some countries the whole evaporation is performed by the heat of the\r\nsun; and, in extreme northern climates, where the sun would not have\r\nsufficient power for the operation, a very different process is adopted.\r\nThe water is suffered to freeze in the salterns, and that portion of it\r\nwhich continues uncongealed is so strongly saturated that it requires\r\nonly a moderate heat to evaporate the remainder of the water, and to\r\ncrystallize the salt.\r\n\r\n_Bay salt_ is that which is produced from the evaporation of sea─water\r\nby the heat of the sun only.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Cardona, in Spain, make of the rock salt in their\r\nneighbourhood various transparent articles, which they vend at a cheap\r\nrate. These, which consist of small altars, figures of saints, crosses,\r\nchandeliers, salt─cellars, &c. are as clear as crystal, and, to\r\nappearance, as lasting. They are chiefly purchased by strangers as\r\ncuriosities, and are distributed over various parts of Spain and the\r\nsouth of France.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition of salt furnishes the _muriatic acid_ (29), or _spirit\r\nof salt_ of commerce. This liquid, which is much used in the arts, and\r\nis in great request by chemists, is prepared, for common purposes, by\r\nmixing one part of common salt with seven or eight parts of clay, and\r\ndistilling the mixture; or by distilling common salt and spirit of\r\nvitriol or sulphuric acid (24), and receiving the product into a vessel\r\ncontaining water.\r\n\r\nIt has been discovered that muriatic acid, in a state of gas, is an\r\nexcellent means of correcting putrid exhalations. In the year 1773, the\r\ncathedral church of Dijon was so much infected by the corruption of\r\nbodies which had been interred within its walls, that it was entirely\r\ndeserted. The professor of Chemistry at Dijon having been applied to for\r\nassistance, placed, on a few burning coals, in the middle of the church,\r\na glass vessel containing six pounds of common salt. Upon this he poured\r\ntwo pounds of sulphuric acid (24), precipitately withdrew, and shut all\r\nthe doors. The gas soon filled the whole cathedral. After twelve hours\r\nthe doors were thrown open, and a current of air was made to pass\r\nthrough to remove the gas, which had entirely destroyed every putrid\r\nodour.\r\n\r\nThe following has been recommended as an eligible mode of fumigating\r\nrooms for the prevention of infectious disorders. Take six drachms of\r\npowdered nitre (206), and six drachms of sulphuric acid (spirit of\r\nvitriol); and mix them in a tea─cup, by adding to the nitre one drachm\r\nat a time of the oil. During the preparation the cup must be placed on a\r\npiece of heated iron, and the mixture stirred with a tobacco pipe or\r\npiece of glass. As soon as the fumes arise, the cup must be moved about\r\nto different parts of the room or house that are to be fumigated.\r\n\r\n203. _GLAUBER SALT, or SULPHAT of SODA, is a salt which consists of soda\r\n(200) in combination with sulphuric acid (24). It occurs in an\r\nefflorescent or powdery state, on the borders of salt lakes; or, more\r\ncommonly, in a state of solution, in certain mineral waters._\r\n\r\nThis salt, which was originally discovered by a German chemist whose\r\nname was Glauber, has a nauseously bitter and saline taste. It is found,\r\nin an efflorescent state, on meadow ground at Eger, in Bohemia; and on\r\nthe walls of old galleries in mines, at Grenoble, in France. It is also\r\nabundant in the ashes of some kinds of vegetables, especially of sea\r\nweeds. The waters of the Mediterranean yield a great proportion of it;\r\nand the Glauber salt used for commercial purposes is chiefly prepared\r\nfrom sea─water, or by decomposing common salt, in order to procure\r\nmuriatic acid (29). It may also be obtained by saturating soda with\r\nsulphuric acid (24).\r\n\r\nThe use of this salt in medicine is well known; and, in some countries,\r\nit is employed as a substitute for soda (200), in the manufacture of\r\nwhite glass. It ought to be kept in well─corked bottles, as otherwise\r\nthe crystals soon fall into powder.\r\n\r\nThe following is a pleasing experiment, which shows a singular and\r\nalmost instantaneous crystallization of Glauber’s salt. Dissolve this\r\nsalt by adding portions of it gradually to water kept boiling until the\r\nwater will dissolve no more. Pour the solution, whilst boiling, into\r\ncommon medicine phials previously warmed, and immediately cork them. Set\r\nthe phials in a quiet place without shaking them. The solution, when\r\ncool, will remain perfectly fluid till the cork is taken out; but the\r\nmoment this is done, and the air is admitted, it will begin to\r\ncrystallize on its upper surface, in fine satin─like crystals, which\r\nwill shoot downward, like a dense white cloud. In this act so much heat\r\nbecomes evolved as to make the phial feel sensibly warm to the hand.\r\nWhen the crystallization is complete, the whole mass generally becomes\r\nso solid, that, on inverting the bottle, not a drop of it will fall out.\r\nIf the crystallization should not immediately ensue on opening the\r\nphial, this may instantly be effected by dropping into it a minute\r\ncrystal of the same salt. The experiment may be exhibited any number of\r\ntimes afterwards, by merely placing the phial in boiling water, till the\r\nsalt it contains be again completely liquefied; and letting it stand, as\r\nbefore, to cool.\r\n\r\n204. _BORAX is a salt composed of boracic acid (28) and soda (200), and\r\nis imported chiefly from the East Indies, in the form of a brownish\r\ngrey, impure, shapeless salt, of sweetish taste; or in detached\r\nprismatic crystals, each about an inch in length._\r\n\r\nAlthough borax has long been known as an article of traffic, there is\r\nscarcely any production with the origin of which we have been, till\r\nlately, less acquainted. It is found in a native, though impure state,\r\nin a mountain lake, situated about fifteen days’ journey from the\r\ncapital of Thibet in the East Indies. This lake is so encompassed with\r\nhills as to have no stream either falling into it or flowing from it.\r\nThe water is salt to the taste, and contains both borax and common salt;\r\nand the edges and shallow parts are covered with a stratum of this\r\nsubstance, which is dug up in considerable masses for exportation. It\r\nhas here the name of _tinkal_, and is usually brought into Europe\r\nenveloped in a kind of fatty substance. The mode of refining it was for\r\na long time kept, by the Dutch and Venetians, amongst those secrets\r\nwhich a want of sufficient research alone prevented from being generally\r\nknown. When refined, it is called _borax_.\r\n\r\nThe uses of borax are numerous. It is employed as a flux for metals,\r\nbeing found to produce a more perfectly limpid fusion than any other\r\nsubstance. For the same reason it is made an ingredient in the finest\r\nkinds of glass, and particularly in some of the coloured glass pastes\r\nwhich are manufactured in imitation of gems. But its chief use is to\r\njewellers and goldsmiths, to facilitate the soldering of gold and\r\nsilver. Borax is also used in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          205. POTASH FAMILY.\r\n\r\nPotash is an alkaline substance (42), of white colour, and of smell\r\nsomewhat resembling that which is perceived during the slaking of\r\nquick─lime (137). It is extremely corrosive, and remarkably acrid to the\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nIn a mineral state it is found only in combination with nitric acid\r\n(30).\r\n\r\nPotash principally exists under the form of a salt, in vegetable\r\nsubstances; and is obtained by burning them, afterwards repeatedly\r\nwashing the ashes with water, and then filtering and evaporating these\r\nto dryness. The appellation of potash was given to this salt from its\r\nhaving formerly been prepared in large iron pots.\r\n\r\nThe uses to which it is applied are numerous. In chemistry it is\r\nemployed for a variety of purposes; and also in many arts and\r\nmanufactures, in scouring, washing, bleaching, dyeing, glass─making, and\r\nseveral others. Its corrosive property is such that it is often used by\r\nsurgeons under the name of _potential cautery_, to open abscesses, and\r\nto destroy useless or hurtful excrescences.\r\n\r\n=Potash=, after it has been made red hot, is rendered whiter and more\r\npure. In this state it has the name of pearl ash.\r\n\r\n206. _NITRE, or SALTPETRE, is a salt which consists of potash in\r\ncombination with nitric acid (30)._\r\n\r\n_Its colour is whitish or limpid; and it does not liquefy by the action\r\nof the air. It is usually observed in the form of fine capillary\r\ncrystals, though it is sometimes found in a massive state. When pure, it\r\ncrystallizes into six─sided prisms (Pl. II, Fig. 15) which have a\r\nrectangular base. It is denominated by chemists_ nitrat of potash.\r\n\r\nNitre is found incrusted on the surface of the earth, in some parts of\r\nIndia, Africa, and Spain, and, in such abundance, as to admit of being\r\nswept off at certain seasons of the year, twice or three times a week.\r\nIn our own country it not unfrequently occurs in a state of white\r\nefflorescence, on old plaster walls that are sheltered from rain. Nitre\r\nis also produced in stables and cart─houses, from the mixture of animal\r\nand vegetable substances in a state of putrescence.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of plants, which grow in soils favourable to the production\r\nof it, contain nitre: this is particularly the case with pellitory,\r\nborage, and the large sunflower.\r\n\r\nImmense quantities of nitre are annually required for the purposes of\r\nwar. From its constituting one of the most important substances in the\r\ncomposition of gunpowder, it has been found necessary to adopt\r\nartificial modes of procuring it. In several districts of the East\r\nIndies there are places called saltpetre grounds. From these large\r\nquantities of the earth are dug, and put into cavities through which\r\nwater is passed. This brings away with it the salt which the earth\r\ncontains, and which is afterwards separated from the water by boiling.\r\nThe East India Company, for more than a century past, has been under\r\nengagements to import into this country, and supply the board of\r\nordnance, for his Majesty’s service, with 500 tons of nitre annually, at\r\ngiven rates and prices in times of peace and war.\r\n\r\nIn France this article is obtained in what are called _nitrières_, or\r\nnitre beds. These consist of the refuse of animal and vegetable\r\nsubstances, which undergo putrefaction, mixed with calcareous and other\r\nearths; and the nitre is obtained from them by water, as\r\nabove─mentioned.—The principal requisites for the formation of nitre are\r\nsaid to be lime, animal and vegetable matters, heat, and an open, but\r\nnot too free communication with dry atmospheric air.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of _gunpowder_ has completely changed the modern art of\r\nwar. The earliest notice that has occurred respecting the use of this\r\narticle in Europe is, that it was employed in the wars of Germany,\r\nsomewhat before the year 1373. It is said, however, to have been known\r\nin China long anterior to that period. Its component parts are nitre,\r\ncharcoal, and sulphur, in the proportion of seventy─six, fifteen, and\r\nnine parts, in every hundred. These ingredients are first reduced to a\r\nfine powder separately, and then mixed with water, so as to form a thick\r\npaste. After this has dried a little, it is placed upon a kind of sieve\r\nfull of small holes, through which it is forced. By this process it is\r\ndivided into grains, the size of which depend of course upon the size of\r\nthe holes through which it has been squeezed. It afterwards undergoes\r\nsome other operations before it is ready for use.\r\n\r\nNitre is frequently administered in medicine; and it is used very\r\nextensively in different arts. A mixture of equal parts of nitre and\r\ntartar, burned together in a crucible, forms what is called _white\r\nflux_, which is used for melting and reducing different kinds of\r\nmetallic substances. And a mixture of one part of nitre and two parts of\r\ntartar burned in the same manner forms what is called _black flux_.\r\nNitre possesses antiseptic qualities in a considerable degree, whence it\r\nis much used, in conjunction with common salt and bay salt, for the\r\npreserving of animal food from putrefaction.\r\n\r\n_Aqua─fortis_, or _nitric acid_ (30) as it is denominated by chemists,\r\nis prepared from this mineral. The mode of obtaining it in large\r\nmanufactories is by distilling a mixture of nitre and clay in glass or\r\nstone retorts, each capable of containing seventy or eighty pounds’\r\nweight of this mixture. But the acid thus procured being weak and\r\nimpure, chemists, for nicer purposes, generally prepare it by\r\ndistilling, in a glass apparatus, a proportion of three parts of nitre\r\nand one of sulphuric acid (24). The uses of aqua─fortis are various and\r\nimportant. All kinds of metals, except gold and platina, are capable of\r\nbeing dissolved in it. Hence, among other uses, it is employed by dyers,\r\nfor dissolving tin, and forming with madder a scarlet colour; and, by\r\nhatters, for dissolving mercury (228) for some processes in the\r\npreparation of hats. Jewellers use it for several purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            AMMONIA FAMILY.\r\n\r\n207. _SAL─AMMONIAC, or MURIAT OF AMMONIA, is a salt compounded of\r\nammonia and muriatic acid (22). It is occasionally found in a state of\r\npowder, sometimes in a massive form, and sometimes in very irregularly\r\nshaped crystals, the primitive form of which is an octohedron (Pl II,\r\nFig. 5). It is, however, more frequently an artificial production from\r\nthe soot of burned animal matter._\r\n\r\nThe name of sal─ammoniac was acquired by this substance from its having\r\nbeen found by the ancients in great abundance amongst sand near the\r\ntemple of Jupiter Ammon, in Africa. It is at present found in Persia;\r\nand, accompanying sulphur, amongst volcanic matter near Mount Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nThis salt was formerly imported from Egypt in the form of conical\r\nloaves, or of round cakes, which were convex on one side and concave on\r\nthe other; but it is now made in Europe, by burning at the same time\r\nsoot, bones, oil, and salt. The deposit formed by the vapour consists of\r\nsal─ammoniac, in conjunction with other substances, which are separated\r\nfrom it by a subsequent process. When good, it is white, transparent,\r\nand dry within; and externally of yellowish grey, or blackish colour.\r\n\r\nSal─ammoniac is applied to many useful purposes. Occasionally it is used\r\nin medicine. A considerable portion of it is consumed by dyers, to give\r\nbrightness to some of their colours. It is also employed in the assay of\r\nmetals, to discover the presence of iron; and having the property of\r\nrendering lead brittle, is sometimes used in the manufacture of shot. By\r\ncoppersmiths and tinners it is used for cleansing the surface of the\r\nmetals which they are about to cover with tin. In certain manufactories\r\nsal─ammoniac is mixed with tobacco, to give that article, or the snuff\r\nthat is made from it, additional stimulant properties. Sal─ammoniac\r\ndissolved in nitric acid (30) forms the fluid named _aqua─regia_, which\r\nis employed in the solution of gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ORDER II.—METALLIC SALTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SALTS OF IRON.\r\n\r\n208. _GREEN VITRIOL, IRON VITRIOL, or COPPERAS, is a mineral salt formed\r\non a decomposition of pyrites (236) by the moisture of the atmosphere.\r\nIt is also called SULPHAT OF IRON._\r\n\r\n_Its colour is bright green, and its taste very astringent; a solution\r\nof it in water dropped on oak bark instantly produces a black spot._\r\n\r\nAlthough copperas is occasionally found in grottoes, caverns, the\r\ngalleries of mines, and other places; yet, being much in request by\r\ndyers, tanners, and the manufacturers of ink, it is artificially\r\nprepared from pyrites. This mineral being moistened and exposed to the\r\nair, a crust is formed upon it, which is afterwards dissolved in water;\r\nand from this the crystals of vitriol are obtained by evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe principal use of vitriol is in dyeing woollen articles, hats, and\r\nother manufactures, black. It is the basis of ink, and is used in the\r\nmanufacture of Prussian blue. If it be reduced to powder by the action\r\nof fire in a crucible, and mixed with powder of galls, it forms a dry\r\nportable ink. Sulphuric acid (24) may be obtained from this kind of\r\nvitriol by distillation. The residue, after the process is completed, is\r\nused as a red paint; and when washed, is employed for the polishing of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\n                            SALTS OF COPPER.\r\n\r\n209. _BLUE VITRIOL, or SULPHAT OF COPPER, is a blue salt formed by a\r\ncombination of copper with sulphuric acid (24)._\r\n\r\nThis substance, though sometimes found in a state of concretion, or in\r\nthe form of powder disseminated over the surface of stones that have\r\nbeen in contact with water impregnated with it, is more frequently an\r\nartificial preparation obtained from evaporating the water which runs\r\nthrough copper mines. In the mines of Neussol, in Hungary, at the depth\r\nof 380 feet beneath the surface of the ground, are several vats, placed\r\nat different distances, for the purpose of collecting the water\r\nimpregnated with copper, and which flows into them through a kind of\r\ngallery above. From this water the vitriol is afterwards separated by\r\nevaporation. A process somewhat similar is pursued in our own country.\r\n\r\nIn the principal blue vitriol manufactories established in France, the\r\noperation is thus carried on. Pieces of copper are first dipped into\r\nwater, and their surface, while wet, is covered with a stratum of\r\npowdered sulphur. The copper thus prepared is put into an oven, and\r\nheated to redness. After some time, it is taken out, and, while hot, is\r\nplunged into a vessel filled with water. These operations are repeated\r\nseveral times, till the whole of the copper is dissolved, and the water\r\nbecomes loaded with vitriol. Thus saturated, the water is placed over a\r\nfire till all the fluid particles are dissipated, and the vitriol alone\r\nis left.\r\n\r\nBlue vitriol is used by artists and manufacturers in various ways. It is\r\nemployed in dyeing: and enters into the composition of black colours, to\r\nwhich it gives depth and solidity. Blue feathers are stained by plunging\r\nthem into a hot solution of it. The beautiful grass─green colour of the\r\nshops, called _mineral green_, is made from blue vitriol; and\r\nfowling─pieces and tea─urns are browned by washing them with a\r\npreparation of it.\r\n\r\n                             SALTS OF ZINC.\r\n\r\n210. _WHITE VITRIOL, or SULPHAT OF ZINC, is a whitish, yellowish, or\r\ngreenish white salt, formed by a combination of zinc (241) with\r\nsulphuric acid (24)._\r\n\r\nAlthough the white vitriol that is used in commerce is chiefly an\r\nartificial preparation, this salt sometimes occurs in a natural state,\r\nin mineral repositories that contain blende (241); and it appears to be\r\nformed by a decomposition of that ore. It is found at Holywell, in\r\nFlintshire, and in some parts of Cornwall.\r\n\r\nWhen white vitriol is artificially prepared, the blende is roasted, and\r\nthrown, while red hot, into a vessel filled with water; in which it is\r\nallowed to remain about eighteen hours. This process is repeated several\r\ntimes; and, after the solution has become clear, it is removed into\r\nleaden vessels, and the water is evaporated by means of heat. On\r\ncooling, it crystallizes. After this the crystals are melted in a copper\r\nvessel, and the surface of the solution is skimmed with a hair sieve. It\r\nis then poured into a wooden vessel, and stirred till it becomes cool,\r\nand acquires a sufficient degree of consistence, when it is formed into\r\nloaves for sale. In this state it has the appearance and colour of\r\nrefined sugar. White vitriol is chiefly manufactured in Germany.\r\n\r\nIt is used in medicine; and is employed in great quantities by\r\nvarnishers, to make their oil varnishes dry more readily than they\r\notherwise would. A fine white colour, called _zinc─white_, which is more\r\ndurable than white lead, is prepared from it. Dyers use a considerable\r\nquantity of white vitriol to render deeper the colours produced by\r\nmadder, cochineal, and other substances.\r\n\r\nA pleasing experiment is made by mixing in a phial a small quantity of\r\nsolution of white vitriol with a little liquid ammonia. Though each of\r\nthe fluids is transparent when separate, yet the zinc will now be\r\nimmediately precipitated in a white mass; and, what is peculiarly\r\ndeserving of remark, if then shaken, it will almost as instantly be\r\nre─dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CLASS III.—COMBUSTIBLES.\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SULPHUR FAMILY.\r\n\r\n211. _COMMON SULPHUR, or BRIMSTONE, is a yellow, dry, and brittle\r\nsubstance, which, in burning, yields a suffocating fume: the smell of\r\nthis, under the denomination of_ sulphureous, _is well known._\r\n\r\n_Sulphur is found in a pure or native state in nearly all volcanic\r\ncountries: it is about twice as heavy as water; and is sometimes\r\ncrystallized in the form of octohedrons, whose bases are rhombs. It\r\nexists abundantly in a state of combination with several metallic\r\nsubstances, and is also formed in putrid animal remains._\r\n\r\nA great proportion of the sulphur which is used in commerce is obtained\r\nby the process of roasting copper, and other ores, previously to their\r\nbeing smelted. It passes off in the form of vapour, and, on being\r\nreceived into chambers constructed for the purpose, is there deposited\r\nin a powdery state. The substance thus formed is the _flour of sulphur_\r\nof the shops. It is afterwards melted in large pans, and cast in wooden\r\ntubes, to make the hard, or _roll brimstone_. Nearly all the sulphur\r\nused in France comes from the Solfatara of Italy. This volcanic country\r\nevery where exhibits indications of the agency of subterraneous fires.\r\nNearly the whole ground is bare and white; and, in every part, is warmer\r\nthan the atmosphere during the greatest heat of summer. A sulphureous\r\nvapour is constantly emitted from the earth, and sulphur is condensed in\r\nvarious parts, and in great abundance. This is collected, packed in\r\ncasks, and exported to Marseilles, where it undergoes certain\r\npreparations that are necessary towards purifying and rendering it fit\r\nfor sale.\r\n\r\nA considerable quantity of sulphur is employed in the composition of\r\ngunpowder (206). Its readiness of taking fire is the reason of its being\r\nemployed in the making of matches. Sulphur gives a blue colour to\r\nartificial fire─works. Its vapour is used for the whitening of silk and\r\nwool, and also for the bleaching of straw used for making ladies’ hats.\r\n\r\nModellers employ sulphur to make moulds for various kinds of casts; and\r\nartists are enabled, by means of it, to take sharp and beautiful\r\nimpressions of medals and engraved stones. The mode of doing this is\r\nvery simple. The sulphur is put into an earthen vessel called a\r\ncrucible, and placed on a hot fire. It soon melts; and if kept some time\r\nover the fire, becomes thick and dark─coloured. When poured into water\r\nin this state, it is as soft as wax. It may now be easily worked between\r\nthe fingers into any given form: and, if pressed upon a seal or engraved\r\nstone, will be found to retain a perfect impression of it. It is this\r\nproperty of sulphur of which Mr. Tassie, of Leicester─fields, London,\r\nhas availed himself, to furnish extremely elegant impressions of many\r\nantique gems.\r\n\r\nSulphur was much used by the ancients in medicine; and it is now\r\noccasionally administered both as an external and internal remedy. The\r\ncompounds formed from it are employed to considerable extent in various\r\nprocesses of dyeing and calico printing. Many of the mineral waters,\r\nthose, for instance, of Harrowgate (299) and Moffat (300), are indebted\r\nto sulphur for their most valuable qualities.\r\n\r\nThis substance has the property of becoming electric by rubbing. On\r\nexposure to a gentle heat, it melts; but if the heat be increased, it is\r\nentirely consumed, and passes off in vapour. When ignited, and the\r\ncombustion is slow, it burns with a suffocating and acid fume, and blue\r\nflame; but when the combustion is quick it burns with a white and vivid\r\nflame. If exposed to a sudden, though gentle heat, by holding it, for\r\ninstance, in a hand when that is warm, it will sometimes break in pieces\r\nwith a crackling noise.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable circumstance, that, if a bar of iron be heated to\r\nperfect whiteness, and then touched with a roll of sulphur, the two\r\nbodies combine, and drop down together, in a fluid state, forming what\r\nis called _sulphuret of iron_, a compound of the same nature as iron\r\npyrites (236). A piece of iron rolled out very thin may be apparently\r\nmelted in the hand, by putting it, when heated to whiteness, upon a\r\nthick piece of solid sulphur. It is, however, necessary, that this\r\nexperiment be performed with great care; and under a chimney, or in a\r\nplace where there is a current of air, to carry off the suffocating\r\nvapour.\r\n\r\nUseful as sulphur is, in various ways, its most important application is\r\nsupposed to be for the production of _sulphuric acid_, or _spirit of\r\nvitriol_ (24). One mode in which this acid is obtained for the purposes\r\nof commerce, is by burning a mixture of sulphur and nitre (206) in large\r\nchambers lined with lead. In this process the nitre supplies a\r\nconsiderable portion of oxygen (21) to the sulphur, and the air of the\r\natmosphere furnishes the rest. Thus a substance which, in a natural\r\nstate, is one of the mildest that we are acquainted with, is by this\r\noperation converted into a corrosive and dangerous, though useful fluid.\r\nIts taste is strongly acid: and, when applied to animal or vegetable\r\nsubstances, it soon corrodes, and destroys their texture.\r\n\r\nThe properties of sulphuric acid have rendered it extremely valuable for\r\nnumerous purposes, both in the arts and in the laboratory. It has been\r\nlong employed by chemists, as one of their most useful and frequent\r\nagents.\r\n\r\nThe fluid that is put into the bottles for procuring _instantaneous\r\nlight_ is no other than sulphuric acid; and it is poured among filaments\r\nof asbestos (which it will not corrode), for the same purpose as ink is\r\nsometimes poured upon cotton. The matches are slips of wood dipped in a\r\nmixture of equal weights of sugar or charcoal powder, and what the\r\nchemists call hyperoxy─muriat of potash. These are to be rubbed together\r\nin a mortar, but with great care, as by strong friction the mixture is\r\napt to explode. To obtain a light, nothing farther is requisite than to\r\ndip a match, thus formed, into a bottle containing the acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BITUMEN FAMILY.\r\n\r\n212. _NAPHTHA, or ROCK OIL, is a yellow or brownish bituminous fluid, of\r\nstrong penetrating odour, somewhat greasy to the touch, and so light as\r\nto float even on spirit of wine._\r\n\r\n_By exposure to the air, the consistence of naphtha is increased, and it\r\npasses into petroleum (213)._\r\n\r\nThere are copious springs of naphtha at Baku, on the shore of the\r\nCaspian Sea; and also in some parts of Italy, particularly at\r\nMonte─Chiaro, near Piacenza. At Pitchford, in Shropshire, extensive\r\nstrata or beds of sandstone are saturated with this mineral fluid, which\r\nis obtained from the stone by distillation, and is sold, as a remedy\r\nagainst sprains and rheumatism, under the name of _Betton’s British\r\noil_.\r\n\r\nBy the Persians and Russians naphtha is used internally as a cordial. On\r\nthe shores of the Caspian it is burned in lamps, instead of oil; and, in\r\nsome parts of Italy it is employed in the lighting of churches and\r\nstreets. When mixed with certain vegetable oils, it forms an excellent\r\nvarnish.\r\n\r\nIt is the property of naphtha to take fire on the approach of a light,\r\nand to burn with great readiness and a white flame, leaving scarcely any\r\nresiduum. The town of Broseley, in Shropshire, was formerly celebrated\r\nfor a _burning spring_, which was first discovered in the month of June,\r\n1711. Its original issuing from the ground was announced by a terrible\r\nnoise in the night, which awakened several persons who lived near the\r\nspot. Some of these, on going out to ascertain the cause of the alarm,\r\nperceived, about two hundred yards from the river Severn, an\r\nextraordinary shaking of the earth, and a little bubbling of water\r\nthrough the grass. On digging round the spot, the water sprang up to a\r\ngreat height, and a candle which one of them held in his hand, set it on\r\nfire. This circumstance excited great curiosity; and many persons, from\r\ndifferent parts of the adjacent country, came to visit what was called\r\nthe “burning well.” To prevent this spring from being destroyed, an iron\r\ncistern was placed upon it, with a small hole in the cover, through\r\nwhich the water might be viewed. When a lighted candle was put into this\r\nhole, the water immediately took fire, darting and flashing in a violent\r\nmanner, much in the same way as spirits do in a lamp, but with greater\r\nagitation. It would sometimes burn for forty─eight hours successively,\r\nand without any sensible diminution: and a tea─kettle, full of water, by\r\nbeing placed upon the hole, has been made to boil in nine minutes. In\r\n1747, this spring had been lost for many years; but another was shortly\r\nafterwards discovered, the issuing of which was announced by a rumbling\r\nnoise under ground, similar to that which had been formerly heard. This,\r\nhowever, also disappeared in the year 1756, by the sinking of a coal─pit\r\nin the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n213. _PETROLEUM, or MINERAL OIL, is a fluid bitumen, of somewhat greater\r\nconsistency than naphtha: of black, brown, or sometimes dingy green\r\ncolour._\r\n\r\n_By exposure to the air it assumes the consistence of tar, and is then\r\ncalled MINERAL TAR (214)._\r\n\r\nThis substance exudes spontaneously from the earth, or from clefts of\r\nrocks, and is found in nearly all countries, particularly in the East\r\nIndies, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and England. In the neighbourhood\r\nof Rangoon, in Pegu, there are several hundred wells of petroleum. These\r\nare of square form, of considerable depth, and each lined with cassia\r\nwood staves. The oil is drawn from them pure, and in a liquid state, and\r\nis conveyed thence in small jars. The whole annual produce of this\r\ndistrict is estimated at more than 400,000 hogsheads.\r\n\r\nAt Colebrook Dale, in Shropshire, there is a spring of petroleum. This\r\nwas discovered at the depth of about thirty yards beneath the surface of\r\nthe earth, in digging an archway for the conveying of coals from a very\r\ndeep pit. The petroleum was at first found to ooze from between the\r\ncrannies of the rock, but it soon afterwards poured forth in a\r\nconsiderable stream. The utility of this fluid having been made known,\r\nlarge iron pipes were formed from the spring into pits sunk for the\r\npurpose of receiving it. From these pits it is conveyed into immense\r\ncaldrons, where it is boiled until it attains the consistency of pitch.\r\nSince the first discovery of this substance, three different springs of\r\nit have broken out. One of these is near the celebrated iron bridge; and\r\nthe fluid that issues from it is almost pellucid, but, at the same time,\r\nis thicker than treacle.\r\n\r\nPetroleum easily takes fire, and, in burning, yields a strong, sharp,\r\nand somewhat unpleasant odour; and a thick and disagreeable smoke. In\r\ncold weather it congeals in the open air.\r\n\r\nIn Pegu, and other parts of the East, petroleum is used in place of oil\r\nfor lamps. Boiled with a species of resin, it is employed for painting\r\nthe timber of houses, and covering the bottoms of boats and other\r\nvessels. In the latter respect it is considered to be particularly\r\nefficacious, by protecting the timber from the attacks of marine worms.\r\nIt is also used by the inhabitants of eastern countries as a lotion in\r\ncutaneous eruptions, and as an embrocation in bruises and rheumatic\r\naffections. The ancient Egyptians used it in the embalming of dead\r\nbodies. In some countries lumps of earth are soaked with petroleum, and\r\nare employed as fuel.\r\n\r\n214. _MINERAL TAR, or BARBADOES TAR, is a fluid kind of bitumen,\r\nsomewhat thicker than petroleum, and nearly of the consistence of common\r\ntar. It is viscid, of a black, brownish black, or reddish colour._\r\n\r\n_In burning its smell is disagreeable, but less pungent than that of\r\nmost other kinds of bitumen. Its weight is somewhat greater than that of\r\nwater._\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies, where this substance is principally found, it is\r\napplied to many of the purposes for which the preceding species is used;\r\nbut its principal repute has been obtained from its being thought useful\r\nin disorders of the breast and lungs, though this application of it is\r\nconsidered very improper. It is likewise used as an external remedy in\r\nparalytic disorders.\r\n\r\n215. _ELASTIC BITUMEN, or MINERAL CAOUT─CHOUC, has a strong resemblance\r\nto Indian rubber. In some instances it is elastic, and so soft as to\r\nadhere to the fingers, and in others brittle, and so hard as nearly to\r\nresemble asphalt (216)._\r\n\r\n_Its colour is yellowish, reddish brown, or blackish. One kind of this\r\nmineral, when fresh cut, nearly resembles fine cork, both in texture and\r\ncolour._\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary substance, which will expunge the marks of black lead\r\nin the same manner as Indian rubber, was first discovered, about the\r\nyear 1786, in cavities of the lead mine of Odin, near Castleton, in\r\nDerbyshire, and it has not hitherto been found elsewhere. Elastic\r\nbitumen appears to be a peculiar modification of petroleum, in its\r\npassage to asphalt: and probably owes its elasticity to its cellular\r\ntexture, and to the moisture with which it is combined.\r\n\r\n216. _ASPHALT, or SOLID BITUMEN, is a brittle substance, of black or\r\nbrownish black colour, and of consistence somewhat harder than pitch._\r\n\r\n_It has nearly the same weight as water, is smooth to the touch, does\r\nnot stain the fingers, and has little or no smell unless it be rubbed or\r\nheated. When heated, it melts, swells and inflames; and, if pure, burns\r\nwithout leaving any ashes._\r\n\r\nThe ancients were well acquainted with this substance, which is nothing\r\nmore than mineral tar (214) in an indurated or hardened state. It is\r\nfound on the surface of volcanic productions, and floats, in solid\r\npieces, and in considerable abundance, on the Asphaltic Lake, in Syria,\r\nwhich has thence received its name. This lake is also called the Dead\r\nSea, from a notion that the odour arising from the asphalt destroys even\r\nbirds which fly over it: Maundrell, however, states that this is not\r\ntrue, as he saw several birds fly about and over it, without\r\nexperiencing the slightest injury.\r\n\r\nAsphalt is also found near ancient Babylon; and there is reason to\r\nsuppose that the mortar so celebrated amongst the ancients, and with\r\nwhich the walls of Babylon and of the Temple of Solomon were cemented,\r\nwas nothing more than a preparation of asphalt. We are informed by\r\nHerodotus that a composition of heated bitumen, mixed with the tops of\r\nreeds, was used by the ancients as a cement. This account is confirmed\r\nby modern travellers, who assert that the remains of buildings have been\r\ndiscovered in which bitumen was formerly thus employed. It is presumed\r\nto be the same substance which, in our translation of the Old Testament,\r\nis called pitch, and which was used by Noah, as an exterior and interior\r\ncoating of the ark; by the mother of Moses as a coating for the little\r\nvessel in which he was exposed; and on various other occasions.\r\n\r\nAs an article of modern utility, it is to be remarked that the Arabians\r\ndissolve asphalt in oil, and, with the mixture, smear their horse\r\nharness, to preserve it from the effects of weather, and the attacks of\r\ninsects. In a state of solution it is applied, in several eastern\r\ncountries, as a covering for timber and the bottoms of ships. It is\r\noccasionally used in the cleansing and healing of ulcers, and other\r\nsores. In France it is manufactured into a substance which is in\r\nconsiderable request for greasing the wheels of carriages. It is used by\r\nthe makers of watch─dials, who mix it with lamp black, and oil of\r\nturpentine; but its chief use is as an ingredient in certain varnishes,\r\nand particularly in the varnish used by copper─plate engravers. It is\r\nfrequently adulterated by a mixture with common pitch; but this is\r\neasily discovered by the smell.\r\n\r\nBesides the countries and places already mentioned, asphalt is found in\r\nseveral parts of America, in the island of Trinidad, in the province of\r\nNeufchatel, and many parts of the Continent of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COAL FAMILY.\r\n\r\n217. The component parts of coals are principally carbon or charcoal\r\n(48), and bitumen (216).\r\n\r\nSome kinds of coal are laminar, and others compact. They in general burn\r\nfreely, with a bituminous odour, and leave a considerable residuum.\r\n\r\nThis invaluable mineral is found in beds, or strata, frequently betwixt\r\nclay slate (257) and sandstone (267), and seldom betwixt those of\r\nlimestone (140). It chiefly occurs in the northern hemisphere,\r\nparticularly in countries which lie nearly in the same latitudes with\r\nGreat Britain; in Siberia, Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and\r\nNewfoundland; and in some of the northern parts of China. It is stated\r\nto be abundant in New Holland; but we have no distinct account of coal\r\nin the continent of Africa. No fewer than seventy different kinds of\r\ncoals are brought to the London market, the value and prices of which\r\ngreatly differ. Of these the coals called _Wall’s─end_, from the name of\r\nthe pit, near Newcastle, whence they are obtained, usually bear the\r\nhighest price.\r\n\r\n218. _COMMON COAL, or PIT COAL, is of black colour, and has generally a\r\nslaty structure and foliated texture._\r\n\r\n_When handled it stains the fingers; and when burnt it cakes more or\r\nless during combustion. Its component parts are usually charcoal (48)\r\nand bitumen (216), with a small portion of clay, and sometimes with\r\npyrites, or sulphat of iron (236). What is called slaty coal contains a\r\ngreater portion of clay than other kinds._\r\n\r\nSome foreign writers have ascribed the great wealth possessed by this\r\ncountry to the coals which are here produced in such abundance, and\r\nwhich facilitate, in a very essential degree, nearly all its\r\nmanufactures, and consequently are a means of promoting its commerce to\r\nan extent which is possessed by few other countries. All our great\r\nmanufacturing towns, Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Glasgow, &c. are\r\nsituated either in the midst of coal districts, or in places to which\r\ncoals are conveyed, with little expense, by canal carriage.\r\n\r\nCoals are principally obtained from the neighbourhood of\r\nNewcastle─upon─Tyne, Sunderland, and Whitehaven. The particular places\r\nwhence they are obtained have the name of _collieries_, and the mines\r\nfrom which they are dug are called _pits_. The deepest of these are in\r\nNorthumberland, and are worked at more than 900 feet below the surface\r\nof the earth. At Newcastle there is a coal─pit near 800 feet in depth,\r\nand which, at that depth, is wrought five miles horizontally, quite\r\nacross, and beneath the bed of the river Tyne, and under the adjacent\r\npart of the county of Durham. At Whitehaven the mines are of great\r\ndepth, and are extended even under the sea, to places where there is\r\nabove them sufficient depth of water for ships of great burthen, and in\r\nwhich the miners are able sometimes to hear the roaring of the water. On\r\nthe contrary, in some parts of Durham the coal lies so near the surface\r\nof the earth that the wheels of carriages lay it open, and in such\r\nquantity as to be sufficient for the use of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe beds of coal are of various thicknesses, from a few inches to\r\nseveral feet; and in some places, it is found advantageous to work them\r\nat a very great depth, although their thickness does not exceed four or\r\nfive feet. The thickest bed of English coal, of any extent, is that of\r\nthe main coal in Staffordshire, which measures about thirty feet. In\r\nmany places there are several beds above, and parallel to, each other,\r\nseparated by strata of slate, sandstone, and other minerals. Coal is\r\nnever found in chalk, and very rarely in limestone.\r\n\r\nAt Whitehaven, the principal entrance to the coalmine, both for men and\r\nhorses, is by an opening at the bottom of a hill, through a long passage\r\nhewn in a rock. This, by a steep descent, leads to the lowest bed of\r\ncoal. The greatest part of the descent is through spacious galleries,\r\nwhich intersect other galleries; all the coal having been cut away,\r\nexcept large pillars, which, in deep parts of the mine, are three yards\r\nhigh, and about twelve yards square at the base, such great strength\r\nbeing there required to support the ponderous roof. There are three\r\ndistinct and parallel strata of coal, which lie at a considerable\r\ndistance above each other, and which have a communication by pits that\r\nare sunk between them. These strata are not always regularly continued\r\nin the same plane. The miners occasionally meet with veins of hard rock,\r\nwhich interrupt their further progress, and, at such places, the earth,\r\non one side of the vein, appears to have sunk down, while that on the\r\nopposite side has its ancient situation. These breaks the miners call\r\n_dykes_ (4). When they come to one of them, their first care is to\r\ndiscover whether the coal, in the part adjoining, be higher or lower\r\nthan that in which they have been working; or, to use their own terms,\r\nwhether it be cast down or cast up. For this purpose they examine\r\nattentively the mineral strata on the opposite side, to see how far they\r\ncorrespond with those which they have already passed through. If the\r\ncoal be cast down, they sink a pit to it: but if it be cast up, the\r\ndiscovery of it is often attended with great labour and expense.\r\n\r\nIn general the entrance to coal mines is by perpendicular shafts, and\r\nthe coals and workmen are drawn up by machinery. As the mines frequently\r\nextend to great distances, horizontally, beneath the surface of the\r\nearth, peculiar care is necessary to keep them continually ventilated\r\nwith currents of fresh air, for the purpose, not only of affording to\r\nthe workmen a constant supply of that vital fluid, but also to expel\r\nfrom the mines certain noxious exhalations which are sometimes produced\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nOne of these, denominated _fire damp_, is occasioned by the generation\r\nof hydrogen gas, or inflammable air (45). This gas, when mixed with the\r\ncommon air of the atmosphere, explodes, with great violence, on the\r\napproach of a lighted candle, or any other flame; and has, at different\r\ntimes, occasioned the loss of many valuable lives. It is a singular\r\ncircumstance, that although it is immediately set on fire by a flame,\r\nyet it cannot be kindled by red hot iron, nor by sparks produced from\r\nthe collision of flint and steel. Hence a machine was, some years ago,\r\nadopted in the mines near Whitehaven and Workington, in which a wheel\r\nformed of steel, and in shape somewhat like that of a razor─grinder, was\r\nturned round with very rapid motion against a series of flints, and in\r\nsuch manner as to yield to the miners sufficient light to carry on their\r\nwork in places where the flame of a candle would occasion the most\r\ndreadful explosions. Sir Humphrey Davy has lately invented, for the use\r\nof mines where this gas is prevalent, what is called a _safety lamp_.\r\nThis is a lamp enclosed in a wire cylinder, the interstices of which are\r\nso extremely small as, whilst it gives light, will not explode the gas.\r\n\r\nAnother injurious exhalation in coal mines arises from the formation of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, or fixed air (26), and is called _choke damp_. It is\r\nthe property of inflammable air to rise to the upper parts; but this, on\r\naccount of its weight, occupies principally the lower parts of mines,\r\nand occasions death by suffocation, though it is by no means so fatal as\r\nthe former. In some mines a prevention of injury arising from each of\r\nthese gases is attained, by ascertaining the particular crevices in the\r\ncoal from which they issue, confining them at those places within a\r\nnarrow space, and, if possible, conveying them out of the mines, through\r\nlong pipes, into the open air.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another danger attending coal mines which requires to be\r\nprovided against, and this is inundation. Many mines have been destroyed\r\nby the flooding of water, which springs up within them. The modes by\r\nwhich this was formerly extracted were extremely laborious, and, in\r\nnumerous instances, entirely inefficacious. By means, however, of the\r\nfire or steam engines now in use, the quantity of water raised from\r\nmines is perfectly astonishing. Four engines in one of the collieries at\r\nWhitehaven discharge more than twenty hogsheads per minute, or upwards\r\nof 30,000 hogsheads in every twenty─four hours.\r\n\r\nThe coal trade, which at present affords so important a nursery for our\r\nseamen, and, in numerous other respects, yields advantages of the most\r\nbeneficial description to this country, was entirely unknown a few\r\ncenturies ago. Coals were not generally adopted as fuel until the\r\nbeginning of the reign of Charles I. They were, however, noticed in\r\ndocuments anterior to the reign of Henry III., for, that monarch, in the\r\nyear 1234, renewed a charter, granted by his father, to the inhabitants\r\nof Newcastle, by which they were permitted to dig coal upon payment of\r\n100_l._ per annum. Coals had been introduced into London before 1306;\r\nfor in that year, the use of them as fuel was prohibited, from the\r\nsupposed tendency of their smoke to corrupt the air. About the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century, the best coals were sold in London at the rate\r\nof 4_s._ 1_d._ per chaldron, and at Newcastle for no more than 2_s._\r\n6_d._ During the ensuing century, however, they were received into such\r\ngeneral use, that, in 1648, on a scarcity of coal in London, many of the\r\npoor are said to have died from want of fuel. The whole quantity of\r\ncoals imported into London has been estimated, on an average of four\r\nyears, ending in March, 1815, to amount to 1,170,000 chaldrons per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nSome writers have imagined coal to be the remains of antediluvian\r\ntimber, which floated upon the waters of the deluge until several strata\r\nof mineral substances had been formed: others conceive it to have been\r\nantediluvian peat bog. It is called _pit coal_, from the circumstance\r\nonly of its being obtained from mines or pits; and, in London, for no\r\nbetter reason than its having been conveyed thither by sea, it has the\r\nname of _sea coal_.\r\n\r\nIts uses as fuel are too extensively known to need here any\r\nobservations. By the distillation of coal an inflammable gas is\r\nproduced, which has of late been introduced for the lighting of\r\nmanufactories, and lighting several of the streets and shops of the\r\nmetropolis. This gas is conveyed by pipes, from the reservoir in which\r\nit is collected, to great distances; and the light which it yields is\r\npeculiarly brilliant and beautiful. It was at the foundery belonging to\r\nMessrs. Boulton and Watts, at Birmingham, that the first public display\r\nof _gas lights_ was made, in the year 1802, on the occasion of the\r\nrejoicings for peace. In 1805 the cotton mills of Messrs. Phillips and\r\nLee, at Manchester, were lighted with gas, to the exclusion of lamps,\r\ncandles, and every other source of artificial light. In the beginning of\r\n1816 it was estimated that, at the three gas─light stations, in\r\nPeter─street, Westminster, Worship─street, and Norton Falgate, London,\r\ntwenty─five chaldrons of coals were used daily; and that these were\r\nsufficient to supply with gas 125,000 large lamps. At the works in\r\nDorset─street, Fleet─street, the daily consumption of coal was about\r\nthree chaldrons, which afforded gas for 1,500 lamps.\r\n\r\nThe production of the _gas light_ is easily effected in miniature, by\r\nputting common coal, pounded small, into the bowl of a tobacco─pipe, and\r\nclosely covering this with clay made into a stiff lute with water. When\r\nthe clay is dry, the bowl of the pipe must be put into the fire, and\r\nthere heated gradually. In a few minutes a stream of gas will issue from\r\nthe end of the pipe. This may be set on fire with a piece of paper, and\r\nwill burn with a bright flame. When the gas is no longer disengaged,\r\nthere will be found in the bowl of the pipe the remains of the coals, in\r\nthe form of coke.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that one chaldron of good coals will afford from 17,000,\r\nto 20,000 cubical feet of gas; and that one of the large burners in the\r\nshops of London, consumes about four cubical feet per hour.\r\n\r\n_Soot_ is produced from the smoke of burned coal, and is used as a\r\nmanure for cold, moist, and clayey meadows and pastures: and pounded\r\ncoal has been applied to the same purpose in some parts of the\r\nContinent. By a process called charring, coal is divested of its humid,\r\nacid, and bituminous particles, and is converted into a kind of cinder\r\ncalled _coke_. This is employed in cases where intense heat is\r\nrequisite, as for the smelting of iron ore; and likewise where acid and\r\nbituminous particles of coal would be detrimental, as in the drying of\r\nmalt.\r\n\r\nWhat is usually termed _culm_ is the refuse or dusty coal, produced in\r\nworking the common coals. It contains much earthy matter, will not\r\nkindle in an ordinary fire─place, but produces considerable heat and\r\nflame in a furnace, where a strong current of air is introduced. In\r\nEngland it is exempted from the high duty imposed on other coals, and is\r\nsold at a very low price. It is used for burning lime, making salt, and\r\nin steam engines.\r\n\r\n219. _CANNEL COAL is of black colour, with little lustre, is not\r\nlaminar, but breaks in any direction, like pitch, and does not stain the\r\nfingers._\r\n\r\nThis highly inflammable kind of coal is found abundantly in the\r\nneighbourhood of Wigan, in Lancashire, where there is an entire stratum\r\nof it about four feet in thickness. It is also found near Whitehaven, in\r\nsome of the pits at Newcastle, and in some parts of Scotland. Doubts\r\nhave been entertained respecting the name of this coal; but when it is\r\nrecollected that in Lancashire, whence it is chiefly brought, the word\r\ncandle is usually pronounced with the omission of the letter _d_, and\r\nthat, in many instances, the coal is used by the poor as a substitute\r\nfor candles, these will be immediately removed. In Scotland it has the\r\nname of _parrot coal_.\r\n\r\nNo kind of coal takes fire so readily, nor burns with so cheerful and\r\nbrilliant a flame as this: and its not soiling the fingers, like pit\r\ncoal, renders the use of it peculiarly pleasant; but it does not cake,\r\nand soon burns away. When first kindled, it crackles and splinters very\r\nmuch; and, on this account, would be dangerous, were it not easily\r\nprevented from so doing by being previously immersed for a little while\r\nin water. Cannel coal has much the appearance of jet. It admits of being\r\nturned in a lathe, and takes a good polish; and snuff─boxes and trinkets\r\nmade of it have in many instances been sold as jet (222). Of all the\r\nkinds of coal that are used for gas─lights, none are said to be so\r\nuseful as this.\r\n\r\n220. _STONE COAL, KILKENNY COAL, WELSH COAL, or GLANCE COAL, is of a\r\ndark iron─black colour, with a metallic lustre and foliated texture; and\r\nconsists almost entirely of charcoal._\r\n\r\nUnlike most other kinds of coal, this occurs both in stratified masses,\r\nand in lumps, nested in clay. It is found in several countries of the\r\nContinent, in Wales, Scotland, and near Kilkenny in Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhen laid on burning coals, it becomes red hot, emits a blue lambent\r\nflame in the same manner as charcoal; and is, at length, slowly\r\nconsumed, leaving behind a portion of red ashes. No smoke nor soot is\r\nproduced from this coal; but, on the contrary, it whitens the places\r\nwhere the fume is condensed; and the effluvia which it gives out are\r\nextremely suffocating.\r\n\r\nThis coal is chiefly used in the drying of malt.\r\n\r\n221. _BOVEY COAL, BROWN COAL, or BITUMINOUS WOOD, is of brown colour,\r\nand in shape exactly resembles the stems and branches of trees, but is\r\nusually compressed. It is soft, somewhat flexible, and so light as\r\nnearly to float when thrown into water._\r\n\r\nThe greatest abundance of this coal occurs at Bovey, near Exeter, from\r\nwhich place it derives its name. The lowest stratum is worked at the\r\ndepth of seventy─five feet beneath the surface of the earth. It is also\r\nfound in Scotland, Ireland, and Germany.\r\n\r\nAs fuel, the Bovey coal is used only by the poorest classes of the\r\ncommunity, as, notwithstanding its burning with a clear flame, it emits\r\na sweetish but extremely disagreeable sulphureous gas, which is\r\ninjurious to the health of the inhabitants. It is principally used for\r\nthe burning of lime, and for the first baking of earthen ware.\r\n\r\n222. _JET, or PITCH COAL, is a solid, black, and opaque mineral, harder\r\nthan coal, and found in detached_ _masses from an inch to seven or eight\r\nfeet in length, having a fine or regular structure, and a grain\r\nresembling that of wood._\r\n\r\n_It has sometimes been confounded with cannel coal (219), but it is\r\neasily distinguished by its superior hardness: Jet cannot without\r\ndifficulty be scratched with a knife, whilst cannel coal may be marked\r\nby the simple pressure of the nail._\r\n\r\nThe name of jet has been derived from Gages, a river of Lycia, whence\r\nthe ancients are said to have obtained this substance. It is frequently\r\ncast ashore on the eastern coasts of England, together with pieces of\r\namber and curious pebbles, particularly near Lowestoft in Suffolk, and\r\nin some parts of Yorkshire, where many persons employ their leisure in\r\nsearching for it, and forming it into various kinds of trinkets. Jet is\r\nfound in several countries of the Continent.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that in the district of Aude, in France, there are more\r\nthan 1,000 persons constantly employed in the fabrication of jet into\r\nrosaries, buttons, ear─rings, necklaces, bracelets, snuff─boxes, and\r\ntrinkets of different kinds. Near fifty tons weight of it are annually\r\nused for this purpose; and articles to the value of 18,000 livres are\r\nsaid to be sold in Spain alone. In Prussia the amber diggers call it\r\n_black amber_, because it is found accompanying that substance; and\r\nbecause, like amber, it is faintly electric, or attracts feathers and\r\nother light objects when rubbed. They manufacture it into various\r\nornamental articles, and sell these to ignorant persons, as black amber,\r\nat a great price.\r\n\r\nIn different parts of the globe the trunks of trees, which have been\r\nlong buried, have passed into the state of jet; and, in almost all these\r\ntrees may be traced the distinctive characters of the species to which\r\nthey belong. They are more or less brittle, more or less unctuous,\r\naccording to the species, the degree of alteration, and the nature of\r\nthe soil. All of them have a smooth and glassy fracture, but all are not\r\nadapted for the tool of the workman. When, for instance, the texture of\r\nthe tree presents only a mass of dry fibres, the jet obtained is dry and\r\nbrittle; and cannot be used in the forming of trinkets. But, if the\r\ntexture be unctuous the fibre acquires a considerable degree of\r\nsoftness, is susceptible of being properly wrought, and receives a\r\nperfect and beautiful polish.\r\n\r\nA fictitious kind of jet is made of glass; and several varieties of\r\nmineral pitch, and cannel coal, are imposed upon ignorant purchasers for\r\njet.\r\n\r\nWhen jet is once set on fire it burns with a green flame, and continues\r\nto burn for a considerable time, exhaling a strong bituminous smell. If\r\nthe heat be rendered greater, it melts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GRAPHITE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n223. _BLACK LEAD, or PLUMBAGO, is an inflammable mineral, which consists\r\nof carbon, or charcoal (48), combined with iron, in the proportion of\r\nabout nine parts of the former to one of the latter._\r\n\r\n_It is of dark iron─grey colour, with a strong metallic lustre, and so\r\nsoft that it is easily scratched with a knife. To the touch it is soft\r\nand greasy; and, when handled, it stains the fingers. In weight it is\r\nabout twice as heavy as water._\r\n\r\nThe name of black lead has very improperly been given to this substance\r\nfrom its appearance only, as it has no alliance whatever with lead. It\r\nis usually found in kidney─shaped lumps of various size, and occurs in\r\nseveral countries of Europe, but no where of such excellent quality as\r\nin Borrowdale, Cumberland, where it has the name of _wadd_. The vein of\r\nblack lead lies between strata of slate, and is from eight to nine feet\r\nthick. This mine is not opened more than once every three or four years,\r\nthe quantity thus obtained being found fully sufficient for the demand.\r\nThe only other mine of black lead in Britain is in Ayrshire, Scotland.\r\n\r\nArtists in water─colours, if deprived of this mineral, would find great\r\ndifficulty in making their sketches; as the marks that are erroneously\r\nmade with it are more easily expunged than those of almost any other\r\nsubstance. Hundreds of thousands of pencils are every year formed of\r\nblack lead. For this purpose the mineral is sawed into slender square\r\npieces. These are fixed into grooves, of the same shape, cut in cedar,\r\nor some other soft wood; another piece of wood is then glued upon this,\r\nand the whole is worked into a circular form. The finer kinds of black\r\nlead are prepared for use by being boiled in oil before they are cut.\r\nThe coarser kinds, and the refuse of the sawings, are melted with\r\nsulphur, and then cast into coarser pencils for carpenters. These may,\r\nin general, be easily distinguished by their sulphureous smell. The\r\npencils that are manufactured in England are more esteemed on the\r\nContinent than any others.\r\n\r\nThe powder produced in the sawing of pencils is employed for numerous\r\npurposes. It is used for giving a bright gloss to cast─iron grates and\r\nstoves, and defending them from rust, and from the action of fire. It\r\nmay also be advantageously applied to the inner surface of wooden\r\nscrews, to packing presses, the axles of various sorts of machines, to\r\nslides, and other wood work, which are subject to friction. In this\r\nrespect it is far superior either to grease or soap. The makers of\r\nrazor─strops occasionally employ black lead in the composition which\r\nthey spread upon leather for the sharpening of razors; and, on the\r\nContinent, it is sometimes used for blackening the hair. A coarser kind\r\nof black lead is used for making the vessels that are used by chemists,\r\ncalled crucibles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             RESIN FAMILY.\r\n\r\n224. _AMBER is a substance usually of golden yellow colour,\r\nsemi─transparent, and of shining and somewhat resinous lustre. It is\r\noccasionally seen of yellowish white colour, and nearly opaque._\r\n\r\nThe origin of amber is unknown. From the ants and other insects which it\r\nfrequently contains, there can be no doubt that it has once been in a\r\nfluid state: and some writers have thought that it is a resinous juice,\r\ngradually modified by the action of sulphuric acid (24); but this is\r\nentirely conjecture. The ancients called it _electron_, and attributed\r\nits formation to the sisters of Phaëton, who, lamenting the death of\r\ntheir brother, were converted into poplar trees; these, it was said,\r\ninstead of tears, yielded every year this substance; which, issuing from\r\nthem in a fluid state, ran into the river, and there became hardened.\r\n\r\nAmber is usually found in rounded and detached pieces, on the south\r\ncoast of the Baltic, on the eastern shores of England, and in small\r\nquantity, on those of Sicily and the Adriatic; and a substance greatly\r\nresembling it is occasionally found in gravel pits near London. The only\r\nmines of amber at present known are in Prussia. These are worked in the\r\nusual way, by shafts and galleries, to the depth of about 100 feet. The\r\namber is imbedded in a stratum of fossil wood, and occurs in rounded\r\npieces, from a few grains to three and even five pounds in weight. The\r\nlargest piece of amber ever known to be discovered in a detached state\r\nwas found near the surface of the ground, in Lithuania, about twelve\r\nmiles from the Baltic Sea. It weighed more than eighteen pounds, and was\r\ndeposited in the cabinet of the King of Prussia at Berlin. Very lately a\r\nmass of amber, weighing thirteen pounds, was also found in Prussia. For\r\nthis piece 5000 dollars are said to have been offered; but the Armenian\r\nmerchants assert that it might have been sold in Constantinople for more\r\nthan 30,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nAnterior to the discovery or general dispersion of precious stones from\r\nIndia, amber was considered of great value as a jewel, and was employed\r\nin all kinds of ornamental dresses. The ancient Romans were so partial\r\nto this substance that Pliny, reprobating the great demand for it, says,\r\nthe Roman females would give larger sums for a puppet or figure in\r\namber, resembling a man or woman, however small its size, than they\r\nwould for the finest man or the most valiant soldier. Under the Emperor\r\nNero, persons were sent from Rome, for the purpose of collecting and\r\npurchasing amber; and so much of it was at length obtained, that it was\r\nused for ornamenting the nets and cordage employed in the theatres for\r\npreventing the wild animals from approaching the populace there\r\nassembled. It was likewise used to ornament the armour, the biers, and\r\nfuneral apparatus of such persons as were killed.\r\n\r\nAmber is now chiefly in request by Greek and Armenian merchants, but it\r\nis uncertain where they dispose of it. Some persons conjecture that it\r\nis purchased by pilgrims previously to their journey to Mecca; and that,\r\non their arrival in that place, they burn it in honour of Mahomet.\r\n\r\nThe kind most in esteem is of a bright golden yellow colour. This is\r\noccasionally manufactured into snuff─boxes, small vases, necklaces,\r\nbracelets, cane─heads, and other ornamental articles, many of which are\r\npurchased by the Turks, Russians, and Poles; but the general demand for\r\nthem has of late very much decreased. Some years ago the German artists\r\npaid great attention to this substance; and many experiments were made\r\nfor the purpose of discovering means of removing its defects, and\r\nimproving its beauty. It is said that they possessed the art of\r\nliquefying it to such a degree, that it could be run into moulds without\r\ninjuring its beauty; and that specimens of this liquefied amber are\r\npreserved in the Electoral Cabinet at Dresden. There are still\r\nconsiderable manufactories of amber at Stolpen, Konigsberg, Dantzic, and\r\nLubeck.\r\n\r\nAmber, when wrought into ornaments, is first split on a leaden plate,\r\nand then turned on a particular kind of whetstone. The polishing of it\r\nis performed with chalk and water, or chalk and oil; and the work is\r\nfinished by rubbing the whole with clean flannel. Without great\r\nattention it becomes very hot, and either flies into pieces, or takes\r\nfire during the operation.\r\n\r\nAfter having been roasted or melted, amber is readily soluble in oil,\r\nand, in this state, constitutes the basis of several kinds of varnish.\r\nIt was formerly much used in medicine, but, in this respect, it is now\r\nalmost wholly neglected. Some persons, however, have still an absurd\r\nnotion that a collar or necklace of amber, tied round an infant’s neck,\r\nwill enable it to cut its teeth in safety. Oil of amber combined with\r\nliquid ammonia constitutes a white soapy liquor called _eau─de─luce_.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that insects are occasionally found in\r\namber. These are generally in a very perfect state, and consist of\r\nflies, small moths, &c. Grains of sand, pieces of iron pyrites, and the\r\nleaves of plants, are also sometimes found in it. Insects, sand, and\r\nother substances, are likewise remarked in a species of gum, called _gum\r\nanimè_, which, in colour, appearance, and qualities, so nearly resembles\r\namber, that it is almost impossible to distinguish the two substances\r\nfrom each other. Large productions, which were formerly supposed to have\r\nbeen made of amber, such as a column ten feet high in the Florentine\r\nMuseum, are now usually considered to have been formed of this gum; and\r\nmany of the large beads of what are sold as amber necklaces are made of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIf a piece of amber be fixed on the point of a knife and lighted, it\r\nwill burn entirely away, emitting at the same time a white smoke, and a\r\nsomewhat agreeable though sickly odour. When rubbed it has the property\r\nof attracting light bodies; hence one of the ancient Greek philosophers\r\nattributed to it a certain kind of life. From the name of _electron_,\r\nwhich was given to it by them, in consequence of this property, we\r\nderive our word electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CLASS IV.–METALLIC SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n                         OF METALS IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n225. METALS, in a perfect state, are easily distinguished from other\r\nminerals, by a peculiar brilliancy which pervades their whole substance,\r\nand which has the name of _metallic lustre_; by their complete opacity,\r\nand their great weight in proportion to that of other mineral\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nWhen taken from the earth they are found in one or other of the four\r\nfollowing states: 1. In a native or metallic state, 2. Combined with\r\nsulphur, 3. In a state of oxide (21) 4. Combined with acid.\r\n\r\nMetals, when found in a state of combination with other substances, have\r\nthe name of _ores_. They are in general deposited in veins (4), of\r\nvarious thickness, and at various depths in the earth. The mode of\r\nobtaining them is to penetrate from the surface of the earth to the\r\nvein, and there to follow it, in whatever direction it may lie. The\r\nhollow places thus formed are called _mines_, and the men employed in\r\nthem are denominated _miners_. When the veins are at a great depth, or\r\nextend to any considerable distance beneath the surface of the earth, it\r\nis necessary, at intervals, to make openings, or _shafts_, to the\r\nsurface, for the admission and circulation of the air; and also to draw\r\noff the water which collects at the bottom, by drains, pumps, or\r\nsteam─engines, as the situation or circumstances require.\r\n\r\nAfter the metallic ores are drawn from the mine, they, in general, go\r\nthrough several processes before they are in a state fit for use. Some\r\nof them are first washed in running water, to clear them from earthy\r\nparticles. They are then piled with combustible substances, and burnt or\r\nroasted, for the purpose of ridding them of the sulphur or arsenic with\r\nwhich they may happen to be combined, and which rises from them in a\r\nstate of fume or smoke. Thus, having been freed from impurities, they\r\nundergo the operation of melting, in furnaces constructed according to\r\nthe nature of the respective metals, or the uses to which they are to be\r\nsubsequently applied.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of metals is a subject of great importance to mankind.\r\nTheir use in trade is so frequent, and in the arts so various and so\r\ninteresting, that few objects can be more worthy of attention than\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ORDER I.—MALLEABLE METALS;\r\n\r\n\r\nOR, SUCH AS ARE CAPABLE OF BEING FLATTENED OR ELONGATED BY THE HAMMER,\r\nWITHOUT TEARING OR BREAKING.\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n226. _PLATINA, the most ponderous of all the metals with which we are\r\nacquainted, is, when purified, about twenty times heavier than water. It\r\nis also one of the hardest and most difficult to be melted, is of white\r\ncolour, but darker and not so bright as silver, and is found only in\r\nsmall blunted and angular grains or scales in the sands of some of the\r\nrivers in South America._\r\n\r\nIf platina could be obtained in sufficient quantity, it would perhaps be\r\nthe most valuable of all metals. The important uses to which it is\r\napplicable may easily be imagined when we state that it is nearly as\r\nhard as iron, and that the most intense fire and most powerful acids\r\nhave scarcely any effect upon it. Platina is not fusible by the heat of\r\na forge, but requires either the concentrated rays of the sun in a\r\nburning mirror, the galvanic electricity, or a flame produced by the\r\nagency of oxygen gas.\r\n\r\nIt is admirably adapted for the uses of the philosophical chemist:\r\nalthough vessels made of it must always be found expensive, from its\r\nbeing necessary to solder them with gold; and although it has the\r\ndisadvantage of being subject to corrosion by the application or use of\r\ncaustic alkalies. Vessels made of it are not liable to be broken, and\r\nare as indestructible as those made of gold. When properly refined, its\r\ncolour is somewhat betwixt that of silver and iron. Not being liable to\r\ntarnish like silver, platina is manufactured into several kinds of\r\ntrinkets.\r\n\r\nIts ductility is so great that it may be rolled into plates, or drawn\r\ninto wire; and platina wire, for strength and tenacity, is considered\r\nmuch preferable to that either of gold or silver of equal thickness.\r\nPlatina is also made into mirrors for reflecting telescopes, into\r\nmathematical instruments, pendulums, and clock─work; particularly where\r\nit is requisite that the construction of these should be more than\r\nusually correct, as platina is not only free from liability to rust, but\r\nis likewise subject to very little dilatation by heat. It is sometimes\r\nbeaten into leaves and applied to porcelain, in the same manner as leaf\r\ngold; and its oxide (21) is used in enamel painting, and might be used,\r\nwith great advantage, in the painting and ornamenting of porcelain. The\r\nplatina employed for all these purposes is repeatedly melted with\r\narsenic, as without the aid of this it could only be obtained in very\r\nsmall masses, owing to the intense heat that is required for its fusion.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary metal was unknown in Europe until about the year\r\n1735, when it was first brought from South America by Don Antonio Ulloa.\r\n\r\n227. _GOLD is a metal distinguished by its yellow colour; by its being\r\nnext in weight to platina, softer than silver, but considerably more\r\nhard than tin; and being more easily melted than copper._\r\n\r\n_It is found in various states, massive, in grains, small_ _scales, and\r\ncapillary, or in small branches. It cannot be dissolved in any acid\r\nexcept that called aqua regia (207), and is more than nineteen times\r\nheavier than water._\r\n\r\nThe countries of hot climates are those chiefly in which gold is\r\ndiscovered. It abounds in the sands of many African rivers, and is very\r\ncommon in several districts both of South America and India. The gold\r\nmines of Lima and Peru have had great celebrity; but, since the late\r\ncommotions in the Spanish colonies, the working of them has been much\r\nneglected. It is from Brazil that the greatest part of the gold which is\r\nseen in commerce is brought. The annual produce of the various gold\r\nmines in America has been estimated at nearly 9,500,000_l._ sterling.\r\n\r\nThe principal gold mines in Europe are those of Hungary, and next to\r\nthem those of Saltzburg. Spain is probably very rich in gold.\r\nConsiderable mines were worked there in former times, particularly in\r\nthe province of Asturia; but, after the discovery of America, these were\r\ngiven up or lost. Gold has been found in Sweden and Norway, and also in\r\nseveral parts of Ireland, but particularly in the county of\r\nWicklow.—Among the sands of a mountain stream in that county, and among\r\nthe sand of the valley on each side, lumps of gold are occasionally\r\nfound. Pieces have been discovered which weighed twenty─two ounces, but\r\nthey are generally much smaller, from two or three ounces to a few\r\ngrains. It is said that lumps of gold, of large size, have been used as\r\nweights in some of the common shops, and that others have been placed to\r\nkeep open the doors of cottages and houses in some parts of Ireland, the\r\nowners not knowing what they were. Gold is also occasionally found in\r\nCornwall, and some other counties of England. Wherever it occurs it is\r\ncommonly observed in a state of alloy with copper or silver, and in the\r\nform of grains, plates, or small crystals.\r\n\r\nGold was formerly obtained in Scotland. It is asserted that, at the\r\nmarriage of James V. there were covered dishes filled with coins made of\r\nScottish gold, and that a portion of these was presented to each of the\r\nguests by way of dessert. Very extensive operations for the discovery of\r\ngold were carried on during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, at Leadhills,\r\nin Lanarkshire, under the direction of an Englishman whose name was\r\nBulmer. The trenches, the heaps of soil that were turned up, and other\r\nmarks of these operations, are yet visible near the road between\r\nLeadhills and Elvanfoot. It is said that 300 men were then employed; and\r\nthat, in the course of a few years, a quantity of gold was collected,\r\nequal in value to 100,000_l._ sterling. Not many years ago similar\r\noperations were commenced under the superintendence of a celebrated\r\nmanager of the Scottish lead mines. The gold was found immediately under\r\nthe vegetable soil; and the method of obtaining it was to direct a small\r\nstream of water, so as to carry the soil along with it, to basins or\r\nhollow places, where the water might deposit the matters carried down by\r\nthe force of its current. The matter thus deposited was repeatedly\r\nwashed, till the whole of the earthy substances were carried off. The\r\ngold, being heaviest, sunk to the bottom, and remained behind. The soil\r\nstill furnishes gold; but the produce would by no means be equal to the\r\nexpense of collecting it. Searching for gold, therefore, is now regarded\r\nonly as an amusement, and not as a source of profit. Grains of this\r\nmetal are sometimes found, after great floods, among the sand of brooks\r\nin different parts of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe mode of extracting gold from its ore is by reducing it into a fine\r\npowder, and mixing this powder with quicksilver (228). The latter having\r\nthe quality of uniting with itself every particle of the precious metal,\r\nbut being incapable of union with the other substances, extracts it even\r\nfrom the largest portions of earth. The quicksilver, which has absorbed\r\nthe gold, is then separated by means of heat; it flies off in vapour,\r\nand leaves the other metal in the vessel used for the operation.\r\n\r\nGold has been known, and in request, from the very earliest ages of the\r\nworld. By the assent of civilized nations, it has become the\r\nrepresentative of wealth under the form of money; and it is now an\r\nuniversal circulating medium for the purchase of all kinds of\r\ncommodities. It has been chosen to occupy this important place on\r\naccount of its scarcity, its weight, and other valuable properties.\r\n\r\nAs gold is not liable to tarnish or rust, it is frequently employed for\r\nornaments of dress. But, beyond its use in the coinage, its most\r\nimportant uses are for goldsmith’s work, in jewellery, and for gilding.\r\nIn each of these its standard or purity is different. That denominated\r\n_coinage_, or _sterling gold_, consists of an alloy of about twenty─two\r\nparts of gold with two parts of copper; whilst gold of the _new\r\nstandard_, of which gold plate, watch─cases, and many other articles are\r\nmade, consists of only eighteen parts of gold, and six parts of copper.\r\nEach of these is stamped at Goldsmiths’ Hall; the former with a lion, a\r\nleopard’s head (the mark of the goldsmith’s company), a letter denoting\r\nthe year, the king’s head, and the manufacturer’s initials; the latter\r\nis stamped with the king’s head, letter for the year, a crown, the\r\nnumber 18 to designate its quality, and the manufacturers initials. The\r\ncoinage gold of Portugal and America is of the same standard as our own;\r\nthat of France is somewhat inferior; and Spanish gold is inferior to the\r\nFrench. The Dutch ducats and some of the Moorish coins are of gold\r\nunalloyed. _Trinket gold_, which is unstamped, is in general much less\r\npure than any of the above; and the _pale gold_ which is used by\r\njewellers is an alloy of gold with silver.\r\n\r\nThe ductility and tenacity of this metal, particularly when alloyed with\r\ncopper, are extremely remarkable, and are fully proved by the great\r\nextent to which a very small quantity of it may be beaten into leaves,\r\nor drawn into wire. Leaves of gold may be beaten so thin, that a single\r\ngrain may be made into fifty─six leaves, each an inch square. These\r\nleaves are only 1/282000 of an inch thick; and the gold leaf which is\r\nused to cover silver wire is but the twelfth part of that thickness. An\r\nounce of gold upon silver wire is capable of being extended more than\r\n1,300 miles in length: and sixteen ounces of gold, which, in the form of\r\na cube, would not measure more than an inch and a quarter on each side,\r\nwill completely gild a silver wire in length sufficient to compass the\r\nwhole earth like a hoop.\r\n\r\nGold is beaten into leaves upon a smooth block of marble, fitted into\r\nthe middle of a wooden frame about two feet square, in such manner that\r\nthe surfaces of the marble and of the frame are exactly level. On three\r\nof the sides there is a high ledge; and the front, which is open, has a\r\nflap of leather attached to it, which the man who beats the gold uses as\r\nan apron for preserving the fragments that fall off. In this process\r\nthere are three kinds of animal membranes used, some of which are laid\r\nbetween the leaves to prevent their uniting together, and others over\r\nthem to defend them from being injured by the hammer. The exterior cover\r\nis of parchment. For interlaying with the gold, the smoothest and\r\nclosest vellum that can be procured is first used; and, when the gold\r\nbecomes thinner, this is exchanged for much finer skin, made of the\r\nentrails of oxen, prepared for this express purpose, and hence called\r\n_gold beater’s skin_. After the leaf has been beaten to a sufficient\r\ndegree of thinness, it is taken up by a cane instrument, and thrown flat\r\nupon a leathern cushion, where it is cut to a proper size with a square\r\nframe of cane, or wood edged with cane. These pieces are then fitted\r\ninto books of twenty─five leaves each, the paper of which has been well\r\nsmoothed, and rubbed with red bole (127), to prevent them from sticking.\r\nThe leaves are about three inches square, and the gold of each book\r\nweighs somewhat more than four grains and a half.\r\n\r\nIt was anciently the custom to beat gold into thin plates, and to gild\r\nthe walls of apartments, the surfaces of dishes, drinking utensils, and\r\nother articles, by covering them with such. But this was not only an\r\nexpensive, but it must have been a most clumsy mode of ornament. The\r\npresent modes of gilding are very different. When wood is to be gilded,\r\nthe surface is first smeared with an adhesive kind of oil, or with a\r\nkind of glue called size; and the gold leaf, above mentioned, is then\r\nspread upon it by a tuft of cotton or other soft substance.\r\n\r\nThe _gilding of iron or copper_ is performed by cleaning and polishing\r\nits surface, and then heating it till it has a blue colour. When this\r\nhas been done, a layer of gold leaf is put on, slightly burnished down,\r\nand exposed to a gentle fire. It is usual, in common work, to place\r\nthree such layers, or four at the most, each consisting of a single\r\nleaf. The heating is repeated at each layer, and last of all the work is\r\nburnished. For gilding in _or moulu_, as it is denominated by the\r\nFrench, an amalgam consisting of ten parts of mercury and one part of\r\ngold is used. This is spread upon the metal, and is afterwards exposed\r\nto the action of a fire sufficiently strong to evaporate the mercury and\r\nleave the gold behind. The gilding in _or moulu_ is much more solid and\r\npermanent than that by the former method.\r\n\r\nWhen gilding is pale and dirty, it may be revived by means of what is\r\ncalled _gilding wax_, a composition of yellow wax, bole (127), verdigris\r\n(230), and alum.\r\n\r\nA very beautiful gilding upon metals, and particularly upon silver, is\r\neffected by soaking clean linen rags in a solution of gold made by aqua\r\nregia (207). The rags are dried and burnt; and the ashes are carefully\r\npreserved. These ashes are used by taking a sound cork, moistening it\r\nwith a little water, dipping it into the ashes, and then rubbing\r\nstrongly a portion of them on the surface of the silver, which should be\r\nperfectly clean and bright. By this simple and economical process, it\r\nwill be covered with an extremely thin coating of gold, the colour and\r\nbrilliancy of which may be heightened by burnishing. The ornaments upon\r\nsnuff─boxes, fans, and various kinds of trinkets, are merely thin plates\r\nof silver, gilded in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe _edges of tea─cups_, and other similar articles, may be gilded,\r\nthough not in a very durable manner, by applying a thin coat of amber\r\nvarnish (224), and then placing leaf─gold upon it. When the varnish is\r\ndry, the gold is to be burnished.\r\n\r\nGold, in a state of solution, is sometimes used for staining marble,\r\nivory, ornamental feathers, and other articles, a purple─red colour,\r\nwhich cannot be effaced. By chemical processes an oxide (21) is obtained\r\nfrom this metal, which is employed for giving those beautiful shades of\r\nlilac, rose colour, red and purple, which we observe in glass and\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nA _gold powder for painting_ may be made by uniting one part of gold\r\nwith eight parts of mercury (228), and afterwards evaporating the latter\r\nby heat.\r\n\r\nThe article denominated _gold wire_ is generally silver wire gilded,\r\nvery little wire being made entirely of gold. Its uses are chiefly for\r\nembroidery and filagree work. _Gold thread_ consists of flatted silver\r\ngilt wire, laid over a thread of yellow silk, by twisting it in a\r\nmachine with iron bobbins. It is of this, and not of gold, that the\r\narticle called _gold lace_ is made. The Chinese, instead of flatted\r\nwire, use slips of gilt paper, which they interweave in their stuffs,\r\nand twist upon silk threads.\r\n\r\n228. _MERCURY, in its native state, is called quicksilver, and is found\r\nin small globules of shining, silvery appearance, scattered through\r\ndifferent kinds of stones, clay, and ores. It is nearly fourteen times\r\nheavier than water._\r\n\r\n_The principal ore of mercury, and that from which the metal is chiefly\r\nobtained, is_ cinnabar. _This is of red colour, and consists of mercury\r\nmineralized with sulphur. It is sometimes found in a massive state,\r\nsometimes in grains, and sometimes crystallized; and chiefly among rocks\r\nof the coal formation._\r\n\r\nThe most productive mines of cinnabar are in the palatinate of Germany,\r\nat Idria in Carniola, and at Almaden in Spain. Those of Idria are\r\nsupposed to be more valuable than any of the others. Their first\r\ndiscovery, which was somewhat more than three hundred years ago, was\r\nmade in a very extraordinary manner. This part of the country was then\r\nmuch inhabited by coopers; and one of the men, on retiring from work in\r\nthe evening, placed a new tub under a dropping spring, to try if it\r\nwould hold water; and, when he came in the morning, he found it so heavy\r\nthat he could scarcely move it. Examining into the cause of this\r\nextraordinary circumstance, the man observed that it was owing to a\r\nshining and ponderous fluid which was at the bottom. The affair was\r\nnoised abroad, and a society of persons was formed to search further,\r\nand discover the mine from which this quicksilver had flowed. Such was\r\ntheir success that the reigning Duke of Austria paid them a compensation\r\nfor the discovery, and took the mine into his own possession. The\r\ngreatest perpendicular depth of this mine is now more than 830 feet. It\r\nis descended by buckets, or by ladders placed obliquely in a zigzag\r\ndirection. In some parts of the mine the pure metal flows in small\r\nstreams, so that in six hours a man has been known to collect more than\r\nthirty─six pounds weight of it. In other parts it is found in a\r\nmultitude of little drops, either in ores or in clay. The whole produce\r\nof the mine is said to exceed a hundred tons weight of mercury per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that, several years ago, in digging out clay for\r\nthe foundation of a house opposite to the King’s Arms inn, in the street\r\ncalled Hyde─hill, in Berwick─upon─Tweed, a quantity of native mercury\r\nwas discovered. The clay, when dug out, lay for some time in the place\r\nto which it was conveyed; and the mercury was observed to exude from the\r\nsmall fissures or cracks that were formed as it dried. It is said that,\r\nseveral years afterwards, in making some alteration in the yard of the\r\nsame house, the workmen penetrated into the same bed of clay; and that\r\nit then appeared to be impregnated with native mercury, which ran out in\r\nsmall globules.\r\n\r\nMercury is sometimes imported into Europe from Peru, and from the East\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nThe mode of extracting it from _cinnabar_ is said to be by mixing this\r\nore either with pounded chalk, or with half its weight of iron filings,\r\nand distilling it in a stoneware retort. By this process the sulphur\r\ncombines with the iron, and the mercury, in a state of purity, passes\r\ninto the receiver.\r\n\r\nWhen pure or native mercury occurs in mixture with other substances,\r\nthese are stamped or ground into a coarse powder. Water is poured upon\r\nthem; they are briskly stirred until the water becomes thick and turbid,\r\nand then are left to settle. This operation is repeated till the water\r\nruns off perfectly clear. The substance at the bottom, which is\r\nprincipally mercury, is then put into large iron retorts and the metal\r\nis obtained, free from all extraneous matters, by distillation.\r\n\r\nIt is the singular property of this metal, which has no other alliance\r\nwhatever with silver than its appearance, to be capable of division, by\r\nthe least effort, into an indefinite number of particles, each of which\r\nassumes a spherical form; and to be always in a fluid state in the\r\ncommon temperature of our atmosphere. Even during the most intense\r\nfrost, it still retains its fluidity. By the effect, however, of extreme\r\ncold artificially produced, mercury becomes a solid metal, and in this\r\nstate may be beaten with a hammer and extended without breaking; but\r\ncare must be taken that it does not touch the fingers, as it would\r\nblister them and cause unpleasant sores, in the same manner as any\r\nburning substance.\r\n\r\nMercury has been known from the remotest ages; and it was employed by\r\nthe ancients in gilding, and in the operations of separating gold and\r\nsilver from their ores, in the same manner as at present. Being the\r\nheaviest of all fluids of which we have any knowledge, and not\r\ncongealing in the temperature of our climate, it has been preferred,\r\nbefore all others, for barometers, as a measure of the weight of the\r\natmosphere. And, as heat dilates mercury similarly to other fluids, it\r\nis likewise made into thermometers. Mercury is sometimes used in\r\nmedicine in its pure metallic state.\r\n\r\nThe combinations of mercury with other metals are termed _amalgams_.\r\nThat of mercury and gold is formed so readily, that if gold be dipped\r\ninto mercury, its surface immediately becomes as white as silver. An\r\namalgam of mercury and gold is employed for the gilding, and of mercury\r\nand silver for the silvering of metals.\r\n\r\nMercury and tin combined together form the substance that is used for\r\nthe _silvering of looking─glasses_. The process is as follows: A\r\nquantity of tin─foil, equal in size to the glass, is evenly placed on a\r\nflat stone or table; and mercury, in which some tin has been dissolved,\r\nis poured upon it, and spread with a feather, or bunch of cloth, until\r\nits union has covered every part. A plate of glass is then cautiously\r\nslided upon it, from one end to the other, in such manner that part of\r\nthe redundant mercury is driven off, or swept away before its edge. The\r\nremainder is now united to the tin. The glass is then loaded with\r\nweights all over, so as to press out still more of the mercury. By\r\ninclining the table, this remaining mercury becomes discharged; and, in\r\na few hours, the rest of the tin─foil and mercury adhere so firmly to\r\nthe glass, that the weight may be removed without any danger of its\r\nfalling. About two ounces of mercury are requisite for covering, in this\r\nmanner, three square feet of glass.\r\n\r\nBy means of mercury a _fulminating powder_ is made, which, when struck\r\nwith a hammer on an anvil or flat iron, such as is used by laundresses,\r\nexplodes with a stunning and disagreeable report, and with such force as\r\nto indent both the anvil and the hammer. Four or five grains are as much\r\nof this powder as ought to be used for such experiments. Its force is\r\nmuch greater than that of gunpowder, but does not extend so far. Hence\r\nit is a substance which might be rendered of great use in the blasting\r\nof rocks.\r\n\r\n_Corrosive sublimate_ is an extremely poisonous preparation from\r\nmercury. Among other uses, it is employed by dyers as a mordant to fix\r\ntheir colours. From certain proportions of corrosive sublimate rubbed\r\ntogether, until they are perfectly incorporated, is formed _calomel_; a\r\nsalt which, of late years, has been extensively and most usefully\r\nemployed in medicine.\r\n\r\nA valuable red colour or pigment called _vermilion_, or _artificial\r\ncinnabar_, which was as well known to the ancients as it is to the\r\nmoderns, is usually formed of three parts of mercury and one of sulphur,\r\nmelted together, heated to redness, and then sublimated out of contact\r\nof the air. The manufacture of vermilion was long kept a secret by the\r\nDutch; and it is stated that, before the late war, nearly 50,000 pounds\r\nweight of it were annually made, in three furnaces, by four workmen,\r\nnear Amsterdam. Native cinnabar is sometimes used for the same purpose;\r\nbut the artificial kind is preferred on account of the purity and\r\nbrightness of its colour.\r\n\r\n229. _SILVER is a white, brilliant, sonorous, and ductile metal,\r\nsomewhat more than ten times heavier than water._\r\n\r\n_It is found in different states. Of these the principal is denominated_\r\nnative silver, _from its being nearly in a state of purity. Native\r\nsilver sometimes occurs in small lumps, sometimes in a crystallized\r\nform, and sometimes in leaves, threads, or wire. In many instances the\r\nlatter are so connected with each other as to resemble the branches of\r\ntrees, in which case the ore is called_ dendritic. _There are also\r\nseveral_ ores of silver, _in which this metal is combined with lead,\r\nantimony, arsenic, sulphur, and other substances._\r\n\r\nThe silver that is produced from the mines of Potosi, in South America,\r\nis of the dendritic kind; and is considered by the Spaniards as the\r\npurest that is known. A range of mountains near Potosi, about twenty\r\nmiles in circumference, is said to be perforated by more than 300\r\nshafts, or openings of mines, and to produce, in the whole, from 30,000\r\nto 40,000 dollars’ worth of ore per week. The annual produce of the\r\nsilver mines in America has been estimated at near 2,400,000_l._\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nSilver is also found in several parts of Europe; and, some years ago,\r\nthere were mines of this metal, worked to a great extent, at Konigsberg\r\nin Norway. These were discovered in 1623, and they were found so\r\nprofitable, that in 1751 forty─one shafts and twelve veins were wrought\r\nthere; and 3,500 officers, artificers, and labourers, were employed. The\r\nperpendicular depth of the principal shaft was more than 750 feet.\r\nSpecimens of native silver are not uncommon from some of the\r\ncopper─mines of Cornwall; and, many years ago, a vein of silver ore was,\r\nfor a short time, wrought with considerable advantage in the parish of\r\nAlva, Stirlingshire, Scotland. It is said that from 40,000_l._ to\r\n50,000_l._ worth of silver was obtained from it before the repository\r\nwas exhausted. We are informed that a mass of capillary native silver\r\nwas found, in veins traversing the blue─coloured limestone of Isla, one\r\nof the Western Islands of Scotland. Great quantities of silver are\r\nextracted from lead. There was lately melted in one refining house in\r\nLondon 50,000_l._ worth of this metal, from lead of the Beralston mines\r\nin Devonshire.\r\n\r\nDifferent methods are employed, in different countries, to extract\r\nsilver from its ore. In Mexico and Peru the mineral is pounded, roasted,\r\nwashed, and then mixed with mercury in vessels filled with water; a mill\r\nbeing employed for the more perfectly agitating and mingling them. By\r\nthis process the silver combines with the mercury. The alloy thus\r\nobtained, after undergoing some further processes, is submitted to the\r\naction of heat, by which the mercury passes off in a state of vapour,\r\nleaving the silver behind. The silver is then melted and cast into bars\r\nor ingots. In other countries, after the earthy matters are cleared from\r\nthe silver ore by pounding and washing, the remainder is melted with\r\nlead: which, by a subsequent process, is separated, and leaves the\r\nsilver alone and pure.\r\n\r\nThis metal ranks next in value to gold. Like gold, it is coined into\r\nmoney, and is manufactured into various kinds of utensils, such as\r\ngoblets, vases, spoons, and dishes, which have the general appellation\r\nof _silver plate_. For all these purposes it is alloyed with copper,\r\nwhich does not affect its whiteness, and is not easily detected, unless\r\nit be in too great proportion: the intention of this is to render it\r\nharder than it would otherwise be, and thereby the better to adapt it to\r\nreceive fine and sharp impressions on being cast. Our _standard silver_\r\nis composed of somewhat more than 12¼ parts of pure metal and one part\r\nof copper; and the metal of this standard is used, both for silver\r\nplate, and in the coinage. The mark or stamp which is given to it at\r\nGoldsmiths’ Hall is similar to that which has been explained for\r\nsterling gold.\r\n\r\nAfter platina (226) and gold (227), silver is considered the most\r\nunchangeable of all metals. The air does not easily act upon its surface\r\nin such manner as to injure it; but, when long exposed to the\r\natmosphere, especially in frequented or smoky places, it acquires a\r\ncovering or rust of dark brown colour, which, on examination, is found\r\nto be what chemists denominate _sulphuret of silver_. The fumes of\r\nsulphur and other inflammable substances blacken silver. Various powders\r\nhave been contrived with a view to restore to plate its original lustre;\r\nbut these should be used with caution, as some of them are very\r\ninjurious.\r\n\r\nSilver is nearly as ductile as gold. It may be beaten into leaves so\r\nthin that a single grain in weight will cover a space of more than\r\nfifty─one inches; and it may be drawn into wire much finer than a human\r\nhair, indeed so fine that a single grain of silver has, in this form,\r\nbeen extended nearly to the length of 400 feet. It is this wire gilded\r\nthat has the name of gold wire; and what is denominated _gold lace_\r\n(227) is but flatted silver thread gilt, twisted round silk, and woven.\r\n\r\nThe _plating_ of copper with silver is a very useful operation, and is\r\nthus performed. Plates of silver are bound with iron wire, upon small\r\ningots of copper. The quantity generally allowed is one ounce of silver\r\nto twelve ounces of copper. The surface of the plate of silver is made\r\nnot quite so large as that of the copper; and upon the edges of the\r\ncopper, which are not covered by the silver, a little borax (204) is\r\nput. By exposing the whole to a strong heat, the borax melts; and, in\r\nmelting, contributes to fuse that part of the silver to which it is\r\ncontiguous, and to attach it, in that state, to the copper. The ingot,\r\nwith its silver plate, is then rolled between steel rollers moved by\r\nmachinery, till it is of proper thickness. It is afterwards cut into\r\nsuch sizes and to such shapes as may be required for use. An ounce of\r\nsilver is thus often rolled out into a surface of three square feet,\r\nhaving its thickness, upon the copper, not more than the\r\nthree─thousandth part of an inch. Hence we ought not to be surprised at\r\nthe silver being soon worn from the sharp edges of plated goods. To\r\nprevent this, it is customary, with the best articles, to have all the\r\nedges, and the parts liable to be worn, formed, to a considerable\r\nthickness, of silver.\r\n\r\nWhat is called _French plate_ is made by heating copper, or more\r\nfrequently, brass, to a certain degree, then applying leaf─silver to the\r\nsurface, and strongly rubbing it with a burnisher. The durability of\r\nthis plating depends of course on the number of leaves which are applied\r\non a given surface. For ornaments that are not much used ten leaves may\r\nbe sufficient; but a hundred will not last long, if the metal be exposed\r\nto frequent handling or washing.\r\n\r\nBesides the above, there are various modes of _silvering_ metal\r\narticles, or, as it is called, _washing_ them with silver. All these are\r\nperformed by different chemical preparations of this metal.\r\n\r\nThe article denominated _shell─silver_, used by painters, is prepared,\r\nby carefully grinding silver─leaf, with a little honey or gum water upon\r\na slab, or in a mortar, and separating the honey or gum by means of\r\nwater. When this is washed away, the silver may be put on paper, or kept\r\nin shells, for use. When it is to be used, it must again be diluted with\r\ngum water.\r\n\r\nThe application of silver─leaf for the silvering of paper or wood is\r\nsimilar to that of gold─leaf (227).\r\n\r\nSilver, dissolved in aqua fortis (nitric acid, 30), yields crystals,\r\nwhich, afterwards melted in crucibles, form that grey mass usually\r\ncalled _lunar caustic_, and by chemists _nitrat of silver_. This\r\npreparation is of considerable use in surgical cases, being employed to\r\nkeep down fungous or proud flesh, in wounds and ulcers, and also for the\r\nconsuming of warts, small wens, and other excrescences upon the skin. It\r\nis likewise, though a most violent medicine, sometimes given internally,\r\nbut in very small doses, to persons subject to epileptic fits. The\r\nliquid in which the silver is dissolved becomes excessively caustic. It\r\ngives to the skin, the hair, and almost all animal substances, an\r\nindelible black colour. Hence it is often used as a specific for dyeing\r\nthe human hair. No person, however, would employ it for this purpose,\r\nwho was acquainted with its injurious qualities, not only to the hair\r\nitself, but also to the skin, if permitted to come in contact with it.\r\n\r\nThe article called _indelible_, or _permanent marking ink_, for marking\r\nlinen, and other wearing apparel, is formed by dissolving, in a glass\r\nmortar, two drachms of nitrat of silver, in six drachms of pure water,\r\nand then adding to them two drachms, by measure, of thick gum water.\r\nThis is the ink for writing on the linen.—In another vessel dissolve\r\nhalf an ounce of salt of tartar, or of the subcarbonat of soda, of\r\ncommerce, in four ounces of water; and add to the solution half an\r\nounce, by measure, of thick gum water. This forms the preparatory\r\nliquor. With this the linen is to be thoroughly wetted at the part\r\nintended to be marked. The linen is to be dried, and then to be written\r\nupon by a clean pen dipped in the marking ink. The letters will at first\r\nbe pale, but by exposure to light and heat, they will soon become black;\r\nand be so permanently fixed, that no washing nor bleaching can efface\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the curious has of late been turned to a very\r\nextraordinary compound called _fulminating silver_, which explodes\r\nwithout heat, and with even the slightest degree of friction. Of this\r\ncompound little _fulminating balls_ have been made. These are globules\r\nof thin glass, each somewhat larger than a pea, and containing a grain\r\nor two of fulminating silver. After the silver is put in, it is secured\r\nby a piece of soft paper, pasted over the ball, so as completely to\r\ncover it. These balls explode by merely crushing them under the heel of\r\nthe shoe. What are called _fulminating bombs_ are similar balls, but of\r\nthe size of hazel nuts. No one should attempt to explode these by\r\ncrushing them with the shoe, as their explosive effect is so violent as\r\nsometimes to prove injurious.\r\n\r\nFulminating silver requires the utmost care. It should never be put into\r\nphials, nor should it be in any way handled so as to produce much\r\nfriction. It is the most dangerous preparation that is known. The mere\r\ntouch of a hard substance will sometimes explode it; and its very\r\npreparation is so hazardous that this ought never to be attempted\r\nwithout a mask upon the face with strong glass eyes.\r\n\r\nThe following are three pleasing experiments with preparations of\r\nsilver:\r\n\r\n1. Mix or amalgamate together four parts of silver leaf with two parts\r\nof mercury (228) and dissolve this in diluted aqua fortis. To the\r\nsolution add as much water as will be equal to thirty times the weight\r\nof the metals employed. Pour a portion of the above mixture into a\r\nphial, and place at the bottom a small piece of silver. After it has\r\nstood awhile, little filaments of silver will be seen to shoot up from\r\nit somewhat in the form of a shrub. This apparent vegetation is\r\npopularly called the _tree of Diana_.\r\n\r\n2. A production nearly similar may be obtained by adding a little\r\nquicksilver to a solution of nitrat of silver in water.\r\n\r\n3. Drop upon a clean plate of copper a small quantity of solution of\r\nlunar caustic, or nitrat of silver. In a short time a metallic\r\nvegetation will be perceptible, branching out in pleasing forms, and in\r\nvarious directions.\r\n\r\n230. _COPPER is a red or orange─coloured metal, about nine times heavier\r\nthan water. It is the most sonorous of all metals, and, except iron, the\r\nmost elastic._\r\n\r\n_It is found under a great variety of forms, sometimes in masses of pure\r\nmetal, but, more frequently, in combination with other substances,\r\nparticularly sulphur._\r\n\r\nThere are valuable copper mines in every quarter of the world; and the\r\nuse of copper is probably of greater antiquity than that of any other\r\nmetal. It is mentioned in the Old Testament; and, at a very early\r\nperiod, domestic utensils and instruments of war were made of bronze, or\r\na compound of copper and tin. Even during the Trojan war, as we learn\r\nfrom Homer, the combatants had no other armour than what was made of\r\nbronze. The Greek and Roman sculptors are said to have executed fine\r\nworks of art in porphyry, granite, and other hard minerals, by means of\r\ncopper instruments; whence historians have been induced to believe that\r\nthe ancients possessed the secret of rendering this metal as hard as\r\nsteel: some of them even imagined that they had the means of converting\r\nit into steel.\r\n\r\nCopper is very abundant in several parts of Great Britain, particularly\r\nin the island of Anglesea. The copper mines of Anglesea are situated on\r\nthe top of a mountain, and form an enormous cavity more than five\r\nhundred yards long, a hundred yards broad, and a hundred yards deep. The\r\nore is got from the mine by pickaxes, and blasting with gunpowder. It is\r\nthen broken with hammers into small pieces, an operation which is\r\nchiefly performed by women and children. After this, it is piled into\r\nkilns of great length, and each about six feet high; from the upper\r\nparts of which flues are attached that communicate with what are called\r\nsulphur chambers. The kilns are closely covered; and fires are lighted\r\nin different parts, that the ore may undergo the process of roasting.\r\nThe whole mass gradually kindles, and the sulphur, which is combined\r\nwith the ore, is expelled in fumes, by the heat, and is conveyed,\r\nthrough the flues, to the sulphur chamber. This process occupies from\r\nthree to ten months, according to the size of the kilns; and, during\r\nthat period, the sulphur chamber is cleared four or five times. When the\r\noperation is complete, or the ore is freed from the sulphur, it is taken\r\nto places denominated slacking pits. It is subsequently conveyed to the\r\nsmelting houses, where, by intense heat, the pure metal is drawn off in\r\na fluid state.\r\n\r\nAs the water, which passes through several parts of the Paris mine, is\r\nstrongly impregnated with sulphat of copper (209), or copper held in\r\nsolution by sulphuric acid (24), the proprietors turn the course of this\r\nwater through certain large and shallow pits, which they have formed for\r\nthe purpose, and in each of which they place a quantity of iron. A\r\ndecomposition here takes place: the iron is corroded, and, at length,\r\nentirely dissolved, and the copper, in the form of a brown mud, falls to\r\nthe bottom. One ton weight of iron, thus immersed, will produce nearly\r\ntwo tons of copper mud, each of which, when melted, will yield sixteen\r\nhundred weight of metal. This mode of obtaining copper is said to have\r\nbeen an accidental discovery from one of the workmen, several years ago,\r\nhaving left a shovel in the water, which, when afterwards taken out,\r\nappeared changed into copper.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the above mentioned copper works may readily be\r\nconceived, when it is stated that the beds of ore are, in some places,\r\nmore than sixty feet in depth: that the proprietors employ more than\r\n1000 workmen; and that they ship, from the adjacent port of Amlwch,\r\nupwards of 20,000 tons of copper, annually.\r\n\r\nThere is at Ecton, in Staffordshire, a copper mine which is now worked\r\nat the depth of 1416 feet below the surface of the ground. This is the\r\ndeepest mine in England.\r\n\r\nThe uses of copper are numerous and important. When rolled into sheets,\r\nbetwixt large iron cylinders, it is employed for the covering of houses,\r\nsheathing the bottoms of ships, and other purposes. As a covering for\r\nhouses, copper is lighter than slate, but whether it be more durable has\r\nnot been yet ascertained. The coppering of ships tends to facilitate\r\ntheir progress through the water, by presenting a smoother surface than\r\nthat of wood, and not permitting shell animals to fasten to it as they\r\ndo to wood. It likewise preserves the bottoms of the ships from being\r\npunctured by marine worms; and consequently secures to them a longer\r\nduration than they would otherwise have. Plates, or flat pieces of\r\ncopper, are used by artists for engraving pictures upon, either by\r\ncutting them with a sharp steel instrument, or corroding them with aqua\r\nfortis (206), in lines drawn by a needle through a thin coat of wax\r\nspread upon their surface.\r\n\r\nCopper is manufactured into various kinds of cooking utensils. Great\r\ncare, however, ought to be taken that acid liquors, or even water\r\nintended for drinking, or to be mixed with food, be not suffered to\r\nstand long in such vessels, otherwise they will dissolve so much of the\r\nmetal as to give them disagreeable and even poisonous qualities. Yet, it\r\nis remarkable that, while acid liquors are kept boiling, they do not\r\nseem to dissolve any of the metal. Hence it is that confectioners, by\r\nskilful management, prepare the most acid syrups in copper vessels,\r\nwithout their receiving any unpleasant taste or injurious quality from\r\nthe metal. All vessels formed of this metal which are employed in\r\ncookery, ought to have their inner surface covered with a coat of tin\r\n(238).\r\n\r\nAs copper does not, like iron, strike fire by collision, it has on this,\r\nas well as on some other accounts, been substituted for iron in the\r\nmachinery which is employed in gunpowder mills. It is also made into\r\nwater pipes, and sometimes into sash frames. Under the hammer it is\r\ncapable of being beaten into thin leaves like gold. Copper wire is much\r\nemployed by bell─hangers and other artisans. The filings of this metal\r\nare used for giving a green colour to some kinds of artificial\r\nfire─works.\r\n\r\nSeveral preparations of copper are employed in medicine, some of them\r\ninternally, and others externally; but most of the former are violently\r\nemetic.\r\n\r\n_Verdigris_ is a rust or oxide (21) of copper, usually prepared from\r\nthat metal by corroding it with vinegar. There is a large manufactory of\r\nverdigris at Montpelier in France. The workmen place alternate strata of\r\ncopper plates and husks of grapes, the latter of which speedily become\r\nacid and corrode the metal. The verdigris, thus formed, is scraped off\r\nas it collects on the surface; it is afterwards dried, and put in bags\r\nor casks for sale. A manufactory of verdigris has lately been\r\nestablished at Deptford, near London.\r\n\r\nA solution of this substance in distilled vinegar affords permanent\r\ncrystals, which are improperly called _distilled verdigris_, and are\r\nmade into a green paint. Verdigris is principally consumed by dyers in\r\ncombination with logwood, for striking a black colour. It is a virulent\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nOxide of copper is employed for giving a beautiful green colour to\r\nporcelain. It also imparts the same colour to glass, and hence is\r\nfrequently employed for the formation of artificial emeralds.\r\n\r\n                          _Alloys of Copper._\r\n\r\nOf all metals that are known, copper is the most susceptible of alloy.\r\nThe most frequent and useful of these alloys are made with copper and\r\nzinc, in different proportions.\r\n\r\n_Brass_ is an alloy composed of three parts of copper, and about a\r\nfourth part of zinc (241). It is a beautiful, useful, and well─known\r\nyellow metal. Not being so apt to tarnish and rust as copper, and being,\r\nin other respects, better adapted for the purpose than that metal, it is\r\nmuch used for clock─work, and for mathematical and astronomical\r\ninstruments. It is more ductile than either copper or iron, and hence is\r\npeculiarly fitted to be made into wire, for the strings of musical\r\ninstruments, and other purposes. Sieves are woven with brass wire, after\r\nthe manner of cambric weaving, and of such extreme fineness that similar\r\nones could not possibly be made with copper wire. Brass wire, flatted\r\nand gilded, is sometimes made into lace. The finest brass is\r\nmanufactured at Geneva. It unites great beauty of colour to a high\r\ndegree of ductility; and is used chiefly for escapement wheels, and\r\nother nicer parts of watch─making. For work in which there is no\r\nfriction it is necessary to cover brass with a kind of varnish or\r\n_laquer_, to improve its colour, and prevent it from being tarnished by\r\nexposure to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n_Prince’s Metal_, or _Pinchbeck_, is an alloy containing three parts of\r\nzinc (241), and four of copper. This metal has nearly the same colour as\r\ngold, and was formerly much in use for the manufacture of ornamental\r\narticles of different kinds.\r\n\r\n_Dutch Gold_ is formed by the cementation of copper─plates with calamine\r\n(241), hammered out into leaves. This article is chiefly manufactured in\r\nHolland and Germany, and has about five times the thickness of gold\r\nleaf.\r\n\r\n_Bronze_, and _the metal of which cannons are made_, consist of from six\r\nto twelve parts of tin (238) combined with 100 parts of copper. This\r\nalloy is brittle, heavier than copper, and of a yellow colour. Before\r\nthe method of working iron was brought to perfection, it was used by the\r\nancients for the manufacture of sharp─pointed instruments; and it is\r\nsupposed to have been the _æs_ or brass of the Romans.\r\n\r\n_Bell Metal_, or the metal of which bells are formed, is usually\r\ncomposed of three parts of copper and one of tin. Its colour is greyish\r\nwhite; and it is very hard, sonorous, and elastic.\r\n\r\nBronze and bell metal are not, however, always made of copper and tin\r\nonly. They frequently have other admixtures, consisting of lead, zinc,\r\nor arsenic. Bell─makers sometimes abuse the vulgar credulity by\r\npretending that they add a certain quantity of silver to the alloy, for\r\nthe purpose of rendering the bells more melodious: but they are better\r\nacquainted with their business than to employ so valuable a metal in the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n_White Copper_ is an alloy composed of equal parts of copper and arsenic\r\n(242). The metal produced by this mixture is of a whitish colour, but\r\nwith a coppery tinge. It is freed from the latter by being melted\r\nseveral times; and, by this process, is at last rendered as white as\r\nsilver. White copper is very brittle; but, if the arsenic be evaporated\r\nby heat, it resumes its ductility, and still preserves its white colour.\r\nWhen the operation is well performed, it is easy, at the first glance,\r\nto mistake white copper for silver; but the difference may immediately\r\nbe ascertained from the properties inherent to the two metals.\r\n\r\nWhite copper is employed in the manufacture of many kinds of trinkets:\r\nand of a great number of domestic utensils; such as tea─pots,\r\ncoffee─pots, and candle─sticks.\r\n\r\n231. _MALACHITE is a solid green copper ore, the surface of which has\r\nfrequently a bubbled appearance, and the interior is marked with\r\nnumerous irregular zones, and layers of different shades of green. It is\r\nsomewhat more than three times as heavy as water, and is so soft as to\r\nbe easily scratched by a knife._\r\n\r\nIn its appearance, malachite somewhat resembles green jasper; but it is\r\nby no means so hard. It is, however, capable of being cut and polished\r\nas a gem, and is manufactured into various kinds of trinkets, which of\r\nlate years have been much in request for necklaces, brooches, and\r\nbracelets. It is also cut into slabs, and mounted into snuff─boxes. Such\r\nis the size of which it is sometimes found, that M. Patrin saw, at\r\nPetersburgh, a plate of malachite thirty─two inches long and seventeen\r\ninches broad, which was valued at 20,000 livres; but the finest\r\nspecimens in Europe are some slabs that are adapted as the tops of\r\ntables, sideboards, &c. at Trianon, in the Park of Versailles: the\r\nlargest of these are nearly four feet in length and two feet wide. They\r\nmay indeed have been formed by various pieces joined together; but, if\r\nso, the joints are so completely concealed as not to be discoverable\r\neven by the closest examination. Malachite is sometimes employed for the\r\nengraving of cameos, but is seldom cut in intaglio. Smaller pieces of\r\nthis substance, that are used for trinkets, are about the same value as\r\ncarnelian. Independently of its use, in the above respects, and also as\r\nan ore of copper, malachite, when pure, is ground into powder, and\r\nemployed as a green pigment.\r\n\r\nThe Vosges Mountains in Lorraine, and certain copper mines of Saxony,\r\nare celebrated for producing very fine specimens of malachite. This\r\nbeautiful mineral is also found in our own country, in the copper mines\r\nof Cornwall and Wales.\r\n\r\n_232. TURQUOISE. The beautiful light blue substances that are called\r\nturquoises have usually been considered as the bones or teeth of\r\nanimals, impregnated with blue oxide (21) of copper; but they are\r\nsometimes found in nodules which are certainly not of an osseous\r\nnature._\r\n\r\nTurquoises are frequently set in rings, necklaces, brooches, and other\r\nfemale ornaments. In Persia they are very common; and, amongst the\r\nTurks, are held in such estimation that persons of rank almost\r\nconstantly wear them in some part of their dress, as ring─stones, and to\r\nadorn the handles of stilettoes. They are imported into England from\r\nRussia, stuck with pitch upon the ends of straws; because if mixed\r\ntogether in parcels, the purchaser would not easily be able, in turning\r\nthem over, to observe their colour, and ascertain their value.\r\n\r\nIn the turquoise there is nothing that can recommend it to notice except\r\nthe agreeable softness of its colour, which is particularly\r\ndistinguishable by candle─light; this alone has rendered it so\r\nfashionable as an ornament in female dress, for rings, ear─drops, and\r\nbrooches, that the demand for it is at present greater than the supply.\r\nImitations of turquoise are easily made in paste, and not unfrequently\r\nimposed upon the ignorant purchaser; but in these, though the colour is\r\ncorrectly given, there is a glassy lustre much higher than that of the\r\nreal stone.\r\n\r\nOf late years a spurious kind of turquoise has also found its way into\r\nEurope, which is much softer than the genuine kind; has more of a green\r\nthan a blue cast, and is by no means capable of so good a polish.\r\n\r\n233. _IRON is a well─known metal, of livid greyish colour, hard and\r\nelastic, and capable of receiving a high polish. Its weight is nearly\r\neight times as great as that of water._\r\n\r\n_It is seldom found in a truly native state, but occurs, abundantly, in\r\nalmost every country of the world, in a state of oxide (21), and\r\nmineralized with sulphuric (24), carbonic (26), and other acids._\r\n\r\n_Iron is found in plants, in several kinds of coloured stones, and even\r\nin the blood of animals._\r\n\r\nOf all the metals there are none which, in the whole, are so useful, or\r\nare so copiously and variously dispersed as iron. Its uses were\r\nascertained at a very early period of the world. Moses speaks of\r\nfurnaces for iron, and of the ores from which it was extracted, and\r\ntells us that swords, knives, axes, and instruments for cutting stones,\r\nwere, in his time, all made of this metal.\r\n\r\nThe most considerable iron mines at present existing are those in Great\r\nBritain and France. After iron ore is dug out of the earth, it is\r\ncrushed or broken into small pieces, by machinery. It is next washed, to\r\ndetach the grosser particles of earth which adhere to it. This operation\r\nended, it is roasted in kilns, formed for the purpose, by which the\r\nsulphur, and some other substances that are capable of being separated\r\nby heat, are detached. It is then thrown into a furnace, mixed with a\r\ncertain portion of limestone and charcoal, to be melted. Near the bottom\r\nof the furnace there is a tap─hole, through which the liquid metal is\r\ndischarged into furrows made in a bed of sand. The larger masses, or\r\nthose which flow into the main furrow, are called _sows_; the smaller\r\nones are denominated _pigs_ of iron; and the general name of the metal\r\nin this state is _cast iron_.\r\n\r\nWith us iron is employed in three states, of cast iron, wrought iron,\r\nand steel.\r\n\r\n_Cast iron_ is distinguishable, by its properties of being, in general,\r\nso hard as to resist both the hammer and the file; being extremely\r\nbrittle, and for the most part, of a dark grey or blackish colour.\r\n\r\nA great number of useful and important articles are formed of cast iron,\r\nsuch as grates, chimney backs, pots, boilers, pipes, and cannon shot.\r\nThese are made by casting ladles full of the liquid metal into moulds\r\nthat are shaped, for the purpose, in sifted sand.\r\n\r\n_Wrought iron._ The process of converting cast iron into wrought or\r\nmalleable iron, is called _blooming_. The cast iron is thrown into the\r\nfurnace, and kept melted by the flame of combustibles which is made to\r\nplay upon its surface. Here it is suffered to continue for about two\r\nhours, a workman constantly stirring it, until, notwithstanding the\r\ncontinuance of the heat, it gradually acquires consistency, and\r\ncongeals. It is then taken out, while hot, and violently beaten with a\r\nlarge hammer worked by machinery. In this state it is formed into bars\r\nfor sale.\r\n\r\nThe value of iron is beyond all estimate, and infinitely greater than\r\neven that of gold. By means of this metal the earth has been cultivated\r\nand subdued. Without it houses, cities, and ships, could not have been\r\nbuilt; and few arts could have been practised. It forms also the\r\nmachinery by which the most useful and important mechanical powers are\r\ngenerated and applied.\r\n\r\n_Steel_ is usually made by a process called _cementation_. This consists\r\nin keeping bars of iron in contact with powdered charcoal, during a\r\nstate of ignition, for several hours, in earthen troughs, or crucibles,\r\nthe mouths of which are stopped up with clay. Steel, if heated to\r\nredness, and suffered to cool slowly, becomes soft; but if plunged,\r\nwhilst hot, into cold water, it acquires extreme hardness. It may be\r\nrendered so hard as even to scratch glass; and at the same time, it\r\nbecomes more brittle and elastic than it was before. Although thus\r\nhardened, it may have its softness and ductility restored, by being\r\nagain heated, and suffered to cool slowly. A piece of polished steel, in\r\nheating, assumes first a straw─yellow colour, then a lighter yellow,\r\nnext becomes purple, then violet, then red, next deep blue, and at last\r\nof all bright blue. At this period it becomes red hot, the colours\r\ndisappear, and metallic scales are formed upon, and encrust its surface.\r\nAll these different shades of colour indicate the different tempers that\r\nthe steel acquires by the increase of heat, from that which renders it\r\nproper for files, to that which fits it for the manufacture of watch\r\nsprings. Mr. Stoddart has availed himself of this property to give to\r\nsurgical, and other cutting instruments, those degrees of temper which\r\ntheir various uses require.\r\n\r\nThe kind of steel which has been most celebrated in this country is that\r\nimported from Syria under the name of _Damascus steel_. Germany is also\r\nnoted for its steel. The best steel manufactured in Britain is known by\r\nthe name of _cast steel_; and the making of it, although it was long\r\nkept a profound secret, is now discovered to be a simple process. It\r\nconsists merely in fusing it with carbonat of lime (140), or in what is\r\ncalled cementation, with charcoal powder, in a peculiar kind of furnace.\r\nThe iron produced in Sweden is considered superior to that of any other\r\ncountry in Europe for the manufacture of steel.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of edge tools, where excellence is required, are made of\r\nsteel; and a steel instrument may be immediately known from an iron one,\r\nby letting fall upon it a drop of nitric acid or aqua fortis (206),\r\nsomewhat diluted with water. If it be steel, this will occasion a black\r\nspot; but if it be iron, it will not have this effect. Steel is\r\nattracted by the magnet, and is capable of receiving a permanent\r\n_magnetic property_, which has led to the discovery of the mariner’s\r\ncompass. Had iron been productive of no other advantages to mankind than\r\nthis, it would on this account alone have been entitled to their\r\ngreatest attention.\r\n\r\nIron, when exposed to the moisture of the atmosphere, becomes gradually\r\ncovered with a brown, or yellowish substance, known by the name of\r\n_rust_, which, if suffered to continue without interruption, will\r\ncorrode the entire substance of the iron. The rust or oxide of iron (21)\r\nis a substance in considerable request by calico printers for a dye.\r\n_Iron─moulds_ are spots on linen occasioned by its exposure to iron in\r\ndamp situations; these are removeable only by the application of an\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nThere are various modes of _preserving iron and steel_ from rust. The\r\nfollowing is recommended by an eminent French chemist as one of the\r\nbest. Mix copal varnish, made greasy with oil, with about four─fifths of\r\nthe best spirit of turpentine. Apply this by means of a sponge, over the\r\nwhole surface, and allow it to dry. This varnish may be successfully\r\nused for all the metals; and particularly for the preservation of such\r\nphilosophical instruments as, by being brought into contact with water,\r\nare liable to lose their splendour, and become tarnished.\r\n\r\n234. _METEORIC STONES are a species of iron ore, which have at different\r\ntimes been known to fall from the atmosphere._\r\n\r\n_They have been seen only in shapeless masses, of from a few ounces to\r\nseveral hundred pounds in weight. Their texture is granular. They are\r\ncovered externally with a thin blackish crust, and are, internally, of\r\nan ashy grey colour, mixed with shining minute particles._\r\n\r\nThere is sufficient evidence to show that solid masses of stone have\r\nbeen observed to fall from the air at a period considerably anterior to\r\nthe Christian era. Notwithstanding this, so very extraordinary was the\r\nphenomenon, that, until the year 1802, it was generally regarded by\r\nphilosophers as a vulgar error. Mr. Howard, in that year, submitted to\r\nthe Royal Society a paper which contained an accurate examination of the\r\ntestimonies connected with events of this kind; and described a minute\r\nanalysis of several of the substances which had been said to have fallen\r\nin different parts of the globe. The result of his examination was that\r\nall these stony bodies differ completely from every other known stone;\r\nthat they all resemble each other, and are all composed of the same\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of the stones which have fallen from the air have\r\nbeen preceded by the appearance of luminous bodies or meteors. These\r\nmeteors have burst with an explosion, and then the shower of stones has\r\nfallen to the earth. Sometimes the stones have continued luminous until\r\nthey sunk into the earth, but most commonly their luminousness\r\ndisappeared at the time of the explosion. Their motion through the air\r\nis surprisingly rapid, in a direction nearly horizontal; but they seem\r\nto approach the earth before they explode. In their flight they have\r\nfrequently been heard to yield a loud whizzing sound. They are hot when\r\nthey first reach the earth; and exhibit, on their surface, visible marks\r\nof fusion.\r\n\r\nA general tradition has prevailed in almost all ages, and amongst all\r\npeople, of the fall of solid bodies from the atmosphere, under various\r\ndenominations, but, with us, more particularly, under that of\r\n_thunderbolts_. In barbarous and uncivilized countries, these have\r\nusually been ascribed to the miraculous judgment of the deity; and they\r\nmay be considered as the true origin of the worship of stones. The image\r\nof Diana, mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, as believed by the\r\nEphesians to have fallen down from Jupiter, and the Palladium or sacred\r\nstatue of Minerva, which also is said to have fallen from Heaven, and to\r\nhave been preserved in Troy, as a treasure, on the safety of which that\r\nof the city depended, had each, no doubt, this origin. The Psalmist\r\nevidently alludes to the falling of meteoric stones, when, speaking of\r\nthe Almighty, he says, “He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion\r\nround about him with dark water, and thick clouds to cover him. At the\r\nbrightness of his presence his clouds removed; hailstones and coals of\r\nfire. The Lord also thundered out of Heaven, and the Highest gave his\r\nthunder; hailstones and coals of fire.”\r\n\r\nAmong numerous other instances of these stones, it is recorded that, on\r\nthe seventh of November, 1492, betwixt eleven and twelve o’clock at\r\nnoon, a dreadful clap of thunder was heard at Ensisheim, a considerable\r\ntown in Alsace, and that a huge stone was seen to fall on a field lately\r\nsown with wheat. On several of the neighbours going to the place, the\r\nhole it had formed was found to be about three feet in depth, and the\r\nstone when dug out, weighed two hundred and sixty pounds. It was\r\npreserved in the cathedral of Ensisheim until the beginning of the\r\nFrench Revolution, when it was conveyed to the public library at Colmar.\r\nThere are in the British Museum two small pieces of this stone, and\r\nfragments of several other meteoric stones which have fallen in\r\ndifferent parts of the world.\r\n\r\nTwo stones fell near Verona in Italy, in the year 1672, one of which\r\nweighed three hundred, and the other two hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nMr. Sowerby, the publisher of English Botany, and of several other\r\nhighly estimable works, possessed a meteoric stone which fell near Wold\r\nNewton in Yorkshire, in the afternoon of the thirteenth of December,\r\n1795, and weighed fifty─six pounds. Whilst this stone was in motion\r\nthrough the air, several persons perceived a body passing along the\r\nclouds, although they were unable to ascertain what it was. It passed\r\nover several different villages, and was also accurately and distinctly\r\nheard. The day was foggy; and, though there was some thunder and\r\nlightning at a distance, it was not until the stone fell that an\r\nexplosion took place which alarmed all the adjacent country; and\r\ncreated, distinctly, a sensation that something very extraordinary had\r\nhappened. A shepherd belonging to Captain Topham was within a hundred\r\nand fifty yards of the place where it fell; George Sawden, a carpenter,\r\nwithin sixty yards; and John Shepley, one of Captain Topham’s farming\r\nservants, was so near that he was forcibly struck by some of the mud and\r\nearth that were raised by the stone dashing into the ground. In its fall\r\nthe stone excavated a place nineteen inches in depth (seven inches of\r\nwhich were in a solid rock of chalk), and somewhat more than three feet\r\nin diameter, fixing itself so firmly that some labour was required to\r\ndig it out.\r\n\r\nAnother stone of considerable size fell in Scotland on the fifth of\r\nApril, 1704. A misty commotion was observed in the atmosphere, and,\r\nnearly at the time of the stone falling, a report was heard as loud as\r\nif three or four cannon had been fired at a little distance. The report\r\nwas succeeded by a violent rushing or whizzing noise; and, almost\r\nimmediately afterwards, the stone fell into a drain, in the presence of\r\ntwo men and two boys, splashing the water to a distance of twenty feet\r\naround. The stone, when dug out, was found to have sunk about eighteen\r\ninches into the earth.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of November, 1814, about half past four o’clock in the\r\nafternoon, a dreadful peal of thunder was heard in the Doab in Persia,\r\nand was immediately succeeded by a shower of large stones, many of them\r\nfrom twenty─six to thirty pounds weight each. Several inhabitants of the\r\nadjacent country were present at the time; and not fewer than nineteen\r\nof the stones were collected.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pallas, many years ago, discovered lying on the surface of a\r\nhill in Siberia, a mass of native iron, which weighed 1680 pounds. It\r\nwas considered by the natives as a holy relic, and was believed by them\r\nto have fallen from heaven. M. de Bougainville, the French\r\ncircumnavigator, discovered, on the banks of the river La Plata, in\r\nSouth America, an enormous mass of native iron, which he calculated to\r\nhave weighed about 100,000 pounds. And a mass of native iron, appearing\r\nin every respect to have been of meteoric origin, was, some years ago,\r\ndiscovered in the district of St. Jago del Estro, in South America. It\r\nwas in the middle of a great plain, and had no rock nor mountain near\r\nit, and was calculated to have weighed about thirty tons.\r\n\r\nThe origin of meteoric stones is involved in great obscurity. Some\r\nwriters have imagined that they might be projected from distant\r\nvolcanoes; others, that they may have been detached from rocks, and had\r\ntheir substance considerably changed by a concurrence of natural causes;\r\nothers, that they may have been generated in the air by a combination of\r\nmineral substances; and others, that they may have been projected from\r\nthe moon. The latter was the opinion of La Place the astronomer, who\r\nsays that a mass, if thrown by a volcano from the moon, with a velocity\r\nof about a mile and half per second, it will thence be projected beyond\r\nthe sphere of the moon’s attraction, and into the confines of that of\r\nthe earth; the consequence of which will be, that the mass must\r\npresently fall to the earth, and become a part of it.\r\n\r\n235. _LOADSTONE, or MAGNETIC IRONSTONE, is a compact blackish kind of\r\niron ore, which is possessed of the power of attracting iron, as well as\r\nevery substance which contains ferruginous particles. It is betwixt four\r\nand five times as heavy as water._\r\n\r\nThis mineral is found in masses of different form and size in most of\r\nthe iron mines of Europe and America, and, when submitted to the\r\nfurnace, it yields a considerable proportion of metal. It makes\r\nexcellent bar iron, but very indifferent cast iron. In Sweden, and\r\nparticularly at Roslager, magnetic iron stone is found quite pure, and\r\nthe iron that is wrought from it is imported in considerable quantities\r\ninto Great Britain, for the purpose of being manufactured into steel.\r\n\r\nThe appellation of load, or leading stone, has been given to this kind\r\nof iron from its magnetic virtues; for it is not only endowed with the\r\nproperty of attracting iron, but also of pointing itself, and even\r\nenabling a needle touched with it to point, towards the poles of the\r\nworld. We are, however, entirely ignorant what is the cause of this very\r\nextraordinary property.\r\n\r\nArtificial magnets, constructed of steel, not only possess all the\r\nessential virtues of the genuine loadstone, but even in a much higher\r\ndegree. The natural magnet is consequently now little esteemed except as\r\nan object of curiosity.\r\n\r\n236. _PYRITES, or MARCASITE, is a mineral substance, formed by a\r\ncombination of iron with sulphur._\r\n\r\n_It is usually of a bronze, yellow, or brownish colour, very various in\r\nform, being massive, globular, club─shaped, oval, or crystallized; and\r\nso hard as to strike fire with flint._\r\n\r\nFew minerals are more common than this, as it occurs, in some state or\r\nother, in almost every rock and vein. It is often found among coals;\r\nand, when heated, decrepitates with a loud unpleasant noise and\r\nsulphureous smell. To the decomposition of this mineral it is that the\r\nhot temperature of almost all the mineral waters may be ascribed.\r\n\r\nThe name of pyrites, which in the Greek language signifies _firestone_,\r\nhas been obtained by this mineral from its property of striking sparks\r\nfrom steel. It was formerly used for fire─arms, as we now use flints. In\r\ncommerce it is known by the name of marcasite. Some years ago it was\r\nmuch used, particularly in France, for the making of buttons and\r\nbuckles; and was cut and polished, by lapidaries, for trinkets,\r\nparticularly for the rims and hands of watches, and various kinds of\r\nfemale ornaments. If skilfully cut in the form of small rose diamonds,\r\nalthough an opaque substance, it has somewhat the appearance of a\r\ndiamond. In the tombs of the Peruvian princes, with whom a considerable\r\nportion of their valuables was always interred, there have been found\r\npolished plates of marcasite, which appear to have served them as\r\nmirrors.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is never worked as an ore of iron; and it is principally\r\nvalued on account of the sulphur which can be obtained from it by means\r\nof heat; and the green vitriol, or copperas (208), which it affords by\r\nexposure to the air.\r\n\r\nIgnorant persons frequently mistake iron pyrites for gold; but it is\r\neasily distinguished from that precious metal by its brittleness. It\r\nbreaks when hammered, whereas gold is malleable, or may be extended by\r\nhammering: it also strikes fire with steel, which gold will not.\r\n\r\n237. _RED OCHRE, REDDLE, or RED CHALK, is an iron ore of blood─red\r\ncolour, which is sometimes found in powder, and sometimes in a hardened\r\nstate. It has an earthy texture, and stains the fingers when handled._\r\n\r\nThe principal use of red chalk is for drawing: the coarser kinds are\r\nemployed by carpenters and other mechanics, and the finer kinds by\r\npainters. For the latter purpose it should be free from grit, and not\r\ntoo hard. In order to free it from imperfections, and render it better\r\nfor use, it is sometimes pounded, washed, mixed with gum, and cast into\r\nmoulds of convenient shape and size.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of reddle, this substance is much used for the marking of\r\nsheep; and (when mixed with oil) for the painting of pales, gates, and\r\nthe wood─work of out─buildings.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of iron ore, or rather a compound of the ores of iron and\r\nmanganese, is called _umber_. This mineral, which is of a brown colour,\r\nis found in beds in the island of Cyprus, and is used as a kind of paint\r\nboth in a raw state and burnt.\r\n\r\n238. _TIN is a white metal, somewhat like silver in appearance, but is\r\nconsiderably lighter, and makes a squeaking or crackling noise when\r\nbent. It is very soft and ductile, and has but little elasticity._\r\n\r\n_This metal is always found either in a state of oxide (21), or in\r\ncombination with sulphur and copper; and is about seven times as heavy\r\nas water._\r\n\r\nThe principal tin mines which are known to us are those of Cornwall,\r\nDevonshire, Germany; the island of Banca, and peninsula of Malacca, in\r\nIndia; and Chili and Mexico in America. Of these the most celebrated are\r\nthe mines of Cornwall, which are known to have been worked before the\r\ncommencement of the Christian era. Diodorus Siculus, who wrote forty\r\nyears before the birth of Christ, gives an account of these mines, and\r\nsays that their produce was conveyed to Gaul, and thence to different\r\nparts of Italy. This species of metal was used in the time of Moses, and\r\nis mentioned in the writings of Homer.\r\n\r\nTin is found in veins, or beds, but chiefly in veins, running through\r\ngranite and other rocks. In some of the valleys and low grounds of\r\nCornwall, the tin ore is found in rounded grains and masses. In these\r\nsituations, small grains of gold are sometimes found with it. To\r\nseparate the tin from earthy and other matters with which it is\r\nintermixed, streams of water are passed over them; and these deposits\r\nhave the name of _stream─works_.\r\n\r\nWhen the tin ore has been dug from the earth, or has been collected at\r\nthese stream─works, it is thrown into heaps, and broken to pieces. After\r\nthis it is washed, and subsequently roasted in an intense heat, for the\r\npurpose of dissipating some of the substances with which it is combined.\r\nIt is lastly melted in a furnace, and thereby reduced to a metallic\r\nstate. The metal is then poured into quadrangular moulds of stone, each\r\ncontaining about 320 pounds weight. These have the denomination of\r\n_block─tin_, and are stamped by officers of the Duke of Cornwall, with\r\nthe impression of a lion, the arms of that duchy. This is rendered a\r\nnecessary operation before the tin can be offered for sale; and on\r\nstamping, it pays a duty of four shillings per hundred weight to the\r\nPrince of Wales, as Duke of Cornwall, who thence derives a very\r\nconsiderable income.\r\n\r\nThe article usually called _tin_, or _tin─plate_, and, in Scotland,\r\n_white iron_, of which saucepans, boilers, drinking vessels, and other\r\nutensils of domestic economy are made, consists only of thin iron plate\r\ncoated with tin. It is thus formed. The iron plates are immersed in\r\nwater rendered slightly acid by spirit of salt (muriatic acid, 202) or\r\nspirit of vitriol (sulphuric acid, 211): after which, to clean them\r\ncompletely, they are scoured quite bright. These plates are then each\r\ndipped into a vessel filled with melted tin, the surface of which is\r\ncovered with suet, pitch, or resin, to prevent the formation of dross\r\nupon it. The tin not only covers the surface of the iron, but completely\r\npenetrates it, giving to its whole substance a white colour.\r\n\r\nIn a manner similar to this, stirrups, buckles, bridle─bits, and other\r\narticles, are tinned.\r\n\r\nIron is usually tinned before, but copper always after it has been\r\nformed into utensils. The object to be attained by the tinning of copper\r\nis to prevent the vessels made of that metal from being corroded, and to\r\npreserve the food prepared in them from being mixed with any particles\r\nof that poisonous substance called verdigris, which is formed by such\r\ncorrosion. In the tinning of copper vessels, their interior surface is\r\nfirst scraped very clean with an iron instrument, and then rubbed over\r\nwith sal─ammoniac (207), for the purpose of more completely cleansing\r\nthem, and also of preventing the formation of verdigris from the copper\r\nduring the operation. The vessel is then heated, and a little pitch is\r\nthrown into it. While quite hot, a piece of tin is applied to the\r\ncopper, and this, instantly uniting with it, soon clothes the whole\r\nsurface with tin.\r\n\r\nThis metal, when amalgamated with mercury, is used for the silvering of\r\nlooking─glasses (228). When tin is melted in an open vessel, its surface\r\nis soon found to be covered with a grey powder, which is an oxide (21)\r\nof the metal, and is generally called _dross_. If the heat be continued,\r\nthe colour of this powder becomes yellow. In this state it is known by\r\nthe name of _tin─putty_, and is employed in polishing glass, steel, and\r\nother hard substances. When the heat is very violent, the metal takes\r\nfire, and is converted into a fine white oxide, which is used to render\r\nglass opaque, for the forming of enamel. Oxide of tin is also an\r\nimportant article to dyers. It is employed by them, in large quantities,\r\nto give brightness to such colours as are used in forming scarlets and\r\nother reds: and to precipitate the colouring matter of other dyes.\r\n\r\nTin is an essential ingredient in _bell─metal_, _bronze_, _pewter_, and\r\nvarious other compounds. It may be combined with lead, in any\r\nproportion, by fusion; and this alloy is harder, and possesses much more\r\ntenacity than tin. The hardest alloy is a composition of three parts of\r\ntin and one of lead. The presence of the tin destroys, in a great\r\nmeasure, the noxious qualities of the lead. It is sometimes customary to\r\ntin copper vessels with this mixture, and it has been ascertained that\r\nsuch vessels are in no respects injurious.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of _pewter_ in common use. These are called\r\n_plate_, _trifle_, and _ley pewter_. The first, which is made into\r\nplates and dishes, is formed of tin, with a small proportion of lead and\r\nantimony (245). The second, or _trifle pewter_, which is made in\r\nsomewhat different proportions, is used for the quart and pint pots of\r\nthe publicans: and the _ley pewter_, which is formed of three parts of\r\ntin and one of lead, is manufactured into wine and spirit measures.\r\n\r\nTin may be beaten into leaves or plates that are much thinner than\r\npaper. But, when it is thus worked, several leaves must be joined\r\ntogether. They then support each other, and yield to the hammer without\r\ntearing. These leaves are used for the silvering of glass globes, and\r\nthe plating of other metals. Those that are used for the silvering of\r\nlooking─glasses are much thicker. The article called _tin─foil_ is an\r\nalloy, consisting generally of two parts of tin and one of lead; and\r\ncapable of being beaten to less than the thousandth part of an inch in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n239. _LEAD is a heavy metal, of pale and livid grey colour when broken,\r\nnot sonorous when pure, very flexible, and so soft that it may be marked\r\nwith the nail. It stains paper or the fingers of a bluish colour, and is\r\nabout eleven times heavier than water._\r\n\r\nT_he most common state in which lead is found is in combination with\r\nsulphur and a small portion of silver. This ore is known by the name of_\r\ngalena, _and is frequently in the form of blackish cubical crystals.\r\nLead is also found in union with arsenic (242) and many acids._\r\n\r\nGreat Britain possesses the most important lead─mines in the world; and\r\nthose that are best known are in the counties of Flint and Derby. The\r\nlatter are supposed to have been worked even in the time of the Romans.\r\n\r\nLead mines are entered sometimes by perpendicular shafts, and sometimes\r\n(when in the sides of hills) by levels. In some of the Derbyshire mines,\r\nwhere the depth of the veins will admit of it, the men work, at\r\ndifferent heights, of from four to six feet above each other, along what\r\nare called stoops; the uppermost men being two or three yards before\r\nthose next in succession, and thus forming a kind of steps. The\r\nimplements used are picks, hammers, and strong iron wedges; and the\r\nrocks are also frequently loosened by means of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nWhen the ore is brought out of the mine, it is sorted and washed, to\r\nfree it from dirt and rubbish. After this it is spread on a board; the\r\nbest pieces are picked out and separated; and those containing ore mixed\r\nwith spar (194) or other substances, are placed separate, to be broken,\r\nand again picked. After the ore, by pickings and washing, has been\r\nsufficiently cleansed from extraneous matters, it is roasted in a kind\r\nof kiln to free it from the sulphur that is combined with it. The next\r\nprocess is to mix it with a certain quantity of coke, charcoal, or peat,\r\nand submit it to the smelting furnace. In this furnace there are\r\ntap─holes, which, when the lead is melted, are opened, and the metal, in\r\na fluid state, runs into a large iron pan. The dross which floats on its\r\nsurface is now skimmed off; and the metal is taken out by ladles, and\r\npoured into cast iron moulds, with round ends. The lead thus formed, is\r\nready for use, and has the name of _pig lead_. According to their size,\r\nthe pieces that are thus cast have the appellation of _pigs_, and\r\n_half─pigs_.\r\n\r\nLead is mentioned in the Sacred Writings; and is described by Homer as\r\nin common use at the period of the Trojan war. The ancients seem to have\r\nconsidered it as nearly allied to tin. The Romans employed it to sheathe\r\nthe bottoms of their ships, fastening it to the planks and timbers by\r\nnails made of bronze.\r\n\r\nWhen first melted, lead is bright, but it soon tarnishes by exposure to\r\nthe air. It melts at a temperature very low in comparison with most\r\nother metals; and when a strong heat is applied, it boils and\r\nevaporates.\r\n\r\nLead is much employed in the useful arts. When rolled between iron\r\ncylinders to a requisite state of thinness and uniformity, it is used\r\nfor the covering of houses and churches, notwithstanding the danger, in\r\ncase of fire, to persons within, who are exposed to a shower of burning\r\nmetal. It is cast into pipes, cisterns, and reservoirs for water, as\r\nwell as into large boilers for chemical purposes. But all culinary or\r\ndomestic vessels made of lead, particularly if intended for the keeping\r\nof acid liquors, should carefully be avoided, as the surface of the lead\r\nis thereby corroded, and the liquid contained in them is rendered\r\npoisonous. Hence arises that dreadful complaint, too well known where\r\ncyder is kept in leaden cisterns, called the _Devonshire colic_; hence\r\nalso the injury which sometimes follows from the use of lead in the\r\nglazing of coarse earthenware.\r\n\r\nGreat quantities of lead are consumed for the making of _shot_. For this\r\npurpose the metal is alloyed with arsenic (242), to render it more\r\nbrittle; and to render the grains more round and perfect than they\r\notherwise would be. Shot is formed by dropping the melted alloy into\r\nwater, through an iron or copper frame, perforated with round holes,\r\naccording to the size required. For the smallest shot the elevation is\r\nabout ten feet above the water; and for the largest about a hundred and\r\nfifty feet.\r\n\r\nAn alloy of lead and tin, in the proportion of two parts of lead and one\r\nof tin, forms the _solder_ which is used by plumbers. The _types_ that\r\nare used by printers for very large characters are sometimes composed of\r\nan alloy of lead and copper. Lead is also used, with tin, in the\r\nmanufacture of _pewter_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Oxides of Lead._\r\n\r\nThe different oxides (21) of lead are easily soluble in oil, and\r\nconsequently are of great use to painters. Of these the following are\r\nthe most important:\r\n\r\n_White Lead_, or _Ceruse_.—This is made by suspending thin plates of\r\nlead over heated vinegar, in such manner that the vapour which rises\r\nfrom the acid may circulate about the plates. By this process the plates\r\nbecome at length entirely corroded, and converted into a heavy white\r\npowder. The manufacture of white lead is a most unhealthy trade, and is\r\nconfined to a few persons, who have large conveniences for the purpose.\r\nThis substance, when mixed with oil, is used as a paint for wood─work\r\nboth of the outsides and insides of buildings. The fumes that are\r\nemitted from white paint are extremely noxious. Persons who breathe them\r\nare frequently seized with pains, and experience symptoms not much\r\nunlike those that precede palsy; and the danger which attends the\r\ninhabiting of apartments recently painted is well known. The odour of\r\nvinegar will correct the pernicious effect of these exhalations, by\r\nacting as a solvent, and combining with, and precipitating them. We are\r\ninformed that white lead, dangerous as it is, was in great request among\r\nthe Roman ladies as a cosmetic. It is sometimes used as an external\r\napplication for ulcers and other kinds of sores.\r\n\r\n_Massicot_ is a mineral substance of yellow colour, used for painting,\r\nand prepared from the dross or pellicle that is formed by the melting of\r\nlead.\r\n\r\n_Red Lead_, or _Minium_, is a mineral substance of red colour, used for\r\npainting, and made, by a tedious and troublesome process, from massicot.\r\nFor this purpose the massicot is ground to a fine powder, put into a\r\nfurnace, and constantly stirred, whilst the flame of the burning coals\r\nplays against its surface for about forty─eight hours, when it is\r\nconverted into a red powder, which is the article under consideration.\r\nIt is subsequently passed through very fine iron sieves. The use of red\r\nlead as a pigment is well known; but as it is liable to turn black,\r\nvermilion is generally preferred to it. It is sometimes employed in\r\nmedicine as an external application for abating inflammations, for\r\ncleansing and healing ulcers, and the like; and is used in the\r\nmanufacture of glass.\r\n\r\n_Litharge_ is another kind of oxide of lead. This is prepared by\r\nexposing calcined lead to a brisk fire for a certain length of time. The\r\nsubstance, on cooling, concretes into a flaky matter. Litharge is used\r\nby potters for the glazing of earthenware, but vessels that are glazed\r\nwith it are thereby rendered unwholesome. It is also employed, in the\r\ncomposition of the finer kinds of glass, for the purpose, not only of\r\ngiving them greater transparency, but also of rendering them capable of\r\nsustaining sudden changes from heat to cold, and of giving to them a\r\nsusceptibility of being cut without breaking. It, however, adds\r\nconsiderably to the weight of the glass.\r\n\r\n_Litharge Plaster_, or _Diachylon Plaster_, as it is more frequently\r\ncalled, is prepared by boiling two pints of olive oil with one pint of\r\nlitharge, adding water, and constantly stirring the mixture till they\r\nare duly incorporated. This plaster is applied in excoriations of the\r\nskin, slight wounds, and other sores.\r\n\r\n_Sugar of Lead_ is a preparation either from the metal itself, or from\r\nwhite lead and distilled vinegar. It is usually observed in the form of\r\nsmall slender crystals, which have a glossy appearance like satin. This\r\nsubstance is employed, in considerable quantity, by dyers and calico\r\nprinters; and is the basis of a liquid frequently used in medicine,\r\ncalled _Goulard_, or _Goulard’s Extract_. Although in itself a most\r\nvirulent poison, it is often used by unprincipled dealers for correcting\r\nthe rancidity of oil of almonds and olive oil; and a similar pernicious\r\nfraud is practised by dissolving a portion of it in wines which are\r\nbecoming acid, in order to correct their acidity. These frauds, however,\r\nare easily detected by preparations or tests, which are sold by chemists\r\nfor that purpose. Perhaps the best and simplest test is Harrowgate\r\nwater: a little of this poured into the suspected compound will discover\r\nthe presence of lead by giving to the fluid a dark brown or blackish\r\ntinge.\r\n\r\nThe following is a pleasing experiment. Dissolve an ounce of sugar of\r\nlead in about a quart of water; filter the solution through a piece of\r\nblotting paper, and put it into a glass decanter, suspending in it a\r\npiece of zinc by a brass wire. A decomposition will take place; the lead\r\nwill be set at liberty, and will attach itself to the zinc, forming\r\nthere a sort of metallic tree.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that silver is usually a component part of lead ore.\r\nTo disengage this, where the quantity is sufficient to repay the\r\nexpense, the lead, after it has been smelted, is subjected to the action\r\nof what is called a refining furnace. A continued blast of fresh air is\r\nthrown upon its surface by means of large bellows, while the lead is\r\nkept in a state as intensely hot as possible. This by degrees converts\r\nthe lead into a yellow scaly oxide or dross. The oxide, thus formed, is\r\ndriven off from the melted metal as it rises, and the silver is left\r\nalone at the bottom, in a metallic state. After the operation is\r\ncomplete, the oxide is fused with charcoal, and again reduced to\r\nmetallic lead.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention that, in some of the mines of Derbyshire,\r\nthere is a singular variety of lead ore called _slickenside_. This is a\r\nkind of galena, which presents, to the eye, a smooth and bright surface,\r\nappearing as if it were plated. Sometimes it forms the sides of\r\ncavities; and it has the extraordinary property, when merely pierced\r\nwith the miner’s tool, of rending with great violence, and exploding\r\nwith a crackling noise. Some miners, fearless of danger, venture to\r\nscratch it with their tools; and, on coming again to the spot, they\r\noften find that, during their absence, the slickenside has exploded, and\r\nfallen off in considerable quantity. Sometimes, however, they suffer for\r\ntheir imprudence. Mr. Mawe, in his account of the Mineralogy of\r\nDerbyshire, says, that he has seen a man come out of a mine cut\r\nviolently, as if he had been stabbed about the neck and in other parts\r\nof the body, in consequence of the explosion of slickenside which he had\r\npierced. The cause of this extraordinary phenomenon has not been\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n240. _NICKEL, when pure, is a fine white metal, somewhat resembling\r\nsilver in appearance, but it is attracted by the magnet, and has itself\r\nthe property of attracting iron._\r\n\r\n_It is ductile and malleable, difficult of fusion, and about nine times\r\nheavier than water. This metal is always mixed with arsenic (242) and\r\niron._\r\n\r\nNickel is found in Cornwall, and in some other counties of England; in\r\nGermany, Sweden, France, Spain, and several parts of Asia. The Chinese\r\nemploy it in making white copper; and, in conjunction with copper and\r\nzinc, they manufacture it into various kinds of children’s toys. Nickel\r\ngives a certain degree of whiteness to iron. It is used, with advantage,\r\nby some of the Birmingham manufacturers, in combination with that metal,\r\nand by others in combination with brass. If it were possible to discover\r\nan easy method of working nickel, there can be little doubt but it would\r\nbe found a very valuable metal for surgical instruments, for compass\r\nneedles, and other articles, as it is not, like iron, liable to rust.\r\nWhen nickel is freely suspended, it points to the north and south, in\r\nprecisely the same manner as the common magnetic needle.\r\n\r\nOxide of nickel is used for giving colours to enamels and porcelain. In\r\ndifferent mixtures it produces brown, red, and grass─green tints.\r\n\r\n241. _ZINC, or SPELTER, as it is sometimes called, is a bluish white\r\nmetal formed in thin plates adhering together. It has a very perceptible\r\ntaste, is about seven times heavier than water, rather harder than\r\nsilver; and possesses but a small degree of malleability and ductility,\r\nexcept under certain circumstances._\r\n\r\n_This metal is never found in a pure state; and the principal ores from\r\nwhich it is procured are known by the names of_ Calamine _and_ Blende.\r\n_Of these the former is an oxide (21) of zinc combined with carbonic\r\nacid (26), and the latter is a combination of zinc with sulphuric acid\r\n(24)._\r\n\r\nThe ores of zinc are very abundant in many countries. We are informed\r\nthat nearly the whole of Flintshire in North Wales abounds with\r\ncalamine; and that, so entirely ignorant were the inhabitants of its\r\nuse, as, till after the middle of the eighteenth century, to have even\r\nmended their roads with it. These roads, however, have since been turned\r\nup in many places, and the materials have been converted to more\r\nvaluable purposes. Derbyshire affords a great quantity of the ores of\r\nzinc, particularly calamine. This is found at various depths, generally\r\nin beds of yellow, or reddish brown clay, and usually near some vein of\r\nlead ore.\r\n\r\nThe mode of extracting zinc from its ore is by distillation. The process\r\nadopted, in some parts of Saxony, is equally simple and ingenious. An\r\ninclined stone is placed near the anterior part of a furnace, in which\r\nthe ore of lead containing zinc is fused. A great part of the zinc\r\ncondenses upon this stone, and flows, in drops or globules, into a\r\nquantity of charcoal placed at the bottom to receive it. These globules\r\nare afterwards again melted, to run the metal into a mass.\r\n\r\nWhen exposed to the air, the surface of zinc is soon tarnished, but it\r\nscarcely undergoes any other change. It has a certain degree of\r\nductility. When heated a little above 218° of Fahrenheit, it is\r\nmalleable; and, when annealed, may be passed through rollers, and formed\r\ninto thin sheets or leaves. Although, previously to being thus heated,\r\nit is brittle; on now cooling, it continues soft, flexible, and ductile.\r\nThe inconvenience arising from the brittleness of the zinc being\r\nremoved, this metal is applicable to many useful purposes. It may even\r\nbe drawn into wire, but the tenacity of this is not great: a piece of\r\nzinc wire, one tenth of an inch in diameter, will sustain only a weight\r\nof twenty─six pounds without breaking. It has been proposed to\r\nsubstitute zinc in the place of tin for the lining of copper vessels;\r\nbut it has not hitherto been ascertained whether this can be done with\r\neffect, and without injury. Prizes have of late been offered, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, in France, for the ascertainment of this fact. In\r\nChina, zinc is employed as a current coin of the country; and for this\r\npurpose it is used in the utmost purity. The Chinese also, as well as\r\nthe artists of our own country, employ it to a great extent in various\r\nalloys. It is used in the manufacture of _brass_, _pinchbeck_ or\r\n_prince’s metal_, and _bronze_, all of which consist of this metal in\r\ncombination with different proportions of copper (230). _Tutenag_ is a\r\nwell known white metal, made principally of zinc, and used for forming\r\ncandlesticks and other articles. When tutenag is well manufactured, it\r\nis of good colour, and not more disposed to tarnish than silver. Zinc is\r\none of the metals employed to form the galvanic or voltaic apparatus;\r\nand its filings are mixed with gunpowder, to produce those brilliant\r\nstars and spangles which are seen in the best kinds of artificial\r\nfire─works. Preparations of zinc are occasionally used in medicine. If a\r\nthin plate of zinc be applied to the upper surface of the tongue, and a\r\nshilling to the lower surface, and both metals, after a little while, be\r\nbrought into contact, a very peculiar taste will, at that instant, be\r\nperceived. The same sensation will be perceived, though in a weaker\r\ndegree, if the silver be placed at the top and the zinc at the bottom.\r\n\r\nIf a silver probe be introduced high up one of the nostrils, and be\r\nbrought into contact with a piece of zinc placed on the tongue, a\r\nsensation not unlike that of a strong flash of light will be produced in\r\nthe corresponding eye. A similar perception will result, both at the\r\nmoment of contact and that of separation, if one of the metals be\r\napplied as high as possible between the gums and upper lip, and the\r\nother in a similar situation with the under lip, or even under the\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nA white oxide (21) prepared from zinc, was, some years ago, proposed as\r\na substitute for white lead in house painting. This oxide is not\r\ndangerous in its application; and does not become yellow when mixed with\r\noil. But these advantages are counterbalanced by some defects, which\r\nhave hitherto caused it to be rejected. It is lighter than white lead:\r\ndoes not cover the surface so equally, nor so well; and is of\r\nconsiderably higher price.\r\n\r\nCALAMINE.—The principal use of calamine is in the manufacture of brass\r\n(230); and the mines of Derbyshire, and of Limbourg in the Netherlands,\r\nsupply with this mineral nearly all the brass works in Europe. After the\r\ncalamine is dug out of ground, it is reduced to pieces not in general\r\nlarger than a nut. It is then roasted for five or six hours, in what is\r\ncalled a reverberating furnace. The large pieces are separated, and the\r\nsmall ones are passed through a sieve. It is washed; and, when dry, is\r\nground in a mill. In this state it is sold. The principal demand for it\r\nis at Birmingham, for the different brass founderies in that town.\r\n\r\nThe use of calamine in the composition of brass was known at a very\r\nearly period. It is mentioned by Aristotle, who also makes a distinction\r\nbetween the compound resulting from the mixture of copper and calamine\r\nor brass, and that resulting from the mixture of copper and tin or\r\nbronze.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ORDER II.—BRITTLE METALS,\r\n\r\n\r\nOR SUCH AS ARE NOT CAPABLE OF BEING FLATTENED OR ELONGATED BY THE HAMMER\r\n  WITHOUT TEARING OR BREAKING.\r\n\r\n242. ARSENIC, _in a metallic state, has a bluish white colour, and\r\nconsiderable brilliancy; it is remarkably brittle, is the softest of all\r\nknown metals, and is somewhat more than eight times heavier than water._\r\n\r\n_It is found nearly pure, and in considerable abundance, in different\r\nparts of Germany; usually occurring in masses of various shapes, and in\r\ncombination with a small portion of iron, gold, or silver._\r\n\r\n_The arsenic sold in the shops, and too well known for its poisonous\r\nqualities, is an oxide (21) of this metal artificially prepared._\r\n\r\nIn some mines on the Continent arsenic is very abundant, and is found\r\nextremely injurious to the workmen. Being very volatile, its fumes\r\naffect and destroy the lungs, and occasion death in a short time to many\r\nof them. One of its ores, _arsenical pyrites_, is found abundantly in\r\nCornwall and Devonshire, accompanying ores of copper and tin; and, in\r\ncombination with other metals, it occurs, in a greater or less\r\nproportion, in almost all mines.\r\n\r\nArsenic is occasionally used in the arts. It is employed in various\r\nmetallic combinations where a white colour is required, and,\r\nparticularly, for the whitening or bleaching of copper, which is thereby\r\nalso rendered capable of taking a fine polish; hence its use in many of\r\nthe compositions for the mirrors of reflecting telescopes, and for other\r\noptical instruments. The manufacturers of glass frequently employ the\r\noxides of arsenic in the fabrication of that article. Arsenic is used in\r\nthe processes of dyeing and calico printing; and for the imparting of\r\ndifferent artificial shades and colours to furs. It is also used in the\r\nmanufacture of small shot, from its rendering the lead more brittle, and\r\nbetter capable of being formed into grains, than it would be without\r\nsuch admixture.\r\n\r\nThe arsenic of commerce is prepared to a great extent in Bohemia and\r\nSaxony, by roasting cobalt ores for the manufacture of zaffre (247).\r\n_White arsenic_ is made, by mixing the common oxide with potash, and\r\nsubmitting it to a certain degree of heat, in vessels adapted to the\r\npurpose; the arsenic, rising in fumes, is separated, leaving the sulphur\r\nbehind, united to the potash. This process is called sublimation.\r\n\r\nOf all substances with which we are acquainted this is perhaps the most\r\ndeadly. If only a few grains of it be taken into the stomach, it proves\r\nfatal; and it has frequently proved the more injurious from its\r\ndeceitful appearance, in which it somewhat resembles salt or white\r\nsugar. Carelessly left in places open to the access of children, arsenic\r\nhas not unfrequently been mistaken by them for sugar, and has been\r\nattended with the most dreadful consequences. If thrown on heated coals,\r\nhowever, it is immediately known, by the smell of garlic, and the white\r\nfumes which it gives out. The best remedy for this poison is said to be\r\na few scruples of liver of sulphur (sulphuret of potash), dissolved in\r\nhalf a pint or a pint of water, and administered a little at a time, as\r\nthe patient can bear it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its deleterious qualities, arsenic is occasionally used\r\nin medicine, though in extremely small doses; and it has, in particular,\r\nbeen found efficacious in many cases of intermittent fever.\r\n\r\nIt is employed as a poison for rats and mice; and, diluted with water,\r\nit attracts and poisons flies, whence it is sometimes called by the\r\nFrench, _poudre a mouches_. There cannot, however, be too great caution\r\nused either in the preparation, or in the application, of this fatal\r\npoison.\r\n\r\n243. _YELLOW ORPIMENT is a mineral substance of lemon colour, which\r\nconsists of arsenic in combination with sulphur; and in the proportion\r\nof about fifty─seven parts of the former and forty─three of the latter._\r\n\r\n_It is about thrice as heavy as water; and is found both in a massive\r\nand crystallized state; but the crystals are so confused that their\r\nfigures cannot easily be determined._\r\n\r\nThe orpiment of commerce is an artificial production, and is chiefly\r\nimported from different parts of the Levant. The Turks, and other\r\nOrientals, use it in the depilatories which serve to render bald the top\r\nof the head. A very beautiful, but fugitive pigment, called _King’s\r\nyellow_, is prepared from this mineral; and other preparations of\r\norpiment are occasionally used by painters, and also by dyers and calico\r\nprinters. The whole of these, however, are extremely poisonous.\r\n\r\nOrpiment is found in a natural state, along with copper and other ores,\r\nin Natolia, Servia, Hungary, Turkey, and some other countries.\r\n\r\n244. _REALGAR, or RED ORPIMENT, is a mineral substance of red or orange\r\ncolour, which consists of arsenic in combination with sulphur; and in\r\nthe proportion of seventy─five parts of the former, and twenty─five of\r\nthe latter._\r\n\r\n_It is somewhat more than three times as heavy as water; and occurs\r\nsometimes in a crystallized, and sometimes in a massive or disseminated\r\nstate._\r\n\r\nThis production, which, by ignorant persons, is not unfrequently\r\nmistaken for red lead, is in considerable request by painters, dyers,\r\nand calico printers. In China it is manufactured into small pagodas and\r\nother ornaments. And the Chinese form it into medical cups, and use\r\nlemon juice which has stood for some hours in them, as a cathartic.\r\nRealgar is poisonous, but by no means so much so as arsenic (242).\r\n\r\nIt is found in Sicily, Hungary, and various parts of Germany: and is\r\nvery common in several districts of China.\r\n\r\n245. _ANTIMONY is a compact metallic substance of brilliant and slightly\r\nbluish white colour, destitute of ductility, and about seven times\r\nheavier than water._\r\n\r\n_Its texture is laminated, the plates crossing each other in almost\r\nevery different direction. It is as hard as silver, and so brittle that\r\nit may easily be reduced to powder, in a mortar._\r\n\r\nIn the state of the Connecticut, North America, it is said that\r\nantimony, in a pure metallic form, is found in such abundance that, in\r\nsome places, large masses of it may be seen lying on the surface of the\r\nground. The principal supply of antimony in Europe is from an ore which\r\nis found in Hungary and Norway, called _sulphuret of antimony_. The\r\nprocess of bringing it into a state for use is very simple. The mineral\r\nis put into pots, each of which has a hole in the bottom, and which is\r\nplaced on another pot bedded in the earth. The upper pots, which are\r\nfilled with the mineral, are heated. As soon as the antimony is fused it\r\nflows into the lower pots, while the substances with which it was\r\ncombined remain in the upper ones. The antimony fixes, and forms cakes\r\nof the shape of the pots which receive it. In this state the metal\r\npresents, in its fracture, a surface thick─set, with long needle─shaped\r\ncrystals, which, lying by the side of each other, compose, as it were,\r\nthe whole of the mass. It is afterwards re─melted and cast into cakes\r\nfor sale.\r\n\r\nThis metal, in a pure state, or alloyed only with a very small portion\r\nof silver and iron, is found in veins of mountains in some parts of\r\nFrance and Sweden, occurring in massive and kidney─shaped lumps of white\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nThe only mine of antimony in Britain, which is of any importance, is at\r\nGlendinning in Dumfries─shire. It was discovered in 1760, in searching\r\nfor lead ore, but was not regularly worked till 1763. In the first five\r\nyears about a hundred tons’ weight of antimony were obtained from it.\r\nThis at 84_l._ per ton, produced the sum of 8400_l._ The undertaking was\r\nafterwards relinquished, but, as the price of antimony is now at least\r\nthrice what it then was, it is supposed that this work, if resumed,\r\nmight prove an advantageous speculation. The vein of ore is only from\r\neight inches to a foot and a half in thickness.\r\n\r\nAntimony was known to the ancients. The earliest account we have of it\r\nis in the Sacred Writings. The passage in the Second Book of Kings,[4]\r\nwhich states that, on the approach of Jehu to the city of Jezreel,\r\n“Jezebel painted her face,” implies, in the original, that she stained\r\nher eyes and eyebrows with antimony, for the purpose of making them look\r\nblack and large, a custom which, at that period, was prevalent in\r\nseveral of the Eastern countries. Antimony was likewise considered by\r\nthe ancients a remedy against inflammations of the eyes.\r\n\r\nThis metal is the basis of many of the officinal preparations which are\r\nnow in use; and it was the basis of many others which were formerly\r\nused, but are now discontinued. No mineral substance has so much\r\nattracted the attention, or so much divided the opinion of physicians,\r\nas antimony. One party extolled it as an infallible specific for almost\r\nevery disease; whilst another described it as a virulent poison, which\r\nought to be expunged from the list of medicines. It was on this metal\r\nthat the alchemists of the middle ages principally founded their hope of\r\ndiscovering the philosopher’s stone; and, by a kind of good fortune, of\r\nwhich we can cite but few examples, it has happened that, in pursuing a\r\nchimera, they hit upon a succession of important realities. To the\r\nunremitted perseverance with which they tormented this metal, if we may\r\nso express it, the art of healing has been most essentially indebted.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Ch. ix. v. 30. See also Ezek. Ch. xxiii. v. 40.\r\n\r\nThe first rational account of the properties of antimony was given,\r\nabout the end of the seventeenth century, by a French chemist, whose\r\nname was Lemeri. Its great importance in medicine will be seen by an\r\nenumeration of some of the most valuable preparations of it which are\r\nstill in use.\r\n\r\n_Antimonial Wine_ is prepared from antimony, in conjunction with white\r\nLisbon wine. It is employed as an emetic; but, if mixed with milk, this\r\nquality is said to be completely destroyed, and it becomes narcotic.\r\n\r\n_Emetic Tartar_, which is much more employed in this country than all\r\nthe other antimonial preparations put together, is formed from antimony\r\nmixed with its own weight of tartar, and a certain proportion of water,\r\nand afterwards boiled, filtered, and suffered to crystallize.\r\n\r\n_Butter of Antimony_ is obtained from a combination of antimony with\r\ncorrosive sublimate. It is denominated by chemists muriat of antimony,\r\nand is usually a thick fatty mass of greyish white colour.\r\n\r\n_Glass of Antimony_ is a vitreous substance of reddish brown colour,\r\nwhich is occasionally used in medicine, but more frequently in colouring\r\nthe imitations of yellow diamond, Oriental, Brazil, and Saxon topaz,\r\nhyacinth, emerald, and beryl.\r\n\r\n_James’s Powder_, or _Antimonial Powder_, is a well─known medicine,\r\ncomposed of phosphat of lime and antimony.\r\n\r\nAn alloy consisting of sixteen parts of lead and one part of antimony\r\nconstitutes the metal of which _printers’ types_ are formed. This alloy\r\ndoes not differ from lead except in being considerably harder and more\r\ntenacious. The plates on which music is engraved are formed of a mixture\r\nof tin and antimony; and the oxides of antimony are used for the\r\ncolouring of glass.\r\n\r\n246. _BISMUTH is a reddish white semi─metal, harder than silver, and\r\ncomposed of broad brilliant plates adhering together._\r\n\r\n_It is nearly ten times heavier than water, and is so brittle as readily\r\nto break under the hammer. None of the semi─metals are so easy to be\r\nfused as this; it melts even in the flame of a wax candle, and long\r\nbefore it becomes red hot, and has the singular property of expanding as\r\nit cools._\r\n\r\nThe ores of bismuth chiefly occur in Sweden, Norway, Germany, France,\r\nand England. This metal appears to have been known to the ancients. It\r\nwas confounded by them with tin; and, even in our own manufactories, it\r\nis known to the workmen by the name of _tin─glass_.\r\n\r\nIt is not of much use in the arts; but its fusibility renders the\r\nworking of it very simple and easy. It is employed in the composition of\r\nsome of the soft kinds of solder; and is also used for giving hardness\r\nto tin and other metals. Amalgamated with mercury it renders that metal\r\nless fluid; and the addition of it to mercury and tin is found useful in\r\nthe foliating or silvering of looking─glasses. Some manufacturers use it\r\nin the composition of pewter; but it is said that this ought not to be\r\ndone, particularly for the formation of vessels intended to contain\r\nfood, as bismuth partakes of the noxious properties of lead, and\r\nsometimes contains even arsenic. It is also occasionally employed in the\r\nfabrication of printers’ types.\r\n\r\nA very singular metal is formed by melting together eight parts of\r\nbismuth, five of lead, and three of tin. Tea─spoons formed of this metal\r\nsurprise all who are unacquainted with their nature: they have somewhat\r\nthe appearance of common spoons, but they melt as soon as they are put\r\ninto boiling water.\r\n\r\nBismuth reduced to powder, mixed with the white of eggs and applied to\r\nwood, gives it, when gradually dried and rubbed with a polisher, the\r\nappearance of being silvered. If this metal be dissolved in aquafortis\r\n(30), and water be poured into the solution, a white powder\r\nprecipitates, which is an oxide of bismuth, and which, after being well\r\nwashed, is used as a pigment, under the name of _pearl─white_. From its\r\nbeautiful appearance, this powder is sometimes employed by ladies for\r\npainting their skin; a practice which cannot be too much condemned, both\r\non account of the danger with which it is attended, and from its soon\r\ninjuring both the texture and natural colour of the skin. It has the\r\nfurther disadvantage of turning black when touched by the fumes of fetid\r\nand other substances; and ladies, who have used this cosmetic, and have\r\nafterwards bathed in the Harrowgate waters, have come from the bath a\r\nperfectly tawny colour. It was probably the oxide of bismuth which the\r\nRoman ladies used for whitening their skin; for Martial, in speaking of\r\na lady, who made too free an use of cosmetics, describes her as afraid\r\neven of the sun. The oxide of bismuth is used in the composition of most\r\nof the pomades employed in France for painting the face.\r\n\r\nA preparation of bismuth has lately been employed in medicine, as a\r\nremedy against spasmodic affections of the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe following is a pleasing experiment, illustrative of metallic\r\ncrystallization. Melt a ladleful of bismuth, and allow it to cool slowly\r\nand quietly till a thin crust is formed on the surface: then, with a\r\npointed iron, make two small opposite apertures through the crust: and,\r\nthrough one of these, quickly pour out the fluid portion, as carefully\r\nand with as little motion of the mass as possible. The air having\r\nentered by the other aperture, there will appear, on removing the upper\r\ncrust by means of a chisel, when the vessel has become cold, a\r\ncup─shaped concavity, studded with very brilliant crystals, and more or\r\nless regular according to the quantity of metal employed, the\r\ntranquillity and slowness with which it has cooled, and the dexterity\r\nwith which the fluid portion of the mass was poured off before it became\r\nsolid. The same effect may be produced by melting bismuth in a crucible\r\nwhich has a hole in the bottom, lightly closed by an iron rod or\r\nstopper; this is to be drawn out when the mass begins to congeal. By so\r\ndoing, the upper portion, which is fluid, is made to run off, and a cake\r\nstudded with crystals will be left.\r\n\r\n\r\n247. _COBALT is a semi─metal of grey colour with a shade of red,\r\nbrittle, somewhat harder than silver, nearly eight times as heavy as\r\nwater, is attracted by the magnet, and is itself capable of being\r\nrendered permanently magnetical._\r\n\r\n_The ores of cobalt are not numerous, and are, for the most part,\r\ncombinations of this substance with other metals, or of its oxides (24)\r\nwith arsenic, or with sulphuric acid (21)._\r\n\r\nThe name of this metal implies an evil being, (_Kobold_, German, goblin)\r\nand is said to have been given on account of the vapour of arsenic,\r\nwhich issues from it, tormenting the miners, and making them believe\r\nthat they are afflicted by wicked spirits. Hence it was once customary\r\nin Germany to introduce into the church service a prayer that God would\r\npreserve miners and their works from _cobalts_ and _spirits_.\r\n\r\nCobalt is found in several parts of Europe, but most plentifully in the\r\nsouthern borders of France, and in Saxony; and the cobalt ores of Hesse,\r\nalthough they were formerly used for no other purpose than the mending\r\nof roads, are said now to yield a clear profit of nearly 15,000_l._ a\r\nyear. Some parts of our own country yield this substance in considerable\r\nabundance, particularly the Mendip Hills in Somersetshire, and a mine\r\nnear Penzance in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nAfter the ore is taken from the earth, it is broken into pieces about\r\nthe size of a hen’s egg, and the stony parts are picked out. The sorted\r\nmineral is then pounded in mills, and sifted through brass─wire sieves.\r\nThe lighter particles are next carried off by water. After undergoing\r\nsome other preparations, to rid it of the impurities and foreign matters\r\nwith which it is connected, it appears in the form of a dark grey oxide.\r\nThe working of the cobalt ores in Germany is considered so injurious, on\r\naccount of the arsenic with which they are combined, that much of the\r\nlabour is performed by criminals who are condemned to it for the\r\ncommission of crimes which, by the laws of the country, have deserved\r\nthe punishment of death.\r\n\r\nAs a metal, cobalt was unknown till the year 1733, when it was\r\ndiscovered by a celebrated Swedish chemist whose name was Brant. In its\r\nmetallic state it is not employed in the useful arts; but in a state of\r\noxide it is found extremely valuable in the colouring of porcelain, in\r\npainting, enamelling, and for other purposes. Cobalt and ultramarine\r\nform the most permanent blue colours with which we are acquainted. The\r\nold painters generally used them for the representation of the sky and\r\nof blue drapery, and this is the reason why these parts in some old\r\npictures have been found so much more durable than any others.\r\n\r\n_Zaffre_ is an oxide of cobalt mixed with about three times its own\r\nweight of calcined and pounded flint. It has been chiefly imported into\r\nthis country from Saxony and Bohemia, but it is now also manufactured\r\nfrom cobalt dug from mines in the Mendip Hills and in Cornwall. In\r\nStaffordshire there are several persons who carry on a considerable\r\ntrade in preparing this colour for the earthenware manufacturers of that\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThis substance is extremely valuable for the colouring of porcelain and\r\nglass; as it resists without change, the effects of the most intense\r\nheat. Hence also it is advantageously used for giving various shades of\r\nblue to enamels, and to glass manufactured in imitation of lapis lazuli,\r\nturquoise, sapphire, and various precious stones. So intense is the\r\ncolour imparted by it that a single grain of zaffre will give a full\r\nblue tint to 240 grains of glass.\r\n\r\n_Smalt_ is a kind of glass, of dark blue colour, formed by melting\r\nzaffre with three parts of sand and one of potash; when this substance\r\nis ground to a coarse powder, it has the name of _strewing─smalt_, and\r\nis much used by sign painters, as an ornamental filling up of the vacant\r\nspace betwixt the letters of signs. In Germany it is frequently employed\r\ninstead of sand for the purpose of drying ink after writing. The same\r\nsubstance reduced to a perfectly fine or impalpable powder, is the\r\narticle which is sold under the name of _powder─blue_, and which is not\r\nonly used by laundresses and others in the getting up of linen, but also\r\nas the basis of several kinds of paint; and by the manufacturers of\r\nwriting and printing papers, to give a blue tinge to those articles.\r\n\r\nA solution of the oxide of cobalt in spirit of salt (muriatic acid, 29)\r\nand afterwards diluted till nearly the whole of its colour disappears,\r\nforms one of the most beautiful _sympathetic inks_ with which we are\r\nacquainted. If a landscape be drawn with Indian ink, and, afterwards,\r\nthe foliage be washed over with this solution, it will have no peculiar\r\nappearance; but, on holding the paper near the fire, the part\r\nrepresenting the vegetation will gradually assume a green tint, which\r\nwill subside on removing the paper into a cool situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n248. _MANGANESE, in the state that we usually see it, is a black oxide\r\nof a metal which is of a silvery grey colour, of leafy or foliated\r\ntexture, and somewhat more than six times as heavy as water._\r\n\r\nMines of manganese have long been worked in several parts of Great\r\nBritain, but particularly in the counties of Devon and Somerset. Near\r\nExeter and in the Mendip Hills this mineral is found in great abundance.\r\n\r\nIt is employed for various useful purposes. In the manufacture of the\r\nfiner kinds of glass it is used in a double capacity, both as a\r\ncolouring material and as a destroyer of colour. As a colouring\r\ningredient, the imitators of several precious stones are indebted to it\r\nfor the red and purple tints which they give to the oriental ruby, the\r\nbalais ruby, and the amethyst.\r\n\r\nThe violet colour given to porcelain is obtained from manganese. This\r\nsubstance is also used for the glazing of black earthen ware, as a\r\npaint, and an ingredient in printers’ ink. As a discharger of colour it\r\nis applied in small quantities, and, by the oxygen which it gives out,\r\nit is said completely to destroy any tinge left in the glass, by the\r\npresence of iron, and some other colouring matters. This property has\r\nobtained for it the appellation of the _soap of glass_.\r\n\r\nIt is from manganese that all the oxygen gas (21) used by chemists is\r\nobtained. By the application of a red heat this is yielded in such\r\nabundance that an ounce of the oxide of this metal will yield about two\r\nquarts of gas. The consumption of manganese has, of late years, become\r\nvery considerable by the discovery of the oxygenated muriatic acid,\r\nwhich is now extensively used in the bleaching of linen and cotton; that\r\nliquor being made by the distillation of the oxide of manganese with\r\nspirit of salt (muriatic acid, 29).\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           COMPOUND MINERALS,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   OR\r\n\r\n                                 ROCKS.\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n\r\n249. There exist considerable masses of minerals in a state of\r\ncombination, or aggregation with each other. These constitute the rocks\r\nand soil of which the globe of the earth is composed; and the study of\r\nthem is called GEOLOGY. The opinions of learned men relative to their\r\nstructure, and original formation, have produced various systems\r\ndenominated _theories of the earth_; but, when we consider that the\r\ngreatest depth beneath the surface to which the art and industry of man\r\nhave been able to penetrate, does not exceed 1/35000 part of the earth’s\r\ndiameter, we must confess that this is very insufficient to allow of any\r\ncorrect opinion being thereby formed concerning the structure of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nModern geologists, for the more convenient arrangement of the compound\r\nminerals, have divided them into four classes, which they denominate\r\n_primitive rocks_, _secondary rocks_, _alluvial depositions_, and\r\n_volcanic rocks_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          I. PRIMITIVE ROCKS.\r\n\r\n250. _These are so called from their being considered by geologists, to\r\nbelong to the first formed parts of the globe._\r\n\r\nRocks of this description are of a nature extremely hard. They contain\r\nno vestiges whatever of animal or organic remains; and the substances of\r\nwhich they are composed are crystallized. They rise through other rocks\r\nat various elevations, in every quarter of the globe; and never either\r\nalternate with, or rest upon rocks that enclose organic remains, though\r\nthey are themselves frequently covered by such.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal kinds.\r\n\r\n251. _GRANITE or moonstone is a compound rock composed of felspar (110),\r\nquartz (76), and mica (123), each in crystalline grains of various size,\r\nand promiscuously arranged; sometimes one and sometimes the other of\r\nthese ingredients predominates, but generally the felspar._\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most common and most widely extended rocks that are\r\nknown; and is considered as the foundation on which the secondary rocks\r\nare deposited. In Cornwall it is very abundant, and veins both of copper\r\nand tin are found in it. Granite forms the summits of the highest\r\nmountains in Scotland, of the highest of the Grampian Hills, the Alps,\r\nand the Pyrenees; and indeed the loftiest parts of most of the countries\r\nof the world. The Logan or rocking stones, in Cornwall, are immense\r\nblocks of granite.\r\n\r\nThe uses of this stone are numerous and important. Millstones, steps,\r\ntroughs for stamping mills, and innumerable other articles, are made of\r\nit. The streets of London are chiefly paved with granite, and its\r\nhardness and durability render it peculiarly eligible for this use.\r\nWeather has little effect upon it. Consequently, when applied to\r\narchitectural purposes it is found infinitely preferable to Portland\r\nstone, of which nearly all the public buildings of modern date in London\r\nhave been constructed, and many of which are fast going to decay. This\r\ncircumstance induced the proprietors of the Waterloo Bridge to adopt\r\ngranite in the construction of that edifice. Mr. Smeaton also chose it\r\nfor the outer walls of the Eddystone Lighthouse.\r\n\r\n252. SCOTTISH GRANITE.—Scotland is remarkable for many kinds of granite,\r\nsome of which are susceptible of an excellent polish. The greatest part\r\nof the mountain of Ben Nevis, near Fort William, is composed of a\r\nreddish granite, one of the best and most beautiful that is known. This\r\nmountain is nearly a mile in perpendicular height, and is said to\r\ncontain granite enough for all the kingdoms of the earth, although they\r\nshould be as partial to this stone as the ancient Egyptians were.\r\nColumns and obelisks of any size and height might be cut from it: for\r\nthe rock is one uniform mass, without appearance of strata, division, or\r\nfissure of any kind. A convincing proof has been given of the strength\r\nand hardness of this granite, in a fragment of several tons’ weight,\r\nwhich fell from nearly the top of a precipice five hundred yards in\r\nheight, upon a hard and solid rock below, and yet continued entire.\r\n\r\n253. GRANITE OF INGRIA.—A beautiful red granite is found in some parts\r\nof Russia, remarkable on account of the felspar (110) that it contains,\r\nappearing in round or oval pieces, from half an inch to two inches in\r\ndiameter. This granite, when polished, exhibits shining spots of round\r\nor oval shape, which give to it somewhat the appearance of being studded\r\nwith precious stones.\r\n\r\nThe royal summer garden at Petersburg is decorated with a superb\r\ncolonnade of Ingrian granite. The columns are sixty in number, and each\r\nof a single piece twenty feet high, and three feet in diameter. Many of\r\nthe public buildings in Petersburg are of this granite. An immense block\r\nof it thirty─two feet long, twenty─one feet broad, and seventeen feet\r\nhigh, forms the pedestal of the celebrated equestrian statue of Peter\r\nthe Great, in that city.\r\n\r\n254. GRAPHIC GRANITE.—A singular kind of granite has been discovered in\r\nthe island of Corsica, and lately near Portsoy in the north of Scotland.\r\nThe ground of this granite is a whitish or reddish yellow felspar, in\r\nwhich are embedded crystals of quartz each from an inch to an inch and\r\nhalf long, and several lines in diameter. The name of graphic granite\r\nwas given to it in consequence of an imaginary resemblance which the\r\nsections of these crystals have to Hebrew, or Arabic, and sometimes to\r\nmusical characters.\r\n\r\n255. _GNEISS is a primitive rock, consisting, like granite, of felspar\r\n(110), quartz (76), and mica (123), but differing from that rock in its\r\nstructure, being slaty._\r\n\r\nMountains of gneiss are not so steep as those of granite, and their\r\nsummits are usually rounded. Ben Lomond and others in Scotland, and\r\nmount Rosa in Italy, are almost wholly of gneiss, as well as the middle\r\npart of the Pyrenees. It is not an uncommon rock, but in Britain is of\r\nless frequent occurrence than granite.\r\n\r\nMany valuable metallic ores are found in veins of gneiss. This rock also\r\nsometimes contains crystals of garnet (70), and tourmaline (69).\r\n\r\n256. _MICA SLATE, or MICACEOUS SCHISTUS, is a primitive rock of slaty\r\nstructure, consisting principally of quartz (76) and mica (123)._\r\n\r\nLike gneiss, it is rich in ores. It often contains beds of magnetic\r\nironstone (235), galena (239), copper, blende (241), cinnabar (228), and\r\nsometimes even gold. It frequently has garnets, and sometimes\r\ntourmalines (69), interspersed in different parts of it.\r\n\r\nMica slate occurs in many parts of Scotland; the mountain of\r\nSchehallien, and the rocky adjacent country, are in a great degree\r\ncomposed of it.\r\n\r\n257. _CLAY SLATE is a primitive rock generally of dull blue colour, more\r\nor less compact, always slaty, and always stratified._\r\n\r\nUnder the appellation of clay slate are included _roofing slate_ (120),\r\n_whet slate_ (122), _drawing slate_ (121), and some other kinds already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nFew rocks abound more in veins and beds of valuable metals than slate.\r\nIn different countries it contains ores of tin, lead, cobalt (247),\r\nsilver, and copper; and gold, and mercury (228) sometimes occur in it.\r\nThe celebrated quicksilver mines of Idria (228), and the immense mass of\r\ncopper at Parys mountain in the island of Anglesea (230), are in clay\r\nslate. Crystals of pyrites (236), and sometimes garnets (70), and thin\r\nlayers of quartz (76), and felspar (110), are all occasionally found\r\nembedded in it.\r\n\r\nThis is a widely─extended rock; it sometimes forms whole mountains, and\r\neven chains of mountains; but these usually have a gentle acclivity. The\r\nsummit of the celebrated mountain called Skiddaw in Cumberland is of\r\nclay slate.\r\n\r\n258. _PRIMITIVE LIMESTONE is a simple mountain rock of crystalline or\r\ngranular structure; and generally of white, yellowish, greenish, or\r\nreddish colour._\r\n\r\nTo this species of rock belong many of the rich and beautiful kinds of\r\nmarble already described (143, &c.). Carrara, or statuary marble (146),\r\nis a familiar instance of it. Whole mountains in Stiria, Carinthia,\r\nCarniola, and the Pyrenees, and three mountains in Switzerland, 10,000\r\nfeet in height, are of primitive limestone. The mountain of Filabres in\r\nSpain, is said to consist of one block of white granular marble, 2,000\r\nfeet high, and three miles in circuit; without intermixture of other\r\nearths or stones, and almost without a fissure.\r\n\r\nVarious mineral ores, in beds and veins, as lead, zinc (241), and iron,\r\nare occasionally found in this kind of rock.\r\n\r\n259. _PRIMITIVE TRAP is a mountain rock composed of a black mineral\r\ncalled hornblende, mixed, in some varieties, with felspar (110), and, in\r\nothers, with mica (123)._\r\n\r\nThe word _trap_ is of German origin, signifying a _stair_; and rocks of\r\nthis formation are called trap rocks, because their strata, when\r\nexposed, usually jut out, one beneath the other, somewhat like a stair.\r\nUnder this term is comprehended a series of rocks, distinguished chiefly\r\nby the hornblende, which they all contain.\r\n\r\nRocks belonging to this formation are numerous. They occur in Scotland;\r\nand abundantly in Derbyshire and some other parts of England. In many\r\ncountries they constitute considerable hills. They abound in ores.\r\n\r\n260. _SERPENTINE is a primitive rock, usually consisting of quartz (76),\r\nmagnesia (198), alumine (197), with a portion of oxide (21) of iron._\r\n\r\nThis rock and its various uses, have been already described (132). It\r\ngenerally occurs in shapeless masses and beds; and seldom in distinct\r\nstrata. It is found in Cornwall, the island of Anglesea, and several\r\nparts of Scotland; but it rarely forms mountains.\r\n\r\nOres of lead, silver, and copper, are sometimes found in serpentine.\r\n\r\n261. _PORPHYRY is a primitive rock, consisting of quartz (76) or felspar\r\n(110), or both, embedded in a solid and compact cement or ground._\r\n\r\n_The ground or basis of porphyry varies in the different kinds. In some\r\nit is claystone, in others pitchstone, hornstone, or compact felspar._\r\n\r\nWhen not covered by other formations, porphyry sometimes forms single\r\nrocks; but it never constitutes elevated mountains. It occurs in beds of\r\nconsiderable magnitude, but never appears in distinct and well─defined\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nThere are many beautiful and splendid works in porphyry. Obelisks,\r\nstatues, and columns, wrought in it, have had great celebrity. It is\r\nsusceptible of a polish as high as that of marble, but is so hard, that\r\nthe expense of working it has caused it to be much neglected by the\r\nmoderns. This hardness, however, renders it very durable, and also\r\nconstitutes it a material of great utility for mortars, slabs for\r\ngrinding colours upon, and for several other purposes.\r\n\r\nPorphyry was much esteemed by the ancient Egyptians; and Pliny informs\r\nus that the procurator─general in Egypt, under Claudius Cæsar, brought\r\nthence, for that Emperor, certain statues of porphyry, which he\r\nconceived to be very valuable: this act, however, was not much approved,\r\nand the example was not followed by any other Roman.\r\n\r\nThe principal quarries of porphyry are in Egypt; but this stone is also\r\nfound in Italy, Germany, and various parts of the European continent. It\r\nmay be traced from Norway to the borders of the Black Sea, and it has\r\nbeen discovered in some of the western and northern parts of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n262. _SIENITE is a rock composed chiefly of felspar (110) and\r\nhornblende. Its colours are usually reddish and black._\r\n\r\n_Some varieties of it contain quartz (76) and mica (123), with but\r\nlittle hornblende. In these the colours are various._\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a less abundant rock than any of those that have yet\r\nbeen mentioned, it occurs, in great abundance, at Mount Mado, in the\r\nisland of Jersey. There are extensive quarries of it in that mountain,\r\nnot only for the use of the island, but for exportation to England, and\r\nother distant countries. The cliffs, for a long space, and an elevation\r\nof a hundred feet or more, consist entirely of sienite, in large masses,\r\nwhich are apparently uninterrupted by a single fissure. Shafts for\r\ncolumns of considerable length have been taken from these quarries; and,\r\nwere the demand sufficient to call for new openings, it is imagined that\r\ncolumns of twenty feet and upwards in length might be raised. The\r\nfelspar is of a flesh colour, and the stone is capable of a beautiful\r\npolish.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar kind of sienite is found at Grande Roque, in the\r\nisland of Guernsey, in large masses, which are quarried for building\r\nstones. Sienite also occurs in some parts of Scotland and Derbyshire; in\r\nSaxony, Hungary, the island of Cyprus, and Egypt. Its name has been\r\nderived from that of the city of Syene, in Upper Egypt, where it is\r\nfound in great abundance.\r\n\r\nSienite was much used by the ancients in ornamental architecture. What\r\nwas called the red granite of Egypt (for this rock has usually been\r\nconsidered a granite) furnished numerous magnificent obelisks and\r\ncolumns, of a single piece, which have been much admired in Rome and\r\nother places. The ancient artists sometimes cut this kind of stone into\r\nstatues, vases, monumental and other works. The celebrated column in\r\nEgypt, upwards of ninety feet high, and known by the name of Pompey’s\r\nPillar, is formed of sienite.\r\n\r\nIn veins of this rock are found, in different countries, many kinds of\r\nmetallic ores: among others, silver, iron, tin, copper, and lead.\r\n\r\n263. _QUARTZ ROCK is a simple mountain rock, usually of granular\r\ntexture, and whitish colour._\r\n\r\n_It sometimes contains mica, in which case it has a slaty form._\r\n\r\nIn certain mountains of Scotland, and the Scottish islands, quartz rock\r\nis very abundant. On the Continent it appears in Saxony, Bohemia,\r\nSilesia, and several other countries. We are informed that a mountain,\r\n350 feet high, and near 5000 feet broad and long, one of the Altaisch\r\nchain, in Siberia, consists entirely of a milk─white quartz.\r\n\r\nThe uses of quartz have been already described (76, &c.) This kind of\r\nrock does not contain metallic ores of any description.\r\n\r\n                          II. SECONDARY ROCKS.\r\n\r\n264. SECONDARY ROCKS _are composed of, or at least contain within them,\r\nthe mineralized remains of organic substances_. These must necessarily\r\nhave been formed at a period subsequent to the formation of those\r\norganized bodies the remains of which they enclose; and they have\r\napparently been formed by the deposition of water. Hence it is that, to\r\ndistinguish them from rocks of the preceding class, they have received\r\nthe appellation of secondary. They always rest upon or cover primitive\r\nmountains, and sometimes lean upon their sides or invest them.\r\n\r\nWerner, the celebrated German mineralogist, makes two divisions of\r\nsecondary rocks. The first of these he denominates _transition rocks_,\r\nand states that they are less perfectly crystallized than the primitive\r\nrocks; and that they enclose the remains of marine animals, no species\r\nof which are at this time known to exist: the other division he terms\r\n_floetz_, or _flat rocks_, because they are generally disposed in\r\nhorizontal or flat strata. Some of the latter contain the fossil remains\r\nof marine animals and shells, approaching in character and appearance to\r\nthe kinds which are now found in the ocean; and others contain shells\r\nprecisely similar to those now known to exist. These rocks usually occur\r\nat the foot of primitive mountains, or in deep valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          1. TRANSITION ROCKS.\r\n\r\n265. _TRANSITION LIMESTONE is distinguished by containing marine\r\npetrifactions of corals, and other zoophytes which are supposed no\r\nlonger to exist. It often contains veins of calcareous spar, and\r\nexhibits a variety of colours, which give to it a marbled appearance._\r\n\r\nThis species of limestone occurs in immense beds, and forms a great\r\nportion of the mountainous parts of Derbyshire and Scotland; but it does\r\nnot rise so high, on the sides of mountains, as primitive rocks (250).\r\n\r\nIt often contains veins of valuable metallic ores. When cut and\r\npolished, many of the varieties of transition limestone are beautiful\r\nmarbles; some of them have been already described.\r\n\r\n266. _GREY WACKA is a transition rock, composed of pieces of quartz\r\n(76), flinty slate, felspar (110), and clay slate (120), cemented\r\ntogether by a basis of clay slate._\r\n\r\n_It has various appearances, the pieces being sometimes as large as a\r\nhen’s egg, and sometimes so small that they can scarcely be perceived by\r\nthe naked eye._\r\n\r\nWhen the rocks of grey wacka are not covered by those of any other\r\nformation, they form round─backed hills, usually insulated towards the\r\ntops, and intersected by deep valleys. They are widely distributed: and\r\nare often extremely rich in ores, both in beds and veins. Almost all the\r\nmines of copper, lead, and zinc, in the Hartz, are in grey wacka; and,\r\nin Transylvania, this species of rock is traversed by numerous small\r\nveins of gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       2. FLOETZ, OR FLAT ROCKS.\r\n\r\n267. _OLD RED SANDSTONE, or MILLSTONE GRIT, is a floetz or flat rock,\r\ncomposed of large grains of sand or quartz (76), coloured by oxide (21)\r\nof iron, and usually cemented together by a kind of clay._\r\n\r\nIn several parts of Derbyshire this kind of rock forms the uppermost\r\nstratum; and in some places, is known to be 120 yards thick.\r\n\r\nWhat are known by the name of _peak millstones_ are formed of millstone\r\ngrit. They are chiefly obtained from quarries near Nether Padley, in\r\nHathersede, Derbyshire; a very inaccessible part of the country, but\r\nwhere the stone is of better quality than it can elsewhere be procured.\r\nThese millstones are made of different dimensions, from two feet in\r\ndiameter, and eight inches thick, to five feet and half in diameter, and\r\nseventeen inches thick.\r\n\r\nSome of the beds of millstone grit, which have spherical stains in them,\r\nof light red colour, are said to be infusible; and are consequently a\r\nvaluable stone for lining the hearths of iron and other furnaces, where\r\nan intense heat is required. These are called _firestones_, and Roches\r\nquarry, near Upper Town, in Ashover, Derbyshire, is famous for them.\r\n\r\nThe upper beds of this kind of rock are often thin, and capable of\r\ndivision, so as to make excellent _paving stones_, or _flags_. There is\r\na particular bed of it at Stanton, in the Peak of Derbyshire, so porous\r\nthat it is made into _filtering stones_ for the cleansing of turbid\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n268. _THIRD SANDSTONE, GRITSTONE, or FREESTONE, is another kind of\r\nfloetz or flat rock, formed of very small agglutinated particles of\r\nsand. It is opaque, usually of whitish colour, and found in large\r\nmasses, of various degrees of hardness._\r\n\r\nThe name of _freestone_ has been given to this kind of rock, from its\r\ncapability of being broken or hewn, with nearly equal facility, in any\r\ndirection. Hence, as well as from its great durability, it is peculiarly\r\nesteemed for buildings. It is also formed into cisterns and troughs of\r\nvarious kinds; into pillars for supporting corn ricks; into _rolling\r\nstones_; and into _grinding stones_ for cutlers, edge─tool makers, and\r\nworkers in polished steel. _Paviors’ flags_, or the stones used for the\r\npaving of footpaths, yards, kitchens, and out─houses, are generally flat\r\npieces of freestone.\r\n\r\n_Scythestones_, or stones for the sharpening of scythes upon, are made\r\nof freestone. Considerable numbers of these are wrought in Derbyshire;\r\nand the dexterity that is displayed in cleaving and forming them is\r\nsomewhat remarkable. The workmen use sharp─pointed picks, several very\r\nsmall wedges, and a hammer. A proper block of stone being selected, two\r\nor three of these small wedges are set in a row, by gentle blows of the\r\nhammer. These blows are successively repeated till the stone splits. The\r\nwedges are then set in a straight line into the face of the piece split\r\noff, and the stone is cleft again in that direction. In this manner the\r\nsub─divisions are continued, until a piece remains of size to make two\r\nscythestones, each an inch and a half square, and about twelve inches\r\nlong. This the workman holds in his left hand, nearly upright; with the\r\npoint of his pick he traces a deep nick down the middle of first one\r\nside and then the other; and then by a slight blow of his pick he\r\nseparates it, into two, so dexterously, that not more than three or four\r\nin a hundred are broken in the cleaving. Such stones as are intended for\r\nround rubbers, are first reduced into an octagonal shape by the point of\r\nthe pick, and then handed over to women and boys, who grind or rub them\r\nin a notch formed in a hard stone, until they are of the requisite\r\nshape. The square ones are finished by being ground on a flat stone.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOther rocks, belonging to what is called the floetz, or flat formation,\r\nhave been already mentioned, under the heads of _lime─stone_ (140),\r\n_gypsum_ (192), _rock salt_ (202), _chalk_ (141), and _coal_ (217).\r\n\r\n\r\n                       III. ALLUVIAL DEPOSITIONS.\r\n\r\n269. _These are described to comprehend all such substances as have been\r\nformed from previously existing rocks, of which the materials have been\r\nworn down, by long exposure to the agency of water and air, and\r\nafterwards deposited in nearly horizontal beds on the surface of the\r\nland._ Alluvial deposits have been formed, and are still forming in\r\nevery quarter of the globe. They occur both in mountainous regions and\r\nin flat countries, filling up the valleys or hollows in the one; and\r\noften forming vast and extended plains in the other.\r\n\r\nThey consist of _peat_, _sand_, _gravel_, _loam_, _clay_, and other\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nIV. VOLCANIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\n270. _Volcanic rocks are composed of such mineral substances as have\r\nbeen ejected from volcanoes, or have been formed by the agency of\r\nsubterraneous fires, and have undergone certain changes in such fires._\r\n\r\nThey are of two kinds; the one called _pseudo volcanic_, such as burnt\r\nclay, porcelain jasper, and earth─slag, which have been altered in\r\nconsequence of the burning of beds of coal in their neighbourhood; and\r\nthe other, called _true volcanic_ minerals, such as stones, ashes, and\r\nlava, which have been thrown out of real volcanoes.\r\n\r\n271. It will somewhat tend to illustrate the history of the mineral\r\nkingdom, to state, in conclusion, under a tabular form, the relative\r\nheights of the principal mountains, or masses of rocks, which occur in\r\nthe different countries of the world; previously remarking, that the\r\nmost lofty and magnificent of these, respecting which any account\r\nsufficiently authentic has hitherto been obtained, are the mountains of\r\nNepaul and Thibet, in Asia, one of the former being 27,667, and the\r\nhighest of the latter measuring at least 23,262 feet, or from 4½ miles\r\nto 5¼ miles in perpendicular height above the level of the sea.\r\nPreviously to the knowledge that has lately been attained respecting the\r\nAsiatic mountains, those of the Andes, on the continent of South\r\nAmerica, had been considered by far the highest in the world. One of\r\nthem, Chimborazo, is 20,900 feet in height. Of the European mountains,\r\nthe highest is Mont Blanc, in Switzerland, which measures 15,680 feet,\r\nor about 2¾ miles. The loftiest summit within the British islands is Ben\r\nNevis, in Inverness─shire, Scotland, which does not exceed 4,380 feet,\r\nor somewhat more than three quarters of a mile; and the great pyramid of\r\nEgypt, the loftiest work of human art and industry with which we are\r\nacquainted, and which will serve as a point in the scale, measures only\r\n477 feet.\r\n\r\n272. It has been remarked that the greatest altitude at which _bananas_\r\nand other _palm─trees_ grow in America is about 3280 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea (Frontispiece, Fig. 48): that in the torrid zone, the\r\nsuperior limits of _oaks_ is about 10,500 feet (49), of _pines_ 12,000\r\nfeet (50), and of _lichen plants_ 18,225 feet (51). The American\r\ntravellers, Messrs. Humboldt and Bonpland, on the twenty─third of June,\r\n1802, ascended the mountain of Chimborazo to the height of 19,400 feet\r\n(52). The highest flight that has been remarked of the South American\r\nvulture, called the _condor_, was 21,000 feet (53). M. Lussac, on the\r\n16th of September, 1804, ascended in a balloon from Paris, to the height\r\nof 22,900 feet. In Switzerland, the limit of perpetual snow is above the\r\naltitude of 9000 feet (54).\r\n\r\n\r\n                  =Height of the Principle Mountains.=\r\n\r\n                                                        _Frontispiece._\r\n\r\n                                                                Ft.\r\n                                                              above\r\n\r\n                                                        Fig. the sea\r\n\r\n=_British Islands._=\r\n\r\n              Scotland Ben Nevis, Inverness─shire       1    4380\r\n                       Ben Lawers, Perthshire           2    4051\r\n               England Skiddaw, Cumberland              3    3530\r\n                       Cross Fell, Cumberland           4    3390\r\n                       Helvellyn, Cumberland            5    3324\r\n                       Wharnside, Yorkshire             6    2480\r\n                       Ingleborough, Yorkshire          7    2380\r\n                 Wales Snowdon, Caernarvonshire         8    3568\r\n                       Cader Idris, Merionethshire      9    3550\r\n               Ireland Macgillicuddy’s Reeks, Kerry    10    3404\r\n                       Sleibh─Dorin, Londonderry       11    3150\r\n\r\n=_Continent of Europe._=\r\n\r\n                France Mont d’Or, Auvergne             12    6707\r\n\r\n                       Puy de Sausi, Auvergne          13    6700\r\n\r\n              Pyrenees Mont Perdu, the highest of the  14  11,283\r\n                       Pyrenees\r\n\r\n                       Le Pic Blanc, Spain             15  10,205\r\n\r\n                  Alps Loucira                         16  14,451\r\n\r\n                       Loupilon                        17  14,144\r\n\r\n           Switzerland Mont Blanc, highest mountain    18  15,680\r\n                       in Europe\r\n\r\n                       Mont Rosa                       19  15,555\r\n\r\n                       Mont St. Gothard                20  10,014\r\n\r\n                 Italy Mont Cimone                     21    6401\r\n\r\n                       Vesuvius                        22    3900\r\n\r\n               Germany Ortler─Spitze, Tyrol            23  15,430\r\n\r\n                       Ostelle, Saltzburg              24  12,800\r\n\r\n                       Carpathian Mountains, highest   25    8640\r\n                       summit\r\n\r\n                       Lomnitz Peak                    26    8640\r\n\r\n                Sweden Areskutan, Jempland             27    6180\r\n\r\n=_Islands._=\r\n\r\n             Teneriffe Peak of Teneriffe               28  12,236\r\n                Sicily Ætna                            29  10,963\r\n               Jamaica Blue Mountains                  30    7431\r\n               Iceland Snæfiel                         31    6860\r\n                       Hecla                           32    4900\r\n\r\n=_Asia._=\r\n\r\n                 India Dhawalgeri in Nepaul            46  27,667\r\n                       Mountains of Thibet             47  23,262\r\n                Turkey Mount Lebanon, estimated at     33    9520\r\n               in Asia Mount Ararat, estimated at      34    9500\r\n                       Mount Ida                       35    4960\r\n\r\n=_America._=\r\n\r\n          Andes, South Chimborazo, Quito               36  20,900\r\n              America.

WATER, generally speaking, is a transparent and nearly\r\nincompressible fluid, the component parts of which are two kinds of gas,\r\ncalled hydrogen (45) and oxygen (21).\r\n\r\nIt is _liquid_ in the common temperature of our atmosphere, assumes a\r\nsolid state under the denomination of _ice_, in a cold temperature (32°\r\nof Fahrenheit’s thermometer); and, by heat at 212°, is converted into an\r\nelastic vapour of almost incredible force, called _steam_. At any\r\ntemperature betwixt these two points, it returns, unaltered, to its\r\nliquid state. The weight of water is about 816 times greater than that\r\nof atmospheric air.\r\n\r\nWater abounds in, and may be considered as, a kind of general cement to\r\nall solid bodies. It performs the most important functions both in the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms, and even enters largely into their\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nA chief part of the nutrition of vegetables is the water which they\r\nabsorb from the earth through the pores of their roots. The great\r\nquantity so absorbed may readily be imagined, when it is stated that the\r\ndriest and most compact kinds of wood, such as even heart of oak, when\r\nconverted into charcoal, lose, during the process, full three─fourths of\r\ntheir weight; and that the fluid which escapes is nearly pure water.\r\nThis fluid is found in the driest of solid bodies, whatever be their\r\ndescription. A piece of hartshorn kept for forty years, and thereby\r\nbecome as hard and dry as metal (so that if struck against a flint it\r\nwould give sparks of fire), upon being distilled, was found to yield an\r\neighth part of its weight of water.\r\n\r\nEvery being with life, in a great degree, lives by it; and whatever\r\ngrows, through it receives its growth; and wherever it enters, it\r\npromotes and sustains life, preserving the whole of created nature in\r\ntheir proper classes of existence. And whether we consider it as\r\nproductive of health to animals and vegetables, as requisite to the\r\nexistence and beauty of the earth, or as one of the great powers by\r\nwhich the Almighty works in the support of the world, we cannot but\r\nadmire and adore the wisdom by which it has been ordained.\r\n\r\nIn the various kinds of water, even of that which is commonly used in\r\ndrinking, and for the preparation of food, there is great difference\r\nboth of taste and appearance. This difference is chiefly occasioned by\r\nthe foreign matters which they hold in solution or suspension. In some\r\ncases the quantity of these is so minute as to have but little influence\r\non the taste; but in others they alter its properties altogether, and\r\nrender the water noxious, or medicinal, or unfit for the preparation of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe _chemical analysis of water_, for the purpose of ascertaining the\r\ndifferent substances which it holds in solution, is one of the most\r\ndifficult and complicated operations that is known in this branch of\r\nscience; and one that exercises, in a peculiar degree, both the skill\r\nand industry of the operator. The difficulty arises not only from the\r\ndiversity of the bodies which occur, but from the very minute quantities\r\nof some of them.\r\n\r\nThese bodies are discovered by an addition to the water of certain\r\nsubstances, the consequence of which is some change in its appearance,\r\nand this change indicates the presence or absence of the bodies\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\nThe substances thus employed are very numerous, and have the name of\r\n_tests_. The methods of ascertaining the exact proportion of each of\r\nthese ingredients are much too complicated to require a place in the\r\npresent work.\r\n\r\nWater cannot be obtained in any state of perfect purity except by the\r\nartificial process of distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ORDER I.—COMMON WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\n274. _RAIN WATER is considered to be next in purity to distilled water,\r\nfrom its having undergone a natural distillation. Its foreign contents\r\nvary according to the state of the air through which it falls. Hence,\r\nfor instance, when it passes through the atmosphere of a smoky town, it\r\nbecomes impure: and when collected in towns, it frequently acquires a\r\nsmall quantity of sulphat of lime (192), and calcareous matter from the\r\nmortar and plaster of the houses._\r\n\r\nThis water is always very soft; and is, consequently, well calculated\r\nfor the dissolving of soap, in washing and other processes. It is also\r\npeculiarly adapted to the solution of alimentary or colouring matter, in\r\nthe preparation of food and dyeing, and is accordingly used to great\r\nextent for these purposes. By the addition of a small quantity of a\r\nsolution of barytes (195), it may be rendered sufficiently pure for all\r\nchemical uses.\r\n\r\nIf rain water be long kept, especially in hot climates, it acquires a\r\ndisagreeable smell, and becomes putrid, and full of animalculæ.\r\n\r\n275. _ICE and SNOW WATER are equal to rain water in purity; and the air\r\nhaving been expelled from them during the process of freezing, they are\r\nconsequently devoid of air when first melted._\r\n\r\nIce and snow, in their natural state, are highly important to mankind.\r\nIt is a general law of nature that all bodies become more dense and\r\nheavy by exposure to cold; but the freezing of water is an exception to\r\nthis law, and for a purpose of extreme benefit to mankind. By this\r\nordination it is that ice always rises to the surface of the water, and\r\nthus preserves from the effects of the surrounding cold, a vast body of\r\nheat in the fluid beneath; and is itself ready to receive its own\r\naccustomed quantity upon the first change of the atmosphere. The\r\nexpansion of water, in freezing, is owing to its assuming a crystallized\r\nform; and this expansion is often so great that glass bottles, filled\r\nwith water, are burst by it.\r\n\r\nDuring the intense cold of winter, snow, which is of a soft and spongy\r\ntexture, is considered of great utility in preventing the immediate\r\naccess of the atmospheric air to the ground; it has doubtless been\r\ndesigned by Providence as a garment to protect the incipient vegetation,\r\nat that inclement season, from injury.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of all the extreme northern parts of the world use\r\nthawed snow for their constant beverage during winter; and the vast\r\nmasses of ice which float in the polar seas afford an abundant supply of\r\nfresh water to the navigators of those dreary regions. Snow water has,\r\nhowever, long lain under the imputation of occasioning those\r\nextraordinary swellings in the neck, which deform the inhabitants of\r\nsome of the alpine valleys of Switzerland; but this opinion is not\r\nsupported by any well─authenticated facts. Indeed it is rendered quite\r\nimprobable by the frequency of this disease in the island of Sumatra,\r\nwhere ice and snow are never seen: and by its being quite unknown in\r\nChili and Thibet, though the rivers of these countries are chiefly\r\nsupplied by the melting of the snows.\r\n\r\n276. _SPRING WATER is nothing more than rain water, which having\r\ngradually filtered through the earth, collects at the bottom of\r\ndeclivities, and there makes its way to the surface._\r\n\r\n_It is obvious that spring water must be nearly as various in its\r\ncontents as the substances through which it flows._\r\n\r\nOrdinary springs pass insensibly into mineral springs, according as\r\ntheir foreign contents become more abundant; but it has not unfrequently\r\nhappened that waters have acquired great medical reputation from their\r\npurity only. Although by far the greater number of springs are cold,\r\nsome are hot, or at least are of a temperature which, at all times,\r\nexceeds that of summer heat: and this warmth is so little influenced by\r\nthe state of the atmosphere, that it is nearly the same both in summer\r\nand winter.\r\n\r\nThe water of almost every spring is of such nature that it will not\r\ndissolve, but curdles, soap; and cannot be used for dressing several\r\nkinds of food. Water of this description is denominated _hard_, a\r\nproperty owing to the great proportion of earthy salts which it holds in\r\nsolution, and which, at the same time, are not in such abundance as to\r\nimpair its taste. The most common of these salts is selenite, or sulphat\r\nof lime (192), and chalk, or carbonat of lime (140); when it contains\r\nonly the latter, the water is easily rendered soft by boiling, which\r\nexpels the excess of carbonic acid (26), and thus causes the chalk to be\r\nprecipitated. Hence originates the earthy crust or _fur_ in such tea\r\nkettles as have had hard water several times boiled in them.\r\n\r\nThe water of deep wells is for the most part much harder than that of\r\nsprings which overflow their channels.\r\n\r\n277. _RIVER WATER is a mixture of spring and rain water, which, from\r\nmuch agitation, and by long exposure to the air, in the course of its\r\nchannel, becomes, in general, tolerably soft and free from earthy\r\nsalts._\r\n\r\nFor washing, and other purposes of domestic economy, river water, from\r\nits softness and purity, is not only preferable to spring water, but\r\nalso serves for many uses to which the latter cannot be at all applied.\r\nAs a beverage, however, it is in general vapid and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nThe waters of some rivers, particularly where the beds, over which they\r\nflow, are sandy or stony, are remarkably pure. This is the case with\r\nseveral of those in Switzerland, Wales, Scotland, and the northern\r\ncounties of England. The river Seine has great repute in France on this\r\naccount: it has been found, on accurate examination, even more pure than\r\nBristol water.\r\n\r\nThat of the river Thames, impregnated as it would appear to be with\r\nputrid remains, is soft and good, when taken up at low water; and, after\r\nrest and filtration, is found to contain but a small portion of any\r\nthing either noxious or unpleasant. It is preferred, by mariners, to\r\nmost other water for sea store; but it soon becomes putrid, and\r\nundergoes a remarkable spontaneous change. When, after having been kept\r\na month or two, a cask is opened, a quantity of inflammable air escapes,\r\nand the water is black and nauseous. If, in this state, it be racked off\r\ninto large earthen vessels (oil jars it is said are commonly used for\r\nthe purpose), and exposed to the air, it gradually deposits a portion of\r\nblack slimy mud, and becomes perfectly clear, sweet, and fit for use.\r\n\r\n278. _STAGNANT WATER contains greater impurities than any other. In\r\nponds and marshes particularly, it is filled with the remains of animal\r\nand vegetable matters, which are there undergoing a gradual\r\ndecomposition._\r\n\r\n_The water of lakes is not, in general, so much contaminated as this;\r\nbut from the same cause, it frequently has a slimy appearance, a\r\nbrownish colour, and an unpleasant taste._\r\n\r\nFrom the putrefying contents of stagnant water, nutriment is afforded to\r\nvarious living plants and insects which there supply the place of those\r\nthat perish. Its taste is vapid, unpleasant, and wholly destitute of\r\nthat agreeable freshness which is found in spring water. It is, however,\r\ngenerally soft, and, by filtration, it may be freed from many of its\r\nimpurities.\r\n\r\nThe air which issues from marshes and stagnant pools is extremely\r\nnoxious, and is the cause of agues and other distressing complaints, to\r\nsuch persons as reside in the neighbourhood of them or are much exposed\r\nto them; and the injurious effects of such air have also been considered\r\nto extend to the internal use of these waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ORDER II.—SEA WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\n279. _SEA WATER is a very heterogeneous compound, not only containing a\r\nconsiderable portion of saline substances, but holding also suspended in\r\nit an infinite number of minute animal and vegetable particles, to the\r\ngradual putrefaction of which its peculiarly nauseous and bitter taste,\r\nat the surface, is in some measure to be attributed._\r\n\r\n_The average quantity of salt in sea water is estimated to amount to\r\nabout one─thirtieth part of its weight. It likewise contains a certain\r\nportion of muriat of magnesia, sulphat of magnesia or Epsom salts (199),\r\nand a small quantity of sulphat of lime (192). Sea water, taken from a\r\ngreat depth, has not the bitterness which the water of the surface has:\r\nit is only saline._\r\n\r\nNo natural waters, if we except certain brine springs and salt lakes,\r\nare so saline as those of the ocean; and the latter differ, in this\r\nrespect, in different parts of the world. At the tropic, the sea is in\r\ngeneral more salt than it is at the poles, a wise ordination to preserve\r\nit, in those climates, from the great tendency to putrefaction: and, at\r\na considerable depth, it is always found more salt than at the surface.\r\nThe water of the Baltic is much less salt than that of the Atlantic; and\r\nit is a remarkable circumstance, that its saline contents are increased\r\nby a west wind, but still more so by a gale from the north west.\r\n\r\nSome philosophers have endeavoured, but to little purpose, to account,\r\nfrom second causes, for the saltiness of the ocean. Dr. Halley persuaded\r\nhimself that it might have been gradually acquired, in very minute\r\nportions, by a deposit of salt washed down from the land by rivers, and\r\nthat, as it could not be carried off by evaporation, instead of being\r\ndiminished, it must be constantly increasing. But this idea of salting\r\nthe sea with fresh water, is, to say the least of it, somewhat absurd,\r\nmore particularly as it presumes that the sea was originally\r\nunimpregnated with salt. Had this been the case, the putrefaction of the\r\nimmense mass of animal and vegetable substances which it gradually\r\ncontained, would, in a short time, have proved fatal to the whole\r\ninhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the sea, although it must necessarily vary in the\r\ndifferent seasons, is much more uniform than that of any inland water\r\nexposed to the atmosphere. This is, in a great measure, attributable to\r\nits vast body of water, and the perpetual agitation to which it is\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nSea water, when congealed by frost, is found to reject all, or nearly\r\nall, its saline particles; and consequently, when thawed, its ice yields\r\nwater so fresh that it may be drunk without unpleasantness. The freezing\r\nof sea water is not unfrequently practised in the northern parts of the\r\nworld, with a view to lessen the trouble and expense of extracting salt\r\nfrom it, for domestic and other uses (202). Salt water may likewise be\r\nrendered fresh and palatable by distillation, a mode which is now very\r\ngenerally practised at sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea shore has of late become so much frequented by invalids, for the\r\npurpose of bathing, that there is scarcely a fishing village, on the\r\nwhole extent of our coast, but which is provided with some accommodation\r\nfor bathers. As a cold bath, sea water is employed, with advantage, in\r\nall those cases of debility for which cold bathing has, in general, been\r\nrecommended. It is also used as an external application in tumours and\r\nsome other complaints; and, taken internally, as a remedy in various\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\nIt is to sea water that we are chiefly indebted for the salt which we\r\nuse at table, and for all the purposes of domestic economy (202). From\r\nthis water is also obtained those salts used in medicine, called\r\nGlauber’s (203) and Epsom salts (199).\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ORDER III.—MINERAL WATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    1. THE MORE SIMPLE COLD WATERS.\r\n\r\n280. _MALVERN WATER is a simple cold water, perfectly bright and\r\npellucid: it has an agreeable, and somewhat pungent flavour; but, in\r\nother respects, it does not differ in taste from pure and good soft\r\nwater._\r\n\r\n_It contains carbonic acid (26), and a very small portion of earth,\r\neither lime or magnesia; but, the carbonic acid perhaps excepted, the\r\nforeign bodies are less in quantity than those even of our common spring\r\nwater._\r\n\r\nThe spring from which this water principally issues is denominated the\r\nHoly Well: and is situated high up the hill, about midway between the\r\nvillages of Great and Little Malvern, in Worcestershire.\r\n\r\nBoth as an external and internal application, the waters of Malvern have\r\nbeen considered beneficial in many obstinate complaints. It is a\r\nsingular circumstance respecting them that, notwithstanding their\r\napparent purity, if they be exposed to the air in an open vessel, they\r\nwill soon acquire a fetid and unpleasant smell.\r\n\r\nMalvern is principally frequented during the summer season.[5]\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Adjoining to Great Malvern, and a little higher up the hill, there is\r\n  a very light and pleasant _chalybeate water_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    2. THE MORE SIMPLE WARM WATERS.\r\n\r\n281. _BRISTOL HOT─WELL WATER is pure, warm, and slightly acidulated,\r\nclear, sparkling, and agreeable to the palate, but without any very\r\ndecided taste. It is also destitute of smell. When poured into a glass\r\nit sends forth numerous air─bubbles. The heat of this spring is very\r\nmoderate, the average_ _being about 74° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer; and\r\nthis heat does not sensibly vary during summer or winter._\r\n\r\n_The foreign contents of the hot─well water are muriat of magnesia,\r\ncommon salt, Glauber’s salt, sulphat of lime (192), and chalk: but these\r\nare in extremely small quantity. It also contains at the rate of about\r\nthirty cubic inches of carbonic acid gas, or fixed air (26), in every\r\ngallon._\r\n\r\nThis water springs from the bottom of the southern extremity of St.\r\nVincent’s rock, a lofty cliff of limestone situated on the north bank of\r\nthe river Avon, and about a mile below the city of Bristol. And,\r\nalthough it is considerably higher than the river, it is so far affected\r\nby the spring tides as to become, thereby, in some degree turbid. The\r\ndischarge of water amounts to about forty gallons in a minute.\r\n\r\nThere is another spring at _Clifton_, on the summit of the same hill,\r\nfrom the bottom of which the waters of the hot─well issues. This is\r\ncalled the _Sion spring_, and is one or two degrees colder, but, in\r\nother respects, it very nearly resembles the water of the hot─well.\r\n\r\nIts discovery was somewhat remarkable. A Mr. Morgan, an attorney of\r\nBristol, having erected a house near the spot, sunk a well for the\r\nsupply of his family with water. The workmen had proceeded to the depth\r\nof nearly 240 feet without success, when they were suddenly alarmed by\r\nthe gushing forth of such an abundance of water that they were compelled\r\nto retreat with precipitation. The proprietor was so far disappointed of\r\nhis hopes as to find that this was a spring of warm instead of cold\r\nwater. But the circumstance induced him to erect an engine to raise the\r\nwater for medicinal purposes; and, since that period, a pump room and\r\nbathing houses have been prepared for the accommodation of visitors.\r\n\r\nThe water of each of these springs, besides being used medicinally in\r\npulmonary consumptions and other complaints, is employed very\r\nextensively at table, and for all domestic purposes. It is remarkable\r\nfor softness and purity; and, from its quality of continuing untainted\r\nfor a great length of time, even in hot climates, is a valuable water\r\nfor long voyages, and is accordingly exported in considerable quantities\r\nto distant parts.\r\n\r\nThe season of general resort to Clifton and the hot─wells is from about\r\nthe middle of April to the end of October.\r\n\r\n282. _MATLOCK WATER is a simple warm water, which, in its sensible\r\nproperties, exclusive of its temperature, which is only about 66° of\r\nFahrenheit, is scarcely different from good spring water. It is\r\nbeautifully clear, and exhales no steam, except in very cold weather._\r\n\r\nThe medicinal virtues of this water have chiefly been ascribed to its\r\ntemperature. Its supply is very copious, and from several different\r\nsources. Though recommended in some internal complaints, it is\r\nprincipally employed as a bath; and, in this respect, it forms a medium\r\nbetwixt the waters of Bath or Buxton and those of the generality of cold\r\nbaths.\r\n\r\nMatlock, which is a beautifully romantic village, situated in a hilly\r\npart of Derbyshire, and at the distance of 143 miles north of London,\r\nwas first brought into public notice about the year 1698, shortly after\r\nwhich period the first bath was erected. It is chiefly frequented from\r\nthe month of May to that of October; or, if the weather continue fine,\r\ntill near the beginning of November.\r\n\r\n283. _BUXTON WATER is a simple warm water, which contains so little\r\nforeign matter, as scarcely to be distinguishable from common spring\r\nwater heated to the same temperature. It has neither smell nor taste;\r\nand, though it sparkles a little in the glass, when first drawn, this is\r\nnot apparently more than what is observable in the water of many common\r\nsprings._\r\n\r\n_Its temperature, in the bath called the Gentleman’s bath, is invariably\r\n82°._\r\n\r\nBuxton has been celebrated, for its warm springs, nearly two centuries\r\nand a half. As early as the year 1572 a treatise on their virtues was\r\npublished: this states them to have been at that time much resorted to\r\nby persons from all the adjacent counties. The water is employed both\r\nexternally and internally, and to great extent. Its principal value, as\r\na bath, arises from its very copious supply, its purity, and its high\r\ntemperature. The sensation which is felt from bathing in it is\r\nconsidered to be such as would be experienced from any bath heated to\r\nthe highest temperature which is compatible with giving some sensation\r\nof cold when the body is first plunged into it. This water is also used\r\nas an internal medicine; and is frequently used by the inhabitants as\r\ntheir common beverage, and for such domestic purposes as its hardness\r\nwill admit.\r\n\r\nThere are several springs and several distinct baths; but the original\r\nand most ancient of them is called St. Ann’s Well, and is enclosed in an\r\nelegant stone building. These waters are frequented by persons afflicted\r\nwith the rheumatism, gout, diseases of the alimentary organs, and\r\nkidneys, and various other complaints: and the chief influx of company\r\nis during the summer and autumnal months.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Buxton is in a narrow and funnel─shaped valley,\r\nsurrounded by wild, bleak, and dreary mountains, in the midst of the\r\ncounty of Derby, and about 160 miles north of London.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  3. HOT CARBONATED CHALYBEATE WATER.\r\n\r\n284. _BATH WATER is a hot carbonated chalybeate. When first drawn, it\r\nappears clear and colourless, nor does it afford any signs of briskness\r\nor effervescence. The temperature of the water drawn from the King’s\r\nBath, which is that usually employed for drinking, is 116° of\r\nFahrenheit, and that of the Cross Bath is 112°. No odour whatever is\r\nperceptible from a glass of fresh water; but from a large body of it the\r\nnose is affected by a slight degree of pungency. When the water is hot\r\nfrom the pump, it fills the mouth with a strong chalybeate impression\r\nwithout any pungency, and accompanied with scarcely any kind of saline\r\ntaste; and, what is remarkable, as soon as the water cools, the\r\nchalybeate taste is entirely lost, and nothing but an extremely slight\r\nsaline sensation remains upon the palate._\r\n\r\n_The foreign contents of Bath water are sulphat of lime (192), chalk,\r\nGlauber’s salt (203), and common salt; together with a very small\r\nportion of oxide of iron (21), yet sufficient to give iron mould stains\r\nto the linen of the bathers. The water curdles soap, and is so hard as\r\nto be unfit for many domestic purposes._\r\n\r\nThe city of Bath has been celebrated for its hot springs even from the\r\ntime of the Romans. These are of higher temperature than any within the\r\nBritish dominions; and indeed are the only natural waters which we\r\npossess that are at all hot to the touch, the other thermal waters being\r\nof heat below the animal temperature.\r\n\r\nThere are three principal sources of these waters, called the King’s\r\nBath, the Cross Bath, and the Hot Bath; and they differ slightly in\r\ntheir properties. The springs arise within a short distance of each\r\nother, at the lower part of the city; and yield so copious a supply that\r\nall the large reservoirs used for bathing are filled every evening with\r\nwater fresh from their respective fountains.\r\n\r\nThe application of the water externally is either general or local. The\r\nlatter consists in pumping it for a considerable time on the part\r\naffected. This is called _dry pumping_, because in it only one part of\r\nthe body is wetted, whilst the rest is kept dry; and in many cases, it\r\nis found an excellent remedy.\r\n\r\nThe diseases for which these waters are resorted to are very numerous,\r\nand are amongst the most important and difficult to be cured that come\r\nunder medical treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   4. HOT ALKALINE SULPHUREOUS WATER.\r\n\r\n285. _AIX─LA─CHAPELLE or AKEN WATER, is an alkaline sulphureous water,\r\nmuch hotter than that of any of the springs in England, varying in\r\ntemperature in the different baths from 112° to 143°. It has a saline,\r\nbitterish, and somewhat alkaline taste; and its smell precisely\r\nresembles, but is greatly more powerful than, that of Harrowgate water\r\n(299)._\r\n\r\n_It contains a small quantity of chalk, common salt, and carbonat of\r\nsoda (201), the latter of which renders it soapy to the touch. But the\r\nmost striking feature in this water is_ _the unusual quantity of sulphur\r\nwhich it contains; and which is so extremely volatile on the application\r\nof heat, that none of it is left in the residuum after evaporation. In\r\nthis water there is also a considerable portion of carbonic acid._\r\n\r\nThe city of Aix─la─Chapelle is in the circle of Westphalia, betwixt the\r\nrivers Meuse and Rhine, about seventy miles east of Brussels, and in a\r\nrich and fertile country. Its waters have been in great medical repute,\r\nand have attracted a numerous concourse of visitants for many centuries\r\npast. Their reputation was so well established, even in the time of\r\nCharlemagne, that he frequently resided at Aix: and he is said to have\r\nbeen so much delighted in the use of the waters as to have sometimes\r\neven held his levee at the baths.\r\n\r\nIn this city, and in the small territory that belongs to it, there are\r\nseveral sources of hot water. Of these the principal spring is enclosed\r\nin a stone cistern, which is vaulted and almost conical at the top, and\r\nthe parts of which are connected with the utmost care, to prevent the\r\nvapour from escaping. From this spring the water flows, in a copious\r\nstream, into several spacious and elegant baths, in the different parts\r\nof the city, distinguished by the names of the Emperor’s Bath, the\r\nNobles’ Bath, the Poor’s Bath, and other appellations. In most of these\r\nthere is every necessary apparatus for bathing by immersion, for vapour\r\nbathing, and for pumping on any particular parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThe water rises, with great quickness, from the springs, and sends forth\r\nbubbles of air, which burst with a slight noise when they reach the\r\nsurface. It is at first perfectly colourless and pellucid, and emits a\r\nlarge portion of steam, and with it a strong sulphureous smell, which is\r\nperceptible at a great distance.\r\n\r\nIts temperature is so high, that, in the large baths, it requires to\r\nstand from fifteen to eighteen hours before it is sufficiently cooled\r\nfor tepid bathing; and it is one of the few natural springs which are\r\nhot enough to be employed as a vapour bath without the addition of\r\nartificial heat. On standing to cool, it gradually loses its clearness,\r\nacquires a milky hue, and deposits an earthy sediment, which is entirely\r\ncalcareous. At the same time it loses its offensive smell, and, when\r\ncold, has scarcely any odour.\r\n\r\nWherever a large quantity of this water passes hot from the spring\r\nthrough a confined place, the upper covering becomes encrusted with\r\nsulphur. This is particularly the case with respect to the dome of the\r\nvault that encloses the great source which supplies the Emperor’s bath,\r\nand which is opened, from time to time, for the purpose of having the\r\nsulphur brushed off.\r\n\r\nFrom the waters of Aix─la─Chapelle, though only internally used, the\r\nbody acquires a sulphureous smell; and even silver worn in the pocket\r\nbecomes tarnished.\r\n\r\n286. _BORSET WATER is of two kinds. One of these resembles the water of\r\nAix in every respect, except as to the impregnation of sulphur, which is\r\nmuch weaker: its temperature is 132°. The other contains no sulphur: it\r\nis, however, equally alkaline, and the heat is as high as 152°, which\r\nmuch exceeds the hottest of the waters of Aix._\r\n\r\nBoth these waters are used by fullers and cloth─workers, on account of\r\nthe convenience they afford, without expense, of a sufficiency of hot\r\nand somewhat alkaline fluid which is well adapted for the cleansing of\r\nwoollen cloth.\r\n\r\nIn the latter of the above─mentioned springs a large portion of earth is\r\nsuspended. This, as the water cools, is deposited, and forms hard\r\nincrustations of considerable thickness round every substance with which\r\nit comes in contact. It is not, however, on this account found less\r\nuseful for the scouring of cloth, boiling of vegetables for the table,\r\nor any of those domestic purposes for which soft water is required.\r\n\r\nIn this spring there is a considerable portion of carbonic acid gas, or\r\nfixed air (26), which is continually escaping from the fresh water, and\r\nis in sufficient quantity to corrode, in a short time, the leaden\r\ncovering that is used for the vapour baths, and any iron within its\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nAfter having supplied several baths, the stream flows into a large fish\r\npond, where it is still of blood heat. In this pond we are informed that\r\ncarp and tench multiply very fast, and grow to an enormous size; but\r\nthat their flesh is soft and without flavour, until they have been\r\nremoved, for about six months, into a pond of cold water, where they\r\nbecome perfectly firm and good for the table.\r\n\r\nIn their medicinal application these waters are chiefly employed\r\nexternally, and their great heat allows of every convenience for vapour,\r\nhot, warm, and tepid bathing. The village of Borset, or Bordscheit, in\r\nwhich they are found, is situated about a quarter of a mile south of\r\nAix─la─Chapelle (285).\r\n\r\n\r\n          5. HOT, SALINE, HIGHLY CARBONATED CHALYBEATE WATER.\r\n\r\n287. _THE VICHY WATERS are hot, saline, and chalybeate. They vary in\r\nsome degree in the different springs, have a salt and somewhat bitter\r\ntaste, and a considerable pungency of smell. They are alkaline, and\r\nabout the temperature of 120°._\r\n\r\nThere are, at Vichy, a small town on the banks of the river Allier,\r\nabout 180 miles south─east of Paris, no fewer than six different springs\r\nof hot water, which vary somewhat in their temperature, and in the\r\nproportion of their foreign contents. The valley in which this town is\r\nsituated is highly fertile and beautiful, and abounds in vineyards and\r\nfruit─trees.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that sheep, cows, and other animals, crowd to drink\r\nthis water with great eagerness, and even to lick the stones and sides\r\nof the channel through which it flows. Their partiality for it is so\r\ngreat that, at certain times, they are known to swim across the river\r\nAllier, in considerable numbers together, without even tasting of that\r\nwater, and to proceed, without interruption onward, until they reach\r\nthis their favourite beverage.\r\n\r\n288. _CARLSBAD WATER is hot, saline, and chalybeate, having an\r\nunpleasant alkaline and bitter taste, though scarcely any smell. Its\r\nconstant temperature is 165°. It contains chalk, Glauber’s salt (203),\r\ncommon salt, and carbonat of soda (201), together with a small portion\r\nof iron; and carbonic acid gas, or fixed air (26), in considerable\r\nquantity._\r\n\r\nThe town of Carlsbad, situated on the river Eger, in Bohemia, and its\r\nsprings (which have the name of _Caroline baths_), received their\r\nappellation from the Emperor Charles the Fourth, who is said to have\r\nhimself discovered the latter, in the year 1370, whilst hunting; and,\r\nsince that period, few waters have more engaged the attention of\r\nchemists and physicians than these. Carlsbad is now much frequented\r\nduring the summer months, and has good accommodations as a watering\r\nplace. Its water is remarkable for a rapid and copious deposition of\r\ncalcareous earth, which takes place always on cooling, and forms a very\r\nhard and beautiful crust on the inner surface or tube of any channel\r\nthrough which it flows; and forms petrifactions round moss, pieces of\r\nstraw, or other extraneous substances which are put into the stream,\r\neven for so short a time as twenty─four hours. All the iron which the\r\nfresh water contains is also precipitated by cooling, and rather sooner\r\nthan the calcareous earth. A very fine laminated calcareous stone in\r\nvariegated colours is thus formed in large masses around the channel of\r\nthe stream, which, when polished, is almost equal in beauty to jasper.\r\n\r\nOf the hot springs of this neighbourhood the principal is called the\r\n_Sprudel_. It boils up, with great violence, and discharges about 352\r\ncubic feet of water hourly, through a curious natural vault or\r\nincrustation which it has gradually formed. This water supplies the\r\ngreater number of the baths. The other springs are, in general, of much\r\nlower temperature: they do not exceed from 114° to 125°, and they differ\r\nsomewhat from each other in their chemical properties. They all contain\r\na large portion of carbonic acid gas, or fixed air, and this is given\r\nout in such quantity by the water, that it fills several caverns, in the\r\nrocks adjoining to the springs, rendering them fatal to all animals\r\nwhich incautiously enter them.\r\n\r\nThe waters of Carlsbad are used for the removal of a great variety of\r\ndisorders, but particularly such as are connected with indigestion. They\r\nare likewise used in obstructions of the bowels, and diseases of the\r\nkidneys. About five pints, divided into fourteen portions, are, on an\r\naverage, drunk by each individual every day.\r\n\r\nThe Sprudel spring is better than that of any mineral waters which are\r\nemployed medicinally. It requires to be considerably cooled before it\r\ncan either be used as a bath, or drunk. Its heat is such that it is\r\noccasionally employed, in place of water artificially heated, for\r\nseveral domestic purposes, such as the scalding of fowls and hogs, the\r\nfeathers and hair of which it immediately loosens.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred pounds weight of Glauber’s salt are annually prepared\r\nfrom this water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        6. SIMPLE SALINE WATERS.\r\n\r\n289. _SEDLITZ WATER is very salty and bitter. It contains a small\r\nportion of chalk, some sulphat of lime (192), carbonat of magnesia,\r\nmuriat of magnesia, and a very great proportion of Epsom salt (199), to\r\nwhich its bitter taste and medicinal virtues are principally\r\nattributed._\r\n\r\nThe spring for which the village of Sedlitz, in Bohemia, has long been\r\ncelebrated, was, for many years, wholly neglected by the inhabitants, on\r\naccount of the bitter and nauseous taste of its water, which rendered it\r\nunfit for nearly all domestic purposes. Its virtues, as a medicine, were\r\nfirst brought into notice about the year 1721, by Hoffman, the\r\ncelebrated Prussian physician.\r\n\r\nThis water is considered a valuable remedy in cases of indigestion, for\r\nremoving scorbutic humours, and in several other complaints.\r\n\r\n290. _EPSOM WATER is saline, and partakes, in some degree, of the nature\r\nand qualities of Sedlitz water, but it is by no means so powerful. It is\r\ntransparent and colourless; and, when first taken into the mouth, has\r\nscarcely any taste, but it leaves a decidedly bitter and saltish taste\r\non the palate._\r\n\r\n_This water contains sulphat of magnesia, or Epsom salt (199), selenite,\r\nand a small portion of chalk._\r\n\r\nAlthough the Epsom waters, on account of their deficiency of strength,\r\nare now scarcely ever employed in medicine, yet they were among the\r\nfirst saline cathartic springs which were brought into use in this\r\ncountry. The salt to which they owe their property, and which is known\r\nthroughout Europe by the name of Epsom salt, was, for many years,\r\nprepared almost exclusively from them and from Sedlitz water. But the\r\nquantity which they supplied was found so very inadequate to the\r\nincreasing demands for this salt in medicine, that Epsom Salt has, for\r\nsome time past, been manufactured from sea water.\r\n\r\nEpsom water, if closely corked, may be kept for several months without\r\ninjury: but, otherwise, it soon becomes putrid. The spring from which it\r\nissues is situated about half a mile from the town of Epsom in Surrey,\r\nsixteen miles south of London.\r\n\r\nThere are, in the neighbourhood of London, many springs of similar\r\nquality to this of Epsom: of these the principal are at Acton, Kilburne,\r\nBagnigge Wells, and formerly the Dog and Duck in St. George’s Fields;\r\nbut they are, in general, so weak as to render very large quantities of\r\nthe water necessary to produce any sufficient medical effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  7. HIGHLY CARBONATED ALKALINE WATER.\r\n\r\n291. _SELTZER WATER is an highly carbonated alkaline water. When fresh,\r\nor well preserved, it is perfectly clear, and sparkles much when poured\r\ninto a glass. It is somewhat pungent, slightly saline, and a little\r\nalkaline to the taste._\r\n\r\n_It contains chalk, carbonat of magnesia, carbonat of soda (201), and\r\ncommon salt; and more carbonic acid gas, or fixed_\r\n\r\n_air (26), than any water hitherto known. It is hard, and curdles with\r\nsoap._\r\n\r\nThe spring which supplies this water is situated in Nieder Seltzer, a\r\nvillage in a fine woody country, within the bishopric of Treves; and\r\nthere are few mineral springs which have acquired so much celebrity for\r\nmedical virtues as this. The diseases, for the removal of which it has\r\nbeen successfully applied, are too numerous to be here particularized.\r\n\r\nTo the taste it is very agreeable, and when drunk in moderate quantity,\r\nit exhilarates the spirits, increases the appetite, and produces no\r\nparticular determination to the bowels. It is to the strong impregnation\r\nwith carbonic acid, and the small proportion of soda which it contains,\r\nthat its most important benefits are owing.\r\n\r\nIf it be closely corked and sealed, Seltzer water may be kept without\r\ninjury, or even alteration, for a very considerable time; but, if\r\nexposed to the air, it soon becomes fetid. It is used as a common drink\r\nat table in many parts of Germany and Holland, and is even brought into\r\nEngland in stone bottles, each containing about three pints. A large\r\nproportion of Seltzer water, either genuine or artificial, is consumed\r\nin this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         8. CHALYBEATE WATERS.\r\n\r\n292. Are such as contain a portion of iron. This is easily detected by\r\nthe property which it has of striking a black colour with tincture of\r\nnutgalls.\r\n\r\n293. _TUNBRIDGE WATER is a carbonated chalybeate, the small portion of\r\niron which it contains being held in solution by carbonic acid (26). It\r\nis, however, neither brisk nor acidulous. To the taste it is simply\r\nchalybeate; and that only in a slight degree._\r\n\r\n_Its foreign contents are oxide of iron (21), a small portion of common\r\nsalt, muriat of magnesia, and sulphat of lime (192), carbonic acid gas\r\nor fixed air (26), and other gases, but these only in small quantity._\r\n\r\nTunbridge Wells is a populous village, situated in a sandy but romantic\r\nvalley in the county of Kent, about five miles from the town of\r\nTunbridge, and thirty─six miles south of London. There are, at this\r\nplace, many chalybeate springs, all of which nearly resemble each other\r\nin their chemical properties. Two of them, however, are chiefly used,\r\neach of which yields about a gallon of water in a minute.\r\n\r\nWhen first taken from the stone basin into which it flows, the water is\r\nperfectly clear and bright, and exhales no particular smell. It does not\r\nsparkle in the glass, but a few bubbles slowly separate, and adhere to\r\nthe sides of the vessel. When it has stood for some hours exposed to the\r\nair, it becomes turbid, and otherwise undergoes a very material change.\r\nAs it does not properly curdle soap, it may be denominated a soft water.\r\n\r\nThe original discovery of this water, as to its medical properties, is\r\nusually considered to have been in the reign of James the First. The\r\nseason for drinking it commences as early as March or April, and\r\ncontinues till November.\r\n\r\n_294. SPA WATER, the celebrity of which has given a general appellation\r\nto most other mineral springs, is a highly carbonated chalybeate water,\r\nwhich contains a great proportion of carbonic acid (26). It has an\r\nagreeable acidulous taste, mixed with a strong impression of chalybeate,\r\nwhich remains on the palate for a considerable time after it has been\r\ndrunk._\r\n\r\n_It contains oxide of iron (21), chalk, carbonat of magnesia, carbonat\r\nof soda (201), and common salt, together with about forty─five parts in\r\na hundred of carbonic acid gas or fixed air (26); and is sufficiently\r\nsoft to mix both with milk and soap without curdling._\r\n\r\nSpa is a small but celebrated town in the Netherlands. It is situated on\r\nthe little river Weze, about twenty miles south─east of Liege, and seven\r\nmiles south─west of Linsburg; and is surrounded by rude and uncultivated\r\nmountains, many of which are covered with wood, and others with heath or\r\nmorasses. In its neighbourhood there are no fewer than sixteen mineral\r\nsprings, five of which are more celebrated than the others. The most\r\ncopious and most frequented of the whole is the _Pouhon spring_, in the\r\nmarket─place of Spa. This is a large, slow, and deep spring, the descent\r\nto which is by several steps. In cold dry weather the water, when first\r\ntaken up, appears colourless and perfectly transparent: it scarcely\r\nsparkles, but it soon covers the inside of the glass with small\r\nair─bubbles, which it also emits very copiously when shaken. During\r\nmoist weather the surface of the well appears somewhat turbid: and, on\r\nthe approach of rain, a whistling or humming noise is heard, which is\r\ncalled by the country people the music of the spring.\r\n\r\nIf this water be bottled, and then set in a warm place, it will\r\ngenerally force out the cork, with a loud explosive noise. In preserving\r\nit for exportation, it is consequently necessary to wire the corks\r\nfirmly down. In this state, if well cemented, it may be kept perfectly\r\ngood for more than two years.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat remarkable, respecting this water, that if it be taken in\r\na full draught, particularly in hot weather, or upon an empty stomach,\r\nit produces a swimming in the head, and a degree of intoxication, which\r\nfrequently continues for half an hour or upwards, and is very similar to\r\nthat which arises from the drinking of spirituous liquor, but it does\r\nnot leave the same debility.\r\n\r\n295. _PYRMONT WATER is a highly carbonated chalybeate. When recently\r\ntaken from the spring, it is clear and pellucid, and sends forth a\r\ncopious stream of bubbles for a considerable time. In this respect it\r\nfar exceeds any of the mineral waters with which we are acquainted. Its\r\ntaste is pleasant, being strongly acidulated, and having a pungency not\r\nunlike that of brisk Champagne wine; but it is at the same time strongly\r\nchalybeate, and a little bitterish._\r\n\r\n_It chiefly contains oxide of iron (21), chalk, carbonat of magnesia,\r\nEpsom salt (199), sulphat of lime (193), and common salt, and a great\r\nproportion of carbonic acid gas, or fixed air. It is very hard._\r\n\r\nPyrmont is a town of Westphalia, and about thirty─eight miles south─west\r\nof Hanover. It is the capital of a county, has a strong fort, and is\r\nwell known on account of its mineral springs.\r\n\r\nThe water which issues from these springs constantly emits so large a\r\nquantity of gas as to have a sensible pungency of smell to those who\r\nstand around, and even to make the water─servers giddy. It forms an\r\natmosphere over the surface of the well which proves fatal to ducks and\r\nsmall birds that attempt to swim across. The gas contained in the water\r\nis estimated to be nearly equal in bulk to the water. It is owing to\r\nthis, that Pyrmont water, if bottled and well corked, and afterwards\r\nremoved into a warm place, will frequently burst the bottles.\r\n\r\nWhen drawn fresh from the spring and drunk copiously, it produces a\r\ntemporary kind of intoxication. It also enlivens the spirits and\r\nincreases the appetite. This water is sent in bottles, by the Weser, to\r\nBremen, whence it is exported to various parts of the world.\r\n\r\n296. _CHELTENHAM WATER is a saline, carbonated, chalybeate, which has a\r\nslight sulphureous smell, and a brackish, somewhat bitter, and\r\nchalybeate taste, but no briskness nor pungency._\r\n\r\n_Its foreign contents are Glauber’s salts (203), muriat and carbonat of\r\nmagnesia, common salt, and oxide of iron, together with a portion of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, and some other kinds of gas._\r\n\r\nThe original discovery of the mineral spring at Cheltenham was about the\r\nyear 1716. The water of this spring issues slowly, and in a scanty\r\nstream of not more than 35 pints in an hour, from a bed of sand\r\nintermixed with blue clay. The well is sunk to the depth of six feet,\r\nand is excluded from communication with the external air. This spring is\r\ndenominated the _Old Spa_.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1788, on digging a well for a private house, another spring\r\nwas accidentally discovered, which is of nearly the same nature as this,\r\nand produces a much more abundant supply of water. It is about a hundred\r\nyards distant from it, is upwards of forty feet deep, and is drawn by a\r\npump.\r\n\r\nWhen Cheltenham water is fresh drawn, it appears tolerably clear, though\r\nnot perfectly transparent. After standing some time, it becomes more\r\nturbid, and air─bubbles, in small quantity, rise from it. It contains\r\nmore salt than perhaps any other waters, except those of the sea and\r\nsome brine springs; and by far the greatest part of the salts are of a\r\npurgative kind. It is also a very strong chalybeate, and has a slight\r\nimpregnation of sulphur.\r\n\r\nThis water cannot long be kept, nor can it be transported to any\r\ndistance without being materially altered. In order, however, to reduce\r\nits valuable parts to a more convenient form, for carriage and keeping,\r\nthe salts are extracted from it on the spot, by evaporation, and\r\ncrystallizing the residuum. These salts are much used, in addition to\r\nthe fresh water, for the purpose of increasing its operation on the\r\nbowels.\r\n\r\nCheltenham is a small town in the county of Gloucester. It is about\r\nninety─five miles north─west of London, situated in a sandy vale,\r\nsurrounded with hills of moderate height, and in the midst of a fertile\r\nand well cultivated country.\r\n\r\n297. _BRIGHTON CHALYBEATE WATER is a vitriolated chalybeate, which, when\r\nfresh, has a peculiar and faint smell not uncommon in ferruginous\r\nwaters, and a strong though not unpleasant chalybeate taste._\r\n\r\n_It contains sulphat of iron or vitriol (208), sulphat of lime (182),\r\ncommon salt, muriat of magnesia, siliceous earth, and a certain portion\r\nof carbonic acid gas (26)._\r\n\r\nBrighton is a well─known market─town, situated on the coast of Sussex,\r\nand about fifty─four miles south of London. The chalybeate spring is at\r\nWick, on the declivity of a small eminence nearly a mile west of the\r\ntown, and a quarter of a mile from the sea. A small but neat building\r\nhas been erected immediately over the spot from which the water issues,\r\nand where it is received, a few feet under ground, into a basin of\r\nPortland stone. This reservoir contains only a few gallons of water, but\r\nit fills again almost as soon as it is emptied.\r\n\r\nThe water is so hard as instantly to curdle soap. It is considered\r\nuseful in cases of debility, indigestion, and such diseases for which\r\nchalybeate and tonic remedies are required. The sea─bathing at Brighton\r\nis, in many cases, an additional and important advantage to those\r\npersons who use the chalybeate water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      9. COLD SULPHUREOUS WATERS.\r\n\r\n298. HEPATIC, or SULPHUREOUS WATERS, are so strongly impregnated with\r\nsulphur, united either to hydrogen (45), or to an alkali, or both, as\r\nthereby to acquire a very sensible smell and taste. They have the\r\nproperty of blacking silver and lead; and are immediately known by the\r\nsmell, which is very fetid, and like that which arises from the scouring\r\nof a foul gun─barrel, or, as some persons suppose, like the smell of\r\nrotten eggs.\r\n\r\nThe taste of these waters is peculiar, and rather sweetish. They\r\nconstitute a drink which, at first, is very unpalatable, but which, by\r\nhabit, is soon reconciled to the drinker. None of them will bear\r\ncarriage to any distance.\r\n\r\n299. _HARROWGATE WATER is a cold sulphureous water, which has a very\r\nstrong and fetid smell, like that of a damp rusty gun─barrel. To the\r\ntaste it is bitter, nauseous, and strongly saline._\r\n\r\n_Its foreign contents are common salt, muriat of lime, muriat of\r\nmagnesia, chalk, carbonat of magnesia, Epsom salt (199), carbonic acid\r\ngas, or fixed air (26), azotic gas, and sulphureted hydrogen gas._\r\n\r\nThere are, at Harrowgate, four distinct sulphureous springs, which\r\nappear to have their rise in a large bog, at a small distance from the\r\nwells. The water of all these springs is similar in its properties and\r\nits distinguishing characters, but as one of them is more strongly\r\nimpregnated with sulphur than the others, this alone is used for\r\ndrinking, whilst the other three are employed to supply the baths.\r\n\r\nWhen the water of the former of these springs is first taken up, it is\r\nperfectly clear and transparent; and sends forth a few air─bubbles.\r\nNotwithstanding both its nauseous smell and taste, such is the power of\r\nhabit in reconciling it to the palate, that, after a little while,\r\nnearly all persons who drink this water do it without disgust.\r\n\r\nWhen exposed to the air it loses its transparency, and assumes a\r\nsomewhat greenish colour: the sulphureous odour abates; and, at last,\r\nthe sulphur is deposited on the bottom and sides of the vessel in which\r\nit is kept.\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of Harrowgate water that a secret correspondence has\r\noften been carried on by means of it. A letter written with solution of\r\nsugar of lead is illegible; but if dipped into this water the writing\r\nwill not merely become visible, but, in a short time, will appear almost\r\nblack. Hydrogen has the property of reviving the metallic oxides: hence\r\nalso it is that ladies who have used metallic cosmetics have become of a\r\ndark tawny colour by bathing in these waters.\r\n\r\nHarrowgate has long been celebrated for its sulphureous waters. It has\r\nalso two very valuable chalybeate springs, called the _Old Spa_, and the\r\n_Tewit Well_, the water of which was formerly used internally, whilst\r\nthe other water was confined to external use. But, at present, the\r\nlatter is employed to very great extent as an internal medicine.\r\n\r\nThe two villages of High and Low Harrowgate are situated in a pleasant\r\nopen country, in the centre of the county of York, near the town of\r\nKnaresborough, and about 212 miles north of London.\r\n\r\n300. _MOFFAT WATER is a cold sulphureous water, the smell of which is\r\nprecisely similar to that of Harrowgate water, and the taste simply\r\nsaline, and without any bitterness._\r\n\r\n_Its foreign contents are common salt, together with carbonic acid gas,\r\nazotic gas, and sulphureted hydrogen gas. It is consequently very simple\r\nin its composition._\r\n\r\nMoffat is a village situated, at the head of a valley, on the banks of\r\nthe river Annan, and about fifty─six miles south─west of Edinburgh. It\r\nis surrounded by hills, some of which are very lofty. This village has\r\nobtained so much celebrity, on account of its waters, as to be\r\nconsidered the Harrowgate of North Britain. These issue from a rock\r\nwhich is at a little distance below a bog, whence, probably, they derive\r\ntheir sulphureous ingredients. The principal spring is contained within\r\na stone building, and affords a sufficient quantity of water to supply\r\nevery demand. It is drawn by a pump.\r\n\r\nWhen the water is first taken from the well it appears somewhat milky\r\nand bluish. It sparkles a little; but, on being exposed to the air, it\r\nbecomes turbid, and throws up a thin film, which, on examination, will\r\nbe found pure sulphur. This change takes place even in close vessels, so\r\nthat it cannot be sent to any distance with advantage.\r\n\r\nThe common people so much esteem this water that many of them drink at\r\nthe rate of from six to ten quarts of it in a morning, and one instance\r\nhas been stated of a person drinking thirty─two quarts of it in eight\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n                                 TO THE\r\n                             FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n                                ───────\r\n\r\n Acid, sulphuric, 12; how made, properties and uses of, 145\r\n\r\n Acid, phosphoric, 12\r\n\r\n Acid, carbonic, 12\r\n\r\n Acid, fluoric, 13; how made, properties and uses of, 120\r\n\r\n Acid, boracic, 13\r\n\r\n Acid, muriatic, 13; How made and uses of, 132\r\n\r\n Acid, nitric, 14; How made, and uses of, 138\r\n\r\n Adamant.
