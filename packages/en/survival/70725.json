Respect has been shown to the work of men of\r\noriginality in research and thought, and care has been taken\r\nto adhere closely to the original text when either quoting or\r\ntranslating. I am especially indebted to Professor H. Pittier, whose\r\ngreat qualifications for a scientific exploration of Costa Rica\r\ncannot be overestimated; to Mr. Anastasio Alfaro, the Director of\r\nthe National Museum; to Mr. Manuel Aragon, the Director General of\r\nthe National Statistical Department; to Dr. Juan Ullua, the Minister\r\nof Fomento; to Joaquin B. Calvo, Minister Resident in Washington;\r\nand Mr. Rafael Iglesias, the able President of the Republic of Costa\r\nRica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTOPOGRAPHY, GEOLOGY AND MINERAL WEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCosta Rica, the southernmost Republic of Central America, is\r\nadvantageously situated within the North tropical zone, adjoining\r\nColombia, the most northern state of South America. It is between\r\nthe two great oceans, having also the prospect of one inter-oceanic\r\nship-canal at one extremity and another ship-canal near the other.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica is between 8° and 11° 16′ N. latitude and 81° 35′ and\r\n85° 40′ W. longitude from Greenwich. Its area is between 54,070 and\r\n59,570 sq. kilometers, the difference arising from the boundary line\r\nunsettled with Colombia. We follow here Colonel George Earl Church’s\r\npaper in the London Geographical Journal of July, 1897, which gives\r\nin a condensed form all important results of extensive explorations\r\nby Professor H. Pittier as well as well-written abstracts of\r\nimportant publications of the “Instituto fisico geografico Nacional”\r\nand of the “Museo Nacional” of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThe mountains of Costa Rica are not a continuous Cordillera, although\r\nin general they extend from the frontier of Colombia to within a few\r\nmiles of Brito. The entire country may properly be divided into two\r\ndistinctive groups by a natural line running between the mouths of\r\nthe Reventazon and Rio Grande de Pirris; groups which can be called\r\n“volcanic mountains” or “mountains of the northwest,” and “Talamanca\r\nmountains” or “mountains of the southeast.” It is clear that the\r\nCaribbean Sea once joined the Pacific Ocean through this valley of\r\nthe river Reventazon in which the Costa Rica Railway now climbs to\r\nreach Cartago. In weighing existing data there seems to be no room\r\nfor doubt that the highlands of Costa Rica once formed part of a\r\nvast archipelago extending from Panama to Tehuantepec. The lowest\r\ninter-oceanic depressions between the Arctic Ocean and the Straits\r\nof Magellan are the divide between the two oceans at Panama which is\r\n286 feet above the sea-level, and the narrow strip of land separating\r\nLake Nicaragua from the Pacific, which has only about 150 feet\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nThe “volcanic mountains” or “the mountains of the northwest” can\r\nagain be divided into two sections. The first comprises the part\r\nsituated between the Rio Reventazon and a depression which connects\r\nSan Ramon with the water-shed of San Carlos, including the groups\r\nof the volcanoes Turialba (11,000 feet), Irazú (11,200 feet), Barba\r\n(9335 feet) and Poas (8675 feet). The second section comprises the\r\npart which extends from the Barranca River to the Lake of Nicaragua\r\nwith the groups of Tilaran, Miravalles, La Vieja and Orosi.\r\n\r\nThe first section may be called “Cordillera Central” or “Cordillera\r\ndel Irazú” and the second “Cordillera del Miravalles.” The three\r\nmasses which form the volcanic Cordillera of Irazú are separated by\r\ntwo depressions: first by that of La Palma, 1500 meters above the\r\nsea, between Irazú and Barba, and second by that of Desengaño, 1800\r\nmeters above the sea, between Barba and Poas.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the two western masses seems to be formed of basaltic\r\nrocks, while the trachytes dominate in the eastern mass. Irazú and\r\nTurialba, which is part of the same mass, seem to have ejected lavas\r\nin a compact state. The height of volcanoes diminishes towards the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe three orographic groups which dominate the northern central\r\nplateau do not show the regular conical form which usually\r\ncharacterizes a volcano. The general line of the southern\r\nslopes ascends in an imperceptible manner towards the summit,\r\nnotwithstanding that they are composed of a succession of terrace\r\nplains. On the Irazú, for instance, eight such terraces are\r\nobservable from Cartago to the summit. The northern declivity is more\r\nprecipitous, being over 60° on the Irazú.\r\n\r\nThe peak of the Irazú is a point from which go various spurs and\r\nsecondary mountains in opposite directions, one to the west and\r\none to the east, the latter terminating in a crater where the\r\nParismina River takes its origin. The western mountains trend first\r\nin a westerly direction to the Cerro Pelon, where they divide, one\r\npart descending south to the pass of Ochomogo, 1540 meters above\r\nsea-level; the other, after taking a northwesterly direction,\r\nterminating in the plain of La Palma, which is a part of the\r\nwater-shed of the two oceans. On the south various mountains follow\r\nthe rivers Pirris and Turialba. The Irazú has various craters, formed\r\nsuccessively, each one contributing to the gradual rising of the mass.\r\n\r\nThe Irazú, which had eruptions in 1723, 1726, 1821 and 1847, has now\r\nan altitude of 3414 m. (11,200 feet), and from its summit both oceans\r\nare visible, and also the great valleys of San Juan and of Lake\r\nNicaragua, as well as the mountains of Pico Blanco, Chirripo, Buena\r\nVista and Las Vueltas. Turialba had a famous eruption of sand and\r\nashes which began on the 17th of August, 1864, and lasted to March,\r\n1865. Its heaviest ejected matter fell to the west, and Seebach\r\nclassifies it as andesite. Another eruption, occurring on February 6,\r\n1866, was accompanied by heavy earthquakes and sent its ashes as far\r\nas Puntarenas.\r\n\r\nThe Cordillera del Miravalles commences with the volcano Orosi,\r\nsituated near the southwest extremity of Lake Nicaragua. In its\r\nsoutheast trend it recedes more and more from the lake and the San\r\nJuan River. It is an irregular, broad and volcano-dotted chain,\r\nabout sixty geographical miles long, breaking down gradually on\r\nthe northwest from Orosi to the Sapoa River, one of the southern\r\nboundaries of Nicaragua. In this short distance are found the Cerro\r\nde la Vieja (6508 feet), the Montemuerto (8000 feet), the beautiful\r\nvolcano Tenorio (6700 feet), the volcanoes Miravalles (4665 feet),\r\nthe Rincon (4498 feet), and the Orosi (5195 feet).\r\n\r\nThese mountains, as far as they have been examined, are found to\r\nbe of eruptive origin, basalts and trachytes predominating, but\r\nextensive sedimentary rock formations are also found upon their\r\nslopes, as well as vast deposits of boulders, clay, earth and\r\nvolcanic material.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of Nicoya, forming a part of Guanacaste, is partly\r\nan elevated plain and partly consists of hills and mountain ridges\r\nseldom attaining a greater elevation than 1500 feet. It is also\r\ncomposed of eruptive rocks and sedimentary formations, the latter\r\nbeing especially visible in the valley of Tempisque.\r\n\r\nBetween the northern volcanic section and the more regular Talamanca\r\nrange is the notable “Ochomogo” Pass, about twenty miles broad, and a\r\nlittle more than 5000 feet above the sea-level at the water parting.\r\n\r\nTo the eastward through this gap, and in a broad, deeply eroded\r\nvalley, runs the tumultuous Reventazon River, and to the westward the\r\nRio Grande de Pirris. On the south of this depression the Chirripo\r\nGrande mountain mass sends off east and west two immense flanking\r\nranges. A part of the western range, lying between San Marcos and\r\nSanta Maria, for a length of about six miles, is known as the Dota\r\nridge, to which former explorers gave great importance.\r\n\r\nThis lofty, transverse and precipitous mountain system almost\r\nforbids communication between the northern and southern halves of\r\nthe Republic, and, as Colonel Church says, must at all times have\r\nhad a marked influence on the movement of races in this part of\r\nCentral America. Both the northern and Talamanca sections present\r\nmountains in masses instead of sierrated like many Andean chains of\r\nNorth America. Those of the Talamanca section are Rovalo (7050 feet),\r\nPico Blanco (9650 feet). Chirripo Grande (11,850 feet) and Buena\r\nVista (10,820 feet). There are no signs of recent volcanic activity\r\nin the Talamanca range. The Talamanca mountains have narrow crests\r\nand are very precipitous on the Atlantic side, with evidences of\r\nextensive denudations and erosions caused by the ceaseless rain-laden\r\ntrade-winds.\r\n\r\nProfessor William M. Gabb, in his geological sketch of Talamanca,\r\nobserves that the geological structure of the entire region is very\r\nsimple. The greatest expanse is occupied by recent sedimentary rocks\r\nraised and nearly entirely metamorphosed by the action of volcanic\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nAt several points along the Atlantic coast, there are found masses\r\nof rocks of still later date. Professor Gabb maintains that the\r\nnucleus of the great Cordillera of the interior is formed by granites\r\nand syenites, which, like the sediment that covers them, are broken\r\nthrough here and there by dikes of volcanic origin identical with\r\nthe eruptive material found on a greater scale in the northern part\r\nof Costa Rica. The syenites are intrusive and have their culminating\r\npoint and greatest development in the Pico Blanco or Kamuk, a\r\nmountain of great altitude, unusual ruggedness and scarred with deep\r\nand precipitous cañons. All these dikes are of more modern formation\r\nand are porphyritic. Professor Gabb also notes a thick deposit of\r\nconglomerates and sandstones, schists and limestones, the schists\r\nbeing the most abundant; although the conglomerates, found all over\r\nthe region, indicate the previous existence of an older sedimentary\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles which form the conglomerates are composed of metamorphic\r\nclay, having a character distinct from all the other rocks found\r\nin the country. The cement is also clay or sand. The absence of\r\ncrystalline rocks in the conglomerates is irrefutable proof that,\r\nwhen these were deposited, the syenites and granites had not yet\r\nappeared from the interior of the earth. The limestone and sandstone\r\nrepresent a less developed geographical horizon of the sedimentary\r\ngroup, the latter appearing occasionally in layers, interstratified\r\nwith conglomerates or more recent schists. In no place in Talamanca\r\nhave fossils been found in these sandstones, although the same rocks\r\nare very fossiliferous near Zapote on the River Reventazon.\r\n\r\nIn regard to fossils, Professor Gabb saw at Las Lomas Station, about\r\nseven hundred feet above the sea, in the Bonilla Cliffs cutting,\r\nshark’s teeth, compact masses of sea shells, fish, etc., and at an\r\nelevation of 2500 feet large deposits of compact shell limestone.\r\n\r\nThe schists have a fine, leaf-like texture, and are easily decomposed\r\nand reduced to a black mud, if they have not been metamorphosed. In\r\nthis rock fossils have been found which belong to a Miocene age.\r\n\r\nAlong the Talamanca coast calcareous deposits are found in horizontal\r\nlayers, and are probably elevated coral reefs, a rock which Professor\r\nGabb calls “antillite,” and which is developed in the entire\r\nCaribbean region. It belongs to the post-Pliocene formation, the last\r\nof the Tertiary series.\r\n\r\nIn the interior valleys a thick deposit of pebbles and clays of\r\nrecent origin is observed. The limit between the syenites of the\r\nhigh mountains and the metamorphosed Miocene formation is found in\r\nproximity to the Depuk River. In the slopes of the hills the schists\r\nare usually decomposed and covered with red clay, a sub-soil above\r\nwhich is found a small cap of fertile vegetable mold. In the valley\r\nof Tsuku the schists are profoundly altered and transformed in a\r\nmagnesic or semi-talcous rock. The schists are more silicified in\r\ncoming near to the limits of the syenites.\r\n\r\nHigher up, the granitic rocks extend in the direction of the Pico\r\nBlanco without interruption. The Pico Blanco itself is of granite.\r\nThree hundred feet below the summit porphyry is observed, while the\r\nsummit itself shows a greenish-brown trachyte with black spots.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Pacific side of this Talamanca section, Professor\r\nH. Pittier says, “The southern coast Cordillera, as a whole, is\r\nformed of a nucleus of basaltic or syenitic rocks, above which\r\nare found successively limestone in very deep banks and sometimes\r\nfossiliferous: then argillaceous and marly schists; again, sandstone\r\nand conglomerates, the latter forming generally the crests of the\r\nhills and giving way very easily to atmospheric action, which\r\nproduces its decomposition and is the cause of sterile lands\r\ncharacterized by savannas and the absence of forests on the upper\r\nparts of the mountains, as well as in certain lower and denuded\r\nparts. The conglomerates are made up of heterogeneous elements whose\r\nresistance to erosion is variable. Some disintegrate as soon as they\r\nare exposed to erosion, while others remain unaltered for a long\r\ntime. For this reason the savannas are in many places covered with\r\nstones of varied sizes.”\r\n\r\nThe lower valley of the Pirris presents a cap of impervious red clay,\r\nand, as the waters do not readily drain off they become stagnant and\r\nmake an unhealthy district.\r\n\r\nDr. Frantzius, referring to the same region, speaks of diorites and\r\nsyenites, also of calcareous deposits of the Miocene age covered with\r\nsandstone formations containing useful lignites. In his opinion the\r\nmountain of Dota is formed almost entirely of dioritic rocks with\r\nsome syenitic nucleus. The same scientist says further that the high\r\nplains of Caños Gordas are formed of conglomerates of ashes ejected\r\nby the volcano of Chiriqui and brought there by the trade-winds which\r\nprevail in Central America.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific slope, which comes boldly to the water’s edge, is\r\nmargined almost throughout by headlands and lofty hills, and has\r\nfewer evidences of extensive denudations and erosions than the\r\nAtlantic coast.\r\n\r\nThere is also a notable difference between the outlines of the two\r\ncoasts. The eastern is regular and slightly concave to the southwest,\r\nwhile the western is indented with large and small bays and gulfs.\r\n\r\nThe most northern of these bays is the Salinas, belonging partly\r\nto Nicaragua and partly to Costa Rica. It is a spacious deep-water\r\nharbor, overlooked by the volcanic peak of Orosi. It is separated\r\nfrom the adjoining bay, the Santa Elena, by Sacate Point.\r\n\r\nContinuing south, we come, south of Cacique Point, to Port Culebra,\r\nwhich is a mile wide, with a depth of eighteen fathoms. At the outlet\r\nof this harbor lies Cocos Bay, capacious enough for a thousand ships\r\nto anchor in the roadstead. The coast line south of Cocos Bay,\r\nbordered by numerous and lofty hills and cut into gorges by small\r\nimpetuous water courses, presents no harbor as far as Cape Blanco,\r\nwhich is at the western entrance of the extensive Gulf of Nicoya. The\r\ngulf extends fifty miles to the northwest and is a magnificent sheet\r\nof water, surrounded by green scenery, rivaling, if not surpassing,\r\nthat of the Bay of Naples, the Bosphorus, or the harbor of Rio de\r\nJaneiro. Some twenty islands, large and small, nearly all bold,\r\nrocky and covered with vegetation, contribute to its beauty, while\r\nmany small rivers, draining the slopes of the Miravalles and Tilaran\r\nsierras and the mountains of the peninsula of Nicoya, flow into it\r\nand diversify the scenery. The principal river, the Tempisque, enters\r\nat the head of the gulf, and with numerous small branches irrigates\r\nmuch of the province of Guanacaste.\r\n\r\nAll of the streams have bars at their mouths, composed generally of\r\nmud and broken shells, and but few of them are navigable even for\r\na short distance inland, and then by very small craft. The whole\r\neastern part of the peninsula of Nicoya is broken into hills and\r\nlow mountains, wild and rarely cultivated, although there are many\r\nbeautiful and fertile valleys. The west side of the gulf is full of\r\nreefs, rocks, violent currents, eddies that run from one to three\r\nand a half miles an hour, and is subject to violent squalls coming\r\nfrom the northwestern sierras. The eastern shore is less beset by\r\nobstructions, and small craft go along it with ease, and at high tide\r\npenetrate a few of its many rivers. It rises rapidly a short distance\r\ninland, but is at times bordered by mangrove swamps.\r\n\r\nNear the mouth of the river Aranjuez, on a sand spit three miles\r\nlong, stands Puntarenas, the only port of entry of Costa Rica on the\r\nPacific coast, and which had, from 1814 until recently, nearly the\r\nentire foreign trade of the country. Ocean vessels anchor from one to\r\ntwo miles off in the roadstead. There is an iron pier for loading and\r\ndischarging.\r\n\r\nFrom Puntarenas southward to the unnavigable Barranca River there is\r\na broad beach lying at the foot of the high escarpment of Caldera.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande de Tarcoles, which enters the gulf south of the\r\nBarranca, has a dangerous bar, but once inside it may be navigated\r\na few miles. Its upper waters irrigate the table-land of San José,\r\nAlajuela and Heredia. In the neighborhood of these towns is garnered\r\nnearly the entire coffee crop of Costa Rica. The coast line south\r\nis rocky and precipitous until near Punta Mala, or Judas, at the\r\nsoutheastern mouth of the gulf, and is low and surrounded by reefs\r\nand rocks.\r\n\r\nFrom Point Judas, low and covered with mangrove swamps, the coast\r\ntrends southeast in a long angular curve for about one hundred marine\r\nmiles to Point Llorena. It is dominated by lofty hills, cut through\r\nat intervals by short impetuous streams and a few estuaries. The only\r\nsafe and excellent anchorage in this one hundred miles is Uvita Bay,\r\nbehind a rocky reef. From the precipitous headline, called Punta\r\nLlorena, to Burica Point, the southern limit of Costa Rica, the coast\r\nis abrupt, soon rising into ridges and peaks from 300 to 700 meters\r\nhigh (985 to 2300 feet). These give birth to a few short turbulent\r\nstreams. About half way between these two points the great Golfo\r\nDulce, having a main width of six miles, penetrates inland northwest\r\nabout twenty-eight miles. It has an average depth of one hundred\r\nfathoms.\r\n\r\nCape Matapalo, which marks its western entrance, is deep and\r\nforest-covered, but Banco Point, opposite to it, is low. At the head\r\nof the gulf is found the little Bay of Rincon. From here to the\r\nEsquinas River, at the northeast angle of the gulf, the shore is\r\nhilly, and thence to the harbor of Golfito, which is surrounded by\r\nhigh hills, the country rises rapidly inland, but between Golfito\r\nand the entrance to the gulf it is lower and less broken, and thence\r\nto Platanal Point and Burica Point, the coast is bold, the country\r\ndescending gradually from the northeast.\r\n\r\nFrom Point Llorena to Point Burica the coast is wild and almost\r\nuninhabited. The coasts of Golfo Dulce have but a few hundred\r\nhalf-breeds as their sole occupants.\r\n\r\nThere are but two rivers in the long coast line from the Gulf of\r\nNicoya to the Golfo Dulce, the Rio Grande de Pirris, and the Rio\r\nGrande de Terraba, the head waters of the former flowing through\r\ndeep canyons with steep sides, which are almost bare of vegetation\r\nuntil the region of Guaitil is reached, where dense forests are\r\nencountered. The valley of the Rio Grande de Terraba is one of\r\nthe most beautiful, extensive and fertile of Costa Rica, but is\r\noccupied by only a few families. Formerly it was the home of a large\r\nindigenous population.\r\n\r\nIn the angle made by the River Buena Vista and Chirripo there is a\r\nvast ancient cemetery, the graves of which contain many ornaments of\r\ngold, principally eagles. An ancient road runs by near this place.\r\n\r\nTurning to the hydrographic basin of the San Juan River and Lake\r\nNicaragua, the northeastern slope of the Miravalles range is found to\r\nsend off several small streams to the lake.\r\n\r\nBetween Cuajiniquil, two and one-fourth miles east of Rio Sapoa, and\r\nTortuga, six miles further east, are the little streams, Lapita, El\r\nCangrejo, Puente de Piedra, La Vivora, Guabo, Genizaro and Tortuga,\r\nthe latter the greatest in volume, being about one hundred and sixty\r\nfeet wide at its mouth and navigable. In the further distance of\r\nseventeen miles going east, we cross the rivers Zavalos, Cañitas,\r\nQuesera, Mena, Mico, Sapotillo, Quijada, Quijadita, Santa Barbara,\r\nSardinia, Barreal, Cañas, Perrito and, finally, Las Haciendas\r\nwhich is navigable by small boats. From here to San Carlos, at the\r\noutlet of Lake Nicaragua, the distance is sixty-four kilometers,\r\nand the principal rivers which cross this tract are El Pizote,\r\nPapalusco, Guacolito, Zapote, Caño Negro and Rio Frio. The Rio Frio\r\nis of considerable magnitude, and with its many branches drains a\r\nlarge area of the territory lying on the slopes of the volcanoes\r\nof Miravalles and Tenorio. It pours much sedimentary matter into\r\nLake Nicaragua, and has thrown an extensive mudbank across the lake\r\nentrance to the River San Juan.\r\n\r\nFor three or four miles above the mouth of the River Frio the lands\r\nare low and swampy. Several of its branches can be reached and\r\nnavigated by canoe, and even a small river steamer can ascend a few\r\nmiles from the lake.\r\n\r\nThe San Carlos River joins the San Juan sixty-five miles from Lake\r\nNicaragua. The depth of its mouth, which is obstructed by a sand-bar,\r\nvaries from eight to twenty feet, according to the season.\r\n\r\nThe San Carlos has numerous affluents which at times have a volume of\r\nwater altogether disproportionate to their lengths. The distance up\r\nto the first rapid of the San Carlos River, which is at El Muelle de\r\nSan Rafael where there are from four to six feet of water is roughly\r\nfixed at sixty-two miles by the course of the river. Small steamers\r\ncould reach this point, although with difficulty on account of many\r\nsnags. The floods sometimes rise to their full height in twenty-four\r\nhours and carry with them a great number of trees and much sand, from\r\nwhich floating islands are formed.\r\n\r\nShould the plans of Engineer Menocal for the Nicaragua Canal be\r\nrealized, the waters of the upper San Juan and the lower San Carlos\r\nwould be impounded and form an arm of Lake Nicaragua, which would\r\nflood a large area in Costa Rica. The interval between the San Carlos\r\nand the River Frio is an extensive forest, covering an undulating\r\nplain with occasional low hills and watered by numerous little\r\nstreams. This territory is fertile and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe next great river, the Sarapiqui, reaches the San Juan about\r\ntwenty miles east of San Carlos. It is 600 feet wide at its mouth,\r\nand has numerous affluents from the sides of the volcanoes Poas,\r\nBarba and Irazú, the principal ones being the Toro Amarilla and\r\nSardinal from the west, and the River Sucio from the east. The river\r\nis navigable for large canoes up to its confluence with the Puerto\r\nViejo. Its banks as high up as to the River Sucio are low. The lands\r\nare extremely fertile. El Muelle Nuevo is the head of navigation,\r\nforty-five miles from the River San Juan and sixty-six miles by the\r\nroad across the mountains from San José.\r\n\r\nFrom the Sarapiqui River to the River Colorado, a branch or bayou of\r\nthe San Juan, the banks of the latter in Costa Rica are but slightly\r\nelevated. The lands are low and swampy, but occasionally a hill is\r\nfound from fifteen to eighteen feet high.\r\n\r\nBelow the Machuca Rapids the San Juan River is broad and deep as far\r\nas the junction with its Colorado outlet, about seventeen miles from\r\nthe sea. Here it turns about nine-tenths of its volume of water into\r\nthe Colorado. It is navigable for river steamers at all seasons, but\r\nhas a dangerous bar at its mouth where the sea breaks heavily, and on\r\nwhich there are only from eight to nine feet of water.\r\n\r\nFrom the Colorado Junction to Greytown, some twenty miles distant,\r\nthe San Juan averages about three hundred feet in width for sixteen\r\nmiles and 100 feet for the remaining four, with a depth at high water\r\nof from six to eight feet.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado has several islands in its course, but has excellent\r\nanchorage at its mouth. This river forms several lagoons which\r\ncommunicate with each other by caños or bayous perfectly navigable,\r\nthe principal being the Agua Dulce, a short distance from the sea,\r\neleven miles in length, 800 feet in width and from ten to forty feet\r\nin depth.\r\n\r\nPassing from the difficult Caño de la Palma in the midst of swamps,\r\nthe Caño de Tortuguero is reached, the entrance to which from the\r\nsea is called Cuatro Esquinas. It is approximately thirty-eight\r\nmiles long, about one thousand feet in width, with a depth of from\r\nfifty to sixty feet. The rivers Palacio and Penetencia, navigable\r\nfor boats, empty into this caño. The River Tortuguero, which gives\r\nname to the plains watered by its affluents, is formed from several\r\nof these caños, as the Caño Desenredo, Caño Agua Fria and Caño de la\r\nLomas. The Caño de Tortuguero communicates with the Parismina by the\r\ncaños California and Francisco Moria Soto, which are also navigable.\r\nThe margins of the Parismina are swampy. It has as its affluents the\r\nGuasimo, Camaron, Novillos and the Destierro.\r\n\r\nThe lower district drained by the Tortuguero is raised but little\r\nabove the ocean, and in flood time the river communicates by several\r\ncaños with the Matina and with the delta of the Colorado, as well as\r\nwith the lagoon of Caiman, lying south of the Colorado. Its numerous\r\nupper streams rise in the spurs of Irazú and Turialba.\r\n\r\nThe Sierpe and Parismina rivers flow into the sea south of\r\nTortuguero. The former is short, but the Parismina with its several\r\nbranches is a child of Irazú. Its lower course is sometimes\r\nconsidered to be a part of the River Reventazon, which however has\r\nits confluence with the former a few miles from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Reventazon River has carved its way to a profound depth around\r\nthe south and southeastern bases of Irazú and Turialba, and, flanking\r\nthe latter volcano, it turns northward to join the Parismina. It\r\nreceives many tributaries from the northern slope of the Talamanca\r\nrange, and interweaves its head waters with those of the Rio Grande\r\nde Tarcolles and the Rio Grande de Pirris, which flow into the\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Pacuare River, once known as Suerre, enters the sea about half\r\nway between the mouth of the Reventazon and that of the Matina.\r\nIts waters, in 1630, instead of flowing to the sea, joined the\r\nReventazon, closing the port of Suerre, but in 1651 Governor Salinas\r\nclosed the northern channel, deflecting its waters and restoring the\r\nport.\r\n\r\nThe Matina River is a short stream with a large volume of water,\r\nwhich enters the sea just north of Port Limon near the roadstead of\r\nMoin, where, up to 1880, ocean craft anchored. The River Matina is\r\nnavigable by small steamers over the bar and by large ones above\r\nthe bar to the point where it receives its principal affluents,\r\nthe Chirripo, Barbilla and Zent. It yearly overflows its lower\r\nvalley, depositing an inch or two of exceedingly fertile mud highly\r\nappreciated by the banana planters.\r\n\r\nThe entire mainland of the coast, from the River Colorado to the\r\nMatina, is separated from the Caribbean Sea by a continuous narrow\r\nsand bank, between which and the mainland is a lagoon, said to be\r\nnavigable the whole distance by boats. The intermediate rivers pour\r\ninto this narrow lagoon, driving their currents across it, and,\r\ncutting through the sand bank, enter the sea. Sometimes a violent\r\ngale closes one of the openings, which are all shallow, but the\r\nriver again forces an exit to the ocean through the obstruction.\r\nThis whole coast for sixty-five miles, is forbidding and dangerous,\r\nand has but little depth of water within a mile of the shore, upon\r\nwhich a monotonous, heavy surf breaks during the entire year. It is\r\nonly frequented from April until August by fishermen, who find their\r\nway to the River San Juan through the intricate system of rivers and\r\ncaños described.\r\n\r\nPort Limon, in latitude 10° north and longitude 83° 3′ 13″ west from\r\nGreenwich, is the only port of entry of Costa Rica on the Caribbean\r\nSea. The first house was built there in 1871. The harbor faces\r\nthe south, and is formed by a little peninsula on which Limon is\r\nsituated. It is behind a narrow coral reef. The site, which now has\r\nperhaps 3500 to 4000 population, is being raised with earth about\r\nfour feet, and its port will become one of the smoothest of the\r\nCaribbean Sea. A small island, called Uvita, lies east at a distance\r\nof 3660 feet from the town. Port Limon has a wooden pier 930 feet\r\nlong, accommodating two sea-going ships, but an iron pier is about to\r\nreplace it, which will berth four large ones of deep draught.\r\n\r\nThe Talamanca coast lying south of Limon is low, flat and swampy,\r\nexcept where it is broken by hills. The little River Banana is\r\nthe first one met with going south, and its valleys produce large\r\nquantities of timber and bananas. Next comes the Estrella, also a\r\nshort stream; then follows the Teliri, called in its lower course the\r\nSicsola. It is the largest stream in Costa Rica south of Port Limon.\r\nIt runs along the southern base of the great eastern mountains of the\r\nTalamanca range, through a spacious, undulating, wooded valley of 100\r\nto 150 square miles area, partly low grounds in some places dry and\r\nin others swampy. It has several branches, like the Uren coming from\r\nthe slopes of the Pico Blanco, the Supurio and others. At the entry\r\nof the high valleys of the Teliri and Coen rivers, the pyramid-like\r\nmountains of Nefomin and Nenfiobete appear, at the foot of which the\r\ninterior plain of Talamanca, fifteen kilometers in length and eight\r\nkilometers in width, extends from southwest to northeast, and so\r\nuniformly that the water courses run indifferently and frequently\r\nchange their beds.\r\n\r\nSouthward of Sicsola is the Tilorio or Changuinola, which makes a\r\nturbulent way to the sea from the Talamanca mountains. Along its\r\nlower margin mud flats spread to a great width, and, from its mouth\r\ntowards the northwest, cover a region which surrounds also the lagoon\r\nof Sansan, and extends up the rivers Zhorquin and Sicsola. Behind the\r\nmuddy zone the lands rise rapidly into hills, which in a few miles\r\nreach an altitude of several thousand feet, at times intermingling\r\nwith the Cordillera. Along the entire sea margin of Talamanca runs a\r\nnarrow sand-belt of firm land, at times not a hundred feet wide, like\r\nthat described between the Matina and San Juan rivers.\r\n\r\nWithin this sand-belt are long, narrow, deep lagoons filled with\r\nhalf-stagnant water from the mud flats. These lagoons usually open\r\ninto the rivers which descend from the mountains.\r\n\r\nBetween the Sicsola and the Tilorio lies the already mentioned,\r\ncrooked and deep lagoon called the Laguna de Sansan.\r\n\r\nAt Limon, Cahuita and Puerto Viejo, the hills, which are connected by\r\nspurs with the more elevated country of the interior, extend to the\r\nocean coast. Between them, in plains extending from one to five miles\r\ninland, are forest-covered swamps, overflowed with not less than ten\r\nfeet of water in the rainy season and only traversable in the dry.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica claims sovereignty on the Atlantic side southeast as far\r\nas the Island of Escudo de Veragua, including the ancient Ducado de\r\nVeragua, whose frontier follows the coast of Chiriqui Viejo to the\r\ncrest of the Cordillera, and crosses it to the head waters of the\r\nRiver Calobebora, then down this stream to the Escudo de Veragua.\r\n\r\nSince their independence Colombia and Costa Rica have been in dispute\r\nin regard to their boundary line. Colombia has never ceased to claim\r\njurisdiction over the entire Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, and\r\neven over that of Nicaragua as far north as Cape Gracias á Dios. In\r\nNovember, 1896, both governments signed a convention submitting their\r\ndispute to the arbitration of the President of the French Republic,\r\nor, in the event of his failure to act, to the President of Mexico or\r\nof the Swiss Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe principal lakes of Costa Rica are the Laguna Manatí, northwest\r\nfrom the Sarapiqui River; the Lagunas de Poas and de Barba, each on\r\na volcano bearing its name; Lagunas de Sansan and Samay, towards the\r\neast and near the Sicsola River, in Talamanca; Laguna Tenoria, in\r\nGuanacaste; Laguna San Carlos, in the plains of San Carlos; Laguna de\r\nArenal, between Las Cañas and San Carlos, and Laguna de Sierpe, in\r\nthe south, northward from the Golfo Dulce.\r\n\r\nFar away from Costa Rica, in the Pacific Ocean, lies the Cocos\r\nIsland, about two hundred and sixty-six miles to the southwest of the\r\nGolfo Dulce, in N. latitude 5° 32′ 57″ and longitude 86° 58′ 25″ W.\r\nof Greenwich. Its highest point reaches 2250 feet, whence the descent\r\nis gradual to a bold, steep coast, which has many irregularities and\r\nrocks and a surf-beaten shore. Chatham Bay is its best harbor, having\r\nroom for a dozen ships. The interior is broken into numerous fertile\r\nvalleys, but there is probably not a square kilometer of level ground\r\nin the entire island. Other islands are Chira, Venado, San Lucas,\r\nCaño, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mineral Wealth._—In regard to the mineral wealth of Costa Rica,\r\npetroleum has been discovered near Uruchiko on the Talamanca coast,\r\nand coal in certain sandstone formations on both the Atlantic and\r\nPacific sides of the Talamanca section.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Alajuela, a little to the north of the cart-road\r\nwhich runs from San José to Puentarenas, is Monte Aguacate, part\r\nof an old mountain range which extends far to the northwest, and\r\nnot very distant from the Gulf of Nicoya. In general, it is of\r\nmetamorphic formation, principally of diorite and porphyry.\r\n\r\nHere, in a good climate, at 2000 feet elevation, are found auriferous\r\nveins of great richness. They are of quartz mixed with decomposed\r\nfeldspathic rocks, and have yielded very lucrative bonanzas. The\r\nfirst mine was Guapinol, one bonanza of which produced $1,000,000.\r\nSeveral other mines were worked, from one of which (Los Castros)\r\n$2,000,000 were taken in a few years. It is estimated, from the best\r\ndata obtainable, that about £1,000,000 have been taken from Monte\r\nAguacate. Several of these veins are from six to seven feet wide, but\r\nthat called the Quebrada Honda is sixteen feet wide. Most of the ore\r\nis of a high grade and of refractory character. It is probable that\r\nthe whole southwestern slope of the Guatusos and Miravalles ranges of\r\nmountains is auriferous. The rocks in the northwestern extension of\r\nthis district consist principally of feldspar, porphyry, basalt and\r\ndolorite.\r\n\r\nThe gold veins nearly all ran northeast and southwest, and are\r\nencased in feldspar, sometimes in porphyry, and occasionally in\r\nbasalt. They consist, in great part, of crystalline quartz, and are\r\nfrom two to forty feet wide. Professor Pittier also found gold in\r\nthe slopes of the Buena Vista mountain. Gold is further found in the\r\nTalamanca mountains, especially in the placer grounds of the Duedi\r\nRiver, and on the inferior hills between the Lari and Coen rivers.\r\n\r\nAlong the latter, and near Akbeta, also on the shore of Puerto Viejo,\r\niron exists.\r\n\r\nCopper and silver, Professor Pittier says, have been discovered in\r\nDiquis, between Paso Real and Lagarto, and native copper in Puriscal.\r\nOther mines are included in the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Principal Mines Registered in 1892.\r\n\r\n  --------------------+----------+----------------------+-----------------\r\n    Name of Mine.     | Canton.  |  Location.           |    Product.\r\n  --------------------+----------+----------------------+-----------------\r\n  La Trinidad         |Esparza   |Rio Ciruelitas        |Gold and\r\n                      |          |                      |     silver ores.\r\n  La Union            |Puntarenas|Shores of Rio Seco    |  ”      ”\r\n  Sacrafamilia        |Alajuela  |Monte de Aguacate     |  ”      ”\r\n  La Minita           |    ”     |     ”        ”       |  ”      ”\r\n  Mina de los Castros |    ”     |Corralillo            |  ”      ”\r\n  San Rafael          |    ”     |     ”                |  ”      ”\r\n  Mina de los Oreamuno|    ”     |     ”                |  ”      ”\r\n  Quebrada Honda      |    ”     |Quebrada Honda        |  ”      ”\r\n  Machuca             |    ”     |Corralillo            |  ”      ”\r\n  Trinidad de Aguacate|    ”     |      ”               |  ”      ”\r\n  Peña Grande         |San Ramon |Cerro de San Ramon    |  ”      ”\r\n  Mina de Acosta      |    ”     |Shores of Rio Jesus   |  ”      ”\r\n  Palmares            |    ”     |Cordillera de Aguacate|Gold, silver and\r\n                      |          |                      |  lead ores.\r\n  Las Concavas        |Cartago   |Rio de Agua Caliente  |Copper ore.\r\n  Mancuerna           |Sardinal  |Sardinal              |     ”\r\n  Mata Palo           |    ”     |      ”               |     ”\r\n  Puerta de Palacio   |    ”     |      ”               |     ”\r\n  Hoja Chiques        |    ”     |      ”               |     ”\r\n  Chapernal           |    ”     |      ”               |     ”\r\n  --------------------+----------+----------------------+-----------------\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that, with the exception of gold and some silver,\r\nlittle is mined. The deposits of coal, petroleum, copper and silver\r\nhave thus far yielded, under present methods of management, outputs\r\nof no commercial value.\r\n\r\nHowever, anthracite is found at Santa Maria Dota, Department of\r\nPuriscal.

The maximum occurs regularly during the months\r\nfrom October to March inclusive, at nine o’clock a. m., and during\r\nthe rest of the year at eleven o’clock p. m. The minimum occurs\r\nalways in the afternoon at four o’clock during the first eight months\r\nof the year, and at three o’clock during the last four months.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing wind is from the northeast, or, better,\r\nnorth-northeast and east. During August, September and October an\r\nincrease of the northwest winds causes the heavy rains of that\r\nseason. West-northwest and northwest winds blow also from May to\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nThe daily variation of winds is generally as follows:\r\n\r\nAt seven a. m. the most frequent winds blow from S. E., to N. E.;\r\nat ten o’clock a. m. from E. to N. N. E; at one o’clock and at four\r\no’clock p. m. from E. N. E. to N.; from seven o’clock p. m. the\r\nmovement is retrograde. The velocity is least from seven to ten\r\no’clock a. m., and most from one to four o’clock p. m.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, during the time of observations at San José, there were\r\nnoted 13 hours of north winds, 186 N. N. E., 571 N. E., 227 E. N. E.,\r\n93 E., 58 E. S. E., 25 S. E., 6 S. S. E., S. none, S. S. W. none, 1\r\nS. W., 3 W. S. W., 4 W., 83 W. N. W.\r\n\r\nThe number of calms is small. The wind is nearly always moderate,\r\nbut during the dry season the dust whirled up in the cities is very\r\ndisagreeable. The climate of the uplands is an eternal spring.\r\n\r\nThe coldest month is January; December and February are relatively\r\ncold. The hottest months are May and June. The heat is, at all\r\ntimes, moderate and agreeable. The course of the temperature has\r\nall the characters of an insular climate, without having so much\r\nhumidity. The oscillation of the average temperature is greatest in\r\nMarch and during the dry season, as at that time the sky is clear\r\nand the soil exposed to uninterrupted insolation during the day,\r\nwhile the earth’s radiation of heat during the night is rapid. Also\r\nthe daily oscillation is considerable during the dry season, and\r\ncontinues during the first month of the rainy season, according to\r\nthe condition of the sky.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the sun shone in San José 1911 hours, that is an average of\r\nfive hours and fourteen minutes per day. February is the month of\r\nmost sunshine and least nebulosity. The hour of most sunshine during\r\nthe year is that between eight and nine a. m., and that of the least\r\nis in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe oscillation of the temperature of the soil is, at a depth of\r\none meter, 2, 13° C., per year. At a depth of three meters, the\r\ntemperature of the soil is lowest in February and March, when it is\r\n20, 48° C., and highest in August, when it is 20, 75° C.\r\n\r\nThe daily variation is almost nothing during the first three months\r\nof the year, and the sky is relatively clear, while, from May to\r\nOctober, not one day is clear. During the hottest hours of the day\r\nthe sky begins regularly to be darkened by clouds, due to ascending\r\natmospheric currents.\r\n\r\nIn San José the sky is ordinarily clear between midnight and noon,\r\neven during the most rainy months, and cloudy the rest of the\r\ntwenty-four hours. Although the rainfalls are abundant here from May\r\nto October, with rare exceptions they do not last more than a few\r\nhours each day. The mornings are generally splendid and the air very\r\npure, and nearly every day the sunset can be clearly observed.\r\n\r\nFrom May to November there are about two hours of copious rain daily\r\nbetween one and four o’clock in the afternoon, averaging, with great\r\nregularity, from ten to twelve inches a month, and from seventy to\r\neighty inches during the year. Towards the end of June there is a\r\nshort dry period called “Veranillo de San Juan.”\r\n\r\nThrough the Desengaño and Palma Passes the northern rains penetrate\r\na short distance every day, and the northern descent of the Palma\r\ntowards Carillo is probably the most rainy district of the Republic.\r\n\r\nAt Tres Rios, having an elevation of 4140 feet, six miles east of San\r\nJosé, at the western foot of the Ochomogo Pass, the rain record for\r\n126 days out of ten months showed a fall of 100 inches, while at San\r\nJosé, during the same period of ten months there were 147 rainy days,\r\nwith a fall of eighty-four inches. In the month of May Professor\r\nPittier, to whom we owe these excellent data, measured nine inches in\r\nrainfall in one and one-half hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nRainfall in 1896 at Stations of Costa Rica of Different Altitudes, by\r\nDays and Precipitation in Mm.\r\n\r\n         (Part 1 of 3)\r\n  --------------+--------+----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n                |Altitude|   Jan.   |   Feb.   |   Mch.   |  April.  |\r\n                |   in   +-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+\r\n                | meters |Days.| mm.|Days.| mm.|Days.| mm.|Days.| mm.|\r\n  --------------+--------+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+\r\n  Boca del Rio  |        |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |\r\n    Banana      |    3   |  15 | 292|  16 | 184|  17 | 140|  24 |1030|\r\n  Port Limon    |    3   |  ?

Rain begins to fall about eleven o’clock,\r\nand continues to augment rapidly from hour to hour until it reaches\r\nits maximum between four and five o’clock p. m.; from this time on\r\nit diminishes gradually until morning. The daily maximum of rain is\r\nreached about sunset, although in January the heaviest rainfalls are\r\nobserved between one and two o’clock p. m. The most probable hour of\r\nrain is between four and five o’clock p. m. It seldom rains between\r\nthree and four o’clock, and very seldom during the morning hours.\r\n\r\nThunderstorms reach their maximum in May. The relative humidity of\r\nthe air is such that the climate can be considered a favored one.\r\nIts annual curve shows three minima and three maxima. The minima are\r\nobserved between February and March, in July, and between November\r\nand December; the maxima in June, September and December. These\r\nlines, of course, are parallel with those indicating the distribution\r\nof rain. The maximum is noted at sunrise, the minimum at two o’clock\r\np. m., with an average oscillation of twenty-four per cent.\r\n\r\nFrom 1866 to 1880, the rain gauge record kept by Mason at San José\r\nshows a yearly average precipitation of sixty-four and one-fourth\r\ninches, or 1631 millimeters.\r\n\r\nIt is as follows:\r\n\r\n  The Rainfall in San José from 1866 to 1880 in Mm.\r\n\r\n  -------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\r\n         |  J |  F |  M |  A.|  M |  J |  J |  A |  S |  O |  N |  D |   T\r\n         |  a |  e |  a |  p |  a |  u |  u |  u |  e |  c |  o |  e |   o\r\n         |  n.|  b.|  r.|  r |  y.|  n |  l |  g.|  p |  t.|  v.|  c.|   t\r\n         |    |    |    |  i |    |  e.|  y.|    |  t.|    |    |    |   a\r\n         |    |    |    |  l.|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |   l.\r\n  -------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\r\n  1866   |  33|   7| -- |  29| 139| 123| 320| 156| 274| 250| 171| 122| 1619\r\n  1867   |  98|  56|  7 |  98| 209| 206| 214| 190| 314| 213| 244|  14| 1397\r\n  1868   |  --|  --| 181|  13|  83| 150| 102| 130| 224| 393| 144|  17| 1436\r\n  1869   |   7|  --|   7|  28| 202| 218| 150| 132| 393| 281|  78| 102| 1562\r\n  1870   |   1|   6|  31|  17| 333| 276| 240| 284| 240| 262| 184|  33| 1905\r\n  1871   |  28|   3|   8|  13| 290| 203| 364| 307| 245| 333| 114|  11| 1925\r\n  1872   |   3|   3|  15|  50| 244| 255| 192| 378| 397| 504| 142|  21| 2197\r\n  1873   |  64|  --|   3|  71| 64 | 205| 145|  85| 387| 262| 121|  11| 1418\r\n  1874   |  46|   1|  20|  60| 336| 167| 162| 181| 319| 191|  42|  20| 1543\r\n  1875   |  --|  --|  --|  28| 252| 180|  93| 294| 279| 339|  21|  32| 1492\r\n  1876   |  14|  --|  11|   6| 247| 237| 153| 192| 206| 117|  70|  28| 1282\r\n  1877   |  14|  --|  --|  --| 240| 167| 223| 159| 259|  95| 121|  79| 1357\r\n  1878   |  --|  --|  38|  50| 142| 187| 205| 149| 329| 238| 223|  20| 1580\r\n  1879   |  13|  --|  45| 192| 220| 330| 460| 283| 351| 231|  61|   8| 2193\r\n  1880   |   8|  --|  --|  15| 254| 210| 104| 436| 165| 278|  92|  --| 1562\r\n  -------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\r\n  Average|  22|   5|  24|  44| 217| 208| 208| 222| 299| 266| 122|  35| 1631\r\n  -------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\r\n\r\nThere is every year a number of slight earthquakes in San José,\r\ngenerally undulating from west to west-northwest, and occurring\r\nmostly between eleven p. m. and six a. m. The greatest number are\r\nobserved at the beginning of the rainy season.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season on the Caribbean slope of the country does not\r\ncorrespond to that of the Pacific. In fact there are no continuously\r\ndry months, and on the northern declivities of the volcanoes of\r\nTurialba, Irazú, Barba and Poas, it rains more or less during the\r\nentire year; also near Lake Nicaragua it rains nearly continuously,\r\nand the mountains of the Guatuso country and the surroundings of\r\nthe volcano of Orosi are seldom without clouds. At times there are\r\ncloud-bursts of tremendous power, broadening rivers for miles. Port\r\nLimon is said to have an annual rainfall of eighty-nine inches, but\r\nit is greatly exceeded by that of Colon, which averages 120 inches.\r\nThe mean rainfall at Greytown for 1890, 1891, 1892, was 267 inches\r\nyearly. The late United States Commission estimated the average at\r\nLake Nicaragua at eighty inches, and in the basin of the San Juan\r\nRiver at 150 inches.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Talamanca is for the same reason very unhealthy in the\r\nproximity of the coast, and also in the lower course of the rivers\r\na similarly deadly climate prevails. In normal years there are two\r\ndry and two wet seasons. The rains commence regularly in May or June\r\nand last until the end of July. The months of August and September\r\nare more or less dry. In October there are some heavy showers, and\r\nextensive rains begin which characterize the months of November,\r\nDecember and January. The driest months are February, March and\r\nApril. The high region is extremely humid, giving rise to fogs and\r\nrains. The mosses which almost completely envelop the stems of the\r\ntrees are constantly dropping water, and the rivers in this section\r\nare almost impassable.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the great valley of the Rio Grande de Terraba is\r\nsimilar to that described for the terrace lands. Both regions have\r\ndistinctly marked characters. Rains begin in April, grow heavier\r\ntowards September, and cease about the end of November. During the\r\nrest of the year dry weather prevails, although sometimes heavy\r\nshowers relieve this arid condition. In the lower zone pronounced\r\nradiation causes a heavy dew and extensive fogs, and both are\r\ncharacteristic of this section.\r\n\r\nThe excessive heat felt on the lowlands diminishes gradually with the\r\nrising of the land towards the high mountains, but at times a height\r\nof 1500 feet will be found cooler than one of 3000 feet. In the Santa\r\nClara district, for instance, it is cooler at 500 feet elevation than\r\nit is in the Reventazon valley at 1500 feet. In general, the torrid\r\nlands of the country, ranging from the sea to 150 feet above it, and,\r\nif not clear and well-drained, even up to 400 and 500 feet, abound\r\nin malarial fevers; but as high ground, having an elevation of from\r\n1500 to 3000 feet is reached, the fevers are of light type and not\r\ndangerous, while from 3000 to 5000 feet the diseases are those of\r\nthe temperate zone, and are due less to local conditions of soil and\r\nclimate than to personal neglect.\r\n\r\nThere were no epidemic diseases in 1897. In October 30, 1894, sixteen\r\nmedical districts were established by law, and so were a number of\r\nhospitals and quarantine stations in the ports of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF VEGETATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter I begin with a phyto-geographical classification\r\ngiven by Dr. Carl Hoffman and published in Bonplandia in 1858. He\r\ndistinguishes:\r\n\r\n  First.—Coast regions (sea shores and salt swamps).\r\n\r\n  Second.—Regions of tropical forests and savannas, stretching from\r\n  the coast regions to a height of 900 meters.\r\n\r\n  Third.—Regions of high plains, lying between 900 to 1500 meters of\r\n  elevation.\r\n\r\n  Fourth.—Region of upper tropical forests, situated between 1500 to\r\n  2150 meters of altitude.\r\n\r\n  Fifth.—Region of oaks, from 2150 to 2750 meters in height.\r\n\r\n  Sixth.—Region of chaparrales, from 2750 to 3050 meters up.\r\n\r\n  Seventh.—Region of subalpine or subandine flora, from 3050 meters\r\n  up to the tops of the high mountains.\r\n\r\nDr. Polakowsky enumerates cultivated lands, virgin forests, open\r\nforests and savannas.\r\n\r\nAnother division is given by Dr. Moritz Wagner. He mentions a\r\nlittoral (as appears on next page) zone, a tropical forest zone and a\r\nzone of savannas.\r\n\r\nHe also distinguishes on the volcano of Chiriqui the following\r\nsuccessive regions:\r\n\r\n  First.—Regions of evergreen forest trees and palms, bananas,\r\n  Araceæ, etc., to a height of 550 meters, with an average\r\n  temperature of 26° to 24° C.\r\n\r\n  Second.—Region of tree ferns and mountain orchids, from 550 to 1220\r\n  meters, with an average temperature of 23° to 18° C.\r\n\r\n  Third.—Region of Rosaceæ, Senecionodeæ, Gramineæ and Agave\r\n  americana, from 1220 to 1585 meters.\r\n\r\n  Fourth.—Region of Cupuliferæ and Betulaceæ, mostly oaks and alders,\r\n  from 1585 to 3050 meters.\r\n\r\n  Fifth.—Higher region above 3050 meters.\r\n\r\nDr. Wagner calls special attention to a noted uniformity of the flora\r\non the coasts of both oceans, and Professor Pittier affirms that\r\nthe vegetation between Colon and Greytown on one side, and between\r\nPanama and San Juan del Sur on the other side, is remarkably uniform.\r\nThe littoral zone has a width of about four maritime miles. The\r\npredominating flora is composed of _Rhizophora mangle_, _Hippomane\r\nmancinella_, _Cocos nucifera_, _Chrysobalanus icaco_, _Crescentia\r\ncujete_, _Acacia spadicigera_, _Cæsalpinia bonducella_ and other\r\n_Leguminosæ_; _Acrostichum aureum_, _Ipomœa pescapræ_, _Avicennia\r\nnitida_, _Uniola Pittierii_ and also _Euphorbiaceæ_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe zone of tropical forests shows, especially on the Atlantic\r\nside behind the coast region, a strip of from twenty to twenty-two\r\nmiles in width, with lofty trees of _Rubiaceæ_, _Myrtaceæ_,\r\n_Melastomaceæ_, _Sterculiaceæ_, _Euphorbiaceæ_, _Meliaceæ_,\r\n_Urticaceæ_, _Moraceæ_, _Anacardiacæ_, _Sapindaceæ_, _Leguminosæ_ and\r\n_Palmæ_. It is relatively free from ligneous undergrowth, having more\r\nmonocotyledonous plants, such as _Cycadeæ_, _Scitamineæ_, _Cannaceæ_,\r\n_Marantaceæ_, _Cyperaceæ_, _Filices_ and _Bromeliaceæ_, underneath.\r\nThe latter orders figure, also with _Orchideæ_ and _Loranthaceæ_\r\namong the epiphytes and parasites which cover the trees. Among\r\nthe most characteristic plants of this region we name the coyol\r\npalm (_Acrocomia_), corozo (_Attalea cohune_), biscoyol (_Bactris\r\nhorrida_), palmiche (_Elæis melanococca_) and _Raphia nicaraguensis_\r\nwhich forms almost forests along the River San Juan; further, _Tecoma\r\npentaphylla_, _Bombax ceiba_, _Eriodendron_, _Spondias_, _Croton\r\ngossypifolius_, _Hymenæa courbaril_, rubber trees (_Castilloa\r\ncostaricencis_ and _C. elastica_), _Geoffræa superba_, _Simaba\r\ncedron_, species of _Enterolobium_, _Cæsalpinia_, _Liquidambar_,\r\n_Copaifera_, _Cedrela_, _Swietenia_, _Sapota_, _Pithecolobium_,\r\n_Palicourea_, _Cinchona_, _Piper_, _Ficus_, _Cecropia_; still\r\nfurther, smilax, vanilla, etc. Many of these characteristic plants\r\nare largely social, such as the piper, ferns, palms and others.\r\n\r\nMoritz Wagner states that all along the southern limits of Costa\r\nRica a likeness of climatic and geological conditions gives to the\r\nvegetation a nearly uniform character, while further northward a\r\nnotable contrast is observed between the Atlantic and Pacific slopes\r\nof the mountain groups and on the interior terrace lands. The\r\nAtlantic slope, with more constant humidity of air, is characterized\r\nby vast, dense, evergreen, virgin forests, while the Pacific lands,\r\nwith a relatively dry climate and rainless summer, present more open\r\nforests and savannas, with many deciduous trees and shrubs. However,\r\ndeep river valleys and some slopes near the water-shed have dense,\r\nevergreen forests, and their vegetation does not differ much from\r\nthat of the Atlantic slope. The flora of the high terrace lands has\r\nbeen so altered by thorough cultivation as to have almost lost its\r\noriginal character.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic virgin forests, as well as those in the region of the\r\nSan Juan River and of Lake Nicaragua, which comprise two-thirds of\r\nCosta Rican territory, show such a dense vegetation that its interior\r\ncan be penetrated almost only by way of the rivers, and its general\r\ncharacter and its enormous extension be studied only from high\r\nmountains. Owing to the very mountainous character of the country,\r\nover half of its area lies between 900 and 2100 meters above the sea,\r\nand is almost wholly covered with virgin forest. This forest here\r\nand there ascends still higher, reaching the upper limit of the oak\r\nregion about 2700 meters above the sea.\r\n\r\nDr. Polakowsky, in an interesting publication entitled “Flora of\r\nCosta Rica,” calls the forest region of the San Juan River, in view\r\nof its luxuriant character, “The Central American Hylæa,” and this\r\nname Professor Pittier applies also to the entire Atlantic region,\r\nattributing to it a distinctly South American character.\r\n\r\nThe zone of the open forests and savannas, which has park-like\r\nfeatures, is rarely found away from the Pacific side, where it forms\r\na belt from sixteen to eighteen miles in width, interspersed with\r\nmore densely forested river valleys, islands of higher and thicker\r\nvirgin forests, isolated trees or groups of trees, sometimes also\r\nwith _catingas_ and meadows flecked with shrubs and matorrales.\r\n\r\nThe savannas and open forests spread to a considerable extent over\r\nGuanacaste, where they are a continuation of those of Rivas in\r\nNicaragua; also over the plains of Terraba, especially in the region\r\nof Buenos Aires and Terraba; and over the coast-lands of Golfo Dulce.\r\nThere are some small similar tracts near Alajuela, Turialba, Santa\r\nClara and at some other points, as well as catingas and _paramos_ in\r\nthe high mountain ridges of the south. The paramos are found on poor\r\nsoil and have a vegetation more herbaceous than ligneous, which, when\r\nmoist, takes on the character of turf.\r\n\r\nThe trees of the savannas are generally of little height, excepting\r\nthe _Enterolobium cyclocarpum_ (the guanacaste), the pochote and\r\nceiba. The grass lands are almost wholly composed of _Gramineæ_\r\nand _Cyperaceæ_, especially in the savannas of Guanacaste. The\r\nmost characteristic plants are _Digitaria marginata_ and _Paspalum\r\nnotatum_, besides species of _Setaria_, _Panicum_, _Eragrostis_,\r\n_Andropogon_, _Isolepis_, _Cyperus_, _Rhynchospora_ and _Scleria_, as\r\nwell as of ferns (_Pteris aquilina_) and _Schizæa occidentalis_.\r\n\r\nOther abundant plants in the open forests and savannas are\r\n_Compositæ_ (_Zemenia_, _Pectis_, _Spilanthes_); _Rubiaceæ_\r\n(_Spermacoce_); _Polygalaceæ_; _Iridaceæ_; _Moraceæ_ (_Maclura_,\r\n_Ficus_); _Melastomaceæ_ (_Miconia_, _Clidemia_, _Conostegia_,\r\n_Leandra_); _Cyperaceæ_; _Convolvulaceæ_; _Euphorbiaceæ_;\r\n_Bombacaceæ_; _Sauvagesia_. Further, _Myrtaceæ_ (_Psidium_,\r\n_Alibertia edulis_); _Curatella americana_ (chamico); _Roupala_\r\n(danto hedliondo); _Byrsonima crassifolia_ (nance); _Miconia argentea\r\nDC._ (santa maria); guacimo macho (_Luhea_), guacimo de ternero\r\n(_Guazuma ulmifolia_); burio (_Bombax apeiba_); ñambar (_Cocobola_);\r\n_Davilla lucida_; _Duranta Plumieri_; _Proteaceæ_; and _Acacia\r\nscleroxyla Lonchocarpus atropurpureus,_ _Dalbergia_ and many other\r\n_Leguminosæ_, especially _Mimosa pudica_, which gives large tracts in\r\nmany places a special character, and still more so as, being often\r\nvery abundant and the plants tangled together, a general movement all\r\naround is caused when one is touched.\r\n\r\nAmong the epiphytes and parasites may be mentioned small ferns,\r\n_Peperomia_, _Epidendrum_, _Loranthus_, _Aroideæ_, _Tillandsia_ and\r\nother _Bromeliaceæ_, mosses, lichens, etc.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pittier attributes to this flora of the Pacific slope a\r\nmore northern origin.\r\n\r\nDuring the dry season the vegetation of the savannas almost\r\ndisappears, the greater part of the trees and bushes shed their\r\nleaves and herbs become dry and brittle. Only along the rivers is\r\nsome freshness observable. Toward the border of Nicaragua cacti\r\nappear, mostly species of _Cereus_, _Opuntia_, _Phypsalis_ and\r\n_Mammilaria_. Professor Pittier also mentions an oak forest of\r\n_Quercus citrifolia_ between Liberia and the Rio de los Ahogados, at\r\na height of about one hundred meters above the sea. The peninsula\r\nof Nicoya is noted for a large lumber industry among its different\r\ncedars (_Cedro dulce_, _C. amargo_, _C. real_, etc.), mora and other\r\ntrees. Towards the upper limits of the Atlantic tropical forests,\r\nbelow the oak region, _Chamædorea_, _Geonoma_, _Bactris_, _Euterpe\r\nlongepetiolata_ and other palms of the same groups, as well as\r\n_Gulielma utilis_ (the pijivalle palm) and _Carludovica microphylla_\r\nare seen in great abundance, mixed with tree ferns like _Alsophylla\r\npruinata_, _Hemitelia horrida_, _Hemitelia grandifolia_, etc. Higher\r\nup appears the region of oaks, principally _Quercus retusa_, _Quercus\r\ngranulata_, _Quercus citrifolia_ and _Quercus costaricensis_, with\r\n_Buddleia alpina_, _Rubus_, _Lupinus_, etc. Here is also the region\r\nof the common potato. This oak region slopes gradually down from\r\neast to west. The vegetation on the summits of the high mountains\r\nof Costa Rica is of a marked subalpine character, having a great\r\nnumber of northern genera, as _Vaccinium_, _Pernettya_, _Alchemilla_,\r\n_Cardamine_, _Calceolaria_, _Spiræa_, etc.\r\n\r\nCertain types of vegetation are often more due to the sterile nature\r\nof the soil than to elevation.\r\n\r\nAlthough a northern flora is frequent on the high terraces of San\r\nJosé and Cartago, that character is not general because of the\r\nintroduction of cultivated tropical and other plants peculiar to\r\nCosta Rica.\r\n\r\nOn the southern high mountains two species of _Podocarpus_ (_P.\r\ntaxifolia_ and _P. salicifolia_), one of _Alnus_ (_Alnus Mirbelii\r\nSpach._) and one of _Weinmannia_ occur quite generally among the\r\noak forests. Other distinct floral groups are represented by the\r\nvegetation along roads and fences, on potreros, in cultivated regions\r\nand along river shores. The latter especially are rich in herbaceous\r\nplants, grasses, bushes and woods of _Bignoniaceæ_, _Myrtaceæ_,\r\n_Euphorbiaceæ_, _Mimoseæ_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe potreros are characterized by _Tagetes_, _Sida_, _Hyptis,\r\nolanum_, _Salvia_, _Mimosa pudica_ and _M. sensitiva_, etc. Along\r\nfences there grow nearly everywhere _Erythrina corallodendron_,\r\n_Yucca aloifolia_, _Bromelia pinguin_, _Agave americana_, _Cereus_,\r\n_Spondias_, _Bursera_, _Cestrum_, etc.\r\n\r\nProminent characteristic plants, besides the already mentioned\r\nspecies and genera, are the _Piperaceæ_ and _Melastomaceæ_; further,\r\nspecies of _Iriartea_, _Bactris_ and _Raphia_ of the palm order,\r\nand _Alsophylla_, _Schizæa occidentalis_ and _Pteris aquilina_\r\nof the ferns; still further _Castilloa costaricana_, _Gunnera\r\ninsignis_, _Ochroma lagopus_, _Gliciridia_, _Inga edulis_, _Chusquea\r\nmaurofernandeziana_, _Erythrina corallodendron_, _Drymis Winterii\r\nForst._, _Acacia Farnesiana_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe passage from one flora to another is one of insensible\r\ngradations. Cultivated lands, as already stated, do not show any\r\nlonger the original vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe plants which are now mostly cultivated are: _Coffea arabica_\r\n(coffee), _Saccharum officinarum_ (sugar cane), _Zea mays_ (corn),\r\n_Musa paradisiaca_ and _Musa sapientium_ (bananas), _Phaseolus_\r\n(beans), _Oryza sativa_ (rice), _Solanum tuberosum_ (potato),\r\n_Nicotiana tabacum_ (tobacco), _Batatas dulcis_ (sweet potato),\r\n_Lycopersicum esculentum_ and _Lycopersicum Humboldtii_ (tomatoes),\r\n_Capsicum annuum_ (chile), _Ananas sativa_ (pine-apple), _Carica\r\npapaya_ (papaya), _Persea gratissima_ (aguacate), _Anona cherimolia_\r\n(cherimoya), _Manihot aipi_ and _Manihot utilissima_ (yucca or\r\nmandioca), _Indigofera anil_ (indigo), _Gossypium barbadense_\r\n(cotton), _Cichorium Intyous_ (chicory), _Asparagus officinalis_\r\n(asparagus), _Psidium guava_ (guayaba), _Mammea americana_ (mamey),\r\n_Theobroma cacao_ (cacao), etc.\r\n\r\nBefore giving the lists of the woods, tannings, dyeings, gums,\r\nbalsams, resins, rubber, waxes, textile and medicinal plants, oils\r\nand oil seeds, etc., of Costa Rica, it is advantageous to research\r\nto name those collectors and scientists who, having traveled\r\nthrough Costa Rica or established themselves there, have especially\r\ncontributed to the knowledge of the natural resources of the country.\r\nThey are Professor H.

twenty-one species of mammalia, of which ten are domesticated and\r\nfour of _Mus_ introduced, leaving 107 as indigenous to Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThere are only a few species peculiar to Costa Rica, and also but\r\na small number peculiar to Central America, among which are the\r\n_Tapirus dowi alston_ and three species of monkeys. About one-fifth\r\nof the total number also belong to South America and one-seventh\r\nto North America. The rest are found as well in North as in South\r\nAmerica. With respect to the avifauna, there are 725 known species.\r\nThis great variety of the avifauna is due to especial climatic\r\nconditions, to the very rich flora, to the geographical position\r\nbetween two oceans and to the vicinity of so many islands of the\r\nCaribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of 67 Neoarctic species, which are also found in the\r\nnorth of Mexico; of 247 Neotropical or South American species, of\r\n260 autochthonous or exclusively Central American species, and 128\r\nnewly described species which live as well in the northern as in the\r\nsouthern continent. The rest, comprising 23 species, have a doubtful\r\norigin. The best singing birds are the Gilguero, Yigüerro, Toledo,\r\nMozotillo, Cacique, Mongita, Comemaiz, Setillero and Agüillo.\r\n\r\nThere are over 130 species of _Reptilia_ and _Batrachia_ in Costa\r\nRica. Those known and described are 36 _Batrachia_, 28 _Lacertilia_,\r\n60 _Ophidia_ and 6 _Testudinata_. Poisonous snakes are the Toboba,\r\nBocaracá, Oropel, Terciopelo and Cascabel.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica is also very rich in _Fishes_. Those in the Pacific are\r\nalmost entirely different from those of the Atlantic Ocean. Also its\r\ntributary waters have more varied species than those of the Atlantic\r\nslope.\r\n\r\nIn correspondence with the varied topographical, climatological, and\r\nbotanical conditions of Costa Rica is also the _invertebrate fauna_.\r\nAnd here the National Museum, under Mr. Anastasio Alfaro, and the\r\n“Instituto fisico geografico Nacional.” under Professor H. Pittier,\r\nare doing equally excellent work in bringing them to our knowledge,\r\nas they have done like service in other branches of Natural History.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting species of the fauna in Costa Rica among the\r\nmammalia are the monkeys (_Mycetes palliatus_, _Ateles geoffroyi_,\r\nand _Cebus hypoleucus_), the tigre (_Felis onca_), marrigordo\r\n(_Felis pardalis_), puma (_Felis concolor_), the coyote (_Canis\r\nlatrans_), tigrillo (_Urocyon cinereo_), pisote (_Nasua narica_),\r\nmartilla (_Cercoleptes caudivolvulus_), comadreja (_Mustela\r\nbrasiliensis_), chulomuco or tolumuco (_Galictis barbara_), Zorro\r\nhediondo (_Conepatus mapurito_), nutria or perro de agua (_Lutra\r\nfelina_), manati or vaca marina (_Trichecus australis_), danta\r\n(_Elasmognathus bairdii_ and _E. Dowi_), salimo (_Dicotyles tajacú_)\r\ncari blanco (_Dicotyles labiatus_), venado (_Dorcelophus clavatus_),\r\ncabro de monte (_Mazama temama_), ardillas (_Sciurus hypopyrrhus_,\r\n_Sc. æstuans hoffmanni_, _Sc.

Many of their words\r\nare now in common use and incorporated into the Spanish spoken\r\nthere. Notably such words occur in the names of plants, animals and\r\ngeographical localities.\r\n\r\nIn 1569 the Adelantado Peráfan de Rivera made an elaborate detailed\r\nenumeration of the Indians and found their total number to be 25,000.\r\n\r\nMr. M. de Peralta says the Nahuas (Aztecs) and Mangues (Chorotegas),\r\nGüetares, Viceitas, Térrabas, Changuenes, Guaymies, Quepos, Cotos and\r\nBorucas were the principal people who occupied the territory of Costa\r\nRica at the time of the conquest. The Nahuas came from the north,\r\nand if the Mangues did not go from Chiapas, it is necessary to infer\r\nthat from the Gulf of Nicoya and the shores of the lakes of Nicaragua\r\nand Managua they extended to the south of Mexico, where, up to a few\r\nyears ago, their language was spoken at Acalá.\r\n\r\nThe Mangues, or Chorotegas, at the time of the Mexican invasion,\r\noccupied the peninsula of Nicoya and all the lands surrounding the\r\ngulf of that name. They were then, no doubt, the most powerful and\r\nadvanced people in Costa Rica, and carried some of their arts, such\r\nas pottery, sculpture, weaving, and tilling the ground, to greater\r\nperfection than any people occupying the region between their\r\nterritory and that of the Chibcas on the table-land of Colombia.\r\nIn their graves are found gold ornaments and specimens of the\r\nceramic art showing taste in design superior to any that the present\r\ncivilized Costa Rican Indian can manufacture. These graves also\r\ncontain beautiful specimens of obsidian, greenstone and even finely\r\nwrought jade tools and jade ornaments, knives, axes, arrowheads,\r\namulets, rings and a multitude of stone idols, seats, etc. The\r\nMangues appear to have manufactured gold extensively into jewelry.\r\n\r\nThe Güetares made their homes on the slopes of the Turialba. Irazú\r\nand Barba to the southeast of the Mexicans and Chorotegas, and, in a\r\nless degree, they shared in the skill and advancement of the latter,\r\nbut their pottery was inferior in artistic method and quality of\r\nmaterial and workmanship, judging from collections in the National\r\nMuseum of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nPeralta says, “The Nahuas and Mangues of the regions of Nicoya have\r\ncompletely disappeared, although the first still survive in Mexico,\r\nand the latter are represented here and there by a descendant in\r\nMasava (Nicaragua) and in Acalá (Chiapas).” The Nahuas (Aztecs)\r\nleft notable monuments of their material civilization and of their\r\nscientific attainments, and a language that served as the instrument\r\nof a cultivated and thoughtful race.\r\n\r\nDuring the colonial period the Spaniards, in several efforts to\r\nexplore the River Frio, were driven back by the Guatuso Indians, who\r\nstill occupy the greater part of its valley and the slopes of the\r\nvolcanic mountains. It was not until 1856 that a small expedition\r\npenetrated across the country to the Rio Frio from the mouth of the\r\nRiver Arenal, a branch of the San Carlos. They reported fertile,\r\nhilly slopes in its upper reaches, and beautiful plains for most of\r\nthe distance traversed to its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe rubber collectors of Nicaragua for many years have ascended the\r\nRio Frio and other rivers in canoes and plundered the settlements,\r\nplantations and property of the Indians, forcing them to retire\r\nfurther up the river. The Guatusos live in _palenques_ (stockades),\r\nand their houses are similar to the maloccas among Amazon tribes.\r\nEach palenque shelters several families, who cook their food at\r\nseparate fires built on the ground. They live principally on\r\nplantains, yucca, maize, sugar cane, cacao, game and fish, the latter\r\nbeing abundant in the Rio Frio. They also cultivate and smoke tobacco.\r\n\r\nTheir weapons are bows, arrows, stone axes, and wooden knives. They\r\ndrink _chicha_, made by fermenting roasted green plantains, and also\r\n_chicha mascada de maiz_. As the bishop of Costa Rica, Dr. Bernardo\r\nA. Thiel, a very noted ethnologist and archæologist, says:\r\n\r\n“The Guatuso country is probably one of the most delightful portions\r\nof Costa Rica. Every tropical product can be grown there in\r\nabundance, for the lands are immeasurably rich and the climate one of\r\nthe best in the tropical belt.”\r\n\r\nThe last census of the Guatuso Indians is as follows:\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+-----+-------+----------+-------+--------\r\n           Palenques.         | Men.| Women.| Children.| Total.| Graves.\r\n  ----------------------------+-----+-------+----------+-------+--------\r\n    _On the river Tojifo_:    |     |       |          |       |\r\n  Tojifo                      |  26 |   12  |      9   |   47  |    25\r\n  Margarita                   |  24 |   13  |     17   |   54  |    60\r\n  Pedro Joaquin               |  15 |   11  |     13   |   39  |   101\r\n  Sabara                      |   8 |    5  |      7   |   20  |    18\r\n  Culolo                      |   9 |    8  |      4   |   21  |    23\r\n  Napoleon                    |   8 |    5  |      3   |   16  |    36\r\n                              |     |       |          |       |\r\n    _On the river Cucaracha_: |     |       |          |       |\r\n  Juana                       |   8 |    5  |      4   |   17  |    26\r\n                              |     |       |          |       |\r\n    _On the river La Muerte_: |     |       |          |       |\r\n  Congo                       |  10 |    3  |      3   |   16  |     9\r\n  La Muerte                   |   8 |    3  |      1   |   12  |    --\r\n                              |     |       |          |       |\r\n    _On the river Pataste_:   |     |       |          |       |\r\n  San Juan                    |   5 |    1  |      1   |    8  |    --\r\n  Grecia                      |  11 |    4  |      2   |   17  |    --\r\n  ----------------------------+-----+-------+----------+-------+--------\r\n     Total                    | 132 |   70  |     64   |  266  |   298\r\n  ----------------------------+-----+-------+----------+-------+--------\r\n\r\nOf the Talamanca Indians, Professor H. Pittier distinguishes two\r\ntribes, the Brilio and Cabécar. The first live in the valleys and\r\nmountains of Urén and Arari and along the lower course of the Coen\r\nRiver, while the Cabécars dwell in the upper parts of the Coen. Other\r\nIndians, probably of the Tiribi tribe, live in the upper part of the\r\nTeliri valley.\r\n\r\nThe Talamanca Indians have a higher grade of civilization than the\r\nneighboring Boruca or Brunca and Térraba Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Bribris have good traditions and numerous legends of their past.\r\n\r\nThe census of the Talamanca Indians is as follows:\r\n\r\n  -----------+------+--------+-------+---------\r\n             | Male.| Female.| Total.| Married.\r\n  -----------+------+--------+-------+---------\r\n  Lari       |  263 |   269  |   532 |\r\n  Coen       |  172 |   176  |   348 |    --\r\n  Teliri     |   67 |    71  |   138 |     2\r\n  Urén       |  424 |   393  |   817 |    44\r\n  -----------+------+--------+-------+---------\r\n      Total  |  926 |   909  |  1835 |    50\r\n  -----------+------+--------+-------+---------\r\n\r\nThe Térrabas and Bruncas or Boruca Indians are located on the Pacific\r\nslope of the Talamanca mountains, and especially in the great valley\r\nof the Diquis or Rio Grande de Térraba, although there are also a few\r\nIndian palenques in the neighborhood of the Chirripo. The Borucas\r\nor Bruncas are dolichocephalic. The men are large, the women short\r\nand plump. They are more intelligent and active than the Tishbi of\r\nTérraba. Professor Pittier counted in the Boruca valley and at Palma,\r\nPunta Mala and La Uvita 65 to 75 ranchos scattered around, with about\r\n389 inhabitants, while he found 50 to 60 ranchos with about 250\r\ninhabitants in the town of Térraba and 25 to 30 ranchos with about\r\n300 inhabitants in the town of Buenos Aires. There are also some\r\nIndians near the Golfo Dulce.\r\n\r\nTaken in all, about 4000 uncivilized Indians are estimated to remain\r\nin Costa Rica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nPOPULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population of Costa Rica is nearly all white and mostly\r\ndescendants of Spaniards from Galicia. The Indians are not numerous\r\nand are completely distinct from the civilized race. The Negroes and\r\nmixed breeds live almost exclusively on the coast-lands.\r\n\r\nThe Costa Ricans are a well formed, robust and healthy people\r\nwith regular features. The women are gracious, have splendid eyes\r\nand abundance of hair, and appear affable in manner. The men are\r\nintelligent, industrious, economical, honest and peaceable, as well\r\nas polite, truthful and generous. They respect order and property,\r\nlove to work, and are proud of their wealth and of the independence\r\nof their nation.\r\n\r\nEvery Costa Rican owns property of some kind. The better class of\r\nwomen follow in their dress the fashions of Europe; the lower classes\r\nhave gowns of muslin or calico, and wear petticoats, rebozos and very\r\noften panama hats. Some adorn themselves with earrings and other\r\njewelry and some wear shoes.\r\n\r\nThe men dress in European style. The lower class, consisting of\r\nhard-working farmers, owners of small coffee plantations and ox-carts\r\nand oxen for internal traffic, wear coarse cloth coats, drill or\r\ncotton trousers, and straw or felt hats. Most of these people go\r\nbarefooted.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the wealthy have all modern conveniences. Those of\r\nthe poorer classes are nearly comfortless. They are mostly low and\r\nbuilt of adobes, with a roof of tiles, and are arranged in regular\r\nstreets crossing each other at right angles. The public buildings are\r\nspacious and ornamental.\r\n\r\nAmong the principal buildings in San José are the New National\r\nTheatre, in which about 1,000,000 pesos were invested; the National\r\nPalace; the Palace of Justice; the Executive Mansion; the Episcopal\r\nPalace; the National Distillery; the Market; the University; the High\r\nSchool for Young Ladies; the High School for Young Men; the Custom\r\nHouse; the Mint, etc.\r\n\r\nThe city possesses charitable institutions, such as hospitals,\r\norphan asylums, insane asylums, etc., all under the management\r\nof corporations and associations constantly laboring for their\r\nimprovement. The cemeteries are under the supervision of charitable\r\nassociations. There are several parks, a Museum, a Public Library\r\nand scientific, legal, medical, literary and musical societies, an\r\nInternational Club and a German Club, etc.\r\n\r\nThe streets are mostly macadamized or paved with stones and lighted\r\nby electricity. Nearly every city is well-supplied with water\r\nconducted through pipes.\r\n\r\nThe food of the poor comprises meat, beans, corn, rice, tortillas and\r\nplantains.\r\n\r\nSaturday is the especial market day of the cities, and from sunrise\r\ntill noon the market-places are crowded with sellers and buyers.\r\nHere can be found all kind of vegetables and fruits, potatoes, corn,\r\nbeans, coffee, tobacco, sugar, cheese, meat and other food, besides\r\nearthenware, hammocks, hats, rebozos, charcoal, etc.\r\n\r\nThe population of Costa Rica in 1897 was calculated to be 288,769, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  90,940 inhabitants in the Province of San José.\r\n  67,972      ”         ”       ”       Alajuela.\r\n  45,161      ”         ”       ”       Cartago.\r\n  37,603      ”

delinquencies punished by the police courts, namely:\r\n1,295 in San José, 626 in Alajuela, 678 in Cartago, 520 in Heredia,\r\n200 in Liberia, 424 in Puntarenas and 279 in Port Limon. Of these\r\nthere were convictions of\r\n\r\n  1686 for drunkenness and disorder.\r\n   861 for slight misdemeanors.\r\n   340 for fighting, domestic scandals and inflicting slight injuries.\r\n   274 for violations of sanitary and moral ordinances.\r\n   280 for vagrancy.\r\n    80 for carrying arms.\r\n    65 for petty larceny.\r\n     6 for larceny.\r\n\r\nThere were also 989 criminal sentences recorded in the Court of\r\nSecond Instance, together with 124 criminal and civil judgments in\r\nthe Court of Cassation.\r\n\r\nThe national “Presidio de San Lucas” contained at the same time 170\r\nprisoners. Costa Rica in 1896 had 1744 prostitutes, mostly between\r\nsixteen and twenty-five years of age, under supervision. Nearly\r\nhalf of this number were in San José, the rest in the ports and in\r\nHeredia, Alajuela and Cartago. Nearly 300 women were in the hospitals\r\nbeing treated for venereal diseases, while 502 individuals were\r\nregistered in the “Department de profilaxis venerea.”\r\n\r\nThere were during the same year thirteen commercial insolvencies, two\r\ncases of absolute and three of partial divorce.\r\n\r\nThe different courts of the country, during the year of 1896, entered\r\n5417 civil and testamentary judgments, including a number concerning\r\nmining and national land claims.\r\n\r\nThe people of Costa Rica must be considered as standing high\r\nabove those of the neighboring countries in regard to morals and\r\ncivilization. The mass of the people is industrious, honest, sober,\r\nclean, comparatively well-clothed, economical, obedient to the\r\nauthorities and respectful of the laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATION AND COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmigration to Costa Rica has been small. During the first half of\r\n1897 there entered 1533 individuals by Port Limon and 389 by the Port\r\nof Puntarenas; but during the same time 1150 persons left Costa Rica\r\nthrough Port Limon and 344 through Puntarenas. The result is a gain\r\nof only 428 persons in favor of the country. In 1896, the excess of\r\nregistered immigrants over emigrants was 1112 persons, there having\r\nentered 3980 and departed 2868 persons. Several times attempts have\r\nunsuccessfully been made by foreigners to establish colonies.\r\n\r\nStill there is a colony in the Department of Guanacaste, called\r\n“Colonia de Nicoya,” which was commenced by Cubans, headed by Maceo,\r\nthe late Cuban revolutionist chief. This colony possesses a sugar\r\nfactory and five trapiches, producing 720 quintals of sugar and about\r\n3000 quintals of mascabado. Only five colonists still cultivate\r\ntobacco. The colony has a school for boys and another for girls, the\r\nlatter attended by thirty and the other by forty pupils. Besides\r\nthere is here postal service and a telegraph office.\r\n\r\nA second colony located in the San Carlos district is known as\r\n“Colonia de Aguas Zarcas,” and has 500 lots, but it does not progress\r\nfor lack of roads and markets easy to reach.\r\n\r\nA third colony was established in Santa Clara, on a branch of the\r\nAtlantic Railroad. But there are actually there only eight families\r\nwith about seventy hectares of cultivated land, one trapiche and a\r\nsaw-mill.\r\n\r\nAnother colony was started by the River Plate Trust, Loan and Agency\r\nCompany, Limited, in Turialba, near the railroad between Limon and\r\nSan José. There were 500 acres sold for 15 pesos each, 2071.9 acres\r\nfor 20 pesos each, 750 acres for 25 pesos each, and 1381.1 acres for\r\n30 pesos each, the land being situated on the Tuis River and Cabeza\r\nde Buey. Besides a contract was made with W. C. Beal from Portland,\r\nOregon, U. S. A., for the sale of 14,000 acres on condition of\r\nprocuring each year for seven years the settlement of a number of\r\nfamilies to cultivate these lands. In order to give easy access to\r\nthe markets, a cart-road is in process of construction, which will\r\nconnect the colony with the nearest railroad station.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Costa Rica is now preparing new laws in regard to\r\nimmigration, colonization and sale of national lands. The former laws\r\nhave been suspended, the Government being convinced that the lands\r\nappropriated in former years are more than sufficient to respond to\r\nthe requirements of the next twenty years. The Government also thinks\r\nit to be preferable to promote by restrictive laws the subdivision\r\nof these lands and their cultivation than to consent to new grants\r\nunder the former statutes. Exceptions are to be made for colonization\r\ncompanies and enterprises adapted to the economic development of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn former years the Government of Costa Rica has often offered\r\ninducements in the way of land-grants for European immigration. In\r\n1849 a grant of land of twenty leagues in length by twelve in breadth\r\nwas made to a French company for 1000 colonists. The conditions of\r\nthe contract were not carried out, though a considerable number of\r\nimmigrants formed under it an establishment. A similar grant was made\r\non the Atlantic coast to a British company, which had no result.\r\n\r\nStill another concession was made, May 7, 1852, to a German company\r\norganized at Berlin with Baron von Bülow as Director. This enterprise\r\ndied with its manager in 1856.\r\n\r\nA further attempt was made in 1852, by Crisanto Medina, to whom\r\na large grant of land was made for colonization purposes at\r\nMiravalles, about 2500 feet above the sea, but this project too was\r\nabandoned after settling about thirty-seven Germans on the grant. In\r\n1856, some French immigrants came, and in 1858 another colonization\r\nlaw was passed, and ever since the Government has persisted in the\r\npolicy of augmenting the population by offering inducements to\r\nforeigners to settle in Costa Rica. All these Government proffers\r\nhave, however, proved ineffectual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nElementary instruction of both sexes is compulsory and at the expense\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\nThe following data are obtained from the Minister of Public\r\nInstruction, Licentiate Ricardo Pacheco. In 1896 Costa Rica had 327\r\nprimary schools with 21,913 enrolled pupils, or 53 per cent. of all\r\nthe children of school age, as can be seen in the following table:\r\n\r\n        (Part 1 of 2)\r\n  -----------+-----------------+-----------------------+\r\n             |   NUMBER OF     |    NUMBER OF PUPILS.  |\r\n             | OFFICIAL SCHOOLS|                       |\r\n             +----+----+---+---+-------+-------+-------+\r\n             |    |  G | M | T |       |   G   |   T   |\r\n             |  B |  i | i | o |   B   |   i   |   o   |\r\n             |  o |  r | x | t |   o   |   r   |   t   |\r\n             |  y |  l | e | a |   y   |   l   |   a   |\r\n             |  s |  s | d | l |   s   |   s   |   l   |\r\n             |  . |  . | . | . |   .   |   .   |   .   |\r\n  -----------+----+----+---+---+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  San José   |  43|  43|  6| 92|  3,766|  3,766|  7,118|\r\n  Alajuela   |  46|  45| 16|107|  3,028|  2,862|  5,890|\r\n  Cartago    |  25|  24|  1| 50|  1,817|  1,475|  3,292|\r\n  Heredia    |  20|  20|  7| 47|  2,132|  1,728|  3,880|\r\n  Guanacaste |  11|   9|  1| 21|    649|    513|  1,162|\r\n  Puntarenas |   5|   4| --|  9|    297|    199|    496|\r\n  Limon      |  --|  --|  1|  1|     30|     45|     75|\r\n  -----------+----+----+---+---+-------+-------+-------+\r\n             | 150| 145| 32|327| 11,719| 10,194| 21,913|\r\n  -----------+----+----+---+---+-------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\n        (Part 2 of 2)\r\n  -----------+-------------------------------------\r\n             |         NUMBER OF PUPILS.\r\n             |\r\n             +-------+--------+---------+----------\r\n             |       |        |         |\r\n             |       |        |         | For each\r\n             |  Per  |  Per   | Per 100 |   100\r\n             |school.|teacher.|  Inhab- | children\r\n             |       |        | itants. | of school\r\n             |       |        |         |   age.\r\n  -----------+-------+--------+---------+----------\r\n  San José   | 78.45 |  28.81 |   9.27  |  54.57\r\n  Alajuela   | 55.04 |  32.36 |  10.29  |  60.57\r\n  Cartago    | 65.84 |  24.75 |   8.66  |  51.07\r\n  Heredia    | 82.56 |  26.76 |  12.27  |  72.19\r\n  Guanacaste | 55.33 |  21.92 |   5.79  |  34.09\r\n  Puntarenas | 55.11 |  22.59 |   4.07  |  23.98\r\n  Limon      | 75.00 |  37.50 |   1.00  |  58.96\r\n  -----------+-------+--------+---------+----------\r\n             | 67.01 |  27.94 |   9.01  |  53.\r\n  -----------+-------+--------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nThis great number shows a marked predisposition of the people in\r\nfavor of education. It is also a fact that Costa Rica holds the first\r\nplace of all Latin American nations in regard to public instruction.\r\n\r\nThe number of school buildings is 215, besides 29 in process of\r\nconstruction and 50 projected. These 215 buildings are the property\r\nof the “Juntas de Educacion.” Besides these, 107 buildings are rented\r\nand 6 loaned. There are\r\n\r\n   92 schools in  48 different localities in the Department of San José.\r\n  107   ”         67          ”             ”         ”        Alajuela.\r\n   50   ”         27          ”             ”         ”        Cartago.\r\n   47   ”         29          ”             ”         ”        Heredia.\r\n   21   ”         22          ”             ”         ”        Guanacaste.\r\n    9   ”          8          ”             ”         ”        Puntarenas.\r\n    1   ”          1          ”             ”         ”        Limon.\r\n  ---             --\r\n  327 schools in 202 different localities.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica has more teachers than soldiers.

Further, the\r\nGovernment of Chile allows six Costa Ricans to study at its expense\r\nin the pedagogical Institute of Santiago.\r\n\r\nAnother very important national institution is the “Instituto\r\nfisico-geográfico,” under the direction of the very competent\r\nProfessor H. Pittier, with three sections; a geographical section for\r\ntopographical study and a construction of maps, also a meteorological\r\nand a botanical section. Their excellent publications have proved the\r\ngreat usefulness of this institution, and it is to be wished that\r\nits able and learned director will get adequate aid to carry out his\r\npromising studies of the physical features of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nAnother useful institution is the “National Museum,” under the\r\nintelligent direction of a young Costa Rican scientist. Mr. Anastasio\r\nAlfaro. It has an interesting section of archæology and ethnography,\r\nand a section of zoology, already rich in cabinets, to which is\r\nattached a small zoological garden.\r\n\r\nA third useful institution is the “National Library” with 10,242\r\ncatalogued books and about 5,000 more ready to be registered and\r\nincorporated.\r\n\r\nThe first steps towards the organization of educational institutions\r\nwere taken in 1824, under the administration of Don Juan Mora\r\nFernandez. Then public instruction was declared an obligatory duty\r\nof the State. The institution, which afterward became the University\r\nof Santo Tomas, was founded in 1844, at the instigation of Dr.\r\nCastilo. The efforts of Costa Rica to advance education have been\r\ngreat and sustained, and it is to be remarked that those in office\r\nhave constantly shown laudable interest in the matter. In 1869 the\r\nNormal School was opened and a system adopted in harmony with modern\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nAs related to the subject of public education, the following list\r\nenumerates the names of the principal daily and weekly papers,\r\nperiodicals and annual publications:\r\n\r\nThe principal _newspapers_ are:\r\n\r\n  _Dailies:_\r\n\r\n  La Gaceta oficial,\r\n  Diario de Costa Rica,\r\n  La República,\r\n  El Heraldo,\r\n  El Fígaro,\r\n  La Prensa libre,\r\n  El Diarito,\r\n  El Imparcial,\r\n  El Pabellon Liberal,\r\n  La Union Católica.\r\n\r\n  _Weekly publications_ are:\r\n\r\n  La Abeja médica,\r\n  Boletin de las Escuelas Primarias,\r\n  La Gaceta médica,\r\n  El Latiguillo,\r\n  El Sancho Panzo,\r\n  El Bocaccio,\r\n  La Voz del Pueblo.\r\n\r\n  _Annual publications_ are:\r\n\r\n  Anales del Museo Nacional,\r\n  Anales del Instituto fisico-geográfico,\r\n  Anuario estadístico,\r\n  Anuario de la Inspeccion general de enseñanza,\r\n  Memorias de los Ministerios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION, POST AND TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Port Limon_ on the Atlantic and _Puntarenas_ on the Pacific Ocean\r\nare first in importance among the means of communication of Costa\r\nRica.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 there entered the Port of Limon 294 vessels (271 steamers, 20\r\nbarks and 3 goletas), with a tonnage of 348,355 tons. Of these, 16\r\nvessels bore the national flag, 142 the English, 12 the French, 26\r\nthe German, 27 the Swedish-Norwegian, 47 that of the United States,\r\n11 the Nicaraguan, and 3 the Colombian flag.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year there entered the Port of Puntarenas 158 vessels\r\n(125 steamers, 24 barks, 5 paileboats 4 launches), having a tonnage\r\nof 155,869 tons. Of these, 14 carried the national flag, 34 the\r\nEnglish, 1 the Italian, 23 the German, 3 the Swedish-Norwegian, 4 the\r\nDanish, 74 that of the United States, and 5 the Colombian flag.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 there entered the Port of Limon 311 vessels, with a tonnage\r\nof 281,361, while in the Port of Puntarenas there entered 147\r\nvessels, with a tonnage of 146,313.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 there entered the Port of Limon 258 steamers and 41 sailing\r\nvessels, while 152 vessels entered Puntarenas, of which 73 were\r\nsteamers of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, 28 steamers of an\r\nEnglish cattle transporting company, 8 German steamers of the Cosmos\r\nand Kirsten lines, 9 Colombian paileboats, 16 German barks, 11\r\nNorwegian barks, 3 English barks, 2 Italian barks, and 1 French bark.\r\n\r\nThe agents of the different steamship lines in the capital, San José,\r\nare, for the Port of _Limon_: Mr. Juan Knöhr for the Hamburg American\r\nSteamship Company; Mr. John M. Keith for the Atlas Line; Mr. I. R.\r\nSasso for the Italian Line, La Veloce; Messrs. Lyon & Co. for the\r\nRoyal Mail Line; Messrs. W. J. Field & Co. for the Prince Line; Mr.\r\nMinor C. Keith for the Spanish Transatlantic Line; Messrs. Alvarado\r\n& Co. for the French Transatlantic Line; Mr. Minor C. Keith for the\r\nNew Orleans lines; while Messrs. Rohrmoser & Co. are the agents for\r\nthe Port of Puntarenas of the Hamburg Pacific Steamship Company, the\r\nKosmos Line and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.\r\n\r\nThere are two important railroads, the Atlantic and the Pacific\r\nRailroads. The Atlantic Railroad goes from the Port of Limon westerly\r\nto Alajuela, a distance of 190 kilometers. The stations on the line\r\nare Limon, Moin, S. Mouth, Matina, Siquirres, La Junta, Pascua,\r\nTorito, Turialba, Las Pavas, Tucurique, Juan Viñas, Santiago,\r\nParaiso, Cartago, Tres Rios, Curridabat, San Pedro, San José, San\r\nJuan, Santo Domingo, Heredia, San Joaquin, Rio Segundo, Alajuela.\r\n\r\nA branch of this road starts from La Junta, a point about thirty-four\r\nkilometers west of Port Limon, and runs first northward and then\r\nwestward until it reaches Guapiles, a recently founded colony on the\r\nplains of Santa Clara. It was originally intended to lay the track to\r\nCarrillo and through the La Palma Pass to San José, but this plan has\r\nnot been carried out.\r\n\r\nAnother branch goes from Port Limon to the Banana River, a distance\r\nof about five kilometers.\r\n\r\nThe gross earnings of this road were:\r\n\r\n  In 1891-1892              1,409,598 pesos.\r\n   ” 1892-1893              1,973,936   ”\r\n   ” 1893-1894              2,250,979   ”\r\n   ” 1894-1895              2,446,701   ”\r\n   ” Second half of 1895      892,932   ”\r\n   ” 1896                   2,618,113   ”\r\n\r\nThe net earnings were as follows:\r\n\r\n  In 1891-1892                   362,066 pesos.\r\n   ” 1892-1893                   697,479   ”\r\n   ” 1893-1894                   674,452   ”\r\n   ” 1894-1895                 1,030,160   ”\r\n   ” Second half of 1895         677,986   ”\r\n   ” 1896                      1,114,290   ”\r\n\r\nIt moved during the fiscal year of 1896:\r\n\r\n  574,723       passengers.\r\n   10,315       tons of goods for export.\r\n   23,245          ”    imported goods.\r\n   34,558          ”    local freight.\r\n   52,335       tons or 1,570,060 bunches of bananas.\r\n    3,801       animals.\r\n\r\nThis road has a number of good station-buildings, and a pier at\r\nPort Limon with all facilities for the quick handling of freight,\r\nespecially of bananas. The freight rates are relatively very high.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Railroad, about fourteen miles (or twenty-two kilometers)\r\nin length, belongs to the Government, and runs from Puntarenas east\r\nto Esparta, about seven hundred feet above the sea. It received\r\nin 1896, 18,486.60 pesos from freights and 19,392.80 pesos from\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nDuring the same time the Government expended 24,288.31 pesos in\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nAnother railroad, on Government account, is under construction to\r\nconnect San José with the Pacific coast, and a million pesos are\r\nannually set aside for the work. It is to be about ninety kilometers\r\nlong and to run most of the way through the valley of the Rio Grande.\r\nThe western end for about twenty-four kilometers will cross a roughly\r\nbroken country in order to reach the roadstead of Tívives.\r\n\r\nAn important line of railway is projected to run from Jimenez, on the\r\nGuapiles branch of the Costa Rica Railway, fifty-six miles from Port\r\nLimon, to the mouth of the Rio Frio, near its entrance into the Lake\r\nof Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nIt is to cross the River San Carlos near El Muelle, from which\r\npoint it is proposed to extend the line through a low pass of the\r\nMiravalles mountains, about two thousand feet above sea-level,\r\nto Culebra Bay on the Pacific. Such a railway would contribute\r\nenormously to the development of northern Costa Rica. The region\r\ntraversed by the line is highly fertile. A connection of the Costa\r\nRica Railway with Lake Nicaragua would also give to the State of\r\nNicaragua a much needed convenient access to the Atlantic Ocean for\r\nnearly its entire trade.\r\n\r\nAnother important project President Iglesias contemplates. It is a\r\nship-canal along the coast line from Matina to the Colorado River,\r\nand even on to the mouth of the San Juan, a total distance of over\r\nsixty-five miles. This coast consists of a continuous narrow sand\r\nbank between which and the mainland there is an inlet or arm of the\r\nsea, said to be navigable now for the whole distance.\r\n\r\nThis ship-canal would open an extensive banana region as well as\r\nexcellent lands for the cultivation of cacao and rubber trees and\r\nmany other tropical plants.\r\n\r\nWith respect to other internal communications, there exists a fairly\r\ngood cart-road, opened about sixty years ago, from Cartago _via_\r\nSan José to Puntarenas. Over this road nearly all export and import\r\ntraffic was done until the Atlantic Railroad was opened in 1891.\r\n\r\nAnother cart-road runs across Guanacaste to Nicaragua. Besides these\r\nroads there is a small number of shorter and more local roads, not\r\ncounting a well-paved one, about twenty-five miles long, now partly\r\nabandoned. It goes through the La Palma Pass towards Carrillo, Santa\r\nClara and the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nThere is a tramway in Cartago, connecting the city with its\r\nsuburbs and Aguacaliente. In San José a trolley line is soon to be\r\nestablished. Away from the conveniences now enumerated the people\r\nare wont to ride on horse or mule trails. The Government, however,\r\ntakes care to increase and improve the cart-roads and other means\r\nof communications. During the last fiscal year over one hundred and\r\nninety-four thousand pesos were spent on roads and bridges, and there\r\nis no doubt that Costa Rica, in this respect, too, is far ahead\r\nof the other Central American countries. Most of the Government\r\nexpenditure named was spent on the national cart-road, the roads to\r\nSan Carlos, Puriscal, Tablazo and Sarapiqui and on bridges over the\r\nRio Grande, Reventazon, Bagaces, etc. In each district there is a\r\n“_Junta Itineraria_” for the conservation and improvement of roads,\r\nevery proprietor participating in proportion to his property.\r\n\r\nThe following itinerary of roads and water routes, their distances\r\nand character, is reproduced from Mr. Richard Villafranca’s “Costa\r\nRica:”\r\n\r\n\r\nDistances from San José, the capital of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\n

foreign\r\ncountries by steamers, and four times per month overland to the\r\nneighboring countries. From the port of Limon the mail goes to\r\nEurope, _via_ Hamburg, twice a month, the 12th and 29th; by the Royal\r\nMail on the 9th day of each month; and _via_ Marseilles on the 12th\r\nof each month; to Europe and the United States _via_ New York every\r\nFriday, and to Europe, the United States and Mexico _via_ New Orleans\r\nevery Monday.\r\n\r\nFrom the Port of Puntarenas the mail goes to the West Indies and\r\nSouth America, _via_ Panamá, three times a month, and as often also\r\nto the States of Central America. Overland to Nicaragua the mail is\r\nsent, _via_ Liberia, every Thursday. In the Gulf of Nicoya are three\r\nsteamers in the postal service, namely the “Puntarenas,” “Fernandez”\r\nand “Dr. Castro.” The principal post-offices in Costa Rica are these:\r\n\r\n  Alajuela,\r\n  Aserri,\r\n  Atenas,\r\n  Barba,\r\n  Bagres,\r\n  Ballena,\r\n  Boruca,\r\n  Bebedero,\r\n  Cartago,\r\n  Carrillo,\r\n  Curridabat,\r\n  Desamparados,\r\n  Desmonte,\r\n  Escasú,\r\n  Esparta,\r\n  Guaitil,\r\n  Guadalupe,\r\n  Grecia,\r\n  Heredia,\r\n  Humo,\r\n  Jimenez,\r\n  Juan Viñas,\r\n  Limon,\r\n  Liberia,\r\n  Las Cañas,\r\n  La Union,\r\n  La Cruz,\r\n  Mojon,\r\n  Matina,\r\n  Naranjo,\r\n  Nicoya,\r\n  Old Harbor,\r\n  Pacaca,\r\n  Puriscal,\r\n  Puntarenas,\r\n  Palmares,\r\n  Paraiso,\r\n  Quemadas,\r\n  Reventazon,\r\n  San Isidro,\r\n  Santo Domingo,\r\n  Santa Barbara,\r\n  San Rafael,\r\n  San Antonio,\r\n  San Pedro,\r\n  San Lucas,\r\n  San Marcos,\r\n  Santa Ana,\r\n  San Juan,\r\n  San Vicente,\r\n  San Ramon,\r\n  San Carlos,\r\n  Sardinal,\r\n  Santa Cruz,\r\n  San Bernardo,\r\n  Santa Maria Dota,\r\n  Siquirres,\r\n  San Mateo,\r\n  San Joaquin,\r\n  Térraba.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 there were received from\r\n\r\n                                Pieces.\r\n\r\n  The United States of America  189,966\r\n  Great Britain                  64,763\r\n  Germany                        45,900\r\n  France                         43,276\r\n  Salvador                       37,425\r\n  Spain                          29,966\r\n  Guatemala                      27,000\r\n  Colombia                       20,063\r\n  The Antilles                   13,341\r\n  Honduras                       10,697\r\n  Italy                          11,970\r\n  Nicaragua                       8,835\r\n\r\nDuring the same year there were sent out to\r\n\r\n                                Pieces.\r\n\r\n  The United States of America  45,547\r\n  Guatemala                     25,020\r\n  Spain                         23,230\r\n  Salvador                      20,194\r\n  France                        22,738\r\n  Italy                          8,333\r\n  Great Britain                 20,425\r\n  Germany                       17,559\r\n  Nicaragua                     14,577\r\n  Colombia                      14,577\r\n  The Antilles                  10,148\r\n  Honduras                       9,159\r\n  Argentina                      6,354\r\n\r\nThe entire postal service comprised the movement of 3,494,515 pieces,\r\n23,843 money orders and 6919 parcels.

Experiments have proved that the coffee-tree\r\ncan also be successfully cultivated at a height of 600 meters, and\r\nstill lower down, by moderating the glare of the sun with adequate\r\nshades and by pruning to correct excessive growth and fructification.\r\n\r\n“Coffee was introduced into the country from Havana in 1796 by\r\nFrancisco Javier Navarro, as were also the mango and the cinnamon.\r\nThe first seeds were sown in Cartago. Much credit for the propagation\r\nof coffee culture in Costa Rica is due to Padre Velarde, under\r\nthe government of Don Tomas de Acosta, who took great interest in\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\n“During the administration of Don Juan Rafael Mora (1849-1857)\r\nfarming received a remarkable development, for it was much promoted\r\nby the construction of important roads. The cultivation of coffee\r\nand sugar cane then absorbed the attention of the country to such an\r\nextent that, in 1861, 100,000 quintals were exported.” (J. B. Calvo’s\r\nbook on Costa Rica).\r\n\r\nThe census of 1892 supplies the following figures concerning coffee:\r\n\r\n\r\nProvince of San José.\r\n\r\n

-------------+-------------+----------+----------+----------+-----------\r\n\r\nAltogether Costa Rica, in 1892, had 8366 coffee-fincas with\r\n26,911,078 coffee-trees, and a crop of 378,224 quintals or 17,388,704\r\nkilograms, valued at 10,954,744 pesos.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to learn the amount of the coffee crops since\r\n1883, given in sacks of fifty-nine or sixty kilograms

the banana.\r\nIts cultivation was begun on the Atlantic coast in 1879, and the\r\nfirst 360 bunches were shipped, February 7. 1880, by steamer\r\n“Earnholm” from Port Limon to New York.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 there were 350 farms, comprising over four thousand acres of\r\nland, containing 570,000 banana plants, from which, in that year,\r\n420,000 bunches were obtained. Before 1879 banana plants were set\r\nout in coffee plantations to shade the young trees and shelter their\r\nberries. The bananas were used to feed pigs. The laboring classes\r\nkept a few plants, using the fruit boiled with salt, or roasted on\r\nhot coals instead of bread.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the banana export figures since 1883:\r\n\r\n            Bundles.

The aggregates\r\nwere 14,787 acres, and a production of 1,368,000 pounds of sugar and\r\n18,454,000 pounds of dulce.\r\n\r\nCacao culture has received but little attention in Costa Rica,\r\nbecause the more profitable coffee plantations absorb all the time\r\nand capital. The number of plantations regularly established up to\r\n1888 was 198, having in all 56,426 trees that yielded in the same\r\nyear 331,900 pounds valued at 165,770 pesos. Most of the cacao was\r\ncultivated in Aserri, Atenas, Naranjo, Heredia, Paraiso, Guanacaste\r\nand Limon.\r\n\r\nCacao was exported from 1884 to 1889 as follows:\r\n\r\n  Years.    Pounds.

It was so intelligently cultivated that\r\nthe finer grades were produced. The rise in the price of coffee and\r\nthe competition with the flour of the United States and Chile drove\r\nout the native wheat almost entirely, and to-day the cultivation of\r\nthis grain is badly neglected. To-day the only flour-mill in this\r\ncountry grinds imported wheat.\r\n\r\nTobacco was a monopoly for many years, and only recently has the\r\nculture been taken up by the people.\r\n\r\nOther important agricultural products are rice, beans, corn and\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of rice in Costa Rica demands very little care and no\r\nirrigation to produce two crops a year of a very superior quality.\r\nBeans and corn are successfully grown everywhere in the country,\r\nwhile the raising of potatoes is almost wholly confined to the\r\nhillsides of Cartago and Alajuela, where they acquire an extremely\r\nfine quality.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1892, the average annual production of\r\nthese crops for that and the two preceding years was in liters as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  ----------+-----------+----------+----------+-----------\r\n            |   Corn.   |  Beans.  |   Rice.  | Potatoes.\r\n  ----------+-----------+----------+----------+-----------\r\n  San José  |  8,394,527| 1,842,527|   236,543|     7,915\r\n  Alajuela  |  6,898,549|   999,652|   867,528|       ..\r\n  Cartago   |  7,874,642| 1,724,628|       .. | 1,745,725\r\n  Heredia   |  2,949,692|   132,842|       .. |       ..\r\n  Guanacaste|  1,862,598|    92,321|   121,342|       ..\r\n  Puntarenas|    392,721|    21,325|   132,845|       ..\r\n  Limon     |     18,525|     2,822|       .. |       ..\r\n  ----------+-----------+----------+----------+-----------\r\n     Total  | 28,391,254| 4,816,117| 1,358,258| 1,753,640\r\n  ----------+-----------+----------+----------+-----------\r\n\r\nImportant agricultural districts are, besides the Central Highlands\r\nabout one hundred and fifty kilometers in length by sixty kilometers\r\nin width, the great valleys of Talamanca, Santa Clara, Tortuguero,\r\nSan Carlos and Rio Frio. Along the Pacific the great valley of\r\nTérraba and the plains of Golfo Dulce and Guanacaste are fertile\r\nregions, which, if properly tilled, would offer advantages equal to\r\nthe Central Highlands, where nearly the entire population of Costa\r\nRica is concentrated.\r\n\r\nPlants characterizing fertile lands, rich in humus, on the Atlantic\r\nslope, are _Piper_, especially that with large leaves, _Loaseæ_,\r\nand certain _Acanthaceæ_. On the Pacific side such characteristic\r\nplants are _Piper_, with smaller leaves, the Pacaya Palm, and some\r\nferns. Especially are the _Aspidium_ and _Polypodium_ found in large\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nConsidering the future of Costa Rica, the question of farm labor\r\nis of vital importance. There are only a few Indians, and they are\r\nrapidly decreasing. It looks as though the fertile lowlands on the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific sides, as well as those in the extensive and\r\nfruitful San Juan valley, must be turned over to the Negro race as\r\nthe only one capable of enduring so inhospitable a climate. These\r\nregions are the richest of all and could sustain a large population.\r\n\r\nThe _live stock_ of Costa Rica, though in general superior to that\r\nof the rest of Central America, is not yet sufficiently large to\r\nsupply the local demand. Although there has been recent improvement\r\nin breeding cattle and horses, yet the high grade animals, which\r\ncould be easily introduced into a country of so many natural\r\nadvantages, are still lacking. At different times the development\r\nof this industry has been attempted. Costa Rica has vast pasture\r\nlands splendidly adapted to cattle. It has very nutritious forage\r\nplants, like arrocillo, cola de venado, zacate de guinea, zacate de\r\ncastilla, zacate pará, zacate ancho, grama, guate, caña de azucar,\r\ngamalote, sabanilla, teosinte, lengua de vaca, guácimo, jengibrillo,\r\nplatanillo, etc.\r\n\r\nThe _live stock_ of Costa Rica in 1892 was distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n                   Cattle.      Horses.      Sheep.     Swine.\r\n\r\n  San José          51,884      17,542       1,538      23,628\r\n  Alajuela          62,410      16,774         159      16,185\r\n  Cartago           48,555       9,900         715       5,109\r\n  Heredia           35,391       6,380          57      13,241\r\n  Guanacaste       134,567      24,458         296       2,180\r\n  Puntarenas         9,667       1,721          --       1,128\r\n  Limon              3,191         268          --         857\r\n                   -------      ------       -----      ------\r\n    Total          345,665      77,043       2,765      62,328\r\n\r\nThe consumption of cattle in Costa Rica is exhibited by the following\r\ndata:\r\n\r\n                                                     First half of\r\n                   1894.       1895.        1896.        1897.\r\n\r\n  San José        12,851      12,824       13,467        6,942\r\n  Alajuela         7,402       7,184        7,180        3,493\r\n  Cartago          5,207       4,881        5,297        2,506\r\n  Heredia          4,864       4,942        4,249        2,438\r\n  Guanacaste       2,701       1,990        1,928          882\r\n  Puntarenas       1,472       1,471        1,302          770\r\n  Limon              804         789          798          488\r\n                  ------      ------       ------       ------\r\n    Total         35,301      34,081       34,221       17,519\r\n\r\nFurther official reports disclose that in the capital the consumption\r\nof meat is quite uniform during the entire year, while in the country\r\nit is greater from August to January than from February to July.\r\n\r\nThe total value of the natural, agricultural and live stock products\r\nof the country has been calculated at 19,000,000 pesos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCE AND INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoaquin Bernardo Calvo, in his work on Costa Rica published in 1890,\r\nobserves that “at the beginning of the Colonial Government the Port\r\nof Suerre, on the Atlantic coast, had some commercial importance, but\r\nthat the Port of Rivera on the west coast of the Gulf of Nicoya was\r\ngreater, as were also Coronado del Norte on the Island of Caño and\r\nthe Golfo de Ossa, now Golfo Dulce.\r\n\r\n“All the ships then plying on the Pacific between Mexico, Panama,\r\nPerú and intermediate ports were wont to ride at anchor at the Island\r\nof Caño. The most important centre of commerce in those times was\r\nthe City of Santiago de Talamanca, now extinct, whence cargoes were\r\nsent in three days’ time to Porto Bello. The exports of that age were\r\ncacao, potatoes, honey, wax, sarsaparilla and hemp. When the city was\r\ndestroyed its traffic was dispersed.\r\n\r\n“In 1638 the opening of the Matina road was the beginning of a new\r\nera. The cacao haciendas in the valley of that name acquired a new\r\nimportance. At the same time the Gulf of Nicoya became a centre of\r\ntraffic. Costa Rica was then in a flourishing condition and would\r\nhave prospered finely but for the pirates and Mosquito Indians, who\r\nconstantly menaced its welfare and whose vandalism ravaged the coast\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\n“After that period Costa Rica was reduced to woeful misery, carrying\r\non an insignificant commerce overland with Panama by mules and\r\nsending a few unimportant articles to Nicaragua. Thus more than a\r\ncentury passed.\r\n\r\n“In the present century (1813) the Captaincy General imposed severe\r\nrestrictions on the commerce of the Province. At the time of\r\ndeclaring independence the situation of Costa Rica was wretched.\r\n\r\n“Just beginning an independent career, struggling to inaugurate a\r\nsystem of government wholly new and opposed to the preceding one,\r\ncontending with poverty, in a state of complete upheaval, the work\r\nundertaken by the forefathers of the present Costa Ricans was full of\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n“Coffee culture gave a new impulse and importance to Costa Rica. At\r\nthe close of the first half of the Nineteenth Century commerce was\r\ncarried on with the north through Matina and Sarapiqui, and through\r\nCaldera on the Pacific.\r\n\r\n“The greater facilities available on the Pacific coast, however,\r\nespecially when a line of steamers connecting with the Panama\r\nRailroad opened a new way to the Atlantic, turned the course of\r\nbusiness to Puntarenas, a new port which soon became the sole\r\ncommercial route.\r\n\r\n“This state of things, unnecessarily adding to the expense of\r\nimportations, continued for years. When the Port of Limon was opened\r\nto commerce the competition of two routes and the new facilities of\r\na railroad and a wagon road to the Atlantic greatly promoted traffic\r\nand contributed to the general wealth.”\r\n\r\nIn 1848 seventy vessels entered Puntarenas, having a registration of\r\n7180 tons. In 1884 this number had increased to 113, having 137,368\r\ntons registration, and in the same year there entered Port Limon\r\n121 vessels of 126,875 aggregate tonnage. In 1894 there entered\r\n158 vessels with 155,869 tons at Puntarenas, and 294 vessels with\r\n348,355 tons at Port Limon. The freight in 1858 on coffee to Panama\r\nby steamer alone was five-eighths of a cent per pound. In 1870 the\r\nWest India and Pacific Company’s steamers received as freights from\r\nPuntarenas to Liverpool, £5 10s. 0d. per ton; from Puntarenas to\r\nLondon, £6 2s. 6d. per ton.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 freights from Puntarenas to European ports were £4 per ton,\r\nand from Port Limon £2. To-day the freight rates are cheaper still.\r\n\r\nThe present tariff is in many ways inequitable. It is based on no\r\nprinciple, and, with the exception of some later laws especially\r\nenacted, it does not correspond with the economic condition and\r\ncommerce of the country. Yet on a great number of articles the tariff\r\nis less than in Mexico, Guatemala, Salvador, Peru, Bolivia and\r\nUruguay.\r\n\r\nThe custom-duties are collected on gross weight, and generally amount\r\nto from twenty to twenty-five per cent. on the valuation of imports.\r\nThey are paid one-half down and one-half within three months’ time.\r\nAll goods for Costa Rica have to come accompanied by corresponding\r\nconsular invoices. The principal importations are silk, wool, linen,\r\ncotton, machinery, implements and tools for agriculture and other\r\nindustries, furniture, glassware, tinware, hardware and haberdashery,\r\nornaments, articles of luxury, mercury and perfumery, beer, wines,\r\nliquors, soap, coffee-sacks, flour, sugar, shoes, saddles, harnesses,\r\nbutter, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable of Exports and Imports of Costa Rica Since 1884.\r\n\r\n                 Exportations.

      6,697,326 51\r\n\r\nThe _foreign debt_ contracted in 1871 and 1872, in England, against\r\nthe will of the nation, has been disastrous to it. It amounts to\r\n£2,000,000 in five per cent. debentures. Lately an arrangement was\r\nmade under which the amortization of this debt will begin in 1917,\r\ninstead of 1898, and with £10,000 per year, instead of £20,000. The\r\ngovernment is also authorized to buy in its own bonds for their\r\nimmediate liquidation.\r\n\r\nThe _floating debt_ chiefly consists of private deposits, of the\r\nschool-loan, amortization of which is made annually, of paper money\r\nwhich is received in very limited amounts, and of bills payable,\r\nmostly given for sugar and syrups to the “National Liquor Distillery”\r\nand drawn on thirty days’ sight. The rest of the floating debt\r\nscarcely amounts to 50,000 pesos.\r\n\r\nIn figures the _interior debt_ of Costa Rica may be represented as\r\nfollows: 79,155.75 pesos in notes of war emission; 1,037,628.43 pesos\r\nfor various accounts, private deposits, cash orders, municipal fund,\r\necclesiastical fund, etc., making a total of 1,116,784.18 pesos.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor in the commercial and economic life of Costa\r\nRica is the money in circulation. Including every kind of emission,\r\nnotes of the Costa Rica bank, national paper money, war-emission\r\npaper money, silver and gold coin, the money in circulation amounted\r\nin\r\n\r\n              Pesos.\r\n  1882-83   4,395,089\r\n  1883-84   4,129,518\r\n  1884-85   3,707,434\r\n  1885-86   3,619,261\r\n  1886-87   3,899,975\r\n  1887-88   4,210,733\r\n  1888-89   4,762,885\r\n  1889-90   5,603,512\r\n  1890-91   5,941,947\r\n  1891-92   5,806,752\r\n  1892-93   5,630,416\r\n  1893-94   5,507,343\r\n  1894-95   5,666,207\r\n  1895-96   5,721,837\r\n\r\nThere were in circulation, in 1895-96, currency valued in pesos as\r\nfollows: 3,820,404 of Costa Rica bank notes, 2764 national paper\r\nmoney, 98,669 war-emission paper money, 1,500,000 coined silver\r\nmoney, 300,000 coined gold money, total 5,721,837; or 20.08 pesos per\r\ncapita of the population of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nAs above indicated, the Government of Costa Rica is beginning to\r\ndisplace the notes of the Banco de Costa Rica by others issued by the\r\ngovernment, maintained at par and guaranteed by a gold reserve or by\r\ngold certificates.\r\n\r\nThis monetary question is of such interest and importance, that the\r\nfollowing translation is given from such parts of the reports of the\r\nMinister of Finance as relate thereto.\r\n\r\n“The emission of gold certificates is necessary, as it would be\r\nimpossible to keep the gold coins in circulation so long as the\r\nquantity of paper money issued by the bank, is far greater. Again, in\r\norder to avoid the difficulties which would arise from the constant\r\nretirement of this paper money, the gold certificates must be issued\r\nto furnish an adequate supply of currency. In this way also the\r\nGovernment has the advantage of utilizing the quantities of gold in\r\ndeposit, and of acquiring by means of those certificates resources\r\nfor fresh coinage of gold pieces.”\r\n\r\n“In order to avoid embarrassment in the commercial and economic life\r\nof the country it has been agreed with the Banco de Costa Rica to\r\nmaintain parity between these certificates and its notes. By the\r\nmonetary law of October 24, 1896, also parity with the actual silver\r\npeso was established. It was further agreed that the ‘colon de oro,’\r\nthe new gold coin, should correspond in intrinsic value with this\r\nstandard of ratios.”\r\n\r\n“For these purposes, there had to be taken into consideration: First,\r\nthe actual state of the national wealth, estimated in the already\r\nestablished credit circulating medium; second, the average range\r\nof international exchange during a number of years, and third, the\r\naverage ratio of silver to gold during the same period. There had\r\nfurther to be considered the outstanding obligations of the interior\r\nand of the exterior debt, as well as pending negotiations as to\r\nexportable products, and the relation of the intrinsic value between\r\ngold and silver.”\r\n\r\n“In this way the following conclusion was reached: That the ‘colon\r\nde oro’ should contain 700 milligrams of fine gold, in order not to\r\ncomplicate the situation created by the circulating notes of the Bank\r\nof Costa Rica, and in order to include an average exchange of 110\r\nper cent. with respect to the pound sterling, and of 115 per cent.\r\nwith respect to the American gold, as well as to create a relation\r\nof 1 to 26 between silver and gold. In consequence of this and for\r\nthe purpose of giving to the ‘colon de oro’ the same fineness as has\r\nbeen given to the American gold coin, and as has been adopted by the\r\nUnion Latina, it was established that the ‘colon de oro’ should have\r\n778 milligrams of gold of 900-1000 fineness. Its relation to the gold\r\ncoins of either nations is as follows:\r\n\r\n  1 American gold dollar         Colones 2.1495\r\n  4 shillings sterling, gold         ”   2.0921\r\n  5 francs, gold                     ”   2.0737\r\n  4 marks, gold                      ”   2.0481\r\n\r\n“In the contract with the Banco de Costa Rica, it was agreed that\r\nthe Government should coin gold periodically. There are already\r\n600,000 ‘colones de oro’ in pieces of 10 colones in Costa Rica, and\r\nthe Government ordered furthermore a second emission of 400,000\r\ncolones in pieces of 20 colones each, which will soon be issued. It\r\nis further willing to coin half a million more in the near future.\r\nThe Costa Rican Bank, on the other hand, is obliged to retire a\r\ncorresponding amount of its notes from circulation, and later, as\r\nsoon as sufficient gold can be put in circulation, the exchange of\r\nbills is to be made by this bank in gold instead of silver.”\r\n\r\nThere are sufficient reasons for believing that the Costa Rican\r\nGovernment will succeed in the realization of this highly important\r\neconomic change without difficulty. As the Costa Rican Bank no\r\nlonger has the exclusive privilege of issuing paper money, new banks\r\nmust be established, with authority to issue circulating notes. As\r\nthese banks will have to keep a reserve of national gold coins for\r\nthe redemption of their paper money, there will be an abundance of\r\ncurrency of a fixed value. As the fineness of the ‘colon de oro’\r\nconstitutes the best type of international exchange, there will\r\nin the future be slight fluctuations, and this will prove a most\r\nvaluable guaranty of the stability of public wealth.\r\n\r\nThe value of the _National Government property_ is estimated at\r\n8,522,714.94 pesos.

Submarine cable transfers of money\r\ncost two per cent. more than by three days’ sight drafts with the\r\ncost of telegraphing added.\r\n\r\nUntil the 24th of March, 1897, the Bank of Costa Rica sold drafts on\r\nNew York for five points more than for those on London. Since the\r\n25th of March, 1897, the difference of exchange between those cities\r\nhas been eight per cent.\r\n\r\nThe rates on London, in October and November, 1897, were 127, and\r\nthose on New York were 135.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCosta Rica is a republic, the government of which is representative,\r\nthe representatives being classified so that one-half retires every\r\ntwo years. Since 1825 Costa Rica has had nine constitutions, the last\r\none having been promulgated in 1871.\r\n\r\nThe government is administered through three distinct branches;\r\nnamely, the legislative, executive and judicial.\r\n\r\nLegislative powers are vested in a single house whose members are\r\nchosen, one for every 8000 inhabitants, for a term of four years\r\nby an electoral college. This body is called the “Constitutional\r\nCongress” and assembles every year on May 1 for a sixty days’\r\nsession, which may be extended for thirty days more.\r\n\r\nThe executive power is vested in the President of the Republic who is\r\nelected for four years and has the power of naming or removing his\r\nfour cabinet ministers.\r\n\r\nAnnually, in May, Congress appoints, for a term of one year, three\r\nsubstitutes called “designados.” During the intervals between\r\nsessions of Congress legislative power is represented by a board of\r\nfive commissioners appointed by Congress.\r\n\r\nJudicial power is lodged in a Supreme Court and in subordinate\r\ntribunals as constituted by law. The judiciary is changed every four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSuffrage is restricted to popular conventions which choose a limited\r\nnumber of electors. These meet in a body called the electoral\r\nassembly and proceed to choose the President of the Republic and the\r\nCongressmen.\r\n\r\nThe Republic is divided into five Provinces and two Comarcas or\r\nTerritories. Both are divided into Cantones, and the Cantones are\r\nsubdivided into districts.\r\n\r\nThe Territories are represented in Congress in the same way as the\r\nProvinces.\r\n\r\nEach Canton has a municipal organization popularly elected and a\r\npolitical chief named by the President.\r\n\r\nIn each of the Provinces or Territories there is a Governor, and a\r\nmilitary commandant also named by the President, and a Judge of First\r\nInstance appointed by the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica, as soon as she became a member of the Central American\r\nConfederation, organized a judiciary of her own consisting of a\r\nsuperior court, several tribunals of first resort in the provinces,\r\nand the alcaldes of towns who were justices of the peace with\r\njurisdiction over petty affairs both civil and criminal. The Supreme\r\nCourt has since undergone many changes.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court is a Court of Law composed of five justices. Two\r\nCourts of second instance have three magistrates each.\r\n\r\nIn each of the Provinces and in the Comarca of Puntarenas there are\r\njudges having criminal and civil jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIn the chief towns of each Canton the alcaldes act in civil cases of\r\nminor importance, and in criminal cases are judges of petty offenses,\r\nand for graver charges are committing magistrates.\r\n\r\nIn the districts the justices of the peace and the police are charged\r\nwith maintaining the public peace and they act for small misdemeanors\r\nin a summary way.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal affairs there are an Inspector General of Hacienda, an\r\nalcalde of Hacienda, and a National Judge of Hacienda. There is also\r\na special judge of mines residing at San Mateo.\r\n\r\nPunishments are generally neither cruel nor protracted. They comprise\r\nconfinement in a prison or penitentiary, transportation, or a fine.\r\nThe penitentiary is on the island of San Lucas.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 Costa Rica codified its civil and penal jurisprudence,\r\namending the code materially seventeen years later. This has been\r\nthe basis of her legal progress and is in force except as modified\r\nby subsequent statutes. Among the more important amendments are\r\nthese: by the Penal Code in effect since 1880 the death penalty is\r\nabolished, as well as humiliating and cruel punishments; 1886 there\r\nwas promulgated a new Civil Code, in which are prominent civil\r\nmarriages, the right of divorce and the civil equality of woman.\r\n\r\nThe Code of Commerce in force, founded on Spanish customs, was issued\r\nin 1853. The Fiscal Code of to-day went into effect in 1885.\r\n\r\nThe Military Code of 1871 was superseded in 1884 by another more in\r\naccordance with modern institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Jury System in criminal cases has been in force since 1873.\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Statutes prevailing to-day were issued in 1867; the\r\nGeneral Police Regulations in 1849.\r\n\r\nThe “Ley Organica” of tribunals was framed in 1845 and modified\r\nslightly in 1852.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 there was promulgated the law for a creditor’s proceedings;\r\nthe mortgage law was passed in 1865.\r\n\r\nHigher and professional education was provided for in 1843 by a law\r\nknown as the “Statutes of the University of Santo Tomas,” and in 1886\r\nthere was enacted a law for common education.\r\n\r\nThe Registry of property and mortgages was opened in 1867, since\r\nwhich time various reforms have been introduced into the Mortgage Law.\r\n\r\nThere are besides many special laws, like the Mining Statutes\r\ndecreed in 1830; the Water Law of 1884 now in force; the Consular\r\nRegulations, and others.\r\n\r\nBy decree of 24th of November, 1863, the decimal system for moneys\r\nnow in use was adopted. By decree of 10th of July, 1884, the metric\r\nsystem was adopted for weights and measures.\r\n\r\nAll Costa Ricans between eighteen and fifty years of age are obliged\r\nto do military service according to law.\r\n\r\nThe army is divided into two parts; the first includes, under the\r\nhead of active service, all soldiers from eighteen to forty years of\r\nage; the second comprises all the rest under the head of “Reserve.”\r\n\r\nThere is a third division, known as the National Guard, including all\r\ncitizens capable of shouldering arms outside of the foregoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil 1540 Spain reserved for the Crown that part of the territory of\r\nVeragua lying west of the portion which had been granted to the heirs\r\nof Columbus, but in that year it was erected into a province called\r\nCosta Rica. According to the narrative of Colonel G. E. Church,\r\nwithin a period of sixty years from the date of its discovery some\r\nten feeble exploring and colonizing expeditions, mostly from Panama,\r\nwere fitted out to occupy Costa Rica, but they all proved disastrous,\r\nthe only result being the exasperation of the natives whom the\r\nSpaniards plundered, butchered and treated with signal barbarity.\r\n\r\nBetween 1560 and 1573 the limits of Costa Rica were defined and\r\nconfirmed by Philip II., those on the Atlantic Coast being the same\r\nas to-day, so far as Nicaragua is concerned.\r\n\r\nIn 1562 Juan Vasquez de Coronado was named Alcalde and Mayor of the\r\nProvince of Costa Rica and Veragua. He founded the City of Cartago\r\nwhich remained the capital until 1823.\r\n\r\nUp to 1622 fifteen governors succeeded Vasquez, but disappointed\r\nin their efforts to find gold, to enslave the Indian population,\r\nor to make the country prosperous, they allowed it to lapse into a\r\nbarbarism far worse than it was at the time of its discovery.\r\n\r\nBarrantes says that in 1622 it had but fifty Spanish families, and\r\nthese were in a condition of extreme poverty.\r\n\r\nA report, which the King ordered to be made about that time for\r\npurposes of taxation, stated: “In Costa Rica no mines of any metal\r\nare worked; no gold-washings, no indigo cultivation, no sugar-mill\r\nexist. The people cultivate only maize and wheat. There is no money.\r\nThe poverty is such that the flour and biscuits which are not\r\nconsumed are exchanged for necessary clothing.”\r\n\r\nWhen Gregorio de Sandoval was named Captain-General, in 1634, and\r\nreached his port from the Atlantic Coast, he noted the importance\r\nof having a better port than that then existing at the mouth of\r\nthe river Pacuare, and, therefore, in 1639 founded that of Matina,\r\nconnecting it by a mule-trail 102 miles long with Cartago.\r\n\r\nFrom 1666 to the end of the century both the Caribbean and the\r\nPacific coasts were ravaged by piratical expeditions.\r\n\r\nIn 1718 Diego de la Haya y Fernandez was appointed Captain-General.\r\nThe following year he reported to the King on the condition of Costa\r\nRica, which he pronounced the “poorest and most miserable of all\r\nAmerica. The current money is the cacao seed, there not being a piece\r\nof silver in the entire country. There is not an eatable sold in\r\nstreet or shop. Every family has to sow and reap what it consumes or\r\nexpends during the year. Even the Governor has to do this or perish.\r\nMeanwhile the inhabitants of the province are contentious, chimerical\r\nand turbulent, and among the whole of them there are not forty men of\r\nmedium capacity.”\r\n\r\nIn 1797 the governorship and military command were conferred on Tomas\r\nde Acosta, but after ruling for twelve years he wrote: “There is not\r\nin the entire monarchy a province so indigent as this, for some of\r\nthe inhabitants are clothed with the bark of trees, and others, that\r\nthey may go to church, hire and borrow from their friends.”\r\n\r\nThis may be said to have been the condition of the country when the\r\ndomination of Spain ended.\r\n\r\nThe fifty-eight Governors, who, since 1563, had followed the\r\nill-fated Vasquez de Coronado, had been little more than managers of\r\na neglected farm, which scarcely yielded sufficient to enable its\r\nlaborers to eke out a miserable, half-starved existence. They had\r\nkilled off or enslaved the indigenous population. Their poverty had\r\nprecluded the opening of roads or the clearing and cultivation of the\r\nlands, while the exactions of Spain and its barbarous political and\r\nfiscal policy had smothered all commercial interests. In fact, Costa\r\nRica had, during three centuries of Spanish domination, constantly\r\nretrograded, and when the Spaniard retired from it, he left it less\r\ncivilized than when he entered it in 1502.\r\n\r\nOn September 15, 1821, Costa Rica joined Nicaragua in a decree of\r\nindependence. On January 10, 1822, she proclaimed her union with the\r\nIturbide Empire of Mexico under “the plan of Iguala,” but in 1824\r\nshe resumed her independence, declared herself a Republic, elected\r\nJuan Mora as President, who remained in office for eight years, and\r\nbecame one of the United Provinces of Central America. This weak,\r\nunmanageable union underwent a slow disintegration from 1838 to 1839.\r\nIt fell in pieces for want of internal communications, like the old\r\nColumbian federation of New Granada, Venezuela and Ecuador.\r\n\r\nAmong the twenty-four presidents and dictators who have governed\r\nCosta Rica since 1824, several have been men of marked intelligence\r\nand devoted patriotism, and under their administration the country\r\nhas slowly emerged from its former depression, until to-day it may be\r\nsaid to be in a healthy political and commercial condition.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica is very much indebted to its first President, Juan Mora.\r\nOther successful Presidents were: Juan Rafael Mora, from 1850 to\r\n1859; General Tomas Guardia, from 1872 to 1876, and again from 1878\r\nto 1882; Bernardo Soto, from 1885 to 1889, and Rafael Iglesias, since\r\n1894.\r\n\r\nSince its independence there have been but few stirring events to\r\nagitate the country.
