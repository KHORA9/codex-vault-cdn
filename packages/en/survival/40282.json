Hart Merriam wrote his monograph of the subfamily Geomyinae in\r\n1895, he had no opportunity to examine fossil specimens. No doubt his\r\nphylogenetic conclusions and classification would have been greatly\r\ninfluenced had he enjoyed that opportunity because study of fossil\r\ngeomyids reveals the historic sequence of phyletic development, and\r\nthis sequence provides a firm basis for distinguishing specialized\r\nfrom primitive characters. The history of the Geomyinae has been\r\ncharacterized by the evolution of specializations. These evolutionary\r\ntrends begin, as we presently know them, with a generalized ancestral\r\nstock in the early Miocene. The direction, degree, and rate of change,\r\nbeginning with the primitive morphotype of the subfamily, has not been\r\nthe same in the various lineages. The classification within the\r\nsubfamily is based upon the phyletic interpretations of available data\r\nand the relationships they disclose. In turn, a new, and I hope more\r\nrealistic, phylogeny and classification is offered.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIALS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nRecent specimens were studied of all the known genera, subgenera and\r\n29 of the 36 living species. Most of the species not studied are\r\nmonotypic and have restricted geographic ranges. They are: _Geomys\r\ncolonus_, _G. fontanelus_, and _G. cumberlandius_, _Orthogeomys\r\ncuniculus_ and _O. pygacanthus_ of the subgenus _Orthogeomys_, and\r\n_O. dariensis_ and _O. matagalpae_ of the subgenus _Macrogeomys_.\r\nExamination of these modern species would not radically change the\r\nestimation of the degree of phyletic development of the genera and\r\nsubgenera involved. All of the major polytypic and widespread species\r\nwere studied.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the extinct genera _Dikkomys_, _Pliosaccomys_,\r\n_Pliogeomys_, _Nerterogeomys_, and _Parageomys_ also were studied,\r\nas were examples of the extinct species _Geomys quinni_, _Geomys\r\ntobinensis_, and _Orthogeomys onerosus_. Considerable fossil\r\nmaterial of living species, especially of the genera _Geomys_\r\nand _Pappogeomys_, was used.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the present account concerns mainly structural changes in\r\nthe subfamily Geomyinae at the level of subgenera and above, and the\r\ntemporal sequence of those changes, no attempt is made in the present\r\naccount to revise taxonomy below the level of subgenera. Considerable\r\nmodification of the classification below that level (for species and\r\nsubspecies) is to be expected in _Orthogeomys_ and Pleistocene taxa of\r\n_Geomys_ when available specimens are studied.\r\n\r\nI thank Prof. Robert W. Wilson for his assistance in securing fossil\r\ngeomyids for study, and those in charge of the paleontological\r\ncollections at the California Institute of Technology, Prof. Bryan\r\nPatterson, formerly of the Field Museum of Natural History, and Prof.\r\nClaude W.

Although the most critical sequences of\r\nthe fossil record are lacking, and although the existing fossils are\r\nmostly fragmentary and therefore seldom furnish ideally suitable data\r\nfor the interpretations that have been made, phylogenetic conclusions\r\ndrawn from fossil materials are superior to those drawn on other\r\nbases. The especially relevant characters are those disclosing\r\nprimary trends in the evolution of the modern assemblages. The higher\r\nsystematic categories recognized in the following account are based\r\nprimarily upon such characters.\r\n\r\nThe most important characters found are in the teeth, although several\r\nstructural changes in the lower jaw, especially those associated with\r\nthe insertion of cranial musculature, are almost as important.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prismatic Character of Molars_\r\n\r\nIn primitive geomyines the molar consisted of two columns united at\r\ntheir mid-points and forming a figure 8 or H-pattern (see Fig. 4B).\r\nBoth labial and lingual re-entrant folds were formed between the two\r\ncolumns. The primitive pattern is retained in the premolars of all\r\nknown Geomyinae. Therefore, in the earliest (Miocene) members of the\r\nsubfamily, the pattern of the molars was essentially like that of the\r\npremolars.\r\n\r\nIn Pliocene Geomyinae the two columns of the molars tend to merge into\r\none. This is evident on the worn occlusal surface of the teeth; the\r\nlateral re-entrant folds are shallow vertically and progressively\r\nrecede laterally until only a slight inflection remains. In the final\r\nstages of attrition, the inflection disappears and the tooth is a\r\nsimple elliptical column. In the Pleistocene the monoprismatic pattern\r\nappears at earlier stages of wear owing to the decrease in depth of\r\nthe re-entrant folds, and in Geomyinae of Recent time the initial\r\nstages of wear on the enamel cap of infants erase the last vestiges of\r\ntwo columns in the molar teeth.\r\n\r\nThe general trend in evolution, therefore, has been from a bicolumnar\r\nto a monocolumnar pattern. The particular patterns of wear\r\ncharacterizing each genus are described in detail beyond.\r\n\r\nThe third upper molar has evolved less rapidly than the first and\r\nsecond and in one of the modern lineages (tribe Geomyini) tends to\r\nretain at least a vestige of the primitive bicolumnar pattern in\r\nthe final stage of wear. Therefore, the loss of any trace of the\r\nbicolumnar pattern in M3 is considered to be a much specialized\r\ncondition. Unfortunately, the fossil record of the third upper molar\r\nis less complete than that for the first molar and second molar; the\r\ntooth drops out of its alveolus more often than does any one of the\r\nother molariform teeth and is seldom recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Character of Enamel Patterns_\r\n\r\nIn the primitive genera the enamel pattern is bilophate and the\r\nenamel loop (see Fig. 4B) is continuous on the occlusal surface of\r\na worn molar. Concomitant with the union of the double columns, the\r\nbilophodont pattern is reduced to a single loph, but the enamel still\r\ncompletely encircles the dentine.\r\n\r\nIn the molars of modern geomyines, the enamel loop is not continuous\r\nbut is interrupted on the sides of the crown by vertical tracts of\r\ndentine that are exposed at the occlusal surface of the tooth during\r\nearly stages of wear. Therefore, a continuous enamel band is to be\r\nfound only in a juvenal individual whose teeth have been subjected to\r\nonly slight attrition on the enamel cap. In molars lacking enamel on\r\nthe labial and lingual sides, anterior and posterior enamel plates, or\r\nblades, are found on each molar. The premolar also has an enamel plate\r\non the anterior surface and another on the posterior surface, and in\r\naddition both re-entrant angles are protected by a V-shaped investment\r\nof enamel. One or the other of the various plates can be reduced or\r\nlost accounting for the several distinctive tooth-patterns of the\r\nmodern geomyines. If loss occurs, it usually is the anterior plate in\r\nthe lower dentition and the posterior plate in the upper dentition,\r\nincluding the upper premolar. When reduction of the posterior plate of\r\nthe upper cheek teeth occurs, enamel is first lost from the labial\r\nside of the tooth, thus leaving only a short vestigial plate on the\r\nlingual end of the crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grooving of Incisors_\r\n\r\nThe incisors are smooth with no trace of a groove in the ancestral\r\nlineage. In the specialized assemblage (tribe Geomyini) pronounced\r\ngrooves are always developed on the anterior face of the upper\r\nincisor. The pattern of grooving is constant in each species and thus\r\nprovides characters of taxonomic worth for grouping species into\r\ngenera. The only inconstancy noted was an incisor of _Geomys_ from the\r\nTobin local fauna of the middle Pleistocene which has three grooves\r\nrather than the normal two (No. 6718 KU). The extra groove is an\r\nobvious abnormality, and the tooth was associated with others of the\r\nsame species from the same quarry that were normally grooved.\r\n\r\nGrooves on the lower incisors are unknown. The functional significance\r\nof grooving has been debated on numerous occasions in the literature.\r\nGrooves appear in a number of only distantly related rodents and in\r\nlagomorphs. The grooving occurs always in small herbivorous mammals,\r\nand in some way may be related to feeding habits.\r\n\r\nThe grooves provide a serrated cutting edge on the occlusal edge of\r\nthe upper incisor. In the genus _Geomys_, for example, the two\r\nincisors, including the slight space between them, present a total of\r\nfive serrations, which may facilitate cutting and piercing tuberous\r\nand fibrous roots upon which _Geomys_ feeds. Also the sulci would\r\nperform the same function as the longitudinal groove on the side of a\r\nbayonet, and would aid the animal in extracting its upper incisors\r\nfrom coarse, fibrous material. In gathering food, the gopher sinks its\r\nupper incisors into a root, and then, with the upper incisors firmly\r\nanchored, slices off small chunks by means of the lower incisors.\r\nTherefore, in pocket gophers, grooving may be an adaptation for\r\nfeeding on fibrous or woody material. Finally, grooves increase the\r\nenamel surface of the incisor without additional broadening of the\r\ntooth itself. There could be a selective advantage for sulcation if\r\nthe extra enamel and the serrate pattern strengthen the incisors,\r\nwhich are under heavy stress while penetrating or prying off pieces of\r\ncoarse material. Few broken incisors of pocket gophers are found.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Masseteric Ridge and Fossa_\r\n\r\nThis ridge and fossa are on the lateral surface of the ramus. The\r\ncrest on the ridge begins at the base of the angular process and\r\nterminates slightly anterior to the plane of the lower premolar. The\r\nmasseteric fossa receives the insertion of the rostral or superficial\r\ndivision of the masseter muscle. The mental foramen lies immediately\r\nanterior, or anteroventral, to the fossa.\r\n\r\nIn the ancestral lineage, the ridge is distinct but relatively low;\r\nthe masseteric fossa is shallow and is a poorly developed area for\r\nattachment of the superficial masseter muscle. In modern Geomyinae the\r\nridge is massive and forms a high crest, especially anteriorly, and\r\nthe masseteric fossa is a deep, prominent cup along the dorsal side\r\nof the crest. The elaboration of the crest and fossa evidently is\r\nassociated with an increase in size of the superficial masseter\r\nmuscle, which enlarges and provides increased power for the propalinal\r\ntype of mastication. A high crest has evolved independently in both\r\nmodern lineages, Thomomyini and Geomyini.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Basitemporal Fossa_\r\n\r\nThe name basitemporal fossa is suggested here to denote the deep pit\r\nthat lies between the lingual base of the coronoid process and the\r\nthird lower molar. The basitemporal fossa receives the insertion of\r\nthe temporal muscle. The fossa, which until now has not been named,\r\nis a unique feature in advanced Geomyinae, being unknown in either\r\nprimitive Geomyinae or in other rodents.\r\n\r\nThe temporal is one of several muscles holding the occlusal surface of\r\nthe lower molariform dentition firmly against the upper cheek teeth\r\nduring mastication. In primitive geomyines that masticate food\r\nby a planing action, the temporal muscle also moves the mandible\r\nposteriorly and food is ground between the enamel plates when the\r\nlower jaw is retracted as well as when it is moved forward.\r\n\r\nThe basitemporal fossa appears in late Pliocene geomyines and\r\nincreases the attachment surface of the temporal muscles that powers\r\nthe planing action important in utilizing woody and fibrous foods. The\r\nbasitemporal fossa developed in only one of the modern lineages (tribe\r\nGeomyini), the same lineage in which grooved incisors evolved.\r\nBoth features probably are adaptations for feeding on coarse food.\r\nThe fossa is not greatly developed in either the ancestral tribe\r\nDikkomyini or the modern tribe Thomomyini, although in some specimens\r\na slight depression marks the site of the basitemporal fossa.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 1.

In Pleistocene lineages of the modern tribe Geomyini,\r\nlong skulls and broad skulls evolved and have been termed\r\ndolichocephalic and platycephalic specializations, respectively by\r\nMerriam (1895:88-101). He correlated them with two diametrically\r\ndifferent mechanical methods of mastication.\r\n\r\nIn animals with dolichocephalic skulls the principal movements of the\r\nmandible in the masticatory process are anteroposterior. The resulting\r\npropalinal action of enamel plates in opposition to each other\r\ncharacterizes also animals with a generalized skull, and evidently is\r\nthe method of mastication in the primitive geomyines, but in animals\r\nwith a dolichocephalic skull the method is developed to a high degree\r\nby elongation of the cranium, mandible, and teeth. Both the mandibular\r\nand maxillary tooth-rows are relatively longer than in the generalized\r\nskull, providing a longer block for the planing action of the lower\r\nmolariform teeth. All teeth, especially P4 and M3, are longer. In M3\r\nthe heel (posterior loph) in particular is elongated. Both the\r\nanterior and posterior enamel plates usually are retained in M1 and\r\nM2.\r\n\r\nThe superficial (or rostral) masseter muscle, originates on the\r\nside of the rostrum and inserts in the masseteric fossa and on the\r\nmasseteric ridge. The deep masseter, especially the zygomatic part\r\nhaving its origin along the zygomatic arch, inserts on the angular\r\nprocess of the lower jaw. These two divisions of the masseter muscle\r\nhave a longer pull (forward) in the dolichocephalic skull than in a\r\nnon-dolichocephalic skull. The temporal and diagastric muscles retract\r\nthe lower jaws.\r\n\r\nOther, secondary, modifications of the dolichocephalic skull are\r\nshortening of the angular process of the mandible, broadening of the\r\nrostrum, and narrowing of the cranium and zygomata. Depth of the\r\nposterior part of the skull is unchanged. The skull appears to be deep\r\nand of nearly equal breadth from nasals to occiput. A good example of\r\na dolichocephalic skull is that of _Orthogeomys_ (see Fig. 1, C and\r\nD).\r\n\r\nIn the platycephalic skull, the principal masticatory movement of the\r\nmandible is anterooblique, to one side and then to the other. The\r\noblique passage of the enamel blades of the lower teeth across those\r\nof the upper teeth produces a shearing rather than planing action\r\n(Fig. 1E, F). The anterooblique movement of the lower jaw is possible\r\nbecause of major architectural changes in the cranium and mandible.\r\nThese changes include: (1) Broadening of the postrostral part of the\r\nskull, especially the occiput (mastoidal breadth equals or exceeds\r\nzygomatic breadth in skulls of some taxa); (2) flattening of the\r\nskull; (3) anteroposterior compression of the molariform teeth,\r\nespecially the molars. Therefore, the entire maxillary tooth-row is\r\nrelatively shorter than in the dolichocephalic skull. Only a vestige\r\nof the heel ordinarily remains on M3. The loss of the posterior enamel\r\nblades of P4, M1, and M2 eliminates unnecessary friction, and each of\r\nthese teeth is wider than long. The distance between the posterior\r\nends of the lower jaws is increased approximately in proportion to the\r\nextent that the occiput is widened. As a result of the flattening of\r\nthe skull the angular processes of the lower jaws are lateral to the\r\nzygomatic arches, and approximately on the same vertical level with\r\nthem. Consequently the insertions of masticatory muscles are shifted\r\nlaterally. This is especially true of the zygomatic division of the\r\ndeep masseter, which inserts on the angular process. Contraction of\r\nthat muscle division of one side of the skull moves the lower jaws\r\nobliquely forward. The diagastric and temporal muscles of course\r\nretract the lower jaws.\r\n\r\nThe platycephalic skull is the most specialized skull in the Geomyinae\r\nand is a result of the new (for the Geomyinae) method of mastication.\r\nThe subgenus _Cratogeomys_ (see Fig. 1, E and F) has a platycephalic\r\nskull. The trend toward platycephalic specialization has been the\r\nmajor feature of evolution in _Cratogeomys_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL RECORD\r\n\r\nThe fossil record of the subfamily Geomyinae begins in the early\r\nMiocene of western North America. No geomyids have been recovered from\r\nbeds of the late Miocene age. Beginning with the early Pliocene the\r\nfossil record becomes progressively more complete, and geomyines are\r\nrelatively abundant in deposits of late Pliocene and Pleistocene age.\r\nAlthough pocket gophers of the subfamily Geomyinae are rare in\r\nlower Miocene deposits, members of the subfamily Entoptychinae are\r\nrelatively common and highly diversified. Four genera and a number of\r\nspecies have been described (see Wood, 1936:4-25), and the subfamily\r\nranged widely in western North America. I interpret this to mean that\r\nthe geomyines were indeed uncommon in the early Miocene and their\r\ndistribution restricted since so few of their remains have been\r\nrecovered in comparison with entoptychines and the known records are\r\nonly from the northern part of the Great Plains. On the other hand,\r\nentoptychines enjoyed a widespread distribution in western North\r\nAmerica (see discussion beyond). Probably the geographic range of the\r\ngeomyines was largely allopatric to that of the more specialized\r\nentoptychines. The zone of fossoral adaptation for herbivorous\r\nrodents is ecologically narrow, and as a result competition is severe.\r\nAs a rule, the outcome of episodes of intergroup competition is\r\ngeographic exclusion. If these rodents were fossorial in the\r\nearly Miocene--their morphology suggests they were at least\r\nsemi-fossorial--mutually exclusive patterns of distribution are\r\nto be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiocene\r\n\r\n_Dikkomys_ is the only genus of the Geomyinae known from the early\r\nand middle Miocene. _Dikkomys matthewi_ was described by Wood (1936)\r\non the basis of isolated teeth from lower Harrison deposits\r\n(Arikareean in age) near Agate, Sioux County, Nebraska. Later,\r\nGalbreath (1948:316-317) described the features of an almost complete\r\nmandible recovered from the younger upper Rosebud deposits, now\r\nconsidered by MacDonald (1963:149-150) to be middle Miocene, near\r\nWounded Knee, Shannon County, South Dakota. More recently Black\r\n(1961:13) has described a new species, _Dikkomys woodi_, from the\r\nDeep River Formation, Meagher County, Montana. The Deep River Formation\r\nis late Hemingfordian (middle Miocene) in age. No remains of _Dikkomys_\r\nhave been identified in the extensive rodent fauna of the John Day beds\r\nof the lower Miocene of Oregon, although entoptychines are abundant in\r\nthese deposits.\r\n\r\nIn the present account, _Dikkomys_ is regarded as the ancestor from\r\nwhich the Pliocene and modern geomyines were derived. These probably\r\ndid not evolve from the subfamily Entoptychinae because the dentition\r\nof entoptychines, especially the premolars and third molars, was\r\nalready highly specialized by Miocene time.\r\n\r\nThe numerous records of _Thomomys_ and especially _Geomys_ reported\r\nfrom supposed Miocene or Pliocene deposits are without foundation (see\r\nMatthew, 1899:66; 1909:114, 116, 119; 1910:67, 72; 1923a:369; 1924:66;\r\nMatthew and Cook, 1909:382; Cook and Cook, 1933:49; and Simpson,\r\n1945:80). Most of the records of _Geomys_ date back to the description\r\nof _Geomys bisculcatus_ Marsh (1871:121) from the Loup Fork beds of\r\nNebraska (near Camp Thomas on the Middle Loup River). At first Marsh\r\nand other investigators thought these beds were of the late Miocene\r\nage. Subsequently the Loup Fork fauna was determined by Matthew\r\n(1923b) to be mostly early Pliocene (Clarendonian), but with a later\r\nPleistocene element. Recently, Schultz and Stout (1948:560) have shown\r\nthat the various Loup River faunas and also those from along the\r\nNiobrara River (Hay Springs, Rushville, Gordon local faunas) are of\r\nmiddle Pleistocene age, the fossil-bearing beds occurring just below\r\nthe Pearlette Ash. These beds are those termed the Loup Fork or North\r\nProng of Middle Loup by the earlier workers who supposed them to be of\r\nMiocene or Pliocene age. Both _Geomys_ and _Thomomys_ have been\r\nrecovered from most of these deposits, but they are no older than\r\nmiddle Pleistocene. This is not surprising in view of the primitive\r\nstructure of the geomyids known from Miocene and Pliocene beds, but\r\nthe supposed early appearance of _Geomys_ and _Thomomys_ led to much\r\nconfusion concerning geomyid evolution in the late Tertiary.\r\n\r\nThe dearth of geomyines in the Miocene is counterbalanced by the\r\nrelatively abundant and highly differentiated gophers of the subfamily\r\nEntoptychinae. They reached the zenith of their development in this\r\nperiod. Four genera and a number of species are known from the western\r\npart of the United States, mostly from beds along the Pacific\r\nCoast and in the northern part of the Great Plains. The great\r\ndiversification of the group in a relatively short period suggests\r\nprior movement into a new adaptive zone and subsequent specialization\r\nin different subzones and therefore an episode of radial adaptation.\r\nThe radiation of the entoptychines is discussed elsewhere in the\r\naccount of geomyid phylogeny, but it should be noted here that both\r\nthe Geomyinae and the Entoptychinae appear in the fossil record at\r\nabout the same time in the early Miocene. The principal distinguishing\r\nfeatures of each of the two lineages were well developed at the time\r\nof their first occurrence, and the entoptychines were the more\r\nsuccessful in early Miocene. The Entoptychinae are known only from\r\nthe early and middle Miocene, unless the earlier deposits of the\r\nJohn Day Formation of Oregon from which mammals have been recovered\r\nare considered to be latest Whitneyian (latest Oligocene); for\r\ncorrelations, see Wilson (1949:75). Both lineages likely had an\r\nearlier history extending back to their divergence in the Oligocene.\r\n\r\n\r\nPliocene\r\n\r\nThe oldest and most primitive Pliocene geomyine is _Pliosaccomys\r\ndubius_ Wilson (1936:20) from the Smith Valley local fauna of middle\r\nPliocene (Hemphillian) age in Nevada. According to Wilson (_op.\r\ncit._:15) the beds probably were deposited near the middle of\r\nHemphillian time. Shotwell (1956:730) recorded _Pliosaccomys dubius_\r\nfrom the McKay Reservoir and from the Otis Basin (1963:73) local\r\nfaunas of the middle Pliocene (Hemphillian) of Oregon, and Green\r\n(1956:155) has recovered remains of _Pliosaccomys_ (cf. _dubius_) from\r\nthe Wolf Creek local fauna, uppermost part of the lower Pliocene (late\r\nClarendonian in age), of Shannon County, South Dakota. Recently, James\r\n(1963:101) has described a second species, _Pliosaccomys wilsoni_, of\r\nthis primitive genus. The new species was found in early Pliocene\r\ndeposits (late Clarendonian) from the Nettle Spring local fauna\r\n(Apache Canyon), in the Cuyama Valley, Ventura County, California.\r\n_Pliosaccomys wilsoni_ does not differ greatly from _P. dubius_;\r\nhowever, the few differences in dental characters seem to warrant\r\nspecific recognition. The reduction of cusps on the metalophid of p4\r\nfrom three (_dubius_) to two (_wilsoni_) and the lack of accessory\r\ncuspules on the protolophid of p4 in _wilsoni_ are probably\r\nspecializations, suggesting that _P. dubius_ even though the more\r\nrecent in age is the less advanced of the two. _P. wilsoni_ is known\r\nonly from a lower jaw of a young individual that had dp4 in place,\r\nalong with m1 and m2. The permanent premolar was in the process of\r\nerupting, and the deciduous tooth was removed so that the unworn\r\nsurface of p4 could be examined.\r\n\r\n_Pliosaccomys_ occurred geographically in the area that the\r\nEntoptychinae had occupied in the early Miocene. The Smith Valley\r\nmaterial includes dentitions in almost all stages of wear and the\r\nchronological sequences in the development of the patterns of wear can\r\nbe reconstructed. An understanding of the dental patterns of the\r\nprimitive geomyines is based mostly on the interpretation of the\r\nstages of wear in _Pliosaccomys_.\r\n\r\nNo other pocket gopher is known from the area in which _Pliosaccomys_\r\noccurred, and it is unknown after middle Hemphillian age.\r\n_Pliosaccomys_ has closer affinities with _Dikkomys_ of the early\r\nMiocene than with any geomyid of the modern assemblage and gives no\r\nclue to the origin of the lineage culminating in the modern pocket\r\ngophers of the tribe Geomyini.\r\n\r\n_Pliogeomys buisi_ Hibbard (1954:353) was found in the Buis Ranch\r\nlocal fauna, of latest middle Pliocene, on the west side of Buckshot\r\nArroyo, Beaver County, Oklahoma. The original material included a\r\nright ramus bearing the premolar and first two molars (the holotype)\r\nand five isolated premolars and molars. One of the molars is slightly\r\nworn and from an immature individual. One premolar is a deciduous\r\ntooth. Hibbard (_op. cit._:342) identified the beds from which he\r\nobtained the Buis Ranch local fauna as from the lowermost part of the\r\nUpper Pliocene. Moreover, he judged the Buis Ranch local fauna to be\r\nonly slightly older than the Saw Rock Canyon local fauna of Seward\r\nCounty in southwestern Kansas. Previously (Hibbard, 1953:408-410),\r\nthe Saw Rock Canyon local fauna had been assessed as older than\r\nthe Rexroad local faunas (latest late Pliocene) and, therefore,\r\nrepresentative of the early part of the late Pliocene. More recently,\r\nHibbard (1956:164) identified the Buis Ranch beds as part of the\r\nOgallala Formation, which here occurs unconformably just beneath the\r\nRexroad Formation (composed of strata nearly all of late Pliocene\r\nage). Therefore, he regarded the Buis Ranch beds as latest middle\r\nPliocene in age. Hibbard (1954:356) suggested that pocket gopher\r\nremains from the Saw Rock Canyon local fauna were referable to\r\n_Pliogeomys buisi_, and, in effect, tentatively assigned them to\r\n_Pliogeomys_ (in his description of the genus Hibbard remarked that\r\nthe upper incisor is bisulcate as in _Geomys_, and the only upper\r\nincisor that he mentions was one of the Saw Rock Canyon fossils\r\nand not part of the Buis Ranch material). _Pliogeomys_ has closer\r\naffinities with modern pocket gophers of the tribe Geomyini than it\r\ndoes with the middle Pliocene genus _Pliosaccomys_.\r\n\r\nThe pocket gopher fauna known from the late Pliocene was more varied\r\nthan the faunas known from any earlier time. In addition to the\r\nextinct _Pliogeomys_, which occurs in early late Pliocene (see\r\ndiscussion above), the living genera _Zygogeomys_, _Geomys_,\r\n_Pappogeomys_ (in the sense used on p. 534), and _Thomomys_\r\nfirst appear in the late Pliocene. The only other living genus,\r\n_Orthogeomys_, makes its first appearance in the late Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nThe earliest record of the genus _Thomomys_ is based on a fragment of\r\na left mandibular ramus bearing p4 and m1, _Thomomys gidleyi_ Wilson\r\n(1933b:122), from the Hagerman local fauna of Twin Falls County,\r\nIdaho. Wilson (_loc. cit._) was uncertain as to age (late Pliocene or\r\nearly Pleistocene) but subsequently (1937:38 and 67-70) settled on the\r\nmiddle part of the late Pliocene. Hibbard (1958:11) later considered\r\nthe age as early Pleistocene (suggesting that the deposits accumulated\r\nin the Aftonian interglacial interval) but subsequently (Hibbard _et\r\nal._, 1965:512), on the basis of potassium argon age determinations,\r\nalso settled on late Pliocene.\r\n\r\nRemains of _Nerterogeomys_ [=_Zygogeomys_] have been found in the\r\nBenson local fauna, Cochise County, Arizona, and the Rexroad local\r\nfauna of Kansas. This early Blancan gopher first was described as\r\n_Geomys minor_ by Gidley (1922:123), and was later referred by Gazin\r\n(1942:487) to his new genus _Nerterogeomys_. Hibbard (1950:138)\r\nidentified specimens from the Fox Canyon locality, one of the\r\nlocalities of Meade County, Kansas, where the Rexroad local fauna is\r\npreserved, as _Nerterogeomys_, and tentatively referred them to the\r\nspecies _N. minor_. _Nerterogeomys_ cf. _minor_ has been recovered\r\nalso from Locality 3 of the Rexroad local fauna (Hibbard, 1950:171)\r\nof Meade County, Kansas. Apparently these are also the small gophers\r\nabout which Franzen (1947:58) wrote. She assigned them to the genus\r\n_Geomys_, and they may actually be a primitive form of _Geomys_ that\r\nrepresents an intermediate stage in the development of the enamel\r\npattern from the uninterrupted loops of the ancestor to the\r\ndiscontinuous pattern of modern _Geomys_. I favor this interpretation;\r\nthe evidence, however, is inconclusive, and I have, therefore,\r\nreluctantly allocated them, along with the other specimens of\r\n_Nerterogeomys_, to the genus _Zygogeomys_. In an early paper,\r\nHibbard (1938:244) erroneously referred the same specimens, two upper\r\npremolars of a young individual, to the genus _Thomomys_, and the same\r\nmaterial was identified with the genus _Geomys_, also without specific\r\nassignment, in a later paper (Hibbard, 1941b:278). _Thomomys_ is\r\nunknown from the late Pliocene of the Great Plains. The specimens\r\npreviously referred to _Nerterogeomys_ are assigned to the genus\r\n_Zygogeomys_ for the first time in this report; for a discussion of\r\nthe systematic arrangement see the accounts beyond. The type and\r\nparatype of _Nerterogeomys_ from the Benson local fauna of Arizona\r\nhave no indication of enamel reduction.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the genus _Geomys_ from the late Pliocene were referred\r\nto the large _Geomys quinni_ McGrew, first by Franzen (1947:55) and\r\nlater by Hibbard and Riggs (1949:835) and Hibbard (1950:171). _Geomys\r\nquinni_ has been obtained from the Fox Canyon locality and Locality 3\r\nof the Rexroad local fauna. At Locality 3, both _Zygogeomys_ (cf.\r\n_minor_) and _Geomys quinni_ have been found together, but _Geomys\r\nquinni_ can be distinguished by its much larger size and the advanced\r\nenamel pattern of the cheek teeth (see systematic accounts beyond).\r\nAll age classes are represented among the specimens of _Geomys\r\nquinni_; therefore, it seems unlikely that the smaller gophers\r\nreferred to _Zygogeomys_ are actually the young of _Geomys quinni_.\r\nHibbard (personal communication, May, 1966) informed me that specimens\r\nof _Geomys_ from the late Pliocene (Fox Canyon and Rexroad Locality 3)\r\nare erroneously referred to _G. quinni_. According to Hibbard, this\r\nmaterial represents instead two distinct undescribed species,\r\ndescriptions of which have been submitted by him for publication.\r\nAllocation of late Pliocene specimens of _Geomys quinni_ to other\r\nspecies will restrict _quinni_ to the early Pleistocene.\r\n\r\n_Cratogeomys bensoni_ Gidley (1922:123) was of medium size. The name\r\nwas based on an upper incisor bearing a single median sulcus and an\r\nassociated lower jaw containing all of the cheek teeth from the Benson\r\nlocal fauna, Cochise County, Arizona. Additional lower jaws carrying\r\nvarious teeth also were recovered. The specimens might just as well\r\nhave been assigned to the genus _Pappogeomys_ since the lower\r\ndentitions of all the genera of the tribe Geomyini have the same\r\nenamel pattern, and the subgenera _Pappogeomys_ and _Cratogeomys_\r\nhave upper incisors with median grooves. The specimens are too\r\nfragmentary to warrant more than generic identification. Mainly\r\nbecause of their late Pliocene age and primitive traits the specimens\r\nare here regarded as early representatives of the subgenus\r\n_Pappogeomys_. Discovery of the upper molariform dentition would make\r\na more precise assignment possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPleistocene\r\n\r\nNumerous specimens of geomyids from many localities and horizons are\r\navailable from the Pleistocene of North America. Specimens of the\r\ngenera _Geomys_ and _Thomomys_ are especially common. Few specimens\r\nare known of the genera _Orthogeomys_ and _Pappogeomys_, especially\r\nfrom the early and middle Pleistocene, owing, probably, to slight\r\nknowledge of the early Pleistocene of México where these two genera\r\nare thought to have evolved (see map, Figure 2). This lack of\r\nknowledge about early Pleistocene deposits in México is a handicap in\r\nthe present instance since the center of differentiation for several\r\nof the modern genera is judged to have been in México, probably on,\r\nand at the edge of, the Central Plateau. The relative abundance of the\r\nremains of _Geomys_ and _Thomomys_ from Pleistocene deposits farther\r\nnorth, and the marked absence of other genera, may mean that\r\n_Orthogeomys_ and _Pappogeomys_ did not range northward from southern\r\nand central México in most of the Pleistocene. One species of\r\n_Pappogeomys_ eventually ranged into the southwestern United States in\r\nthe late Pleistocene (toward the end of the Wisconsin) and it occurs\r\nthere today, but the genus is essentially Mexican.\r\n\r\nThe fossil record of _Zygogeomys_, as the genus is here understood,\r\nevidently continued in the United States will into the Middle\r\nPleistocene, depending upon the stratigraphic interpretation of the\r\nage of the Curtis Ranch local fauna from southeastern Arizona. Hibbard\r\n(1958:25) regarded the Curtis Ranch local fauna as Irvingtonian in\r\nage, a local fauna that lived either in the late Kansan glacial or the\r\nYarmouthian interglacial, and his correlation is tentatively followed\r\nhere. In deposits laid down later than those of Irvingtonian age no\r\nremains of _Zygogeomys_ have been found. Today a single species exists\r\nas a relic in the mountains of central México and _Zygogeomys_ may\r\nhave retreated southward to its present refugium in the late\r\nPleistocene. Perhaps, _Zygogeomys_ occurred in northern México and the\r\nsouthwestern United States in the early and middle Pleistocene (see\r\nFig. 2), occupying the area between the ranges of _Pappogeomys_ to the\r\nsouth and _Geomys_ to the north. Competition with _Pappogeomys_, and\r\nespecially _Geomys_, during Irvingtonian time may have extirpated\r\n_Zygogeomys_ over most of this area, and by late Pleistocene\r\n(Sangamon) much of the former range of _Zygogeomys_ came to be\r\noccupied by one or the other of its competitors. The occurrence of\r\n_Geomys garbanii_ in southern California (see White and Downs, 1961)\r\nand the unidentified species of _Geomys_ in Aguascalientes (Mooser,\r\n1959; for faunal correlation, see Hibbard and Mooser, 1963), both\r\nfrom deposits of Irvingtonian age, supports this suggestion.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 2. Probable distribution of the Subfamily\r\n       Geomyinae in the early Pleistocene (late Blancan), depicting\r\n       major areas of differentiation of the modern genera.\r\n\r\n    1. _Thomomys_\r\n    2. _Geomys_\r\n    3. _Zygogeomys_\r\n    4. _Pappogeomys_\r\n    5. _Orthogeomys_\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomomys_\r\n\r\nThe earliest Pleistocene records of _Thomomys_ are mostly isolated\r\nteeth. Although they can be identified as genus _Thomomys_, most of\r\nthe materials are too fragmentary to be identified to species. In\r\n_Thomomys_ two distinct patterns of occlusal surfaces of the molars\r\ncan be recognized: the generalized elliptical pattern in the subgenus\r\n_Pleisothomomys_, not unlike the pattern in other geomyids, and the\r\npear-shaped pattern in the subgenus _Thomomys_, which results from\r\nconstriction of the upper molars on the labial side and constriction\r\nof the lower molars on the lingual side. Some fossils assigned to\r\n_Thomomys_ were not examined with this distinction in mind by\r\nthe persons who made the assignments. Consequently some of the\r\nidentifications now in the literature may be subject to change.\r\n\r\nThree occurrences of _Thomomys_ are from the early and middle\r\nPleistocene, with a possible fourth (depending upon the age of the Hay\r\nSprings local fauna of Nebraska). The earliest Pleistocene record is\r\nfrom the Broadwater-Lisco beds along the North Platte River in Morrill\r\nCounty, western Nebraska. Possibly the specimen from there was\r\nmisidentified. Those beds are Lower Pleistocene, and are regarded by\r\nSchultz and Stout (1948:560-561, 573) and by Hibbard (1958:11), as\r\nhaving been deposited mostly during the Aftonian interglacial. There\r\nis also some indication that some of the strata were deposited late\r\nin the Nebraskan glaciation. There are no other early Pleistocene\r\nrecords of _Thomomys_. Savage (1951:228) reported the genus from\r\nthe Irvington local fauna, Alameda County, California. The specimens\r\nwere not identified to species, although they were described as\r\nindistinguishable from _Thomomys bottae_. Paulson (1961:137) recorded\r\nspecimens from the Cudahy local fauna, Meade County, Kansas. These\r\nfragmentary specimens are referable to the subgenus _Thomomys_, owing\r\nto the strong constriction of the molars, but have not been identified\r\nto species. The Cudahy is an Irvingtonian local fauna, and is\r\nconsidered to have been deposited during the late Kansan glaciation.\r\nThe stratum containing the Cudahy local fauna immediately underlies\r\nthe Pearlette Ash. The Cudahy material includes five isolated molars\r\nand a fragmentary ramus bearing only the premolar. The genus\r\n_Thomomys_ has been recovered also from the Hay Springs local fauna\r\nin Sheridan County, northwestern Nebraska, by Shultz and Tanner\r\n(1957:71). The Hay Springs local fauna is considered to have been\r\ndeposited in late Kansan glaciation or in early Yarmouth interglacial\r\nby Shultz and Tanner (_op. cit._:69), or of Irvingtonian age; however,\r\nHibbard (1958:25) regarded the beds containing this fauna as Illinoian\r\n(thus post-Irvingtonian in age), and equivalent in age to the Berends\r\nlocal fauna of Oklahoma and the Butler Springs and Mt. Scott local\r\nfaunas of Kansas. The _Thomomys_ from Hay Springs local fauna has not\r\nbeen referred to species.\r\n\r\nThe relative abundance of _Geomys_, and rarity of _Thomomys_, in Great\r\nPlains fossil beds of early and middle Pleistocene is probably due to\r\nallopatric distributions of the two genera. The Great Plains area was\r\nevidently the center of distribution and differentiation of _Geomys_.\r\nPerhaps _Thomomys_ evolved earlier to the west, in the Great Basin and\r\nPacific Coastal regions, and not on the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nUpper Pleistocene records of _Thomomys_ are more common. The genus\r\nwas widespread in beds identified with the Illinoian and Sangamon\r\nand extended its range eastward to the Atlantic Coast. Stephens\r\n(1960:1961) reported _Thomomys_ from the Doby Springs local fauna,\r\nHarper County, northwestern Oklahoma. The material (34 isolated teeth)\r\nwas too fragmentary to permit assignment to species. The molars are\r\nconstricted on one side, indicative of the subgenus _Thomomys_, like\r\nthe Cudahy specimens reported by Paulson (see discussion above).\r\nStephens erroneously mentioned that the enamel plate on the posterior\r\nface of the upper premolar is unique in _Thomomys_; this plate occurs\r\nalso in _Zygogeomys_. The Doby Springs local fauna was recovered from\r\nbeds that have been identified as Illinoian deposits, and it is\r\ncorrelated with the Berends local fauna in Beaver County, Oklahoma,\r\nand the Butler Springs local fauna in Meade County, Kansas (see\r\nStephens, _op. cit._: 1700).\r\n\r\nLocal faunas in Maryland and Florida of Rancholabrean age\r\ninclude _Thomomys_, in every instance referable to the subgenus\r\n_Pleisothomomys_ on the basis of unconstricted molars. _Thomomys\r\npotomacensis_ (Gidley and Gazin, 1933), from Cumberland Cave local\r\nfauna, Allegany County in western Maryland, is the type of the genus\r\n_Pleisothomomys_ Gidley and Gazin (1933:354). _Pleisothomomys_ is here\r\nregarded as a subgenus. The material used in the original description\r\nincluded four lower jaws, one with a complete dentition. Hibbard\r\n(1958:25) pointed out that the Cumberland Cave assemblage is a\r\ncomposite fauna including both glacial and interglacial forms. He\r\nplaced the stratigraphic position of the fauna as definitely Upper\r\nPleistocene, probably deposited in both Illinoian glaciation and\r\nduring the Sangamon interglacial. _T. potomacensis_ is significantly\r\nlarger than _T. orientalis_ Simpson (1928:6), from the Saber-tooth\r\nCave local fauna, Citrus County, Florida. Simpson's material included\r\na rostral fragment with an incisor, premolar, and first molar. The\r\nSaber-tooth Cave local fauna is regarded by Kurten (1965:219) as\r\nhaving been recovered from Sangamon deposits. _Thomomys_ is unknown\r\nfrom Wisconsin deposits in the eastern United States, and today the\r\ngenus does not occur east of the Great Plains.\r\n\r\n_Thomomys_ of Rancholabrean provincial age from the western United\r\nStates and México is known only from Wisconsin beds.\r\n\r\nThree extinct species of _Thomomys_, all referable to the subgenus\r\n_Thomomys_, have been described. _Thomomys microdon_ Sinclair\r\n(1905:146), based on the rostral portion of a skull without a\r\nmandible, is from the Potter Creek Cave local fauna, Shasta County,\r\nCalifornia, and has been recovered also from Samwel Cave, Shasta\r\nCounty, California. _T. microdon_ closely resembles _Thomomys\r\nmonticola_ that lives in the area today. _Thomomys scudderi_ Hay\r\n(1921:614) is from the Fossil Lake (or Christmas Lake) local fauna in\r\ncentral Oregon. Elftman (1931:10-11) referred these specimens to\r\n_Thomomys townsendii_, and he considered _T. scudderi_ to be a synonym\r\nof _T. townsendii_. Davis (1937:156-158) disagreed with Elftman\r\nconcerning the taxonomic status of _T. scudderi_, which he regarded as\r\na valid species. According to Davis, _T. scudderi_ is more closely\r\nallied to _Thomomys bottae_ than to _T. townsendii_. Cope (1878:389;\r\n1889:160-165) had referred the same specimens to _Thomomys clusius_\r\n(now _Thomomys talpoides clusius_). Cope considered the beds to be\r\nPliocene in age. In all accounts of the Fossil Lake local fauna up to\r\nHay (1921), the specimens of _Thomomys_ were referred to the species\r\n_clusius_, _talpoides_, or _bulbivorus_ (see Elftman, _loc. cit._).\r\nThe Fossil Lake local fauna is currently considered as being of\r\nRancholabrean provincial age, probably dating from the Wisconsin\r\nglacial maximum when the lake reached its greatest size. The third\r\nextinct species described from the Wisconsin is _Thomomys vetus_ Davis\r\n(1937:156), also from the Fossil Lake local fauna in Lake County,\r\nOregon. Davis pointed out that _T. vetus_ differs from _T. scudderi_\r\nHay, of the same fauna, in larger size and other cranial details, and\r\nthat it is closely allied to the living species _Thomomys townsendii_,\r\nand not to _Thomomys talpoides_, which is the only species of\r\n_Thomomys_ living in the area today.\r\n\r\n_Thomomys townsendii_ was recovered by Gazin (1935:299) from the\r\nAmerican Falls beds (probably Wisconsin deposits) in Idaho.\r\n\r\n_Thomomys talpoides_ is reported from the Howard Ranch local fauna in\r\nHardeman County, western Texas, by Dalquest (1965:69-70), who referred\r\nthe isolated teeth to _T. talpoides_ on geographic grounds, apparently\r\non the erroneous assumption that _T. talpoides_ was the species of\r\n_Thomomys_ nearest geographically to Hardeman County. Hay (1927:259)\r\nreported _Thomomys fuscus_ [= _Thomomys talpoides_] from late\r\nPleistocene beds near Wenatchee, Chelan County, Washington. Hibbard\r\n(1951:229) recorded _Thomomys talpoides_ from late Pleistocene\r\ndeposits in Greeley County, Kansas, and Walters (1957:540) reported\r\nthe same species from late Pleistocene deposits in Clark County,\r\nKansas. According to Hibbard (1958:14) other remains reported as _T.\r\ntalpoides_ have been recovered from numerous areas of Wisconsin\r\nglacial drift in western North America.\r\n\r\n_Thomomys bottae_ has been identified from Wisconsin age deposits in\r\nwestern North America, as follows: Burnet Cave, Gaudalupe Mt., New\r\nMexico (Schultz and Howard, 1935:280); Carpinteria Asphalt, California\r\n(Wilson, 1933a:70); McKittrick Asphalt, Kern County, California (J. R.\r\nSchultz, 1938:206); Rancho La Brea, Los Angeles County, California\r\n(Dice, 1925:125--specimens described as a new subspecies, _T. b.\r\noccipitalis_); Papago Springs Cave, Santa Cruz County, Arizona\r\n(Skinner, 1942:150 and 158--probably _bottae_, but possibly _umbrinus_\r\non the assumption that the two are specifically instead of\r\nsubspecifically distinct); Isleta Cave, Bernalillo County, New Mexico\r\n(Harris and Findley, 1964:115--some of these fossils may be\r\npost-Wisconsin in age); Potter Creek Cave and Samwel Cave, Shasta\r\nCounty, California (Sinclair, 1905:146--identified as _T. leucodon_,\r\nnow a subspecies of _T. bottae_; also see Hay, 1927:214-215).\r\n\r\n_Thomomys umbrinus_ has been reported from San Josecito Cave, Nuevo\r\nLeón, México (Russell, 1960:542); Upper Bercerra, México (Hibbard,\r\n1955a:51--identified only as _Thomomys_ sp., but undoubtedly referable\r\nto _T. umbrinus_). Post-Wisconsin remains of _Thomomys umbrinus_ are\r\nreported by Alvarez (1964:6) from capa II and capa III of the Cueva La\r\nNopalera, southwestern Hidalgo. Hay (1927:222-223) reported specimens\r\nof the genus _Thomomys_ from Wisconsin deposits in Hawver Cave,\r\nEldorado County, California, but did not assign them to species.\r\nGilmore (1947:158) found the remains of _Thomomys umbrinus_ in cave\r\ndeposits near Quatro Ciénegas in central Coahuila. These cave deposits\r\nmay have been laid down during the Wisconsin, but more likely\r\naccumulated in the post-Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zygogeomys_\r\n\r\nRemains found in the Curtis Ranch local fauna, Cochise County, in\r\nsoutheastern Arizona are regarded as of middle Pleistocene age. See\r\nGazin (1942:481-484), Wilson (1937:39-40), Hibbard (1958:25), and\r\nHibbard _et al._ (1965:510-511). Although some question as to the\r\nexact age of the Curtis Ranch local fauna still seems to exist, most\r\nauthorities on the Pleistocene agree that the age is not Pliocene and\r\nthat it is older than Rancholabrean. Gidley (1922:122) described the\r\npocket gopher found in the Curtis Ranch beds as _Geomys parvidens_,\r\nwhich is preoccupied by _Geomys parvidens_ Brown (1908:194), a name\r\nproposed for the pocket gopher from the Conard Fissure of Arkansas;\r\ntherefore, Hay (1927:136) proposed the name _Geomys persimilis_ for\r\nthe Curtis Ranch species to replace _Geomys parvidens_ Gidley.\r\n_Geomys persimilis_ Hay became the type species of Gazin's genus\r\n_Nerterogeomys_ (1942:507). In this paper, _Nerterogeomys_ is\r\nconsidered to be a junior synonym of _Zygogeomys_.\r\n\r\n_Zygogeomys persimilis_ is represented by a rostral fragment bearing\r\nall the cheek teeth on the left side and the upper incisors. In\r\naddition, two lower jaws, one with the first three cheek teeth,\r\nare referred to the species (see Gazin, 1942:507). The fossils\r\nidentified as _Geomys_ from the Arroyo San Francisco, Cedazo fauna,\r\nin Aguascalientes, México, by Mooser (1959:413) may be referable\r\ninstead to _Zygogeomys_. I have not seen the specimens and no figures\r\nare available; Mooser states that a cranium was recovered. If either\r\nthe upper premolar or third molar is in place, generic identification\r\ncould be made with reasonable certainty. No other fossils of\r\n_Zygogeomys_ have been uncovered in late Pleistocene deposits and the\r\nsignificance of the absence of _Zygogeomys_ has been discussed in an\r\nearlier paragraph of this section. _Geomys_ has not been found so far\r\nsouth as Aguascalientes, but _Zygogeomys_ occurs farther south now and\r\npresumably had a more extensive range on the plateau to the north in\r\nthe Pleistocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geomys_\r\n\r\n_Geomys_ is common in Pleistocene deposits, especially on the Great\r\nPlains. Certainly the center of differentiation for _Geomys_ was\r\nin this region, although at times, probably when conditions were\r\nfavorable, _Geomys_ expanded its range into adjacent areas, reaching\r\nthe Pacific Coast in Irvingtonian times and the Atlantic Coast at the\r\ntime of the Illinoian glaciation. The earliest Pleistocene records\r\nof the genus are from the Great Plains. McGrew (1944:49) described\r\n_Geomys quinni_ from the Sand Draw local fauna, Brown County,\r\nNebraska, considered by Hibbard (1958:11) to be Nebraskan in age. As\r\nmentioned in the account of Pliocene geomyids, _Geomys quinni_ occurs\r\nalso in the late Pliocene deposits of southwestern Kansas. Also,\r\n_Geomys quinni_ occurs in the Broadwater-Lisco local fauna of Morrill\r\nand Garden counties, western Nebraska (Barbour and Schultz, 1937:3;\r\nSchultz and Stout, 1948:560-563; Schultz _et al._, 1951: table 1). The\r\nBroadwater-Lisco is currently regarded as Aftonian deposits (Schultz\r\nand Stout, _loc. cit._; Hibbard, 1958:11). Hibbard (1956:174)\r\nidentified _Geomys quinni_ from the Deer Park local fauna, probably\r\ndeposited during the early Aftonian interglacial, of Meade County,\r\nKansas. Strain (1966:36) described _Geomys paenebursarius_ on the\r\nbasis of fossils obtained from early Pleistocene deposits of the\r\nHudspeth local fauna from western Hudspeth County in the Trans-Pecos\r\nof Texas. The Hudspeth fossils were probably deposited during the\r\nAftonian interglacial. From Kingman County, Kansas, Hibbard (_op.\r\ncit._: 164) recovered isolated teeth of _Geomys_ from the Dixon local\r\nfauna, regarded by him (_op. cit._:153-154) as deposited during the\r\nlatest Nebraskan glaciation, and correlated by him with the Sand Draw\r\nlocal fauna of Nebraska. Hibbard (1958:11) later regarded the Dixon as\r\na transitional fauna between Nebraskan and Aftonian. The remains of\r\n_Geomys_ from the Dixon are known only from isolated teeth. The teeth\r\nare small, and suggest that a smaller species of _Geomys_ may have\r\noccurred along with the more common and larger _G. quinni_ during the\r\nearly Pleistocene (see discussion beyond of the Saunders _Geomys_).\r\n_Geomys quinni_ was widespread and common throughout the central Great\r\nPlains from the late Pliocene (Rexroad fauna) through the early\r\nPleistocene (Nebraskan and Aftonian deposits).\r\n\r\nHibbard (1956:179) referred the pocket gopher remains taken from the\r\nSaunders local fauna in Meade County, Kansas, to _Geomys tobinensis_,\r\na small species having continuous enamel bands around the lower\r\npremolar in younger specimens. The Saunders local fauna was deposited\r\nin the late Aftonian and is younger than the Deer Park local fauna\r\ndiscussed above. Paulson (1961:138) later pointed out that the\r\nSaunders _Geomys_ is distinct from _Geomys tobinensis_; hence, the\r\nsmall pocket gopher from the Saunders local fauna is probably an\r\nunnamed species, perhaps more closely allied to _paenebursarius_\r\nthan to _quinni_. The small _Geomys_ reported from the Aftonian\r\nBroadwater-Lisco local fauna of Nebraska (Schultz and Stout, 1948:563)\r\nmay also be the same as the Saunders pocket gopher, but the smaller\r\nadult specimens occurring in the same bed with larger specimens\r\nprobably are females and the larger specimens males. In all living\r\nGeomyini females have smaller skulls than males.\r\n\r\nThe Irvingtonian provincial age is currently regarded as Middle\r\nPleistocene and includes the late Kansan glaciation (that part\r\noccurring after the glacial maximum) and the Yarmouthian interglacial\r\n(see Hibbard _et al._, 1965:512-514). The Irvingtonian provincial\r\nage, therefore, follows the late Blancan provincial age of the early\r\nPleistocene and is succeeded by the Rancholabrean provincial age of\r\nthe late Pleistocene. No specimen of an Irvingtonian _Geomys_ is\r\nreferable to any living species. Two Irvingtonian species have been\r\ndescribed. Hibbard (1944:735) named _Parageomys tobinensis_ [= _Geomys\r\ntobinensis_] from the Tobin local fauna of Russell County, Kansas.\r\nThis species since has been reported from the Cudahy local fauna of\r\nMeade County, Kansas (Paulson, 1961:137). Hibbard (1956:183) also\r\nidentified as _Geomys tobinensis_ the pocket gopher recovered from the\r\nSaunders local fauna, a late Aftonian deposit of Meade County, Kansas,\r\nand reduced the technical name _Parageomys_ from generic to subgeneric\r\nrank. Paulson (_op. cit._:138) pointed out that the Saunders specimens\r\ndiffer from _G. tobinensis_, and he, therefore, restricted the name\r\nto the small _Geomys_ of the Cudahy and Tobin local faunas of\r\nIrvingtonian provincial age. _G. tobinensis_ is markedly smaller than\r\nthe Blancan _G. quinni_. The Cudahy and Tobin local faunas are of\r\napproximately the same age, and presently both are included in one\r\nunit, the Cudahy fauna. The Cudahy fauna is considered to have been\r\ndeposited in late Kansan as it occurs in strata immediately below the\r\nPearlette ash.\r\n\r\nRecently, White and Downs (1961:8) described a new Irvingtonian\r\nspecies, _Geomys garbanii_, from the middle Pleistocene Vallecito\r\nCreek local fauna of San Diego County, California. Many well preserved\r\nfossils of the new species were recovered. _Geomys garbanii_ is of\r\nmedium size (approximately the size of one of the larger subspecies of\r\n_G. bursarius_), and significantly larger than the Irvingtonian\r\n_Geomys tobinensis_ of the Great Plains. The Vallecito Creek\r\noccurrence of _Geomys_ is the first authenticated record from the\r\nPacific Coast region. Matthew (1902:320) erroneously referred remains\r\nof _Thomomys_ to the genus _Geomys_ in his revised list of Cope's\r\nearlier report on the Fossil Lake (or Silver Lake) fauna (see\r\ndiscussion of _Thomomys_ above).\r\n\r\nA number of Irvingtonian fossil remains of _Geomys_ have not been\r\nidentified with particular species. Hibbard (1941a:206) found _Geomys_\r\nin the Borchers local fauna (deposited in the time of the Yarmouthian\r\ninterglacial) of Meade County, Kansas. Also, _Geomys_ has been\r\nreported from several sites in Nebraska. Schultz and Tanner (1957:67)\r\nreported _Geomys_ from the Angus fossil quarry in Nuckolls County,\r\nsouth-central Nebraska. The Angus fossils were found in sediments\r\nof the Sappa Formation considered by Schultz and Tanner to be a\r\nYarmouthian deposit. Fossil quarries (Hay Springs, Rushville, and\r\nGordon) along the south side of the Niobrara River Valley in Sheridan\r\nCounty, Nebraska, have also provided records of geomyids. Both a large\r\nand small species of _Geomys_ have been reported from the more\r\nrecently excavated Rushville and Gordon sites (Schultz and Stout,\r\n1948:562-567, and table 3). In view of the great disparity in size\r\nowing to sex, these may actually be males and females of the same\r\nspecies, as mentioned above. The name Hay Springs has been used in\r\nreference to all three sites. The ages of the Hay Springs sites are\r\napproximately the same, but their correlation is presently under\r\ndebate. Schultz and Tanner (1957:68-71) maintain that the fossils are\r\ndistinctly middle Pleistocene, and that they were deposited during\r\nlate Kansan glaciation, or perhaps from early Yarmouthian into early\r\nIllinoian, with the largest concentration coming from the Sappa sands\r\nof pre-Illinoian (Yarmouth) age. Hibbard (1958:25), basing his opinion\r\non the presence of _Microtus pennsylvanicus_, and the stage of\r\nevolution of other species in the assemblage, regards the Hay Springs\r\nsites as probably Illinoian deposits, but certainly no older than\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nMooser (1959:413) identified as _Geomys_ the pocket gopher from\r\nIrvingtonian deposits in Arroyo San Francisco (loc. no. 5) near the\r\ncity of Aguascalientes, México. As suggested elsewhere in this\r\naccount, these fossils may be referable to _Zygogeomys_ rather\r\nthan _Geomys_. The Irvingtonian provincial age of this fauna was\r\nestablished by Hibbard and Mooser (1963:245-250). Other alleged\r\noccurrences have recently been compiled by Alvarez (1965:19-20).\r\nMaldonado-Koerdell (1948:20) noted four fossil occurrences of the\r\ngenus _Geomys_ in México. Two of these from San Josecito Cave in\r\nNuevo León have since been identified with the genera _Orthogeomys_\r\nand _Pappogeomys_ (Russell, 1960:543-548); the third listed by\r\nMaldonado-Koerdell from \"near Ameca, Jalisco,\" was based on Brown's\r\n(1912:167) mention of some bones supposedly of the family \"Geomyidae,\"\r\nand the fourth refers to pocket gopher remains from the \"Hochtals von\r\nMexiko\" listed as _Geomys_ by Freudenberg (1921:139). His generic\r\nidentification is doubtful and the specimens should be compared with\r\nMexican genera of the Geomyinae.\r\n\r\nUpper Pleistocene records of _Geomys_ also are common. Upper\r\nPleistocene is here understood to include late Illinoian,\r\nSangamon and Wisconsin deposits; all are considered to be of\r\nRancholabrean provincial age (see Hibbard _et al._, 1965:512-515) and\r\npost-Irvingtonian. The presence of remains of _Bison_ and/or _Microtus\r\npennsylvanicus_ are currently considered mammalian index fossils of\r\nRancholabrean faunas. In the Illinoian, _Geomys_ extended its range to\r\nthe Atlantic Coast in the southeastern United States. The eastern and\r\nwestern species-groups evidently were isolated throughout much of the\r\nlate Pleistocene, and, therefore, evolved separately. Of the two, the\r\neastern, or _pinetis_, species-group seems to have remained somewhat\r\nmore generalized, and the western, or _bursarius_, species-group has\r\nbecome more specialized. The Rancholabrean _Geomys_ from deposits in\r\nthe southeastern United States are referable (see Ray, 1963:325) to\r\n_Geomys pinetis_.\r\n\r\nMarsh (1871:121) described _Geomys bisulcatus_ from the North Prong of\r\nthe Loup River (near Camp Thomas), Nebraska. These beds are also\r\ntermed the Loup Fork or Loup River fossil beds (see discussion on p.\r\n485), and they lie along the upper reaches of the Middle Loup River\r\nin Thomas County (near Senea), Hooker County (near Mullen), and\r\nsoutheastern Cherry County (probably the North Prong beds northwest\r\nof Mullen). These beds were at first thought to be of Miocene age,\r\nbut later were regarded as early Pliocene (see Schultz and Stout,\r\n1948:562-566 for a historical account of expeditions to these fossil\r\nsites). Schultz and Tanner (1957:71-72) pointed out that the principal\r\nfossiliferous beds in the Middle Loup region are of middle to late\r\nPleistocene age, with most of the fossils coming from the Crete sand\r\nand silt beds which are probably early Illinoian deposits, and,\r\ntherefore, younger than the Hay Springs faunas. Some fossils may have\r\ncome from the Sappa deposits dated by Schultz and Tanner (_loc. cit._)\r\nas mostly Yarmouthian deposits. _Geomys bisulcatus_, judging from\r\nthe original description and Hibbard's discussion of the cotypes\r\n(1954:357), does not differ significantly from _Geomys bursarius_.\r\nHowever, _Geomys bisulcatus_ is tentatively retained as a valid\r\nspecies. Based on the evidence cited above it seems unlikely that\r\n_Geomys bisulcatus_ occurred in pre-Irvingtonian times as often\r\nsuggested in the literature.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Geomys_ has been identified in several faunas of Illinoian\r\nage, all from the Great Plains. Stephens (1960:1961) reported the\r\ngenus from the Doby Springs local fauna in Harper County, Oklahoma,\r\nand Starrett (1956:1188) reported it from the Berends local fauna in\r\nBeaver County, Oklahoma. Schultz (1965:249) assigned 21 isolated\r\nteeth, including six incisors, from Butler Springs local fauna\r\n(considered by him to be late Illinoian, following the glacial\r\nmaximum) to _Geomys_ cf. _bursarius_. Hibbard and Taylor (1960:167)\r\nreported a baculum tentatively identified as that of _Geomys_ from the\r\nearly Illinoian Butler Springs local fauna (including the Adams fauna)\r\nof Meade County, Kansas. Hibbard (1963:206) recorded the genus\r\n_Geomys_ from the Mt. Scott local fauna (late Illinoian deposits) of\r\nMeade County, Kansas; the specimens probably are referable to the\r\nliving species _bursarius_. From McPherson County, Kansas, Hibbard\r\n(1952:7) reported the genus _Geomys_ from the Kentuck Assemblage,\r\nwhich he (1958:25) regarded as a composite of Illinoian and Sangamon\r\nspecies. Specific identification of the Illinoian pocket gophers is\r\nuncertain, primarily due to the fragmentary nature of the material. On\r\nthe basis of dental characters alone most specimens could be referred\r\nto _G. bursarius_; however the taxonomic status of _G. bisulcatus_\r\nis in doubt, and more complete material may indicate that the\r\nIllinoian gophers are specifically distinct from the living species.\r\nConsequently, most authors, including myself, have made no attempt to\r\nrefer these specimens to species. Nevertheless, the Illinoian _Geomys_\r\nfrom the Great Plains is more closely allied to the living species of\r\n_Geomys_ than it is to the earlier Irvingtonian species.\r\n\r\n_Geomys bursarius_ has been collected from a number of Sangamon fossil\r\nsites on the Great Plains. Although specific identification of\r\nspecimens of _Geomys_ from Illinoian faunas is uncertain, the Great\r\nPlains _Geomys_ from Sangamon and later deposits probably is referable\r\nto the living species as Hibbard and Taylor (1960:165) pointed out.\r\nThey found no difference between _Geomys_ recovered from the Cragin\r\nQuarry local fauna (early Sangamon) of Meade County, Kansas, and the\r\nliving species _Geomys bursarius_. Isolated teeth of the same species\r\nwere collected from the Jinglebob local fauna of Meade County, Kansas\r\n(Hibbard, 1955b:206), a fauna of the late Sangamon. Hibbard (1943:240)\r\nalso recorded the genus _Geomys_ (referable to _G. bursarius_) from\r\nthe Rezabek local fauna of Lincoln County, Kansas. According to\r\nSchultz _et al._ (1951:6 and table 1) the genus _Geomys_ occurs\r\nin buried or \"fossil\" soils of Sangamon age, lying just above the\r\nLoveland Loess, in Nebraska. No specific localities were given by\r\nthem, nor were any particular specimens mentioned. Dalquest reported\r\n_Geomys bursarius_ from two Sangamon faunas in northern Texas. The\r\nspecies is represented in the Ward Quarry local fauna of Cooke County,\r\nTexas (1962a:42), and the Good Creek local fauna of Foard County,\r\nTexas (1962b:575).\r\n\r\n_Geomys bursarius_ has been reported from Wisconsin fossil deposits\r\nof the Great Plains and adjacent areas as follows: Jones local fauna,\r\nMeade County, Kansas (Hibbard and Taylor, 1960:64-66); Two Creeks\r\nForest beds of the third interstadial soils formed between Cary and\r\nMankato glaciations, late Wisconsin (Schultz _et al._, 1951:8 and\r\ntable 1); Cita Canyon local fauna in the northern part of the\r\nPanhandle of Texas (Johnson and Savage, 1955:39); Howard Ranch local\r\nfauna of Hardeman County in northwestern Texas (Dalquest, 1965:70);\r\nQuitaque local fauna of Motley County, Texas (Dalquest, 1964:501);\r\nClear Creek local fauna of Denton County in north-central Texas\r\n(Slaughter and Ritchie, 1963:120); Ben Franklin local fauna, of late\r\nWisconsin beds along the North Sulphur River in Delta County, NE Texas\r\n(Slaughter and Hoover, 1963:137); Bulverde Cave (Hay, 1920:140;\r\n1924:247) and Friesenhahn Cave (Tamsitt, 1957:321), both in Bexar\r\nCounty, south-central Texas; Alton, Illinois (Hay, 1923:338-339);\r\nWisconsin drift of Illinois, without mention of specific locality\r\n(Bader and Techter, 1959:172); Wisconsin drift of southwestern\r\nWisconsin and northeastern Iowa (Hay, _op. cit._:343); Wisconsin drift\r\nnear Galena, Illinois, and mouth of Platte River in eastern Nebraska\r\n(Leidy, 1869:406).\r\n\r\nBrown (1908:194) described _Geomys parvidens_ from the Conard Fissure,\r\nin northern Arkansas. Hibbard (1958:25) concluded that the Conard\r\nFissure fauna represents a glacial stage, probably the Illinoian, and\r\nHibbard _et al._ (1965:510-511) regarded the fauna as a composite\r\nincluding both Irvingtonian and Rancholabrean elements. White and\r\nDowns (1961:21) considered _G. parvidens_ to be a subspecies of\r\n_Geomys bursarius_.\r\n\r\nThe first Pleistocene occurrence of _Geomys_ in the southeastern\r\nUnited States is from the Reddick I deposits reported by Gut and Ray\r\n(1963:325), who found the remains of _Geomys pinetis_ among the\r\nfossils comprising the \"rodent beds\" of Marion County, Florida. Gut\r\nand Ray tentatively identified the beds as Illinoian, but Kurten\r\n(1965:219) regarded the Reddick I fauna as early Sangamon. Simpson\r\n(1928:2) reported _Geomys floridanus_ [= _pinetis_] from Saber-tooth\r\nCave deposits of Citrus County, Florida. The Saber-tooth Cave (or\r\nLecanto Cave) local fauna is considered by Kurten (_op. cit._:219)\r\nalso to be a Sangamon deposit. _Geomys floridanus_ [= _pinetis_] was\r\nreported from the Seminole Field deposits by Simpson (1929:563); both\r\nSimpson and Kurten (_op. cit._:221) agreed that the Seminole Field\r\nfauna is mainly late Wisconsin, although sub-Recent fossils occur at\r\nthe tops of the beds. Ray (1958:430) collected remains of _Geomys\r\npinetis_ from the Melbourne Bone Bed of Brevard County, Florida. The\r\nMelbourne local fauna is considered to be from Wisconsin deposits by\r\nKurten (_op. cit._:220). The eastern species of _Geomys_ were probably\r\nderived from Great Plains stock that reached the southeastern Coastal\r\nPlains in early Rancholabrean (Illinoian) time. Presently there is no\r\ncontact between the eastern and western populations of the genus, and\r\nit is assumed that disjunction occurred as a result of Wisconsin\r\nglaciation. It is interesting to note that the genus _Thomomys_\r\noccurred in this region at approximately the same time; both genera\r\noccur in Saber-tooth Cave deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pappogeomys_\r\n\r\nThe genus _Pappogeomys_ is not known from Pleistocene deposits older\r\nthan the Wisconsin glaciation, but a pre-Pleistocene occurrence in the\r\nBenson beds of Arizona (see discussion of the Pliocene above) shows\r\nthat _Pappogeomys_ had been differentiated by late Pliocene time.\r\nThe absence of _Pappogeomys_, beginning in the early Pleistocene and\r\ncontinuing well into the late Pleistocene, is attributed to the\r\nsouthern distribution of the genus, where its range probably was\r\ncentered on the Central Plateau of México. The paucity of early and\r\nmiddle Pleistocene deposits from this critical region prevents any\r\ndefinite statements about phyletic development within the genus. All\r\nof the late Pleistocene records pertain to the subgenus _Cratogeomys_\r\n(long in use as a generic name but in the present paper reduced to\r\nsubgeneric rank in the genus _Pappogeomys_). Schultz and Howard\r\n(1935:280) found _Cratogeomys_ [= _Pappogeomys_] _castanops_ in\r\nBurnett Cave in the Guadalupe Mountains of south-central New Mexico.\r\nThe Burnett deposits are probably late Wisconsin (see Schultz and\r\nTanner, 1957:75, for discussion of the age of these deposits based\r\non carbon-14 tests). These writers (_loc. cit._) also referred\r\nthe mandible of a small pocket gopher to the genus _Pappogeomys_\r\n[= subgenus _Pappogeomys_]. However, neither genera nor subgenera of\r\nthe tribe Geomyini can be distinguished on the basis of their inferior\r\ndentitions. Judging from the distribution of the modern geomyines, it\r\nseems unlikely that the subgenus _Pappogeomys_ has occurred beyond its\r\npresent range in the late Pleistocene; therefore the small mandible is\r\nmost likely that of a young individual of _Pappogeomys castanops_.\r\nRussell (1960:543) referred specimens collected at San Josecito Cave\r\nin Nuevo León, México, to the group of small subspecies _Cratogeomys_\r\n[= _Pappogeomys_] _castanops_. Also, Russell (_loc. cit._) identified\r\na rostral fragment as of the genus _Cratogeomys_ [= subgenus\r\n_Cratogeomys_] although the fragment had a combination of features\r\ndifferent than in any named species of the genus; he did not name the\r\nfragment as a new species, preferring to wait for additional material\r\nthat could clarify its taxonomic relationships.\r\n\r\nHibbard (1955a:52-53) identified _Cratogeomys_ [= _Pappogeomys_]\r\n_tylorhinus_ from the Becerra Superior deposits in the valley of\r\nTequixquic in the northern part of the state of México. The Wisconsin\r\nage of these beds suggests an earlier Pleistocene derivation of the\r\n_gymnurus_-group of species.\r\n\r\nSeveral specimens of the subgenus _Cratogeomys_ have been reported\r\nfrom beds of latest Wisconsin (certainly after the glacial maximum)\r\nor post-Wisconsin age. Gilmore (1947:158) found fossil remains of\r\n_Cratogeomys_ [= _Pappogeomys_] _castanops_ commonly in Quaternary\r\ncave deposits on the mountain slopes in the vicinity of Cuatro\r\nCiénegas, in central Coahuila. These deposits actually may be of\r\npost-Wisconsin origin (see discussion above). Alvarez (1964:8)\r\nobtained fragments of _Cratogeomys_ [= _Pappogeomys_] _tylorhinus_\r\nfrom sub-Recent deposits of Capa III in the Cueva La Nopalera in\r\nsouthwestern Hidalgo, México. _Pappogeomys merriami_ lives in the\r\narea today. Mayer-Oakes (1959:373) reported remains of _Cratogeomys_\r\n[= _Pappogeomys_] _merriami_ from levels eight and eleven of the\r\nexcavations at El Risco II, in the northern part of Mexico City. The\r\nages of these deposits are unknown to me, but they probably are no\r\nolder than late Wisconsin with most of the beds dating from the\r\npost-Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Orthogeomys_\r\n\r\nThis genus is not known from the Pleistocene, except for its\r\noccurrence in the San Josecito cave deposits of southwestern Nuevo\r\nLeón, México (Russell, 1960:544). Although _Orthogeomys_ does not\r\noccur in the immediate vicinity of the cave at the present time, the\r\nnorthern limits of its range is nearby in southern Tamaulipas. The\r\n_Orthogeomys_ from San Josecito Cave differs from living species,\r\nand has been named _Heterogeomys_ [= _Orthogeomys_] _onerosus_\r\nRussell (_loc. cit._), and is evidently referable to the subgenus\r\n_Heterogeomys_. As mentioned before, the San Josecito Cave local\r\nfauna represents deposits of Wisconsin glaciation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF CLASSIFICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe account of the Tucan or Indian mole by Hernandez (sometimes listed\r\nas Fernandez) in 1651 probably is the earliest published one of a\r\ngeomyid (see Merriam, 1895:201; Coues, 1877:607-608). Linnaeus in 1758\r\ndid not mention geomyids. In 1772, Kerr described Hernandez's Tucan\r\nunder the name _Sorex mexicana_ on the basis of Hernandez's account\r\nwithout having seen any specimens. Lichtenstein in 1827 applied the\r\ntechnical name _Ascomys mexicana_ to three specimens collected by\r\nDeppe from unknown localities on the tableland of México. Merriam\r\n(_loc. cit._) pointed out that the name _mexicanus_ of Lichtenstein in\r\n1827 is a _nomen nudum_, and that it is preoccupied by _mexicanus_\r\nused by Kerr in 1792. The latter can not be technically identified\r\nwith any particular species of geomyid.\r\n\r\nBartram in 1791 wrote of the pocket gopher of Florida, without\r\nformally describing it. The first available technical name is _Mus\r\nbursarius_ of Shaw in 1800. Rafinesque in 1817 proposed the first\r\ngeneric names for the geomyids when he described _Geomys_ and\r\n_Diplostoma_. In 1839, Waterhouse referred the genus _Geomys_ to his\r\nfamily Arvicolidae, considered by him to be a subgroup of muroids. In\r\n1841, he suggested that _Geomys_ was related to _Bathyergus_ and\r\n_Spalax_. Waterhouse in 1848 (p. 8) treated the pocket gophers as a\r\nsubgroup of rodents under the group name Saccomyina, in which he\r\nincluded the genera _Heteromys_, _Saccomys_, _Perognathus_, and\r\n_Dipodomys_. Hence, Waterhouse was the first to recognize the\r\nrelationship between the heteromyids and geomyids. In the next year\r\nGervais erected the family Pseudostomidae for a group of specialized\r\nsquirrels to include _Geomys_ and _Thomomys_ and the same genera (at\r\nleast in part) of heteromyids that Waterhouse classified in the\r\n\"family\" Saccomyina.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 the name _Thomomys_ was proposed by Maximilian (Wied-Neuwied).\r\nAll of the generic names previously proposed for pocket gophers were\r\nconsidered by subsequent authors to be synonyms of _Geomys_.\r\n\r\nA third family name, Sciurospalacoides, was proposed by Brandt\r\n(1855:188) who referred _Geomys_ and _Thomomys_ to that family. He\r\nplaced his new family phylogenetically between the family Sciuridae\r\nand the family Spalacoides (a group in which Brandt included the\r\ngenera _Spalax_, _Sipheus_, and _Ellobius_). Brandt took exception\r\nto the classification of Waterhouse (1848), who united the geomyids\r\nand heteromyids in one family. Brandt placed the heteromyid genera\r\nin other groups: _Perognathus_ in the Muridae, and _Macrocolus_\r\n[= _Dipodomys_] in the Macrolini, a subfamily of the family Dipodoides.\r\n\r\nModern classification of the pocket gophers begins with Baird in 1858.\r\nThe important classifications are summarized in Table 1; a few that do\r\nnot depart essentially from those listed have been omitted owing to\r\nlimited space for the tabular arrangement, but are discussed in the\r\nfollowing account.\r\n\r\nBaird probably was strongly influenced by the arrangement proposed by\r\nWaterhouse in 1848, but was opposed to separating geomyids from\r\nheteromyids as was done by Brandt. Baird was convinced of the close\r\nrelationship of the geomyids and heteromyids, and referred both groups\r\nto one family, the Saccomyidae, as Waterhouse had done earlier. In\r\norder to recognize the morphological specializations he used two\r\nsubfamilies, Geomyinae and the Saccomyinae. In the 20 years that\r\nfollowed, some authors followed Brandt and others followed Baird.\r\n\r\nGill, in 1872 (p. 71), proposed a classification essentially like\r\nBaird's of 1858, but Gill raised Baird's subfamilies to the rank\r\nof family (see Table 1). In referring all pocket gophers to the\r\nGeomyidae, Gill used that name as a family term for the first time.\r\nAlso he established the superfamily Saccomyoidea to include his two\r\nfamilies, Geomyidae and Saccomyidae; therefore, the Saccomyoidea was\r\nequivalent to the group Saccomyina of Waterhouse (1848) and the\r\nSaccomyidae of Baird (1858). Coues (1877), in his classic monograph of\r\nthe Geomyidae followed the arrangement proposed by Gill in treating\r\nthe pocket gophers as a family. Alston in 1876 proposed another\r\nclassification based on Baird (1858), with two subfamilies, the\r\nGeomyinae and the Heteromyinae, united together in the family\r\nGeomyidae; thus, he recognized that the genus _Saccomys_ Frédéric\r\nCuvier, 1823, was a synonym of _Heteromys_ Desmarest, 1817, as had\r\nbeen pointed out by Gray (1868:201) and Peters (1874:356). Coues\r\n(1877:487-490) acknowledged the invalidity of the genus _Saccomys_,\r\nbut refused to give up the name in supergeneric classification. Winge,\r\nfirst in 1887 and subsequently in 1924, classified the geomyids and\r\nheteromyids together in the family Saccomyidae as did Baird in 1858,\r\nand like Coues, Winge too ignored the synonymy of _Saccomys_ with\r\n_Heteromys_ and insisted on retaining the technical terms Saccomyidae\r\nand Saccomyini.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Merriam's classic revision of the Recent Geomyidae\r\nin 1895 all the known species of living pocket gophers were referred\r\nto two genera, _Geomys_ and _Thomomys_. Merriam described much new\r\nmaterial, especially from México and Central America, and proposed\r\nseven new genera (see Table 1). His complete and detailed study of the\r\ndentitions and osteology of the skull remains today as the definitive\r\nwork on this subject, and is the point where most studies of the\r\nGeomyidae must begin. His treatment of the Recent genera survived for\r\n52 years without change until Hooper (1946:397) arranged _Platygeomys_\r\nas a synonym of _Cratogeomys_. However, Merriam's genera have been\r\nrecognized in all subsequent classifications except for the current\r\nreview (see Table 1).\r\n\r\nCope described the first known fossil geomyids in 1878, and published\r\nan excellent review of the two genera, _Pleurolicus_ and _Entoptycus_,\r\nin 1884 (pp. 855-870, pl. 64, figs. 1-9). Both genera were recovered\r\nfrom the John Day Miocene deposits of Oregon. Cope did not propose a\r\nnew systematic arrangement of these geomyids, but referred them to the\r\nfamily Saccomyidae and mentioned that the Saccomyidae was equivalent\r\nto the family Geomyidae of Alston. Winge, in 1887, followed Cope in\r\nreferring _Pleurolicus_ and _Entoptycus_ to the Saccomyidae along with\r\nthe living genera _Thomomys_ and _Geomys_. Miller and Gidley (1918),\r\nin their synopsis of the supergeneric groups of rodents, proposed a\r\nnew subfamily, Entoptychinae, to include the divergent Miocene pocket\r\ngophers. Miller and Gidley also revived the old subfamily Geomyinae of\r\nBaird (1858), but restricted its application to the modern pocket\r\ngophers and their immediate ancestors. In 1936, A. E. Wood revised the\r\ntaxa of the subfamily Entoptychinae, and described the first Miocene\r\ngenus, _Dikkomys_, of the Geomyinae. He followed the supergeneric\r\nclassification of Miller and Gidley (1918).\r\n\r\nThe recent classifications of Simpson (1945) and Wood (1955) have\r\ncombined the classifications of Merriam (1895) and Wood (1936). Wood\r\n(1955) brought up to date the list of genera, including those that\r\nwere described after the publication of Simpson's classification\r\n(1945). In Table 1, the list of genera is principally from Simpson\r\n(1945) but generic names used by Wood (1955) are included. This is the\r\ncurrently accepted classification.\r\n\r\nThe new classification proposed in this paper (see Table 1) includes\r\nthree tribes proposed as vertical units; they are intended to stress\r\nthe phyletic trends in the known evolutionary sequences by placing\r\nimmediate ancestors together with their descendants.\r\n\r\n_Pliogeomys_ is placed in the same tribe (Geomyini) as _Zygogeomys_,\r\n_Geomys_, _Orthogeomys_, and _Pappogeomys_. That tribe includes the\r\nmost specialized Geomyinae. _Zygogeomys_, _Geomys_, _Orthogeomys_, and\r\n_Pappogeomys_ are lineages resulting from a Pleistocene radiation in\r\nwhich all the lineages diverged from a common Pliocene ancestor. The\r\nradiation of the Geomyini was well under way by the close of the late\r\nPliocene. Although _Pliogeomys_ may not be the actual ancestor, it\r\nclosely resembles the primitive morphotype.\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.--History of the classification of the Superfamily Geomyoidea\r\n\r\n

included in his family Saccomyidae the \"group\"\r\n       Gymnoptychine and the contained genus _Gymnoptychus_ Cope, 1873,\r\n       which genus currently is placed in the family Eomyidae. The type\r\n       of _Gymnoptychus_ Cope, 1873, is synonymous with _Ischyromys_\r\n       Leidy, 1856, and the valid name for the genus is _Adjidaumo_\r\n       Hay, 1899.\r\n\r\n_Pliosaccomys_, on the other hand, represents the terminal stages of a\r\nlong trend that began with the _Dikkomys_-like Geomyinae of the early\r\nMiocene. In this lineage, the rate of evolution in the dentition and\r\nthe skull was slow; therefore, the differences between early Miocene\r\n(_Dikkomys_) and middle Pliocene (_Pliosaccomys_) are not great and\r\nthe two are united into the tribe Dikkomyini. The Dikkomyini is the\r\nancestral geomyinen trunk from which the modern groups have diverged.\r\n\r\nThe Pliocene ancestor of _Thomomys_ is unknown but probably resembled\r\n_Pliosaccomys_, with which it may have been a contemporary. _Thomomys_\r\nis the least specialized of the modern Geomyinae, and, consequently,\r\nshows the most resemblance to the ancestral tribe. The specializations\r\nof _Thomomys_, however, clearly preclude its reference to the tribe\r\nDikkomyini; therefore, it is set apart in the monotypic tribe\r\nThomomyini. That tribe has not undergone an adaptive radiation\r\ncomparable to that of the tribe Geomyini or that of the Entoptychinae\r\nin the early Miocene. Here, for the first time, _Thomomys_ is set\r\napart in classification from the other living pocket gophers.\r\n\r\nMerriam's genera _Orthogeomys_, _Heterogeomys_, and _Macrogeomys_ are\r\nclosely related. Each of these taxa is retained as a subgenus of a\r\nsingle genus, _Orthogeomys_. Some species of _Macrogeomys_ seem to be\r\nmore closely allied to the subgenus _Orthogeomys_ and others to the\r\nsubgenus _Heterogeomys_. A revision of the genus is needed; it might\r\nshow that the currently recognized subgenera are artificial, and that\r\na different arrangement of the species would more clearly express\r\ntheir evolutionary relationships. The subgenus _Heterogeomys_ seems to\r\nbe the most nearly uniform of the subgenera, and it is the least\r\nspecialized. Radiation within the genus may have begun relatively\r\nrecently, but the many special adaptations for tropical environments\r\nsuggest that the genus has been in the Neotropical Zone a long time.\r\nTherefore, discovery of an early dichotomy from the common ancestral\r\nstock of the tribe would come as no surprise.\r\n\r\n_Nerterogeomys_ Gazin here is arranged as a junior synonym of\r\n_Zygogeomys_. Both are less specialized than any of the other\r\nGeomyini, except _Pliogeomys_. The single living species (_Zygogeomys\r\ntricopus_) is obviously a relic. Its range is small. The two\r\nsubspecies differ only in minor features. The living species does\r\nhave a few unique characteristics, only to be expected in the\r\nsurviving species of a long phyletic lineage. Some of these are\r\nspecializations. Otherwise, _Zygogeomys_ and _Nerterogeomys_ are\r\nclosely related and the latter is best placed as a synonym of the\r\nformer. Both are admittedly closely related to _Geomys_. _Zygogeomys_\r\nand _Geomys_ share several characters, particularly primitive ones;\r\nthere is considerable parallelism, especially marked in Irvingtonian\r\nspecies of _Geomys_. Nevertheless, _Geomys_ is more specialized,\r\nparticularly in the dentition, and it has developed some\r\n_Pappogeomys_-like specializations. _Zygogeomys_ has retained more of\r\nthe primitive characters of the tribe. A strong case could be made for\r\nrecognizing only one genus, _Geomys_, containing _Zygogeomys_ as one\r\nof two subgenera. Nevertheless, the characters separating _Zygogeomys_\r\nand _Geomys_ are of considerable importance and I consider the two\r\nkinds to be distinct genera.\r\n\r\nThe species of _Geomys_, both living and extinct, form a distinct and\r\nwell-marked group. The genus is less primitive in most respects than\r\n_Zygogeomys_ and _Orthogeomys_ and it is less specialized than\r\n_Pappogeomys_, excluding the ancestral stock (subgenus _Pappogeomys_).\r\nSome specimens of species of Irvingtonian age (_Geomys tobinensis_ and\r\n_Geomys garbanii_, especially the former) retain primitive enamel\r\nplates as does _Zygogeomys_; but this is true of only a small\r\npercentage of the individuals. Also the adult dental pattern developed\r\nsomewhat later in ontogeny in these middle Pleistocene species of\r\n_Geomys_ than in either Recent or late Pliocene and early Pleistocene\r\nrepresentatives (_Geomys paenebursarius_, _Geomys quinni_) of the\r\ngenus. Whether these features represent a stage in the evolution of\r\nthe late Pleistocene and Recent species or a terminal stage in members\r\nof a sterile and primitive branch of the main line of evolution of\r\n_Geomys_ is uncertain. At present I favor the latter explanation, and\r\nview _G. paenebursarius_ and _G. quinni_ as early progressive species\r\nthat evolved dental specializations that were maintained in the main\r\nline of phylogeny.\r\n\r\nHibbard proposed the generic name _Parageomys_ (1944:55), but later\r\nregarded it as a subgenus of _Geomys_ (1956:182) that includes those\r\nspecies retaining continuous enamel bands until relatively late in\r\nontogeny; no other differences have been noted. When the early\r\nphylogeny of _Geomys_ is better understood, _Parageomys_ may serve as\r\na subgeneric taxon in which the primitive species of _Geomys_ can be\r\ngrouped, but as of now _Parageomys_ is arranged as a synonym of\r\n_Geomys_.\r\n\r\n_Pappogeomys_ and _Cratogeomys_ also form a natural group. Their close\r\nrelationship is best reflected in formal taxonomy by including them in\r\nthe same genus. Their dissimilarities are of the sort that separate a\r\nprimitive ancestral lineage from a divergent and progressively more\r\nspecialized assemblage. The fossil record is inadequate, and I\r\ncan only speculate that _Cratogeomys_ diverged from primitive\r\n_Pappogeomys_-stock in the earlier Pleistocene, at least before the\r\nend of the Irvingtonian. _Cratogeomys_ probably originated on the\r\nMexican Plateau and probably underwent its subsequent evolution there.\r\nThe living species of the subgenus _Pappogeomys_ are evidently relics\r\nof the ancestral stock of the genus. Hooper (1946:397), I think\r\ncorrectly, considered _Platygeomys_ as congeneric with _Cratogeomys_,\r\nalthough the highest degree of specialization of the genus is attained\r\nin those species formerly classed in the genus _Platygeomys_. Even so,\r\nin my opinion, the differences are insufficient to warrant even\r\nsubgeneric recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily GEOMYIDAE Gill, 1872\r\n\r\nRodents of the superfamily Geomyoidea specialized for completely\r\nfossorial life (early Pliocene to Recent); specialized earlier (late?\r\nOligocene and early Miocene) for semi-fossorial habits; body thickset,\r\nfusiform without apparent neck (in modern geomyids); legs short;\r\nforelegs especially stout; eyes and ears small (pinna reduced to\r\ninconspicuous crest concealed beneath pelage); tail tactile, shorter\r\nthan head and body; lips closing behind incisors; cheek pouches\r\nexternal, fur-lined; baculum rodlike, arched, having expanded\r\nquadriform platelike base; pelage long, soft without underfur,\r\ncovering body in thick coat (in some species of _Orthogeomys_ scant,\r\nharsh or scattered bristles); color varying from pale tints of buffy\r\n(almost white) to metallic black.\r\n\r\nSkull thick-walled, massive, angular, relatively broad, and flattened;\r\ndistinctly murine form, but having zygomasseteric structure of\r\nadvanced sciuromorphs, including small infraorbital canal (that\r\ntransmits no part of masseter muscle) and well-developed, broad\r\nzygomatic plate; zygomata massive and widely flaring, jugals stout;\r\nrostrum robust, relatively broad and deep, and without evidence of\r\ntransverse canal (as in Heteromyidae); anterior projection of nasals\r\nonly slightly exceeding that of upper incisors; interorbital region\r\nusually constricted, narrower than rostrum; anterior opening of\r\ninfraorbital canal far forward on side of rostrum, about half\r\nway between zygomatic plate and upper incisor and just behind\r\npremaxillary-maxillary suture, its opening countersunk in oblique\r\nsulcus (for protection from muscle contraction); postorbital process\r\nlacking, except for rudimentary knoblike projection in subgenus\r\n_Macrogeomys_; palate relatively narrow, its deeply sculptured surface\r\nsloping steeply downward posteriorly causing region supporting\r\nmaxillary tooth-row to be markedly depressed; palatine bone reduced,\r\nforming, on two abruptly different levels, posterior margin of hard\r\npalate behind tooth-rows; parietals compressed and narrow, and most of\r\ncerebral cavity roofed by squamosals (in some species squamosals\r\noverlap lateral parts of parietals); tympanic bullae completely\r\ninferior in position and fully ossified, external meatus being\r\ndeveloped laterally as elongated tube; mastoid not inflated, but\r\nbroadly exposed at posterolateral margin of the skull; occiput large,\r\nits surface usually rugose, and paroccipital processes large and\r\nflangelike, at least in advanced groups (early Pliocene to Recent);\r\nramus relatively short and stout, having distinct crest and ridges\r\nfor muscle attachments; coronoid process well developed, erect;\r\narticular condyle prominent; angular process prominent, reflected\r\nlaterally, and in modern groups lateral extension protruding from\r\nposterior border of ramus nearly at right angle; capsule for root of\r\nlower incisor, prominent between angular process and articular\r\ncondyle.\r\n\r\nAnterior surface of incisors broad and flat, always smooth on lower\r\nteeth, but either smooth or grooved on upper teeth depending on taxon;\r\ncheek teeth hypsodont, becoming progressively higher crowned in modern\r\ngroups, rooted in primitive groups (late?

According to MacDonald (1963:149-150), the\r\nUpper Rosebud is middle Miocene rather than early Miocene.\r\n\r\n_Description._--Size small, about as in small kinds of _Thomomys_;\r\nknown only from fragmentary mandible, including molariform dentition\r\nin place, and isolated cheek teeth, including M1 (see Wood, 1936:26-28\r\nand fig. 32; Galbreath, 1948:316-317 and fig. 1; and Black, 1961:13-14\r\nand fig. 58); upper incisors unknown; cheek teeth hyposodont,\r\npersistently rooted, and having crowns of medium height compared with\r\nRecent geomyids; enamel investment complete and uninterrupted in all\r\nmolariform teeth in all stages of wear; P4 unknown, but probably\r\nformed like p4; p4 persistently biprismatic, two crowns joined at\r\nmid-points by relatively narrow isthmus separating lateral re-entrant\r\nfolds; anterior lophid of p4 having distinct anteroexternal\r\ninflection; molars also biprismatic throughout life; two lophids of\r\nlower molars first uniting at mid-points as in p4, and, with\r\nadditional wear, m1 and m2 secondarily uniting at edge of protomeres\r\nand forming isolated enamel fossette between point of connection\r\n(detailed description of stages of wear discussed in account of\r\nphylogeny of subfamily); m3 permanently joined at mid-point only,\r\nwithout lateral union at edge of protomeres; upper molars, judging by\r\nM1 (M2 and M3 unknown), having same pattern as lower molars, but first\r\nunion of lophs decidedly on lingual side of center, consequently,\r\nlingual re-entrant fold small; M1 probably developing U-pattern in\r\nadvanced stages of wear by union of protomeres, with minute lingual\r\nfossette developing in transition as lophs secondarily become united\r\nat lingual edge of columns; mandible stout and geomyidlike; masseteric\r\nridge weakly developed; basitemporal fossa absent.\r\n\r\nEvidently, _Dikkomys matthewi_ is more primitive than _Dikkomys\r\nwoodi_. The modified H-pattern in m1 and m2, with the metalophid and\r\nhypolophid joined at both their mid-points and also at their\r\nprotomeres (by union of the protostylid and hypostylid in the lower\r\ndentition), is persistent throughout life. Therefore, the enclosed\r\nenamel fossette is not eradicated with wear. In m1 and m2 of _Dikkomys\r\nwoodi_, the fossette is shallower, and, at least in advanced stages of\r\nwear, it would disappear, therefore, forming a U-pattern on the\r\nocclusal surface, as in M1 and M2, but lateral inflection horizontally\r\nshallow rather than deep as in entoptychines.\r\n\r\nSpecimen (No. P 26284 FMNH) reported as _Dikkomys matthewi_ by\r\nGalbreath (1948:316) is referable to the recently described species\r\n_Dikkomys woodi_ Black, 1961.\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--One, no.

Known primarily from western North America from\r\nsouthern Canada south to Central México in Pliocene, Pleistocene and\r\nRecent and in middle and late Pleistocene of Maryland and Florida.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Size small to medium (basilar length exclusive of _T.\r\nbulbivorus_, measuring from approximately 24 to 45, including both\r\nmales and females); upper incisors without grooving, excepting fine,\r\nindistinct sulcus rarely near inner margin (grooving more common in\r\n_T. monticola_ than in other Recent species); crowns of cheek teeth\r\nhigh, rooted and ever-growing; all molars, including M3, monoprismatic\r\nand anteroposteriorly compressed, sometimes (especially in subadults)\r\nhaving slight inflection on labial side in upper teeth and lingual\r\nside in lower teeth; molars bicolumnar in pre-final stages of wear\r\n(seen in juvenal teeth only), patterns of wear in both upper and lower\r\nmolars resembling those of _Pliosaccomys_, except that crowns of m3\r\nand M3 unite into single column in final stages of wear; enamel\r\npattern interrupted in all cheek teeth, loss occurring only at sides\r\nof each column; transverse enamel blade completely covering posterior\r\nface of both P4 and p4; all upper and lower molars with two transverse\r\nenamel blades, one on anterior surface and one on posterior surface,\r\nof each tooth, including M3; small third plate sometimes persistent on\r\nbroad side of tooth, labial side in upper molars and lingual side in\r\nlower molars (_T. bulbivorus_); skull generalized, neither unusually\r\nnarrow and deep or broad and flat; usually without marked cresting or\r\nrugosity; masseteric ridge well developed and massive; basitemporal\r\nfossa absent, sometimes shallow depression forming in _T. townsendii_;\r\npelage soft, never harsh or hispid, covering body with thick coat of\r\nhair; forefoot exceptionally small for fossorial mammal, claws not\r\nespecially long; body form remarkably fossorial.\r\n\r\nThe tribe Thomomyini is monotypic, including only the genus\r\n_Thomomys_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus =Thomomys= Wied-Neuwied\r\n\r\n    1839. _Thomomys_ Wied-Neuwied, Nova Acta Phys.

The latest records are from the fauna of Saber-tooth\r\nCave, Florida, a late Pleistocene assemblage that probably was\r\ndeposited in the Sangamon. The middle and late Pleistocene records are\r\nfrom the eastern United States, suggesting that the subgenus\r\n_Pleisothomomys_ was restricted to that region while the subgenus\r\n_Thomomys_ occupied the western United States and parts of Canada and\r\nMéxico as it does today.\r\n\r\n_Description and Comparison._--Separated from subgenus _Thomomys_ only\r\non basis of sub-crescentic shaped molars (only jaw fragments and\r\nisolated teeth known), seemingly a primitive feature of the genus.\r\nThis dental structure continued into the late Pleistocene; none of the\r\nRecent species expresses this feature of the molars, although the\r\nmolars of _Thomomys vetus_ of the late Pleistocene (Wisconsin\r\ndeposits), referred to the subgenus _Thomomys_ on the basis of\r\nits alleged relationship to _Thomomys townsendii_ (see Davis,\r\n1937:156-158), are less distinctly pear-shaped, and are more\r\nsub-crescentic, than in any other known species of the subgenus\r\n_Thomomys_. _Pleisothomomys_ Gidley and Gazin (_loc. cit._) was\r\nproposed as a genus but is here considered as of no more than\r\nsubgeneric worth, and is recognized because of the apparent constancy\r\nof the sub-crescentic molars in the earlier members of the genus and\r\nin those populations of _Thomomys_ occurring in Pleistocene times in\r\nthe eastern United States.\r\n\r\n_Referred species._--Three (all extinct):\r\n\r\n    *_Thomomys gidleyi_ Wilson, 1933.

Numerous records, mostly isolated teeth, from\r\nnearly all stratigraphic levels of the Pleistocene (for details, see\r\naccount of fossil record).\r\n\r\n_Description._--Molars pear-shaped in cross-section, becoming abruptly\r\nnarrow at one end of the tooth. The teeth of the late Pleistocene\r\nspecies _Thomomys vetus_ are less distinctly pear-shaped than other\r\nreferred species (see remarks in the description of the subgenus\r\n_Pleisothomomys_).\r\n\r\nEssentially on the basis of its significantly larger size and details\r\nof the skull, Elliott (1903:190) proposed subgeneric recognition of\r\n_Thomomys bulbivorus_ and described the subgenus _Megascapheus_ to\r\ninclude it. Also the molars of _Thomomys bulbivorus_ usually have a\r\nsmall enamel plate, both above and below, bordering the persistent\r\ninflection on the protomere end of the tooth; each lateral plate is\r\nisolated from the transverse plates on the anterior and posterior\r\nwalls of the tooth. In my opinion these features do not warrant\r\nsubgeneric recognition; however, these characters do distinctly\r\nseparate _Thomomys bulbivorus_ from other groups of species, and the\r\ncharacter of the molars suggests retention of a primitive trait.\r\nTherefore, I propose that the unique structure of this species be\r\nrecognized by setting it apart in the _bulbivorus_ species-group.\r\n\r\n_Referred species._--Ten species, three extinct, placed in three\r\nspecies-groups (the numerous subspecies of this genus are listed in\r\nMiller and Kellogg, 1955:276-332, and Hall and Kelson, 1959:412-447).\r\n\r\n\r\n_bulbivorus_ species-group\r\n\r\n    _Thomomys bulbivorus_ (Richardson, 1829).

Professor Hibbard informs me (personal\r\ncommunication) that he found the type, a right ramus, lying on the\r\nsurface near the base of the fossil beds. The isolated teeth of small\r\ngeomyids from the Saw Rock Canyon local fauna (see Hibbard, 1953:392)\r\nmay also be referable to this genus. The Saw Rock Canyon local fauna\r\nmay also be middle Pliocene in age but is considered to be from the\r\nlater part of the late Pliocene, and, therefore, somewhat younger than\r\nthe Buis Ranch local fauna (Hibbard, _op. cit._:342).\r\n\r\n_Description and discussion._--The size of members of this small genus\r\nof the Geomyinae is about the same as in smaller adults of _Geomys\r\nbursarius_. According to Hibbard (_op. cit._:353), the holotype is\r\nsmaller than specimens from the Rexroad local fauna referred to\r\n_Geomys quinni_ and larger than specimens referred to _Zygogeomys_ cf.\r\n_minor_. The cheek teeth are rooted, and the crowns are as high as\r\nthose of living geomyids. The upper incisor is bisulcate, and the\r\ninner groove is fine and indistinct in places.\r\n\r\nOf the molariform dentition only the lower premolar and first two\r\nlower molars are known. The enamel investment of p4 is complete, and\r\nwould not be subject to interruption at any stage of wear; the two\r\nprisms are joined at their mid-points, and the isthmus of dentine is\r\nrelatively broad (as in _Pliosaccomys_) when compared with modern\r\npocket gophers of this tribe. Also, the re-entrant folds, rather than\r\nhaving parallel sides, diverge broadly to the sides. The divergence is\r\nespecially noticeable in the labial fold. The lower deciduous premolar\r\nwould have formed essentially the same enamel pattern with wear as\r\nobserved in _Nerterogeomys_ [= _Zygogeomys_] cf. _minor_ (see Hibbard,\r\n1954:fig. 5, A and B) and _Pliosaccomys dubius_ (see Wilson, 1936; pl.\r\n1, fig. 1). Each molar is a single column in the final stages of wear;\r\npre-final stages are unknown. Anterior and posterior enamel plates are\r\npresent on m1 and m2 (m3 has not been recovered). The dentine tracts\r\nof m1 are exposed over a relatively wide surface; therefore, the\r\nenamel plates are distinctly separated. The tracts of dentine of m2\r\nare much narrower than in m1 and the enamel plates are barely\r\nseparated at the anterolateral margin of the tooth. Possibly the\r\nenamel band of m2 was continuous in an earlier stage of wear.\r\n\r\nThe mandible is stout and its general construction not unlike that in\r\nmodern geomyines. The capsule at the base of the angular process that\r\nreceives the terminal end of the lower incisor is well developed. The\r\nbase of the angular processes is preserved, and suggests that the\r\nprocess was short and decidedly smaller than in living examples of the\r\ntribe. The masseteric ridge is distinct but weakly developed, and not\r\nat all massive as in living pocket gophers. The mental foramen is\r\nimmediately anterior, and slightly ventral, to the anterior extension\r\nof the crest. The basitemporal fossa is absent as such, but its\r\nposition is marked by a slight depression.\r\n\r\n_Specimens examined._--Two rami; nos. 29147 (holotype) and 33446;\r\nseveral isolated teeth 30194 and 30195, including an upper incisor and\r\na dp4 (deciduous lower premolar), all from Univ.

This genus is distinguished principally by the\r\nretention of primitive features. In the living species, the skull is\r\ngeneralized, rather than specialized toward either extreme\r\ndolichocephaly or platycephaly. The angular process is short, barely\r\nexceeding the lateral extensions of the mastoid process of the\r\nsquamosal. The rostrum is remarkably narrow in relation to its length.\r\nThe jugal is reduced and displaced ventrally, causing the maxillary\r\narm of the zygomata to articulate with the squamosal arm of the\r\nzygomata along the dorsal border of the zygomatic arch (a feature\r\nobserved also in _Orthogeomys cherriei costaricensis_).\r\n\r\nThe upper incisor, recovered in material from the late Pliocene and\r\nmiddle Pleistocene, is bisulcate as in the genus _Geomys_ and the\r\nprimitive genus _Pliogeomys_. The enamel plate across the posterior\r\nwall of P4 is either complete (late Pliocene to late Pleistocene) or\r\nrestricted to the lingual half of the tooth (always restricted in\r\nliving species). The Pliocene specimens of the Rexroad local fauna\r\nreferred to _Nerterogeomys_ cf. _minor_ by Hibbard (1950:138-139) are\r\nexceptional. In these specimens the length and position of the\r\nposterior enamel plate is variable; however, all but one specimen had\r\npersistant enamel. Evidently, in approximately 43 per cent of the\r\nspecimens, a complete enamel blade was present (see Paulson,\r\n1961:139), and in the others (except the one without any enamel) the\r\nplate was restricted to a small area of the ventral surface, usually\r\non the lingual side of the loph. Hibbard suggested that the decrease\r\nin size of the plate, and its restriction to the lingual side, may be\r\na function of age. Hence, most adults would be characterized by the\r\nreduced posterior plate on the upper premolar. Although age may be the\r\nimportant factor, intragroup variation cannot be ruled out. It is of\r\ninterest to note that in all specimens from the Benson (type series of\r\n_P. minor_) and Curtis Ranch local faunas, the former of late Pliocene\r\nage and the latter of middle Pleistocene age, the enamel plates are\r\ncomplete on the posterior face of the upper premolar. As mentioned\r\nbefore, the specimens from Kansas may actually represent the\r\ntransitional stages of the early evolution of _Geomys_ in which the\r\nposterior plate of P4 is entirely lost. The enamel pattern of p4 is\r\nlike that in other members of the tribe (excepting the genus\r\n_Pliogeomys_). The re-entrant angles of P4 and p4 are widely open\r\n(obtuse) in the examples recovered from late Pliocene and middle\r\nPleistocene deposits, representing retention of a trait that is\r\nprimitive in the Geomyini (see account of phylogeny).\r\n\r\nM1 and M2 are elliptical in cross-section and each has an enamel plate\r\non both the anterior and posterior surface. In the living species (_Z.\r\ntrichopus_), the posterior enamel plate fails to reach the labial\r\nmargin of the tooth and is restricted to the lingual two-thirds of the\r\nposterior surface; however, the enamel plates are complete in the late\r\nPliocene species (_Z. minor_) and the middle Pleistocene species (_Z.\r\npersimilis_), being only slightly separated from the anterior plate by\r\nnarrow tracts of dentine on the ends of the tooth. M3 is partly\r\nbiprismatic in the living species, the two incompletely divided lophs\r\nbeing separated by a distinct outer sulcus. The posterior loph is\r\nelongated and forms a conspicuous heel paralleling the evolution of\r\nthis trait in the genus _Orthogeomys_; therefore, the crown is longer\r\nthan wide. The posterior part of the tooth is protected by two lateral\r\nenamel plates; of the two, the lingual plate is especially long and\r\nextends to the end of the heel. M3 has not been recovered in the\r\nPliocene species, but in the middle Pleistocene species (_Z.\r\npersimilis_) M3 is subtriangular, no longer than wide, and the lateral\r\ninflections are weakly developed. The trend towards elongation of M3\r\nevidently occurred in late Pleistocene evolution of the genus. All\r\nthree of the inferior molars are elliptical, and only the posterior\r\nenamel plate is present (as in all other genera of the tribe except\r\n_Pliogeomys_).\r\n\r\nThe masseteric ridge of the mandible is well developed. In the late\r\nPliocene species _Z. persimilis_ and _Z. minor_ the mental foramen is\r\ndirectly beneath the anterior extension of the masseteric ridge, but\r\nin the living species, _Z. trichopus_, the foramen lies well anterior\r\nto the ridge. The basitemporal fossa in the living species is well\r\ndeveloped and deep; in the Pliocene species it is usually distinct but\r\nshallow (late Pliocene specimens of _Z. minor_).\r\n\r\n_Referred species._--Three (two extinct and one living; the last has\r\ntwo subspecies):\r\n\r\n    *_Zygogeomys minor_ (Gidley), 1922.

Reported\r\nfrom numerous Pleistocene deposits of all stratigraphic levels,\r\nespecially from the Great Plains, where common today.\r\n\r\n_Description and discussion._--Pocket gophers of this genus are\r\nmedium-sized geomyids; none is so small as the average-sized\r\n_Thomomys_. The skull is generalized and lacks the dolichocephalic and\r\nplatycephalic specializations seen in the genera _Orthogeomys_ and\r\n_Pappogeomys_, respectively. _Geomys_ closely resembles _Zygogeomys_,\r\nbut retains fewer of the primitive characters of the ancestral stock.\r\nAt the same time, _Geomys_ has several specializations. Even so, a\r\nconsiderable amount of parallelism is evident in the phyletic trends\r\nof the two genera.\r\n\r\nThe upper incisor of _Geomys_ is bisulcate as in _Pliogeomys_ and\r\n_Zygogeomys_; the deeper grove is medial and the shallower grove lies\r\nnear the inner border of the tooth. The premolar, above and below, is\r\nbicolumnar; and two columns are joined at their mid-points (deep\r\nre-entrant angles separate the columns at the sides). A permanent\r\nenamel plate protects the anterior face of the anterior loph, and\r\nenamel bands outline each of the re-entrant folds. In p4 a complete\r\nenamel plate covers the posterior surface of the posterior loph. All\r\nof the enamel bands are interrupted by tracts of dentine, except in\r\nthe initial stages of wear of the occlusal surface of the newly\r\nerupted tooth. For a short time in living _Geomys_, the enamel bands\r\nare continuous as observed in juveniles of _Geomys bursarius major_\r\n(KU 5628, 8531, and 41540). But, the enamel cap is thin and the\r\ndentine tracts, which are high on the sides of the tooth, are soon\r\nrevealed by a minimum of wear on the crown. Therefore, the adult, or\r\nfinal, pattern characterized by interrupted enamel plates emerges\r\nearly in life and remains throughout the life of the individual.\r\nEvidence from fossil _Geomys_, especially from specimens from early\r\nand late Pleistocene deposits, suggests that the final adult pattern\r\nappears later, ontogenetically, than in Recent specimens. Some of the\r\nfossil premolars in initial stages of wear have continuous and\r\nuninterrupted bands of enamel. _Geomys quinni_ of the late Pliocene\r\nand early Pleistocene has the interrupted pattern seen in late\r\nPleistocene and Recent _Geomys_. Also, in late Pliocene and early\r\nPleistocene species, the re-entrant folds diverge laterally and form\r\n\"open\" angles. In later taxa (middle Pleistocene to Recent) the folds\r\nare compressed and parallel-sided, and the \"open\" folds are found only\r\nin the early stages of wear.\r\n\r\nThe posterior enamel plate of P4 disappears in the final stages of\r\nwear as the interrupted enamel pattern is formed. In the late\r\nPleistocene and Recent _Geomys_, the loss of the posterior plate\r\noccurs early in life, usually in the first phases of wear on the\r\nocclusal surface of the newly erupted tooth, but in fossils of\r\n_Geomys_ of corresponding ontogenetic age from the early and middle\r\nPleistocene, the posterior plate is retained in some individuals until\r\na later phase of wear, thereby delaying the appearance of the final\r\npattern. Indeed, in five or fewer per cent of the individuals (see\r\nPaulson, 1961:138-139; and White and Downs, 1961:18) a vestige of\r\nenamel is retained throughout life or at least until late in\r\nadulthood. In _Geomys tobinensis_, for example, a thin, but\r\ntransversely complete, plate of enamel occurs all the way down to the\r\nbase of the loph (Paulson, _loc. cit._) and would persist throughout\r\nlife. In _Geomys garbanii_, a vestige on the lingual side of the\r\nposterior surface of a fully adult specimen was noted by White and\r\nDowns (_loc. cit._). Vestiges of the posterior plate occur less\r\nfrequently in living geomyids. Paulson (_loc. cit._) found a posterior\r\nplate in one of 75 specimens of _Geomys bursarius dutcheri_. A young\r\n(suture present between exoccipitals and supraoccipital) female of\r\n_Geomys pinetis austrinus_ (KU 23358) has a vestige of the posterior\r\nplate on the lingual side of the tooth as White and Downs (_loc.\r\ncit._) observed in a specimen of _Geomys garbanii_. The enamel, I\r\nsuspect, tends to be thicker on the lingual than on the labial side of\r\nthe loph and extends farther down the lingual surface in some\r\nindividuals; therefore, wear on the occlusal surface erodes it down to\r\nthe dentine more rapidly on the labial than on the lingual side. The\r\ntendency of enamel to be retained is a primitive feature.\r\n\r\nA lower molar of _Geomys_ is a single elliptical column, and enamel is\r\nrestricted to the posterior surface as in _Zygogeomys_, _Orthogeomys_,\r\nand _Pappogeomys_. Paulson (_loc. cit._) found a thin enamel plate on\r\nthe anterior surfaces of the lower molars in about five per cent of\r\nthe individuals of _Geomys tobinensis_ from the Cudahy local fauna\r\n(middle Pleistocene, deposits of the late Kansan glaciation). An\r\nanterior plate is unknown in other members of the tribe Geomyini,\r\nexcept in the primitive genus _Pliogeomys_ of the middle Pliocene.\r\nOccurrence of the plate in _Geomys tobinensis_ is an atavistic trait.\r\nPrimitive dental patterns occur occasionally in geomyids, as pointed\r\nout above, but the frequency of occurrence in _G. tobinensis_ is\r\nhigher than would be expected.\r\n\r\nM1 and M2, like the lower molars, are elliptical in cross-section.\r\nComplete enamel plates on the anterior and posterior surfaces are\r\nseparated by tracts of dentine on the sides of each tooth. M3 is\r\nusually suborbicular (sometimes subtriangular) in cross-section. The\r\ntooth is not especially elongated posteriorly and usually has no\r\ndefinite heel; therefore, it is not significantly longer than wide.\r\nLiving species of _Geomys_ rarely have a well defined outer re-entrant\r\nfold on M3; less than 10 per cent of the individuals (and usually only\r\none side in each individual in which it occurs) have it, although a\r\nshallow inconspicuous groove occurs more frequently. The biprismatic\r\nmolar characteristic of the ancestral morphotype is less often found\r\nin _Geomys_ than in any other living member of the tribe Geomyini. The\r\nouter re-entrant fold and biprismatic pattern are more often present\r\nin the extinct species _Geomys garbanii_ of the Middle Pleistocene\r\nthan in other species. Less than 24 per cent of the third upper molars\r\nin _Geomys garbanii_ lack a tract of the re-entrant fold and more than\r\n38 per cent have a well developed outer fold (see White and Downs,\r\n1961:13, 18). The bicolumnar pattern, although incomplete, would be\r\nclearly evident in those teeth having a well marked re-entrant fold;\r\nthe pattern occurs less frequently in those teeth with no fold or only\r\na slight one. M3 of geomyids is not usually recovered and, therefore,\r\nthe occlusal pattern of M3 is unknown in most extinct kinds of\r\n_Geomys_. In Recent _Geomys_ the fold is more common in the eastern\r\n_pinetis_ species-group than in the western _bursarius_ species-group.\r\n\r\nThe masseteric ridge on the outer side of the mandible is well\r\ndeveloped in all species of the genus. The position of the mental\r\nforamen relative to the anterior part of the ridge varies with\r\nindividuals and according to species. The basitemporal fossa is always\r\npresent, but is shallower in the late Pliocene and Pleistocene species\r\nthan in Recent species. The angular process is short.\r\n\r\n_Referred species._--The twelve species, five of which are extinct,\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n_quinni_ species-group\r\n\r\n    *_Geomys quinni_ McGrew, 1944.

The skull is strongly dolichocephalic in most species;\r\nthe posterior part of the skull is especially narrow. The angular\r\nprocesses are remarkably short, especially in relation to the length\r\nof the mandible. The nasals and rostrum are relatively broad and\r\nheavy. The pelage is coarse, and often hispid. In some species the\r\nhairs are so sparsely distributed that the body appears almost naked,\r\nand none has so dense a covering of hair as do other genera. The genus\r\noccurs entirely within the tropical life-zones, and most of the\r\nexternal features seem to be associated with adaptation to tropical\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe upper incisor is unisulcate; the sulcus is usually near the inner\r\nborder of the tooth, but in some species (subgenus _Orthogeomys_) it\r\nis more medial, and in a few individuals with an extremely wide groove\r\nthe outer lip of the sulcus may actually reach the middle of the\r\ntooth. The groove is compressed or open. The premolar is a double\r\ncolumn united at the mid-point. The two prisms are of approximately\r\nequal size, and the lateral re-entrant folds are so compressed that\r\ntheir sides are parallel. Enamel plates cover the anterior surface and\r\nborder the re-entrant angles in both upper and lower premolars. As in\r\nother members of the tribe, the lower premolar has a fourth enamel\r\nplate on the posterior surface of the posterior lophid. In the upper\r\npremolar, the enamel plate is reduced to a narrow blade on the lingual\r\nside of the loph as in the living species of the genus _Zygogeomys_.\r\nIn the subgenus _Orthogeomys_ the posterior plate is usually absent,\r\nand otherwise is narrow and near the lingual border of the tooth.\r\n\r\nEach lower molar, in the final stage of wear, consists of a single\r\nelliptical column having an enamel plate only on the posterior\r\nsurface. The first and second upper molars are single elliptical\r\ncolumns having one enamel plate on the anterior surface and another\r\non the posterior surface. The plates are separated by a tract of\r\ndentine on each side of the tooth. The third upper molar is partly\r\nbilophodont, and the two lophs are separated by a deep outer\r\nre-entrant fold. In many of the species an inner re-entrant fold also\r\nis retained, but in the adult tooth it is less distinct than the\r\nouter. In all of the species the posterior loph is long and forms a\r\nconspicuous heel; consequently the crown is significantly longer then\r\nwide. Moreover, the posterior loph has an enamel plate on each side.\r\nThe labial plate always borders the outer re-entrant fold, and in the\r\nsubgenus _Orthogeomys_ is infrequently separated into two small\r\nplates.\r\n\r\nThe mandible is relatively long. Its masseteric ridge is well\r\ndeveloped and massive. The basitemporal fossa is usually deep and well\r\ndefined; it tends to be shallow in the subgenus _Orthogeomys_, and in\r\nyoung individuals is hardly more than a slight depression.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey to the Subgenera of _Orthogeomys_\r\n\r\n  A  Frontal wide and greatly inflated; no interorbital\r\n     constriction; enamel plate on posterior wall of P4 usually\r\n     absent, although sometimes having small plate, restricted\r\n     to lingual end of wall.

(actually about 5000 ft.), Jalisco.\r\n\r\n_Chronologic range._--Late Pliocene, from deposits of early Blancan\r\nage (Benson local fauna, Arizona) to the Recent. However in the\r\nPleistocene, only late Pleistocene records are known, and\r\n_Pappogeomys_ has not been found in early (late Blancan) or middle\r\n(Irvingtonian) Pleistocene local faunas. Presumably the genus was\r\nrestricted to México during the Pleistocene until post-Wisconsin time.\r\n\r\n_Description and discussion._--The size ranges from as little as in\r\nthe smaller kinds of _Thomomys_ to the maximum attained in the\r\nsubfamily and matched elsewhere perhaps in only a few of the larger\r\nsubspecies of _Orthogeomys grandis_. Depending on the species and\r\nsubgenus, the form of the skull varies from generalized to\r\nspecialized. The generalized skulls are short and not especially\r\nnarrow; the zygomatic arches are spread laterally so far that the\r\nbreadth across them exceeds the breadth across the mastoid processes.\r\nThe most specialized skulls are platycephalic and the breadth across\r\nthe mastoid processes equals or exceeds the breadth across the\r\nzygomatic arches (even so, the zygomatic arches are still relatively\r\nwidespread). In correlation with the great breadth of the posterior\r\npart of the cranium, the rami of the mandibles diverge widely\r\nposteriolaterally and the angular processes are remarkably elongated.\r\nThe rostrum is moderately broad in most species, but not nearly so\r\nbroad and heavy as in _Orthogeomys_.\r\n\r\nThe single deep, median sulcus on the outer surface of the upper\r\nincisor is slightly displaced to the inner side of the tooth. The\r\nposterior surface of P4 lacks enamel (small vestige found on lingual\r\nend of posterior wall in only two adult individuals--UA 3260 and KU\r\n100442, of the subgenus _Pappogeomys_); the other three plates are\r\nfully developed as usual. The p4 is provided with four fully developed\r\nenamel plates, in the pattern characteristic of the tribe Geomyini. In\r\nthe p4 of the late Pliocene species (_P. bensoni_) the re-entrant\r\nangles are open (obtuse), a trait that is evidently primitive in the\r\nGeomyini.\r\n\r\nAll three lower molars are single, compressed, elliptical columns with\r\nenamel on only the posterior surfaces. M1 and M2 are also elliptical\r\nin cross-section and decidedly anteroposteriorly compressed, like the\r\nlower molars. Nevertheless, the enamel pattern is variable; enamel\r\nplates may be retained completely across both the anterior and\r\nposterior walls of M1 and M2 or only the anterior plate may be\r\nretained without reduction and the posterior plate may be reduced so\r\nthat only a vestige is retained on the lingual fourth of the tooth or\r\nthe posterior plate may be completely lost.\r\n\r\nM3 tends to remain at least incompletely bilophodont by reason of\r\nretaining a permanent labial re-entrant fold in most species (with\r\nexceptions in _Pappogeomys bulleri_ and some old adults of _P.\r\ncastanops_). Primitively the occlusal surface of M3 is subtriangular\r\n(subgenus _Pappogeomys_), but in the _castanops_ species-group of the\r\nadvanced subgenus _Cratogeomys_, the posterior loph usually is reduced\r\nand the occlusal surface is quadriform or obcordate. Curiously, the\r\ntrend towards reduction of the posterior loph is reversed in one\r\nsubspecies (_P. merriami fulvescens_) and, the loph has elongated into\r\na pronounced heel in some specimens, resembling the condition in\r\n_Orthogeomys_. The entire range of variation occurs in _P. m.\r\nfulvescens_. The subtriangular pattern is retained in the most\r\nspecialized species of _Cratogeomys_ where that pattern is associated\r\nwith extreme platycephaly in the _gymnurus_ species-group. In most\r\nspecies the posterior loph supports two lateral plates, the outer one\r\nalways bordering the labial re-entrant fold. In _Pappogeomys bulleri_\r\nand in the _castanops_ species-group, the outer re-entrant fold of M3\r\ntends to be obsolete, and the tooth becomes quadriform or\r\nsuborbiculate in some individuals and loses the bilophodont pattern\r\nthat characterizes other species. The lingual enamel plate is\r\ndisplaced to the posterior surface of the tooth, and one or both\r\nplates may disappear with advancing age. Consequently, only the\r\nanterior enamel plate remains in some adults, and constitutes the\r\nmaximum degree of reduction of enamel on M3 in the Geomyinae. In many\r\nadults of _Pappogeomys bulleri_, the enamel investment of the\r\nposterior loph is complete and the two lateral plates are connected,\r\nwithout interruption around the posterior apex of the tooth, evidently\r\nrepresenting the retention of a primitive character of the ancestral\r\nlineage.\r\n\r\nThe m3 of _P. bensoni_ from the late Pliocene is distinguished by\r\nminute lateral inflections suggesting the primitive biprismatic\r\npattern. Also the posterior enamel plates of m1 and m2 are remarkably\r\nlong, extending around the ends of the tooth. The associated upper\r\nincisor was unisulcate as in the modern species, and the basitemporal\r\nfossa of the mandible is well developed and deep.\r\n\r\nThe lower jaw is stout and relatively short. The masseteric ridge is\r\nwell developed and has an especially thick crest. The basitemporal\r\nfossa is deep. In most living species, the pelage is soft and dense,\r\nbut in one species, _Pappogeomys fumosus_, the hairs are coarse and\r\nhispid somewhat as in _Orthogeomys_.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey to the Subgenera of _Pappogeomys_\r\n\r\n  A  Enamel plates completely developed across posterior walls of\r\n     M1 and M2, except in one species (_P. alcorni_) having enamel\r\n     restricted to lingual fourth in M1; sagittal crest lacking\r\n     owing to impressions of temporal muscles remaining separated\r\n     (even in old adults); zygomata slender, and without platelike\r\n     expansion at lateral angle.

In the species having marked platycephalic skulls\r\n(_gymnurus_ species-group) the breadth across the squamosal processes\r\nequals or exceeds the breadth across the zygomatic arches (squamosal\r\nbreadth rarely 97 to 99% of zygomatic breadth), except in _P. zinseri_\r\nand _P. tylorhinus zodius_.\r\n\r\nThe variable character of the third upper molar as between species\r\nsuggests that this tooth is presently undergoing active evolution. The\r\nstructure of this tooth, although differing between taxa, is\r\nremarkably stable in other kinds of Geomyini. The most remarkable\r\nmodification of M3 in _Cratogeomys_ is the obcordate pattern\r\ndeveloped in _P. merriami_ of the _castanops_-group. The posterior\r\nloph and entire tooth is shortened somewhat resembling in shape that\r\nof _Thomomys_. Moreover, the posterior loph is twisted labially;\r\nconsequently, its posterior surface now forms the labial border of the\r\nweakly defined posterior loph. Owing to the torsion, the lingual\r\nenamel plate has been rotated to the posterior surface of the tooth.\r\nTherefore, the tooth is provided with two transverse enamel plates,\r\nincluding the plate on the anterior wall of the tooth. The labial\r\nplate is greatly reduced, its total surface being restricted to the\r\nsmall labial inflection. The highly specialized obcordate M3 is not\r\nfound in the most specialized platycephalic skulls characteristic of\r\nthe _gymnurus_ species-group. Instead the _gymnurus_-group retains the\r\nprimitive subtriangular pattern without significant modification.\r\n\r\n_Referred species._--Seven:\r\n\r\n\r\n_castanops_ species-group\r\n\r\n    _Pappogeomys castanops_ (Baird, 1852).

Even\r\nso, the stufenreihe closely approximates the general trend of\r\nevolution, and the level of structural organization in the different\r\nstages of phyletic development may be ascertained. The actual\r\nancestral series of most lineages probably will remain unknown, but\r\nhopefully some of the existing gaps will be filled by future\r\ndiscoveries. From the established record, several clearly defined\r\nlineages can be distinguished; in fact the sequence of origin, pattern\r\nof evolution, and specializations, of the principal lineages are\r\nreasonably well expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimitive Morphotype\r\n\r\nIn the earliest known geomyids from the Upper Oligocene and Lower\r\nMiocene, the premolars and molars are biprismatic and bilophodont. In\r\nrodents, this is itself a specialized pattern, and is thought to have\r\nevolved from a more primitive sextituberculate prototype by the union\r\nof individual cusps, and probably also cuspules, forming the two\r\ntransverse enamel lophs. The primitive, common ancestor of the\r\nGeomyidae and Heteromyidae with sextituberculate teeth in the early\r\nTertiary is unknown.\r\n\r\nAs soon as geomyids attained the early bilophodont stage of evolution,\r\nthe basic morphological structure of the family was established. The\r\nfamily probably first became clearly distinguished from other\r\nGeomyoidea at this stage. In the early bilophodont stages of\r\nevolution, owing to the relatively deep valley between them, the two\r\ncolumns probably failed to unite in the normal cycle of wear, as they\r\ndo in all later geomyids. _Griphomys_ described by Wilson (1940:93)\r\nfrom the late Eocene of California, has a bilophate pattern in which\r\nthe anterior and posterior lophs are separated by a persistent\r\ntransverse valley. The occlusal pattern of _Griphomys_ closely\r\nresembles a stage through which the ancestors of the early Miocene\r\ngeomyids must have passed in their pre-Miocene evolution, as Wilson\r\nsuggests (1949:115-116). Although he (1940:95; 1949:110-118)\r\ntentatively referred _Griphomys_ to the superfamily Geomyoidea and\r\nSimpson (1945:80) went so far as to refer it to the family Geomyidae,\r\nwith a notation of _incertae sedis_, its exact relationship to the\r\npocket gophers is uncertain. However, the structure of the molariform\r\ndentition of _Griphomys_ does not exclude it from the phyletic\r\nancestry of the Geomyidae. In subsequent stages of evolution the\r\nanterior and posterior columns become united. Thereby part of the\r\nvalley floor between the transverse prisms was progressively elevated,\r\nto the stage where attrition on the occlusal surface would unite the\r\ntwo columns. On the unworn enamel cap of living geomyids the two\r\ntransverse enamel folds are separated by a shallow but well defined\r\nvalley, briefly reflecting the ancient ancestral pattern.\r\n\r\nUnion of the lophs may have been either at the mid-points of the two\r\ncolumns or at the edge of their protomeres. [A protomere is the half\r\nof a tooth containing the protocone or protoconid--lingual side of\r\nupper tooth and labial side of lower tooth. The paramere is the\r\nopposite half of a given tooth--labial side of upper tooth and\r\nlingual side in lower tooth. See Miller and Gidley, 1918:434.] Union\r\nof the columns at the mid-points would have produced the figure-8\r\nocclusal pattern (or H-pattern), which is characteristic of the early\r\nMiocene Geomyinae (_Dikkomys_). Union of the two columns at the\r\nprotomeres would have produced the U-shaped pattern of the\r\nEntoptychinae, which also occurred in the early Miocene and were\r\ncontemporary with the earliest Geomyinae. Since pre-Miocene geomyids\r\nare unknown, the actual phyletic development of the dentition is a\r\nmatter of speculation. Probably the development of the two divergent\r\nlineages, one leading to the Entoptychinae and the other to the\r\nsubfamily Geomyinae, occurred in the Oligocene (as depicted in Fig.\r\n3). Of the two lineages, the subfamily Geomyinae, in my view, is the\r\nmore primitive and less specialized. Support for this view is\r\nfurnished by a reconstruction of the pattern of occlusal wear in\r\n_Dikkomys_ and _Pliosaccomys_, especially on the first and second\r\nmolars.\r\n\r\nIn _Dikkomys_, the anterior and posterior column first unite near\r\ntheir mid-points in the first stages of wear thus producing a figure-8\r\nshaped (H-shaped) occlusal pattern in the premolar and all three\r\nmolars. Evidently in the first two upper molars, the columns unite\r\ncloser to their lingual margins than their mid-points, but at any rate\r\nboth outer and inner re-entrant folds are evident at this stage of\r\nwear. With continued attrition on m1 and m2 of _Dikkomys_, the\r\nanterior and posterior columns secondarily unite at the edge of their\r\nlabial margins thus enclosing a fossette of enamel in the labial half\r\nof the tooth. The lateral coalescence at the ends of the protomeres\r\noccurs because of the shallow vertical depth of the labial re-entrant\r\nfold, and the fossette itself does not reach the base of the crown and\r\nwith continued wear it too would disappear, but not until the last\r\nstages of wear, at least in _Dikkomys matthewi_. The lingual\r\nre-entrant fold is deep, and therefore, persistent through all stages\r\nof wear. Although the amount of wear required for its effacement would\r\nbe great, the occlusal configuration of the first and second lower\r\nmolars in _Dikkomys_ could be eventually ground down to a U-pattern as\r\nin the entoptychids. Only one upper molar of _Dikkomys_, the first,\r\nhas been recovered (see Wood, 1936:23, fig. 32B). Although the tooth\r\nis in an early stage of wear, the lingual valley is minute. Less\r\nattrition than required in m1 and m2 would progressively reduce the\r\nlingual fold until it too would essentially form a U-pattern, perhaps\r\nretaining a slight lingual inflection. Hence, the first upper molar\r\nbecomes a mirror image of the first lower molar, and the second upper\r\nmolar probably had the same pattern as the first (at least it does so\r\nin _Pliosaccomys_). Both of the lateral re-entrant folds of the\r\npremolar are deep vertically, and consequently would not disappear\r\nwith occlusal wear. Therefore, the H-pattern of the premolars is\r\nretained throughout life.\r\n\r\nThe m3 (M3 unknown for _Dikkomys_ or _Pliosaccomys_) also has deep\r\nlateral folds; hence, it too retains the H-pattern in all stages of\r\nattrition, although the isthmus between the two prisms may become\r\nwider in the final phases of wear (as it does in _Pliosaccomys_).\r\n\r\nIn _Pliosaccomys_, the stages of wear are essentially the same as\r\nthose described for _Dikkomys_, except that the anterior and posterior\r\nloph of the first and second molars tend to unite closer to one side\r\nof the tooth, lingual side in upper molars and labial in lower. Only a\r\nslight inflection of the re-entrant fold is evident on the side of\r\nunion, and the inflection disappears in the first phases of wear as\r\nthe columns unite. Concomitant with the lateral shift in the initial\r\npoint of coalescence of the transverse lophs, the occlusal penetration\r\nof the re-entrant fold from the opposite side increases in horizontal\r\ndepth, and the fold extends medially more than half way across the\r\nocclusal surface, thus forming a pattern essentially like that of the\r\nentoptychids. The U-pattern in _Pliosaccomys_ appears in the initial\r\nstages of wear without going through an earlier H-pattern as is the\r\ncase in its Miocene ancestors of the genus _Dikkomys_, unless the\r\nminute inflection is considered as indicative of that stage. The two\r\ncolumns of the premolar and m3 are joined near their mid-points as in\r\n_Dikkomys_; therefore, they retain their primitive H-pattern, a\r\nfeature unique to the Geomyinae.\r\n\r\nThe evolutionary trend toward an ontogenetically earlier U-pattern in\r\nthe first two molars in the primitive lineage of the Geomyinae\r\nsuggests that the U-pattern characteristic of the Entoptychinae was\r\nsimply an earlier tendency toward the same specialization that\r\noccurred later in the subfamily Geomyinae. If so, early entoptychines\r\nwould have been characterized by an H-pattern in the first stages of\r\nattrition, like _Dikkomys_, and later developed union at the edge of\r\nthe protomeres. However, in the entoptychines, all the molariform\r\ndentition, and not merely the first and second molar, became\r\nspecialized; consequently the U-pattern was produced on the occlusal\r\nsurfaces of each of the cheek teeth. As in _Pliosaccomys_, the\r\ntransitional phase, in which the two columns were united at their\r\nmid-points, was eventually eliminated from the pattern of wear and\r\nonly the U-pattern, that now appeared in the initial stages of wear,\r\nwas retained. In the entoptychines of the early Miocene there is no\r\nsuggestion of the H-pattern that characterizes the Geomyinae, except\r\nin the position of the cusps before wear in the lower molars of\r\n_Pleurolicus sulcifrons_, which, according to Wood (1936:6), suggests\r\nthe H-pattern. In earlier unknown Oligocene stages of evolution, the\r\nprisms possibly united first at their mid-points, and the columns may\r\nhave joined at the side of the tooth only in the terminal stages of\r\nwear. The U-pattern of pre-Miocene entoptychines, therefore, may have\r\nbecome the dominant occlusal pattern only in the later stages of\r\nphyletic development.\r\n\r\nAccording to the recently expressed views of several paleontologists,\r\nthe Entoptychinae constitute the primitive lineage of the family and\r\nthe early Geomyinae constitute a specialized offshoot of the\r\nentoptychine ancestral assemblage. The structure of the Entoptychinae,\r\nespecially of the less advanced genera, closely approximates that of\r\nthe hypothetical primitive morphotype. But, according to my view, the\r\nsubfamily Geomyinae constitutes the ancestral assemblage and its\r\nstructure is essentially that of the primitive morphotype of the\r\nfamily. At any rate the structure of the early geomyines more closely\r\napproximates the structure of the ancestral stock than the more\r\ndivergent entoptychines. Therefore, the genus _Dikkomys_ of the early\r\nMiocene, the first known geomyine, is considered to be a generalized\r\ngeomyid, and, although it is a contemporary of the more specialized\r\nentoptychid assemblage, is considered to be more closely allied to the\r\nancestral stock.\r\n\r\nThe entoptychines were the dominant and most highly differentiated\r\ngeomyids of the early and middle Miocene. Nevertheless, they became\r\nextinct in the middle Miocene, and the geomyines of that time survived\r\nand later gave rise to the modern pocket gophers. Therefore, the early\r\nhistory of the family Geomyidae is characterized by an early radiation\r\nand trend toward specialization, followed by survival of the less\r\nspecialized Geomyinae and extinction of the more specialized\r\nEntoptychinae.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntoptychid Radiation\r\n\r\nThe most abundant geomyids of the early and middle Miocene, the\r\nEntoptychinae, consisted of at least 24 species (see Wood, 1936:4-25)\r\nclassified in four genera: _Pleurolicus_, _Gregorymys_, _Grangerimus_,\r\nand _Entoptychus_. The genera were essentially contemporaneous (see\r\nFigure 3). Even so, the subfamily was morphologically varied, pointing\r\nto an earlier origin in the Oligocene (actually a part of the John Day\r\nFauna, including _Pleurolicus_ may be correlated with late Oligocene\r\nWhitneyian age) followed by a relatively rapid radiation including all\r\nfour genera in the early Miocene. Two genera, _Pleurolicus_ and\r\n_Gregorymys_, continued into the Middle Miocene (Hemingfordian). This\r\ndivergence, specialization, and subsequent radiation suggest that the\r\nentoptychines evolved into a new major adaptive zone, in the sense\r\ndescribed by Simpson (1945:199-206).\r\n\r\nThe radiation is correlated geographically and temporally with the\r\nsouthward retreat of the Neotropical flora of the Tertiary from the\r\nwestern United States and southward movement of the Arctic flora of\r\nthe Tertiary (see Axlerod, 1950; Berry, 1937:31-46; Chaney,\r\n1947:139-148; and Kendeigh, 1961:280-283). In the early Tertiary the\r\nNeotropical-tertiary geoflora occurred northward to at least 49°\r\nlatitude in western North America, and the boreal Arctic-tertiary\r\nflora was restricted to a circumpolar zone. The southward and eastward\r\nshift of the Neotropical-tertiary flora, associated with the drying\r\nand chilling of the continent, began in the middle or late Oligocene\r\nand was concurrent with the divergence and radiation of the\r\nEntoptychinae. Beginning in late Oligocene and continuing at least\r\ninto middle Miocene, most of the region in which the entoptychines\r\noccurred was occupied by the Arcto-tertiary geoflora of which the\r\ntemperate forest division contributed the dominate plant associations.\r\nThe maples, chestnuts, dogwoods, beeches, walnuts, oaks, elms,\r\nbirches, and sycamores of that flora were the forerunners of today's\r\neastern deciduous forest. It is my view that the entoptychines became\r\nadapted to the conditions of this paleoecological environment and\r\nradiated rapidly in the Arikareean when the major change occurred in\r\nclimax vegetation. The ancestral stock of the Geomyinae was not so\r\nsuccessful in the Arcto-tertiary climax, and most of it probably was\r\ndisplaced southward along with the tropical flora.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton in the entoptychines is not so strongly fossorial as in\r\nthe modern geomyids (Wilson, 1949:117), and these early geomyids\r\nprobably were semi-fossorial with somewhat the same burrowing habits\r\nas those of the living mountain beaver (_Aplodontia_). Inasmuch as the\r\nmorphology and taxonomy of the entoptychines were discussed in detail\r\nby Cope (1884) and reviewed later by Wood (_loc. cit._), there is no\r\nneed to recount the details here. According to Wood (_op. cit._,\r\n27-28), _Pleurolicus_ occupied a central position in the entoptychid\r\nradiation and perhaps appeared slightly earlier than the other genera.\r\nWilson (1949) suggested that the lower part of the John Day may\r\nactually be Upper Oligocene rather than Lower Miocene, and this\r\narrangement is followed here. Also, _Pleurolicus_ is less specialized\r\nthan the other genera and occurs in deposits of both the Great Plains\r\nand the Pacific Coast. _Gregorymys_, also little specialized, occurred\r\nonly on the Great Plains. The more specialized genera, _Grangerimus_\r\nand _Entoptycus_, evidently appeared somewhat later than _Pleurolicus_\r\nand evolved from it. Except for a record from southern Texas reported\r\nrecently by Hibbard and Wilson (1950:621-623) and the new species\r\ndescribed by MacDonald (1963:182) from the Sharps Formation of South\r\nDakota (early Arikareean), _Grangerimus_ is known only from the\r\nPacific coast. _Entoptycus_ was restricted to the Pacific Coast (John\r\nDay fauna).\r\n\r\n_Entoptycus_ is the most specialized of the known genera; it has\r\npronounced fossorial adaptations, especially in the skull. Its\r\nmolariform teeth are rootless and ever-growing as in the modern\r\ngeomyines. Moreover, the continuous enamel bands on only moderately\r\nworn teeth become separated in the final stages of wear into anterior\r\nand posterior enamel plates by tracts of dentine that extend toward\r\nthe crown on the sides of each tooth. This extension was made possible\r\nby the union of the two columns at both the lingual and labial margins\r\nof the tooth forming an O-pattern, and the crown is essentially\r\nmonoprismatic save for the isolated enamel fossette in the center of\r\nthe tooth. The fossette is all that remains of the lateral re-entrant\r\nfold that characterized the preceding U-pattern of the earlier stages\r\nof wear. Late in the sequence of wear, the anterior enamel plate is\r\nlost in the lower molars and the posterior plate in the upper molars.\r\nThe U-pattern characterizes the final stages of attrition in the other\r\ngenera of the Entoptychinae; none developed the dental specializations\r\nseen in _Entoptycus_. Rootless, ever-growing cheek teeth,\r\ndiscontinuous enamel patterns, and monoprismatic molars were not\r\nevolved in the subfamily Geomyinae until the late Pliocene.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhyletic Trends in Subfamily Geomyinae\r\n\r\nThe subfamily Geomyinae is made up of three groups, recognized\r\ntaxonomically for the first time in this account as\r\ntribes--Dikkomyini, Thomomyini, and Geomyini (for full discussion of\r\nclassification, see previous account). The phylogeny proposed by me is\r\nillustrated in Figure 3. The tribe Dikkomyini is characterized by\r\ngeneralized and primitive features that together form the basic\r\nstructural foundation of the subfamily. Evolution within the\r\nDikkomyini resulted in the acquisition and perfection of fossorial\r\nadaptations. The Thomomyini and Geomyini are considerably more\r\nspecialized than the ancestral Dikkomyini from which they evolved.\r\nThe Geomyini are clearly more specialized than the Thomomyini,\r\nsuggesting closer affinity between the Thomomyini and the Dikkomyini\r\nthan between the Geomyini and the Dikkomyini. The specializations in\r\nthe dentition and the associated changes in the skull of the\r\nThomomyini and Geomyini permit more efficient mastication of fibrous\r\nvegetation. Along with these specializations, fossorial adaptations\r\ninherited from the Dikkomyini are retained without noteworthy\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\n_Dikkomys_, the earliest known genus of the tribe Dikkomyini, can be\r\ntaken as a starting point of evolution for the subfamily Geomyinae.\r\nThe Pliocene genus _Pliosaccomys_ is the only other known geomyine\r\nhaving primitive features closely resembling those of _Dikkomys_. The\r\nrelatively close but previously unrecognized relationship between\r\n_Dikkomys_ and _Pliosaccomys_ can be understood when patterns of wear\r\non the occlusal surfaces of the cheek teeth are taken into account. It\r\nappears that _Pliosaccomys_ descended from _Dikkomys_-like stock, if\r\nnot _Dikkomys_ itself. Although _Dikkomys_ is towards the beginning of\r\nthis phyletic sequence and _Pliosaccomys_ towards the end of the\r\nsequence, the primitive features shared by the two provide a\r\ngeneralized morphotype for the subfamily Geomyinae.\r\n\r\nIn the molariform dentition, an almost complete series of stages of\r\nwear in _Pliosaccomys_ has been preserved, and those of _Dikkomys_ can\r\nbe reconstructed with reasonable accuracy from those that are known\r\n(see Fig. 4):\r\n\r\n(1) In the initial stage of wear in _Dikkomys_ the anterior and\r\nposterior columns are separated by an intervening valley (Fig. 4A),\r\nand the occlusal surface of each column bears a loph of dentine\r\nsurrounded by a ring of enamel: protoloph on the anterior column and\r\nmetaloph on the posterior column of the upper teeth (protolophid and\r\nhypolophid in corresponding positions in the lower teeth). Actually\r\nthis stage is not preserved in the known material of _Dikkomys_, but\r\ndoes occur in both geomyines and entoptychines in all stages of\r\nevolution, and it must have also occurred in _Dikkomys_ in order for\r\nthe next two stages, which are preserved, to have developed.\r\n\r\n(2) The occlusal surfaces are ground down to a level where the enamel\r\nloops of the two columns join at their mid-points, thus forming an\r\nH-shaped pattern (Fig. 4B), or more exactly a pattern resembling a\r\nfigure 8. Probably this was the primitive pattern in the final stage\r\nof wear in the geomyid ancestor of the Oligocene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Diagram depicting geologic range and probable\r\nphyletic relationships of the family Geomyidae. Dashed lines represent\r\nparts of lineages that are not represented by fossil records, and\r\nsolid lines represent parts of lineages verified by actual specimens.\r\nQuestion marks indicate uncertainty of suggested ancestry of known\r\ntaxa. The relationships within the subfamily Entoptychinae are\r\nmodified after Wood (1936), and the temporal range of the Miocene\r\ngeomyids have been adjusted to agree with current stratigraphic\r\ncorrelations. Hence, _Pleurolicus_, _Gregorymys_ and _Dikkomys_ are\r\nillustrated as ranging into the Hemingfordian, rather than being\r\nconfined to the Arikareean (see MacDonald, 1963, and Black, 1961).]\r\n\r\n(3) In the pre-final stage of wear, the anterior and posterior lophs\r\nof the first and second molars unite secondarily at the edge of their\r\nprotomeres (labial side in the lower and lingual in the upper), thus\r\nenclosing an isolated enamel fossette (Fig. 4C). Lateral union occurs\r\nin the lower teeth because the vertical depth of the labial re-entrant\r\nangle is less than the depth of the lingual re-entrant fold. In the\r\nupper teeth the reverse is true. The re-entrant angle on one side of\r\nthe premolar is as deep vertically as the angle on the other side of\r\nthat tooth, and both reach the base of the crown; therefore, they do\r\nnot disappear at any stage of attrition. The same pertains in the\r\nthird lower molar.\r\n\r\n(4) In the final stage of wear (Fig. 4D), the enamel fossette\r\ndisappears as a result of continued attrition on the occlusal surface\r\nin the upper series. The fossette may vary somewhat in vertical depth\r\nin m1 and m2, but the amount of wear required for its effacement would\r\nbe greater than in the upper teeth. Therefore, upon wear, the\r\nU-pattern would become characteristic of the final stage in M1 (and\r\nprobably also M2), but the modified H-pattern described in Fig. 4C\r\nwould prevail in m1 and m2. Perhaps, in extremely worn teeth, the\r\nlabial fossette of m1 and m2 would disappear. If this advanced stage\r\nof effacement is obtained, then the two columns would be united across\r\nthe entire surface of their protomeres from the center of the crown to\r\nits labial edge, and the occlusal pattern would be in the shape of a\r\nU.\r\n\r\nThe occlusal pattern, at least in M1 and M2, in the final stages of\r\nwear in _Dikkomys_ resembles that in the subfamily Entoptychinae, but\r\nthe U-pattern develops on only the first and probably the second molar\r\nin _Dikkomys_ and not on all of the cheek teeth as it does in the\r\nentoptychines. Judging from the material that has been described, the\r\nU-pattern did not develop in the lower teeth of _Dikkomys_ until the\r\nHemingfordian (_D. woodi_), upper Rosebud, and specimens of _D.\r\nmatthewi_ from the earlier Arikareean, lower Harrison, suggest that\r\nthe modified H-pattern, with secondary coalescence at the edge of the\r\nprotomeres, persisted throughout life, without developing the\r\nU-pattern in the final stages of wear.\r\n\r\nEssentially the same patterns of wear characterize the genus\r\n_Pliosaccomys_, except that the earlier stages were telescoped and the\r\nsecond stage was omitted while another (final) stage was added. The\r\nstages are reconstructed in sequence in figure 4, and all are based on\r\npreserved dentitions, as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The first phases of wear produced the pattern (Fig. 4E and I)\r\ndescribed for _Dikkomys_ in the previous account (Fig 4A).\r\n\r\n(2) A small additional amount of wear produced the 2nd stage (Fig. 4F\r\nand J) characterized by a U-pattern, formed by union of the anterior\r\nand posterior columns at the edge of the protomeres of the first and\r\nsecond molars, both above and below, without first forming an H-shaped\r\npattern. Union at the mid-points thus was omitted from the sequence of\r\nwear in these two teeth. In the premolars and third molars the\r\nprimitive H-pattern did form, as in _Dikkomys_. The pattern of wear in\r\nthe first two molars is the same as in the entoptychines of the early\r\nMiocene. The trend of evolution through which the _Pliosaccomys_\r\nlineage passed must have featured a progressively earlier union at the\r\nedge of the tooth until the lateral coalescence occurred\r\nsimultaneously with the median union. At that stage, emphasis was\r\nshifted to the union at the edge of the tooth, and eventually the\r\nteeth failed to unite at their mid-points and the U-pattern developed\r\ndirectly. Therefore, the horizontally deep re-entrant fold that\r\nseparates the two lophs of the U-pattern is equivalent to one fold\r\nplus the apex of the opposite fold.\r\n\r\n(3) The horizontal re-entrant fold of the U-pattern was remarkably\r\nshallow vertically and disappeared with little additional wear. Thus\r\nthe two parts of M1, and also of M2, are united into a single column\r\nexcept for a slight inflection on the labial side and this is true\r\nalso of m1 and m2 except for a slight inflection on the lingual side\r\n(Fig. 4G and K). The inflection appears to have persisted in the upper\r\nteeth (Fig. 4H), but evidently with slight wear, disappeared in the\r\nlower teeth (Fig. 4L). The final monocolumnar pattern was attained\r\nearly ontogenetically, evidently before the permanent premolar had\r\nfully erupted; hence, the earlier stages occurred only in transition,\r\npersisted for only a brief interval in the teeth of juveniles, and the\r\nfinal stage developed in the young animal and lasted throughout the\r\nrest of its life in _Pliosaccomys_. In _Dikkomys_ the two columns\r\nnever united into a single column, and a bilophodont occlusal pattern\r\npersisted throughout life.\r\n\r\nThe early phyletic development of the subfamily Geomyinae took place\r\nin the tribe Dikkomyini from the early Miocene into the early\r\nPliocene. Compared with the rapid evolution of the specializations\r\nthat distinguish the Entoptychinae, the structural changes in the\r\nearly Geomyinae occurred at a remarkably slow rate. In fact the\r\nlineage changed but little from _Dikkomys_ to _Pliosaccomys_, in parts\r\nof the animal that can be compared, as illustrated by the low-crowned\r\nand rooted cheek teeth, the continuous enamel bands, the lack of\r\ngrooving of the upper incisor, the retention of the primitive\r\nH-pattern, both above and below, in the premolar and third lower\r\nmolar, and the ridges and fossae of the mandible to which the muscles\r\nof mastication attach. The only major changes detected in the known\r\nfragments are in the pattern of wear and the final configuration of\r\nthe first and second molars, as described above. The unification of\r\nthe two lophs in each of these two teeth into a single column was a\r\nsignificant step in the evolution of the Geomyinae, and is a stage\r\nbetween the primitive bilophodont pattern of the early and middle\r\nMiocene geomyines having continuously bicolumnar teeth and the\r\nmonolophodont pattern in the modern pocket gophers of both lineages in\r\nwhich these teeth consist of a single column in all but the initial\r\nstages of wear. The monocolumnar structure of the first and second\r\nmolars in the final stages of wear, therefore, is closer to that in\r\nthe lineage of _Thomomys_ than it is to that of _Dikkomys_. Other\r\nspecializations in the dentition of _Pliosaccomys_, especially in m1\r\nand m2 where the H-pattern has been completely eliminated from the\r\nsequence of wear, are too far advanced for _Pliosaccomys_ to have\r\ngiven rise to the tribe Geomyini. The teeth in the immediate ancestor\r\nof the Geomyini must have been less specialized in m1 and m2, perhaps\r\nabout as in _Dikkomys_. In the m1 and m2 of the tribe Geomyini, the\r\nH-pattern is formed in the initial stages of wear; therefore, in the\r\nearly Pliocene ancestor, presently unknown in the fossil record, the\r\nH-pattern probably was present. Even so, the ancestor of the Geomyini\r\nand that of _Pliosaccomys_ probably were closely allied otherwise, and\r\nboth probably had attained the highly specialized fossorial\r\nadaptations characterizing all modern pocket gophers, before the\r\ndivergence of _Pliosaccomys_ and the Geomyini took place.\r\n\r\nThe evidence points to a major divergence of the geomyines that lived\r\nin the latest Miocene or the early Pliocene (probably the latter) and\r\nthat gave rise to the two modern lineages, Thomomyini and Geomyini\r\n(see Fig. 3). One, the most primitive of the two, gave rise to the\r\nThomomyini lineage that eventually evolved into _Thomomys_.\r\n_Pliosaccomys_ is closely allied to the ancestry of this lineage,\r\nalthough it is probably not the actual ancestor, as mentioned\r\npreviously. Aside from the aforementioned specializations of the first\r\nand second molars, the features of the Thomomyini are less advanced\r\nthan in the other specialized lineage (tribe Geomyini). Primitive\r\ntraits retained in the tribe Thomomyini (and also characteristic of\r\nthe ancestral tribe Dikkomyini) are: (1) Small size, in general no\r\nlarger than the ancestral morphotype; (2) lack of grooving on the\r\nupper incisor (although a slight rudimentary groove is developed\r\nrarely in some living species); (3) retention of anterior and\r\nposterior enamel plates in lower and upper cheek teeth; (4) premolars\r\nhaving widely open re-entrant folds; (5) smooth and generalized skull\r\nlacking marked angularity, regosity or cresting (neither the sagittal\r\nnor the lambdoidal crest are ordinarily well developed except in\r\n_Thomomys bulbivorus_); (6) forefoot small, less modified for digging\r\nthan in the Geomyini.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 4.

The one genus,\r\n_Thomomys_, appears first in the Upper Pliocene (early Blancan time),\r\nand the specializations characterizing the lineage had already\r\ndeveloped by that time. Evidently, the early stages of divergence from\r\nthe ancestral stock resulted in the development of rootless,\r\never-growing, more hypsodont cheek teeth, simplification of M3, and\r\nenlargement of the masseteric ridge on the mandible. The enamel\r\ninvestment on the sides of the molariform teeth is interrupted owing\r\nto intrusion of tracts of dentine on the sides of each column. Even\r\nso, complete anterior and posterior plates are retained on all of the\r\ncheek teeth (Fig. 5, K and L) and there is no trend toward additional\r\nloss of enamel as in the Geomyini. The enamel on the sides of the\r\ncolumn has little functional value, and its elimination probably\r\nreduces friction during the anteroposterior movements of the lower\r\njaw, thereby increasing the efficiency of the cutting blades on the\r\nanterior and posterior wall of the tooth. The simplification of M3 was\r\nachieved by union of the two columns of the primitive pattern into a\r\nsingle column and obliteration of both the labial and lingual\r\nre-entrant folds in the first stages of wear. The adult tooth (see\r\nFig. 5L) is without trace of the bilophate pattern and is not\r\nelongated; therefore, its structure is essentially the same as that of\r\nthe first and second upper molars.\r\n\r\nIn the Thomomyini, the two lophs of the unworn molars unite entirely\r\nacross the width of their surfaces with the first traces of wear (see\r\nFig. 5, I and J), owing to the shallow and uniform depth of the\r\ntransverse valley. In the molars, the final pattern is acquired,\r\ntherefore, before the deciduous premolar has been replaced by the\r\npermanent tooth. A relatively shallow re-entrant inflection between\r\nthe ends of the parameres sometimes is retained, although it also will\r\ndisappear with slight additional wear. Therefore, both lophs tend to\r\nunite completely with the first stages of wear in the Thomomyini, thus\r\nomitting both U and H patterns from the sequence of wear. This is the\r\nhighest degree of specialization attained in the Geomyidae in regard\r\nto the patterns of wear, since a sequence of bilophodont patterns\r\nappear in both the Dikkomyini and Geomyini before the monoprismatic\r\npattern is developed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 5.

As in all geomyids, the upper part of the crown is\r\nbiprismatic in the newly erupted tooth, and the two columns are\r\nseparated by an intervening valley. With slight attrition on the\r\nunworn enamel cap, the weakly developed cusps merge and form a\r\ntransverse enamel loop on each of the two columns (see third molar in\r\nFig. 5, A and E), each loop enclosing a core of dentine that had\r\nbecome exposed. The valley between the two columns is shallow, and\r\nupon further wear of the tooth, the two loops unite. The two columns\r\nbecome joined at different points in the upper and lower molars\r\ndepending on the varying depth of the valley in different teeth.\r\nTherefore, upper and lower molars develop distinctly different\r\nocclusal configurations.\r\n\r\nIn the lower molars, the pattern characteristic of _Dikkomys_ (Fig.\r\n4C) is preserved without significant modification, as illustrated in\r\nan immature specimen of _Geomys_ (see Fig. 5E). The H-pattern and\r\nmodified H-pattern are developed in the same sequence of wear in the\r\nGeomyini. A juvenal female (not illustrated), KU 2931, provides an\r\nexample of the intermediate H-pattern. In this specimen, the\r\nprotolophid and hypolophid of the left m2 are united only at their\r\nmid-points, indicating that the pattern of wear occurs in the same\r\nsequence in the Geomyini as it did in the Miocene genus _Dikkomys_.\r\nAfter the two columns have become united at their mid-points, a\r\nsecondary union is formed at the edge of their protomeres, thus\r\nenclosing the enamel fossette as illustrated in Figure 5E (this is the\r\nmodified H-pattern mentioned above). However, the fossette itself is\r\nshallow and soon disappears with slight wear. At this stage, the\r\nocclusal configuration would be in a U-pattern (m1 in Fig. 5E). The\r\nlingual re-entrant fold is also shallow in vertical depth; therefore,\r\nit is obliterated by wear following the eradication of the labial\r\nfossette. Consequently, the two columns are united into one. In m3\r\n(see Figs. 5E, F, and G), the two columns merge by progressive lateral\r\nexpansion of the medial isthmus.\r\n\r\nIn the first and second upper molars, the two columns unite across the\r\nentire surface of their protomeres from near the lingual edge of the\r\ncrown to near its center. A minute inner inflection may be temporarily\r\nretained in some teeth. At this stage (see Fig. 5B), the parameres are\r\nstill separated by the labial fissure, and the occlusal pattern is in\r\nthe shape of a U, resembling, but not exactly duplicating, the\r\npre-final pattern of Ml and M2 in the genus _Pliosaccomys_ (see Fig.\r\n4H). The labial fissure is shallow, and, with further wear, the\r\ninflection is worn away and the parameres also unite, thereby forming\r\na monoprimatic crown in the final stage. In M3, the two lophs first\r\nbecome united near the edge of their protomeres (see Fig. 5B),\r\ntherefore forming a U-pattern similar to that developed in Ml and M2\r\nof _Pliosaccomys_. The connection of the two lophs is not directly at\r\nthe end of the protomere; consequently a shallow lingual inflection\r\nremains. The lingual edge of the valley is also shallow, and, with\r\ncontinued wear a second union of the two lophs takes place near the\r\nends of their parameres, and the deeper, interior part of the valley\r\nremains as an isolated enamel fossette (see Fig. 5C). The two primary\r\nlophs of the tooth are now joined near both sides, having shallow\r\nlingual and labial re-entrant angles on the sides and the enamel\r\nisland in the center. With continued effacement of the occlusal\r\nsurface, the fossette will be eradicated, and the pattern of the\r\nocclusal surface will become the partially biprismatic pattern of the\r\nfinal stages (adult) of wear (see Fig. 5D). M3's of _Dikkomys_ and\r\n_Pliosaccomys_ are not known; however, it seems reasonable to assume\r\nthat the pattern of wear in the M3 of Dikkomyini was not essentially\r\ndifferent from that of the Geomyini, except that it is likely that the\r\nU-pattern of the second stage of wear in the Geomyini was probably the\r\nfinal stage in the genus _Dikkomys_.\r\n\r\nJudging from the pre-final stages of wear, the dentition of the\r\nGeomyini provides a curious combination of patterns that resemble in\r\npart the Miocene genus _Dikkomys_ and in part the early and middle\r\nPliocene genus _Pliosaccomys_. There is no significant variation in\r\nthe premolars or third molars (at least in the lower teeth) of the\r\nGeomyinae from the early Miocene to late Pliocene; therefore,\r\ndeviations of major significance are in the character of the first and\r\nsecond molars. In the Geomyini, the patterns of wear of m1 and m2 are\r\nthe same as those of _Dikkomys_, and are distinctly different from\r\nthose of _Pliosaccomys_ where the two columns first unite at the edge\r\nof their protomeres to form a U-pattern, rather than at their\r\nmid-points to form an H-pattern. Even though the intermediate stages\r\nof ontogeny in m1 and m2 of _Pliosaccomys_ and the Geomyini are\r\nentirely different, the bicolumnar crowns of both eventually unite,\r\nupon wear, into a single column. On the other hand, the patterns of M1\r\nand M2 in the Geomyini most closely resemble those of _Pliosaccomys_,\r\nrather than _Dikkomys_. In this regard it should be pointed out that\r\nthe upper molars of _Dikkomys_ are presently represented by only one\r\ntooth, an M1 in an early stage of wear. As described already, the\r\npatterns of M1-2 evidently would be mirror images of m1-2 in\r\ncorresponding stages of wear. However, the initial union of the two\r\ncolumns, in the M1 that is known, is somewhat to the lingual side of\r\ncenter and the relatively small lingual valley does not reach the base\r\nof the crown, indicating, that eventually with wear, the two columns\r\nof _Dikkomys_ might have become united across the entire surface of\r\ntheir protomeres as in _Pliosaccomys_. Even so, the two columns of M1\r\ndo initially join closer to their mid-points than they do in\r\n_Pliosaccomys_, and, if they did actually unite across their\r\nprotomeres, the union would have occurred with subsequent wear. That\r\nis, the first occlusal pattern would be H-shaped (but with the\r\nconnection closer to the lingual than the labial side), as in m1 and\r\nm2, and it would become U-shaped only after additional wear. This\r\nsequence of patterns of M1 and M2, as already pointed out, does not\r\npertain in _Pliosaccomys_ or the Geomyini, since the U-pattern is\r\nformed with the first union of the two columns at the edge of their\r\nprotomeres, and the primitive H-pattern is never developed, unless one\r\ncounts the slight lingual inflection, that occasionally is formed just\r\nafter the two columns unite, as being indicative of the primitive\r\npattern. As in the lower teeth, the bicolumnar crowns of early\r\nontogeny in both _Pliosaccomys_ and the Geomyini become eventually\r\nunited, with wear, into a single column.\r\n\r\nBased upon the foregoing evidence, it would seem likely that the\r\nGeomyini evolved from an early Pliocene (perhaps late Miocene)\r\nDikkomyini ancestor that had evolved the specializations of M1 and M2\r\nthat characterize its relative, _Pliosaccomys_, but had not also\r\nevolved the specializations of m1 and m2 that distinguish\r\n_Pliosaccomys_. Therefore, the ancestor of the Geomyini differed from\r\nthe _Pliosaccomys_-Thomomyini lineage in its retention, unmodified, of\r\nthe primitive patterns in m1 and m2 that characterized the earliest\r\nknown Geomyines (_Dikkomys_). The same patterns are preserved in m1\r\nand m2 of its modern descendents, the living Geomyini. In the\r\n_Pliosaccomys_-Thomomyini lineage the pattern of m1 and m2 are\r\nentirely different, as described above.\r\n\r\nThe earliest record of the Geomyini is the extinct genus _Pliogeomys_\r\n(see Fig. 6) in the latest Hemphillian (middle Pliocene) and earliest\r\nBlancan (late Pliocene). _Pliogeomys_ is more primitive than any\r\nmodern genus of the Geomyini, seems to have been a late survivor of\r\nthe primitive stock, but was itself probably a collateral lineage and\r\nnot on the direct line of descent. The cheek teeth in _Pliogeomys_ are\r\nrooted and less hypsodont than in the late Pliocene examples of the\r\nmodern genera, and the anterior enamel plate of the lower molars shows\r\nno indication of reduction, as would be expected if _Pliogeomys_ were\r\nin the direct line of evolution. Separation of _Pliogeomys_ from the\r\nmain stem of the Geomyini probably occurred after several\r\nspecializations had already been achieved by the Geomyini. Two\r\ninheritances might have been grooving on the upper incisors and some\r\nreduction in amount of enamel on the sides of the cheek teeth. The\r\ndentine tracts on the sides of the cheek teeth of _Pliogeomys_ are\r\nnarrow (see Fig. 7A) and barely separate the enamel blades and there\r\nis no discernible reduction in the anterior enamel blades on its lower\r\nmolars. Those blades evidently were lost in the main lineage before\r\nthe Pleistocene radiation of the living genera took place.\r\n_Pliogeomys_ is in an intermediate stage in evolution, and was not so\r\nadvanced as was the main lineage at the time _Pliogeomys_ died out.\r\nIts structure does provide clues as to phyletic development that took\r\nplace in the main lineage.\r\n\r\nSpecialized trends in the early phylogeny of the Geomyini included:\r\ndevelopment of rootless, ever-growing cheek teeth and an increase in\r\nhypsodonty; loss of the bicolumnar structure of the first and second\r\nmolars, and, consequently, the formation of a single elliptical column\r\nin the final stage of wear; interruption of the enamel investment of\r\nthe molariform teeth and formation of anterior and posterior enamel\r\nplates; and enlargement of the masseteric ridge and fossa. Each of\r\nthese trends occurred independently in the Thomomyini, and each is an\r\nexample of parallelism in the phyletic evolution of the two lineages.\r\nThree additional specializations lacking in the Thomomyini are the\r\ngrooving on upper incisors, loss of anterior enamel plate in lower\r\nmolars, and development of a basitemporal fossa on the mandible.\r\nEvidently, two grooves evolved in the ancestral incisors in the same\r\nbisculcate pattern preserved in _Pliogeomys_, _Zygogeomys_ and\r\n_Geomys_. The innermost groove is weakly developed in _Pliogeomys_,\r\nsuggesting that this character was in an intermediate stage of\r\nevolution in the ancestral lineage at the time that _Pliogeomys_ split\r\noff. Numerous other specializations in the Geomyini appeared later,\r\nbut evolved in the different genera that diverged from the ancestral\r\nlineage and are discussed separately in the next account. Only two of\r\nthe major features characterizing the Dikkomyini are retained in the\r\nGeomyini: the H-pattern on the occlusal surface of the m1 and m2\r\ndeveloped during the initial stages of wear, and the bicolumnar\r\npattern of M3. Adaptive radiation produced the living genera of the\r\nGeomyini in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene (see Fig. 6) and\r\nsubsequent specialization of the ancestral morphology followed.\r\n\r\nParallelism in the molars of later geomyines and the Entoptychinae is\r\nillustrated by the lateral interruption of the enamel investment and\r\nloss of enamel plates and by the omission of the H-pattern stage in\r\nthe first and second molars (in _Pliosaccomys_). Resemblance of\r\ndentitions in certain stages of wear in _Pliosaccomys_ and in\r\nentoptychines led some investigators, for instance, Hibbard\r\n(1953:357), to suggest that _Pliosaccomys_ descended from one of the\r\nless specialized entoptychines, possibly _Grangerimus_ but probably\r\n_Gregorymys_. Actually, the highly specialized upper and lower\r\npremolars and third molars of the entoptychines rule them out as\r\nancestors of the later geomyines. The evolution of entoptychine-like\r\nfeatures in _Pliosaccomys_ is regarded as an example of iteration, a\r\npattern of parallelism (see Simpson, 1953:248-253) where an\r\nallochronic and independent lineage undergoes the same evolutionary\r\ntrend that phyletically characterized an earlier lineage, usually\r\nafter the latter has become extinct. In this case, the lineage giving\r\nrise to _Pliosaccomys_ passed through the same phyletic stages in its\r\nevolution in the early Pliocene (and possibly the late Miocene) as did\r\nthe entoptychines in the late Oligocene and early Miocene.\r\n\r\nAnother parallelism by iteration, occurring in the middle and late\r\nPliocene in both the Thomomyini and Geomyini, is the loss of enamel\r\nfrom the lateral surfaces of the cheek teeth, and, in the Geomyini\r\nonly, the eventual loss of the anterior plate in the lower teeth and\r\nthe posterior plate in the upper teeth. Both features were evolved\r\nmore than an epoch earlier in the specialized entoptychid genus\r\n_Entoptychus_ of the lower Miocene. In _Entoptychus_, only the\r\nposterior plate of the lower molars and the anterior plate of the\r\nupper molars remained in the final stages of attrition, although a\r\ncentral enamel fossette, a remnant of the re-entrant fold, remained\r\nthroughout life. Iteration is also expressed in the subfamily\r\nGeomyinae by the development of grooving on the upper incisor and the\r\nformation of the basitemporal fossa. A shallow but distinct\r\nbasitemporal fossa occurs between the coronoid process and the third\r\nlower molar in the genus _Entoptychus_ and a sulcated upper incisor, a\r\nsingle shallow groove usually near the median border of the tooth, is\r\nfound in the genus _Gregorymys_ of the subfamily Entoptychinae. Both\r\nfeatures are regarded as advanced specializations in the tribe\r\nGeomyini, even though each was evolved in the entoptychines of the\r\nLower Miocene.\r\n\r\nThe postcranial skeleton of living genera of pocket gophers, as befits\r\nanimals that spend most of their life within underground burrows, are\r\nhighly specialized for a fossorial life. Elements of the postcranial\r\nskeleton recovered from Lower Miocene deposits indicate that the\r\nentoptychines were only semi-fossorial (see Cope, 1884:857; Wood,\r\n1936:4-5; Wilson, 1949:117-118). One of the basic trends of the\r\nentoptychines was towards greater fossorial adaptation; the skeleton\r\nof _Entoptychus_ shows a greater degree of fossorial adaptation than\r\nearlier genera of the subfamily. There is no reason to suppose that\r\nthe geomyine genus _Dikkomys_, which lived at the same times as the\r\nentoptychines, had acquired any more advanced fossorial adaptations\r\nthan had the entoptychines.\r\n\r\nThe most pronounced fossorial adaptations seem to have evolved only in\r\nthe ancestral lineage of the modern geomyines, probably in the latter\r\npart of the Miocene and in the early Pliocene, before the modern\r\nThomomyini and Geomyini diverged. Extreme fossorial adaptations in\r\nherbivorous rodents, such as those characteristic of the modern pocket\r\ngophers and their immediate ancestors, are thought to have evolved\r\nonly in response to pronounced arid conditions. The Entoptychinae and\r\nevidently the early geomyines lived in environments that were either\r\ntropical or temperate, and under conditions more mesic than I would\r\nconsider necessary to bring about selection pressure resulting in\r\nfossorial specializations. In late Oligocene and early Miocene,\r\naccording to Axelroad (1958:433-509), arid conditions did not exist in\r\nthe United States, and the only xerophytic environments in North\r\nAmerica occurred on the Central Plateau of México. Moreover (Axelroad,\r\n_loc. cit._), arid conditions did not develop in the western United\r\nStates until the early Pliocene. Geomyids evidently became extinct in\r\nthis region at the close of the Middle Miocene, and none appear in\r\nfossil deposits in the western United States until the latest Lower\r\nPliocene (Clarendonian). The reappearance of geomyids, _Pliosaccomys_,\r\nin the western United States coincides with a trend toward aridity and\r\nthe northward movement of the Madro-tertiary geoflora into the Great\r\nBasin and Great Plains from its place of origin on the Central Plateau\r\nof México (Axelroad, _loc. cit._). Later, in the middle and later\r\nPliocene, the Madro-tertiary geoflora gave rise to the modern\r\nxerophytic plants that now characterize the desert vegetation of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe Madro-tertiary climax does not appear as a major flora until the\r\nMiocene, but probably originated earlier. According to Axelroad (_loc.\r\ncit._), this xerophytic flora evolved from elements of the\r\nNeotropical-tertiary geoflora that became adapted to arid conditions\r\nthat developed in the rain shadow of the high mountains flanking the\r\nCentral Plateau of México. Originally, the Madro-tertiary flora\r\nconsisted of small trees, shrubs, and grasses. Although some elements\r\nof this flora moved northward in the late Miocene, the major part of\r\nit remained in México until the early Pliocene. In the western United\r\nStates, mountain formation increased in intensity in the Pliocene and\r\ncontinued on into the early Pleistocene. As the mountains became more\r\nelevated, especially the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges, they\r\nblocked the prevailing winds from the Pacific Ocean and extensive\r\naridity developed on their leeward side. As xeric conditions became\r\nwidespread, the Madro-tertiary flora successfully occupied the drier\r\nregions of southern California, the Great Basin, and the western parts\r\nof the Great Plains.\r\n\r\nWhile the Entoptychinae probably evolved in response to the\r\nArcto-tertiary flora, the late Tertiary geomyines probably evolved in\r\nresponse to the Madro-tertiary geoflora on the Central Plateau of\r\nMéxico. Some of these early geomyines, especially ancestors of the\r\nmodern lineages, probably were pushed southward by competition with\r\nthe more specialized entoptychines. Most geomyines were pushed out of\r\nthe northern area of distribution, except for _Dikkomys_ that survived\r\nin association with the entoptychids throughout the early and middle\r\nMiocene. During this time, and probably continuing on into the late\r\nMiocene, the geomyines occurring to the south in México became adapted\r\nto the arid environments of the Madro-tertiary geoflora.\r\n\r\nOf course, information is lacking about climates in several parts of\r\nthe late Miocene and early Pliocene. When such information becomes\r\navailable it conceivably could modify the hypothesis outlined\r\nimmediately above.\r\n\r\nThe principal trend of evolution in these semi-fossorial rodents was\r\ntoward more complete fossorial adaptation, and the pronounced\r\nfossorial features characteristic of the modern pocket gophers were\r\nperfected. This trend continued in response to the intense selection\r\npressures in this arid environment. The principal structural\r\ncharacters effected were in the postcranial anatomy, especially in the\r\nskeletal and muscular systems. Consequently, it is not surprising that\r\nin skull and dentition, _Pliosaccomys_ differs but little from\r\n_Dikkomys_. Therefore, most of the basic structural specializations so\r\nfar developed for subterranean existence probably had evolved by the\r\ntime geomyines moved back north in the early Pliocene. Both modern\r\nlineages, the tribes Thomomyini and Geomyini, have essentially the\r\nsame fossorial features, and it seems unlikely that these features\r\nwere acquired independently in the relatively short period of time\r\navailable to them after their divergence; probably they were inherited\r\nfrom a common ancestor. These probabilities indicate that the\r\nevolution of the fossorial specialization was in the later phyletic\r\ndevelopment of the tribe Dikkomyini.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlio-Pleistocene radiation of Geomyini\r\n\r\nUnlike the lineage of the Thomomyini that remained essentially\r\nrectilinear through out its history, the Geomyini in the late Pliocene\r\nand the early Pleistocene underwent adaptive radiation in a degree\r\ncomparable to the earlier radiation of the Entoptychinae, and all of\r\nthe later history of the tribe is dominated by the radiation--the\r\nresulting structural diversity. At least four lineages were produced\r\nby the Plio-Pleistocene radiation (see Fig. 6); each originated at\r\nessentially the same time (late Pliocene) presumably from the same\r\nancestral stock. Each of these lineages within the Geomyini has given\r\nrise to one of the four modern genera: _Zygogeomys_, _Geomys_,\r\n_Orthogeomys_, and _Pappogeomys_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 6. Plio-Pleistocene radiation of the Tribe\r\n       Geomyini.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morphotype_\r\n\r\nThe immediate, unknown, ancestor probably lived on the Central Plateau\r\nof México. After the radiation began the ancestors of _Geomys_ and\r\n_Zygogeomys_ extended their ranges northward.\r\n\r\nFeatures of the hypothetical morphotype, that would permit derivation\r\nof the modern genera would include the following: (1) Skull\r\ngeneralized, neither excessively long and narrow or short and broad;\r\n(2) skull smoothly rounded, without pronounced angularity, rugosity or\r\ncresting (sagittal crest probably lacking, even in old individuals);\r\n(3) zygomata slender, without lateral platelike expansions; (4)\r\nrostrum moderately broad; (5) upper incisors bisulcate, two grooves in\r\npattern found in _Pliogeomys_, _Zygogeomys_ and _Geomys_; (6) lateral\r\nre-entrant angles of premolars obtuse; (7) p4 having four enamel\r\nplates (one on anterior wall, one on posterior wall, and two lateral\r\nplates) and lower molars having one enamel plate on the posterior wall\r\nof tooth (anterior plate is lacking); (8) P4 having four enamel\r\nplates, in same pattern as described for p4, M1 having two enamel\r\nplates (one anterior and one posterior), M2 same as M1, M3 having\r\nthree plates (one anterior, two lateral on sides of posterior loph,\r\nnone posterior); (9) M3 subtriangular in cross-section, distinctly\r\nbicolumnar, two columns marked by shallow re-entrant folds and\r\nconnected by broad isthmus; (10) masseteric ridge large, forming high\r\ncrest bordering masseteric fossa; (11) basitemporal fossa shallow;\r\n(12) angular process of mandible short, its lateral projection barely\r\nexceeding that of zygomatic arch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Specializations in Genera_\r\n\r\nIn relation to the primitive morphotype, increase in size,\r\nsimplification of dentition, and changes in shape of skull are\r\nregarded as specializations. Considerable parallelism between the four\r\nlineages is seen. But each lineage is distinguished by a combination\r\nof specialized features, and three by a few unique specializations.\r\n\r\nAmong trends resulting in simplification of the dentition, reduction\r\nof enamel on the posterior wall of the upper cheek teeth has occurred\r\nin various degrees in all lineages of the Geomyini even to loss of all\r\nenamel on the posterior wall of the premolars and molars in two\r\ngenera. Loss of some enamel is more common on P4 than on M1-2, and has\r\noccurred in all genera (see Figs. 7 and 9.)\r\n\r\nIn evolutionary sequence loss of enamel from M1 and M2 usually occurs\r\nafter, but never preceding, the reduction of enamel on P4. Loss of\r\nenamel plates from the posterior face of M1 and M2 is associated with\r\nthe evolution of an efficient anterotransverse shearing action of the\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nOn the anterior wall of those teeth no reduction of the cutting blade\r\nhas been observed; a complete anterior plate is retained in all living\r\nGeomyini.\r\n\r\nPresence of both the posterior and anterior plates decreases the\r\nefficiency of transverse shearing, by providing two upper plates\r\n(anterior plate of one tooth and posterior plate of the preceding\r\ntooth) over which the lower cutting blade _simultaneously_ must pass\r\nwith each movement. The advantages of shearing over the more common\r\nmechanics of planing are largely lost unless the posterior plates are\r\neliminated. Also, none of the living Geomyini have retained a\r\ndefinitive posterior enamel plate on M3, the last upper molar; but two\r\nwell-developed lateral plates, that extend almost all of the way back\r\nto the posterior apex of M3, have been retained, and, together\r\nfunction as a posterior plate. Loss of either or both of the lateral\r\nplates of M3 is rare, and occurs only in old individuals. Their loss\r\nin the final stages of wear may represent the beginning of a new trend\r\nin those species where it occurs (the _castanops_-group of the\r\nsubgenus _Cratogeomys_). In any case, reduction of enamel takes place\r\nby transverse shortening of the plate through the complete loss of\r\nenamel on one end, the diminution beginning first on the labial end\r\nand proceeding by progressive atrophy to the lingual end of the plate.\r\nEvidently, when enamel has been eliminated from the labial end of a\r\nplate, the rate of loss decreases markedly, and the last stages of\r\nevolution, terminating in complete loss of an enamel plate, occurs\r\nmore slowly. Evolution may be arrested before complete loss has\r\noccurred, and that part of the enamel that remains forms a short,\r\nvestigial plate restricted to the lingual one-fourth or one-third of\r\nthe wall. The enamel pattern of the lower dentition is the same in all\r\nof the diverging lineages, with no evidence of additional loss of\r\nenamel from that which had already occurred in their common ancestor\r\n(see Figs. 7 and 9). Reduction and loss of enamel plates began and was\r\nterminated in the lower dentition before reduction began in the upper\r\ndentition.\r\n\r\nOther dental specializations have occurred in the shape of the third\r\nupper molar and in the pattern of grooving in the upper incisor.\r\nUnlike M3 of the Thomomyini, that of the Geomyini differs in shape\r\nfrom M2, and its enamel investment differs from that of M2.\r\nPrimitively, M3 was probably subtriangular in cross-section, and the\r\nposterior loph evidently projected posteriorly as a short, rudimentary\r\nheel that formed the apex of the triangle. Other shapes of M3 are\r\nconsidered to be specializations that have been derived from the\r\nprimitive form. In addition to the primitive subtriangular pattern,\r\nthe M3 of living Geomyini may be suborbicular, quadriform, elongate,\r\nor obcordate in shape. Usually each lineage is characterized by only\r\none pattern, but in one genus (_Pappogeomys_) all patterns occur. Of\r\nthe different forms, the elongate and obcordate seem to be the most\r\nhighly specialized deviations from the triangular-shaped tooth. The\r\nbicolumnar pattern is accentuated in the elongate type (Fig. 7D, F, H)\r\nby deep lateral re-entrant folds, on both the lingual and labial\r\nsides, and by the elongation of the posterior loph into a pronounced\r\nheel. Teeth having this pattern have been illustrated by Merriam\r\n(1895:76-82) in Figures 27 (6 and 7), 28 (c and d), 34 (7 through 15),\r\nand 35 (8).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 7.

The\r\nposterior loph apparently has been rotated in such a way that what was\r\npreviously its posterior border now lies on the outer margin of the\r\ntooth; therefore, the axis of the posterior loph is strongly oblique\r\nin relation to the anteroposterior bearing of the maxillary tooth-row,\r\nand the median enamel plate also has been rotated and so lies\r\ntransversely across the posterior wall of the tooth. Owing to the\r\nrotation of the posterior loph, the apex of the obcordate tooth is at\r\nits lingual side. The subcordate type is illustrated by Merriam (_loc.\r\ncit._) in Figures 27 (3 and 4), 28 (a and b), 34 (3 and 4), and 35 (5,\r\n6, and 7). The suborbicular and quadriform types are less specialized\r\nthan the two described above. Both are characterized by reduction,\r\noften obliteration, of the bicolumnar pattern of the subtriangular\r\nancestral form, especially marked by the decrease in depth of the\r\nlateral re-entrant folds and the decrease in length of the posterior\r\nprojection of the posterior loph. With these changes, the tooth\r\nbecomes essentially monocolumnar, its occlusal surface oval in outline\r\nin one and squarish in shape in the other. Occlusal views of the\r\nsuborbicular form are presented by Merriam (_loc. cit._) in Figure 33\r\n(1, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 12) and the quadriform tooth is depicted in\r\nFigure 29. Grooved upper incisors are characteristic of the living\r\nGeomyini, but variation occurs in the number of grooves, and, if only\r\none groove is present, its position on the anterior face of the tooth\r\nvaries. Except for the previously mentioned (p. 480) abnormal tooth\r\nhaving three grooves, incisors with no more than two grooves are found\r\nin these pocket gophers, and this number of grooves is taken to be\r\nprimitive. Loss of one or the other of the two grooves of the\r\nbisulcate pattern, therefore, is regarded as specialization. However,\r\ncomplete loss of both grooves never occurs in the Geomyini. Each of\r\nthe four major lineages is characterized by one of the three patterns\r\nof grooving, and the particular groove-pattern is remarkably stable in\r\neach group.\r\n\r\nShape of skull varies from dolichocephalic to platycephalic. The\r\nmorphology of each has been described in foregoing accounts. The\r\ndolichocephalic skull is highly specialized for planing, a grinding\r\naction of the teeth; whereas, the platycephalic skull is highly\r\nspecialized for shearing, a slicing action of the teeth. Of course,\r\nconcomitant specializations of the dentition, as described above, are\r\nclosely associated with both specialized trends in the skull. Most\r\nkinds of living Geomyini have generalized skulls that show no tendency\r\ntoward either of the specialized conditions.\r\n\r\nIncrease in size of body and skull is seen in most Pleistocene\r\nlineages of the Geomyini. Judging from the smallness of the skull in\r\nlate Pliocene species, representing the base of three of these\r\nlineages, the ancestral species of the living assemblage were no\r\nlarger than the living species of the subgenus _Pappogeomys_ or the\r\nsmaller subspecies of _Geomys bursarius_. The recorded range of\r\nvariation in condylobasal length is 36.1 to 45.5 in _Pappogeomys\r\nbulleri_, including both adult males and females. Probably the skulls\r\nof the ancestral species were not significantly larger. Maximum\r\ndimensions of males in living species are 74.5 (subgenus\r\n_Cratogeomys_) and 75.0 (subgenus _Orthogeomys_). These are more than\r\ntwice the minima observed in _Pappogeomys bulleri_.\r\n\r\n\r\nZygogeomys\r\n\r\nThis is the least specialized and most primitive of the four lineages,\r\nhas a generalized type of skull, two grooves on the anterior face of\r\neach upper incisor, an enamel plate on the posterior wall of P4, open\r\nor divergent lateral re-entrant angles on the premolars, and a\r\nbicolumnar and elongated M3. All of these features are primitive and\r\nessentially as in the ancestral morphotype. No other modern genus\r\nretains so much of the primitive structure. Phyletic trends in\r\n_Zygogeomys_ are not well documented in the fossil record; and only a\r\nfew fossils are known and they are fragmentary as discussed before.\r\nThe genus is represented in the late Pliocene (_Z. minor_), middle\r\nPleistocene (_Z. persimilis_), and Recent (_Z. trichopus_). The living\r\nspecies is a relict population in the mountains of Central México.\r\nJudging from the known material, the phyletic trends in the genus have\r\nbeen increase in size, reduction of enamel on the posterior face of P4\r\n(occurring only in the living species) where a short enamel plate is\r\nretained on the lingual side of the tooth (see Fig. 7B), loss of the\r\nouter fourth of the enamel blade on the posterior wall of M1 and M2\r\n(also occurring only in the living species), development of a more\r\npronounced heel on the M3 by progressive elongation of the posterior\r\nloph, reduction in size of the jugal and its displacement ventrally,\r\nwhich allows the maxillary and squamosal bones to meet along the\r\ndorsal border of the zygomatic arch. The last specialization is seen\r\nin at least one taxon of _Orthogeomys_ (_Orthogeomys cherriei\r\ncostaricensis_). In my opinion, too much weight has been given to this\r\nfeature in past classifications. Reduction of enamel in the upper\r\ndentition evidently occurred in the late Pleistocene, since the\r\nposterior plates on the upper cheek teeth were complete in specimens\r\nfrom the middle Pleistocene (_Z. persimilis_).\r\n\r\n\r\nGeomys\r\n\r\n_Geomys_, slightly more specialized than _Zygogeomys_, must also be\r\nregarded as one of the most primitive of the living genera. Primitive\r\nfeatures that have been retained are the generalized type of skull,\r\nthe bisulcate pattern of grooves on the upper incisor, and the\r\nretention of enamel plates on both the anterior and posterior walls\r\nof M1 and M2 (see Fig. 9A). All of these primitive features are\r\nshared with _Zygogeomys_. In addition, three other trends, or\r\nspecializations, in evolution characterize the phyletic development of\r\n_Geomys_. One major trend is toward loss of the enamel plate from the\r\nposterior wall of P4. No trace of enamel remains on the posterior wall\r\nof this tooth in late Pleistocene or Recent species of _Geomys_, and\r\nat least one of the earlier species (_quinni_) was also characterized\r\nby loss of this enamel plate. Secondly, M3 retains only a vestige of\r\nthe primitive bicolumnar pattern after the initial stages of wear. In\r\nmost Recent specimens, especially of the species _G. bursarius_, the\r\nlateral re-entrant fold and the heel of M3 are small, and the\r\nre-entrant inflection is hardly evident. The lateral fold is more\r\nfrequently well-developed in Irvingtonian species than in living\r\nspecies (White and Downs, 1961:13), illustrating progressive loss of\r\nthe bicolumnar pattern in Pleistocene evolution. A third trend\r\ninvolves the modification of the lateral folds of the premolars.\r\nPrimitively the angles of these folds are broadly open or divergently\r\nV-shaped, and some of the earliest species of _Geomys_, for example\r\n_G. quinni_, have retained this feature throughout life. Nevertheless,\r\nthe main trend is toward progressive compression of the folds\r\nresulting in their walls being more nearly perpendicular, and\r\nparallel, to the long axis of the tooth. Obtuse re-entrant angles\r\npersist in premolars of young individuals of Irvingtonian species, but\r\nthe adults are characterized by well-compressed folds, as in Recent\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nRemains of _Geomys_ are abundant, especially from Pleistocene deposits\r\nof the Great Plains, but in most instances specific assignment is\r\ndifficult or impossible since only isolated teeth or fragments of\r\nskulls have been preserved. Estimates of phyletic relationships of the\r\nknown species of _Geomys_ are depicted in Figure 8; those estimates\r\nare useful in discussing the phyletic development of the genus. One of\r\nthe earliest known species, _Geomys quinni_, ranges from Upper\r\nPliocene to the later stages of the Lower Pleistocene (Aftonian\r\ninterglacial deposits). The dentition of _G. quinni_ is essentially\r\nthe same as in the living species except that open lateral re-entrant\r\nangles are retained in the premolars. _Geomys paenebursarius_, also of\r\nthe early Pleistocene, is a smaller species and seems to be more\r\ndirectly in the line of evolution of the modern species. As yet\r\nunnamed smaller species of _Geomys_ from the Rexroad fauna (late\r\nPliocene) and Saunders fauna (latest Aftonian) may also be on the main\r\nline of evolution. Surprisingly, _Geomys tobinensis_ and _Geomys\r\ngarbanii_ of later Irvingtonian provincial age are less specialized\r\nthan either _Geomys quinni_ or _Geomys paenebursarius_. It is likely\r\nthat _G. tobinensis_ and the unnamed species from the Dixon are closer\r\nto the main line of descent than _G. paenebursarius_ suggesting that\r\nthe direct ancestral lineage of the living species of _Geomys_ was\r\nmore conservative and less specialized than _Geomys paenebursarius_ of\r\nthe Lower Pleistocene. _Geomys quinni_ and _G. paenebursarius_ seem to\r\nhave acquired specialized dental features in the early Pleistocene.\r\n_Geomys quinni_ was successful on the Great Plains, and persisted into\r\nthe late Blancan. The main line may be represented in the early\r\nPleistocene by _Geomys paenebursarius_ from the Hancock formation of\r\nthe Texas Trans-Pecos. The structure of _G. paenebursarius_ indicates\r\nthat it is in or close to the main line of descent, and probably\r\nevolved from one of the more primitive late Pliocene species of\r\n_Geomys_ from the Rexroad fauna.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 8. Tentative arrangement of species of the genus\r\n       _Geomys_, depicting phylogenetic trends and probable relationships\r\n       within the genus.]\r\n\r\nIsolated teeth, to which the name _Geomys bisulcatus_ probably\r\napplies, from Illinoian deposits on the Great Plains, show that the\r\ndentition characteristic of the living _Geomys_ had been developed by\r\nthat time. Actually, the Illinoian material is too fragmentary to\r\nshow clearly its taxonomic or phyletic affinities with the species of\r\nthe later Pleistocene. Even so, the two main stocks of living\r\n_Geomys_, _G. bursarius_ and _G. pinetis_, had certainly been\r\ndifferentiated by Sangamon time. The other living species evidently\r\nevolved from one or the other of these two stocks in a period of\r\nisolation from the main population, probably in either the Wisconsin\r\nor post-Wisconsin. For example, _Geomys arenarius_ clearly\r\ndifferentiated from populations of _Geomys bursarius_ that were\r\nisolated by the eastward retreat of the main population from the\r\nsouthwestern United States as that region became more arid in the\r\npost-Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nIn review, it seems that the Recent species, represented basically by\r\n_bursarius_ and _pinetis_, evolved from Illinoian species (_Geomys\r\nbisulcatus?_), which descended in turn from the more primitive species\r\nof the early Pleistocene, possibly _Geomys paenebursarius_ or possibly\r\nfrom descendants of the Saunders species. Actually the Saunders\r\nspecies may prove to be _Geomys paenebursarius_. At any rate, three\r\ntrends that took place during the Pleistocene stage of evolution, in\r\nthe direction of the modern species, were an increase in size,\r\nprogressive loss of the posterior enamel plate on P4, and a decrease\r\nin the vertical depth of the enamel cap as a result of which the\r\ndentine is reached in the initial phases of attrition on the tooth of\r\na juvenile. _Geomys garbanii_, occurring at the periphery of the range\r\nof the genus, is regarded as a sterile offshoot of the primitive\r\n_tobinensis_-line of evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrthogeomys\r\n\r\nThis is one of the more specialized genera of the Geomyini. Save for\r\none record in the late Pleistocene (_Orthogeomys onerosus_), there is\r\nno fossil history of the genus upon which to reconstruct its\r\nphylogeny; therefore, its phyletic development must be estimated by\r\ncomparing it and the primitive morphotype of the tribe. Results of\r\nthat comparison suggest that _Orthogeomys_ has closer affinities with\r\n_Zygogeomys_ than with any of the other genera, and that _Orthogeomys_\r\nmay have originated in an early dichotomy of primitive _Zygogeomys_\r\nstock instead of descending from the ancestral stock of the tribe.\r\nExcept for the unisulcate incisors and the longer posterior loph on\r\nthe third upper molars, the teeth of the two genera do not differ\r\nsignificantly. As in _Zygogeomys_, the enamel blade on the posterior\r\nwall of P4 has been reduced to a short plate restricted to the lingual\r\nthird of the tooth (see Fig. 7F and H). In _Orthogeomys_, the trend in\r\nreduction of enamel is carried to its extreme only in the subgenus\r\n_Orthogeomys_, where this plate has been completely lost in most taxa\r\n(see Fig. 7D). The most significant trends in _Orthogeomys_, and the\r\nprincipal basis for recognizing the genus, are the dolichocephalic\r\nspecializations of the skull, as described elsewhere, and the adaptive\r\ntraits that have equipped the genus for living in tropical\r\nenvironments. The dolichocephalic features are more sharply defined in\r\nthe subgenera _Orthogeomys_ and _Macrogeomys_, and are less developed\r\nin the subgenus _Heterogeomys_. Aside from the general dolichocephalic\r\nspecializations, trends in _Orthogeomys_ include: Increase in size;\r\nloss of the median one of the two grooves on the anterior face of the\r\nupper incisor in the ancestral stock; increase in the anteroposterior\r\nlength of each of the cheek teeth, as well as the aforementioned\r\nelongation of the posterior loph of M3; compression of the lateral\r\nangles of the premolars; and the remarkable increase in the size of\r\nthe rostrum.\r\n\r\n\r\nPappogeomys\r\n\r\nThe genus _Pappogeomys_, as it is conceived of in this study, is\r\ncomprised of two subgenera; one, _Pappogeomys_, is generalized and\r\nprimitive, and the other, _Cratogeomys_, is specialized, and includes\r\nthe most highly specialized of the modern pocket gophers. The subgenus\r\n_Pappogeomys_ is regarded as the ancestral lineage, and the subgenus\r\n_Cratogeomys_ is regarded as an early offshoot, probably in the early\r\nPleistocene, that became progressively more specialized in the course\r\nof its subsequent evolution. In the same period of time, the subgenus\r\n_Pappogeomys_ changed little. It is known only from late Pliocene\r\nfragments and from the living species. The ancestral morphotype is\r\npreserved in _Pappogeomys_. Primitive characters are: (1) Small size;\r\n(2) skull generalized and smoothly rounded; (3) temporal ridges\r\nseparate (not uniting into a sagittal crest); (4) enamel plates\r\nretained on both anterior and posterior walls of M1 and M2; (5) M3\r\nbilophate, its posterior loph short. Basic specializations are few and\r\ninclude loss of the inner groove from the anterior face of the upper\r\nincisor; anteroposterior compression of the lateral re-entrant folds\r\nof the premolars; and loss of enamel from the posterior wall of P4.\r\nAll three features have been perpetuated in the advanced subgenus\r\n_Cratogeomys_, suggesting that they were already developed in the\r\nearly evolution of the subgenus _Pappogeomys_ before _Cratogeomys_\r\ndiverged. Agreement with _Geomys_ is demonstrated by the lack of\r\nenamel on the posterior wall of P4 (see Fig. 9) and by retention of\r\nthe posterior enamel plate on M1 and M2. In _Pappogeomys (Pappogeomys)\r\nalcorni_ the enamel from the posterior face of M1 has been lost from\r\nall but the lingual fourth or so of the posterior wall (Fig. 9E).\r\nReduction of enamel in M1 provides an example of parallelism with the\r\nmore advanced subgenus _Cratogeomys_, discussed below.\r\n\r\nThere is no record as yet of the early evolution of the subgenus\r\n_Cratogeomys_. The features that characterize the subgenus were\r\nalready well developed in the first known fossils which are from\r\nWisconsin deposits of the late Pleistocene. _Cratogeomys_ is not a\r\nhomogenous assemblage; instead it is composed of two groups of living\r\nspecies, the generalized _castanops_ group and the specialized\r\n_gymnurus_ group. The _castanops_ group may be survivors of the\r\nancestral lineage that diverged in two different stages in the\r\nphyletic development of the main line. Even so, the _castanops_ group\r\nhas acquired its peculiar specializations. Indeed, _P. merriami_ of\r\nthe _castanops_ group differs from the hypothetical stem more than\r\ndoes _P. castanops_. Judging from the structure of the living species\r\nof the subgenus _Cratogeomys_ and from the primitive subgenus\r\n_Pappogeomys_, the subgenus _Cratogeomys_ featured five major trends:\r\n(1) Increase in size; (2) formation of sagittal crest by union of the\r\ntemporal impressions; (3) increase in rugosity and angularity of the\r\nskull; (4) progressive development of platycephalic specializations,\r\nincluding the elongation of the angular process of the mandible; (5)\r\ncomplete loss of enamel plates from the posterior wall of M1 and M2.\r\nEach trend is thought to be adaptive.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 9.

Left upper (G), P4-M3; right lower (H), p4-m3.\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nLoss of enamel is a trend common to all living genera of the tribe\r\nGeomyini, but the greatest loss has occurred in _Cratogeomys_. It has\r\nlost the plates on the posterior walls of M1 and M2 (Fig. 9G). If the\r\nlateral plates of M3 are considered as one functional plate and the\r\nlateral plates on either side of P4 together as two transverse plates,\r\nthen, the transverse cutting blades in _Cratogeomys_ number seven in\r\nthe upper and seven in the lower cheek teeth compared with 10 in the\r\nupper and seven in the lower in the primitive morphotype. Indeed, in\r\nsome species of the subgenus, one or both of the lateral plates on M3\r\nis also lost, usually in old age, resulting in even greater reduction\r\nof enamel. Loss of enamel from the posterior walls of the upper\r\nmolars may be associated with changes in the mechanics of mastication\r\nfrom anteroposterior planing to anterotransverse shearing, as\r\ndiscussed elsewhere. Merriam (1895:95-96) argues convincingly that the\r\nposterior cutting blades of the upper molars would hinder efficient\r\nshearing action of the teeth; hence, selection would favor their\r\nreduction and eventual loss. Changes in the shape of the skull also\r\nseem to be correlated with the shift from a planing to a shearing type\r\nof mastication. More efficient shearing action, which depends upon\r\nlateral movement of the jaw, can be developed if the functional\r\nmuscles insert farther laterally than is possible in the generalized\r\ntype of skull. Therefore, platycephalic specializations involved\r\nlateral expansion of the braincase and mandible. Pronounced lateral\r\nexpansion has been developed only in the _gymnurus_ group of species,\r\nsuggesting that the dental specializations evolved earlier in the\r\nevolution of the subgenus than did the platycephalic specializations\r\nof the skull, and that the _castanops_ group separated from the\r\n_gymnurus_ group before the common ancestor had developed the more\r\nextreme trends in platycephaly. It is interesting to note that the\r\nsubtriangular M3 (Fig. 9G) postulated for the ancestral morphotype and\r\nthat characterizes the subgenus _Pappogeomys_ is retained also in the\r\n_gymnurus_ group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\n\r\nALSTON, E.
