Most people\r\nknow that in our own country the monks had stew ponds, where they kept\r\nfish, principally carp, and also that the Romans kept fish in ponds. In\r\nthe latter case we hear more often of the eel than of other fish. The\r\nbreeding of trout and salmon, and the artificial spawning and hatching\r\nof ova, are, however, an innovation of our own time.\r\n\r\nMuch has been discovered about the procreation of fish, and in no case\r\nhave scientists worked so hard and discovered more than in the case of\r\n_Salmonidæ_. Fish culture, particularly trout culture, has become a\r\ntrade, and a paying one. To any one who has the least idea of the\r\ndifficulties to be overcome in rearing _Salmonidæ_, this fact alone\r\nproves that fish culture must have progressed to a very advanced stage\r\nas a science.\r\n\r\nThis advance has in very many, if not in the majority of cases, been\r\nmade by the bitter experience gained through failures and mishaps, for\r\nthese have led fish culturists to try many different means to prevent\r\nmischances, or to rectify them if they have happened. Some of the most\r\nserious difficulties experienced by the early fish culturists who bred\r\n_Salmonidæ_ can now be almost disregarded, for they hardly exist for the\r\nmodern fish culturist, with the knowledge he possesses of the experience\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nSo much of what has been done in fish culture is generally known to\r\nthose who have studied and practised it, that the beginner can nowadays\r\ncommence far ahead of the point whence the first fish culturists\r\nstarted. Many of his difficulties have been overcome for him already,\r\nand though he will not, of course, meet with the success of the man of\r\nexperience, still he ought with the exercise of an average amount of\r\nintelligence to avoid such failures as would completely disgust him.\r\n\r\nThere are many pieces of water containing nothing but coarse fish which\r\nare very suitable for trout of some kind. Ponds, particularly those\r\nwhich have a stream running through them, will, as a rule, support a\r\ngood head of trout if properly managed. Again a water which contains\r\ntrout may become more or less depleted, and here it is necessary to\r\nsupply the deficiency of trout by some means. The easiest way is, of\r\ncourse, to buy yearling or two-year-old fish from a piscicultural\r\nestablishment, of which there are many in the kingdom, but I know that\r\nthere are many fishermen who would much prefer to rear their own fish\r\nfrom the ova, than to buy ready-made fish. Any one who has the time and\r\nopportunity to rear his own fish will be amply repaid by the amusement\r\nand interest gained, and it should be the cheaper method of stocking or\r\nre-stocking a water.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks apply to a certain extent to waters which will not\r\nsupport trout, or where the owner wants more coarse fish. The stock of\r\ncoarse fish may be improved by fish culture just as much as a stock of\r\ntrout.\r\n\r\nIn his first year or two, it is very possible that the amateur will not\r\nsave very much by being his own pisciculturist. If, however, he is\r\ncareful, and works with intelligence, it is quite possible that he may\r\nsucceed better than he had hoped and rear a good head of fish at a less\r\ncost than the purchase of yearlings. In any case he will have had a\r\ngreat deal of pleasure and gained experience as well as reared some\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nIn the present little volume, I propose to try and deal with fish\r\nculture in such a way as to help the amateur who wishes to rear fish to\r\nstock his own water. Much of the existing literature of the subject\r\ndeals with it on such a large scale that the amateur is frightened to\r\nattempt what is apparently so huge an undertaking. Fish culture may,\r\nhowever, be carried out on a small scale with success, and though\r\nconsiderable attention is necessary, particularly with young\r\n_Salmonidæ_, it is not a task which involves a very great proportion of\r\nthe time of any one undertaking it. It is absolutely necessary, however,\r\nthat the amateur fish culturist should live on the spot, or have some\r\none who is intelligent and perfectly trustworthy who does. In every case\r\nin my experience, trusting the care of young fish to a keeper or servant\r\nhas resulted in failure, and in every failure I have seen where the fish\r\nhave not been trusted to the care of a servant, the cause has been very\r\nobvious, and could easily have been avoided.\r\n\r\nThe rearing of trout is the most important branch of fish culture to the\r\namateur, and fortunately but slight modifications are necessary in\r\nrearing other fish. What is good enough for trout is good enough for\r\nmost fish, therefore I think that I shall be right in describing trout\r\nculture at considerable length, and dealing with other fish in a\r\nsomewhat summary manner. The difference in the management, etc., of\r\nother fish I shall point out after describing how to rear trout.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the amateur must not suppose that because he puts fish\r\ninto a stream or pond he will succeed in stocking that water or\r\nincreasing the head of fish. There are many other things to be\r\nconsidered. The river, stream, or pond must be of a suitable character\r\nfor the fish, and there must be plenty of food. I am sure that it is\r\nmuch more important to consider carefully whether the water is suitable,\r\nand contains a proper supply of food, than to consider how the fish are\r\nto be obtained, for recourse may always be had to a professional fish\r\nculturist--fish of almost any kind and any age can be bought ready\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe point I would impress upon the amateur more forcibly than anything\r\nelse, is that he should be sure that there is plenty for his fish to eat\r\nin the water, before he thinks of putting them into it. It is for this\r\nreason that I devote my next chapter chiefly to the stocking of waters\r\nwith food and to the improvement of the food supply in waters where some\r\nfood already exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSTOCKING WATERS WITH FOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may seem somewhat superfluous to say that fish cannot live in any\r\nwater unless that water contains the food supply necessary for them to\r\nthrive upon, and yet this is the point most often overlooked in stocking\r\nwaters with fish. Small attempts at stocking with creatures suitable for\r\nfood, particularly after the fish have been already introduced, are not\r\nat all likely to succeed. Such an important matter when treated as a\r\nsmall afterthought is almost sure to end in failure of the whole\r\nbusiness of stocking.\r\n\r\nBut a small amount of thought will convince any one that in order that\r\nthere may be a sufficient amount of animal life in a water, there must\r\nbe an adequate vegetable life, for weeds are almost always necessary to\r\nthe well-being of the creatures which serve as food for fishes.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a pond it is generally fairly easy to introduce a good\r\nstock of suitable weeds. The best method is to let the pond down as low\r\nas possible, and then to plant some weeds round the margin; the water is\r\nthen allowed to gradually fill up the pond, and as it rises weeds are\r\nplanted round the rising margin of the water. In ponds which cannot be\r\nemptied at all, or not sufficiently to carry out this plan, weeds may be\r\nplanted in an easy but not quite so effectual a manner. They may be\r\nplanted in shallow baskets containing some mud from the bottom of the\r\npond, and then lowered in suitable places from a boat, or bundles of the\r\nweed may be tied to stones and dropped into the water in a similar\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThese latter methods are, of course, not so good as actually planting\r\nthe weeds round the advancing margin of the water, for success depends\r\nto a certain extent upon chance. Some of the weeds thus planted are,\r\nhowever, sure to take root and grow. Plants of different kinds, of\r\ncourse, are necessary at different depths and on different kinds of\r\nbottoms, and good kinds are necessary at the margin of the water as\r\nwell. I give a list of some suitable plants of each kind at the end of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nSimilar methods are used in planting weeds in rivers and streams to\r\nthose used in ponds. If the weeds are planted in baskets, the baskets\r\nmust, of course, be weighted when put in a position where the current\r\ncan act upon them.\r\n\r\nBesides vegetation in the water, vegetation on the bank is of\r\nconsiderable importance. I shall deal with this at a later period more\r\nfully, as trees and bushes, besides harbouring many insects which serve\r\nas food for fish, have also considerable importance in giving cover to\r\nthe fish and to the fisherman who is pursuing them.\r\n\r\nI think that in the case of a bare water, a year at least should be\r\ndevoted to developing a good supply of vegetation. This will generally\r\nproduce a considerable amount of animal life, without any artificial\r\nhelp, but judicious help will be sure to accelerate matters to a\r\nconsiderable extent. I would, however, advise the amateur not to attempt\r\nto introduce a quantity of creatures into his water, until the vegetable\r\nlife therein is well established. For instance, though fresh-water\r\nsnails are desirable in every trout water, if introduced in large\r\nnumbers into a water in which the vegetation is small and not well\r\nestablished, they will eat down the weeds too much and then die off from\r\ndisease caused by want of sufficient nourishment.\r\n\r\nHaving established the vegetable life well in a water, and developed it\r\nto a considerable extent, the amateur may begin to examine his water,\r\nand find out how much animal life exists there, and to stock with\r\ncreatures suitable for food, according to what he finds in the water.\r\n\r\nFresh-water snails are always desirable. In streams, or in ponds with\r\nstreams running into them, the fresh-water shrimps (_Gammarus pulex_)\r\nshould always be tried. It does not do in some waters, but where it does\r\nthrive it increases very rapidly, and forms about the best article of\r\nfood that can be given to trout. _Corixæ_, which thrive in ponds and\r\nsluggish waters, should always be introduced. They increase rapidly, and\r\nare taken by most fish, particularly by trout. The amateur should be\r\ncareful when he introduces these creatures to make sure that he is\r\nputting in the right creature. The water-boatman (_Nautonecta glauca_)\r\nis a member of the same family, but is no use as food for the fish. He\r\nswims on his back, is longer and narrower than are _Corixæ_, which do\r\nnot swim on their backs, are smaller, broader, and live much more under\r\nwater than the water-boatman. It is generally advisable to avoid\r\nwater-beetles, as most of them are more likely to do harm than good,\r\nsuch a number of our water-beetles being carnivorous. They will probably\r\nnot harm adult fish, but they will destroy ova and fry. I have known a\r\n_Dytiscus marginalis_ kill a trout of nearly a quarter of a pound in\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure of not introducing carnivorous water-beetles into\r\na water, I think it best as a rule not to introduce beetles at all.\r\n_Corixæ_ are, however, so like beetles, that many people call them\r\nbeetles, and therefore I will give a few points which will make them\r\neasily distinguishable from each other. In beetles, the wing-cases\r\n(elytra) meet exactly in the middle line, in _Corixæ_ and other\r\nwater-bugs, the anterior wings, which resemble the elytra of beetles,\r\noverlap, which causes the line on the back to curve away to one side at\r\nthe lower end. In beetles the wings which lie under the wing-cases are\r\nfolded up on themselves, and when spread out are much larger than the\r\nwing-cases. The wings are transparent and very delicate. In _Corixæ_ the\r\nposterior wings, which lie under the hard and horny anterior wings, are\r\na little shorter than the anterior wings; they are not folded up on\r\nthemselves and are not so delicate and transparent as the wings of the\r\nbeetle.\r\n\r\nSuch small creatures as _Daphnia pulex_, _Cyclops quadricornis_ and\r\n_Rotifera_ should be introduced into ponds.\r\n\r\nSnails (_Gasteropoda_) may be roughly divided into three classes,\r\naccording to the shape of their shells: (1) Flat-shaped coils (type\r\n_Planorbis corneus_); (2) Oblong-shaped, somewhat like a trumpet (type\r\n_Limnæa stagnalis_); and (3) Ear-shaped (type _Limnæa auricularia_).\r\n_Limnæa auricularia_ is particularly suitable for deep waters, and _L.\r\npereger_, whose shell is of type 2, is a most valuable addition to the\r\nfood supply in any fish pond. It is one of the commonest of our\r\nfresh-water snails.\r\n\r\nMussels (_Conchifera_) are another valuable article of food. There are a\r\ngreat many different kinds, and the larger ones should, as a rule, be\r\navoided. _Sphæriidæ_ and _Pisidia_ are probably the best.\r\n\r\nIn many cases it is advisable to attempt the introduction of some flies\r\nwhich are not present. There are several cases in which the May-fly has\r\nbeen successfully introduced, and also the Grannom. Small _Ephemeridæ_\r\nseem to me preferable to any other flies.\r\n\r\nWith regard to suitable plants for comparatively deep water in ponds or\r\nlakes, lakewort and stonewort grow on the bottom, and do not, as a rule,\r\nattain any considerable height. White and yellow water-lilies also grow\r\nin fairly deep water; the water-lobelia is also an excellent plant for\r\nponds.\r\n\r\nIn streams some of the best plants are water-crowfoot, water-starwort,\r\nand the great water moss. Anacharis should not be introduced into any\r\nwater, either pond or stream, unless it can be kept down easily. It will\r\notherwise become an unmitigated nuisance.\r\n\r\nMarginal plants are a very important consideration, and plenty of them\r\nshould be grown. Water-celery and water-cress are perhaps the best\r\nfood-producing marginal plants that can be grown. Bullrushes and\r\nbrooklime are also good, but the bullrushes must be planted\r\njudiciously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSUITABLE FISH AND SUITABLE WATERS\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving stocked his water with suitable vegetation and food, the next\r\nmatter which should engage the attention of the amateur, is what fish he\r\nhad better introduce. He should, where there is a fair chance of\r\nsuccess, introduce a trout of some sort, as they give better sport than\r\ncoarse fish.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of salmon into a river is not likely to be attempted by\r\nthe amateur, but the head of salmon frequenting a river is undoubtedly\r\naffected in the most marvellous manner by artificial means. In Canada\r\nand the United States this is particularly remarkable, but the\r\noperations are conducted on a gigantic scale.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a stream or river where brown trout already exist, or\r\nhave recently existed, in fair numbers, re-stock with these fish, for\r\nthey can hardly be bettered in our waters. There are, however, some\r\nsluggish rivers where brown trout do not thrive when they are\r\nintroduced. In such rivers and in many ponds in the South of England I\r\nbelieve that no better fish exists than the rainbow trout. I say\r\nparticularly in the south, because I do not think that the rainbow trout\r\nwill ever really thrive and breed in cold waters. I have at other times\r\ngiven numerous examples which go to show that the rainbow will only\r\nthrive in warm waters.[1] I will therefore only quote the case of New\r\nZealand. The rainbow trout was introduced into both islands, but while\r\nit thrived amazingly in the warm waters of the North Island, it has\r\nproved a comparative failure in the cold waters of the South Island.\r\n\r\n[1] _The Rainbow Trout._ Lawrence & Bullen, London.\r\n\r\nWhile the common or brown trout (_Salmo fario_) and the rainbow trout\r\n(_Salmo irideus_) are, in my opinion, to be strongly encouraged in the\r\nwaters suitable to their respective qualities, the American brook trout\r\n(_Salvelinus fontinalis_) does not seem to have met with the approval of\r\nmost of the authorities on pisciculture in this country. My experience\r\nof this fish is not sufficient for my holding any very strong views with\r\nregard to its suitability to British waters. In one case I know that it\r\nwas a great success for two seasons, but I have not had any opportunity\r\nof following it up in this particular instance. In another case it was a\r\ndecided failure. I am sure that it should not be introduced into streams\r\nwhere brown trout thrive, and I am doubtful of its ever succeeding in\r\nwaters which are suitable to the rainbow trout.\r\n\r\nOf all the trout, the rainbow is the hardiest, and the one with which\r\nthe amateur pisciculturist is most likely to be successful. It is also\r\nthe fish most likely to supply a want felt by very many fishermen, a\r\ngood sporting fish in waters where the common trout will not thrive.\r\n\r\nIn large and deep ponds with a good stream, or in lakes, char may be\r\ntried with a prospect of success. They require cold waters, and I have\r\nnever heard of their being successfully introduced in the South of\r\nEngland. They are a more difficult fish to rear than trout.\r\n\r\nGrayling have many violent opponents, but I am inclined to think that\r\nthey do but little if any harm in a trout stream, and they supply\r\nexcellent fishing during part of the close season for trout. They seem\r\nto thrive best in chalk streams, but there are no doubt many waters\r\nwhich would carry a good head of grayling which at present contain only\r\ntrout. They probably do much less harm than most of the coarse fish\r\nconstantly found in trout streams. The great crime attributed to them is\r\nthat they eat the spawn of the trout, but I am inclined to think that\r\nthe harm they do in this way is much over estimated. They spawn at a\r\ndifferent time and would not be likely to frequent the spawning places\r\nat the same time as the trout. I have no doubt that an infinitely\r\ngreater proportion of trout ova are eaten by the trout themselves than\r\nby grayling in rivers which contain both fish. Chalk streams and those\r\nrivers with gravelly bottoms and with alternate shallows and pools seem\r\nto be the most suited to the grayling.\r\n\r\nAmong coarse fish the rudd is one of the best from the fly-fisher's\r\npoint of view. It takes the fly readily, is very prolific and very easy\r\nto introduce. It thrives remarkably well in ponds which contain a good\r\nsupply of food. Its fry serve as excellent food for other fish,\r\nparticularly trout, but I have known cases where it increased rapidly in\r\na pond at the expense of the trout. It can, however, be kept under by\r\njudicious netting.\r\n\r\nThe dace is another fish which gives sport to the fly-fisherman. It will\r\nnot thrive in ponds. In some rivers, however, where trout--brown trout,\r\nat any rate--will not thrive, the dace does very well. In the case of\r\nthe Sussex Ouse this is most remarkable. Little more than ten years ago\r\nthere were no dace in that river, now it swarms with them. Their\r\npresence is attributed to the fact that some dace, brought there as\r\nlive-baits for pike, escaped destruction and established the present\r\nstock. Sluggish and muddy rivers seem to produce the best dace. Chubb,\r\nwhich also possess many points to recommend them to the fisherman, will\r\nalso do well in such rivers.\r\n\r\nTo those who enjoy bottom fishing and possess a pond, even a small one,\r\nI can recommend no fish more highly than the king-carp. It is a much\r\nbolder-feeding and gamer fish than the common carp, and is just as easy\r\nto introduce. While dealing with carp I may mention that the goldfish,\r\nwhen introduced into a suitable pond, grows to a very large size. I have\r\ncaught them over a pound in weight.\r\n\r\nThe perch is a very prolific fish, and will thrive in ponds with a very\r\nsmall stream running into them, and in sluggish rivers. Other coarse\r\nfish are as a rule easy to introduce into a water. Though perch fry form\r\nexcellent food for trout, perch, and of course pike, should be kept out\r\nof a trout water.\r\n\r\nThe suitability of a water depends to a great extent (as to its capacity\r\nof supporting a healthy stock of fish) upon its having plenty of\r\nsuitable vegetation upon the banks. Therefore if the banks are bare of\r\nvegetation, willows and alders, as being quick growing and easily\r\nestablished trees, should be freely planted upon the banks. This\r\nfortunately is very easily done, for willow and alder sticks cut and put\r\ninto the ground in the spring are pretty sure to do well. It is needless\r\nto say that the moister spots should be chosen for the willows, though\r\nthey will do well in suitable soil in comparatively dry places. Besides\r\ngiving shade and shelter to the fish, which is always an important\r\nconsideration, a considerable quantity of food is bred upon trees and\r\nshrubs at the water side. I have found as many as eighteen caterpillars\r\nin the stomach of a trout which I caught under an overhanging oak tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTROUT. PRELIMINARY HINTS AND ADVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amateur who is beginning trout culture had better by all means buy\r\neyed ova from a fish cultural establishment. There are many of these in\r\nthe British Isles, and nowadays eyed ova are packed and sent safely all\r\nover the country. The artificial spawning of trout is not an undertaking\r\nin which the beginner is likely to achieve great success, and therefore\r\nI should advise him to avoid relying upon it when he commences his\r\noperations as a fish culturist.\r\n\r\nCollecting the ova of wild trout is also an operation of some\r\ndifficulty, and lays the beginner open to much more disappointment than\r\nif he deals with eyed ova purchased from a reliable establishment.\r\nInstead of having to watch and care for the ova through a critical and\r\ndangerous period, he receives them shortly before the young fish hatch\r\nout, when the ova are not in the most delicate stage.\r\n\r\nIt is of the greatest importance that everything should be ready for the\r\nova long before they are expected, as hurry and new apparatus are likely\r\nto cause failure. Any concrete and varnished or enamelled woodwork\r\nshould be exposed to the action of a current of water for at least five\r\nor six weeks before they are brought into actual use.\r\n\r\nThe choice of a suitable spot in which to make his hatchery is a serious\r\npoint for the consideration of the amateur. A spring is the best water\r\nsupply as a rule, for the water is usually of a fairly even temperature,\r\nand does not require filtering, but water from a stream where trout are\r\nknown to live is quite safe. A few years ago it would have been\r\nnecessary for any one wishing to take up fish culture, to erect a\r\nbuilding in which to place his hatchery if he intended to hatch any\r\nnumber of eggs, in order to guard against frosts. At the present time,\r\nthe eyed ova of even the brown trout (_Salmo fario_) can be obtained\r\nsufficiently late to be safe against a frost severe enough to cause any\r\ndamage, and as the rainbow trout (_Salmo irideus_) spawns in February\r\nand March, the amateur is, at the time he receives the eyed ova, quite\r\nsafe from frost.\r\n\r\nThe best method to pursue is to make long narrow ponds, with a current\r\nrunning through them, and to hatch the eggs out in trays and boxes\r\nsuspended in these ponds. When the young fish hatch out, the trays which\r\ncontained the ova can be removed, and the young fish kept in the boxes.\r\nLater on the young fish can be released from the boxes into the ponds. I\r\nshall subsequently describe how these ponds, trays, and boxes should be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe rearing ponds should be made, if possible, at a fall in the level of\r\nthe water supply, so that they may be easily emptied. This is an\r\nimportant point which is frequently overlooked by amateurs. There should\r\nbe an outlet on a level with the bottom of the pond, and if the water\r\nescapes through a pipe, that pipe should incline downwards. This, in a\r\nseries of ponds, of course necessitates the ponds being at different\r\nlevels, but the water is thus under much better control than if the\r\noutlet is at a higher level, and the ponds are easily emptied. Ponds\r\nmay, however, be worked successfully with the outlet in mid-water, or\r\neven near the surface, though this does not ensure such a certainty of\r\nchange of water throughout the pond. It is not, however, always possible\r\nto obtain such a difference in level between the supply and waste. In\r\nsuch cases the ponds should be made shallower near the outlet.\r\n\r\nA popular idea seems to be that a gravel bottom is necessary for the\r\nwell-being of trout; this is quite a mistake. Personally, I believe that\r\na good earth bottom is best in a rearing pond, and even in a pond lined\r\nwith concrete I should always put a layer of mould, preferably turf\r\nmould, at the bottom. With the use of this mould during the subsequent\r\noperations in rearing trout I shall deal later on.\r\n\r\nThe size of the ponds, of course, depends upon the number of trout to be\r\nreared. It is better to have several medium sized ponds than one large\r\none, as then accident or disease occurring in a pond will only affect a\r\nportion of the stock of fish. Mr. J. J. Armistead in _An Angler's\r\nParadise, and How to Obtain It_, says: \"A pond sixty feet long, four\r\nfeet wide, and about three feet deep, will hold ten or fifteen thousand\r\nfry at first, and give them plenty of room to grow, but by the end of\r\nJuly the number should be reduced to five thousand, which may be left\r\ntill October, when they should again be thinned out, or, better still,\r\nput into larger pond.\"\r\n\r\nI should advise the amateur who is dealing with only a few thousand fish\r\nto work on a smaller scale in these proportions, and to make these\r\nchanges gradually, and yet more gradually as the season advances. That\r\nis to say, work with a third of the number of fry in ponds half the size\r\nand move some fish several times before the end of July. As October\r\napproaches, make changes of smaller numbers of fish more frequently.\r\n\r\nLate in the autumn is, in my opinion, the best time to put the young\r\nfish into the water they are to inhabit permanently. It must be a\r\nmistake to rear them artificially longer than is necessary, and by the\r\nend of November they should be fairly capable of looking after\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nTrout, which are artificially reared on chopped meat and other soft\r\nfoods, suffer from a lack of development in the stomach walls, and also,\r\nprobably, in the rest of their digestive apparatus. The first case I saw\r\nof the stomach of an artificially reared trout was a two-year-old\r\ntrout, upon which Dr. C. S. Patterson performed an autopsy. The stomach\r\nwalls were as thin as a sheet of tissue paper. At the time I believed,\r\nand, if I remember rightly, he also thought that this was due to\r\natrophy, but I am inclined to think that this idea was only partially\r\ncorrect. The stomach walls of the autumn yearling trout, which is\r\nartificially reared on soft food, do not show any marked abnormality in\r\nthe way of thinness; but as the trout's age increases, so does the\r\nthickness of the stomach wall decrease in proportion to its size. This\r\nleads me to believe that the development of the stomach wall, at any\r\nrate, and probably also of the glands secreting the gastric juice and\r\nthe digestive apparatus generally, gradually ceases when at about the\r\nage of eight or nine months if the trout is fed upon soft food.\r\nProbably, also, a certain amount of atrophy and dilatation of the\r\nstomach wall is produced. If my observations are correct, so also is the\r\nconclusion that a trout which cannot digest hard food, of which a great\r\npart of his natural food consists, will not have a really fair chance\r\nwhen turned out. Therefore, I say, turn out your trout in November,\r\nunless you can feed them on such food as shrimps, snails, bivalves and\r\n_Corixæ_; and if you stock with \"ready made\" fish, stock with yearlings\r\nin the late autumn.\r\n\r\nThe turning out of his fish in November will also allow the amateur\r\nplenty of time to prepare his ponds and apparatus for next year's\r\noperations. If the ponds are made on a stream, probably the very best\r\nplace that can be chosen is where there is a fairly sharp bend in the\r\nstream just below a fall. An artificial fall can often be made where the\r\nbanks are high by damming up the stream several feet. Care must be\r\ntaken, however, to avoid any risk of the ponds being flooded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTROUT. REARING PONDS, BOXES, AND HATCHING TRAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving decided upon a suitable spot, the amateur must now proceed to\r\nmake his ponds. Whether he derive his water supply from a spring or from\r\na stream, the amateur had better bring it into his ponds through a pipe.\r\nA three-inch pipe will be large enough for a pond thirty feet long,\r\nthree feet wide, and two feet deep at the deepest part. It is a good\r\nthing for the water to fall, some inches at any rate, through the air\r\nbefore it reaches the pond, and in a series of ponds with only one\r\nsupply, the water should flow through an open trough with stones and\r\nother impediments in it, between the ponds. The ponds may be lined\r\nentirely with brickwork faced with cement, and in this case the sides\r\nshould be made perpendicular. The cement should, however, be exposed\r\nfreely to the action of the running water for a couple of months at\r\nleast before any ova or fry are introduced.\r\n\r\nAnother plan, and a simpler and less expensive one, is to face only the\r\nends of the ponds with brick and cement work, carrying the brickwork\r\ninto the earth on each side, as shown in Fig. 1. In this case the sides\r\nof the ponds should be slightly sloped as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. It is\r\nadvisable if possible to make the outlet at the level of the bottom of\r\nthe pond, if the pond is lined with cement, but if the pond is only\r\ncemented at the ends, it is better to have one in mid-water or even near\r\nthe surface. As I have said before however, an outlet should be made at\r\nthe level lowest part of the bottom, so as to facilitate the emptying of\r\nthe pond. The pond should however be made shallower at the lower end.\r\nFig. 2 shows a section of the upper end, and Fig. 3 of the lower end of\r\nsuch a pond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe open trough between ponds in a series should be at least three yards\r\nin length, but it is better if not straight. Stones and gravel should be\r\nput in these troughs in order to make the water as rough as possible,\r\nand if some fresh-water shrimps can be introduced so much the better.\r\n\r\nIf the water is taken from a stream, a leaf screen must be placed at\r\nsome distance in front of the inlet. This may be made of a hurdle\r\nfastened to strong stakes sunk into the bed of the stream. The opening\r\nof the inlet should be at least double the size of the sectional area of\r\nthe pipe through which the water is carried to the ponds, and should be\r\nsome distance, a couple of feet if possible, below the surface of the\r\nwater. It is a good thing to put a wire cage over the inlet, and under\r\nthis a perforated zinc screen is necessary. The inlet from the stream\r\nshould be so placed that it is easy to get at and clean. The best form\r\nof covering for the inlet into the pond I have seen, is a zinc cylinder,\r\nthe base of which fits over the end of the inlet pipe. The part of this\r\ncylinder, which projects 18 inches beyond the pipe, is perforated, as is\r\nalso the flat end. This can easily be taken off and cleaned, and breaks\r\nup the water, making it fall into the pond like a shower bath, causing\r\nconsiderable aeration.\r\n\r\nThe inlet from the stream should have a trap with which the water may be\r\nshut off, as also should the outlet from the pond. When the cylinder on\r\nthe inlet into the pond is taken off for a minute or so to be cleaned\r\nout, both these traps must be closed. This lessens the chance of any\r\ncreatures likely to do harm getting in during the cleaning. The\r\nperforated zinc screen at the inlet from the stream will probably stop\r\nany such creatures, but too great care cannot be exercised, and it is\r\nalways best to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nMovable covers of netting over the ponds are most certainly advisable,\r\nparticularly if the rearing ponds are in an unfrequented spot near a\r\nstream. On one occasion I caught four kingfishers during a period of\r\nthree weeks, all of which had in some way got under some herring net,\r\nwhich was pegged out carefully over a rearing pond containing trout fry.\r\nI never found out how they got in, but once in they were unable to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nPonds such as I have described are of course for the fry when they have\r\nreached a certain size, and have already begun to feed well. Other\r\nappliances are necessary for hatching out the ova and for the young fish\r\nwhen first hatched. A very good apparatus may be made from a champagne\r\ncase. This should have large square holes sawn through each end, leaving\r\nenough wood to ensure strength and solidity to the box. The box should\r\nthen have two coats of asphalt varnish, and the square apertures covered\r\nwith fine perforated zinc. A still better box may be made at a small\r\ncost. This consists of a box with a wooden bottom and perforated zinc\r\nsides which are supported by a stout wooden frame.\r\n\r\nBeyond these boxes all that are required are some perforated zinc\r\nhatching trays. These should be 1-1/2 inches deep. They are very easily\r\nmade, and the ova hatch out well in them. Though ova sometimes hatch out\r\nvery successfully even when piled up in two or three layers, it is safer\r\nto have them in a single layer. The trays should be suspended in the\r\nboxes, and the boxes in the ponds close to the inlets, so that a good\r\ncurrent of water may flow through them. The bottom of the boxes should\r\nbe covered with a thick layer of gravel, but the trays are to be used\r\nwithout gravel. It is advisable to have as much grass as possible round\r\nthe ponds, and such trees as willows and alders should also be planted\r\nround them. Willows and alder sticks planted in the early part of the\r\nyear come into leaf in the same spring, and afford shade to the young\r\nfish in the summer. Some suitable weeds should also be grown in the\r\nrearing ponds. Water-cress, water-celery, water-lobelia, starwort, and\r\nwater-milfoil, are all good. They should be arranged, however, so as to\r\nprevent as much as possible the little fish finding hiding places, and\r\nit is for this reason also that I have recommended slightly sloping\r\nbanks when the sides of the ponds are not made of cement. The weeds\r\nshould be planted some time before the little fish are turned out of\r\nthe boxes.\r\n\r\nFinally, I must caution my readers again on one or two points before I\r\nleave the subject of the hatching trays, rearing boxes, and ponds.\r\nEnamel, varnish, or charr all woodwork thoroughly, leaving no speck of\r\nwood bare and no crack open. Let the water run through and over all your\r\nponds and apparatus for as long as possible before you begin\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTROUT. MANAGEMENT OF THE OVA AND ALEVINS\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything should now be ready for the reception of the ova. The rearing\r\nboxes are resting upon stones placed at the bottom of the ponds, with\r\nthe edges some six inches above the level of the water, and moored to\r\nthe sides to prevent their being moved by the current. The hatching\r\ntrays are suspended in the rearing boxes, or placed upon movable rests\r\nin the boxes, with their edges just above the level of the water.\r\n\r\nNotice is usually sent a day or two before the ova are despatched from\r\nfish cultural establishments, so the amateur has no excuse for not being\r\nabsolutely ready for their reception. They are packed in various ways,\r\nand nowadays suffer but little in the transit. The ova should always be\r\ncarefully washed before they are placed in the hatching trays. Mr.\r\nArmistead, in _A Handy Guide to Fish Culture_, says:--\"If just turned\r\nout of a packing case there may be small pieces of moss or other\r\nmaterial amongst them. In any case a wash will do them no harm, and the\r\nprocess is a very simple one. Take a pail, half-filled with ova, and\r\nthen fill up with water, and with a small lading-can lift some of the\r\nwater out, and pour it back again, so as to cause a downward current,\r\nwhich will agitate the ova. Their specific gravity being greater than\r\nthat of water, they immediately retire again to the bottom of the pail,\r\nand by at once pouring off as much water as is practicable, any floating\r\nparticles of moss, etc., may be carried off. Should any be left, the\r\nprocess should be repeated, and it may even be necessary to repeat it\r\nseveral times. When all is right take a ladle, or small vessel of some\r\nkind, say a good-sized tea-cup, and gently ladle out the eggs, and place\r\nthem roughly on the grills, where they may be roughly spread by means of\r\na feather.\"\r\n\r\nTo these instructions I would add some for the amateur, who will\r\nprobably deal with a comparatively small number of ova. The ova should\r\nbe washed in some large vessel full of water in the manner above\r\ndescribed. When the water is quite clear, and the ova clean, they may be\r\ncaught in mid-water as they are sinking either in the hatching trays or\r\nin a cup. If caught in a cup they should be transferred with great care\r\nto the hatching trays, and spread out in a single and somewhat spare\r\nlayer. They must on no account be poured into the trays from a height.\r\nWhile under water well-eyed ova will stand a good deal of gentle\r\ntumbling about, but if dropped into the water from even a little height\r\nthe concussion is likely to kill them.\r\n\r\nMr. Armistead recommends glass grills rather than trays such as I have\r\ndescribed, but I have found the trays work very well, and they are very\r\nsimple and clean. Glass grills are, however, very excellent, though they\r\nnecessitate a somewhat greater initial outlay than do the perforated\r\nzinc trays.\r\n\r\nA German fish culturist has recently recommended keeping a stock of\r\nfresh-water shrimps (_Gammarus pulex_) in the hatching trays and rearing\r\nboxes. He says that the shrimps eat only the dead ova, and never touch\r\nthe living ones. They also eat any vegetable or animal _débris_. I have\r\nnever tried the experiment myself, and so cannot speak from experience.\r\n\r\nDead ova should be always removed at once, and the hatching trays should\r\nbe gone over carefully once or twice a day to see if any are present in\r\nthem. Dead ova are easily recognized from the fact that they become\r\nopaque and white. They are best removed with a glass tube. The thumb is\r\nplaced over one end of the tube, and the other end brought directly over\r\nthe dead ovum. When the thumb is removed from the end of the tube held\r\nin the hand the water will rush up into the tube, carrying with it the\r\ndead ovum. The thumb is then replaced over the end of the tube, which is\r\nlifted from the water with the ovum retained in it. This tube may also\r\nbe used for removing any extraneous bodies which may get into the trays\r\nor boxes.\r\n\r\nA form of fungus known as _Byssus_ grows upon dead ova, and it is\r\nprincipally for this reason that they must be removed. Livingstone Stone\r\nsays of _Byssus_:--\"With trout eggs in water at 40° or 50° Fahrenheit,\r\nit generally appears within forty-eight hours after the egg turns white,\r\nand often sooner, and the warmer the water the quicker it comes. It is\r\nnever quite safe to leave the dead eggs over twenty-four hours in the\r\nhatching boxes. The peculiarity of _Byssus_ is that it stretches out its\r\nlong, slender arms, which grow rapidly over everything within its reach.\r\nThis makes it peculiarly mischievous, for it will sometimes clasp a\r\ndozen or even twenty eggs in its Briarean grasp before it is discovered,\r\nand any egg that it has seized has received its death warrant.\" Mr.\r\nArmistead has known it appear within twenty-four hours. _Byssus_\r\ndevelops only on dead ova.\r\n\r\n_Saprolegnia_, known to fish culturists as \"fungus,\" attacks both living\r\nor dead ova. If the woodwork is properly varnished or charred, and the\r\nova managed thoroughly, there should, however, be but little risk of\r\nfungus. Light is favourable to the growth of fungus, and, therefore,\r\nwooden lids should be placed over the rearing boxes. These should be\r\nkept partially on after the young fish have hatched out, and be replaced\r\nby covers of fine wire netting spread on closely-fitting frames, when\r\nthe fry have begun to feed. These obviate the necessity of covering up\r\nthe ponds during the first stages.\r\n\r\nMany small creatures such as caddis-worms will eat the ova, and\r\ntherefore a careful watch should be kept upon the hatching trays as it\r\nis marvellous how such creatures find their way in, in spite of all\r\nprecautions. Birds of several kinds are also likely to cause great\r\ndamage unless the ova and young fish are carefully guarded from their\r\ndepredations.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, probably within a few days of receiving the ova, the\r\namateur will find that the young fish are beginning to hatch out. They\r\ngenerally come out tail first, and in wriggling this about in their\r\nattempts to get further out, they propel the ovum about the bottom of\r\nthe tray. When the little fish attempts to come out head first, he\r\nsometimes gets into difficulties and if this is observed, he may be\r\nhelped by a gentle touch with a feather or a camel's hair brush.\r\n\r\nWhen first hatched out the young fish have a large translucent\r\nprotuberance on the under-surface. This is the umbilical or yolk-sac,\r\nand contains the nourishment upon which the little fish lives during the\r\nfirst stage of its life after it is hatched. This sac is gradually\r\nabsorbed but until it is absorbed the young fish are called \"alevins.\"\r\nAt first the little fish do not require any food, but they generally\r\nbegin to feed in about six weeks, and before the yolk-sac is completely\r\nabsorbed. The rearing boxes should be kept partly covered, and the\r\nalevins will crowd into a pack in the darker parts at the bottom of the\r\nhatching tray.\r\n\r\nThe shells of the ova must be removed from the hatching trays. As they\r\nare lighter than the alevins, the current will generally carry them to\r\nthe lower end of the tray, whence they may be removed with a piece of\r\ngauze spread on a wire ring, or by raising and lowering the tray gently\r\nin the water in alternately slanting directions.\r\n\r\nThe alevin stage is the stage in which the least mortality should be\r\nexpected, and the little fish give but little trouble. There are,\r\nhowever, several diseases besides fungus (of which I have spoken already\r\nwhen dealing with the ova) from which the alevins may suffer.\r\n\r\nI was, I believe, the first to describe (in the \"Rainbow Trout\") a\r\npeculiar disease from which alevins suffered. When hatched out and kept\r\nin water containing a very large quantity of air in solution, I found\r\nthat sometimes alevins developed an air bubble in the yolk-sac. On\r\ndeveloping this bubble they are unable to stay at the bottom as they\r\nusually do, but swim about on their backs at the surface, with part of\r\nthe yolk-sac out of the water. An effectual cure for this is to put the\r\naffected alevins into still water for about thirty-six hours. I have\r\nobserved this affection in the alevins of the rainbow trout (_Salmo\r\nirideus_), the common trout (_S. fario_) and the Quinnat or Californian\r\nSalmon (_Onchorynchus conicha_).\r\n\r\n\"Blue Swelling\" of the yolk-sac is another disease from which alevins\r\nsometimes suffer, but I have never heard of any cure for this. Another,\r\n\"paralysis,\" may be caused by lack of sufficient current and by\r\ninsufficient aeration of the water. Sickly alevins will, as a rule, drop\r\nout of the pack, and lie on the bottom or against the end of the\r\nhatching tray, where they are carried by the current.\r\n\r\nDead alevins should be removed at once, and for this reason it is\r\nnecessary that the hatching trays should be examined at least once a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTROUT. MANAGEMENT OF THE FRY\r\n\r\n\r\nA greatly varying period of time having elapsed and the yolk-sacs of the\r\nalevins being nearly absorbed, the fish culturist will see that some of\r\nthe little fish begin to leave the pack at the bottom of the tray, and\r\nto swim up against the current. When this is observed some very finely\r\ndivided food should be offered to these alevins. They will probably dart\r\nat the minute pieces of food floating past and a little more may then be\r\ngiven to them. If, however, they do not take any notice of little pieces\r\nof food or any other matter which floats past them, they should not be\r\ntried again till the next day. In a few days from the first of the\r\nalevins beginning to feed, all of them will be working up with their\r\nheads to the current, darting at any particles floating in the water.\r\nThe tray should now be lowered so that its edge is some three or four\r\ninches below the surface and the little fish allowed to swim out into\r\nthe box.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the yolk-sacs of the alevins are absorbed the little fish\r\ncease to be alevins, and are called \"fry.\"\r\n\r\nThe alevin stage was that in which the fish give least trouble, the\r\nstage I am now describing is that in which they give most. They must be\r\nfed frequently--at least four times a day. \"Little and often\" is the\r\nmaxim which should rule the actions of the fish culturist with regard to\r\nfeeding the fry. If he can only feed his fish four times a day, he must\r\nspend some time on each of these four occasions. The food must not be\r\nthrown in all at once. If this be done the little fish will not get half\r\nof it; the other half will sink to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe food should be introduced in small quantities at a time, and if the\r\namateur has several boxes he should put a little food into each in\r\nsuccession, coming back to the first when he has put some into the last,\r\nrepeating this operation at least half a dozen times. The less he puts\r\nin at each time, and the oftener he does it, the better. The ideal plan\r\nwould be to put a very small quantity of food in each time, and to go on\r\ndoing this at intervals of from five to ten minutes all day.\r\n\r\nLivingstone Stone says, \"You need not be afraid of the young fry's\r\neating too much.\" And again, \"I never knew any healthy young fry of mine\r\ndecline eating but once, and then I had fed them incessantly for two\r\nhours, at the end of which time they gave up, beaten.\" Personally, I\r\nhave found no limit to the time that the fry will continue feeding. I\r\nhave kept on putting small quantities of food into a rearing box for a\r\nwhole afternoon, and I was tired of feeding before the fry were tired of\r\neating. My reader will infer from this that I believe that the fry\r\ncannot be over-fed, and this is to a certain extent true. If finely\r\ndivided food is given in such small quantities that practically none of\r\nit sinks to the bottom without their having a fair chance at it, I\r\nbelieve that in a box containing only a couple of thousand fry, it would\r\nbe found that they never stopped feeding during the whole day. If,\r\nhowever, too large pieces of food are offered to the little fish, many\r\nof them are likely to be choked and to die, from trying to swallow a\r\npiece a little too big for them.\r\n\r\nThe amateur will observe that shortly after the fry have been let out\r\ninto the box and are feeding freely, they will separate into two more or\r\nless distinct groups. One at the upper end where the current comes in\r\nand is strongest, and one at the lower end. The fish at the upper end\r\nare the strongest and largest. This difference becomes more marked as\r\ntime goes on, and in six or eight weeks after they have begun to feed\r\nthe larger fish will be almost double the size of the smaller. In the\r\nmiddle of April, if many fry are in each box, they should be thinned\r\nout, and other boxes brought into use. The smaller fish may then be\r\ntaken from one or two boxes and put into another by themselves. In\r\nfeeding care should be taken that the small and weakly fish get a fair\r\nshare of the food.\r\n\r\nNo matter how carefully the feeding is managed, some of the food is sure\r\nto escape the young fish and sink to the bottom. This, if left as it is,\r\nwill decay and cause great mischief. A very simple and easily applied\r\nremedy for this evil exists in the use of mould dissolved in the water.\r\nLivingstone Stone recommends the mould under a sod, and I have always\r\nused this with the most beneficial effect. Earth, besides covering up\r\nand deodorizing the decomposing food at the bottom, also contains some\r\nmaterials which are apparently necessary to the well-being of trout. To\r\nquote again from Livingstone Stone, who was the discoverer of this use\r\nof mould: \"Earth or mud is the last thing one would suppose suitable for\r\na fish so associated in our minds with pure, clean water; yet it is an\r\nindispensable constituent in the diet of young trout, and unless they\r\nget it, either naturally or artificially, they will not thrive.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of earth given in this way upon the young fish is simply\r\nmarvellous. They become more lively and feed more freely. This is the\r\neffect of a spate--which is, after all, only a dose of earth--upon wild\r\ntrout.\r\n\r\nThe mould should be mixed with water in a bucket, and, when the water is\r\nvery thick and muddy, poured into the rearing boxes. The water in the\r\nrearing boxes should be so thick that neither the bottom nor the young\r\nfish, except when they come to the surface to take some passing particle\r\nof food, can be seen. The amateur should not wait till something goes\r\nwrong before giving this dose of earth; it is advisable to give it once\r\na week at any rate, and oftener if the fish seem to be ailing in any\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the subject of food for the young fish, I would begin by\r\nimpressing upon my reader that the greater variety of food he can give\r\nthe better it will be for the fish. He should also give them, at any\r\nrate after they have been feeding some weeks, a certain proportion of\r\nnatural food. Probably the best of all food for the fry is pounded\r\nshrimps or other crustaceans. It is, however, difficult in the very\r\nearly stages of the trout's life to pound shrimps up small enough, and\r\nthe little fish are much given to trying to swallow pieces of food which\r\nare too large for them to manage. This evil proclivity often causes the\r\ndeath of the fry, and therefore great care must be taken that no pieces\r\nof food which are too large, get into the rearing box. Pounded liver\r\nshaken up in a bottle with water, and after the larger particles have\r\nbeen allowed to settle at the bottom, poured into the rearing box in\r\nsmall quantities, is a good form of food for the alevins when they first\r\nbegin to feed. The yolks of eggs boiled for about half an hour and\r\npounded up, dog biscuit very finely pounded, or the fine food supplied\r\nby several of the fish cultural establishments are also excellent. In\r\ngiving moist food such as pounded shrimps, liver, meat, or the yolks of\r\neggs, a good plan while the fry are very small is to put the food in a\r\nsmall net made of fine muslin mounted on a wire ring, and dipping the\r\nend of this net into the water, allow small particles to escape through\r\nthe muslin. This ensures no large pieces getting into the rearing boxes.\r\nAs the fry grow larger, these precautions are of course modified, as the\r\nlittle fish are capable of swallowing larger pieces of food.\r\n\r\nWith regard to natural food, the amateur should take care to ensure a\r\ngood stock for the young fish. Many of the creatures suitable for food\r\nmay be cultivated in separate ponds at the same time as the fish, if a\r\nnatural supply is not at hand. The _Daphnia pulex_ (water flea) and the\r\n_Cyclops quadricornis_ may be introduced into the boxes very soon after\r\nthe fish have began to feed. _Daphnia_ breeds at the rate which is\r\nalmost inconceivable. The female produces her first brood of young when\r\nshe is ten days old, and goes on breeding at an average of three or four\r\ntimes a month. The female and her progeny are rendered fertile by one\r\nact of coition, probably for fifteen generations at least, without any\r\nfurther intervention of the male. Both _Daphnia_ and _Cyclops_ are bred\r\nin stagnant water in which there should be a good stock of weeds.\r\n\r\nThe fresh water shrimp (_Gammarus pulex_) is an excellent form of food\r\nfor young and old trout, and should be given to the fry as soon as they\r\nare old enough to manage them. _Corixæ_ and other small insects should\r\nalso be given as often as possible. The fresh-water shrimp is bred in\r\nrunning water, _Corixæ_ in still or slow running water. Weeds are\r\nnecessary to the well-being of both.\r\n\r\nThe boxes must be kept carefully covered, as I have already pointed out.\r\nA kingfisher would make short work of a box of fry, and other birds and\r\nbeasts of various kinds are partial to them. There are only two courses\r\nopen to the fish culturist in dealing with these enemies--to protect his\r\nfish or kill the enemies. I prefer to protect the fish first and kill\r\nthe enemies afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care must be taken not to introduce, or allow to intrude,\r\nany water beetles or the larger carnivorous aquatic larvæ of insects,\r\ninto the rearing boxes. I have known cases where the larvæ of the\r\n_Dytiscus marginalis_, the largest of our carnivorous water beetles,\r\nhave destroyed almost all the fry in a rearing pond. The adult _D.\r\nmarginalis_ itself is not a whit less voracious, and much stronger than\r\nits larva.\r\n\r\nIf the wooden parts of the apparatus have been properly prepared,\r\naccording to my previous instructions, there should be no risk of the\r\nfry developing fungus. Quite a small spot of woodwork, however, left\r\nuncovered by asphalt-varnish, or enamel, or uncharred, will render the\r\nchance of the development of this disease probable.\r\n\r\nShould by any misfortune fungus get into the rearing boxes, a dose of\r\nsalt may very likely cure it. Sea water is the best, but if this is not\r\nobtainable, a solution of salt and water run through the boxes will\r\nprobably cure the disease. Considerable good may also be done to the\r\nyoung fish by occasionally putting a lump of rock salt in at the inlet,\r\nand the water allowed to run over and dissolve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTROUT. THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FRY (_Continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I brought my reader up to the point where the fry,\r\nwhich had been feeding for some time in the rearing boxes, had been\r\njudiciously separated, the weaker and smaller fish which took up their\r\npositions at the lower ends of the boxes having been put into separate\r\nboxes and induced as much as possible to keep at the head near to where\r\nthe current enters.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to lay down any certain rule as to what is the best time\r\nat which to take the next step--that of turning the fry out into the\r\nrearing ponds. When the fry have got into more or less regular habits,\r\nand showing no fear of whoever it is who feeds them, come up readily and\r\nseize the food boldly, is probably the best time to let them out into\r\nthe larger space of the pond. I do not mean to say that when a certain\r\nproportion of the fish have got over their natural shyness, and feed\r\nboldly and without hesitation, the whole of them should be set free.\r\nWhat I mean is, that when the habit of associating the appearance of a\r\ncertain individual with a meal has been well established among them for\r\na week or so, they should be allowed to escape from the box into the\r\npond.\r\n\r\nThis is best done in the same way that the alevins were allowed to\r\nescape from the hatching tray into the box--by lowering the level of the\r\nbox so that its upper edges are some two or three inches below the\r\nsurface of the water. The food should now be thrown into the pond higher\r\nup, so that the little fish may be induced to swim up and station\r\nthemselves as near the inlet as possible. Probably some of the little\r\nfish will not leave the box at all of their own free will. These, of\r\ncourse, will have to be turned out. The box should not, however, be\r\nlifted out of the water and the fish and water together be poured out,\r\nas this is very likely to cause them severe injury. The box should be\r\ngradually tilted over and lifted out of the water bottom first, so that\r\nthe fish are hardly disturbed at all and certainly not injured in any\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAn important matter to consider before turning the little fish out into\r\nthe pond is, how the ponds are to be protected so that their many\r\nenemies may be kept away from the fry. Kingfishers, herons, and other\r\ncreatures are very partial to young trout and will cause enormous\r\ndestruction if not prevented. Kingfishers have, in my experience, been\r\nthe worst offenders. Some years ago I was rearing some trout in a part\r\nof the country where many of the inhabitants bewailed the extermination\r\nof the kingfisher. Before I began rearing trout I agreed with these\r\npeople, for a kingfisher flitting along a stream looking like a little\r\nmass of jewels is a pleasing sight, and one which I had never enjoyed in\r\nthat particular part of the country.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came to set my little fish free in the rearing ponds, as a\r\nmatter of principle I covered the ponds with herring-net, closely pegged\r\ndown on the banks so that I could not even get my hand under the edge. I\r\ndid not think that there were any kingfishers or herons about, and so\r\nwas very surprised when one morning, on going down to feed the fish, I\r\nfound a kingfisher under the net, flying up and down the pond trying to\r\nget out. By carefully introducing a landing-net under the netting over\r\nthe pond, I was able to catch the intruder, and caught four more in the\r\nsame way in about three weeks. Since that time I have not agreed with\r\nthe people who have stated that the kingfisher is almost extinct, at\r\nleast in that part of the country. I may say that there are but few\r\nstreams there, and that it is not at all an apparently likely place for\r\nkingfishers. I am quite sure that wherever any one begins to rear fish\r\nthere he will find that kingfishers are fairly common. The amateur will\r\nprobably be also surprised at the way herons appear, if he conducts his\r\nfish-rearing operations, as he should do, in a secluded spot.\r\n\r\nMany of the directions I gave as to the management of the fry and the\r\nrearing boxes, apply also to the fry after they have been turned out\r\ninto the ponds. The doses of earth should still be given regularly, and\r\nsalt may be applied also in the way I have already described. The little\r\nfish will be found to scatter over the pond or to divide again into two\r\nbodies, one at the upper and one at the lower end of the pond, as they\r\ndid in the boxes. The fish culturist should try to induce these fish to\r\ncome to the head of the pond as much as possible. It is a good thing to\r\nplace some boards across the head of the pond to give shade and shelter\r\nto the fry. It will probably be found that if much artificial food is\r\ngiven to the little fish, a scum will be formed on the surface of the\r\nwater. This scum is composed of grease, and should be removed, as soon\r\nas it is observed, with a gauze net.\r\n\r\nAll the time that these operations have been going on with regard to the\r\nlittle fish themselves, due attention should have been given to the\r\nvegetation round the ponds. The alders and willows which I before\r\nrecommended to be planted round the ponds should be induced as much as\r\npossible to overhang the water. Grass and other vegetation should be\r\nallowed to grow freely round the margins, as many insects are then\r\nlikely to fall into the water.\r\n\r\nThis vegetation will supply the little fish with a certain amount of\r\nnatural floating food, without any interference on the part of the fish\r\nculturist; but he should, however, give them other floating food, both\r\nnatural and artificial, as much as possible, for this will get them in\r\ntheir youth to adopt the habit of feeding freely at the surface. When\r\nthe alders and willows have grown sufficiently and are well covered with\r\nleaves, they will probably give enough shelter to the fish to make the\r\nboards at the upper end of the pond unnecessary.\r\n\r\nAs time goes on, and the little fish grow, they should be thinned out,\r\nthe smaller and weaker being removed into another pond. Despite the best\r\nendeavours of the fish culturist, a certain number of these small fish\r\nare sure to keep to the lower end of the pond, and it is these which\r\nshould be removed first. If they are left, the difference in size\r\nbetween the smaller and the larger will soon become so great that the\r\nlarge fish will very likely be tempted to eat the small ones, thus\r\ndeveloping a cannibalistic habit which they will keep always.\r\n\r\nAt the end of August or the beginning of September the little fish will\r\nhave got over the most dangerous part of their lives. After this time\r\nthey are called yearlings, are much more hardy and not subject to nearly\r\nas many risks as up to that time.\r\n\r\nThe great points to remember are:--That the food should be varied as\r\nmuch as possible; and as much natural food, of a hard description such\r\nas shrimps, _corixæ_, snails, bivalves, etc., be given. That the little\r\nfish should be well protected from enemies. That they should not be\r\nover-crowded, but the weakly and small fish be separated from the larger\r\nfish. That frequent doses of earth should be given to keep the bottom\r\nsweet and clean.[2] That the inlets and outlets should be frequently\r\ncleaned and kept clear, to ensure a good flow of water through the\r\nponds, and that a careful watch should be kept for such misfortunes as\r\nfungus and dead fish, in order that they may be dealt with at once.\r\n\r\n[2] See two letters in Appendix.--Page 93\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTROUT. THE FRIENDS AND ENEMIES OF THE FISH CULTURIST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe creatures which are sometimes found in and around rearing ponds\r\ncontaining ova or young fish are very numerous, and it is advisable that\r\nthe fish culturist should have some knowledge of them. It is for this\r\nreason, that while I cautioned my readers against the creatures which\r\nare dangerous, and enumerated some of those most serviceable as food, I\r\nleft detailed descriptions of these enemies and friends of the little\r\nfish, in order that I might deal with them in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARVA OF _DYTISCUS_ AND YOUNG TROUT.]\r\n\r\nAmong the worst enemies of both ova and fry is the _Dytiscus\r\nmarginalis_, whether this insect be in the larval or adult stage. I\r\nthink that I should hardly be wrong in going even further and saying\r\nthat _D. marginalis_ is very dangerous to trout early in their yearling\r\nstage. The accompanying illustration shows a larva of _Dytiscus_\r\nwhich has caught a young trout. This illustration is taken from a\r\nphotograph of a specimen lent to me by Mr. F. M. Halford, and both the\r\nfish and the larva were alive when they were caught. Unfortunately the\r\ntrout is a little shrivelled, and the legs of the _Dytiscus_ have been\r\nbroken. _D. marginalis_ lays its eggs in the stems of rushes. The larva,\r\nwhen hatched, makes its way out, and proceeds to lead a predatory life.\r\nThe larva when full-grown is about two inches long, and is quite the\r\nmost rapacious creature which lives in our waters. The adult beetle is\r\nalso purely carnivorous, but is perhaps not quite so rapacious. It\r\nwould, however, probably attack a larger fish.\r\n\r\nThe largest of English water beetles is _Hydrophilus piceus_. This\r\nbeetle is not, in the adult stage at least, carnivorous, but the larva,\r\nwhich is about half an inch longer and considerably fatter than that of\r\n_D. marginalis_, is carnivorous. It may be told from the larva of\r\n_Dytiscus_ not only by its size, which is hardly a reliable point for\r\ndiscrimination, but by the smaller size of the head in comparison to the\r\nrest of the body. The claws, with which _Hydrophilus_ seizes its prey,\r\nare, too, considerably smaller than those of _Dytiscus_. This larva\r\nshould be kept out of the rearing ponds with just as much care as that\r\nof the more voracious _D. marginalis_.\r\n\r\nWith the kingfisher I have already dealt at some length, so that I need\r\nsay but little more with regard to it. One of the worst features in this\r\nbird's character is that it will go on killing many more little fish\r\nthan it can possibly eat. As I have before said, it is surprising how\r\nthese birds will appear in considerable numbers where a fish hatchery is\r\nstarted, even in localities where they have before been considered rare.\r\nI have already described how the ponds should be protected from their\r\nravages.\r\n\r\nHerons do a great deal of harm to fish ponds, even when the fish have\r\ngot well into the yearling stage. I have on one or two occasions known\r\nof herons wounding trout of at least a pound in weight. Besides the\r\nactual damage they do by killing fish, they put all the other fish in\r\nthe pond off their feed through frightening them. After a heron or\r\nkingfisher has been about a rearing pond the little fish will not feed\r\nfor a considerable time, sometimes even for days. Notwithstanding their\r\nvery evil proclivities, both herons and kingfishers are very\r\ninteresting. A kingfisher, if he catches a fish which is a little too\r\nbig for him to swallow whole, will knock the head of the fish, which he\r\nalways catches by the middle of the body, against a stone, in order to\r\nkill it, or at least to stop it struggling; it might otherwise in its\r\nstruggles escape, as the kingfisher can only swallow a fish head first.\r\nThere are stories which tell how herons sometimes pluck small feathers\r\nfrom their breasts and, floating these feathers upon the water, catch\r\nthe trout as they rise to it; it is supposed that the trout takes the\r\nfeather for a fly. Personally, I do not think that much credence should\r\nbe attached to the latter story.\r\n\r\nOther birds, usually found on or near the water, are also likely to do\r\nmuch harm to the ova and young fish. Almost every creature which is\r\nfound near the water seems to have a great liking for the ova of fishes.\r\nAll the wading and swimming birds are to be dreaded by the fish\r\nculturist. They will, all of them, eat ova in enormous quantities, and\r\nmany of them will also eat the little fish.\r\n\r\nBesides birds, small larvæ of several insects will eat, or at any rate\r\nkill, the ova in considerable numbers. Caddis-worms are among these\r\nlarvæ which eat ova. This seems to be one of the few cases in which\r\nnature is just, for caddis-worms are taken very readily by even small\r\ntrout. Large trout will take them very greedily, cases and all.\r\nTherefore, I should advise the fish culturist to cultivate them as food\r\nfor the fish he is rearing, but to be very careful that they do not get\r\ninto the rearing boxes or hatching trays when he has ova in them. The\r\ncaddis-worms kill the ova by making a small hole in them and sucking\r\nsome of the contents out; from this hole some more of the contents\r\nescapes, and as it comes into contact with the water becomes opaque.\r\n\r\nCaddis-worms are the larvæ of an order of four-winged flies commonly\r\nknown as sedges, caddis-flies, or water-moths. The latter appellation is\r\nof course a misnomer, as these flies (_Trichoptera_) have nothing\r\nwhatever to do with moths. They resemble moths, however, in that they\r\nhave four wings which when at rest lie in much the same position as do\r\nthose of moths, and as many of them have their wings thickly covered\r\nwith hairs, this resemblance is sometimes very marked. The larvæ\r\n(caddis-worms), being eagerly sought as food by many fish, and having\r\nvery soft bodies, make for themselves cases. Some of these cases are\r\nmade from small sticks, some from little pieces of stone or sand, and\r\nsome from a mixture of all of these substances. As these cases resemble\r\nsuch small pieces of rubbish as are frequently found in streams, care\r\nshould be taken that they do not get into the hatching trays containing\r\nova.\r\n\r\nMany of the water beetles, and practically all of their larvæ, will\r\nattack the ova; they should therefore be carefully excluded from the\r\nhatching trays. As there are about 114 different species of beetles in\r\nthe family of _Dytiscidæ_ alone, my readers will appreciate my reason\r\nfor not attempting to enumerate them. It will be a sufficient warning to\r\nstate the fact that they are all carnivorous, and their relative sizes\r\nis the only thing which will decide whether the beetle will eat the\r\nfish, or the fish the beetle.\r\n\r\nVery similar to beetles are some of the water-bugs. They may, however,\r\neasily be distinguished from beetles, as the outer or anterior wings of\r\nthe bugs cross each other at their lower ends, while the elytra of\r\nbeetles, which much resemble the horny, anterior wings of some of the\r\nwater-bugs, meet exactly in the middle line. These water-bugs, though\r\nsome of them are excellent food for even the small fish, will attack the\r\nova, and therefore they should be kept out of the hatching trays. The\r\nfish culturist should, however, whenever it is possible, cultivate such\r\nof these water-bugs as are good food for the fry in separate ponds, as I\r\nhave before recommended. The best of these water-bugs are _Corixæ_.\r\nOthers, such as the water-boatman, water-scorpions and pond-skaters, are\r\nnot of any value as food for the fish.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of _Ephemeridæ_ are very good food for the fish, and should be\r\ncultivated in separate ponds if possible, and some turned into the ponds\r\ncontaining the little fish occasionally. A fair proportion should,\r\nhowever, be kept in the ponds and protected, so that a good stock of the\r\nflies may be available next year.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of _Ephemeridæ_ may be obtained in many streams, and are best\r\ncaught with a fine gauze net. Some of them swim, but most are generally\r\ncaptured with such a net at the bottom of the water among the _débris_.\r\nEggs of _Ephemeridæ_ may be obtained sometimes from another locality if\r\nthey cannot be got on the spot. These should be carefully preserved for\r\nthe first year at any rate, and a good fly may thus be introduced into a\r\nwater where it was before unknown.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the fresh-water shrimp and the water-flea\r\n(_Daphnia pulex_). These valuable articles of diet should be introduced\r\nwhenever it is possible. _Daphnia_ must be reared in a stagnant pond,\r\nthe fresh-water shrimp (_Gammarus pulex_) in running water, with plenty\r\nof weeds.\r\n\r\nOther useful creatures besides those snails and mussels which I\r\ndescribed in a previous chapter, are the water-louse (_Asellus\r\naquaticus_), _Cypridæ_, and _Cyclops quadricornis_. Asellus is very\r\nsimilar in size and shape to the common garden-louse, which is found in\r\ndecaying wood. It will live either in stagnant or running water.\r\n_Cypridæ_ are very much smaller, being generally only as large as a\r\nlarge pin's head. They have a bivalve shell which makes them look\r\nsomething like a small mussel. They are, however, very active, swimming\r\nby means of two pairs of legs. They also possess two pairs of antennæ\r\nand one eye. (The species belonging to the genus _Candona_ of the family\r\n_Cypridæ_, do not swim.) _Cyclops_ is another very small crustacean,\r\nshaped like a large-headed club. It swims very actively, and, like the\r\n_Cypridæ_, is an excellent article of diet for very young fish. Both\r\nthese crustacea live in stagnant water, and must, therefore, be kept in\r\na separate pond, whence they may be taken as required to be given to the\r\nfry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTROUT. MANAGEMENT, FEEDING, AND TURNING OUT OF YEARLINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I pointed out to my readers in Chapter VIII., the young trout have\r\nafter August passed the critical period of their existence, and may be\r\nconsidered safe and hardy. Naturally, as they get older, they require\r\nmore food, but this need not be given so frequently as the fish grow\r\nolder. While it was necessary to feed the fry at least four times a day,\r\nit will be found quite sufficient if the fish in August are fed only\r\ntwice during the twenty-four hours. I must here again impress upon my\r\nreader the importance of feeding the trout upon as natural a food as\r\npossible. Their future well-being depends upon this, much more than is\r\ngenerally realized even by fish culturists. Of course, trout fed\r\nentirely upon soft food may turn out all right, particularly if they are\r\nturned out as very young yearlings, but it is better not to leave\r\nanything to chance and make sure of being on the safe side.\r\n\r\nAs was the case with the fry during the whole of the earlier part of\r\ntheir lives, the yearlings will divide into two more or less separate\r\npacks, though the fish may have been separated several times before in\r\norder to divide those which kept at the head from those which kept at\r\nthe lower end of the pond. Those trout at the lower end must be coaxed\r\nto the upper end as much as possible, care being taken when feeding that\r\nall the fish get a fair share of food. Should any of the fish remain\r\nobstinately at the lower end, and those at the upper end outgrow them to\r\na marked extent, the smaller ones must be again separated from the\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\nWhen, in September or October, the little fish have grown active and\r\nstrong, they may be turned out into the water they are to occupy for the\r\nrest of their lives. There is really no reason why, if they are\r\nwell-grown and strong, they should not be turned out in August if the\r\nwater they have to be taken to is quite close to the rearing ponds, but\r\nif they have to be carried any distance, it is better to keep them in\r\nthe rearing ponds for a few weeks longer, till the weather gets cool\r\nenough to make it quite safe to allow for a possible delay in the\r\ntransit.\r\n\r\nThe turning out of the fish requires some little care. I have seen fish\r\nwhich had been sent by rail, poured out with the water contained in the\r\ncans, in as hurried a manner as possible. Though of course it is\r\nimportant to get the fish out of the cans used for transport as soon as\r\nis compatible with safety; still, undue haste in this operation is\r\nlikely to do much harm. Young fish of any kind require delicate\r\nhandling, and young trout particularly. The cans should, when possible,\r\nbe partly emptied, and some water from that into which they are to be\r\nturned put into the can. This is of course not necessary if the rearing\r\nponds are supplied from the same source as the water into which the fish\r\nare turned. The cans should then be partially immersed in the water, and\r\nthe edges brought gradually below the surface. This allows the fish to\r\nswim out of the cans of their own accord, and the few which will not go\r\nout may be forced to do so by gently turning the can upside down.\r\n\r\nIt is a very good thing to give each of the fish a dose of salt before\r\nturning them out, particularly if they have travelled any distance. This\r\nis easily managed by catching the fish, a few at a time, in a\r\nlanding-net from the travelling can, and then, instead of putting them\r\nstraight into the water, putting them into a bucket of salt and water\r\nfor a short time. Sea water is of course better if it is available. This\r\ndoes away with any risk of their developing fungus on the spots which\r\nhave very likely got bruised during the journey.\r\n\r\nThe yearlings are best taken from the rearing ponds by netting them. A\r\nnet which is more than broad enough to go across the rearing pond is\r\nnecessary. Too many should not be taken out at a time in each haul of\r\nthe net, as they are thus more likely to be injured or dropped on the\r\nground. The amateur should not forget, that though the little fish will\r\nstand a good deal of moving about as long as they are in water, they are\r\nlikely to be killed, or at least severely injured, by a shock,\r\nparticularly if that shock is sustained while they are out of the water\r\nfor a second or two during their being moved from one place to another.\r\n\r\nIf the amateur intends to keep any of his yearlings longer than\r\nDecember, he will have to make a larger pond. This pond need not be a\r\nlong, narrow one like those in which the fry were kept. Though the fish\r\nof course still require a sufficient supply of well-aerated water, a\r\nlarger pond without the same marked current through it will do perfectly\r\nwell. They must be well fed, and if any grow markedly bigger than the\r\nrest these should be separated. If they are not well supplied with food\r\nthey are very likely to try and eat each other, that is to say, the\r\nlargest will try to eat the smallest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE REARING OF THE RAINBOW TROUT, AMERICAN BROOK TROUT, AND CHAR\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the methods used in hatching out the ova and rearing the young fish\r\nare very similar in the case of different species of trout to those I\r\nhave already described in dealing with the common trout (_Salmo fario_),\r\nI will confine myself to pointing out the most marked differences in the\r\nhabits of such species as are suitable to our waters, and which are\r\nlikely to be of use to the fish culturist. The salmon- or sea-trout will\r\nbe dealt with under salmon.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost among the trout, excluding of course our own brown\r\ntrout, I put the rainbow trout (_Salmo irideus_). There are several\r\nvarieties of this species, but that which is now being so freely\r\nintroduced into many waters in England is the McCloud River rainbow (_S.\r\nirideus_, var. _shasta_). As I have before stated, the rainbow spawns\r\nlong after the _S. fario_. It therefore will give the fly-fishermen good\r\nsport after the season for the common trout is over. It is a very free\r\nfeeder, and grows more rapidly than our trout; great care must therefore\r\nbe taken to give it plenty of food. I would draw my readers' attention\r\nparticularly to this fact as to the feeding and quick-growing qualities\r\nof the rainbow, for they make it, if possible, even more necessary that\r\nthe water into which they are turned should contain a good supply of\r\nfood than it was in the case of the common trout; though even in the\r\ncase of the common trout, this is quite the most important consideration\r\nin stocking a water with fish.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage possessed by the rainbow is, that it is less liable to\r\nthe attacks of fungus than any other of the _Salmonidæ_. Though, of\r\ncourse, this is not such an important consideration nowadays as it would\r\nhave been even a few years ago, still it is one which deserves some\r\nconsideration, particularly from the amateur. This freedom from fungus\r\nis very marked in the rainbow, for I know of a case where some dace\r\nsuffering from fungus were put into a rearing pond containing a few\r\nrainbows. Though the dace died of the disease, the rainbows remained\r\nhealthy and free from it. The amateur will probably receive the ova of\r\nthe rainbow towards the end of April or during May. The ova should hatch\r\nout within a few days of their being received.\r\n\r\nA few years, I might almost say months ago, the great majority of\r\ndisinterested persons, whose opinion was of any consequence, were\r\ninclined to condemn the general introduction of this fish into our\r\nwaters. I was, unfortunately, supposed to be among a certain class of\r\npeople who advocated the general introduction of this fish into all our\r\nwaters indiscriminately. This, I have always said, was a very\r\nshort-sighted policy, for, to begin with, the evidence at our disposal\r\nseems to show that the rainbow will never thrive in cold waters, and at\r\nthe best can only be expected to really thrive and spawn in the warm\r\nwaters in the south of England. I never advocated more for the rainbow\r\nthan that it should have a fair trial in waters where our own trout had\r\nbeen tried and found not to be a success. Now, however, I in my turn\r\nstand a chance of being converted by converts from among the very people\r\nwho, a short time ago, were condemning me for holding too favourable an\r\nopinion of the fish in question. I am inclined to think that in the\r\ncase of a pond in the south, even when it is supplied by a good stream,\r\nthe rainbow is the better fish with which to stock. I have been led to\r\nbelieve this, partly through my own experience, and partly on account of\r\nthe opinion of Mr. Senior, for I consider his opinion on such a matter\r\nof the greatest possible value.\r\n\r\nAnother point about the rainbow, which in many cases will recommend it\r\nparticularly to the amateur, is that though of course an abundant supply\r\nof water is an advantage, it may be reared with a smaller supply.\r\n\r\nA fish which has been very freely introduced into British waters is the\r\nAmerican brook-trout (_Salvelinus fontinalis_). Though this fish is not\r\nreally a trout but a char I have included it among trout, because it is\r\nso very generally known to fishermen as the American brook-trout. The\r\n_fontinalis_, as it is commonly called by fish culturists, is a very\r\nsatisfactory fish to rear artificially, but there seems to be some doubt\r\nas to its suitability to British waters. It grows to a considerable size\r\nunder favourable conditions, and is one of the best of table fishes. It\r\nis, however, undoubtedly one of the worst of cannibals among sporting\r\nfishes, and does not apparently rise freely to the fly when about two\r\nyears old and older.\r\n\r\nThe spawning season is extended over an even longer period than that of\r\nour own brown trout, beginning, in its native country, in October, and\r\nsometimes lasting till March. It shows a very marked tendency, at any\r\nrate in America, to go down to the sea, and in some parts of Canada is\r\ncalled a sea-trout. The fish are easy to rear, but I should recommend\r\ngreat caution with regard to their introduction into any waters in\r\nEngland. The remarks and instructions which I gave with regard to the\r\ncommon trout, apply also to the _fontinalis_, but I would lay particular\r\nstress upon the necessity of separating the fish, as soon as some grow\r\nlarger than the rest. The only drawback to this fish, from the fish\r\nculturist's point of view, is that though a very free feeder, it is very\r\ndainty, sometimes refusing a particular kind of food for no apparent\r\nreason. As the spawning season is extended over such a considerable\r\nperiod of time, it is obvious that the amateur will be able to obtain\r\nthe ova, ready to hatch out, during a similarly lengthy period.\r\n\r\nA fish which I should very much like to see tried in England, is the\r\ncut-throat trout (_Salmo mykiss_). It is also known as the red-throat\r\ntrout. I should think, from the description given in the report of the\r\nCommission of Fisheries, Game, and Forests for the State of New York,\r\nthat it would do well in many of our waters. There are many varieties of\r\nthis species of trout. The common name of them all is _Salmo mykiss_,\r\nthe black-spotted trout of the Rocky Mountains. The cut-throat trout\r\nproper, so called from the red colour of its throat, is simply S.\r\nmykiss, but there are many varieties described. Among these are the\r\nColumbia River trout (_S. mykiss_, var. _clarkii_), the Lake Tahoe trout\r\n(_S. mykiss_, var. _henshawi_), the Rio Grande trout (_S. mykiss_, var.\r\n_spilurus_), and the Colorado River trout (_S. mykiss_, var.\r\n_pleuriticus_). As these names show, the black-spotted trout has a very\r\nwide range and is found in what are totally different climates. I should\r\nvery much like to see the cut-throat and the Columbia River varieties\r\ntried in our waters, particularly the former, as they would probably\r\nsucceed in waters which are too cold for the rainbow, and might very\r\nlikely thrive where our own trout (_S. fario_) is not a success. As it\r\nis found in climates which vary so much as do Alaska and California, it\r\nwould probably be easy to find one variety, if not two or three, which\r\nwould thrive in England. It is a particularly fine trout, and the\r\nordinary maximum weight is five or six pounds, though some of the\r\nvarieties grow much larger.\r\n\r\nChar, proper, are not at all satisfactory fish to rear. They are very\r\ndelicate, and require much more care and attention than do any of the\r\nfish I have already described. From the very first period of their\r\ncoming under the care of the amateur fish culturist, that is to say,\r\nfrom the ova, just before hatching out, till they are yearlings, the\r\nmortality among them will be much greater than in the case of any of the\r\ntrout.\r\n\r\nThe two kinds of char, most commonly to be obtained by the amateur, are\r\nthe Alpine and the Windermere char. The ova of these fish will be\r\nreceived shortly before they are ready to hatch out, as was the case\r\nwith the trout ova. The amateur's difficulties will, however, begin\r\nalmost at once, for in the act of hatching out considerable mortality\r\namong the char often occurs. Trout almost invariably emerge from the egg\r\ntail first. As soon as the tail is free the little fish begins to move\r\nit rapidly, using it as a propeller with which to swim about and thus\r\nsoon works completely out of the egg. Occasionally, however, trout\r\nhatch out head first, and in these cases the young fish generally dies\r\nbefore it can set itself free from the coverings of the ovum. Buckland\r\nobserved that the alevins of the char very frequently hatch out head\r\nfirst, and consequently that many of them die before they can work\r\nthemselves free from the eggs. If it were possible to have some one\r\nconstantly watching the ova at the time that they are hatching out, it\r\nwould be possible to save a very large proportion of them, as they may\r\nbe very effectually helped out of the egg with a feather or soft\r\ncamel's-hair brush; but this is, of course, quite impracticable, unless\r\nthere is some one constantly watching the ova, as the delay of even a\r\nfew minutes will mean the death of the fish. This peculiarity in the\r\nhatching out of the char has also been observed by Mr. J. J. Armistead,\r\nand I have been able to verify it personally.\r\n\r\nThe mortality which occurs in the actual hatching out of the alevins\r\ndoes not, however, by any means end the trouble which the fish culturist\r\nhas to encounter in the rearing of char. They require much more\r\npersuasion and care when they begin to feed and throughout the whole of\r\nthe summer. The percentage of deaths is always greater than in the case\r\nof the trouts, not excluding the _fontinalis_, which is, as I have\r\nalready explained, not really a trout but a char.\r\n\r\nThough there must be some doubt as to its success, I should like to see\r\na really serious attempt at introducing char into some deep and large\r\nponds in the south of England. Char have been very successfully reared\r\nin shallow water, which was certainly not kept at a particularly low\r\ntemperature, so I see no reason why this fish should not do in some of\r\nour more southern waters. One drawback to the chance of this attempt\r\nbeing made, however, is that the char cannot be considered as being a\r\nfish which gives very good sport, and I very much doubt whether any one\r\nis likely to try the experiment simply to find out whether they would or\r\nwould not succeed in the south of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSALMON AND SEA-TROUT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many ways nature is apparently very wasteful, and in nothing is this\r\nmore marked than in the case of the salmon. Probably not more than one\r\negg in a thousand produces a fish which reaches the smolt stage, and a\r\nstill smaller proportion grows to the spawning stage. This great\r\nmortality which occurs among the eggs and young fish when left to nature\r\nmay be very considerably reduced by artificial means, so that a very\r\nfair proportion of the eggs deposited by the female fish will not only\r\nbe hatched out successfully, but the little fish will reach the smolt\r\nstage safely and have a good chance of reaching the sea. How successful\r\nartificial intervention may be has been proved over and over again in\r\nthe United States and in Canada. In the case of more than one river in\r\nCanada, the artificial propagation and protection of salmon has resulted\r\nin what is apparently the actual manufacture of a salmon river,\r\nyielding an annual haul of fish far beyond anything known in Europe,\r\nfrom a river which before yielded no salmon, or hardly any.\r\n\r\nThese operations, carried out by the State, were of course far beyond\r\nanything which could be undertaken by the amateur, but I am sure that if\r\nseveral riparian owners on a salmon river carried on artificial hatching\r\nand rearing operations for several seasons, a marked increase in the\r\nnumber of fish in the river would ensue. The objection of most people to\r\nthis course is that it is unfortunately only too apparent that they are\r\nbenefiting chiefly, not the rod fisherman, but the netsman at the mouth\r\nof the river.\r\n\r\nThe different artificial means used to help nature in producing a good\r\nhead of salmon in a river vary chiefly in the amount of the help given\r\nby each. It will suffice to say that the best is that which provides for\r\nthe protection and feeding of the young fish till it is ready to take\r\nits first journey to the sea. The reason of this is obvious, as every\r\nday passed in safety is a day gained, both in strength and in power of\r\nself-preservation.\r\n\r\nThough it is possible to purchase a certain number of salmon ova, this\r\nis not at all a satisfactory way of obtaining them. To begin with, it is\r\nimpossible to get them in sufficient numbers to carry out operations on\r\na large enough scale. Salmon ova are also expensive; and it is no use\r\nworking with less than half a million in several stations if the river\r\nis of any size. It is advisable that the ova should be obtained from the\r\nfish. This may be done either by collecting the ova deposited by the\r\nfish in the spawning beds or from the gravid females. The latter course\r\nnecessitates the ripe female and male fish being caught and artificially\r\nspawned. As in nature, at best but a comparatively small percentage of\r\nthe ova are impregnated, and by artificial spawning over ninety per\r\ncent. of them may be successfully hatched out, there can be but little\r\ndoubt as to which is the better way. It is difficult to make sure of\r\ncatching the fish just at the time they are ripe, so it is advisable to\r\nimpound them in a fenced-off portion of the river, where they may be got\r\nat easily.\r\n\r\nIn the ripe female the ova flow out very readily, and but little\r\npressure is necessary. Hard pressure on the abdomen should never be\r\napplied, as it is sure to injure the fish. A ripe female having been\r\nobtained, from which the ova flow readily, the female is held over a\r\nperfectly clean tin or earthenware dish--wet, but containing no\r\nwater--and the ova are caused to flow into it by gently but firmly\r\npressing the hand on the abdomen, and stroking it down towards the vent.\r\nMilt from a ripe male fish is then allowed to run over the ova in the\r\ndish, and is made to run well between them by tilting the dish about\r\nfrom side to side. The ova will now adhere together, and some water\r\nshould be added. This water should be poured off and fresh added till\r\nthe superfluous milt is washed away, when the ova should be left in the\r\nwater till they separate, which will be in about twenty minutes or half\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nThe fertilized ova thus obtained may either be laid down in artificially\r\nprotected hatching beds, or may be transferred to a hatchery. The latter\r\nproceeding, of course, requires a hatching house specially built and\r\narranged, and as this is outside the scope of the present work, I would\r\nrefer my readers to larger works upon the subject, such as _An Angler's\r\nParadise_, by J. J. Armistead. Of course, by using a hatchery a large\r\nnumber of the eggs will be saved, ninety per cent. of them should hatch\r\nout. This is, therefore, obviously the best way to proceed. A very much\r\nlarger number of eggs will, however, be hatched out in properly-chosen\r\nartificial beds than would be the case if they were left to nature.\r\n\r\nThe necessary qualities of a good artificial bed are, a good supply of\r\nclean water which is not liable if there is a spate to deposit sediment\r\non the eggs, protection from light, and protection from the many\r\ncreatures which prey upon the ova. The hatching beds may be so arranged\r\nthat the young fish may escape as soon as they like after hatching out,\r\nbut it is best to watch and protect them for at any rate the first few\r\nweeks after they have begun to feed, and while continuing the feeding,\r\nto allow those of the fish that wish to escape.\r\n\r\nThe rearing of young salmon and sea-trout is practically the same as\r\nthat of the common trout, except that they require more water. If kept\r\nin rearing ponds they grow more quickly than they do when left to find\r\nfood for themselves. While young, the salmon is marked with transverse\r\nbars of a darker colour than the rest of the body. During the time it\r\nbears these marks it is known as a parr.[3] In about fifteen months it\r\nloses these marks and becomes quite silvery, being now known as a smolt.\r\nShortly after assuming the smolt dress, the young salmon takes its\r\ndeparture to the sea. In some cases the young salmon do not appear to go\r\ndown to the sea till over two years after being hatched out, but they\r\nshould always be set at liberty in March, April, or May in the year\r\nfollowing that in which they were hatched out, according to how far they\r\nhave developed the smolt or silver appearance.\r\n\r\n[3] All the trouts go through this stage, which is distinguished by\r\n\"finger marks\" upon the sides.\r\n\r\nIf spring water is obtainable, particularly if the water, as is usually\r\nthe case, is of an even temperature throughout the year, the troubles of\r\nthe fish culturist are considerably lessened. Without a building for the\r\nhatching troughs it is almost impossible in many places to guard against\r\nfrost unless such a spring is available. Sediment may be avoided by\r\nputting frames covered with flannel at the inlets to the hatching beds,\r\nthese will, if kept clean, prevent any sediment from coming into the\r\nponds, and will allow plenty of water to flow in. If hatching trays are\r\nnot used, the bottom of the artificial bed should be covered with clean\r\ngravel.\r\n\r\nThe time which elapses from the impregnation of the eggs to their\r\nhatching out varies according to the temperature of the water, a fairly\r\naverage time is about ninety days. The ova should be watched during this\r\ntime, and the dead ones removed. For a short time after they are\r\nimpregnated they are fairly hardy, but from then till shortly before\r\nthey hatch out the very slightest concussion will kill or seriously\r\ninjure them.\r\n\r\nThe management of sea-trout ova is similar to that of salmon, and the\r\nova are obtained in the same way. As in the case of the salmon it is\r\nbest to rear the little fish artificially, till they are ready to go\r\ndown to the sea; they will thus escape dangers likely to cause the loss\r\nof about eighty per cent. of their number.\r\n\r\nThe same methods and the same precautions as advised in the chapters on\r\nrearing trout should be adopted in the case of salmon and sea-trout as\r\nfar as is possible, and if this is done a very large percentage of the\r\nova should be successfully reared to the smolt stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCOARSE FISH\r\n\r\n\r\nCompared to what is known about the early part of the life history of\r\nthe _Salmonidæ_, our knowledge of coarse fish is small. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, such lengthy and complicated proceedings as are necessary to\r\nobtain a good stock of trout are not necessary to obtain a good stock of\r\ncoarse fish. If even a few rudd, perch, dace, pike, or carp are put into\r\nwater where they have a good supply of food to begin with, and which is\r\nsuitable otherwise for their well-being, the amateur's chief trouble\r\nafter a few years, if the water is not heavily fished, will be to keep\r\ndown the stock of coarse fish in proportion to the supply of food.\r\n\r\nI have seen many cases where rudd, perch, dace and carp have increased\r\nto an enormous extent from a few fish introduced into the water. Some\r\nfour years ago we put a few small rudd into a mill-pond at home,\r\nthinking that the fry they produced would serve admirably as food to the\r\ntrout which also inhabited the pond. In about twenty months the pond was\r\nfull of small rudd, and last year we netted out many hundred, as the\r\nwater was terribly over-stocked with them. The same thing has happened\r\nin almost every case which has come to my knowledge; that is, of course,\r\nwhere the waters have been stocked with food, and suitable to the fish\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nThe way in which dace will increase when put into a suitable water is,\r\nif possible, even more remarkable than what happens in the case of the\r\nrudd. I will quote one instance, which proves this very conclusively. A\r\nfew years ago there were no dace in the Sussex Ouse. Pike fishermen,\r\nhowever, used to bring live dace to use as baits. Some of these escaped,\r\nor were set free by the fishermen at the end of their day's fishing, and\r\nnow the Sussex Ouse contains more dace for its size than any other river\r\nI have ever seen.\r\n\r\nWhile rudd thrive best in a pond or lake into which a stream flows, dace\r\nrequire a river or stream to do well. They will, however, thrive and\r\nincrease rapidly in a river where trout are not a success. A muddy\r\nbottom with occasional quickly running shallows, seem to constitute the\r\nbest kind of water for dace. The largest, and by far the best\r\nconditioned dace I have seen, have come from the tidal parts of rivers,\r\nwhere the water is brackish at high water. Dace from such a water have\r\nalso the advantage of being very good eating, as they have, as a rule,\r\nnot got the unpleasant muddy taste usual in this fish.\r\n\r\nPerch and pike will thrive both in rivers and in ponds or lakes which\r\nhave a supply of water from a stream or from springs. They both increase\r\nin numbers very rapidly, and when protected, are more likely to require\r\nthinning down every few years, than artificial assistance from the\r\namateur.\r\n\r\nThe king-carp is the best fish for the amateur who wishes to obtain good\r\nbottom fishing from an absolutely stagnant pond. This fish is much\r\nbolder and a more free feeder than the common carp. It increases so\r\nrapidly in numbers, and is a hard fighting and lively fish.\r\n\r\nMost of the coarse fish deposit a much larger number of eggs than do any\r\nof the _Salmonidæ_--that is to say, in proportion to their size. In\r\nstocking a water which contains no fish, the amateur may wish to hurry\r\non the process of nature in the case of coarse fish; and, fortunately,\r\nthis is fairly easily managed. In the case of perch, rudd, pike, and\r\ncarp, but little change of water is required to hatch out the eggs. The\r\neggs of these fish take but a short time to hatch; and if they are\r\nprotected, and this protection is also given to the little fish for a\r\nfew weeks, it will generally be found that an amply sufficient result is\r\nobtained. The eggs should be spread out carefully on wicker-work or the\r\nlids of baskets and kept in the light. A trickle of water which is\r\nsufficient to change the body of water in the pond in which the ova are\r\nput will, as a rule, be enough. The amateur must be careful that the\r\npond in which he hatches the eggs does not contain any of the many\r\nenemies I have described in former chapters. If it is at all possible to\r\nprotect the eggs and the little fish, it is best to hatch out the eggs\r\nin the pond which it is intended to stock, for it is exceedingly\r\ndifficult to keep the newly-hatched fish in a rearing-pond on account of\r\ntheir very small size. It will be necessary to use muslin or flannel\r\nscreens instead of perforated zinc. Care must be taken that there is not\r\ntoo great a flow of water, as this will cause the little fish to be\r\ndrowned at the outlet screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF EARTH IN REARING PONDS\r\n\r\n[From a correspondence upon the subject which appeared in _Land and\r\nWater_]\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--In your last issue I have read with pleasure the eminently\r\npractical notes on fish culture by Mr. Charles Walker. He is perfectly\r\nright in all he says with reference to the useful and preventive results\r\nof the use of \"common garden\" earth, or vegetable mould in checking any\r\nfungoid development, _Saprolegnia_ or other. It must, however, be\r\nadmitted that the said addition is not an element of beauty in a box;\r\ntherefore it should be avoided, or only used when necessity dictates.\r\nHowever, the fry, when thoroughly restored to health, may be transferred\r\nby muslin net to another box free from earth should it be necessary to\r\ncount out certain numbers for the satisfaction of customers' orders.\r\nAgain, the earth employed may, and in some waters does, give rise to\r\nother ill effects on the health of the \"fry\" or young fishes. Affection\r\nof the eye is not unheard of as the result of over-use of earth. Perhaps\r\nthe best way to obviate any trouble of this nature would be to pound and\r\ndry the earth, and keep it in a canister or other closed vessel till\r\nrequired for use. Spores of fungi are nearly, if not quite, omnipresent;\r\nand their effects are so insidious that too many precautions cannot\r\nwell be taken to avert the introduction of \"trouble\" in the hatchery.\r\nIndeed, were it not for the risks arising from attacks of fungi,\r\npisciculture, as now understood and carried on, would be an unalloyed\r\npleasure and unbounded success. We can practically hatch 995 out of\r\n1,000 eggs, or thereabouts. It is the risks of rearing that stand in our\r\nroad, and these, as time goes on, and experience increases, must\r\ndiminish. There would appear, then, to be a good time coming for fish\r\nculture, and those who earnestly follow it.\r\n\r\nPractice is the only safe guide, as circumstances, geological, physical,\r\nand meteorological so vary the conditions of works that no definite rule\r\nof procedure will avail. Earnest work and close observation, combined\r\nwith ready resource, are the only safe guides to success. Troubles of\r\nsome sort are sure to supervene; the man who succeeds is he who can\r\nanticipate, and so remedy them. To be always on the watch and notice the\r\nfirst indication is a very safe maxim, more easy to inculcate than to\r\nput in practice.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question but that the practical removal of difficulties\r\nin the path of fish culture is work of the highest value, well worthy\r\nthe attention and acknowledgment of those in authority at Whitehall and\r\nelsewhere at home, as has been the case abroad.\r\n\r\nC. C. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your correspondent \"C. C. C.\" in _Land and Water_ of last week\r\ndisagrees with the constant and free use of earth, which I had advocated\r\nin my article on fish culture which appeared the preceding week.\r\nNaturally one must admit that earth at the bottom of a pond is not so\r\ngreat an element of beauty as is clean gravel, but the advantages are so\r\nmany, that beauty must give way to usefulness. Besides this, \"C. C. C.\"\r\nmust know that it is almost impossible to keep the gravel clean enough\r\nto look pretty, when the water is inhabited by a large number of little\r\nfish which are being constantly fed. I cannot at all agree with his\r\nadvice that \"earth should be avoided, or only used when necessity\r\ndictates.\" I believe that one of the first principles of success in fish\r\nculture is always to prevent any disease or mishap, rather than to wait\r\nfor, and then try to remedy it. Trout in their natural surroundings get\r\na dose of earth every time that there is a spate. It is very evident\r\nthat the earth contains some ingredients which are not only beneficial\r\nbut almost a necessity to the fish.\r\n\r\nI have never heard of earth as an actual cure for \"fungus\" and should\r\nhardly think that it is active enough. There is, however, no doubt that\r\nit is one of the best preventatives to \"fungus,\" for if it is properly\r\nand freely used it stops all chance of any decomposing material being\r\nexposed to the action of the water, and laying the fish open to the\r\nchance of a great many evils.\r\n\r\nIf suitable earth is used once a week, and even oftener on occasions, it\r\ncan do no harm, and will keep the fish safe from a great many risks\r\nbesides doing them very material good. I do not of course mean that the\r\nusual weekly dose should be a large one, as this would fill up the pond\r\nbefore the end of the season, but that a small dose should be given\r\ngenerally, and a large dose occasionally. I am quite sure, too, that\r\nclean earth with some nice weeds growing in it, looks better than gravel\r\nwhich is dirty. Gravel shows the dirt so much, that it is almost\r\nimpossible to keep it looking nice where there are many fish, and it\r\nalso gives the water free access to any decomposing matter.\r\n\r\nI have never come across a case of disease caused by the use of earth,\r\nand should like to hear the details of \"C. C. C.'s\" experiences with\r\nregard to this matter.\r\n\r\nCHARLES WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Advantages of rainbow trout, 72-5\r\n\r\n  Air bubble in yolk sac, 40\r\n\r\n  Alders round rearing ponds, 32\r\n    at water side, importance of, 19\r\n\r\n  Alevins, 39-41\r\n    diseases of, 40-1\r\n\r\n  Alpine char, 78\r\n\r\n  American brook trout, 15\r\n    rearing of, 75-6\r\n    spawning of, 76\r\n\r\n  Aquatic creatures, serving as food for fish, 10-2, 62-6\r\n\r\n  Aquatic plants suitable for deep water, 13\r\n    suitable for margins, 13\r\n\r\n  Aquatic vegetation, importance of, 7\r\n    development of, 9\r\n\r\n  Arrangement of rearing boxes, 34\r\n\r\n  Artificial spawning of salmon, 83-4\r\n\r\n  _Asellus aquaticus_, 65\r\n\r\n\r\n  Black spotted trout of the Rocky Mountains, 76-8\r\n\r\n  Blue swelling, 41\r\n\r\n  Breeding char, difficulties in, 78-80\r\n\r\n  Breeding.
