From this point radiate the chief mountain\r\nranges, and three of the longest rivers of the Continent--the Missouri,\r\nthe Columbia, and the Colorado.\r\n\r\nOn the south are the Wind River Mountains, a snow-clad barrier which no\r\nwhite man has ever crossed. On the east is the Snowy Mountain Range,\r\nand the grand cluster of volcanic peaks between it and Yellowstone\r\nLake. On the west is the main divide of the Rocky Mountains. On the\r\nnorth are the bold peaks of the Gallatin Range, and the parallel\r\nridges which give a northward direction to all the great tributaries of\r\nthe Missouri from this region.\r\n\r\nSet like a gem in the centre of this snow-rimmed crown of the\r\ncontinent, is the loveliest body of fresh water on the globe, its\r\ndark-blue surface at an elevation greater than that of the highest\r\nclouds that fleck the azure sky of a summer's day, over the tops of the\r\nloftiest mountains of the East. Its waters teem with trout, and the\r\nprimeval forests that cover the surrounding country are crowded with\r\ngame. But these are the least of its attractions. It is the wildness\r\nand grandeur of the enclosing mountain scenery, and still more the\r\ncurious, beautiful, wonderful and stupendous natural phenomena which\r\ncharacterize the region, that have raised it to sudden fame, and caused\r\nit to be set apart by our national government as a grand national\r\nplay-ground and museum of unparalleled, indeed incomparable, marvels,\r\nfree to all men for all time.\r\n\r\nEvidences of ancient volcanic action on the grandest scale are so\r\nabundant and striking throughout the lake basin, that it has been\r\nlooked upon as the remains of a mammoth crater, forty miles across.\r\nIt seems, however, to have been rather the focus of a multitude of\r\ncraters. \"It is probable,\" says the United States geologist, Dr.\r\nHayden, with his usual caution, \"that during the Pliocene period the\r\nentire country drained by the sources of the Yellowstone and the\r\nColumbia was the scene of volcanic activity as great as that of any\r\nportion of the globe. It might be called one vast crater, made up of a\r\nthousand smaller volcanic vents and fissures, out of which the fluid\r\ninterior of the earth, fragments of rock and volcanic dust, were poured\r\nin unlimited quantities. Hundreds of the nuclei or cones of these\r\nvolcanic vents are now remaining, some of them rising to a height of\r\n10,000 to 11,000 feet above the sea. Mounts Doane, Longford, Stevenson,\r\nand more than a hundred other peaks, may be seen from any high point on\r\neither side of the basin, each of which formed a centre of effusion.\"\r\n\r\nAll that is left of the terrific forces which threw up these lofty\r\nmountains and elevated the entire region to its present altitude, now\r\nfinds issue in occasional earthquake shocks, and in the innumerable\r\nhot springs and geysers, whose description makes up so large a portion\r\nof this book of wonders. Nowhere else in the world can the last-named\r\nphenomena be witnessed on so grand a scale, in such limitless variety,\r\nor amid scenes so marvellous in beauty, so wild and unearthly in\r\nsavage grandeur, so fascinating in all that awes or attracts the lover\r\nof the curious, the wonderful, the magnificent in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFIRST EXPLORATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their exploration of the headwaters of the Missouri in the summer\r\nof 1805, the heroic Captains Lewis and Clarke discovered and named the\r\nthree terminal branches of that river--the Jefferson, the Madison, and\r\nthe Gallatin; then ascending the first named to its springs among the\r\nRocky Mountains, they crossed the lofty ridge of the divide and pursued\r\ntheir investigations along the Columbia to the sea. The following\r\nsummer they returned, separately exploring the two main branches of\r\nthe Great River of the Northwest, each perpetuating the name and fame\r\nof his brother explorer by calling a river after him. Ascending the\r\nsouthern, or Lewis Fork, Captain Clarke recrossed the mountains to\r\nWisdom River, (a branch of the Jefferson,) then traversed the country\r\nof the Jefferson, the Madison and the Gallatin to the Rochejaune, or\r\nYellowstone, which he followed to its junction with the Missouri, where\r\nhe rejoined Captain Lewis. The map of the country explored by these\r\nbrave men, makes the source of the Yellowstone a large lake, doubtless\r\nfrom information received from the Indians, but they seem to have heard\r\nnothing of the marvels along the upper reaches of the river and around\r\nthe lake from which it flows.\r\n\r\nIn later years--especially after the discovery of the Montana\r\ngold-mines had drawn to the upper valleys of the Missouri an\r\nadventurous, gold-seeking population, who scoured the mountains in\r\nall directions--rumors of burning plains, spouting springs, great\r\nlakes and other natural wonders, came down from the unknown regions\r\nup the Yellowstone. And not content with these, the imagination was\r\nfreely drawn on, and the treasure valleys of the Arabian Nights were\r\nrivalled, if not reproduced. Our over-venturous party, hotly pursued\r\nby Indians, escaped, report said, by travelling night after night by\r\nthe brilliant light of a huge diamond providentially exposed on a\r\nmountain. A lost trapper turned up after protracted wandering in this\r\nmysterious region, his pockets stuffed with nuggets of gold gathered in\r\na stream which he could never find again. More astounding still was\r\na valley which instantly petrified whatever entered it. Rabbits and\r\nsage-hens, even Indians were standing about there, like statuary, among\r\nthickets of petrified sage-brush, whose stony branches bore diamonds,\r\nrubies, sapphires, emeralds and other gems by the thousand, as large\r\nas walnuts. \"I tell you, sir,\" said one who had been there, to Colonel\r\nRaynolds, \"it is true, for I gathered a quart myself and sent them down\r\nthe country.\"\r\n\r\nThe first earnest attempt to explore the valley of the upper\r\nYellowstone was made in 1859, by Colonel Raynolds, of the Corps of\r\nEngineers. His expedition passed entirely around the Yellowstone basin,\r\nbut could not penetrate it. In his report to the War Department, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"It was my original desire to go from the head of Wind River to the\r\nhead of the Yellowstone, keeping on the Atlantic slope, thence down\r\nthe Yellowstone, passing the lake, and across by the Gallatin to the\r\nthree forks of the Missouri. Bridger said at the outset that this\r\nwould be impossible, and that it would be necessary to cross over to\r\nthe headwaters of the Columbia and back again to the Yellowstone.\r\nI had not previously believed that crossing the main crest twice\r\nwould be more easily accomplished than the transit over what was\r\nin effect only a spur; but the view from our first camp settled the\r\nquestion adversely to my opinion at once. Directly across our route\r\nlies a basaltic ridge, rising not less than 5,000 feet above us, its\r\nwalls apparently vertical, with no visible pass or even cañon. On the\r\nopposite side of this are the headwaters of the Yellowstone. Bridger\r\nremarked triumphantly and forcibly on reaching this spot, 'I told you\r\nyou could not go through. A bird can't fly over that without taking a\r\nsupply of grub along.' I had no reply to offer, and mentally conceded\r\nthe accuracy of the information of 'the old man of the mountains.' * *\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\"After this obstacle had thus forced us over on the western slope\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, an effort was made to recross and reach the\r\ndistrict in question, but although it was June, the immense body of\r\nsnow baffled all our exertions, and we were compelled to content\r\nourselves with listening to marvellous tales of burning plains,\r\nimmense lakes, and boiling springs, without being able to verify these\r\nwonders. I know of but two white men who claim to ever have visited\r\nthis part of the Yellowstone Valley--James Bridger and Robert Meldrum.\r\nThe narratives of both these men are very remarkable, and Bridger, in\r\none of his recitals, described an immense boiling spring, that is a\r\nperfect counterpart of the Geysers of Iceland. As he is uneducated,\r\nand had probably never heard of the existence of such natural marvels\r\nelsewhere, I have little doubt that he spoke of that which he had\r\nactually seen. The burning plains described by these men may be\r\nvolcanic, or, more probably, burning beds of lignite similar to those\r\non Powder River, which are known to be in a state of ignition.... Had\r\nour attempt to enter this district been made a month later in the\r\nseason, the snow would have mainly disappeared, and there would have\r\nbeen no insurmountable obstacles to overcome.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot doubt, therefore, that at no very distant day the mysteries\r\nof this region will be fully revealed, and though small in extent, I\r\nregard the valley of the upper Yellowstone as the most interesting\r\nunexplored district of our widely expanded country.\"\r\n\r\nTen years after Colonel Raynolds's unsuccessful attempt to solve the\r\nproblem of the Yellowstone, a small party under Messrs. Cook and Folsom\r\nascended the river to the lake, and crossed over the divide into the\r\nGeyser Basin of the Madison. No report, we believe, was published of\r\ntheir discoveries. At any rate, the general public were indebted for\r\ntheir first knowledge of the marvels of this region to an expedition\r\norganized in the summer of 1870 by some of the officials and leading\r\ncitizens of Montana. This company, led by General Washburn, the\r\nSurveyor-General of the Territory, and accompanied by a small escort\r\nof United States cavalry under Lieutenant G. C. Doane, left Fort Ellis\r\ntoward the latter part of August, and entered the valley of Yellowstone\r\nRiver on the 23d. During the next thirty days they explored the cañons\r\nof the Yellowstone and the shores of Yellowstone Lake; then crossing\r\nthe mountains to the headwaters of the Madison, they visited the geyser\r\nregion of Firehole River, and ascended that stream to its junction\r\nwith the Madison, along whose valley they returned to civilization,\r\nconfident, as their historian wrote, that they had seen \"the greatest\r\nwonders on the Continent,\" and \"convinced that there was not on the\r\nglobe another region where, within the same limits, nature had crowded\r\nso much of grandeur and majesty, with so much of novelty and wonder.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Langford's account of this expedition, published in the second\r\nvolume of _Scribner's Monthly_, and the report of Lieutenant Doane,\r\nprinted some time after by the United States Government, (Ex. Doc. No.\r\n51, 41st Congress,) gave to the world the first authentic information\r\nof the marvels of this wonderful region. Though their route lay\r\nthrough a terrible wilderness, and most of the party were but amateur\r\nexplorers at best, only one (Mr. Everts) met with a serious mishap.\r\nThis gentleman's story of his separation from the company, and his\r\nthirty-seven days of suffering and perilous wandering, is one of the\r\nmost thrilling chapters of adventure ever written.\r\n\r\nThe path fairly broken, and the romance of the Yellowstone shown to\r\nhave a substantial basis in reality, it was not long before others were\r\nready to explore more fully the magnificent scenery and the strange and\r\npeculiar phenomena described by the adventurers of 1870. As soon as the\r\nfollowing season was sufficiently advanced to admit of explorations\r\namong the mountains, the Chief Engineer of the Military Department of\r\nthe Missouri, Brevet Colonel John W. Barlow, set out for a two months'\r\nsurvey of the Yellowstone Basin, under special orders from General\r\nSheridan. His route lay along the river to the lake; thence along the\r\nnorthern shore of the lake to the hot springs on its western bank;\r\nthence across the mountains westward to the Geyser Basins of Firehole\r\nRiver, which he ascended to its source in Madison Lake; thence to\r\nHeart Lake, the source of Snake River; thence across the mountains to\r\nBridger's Lake, in the valley of the Upper Yellowstone. Descending\r\nthis stream to where it enters Yellowstone Lake, he returned by the\r\neast shore of the lake to Pelican Creek; thence across the country to\r\nthe Falls of the Yellowstone; thence over the mountains to the East\r\nFork of the Yellowstone, which he followed to its junction with the\r\nmain stream.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, a large and thoroughly-organized scientific party,\r\nunder Dr. F. V. Hayden, U. S. geologist, were making a systematic\r\nsurvey of the region traversed by Colonel Barlow. The work done by this\r\nparty is briefly summarized by Dr. Hayden as follows:\r\n\r\n\"From Fort Ellis, we passed eastward over the divide, between the\r\ndrainage of the Missouri and Yellowstone, to Bottlers' Ranch. Here we\r\nestablished a permanent camp, leaving all our wagons and a portion of\r\nthe party. A careful system of meteorological observations was kept\r\nat this locality for six weeks. From Bottlers' Ranch we proceeded up\r\nthe valley of the Yellowstone, surveyed the remarkable hot springs on\r\nGardiner's River, The Grand Cañon, Tower Falls, Upper and Lower Falls\r\nof the Yellowstone, thence into the basin proper, prepared charts of\r\nall the Hot Spring groups, which were very numerous, and continued up\r\nthe river to the lake. We then commenced a systematic survey of the\r\nlake and its surroundings. Mr. Schönborn, with his assistant, made\r\na careful survey of the lake and the mountains from the shore, and\r\nMessrs. Elliott and Carrington surveyed and sketched its shore-lines\r\nfrom the water in a boat. Careful soundings were also made, and the\r\ngreatest depth was found to be three hundred feet. From the lake I\r\nproceeded, with Messrs. Schönborn, Peale, and Elliott to the Firehole\r\nValley, by way of East Fork of the Madison; then ascended the Firehole\r\nValley. We made careful charts of the Lower and Upper Geyser Basin,\r\nlocating all the principal springs, and determining their temperatures.\r\nWe then returned over the mountains by way of the head of Firehole\r\nRiver, explored Madison Lake, Heart Lake, etc. After having completed\r\nour survey of the lake, we crossed over to the headwaters of the East\r\nFork by way of the valley of Pelican Creek, explored the East Fork to\r\nits junction with the main Yellowstone, and thence to Bottlers' Ranch,\r\nwhich we reached on the 28th of August. From this place we passed down\r\nthe Yellowstone, through the lower cañon, to the mouth of Shield's\r\nRiver, to connect our work with that of Colonel Wm. F. Raynolds, in\r\n1860. From there we returned to Fort Ellis.\"\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that no exploring expedition on this continent ever\r\nhad a more interesting field of investigation, or ever studied so many\r\ngrand, curious and wonderful aspects of nature in so short a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFORT ELLIS TO BOTTLERS' RANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Yellowstone tourist leaves the confines of civilization at Fort\r\nEllis. This frontier military post, situated near the head of the\r\nbeautiful and fertile valley of the East Gallatin, commands the valleys\r\nof the Yellowstone and the three forks of the Missouri--the finest and\r\nmost productive portion of Montana. On the east and north are ranges\r\nof hills and mountains which form the divide between the waters of the\r\nYellowstone and the Missouri. On the south and west, the beautiful\r\nValley of the Gallatin. Abundant vegetation, beautiful scenery, streams\r\nof pure water flowing down the mountain-sides and across the plains on\r\nevery hand, and a climate that can hardly be surpassed in any country,\r\ncombine to make this pleasant station one of the most charming places\r\non the continent.\r\n\r\nFor the first six miles the road from Fort Ellis to the wonder-land of\r\nthe Yellowstone Valley follows the general course of the East Gallatin,\r\nup steep acclivities and through the defiles of a hilly country to the\r\ncrest of the divide. The road here takes advantage of a natural pass\r\nbetween hills that rise from six hundred to twelve hundred feet above\r\nthe road, itself considerably more elevated than the summit of the\r\nWhite Mountains. From the tops of the hills on either side the view\r\nis wonderfully fine in every direction. To the west lies the Gallatin\r\nValley, with its cordon of snow-capped peaks, its finely-timbered water\r\ncourses, and its long, grassy declivities, dotted with the habitations\r\nof pioneers, and blooming with the fruits of industry. To the eastward\r\nlies the beautiful Valley of the Yellowstone, not yet laid under\r\ntribute to man. On the further side of this valley--the bed of an\r\nancient lake--the eye takes in at a glance one of the most symmetrical\r\nand remarkable ranges of mountains in all the West. Indeed, Dr. Hayden\r\nsays, in describing them:\r\n\r\n\"Several of my party who had visited Europe regarded this range as in\r\nno way inferior in beauty to any in that far-famed country. A series of\r\ncone-shaped peaks, looking like gigantic pyramids, are grouped along\r\nthe east side of the valley for thirty or forty miles, with their bald,\r\ndark summits covered with perpetual snow, the vegetation growing\r\nthinner and smaller as we ascend the almost vertical sides, until, long\r\nbefore reaching the summits, it has entirely disappeared. On all sides\r\ndeep gorges have been gashed out by aqueous forces cutting through the\r\nvery core of the mountains, and forming those wonderful gulches which\r\nonly the hardy and daring miner has ventured to explore. This range,\r\nwhich is called on the maps Snowy Mountains, forms the great water-shed\r\nbetween two portions of the Yellowstone River, above and below the\r\nfirst cañon, and gives origin to some of the most important branches\r\nof that river. From the summit of Emigrant Peak, one of the highest\r\nof these volcanic cones, one great mass of these basaltic peaks can\r\nbe seen as far as the eye can reach, rising to the height of 10,000\r\nto 11,000 feet above the sea. Emigrant Peak, the base of which is cut\r\nby the Yellowstone River, is 10,629 feet above tide-water, while the\r\nvalley plain near Bottlers' Ranch, on the opposite side of the river,\r\nwas found to be 5,925 feet. This splendid group of peaks rises 5,000\r\nfeet and upward above the valley of the Yellowstone.\"\r\n\r\nAbout three miles from the divide the road strikes the valley of Trail\r\nCreek, a small-sized trout-stream of great clearness and purity,\r\nflowing southeastward to the Yellowstone, between high hills wooded\r\nat the summits. Approaching the river, the country becomes more and\r\nmore volcanic in appearance, masses of basaltic lava cropping out\r\nfrom the high ridges on the right and left. Many of these masses\r\nshow a perpendicular front of several hundred feet, with projections\r\nresembling towers, castles and the like. Several miles away on the\r\nright, is Pyramid Mountain, a snow-capped peak. Farther to the south is\r\na long range of mountains, also covered with snow, even in midsummer.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the valley the foot hills bear abundant verdure, the\r\nhighest summits being covered with a vigorous growth of pines. Trail\r\nCreek enters the Yellowstone about thirty miles from Fort Ellis. Ten\r\nmiles further up the Yellowstone is Bottlers' Ranch, the last abode of\r\ncivilized man in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe Bottler brothers, who have established themselves here, belong\r\nto that numerous class of pioneers who are satisfied only when their\r\nfield of operation is a little in advance of civilization, exposed to\r\nprivation and danger, yet possessing advantages for hunting, trapping\r\nand fishing not enjoyed by men content to dwell in safety. These,\r\nhowever are not their only occupations. They have under cultivation\r\nlarge fields of wheat, potatoes and other crops, possess extensive\r\nherds of cattle, and make large quantities of butter, for which they\r\nfind a ready market in the mining camps of Emigrant Gulch across the\r\nriver, which at this point is a very rapid stream, about three hundred\r\nfeet wide and four feet deep on the riffles at low water.\r\n\r\nOf this part of the valley Dr. Hayden says: \"It is about fifteen miles\r\nlong, and will average three miles in width; it is well watered, soil\r\nfertile, and in every respect one of the most desirable portions of\r\nMontana. We may not look for any districts favorable for agriculture\r\nin the Yellowstone Valley above the second cañon; but this entire lake\r\nbasin seems admirably adapted for grazing and for the cultivation\r\nof the usual crops of the country. The cereals and the roots have\r\nalready been produced in abundance, especially wheat and potatoes.\r\nThe mountains on either side are covered with snow, to a greater or\r\nless extent, all the year, which in melting feeds the numerous little\r\nstreams that flow down the mountain-sides in the Yellowstone. Hundreds\r\nof springs flow out of the terraces. One terrace near Bottlers' Ranch\r\ngives origin to fifty springs within a mile, and then, all aggregating\r\ntogether in the river bottom, form a large stream. Thus there is the\r\ngreatest abundance of water for irrigation, or for any of the purposes\r\nof settlement. The elevation of the valley at this ranch is 4,925\r\nfeet, and this may be regarded as the average in altitude. But a small\r\nportion of it is occupied as yet, but the time is not far distant when\r\nthe valley will be covered with fine farms and the hills with stock. It\r\nwill always be a region of interest, from the fact that it is probably\r\nthe upper limit of agricultural effort in the Yellowstone Valley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nBOTTLERS' RANCH TO GARDINER'S RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Bottlers' Ranch the wagon road terminates. For the first ten miles\r\nbeyond, the trail runs along the west bank of the river through the\r\nwildest imaginable scenery of rock, river and mountain. The path is\r\nnarrow, rocky and uneven, frequently leading over steep hills of\r\nconsiderable height. From the top of one of these, a bold mountain spur\r\ncoming down to the water's edge, the view up the valley is very fine,\r\nembracing the river fringed with cottonwoods, the foot hills covered\r\nwith luxuriant, many-tinted herbage, and over all the snow-crowned\r\nsummits of the distant mountains. Above this point the valley opens\r\nout to a \"bottom\" of large extent and great beauty. Across the river\r\nthe steep lava mountains come close to the stream, their lofty fronts\r\ncovered with stunted timber. A large portion of the bottom land is\r\nsubject to overflow by the numerous mountain streams that come in from\r\nthe right, and bears an abundance of grass, in many places waist high.\r\nThe river is skirted with shrubbery and cedars, the latter having thick\r\ntrunks, too short for ordinary lumber, yet of beautiful grain for small\r\ncabinet work, and susceptible of exquisite finish.\r\n\r\nAt the head of this valley is the second cañon of the Yellowstone,\r\ngranite walls rising on either side to the height of a thousand feet\r\nor more, and the river dashing through the narrow gorge with great\r\nvelocity. Seen from the lofty mountain spur over which the trail is\r\nforced to pass, the bright green color of the water, and the numerous\r\nripples, capped with white foam, as the roaring torrent rushes around\r\nand over the multitude of rocks that have fallen from above into the\r\nchannel, present a most picturesque appearance. Above the cañon, which\r\nis about a mile in length, the valley widens slightly, then narrows\r\nso as to compel the traveller to cross a ridge, on whose summit lies\r\na beautiful lake. Descending to the valley again the road traverses a\r\ntract of level bottom land, a mile or two wide, covered with a heavy\r\ngrowth of sage-brush. Throughout all this portion of its course, the\r\nYellowstone is abundantly stocked with trout of the largest variety\r\nknown this side the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nSome ten miles above the second cañon on the edge of the river valley\r\nis Cinnabar Mountain, whose weather-beaten side presents one of the\r\nmost singular freaks of nature in the world. Two parallel vertical\r\nwalls of rock, fifty feet wide, traverse the mountain from base to\r\nsummit, and project to the height of three hundred feet for a distance\r\nof fifteen hundred feet. The sides are as even as if wrought by line\r\nand plumb. The rock between the walls and on either side has been\r\ncompletely worn away. Speaking of this curious formation, Mr. Langford\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"We had seen many of the capricious works wrought by erosion upon the\r\nfriable rocks of Montana, but never before upon so majestic a scale.\r\nHere an entire mountain-side, by wind and water, had been removed,\r\nleaving as the evidences of their protracted toil these vertical\r\nprojections, which, but for their immensity, might as readily be\r\nmistaken for works of art as of nature. Their smooth sides, uniform\r\nwidth and height, and great length, considered in connection with\r\nthe causes which had wrought their insulation, excited our wonder\r\nand admiration. They were all the more curious because of their\r\ndissimilarity to any other striking objects in natural scenery that we\r\nhad ever seen or heard of. In future years, when the wonders of the\r\nYellowstone are incorporated into the family of fashionable resorts,\r\nthere will be few of its attractions surpassing in interest this\r\nmarvellous freak of the elements.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of Dr. Hayden, the mountain is formed of\r\nalternate beds of sandstone, limestone, and quartzites, elevated to a\r\nnearly vertical position by those internal forces which acted in ages\r\npast to lift the mountain ranges to their present heights. Standing\r\nat the base and looking up the sides of the mountain, the geologist\r\ncould not but be filled with wonder at the convulsions which threw\r\nsuch immense masses of rocks into their present position. Ridge after\r\nridge extends down the steep sides of the mountain like lofty walls,\r\nthe intervening softer portions having been washed away, leaving the\r\nharder layers projecting far above. In one place the rocks incline\r\nin every possible direction, and are crushed together in the utmost\r\nconfusion. Between the walls at one point is a band of bright brick-red\r\nclay, which has been mistaken for cinnabar, and hence the name Cinnabar\r\nMountain. The most conspicuous ridge is composed of basalt, which\r\nmust have been poured out on the surface when all the rocks were in\r\na horizontal position. For reasons best known to himself, one of the\r\nfirst explorers of this region gave these parallel ridges the title of\r\n\"Devil's Slide.\"\r\n\r\n\"The suggestion was unfortunate,\" writes the historian of the\r\nExpedition, \"as, with more reason perhaps, but with no better taste, we\r\nfrequently had occasion to appropriate other portions of the person of\r\nhis Satanic Majesty, or of his dominion, in signification of the varied\r\nmarvels we met with. Some little excuse may be found for this in the\r\nfact that the old mountaineers and trappers who preceded us had been\r\npeculiarly lavish in the use of the infernal vocabulary. Every river\r\nand glen and mountain had suggested to their imaginations some fancied\r\nresemblance to portions of a region which their pious grandmothers had\r\nwarned them to avoid. It is common for them, when speaking of this\r\nregion, to designate portions of its physical features, as \"Firehole\r\nPrairie,\"--the \"Devil's Den,\"--\"Hell Roaring River,\" etc.--and these\r\nnames, from a remarkable fitness of things, are not likely to be\r\nspeedily superseded by others less impressive.\"\r\n\r\nThese \"impressive\" titles stand in curious contrast with the fanciful\r\nnames bestowed in this region by Capts. Lewis and Clarke,--Wisdom\r\nRiver, Philosophy River, Philanthropy Creek, and the like.\r\n\r\nFrom the Devil's Slide to the mouth of Gardiner's River, twelve miles,\r\nthe ground rises rapidly, passing from a dead level alkali plain, to a\r\nsuccession of plateaus covered slightly with a sterile soil. Evidences\r\nof volcanic action begin to be frequent: old craters converted into\r\nsmall lakes appear here and there, prettily fringed with vegetation,\r\nand covered with waterfowl. Scattered over the hills and through the\r\nvalleys are numerous beautiful specimens of chalcedony and chips of\r\nobsidian. Many of the chalcedonies are geodes, in which are crystals of\r\nquartz; others contain opal in the centre and agate on the exterior;\r\nand still others have on the outside attached crystals of calcite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nHOT SPRINGS OF GARDINER'S RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen miles above the Devil's Slide, Gardiner's River, a mountain torrent\r\ntwenty yards wide, cuts through a deep and gloomy gorge and enters the\r\nYellowstone at the lower end of the Third Cañon.\r\n\r\nAt this point the Yellowstone shrinks to half its usual size, losing\r\nitself among huge granite boulders, which choke up the stream and\r\ncreate alternate pools and rapids, crowded with trout. Worn into\r\nfantastic forms by the washing water, these immense rock masses give\r\nan aspect of peculiar wildness to the scenery. But the crowning wonder\r\nof this region is the group of hot springs on the slope of a mountain,\r\nfour miles up the valley of Gardiner's River. The first expedition\r\npassed on without seeing them, but they could not escape the vigilance\r\nof the scientific company that followed.\r\n\r\nThe lower reaches of the valley of Gardiner's River, and the enclosing\r\nhillsides, are strewn with volcanic rock, having the appearance\r\nof furnace cinder. The tops of the rounded hills are covered with\r\nfragments of basalt and conglomerate, whose great variety of sombre\r\ncolors add much to the appearance of desolation which characterizes\r\nthe valley. Here and there are stagnant lakes fifty to a hundred yards\r\nin diameter, apparently occupying ancient volcanic vents. Crossing a\r\nbarren, elevated region two miles in extent, and three or four hundred\r\nfeet above the river-bed, the trail descends abruptly to a low \"bottom\"\r\ncovered with a thick calcareous crust, deposited from hot springs, now\r\nfor the most part dry. At one point, however, a large stream of hot\r\nwater, six feet wide and two feet deep, flows swiftly from beneath\r\nthe crust, its exposed portion clearly revealed by rising steam. The\r\nquantity of water flowing from this spring is greater than from any\r\nother in this region; its temperature ranges from 126° to 132° Fah. A\r\nlittle further above are three or four other springs near the margin\r\nof the river. These have nearly circular basins, six to ten feet in\r\ndiameter, and a temperature not above 120°. Already these springs have\r\nbecome the resort of invalids, who speak highly of the virtues of the\r\nwaters. A short distance up the hill are abundant remains of springs,\r\nwhich in time past must have been very active. For nearly a mile the\r\nsteep hill-side is covered with a thick crust of spring deposits,\r\nwhich, though much decomposed and overgrown with pines and cedars,\r\nstill bear traces of the wonderful forms displayed in the vicinity\r\nof the active springs further up the hill. Ascending the hill, Dr.\r\nHayden's party came suddenly and unexpectedly upon these marvellous\r\ndeposits, which they agreed in pronouncing one of the finest displays\r\nof natural architecture in the world. The snowy whiteness of the\r\ndeposit, which has the form of a frozen cascade, at once suggested\r\nthe name of White Mountain Hot Spring. The springs now in active\r\noperation cover an area of about one square mile, while the rest of\r\nthe territory, three or four square miles in extent, is occupied by the\r\nremains of springs which have ceased to flow. Small streams flow down\r\nthe sides of the Snowy Mountain in channels lined with oxide of iron of\r\nthe most delicate tints of red. Others show exquisite shades of yellow,\r\nfrom a deep, bright sulphur, to a dainty cream-color. Still others are\r\nstained with shades of green, all these colors as brilliant as the\r\nbrightest aniline dyes. The water after rising from the spring basin\r\nflows down the sides of the declivity, step by step, from one reservoir\r\nto another, at each one of them losing a portion of its heat, until it\r\nbecomes as cool as spring-water. Within five hundred feet of its source\r\nDr. Hayden's party camped for two days by the side of the little stream\r\nformed by the aggregated waters of these hot springs, and found the\r\nwater most excellent for drinking as well as for cooking purposes. It\r\nwas perfectly clear and tasteless, and harmless in its effects. During\r\ntheir stay here all the members of the party, as well as the soldiers\r\ncomprising their escort, enjoyed the luxury of bathing in these most\r\nelegantly carved natural bathing-pools; and it was easy to select, from\r\nthe hundreds of reservoirs, water of any desired temperature. These\r\nnatural basins vary somewhat in size, but many of them are about four\r\nby six feet in diameter, and one to four feet in depth. Their margins\r\nare beautifully scalloped, and adorned with a natural beadwork of\r\nexquisite beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATHING-POOLS (DIANA'S BATH.)]\r\n\r\nThe level or terrace upon which the principal active springs are\r\nlocated, is about midway up the sides of the mountain, covered with the\r\nsediment. Still farther up are the ruins of what must have been at\r\nsome period more active springs than any at present known. The sides\r\nof the mountain for two or three hundred feet in height, are thickly\r\nencrusted with calcareous deposit, originally ornamented with elegant\r\nsculpturing, like the bathing pools below; but atmospheric agencies,\r\nwhich act readily on the lime, have obliterated all their delicate\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe largest living spring is near the outer margin of the main\r\nterrace. Its dimensions are twenty-five feet by forty, and its water\r\nso perfectly transparent that one can look down into the beautiful\r\nultramarine depth to the very bottom of the basin. Its sides are\r\nornamented with coral-like forms of a great variety of shades, from\r\npure white to a bright cream yellow, while the blue sky reflected in\r\nthe transparent water gives an azure tint to the whole which surpasses\r\nall art. From various portions of the rim, water flows out in moderate\r\nquantities over the sides of the hill. Whenever it gathers into a\r\nchannel and flows quite swiftly, basins with sides from two to eight\r\nfeet high are formed with their ornamental designs proportionately\r\ncoarse; but when the water flows slowly, myriads of little basins\r\nare formed, one below another, with a semblance of irregular system.\r\nThe water holds in solution a great amount of lime, with some soda,\r\nalumina and magnesia, which are slowly deposited as the water flows\r\ndown the sides of the mountain. Underneath the sides of many of the\r\npools are rows of exquisitely-ornamented stalactites, formed by the\r\ndripping of the water over the margins. All these springs have one or\r\nmore centres of ebullition which is constant, though seldom rising\r\nmore than four or five inches above the surface. The ebullition is due\r\nmainly to the emission of carbonic acid gas. The springs in the centre\r\nof the main basin are probably all at the boiling point--194° at this\r\nelevation. Being inaccessible, however, it is impossible to determine\r\ntheir actual temperature. The hottest that could be reached was 162°\r\nFah. The terrace immediately above the main basin is bordered by a long\r\nrounded ridge with a fissure extending its whole length, its interior\r\nlined with beautiful crystals of pure sulphur. Only hot vapors and\r\nsteam issue from this fissure, though the bubbling and gurgling of\r\nwater far beneath the surface can be distinctly heard. Back of this\r\nridge are several small springs which throw up geyser-like jets of\r\nwater intermittently to the height of three feet.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of this deposit, about one-third of the way up the\r\nWhite Mountain from the river and terrace, where was once the theatre\r\nof many active springs, old chimneys or craters are scattered thickly\r\nover the surface, and there are several large holes and fissures\r\nleading to vast caverns below. The crust gives off a dull hollow sound\r\nbeneath the tread, and the surface gives indistinct evidence of having\r\nbeen adorned with the beautiful pools or basins already described. At\r\nthe base of the principal terrace is a large area covered with shallow\r\npools some of them containing water, with all the ornamentations\r\nperfect, while others are fast going to decay, and the decomposed\r\nsediment is as white as snow. On this sub-terrace is a remarkable cone\r\nabout 50 feet in height and 20 feet in diameter at the base. Its form\r\nhas suggested the name of Liberty Cap. It is undoubtedly the remains\r\nof an extinct geyser. The water was forced up with considerable power,\r\nand probably without intermission, building up its own crater until\r\nthe pressure beneath was exhausted, and the spring gradually closed\r\nitself over at the summit and perished. No water flows from it at the\r\npresent time. The layers of lime were deposited around the cap like\r\nthe layers of straw on a thatched roof, or hay on a conical stack. Not\r\nfar from the Liberty Cap is a smaller cone, called, from its form, the\r\n\"Bee-hive.\" These springs are constantly changing their position; some\r\ndie out, others burst out in new places. On the northwest margin of\r\nthe main terrace are examples of what have been called oblong mounds.\r\nThere are several of them in this region, extending in different\r\ndirections, from fifty to one hundred and fifty yards in length, from\r\nsix to ten feet high, and from ten to fifteen feet broad at the base.\r\nThere is in all cases a fissure from one end of the summit to the\r\nother, usually from six to ten inches wide, from which steam sometimes\r\nissues in considerable quantities, and on walking along the top one\r\ncan hear the water seething and boiling below like a cauldron. The\r\ninner portion of the shell, as far down as can be seen, is lined with\r\na hard, white enamel-like porcelain; in some places beautiful crystals\r\nof sulphur have been precipitated from the steam. These mounds have\r\nbeen built up by a kind of oblong fissure-spring in the same way that\r\nthe cones have been constructed. The water, continually spouting up,\r\ndeposited sediment around the edges of the fissure until the force was\r\nexhausted, and then the calcareous basin was rounded up something like\r\na thatched roof by overlapping layers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LIBERTY CAP.]\r\n\r\nNear the upper terrace, which is really an old rim, are a number of\r\nthese extinct, oblong geysers, some of which have been broken down\r\nso as to show them to be mere shells or caverns, now the abode of\r\nwild animals. Dr. Hayden attempted to enter one of them, and found it\r\nfull of sticks and bones which had been carried in by wild beasts;\r\nand swarms of bats flitted to and fro. Some of the mounds have been\r\nworn away so that sections are exposed, showing the great number\r\nand thickness of the overlapping layers of sediment. Many mounds\r\nare overgrown with pine-trees, which must be at least eighty or a\r\nhundred years old. Indeed, the upper part of this mountain appears\r\nlike a magnificent ruin of a once flourishing village of these unique\r\nstructures, now fast decomposing, yet beautiful and instructive\r\nin their decay. One may now study the layers of deposit, sometimes\r\nthousands on a single mound, as he would the rings of growth in a\r\ntree. How long a period is required to form one of these mounds, or to\r\nbuild up its beautiful structure, there is no data for determining. On\r\nthe middle terrace, where the principal portion of the active springs\r\nare, some of the pine-trees are buried in sediment apparently to the\r\ndepth of six or eight feet. All of them are dead at the present time.\r\nThere is, however, evidence enough around the springs to show that\r\nthe mineral-water is precipitated with great rapidity. It is probable\r\nthat all the deposits in the immediate vicinity of the active springs\r\nare constantly changing from the margin of the river to the top of the\r\nWhite Mountain and return. The deposits upon the summit are extensive,\r\nthough now there is very little water issuing from the springs there,\r\nand that is of low temperature. Quantities of steam are ever ascending\r\nfrom the springs, and on damp mornings the entire slope of the mountain\r\nis enveloped in clouds of vapor.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" observes Dr. Hayden, in summing up his account of this\r\nindescribable locality, \"it is to the wonderful variety of exquisitely\r\ndelicate colors that this picture owes the main part of its\r\nattractiveness. The little orifices from which the hot water issues\r\nare beautifully enamelled with the porcelain-like lining, and around\r\nthe edges a layer of sulphur is precipitated. As the water flows along\r\nthe valley, it lays down in its course a pavement more beautiful and\r\nelaborate in its adornment than art has ever yet conceived. The sulphur\r\nand the iron, with the green microscopic vegetation, tint the whole\r\nwith an illumination of which no decoration-painter has ever dreamed.\r\nFrom the sides of the oblong mound, which is here from 30 to 50 feet\r\nhigh, the water has oozed out at different points, forming small groups\r\nof the semicircular, step-like basins.\r\n\r\n\"Again, if we look at the principal group of springs from the high\r\nmound above the middle terrace, we can see the same variety of\r\nbrilliant coloring. The wonderful transparency of the water surpasses\r\nanything of the kind I have ever seen in any other portion of the\r\nworld. The sky, with the smallest cloud that flits across it, is\r\nreflected in its clear depths, and the ultramarine colors, more\r\nvivid than the sea, are greatly heightened by the constant gentle\r\nvibrations. One can look down into the clear depths and see, with\r\nperfect distinctness, the minutest ornament on the inner sides of the\r\nbasins; and the exquisite beauty of the coloring and the variety of\r\nforms baffle any attempt to portray them, either with pen or pencil.\r\nAnd then, too, around the borders of these springs, especially those\r\nof rather low temperature, and on the sides and bottoms of the numerous\r\nlittle channels of the streams that flow from these springs, there is\r\na striking variety of the most vivid colors. I can only compare them\r\nto our most brilliant aniline dyes--various shades of red, from the\r\nbrightest scarlet to a bright rose tint; also yellow, from deep-bright\r\nsulphur, through all the shades, to light cream-color. There are also\r\nvarious shades of green, from the peculiar vegetation. These springs\r\nare also filled with minute vegetable forms, which under the microscope\r\nprove to be diatoms, among which Dr. Billings discovers _Palmella_\r\nand _Oscillara_. There are also in the little streams that flow from\r\nthe boiling springs great quantities of a fibrous, silky substance,\r\napparently vegetable, which vibrates at the slightest movement of the\r\nwater, and has the appearance of the finest quality of cashmere wool.\r\nWhen the waters are still these silken masses become incrusted with\r\nlime, the delicate vegetable threads disappear, and a fibrous, spongy\r\nmass remains, like delicate snow-white coral.\"\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of these springs is a question of great interest, yet\r\ndifficult of solution. When were these immense deposits begun? On the\r\nmargin of the mountain, high above the present position of the hot\r\nsprings, is a bed of white, or yellowish white limestone, from fifty\r\nto a hundred and fifty feet thick. It is regularly stratified and the\r\njointing is complete. There is a belt a mile long and one fourth of a\r\nmile wide, covered with cubical masses of this rock that have fallen\r\ndown the slope of the mountain. These immense blocks, fifty to one\r\nhundred feet in each dimension, appear as if the mass had slowly fallen\r\ndown as the underlying rocks were worn away. So thickly is this belt\r\ncovered with these huge masses that it is with the greatest difficulty\r\none can walk across it. It would seem that this bed must at one time\r\nhave extended over a portion or all of the valley of Gardiner's\r\nRiver. Much of the rock is very compact, and would make beautiful\r\nbuilding-stone, on account of its close texture and color, and it could\r\nbe converted into the whitest of lime. If the rocks are examined,\r\nhowever, over a considerable area, they are found to possess all the\r\nvarieties of structure of a hot-spring deposit. Some portions are quite\r\nspongy, and decompose readily; others are made up of very thin laminæ,\r\nregular or wavy; enough to show the origin of the deposit without a\r\ndoubt. But in what manner was it formed? Dr. Hayden believes that the\r\nlimestone was precipitated in the bottom of a lake, which was filled\r\nwith hot-springs, much as the calcareous matter is laid down in the\r\nbottom of the ocean at the present time. Indeed, portions of the rock\r\ndo not differ materially from the recent limestones now forming in the\r\nvicinity of the West India Islands. The deposit was evidently laid down\r\non a nearly level surface, with a moderately uniform thickness, and\r\nthe strata are horizontal. Since this group of strata was formed, the\r\ncountry has been elevated, and the valley of Gardiner's River has been\r\ncarved out, so that the commencement of the period of activity of these\r\nsprings must date back to a period merging on, but just prior to, the\r\npresent geological period--probably at the time of the greatest action\r\nof the volcanic forces in this region.\r\n\r\nClassed with reference to their chemical constituents, the springs here\r\nand elsewhere in the Yellowstone Valley are of two kinds: those in\r\nwhich lime predominates, and those in which silica is most abundant.\r\nThe springs of Gardiner's River are mainly the former. Where does the\r\nlime come from? The geology of the country surrounding the springs\r\nshows already that there is underneath the spring deposits, at least a\r\nthickness of 1,500 feet, of carboniferous limestone; and if the origin\r\nof the heat which so elevates the temperature of the waters of these\r\nsprings is as deep seated as is generally supposed, the heated waters\r\nhave ample time and space for dissolving the calcareous rocks through\r\nwhich they flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nGARDINER'S RIVER TO GRAND CAÑON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a mile above the springs, Gardiner's River separates into three\r\nbranches--the East, Middle, and West Forks, which rise high up in the\r\nmountains, among perpetual snows. They wind their way across a broad\r\nplateau covered mostly with a dense growth of pines, but with some\r\nbroad, open, meadow-like spots, which, seen from some high mountain\r\npeak, lend a rare charm to the landscape. After gathering a sufficient\r\nsupply of water, they commence wearing their channels down into the\r\nvolcanic rocks, deeper and deeper as they descend. Each one has its\r\nwater-fall, which would fill an artist with enthusiasm. From the high\r\nridge between the East and Middle Forks a fine view is obtained of the\r\nsurrounding country.\r\n\r\nFar to the southwest are lofty peaks covered with snow, rising to the\r\nheight of 10,000 feet, and forming a part of the magnificent range\r\nof mountains that separates the Yellowstone from the sources of the\r\nGallatin. From this high ridge one can look down into the chasm of the\r\nMiddle Fork, carved out of the basalt and basaltic conglomerates to\r\nthe depth of 500 to 800 feet, with nearly vertical sides. In the sides\r\nof this cañon, as well as those of the East Fork, splendid examples of\r\nbasaltic columns are displayed, as perfect as those of the celebrated\r\nFingal's Cave. They usually appear in regular rows, vertical, five and\r\nsix sided, but far more sharply cut than elsewhere seen in the West,\r\nthough occasionally the columns are spread out in the form of a fan.\r\nSometimes there are several rows, usually about fifty feet high, one\r\nabove the other, with conglomerate between.\r\n\r\nThe cañon is about 500 yards from margin to margin at top, but narrows\r\ndown until on the bottom it is not more than forty yards wide. At one\r\npoint the water pours over a declivity of 300 feet or more, forming a\r\nmost beautiful cascade. The direct fall is over 100 feet. The constant\r\nroar of the water is like that of a train of cars in motion. The pines\r\nare very dense, usually of moderate size, and among them are many open\r\nspaces, covered with stout grass, sometimes with large sage-bushes.\r\nUpon the high hills the vegetation is remarkably luxuriant, indicating\r\ngreat fertility of soil, which is usually very thick, and made up\r\nmostly of degraded igneous rocks. Above the falls the rows of vertical,\r\nbasaltic columns continue in the walls of the cañon, and they may well\r\nbe ranked among the remarkable wonders of this rare wonder-land. The\r\nlower portion of the cañon is composed of rather coarse igneous rocks,\r\nwhich have a jointage and a style of weathering like granite. The West\r\nFork rolls over a bed of basalt, which is divided into blocks that give\r\nthe walls the appearance of mason-work on a gigantic scale. Below the\r\nfalls the river has cut the sides of the mountain, exposing a vertical\r\nsection 400 feet high, with the same irregular jointage.\r\n\r\nSouth of the hot springs is a round dome-like mountain, rising 2,100\r\nfeet above them, or 8,500 feet above the sea. Its summit commands a\r\nprospect from thirty to fifty miles in every direction. To the north\r\nand west stands a group of lofty peaks over 10,000 feet above the\r\nsea, and covered with huge masses of snow. These peaks form a part of\r\nthe range that separates the waters of the Gallatin from those of the\r\nYellowstone. Farther on to the southward are the peaks of the head\r\nof the Madison, and in the interval one black mass of pine forest,\r\ncovering high plateaus, with no point rising over 8,500 feet above the\r\nsea--the whole region being more or less wavy or rolling, interspersed\r\nhere and there with beautiful lakes a few hundred yards in diameter;\r\nand here and there a bright-green grassy valley through which little\r\nstreams wind their way to the large rivers. In one of these lakes the\r\nexplorers saw the greatest abundance of yellow water-lily, which blooms\r\nin great profusion on the surface of all the mountain lakes of the\r\nYellowstone Basin. On the east side of Gardiner's Cañon, and west of\r\nthe Yellowstone, is a sort of wave-like series of ridges, with broad,\r\nopen, grassy interspaces, with many groves of pines. These ridges\r\ngradually slope down to the Yellowstone, northeast. Far to the east and\r\nnorth is one jagged mass of volcanic peaks, some of them snow-clad,\r\nothers bald and desolate to the eye. Far to the south, dimly outlined\r\non the horizon, may be seen the three Tetons and Madison Peak--monarchs\r\nof all the region. A grander view could not well be conceived.\r\n\r\nLeaving Gardiner's River, Dr. Hayden's party ascended the broad slope\r\nof the dividing ridge between that river and the streamlets which flow\r\ninto the Yellowstone. Immense boulders of massive granite, considerably\r\nrounded, are a marked feature of the country about the entrance of\r\nthe East Fork. One of these, a mass of red feldspathic granite, is\r\ntwenty-five feet thick and fifty feet long. The high wavy ridge,\r\n9,000 feet above the sea, is composed of beds of steel-gray and brown\r\nsandstone and calcareous clay, in which are numerous impressions\r\nof deciduous leaves. Vast quantities of silicified wood of great\r\nperfection and beauty are scattered all over the surface. In some cases\r\nlong trees have been turned to agate, the rings of growth as perfectly\r\nshown as in recent wood. The soil is very thick, and covered with\r\nluxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\n\"We were travelling through this region in the latter part of the month\r\nof July,\" writes Dr. Hayden, \"and all the vegetation seemed to be in\r\nthe height of its growth and beauty. The meadows were covered densely\r\nwith grass and flowers of many varieties, and among the pines were\r\ncharming groves of poplars, contrasting strongly by their peculiar\r\nenlivening foliage with the sombre hue of the pines. The climate was\r\nperfect, and in the midst of some of the most remarkable scenery in the\r\nworld, every hour of our march only increased our enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"The climate during the months of June, July, and August, in this\r\nvalley, cannot be surpassed in the world for its health-giving powers.\r\nThe finest of mountain water, fish in the greatest abundance, with\r\na good supply of game of all kinds, fully satisfy the wants of the\r\ntraveller, and render this valley one of the most attractive places of\r\nresort for invalids or pleasure-seekers in America.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of the ridge the party descended to the valley of the\r\nYellowstone, nearly opposite the mouth of the East Fork of that river.\r\nThe road was a rough one. During the period of volcanic action in this\r\nregion, the sedimentary rocks were crumpled into high, sharp, wave-like\r\nseries of ridges; from innumerable fissures, igneous matter was poured\r\nout over the surface cooling into basalt; and from volcanic vents was\r\nalso thrown out, into the great lake, rock fragments and volcanic dust,\r\nwhich were arranged by the water and cemented into a breccia. Deep into\r\nthese ridges the little streams have cut their channels, forming what\r\nshould be called valleys, rather than cañons, with almost vertical\r\nsides. These ravines, 500 to 800 feet deep, covered mostly with grass\r\nor trees, occur in great numbers, many of them entirely dry at present,\r\nbut attesting the presence and power, at no very remote period, of\r\naqueous forces compared with which those of the present are utterly\r\ninsignificant.\r\n\r\nBefore studying this portion of the Yellowstone Valley, it may be well\r\nto retrace our steps to the mouth of Gardiner's River, to explore the\r\nThird Cañon of the Yellowstone, so far as possible, and the rest of its\r\ninteresting valley up to this point.\r\n\r\nAs already noticed, the country about the mouth of Gardiner's River\r\nis desolate and gloomy. The hill-slopes are covered with sage brush,\r\nthe constant sign of arid soil, and grass is scarce. This is the\r\nfirst poor camping-place on the route. The cañon being impassable,\r\nthe trail passes to the right, crossing several high mountain-spurs,\r\nover which the way is much obstructed by fallen timber, and reaching\r\nat last a high rolling plateau. This elevated tract is about thirty\r\nmiles in extent, with a general declivity to the north. Its surface is\r\nan undulating prairie, dotted with groves of pine and aspen. Numerous\r\nlakes are scattered throughout its whole extent, and great numbers of\r\nsprings, which flow down the slopes, are lost in the volume of the\r\nYellowstone. The river breaks through this plateau in a winding cañon\r\nover 2,000 feet in depth--the middle cañon of the Yellowstone rolling\r\nover volcanic boulders in some places, and in others forming still\r\npools of seemingly fathomless depth. At one point it dashes to and fro,\r\nlashed to a white foam on its rocky bed; at another, where a deep basin\r\noccurs in the channel, it subsides into a crystal mirror. Numerous\r\nsmall cascades are seen tumbling from the rocky walls at different\r\npoints and the river appears from the lofty summits a mere ribbon of\r\nfoam in the immeasurable distance below. Standing on the brink of the\r\nchasm the heavy roaring of the imprisoned river comes to the ear only\r\nin a sort of hollow, hungry growl, scarcely audible from the depths.\r\nLofty pines on the bank of the stream \"dwindle to shrubs in dizziness\r\nof distance.\" Everything beneath, says Lieut. Doane, has a weird and\r\ndeceptive appearance. The water does not look like water, but like oil.\r\nNumerous fish-hawks are seen busily plying their vocation, sailing\r\nhigh above the waters, and yet a thousand feet below the spectator. In\r\nthe clefts of the rocks down, hundreds of feet down, bald eagles have\r\ntheir eyries, from which one can see them swooping still farther into\r\nthe depths to rob the ospreys of their hard-earned trout. It is grand,\r\ngloomy, and terrible; a solitude peopled with fantastic ideas; an\r\nempire of shadows and of turmoil.\r\n\r\nThe plateau formation is of lava, generally in horizontal layers, as it\r\ncooled in a surface flow, yet upheaved in many places into wave-like\r\nundulations. Occasionally granite shafts protrude through the strata,\r\nforming landmarks of picturesque form. Like dark icebergs stranded in\r\nan ocean of green, they rise high above the tops of the trees in wooded\r\ndistricts, or stand out grim and solid on the grassy expanse of the\r\nprairies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXTINCT GEYSER, EAST FORK OF THE YELLOWSTONE.]\r\n\r\nNear the head of the Third Cañon a stream flows into the Yellowstone\r\nfrom the northeast, bearing the sonorous title, Hell-Roaring River. It\r\nis quite a large stream, rising high among the mountains, and flowing\r\nwith tremendous impetuosity down the deep gorges. The mountains on\r\neither side come close down to the channel of the Yellowstone, and\r\nare among the most rugged in this rugged region. A huge peak of this\r\nsort, composed of stratified gneiss, with deep strata of massive red\r\nand grey granite, stands at the mouth of Hell-Roaring River, and takes\r\nto itself the same imposing name. A short distance above the mouth of\r\nHell Roaring River, the East Fork of the Yellowstone comes in from\r\nthe southeast. Its sources are high up among the most rugged and\r\ninaccessible portions of the basaltic range, several jagged peaks which\r\nrise from 10,000 to 11,000 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\n\"The summits of these high peaks,\" observes Mr. Hayden, \"are all close,\r\ncompact trachyte, while all around the sides are built up walls of\r\nstratified conglomerate. It is plain that all of them are the nuclei\r\nof old volcanoes. The trachyte may sometimes be concealed by the\r\nconglomerates, but I am inclined to think that each one has formed a\r\ncentre of effusion. Large quantities of silicified wood are found among\r\nthe conglomerates, mostly inclosed in the volcanic cement, evidently\r\nthrown out of the active craters with the fragments of basalt. My\r\nimpression is, that when the old volcanoes disgorged their contents\r\ninto the great lake of waters around, they threw out also portions\r\nfrom the sedimentary formations, and thus the silicified wood comes\r\nfrom the Tertiary or Cretaceous beds, which may have formed the upper\r\npart of the walls of the crater. At any rate, these woods belong to\r\nthe Coal Series of the West, and they are scattered profusely among\r\nthe conglomerates. Interlaced among the massive beds of volcanic\r\nconglomerates are some layers of a light-grey or whitish sandy\r\nclay, which show that the whole breccia or conglomerates, with the\r\nintercalated layers of clay or sand, were deposited in water like any\r\nsedimentary water rocks.\"\r\n\r\nInteresting ruins of ancient springs abound in this valley. Mr. Hayden\r\ndescribes one, a very curious mammiform mound of calcareous deposit,\r\nabout forty feet high, built up by overlapping layers like those of\r\nLiberty Cap on Gardiner's River.\r\n\r\n\"This cone is a complete ruin. No water issues from it at the present\r\ntime, and none of the springs in the vicinity are above the ordinary\r\ntemperature of brook-water; sulphur, alum, and other chemical deposits\r\nare abundant. This old ruin is a fine example of the tendency of the\r\ncone to close up its summit in its dying stages. The top of the cone\r\nis somewhat broken; but it is eighteen feet in diameter at this time,\r\nand near the centre there is a hole or chimney two inches in diameter,\r\nplainly a steam-vent. This marks the closing history of this spring.\r\nThe inner portions of this small chimney are lined with white enamel,\r\nthickly coated with sulphur, which gives it a sulphur-yellow hue. The\r\nbase upon which the cone rests varies in thickness. On the east side\r\nhuge masses have been broken off, exposing a vertical wall twenty feet\r\nhigh, built up of thin horizontal laminæ of limestone. On the west side\r\nthe wall is not quite as high, perhaps eight or ten feet. It would\r\nseem, therefore, that it was at first an overflowing spring, depositing\r\nthin horizontal layers until it built up a broad base ten to twenty\r\nfeet in height; then it gradually became a spouting spring, building\r\nup with overlapping layers like the thatch on a house, until it closed\r\nitself at the top and ceased.\"\r\n\r\nIn the tongue that runs down between the junction of the East Fork and\r\nthe Yellowstone, there is a singular _butte_ cut off from the main\r\nrange, which at once attracts the traveller's attention. The basis or\r\nlower portion of the _butte_ is granite, while the summit is capped\r\nwith the modern basalt, and the _débris_ on the sides and at the base\r\nis remarkable in quantity, and has very much the appearance of an\r\nanthracite coal-heap. This _butte_ will always form a conspicuous\r\nlandmark, not only on account of its position, but also from its\r\npeculiar shape and structure.\r\n\r\nJust below the junction of the East Fork the first and only bridge\r\nacross the Yellowstone was constructed in 1870 for the accommodation\r\nof miners bound for the \"diggings\" on Clark's Fork. It was a work of\r\nconsiderable boldness, as the river is some two hundred feet wide, and\r\nflows with great rapidity over its narrow and rocky channel.\r\n\r\nA short distance above the bridge, on the west side of the Yellowstone,\r\nis a splendid exhibition of black micaceous gneiss, forming a vertical\r\nwall on the right side of a little creek, while on the left the entire\r\nmass of the hills for miles in extent is composed of the usual igneous\r\nrocks. Through these rocks the stream, now not more than four feet wide\r\nand six inches deep, has cut a channel from two hundred to four hundred\r\nyards wide, through the hardest rocks to a depth varying from five\r\nhundred to a thousand feet!\r\n\r\nFurther up the Yellowstone, on the same side, are a number of wonderful\r\nravines and cañons carved in like manner into the very heart of the\r\nmountains. Most conspicuous of these is the Cañon of Tower Greek.\r\nBefore reaching that stream, however, Column Rock, a noticeable\r\nfeature in a landscape of great extent and beauty, demands at least a\r\npassing notice. Column Cliff would be a more appropriate name, since\r\nit extends along the east bank of the river upwards of two miles. Says\r\nMr. Langford, whose observations were made from the west side: \"At\r\nthe distance from which we saw it, we could compare it in appearance\r\nto nothing but a section of the Giant's Causeway. It was composed of\r\nsuccessive pillars of basalt overlying and underlying a thick stratum\r\nof cement and gravel resembling pudding-stone. In both rows, the\r\npillars, standing in close proximity, were each about thirty feet high\r\nand from three to five feet in diameter. This interesting object,\r\nmore from the novelty of its formation and its beautiful surroundings\r\nof mountain and river scenery than anything grand or impressive in\r\nits appearance, excited our attention, until the gathering shades of\r\nevening reminded us of the necessity of selecting a suitable camp.\"\r\n\r\nTower Creek rises in the high divide between the valleys of the\r\nMissouri and the Yellowstone, and flows for about ten miles through\r\na cañon so deep and gloomy that it has earned the appellation,\r\n\"Devil's Den.\" About two hundred yards above its entrance into the\r\nYellowstone, the stream pours over an abrupt descent of one hundred\r\nand fifty-six feet, forming one of the most beautiful falls to be\r\nfound in any country. These falls are about 260 feet above the level\r\nof the Yellowstone at the junction, and are surrounded with columns of\r\nvolcanic breccia, rising fifty feet above the falls and extending down\r\nto the foot, standing like gloomy sentinels, or like gigantic pillars\r\nat the entrance of some grand temple. \"One could almost imagine,\" says\r\nDr. Hayden, \"that the idea of the Gothic style of architecture had been\r\ncaught from such carvings of nature.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the symmetry of some of these columns, Mr. Langford says:\r\n\r\n\"Some resemble towers, others the spires of churches, and others still\r\nshoot up as lithe and slender as the minarets of a mosque. Some of\r\nthe loftiest of these formations, standing like sentinels upon the\r\nvery brink of the fall, are accessible to an expert and adventurous\r\nclimber. The position attained on one of their narrow summits, amid the\r\nuproar of waters and at a height of 250 feet above the boiling chasm,\r\nas the writer can affirm, requires a steady head and strong nerves;\r\nyet the view which rewards the temerity of the exploit is full of\r\ncompensations. Below the fall the stream descends in numerous rapids,\r\nwith frightful velocity, through a gloomy gorge, to its union with the\r\nYellowstone. Its bed is filled with enormous boulders, against which\r\nthe rushing waters break with great fury.\r\n\r\nMany of the capricious formations wrought from the shale excite\r\nmerriment as well as wonder. Of this kind especially was a huge mass\r\nsixty feet in height, which, from its supposed resemblance to the\r\nproverbial foot of his Satanic Majesty, we called the \"Devil's Hoof.\"\r\nThe scenery of mountain, rock, and forest surrounding the falls is very\r\nbeautiful. Here, too, the hunter and fisherman can indulge their tastes\r\nwith the certainty of ample reward. As a half-way resort to the greater\r\nwonders still farther up the marvellous river, the visitor of future\r\nyears will find no more delightful resting-place. The name of \"Tower\r\nFalls,\" which we gave it, was suggested by some of the most conspicuous\r\nfeatures of the scenery.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEVIL'S HOOF.]\r\n\r\nThe sides of the chasm are worn into caverns lined with\r\nvariously-tinted mosses, nourished by clouds of spray which rise\r\nfrom the cataract; while above, and to the left, a spur from the\r\ngreat plateau rises over all, with a perpendicular front of 400 feet.\r\nThe fall is accessible both at the brink and at the foot, and fine\r\nviews can be obtained from either side of the cañon. In appearance\r\nit strongly resembles Minnehaha, but is several times as high, and\r\nthe volume of water is at least eight times as great. In the basin a\r\nlarge petrified log was found imbedded in the débris. \"Nothing,\" says\r\nLieutenant Doane, \"can be more chastely beautiful than this lovely\r\ncascade, hidden away in the dim light of overshadowing rocks and woods,\r\nits very voice hushed to a low murmur, unheard at the distance of a few\r\nhundred yards. Thousands might pass by within a half mile and not dream\r\nof its existence; but once seen, it passes to the list of most pleasant\r\nmemories.\"\r\n\r\nAlong the Yellowstone, near the mouth of Tower Creek, is a system\r\nof small mineral springs distributed for a distance of two miles in\r\nthe bottom of the deep cañon through which the river runs. Several\r\nof these springs have a temperature at the boiling point; many are\r\nhighly sulphurous, holding, in fact, more sulphur than they can carry\r\nin solution, and depositing it in yellowish beds along their courses.\r\nSeveral of them are impregnated with iron, alum, and other substances.\r\nTheir sulphurous fumes can be detected at the distance of half a mile.\r\nThe excess of sulphur in the rock-walls of the cañon give a brilliant\r\nyellow color to the rocks in many places. The formation is usually very\r\nfriable, falling with a natural slope to the edge of the stream, but\r\noccasionally masses of a more solid nature project from the wall in\r\ncurious shapes of towers, minarets, and the like; while over all the\r\nsolid ledge of trap, with its dark and well-defined columns, makes a\r\nrich and beautiful border inclosing the pictured rocks below.\r\n\r\nThis is the mouth of the Grand Cañon of the Yellowstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nOVER MOUNT WASHBURN TO THE FALLS OF THE YELLOWSTONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Upper or Grand Cañon of the Yellowstone extends from the mouth\r\nof Tower Creek to the foot of the Great Fall, a distance of twenty\r\nmiles. It is impassable throughout its entire length, and accessible\r\nto the water's edge only at few points and by dint of severe labor.\r\nThe trail ascends the divide between Tower Creek and the Yellowstone,\r\nskirting for six or eight miles the cañon of Tower Creek. The ground\r\nrises rapidly and is much broken by creek-beds running parallel with\r\nthe river. Following the highest ridges, the first explorers reached\r\nat last a point whence they could overlook the Grand Cañon cleaving\r\nthe slopes and breaking through the lofty mountain ranges in front.\r\nHere they caught their first glimpse of a phenomenon afterwards to\r\nbecome a familiar sight to them. Through the mountain gap formed by the\r\ncañon, and on the interior slopes some twenty miles distant, an object\r\nappeared which drew a simultaneous expression of wonder from every one\r\nin the party. It was a column of steam, rising from the dense woods to\r\nthe height of several hundred feet. They had all heard fabulous stories\r\nof this region, and were somewhat skeptical of appearances. At first it\r\nwas pronounced a fire in the woods, but presently some one noticed that\r\nthe vapor rose in regular puffs, as if expelled with a great force.\r\nThen conviction was forced upon them. It was, indeed, a great column of\r\nsteam, puffing away on the lofty mountain side, with a roaring sound,\r\naudible at a long distance, even through the heavy forest. A hearty\r\ncheer rang out at this discovery, and they pressed onward with renewed\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe highest peak of this ridge was named by the first company who\r\nclimbed it--Mount Washburn--in honor of their leader. The view from\r\nits summit is \"grand beyond description;\" yet some conception of its\r\ngrandeur can be formed, let us hope, from the graphic review of its\r\nmore striking features by Lieutenant Doane.\r\n\r\n\"Looking northward, the great plateau stretches away from the base\r\nof the mountain to the front and left with its innumerable groves\r\nand sparkling waters, a variegated landscape of surpassing beauty,\r\nbounded on its extreme verge by the cañons of the Yellowstone. The pure\r\natmosphere of this lofty region causes every outline of tree, rock, or\r\nlakelet to be visible with wonderful distinctness, and objects twenty\r\nmiles away appear as if very near at hand. Still further to the left\r\nthe snowy ranges on the headwaters of Gardiner's River stretch away to\r\nthe westward, joining those on the head of the Gallatin, and forming,\r\nwith the Elephant's Back, a continuous chain, bending constantly to\r\nthe south, the rim of the Yellowstone Basin. On the verge of the\r\nhorizon appear, like mole-hills in the distance, and far below, the\r\nwhite summits above the Gallatin Valley. These never thaw during the\r\nsummer months, though several thousand feet lower than where we now\r\nstand upon the bare granite, and no snow visible near, save in the\r\ndepths of shaded ravines. Beyond the plateau to the right front is the\r\ndeep valley of the East Fork bearing away eastward, and still beyond,\r\nragged volcanic peaks, heaped in inextricable confusion, as far as the\r\nlimit of vision extends. On the east, close beneath our feet, yawns\r\nthe immense gulf of the Grand Cañon, cutting away the bases of two\r\nmountains in forcing a passage through the range. Its yellow walls\r\ndivide the landscape nearly in a straight line to the junction of Warm\r\nSpring (Tower) Creek below. The ragged edges of the chasm are from two\r\nhundred to five hundred yards apart, its depth so profound that the\r\nriver bed is nowhere visible. No sound reaches the ear from the bottom\r\nof the abyss; the sun's rays are reflected on the farther wall and then\r\nlost in the darkness below. The mind struggles and then falls back upon\r\nitself, despairing in the efforts to grasp by a single thought the idea\r\nof its immensity. Beyond, a gentle declivity, sloping from the summit\r\nof the broken range, extends to the limit of vision, a wilderness of\r\nunbroken pine forest.\r\n\r\n\"Turning southward, a new and strange scene bursts upon the view.\r\nFilling the whole field of vision, and with its boundaries in\r\nthe verge of the horizon, lies the great volcanic basin of the\r\nYellowstone--nearly circular in form, from fifty to seventy-five\r\nmiles in diameter; and with a general depression of about 2,000 feet\r\nbelow the summits of the great ranges which form its outer rim. Mount\r\nWashburn lies in the point of the circumference, northeast from the\r\ncentre of the basin; far away in the southwest, the three great Tetons\r\non Snake River fill another space in the circle; connecting these two\r\nhighest are crescent ranges, one westward and south, past Gardiner's\r\nRiver and the Gallatin, bounding the lower Madison, thence to the\r\nJefferson and by the Snake River range to the Tetons; another eastward\r\nand south, a continuous range by the head of Rose Bud, inclosing the\r\nsources of the Snake, and joining the Tetons beyond. Between the south\r\nand west points, this vast circle is broken through in many places\r\nfor the passage of the rivers; but a single glance at the interior\r\nslopes of the ranges shows that a former complete connection existed,\r\nand that the great basin has been one vast crater of a now extinct\r\nvolcano. The nature of the rocks, the steepness and outline of the\r\ninterior walls, together with other peculiarities to be mentioned\r\nhereafter, render this conclusion a certainty. The lowest point in\r\nthis great amphitheatre lies directly in front of us, and about eight\r\nmiles distant: a grassy valley, branching between low ridges, running\r\nfrom the river toward the centre of the basin. A small stream rises in\r\nthis valley, breaking through the ridges to the west in a deep cañon,\r\nand falling into the channel of the Yellowstone, which here bears in a\r\nnortheast course, flowing in view as far as the confluence of the small\r\nstream, thence plunged into the Grand Cañon, and hidden from sight. No\r\nfalls can be seen, but their location is readily detected by the sudden\r\ndisappearance of the river; beyond this open valley the basin appears\r\nto be filled with a succession of low, converging ridges, heavily\r\ntimbered, and all of about an equal altitude.\r\n\r\n\"To the south appears a broad sheet of water--the Yellowstone Lake.\r\nAcross the Grand Cañon, on the slope of the great mountain wall, is the\r\nsteam jet seen this morning; and in the next ravine beyond it are six\r\nmore of inferior volume. Still farther south are others, to the number\r\nof perhaps twenty, and to the southwest more of them, scattered over\r\nthe vast expanse of the basin, rising from behind the wooded hills in\r\nevery direction. The view in this respect strongly resembles that from\r\nthe Alleghanies, where they overlook iron and coal districts, with all\r\ntheir furnaces in active operation, save that one looks in vain here\r\nfor the thrifty towns, country villas, steamboats, and railroad depots.\"\r\n\r\nDoes this picture seem overdrawn? The briefer and less enthusiastic\r\ndescription of Dr. Hayden confirms its truth, though he does not accept\r\nin full Lieutenant Doane's interpretation of it. He says, in his\r\nofficial report:\r\n\r\n\"The view from the summit of Mount Washburn is one of the finest I have\r\never seen, and although the atmosphere was somewhat obscured by smoke,\r\nyet an area of fifty to one hundred miles radius in every direction\r\ncould be seen more or less distinctly. We caught the first glimpse\r\nof the great basin of the Yellowstone, with the lake, which reminded\r\none much, from its bays, indentations, and surrounding mountains, of\r\nGreat Salt Lake. To the south are the Tetons, rising high above all the\r\nrest, the monarchs of all they survey, with their summits covered with\r\nperpetual snow. To the southwest an immense area of dense pine forests\r\nextends for one hundred miles without a peak rising above the black,\r\nlevel mass. A little farther to the southwest and west are the Madison\r\nMountains, a lofty, grand, snow-capped range, extending far to the\r\nnorthward. Nearer and in full view, to the west commence the bold peaks\r\nof the Gallatin Range, extending northward as far as the eye can reach.\r\nTo the north we get a full view of the valley of the Yellowstone, with\r\nthe lofty ranges that wall it in. Emigrant Peak, and the splendid group\r\nof mountains of which it is a part, can be clearly seen, and lose none\r\nof their marvellous beauty of outline, view them from what point we\r\nmay. To the north and east the eye scans the most remarkable chaotic\r\nmass of peaks of the most rugged character, apparently without system,\r\nyet sending their jagged summits high up among the clouds. Farther\r\ndistant are somewhat more regular ranges, snow-covered, probably the\r\nBig Horn. But with all this magnificent scenery around us from every\r\nside, the greatest beauty was the lake, in full view to the southeast,\r\nset like a gem amid the high mountains, which are literally bristling\r\nwith peaks, many of them capped with snow. These are all of volcanic\r\norigin, and the fantastic shapes which many of them have assumed under\r\nthe hand of time, called forth a variety of names from my party. There\r\nwere two of them that represented the human profile so well that we\r\ncalled them the \"Giant's Face \"and \"Old Man of the Mountain.\" These\r\nformed good landmarks for the topographer, for they were visible from\r\nevery point of the basin.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the geological character of the country seen from Mount\r\nWashburn, Dr. Hayden observes, in discussing the geology of the region:\r\n\r\n\"We may say, in brief, that the entire basin of the Yellowstone is\r\nvolcanic. I am not prepared to pronounce it a crater, with a lake\r\noccupying the inner portion, while the mountains that surround the\r\nbasin are the ruins of this great crater; but, at a period not very\r\nremote in the geological past, this whole country was a scene of\r\nwonderful volcanic activity. I regard the hot springs so abundant all\r\nover the valley as the last stages of this grand scene. Hot springs,\r\ngeysers, etc., are so intimately connected with what we usually term\r\nvolcanoes that their origin and action admit of the same explanation.\r\nBoth undoubtedly form safety-valves or vents for the escape of the\r\npowerful forces that have been generated in the interior of the earth\r\nsince the commencement of our present period; the true volcanic action\r\nhas ceased, but the safety-valves are the thousands of hot springs all\r\nover this great area. I believe that the time of the greatest volcanic\r\nactivity occurred during the Pliocene period--smoke, ashes, fragments\r\nof rock, and lava poured forth from thousands of orifices into the\r\nsurrounding waters. Hundreds of cones were built up, fragments of which\r\nstill remain; and around them were arranged by the water the dust and\r\nfragments of rock, the _ejectamenta_ of these volcanoes, in the form of\r\nthe conglomerate or breccia as we find it now. These orifices may have\r\nbeen of every possible form--rounded or oblong, mere fissures, perhaps,\r\nextending for miles, and building up their own crater rims as the hot\r\nsprings build up their rounded, conical peaks or oblong mounds at the\r\npresent time.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving Mount Washburn, with its summit piles of basalt, and its\r\nprecipitous slope scattered with agates and beautiful fragments of\r\nsardonyx, chalcedony, and malachite, let us descend to the valley.\r\n\r\nThe trail pursues a tortuous way to avoid the fallen timber and the\r\ndense groves of pine, descending the almost vertical inner sides of the\r\nrim of the Yellowstone Basin, to the valley of a small creek. Two or\r\nthree miles down this stream is a hideous glen, filled with sulphurous\r\nvapor emitted from six or eight boiling springs of great size and\r\nactivity. Mr. Langford says of this unsavory place:\r\n\r\n\"It looked like nothing earthly we had ever seen, and the pungent fumes\r\nwhich filled the atmosphere were not unaccompanied by a disagreeable\r\nsense of possible suffocation. Entering the basin cautiously, we found\r\nthe entire surface of the earth covered with the incrusted sinter\r\nthrown from the springs. Jets of hot vapor were expelled through\r\na hundred natural orifices with which it was pierced, and through\r\nevery fracture made by passing over it. The springs themselves were\r\nas diabolical in appearance as the witches' caldron in Macbeth, and\r\nneeded but the presence of Hecate and her weird band to realize that\r\nhorrible creation of poetic fancy. They were all in a state of violent\r\nebullition, throwing their liquid contents to the height of three or\r\nfour feet. The largest had a basin twenty by forty feet in diameter.\r\nIts greenish-yellow water was covered with bubbles, which were\r\nconstantly rising, bursting, and emitting sulphurous gas from various\r\nparts of its surface. The central spring seethed and bubbled like a\r\nboiling caldron. Fearful volumes of vapor were constantly escaping it.\r\nNear it was another, not so large, but more infernal in appearance.\r\nIts contents, of the consistency of paint, were in constant, noisy\r\nebullition. A stick thrust into it, on being withdrawn, was coated\r\nwith lead-colored slime a quarter of an inch in thickness. Nothing\r\nflows from this spring. Seemingly, it is boiling down. A fourth spring,\r\nwhich exhibited the same physical features, was partly covered by an\r\noverhanging ledge of rock. We tried to fathom it, but the bottom was\r\nbeyond the reach of the longest pole we could find. Rocks cast into it\r\nincreased the agitation of its waters. There were several other springs\r\nin the group, smaller in size, but presenting the same characteristics.\r\n\r\n\"The approach to them was unsafe, the incrustation surrounding them\r\nbending in many places beneath our weight,--and from the fractures thus\r\ncreated would ooze a sulphury slime of the consistency of mucilage.\r\nIt was with great difficulty that we obtained specimens from the\r\nnatural apertures with which the crust is filled,--a feat which was\r\naccomplished by one only of our party, who extended himself at full\r\nlength upon that portion of the incrustation which yielded the least,\r\nbut which was not sufficiently strong to bear his weight while in an\r\nupright position, and at imminent risk of sinking into the infernal\r\nmixture, rolled over and over to the edge of the opening, and with the\r\ncrust slowly bending and sinking beneath him, hurriedly secured the\r\ncoveted prize.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GETTING A SPECIMEN.]\r\n\r\n\"There was something so revolting in the general appearance of the\r\nsprings and their surroundings--the foulness of the vapors, the\r\ninfernal contents, the treacherous incrustation, the noisy ebullition,\r\nthe general appearance of desolation, and the seclusion and wildness\r\nof the location--that, though awestruck, we were not unreluctant to\r\ncontinue our journey without making them a second visit.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more our amateur explorers had recourse to their western\r\nvocabulary, and bestowed on this unhappy locality the title,\r\n\"Hell-broth Springs\"--which, says the historian of the expedition,\r\n\"fully expressed our appreciation of their character.\"\r\n\r\nThe following season this remarkable group of springs was thoroughly\r\nexamined by the party under Dr. Hayden. That careful observer says:\r\n\r\n\"They are evidently diminishing in power, but the rims all around\r\nreveal the most powerful manifestations far back in the past. Sulphur,\r\ncopper, alum, and soda cover the surface. There is also precipitated\r\naround the borders of some of the mud springs a white efflorescence,\r\nprobably nitrate of potash. These springs are located on the side of\r\nthe mountain, nearly 1,000 feet above the margin of the cañon, but\r\nextend along into the level portions below.... One of these springs was\r\nbubbling quite briskly, but had a temperature of only 100°. Near it is\r\na turbid spring of 170°. In the valley are a large number of turbid,\r\nmud, and boiling springs, with temperatures from 175° to 185°. There\r\nare a number of springs that issue from the side of the mountain, and\r\nthe waters, gathering into one channel, flow into the Yellowstone, The\r\nnumber of frying or simmering springs is great. The ground in many\r\nplaces, for several yards in every direction, is perforated like a\r\nsieve, and the water bubbles by with a simmering noise. There is one\r\nhuge boiling spring which deposits fine black mud all around the sides.\r\nThe depth of the crater of this spring, its dark, gloomy appearance,\r\nand the tremendous force which it manifested in its operations, led\r\nus to name it the \"Devil's Caldron.\" There are a large number of\r\nsprings here, but no true geysers. It is plainly the last stages of\r\nwhat was once a most remarkable group. Extending across the cañon on\r\nthe opposite side of the Yellowstone, interrupted here and there, this\r\ngroup of springs extends for several miles, forming one of the largest\r\ndeposits of silica, but only here and there are there signs of life.\r\nMany of the dead springs are mere basins, with a thick deposit of iron\r\non the sides, lining the channel of the water that flows from them.\r\nThese vary in temperature from 98° to 120°. The highest temperature\r\nwas 192°. The steam-vents are very numerous, and the chimneys are\r\nlined with sulphur. Where the crust can be removed, we find the under\r\nside lined with the most delicate crystals of sulphur, which disappear\r\nlike frost-work at the touch. Still there is a considerable amount of\r\nsolid amorphous sulphur. The sulphur and the iron, with the vegetable\r\nmatter which is always very abundant about the springs, give, through\r\nthe almost infinite variety of shades, a most pleasing and striking\r\npicture. One of the mud springs, with a basin twenty by twenty-five\r\nfeet, and six feet deep, is covered with large bubbles or puffs\r\nconstantly bursting with a thud. There are a number of high hills in\r\nthis vicinity entirely composed of the hot-spring deposits, at least\r\nnine-tenths silica, appearing snowy-white in the distance; one of\r\nthe walls is 175 feet high, and another about 70 feet. They are now\r\ncovered to a greater or less extent with pines. Steam is constantly\r\nissuing from vents around the base and from the sides of these hills.\r\nThere is one lake 100 by 300 yards, with a number of bubbling and\r\nboiling springs rising to the surface. Near the shore is one of the\r\nsieve-springs, with a great number of small perforations, from which\r\nthe water bubbles up with a simmering noise; temperature, 188°. This\r\ngroup really forms one of the great ruins.\"\r\n\r\nA short day's march from Hell-broth Spring brings the traveller to a\r\nlittle stream flowing into the Yellowstone, between the upper and the\r\nlower fall. From its rapid and tumultuous flow, the first explorers\r\ncalled it Cascade Creek. Just before its union with the Yellowstone it\r\ntraverses a gloomy gorge cut through a kind of volcanic sandstone,\r\nlargely made up of fragments of obsidian and other igneous rocks\r\ncemented with volcanic ash. This rock is worn by the water into so many\r\nfantastic shapes and cavernous recesses, that--with their usual poverty\r\nof invention and tartarean taste--the first observers straightway gave\r\nthe uncanny channel over to the Prince of Darkness, and dubbed it the\r\nDevil's Den. A mile below this gorge the stream flows over a series\r\nof ledges, making a cascade as beautiful as its previous course has\r\nbeen weird and ugly. There is first a fall of five feet, which is\r\nimmediately succeeded by another of fifteen, into a pool as clear as\r\namber, nestled beneath overarching rocks. Here the stream lingers as if\r\nhalf reluctant to continue its course, then gracefully emerges from the\r\ngrotto, and, veiling the rocks down an abrupt descent of eighty-four\r\nfeet, passes rapidly on to the Yellowstone. For a wonder, this charming\r\nfall has received a corresponding name--Crystal Cascade. An infinite\r\nvariety of volcanic specimens, quartz, feldspar, mica, granites, lavas,\r\nbasalts, composite crystals--in fact, everything, from asbestos to\r\nobsidian, is represented by fragments in the bed of this stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEVIL'S DEN.]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the gorge and on the margin of the Yellowstone stands a\r\nhigh promontory of concretionary lava, literally filled with volcanic\r\nbutternuts. Many of these are loose, and can be taken out of the rock\r\nwith the hand; broken open, they are invariably hollow, and lined with\r\nminute quartz crystals of various tints. This rare formation occurs\r\nfrequently in the great basin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND CAÑON AND THE FALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo language,\" says Dr. Hayden, \"can do justice to the wonderful\r\ngrandeur and beauty of the Grand Cañon.\" It has no parallel in the\r\nworld. Through the eye alone can any just idea be gained of its\r\nstrange, awful, fascinating, unearthly blending of the majestic and\r\nthe beautiful; and, even in its visible presence, the mind fails to\r\ncomprehend the weird and unfamiliar, almost incredible scenes it\r\nreveals. Says Mr. Langford: \"The brain reels as we gaze into this\r\nprofound and solemn solitude. We shrink from the dizzy verge appalled,\r\nglad to feel the solid earth under our feet, and venture no more,\r\nexcept with forms extended, and faces barely protruding over the edge\r\nof the precipice. The stillness is horrible. Down, down, down, we see\r\nthe river attenuated to a thread, tossing its miniature waves, and\r\ndashing, with puny strength, against the massive walls which imprison\r\nit. All access to its margin is denied, and the dark gray rocks hold\r\nit in dismal shadow. Even the voice of its waters in their convulsive\r\nagony cannot be heard. Uncheered by plant or shrub, obstructed with\r\nmassive boulders and by jutting points, it rushes madly on its solitary\r\ncourse. The solemn grandeur of the scene surpasses description. The\r\nsense of danger with which it impresses you is harrowing in the\r\nextreme. You feel the absence of sound, the oppression of absolute\r\nsilence. If you could only hear that gurgling river, if you could see a\r\nliving tree in the depth beneath you, if a bird would fly past, if the\r\nwind would move any object in the awful chasm, to break for a moment\r\nthe solemn silence that reigns there, it would relieve that tension of\r\nthe nerves which the scene has excited, and you would rise from your\r\nprostrate condition and thank God that he had permitted you to gaze,\r\nunharmed, upon this majestic display of natural architecture. As it\r\nis, sympathizing in spirit with the deep gloom of the scene, you crawl\r\nfrom the dreadful verge, scared lest the firm rock give way beneath and\r\nprecipitate you into the horrid gulf.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fearful descent into this terrific cañon,\" Mr. Langford adds, \"was\r\naccomplished with great difficulty by Messrs. Hauser and Stickney, at\r\na point about two miles below the falls. By trigonometrical measurement\r\nthey found the chasm at that point to be 1,190 feet deep. Their\r\nascent from it was perilous, and it was only by making good use of\r\nhands and feet, and keeping the nerves braced to the utmost tension,\r\nthat they were enabled to clamber up the precipitous rocks to a safe\r\nlanding-place.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Doane also made the descent, somewhat further down the\r\nriver, accompanied by one of his company. Selecting the channel of\r\na small creek, they scrambled down its steep descent, wading in the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n\"On entering the ravine, we came at once to hot springs of sulphur,\r\nsulphate of copper, alum, steam jets, etc., in endless variety, some\r\nof them of very peculiar form. One of them in particular, of sulphur,\r\nhad built up a tall spire, standing out from the slope of the wall\r\nlike an enormous horn, with hot water trickling down its sides. The\r\ncreek ran on a bed of solid rock, in many places smooth and slippery,\r\nin others obstructed by masses of débris from the overhanging cliffs\r\nof the sulphureted limestone above. After descending for three miles\r\nin the channel we came to a sort of bench or terrace, the same one\r\nseen previously in following down the creek from our first camp in\r\nthe basin. Here we found a large flock of mountain sheep, very tame,\r\nand greatly astonished, no doubt, at our sudden appearance. McConnell\r\nkilled one and wounded another, whereupon the rest disappeared,\r\nclambering up the steep walls with a celerity truly astonishing. We\r\nwere now 1,500 feet below the brink. From here the creek channel was\r\nmore precipitous, and for a mile we made our way down over masses of\r\nrock and fallen trees, splashing in warm water, ducking under cascades,\r\nand skirting close against sidelong places to keep from falling into\r\nboiling caldrons in the channel. After four hours of hard labor we\r\nreached the bottom of the gulf and the margin of the Yellowstone,\r\nfamished with thirst, wet and exhausted. The river-water here is quite\r\nwarm, and of a villainously alum and sulphurous taste. Its margin is\r\nlined with all kinds of chemical springs, some depositing craters of\r\ncalcareous rock, others muddy, black, blue, slaty, or reddish water.\r\nThe internal heat renders the atmosphere oppressive, though a strong\r\nbreeze draws through the cañon. A frying sound comes constantly to\r\nthe ear, mingled with the rush of the current. The place abounds with\r\nsickening and purgatorial smells. We had come down the ravine at least\r\nfour miles, and looking upward the fearful wall appeared to reach the\r\nsky. It was about three o'clock P.M., and stars could be distinctly\r\nseen, so much of the sunlight was cut off from entering the chasm. Tall\r\npines on the extreme verge appeared the height of two or three feet.\r\nThe cañon, as before said, was in two benches, with a plateau on either\r\nside, about half way down. This plateau, about a hundred yards in\r\nwidth, looked from below like a mere shelf against the wall; the total\r\ndepth was not less than 2,500 feet, and more probably 3,000. There are\r\nperhaps other cañons longer and deeper than this one, but surely none\r\ncombining grandeur and immensity with such peculiarity of formation and\r\nprofusion of volcanic or chemical phenomena.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of this tremendous chasm is not hard to read. Ages ago this\r\nwhole region was the basin of an immense lake. Then it became a centre\r\nof volcanic activity; vast quantities of lava was erupted, which,\r\ncooling under water, took the form of basalt; volumes of volcanic\r\nash and rock-fragments were thrown out from the craters from time to\r\ntime, forming breccia as it sunk through the water and mingled with\r\nthe deposits from silicious springs. Over this were spread the later\r\ndeposits from the waters of the old lake. In time the country was\r\nslowly elevated, and the lake was drained away. The easily eroded\r\nbreccia along the river channel was cut out deeper and deeper as the\r\nages passed, while springs and creeks and the falling rain combined to\r\ncarve the sides of the cañon into the fantastic forms they now present,\r\nby wearing away the softer rock, and leaving the hard basalt and the\r\nfirmer hot-spring deposits standing in massive columns and Gothic\r\npinnacles. The basis material of the old hot spring deposits in silica,\r\noriginally white as snow, are now stained by mineral waters with every\r\nshade of red and yellow--from scarlet to rose color, from bright\r\nsulphur to the daintiest tint of cream. When the light falls favorably\r\non these blended tints the Grand Cañon presents a more enchanting\r\nand bewildering variety of forms and colors than human artist ever\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\nThe erosion was practically arrested at the upper end of the cañon by a\r\nsudden transition from the softer breccia to hard basalt, and the falls\r\nare the result. From below the Upper Fall the vertical wall of basalt\r\ncan be clearly seen passing diagonally across the rim. The Lower Fall\r\nwas formed in the same way.\r\n\r\n\"A grander scene than the lower cataract of the Yellowstone,\" writes\r\nMr. Langford, \"was never witnessed by mortal eyes. The volume seemed\r\nto be adapted to all the harmonies of the surrounding scenery. Had\r\nit been greater or smaller it would have been less impressive. The\r\nriver, from a width of two hundred feet above the fall, is compressed\r\nby converging rocks to one hundred and fifty feet, where it takes the\r\nplunge. The shelf over which it falls is as level and even as a work of\r\nart. The height, by actual line measurement, is a few inches more than\r\n350 feet. It is a sheer, compact, solid, perpendicular sheet, faultless\r\nin all the elements of grandeur and picturesque beauties. The cañon\r\nwhich commences at the upper fall, half a mile above this cataract,\r\nis here a thousand feet in depth. Its vertical sides rise grey and\r\ndark above the fall to shelving summits, from which one can look down\r\ninto the boiling, spray-filled chasm, enlivened with rainbows, and\r\nglittering like a shower of diamonds. From a shelf protruding over the\r\nstream, 500 feet below the top of the cañon, and 180 above the verge\r\nof the cataract, a member of our company, lying prone upon the rock,\r\nlet down a cord, with a stone attached, into the gulf, and measured\r\nits profoundest depths. The life and sound of the cataract, with its\r\nsparkling spray and fleecy foam, contrasts strangely with the sombre\r\nstillness of the cañon a mile below. There all was darkness, gloom, and\r\nshadow; here all was vivacity, gayety, and delight. One was the most\r\nunsocial, the other the most social scene in nature. We could talk,\r\nand sing, and whoop, waking the echoes with our mirth and laughter in\r\npresence of the falls, but we could not thus profane the silence of the\r\ncañon. Seen through the cañon below the falls, the river for a mile or\r\nmore is broken by rapids and cascades of great variety and beauty.\r\n\r\n\"Between the Lower and Upper Falls the cañon is two hundred to nearly\r\nfour hundred feet deep. The river runs over a level bed of rock, and\r\nis undisturbed by rapids until near the verge of the lower fall. The\r\nupper fall is entirely unlike the other, but in its peculiar character\r\nequally interesting. For some distance above it the river breaks into\r\nfrightful rapids. The stream is narrowed between the rocks as it\r\napproaches the brink, and bounds with impatient struggles for release,\r\nleaping through the stony jaws, in a sheet of snow-white foam, over a\r\nprecipice nearly perpendicular, 115 feet high.[1] Midway in its descent\r\nthe entire volume of water is carried, by the sloping surface of an\r\nintervening ledge, twelve or fifteen feet beyond the vertical base\r\nof the precipice, gaining therefrom a novel and interesting feature.\r\nThe churning of the water upon the rocks reduces it to a mass of\r\nfoam and spray, through which all the colors of the solar spectrum\r\nare reproduced in astonishing profusion. What this cataract lacks in\r\nsublimity is more than compensated by picturesqueness. The rocks which\r\novershadow it do not veil it from the open light. It is up amid the\r\npine foliage which crowns the adjacent hills, the grand feature of a\r\nlandscape unrivalled for beauties of vegetation as well as of rock and\r\nglen. The two confronting rocks, overhanging the verge at the height of\r\na hundred feet or more, could be readily united by a bridge, from which\r\nsome of the grandest views of natural scenery in the world could be\r\nobtained--while just in front of, and within reaching distance of the\r\narrowy water, from a table one-third of the way below the brink of the\r\nfall, all its nearest beauties and terrors may be caught at a glance.\"\r\n\r\n\"We rambled around the falls and cañon two days, and left them with the\r\nunpleasant conviction that the greatest wonder of our journey had been\r\nseen.\"\r\n\r\nA few scattered sentences, culled from Dr. Hayden's calmly scientific\r\naccount of the falls, will suffice to show that Mr. Langford's\r\ndescription \"o'ersteps not the modesty of nature.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UPPER FALLS OF THE YELLOWSTONE.]\r\n\r\n\"Above the Upper Falls the Yellowstone flows through a grassy,\r\nmeadow-like valley, with a calm, steady current, giving no warning,\r\nuntil very near the falls, that it is about to rush over a precipice\r\n140 feet, and then, within a quarter of a mile, again to leap down a\r\ndistance of 350 feet.\r\n\r\n\"From any point of view the Upper Falls are extremely picturesque and\r\nstriking. The entire volume of water seems to be, as it were, hurled\r\noff of the precipice with the force which it has accumulated in the\r\nrapids above, so that the mass is detached into the most beautiful\r\nsnow-white, bead-like drops, and as it strikes the rocky basin below,\r\nit shoots through the water with a sort of ricochet for the distance of\r\n200 feet. The whole presents in the distance the appearance of a mass\r\nof snow-white foam. On the sides of the basalt walls there is a thick\r\ngrowth of vegetation, nourished by the spray above, which extends up as\r\nfar as the moisture can reach.... After the waters roll over the upper\r\ndescent, they flow with great rapidity over the apparently flat rocky\r\nbottom, which spreads out to nearly double its width above the falls,\r\nand continues thus until near the Lower Falls, when the channel again\r\ncontracts, and the waters seem, as it were, to gather themselves into\r\none compact mass and plunge over the descent of 350 feet in detached\r\ndrops of foam as white as snow; some of the large globules of water\r\nshoot down like the contents of an exploded rocket.... The entire mass\r\nof the water falls into a circular basin, which has been worn into the\r\nhard rock, so that the rebound is one of the magnificent features of\r\nthe scene.... It is a sight far more beautiful, though not so grand or\r\nimpressive as that of Niagara Falls. A heavy mist always rises from\r\nthe water at the foot of the falls, so dense that one cannot approach\r\nwithin 200 or 300 feet, and even then the clothes will be drenched in\r\na few moments. Upon the yellow, nearly vertical wall of the west side,\r\nthe mist mostly falls, and for 300 feet from the bottom the wall is\r\ncovered with a thick matting of mosses, sedges, grasses, and other\r\nvegetation of the most vivid green, which have sent their small roots\r\ninto the softened rocks, and are nourished by the ever-ascending spray.\r\nAt the base and quite high up on the sides of the cañon, are great\r\nquantities of talus, and through the fragments of rocks and decomposed\r\nspring deposits may be seen the horizontal strata of breccia.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return down the opposite or eastern side of the river, Colonel\r\nBarlow descended to the foot of the Lower Fall for the purpose of\r\nexploring the cañon. He says: \"I expected this to be an undertaking of\r\ngreat difficulty and attended with some danger, but entering a sharp\r\nand narrow gorge or fissure in the side of the cañon, immediately below\r\nthe great fall, I found the descent much easier than was anticipated.\r\nIt proved to be very steep, but the rock being solid, with projecting\r\nangles, there was little danger to a careful climber. A slope of\r\nloose and finely broken rock, a hundred feet in height, moist from\r\nthe falling spray, terminated the descent. Sliding to the bottom of\r\nthis slope, I stood at the foot of the great fall, 350 feet below its\r\ncrest, the walls of the cañon rising 700 feet. My first impression\r\non beholding this fall from below was one of disappointment; it did\r\nnot appear as high as I expected. The fall, however, was grand, and\r\npresented a symmetrical and unbroken sheet of white foam, set in dark\r\nmasses of rock, while rainbows were formed in the spray from almost\r\nevery point of view. The steep rocks near the falls, constantly wet\r\nwith rising mist, were covered with vegetation of an intensely green\r\ncolor. The river below runs with the velocity of a torrent, rushing\r\ndown declivities, spinning round sharp angles, and dashing itself into\r\nspray at every turn. I found it impossible to follow the bed of the\r\nstream, the steep and slippery side affording no footing whatever, and\r\ncrumbling at the slightest touch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nFROM THE FALLS TO THE LAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf a mile above the Upper Fall the Yellowstone gives no intimation of\r\nits approaching career of wildness and grandeur. It rolls peacefully\r\nbetween low verdant banks and over pebbly reaches or spaces of\r\nquicksand, with beautiful curves and a majestic motion. Its waters\r\nare clear and cold, and of the emerald hue characteristic of Niagara.\r\nGreat numbers of small springs, fed by the slowly melting snows of\r\nthe mountains, flow from the densely wooded foot-hills, irrigating\r\nthe \"bottoms,\" and sustaining a growth of grass and flowers that\r\nclothes the lowlands with freshness and vividness of color. Everything\r\nterrific, diabolic, volcanic, would seem to have been left behind.\r\nThe first hint to the contrary is given by a pretty little rivulet,\r\na yard wide and a few inches deep, clear as crystal, winding along\r\nthrough the rank grass to join the Yellowstone. It looks like any\r\nclear-watered mountain stream; but a single taste shows that it has\r\na different origin. It is strongly charged with alum--hence its name,\r\nAlum Creek--and its source is in a remarkable group of sulphur and alum\r\nsprings two or three miles further on,--that is, about ten miles above\r\nthe falls.\r\n\r\nAll about these springs are evidences of volcanic action in great\r\nvariety and profusion. Mr. Langford says:\r\n\r\n\"The region was filled with boiling springs and craters. Two hills,\r\neach 300 feet high, and from a quarter to half a mile across, had\r\nbeen formed wholly of the sinter thrown from adjacent springs--lava,\r\nsulphur, and reddish-brown clay. Hot streams of vapor were pouring\r\nfrom crevices scattered over them. Their surfaces answered in hollow\r\nintonations to every footstep, and in several places yielded to\r\nthe weight of our horses. Steaming vapor rushed hissingly from the\r\nfractures, and all around the natural vents large quantities of sulphur\r\nin crystallized form, perfectly pure, had been deposited. This could be\r\nreadily gathered with pick and shovel. A great many exhausted craters\r\ndotted the hill-side. One near the summit, still alive, changed its\r\nhues like steel under the process of tempering, to every kiss of the\r\npassing breeze. The hottest vapors were active beneath the incrusted\r\nsurface everywhere. A thick leathern glove was no protection to the\r\nhand exposed to them. Around these immense thermal deposits, the\r\ncountry, for a great distance in all directions, is filled with boiling\r\nsprings, all exhibiting separate characteristics.\r\n\r\n\"The most conspicuous of the cluster is a sulphur spring twelve\r\nby twenty feet in diameter, encircled by a beautifully scolloped\r\nsedimentary border, in which the water is thrown to a height of from\r\nthree to seven feet. The regular formation of this border, and the\r\nperfect shading of the scollops forming it, are among the most delicate\r\nand wonderful freaks of nature's handiwork. They look like an elaborate\r\nwork of art. This spring is located at the western base of Crater Hill,\r\nabove described, and the gentle slope around it for a distance of 300\r\nfeet is covered to considerable depth with a mixture of sulphur and\r\nbrown lava. The moistened bed of a small channel, leading from the\r\nspring down the slope, indicated that it had recently overflowed.\r\n\r\n\"A few rods north of this spring, at the base of the hill, is a cavern\r\nwhose mouth is about seven feet in diameter, from which a dense jet of\r\nsulphurous vapor explodes with a regular report like a high-pressure\r\nengine. A little farther along we came upon another boiling spring,\r\nseventy feet long by forty wide, the water of which is dark and muddy\r\nand in unceasing agitation.\r\n\r\n\"About a hundred yards distant we discovered a boiling alum spring,\r\nsurrounded with beautiful crystals, from the border of which we\r\ngathered a quantity of alum, nearly pure, but slightly impregnated\r\nwith iron. The violent ebullition of the water had undermined the\r\nsurrounding surface in many places, and for the distance of several\r\nfeet from the margin had so thoroughly saturated the incrustation with\r\nits liquid contents, that it was unsafe to approach the edge. As one of\r\nour company was unconcernedly passing near the brink, the incrustation\r\nsuddenly sloughed off beneath his feet. A shout of alarm from his\r\ncomrades aroused him to a sense of his peril, and he only avoided being\r\nplunged into the boiling mixture by falling suddenly backward at full\r\nlength upon the firm portion of the crust, and rolling over to a place\r\nof safety. His escape from a horrible death was most marvellous, and in\r\nanother instant he would have been beyond all human aid. Our efforts to\r\nsound the depths of this spring with a pole thirty-five feet in length\r\nwere fruitless.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the Geological Expedition describes these curious\r\nsprings somewhat more minutely. The first that attracted Dr. Hayden's\r\nattention was the powerful steam-vent above mentioned, which he calls\r\nthe Locomotive Jet. \"The aperture is about six inches in diameter, a\r\nsort of raised chimney, and all around are numerous small continuous\r\nsteam-vents, all of which are elegantly lined with the bright-yellow\r\nsulphur. The entire surface is covered with the white silicious\r\ncrust, which gives forth a hollow sound beneath the tread; and we\r\ntook pleasure in breaking it up in the vicinity of the vents, and\r\nexposing the wonderful beauty of the sulphur-coating on the inner\r\nsides. This crust is ever hot, and yet so firm that we could walk over\r\nit anywhere. On the south side of these hills, close to the foot, is\r\na magnificent sulphur-spring. The deposits around it are silica; but\r\nsome places are white, and enamelled like the finest porcelain. The\r\nthin edges of the nearly circular rim extend over the waters of the\r\nbasin several feet, yet the open portion is fifteen feet in diameter.\r\nThe water is in a constant state of agitation. The steam that issues\r\nfrom this spring is so strong and hot that it was only on the windward\r\nside that I could approach it and ascertain its temperature, 197°. The\r\nagitation seemed to affect the entire mass, carrying it up impulsively\r\nto the height of four feet. It may be compared to a huge caldron of\r\nperfectly clear water somewhat superheated. But it is the decorations\r\nabout this spring that lent the charm, after our astonishment at the\r\nseething mass before us--the most beautiful scolloping around the rim,\r\nand the inner and outer surface covered with a sort of pearl-like\r\nbead work. The base is the pure white silica, while the sulphur gave\r\nevery possible shade, from yellow to the most delicate cream. No kind\r\nof embroidering that human art can conceive or fashion could equal\r\nthis specimen of the cunning skill of nature. On the northeast side\r\nof the hills, extending from their summits, are large numbers of the\r\nsteam-vents, with the sulphur linings and deposits of the sulphur over\r\nthe surface. These hills are entirely due to the old hot springs, and\r\nare from 50 to 150 feet in height. The rock is mostly compact silica,\r\nbut there is almost every degree of purity, from a kind of basalt to\r\nthe snow-white silica. Some of it is a real conglomerate, with a fine\r\nsilicious cement inclosing pebbles of white silica, like those seen\r\naround the craters of some geysers. Although at the present time there\r\nare no true geysers in this group, the evidence is clear that these\r\nwere, in former times, very powerful ones, that have built up mountains\r\nof silica by their overflow. The steam-vents on the side and at the\r\nfoot of these hills represent the dying stages of this once most active\r\ngroup. Quite a dense growth of pines now covers these hills, which\r\nrise up in the midst of the plains, and from their peculiar white\r\nappearance are conspicuous for a great distance. At one point there is\r\na steam-vent so hot that it is difficult to approach it, emitting a\r\nstrong sulphurous smell, and within two feet of it there is a larger\r\nspring, boiling like a caldron. So far as I can determine, there is no\r\nunderground connection of any of the springs with each other. Sometimes\r\nthe rims of these craters, as well as the inner sides of their basins,\r\nhave a beautiful papulose surface, the silica just covered with a\r\nthin veil of delicate creamy sulphur. At this locality are some very\r\nremarkable turbid and mud springs. One of them has a basin twenty feet\r\nin diameter, nearly circular in form, and the contents have almost the\r\nconsistency of thick hasty-pudding. Indeed, there is no comparison that\r\ncan bring before the mind a clearer picture of such a mud volcano than\r\na huge caldron of thick mush. The surface is covered all over with\r\npuffs of mud, which, as they burst, give off a thudlike noise, and then\r\nfine mud-waves recede from the centre of the puffs in the most perfect\r\nrings to the side. Although there are hundreds of these mudpots, yet it\r\nis very rare that the mud is in just the condition to admit of these\r\npeculiar rings. The thud is, of course, produced by the escape of the\r\nsulphureted hydrogen gas through the mud. The mud is so fine as to\r\nhave no visible or sensible grain, and is very strongly impregnated\r\nwith alum. For three hundred yards in length and twenty-five yards in\r\nwidth, the valley of this little branch of Alum Creek is perforated\r\nwith these mud-vents of all sizes, and the contents are of all degrees\r\nof consistency, from merely turbid water to a thick mortar. The entire\r\nsurface is perfectly bare of vegetation, and hot, yielding in many\r\nplaces to a slight pressure. I attempted to walk about among these\r\nsimmering vents, and broke through to my knees, covering myself with\r\nthe hot mud, to my great pain and subsequent inconvenience. One of the\r\nlargest of the turbid springs has a basin with a nearly circular rim\r\ntwenty feet from the margin to the water, and forty feet in diameter.\r\nThere are two or three centres of ebullition; temperature, 188°.\"\r\n\r\nA couple of miles above these springs, near the banks of the\r\nYellowstone, is a not less remarkable group of sulphur and mud springs.\r\nAll the intermediate space abounds in the remains of similar springs,\r\nnow quiescent or dead, yet giving evidence of former power and activity\r\nbeyond that displayed by any now existing. \"There were giants in those\r\ndays!\" Mr. Langford describes a group of these \"unsightly caldrons,\"\r\nvarying in size from two to ten feet in diameter; their surfaces from\r\nthree to eight feet below the level of the plain: \"The contents of the\r\nmost of them were of the consistency of thick paint, which they greatly\r\nresembled, some being yellow, others pink, and others dark brown. This\r\nsemi-fluid was boiling at a fearful rate, much after the fashion of\r\na hasty-pudding in the last stages of completion. The bubbles, often\r\ntwo feet in height, would explode with a puff, emitting at each time\r\na villainous smell of sulphuretted vapor. Springs six and eight feet\r\nin diameter, but four feet asunder, presented distinct phenomenal\r\ncharacteristics. There was no connection between them, above or below.\r\nThe sediment varied in color, and not unfrequently there would be\r\nan inequality of five feet in their surfaces. Each, seemingly, was\r\nsupplied with a separate force. They were embraced within a radius of\r\n1,200 feet, which was covered with a strong incrustation, the various\r\nvents in which emitted streams of heated vapor. Our silver watches,\r\nand other metallic articles, assumed a dark leaden hue. The atmosphere\r\nwas filled with sulphurous gases, and the river opposite our camp was\r\nimpregnated with the mineral bases of adjacent springs. At the base\r\nof adjacent foot-hills we found three springs of boiling mud, the\r\nlargest of which, forty feet in diameter, encircled by an elevated\r\nrim of solid tufa, resembles an immense caldron. The seething,\r\nbubbling contents, covered with steam, are five feet below the rim.\r\nThe disgusting appearance of this spring is scarcely atoned for by the\r\nwonder with which it fills the beholder. The other two springs, much\r\nsmaller, but presenting the same general features, are located near a\r\nlarge sulphur spring of milder temperature, but too hot for bathing.\r\nOn the brow of an adjacent hillock, amid the green pines, heated vapor\r\nissues in scorching jets from several craters and fissures. Passing\r\nover the hill, we struck a small stream of perfectly transparent water\r\nflowing from a cavern, the roof of which tapers back to the water,\r\nwhich is boiling furiously, at a distance of twenty feet from the\r\nmouth, and is ejected through it in uniform jets of great force. The\r\nsides and entrance of the cavern are covered with soft, green sediment,\r\nwhich renders the rock on which it is deposited as soft and pliable as\r\nputty.\r\n\r\n\"About two hundred yards from this cave is a most singular phenomenon,\r\nwhich we called the Muddy Geyser. It presents a funnel-shaped orifice,\r\nin the midst of a basin one hundred and fifty feet in diameter, with\r\nsloping sides of clay and sand. The crater or orifice, at the surface,\r\nis thirty by fifty feet in diameter. It tapers quite uniformly to\r\nthe depth of about thirty feet, where the water may be seen, when the\r\ngeyser is in repose, presenting a surface of six or seven feet in\r\nbreadth. The flow of this geyser is regular every six hours. The water\r\nrises gradually, commencing to boil when about half way to the surface,\r\nand occasionally breaking forth in great violence. When the crater is\r\nfilled, it is expelled from it in a splashing, scattered mass, ten or\r\nfifteen feet in thickness, to the height of forty feet. The water is of\r\na dark lead color, and deposits the substance it holds in solution in\r\nthe form of miniature stalagmites upon the sides and top of the crater.\r\nAs this was the first object which approached a geyser, we, naturally\r\nenough, regarded it with intense curiosity....\r\n\r\n\"While returning by a new route to our camp, dull, thundering sounds,\r\nwhich General Washburn likened to frequent discharges of a distant\r\nmortar, broke upon our ears. We followed their direction, and found\r\nthem to proceed from a mud volcano, which occupied the slope of a\r\nsmall hill, embowered in a grove of pines. Dense volumes of steam\r\nshot into the air with each report, through a crater thirty feet in\r\ndiameter. The reports, though irregular, occurred as often as every\r\nfive seconds, and could be distinctly heard half a mile. Each alternate\r\nreport shook the ground a distance of two hundred yards or more, and\r\nthe massive jets of vapor which accompanied them burst forth like the\r\nsmoke of burning gunpowder. It was impossible to stand on the edge of\r\nthat side of the crater opposite the wind, and one of our party, Mr.\r\nHedges, was rewarded for his temerity in venturing too near the rim,\r\nby being thrown by the force of the volume of steam violently down the\r\nouter side of the crater. From hasty views, afforded by occasional\r\ngusts of wind, we could see at a depth of sixty feet the regurgitating\r\ncontents.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MUD VOLCANO.]\r\n\r\n\"This volcano, as is evident from the freshness of the vegetation\r\nand the particles of dried clay adhering to the topmost branches of\r\nthe trees surrounding it, is of very recent formation. Probably it\r\nburst forth but a few months ago. Its first explosion must have been\r\nterrible. We saw limbs of trees 125 feet high encased in clay, and\r\nfound its scattered contents two hundred feet from it.\"\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the Yellowstone, close to the margin of the\r\nriver, are a few turbid springs, and mud-springs strongly impregnated\r\nwith alum. The mud is yellow and contains much sulphur. These, the\r\ndiscoverers, Dr. Hayden and his company, called Mud-sulphur Springs.\r\nThe main basin is 15 by 30 feet, and has three centres of ebullition,\r\nshowing that deep in the earth are three independent orifices for the\r\nemission of heated waters. Dr. Hayden's description of the roaring\r\nspring issuing from a cavern, coincides with that given above. He\r\ncalled it the Grotto. Around all these springs he observed an abundance\r\nof grasses, rushes, mosses, and other plants growing with a surprising\r\nluxuriance. The recent mud-volcano described by Mr. Langford was\r\nconsidered by Dr. Hayden as the most remarkable mud-spring thus far\r\ndiscovered in the West.\r\n\r\n\"It does not boil with an impulse like most of the mud-springs,\"\r\nhe says, \"but with a constant roar which shakes the ground for a\r\nconsiderable distance, and may be heard for half a mile. A dense column\r\nof steam is ever rising, filling the crater, but now and then a passing\r\nbreeze will remove it for a moment, revealing one of the most terrific\r\nsights one could well imagine. The contents are composed of thin mud\r\nin a continual state of the most violent agitation, like an immense\r\ncaldron of mush submitted to a constant, uniform, but most intense\r\nheat.... All the indications around this most remarkable caldron show\r\nthat it has broken out at a recent period; that the caving in of the\r\nsides so choked up the orifice that it relieved itself, hurling the\r\nmuddy contents over the living pines in the vicinity.\"\r\n\r\nThe steam rising from this spring--the Giant's Caldron--can be seen\r\nfor many miles in every direction. The movements of Muddy Geyser were\r\nclosely watched for twenty-four hours by Mr. Campbell Carrington, who\r\nwas specially detailed for that duty by Dr. Hayden. His observations\r\nbegan about nine o'clock A.M., July 1st. Then the pool was calm.\r\nShortly after, he heard the loud, hissing noise of escaping steam.\r\nHurrying to the geyser, he saw a wave about three feet in height\r\nrise and die away to the left; three similar waves followed in quick\r\nsuccession. Their dense columns of steam burst up to the height of\r\ntwenty feet, with a dull, heavy explosion, the action continuing for\r\nfifteen minutes, when the spring ceased flowing as suddenly as it\r\nhad begun. The average height of the flowing was about fifteen feet,\r\nthough some of the jets reached fully thirty feet. Five minutes after\r\nthe eruption the pool measured twenty-five feet in circumference and\r\nthree in depth, where before it was a hundred feet in circumference and\r\neleven in depth. Ten minutes later the mud began to rise slowly in the\r\npool. This continued for a little over three hours, when the spring\r\nbegan to boil near the centre. The ebullition gradually increased in\r\nviolence for twenty minutes, then it suddenly stopped, and the eruption\r\nbegan as at first. This rising, falling, and overflowing took place\r\neight times in twenty-four hours. The following table shows the time of\r\nthe observed flowings and their length:\r\n\r\n\"First flowing, 9.20 A.M. to 9.35 A.M.; length, 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Second flowing, 1.30 P.M. to 1.50 P.M.; length, 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Third flowing, 5 P.M. to 5.15 P.M.; length, 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth flowing, 8.30 P.M. to 8.50 P.M.; length, 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth flowing, 12.30 P.M. to 12.45 P.M.; length, 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Sixth flowing, 4 A.M. to 4.15 A.M.; length, 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Seventh flowing, 7.30 A.M. to 7.45 A.M.; length, 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Eighth flowing, 11 A.M. to 11.10 A.M.; length, 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Total length of time, 26 hours. Aggregate time of flowing, three hours\r\nand 15 minutes. Average length of flowings, 15 minutes and 37 and one\r\nhalf seconds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nYELLOWSTONE LAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Such a vision,\" exclaims the sober-minded chief of the Geological\r\nSurvey, \"is worth a lifetime; and only _one_ of such marvellous beauty\r\nwill ever greet human eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Secluded amid the loftiest peaks of the Rocky Mountains,\" writes Mr.\r\nLangford, \"possessing strange peculiarities of form and beauty, this\r\nwatery solitude is one of the most attractive natural objects in the\r\nworld. Its southern shore, indented with long narrow inlets, not unlike\r\nthe frequent fiords of Iceland, bears testimony to the awful upheaval\r\nand tremendous force of the elements which resulted in its creation.\r\nThe long pine-crowned promontories, stretching into it from the base\r\nof the hills, lend new and charming features to an aquatic scene full\r\nof novelty and splendor. Islands of emerald hue dot its surface, and\r\na margin of sparkling sand forms its jewelled setting. The winds,\r\ncompressed in their passage through the mountain gorges, lash it into\r\na sea as terrible as the fretted ocean, covering it with foam. But now\r\nit lay before us calm and unruffled, save by the gentle wavelets which\r\nbroke in murmurs along the shore. Water, one of the grandest elements\r\nof scenery, never seemed so beautiful before. It formed a fitting\r\nclimax to all the wonders we had seen, and we gazed upon it for hours,\r\nentranced with its increasing attractions.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful sheet of water so enthusiastically yet fittingly\r\ndescribed, is somewhat more than twenty miles long and fifteen broad,\r\nwith an irregular outline, presenting some of the loveliest shore-lines\r\nthat water ever assumed. Its form has been compared to that of an\r\noutspread hand, the northern portion representing the palm, the\r\nsouthwestern a swollen thumb, the first and second fingers aborted, the\r\nthird and fourth disproportionately large. A glance at the map will\r\nshow that a juster comparison would be to the head and shoulders of\r\nsome grotesque animal with two slender ears and a pair of huge knobby\r\nhorns--the head facing the north. The greatest stretch of water extends\r\nfrom the end of the heavy lower jaw (the outlet of the Yellowstone) to\r\nthe top of the upper horn, where the Upper Yellowstone comes in; while\r\nthe great body of the water lies between the forehead and the base of\r\nthe shoulder. The superficial area of the lake is about three hundred\r\nsquare miles; its greatest depth 300 feet, and its elevation above the\r\nsea 7,427 feet. In the last respect it has but one rival, Lake Titicaca\r\nin South America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YELLOWSTONE LAKE.]\r\n\r\nLying upon the very crown of the continent, Yellowstone Lake receives\r\nno tributaries of any considerable size, its clear cold water coming\r\nsolely from the snows that fall on the lofty mountain ranges that\r\nhem it in on every side. In the early part of the day, when the air\r\nis still and the bright sunshine falls on its unruffled surface, its\r\nbright green color, shading to a delicate ultramarine, commands the\r\nadmiration of every beholder. Later in the day, when the mountain\r\nwinds come down from their icy heights, it puts on an aspect more in\r\naccordance with the fierce wilderness around it. Its shores are paved\r\nwith volcanic rocks, sometimes in masses, sometimes broken and worn\r\ninto pebbles of trachyte, obsidian, chalcedony, cornelians, agates, and\r\nbits of agatized wood; and again, ground to obsidian-sand and sprinkled\r\nwith crystals of California diamonds. Here and there hot-spring\r\ndeposits show wave-worn bluffs of the purest white; and in sheltered\r\nbays, clay-concretions and casts from mud-puffs strew the beach with\r\ncurious forms, that exploring trappers mistook for the drinking cups,\r\nstone war-clubs, and broken idols of some extinct race.\r\n\r\nVegetation is abundant in the lake as well as around it. Several\r\nspecies of plants grow far out into the deep waters, living thickly on\r\nrocks twenty feet below the surface. After a severe storm their uptorn\r\nstems strew the beach like kelp on the seashore, and the water is\r\ndiscolored with vegetable matter for several yards from the shore. The\r\nwater swarms with trout, but there is no other kind of fish, no shells,\r\nno shell-fish,--nothing but trout. Of these, Mr. Carrington, the\r\nnaturalist of the Geological Survey, reports the following interesting\r\nobservations:\r\n\r\n\"Although I searched with diligence and care in the neighboring\r\nstreams and waters around the Yellowstone Lake, I was unable to find\r\nany other species of fish except the salmon-trout; their numbers are\r\nalmost inconceivable; average weight, one pound and a half; color, a\r\nlight-grey above, passing into a light-yellow below; the fins, all\r\nexcept the dorsal and caudal, vary from a bright-yellow to a brilliant\r\norange, they being a dark-grey and heavily spotted. A curious fact, and\r\none well worthy of the closest attention of an aspiring icthyologist,\r\nis connected with these fish, namely, that among their intestines, and\r\neven interlaced in their solid flesh, are found intestinal worms,\r\nvarying in size, length, and thickness, the largest measuring about six\r\ninches in length. On cutting one of these trout open, the first thing\r\nthat attracts your attention is small oleaginous-looking spots clinging\r\nto the intestines, which, on being pressed between the fingers, break\r\nand change into one of these worms, small, it is true, but nevertheless\r\nperfect in its formation. From five or six up to forty or fifty will\r\nbe found in a trout, varying, as I said before, in size, the larger\r\nones being found in the solid flesh, through which they work their way,\r\nand which, in a very short while, becomes almost putrid. Their number\r\ncan generally be estimated from the appearance of the fish itself; if\r\nmany, the trout is extremely poor in flesh, the color changes from the\r\nhealthy grey to a dull pale, it swims lazily near the top of the water,\r\nlosing all its shyness and fear of man; it becomes almost savage in its\r\nappetite, biting voraciously at anything thrown in the water, and its\r\nflesh becomes soft and yielding. If, on the other hand, there are few\r\nor none, the flesh of the fish is plump and solid, and he is quick and\r\nsprightly in all his motions. I noticed that it was almost invariably\r\nthe case when a trout had several scars on the outside of his body that\r\nit was free from these worms, and I therefore took it for granted that\r\nthe worms finally worked their way through the body, and the flesh,\r\non healing up, leaves the scars on the outside; the trout, in a short\r\nwhile, becomes plump and healthy again. The only way that I can account\r\nfor the appearance of these worms is, that the fish swallows certain\r\nbugs or insects, and that the larvæ formed from them gradually develop\r\ninto the full-grown intestinal worm. But even if this explanation of\r\ntheir appearance was received, does it not seem a little strange that\r\nwhile all the fish above the Upper Falls are more or less affected by\r\nthem, that below and even between the Upper and Lower Falls such a\r\nthing as wormy trout is never heard of? Being unable, with my limited\r\nknowledge of icthyology, to arrive at any definite conclusion in regard\r\nto their appearance, I submit the above facts to those who are more\r\nlearned than myself in this most interesting branch of natural history.\"\r\n\r\nWaterfowl make up in number and variety for the lack of life within the\r\nlake. The surface fairly swarms with them. Lieutenant Doane enumerates\r\nswans, pelicans, gulls, geese, brants, and many varieties of ducks\r\nand dippers; also herons and sand-hill cranes. The pelicans are very\r\nplentiful, immense fleets of them sailing in company with the majestic\r\nswan, and at nightfall the low, flat islands in the lake are white with\r\nthem. The gulls are of the same variety as those of San Francisco\r\nHarbor. Eagles, hawks, ravens, ospreys, prairie chickens, grouse,\r\nmocking-birds and woodpeckers are common in and around the lake basin.\r\nMention is also made of a guide-bird, whose habits correspond with its\r\nname. It resembles the blackbird, but is larger. Lieutenant Doane says:\r\n\r\n\"I saw but one of these--the day I went to the bottom of the Grand\r\nCañon; it hopped and flew along from rock to rock ahead of us during\r\nthe whole trip down, waited perched upon a rock while we were resting,\r\nand led us clear to the summit again in the same manner, making\r\ninnumerable sounds and gestures constantly to attract attention. Others\r\nof the party remarked birds of the same kind and acting in the same\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\nHerds of deer, elk, and mountain sheep, throng the forests and mountain\r\nmeadows about the lake. Buffalo signs, grizzly bears and California\r\nlions are far from uncommon, while the smaller lakes and creek-valleys\r\nof the basin are fairly alive with otter, beaver, mink, and muskrats.\r\nLieutenant Doane observed several unnamed and undescribed species of\r\nsquirrels and weasels, and doubtless there are many other new varieties\r\nof animal life peculiar to this little-known region. One department of\r\nnatural history, however, is happily unrepresented in the basin. There\r\nare no snakes, though rattlesnakes are plentiful down the Yellowstone.\r\n\r\nThere are but two considerable islands in the lake--Stephenson's and\r\nFrank's--each about a mile long, narrow and covered with a thick growth\r\nof pines. Dot Island, near Frank's, a small lozenge-shaped mud-bank,\r\nnot over a third of a mile long, and half a dozen of smaller size,\r\nusually near the shore, complete the list.\r\n\r\nThe first explorers constructed a rude raft for the purpose of visiting\r\nthese islands and exploring the shore-line of the lake, but it was\r\nspeedily wrecked by the choppy waves beat up by the sudden gusts\r\nfrom the mountains. The Geological Expedition took the precaution to\r\ncarry from Fort Ellis the framework of a little craft, twelve feet\r\nlong, three and a half feet wide, and twenty-two inches deep, which,\r\ncovered with well-tarred canvas, made a very serviceable boat for\r\nfair-weather navigation. \"Our little bark, whose keel was the first\r\nto plow the waters of the most beautiful lake on the continent,\" says\r\nDr. Hayden, \"was named by Mr. Stephenson in compliment to Miss Anna L.\r\nDawes, the amiable daughter of Hon. H. L. Dawes. My whole party,\" he\r\nadds, \"were glad to manifest, by this slight tribute, their gratitude\r\nto the distinguished statesman, whose generous sympathy and aid had\r\ncontributed so much toward securing the appropriation which enabled\r\nthem to explore this marvellous region.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST BOAT ON YELLOWSTONE LAKE.]\r\n\r\nThe little craft rode the waves well and performed excellent service.\r\nIts first voyage was to Stephenson's Island, named after the first\r\nassistant of the expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAROUND YELLOWSTONE LAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Yellowstone leaves the Lake with an easy flow in a channel a\r\nquarter of a mile wide, and deep enough to swim a horse. A mile to the\r\neastward of the outlet is the mouth of Pelican Creek, whose swampy\r\nvalley is the resort of myriads of waterfowl. On the northern side,\r\nthree or four miles from the lake, Sulphur Hills stand as monuments of\r\na once magnificent system of boiling springs.\r\n\r\nThe deposit covers the side of the mountain to an elevation of 600 feet\r\nabove the lake shore. The huge white mass of silica, covering an area\r\nhalf a mile square, can be seen from any position on the lake shore,\r\nwhence it appears like an immense bank of snow. In the valley near\r\nPelican Creek, a few springs issue from beneath the crust, distributing\r\ntheir waters over the bottom and depositing oxide of iron, sulphur,\r\nand silica in the most beautiful blending of gay colors. Although\r\nthe waters of the springs are 160° in temperature, the channels are\r\nlined with a thick growth of mosses and other plants, and in the water\r\nis an abundance of vividly green vegetation. The mass of hot-spring\r\nmaterial built up here cannot be less than 400 feet in thickness. A\r\nlarge portion of it is pudding-stone or conglomerate. Some of the\r\nmasses inclosed in the fine white silicious cement are themselves\r\nglobes of pure white silica, eight inches in diameter. It is plain,\r\nfrom the evidence still remaining, that this old ruin has been the\r\ntheatre of tremendous geyser action at some period not very remote,\r\nand that the steam-vents, which are very numerous, represent only the\r\ndying stages. These vents or chimneys are richly adorned with brilliant\r\nyellow sulphur, sometimes as a hard amorphous coating, and sometimes in\r\ndelicate crystals that vanish like frost-work at the touch. It seems\r\nthat it is only during the last stages of these springs that they adorn\r\nthemselves with these brilliant and vivid colors.\r\n\r\nHot springs are scattered along the valley of the creek for several\r\nmiles, some of them of considerable size and beauty. The average width\r\nof the valley is about two miles; the heat from the springs and the\r\nextremely fertile soil combining to fill the valley with abundant\r\nvegetation. At the northeastern corner of the lake, five or six miles\r\nfrom the outlet, is a long, low spit of land built out into the lake\r\nby ancient geyser action. A few roaring steam-vents, giving name\r\nto the point, are all that remain of the violent action that once\r\ncharacterized the place. The hot spring area is four or five miles\r\nlong by two wide; the ground in many places being perforated like a\r\ncullender with simmering vents. A mile or so from the lake is a large\r\npond where there is another extensive group of springs, depositing\r\nsulphur, alum, common salt, and staining the ground with oxide of iron.\r\n\r\nSouth of Steam Point is a small bay bounded by a deposit of yellow\r\nclay, full of the remarkable concretions already referred to.\r\nFurther up the eastern shore are pebbly beaches strewn with agates\r\ncornelians, and chips of chalcedony. Beyond, the narrow lake-shore is\r\nquite impassable. The adjacent lowlands, and the higher levels and\r\nhill-slopes further back, are almost as difficult of penetration, owing\r\nto the dense growth of lofty pines and the interminable fire-slashes\r\nthat cover large areas. These fire-slashes are due to autumnal fires\r\nwhich sweep through the forests, burning the vegetable mould, so that\r\nthe trees are left without support, and the first wind lays them down\r\nin the wildest confusion. Through these networks of fallen timber it\r\nis with the utmost difficulty that a passage can be forced. All the\r\nexplorers speak of the exasperating nature of their tribulations in\r\nthese wildernesses.\r\n\r\nMr. Langford treats it with characteristic good humor.\r\n\r\n\"Ascending the plateau from the beach,\" he says, \"we became at once\r\ninvolved in all the intricacies of a primeval wilderness of pines.\r\nDifficulties increased with our progress through it, severely trying\r\nthe amiability of every member of the company. Our pack-horses would\r\nfrequently get wedged between the trees or caught in the traps of a\r\nnetwork of fallen trunks, from which labor, patience, and ingenuity\r\nwere severely taxed to extricate them. The ludicrous sometimes\r\ncame to our relief, proving that there was nothing so effectual in\r\nallaying excitement as hearty laughter. We had a remarkable pony in\r\nour pack-train, which, from the moment we entered the forest, by his\r\nnumerous acrobatic performances and mishaps furnished amusement for the\r\ncompany. One part of the process of travel through this forest could\r\nonly be accomplished by leaping over the fallen trunks, an exploit\r\nwhich, with all the spirit needful for the purpose, our little broncho\r\nlacked the power always to perform. As a consequence, he was frequently\r\nfound with the feat half accomplished, resting upon the midriff, his\r\nfore and hind feet suspended over the opposite sides of some huge log.\r\nHis ambition to excel was only equalled by the patience he exhibited\r\nin difficulty. On one occasion, while clambering a steep rocky ascent,\r\nhis head overtopping his haunches, he literally performed three of the\r\nmost wonderful backward headsprings ever recorded in equine history. A\r\ncontinued experience of this kind, after three weeks' toilsome travel,\r\nfound him as sound as on the day of its commencement, and we dubbed him\r\nthe 'Little Invulnerable.'\"\r\n\r\nIn another place Mr. Langford writes:\r\n\r\n\"Our journey of five miles, the next day, was accomplished with great\r\ndifficulty and annoyance. Almost the entire distance was through a\r\nforest piled full of fallen trunks. Travelling was but another name for\r\nscrambling; and as man is at times the least amiable of animals, our\r\ntempers frequently displayed alarming activity, not only towards the\r\npatient creatures laden with our stores, but towards each other. Once,\r\nwhile involved in the reticulated meshes of a vast net of branches\r\nand tree-tops, each man, with varied expletive emphasis, clamorously\r\ninsisting upon a particular mode of extrication, a member of the party,\r\nwho was always jolly, restored us to instant good-humor by repeating,\r\nin theatrical tone and manner, those beautiful lines from Childe\r\nHarold:--\r\n\r\n  \"There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,\r\n  There is a rapture on the lonely shore.\"\r\n\r\nOur 'Little Invulnerable,' too, was the unconscious cause of many\r\nbursts of laughter, which, like the plaudits of an appreciative\r\naudience, came in at the right time.\"\r\n\r\nThe eastern rim of the Yellowstone Basin is formed by one of the\r\ngrandest volcanic ranges in the world, the general level of their\r\nsummits being about 10,000 feet above the sea, while numerous peaks\r\nthrust their rugged crests a thousand feet higher into the sky. Mr.\r\nLangford and Lieutenant Doane were the first to penetrate this range,\r\nclimbing with great labor one of the highest of the groups of lofty\r\npeaks near the southeast corner of the Lake.\r\n\r\n\"The grandeur and vast extent of the view from this elevation,\" writes\r\nMr. Langford, \"beggar description. The lake and valley surrounding\r\nit lay seemingly at our feet within jumping distance. Beyond them we\r\nsaw with great distinctness the jets of the mud volcano and geyser.\r\nBut beyond all these, stretching away into a horizon of cloud-defined\r\nmountains, was the entire Wind River range, revealing in the sunlight\r\nthe dark recesses, gloomy cañons, stupendous precipices, and glancing\r\npinnacles, which everywhere dotted its jagged slopes. Lofty peaks shot\r\nup in gigantic spires from the main body of the range, glittering in\r\nthe sunbeams like solid crystal. The mountain on which we stood was the\r\nmost westerly peak of a range which, in long-extended volume, swept to\r\nthe southeastern horizon, exhibiting a continuous elevation more than\r\nthirty miles in width; its central line broken into countless points,\r\nknobs, glens, and defiles, all on the most colossal scale of grandeur\r\nand magnificence. Outside of these, on either border, along the entire\r\nrange, lofty peaks rose at intervals, seemingly vying with each other\r\nin the varied splendors they presented to the beholder. The scene\r\nwas full of majesty. The valley at the base of this range was dotted\r\nwith small lakes and cloven centrally by the river, which, in the far\r\ndistance, we could see emerging from a cañon of immense dimensions,\r\nwithin the shade of which two enormous jets of steam shot to an\r\nincredible height into the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the lake and this group of mountains--the three highest of\r\nwhich bear the names of Langford, Doane, and Stephenson--is Brimstone\r\nBasin. For several miles the ground is impregnated with sulphur, and\r\nthe air is tainted with sulphurous exhalations. Streams of warm\r\nsulphur-water course the hillsides and unite to form a considerable\r\nrivulet called Alum Creek, whose channel is coated with a creamy-white\r\nmixture of silica and sulphur. Old pine logs, once lofty trees, lie\r\nprostrate in every direction over the basin, which covers an area some\r\nthree miles in extent. From all appearances this basin must have been\r\nthe scene of thermal activity within a comparatively recent period; but\r\nnow not a spring can be found with a temperature above that of ordinary\r\nspring-water. Similar brimstone basins are numerous around the lake,\r\non the lower slopes of the mountains, at the foot of bluffs, or more\r\nfrequently in level districts. The latter are always wet, and generally\r\nimpassable, the thin crust covering an abundance of scalding mud,\r\nespecially dangerous to horses.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Yellowstone rises in the high volcanic range which shuts off\r\nthe Yellowstone Basin from the Wind River drainage, forming what is\r\nknown as the great water-shed of the continent.\r\n\r\nThis range of mountains has a marvellous history. As it is the\r\nloftiest, so it is the most remarkable lateral ridge of the Rocky\r\nRange. The Indians regard it as the \"crest of the world,\" and among\r\nthe Blackfeet there is a fable that he who attains its summit catches\r\na view of the land of souls, and beholds the happy hunting-grounds\r\nspread out below him, brightening with the abodes of free and generous\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nIn the expedition sent across the continent by Mr. Astor, in 1811,\r\nunder command of Captain Wilson P. Hunt, that gentleman met with the\r\nfirst serious obstacle to his progress at the base of this range. After\r\nnumerous efforts to scale it, he turned away and followed the valley\r\nof the Snake, encountering the most discouraging disasters until he\r\narrived at Astoria.\r\n\r\nLater, in 1833, the indomitable Captain Bonneville was lost in this\r\nmountain labyrinth, and, after devising various modes of escape,\r\nfinally determined to ascend the range, which tremendous task he\r\nsucceeded in accomplishing, in company with one of his men. It was this\r\nsame line of snow-clad, craggy peaks that turned back Captain Raynolds\r\nin 1859.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREAKING THROUGH.]\r\n\r\nNear its mouth the Upper Yellowstone is about half the size of the main\r\nstream as it leaves the lake. Its valley is about three miles wide\r\nand very marshy; all the little streams flowing down from the wooded\r\nhill-slopes being obstructed by beaver-dams, so as to form continuous\r\nchains of ponds. The sides of the valley are dark, sombre walls of\r\nvolcanic rock, which weathers into curious and imposing forms. Looking\r\nup the valley from some high point, one almost imagines himself in\r\nthe presence of the ruins of some gigantic city, so much like ancient\r\ncastles and cathedrals do these rocks appear--a deception that is not\r\na little heightened by the singular vertical furrows cut deep into the\r\ncliffs. At the base of the walls immense masses of breccia have fallen\r\nfrom the mountain tops, in many instances cutting long swaths through\r\nthe pine forests. In the upper part of the valley, which in midsummer\r\nis lush with vegetation, five streams flow down from the mountains\r\nto swell the waters of the Yellowstone. These streams Colonel Barlow\r\ncalls, in honor of his commander's greatest victory, the Five Forks.\r\nHere the valley terminates abruptly, the mountains rising like walls\r\nand shutting off the country beyond. Just at the head of the valley is\r\na little lake, a hundred yards or so in width; the large lake which has\r\nbeen placed on maps as Bridger's Lake having no existence. Dr. Hayden\r\nwith two assistants ascended the mountains to the west of the head of\r\nthe valley to survey the district bordering on the great divide. From\r\nthis point as far as the eye can reach on every side are bare, bald\r\npeaks, domes and ridges in great numbers. At least one hundred peaks\r\nworthy of a name can be located within the radius of vision. The rocks\r\neverywhere, though massive, black, and deeply furrowed vertically, have\r\nthe appearance of horizontal stratification. In some instances the\r\nfurrows are so regular that the breccia has a columnar appearance. The\r\nsummits of the mountains are composed entirely of breccia, containing\r\nangular masses of trachyte, from 10 to 30 feet in diameter, though most\r\nof the fragments are small. Dr. Hayden's party camped at night near a\r\nsmall lake, by the side of a bank of snow, 10,000 feet above the sea,\r\nwith short spring grass and flowers all around them. There are but two\r\nseasons on these mountain summits, spring and winter; as late as August\r\nfresh new grass may be seen springing up where a huge bank of snow has\r\njust disappeared. Little spring-flowers, seldom more than two or three\r\ninches high, cover the ground--_Clatonia_, _Viola_, _Ranunculus_, and\r\nmany others. The following morning they travelled for several miles\r\nalong a ridge not more than two hundred yards wide, from one side of\r\nwhich the waters flow into the Pacific, and on the other, into the\r\nAtlantic. To the westward the outlines of the Teton Range, with its\r\nshark-teeth summits, are most clearly visible, covered with snow. From\r\nwhatever point of view, the sharp-pointed peaks of this range have\r\nthe form of huge sharks' teeth. To the southward, for fifty miles at\r\nleast, nothing but igneous rocks can be seen. Toward the Tetons there\r\nis a series of high ridges, passing off from the main Teton Range\r\ntoward the northeast, and varying in height from 9,500 to 10,500 feet\r\nabove the sea, and from 1,000 to 1,800 feet above the valleys at their\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nThe explorers ascended one of the high ridges, (not the highest,\r\nhowever,) and found it to be 1,650 feet above the valley at its foot.\r\nThe northeast side is steep like a roof, the southwest breaking off\r\nabruptly. From the summit of this ridge, the view is grand in the\r\nextreme. To the westward the entire country, for the distance of fifty\r\nmiles, seems to have been thrown up into high, sharp ridges, with\r\ngorges 1,000 to 1,500 feet in depth. Beautiful lakes, grassy meadows\r\nalso, come within the field of vision. \"I can conceive,\" says Dr.\r\nHayden, \"of no more wonderful and attractive region for the explorer.\r\nIt would not be difficult for the traveller to make his way among these\r\ngrand gorges, penetrating every valley, and ascending every mountain\r\nand ridge. The best of grass, wood, water and game are abundant to\r\nsupply the wants of himself and animals.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he continues, \"that numerous passes could be found from the\r\nvalley of Snake River to the basin of the Yellowstone. It seems to me\r\nthere are many points on the south rim of the basin where a road could\r\nbe made with ease into the valley of Snake River. From this ridge there\r\nappears to be but little difference in the altitude of Yellowstone\r\nLake and Heart Lake, and they cannot be more than eight or ten miles\r\napart, and yet the latter is one of the sources of Snake River. The\r\nlittle branches of Snake River nearly interlace with some streams that\r\nflow into the lake, and the gullies come up within two miles of the\r\nshore-line. There is a very narrow dividing ridge in one place, between\r\nthe drainage, which may be within one mile of the lake.\"\r\n\r\nHeart Lake was visited by Colonel Barlow, who found it a pretty,\r\npear-shaped sheet of water, four miles long and two wide in its\r\nbroadest part. From the north it receives a warm creek fed by a\r\nconsiderable group of hot springs. Its outlet at the southern end joins\r\nthe terminal creek of Snake River, a few miles from its source among\r\nthe Yellowstone Mountains.\r\n\r\nTen miles northwest of Heart Lake is Madison Lake, the source of\r\nMadison River, the country between being a somewhat rugged range of\r\nmountains, of which Red Mountain is the most conspicuous. To the\r\neastward from Heart Lake is Mount Sheridan, from the summit of which\r\na magnificent view of the Yellowstone Basin can be obtained. Nearer\r\nthe great lake is Flat Mountain, whose altitude falls a little short\r\nof 10,000 feet. Between Flat Mountain and the Yellowstone Range the\r\ndivide is very low, some of the branches of Snake River extending up to\r\nwithin two miles of the lake, where the elevation is not more than 400\r\nfeet above the lake level. It is doubtless this singular interlacing\r\nof the headwaters of the Yellowstone and Snake River that gave rise to\r\nBridger's story of the \"Two Ocean River.\"\r\n\r\nAt sunrise on the morning of August 10th, at the west base of Flat\r\nMountain, the thermometer stood at 15½° Fah., and water froze in Dr.\r\nHayden's tent that night a quarter of an inch thick. It was in this\r\nneighborhood that Mr. Everts was lost from the first expedition.\r\n\r\nThe country between Flat Mountain and the hot springs at the\r\nsouthwestern extremity of the lake is a level plateau with alternating\r\nspaces of grassy glade and dense thickets of pine around and between a\r\nperfect network of small, lily-covered lakes. The hot springs on the\r\nlake shore are numerous and of great variety and interest. There are\r\nno true geysers, however, though some of the springs are pulsating\r\nsprings, the water rising and falling in their orifices with great\r\nregularity. Higher up the bank are a large number of mud-springs, two\r\nor three hundred in all, of variable temperatures, the most of them\r\nnot differing materially from those already described. Some, however,\r\nhave a character strikingly unique. The area covered by the springs\r\nis about three miles long and half a mile wide, a portion of it\r\nreaching out into the lake. Some of the submerged springs have built up\r\nfunnel-shaped craters of silicious deposit, from five to twenty feet in\r\nheight, rising from the bottom to the surface of the water. Extending\r\na pole over the deep water, members of Dr. Hayden's party caught trout\r\nand cooked them in these boiling springs out in the lake without\r\nremoving them from the hook.\r\n\r\nFour hundred yards from the lake shore is a large boiling basin of\r\npink-colored mud, seventy feet in diameter, with a rim of conical mud\r\ncraters, which project the hot mud in every direction. The deposit\r\nspeedily hardens into a firm, laminated stone, of beautiful texture,\r\nthough the brilliant pink color fades to a chalky white. Near and\r\naround this basin are a dozen springs, from six to twenty-five feet\r\nacross, boiling muddy water of a paint-like consistency, varying in\r\ncolor from pure white to dark yellow. Close by are several flowing\r\nsprings of clear hot water, from ten to fifty feet in diameter, their\r\nbasins and channels lined with deposits of red, green, yellow, and\r\nblack, giving them an appearance of gorgeous splendor. The bright\r\ncolors are on the surface of the rock only, which is too friable\r\nto be preserved. Below these springs are several large craters of\r\nbluish water, boiling to the height of two feet in the centre, and\r\ndischarging large streams of water; their rims are raised a few inches\r\nin a delicate rock-margin of a fringe-like appearance, deposited from\r\nthe water. Beyond these are two lakes of purple water, hot, but not\r\nboiling, and giving deposits of great beauty. Near by are two more blue\r\nsprings, one thirty by forty feet, and 173° in temperature. This spring\r\ndischarges a considerable stream into the other, which is seventy feet\r\ndistant, and six feet lower. The latter is forty feet by seventy-five,\r\n183° in temperature, and discharges a stream of one hundred inches.\r\nThe craters of these springs are lined with a silvery-white deposit of\r\nsilica, which reflect the light so as to illuminate the water to an\r\nimmense depth. Both craters have perpendicular but irregular walls, and\r\nthe distance to which objects are visible down in their deep abysses is\r\ntruly wonderful.\r\n\r\nWest of these is another group of clear watered hot springs, which\r\nsurpass all the rest in singularity if not in beauty. These have\r\nbasins of different sizes and immeasurable depth, in which float what\r\nappear like raw bullock hides as they look in a tanner's vat, waving\r\nsluggishly with every undulation of the water. On examination, this\r\nleathery substance proves to be of fragile texture, like the vegetable\r\nscum of stagnant pools, and brilliantly colored red, yellow, green,\r\netc., black on the under side. This singular substance is about two\r\ninches in thickness, jelly-like to the touch, and is composed largely\r\nof vegetable matter, which Dr. Hayden thinks to be diatoms.\r\n\r\nOf the beautiful transparency of the springs above described, Dr.\r\nHayden says: \"So clear was the water that the smallest object could\r\nbe seen on the sides of the basin; and as the breeze swept across the\r\nsurface, the ultramarine hue of the transparent depth in the bright\r\nsunlight was the most dazzlingly beautiful sight I ever beheld. There\r\nwere a number of these large clear springs, but not more than two or\r\nthree that exhibited all those brilliant shades, from deep sea green to\r\nultramarine.\"\r\n\r\nOccasionally, says Lieutenant Doane, this anomaly is seen, namely: \"two\r\nsprings, at different levels, both boiling violently; one pours a large\r\nand constant stream into the other, yet the former does not diminish,\r\nnor does the latter fill up and overflow.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the springs, however, seem to be independent of each other,\r\nsince they have different levels at the surface, different temperatures\r\nand pulsations, and rarely are the waters and deposits of any two\r\nexactly alike.\r\n\r\nPassing northward through dense woods and almost impenetrable\r\nfire-slashes, the next noteworthy region arrived at is the valley of\r\nBridge Creek, the creek receiving its name from a natural bridge of\r\ntrachyte thrown across the stream. The bridge is narrow, affording\r\nscanty room for the well-worn elk-trail two feet wide, while the\r\ndescent on either hand is so great that a fall from the bridge would\r\nbe fatal to man or beast. Numerous herds of elk make daily use of this\r\nconvenient passway.\r\n\r\nDead and dying springs are abundant all along the valley of this creek,\r\nthe most of them being reduced to mere steam-vents. In one place the\r\nspring deposits cover several acres and present a most attractive\r\npicture. The ground is thickly covered with conical mounds, from a few\r\ninches in diameter to a hundred feet, full of steaming orifices lined\r\nwith brillant sulphur-crystals. The under side of the heated crust is\r\neverywhere adorned in the same manner. The basis of the deposit is\r\nsnow-white silica, but it is variegated with every shade of yellow\r\nfrom sulphur, and with scarlet from oxide of iron. From a distance the\r\nwhole region has the appearance of a vast lime-kiln in full operation.\r\nMost of the country has been eroded into rounded hills from fifty to\r\ntwo hundred feet high, composed of the whitish-yellow and pinkish clays\r\nand sands of the modern lake deposit, which seems to prevail more or\r\nless all round the rim of the basin, reaching several hundred feet\r\nabove the present level of the lake.\r\n\r\nBetween Bridge Creek and the outlet of the lake, completing the circuit\r\nof the basin, is the Elephant's Back, a long, low mountain, noticeable\r\nonly for its rounded summit and precipitous sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nUPPER GEYSER BASIN OF FIREHOLE RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust over the western margin of the Yellowstone Basin, yet within\r\nthe limits of our great National Park, is the grand geyser region of\r\nFirehole River. Here, in a valley a dozen miles long and two or three\r\nwide, is an exhibition of boiling and spouting springs on a scale so\r\nstupendous that if all the corresponding phenomena of all the rest of\r\nthe world could be brought into an equal area the display would seem as\r\nnothing in comparison.\r\n\r\nFirehole River, the main fork of the Madison, has its source in Madison\r\nLake, a beautiful sheet of water set like a gem among the mountains,\r\ndense forests of pines coming down to the very shores. A pointed ridge\r\nextends into the lake on the west side about half a mile, giving it the\r\nform of a heart. Its area is about three miles from north to south,\r\nand two from east to west. Its shores are paved with masses of trachyte\r\nand obsidian. The high mountains about the lake and along the river are\r\ngashed with deep gorges, with steep and jagged sides. Pines grow upon\r\nthe mountain-sides where the declivity is so great that they cannot be\r\nscaled. In the obstructed gorges and on the mountain-tops, from 9,000\r\nto 10,000 feet above the sea, little lakes occur every mile or so,\r\nnestled among the pines. Clear-watered mountain-torrents tumble down\r\nthe almost vertical ridges to swell the Firehole, making cascades that\r\nin any other region would enjoy world-wide fame. Just before reaching\r\nthe geyser-basin, some ten miles below the lake, the river roars\r\nthrough a deep gorge in the trachyte rock, and as it emerges, dashes\r\nover two cliffs, one twenty, the other fifty feet in height. \"These\r\npretty falls,\" writes Lieutenant Doane, \"if located on an Eastern\r\nstream, would be celebrated in history and song; here, amid objects\r\nso grand as to strain conception and stagger belief, they were passed\r\nwithout a halt.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after, the cañon widens and the dominion of the Fire King\r\nbegins. Scattered along both banks of the river are boiling springs\r\nfrom two to twelve feet across, all in active eruption. The craters\r\nof these springs are from three to forty feet high. Like the springs\r\non Gardiner's River, these gradually seal themselves up by depositing\r\nmineral matter around and over their orifices. Numbers of such\r\nself-extinguished craters, now cones of solid rock, are scattered\r\nalong the river-side. Two miles further down the stream is the upper\r\ngeyser-basin, an open, rolling valley, two miles wide and three long,\r\nthe mountains on either side rising 1,500 feet above the valley, with\r\nsteep, heavily-timbered ledges of dark rock.\r\n\r\nHurrying down the Firehole, thinking the wonders of the Yellowstone\r\ncountry had been left behind, and anxious only to reach the settlements\r\nof the Madison Valley, the expedition of 1871 was startled and\r\nastonished to see at no great distance an immense volume of clear,\r\nsparkling water projected into the air to the height of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet. \"Geysers! geysers!\" exclaimed one of the company,\r\nand, spurring their jaded horses, they were soon gathered around an\r\nunexpected phenomenon--a perfect geyser. The aperture through which\r\nthe column of water was projected was an irregular oval, three feet\r\nby seven in diameter. The margin of sinter was curiously piled up,\r\nthe exterior crust filled with little hollows full of water, in which\r\nwere globules of sediment, gathered around bits of wood and other\r\nnuclei This geyser stands on a mound, thirty feet above the level of\r\nthe surrounding plain, its crater rising five or six feet higher. It\r\nspouted at regular intervals nine times during the explorers' stay, the\r\ncolumns of boiling water being thrown from ninety to one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet at each discharge, which lasted from fifteen to twenty\r\nminutes. They gave it the name of \"Old Faithful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Near the crater, and as far as the irruptive waters reach,\" writes\r\nLieutenant Doane, \"the character of the deposit is very peculiar.\r\nClose around the opening are built up walls, eight feet in height, of\r\nspherical nodules, from six inches to three feet in diameter. These\r\nstony spheres, in turn, are covered with minute globules of stalagmite,\r\nincrusted with a thin glazing of silica. The rock, at a distance,\r\nappears the color of ashes of roses, but near at hand shows a metallic\r\ngray, with pink and yellow margins of the utmost delicacy. Being\r\nconstantly wet, the colors are brilliant beyond description. Sloping\r\ngently from this rim of the crater in every direction the rocks are\r\nfull of cavities in successive terraces, forming little pools, with\r\nmargins of silica the color of silver, the cavities being of irregular\r\nshape, constantly full of hot water, and precipitating delicate,\r\ncoral-like beads of a bright saffron. These cavities are also fringed\r\nwith rock around the edges, in meshes as delicate as the finest lace.\r\nDiminutive yellow columns rise from their depths, capped with small\r\ntablets of rock, and resembling flowers growing in the water. Some\r\nof them are filled with oval pebbles of a brilliant white color, and\r\nothers with a yellow frost-work which builds up gradually in solid\r\nstalagmites. Receding still farther from the crater, the cavities\r\nbecome gradually larger, and the water cooler, causing changes in the\r\nbrilliant colorings, and also in the formations of the deposits. These\r\nbecome calcareous spar, of a white or slate color, and occasionally\r\nvariegated. The water of the geyser is colorless, tasteless, and\r\nwithout odor. The deposits are apparently as delicate as the down on\r\nthe butterfly's wing, both in texture and coloring, yet are firm and\r\nsolid beneath the tread. Those who have seen the stage representations\r\nof \"Aladdin's Cave,\" and the \"Home of the Dragon Fly,\" as produced in\r\na first-class theatre, can form an idea of the wonderful coloring, but\r\nnot of the intricate frost-work, of this fairy-like, yet solid mound of\r\nrock, growing up amid clouds of steam and showers of boiling water. One\r\ninstinctively touches the hot ledges with his hands, and sounds with a\r\nstick the depths of the cavities in the slope, in utter doubt in the\r\nevidence of his own eyes. The beauty of the scene takes away one's\r\nbreath. It is overpowering, transcending the visions of the Moslem's\r\nParadise.\"\r\n\r\nAs the next party of explorers were leaving the basin, ascending the\r\nriver, this grand old geyser, which stands sentinel at the head of the\r\nvalley, gave them a magnificent parting display. \"With little or no\r\npreliminary warning,\" writes Dr. Hayden, \"it shot up a column of water\r\nabout six feet in diameter to the height of 100 to 150 feet, and by a\r\nsuccession of impulses seemed to hold it up steadily for the space of\r\nfifteen minutes, the great mass of water falling directly back into the\r\nbasin, and flowing over the edges and down the sides in large streams.\r\nWhen the action ceases, the water recedes beyond sight, and nothing\r\nis heard but the occasional escape of steam until another exhibition\r\noccurs. This is one of the most accommodating geysers in the basin, and\r\nduring our stay played once an hour quite regularly.\"\r\n\r\nOld Faithful stands alone, though surrounded by a number of old\r\ngeyser hills, whether built up in past ages by one spring shifting\r\nits position from time to time, or by a group of springs, now almost\r\nexhausted, it is impossible to tell.\r\n\r\nJust across the river, and close to the margin, stands a silicious\r\ncone, very symmetrical, slightly corrugated on its exterior surface,\r\nthree feet in height and five in diameter at its base. Its orifice is\r\noval, with scalloped edges, and two feet by three in diameter. Of this\r\nunpretending cone Mr. Langford writes:\r\n\r\n\"Not one of our company supposed that it was a geyser; and among so\r\nmany wonders it had almost escaped notice. While we were at breakfast\r\nupon the morning of our departure a column of water, entirely filling\r\nthe crater, shot from it, which, by accurate triangular measurement, we\r\nfound to be 219 feet in height. The stream did not deflect more than\r\nfour or five degrees from a vertical line, and the eruption lasted\r\neighteen minutes. We named it 'The Bee-hive.'\"\r\n\r\nA hundred yards further from the river, near the centre of the large\r\ngroup of spouting and boiling geysers, of which the Bee-hive is one, is\r\na large oval aperture with scalloped edges, the diameters of which were\r\neighteen and twenty-five feet, the sides corrugated and covered with a\r\ngreyish-white silicious deposit, which was distinctly visible at the\r\ndepth of one hundred feet below the surface.\r\n\r\n\"No water could be discovered,\" writes Mr. Langford, on his first\r\napproach to the spring, \"but we could distinctly hear it gurgling\r\nand boiling at a great distance below. Suddenly it began to rise,\r\nboiling and spluttering, and sending out huge masses of steam, causing\r\na general stampede of our company, driving us some distance from our\r\npoint of observation. When within about forty feet of the surface it\r\nbecame stationary, and we returned to look down upon it. It was foaming\r\nand surging at a terrible rate, occasionally emitting small jets of\r\nhot water nearly to the mouth of the orifice. All at once it seemed\r\nseized with a fearful spasm, and rose with incredible rapidity, hardly\r\naffording us time to flee to a safe distance, when it burst from the\r\norifice with terrific momentum, rising in a column the full size of\r\nthis immense aperture to the height of sixty feet; and through and\r\nout of the apex of this vast aqueous mass, five or six lesser jets or\r\nround columns of water, varying in size from six to fifteen inches in\r\ndiameter, were projected to the marvellous height of two hundred and\r\nfifty feet. These lesser jets, so much higher than the main column, and\r\nshooting through it, doubtless proceed from auxiliary pipes leading\r\ninto the principal orifice near the bottom, where the explosive force\r\nis greater.... This grand eruption continued for twenty minutes, and\r\nwas the most magnificent sight we ever witnessed. We were standing on\r\nthe side of the geyser nearest the sun, the gleams of which filled\r\nthe sparkling column of water and spray with myriads of rainbows,\r\nwhose arches were constantly changing,--dipping and fluttering hither\r\nand thither and disappearing only to be succeeded by others, again\r\nand again, amid the aqueous column, while the minute globules into\r\nwhich the spent jets were diffused when falling sparkled like a\r\nshower of diamonds, and around every shadow which the denser clouds\r\nof vapor, interrupting the sun's rays, cast upon the column, could be\r\nseen a luminous circle radiant with all the colors of the prism, and\r\nresembling the halo of glory represented in paintings as encircling the\r\nhead of Divinity. All that we had previously witnessed seemed tame in\r\ncomparison with the perfect grandeur and beauty of this display. Two\r\nof these wonderful eruptions occurred during the twenty-two hours we\r\nremained in the valley. This geyser we named 'The Giantess.'\"\r\n\r\nThe central spring of this group stands on the summit of a great mound\r\nbuilt up in thin layers, by the continual but moderate overflow of the\r\nspring. The crater is twenty feet in diameter, slightly bubbling or\r\nboiling near the centre, and with a thin, elegant ring projecting a few\r\ninches over the water. Looking down into the clear water of this spring\r\none seems to be gazing into fathomless depths, while the bright blue of\r\nthe water is unequalled even by the sea. There are many such central\r\nsprings, usually crowning the summits of mounds, and with projecting\r\nrims carved with an intricate delicacy truly marvellous, and adorned\r\nwith colors that defy description. \"The great beauty of the prismatic\r\ncolors,\" writes Dr. Hayden, \"depends much on the sunlight; about the\r\nmiddle of the day, when the bright rays descend nearly vertically, and\r\na slight breeze just makes a ripple on the surface, the colors exceed\r\ncomparison; when the surface is calm there is one vast chaos of colors,\r\ndancing, as it were, like the colors of a kaleidoscope. As seen through\r\nthis marvellous play of colors, the decorations on the sides of the\r\nbasin are lighted up with a wild, weird beauty, which wafts one at once\r\ninto the land of enchantment; all the brilliant feats of fairies and\r\ngenii in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments are forgotten in the actual\r\npresence of such marvellous beauty; life becomes a privilege and a\r\nblessing after one has seen and thoroughly felt its cunning skill.\"\r\n\r\nAcross the river, and a short distance below this group, is the largest\r\nand most imposing formation in the valley--the crater of Castle Geyser.\r\nThis geyser receives its name from its resemblance to the ruins of\r\nan old castle as one enters the valley from the east. The deposited\r\nsilica has crystallized in immense globular masses, like cauliflowers\r\nor spongiform corals, apparently formed about a nucleus at right\r\nangles to the centre. The entire mound is about forty feet high, and\r\nthe chimney twenty feet. The lower portion rises in steps formed of\r\nthin laminæ of silica, mostly very thin, but sometimes compact, an\r\ninch or two thick. On the southeast side, where the water is thrown\r\nout continually, these steps are ornamented with the usual bead and\r\nshell work, with the large cauliflower-like masses: but the other\r\nportions are fast going to decay, and the débris are abundant. This\r\nhas undoubtedly been one of the most active and powerful geysers in\r\nthe basin; it still keeps up a great roaring inside, and every few\r\nmoments, as observed by Dr. Hayden, it throws out a column of water\r\nto the height of ten or fifteen feet. Occasionally it seems to have\r\nmore imposing eruptions, since on one occasion Lieutenant Doane saw it\r\nthrow a column of water to the height of sixty feet, with the escape\r\nof heavy volumes of steam. The next year Colonel Barlow saw a similar\r\ndisplay. According to the latter observer, the base of the crater is\r\nthree hundred and twenty-five feet in circumference, and the turret\r\none hundred and twenty-five. At the base of the turret lies a large\r\npetrified pine log, covered with a brilliant incrustation several\r\ninches thick.\r\n\r\nAcross the river, and a little below the Castle, are some fifty springs\r\nand geysers, the chief of which has been called Grand Geyser, its\r\npower seeming greater than that of any other in the valley. Lieutenant\r\nDoane describes this magnificent geyser as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Opposite camp, on the other side of the river, is a high ledge of\r\nstalagmite, sloping from the base of the mountain down to the river.\r\nNumerous small knolls are scattered over its surface; the craters of\r\nboiling springs from 15 to 25 feet in diameter; some of these throw\r\nwater to the height of three and four feet. On the summit of this bank\r\nof rock is the grand geyser of the world, a well in the strata, 20 by\r\n25 feet in diametric measurements, (the perceptible elevation of the\r\nrim being but a few inches,) and when quiet having a visible depth of\r\n100 feet. The edge of the basin is bounded by a heavy fringe of rock,\r\nand stalagmite in solid layers is deposited by the overflowing waters.\r\nWhen an eruption is about to occur the basin gradually fills with\r\nboiling water to within a few feet of the surface, then suddenly, with\r\nheavy concussions, immense clouds of steam rise to the height of 500\r\nfeet, and the whole great body of water, 20 by 25 feet, ascends in one\r\ngigantic column to the height of 90 feet; from the apex of this column\r\nfive great jets shoot up, radiating slightly from each other, to the\r\nunparalleled altitude of 250 feet from the ground. The earth trembles\r\nunder the descending deluge from this vast fountain; a thousand hissing\r\nsounds are heard in the air; rainbows encircle the summits of the jets\r\nwith a halo of celestial glory. The falling water plows up and bears\r\naway the shelly strata, and a seething flood pours down the slope\r\nand into the river. It is the grandest, the most majestic, and most\r\nterrible fountain in the world. After playing thus for twenty minutes\r\nit gradually subsides, the water lowers into the crater out of sight,\r\nthe steam ceases to escape, and all is quiet. This grand geyser played\r\nthree times in the afternoon, but appears to be irregular in its\r\nperiods, as we did not see it in eruption again while in the valley.\r\nIts waters are of a deep ultramarine color, clear and beautiful. The\r\nwaving to and fro of the gigantic fountain, in a bright sunlight, when\r\nits jets are at their highest, affords a spectacle of wonder of which\r\nany description can give but a feeble idea. Our whole party were wild\r\nwith enthusiasm; many declared it was 300 feet in height; but I have\r\nkept, in the figures as set down above, within the limits of absolute\r\ncertainty.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAND GEYSER OF THE FIREHOLE BASIN.]\r\n\r\nDr. Hayden describes it with equal enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"We camped the evening of August 5th, in the middle of the Upper Geyser\r\nBasin, in the midst of some of the grandest geysers in the world.\r\nColonel Barlow and Captain Heap, of the United States Engineers, were\r\ncamped on the opposite side of the Firehole. Soon after reaching camp a\r\ntremendous rumbling was heard, shaking the ground in every direction,\r\nand soon a column of steam burst forth from a crater near the edge of\r\nthe east side of the river. Following the steam by a succession of\r\nimpulses, a column of water, apparently six feet in diameter, rose\r\nto the height of 200 feet, while the steam ascended a thousand feet\r\nor more. So steady and uniform did the force act, that the column of\r\nwater appeared to be held there for some minutes, returning into the\r\nbasin in millions of prismatic drops. This was continued for about\r\nfifteen minutes, and the rumbling and confusion attending it could be\r\ncompared only to that of a charge in battle. It would be difficult to\r\ndescribe the intense excitement which attended such a display. It is\r\nprobable that if we could have remained in the valley several days, and\r\nbecome accustomed to all the preliminary warnings, the excitement would\r\nhave ceased, and we could have admired calmly the marvellous ease and\r\nbeauty with which this column of hot water was held up to that great\r\nheight for the space of twenty minutes. After the display is over the\r\nwater settles down in the basin several inches and the temperature\r\nslowly falls to 150°. We called this the Grand Geyser, for its power\r\nseemed greater than any other of which we obtained any knowledge in\r\nthe valley. The are two orifices in one basin; one of them seems to\r\nhave no raised rim, and is a very modest-looking spring in a state of\r\nquiescence, and no one would for a moment suspect the power that was\r\ntemporarily slumbering below. The orifice is oblong, two and a half by\r\nfour feet, while for the space of ten feet in every direction around\r\nit are rounded masses of silica, from a few inches to three feet in\r\ndiameter, looking like spongiform corals. Nothing could exceed the\r\ncrystal clearness of the water. This is the Grand Geyser. Within twenty\r\nfeet of this orifice is a second one, of irregular quadrangular form,\r\nfifteen by twenty-five feet; the east side of the main outer rim of\r\nreservoir extended twenty feet beyond the large orifice. The bottom of\r\nthis great reservoir is covered with thick spongiform masses, and in\r\naddition the rim is most elegantly adorned with countless pearl-like\r\nbeads, of all sizes. There are several beautiful triangular reservoirs,\r\none and one half by three feet, set around the outer sides of the rim,\r\nwith numerous smaller ones, full of clear water, with hundreds of small\r\ndepressions most beautifully scalloped. As we recede from the rim,\r\nthe waters as they pass slowly away produce, by evaporation, broad\r\nshallow basins, with thin, elegantly colored partitions, portions\r\nof which have the form of toad-stools. When the water settles into\r\nthese depressions, or flows away toward the river in numerous small\r\nchannels, the wonderful variety of coloring which is so attractive\r\nto the eye is produced. The larger orifice seems to be in a state\r\nof violent agitation as often as once in twenty minutes, raising up\r\nthe entire mass of water ten or fifteen feet. It is never altogether\r\nquiet. Although these two orifices are within the same rim, I could not\r\nascertain that there is the slightest connection with each other. When\r\nthe large orifice is much agitated it does not disturb the equanimity\r\nof the Grand Geyser. They both operate perfectly independently of each\r\nother. Indeed I do not know that there is a connection between any of\r\nthe springs in the whole basin, though there may be in some rare cases.\r\nThe Grand Geyser operated twice while we were in the basin, with an\r\ninterval of about thirty-two hours; of course the displays could not\r\nbe exactly periodic, but it would be an interesting study to remain\r\nseveral days to watch carefully the movements of such a power.\"\r\n\r\nJust east of Grand Geyser is the Saw-mill, a moderate sized geyser,\r\nwith three smaller ones by the side of it, all playing at the same\r\ntime. From the larger a column of water is constantly shot up fifteen\r\nor twenty feet, with much the sound of the escape of steam from a\r\npipe. The orifice is not more than six inches in diameter; but with\r\nthe three smaller ones playing at the same time a great commotion is\r\nexcited. Near this little group are several large boiling springs,\r\nwhich throw up the water in the centre from two to four feet. These are\r\nfunnel-shaped, with orifices from six inches to two feet in diameter,\r\nin basins with nearly circular rims, from fifteen to forty feet in\r\ndiameter. About one fourth of a mile northeast of the Castle, upon a\r\nmound thirty feet about above the river, built up of thin laminæ of\r\nsilica, and rounded off, rise four chimneys of different sizes, which\r\nare geysers, though perhaps not spouting extensively at present. One\r\nis twelve inches high, nearly circular, and three feet in diameter;\r\nthe second is oblong, four by six feet, with rather coarsely scolloped\r\nmargins, with an aperture about fifteen inches in diameter; the third\r\nchimney is about three feet high and six feet in diameter at the\r\nbase, with an orifice nearly quadrangular twelve inches across. The\r\nspongiform masses inside are covered all over with beautiful pearly\r\nbeads of silica. The fourth chimney rises five feet above the mound,\r\nis ten feet in diameter at the base, with an orifice two feet across,\r\nlined inside with the spongiform masses. This has been at one time a\r\nfirst-class geyser, but is now fast going to decay, a beautiful ruin.\r\nThe elegant bead work on the margin, and all the spongiform masses,\r\nnow are falling into pieces, forming great quantities of _débris_\r\naround the base of the mound. There is also one boiling spring of\r\ngreat beauty. The orifice, which is nearly circular and beautifully\r\nscolloped around the margin, extends straight down, and the water\r\nrises within an inch or two of the margin. The water is in a state\r\nof constant agitation, boiling up two feet at times. The margin has\r\na coating of bright cream-yellow, while all around the surface there\r\nis the most delicate and intricate embroidering, surpassing the most\r\nelaborate lace-work. Surrounding the crater is an outer reservoir four\r\nfeet wide, with a white and reddish-yellow rim, while in the bottom of\r\nthe reservoir is the variegated sediment which aids in giving such a\r\nwonderfully gay appearance to the spring. A stream of water flows from\r\nthe spring to the river, and the channel is lined for fifty yards with\r\nthe variegated sediment. Near this is another mound which rises, with\r\nlaminated steps, about six feet. Dr. Hayden called it the Bathtub. It\r\nhas much the shape and size of an ordinary bathing-tub, five feet by\r\nten, beautifully scolloped around the inner margin with the spongiform\r\nor cauliflower masses of silica, the outer surface being adorned\r\nwith the greatest profusion of pearly beads. The water is constantly\r\nboiling up two feet high, though but a small quantity flows from the\r\nspring. The entire valley is full of similar springs, many of these\r\nno doubt geysers whose periods of activity have never been observed.\r\n\"We could not distinguish,\" writes Lieut. Doane, \"the geysers from the\r\nother hot springs except by seeing them play, and doubtless there are\r\nmany besides in the valley of great size, which we saw when quiet, and\r\nclassed as boiling springs. They all vary in times, force, deposits,\r\nand color of water. The number of springs of all kinds in the valley is\r\nnot less than fifteen hundred; and, with the exception of the Bluestone\r\nSprings, scarcely any two are exactly alike. Taken as an aggregate, the\r\nFirehole Basin surpasses all the other great wonders of the continent.\r\nIt produces an effect on the mind of the beholder utterly staggering\r\nand overpowering. During the night we were several times awakened\r\nby the rush of steam and the hissing of the waters, as the restless\r\ngeysers spouted forth in the darkness. A constant rumbling, as of\r\nmachinery in labor, filled the air, which was damp and warm throughout\r\nthe night.\"\r\n\r\nLieutenant Doane's suspicion that many quiet-looking springs were\r\nslumbering geysers, was speedily and grandly justified. The very\r\nnext morning his company were awakened by a fearful hissing sound,\r\naccompanied by the rush of falling water. On looking out, they saw on\r\nthe other side of the stream a small crater, three feet in height,\r\nwith an opening 26 inches in diameter, which had scarcely been noticed\r\non the previous day. Now it was playing a perpendicular jet to the\r\nheight of 219 feet, amid great clouds of steam, and causing the ground\r\nto tremble as the heavy body of water fell with tremendous splashes\r\nupon the shelly strata below. Huge masses of rock were torn from their\r\nplaces and borne away into the river channel. It played thus, steadily,\r\nfor ten minutes, giving time to obtain an accurate measurement by\r\ntriangulation. This crater gave no notice of being a geyser, and\r\nits appearance and size, compared with others, were altogether\r\ninsignificant. \"We were more than ever convinced,\" adds Lieutenant\r\nDoane, \"that continued observation would develop the knowledge of\r\ngeysers in greater numbers, and perhaps of greater projectile force\r\nthan any we had seen.\"\r\n\r\nCrossing the river once more to the south side--that of Old Faithful\r\nand the Castle--we find another large group of springs, the chief of\r\nwhich is the Giant. This is remarkable rather for its immense flow of\r\nwater than for any peculiarity of structure. It has a rugged crater,\r\nshaped like the base of a broken horn, twelve feet high. Its cavity or\r\nnozzle is seven feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GIANT GEYSER.]\r\n\r\nDuring its quiescent state the boiling water can be seen in its\r\nchambers at a depth of forty feet, the action of the steam and water\r\ntogether producing a loud, rumbling sound. Near, and acting in concert\r\nwith it, are half a dozen smaller craters from two to eight feet in\r\nheight, constantly full of water, and boiling violently from two to\r\nsix feet into the air. \"This great geyser,\" says Lieutenant Doane,\r\n\"played several times while we were in the valley, on one occasion\r\nthrowing constantly for over three hours a stream of water seven feet\r\nin diameter, from 90 to 200 feet perpendicularly. While playing it\r\ndoubled the size of the Firehole River.\"\r\n\r\nAt the base of the mountain further south is a remarkable geyser,\r\ndiscovered by Colonel Barlow, and called by him the Comet.\r\n\r\nThe crater of this geyser is very beautiful, though, being but slightly\r\nelevated above the general slope of the plateau, it might easily\r\nbe overlooked, should it not happen to play during the visit of an\r\nexamining party. There are three openings. One, a very small aperture,\r\nemits puffs of steam, similar to the exhaust-pipe of a steam engine.\r\nThe large one in the centre, six feet across, boils violently during an\r\neruption, but does not throw water to a great height. The third opening\r\nis the geyser proper. It is twelve by eighteen inches in diameter,\r\nsomewhat narrowed as it descends, and is of great depth--smooth\r\nand straight. These cavities are all lined with delicate deposit,\r\nbeautifully enamelled, in appearance as delicate as frost-work, but\r\nhard and strong, requiring the assistance of a hammer to detach\r\nfragments for specimens. Soon after Colonel Barlow entered the basin he\r\nwitnessed a grand eruption of this geyser. He says:\r\n\r\n\"A roar was heard near the hill-side a hundred yards distant, and upon\r\nrushing out in that direction we saw a huge mass of steam issuing from\r\na crater at the base of the hill, accompanied by a column of water\r\nrising to a height far exceeding that of any geyser yet seen. This\r\ngrand fountain continued to play for several minutes, when, having\r\nsubsided, I approached to obtain a closer view of the aperture whence\r\nhad issued such a powerful stream. A sudden gush of steam drove me\r\naway, following which the water was again impelled upward and upward,\r\nfar above the steam, until it seemed to have lost the controlling force\r\nof gravity. The roar was like the sound of a tornado, but there was no\r\napparent effort--a steady stream, very graceful and perfectly vertical,\r\nexcept as a slight breeze may have waved it to and fro. Strong and\r\nsmooth, it continued to ascend, like the stream from a powerful steam\r\nfire-engine. We were all lost in astonishment at the sudden and\r\nmarvellous spectacle. I have no hesitancy in stating that this geyser\r\nplayed to the height of over two hundred feet. It commenced at five\r\no'clock in the afternoon and continued twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n\"The enthusiasm of the party as they watched this wondrous display knew\r\nno bounds. Those who were usually loud and boisterous in the exhibition\r\nof their feelings, became subdued and simply gazed in silent awe;\r\nwhile the more sober members seemed to lose their natural gravity and\r\nmanifested their delight in shouts of rapture. For myself, I remember\r\ntrying to obtain a view of the fountain from all points of the compass\r\nat once, and was brought to a realizing sense of the difficulties\r\nattending the execution of this desire, by discovering that I was\r\nwaiting in the torrent of hot water which was now flooding the nearly\r\nlevel surface of the surrounding rock.\r\n\r\n\"After the grand column of water subsided, vast clouds of steam, were\r\nfor some time ejected from the throat of the geyser, and also from a\r\nsmall rent close beside the main orifice.\r\n\r\n\"During the following day we watched this crater with increasing\r\nvigilance in the hope of witnessing another of its stupendous\r\nexhibitions. The photographer kept his camera levelled upon the spot\r\nall day, and careful arrangements for triangulating the height of the\r\ncolumn were also made. But though numerous indications of another\r\neruption were observed at intervals by the rising of the water with\r\nviolent ebullitions, no explosion occurred till about ten o'clock\r\nat night, when the grand performance was repeated. The spectacle by\r\nmoonlight was truly sublime, but less satisfactory than in the day,\r\nsince it was more difficult to distinguish between the column of water\r\nand the masses of vapor escaping with it. The interval between its\r\neruptions was approximately determined as about twenty-nine hours;\r\nwe therefore reasoned that it would play again at three o'clock the\r\nfollowing night, and at eight on the succeeding morning. But we were\r\ndoomed to disappointment; the eruption persisted in taking-place\r\nbefore daylight on the three succeeding nights, thus preventing the\r\nobservations we so much desired to make.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hundred yards below the Giant is the Grotto so named from the\r\ncurious irregularity of its inclosing walls. It has an exceedingly\r\nintricate formation, with fantastic arches, pillars, and turreted\r\nsides, and discharges several times a day. Several of the first\r\nexplorers crawled through the sinuous apertures when all was quiet.\r\nIt seemed as harmless as curious then, but their opinion was changed\r\nslightly when they saw it an hour after throwing a column of water six\r\nfeet in diameter to the height of sixty feet. Near it are several vents\r\nin which the water boils constantly to the height of six feet, large\r\nstreams running down the banks into the river.\r\n\r\nAround the point of a hill a few hundred yards south of the Grotto, and\r\npartially concealed by a grove of pines, is a white cone twenty-five\r\nfeet high and a hundred feet in diameter at the base. It has evidently\r\nbeen a geyser of considerable importance, but it now merely sends forth\r\npuffs of steam from a small orifice at the top. Near it is a quiet\r\nhot-spring with a most elegantly scalloped rim. Back of this Pyramid is\r\nthe Punch Bowl, and still further south, the Black Sand Geyser, neither\r\nof which has been specially described.\r\n\r\nReturning to the river and crossing we find at the water's edge, nearly\r\nopposite the Grotto, the Riverside Geyser, and a short distance below,\r\non the same side, is the Fan. The latter geyser has a double orifice,\r\nwhich discharges five radiating jets to the height of sixty feet, the\r\nfalling drops and spray giving the appearance of a feather fan. The\r\neffect is very beautiful. Its eruptions are frequent, lasting usually\r\nfrom ten to thirty minutes. A vent connected with it, about forty\r\nfeet distant, expels dense masses of vapor fifty or sixty feet high,\r\naccompanied by loud, sharp reports, during the time the geyser is in\r\naction. Lieutenant Doane describes the curious action of these vents as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"First the steam would rush from the upper crater, roaring violently,\r\nthen this would suddenly cease, to be followed by a fan-like jet of\r\nwater rising from the lower crater to the height of over forty feet,\r\nplaying for perhaps two minutes; then this would suddenly stop flowing,\r\nand the steam would rush forth again for a time. Occasionally the small\r\ncrater threw a transverse stream, alternating with the others; and thus\r\nthey played on for hours, after which all would subside to a gentle\r\nbubbling.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAN GEYSER.]\r\n\r\nAlong both banks of the river are small craters built up in every\r\nconceivable shape. Several streams pour out cascades from round holes\r\nin the rocky bank of the river, and all around are little geysers\r\nplaying at intervals from six to forty feet.\r\n\r\nA plateau opposite the Fan contains fifteen hot springs of various\r\ncharacteristics; some are of a deep blue color and have fantastic\r\ncaverns distinctly visible below the surface of the water. The openings\r\nat the surface are often beautifully edged with delicately wrought\r\nrock fringes. One variety deposits a red or brown leathery substance,\r\npartially adhering to the sides and bottom of the cavern and waving\r\nto and fro like water plants. In size these springs vary from five to\r\nforty feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred yards below the Fan are two lively geysers called the\r\nSentinels. The one on the right bank of the stream is in constant\r\nagitation, its waters revolving horizontally with great violence,\r\noccasionally spouting upward to the height of twenty feet, with a\r\nlateral projection of fifty feet. Much steam is thrown off at each\r\neruption. The crater of this geyser is three feet by ten. The companion\r\nSentinel on the other side of the stream is smaller and less active.\r\nAt this point the river-valley is narrow and the stream rapid, with a\r\nconsiderable fall. Forty or fifty comparatively unimportant geysers and\r\nboiling springs are scattered along the narrow valley to the junction\r\nof Iron Spring Creek, the lower limit of the Upper Geyser Basin.\r\n\r\nIron Spring Creek, a stream about half the size of Firehole River,\r\ntakes its name from a group of springs on its banks, about a mile south\r\nof the Giant. Among the most noticeable of these is a group of eight\r\nbeautiful springs enclosed in a single rim, one hundred and forty feet\r\nin length. The interior of the basin is lined with a rose-colored\r\ndeposit. These springs are situated on the crest of an eminence\r\nincrusted with rocky deposits which encroach on the adjacent forest,\r\nwhose dead and whitened trunks bear evidence of the deadly effect of\r\nthe hot water flowing among them. On a considerable mound, at the\r\njunction of Iron Creek with the main stream, is a group of geysers\r\nthat do not differ materially from those already described. The central\r\nmember of the group is known as Soda Geyser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEE-HIVE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nLOWER GEYSER BASIN.--FIREHOLE RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the Upper and Lower Geyser Basin is a space of two or three\r\nmiles entirely free from hot springs; yet the abundance of spring\r\ndeposit over all the valley shows that the region was once the scene of\r\ngreat thermal activity; the bottom over which the river flows is paved\r\nwith silica. Vegetation grows remarkably rank along the stream, and in\r\nthe valley where the crust of silica does not prevent it, the perpetual\r\nwarmth caused by the proximity to the springs being very favorable to\r\nthe growth of plants. The forest grows close down to the margin of the\r\nriver, making travel very difficult, and in one place the hills of\r\ntrachyte almost close in the valley.\r\n\r\nAt the upper end of the basin--which comprises an area of about thirty\r\nsquare miles--are three large boiling springs, on the west margin of\r\nthe river; nearly opposite are three more, and a short distance below,\r\non the same side, four or five more. Anywhere else these springs would\r\nbe accounted marvels; but they are so eclipsed by a group a few rods\r\nfurther down the stream that we can give them only a passing glance.\r\nThis group includes some of the grandest hot-springs in the world. The\r\nmost formidable is near the margin of the river. Dr. Hayden says:\r\n\r\n\"It seems to have broken out close by the river, and to have\r\ncontinually enlarged its orifice by the breaking down of its sides.\r\nIt evidently commenced on the east side, and the continual wear of\r\nthe under side of the crust on the west side has caused the margin\r\nto fall in, until an aperture at least 250 feet in diameter has been\r\nformed, with walls or sides twenty to thirty feet high, showing the\r\nlaminæ of deposition perfectly. The water is intensely agitated all\r\nthe time, boiling like a caldron, from which a vast column of steam\r\nis ever rising, filling the orifice. As the passing breeze sweeps it\r\naway for a moment, one looks down into this terrible seething pit with\r\nterror. All around the sides are large masses of the silicious crust\r\nthat have fallen from the rim. An immense column of water flows out of\r\nthis caldron into the river. As it pours over the marginal slope, it\r\ndescends by numerous small channels, with a large number of smaller\r\nones spreading over a broad surface, and the marvellous beauty of the\r\nstrikingly vivid coloring far surpasses anything of the kind we have\r\nseen in this land of wondrous beauty--every possible shade of color,\r\nfrom the vivid scarlet to a bright rose, and every shade of yellow to\r\ndelicate cream, mingled with vivid green from minute vegetation. Some\r\nof the channels were lined with a very fine, delicate yellow, silky\r\nmaterial, which vibrates at every movement of the waters. Mr. Thomas\r\nMoran, the distinguished artist, obtained studies of these beautiful\r\nsprings, and from his well-known reputation as a colorist, we look\r\nfor a painting that will convey some conception to the mind of the\r\nexquisite variety of colors around this spring. There was one most\r\nbeautiful funnel-shaped spring, twenty feet in diameter at the top,\r\nbut tapering down, lined inside and outside with the most delicate\r\ndecorations. Indeed, to one looking down into its clear depths, it\r\nseemed like a fairy palace. The same jelly-like substance or pulp to\r\nwhich I have before alluded, covers a large area with the various\r\nshades of light-red and green. The surface yields to the tread like a\r\ncushion. It is about two inches in thickness, and although seldom so\r\ntenacious as to hold together, yet it may be taken up in quite large\r\nmasses, and when it becomes dry it is blown about by the wind like\r\nfragments of variegated lichens.\"\r\n\r\nNear this magnificent spring is a hill of silica with a spring 150 feet\r\nin diameter on its summit. It is known as the Cauldron. The water boils\r\nup in the centre, and overflows with such uniformity on all sides as\r\nto form a succession of ornamental steps, from one to three inches in\r\nheight, just as water would freeze in flowing down a gentle declivity.\r\nIt has the same transparent clearness, the same brilliancy of coloring,\r\nas the spring above described, but the hot steam and the thinness of\r\nthe rim prevented an approach near enough to observe its depth, or\r\nascertain its temperature, except at one edge, where it was 180°. The\r\naverage temperature of twenty of the springs of this group was 184°.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile below this group, on the west side of the river, are four\r\nsmall lakes, with quiet surfaces and water as blue as the sky. One\r\nof them is nearly half a mile in length. Their water is cold at the\r\npresent time, but their basins give indications of their having once\r\nbeen enormous hot springs.\r\n\r\nA mile or so further down the river is a group of a hundred or more\r\nimportant springs besides a countless number of unimportant and dead\r\nsprings, covering a space of nearly a square mile. Only a few of them\r\ncan be specially noticed here. One, on the right bank of the river, is\r\ncalled the Conch Spring, from the resemblance of its basin to a shell,\r\neight feet by ten.\r\n\r\nA little below the Conch Spring, on the very margin of the river, is a\r\nfine geyser, which has built for itself a crater three feet high, with\r\na shell a foot thick. The inside of the crater is about six feet in\r\ndiameter. The water is in constant agitation; sometimes it will boil up\r\nso violently as to throw the entire mass up four feet, and then it will\r\ndie down so as to boil like a caldron. The water is perfectly clear,\r\nand the overflow forms a stream six inches wide and two inches deep,\r\npassing down the sides of the crater and thence into the river along a\r\nmost exquisitely decorated channel. The entire surface of the crater\r\nis covered with pearl-like beads, formed by the spray. A section of\r\nthe crater shows it to have been built up very slowly, in thin laminæ.\r\nAnother spring has a crater like a horn, about a foot in diameter at\r\nthe top and six feet at the base. It is called the Horn Geyser. It is\r\nin constant ebullition, and has the same ornamentations as the one just\r\ndescribed. A spring on a level with the river has an enormous square\r\nbasin, thirty feet across, of unknown depth. It is called the Bath\r\nSpring. A little below is another basin of wonderful beauty, called the\r\nCavern. The water issues from several apertures beneath the crust near\r\nthe margin of the river. The basin itself is fifteen by twenty feet,\r\nand twenty feet deep. Nothing can exceed the transparent clearness of\r\nthe water; the slightest object is reflected in its clear depths, and\r\nthe bright blue tints are indescribable. Mud springs are also numerous\r\nand important in this group. As usual, they are of all sizes, from an\r\ninch or two to twenty or thirty feet in diameter, with contents varying\r\nfrom turbid water to stiff mud. They seldom have any visible outlet,\r\nbut are in constant agitation, with a sound which varies with the\r\nconsistency of the contents; several give off a suppressed thud as the\r\ngases burst their way through the stiff mortar. Sometimes the mortar\r\nis as white as snow; sometimes brown, or tinged with a variety of\r\nvivid colors. One mud spring, located in the woods near a small lake,\r\nnortheast of the Cavern, has a basin thirty by forty feet, with sides\r\nfifteen feet high. It is in constant action, frequently hurling the mud\r\noutside of the rim. All around it are a number of little vents, which\r\nkeep up a simmering noise. Some of these vents have built up little\r\ncones, from four to twelve inches high, many of them sealed at the top.\r\nOn removing the cone, the inside is found to be lined with delicate\r\ncrystals of sulphur, deposited from the steam.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the river, along a little branch that flows in\r\nfrom the west, is a considerable group of geysers and boiling springs.\r\nNear the base of the mountains is a first-class boiling spring with a\r\ncurious fungus-like rim. It is always in violent agitation, sending\r\nforth great columns of steam. It flows from beneath a hill, and is\r\nsurrounded with springs whose silicious deposits take the form of the\r\ntoad-stool fungus. Some of this group may be called spasmodic springs.\r\nOne, with a most beautifully scalloped rim, fifteen by twenty feet\r\nin diameter, is always boiling, and occasionally explodes with great\r\nviolence, shooting its water several feet into the air.\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern side of this Lower Geyser Basin are several extensive\r\nareas abounding in mud-springs, boiling springs and geysers, whose\r\ninfinitely varied characteristics can have no more than the briefest\r\nnotice. Beginning at the north, the first that commands attention is\r\nthat whose central object of interest is the Thud Geyser, so called\r\nfrom the peculiar noise it makes as the water rises and recedes. It\r\nis situated on the slope of a small hill, is about twenty feet in\r\ndiameter, and has a crater five feet wide and five high, composed of\r\ngeyserite of a greyish color, full of deep pockets containing balls\r\nof the same material, about the size of walnuts, each one covered\r\nwith little rosette-like formations. The column of water thrown out\r\nby this geyser during its eruptions is very wide, and reaches the\r\nheight of fifty feet. Near it was obtained some pieces of wood, coated\r\nwith geyserite of a delicate pink tinge: the silica had thoroughly\r\npenetrated the woody fibre. There were found, also, pine-cones coated\r\nin the same manner, forming beautiful specimens. A few yards back of\r\nthe geyser are three large mud-springs, in one of which the mud is red,\r\nin another white, and in the third pink--the jets of steam causing the\r\nmud to assume the form of small conical points throughout the basins.\r\nThey are situated in a bed of clay, the red color being due to iron.\r\nBelow these latter are some chalybeate springs whose bright-red iron\r\ndeposit have spread over a considerable area, in glaring contrast with\r\nthe white color of the silicious deposits of their neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn the same group is a fissure spring forty feet long, four feet wide\r\nand ten deep, clear as crystal; also a large basin nearly circular,\r\nfifty feet in diameter with a number of huge apertures, some of which\r\nthrow up water thirty feet. One orifice shoots a constant stream six\r\nfeet high. All around this geyser-group are smaller springs continually\r\nbubbling, and large numbers of small geysers, some constantly playing\r\nto heights not exceeding ten feet, while others merely keep up a\r\nviolent ebullition, rising and falling with a pulsating motion. There\r\nis also one beautiful quiet spring, with a basin so large that it looks\r\nlike a small lake. Into its clear depths one may look down thirty or\r\nforty feet, beholding a fairy-like palace adorned with more brilliant\r\ncolors than any structure made by human hands. The aggregate waters of\r\nthe group form a little stream which flows westward into the small lake\r\nalready noticed in connection with the mud-springs at the lower end of\r\nthe basin.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Thud Geyser is a large basin 150 feet in diameter,\r\nenclosing a crater twenty-five feet in diameter. From the inner crater\r\nthe water is thrown up in a vast column sixty feet high, falling back\r\nin silver-white globules, a natural fountain of marvellous beauty. A\r\nshort distance south of this Fountain Geyser is the most remarkable\r\nmud-pot in the Firehole valley. Its surface, forty by sixty feet\r\nin diameter, is covered with large puffs, which, in exploding with\r\nsuppressed thuds, throw the hot mud several feet into the air and\r\nspatter the broad rounded rim in every direction. The mud is an\r\nimpalpable silicious clay, of every shade of color from the purest\r\nwhite to a bright pink. Within a few feet of this mud-spring is a\r\nlarge clear spring sixty feet across, with perhaps fifty centres of\r\nebullition. It is filled with the rusty, leathery deposit already\r\ndescribed, and all around the basin where the waters overflow is an\r\nextensive deposit of iron.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a mile east of the mud-springs, at the northwestern base\r\nof a mountain-spur and extending a thousand yards up a ravine, is a\r\ngroup of springs occupying a space five hundred yards wide. One of\r\nthese, the Fissure Spring, is a hundred feet long and from four to\r\nten feet wide. Quite a large stream flows from this spring. Many of\r\nthe surrounding springs remain full to the rim, and are in constant\r\nebullition, yet no water flows from them. Others discharge great\r\nquantities of water. In this group are three sulphur springs, the only\r\nones in the region: the sulphur present however is not very abundant.\r\nSilica and iron seem to be the dominant constituents of nearly all\r\nthe deposits. Some of the springs send forth a disagreeable odor, and\r\ndeposit a curious black sediment like fine gunpowder. Near the centre\r\nof the group is a small lake 600 feet long and 150 wide. By its eastern\r\nshore is a geyser which spouts very regularly to the height of fifteen\r\nor twenty feet. West of the lake are two small geysers cones incrusted\r\nwith a cauliflower-like formation; near them in a fissure are balls of\r\ngeyserite coated in the same manner.\r\n\r\nA thousand yards further south, in the southeastern corner of the\r\nbasin, is a ravine a mile and a half long and three hundred yards wide,\r\noccupied by a most interesting group of springs and geysers. Just below\r\nthe mouth of the ravine, on a mound fifteen feet high, is a large cone\r\ntwenty-five feet high, probably a geyser. Steam issues steadily from\r\nthe top with the sound of a high-pressure engine. It is called the\r\nWhite Dome Geyser.\r\n\r\nIn this lower basin there are very few raised craters, the most of the\r\nsprings and geysers having funnel-shaped basins, with rims of various\r\nforms, but mostly circular. In this group there is besides the White\r\nDome a small cone with its top broken off. It is four feet in diameter,\r\nwith an aperture eighteen inches across. It is called the Bee-hive,\r\nFor several feet around on all sides the surface of the ground is\r\nornamented with pearly tubercles of silica, from the size of a pea to\r\nthree inches in diameter. The spring basins in this group have every\r\nvariety of form. One, a fine boiling spring, has an oval rim five\r\nfeet by eight, its sides running straight down beyond the reach of\r\nvision. Another is funnel-shaped, tapering to a narrow aperture, with a\r\nscalloped rim, projecting several inches over the water. Some springs\r\ndischarge no water; others send forth a stream two feet wide and six\r\ninches deep. In one of the streams, the channel of which is about two\r\nfeet wide and one foot deep, the water is filled with a plant with a\r\npinkish-yellow base, bordered with a very fine green silky fringe,\r\nperpetually vibrating with the flowing waters. \"Except that they were\r\na rich vegetable green, these fringes had the form and texture of the\r\nfinest cashmere wool. The luxuriant growth of vegetation in and along\r\nthe borders of these little streams,\" adds Dr. Hayden, \"was a wonder of\r\nbeauty. The whole view was there superior to anything of the kind I had\r\nseen.\"\r\n\r\nIn some of the springs Dr. Hayden's assistants found butterflies which\r\nhad fallen in and been scalded to death. On taking them out they were\r\nfound to be partially petrified, and coated with silica.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the ravine is the principal geyser of the group.\r\nIts basin is circular and about 60 feet in diameter, although the\r\nspring itself, which is in the centre, is only about 15 or 20 feet in\r\ndiameter. The incrusted margin is full of sinuses, filled with hot\r\nwater, which falls into them whenever the geyser is in operation. These\r\npockets contain also smooth pebbles of geyserite, varying in size from\r\nthat of a pea to a large-sized walnut, rounded by the action of the\r\nwater. The water in the spring of the geyser is of a blue color and in\r\nconstant agitation, though more violently so just before spouting.\r\nThe column of water projected reaches the height of 100 feet, and is\r\naccompanied by immense clouds of steam.\r\n\r\nNot far from this geyser is an elegantly scalloped spring, nearly\r\ncircular, twenty-five feet in diameter, and with vertical sides to an\r\nunknown depth. The entire mass of the water is most violently agitated\r\nat times, and, overflowing the sides of the basin, passes off in\r\nterrace pools or reservoirs to the main stream, producing a system of\r\narchitecture out of silica similar to that of the calcareous springs on\r\nGardiner's River. The gay colors, from bright pink to delicate rose,\r\nare well shown.\r\n\r\nThe valley is filled with springs up to its very source; and springs\r\nwhich burst from the mountain side, eight hundred feet above the level\r\nof the basin, have temperatures ranging from 166° to 180°. Tracing one\r\nexceptionally cool stream up the south side of the cañon, Dr. Hayden\r\nfound on the almost vertical side of the mountain a little spring so\r\nimbedded in bright green moss that it could hardly be seen.\r\n\r\n\"With great difficulty,\" he says, \"we managed to climb up the mountain\r\nside, and, clearing away the moss, obtained the first water that we\r\ncould drink for eight hours. In all of our examination during the day\r\nwe had not found a drop of water of sufficiently low temperature to\r\ntake into our mouths, though there were hundreds of the most beautiful\r\nsprings all around us. We were like Coleridge's mariner in the great\r\nocean, 'Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.'\"\r\n\r\nLooking back over the valley the morning before his departure for\r\nthe Upper Basin, Dr. Hayden saw it literally filled with columns of\r\nsteam, ascending from more than a thousand vents. \"I can compare the\r\nview,\" he writes, \"to nothing but that of some manufacturing city like\r\nPittsburgh, as seen from a high point, except that instead of the black\r\ncoal smoke, there are here the white delicate clouds of steam. Small\r\ngroups or solitary springs that are scattered everywhere in the woods,\r\nupon the mountain-sides, and which would otherwise escape observation,\r\nare detected by the columns of steam. It is evident that some of\r\nthese groups of springs have changed their base of operations within\r\na comparatively recent period; for about midway on the east side of\r\nthe lower basin there is a large area covered with a thick, apparently\r\nmodern, deposit of the silica, as white as snow, while standing quite\r\nthickly all around are dead pines, which appear to have been destroyed\r\nby the excessive overflow of water and the increased deposition. These\r\ndry trees have a most desolate look; many of them have fallen down\r\nand are incrusted with the silica, while portions that have fallen\r\ninto the boiling springs have been reduced to pulp. This seems to be\r\none of the conditions of silicification, for when these pulpy masses\r\nof wood are permitted to dry by the cessation of the springs, the most\r\nperfect specimens of petrified wood are the result. In one instance a\r\ngreen pine-tree had fallen so as to immerse its thick top in a large\r\nhot basin, and leaves, twigs, and cones had become completely incrusted\r\nwith the white silica, and a portion had entered into the cellular\r\nstructure, so that when removed from the water, and dried in the\r\nsun, very fair specimens were obtained. Members of my party obtained\r\nspecimens of pine cones that were sufficiently silicified to be packed\r\naway among the collections.\"\r\n\r\nGrasshoppers, and even butterflies, as we have seen, are occasionally\r\nsubjected to the same treatment, with the same result. By-and-by,\r\nwhen the geyser regions become a popular resort, the preparation of\r\npetrifactions to be carried away as mementos, may become quite an item\r\nof entertainment if not of industry.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a complete view of the Lower Geyser Basin, Colonel Barlow\r\nmade a trip to the summit of the Twin Buttes on the west side of\r\nthe basin. From this point the valley of Firehole River could be\r\noverlooked for a distance of twenty miles; but nothing new was\r\ndiscovered except an attractive fall plunging over a precipice a short\r\ndistance to the south.\r\n\r\nAfter much severe climbing over rocky ridges, and scrambling through\r\ndeep and thickly wooded ravines, he succeeded in reaching the foot of\r\nthe fall--the loveliest vision he had ever beheld. \"Towering above\r\nmy head,\" he writes, \"was a perpendicular cliff, three hundred feet\r\nhigh, while from a slight depression in its upper edge descended a\r\nsparkling stream, dashed into spray as it impinged against projecting\r\nangles of the rocky wall. On reaching the bottom the mist is gathered\r\ninto a shallow basin, forming a pool of clear cold water, delightfully\r\nrefreshing in this region of steaming geysers and volcanic heat. After\r\nresting a moment in this quiet retreat, the water slowly finds its way\r\nthrough the forest, and crossing the geyser valley eventually reaches\r\nFirehole River, some two miles distant.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the marshy ground about the fall the pines shoot upward to an\r\nastonishing altitude, as though ambitious to overtop the cliff. Colonel\r\nBarlow approached the fall through a natural avenue in these pines, and\r\nas he caught sight of its dancing water, leaping with life-like action\r\ndown the face of the overhanging cliff, the thought of fairies was so\r\nstrongly suggested that he could think of no name so appropriate as the\r\nFall of the Fairies.\r\n\r\nThe extreme north of the Lower Basin is bounded by the East Fork of\r\nMadison River, along whose valley, within the basin and above it,\r\nare numerous groups of interesting springs, though not materially\r\ndifferent from those already described. Near the head of the stream\r\nsulphur springs are abundant, with here and there extensive deposits\r\nof sulphur. Steam-vents are frequent, their orifices lined with\r\nsulphur, and the surrounding crust filled with crystals of a vivid\r\nyellow. The channels of the streams are lined with a delicate veil of\r\ncreamy sulphur. In some of the springs, lower down the stream, iron\r\npredominates. Within the basin on the south side of the East Fork are a\r\nhundred springs or more, any one of which, if alone, would be worthy of\r\nelaborate description. In some the fallen leaves of trees are frosted\r\nwith silica as white as snow, and the inner surface of the basins are\r\ncovered with a delicate bead-like embroidery of marvellous beauty. The\r\nmost beautiful of the group is a Prismatic Spring, like those described\r\nin the Upper Basin. \"Nothing ever conceived by human art,\" says Dr.\r\nHayden, \"could equal the peculiar vividness and delicacy of coloring of\r\nthese remarkable prismatic springs.\" About a mile south of the East\r\nFork, at the head of a little stream that flows into the Firehole, is\r\nanother of these brilliant springs. A thin, delicately ornamental rim\r\nof silica surrounds a basin six feet in diameter, filled to the brim\r\nwith water of marvellous transparency. When its surface is rippled by\r\na passing breeze, the reflected sunlight is broken as by a million\r\nprisms. It is called the Rainbow Spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY OF GEYSERS AND OTHER THERMAL SPRINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Icelandic speech the word _geyser_ means simply _rager_, and is\r\napplied indiscriminately to all turbulent fountains of water or mud.\r\nThe most violent and noisy \"rager\" on the island being the great\r\nintermittent spouting spring near Haukadal, it naturally gained for\r\nitself the title, The Geyser; and being the earliest known and most\r\nremarkable fountain of the kind, its native common name was adopted in\r\nother languages as the generic name for all springs of its class.\r\n\r\nThe history of this great, but no longer the greatest geyser, begins\r\nin the early part of the fifteenth century, when its eruptions are\r\nmentioned in Icelandic records. In the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury the Bishop of Skalholt noticed its daily discharges. A hundred\r\nyears later Olafsen and Povelsen described it as having three or four\r\neruptions a day, some of them attaining the height of 300 feet,\r\nincluding, doubtless, the uprush of vapor. The depth of its tube was\r\nthen 72 feet; now it is commonly given as 74, though Commander Forbes,\r\nR. N., claims that it is not so deep by ten feet. In 1774 Von Troil\r\nestimated the height of the ejected column at 92 feet. Seventeen years\r\nlater, Stanley gave 96 feet as its greatest height. Forty yards west\r\nof the Geyser this traveller found a rival, called the Strokr, (in\r\nEnglish, the Churn,) playing to the height of 130 feet. The same year,\r\n1789, an earthquake destroyed the mechanism of the Strokr, converting\r\nit into a quiet reservoir of boiling water, whereupon its name was\r\ntransferred to the present Strokr, which then became especially active\r\nand noisy. In 1804 the Geyser had regained somewhat of its ancient\r\npower, erupting every six hours to the height of 200 feet; and the\r\noriginal Strokr had repaired its tube so that it could lift a column\r\nto nearly the same height and sustain it for a much longer period.\r\nDuring the next five years the power of the Geyser fell off a half,\r\nand its paroxysms became much less frequent--Hooker estimating its\r\ncolumn, in 1809, at 100 feet, and Mackenzie, a year later, at 90 feet,\r\nits eruptions taking place every thirty hours. At the same time the\r\nStrokr played every ten or twelve hours, sixty feet high, for the\r\nspace of thirty minutes. In 1815 the periods had changed again, the\r\nGeyser erupting every six hours, to an average height of 80 feet,--the\r\njets occasionally reaching 150 feet, while the Strokr had prolonged\r\nits quiet intervals to twenty-four hours. Of late years the Geyser's\r\nviolent eruptions seldom occur oftener than once in thirty hours,\r\nand do not exceed 100 feet in altitude, and generally averaging 70\r\nor 80 feet. Between these eruptions are usually two minor spirts,\r\nattaining from 30 to 50 feet. The Strokr is exceedingly irregular in\r\nits operation, and generally requires a dose of turf to bring on an\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\nA grand eruption of the Geyser has been admirably described by\r\nCommander Forbes.\r\n\r\n\"Twice during the night,\" he says, \"I was aroused by the unearthly\r\ncomplaints of _The_ Geyser; but beyond the vast clouds of vapor which\r\ninvariably follow each detonation, and a gentle overflowing of the\r\nbasin, they were false alarms. As morning was breaking it sounded an\r\nunmistakable 'reveille,' which would have roused the dead: and I had\r\nbarely time to take up my position at the brink of the old 'Strokr'\r\nbefore full power was turned on. Jet succeeded jet with fearful\r\nrapidity, earth trembled and the very cone itself seemed to stagger\r\nunder the ordeal. Portions of its sides, rent with the uncontrollable\r\nfury it had suddenly generated, were ripped off and flew up in volleys,\r\nsoaring high above water and steam, whilst the latter rolled away\r\nin fleecy clouds before the light north wind, and catching the rays\r\nof the morning sun just glistening over the Jökul tops in the East,\r\nwas lustrous white as the purest snow. Discharge succeeded discharge\r\nin rapid succession for upwards of four minutes, when, apparently\r\nexhausted and its basin empty, I scrambled up to the margin, intending\r\nto have a good look down the tube, which I imagined must also be\r\nempty; but the water was still within a few feet of the brink, and\r\nboiling furiously. Hastening back to my former position, the basin\r\nfilled rapidly, and I was just in time to witness the most magnificent\r\nexplosion of all. Everything seemed to depend on this superhuman\r\neffort, and a solid, unbroken column of water twenty-five feet in\r\ncircumference, was hurled upwards, attaining an altitude very near 100\r\nfeet. Here the column paused for a moment before reversing its motion,\r\nthen fell listless and exhausted through the volumes which followed\r\nit into its throbbing cup, again to undergo its fiery ordeal at the\r\nthreshold of the infernal regions.\"\r\n\r\nGrand as this display must have been, it was but a momentary spasm,\r\na feeble effort compared with the terrific force which sustains the\r\nGiant's river-volume, with a steady uprush two hundred feet high, for\r\nthe space of three hours and a half. There are many, perhaps scores,\r\nof geysers in the Firehole Basin, which--even in midsummer, when their\r\naction is weakest--far surpass the glory of Iceland.\r\n\r\nBut what is the origin of the power that sustains these wonderful\r\neruptions? And what is the cause of its intermittent action?\r\nFortunately these questions are not only answerable, but the answers\r\nare susceptible of demonstration, as Professor Tyndall has shown in his\r\nadmirable lectures on heat considered as a mode of motion, wherein he\r\ngives the following lucid description of the mechanism and development\r\nof the Great Geyser of Iceland: in principle the description applies\r\nequally to the geysers of Firehole Basin, and all other springs of the\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\"It consists of a tube seventy-four feet deep and ten feet in diameter.\r\nThe tube is surmounted by a basin which measures from north to south\r\nfifty-two feet across, and from east to west sixty feet. The interior\r\nof the tube and basin is coated with a beautiful smooth silicious\r\nplaster, so hard as to resist the blows of a hammer; and the first\r\nquestion is, how was this wonderful tube constructed--how was this\r\nperfect plaster laid on? Chemical analysis shows that the water holds\r\nsilica in solution, and the conjecture might therefore arise that the\r\nwater had deposited the silica against the sides of the tube and\r\nbasin. But this is not the case: the water deposits no sediment; no\r\nmatter how long it may be kept, no solid substance is separated from\r\nit. It may be bottled up and preserved for years as clear as crystal,\r\nwithout showing the slightest tendency to form a precipitate. To answer\r\nthe question in this way would moreover assume that the shaft was\r\nformed by some foreign agency, and that the water merely lined it. The\r\ngeyser basin, however, rests upon the summit of a mound about forty\r\nfeet high, and it is evident from mere inspection that the mound has\r\nbeen deposited by the geyser. But in building up this mound the spring\r\nmust have formed the tube which perforates the mound, and hence the\r\nconclusion that the geyser is the architect of its own tube.\r\n\r\nIf we place a quantity of geyser water in an evaporating basin\r\nthe following takes place: in the centre of the basin the liquid\r\ndeposits nothing, but at the sides where it is drawn up by capillary\r\nattraction, and thus subjected to speedy evaporation, we find silica\r\ndeposited. Round the edge a ring of silica is laid on, and not until\r\nthe evaporation has continued a considerable time do we find the\r\nslightest turbidity in the middle of the water. This experiment is the\r\nmicroscopic representative of what occurs in Iceland. Imagine the\r\ncase of a simple thermal silicious spring, whose waters trickle down\r\na gentle inclosure; the water thus exposed evaporates speedily, and\r\nsilica is deposited. This deposit gradually elevates the side over\r\nwhich the water passes until finally the latter has to take another\r\ncourse. The same takes place here, the ground is elevated as before,\r\nand the spring has to move forward. Thus it is compelled to travel\r\nround and round, discharging its silica and deepening the shaft in\r\nwhich it dwells, until finally, in the course of ages, the simple\r\nspring has produced this wonderful apparatus which has so long puzzled\r\nand astonished both the traveller and the philosopher.\"\r\n\r\nThe time required for the construction of the Great Geyser tube has\r\nbeen estimated by Commander Forbes as ten or eleven centuries, on the\r\nfollowing grounds: a bunch of grass, placed under a little fall made by\r\nthe ejected water, receives, in twenty-four hours, a coating of silica\r\nthe thickness of a thin sheet of paper, or about one five-hundredth\r\npart of an inch. At this rate it would take 1036 years to build up\r\nthe 762 inches, which, according to his measurement, is the depth\r\nof the tube. In evidence of the probable truth of this estimate he\r\nmakes note of the following facts: first, there is no notice of this\r\nfountain in the early history of the colonization of the island 986\r\nyears ago, at which time the tube would have been only three feet deep,\r\nand its eruptions too slight to attract attention; second, 436 years\r\nafterwards, when the tube would have been twenty-six feet deep, and the\r\neruptions proportionately important, the Geyser is mentioned; third,\r\naccurate records of all occurrences were kept by the early inhabitants,\r\nand if so remarkable a phenomenon had existed at the time, it could not\r\nhave been left unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena attending a geyser-eruption--the filling of the basin\r\nwith water, the agitation of the water, with deafening detonations,\r\nthe escape of steam, and so on--have been sufficiently described in\r\nthe preceding chapters. Their causes have been ingeniously explained\r\nby Professor Bunsen, who succeeded in determining the temperature of\r\nthe geyser-tube, throughout its entire length, a few minutes before\r\nan eruption. The annexed diagram shows on the left the observed\r\ntemperatures of the water at different depths, and on the right\r\nthe temperatures at which water would boil, taking into account\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere increased by the presence of the\r\nsuperincumbent column of water. The degrees have been changed from\r\nCentigrade to our familiar Fahrenheit standard, disregarding fractions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in no part of the tube does the water reach\r\nthe boiling point. The nearest approach to it is at A, thirty feet from\r\nthe bottom; out even here the water is some four degrees below the\r\ntemperature at which it could boil. How then is an eruption possible?\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall's explanation is in substance this: Suppose that by\r\nthe entrance of steam from the ducts near the bottom of the tube the\r\ngeyser column is elevated six feet, a height quite within the limits\r\nof actual observation; the water at A is thereby transferred to B.\r\nIts boiling point at A is 255°, and its actual temperature is 251°;\r\nbut at B its boiling point is only 249°, hence when transferred from\r\nA to B, the heat which it possesses is in excess of that necessary\r\nto make it boil. This excess of heat is instantly applied to the\r\ngeneration of steam; the column is thus lifted higher, and the water\r\nbelow is relieved of pressure, and its boiling point lowered. More\r\nsteam is generated; this lifts the column still higher, and compels the\r\ngeneration of more and more steam, until the whole upper portion of the\r\ncolumn bursts into ebullition, and the water, mixed with steam-clouds,\r\nis projected into the atmosphere, and we have the geyser eruption in\r\nall its grandeur.\r\n\r\nOne confirmation of this theory of Bunsen's is that small stones\r\nsuspended in the lower part of the geyser-tube are not thrown out\r\nduring an eruption; and a stronger confirmation lies in the fact that\r\nall the peculiarities of geyser action can be imitated. Professor\r\nTyndall uses for this purpose an apparatus consisting of a tube of iron\r\nsix feet long, surmounted by a basin, and heated by fires underneath.\r\nTo imitate, as far as possible, the conditions of the geyser, he\r\nencircles the tube with a second fire, two feet from the bottom. As the\r\nwater in the tube becomes heated, the phenomena of geyser eruption\r\nare repeated in miniature with beautiful regularity. By stopping the\r\nmouth of the tube with a cork, the enforced explosions of the Strokr\r\nare reproduced; and by similar simple devices the action of all other\r\neruptive springs may be accurately imitated.\r\n\r\nAll through the Firehole Basin and around Yellowstone Lake are many\r\nextinct geysers; sometimes, as in the case of Old Faithful, an active\r\ngeyser is surrounded by a number of deserted cones, the remains of\r\nancient \"roarers.\" What occasions their decline? Earthquakes may, and\r\nno doubt frequently do, derange their mechanism, as observed in the old\r\nStrokr. But most of them probably die a natural death, from old age and\r\ndecrepitude.\r\n\r\n\"A moment's reflection,\" says Professor Tyndall, \"will suggest that\r\nthere must be a limit to the operations of the geyser. When the tube\r\nhas reached such an altitude that the water in the depths below,\r\nowing to the increased pressure, cannot attain its boiling point, the\r\neruptions of necessity cease. The spring, however, continues to deposit\r\nits silica, and often forms a _Laug_, or cistern. Some of these, in\r\nIceland, are forty feet deep. Their beauty, according to Bunsen, is\r\nindescribable. Over the surface curls a light vapor; the water is\r\nof the purest azure, and tints with its lovely hue the fantastic\r\nincrustations on the cistern walls; while at the bottom is often seen\r\nthe mouth of the once mighty geyser. There are in Iceland vast, but\r\nnow extinct geyser operations. Mounds are observed whose shafts are\r\nfilled with rubbish, the water having forced a passage underneath and\r\nretired to other scenes of action. We have, in fact, the geyser in its\r\nyouth, manhood, old age, and death here presented to us. In its youth\r\nas a simple thermal spring; in its manhood, as an eruptive column; in\r\nits old age, as the tranquil _Laug_; while its death is recorded by\r\nthe ruined shaft and mound, which testify the fact of its once active\r\nexistence.\"\r\n\r\nAll that Professor Tyndall describes so eloquently of Iceland,\r\nexists in our Grand National Park in infinitely greater variety, and\r\nmagnitude, and splendor. And much more: Iceland has no Gardiner's\r\nRiver. To find the nearest approach to the marvels of White Mountain\r\nHot Spring, we must go to the opposite side of the globe--to New\r\nZealand. In the celebrated Lake District of the North Island is a\r\nregion of hot springs, far exceeding in extent and variety all the\r\nothers in the world, save those of the Yellowstone. First of all, says\r\nHochstetter, the most marvellous of the Rotomahana marvels is the Te\r\nTarata--the Tattooed Rock--with its terraced marble steps projecting\r\ninto the lake. The spring lies about eighty feet above the lake, on a\r\nfern-clad hill-slope, in a crater-like excavation, with steep reddish\r\nsides, from thirty to forty feet high, and open only toward the lake.\r\nThe basin of the spring is about eighty feet long and sixty wide,\r\nfilled to the brim with perfectly transparent water, which in its\r\nsnow-white basin appears of a beautiful blue, like the blue turquoise.\r\nImmense clouds of steam curl up from the surface, obstructing the view,\r\nbut the noise of boiling and seething is always audible. The water is\r\nslightly salt, but not unpleasant to the taste, chemically neutral,\r\nand possesses petrifying, or rather incrusting qualities, in a high\r\ndegree. The deposit is silicious, like that of the Iceland springs and\r\nthe springs around Yellowstone Lake, not calcareous, like those of\r\nGardiner's River; yet the system of terraces built up by the deposit\r\non the hill-slope has the same appearance of a cataract plunging over\r\na series of natural shelves and suddenly turned to stone. The deposits\r\ncover an area of about three acres, a mere trifle compared with the\r\nsquare miles of similar formations on Gardiner's River and in the\r\nYellowstone Basin.\r\n\r\nIn the same neighborhood is a system of bubbling mud-pools, miniature\r\ncopies of those on the Yellowstone above the falls. The principal\r\ngroup, lying in a ravine nearly a quarter of a mile long, is described\r\nby Dr. Hochstetter as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The entrance to the ravine is overgrown with a thicket and rather\r\ndifficult of access; it also requires considerable caution, as\r\nsuspicious places have to be passed, where the visitor is in danger of\r\nbeing swallowed up in heated mud. Inside, the ravine has the appearance\r\nof a volcanic crater. The bare walls, utterly destitute of vegetation,\r\nare terribly fissured and torn, and odd-looking rocky serratures,\r\nthreatening every moment to break loose, loom up like dismal spectres\r\nfrom red, white and blue fumarole-clay--evidently the last remains of\r\ndecomposed rocks. The bottom of the ravine is of fine mud, scattered\r\nwith blocks of silicious deposit, like cakes of floating ice after a\r\nthaw. Here, a big caldron of mud is simmering; there, lies a deep basin\r\nof boiling water; next to this is a terrible hole, emitting hissing\r\njets of steam, and further on are mud-cones from two to five feet\r\nhigh, vomiting hot mud from their craters with dull rumblings, and\r\nimitating on a small scale the play of large fire volcanoes.\" The gay\r\ncolors of the Yellowstone mud-springs are frequently exhibited in the\r\nvolcanic lake district of New Zealand, and so indeed are most of the\r\nother phenomena we have been studying, though on a far less magnificent\r\nscale. For example, the grandest \"Firehole basin\" on the island\r\noccupies the Shallow valley of a little stream the Waikato, for the\r\ndistance of a mile. It is but a cabinet exhibition comparatively, yet\r\nthe learned geologist of the _Novara_ expedition grows eloquent in his\r\ndescription of it. \"In the morning a dense fog lay upon the Waikato,\r\nbut it soon vanished, the sun shone brightly into the valley, and\r\nnow--what a sight! In its swift course, forming rapids after rapids,\r\nthe Waikato was plunging through the deep valley between steep-rising\r\nmountains; its floods whirling and foaming round two small rocky\r\nislands in the middle of the river, were dashing with a loud uproar\r\nthrough the defile of the valley. Along its banks white clouds of steam\r\nwere ascending from hot cascades falling into the river, and from\r\nbasins full of boiling water shut in by a white mass of stone. Yonder\r\na steaming fountain was rising and falling; now there sprung from\r\nanother place a second fountain; this also ceased in its turn; then two\r\ncommenced playing simultaneously, one quite low at the river bank, the\r\nother opposite on a terrace; and thus the play continued with endless\r\nchanges, as though experiments were being made with grand waterworks,\r\nto see whether the fountains were all in perfect order, and whether\r\nthe waterfalls had a sufficient supply. I began to count the places\r\nwhere a boiling waterbasin was visible, or where a cloud of steam\r\nindicated the existence of one. I counted seventy-six points, without,\r\nhowever, being able to survey the whole region, and among them were\r\nnumerous intermittent geyser-like fountains with periodical eruptions\r\nof water.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT CAÑON AND LOWER FALLS OF THE YELLOWSTONE.]\r\n\r\nThe picture is admirably drawn, but could the artist have done so\r\nwell with the stupendous chasm of the Grand Cañon? or the thousand\r\nvolcanic vents of Firehole Basin with their deafening detonations,\r\ntheir immeasurable evolutions of water and steam? It is possible,\r\nbut scarcely probable. The incomprehensible grandeur of the scene\r\nwould have awed, astounded, bewildered him, and like our Yellowstone\r\nexplorers, he would have despaired of grouping the myriad marvels into\r\none grand effect, and contented himself with setting down a few details\r\nof form and color.\r\n\r\nIn following the exploration of the Yellowstone country and Firehole\r\nBasin, the reader has doubtless observed, in the passage from the quiet\r\nsprings of Gardiner's River to the erupting fountains further on, that\r\nthere is a complete change in the nature of the deposits. The mounds\r\nand terraces built up by the former have for their basis _lime_, those\r\nof the latter _silica_. Dr. Hayden attributes the calcareous deposits\r\nto the deep bed of limestone underlying the springs, but not all\r\nwaters have the power of disolving lime so freely, nor could ordinary\r\nwater take from the trachytic lavas below the silicious springs around\r\nYellowstone Lake and in the Firehole Basin, the silica that appears\r\nso abundantly in their deposits. There must be other forces at work.\r\nWhat are they? \"Both kinds of springs,\" says Dr. Hochstetter, in\r\nhis chapter on New Zealand springs, \"owe their origin to the water\r\npermeating the surface and sinking through fissures into the bowels\r\nof the earth, where it becomes heated by the still existing volcanic\r\nfires. High-pressure steam is thus generated, which, accompanied by\r\nvolcanic gases--such as muriatic acid, sulphurous acid, sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen and carbonic acid--rises again toward the colder surface and\r\nis there condensed into hot water. The overheated steam and the gases\r\ndecompose the rock beneath, dissolving certain ingredients which are\r\ndeposited on the surface. According to Bunsen's ingenious observations,\r\na chronological succession takes place in the coöperation of the gases.\r\nThe sulphurous acid acts first. It is generated where rising sulphur\r\nvapor comes in contact with glowing masses of rock. Wherever vapors of\r\nsulphurous acid are constantly formed, there acid-springs or solfataras\r\narise. Incrustations of alum are very common in such places, arising\r\nfrom the action of sulphuric acid on the alumina and alkali of the\r\nlavas; another product of the decomposition of the lavas is gypsum,\r\nor sulphate of lime, the residuum being a more or less ferruginous\r\nfumarole clay, the material of the mud-pools. After the sulphurous\r\nacid comes sulphuretted hydrogen, produced by the action of steam on\r\nsulphids; and by the mutual decomposition of sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nand sulphurous acid sulphur is formed, the characteristic precipitate\r\nin all solfataras, while the deposition of silica is either entirely\r\nwanting or quite inconsiderable, and the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nis but rarely noticed. These acid springs have no periodical outbursts\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nIn course of time the source of sulphurous acid becomes exhausted, and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen alone remains active. The acid reaction of the\r\nsoil disappears, yielding to an alkaline reaction by the formation of\r\nsulphids. At the same time carbonic acid begins to act upon the rocks,\r\nand the alkaline bi-carbonates thus produced dissolve the silica, which\r\non the evaporation of the water is deposited in the form of opal or\r\nquartz or silicious earth, and thus the shell of the springs is formed,\r\non the structure of which the periodicity of the outburst depends....\r\nThe deposition of silica in quantities sufficient for the formation\r\nof this spring-apparatus in the course of years, takes place only in\r\nthe alkaline springs. Their water is either neutral or has a slightly\r\nalkaline reaction. Silica, common salt, carbonates and sulphates are\r\nthe chief ingredients dissolved in it. In the place of sulphurous\r\nacid the odor of sulphuretted hydrogen is sometimes observed in these\r\nsprings.... By the gradual cooling of the volcanic rocks under the\r\nsurface of the earth the hot springs themselves gradually die out,\r\nfor they too are but a transient phenomenon in the eternal change of\r\ncreated things.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMR. EVERTS'S THIRTY-SEVEN DAYS OF PERIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day that I found myself separated from the company, and for\r\nseveral days previous, our course had been impeded by the dense growth\r\nof pine forest, and occasional large tracts of fallen timber frequently\r\nrendering our progress almost impossible. Whenever we came to one of\r\nthese immense windfalls, each man engaged in the pursuit of a passage\r\nthrough it, and it was while thus employed, and with the idea that I\r\nhad found one, that I strayed out of sight and hearing of my comrades.\r\nWe had had a toilsome day. It was quite late in the afternoon. As\r\nseparations like these had frequently occurred, it gave me no alarm,\r\nand I rode on, fully confident of soon rejoining the company, or of\r\nfinding their camp. I came up with the pack-horse, which Mr. Langford\r\nafterwards recovered, and tried to drive him along. But failing to\r\ndo so, and my eyesight being defective, I spurred forward, intending\r\nto return with assistance from the party. This incident tended to\r\naccelerate my speed. I rode on in the direction which I supposed had\r\nbeen taken, until darkness overtook me in the dense forest. This was\r\ndisagreeable enough, but caused me no alarm. I had no doubt of being\r\nwith the party at breakfast the next morning. I selected a spot for\r\ncomfortable repose, picketed my horse, built a fire, and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I rose at early dawn, saddled and mounted my horse,\r\nand took my course in the supposed direction of the camp. Our ride of\r\nthe previous day had been up a peninsula jutting into the lake, for the\r\nshore of which I started, with the expectation of finding my friends\r\ncamped on the beach. The forest was quite dark, and the trees so thick,\r\nthat it was only by a slow process I could get through them at all.\r\nIn searching for the trail I became somewhat confused. The falling\r\nfoliage of the pines had obliterated every trace of travel. I was\r\nobliged frequently to dismount, and examine the ground for the faintest\r\nindications. Coming to an opening, from which I could see several\r\nvistas, I dismounted for the purpose of selecting one leading in the\r\ndirection I had chosen, and leaving my horse unhitched, as had always\r\nbeen my custom, walked a few rods into the forest. While surveying\r\nthe ground my horse took fright, and I turned around in time to see\r\nhim disappearing at full speed among the trees. That was the last I\r\never saw of him. It was yet quite dark. My blankets, gun, pistols,\r\nfishing-tackle, matches--everything, except the clothing on my person,\r\na couple of knives, and a small opera-glass were attached to the saddle.\r\n\r\nI did not yet realize the possibility of a permanent separation from\r\nthe company. Instead of following up the pursuit of their camp, I\r\nengaged in an effort to recover my horse. Half a day's search convinced\r\nme of its impracticability. I wrote and posted in an open space several\r\nnotices, which, if my friends should chance to see, would inform them\r\nof my condition and the route I had taken, and then struck out into\r\nthe forest in the supposed direction of their camp. As the day wore on\r\nwithout any discovery, alarm took the place of anxiety at the prospect\r\nof another night alone in the wilderness, and this time without food\r\nor fire. But even this dismal foreboding was cheered by the hope that\r\nI should soon rejoin my companions, who would laugh at my adventure,\r\nand incorporate it as a thrilling episode into the journal of our\r\ntrip. The bright side of a misfortune, as I found by experience, even\r\nunder the worst possible circumstances, always presents some features\r\nof encouragement. When I began to realize that my condition was one\r\nof actual peril, I banished from my mind all fear of an unfavorable\r\nresult. Seating myself on a log, I recalled every foot of the way I had\r\ntravelled since the separation from my friends, and the most probable\r\nopinion I could form of their whereabouts was, that they had, by a\r\ncourse but little different from mine, passed by the spot where I had\r\nposted the notices, learned of my disaster, and were waiting for me\r\nto rejoin them there, or searching for me in that vicinity. A night\r\nmust be spent amid the prostrate trunks before my return could be\r\naccomplished. At no time during my period of exile did I experience so\r\nmuch mental suffering from the cravings of hunger as when, exhausted\r\nwith this long day of fruitless search, I resigned myself to a couch\r\nof pine foliage in the pitchy darkness of a thicket of small trees.\r\nNaturally timid in the night, I fully realized the exposure of my\r\ncondition. I peered upward through the darkness, but all was blackness\r\nand gloom. The wind sighed mournfully through the pines. The forest\r\nseemed alive with the screeching of night birds, the angry barking of\r\ncoyotes, and the prolonged, dismal howl of the gray wolf. These sounds,\r\nfamiliar by their constant occurrence throughout the journey, were now\r\nfull of terror, and drove slumber from my eye-lids, but above all\r\nthis, however, was the hope that I should be restored to my comrades\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning I rose unrefreshed, and pursued my weary way\r\nover the prostrate trunks. It was noon when I reached the spot where\r\nmy notices were posted. No one had been there. My disappointment was\r\nalmost overwhelming. For the first time, I realized that I was lost.\r\nThen came a crushing sense of destitution. No food, no fire; no means\r\nto procure either; alone in an unexplored wilderness, one hundred and\r\nfifty miles from the nearest human abode, surrounded by wild beasts,\r\nand famishing with hunger. It was no time for despondency. A moment\r\nafterwards I felt how calamity can elevate the mind, in the formation\r\nof the resolution \"not to perish in that wilderness.\"\r\n\r\nThe hope of finding the party still controlled my plans. I thought,\r\nby traversing the peninsula centrally, I would be enabled to strike\r\nthe shore of the lake in advance of their camp, and near the point of\r\ndeparture for the Madison. Acting upon this impression, I rose from\r\na sleepless couch, and pursued my way through the timber-entangled\r\nforest. A feeling of weakness took the place of hunger. Conscious of\r\nthe need of food, I felt no cravings. Occasionally, while scrambling\r\nover logs and through thickets, a sense of faintness and exhaustion\r\nwould come over me, but I would suppress it with the audible\r\nexpression, \"This won't do; I _must_ find my company.\" Despondency\r\nwould sometimes strive with resolution for the mastery of my thoughts.\r\nI would think of home--of my daughter--and of the possible chance of\r\nstarvation, or death in some more terrible form; but as often as these\r\ngloomy forebodings came, I would strive to banish them with reflections\r\nbetter adapted to my immediate necessities. I recollect at this time\r\ndiscussing the question, whether there was not implanted by Providence\r\nin every man a principle of self-preservation equal to any emergency\r\nwhich did not destroy his reason. I decided this question affirmatively\r\na thousand times afterwards in my wanderings, and I record this\r\nexperience here, that any person who reads it, should he ever find\r\nhimself in like circumstances, may not despair. There is life in the\r\nthought. It will revive hope, allay hunger, renew energy, encourage\r\nperseverance, and, as I have proved in my own case, bring a man out of\r\ndifficulty, when nothing else can avail.\r\n\r\nIt was mid-day when I emerged from the forest into an open space at\r\nthe foot of the peninsula. A broad lake of beautiful curvature, with\r\nmagnificent surroundings, lay before me, glittering in the sunbeams.\r\nIt was full twelve miles in circumference. A wide belt of sand formed\r\nthe margin which I was approaching, directly opposite to which, rising\r\nseemingly from the very depths of the water, towered the loftiest peak\r\nof a range of mountains apparently interminable. The ascending vapor\r\nfrom innumerable hot springs, and the sparkling jet of a single geyser\r\nadded the feature of novelty to one of the grandest landscapes I ever\r\nbeheld. Nor was the life of the scene less noticeable than its other\r\nattractions. Large flocks of swans and other waterfowl were sporting\r\non the quiet surface of the lake; otters in great numbers performed\r\nthe most amusing aquatic evolutions; mink and beaver swam around\r\nunscared, in most grotesque confusion. Deer, elk, and mountain sheep\r\nstared at me, manifesting more surprise than fear at my presence among\r\nthem. The adjacent forest was vocal with the songs of birds, chief of\r\nwhich were the chattering notes of a species of mocking-bird, whose\r\nimitative efforts afforded abundant merriment. Seen under favorable\r\ncircumstances, this assemblage of grandeur, beauty, and novelty would\r\nhave been transporting; but jaded with travel, famishing with hunger,\r\nand distressed with anxiety, I was in no humor for ecstasy. My tastes\r\nwere subdued and chastened by the perils which environed me. I longed\r\nfor food, friends, and protection. Associated with my thoughts,\r\nhowever, was the wish that some of my friends of peculiar tastes could\r\nenjoy this display of secluded magnificence, now, probably, for the\r\nfirst time beheld by mortal eyes.\r\n\r\nThe lake was at least one thousand feet lower than the highest point of\r\nthe peninsula, and several hundred feet below the level of Yellowstone\r\nLake. I recognized the mountain which overshadowed it as the landmark\r\nwhich, a few days before, had received from General Washburn the\r\nname of Mount Everts; and as it is associated with some of the most\r\nagreeable and terrible incidents of my exile, I feel that I have more\r\nthan a mere discoverer's right to the perpetuity of that christening.\r\nThe lake is fed by innumerable small streams from the mountains, and\r\nthe countless hot springs surrounding it. A large river flows from\r\nit, through a cañon a thousand feet in height, in a southeasterly\r\ndirection, to a distant range of mountains, which I conjectured to be\r\nSnake River; and with the belief that I had discovered the source of\r\nthe great southern tributary of the Columbia, I gave it the name of\r\nBessie Lake, after the\r\n\r\n  \"Sole daughter of my house and heart.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the first two days, the fear of meeting with Indians gave me\r\nconsiderable anxiety; but, when conscious of being lost, there was\r\nnothing I so much desired as to fall in with a lodge of Bannocks or\r\nCrows. Having nothing to tempt their cupidity, they would do me no\r\npersonal harm, and, with the promise of reward, would probably minister\r\nto my wants and aid my deliverance. Imagine my delight, while gazing\r\nupon the animated expanse of water, at seeing sail out from a distant\r\npoint a large canoe containing a single oarsman. It was rapidly\r\napproaching the shore where I was seated. With hurried steps I paced\r\nthe beach to meet it, all my energies stimulated by the assurance it\r\ngave of food, safety, and restoration to friends. As I drew near to\r\nit it turned towards the shore, and oh! bitter disappointment, the\r\nobject which my eager fancy had transformed into an angel of relief\r\nstalked from the water, an enormous pelican, flapped its dragonwings\r\nas if in mockery of my sorrow, and flew to a solitary point farther up\r\nthe lake. This little incident quite unmanned me. The transition from\r\njoy to grief brought with it a terrible consciousness of the horrors\r\nof my condition. But night was fast approaching, and darkness would\r\ncome with it. While looking for a spot where I might repose in safety,\r\nmy attention was attracted to a small green plant of so lively a hue\r\nas to form a striking contrast with the deep pine foliage. For closer\r\nexamination I pulled it up by the root, which was long and tapering,\r\nnot unlike a radish. It was a thistle. I tasted it; it was palatable\r\nand nutritious. My appetite craved it, and the first meal in four\r\ndays was made on thistle-roots. Eureka! I had found food. No optical\r\nillusion deceived me this time; I could subsist until I rejoined my\r\ncompanions. Glorious counterpoise to the wretchedness of the preceding\r\nhalf-hour!\r\n\r\nOverjoyed at this discovery, with hunger allayed, I stretched myself\r\nunder a tree, upon the foliage which had partially filled a space\r\nbetween contiguous trunks, and fell asleep. How long I slept I know\r\nnot; but suddenly I was roused by a loud, shrill scream, like that of\r\na human being in distress, poured, seemingly, into the very portals of\r\nmy ear. There was no mistaking that fearful voice. I had been deceived\r\nby and answered it a dozen times while threading the forest, with the\r\nbelief that it was a friendly signal. It was the screech of a mountain\r\nlion, so alarmingly near as to cause every nerve to thrill with\r\nterror. To yell in return, seize with convulsive grasp the limbs of\r\nthe friendly tree, and swing myself into it, was the work of a moment.\r\nScrambling hurriedly from limb to limb, I was soon as near the top as\r\nsafety would permit. The savage beast was snuffing and growling below,\r\napparently on the very spot I had just abandoned. I answered every\r\ngrowl with a responsive scream. Terrified at the delay and pawing of\r\nthe beast, I increased my voice to its utmost volume, broke branches\r\nfrom the limbs, and, in the impotency of fright, madly hurled them at\r\nthe spot whence the continued howlings proceeded.\r\n\r\nFailing to alarm the animal, which now began to make the circuit of\r\nthe tree, as if to select a spot for springing into it, I shook, with\r\na strength increased by terror, the slender trunk until every limb\r\nrustled with the motion. All in vain. The terrible creature pursued\r\nhis walk around the tree, lashing the ground with his tail, and\r\nprolonging his howlings almost to a roar. It was too dark to see, but\r\nthe movements of the lion kept me apprised of its position. Whenever I\r\nheard it on one side of the tree I speedily changed to the opposite--an\r\nexercise which, in my weakened state, I could only have performed\r\nunder the impulse of terror. I would alternately sweat and thrill with\r\nhorror at the thought of being torn to pieces and devoured by this\r\nformidable monster. All my attempts to frighten it seemed unavailing.\r\nDisheartened at its persistency, and expecting every moment it would\r\ntake the deadly leap, I tried to collect my thoughts, and prepare for\r\nthe fatal encounter which I knew must result. Just at this moment it\r\noccurred to me that I would try silence. Clasping the trunk of the tree\r\nwith both arms, I sat perfectly still. The lion, at this time ranging\r\nround, occasionally snuffing and pausing, and all the while filling the\r\nforest with the echo of his howlings, suddenly imitated my example.\r\nThis silence was more terrible, if possible, than the clatter and crash\r\nof his movements through the brushwood, for now I did not know from\r\nwhat direction to expect his attack. Moments passed with me like hours.\r\nAfter a lapse of time which I cannot estimate, the beast gave a spring\r\ninto the thicket and ran screaming into the forest. My deliverance was\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nHad strength permitted, I should have retained my perch till daylight,\r\nbut with the consciousness of escape from the jaws of the ferocious\r\nbrute came a sense of overpowering weakness which almost palsied\r\nme, and made my descent from the tree both difficult and dangerous.\r\nIncredible as it may seem, I lay down in my old bed, and was soon lost\r\nin a slumber so profound that I did not awake until after daylight.\r\nThe experience of the night seemed like a terrible dream; but the\r\nbroken limbs which in the agony of consternation I had thrown from\r\nthe tree, and the rifts made in the fallen foliage by my visitant in\r\nhis circumambulations, were too convincing evidences of its reality.\r\nI could not dwell upon my exposure and escape without shuddering and\r\nreflecting that probably like perils would often occur under less\r\nfortunate circumstances, and with a more fatal issue. I wondered what\r\nfate was in reserve for me--whether I would ultimately sink from\r\nexhaustion and perish of starvation, or become the prey of some of\r\nthe ferocious animals that roamed these vast fastnesses. My thoughts\r\nthen turned to the loved ones at home. They could never know my fate,\r\nand would indulge a thousand conjectures concerning it, not the least\r\ndistressing of which would be that I had been captured by a band of\r\nhostile Sioux, and tortured to death at the stake.\r\n\r\nI was roused from this train of reflections by a marked change in the\r\natmosphere. One of those dreary storms of mingled snow and rain, common\r\nto these high latitudes, set in. My clothing, which had been much torn,\r\nexposed my person to its \"pitiless peltings.\" An easterly wind, rising\r\nto a gale, admonished me that it would be furious and of long duration.\r\nNone of the discouragements I had met with dissipated the hope of\r\nrejoicing my friends; but foreseeing the delay, now unavoidable, I knew\r\nthat my escape from the wilderness must be accomplished, if at all,\r\nby my own unaided exertions. This thought was terribly afflicting,\r\nand brought before me, in vivid array, all the dreadful realities of\r\nmy condition. I could see no ray of hope. In this condition of mind I\r\ncould find no better shelter than the spreading branches of a spruce\r\ntree, under which, covered with earth and boughs, I lay during the two\r\nsucceeding days; the storm, meanwhile, raging with unabated violence.\r\nWhile thus exposed, and suffering from cold and hunger, a little\r\nbenumbed bird, not larger than a snow-bird, hopped within my reach. I\r\ninstantly seized and killed it, and, plucking its feathers, ate it raw.\r\nIt was a delicious meal for a half-starved man.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of a lull in the elements, on the morning of the\r\nthird day I rose early and started in the direction of a large group\r\nof hot springs which were steaming under the shadow of Mount Everts.\r\nThe distance I travelled could not have been less than ten miles.\r\nLong before I reached the wonderful cluster of natural caldrons, the\r\nstorm had recommenced. Chilled through, with my clothing thoroughly\r\nsaturated, I lay down under a tree upon the heated incrustation until\r\ncompletely warmed. My heels and the sides of my feet were frozen. As\r\nsoon as warmth had permeated my system, and I had quieted my appetite\r\nwith a few thistle-roots, I took a survey of my surroundings, and\r\nselected a spot between two springs sufficiently asunder to afford heat\r\nat my head and feet. On this spot I built a bower of pine branches,\r\nspread its incrusted surface with fallen foliage and small boughs,\r\nand stowed myself away to await the close of the storm. Thistles were\r\nabundant, and I had fed upon them long enough to realize that they\r\nwould, for a while at least, sustain life. In convenient proximity\r\nto my abode was a small, round, boiling spring, which I called my\r\ndinner-pot, and in which, from time to time, I cooked my roots.\r\n\r\nThis establishment, the best I could improvise with the means at hand,\r\nI occupied seven days--the first three of which were darkened by one of\r\nthe most furious storms I ever saw. The vapor which supplied me with\r\nwarmth saturated my clothing with its condensations. I was enveloped\r\nin a perpetual steam bath. At first this was barely preferable to the\r\nstorm, but I soon became accustomed to it, and before I left, though\r\nthoroughly parboiled, actually enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nI had little else to do during my imprisonment but cook, think,\r\nand sleep. Of the variety and strangeness of my reflections it is\r\nimpossible to give the faintest conception. Much of my time was given\r\nto devising means for escape. I recollected to have read, at the time\r\nof their publication, the narratives of Lieutenant Strain and Doctor\r\nKane, and derived courage and hope from the reflection that they\r\nstruggled with and survived perils not unlike those which environed\r\nme. The chilling thought would then occur, that they were not alone.\r\nThey had companions in suffering and sympathy. Each could bear his\r\nshare of the burden of misery which it fell to my lot to bear alone,\r\nand make it lighter from the encouragement of mutual counsel and aid\r\nin a cause of common suffering. Selfish as the thought may seem,\r\nthere was nothing I so much desired as a companion in misfortune. How\r\ngreatly it would alleviate my distress! What a relief it would be to\r\ncompare my wretchedness with that of a brother sufferer, and with him\r\ndevise expedients for every exigency as it occurred! I confess to the\r\nweakness, if it be one, of having squandered much pity upon myself\r\nduring the time I had little else to do.\r\n\r\nNothing gave me more concern than the want of fire. I recalled\r\neverything I had ever read or heard of the means by which fire could\r\nbe produced; but none of them were within my reach. An escape without\r\nit was simply impossible. It was indispensable as a protection against\r\nnight attacks from wild beasts. Exposure to another storm like the one\r\njust over would destroy my life, as this one would have done, but for\r\nthe warmth derived from the springs. As I lay in my bower anxiously\r\nawaiting the disappearance of the snow, which had fallen to the depth\r\nof a foot or more, and impressed with the belief that for want of fire\r\nI should be obliged to remain among the springs, it occurred to me\r\nthat I would erect some sort of monument, which might, at some future\r\nday, inform a casual visitor of the circumstances under which I had\r\nperished. A gleam of sunshine lit up the bosom of the lake, and with\r\nit the thought flashed upon my mind that I could, with a lens from my\r\nopera-glasses, get fire from Heaven. Oh, happy, life-renewing thought!\r\nInstantly subjecting it to the test of experiment, when I saw the smoke\r\ncurl from the bit of dry wood in my fingers, I felt, if the whole world\r\nwere offered me for it, I would cast it all aside before parting with\r\nthat little spark. I was now the happy possessor of food and fire.\r\nThese would carry me through. All thoughts of failure were instantly\r\nabandoned. Though the food was barely adequate to my necessities--a\r\nfact too painfully attested by my attenuated body--I had forgotten the\r\ncravings of hunger, and had the means of producing fire. I said to\r\nmyself, \"I will not despair.\"\r\n\r\nMy stay at the springs was prolonged several days by an accident\r\nthat befell me on the third night after my arrival there. An unlucky\r\nmovement while asleep broke the crust on which I reposed, and the hot\r\nsteam, pouring upon my hip, scalded it severely before I could escape.\r\nThis new affliction, added to my frost-bitten feet, already festering,\r\nwas the cause of frequent delay and unceasing pain through all my\r\nwanderings. After obtaining fire, I set to work making preparations for\r\nas early departure as my condition would permit. I had lost both knives\r\nsince parting from the company, but I now made a convenient substitute\r\nby sharpening the tongue of a buckle which I cut from my vest. With\r\nthis I cut the legs and counters from my boots, making of them a\r\npassable pair of slippers, which I fastened to my feet as firmly as I\r\ncould with strips of bark. With the ravellings of a linen handkerchief,\r\naided by the magic buckle-tongue, I mended my clothing. Of the same\r\nmaterial I made a fish-line, which, on finding a piece of red tape in\r\none of my pockets better suited to the purpose, I abandoned as a \"bad\r\njob.\" I made of a pin that I found in my coat a fish-hook, and, by\r\nsewing up the bottoms of my boot-legs, constructed a very good pair of\r\npouches to carry my food in, fastening them to my belt by the straps.\r\n\r\nThus accountered, on the morning of the eighth day after my arrival\r\nat the springs I bade them a final farewell, and started on my course\r\ndirectly across that portion of the neck of the peninsula between\r\nme and the southeast arm of Yellowstone Lake. It was a beautiful\r\nmorning. The sun shone bright and warm, and there was a freshness\r\nin the atmosphere truly exhilarating. As I wandered musingly along,\r\nthe consciousness of being alone, and having surrendered all hope of\r\nfinding my friends, returned upon me with crushing power. I felt, too,\r\nthat those friends, by the necessities of their condition, had been\r\ncompelled to abandon all efforts for my recovery. The thought was full\r\nof bitterness and sorrow. I tried to realize what their conjectures\r\nwere concerning my disappearance; but could derive no consolation\r\nfrom the long and dismal train of circumstances they suggested.\r\nWeakened by a long fast, and the unsatisfying nature of the only food\r\nI could procure, I know that from this time onward to the day of my\r\nrescue, my mind, though unimpaired in those perceptions needful to\r\nself-preservation, was in a condition to receive impressions akin to\r\ninsanity. I was constantly travelling in dream-land, and indulging in\r\nstrange reveries such as I had never before known. I seemed to possess\r\na sort of duality of being, which, while constantly reminding me of the\r\nnecessities of my condition, fed my imagination with vagaries of the\r\nmost extravagant character. Nevertheless I was perfectly conscious of\r\nthe tendency of these morbid influences, and often tried to shake them\r\noff, but they would ever return with increased force, and I finally\r\nreasoned myself into the belief that their indulgence, as it afforded\r\nme pleasure, could work no harm while it did not interfere with my\r\nplans for deliverance. Thus I lived in a world of ideal happiness, and\r\nin a world of positive suffering at the same time.\r\n\r\nA change in the wind and an overcast sky, accompanied by cold, brought\r\nwith them a need of warmth. I drew out my lens and touchwood, but alas!\r\nthere was no sun. I sat down on a log to await his friendly appearance.\r\nHours passed; he did not come. Night, cold freezing night, set in, and\r\nfound me exposed to all its terrors. A bleak hill-side sparsely covered\r\nwith pines afforded poor accommodations for a half-clad, famishing man.\r\nI could only keep from freezing by the most active exertion in walking,\r\nrubbing, and striking my benumbed feet and hands against the logs. It\r\nseemed the longest, most terrible night of my life, and glad was I\r\nwhen the approaching dawn enabled me to commence retracing my steps to\r\nBessie Lake. I arrived there at noon, built my first fire on the beach,\r\nand remained by it, recuperating for the succeeding two days.\r\n\r\nThe faint hope that my friends might be delayed by their search for\r\nme until I could rejoin them now forsook me altogether. I made my\r\narrangements independent of it. Either of three directions I might take\r\nwould effect my escape, if life and strength held out. I drew upon the\r\nsand of the beach a map of these several courses with reference to my\r\nstarting-point from the lake, and considered well the difficulties each\r\nwould present. All were sufficiently defined to avoid mistake. One was\r\nto follow Snake River a distance of one hundred miles or more to Eagle\r\nRock bridge; another, to cross the country between the southern shore\r\nof Yellowstone Lake and the Madison Mountains, by scaling which I could\r\neasily reach the settlements in the Madison Valley; and the other,\r\nto retrace my journey over the long and discouraging route by which\r\nI had entered the country. Of these routes the last mentioned seemed\r\nthe least inviting, probably because I had so recently traversed it,\r\nand was familiar with its difficulties. I had heard and read so much\r\nconcerning the desolation and elemental upheavals and violent waters\r\nof the upper valley of the Snake, that I dared not attempt to return\r\nin that direction. The route by the Madison Range, encumbered by the\r\nsingle obstruction of the mountain barrier, was much the shortest, and\r\nso most unwisely, as will hereafter appear, I adopted it.\r\n\r\nFilling my pouches with thistle-roots, I took a parting survey of the\r\nlittle solitude that had afforded me food and fire the preceding ten\r\ndays, and with something of that melancholy feeling experienced by\r\none who leaves his home to grapple with untried adventures, started\r\nfor the nearest point on Yellowstone Lake. All that day I travelled\r\nover timber-heaps, amid tree tops, and through thickets. At noon I\r\ntook the precaution to obtain fire. With a brand which I kept alive by\r\nfrequent blowing, and constant waving to and fro, at a late hour in the\r\nafternoon, faint and exhausted, I kindled a fire for the night on the\r\nonly vacant spot I could find amid a dense wilderness of pines. The\r\ndeep gloom of the forest, in the spectral light which revealed on all\r\nsides of me a compact and unending growth of trunks and an impervious\r\ncanopy of sombre foliage; the shrieking of night-birds; the super\r\nnaturally human scream of the mountain lion, the prolonged howl of the\r\nwolf, made me insensible to all other forms of suffering.\r\n\r\nThe burn on my hip was so inflamed that I could only sleep in a sitting\r\nposture. Seated with my back against a tree, the smoke from the fire\r\nalmost enveloping me in its suffocating folds, I vainly tried, amid the\r\ndin and uproar of this horrible serenade, to woo the drowsy god. My\r\nimagination was instinct with terror. At one moment it seemed as if, in\r\nthe density of a thicket, I could see the blazing eyes of a formidable\r\nforest monster fixed upon me, preparatory to a deadly leap; at another\r\nI fancied that I heard the swift approach of a pack of yelping wolves\r\nthrough the distant brushwood, which in a few moments would tear me\r\nlimb from limb. Whenever, by fatigue and weakness, my terrors yielded\r\nto drowsiness, the least noise roused me to a sense of the hideousness\r\nof my condition. Once, in a fitful slumber, I fell forward into the\r\nfire, and inflicted a wretched burn on my hand. Oh! with what agony I\r\nlonged for day!\r\n\r\nA bright and glorious morning succeeded the dismal night, and brought\r\nwith it the conviction that I had been the victim of uncontrollable\r\nnervous excitement. I resolved henceforth to banish it altogether,\r\nand, in much better spirits than I anticipated, resumed my journey\r\ntowards the lake. Another day of unceasing toil among the tree-tops\r\nand thickets overtook me, near sunset, standing upon a lofty headland\r\njutting into the lake, and commanding a magnificent prospect of the\r\nmountains and valley over an immense area. In front of me, at a\r\ndistance of fifty miles away, in the clear blue of the horizon, rose\r\nthe arrowy peaks of the Three Tetons. On the right, and apparently in\r\nclose proximity to the eminence I occupied, rolled the picturesque\r\nrange of the Madison, scarred with clefts, ravines, gorges, and cañons,\r\neach of which glittered in the sunlight or deepened in shadow as the\r\nfitful rays of the descending luminary glanced along their varied rocky\r\nirregularities. Above where I stood were the lofty domes of Mounts\r\nLangford and Doane, marking the limits of that wonderful barrier which\r\nhad so long defied human power in its efforts to subdue it. Rising\r\nseemingly from the promontory which favored my vision was the familiar\r\nsummit of Mount Everts, at the base of which I had dwelt so long, and\r\nwhich still seemed to hold me within its friendly shadow. All the vast\r\ncountry within this grand enclosure of mountains and lake, scarred\r\nand seamed with the grotesque ridges, rocky escarpments, undulating\r\nhillocks, and miniature lakes, and steaming with hot springs, produced\r\nby the volcanic forces of a former era, lay spread out before me like a\r\nvast panorama.\r\n\r\nI doubt if distress and suffering can ever entirely obliterate all\r\nsense of natural grandeur and magnificence. Lost in the wonder and\r\nadmiration inspired by this vast world of beauties, I nearly forgot\r\nto improve the few moments of remaining sunshine to obtain fire. With\r\na lighted brand in my hand, I effected a most difficult and arduous\r\ndescent of the abrupt and stony headland to the beach of the lake.\r\nThe sand was soft and yielding. I kindled a fire, and removing the\r\nstiffened slippers from my feet, attached them to my belt, and wandered\r\nbarefoot along the sandy shore to gather wood for the night. The dry,\r\nwarm sand was most grateful to my lacerated and festering feet, and for\r\na long time after my wood-pile was supplied, I sat with them uncovered.\r\nAt length, conscious of the need of every possible protection from the\r\nfreezing night atmosphere, I sought my belt for the slippers, and one\r\nwas missing. In gathering the wood it had become detached and was lost.\r\nDarkness was closing over the landscape, when, sorely disheartened with\r\nthe thought of passing the night with one foot exposed to a freezing\r\ntemperature, I commenced a search for the missing slipper. I knew I\r\ncould not travel a day without it. Fearful that it had dropped into\r\nthe lake, and been carried by some recurrent wave beyond recovery, my\r\nsearch for an hour among fallen trees and bushes, up the hill-side and\r\nalong the beach, in darkness and with flaming brands, at one moment\r\ncrawling on hands and feet into a brush-heap, another peering among\r\nlogs and bushes and stones, was filled with anxiety and dismay. Success\r\nat length rewarded my perseverance, and no language can describe the\r\njoy with which I drew the cause of so much distress from beneath the\r\nlimb that, as I passed, had torn it from my belt. With a feeling of\r\ngreat relief I now sat down in the sand, my back to a log, and listened\r\nto the dash and roar of the waves. It was a wild lullaby, but had no\r\nterrors for a worn-out man. I never passed a night of more refreshing\r\nsleep. When I awoke my fire was extinguished save a few embers, which\r\nI soon fanned into a cheerful flame. I ate breakfast with some relish,\r\nand started along the beach in pursuit of a camp, believing that if\r\nsuccessful I should find directions what to do, and food to sustain me.\r\nThe search which I was making lay in the direction of my pre-arranged\r\nroute to the Madison Mountains, which I intended to approach at their\r\nlowest point of altitude.\r\n\r\nBuoyed by the hope of finding food and counsel, and another night of\r\nundisturbed repose in the sand, I resumed my journey along the shore,\r\nand at noon found the camp last occupied by my friends on the lake.\r\nI struck their trail in the sand some time before I came to it. A\r\nthorough search for food in the ground and trees revealed nothing,\r\nand no notice to apprise me of their movements could be seen. A\r\ndinner-fork, which afterwards proved to be of infinite service in\r\ndigging roots, and a yeast-powder can, which would hold half a pint,\r\nand which I converted into a drinking-cup and dinner-pot, were the only\r\nevidences that the spot had ever been visited by civilized man. \"Oh!\"\r\nthought I, \"why did they forget to leave me food!\" It never occurred to\r\nme that they might have cached it, as I have since learned they did,\r\nin several spots nearer the place of my separation from them. I left\r\nthe camp in deep dejection, with the purpose of following the trail of\r\nthe party to the Madison. Carefully inspecting the faint traces left of\r\ntheir course of travel, I became satisfied that from some cause they\r\nhad made a retrograde movement from this camp, and departed from the\r\nlake at a point farther down stream. Taking this as an indication that\r\nthere were obstructions above, I commenced retracing my steps along\r\nthe beach. An hour of sunshine in the afternoon enabled me to procure\r\nfire, which, in the usual manner, I carried to my camping-place. There\r\nI built a fire, and to protect myself from the wind, which was blowing\r\nviolently, lashing the lake into foam, I made a bower of pine boughs,\r\ncrept under it, and very soon fell asleep. How long I slept I know\r\nnot, but I was aroused by the snapping and cracking of the burning\r\nfoliage, to find my shelter and the adjacent forest in a broad sheet\r\nof flame. My left hand was badly burned, and my hair singed closer\r\nthan a barber would have trimmed it, while making my escape from the\r\nsemicircle of burning trees. Among the disasters of this fire, there\r\nwas none I felt more seriously than the loss of my buckle-tongue knife,\r\nmy pin fish-hook, and tape fish-line.\r\n\r\nThe grandeur of the burning forest surpasses description. An immense\r\nsheet of flame, following to their tops the lofty trees of an\r\nalmost impenetrable pine forest, leaping madly from top to top, and\r\nsending thousands of forked tongues a hundred feet or more athwart\r\nthe midnight darkness, lighting up with lurid gloom and glare the\r\nsurrounding scenery of lake and mountains, fills the beholder with\r\nmingled feelings of awe and astonishment. I never before saw anything\r\nso terribly beautiful. It was marvellous to witness the flash-like\r\nrapidity with which the flames would mount the loftiest trees. The\r\nroaring, cracking, crashing, and snapping of falling limbs and burning\r\nfoliage was deafening. On, on, on travelled the destructive element,\r\nuntil it seemed as if the whole forest was enveloped in flame. Afar\r\nup the wood-crowned hill, the overtopping trees shot forth pinnacles\r\nand walls and streamers of arrowy fire. The entire hill-side was an\r\nocean of glowing and surging fiery billows. Favored by the gale, the\r\nconflagration spread with lightning swiftness over an illimitable\r\nextent of country, filling the atmosphere with driving clouds of\r\nsuffocating fume, and leaving a broad and blackened trail of spectral\r\ntrunks shorn of limbs and foliage, smoking and burning, to mark the\r\nimmense sweep of its devastation.\r\n\r\nResolved to search for a trail no longer, when daylight came I selected\r\nfor a landmark the lowest notch in the Madison Range. Carefully\r\nsurveying the jagged and broken surface over which I must travel to\r\nreach it, I left the lake and pushed into the midst of its intricacies.\r\nAll the day, until nearly sunset, I struggled over rugged hills,\r\nthrough windfalls, thickets, and matted forests, with the rock-ribbed\r\nbeacon constantly in view. As I advanced it receded, as if in mockery\r\nof my toil. Night overtook me with my journey half accomplished. The\r\nprecaution of obtaining fire gave me warmth and sleep, and long before\r\ndaylight I was on my way. The hope of finding an easy pass into the\r\nvalley of the Madison inspired me with fresh courage and determination;\r\nbut long before I arrived at the base of the range, I scanned\r\nhopelessly its insurmountable difficulties. It presented to my eager\r\nvision an endless succession of inaccessible peaks and precipices,\r\nrising thousands of feet sheer and bare above the plain. No friendly\r\ngorge or gully or cañon invited such an effort as I could make to scale\r\nthis rocky barrier. Oh for the faith that could remove mountains! How\r\nsoon should this colossal fabric open at my approach! What a feeling\r\nof helpless despair came over me with the conviction that the journey\r\nof the last two days had been in vain! I seated myself on a rock upon\r\nthe summit of a commanding hill, and cast my eyes along the only route\r\nwhich now seemed tenable--down the Yellowstone. How many dreary miles\r\nof forest and mountain filled the terrible panorama! I thought that\r\nbefore accepting this discouraging alternative I would spend a day in\r\nsearch for a pass. Twenty miles at most would take me into the Madison\r\nValley, and thirty more restore me to friends who had abundance.\r\nSupposing that I should find plenty of thistles, I had left the lake\r\nwith a small supply, and that was entirely spent. I looked in vain for\r\nthem where I then was.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus considering whether to remain and search for a passage\r\nor return to the Yellowstone, I experienced one of those strange\r\nhallucinations which many of my friends have misnamed insanity,\r\nbut which to me was Providence. An old clerical friend, for whose\r\ncharacter and counsel I had always cherished peculiar regard, in some\r\nunaccountable manner seemed to be standing before me, charged with\r\nadvice which would relieve my perplexity. I seemed to hear him say, as\r\nif in a voice and with the manner of authority:\r\n\r\n\"Go back immediately, as rapidly as your strength will permit. There is\r\nno food here, and the idea of scaling these rocks is madness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" I rejoined, \"the distance is too great. I cannot live to\r\ntravel it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say not so. Your life depends upon the effort. Return at once.\r\nStart now, lest your resolution falter. Travel as fast and as far as\r\npossible--it is your only chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, I am rejoiced to meet you in this hour of distress, but doubt\r\nthe wisdom of your counsel. I am within seventy miles of Virginia. Just\r\nover these rocks, a few miles away, I shall find friends. My shoes are\r\nnearly worn out, my clothes are in tatters, and my strength is almost\r\novercome. As a last trial, it seems to me I can but attempt to scale\r\nthis mountain or perish in the effort, if God so wills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't think of it. Your power of endurance will carry you through. I\r\nwill accompany you. Put your trust in Heaven. Help yourself and God\r\nwill help you.\"\r\n\r\nOvercome by these and other persuasions, and delighted with the idea\r\nof having a travelling companion, I plodded my way over the route I\r\nhad come, intending at a certain point to change it so as to strike\r\nthe river at the foot of the lake. Stopping after a few miles of\r\ntravel, I had no difficulty in procuring fire, and passed a comfortable\r\nnight. When I resumed my journey the next day the sun was just rising.\r\nWhenever I was disposed, as was often the case, to question the wisdom\r\nof the change of routes, my old friend appeared to be near with words\r\nof encouragement, but his reticence on other subjects both surprised\r\nand annoyed me. I was impressed at times, during the entire journey,\r\nwith the belief that my return was a fatal error, and if my deliverance\r\nhad failed should have perished with that conviction. Early this day\r\nI deflected from my old route and took my course for the foot of the\r\nlake, with the hope, by constant travel, to reach it the next day. The\r\ndistance was greater than I anticipated. Nothing is more deceptive\r\nthan distance in these high latitudes. At the close of each of the two\r\nsucceeding days, my point of destination was seemingly as far from me\r\nas at the moment I took leave of the Madison Range, and when, cold\r\nand hungry, on the afternoon of the fourth day, I gathered the first\r\nfood I had eaten in nearly five days, and lay down by my fire near the\r\ndebouchure of the river, I had nearly abandoned all hope of escape.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak I was on the trail down the river. The thought I had\r\nadopted from the first, \"I will cot perish in this wilderness,\" often\r\nrevived my sinking spirits, when, from faintness and exhaustion, I felt\r\nbut little desire for life. Once, while struggling through a field of\r\ntangled trunks which seemed interminable, at one of the pauses I found\r\nmyself seriously considering whether it was not preferable to die there\r\nthan renew the effort to proceed. I felt that all attempt to escape\r\nwas but a bitter prolongation of the agony of dissolution. A seeming\r\nwhisper in the air, \"While there is life there is hope; take courage,\"\r\nbroke the delusion, and I clambered on. I did not forget to improve\r\nthe mid-day sun to procure fire. Sparks from the lighted brands had\r\nburned my hands and crisped the nails of my fingers, and the smoke from\r\nthem had tanned my face to the complexion of an Indian. While passing\r\nthrough an opening in the forest I found the tip of a gull's wing; it\r\nwas fresh. I made a fire upon the spot, mashed the bones with a stone,\r\nand consigning them to my camp kettle, the yeast-powder box, made half\r\na pint of delicious broth. The remainder of that day and the night\r\nensuing were given to sleep.\r\n\r\nI lost all sense of time. Days and nights came and went, and were\r\nnumbered only by the growing consciousness that I was gradually\r\nstarving. I felt no hunger, did not eat to appease appetite, but to\r\nrenew strength. I experienced but little pain. The gaping sores on my\r\nfeet, the severe burn on my hip, the festering crevices at the joints\r\nof my fingers, all terrible in appearance, had ceased to give me the\r\nleast concern. The roots which supplied my food had suspended the\r\ndigestive power of the stomach, and their fibres were packed in it in a\r\nmatted, compact mass.\r\n\r\nNot so with my hours of slumber. They were visited by the most\r\nluxurious dreams. I would apparently visit the most gorgeously\r\ndecorated restaurants of New York and Washington; sit down to immense\r\ntables spread with the most appetizing viands; partake of the richest\r\noyster stews and plumpest pies; engage myself in the labor and\r\npreparation of curious dishes, and with them fill range upon range\r\nof elegantly furnished tables until they fairly groaned beneath\r\nthe accumulated dainties prepared by my own hands. Frequently the\r\nentire night would seem to have been spent in getting up a sumptuous\r\ndinner. I would realize the fatigue of roasting, boiling, baking, and\r\nfabricating the choicest dishes known to the modern _cuisine_, and in\r\nmy disturbed slumbers would enjoy with epicurean relish the food thus\r\nfurnished even to repletion. Alas! there was more luxury than life in\r\nthese somnolent vagaries.\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, gloomy day when I arrived in the vicinity of the falls.\r\nThe sky was overcast and the snow-capped peaks rose chilly and bleak\r\nthrough the biting atmosphere. The moaning of the wind through the\r\npines, mingling with the sullen roar of the falls, was strangely in\r\nunison with my own saddened feelings. I had no heart to gaze upon a\r\nscene which a few weeks before had inspired me with rapture and awe.\r\nOne moment of sunshine was of more value to me than all the marvels\r\namid which I was famishing. But the sun had hid his face and denied me\r\nall hope of obtaining fire. The only alternative was to seek shelter\r\nin a thicket. I penetrated the forest a long distance before finding\r\none that suited me. Breaking and crowding my way into its very midst, I\r\ncleared a spot large enough to recline upon, interlaced the surrounding\r\nbrushwood, gathered the fallen foliage into a bed, and lay down with a\r\nprayer for sleep and forgetfulness. Alas! neither came. The coldness\r\nincreased through the night. Constant friction with my hands and\r\nunceasing beating with my legs and feet saved me from freezing. It was\r\nthe most terrible night of my journey, and when, with the early dawn, I\r\npulled myself into a standing posture, it was to realize that my right\r\narm was partially paralyzed, and my limbs so stiffened with cold as to\r\nbe almost immovable. Fearing lest paralysis should suddenly seize upon\r\nthe entire system, I literally dragged myself through the forest to\r\nthe river. Seated near the verge of the great cañon below the falls,\r\nI anxiously awaited the appearance of the sun. That great luminary\r\nnever looked so beautiful as when, a few moments afterwards, he emerged\r\nfrom the clouds and exposed his glowing beams to the concentrating\r\npowers of my lens. I kindled a mighty flame, fed it with every dry\r\nstick and broken tree-top I could find, and without motion, and almost\r\nwithout sense, remained beside it several hours. The great falls of\r\nthe Yellowstone were roaring within three hundred yards, and the awful\r\ncañon yawned almost at my feet; but they had lost all charm for me. In\r\nfact, I regarded them as enemies which had lured me to destruction, and\r\nfelt a sullen satisfaction in morbid indifference.\r\n\r\nMy old friend and adviser, whose presence I had felt more than seen\r\nthe last few days, now forsook me altogether. But I was not alone.\r\nBy some process which I was too weak to solve, my arms, legs, and\r\nstomach were transformed into so many travelling companions. Often\r\nfor hours I would plod along conversing with these imaginary friends.\r\nEach had his peculiar wants which he expected me to supply. The\r\nstomach was importunate in his demand for a change of diet--complained\r\nincessantly of the roots I fed him, their present effect and more\r\nremote consequences. I would try to silence him with promises, beg of\r\nhim to wait a few days, and when this failed of the quiet I desired,\r\nI would seek to intimidate him by declaring, as a sure result of\r\nnegligence, our inability to reach home alive. All to no purpose--he\r\ntormented me with his fretful humors through the entire journey. The\r\nothers would generally concur with him in these fancied altercations.\r\nThe legs implored me for rest, and the arms complained that I gave them\r\ntoo much to do. Troublesome as they were, it was a pleasure to realize\r\ntheir presence. I worked for them, too, with right good will, doing\r\nmany things for their seeming comfort which, had I felt myself alone,\r\nwould have remained undone. They appeared to be perfectly helpless\r\nof themselves; would do nothing for me or for each other. I often\r\nwondered, while they ate and slept so much, that they did not aid\r\nin gathering wood and kindling fires. As a counterpoise to their own\r\ninertia, whenever they discovered languor in me on necessary occasions,\r\nthey were not wanting in words of encouragement and cheer. I recall\r\nas I write, an instance where, by prompt and timely interposition,\r\nthe representative of the stomach saved me from a death of dreadful\r\nagony. One day I came to a small stream issuing from a spring of mild\r\ntemperature on the hill-side, swarming with minnows. I caught some\r\nwith my hands, and ate them raw. To my taste they were delicious. But\r\nthe stomach refused them, accused me of attempting to poison him, and\r\nwould not be reconciled until I had emptied my pouch of the few fish\r\nI had put there for future use. Those that I ate made me very sick.\r\nPoisoned by the mineral in the water, had I glutted my appetite with\r\nthem as I intended, I should doubtless have died in the wilderness, in\r\nexcruciating torment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMAGINARY COMPANIONS.]\r\n\r\nA gradual mental introversion grew upon me as physical weakness\r\nincreased. The grand and massive scenery which, on the upward journey,\r\nhad aroused every enthusiastic impulse of my nature, was now tame and\r\nspiritless. My thoughts were turned in upon myself--upon the dreadful\r\nfate which apparently lay just before me--and the possible happiness\r\nof the existence beyond. All doubt of immortality fled in the light of\r\npresent realities. So vivid were my conceptions of the future that at\r\ntimes I longed for death, not less as the beginning of happiness than\r\nas a release from misery. Led on by these reflections, I would recall\r\nthe varied incidents of my journey--my escape from the lion, from fire,\r\nmy return from the Madison Range--and in all of them I saw how much I\r\nhad been indebted to that mysterious protection which comes only from\r\nthe throne of the Eternal. And yet, starving, foot-sore, half blind,\r\nworn to a skeleton, was it surprising that I lacked the faith needful\r\nto buoy me above the dark waters of despair, which I now felt were\r\nclosing around me?\r\n\r\nIn less serious moods, as I struggled along, my thoughts would revert\r\nto the single being on whom my holiest affections centred--my daughter.\r\nWhat a tie was that to bind me to life! Oh! could I be restored to her\r\nfor a single hour, long enough for parting counsel and blessing, it\r\nwould be joy unspeakable! Long hours of painful travel were relieved\r\nof physical suffering by this absorbing agony of the mind, which, when\r\nfrom my present standpoint I contrast it with the personal calamities\r\nof my exile, swells into mountains.\r\n\r\nTo return from this digression. At many of the streams on my route I\r\nspent hours in endeavoring to catch trout, with a hook fashioned from\r\nthe rim of my broken spectacles, but in no instance with success. The\r\ntackle was defective. The country was full of game in great variety. I\r\nsaw large herds of deer, elk, antelope, occasionally a bear, and many\r\nsmaller animals. Numerous flocks of ducks, geese, swans, and pelicans\r\ninhabited the lakes and rivers. But with no means of killing them,\r\ntheir presence was a perpetual aggravation. At all the camps of our\r\ncompany I stopped and recalled many pleasant incidents associated with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, when approaching \"Tower Falls,\" I came upon a large\r\nhollow tree, which, from the numerous tracks surrounding it, and the\r\nmatted foliage in the cavity, I recognized as the den of a bear. It\r\nwas a most inviting couch. Gathering a needful supply of wood and\r\nbrush, I lighted a circle of piles around the tree, crawled into the\r\nnest, and passed a night of unbroken slumber. I rose the next morning\r\nto find that during the night the fires had communicated with the\r\nadjacent forest, and burned a large space in all directions, doubtless\r\nintimidating the rightful proprietor of the nest, and saving me from\r\nanother midnight adventure.\r\n\r\nAt \"Tower Falls\" I spent the first half of a day in capturing a\r\ngrasshopper, and the remainder in a fruitless effort to catch a mess\r\nof trout. In the agony of disappointment, I resolved to fish no more.\r\nA spirit of rebellion seized me. I determined that thistles should\r\nthenceforth be my only sustenance. \"Why is it,\" I asked of myself,\r\n\"that in the midst of abundance, every hour meeting with objects which\r\nwould restore strength and vigor and energy, every moment contriving\r\nsome device to procure the nourishment my wasting frame required, I\r\nshould meet with these repeated and discouraging failures?\" Thoughts\r\nof the early teaching of a pious mother suppressed these feelings.\r\nOh! how often have the recollections of a loved New England home, and\r\nthe memories of a happy childhood, cheered my sinking spirits, and\r\ndissipated the gathering gloom of despair! There were thoughts and\r\nfeelings and mental anguishes without number, that visited me during my\r\nperiod of trial, that never can be known to any but my God and myself.\r\nBitter as was my experience, it was not unrelieved by some of the most\r\nprecious moments I have ever known.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving \"Tower Falls,\" I entered the open country. Pine\r\nforests and windfalls were changed for sage brush and desolation, with\r\noccasional tracts of stunted verdure, barren hillsides, exhibiting\r\nhere and there an isolated clamp of dwarf trees, and ravines filled\r\nwith the rocky _debris_ of adjacent mountains. My first camp on this\r\npart of the route, for the convenience of getting wood, was made near\r\nthe summit of a range of towering foot-hills. Towards morning a storm\r\nof wind and snow nearly extinguished my fire. I became very cold; the\r\nstorm was still raging when I arose, and the ground white with snow. I\r\nwas perfectly bewildered, and had lost my course of travel. No visible\r\nobject, seen through the almost blinding storm, reassured me, and there\r\nwas no alternative but to find the river and take my direction from its\r\ncurrent. Fortunately, after a few hours of stumbling and scrambling\r\namong rocks and over crests, I came to the precipitous side of the\r\ncañon through which it ran, and with much labor, both of hands and\r\nfeet, descended it to the margin. I drank copiously of its pure waters,\r\nand sat beside it for a long time, waiting for the storm to abate,\r\nso that I could procure fire. The day wore on, without any prospect\r\nof a termination to the storm. Chilled through, my tattered clothing\r\nsaturated, I saw before me a night of horrors unless I returned to\r\nmy fire. The scramble up the side of the rocky cañon, in many places\r\nnearly perpendicular, was the hardest work of my journey. Often,\r\nwhile clinging to the jutting rocks with hands and feet, to reach a\r\nshelving projection, my grasp would unclose and I would slide many feet\r\ndown the sharp declivity. It was night when, sore from the bruises I\r\nhad received, I reached my fire; the storm, still raging, had nearly\r\nextinguished it. I found a few embers in the ashes, and with much\r\ndifficulty kindled a flame. Here, on this bleak mountain side, as well\r\nas I now remember, I must have passed two nights beside the fire, in\r\nthe storm. Many times during each night I crawled to the little clump\r\nof trees to gather wood, and brush, and the broken limbs of fallen\r\ntree-tops. All the sleep I obtained was snatched from the intervals\r\nwhich divided these labors. It was so harassed with frightful dreams as\r\nto afford little rest. I remember, before I left this camp, stripping\r\nup my sleeves to look at my shrunken arms. Flesh and blood had\r\napparently left them. The skin clung to the bones like wet parchment.\r\nA child's hand could have clasped them from wrist to shoulder. \"Yet,\"\r\nthought I, \"it is death to remain; I cannot perish in this wilderness.\"\r\n\r\nTaking counsel of this early formed resolution, I hobbled on my course\r\nthrough the snow, which was rapidly disappearing before the rays of\r\nthe warm sun. Well knowing that I should find no thistles in the\r\nopen country, I had filled my pouches with them before leaving the\r\nforest. My supply was running low, and there were yet several days\r\nof heavy mountain travel between me and Botelers' Ranch. With the\r\nmost careful economy, it could last but two or three days longer. I\r\nsaw the necessity of placing myself and imaginary companions upon\r\nallowance. The conflict which ensued with the stomach, when I announced\r\nthis resolution, required great firmness to carry through. I tried\r\nwheedling and coaxing and promising; failing in these, I threatened to\r\npart company with a comrade so unreasonable, and he made no further\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nTwo or three days before I was found, while ascending a steep hill, I\r\nfell from exhaustion into the sage brush, without the power to rise.\r\nUnbuckling my belt, as was my custom, I soon fell asleep. I have\r\nno idea of the time I slept, but upon awaking I fastened my belt,\r\nscrambled to my feet, and pursued my journey. As night drew on I\r\nselected a camping-place, gathered wood into a heap, and felt for my\r\nlens to procure fire. It was gone. If the earth had yawned to swallow\r\nme I would not have been more terrified. The only chance for life was\r\nlost. The last hope had fled. I seemed to feel the grim messenger who\r\nhad been so long pursuing me knocking at the portals of my heart as I\r\nlay down by the side of the wood-pile, and covered myself with limbs\r\nand sage brush, with the dreadful conviction that my struggle for life\r\nwas over, and that I should rise no more. The floodgates of misery\r\nseemed now to be opened, and it rushed in a living tide upon my soul.\r\nWith the rapidity of lightning, I ran over every event of my life.\r\nThoughts doubled and trebled upon me, until I saw, as if in vision, the\r\nentire past of my existence. It was all before me, as if painted with a\r\nsunbeam, and all seemingly faded like the phantoms of a vivid dream.\r\n\r\nAs calmness returned, reason resumed her empire. Fortunately, the\r\nweather was comfortable. I summoned all the powers of my memory,\r\nthought over every foot of the day's travel, and concluded that the\r\nglass must have become detached from my belt while sleeping. Five\r\nlong miles over the hills must be retraced to regain it. There was\r\nno alternative, and before daylight I had staggered over half the\r\ndistance. I found the lens on the spot where I had slept. No incident\r\nof my journey brought with it more of joy and relief.\r\n\r\nReturning to the camp of the previous night, I lighted the pile I had\r\nprepared, and lay down for a night to rest. It was very cold, and\r\ntowards morning commenced snowing. With difficulty I kept the fire\r\nalive. Sleep was impossible. When daylight came, I was impressed with\r\nthe idea that I must go on despite the storm. A flash--momentary but\r\nvivid--came over me, that I should be saved. Snatching a lighted brand,\r\nI started through the storm. In the afternoon the storm abated and the\r\nsun shone at intervals. Coming to a small clump of trees, I set to\r\nwork to prepare a camp. I laid the brand down which I had preserved\r\nwith so much care, to pick up a few dry sticks with which to feed it,\r\nuntil I could collect wood for a camp-fire, and in the few minutes thus\r\nemployed it expired. I sought to revive it, but every spark was gone.\r\nClouds obscured the sun, now near the horizon, and the prospect of\r\nanother night of exposure without fire became fearfully imminent. I sat\r\ndown with my lens and the last remaining piece of touchwood I possessed\r\nto catch a gleam of sunshine, feeling that my life depended on it. In\r\na few moments the cloud passed, and with trembling hands I presented\r\nthe little disk to the face of the glowing luminary. Quivering with\r\nexcitement lest a sudden cloud should interpose, a moment passed before\r\nI could hold the lens steadily enough to concentrate a burning focus.\r\nAt length it came. The little thread of smoke curled gracefully up\r\nwards from the Heaven-lighted spark, which, a few moments afterwards,\r\ndiffused with warmth and comfort my desolate lodgings.\r\n\r\nI resumed my journey the next morning, with the belief that I should\r\nmake no more fires with my lens. I must save a brand, or perish. The\r\nday was raw and gusty; an east wind, charged with storm, penetrated my\r\nnerves with irritating keenness. After walking a few miles the storm\r\ncame on, and a coldness unlike any other I had ever felt seized me. It\r\nentered all my bones. I attempted to build a fire, but could not make\r\nit burn. Seizing a brand, I stumbled blindly on, stopping within the\r\nshadow of every rock and clump to renew energy for a final conflict\r\nfor life. A solemn conviction that death was near, that at each pause\r\nI made my limbs would refuse further service, and that I should sink\r\nhelpless and dying in my path, overwhelmed me with terror. Amid all\r\nthis tumult of the mind, I felt that I had done all that man could do.\r\nI knew that in two or three days more I could effect my deliverance,\r\nand I derived no little satisfaction from the thought that, as I was\r\nnow in the broad trail, my remains would be found, and my friends\r\nrelieved of doubt as to my fate. Once only the thought flashed across\r\nmy mind that I should be saved, and I seemed to hear a whispered\r\ncommand to \"struggle on.\" Groping along the side of a hill, I became\r\nsuddenly sensible of a sharp reflection, as of burnished steel. Looking\r\nup, through half-closed eyes, two rough but kindly faces met my gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Are you Mr. Everts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. All that is left of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have come for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who sent you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Judge Lawrence and other friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless him, and them, and you! I am saved!\" and with these words,\r\npowerless of further effort, I fell forward into the arms of my\r\npreservers, in a state of unconsciousness. I was saved. On the very\r\nbrink of the river which divides the known from the unknown, strong\r\narms snatched me from the final plunge, and kind ministrations wooed me\r\nback to life.\r\n\r\nBaronet and Prichette, my two preservers, by the usual appliances, soon\r\nrestored me to consciousness, made a camp upon the spot, and while\r\none went to Fort Ellis, a distance of seventy miles, to return with\r\nremedies to restore digestion and an ambulance to convey me to that\r\npost, the other sat by my side, and with all the care, sympathy, and\r\nsolicitude of a brother, ministered to my frequent necessities. In\r\ntwo days I was sufficiently recovered in strength to be moved twenty\r\nmiles down the trail to the cabin of some miners who were prospecting\r\nin that vicinity. From these men I received every possible attention\r\nwhich their humane and generous natures could devise. A good bed was\r\nprovided, game was killed to make broth, and the best stores of their\r\nlarder placed at my command. For four days, at a time when every day's\r\nlabor was invaluable in their pursuit, they abandoned their work to aid\r\nin my restoration. Owing to the protracted inaction of the system, and\r\nthe long period which must transpire before Prichette's return with\r\nremedies, my friends had serious doubts of my recovery.\r\n\r\nThe night after my arrival at the cabin, while suffering the most\r\nexcruciating agony, and thinking that I had only been saved to die\r\namong friends, a loud knock was heard at the cabin door. An old man\r\nin mountain costume entered--a hunter, whose life was spent among the\r\nmountains. He was on his way to find a brother. He listened to the\r\nstory of my sufferings, and tears rapidly coursed each other down\r\nhis rough, weather-beaten face. But when he was told of my present\r\nnecessity, brightening in a moment, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Why, Lord bless you, if that is all, I have the very remedy you need.\r\nIn two hours' time all shall be well with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the cabin, returning in a moment with a sack filled with the\r\nfat of a bear which he had killed a few hours before. From this he\r\nrendered out a pint measure of oil. I drank the whole of it. It proved\r\nto be the needed remedy, and the next day, freed from pain, with\r\nappetite and digestion reestablished, I felt that good food and plenty\r\nof it were only necessary for an early recovery.\r\n\r\nIn a day or two I took leave of my kind friends, with a feeling of\r\nregret at parting, and of gratitude for their kindness as enduring as\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMeeting the carriage on my way, I preceded to Boseman, where I remained\r\namong old friends, who gave me every attention until my health was\r\nsufficiently restored to allow me to return to my home at Helena.\r\n\r\nMy heartfelt thanks are due to the members of the expedition, all of\r\nwhom devoted seven, and some of them twelve days to the search for me\r\nbefore they left Yellowstone Lake; and to Judge Lawrence, of Helena,\r\nand the friends who co-operated with him in the offer of reward which\r\nsent Baronet and Prichette to my rescue.\r\n\r\nMy narrative is finished. In the course of events the time is not far\r\ndistant when the wonders of the Yellowstone will be made accessible to\r\nall lovers of sublimity, grandeur, and novelty in natural scenery, and\r\nits majestic waters become the abode of civilization and refinement;\r\nand when that arrives, I hope, in happier mood and under more\r\nauspicious circumstances, to revisit scenes fraught for me with such\r\nthrilling interest; to ramble along the glowing beach of Bessie Lake;\r\nto sit down amid the hot springs under the shadow of Mount Everts; to\r\nthread unscared the mazy forests, retrace the dreary journey to the\r\nMadison Range, and with enraptured fancy gaze upon the mingled glories\r\nand terrors of the great falls and marvellous cañon, and to enjoy, in\r\nhappy contrast with the trials they recall, their power to delight,\r\nelevate, and overwhelm the mind with wondrous and majestic beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOWSTONE PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as Dr. Hayden could make known officially the results of his\r\nexploration of the Yellowstone Basin, action was begun to secure the\r\nreservation of a portion at least of the marvellous scenes which it\r\nembraces, for the undivided benefit, enjoyment and instruction of the\r\ncountry at large.\r\n\r\nA bill to this effect was introduced into the Senate of the United\r\nStates, on the 18th of December, 1871, by Hon. S. C. Pomeroy of\r\nKansas. About the same time a similar bill was offered in the House of\r\nRepresentatives by Hon. William H. Claggett, delegate from Montana. The\r\nbill was referred to the Committees on Public Lands in both houses, who\r\nafter due consideration returned with approbation the following report\r\nprepared by Dr. Hayden:\r\n\r\n\"The bill now before Congress has for its object the withdrawal from\r\nsettlement, occupancy, or sale, under the laws of the United States, a\r\ntract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles, about the sources of the\r\nYellowstone and Missouri Rivers, and dedicates and sets it apart as a\r\ngreat national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment\r\nof the people. The entire area comprises within the limits of the\r\nreservation contemplated in this bill is not susceptible of cultivation\r\nwith any degree of certainty, and the winters would be too severe for\r\nstock-raising. Whenever the altitude of the mountain districts exceeds\r\n6,000 feet above tide-water, their settlement becomes problematical\r\nunless there are valuable mines to attract people. The entire area\r\nwithin the limits of the proposed reservation is over 6,000 feet in\r\naltitude, and the Yellowstone Lake, which occupies an area fifteen by\r\ntwenty-two miles, or three hundred and thirty square miles, is 7,427\r\nfeet. The ranges of mountains that hem the valleys in on every side\r\nrise to the height of 10,000 and 12,000 feet and are covered with snow\r\nall the year. These mountains are all of volcanic origin, and it is\r\nnot probable that any mines or minerals of value will ever be found\r\nthere. During the months of June, July, and August the climate is\r\npure and most invigorating, with scarcely any rain or storms of any\r\nkind, but the thermometer frequently sinks as low as 26°. There is\r\nfrost every month of the year. This whole region was, in comparatively\r\nmodern geological times, the scene of the most wonderful volcanic\r\nactivity of any portion of our country. The hot springs and the\r\ngeysers represent the last stages--the vents or escape-pipes--of these\r\nremarkable volcanic manifestations of the internal forces. All these\r\nsprings are adorned with decorations more beautiful than human art ever\r\nconceived, and which have required thousands of years for the cunning\r\nhand of nature to form. Persons are now waiting for the spring to open\r\nto enter in and take possession of these remarkable curiosities, to\r\nmake merchandise of these beautiful specimens, to fence in these rare\r\nwonders, so as to charge visitors a fee, as is now done at Niagara\r\nFalls, for the sight of that which ought to be as free as the air or\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn a few years this region will be a place of resort for all classes of\r\npeople from all portions of the world. The geysers of Iceland, which\r\nhave been objects of interest for the scientific men and travellers\r\nof the entire world, sink into insignificance in comparison with the\r\nhot springs of the Yellowstone and Firehole Basins. As a place of\r\nresort for invalids, it will not be excelled by any portion of the\r\nworld. If this bill fails to become a law this session, the vandals\r\nwho are now waiting to enter into this wonder-land will, in a single\r\nseason, despoil, beyond recovery, these remarkable curiosities, which\r\nhave required all the cunning skill of nature thousands of years to\r\nprepare.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GIANTESS.]\r\n\r\n\"We have already shown that no portion of this tract can ever be made\r\navailable for agricultural or mining purposes. Even if the altitude\r\nand the climate would permit the country to be made available, not\r\nover fifty square miles of the entire area could ever be settled. The\r\nvalleys are all narrow, hemmed in by high volcanic mountains like\r\ngigantic walls.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of this tract, therefore, from sale or settlement takes\r\nnothing from the value of the public domain, and is no pecuniary loss\r\nto the Government, but will be regarded by the entire civilized world\r\nas a step of progress and an honor to Congress and the nation.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Senate the bill was ably advocated by Messrs. Pomeroy, Edmunds,\r\nTrumbull, Anthony and others. In the House the favorable remarks of\r\nHon. H. L. Dawes were so clear and forcible that the bill was passed\r\nwithout opposition.\r\n\r\nThe text of the Act is as follows:\r\n\r\n \"_Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n States of America in Congress assembled_, That the tract of land in the\r\n Territories of Montana and Wyoming, lying near the headwaters of the\r\n Yellowstone River, and described as follows, to wit, commencing at the\r\n junction of Gardiner's River with the Yellowstone River, and running\r\n east to the meridian passing ten miles to the eastward of the most\r\n eastern point of Yellowstone Lake; thence south along said meridian to\r\n the parallel of latitude passing ten miles south of the most southern\r\n point of Yellowstone Lake; thence west along said parallel to the\r\n meridian passing fifteen miles west of the most western point of Madison\r\n Lake; thence north along said meridian to the latitude of the junction\r\n of the Yellowstone and Gardiner's River; thence east to the place of\r\n beginning, is hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy,\r\n or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart\r\n as a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of\r\n the people; and all persons who shall locate or settle upon or occupy\r\n the same, or any part thereof, except as hereinafter provided, shall be\r\n considered trespassers and removed therefrom.\r\n\r\n \"SEC. 2. That said public park shall be under the exclusive control\r\n of the Secretary of the Interior, whose duty it shall be, as soon as\r\n practicable, to make and publish such rules and regulations as he may\r\n deem necessary or proper for the care and management of the same.\r\n Such regulations shall provide for the preservation, from injury or\r\n spoliation, of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities\r\n or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural\r\n condition. The Secretary may, in his discretion, grant leases for\r\n building purposes for terms not exceeding ten years, of small parcels\r\n of ground, at such places in said park as shall require the erection\r\n of buildings for the accommodation of visitors; all of the proceeds of\r\n said leases, and all other revenues that may be derived from any source\r\n connected with said park, to be expended under his direction in the\r\n management of the same, and the construction of roads and bridlepaths\r\n therein. He shall provide against the wanton destruction of the fish and\r\n game found within said, park, and against their capture or destruction\r\n for the purposes of merchandise or profit. He shall also cause all\r\n persons trespassing upon the same after the passage of this act to be\r\n removed therefrom, and generally shall be authorized to take all such\r\n measures as shall be necessary or proper to fully carry out the objects\r\n and purposes of this act.\"\r\n\r\nThis Act was approved March 1, 1872; and shortly after the Hon. N. P.\r\nLangford, whose graphic descriptions of the Wonders of the Yellowstone\r\nfirst called public attention thereto, was appointed Superintendent of\r\nthe Park.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Langford appears to have underestimated this fall.
