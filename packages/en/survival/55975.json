The first encounter was with the giant Jovian\r\nplanetary system, 645 million kilometers (400 million miles) away.\r\nPassing by Jupiter and its complex satellite system in 1979, the Voyager\r\nspacecraft have collected and returned to Earth an enormous amount of\r\ndata and information that may prove to be a keystone in understanding\r\nour solar system.\r\n\r\nThis publication provides an early look at the Jovian planetary system\r\nand contains a selected sample from the more than 30,000 images\r\ncollected during this phase of the Voyager mission. While Voyager\r\nachieved an impressive record of accomplishments, full realization of\r\nthe scientific value of this program must await the remaining Voyager\r\nencounters with Saturn and perhaps Uranus, and a detailed analysis of\r\nthe data from all the spacecraft investigations.\r\n\r\n                                       Robert A. Frosch, _Administrator_\r\n                         _National Aeronautics and Space Administration_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Introduction\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March 1979 Voyager 1 swept past Jupiter, photographing both the giant\r\nplanet and five of its moons. Four months later, a companion spacecraft,\r\nVoyager 2, made a similar encounter. Now, with Jupiter receding behind\r\nthem, both spacecraft are headed toward the outer reaches of our solar\r\nsystem. In November 1980, Voyager 1 will fly past Saturn. Voyager 2,\r\ntraveling at slower speeds, will reach the same way station in August\r\n1981. Beyond there, the itinerary is less certain. In January 1986,\r\neight years after its departure from Earth, Voyager 2 may sail within\r\nrange of Uranus, taking closeup pictures of that distant planet for the\r\nfirst time. Long after they have exhausted their fuel supplies and their\r\nradios have fallen silent, both spacecraft will continue their traverse\r\nthrough space and beyond our solar system, on an endless journey.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _An Apollo 12 astronaut retrieves Surveyor 3 hardware\r\n    for Earth laboratory analysis after 30 months exposure on lunar\r\n    surface._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Viking Lander 2 surveys the boulder-strewn Utopian\r\n    Plain and reddish sky of Mars._]\r\n\r\nPreliminary results of the Voyager encounters with Jupiter are presented\r\nin this booklet. As you examine the pictures, you will be participating\r\nin a revolutionary journey of exploration. Living in a society where\r\nmany accomplishments and products are billed as “extraordinary,”\r\n“stupendous,” “once in a lifetime,” or “unique,” we sometimes lose our\r\nperspective. Conditioned to hyperbole, we fail to recognize those\r\nadvances that are truly exceptional. We need a historian’s vantage point\r\nto identify the events that can literally change the course of\r\ncivilization. So it is that every student of history recognizes the\r\nimportance of the Renaissance, an extraordinary time when man looked\r\noutward, reaching beyond the traditions of the past to study his place\r\nin the natural world. The results were apparent in art, architecture,\r\nand literature, in new philosophic and governmental systems, and in the\r\nstaggering scientific revolution exemplified by Galileo’s first\r\nexamination of the heavens with a telescope, and in his stubborn support\r\nof the heretical assertion that the Earth was _not_ the center of the\r\nsolar system.\r\n\r\nHistorians writing a hundred or two hundred years from now may well look\r\non the latter part of the twentieth century as another turning point in\r\ncivilization. For the first time, we explored beyond Earth—first the\r\nMoon, then the neighboring planets, and finally the outermost planets,\r\nthe very fringe of our solar system.\r\n\r\nHow will the historian evaluate this period of exploration? First,\r\nperhaps, he will describe the Apollo program as a visionary example of\r\ngreat cooperative ventures that can be accomplished by many individuals,\r\nprivate companies, and government institutions. He will describe the\r\nsubsequent space ventures that weave a fabric of cooperation and\r\ngoodwill between nations.\r\n\r\nHe will point out the technological advances incorporated in unmanned\r\nspacecraft, sophisticated robots able to control their own activities\r\nand solve their own problems. He will mention the revolution in\r\nmicroelectronics—the art of fabricating complex electrical control\r\ncircuits so small the eye cannot perceive them, a revolution accelerated\r\nby the requirement to conserve weight and generate performance in\r\ninterplanetary spacecraft. He will point to the introduction of new\r\nproducts, particularly in areas of communication, medical treatment, and\r\nenergy conversion.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Galileo orbiter and probe mission to Jupiter in 1985\r\n    will expand upon the Voyager investigations of the Jovian system._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _A solar electric propulsion spacecraft would eject\r\n    an instrumented probe toward Halley’s comet in 1986 and continue on\r\n    to rendezvous with another comet, Tempel 2._]\r\n\r\nTurning his attention to the environment, the historian will almost\r\nsurely suggest that the first widespread realization of the fragile\r\nnatural balances on Earth came at a time when we were first able to see\r\nour Earth in its entirety. The impact of a picture of Earth from deep\r\nspace, a luminously blue globe surrounded by darkness, has probably been\r\nmore persuasive than lengthy treatises describing the complex ways in\r\nwhich our system of rocks, plants, animals, water, and air is\r\ninterrelated. On a more practical level, the historian will point to the\r\nnew understanding of our terrestrial environment. The composition and\r\nstructure of other planetary atmospheres—on Venus, Mars, and\r\nJupiter—provide important clues to what may happen in our own\r\natmosphere, especially if we disrupt the chemical composition. Study of\r\nthe primitive crusts of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury permits us to\r\nreconstruct the first billion years of Earth history, a time when\r\nchemical elements were being concentrated in activity ultimately leading\r\nto the formation of important ore deposits. Unmanned spacecraft missions\r\nto the Sun increase our understanding of that most fundamental of all\r\nenergy sources, paving the way for the efficient conversion of solar\r\nenergy into many practical applications, and releasing us from\r\ndependence on ever-decreasing reserves of fossil fuels. Spacecraft\r\ncircling the Earth study the upper atmospheric processes that play major\r\nroles in controlling our weather. These same spacecraft look down on\r\nEarth, aiding us with increasingly accurate forecasts of weather and\r\ncrop productivity.\r\n\r\nLooking beyond matters of technology and the environment, the historian\r\nmay cite the latter part of the twentieth century as a time of explosive\r\nexploration, comparable to the 15th and 16th century exploration of the\r\nEarth’s oceans and the distant lands that bounded them. In a sense,\r\nexploration—whether it is physical or intellectual—provides its own\r\nrewards. The United States has always been a nation that moves forward,\r\npushing back the frontiers of the West, pushing back the frontiers of\r\nsocial and economic development, and now pushing back the frontiers of\r\nspace. It is arguable that this spirit of exploration is indispensable\r\nto a vigorous society, and that any society that ceases to explore, to\r\ninquire, and to strive is only a few years from decline.\r\n\r\nAnd so the historian may recall the early days of lunar exploration, the\r\nApollo project, the landing of unmanned Viking spacecraft on Mars, and\r\nthe encounters of Voyager spacecraft with Jupiter and Saturn as the\r\nfirst steps in a sustained program of space exploration—a program that\r\nis profoundly changing man’s perspective of himself, of the Earth, and\r\nof the larger cosmos beyond.\r\n\r\n            Thomas A. Mutch, _Associate Administrator for Space Science_\r\n                         _National Aeronautics and Space Administration_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Images of Jupiter and Its Satellites\r\n\r\n\r\n  The date of each photograph and the distance of the spacecraft from\r\n  the planet or satellite are included with each picture.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 2/5/79    28.4 million km    (17.6 million mi)\r\n\r\n    Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter\r\n    11 times that of Earth. Jupiter rotates very quickly, making one\r\n    full rotation in just under ten hours. Composed primarily of\r\n    hydrogen and helium, Jupiter’s colorfully banded atmosphere displays\r\n    complex patterns highlighted by the Great Red Spot, a large,\r\n    circulating atmospheric disturbance. Three of Jupiter’s 13 known\r\n    satellites are also visible in this Voyager 1 photograph. The\r\n    innermost large satellite, Io, can be seen in front of Jupiter and\r\n    is distinguished by its bright, orange surface. To the right of\r\n    Jupiter is Europa, also very bright but with fainter surface\r\n    markings. Callisto is barely visible beneath Jupiter. These\r\n    satellites orbit Jupiter in the equatorial plane and appear in their\r\n    present position because Voyager is above the plane.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Jupiter’s atmosphere is undergoing constant change,\r\n    presenting an ever-shifting face to observers. The Great Red Spot\r\n    has undergone three major periods of activity in the last 15 years.\r\n    These images of Jupiter, taken by Voyager 1 (top) and Voyager 2\r\n    (bottom) almost four months apart, show that cloud movement in the\r\n    Jovian atmosphere is not uniform because wind speeds vary at\r\n    different latitudes. For example, the white ovals which appear below\r\n    the Great Red Spot dramatically shifted between January and May, the\r\n    time interval between these two pictures. The bright “tongue”\r\n    extending upward from the Great Red Spot interacted with a thin,\r\n    bright cloud above it that had traveled twice around Jupiter in four\r\n    months. Eddy patterns to the left of the Great Red Spot, which have\r\n    been observed since 1975, appear to be breaking up.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 1/24/79    40 million km    (25 million mi)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 5/9/79    46.3 million km    (28.7 million mi)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 2/25/79    9.2 million km    (5.7 million mi)\r\n\r\n    The Great Red Spot on Jupiter is a tremendous atmospheric storm,\r\n    twice the size of Earth, that has been observed for centuries. The\r\n    Great Red Spot rotates counterclockwise with one revolution every\r\n    six days. Wind currents on the top flow east to west, and currents\r\n    on the bottom flow west to east. This Voyager 1 picture shows the\r\n    complex flow and turbulent patterns that result from the Great Red\r\n    Spot’s interactions with these flows. The large white oval is a\r\n    similar, but smaller, storm center that has existed for about 40\r\n    years.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 7/3/79    6 million km    (3.72 million mi)\r\n\r\n    A comparison of the Voyager 2 photograph above with the preceding\r\n    Voyager 1 photograph shows several distinct changes in the Jovian\r\n    atmosphere around the Great Red Spot. The white oval beneath the\r\n    Great Red Spot in the first picture has moved farther around\r\n    Jupiter, and a different white oval has appeared under the Great Red\r\n    Spot in the Voyager 2 picture taken four months later. The disturbed\r\n    cloud regions around the Great Red Spot have noticeably changed, and\r\n    the white zone west of the Great Red Spot has narrowed.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/2/79    4 million km    (2.5 million mi)\r\n\r\n    High-speed wind currents in the mid-latitudes of Jupiter are shown\r\n    in this high-resolution Voyager 1 photograph. The pale orange line\r\n    running diagonally to the upper right is the high-speed north\r\n    temperate current with a wind speed of about 120 meters per second\r\n    (260 miles per hour), over twice as fast as severe hurricane winds\r\n    on Earth. Toward the top of the picture, a weaker jet of\r\n    approximately 30 meters per second (65 miles per hour) is\r\n    characterized by wave patterns and cloud features that rotate in a\r\n    clockwise manner.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/2/79    4 million km    (2.5 million mi)\r\n\r\n    The large brown-colored oval appearing in this Voyager 1 picture was\r\n    selected as one of the targets to be photographed near closest\r\n    approach to Jupiter because it is probably an opening in the upper\r\n    cloud deck that exposes deeper, warmer cloud levels. Brown ovals\r\n    (which can also be seen in the preceding and following photographs)\r\n    are common features in Jupiter’s northern latitudes and have an\r\n    average lifetime of one to two years.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 6/28/79    10.3 million km    (6.4 million mi)\r\n\r\n    Jupiter’s Equatorial Zone is the broad, orange band that traverses\r\n    the center of this Voyager 2 picture. This zone is characterized by\r\n    the wispy clouds along its northern edge. The brown oval was\r\n    observed by Voyager 1 four months earlier, illustrating the\r\n    stability of this type of feature in the Jovian atmosphere. In\r\n    contrast, the turbulent region in the lower right of the picture,\r\n    which lies just to the left of the Great Red Spot, shows features\r\n    that are relatively short lived. With the exception of the cooler\r\n    Great Red Spot, as colors range from white to orange to brown, we\r\n    are generally looking at deeper and warmer layers in the Jovian\r\n    atmosphere.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: This infrared image of Jupiter was taken from Earth\r\n    and shows heat radiating from deep holes in Jupiter’s clouds. Bright\r\n    areas in the image are higher temperature regions than the dark\r\n    areas and correspond to parts of the atmosphere that are relatively\r\n    free of obscuring clouds. The Great Red Spot appears on the left\r\n    limb, or edge of the planet, as a dark area encircled by a bright\r\n    ring, indicating that the Spot is cooler than the surrounding\r\n    region. The infrared image was recorded by the 200-inch Hale\r\n    telescope on Mount Palomar in California.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 1/10/79    535,000 km    (332 million mi)\r\n\r\n    This Voyager 1 picture was also taken the same day, about one hour\r\n    after the infrared image.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/5/79    515,000 km    (320,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    The largest aurora ever observed, nearly 29,000 kilometers (18,000\r\n    miles) long, appears in this Voyager 1 photograph, taken on the dark\r\n    side of Jupiter six hours after closest encounter. The auroral\r\n    lights are brighter than any northern lights seen on Earth.\r\n    Jupiter’s north pole is approximately midway along the auroral arc.\r\n    This timed exposure of the aurora also shows what appear to be\r\n    lightning storms several thousand kilometers below the aurora. The\r\n    strength of the lightning bolts is comparable to that of superbolts\r\n    seen near cloud tops above Earth. Lightning had been suspected to\r\n    exist on Jupiter, but at lower levels in the atmosphere.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/4/79    1.2 million km    (750,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    The first evidence of a ring around Jupiter is seen in this\r\n    photograph taken by Voyager 1. This photograph was part of a\r\n    sequence planned to search for such rings around Jupiter. The\r\n    multiple image of the extremely thin, faint ring appears as a broad\r\n    light band crossing the center of the picture. This multiple image\r\n    and the elongated, wavy motion of the background stars are due to\r\n    the 11-minute, 12-second exposure and the very slow natural\r\n    oscillation of the spacecraft. The ring, which is in Jupiter’s\r\n    equatorial plane, is invisible from Earth because of its thinness\r\n    and transparency and because of Jupiter’s brightness. The black dots\r\n    in the picture are calibration points in the camera.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Because of Voyager 1’s discovery of a ring around\r\n    Jupiter, Voyager 2 was programmed to take additional pictures of the\r\n    ring. These three Voyager 2 images show Jupiter’s ring in\r\n    progressively higher resolution. The pictures were taken when\r\n    Jupiter was eclipsed by the Sun, and the ring appears unusually\r\n    bright because of the forward scattering of sunlight by small ring\r\n    particles.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 7/10/79    1.45 million km    (900,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    In this four-picture mosaic, the arms of the ring curving toward the\r\n    spacecraft (on the near side of the planet) are cut off by the\r\n    planet’s shadow. Scientists estimate that the distance from the\r\n    Jovian cloud tops to the outer edge of the ring is 55,000 kilometers\r\n    (35,000 miles).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 7/10/79    1.55 million km    (961,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    In this picture, which is composed of six images, there is evidence\r\n    of structure within the ring, but the spacecraft motion during these\r\n    long exposures obscured the highest resolution detail. However,\r\n    there is speculation that the ring width, estimated at 6000\r\n    kilometers (4000 miles), contains more than one ring.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 7/10/79    1.45 million km    (900,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    This photograph is an enlargement of the isolated left frame in the\r\n    first picture and reveals a density gradient of very small particles\r\n    extending inward from the ring. The thickness of the ring has been\r\n    estimated at less than one kilometer (0.6 mile) although the ring\r\n    appears about 30 kilometers (19 miles) thick in the image, due to\r\n    camera motion and finite resolution. Composition of the low-albedo\r\n    (dark) particles is not known, but particle size probably ranges\r\n    from microscopic to at most a few meters in diameter. If collected\r\n    together to form a single body, the total mass of the Jovian rings\r\n    would form an object with a diameter less than twice that of tiny\r\n    Amalthea.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 2/13/79    20 million km    (12.4 million mi)\r\n\r\n    Jupiter and two of its planet-sized satellites, Io at left and\r\n    Europa at right, are visible in this Voyager 1 picture. Jupiter’s\r\n    four largest satellites—Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto—were\r\n    discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei. The two outer Galilean\r\n    satellites are Ganymede and Callisto, not shown in this picture. All\r\n    four satellites probably formed about four billion years ago but\r\n    their surfaces vary in age tremendously. Io and Europa have younger,\r\n    more active surfaces than Ganymede and Callisto. Like our Moon, the\r\n    satellites keep the same face toward Jupiter. In this picture, the\r\n    sides of the satellites that always face away from the planet are\r\n    visible.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Amalthea, Jupiter’s innermost satellite, was\r\n    discovered in 1892. It is so small and close to Jupiter that it is\r\n    extremely difficult to observe from Earth. Amalthea’s surface is\r\n    dark and red, quite unlike any of the Galilean satellites. The three\r\n    Voyager 1 pictures and the one Voyager 2 picture following (seen\r\n    against the disk of Jupiter) reveal a small, elongated object, about\r\n    265 kilometers (165 miles) long and 150 kilometers (90 miles) in\r\n    diameter. Amalthea keeps its long axis pointed toward Jupiter as it\r\n    orbits around the planet every 12 hours.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/4/79    1.25 million km    (780,000 mi)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/4/79    695,000 km    (430,000 mi)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/5/79    425,000 km    (264,000 mi)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 7/9/79    560,000 km    (350,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Amalthea was observed end-on in the Voyager 2 picture, which has\r\n    been computer-processed to enhance the image.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/4/79    377,000 km    (234,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Io, Jupiter’s innermost Galilean satellite, displays great diversity\r\n    in color and brightness. This Voyager 1 four-picture mosaic shows\r\n    Io’s complex coloration of red-orange, black, and white regions, and\r\n    the two major topographic features: volcanic regions, the most\r\n    prominent of which is the “hoofprint” (volcanic deposition feature)\r\n    in the center-right, and the intervolcanic plains that are\r\n    relatively featureless. Io’s vivid coloring is probably due to its\r\n    composition of sulfur-rich materials that have been brought to the\r\n    surface by volcanic activity.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/5/79    129,600 km    (80,500 mi)\r\n\r\n    The bright area at the upper right in this Voyager 1 picture of Io\r\n    appears to be a caldera (collapsed volcano) that is venting clouds\r\n    of gases. The clouds may condense to form extremely fine particles\r\n    that scatter light and appear blue. Because the infrared\r\n    spectrometer discovered sulfur dioxide on Io, scientists believe\r\n    this gas may be the main component of the clouds. Sulfur dioxide\r\n    clouds would rapidly freeze and snow back to the surface. It is also\r\n    possible that dark areas in the floors of the calderas are pools of\r\n    encrusted liquid sulfur.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/5/79    66,000 km    (41,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Evidence of erosion in Io’s southern polar region is visible in this\r\n    Voyager 1 high-resolution image. The picture has been\r\n    computer-enhanced to bring out surface detail while suppressing\r\n    bright markings. A depressed segment of the crust, bounded by\r\n    faults, is seen near the terminator in the upper right portion of\r\n    the image. At the lower center are complicated scarps (slopes) and\r\n    portions of isolated elevated terrain that geologists interpret as\r\n    “islands” left behind as the scarps eroded. Scientists speculate\r\n    that sulfur dioxide (as a subsurface liquid) may be a determinant in\r\n    the creation of these features.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/4/79    862,000 km    (540,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Io’s surface, less than ten million years old, is quite young\r\n    compared to the other Galilean satellites and to other terrestrial\r\n    bodies, such as Mercury and the Moon. The surface is composed of\r\n    large amounts of sulfur and sulfur dioxide frost, both of which\r\n    account for most of the surface color. This picture was taken by\r\n    Voyager 1. Material deposited by the volcano (see following\r\n    pictures) can be seen as a white ring near the center of Io.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The first active volcanic eruptions other than on\r\n    Earth were discovered on Io. These volcanoes are extremely explosive\r\n    with ejection velocities of more than one kilometer per second (2200\r\n    miles per hour), which is more violent than Etna, Vesuvius, or\r\n    Krakatoa on Earth. Both pictures below were taken by Voyager 1.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/4/79    450,000 km    (280,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    In this picture, the plume visible on the right edge extends more\r\n    than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above the surface.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/4/79    499,000 km    (310,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    The same volcano is shown in this picture, photographed one hour and\r\n    52 minutes earlier.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/4/79    490,000 km    (304,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Special color reconstruction by means of ultraviolet, blue, green,\r\n    and orange filters allowed scientists to study the amount of gas and\r\n    dust and the size of the dust particles that erupted from the\r\n    volcano on Io shown in this Voyager 1 image. The region that is\r\n    brighter in the ultraviolet (blue area) is about 210 kilometers (130\r\n    miles) high, over twice the height of the denser, bright yellow\r\n    core.

The\r\n    giant volcano observed by Voyager 1 over the “hoofprint” region (see\r\n    page 18) had become inactive. Scientists, therefore, believe that\r\n    the satellite is undergoing continuous volcanic activity, making\r\n    Io’s surface the most active in the solar system. This Voyager 2\r\n    photograph, which shows three active volcanoes, was one of the last\r\n    of an extensive sequence of “volcano watch” pictures planned as a\r\n    result of Voyager 1’s volcano discovery.

The surface displays a complex array\r\n    of streaks, indicating that the crust has been fractured. In\r\n    contrast to its icy neighbors Ganymede and Callisto, Europa has very\r\n    few impact craters. The relative absence of features and low\r\n    topography indicate that the crust is young and probably warm a few\r\n    kilometers below the surface. The warmth is probably due to a\r\n    combination of radioactive and tidal heating. The tidal heating\r\n    within Europa is estimated to be ten percent that of the stronger\r\n    tidal heating effect within Io. The regions that appear blue in this\r\n    Voyager 2 image are actually white.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 7/9/79    240,000 km    (150,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Europa’s surface is probably a thin ice crust overlying water or\r\n    softer ice (slush) about 100 kilometers (60 miles) thick that covers\r\n    a silicate interior. The tectonic processes on Europa’s surface\r\n    create patterns that are drastically different from the fault\r\n    systems seen on Ganymede’s surface, where pieces of the crust have\r\n    moved relative to each other. On Europa, the crust evidently\r\n    fractures, but the pieces remain roughly in their original position.\r\n    This Voyager 2 picture is composed of three images.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 7/9/79    240,000 km    (150,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Long linear fractures or faults which crisscross Europa’s surface in\r\n    various directions are over 1000 kilometers (600 miles) long in some\r\n    places. Large fractures are 200 to 300 kilometers (125 to 185 miles)\r\n    wide, wider than the crust is thick.

No large craters (more than five kilometers in diameter)\r\n    are identifiable in this Voyager 2 picture, indicating that this\r\n    satellite has a very young surface relative to Ganymede and\r\n    Callisto, although perhaps not as young as Io’s surface. Scientists\r\n    believe that the surface is a thin ice crust overlying water or\r\n    softer ice and that the fracture systems are breaks in the crust.\r\n    Resurfacing processes, such as the production of fresh ice or snow\r\n    along the cracks and cold glacier-like flows, have probably removed\r\n    evidence of impact events (cratering). Europa, therefore, appears to\r\n    have many properties similar to Ganymede and Io.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 7/9/79    240,000 km    (150,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    Complex narrow ridges, seen as curved bright streaks 5 to 10\r\n    kilometers (3 to 6 miles) wide and typically 100 kilometers (60\r\n    miles) long, characterize the surface topography of this view of\r\n    Europa.

The large bright\r\n    circular features have little relief and are probably the remnants\r\n    of old, large craters that have been annealed by the flow of icy\r\n    material near the surface. The gradually curving lines that press\r\n    through the dark region suggest the presence of a large impact basin\r\n    to the southwest, which has been obliterated by the subsequent\r\n    formation of younger grooved terrain.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: 3/5/79    165,000 km    (103,000 mi)\r\n\r\n    A broad, north-south strip of grooved terrain on Ganymede, offset by\r\n    a traversing fault in the upper part of the picture, is shown in\r\n    this Voyager 1 photograph.

The alignment of these large planets permits the use of\r\na gravity-assist trajectory in which the gravity field of Jupiter and\r\nJupiter’s motion through space may be used to hurl the spacecraft on to\r\nSaturn. In 1977, a rare alignment (once every 176 years) of our four\r\nouter planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—may permit a\r\ngravity-assist trajectory to Uranus and even to Neptune for Voyager 2.\r\n\r\nVoyagers 1 and 2 began their journeys in the late summer of 1977,\r\ncatapulted into space by a Titan/Centaur launch vehicle from Cape\r\nCanaveral, Florida. With them went the hopes and dreams of thousands of\r\npeople who had worked to create them and their mission.\r\n\r\nThe Voyager spacecraft are unique in many respects. Since their journeys\r\nare taking them far from the Sun, the Voyagers are nuclear powered\r\nrather than solar powered. The Voyagers are the fastest man-made objects\r\never to have left Earth. In fewer than ten hours, they had crossed the\r\nMoon’s orbit. This compares to about three days for an Apollo flight and\r\none day for the Mariner and Viking spacecraft. Their launches marked the\r\nend of an era in space travel—the end of the planned use of\r\nTitan/Centaur launch vehicles. With the advent of the Space Shuttle in\r\nthe 1980s, future spacecraft will be launched from the Shuttle Orbiter.\r\n\r\nVoyager 1 was launched 16 days after its sister ship, but because of a\r\ndifferent trajectory, it arrived at Jupiter four months ahead of Voyager\r\n2. Both spacecraft spent more than nine months crossing the asteroid\r\nbelt, a vast ring of space debris circling the Sun between the orbits of\r\nMars and Jupiter. During their 16- and 20-month journeys to Jupiter, the\r\nspacecraft tested and calibrated all of their instruments, exercised\r\ntheir scan platforms, and measured particles and fields in\r\ninterplanetary space. As the spacecraft neared the planet, the cameras\r\nshowed the dramatic visible changes that had taken place in the five\r\nyears since Jupiter had been photographed by Pioneer 11. And for the\r\nfirst time, we got a close look at some of Jupiter’s moons: Amalthea,\r\nIo, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.\r\n\r\nTargeted for the closest look at Io, Voyager 1 flew the more hazardous\r\ncourse, passing between Jupiter and Io, where the radiation environment\r\nis the most intense. Voyager 2’s flight path gave Jupiter and its\r\nintense radiation a much wider berth. Unlike Voyager 1, which\r\nencountered the five innermost satellites as it was leaving Jupiter,\r\nVoyager 2 encountered the satellites as it was approaching the planet,\r\nthus providing closeup photography of opposite sides of the satellites.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: March 5, 1979. _Voyager 1’s unique flight path\r\n    allowed scientists to study at close range 5 of Jupiter’s 13 known\r\n    satellites.

Closest approach was\r\n    280,000 kilometers (174,000 miles) from Jupiter._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: July 9, 1979. _Voyager 2’s closest approach to\r\n    Jupiter was 645,000 kilometers (400,000 miles) from the planet.\r\n    Voyager 2 encountered the satellites on its inbound journey to\r\n    Jupiter, which enabled the spacecraft to photograph the opposite\r\n    sides of the satellites._]\r\n\r\nArriving at Jupiter from slightly different angles, both spacecraft\r\nmeasured the large, doughnut-shaped ring of charged sulfur and oxygen\r\nions, called a torus, encircling the planet at about the orbit of Io.\r\nThen, both spacecraft disappeared behind Jupiter, out of view of Earth\r\nand Sun, for about two hours. During this time, measurements were taken\r\non the planet’s dark side. Each spacecraft took over 15,000 photographs\r\nof Jupiter and its satellites.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Voyager spacecraft and scientific instruments._]\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of launch, the Voyager spacecraft have been monitored by\r\na worldwide tracking system of nine giant antennas strategically located\r\naround the world in California, Spain, and Australia to ensure constant\r\nradio contact with the spacecraft as the Earth rotates. Radio contact\r\nwith Voyagers 1 and 2 has not been instantaneous, however. When Voyager\r\n1 flew past Jupiter, radio signals between Earth and the spacecraft took\r\n37 minutes; when Voyager 2 arrived, the signals took 52 minutes because\r\nby then the planet was farther from Earth.\r\n\r\nThe pictures in this book were taken by a shuttered television-type\r\ncamera. Each picture is composed of 640,000 dots, which were converted\r\ninto binary numbers before being radioed to Earth. When the signals\r\nreached Earth, they were reconverted by computer into dots and\r\nreassembled into the original image. Most of the color pictures are\r\ncomposed of three images, each one taken through a different color\r\nfilter: blue, orange, or green. The images were combined and the\r\noriginal color was reconstructed by computer. The computer eliminated\r\nmany of the imperfections that crept into the images, and enhanced some\r\nof the images by emphasizing different colors.\r\n\r\nDesigned to provide a broad spectrum of scientific investigations at\r\nJupiter, the science instruments investigated atmospheres, satellites,\r\nand magnetospheres. The scientific investigations for the Voyager\r\nmission and their Jovian encounter objectives are shown in the table on\r\npage 40.\r\n\r\nAfter their closest approaches to Jupiter, both spacecraft fired their\r\nthrusters, retargeting for their next goal, the Saturn system.\r\nScientists will still be studying the wealth of new information about\r\nJupiter when Voyager 1 reaches Saturn in November 1980, and Voyager 2\r\nfollows in August 1981. After Voyager 1 encounters Saturn, Voyager 2 may\r\nbe retargeted to fly past Uranus in 1986. Upon completion of their\r\nplanetary missions, both spacecraft will search for the outer limit of\r\nthe solar wind, that boundary somewhere in our part of the Milky Way\r\nwhere the influence of the Sun gives way to other stars of the galaxy.\r\nVoyagers 1 and 2 will continue to study interstellar space until the\r\nspacecraft signals can no longer be received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Scientific Highlights\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the most important information gathered by Voyagers 1 and 2 on\r\nthe Jovian system is presented pictorially in this book and is\r\nsupplemented here with brief summaries of the major discoveries,\r\nobservations, and theories.\r\n\r\n\r\nJupiter\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter is colorful, with cloud bands of alternating\r\ncolors. A major characteristic of the atmosphere is the appearance of\r\nregularly spaced features. Around the northern edge of the equator, a\r\ntrain of plumes is observed, which has bright centers representative of\r\ncumulus convection similar to that seen on Earth. At both northern and\r\nsouthern latitudes, cloud spots are observed spaced almost all the way\r\naround the planet, suggestive of wave interactions. The cloud structures\r\nin the northern and southern hemispheres are distinctly different.\r\nHowever, the velocities between the bright zones and dark belts appear\r\nto be symmetric about the equator, and stable over many decades. This\r\nsuggests that such long-lived and stable features may be controlled by\r\nthe atmosphere far beneath the visible clouds. The Great Red Spot\r\npossesses the same meteorological properties of internal structure and\r\ncounterclockwise rotation as the smaller white spots. The color of the\r\nGreat Red Spot may indicate that it extends deep into the Jovian\r\natmosphere. Cloud-top lightning bolts, similar to those on Earth, have\r\nalso been found in the Jovian atmosphere. At the polar regions, auroras\r\nhave been observed. A very thin ring of material less than one kilometer\r\n(0.6 mile) in thickness and about 6000 kilometers (4000 miles) in radial\r\nextent has been observed circling the planet about 55,000 kilometers\r\n(35,000 miles) above the cloud tops.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmalthea\r\n\r\nAmalthea is an elongated, irregularly shaped satellite of reddish color.\r\nIt is 265 kilometers (165 miles) long and 150 kilometers (90 miles)\r\nwide. Just like the large Galilean satellites, Amalthea is in\r\nsynchronous rotation, with its long axis always oriented toward Jupiter.\r\nAt least one significant color variation has been detected on its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\nIo\r\n\r\nEight active volcanoes have been detected on Io, with some plumes\r\nextending up to 320 kilometers (200 miles) above the surface. Over the\r\nfour-month interval between the Voyager 1 and 2 encounters, the active\r\nvolcanism appears to have continued. Seven of the volcanoes were\r\nphotographed by Voyager 2, and six were still erupting.\r\n\r\nThe relative smoothness of Io’s surface and its volcanic activity\r\nsuggest that it has the youngest surface of Jupiter’s moons. Its surface\r\nis composed of large amounts of sulfur and sulfur dioxide frost, which\r\naccount for the primarily yellow-orange surface color. The volcanoes\r\nseem to eject a sufficient amount of sulfur dioxide to form a\r\ndoughnut-shaped ring (torus) of ionized sulfur and oxygen atoms around\r\nJupiter near Io’s orbit. The Jovian magnetic field lines that go through\r\nthe torus allow particles to precipitate into the polar regions of\r\nJupiter, resulting in intense ultraviolet and visible auroras.\r\n\r\n\r\nEuropa\r\n\r\nEuropa, the brightest of Jupiter’s Galilean satellites, may have a\r\nsurface of thin ice crust overlying water or softer ice, with\r\nlarge-scale fracture and ridge systems appearing in the crust. Europa\r\nhas a density about three times that of water, suggesting it is a\r\nmixture of silicate rock and some water. Very few impact craters are\r\nvisible on the surface, implying a continual resurfacing process,\r\nperhaps by the production of fresh ice or snow along cracks and cold\r\nglacier-like flows.\r\n\r\n\r\nGanymede\r\n\r\nGanymede, largest of Jupiter’s 13 satellites, has bright “young” ray\r\ncraters; light, linear stripes resembling the outer rings of a very\r\nlarge, ancient impact basin; grooved terrain with many faults; and\r\nregions of dark, heavily cratered terrain. Among the Galilean\r\nsatellites, Ganymede probably has the greatest variety of geologic\r\nprocesses recorded on its surface and may be the best example for\r\nstudying the evolution of Jupiter’s inner satellites. Imbedded within\r\nJupiter’s magnetosphere, Ganymede is subjected to the influences of the\r\ncorotating charged-particle plasma and an interaction may exist with\r\nthis plasma. No atmosphere has been detected.\r\n\r\n\r\nCallisto\r\n\r\nThe icy, dirt-laden surface of Callisto appears to be very ancient and\r\nheavily cratered. The large concentric rings indicate the remains of\r\nseveral enormous impact basins, created by huge meteors crashing into\r\nthe surface, and since erased by the flow of the crust. Callisto’s\r\ndensity (less than twice that of water) is very close to that of\r\nGanymede, yet there is little or no evidence of the crustal motion and\r\ninternal activity that is visible on Ganymede.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Magnetosphere\r\n\r\nPerhaps the largest structure in the solar system is the magnetosphere\r\nof Jupiter. This is the region of space which is filled with Jupiter’s\r\nmagnetic field and is bounded by the interaction of that magnetic field\r\nwith the solar wind, which is the Sun’s outward flow of charged\r\nparticles. The plasma of electrically charged particles that exists in\r\nthe magnetosphere is flattened into a large disk more than 4.8 million\r\nkilometers (3 million miles) in diameter, is coupled to the magnetic\r\nfield, and rotates around Jupiter. The Galilean satellites are located\r\nin the inner regions of the magnetosphere where they are subjected to\r\nintense radiation bombardment. It appears that Io is a source of the\r\nsulfur and oxygen ions which fill the magnetosphere. Another\r\nmagnetospheric interaction is the electrical connection between Io and\r\nJupiter along the magnetic field lines that leave Jupiter and intersect\r\nIo. This magnetic flux tube was examined by Voyager 1 and a flow of\r\nabout five million amperes of current was measured, which was\r\nconsiderably more than anticipated. Voyager also discovered a new\r\nlow-frequency radio emission coming from Jupiter, which is possibly\r\nassociated with the Io torus.\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific investigations of the Voyager mission\r\n\r\n Investigation                  Typical Jovian encounter objectives\r\n\r\n Imaging science                High-resolution reconnaissance over large\r\n                                phase angles; atmospheric dynamics;\r\n                                geologic structure of satellites\r\n Infrared radiation             Atmospheric composition, thermal\r\n                                structure and dynamics; satellite surface\r\n                                composition and thermal properties\r\n Photopolarimetry               Atmospheric aerosols; satellite surface\r\n                                texture and sodium cloud\r\n Radio science                  Atmospheric and ionospheric structure,\r\n                                constituents, and dynamics\r\n Ultraviolet spectroscopy       Upper atmospheric composition and\r\n                                structure; auroral processes;\r\n                                distribution of ions and neutral atoms in\r\n                                the Jovian system\r\n Magnetic fields                Planetary magnetic field; magnetospheric\r\n                                structure; Io flux tube currents\r\n Plasma particles               Magnetospheric ion and electron\r\n                                distribution; solar wind interaction with\r\n                                Jupiter; ions from satellites\r\n Plasma waves                   Plasma electron densities; wave-particle\r\n                                interactions; low-frequency wave emissions\r\n Planetary radio astronomy      Polarization and spectra of radio\r\n                                frequency emissions; Io radio modulation\r\n                                process; plasma densities\r\n Low-energy charged particles   Distribution, composition, and flow of\r\n                                energetic ions and electrons;\r\n                                satellite-energetic particle interactions\r\n Cosmic ray particles           Distribution, composition, and flow of\r\n                                high-energy trapped nuclei; energetic\r\n                                electron spectra\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A computer-generated mosaic of Voyager 1 pictures\r\n    showing Jupiter from directly above the north pole.
