In some parts of the east coast of England, such as that\r\nwhich lies between Harwich and Walton-on-the-Naze, the sea appears\r\nto be slowly encroaching on the land, so that places which were\r\ngrazing-fields twenty or thirty years ago are now covered by the\r\nsea at high tide, and at low tide are mere sandy wastes threaded\r\nby rivulets of sea-water. On the south coast of the Isle of Wight,\r\nbetween Sandown and the Culver Cliff, which is the most easterly\r\npoint, the same loss of land is going on in another way. Some years\r\nago a fort stood rather near the edge of the cliff, and it would\r\nhave been possible to climb round the seaward wall of the fort. It\r\nis not possible now, for the outer sea-wall of the fort has long ago\r\nslipped into the sea; so have some of the inner fortifications: and\r\nit has been necessary to dismantle the whole of this fort lest every\r\npart of even the inner landward wall should follow the outer parts\r\nand slip with the solid ground down the cliff. It is easy to see\r\nwhat is happening here. The wind and the waves are undermining and\r\nhoneycombing the cliff. They are weakening its base and its body, and\r\nso the upper crust on which the fort was built, and into which its\r\nfoundations were dug, is slipping away. If we imagine for a moment\r\nthat nothing was done to save the fort or protect the cliff, but that\r\nall was left to nature to deal with, it would not be hard to picture\r\nwhat would happen. The cliff would gradually be eaten away: its\r\ngravel and clay would be drawn into the sea, and the Isle of Wight\r\nwould become a little smaller. The same thing is going on at a good\r\nmany places along the coast of the British Isles, as well as on the\r\ncoast of Florida and in the Gulf of California in America.\r\n\r\nThe little islet of Heligoland in the North Sea, which once belonged\r\nto Great Britain, but was some years ago handed over to Germany, is\r\nso fiercely attacked by the sea in this way, that it almost has to\r\nbe armour-plated in order to preserve its integrity. It is fenced\r\nin stone in order to protect it. What is happening on the coasts of\r\nislands like England and Heligoland is happening all over the world.\r\nIt has always happened. If it had not happened in past ages there\r\nwould be no British Isles at all, because once England and Scotland\r\nand Ireland were joined to Europe, and it would have been possible to\r\nwalk across the North Sea from Harwich to the Hook of Holland. The\r\nNorth Sea was once dry land. But the sea encroached on it from the\r\nnorth, and the Atlantic Ocean battered a way through on the south,\r\ntill the English Channel was bored through into the shallow waters of\r\nthe newly-formed North Sea, and the lands that had once been part of\r\nEurope became these \"sceptred isles set in the silver sea.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not all the story. What the sea takes away it gives again.\r\nSir Thomas Holditch is our authority for saying that on some parts of\r\nthe Pacific coast of America you may at some points see on the one\r\nhand dry land which by the shells found on it shows that the sea once\r\nflowed over it; while side by side with this raised land you may sail\r\na boat over forests now sunk beneath the sea. The loss of bits and\r\ncorners of England is serious--so serious that a Royal Commission on\r\nSea Erosion, as the process is called, was appointed to inquire into\r\nthe extent of the loss and the means by which it might be remedied.\r\nBut in some parts of our coast the land is not losing, but gaining.\r\nIf the sea takes away sand and gravel, chalk and shale and clay from\r\nthe cliffs, these materials are not lost. Something is done with\r\nthem. They must at some points, where the tides and currents of the\r\nsea deposit them, make the sea more shallow. Perhaps the sea lays\r\nthem down as beds or sand-banks. Perhaps it carries them round the\r\ncoast to some other point and there drops them. Can you not see that\r\nin this way the sea which at one point is dragging down the coast\r\nmay at other points be building it up, or may be even constructing\r\nbreakwaters made out of these stolen materials?\r\n\r\nThe sea is not the only carrier which is thus laying down beds of\r\nmaterial. The rivers are doing the same thing. Every shower of\r\nrain washes some dirt--by which we mean sand or gravel or loam or\r\nchalk--from the land into the nearest rivulet. The rivulet hurries\r\nwith it down to the neighbouring river, and the river carries it down\r\nto the sea. If the river is going very fast it carries most of its\r\ndirt along with it, and we generally find the river muddy after rain.\r\nBut when the river slackens its pace, as it usually does when it\r\nnears the sea and meets the sea's tides, then it lets the dirt fall;\r\nand thus at the river's mouth we find mud-banks or sand-banks. If a\r\nriver is left long enough to its own devices, these sand-banks will\r\nso increase in bulk that the mouth of the river will become shallower\r\nand shallower and will spread. It silts up, and when a river is\r\nneeded for the navigation of ships large sums of money have to be\r\nspent, as in the Scheldt or at the mouth of the Thames, in dredging\r\nthis mud so as to keep the channels clear.\r\n\r\nThere are many striking examples of this land-building by rivers;\r\nand the deltas of rivers, so called from their resemblance to the\r\nGreek letter Δ, form in some instances great areas. The\r\nMississippi, the Nile, and the Ganges, for example, are surrounded by\r\ngreat tracts of land at their mouths, which are formed entirely from\r\nmatter brought down by the rivers and deposited at lower levels than\r\nthose at which the rivers originated. The Mississippi, which drains\r\na river basin of 1,147,000 square miles, has an annual discharge\r\nof sediment of no less than 7,459,267,200 cubic feet. The Italian\r\nRiver Po, draining an area of 30,000 square miles, discharges\r\n1,510,137,000 cubic feet of sediment annually. This is equivalent\r\nto a lowering of its whole drainage area by 1/729th of a foot per\r\nannum, so that in a thousand years the whole area over which it flows\r\nhas been lowered by the river by more than a foot. The Thames alone\r\ncarries down 5,000,000 tons of material each year. All this must be\r\nredeposited somewhere. Where the redeposition takes place we find new\r\nland forming, new beds, new _strata_, in which in ages to come the\r\nfuture tenants of the globe may find relics of the people and animals\r\nliving to-day.\r\n\r\nThus there are several evident ways in which the coast-line of a\r\ncountry might be altered, either in the direction of enlarging its\r\nboundaries by additions to it made by the sea or by rivers; or in\r\nthe direction of losing parts of its territory by wear and tear. But\r\nthere are other changes going on which are not so easy to perceive,\r\nand which are not so easy to account for. The thing hardest to\r\nexplain is why what is now dry land should have risen out of the sea,\r\nas certainly it did. The white cliffs of Dover are made of chalk, and\r\nchalk is made of innumerable shells of tiny animals which once lived\r\nin the sea and which at their death sank to the sea's bottom. They\r\nsteadily accumulated there for ages in a grey ooze, and in course of\r\ntime this grey ooze rose above the waves. It dried and became land.\r\nBut chalk is not found in cliffs by the sea only. It is found far\r\ninland. It is found, for example, in the North Downs, which run from\r\nGuildford to Reigate and from Reigate to Limpsfield and Westerham--a\r\ngreat ridge of chalk, at some points 600 to 800 feet high. That\r\nridge must at one time have been at the sea bottom. And if we were\r\nto examine the whole of England and sink borings in it, we should at\r\none point or another come to some remains of rocks, or some \"strata,\"\r\nas they are called, which are of such make and material that we can\r\nonly believe them to have been laid down at the sea bottom. The\r\nonly conclusion we can come to, therefore, is that by some means or\r\nother, and at some time or other, the islands of England were slowly\r\nlifted above the sea, and that at some other time the sea was slowly\r\nlifted above them. What is true of England is true of nearly all the\r\nregions of the world that have been closely examined by geologists.\r\nEverywhere there is the evidence of different stages of existence in\r\nthe land's history--stages when it was covered by the sea; stages\r\nwhen it was dry land again; perhaps stages when it was covered by\r\nlakes, by vast forests; stages when it may have been covered by ice;\r\nstages when it was desert. Some of these stages show far vaster\r\nupheavals than others, and the changes wrought were of far greater\r\nextent. Everybody has heard that the great Saharan desert was perhaps\r\nonce the bed of an ocean. That is an assertion to which, perhaps, we\r\nmay be a little chary of committing ourselves; but there is excellent\r\nreason for believing that once some of the great African lakes were\r\nconnected with the sea; and we are quite certain that once Africa was\r\nan island. So that in the case of that vast continent we know that it\r\nmust have seen periods of great depression and elevation; ages when\r\nit was much lower than it is now, and ages when it was higher.\r\n\r\nWe will not at this moment stop to give further examples. We will\r\nonly try to see whether there is any explanation which would make\r\nit possible to understand why there should be these slow upheavals\r\nand subsidences of the earth's surface. The chief and most important\r\nreason is that the earth is not so solid as it looks, and not so\r\nsolid as it feels. It would be easier to realise this if, instead of\r\nliving in a part of the earth like Great Britain, where there are\r\nvery few earthquakes, we lived in Japan, or Central America, or in\r\nthe archipelago of islands which runs from Java to Borneo and further\r\nsouth. In these places, where never a year passes but that the earth\r\ncan be felt to quiver beneath one's feet, and where earthquakes\r\nwhich wreck houses are at least as common as eclipses of the moon,\r\nit is easier to believe that the earth is a rather shaky body; or,\r\nas scientific men would call it, a rather unstable body. But if,\r\nlike those scientific men who take up the study of earthquakes, or\r\n\"seismology,\" we equipped ourselves with instruments to measure or\r\nrecord earthquakes, we should perceive even in England that the earth\r\nis nearly always quivering. Something is always snapping or giving\r\nway in its interior, and producing trembling fits that sometimes can\r\nbe felt hundreds of miles away, and sometimes can be felt all over\r\nthe earth. There are on the average at least twenty earthquakes a\r\nyear which make the whole of this round globe tremble.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that either these shocks or breakages\r\nin the earth's crust, or the earth's interior, must be very great\r\nindeed, or else that the earth must be composed of rather shaky\r\nmaterials. Well, perhaps both these suppositions are true. We spoke\r\njust now of the instruments which seismologists use to record\r\nearthquakes. They are known as \"seismometers,\" and a great many of\r\nthem are used in Japan and on the Californian or Pacific coast of\r\nAmerica. Now it is perhaps scarcely necessary to say here (when we\r\nrecollect how many cyclones and anticyclones England receives from\r\nthe Atlantic) that a storm or rainy weather is usually heralded or\r\naccompanied by a fall in the barometer, or a depression. Now when\r\nthere is a depression in the barometer that means that the weight of\r\nair above the barometer is less than it was before, though it is not\r\nso great a difference that human beings could tell it, unless it were\r\naccompanied by other signs. But the earth can tell it, and the mere\r\nfall of the barometer, owing to changes of the air, will make the\r\nearth tremble or quiver slightly, as if it were a jelly. We cannot\r\nperceive it; but the delicate seismometers can; and when a storm is\r\ncoming to Japan or to California from the Pacific, the instruments\r\nshow that the earth feels the passage of it. The comparison of the\r\nearth to a jelly--a very stiff jelly--is on the whole a useful one.\r\n\r\nIf a very tall jelly is allowed to stand for some time, or if\r\nthe table on which it stands is shaken a good deal, then, as we\r\nknow, rifts will sometimes appear in the jelly. The reason for\r\nthese breakdowns in the jelly's composition is that owing to the\r\ndistribution of its weight it is always in what we call a state of\r\nstrain; and it is sometimes not strong enough to support this strain,\r\nand, almost without apparent cause, will sometimes give way. Much\r\nmore solid bodies than jelly act in the same way. The great bridge\r\nnear Quebec which collapsed in 1907 was to all appearance quite sound\r\nand strong; but there were strains in the iron girders, and without\r\nwarning these strains suddenly produced rifts in the iron and steel\r\nframework and it broke down. Similarly the towers of churches and\r\ncathedrals, which are built on arches, will give away quite suddenly\r\nafter standing to all appearance quite firm for hundreds of years.\r\nThere is an architect's maxim which runs, \"The arch never sleeps.\"\r\nThat means that the arches on which the great weight of a church\r\nor cathedral tower rests are always in a state of strain; they are\r\nalways, as it were, imperceptibly quivering; and they are always\r\nliable, if the strain on them should be increased in the slightest\r\ndegree, to give way, or to resettle the weight on their shoulders in\r\nsome way.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the great globe which we call the earth is in this\r\nstate of strain; and it is always liable to rifts within itself and\r\nto readjustments of the weights of its own parts. It is not so easy\r\nto understand how a great globe spinning through space can be in a\r\nstate of strain, or can attempt to readjust the weight of its parts,\r\nas in the instances we have just given of the quivering jelly or the\r\nsolid cathedral tower. Perhaps another illustration may help us. We\r\nwill presume that nearly everybody is acquainted with the modern\r\nrubber-cored golf ball. The modern golf ball, as those who are\r\naware who either intentionally or unintentionally have cut through\r\nits outer cover, consists first of a small hard core. Round this is\r\nwound very tightly some two hundred yards of elastic. The tighter\r\nthis is wound the better, or at any rate the more \"bouncing\" will\r\nbe the resulting ball of india-rubber elastic. But consider what is\r\nthe usual condition of this rubber-wound ball. Like our jelly it is\r\nalways in a state of stretch or strain. Even when covered with the\r\nouter shell which completes the golf ball, the whole ball is still,\r\nwe might say, in a state of strain or tension. That is one of the\r\nreasons why it bounces, and why it flies better than the old solid\r\nball off the face of a golf club. But if you were to keep a golf ball\r\nfor a hundred years these strains in its interior would alter and\r\nadjust themselves. One result would certainly be that the golf ball\r\nmight lose its elasticity. Another result would be that its shape\r\nwould slightly alter.\r\n\r\nNow a golf ball, however carefully it is made, is not always evenly\r\nmade. It weighs a little more on one side than another; and the best\r\ngolf balls, those which fly truest and farthest, are those which are\r\nmost evenly made: so that we might say of them that the centre of\r\ntheir weight was exactly the same as the centre of the ball. If it\r\nis not, then the strains in the ball are always pulling it a little\r\nmore out of shape; and the ball, as golfers say, flies badly. Now\r\nthe earth is like a badly made golf ball. The centre of its weight,\r\nor, as we call it, the centre of gravity, is not quite at the centre\r\nof the earth. Moreover, owing to the enormous pressures which exist\r\nright through the earth, and which are by no means the same at every\r\nplace inside the earth, but are, in fact, continually changing,\r\nowing to hundreds of causes, the whole of the earth's interior is in\r\na state of unequal strain. What is the consequence that you would\r\nexpect? Is it not that the earth should always be making efforts to\r\nadjust its weight, and, as it were, to distribute it evenly? It has\r\nbeen doing this for millions of years. It has not yet finished.\r\n\r\nLastly, the cover of a golf ball is comparatively a stiff and\r\nunyielding substance which does not betray on its surface, if it is\r\nallowed to lie at rest, the tensions and strains of the rubber core\r\ninside. But the crust of the earth, which we have compared to the\r\ngolf ball's cover, is not unyielding or rigid. It is practically\r\na part of the case of the earth; and it does show and reflect the\r\nstrains and tensions of the movements and rifts of the core. So that\r\nas in the course of ages the straining core changes, and gives way,\r\nalters itself and adjusts itself--so the crust of the earth alters\r\nwith it. Some of these changes are sudden and violent. Some of them\r\ntake place very slowly, occupying thousands or hundreds of thousands\r\nof years in the gradual process of change; and then perhaps for ages\r\nthe earth's crust will be slowly sinking in one place and slowly\r\nrising in another. Thus, what was once a depression in the earth's\r\nsurface may be now an elevation; what was once below the level of\r\nthe sea may be now a continent of land; and what was once land may\r\nnow have sunk beneath the incoming sea. Thus, what was sandstone\r\nrock of the earth's surface may become covered with forest, and the\r\nforest may sink below the sea, only to be pushed up again and become\r\ndry land a million years later. Each of these changes will leave\r\nits mark, each will be accompanied by deposits. The deposits may be\r\nvegetable matter, trees and mosses, and the growth of swamps, such\r\nas coal was first made of; or they may be the ocean sludge, which at\r\nlast became chalk or limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH'S SHAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have compared the earth to a golf ball, and as it spins through\r\nspace, impelled by a force millions of times greater than the\r\nstrongest driver ever imparted to the best-made \"Haskell,\" its flight\r\nand general appearance are not unlike those of the rubber-cored\r\nball. The earth, for one thing, is not smooth; it has roughnesses\r\nand corrugations all over its surface, similar to those of a golf\r\nball, though much less regular, and it spins as it flies. But let us\r\nnow consider the differences. Suppose the golf ball had a spot of\r\nwater clinging to it as water clings to a greasy shot. Where would\r\nthe water lie? The first answer that occurs to one is that the water\r\nwould be shaken off the ball in the course of its flight; and that\r\nis, indeed, very likely. But suppose the water were very sticky, or\r\nwere very much attracted by the golf ball (which is another way of\r\nstating the same supposition), where would it lie then? To that we\r\ncan only say that there does not seem any very evident reason why\r\nit should lie on one part of the flying golf ball more than on any\r\nother--if the golf ball were perfectly round.\r\n\r\nThat is, on the whole, a reasonable answer. But apply the same\r\nreasoning to the question of where the waters of the earth in the\r\nshape of oceans ought to lie as they cling to the spinning globe.\r\nThey cling to the globe, not because they are sticky, but because\r\nof the attraction which we say is due to gravity--the force which\r\nmakes everything in nature attract every other thing, and which makes\r\neverything tend to fall to the earth (and to stay there). They do\r\nso because the earth, being so very heavy and bulky in comparison\r\nwith anything in its neighbourhood, has such an enormous pull. How\r\ngreat that pull is may be dimly gathered from the reflection that\r\nthough the earth is spinning at the rate of a thousand miles an hour,\r\nnothing is ever shaken off. The oceans are not shaken off. They\r\ncling. But why is it that they are not equally distributed all over\r\nthe face of the earth? If a map of the earth be examined, or still\r\nbetter a globe with the oceans and continents correctly drawn on it,\r\nit will be found that there is a great mass of land all lying grouped\r\ntogether on one side of the earth, and a great basin of waters on\r\nthe other. Let the reader imagine himself a thousand miles above the\r\nearth, looking down at a point in it about midway between Madeira and\r\nthe Bermudas. What would he see? He would see the Atlantic Ocean, but\r\nall around it would be grouped great masses of land--Europe, Africa,\r\nNorth America, Asia--and if it were his first sight of the earth and\r\nhe knew nothing of its geography, he would be likely to suppose that\r\nthe earth was nearly all land, with one comparatively small stretch\r\nof unfrozen ocean. But now let the reader move round the earth to a\r\npoint exactly opposite that at which he took his first observations\r\nand look down again. He will now see the Australian continent and the\r\nland which covers the South Pole, but except for the pointed tail of\r\nSouth America, and perhaps a glimpse of the blunter point of South\r\nAfrica, he will be looking down on a globe which seems to be largely\r\ncovered with water.\r\n\r\nWhy should this be? It must be due to the shape of the earth. The\r\nfact is, the earth would make a very bad golf ball. It is by no\r\nmeans of that perfection of symmetry which they say enables a golf\r\nball to fly well and to run true on the putting greens. The earth\r\nis, in fact, not perfect as a sphere, either within or without.\r\nIts centre is not in the same place as the centre of its weight,\r\nand it is not round in shape. Everybody has heard that the earth\r\nis slightly flattened at the poles; but its irregularity goes much\r\nfurther than that. If we could strip it of its oceans, which fill up\r\na good many of its imperfections, we should find its shape not that\r\nof a neat, round golf ball at all. The earth's actual shape without\r\nits oceans, its \"geoid,\" as it is called, is that of a pear. The\r\nstalk of the pear is in the southern part of Australia, and contains\r\nAustralasia and the Antarctic continent. This is surrounded on all\r\nsides but one (towards South America) by a sort of belt of depression\r\nin which the waters lie. That is the waist of the pear. This again\r\nis surrounded on all sides but one (towards the east of Japan) by\r\na belt of elevation. That is the protuberant part of the pear, and\r\nhere the great continental land areas rise. Finally, we find the\r\nnose of the pear in the central Atlantic, between the Madeiras and\r\nthe Bermudas. Of course, the resemblance to a pear is not a very\r\nmarked one. Our observer a thousand miles above the earth would not\r\nbe able to perceive it, nor would the astronomers in the moon, if any\r\nastronomers existed there. But the earth is pear-shaped to a small\r\nextent nevertheless, and in the case of such an enormous mass a very\r\nslight deviation from rotundity will produce very great effects.\r\n\r\nMost of us have played at such ball games as bowls or billiards;\r\nand I have assumed that everybody knows something about golf. What\r\nhappens in a game at bowls to the bowl which is not evenly weighted\r\nall through? It will not run straight. It has a bias. What happens\r\nto a billiard ball which is not perfectly round, or has lost its\r\nsymmetry through age? It wobbles. And what happens to a badly made\r\ngolf ball? That performs all sorts of exasperating antics. It ducks,\r\nit soars, it curls, it takes a slice. It also wobbles. Now that is\r\nexactly what the spinning, unevenly shaped globe which we call the\r\nearth has been doing for millions of years. It has been wobbling;\r\nand as we showed in the last chapter, it has always been trying to\r\nright itself. Thus the two poles have not always been in the same\r\nposition; the oceans have not always been where they are. The waters\r\nhave sometimes crawled up the land towards the poles and sometimes\r\nreceded. Regions that have sometimes been frozen and cold have\r\nbecome warmer, and have covered themselves now with oceans, and now\r\nwith forests, and now with deserts. There is no corner of the whole\r\nworld which has not undergone changes of climate. These changes\r\nare very slow. There is no reason for supposing, in spite of the\r\nlaments we sometimes hear about the loss of old-fashioned winters\r\nand old-fashioned summers, that the climate of England, for example,\r\nhas changed in the least since Cæsar's legions landed on its shores.\r\nThe Roman settlers in Britain doubtless experienced sloppy winters\r\nand wet summers now and again, just as we do; and King Arthur's\r\nknights, no doubt, had their saddening experiences of November\r\nfogs. Yet slowly and surely changes of climate do take place, and\r\nnothing except the winds influence them more than does the presence\r\nof a neighbouring sea or ocean. Most of us reckon the warmth of a\r\nlocality's climate by the distance it is from the pole. That is,\r\nhowever, a very rough and ready method. Vladivostok is roughly the\r\nsame distance from the North Pole as Venice; but there is a good deal\r\nof difference in the temperature of the two places. In Manchuria when\r\nthe Russians and Japanese were entrenched before Mukden men died of\r\ncold and were frozen at their posts at a time when other people in\r\nMentone and Monte Carlo, at the same distance from the Arctic Circle,\r\nwere complaining of the heat. So that we see that it must not be\r\nassumed that a place like England (where for two thousand years we\r\noccasionally have had winters that would kill trees like eucalyptus\r\nor fig trees, and where oranges could never ripen in the open air)\r\nwas always equally cold. It may have been, in fact we know it must\r\nhave been, warm enough once to encourage and support what resembled\r\na tropical vegetation. It must also have been at one time as cold as\r\nSiberia in the winter.\r\n\r\nTherefore we should expect to find, if we digged down in the\r\nearth, or in any portion of the earth which had undergone these\r\nchanges, some traces of them. For example, if at one time the sea\r\ncovered England for thousands or hundreds of thousands of years,\r\ndepositing the remains of millions of animals on the sea's bottom\r\nduring that period, we should expect to find some traces of these\r\nremains--perhaps in the form of chalk, seeing that the bones and\r\nshells of fishes dwelling in the sea contain a good deal of lime.\r\nOr again, if a forest covered England and grew and decayed there,\r\nnot merely for a period like that which has elapsed since the Romans\r\nfirst set foot in Britain, but for a hundred times as long, we should\r\nexpect to find some sort of vegetable deposit, hardened most probably\r\nby other layers above it. Do we? Well, coal is a vegetable deposit.\r\nIf there was a time when ice covered the land we should expect to\r\nfind traces of that; if a time when the land was desert; or when it\r\nwas a lake--each and every one of these periods ought to leave some\r\nremains, some epitaph of itself. So they do.\r\n\r\nLet us for a moment consider with Sir Archibald Geikie[1] the\r\nsubsoil beneath cities that have been inhabited for many centuries.\r\nIn London, for example, when excavations are made for drainage,\r\nbuilding, and other purposes, there are sometimes found, many\r\nfeet below the level of the present streets, mosaic pavements and\r\nfoundations, together with earthern vessels, bronze implements,\r\nornaments, coins, and other relics of Roman time. Now if we knew\r\nnothing from actual authentic history of the existence of such a\r\npeople as the Romans these discoveries deep beneath the surface\r\nof modern London would prove that long before the present streets\r\nwere built the site of the city was occupied by a civilised race\r\nwhich employed bronze and iron for the useful purposes of life,\r\nhad a metal coinage, and showed not a little artistic skill in its\r\npottery, glass, and sculpture. But down beneath the rubbish wherein\r\nthe Roman remains are embedded lie gravels and sands from which\r\nrudely fashioned human implements of flint, arrow-heads, hammers,\r\nand the like have been obtained. From that we learn that before the\r\nRomans came an earlier race had been there which employed weapons and\r\ninstruments of roughly chipped flint.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sir Archibald Geikie's _Introduction to Geology_.]\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt that this was the order of the successive peoples\r\noccupying the site of London. It is obvious. Why is it? We see that\r\nthere are, broadly, three layers or deposits. The upper layer is that\r\nwhich encloses the foundations and rubbish of our own era and times.\r\nNext below is that which encloses the relics of Roman occupation. At\r\nthe bottom lies that which encloses the scanty traces of the early\r\nflint-folk. The uppermost deposit is necessarily the newest, for it\r\ncould not be laid down until after the accumulation of those below\r\nit; and those below it must be progressively older, as they are\r\ntraced deeper from the surface. By the mere fact that the layers lie\r\none above the other we are furnished with a simple clue which enables\r\nus to determine the order of their formation. We may know nothing\r\nwhatever as to how old they are, measured by years or centuries. But\r\nwe can be absolutely certain that the bottom layer came first, and\r\nthe top layer came last. This kind of observation will enable us to\r\nfind proofs everywhere that the surface of the land has not always\r\nbeen what it is to-day. In some districts, for example, when the dark\r\nlayer of soil in which vegetables grow is turned up, there may be\r\nfound beneath it sand and gravel full of smooth, well-rounded stones.\r\nSuch materials are to be seen in course of formation where water\r\nkeeps them moving to and fro, as on the beds of rivers, the margins\r\nof lakes, or the shallow shores of the sea. Wherever smooth-rolled\r\npebbles occur they point to the influence of moving water, so that\r\nwe conclude, even though the site is now dry, that water once moved\r\nabove it. Again, below the soil in other regions lie layers of\r\noysters and other sea shells.\r\n\r\nPits, quarries, and mines that cut down still deeper into the earth\r\nand lay it bare bring before our eyes most impressive testimony\r\nregarding the ancient changes of the land. Suppose, by way of further\r\nillustration, that underneath a bed of sand full of oyster shells\r\nthere lies a dark brown band of peat. This substance, composed of\r\nmosses and other water-loving plants, is formed in boggy places by\r\nthe growth of marshy vegetation. Below the peat there might occur\r\na layer of soft white marl full of lake shells, such as may be\r\nobserved on the bottom of many lakes at the present time. These\r\nthree layers--oyster beds, peat, and marl--would be like a family\r\npedigree showing the history of the place. The bottom layer of white\r\nmarl would show that there was once a lake. The next layer of peat\r\nwould show that by the growth of marshy vegetation the lake became\r\nchoked up and was gradually changed into a swamp and then a morass.\r\nThe other layer of oyster shells would show that the ground was\r\nafterwards submerged by the sea. The present condition of the ground\r\nwould show that the sea at last retired, and the place passed into\r\ndry land as it is to-day.\r\n\r\nBy such a method of examination we may frame for ourselves pictures\r\nof the earth's surface long before history began, or before man\r\nroamed the earth. It is for this reason that geology has been\r\ncalled the science that investigates the history of the earth. The\r\nrecords in which this history is chronicled are the soils and rocks\r\nunderneath our feet. It is the task of the geologist so to arrange\r\nand interpret these records as to show through what successive\r\nchanges the globe has passed, and how the dry land came to wear the\r\naspect which it presents at the present time.\r\n\r\nTo do this efficiently the geologist has to learn many things. He has\r\nto observe very closely the changes which are going on about him on\r\nthe world's surface. Only in so far as he makes himself acquainted\r\nwith these sudden changes can he hope to follow intelligently and\r\nsuccessfully the story of earlier phases in the earth's progress. Nor\r\nis it sufficient to observe, however closely, inanimate things. If\r\nhe did not know the peculiarities of fresh-water shells, how would\r\nhe be able to say the shells in the marl deposit were fresh-water\r\nanimals (and that therefore a lake once lay there) and not sea\r\nshells. If the labour of the geologist were concerned merely with\r\nthe former changes of the earth's surface--how sea and land have\r\nchanged places, how rivers have altered their courses, how valleys\r\nhave been dug out, and how mountains have been carved, how plains\r\nhave been spread out, and how all these things have been written on\r\nthe framework of the earth--he would still feel one very great want,\r\nthe want of living interest. But that also his science gives him,\r\nfor in these past eras living things dwelt and moved and had their\r\nbeing. And it is one of the most entrancing pursuits of the geologist\r\nto trace their lives, their descent and ascent, and the relics of\r\nthemselves that they left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF WEATHER ON THE EARTH'S HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same causes that produced the layers of peat or sand, or\r\nlimestone, or clay, which we find by examination of the earth's\r\nsurface, are acting to-day. Coal is forming now; and so is limestone;\r\nand so is sandstone; so even is granite. But these layers or strata\r\nform very slowly, so that since man has kept historical records\r\nthe thickness of new strata laid down could be measured in inches.\r\nConsequently we are only able to see the beginnings of the processes.\r\nAfter the materials were laid down by water or the shifting winds, or\r\nby the decay of other materials already in position, they underwent\r\nvarious changes. For example, many layers, instead of consisting of\r\nloose materials such as gravel, sand, or mud, are now hard stone.\r\nSometimes this consolidation has been the result of pressure. As\r\nbed was piled over bed those at the bottom would be more and more\r\ncompressed by the increasing weight of those laid down upon them;\r\nthe water would be squeezed out; the particles would stick closer\r\ntogether. Mud, for example, might thus turn into clay; and clay,\r\npressed harder and harder, might be converted into mudstone or\r\nshale. But there is another agency at work. We have all seen mortar\r\nhardening and binding bricks together; or cement hardening into\r\nconcrete. Similarly sedimentary deposits are bound together by\r\ncements, of which there are many which exist naturally. For example,\r\nsilica is a natural cement; and so is carbonate of lime; and so is\r\nperoxide of iron. All these will bind other particles together. But\r\nhow do they arrive at the layers of particles? By the same action\r\nwhich lays down the particles themselves. They are rubbed off the\r\nplaces where they exist by the wind or by water. Perhaps they were\r\nlaid down among the deposited particles of mud or sand. Perhaps they\r\nwere brought to them by streams or rivers or lakes, and sank with\r\nthe water into them. In a red sandstone, for example, the quartz\r\ngrains of the rock may be often observed to be coated with earthy\r\niron peroxide, which serves to bind them together into a rather hard\r\nstone. On the other hand, the process is often being reversed. The\r\nweather frequently conspires by frost and wind and rain to remove\r\nthe binding cement, and thereby to allow the stone to return to its\r\noriginal condition of loose sediment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the Colossal Natural Bridges of Utah\r\n\r\nThis is an instance in which water has hollowed out the lower strata,\r\nleaving a harder upper stratum partially intact.]\r\n\r\nFor millions of years the winds have blown over the surface of the\r\nearth, the rain has fallen on it, the sun heated it by day, the\r\nfrost cracked it. Consider the winds that have circled the earth.\r\nAll movements of the air are due in the first place to the sun which\r\nheats the atmosphere and causes it to expand. The sun's rays passing\r\nthrough the air do not heat it at once, or directly, but heat the\r\nland and the sea, which absorb some of the rays and reflect others\r\nand so warm the air in contact with them. But, as will readily be\r\nunderstood, the land and the sea do not absorb and reflect the heat\r\nrays in the same way or to the same extent; nor do the sun's rays\r\nfall equally or constantly on all portions of the earth's surface.\r\nSo that from various causes one part of the earth is always being\r\nwarmed in a different way from other parts, and the air above the\r\nearth is being warmed in an immeasurable number of different ways.\r\nEven if the earth's surface were all water or all land, we should\r\nexpect therefore that there would be movements of the air due to\r\nunequal heating. If, however, the earth's surface were quite even\r\nand uniform, we should expect that there would be a certain evenness\r\nand uniformity about the movements of the air. These movements\r\nwould be due partly to the regular heating and regular cooling of\r\nthe surface, and partly due to the fact that the earth is spinning\r\nround taking the air with it--but not taking it quite evenly. The\r\nair does not fit tightly on to the earth. It is rather like a loose,\r\nbaggy envelope with a tendency to slip as the earth moves round.\r\nFurthermore, a point situated on the Equator has much farther to\r\ntravel in twenty-four hours as the earth spins round than a point\r\nsituated in the Arctic Circle, where a tape measure placed along one\r\nof the parallels of latitude (let us say the eighty-sixth parallel,\r\nwhere Nansen turned back in his search for the Pole) would show the\r\nearth's girth there to be, not twenty-four thousand miles, but only\r\nso many hundreds. This also would make a difference in the way the\r\nair would be whirled round the earth; but we could take this point\r\ninto consideration, and should be able, if, as we have said, our\r\nearth were quite uniform, to say always and at all times of the year\r\nin what direction the prevailing wind should blow.\r\n\r\nEven with all the earth's irregularities we do know a good deal\r\nwith certainty about the earth's prevailing winds: the trades; the\r\nanti-trades; the south-west monsoon, which sets in so regularly in\r\nIndia that year by year its advent hardly varies by more than a day;\r\nand, in the descending scale of regularity, the east winds that\r\nusually sweep England in March, and the prevailing south-westerly\r\nto westerly winds which bend most of the young trees of the country\r\na little to the north-east. Besides these regularly or irregularly\r\ndefined winds, there are certain paths along the earth's surface\r\nwhere the winds always move like a trout stream with eddies in it.\r\nThese eddies of the air we call cyclones, and they are continually\r\ntravelling in one direction. No doubt they arise from the air in one\r\nplace becoming hotter or moister than in the surrounding regions.\r\nAs the air grows hotter it becomes lighter and ascends, while the\r\nheavier air round it pours in. These eddies always travel eastwards\r\nand incline in the northern hemisphere towards the north. They\r\nusually originate somewhere on the North American continent, and move\r\nacross the Atlantic about the pace of a slow railway train, winds\r\nwhirling round them all the time at a much greater pace. Usually\r\nthe centres of these eddies bear northward past the north coast of\r\nScotland to the north-west of Norway. Sometimes, however, they take\r\na more southerly course, keeping to the south of the British Isles\r\nand passing over Central Europe on to Siberia, where they appear to\r\ndie away.\r\n\r\nSuch are the cyclones which are in the main part responsible for\r\nBritish weather; and the winds that accompany them vary a great\r\ndeal in strength. They depend on the size of the eddy. If the eddy\r\nis a very big one (and sometimes the eddies are thousands of miles\r\nacross) the winds will not be so strong as in the smaller ones. It\r\nis, therefore, the smaller ones which cause the violent storms.\r\nIn the tropical regions whirling eddies of a rather different\r\ncharacter occur. To quote Mr. J. H. N. Stephenson: \"Instead of being\r\nmeasured by some hundreds or even thousands of miles, they are\r\nusually only some hundreds of yards across; and as we found that\r\nthe smaller the cyclone the more violent the wind, we shall not be\r\nsurprised that the wind in these is more violent than anything we\r\never experience in this part of the world. They are called by many\r\ndifferent names; in the West Indies they are known as _hurricanes_,\r\nin the south-east of Asia as _typhoons_, and in North America as\r\n_tornadoes_. These hurricanes or tornadoes travel much faster than\r\nthe larger cyclones, and the winds blowing into them are so violent\r\nthat everything--trees, houses, bridges--are swept before them, and\r\nso strong is the in-draught of air in the centre that strong walls\r\nare sucked in just as a piece of paper is in front of a grate when\r\nthe fire begins to blaze up; and even heavy metal objects are carried\r\n_upwards_. Fortunately these tornadoes do not travel continuously\r\nalong the ground but bump along it, so to speak, sometimes passing\r\nharmlessly overhead, then striking the earth again and causing more\r\nhavoc. Where they pass over the surface of the sea the water is\r\nsometimes sucked in just in the same way, causing what is known as a\r\n_waterspout_. These may do even more damage than a tornado on land,\r\nfor the water is sometimes carried bodily on to the land, sweeping\r\neverything away in a deluge. This happened many years ago in the\r\ndelta of the Ganges, when thousands of people perished.\"\r\n\r\nNow let us see how these winds might leave traces in the geological\r\nrecord. When soil is exposed to the sun its surface becomes dust, and\r\nthe wind carries it off. Even where turf protects the surface, bare\r\nplaces may always be found whence this covering has been removed.\r\nRabbits and moles bring up the earth to the surface; the earthworms\r\nsometimes bring as much as ten tons of earth to the surface of a\r\nsingle acre of turf in the course of a year. The earthworms bring up\r\nonly the finest particles of mould; and these, of course, are the\r\nvery particles readily converted into dust and borne away by the\r\nwind if they are not washed away by rain. In tropical countries the\r\nwhite ant conveys a prodigious amount of fine earth up into the open\r\nair, building walls sometimes sixty feet high. Although, therefore,\r\nthe layer of vegetable soil which covers the land appears to be a\r\npermanent protection, it does not really prevent a large amount\r\nof material from being removed even from grassy ground. The wind\r\ncarries this fine dust far and wide over the land, and over the sea\r\nas well. After the eruption of the island of Krakatoa in 1883, the\r\ndust which was the product of that mighty explosion was carried round\r\nthe world, and even in England we saw the dust particles furnishing\r\nextraordinary colours in sunset skies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nThe Garden of the Gods, Colorado\r\n\r\nThese peaks exhibit the gradual wearing away of hard rocks by the\r\naction of rain and wind.]\r\n\r\nIn dry countries, especially in the large tracts of Central Asia\r\nand of Africa, the air is often so thick with a fine yellow dust\r\nthat the sun's light struggles through it as through a London fog.\r\nThe dust settles on everything, and after many centuries a deposit,\r\nwhich may be hundreds of feet deep, is thus accumulated on the\r\nsurface of the land. Some of the ancient cities of the old world,\r\nNineveh and Babylon for example, after being long abandoned by man,\r\nhave gradually been buried under the fine soil which the wind blew\r\nover them. Even in England the Roman town of Silchester, not far\r\nfrom Reading, after falling into decay when its inhabitants left it,\r\nhas been buried under the accumulations of two thousand years, and\r\nits walls and floors now lie underground and have to be carefully\r\nunearthed in order to lay them bare. But we need not seek these\r\nexceptional cases in order to perceive what the wind is doing with\r\nsand and the fine dust of the earth's uppermost layers. At many\r\nplaces round the coast are sand-dunes. On sandy shores, exposed\r\nto the winds that blow off the sea, the sand is dried and carried\r\naway from the beach, gathering into long mounds or ridges which run\r\nparallel to the coast-line. These ridges are often fifty or sixty\r\nfeet, sometimes even more than 250 feet high, with deep troughs and\r\nirregular hollows between them, and they sometimes form a strip\r\nseveral miles broad bordering the sea. These sand-hills creep\r\nfarther inland, till their progress is stopped by the fields or woods\r\nthey encounter, or till, by seeds finding a root, vegetation springs\r\nup on them and they harden and consolidate under the influence of\r\ntheir own vegetation and move inland no farther. But in many parts of\r\nWestern Europe and Eastern America the dunes are marching inland at\r\nthe rate of twenty feet a year. Off the coast of Friesland and North\r\nGermany the danger has grown so threatening that scientific attention\r\nhas been given to the problem; and the German scientific men have\r\nemployed ingenious devices of planting wind-stakes--something like\r\nthe wooden breakwaters that are to be found along every seaside\r\nbeach, but arranged at different angles,--of forcing the sand-dune\r\nto heap itself up so as to form an obstruction to further arrivals;\r\nor of sowing those plants in the sand that will bind its particles\r\ntogether, in order to preserve the land from further invasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nA Curious Rock greatly revered by the Natives\r\n\r\nThis is the Dance Rock of the Walpi Indians of Arizona. Its curious\r\nshape is the result of weathering.]\r\n\r\nWhat goes on along the coast finds a parallel in the interior of\r\ncontinents where, as in Arizona, in America, or by the desert of\r\nGobi, in Asia, or in the Karroo of South Africa, or in Central\r\nAustralia and Africa, there is great dryness of climate and a\r\ncontinual disintegration of the surface rocks. Sometimes the dust or\r\nsand remains and gradually consolidates or hardens. More often it is\r\nonly a temporary visitor. Wind and rain are continually removing it,\r\nsometimes in vast quantities, into the sea; and in the course of time\r\nthe most astounding changes are wrought in the surface and appearance\r\nof the land. The softer rocks are worn down; the harder ones are left\r\nsticking out. Gradually the surface is carved out into heights and\r\nhollows. The harder rocks become the hills and ridges; the softer\r\nrocks are worn into valleys and plains. If there were no water left\r\non the earth's surface a great deal of this process would still go\r\non. In some respects it might become more violent, for owing to the\r\nabsence of moisture the winds of the earth would always be laden with\r\nfine particles; and every one who has seen a \"sand-blast\" at work, or\r\neven the modified sand-blast which is sometimes used for cleaning the\r\nstonework of some of our cities, will appreciate what a tornado laden\r\nwith sand grains might do in the way of destroying the surface of any\r\nrock on which it was playing. But, as a matter of fact, the action of\r\nwater in carving the surface of the earth is the most important of\r\nall the factors we have at present to consider.\r\n\r\nAs rain falls from the clouds it absorbs the gases of the air,\r\nincluding oxygen and carbonic acid. Now both these are what we call\r\ncorroding agents. If water is allowed to fall on a steel knife the\r\nknife rusts; but it has been shown by Dr. Gerald Moody, during the\r\nlast few years, that if there were no acid gas present, the rusting\r\nwould not take place. Oxygen and carbonic acid will rust other things\r\nbeside metal; they will rust stone. Moreover, when the rain reaches\r\nthe earth it absorbs any other acids of the soil which rotting\r\nvegetation may afford, and reinforced by these it goes on to attack\r\nthe stones over which it flows. When it rolls along as a brook or a\r\nriver it is no doubt attacking in this way the rocks and stones of\r\nits channel, though this action is not very strikingly shown. But\r\nsometimes the rusting or dissolving action of water is very evident.\r\nWhen it issues from a peat bog, for example, and is consequently\r\nhighly charged with acid, it will make a very great impression on any\r\nlimestones it may encounter; for as any schoolboy knows who has ever\r\nput a piece of chalk in vinegar, or in any of the stronger acids of\r\nthe school laboratory, all the limestones are peculiarly susceptible\r\nto this form of chemical attack. Peat-water eats into limestone\r\nrapidly, while the limestone above the stream escapes, though it is\r\na little (and much more slowly) dissolved by rain. Hence arise some\r\ncurious features in the scenery of limestone districts. The walls of\r\nlimestone above the water are not eaten away so fast as their base\r\nover which the water flows. Consequently they are undermined and are\r\nsometimes cut into tunnels and caverns and caves.\r\n\r\nThe rivers carry away the dissolved material. The carbonate of lime\r\nis taken to the sea; and this substance, of which sea shells, for\r\nexample, are principally formed, is constantly supplied to the sea\r\nby the rivers that transport it from the land. The rivers of Western\r\nEurope have been known to convey one part of dissolved mineral matter\r\nin every 5000 parts of water, and of this mineral matter one half is\r\ncarbonate of lime. The Rhine alone bears enough carbonate of lime\r\nto the sea every year to make 332,000,000,000 oyster shells of the\r\nusual size. The Thames conveys 180,000 tons of sulphate of lime past\r\nLondon every year. It has been computed that more than 8,000,000 tons\r\nof dissolved mineral matter are removed from the rocks of England\r\nand Wales in one year. That is equivalent to a general lowering of\r\nthe surface of the country, by chemical solution alone, at the rate\r\nof one foot in 13,000 years. That is not much, it may seem; but in a\r\nmillion years, which is not a long period in geological time, half\r\nthe present towns of England would be sunk under water by this cause\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nRECORDS LEFT BY RIVERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we come to examine more closely the work which rivers do in\r\nremoving mineral substances from the land by washing particles\r\nof them from the surface, we find that the records they leave in\r\ngeological history must be plainly marked. Every stream, large or\r\nsmall, is always busy carrying mud, sand, or gravel. Rivers are the\r\n\"navvies\" of geology. When they are swollen by rain they sweep large\r\nstones away with them. If we look at the bed of a mountain torrent\r\nwe shall often see huge blocks of stone that have fallen from the\r\ncliffs on either side blocking the pathway of the stream. To all\r\nappearance the stream is quite powerless to remove these blocks,\r\nand has to circumnavigate them. But visit such a torrent when the\r\nsnows are melting, or heavy rain has fallen, and you will hear the\r\nstones knocking against each other or on the rocky bottom as they are\r\ndriven downwards by the flood. It is not easy to estimate the driving\r\npower of water. M. Gustave le Bon has furnished an illustration of\r\nits power which is very curious. In the south of France a stream\r\nis led downwards from the mountains to drive the turbine of some\r\nmachinery at a manufactory. It comes down several thousand feet. In\r\nthe manufactory there is a vent-hole, out of which the water can be\r\nallowed to shoot. The vent-hole is about an inch in diameter; and the\r\nwater rushes out with such swiftness and force that the water-jet\r\nbecomes as rigid as steel. It is impossible to cut through this\r\nwater-jet; and if any one were to try to do so with a sword, the\r\nsword might break but it could never pierce or pass through those\r\nswiftly moving particles of water. A more commonplace illustration is\r\nthe use that is sometimes made of water-jets to break up the surfaces\r\nof rock in quarries; nor must it be forgotten that horse-power of\r\ngreat value and extent for electric lighting and other purposes is\r\nalways being drawn from waterfalls. Thus as a mechanical force merely\r\nthe river can be immensely powerful; and must leave marks of its\r\npower on the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of its force with which we are, however, most concerned is\r\nthat which is directed to lowering gradually the surface of the land.\r\nIn the last chapter we showed how much mineral might be dissolved\r\nin the waters of rivers. If we are to include also the amount of\r\nmud, sand, and other things classed altogether as silt which a river\r\ncarries down, the figures become much more imposing. Sir Archibald\r\nGeikie says that, taking the Mississippi as a typical river (it is\r\nas good an example as would be found, because in its great length\r\nit passes through many different kinds of land, soil, and climate),\r\nwe may assume that the average amount of sediment carried down by a\r\nriver is one part of sediment to every 1500 parts of water.\r\n\r\nIf now, says he, we assume that all over the world this is the amount\r\ncarried down, we can see how seriously the level of the land is\r\nlowered by rivers. The Mississippi carries from the land it drains\r\nevery year the 1/6000th part of a foot of rock. If we take the\r\ngeneral height of the land of the whole globe to be 2100 feet, and\r\nsuppose it to be continuously wasted at this rate, then the whole\r\ndry land would be carried into the sea in 12,600,000 years. Or if\r\nwe assume the average height of the continent of Europe to be 940\r\nfeet, and to be lowered by its rivers at the same rate, then the last\r\nvestige of Europe would have disappeared in 8,640,000 years. Such\r\nfigures are of course not exact; and it must always be remembered\r\nthat the rivers are merely robbing Peter to pay Paul, and whatever\r\nthey take away are always putting somewhere else, but we may learn\r\nfrom the foregoing considerations that the lowering of the land is\r\nmuch more rapid than is sometimes supposed. Another thing about the\r\nexcavating work of rivers has to be remembered. The torrents carry\r\nsand, shingle, and rock with them, and these very materials act as\r\nagents of destruction on the beds of the water-courses. If we want\r\nto polish brass or steel we mix emery powder (or something finer or\r\ncoarser) with the polishing liquid. The torrent or river uses sand\r\nor shingle as its polishing powder. It then wears out the rock over\r\nwhich it travels, and sometimes carves it into holes or caverns,\r\ngorges or ravines. Sometimes the process is varied, as when a stream\r\nfinds its way over a hard rock which overlies a softer rock. If the\r\narrangement is like that of a series of steps (there may be only one\r\nor two steps) it is possible for the river as it foams in a waterfall\r\nover the hard step at the top to eat its way into the lower softer\r\nstep. The lower softer step will gradually disappear, and then the\r\nwaterfall, still eating its way in, will begin to undermine the hard\r\ntop step, and when that has gone on long enough the hard top step\r\nwill fall down and the waterfall will have to begin a little farther\r\nup the stream. In this way a waterfall, gorge, or ravine can be\r\nconstructed by a river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nThe Grand Cañon of Arizona\r\n\r\nThe Colorado River at this point is nearly 200 feet wide. The man\r\nis seated about 1200 feet above the river's level. This whole cañon\r\nup to the top of the mountains in the distance has been worn away\r\nby prehistoric current; and the river has gradually cut its bed\r\ndeeper.]\r\n\r\nThe Falls of Niagara are an illustration of this method. The river\r\nflows from Lake Erie through a level country for a few miles, then\r\nbegins to go faster as the path becomes steeper, and finally plunges\r\nover a hard limestone precipice. Beneath the hard limestone (the top\r\nstep) are softer beds of shale and sandstone. As the water eats into\r\nthem and removes them, large portions of the face of the limestone\r\nprecipice on the top fall into the stream below. Thus gradually the\r\nFalls of Niagara are eating their way back to Lake Erie, and have\r\nbeen doing so for hundreds of thousands of years. In the process of\r\ndoing so the Niagara River has cut out below the Falls a gorge which\r\nis not less than seven miles long, from two hundred to four hundred\r\nyards wide, and from two hundred to three hundred feet deep. There\r\nis no reason to doubt that the Niagara gorge has been entirely cut\r\nout in this way, and that at first the river fell over cliffs seven\r\nmiles farther down its course at Queenstown. The amount of rock thus\r\ntunnelled would make a rampart about twelve feet high and six feet\r\nthick going round the world at the Equator. Still more gigantic are\r\nthe gorges or caverns of the Colorado and its tributaries in Western\r\nAmerica. The Grand Cañon of the Colorado is three hundred miles long,\r\nand in some places more than six thousand feet deep. The country\r\ntraversed by it is a network of deep ravines, at the bottom of which\r\nflow the streams that have dug themselves down from the top of the\r\nColorado tableland.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that the river has dug itself in as far as it can go.\r\nThere must be a limit, and the limit is reached when the slope of\r\nthe bed has been made so slight that the current can only go on\r\nlanguidly. In that case it cannot sweep along stones, or shingle,\r\nor even coarse gravel; and then the river so far from deepening\r\nits channel begins to raise it by allowing more of the transported\r\nsediment to settle down. If a fast stream meets a slower one\r\ndeposition of material will take place; and the same thing will\r\noccur when the rivers meet a lake or a sea. Whatever checks the\r\nswiftness of a current weakens its carrying power and causes it to\r\ndrop some of its sediment to the bottom. Therefore accumulations of\r\nsediment occur at the foot of torrent slopes along the lower and\r\nmore level ground. These deposits we call alluvium, and sometimes\r\nwhen the mountain torrent ends abruptly in the plain they may stand\r\nup in cones of silt. They are sometimes called _alluvium cones_ or\r\n_fans_. Quitting the steep descents, and reinforced by tributaries on\r\neither side, the stream ceases to be a torrent and becomes a river.\r\nIt goes fast enough at first to carry still coarse gravel; but the\r\nbig angular blocks of rock have been dropped, and the stones it now\r\nleaves in its bed are smaller, and become rounded and smoothed as it\r\ngoes farther and farther across the plain. At many places it deposits\r\ngravel or sand, more especially at the inner side of the curves which\r\nthe stream makes as it winds down the valley. When the stream runs\r\nlow in summer, strips of bare sand and shingle are seen at each of\r\nthese bends; and the stones are always well smoothed and lie on the\r\nwhole regularly. Those that are oblong are so placed that the greater\r\nlength of the stone points across the stream; those that are flat\r\nusually slope upstream. These facts, though apparently insignificant,\r\nare really of importance, because they point to us a method by which\r\ngeology can determine, after a river has disappeared, the slope of\r\nthe bed and the direction of the curves which once it had. If we\r\nexamine the steep banks or cliffs by the side of a river the layers\r\nof gravel or shingle in the strata may be found to lie not flat on\r\none another but in sloping planes. That at once will furnish a clue\r\nto the direction of the river. Another thing of great importance\r\nare the terraces which a river forms by the side of itself. When it\r\noverflows in floods it deposits mud on either side, and when after\r\nthe flood it subsides the mud is left. If the reader will imagine\r\nthe river in the course of ages sinking lower into its bed he will\r\nsee that successive eras of flood-levels will leave their mark in a\r\nseries of steps, or _river terraces_ as they are called, on either\r\nside of the channel.\r\n\r\nBut besides the stones and gravel and mud carried down by a river, we\r\nmust also consider the fate of the remains of plants and animals that\r\nare swept along by it, especially in flood-time. In any ordinary\r\nflood trees and shrubs, and the smaller animals like mice and moles\r\nand rabbits, are drowned by the flood. In greater floods birds and\r\neven large animals are drowned, and their remains are buried in\r\nthe sediment. If they are quite covered over they may perhaps be\r\npreserved, and their bones may last for an indefinite period. If,\r\nfurther, the mud deposit hardens, these remains may be preserved so\r\nwell and so long that they become the fossil records of creatures\r\nwhich lived before man emerged to dwell in the world and to become\r\nthe arbiter of many of its destinies.\r\n\r\nWhat we have said of rivers is true also of lakes. Rivers pour\r\ninto lakes, bringing with them, especially in flood-time, enormous\r\nfreights of gravel, sand, and mud, and mingled with them the remains\r\nof vegetation and of animal life. Hundreds of thousands of tons may\r\nbe swept down by one storm. To the Lake of Lucerne, for example, the\r\nRiver Reuss, which comes down from the St. Gothard, brings seven\r\nmillion cubic feet of sediment every year with it. Since the time of\r\nthe Romans the Rhone has so filled up part of the Lake of Geneva that\r\nthe Roman harbour, Port Valais, is now nearly two miles from the edge\r\nof the lake. The ground between it and the Lake first became marsh.\r\nIt is now farm land. And though these accumulations are most marked\r\nwhere the rivers drain into the lake, there are deposits always\r\ntaking place from the hills all round the lake. Thus lake bottoms\r\nbecome most interesting and valuable receptacles of the life that has\r\nfor ages lived by or near their shores. These deposits are in many\r\nways peculiar. The snails that live in lake waters are distinct from\r\nthe land snails of the adjoining shores. Their dead shells gather at\r\nthe bottom of some lakes in such numbers as to form there a deposit\r\nof white crumbling _marl_, sometimes many yards in thickness. On the\r\nsites of lakes that have been gradually filled up, or artificially\r\ndrained, this marl shows at once where the lake borders were, and,\r\nroughly, the period of the lake. In some lakes also are found\r\nconcretions of iron-oxide, which are formed by the chemical action\r\nof the water on some of the rocks by the lake-side; and in several\r\nSwedish lakes this ironstone forms so fast that the lakes are\r\nregularly dredged for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nCleopatra Terrace, with its Mirror-like Pools, Yellowstone Park,\r\nU.S.A.\r\n\r\nThese beautiful basins are formed of incrustations of volcanic\r\nlimestone. They are of all colours: pink, orange-yellow, green,\r\nand blue. The water in them is of a brilliant blue, caused by the\r\ngrowth of water plants (algæ), which live in water with as high a\r\ntemperature as 150 F.]\r\n\r\nThus among the rocks which form the dry lands of the globe there\r\noccur masses of limestone, sand, marl, and other materials which we\r\nknow were deposited in lakes, because they contain types of plants\r\nand animals like those found in the lakes of our own time. From this\r\nkind of evidence we can mark out the places of great lakes that have\r\nlong ago vanished from the face of Europe and North America.\r\n\r\nThere are also the so-called Salt Lakes to consider. These are\r\ngenerally the lakes that have no outlet and into which a small\r\namount of water now flows, but never enough to cause the lake now to\r\noverflow, whatever it may have done in past times. The water that\r\nnow runs in escapes merely by evaporation. But just as the bottom of\r\na kettle in which hard water is constantly boiled gradually becomes\r\nfurred, so a lake bottom into which water is continually pouring,\r\nbringing dissolved in it all sorts of mineral salts, becomes coated\r\nwith sediment. The mineral salts are not evaporated, consequently\r\nthe lakes become gradually more mineral--or, for convenience, let us\r\nsay, become salter. Among the mineral salts common salt and gypsum\r\nare most important; but some bitter lakes contain sodium carbonate\r\nor magnesium chloride. The Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake of Utah\r\nshow by the deposits round them how they have changed their shape\r\nand depth. In the upper terraces of the Great Salt Lake, 1000 feet\r\nabove the present level of the water, fresh-water shells occur,\r\nshowing that the basin was at first fresh. The valley bottoms around\r\nsalt lakes are now crusted with gypsum, salt, or other deposits,\r\nand their waters are without sign of life. Such conditions help us\r\nto understand how great deposits of salt or gypsum were once laid\r\ndown in England, Poland, and Germany, and in many other places where\r\nnow the climate would not permit of the necessary evaporation and\r\ncondensation of the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nA Petrified Tree\r\n\r\nThis magnificent fossil is in the Petrified Forest of Arizona; and it\r\naffords one of the most striking examples known of the solidification\r\nand petrifaction of material by the infiltration of mineral salts.\r\nThe trunk is now not merely encrusted with stone: it is permeated by\r\nsilica, and is, in fact, itself a stone as hard as flint.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nRECORDS LEFT BY THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the story which the sea writes in the\r\nannals of geology. It is a story with two plots. In the first place,\r\nthe sea is always wearing away the land. In the second place, it is\r\narranging on its own bed the materials which it takes from the land,\r\neither directly or indirectly. As a sequel to both stories, the\r\nmaterials all neatly ranged, packed, and folded are revealed when the\r\nsea subsides from them, or when, in process of one of those great\r\ngeological changes, the origin of which we have already attempted\r\nto account for, the sea bottom is raised to become the land of a\r\ncontinent. The first part of the sea's belligerent story is written\r\nso plainly for all eyes to see that one scarcely need dwell on it.\r\nEvery strip of coast around these islands bears witness to it.\r\n\r\nOff Shetland masses of rock twelve or thirteen tons in weight have\r\nbeen cut out from the cliff seventy feet above the smooth-water\r\nlevel. The sea's battering-rams are the masses of shingle, gravel,\r\nand loose blocks of stone which it carries with it; but it has\r\nsubtler methods in the corrosive action of its salts, for just as it\r\nrusts or wears away iron, so its salts and acids must eat their way\r\ninto many rocks.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the coast-line of the world is a small fraction of\r\nthe whole land surface of the globe; and a smaller fraction of the\r\nsea's own wide area. On that area are flung all the records and\r\ntreasures which the sea has wrested from the land. The rivers, as\r\nwe have already several times repeated, are the chief carriers of\r\ndeposits to the sea. By their deltas they may be known. The deltas of\r\nthe Ganges and Brahmaputra cover an area as large as that of England\r\nand Wales. The delta has been bored through to a depth of nearly five\r\nhundred feet, and has been found to consist of numerous alternations\r\nof fine clays, marls, and sands or sandstones, with occasional layers\r\nof gravel. In all this accumulation of sediment there are no traces\r\nof marine animals; but land plants and the plants and animals of the\r\nriver and of the surrounding land have been discovered in quantity.\r\nThe sea most often destroys land; but it sometimes deposits beaches;\r\nand, we might almost say, silts up the land. At Romney Marsh, for\r\nexample, a tract of eighty square miles which was marsh in Julius\r\nCæsar's time is now dry land, and has become so partly by the natural\r\nincrease of shingle thrown up by the waves. The coarsest shingle\r\nusually accumulates towards the upper part of the beach, and the rest\r\narranges itself generally according to size and weight, that which is\r\nfinest being nearest to low-water mark.\r\n\r\nIt is often long before the stuff brought down by the rivers settles\r\non the floor of the ocean. The finer particles may be carried out to\r\nsea for three hundred miles or more before they settle. Within this\r\nthree-hundred-mile zone the land-derived materials are distributed\r\nover the floor in orderly succession. Nearer the land we shall find\r\ncoarse gravel and sand. Beyond there will be tracts of finer sand\r\nand silt, with patches of gravel here and there. Still farther off\r\nwill come fine blue and green muds, which are made of the tiny\r\nparticles of such materials as form the ordinary rocks of the land.\r\nBut when we are once past this zone of land material we come upon\r\ndeposits which are the ocean's own freehold--materials which it does\r\nnot derive from the continents, but which may be called oceanic in\r\norigin. First there are vast sheets of exceedingly fine red and brown\r\nclay. Whence comes it? It is by far the most common deposit in all\r\nthe deeper parts of the ocean. It may either be the dust of volcanic\r\nfragments washed away from volcanic islands, or (which is much more\r\nlikely) it may be supplied by eruptions under the sea. For it must\r\nbe remembered that the sea floor is two to five miles nearer the hot\r\nrocks that are in the interior of the earth than the land surface is,\r\nand that consequently the water coming into contact with them may\r\ncause explosions arising from the action of steam. This is a question\r\nwe shall have to consider later, and for the present we must ask the\r\nreader to accept the fact--and read on.\r\n\r\nThere is one very curious thing about this red clay, and it is that\r\nthe accumulations of it appear to be built up very slowly. Where it\r\noccurs farthest from land great numbers of sharks' teeth with ear\r\nbones and other bones of whales have been dredged up from it. Some\r\nof these relics are quite fresh; others are coated with a crust of\r\nbrown peroxide of manganese. Some are covered with this material and\r\nhidden in it. One haul of an ocean dredge will bring up the bones in\r\nall these states, so that they must be lying side by side. The bones\r\nare probably those of many generations of animals, and it must take a\r\nlong time to cover them with the manganese deposit. But the clay is\r\ndeposited even more slowly than the manganese, so that it must fall\r\nvery slowly indeed.\r\n\r\nBut besides these things the bottom of the sea receives deposits of\r\nthe remains of all kinds of shells, corals, and all sorts of marine\r\ncreatures, great and small. As the countless myriads of the animals\r\nof the sea die, the shells with which they are covered, or the bones\r\nwhich form their framework, fall continually to the bottom of the\r\noceanic gulfs in which they dwell. Then the ocean floor is covered\r\nwith the remains of tiny animals incomparably more numerous than the\r\nstars of the sky; and this grey slimy ooze of organic matter hardens\r\nby pressure into sedimentary rock. In the course of ages, when the\r\nslow decline of the water lays it bare, it may become part of the\r\nland on which men dwell. But it is always forming, has always been\r\nforming, since life first appeared on the earth. It is on this ocean\r\nfloor that man to-day lays his telegraph cables. Mr. Rudyard Kipling,\r\nin his verses \"The Deep Sea Cables,\" has drawn a vivid picture of the\r\nbed of the deep ocean:--\r\n\r\n  The wrecks dissolve above us: their dust drops down from afar--\r\n  Down to the dark, to the utter dark where the blind white\r\n      sea-snakes are.\r\n  There is no sound, no echo of sound, in the deserts of the deep,\r\n  On the great grey level plains of ooze, where the shell-burred\r\n      cables creep.\r\n\r\nIt is in these silent depths that for uncounted and innumerable\r\nyears the crust of the earth has been forming and has been growing\r\noutwards, while it has been slowly hardening inwards above the fires\r\nof its unplumbed interior.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that in a square mile of the ocean down to\r\na depth of one hundred fathoms there exist more than sixteen tons\r\nof carbonate of lime in the form of the bones or shells of living\r\nanimals. A continual fine \"snow-storm\" of dead chalky animals is\r\ntherefore falling on to the bottom. Here and there, especially among\r\nvolcanic islands, portions of the sea-bed have been raised up into\r\nland and masses of modern limestone. Though these rocks are full of\r\nthe same kinds of shells as are still living in the neighbouring sea,\r\nthey have been cemented into hard rock. This cementing is due to\r\nthe water which has penetrated and permeated the stone, dissolving\r\nchalky matter from the outside shells, and depositing it once more\r\nlower down and farther in, like a fine mortar, so as to bind the mass\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of coral reefs. They are one of the best and most\r\nfamiliar examples of the way in which great masses of solid rock\r\ncan be built up by the dead bodies of animals. In the warmer seas\r\nof the earth, and notably in the track of the great ocean currents,\r\nvarious kinds of coral polyps, as they are called, take root on the\r\nedges and summits of submerged rocks and peaks, as well as on the\r\nshelving shores of islands. The coral polyp is a jelly-like creature,\r\nbut it has a hard chalky skeleton inside its transparent body. It is\r\na great colonist, with no liking for a solitary life, but with, on\r\nthe contrary, a great fancy for its neighbours; in fact, the polyps\r\ngrow and thrive in clumps, and the clumps unite to form communities,\r\nand the communities increase to colonies and nations, till they unite\r\nto form what is called a reef. The coral polyps are rather exigent\r\nin the choice of their residential neighbourhoods. They cannot live\r\nat a greater depth than fifteen or twenty fathoms, and in defiance\r\nof the inclinations which rule human beings, they have the strongest\r\ndistaste for sun and air; in fact, they die when exposed to it.\r\n\r\nNow when the polyp dies its skeleton remains behind it, and millions\r\nupon millions of these coral skeletons make a layer of coral. These\r\nlayers of coral gradually lift the generations of polyps upwards to\r\nthe surface of the water. But as we have seen, the living polyps\r\ndie when they get so far, and consequently the reef then spreads\r\noutwards. On the outer edges of the reef the coral polyps flourish in\r\nthe most vigorous way. There they are as completely provided for as\r\nin a County Council Utopia. The breakers bring them the food on which\r\nthey live; the water and the climate suit them exactly. The only blot\r\non their lives are the occasional storms which break off fragments of\r\nthe coral foundation on which they live. But even this, while it is\r\ndisastrous to the individual polyp, is for the good of the community,\r\nbecause these blocks as they roll down form a new foundation on\r\nwhich new generations of polyps can grow and feed. Moreover, it is\r\nbetter for the polyp to take the risks of these evictions than to\r\nvegetate _inside_ the reef, for there in the calmer water he will\r\nnot have enough to eat, and will dwindle and die. Thus the tendency\r\nof all reefs must be to grow seawards, and to increase in breadth.\r\nPerhaps their breadth may tell us roughly how old they are. But there\r\nis another possibility to be taken into consideration, which is that\r\nwhile the polyps are building the sea bottom or island foundation may\r\nbe slowly sinking. In that case it is quite likely that the coral\r\nbuilders might just keep pace with the subsiding foundations of\r\ntheir home, and build up a great thickness of coral rock during the\r\ncountless years of change.\r\n\r\nSir Archibald Geikie has called attention to the swiftness with\r\nwhich the structure of the coral polyp's skeleton is effaced from\r\nthe foundation and a compact mass of rock put in its place. The\r\nsea-water's chemical and dissolving action, and the vast amount of\r\nmud and sand produced by the breakers are chiefly responsible for\r\nthis. As the rock is being formed it is always being cemented. On\r\nthe portion of a reef laid dry at low water, the coral rock looks in\r\nmany places as solid and old as some of the ancient white limestones\r\nand marbles of the land. In pools where a current of water keeps the\r\ngrains of coral sand in motion, each grain may be seen to be rounded.\r\nThis is because on each particle of coral the dissolved carbonate of\r\nlime in the water is always being deposited (like the sediment in the\r\nbottom of a kettle). A mass of these rounded or egg-like grains all\r\ngathered together in a lump is called _oolite_, from the Greek word\r\n\"oon\" (Latin \"ovum\"), an egg. In many limestones, now forming parts\r\nof agricultural land, this _oolitic_ structure is strikingly shown,\r\nand there can be no doubt that in such cases it was produced just as\r\nnow coral reefs are being formed before our eyes. In the coral tracts\r\nof the Pacific Ocean there are nearly three hundred coral islands,\r\nbesides extensive reefs round volcanic islands. Others occur in the\r\nIndian Ocean. Coral reefs abound in the West Indian seas, where in\r\nmany of the islands they have been upraised into dry land--in Cuba\r\nto a height of 1100 feet above the sea-level. The Great Barrier Reef\r\nthat fronts the north-eastern coast of Australia is 1250 miles long\r\nand from ten to ninety miles broad.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that, apart from any other consideration, the\r\nanimals of past ages leave permanent records of their existence\r\nmerely by the accumulation of their dead bodies. Nevertheless, alike\r\non land and on sea, the proportions of organic remains thus sealed\r\nand preserved is only a small part of the total population of plants\r\nand animals living at any given time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCOLD AND ICE ON THE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe astronomers who look at the planet Mars tell us that at the\r\nNorthern and Southern Poles there are great areas of snow, very much\r\ngreater than the arctic regions of the earth, for the south polar\r\narea alone occupies 11,330,000 square miles. But the geological\r\nrecords of the earth show that our own arctic regions once extended\r\nvery much farther than they do at present, a fact which need not in\r\nany way surprise us, for as we have already remarked, snow and ice\r\nare very largely a matter of the nearness of the sea to the land.\r\nWe may put the same thing in another way by saying that winter\r\ncold and summer heat depend largely on the distribution of sea and\r\nland. Thus Venice, which is not very much farther from the North\r\nPole than Vladivostok, has an altogether different climate, and\r\ninhabitants of the Shetland Isles have a very different kind of\r\nclimatic experience from those who delve by the frozen Yukon. There\r\nis another consideration which is sometimes overlooked. We do not\r\nthink of the earth as a very warm body. But at its very coldest\r\npart, where the thermometer goes down to seventy or ninety degrees\r\nbelow freezing, it is several hundreds of degrees warmer than the\r\nspace outside the earth. Midway between the earth and the moon the\r\ntemperature must be 430° F. below freezing; so that if we take the\r\nsurface of the earth as a whole we may say that it is between four\r\nhundred and five hundred degrees warmer than the space by which it is\r\nsurrounded. Every one knows what is happening when he warms his hands\r\nat a fire. The fire being hotter than its surroundings is giving out\r\nheat towards them, and the hands catch some of this radiated heat.\r\nSimilarly the earth is radiating heat, and the atmosphere round the\r\nearth catches some of it. So also do the seas. While therefore it\r\nis certain that the heat of the sun warms the earth and the air and\r\nthe sea, and so gives rise to currents of air and perhaps of water,\r\nso also is it likely that the heat of the earth causes warm air to\r\nrise, and so plays its part in forming the winds, the currents of\r\nair, and the currents of water. When the earth was warmer than it is\r\nnow it had more and greater effects in this direction. It caused more\r\nevaporation of the water, more clouds, and therefore more rain, and\r\nin winter more snow.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, a period when there was very much more snow in winter\r\nthan now. As the snow accumulated layer on layer the lower part would\r\nbecome squeezed into a mass half ice, half snow; and it is quite\r\nlikely that the heat of the summer sun (especially if, as we have\r\nsupposed, the atmosphere was much cloudier then than now) would be\r\nunable to dissolve it. Thus the snow age would gradually merge into\r\nan ice age, and we can imagine a period when a great deal of Europe\r\nwas covered with snow or ice as Greenland is to-day. What records\r\nwould it leave behind? Now, on slopes the sheet of snow would tend to\r\nslip just as it slips from sloping house-roofs. In doing so it would\r\npush before it any loose material which lay in front of it; and trees\r\nor bushes, stone or soil, would be gradually pushed downhill. If the\r\nslopes were steep enough the snow-sheets would occasionally break\r\noff and sweep down as avalanches. Sometimes these great masses are\r\nmany thousands of square yards in area and fifty feet thick, and in\r\nthe late winter and early spring often do immense damage, carrying\r\naway houses, trees, and great masses of rocks in their progress. They\r\nleave their imprint not only in ground swept bare, but in huge mounds\r\nof debris piled up in the valleys below.\r\n\r\nBut when the snow has taken the form of a glacier its record is left\r\nin more unmistakable characters. Imagine a great mass of snow and\r\nice descending between the clefts of mountains to lower levels. As\r\nit slips slowly down its valley, like a very slow river--slower than\r\na river of thickest mud or pitch or lava would be--earth, sand, mud,\r\ngravel, boulders, and masses of rock sometimes are washed down on its\r\nsurface from the slopes on either side. Avalanches will occasionally\r\nbring other contributions. Nearly all this rubbish accumulates on\r\nthe edges of the glacier nearest the slopes, and it is slowly borne\r\nto the journey's end on the glacier's shoulders. Some of it falls\r\ninto rents or crevasses in the ice, and may be imprisoned there and\r\ncarried down as an inside passenger, or it may reach the rocky floor\r\nover which the ice is sliding. Its progress then resembles that of\r\nthe Irish gentleman who was travelling in a Sedan chair out of which\r\nthe seat and the bottom had fallen, and who said that if 'twere not\r\nfor the fashion of the thing he'd as lief walk. The rubbish borne\r\nonward on the surface of the glacier is known as _moraine-stuff_,\r\nand the mounds of it at the edge of the glacier are called _lateral\r\nmoraines_. Where two glaciers unite like two rivers, their moraines,\r\nright-hand and left-hand, will join, and in the new glacier a new\r\nmoraine will appear running down the middle, and so called a _medial\r\nmoraine_. Where a glacier has many tributaries bearing a good deal\r\nof moraine-stuff, its surface may be like a bare plain so covered\r\nwith stones that the ice beneath can hardly be discerned except here\r\nand there. At the end of the glacier where the ice melts, the heaps\r\nof stones, ever adding to their numbers, are deposited in heaps, to\r\nwhich are given the name of the _terminal moraine_.\r\n\r\nWith such tokens of their existence as this, glaciers, as will\r\nreadily be understood, leave visiting-cards in history that cannot\r\neasily be mistaken. Even existing glaciers tell strange stories.\r\nNowadays glaciers are carefully measured and examined both in\r\nSwitzerland and in Canada. During the last decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury and the first decade of the twentieth the Swiss glaciers\r\nwere found to show signs of receding farther up their valleys. The\r\nsame thing has been observed about some of the Canadian glaciers.\r\nThere are several plausible reasons for this. Professor Schaeberle\r\nsays that the earth is growing cooler, and that in the temperate\r\nregions the winter rainfall (which would turn to falls of snow\r\nin the mountains) is less than it has been. It is certain that a\r\nshortage of winter rain over a number of years in succession would\r\naccount for the shrinkage of the glaciers, but it is not by any\r\nmeans certain that a number of dry winters will not be followed by\r\nwet ones, in which case the glaciers would increase again. Some of\r\nthe glaciers show that during their existence they have shrunk and\r\nlengthened alternately like gutta-percha in a variable climate. How\r\ndo we know that they have shrunk and lengthened? The _moraines_ of\r\nwhich we have spoken give us the testimony. As a glacier shrinks\r\neither in length or in breadth and depth it leaves the blocks of\r\nrock at its edges stranded on the sides of the valley. Such perched\r\nblocks or _erratics_ are the best of glacier marks, and their great\r\nsize, some of them as large as a cheap villa residence, is such that\r\nno current of water could have brought them there. They are often\r\npoised on the tops of crags, on the very edges of precipices, or on\r\nsteep slopes, where they could never have been left by any flood,\r\neven had the flood been able to move them. The only thing that could\r\nhave carried them must have been a vehicle that moved very, very\r\nslowly and deposited them very, very gently--in fact, glacier ice.\r\nWe can see blocks like this on the glaciers now, and others stranded\r\nat the sides. In the Swiss valleys the scattered ice-borne boulders\r\nmay be seen by hundreds far above the glaciers and far beyond the\r\nplaces where the glaciers end. We _know_ they must have been left\r\nby glaciers, and by inference we surmise that when we find a valley\r\nfilled with them, then, though the valley may have no glacier now,\r\nit must have once been occupied by one.\r\n\r\nThese erratic blocks, now found all over Europe, tell us a good deal\r\nabout the ice on which they were transported. The blocks that fall\r\non the edges of the glacier remain on the side where they descend.\r\nHence, if there is any notable difference in the composition of the\r\nrocks on either side of the valley, the existence of this difference\r\nwill be preserved in the _moraines_. If, therefore, in a country\r\nwhere the glaciers have disappeared we can trace the scattered\r\nblocks up to their sources among the mountains, we can say what was\r\nthe track followed by the prehistoric glaciers. In Europe there are\r\nseveral examples of the uses of this detective evidence. Thus the\r\npeculiar blocks of the Valais mountains can be traced right on to\r\nLyons; and this shows us that the glacier from which the River Rhone\r\nsprang extended once right across the east of France to Lyons, and\r\nprobably farther. It was therefore once at least 170 miles longer.\r\nSimilarly, blocks which are exactly like the characteristic rocks\r\npeculiar to Southern Scandinavia are found in Northern Germany,\r\nBelgium, and East Anglia; and we therefore believe that a great sheet\r\nof ice once filled up the Baltic and the German Ocean, carrying with\r\nit immense numbers of northern \"erratics.\" In our own country, in\r\nfact, glacier boulders are found in nearly every county, and show\r\nthat once the greater part of the country was buried under ice.\r\n\r\nBut, as we have said, it is not only on its shoulders, but in its\r\ninterior and beneath its base that a glacier rolls and pushes its\r\nrubbish along. It is not all stones. Clay and earth mingle with\r\nit, often enclosing the stones; and the debris left by extinct\r\nglaciers of ages ago is sometimes called the boulder-clay. This is\r\nthe deposit, earthy and stony, that the glacier leaves on the floor\r\nof the valley as it shrinks--unless the river which usually springs\r\nfrom the end of glaciers sweeps it away. Most of the stones thus left\r\nare smoothed or polished and covered with scratches or ruts, such\r\nas would be made by rubbing against other hard pointed fragments of\r\nstone. This is to be explained by the fact that these stones as they\r\nwere carried on by the glacier were rubbed on the floor of rock over\r\nwhich the glacier was slipping. If their journey was long enough,\r\nthey stood a chance of being rubbed away altogether and of finishing\r\ntheir existence as sand or mud. What the valley did to the glacier's\r\nstones, the stones did to the valley. They scratched it and scored\r\nit. Every promontory of rock which stood in the path of the ice had\r\nits angles and corners ground away. The polish and the directions of\r\nthe scratches are especially remarkable, because, whether the marks\r\nare mere lines or deep-worn ruts, they are all on smooth surfaces,\r\nand they all run one way. That way is the direction in which the\r\nglacier moved. How high a degree of polish or how deep the markings\r\nmay be depends a good deal on the kind of rock over which the glacier\r\nmoved. Tough, close-grained rocks, such as hard limestone, are\r\nsometimes polished to look like marble. But there is a great deal of\r\ndifference between the smoothing effected by a river or a torrent and\r\nthat which is produced by a glacier, because the river tosses the\r\nrocks and stones in all directions, polishes them on every side, and\r\nleaves no distinctive parallel scratches or grooves on them. That can\r\nonly be done by glaciers which hold the rocks, the rubbers and the\r\nrubbed, pressed firmly together and grind them continually in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nThese scratchings or striations of rocks, the smoothed and grooved\r\nsurfaces, and the deposited boulder-clay and boulders enable us to\r\ntrace the march of great ice-sheets over regions of the earth which\r\nare now of totally different aspect. From this kind of evidence\r\nwe have been able to find that the whole of Northern Europe was\r\nonce buried under a great expanse of snow and ice. The sheet was,\r\nas we should expect, thickest in the north and west, and thinned\r\naway southward and eastward. Over Scandinavia it was between 6000\r\nand 7000 feet in thickness--as we can tell from the scratches on\r\nthe sides of the high mountains. Similar marks 3000 feet above the\r\nsea-level in the Scottish Highlands lead us to believe that over\r\nScotland the glaciers were 5000 feet thick, and even as far south as\r\nthe Hartz Mountains in Germany it could not have been far short of\r\n1500 feet in thickness. Imagine this great mass of ice ever slowly\r\nmoving and ever creeping solemnly down to the sea. By the markings\r\nit left we can trace where the greater glaciers slid grandly along.\r\nIn Scandinavia it swept westwards to the Atlantic and eastwards to\r\nthe Gulf of Bothnia, then frozen as solid as the Pole. Southward the\r\nice ground its way across Denmark to the Low Countries and North\r\nGermany. The Baltic was choked with ice, and so was the North Sea\r\nas far south as London. Ice in that day flowed in glaciers from the\r\nBritish Isles, eastwards from Scotland into the hollow of the North\r\nSea, and westwards down all the clefts of the mountains, burying the\r\nwestern isles and breaking off in icebergs that drifted far into the\r\nAtlantic. Sir Archibald Geikie says that the western margin of the\r\nice-fields from the south-west of Ireland to the North Cape of Norway\r\nmust have presented a vast wall of ice 1200 to 1500 miles long and\r\nhundreds of feet high--like that great barrier which the Antarctic\r\nexplorers tell us frown on the waters that lap the boundaries of\r\nthe south polar land. Northern Europe must have been like North\r\nGreenland of to-day. The rock scratches tell us (since even the\r\nsouthern coast of Ireland is intensely ice-worn) that the edge of\r\nice must have extended some distance beyond Cape Clear, rising out\r\nof the sea with a precipitous front that faced to the south. Thence\r\nthe ice-cliff swung eastwards, passing probably along the line of the\r\nBritish Channel and keeping to the north of the valley of the Thames.\r\nIts southern margin ran across what is now Holland and skirted the\r\nhigh grounds of Westphalia, Hanover, and the Hartz Mountains--which\r\nprobably barred its further progress southward. \"There is evidence\r\nthat the ice swept round into the lowlands of Saxony up to the chain\r\nof the Erz, Riesen, and Sudenten Mountains, whence its southern limit\r\nturned eastward across Silesia, Poland, and Galicia, and then swung\r\nround to the north, passing across Russia by way of Kieff and Nijni\r\nNovgorod to the Arctic Ocean.\"\r\n\r\nIn North America there are similar traces of the great ice-sheet,\r\none of the branches of which streamed southward into the basin of\r\nthe Mississippi, the second moving westward from Hudson Bay to the\r\nRockies, and southward to Iowa, and the third setting out from the\r\ngreat mountain ranges of British Columbia. Right across North America\r\nto-day for thousands of miles stretch accumulations and mounds of\r\nrock which were pushed forward by the ice, and were dropped by the\r\nglaciers when they reached \"farthest south.\" These accumulations are\r\ncalled, from their origin, the great \"terminal moraines\" of the North\r\nAmerican Ice Age.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that these great ice-sheets of both\r\nhemispheres remained constant in extent and thickness. There were\r\nperiods of retreat and advance, of progress and shrinking, and the\r\nshrinkings of these took place on a large scale, and perhaps lasted\r\nfor hundreds or thousands of years; so that mixed with the strata\r\nof boulder-clay, which are the characteristic strata of the glacial\r\nperiods, are other strata of sand, ordinary clay, and even peat.\r\nRemains of plants and animals are found in these strata, showing\r\nthat sometimes the glaciers retreated so far and for so long that\r\nvegetation sprang up and animals lived on the ground that they had\r\ncovered--in the intervals when the cold of centuries was replaced by\r\nother centuries of mild and equable climate.\r\n\r\nAt last, after many of these swallow-like retreats and advances,\r\nthe warmer climate at length came to stay, and the ice retreated\r\nfarther and farther to the north. It still remained among the\r\nmountains, so that we might describe the glaciers of the Alps\r\nand of the Canadian Rockies as the last relics existing to-day of\r\nthe great Ice Age of the past. The retreat to the Arctic Circle\r\nleft many other relics behind it, the great lakes, for example,\r\nlike Winnipeg and Manitoba, and the Great Salt Lake of Utah. All\r\nwere once mightier sheets, because during the Ice Age their waters\r\nwere held back. Other smaller lakes formed by the dumping-heaps or\r\nterminal moraines of the glaciers still exist, and are especially\r\nnoticeable in Finland. During the later stages of the Ice Age the\r\nlevel of the land was lower than it is now in Western Europe. When\r\nthe ground began to rise--in slow upheavals with long pauses for\r\nrest--it left its impress in raised beaches, which can be seen on\r\nboth sides of Scotland and on the Norwegian coast. The climate grew\r\ngradually milder, the animals and the plants followed in the train of\r\nthe retreating ice, and even the traces of man's existence began to\r\nappear. The change was not sudden; it was so gradual that the Ice Age\r\nslipped as imperceptibly as its own glaciers into the age in which\r\nMan's activities in Europe began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRE-HARDENED ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far we have been considering the deposits laid down, for the most\r\npart, in a leisurely and orderly manner, by the action of air and\r\nwater; by floods, rivers, lakes, the sea, or by the slow movements\r\nof ice. If these, however, had been the only agents by which the\r\nearth's strata were accumulated, then it is clear that for the most\r\npart these deposits and these strata would lie evenly, one on top of\r\nthe other, like the lines of print on this page. But as a matter of\r\nobservation the earth's strata do not lie like that. If we were to\r\ntear this page out and crumple it up in a ball, first having torn it\r\nin half and shredded a few irregular pieces out of it, we should get\r\na truer picture of the way in which many of the earth's strata are\r\ncontorted, crumpled, and displaced. They have not been so distorted\r\nby the action of the sea, violent as are some of the sea's assaults\r\non the land; nor would the heat of the sun at its greatest ever\r\nproduce such effects. They must have taken place from some causes\r\nwhich arise in the earth itself. These causes can be summed up in one\r\nword--fire. Some of the strata of which we have spoken, and which\r\nare called sedimentary strata, although they were composed of soft\r\nmaterials to begin with, have become very hard since, in some cases\r\nowing to the enormous pressure of the accumulated deposits above\r\nthem, in other cases because of chemical action. In a few cases\r\nthey have become hardened not so much by losing their water, as by\r\ndirect heat. But the hardest of them is not so hard as another class\r\nof rocks with which we are all acquainted--rocks like granite, or\r\nquartz, or basalt. And it will be evident to any one who thinks about\r\nthe subject for a moment that no amount of pressure would make a\r\nrock as hard as a diamond. Now how have these rocks been made? The\r\nanswer is that they have been made in some interior furnace of heat\r\ndeep down in the earth. Sometimes they have boiled up, and we can\r\ntrace them bursting their way through the sedimentary strata above\r\nthem. We do not know very much about the furnaces or cauldrons whence\r\nthey have come; in fact, we know very little about the depths of\r\nthe earth. The deepest mine-shaft known is near Lake Superior, and\r\nis only 5000 feet in depth. In Silesia a bore-hole has been made by\r\nthe Austrian Government of a mile and a quarter in depth. It would\r\nbe by no means an easy task to sink a great boring. The Hon. Charles\r\nParsons has described some of the difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe shaft would have to be sunk in a neighbourhood where it would not\r\nbe likely to encounter water on its way down, because otherwise there\r\nwould be the necessity of pumping operations. In order to be of value\r\nfor purposes of observation, the shaft would be of the size usual\r\nin ordinary mines and coal-pits. It would be sunk in stages each of\r\nabout half a mile in depth, and at each stage there would be placed\r\nthe hauling and other machinery for dealing with the next stage\r\nbelow. This machinery, in order to economise space and limit the heat\r\nof the workings, would be electrical. Even so there would have to be\r\nspecial arrangements for cooling; and the depth of each stage in the\r\nboring would be restricted to half a mile in order to avoid great\r\ncost in the hauling arrangements, great weight of rope, and the great\r\ncost of keeping the machinery and workings cool. At each second or\r\nthird mile down there would be air-locks to prevent the air-pressure\r\nfrom becoming excessive, owing to the weight of the superincumbent\r\nair. For when we got between two and three miles down below the\r\nsurface of the earth the atmospheric pressure there would be double\r\nwhat it is at the earth's surface, or, therefore, about thirty pounds\r\nto the square inch. It would not be easy to work under greater\r\nair-pressure than that, firstly because of the strain on the workmen,\r\nand secondly because of the rise of temperature which this increased\r\nair-pressure would cause. Therefore special chambers would have to\r\nbe constructed to relieve the pressure, as well as special pumps to\r\nprovide ventilation, and other machinery to carry the superfluous\r\nheat to the surface. This last-named machinery would be of the nature\r\nof brine-filled pipes, in which a freezing mixture would always be\r\nkept circulating. (The arrangements suggested by Mr. Parsons for\r\nkeeping the underground workings cool are rather too complicated\r\nfor description here; but no doubt the means he suggests would be\r\neffective, and it would be possible, though with great difficulty, to\r\nkeep the workings cool.)\r\n\r\nWhen the borings extended to a depth of some miles it would be\r\nnecessary to freeze the bottom of the shaft. This is a thing which\r\nis sometimes now done when a shaft is being sunk through quicksands\r\nthat may be encountered on its way down. Round the circle of the\r\nmain shaft a number of small bore-holes are driven, and into them\r\nis poured very cold brine, which freezes the material through which\r\nthe shaft is to be driven. In the case of the great boring we are\r\nconsidering this would have to be done not only at the bottom of the\r\nshaft but also for some time on the newly pierced shaft sides, until\r\nthe surrounding rock has been cooled for some distance from the face.\r\n\r\nWhat would such a shaft cost? How long would it take to build? What\r\nwould the temperature be that it encountered on the way down? The\r\nfollowing is the estimate offered by Mr. Parsons:--\r\n\r\n                                          Cost    Time in  Temperature\r\n                                            £      Years     of Rock\r\n  For  2 miles depth from the surface     500,000    10       122° F.\r\n   \"   4      \"       \"       \"         1,100,000    25       152°\r\n   \"   6      \"       \"       \"         1,800,000    40       182°\r\n   \"   8      \"       \"       \"         2,700,000    55       212°\r\n   \"  10      \"       \"       \"         3,700,000    70       242°\r\n   \"  12      \"       \"       \"         5,000,000    85       272°\r\n\r\nBut this estimate does not include the cost of cooling the shaft or\r\nof providing it with air-locks. Mr. Parsons in delineating the scheme\r\nremarked on the vast amount of information with which such a boring\r\nwould furnish engineers, miners, and geologists; but the point that\r\nwe wish to make is that even with this enormous expenditure of time,\r\nindustry, and money we should be as far as ever from knowing anything\r\nabout the core of the earth. We should have only gone about a third\r\nof the way through what geologists call the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nHere, again, we are in a condition of difficulty. How thick is the\r\nearth's crust? and what is there beneath it? Well, as we are still\r\nsuch a long way from exploring it we can only give a rather doubtful\r\nanswer; and we must therefore try to show not only what is thought\r\nabout the earth's interior but why we think it. From Mr. Charles\r\nParsons' table it will be seen that he calculates that as the boring\r\nwent deeper it would find a higher and higher temperature among the\r\nrocks. At two miles down it would be hotter than the hottest summer's\r\nday at the earth's surface; at eight miles down water would boil\r\nby itself; at twelve miles down, unless the cooling arrangements\r\nwere extremely good, the workmen would die like flies. How does\r\nMr. Parsons know that there would be these temperatures, seeing\r\nthat the deepest boring hitherto made is only a mile? He bases his\r\ncalculations on what we know already of the ascending temperature at\r\ndeepening levels.\r\n\r\nFor ten years Professor Agassiz took observations concerning a very\r\ndeep mine in the United States called the Calumet and Hecla Mine.\r\nHe and Professor Chamberlin, after examining all the observations\r\nvery carefully, came to the conclusion that in going down from the\r\nearth's surface the temperature rose at a rate of about 1° of heat\r\n(Fahrenheit) for every 125 feet.\r\n\r\nAt the North Garden Gully Mine, Bendigo, Australia, and at the New\r\nChum Mine a temperature of 99° F. was reached at 3000 feet, and 107°\r\nat 3645 feet. The rate of increase of temperature was reckoned to be\r\n1° of heat (Fahrenheit) for every 80 feet.\r\n\r\nThis rate of 1° for 80 feet was also found at a South German mine,\r\nMaldon, as well as at a Ballarat mine, and at a mine near Port\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nIn a French mine more than 3000 feet deep, at the collieries of\r\nRonchamp, the rate of increase was as high as 1° in 50 feet.\r\n\r\nIn the North Staffordshire mines Mr. Atkinson, H.M. Inspector of\r\nMines, found the increase to be on the average 1° in 65 feet; whereas\r\nin the South Staffordshire Hamstead Colliery Mr. F. G. Meachem found\r\nthat the increase was 1° F. for every 110 feet. The same rate was\r\nobtained at the Baggeridge Wood Colliery, South Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nIn South Wales, in the neighbourhood of Rhondda and Aberdare, the\r\nrate is 1° for 95 feet; at Dowlais, in the Merthyr coalfield, it\r\nwas 1° in 93 feet; at the Niddrie Collieries, near Edinburgh, the\r\nincrease is at the rate of 1° in 99 feet.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that all over the world there is an increase of\r\ntemperature at a rate which, on the average, is about 1° for every\r\n100 feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile; therefore, if this rate of\r\nincreasing temperature were maintained, at a depth of 100 miles the\r\ntemperature would be perhaps 5000° F.; a temperature at which steel\r\nwould melt and boil away into vapour. At a depth of 200 miles the\r\nheat would be greater than that of the surface of the sun.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: According to the calculations made by the late Mr. W.\r\nE. Wilson, F.R.S., in Ireland, 5773° Centigrade above the lowest\r\ntemperature which is possible in space, or about 10,500° F.]\r\n\r\nNow at temperatures like that everything we know on the surface of\r\nthe earth would melt. Something else would happen to it besides that.\r\nThose of our readers who have ever seen experiments at the Royal\r\nInstitution in London by Sir James Dewar or Sir William Crookes will\r\nknow that if metals are made hot enough they will not only melt but\r\nwill boil away into vapour as water boils into steam. And perhaps\r\nwe need tell no one that air, if it be subjected to a low enough\r\ntemperature, can be made a solid like ice. In fact, everything in\r\nnature, whether we generally know it as a solid (like iron), or a\r\nliquid (like water), or a gas (like air), can be made to assume\r\neither of the two other forms. Thus the solid iron can be turned into\r\na liquid or a gas, and the liquid water can be turned into a gas\r\nby boiling, or into ice by freezing. The gaseous air can be turned\r\ninto a liquid by lowering its temperature to some 300° F. or more\r\nbelow the point at which water turns into ice; while if we lower the\r\ntemperature to about 390° F. below freezing, it will turn into a\r\nsolid. At a temperature of about 490° F. below freezing everything\r\nin nature, whether gaseous or liquid, would become a solid, and\r\nthat temperature, which is the lowest that can possibly exist, is\r\ncalled Absolute Zero. But just as every gas becomes a solid at that\r\ntemperature, so there are temperatures at which every solid becomes a\r\ngas. Gold, for instance, begins to be a liquid at about 1900° F., and\r\nif we heat it to 2000° it will become a gas.\r\n\r\nTherefore it will be seen that if we were to suppose that the earth\r\ngrew steadily hotter all the way down to its centre, we should\r\ncomparatively soon come to a point when everything would be trying\r\nto turn into a gas. But there is one other thing to be thought of.\r\nImagine what the pressure of the weight of the rocks themselves must\r\nbe. At a depth of a mile pressure from above arising from the weight\r\nof the overlying rock is about 6000 lb. to the square inch. At three\r\nmiles the weight has increased to 18,000 lb., at four miles to about\r\n24,000 lb., and at five miles to about 30,000 lb. to the square inch.\r\nNow the average strength required to crush rocks has been shown to\r\nbe about 25,000 lb. to the square inch for granite, for limestones\r\nabout 16,000 lb. to the square inch, and for the sandstones about\r\n6000 lb. to the square inch. At a depth of five miles, therefore, the\r\nweight above must be equal if not greater than the resisting power\r\nof the rock. What will happen lower than that? An experiment shown\r\nsome years ago by Sir William Roberts Austen at the Royal Institution\r\ngives us some idea of what might happen. He subjected iron to very\r\ngreat hydraulic pressure, and he arranged the experiment in such a\r\nway that the spectators could see an image of what was happening\r\nprojected by a beam of light on to a kind of magic-lantern screen.\r\nThe iron began to move like slowly melting pitch, or very thick\r\ngum. In fact, at depths of about six, seven, or eight miles, it is\r\nsupposed by many geologists that if the lower rocks had room to move\r\nthey would have a tendency to flow.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Geology: Earth History_, p. 127. Chamberlin and\r\nSalisbury.]\r\n\r\nSuppose, however, they cannot flow, that there is no room for them to\r\nflow, and that the pressure is not merely thirteen or fifteen tons to\r\nthe square inch, as it would be at depths between five and six miles,\r\nbut a hundred times that amount, as it might be between five and six\r\nhundred miles down. What would happen then? We can only imagine what\r\ndoes happen by stating what does not happen. It used to be supposed\r\nas late as half a century ago that the earth consisted of a crust of\r\nhard rocks perhaps thirty to fifty miles in thickness, and that below\r\nthis crust the whole earth was a mass of red-hot or white-hot molten\r\nstuff with flaming gases mixed with it. If that were the case it\r\nwould explain a good deal of what we see around us. It would explain\r\nthe volcanoes, for instance, which belch out fire and lava and ashes\r\nand molten rock, and sometimes great fragments of rock. Perhaps some\r\nof our readers may remember the great eruption of Mount Pelée, which\r\ntook place in Martinique some years ago. At one stage of the eruption\r\na great obelisk of rock a thousand feet high was pushed upwards out\r\nof the crater, and eventually sank back again. It came out of the\r\ndepths of the earth. It was like a vent-peg plugging some boiling\r\nmass below. Similarly we might suppose that all volcanoes were\r\nvent-holes for the tremendous commotion of boiling fiery rocks below\r\nthe earth's surface. The only thing we can urge is that they do not\r\nseem big enough for the purpose, if the earth were indeed all molten\r\nexcept for a thin crust--thirty miles thick. For that would leave a\r\nmolten ocean more than 7900 miles across any way it was measured:\r\n7900 miles deep, 7900 miles broad, 7900 miles long, if we take the\r\ndiameter of the earth to be 8000 miles. We all know what great tides\r\nthe Moon and Sun by their attraction raise in the earth's outer ocean\r\nof water. Think what tides they would raise in this inner ocean of\r\nmolten rock and metal. The earth's crust would not be able to hold\r\nsuch tides in. The molten stuff would be always breaking through the\r\nflimsy thirty miles of outer solid rock as if it were egg-shell.\r\nTwice a day there would be outbreaks of lava vast enough to submerge\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nNo, that will not do. We will not confuse our readers by telling them\r\nall the theories that have been formed, but will only state what\r\nthe late Lord Kelvin believed, and most of the present generation\r\nof geologists believe. It is that the heat of the earth's crust\r\ncontinues to increase only for a certain distance of the way down,\r\nand that owing to pressure the earth is solid (though very hot\r\nexcept towards the surface) for two thousand miles down. There\r\nremains a thickness of another four thousand miles on either side\r\nof the earth's centre to be considered. That might be molten, but\r\nthe pressure would be so great that it would behave as if it were a\r\nsolid. We know the earth cannot be solid all through because it does\r\nnot weigh enough. The earth cannot, of course, be weighed in any\r\nscales, but there are methods of weighing it nevertheless. One of\r\ntwo methods is by seeing how strongly it attracts bodies to itself.\r\nBut these things belong rather to the romance of astronomy than to\r\nthat of geology. We need only trouble ourselves at present about the\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nOne word more about the deep interior of the earth. Dr. J. J. See,\r\nan American astronomer, has found how heavy and how hard the earth\r\nis, taken as a whole. He finds that if it were built from surface\r\nto surface of hardened steel it would be just about as heavy and\r\nas hard--or as rigid. The steel would be like that used for the\r\narmour-plate of battleships. Dr. See is not prepared, however, to\r\ndiscard the idea that the earth has a large fluid interior. If it\r\nwere fluid, yet it would be subjected to such enormous pressure by\r\nits own weight, that if there were a moderately thick earth-crust,\r\nits tidal surgings would be so \"cabin'd, cribbed, confined,\" that\r\nthey would be comparatively ineffectual. We must not run away with\r\nthe idea (against which Dr. See specially warns us), that there is\r\nany free circulation of currents within the fluid interior. The\r\nrigidity produced by pressure (or weight) is too great for that.\r\nIndeed, this pressure is so great that, as another scientific\r\nauthority, Professor Arrhenius, has pointed out, the matter at\r\nthe core of the earth might even be gaseous; and yet would be so\r\ncompressed by pressure that it would possess a rigidity equal to the\r\nhardest steel. The earth may be partly solid, partly liquid, partly\r\ngaseous, but for all practical purposes Professor See would have us\r\nregard it as a solid sphere having an average hardness and weight\r\nand \"rigidity\" greater than that of ordinary steel.\r\n\r\nWe are still some way off an explanation of how the many igneous\r\nrocks which were and are being \"boiled up\" in some inner molten\r\ncauldron came to the surface; but the better to understand that we\r\nmust ask our readers to carry their imagination back to the very\r\nbeginning of the world when it was \"without form and void.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH AT ITS BEGINNING\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we look up at the sky with the eye of knowledge we can read in the\r\ncelestial objects with which it is strewn something of the history\r\nof our earth. We can only read it dimly even with the aid of the\r\ngreatest telescopes, and it is quite possible that in some respects\r\nwe may read it wrongly. Let us, however, consider what the eye and\r\nthe telescope will reveal to us. The eye will see the Sun--a great\r\nball, into which the earth might sink without greatly altering the\r\nSun's appearance, and surrounded with flaming gases hotter than the\r\nhottest furnace man has ever been able to contrive. In that heat\r\nevery solid thing on the earth would melt and be turned into vapour.\r\nThe eye will also perceive the Moon--another ball, much smaller than\r\nthe earth, surrounded by no gases at all, having as far as can be\r\nseen no water; and being so cold during its long nights that all\r\ngases and liquids of which we know would be frozen solid there.\r\n\r\nThe eye can also see a myriad of stars of varying brightness, but\r\nfor the most part only thus distinguishable. If the telescope be\r\nnow called in to aid, the eye will, however, be able to discern\r\ndifferences and distinctions in the stars. It will see that some\r\nare balls like the Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. If these balls are\r\nstudied attentively we shall discover that one of them, Jupiter, is\r\na great deal hotter than the earth, though a great deal cooler than\r\nthe Sun; and that another of them, Mars, is a great deal colder than\r\nthe earth, but a great deal warmer than the Moon. Perhaps we might\r\nnow begin to surmise that the Sun coming first, Jupiter next, the\r\nEarth next, Mars next, and the Moon last, were all like stages in the\r\nhistory of one of these balls; and that, for example, any one ball\r\nbegan by being as hot as the Sun, and ended, after passing through\r\nstages like Jupiter, the Earth, and Mars, in being as cold and\r\nlifeless as the Moon.\r\n\r\nBut if one had a very good telescope, and could examine those more\r\ndistant specks of light which we call stars, we perhaps could spy a\r\nlittle earlier into the history of these great balls. For example,\r\namong the blazing lights of the heavens--the stars which we know to\r\nbe suns--there are others which are not balls at all. There are the\r\nPleiades, for instance, of whom the Prophet Amos wrote, \"Seek Him\r\nthat maketh the seven stars and Orion\" (Amos v. 8). The seven stars\r\n(in the Authorised Version rendered Pleiades),[4] when seen through a\r\ngreat telescope, are caught in a mesh or a veil of something that may\r\nbe starry matter, but of the exact nature of which we are uncertain.\r\nIn other parts of the sky there are great masses of this starry\r\nmist; and to these bright patches astronomers have given the name\r\nof \"nebulæ.\" The most wonderful of them all is the great nebula in\r\nOrion;[5] and one of the most beautiful is the great spiral nebula of\r\nAndromeda. These objects are not only wonderful and beautiful; they\r\nalso give us a hint as to what might have been the earliest state\r\nof our earth, and of the Sun itself in those almost inconceivably\r\ndistant ages before order took the place of chaos.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: It has been cogently suggested that by the \"seven stars\"\r\nthe biblical writer meant the constellation of the Great Bear; but\r\nMr. E. W. Maunder, F.R.A.S., of Greenwich Observatory, is of opinion\r\nthat the Pleiades were signified.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"God maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the\r\nchambers of the south\" (Job IX. 9).]\r\n\r\nLet us ask the reader to imagine what would take place if the earth\r\nwere to come into collision with another planet. Some of our readers,\r\nat any rate, will know that the Sun and all its planets--the earth\r\namong them--is moving swiftly to some unknown destination among\r\nthe stars.[6] Suppose that some great planet, not of the Solar\r\nSystem, barred our path. We should not be taken wholly unawares, for\r\nastronomers would know of the approach of the star and our earth\r\nto one another months, and perhaps years, beforehand. That would\r\nbe because the light of the Sun falling on it would be reflected,\r\njust as the reflection of the Sun's rays light up the Moon for our\r\neyes. If the strange planet were a very large body, like the sun\r\nfor bigness, it would become visible far beyond the confines of\r\nthe Solar System. It might first be taken for a new star such as\r\nsometimes blazes up in the sky and then sinks into darkness again.\r\nBut its steadiness would make it an object of suspicion. There would\r\nbe another brief period in which it might be taken for a comet; but\r\ncomets have a light quite different from that of reflected sunlight.\r\nSo that anxious expectation would be dissipated, and the world would\r\nbegin to recognise the monster for what it really was. If its size\r\nwere the same as that of the Sun, then it would first become visible\r\nto us when 15,000,000,000 miles distant,[7] or let us say 1600 times\r\nfarther away from us than we are from the Sun. We and it would\r\napproach slowly at first. It would be nearly ten years before the\r\ndistance had been reduced to 6,000,000,000 of miles, and the intruder\r\nhad begun to be visible to the naked eye. In fourteen years it would\r\nhave reached the outer edge of the Solar System, and would be the\r\nbrightest star in the heavens. In another year it would be twice as\r\nbright as Venus at her brightest, and would be coming nearer with\r\nappalling swiftness. In less than two months it would be as near the\r\nSun as we are. In a week more it would have plunged into the Sun at\r\nthe rate of 400 miles a second, and in the awful heat born in that\r\ncollision, Sun and earth and planets would be molten, and the Solar\r\nSystem overwhelmed\r\n\r\n    In unremorseful folds of rolling fire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: It is usually supposed that this movement, amounting to\r\nperhaps ten miles a second, is in the direction of the constellation\r\nof Vega.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See an article by Mr. Ellard Gore in _Knowledge_,\r\nNovember, 1905. The object would not be visible at this distance\r\nexcept through large telescopes.]\r\n\r\nSuppose that this catastrophe were to take place. Would that be the\r\nend of all things? No. Out of the fiery mist many millions of miles\r\nacross--like one of those great nebulæ which the telescopes reveal\r\nto us--order would be evolved. Two things would at once begin to\r\nhappen, since in the Universe nothing stands still. The fiery mist\r\nwould be giving out heat all about it, sending out heat-waves as a\r\nfire or a red-hot poker will do. The red-hot poker cools; so, too,\r\nwould the fiery nebula. Then the nebula would begin to condense; not\r\nquite in the same way that a cloud of steam does, for it would be\r\nwhirling all the time, and its fiery particles would be all trying\r\nto fall inwards, just as anything dropped from our hands tends to\r\nfall towards the centre of the earth. As this whirling mass of gas\r\ncondensed some great masses of it would become detached, and would\r\nbegin to enjoy separate existences of their own.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine, for the sake of argument, that a mass of gas vast\r\nenough, when it condensed, to form the earth itself became detached\r\nfrom the parent nebula. Suppose we follow its history. At first it\r\nmay have been a globe hardly distinguishable from a whirling flame.\r\nIn brightness it was like the Sun, and like the Sun, it was covered\r\nwith elemental gases. It was, in fact, in its earliest days a sphere\r\nof gas continually giving out heat, and continually cooling, till\r\nfrom a sphere like the Sun it became a ball like Jupiter. It had\r\nan intermediate stage when its gases were condensing into liquids,\r\nas steam condenses into water; for though the nebula as a whole\r\nwas hot it was always travelling through cold space. Gradually the\r\nearth became partly liquid and partly gas. For millions of years it\r\ncontinued to revolve as a ball of liquid--still cooling--still being\r\npressed very hard at its central parts by the weight of all the gases\r\nand liquids round it, till at last the first crust of solid matter\r\nbegan to form on the liquid surface. This crust continued to thicken,\r\nbut it was subject to many appalling catastrophes and breakages.\r\n\r\nWe have already used the occurrence of the tides of the earth as an\r\ninstance of the Sun's attraction. The Sun (and the Moon) attract the\r\nwaters of the earth, pulling them up towards themselves. So would\r\nthey also attract the molten materials of which the early earth was\r\ncomposed. The liquid mass would be continually surging like a tide\r\nagainst its wall of solid crust, and the liquid would now and again\r\nburst through. There must have been a time when the thin solid crust\r\ncovering the molten interior became, owing to the solidification\r\nand contraction of the crust, much too small to contain the liquid\r\nmaterial. The lava would then break through, and would form huge\r\ncraters, not unlike some of those which we see on the Moon. We can\r\nfaintly imagine these terrible outbreaks in which the molten tide\r\nrose not thirty or forty feet but many miles high!\r\n\r\nLater, after some relief had been given by these outbreaks and the\r\ncrust thickened, the interior regions of the earth by cooling shrank\r\naway from the solid shell, which was now too large. This solid shell\r\nbeing insufficiently supported sometimes caved in, and other great\r\noutflows of lava resulted. These lava floods dissolved the original\r\nsolid shell whenever they came in contact with it. The earth probably\r\nonce had gigantic craters like those which we can see in their\r\nextinct form on the Moon; but they were destroyed by these outflows\r\nof lava of which we have spoken.\r\n\r\nThen, still cooling, the earth's crust grew thicker and thicker. The\r\ngreat outflows and eruptions of molten elements from underneath grew\r\nfewer, and more liquid elements cooled into solids, and more gases\r\ncondensed into liquids. There was another thing happening of which,\r\nas conscientious recorders of the history of the earth's geology, we\r\nmust take note; and it is that in those early days meteorites were\r\nfalling on the earth in vastly greater numbers than they do to-day.\r\nMeteorites are masses of cooled rock flying through space which still\r\noccasionally fall on the earth, and specimens of them are still to be\r\nfound, many of them preserved in museums, such as the Natural History\r\nMuseum in Cromwell Road, London. But the earth in its path has\r\nswept most of them up, as the housemaid's dusting-pan collects the\r\nfragments of dust. When the earth was young there were incomparably\r\nmore fragments to collect, and they fell on the earth like rain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the cooling water vapour became the oceans; clouds and\r\nrain and cool winds and eventually snow and ice became possible; and\r\nthe hardening lavas, or fire-born rocks, became subject to their\r\ninfluences, till above them were raised the stratified rocks, of\r\nwhich we have spoken in our earlier chapters, and the lineage and\r\ndescent of which is part of the study of geology. On the earth most\r\nof the traces of its earlier history have been removed, but there\r\nare some signs of them perceptible to the comprehending eye. The\r\nearth is probably seamed with great cracks that do not now reach to\r\nthe surface, but which are indicated by the presence of chains of\r\nvolcanoes. The volcanoes of the great chains of the Andes lie along a\r\nstraight crack reaching from Southern Peru to Terra del Fuego, 2500\r\nmiles in length. The volcanoes of the Aleutian Islands lie along a\r\ncurved track equally long. Other shorter lines of volcanoes are very\r\nnumerous, and since countless others existed in former times, the\r\ncracks in the earth's crust must be exceedingly numerous. There is\r\none crack which comes to the surface in various places in Eastern\r\nAsia and Western Africa, and stretching from the Dead Sea to Lake\r\nNyassa, reaches the enormous length of 3500 miles.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief sketch of the formation of the earth, its progress\r\nand processes, and from the hints which the volcanoes and earthquakes\r\nof to-day afford us, we may obtain some idea of the underworld that\r\nlies far beneath our feet. Not much, however, for we are ignorant of\r\nthe actual conditions which exist towards the centre of the earth.\r\nBut there seems a strong case for supposing that there is an outer\r\nsolid crust of earth and an inner molten core of very great heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDHOOD OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now sum up the various stages in the early growth of the\r\nearth, as most geologists believe them to have occurred.\r\n\r\nThe first stage was that when the earth, shining like a star, existed\r\nas a fluid globe surrounded by heavy vapours of great thickness,\r\nwhich contained the future waters of the globe.\r\n\r\nThen began the second era of the earth's existence, when it was a hot\r\nsolid globe--solid at any rate at the surface, and with a temperature\r\nof about 2500° F. The globe's atmosphere still contained all the\r\nwaters of the earth. It contained all the carbonic acid gas which now\r\nexists in the limestones and in coal and other minerals containing\r\ncarbon. It contained also all the oxygen since shut up in the rocks\r\nand in vegetation and in animal substances. Such an atmosphere was\r\nprobably at least two hundred times as great as the atmosphere which\r\nnow surrounds the earth.\r\n\r\nThen followed an epoch when great volcanic action set in. We have\r\npartially described it already. Just a thin solid crust was all that\r\ncovered the molten interior of the globe. It was too thin always\r\nto contain the boiling liquid, and Titanic explosions, followed by\r\nenormous overflows of lava, continually broke up the crust. The\r\npressure was relieved by these explosions, and gradually the earth\r\nwould settle down again to its process of consolidation. Another\r\nexplosion would follow; again a great flow of lava; and again the\r\neffects of the catastrophe would subside. After each explosion and\r\noutflow the earth's crust would grow a little thicker. All this time,\r\nand for long succeeding ages, the earth was attracting to itself,\r\nas a magnet attracts iron filings, all the small bodies which it\r\nencountered on its path round the Sun. These little rocks or masses\r\nof matter, some great and some small, would each add something to the\r\nsize of the earth, and, by the shock of collision with it, something\r\nto the earth's heat--just as a bullet flattening itself against a\r\ntarget melts in the heat of collision. Just also as the bits of\r\nmatter which we call \"shooting-stars\" are set on fire by friction as\r\nthey rush into the earth's atmosphere. These meteorites, as they are\r\ncalled when they are comparatively small bodies, or \"planetismals,\"\r\nas they are called when they are large, still exist. But the earth,\r\nin the millions on millions of years which it has been coursing round\r\nthe Sun, has swept up all the large ones that are likely to fall into\r\nit, and there remain only the small ones which occasionally cross its\r\npath. These are called \"Leonids\" or \"Lyrids\" or \"Perseids,\" and these\r\nmeteor showers occur at nearly the same time every year when the\r\nearth runs through a swarm of them on its pathway round the Sun. But\r\nthey are very small. Some of them are no bigger than a slate pencil.\r\nFew are as big as brickbats, and nearly all are burnt up by the\r\nair-friction before they reach the earth's surface. Larger ones still\r\nfall on the earth, however, and it is calculated that many hundreds\r\nreach us in fragments every year. But when the earth was young many\r\nthousands fell every day.\r\n\r\nTo this era, or immediately before it, belongs the birth of the Moon.\r\nIt is a subject of interest to geologists, because it is admitted\r\nthat the materials of which the Moon is constituted are similar\r\nto those of the earth; and it is believed that its history up to\r\na certain point was very like that of the earth. It had its great\r\nvolcanic era such as we have described; but its development closed\r\nshortly afterwards. We are considering, however, at this moment\r\nits origin. It was once part of the earth. All of us have read of\r\nthose little animals, of which one form is the amœba and another\r\nform the white corpuscles of the blood. If we watch them under the\r\nmicroscope we may see one of them slowly lengthen out, then break in\r\ntwo, and each part go swimming away by itself, a perfect animal. It\r\nwas Sir G. H. Darwin, F.R.S., who proved mathematically in 1879 that\r\nthe origin of the Moon was such that we may properly compare it to\r\nthe splitting up of the little animals just described. The date of\r\nthis event cannot be fixed even approximately--beyond saying that\r\nas astronomical events go it must have been rather recent, though\r\nnot less than fifty million years ago. The Moon is therefore one of\r\nthe younger members of the Solar System. But no other catastrophe,\r\neither before or since, has occurred on the earth to compare with\r\nits prodigious birth. Five thousand million cubic miles of material\r\nleft the earth's surface never again to return to it. Whether it all\r\nleft at once or whether the action was prolonged we do not know, but\r\nwe may try in vain to imagine the awful uproar and fearful volcanic\r\nphenomena exhibited when a planet was cleft in twain and a new moon\r\nwas born into the Solar System.\r\n\r\nThen, life still being absent from the earth, the _Oceanic Era_\r\nbegan. The waters condensed into an ocean over the earth, or else\r\ncollected in some great oceanic depression. Lands presently emerged\r\nfrom it. It was a hot ocean, steaming no doubt, for its temperature\r\nwas perhaps about 500° F. Some one may ask--Why, then, did it not\r\nsteam away into clouds? The answer is that the atmosphere was still\r\nvery heavy in that past era, probably still exerting a pressure\r\nas much as fifty times as great as to-day. The pressure of the\r\natmosphere at the earth's surface to-day is usually about fifteen\r\npounds to the square inch. In such circumstances water boils rapidly\r\naway at the temperature of 212° F. But if the water be taken up to\r\nthe top of Mont Blanc, where the air pressure is less than that at\r\nthe sea-level (or if, which amounts to the same thing, we reduce the\r\npressure on the water's surface by placing it under the receiver\r\nof an air-pump and partially exhaust the air), it will boil at a\r\nlower temperature than this. If, on the other hand, we increase\r\nthe pressure on the surface of the water by any means, such, for\r\nexample, as by placing it in a chamber of compressed air, the water\r\ncan be heated to a higher temperature without boiling away. In the\r\nbygone era of which we are speaking the pressure of the atmosphere\r\non the water's surface was 700 lb. or 800 lb. to the square inch;\r\nand therefore it could be heated up to a high temperature without\r\nevaporating rapidly.\r\n\r\nAnother thing began to happen in those days. All bodies in space\r\nattract one another; the Sun attracts its planets; the planets\r\nattract the Sun and their satellites; and the satellites in their\r\nturn attract the planets. Ages before the earth had a moon these\r\nforces were at work. But the attractions of solid bodies for one\r\nanother do not bring about any very perceptible alterations in their\r\nshapes; though if the bodies are spinning they effect slow changes in\r\ntheir speed of rotation. It is different when the bodies are liquid,\r\nor if they have liquid surfaces. Then the attractions of a sun or\r\na moon on a planet begin to draw up the waters of the planet and\r\nproduce tides. The attraction of the earth would produce tides on\r\nthe Moon if an ocean existed there; and, it is suspected, do produce\r\nsomething resembling tides on the present surface of the Sun.[8] As\r\nsoon, therefore, as oceans appeared on the earth the waters began\r\nto ebb and flow in tides. (Another consequence of this constant ebb\r\nand flow was that the friction of these movements began to diminish\r\nthe speed of the earth's rotation--just as a string that was placed\r\nround the circumference of a spinning-top would, if constantly\r\npulled backwards and forwards, gradually help to slow down the top.)\r\nThen oceanic waves and currents would begin to eat a way into the\r\nland that was on their borders, or which was emerging from their\r\ndepths. Rivers would begin to arise, and they would carry on the\r\nwork of erosion. Other causes tending to break up the rocks would\r\nbe the gases in the air--the excessive quantities of carbonic acid\r\nand oxygen would be active chemical agents in this work. Before the\r\nclose of this era the limestones and iron carbonates began to form;\r\nsediments arose in the lifeless oceans, and thus began the first\r\nformation of those sedimentary rocks and strata which have been dealt\r\nwith in the earlier chapters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: A paper read by Mr. E. W. Maunder before the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society in 1907 gave reasons for believing that the\r\nearth has perceptible effects on the movements of sun-spots.]\r\n\r\nAfter the lifeless era began the age when the lowest forms of life\r\ncame into existence. The initial stage was perhaps the _Era of the\r\nFirst Plants_, Algæ, and later still aquatic fungi or bacteria.\r\nThis began when the general temperature of the ocean may have been\r\nas high as 150° F. (some water plants can now live in waters up to\r\nand above 180° F.). Limestones began to form from the secretions of\r\nplants, and deposits of silica from silica secretions. Also where\r\nthe conditions were favourable there were large sedimentary deposits\r\nand accumulations. In the second part of this æon the earth, still\r\ncontinuing to cool, and going down in temperature to 115°, gave\r\nopportunity to animal life. At the end of this era the general\r\ntemperature of the earth and its oceans was as low as 90° F. The\r\nfirst animal life had begun to appear; its activity greatly increased\r\nunder what were favourable conditions for it. This increase of animal\r\nlife had its effect on the earth's crust. We have already spoken of\r\nthe formation of limestones from the bodies of sea animals. This was\r\ngoing on in those ages millions of years ago before any of the higher\r\nforms of life had appeared on the earth, and though it was not going\r\non so rapidly, still it must be remembered that at some point of\r\nthe world's history the oceans were of greater extent than now, and\r\nconsequently the deposits of lime and the accumulations of sediment\r\nwere more widespread. The sedimentary rocks grew faster and faster,\r\nespecially on the floors of the oceans.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood by those who have read the foregoing two\r\nchapters closely that the \"igneous\" or fire-born rocks must lie\r\nunderneath the sedimentary ones. But that is only true in general\r\nterms, for a double reason. In the first place, owing to the\r\ninestimable forces which for millions of years were still continually\r\neffective below the earth's crust, the igneous rocks over and over\r\nagain were able to burst their way through the slow-forming sediment\r\nof other rocks laid down above them. In the second place, the igneous\r\nrocks, owing to their composition and superior hardness, were much\r\nless worn by wind and weather than the less compact \"sedimentary\r\nrocks,\" and these remained, showing themselves at the surface as\r\ncoast-lines of oceans and in mountain ranges, after the sandstones\r\nand shales and limestones had disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nThe Crater of an Extinct Volcano\r\n\r\nThis is the entrance to the long extinct volcano of Red Mountain,\r\nArizona.]\r\n\r\nThe memorials of volcanic action remain, we had almost said\r\npermanently, among the decay of other rocks, though, of course, even\r\nhard volcanic or igneous rocks will be worn down in time. In many\r\ncases volcanoes themselves are left, though they may have been for\r\nages extinct. In some volcanic regions where no great central cones\r\nhave existed the vast floods of lava that were poured forth extend\r\nto-day as vast black plains of naked rock, mottled with shifting\r\nsand-hills, or as undulating tablelands carved by running water\r\ninto valleys and ravines, between which the successive sheets of\r\nlava are exposed in terraced hills. Beyond the limits over which\r\nthe lava sheets have spread there are often great veins or parapets\r\nor sunken walls of lava to which are given the names of igneous or\r\nvolcanic \"dykes.\" Dykes vary from less than a foot to one hundred\r\nfeet in breadth, and often run in nearly straight courses sometimes\r\nfor many miles. They consist usually of very hard rock like basalt,\r\n\"andesite,\" or \"diabase.\"\r\n\r\nThey were fissures in the earth's surface, and, after the manner we\r\nhave described, the molten rock welled forth through these fissures,\r\nand spread out sheet after sheet, till like a rising lake it has not\r\nonly overflowed the lower grounds but even buried all the minor hills.\r\n\r\nLava eruptions of this kind have taken place in recent years in\r\nIceland. On a small scale they can be seen to take place in the\r\nisland of Hawaii, where the outflows of lava reproduce for us,\r\nlike models in miniature, the great outbreaks of the past. On the\r\nlargest possible scale similar effects may be seen on the great lava\r\nplains of the Moon, where the giant craters that we can see through\r\ntelescopes are not the mouths of extinct volcanoes, but the banked-up\r\nedges and shores of lava outflows.\r\n\r\nOn a much smaller scale than this, but still on a gigantic scale,\r\nthe same thing took place in Western North America, where there are\r\nvast tracts of land which are best to be explained by supposing that\r\nthere were once great outbreaks and overflows. The area which has\r\nthere been flooded with lava has been estimated to be larger than\r\nthat of France and Great Britain put together, and the depth of the\r\ntotal mass erupted reaches in some places as much as 3700 feet.\r\nSome rivers have cut gorges in this plain of lava, laying bare its\r\ncomponent rocks to a depth of 700 feet or more. Along the walls of\r\nthese ravines we see that the lava is arranged in parallel beds or\r\nsheets often not more than ten or twenty feet thick, each of which,\r\nof course, represents a separate outpouring of molten rock.\r\n\r\nThese are comparatively modern lava plains, although, of course, the\r\noutpourings in North America occurred ages before historic time,\r\nor, indeed, before there are any traces of man's existence on the\r\nearth. Such lava outflows can only occasionally be examined--as\r\nin the instance just quoted when rivers have cut deep into them.\r\nConsequently we have to speculate on the connection between the\r\ndykes and fissures and the lava flood itself. But in various parts\r\nof the world lava plains of much older date have been so eaten into\r\nand worn by the action of the elements that not only the successive\r\nsheets of lava are exposed but the rock floor over which they poured.\r\nExposed also are the abundant dykes which served as the channels\r\nby which the lava rose to the surface. In Western Europe important\r\nexamples of this structure occur from the north of Iceland through\r\nthe inner Hebrides and the Faroe Islands to Iceland. This volcanic\r\nbelt presents a succession of lava sheets, which even yet, in spite\r\nof enormous waste, are in some places more than 3000 feet thick.\r\nThese sheets are nearly flat and rise in terraces over one another\r\ninto green grassy hills or into the dark fronts of lofty sea-washed\r\nprecipices. Where sheets have been stripped off or worn down by wind\r\nand weather thousands of volcanic dykes are exposed. These dykes are,\r\nas it were, the roots of which the lava sheets were the branches; and\r\neven where the whole of the material that gushed up to the surface\r\nhas been worn away the dykes remain as evidence of the vigour and\r\nenergy of the volcanic forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH AS THE ABODE OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we spoke of the formation of the atmosphere of\r\nthe earth and of the growth of the oceans. We must now consider the\r\nformation of these more closely, and we must distinguish between the\r\ngreat vaporous clouds which rolled about the earth in its molten\r\nstate and the settled atmosphere which formed about it when it grew\r\ncooler.\r\n\r\nAfter the earth had begun to solidify it was at first covered with\r\na collection of porous fragments of rock covering the earth like a\r\nshell and containing the elements of water. Such materials in general\r\nappearance would be not unlike the pumice stone which is expelled\r\nfrom volcanoes to-day. Those who have never had the fortune to see\r\nvolcanic eruptions for themselves usually imagine that the volcano\r\nthrows out nothing but fire and smoke. As a matter of fact it throws\r\nout vast quantities of vapour, of which, according to Sir Archibald\r\nGeikie, 999 parts in 1000 are steam. At the great eruption of Mount\r\nPelée the cloud of steam continually arising from the volcano for\r\nmonths in succession was several cubic miles in measurement.\r\nConsequently it will be seen that the porous volcanic rocks with\r\nwhich the young earth was covered contained all the materials for\r\nwater-manufacture within themselves. As the water began to form,\r\nsqueezed out of the porous rocks as we can squeeze it out of a sponge\r\n(or as we might steam it out if we put the moist sponge in an oven),\r\nit gathered itself into reservoirs underground. As it increased in\r\nbulk it rose nearer to the surface; because, of course, owing to\r\nthe heat of the inner portions of the earth it could never succeed\r\nin sinking below a certain depth. Doubtless it first appeared at\r\nthe bottom of the pits which had been sunk by volcanoes or volcanic\r\naction. There must have been innumerable depressions in the earth's\r\nsurface as widespread and deeper than those which we can perceive\r\non the rugged surface of the Moon. We may gain an idea on a very\r\nminute scale of what the first pits of water were like from the\r\nexamples (formed, however, at a much later period and probably in a\r\ndifferent way) of the crater lakes that are left to-day. Some curious\r\nexamples of \"crater lakes\" are to be found in the Eifel district\r\nof Germany, an ancient volcanic region which lies in the triangle\r\nformed by the junction of the Rhine and the Moselle at Coblenz. One\r\nof the pleasing peculiarities of this district is that, owing to\r\nthe volcanic nature of the soil, the neighbourhood is seldom dusty,\r\neven in August or September, after the dry continental summer. It is\r\nwell worth visiting for its castles as well as for its crater lakes\r\nand other volcanic relics, and it is the scene of R. L. Stevenson's\r\nromance _Prince Otto_. The chief crater lakes are between Daun and\r\nManderscheid. There are, of course, many other and larger crater\r\nlakes in existence, but we select these because they are so easily\r\naccessible.\r\n\r\nThe flow of the lakes into one another followed. Innumerable lakelets\r\ndeveloped into rivers or chains of lakes on the surface of the young\r\nplanet, continually becoming larger bodies of water, till they\r\ndeveloped into the vast irregular oceans of to-day. This evolution is\r\nof great importance from a geological point of view, because it leads\r\nthe way to the origin of the ocean basins and the great platforms of\r\nland which we call continents. It is easy to see that because of the\r\nweight of water in the depressions the earth under the waters tended\r\nto become more and more depressed, so that the water areas tended\r\nto grow larger and deeper. The wash of earths from the land tended\r\nto build its borders out into the water basins, but the deepening\r\nand spreading of the water basins is believed to have been the most\r\nmarked feature of the earth's early growth. All this time the earth\r\nwas growing in diameter and circumference.[9] When this growth ceased\r\nother causes and effects came into play, and the proportions of sea\r\nand land became better balanced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: For reasons which are a little too complex to be\r\nconsidered here. We can only indicate the general line of reasoning\r\nby saying that the central heat as it moved outwards from the rocks\r\nnearer the surface expanded them.]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in our human knowledge to tell us with certainty\r\nwhen or how life first appeared on the earth. We have already spoken\r\nof animal and vegetable remains that for ages are preserved in the\r\nrocks. But clearly no such remains could ever be found in the\r\nvolcanic or molten rocks of the earliest stages of the earth's life.\r\nThink for a moment of what the simplest forms of life are. A great\r\ndeal has been heard of microbes and bacteria during recent years,\r\nand we may therefore assume that every one has some knowledge of the\r\nstructure of these simplest living things. They may be compared to\r\ntiny bladders of jelly--so small that the microscope is necessary\r\nin order to see them, and sometimes so much smaller than this that\r\nthe best microscopes cannot distinguish them. Such forms of life are\r\ncalled \"unicellular organisms,\" because they consist of a single\r\ncell, which contains the jelly-like substance called protoplasm, and\r\na smaller body, smaller even than these tiny cells themselves, which\r\nis called the nucleus.\r\n\r\nThese are the simplest forms of life. But all the higher forms of\r\nlife, and we may say, roughly speaking, any form of life that the\r\nunaided eye can see, is made up not of one cell but of many cells.\r\nA human being, for example, is made up of uncounted millions of\r\ncells; and millions of cells go to the formation of a worm, a fish,\r\na gnat, or indeed to the formation of the simplest well-known animal\r\nthat the ordinary person could name. Similarly millions of cells go\r\nto the formation of a leaf or a twig. These higher forms of life\r\nare called \"multicellular organisms,\" because they have many cells,\r\nand most often many different kinds of cells. For instance, in the\r\nbody of a man there are different kinds of cells to form the skin,\r\nor the lining of the mouth, or the substance of the eyes, or the\r\nred or white corpuscles of the blood, or the grey matter of the\r\nbrain, or the roots of the hair--to name only a few. Thus we see how\r\ncomplicated the structure of animals has become since life first\r\nmade its appearance on the earth. The cells joined themselves to\r\nform tissues; and the tissues joined themselves to form organs; and\r\nthese things had to happen before anything like a complete animal of\r\nthe higher type, or even a complete vegetable, made its appearance.\r\nSuppose by some great cataclysm, not so great as that which we have\r\nimagined in an earlier chapter, but still world-wide in its effects,\r\nthe whole world should once again be swept by a great outbreak of\r\nlava and molten rocks, which of all the living things would leave\r\ntraces of its existence? Perhaps a few of the animals with great\r\nbones, or the great trees, might leave an impress of themselves\r\nin the depths of the overwhelming rocks, just as we can stamp the\r\nimpress of the skin of our finger-tips on hot sealing-wax; but it is\r\nfairly evident that all the soft-tissued animals and vegetables would\r\ndisappear entirely and leave not a trace behind--certainly no trace\r\nthat anybody could recognise many millions of years afterwards. It is\r\nstill more certain that the simplest forms of life, \"the unicellular\r\norganisms,\" would leave no trace at all. We know that side by side\r\nwith the complicated organisms that we can see the simplest organisms\r\nexist now; and must have existed at the beginning of life. Yet when\r\nwe examine the records of living things in the rocks which were\r\nformed in the youth of the world, and go back right to the earliest\r\nof these forms of life that have ever been discovered, we find that\r\nsuch specimens are all of the rather higher (if not of the highest\r\nforms of life). From that we infer that life must have existed many\r\nages before the period of such remains, though, as we should have\r\nexpected, all examples of the earlier forms have disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhere did this life come from? Lord Kelvin once rashly committed\r\nhimself to the notion that life might have been brought to the earth\r\non one of those flying pieces of rock, which we have already spoken\r\nof, which are named meteorites, or on a fragment of some other\r\nplanetary body that had been cast out into space. The speculation is\r\nnot so wildly improbable as it has sometimes been considered to be,\r\nbecause recent researches have shown that it is not impossible for\r\nlife to survive at the very low temperatures which a meteorite would\r\nexperience on its way through space, and also that the time which a\r\nsmall body would occupy in travelling, let us say from Mars to the\r\nearth, would not be too great for the prolonged existence of some\r\ngerm of life on the meteorite. On the other hand, there is nothing\r\nin known meteorites to suggest that they came from worlds where\r\nconditions exist suitable for life as we know it; and, moreover, even\r\nif we shut our eyes to these improbabilities, we are no nearer to\r\na solution of the problem of where and how life began. To say that\r\nit was brought to earth on a meteorite is merely to throw back the\r\nproblem another stage, for we have still to ask how life began on the\r\nmeteorite and on the planet from which it came. The indirect evidence\r\nregarding the probable beginning of the era of life on the earth is\r\nalso extremely difficult to examine, and we can only say that the\r\nbest geological authority leans to the idea that the conditions\r\nwhen life would have been possible on the earth were finished long\r\nbefore the earth had finished growing, and that these conditions may\r\nhave existed when the earth was about the size of Mars. Consequently\r\nthe first beginnings of life may have existed at depths hundreds\r\nof miles below the earth's surface of to-day. The life was then,\r\nhowever, only of the very simplest kind; it was probably vegetable\r\nlife. Probably also the first life appeared in the ocean, though it\r\nis not altogether unlikely that it may have begun, and have gone on\r\ndeveloping, in fresh water--in those great pits which were first\r\nformed by volcanoes and which afterwards became lakes and then seas.\r\n\r\nFor our purpose, however, it will be sufficient to say that life\r\nbegan in the great bodies of water which were accumulating on the\r\nglobe, and which owing to the washing down by rain and rivers and\r\nstream and wave action of land materials were becoming \"saltier,\" or\r\nmore highly charged with mineral salts of various kinds. The early\r\nforms of life were of the nature of jelly-fish, or simple organisms\r\nwhich were permeated by the fluid in which they dwelt. The sea was\r\nthen warmer than it is now, and there are reasons for believing that\r\nit was something above 100° F., perhaps higher--perhaps rather hotter\r\nthan we should now care to bathe in. It was also at the beginning\r\nan ocean which was much less salt and had much less lime in it than\r\nnow. Its water was a good deal \"softer.\" It was, however, becoming\r\nmuch more hard, more like the Dead Sea, which, as everybody knows,\r\nis a body of water so charged with mineral salts and accumulations\r\nthat a bather cannot sink in it, and will emerge from his bath\r\nencrusted with salty deposits. As the early ocean became more and\r\nmore saturated (with lime and carbonates, etc.), the more vigorous of\r\nthe living forms in the water began to resist the change in various\r\nways. They tried to meet it, or to alter themselves so as not to be\r\nincommoded by it.\r\n\r\nThis is a very familiar occurrence in natural life and evolution.\r\nPerhaps the commonest example of it that we can select is the\r\nformation of corns on the human feet and hands. A corn, properly\r\nconsidered, is the defence raised by the skin against unusual or\r\ndiscommoding pressure or friction. When a boot is too tight, or\r\nwhen a plough handle or a cricket bat or a golf club is continually\r\nclasped tightly, a \"callosity\" or horn-like defence is formed. In\r\nsome cases a blister is antecedent to the corn; and we may regard\r\nthis not only as showing the need for the hardening of the skin, but\r\nas being a stage preliminary to it. There are many other instances.\r\nHair is formed as a protection to the body, and owing to nature's\r\neconomies is not usually formed when clothing takes its place or\r\nheat renders it unnecessary. If the heat is too great, or the light\r\nbeating on the unprotected skin is too strong, then another form\r\nof protection takes the place of hair. Why is it that races living\r\nnear the Equator wear \"the burnished livery of the burning sun,\"\r\nand show black or brown pigmentation of the skin? It is because\r\nthis pigmentation arrests the penetration of the rays of the sun\r\nmore effectively than a garment. Lately Dr. Sambon has pointed\r\nout that the white linen clothes which Europeans generally wear\r\nin the tropics, though they look cool, are not sufficient screens\r\nagainst the rays of light and heat, and has suggested that white\r\nmen's clothes, to be properly protective against the sun, ought to\r\nbe woven of threads of two colours, so that the garments should be\r\nwhite outside and black inside. Apply these principles to animals in\r\nsea-water, who were distressingly affected by conditions to which\r\nthey had never been subjected. What would happen? The weaker would\r\nprobably be killed by the change in the conditions, just as some\r\nfresh-water fishes and animalculæ would be killed now if plunged into\r\nsea-water. The stronger would, however, become acclimatised, and\r\nwould in the course of successive generations struggle to adapt their\r\nbodies to the new conditions.\r\n\r\nThus the living organisms in the earth's early sea contrived to cut\r\nthemselves off from being bathed with the novel carbonaceous water.\r\nThey cut themselves off from it in the course of generations by\r\nclosing themselves off from it with skin or membrane. Many of them\r\nstirred up their cells to secrete lime and exude it so as to form for\r\nthemselves a more or less impervious covering or shell. Finally, as\r\nthey grew to like the mineral water less, they continually made fresh\r\nexperiments to avoid it, and the more enterprising and adventurous\r\ngot out of the ocean altogether, and migrated to the air or the land,\r\nperhaps by way of the shore sands and muds. This period, when the\r\nocean seems to have passed its best stage for supporting all forms of\r\nlife, appears to have been that which is geologically known as the\r\nCambrian. After this period there was a wealth of ferns, of animals\r\nable to leave hard traces of themselves in the fossil records. Before\r\nthis period there was no physiological need for either skin or shell.\r\nBut once the skin and shell had been developed, primarily as a\r\ndefence against the sea-water, their great advantages for purposes of\r\nthe struggle for life among all forms of animals soon made themselves\r\nfelt, and so they were retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLIFE IN OTHER WORLDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf life was not brought to the earth from another planet, then life\r\nwas created, or originated, on the earth. Some of the conditions\r\nwhich attended its birth have been considered, and they amount to\r\nthis: that the temperature of the earth, the elements of the earth,\r\nthe conditions of the earth's surface, oceans, and atmosphere were\r\nexactly those which favoured the origination, the continuance, and\r\nthe development of living things. The earth, among all the heavenly\r\nbodies which we can examine at all closely, is probably the only one\r\non which life, as we know it, would have much chance of survival.\r\n\r\nThe Sun as an abode of life we may at once put out of the question.\r\nTaking the planets in order of distance from the Sun: of Mercury we\r\nknow very little, but astronomers like Schiaparelli and Lowell have\r\npronounced it to be an airless, dead planet with a surface cracked in\r\ncooling untold ages ago. Venus is believed to be much like the earth,\r\nnot differing greatly in size, and probably having an atmosphere of\r\nconsiderable extent;[10] but its appearance is so bright, viewed\r\nfrom the earth, that it has been surmised that what we see is not\r\nthe planet itself but its atmosphere always charged with clouds or\r\npossibly snow. Of Mars as an abode of life, and of the Moon, which\r\nis the body nearest to us, we shall speak more fully in the present\r\nchapter. Coming to the outer major planets, the giant Jupiter--with\r\na bulk more than a thousand times as great as the earth--has a\r\nconstitution by no means so solid. For many reasons the belief seems\r\njustified that Jupiter must be a still hot, and almost gaseous body,\r\nwithout a solid crust. If Jupiter's comparatively small weight for\r\nits size and its wonderful and varying system of cloud coverings\r\nare evidence of an early stage of development and a high internal\r\ntemperature, still more is this the case with Saturn. In bulk it is\r\nnot far inferior to Jupiter; but it is so much lighter than water\r\nthat if some of its fragments fell into one of the earth's oceans\r\nthey would float there. Its outer coverings or envelopes must consist\r\nof heated gases in active circulation. Of Uranus and Neptune, still\r\nfarther off, we know very little, and the progress of knowledge\r\nconcerning them is very slow; but it is more probable that they are\r\nin the early stage of development attributed to Jupiter and Saturn\r\nthan in the solid stage of planets like the earth. So that we may\r\nfairly dismiss the probability of the existence of life as we know it\r\non any of them--and neglect incidentally, therefore, any possibility\r\nthat life could have been carried in a meteorite from them to us.\r\nWhether there are other forms of \"life\" than any we know is a\r\nquestion hardly needing discussion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: W. W. Bryant, _A History of Astronomy_ (Methuen),\r\n1907.]\r\n\r\nThere remains the question of the probability of life on the Moon or\r\non Mars; and the question of possible life on the Moon is specially\r\nworth consideration, because the earth's satellite was once part of\r\nthe earth's mass. We may first repeat briefly the explanation which\r\nSir G. H. Darwin has given of the Moon's separation from the earth.\r\nIf a flexible hoop or ring is spun very rapidly it will be seen to\r\nflatten itself at top and bottom (or, as we might say, at its poles)\r\nand broaden itself out at its middle or equator. The semi-liquid\r\nearth once rotated so rapidly that its swelling equatorial belt was\r\nalmost at the point of separation from the parent body. Before this\r\noccurred, however, the tension was so great that one large portion\r\nof the protuberance, where it was weakest, broke away, and began\r\nto move around the earth at a considerable distance from it. There\r\nare several estimates of the bulk of the earth thus shot off; but\r\nwe may assume that about one-fiftieth of the earth escaped thus. It\r\nmust have consisted of a considerable portion of the earth's solid\r\ncrust, and a much larger quantity of the molten rocks of the earth's\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nThe Moon is much lighter than the earth. The earth taken as a whole\r\nweighs about five and a half times as much as water. If we consider\r\nits surface alone, this weighs rather more than two and a half times\r\nthe weight of water--from which it can be seen that the interior of\r\nthe earth is very much denser than the earth's surface crust.[11]\r\nThe Moon weighs rather less than three and a half times its bulk\r\nin water. This shows clearly that the Moon is composed of material\r\nscraped off from the outer surface of the earth, rather than of\r\nmatter obtained from a considerable depth. At the same time the layer\r\nof material removed had an appreciable thickness. The volume of the\r\nMoon is equivalent to a solid body whose surface is equal to the\r\narea of all the earth's oceans, and whose depth would be thirty-six\r\nmiles. It seems probable, therefore, that at the time when the Moon\r\nwas torn off, or shot off, from the earth, the parent body had a\r\nsolid crust averaging at least thirty-six miles in thickness, while\r\nbeneath this crust the temperature was so high that the materials\r\nunderneath were molten or liquid, and in other places were only kept\r\nsolid by the enormous pressure of the material above them. When\r\nthe Moon separated from the earth three-quarters of this crust was\r\ncarried away. It has sometimes been supposed that the remainder was\r\ntorn into two parts, one of which formed the great land area of the\r\nEastern Hemisphere and the other the great land area of which North\r\nand South America are the relics in the Western Hemisphere. These two\r\ngreat areas, at that time, floated on the semi-liquid surface like\r\ntwo large ice-floes. But they were, of course, a good deal heavier\r\nthan ice, and the molten stuff on which they floated was a good deal\r\nheavier than water. Later on this liquid stuff cooled and hardened.\r\nBut its bottom was still a good deal lower than the surface of the\r\ngreat areas of land which had \"floated\" on it; and therefore it\r\nformed great depressions all about and surrounding them. Thus the\r\ndepressions were there ready formed, into which the waters of the\r\nearth, beginning as rain and ending as rivers or lakes, could flow as\r\ninto reservoirs. On the whole scientific men incline to believe that,\r\naccording to a popular tradition, the Moon may have been torn from\r\nthe earth where the Pacific Ocean now lies, and may have left that\r\nhollow behind it when it went.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The figures are: earth's specific gravity = 5·6. The\r\nspecific gravity of the surface material ranges from, in general,\r\nbetween 2·2 and 3·2, with an average of 2·7. The specific gravity of\r\nthe Moon is 3·4.]\r\n\r\nMany people, scientific men and astronomers among them, have imagined\r\nthe possibilities of life on the Moon. In his clever romance, _The\r\nFirst Man on the Moon_, Mr. H. G. Wells has gathered together all\r\nthe more reasoned speculations on the subject. They all turn on one\r\npoint--Is there an atmosphere on the Moon which would support life?\r\nThere are gases of some kind on the Moon. There must be gases, for\r\nexample, shut up in the moon's rocks; there may be gases in the\r\nMoon's interior. Mr. Wells imagined that there was a good deal of gas\r\ninside the Moon; indeed, he went so far as to suppose that the Moon\r\nwas partly hollow. If it were we should perhaps be able to accept\r\nthat as an explanation of the fact that the Moon is, bulk for bulk,\r\nconsiderably lighter than the earth, and is, in short, rather lighter\r\nthan we should expect it to be. If the Moon were hollow there might\r\nbe an atmosphere and water inside it, and a race of beings might\r\nlive there--in the underworld of the Moon. The \"Selenites,\" as Mr.\r\nWells called them, would probably be not in the least like human\r\nbeings, though they might be immeasurably more intelligent, because,\r\nseeing that the earth cooled at a later period than the moon, life\r\nmight have begun earlier on the Moon, and would have had, perhaps,\r\nmany hundreds of thousands of years in which to develop. Mr. Wells\r\ntherefore imagined the \"Selenites\" to resemble in some respects a\r\nrace of very large insects with enormous brains. However, we need\r\npursue these romantic speculations no further, but must turn to\r\ninquire not whether life might exist in the interior of the Moon\r\n(which we can never see), but what would be the kind of life that\r\ncould exist on the part of the Moon that we can see.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we believe that the atmosphere there would be\r\nvery, very thin; as thin as the atmosphere which is left in the\r\nbell-receiver of an ordinary air-pump when the experimenter has done\r\nthe best he can to exhaust it of air altogether.[12] In the second\r\nplace, the atmosphere would not be one of oxygen and nitrogen as\r\nthat of the earth is, but of some heavy gas like carbon-dioxide\r\n(which will not support animal life). The question is whether it\r\nwould support vegetable life. Several astronomers (no less eminent\r\na one than W. H. Pickering, of Harvard University, among them)\r\nhave supposed that it might, and they have imagined great jungles\r\nof vegetation springing up on the surface of the Moon under the\r\ninfluence of the Sun's rays--jungles which are stricken down again\r\nwhen they are four days old under the oncoming of night. For the\r\nMoon's day is equal to several of ours, and when night comes there\r\nthe temperature sinks to a level colder far than that of the earth's\r\nArctic regions; so cold, in fact, that even gases would be turned\r\nto liquid and then frozen solid. It is by no means certain that the\r\ngases we have mentioned would support vegetable life, but assuming\r\nthat they would, we should then expect the vegetation to spring up\r\nwith extraordinary rapidity--because it would be so little hampered\r\nby its own weight--when the vertical rays of the Sun were beating\r\ndown on the Moon. When that was the case the temperature there would\r\nbe from 500° (F.) to 600° (F.) higher than during the night.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: The exhaustion produced by an ordinary air-pump is\r\nnever a complete vacuum. Exhaustion which leaves only 1/2000th of the\r\noriginal air is unusually efficient.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may here explain some of the reasons why vegetation would\r\nbe little hampered by its own weight on the Moon. It is similar to\r\nthe reasons why light gases escape from the Moon. The mass of the\r\nMoon--that is to say, the amount of matter it contains--is 1/80th\r\nthat of the earth. Therefore since the weight of a body means the\r\nmeasure of the force by which gravity attracts it (to the earth or\r\nto the Moon), bodies on the Moon's surface are much lighter than\r\nthey are here. The ratio is almost exactly one-sixth; consequently a\r\nman weighing 180 lbs. on the earth if transplanted to the Moon would\r\nfind that he only weighed 30 lbs. there, and could carry two men at\r\nonce on his back for twenty miles much more easily than he could walk\r\nthat distance without a load here. He could throw a stone six times\r\nas far as on the earth, and jump six times as high. Indeed, jumping\r\nover a moderate-sized house would be a gymnastic feat scarcely worth\r\nmentioning on the Moon.\r\n\r\nAfter consideration of all these facts; and despite the belief of\r\nsome distinguished astronomers that changes are sometimes perceptible\r\non the Moon's surface; and that hoar frost can be perceived there;\r\nand perhaps volcanic eruptions--the general conclusion arrived\r\nat by astronomical authority is that organic life does not exist\r\neither on the Moon or in it; and we may conclude this outline of\r\nthe speculations concerning it by quoting the American astronomer,\r\nProfessor N. S. Shaler: \"It is naturally painful to conclude that the\r\nMoon is and always has been deprived of those features of existence\r\nwhich we deem the nobler; that it has never known the stir of air\r\nor water or the higher life of beings who inherit the profit of\r\nexperience, and thereby climb the way that has led upward to man.\r\nThat these large gifts have been denied to the nearest companion of\r\nthe earth has its lesson for the naturalist. How vast are the effects\r\narising from the interrelation of actions.... If the gases could\r\nhave been retained in the Moon (by its attractive force) there is no\r\nreason why it should not have had the history of a miniature earth.\r\nAs it is, from the beginning it appears to have been determined\r\nthat the Sun should not warm it in the same way as the earth; that\r\nrain should not fall on it, nor the stirrings of life and energy be\r\nvisible on it. There is no imaginable accident that can alter its\r\nstate. Just as it is, our Moon is likely to see the Sun go out.\"\r\n\r\nThis chapter may be ended by a brief application of some of these\r\nconsiderations to the case of the planet Mars. Next to the Moon Mars\r\nis our nearest neighbour, and the erection of great telescopes in\r\nAmerica, one of them at Flagstaff Observatory, Arizona, where the air\r\nis extraordinarily clear and telescopic vision unusually penetrating,\r\nhas stimulated the observation of the planet to a very great degree\r\nduring recent years. Mars has an atmosphere not nearly so dense as\r\nthat of the earth, but still dense enough in all probability to\r\nsupport some form of organic life. It may, for example, support\r\nvegetation. In some other respects Mars resembles the earth. It has\r\narctic circles; it has clouds, though whether these are of vapour or\r\nof dust is not quite certain; and it has a less variable temperature\r\nby far than that of the Moon. There are, at any rate, some of the\r\nconditions to support and perhaps to encourage life; and if we could\r\nbe certain that the atmosphere in Mars more nearly resembles that of\r\nthe earth, and that its temperature was such as to be sometimes above\r\nthat of our Arctic regions, then it would be difficult to deny that\r\nlife, and probably intelligent beings, existed there. One very able\r\nand intelligent astronomer is convinced that life and intelligent\r\nbeings do exist there. This is Professor Lowell, of Flagstaff\r\nObservatory, who has devoted a number of years and a great deal\r\nof money to the careful observation of the planet. He has brought\r\nforward many cogent arguments to show that Mars might be inhabited,\r\nand that great telescopes can discover signs on it, and may discover\r\nfurther signs, which are a reason for supposing it to be so. It is\r\nnot, however, within the range of this book to examine these reasons\r\nin detail; and we need only say that in the first decade of the\r\ntwentieth century most astronomers, despite the close examination\r\nof Mars and its markings, which had been conducted for more than a\r\ngeneration, were still not convinced that life as we know it could\r\nexist there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE HARDENING OF ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the time when the great overflows of lava took place, spreading\r\nover continents and sometimes seas, there was an era when the\r\nexplosions and outbursts began to diminish in violence, and the\r\nworld slowly settled down to conditions something like those which\r\nwe see in our own day. The seas were forming; there was rainfall and\r\nsummer and winter on the earth. The rains and the winds, the summer\r\nheats and winter snows were more violent than now, and the volcanic\r\nactivity of which we have spoken was much more fierce than anything\r\nof which mankind has any recollection. In the British Isles the\r\nrainfall in a year averages something in the neighbourhood of thirty\r\ninches. In some regions of the earth it is as much as four times\r\nthat amount, and deluges of fifteen inches have fallen in a day. But\r\nin the era of which we have spoken deluging rains that were to be\r\nmeasured in feet rather than inches fell incessantly. The air was\r\nsaturated with moisture, and it no sooner descended on the warm earth\r\nthan it steamed back to the clouds again. For reasons not unlike\r\nthese, nor unconnected with them, the great currents of air fed by\r\nthe constant transference of vapour from the earth to the skies, and\r\nthe condensation of the vapour to rain, falling again on the earth,\r\nwere greatly magnified. Thus the rocks of the earth, some of them\r\nonly cooling and not yet hardened, were subjected to \"weathering\"\r\nof a kind of which it is hard to form any sufficient idea. The key\r\nto all geology is that what is going on now on the earth is similar\r\nto what always has been happening, (differing in degree rather than\r\nin kind), and that consequently the rocks of millions of years ago\r\nwere washed by rivers down to the lower levels and were deposited\r\nas sediment in streams, in lakes, and in the sea. Thus the age of\r\nthe \"sedimentary rocks\" began while the earth was still too warm to\r\npreserve any vestiges of life.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes much more violent than now and volcanic outbursts often\r\nupset the steady order of things, but the earth was settling down.\r\nDuring this settling-down process rocks, as we have seen, were being\r\nformed by deposits; but they were very liable still to be invaded by\r\nbursts of volcanic activity from the inner cauldron of the earth,\r\nand they were very apt to be twisted out of their regular shape by\r\ngreat earth movements. They were also liable to be baked by the\r\nneighbourhood of the restless, unconfined molten rocks, nearer then\r\nto the surface than now. Geologists call the great period of time\r\nwhen all the rocks continually flowed out on to the surface of the\r\nearth, and were, in fact, all molten before they solidified, the\r\nArchæan Era (from a Greek word signifying the beginning). Next in\r\norder to these rocks are those which were laid down in the agitated\r\ntimes when the earth was still warm, and when the climate of the\r\nearth might be described as a continual thunderstorm. In this period\r\nearthquakes still had a great deal to do with the formation of the\r\nrocks, but then, as now, the sea and lakes and oceans laid them down.\r\nGeologists call this the Proterozoic Era. There are great masses\r\nof these Proterozoic rocks in North America. In Arizona the three\r\nperiods of rock formation are sometimes visible together, and may,\r\nindeed, be perceived in some of our photographs; the Archæan all\r\njumbled together being the lowest; Proterozoic lying crumpled or\r\ntilted over them, and the later rocks resting more regularly on these\r\nstrata. In America, however, these separate ages of the Proterozoic\r\nrocks can be identified, and each age is represented by rocks\r\nthousands of feet in thickness. Three separate ages of rocks are\r\nfound in this great era in North America. It is not very important to\r\nremember their names, which are merely those of the localities where\r\nthese great deposits are most marked, but it is important not to\r\nforget that each of these depositions of rocks represents a period in\r\nthe earth's history older than the lifetime of a river or a lake and\r\nas old as the lifetime of a continent. The lowest of these divisions\r\nconsists of rocks that are much altered by the heat of the rocks\r\nbelow. The topmost division is hardly altered at all. In Scotland we\r\nhave similar rocks. The Torridonian sandstones, 8000 to 10,000 feet\r\nthick, are believed to belong to this era. In France also, in Spain,\r\nGermany, Finland, Sweden, India, and Brazil, the Proterozoic rocks\r\nare found. In the lowermost of them are no signs that living things\r\never existed, but in the upper ones f life begin to appear. We may\r\nsee in them to-day the first fossils. A fossil means literally a\r\nthing dug up, and was a term applied at first to all kinds of mineral\r\nsubstances taken out of the earth. We use the word now exclusively\r\nfor the remains of plants and animals embedded in any kind of rock.\r\nIn later chapters of this volume a good deal will have to be said\r\nabout fossils, and of the way in which they tell us the kind of life\r\nthat existed when they were first sunk in the rocks where now they\r\nare found, and how also they give us information about the climate\r\nand the distribution of land and sea, of lake and of river, in those\r\neras far \"in the backward and the dark abyss of time.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._       _London and New York_\r\n\r\nThe Pinnacled Castle-like Peaks of the Ramshorn Mountains Of Wyoming\r\n\r\nThe successive strata of sandstone are clearly evident in the\r\npeaks.]\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, we may concern ourselves with the condition\r\nof the earth and its rocks in Proterozoic times, observing merely\r\nthat the remains of animals which we find there are of an order\r\n(Crustacea) which shows that life had progressed a good deal from\r\nits earliest beginnings in the age when the rocks containing these\r\ncrustacea were laid down. After these rocks had been deposited\r\nthey were subjected to many influences of which we have only dim\r\nconceptions. In a previous chapter we have compared the layers of\r\nthe undermost and harder rocks of the earth to the lines on a page\r\nof this book as they would appear if the pages were crumpled up into\r\na ball. Sometimes the beds of solid rock have been so distorted that\r\nthey look like waves of the sea; sometimes they have been completely\r\noverturned; hardly ever have they been suffered to lie down flat.\r\nMore than that has happened to them. Their very nature has been\r\nchanged. This was done partly by heat, partly by pressure, partly by\r\nshock.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the heat first. When a mass of erupted molten rock\r\nforces its way through the earth's crust, it produces effects which\r\nare quite easily recognised on the rocks it penetrates. Limestone\r\nbecomes hard and crystalline. Rocks with silica in them become glassy\r\nand like quartz or other hard rocks which are sometimes polished\r\nto make ornaments. Clayey strata become baked into hard brick-like\r\nrocks. The changes are not altogether due to the heat. The eruption\r\nof rocks is accompanied by steam at high pressure and with all sorts\r\nof acids in the steam, so that chemical changes are also produced.\r\nIt has been supposed by Sir William Crookes that diamonds, which are\r\ncrystals of carbon, were produced by carbon being melted at some\r\nenormous heat under great pressure. Given the requisite conditions\r\nof heat and pressure, the parts of rocks which by their chemical\r\ncomposition are susceptible to crystallisation will form into\r\nenormous crystals--not unlike the intrusive rocks themselves. They\r\ncan, however, be readily distinguished from the shapes which the\r\nintrusive rocks (like basalt) assume. The basalt rocks which form,\r\nfor example, the Giant's Causeway in Ireland were volcanic lavas.\r\nSometimes the lavas were masses which had solidified underground and\r\nhad been thrust up by pressure from below or have been exposed by the\r\nweathering of the rocks above. Sometimes they have been lava poured\r\nout on the surface. The black compact kinds most often are seen in\r\nforms like columns. If these veins of volcanic rock have been thrust\r\nup through a bed of coal, the coal is changed or \"metamorphosed\"\r\nwhere the basalt has pierced it. Sometimes it becomes hard coal like\r\nanthracite; sometimes it is changed into graphite--the black rock of\r\nwhich pencils are frequently made.\r\n\r\nLimestone pierced by basalt becomes marble. When sandstone is\r\ndiscovered in contact with ancient volcanic rock it is found to have\r\nlost its reddish colour, and to have become white, grey, green, or\r\nblack. It separates into crystals; it becomes glassy and hard. All\r\nthese instances are those of rocks which we can perceive to have been\r\naltered by coming into contact with great heat. But there is another\r\nkind of change of a very much more widespread character which can\r\nbe perceived among the most ancient of those rocks which we know\r\nmust have been first quietly laid down as sediments. It is sometimes\r\nspoken of as \"general metamorphism.\"\r\n\r\nThis widespreading change may extend over great regions and vast\r\nextents of country. The most striking series of such rocks was first\r\ndescribed by Sir W. E. Logan, Director of the Canadian Geological\r\nSurvey; and he estimated the thickness of them at 30,000 feet. They\r\nlie beneath all the unaltered rocks, and are (in North America)\r\nthe rocks which were the base or foundation of the North American\r\ncontinent before the later sedimentary rocks were laid down on them.\r\nThey are called the Laurentian rocks, because they were first found\r\nin the neighbourhood of the St. Lawrence River; but they exist in\r\nmany places besides Canada and North America; and the foundations\r\nof Scandinavia and of the Hebrides are of the same texture and\r\nmaterial. Now this change or metamorphism does not appear to be the\r\nsame as that produced by the intrusion of hot eruptive rocks. Let us\r\ntake a simple instance. We have seen that limestone is changed by\r\nheat into marble. Sometimes its fossils are preserved; sometimes they\r\ncompletely disappear. Sometimes it is threaded by veins of harder\r\nand more crystalline rocks. But in the case of the white marble of\r\nCarrara, which was once a bed of coral, the change seems to have\r\ntaken place less violently, less suddenly, more gradually. The change\r\nwas due, therefore, not to violent heat suddenly applied, but to the\r\npenetrating action of water, probably aided by sustained heat, and\r\ncertainly aided by pressure. When a rock is subjected to sufficient\r\npressure its very structure will alter; its original constituents\r\nmay be torn out of it, pressed out of it, filtered out of it, and\r\nafterwards rearranged.\r\n\r\nOnce more let us call attention to the astounding effects which great\r\npressures can have. If pressure enough be applied iron can be made to\r\nflow like treacle; and the pressure of two or three miles of strata\r\nis enough to crumple or shear or tear any rock however hard. Now we\r\nhave shown that in the earth's long history some regions are always\r\nbeing denuded of materials in order that these materials may be laid\r\ndown as sediments elsewhere. These movements may be compared to those\r\nof a pair of scales, in which we are continually taking weight from\r\nthe scale pan that is weighted in order to put it into the scale that\r\nis empty. The scale that is weighted is the land from which material\r\nis being removed by the rains and the rivers; the scale that is\r\nempty is the sea, in which the eroded material is laid down to form\r\nbeds and strata. These two scales are never quite balanced. But\r\nsuppose a time comes when we have taken all the material we can from\r\nthe weighted scale, so as to make the hitherto unweighted one the\r\nheavier--what will happen? The newly weighted scale will inevitably\r\nfall, and we shall have to begin to reverse our system of taking\r\nfrom, and adding to, the scales. Similarly there will always come\r\na time when there will be a flow of the earth-mass from the areas\r\nwhich have been receiving great loads of sediments, towards the areas\r\nwhich have been robbed to supply them. Think for a moment how the\r\nweight of a mountain set up in a plain might act if we can imagine\r\nsome giant force piling up the mountain higher and higher. The mere\r\nweight of the mountain would tend to make it settle, and begin to\r\npress outwards all round its base. If you find a difficulty in seeing\r\nhow this could be, imagine the mountain to be made of pitch. In such\r\na case we can quite easily realise how it would spread. Similarly\r\nmountains, or even great plains and plateaux, of sediment built up\r\nfor millions of years in the oceans, would tend to spread; and they\r\nwould _spread towards the land which in the first place had supplied\r\nthem with materials_. At first, of course, the stiffness or rigidity\r\nof the land would resist this spreading. But the masses thus built up\r\nwould become so great and so heavy in the course of millions of years\r\nthat no stiffness of the land could resist their spread. They would\r\nbegin to roll or slide towards the land; the heavier parts must\r\nalways roll towards the lighter. The action would be as resistless as\r\nthe slow moving onward motion of those masses of ice called glaciers;\r\nor as the movement of the great ice plains in Greenland; or of those\r\nice plains which in Antarctic regions are always spreading towards\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThere are two views of it. There is the outward pressure of the\r\nregions where the sediments of rock are being laid down. There is the\r\ninward pressure towards the regions which have lost soil. Sometimes\r\nthese two actions may conspire. A region where great denudation is\r\ntaking place may send its waste material towards the sea, where\r\nit is deposited near the coast and not far from the highlands or\r\nmountains or plateaux which founded the soil. The shallows near the\r\nshore become a belt which is being loaded; the big mountains near by\r\nare a belt which is unloading; and thus there are two strains set up\r\ntogether. It is not hard to see the enormous crumpling effect which\r\nthis would produce on the lower strata one or two miles beneath the\r\nsurface of the sea and three or four miles below the topmost crests\r\nof the mountains. These are circumstances which may not be common;\r\nbut the reader will find a quite sufficient explanation of some of\r\nthe crumpling, and many of the changes in composition and appearance\r\nof the deep-sunk rocks, if he remembers the great pressure over them,\r\nand the fact that the high regions may be supposed always to have a\r\ntendency to slip towards the lowlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES IN GEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is more than likely that earthquakes in the geological past were\r\nvery much more violent, widespread, and frequent than they are\r\nnow; and they may have had a more potent effect in overturning the\r\nrocks of the earth. Even now their effects and the circumstances\r\nwhich accompany them are tremendous and terrifying. When the\r\ngreat earthquake comes, says Major Edward Dutton in his book on\r\n_Earthquakes_, it comes quickly and is quickly gone. Its duration\r\nis generally a matter of seconds rather than of minutes, though\r\ninstances have been known in which it lasted from three to four\r\nminutes. Perhaps forty-five seconds would be a fair average. The\r\nfirst sensation is a confused murmuring sound of a strange and\r\neven weird character. Almost simultaneously loose objects begin\r\nto tremble and clatter. Sometimes almost in an instant, sometimes\r\nmore gradually, but always quickly, the sound becomes a roar, the\r\nclattering becomes a crashing. The rapid quiver grows into a rude\r\nviolent shaking of increasing amplitude. Everything beneath seems\r\nbeaten with rapid blows of measureless power; loose objects begin to\r\nfly about; those that are lightly hung break from their fastenings.\r\nThe shaking increases in violence. The floor begins to heave and rock\r\nlike a boat on the waves. Plaster ceilings fall, the walls crack, the\r\nchimneys go crashing down, everything moves, heaves, tosses. Huge\r\nwaves seem to rush under the foundations as if driven by a gale. The\r\nswing now becomes longer and still more powerful. The walls crack\r\nopen. A sudden lurch throws out the front wall into the street, or\r\ntears off or shakes down in rubble the whole corner of the building.\r\nThen comes a longer swaying motion, not unlike a ship at sea, but\r\nmore rapid; not alone from side to side, but forward and backward\r\nas well, and both motions combined with a wriggle which it seems\r\nimpossible for anything to withstand. It is this compound, figure-8\r\nmotion which is so destructive, rending asunder the strongest\r\nstructures as if they were built of clay. It is the culmination of\r\nthe quake. It settles into a more regular and less violent swing;\r\nthen suddenly abates and ceases.\r\n\r\nOut in the open country the signs and portents are of a different\r\ncharacter. The first intimation is a strange sound. Some have likened\r\nit to the sighing of pine trees in the wind, or to falling rain;\r\nothers to the distant roar of the surf; others to the far-off rumble\r\nof the railway train. It grows louder. The earth begins to quiver,\r\nthen to shake rudely. Soon the ground begins to heave. Then it is\r\nactually seen to be traversed by visible waves--something like waves\r\nat sea, but of less height and moving much more swiftly. The sound\r\nbecomes a roar. It is difficult to stand, and at length becomes\r\nimpossible to do so. People fling themselves to the ground to avoid\r\nbeing dashed against it. The trees are seen to sway violently,\r\nsometimes so much that they touch the ground with their branches....\r\nAs the waves rush past the ground opens in cracks and closes again.\r\nAs the cracks close the squeezed-out air blows out sand and gravel,\r\nand sometimes sand and water are spurted high in air. The roar\r\nbecomes appalling. Through its din are heard loud, deep, solemn booms\r\nthat seem like the voice of some higher Power speaking out of the\r\ndepths of the universe. Suddenly the storm subsides, the earth comes\r\nspeedily to rest, and all is over.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, says Major Dutton, this description suggests but a single\r\ninstance, or a few instances, of what earthquakes are like. In\r\nsome the full vigour of the shock comes with explosive suddenness.\r\nPeople find themselves suddenly thrown to the earth, the ground\r\nswept from under their feet. Sometimes the rolling waves of earth\r\nare absent, and the movement is a rude quiver, rapidly vibrating in\r\nevery direction--twisting, contorting, wrenching the ground as if\r\nin a determined effort to shake it into dust. Sometimes the most\r\npronounced motion is up and down, as if the earth beneath were being\r\nhammered with giant strokes. Sometimes the growth, the climax, the\r\ndying out of the earthquake movement are repeated before the first\r\nshocks have ceased, or a few minutes afterwards, or even with an\r\ninterval of several hours. The last-named case is, however, uncommon,\r\nthough after the first shocks of a great earthquake there are minor\r\nshocks and tremblings for days, weeks, or months afterwards. Some\r\nof these are of considerable force, though they do not inflict the\r\ndevastation of the principal earthquake. The greatest earthquakes\r\nare not always those which wreak the largest amount of destruction.\r\nEvidently an earthquake, the centre of which is situated near a great\r\ncity, is more appalling in its effects than one which takes place in\r\nsome desert place like the steppes of Siberia. Recent earthquakes\r\nin Italy and near San Francisco were regarded as great earthquakes\r\nbecause they took place in thickly populated neighbourhoods. In\r\ncities, writes Professor W. H. Hobbs, to the rumbling of the\r\nearthquake is quickly added the crash of falling masonry, and to this\r\nsucceeds an uncanny grey darkness as the air becomes filled with the\r\ndust from broken bricks, mortar, and plaster.... In places the ground\r\nopens and swallows the objects which lie upon it. Ponds are sucked\r\ndown and disappear, and great fountains of water gush out and flood\r\nthe country. During the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811 and 1812 water\r\nwas shot upwards in vertical sheets and carried to the tops of the\r\nhighest trees. Near Lake Baikal, during the earthquake on January\r\n26th, 1862, the surface of the steppe, over two hundred square miles,\r\nwas suddenly dropped; fountains opened at many parts within the\r\nsunken area, and water shot up to heights of twenty feet. The water\r\ngushed also in great volume from the open wells, and where these were\r\ntightly covered by wooden caps, their lids were shot up into the air\r\nlike corks from champagne bottles. On the night of September 5th,\r\n1896, during heavy earthquake shocks in Iceland, a new warm spring\r\nsuddenly opened to the accompaniment of loud roaring and whistling,\r\nand threw water, steam, and fragments of rock to a height estimated\r\nat six hundred feet. The force of the new geyser was, however,\r\nsoon spent, and ten days later it ceased to flow. Nearly all the\r\nIcelandic geysers suffered changes during this earthquake, and the\r\nfamous _Strokkur_, which had been born during the earthquake of 1789,\r\nsuddenly ceased its eruption and came to an end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nA Geyser in Action\r\n\r\nIn geysers the suggestion that the fountains of steam and hot water\r\noriginate by the contact of water with hot rock is irresistible.]\r\n\r\nIn steep-walled mountain valleys earthquakes nearly always cause\r\nlandslips, and these may completely block the course of a river. The\r\nlake formed in this manner during the great earthquake of January\r\n25th, 1348, in Carinthia destroyed no fewer than seventeen villages,\r\nand to-day, nearly six centuries afterwards, the area is a great\r\nmarsh. After the earthquake near Lake Baikal in Siberia, of which\r\nwe have spoken and in which the ground sank, the sunken area was\r\nsoon after invaded by the waters of the lake. Sometimes when the\r\nearthquake takes place near the mouth of a great river, the channels\r\nof the streams are changed. After the Californian earthquake of\r\n1857 the current of the River Kern was turned upstream; and the San\r\nGabriel River left its bed to follow a new course offered to it\r\nby an earthquake fissure. After the Japanese earthquake of 1891 a\r\nformer lake was cut in half by one of the earthquake displacements,\r\nand one half of the lake was left high and dry. Near Flagstaff,\r\nArizona, there is an old earthquake crack along which the waters of\r\nseveral rivers which intersect it all disappear down the crevice.\r\nThe most remarkable revelation of the process of lake draining\r\nduring earthquake shocks was furnished, however, according to\r\nProfessor Hobbs, by the former Lake Eulalie near New Madrid. After\r\nthe shocks of 1812 the lake completely disappeared. On the lake\r\nbottom thus exposed there was revealed a series of fissures down the\r\nfunnel-shaped openings which the waters had disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from many of the foregoing instances that whatever\r\nare the principal causes of earthquakes, they must have played a\r\ngreat part in the shaping of events in the geological past; and\r\nthe only limitation which we can place in the importance of the\r\npart they played will depend on whether we regard the earthquake\r\nas having been caused by a movement of the underlying strata, or\r\nwhether we believe that the same cause which produces earthquakes\r\nmay produce alterations in the lie of the strata themselves. In the\r\nnext chapter we shall describe some of the effects produced on land\r\nby earthquakes. But impressive as some of these effects are, it is\r\nby no means certain that the greatest earthquakes take place on land\r\nat all. They may take place at sea, deep underneath the ocean. Our\r\nopportunities for observing such quakes, however, are much smaller\r\nthan are afforded by land earthquakes. The instruments which have\r\nbeen devised for observing earth tremors will measure the smallest\r\nof such disturbances, and will record earthquakes the centres of\r\nwhich are thousands of miles away. These delicate instruments often\r\nrecord distant earthquakes, the exact locality of which is never\r\ndetermined. No doubt, some of these distant tremors originate in the\r\nocean bed; but the seaquake can only be localised when the water is\r\nput into a state of vibration sufficiently energetic to rock the ship\r\nand its loose objects and thus affect the senses. Vast waves are\r\nsometimes rolled in on the shores of continents, and are undoubtedly\r\ncaused by some great disturbance beneath the ocean.\r\n\r\nSuch waves have been known through a long period of history in the\r\nEastern Mediterranean, where they have ravaged the shores of Syria\r\nand Asia Minor; and it is sometimes supposed that the great deluge on\r\nwhich the Ark of Noah floated was accompanied by a mighty sea-wave,\r\nrolled in upon the lands of Chaldea from the Persian Gulf. Off the\r\nPacific coast of South America these waves arise most often and most\r\nmightily. They have been especially formidable in the angle where\r\nthe coast of Peru meets that of Chili, and the harbours of Pisco,\r\nArica, Tacna, Iquique, and Pisagua have been repeatedly subjected\r\nto these destructive invasions. Usually they are foreshadowed by a\r\nviolent earthquake, and the inhabitants, taking warning, fly to the\r\nhills. The sea-wave does not, however, always follow the earthquake,\r\nbut it appears often enough to arouse serious fear that it may come\r\nwhenever the ground is strongly shaken. The first sign of the coming\r\ndisaster is the withdrawal of the sea from the shore, leaving bare\r\nthe bed of the harbour. A few minutes later the sea returns in a\r\nhigh, irresistible wave, which overflows the adjoining lands. Again\r\nit withdraws and again returns, and these oscillations may last for\r\nmany hours, slowly diminishing in the amount of rise and fall till\r\nthey die out.\r\n\r\nThe most memorable seaquake of the Chilian coast was that of August\r\n13th, 1868, when the coast of South America was shaken from Ecuador\r\nto Valdivia. In the town of Arica most of the buildings were thrown\r\ndown. A few minutes later the sea began to retire slowly from the\r\nshore, so that ships anchored in seven fathoms of water were left\r\nhigh and dry. Then the sea returned like a great wall of water, which\r\ncaught up the ships in the roadstead and swept them inland like chips\r\nof wood. Among them was the United States war vessel _Wateree_,\r\nwhich was carried inland nearly half a mile and was left, little\r\ninjured, on dry land when again the wave receded. The wave of this\r\ncatastrophe was felt far away from Chili. It was perceived on the\r\ncoasts of Australasia, Japan, Kamchatka, Alaska, and California. In\r\nthe harbour of Hakodate, in Japan, a series of waves was registered\r\non the tide-gauge. The ordinary tide in that port is only about two\r\nand a half to three feet. On this occasion the water rose and fell\r\na height of ten feet in twenty minutes. It had taken the first wave\r\ntwenty-five hours to travel the distance of 7600 miles from South\r\nAmerica. On May 9th, 1877, another seaquake almost as great as this\r\nwas felt in many of the same places. This was on the occasion of the\r\nIquique earthquake. At Arica the stranded hulk of the _Wateree_,\r\nwhich had remained high and dry for nine years, was picked up and\r\nswept farther inland. Like its predecessor, the wave was felt all\r\nover the Pacific. At Samoa the height of the waves varied from six\r\nto twelve feet; in New Zealand from three to twenty feet; in Japan\r\nfrom five to ten feet.\r\n\r\nWhen a wave reaches shallow water it piles itself up to a height, as\r\nany one knows who has watched the waves coming in on the sea-shore,\r\nso that the height of a wave measured on the tide-gauge of a seaport\r\nis a good deal greater than that of the height of the wave when it\r\nis far out on the ocean. In fact, the mid-ocean height of the wave\r\nis likely to be inches while the in-shore wave is measured in feet.\r\nAn illustration of this can be seen on the coast of Cornwall, where\r\nsometimes, on quite a calm day the sea that looks so still breaks\r\non the shore in big rollers. We cannot tell exactly how high an\r\nearthquake wave may be in mid-ocean, but we know it cannot usually be\r\nvery great, though it travels at great speeds--sometimes as much as\r\nfive miles a minute, or three hundred miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThus we should not expect that ships far out at sea would often\r\nnotice seaquakes unless the quake took place very near them. There\r\nare, however, some instances. Captain Gales, of the ship _Florence\r\nNightingale_, reported that on January 25th, 1859, while near St.\r\nPaul's Rocks, not far from the Equator, \"we felt a strong shock of\r\nan earthquake. It began with a rumbling sound like distant thunder\r\nand lasted about forty seconds. I was quite well acquainted with\r\nearthquakes, as I had experienced a good many on the west coast of\r\nAmerica, but never had I felt so severe a one. Glass and dishes\r\nrattled so vigorously that I was surprised to find them uninjured.\r\nA good many objects fell down, and it was as if the ship were\r\ngrounding on a reef.\" Another report from a locality not far from\r\nthis speaks of a strange submarine noise not unlike distant thunder,\r\nor still more like the distant firing of heavy guns. At the same time\r\nthere was a vibration of the ship as though the anchor had been let\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are representative of the large majority of the reports\r\nof seaquakes. The ship quivers, vibrates; loose objects clatter and\r\ntumble. There is a strange thunderous noise in the sea. The first\r\nimpression is as if the ship were grinding upon the bottom, and\r\nthere is an instinctive rush of the crew to the deck to see if the\r\nship is not on a reef. In some instances there are some forcible\r\ndisturbances. M. Vulet d'Aourst speaks of a seaquake so severe that\r\n\"the Admiral feared the complete destruction of the corvette.\" Heavy\r\nobjects, including cannon and their carriages, were thrown upon the\r\ndeck. The ship itself seemed to be hurled upwards.\r\n\r\nOne of the explanations offered of a phenomenon such as the last\r\ndescribed is that the vessel has been near a submarine volcanic\r\neruption of great power. The places where some or most of the\r\nseaquakes have been observed have been charted, and certain districts\r\nof the ocean have been found to produce more of these disturbances\r\nthan others. Among the first to be thus determined were two, located\r\nin the Atlantic Ocean, very near the Equator and nearly midway\r\nbetween Cape Palmas on the southeastern coast of Liberia and Cape\r\nSt. Roque, Brazil. One of them is the St. Paul's Rocks district,\r\nof which mention has already been made. Another district from which\r\nseaquakes have been reported with exceptional frequency is the North\r\nAtlantic in the neighbourhood of the Azores. Between these islands\r\nand the coast of Portugal it may be remembered that the great quake\r\noriginated which, on November 1st, 1775, destroyed Lisbon. The West\r\nIndian Deep, that profound basin of the Atlantic lying north of the\r\nLesser Antilles and east of the Bahamas, where the Atlantic has its\r\ngreatest depths and where its bottom has its greatest inequalities,\r\nis another district from which an unusual number of seaquakes have\r\nbeen reported. The usual explanation of their origin is that in these\r\nneighbourhoods, owing to the great pressure of water above them,\r\nthere are continual slips and fractures of the sea bottom, like\r\nlandslips on land, and that into the great cavities thus produced the\r\nwater rushes, and thus sets up disturbances which show themselves\r\non the surface like waves, very much in the same way that the water\r\nrushing through the escape of a bath produces small disturbances on\r\nthe surface of the water in the bath. To satisfy the requirements of\r\nsuch a wave as rolled in upon the South American coast at Arica in\r\n1868 would require the sudden drop of many hundred square miles of\r\nsea bottom--perhaps of several thousand square miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSOME FAMOUS EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all earthquakes perhaps the best known and remembered is that of\r\nLisbon on November 1st, 1755, and volumes have been written about it.\r\nThe first shocks of this earthquake came without other warning than a\r\ndeep sound resembling thunder, which appeared to proceed from beneath\r\nthe ground, and it was immediately followed by a quaking which threw\r\ndown the entire city of Lisbon. In six minutes sixty thousand persons\r\nperished. The day was almost immediately turned into night, owing\r\nto the thickness of the dust from the ruined city. A few minutes\r\nafterwards fire sprang up among the ruins. The new Lisbon quay, which\r\nhad been built entirely of marble, suddenly sank down into the bay\r\nwith an immense crowd of people, who thronged to it for safety, and\r\nit is said that none of the bodies of the drowned were ever seen\r\nagain. Following hard on the first shocks the sea retired from the\r\nland, carrying boats and other craft with it, only to return in a\r\ngreat wave, which completed the destruction in and about the city.\r\nThis great sea wave, the mightiest that has ever been described in\r\nconnection with an earthquake, is said to have washed not only the\r\ncoasts of Portugal and Spain, but to have extended with destructive\r\nviolence to other countries. At Kinsale, in Ireland, it was strong\r\nenough to whirl vessels about in the harbour and to pour into the\r\nmarket-place, and it was of great violence also at the island of\r\nMadeira. Portions of the sea-coast between Cape-da-Roca and Cape\r\nCarvociro fell away into the sea, and the damage was very great along\r\nthe coast between Cape St. Vincent and the mouth of the Guadiana. The\r\ngreat Sierra da Estrella, on the west of the Tagus valley, was split\r\nand rent in a most remarkable manner, and threw down avalanches of\r\nrock into the valley.\r\n\r\nThe great earthquake which shook Calabria and North-Eastern Sicily\r\nin the year 1783 stands out in rather striking contrast with other\r\ndisturbances of history, because it was carefully studied by a\r\ngreat number of skilled observers. Among them were Vivenzio, the\r\ncourt physician of the King of Naples, who has supplied us with a\r\nnarrative of the events; Grimaldi, the Minister of War, who at the\r\nKing's command visited the region and has left accurate measurements\r\nof the greater and lesser fissures associated with the earthquake;\r\nPignaturo, a physician, who kept a record of the long-continuing\r\nshocks, together with an estimate of their intensities; the French\r\ngeologist Dolomieu; and Sir William Hamilton, who was the British\r\nAmbassador at Naples. The Academy of Naples sent a special commission\r\nto the scene of the earthquake's destruction, and prepared a bulky\r\nreport of great scientific value. Calabria is a country which has\r\nmany times been racked with earthquakes; the disturbances being\r\nalmost as conspicuous for number as in Japan. The areas shaken have\r\nnot usually been great in extent, but as regards the geological\r\nchanges and the loss to life by which they have been accompanied,\r\nthey rank among the greatest in history.\r\n\r\nThe shocks of 1783, which cost thirty thousand lives, came without\r\nwarning on February 5th, and in two minutes threw down the structures\r\nin hundreds of cities and villages scattered through Calabria\r\nand North-Eastern Sicily. The great central granite formation of\r\nCalabria, which was but slightly disturbed by the first shock, was\r\nmore heavily shaken by those which followed; and it was noted by the\r\nearly writers on this earthquake that the mountains had been a little\r\nraised in comparison with the neighbouring plains at their bases.\r\nThe fact of the elevation of mountains by earthquakes or some other\r\nunderground disturbance has been elsewhere noted. On November 19th,\r\n1822, a great earthquake shook the Chilian coast for a distance of\r\ntwelve hundred miles north and south. The greatest energy was shown\r\nabout one hundred miles north of Valparaiso, where the coast was\r\nfound to have risen suddenly from three to five feet for a distance\r\nwhich has never been accurately ascertained, but which is known\r\nto have exceeded thirty-five miles. In 1835 and in 1837 similar\r\nelevations of the coast were caused by earthquakes at Concepcion,\r\nabout three hundred miles south of Valparaiso, and at Valdivia,\r\nabout two hundred miles south of Concepcion. Charles Darwin, in the\r\n_Voyage of the \"Beagle,\"_ says: \"I have convincing proofs that this\r\npart of the continent of South America has been elevated near the\r\ncoast at least from four to five hundred feet, and in some parts from\r\none thousand to thirteen hundred feet, since the epoch of living\r\nshells.\" Darwin finds his evidence in the raised beaches near the\r\ncoast on which these shells abound. That this uplift has been going\r\non by small and sudden movements, from a foot to ten feet at each\r\nshock, for more than two centuries is attested by good evidence.\r\nThe coast in many places is proven to be from twenty to thirty feet\r\nhigher to-day than it was in the middle of the seventeenth century.\r\nSir Charles Lyell, in his _Principles of Geology_, gives a most\r\ninteresting account of the sudden upheaval of a portion of a mountain\r\nrange, with the accompaniment of a great earthquake, near Wellington,\r\nin New Zealand, in January, 1855. Both the North and South Islands of\r\nthat colony have been affected by upliftings during the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and these movements have been attended by powerful and\r\nfar-reaching earthquakes. The changes wrought by these movements on\r\nthe shores and farther inland as well have been remarkable during the\r\nlast hundred years.\r\n\r\nAnother example of the same kind of activity is seen in the\r\noccasional rise of islands from the sea; but to this we shall refer\r\nagain, and for the present we may return to the Calabrian earthquake,\r\nwhich presented many curious and many characteristic features.\r\nDuring the earthquake the surface of the country heaved in great\r\nundulations, which were productive of a feeling of sea-sickness, and\r\nwhich, according to some observers, made the clouds appear to stand\r\nstill, as they will sometimes seem to do from the deck of a tossing\r\nship. The fissures which appeared in the ground were numbered by\r\nthousands, and sometimes the displacements of the earth amounted to\r\nas much as ten feet. Houses were lifted high up; in other places the\r\nland or the sea-floor sank several feet. Many of the fissures opened,\r\nspurted out sand or water, and then closed again; and some of the\r\nCalabrian plains after the earthquake were found to be dotted with\r\ncircular hollows, on the average about the size of carriage wheels,\r\nwhich were like wells, but were sometimes filled with sand instead\r\nof water. These were afterwards found to be =V=-shaped. In addition\r\nto these hundreds of small cone-shaped hollows or wells there were\r\nother water basins more deserving the name of ponds or lakes. One of\r\nthese in the neighbourhood of Seminara, to which the name of Lago di\r\nTolfilo was given, was about a third of a mile in length, and was so\r\ncopiously fed by the springs ranged in a fissure in its bottom that\r\nall attempts to drain it proved useless. Near Sitizam a valley was\r\ncompletely choked up by the landslip from opposite sides, and behind\r\nthis new dam a lake was formed which was about two miles in length\r\nand one mile in breadth. Vivenzio states that fifty lakes arose\r\nat the time of the earthquake, and the Government surveyors, who\r\nincluded ponds, counted no fewer than 215. The first effect of the\r\nmore violent shocks was generally to dry up the rivers. Immediately\r\nafterwards many of their beds were so blocked up over them that the\r\nrivers overflowed. From the rock of Scylla opposite to Charybdis, in\r\nthe Straits of Messina, large sections of cliff were broken off,\r\nin one instance for a whole mile's length of coast. The sea and the\r\nneighbourhood was greatly disturbed; and soon after the fall of the\r\ncliffs of Scylla the sea rose to a height of twenty feet, and the\r\nwave rolling over the coast-line drowned 1500 people.\r\n\r\nJapan is perhaps as unstable an area as anywhere exists on the\r\nearth, and the records of its earthquakes are more complete than in\r\nany other country. The number of destructive earthquakes recorded\r\nthere in the last fifteen hundred years is 223. Since the beginning\r\nof the seventeenth century the records are fairly perfect, and it\r\nis found that since then a destructive earthquake has occurred\r\nsomewhere in the Japanese islands nearly every two and a half years.\r\nFor the lighter shocks systematic observation has become necessary,\r\nand the Japanese, with that development of the scientific spirit\r\nwhich is so remarkable an accompaniment of their progress during the\r\nlast generation, have organised an Earthquake Recording Service--a\r\nSeismological Bureau--at which such conspicuous meteorologists as Mr.\r\nJohn Milne and Dr. Knott have worked, and which has produced great\r\nseismologists among the Japanese themselves. As many of our readers\r\nare aware, the earth is hardly ever still; it trembles continually\r\nlike a boiling kettle, though not for the same reasons; and the\r\ndelicate instruments for measuring earthquakes, which are called\r\nseismometers, show continual earth tremors or earth shivers. Since\r\n1888 the earthquakes of all intensities recorded in Japan give a\r\nyearly average of 1447 shocks, or a daily average of four. Until the\r\ngreat earthquake of 1891, the greatest shocks within the memory of\r\nliving men were those of 1854-5.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake of October 28th, 1891, shook an area of 243,000\r\nsquare miles, or more than three-fifths of the entire area of Japan,\r\nthough the greatest damage was done on the Mino-Owari Plain, a\r\nbroad expanse of country occupied by rice fields and surrounded by\r\nmountains. Without the least warning the blow came, and in the first\r\nshock 20,000 buildings fell, 7000 people were killed and 17,000 were\r\ninjured. Innumerable fissures great and small appeared all over the\r\nplain, and the houses in the thickly packed villages fell like packs\r\nof cards. The plain is one of Japan's great gardens, and supported\r\nalmost 1000 people to the square mile. Villages were thereabout\r\ncontinuous, and a narrow lane of unusual destruction could be traced\r\nthrough them for twenty miles. After the first shock there were\r\nnumerous smaller ones, and during the next five months no fewer than\r\n256 shocks were recorded in all. Among the more remarkable effects\r\nof the earthquake was the actual shifting of the country. Along a\r\ncrack many miles in length the plain after the earthquake was some\r\nfeet lower on one side than on the other. Reservoirs and swamps were\r\nformed, as well as sand pits and mud craters. The most conspicuous\r\neffect, however, from a geological standpoint was the shifting and\r\ndistortion of the strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photo, G. C. Niven_\r\n\r\nThe Curious Eruption of Mount Asama, Japan\r\n\r\nMount Asama is nearly 8000 feet high, and the crater is nearly a\r\nmile across, and has a depth of about 1000 feet. Steam is being\r\ncontinually discharged. The above display was photographed from about\r\n8 miles distance. The discharge was about 1-1/2 miles high, and shot\r\nup to that height in some ninety seconds. The evident inference\r\nis either that water is being forced out of the rocks by volcanic\r\naction, or that the eruptions are of the nature of steam explosions\r\ncaused by water which comes in contact with molten rock.]\r\n\r\nA few years later, on the 26th and 27th August, 1896, occurred\r\nthe remarkable Icelandic earthquake, which affected a triangular\r\nplateau, bordered by high mountains, including Mount Hecla and other\r\nwell-known volcanoes, in the south-western portion of the island.\r\nDuring the shocks the earth's surface was thrown into waves, so that\r\nneither man nor cattle could stand. Persons who were lying on the\r\nground near a cliff were by the shock thrown bodily over the edge. A\r\nhigh hill in the plain is described as shaken \"like a dog coming out\r\nof the water,\" and a thick mantle of loose soil which had covered it\r\nwas afterwards found distributed in heaps about its base. The surface\r\nof the plain was scarred by open fissures or by rock walls which had\r\nbeen caused by the earth's rising on one side of a fissure. One of\r\nthe fissures was nine miles and another seven miles in length. The\r\nmountains round the plains were riven by clefts, and many landslips\r\noccurred. As we have mentioned elsewhere, a new geyser was formed,\r\nthrowing up water to an enormous height, but soon spending its early\r\nforce; and many geysers and springs were violently disturbed.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake of a very different kind occurred the next year in the\r\nprovince of Assam, India (June 12th, 1897). Unlike the Icelandic\r\nearthquake, almost the whole damage was here the result of the first\r\nshock. Everything was destroyed within the first fifteen seconds of\r\nthe earthquake, and the heavy shocks had all passed before two and\r\na half minutes had elapsed. In this brief space of time an area of\r\n1,750,000 square miles had been shaken and 150,000 square miles laid\r\nin ruins. A member of the Geological Survey of India, who was in\r\nthe town of Shillong, says that a rumbling sound like near thunder\r\npreceded the shocks by a second or so and increased in loudness,\r\nso that when masonry began to fall the noise and rattle of the\r\nfalling stones were hardly to be perceived. Unable to stand on his\r\nfeet, this observer sat down on the ground, and not only felt but\r\nsaw the ground thrown into violent waves as if \"composed of soft\r\njelly.\" These waves seemed to run along the ground. When the shocks\r\nhad passed all the masonry houses in Shillong had been levelled to\r\nthe ground, and over each hung a cloud of pink plaster particles\r\nand dust. Some of the shocks seem to have occurred with a kind of\r\ntwist, and stone monuments were given the appearance of corkscrews.\r\nThere were left many fissures and depressions in the ground, and\r\nthe rivers and lakes and streams were greatly affected. Thirty new\r\nlakes were formed; along the great Brahmaputra River rolled a great\r\nwave ten feet high. One great rent in the geological strata at the\r\nearth's surface was twelve miles long. Important changes of level\r\nof great blocks of country were clearly shown by the alterations in\r\nthe aspect of the landscape. Ranges of hills which before had not\r\nbeen visible from certain points now came into view for the first\r\ntime, while others had disappeared. Though the most destructive shock\r\nwas that felt during the first few seconds, there were others which\r\nfollowed, lasting for nearly a week afterwards. This earthquake is of\r\nspecial interest, because it was the first one which was registered\r\non the earthquake instruments set up in Europe. Since that date\r\nthese instruments have been set up all over the world, and, as we\r\nsay elsewhere, a great earthquake is now usually recorded on the\r\nseismometers and seismographic instruments set up in observatories\r\nstationed thousands of miles away.\r\n\r\nAll of our readers will recollect the Jamaica earthquake which\r\noccurred comparatively recently. Port Kingston, in Jamaica, has had\r\nits share of earthquake disasters. In the year 1692 Port Royal, the\r\nthen chief city, was destroyed, and in rebuilding it the Jamaicans\r\nmoved it across the harbour, because the old town site was largely\r\nsubmerged beneath the sea. It was a recurrence of the settlement\r\nof the ground which in part produced the earthquake of January\r\n14th, 1907. There were slight shocks preceding the earthquake, and\r\nsubterranean rumblings. The chief damage was done before thirty-five\r\nseconds had gone by, and of course the catastrophe was greater\r\nbecause the shocks were felt in the neighbourhood of a city.\r\nConsidered by itself the earthquake was not of the order of \"great\"\r\nearthquakes, but many of the effects were most curious. A statue of\r\nQueen Victoria on a pedestal was partly turned round; a series of\r\nsteep terraces was formed by the side of the harbour; a small spring\r\nwas converted into a stream eight feet wide; and, as we all know,\r\nvery great destruction was inflicted on life and property. Soundings\r\nwhich have since then been made in the harbour show that its depth\r\nhas greatly increased in some parts, in one instance by not less\r\nthan twenty-seven feet. The greatest depression occurred near Port\r\nRoyal (the old city), where a hundred yards or more of the ground was\r\nsubmerged by water varying from eight to twenty-five feet in depth.\r\n\r\nProceeding northwards from the Antilles to North America, we come\r\nto other famous areas of earthquake disturbance. In 1811 and 1812\r\nthere were earthquakes along the lower lands of the great Mississippi\r\nRiver, which were felt throughout the whole of the eastern portion\r\nof the United States and as far west as exploration had gone. At\r\nNew Madrid, which appears to have been near the centre of the\r\ndisturbance, \"subterranean thunder\" appears to have been heard\r\nfrequently for many years preceding the earthquake, though it had\r\nceased for nearly a year. About two o'clock in the morning of\r\nDecember 16th, 1811, there came a severe shock accompanied by a noise\r\nwhich was like near thunder, and a few minutes afterwards the air was\r\nfilled with sulphurous vapour. People thought that the end of the\r\nworld had come. Light shocks were felt till sunrise; and then one\r\nmore violent than the first occurred. But this was not the end. For\r\nthree months the shocks went on, and in that time no fewer than 1874\r\nshocks were recorded, eight of them great ones. The shock of January\r\n23rd, though as violent as any that preceded it, was surpassed by\r\nthe so-called \"hard shock,\" which came at about four o'clock in the\r\nafternoon of February 7th. It was accompanied by a discharge of\r\nsulphurous vapour in the atmosphere, and an unusual darkness which\r\nadded greatly to the terror of the people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nA House destroyed by an Earthquake\r\n\r\nThis was Senator Stanford's house at Palo Alto, about 25 miles from\r\nSan Francisco, which is situated on a fault or ancient fracture of\r\nthe earth's surface.]\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi seemed to recede from its banks, and its waters\r\ngathered up like mountains, leaving boats high up on the sands. \"The\r\nwaters then moved inwards with a front wall fifteen to twenty feet\r\nin height, tearing the boats from their moorings and carrying them\r\nclosely packed up a creek for a quarter of a mile. The river fell\r\nas rapidly as it had risen, and receded from its banks with such\r\nviolence that it took with it a grove of cotton-woods which hedged\r\nits borders. These trees were broken off with such regularity that\r\nit was hard to persuade people who had not witnessed the catastrophe\r\nthat it had not been brought about by human agency.\" During all the\r\ngreater shocks the earth's surface was reported to have been raised\r\nin great crumplings, the crests of which opened into fissures. Some\r\nof these were six hundred to seven hundred feet long and twenty\r\nto thirty feet wide, and water and sand and even coal[13] were\r\nspouted out of them to a height of forty feet. Many craters and\r\nholes in the ground were formed, surrounded by rings of sand; and\r\ntraces of them remain to this day, a century-old monument of the\r\ndestruction wrought. Notable changes in the level of the country were\r\neffected; new lakes and new islands came into existence; some lakes\r\ndisappeared; some of the lakes then formed remain to this day. On\r\nthe eastern bank of the Mississippi a lake a hundred miles long, six\r\nmiles wide, and ten to fifty feet in depth was formed; and another\r\nlake, known now as Reelfoot Lake, which came then into existence,\r\nis twenty miles long, seven miles broad--larger than Windermere,\r\nand deeper. The fishermen's boats to-day float over the top of\r\neighteenth-century cypress trees. In addition to sections of country\r\nwhich were depressed and submerged, an area of some twenty miles in\r\ndiameter was elevated into a low dune twenty to twenty-five feet\r\nabove the level of the plain of the Mississippi. Many years after the\r\ngreat shocks, smaller ones were felt; and even now scarcely a year\r\npasses without slight tremors in this region, and small fissures are\r\nstill formed in the ground.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Or \"lignite,\" a form of hard pitch.]\r\n\r\nIt must be repeated that the great earthquakes are not those of\r\nwhich most is heard. The earthquake of San Francisco which did such\r\nwidespread damage because it took place in the neighbourhood of a\r\nthickly populated city was, after all, less in magnitude than the\r\nSonora earthquake of 1887, which took place in a great expanse of\r\ndesert country in which few people lived and few towns had been\r\nbuilt. But this earthquake was felt all over the countries of Mexico\r\nand the State of Arizona; and a range of mountains, the Sierra Teras,\r\nwas uplifted between faults which opened upon either side. Millions\r\nof cubic feet of rock were thrown down from the slopes of the\r\nmountains into the deep cañons and water-courses, and cliffs of hard\r\nrock were shattered and split as though by a charge of giant powder.\r\nThe Yakutat Bay earthquake in Alaska changed the whole face of the\r\ncountry over thousands of square miles during September, 1899; and\r\nalong the shore of the bay the shore showed that in some cases it had\r\nbeen lifted from five to thirty and in some cases even fifty feet.\r\nNew reefs and islands were formed; and a study of the country and the\r\ncoast-line seems to show that from time to time this neighbourhood,\r\nlike the beaches south of Valparaiso, is being lifted by some agency,\r\nperhaps the gradual elevation of a continent, perhaps by continuous\r\nearthquake action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nThe Ruins of the Magnificent City Hall of San Francisco\r\n\r\nThe great earthquake of 1906 caused this destruction. Some of the\r\ndistortive effects of an earthquake movement can be perceived.]\r\n\r\nBut if the San Francisco earthquake of April 18th, 1906, was not of\r\nitself a very great earthquake, it brought about an enormous amount\r\nof damage. The heavy shocks came without warning at about five\r\no'clock in the morning of April 18th. They lasted about a minute, and\r\nthen went off into lighter quakes, which were felt till evening, and\r\nfor many days after, gradually growing smaller and smaller. The loss\r\nof life, though great, was but a tenth of what it would have been had\r\nthe worst shocks come at a later hour when men were at their places\r\nof business and the children in school. As it was, the greatest loss\r\nwas due to the fire which was started by the earthquake, and which\r\nwas soon beyond control, because the water-main had been snapped by\r\nthe earth movement. The cause of the earthquake has been generally\r\nassigned to the slipping of the strata of California. Athwart the\r\nwhole state runs a straight furrow, like an ancient earthquake crack\r\nof primeval times, which is about four hundred miles long, and the\r\nrocks about which are still liable to slip. As we have said, however,\r\nthe Californian earthquake, though accompanied by great destruction\r\nof property, and by the characteristic accompaniments of fissures in\r\nthe ground, and slight elevations and depressions of the country over\r\na line sixty miles long, was not a very profound earthquake.\r\n\r\nRather a curious coincidence may be here noted. We have spoken of\r\nsubmarine earthquakes and volcanoes and of islands which are raised\r\nby something akin to volcanic action or earthquake action underneath\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nSome weeks after the Californian earthquake the officers and crew\r\nof the U.S. Fish Commission steamer _Albatross_, while on their way\r\nto investigate, with Professor Charles H. Gilbert, the fisheries of\r\nJapan, passed the group of islands known as the Bogoslofs, and to\r\ntheir astonishment perceived that a third island had been added to\r\nthe other two. Professor Gilbert, in a letter concerning the first\r\nsight of the island, on May 28th, wrote: \"When I saw the Bogoslofs\r\nin 1890 there were really two small islands about 1-1/2 miles apart,\r\none of them steaming and the other cooled off. This has been the\r\ncondition for a number of years, so the hot one had received the name\r\nof Fire Island, the cold one, Castle Island. When they came in sight\r\nyesterday, we were astonished to find that Fire Island was no longer\r\nsmoking, and that a very large third island had arisen half-way\r\nbetween the other two. It was made of jagged, rugged lava, and was\r\ngiving off clouds of steam and smoke from any number of little\r\ncraters scattered all over it. Around these craters the rocks were\r\nall crusted with yellow sulphur. The new cone, occupying much of the\r\nspace between the two older ones, was somewhat higher than either,\r\nbut was certainly far from 900 feet high--300 feet would be an\r\nextreme figure. There was no evidence of a central crater. The steam\r\nand fumes were given off most abundantly from cracks and fumaroles\r\non the slopes. About these were heavy incrustations of sulphur. We\r\nsaw no indications of boiling water, nor did we believe that landing\r\nwould be impossible.\"\r\n\r\nAll three of these Bogoslof islands, which are about 120 miles\r\nsouth of the Pribyloff Islands, belonging to Russia in the Behring\r\nSea, have risen above the waters hot and steaming in the last 150\r\nyears. The oldest Bogoslof, now called Castle Island, rose from the\r\nsea in 1796; and Kotzebue describes the first glimpse of it, as\r\nseen by a trader, named Krinkof, who had been forced to seek refuge\r\nfrom a storm on a neighbouring island. The birth of the volcanic\r\nislet was accompanied by an earthquake which shook the island\r\nwhere the trader had taken refuge, and by an outburst of fire with\r\nthunderous explosions. The island was said to emit fire for months\r\nafterwards, and for eight years afterwards the water round it was\r\nwarm and its ashes unbearably hot. The eruption of 1883, in which\r\nthe second Bogoslof, called Fire Island, was born, had no witnesses;\r\nbut in September of that year great volumes of steam and smoke,\r\naccompanied by showers of ashes, were thrown out from the summit\r\nand through fissures in the sides and base, the bright reflections\r\nfrom the heated interior being visible at night. At the time of this\r\neruption a severe earthquake was felt in the sea off Cape Mendocino,\r\napparently in the line of the Californian furrow or rift.\r\n\r\nThe islands were visited in 1884 by the officers of the U.S. revenue\r\ncutter _Corwin_, and Lieutenant J. C. Cantwell and Surgeon H. W.\r\nYemans made the ascent of New Bogoslof. Lieutenant Cantwell thus\r\ndescribes his experience in the _Cruise of the Corwin_:--\r\n\r\n\"The sides of New Bogoslof rise with a gentle slope to the crater.\r\nThe ascent at first appears easy, but a thin layer of ashes, formed\r\ninto a crust by the action of rain and moisture, is not strong enough\r\nto sustain a man's weight. At every step my feet crushed through the\r\nouter covering and I sank at first ankle deep, and later on knee\r\ndeep, into a soft, almost impalpable dust, which arose in clouds and\r\nnearly suffocated me. As the summit was reached the heat of the ashes\r\nbecame unbearable.... On all sides of the cone there are openings\r\nthrough which steam escaped with more or less energy.\"\r\n\r\nSeven years after that Drs. Merriam and Mendenhall, of the Behring\r\nSea Seal Commission, found the newer island still smoking, steaming,\r\nand occasionally roaring like a giant steam escape. The older island\r\nhad quite cooled, and had become a sheer cliff or hill of cold ashes,\r\nand was, and is, the home of countless sea birds, as well as of a\r\nsmall herd of sea lions. Captain Cook, in the eighteenth century, had\r\npassed by the neighbourhood of this island. This was eighteen years,\r\nhowever, before it was born, and he named a pillar of ash or rock\r\nwhich he found there Ship Rock. Ship Rock fell in ruins five years\r\nafter the birth of Fire Island.\r\n\r\nSince that time the new island has again sunk beneath the waves.\r\nBut it will probably rise again, or another island somewhere in its\r\nneighbourhood will take its place, for a great new submarine ridge of\r\nvolcanic rocks is forming in this neighbourhood and has been forming\r\nfor many hundreds of years. The Pribyloff Islands are known to be\r\nvolcanic from the materials of which they are composed, and sprang up\r\nabove the waves in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF EARTHQUAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that we have before us some of the examples of the changes which\r\nhistoric earthquakes have brought about in the face of the country,\r\nit is easy to see what an important effect they must have exerted\r\nin geological history. But there are still weighty questions to be\r\nanswered about earthquakes. We have seen that an earthquake can\r\ncontort, upset, and twist the surface strata of the earth as easily\r\nas we can crumple a sheet of cardboard. We have yet to find whether\r\nthe crumpling of the strata is always _produced_ by earthquakes, or\r\nwhether an earthquake is the culminating symptom that some agency\r\nis at work crumpling the strata. Let us try to imagine an example\r\non a small scale. Suppose we take the top of a pill-box, and,\r\nholding it in the crook between our thumb and forefinger, compress\r\nit very tightly on all sides. What will happen? The lid of the\r\npill-box, being subjected to stress or strain on all sides, will\r\npresently buckle and crack. We shall have produced an earthquake on\r\na small scale, and there will be an earthquake fracture--perhaps an\r\nearthquake fissure. If the whole pill-box had been used for the\r\npurpose of our experiment, and had been packed to the brim with\r\nointment or thick liquid, and if it had been squeezed in a vice\r\ninstead of in our hands, then perhaps we should have provoked still\r\nmore striking symptoms of an earthquake. The ointment might have\r\nbroken out through the lid. Perhaps even tiny jagged holes or craters\r\nwould have been formed in the lid. Thus we see how strain may produce\r\nearthquakes. Take some more examples. Suppose a cork is very tightly\r\nfixed in a wine bottle, and in order to get it out we employ a very\r\npowerful lever corkscrew. The neck of the bottle, under the effect\r\nof the too powerful pressure put on the inside surface of the glass,\r\nwill crack or break. Similarly if we screw down a microscope too\r\nhard on a slip of glass the glass will often crack suddenly. Both\r\nthese instances recently occurred within the writer's experience,\r\nand few readers can have escaped noticing one or other of them. The\r\nbreakage in these instances is always caused because a strain is set\r\nup somewhere in the glass--there is more pressure at one point than\r\nanother, and the glass, unable to resist this unequal pressure, gives\r\nway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nThe Track of an Earth Wave\r\n\r\nShowing portion of a street in San Francisco after the terrible\r\nearthquake of 1906. The resemblance of the break in the ground to the\r\nappearance of a stationary wave should be noted.]\r\n\r\nWhat happens when it gives way? To answer this question we had better\r\ncarry our minds to the example of the pill-box lid. If the top of\r\nthe box were of very brittle material, like pottery or glass, then\r\nafter the breakage we know that most likely one of the broken pieces\r\nwould be a little higher than the other--would perhaps overlap it.\r\nThat is what we often see when examining the geological earth strata.\r\nOne stratum, instead of lying evenly with another where a crack\r\nhas occurred, rests a little above it or below it. This inequality\r\nor unevenness geologists call a fault. Now we can easily see that\r\nwhenever, and by whatever causes, a fault is produced, there is\r\nprobably at the same time an earthquake. The fault cannot be produced\r\nwithout a great and shaking disturbance. Mr. John Milne, the most\r\ndistinguished of British authorities on earthquakes, says that all\r\nlarge earthquakes originate from the formation or extension of these\r\n\"faults\" or great cracks in the strata.\r\n\r\nThe occurrences of these \"faults\" are most frequent when the process\r\nof mountain building has been going on over the earth. In other\r\nwords, if we imagine a period in which some great continental area\r\nof the world's surface was slowly rising above the oceans, then at\r\nthat time we should expect that there would have been great \"faults\"\r\noccurring in the strata, and great earthquakes following them. To\r\nquote his words: \"If therefore we wish to know when earthquakes\r\nwere greatest and most frequent, we must turn to those periods in\r\ngeological history when mountain ranges were built, when volcanic\r\nactivity was pronounced, and when great 'faults' were made. The first\r\nof these periods would be coincident with the creation of the Ural\r\nMountains, the Grampians, and other mountain ranges. This took place\r\nin the earliest geologic times. Another period of mountain formation\r\nwas when the Himalayas and the Alps were slowly but intermittently\r\nbrought into existence. In both these periods volcanic activity was\r\npronounced, and beds of coal were formed. When the crust of the earth\r\nwas crumbling, mountains grew spasmodically--(they sprang up, as it\r\nwere, from out of the giant forces which we have described earlier\r\nin this book)--'faults' gave rise to earthquakes, volcanic forces\r\nfound their vents, and conditions existed which gave rise to the\r\naccumulation of materials to form coal.\"\r\n\r\nBut, the reader will naturally inquire, if \"faults\" gave rise to\r\nearthquakes, and faults are the result of pressure, what produces the\r\npressure? And what produces the mountains? Before we answer that we\r\nmust again have recourse to examples taken from common experience.\r\nA sheet of glass or of marble we usually regard as a thing that may\r\nbreak but does not bend. But all of us have seen glass strips, if\r\nthey are long enough, bend under their own weight; and there are\r\neven marble mantelpieces which, if examined, show that the slab of\r\nmarble has _bent_. Thus we can readily imagine that sometimes the\r\nstrata of the earth will bend by reason of the weight put upon them.\r\nIf that weight is not put on them quite evenly the strata will be\r\nstill more likely to bend; it will go from bending to buckling,\r\nand from buckling to breaking. As soon as it breaks there will be\r\na \"fault\" formed. Those who recollect what we have said about the\r\nenormous weight of the rocks one above the other will not have to\r\nsearch far for the cause of weight sufficient to bend or buckle the\r\nrock strata of the earth. And those who have followed carefully all\r\nthat has been written about the shifting of materials from the land\r\nto the sea by the processes of denudation and erosion set up by rain\r\nand wind and carried out by streams and rivers, will easily discover\r\nwhere and how the shifting of great weights of the earth's surface\r\ngoes on. Little by little great weights are taken from one place\r\non the earth's surface to another, as we might shift the weights\r\nin balanced scale-pans grain by grain, till at last the heavier\r\nscale-pan goes down quickly, or it may be with a crash, and the\r\n\"fault\" occurs, while the earthquake follows.\r\n\r\nThere remains another question, however, to be answered, and it is,\r\nHow were the mountains formed? Mountains are very closely connected\r\nwith earthquakes, for nearly all the regions of the earth where\r\nthe great disturbances take place are in the neighbourhood of\r\ngreat mountain ranges; and many, indeed most, of the students of\r\nearthquakes believe this to be the case, because the great weight of\r\nthe mountains, especially when near the deep sea, induces pressure\r\non the rocks, and consequently slipping and \"faults.\" But the causes\r\nof mountain formation are very difficult to show with certainty.\r\nOne such explanation, that of the continual shifting of portions\r\nby weight of the earth, we have already given. There is another\r\none which may perhaps supply an additional cause. It is that just\r\nas \"faults\" produce earthquakes, perhaps in some cases earthquakes\r\nproduce \"faults.\" In the illustration we gave of the bottle-neck\r\nbeing broken by continual pressure, or the slide of a microscope\r\nsuddenly breaking with a crash, because the increasing pressure of\r\na screw was greater than it could bear, we have considered cases\r\nwhere the pressure was _slowly_ applied. But a tap with a hammer or\r\nany sudden shock would also produce a breakage--and \"faults,\" and\r\nan earthquake on a small scale--and it is possible that some of the\r\nconvulsions of nature and some of their permanent effects are caused\r\nby sudden and violent causes.\r\n\r\nOne such cause might be the violent and sudden formation of steam by\r\nthe contact of water with rock at a very high temperature. Everybody\r\nknows what happens to the kitchen boiler after a severe frost. The\r\nfrost clogs the pipes with ice, so that the kitchen boiler becomes\r\ndry because no water is reaching it; but it continues to grow hotter\r\nand hotter till the iron plates or iron lining become red-hot. Then\r\nthe frost perhaps gives way and a small amount of water finds its\r\nway into the red-hot boiler. The water is converted instantly into\r\nsteam; and, as a result, the boiler, if it is a weak one, is blown\r\nout into the kitchen, causing grave personal inconvenience to the\r\ncook. If the boiler is a strong one, it may merely crack. Now, apply\r\nthese considerations to the instance of the earth, its oceans, its\r\nthin crust, and its hot rocks situated at a depth of not more than\r\nthirty miles, and perhaps at a good deal less depth than that. What\r\nwould happen if the ocean leaked through into the strata of red-hot\r\nor molten rocks? There would be enormous quantities of steam formed;\r\nand if, owing to the vast pressure of strata and water above, these\r\nquantities of steam did not instantly produce violent explosions,\r\nyet underneath there would be imprisoned, peak, forces of tremendous\r\npower which would only await a favourable opportunity in order to\r\nmanifest themselves. The hot steam until this favourable opportunity\r\narose would be absorbed by the rocks, just as hot steel can be shown\r\nto absorb gases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nA Geyser at Rest in Yellowstone Park, U.S.A.\r\n\r\nThe encrusted deposits of mineral salts should be observed.]\r\n\r\nWe are thus face to face with the following situation, as it is\r\nexpressed by Dr. T. J. J. See, the American physicist:--The internal\r\ntemperature of the earth is extremely high with heated rocks quite\r\nnear the surface, while the crust is fractured and leaky everywhere,\r\nand especially where the depth of the sea is greatest. The sea\r\ncovers three-fourths of the earth's surface, and earthquakes are\r\nfound to be most violent where the sea is deepest, and volcanoes\r\nmost numerous on the adjacent shores. Can we then suppose that both\r\nearthquakes and volcanoes depend on the explosive power of steam\r\nwhich has developed in the heated rocks of the earth's crust? We\r\nhave said that earthquakes and volcanoes are most common in regions\r\nwhere high mountains are near deep oceans--as on the westward of\r\nSouth and Central America, the Aleutian Islands, the Kurile Islands,\r\nJapan, Sumatra, Java, and other islands of the East Indies bordering\r\non the deep waters of the Indian Ocean, New Zealand, and the Lesser\r\nAntilles in the West Indies, Iceland, Italy, and Greece. These are\r\nalso the regions where, owing to the existence of high mountains, the\r\nweight, the pressure, the tear and stress on the underlying strata\r\nare greatest, and where consequently there is the greater chance of\r\nstrata slipping or bending or giving way. Mr. John Milne divides the\r\nworld into eleven such great \"world-earthquake\" districts; and he\r\nhas endeavoured to show that all the great convulsions of the earth\r\nhave their origin in one or other of these areas--where usually a\r\ngreat mountain range slopes steeply down to the sea. There are eleven\r\nsuch world-earthquake districts. There is the Alaskan region, where\r\non the shore Mount Elias rises to a height of 18,000 feet and where\r\nthe water is 7000 feet deep sixty miles from the shore--altogether\r\na drop of 25,000 feet from the top of the mountain to the bed of\r\nthe ocean in 200 miles. This drop, without going into measurements,\r\nmay be taken as typical of the rest, which are classified as the\r\nCordillerean region, the Antillean region (in the earthquake district\r\nof which Mount Pelée at Martinique and the Soufrière in St. Vincent\r\nare situated); the Andean district; the Japan district; the Javan\r\ndistrict; the Mauritius district; the Antarctic district; three\r\nsubmarine districts of sunken ridges in the North-Eastern Atlantic,\r\nthe North-Western Atlantic, and the Northern Atlantic; and one great\r\nland district, distant from the sea, which lumps together all the\r\nmountains of the Alps, the Balkans, the Caucasus, and the Himalayas.\r\nIn thirteen years, from the time in which earthquake investigation\r\nhas become a science, 750 great earthquakes originated in these\r\ndistricts. On the average, about sixty great earthquakes occur\r\nevery year, or a little more than one a week. In addition to these\r\nworld-shaking effects there are about 30,000 small earthquakes every\r\nyear, England's annual contribution to this number being about half a\r\ndozen.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of a \"great earthquake,\" and how do we define\r\n\"small\" earthquakes? A small earthquake is one such as we have\r\ndescribed as taking place in the valley of the Mississippi, and\r\nwhich, even though it may produce considerable disturbance in its\r\nneighbourhood, is not perceptible at any great distance away. A great\r\nearthquake is one which sends its vibrations thousands of miles. A\r\nvery large earthquake, originating in any part of the world, _may\r\nbe recorded in any other part of the globe_. Although only a few\r\npeople in Great Britain have been privileged to feel a home-made\r\nearth tremor, every one of us is very many times a year moved by\r\nearthquakes. We do not perceive them because the back-and-forth\r\nmotion of the ground is performed too slowly, while if there is\r\na movement of the ground the undulations are so very flat that\r\nthey cannot be perceived. But at several places in England and at\r\nearthquake observatories (seismological stations) all over the\r\nworld, from Japan to Australia and from South Africa to Greenland,\r\ninstruments are set up which are sensitive enough to record these\r\ntremors, though not always to locate them. Sometimes when Professor\r\nBehar in Germany, or Mr. Milne from his observatory in the Isle of\r\nWight, telegraphs to the newspapers that signs of a great earthquake\r\nhave appeared on their instruments, the world hears no more of these\r\ndisturbances. They have occurred we are certain, but the place where\r\nthe great cataclysm which has thus shaken the whole round world took\r\nplace has been fortunately remote from inhabited portions of the\r\nearth, and has very likely been beneath the waters of some ocean.\r\n\r\nEarthquake waves start out from the great area where the cataclysm\r\ntook place, and begin to disturb the earth in all directions,\r\njust as if we were to put a row of marbles on a table and were to\r\nstrike the end marble of the row. The marble farthest from it would\r\npresently receive the shock as it travelled along the row of marbles.\r\nAny one of our readers who has ever seen a train of luggage wagons\r\nbeing shunted is familiar with the way in which the shock of a\r\nsudden pull or push on the part of the engine travels all down the\r\nline of wagons, and we may think of the shock of an earthquake as\r\ntravelling along and through the earth in the same way. Observation,\r\nhowever, shows that these waves are propagated farthest in one\r\nparticular direction. For example, the chief movement following\r\nthe San Francisco earthquake, which originated from fault lines\r\nrunning parallel to the coast of California, was much more marked in\r\ncountries lying to the east or west of California than in countries\r\nlying towards the south. England and Japan obtained large records of\r\nthe disturbance, while in Argentina the records were extremely small.\r\nIn the case of the Jamaica earthquake, where the lines of origin ran\r\neast and west, the phenomenon was reversed. Toronto received a large\r\nquantity of motion, and England a very little. Another peculiarity of\r\nthis phase of earthquake motion is that it may be propagated in one\r\ndirection round the world to a greater distance than in an opposite\r\ndirection. The suggestion is that the initial impulse was delivered\r\nin the direction towards which motion was propagated farthest. That\r\nwhich happens corresponds to what we see if we dip the blade of\r\na spade in water and suddenly push the blade in some particular\r\ndirection. The water waves thus created travel farthest in the\r\ndirection of the impulse.\r\n\r\nAnother curious phenomenon connected with the large waves of certain\r\nearthquakes is that they may be very marked for one thousand miles\r\nround their origin, and may be perceived on the exactly opposite\r\nside of the earth (though, of course, much reduced in size), but\r\ncannot be recorded on the earthquake instruments of the regions in\r\nbetween. For example, an earthquake originating near New Zealand may\r\nbe recorded in that country, but not in India, Egypt, West Asia, or\r\neast of Europe, though in Britain it may make itself evident on the\r\nseismometer's record. The phenomenon may be compared to a water wave\r\nrunning down an expanding estuary. At the mouth of such an estuary it\r\nmay have become so flat that it is no longer recognisable. Should it,\r\nhowever, run up a second estuary, we can imagine concentration taking\r\nplace, so that near the top of the second estuary it would eventually\r\nbecome recordable on instruments. In these antipodean survivors we\r\nsee the final efforts of a dying earthquake. It is only occasionally\r\nthat the precursors and the followers of these large waves have\r\nsufficient energy to reach their antipodes. They die _en route_.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times philosophers have held that the causes of\r\nearthquakes were associated with the contact between fire and water.\r\nPlato, Aristotle, Strabo, and Pliny all held that water and air\r\npenetrate into the earth through hollows, fissures, and crevices,\r\nthus developing in the heated interior great vapour, a part of\r\nwhich is expelled from volcanoes. Aristotle correctly associated\r\nseismic sea waves with earthquakes, and even Homer assigned these\r\ngreat disturbances of the sea to Poseidon's trident, which was also\r\nthe means employed for raising up islands from the sea bottom. The\r\nwithdrawal of the water from the shore after an earthquake and its\r\nreturn as a great wave were familiar to Aristotle, and are implied in\r\nhis description of the sinking of Helike in 373 B.C.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of earthquakes we may quote some passages\r\nfrom Mr. John Milne on the influence which these great disasters have\r\nexercised on the emotions. Immediately after the Kingston earthquake\r\nwe read of the dazed and almost insane condition of the people. Many\r\nwere affected with an outburst of religious ecstasy, thinking the\r\nlast day had come. The negro population camped on the racecourse\r\nand spent their time in singing hymns. Somewhat similar scenes took\r\nplace in Chili; men and women ran hither and thither, mad with terror\r\nand devoid of reason. Amid shrieks and sobs and the wailing of a\r\nmultitude an \"Ora pro nobis\" or a \"Pater noster\" might now and then\r\nbe heard. In early civilisations underground thunderings have so far\r\nexcited the imagination that subterranean monsters or personages\r\nhave been conjured into existence, and these in many instances have\r\nplayed a part in primitive religions. At the time of an earthquake in\r\nJapan the children are told that the shaking is due to the movement\r\nof a fish which is buried beneath their country, and in Japan we\r\nfind references to this fish in the pictorial art, pottery and\r\ncarving, literature, and everyday conversation, all of which would\r\nbe unintelligible if we did not know the story of the earthquake\r\nfish. In other countries the subterranean creature will be a pig, a\r\ntortoise, an elephant, or some other animal.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting myths, however, relate to underground\r\npersonages. The forty-five Grecian Titans, who were of gigantic\r\nstature and of proportionate strength, were confined in the bowels\r\nof the earth. According to the poets, the flames of Etna proceeded\r\nfrom the breath of Enceladus, and when he turned his weary body the\r\nwhole island of Sicily was shaken to its foundations. Neptune was\r\nnot only a god of the oceans, rivers, and fountains, but with a blow\r\nof his trident he could create earthquakes at pleasure. The worship\r\nof Neptune was established in almost every part of the Grecian\r\nworld. The Livians, in particular, venerated him, and looked upon\r\nhim as the first and greatest of the gods. The Palici were born in\r\nthe bowels of the earth, and were worshipped with great ceremonies\r\nby the Sicilians. In a superstitious age the altars of the Palici\r\nwere stained with the blood of human sacrifices. In Roman mythology\r\ntwo very familiar deities are Pluto and Vulcan. These and a host of\r\nother deities, the outcome of imagination, excited by displays of\r\nseismic and volcanic activity, we meet with every day in picture\r\ngalleries, in museums, in literature, and in our daily papers.\r\nEarthquakes have led to the abolition of oppressive taxation, the\r\nabolition of masquerades, the closing of theatres, and even to the\r\nalteration in fashions. A New England paper, of 1727, tells us that\r\n\"a considerable town in this province has been so far awakened by the\r\nawful providence in the earthquake that the women have generally laid\r\naside their hooped petticoats.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we shall consider more particularly the terrible\r\neffects of earthquakes on geological history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES AND MOUNTAIN FORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great prominence which we have given in the preceding pages\r\nto earthquakes is owing to the growing belief in the influence of\r\nearthquakes on the appearance and structure of those portions of the\r\nworld's crust which are known to us. There are two views which we\r\ncan take of earthquakes. One is to regard the larger number of them\r\nas being caused by slipping movements of the earth's crust. Looking\r\nat things in this way we should say that whenever there was a sudden\r\nbreak in the earth's strata, such as might occur (in accordance with\r\nan illustration given in a previous chapter) if all the level strata\r\nwere broken up like a crumpled page of type--then that an earthquake\r\nwould result. So that whenever we saw what geologists call a \"fault\"\r\nin strata we should know that an earthquake had occurred there. And\r\nwhy did it occur? Well, if we had a massive column of steel or of\r\ngranite five miles high, the steel or granite at the bottom of the\r\ncolumn would have to sustain such an enormous weight of material\r\nabove it that it would begin to spread. If we had a pyramid of the\r\nsame materials five miles high, the tendency to spread would not be\r\nso great, but still it would be there. Consequently, wherever there\r\nare high mountains there is a tendency of the earth strata beneath\r\nthem to spread, perhaps slowly, but inevitably; and if there is any\r\nweakness in the structure of the rocks near the base of the mountain,\r\nthen these will give way with a crash. A great \"fault\" will be\r\nproduced, and with it an earthquake.\r\n\r\nPeople living on the earth will only see the results of the\r\nearthquake on the ground just immediately below their feet; and there\r\nthese results are often very destructive to life and property; yet if\r\nthey were all that happened, we should expect them to be covered up\r\nin time, and the \"geological record\" of an earthquake would not be a\r\nvery important or even discernible thing a million years after it had\r\nhappened. But are these things, which the eye of man can perceive,\r\nthe only things that are happening during an earthquake? Is nothing\r\nhappening underneath the earth which will leave its mark thousands of\r\nyears after man has left the spot where the earthquake took place?\r\nMay it not be that the earthquake is the outcome of some mighty\r\nforce deep down in the earth; and may not this force cause both the\r\nearthquake and the geological \"fault\" which remains as the witness\r\nof its occurrence? If this be the case then the earthquake may be of\r\nenormous importance in geology.\r\n\r\nWe regard an earthquake, as we see it, as a destructive force.\r\nThat is because it destroys the works of man. But earthquakes are\r\ndoing constructive work as well; or, at any rate, they are usually\r\npresent when constructive work is being done. Destructive forces,\r\nsuch as erosion, are wearing down the structure of the globe, while\r\nearthquakes are the only known forces that are building it up. It\r\nis true that when an earthquake occurs rocks often fall, loose\r\nsediment is shaken down, and other settlements occur, but the real\r\nconstructive work consists in upheavals, little by little, as it may\r\nbe, of beaches, islands, coasts, plateaux, and perhaps larger areas.\r\nThese elevations are actually witnessed in certain earthquakes.\r\n\r\nMany islands in the sea have been raised from time to time within\r\neven living memory.\r\n\r\nThe south-western part of the island of Crete has been elevated\r\nwithin the historical period.\r\n\r\nThe region about Pozzuoli and the Bay of Naples has suffered both\r\nelevation and depression. There is the famous instance cited by\r\nSir Charles Lyell nearly eighty years ago of the Temple of Jupiter\r\nSerapis. This temple had many columns; and they are now situated\r\non dry land. The pillars are forty-two feet in height, and for\r\ntwelve feet upwards they are of smooth undisfigured marble. Then for\r\nanother twelve feet they are pitted with the holes made by a marine\r\nshell-fish called _Lithodomus_, the stone-dweller. What are we to\r\njudge from this? The temple was first built on dry land. Then the\r\nland sank taking the temple with it, and the columns were submerged\r\nin sea sediment to a depth of some thirty feet above their pedestals.\r\nThe lower portions of these pedestals were preserved intact, but\r\nthe marine shell-fish found a home in the upper part of the marble\r\ncolumns, and pierced them with the channels and grooves. After this\r\nhad gone on for a number of years the elevation of the land lifted\r\nthe temple and its columns clean out of the sea again, and the marine\r\nshell-fish could no longer live in the columns. But the traces of\r\ntheir habitation remain.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of this coast was actually witnessed at the time of the\r\neruption of Monte Nuovo in 1538. Moreover, the raising of the land\r\nwas perceived on a larger scale round the whole of the Bay of Naples\r\nduring the eruption of Vesuvius in April, 1706. Professor Lorenzo\r\nfound the elevation of the land at Pozzuoli to be six inches, and at\r\nPortici one foot.[14] The foundations of both Etna and Vesuvius were\r\nages ago laid in the sea.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The coast about Pozzuoli is now sinking again.]\r\n\r\nIn almost every part of the world there are raised beaches, such as\r\nwe have already mentioned in the neighbourhood of Valparaiso, on the\r\nChilian coast. The idea has been put forward by Dr. T. J. See that\r\nthe same cause which produces earthquakes produces these elevations\r\nof the land and produces also volcanoes. There are many circumstances\r\nwhich favour this idea. Let us consider what is happening at the\r\nbed of the sea. Some years ago, when certain officers of the United\r\nStates Navy were making ocean surveys, it was found that if hollow\r\nballs of thick glass were sunk to great depths in the ocean, they\r\ncame up more and more completely filled with water in proportion as\r\nthe depth increased, though no breakage or cracking of the glass had\r\noccurred, and no holes in it could be discovered even by the best\r\nmicroscopes. In other words, it became evident that the water had\r\nbeen slowly but bodily forced through the thick walls of the glass\r\n(under a pressure of less than 15,000 lb. to the square inch) in less\r\nthan an hour's time. Evidently, then, even such a substance as glass\r\nwill be penetrated by water if the pressure is great enough.\r\n\r\nTo make a practical application of these principles, what shall\r\nwe now say with respect to the ocean bottoms? In deep places the\r\npressure of the sea-water on them is very great, sufficient to force\r\nwater through glass. Obviously most of these bottoms will leak, and\r\nleak at a rapid rate under the enormous pressure operating in the\r\ngreatest depths of the sea. The bed of the ocean will not leak with\r\nequal rapidity in all places; but almost universal leakage will\r\ncertainly develop, and the water will be driven back into the earth\r\nat various rates. Where the rock is volcanic and badly fractured,\r\nor sandy, the leakage will be most rapid; and where the bed is made\r\nof clay or unbroken granite the leakage will be much more gradual.\r\nIt will also depend on the depth of the sea, and will be greatest\r\nwhere the ocean is deepest, and quite insignificant in shallow\r\nwater. A rapid rate of leakage would mean that large quantities of\r\nwater quickly come in contact with the heated rock, and develop\r\ncorrespondingly great steam pressure in the crust which underlies\r\nthat part of the ocean. One case in which we may suppose a rapid\r\nleakage to be taking place is in the case of volcanoes near the\r\nsea. In the case of lava pouring from a volcano, it is observed that\r\nthe molten rock emits vast quantities of vapour, of which, according\r\nto Sir Archibald Geikie, 999 parts in 1000 are steam. The enormous\r\nvolume of these has been brought home to us in recent years by the\r\nbehaviour of the volcano Mount Pelée, from which for several years\r\nafter the great eruption which devastated Port au Prince the vapours\r\nrose in clouds that were to be measured in cubic miles. Similar\r\nobservations about the quantities of vapour ejected by volcanoes have\r\nbeen made in Japan.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of Mount Pelée we may recall another phenomenon\r\nconnected with it, which also appears to bear out the supposition\r\nthat in the volcano's activity the action of steam takes a very\r\nlarge share. After its first outburst Mount Pelée continued to pour\r\nout lava and great quantities of vapour, as if like some gigantic\r\ncauldron it were being fed with fresh supplies of water; and there\r\nin the early March of the following year a most amazing thing took\r\nplace, under the very eyes of a celebrated investigator of volcanoes,\r\nnow dead, Professor Angelo Heilprin, who was remaining on the island.\r\nA great obelisk of andesite (a stone not unlike basalt) was forced\r\nup from the crater. It rose rapidly, as much as five feet a day; and\r\nit reached altogether a height of 840 feet above the crater's lip.\r\nIt was calculated to be about 300 feet in diameter at its base. It\r\ncontinued to push itself up for some months, sometimes sinking a\r\nlittle, sometimes rising like a colossal piston above a steam boiler.\r\nIts greatest height was 1100 feet above the height of Mount Pelée,\r\nand therefore at a height of 5143 feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The New Spine of Mont Pelée, showing Fissures and\r\nVertical Grooves\r\n\r\nPhotographed on March 15th, 1903. The spine was then 82 feet lower\r\nthan it became ten days later.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The New Spine of Mont Pelée, viewed from the Basin of\r\nthe Lac des Palmistes\r\n\r\nThe apex, 1174 feet above the rim directly in front; the remains of\r\nMorne la Croix on the edge of the crater at the right.]\r\n\r\nA violent eruption would reduce its mass and its steeple-like\r\npinnacle; but after its losses it generally pushed up again.\r\nProfessor Heilprin at last got near enough to observe it, and the\r\nobelisk was found to be not of pumice stone, as had at first been\r\nsuspected, but of the hard rock we have mentioned. It had, in fact,\r\nbeen comparable to a Titanic cork of rock which had closed up some\r\nvent far down in the crust of the earth, and which had at last been\r\nlifted by the steam pressure beneath it. It finally sank back into\r\nthe crater, but it was replaced by a dome of rock which underwent\r\nsimilar changes in height, though on a smaller scale, to those of\r\nthe obelisk. The dome of rock was, however, on a more massive scale\r\neven than the obelisk, and at one period of its career a spine, 100\r\nfeet in height, like a smaller obelisk, was pushed up through its\r\nmiddle. This dome was examined by the explorers, the Abbé Yvon and M.\r\nBeaufroy, who found that the dome was a great mass of andesite, while\r\nabout it were fragments of the rock of which the obelisk had been\r\ncomposed. They wrote at the time:--\r\n\r\n\"It is an error to suppose that there exists in the bottom of Mount\r\nPelée a hole from which lava and gases have come out. At present\r\nthere is a tremendous cork of andesite, which is called the 'Dome,'\r\nand which must have as its dimensions a diameter half a mile across\r\nat its base and a height of about 1200 feet. On all sides of the dome\r\nthere are fumaroles (small cone-like craters), some of which throw\r\nout a reddish smoke, others of which discharge white smoke, and\r\nothers are still surrounded with a carpet of sulphur several yards in\r\ndepth.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the great eruption of Mount Pelée in 1902 it was found by\r\nmeasurement that a considerable portion of the adjacent sea bottom\r\nhad sunk down many fathoms. It is impossible to believe that this\r\nsinking had been caused by the mere shaking of the earthquakes\r\naccompanying that eruption. We must, therefore, suppose that after\r\nthe dreadful explosions which destroyed St. Pierre and devastated\r\nMartinique a subsidence near the roots of the mountain (which is just\r\nby the sea) took place. What we should judge to have happened is that\r\nby some means an explosion took place below the sea bottom; that\r\nparts of the molten rock, moved by the forces of the explosion, were\r\nmoved towards the mountain (Mount Pelée), which thereupon broke into\r\neruption, acting as an outlet for the imprisoned rocks. When these\r\nmolten rocks were thus removed a great cavity was formed in the bed\r\nof the sea, which accordingly caved in.\r\n\r\nA similar explanation would account for the raising of the Chilian\r\ncoast-line after the great earthquakes of 1835, of which we have\r\nalready spoken. The coast and, indeed, the whole country back to\r\nthe Andes was slightly raised. This could only be explained by the\r\npushing in or forcing in of a corresponding bulk of lava under the\r\nland; and this lava could come from nowhere except from under the\r\nbed of the great trough in the adjacent sea. After an explosion\r\n(which is caused by the sea penetrating through to the molten rocks)\r\nthe trough, where the \"accident\" first took place, would naturally\r\ndeepen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Stereo Copyright, Underwood & U._      _London and New York_\r\n\r\nThe Dead City of St. Pierre, Martinique\r\n\r\nThe town of St. Pierre was perhaps the most beautiful in the West\r\nIndies. The volcano of Mont Pelée, which is seen in the background,\r\nand which is five miles away, suddenly belched out deadly gases,\r\ndust, steam, and boiling mud, which overwhelmed the town and\r\ncompletely destroyed it. The houses were reduced to ruins, and the\r\npeople were killed by the wave of hot gases sweeping down from the\r\nvolcano.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, if we suppose that after a time the water again penetrates,\r\nand again comes into contact with rocks that have again become heated\r\nup, there will be another explosion, and yet others. Each of these\r\nexplosions will push along the ejected streams of lava, step by step,\r\ntill they reach the land, and even till they reach the mountains\r\nbordering the sea. The forces thus arising would cause upheavals,\r\neven if they did not cause earthquakes. Such forces might bend\r\nstrata, contort the rocks, and cause \"faults.\"\r\n\r\nBut why, the reader may ask, do you suppose that all these explosions\r\nof lava are directed to the land? We do not suppose that they are.\r\nThe lava may be forced away from the land. Then if that occurs a\r\nridge may be upheaved, or possibly a submarine volcano.\r\n\r\n\"At the Hawaii Islands on 25th February, 1877,\" writes Sir Archibald\r\nGeikie, \"masses of pumice during a submarine volcanic explosion were\r\nejected to the surface, one of which struck the bottom of the boat\r\nwith considerable violence and then floated. At the same time, when\r\nwe reflect to what a considerable extent the bottom of the great\r\nocean basin is dotted over with volcanic cones, rising often solitary\r\nfrom profound depths, we can understand how large a proportion of\r\nthe actual eruptions may take place under the sea. The foundations\r\nof these volcanic islands doubtless consist of submarine lavas and\r\nfragmentary materials, which in each case continue to accumulate to\r\na height of two or three miles, till the pile reaches the surface\r\nof the water and appears above it. The immense abundance and wide\r\ndiffusion of volcanic ash, pumice, etc., over the bottom of the\r\nPacific and Atlantic oceans, even at distances remote from land, as\r\nhas been made known by the voyage of the _Challenger_, may indicate\r\nthe prevalence and persistence of submarine volcanic action.\"\r\n\r\nIt is fairly clear, therefore, that the sea bottom is leaky, and that\r\nvolcanoes which are a consequence of it are scattered freely over\r\nthe deep ocean floor. In some places, of course, very few eruptions\r\noccur, either because the underlying rocks are less leaky or the sea\r\nis too shallow for pressure.\r\n\r\nWe have pictured the water of the oceans thus sinking down into the\r\nhot rocks. It will not always cause an explosion at once. The steam\r\nmay not immediately become free, but will become absorbed in the\r\nhot rocks till the lava grows so fully saturated by the hot vapour\r\nthat it swells and requires more space. When the tension becomes\r\ngreat enough the crust begins to shake and the paroxysm continues\r\ntill the steam-saturated lava moves along the nearest break or\r\n\"fault\" or vent. When the underlying molten rock has thus obtained\r\nmore space the agitation ceases till the tension again becomes too\r\npowerful for the crust to withstand, when another readjustment takes\r\nplace. A familiar illustration of this process is seen in the lid\r\nof a tea-kettle when the steam pressure accumulates till it sets\r\nthe lid quivering. As the steam escapes at the sides the agitation\r\nslowly dies down and the lid then remains quiet till the accumulating\r\npressure again requires relief, when the shaking is renewed. Thus the\r\nprocess is periodic, and the period depends on the rapidity with\r\nwhich the steam is developed. In the case of earthquakes, as already\r\nremarked, the steam is not free, but absorbed in the molten rock,\r\nand when the agitation begins this gives a similar quivering motion\r\nto the block of the earth's crust overlying it, and ceases only when\r\nreadjustment occurs--usually by the neighbouring \"fault\" slipping in\r\nsome way so as to give more space to the swelling lava beneath. Of\r\ncourse, many of the cracks caused by this swelling are never seen;\r\nand the molten lava seldom reaches the surface except when through\r\nvolcano vents or cracks in mountains that are near the sea-shore; but\r\nsuch outbreaks are probably more common in the deep sea.\r\n\r\nTo see how effective the pressure arising from the depths of the\r\nocean may be in driving water into the crust of the earth, we may\r\nobserve that the tendency to penetrate is everywhere proportional to\r\nthe depth of the sea. Now everybody knows that if a cistern be placed\r\nat the top of a house and connected with a fountain in the garden the\r\nfountain ought to throw a jet as high as the cistern because water,\r\nas the saying goes, always rises to its own level. As a matter of\r\npractice the water does not rise so high because of the resistance of\r\nthe air. But for theoretical purposes we may consider the proportion\r\ntrue, and we might similarly say that the pressure in a sea one\r\nmile deep would thus throw a stream a mile high; in a sea two miles\r\ndeep, two miles high; and so on. Now some of the ocean depths exceed\r\nfive miles, the greatest, near Guam, being 5269 fathoms, almost\r\nexactly six miles. Is it therefore any wonder that the deeps east\r\nof Japan, near the Aleutian Island, west of South America, near\r\nGuam, between Samoa and New Zealand, give rise to enormous leakage of\r\nthe sea bottom, and consequently many world-shaking earthquakes? A\r\ncomparatively feeble pressure of water, such as hydraulic engineers\r\nuse in mining, rapidly cuts away hills and washes out all their gold;\r\nin the same way the waters of Niagara, falling through only 160 feet,\r\nslowly wear away the solid rock over which they pour. What, then, may\r\nbe expected of a constant water pressure which will throw a jet five\r\nmiles high? Such is the pressure all over the bed of the Tuscarora\r\nDeep, and it continues from year to year, century to century. It is\r\nthis pressure which forces the water so rapidly into the earth, and\r\ngives rise to all the great earthquakes and sea-waves with which\r\nJapan is afflicted. No stone on earth, however thick its layers,\r\ncould withstand such a pressure; nay, under it the water would go\r\nthrough the hardest metals, and sink down deeper and deeper into the\r\nbowels of the earth. Thus subterranean steam would arise beneath the\r\ncrust and accumulate till relief was afforded by a shaking of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThus we see how immensely important the same causes that give rise\r\nto earthquakes may be in moulding the outlines and contours of the\r\nrocks and the \"everlasting hills.\" In the present state of geological\r\nknowledge we cannot say that these steam explosions are the sole\r\ncauses of mountain building, but it is evident that they must play\r\na great part in them. The action of the submarine explosions may\r\nbe compared to a man digging out a trench. As he digs along the\r\ntrench, the earth that he excavates he throws on to either side of\r\nthe trench, so that a ridge appears on each side of the excavation.\r\nThe result is the same in the case of the continuous lava explosions\r\nin deep seas, especially in those deep seas like the waters off the\r\nwest coast of South America, where a great range of mountains runs\r\nparallel to an ocean that is of great depth only a short distance\r\nfrom the land. A trough or trench is cut downwards by successive\r\nexplosions and expulsions of lava. As the trough is arched downwards\r\nlike a broad letter =U=, the steam pressure from beneath cannot\r\neasily force it upwards. What will therefore happen? Imagine what\r\nwould happen in a steam saucepan or kettle if the vapour could\r\nnot get out at the top or lid. It would tend to blow out at the\r\nsides. Or if you think of a slab of dough rising under the effect\r\nof yeast. Suppose the baker presses a flat board on the top of the\r\nrising dough, and presses down on it so that it cannot force its way\r\nupwards. It will then naturally spread out to the sides. Similarly\r\nthe rising yeasty lava under the curved ocean bed has to force its\r\nway sideways under the crust. It forces its way partly towards the\r\nland--where the mountains run along the coast as in the case of the\r\nAndes--or farther out underneath the ocean. Generally the movement\r\nof the lava will be towards the mountains till the trough gets broad\r\nand deep and the mountains very far away, and so high that their\r\nweight offers unexpectedly great resistance to the underground stream\r\nof lava. Then the release will at length become easier towards the\r\nocean by the forcing up of ridges or volcanoes along the other margin\r\nof the trough. Ridges with peaks in them will usually result, and\r\nthis is the beginning of a new range of mountains in the sea, which\r\nare destined to rise slowly from it parallel to the great range\r\nof mountains on the shore. There may thus be two parallel ridges,\r\nperhaps hundreds of miles apart, with a valley between them. This\r\nvalley may be drained in the course of ages, or filled in by the\r\nprocesses of erosion which we have described in the earliest chapters\r\nof this volume.\r\n\r\nIt will be of interest to quote at this point what Pliny nearly two\r\nthousand years ago said in his _Natural History_ (Book II) on islands\r\nwhich have been uplifted from the Mediterranean, evidently as the\r\nresult of volcanic causes:--\r\n\r\n\"Land is sometimes formed in a different manner, rising suddenly out\r\nof the sea, as if nature was compensating the earth for its losses,\r\nrestoring in one place what she had swallowed up in another. Delos\r\nand Rhodes, islands which have now been long famous, are recorded\r\nto have risen up in this way. More lately there have been some\r\nsmaller islands formed: Anapha, which is beyond Melos; Nea, between\r\nLemnos and the Hellespont; Halone, between Lebedos and Teos; Thera\r\nand Therasia, among the Cyclades, in the fourth year of the 135th\r\nOlympiad. And among the same islands, 130 years afterwards, Hiera,\r\nalso called Automate, made its appearance; also Thia, at the distance\r\nof two stadia from the former, 110 years afterwards, in our own\r\ntimes, when M. Junius Silanus and L. Balbus were consuls, on the 8th\r\nof the Ides of July.\r\n\r\n\"Opposite to us, and near to Italy, among the Æolian Isles, an island\r\nemerged from the sea; and likewise one near Crete, 2500 paces in\r\nextent, and with warm springs in it; another made its appearance in\r\nthe third year of the 163rd Olympiad, in the Tuscan Gulf, burning\r\nwith a violent explosion. There is a tradition, too, that a great\r\nnumber of fishes were floating about the spot, and that those who\r\nemployed them for food immediately expired. It is said that the\r\nPithecusan Isles rose up in the same way in the Bay of Campania, and\r\nthat shortly afterwards the mountain Epopos, from which flame had\r\nsuddenly burst forth, was reduced to the level of the neighbouring\r\nplain. In the same island it is said that a town was sunk in the sea;\r\nthat, in consequence of another shock, a lake burst out, and that,\r\nby a third, Prochytas was formed into an island, the neighbouring\r\nmountains being rolled away from it.\"\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, other causes which warp and bend strata. We have\r\ncompared the earth to the core of a tightly wound golf ball--always\r\nin a state of strain. The strain at great depths below the surface\r\nmight amount to several tons to the square inch, and it can easily\r\nbe understood that breaks might occur in consequence, especially if\r\nsome slight additional shock set the rocks into vibration. In the\r\ndeep copper mines of the northern peninsula of Michigan the behaviour\r\nof the whole earth, with respect to earthquakes and stresses due\r\nto other causes, is well illustrated on a small scale. At certain\r\ntimes during each day blasts are set off in the solid rock at\r\nvarious places in each mine. Each battery of blasts is a miniature\r\nearthquake. In that particular spot, the earthquake centre, the rock\r\nis fractured within a space limited by a radius of a few feet. Within\r\na large space, limited by a radius of a few hundred feet, elastic\r\nvibrations are set up in the solid rock which are sufficiently\r\nviolent to be perceptible to the touch and to the hearing. Within\r\nthis larger space no fracture of the rock occurs. Feebler vibrations\r\ndoubtless extend out for miles from the point of fracture, just as\r\nvibrations extend over the whole earth from an earthquake centre.\r\nNow it also happens that in the lower levels of these deep mines,\r\nat a mile below the surface of the earth, the solid rock is slowly\r\nyielding, in a non-elastic manner, under the influence of the great\r\nweight above it, so that the larger openings are gradually closing\r\nup. This is so clearly recognised and progresses so rapidly that\r\nit is proposed as routine practice, at the deep levels in these\r\nmines, to take out the ore at the distant end of each drift first.\r\nThe miners will then work back slowly toward the shaft from which\r\nthe drift is entered, while the spaces in which they have recently\r\nlaboured gradually close up behind them. The gradual collapse known\r\nto be in progress occurs apparently by imperceptible flow and by\r\nminor fracturing, but not, as a rule, by catastrophes which close up\r\nany opening suddenly. In this respect it is an epitome of what is\r\ntaking place every year in the failing earth as it yields under such\r\nstresses.\r\n\r\nThere may be local tremors due to causes which are less immense and\r\nworld-wide. One such cause might be the collapse of cavities in the\r\nearth. We are well acquainted with some such caves near the surface\r\nof the earth. These caves, especially in limestone, are commonly\r\ncaused by the action of springs. Even pure water will dissolve a\r\nminute quantity of the substance of many rocks, and rain water is far\r\nfrom being chemically pure water. It takes oxygen and carbonic acid\r\nout of the air as it falls, and it abstracts acids out of the soil\r\nthrough which it sinks. The presence of this acid gives the water a\r\ngreatly increased power of attacking carbonate of lime. Now limestone\r\nis a rock almost entirely composed of carbonate of lime. It occurs\r\nin most parts of the world, covering sometimes tracts of hundreds\r\nor thousands of square miles, and often rising into groups of hills\r\nand ranges of mountains. The abundance of this rock offers ample\r\nopportunity for the display of the dissolving action of subterranean\r\nwater. The water trickles down the vertical fissures along the planes\r\nbelow the limestone beds. As it flows on it dissolves and removes the\r\nstone till in the course of centuries these passages are gradually\r\nenlarged into clefts, tunnels, and caverns. The ground becomes\r\nhoneycombed with dark subterranean chambers, and running streams fall\r\ninto these chambers and continue their course underground.\r\n\r\nIn England there are famous \"pot-hole\" caverns in Yorkshire and the\r\nwest of England. The Peak Cavern in Derbyshire is believed to be\r\n1200 feet long, and in some places 120 feet high. The caverns of\r\nAdelsberg near Trieste have been explored to a distance of several\r\nmiles. The River Poik has broken into one part of the labyrinth of\r\nchambers through which it rushes before emerging again to the light.\r\n\"Narrow tunnels,\" says Sir Archibald Geikie, \"expand into spacious\r\nhalls, beyond which egress is again afforded by low passages into\r\nother lofty recesses. The most stupendous chamber measures 669 feet\r\nin length, 630 feet in breadth, and 111 feet in height. From the roof\r\nhang white stalactites which uniting with the floor form pillars\r\nshowing endless varieties of form and size.\" Still more gigantic is\r\nthe system of subterranean passages in the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky,\r\nthe accessible parts of which are believed to have a combined length\r\nof about 150 miles. The caverns of Luray, in Virginia, are scarcely\r\nless wonderful; and in their case American ingenuity has hit on the\r\nidea of sucking the pure, dustless air out of these caverns in order\r\nto ventilate a sanatorium. Indeed, a book might easily be written\r\non the wonders of the limestone caverns of the world, but our only\r\npurpose in mentioning them in this chapter is to indicate how the\r\nrocks of the earth may be made unstable, so that a slight shock may\r\nprecipitate a catastrophe in them--a kind of subterranean landslip\r\nwhich in its turn may give rise to some of the symptoms of earth\r\ntremors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Yorkshire Pot-Hole: showing the Effects which can be\r\nProduced in Limestone by Underground Water\r\n\r\nThe immense depth may be better realised by comparing the pot-hole\r\nwith the Nelson Monument, which is 162 feet in height.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nFAMILIES OF ROCKS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far, in accordance with the principles of the great geologists\r\nfrom Sir Charles Lyell onwards, we have tried to disclose the\r\nhistory of the earth's crust by observing the processes which are\r\ngoing on to-day under our eyes. That is not, however, the only way\r\nin which history has to be written. The documents on which history\r\nrests are often lamentably incomplete. The records have great\r\ngaps in them, and very often the gaps have to be filled by that\r\nexercise of the imagination which Bishop Creighton once described\r\nas the rearrangement of facts. We shall later in this book show\r\nhow naturalists can reconstruct the skeleton and even the general\r\nappearance of an animal which for ages has not been seen alive on\r\nthe earth, from a consideration of fragments of the bony structure.\r\nSimilarly the archæologists who inquire into the history of forgotten\r\npeoples can picture to us their lives and habits and manners from a\r\nconsideration of the fragmentary weapons and pottery and architecture\r\nwhich they left in their buried cities; and similarly the geologist,\r\nknowing, or partly knowing, how the forces of nature are at work\r\nto-day, can attempt to describe the conditions under which rocks were\r\nlaid down before man ever trod them.\r\n\r\nIn speaking or writing of the earliest stages of the world's history\r\nwe have to adopt what seems to be the most likely history, modestly\r\nqualifying what we say by adding that these speculations are only\r\nthe fruits of an inquiry that man has pushed beyond the ascertained\r\nfacts. But we are on firmer footing when we come to deal with that\r\nportion of the globe which we can examine. The crust of the earth\r\nhas been found to consist of successive layers of rock which, though\r\nfar from constant in their occurrence, and though often broken and\r\ncrumpled by subsequent disturbances, have been recognised over a\r\nlarge portion of the globe. They are the earth's own chronicle of its\r\nhistory. Had these rocks of the Geological Record remained in their\r\noriginal positions we should have known little of them, because only\r\nthe most recent would have been visible. Owing, however, to the way\r\nin which the earth's crust has been twisted and cracked and broken,\r\nportions of the bottom layers have been pushed up to the surface,\r\nand the lower rocks have been inclined so that we can examine their\r\nupturned edges. Instead, therefore, of being restricted to examining\r\na few hundred feet of earth crust we can examine many thousand\r\nfeet. The total thickness of the rocks of Europe which contain\r\nfossil remains has been estimated at 75,000 feet, or fourteen miles.\r\nThis vast depth of rock has been laid open to our observation by\r\ndisturbances, twists, contortions, upsettings of the crust.\r\n\r\nWe shall not press on the reader in a volume of this kind any\r\ndetailed classification of the strata, but he will like to know the\r\nnames of the five great periods into which geologic time is divided.\r\n\r\nThe first period was the Archæan, embracing the periods of the\r\nearliest rocks wherein few or no traces of life occur.\r\n\r\nThe second period was the Palæozoic (ancient life) or Primary, which\r\nincludes the long succession of ages during which the earliest types\r\nof life existed.\r\n\r\nThe third period was the Mesozoic (middle life), comprising a series\r\nof ages when more advanced types of life flourished.\r\n\r\nThe fourth period was the Cainozoic (recent life) or Tertiary period,\r\nwhen such types of life as we know and see now appeared. This period,\r\nhowever, does not include man.\r\n\r\nThe fifth period is the Quaternary or Post-Tertiary and Recent, and\r\nincludes the time since man appeared on the earth.\r\n\r\nThese divisions were not of the same length. The Palæozoic ages were\r\nprobably far, far longer than those of any other division, while\r\nthe Quaternary period is shorter than any of those which preceded\r\nit. Each of these main divisions is divided further into systems or\r\nshorter periods (just as the dynasties of ancient Egypt could be\r\nsubdivided into reigns). Though the broad outlines of the sequence\r\nof the living things which existed in those periods has been the\r\nsame all over the world, many local differences may be traced in the\r\nnature and grouping of the sedimentary materials in which the remains\r\nof the living things of these epochs have been preserved.\r\n\r\nTo find the oldest rocks, we must seek those which lie at the bottom\r\nor underneath all the others. Judged by this test, the oldest\r\nrocks in Great Britain are certain hard rocks (like gneiss, or the\r\nmaterial of which volcanic veins are composed) which crop out in the\r\nnorth-west of Scotland, and which form the outer Hebrides. They are\r\nalso known in Anglesea, and in the extreme west of Wales, at St.\r\nDavid's. Similar strata form the Malvern Hills of Worcestershire,\r\nthe Longmynd Hills, Caer Caradoc and the Wrekin Hills of Shropshire,\r\nand the hilly district of Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire. For a\r\nlong time the Cambrian rocks of Wales, so called from North Wales's\r\nancient name of Cambria, were believed to be the oldest on the face\r\nof the earth. Up to the year 1830 even these rocks had no name or\r\nrecognition, for geologists believed that it was impossible to\r\nclassify them. But in 1831 Professor Adam Sedgwick, of Cambridge,\r\nbegan the diligent study of the rocks in North Wales, and after five\r\nyears' work he was able to announce in 1836 that he had determined\r\nthe general order of succession in that district of a certain ancient\r\ngroup of slaty, gritty, and flaggy strata. However, eighteen years\r\nlater, in 1854, Sir William Logan, who was then engaged in mapping\r\nthe rocks of Canada, found along the River St. Lawrence an enormous\r\nthickness (30,000 feet or more) of gneiss, quartzite, schist,[15]\r\nlimestone, etc., these rocks underlying--and being, therefore, older\r\nthan--the Cambrian strata, which are also well developed in that\r\ncountry. To these \"bottom\" rocks Logan gave the name of Laurentian.\r\nFor some time afterwards the same name was also applied to the\r\nsomewhat similar rocks which were found to underlie the Cambrian\r\nformation in Britain, but it was felt safer to give the English\r\nrocks a more general name. They are therefore now usually called\r\nPre-Cambrian, which simply means older than the Cambrian strata, or\r\nArchæan.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Hard rocks are sometimes composed of different\r\nminerals, which are arranged in a way that reminds us of a bed\r\nof fallen leaves, and are called \"foliated,\" from the Latin word\r\n_folium_, a leaf. Gneiss is a good example of a foliated rock. It is\r\ncomposed of the three minerals, quartz, felspar, and mica, arranged\r\nin this foliated manner. Mica schist, talc schist, and other rocks\r\nhave a similar structure, and are sometimes briefly called \"schists.\"]\r\n\r\nIn Canada the total thickness of the Laurentian, Pre-Cambrian,\r\nor Archæan rocks is now estimated at 50,000 feet. In Britain it\r\nis nothing like so great as this (though still considerable);\r\nbut the thickness of these extremely old and altered rocks is a\r\nvery difficult matter to determine, for all signs of the original\r\nstratification in them have often been destroyed, and the rocks have\r\nbeen so bent and folded that it is possible the same beds may have\r\nbeen measured more than once in the same section.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood from some of the foregoing sentences that the\r\ntask of dating or classifying these early rocks is one which is far\r\nfrom simple, and which has given rise to many different opinions. We\r\nmay here give another example. \"During the years between 1831 and\r\nwhile Sedgwick was occupied in studying the rocks of North Wales,\"\r\nwrites Mr. W. Jerome Harrison, \"another geologist, Mr. (afterwards\r\nSir) Roderick Murchison, was engaged in the examination of the\r\nstrata which occupy the south-east of Wales and the adjoining border\r\ncounties of England. To these rocks Murchison gave, in 1835, the\r\nname of Silurian, from the ancient British tribe of the Silures, who\r\ninhabited that part of the country when the Romans invaded Britain.\"\r\nLater in last century, in order to distinguish more clearly the\r\nperiods of the rocks which began or ended in these areas, the name\r\nof another ancient British tribe was called into requisition--the\r\nOrdovics; and thus for certain strata which were neither Silurian nor\r\nCambrian Professor Lapworth proposed the name Ordovician.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, now leave these geological controversies,\r\nenthralling as they are to those who have taken part in them, to\r\nconsider briefly what was the aspect of the earth during the ages\r\nwhen these rocks were being laid down. The earliest rocks do not\r\ngenerally contain fossils, though there is no doubt that life existed\r\nduring the later part of the time when they were laid down. The\r\nfew fossils that have been preserved are those of crustacea (the\r\nspecies from which shrimps, for example, are derived), and there are\r\ncertain tracks of two kinds of burrowing worms. It is noticeable\r\nthat crustacea, the oldest definite fossils yet found, belong to a\r\nfamily which is well up in the animal kingdom, and therefore we know\r\nthat lower forms of life must have been long in existence. Since we\r\ncan only draw conclusions of the climate of a period from its fossil\r\nremains, and as these fossil remains are so scarce, we cannot say\r\nreally anything of value about the world's climate in the earliest\r\neras.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the Cambrian, however, we are on firmer ground. In\r\nthe Cambrian rocks there is, for the first time, a fair preservation\r\nin fossil form of the life of the period. Even here the record is far\r\nfrom complete, but it is an immeasurable advance on the records of\r\nprevious periods. The most striking thing about this comparatively\r\nplentiful appearance of life is that while the animal kingdom is\r\nfairly well represented the plant remains are hardly to be recognised\r\nat all. Yet there must have been plants if only to feed the animals,\r\nand we have very good reasons for believing that the surface of the\r\nland was clothed with some form of vegetation. Not a few of the\r\nCambrian animals were fixed to the bottom of the sea, and therefore\r\nthere must have been enough matter of some organic kind floating\r\nin the water to bring them their daily food. Possibly many of the\r\nplants were of the minute kind which forms scum on rivers and ponds,\r\nand so would not readily leave fossil impressions. Turning to the\r\nrecord of animal life, it appears that nearly every division of\r\nthe animal kingdom, except such as had backbones, had some kind of\r\na representative in Cambrian times. Crustaceans, molluscs, worms,\r\ncorals, jelly fish, sponges, quite a large variety of sea-animals,\r\nsuddenly make their appearance, and although no traces of land\r\nanimals have yet been found, we have reason to believe that some land\r\nanimals may have existed. Our reason is that in the next era but one\r\n(Silurian) scorpions and insects appear, and these are such highly\r\ndeveloped forms of land-life that they probably had some primitive\r\nancestors in the Cambrian. No real fish have been found in the\r\nCambrian rocks, but they appeared in the next era (Ordovician). It\r\nis the trilobite which is the characteristic animal of the Cambrian\r\ntimes. They were crustaceans; they had eyes; and they gave the\r\npromise of development; but there is no reason for believing that\r\nthey were as high in the order of creation as the commonest lobster\r\nof the sea-shore. Nothing remains to us of them except their bony\r\nstructure, but we believe that they could both swim and walk on the\r\nsea-bottom; that some were swift of movement, and that they acquired\r\nthe habit of moulting their shell. They may have been sociable\r\nanimals, for the shells of trilobites are sometimes found together\r\nin large numbers, occasionally closely packed, \"spoon fashion,\" and\r\nthough these may be moulted shells, we are warranted in supposing\r\nthat the early trilobites lived in colonies, hunted for food, and\r\nmade war like their descendants millions of years after. What were\r\nthe actual conditions of life in this world of Cambrian days we\r\ndo not know positively. The first beginnings of life, the simple\r\none-celled plants, may have first dwelt in the deep ocean. The land\r\nwas barren, its lakes unfitted to support life. On the other hand, it\r\nis equally likely that the first beginnings of life may have been the\r\nsimple plants growing in inland waters and gradually spreading down\r\nto the sea. We do not know, but it is most probable that life began\r\nin some great body of water, where plants and insignificant animals\r\ngrew together, perhaps fought together, and certainly in this\r\nenvironment became more and more fitted for the business of living.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Henry R. Knipe's scholarly and well-informed volume, _Nebula\r\nto Man_ (J. M. Dent & Co.), to which we are indebted not only\r\nfor several of our illustrations but for many extremely valuable\r\nsuggestions, the struggle for existence in the early ocean is well\r\nsummed up:--\r\n\r\n    Thus through the brine life manifold proceeds,\r\n    Impelled to higher states by growing needs;\r\n    And all these early life-types in the seas\r\n    Will branch in time to many species;\r\n    And some amid conditions too severe,\r\n    Must, after stress and struggle, disappear.\r\n    And when a species falls from Life's domain\r\n    It never gains a place on Earth again.\r\n\r\nWe may speculate with some approach to certainty on the general\r\nappearance of the earth in those days. There was far more water\r\non the surface of the globe; the land surfaces were small and\r\ninfrequent. The seas may have been shallower than those which we\r\nknow, but they were far greater in extent. There must have been far\r\nmore rain and a very much greater number of violent storms arising\r\nfrom the constant condensation of the waters by the rays of the sun.\r\nThe sun was probably seen far less often in those days, and there\r\nare some geologists who believe the earth to have been perpetually\r\ncovered with cloud, as the planet Venus is now.\r\n\r\nEurope as a continent did not exist. A few islands showed their heads\r\nabove the waves where Germany and Switzerland, Eastern France and\r\nSpain now stand. Scotland's rocky islets were probably visible, on\r\nthe extreme west, though these islands were destined to sink again\r\nbelow the waves. Thence the ocean stretched without a break, as at\r\npresent, to Canada. A great part of Canada's bleak lands was above\r\nthe waters; but the United States, except for a few great islands,\r\nwere submerged. In the southern hemisphere South America, split into\r\nnumerous long reefs and islands, gave promise of the continent to\r\nbe; and there were great stretches of land over Brazil, extending\r\nto the west where the great chains of mountains now rise. Asia was\r\nlargely covered with shallow waters, and the whole extent of the\r\nnorthern plains of Africa was sea. So far as we are able to judge\r\nthe distinctions of climates were less marked then than now, and\r\nthe conditions seem to have been much more uniform over all the\r\nnorthern hemisphere. This equality of climate lasted into the next or\r\nOrdovician period.\r\n\r\nThe Ordovician period glides insensibly into the Cambrian. There was\r\nno distinct break in the succession of life. The species seem to have\r\nslowly extended and developed from one of these great periods into\r\nanother. But the life of the Ordovician era, which has been preserved\r\nfor us, is much more abundant. Land was beginning to emerge from\r\nthe sea in greater bulk; life was springing up on the land and was\r\nemerging from the sea, perhaps to take up its habitation there. The\r\nfirst insect life appears in the Ordovician. It is not an imposing\r\nrelic except when seen through the eye of imagination. It is just an\r\nobscure wing of an insect which was found impressed on some shales\r\nfound in the upper Ordovician rocks of Sweden, and all we can say of\r\nit is that it belonged to the same class of insects as lady-birds.\r\nThe existence of this insect shows that there must have been land\r\nvegetation and an atmosphere which was suited to active air-breathing\r\nthings. The other appearance of great interest in the Ordovician\r\nrocks is that of the first fish. They were found in Colorado, but\r\nthey are very much shattered and tell us very little about the\r\nanimals they represent. These fish were covered with plates, and were\r\nevidently thus defended against attack, so that we may surmise the\r\nexistence of some other animal that preyed on fishes. Whether these\r\nfishes were themselves ferocious we cannot, however, say. But that\r\nwhich was the chief characteristic of the Ordovician era was the\r\nclimax of the trilobite. More than half of all the known trilobites\r\nwere present in Ordovician times. Only a few of these came over from\r\nthe Cambrian, while the others make their first appearance in this\r\nperiod. In the next period (Silurian) their numbers fell to one half,\r\nand in later periods declined still further, till they disappeared\r\naltogether at the close of the Palæozoic era. Some of these curious\r\nanimals appear to have been able to move very quickly; others would\r\nroll themselves up like hedgehogs to defend themselves against\r\nattack; and some of the larger ones were from eighteen inches to\r\ntwo feet in length. Next to these in interest were the cephalopod\r\ntypes, marine animals, that may have resembled the swimming nautilus\r\nof to-day in some of their developments. They attained to enormous\r\nsizes, some of the shells being twelve to fifteen feet in length and\r\na foot in greatest diameter. From this maximum they ranged down to\r\nforms smaller than a pipe-stem. Their habits are to be gathered only\r\nfrom their structure and from the habits of their relations in the\r\npresent seas. Perhaps they floated, shell uppermost, or crawled upon\r\nthe bottom and preyed on a variety of the weaker forms of life. There\r\nappear to have been fewer worms, perhaps because the muddy and chalky\r\nsea bottoms of the Ordovician period were less congenial to them than\r\nthe Cambrian sands.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the structure of the earth's crust which brought\r\nthe Ordovician period to an end marked also the beginning of the\r\nSilurian period. These changes affected sometimes small areas\r\nand were very intense; sometimes they affected larger areas more\r\nslightly. It must not be assumed, however, that these changes were\r\nnecessarily sudden or violent. In examining the rocks now, we see\r\nmerely the effects, and of these effects it is the more remarkable\r\nalone which have survived the march of ages. There was more water on\r\nthe earth's surface then than now; and side by side with continuous\r\nstorms of tropical violence, it is extremely likely that volcanoes\r\nand earthquake movements were more frequent and more considerable\r\nin their effects. The tide of movement by material things may have\r\nbeen faster; and certain it is that the land was now lifting itself\r\nup above the shallow seas. Mountains were being built along the\r\ncoast-lines; behind the coast-lines the continents were shouldering\r\ntheir way upwards in large land areas. North America began to show\r\nin this period the first signs of becoming a continent; Europe's\r\ncountries, or some of them, assumed a distinct existence. With the\r\nadvent of mountains came streams and rivers; and the streams, fed\r\nby the abundant rainfalls, rushed down to the seas in torrents that\r\nperformed the work of erosion with a rapidity perhaps unequalled by\r\neven the greatest rivers of our present-day knowledge--though at\r\nfirst the land areas were not large enough to give rise to streams\r\nas long as great rivers like the Amazon or Mississippi. We cannot\r\nsay exactly what the areas and localities of the water and the land\r\nwere; but it is safe to assume that at the beginning of the Silurian\r\nperiod beds of sediment brought down by the rivers and the rain\r\nwere accumulating about the borders of the land, and as far out as\r\nthe waves and currents were able to convey the earth materials. The\r\nclimate was still equable and was much the same over great areas of\r\nthe world's surface, for the forests of warm temperate latitude are,\r\nin part, the same as those in Arctic regions. Certain parts of the\r\nland appear to have been desert.\r\n\r\nLife began to change a great deal in Silurian times. The extensive\r\nwithdrawal of the sea from great stretches of submerged surface\r\nreduced the area of shallow water available for the forms of life\r\nthat had so richly peopled it during the Ordovician period. Then\r\nthere came an age during which the sea invaded some of the regions\r\nof the earth's crust, and again withdrew, leaving behind it great\r\nstretches of water which gradually grew more intensely salt. All\r\nthese things had naturally a great effect on the development of the\r\nplants and animals of Silurian times. We cannot in a brief summary\r\nof this kind do more than indicate some of the more conspicuous\r\nfeatures. Corals began to spread through the clearer seas: and reef\r\nbuilding on a great scale took place, generally some distance from\r\nthe shores of the land. Other life in great abundance and variety\r\ngathered upon or about these reefs, and they became rich depositories\r\nof the animals of their day. The Crinoids, which, though animals,\r\nare sometimes called the lilies of the sea, developed strongly;\r\nsea urchins appeared, and forms akin to barnacles. The ancestors\r\nof the pearl oyster and the mussel date from Silurian times; and\r\nso do the first Ammonites, those creatures known to the youngest\r\ncollectors of fossils, and deriving their names from the Canaanitish\r\ngod Ammon, which had a ram's head. Sea scorpions, sand fleas, king\r\ncrabs, sea squirts, and worms and fishes of various kinds haunted\r\nthe Silurian seas. The Silurian fish were most of them armed for\r\ndefence, some with plates of bone; some of them had their tails\r\nstiffly joined to their backbones; some had skin like a prickly\r\npear; some were not unlike the modern shark. The plants have left\r\nus many records--liverworts, ferns, and club-like mosses. The\r\ngrowing vegetation gave a new impulse to insect life--plant-lice\r\nand cockchafers and the scorpions we have named: and the vastness\r\nof their numbers is shown by the fact that they have outlasted the\r\nchanges and vicissitudes of a myriad generations.\r\n\r\nWe may conclude this chapter by saying what we imagine of the general\r\nappearance of our own islands to have been. At the close of the\r\nSilurian period Britain was probably an archipelago, ranging over\r\nten degrees of latitude, like many of the island groups now found\r\nin the great Pacific Ocean; the old gneissic hills of the western\r\ncoast of Scotland, culminating in the granite range of Ben Nevis,\r\nand stretching to the Southern Grampians, forming the nucleus of\r\none island group; the South Highlands of Scotland, ranging from\r\nthe Lammermuir Hills, another; the Pennine chain and the Malvern\r\nHills, the third and most easterly group; the Shropshire and Welsh\r\nmountains, a fourth; and Devon and Cornwall stretching far to the\r\nsouth and west. Every spot of the island lying now at a lower\r\nelevation than 800 feet above the sea was under water at the close of\r\nthe Silurian period, except in those instances where depression by\r\nsubsidence has since occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nHOW THE COAL BEDS WERE LAID DOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn following the history of the rocks, we shall have presently to\r\nspeak of that period which embraces the strata which contain coal.\r\nThe geologists who lived in the early part of last century--William\r\nSmith and others--noticed that beneath the coal-bearing strata\r\nthere lay a considerable thickness of red sandy beds containing the\r\nremains of fresh-water fishes, shells, and plants, while above the\r\ncoaly strata they found another thick mass of red sandstone. To the\r\nlower and older red rocks they consequently gave the name of Old Red\r\nSandstone, and to the upper and newer ones the name of the New Red\r\nSandstone. The Old Red Sandstone formation, therefore, lies between\r\nthe Silurian rocks below and the rocks of the coal period above. But\r\nin Devonshire we find a considerable thickness of shales, slates, and\r\nlimestones containing _marine_ fossils, and these also lie between\r\nthese two formations, and must therefore be somewhere about the\r\nsame period, or geological age, as the Old Red Sandstone. The name\r\n\"Devonian\" has therefore been given to these shales, slates, and\r\nlimestones, which were evidently being deposited in an open sea at\r\nor about the same time at which the Old Red Sandstone strata were\r\nbeing laid down on the floors of inland fresh-water lakes.\r\n\r\nIn the west of England the Old Red Sandstone stretches from Hereford\r\nand Monmouth into the neighbouring Welsh counties of Brecknock\r\nand Glamorgan. It is here at its greatest thickness of nearly two\r\nmiles. The lower part consists of red and yellow sandstones, marls,\r\nand shales, with a certain kind of limestone concrete. The red\r\ncolour is due to iron, and wherever this is abundant fossils are\r\nscarce, though remains of fishes have been found in it. Scotland\r\nis the classic ground of the Old Red Sandstone, for it was here\r\nthat Hugh Miller, when a working mason at Cromarty, first collected\r\nits wonderful fossil fishes. Hugh Miller's discovery is one of the\r\nromances of geological annals. \"Let any one picture to himself,\"\r\nwrote the late Mr. Bristow, \"the surprise he would feel should he, on\r\ntaking his first lesson in geology, and on first breaking a stone--a\r\npebble, for instance, exhibiting every external sign of a water-worn\r\nsurface--find, to appropriate Archdeacon Paley's illustration, a\r\nwatch, or any other delicate piece of mechanism, in its centre.\r\nNow this, many years ago, is exactly the kind of surprise that\r\nHugh Miller experienced in the sandstone quarry opened in a lofty\r\nwall of cliff overhanging the northern shore of the Moray Frith.\r\nHe had picked up a nodular mass of blue Lias limestone, which he\r\nlaid open by a stroke of the hammer, when, behold! an exquisitely\r\nshaped Ammonite was displayed before him. It is no surprising that\r\nhenceforth the half mason, half sailor, and poet, became a geologist.\r\nHe sought for information, and found it; he found that the rocks\r\namong which he laboured swarmed with the relics of a former age. He\r\npursued his investigations, and found, while working in this zone\r\nof strata all around the coast, that a certain class of fossils\r\nabounded; but that in a higher zone these familiar forms disappeared,\r\nand others made their appearance.\r\n\r\n\"He read and learned that in other lands--lands of more recent\r\nformation--strange forms of animal life had been discovered; forms\r\nwhich in their turn had disappeared, to be succeeded by others, more\r\nin accordance with beings now living. He came to know that he was\r\nsurrounded, in his native mountains, by the sedimentary deposits of\r\nother ages; he became alive to the fact that these grand mountain\r\nranges had been built up grain by grain in the bed of the ocean, and\r\nthe mountains had been subsequently raised to their present level\r\nby the upheaval of one part of its bed, or by the subsidence of\r\nanother....\" _The Old Red Sandstone_, a book which was the result of\r\nHugh Miller's researches, is a geological classic.\r\n\r\nThere are three other regions in England and Scotland where the Old\r\nRed Sandstone is conspicuous, and all of them were probably old\r\nfresh-water lakes of great extent in which sands accumulated. Sir\r\nArchibald Geikie has named them the Welsh Lake, Lake Cheviot, Lake\r\nCaledonia, Lake Arcadie, Lake Lorne. There are similar sandy deposits\r\nin Russia, in North America, near the Catskill Mountains, and in many\r\nparts of Canada; and there is little doubt that in all these places\r\nthere were great lakes which gradually became the depositories of\r\nrivers and developed a life of their own.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable fossils of these deposits were the fishes. The\r\nfishes began to appear in the later Silurian: they are strikingly\r\nabundant in Devonian times. The most remarkable of them are fishes\r\nwhich are only just like fishes after having been developed out of,\r\nor perhaps descending from, some other form of life. These fishes are\r\nnow called the _Ostracoderm_ group, and they bear strange resemblance\r\nto some of the trilobites and the king crabs of previous eras. The\r\n_Pteraspis_ is one of the earliest of these strange creatures, and\r\nits \"fins,\" very much developed, were used as oars. Perhaps the most\r\ncurious of all these strange creatures were the _Pterichthyds_ or\r\nwinged fish; though it is not at all likely that the appendages we\r\ncall wings were used for aerial flight. These fishes were all small;\r\ntheir forms were clumsy and their powers of moving about small. They\r\nhad poor mouths and eyes, and they probably ploughed the soft bottoms\r\nof the sluggish waters, above which little besides their peculiarly\r\nplaced eyes and the backs of their plated bucklers were habitually\r\nexposed. Another strange class of fish-like creatures was represented\r\nby a little creature which was found in Scotland and is sometimes\r\nsupposed to be the ancestor of the lamprey.\r\n\r\nBesides the fresh-water fishes there were some which dwelt in the\r\nsea; but in the Devonian era the fresh-water fishes were far more\r\nnumerous. We cannot mention them all. The fish called _Coccosteus_\r\nand its allies had great bony plates of considerable thickness on\r\nits head and shoulders (some fine examples are to be seen at the\r\nNatural History Museum, Cromwell Road, London), but its tail and\r\nmiddle body were left unprotected. The sharks of to-day had their\r\nrepresentatives among the Devonian fishes. Sharks have throughout\r\ngeological time nearly always been sea-dwellers, though they still\r\noccasionally live in fresh water, as in Lake Baikal in Siberia and\r\nLake Nicaragua. It seems clear, however, that in the Devonian period\r\nthey lived in the open sea. But their remains are found in the Old\r\nRed Sandstone, and therefore it is likely that they lived in fresh\r\nand brackish waters also. In the same strata as these remarkable\r\nfishes there are found some large and peculiar crustaceans, something\r\nlike our modern king crabs, but reaching the enormous length of six\r\nfeet. There have also been mussels found and a few water plants, but\r\nnot many.\r\n\r\nIn the Devonian relics the land vegetation has for the first time\r\nbeen fairly well preserved. The huge club mosses made good their\r\ntenure on the land; and along the flats and low-lying lands by the\r\nrivers there were dense brakes of reedy calamites and masses of true\r\nferns. The club mosses and the calamites diminished from their giant\r\nsize eventually, but the ferns went on increasing, and ancestral\r\ntypes of the pines and the yews began to appear. The vegetation of\r\nDevonian times was sombre; there could have been no flowers, and the\r\ninsects were not of the kind that speed from bloom to bloom. Insects\r\nthere were, gigantic dragon-flies and insects akin to the many flies\r\nthat haunt the water; but the myriad buzz of insect life as we know\r\nit in field and forest was not yet heard. It is rather an interesting\r\nfact that unmistakable evidence has been collected of the existence\r\nin Devonian times of those smallest of living things, the bacteria.\r\n\r\nOf the general distribution of the land we cannot speak with great\r\ncertainty. The violent disturbances of Silurian times seem to have\r\nceased, but movements of the land did not cease. Great parts of\r\nEngland were rising from the water, and stretching out above the\r\nwaves to Belgium and Northern France. There was no German Ocean and\r\nno St. George's Channel at the end of the period; and Scotland,\r\nalso rising above the waves, was accumulating deposits of volcanic\r\nash and lava. While, however, the British Isles and great parts of\r\nBelgium, Denmark, Scandinavia, and Western Russia, and smaller areas\r\nin mid-France, mid-Germany, and the Balkans were rising the rest of\r\nEurope was submerged beneath the waters. In the United States there\r\nwere similar risings and sinkings of the land, but, on the whole, the\r\ncourse of geological history seems to have been more peaceful across\r\nthe Atlantic. In Europe, as in America, there do not seem to have\r\nbeen notable changes at the end of the Devonian, though there was\r\nsome alteration in level in Russia, Bohemia, and Great Britain. The\r\nrolling waste of waters south of the Bristol Channel began to deepen.\r\n\r\nThe continental area in which the Old Red Sandstone lakes lay (a kind\r\nof far Western Europe without a Russia) began now to sink in its\r\nturn. All of the British Isles, except a very thin slice just cut\r\nacross the Midlands from North Wales to Norfolk, was sunk beneath\r\nthe sea. The lakes disappeared, and above their deposits, as above\r\nthe rest of England and nearly all Europe except Scandinavia and\r\npatches of Spain, Italy, and the Balkans, a deep ocean rolled, and\r\nfor many thousands of years deposited a grey ooze of limestone. This\r\nlimestone is called the Carboniferous or Mountain Limestone. But as\r\ntime went on this old sea floor began to be slowly raised, and in\r\nthe shallower waters a great quantity of coarse sand and stones and\r\nconglomerate--the Millstone Grit, as it is called--was deposited.\r\nLimestone denotes clear seas; but the borders of clear seas are often\r\nthe sites of accumulation of land rocks, and the clear waters of the\r\nearly Carboniferous sea which stretched from Ireland to the north of\r\nEurope were bordered by shores along which mud and shale, gravel and\r\nsand were deposited.\r\n\r\nThe end of this period was marked in Europe by great disturbances\r\nof the earth's crust--though perhaps these disturbances, as we have\r\nshown in a previous chapter, were not sudden or violent, but were\r\nslow upheavals, lasting hundreds of thousands of years. It was at\r\nthis time that a great system of mountains, sometimes referred to\r\nas the Palæozoic Alps, began to rise. This system of mountains\r\ncrossed the central part of Europe from the Western Islands to the\r\nSudetes Mountains in the east. Their remnants are seen in the Vosges\r\nMountains, the Hartz Mountains, and the Black Forest at the present\r\ntime; and the development of the Ural Mountains was contemporaneous\r\nwith them. During this time a mild climate spread all over Europe,\r\nand as far north as Spitzbergen the waters were warm enough to\r\nsupport coral reefs and plants which we associate with the seas of\r\ngenial latitudes. In time the Carboniferous sea became quite filled\r\nup; and its floor was raised up to or a little above the waters. Then\r\nin great swamps, marshes, and low lands, the burgeoning vegetable\r\nlife of the northern hemisphere entered on its long-deferred reign.\r\nIt was then that the coal which we burn in our grates to-day was laid\r\ndown. Let us consider the circumstances in which coal is to be found.\r\nThe coal formations, as we know them, are found in the same state,\r\nand evidently laid down in the same era, from the Equator up to\r\nMelville Island in the Arctic regions, where in our day it is always\r\nfreezing. They stretch from Nova Zembla to the middle of China; and\r\nthey are much the same in New Zealand and New South Wales. Therefore\r\nthe first conclusion we draw was that nearly all over the globe the\r\nclimate was the same--hot, close, moist, muggy. Whatever the climate\r\nwas the growth of vegetation was tremendous.\r\n\r\nWe shall have presently to say a little more about the vegetation;\r\nbut for the present we need only say that it was very different\r\nfrom the vegetation with which most of us are familiar. Imagine a\r\nhot, damp atmosphere, a kind of perpetual warm fog through which\r\nthe rays of the sun struggled with difficulty, and where rain fell\r\non most days of the year--a perpetual steaming hothouse. There\r\nwas little variety in the appearance of the vast forest swamps.\r\nIt certainly possessed, wrote Louis Figuier, the advantage of\r\nsize and rapid growth; but how poor it was in species--how uniform\r\nin appearance! No flowers yet adorned the foliage or varied the\r\ntints of the forests. Eternal verdure clothed the branches of the\r\nFerns, the Lycopods (club mosses), and Equiseta, which composed to\r\na great extent the vegetation of the age. The forests presented an\r\ninnumerable collection of individuals, but very few species, and all\r\nbelonging to the lower types of vegetation. No fruit appeared fit for\r\nnourishment; none would seem to have been on the branches. Suffice\r\nit to say that few land animals seem to have existed yet; while the\r\nvegetable kingdom occupied the land, which at a later period was more\r\nthickly inhabited by air-breathing animals. A few winged insects gave\r\nanimation to the air while exhibiting their variegated colours; and\r\nmany mollusca (such as land-snails) lived at the same time.\r\n\r\nUltimately all this richness of vegetation became by decay, by\r\ncompression, by submergence, perhaps by being buried under earthquake\r\nmovements and volcanic outbreaks, converted into coal; and we\r\nmay now ask how long did this process take. A vigorous growth of\r\nvegetation has been estimated to yield annually about one ton of\r\ndried vegetable matter per acre, or 640 tons to the square mile. If\r\nthis annual growth of vegetable matter were all preserved for 1000\r\nyears, and compressed till it was as dense and heavy as coal, it\r\nwould form a layer about seven inches thick. But a large portion of\r\nthe vegetable matter even in peat bogs escapes as gas in the making\r\nof coal. Four-fifths of it escapes in this way. If this be true the\r\nseven-inch layer would be reduced to less than one and a half inches,\r\nand a layer a foot in thickness would require between 8000 and 9000\r\nyears. The aggregate thickness of coal is frequently as much as 100\r\nfeet (when all the thicknesses of the seams are added together), and\r\nsometimes as much as 250 feet. At the foregoing rate of accumulation\r\nperiods ranging from 1,000,000 to 2,500,000 years would be needed\r\nfor the accumulation of such thicknesses of coal. It must be borne\r\nin mind that much depends on the rate of growth of Carboniferous\r\nvegetation, which may have been, and probably was, much more rapid\r\nthan any we know outside tropical forests. On the other hand, we\r\nhave been speaking of the aggregate thickness of the coal beds only.\r\nThe greater part of the coal-bearing strata consists of shale and\r\nsandstone with layers or seams of coal like streaky bacon. Of the\r\nshale and sandstone there are thousands of feet, even where the\r\nsediments are fine and their accumulations therefore probably slow.\r\nFor, as we have said, this was a period of great change, in which\r\nthe forests were always sinking and rising again, being submerged by\r\nlakes, being covered by the sea, and again emerging as islands, to be\r\noverrun by vegetation.\r\n\r\n    As sinks some sylvan scene in all its pride\r\n    Changed to lagoons of overflowing tide,\r\n    Assiduous labours Land to win again\r\n    Her leafy breadths, invaded by the main.\r\n    Down bring the rivers to the flooded shore\r\n    Cargoes of shale and silt that slow restore\r\n    The sunken glebes, till they again can hold\r\n    Thick ferny brakes, and forests as of old.\r\n\r\n(H. R. Knipe.)\r\n\r\nIt would hardly seem unreasonable to suppose that these depositions,\r\nand the changes that brought them about, might have occupied as\r\nmuch time as the formation of the coal beds. This would double the\r\nfigures, and make this period last something between two million and\r\nfive million years.\r\n\r\nIn the coal as we know it are the remains of great forest trees;\r\ngigantic tree-ferns for the most part, and of many small plants\r\nforming a close thick sod, partially buried in whole countries of\r\nmarsh land.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows those marsh plants, which bear the vulgar name of\r\n\"mare's-tail.\" These humble plants were represented during the coal\r\nperiod by trees from twenty to thirty feet high and four to six\r\ninches in diameter. Their trunks have been preserved to us: they bear\r\nthe name of _Calamites_.\r\n\r\nThe _Lycopods_ of our age are humble plants, scarcely a yard in\r\nheight, and most commonly creepers; but those of the ancient world\r\nwere trees of eighty or ninety feet in height. Their leaves were\r\nsometimes twenty inches long, and their trunks a yard in diameter.\r\nSuch are the dimensions of some specimens which have been found.\r\nAnother Lycopod of this period attained dimensions still more\r\ncolossal. The _Sigillarias_ sometimes exceeded 100 feet in height.\r\nHerbaceous Ferns were also exceedingly abundant and grew beneath\r\nthe shade of these gigantic trees. It was the combination of these\r\nlofty trees with the undergrowth of smaller vegetation which formed\r\nthe forests of the Carboniferous period. \"What could be more\r\nsurprising,\" exclaims Figuier, \"than the aspect of this exuberant\r\nvegetation, these immense trees, these elegant arborescent ferns\r\nwith airy foliage, fine cut, like delicate lace. Nothing at the\r\npresent day can convey to us an idea of the prodigious and immense\r\nextent of never-changing verdure which clothed the earth, from pole\r\nto pole, under the high temperature which everywhere prevailed over\r\nthe whole terrestrial globe. In the depths of these inextricable\r\nforests parasitic plants were suspended from the trunks of the great\r\ntrees, in tufts or garlands, like the wild vines of our tropical\r\nforests. They were nearly all pretty, fern-like plants, they attached\r\nthemselves to the stems of the great trees, like the orchids of our\r\ntimes.\" The margin of the waters would also be covered with various\r\nplants with light and whorled leaves, belonging, perhaps, to the\r\nDicotyledons. Before leaving the subject of the plants of the coal\r\nmeasures, we should perhaps mention as one of the most interesting\r\ndiscoveries of the present generation that whereas the links between\r\nthe fern-like trees of those days and the cycads, or early group of\r\nseed-bearing plants, were for long missing, they have been found by\r\nthe researches of Professor F. W. Oliver, F.R.S., who has identified\r\nin the _Lyginodendron_ a seed-bearing fern from the coal measures.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to the less interesting but not less important topic\r\nof the animal life of the Carboniferous period. At the beginning of\r\nthe period when only a small portion of the British Isles was above\r\nthe waters, and an ocean rolled from Ireland to China, the life of\r\nwhich the most important relics were left was that of the sea. In\r\nthe early Carboniferous seas the rhizopods, some small as dust, laid\r\ndown with their tiny shells the foundations of mountains yet to be;\r\nthe \"sea lilies\" were at the height of their pride, occupying vast\r\nareas in the flowing tide; forms like the present-day nautilus began\r\nto appear, and the \"lamp-shells\" attained their greatest size. The\r\ntrilobites, hitherto the most conspicuous and noticeable animals of\r\nthe earth's childhood, were beginning to die out, vanquished in the\r\nstruggle for life by more adaptable forms, and the big sea scorpions\r\nwere waning fast. The king crabs and the water fleas still throve,\r\nand the fishes, though most of them not very large, were growing\r\nlarger, some of them taking the appearance of the dog-fish, some of\r\nthe ray, some of the shark; and, what is more important than the\r\nfact of size, the fishes were growing speedier and more capable of\r\nattacking weaker creatures.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these ages the sea invaded the land; and shores\r\nwhere land-snails and millipedes and centipedes, beetles and\r\nscorpions, spiders and cockroaches had found a home became entirely\r\nchanged, not only in their appearance and character, but in the\r\ntype which subsisted on them. It is possible (for something of the\r\nkind has been noticed in our own days in the West Indies, where\r\na sea-crab species is showing signs of becoming a land animal)\r\nthat some of the forms of water animals became used to living in\r\nshallower and shallower water as the generations went on till they\r\nbecame partly land and partly water animals--amphibians, as they\r\nare called. Thus small newt-like beings, moving clumsily through\r\nthe swamps, made their appearance, and others with stronger limbs\r\npushed onwards through the forest. Others in form resembling snakes\r\ncrept through the mud and lived among the swamps by the side of the\r\nsea. Not much is known of the food and life-habits of any of these\r\namphibians. From their teeth we may perhaps judge that they lived on\r\nfish, crustaceans, insects, and on one another, and their predatory\r\nlife sometimes led them to climb trees in search of food. What,\r\nhowever, is most important about the amphibian is that they were the\r\npioneers of the march of those creatures which had backbones--the\r\nvertebrates--from the sea to the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF REPTILES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already said that in the many hundreds of thousands of\r\nyears which went by during Carboniferous times the sea sometimes\r\nadvanced and sometimes receded, and nothing shows this better than\r\nthe great thickness of the deposits in which the coal lies in\r\nseams. In America, as in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New\r\nZealand, South and Central America, the Carboniferous system is\r\nfound. In Arkansas, in North America, the coal measures attain the\r\nremarkable thickness of 18,000 feet; in the Wasatch Mountains the\r\nCarboniferous strata have been estimated to be 13,000 feet thick,\r\nand in silver-bearing Nevada 10,000 feet. The formations of the\r\nWestern European coal measures, like those of Eastern North America,\r\nconsist principally of shales and clays, with smaller amounts of\r\nsandstone and limestone. They attain great thickness, and, including\r\n5500 feet of the Millstone Grit, are 13,500 feet thick in Lancashire\r\nand several thousand feet thick in many parts of Great Britain and\r\nIreland. The extraordinary thicknesses show that near our islands\r\nmust have been a very extensive and lofty area of land. In Germany\r\nthe same strata, thickly seamed with coal, are 10,000 feet thick.\r\nThere must also have been considerable volcanic or earthquake\r\naction as we know, because in Germany, near the Hartz Mountains and\r\nelsewhere, there are many igneous rocks thrust into the strata,\r\nand also because in Belgium and in France the coal strata are very\r\nmuch twisted and contorted. The same or similar beds are found in\r\nSiberia, in Japan, and in China, where the coal beds are said to be\r\nthicker than anywhere else in the world. The Carboniferous system\r\nis also found in Africa, in the north, south-east, and south of the\r\ncontinent; and in Australia and New Zealand Carboniferous strata to\r\nthe thickness of 10,000 feet are indicated.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this period the changes ever taking place transformed\r\nthe conditions of life in a way the reverse of that which we have\r\nhitherto been examining. So far each age has shown an increase\r\nof life on the age preceding it. But when the great outburst of\r\ncarboniferous activity began to wane it was followed by a lessening\r\nof the wave of life. As we said in the last chapter, there lie on the\r\ntop of the coal-bearing strata beds to which the older geologists\r\ngave the name of New Red Sandstone. But in 1841 the New Red Sandstone\r\nwas divided into two distinct geological formations. To the lower\r\nand older part Murchison gave in 1841 the name of Permian (from\r\n_Perm_ or _Permia_, an ancient kingdom in Russia, where red sandy\r\nrocks of this age form nearly all the surface), but in Germany it\r\nis more frequently called the Dyas (from Lat. _duo_, two), because\r\nin that country it is composed of _two_ well-marked divisions--red\r\nsandstones below and magnesian limestones above. Thus there are two\r\ntypes of this Permian formation: the Permian type proper--a mixed\r\nseries of red sandstones, marls, shales, and limestones, with some\r\nthin beds of coal, as found in Russia; and the Dyassic type, as seen\r\nin Germany.\r\n\r\nWe do not know what brought about the change: though we do know\r\nthat during it there was great volcanic activity over Europe and\r\nthat the waning forests of vegetation and the steaming swamps gave\r\nplace to desert plains. Vegetation sank lower and lower. The forests\r\ndisappeared or dwelt only in clusters. The soft sappy trees gave\r\nplace to hardy pines which clung to the plains and the mountains, and\r\nother sterner types began to appear, allied to the spruces, yews,\r\nand ginkgo. The ginkgo tree is one of the oldest of the tree type\r\nwhich now has a living representative. Any reader interested enough\r\nin the matter to walk along Royal Hospital Road, Chelsea, will find a\r\nginkgo tree just outside the Old Physic Garden; and of course a good\r\nmany other examples are preserved in botanic gardens. The cycads,\r\noffshoots of the ferns, through the strange group of trees known as\r\nthe cycado-filices, spread through the woods.\r\n\r\nThe trilobites, to turn to animal life, all but disappeared,\r\nthough one elegant example remained; the corals were changing; and\r\nthe lamp-shells were dropping out. There were a few new species\r\nof fishes, but none of any great strength or capacity, and all\r\npreserving still the tail which is part of the backbone. There was an\r\nall-round impoverishment of life--so great, indeed, that the early\r\ngeologists used to believe that a complete destruction of all life\r\nfollowed this, the closing stage of the Palæozoic era, and that a\r\nre-creation followed. They would have been confirmed in this belief\r\nhad they but known that intense cold and glaciation were setting\r\nin where the tropics were situated and that the dryness of vast\r\ndeserts was sweeping away life elsewhere. But we now know that life\r\nwas not entirely lost; that many species survived, and that others,\r\naltering to suit altering conditions, became stronger in the process.\r\nNevertheless, life was greatly impoverished. A census made a few\r\nyears ago gave the known animal species of the Carboniferous period\r\nas 10,000, while those of the Permian period were only 300, or three\r\nper cent. Possibly the percentage was larger than that, but still it\r\nwas small.\r\n\r\nBut if the Permian was poor in life it was very interesting. The\r\namphibians had been growing in strength during the later stages of\r\nthe Carboniferous age, and may possibly have been more numerous then\r\nthan at any other time, for the vast swamps were very favourable for\r\nthem. They diminished in the Permian, though the Permian amphibians\r\nshowed some advances, and began to assume a likeness to reptiles.\r\nPerhaps the reptiles may have first appeared in the Carboniferous,\r\nbut they declared themselves in the Permian age. Two great branches\r\nof reptiles seem already to have defined themselves; perhaps they\r\nhad never formed a common group as reptiles, but had separated while\r\nstill amphibians. The one bore resemblance to, and were perhaps the\r\nforerunners of, the great hosts of lizards, crocodiles, dinosaurs,\r\nichthyosaurs, and flying saurians, which are the most pronounced\r\nof the reptiles, and of which we shall have a great deal to say\r\npresently. The other group were perhaps the ancestors of the turtles\r\nand plesiosaurs which appeared later, and possibly led the way to\r\nthe mammals. This rapid and diverse spreading out of the reptiles\r\nin a period when life as a whole was at a low ebb is not a little\r\nremarkable. These creatures seem to show the arrival of a more\r\npronounced form of _air-breathing_ animal; and that may have been the\r\nconsequence of the presence of more oxygen in the earth's atmosphere.\r\nOf the Permian amphibians, one of the most interesting was like the\r\nSphenodon, which still creeps about the northern islands of New\r\nZealand. The most striking of the reptiles was the _Naosaurus_, a\r\nbeast-like creature with a high back of spines webbed together like a\r\nsolid porcupine. It was from three to ten feet in length.\r\n\r\nAll these changes were brought about by the general withdrawal of\r\nthe sea, both in the North American continent and in Europe. In both\r\ncontinents there are beds which accumulated fresh water; in both beds\r\nwhich were laid down in salt lakes or inland seas; and in both beds\r\nwhich were laid down on the floor of seas washing the continents.\r\nGreat areas seem to have been sometimes dry and sometimes submerged;\r\nother and greater areas, bordered by ice and sometimes swept by icy\r\nblasts, or subject to burning sun in summer, were deserts such as\r\nwe are aware of now in Asia or North Africa or mid-Australia, but\r\nmuch larger in extent than any of these. It was in conditions such\r\nas these that the ancient or Palæozoic rocks came to an end and the\r\nMesozoic or Middle Period began.\r\n\r\nThe Middle period of strata and of the life which those strata have\r\npreserved has usually been separated from the older rocks because,\r\nowing to the great period of arid desert conditions, the character of\r\nlife changed a great deal; but fuller knowledge shows that the links\r\nwere still there, and that ceaseless adaptation of animals to their\r\nsurroundings was ceaselessly going on. We need not follow closely\r\nall the changes and relationships, and only much greater knowledge\r\nthan geologists yet possess will enable them to trace all the\r\nalterations of the land and sea. But we may trace the alterations in\r\nthe appearance of the continents in broad outline. Nearly the whole\r\nextent of the British Isles was now above the sea, and was enjoying a\r\nclimate perhaps as cold as present-day Iceland. To the south and east\r\nof Scotland was a great shallow inland lake, while north of Great\r\nBritain a huge plain stretched across Europe. To the south of the\r\nlake was a belt of land, and farther south still the sea had invaded\r\nItaly and reached to Southern Germany, and in this sea was being\r\nlaid down the limestone which in later eras was to be elevated into\r\nthe mountains of the Apennines, the Alps, and the Pyrenees. North\r\nAfrica was under water, but farther south the uplifted lands were\r\njoining hands with India. Sea swept part of Asia, but North America\r\nwas larger and broader than it is now, her western coast stretching\r\nfarther out into the ocean.\r\n\r\nIn this period, which is called the Triassic (the name given to it\r\nby the German geologist Bronn because of the three distinct beds\r\nhe found in it, though the middle of these, a shelly limestone,\r\ndoes not exist in Great Britain), there was a wide development of\r\nlarge reptiles and amphibians. We cannot enumerate them all, for\r\nnot one chapter nor one volume would suffice to deal adequately\r\nwith the reptiles of the Trias formations and of the Jurassic rocks\r\nwhich followed them, and of the Permian which preceded them. But\r\nwe may speak of some of them. One of the most striking was the\r\n_Pareiasaurus_, which has been found in the Jurassic sandstones and\r\nlimestones of South Africa, of Russia, of India and Scotland, and of\r\nmiddle England. The skeleton of the Pareiasaurus looks like that of a\r\ngigantic pug dog eight feet long; but it was a comparatively harmless\r\nanimal, the teeth of which show that it largely fed on vegetable food.\r\n\r\nIn Sir E. Ray Lankester's lectures on \"Extinct Animals\" he described\r\nthe finding of a great many of these fossil reptiles by Professor\r\nAmalitzky on the banks of the River Dwina, near Archangel. There is a\r\ncliff of Permian strata on the banks of the Dwina, and in this cliff\r\nthere is a peculiar pocket or accumulation of sandy matter with large\r\nhard nodules embedded in it. These nodules are removed and broken up\r\nfor mending the roads. The pocket seems to be in a fissure and of\r\nTriassic age, later, that is to say, than the Permian rocks on either\r\nside of it. However that may be, the nodules are usually removed\r\nfor road-mending, and four or five years ago Professor Amalitzky on\r\nvisiting the spot was astounded and delighted to find that when\r\nbroken each nodule was seen to contain the skeleton or skull of\r\na great reptile. The Russian geologist determined to make a most\r\nthorough investigation of this wonderful deposit, and for years spent\r\nseveral thousand pounds in having the nodules dug out by the peasants\r\nafter the year's farming work was over, and in removing them to the\r\nUniversity of Warsaw, where with the finest instruments and greatest\r\ncare the nodules are opened, and each bone removed in fragments is\r\nput together from its more or less broken parts, and firmly cemented\r\nand set up in its natural position as a complete skeleton.\r\n\r\nThese Pareiasaurs reconstructed by Professor Amalitzky were about as\r\nbig as well-grown cattle, but not so high on the legs. Living at the\r\nsame time, and its skeleton now found near them, was an enormous and\r\ntruly terrible flesh-eating animal, with a skull two feet long and\r\nenormous tiger-like teeth. This creature was named Inostransevia.\r\nNo doubt the vegetarian herds of Pareiasaurus, whose small peg-like\r\nteeth indicate their harmlessness, were preyed on by the terrible\r\nInostransevia, as were their brethren in South Africa devoured by\r\nother carnivorous reptiles of that remote Triassic age. So we see the\r\nco-existence of blood-sucker and victim--of the destructive oppressor\r\nand the helpless oppressed--forced on our attention in these two\r\nlocalities, Russia and South Africa, in days long before man was.\r\nOther land forms were grotesque and curious in shape, the Chelonians\r\nfor example, big birds and crocodiles rolled into one, and clothed\r\nin lizard-like skin--queer pear-shaped brutes with huge hind limbs,\r\nshort fore limbs, narrow chests, and pigmy skulls.\r\n\r\nBoth branches of the reptilian horde, those representing the saurians\r\nand those which were the forerunners of the mammals, sent delegations\r\nto the sea before the close of the Triassic period. The Ichthyosaurs\r\nrepresented the more pronounced reptilian line; the Plesiosaurs were\r\nthe representatives of the coming mammals. It is not difficult to\r\nfind good reason for this movement to the sea. Besides the inevitable\r\ntendency of every masterful race to invade all accessible realms,\r\nthe renewed extension of the sea that set in during the Triassic\r\nperiod and became pronounced before its close, especially invited\r\nthis, for the shallow waters creeping out upon the land with their\r\nnow prolific life set tempting morsels before the voracious reptiles,\r\non the one hand, while on the other, the reduction of the land area\r\nand the restriction of their feeding-grounds, intensified by the\r\nmultiplication of the reptiles themselves, forced a resort to the\r\nsea. One of the reptiles of this period, the _Lariosaurus_, shows by\r\nits development how the change affected the reptiles. In the earlier\r\nstages of the Trias it resembled a rather swollen alligator with four\r\nlimbs symmetrically situated and used for crawling. In the later\r\nforms of these reptiles the limbs were modified with paddles, and all\r\npower to move about on land was lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF REPTILES\r\n\r\n(_Continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Triassic period in its later stages was very like the earlier\r\nperiod of the era which followed it, and the reptiles which were\r\ncharacteristic of the close of the first were continued in some cases\r\nwith only slight differentiation in the second. The Plesiosaurs and\r\nIchthyosaurs are associated with the Trias, and we may therefore\r\ndescribe them now. Though some of these large aquatic creatures must\r\nhave measured thirty feet from snout to tail, they do not equal in\r\nsize the great aquatic mammals of to-day--the whales. In life the\r\nPlesiosaur had a body like the hull of a submarine with four great\r\npaddles attached--the fore and the hind legs. It had a long neck like\r\na gigantic swan, and an elongated head provided with powerful jaws\r\narmed with numerous pointed teeth. It probably could swim under water\r\nas well as on the surface, and when floating could snap small lizards\r\nfrom the land. The paddles have a definite structure like legs, with\r\nfive toes, wrist or ankle, forearm or foreleg, and upper arm or\r\nthigh. A great number of these Plesiosaurs have been found in the\r\nLias formation of the south of England; and slabs containing whole\r\nskeletons have frequently been obtained. They and two similarly\r\nembedded and flattened skeletons of different kinds of Ichthyosaurs\r\nmay be seen in quantity on the wall of the gallery of fossil reptiles\r\nin the Natural History Museum at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nThe Ichthyosaurs were much more fish-like or whale-like in form than\r\nthe Plesiosaurs. \"They were, indeed,\" says Sir E. Ray Lankester,\r\n\"singularly like the porpoises and grampuses among living whales\r\nand stand in the same relation to land-living reptiles that the\r\nporpoises do to land-living mammals. Their fish-like appearance and\r\nfins are not primitive characters and do not indicate any closer\r\nblood relationship to fishes than that possessed by other reptiles.\r\nThey are the offspring of four-legged terrestrial reptiles which\r\nhave become specially modified and adapted to submarine life.\" Like\r\nmany whales, they had a fin on the back devoid of bony support.\r\nThe Ichthyosaur had a ring of bony plates supporting the eyeball\r\n(as birds also have), and these are often preserved in the fossil\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Triassic period some strata were laid down which\r\nhave been called \"Beds of passage.\" We have seen that the Triassic\r\nstrata were probably deposited, altogether or in part, in extensive\r\nsalt lakes or inland seas. At the close of the Triassic period the\r\nwaters of the ocean were admitted to these areas by the sinking of\r\nthe land at some point or other of their margins. With the sea-water\r\ncame many living things--fishes, shells, etc.--and the very scanty\r\nlife of the Triassic lake was replaced by an abundance of marine\r\nlife. These beds were called the Rhætic beds because they were first\r\nfound in the old Roman province of Rhætia, which occupied an Alpine\r\ndistrict between Bavaria and Lombardy. Here they were thickest,\r\n3000 feet of limestones and shales; but they have since been found\r\neither thicker or thinner everywhere in England, and in the United\r\nStates, as well as in other parts of Europe wherever we can find the\r\nLias lying on the Trias. They are especially interesting, because\r\nthey contain the teeth of the earliest known traces of the highest\r\ndivision of the animal kingdom--the mammals. These early mammals\r\nbelonged to the lowest of all the mammalian tribes--the Marsupials,\r\nor pouched animals, now so common in Australia. The little banded\r\nant-eater of South America, which lives upon insects and is about\r\nthe size of a rat, is probably something like the first mammal, the\r\n_Microlestes_, in habit and appearance.\r\n\r\nLet us now return, however, to the reptiles of the Jurassic period.\r\nIt is so called from the Jura Mountains which occupy the north-west\r\nof Switzerland, separating that country from France. They are\r\ncomposed of a thick series of clays, shales, and limestones, to\r\nwhich, in 1829, the name Jurassic was given by the French geologist\r\nBrogniart. It was soon found, however, that the lower rocks of this\r\nperiod were very different from the upper. The lower rocks were very\r\nshaly and clayey with thinnish layers of limestone. These were called\r\nLias. The name Lias is derived from \"layers\"--pronounced broadly by\r\nthe Somerset quarrymen as \"lyers\"--a very suitable name for the lower\r\nbeds of the Lias especially, since the alternation of thin beds of\r\nlimestone and of shale gives to the rock a banded or ribbon-like\r\nappearance, which may well cause the workmen to describe it as\r\noccurring in \"lyers.\"\r\n\r\nTo the upper Jurassic beds, which contained much more limestone and\r\nalso occasional beds of sandstone, the name of Oolite was given. The\r\nOolitic strata have a special interest for English geologists, for\r\nit was in them that William Smith, the west of England surveyor,\r\nfirst made out (about the year 1790) the _order of succession_ of\r\nthe strata, and by this was led to his great discovery that \"strata\r\ncould be identified by their organic remains,\" that is by their\r\nfossils. He noticed that some of the limestone beds of the strata\r\nwe are about to describe consisted of small rounded grains, which\r\nmade them resemble the roe of a fish--indeed, they were called\r\n\"roestone\" by the workmen. Hence Smith--when seeking a name for\r\nthis set of strata--bethought himself of the term \"Oolite,\" which\r\nmeans \"egg-stone\" (Gr. _oon_, an egg, and _lithos_, a stone). Where\r\nthe grains are very large the limestone is called \"pea-grit\" or\r\n_pisolite_ (Lat. _pisum_, a pea). Some beds which contain numerous\r\nand irregularly shaped fragments of shells, corals, etc., are called\r\n_rag-stones_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plesiosaurs\r\n\r\nDifferent species ranged from ten to forty feet in length.]\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic strata of Great Britain were sediments laid down in\r\nwarm seas surrounding an archipelago of which Dartmoor, Wales, and\r\nCumberland formed some of the islands. The whole of Western Europe\r\nwas sinking and had sunk; and the waters of the open ocean were\r\nadmitted into and mingled with the salt mineral waters of the great\r\nTriassic lakes. The change was at first very like what would happen\r\nat the present day if the coast of Palestine were depressed, so\r\nthat the waters of the Mediterranean flowed into the Dead Sea. The\r\nfew fish of the salt lakes were killed; and as the land continued\r\nto sink, the sea at last flowed all over Central and West England,\r\nbringing with it an abundance of marine life. But the reptiles were\r\nfar from being finished with; and the progress of the small mammals\r\nwas extremely slow.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the reptiles. The whale-shaped Ichthyosaurs continued to\r\ndevelop in the seas, and grew larger and larger till some of which\r\nwe have found traces reached a length of forty feet. The long-necked\r\nPlesiosaurs also advanced from strength to strength, and some types\r\ngrew larger. But by this time new breeds were developing, with\r\nshorter necks and larger heads (and consequently larger brain-power),\r\nwhich had a better chance of surviving in the struggle for existence\r\nthan the unwieldy and slow-witted reptiles which preceded them.\r\nThe Ichthyosaurs became more and more fish-like, and some of them\r\ndeveloped the habit of breeding at sea instead of having to return\r\nto the land to deposit their eggs, as do the sea-going turtles and\r\ncrocodiles. Descended from quite a different stock, the Plesiosaurs\r\nadapted themselves to sea life in their own fashion. Instead of\r\nadopting the flowing lines of a fish, the body took on a form more\r\nlike that of a turtle, while the lengthened neck gave rise to the\r\ndescription applied to him since that they had the \"body of a turtle\r\nstrung on a snake.\" At their longest their necks had as many as\r\nseventy-six bones, or vertebræ, which is more than any other animal\r\nliving or extinct ever possessed. A smaller order of crocodiles\r\nappeared and flourished for a time; and the ancestors of the sea\r\nturtles, which were to enjoy so long a reign, began to make their\r\nfirst appearance.\r\n\r\nAmong the land animals the Dinosaurs[16] (or the \"fearful\" saurians)\r\nattained remarkable size and diversity, and their dominant species\r\nwere easily lords of the reptile horde. They developed not only as\r\nflesh-eating monsters, but also in vegetable-eating species. Of the\r\nflesh-eaters the _Ceratosaurus_ was the most terrific. It was only\r\nseventeen feet long, but when standing on its powerful hind legs it\r\ncould have looked in at most first-floor windows, and it used its\r\ncruel fore limbs for seizing and holding prey. Imagine a kangaroo\r\nwith the teeth of a crocodile, the size of an elephant, and the\r\nferocity of a tiger and you will have a fair idea of what you would\r\nhave met in a _Ceratosaurus_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: From Gr. \"_deinos_,\" fearful.]\r\n\r\nThe vegetarian Dinosaurs first became known in this system, but\r\ntheir development was so extraordinary that they soon outranked\r\nthe flesh-eaters both in size and diversity. Among these the\r\n_Brontosaurus_ attained the extraordinary length of sixty feet,\r\nand possibly more. It walked on its four legs, and is one of the\r\nlargest known of all land animals. This enormous creature in spite\r\nof all its size and bulk was yet rather weak than strong. Its\r\ngeneral organisation was unwieldy; the head was very small, and\r\nthe brain hardly bigger than a walnut. The task of providing food\r\nfor such a body must have been a severe tax on so small a head.\r\nThe inconvenience of its bulkiness was perhaps reduced by living\r\nin and about water; but from the excellent preservation of some of\r\nthe skeletons it has been thought that its life was often ended by\r\nsinking in some quicksand or shoal, from which its own massiveness\r\nforbade that the _Brontosaurus_ should extricate itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Ornitholestes      Diplodoci Carnegiei\r\n\r\nFrom skeletons found in Jurassic strata in Wyoming, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n(These reptiles attained a length of about 80 feet.)]\r\nNot greatly removed in habit or appearance from the _Brontosaurus_\r\nwas the _Diplodocus_, a magnificent specimen of which has been set\r\nup in Pittsburg, and a fine replica, owing to the generosity of Mr.\r\nAndrew Carnegie, in the Natural History Museum. The _Diplodocus_,\r\na harmless placid beast, was over eighty feet from the tip of his\r\nsnout to the end of his enormous tail. It has been calculated that\r\nimpulses travel along the nerves to the brain at the rate of about\r\ntwelve yards a second. The rate may have been less in the case of\r\nthe sluggish _Diplodocus_, but in any case it would evidently take\r\nat least two seconds for a nerve impulse to travel the length of\r\nthis reptile; so that if any enemy attacked him at the end of his\r\ntail it would be two seconds before the _Diplodocus_ would realise\r\nthe fact, and perhaps four seconds before he could begin to turn\r\nround to defend himself. Even larger than these was the tremendous\r\n_Brachiosaurus_, who weighed as much as a steam-engine and whose\r\nthigh-bone was nearly eight feet high. These were the largest\r\nreptiles ever known, and may be taken as reaching the point when\r\nbulk becomes a burden, and as signalising an approach to the limit\r\nof evolution in the line of size. Less bulky than these were the\r\n_Stegosaurs_, which were also four-footed. They were curiously\r\narmoured, and formed a group of very remarkable creatures found in\r\nEngland and Western America. While they were less gigantic than\r\nsome of those we have just described, they found compensation\r\nin protective plates, spines, and similar modes of defence. A\r\n_Stegosaurus_ found in Wyoming was probably the most hideous to look\r\nupon; but like his relatives he had an extraordinarily small head\r\nand brain, and was a sluggish creature depending on his ugliness and\r\narmour for protection. Very likely this small size of the brain of\r\ngreat extinct reptiles had to do with the fact of their ceasing to\r\nexist. Animals with bigger and ever-increasing brains outdid them in\r\nthe struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nIt has already been noted that the crowding of the land may have\r\nled some reptiles to take to the sea. The same influence may have\r\nled others to take to the air and thereby escape the monsters of\r\nthe swamps, jungles, and forests. Whatever the cause, the most\r\nstriking and wonderful feature of this period was the development\r\nof flying reptiles. They had just been seen in the Trias. In the\r\nJurassic they appeared fully developed. They doubtless sprang from\r\nsome agile hollow-boned saurian, more or less akin to the slender\r\nleaping Dinosaurs. Between the ponderous Brontosaurs and the airy\r\nPterodactyls was the most striking of contrasts. At first these\r\nbird-like reptiles were small, but later their wings had a spread\r\nof as much as twenty feet, veritable flying dragons. They were not\r\nadorned with feathers, but like bats had leathery membranes stretched\r\nfrom the fore limbs to the body and to the hind limbs. Their heads\r\nwere bird-like, and their jaws at first were set with teeth. They had\r\ntrue powers of flight, as is shown by the discovery of their remains\r\nin places where they must have been far out at sea when they sank\r\nand were buried. Later Pterodactyls had no teeth, and were, perhaps,\r\nmilder in habits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Archæopteryx (the earliest known fossil bird), and\r\nCompsognathus (a small Dinosaur)]\r\nIt seems natural to pass from the fossil reptiles to the birds. But\r\nas a matter of fact the birds are not very closely related to the\r\nPterodactyls, and seem to have been descended from some other very\r\nspecial form of reptiles, so peculiar as to be considered a distinct\r\nclass. It may actually have been descended from those reptiles among\r\nthe Dinosaurs which walked on their hind legs and had only three toes\r\nto the foot. The first bird found belongs to Jurassic times; and its\r\nskeleton, found in some slate remains at Solenhofen in Bavaria, is\r\nnow to be seen in the Natural History Museum. There is another one\r\nin Berlin. This bird, called the _Archæopteryx_, was of the size of\r\na large pigeon, had a short head apparently without a beak, and its\r\njaws were armed with teeth. Whereas living birds have the fingers\r\nof their \"hands\" tied together in their wings, this bird has three\r\ndistinct fingers at the corner of its wings, each armed with a claw.\r\nIts legs were like those of living birds, and it had four toes. Its\r\ntail was unlike that of any living bird, and like that of a lizard.\r\nWhereas the bony part of the tail of living birds is very short and\r\nbears the tail feathers set across it fanwise, the _Archæopteryx_ had\r\na long bony tail made up of many bones, and the feathers were set in\r\na series one behind the other till the tail looked like the leaf of\r\na date palm in shape. Strange as this little creature appears it was\r\na genuine bird, for it had these feathers well developed, as the two\r\nfossil specimens showed. There are two sets of feathers forming the\r\nwings, and the thighs were also covered with feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE CHALK PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce again the European continent and with it Great Britain began\r\nto sink. Great Britain at the beginning of the era which followed\r\nthe Jurassic system, was joined to France, but south of this barrier\r\nwas a great fresh-water lake, into which rivers and streams poured\r\nfrom the north and the east. Great forests grew on its borders,\r\nforests still crowded with ferns and cycads as in previous ages,\r\nbut affording scope for pine trees to grow as well. On its borders\r\nflourished the giant _Iguanodon_, a great lizard-like animal which\r\ncould raise itself on its hind legs and lift a fifteen-foot body\r\nso as to feed on the branches of the trees. The _Iguanodon_ is a\r\nspecially interesting fossil reptile, because it was one of the\r\nfirst to be discovered. The first bones and teeth of the Iguanodon\r\nwere found seventy years ago by a celebrated and most delightful\r\nexplorer of the earth's crust, Dr. Gideon Mantell, in the strata\r\nknown as the Wealden, in Sussex, just below the chalk. Dr. Mantell\r\nwas only a country practitioner, and when he first produced before\r\nthe Geological Society his _Iguanodon_ remains, and suggested\r\nthat they were those of a reptile, some doubt was thrown on this\r\nconclusion, because geologists believed from the appearance of the\r\nteeth that the animal must be of some other animal family. But\r\nDr. Mantell found that a little lizard living in South America had\r\nteeth like those he had discovered in his reptile remains, and he\r\npersisted in his view. Many years later a wonderful find was made\r\nnear Brussels in a coal mine near Bernissart, the skeletons of no\r\nfewer than twenty-two huge _Iguanodons_ were found complete and\r\nembedded in a fairly soft clay-like rock. The authorities of the\r\nGovernment Museum took charge of the place and most carefully removed\r\nthe skeletons to Brussels, where the complete skeletons of seven\r\nwere with enormous difficulty and care removed bit by bit from the\r\nrock and set up as entire skeletons in the Brussels Museum, where\r\nthey may be seen. A replica of one of them is at South Kensington.\r\nThe fore feet of the _Iguanodon_ had five fingers, but the hind foot\r\nwas very much like that of a bird, and had only three toes, and the\r\nbones of the pelvis or hip girdle were extraordinarily like those of\r\na bird. When Professor Huxley examined the first fragments of the\r\n_Iguanodon's_ remains he was inclined to believe them to be those of\r\na gigantic bird; and it is generally believed now that it is from\r\nthis extraordinary reptile stock that the birds were derived.\r\n\r\nBut the great lake with all its varied stores was doomed to sink\r\nlower and lower, till the great sea overwhelmed England. Another\r\nocean joining it to the east overwhelmed Germany; and the whole of\r\nEurope, south of a line drawn through Scotland, Christiania, and\r\nMoscow, became sunk under salt water. There were patches standing up\r\nhere and there--Ireland, Brittany, Cornwall, Spain or a good part of\r\nit, Switzerland, part of Italy (and also part of what is now the\r\nWestern Mediterranean), and most of Turkey and Hungary. But elsewhere\r\nmarine animals succeeded the reptiles, and the foundations of all the\r\nchalk hills and cliffs of modern Europe were laid.\r\n\r\nOf what were they made? We may borrow a capital suggestion from\r\nMr. Jerome Harrison, of Birmingham University. \"Take,\" he says,\r\n\"a piece of chalk and brush it vigorously with a tooth-brush in a\r\nglass of water until the liquid looks quite milky. Allow the greater\r\npart of the sediment to subside, and then pour away the water and\r\nwash the material which has sunk to the bottom of the glass by\r\npouring water on it two or three times. Put the whitish powder which\r\nfinally remains under a microscope; and examine it with, say, the\r\nquarter-inch power, which will magnify about 300 diameters. The\r\ngreater part of the white powder will then be seen to be composed of\r\nthe minute shells of creatures called Foraminifera--little specks of\r\njelly-like matter which secrete for themselves a shell or covering\r\nfrom the carbonate of lime dissolved in the sea-water in which they\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n\"Countless millions of foraminifera inhabit the waters of the North\r\nAtlantic (and of other deep seas) at the present day; and of these at\r\nleast one species--_Globigerina bulloides_--cannot be distinguished\r\nfrom one of the commonest species found in the White Chalk. When\r\nthese tiny animals die their soft parts soon decay and disappear, and\r\ntheir skeletons (or shells) fall on the sea floor, where they form\r\na whitish mud or 'ooze.' The time required for the accumulation of\r\nso thick a deposit composed of the remains of organised beings--the\r\nWhite Chalk is in Norfolk quite 1200 feet thick--must have been very\r\ngreat. If we allow that the tiny shells of the foraminifera may\r\nhave accumulated at the rate of two feet in thickness in a century,\r\nthen it would have required 50,000 years to form the chalk of the\r\nsouth-east of England, whose thickness we have estimated at 1000\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one who has been on a chalk cliff or hill has found, and\r\nperhaps thrown, chalk flints. Flints are made of mineral called\r\nsilica, and very often these flints, or nodules of silica, surround\r\nsome organism like a sponge or a shell. During the formation of the\r\nchalk the sea floor appears to have been covered at intervals by a\r\ngrowth of sponges, which were composed of siliceous matter, and their\r\ndeath and decay produced most of the flint. Sometimes flint is found\r\nin bands, in which case it may have been deposited by siliceous water\r\ntrickling through fissures or cracks in the chalk.\r\n\r\nIn the sea which thus existed the Plesiosaurs and Ichthyosaurs still\r\npursued the even tenor of their way, growing larger and larger.\r\nThey were of many shapes, and probably of many habits. Some were\r\ncertainly fish-eaters, and with their enormous jaws must have been\r\nmost undesirable neighbours. Probably, however, they had plenty of\r\ndiversity in their lives, and may have had many a bitter struggle\r\nwith equally ferocious sea animals of other types. The scaly\r\nsaurians, for example, were beginning to come on; and began in\r\nthis era to assume the size and appearance that have occasionally\r\nsince been attributed to sea serpents. These reptiles, known as\r\n_Dolichosaurs_, were long-necked, lizard-like reptiles in the\r\nbeginning of their career, and grew longer and longer in succeeding\r\ngenerations, till at last their descendants were so long and snaky\r\nthat geologists have called the later specimens \"serpents.\" These sea\r\nserpents were from fifteen to forty-five feet in length, and their\r\nremains have been found in the valley of the Meuse. They do not seem\r\nto have had a very long career, for they do not appear after the\r\nChalk Age, and no direct descendants are known; but while they lived\r\nthey ranged from North and South America to Europe and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe first true sea turtles appeared and lived and extended their\r\nfamilies in great variety. They had broad flat forms, their shells\r\nonly just covering their ribs like a short Eton jacket; but they were\r\nvery large. The greatest of them, _Archelon_, had a skull larger than\r\nthat of a horse, and must have measured fully twelve feet across the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nWe may consider the birds at the same time as the sea animals or sea\r\nreptiles, since they, perhaps, were relations. Moreover, while the\r\nbirds of Jurassic times were land birds, those of the Chalk period\r\nwere aquatic. These birds belonged to two widely different classes,\r\none consisting of large birds which did not fly, the other of small\r\nbirds with great strength of wing and great powers of flight. Of the\r\nfirst kind was the _Hesperornis_. This was a large flightless bird,\r\nspecially adapted to diving. Its wings hardly existed, for they had\r\nonly one bone left; and that implies the passage of a very long\r\nflight of time, during which the wings once in existence had become\r\nmore and more useless, till they had dwindled to a mere nothing.\r\nBut the _Hesperornis_ had enormously strong legs, which were used\r\nas paddles, and their efficiency was increased by the bones of the\r\nfoot being so joined to the leg as to turn edgewise in the water\r\nwhen brought forward. Any one who has ever paddled a Canadian canoe\r\nwill appreciate the advantage of this. But this was not all, for\r\nthe legs were so joined to the body-frame as to stand out nearly\r\nat right angles (like a pair of oars), instead of standing under\r\nthe body as walking legs do. Apparently walking as well as flying\r\nhad been abandoned, and this bird had become a diver and swimmer\r\nmerely. The head, neck, and body were long, and admirably shaped for\r\nplunging through the water. Favoured by the powerful hind limbs,\r\nthe _Hesperornis_ must have been very swift both on and under the\r\nwater, and a formidable enemy to the fishes on which it preferred to\r\nfeed. Its jaws were armed with teeth set in a groove, and, like the\r\njaws of snakes, were separable so as to admit large prey. As these\r\nstrange birds were sometimes six feet long, they must have been able\r\nto account for fish and reptiles of considerable size. They probably\r\nlived nearly altogether on and in the water.\r\n\r\nThe second type of bird, _Ichthyornis_, were small birds, scarcely\r\nlarger than pigeons and a little like terns in appearance. They\r\nwere splendid fliers, and were armed with teeth set in sockets.\r\nTheir legs and feet were small and slender, but their wings very\r\nstrongly developed. They frequented the same seas and places as the\r\n_Hesperornis_, and yet the two were farther apart in structure than\r\nany two types of birds now living. Compared with the _Archæopteryx_,\r\nboth these types of birds show progress in the shortening of the\r\nlong, curiously feathered tail and the loss of the fingers and claws;\r\nbut both retained the teeth of primitive birds. We may perhaps be\r\nallowed to depart from the strict adherence to geologic chronology\r\nby tracing here, instead of in the next chapter, the subsequent\r\nhistory of the early birds. In the strata of the next era remains of\r\nvarious birds were found. One of great interest, on account of its\r\nenormous size, was the _Pharorachus_ of America. It was rather like,\r\nin type, a living bird known as the Cariama or Screamer. But if the\r\nextinct bird (of which the skull only has been found) had the general\r\nproportions and habits of the Cariama it must have been a terrible\r\nmonster, standing some twelve feet high, and far exceeding the most\r\npowerful eagles and vultures in strength and the size of its beak and\r\nclaws. Great extinct wingless birds are found in the quite recent\r\n\"alluvial\" deposits in New Zealand and Madagascar.\r\n\r\nSomething more than half a century ago a piece of bone was sent to\r\nSir Richard Owen by a visitor to New Zealand who had just arrived\r\nthere, and who had found it in his garden. Professor Owen, on\r\nexamination, was able to say, from the general make and structure of\r\nthe bone, that it was the bone of a bird. It was about seven or eight\r\ninches long. On examining the ridges and various marks on the bones,\r\nOwen was able to say that it was identical with the middle of the\r\nthigh-bone of an ostrich. He ventured then to publish that this bone\r\nwas a proof that there existed formerly in New Zealand a huge land\r\nbird like the ostrich, only bigger. After a few years more bones were\r\nsent to Owen from New Zealand, which entirely confirmed what he said;\r\nand in the course of a few years he was able to put together from\r\nthe bones sent a skeleton with enormous legs and neck--the skeleton\r\nof the ostrich-like bird the _Moa_ of New Zealand. Since that time a\r\ngreat number of these birds have been found buried in the morasses\r\nand swamps of that country. The _Moa_ is allied to the ostriches of\r\nAfrica, the emus and cassowaries of Australia, and the rheas of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe _Moa_ of Madagascar was smaller, and is known as the _Æpyornis_.\r\nBut it lays the largest egg known, a tremendous thing as big as\r\na Rugby football. It was this very large egg which inflamed the\r\nimagination of ancient navigators, and led to the vast exaggeration\r\nin describing the so-called \"Roc,\" which Sindbad met with in the\r\n_Arabian Nights_. In concluding these brief notes on extinct birds\r\nwe must also mention the present-day \"kiwi\" in New Zealand, which\r\nresembles in some respects the _Apteryx_, or most ancient of birds.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the land reptiles of the Chalk period. These are\r\nchiefly found in America, which was not submerged, as the greater\r\npart of Europe was, beneath the ocean. The incursion of the sea\r\nwas more limited in the western hemisphere, and the land area was\r\nlarge enough to allow the continued progress of the land reptiles,\r\nthough even here the sea reptiles seem to have done best. The great\r\nDinosaurs still kept in the forefront, but they were not quite so\r\npre-eminent as heretofore. The flesh-eating forms were less abundant,\r\nthough among them an enormous kangaroo-like reptile, fifteen feet\r\nlong, made its appearance. The _Dryptosaurus_ must have been speedy,\r\nvery powerful, and its habits must have made it appear like an ogre\r\nin seven-league boots to its smaller inoffensive neighbours. The\r\nSpoonbill Dinosaurs (_Hadrosaurus_) were very curious creatures, who\r\nalso faintly resembled a kangaroo, but had enormous lower parts and\r\ncrocodile-like tails.\r\n\r\nBut the most singular development appeared in the Ceratops family\r\nof the vegetarian reptiles, particularly in the genus called\r\n_Triceratops_. These were very large quadrupeds with enormous skulls\r\nwhich stretched back over the neck and shoulders in an enormous\r\ncape or hood of bone. Added to this was a sharp parrot-like beak, a\r\nstout horn on the nose, a pair of large pointed horns on the top of\r\nthe head, and a row of projections round the edge of the cape. The\r\n_Triceratops_ wanted all the protection it could get, for it had no\r\nintelligence worth mentioning. Professor Marsh remarks that they had\r\nthe largest heads and the smallest brains of the reptile race.\r\n\r\nThe heavy armour of the head of the _Triceratops_ must have been\r\ndeveloped for purposes of attack and defence, but we do not know\r\nwhether it was for fighting their own species or for protection\r\nagainst the carnivorous reptiles. \"So long,\" says Professor F.\r\nA. Lucas, \"as _Triceratops_ faced an adversary he must have been\r\npractically invulnerable, but, as he was the largest animal of his\r\ntime, it is probable that his combats were mainly with those of his\r\nown kind, and the subject of dispute some fair female upon whom rival\r\nsuitors had cast covetous eyes. What a sight it would have been to\r\nhave seen two of these big brutes in mortal combat, as they charged\r\nupon each other with all the impetus to be derived from ten tons\r\nof infuriate flesh! We may picture to ourselves horn clashing upon\r\nhorn, or glancing from each bony shield until some skilful stroke or\r\nunlucky slip placed one combatant at the mercy of his adversary....\r\n\r\n\"A pair of Triceratops's horns in the National Museum (at Washington)\r\nbears witness to such encounters, for one is broken midway between\r\ntip and base; and that it was broken during life is evident from the\r\nfact that the stump is healed and rounded over, while the size of the\r\nhorns shows that their owner reached a ripe old age.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with the concluding part of the last sentence it\r\nshould be mentioned that reptiles, like fishes, but unlike birds\r\nand mammals, continue to grow throughout their entire span of\r\nlife, so that unusually large bodily size is, at all events as a\r\nrule, an indication of advanced age. As regards general appearance\r\n_Triceratops_ may, perhaps, be best described as a reptilian\r\nrhinoceros, with the proviso that the tail was much larger and\r\nthicker than in that group of animals, and passed insensibly into the\r\nbody, as in reptiles generally, while the number and arrangement of\r\nthe horns were different.\r\n\r\nThe _Pterosaurs_, or flying reptiles, made, as we have said\r\nelsewhere, a great advance. Williston regards them as having come\r\nto excel all other flying vertebrate animals. Some attained a\r\nwing-spread of twenty feet, and they could fly far and fast. They\r\nwere all short-tailed; some of them probably could scarcely walk,\r\nand the larger of them had no teeth. Their bills resembled those\r\nof modern birds, and they have been styled the kingfishers of the\r\nCretaceous seas. Terrific to look upon, they were probably not very\r\ndeadly animals except to small fishes. The lizards did not make much\r\nprogress; but the snakes made their first appearance, though they\r\nremained small; and the mammals showed little progress from the forms\r\nwhich were found in the previous era of the Jurassic.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the geological period whose natural physiognomy\r\nwe have thus traced, Europe was still far from displaying the\r\nconfiguration which it now presents. A map of the period would\r\nrepresent the great basin of Paris (with the exception of a zone\r\nof Chalk), the whole of Switzerland, the greater part of Spain and\r\nItaly, the whole of Belgium, Holland, Prussia, Hungary, Wallachia,\r\nand Northern Russia as one vast sheet of water. A band of Jurassic\r\nrocks still connected France and England at Cherbourg--which\r\ndisappeared at a later period, and caused the separation of the\r\nBritish Islands from what is now France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF MAMMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Geological Record is not perfect. There are breaks in it such\r\nas have not and may never be filled up; and it is because of these\r\nbreaks that some of the divisions are made in geologic time. At\r\npresent the earth's crust has only been scratched for fossils.\r\nGreat parts of Asia and of Africa and of South America remain to be\r\nexplored, and they may in some future generation fill the gaps of\r\nour knowledge and render superfluous some of the divisions which\r\ngeologists now place in the eras of the rocks and of the fossils. But\r\nso far as we know at present there were real breaks in the history\r\nof the continents, perhaps not swift or sudden, but wholly changing\r\nthe appearance and the life, vegetable and animal, of half a world,\r\nperhaps the whole world at a time. Many geologists believe that the\r\nsecret of these changes lies in the core of the earth; and that, to\r\nuse our old simile of the golf ball, when the tension and pressures\r\ninside the earth grow too much for its strength something gives\r\nway, and the whole world begins to change, the continents sinking\r\nunder the oceans and new lands arising. We shall not again consider\r\nthis idea in all its bearings, or ask whether there is any simpler\r\nexplanation to be found in the never-ceasing explosive tremors of the\r\ncrust; but we shall only say that the last of these great changes\r\nset in at the end of the Chalk age. After that era we arrive at the\r\nperiod among the rocks which, with all its subdivisions, Eocene,\r\nMiocene, Pliocene, Quaternary, is classed as Cainozoic or Modern.\r\n\r\nLet us sum up the changes broadly. The Tertiary period, which now\r\nbegins, has been called the Age of Lakes: but this merely means\r\nthat there were great lake deposits, and it is true to say that as\r\ncontrasted with a period of great waters, the Tertiary is to be\r\nconsidered as the period of land. That does not mean that there\r\nwere in all the hundreds of thousands of years which it embraces no\r\nadvances and retreats of the sea, no submergings and uprisings of the\r\nland. There certainly were. But the land was dominant, and it is the\r\nland animals and the land vegetation that are the most important and\r\nprogress most. After the earth movements which occurred at the end\r\nof the Mesozoic or Secondary period there appears to have followed a\r\nperiod of quiet. There was a considerable area of land standing high\r\nabove the waters; and there began one of the minor but considerable\r\nencroachments of the sea in North America. It is probable that the\r\nPacific and the Atlantic joined between North and South America. At\r\nthe end of this first period the sea withdrew again, and what is\r\ncalled the Miocene period began with a lowering of the temperature of\r\nthe waters of the Atlantic; and lastly followed the great extension\r\nof the land towards the north, the great withdrawal of the sea of\r\nPliocene times, and the growing cold which led to the glacial era of\r\nthe Pleistocene period. In Europe and in Asia we may note that the\r\ngreat areas which are now covered by the Alps and the Himalayas were\r\nat the beginning of the Tertiary period still under water and only\r\na few signs (in the form of islands) of these mighty ranges were\r\nbeginning to appear.\r\n\r\nPre-eminently the age which comprises all these periods is the Age\r\nof Mammals. But one of the changes which European geologists first\r\nnoticed was the surprising change which took place in the marine\r\nfossils. The animals of the sea which were familiar during the\r\nChalk period nearly all disappeared and were replaced by new ones.\r\nThe great saurian reptiles, from the monsters of the land to the\r\nmososaurus serpents of the sea, disappeared, and most other reptiles\r\nshowed profound changes, showing a revolution in the animals of the\r\nland corresponding to that of the sea. Lastly, in this first period,\r\nthe Eocene, mammals suddenly appear in force and occupy the first\r\nplace among the animals. The vegetation did not change so much as\r\nmight have been expected.\r\n\r\nWhence came the mammals? That, again, is one of the questions which\r\ntime alone can completely answer. But the opinion of most geologists\r\nis that they arose and developed in Asia first of all, and then\r\nspread to other continents. The rise of the mammals, which, unlike\r\nthe reptiles, bring forth their young relatively mature and nourish\r\nand protect them, was contributing to the downfall of the reptiles,\r\nthough it cannot be considered an actual cause. The mammals' young\r\nhad a better chance of living and surviving than had the eggs of\r\nreptiles. Moreover, the mammals began with superior agility and\r\nhigher brain-power. It is not surprising, therefore, that the\r\ninvasion of the mammals resulted in the clumsy, affectionless,\r\nsmall-brained reptiles being driven either into extinction, or into\r\nthe sedges and rushes, the swamps and lagoons, the coverts of the\r\njungles, the crevices of the rocks, and the various by-ways which the\r\nmammals cared least to frequent, and that they have been kept there\r\nto this day.\r\n\r\nAt first the mammals were not very different in habit or type from\r\none another. Small animals, which, like the shrews, moles, and\r\nhedgehogs lived on insects were among the earliest. There were others\r\nwhose toes were turning to hoofs in order to fit them for fleetness;\r\nand there were some curious creatures called _Coryphodons_, which\r\nwere like the modern tapir, though they were tusked like boars. The\r\n_Coryphodon_ was a slow beast, with toes like those of an elephant,\r\nthough it was much smaller.\r\n\r\nIn America appeared a small animal not much bigger than a\r\nfox-terrier, which was the ancestor of the horse, and of which we\r\nshall have more to say. The birds increased, and forms like those\r\nof the heron mingled in the swamps with other goose-like birds that\r\nkept in their serrated bills some traces of the teeth of their early\r\nancestors. Others, like kingfishers, flitted over the streams; and\r\nthe emu, ostrich, and moa, as well as the albatross, find their\r\nearliest representatives in the Eocene times.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for us to follow, or even to enumerate, all the\r\nvaried ancestral lines which sprang up, some of them already\r\nvigorous, in the early Tertiary times, and which developed so\r\nmightily in the successive ages. We can only trace the careers of\r\na few such as are better and more popularly known, while admitting\r\nthat there are many others equally interesting from a scientific or\r\nfrom any other point of view. From a geologist's point of view the\r\nmost important, perhaps, of all the mammal developments was that of\r\nthe elephant. The first mammal which geologists discovered that was\r\nlike the elephant was the Mastodon, the American variety of which\r\nis called _Tetrabelodon_. But this Mastodon had no proper trunk as\r\nhas the elephant. Instead of that he had a very long upper lip which\r\napparently rested on his projecting upper tusks. Mr. Kipling once\r\nsuggested that the elephant's trunk was originally formed by an\r\naccident--an unfortunate young elephant before the days of trunks\r\nhaving stopped to drink at a pool, and his nose being seized by a\r\ncrocodile, who pulled and pulled till the nose lengthened out a\r\ntrunk. There certainly was some reason for the elephant's trunk,\r\nwhich has developed, we do not quite know how, from a long nose. But\r\na great deal has been found out about the early development of the\r\nelephant by Dr. Andrews of the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Evolution of the Head, Proboscis, Nostrils, and Tusks\r\nof the Elephant\r\n\r\nThe drawings are to the same scale; the nostrils indicated by the\r\nletter N, the upper lips by L, and the tusks by T.\r\n\r\n  1. Mœritherium of Eocene Libya, with a flexible upper lip and\r\n     the small incisor tusks.\r\n\r\n  2. Palæomastodon of Eocene Libya, with a short proboscis and\r\n     powerful upper and lower tusks.\r\n\r\n  3. Mammoth (Elephas Columbi) from the State of Indiana, with\r\n     gigantic upper tusks or ivories, and long proboscis with\r\n     nostrils at the tip.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDr. Andrews was travelling in Egypt some years ago, and joined a\r\nparty of officers of the great survey of Egypt in a visit to the\r\nGreat Western Desert, the rainless, sandy waste west of the Nile, not\r\nvery far from what is now called the Fayoum, and where in Roman days\r\nwas the great Lake Mœris, now dried up to a mere brine pool, in the\r\nsalt water of which the fresh-water fishes of the Nile still live.\r\nThe surveying party intended to determine the geological age of these\r\nsands, which stretch for hundreds of miles, often rising into cliffs\r\nwhich are cut sharp by the wind and show horizontal stratification.\r\nThe geologists determined that the sands of this region were of\r\nEocene and Miocene Age, and from them Dr. Andrews brought home\r\nsome very interesting bones. These included the remains of a more\r\nprimitive Mastodon than any as yet known, and of an animal which he\r\ncalled Meritherium, which is a connecting link between elephants\r\nand other mammals. The collection included also remains of great\r\nflesh-eating beasts, and of sea cows, of tortoises, and of a snake\r\nsixty feet long!\r\n\r\nHowever, in regard to the history of elephants, the upshot of Dr.\r\nAndrews' most important discoveries is that we find living here in\r\nthe Upper Eocene period (which is older than the age in which the\r\n_Tetrabelodon Mastodon_ was found) an elephant ancestor of the kind\r\nto which Dr. Andrews gave the name of _Palæomastodon_ or \"ancient\r\nmastodon.\" We thus arrive at an ancestral elephant-like creature\r\nwhich serves to join the elephant stock on to more ordinary mammals.\r\nThis beast was not so very big, perhaps about the same size as an\r\nordinary cart-horse.\r\n\r\nDr. Andrews' further triumph was the additional discovery of the\r\nrather smaller animal which he called the _Meritherium_, and which\r\nwas undoubtedly an elephant of sorts, though at first sight it has no\r\nresemblance to one, and probably had no trunk at all. It certainly\r\nhad no big tusks; but its teeth make us certain that it belonged\r\nto the elephant family. \"Here, then,\" says Sir E. Ray Lankester,\r\n\"we have arrived at a form which undoubtedly was closely related\r\nto the ancestors of all the elephants, if not actually itself that\r\nancestor, and in it we see the origin of the elephants peculiar\r\nstructure. From this comparatively normal pig-like _Meritherium_, the\r\nwonderful elephant, with his upright face, his dependent trunk, and\r\nhis huge spreading tusks has been gradually, step by step, produced.\r\nAnd we have seen some, at least, of the intermediate steps--the\r\nlengthening of the jaws and the increase in the size of the teeth in\r\nthe _Palæomastodon_--carried still further on by the _Tetrabelodon_,\r\nand then followed by a shrinkage of the lower jaw and final evolution\r\nof the middle part of the face and upper jaw into the drooping,\r\nwonderful, prehensile trunk.\"\r\n\r\nThe long-chinned elephant requires, however, a few moments'\r\nconsideration from an altogether different point of view. This\r\nspecies appears to have had the widest geographical distribution of\r\nany member of the family, of which it may be regarded as the great\r\ncolonising or emigrant representative. First developed in North\r\nAfrica, where its remains occur in the early Miocene strata of Mogara\r\nand Tunisia, this species ranged right across Europe to the confines\r\nof North-Western India, having probably reached Italy from Africa\r\nby means of a land-bridge by way of Sicily, and thence travelling\r\nthrough Greece into Asia. On the latter continent it appears to have\r\ngiven rise to the modern elephants, as remains of the former are\r\nunknown in any other part of the world.\r\n\r\nIf this be true, it follows that elephants of the modern type\r\nsubsequently migrated into Europe and thence to Africa, while in the\r\nother direction they wandered by way of Behring Strait to America.\r\nHence we are led to the remarkable conclusion that while the first\r\nelephants appeared in Africa, the modern African elephant is of\r\nAsiatic parentage, and a comparatively recent immigrant into the\r\nland of its forefathers. Next to man and the carnivora, elephants\r\nappear to have been the greatest travellers the world has ever\r\nproduced, for, starting from their North African birthplace, they\r\nreached by the Behring Strait route nearly to the extremity of South\r\nAmerica, while to the north they penetrated the Arctic circle, and\r\nto the south, on their return journey, reached the coast in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cape Town.\r\n\r\nAnother great traveller was the horse. The first undoubted\r\nhorse-like animal was _Eohippus_, a little creature about eleven\r\ninches in height at the shoulder, and in general rather more like\r\nthe flesh-eaters than the horses of the present day. The back was\r\narched, the head and neck were short, and the limbs of moderate\r\nlength, showing no remarkable adaptation for speed. This genus had\r\na remarkable range, having apparently originated in England (then\r\na part of Western Europe), and migrated by way of Europe and Asia,\r\nand what is now Behring Strait, to America, where it got as far east\r\nas New Mexico. This migration of _Eohippus_ shifted the scene of\r\nevolution to the western hemisphere, for while examples of it are\r\ncontinually and continuously found there in succeeding strata it only\r\nappears occasionally in Europe, as if the remains there had been\r\nthose of mere emigrants.\r\n\r\nLater on the horse developed in America, growing larger till it was\r\nfirst as big as a collie-dog, with signs of being more adapted for\r\nspeed. It then had four toes on its foot. It continued, though very\r\ngradually, to grow larger, and even more gradually its unnecessary\r\ntoes grew fewer and fewer till at last they disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt length appeared the horse which had only one toe. This type,\r\nthat of the modern horse, first becomes known in the Upper Pliocene\r\nbeds of Europe, and represents the culmination of the race. The\r\ncompleteness of the record of the evolution of the horse tells us\r\nsomething of the enormous numbers of ancestral forms which must\r\nhave existed in the more than two million years that have elapsed\r\nsince the first diminutive horse appeared in North America. While\r\nnot strongly given to migration, in the course of time these\r\nanimals wandered over the entire world, with the exception of such\r\ninaccessible places as Australia and the Oceanic Islands.... It\r\nwould seem that the original stock was of Eurasian derivation, though\r\nthe great theatre of the evolutionary drama was soon transferred\r\nto North America, the Eurasian, African, and South American horses\r\nwhich appear from time to time being in all probability of North\r\nAmerican origin. The ultimate fate of the horses in both North and\r\nSouth America was extinction, all wild horses of our own time,\r\nincluding the asses and zebras, being confined to Asia and Africa.\r\nThe apparently wild bands of the American western plains, and those\r\nwhich roam over the pampas of South America, are the descendants of\r\ndomestic horses that have escaped from human bondage, largely from\r\nthe early Spanish explorers.\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceroses of to-day, the one-horned Indian variety and the\r\ntwo-horned African rhinoceros, were preceded by a whole regiment of\r\nrhinoceroses in the Tertiary period. One such was dug out in Fleet\r\nStreet during the excavation for the _Daily Chronicle_ office.\r\nThis rhinoceros had a hairy coat like the Mammoth which lived much\r\nlater, and in Siberia is found sometimes side by side with the later\r\nquadruped. Many of the extinct rhinoceroses had two horns like the\r\nAfrican square-mouthed rhinoceros, which is sometimes misleadingly\r\ncalled the white rhinoceros. One great extinct beast, the\r\n_Elasmotherium_, allied to them, had a great horn carried on a huge\r\nboss in the middle of its head instead of on the nose, while another\r\nstill huger animal called the _Titanotherium_ and found in North\r\nAmerica had a pair of horns perched on either side of its nose. As\r\nlarge as the rhinoceros but having a very different arrangement of\r\nthe bones of its ankles and wrists and very different teeth and horns\r\nare the extraordinary creatures known as _Dinoceras_, whole skeletons\r\nof which have been disinterred from the Eocene strata of Wyoming\r\nin the United States by Professor Marsh. These creatures had three\r\npairs of horns on the top of the head and a pair of great tusks as\r\nwell. Nearly all these animals, though they were more brainy than the\r\nreptiles, had much smaller brains in proportion to their size than\r\nthe bulk of the animals which now roam the earth, from which we may\r\nsurmise that though a small brain suffices to guide a great animal\r\nmachine in established ways, yet in order to learn new things in its\r\nlifetime an animal must have a big brain.\r\n\r\nThe last great mammal we must mention in this series is the\r\n_Arsinoitherium_, which was found only a few years ago by Dr.\r\nAndrews in Egypt, in the same strata whence he obtained the fossil\r\nancestors of the elephant. It was so called because it was found\r\nnear the palace of Arsinoë, the name of the Egyptian queen of Greek\r\nrace. But _Arsinoitherium_ was far from being a graceful ladylike\r\ncreature, and, resembling in general appearance a rhinoceros, had two\r\nenormous bones, which grew out of its nose on either side of it. The\r\nbones were hollow and were probably covered with skin in life; and\r\n_Arsinoitherium_ had a wonderful and wonderfully even set of teeth.\r\nTo conclude, we must add a representative mammal of this period, the\r\n_Sivatherium_, found in India, and the _Samotherium_, found in the\r\nIsle of Samos, which were like giraffes, and the beginning of the\r\nsloth-like animals, whose appearance we must, however, deal with in\r\nanother chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two Arsinoitheriums (Prehistoric Rhinoceros) at Bay\r\nbefore a Pack of Hyænodons\r\n\r\nThe Arsinoitherium stood 5 feet 9 inches at the withers, and measured\r\n9 feet 9 inches from snout to rump. The hyænodons (hyæna toothed)\r\nwere no relation of the modern hyæna. They had bodies like the\r\nTasmanian wolf, and were wonderfully adapted to capture both land and\r\nwater living prey.\r\n\r\n(Drawn under the direction of Prof. Osborn.)]\r\nThe whales whose remains are found in the Pliocene rocks differ\r\nlittle from those now living; but the observations geologists have\r\nbeen able to make upon these gigantic remains of the ancient world\r\nare too few to allow of any very precise conclusion. It is certain,\r\nhowever, that the fossil differs from the existing whale in certain\r\ncharacteristics perceptible in the bones of the skull. The discovery\r\nof an enormous fragment of a fossil whale, made at Paris in 1779,\r\nin the cellar of a wine merchant in the Rue Dauphine, created a\r\ngreat sensation. Science pronounced, without much hesitation, on the\r\ntrue origin of these remains; but the public had some difficulty in\r\ncomprehending the existence of a whale in the Rue Dauphine. It was in\r\ndigging some holes in his cellars that the wine merchant made this\r\ninteresting discovery. His workmen found, under the pick, an enormous\r\npiece of bone buried in a yellow clay. Its complete extraction\r\ncaused him a great deal of labour, and presented many difficulties.\r\nLittle interested in making further discoveries, our wine merchant\r\ncontented himself with raising, with the help of a chisel, a portion\r\nof the monstrous bone. The piece thus detached weighed 227 lbs. It\r\nwas exhibited in the wine-shop, where large numbers of the curious\r\nwent to see it. Lamanon, a naturalist of that day, who examined it,\r\nconjectured that the bone belonged to the head of a whale. As to the\r\nbone itself, it was purchased for the Teyler Museum, at Haarlem.\r\n\r\nLastly, we must not omit to mention that in the Old World the first\r\ntrue apes, _Oreopithecus_ and _Dryopithecus_, appeared. The first\r\nof these united some of the characteristics of apes and monkeys;\r\nthe second, about the same size, was more closely related to the\r\nchimpanzee and gorilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE ICE AGE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason or reasons concerning which there has been a great\r\ndeal of speculation but not a large amount of agreement, the closing\r\nstages of the last geologic era which precedes our own and which\r\nlinks the great past to the present, were distinguished by great cold\r\nand by widespread fields of ice. Ice-sheets spread over six or eight\r\nmillion square miles of the earth's surface where not long before\r\nmild climates had prevailed. Were it not for this great Ice Age and\r\nfor its far-reaching effects on the conditions under which Man has\r\ndeveloped, this period, which is sometimes called the Pleistocene,\r\n(from Greek words meaning the \"most recent\"), would be more properly\r\njoined to the era which we have just been discussing, the two\r\nperiods constituting a single period of great land elevation and of\r\nocean-shrinking. This period, however, is now thought to be much more\r\nimportant than it was formerly, and perhaps longer in duration.\r\n\r\nMore than half the ice-covered land lay in North America and more\r\nthan half the rest in Europe. The glaciation, therefore, was probably\r\nconfined to certain parts of the world and did not stretch all over\r\nthe planet. But the whole world felt its effects; even in tropical\r\nregions ice and glaciers occurred on mountains where they did not\r\nexist before and do not exist now, and on mountains which now have\r\nglaciers the ice descended to levels 5000 feet below the point where\r\nit now stops. The southern hemisphere was affected as well as the\r\nnorthern, but to a much less degree. In Patagonia and New Zealand\r\nglaciers crept down from the mountains and spread out on the plains.\r\nGlaciers formed on the mountainous tracts of Tasmania and Australia\r\nwhere none exist now. Most of the higher mountains of the southern\r\nhemisphere bore glaciers. The Antarctic regions were presumably\r\nburied beneath ice and snow as they are at present, but of that we\r\nare not certain.\r\n\r\nIn Asia ice-fields far greater than those existing to-day affected\r\nthe higher mountains, and from the Lebanon to the Caucasus and from\r\nthe Himalayas to Siberia and China traces of glaciers are found where\r\nthey are not to be seen now. Yet on the plateaux and lowlands of\r\nAsia ice-sheets were far less extensive than in Europe and in North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIn Europe there were large glaciers in the southern mountains and\r\nextensive ice-sheets on the southern plains. Radiating from the\r\nScandinavian highlands a succession of great ice-sheets crept forth\r\non the lowlands of Russia, Germany, Denmark, Holland, and Belgium,\r\nand crossing the shallow basin of the North Sea touched the shores\r\nof Great Britain, where they were met by ice radiating from the\r\nmountains of these isles.\r\n\r\nFrom the Alps gigantic glaciers descended to the lowlands in all\r\ndirections. Then the Rhine glacier moved out far beyond the mountains\r\nand joined with the glaciers of Savoy and Dauphiny on the plains of\r\nFrance, while from the Southern Alps glaciers invaded the fertile\r\nplains of Italy.\r\n\r\nGlaciers of similar size and extent descended into the valleys of\r\nthe Rhine and Danube. The Pyrenees, some of the higher mountains of\r\nthe Spanish plateau, the higher mountains of France, the Apennines,\r\nthe Carpathians, the Balkans, the Urals, all had their ice-sheets.\r\nIceland and the Faroe Islands were buried under ice, and even Corsica\r\nhad snowfields and glaciers, some of which were not small.\r\n\r\nNearly one half of North America was buried in ice. Strangely enough,\r\nit was not the whole northern half, but the north-eastern half that\r\nwas specially ice-invaded, and, more strangely still, not so much\r\nthe mountainous portions, though these were affected, as the plains.\r\nAlaska was largely free from ice except on or about the mountains:\r\nand there was less ice on the western plains than in the valley of\r\nthe Mississippi. Much the greater part of the four million square\r\nmiles of ice-field lay on the plains of Canada and in the upper\r\nMississippi valley. The Missouri and Ohio rivers like two great arms\r\nembraced the borders of the ice-fields to which they owe their origin.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to examine the several theories which have been\r\nproposed to account for this extraordinary cold, for none is\r\ncompletely acceptable or accepted, but we may just mention them. Dr.\r\nCroll a century ago suggested that the cold may have been due to\r\nthe alterations in the shape of the earth's orbit, alterations which\r\nastronomers tell us take place regularly, though very slowly and at\r\nintervals of millions of years. If so, this glacial period was only\r\nthe last of many glacial periods; the traces of the earlier ones\r\nhaving, however, been for the most part obliterated and destroyed.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell has urged that geographical changes (elevations\r\nand subsidences) would of themselves be sufficient to bring about\r\na glacial period, which (he says) would be the result of a great\r\ncontinent being formed round the North Pole while oceanic conditions\r\nprevailed at the Equator. Another theory is that the heat given out\r\nby the sun is not always equal, being sometimes more (when even polar\r\ncountries enjoy a warm climate) and sometimes less (when only the\r\nequatorial regions are habitable). The objection to this theory is,\r\nof course, that we have no proof that our sun is of greatly variable\r\nheat. Whatever may have been the cause of the glacial period, we know\r\nas a proved fact that a long time ago (as measured by years, although\r\nthe event itself is among the latest of the many changes recorded\r\nin the geological history of the earth) the climate of the British\r\nIsles was so intensely cold that the greater part of this country was\r\ncovered with ice and snow, and we know also that this intense cold\r\nwas sufficient to change in many respects the habits and appearance\r\nof the animals and vegetation of the earth. How much this was the\r\ncase can be gathered from the fact that in the period which preceded\r\nit animals which now live in the tropics roamed in the Arctic circle,\r\nand figs and magnolias grew in Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe last word we shall have to say on the climatic conditions of\r\nthis period is that the Ice Age had its sub-periods and divisions\r\nlike all other epochs and in them the ice sometimes retreated, and\r\nconsequently in parts of the earth where there had been snow and ice,\r\nand where there were to be ice and snow again, the wintry conditions\r\nretreated (for centuries, perhaps, at a time), and the valleys and\r\nplains basked during these intervals in sun and rain and warmth.\r\nThese epochs are called \"inter-glacial epochs.\"\r\n\r\nThe life of the regions not much affected by the rigours of snow and\r\nice is gradually being ascertained by geologists now. One of its most\r\nmarked features was the retreat of the northern and Asiatic animals\r\nbefore the advancing ice towards the warmer tropics and Equator;\r\nthese animals journeyed back northward again whenever the retreating\r\nice would let them. The great _Proboscideans_, the Mastodon and the\r\nMammoth were members of this group, and so were the bear, the bison,\r\nthe musk ox. With these mingled towards the south several types\r\n(which were gradually becoming extinct in North America) such as the\r\nhorse, tapir, llama, and the sabre-tooth cat. A second prominent\r\nfeature was a southern group in the western hemisphere, consisting of\r\ngigantic sloths, armadillos, and water-hogs; and now for the first\r\ntime the interest of animal life shifts to South America.\r\n\r\n\"There are many instances,\" says Sir Edward Ray Lankester in his\r\nbook on _Extinct Animals_, \"in which small living animals were\r\nrepresented in the past by gigantic forms very close in structure\r\nto the little living beasts, but of much greater size. Hence it is\r\nconcluded that these particular living animals are the reduced and\r\ndwindled representatives of a race of primeval monsters. There is\r\nsome truth in this, as may be seen from the history of the living\r\nsloths and armadillos of South America, as compared with the extinct\r\ngigantic sloths and armadillos dug up in that country. But it is a\r\ngreat mistake to conclude from this that it is a law of nature that\r\nrecent animals are all small and insignificant as compared with\r\ntheir representatives in the past. That is simply not true. Recent\r\nhorses are bigger than extinct ones; recent elephants are much bigger\r\nthan their earlier elephantine ancestors. There never has been\r\nany creature of any kind--mammal, reptile, bird, or fish--in any\r\ngeological period we know of, so big as some of the existing whales,\r\nthe Sperm Whale, the great Rorqual, and the whalebone whales.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that there were enormous reptiles in the past, far larger\r\nthan any living crocodiles, standing fourteen feet at the loins, and\r\nmeasuring eighty feet from the tip of the snout to the end of the\r\ntail; but their bodies did not weigh much more than a big African\r\nelephant, and were small compared with whales. So let us be under no\r\nillusions as to extinct monsters, and proceed to look at those of\r\nSouth America with simple courage and confidence in our own day.\"\r\n\r\nThe peculiar productions of South America in the way of animals\r\nappear to be the members of the group of mammals called _Edentata_\r\nfound nowhere else. When, however, South America, which once was an\r\nisland, joined on to North America, numbers of animals, mastodons,\r\nhorses, tigers, and tapirs, emigrated from north to south, and\r\nperhaps proved too much for the aboriginal or native beasts. At any\r\nrate, all the big South American mammals died out, and now there\r\nare left only the small tree sloths, the small armadillos, and the\r\nstrange-looking ant-eaters. But in quite late geological deposits\r\nof South America we find the bones of gigantic armadillos and of\r\ngigantic ground sloths, which lasted on till the time when man\r\nappeared on the scene.\r\n\r\nThe _Glyptodon_, of which there were several different kinds, was an\r\nenormous armadillo as big as an ox. Like their small, puny, modern\r\ndescendants, they carried on their backs a hard case of bones,\r\nsomething like the shell of a tortoise. The modern armadillo's shell,\r\nhowever, is jointed so that the little animal can roll itself up into\r\na ball, and in this direction, therefore, the armadillo, though it\r\nhas decreased so much in size, has advanced in adaptability.\r\n\r\nThe _Megatherium_ was nearly as big as an elephant, and its skeleton,\r\nthough so much larger, is very similar to those of the small sloths\r\nof present-day South America. Its teeth also are very much like\r\ntheirs. But whereas the living sloths climb trees, as they have\r\nlearnt to do, the _Megatherium's_ method was more primitive though\r\nquite as effective. It stood on the ground and pulled the trees down\r\nin order to eat the young branches. The _Mylodon_, which lived at\r\nthe same time, was not so big, and its habits were similar. It had\r\na number of little bony pieces scattered in its skin in the region\r\nof the back, like the pieces forming the bony case of the ancient\r\narmadillos; but the pieces in this case were not closely fitted\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that the _Mylodon_, like all the peculiar gigantic\r\nanimals of South America, had become extinct as long ago as the\r\nMammoth (of which we shall say more presently) or of the woolly\r\nrhinoceros which used to haunt Fleet Street. All these extinct South\r\nAmerican animals were distinguished by peculiarly shaped teeth, and\r\nhad no teeth at all in front. They are called, therefore, _Edentata_,\r\nand their representatives to-day are much smaller.\r\n\r\nBut some years ago Dr. Nordenskjold, a Scandinavian traveller, while\r\nexploring in Patagonia, found a vast cavern called the _Ultima\r\nSperanza_ cave, on the western coast. From this cavern the settlers\r\nwho lived close by had removed an enormous piece of skin covered with\r\ngreenish-brown hair, and studded on its inner side with little knobs\r\nof bone. The skin was dry but sound. When it was placed in water it\r\ngave out a smell which, though unpleasant, was very interesting, for\r\nit showed that the animal which had worn it could not have been dead\r\nthousands or even many hundreds of years. It was, in fact, evidently\r\na piece of the skin of a _Mylodon_, which had survived in this region\r\nuntil modern times.\r\n\r\nFurther explorations were made in the cavern by Dr. Moreno, of La\r\nPlata, and other naturalists, and an immense quantity of bones was\r\nobtained, and more portions of the skin of _Mylodon_ with the hair\r\non. The cavern had been inhabited probably several centuries ago by\r\nIndians, for human bones and weapons were obtained.\r\n\r\nThe remains of as many as twenty _Mylodons_ have been obtained from\r\nthe cavern, and many of the bones are cut or broken in a way which\r\nleads us to suspect that the human inhabitants of the cave cut up the\r\ndead _Mylodons_ for food, and split their bones to obtain the marrow!\r\n\r\nSome of the _Mylodon_ bones, skulls, jaw-bones, leg-bones, etc., are\r\nsmeared with blood and have pieces of cartilage and tendon attached.\r\nThere are other evidences which go to show that the Indians may have\r\nkept the _Mylodons_ alive in the cave and fed them with hay brought\r\nfrom the outside. Anybody who would care to see the last of the great\r\nextinct animals can inspect some of these remains at the museum in\r\nCromwell Road, London.\r\n\r\nBesides the relics of the _Mylodon_ and of Man the cavern has yielded\r\nbones and teeth, and many horny hoofs belonging to a kind of extinct\r\nhorses; and this constitutes one of the puzzling things about this\r\ncave treasure. The cave is in a part of the country very difficult\r\nto reach, and though Sir Thomas Holdich and Mr. Hesketh Prichard\r\nmade efforts to reach it again and explore it systematically and\r\nscientifically, there is a great deal about it that seems likely to\r\nremain unexplained.\r\n\r\nThe bones that were found are not buried in lime or any preserving\r\nstone; but lie in sand where one would expect them to have perished\r\nlong ago if they had been of any great age. Yet side by side with\r\nthem are the bones of a long-extinct horse; and there is no tradition\r\namong the Indians to-day of any huge beast corresponding to the\r\n_Mylodon_. Sir E. Ray Lankester has pointed out that the whole of\r\nSouth America has been submerged and has risen (and is rising still)\r\nfor many centuries. Possibly the rocks and high lands where the\r\n_Mylodon_ cavern occurs formed an island during the submergence,\r\nwhere a number of early animals took refuge and survived until the\r\nre-elevation of the land--and so lived on in the present condition of\r\nthe land surface until fifty or a hundred years ago. The great land\r\ntortoises (like the Galapagan[17] tortoise) have similarly survived\r\non a few equatorial islands. Possibly, though it does not seem very\r\nlikely, the _Mylodon_ is still living in similar caverns in this\r\nregion, as yet unvisited by man.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Of the Galapagos Islands.]\r\n\r\nIn Australia, the land of the marsupials or mammals with pouches,\r\nthe bones of many gigantic creatures belonging to that tribe of\r\nanimal have been found. Giant kangaroos, twice as tall as the biggest\r\nliving kangaroo, wombats and voles as big as a rhinoceros, have been\r\ndiscovered. One of these is the _Diprotodon_, which Sir Richard Owen\r\nreconstructed much in the same way that he reconstructed the _Moa_,\r\nand of which Dr. Stirling has since found complete specimens in a\r\nmorass in South Australia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diprotodon\r\n\r\nEqual in size to a large rhinoceros. (Remains found in Australia.)]\r\nLast of all of the great extinct mammals which we shall mention\r\nis the Mammoth, which has a peculiar interest because, like the\r\n_Mylodon_, it certainly survived until man was on the earth, as there\r\nare many more evidences to prove.\r\n\r\nIn one of the caves of France inhabited by prehistoric men and\r\nthickly strewn with the chipped flints which they used as tools and\r\nweapons, as well as with the bones of extinct animals which they\r\nate, a piece of Mammoth's tusk has been found on which is rudely but\r\ncleverly carved, evidently by the men who lived there, the picture of\r\na Mammoth. (There are besides, antlers on which a reindeer is very\r\ncleverly and artistically outlined. Even the tuft of hair below the\r\nchin is shown, and the great feet and the extra toes are correctly\r\npictured. Clearly the men who drew this reindeer lived with the\r\nreindeer; and besides the reindeer, living near these men in the\r\nsouth of France, was the great Mammoth.)\r\n\r\nThe Mammoth was like an Indian elephant, but with a coarse hairy\r\npelt. It was rather bigger than the big Indian elephant, and its\r\ntusks had a different curvature; but we may dispose of the popular\r\nidea that it was bigger than any elephant. No Siberian Mammoth has\r\nyet been found higher at the shoulders than nine feet six inches,\r\nwhereas the African elephant stands eleven feet and sometimes more\r\nat the shoulders. Among the fossil elephants of Southern Europe and\r\nof North America (_Elephas imperator_) there are two which stood from\r\ntwelve to thirteen feet high. The remains of the Mammoth are left all\r\nover the north of Europe and Asia and of the countries which were\r\nsubjected to glacial influences. Even in England its teeth and tusks\r\nare constantly found, and in the Natural History Museum there is a\r\nwhole skull with enormous tusks, which was dug up in a brickfield\r\nat Ilford. Probably this animal continued to exist longer in Asia\r\nand Siberia than in our own part of the world: and the cold and ice\r\npreserved their remains so well that whole carcases have been dug up.\r\n\r\nOne such instance is historic. In 1799 a native chief near Lake\r\nOnkoul, in Siberia, while seeking for Mammoth teeth, perceived a\r\ngreat shapeless mass among the ice. He watched it for some years,\r\ntill at the end of the fifth year the ice melted and disclosed the\r\ncarcase of a whole Mammoth.\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, 1804, Schumakhoff cut off the horns (the\r\ntusks), which he exchanged with the merchant Bultunof for goods of\r\nthe value of fifty roubles (not quite eight pounds sterling). It was\r\nnot till two years after this that Mr. Adams, of the St. Petersburg\r\nAcademy, who was travelling with Count Golovkin, sent by the Czar of\r\nRussia on an embassy to China, having been told at Yakutsk of the\r\ndiscovery of an animal of extraordinary magnitude on the shores of\r\nthe Frozen Ocean, near the mouth of the River Lena, betook himself\r\nto the place. He found the Mammoth still in the same place, but very\r\nmuch mutilated. The Yakuts of the neighbourhood had cut off the\r\nflesh, with which they fed their dogs; wild beasts, such as white\r\nbears, wolves, wolverenes, and foxes, had also fed upon it, and\r\ntraces of their footsteps were seen around. The skeleton, almost\r\nentirely cleared of its flesh, remained whole, with the exception of\r\none foreleg. The spine of the back, one scapula, the pelvis, and the\r\nother three limbs were still held together by the ligaments and by\r\nparts of the skin; the other scapula was found not far off. The head\r\nwas covered with a dry skin; one of the ears was furnished with a\r\ntuft of hairs; the balls of the eyes were still distinguishable; the\r\nbrain still occupied the cranium, but seemed dried up; the point of\r\nthe lower lip had been gnawed and the upper lip had been destroyed so\r\nas to expose the teeth; the neck was furnished with a long flowing\r\nmane; the skin, of a dark-grey colour, covered with black hairs and a\r\nreddish wool, was so heavy that ten persons found great difficulty in\r\ntransporting it to the shore.\r\n\r\nThere was collected, according to Mr. Adams, more than thirty-six\r\npounds weight of hair and wool which the white bears had trod into\r\nthe ground while devouring the flesh. This Mammoth was a male, so\r\nfat and well fed, according to the assertion of the Tungusian chief,\r\nthat its belly hung down below the joints of its knees. Its tusks\r\nwere nine feet six inches in length, measured along the curve, and\r\nits head without the tusks weighed four hundred and fourteen pounds\r\navoirdupois. Mr. Adams took every care to collect all that remained\r\nof this unique specimen of an ancient creation, and forwarded the\r\nparts to St. Petersburg, a distance of 11,000 versts (7330 miles).\r\nHe succeeded in repurchasing what he believed to be the tusks at\r\nYakutsk, and the Emperor of Russia, who became the owner of this\r\nprecious relic, paid him 8000 roubles.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton is deposited in the museum of the Academy of St.\r\nPetersburg, and the skin still remains attached to the head and the\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nA very curious example of the Siberian Mammoth was discovered only a\r\nfew years ago by a Lamut of one of the Arctic villages, and through\r\nthe energy of Dr. Herz was eventually removed in pieces to St.\r\nPetersburg. In the Zoological Museum there the reconstructed Mammoth\r\nnow crawls out of a huge pit, for it was by falling into a pit that\r\nthis fine beast met his death hundreds of generations ago. It was\r\nsunk in frozen ground, and this cold-storage treatment had preserved\r\nit in an extraordinary manner. If the Siberian natives who discovered\r\nit partially buried in alluvial deposit had not uncovered it, so that\r\nthe sun was able to play on the carcase and produced decay, this\r\nwonderful primeval monster might almost have been got out whole. As\r\nit was the frozen ground had so kept the remains that Dr. Herz found\r\nwell-preserved fragments of food between the teeth, and the remains\r\nof a hearty meal in the stomach. There is no doubt that the Mammoth\r\nfell into the crevice or pit and damaged himself so much in the fall\r\nthat he could not crawl out. One cannot help feeling some relief that\r\nhe died after a short death-struggle. A good deal of the very old\r\nmeat of this body was eagerly eaten by the native dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE KINGDOM OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest zoologist of his time, Sir E. Ray Lankester, has said\r\nthat man has differed from all other inhabitants of the animal\r\nkingdom in being able to resist the pressure of circumstances which\r\nhave altered and destroyed them. In all the cases of the animals\r\nwhich we have been considering, these creatures have been limited by\r\nthe conditions of geography; they have been killed by extremes of\r\nheat and cold; they have been subject to starvation if one kind of\r\ndiet were unobtainable; and they have constantly altered in shape,\r\nstructure, and appearance, according to the requirements of the new\r\nconditions in which they found themselves. But man's mind and will\r\nhave enabled him to cross rivers and oceans by rafts and boats, to\r\nclothe himself against cold, to shelter himself from heat and rain,\r\nto prepare an endless variety of food by fire, and to increase and\r\nmultiply as no other animal without change of form, and without\r\nsubmitting to the terrible axe of selection wielded by ruthless\r\ncircumstance over all other living things on this globe. \"And as\r\nhe has more and more obtained this control over his surroundings,\r\nhe has expanded that unconscious protective attitude towards his\r\nmature offspring which natural selection had already favoured and\r\nestablished among the mammals into a conscious and larger love for\r\nhis tribe, his race, his nationality, and his kind. He has developed\r\nspeech, the power of communicating, and, above all, of recording from\r\ngeneration to generation his thought and knowledge. He has formed\r\ncommunities, built cities, and set up empires; and at every step of\r\nhis progress man has receded farther and farther from the ancient\r\nrule exercised by nature over the lower animals.\"\r\n\r\nWhence comes this power? When and how did it arrive? That we do not\r\nknow. For the early beginnings of man we can only grope among the\r\nrelics of his progress which he has left for the speculation of his\r\nmore intelligent descendants, in the shape of the rude implements and\r\ndwellings which he used in the childhood of the race.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time actual remains of early man are found buried\r\namong the uppermost strata, and from them we can make some guesses\r\nat his age. Virtually three links have been found in the chain of\r\nhuman ancestry. The earliest is represented by the \"Trinil Man\"\r\nof Java, found by Dubois in 1890, and named the _Pithecanthropos\r\nerectus_, in reference to its likeness both to man as we know him\r\nand to the great anthropoid apes, although it had a much more erect\r\ncarriage than any of them. This relic, man or some other creature\r\nas it may have been, stands midway between the chimpanzee and the\r\nmore typical \"Neandarthal Man,\" the skull of which was found in a\r\ncave of the Neander Valley, near Dusseldorf, in 1856. Thirty years\r\nlater the skulls of the \"Spy men\" of the same type as this were\r\nfound in Belgium. This type lived in what we call the early Stone\r\nAge, and was a low type of meat-eating hunter. The next higher type,\r\nthe third type of man, is that identified with what geologists and\r\nanthropologists call the \"Gibraltar skull,\" from the place where\r\nthe skull was found. But all we know of these types of man we must\r\njudge from their skulls and from the stone implements and the animals\r\nfound near them. The skulls of primitive men and of modern men show\r\na certain difference in shape. If we take two skulls, that of a man\r\nand a monkey, and draw a line from the region just over the nose to\r\nthe place at the back of the skull just above where it joins the\r\nbackbone, there is left above the line a great dome in the human\r\nskull, whereas in the monkey the place left above is much flatter\r\nand much shallower. Now the skull of the _Pithecanthropos erectus_\r\nfound in Java resembles the monkey's skull in this shallowness; and\r\nthe skulls of the Neandarthal and the Spy men also had shallower\r\nbrain-pans than the men of to-day. They may, therefore, be either\r\ndifferent creatures or they may merely have had smaller brains. We\r\ncan only say that the creature called Man suddenly appears among\r\nthe lower animals with a brain some five or six times the bulk (in\r\nproportion to his size and weight) of that of any surviving ape.\r\nGreat as is the difference, it is one of the most curious facts in\r\nthe history of man's development that the bulk of his brain does not\r\nseem to have continued to increase in any very marked degree since\r\nthe early Ages of Stone.\r\n\r\nWhat were the Stone Ages? In the long years before primitive man\r\nlearned to weld iron or bronze he formed his weapons and his tools\r\nfrom stone and flint; and geologists and antiquarians have discovered\r\nseveral of these \"Ages of Stone\" of different periods. For example,\r\nthe Stone Age which our grandfathers spoke of is now called the\r\nNeolithic Age; and in the second quarter of the last century it\r\nbecame gradually admitted that man had existed earlier than that and\r\nhad swung hammers and chipped edges in what we now call Palæolithic\r\ntimes. That would put man back to the age of the Mammoth. But in the\r\nlast quarter of last century a new claim arose. The Palæolithic stone\r\nweapons and tools were made 150,000 years ago, and were manufactured\r\nwith great skill and even artistic feeling. Within the last ten years\r\nmuch rougher flint implements of peculiar types have been found in\r\ngravels which are 500 to 700 feet above the level of the existing\r\nrivers--in the drift of which Palæolithic implements were found. To\r\nthese older, clumsier weapons and tools--if, indeed, implements they\r\nbe--the name Eoliths was given by Mr. J. Allen Brown. These Eoliths\r\nof the south of England and of Belgium indicate a race of men of\r\nless developed skill than the makers of the Palæoliths, and carry\r\nthe antiquity of man at least as far back beyond the Palæoliths as\r\nthese are from the present day. So much for speculation. But are the\r\nEoliths truly implements, or are they, as a determined school of\r\nanthropologists assert, merely flints which fortuitously resemble\r\nthe rougher variety of true Palæolith? The strongest attack made on\r\ntheir authenticity comes from Professor Boule and M. Laville, of the\r\nFrench School of Mines, who say that in the flint waste of a cement\r\nfactory at Mantes they have discovered \"pseudo-Eoliths\" which are\r\nmade by the action of the water of the mill, and which resemble every\r\nknown variety of the so-called \"Eolith.\" Their suggestion is that\r\nEoliths were not made by man at all but were produced by the action\r\nof running water. To which the Eolithic anthropologists retort that\r\nEoliths ought surely to be produced by running water now, and that\r\nsome Seine-made Eoliths would be more convincing. The differences\r\nbetween the Mantes specimens and the \"true\" Eolith cannot be detected\r\nby the untrained eye; but, spite of the French sceptics, the school\r\nof believers in the genuineness of the Eolith is growing.\r\n\r\nWe need not enter further into these controversies, and we need only\r\nsay that flint implements of various kinds are found all over the\r\nworld, in Egypt before the Pharaohs, in Australia, in South Africa,\r\nand indeed in every continent. They are being made even to-day by\r\naborigines in Australasia, and there is even a \"flint knapping\"\r\nindustry which survives to-day at Brandon, in Suffolk, though these\r\nflints are not intended for use as spear-heads or arrow-heads or\r\nanything so primitive. There is little geological evidence to show\r\nthe place where man first appeared; but what we know of his frame\r\nand constitution induces us to believe that somewhere in the warm\r\nclimate of Southern Asia was his first habitation. From this, or\r\nfrom some similar tract in that quarter of the globe, there seems to\r\nhave been four great migratory movements. These were complicated by\r\nreverse movements, by cross migrations, and by wanderings, which we\r\nshall probably never altogether understand; and so we can only sum up\r\nbriefly the chief features of them.\r\n\r\nThe greatest movement appears to have been north-eastward between\r\nthe great desert and mountain tract of Central Asia on the one hand,\r\nand the Pacific on the other, attended by divergences eastward to\r\nmany islands (as they are now) of the Pacific. When the emigrants\r\ngot too far north to wish to explore further, they spread out to\r\neast and west, forming a belt below the Arctic regions and sending\r\na branch down the whole length of the American Continent. This\r\nmovement embraced the Mongoloid races, and included the old American\r\nIndians and the Malayan races. Before the disturbing influences of\r\nman's later development, this branch had three notable centres of\r\ncivilisation: the Chinese in Asia, the Mexican in North America, and\r\nthe Peruvian in South America.\r\n\r\nA second and much less numerous band of emigrants struck out to the\r\nsouth-east, and reaching the southern hemisphere gave rise to the\r\nAustralian and New Zealand aboriginal races--all peoples who never\r\nrose very much or developed notable power.\r\n\r\nTo a third movement to the south-west is assigned the peopling of\r\nAfrica south of the Sahara with the negro and similar races, which\r\nhave become very numerous but never very powerful or intelligent.\r\n\r\nThe fourth movement was north-westward across or around the barriers\r\nof desert and mountain to Western Asia, Europe, and North Africa.\r\nThese emigrants were the true adventurers, hardy, progressive, and\r\nenergetic; and their descendants have developed into the strongest\r\nand most vigorous of the human family. The less progressive of them\r\nremain still on the further side of the mountains of Western Asia.\r\nThe three passage-ways used by the original emigrants seem to have\r\nbeen (1) the Red Sea Nile-Valley path, in which the dusky white and\r\nthe Ethiopian races mingled; (2) the Euphrates Valley, down which\r\nthe Semitic races moved; and (3) the tracts of the more northerly\r\nplateau, across which moved the ancestral Aryan races. It is also\r\nquite certain that some races moved backwards by this route and\r\nreturned to India to give rise to the Brahmins, the most learned race\r\nof that country.\r\n\r\nWe have thus traced, so far as our limited knowledge will allow\r\nus, the geographical spread of man's dominance. But we cannot\r\nassociate him with the history that in previous chapters we have\r\nroughly traced, of the development of the lower members of the\r\nanimal kingdom. The qualities which have developed in Man are of\r\nsuch an unprecedented power and so far dominate everything else in\r\nhis characteristics and surroundings that they justify the view that\r\nhe forms a new departure in the gradual unfolding of this world's\r\npredestined scheme. Knowledge, Reason, Self-consciousness, Will,\r\nare the attributes of Man. He goes on from strength to strength,\r\nand in the Divine purpose which created him may lie the possibility\r\nthat in the future he may attain a fuller knowledge than any he yet\r\npossesses. The great poet of the Victorian Age wrote of Knowledge:--\r\n\r\n    Flower in the crannied wall\r\n    I pluck you out of the crannies;\r\n    I hold you there, root and all, in my hand,\r\n    Little flower--but if I could understand\r\n    What you are, root and all, and all in all,\r\n    I should know what God and man is.\r\n\r\nThe nearer approach to that understanding is the greatest and truest\r\naim of scientific investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adelsberg, Caverns of, 195\r\n  _Æpyornis_, The, 252\r\n  \"Age of Lakes,\" The, 257\r\n  Air, how it may become solid, 84\r\n  Aleutian Islands, Volcanoes of the, 97\r\n  Algæ, 103\r\n  Alluvium, 54\r\n  America in the Devonian Period, 217;\r\n    in the Glacial Period, 271\r\n  Ammonites, 210\r\n  Amœba, The, 100\r\n  Andes, Volcanoes of the, 97\r\n  Andesite, 184\r\n  Andromeda, 92\r\n  Animal Life, The first, 104\r\n  Animal Species of the Carboniferous Period, 229\r\n  Ant, White, The work of the, 44\r\n  Anthracite, 133\r\n  Apes, The first, 268\r\n  _Apteryx_, The, 252\r\n  Archæan Era, 129, 199\r\n  _Archæopteryx_, The, 243\r\n  _Archelon, The_, 249\r\n  Arches, The strain on, 25\r\n  Aristotle and Earthquakes, 176\r\n  Armadillos, 275\r\n  Arrhenius, Prof., Theory of, 88\r\n  _Arsinoitherium_, The, 266\r\n  Assam, Earthquake in, 155\r\n  Atmosphere, has the Moon one? 123;\r\n    of Mars, 126\r\n  Atmospheric pressure, 80, 101\r\n  Attraction of bodies, 102\r\n  Austen, Sir W.

Now that electricity plays\r\nsuch an all-important part in our daily life, such a book as this\r\nshould be in the hands of every boy. Indeed, older people would learn\r\nmuch from its pages.
