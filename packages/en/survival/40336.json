As originally planned, it included an account of the\r\nrelations of the State to trade and manufacturing industry, the growth\r\nof which is the most pregnant economic phenomenon of the period. But I\r\nsoon found that the material was too abundant to be treated\r\nsatisfactorily in a single work, and I have therefore confined myself\r\nin the following pages to a study of agrarian conditions, whose\r\ntransformation created so much distress, and aroused such searchings\r\nof heart among contemporaries. The subject is one upon which much\r\nlight has been thrown by the researches of eminent scholars, notably\r\nMr. Leadam, Professor Gay, Dr. Savine, and Professor Ashley, and its\r\nmediæval background has been firmly drawn in the great works of\r\nMaitland, Seebohm, and Professor Vinogradoff. The reader will see that\r\nI have availed myself freely of the results of their investigations.\r\nBut I have tried, as far as the time at my disposal allowed, to base\r\nmy picture on original authorities, both printed and manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe supreme interest of economic history lies, it seems to me, in the\r\nclue which it offers to the development of those dimly conceived\r\npresuppositions as to social expediency which influence the actions\r\nnot only of statesmen, but of humble individuals and classes, and\r\ninfluence, perhaps, most decisively those who are least conscious of\r\nany theoretical bias. On the economic ideas of the sixteenth century\r\nin their relation to agrarian conditions I have touched shortly in\r\nPart III. of the book, and I hope to treat the whole subject more\r\nfully on some future occasion. If in the present work I have given, as\r\nI am conscious that I have, undue space to the detailed illustration\r\nof particular changes, I must plead that one cannot have the dessert\r\nwithout the dinner, and that a firm foundation of fact, even though as\r\ntedious to read as to arrange, is a necessary preliminary to the\r\nhigher and more philosophical task of analysing economic conceptions.\r\nThe reader who desires to start with a bird's-eye view of the subject\r\nis advised to turn first to the concluding chapter of Part III.\r\n\r\nOne word may be allowed in extenuation of the statistical tables,\r\nwhich will be found scattered at intervals through the following\r\npages. In dealing with modern economic conditions it is increasingly\r\nrecognised that analysis, to be effective, must be quantitative, and\r\none of the disadvantages under which the student of all periods before\r\nthe eighteenth century labours is that for large departments of life,\r\nsuch as population, foreign trade, and the occupations of the people,\r\nanything approaching satisfactory quantitative description is out of\r\nthe question. The difficulty in the treatment of agrarian history is\r\ndifferent. Certain classes of manorial documents offer material which\r\ncan easily be reduced to a statistical shape. Indeed one difficulty is\r\nits very abundance. The first feeling of a person who sees a\r\nmanuscript collection such as that at Holkham must be \"If fifty maids\r\nwith fifty mops--,\" and a sad consciousness that the mop which he\r\nwields is a very feeble one. But historical statistics should be\r\nregarded with more than ordinary scepticism, inasmuch as they cannot\r\neasily be checked by comparison with other sources of information, and\r\nit may reasonably be asked whether it is possible to obtain figures\r\nthat are sufficiently reliable to be used with any confidence. Often,\r\nno doubt, it is not possible. The strong point of surveyors was not\r\nalways arithmetic. The forms in which their information has been cast\r\nare sometimes too various to permit of it being used for the purpose\r\nof a summary or a comparison. Even when figures are both accurate and\r\ncomparable the student who works over considerable masses of material\r\nwill be fortunate if he does not introduce some errors of his own. The\r\ntables printed below are marred by all these defects, and I have\r\nincluded them only after considerable hesitation. I have tried to\r\nprevent the reader from being misled by pointing out in an appendix\r\nwhat I consider to be their principal faults and ambiguities. But no\r\ndoubt there are others which have escaped my notice.\r\n\r\nIt remains for me to express my gratitude to those whose kind\r\nassistance has made this work somewhat less imperfect than it would\r\notherwise have been. I have to thank the Warden and Fellows of All\r\nSouls College, the Senior Bursar of Merton College, the Clerk of the\r\nPeace for the County of Warwick, and the Earl of Leicester for\r\npermission to examine the manuscripts in their possession. The maps\r\nillustrating enclosure are taken from the beautiful maps of the All\r\nSouls estates; my thanks are due to the College for allowing me to use\r\nthem, and to Mr. W. Tomlinson, of the Oxford Tutorial Class at\r\nLongton, for helping me to prepare them for reproduction.\r\nCircumstances preventing me from working in the Record Office, I was\r\nso fortunate as to secure the co-operation of Miss Niemeyer and Miss\r\nL. Drucker, who have transcribed for me a large number of surveys and\r\nrentals. How much I owe to their help will be apparent to any one who\r\nconsults my footnotes and references. Among those who have aided me\r\nwith advice and information I must mention Professor Vinogradoff,\r\nProfessor Unwin, and Professor Powicke, the late Miss Toulmin Smith,\r\nMr. Kenneth Leys, Mr. F.W. Kolthammer, Lieut.-Colonel Fishwick, Dr.\r\nG.H. Fowler, and the Hon. Gerard Collier. Especially great are my\r\nobligations to Mr. R.V. Lennard and Mr. H. Clay, who have read through\r\nthe whole of the following pages in manuscript or in proof, and who\r\nhave helped me with numberless criticisms and improvements.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I owe two debts which are beyond acknowledgment. The\r\nfirst is to my wife, who has collaborated with me throughout, and\r\nwithout whose constant assistance this book could not have been\r\ncompleted. The second is to the members of the Tutorial Classes\r\nconducted by Oxford University, with whom for the last four years it\r\nhas been my privilege to be a fellow-worker. The friendly smitings of\r\nweavers, potters, miners, and engineers, have taught me much about\r\nproblems of political and economic science which cannot easily be\r\nlearned from books.\r\n\r\n R.H.T.\r\nMANCHESTER, _April 1912_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                       PAGE\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION                                                              1\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.--THE SMALL LANDHOLDER\r\n\r\nCHAP.\r\n\r\nI.

The economist can\r\nwatch the reaction of growing markets on the methods of subsistence\r\nfarming, the development of competitive rents, the building up of the\r\ngreat estate, and the appearance, or at any rate the extension, of the\r\ntripartite division into landlord, capitalist farmer, and landless\r\nagricultural labourer, the peculiar feature of English rural society\r\nwhich has been given so much eulogy in the eighteenth century and so\r\nmuch criticism in our own. From a legal point of view the great feature\r\nof the period is the struggle between copyhold and leasehold, and the\r\nground gained by the latter. Before the century begins, leases for\r\nyears, though common enough on the demesne lands and on land taken from\r\nthe waste, are the exception so far as concerns the land of the\r\ncustomary tenants. When the century closes, leasehold has won many\r\nobstinately resisted triumphs; much land that was formerly held by copy\r\nof court roll is held by lease; and copyhold tenure itself, through the\r\nweakening of manorial custom, has partially changed its character. The\r\ncopyholders, though still a very numerous and important class, are\r\nalready one against which the course of events has visibly begun to\r\nturn, and economic rent, long intercepted and shared, through the fixity\r\nof customary tenure, between tenant and landlord under the more elastic\r\nadjustments of leasehold and competitive fines, begins to drain itself\r\ninto the pockets of the latter. Politically, one can see different views\r\nof the basis of wealth in conflict, that which measures it by the number\r\nof tenants \"able to do service\" contending with that which tests it by\r\nthe maximum pecuniary returns to be got from an estate, and which treats\r\nthe number of tenants as quite a subordinate consideration. The former\r\nis the ideal of philosophical conservatives, is supported, for military\r\nand social reasons, by the Government, and survives long in the North;\r\nthe latter is that of the new landed proprietors, and wins in the South.\r\n\r\nAnd its victory results in much more than a mere displacement of\r\ntenants. It means ultimately a change in the whole attitude towards\r\nlandholding, in the doctrine of the place which it should occupy in the\r\nState, and in the standards by which the prosperity of agriculture is\r\nmeasured, drawing a line between modern English conceptions and those of\r\nthe sixteenth century as distinct as that which exists between those of\r\nthe Irish peasantry and Irish landlords, or between the standpoint of a\r\nFrench peasant and that of the agent of a great English estate. The\r\ndecline of important classes alters the balance of rural society, though\r\nthe Crown for a long time tries to maintain it, and the way is prepared\r\nboth for the economic and political omnipotence which the great landed\r\naristocracy will exercise over England as soon as the power of the Crown\r\nis broken, and for the triumph of the modern English conception of\r\nlandownership, a conception so repugnant both to our ancestors and to\r\nthe younger English communities,[1] as in the main a luxury of the\r\nricher classes. If it had not been for the undermining of the small\r\nfarmer's position in the sixteenth century, would the proposal[2] to\r\nenfranchise copyholders have been thrown out in 1654, and would the\r\nenclosures[3] of the eighteenth century have been carried out with such\r\nobstinate indifference to the vested interests of the weaker rural\r\nclasses? Would England have been unique among European countries in the\r\nconcentration of its landed property, and in the divorce of its\r\npeasantry from the soil?\r\n\r\n    [1] See the land legislation of the Australasian Colonies.\r\n\r\n    [2] The Instrument of Government (December 1653) established a\r\n    franchise qualification of rent or personal estate to the value\r\n    of £200. This certainly would have enfranchised a large number\r\n    of copyholders and leaseholders, some of whom were much better\r\n    off than the small freeholders. For an estate of £299, 15s. 4d.\r\n    left at death by a tenant \"Husbandman\" see _Nottingham Borough\r\n    Records_ under the year 1599 (vol. iv. pp. 249-252). It was made\r\n    up as follows: \"Money in purse and his clothes, £15; value of\r\n    beasts, £74; corn sowne in fields, £35; value of furniture in\r\n    hall, £2, 13s.; in parlour, £5, 14s., and other miscellaneous\r\n    possessions.\" For wills of husbandmen and yeomen see _Surtees\r\n    Society_, vol. lxxix., pp. 181-182, 263-264, 294, 310. For the\r\n    restoration of the franchise to the freeholders, see Gardiner,\r\n    _The Commonwealth_, iii. 78.\r\n\r\n    [3] Hammond, _The Village Labourer_, 1760-1832. One may add--if\r\n    English statesmen had studied the history of customary tenures\r\n    in England, would they have deferred until 1870 legislation\r\n    protecting tenant right in Ireland? See Lord Morley's\r\n    description of the Irish cultivator \"as a kind of copyholder or\r\n    customary freeholder\" (_Life of Gladstone_, vol. ii. p. 281).\r\n\r\nFrom a wider point of view the agrarian changes of the sixteenth century\r\nmay be regarded as a long step in the commercialising of English life.\r\nThe growth of the textile industries is closely connected with the\r\ndevelopment of pasture farming, and it was the export of woollen cloth,\r\nthat \"prodigy of trade,\" which first brought England conspicuously into\r\nworld-commerce, and was the motive for more than one of those early\r\nexpeditions to discover new markets, out of which grew plantations,\r\ncolonies, and empire. Dr. Cunningham[4] has shown that the system of\r\nfostering the corn trade, which was embodied in the Corn Bounty Act of\r\n1689, and which was a principle of English policy long after the reason\r\nfor it had disappeared, was adopted in a milder form in the reign of\r\nElizabeth with the object of checking the decline in the rural\r\npopulation. Again, new agricultural methods were a powerful factor in\r\nthe struggle between custom and competition, which colours so much of\r\nthe economic life of the period, and, owing to this fact, they produced\r\nreactions which spread far beyond their immediate effect on the classes\r\nmost closely concerned with them. The displacement of a considerable\r\nnumber of families from the soil accelerated, if it did not initiate,\r\nthe transition from the mediæval wage problem, which consisted in the\r\nscarcity of labour, to the modern wage problem, which consists in its\r\nabundance. Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nmunicipal[5] authorities were engaged in a prolonged struggle to\r\nenforce their exclusive economic privileges against the rural immigrant\r\nwho had lost his customary means of livelihood and who overcrowded town\r\ndwellings and violated professional byelaws; while the Government\r\nprevented him from moving without a licence, and when he moved,\r\nstraitened[6] his path between the Statute of Inmates on the one hand\r\nand the House of Correction on the other. Observers were agreed that the\r\nincrease in pauperism[7] had one capital cause in the vagrancy produced\r\nby the new agrarian régime; and the English Poor Law system, or the\r\npeculiar part of it providing for relief of the able-bodied, which\r\nEngland was the first of European countries to adopt, came into\r\nexistence partly as a form of social insurance against the effect of the\r\nrack rents and evictions, which England was the first of European\r\ncountries to experience. Whatever uncertainty attaches to the causes and\r\neffects of the agrarian problem, there can be no doubt that those who\r\nwere in the best position to judge thought it highly important. If it is\r\nnot a watershed separating periods, it is at least a high range from\r\nwhich both events and ideas descend with added velocity and\r\ndefiniteness. To the economic historian the ideas are as important as\r\nthe events. For though conceptions of social expediency are largely the\r\nproduct of economic conditions, they acquire a momentum which persists\r\nlong after the circumstances which gave them birth have disappeared, and\r\nact as over-ruling forces to which, in the interval between one great\r\nchange and another, events themselves tend to conform.\r\n\r\n    [4] Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce, Modern\r\n    Times_, Part i. pp. 85-88, 101-107, 540-543.\r\n\r\n    [5] See _e.g. Records of the Borough of Reading_, vol ii. pp.\r\n    36, 94, 156; vol. iii., 131, and those of Leicester, Norwich,\r\n    Nottingham, and Southampton, _passim_; also below, pp. 275-277.\r\n\r\n    [6] \"Mr. Secretary Cecil said, ...

Though the books and pamphlets\r\nof the age contain much that is of interest in the development of\r\neconomic theory, their writers rarely attempted to separate economic\r\nfrom other issues, and economic speculation usually took the form of\r\ndiscussions upon particular points of public policy, or of a casuistry\r\nprescribing rules for personal conduct in difficult cases. Such a\r\ndifficult case, such a problem of public policy, was offered by the\r\ngrowth of competitive methods of agriculture. The moral objections felt\r\nto the new conditions caused them to be a favourite subject with writers\r\nof sermons and pamphlets, and made the sins of the encloser, like those\r\nof the usurer, one of the standbys of the sixteenth century preacher.\r\nThere is, therefore, a considerable volume of writings dealing with the\r\nquestion from the point of view of the teacher of morality. At the same\r\ntime the political significance of the movement, and the fact that the\r\nclasses concerned were important enough to elicit attempts at protection\r\non the part of the Government, called forth a crop of suggestions and\r\ncomments like those of More, Starkey,[8] Forest,[9] the author of the\r\nCommonwealth[10] of England, and, at a later date, Powell[11] and\r\nMoore.[12] Further, the new agricultural methods were explained by\r\npersons interested in the economics of agriculture, such as\r\nFitzherbert,[13] Tusser,[14] Clarkson,[15] who surveyed the manors of\r\nthe Earl of Northumberland in 1567, Humberstone[16] who did the same for\r\nthose of the Earl of Devonshire, and Norden.[17] The accounts of\r\nsurveyors, a dull but indispensable tribe, are reliable, as they are\r\nusually statements of facts which have occurred within their own\r\nexperience, or at any rate, generalised descriptions of such facts. The\r\nsame may be said of the evidence of John Hales, who was employed by the\r\nGovernment in investigating the question, and who had to explain it in\r\nsuch a way as to convince opponents, and to get legislation on this\r\nsubject through a bitterly hostile Parliament. The description given by\r\nwriters like Latimer,[18] Crowley,[19] and Becon[20] are valuable as\r\nshowing the way in which the movement was regarded by contemporaries;\r\nbut they are mainly somewhat vague denunciations launched in an age when\r\nthe pulpit was the best political platform, and their very positiveness\r\nwarns one that they are one-sided and must be received with caution.\r\nStill, they mark out a field for inquiry, and one may begin by setting\r\nout the main characteristics of the agrarian changes as pictured in\r\ntheir writings.\r\n\r\n    [8] E.

Extract quoted in England in the\r\n    reign of King Henry the Eighth (Part I., p. lxxvi.).\r\n\r\nThe movement originates, they agree, through the covetousness[21] of\r\nlords of manors and large farmers, who have acquired capital in the\r\nshape of flocks of sheep, and who, by insisting on putting the land to\r\nthe use most profitable to themselves, break through the customary\r\nmethods of cultivation. The outward sign of this is enclosing, the\r\ncutting adrift of a piece of land from the common course of cultivation\r\nin use, by placing a hedge or paling round it, and utilising it\r\naccording to the discretion of the individual encloser, usually with the\r\nobject of pasturing sheep. This is accompanied by land speculation and\r\nrack-renting, which is intensified by the land-hunger which causes\r\nsuccessful capitalists,[22] who have made money in trade, to buy up\r\nland as a profitable investment for their savings, and by the sale of\r\ncorporate property which took place on the dissolution[23] of the\r\nmonasteries and the confiscation of part of the gild estates. The\r\nconsequence is, first, that there is a scarcity of agricultural produce\r\nand a rise[24] in prices, which is partly (it is supposed) attributable\r\nto the operations of the great graziers who control the supplies of\r\nwool, grain, and dairy produce, and secondly and more important that the\r\nsmall cultivator suffers in three ways. Agricultural employment is\r\nlessened. Small holdings are thrown[25] together and are managed by\r\nlarge capitalists, with the result that he is driven off the land,\r\neither by direct eviction, or by a rise in rents and fines, or by mere\r\nintimidation. At the same time the commonable[26] area, consisting of\r\nthe common waste, meadow, and pasture of the manor is diminished, with\r\nthe result that the tenants who are not evicted suffer through loss of\r\nthe facilities which they had previously had for grazing beasts without\r\npayment. There is, in consequence, a drift into the towns and a general\r\nlowering in the standard of rural life, due to the decay of the class\r\nwhich formerly sent recruits to the learned professions, which was an\r\nimportant counterpoise to the power of the great landed proprietors, and\r\nwhich was the backbone of the military forces of the country.[27]\r\n\r\n    [21] \"For looke in what partes of the realm doth growe the\r\n    fynest and therefore dearest woll, there noblemen and gentlemen,\r\n    yea, and certeyn abbotes, holy men no doubt, not contenting them\r\n    selfes with the yearely revenues and profytes, that were wont to\r\n    grow to their forefathers and predecessours of their landes, nor\r\n    being content that they live in rest and pleasure nothinge\r\n    profitting, yea much noyinge, the weal publique, leave no\r\n    grounde for tillage, thei inclose al into pasture; thei throw\r\n    doune houses; they plucke downe townes, and leave nothing\r\n    standynge, but only the churche to be made a shepehouse\" (More's\r\n    _Utopia_, Book I., p. 32, Pitt Press Series).\r\n\r\n    [22] \"The Grazier, the Farmer, the Merchants become landed men,\r\n    and call themselves gentlemen, though they be churls; yea, the\r\n    farmer will have ten farms, some twenty, and will be a\r\n    Pedlar-merchant\" (_King Edward's Remains: A Discourse about the\r\n    Reformation of many Abuses_). \"Look at the merchants of London,\r\n    and ye shall see, when by their honest vocation God hath endowed\r\n    them with great riches, then can they not be content, but their\r\n    riches must be abrode in the country, to bie fermes out the\r\n    handes of worshipful gentlemen, honest yeomen, and poor\r\n    laborynge husbands\" (_Lever's Sermons_, Arber's Reprints, p.\r\n    29).\r\n\r\n    [23] \"Do not these ryche worldlynges defraude the pore man of\r\n    his bread, ... and suffer townes so to decay that the pore hath\r\n    not what to eat, nor yet where to dwell?

It is worth noting that\r\n    Hales, who was quite conversant with the effect on general\r\n    prices of an increase in the supply of money, thought that the\r\n    rise which took place in his day was in some measure due to\r\n    monopolists. He describes his third Bill as ensuring that \"ther\r\n    wolde have byn within fyve yeares after the execution therof\r\n    suche plentie of vitteyll and so good cheape as never was in\r\n    England\" (_Commonweal_, p. lxiii.).\r\n\r\n    [25] Proclamation as before: \"Of late by thynclosinge of landes\r\n    and erable grounds, many have byn drevyn to extreme povertie,\r\n    insomuche that wheareas in tyme past, tenne, twentie, yea in\r\n    some places C. or CC.

Dissertations as to method are usually more controversial than\r\nprofitable, and we do not propose at this point to give any detailed\r\naccount of the order in which these problems have been taken up by\r\nprevious scholars, to pass any judgment upon the different kinds of\r\nevidence which they have used, or to offer any estimate of the value of\r\ntheir conclusions. If we are at all successful in our presentation of\r\nthe subject, the reader will discover for himself the nature of the\r\nevidence upon which we have relied, and where we differ from and agree\r\nwith the treatment of other writers. All we can attempt here is to give\r\na short statement of some of the principal issues which demand\r\nattention, a statement which does not pretend to be exhaustive, but\r\nwhich may serve to indicate the more salient features of the ground over\r\nwhich we shall travel.\r\n\r\nAs to the counties mainly affected by the agrarian changes there is now\r\nsubstantial agreement. The work of Mr. Leadam[28] and Professor Gay[29]\r\nseems to have put the geographical distribution of the movement towards\r\nenclosure, or at least of those enclosures which produced hardships,\r\nupon a fairly firm basis. We can say with some confidence that it mainly\r\naffected the Midlands and eastern counties, from Berkshire and\r\nOxfordshire in the south to Lincoln and Norfolk in the north-east, and\r\nthat it was least important in the south-western counties of Cornwall\r\nand Devon, and in the south-eastern counties of Kent and Essex, much of\r\nwhich had been enclosed before the sixteenth century began, and in the\r\nnorthern counties of Lancashire, Westmoreland, Cumberland,\r\nNorthumberland, and Durham, though, by the end of the sixteenth century,\r\nparts of the two latter counties, at any rate, were considerably\r\naffected by it. Again, the same authors have offered a statistical\r\nestimate of the extent of the movement which, while it is manifestly\r\ndefective, and while it can only be used with great caution to support\r\narguments as to the practical effect of enclosures, does offer some\r\nguide to the imagination, and is, at least, a valuable check on the\r\nconjectures made by contemporaries without any statistics at all and on\r\na basis merely of their personal impressions. Finally, the difficult\r\nquestion of the security of copyhold tenants as against the landlords\r\nwho desired to evict them seems to have been put in the right\r\nperspective by the evidence which Dr. Savine[30] has adduced to prove\r\nthat, in the case of copyholds of inheritance, a plaintiff who could\r\nshow a clear title could get legal redress.\r\n\r\n    [28] Leadam, _Domesday of Enclosures_.\r\n\r\n    [29] _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, vol. xiv. and vol. xvii.;\r\n    _Quarterly Journal of Economics_, vol. xvii. See also Gonner,\r\n    _Common Land and Inclosure_, pp. 132-152.\r\n\r\n    [30] _Quarterly Journal of Economics_, vol. xix. See below, pp.\r\n    287-297.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, certain points must still be pronounced highly\r\nobscure. The first is a simple one. The agrarian changes are usually\r\nsummed up under the name of \"Enclosure.\" But what exactly did enclosing\r\nmean? Contemporary writers represent it as almost always being carried\r\nout by lords and large farmers against the interests of the smaller\r\ntenantry. But there is abundant proof that the tenants themselves\r\nenclosed; and as they can hardly be supposed to have been forward in\r\ninitiating changes which damaged their own prospects, ought we not to\r\nbegin by drawing a distinction between the piecemeal enclosures made by\r\nthe peasantry, often after agreement between neighbours, from which they\r\nhoped to gain, and the great enclosures made by lords of manors from\r\nwhich the peasants obviously lost? Further, different authorities assign\r\ndifferent degrees of importance to different aspects of the movement.\r\nMr. Johnson[31] holds, for example, that the enclosure of the common\r\nwaste, as distinct from the enclosure of the arable fields, was\r\nrelatively unimportant. Such a view, however, is not easily reconciled\r\nwith the constant complaints which relate clearly to the enclosing of\r\ncommon wastes and pastures and with the state of things depicted in the\r\nsurveys.[32] Again, the writings of the period speak as though the\r\nmovement were mainly one from arable to pasture farming. But this was\r\nquestioned as long ago as the first thorough study of the question--that\r\nof Nasse[33]--and the doubts which he threw on their view of the problem\r\nare supported by Mr. Leadam by means of the statistics which he has\r\ndrawn from the returns of the Commission of 1517, though his conclusions\r\nare in their turn disputed by Professor Gay. In fact no one who examines\r\nthe picture given by the Commissions and by surveys and field maps can\r\nhelp feeling that the word \"enclosing,\" used by contemporaries as though\r\nit bore its explanation on its face, covered many different kinds of\r\naction and has a somewhat delusive appearance of simplicity.\r\n\r\n    [31] Johnson, _The Disappearance of the Small Landowner_, p. 40.\r\n\r\n    [32] See below, pp. 218-221 and 237-253.\r\n\r\n    [33] Nasse, _The Land Community of the Middle Ages_ (translated\r\n    for the Cobden Club by Colonel Ouvry, 1871), pp. 81-91: \"With\r\n    regard to the proper agricultural character of these movements\r\n    they are represented commonly as having been caused by an\r\n    exclusively pure pasture husbandry, which expelled the tillage\r\n    husbandman. Different circumstances, however, and witnesses show\r\n    us closely that this, for the most part, was not the case.\" The\r\n    discussion between Mr. Leadam and Professor Gay is contained in\r\n    the _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, New Series, vol. xiv. See also\r\n    Miss Davenport, _Quarterly Journal of Economics_, vol. xi., and\r\n    below, pp. 223-228.\r\n\r\nMoreover, who gained and who suffered by the enclosures, and to what\r\nextent? If the movement deserves to be called an agrarian revolution, it\r\nwas certainly one which left a great many holders of small landed\r\nproperty intact, and perhaps even improved their position. Otherwise we\r\ncan hardly account for the optimistic description of them, or of some of\r\nthem, which is given in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth\r\ncenturies by writers like Harrison,[34] Norden,[35] and Fuller,[36] or\r\nfor the part which this class played in the Civil War. Nor can we say\r\nwith confidence how the statistical evidence derived by Mr. Leadam and\r\nProfessor Gay from the reports of Royal Commissions should be\r\ninterpreted. The comparative smallness of the percentage of land which\r\nthe Commissioners returned as enclosed has led to the view[37] that the\r\nimportance of the whole movement was grossly exaggerated by the writers\r\nof the period, who created a storm in a tea-cup over changes which\r\nreally affected only an inconsiderable proportion of the whole country.\r\nIf this is so, it is not easy to explain either the continuous attention\r\nwhich was paid to the question by the Government, or the revolts of the\r\npeasantry, or the strong views of reasonable and fair-minded men with\r\nfirst-hand knowledge, such as John Hales.\r\n\r\n    [34] _Elizabethan England_, edited by Lothrop Withington, with\r\n    introduction by F.J. Furnivall, p. 119.\r\n\r\n    [35] J. Norden, _The Surveyor's Dialogue_.\r\n\r\n    [36] Thomas Fuller, _Holy and Profane State_.\r\n\r\n    [37] Gay, _Quarterly Journal of Economics_, vol. xvii., p. 587:\r\n    \"Hysterical and rhetorical complaint ... condemned by its very\r\n    exaggeration.\"\r\n\r\nThere is obscurity not only as to the details, but as to the outlines of\r\nthe movement. Different views have been expressed as to its origin,\r\nduration, and points of maximum intensity. Professor Ashley[38] puts the\r\nperiod of most rapid change from about 1470 to 1530. But these dates\r\ncannot be taken as in any way fixed. The greatest popular outcry[39]\r\nagainst enclosing occurred about the middle of the sixteenth century, in\r\nthe years 1548 to 1550. As Miss Leonard[40] has shown, there was much\r\nenclosing in the seventeenth century, and about 1650[41] there was a\r\ncrop of pamphlets against it similar in tone to the protests which\r\noccurred almost exactly a century before. It is especially difficult to\r\ndetermine how far back the movement should be carried. The first\r\nstatute[42] against it, that of 1489, is an obvious landmark. But has it\r\nnot been too readily accepted as an earlier limit? Hales[43] said that\r\nmost of the \"destruction of towns\" had taken place before the beginning\r\nof the reign of Henry VII. The allusion to enclosing in the\r\nChancellor's[44] speech to Parliament in 1483 shows that the movement\r\nmust have already obtained considerable dimensions. Rous[45] had\r\npetitioned Parliament on the subject of depopulation in 1459, and in his\r\nHistory, which was published sometime between that date and 1486, he\r\nreturned to the charge with a detailed account of the destruction of\r\nvillages in his own county of Warwickshire. More convincing than either,\r\nthe records of Manorial Courts[46] prove that the consolidation of\r\nholdings and collisions between the interests of commoners and\r\nsheep-farmers were quite common early in the fifteenth century. One may\r\nperhaps pause to remark that the question of the antecedent conditions,\r\nout of which the rapid agricultural changes of the sixteenth century\r\narose, is a very important one, and the more important the more\r\nfar-reaching those changes are thought to have been. It is surely\r\nincredible that the conversion of land to pasture, the growth of large\r\npasture estates, and the eviction of customary tenants, should have\r\noccurred to the extent described, unless considerable minor changes\r\npreceded them, and without some premonitory rumblings to suggest the\r\ncoming storm. In economic affairs new lines of organisation usually\r\nstart on a small scale before they attain dimensions sufficiently\r\nstriking to attract attention; and one would expect to be able to trace\r\nthe leading motives of the agrarian changes of the Tudor period far back\r\nin the fifteenth century and even earlier, and that they would throw\r\nlight on the nature of the subsequent movements. There is, further, some\r\ndifference of opinion as to the causes which forced the agrarian problem\r\nto the front. Some contemporary authorities attribute it mainly to the\r\ngrowth of the woollen industry,[47] and in this they have been followed\r\nby most subsequent writers. On the other hand, the direct evidence\r\nsupplied by price statistics seems to be not altogether reliable,[48]\r\nand in any case the woollen industry had been steadily growing for a\r\nhundred years before the complaints as to enclosure become general. This\r\nhas led Dr. Hasbach[49] to argue that the change in agricultural methods\r\nwas due less to the high price of wool than to the low price of grain,\r\nwhich was artificially reduced by the restrictions imposed on export\r\nunder the Tudors, and which he holds to have produced such a fall in\r\nrent as to result in the adoption of pasture-farming. Other writers have\r\nemphasised the revolutionary effect of the general depreciation in the\r\nvalue of money[50] and the consequent growth of commercialism in the\r\nrelations between landlord and tenant.\r\n\r\n    [38] Ashley, _Economic History_, vol. i. Part II., p. 286:\r\n    \"There were two periods of rapid change ... namely from c. 1470\r\n    to c. 1530, and again from about 1760 to 1830. After about 1530\r\n    the movement somewhat slackened.\"\r\n\r\n    [39] See below, Part III., chap. i.\r\n\r\n    [40] _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, vol. xix.

On a first view, at any rate, the whole\r\nhistory of the policy pursued in this matter, with one short interval\r\nfrom the autumn of 1549 to 1553, constitutes surely one of the most\r\nremarkable attempts to control changing economic conditions by\r\nGovernment action which has ever been made. Whether successful or\r\nunsuccessful, it throws much light on the ideas of the period with\r\nregard to the place in the State which should be occupied by the\r\nlandholding classes, on the relative advantages from a political\r\nstandpoint of large and small farming, and on the administrative\r\nmachinery of Government. The opinion generally[51] adopted seems to be\r\nthat the Acts forbidding conversion were entirely ineffective, and that\r\nthe Government, if sincere, was outmanœuvred by the Local\r\nAuthorities, whose duty it was to administer the laws, and whose\r\ninterest lay in preventing their administration. Much evidence may be\r\ncited in support of this view. On the other hand, we have clear proof of\r\nthe Council interfering on some occasions with apparent success; and\r\nfurther, it seems necessary to discriminate between the policies of\r\ndifferent periods. One cannot argue, for example, that because the\r\nstatutes protecting the poorer classes were not carried out by the\r\nrapacious oligarchy of adventurers which governed England from the fall\r\nof Somerset to 1553, therefore they were never used effectively in the\r\nreigns of Henry VIII., of Elizabeth, or of the first two Stuarts. Nor\r\nwould one be right in assuming the existence in the sixteenth century of\r\nthe identity of interest and policy between the great landlords and the\r\nGovernment which characterised the period from 1688 to 1832. One's\r\nconclusion on the whole question must depend less on direct evidence as\r\nto the success of the particular measures, which, in the nature of\r\nthings, is not easily obtainable, than on the opinion which one forms of\r\nthe degree of importance which the statesmen of the period assigned to\r\nthe class of small cultivators, and of the ability of the Central\r\nGovernment to get its policy executed.\r\n\r\n    [51] e.g. by Hasbach, _op. cit._ p. 37. Gay, _Trans. Royal Hist.\r\n    Soc._, vol. xviii. Contrast Miss Leonard, Trans. _Royal Hist.\r\n    Soc._, vol. xix. On the subject of the policy of the State\r\n    towards the agrarian problem, see below, Part III., chap. i.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the questions which are suggested by even a cursory\r\nsurvey of the agrarian problem. There are others which are less\r\nsusceptible of summary statement, but which involve issues that are of\r\nsome importance for the interpretation of economic history. Granted that\r\nit was inevitable that the subsistence husbandry of the mediæval village\r\nshould give way to capitalist agriculture, in what light are we to\r\nregard the changes by which that great transformation was brought about?\r\nOught we to think of the open field system as altogether incompatible\r\nwith any improvement in agricultural technique, as the miracle of\r\nsqualid perversity which it has appeared to some writers both of our own\r\nand of earlier ages, and as requiring the bitter discipline of pasture\r\nfarming and evictions to shake it out of its deep rut of custom, and to\r\nmake room for more progressive methods? Or are we to view it as\r\npermitting a good deal of mobility, and as already slowly developing a\r\nless rigid and cumbrous organisation when it was partially overwhelmed\r\nby rapid, and for the mass of the peasantry disastrous, changes? What\r\nplace ought the agrarian revolution of the sixteenth century to be given\r\nin that transition from mediæval to modern conditions of agriculture\r\nwhich, starting in England, has spread eastwards through almost every\r\nEuropean country, and which is beginning to-day even in India. How far\r\ndoes it compare and contrast with the enclosures of the period\r\nsucceeding the fall of the Stuarts, and with the analogous developments\r\nwhich have taken place on the continent, and how far does it present\r\nspecial features peculiar to itself? What were the relations between it\r\nand other aspects of national life? Have the economic changes which took\r\nplace in the world of agriculture any reflex in the social and political\r\nchanges occurring in the century which divides the Reformation from the\r\nCivil War? How far did the redistribution of property which they\r\neffected contribute to the decline in the condition of the poorer\r\nclasses which, according to most writers, took place in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and to the creation of the commercial aristocracy whose\r\ninfluence becomes so pronounced after the Restoration? What was the\r\nresult of these material developments in the realm of legal and economic\r\nideas? Ought we to minimise the communalism of the mediæval village? Or\r\nshould we think of the agrarian revolution of the sixteenth century as\r\nreally a new and decided movement in the direction of economic\r\nindividualism, a long step towards the growth of modern ideas of land\r\nownership and of the right of the individual to follow unfettered his\r\nown discretion in matters of economic enterprise, which gather weight at\r\nthe end of the seventeenth, and come to their own at the end of the\r\neighteenth, century?\r\n\r\nWe cannot pretend to answer these questions. We leave them as riddles\r\nfor the reader, with the words which a sixteenth century economist\r\nprettily prefaces to his analysis of the chief economic problems of his\r\nage:--\"And albeit ye might well saye that there be men of greater witte\r\nthen I; yet fools (as the proverb is) speake some times to the purpose,\r\nand as many headdes, so many wittes ... and though eche of theise by\r\nthem selves doe not make perfitte the thing, yet when every man bringeth\r\nin his guifte, a meane witted man maye of the whole (the best of everie\r\nmans devise beinge gathered together) make as it were a pleasant garland\r\nand perfitte.\"[52]\r\n\r\n    [52] Preface to _The Commonweal of this Realm of England_ (ed.\r\n    Lamond).\r\n\r\nIn the following pages we shall deal with our subject in the following\r\norder: Chapter I. of Part I. will describe the chief classes of tenants\r\nas they are set out in rentals and surveys, and in particular the\r\nfreeholders and customary tenants who formed the bulk of the\r\nlandholders. Chapters II., III. and IV. will discuss in some detail the\r\neconomic positions of the customary tenants both before and during the\r\nsixteenth century, the reasons for supposing that there had been a\r\nconsiderable growth in the prosperity of many of them before our period\r\nbegins, and the gradual modification in the customary conditions of\r\nrural life, as illustrated both by the growth of competitive payments on\r\nthose parts of the manor which were least controlled by custom, and by\r\nthe attempts made by the peasantry themselves to overcome by enclosure\r\nthe difficulties attaching to the methods of open field cultivation.\r\nChapter I. of Part II. will examine the reason which led to more rapid\r\nchanges in agricultural methods in the sixteenth century, and the growth\r\nof the large leasehold farms upon which these changes can be most easily\r\ntraced. Chapters II. and III. will discuss the reaction of these changes\r\nupon the peasantry and the question of the nature and security of their\r\ntenure. Chapter I. of Part III. will explain their political and social\r\nimportance and the policy of the State towards them. In Chapter II. we\r\nshall endeavour to offer a summary of our main conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nTHE SMALL LANDHOLDER\r\n\r\n    \"What comyn folke in all this world may compare with the comyns\r\n    of England in riches, freedom, liberty, welfare, and all\r\n    prosperity?

True, it cannot dispense with handicraftsmen and merchants, for\r\nours is an age of new buildings, new manufactures, new markets. The\r\ntraders of Europe are already beginning to look west and east after the\r\nexplorers; there are signs of an oceanic commerce arising out of the\r\ncoastwise traffic of the Middle Ages; and Governments are increasingly\r\nexercised with keeping foreign ports open and English ports closed. But\r\nwhether any particular artisan or trader is a profitable member of the\r\ncommonwealth is an open question. Too many of the manufactures which men\r\nbuy are luxurious[54] trifles brought from abroad and paid for with good\r\nEnglish cloth or wool or corn or tin, if not with gold itself--articles\r\nwhose use sumptuary legislation would do well to repress. As for\r\nmerchants,[55] if like honest men they give their minds to navigation,\r\nwell and good. But theirs is an occupation in which there is much room\r\nfor \"unlawful subtlety and sleight,\" for eking out the legitimate\r\nprofits earned by the labour of transport, with underhand gains filched\r\nfrom the necessitous by buying cheap and selling dear, for speculations\r\nperilously near the sin of the usurers who traffic in time itself.\r\nOutside the circle of a few statesmen and financiers, the men of the\r\nsixteenth century have not mastered the secret by which modern societies\r\nfeed and clothe (with partial success) dense millions who have never\r\nseen wheat or wool, though London and Bristol and Southampton are\r\nbeginning to grope towards it. Looking at the cornfields which are\r\nvisible from the centre of even the largest cities, they see that a\r\nsmall harvest means poverty and a good harvest prosperity, and that a\r\ndecrease of a few hundred acres in the area sown may make all the\r\ndifference between scarcity and abundance. A shortage in grain, which\r\nwould cause a modern State to throw open its ports and to revise its\r\nrailway tariff, sets a sixteenth century town[56] breaking up its\r\npastures and extending the area under tillage. No man is so clearly a\r\n\"productive labourer\" as the husbandman, because no man so unmistakably\r\nadds to the most obvious and indispensable forms of wealth; and though,\r\nin the system of classes which makes up the State, there are some whose\r\nfunction is more honourable, there is none whose function is more\r\nnecessary. In most ages there is some body of men to whom their\r\ncountrymen look with pride as representing in a special degree the\r\nstrength and virtues of the nation. In the sixteenth century that class\r\nconsisted of the substantial yeoman. Men speak of them with the same\r\nswaggering affection as is given by later generations to the sea-dogs.\r\nThe genius of England is a rural divinity and does not yet rule the\r\nwaves; but the English yeomen have \"in time past made all France\r\nafraid.\"[57] They absorb most of the attention of writers, both on the\r\ntechnique and on the social relations of agriculture. They are the\r\nfeet[58] upon which the body politic stands--the hands which, by\r\nministering to its wants, leave the brain free to act and plan. Let us\r\nbegin by trying to see how the landholding classes were composed.\r\n\r\n    [53] Pauli, _Drei volkswirthschaftliche Denkschriften aus der\r\n    Zeit Heinrichs VIII. von England_: How to reform the Realme in\r\n    setting them to work, and to restore tillage. \"The whole welth\r\n    of the body of the realm riseth out of labours and workes of the\r\n    common people.\"\r\n\r\n    [54] _The Commonweal of this Realm of England_ (Lamond), p. 63:\r\n    \"And I marvell no man taketh heade unto it, what nombre first of\r\n    trifles cometh hether from beyonde the seas, that we might\r\n    either clene spare, or els make them within oure owne Realme,\r\n    for the which we paie inestimable treasure every yeare, or els\r\n    exchange substanciall wares and necessaries for them.\" E.

I. c. 23: \"These\r\n    are they which in the old world got that honour to Englande ...\r\n    because they be so manie in number, so obedient at the Lorde's\r\n    call, so strong of bodie, so hard to endure paine, so courageous\r\n    to adventure ... these were the good archers in times past, and\r\n    the stable troops of footmen that affaide all France that would\r\n    rather die all, than once abandon the knight or gentleman their\r\n    captaine,\" and Harrison in _Elizabethan England_ (Withington),\r\n    pp. 11-13.\r\n\r\n    [58] E. E. T. S., _England in the Reign of King Henry VIII._,\r\n    Starkey's Dialogue, Part II., p. 49: \"To the handes are\r\n    resemblyd both craftysmen and warryarys.... To the fete the\r\n    plowmen and tyllarys of the ground, beycause they, by theyr\r\n    labour, susteyne and support the rest of the body.\"\r\n\r\nThe manorial documents supply us with much information about the\r\nlandholders, and though we cannot say what proportion[59] they formed of\r\nthe population, we ought to be able to say with some certainty the\r\nrelative numbers of different classes among them. In the surveys and\r\nrentals of the period persons holding land may usually be divided\r\nroughly according to the nature of their tenure into three\r\ngroups--freeholders, customary tenants, and leaseholders. This\r\nclassification[60] of course is an elastic and tentative one, which\r\nraises almost as many questions as it settles. The customary tenure of\r\none part of the country differs very much from the customary tenure of\r\nanother part. Customary tenants include copyholders and the vast\r\nmajority of tenants at will, who are holding customary land, and who are\r\noften entered under the latter heading merely because the surveyor did\r\nnot trouble to set out their full description. But tenancy at will is\r\nsometimes used to describe the condition, not only of the holder of\r\ncustomary land, but also of men who are mere squatters on the waste or\r\non the demesne, and who are not protected in their holdings by any\r\nmanorial custom. Again, it is not always easy to draw a line between\r\ncopyhold and leasehold. On a manor where the custom is least favourable\r\nto the tenants' interests the former shades into the latter. There is\r\nnot much difference, for example, between a lease for thirty-three years\r\nand a copyhold for life. Again, the classification is one of tenures not\r\nof tenants. In parts of England, it is true, it does divide individual\r\ntenants with almost complete exhaustiveness and precision. In most\r\ndistricts, for example, the free tenant usually holds freehold land and\r\nnothing else, the customary tenant customary land and no other. But in\r\nEast Anglia there is no such simplicity of arrangement, no such\r\npermanence of tenurial compartments. Many free tenants hold land which\r\nis said to be bond or villein or customary land; many customary tenants\r\nhold free land; many of both have added to their holdings by leasing\r\nparts of the demesne or of the waste, and though in this respect the\r\nEastern counties are exceptional, it is in them often impossible to say\r\nin what class any individual should be placed.\r\n\r\n    [59] In this essay we are concerned only with the landholders,\r\n    not with the wage workers. The relative number of persons\r\n    holding land and of agricultural labourers without land is an\r\n    important question on which it is not easy to get light. The\r\n    surveys and rentals, a species of private census invaluable in\r\n    giving information about the holders of property, tell us only\r\n    the number of householders, and as the labourers employed in\r\n    agriculture (like many of those employed in manufacturing\r\n    industry) usually lived on the premises of their masters, they\r\n    do not enable us to calculate the number of those living\r\n    entirely by their labour. Still, since they include all tenants,\r\n    whether holders of a cottage only or holders of land in\r\n    addition, they enable us to say what proportion of heads of\r\n    families held land, and what proportion had none, or none except\r\n    a garden. This is of some importance. A tenant holding even as\r\n    much as fifty acres can hardly have employed more than two or\r\n    three agricultural labourers, and most tenants held less than\r\n    this; so that in those places where the cottagers form a small\r\n    proportion of the whole population we may conclude that a large\r\n    proportion of the villagers were landholders (for the figures on\r\n    this point see the tables given below).\r\n\r\n    Unfortunately, we do not possess for the sixteenth century even\r\n    such a loose estimate as was made by Gregory King at the end of\r\n    the seventeenth. In 1688 he calculated that there were 16,560\r\n    families of nobles and gentlemen, 60,000 families of yeomen,\r\n    150,000 of farmers--presumably on lease--400,000 cottagers and\r\n    poor, 364,000 labouring people and out-servants, obviously a\r\n    very rough calculation, the most remarkable feature of which is\r\n    the large number of yeomen. Poll Tax returns might give us the\r\n    kind of information we require, since they included, or were\r\n    meant to include, the whole population above a certain age,\r\n    irrespective of whether they held land or not, and sometimes\r\n    divided them roughly into classes. Thus on sixteen manors in the\r\n    Norfolk Hundred of Thingoe the return to the Poll Tax of 1381\r\n    showed a population of 870 male and female inhabitants over\r\n    fifteen years of age, of whom 9 were set down as knights, 53 as\r\n    farmers, 102 as artificers, 344 as \"labourers\" (laboratores),\r\n    362 as \"servants\" (servientes). If, as is not improbable, the\r\n    first four classes held land (the labourers being serfs working\r\n    on the demesne), and the last consisted of farm and household\r\n    employees who did not, this would put the landholding classes on\r\n    these manors at a little more than half the total population\r\n    over the age of fifteen. But this return was probably falsified\r\n    to escape the tax; see Powell, _The East Anglian Rising_, App.\r\n    I., and Oman, _The Great Revolt of 1381_. The figures published\r\n    by Dr. Savine (_Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History_,\r\n    vol. i., pp. 223-226) of the monastic population show that on\r\n    the eve of the dissolution there were residing in 22 houses in\r\n    Leicester, Warwick, and Sussex, 255 \"hinds\" and 76 \"women\r\n    servants,\" presumably employed on the demesne farm, which gives\r\n    an average to each farm of about 11 hinds and about 3 women\r\n    servants. In the Kentish Nunnery of St. Sexburge, Sheppey, the\r\n    demesne farm employed a carter, a carpenter, two cowherds, a\r\n    thatcher, a horse keeper, a malter, three shepherds. Best,\r\n    describing his farming arrangements in Yorkshire in 1641\r\n    (_Surtees Society_, vol. xxxiii.), states: \"Wee kept constantly\r\n    five plowes goinge, and milked fowerteene kine, wherefore wee\r\n    had always fower men, two boyes to go with the oxeploughe, and\r\n    two good lusty mayde-servants.\" These were in each case only the\r\n    permanent staff, and their comparatively small numbers suggest\r\n    that much work must have been done by men who worked on their\r\n    own land and only occasionally helped on the demesne, _i.e._\r\n    that the proportion of landholders to non-landholders was high.\r\n    This conclusion agrees with the evidence of the surveys, which\r\n    show that, especially in the East of England, many of both the\r\n    free and the customary tenants' holdings were so small that they\r\n    could hardly have made a living out of them without working as\r\n    wage-labourers as well, and also with other indications as to\r\n    the classes in rural society; _e.g._ out of 3780 persons\r\n    mentioned in Worcestershire recognizances, 1591-1643, as either\r\n    \"labourers,\" \"husbandmen,\" or \"yeomen,\" 667 are entered as\r\n    labourers, 1303 as husbandmen, 1810 as yeomen, the latter\r\n    designation always, and the second usually, implying a holder of\r\n    land (J.W. Willis Bund, _Kalendar of the Sessions Rolls_,\r\n    1591-1643, Part II.) On the other hand, conditions varied\r\n    enormously from place to place. Where there was a considerable\r\n    body of small landowners the number of hired labourers tended to\r\n    be small, the work of cultivation being done by the holder and\r\n    his family; _e.g._ we read of a manor in the seventeenth century\r\n    where thirteen freeholders farmed 580 acres with the aid of only\r\n    ten men-servants and shepherds before enclosure, and six or\r\n    seven afterwards (Joseph Lee, _A Vindication of a Regulated\r\n    Enclosure_).\r\n\r\n    Some of the surveys supply us with extreme cases of the opposite\r\n    kind, where the whole manor consists of two or three holdings or\r\n    of even one great estate, and where almost the whole of the\r\n    population must have been working for wages; these illustrate\r\n    Harrison's complaint that in many places \"The land of the parish\r\n    is gotten up into a few men's hands; yea, sometimes, into the\r\n    tenure of one or two or three, whereby the rest are compelled\r\n    betimes to be hired servants unto the others, or else to beg\r\n    their bread in misery from door to door\" (Withington's edition\r\n    of _Elizabethan England_, p. 21). A protest made to the Council\r\n    from Norfolk in 1631 against its policy of trying to keep down\r\n    prices by insisting that all corn should be sold in the open\r\n    market points out that in \"the woodland and pasture part\" of the\r\n    country there are \"a great many handicraftsmen which live by\r\n    dressinge and combinge of wool, carding, spinning and weaving,\r\n    etc., and the Townes there commonly very great consisting of\r\n    such like people and other artificers with many poor, and none\r\n    of them all ordinarilye having any corn but from the market.\" As\r\n    to the \"champion part\" of the county, the document divides the\r\n    rural population into three classes: \"1. Tilth masters that have\r\n    corn of their own growing and sell it to others. 2. Labourers\r\n    that buy it at an under-price of them unto whom they worke. 3.\r\n    Poore people that are relieved by good orders in every towne\"\r\n    (_Original Papers of the Norfolk and Norwich Archæological\r\n    Society_, 1907). But the case of Norfolk was exceptional, owing\r\n    to its position as the chief seat of the textile industries.\r\n\r\n    On the whole I am inclined to think that though the process of\r\n    commutation which went on from 1350 onwards can hardly be\r\n    explained except on the supposition that there was a\r\n    considerable population of persons who held little land and were\r\n    ready to eke out a living by working for wages, yet in the\r\n    sixteenth century even the wage-working heads of families\r\n    usually held a certain amount of land (even if only a garden) as\r\n    well. This agrees with what we are told by contemporaries of the\r\n    scarcity of wage-earners (see below, pp. 99-102). One may add,\r\n    that in view of this, the fixing of maximum wages bears a\r\n    somewhat different colour from that often given it. It was only\r\n    practicable, one is inclined to say, because so few persons\r\n    depended entirely on wages for a living. The social problem in\r\n    the sixteenth century was not a problem of wages, but of rents\r\n    and fines, prices and usury, matters which concern the\r\n    small-holder or the small master craftsman as much as the\r\n    wage-earner. The \"working classes\" were largely small property\r\n    holders and small traders.\r\n\r\n    [60] The summary statement given above is liable to be\r\n    misleading. The reader will find a fuller discussion of the\r\n    questions arising in connection with it below in Part II., chap.\r\n    iii.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of many marginal cases, we may perhaps find in\r\nthe surveyors' classification a map of the broader features of the\r\ncountry through which we are to travel. Property holders, profit makers,\r\nand wage-earners are to-day inextricably confused, but to the economist\r\nwho writes on our social problems 200 years hence it will not be\r\naltogether useless to know that his predecessors did in practice draw\r\nrough distinctions between these classes, and formed estimates of the\r\nnumbers of each. Much of the agrarian problem of the sixteenth century\r\nturns on the question of the legal interest in their holdings enjoyed by\r\ndifferent classes of tenants, and though we cannot hope to escape the\r\npitfalls which await compilers of even the humblest census, a\r\npreliminary survey of their distribution in a few counties may not be\r\naltogether without value. The following figures are taken from the\r\nsurveys and rentals of 118 manors.[61] The majority were made in the\r\nreign of Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Elizabeth. There are included,\r\nhowever, three from the latter half of the fifteenth century and three\r\nfrom the years between 1630 and 1650. Under the heading of customary\r\ntenants are grouped copyholders and tenants at will, as well as those\r\nwho are called customary tenants in the rentals and surveys.\r\n\r\n    [61] They include also tenants on the lands belonging to\r\n    Cockersand Abbey, lying in many different parts of Lancashire,\r\n    in 1503. For the sources from which this table is constructed\r\n    and its defects, see Appendix II.\r\n\r\nScanty as they are, these figures show that there is the very greatest\r\nvariety in the distribution of different classes of tenants in different\r\nparts of the country, and remind us that we must be careful how we\r\ngeneralise from the conditions of one district to those of another. When\r\nall localities are handled together, customary tenants form nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole landholding population, freeholders about\r\none-fifth, leaseholders between one-eighth and one-ninth. But in parts\r\nof the Midlands and in parts of the West the leaseholders are much more\r\nnumerous than they are elsewhere; in Leicestershire they form over\r\none-fifth, and are almost as numerous as the freeholders, while if we\r\nisolate the five Somersetshire and Devonshire manors which above are\r\ncombined with those of Wiltshire, we find that in them the leaseholders\r\nexceed the freeholders by nearly two to one. Again, in Northumberland\r\nthe preponderance of customary tenants (where they form 91 per cent. of\r\nthe landholding population) over the two other classes is much more\r\nmarked than it is in Wiltshire, and in Wiltshire it is greater than it\r\nis in the three Midland counties and in East Anglia. That customary\r\ntenants should overwhelmingly preponderate in Northumberland is\r\nintelligible enough. If the single great manor of Rochdale be removed,\r\nthey preponderate almost as much in Lancashire. In those two wild\r\ncounties mediæval conditions survive long after they have begun\r\nelsewhere to disappear. There has been no growth of trade to bring\r\nmobile leasehold tenures in its train, or to accumulate the wealth which\r\nthe peasants need to enfranchise their servile tenancies. But why should\r\nthey be so much more numerous in the southern counties than they are in\r\nthe twenty-two Midland villages, where one would suppose the conditions\r\nto be much the same? Here, as often hereafter, we raise a question only\r\nto leave it unanswered.\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\n--------------------------+--------+--------+---------+--------+----------+\r\n                          | Total. | Free-  |Customary|Lease-  |Uncertain.|\r\n                          |        |holders.| Tenants.|holders.|          |\r\n--------------------------+--------+--------+---------+--------+----------+\r\nNorthumberland,           |   474  |     26 |    436  |    12  |          |\r\n  six manors              |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n                          |        |        |         |        |          |\r\nLancashire,               |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n  seven manors, and lands |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n  belonging to Cockersand |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n  Abbey                   |  1280  |   217  |    451  | 334[62]|    278   |\r\n                          +--------+--------+---------+--------+----------+\r\n                Total     |  1754  |   243  |    887  |   346  |    278   |\r\n                          |        |(13.8%) | (50.5%) |(19.04%)|   (15%)  |\r\n                          |        |        |         |        |          |\r\nStaffordshire,            |   356  |    44  |    272  |    23  |     17   |\r\n  six manors              |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n                          |        |        |         |        |          |\r\nLeicestershire,           |   618  |   134  |    311  |   124  |     49   |\r\n  nine manors             |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n                          |        |        |         |        |          |\r\nNorthamptonshire,         |   531  |   100  |    355  |    66  |     10   |\r\n  seven manors            |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n                          +--------+--------+---------+--------+----------+\r\n                Total     |  1505  |   278  |    938  |   213  |     76   |\r\n                          |        |(18.1%) | (62.3%) |(14.2%) |    (5%)  |\r\n                          |        |        |         |        |          |\r\nNorfolk,                  |1011[63]|   316  |    596  |    53  |     50   |\r\n  twenty-five manors      |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n                          |        |        |         |        |          |\r\nSuffolk,                  | 353    |   176  |    146  |    25  |      6   |\r\n  fourteen manors         |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n                          +--------+--------+---------+--------+----------+\r\n                Total     |1364[63]|   492  |    742  |    78  |     56   |\r\n                          |        |  (36%) | (54.3%) | (5.7%) |  (4.1%)  |\r\n                          |        |        |         |        |          |\r\nWiltshire, Somerset,      |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n  and Devonshire,         |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n  thirty-two manors       |  1102  |   149  |    817  |   136  |          |\r\n                          |        |        |         |        |          |\r\nHampshire,                |  259   |     8  |    251  |        |          |\r\n  two manors              |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n                          |        |        |         |        |          |\r\nTen other manors          |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n  in the south of         |        |        |         |        |          |\r\n  of England              |  219   |    43  |    158  |    12  |      6   |\r\n                          +--------+--------+---------+--------+----------+\r\n                Total     | 1580   |   200  |   1226  |   148  |      6   |\r\n                          |        |(12.6%) | (77.2%) | (9.3%) |  (0.3%)  |\r\n                          +--------+--------+---------+--------+----------+\r\n          Grand total     |6203[63]|  1213  |   3793  |   785  |    416   |\r\n                          |        |(19.5%) | (61.1%) |(12.6%) |  (6.7%)  |\r\n--------------------------+--------+--------+---------+--------+----------+\r\n\r\n    [62] The Lancashire figures are unduly weighted by those of the\r\n    single large manor of Rochdale, where, in 1626, there were 612\r\n    tenants. If this manor be omitted, there remain only 19\r\n    leaseholders on the other Lancashire manors. Like\r\n    Northumberland, Lancashire seems to be (as one would expect) a\r\n    county of customary tenants.\r\n\r\n    [63] There is an error of 4 in the Norfolk figures which I have\r\n    been unable to trace and correct.\r\n\r\nYet there is one point emerging from these figures of which the\r\nexplanation can hardly be in doubt. It will be noticed that in Norfolk\r\nand Suffolk combined the proportion of freeholders is about double what\r\nit is in the country as a whole. In the former county they form more\r\nthan one-third of all the landholders, and in the latter they are almost\r\nequal to the other two classes together. The number of peasant\r\nproprietors in Suffolk is indeed quite exceptional, and is one of the\r\nmost remarkable facts revealed by the surveys, drawing an unmistakable\r\nline between the land tenure of the east and that of the south-west and\r\nthe northern border. In Wiltshire and Northumberland it is not uncommon\r\nto find villages where no freeholders at all are recorded. In Norfolk\r\nand Lancashire it is the exception for them to be in a majority. But on\r\nhalf the Suffolk manors summarised above they are the largest class\r\nrepresented, and on some they stand to the other landholders in a\r\nproportion of two, three, and even four to one. Is it fanciful, one may\r\nask, to turn from the sixteenth century to the dim beginnings of things,\r\nto that first and greatest survey in which the land of England was\r\ndescribed so that not an ox or an acre escaped valuation, and in which,\r\nbefore freehold tenure had been hammered into any precise legal shape,\r\nSuffolk and Norfolk abounded more than all other counties in _liberi\r\nhomines_ and _sochemanni_? Though a longer time separates these\r\ndocuments from Domesday[64] than separates them from us, perhaps it is\r\nnot altogether fanciful. Rural life, except for one great catastrophe,\r\nhas been very permanent. Unlike rural life to-day, it has been most\r\npermanent in its lower ranges. How ever often manors may have changed\r\nhands, there has been little to break the connection with the soil of\r\npeasants whose title is good, no change at all comparable to the buying\r\nout of small freeholders which took place in the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries. It may well be that the main outlines of the\r\nsocial system which the Domesday commissioners found already laid in the\r\neast of England crop out again after the lapse of between four and five\r\nhundred years. It may well be that Suffolk is a county of small\r\nfreeholders in the days of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, because it was a\r\ncounty of free men and socmen in the days of William I.\r\n\r\n     [64] In Domesday Book 35 per cent. of all the tenants in Suffolk\r\n    are _liberi homines_, 32 per cent. of all those in Norfolk are\r\n    either _liberi homines_ or _sochemanni_. See Vinogradoff, _The\r\n    Growth of the Manor_, note 24 to chap. iii. Book III. (p. 376);\r\n    Maitland, _Domesday Book and Beyond_, p. 23; Seebohm, _The\r\n    English Village Community_, map opposite p. 85. Domesday also\r\n    gives a large number of _liberi homines_ and _sochemanni_ in\r\n    Leicestershire. In the table given above the Leicestershire\r\n    manors come after Suffolk and Norfolk as having the third\r\n    largest proportion of freeholders, viz., 21.6 per cent. The\r\n    return of freeholders supplied to the Government in 1561\r\n    (Lansdowne MSS. V., 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) appear to be\r\n    considerably understated, probably because only the more\r\n    substantial men were thought worth mentioning. They are as\r\n    follows: Beds 282, Berks 166, Essex 880, Notts 189, Oxon. 198,\r\n    Herts 363, York 787, Lincoln 444. The large number in Essex is\r\n    noteworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) _The Freeholders_\r\n\r\nIn spite of the constant complaints of the sixteenth century writers\r\nthat one effect of the agrarian changes was the decay of the yeomanry,\r\nwe shall not in the following pages be much concerned with the\r\nfreeholders. In our period the word \"yeomen\" was ceasing to be given the\r\nnarrow semi-technical sense which it possessed in Acts of Parliament and\r\nlegal documents, and was beginning to acquire the wide significance\r\nwhich it possesses at the present day. To the lawyer the yeoman meant a\r\nfreeholder,[65] \"a man who may dispend of his own free lande in yerely\r\nrevenue to the summe of 40s. sterling,\" and if the word yeoman was used\r\nin its strict legal sense, the decay of the yeomanry ought to have meant\r\na decline in the numbers of freeholders, such as occurred on a very\r\nlarge scale two and a half centuries later. But in this matter it seems\r\nthat popular usage was more elastic than legal definition, and, except\r\nwhen the significance to be given it is defined by the context, the word\r\nitself is not an accurate guide to the legal position of those to whom\r\nit is applied. Writers on constitutional questions were careful to\r\nobserve the stricter usage, because the 40s. freeholder occupied a\r\nposition in the State, both as a voter and in serving on juries, from\r\nwhich persons who, though much wealthier, were not freeholders, were\r\nexcluded. But the word yeoman was used, in speaking of agricultural\r\nconditions, to describe any well-to-do farmer beneath the rank of\r\ngentleman, even though he was not a freeholder. Thus Bacon[66] writes\r\nquite vaguely of \"the yeomanry or middle people, of a condition between\r\ngentlemen and cottagers or peasants.\" Those who insisted that the\r\nmilitary power of England depended on the yeomanry can hardly have meant\r\nto exclude well-to-do copyholders;[67] not only copyholders but even\r\nvilleins[68] by blood were sometimes described as yeomen; and, in fact,\r\neven writers who, like Sir Thomas Smith,[69] use the word most clearly\r\nin its strict legal sense on one page, allow themselves to slip into\r\nusing it in its wider and more popular sense on the next, when the\r\nsocial importance of the class and not its legal status is uppermost in\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\n    [65] Smith, _De Republica Anglorum_, Lib I., c. 23.\r\n\r\n    [66] _History of King Henry VII._ (Lumley), pp. 70-72. He makes\r\n    his meaning quite clear by saying \"tenancies for years, lives,\r\n    and at will, whereupon much of the yeomanry lived, were turned\r\n    into demesnes.\"\r\n\r\n    [67] _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, vol. xvii. (Savine, \"Bondmen\r\n    under the Tudors\").\r\n\r\n    [68] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [69] Smith, _De Republica Anglorum, loc. cit._\r\n\r\nNor is there much evidence that the freeholders suffered generally from\r\nthe agrarian changes of the sixteenth century. It is true that there are\r\nsome complaints from freeholders as to the loss of rights of pasture\r\nthrough the encroachments of large farmers upon the commonable area,\r\nsome cases of litigation between them and enclosing landlords. But,\r\nsince their payments were fixed, there was no way of getting rid of them\r\nexcept by buying them out, and though this method, which was so\r\nimportant a cause of the decline of the small freeholder in the\r\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, was occasionally employed to\r\nround off a great estate, it seems to have played a comparatively\r\nunimportant part in our period. There is no sign of any large diminution\r\nin their numbers, such as would have been expected if the movement had\r\naffected them in the same way as it did the customary tenants.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if the accounts of contemporary writers may be trusted, it would\r\nappear that their position was actually improved in the course of the\r\ncentury. Though even among quite small men one occasionally finds a\r\ntenant by knight[70] service, the vast majority of freeholders held in\r\nfree socage, owing fealty and suit of court, and paying a money rent,\r\nsometimes combined with the old recognitions[71] of dependent tenure,\r\nsuch as a gillyflower, a red rose, a pound of pepper, or a pound of\r\ncummin. But while on some manors some outward form of feudalism, such as\r\nhomage and fealty, were still maintained, the decay of feudal relations\r\nin the middle order of society had combined with economic causes to\r\nbetter their condition, and the time was already not far distant when\r\nthose who held by the more honourable tenure of knight service would\r\ninsist on its being assimilated to the humbler and less onerous tenure\r\nof the socager. The agricultural services of the socage tenants had long\r\ndisappeared. There are many instances of work on the demesne being done\r\nin the sixteenth century by copyholders; but there is in our records\r\nonly one manor where it was exacted from the freeholders, and other\r\nobligations were tending to go the way of the vanished predial labour.\r\nSuits of court might be owing, and set down as owing in the surveys, but\r\none may doubt very much whether they were often enforced. Owing to the\r\nfall in the value of money the fixed rent of the socager often yielded\r\nonly a small income to the lord of the manor, and in a good many cases\r\nthese payments had disappeared altogether before the end of the century,\r\nor were so unimportant as to be hardly worth the trouble of collecting.\r\nSurveyors for this reason were often little interested in them, and,\r\nwhile recording the acreage held by the customary tenants and\r\nleaseholders with scrupulous accuracy, did not always trouble to set out\r\nin detail the holdings of a class which was financially so\r\ninsignificant, with the result that sometimes the freeholders shook\r\nthemselves loose from all payments and services altogether. Nor, had the\r\nsurveyors been as careful as the heads of the profession would have had\r\nthem be, would they always have been successful in dealing with this\r\nvery independent class. They may protest that \"next[72] under the king\"\r\nthe freeholders \"may be said to be the lord's,\" but freehold lands have\r\na way of getting mislaid[73] to the despair of manorial officials, as\r\ncopyhold lands do to-day. When escheats occur, the holding cannot be\r\nfound; when rents are overdue, distraint is impossible, because the\r\nbailiff does not know on whom to distrain. The suggestion that, as long\r\nas rents are paid and services discharged, the lord has any interest in\r\nthe property of his freehold tenants, rouses instant resentment, and it\r\nwould seem that by our period, at any rate in the south of England, the\r\nconnection of the freeholders with the manor was a matter rather of form\r\nand sentiment than of substance. In fact freehold has almost assumed its\r\nmodern shape.\r\n\r\n    [70] MSS. of Earl of Leicester at Holkham. Billingford and\r\n    Bintry MSS.

Here is a bitter cry from the bailiff\r\n    of a manor (Merton Documents, No. 4381). \"Good sir let me\r\n    entreat you yf the Colledge determyne to make survey this spring\r\n    of the lands at Kibworth and Barkly to send Mr. Kay or me word a\r\n    month or 3 weeks before your coming that we may have Beare and\r\n    other necessaries, and I desire you to gather up all evidences\r\n    that may be needful for the Lordshipp, for all testimony will be\r\n    little enough, the Colledge land is so mingled with Mr. Pochin's\r\n    freehold and others in our towne. There ys an awarde for\r\n    keepinge in of the old wol (?) close in our fields for (from ?)\r\n    Mr. Pochin's occupation, very needfulle for the ynhabitannts yf\r\n    that awarde can be founde at the colledge where yt was loste.\"\r\n    (For the remainder of this letter see Appendix I.) The Crown\r\n    suffered especially, see Norden, _Speculum Britanniae_, Part I.,\r\n    pp. xl.-xliii. of introduction (Camden Society): \"In many of his\r\n    Majesty's manors, free holders, their rents, services, tenures\r\n    and landes ... become strange and unknown ... and when escheates\r\n    happen the lande that should redound to his Majesty cannot be\r\n    found.\" In the common entry in manorial surveys under the\r\n    heading of freeholders of \"certain lands\" we should probably\r\n    take the word \"certain\" to mean \"uncertain.\"\r\n\r\nIn assuming its modern shape it has made this particular strand in rural\r\nlife harder to unravel. By escaping from the supervision of the manorial\r\nauthorities the freeholders escape at the same time from the economic\r\nhistorian, and since the facts of their position go so often\r\nunrecorded, we can speak of it with much less confidence than we can\r\nabout that of the leaseholders and customary tenants. Out of over one\r\nhundred manors which we have examined, there are only twenty-two where\r\nit is possible to ascertain with any accuracy the acreage held by the\r\nfreeholders, and, even on these, one too often meets cases in which the\r\nextent of the holding is either unknown to the surveyor, or in which he\r\ndoes not think it worth while to record it. Our results, such as they\r\nare, are set out in the table on pages 32 and 33.[74]\r\n\r\n    [74] For the sources and defects of this table see Appendix II.\r\n\r\nCombining the information supplied by these figures with that obtained\r\nfrom other sources, we can form a rough idea of the agrarian conditions\r\nunder which the freeholders live. They are, in the first place, a most\r\nheterogeneous class, including on the one hand men of considerable\r\nwealth and position, and on the other mere cottagers. If we could trust\r\nthe statistics given above we should have to say that the latter\r\nenormously outnumbered the former. But our impression is that, though,\r\nno doubt, a large number of freeholders were extremely small men, the\r\npreponderance of the latter was not nearly so marked as is suggested by\r\nthe table. For one thing, it is difficult to reconcile it with the\r\naccounts given us of the substantial yeomen by the writers of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries. For another thing, it is in dealing\r\nwith the larger freeholders that the inclination of surveyors to omit\r\nany estimate of the extent of the land is strongest, because it is\r\nnaturally in their case that an estimate is most difficult to form.\r\nProbably, therefore, if we could obtain for the freehold tenancies\r\nfigures even as full as we can for those of the customary tenants, we\r\nshould find that the proportion holding between twenty and forty acres\r\nwas considerably larger than these partial statistics would suggest.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, though we very rarely have direct information as to\r\nthe proportion of their holdings used as arable, meadow, and pasture,\r\nsuch as is often supplied for other classes of tenants, we may say with\r\nsome confidence that it is extremely improbable that their agricultural\r\neconomy differed from that of the neighbouring copyholders,[75] and that\r\nthe backbone of their living, except when the plots were so small as\r\nmerely to supply them with garden produce, was therefore in almost every\r\ncase tillage. If in any way they departed from the practice of their\r\nneighbours who were not freeholders, they did so probably only in being\r\nsomewhat more alert and enterprising, somewhat more ready to use their\r\nsecurity to break with custom and to introduce innovations. It is clear\r\nthat many of them were very far from being tied down to the stagnant\r\nroutine which some writers would have us believe is inseparable from all\r\nsmall scale farming. Often, indeed, they had enough initiative to\r\nrealise the advantages of improved methods of cultivation, and on\r\nseveral manors of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the\r\nfreeholders agreed with each other to survey their lands and separate\r\nthem, so that they could be cultivated in severalty.[76] In many cases,\r\nagain, they extended their holdings, which were sometimes large and\r\nsometimes mere patches of a few acres, by acting as farmers for the lord\r\nof the manor and leasing[77] the demesne or part of it. Above all they\r\nhad nothing to fear from the agrarian changes which disturbed the\r\ncopyholder and the small tenant farmer, and a good deal to gain; for the\r\nrise in prices increased their incomes; while, unlike many copyholders\r\nand the tenant farmers, they could not be forced to pay more for their\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nTABLE II\r\n\r\n

The situation in our period is not like\r\nthat which arose in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, when\r\nwidening markets throw all the advantages of increasing returns on the\r\nside of the large wheat farmer, and the yeomanry sell their holdings to\r\ntry their fortunes in the rapidly growing towns. The struggle is not so\r\nmuch between the large scale and small scale production of corn as\r\nbetween corn growing and grazing. The small corn grower, provided he has\r\nsecurity of tenure, can still make a very good living.[78] From the\r\npoint of view of the economist all the smaller men, whether freeholders,\r\nleaseholders, or customary tenants, are in much the same position. The\r\ndecisive factor, which causes the fortunes of the former class to wax,\r\nand those of the two latter to wane, is to be found in the realm not of\r\neconomics but of law. Leaseholders and many copyholders suffer, because\r\nthey can be rack-rented and evicted. The freeholders stand firm, because\r\ntheir legal position is unassailable. Here, as so often elsewhere, not\r\nonly in the investigation of the past but in the analysis of the\r\npresent, the trail followed by the economist leads across a country\r\nwhose boundaries and contours and lines of least resistance have been\r\nfashioned by the labour of lawyers. It is his wisdom to recognise that\r\neconomic forces operate in a framework created by legal institutions,\r\nthat to neglect those institutions in examining the causes of economic\r\ndevelopment or the distribution of wealth is as though a geographer\r\nshould discuss the river system of a country without reference to its\r\nmountain ranges, and that, if lawyers have wrought in ignorance of\r\neconomics, he must nevertheless consult their own art in order to\r\nunravel the effect of their operations.\r\n\r\n    [78] See below, pp. 105?-115.\r\n\r\nFrom the larger standpoint of social and political organisation the\r\nfreeholders constituted an element in society the very nature of which\r\nwe can hardly understand, because our modern life offers no analogy to\r\nit. We tend to draw our social lines not between small properties and\r\ngreat, but between those who have property and those who have not, and\r\nto think of the men who stand between the very rich and the very poor,\r\nthe men of whom our ancestors boasted as the \"Commons of England,\" as\r\nmen who do not own but are employed by owners. Independence and the\r\nvirtues which go with independence, energy, a sober, self-respecting\r\nforethought, public spirit, are apt to become identified in our minds\r\nwith the possession of wealth, because so few except the comparatively\r\nwealthy have the means of climbing beyond the reach of the stream of\r\nimpersonal economic pressure which whirls the mass of mankind this way\r\nand that with the violence of an irresponsible Titan.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century was poor with a poverty which no industrial\r\ncommunity can understand, the poverty of the colonist and the peasant.\r\nIt lived in terror of floods and bad harvests and disease, of plague,\r\npestilence, and famine. If one may judge by its churchyards, it had an\r\ninfantile mortality which might make even Lancashire blush under its\r\nsoot. Yet (and we do not forget the black page of the early Poor Law) it\r\nwas possible for men who by our standards would be called poor to\r\nexercise that control over the conditions of their lives which is of the\r\nessence of freedom, and which in most modern communities is too\r\nexpensive a privilege to be enjoyed by more than comparatively few. Such\r\nmen were the freeholders. They formed a class which had security and\r\nindependence without having affluence, which spanned the gulf between\r\nthe wealthy and the humble with a chain of estates ranging from the few\r\nacres of the peasant proprietor to the many manors of the noble, which\r\nwas not too poor to be below public duties nor too rich to be above\r\nthem, which could feel that \"it is a quietness to a man's mind to dwell\r\nupon his owne and to know his heire certaine.\"[79] Look for a moment at\r\nthe jolly picture drawn by Fuller,[80] who wrote at the very end of the\r\nperiod with which we are dealing:--\r\n\r\n\"The good yeoman is a gentleman in ore whom the next age may see\r\nrefined, and is the most capable of genteel impressions when the Prince\r\nshall stamp.... France and Italy are like a die which has no points\r\nbetween cinque and ace, nobility and peasantry.... Indeed, Germany hath\r\nher boors like our yeomen; but by a tyrannical appropriation of nobility\r\nto some few ancient families their yeomen are excluded from ever rising\r\nhigher to clarify their blood. In England the temple of honour is closed\r\nto none who have passed through the temple of virtue.\r\n\r\n\"He wears russet clothes, but makes golden payment, having tin in his\r\nbuttons and silver in his pocket. He is the surest landmark whence\r\nforeigners may take aim of the ancient English customs, the gentry more\r\nfloating after foreign fashions.\r\n\r\n\"In his house he is bountiful both to strangers and poor people. Some\r\nhold, when hospitality died, she gave her last groan among the yeomen of\r\nKent. And still at our yeoman's table you shall have as many joints as\r\ndishes; no meat disguised with strange sauce; no straggling joint of a\r\nsheep in the midst of a pasture of grass, but solid, substantial food.\r\n\r\n\"He hath a great stroke in the making of a knight of the Shire. Good\r\nreason, for he makes a whole line in the subsidy book, where, whatsoever\r\nhe is rated, he payeth without regret, not caring how much his purse be\r\nlet blood, so it be done by the advice of the physicians of the state.\r\n\r\n\"In his own country he is a main man on juries; where, if the Judge open\r\nhis eyes on a matter of law, he needs not to be led by the nose in\r\nmatters of fact.... Otherwise (though not mutinous in a jury) he cares\r\nnot whom he displeaseth, so he pleaseth his own conscience.\r\n\r\n\"In a time of famine he is the Joseph of the country and keeps the poor\r\nfrom starving ... and to his poor neighbour abateth somewhat of the high\r\nprice of the market. The neighbour gentry court him for his\r\nacquaintance, which either he modestly waveth, or thankfully accepteth,\r\nbut in no way greedily desireth.\r\n\r\n\"In war, though he serveth on foot, he is ever mounted on a high spirit,\r\nas being a slave to none, and subject only to his own Prince. Innocence\r\nand independence make a brave spirit, whereas otherwise one must ask his\r\nleave to be valiant on whom one depends. Therefore if a state run up all\r\nto noblemen and gentlemen, so that the husbandmen be only mere\r\nlabourers or cottagers (which one calls but 'housed beggars'), it may\r\nhave good cavalry, but never good bands of foot.... Wherefore to make\r\ngood infantry it requireth men bred not in a servile or indigent\r\nfashion, but in some free and plentiful manner.\"\r\n\r\n    [79] Norden, _The Surveyor's Dialogue_.\r\n\r\n    [80] Fuller, _Holy and Profane State_. The concluding paragraph\r\n    is obviously copied from Bacon's _History of King Henry VII._\r\n\r\nThe ancestors of the yeomanry had suffered much in the anarchy of the\r\nfifteenth century, when the violent ejection of freeholders seems to\r\nhave become almost as common[81] as it had been in the evil days before\r\nthe reforms of Henry II. But the Tudor monarchy had put an end to that\r\nnightmare of lawlessness, and in any society governed by law this body\r\nof small property-owners was bound to be a powerful element, even though\r\nthey had no occasion for making any concerted use of their power, as\r\nduring the greater part of our period they had not. One must not, of\r\ncourse, exaggerate their importance, or forget that, though a special\r\ndignity was attached by opinion to all freeholders, they included in\r\nreality men of various economic positions. Many of them must have been\r\nquite poor. In the eastern counties, where they are most numerous, they\r\nfrequently own not more than three or four acres apiece, and can hardly,\r\none would suppose, have supported themselves without working for wages\r\nin addition to tilling their holdings. Nevertheless the part which they\r\nplayed in the routine of rural life was an indispensable one, and the\r\nvery diversity of the elements which they included made them a link\r\nbetween different ends of the social scale. It was from the more\r\nsubstantial among them that the government was most anxious to recruit\r\nthe military forces. The obligation of serving the State as voters and\r\nupon juries fell upon the 40s. freeholders. The security of their tenure\r\ncaused them to be the natural leaders of the peasantry in resisting\r\npressure from above. No efforts of Elizabeth's Government could induce\r\nthe yeomanry of the North[82] Riding to abandon the old religion; and\r\nwhen tenants and lords fall out over common rights and enclosures, it is\r\noften the freeholders--though on occasion they enclose themselves--who\r\nspeak[83] for the less independent classes and take the initiative in\r\ninstituting legal proceedings. The upward movement which went on among\r\nthis class in many parts of England meant a change in the distribution\r\nof material wealth which necessarily involved a corresponding change in\r\nthe balance of social forces and in the control of political power. To\r\nHarrington,[84] who sought in the seventeenth century to find in\r\neconomic causes an explanation of the revolution through which the\r\ncountry had passed, it seemed that the seeds of the civil war had been\r\nsown by the Tudor kings themselves in the care which they showed for the\r\nsmall proprietor. In destroying feudalism to establish the monarchy,\r\nthey had raised a power which was more dangerous to the monarchy than\r\nfeudalism itself. They had snapped the bond between landlord and tenant\r\nby the Statute of Retainers. They had given the tenant security by\r\nforbidding depopulation. Most important of all, by encouraging\r\nalienation they had caused an enormous transference of property from the\r\nupper to the middle and lower middle classes. \"The lands in possession\r\nof the Nobility and Clergy of England till Henry VII. cannot be\r\nestimated to have over-balanced those held by the People less than four\r\nto one. Whereas, in our days, the Clergy being destroyed, the Lands in\r\npossession of the People over-balance those held by the Nobility at\r\nleast nine in ten.\" But property is political power individualised and\r\nmade visible. The destruction of the monarchy was only the political\r\nexpression of an economic change which had begun in the reign of Henry\r\nVII. \"He suffered the balance to fall into the power of the people....\r\nBut the balance being in the People, the Commonwealth (though they do\r\nnot see it) is already in the nature of them.\" We need not accept\r\nHarrington's view in its entirety in order to appreciate the\r\nsignificance of the change which he describes. Certainly the yeomanry\r\nwere growing in political power, and were strong in that spirit of\r\nself-respect and pride in their order, which, when, as too often, it is\r\nconfined to a single class, means social oppression, but which, when\r\nwidely diffused throughout society, is the mother of public spirit and\r\npolitical virtue. The long discipline of tiresome public duties which\r\nthey had borne throughout the Middle Ages had formed them into a body\r\nwhich was alive to political issues and conscious of political\r\ninfluence, and which, when participation in public affairs became not\r\nonly a duty but a right, would use their power to press urgent petitions\r\nfrom one county after another upon the King and upon the Parliament, or\r\nby riding up from Buckinghamshire to protect Hampden at Westminster in\r\n1642, or by fighting behind Cromwell in Cambridgeshire, or by fighting\r\nfor the King in the West. Compared with the bulk of the population, they\r\nwere a privileged class and stood by their own; it was they who restored\r\nthe franchise to the 40s. freeholders in 1654 and refused to extend it\r\nto the copyholders. But the tenure of much of the land of England by men\r\nwith whom, however poor, no landlord or employer could interfere, set a\r\nlimit to the power of wealth, and made rural society at once more alert\r\nand more stubborn, a field where great ideas could grow and great causes\r\nfind adherents. Political and religious idealism flourish bravely in a\r\nstony soil.

As it was, they often left substantial fortunes to their\r\nchildren, and by the middle of the sixteenth century were already\r\nfollowing the examples of their social superiors in entailing[85] their\r\nlands. One can quite understand therefore that there is nothing\r\ninconsistent between the glowing accounts of their prosperity at the end\r\nof the century given by Harrison and his lamentation over the decline\r\nof the rural population, or between the well-attested sufferings of the\r\nsmall cultivator in the sixteenth century and his equally well-attested\r\nimportance in the seventeenth and early eighteenth. The explanation is\r\nthat the freeholders, though most important politically, did not form\r\nthe larger proportion of those substantial yeomen whose decay was\r\nlamented. The day of their ruin was to come. But for the next two\r\ncenturies they were safe enough, and, if anything, gained on the class\r\nimmediately above them, whose lands they bought or leased, into whose\r\nfamilies they married, and with whose children their own competed in the\r\nlearned professions, laying, as the historian of Suffolk[86] said, \"such\r\nstrong, sure and deep foundations that from thence in time are derived\r\nmany noble and worthy families.\" Nothing in the life of the period\r\ncaused more pride than the prosperity of this solid body of small\r\nproperty-owners, and the contrast which it offered to the downtrodden\r\npeasantry of the Continent. No loss has been sustained by the modern\r\nworld greater than their disappearance.\r\n\r\n    [85] It is stated by good authorities that between 12 Ed. IV.,\r\n    when the collusive action known as a common recovery used to\r\n    evade the Statute _de donis conditionalibus_ was confirmed by a\r\n    judicial decision (Taltarum's case), and the introduction into\r\n    settlements of \"Trustees to preserve contingent remainders\" by\r\n    Sir Orlando Bridgeman and Sir Geoffrey Palmer under the\r\n    Commonwealth, the tieing up of lands in one family was\r\n    impossible (_e.g._ Johnson, _The Disappearance of the Small\r\n    Landowner_, pp. 11-?13). But in 1538 Starkey's Dialogue speaks\r\n    strongly of the practice of entailing lands. \"This faute sprange\r\n    of a certayn arrogancy, whereby, wyth the entaylyng of landys,\r\n    every Jake would be a gentylman, and every gentylman a knight or\r\n    a lord\" (E. E. T. S., _England in the Reign of Henry VIII._,\r\n    Part II. pp. 112?-113, and pp. 195?-196.)\r\n\r\n    [86] Reyce, _Breviary of Suffolk_, p. 58, quoted _Victoria\r\n    County History, Suffolk_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) _The Customary Tenants_\r\n\r\nImportant, however, as the freeholders were from a social and political\r\nstandpoint, they were in most parts of England far inferior in point of\r\nnumbers to those described as \"customary tenants.\" It is with the latter\r\nclass that we are mainly concerned, and leaving the leaseholders on one\r\nside for examination later,[87] we may summarise shortly certain\r\nfeatures in their position. The number of customary tenants varied from\r\none manor to another, according to the extent to which in different\r\ndistricts farmers holding by lease had been substituted for them, and on\r\nsome by the middle of the sixteenth century there were none at all. But\r\nthere are many indications that, down to the end of that century at any\r\nrate, and probably much longer, they formed over the great part of\r\nEngland the bulk of the landholding population. Of the revenues of 74\r\nmanors held by monastic[88] houses in 1535, £116 came from free, and\r\n£1310 from customary, tenants. On 81 of the 118 manors analysed above\r\nthey are the most numerous class. When all the different districts are\r\ngrouped together, they amount to about 61 per cent. of all landholders,\r\nand even this figure does not give an adequate idea of their numerical\r\nimportance. As we have seen, Norfolk and Suffolk are quite peculiar in\r\nthe multitude of freeholders they embrace, while the large number of\r\nleaseholders on one extensive Lancashire manor unduly weights the\r\nfigures for that county. On the Midland manors 62 per cent., in\r\nWiltshire, Devonshire, and Somerset 77 per cent., in Northumberland 91\r\nper cent. of all those holding land are customary tenants. No doubt the\r\narea of land held under lease was growing in the course of the\r\nsixteenth, and still more in the course of the seventeenth, century, and\r\nits growth is an extremely important movement, of which something will\r\nbe said later. But it seems true to say that, down to the end of the\r\nsixteenth century, both in numbers and payments, though not in prestige\r\nand influence, the customary tenants, as distinct from the freeholders\r\nand leaseholders, were by far the most important class in the\r\nagricultural life of the country.\r\n\r\n    [87] See below, pp. 200?-213 and 283?-287.\r\n\r\n    [88] _Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History_, vol. i.\r\n    Savine, _English Monasteries on the Eve of the Dissolution_, pp.\r\n    156?-159.\r\n\r\nAmong the customary tenants, however, there are certain important\r\nsubdivisions. There are in the first place, differences of legal status.\r\nThough villeinage by blood had been disappearing rapidly for several\r\ngenerations, partly through manumission on payment of a fine to the\r\nlord, partly through the absorption of migrating villeins into the\r\ngrowing industries of the towns, a certain number of villeins by blood\r\nlingered on into the sixteenth century. Dr. Savine[89] has estimated\r\nthat there were at least as many as 500 villein families in 1485, and as\r\nmany as 250 in the reign of Elizabeth; and the fact that they occur\r\noccasionally on our Norfolk[90] manors, and rather more often on those\r\nin Wiltshire[91] and Somersetshire, suggests that his list could be\r\nconsiderably extended on further investigation. Even in 1561 a borough\r\nsurrenders an apprentice on the ground that he is a runaway villein.[92]\r\nEven in 1568 it is worth while in leasing[93] a manor to a farmer for\r\nthe lord to reserve to himself the villeins upon it, together with other\r\nforms of property like quarries and advowsons.\r\n\r\n    [89] _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, vol. xvii.\r\n\r\n    [90] R.O. _Misc. Bks. Land Rev._, vol. 220, fol. 220, Brisingham\r\n    (Norfolk) 1589: \"Alice Bartram, the widow of W. Bartram, the\r\n    lord's villain by blood, took by surrender of said William for\r\n    term of life on 4 Feby., remainder to Roger Bartram, lord's\r\n    villain by blood.\" Holkham MSS., Titleshall Documents, Terrier\r\n    of Godwick, 1508: \"Also five roods of the Prior in the hands of\r\n    Thomas Frend, native.\"\r\n\r\n    [91] Among the 742 customary tenants on the manors belonging to\r\n    the Earl of Pembroke surveyed in 1568 there appears to be 7\r\n    _nativi domini, i.e._ villeins by blood, viz., 1 at Washerne\r\n    (Wilts), 2 at Stooke Trister and Cucklington (Somerset), 4 at\r\n    Chedeseye (Somerset), of whom one has been manumitted.\r\n\r\n    [92] _Selected Records of Norwich_ (Tingey), vol. vi. p. 180:\r\n    \"Robert Ryngwoode brought in a certain indenture wherein Lewis\r\n    Lowth was [bound] to hym to serve as a prentys for seven years.\r\n    And Mr. John Holdiche cam before the Mayor and other Justices\r\n    and declared that the said Lewis is a bondman to my lord of\r\n    Norfolk's Grace, and further that he was brought up in husbandry\r\n    untyl he was xx year old. Whereupon he was discharged of his\r\n    service.\"\r\n\r\n    Note the way in which Statute law is used to compel the\r\n    agricultural labour which the vanishing jurisdiction of lord\r\n    over serf is ceasing to be able to enforce.\r\n\r\n    [93] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Manors of William, First Earl\r\n    of Pembroke_, Manor of Chilmerke: \"Johannes Reve tenet per\r\n    indenturam totum illud capitale messuagium excepta et omnino\r\n    reservata omnia wardas, maritagia fines ... nativos,\" &c.\r\n\r\nOne cannot, therefore, take the almost sanctimonious abhorrence of\r\nbondage expressed by the writers of the period quite at its face value.\r\nOn the other hand, though villeinage by blood was still worth recording,\r\nsince it offered an impecunious lord an opportunity for arbitrary\r\ntaxation, and still sufficiently irksome for the rebels under Ket[94]\r\n(influenced perhaps by some dim memory of the German peasants'\r\nprogramme) to set its abolition among their demands, its practical\r\nimportance was slight, and it was quite compatible with a good deal of\r\nprosperity on the part of those who were legally bondmen. How completely\r\nout of date it was by the middle of the sixteenth century is best shown\r\nby some of the cases in which attempts were made to enforce it. When the\r\nEarl of Bath[95] seizes £400 from a family on the ground that the\r\nmembers are his villeins, and is pursued by them for nine years from\r\none court to another, or when a lord[96] of a manor is compelled by a\r\nroyal commission appointed for the purpose of investigating the matter,\r\nto repay the value of the beast taken from a man who is proved by the\r\ncourt rolls to be his villein, and the latter, having received it back,\r\ndeclines to stop proceedings unless he be paid heavy compensation in\r\naddition, one must see rather a proof of the practical disappearance of\r\nvilleinage than of its survival. Its occasional enforcement is clearly\r\nregarded as something outrageous; it is a freak of arbitrary despotism,\r\nwhich has hardly more historical significance than the seizure of the\r\nDerby winner as a copyhold heriot would have at the present day. Public\r\nopinion, even the opinion of those engaged in estate management,\r\ncondemns such attempts unreservedly, and when they come to the ears of\r\nthe authorities they strain the law on the side of the bondmen.\r\n\r\n    [94] Russell, _Ket's Rebellion in Norfolk_, p. 49: \"We pray that\r\n    all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with his\r\n    precious blood shedding.\" The German peasants in the articles\r\n    drawn up at Memmingen in 1525 demanded the abolition of serfdom\r\n    \"since Christ hath purchased and redeemed us all with his\r\n    precious blood.\" The Christian appeal is a common one; see\r\n    below.\r\n\r\n    [95] Selden Society, _Select Cases in the Court of Requests_,\r\n    John Burde and another v.

Mr. Leadam's remarks (int.\r\n    cxxix.) show that a man who was legally a villein might be\r\n    economically very prosperous: \"Thomas Carter ... was charged 40\r\n    marks for his enfranchisement. He kept a man-servant. He rode on\r\n    horseback. He gave a feast to celebrate his freedom. He was even\r\n    on friendly terms with the gentlemen of the Abbot's household.\"\r\n    See also Savine, _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, vol. xvii. Lord\r\n    Stafford actually tried to seize the Mayor of Bristol and his\r\n    brother as bondmen!\r\n\r\nThis change from servile to free labour, begun some two centuries\r\nbefore, and virtually completed in the reign of Elizabeth, is a high\r\nlandmark in the development both of economic and political society. It\r\nis a long step towards modern industrialism on the one hand and the\r\nmodern all-inclusive state on the other. By sapping the organisation of\r\nsociety on the basis of tenure, and thus making room for the more\r\nelastic relationships of the wage-contract, it prepared the way for new\r\nmethods of production and for the growth of new centres of economic\r\npower. The refusal of the courts to allow that the lord of a manor had,\r\n_qua_ lord, a theoretical right to dispose of the persons and chattels\r\nof his unfree tenants, meant the final triumph of the common law in\r\nregions with which for four centuries after the Norman Conquest it had\r\nnot dared to interfere. Henceforward, while the German peasant is driven\r\nafield to gather snails and wild strawberries for his lord, is plundered\r\nand harried and tortured without hope of redress, his English brother\r\nis a member of a society in which there is, nominally at least, one law\r\nfor all men. His liberty may be more in shadow than in substance, yet\r\nthe shadow is itself an earnest of greater things. To us who know the\r\nmisery of many of the poorer classes in the sixteenth century the boast\r\nthat \"if any slaves or bondmen come here from other realms, so soon as\r\nthey set foot on land they became so free of condition as their\r\nmasters,\" may read like a bitter mockery. But it is something that the\r\nboast should be made, and when England is confronted with the greatest\r\nmoral issue of the modern world, that boast will stand her in good\r\nstead.[97] She owes some acknowledgment to the nameless serfs who fled\r\nfrom farm and homestead, till villeinage, in spite of the law, bled\r\ngradually to death.\r\n\r\n    [97] Hargreave's speech in Somersett's case (1771-1772, Howell,\r\n    _State Trials_, xx.) is based largely on precedents drawn from\r\n    villeinage: \"Though villeinage itself is obsolete ... those\r\n    rules, by which the claim of it was regulated, are not yet\r\n    buried in oblivion.... By a strange progress of human affairs\r\n    the memory of slavery expired now furnishes one of the chief\r\n    obstacles to slavery attempted to be revived.... The law of\r\n    England, then, excludes every slavery not commencing in England,\r\n    every slavery, though commencing there, not being ancient and\r\n    immemorial. Villeinage is the only slavery which can possibly\r\n    answer to such a description, and that has long expired by the\r\n    death or emancipation of all those who were once the objects of\r\n    it. Consequently there is now no slavery which can be lawful in\r\n    England.\"\r\n\r\nHaving said so much we must hasten to guard ourselves, by adding that\r\nthe final disappearance of serfdom in this country neither involved any\r\nradical conversion of opinion, nor prevented the classes who depended\r\nsolely on their labour from being, on occasion, cruelly oppressed. It\r\nwould be a mistake to see in the attitude of the governing classes\r\ntowards villeinage a symptom of humanitarian feeling for the rights of a\r\nhelpless class, such as prompted the emancipation movement of the last\r\ncentury. How little humanitarianism influenced economic policy in\r\nrelation to those who were too powerless to be dangerous, is shown by\r\nthe sanguinary statutes relating to the destitute, and in particular by\r\nthe extraordinary legalisation of slavery in the Act[98] of 1547, by\r\nwhich a confirmed vagrant might, when captured, be made a bondman for\r\nlife. Nor must we think of the disappearance of legalised serfdom as\r\neffecting a great improvement in the lot of the ordinary wage-worker.\r\nThose who benefited by it were not so much the workers for wages, as the\r\nlandholding peasants. The wage-labourer, who was tied to his parish by\r\nthe Statute of Artificers almost as completely as the serf had been by\r\nthe custom of the manor, can hardly have seen much difference between\r\nthe restrictions on his movement imposed by the Justices of the Peace\r\nand those laid on him by the manorial authorities, except indeed that\r\nthe latter, being limited to the area of a single village, had been more\r\neasy to evade.\r\n\r\n    [98] 1 Ed. VI., c. 3. Possibly, however, the penalty of bondage\r\n    was regarded as a step towards greater leniency, as the\r\n    punishment of \"incorrigible rogues\" had hitherto been death.\r\n\r\nEven if we confine our attention to the landholding peasants, to whom\r\nthe advantage (for they were quick to seize it) was certainly real\r\nenough, we may doubt whether they did not lose almost as much by the\r\nintrusion into agriculture of competitive commercial forces as they\r\ngained by the final disappearance of a claim which had always been held\r\nin check by the custom of the manor, and which, since the ravages of the\r\nGreat Plague, had been steadily circumscribed by commutation. The truth\r\nis that the sharp antithesis drawn by modern commercial societies\r\nbetween serfs and the free labourers on whose slowly straightening backs\r\nour civilisation is uneasily poised, and emphasised as though it marked\r\na line between hopeless oppression and unqualified liberty, requires to\r\nbe supplemented by categories derived from a wider and more tragic range\r\nof experience than was open to our forefathers. There are more ways of\r\nliving \"at the will of a lord\" than were known to Glanvill and Bracton,\r\nand the utility of the contrast in the sphere of legal analysis does not\r\nsave it from being but a thin abstraction of the countless forms of\r\ntyranny which spring from the world-old power of one human being to use\r\nanother as his tool. That dependence on the uncontrolled caprice of a\r\nmaster whom one hates to obey and dare not abandon, which, by whatever\r\ndraperies it may be veiled, is still the bitter core of serfdom,[99] is\r\ncompatible with the most diverse legal arrangements; with wage labour\r\nas with forced services, with tenure by a competitive money rent as well\r\nas with tenure by personal obligations, with freedom of contract as well\r\nas with inherited status, with protection by the national courts as well\r\nas with its absence.\r\n\r\n    [99] More's remarks on the lot of the wage-workers of his day\r\n    have a refreshing note of reality. The Utopians are \"not to be\r\n    wearied from earlie in the morning to late in the evenninge with\r\n    continuall worke, like labouringe and toylinge beastes. For this\r\n    is worse then the miserable and wretched condition of bondemen.\r\n    Whiche nevertheless is almooste everywhere the lyfe of workemen\r\n    and artificers, saving in Utopia\" (More, _Utopia_, Pitt Press\r\n    Edition, pp. 79?-80).\r\n\r\nWhen we turn over the pages in which the writers of the sixteenth\r\ncentury declare that bondage is contrary to \"the Christian religion\r\nwhich maketh us all in Christ breathren, and in respect of God and\r\nChrist _conservos_,\"[100] and congratulate themselves on its\r\ndisappearance, we must not doubt their sincerity, but we may envy their\r\ninexperience. We must remember that a condemnation of villeinage was\r\nquite compatible with a policy of great severity towards the\r\nwage-labourer, and was in fact not unconnected with it, since the latter\r\nhad almost everywhere stepped into places and functions formally held by\r\nthe bondman. Villeinage disappeared in England earlier than on the\r\ncontinent of Europe, not for the ethical reasons given by Fitzherbert\r\nand Smith and Norden, but because the growth of a commercial\r\norganisation of agriculture had made its maintenance both useless and\r\nimpossible. The intellectual conversion did little more than follow on\r\nthe economic change to make a virtue of necessity. The personal\r\nrightlessness of the villein and the hateful incidents of villeinage,\r\nsuch as chevage, merchet, and leyrwite, had had their utility in the\r\nfact that they kept him at the disposal of the manorial authorities as\r\nan instrument of agriculture. With the substitution of hired labour for\r\nthe cultivation of the demesne by the services of bond tenants, their\r\nmaintenance lost its attractiveness. No employer wants to retain a\r\npermanent staff, if there are \"hands\" whom he can take on and put off at\r\npleasure. Villeinage ceases but the Poor Laws begin.\r\n\r\n    [100] Smith, _De Republica Anglorum_, Lib. III., ch. 8. See also\r\n    Fitzherbert, _Surveying_ (1539): \"How be it, in some places the\r\n    bondmen continue as yet, the which me seemeth is the greatest\r\n    inconvenience that now is suffered by the law.\" Norden, _The\r\n    Surveyor's Dialogue_ (1608): \"Which kinde of service and\r\n    slavery, thanks be to God, is in most places of this Realme\r\n    quite abolished and worne out of memory.... Truly I think it is\r\n    a Christian parte so to do [_i.e._ manumit bondsmen], for seeing\r\n    we be nowe all as the children of one father, the servants of\r\n    one God, and the subjects of one king, it is very uncharitable\r\n    to retain our brethren in bondage, sith, when we were all bond,\r\n    Christ did make us free.\"\r\n\r\nMuch more important than this difference of legal status are\r\ndifferences in the tenure by which customary tenants hold their lands.\r\nUnder the name of customary tenants are grouped together all holders of\r\nlands which pass by surrender and admission in the court of the manor,\r\nand which are subject to the custom of the manor as evidenced by the\r\nrecords of the court. But not all these lands are held by exactly the\r\nsame title. Some are held by copy of court roll according to the custom\r\nof the manor, on the terms set out on a copy of the entry of admission.\r\nOthers are held without a documentary title, and are often said to be\r\noccupied at the will of the lord, or at the pleasure of the lord, or by\r\ngrant or permission of the lord or of the court, their essential feature\r\nbeing that the tenant does not possess any instrument recording the\r\ntransaction, but has, if necessary, to appeal to the records of the\r\ncourt or even to its mere memory.\r\n\r\nOne must hasten to add, however, that these classes are not mutually\r\nexclusive. A copyholder is a tenant at will, though qualified by the\r\naddition of the words \"by copy of court roll according to the custom of\r\nthe manor.\" It not seldom happens that in rentals and surveys he is\r\nsimply described as a tenant at will, and that the fact that he has a\r\ncopy is not recorded. A tenant at will is usually (though not always) a\r\ncustomary tenant, and, when he is, he can appeal to the custom with as\r\ngood a right as a copyholder, though of course the fact that his title\r\nis not in his own keeping may prejudice him if the manorial authorities\r\nwant to get rid of him. \"All[101] copyhold land,\" it was said, \"is\r\ncommonly customary, but all customary land is not copyhold,\" and one may\r\naccept the statement with the reservation that \"commonly\" must not be\r\ntaken to mean \"always,\" for it is quite usual in parts of England for\r\nland which by no stretch of imagination can be called customary land,\r\nfor example, part of the lord's demesne, to be let by copy of court\r\nroll. The fact that \"tenant at will\" was sometimes used as a compendious\r\nphrase for \"copyholder,\" and that both are sometimes described simply as\r\n\"customary tenants\" without further definitions, makes it impossible to\r\noffer any accurate estimate of the relative number of those holding by\r\ncopy and those holding at will. It may, however, be of interest to give\r\nan analysis of the entries as they appear in a group of manorial\r\ndocuments. It is as follows[102]:--\r\n\r\nTABLE III\r\n\r\n\r\n    +------------------------------+-----+---------+----------+----------+\r\n    |                              |Total| \"Copy-  |\"Customary|\"Tenants  |\r\n    |                              |     |holders.\"| Tenants.\"| at Will.\"|\r\n    +------------------------------+-----+---------+----------+----------+\r\n    |                              |     |         |          |          |\r\n    |Northumberland                | 436 |   362   |     45   |     29   |\r\n    |Lancashire                    | 451 |   295   |    156   |    ...   |\r\n    |Staffordshire                 | 272 |   170   |    ...   |    102   |\r\n    |Leicestershire                | 311 |   157   |    ...   |    154   |\r\n    |Northamptonshire              | 355 |   253   |    931   |     91   |\r\n    |Norfolk                       | 596 |   536   |     45   |     15   |\r\n    |Suffolk                       | 146 |    53   |     82   |     11   |\r\n    |Wilts and Somerset            | 817 |   786   |    ...   |     31   |\r\n    |Hampshire                     | 251 |   251   |    ...   |    ...   |\r\n    |Ten other manors in the south |     |         |          |          |\r\n    |  of England                  | 158 |    87   |     45   |     26   |\r\n    +------------------------------+-----+---------+----------+----------+\r\n    |     Total                    |3793 |  2950   |    466   |    377   |\r\n    +------------------------------+-----+---------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n\r\n    [101] Norden, _The Surveyor's Dialogue_. He continues: \"For in\r\n    some places of this Realme Tennants have no copies at all of\r\n    their lands or tenements, or anything to show for that they\r\n    hold, but there is an entry made in the Court Books, and that is\r\n    their evidence.\"\r\n\r\n    [102] See Appendix II.\r\n\r\nThese figures, one must repeat, are merely a summary of the entries in\r\nsurveys and rentals. Probably they underestimate the number of\r\ncopyholders, as we know that copyholders were sometimes entered as\r\ntenants at will or as customary tenants for the sake of brevity, while\r\nit is not probable that tenants at will who had not got copies were\r\noften written down as copyholders. One may suspect that this, rather\r\nthan any difference of custom, is the explanation of the relatively\r\nsmall number of those who are returned as copyholders in Lancashire,\r\nStaffordshire, Leicestershire, and Suffolk. Still, these figures do show\r\nthe enormous preponderance of copyholders among the customary tenants,\r\nand show it all the more certainly if the number of copyholders is to be\r\ntaken, as is probable, as the minimum. And this agrees with what we know\r\nfrom the incidental references of the writers of the time. Of 1000\r\ntenants on the great ecclesiastical manor of Scrooby in Nottinghamshire\r\n\"the most part\" were said by Archbishop[103] Sandys in 1582 to be\r\ncopyholders. Harrison[104] in 1587 spoke of copyholders as those \"by\r\nwhom the greatest part of the realm doth stand and is maintained.\" At\r\nthe beginning of the seventeenth century Coke[105] could say that the\r\nthird part of England consisted of copyhold. Copyholders, it is true,\r\nare far from being all of one type; for the essence of their tenure is\r\nthat it depends on the custom of the manor which varies from place to\r\nplace, and when we come to consider how far they have security against\r\neviction these differences are of crucial importance. Still, in spite of\r\nthe varieties of copyhold tenure, it is useful to know that to the bulk\r\nof the population in the sixteenth century landholding meant holding by\r\ncopy of court roll according to the custom of the manor. No account of\r\nthe agrarian changes can stand for a moment which does not give full\r\nweight to the fact that, in most parts of England, the copyholders\r\ngreatly outnumber all other classes of tenants.\r\n\r\n    [103] Archbishop Sandys to Queen Elizabeth, Saturday 24 November\r\n    to 4 December, 1582 (quoted by E. Arber, _The Story of the\r\n    Pilgrim Fathers_, pp. 61-?64).\r\n\r\n    [104] Harrison in _Elizabethan England_ (Withington), p. 120.\r\n\r\n    [105] Quoted by Nasse, _The Land Community of the Middle Ages_\r\n    (Ouvry's trans.). I have not been able to trace the reference.\r\n\r\nThe numerical predominance of the customary tenants and among those of\r\nthe copyholders, together with the disastrous effects upon them which\r\nare ascribed by most of our authorities to the agrarian changes of the\r\nsixteenth century, makes a somewhat detailed examination of their\r\nposition essential. In particular it is important to try to bridge the\r\ngap between the agricultural system of the sixteenth and that of the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries, out of which it emerged, and of\r\nwhich it continued to bear unmistakable traces. The problem is really a\r\ntwofold one, partly legal and partly economic. First, what was the legal\r\nnature of copyhold tenure, and how did it arise out of mediæval\r\nvilleinage? Secondly, there is the question, which for us is more\r\nimportant, of the type of agriculture which prevailed among the mass of\r\nthe people. The economist wants to know whether the customary tenants\r\nwere large cultivators or small, whether they included considerable\r\ncapitalists and mere cottagers or whether their holdings were of a\r\nfairly uniform pattern, whether they farmed mainly for subsistence or\r\nfor the market, whether they lived entirely by tillage or were pasture\r\nfarmers as well, whether they were tied down by custom or showed any\r\nsigns of being influenced by the agricultural innovations of our period.\r\n\r\nOf these two questions the first has been investigated much more\r\nthoroughly than the second. We shall return to it later in considering\r\nhow far the copyholder had security of tenure, and enjoyed legal\r\nprotection against the lord who wished to evict him. But we may say at\r\nonce that we accept in substance the argument of those who hold that\r\nmost copyholders are the descendants of villeins holding villein land,\r\nthat copyhold tenure is, in fact, villein tenure to which the courts\r\nfrom the end of the fourteenth century have gradually extended their\r\nprotection, and that the puzzling differences between the position of\r\none group of copyholders and another are due to differences in manorial\r\ncustom which were followed and upheld by the courts. This not only is\r\nthe traditional view, in the sense of being that which is implied in the\r\ninsistence of contemporaries that copyhold originated in base tenure,\r\nand that copyholders were tenants \"whom the favourable hand of time hath\r\nmuch enfranchised,\"[106] but also seems to be that which best fits the\r\nsituation of the copyholder as we find it in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n    [106] Norden, _The Surveyor's Dialogue_.\r\n\r\nThis line of development is suggested, though it is not proved, by the\r\nmere preponderance of copyholders. In looking for the antecedents of so\r\nnumerous and widely spread a class we can only find them in the tenure\r\nof the mass of the people in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,\r\nthat is in villein tenure. Further, we do not find in villein tenure any\r\nsuch fundamental distinction between customary tenure which was\r\nprotected and base tenure which was not, as has been sometimes\r\npostulated as an explanation of the qualified legal security possessed\r\nby copyholders 200 years later. On the contrary, the tenure of the\r\nvilleins is marked by the same variety of customary conditions as\r\nappears in that of the copyholders, with the difference that, when once\r\ncopyhold has taken root, these customs are enforced by the courts. The\r\nsame conclusion is borne out by the survival of ancient formulæ among\r\nthe terms by which the conditions of the copyholders are recorded in\r\nthe surveys. It is quite common for copyholders in the sixteenth century\r\nto be described as occupying \"bond\"[107] or \"native\" land; sometimes one\r\nfinds a whole list of them set down under the rubric \"holding[108]\r\nnative lands by copy of court roll.\" The last thing, of course, which\r\noccurred to the writer of these entries was any legal theory as to the\r\norigin of copyhold tenure. All he was concerned to do was to describe\r\nthe holdings in the way which was most precise and left least room for\r\npossible disputes. Clearly, he must have had it in his mind that lands\r\nwhich in his day were let by copy of court roll were lands which were\r\nknown generally in the village as bond lands, and which in earlier\r\ndocuments were described as being occupied in villeinage.\r\n\r\n    [107] _E.g._, R.O. Rentals and Surveys Gen. Ser., Portf. 27, No.\r\n    32, Dunstall (Suffolk): \"Bond land held by copy of court roll,\r\n    13s. 4d. Of holders of 3 bond pightells, 5s. 4d.\" MSS. of Earl\r\n    of Leicester at Holkham, Tittleshall Books, No. 62, Langham Hall\r\n    (Norfolk): \"Redditus assissæ native tenentium. ... John Rose per\r\n    copiam, 4d.\" R.O. Rentals and Surveys Gen. Ser. Portf. 14, No.\r\n    70, Barton (Staffs.): \"T. Collinson 1 messuage 1/4 virgate land\r\n    de bond ... by copy 2 Hen. viii.\"\r\n\r\n    [108] MSS. of Earl of Leicester at Holkham, Billingford and\r\n    Bintry MSS., No. 9, Foxley: \"Native tenentium per copiam rotuli\r\n    curiæ.\"\r\n\r\nOne may approach the question in another way, by looking at the\r\ncircumstances of those exceptional manors on which the tenants at will\r\nare more numerous than the copyholders, and which are instructive just\r\nbecause they represent a variation from the general type. A case in\r\npoint is the Manor of Knyghton in Wiltshire. On the majority of the\r\nmanors held in that county by the Earl of Pembroke the copyholders are\r\nfar the most numerous class, and on some they are the only class, among\r\nthe customary tenants. At Knyghton,[109] however, there are no\r\ncopyholders; all the customary tenants hold at the will of the lord, and\r\nwhen one examines the position and methods of agriculture more closely,\r\none finds that they display several signs of being in other respects\r\nmore antiquated and conservative than is the case in other parts of the\r\nsame country; for example, all the holdings are either virgates of\r\ntwenty-four acres or some fraction and multiple of a virgate, which is\r\nnot at all common on other Wiltshire manors, and implies an unusual\r\napproximation to the conditions of the peasantry two centuries before.\r\nIs it unreasonable to conclude that this is a case of arrested\r\ndevelopment, and that Knyghton is a manor on which the tenants at will\r\nhave never turned into copyholders, because for one reason or another it\r\nhas lain outside the main stream of agricultural development?\r\n\r\n    [109] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Manors of William, First Earl\r\n    of Pembroke_.\r\n\r\nThe connection with copyhold tenure of some of the characteristic\r\nobligations and disabilities of villeinage points in the same direction.\r\nIn spite of the general commutation of services into money payments,\r\nwhich Mr. Page's statistics show to have taken place before the middle\r\nof the fifteenth century, one still finds the attenuated records of\r\nlabour rents surviving for many generations after the direct management\r\nof the demesne by manorial officials has been abandoned, and passing\r\nwith the rest of the farm equipment to the farmer who takes it on lease.\r\nIn Norfolk and Suffolk they seem indeed to have disappeared almost\r\naltogether, which is what one would expect in view of the fact that\r\nthose counties were the Lancashire and West Riding of the period, and no\r\ndoubt, even when labour services were still exacted, the farmer relied\r\nmainly upon hired labour. But it would be a mistake to regard the\r\ntenants' works as everywhere so trifling as to be of no economic\r\nimportance. Often, it is true, they are inconsiderable. At South\r\nNewton,[110] for example, though the uncertainty which had been one of\r\nthe marks of villeinage still survived among the copyholders in the\r\nshape of the duty of \"gift carriage,\" the transport of such timber as\r\nwas wanted to the lord's house at Wilton, the purely agricultural\r\nservices were unimportant, and the tenants of every yardland had only to\r\nmow the farmer's meadow and to carry his hay. At Cuxham,[111] in\r\nOxfordshire, on the other hand, the authorities were still getting\r\ntwenty-eight boonworks in autumn from the copyholders at the end of the\r\nfifteenth century. On a Northumbrian[112] manor belonging to Tynemouth\r\nPriory down to the dissolution of the monasteries \"every tenant did lead\r\nto the castle in the prior's time one load of hay, mow three several\r\ndayworks of hay, rake one daywork and sheare three severall dayworks in\r\nthe corn in harvest every year.\" At Washerne,[113] in Wiltshire, the\r\ncopyhold tenants' labours were in 1568 still quite an important affair:\r\neach holder of one virgate of twenty acres \"shall plough three half\r\nacres for the lord's winter seed and shall harrow them, and also the\r\naforesaid tenants shall wash and shear the lord's sheep ... and further\r\neach of them shall mow one acre of meadow ... and gather hay thence and\r\nprepare it.... Each of the said tenants shall reap one acre of wheat and\r\nhe must bind the crop and carry it. Also each of them shall reap one\r\nacre of barley.\" On a Lancashire[114] manor in 1628 every plough hand is\r\nobliged to do two days' work in the year with a team on the demesne, and\r\ntwo days with a labourer. Such elaborate obligations as appears at\r\nWasherne are, it is true, the exception. But they show that in the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century there were still backwaters where the\r\nremnants of agricultural services were a not inconsiderable burden; and\r\nif their comparative lightness marks the progress from villeinage to a\r\nwage system, their survival as clearly shows that villeinage was the pit\r\nfrom which copyhold tenure was digged.\r\n\r\n    [110] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Manors of William, First Earl\r\n    of Pembroke_.\r\n\r\n    [111] Merton Documents, 5902.\r\n\r\n    [112] _Northumberland County History_, vol. viii., p. 220 (one\r\n    may add that in parts of Northumberland the labourers are still\r\n    called \"bondagers\"; Mr. Clay tells me that in the Calder valley\r\n    farmers still use \"daywork\" as a unit for measuring fields). See\r\n    also _Calendar of Proceedings in Chancery, temp. Eliz._, D. d.\r\n    2, 44, for a suit by a farmer to recover services due from\r\n    tenants.\r\n\r\n    [113] Pembroke Surveys.\r\n\r\n    [114] _Chetham Society Miscellanies_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\nMore striking still, perhaps, is the persistence of disabilities of\r\nanother kind. The old marks of personal bondage, chevage, merchet,\r\nleyrwite, liability to tallage, and the rest have almost disappeared.\r\nBut traces of them are still found clinging to the copyhold tenants.\r\nCopyholders pay a fixed sum to be free of tallages.[115] They pay salt\r\nsilver instead of the salt with which they had once been obliged to toil\r\nto the lord's manor-house; they are forced to act as the lord's reeve,\r\nand collect his rents, heriots, and strays. In one curious instance one\r\nfinds something very like a tallage[116] being taken at the beginning\r\nof the seventeenth century, though of course that is not what it is\r\ncalled. The tenants are simply collected and told that they must help\r\nthe lord to pay for an estate which he has bought, by giving him three\r\nyears' rent apiece, that, if they do, no more gifts will be demanded\r\nduring his lifetime, and that, if they do not, he will refuse to renew\r\nholdings as they fall in. Even merchet, the most hateful of all the\r\nincidents of villeinage, is something more than a mere memory. As late\r\nas 1620 the tenants of Holt[117] in Denbighshire thought it worth while\r\nto point out to the crown surveyor that \"they are freed from payment of\r\nany sum of money upon the marriage of their daughters,\" and even in 1654\r\nLeyrwite and childwite were still being paid by the heiresses of\r\ncopyhold tenants on some of the Warwickshire[118] manors.\r\n\r\n    [115] Pembroke Surveys, Estoverton and Phipheld: \"Tenentes de\r\n    Estoverton reddunt annuatim pro pannagio et tallagio ... ivs.\"\r\n    For salt silver, _ibid._, South Newton. For liability to serve\r\n    as Reeve, _ibid._, Paynton.\r\n\r\n    [116] _Chetham Society Miscellanies_, vol. iii.: \"I would wish\r\n    you to call the tenants first all together and to signify unto\r\n    them that my father and I have gone through with Mr. Ireland for\r\n    Warrington, and the summe we are to give is above £7000; and\r\n    this was done making no doubt that towards it every one of them\r\n    being tenants would by their assistance enable us to finish\r\n    it.... If they faile in this, they may provoke us to sharp\r\n    courses, especially mee, who have had a purpose to take the\r\n    third part of every living as it falls.\"\r\n\r\n    [117] Wrexham Free Library, _Ancient Local Records_, vol. ii.\r\n    MS. transcript by A.N. Palmer, \"Survey of the Town and Liberty\r\n    of Holt.\"\r\n\r\n    [118] Savine, _Quarterly Journal of Economics_, vol. xix.\r\n\r\nIt will not, therefore, be surprising to find that the humble origin of\r\ncopyhold tenure has left marks upon it in other ways as well, and, in\r\nparticular, that though the copyholder is not without legal protection\r\nwhen the lord tries to get rid of him, that protection is often of a\r\nsomewhat shadowy and ineffective kind. His title is a customary one, and\r\nmighty as custom still is, it has for centuries been growing gradually\r\nweaker. Its weakening is at once an advantage and a disadvantage to the\r\npeasantry. It relieves them of odious obligations and leaves them\r\ngreater room to push their fortunes. It lowers a protecting barrier and\r\nexposes them to the dissolving forces of competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PEASANTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) _The Variety of Conditions_\r\n\r\nWhen one turns from what legal historians have said on the origin and\r\ndevelopment of copyhold tenure to consider the economic position of this\r\nclass of tenants, one finds oneself in a region of much greater\r\nuncertainty. The legal historian may speak of the copyholders as\r\nconstituting, in spite of minor differences, a fairly well-defined\r\nclass. The economic historian cannot. He finds, on the contrary, the\r\nwidest difference between the economic conditions of tenants holding\r\ntheir land by copy of court roll, not only, as would be expected, in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, but on the same manor. In the thirteenth\r\ncentury to say that a man is a villein tells us something at least about\r\nhis economic position, at any rate when the general features of the\r\nmanor on which he is a villein are known. He will probably have a\r\nstandard holding of a virgate or half-virgate; he will have rights in\r\nthe common meadow land and in the common waste; he will do work on the\r\nlord's demesne. In the sixteenth century tenure is no clue to economic\r\nstatus, and to say that a man is a copyhold tenant tells us nothing at\r\nall about the extent of his holding or the sort of husbandry which he\r\npursues. The vast majority of copyhold tenants are peasants, men who\r\nmake a toilsome living from their land with the help of their families\r\nand a few hired servants. But in England by our period the line between\r\nclass and class has ceased to coincide with differences of title; if\r\ncopyhold tenure is born of a humble stock, yet it has risen so much in\r\nthe world that the upper classes are not ashamed to hold out a hand to\r\nwelcome it; and among copyholders are found the names not only of many\r\nsmall freeholders, but also of gentlemen and knights.[119]\r\n\r\n    [119] _Crondal Records_, edited by Baigent, Part I., p. 159; the\r\n    Crondal customary of 1567. Among the copyholders appears a\r\n    knight and four gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAmong the peasants who form the bulk of the population there is, again,\r\nthe greatest diversity. Sometimes the copyholders are simply emancipated\r\nvilleins, who have commuted most of their services, and who hold by copy\r\ninstead of at the will of the lord, but whose economic condition has\r\nhardly changed at all. Thus in Northumberland[120] the holdings of the\r\ncopyholders on several manors reflect very accurately the distribution\r\nof land between the bondage tenants in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies; the holdings have grown slightly in size, but they have\r\napparently a more or less continuous individual existence from the\r\nearliest times. In parts of Wiltshire,[121] on the other hand, though\r\nnot in all parts, there is no possibility of establishing any connection\r\nbetween the virgate and semi-virgate of the fourteenth century villeins\r\nand the acreage held by the copyholders two hundred and fifty years\r\nlater; both in size and number the holdings are markedly different. In\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk ancient class divisions have often been obliterated\r\naltogether, and bond and free lands are interlaced in the holdings of\r\nthe customary tenants in quite inextricable confusion.\r\n\r\n    [120] _Northumberland County History, e.g._ Surveys of High\r\n    Buston (vol. v. p. 208); Acklington (vol. v. p. 372); Birling\r\n    (vol. v. p. 201), and figures of eight townships in\r\n    Tynemouthshire, vol. viii. p. 230.\r\n\r\n    [121] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of the Lands of William, First\r\n    Earl of Pembroke_.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is the greatest variety in the methods of agriculture.[122]\r\nEverywhere among the copyhold tenancies arable land predominates to an\r\nextent which is in marked contrast to the frequent preponderance of\r\npasture land on many of the demesne farms. But to some tillage seems to\r\nbe their sole livelihood, while others are very considerable\r\nsheep-farmers. Some are cultivators on quite a big scale, well outside\r\nthe Board of Agriculture's interpretation of a \"small-holder\" to-day,\r\nwith 80, 90, 100, or even 200 acres of land. Often they are better off\r\neconomically than many freeholders, and when Harrison and Sir Thomas\r\nSmith classify[123] copyholders in general with \"day labourers and poor\r\nhusbandmen,\" they must surely have been either speaking loosely, or else\r\nthinking not of their economic but of their legal position. But others\r\nhold only 5, 10, 15, or 20 acres, so that arithmetical averages of the\r\nsize of their holdings are very little guide to the real distribution of\r\nland. Yet it would not be true to say that such inequality is universal,\r\nfor in the same county one finds some manors on which the holdings seem\r\nall to be cut to a regular standard pattern, and others where the\r\nvariety of size is almost infinite, while in the North striking\r\ndivergences of area seem to be as much the exception as they are the\r\nrule in the South and the East. On some manors, again, the copyhold\r\ntenants have enclosed land and hold much in severalty; on others nearly\r\nall of it lies in the open fields. Some have extensive rights of common,\r\nwhile on other manors such rights are non-existent, or are too\r\ninsignificant to be recorded by surveyors.\r\n\r\n    [122] See below, pp. 105-115.\r\n\r\n    [123] Smith, _De Republica Anglorum_, Lib. I., c. 24. Harrison,\r\n    _Elizabethan England_ (edited by Withington), p. 13.\r\n\r\nIn fact the impression given by the surveys is that of a condition of\r\nthings which is very far from being stationary, but in which, on the\r\ncontrary, much shifting of property and many changes in the methods of\r\ncultivation have been going on, and in which the legal position of the\r\npeasants is no guide at all to their economic characteristics. The task\r\nof finding a manor to serve as a pattern and standard for the rest,\r\nwhich is hard enough in the thirteenth century, is a sheer impossibility\r\nin the sixteenth, and the student works with a deep sense of the danger\r\nof sacrificing fidelity to simplicity of statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) _The Consolidation of Peasant Holdings_\r\n\r\nBut difficult as it is to reduce to any order the very diverse economic\r\nconditions of the customary tenants at the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the task, at any rate in outline, has got to be faced. And this\r\ninvolves a short account of movements which take us some way back into\r\nthe Middle Ages. No one can understand the contrast between the\r\nconditions of the Irish peasantry in 1850 and their condition to-day\r\nwithout knowing something of the agencies which have been at work in the\r\ninterval, of the Fair Rent Courts, the Congested Districts Board, and\r\nthe Land Purchase Acts; no one can appreciate the changes which are\r\ntaking place in rural France without having taken at any rate a glance\r\nat the position of the peasantry before the Revolution, and at the Code\r\nNapoleon. Certainly the substantial alteration which overtook agrarian\r\nrelationships in many parts of England between 1500 and 1640 is\r\nunintelligible if it is regarded as a wave suddenly appearing in a calm\r\nsea, a revolution by means of which commercial relationships of\r\nsometimes an almost modern elasticity developed quite rapidly in village\r\ncommunities of an almost mediæval immobility. To understand the agrarian\r\nproblem of the sixteenth century we must know the sort of framework on\r\nwhich the new forces worked, and the sort of tendencies of which they\r\nwere the continuation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the history with which we are concerned is primarily the\r\nhistory of the peasants as landholders, and only secondarily the history\r\nof their personal condition. Generalisations about the disappearance of\r\nvilleinage and the substitution of hired labour for the working out of\r\nrents in labour services do not help us much here. Speaking broadly, it\r\nis no doubt true that, in spite of the survival of many vestiges of the\r\nold order, wage-labourers are as normally the means of cultivating the\r\ndemesne at the end of the fifteenth century as servile tenants are at\r\nthe end of the thirteenth. But significant as this change is for the\r\nhistory of the wage-earning classes, it does not by itself seem to throw\r\nmuch light on the characteristic features of the sixteenth century\r\nproblem, the substitution of large tenancies for small, the displacement\r\nof small holders, and the undermining of the customary routine of the\r\nopen field village. Certainly the two movements are connected; equally\r\ncertainly that connection is not a direct or obvious one. The change in\r\nthe personal condition of the peasantry is not by itself the key to\r\nchanges in the use and distribution of property. Why should it be? In\r\nPrussia the abolition[124] of villein services in 1807 was carried out\r\nby a decree which had as its object not a diminution, but an increase,\r\nin the number of small tenants; and it is not self-evident that an\r\nalteration in the method of cultivating the lord's demesne must have\r\nproduced changes in the disposition of the customary holdings in\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth century England.\r\n\r\n    [124] Edict of October 9, 1807, Clauses 10, 11, 12. See Cobden\r\n    Club, _Systems of Land Tenure in Various Countries_: Morier's\r\n    Essay on Germany.\r\n\r\nThe very variety in the economic conditions of the peasantry which makes\r\ngeneralisation so difficult is, however, itself a significant feature,\r\nbecause it is in marked contrast with the comparative uniformity which\r\nexisted among great masses of them in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies. It suggests that even in agriculture custom has to some\r\nextent been broken down by commercial enterprise, and that commercial\r\nenterprise has had the natural result of accentuating inequality in the\r\npossession of property. It warns a student of the agrarian changes of\r\nthe sixteenth century that he has not only to explain the way in which\r\nthe small cultivator lost ground then before the large estate, but also\r\nhow it was that his economic position differed in many cases so much\r\nfrom that of the villein of two hundred years before, and that it may\r\nvery well be that the answer to the latter question will throw light\r\nupon the former.\r\n\r\nLet us put ourselves in the position of a jury catechising some \"aged\r\nman\" about the year 1500, catechising him not about boundaries, or\r\nrights of common, or manorial customs, but about the general changes in\r\nthe distribution of property in his village. If surveys and court rolls\r\nmay be trusted, there is one thing that he could hardly fail to tell us,\r\nand that is that for as long as he can remember there has been a great\r\ndeal of buying and selling of land by the customary tenants, a great\r\nmany changes in occupancy, and on the whole a tendency for those changes\r\nto result in the concentration of several holdings in fewer and larger\r\ntenancies. \"Virgates which in grandfather's time,\" he would say, \"used\r\nto belong to A., B., C., and D. now belong to A. alone. Men who used to\r\noccupy one holding each, now occupy two or three; when they cannot buy\r\nthey lease, and some have bought so much that they sublet part of their\r\nholdings to others. Indeed there is not much sense in talking about\r\nvirgates or half-virgates at all. Once each of them had a separate\r\nholder; once Durrant's shottes belonged to Durrant, Gunter's mead to\r\nGunter, Parry's croft to Parry, Hawkins' meade to Hawkins, Woolmer's\r\nlande to Woolmer, Blake's tenement to Blake. To-day, though the old\r\nnames remain, they are no guide to the families holding the land.\r\nFrankling has bought Durrant's and Gunter's and Blake's, Vites has\r\nbought Parry's, while Pynnole's and Pope's and Hawkins' and the rest of\r\nBlake's holdings have all passed into the hands of Blackwell.\"[125]\r\n\r\n    [125] The instance is taken from a map of the manor of Edgeware\r\n    now in the All Souls muniment room. The map was made in 1597.\r\n    But many earlier examples can be found of land being known by\r\n    the name of one of its early holders, long after it had passed\r\n    into the possession of some one else.\r\n\r\nOne thing at any rate is clear. If frequent changes of occupancy point\r\nto a free land-market, then such a free land-market has existed for a\r\nlong time among the customary tenants; and if a keen demand for land\r\namong the peasantry is a proof that small men are thriving, and see\r\ntheir way to thriving still more by adding to their properties, then\r\nthere is a good deal of this healthy land hunger in English villages\r\nbefore the age of the Tudors. We read to-day of how the French peasant\r\nwill pinch himself and his family to add a few acres to his little\r\nestate, and we take it as an indication that small cultivation has a\r\nfirm root in France, and that rural life is on the whole enterprising\r\nand prosperous. Certainly such a state of things is in marked contrast\r\nwith the stagnation prevailing in the lower ranges of village society in\r\ncountries where great estates pass almost intact from generation to\r\ngeneration between the tall palings of family settlements, with the\r\nsmall man, who would get land if he could, staring helplessly through\r\nthe bars. Now, at any rate in the fifteenth century, England belonged\r\nvery markedly to the first type, not to the second; to the type where\r\nthere is much buying and selling of land in small plots by small\r\ncultivators, not to the type where land is locked up and rarely comes\r\ninto the market, rarely at any rate into a market where it can be bought\r\nby the small peasantry. This mobility of land is of much significance\r\nwhen we come to consider the breaking down of customary rules before the\r\nforces of competition, and the formation of great estates out of the\r\nholdings of the customary tenants. Let us consider it in more detail,\r\nfirst from the point of view of the changes in the economic basis of\r\nrural life which it produces, and secondly from the point of view of the\r\nprocess by which those changes were brought about. We will for the\r\npresent leave on one side the demesne farm and the land held on lease,\r\nand look only at the customary land which forms the backbone of the\r\ncopyholders' estates.\r\n\r\nThe first source of information to which we turn consists of the surveys\r\nand rentals, in which the holdings of the tenants are set out in detail.\r\nTo those accustomed to the picture of village life contained in the\r\nrecords of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the surveys of the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries present certain features which at once\r\narrest attention. For one thing, there is a much greater inequality\r\nbetween the holdings of different customary tenants on the same manors\r\nthan is usually found among the holdings of virgators and semi-virgators\r\ntwo centuries before. For another thing, some of their holdings are very\r\nmuch larger than anything we find belonging to the same class of tenants\r\nat an earlier date; occasionally, indeed, they can only be described as\r\nenormous, running into 150 or 200 acres of land; often they amount to 80\r\nor 90. In the third place, the number of customary tenants is, on the\r\nwhole, much smaller than it was 200 years before, and that even on\r\nmanors where there has been an increase in the area cultivated by them.\r\nThe latter fact is significant, and we shall return to it later. But\r\nbefore doing so, let us ask the meaning of the growing inequality in the\r\nholdings of the customary tenants and of the great increase in the size\r\nof some among them.\r\n\r\nGreat as is the variety of conditions visible on a thirteenth century\r\nmanor, it is on the whole true to say that this variety usually conforms\r\nto a rough rule or principle. One can find on the same manor families\r\nwhose holdings differ very largely in size, from the 25 to 40 acres\r\noccupied by the holder of a virgate, the 12 to 16 acres of a\r\nsemi-virgator, to the 2 or 3 acres or less occupied by a cottar. But\r\nnormally each individual holds much the same amount of land as other\r\nindividuals of the same class; one holder of a virgate has about as much\r\nas another holder of a virgate, one holder of half a virgate about as\r\nmuch as his fellow, one cottager about as much as another cottager.\r\nThere are in fact different grades, but for each grade there is what may\r\nbe called a standard area of land, a unit of agrarian organisation, and\r\nthough that standard area varies a good deal in different parts of the\r\ncountry it is usually fairly easy to discover what it is on any one\r\nmanor. Outwardly, at any rate, village life is organised, and the\r\ndistribution of property is settled in the main by the authority of\r\ncustom, rather than by commercial forces acting directly upon the\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\nNow after the middle of the fifteenth century it is common to find quite\r\na different condition of things from this. There are, it is true, manors\r\nwhere holdings preserve their primitive equality down to the very end of\r\nthe sixteenth century, especially manors in backward parts of the\r\ncountry, where the influence of commerce has been little felt;\r\nespecially also manors where the demesne farm, instead of being leased,\r\nhas been retained in the hands of the lord. But in the South of England\r\nthese are the exception. The rule is that with regard to the area held\r\nby the customary tenants there is no rule at all. On the same manor\r\ncopyholders may be cultivating anything from a quarter of a virgate to\r\ntwo, three, four, or even more virgates; if their holdings are expressed\r\nin acres they may be holding anything from 1 acre to 100 or 150.\r\nEconomically, indeed, customary tenants are often not a class at all, if\r\nthe essence of a class is common characteristics and a similarity of\r\neconomic status, though in the face of certain dangers they will act as\r\none. On many manors the nature of their tenure is the only common link\r\nbetween them, and the nature of their tenure is compatible with the\r\ngreatest economic variety.\r\n\r\nThis variety is most noticeable when we examine a large number of manors\r\none by one, since, when the figures of many different manors are added\r\ntogether, their distinctive features are liable to be concealed in the\r\naggregate. Still, to get some idea of the scale on which the peasants\r\ncarried on their agriculture, it is perhaps worth examining the\r\nfollowing table[126] of the holdings of 1600 odd customary[127] tenants\r\non fifty-two manors.\r\n\r\n    [126] For the sources from which this table is constructed, and\r\n    its defects, see Appendix II.\r\n\r\n    [127] On three small manors I have included some tenants who may\r\n    possibly be freeholders or leaseholders.\r\n\r\nThis table enables us, in the first place, to make a comparison between\r\nthe economic positions of groups of tenants in different parts of\r\nEngland. It will be seen that the \"predominant rate\"--what we may call\r\nthe predominant acreage--varies considerably. In Wiltshire it is between\r\n20 and 25 acres, and, including the next two columns, 36 per cent. of\r\nall the tenants hold something between 20 and 35 acres. In\r\nNorthumberland the predominant acreage is between 30 and 35, and nearly\r\none half the tenants, 41 per cent., hold between 30 and 40 acres.\r\nElsewhere the most common holding is a good deal smaller. In Lancashire\r\n(if we omit the cottagers, nearly all of whom come from one manor) the\r\npredominant acreage is between 10 and 15 acres, though a great many\r\npersons hold between 5 to 10 acres. In Staffordshire the largest group\r\nof tenants is that holding under 2-1/2 acres, and more than one-half of\r\nthem hold less than 10 acres. In Norfolk and Suffolk the same state of\r\nthings obtains, but in a more pronounced form. Little emphasis need be\r\nlaid on the large number of cottagers there, nearly all of whom are\r\nfound on a single semi-urban manor, that of Aylsham. But it is clear\r\nthat the mass of the peasantry in those counties are very small holders\r\nindeed. When the cottagers are left on one side, 22 per cent., about\r\none-fifth, of the landholders have under 2-1/2 acres; 54 per cent., more\r\nthan one-half, have under 10 acres. It is fortunate for them that\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk are the home of the woollen industry.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, let us notice a fact which is more relevant to our\r\nimmediate purpose. That fact is the great variety in the scale of\r\nlandholding obtaining between different tenants in the same part of the\r\ncountry. In this matter, again, some counties present a marked contrast\r\nto others. In Northumberland the uniformity in the size of the holdings\r\nof the tenants is much more marked than the variety. About two-thirds\r\nof them appear in the four columns representing holdings from 30 to 50\r\nacres. Only six hold more than 50, and though on one manor there are ten\r\ntenants holding less than 2-1/2 acres, there are, apart from these,\r\ncomparatively few holding under 25 acres. On all the manors which have\r\nbeen examined in this county there is, in fact, a regular standard\r\nholding in the sixteenth century, which varies from 30 to 45 acres on\r\ndifferent manors, but which on the same manor varies hardly at all. But\r\nNorthumbrian agriculture is always several generations behind that of\r\nthe South and East, and when we turn to Wiltshire, or to East Anglia, or\r\nto the nine manors given at the bottom of the table, we find a condition\r\nof things in which there is much greater irregularity. The line extends\r\nfarther at both ends than it does in Northumberland. There are more\r\nindividuals and fewer clusters. The grouping of holdings round certain\r\nstandard patterns is much less marked. If we look at all the manors\r\ntogether, we find that the four most populous columns contain almost\r\nexactly one-half (49.1 per cent.) of the whole population, exclusive of\r\ncottagers without land. In Northumberland the corresponding columns\r\ncontain two-thirds, in East Anglia, Lancashire, and Staffordshire rather\r\nless, on the nine manors in the South and Midlands about one-half, in\r\nWiltshire a little over one-third. Again there are more large holders\r\nand more very small holders in the South and East, than there are in\r\nLancashire and on the Northumbrian border. In Lancashire and\r\nNorthumberland 4.4 per cent. of the tenants, exclusive of cottagers,\r\nhave holdings of more than 50 acres. In Suffolk and Norfolk the\r\ncorresponding figure is 8.5 per cent., in Wiltshire 16.9 per cent., on\r\nthe nine other manors 14 per cent.\r\n\r\nTABLE

the fixed equipment of each group of\r\ntenants with a standard area of land which is one of the first things to\r\nstrike us in a mediæval survey, and, as we shall see later, manorial\r\nauthorities for a long time insist on that rough equality being\r\nmaintained, because any weakening of it would disorganise the\r\nold-fashioned economy which characterises the northern border. In the\r\nindustrial East and South this uniformity existed once, but it exists\r\nnow no longer. Wiltshire is humming with looms; Norfolk and Suffolk are\r\nlinked to the Continent by a thousand commercial ties, and will starve\r\nif the clothiers lose their market. The mighty forces of capital and\r\ncompetitive industry and foreign trade are beginning to heave in their\r\nsleep--forces that will one day fuse and sunder, exalt and put down,\r\nenrich and impoverish, unpeople populous counties and pour Elizabethan\r\nEngland into a smoking caldron between the Irish Sea and the Pennines;\r\nforces that at present are so weak that a Clerk of the Market can lead\r\nthem and a Justice of the Peace put a hook in their jaws. It is natural\r\nthat mediæval conditions of agriculture should survive longest in the\r\nNorth. It is natural that they should survive least where trade and\r\nindustry are most developed, and where men are being linked by other\r\nbonds than those of land tenure. But we must not comment until we have\r\nexamined the text more closely. We would only draw attention to the\r\ncontrast between the South and the North, to the contrast also between\r\nthe great diversity in the size of the peasants' holdings in the\r\nsixteenth century, and the much greater uniformity two or three hundred\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nThis contrast gives a clue to certain features of village life which are\r\ndistinctive of our period, and at the risk of wearying the reader one\r\nmay illustrate it from the circumstances of particular manors. At\r\nCuxham,[128] in 1483, there are, in addition to tiny holdings of a few\r\nacres or of fractions of acres, holdings of one-quarter of a virgate,\r\nof half a virgate, of one virgate, of four virgates. At Ibstone[129] in\r\nthe same year there are two tenants at will holding one virgate each,\r\none tenant holding five tofts and three crofts, while the rest hold\r\nlittle except cottages and gardens. At Warton[130] in Lancashire, there\r\nare in the reign of Henry VIII., in addition to various holdings\r\nexpressed in terms of acres, four holdings of half a bovate, two of\r\nthree-quarters of a bovate, seven of one bovate, two of one and a\r\nquarter bovates, four of one and a half bovates, four of two bovates,\r\none of two and a quarter bovates, one of three bovates. At Barton[131]\r\nin Staffordshire, in 1556, the typical holding is one virgate of 24\r\nacres. But though this forms the nucleus of the copyholders' properties\r\na good many of them have acquired so much extra land, and a good many\r\napparently have parted with so much of the land which they once held,\r\nthat though 24 acres is still the predominant holding, the majority of\r\nthe tenants hold something more or something less than this. At\r\nByshopeston,[132] in 1567, there are men holding half a virgate, two\r\nvirgates, three virgates, four virgates, six virgates. At Knyghton[133]\r\nthere are holders of anything from a half to two and a half virgates.\r\n\r\n    [128] Merton Documents, Rentale de Cuxham (Nos. 5902 and 5905).\r\n\r\n    [129] Merton Documents, Rentale de Ibston (No. 5902).\r\n\r\n    [130] R.O. Rental and Surveys, Gen. Ser., Portf. 19, No. 7, f.\r\n    79-87.\r\n\r\n    [131] R.O. Rentals and Surveys, Gen. Ser., Portf. 14, No. 70.\r\n\r\n    [132] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Lands of William, First Earl\r\n    of Pembroke_.\r\n\r\n    [133] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nLooking at this grouping of holdings, one is tempted at first sight to\r\nsay that the virgate has ceased to be a unit of open field tillage, and\r\nhas become merely a common form, an idea which is laid up in the minds\r\nof surveyors, and which is produced automatically, even when it\r\ncorresponds to nothing in the fluid world of agriculture. This, however,\r\nwould be an error. On the contrary, the conservatism[134] of rural\r\narrangements is such that yardlands, bovates, virgates, and oxgangs,\r\ncontinue to do duty in circumstances which seem quite incongruous, and\r\nto be used, not only in theory, but in practice, to apportion rights\r\nover arable, meadow, and pasture, long after holdings have been\r\nredistributed in such a way as altogether to destroy the former equality\r\nof shares. On the Leicestershire manors of Barkby[135] and Kibworth[136]\r\nholdings were set down in terms of yardlands in 1636, though the\r\ncondition of things in which a yardland or half yardland formed one\r\ntenant's holding had long since given way to one in which the smaller\r\nholders occupied a few acres and the wealthier 2-1/2, 3, and 3-1/2\r\nyardlands. Still, though the continuance of these measures even into the\r\neighteenth century should be noted, there is no reason why we should use\r\nthem, and the modern reader will perhaps get a better idea of the\r\ngrowing heterogeneity in the economic conditions of the customary\r\ntenants if the distribution of their property is expressed in terms of\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n    [134] The inconvenience of reckoning in yardlands is noticed by\r\n    a writer in the seventeenth century: \"The tax of land is after\r\n    the yardland; a name very deceitful by the disproportion and\r\n    inequality thereof, the quantity of some one yardland being as\r\n    much as one and a halfe or two in the same field, and yet there\r\n    is an equality of taxes\" (Joseph Lee, _A Vindication of a\r\n    Regulated Enclosure_, 1656).\r\n\r\n    [135] Merton Documents, MS. book labelled Kibworth and Barkby,\r\n    1636.\r\n\r\n    [136] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nOur first example comes from Malden[137] in Surrey. It shows on a small\r\nscale the tendency towards concentration of property in larger parcels.\r\nIn 1452 there were on that manor one holder of 24 acres, three holders\r\nof 16 acres, two holders of 15 acres, and families holding 10, 8, 6, 5,\r\n2 acres respectively. That 16 acres had been the normal holding is\r\nfairly obvious; it is obvious also that though this normal holding is\r\nstill traceable, it is on the way to being obliterated. Later specimens\r\nof a similar kind come from Ashfield[138] in Suffolk and Ormesby[139] in\r\nNorfolk. In 1513 there were on the former manor tenants holding 7, 10,\r\n15, 21, 22, 36, 37, 45, 107, 121 acres, and all intermediate sizes. On\r\nthe latter, in 1516, the holdings were much smaller, but they were still\r\nmore various in area, ranging from 2 to 31 acres. One or two of the\r\nWiltshire and Somersetshire manors surveyed for the Earl of Pembroke in\r\n1567 offer examples of the reverse state of things in which the tenants'\r\nholdings were all cut out to a standard pattern. At Washerne,[140] for\r\nexample, a manor where the demesnes were not leased but retained \"in\r\nthe hand of the lord,\" nearly all the copyholders had exactly 20 acres\r\neach. But this is an exception which proves the rule. At Estoverton[141]\r\nthere were some tenants holding 69, 48, 38 acres of arable, and others\r\nwith 12, 10, 9, 3, and 2 acres. At Donnington[142] there were holders of\r\n63 and 52 acres in the fields and holders with only 8 or 9 acres. At\r\nSouth Brent[143] the divergence between large and small customary\r\ntenants is more striking still. One occupies about 90 acres, several\r\nothers over 50, while the vast majority hold less than 30 acres in\r\nholdings which are hardly ever of the same size. At Crondal[144] we find\r\nin 1567 exactly the same inequality in the area cultivated by different\r\ntenants, exactly the same combination of very large with very small\r\nholdings. Taking one tithing only of that manor--that of Swanthrop--we\r\nare met by tenants holding 112, 104, 66, 58, 47, 44, 30, 27, 25, and 3\r\nacres. Finally, let us take two extreme instances. They are drawn from\r\nthe closing years of the sixteenth century; but their inclusion may be\r\njustified by the fact that they reveal in a pronounced form the\r\ntendencies which we have seen at work elsewhere a century and a half\r\nbefore, and that they offer a peculiarly clear example of larger\r\ncustomary holdings formed out of the aggregation of several smaller\r\nones, since the names of the previous tenants are stated by the\r\nsurveyor. On the two Middlesex manors of Edgeware[145] and\r\nKingsbury[146] all relics of the state of things which had presumably\r\nexisted there, as on other manors, two or three centuries before, the\r\nstate of things in which there were groups of men holding virgates or\r\nhalf virgates, has disappeared so entirely as to leave no traces behind.\r\nOn the former the thirty-eight copyholders occupy holdings of almost any\r\nsize between 1 rood and 130 acres; out of the 722 acres of copyhold land\r\nas much as 254, a little over one-third, are in the hands of two large\r\ntenants. On the latter there is, _mutatis mutandis_, the same story; out\r\nof the twenty-seven copyholders thirteen hold less than 15 acres, eight\r\nhold more than 30, and of those eight two hold more than 100 acres\r\napiece.\r\n\r\n    [137] Merton Documents, Rental of Malden.\r\n\r\n    [138] R.O.

They suggest that, quite apart[148] from\r\nany movement on the part of lords of manors to throw the holdings of the\r\ncustomary tenants into large farms and to evict their holders, quite\r\napart from any external shock such as was given to the organisation of\r\nvillage life by the change from tillage to pasture on the part of lords\r\nand their farmers, there has been going on an internal change in the\r\nrelation of the customary tenants to each other. So far we have been\r\nconcerned only with the result of that change, not with the process by\r\nwhich it is brought about. The result, as evidenced by the surveys, is\r\nthe consolidation of several holdings, or parts of holdings, into fewer\r\nand larger tenancies, the appearance of a class of well-to-do peasants\r\nby whom such larger tenancies are held, and a widening of the gap\r\nbetween the most prosperous and least prosperous. Customary tenants hold\r\n3 or 4 virgates, 80 or 90 or 100 acres, and their holdings are composed\r\nof holdings and parts of holdings which formerly belonged to several\r\ndifferent tenants. Customary tenants even become the landlords of other\r\ncustomary tenants. At Yateleigh[149] one copyholder has as many as\r\ntwenty sub-tenants, and it is not at all uncommon for the surveyors of\r\nthe sixteenth century to record the names both of owners and occupiers\r\nin estate and field maps. There can hardly be a clearer proof of the\r\nre-arrangement of property which has been going on among them than the\r\nfact that some of them hold more land than they can cultivate themselves\r\nand sub-let it to smaller men, who become their sub-tenants.\r\n\r\n    [147] Similar examples could be adduced from Northamptonshire\r\n    and Leicestershire, were it worth while, _e.g._ at Duston in\r\n    Northants in 1561 there were tenants holding 2 virgates, 1-3/4\r\n    virgates, 1-1/2 virgates, 1/2 virgate, 1/4 virgate (R.O. Rentals\r\n    and Surveys, Portf. 13, No. 23). At Desford in Leicestershire,\r\n    _temp._ Hen. VIII., one finds the same division and aggregation\r\n    of virgates (R.O. Rentals and Surveys, Duchy of Lancs., Bdle. 6,\r\n    No. 7).\r\n\r\n    [148] See below, pp. 72-75.\r\n\r\n    [149] _Crondal Records, loc. cit._\r\n\r\nMay one not say, in fact, that by the beginning of the sixteenth century\r\nthe rough equality which had once existed between the holdings of\r\ndifferent groups of customary tenants is fast disappearing, and that by\r\nthe middle of that century it has, in some parts of the country,\r\ndisappeared altogether? The village community is often no longer made up\r\nof compact groups of holders with more or less equal holdings, more or\r\nless equal rents and services, more or less similar economic positions.\r\nEven as early as the time when the great agrarian changes which\r\ncontemporaries summed up under the name of \"enclosing\" begin to produce\r\nlegislation on the part of governments and riots among the peasantry,\r\nits appearance of a systematic adjustment of property and obligation is\r\nalready far on the way to disappearance. Its members still hold shares\r\nin the open fields, and are still bound by a common routine of\r\ncultivation, save in so far as that routine has been undermined in the\r\nways to be described below. But it is easy to be deceived by the\r\nexternal shell of organisation into thinking of village life at the end\r\nof the fifteenth century as being much more homogeneous than it really\r\nwas. After all there are shareholders and shareholders. There is very\r\nlittle similarity in economic interest or social position between the\r\nartisan who buys a £5 share in a Bolton spinning-mill and a capitalist\r\nwho invests £5000 in the same concern. There was hardly more, one may\r\nsuspect, between the copyholder who cultivated a few acres and the\r\ncopyholder who held 100 or 200 acres and sublet part of his holding to a\r\npoorer neighbour, though the lands of both were intermixed, though both\r\nheld of the same manor, though both were nominally bound by the same\r\ncustom. This comparison says more than we mean; for, with few\r\nexceptions, the inequality in the holdings of the peasantry revealed by\r\nthe manorial documents is not so great that it cannot be spanned by\r\nenterprise and good fortune. Looking back from a world in which the mass\r\nof mankind have no legal interest in the land which they cultivate or\r\nthe tools which they use, what strikes the modern reader most in the\r\nsixteenth century is not the concentration of property, but its wide\r\ndistribution. Nevertheless, even in these petty rearrangements of\r\nholdings there is a meaning. They are the beginning of greater things.\r\nTo appreciate their importance we must obliterate from our minds our\r\nknowledge of later developments, and regard them as the innovation which\r\nthey are. We must remember that they are the economic foundation of a\r\nprosperous rural middle class.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) _The Growth of a Land Market among the Peasants_\r\n\r\nIf the surveys were our sole source of information it would not be easy\r\nto say how this regrouping of holdings has been brought about. Even the\r\nsurveys, however, do not leave us quite in the dark. They suggest that\r\nit has taken place very largely through the play of commercial forces\r\nwithin the ranks of the customary tenants themselves, through the eager\r\npurchasing of land which we noticed as one feature of rural life at the\r\nclose of the Middle Ages, and through the growth of a cash nexus between\r\nindividuals side by side with the rule of custom. This is a factor in\r\nthe break up of the mediæval condition of landholding upon which\r\nsufficient emphasis has perhaps not always been laid. The pre-occupation\r\nof the writers of the sixteenth century with the special problem of\r\ntheir own day, when the existence of a class of well-to-do copyholders\r\nwas taken as something needing no explanation, and their decay before\r\nthe growth of the great leasehold estate occupied the attention of all\r\ninterested in agricultural problems, caused the significance of the\r\ndevelopment of these thriving peasants to be forgotten in the agitation\r\nand regrets which accompanied their depression, and naturally\r\nconcentrated interest on the changes introduced by lords and great\r\nfarmers, through which that depression was mainly caused. In every age\r\nprosperity is taken as a matter of course, and, in defiance of all\r\nexperience, mankind reserves its surprise for distress.\r\n\r\nBut the special phenomenon of the growth of large customary tenancies\r\nwhich we have been considering can hardly be explained except as a\r\nresult of enterprise among the tenants themselves. The piling up of\r\ncustomary holdings in the hands of one individual is quite a different\r\nthing from the adding of customary holdings to the demesne which the\r\nlord retained or leased to a farmer. It means a transference of\r\nproperty, but a transference not from a customary tenant to the lord or\r\nthe lord's farmer, but from one customary tenant to another. It suggests\r\nthat before the \"enclosing movement\" of the sixteenth century brought\r\nits crop of evictions, economic forces had long been at work to break up\r\nthe village community into large holders and small. When in 1452 John\r\nBlackman, copyhold tenant of Maiden,[150] holds Keyser's, Key's, and\r\nSkinner's tenements, it can only mean that Keyser, Key, and Skinner have\r\nparted with their tenements to John Blackman. The lord may have put\r\npressure upon them to sell, but the customary land is not diminished, it\r\nis simply rearranged; the result is not an addition to the manorial\r\ndemesne, but the appearance of a copyhold tenant with a great deal more\r\nland than his neighbours. The cases in which the existence of more than\r\none survey of the same manor enables us to contrast the condition of the\r\ncustomary tenants at different dates make it quite clear that this\r\naggregation of holdings was a well-marked movement which went on quite\r\napart from any encroachment by manorial authorities on the customary\r\nland. Some time between 1340 and 1454 two virgates at Castle Combe,[151]\r\nwhich at the earlier date were in separate hands, have been formed into\r\none holding. And naturally, the later we come, the more marked the\r\nchange which we find. At Aspley Guise[152] in 1275 the forty customary\r\ntenants each held almost exactly half a virgate. In 1542 one finds among\r\nthe tenants at will and copyholders three occupants of the original half\r\nvirgate, one tenant with 30 acres, two tenants with 60 acres each, three\r\ntenants with 75 acres each. These large holdings have plainly been\r\nformed by the aggregation of half virgates in fewer hands and into\r\nparcels of two, three, four, and five half virgates apiece. This case is\r\na very clear one, because nearly all the holdings are multiples of the\r\noriginal standard, even the rent being calculated from this basis.\r\n\r\n    [150] Merton Documents, Rental of Maiden, 1496.\r\n\r\n    [151] _History of Castle Combe_ (Scrope).\r\n\r\n    [152] For information as to Aspley Guise I am indebted to the\r\n    kindness of Dr. H.G. Fowler of Aspley Guise, who has allowed me\r\n    to see the material which he has collected for a history of the\r\n    manor.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the aggregation of small customary holdings into large is\r\nequally marked, but it has not been carried out with such a nice regard\r\nto the maintenance of the original units. In the tithing of South[153]\r\nNewton, part of the Manor of South Newton in Wiltshire, there were in\r\n1315 seven holders of a virgate, each of whom occupied 23 acres,\r\nseventeen holders of half a virgate with 12 acres each, and eight\r\ncottagers. When the manor was surveyed in 1567 the customary tenants,\r\nthough fewer in number, cultivated a good deal more land than they had\r\ntwo and a half centuries before, so that there is no question of their\r\nholdings having been merged in the demesne. But the land was very\r\ndifferently distributed between them. Of the ten copyholders then\r\nremaining only one held the original virgate. Of the rest there were\r\nholders of 59, 65, 80, and 96 acres, of 7, 13, and 15 acres, and of\r\nvarious acreages between these wide limits. The symmetry of the earlier\r\narrangement has entirely vanished. Instead of a cluster of small\r\ncultivators organised in three well-defined layers, we have a chain\r\nstretching from a mere cottager up to a petty capitalist. A very similar\r\nchange has taken place on the Manor of Crondal.[154] If one compares,\r\nfor example, the arrangement of holdings on the tithing of Swanthrop in\r\n1287 and 1567, one finds that the rough symmetry which existed at the\r\nformer date has altogether disappeared by the latter. In 1287 there were\r\neight persons holding virgates, seven holding half virgates, two holding\r\nquarter-virgates, and four whose holdings are not expressed in virgates.\r\nBy 1567 all this has been altered. There are tenants holding 100, 66,\r\n58, 47 acres; there are three with less than 10 acres, and there are\r\nfive with holdings of various sizes between these limits, but in no case\r\nreducible to any common measure. How could such a transformation come\r\nabout, unless, as was suggested above, there was much buying and selling\r\nof land, much rudimentary commercialism inside and behind the decent\r\ncloak of routine which seems to be spread over our villages? Is not this\r\nexplanation forced upon us when we examine the holdings of the larger\r\npeasants and find them made up of pieces bought from one and leased\r\nfrom another, pieces taken from the waste or from the lord's demesne or\r\nfrom the common pasture? And if it is correct, does it not point, on the\r\none hand, to a good deal of enterprise among the small holders, and\r\nsince enterprise can hardly exist without a certain level of prosperity,\r\nto a good deal of prosperity; and, on the other hand, to movements which\r\nin time are likely to dethrone custom altogether and put competition in\r\nits place?\r\n\r\n    [153] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Lands of William, First Earl\r\n    of Pembroke_ (Straton).\r\n\r\n    [154] _Crondal Records_ (Baigent), pp. 111-116, and 210-222.\r\n\r\nTo these questions we shall return later. But happily we are not\r\nrestricted to inferential argument for our knowledge of these internal\r\nchanges in the economy of village life before the sixteenth century. We\r\nhave the court rolls of manors, and the court rolls are full, from a\r\nvery early date, of transactions which show how the state of things\r\nwhich has been described was being brought about. In examining the\r\nevidence which they offer of the shifting of property among the\r\npeasantry we shall have to go some way back, and we shall do well to\r\nbegin with a distinction and a warning--a distinction between the legal\r\nframework of rural life and its economic tendencies, and a warning that\r\nwe shall have to deal with a somewhat tiresome mass of detail, which the\r\ngeneral reader can avoid by turning to the summary at the end of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nIn the picture of the mediæval manor which is usually offered us the\r\nfeatures which receive most emphasis are its systematic apportionment of\r\nworks and services, its regulation by binding customary rules, its\r\nimmobility and imperviousness to competitive and commercial influences;\r\nin short, its character as an organisation in which even the details are\r\nsettled by custom. In the \"typical manor,\" as it appears in some\r\naccounts, the main lines are drawn with almost photographic sharpness.\r\nThere are the free holders on the free land, the bond tenants each with\r\nhis virgate or half virgate of bond land, and the officers and servants\r\nof the lord, a system the parts of which are knit together by the lord's\r\nneed of extracting labour services to cultivate his demesne. Now that\r\nthe internal economy of a thirteenth century manor displays to a very\r\nremarkable degree the authority of custom in all its arrangements is\r\nnot, of course, denied; and it is specially proper to emphasise it when\r\nwe are contrasting it with modern agriculture, or when we are regarding\r\nit from the standpoint of law. But this is only one aspect of it, and if\r\nwe assume that the economic relationships between the different members\r\nof it always followed the same grouping and ran on the same lines as the\r\nlegal ones, we are likely to ascribe to them a simplicity and a hard and\r\nfast character which, we may be quite sure, they never possessed in real\r\nlife, and to miss those very innovations which throw most light on\r\neconomic development.\r\n\r\nTrue of such development early rentals and surveys show little trace.\r\nBut let us remember the purpose for which they were prepared. The\r\nmanorial officials were concerned with getting in an income, not with\r\nsupplying information about the methods of agriculture or the\r\ncross-relations between one tenant and another, except in so far as they\r\naffected the manorial revenue. The source of the income was the holding,\r\nnot the holder; or, rather, it did not matter to them who the landholder\r\nwas, whether he was one individual or another, or whether he was a\r\npartnership of half-a-dozen individuals, provided that the land, however\r\nheld, yielded the customary services and payments. The nearest analogy\r\nwould be an apportioned tax which a Government divides between different\r\nlocalities, each locality having to raise a certain sum, but making its\r\nown arrangements as to what individuals shall pay. It is the virgate\r\nwhich pays rents, which mows the lord's meadow, reaps the lord's fields,\r\ncarries the lord's messages, pays a stoup of honey and a churchshot of\r\nwhite corn; and as long as the meadow is mowed and the message carried,\r\nthe question what individual holds the virgate is quite a subsidiary one\r\nfor the bailiff, and one which the tenants can arrange among themselves\r\nmuch as they please. Each half virgate at Cuxham[155] has got to do two\r\nboonworks or pay 4d. But the manorial economy is not at all disturbed by\r\nthe fact of one tenant holding not half a virgate, but a virgate and a\r\nhalf; for he has to do, or pay some one else to do, six boonworks and\r\npay 2s. if he does not. A half-hide at Bramshot[156] has to make\r\nhalf-a-dozen different payments in money and kind; but there is another\r\nto prevent John, Stephen, Roger, and William clubbing together to work\r\nit and arranging the payments among themselves as they please.\r\n\r\n    [155] Merton Documents, No. 5902, Rental of Cuxham, 1483:\r\n    \"Johannes ... pro uno messuagio et una virgata terræ et dimidia\r\n    xxiiis. et 6 precaria in autumno vel 2s....

The shares stand in A.'s name, but the interest may go\r\nto A.'s married daughter. The holding stands in the name of Thomas in\r\nthe books of the manor, but it may be that part or all of it is worked\r\nby Walter. To put the case in another way, to the lord and his steward a\r\nmanor is primarily a business, a business on which various obligations\r\ncan be imposed and from which various profits can be extracted. But it\r\nis also a village community consisting of peasants whose economic\r\nrelations are by no means exhausted in the interest which the lord takes\r\nin them as part of its stock, and who have economic dealings which are\r\nimportant when we begin to inquire into changes in the distribution of\r\npeasant property. The number of the holdings and the amount of payments\r\nand services may remain quite unaltered, and yet at the same time if one\r\nindividual begins to acquire several shares his property will grow at\r\nthe expense of other persons. Precisely because it is new, the\r\nappearance of such small capitalists is not readily traceable in the\r\nstereotyped forms used by the manorial officials. Precisely because it\r\nis new, it is of the greatest economic significance. It shows what may\r\nbe called, by contrast with later developments, the old agrarian régime,\r\nproducing the new type of well-to-do peasant who is one of the\r\nprotagonists in the class struggles of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n    [157] Vinogradoff, _Villainage in England_, pp. 250-251: \"The\r\n    general arrangement admitted a certain subdivision under the\r\n    cover of an artificial unity, which found its expression in the\r\n    settlement of the services and of the relations with the lord.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this upward movement is no mere matter of conjecture. That behind\r\nthe stiff legal framework of the manorial organisation there was a\r\ntendency for property to pass into the hands of the more prosperous\r\ntenants, and that there was a sort of primitive commercialism even at a\r\ntime when commercial ideas had little influence over the methods of\r\nagriculture, becomes evident if we examine the elements out of which the\r\nsmall properties of the fourteenth century are composed. The gradual\r\nformation of a class of wealthy peasants took place in three ways,\r\nthrough the buying up by well-to-do men of parts of their neighbours'\r\nproperties, through the colonising by villages of the unoccupied land\r\nsurrounding them, and through the addition to the customary holdings of\r\nplots which had at one time been in the occupation of the lord, but\r\nwhich, for one reason or another, he found it more profitable to sell or\r\nlease to his tenants. Even before the end of the thirteenth century it\r\nis by no means unusual to find land changing holders pretty rapidly both\r\nby transfer and by lease. The customary land passes in the manorial\r\ncourt; the outgoing tenant surrenders it, and the incoming tenant is\r\nformally admitted by the steward. When a peasant leaves the manor or\r\ndies without heirs, the other tenants offer a sort of small land-market,\r\nand bid for his land or part of it to add to their own. Hence holdings\r\nor fractions of holdings change hands with some frequency at the court\r\ncustomary, the well-to-do, who can afford to take more land, offering\r\nthe lord an increased rent to obtain a share in a holding the possession\r\nof which has for some reason lapsed. In the court rolls of the\r\nLincolnshire manor of Ingoldmells,[158] for example, there are many such\r\ntransfers, six sales occurring in successive courts held in 1315 and\r\n1316. At Crondal,[159] in 1282, a tenant has for some reason given up\r\nhis holding; the rest of the community dart on it like minnows on a\r\npiece of bread; and it is at once split up among as many as ten other\r\ntenants, who find sureties for the continuance of the normal services.\r\nAt Hadleigh,[160] in 1305, a tenant sells part of his land to be built\r\nupon. At Castle[161] Combe, in 1367, a villein enters by licence of the\r\nlord on two virgates of land and a separate pasture.\r\n\r\n    [158] _Ingoldmells Court Rolls_ (Massingberd), October 1315 to\r\n    June 1316.\r\n\r\n    [159] _Crondal Records_ (Baigent), pp. 152-153.

Professor Unwin has some suggestive remarks on\r\n    similar developments in other parts of the county.\r\n\r\n    [161] _History of Castle Combe_ (Scrope), p. 162: \"Johannes\r\n    Pleyslede, nativus domini, cepit de domino unum messuagium et\r\n    duas virgatas terrae tenendas in bondagio, secundum\r\n    consuetudinem manerii ... Reddit etiam annuatim sex denarios pro\r\n    quadam pastura vocata le Hatche, et pro via ad eandem.\"\r\n\r\nSuch examples of what may be called petty land speculation could be\r\nmultiplied almost indefinitely, and point to a good deal of mobility in\r\nrural society even in the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. At\r\nthe same time one can see signs of relationships of a more complicated\r\ncharacter tending to establish themselves between the tenants, and\r\nbreaking up the symmetry of the manorial arrangements. There is a marked\r\ntendency for holdings not to remain intact but to be split up among\r\ndifferent holders. Sometimes this takes place in the ordinary course of\r\ntransference from father to son. The virgate held by the former is\r\ndivided, for example, into two cotlands, each of which is held by one\r\nchild,[162] or the heir to a holding divides it with his mother.[163]\r\nMore frequently one is left to infer the actual process of division\r\nfrom the way in which the Rentals describe holdings as being occupied by\r\ngroups or partnerships[164] of tenants, who share the land between them,\r\neach being responsible for a part of the rents and services owing from\r\nthe virgate. Such an arrangement does not imply that there is any\r\npartnership in actual cultivation, any partnership in the modern sense\r\nof the word. It means, on the contrary, that the different parts of the\r\nholding are divided among several different cultivators, and that its\r\napparent unity is quite artificial, simply a fiscal expression to enable\r\nthe authorities to see that it renders its share of payments and\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n    [162] _Crondal Records_ (Baigent), p. 129, Rental of Dupehale\r\n    (Dippenhall) 1287: \"Edmunde de Bosco and William de Bosco hold 2\r\n    cotlands which were formed out of one virgate of land which Adam\r\n    de Bosco formerly held.\"\r\n\r\n    [163] _Ibid._, p. 153: \"Margery Palmer comes and surrenders into\r\n    the hands of the lord a virgate of land with a house in Crondal,\r\n    and Galfrid her son comes and gives to the lord 6s. 8d. to have\r\n    seizin thereof, upon this condition, that the said Margery have\r\n    the third part, and two pieces more, of the aforesaid tenement,\r\n    for the term of her life.\"\r\n\r\n    [164] _Crondal Records_ (Baigent), p. 117, Rental of Yateleigh,\r\n    1287: \"John de la Perke and Thomas Squel hold one virgate of\r\n    land containing 22 acres, on payment therefor of 2s. 10d. on the\r\n    Feast of St. Michael and 7-1/2 for Pondpany, and one stoup of\r\n    honey, and 75 eggs, and shall perform all services like Thomas\r\n    Kach.... Walter le White and Osbert de la Knelle hold one\r\n    virgate of land containing 29-1/2 acres.... Roys de Pothulle and\r\n    John le White hold one virgate of land containing 29 acres.\"\r\n\r\nAgain there is much leasing and sub-letting of land by the more\r\nprosperous of the customary tenants. Like labourers who hold allotments\r\nto-day, they often find it convenient to hire extra land and at the same\r\ntime to let out parts of their own holdings, which may be inconveniently\r\nsituated, or hard to work, or for some other reason not worth retaining.\r\nThus in Lancashire the Clitheroe[165] court rolls show many fines being\r\npaid in the early fourteenth century for permission to \"tavern,\" that is\r\nsimply to lease, land. In 1351 there are several tenants on the manor of\r\nSutton[166] in Hampshire who have leased cotlands from the larger\r\ncustomary tenants. At Crokeham on the neighbouring manor of Crondal[167]\r\nwe hear as early as 1287 of one tenant paying 12d. for his holding\r\n\"through the rents of\" another customary tenant, who stands as an\r\nintermediate landlord between him and the manorial authorities. On this\r\nmanor, indeed, sub-letting of land proceeded very far, and had created\r\nby the middle of the sixteenth century exactly the result which one\r\nwould have expected, the existence, namely, of a considerable number of\r\nsubtenants holding land from the copyholders and known by the name of\r\nHallmote[168] tenants. Nor is mere subtenancy the most elaborate of the\r\narrangements which arise among these Lilliputian capitalists. The\r\npeasants deal in land, and naturally they employ land agents to act as\r\nbrokers for their bargains. When \"Robert Bagges surrenders one bovate of\r\nvillein land into the hands of the lord for the use of Symon Clerk, and\r\nthe same Symon forthwith surrenders the aforesaid bovate to the lord for\r\nthe use of William Flaxman, and William Flaxman pays 12d. to enter\r\nthereupon,\"[169] may we not say that we have the whole machinery of land\r\nspeculation, seller, middleman, and client, complete?\r\n\r\n    [165] _Court Rolls of the Lordships, Wapentakes, and Demesne\r\n    Manors of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster_ (edited by W.

But it is not easy to describe the sort of\r\nconditions in which this petty commercialism, this emergence of peasants\r\nricher and more prosperous than their fellows, takes place. Clearly it\r\nimplies the existence of small stores of capital, of some surplus over\r\nthe consumption of the current year, which its fortunate possessors can\r\nuse as a starting-point for further acquisitions; nor ought this to\r\nsurprise us, for the usurer who traffics in his neighbours' misfortunes\r\nby lending money or corn at exorbitant rates, is by no means an\r\nunfamiliar bugbear in the mediæval village. Clearly, again, we must not\r\nlook for some single _primum mobile_ to explain how such small capitals\r\ncould be brought into existence. With all its apparent homogeneity the\r\nmanorial population had, from the beginning of things, included people\r\nsome of whom were in so much better a position than others for building\r\nup considerable properties as to make it no matter for astonishment\r\nthat, as time went on, they should improve their advantage and attract\r\nmore than their share of any increase in wealth which might take place.\r\nThe appearance in the fourteenth century of a rural middle class is,\r\nindeed, much less remarkable than the extreme slowness of its\r\ndevelopment in the more backward parts of the country. For one thing,\r\neven the strictest equalisation of shares could not prevent the holder\r\nof exceptionally fertile land from being better off than his less\r\nfortunate fellow. Since services and rents were based on the\r\nrequirements of the demesne, with a view to their rough apportionment\r\namong all the peasants, and were not adjusted, like modern competitive\r\nrents, so as to sweep away the surplus arising on superior sites, the\r\noccupants of the latter could build up, under the ægis of custom, the\r\nnucleus of a very considerable property.[170] For another thing, the\r\nmere fact that the village was subordinated to a lord, who exploited it\r\nby means of officers and servants, supplied village society with an\r\nupper layer of people who had larger opportunities than the mass of the\r\npeasantry for improving their position. Stewards, bailiffs, and greaves\r\nwere frequently rewarded for their services with grants of land for\r\nwhich only a nominal rent was asked, and of course the most obvious way\r\nof using their advantage was further to increase it by adding to their\r\nproperties. In a somewhat similar position to these were the peasants\r\nwho were let off easily because their labour was not needed for the\r\nlord's estate. It is quite a mistake to think of the mediæval villager\r\nas a man pinned down to subsistence level by the economic pressure which\r\ngrinds, as in a mortar, the poorest classes in modern society. Of course\r\nindividuals were cruelly oppressed, and when the harvest failed whole\r\ncommunities, as in India to-day, must sometimes have been blotted out at\r\na blow. But the whole story of the extraordinary upward movement which\r\ntook place among the peasantry in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies is unintelligible, unless we admit that the legal\r\nrightlessness of the villein was, in fact, quite compatible with a good\r\ndeal of economic prosperity. His liability to the manorial authorities,\r\nthough in law unqualified, was in reality a liability limited, on the\r\none hand, by the rule of custom, and, on the other, by the fact that he\r\nworked, not for an ever hungry world-market, but for a by no means\r\ninsatiable local demand. Since services were adjusted to holdings, not\r\nto holders, a family of five or six persons usually did not send more\r\nthan one or two to work on the lord's estate, and the remainder had\r\nopportunities for economic advancement, which necessarily became greater\r\nas the growth of population made the weight of the lord's requirements\r\nless exacting.[171] Moreover, the rudimentary specialisation of\r\nindustrial employments, which can plainly be seen going on in the\r\nvillages of the fourteenth century, brought into existence the man who\r\nwas half peasant, half artisan or tradesman, and who could employ the\r\nmoney which he made in trade to carry on his husbandry on a larger scale\r\nthan his neighbours. Such, for example, were the smiths, carpenters,\r\nturners, shoemakers, tailors, butchers, walkers, websters, and shearmen,\r\nwho appear so constantly in Poll Tax returns.[172] When a weaver is\r\nable, though a villein, to leave 3000 marks to his heirs,[173] the\r\nvillage capitalist has plainly come upon the scenes. Nor must we forget\r\nthat, however self-contained some manors may have been, there were\r\nothers whose proximity to a chartered town or to a seaport acted as a\r\nmagnet to draw rural conditions out of the rut of custom. Among the\r\nserfs who bought permission to emigrate, there were some who, having\r\nmade money as town craftsmen, strayed back to their \"villein nest,\" and\r\nacquired considerable properties with their hardly amassed wealth, like\r\nthe Italian or Austrian peasant of to-day, who, after years spent in the\r\nsunless tenements and restaurants of New York, returns at last to be the\r\nenvy of Calabrian and Tyrolese villages. From several sides at once,\r\ntherefore, from those who socially rank above the mass of the\r\npopulation, from the peasant who combines trade and husbandry, from the\r\nenterprising serf who sets out to make his fortune at a distance, forces\r\nare at work to build up the considerable holdings that are the basis of\r\nthe well-to-do peasantry of the future.\r\n\r\n    [170] See below, pp. 115-121.\r\n\r\n    [171] See _E.H.R._, vol. xv. pp. 774-813; Vinogradoff's review\r\n    of Page's _The End of Villeinage in England_.\r\n\r\n    [172] Powell, _The Revolt in East Anglia_, Appendix I.; and\r\n    Putnam, _The Enforcement of the Statute of Labourers_, pp.\r\n    80-81.\r\n\r\n    [173] Scrope, _History of the Manor and Barony of Castle Combe_.\r\n    p. 233.\r\n\r\nBut while these causes were always operating on individuals, the most\r\npotent influence in forming a class of prosperous peasants was, no\r\ndoubt, the spread of commerce and its reaction on agriculture. Its\r\neffect is shown by the fact that it is just in those parts of the\r\ncountry where trade is most highly developed, and where, therefore, the\r\nuse of money and the growth of wealth encourage speculation of all\r\nkinds, that the commercialising of landed relationships, and the\r\nappearance of a middle class, arises earliest and spreads furthest. The\r\nchange is specially noticeable in the Eastern counties, which, from an\r\nearly date, are the home of industry. Examples of the extreme variety\r\nand irregularity in the holdings of the customary tenants on the manors\r\nof Suffolk in the sixteenth century, which we have already contrasted\r\nwith the arrangements in the backward parts of the country such as\r\nNorthumberland, begin to make their appearance at a very early date in\r\nthat county of fisheries and manufactures. At Hadleigh,[174] where the\r\nwoollen industry has set money in circulation, the processes both of\r\nsplitting up the customary holdings, and of letting two or three of them\r\nto a single tenant, is conspicuous at the beginning of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and has completely altered the distribution of property which\r\nexisted a century before. At the little fishing village of\r\nGorleston[175] at the end of the thirteenth century each of the former\r\ntenancies was divided up among several tenants, sometimes three or four,\r\nsometimes eight or ten, and once as many as twenty. At Hawstead, in the\r\nsame county, the free tenants have let off part of their holdings and\r\nadded to them by leasing additional land in its place. In short,\r\nwhenever trade becomes a serious factor in rural life, one finds a very\r\ngeneral tendency for new arrangements of land to grow up side by side\r\nwith the customary holdings, which are the backbone of the manor,\r\nbecause it is from them that the lord extracts his services for the\r\ncultivation of the desmesne. As long as the necessity for labour\r\nservices continues, the number of holdings does not undergo any\r\nappreciable alteration, but the number of holdings ceases to be a guide\r\nto the number of holders.\r\n\r\n    [174] _Victoria County History of Suffolk_, Unwin's article on\r\n    Social and Economic History.\r\n\r\n    [175] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the organisation of the manor is compatible with a good\r\ndeal of shifting of property among the customary tenants, and that an\r\nalteration in its arrangements begins at a comparatively early date,\r\nwithout any external shock and through the desire of such tenants as can\r\nafford it to buy and lease land from other tenants who are less well\r\noff. If such a tendency were at all general, it would explain the\r\ngradual aggregation of larger holdings into fewer hands, and the\r\nappearance of considerable inequality in economic status among members\r\nof the village community whose legal position was the same. Sometimes,\r\nindeed, the authorities of the manor think that the process is going on\r\ntoo fast, that tenants have forgotten that, though they deal in land as\r\nthough it were their own, it is really the lord's, and that they must\r\nnot jeopardise the rents and services which he expects from it by\r\nalienating it without his permission. Sometimes a day of reckoning\r\ncomes, when \"tenants having more than one customary tenement\" are \"to\r\nshow cause why they should not be excluded from the other tenements but\r\none, unless license be granted them.\"[176] But in view of the multitude\r\nof transactions which come before us, we can hardly doubt that licence\r\nwas nearly always granted if the purchaser or lessee was thought by the\r\nsteward to be substantial enough to make the land do its duty,[177] and\r\nthat tenants who wanted to buy and sell, lease and let, had very little\r\nopposition to expect from the lord or his steward.\r\n\r\n    [176] _Merton Documents_, \"A table of the Matters, Orders, and\r\n    Customs Conteyned in Severall Courts of the Manor, 1563\": \"Daye\r\n    given to all ye tenants of ye manor to remove and expell their\r\n    undertenants by Michaelmas that shall be in ye yeare 1563, upon\r\n    paine of every delinquent forfeiting 20s.\" \"Daye given to the\r\n    aforesaid tenants having above one customary tenement to be here\r\n    at ye next court to shew,\" etc., as above. See the Customary of\r\n    High Furness quoted below, p. 101; also Hone, _The Manor and\r\n    Manorial Records_, pp. 177-178, Court Rolls of Payton, Oxon.:\r\n    \"And the aforesaid Laurence Pemerton, in his life time,\r\n    substituted Walter Milleward as his subtenant ... contrary to\r\n    the custom of the Manor without license; therefore let him have\r\n    a talk thereon with the King's officer before the next court.\"\r\n\r\n    [177] This is the meaning of entries of two names as \"sureties\"\r\n    when land changes hands. See _Crondal Records_, Court Rolls of\r\n    1281 and 1282, _passim_.\r\n\r\nAfter all the picture is one which we ought not to have any difficulty\r\nin understanding, if once we get rid of the idea, born of our melancholy\r\nmodern experience, that the buying of land in small parcels is for the\r\nsmall man the road to ruin, a luxury in which none but the well-to-do\r\ncan afford to indulge. We have all heard much of the iniquities of the\r\nEnglish system of land transfer, and have contrasted its cumbersomeness,\r\nits expense, its uncertainty, with the facilities for buying small plots\r\noffered by methods like those of France, where sales and mortgages are\r\nentered in a public registry, which any one has the right to inspect.\r\nBut we need not look to the Continent or the British Dominions to see a\r\nmarket for real property working freely and smoothly. In our period by\r\nfar the most general form of tenure was one customary tenure or another,\r\nand whatever the disadvantages of customary tenure may have been--and\r\nthey were many--they had one great compensating advantage. Customary\r\nholdings could be transferred easily, cheaply, and with certainty, by\r\nsurrender and admission in the court of the manor. Since there was no\r\ndoubt that the freehold was in the lord, there was no expensive\r\ninvestigation of titles to eat up the prospective profits of the\r\npurchaser, and the Court Rolls offered a record, one is tempted to say a\r\nregister, of the nature of the interest which a tenant had had in any\r\nholding from time immemorial. Of course the adjustment of the respective\r\nclaims of lords and tenants raised very knotty problems, and these will\r\nbe examined later. But, as long as they were in abeyance, the fact that\r\npeasant holdings could be transferred so readily contributed to the\r\nbreaking up in the regularity of manorial arrangements, to the passage\r\nof land from one family to another, and to the formation of larger\r\nproperties out of small.[178]\r\n\r\n    [178] Since writing the above I have seen that the same view of\r\n    the advantages of copyhold (the descendant of villein) tenure is\r\n    taken by Dr. Hasbach, who quotes an eighteenth century writer to\r\n    the effect that copyhold as compared with freehold land had the\r\n    advantage of \"the greater certainty of its title and the\r\n    cheapness of its conveyance\" (Hasbach, _A History of the English\r\n    Agricultural Labourer_, pp. 72-73).\r\n\r\nSuch petty transactions among the peasantry were not, however, the only\r\nway in which substantial peasant properties came into existence. In\r\naddition to the transference of land from one tenant to another there\r\nwere other causes working to produce much the same results. The first\r\nwas the continuous taking in of plots of waste land by tenants who got\r\npermission from the manorial authorities to make encroachments upon it.\r\nThe second was the abandonment of the system of cultivating the demesne\r\nby the labour rents of the tenants. Long before the enclosing of the\r\ncommon waste by lords of manors and farmers had become a very serious\r\ngrievance--that it was a grievance at an early date is proved by the\r\nStatute of Merton[179]--one finds arrangements being made for bringing\r\nunused land under cultivation. Sometimes this movement goes on on a very\r\nlarge scale indeed; the Abbey of St. Albans gets a licence from the King\r\nin 1347 to \"improve its wastes aforesaid and to grant and let them for\r\ntheir true value to whomsoever of their tenants comes to take\r\nthem;\"[180] and about the same time 500 acres of waste in the forest of\r\nHigh Peak[181] are let by the Crown to three tenants, much to the\r\ndisgust of the neighbouring commoners. Usually the encroachments on the\r\nwaste take place piecemeal. The process by which piece after piece was\r\nclipped off it and added to the tenants' holdings is shown very clearly\r\nin Rentals and Court Rolls. Occasionally it goes on without sanction; a\r\ntenant surreptitiously draws into his holding an extra piece of land for\r\nwhich he pays nothing, and is only found out when he has occupied it for\r\nsome time. But this is rare, for such encroachments are a source of\r\nprofit to the lord, both in the payment made for the original permission\r\nto make them and in the rent coming from them, and the steward is\r\ntherefore careful that they should be made through the court and entered\r\nin detail on the rolls of the manor. Thus at Ashton-under-Lyne,[182] in\r\n1422, both freeholders and customary tenants had made large intakes of\r\nwood and waste and were paying for some of them as much as 13s. 4d. and\r\n10s. The Halmote Court of Colne[183] in 1324 shows many tenants paying a\r\nfew pence for acres and half acres of waste. At Yateleigh,[184] in 1287,\r\nalmost every one of the fifty-three customary tenants held, in addition\r\nto his land in the open fields, land taken from the waste amounting in\r\nthe aggregate to 37 acres, while some possessed no land at all except\r\nthat which they had thus reclaimed. In the tithing of Aldershot,[185] on\r\nthe same manor, one tenant held 52 acres in encroachments. At\r\nCrokeham[186] another held 63-1/2 acres in addition to the standard half\r\nvirgate of customary land; another, at Southwood,[187] 16 acres.\r\n\r\n    [179] 1235, c. 4. One may remark, however, that the power which\r\n    a single freeholder had had before 1235 to prevent the breaking\r\n    up or enclosure of common pastures, even when he had more than\r\n    was sufficient for his own beasts, was a genuine hardship for\r\n    the lord, for other freeholders, and for the customary tenants;\r\n    see the remarks in Pollock and Maitland (_History of English\r\n    Law_, vol. i. p. 612).\r\n\r\n    [180] _Gesta Abbatum Monasterii St. Albani_, vol. iii. pp.\r\n    120?-121, quoted by Petruschevsky, _op. cit._, pp. 179?-180.\r\n\r\n    [181] _Victoria County History_, Derbyshire, vol. ii. p. 170.\r\n\r\n    [182] Glover, _History of Ashton_, p. 355. \"Richard the Hunte\r\n    ... for an intake 3d. ...

In\r\n    the north of England there seems to have been very much\r\n    colonising of the waste, perhaps because original settlements\r\n    were small. See Turner, _History of Brighouse, Rastrick, and\r\n    Hipperholme_, pp. 66?-67, and _Trans. Rochdale Literary and\r\n    Philosophical Society_, vol. vii., Rochdale Manor Inquisition.\r\n\r\n    [184] _Crondal Records_ (Baigent), pp. 116?-120, _e.g._ \"Robert,\r\n    son of Peter de la Pierke, holds one acre of encroachment land\r\n    on paying 4d.\"\r\n\r\n    [185] _Ibid._, pp. 123-?127.\r\n\r\n    [186] _Ibid._, pp. 131?-134. \"Richard Wysdon holds half a\r\n    virgate of land containing 16 acres.... The same holds 63-1/2\r\n    acres, which were in his ancient occupation, and were found to\r\n    be over and above his said virgate, and (included) in many\r\n    encroachments.\"\r\n\r\n    [187] _Ibid._, pp. 122-?123: \"William of Southwoode holds 16\r\n    acres of encroachments and other detached pieces.\"\r\n\r\nThe process of nibbling away the waste was, in fact, very general, and\r\nwas a natural and inevitable one. The lord gained by leasing part of it\r\nto be broken up and cultivated, while, so long as sufficient land was\r\nleft for grazing, the tenants gained by getting land which they could\r\nadd to their holdings, and on which the growing population could settle.\r\nIt must be remembered that the area under cultivation was everywhere an\r\nisland in an ocean of unreclaimed barrenness which cried out for\r\ncolonists.[188] In the Middle Ages land was abundant and men were\r\nscarce; the land wanted the people much more than the people wanted the\r\nland. Moreover, with the simple methods of cultivation prevailing, the\r\nnumber of persons which a villein's holding could maintain was strictly\r\nlimited, and the tendency to \"diminishing returns,\" with the consequent\r\ndifficulty of maintaining a growing population on the same area, must\r\nhave come into play very soon and very sharply. Surveyors[189]\r\nappreciated this, and pointed out on some manors that unless the\r\ntenants' holdings were enlarged they could not make a decent living and,\r\nwhat was more important to the authorities, could not perform the\r\ncustomary services. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that at a\r\ncomparatively early date the manorial population began to overflow the\r\nboundaries of the customary land and to occupy the waste, with the\r\nresult that the area under cultivation grew, in some cases,\r\nenormously.[190] We can hardly be mistaken in supposing that this was\r\nthe chief cause of the remarkable difference in the amount of land which\r\nstrikes one when one compares some of the surveys of later and earlier\r\ndates. In any case the result was to increase the opportunities\r\npossessed by the more prosperous tenants, who could afford to rent\r\nadditional land, of adding to their holdings, and thus to produce a\r\ngrowing inequality in the distribution of property among them.\r\n\r\n    [188] Thorold Rogers _(Agriculture and Prices_, vol. i. p. 34:\r\n    \"Not much less land was regularly under the plough than at\r\n    present\") thinks otherwise. But (i.) modern agriculture has many\r\n    ways of using land besides keeping it \"under the plough\"; (ii.)\r\n    we know that in the eighteenth century large tracts now\r\n    cultivated were barren heaths, and it is difficult to believe\r\n    that these had been cultivated in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n    [189] See below, p. 189. The instances there quoted are later\r\n    than the period with which we are now dealing, but as they\r\n    mostly come from Northumberland, a very conservative county,\r\n    they are perhaps to the point.\r\n\r\n    [190] _e.g._ at South Newton in Wiltshire (see p. 74), tithing\r\n    of Swanthrop in Crondal, where the area of the tenants' holdings\r\n    was in 1287 about 360 acres, and in 1567 about 607 acres, and\r\n    tithing of Crondal, where the area of the tenants' holdings was\r\n    in 1287 about 181, and in 1567 about 284. But these figures are\r\n    not altogether satisfactory; and sometimes one finds a\r\n    reduction, _e.g._ at Dippenhall (from about 287 acres at the\r\n    earlier date to about 275 at the later date). The plague\r\n    relieved the pressure of population, and thus removed one\r\n    incentive for breaking up the waste; on the other hand, it left\r\n    the survivors much better off, and thus more able to increase\r\n    the scale of their husbandry. But until we know much more about\r\n    the growth of population we shall not make much of general\r\n    comparisons of this kind.\r\n\r\nIf the instances which have been given above are at all typical of the\r\nstate of things on many manors, the economic rigidity of rural life in\r\nthe thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries must have been a good\r\ndeal less than is often suggested. The legal forms are stiff and\r\nunchanging, but the life behind them is fluid, and produces all sorts of\r\nnew combinations and arrangements which make legal forms a better index\r\nof what was a hundred years before than of what at any moment is. In\r\nparticular one finds considerable movement going on before the Great\r\nPlague. The more fully manorial records are explored, the more difficult\r\ndoes it seem to generalise about the effects of that great catastrophe.\r\nOne cannot say that it was the beginning of the commutation of labour\r\nservices into rents, for on some manors they were partially commuted\r\nbefore it, and on some they were not entirely commuted till nearly two\r\ncenturies later. One cannot say that the leasing of the demesne was due\r\nto the Plague; for where the labour supply was small, parts of it were\r\nleased already,[191] and after the Plague the authorities of different\r\nmanors met the crisis in different ways, sometimes beginning by letting\r\nthe demesne only to return later to the older system. It may be\r\nsuggested, however, that its influence has been somewhat exaggerated by\r\nthose authorities who would have us regard it as the watershed of\r\neconomic history. No doubt the Great Plague was the single most\r\nimportant event in the economic history of the fourteenth century, just\r\nas the Irish famine of 1846 was the single most important event in the\r\neconomic history of Ireland in the nineteenth century. But neither the\r\nIrish famine nor the Plague had the effect of sweeping economic\r\ndevelopment on to wholly new lines. What they both did was enormously to\r\naccelerate tendencies already at work. The customary tenants were buying\r\nand leasing land from each other before the Plague, and before the\r\nPlague some lords were leasing out their demesnes, but on a small scale.\r\nAfter the Plague the death of many holders and the poverty of many\r\nsurvivors caused land to come into the market on a vastly greater scale\r\nand at a cheaper rate, with the result that the aggregation of holdings,\r\nthe beginnings of which have been described as above, proceeded with\r\nvastly increased rapidity. That this was the case immediately after the\r\nPlague is shown by the familiar entries[192] as to the transference of\r\nholdings which have lost their cultivators in the Court Rolls. The\r\nmovement seems to have continued, however, long after the immediate\r\neffects of the Plague had passed away, and to have resulted on some\r\nmanors in the fifteenth century in something which might almost be\r\ncalled free trade in land. One finds a readiness to buy and sell\r\ncustomary holdings which belies the idea of the manor as a rigid\r\norganisation in which little room was left for changing contractual\r\narrangements, and one finds also the natural result of the rising\r\ncommercialisation of land tenure in the grouping of several holdings\r\nunder one tenant, in the appearance of the practice of some tenants\r\nsub-letting lands to others, and in general in the passing of property\r\nfrom the economically weak to the economically strong, which naturally\r\ndoes not go on rapidly till there is a market in which they both can\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\n    [191] _e.g._ at Hadleigh in 1305 (_Victoria County History_,\r\n    Suffolk, Unwin's article); at Crondal in 1287 (_Crondal\r\n    Records_, p. 110); at Ormsby in 1324 (Massingberd, _History of\r\n    Ormsby_).\r\n\r\n    [192] _e.g._ Scrope, _Castle Combe_, p. 164.

Et\r\n    dictum tenementum concessum est ei ad tam parvam finem eo quod\r\n    dictum tenementum est ruinosum et decassum; et existebat in manu\r\n    domini a tempore pestilentiæ pro defectu emptorum.\" Massingberd,\r\n    Ingoldmells Court Rolls for years 1349?-1352. Gasquet, _The\r\n    Great Pestilence_. Page, _The End of Villeinage in England_.\r\n\r\nAt the same time by the beginning of the fifteenth century another force\r\nof great importance was beginning to operate. The increase in the size\r\nof the customary tenants' holdings, and the growth of a class occupying\r\nmuch more land than the ordinary villein tenancy, was brought about not\r\nonly by encroachment on the waste and the aggregation of holdings, but\r\nalso by the transference to the tenants of that part of the manorial\r\nland which has been the lord's demesne. The process by which the demesne\r\nceased to be cultivated by villein labour, and became frequently an area\r\nsubject to the more elastic arrangements of leasehold tenure, has been\r\noften described, and we shall have to return to it later in speaking of\r\nthe development of the large capitalist farm. Here it is sufficient to\r\npoint out that, the abandonment of the primitive system, by which the\r\ntenants worked out their rents in labour on the demesne, had two\r\nconsequences which are of great significance in the development of the\r\nvillein into the prosperous peasantry of the fifteenth and early\r\nsixteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it meant that one great force making for equality\r\nbetween the holdings of different tenants was removed. The system which\r\ngave each customary tenant on a manor what may be called a standard\r\nholding was surely an artificial one, in the sense that it bears the\r\nmark of deliberate arrangement, and is not one which would tend to be\r\nestablished by the play of economic forces. As we have seen, economic\r\nforces did begin to impair it at an early date. Its persistence is more\r\nremarkable than its disappearance, and why had it persisted? Partly, no\r\ndoubt, because the idea that each full household should be equipped with\r\na standard holding was part of the original organisation of the village\r\ncommunity, upon which the feudal superstructure had been imposed, and\r\nwhich it used as a machine for grinding out its revenue. Partly also\r\nthrough the needs of that superstructure itself. As the tenants were the\r\ninstruments by which the demesne was cultivated, and as the demesne\r\ncould not be cultivated unless the tenants were adequately equipped with\r\nthe means of livelihood, the rough equality which existed between their\r\nholdings, though arising from the communal arrangement of village life,\r\nand not deliberately imposed from above, had, nevertheless, been, in\r\nfact, a quite necessary condition for the working of the lord's private\r\nestate. A settled relation between holdings and services was a\r\nconvenience to the manorial authorities, and in this sense the work done\r\non the demesne was a force tending to keep the tenants' holdings fixed,\r\nas it were, on a scale which did not easily allow of much\r\nvariation.[193] When the demesne ceased to be cultivated by labour\r\nservices, what had been from the point of view of the manorial officers,\r\nthough not from that of the villagers, the chief practical reason for\r\nmaintaining equality between the different holdings disappeared, and the\r\ninequality which economic forces were tending to produce developed more\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\n    [193] The view that the equality of holdings was the creation\r\n    not of the communal needs of the peasantry but of deliberate\r\n    arrangement by the authorities, seems to be untenable in face of\r\n    the evidence of early records showing that freeholders as well\r\n    as the servile peasantry held roughly equal shares (see\r\n    Vinogradoff, _Villainage in England_, Essay II., chap. iv. and\r\n    chap. vi). On the other hand, the apportionment of services to\r\n    holdings tended to stereotype the existing arrangement. A late\r\n    example which displays both elements, that of authoritative\r\n    pressure and that of communal organisation, is supplied by the\r\n    Customary of High Furness (R.O. Duchy of Lancs. Special\r\n    Commissions, No. 398): \"As heretofore dividing and portioning of\r\n    tenements hath caused great decay, chiefly of the service due to\r\n    her Highness for horses, and of her woods, and has been the\r\n    cause of making a great number of poor people in the lordship,\r\n    it is now ordered that no one shall divide his Tenement or\r\n    Tenements among his children, but that the least part shall be\r\n    of the ancient yearly rent to her Highness of 6s. 8d.\" See\r\n    below, p. 101.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, when labour rents were commuted into money, the\r\ndemesne was often added to the tenants' holdings, with the result of\r\nstill further destroying their symmetry, by the opportunity which was\r\ngiven to men with money to buy up parcels of land. This movement went on\r\nso unobtrusively that its significance is liable to be overlooked. In\r\nreality, however, it was a change of very great importance, scarcely\r\nless important than the decay of villein services and disabilities which\r\nwas the other side, the personal as contrasted with the agrarian side,\r\nof the same break up of the old system of cultivation. One must remember\r\nthat the lord's demesne formed a very large part of a great many manors,\r\noften no doubt the most fertile and desirable part. One may recall again\r\nthat there are other European countries in which the sharp distinction\r\nbetween the demesne and the holdings of the peasants was maintained in\r\nfull mediæval vigour almost to our own day. In Prussia,[194] for\r\nexample, a Royal Decree, the Decree of 1807, was needed to break it\r\ndown, and to allow the land held by lords of manors to be bought by the\r\nsmall cultivator. What the partial obliteration of this line meant in\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth century England was that a great deal of land,\r\nland on which the peasantry, one would suppose, had often turned\r\ncovetous eyes, was thrown into the market for families who could afford\r\nit to buy and lease, that for a century or so after the Plague great\r\nestates were being broken up into small, instead of small being\r\nconsolidated into great, that for a century or so the land market turned\r\nin favour of the small man as much as it afterwards turned against\r\nhim.[195]\r\n\r\n    [194] Edict of October 9, 1807, Clause 1.\r\n\r\n    [195] Compare a document, _temp._ Hen. VIII., quoted by Gonner,\r\n    _Common Land and Enclosure_, p. 155 n., which states that\r\n    whereas landlords at one time could not find tenants, now the\r\n    case is altered and tenants want landlords.\r\n\r\nOf course the leasing of the demesne was not universal; nor, when it\r\nwas leased, was it always divided up among the tenants. Often it was\r\ntransferred _en bloc_ to a single farmer, and became the nucleus of the\r\nlarge leasehold farm whose management we shall examine later. Sometimes\r\nit was first divided up and later consolidated again, with results\r\ndisastrous to the interests which had grown up upon it. But the\r\nexistence in the sixteenth century[196] of many small demesne tenancies\r\nis a proof that a common way of treating it was to divide it up among\r\nthe peasants; and if we cast our eyes back over the records of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries we can find many examples to show how\r\nsuch a state of things was brought about. Sometimes small plots of the\r\ndemesne are leased for terms of years. At Tykeford, in 1325,[197] the\r\nsurveyor found that 48 acres of demesne which were then in the hands of\r\nthe lords used to be leased to the tenants. The bailiff's accounts of\r\nthe manor of Amble[198] in Northumberland show that in 1328 \"the\r\nforlands\" were let out to the bondage tenants, and in 1337 four of the\r\nlatter got leases of from 2 to 4 acres of demesne at Acklington.[199] In\r\n1436 at Ambresbury[200] 2 carucates were leased to various tenants for a\r\nterm of years, as well as 8 acres of meadow and 400 acres of pasture;\r\nand at Winterborne[201] 2 carucates, 6 acres of meadow, and 300 acres of\r\npasture were leased in the same year. But in the fifteenth century the\r\nleasing of the demesne was constant, and there is no need to multiply\r\nexamples which can be found in almost every survey of the period. Where\r\nthe land was not leased it was quite usual for it to be held by copy.\r\nThis was a common practice in the fifteenth century in the south-west of\r\nEngland. The surveyor[202] who, in 1568, gave an account of six manors\r\nin the Western counties, found that in all of them the Barton or demesne\r\nhad been split up among the customary tenants for very many years and\r\nwas held by them as copyholders. The same thing happened on the manors\r\nof the Earl of Northumberland, where the tenants' holdings were\r\nincreased by pieces taken from the lord's demesne and divided equally\r\namong them. It happened at South[203] Newton in Wiltshire, where in 1567\r\na good deal of the Barton land was held by the tenants, who were\r\ncopyholders, on the same terms as the rest of their customary holdings;\r\nat Stovard,[204] and Childhampton,[205] and Estoverton,[206] where the\r\ncustomary tenants held \"Bordland.\" Very probably those pieces of the\r\ndemesne which on some manors were held by copy of Court Roll, had\r\noriginally been let on lease in the way described above. The difficulty\r\nof distinguishing them was very great, since normally they would lie in\r\nthe open fields scattered among the strips which formed the customary\r\nholdings, in such a way that the movement of a balk obliterated the\r\ndifference. It is not surprising, therefore, that in spite of the\r\nefforts of the lord's officials, they should constantly have lost their\r\nidentity. The remarkable thing is that they retained it so often, and\r\nthat surveyors were able to pin down a couple of acres among 30 or 40\r\nothers as not being, like the rest, customary land, but as having at one\r\ntime, perhaps several generations before, been parts of the lord's\r\ndemesne which it is \"good to revyve and keep in memory that it should\r\nnot hereafter decay, but that at all tymes it may be devyded from the\r\ncustomarye.\"[207]\r\n\r\n    [196] For the use of the demesne in the sixteenth century see\r\n    below, pp. 200?-213.\r\n\r\n    [197] Dugdale,_Monasticon_, vol. v., Survey of Tykeford.\r\n\r\n    [198] _Northumberland County History_, vol. v., Amble: \"4s. 8d.\r\n    de forlands dimissis diversis tenentibus.\" \"4 acres leased by\r\n    the Prior for 8 years to Roger at 8d. per acre.\"\r\n\r\n    [199] _Ibid._, vol. v., Acklington.\r\n\r\n    [200] Hoare, _History of Wiltshire_, Hundred of Ambresbury.\r\n\r\n    [201] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [202] Humberstone, _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i. p. 43.\r\n    See below, pp. 208?-209.\r\n\r\n    [203] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Lands of William, First Earl\r\n    of Pembroke_ (Straton).\r\n\r\n    [204] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [205] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [206] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [207] _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i., Survey of the\r\n    Manor of Whitforde in the County of Devon.\r\n\r\nWith these words, so suggestive of the blurring of lines which in\r\nprevious ages were sharply drawn, we may pause to consider where we\r\nstand. Our argument has aimed at showing the large changes which have\r\ntaken place in the position of the peasantry as landholders before the\r\nagrarian revolution of the sixteenth century begins. We have not been\r\nable to give any quantitative measurements of the developments. But we\r\nhave seen enough to understand the direction in which economic forces\r\nare setting. The substitution of hired labour for villein services, and\r\nthe formation of a middle class of considerable landholders out of the\r\noccupiers of virgates and semi-virgates who formed the bulk of the\r\npopulation on most mediæval manors, are changes which have taken place\r\nquietly and which have nothing sensational about them. But the growth of\r\nrelationships based on a cash nexus between individuals, which they both\r\nimply, has effected a very real alteration in rural conditions, an\r\nalteration which is in a small way like that occurring to-day when the\r\ndiscovery that a quiet village possesses mineral wealth or is a\r\nconvenient holiday resort puts money into circulation there, causes\r\nfarming lands to be cut up into plots which are bought by the savings of\r\nspeculative tradesmen, and adds a new tangle of commercial relationships\r\nto the slowly moving economy of village life. Speculation in land on a\r\nsmall scale begins among the more prosperous villeins at an early date,\r\nas the inevitable result of an increase in prosperity and of the land\r\nhunger of a growing population. It is immensely accelerated through the\r\nimpetus which the plague, by emptying holdings of their occupants, gives\r\nto the formation of something like a land market, and the result is that\r\nthe holdings of the more fortunate grow and the holdings of the less\r\nfortunate diminish. As a consequence, there is in many fifteenth century\r\nvillages the greatest variety in the economic conditions of the\r\npeasantry. Except where commercial forces have been held in check by the\r\nremoteness of the township from centres of trade, or where the needs of\r\nthe manorial authorities oblige them to resist any subdivision of\r\nholdings for fear it should lead to the loss of services, the\r\ncomparative uniformity characteristic of their holdings in the\r\nthirteenth century has disappeared, and the equality in poverty of the\r\nmodern agricultural labourer has not yet taken its place. Though the old\r\nAdam of economic enterprise seems to be banished by the insistence of\r\nstewards and bailiffs that holdings which are responsible for certain\r\nworks shall be treated as an indivisible unity, he sneaks back, even in\r\nthe mediæval manor, in the shape of agreements among the peasantry,\r\nagreements which break that unity up by way of exchange, of sale, of\r\nleasing, and sub-letting. By the end of the fifteenth century the\r\ndifferent elements in rural society are spread, as it were, along a more\r\nextended scale, and there is a much wider gap between those who are\r\nmost, and those who are least, successful.\r\n\r\nTaken together these changes mean, on the whole, an upward movement, an\r\nincrease in the opportunities possessed by the peasantry of advancing\r\nthemselves by purchasing and leasing land, more mobility, more\r\nenterprise, greater scope for the man who has saved money and wishes to\r\ninvest it. They mean that custom and authority have less influence and\r\nthat class distinctions based upon tenure are weakened. But the upward\r\ncurve may turn and descend; for they imply also a tendency towards the\r\ndissolution of fixed customary arrangements and of the protection which\r\nthey offer against revolutionary changes, a tendency which in the\r\nfuture, when great landowners and capitalists turn their attentions to\r\ndiscovering the most profitable methods of farming, may damage the very\r\nmen who have gained by it in the past. In the next two chapters we shall\r\nglance at the first point, and pause at greater length upon the second:\r\nfirst, the economic condition of the mass of the peasantry before the\r\ngreat agrarian movements of the sixteenth century begin; secondly, the\r\nsigns of coming change which may react to their disadvantage. We shall\r\ntry to maintain the standpoint of an observer in the early years of the\r\nsixteenth century. But economic periods overlap, and Northumberland is\r\nstill in the Middle Ages when Middlesex is in the eighteenth century. So\r\nwe shall not hesitate to use evidence drawn from sources that are in\r\npoint of time far apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE PEASANTRY (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) _The Economic Environment of the Small Cultivator_\r\n\r\nIt was the argument of the previous chapter that the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries saw the emergence from the mass of manorial tenants\r\nof a class of wealthy peasants who bought and leased their neighbours'\r\nlands, added to their property parcels taken from the waste and demesne,\r\nand by these means built up estates far exceeding in size the normal\r\nvillein holding. The change from labour services to money rents left the\r\npeasantry with time for the management of larger holdings, and the\r\nspread of a money economy increased their means of acquiring them. Cheap\r\nland and easy transfer favour the movement of property from one man to\r\nanother. In the manorial courts transfer was easy, and, especially after\r\nthe Great Plague, land was cheap. It is not necessary to take sides in\r\nthe much debated question of the economic conditions of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, in order to hold that, on the whole, such changes made the\r\ngreater part of it a period of increasing prosperity among the small\r\ncultivators. To support this view one could quote Fortescue's[208] proud\r\ndescription of the well-being of the common people. One could point out\r\nthat in the dark days in the middle of the sixteenth century the\r\npeasants themselves looked back to the social conditions of the reign of\r\nHenry VII.[209] as a kind of golden age, and clamoured for their\r\nrestoration. One could cite a good many examples pointing to an upward\r\nmovement. Large estates are left at death by men who are legally\r\nvilleins. Villeins, especially in the eastern counties, buy up freehold\r\nland and found considerable properties. A bond tenant in Lincolnshire\r\nmarries into a knight's family. Bond tenants are found leasing the\r\nmanorial demesne in one block and farming estates of several hundred\r\nacres. Nor must we forget that the peasants of the sixteenth century are\r\noften very substantial people, and that even when the taint of personal\r\nvilleinage is still upon them.\r\n\r\n    [208] Fortescue on the Governance of England (Plummer), chapter\r\n    xii.: \"But oure commons be riche, and therefore thai give to\r\n    thair kynge, at somme times quinsimes and dessimes, and ofte\r\n    tymes other grate subsidies.\"\r\n\r\n    [209] Russell, _Ket's Rebellion in Norfolk_, p. 48 foll.; see\r\n    passage quoted below, pp. 335?-337. For the sentences\r\n    immediately following, see Scrope, _History of the Manor and\r\n    Barony of Castle Combe_, p. 233: \"A serf ... is said to have\r\n    left at his death in 1435 chattels estimated at 3000 marks or\r\n    £2000.\" Massingberd, Ingoldmells Court Rolls, int. xxix.;\r\n    Davenport, _History of a Norfolk Manor_, p. 53.\r\n\r\nBut isolated instances of this kind, suggestive though they are, are not\r\nlikely to carry conviction unless they agree with what we know of the\r\ngeneral economic situation. Economists who live after the days of Samuel\r\nSmiles will hesitate before they base optimistic conclusions as to the\r\nconditions of any class on cases of good fortune among individual\r\nmembers of it. We should be false to the spirit of our period if we did\r\nnot recognise that the economic ideal of most men, an ideal often\r\nimplied though not often formulated, was less the opening of avenues to\r\nenterprise than the maintenance of groups and communities at their\r\ncustomary level of prosperity. We shall have hereafter to speak of the\r\nchanges which overtook the English social system in the course of the\r\nsixteenth century, in so far as they were connected with changes in the\r\nmethods of agriculture and of land tenure. Before we do so we may pause\r\nfor a moment to look at the village of the later Middle Ages as a social\r\nand economic unit.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of its whole life is the possession by the majority of\r\nhouseholds of holdings of land. Land is so widely distributed that the\r\nhousehold, all of whose members are entirely dependent for their living\r\nupon work for wages, is the exception. Though this cannot be\r\nstatistically proved, it is rendered almost certain by several\r\nconverging lines of evidence. Turn first to the table on pp. 64 and 65,\r\nwhich sets out the acreage of the customary tenants' holdings. It will\r\nbe seen that, when all the counties represented are grouped together,\r\nthe tenants who have only cottages form less than one-tenth of the total\r\nnumber. In East Anglia and in Lancashire the proportion, it is true, is\r\nconsiderably higher; but these counties are exceptions to the general\r\nrule, and the cottagers usually have gardens, which, if they do not\r\namount to the minimum of four acres laid down by the Act of 1589, are\r\nnevertheless not infrequently of one or two acres in extent. If we may\r\ntrust these figures, the typical family has a small holding of from two\r\nand a half to fifteen acres. Our second line of evidence quite falls in\r\nwith this conclusion. It is clear from the tone of legislation that the\r\nclass of workers who depend solely on a contract of service is in\r\nsixteenth century England not very large. Elizabethan[210] legislation\r\nprovides expressly for the needs of farmers by empowering Justices of\r\nthe Peace to apprentice unoccupied youths to husbandry, and to set the\r\nunemployed to work in the fields. Even in the middle of the\r\nseventeenth[211] century, when a strong movement has been at work for\r\none hundred and fifty years in the opposite direction, there are\r\ncomplaints from pamphleteers that men who should work as wage-labourers\r\ncling to the soil, and in the naughtiness of their hearts prefer\r\nindependence as squatters to employment by a master. Such comments throw\r\na flash of light on the way in which the peasants regard the\r\nalternatives of wage labour and landholding. Sometimes they themselves\r\ngive us a glimpse into their mind on the matter. They tell us how they\r\nface that most fundamental of economic problems, the Achilles' heel of\r\nmodern civilisation, the problem of so arranging their little societies\r\nthat as many persons as possible may enter life with some material\r\nequipment for self-maintenance in addition to their personal strength\r\nand skill. Here is an extract from a customary of the Lancashire manor\r\nof High Furness[212] drawn up in the reign of Elizabeth:--\r\n\r\n\"As heretofore deviding and porcioning of tenements hath caused great\r\ndecay, chiefly of the service due to her Highness for horses and of her\r\nwoods, and has been the cause of making a great number of poor people in\r\nthe lordship, it is now ordered that no one shall devide his tenement or\r\ntenements among his children, but that the least part shall be of\r\nancient yearly rent to her Highness of 6s. 8d., and that before every\r\nsuch division there shall be several houses and ousettes for every part\r\nof such tenement.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems a hard rule. Will it not result in the creation of a body of\r\npropertyless labourers employed by a small village aristocracy? That\r\ndanger is appreciated, and is dealt with in the clauses which follow:--\r\n\r\n\"If any customary tenant die seized of a customary tenement, having no\r\nson but a daughter, or daughters, then the eldest daughter being\r\npreferred in marriage shall have the tenement as his next heir, and she\r\nshall pay to her younger sister, if she have but one sister, 20 years\r\nancient rent, as is answered to her Majesty; and if she have more than\r\none sister she shall pay 40 years ancient rent to be equally divided\r\namong them....\r\n\r\n\"For the avoiding of great trouble in the agreement with younger\r\nbrothers, it is now ordered that the eldest son shall pay to his\r\nbrothers in the form following:--If there is but one brother, 12 years\r\nancient rent; if there are two brothers, 16 years ancient rent to be\r\nequally divided.\r\n\r\n\"If there be three or more, 20 years ancient rent to be equally divided.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas great inconvenience has grown by certain persons that at the\r\nmarriage of son or daughter have promised their tenement to the same son\r\nor daughter and their heirs, according to the custom of the manor, and\r\nafterwards put the tenement away to another person; it is ordered that\r\nwhatever tenements a tenant shall promise to the son or daughter being\r\nhis sole heir apparent at the time of his or her marriage, the same\r\nought to come to them according to the same covenant, which ought to be\r\nshowed at the next court.\"\r\n\r\n    [210] Statute of Artificers, 5 Eliz. c. 4.\r\n\r\n    [211] See below, pp. 277?-279, and _Hist. MSS. Com._, Cd. 784,\r\n    pp. 322?-323. Presentment by the grand jury, Worcestershire,\r\n    1661, April 23: \"We desire that servants' wages may be rated\r\n    according to the statute, for we find the unreasonableness of\r\n    servants' wages a great grievance, so that the servants are\r\n    grown so proud and idle that the master cannot be known from the\r\n    servant except it be because the servant wears better clothes\r\n    than his master. We desire that the statute for setting poor\r\n    men's children to apprenticeship be more duly observed, for we\r\n    find the usual course is that if any are apprenticed it is to\r\n    some paltry trade, and when they have served their\r\n    apprenticeship they are not able to live by their trades,\r\n    whereby not being bred to labour they are not fit for husbandry.\r\n    We therefore desire that such children may be set to husbandry\r\n    for the benefit of tillage and the good of the Commonwealth.\"\r\n    See also Britannia Languens (1680) for remarks on the scarcity\r\n    of labour even at the end of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n    [212] R.O. Duchy of Lancaster, Special Commissions, No. 398.\r\n\r\nThe motive of the first rule is a mixed one. Its object is partly to\r\nobviate the risk that the Crown, which is lord, of the manor, may lose\r\nits services if holdings are too much subdivided, partly to prevent the\r\nappearance of a class which has too little land for a living. The motive\r\nof the other rules is to ensure that the custom of primogeniture, which\r\nobtains among the customary tenants on this manor, shall not result in\r\nthe creation of a propertyless proletariat. Holdings are not to be\r\ndivided. But the payment to other members of the family of a sum ranging\r\nfrom about one-half to more than the whole of their capital value is\r\nmade a charge upon them, and with that money they can purchase land\r\nelsewhere, or take, like the French peasant girl, a considerable _dot_\r\nto their husbands. Sue,[213] the daughter of Old Carter, the rich\r\nyeoman, whose security for the marriage-portion \"shall be present\r\npayment, because Bonds and Bills are but Tarriers to catch fools, and\r\nkeep lazy knaves busy,\" was a match for whom gentlemen's sons were\r\nwilling enough to compete.\r\n\r\n    [213] See Dekker's _The Witch of Edmonton_. I have ventured to\r\n    assume that in this play \"yeoman\" is used in its wide\r\n    non-technical sense.\r\n\r\nThese groups of from ten to a hundred households which constitute the\r\nordinary village of southern and middle England, form small democracies\r\nof property holders, who are of course under the authority of a lord,\r\nbut whose subjection does not prevent them from exercising considerable\r\ncontrol over the management of their own economic affairs, nor impose\r\nany effective bar on those individuals who have the means and capacity\r\nto advance themselves. We can watch them arranging[214] the course of\r\nagriculture, deciding when the pastures at Wolsyke and Willoughbybroke\r\nare to be \"broken,\" imposing fines on those who encroach on the several\r\npasture land, throwing open the Pesefield on Holy Thursday to the\r\nvillage horses, shutting them out of Street headlands for fear of the\r\n\"stroyinge of Korn,\" making charitable provision for gleaners who cannot\r\nwork, punishing those who ought to work but in their depravity would\r\nrather glean. We can observe how the wide distribution of land gives an\r\nopportunity to a humble family to better itself by judicious husbandry\r\nand well-calculated purchases. True, the peasant's land is no longer\r\nheld in approximately equal shares as generally as it had been in the\r\nthirteenth century. The growth of a money economy, the withdrawal of the\r\nlevelling pressure of villeinage, the growth of population, has in the\r\nmore progressive parts of the country left a gap into which\r\nindividualising commercial forces wind themselves in the way which has\r\nalready been described. But these changes are important mainly as\r\nprecursors of more extensive innovations. As yet they have done little\r\nmore than make tiny breaches in the wall of custom. They have enabled\r\nindividuals to rise from the general level into positions of comparative\r\naffluence. They have not proceeded so far as to enable the successful to\r\nexercise a decisive direction over the economic affairs of their\r\nfellows. Though Northumberland is exceptional in the way in which down\r\nto the very end of the sixteenth century it preserves its system of\r\nstandardised holdings, it is none the less true that all the petty land\r\nspeculation, whose operations we have traced above, has not the effect\r\nof producing any very large changes in the distribution of property. If,\r\nwhen compared with its condition two hundred years before, the village\r\nof our period shows remarkable irregularity, it offers precisely an\r\nopposite aspect to the observer who compares it as it is then with its\r\ncondition two hundred years later. The gaps which have appeared between\r\nthe holdings mark the disintegrating influence of economic enterprise;\r\nbut they are gaps which enterprise can span, and the graduation of\r\nholdings from the two or three acres of the humblest to the fifty or\r\nsixty acres of the most prosperous, together with the abundance of\r\nunoccupied land, supplies a kind of staircase along which in the country\r\nthe younger son can travel from the position of a labourer to that of a\r\nsmall holder, as he does in the towns from apprentice to\r\nmaster-craftsman. From this point of view the characteristic\r\n_morcellement_ of holdings, so bitterly denounced by economists who,\r\nlike Arthur Young, approached the problem from the point of view of the\r\nlarge farmer, was a positive advantage. It meant that land could be\r\nbought and sold, as it were, retail. It meant that the labourer could\r\nbegin with one strip of land of half an acre, and add other strips to it\r\nas he worked his way up. It meant that even the humblest peasant usually\r\nhad some live-stock of his own; for even the smallest customary holding\r\nusually carried with it rights of common. Such conditions are, of\r\ncourse, no safeguard against poverty. No doubt there were plenty of\r\npeople like Widow Quin, whose \"leaky thatch is growing more pasture for\r\nher buck goat than her square of fields.\"[215] But they are a safeguard\r\nagainst destitution, and indeed against any complete loss of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n    [214] See _e.g. Hist. MSS. Com._, Cd. 5567, pp. 106-?107, and\r\n    below, pp. 159-?162.\r\n\r\n    [215] Synge, _The Playboy of the Western World_.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to a part of England where something like the open field\r\nsystem survives to this day, and ask the inhabitants what they think of\r\nit. In the so-called Isle of Axholme there are still common fields with\r\nintermixed strips. Here is the evidence[216] which a body of labourers\r\nthere sent into a Select Committee of Parliament in 1899: \"We, the\r\nundersigned, being agricultural labourers at Epworth, are in occupation\r\nof allotments or small holdings, varying from two roods to three acres,\r\nand willingly testify to the great benefit we find from our holdings.\r\nWhere we have sufficient quantity of land to grow two roods each of\r\nwheat, barley, and potatoes, we have bread, beans, and potatoes for a\r\ngreat part of the year, enabling us to face a long winter without the\r\ndread of hunger or pauperism staring us in the face.\" One of the tests\r\nby which the economic prosperity of a community may be measured is its\r\nsuccess in preventing the appearance of a residual population, which\r\ncannot fit itself into the moving mechanism of industry without\r\nceaseless friction and maladjustments. In most villages before extensive\r\nevictions begin that mechanism moves very slowly; property is widely\r\ndiffused, and the residuum must have been small. That there was often\r\ndistress through bad harvests and pestilence is certain. But was there\r\nmuch of the economic helplessness, more terrible than physical distress\r\nitself, which is the normal lot of most of the propertyless wage-earners\r\nof the modern world? We hesitate to say. Hesitation on such a point may\r\nperhaps be counted to our peasants for righteousness.[217]\r\n\r\n    [216] Quoted by Slater, _The English Peasantry and the Enclosure\r\n    of Common Fields_, pp. 58?-59. He remarks \"a labourer ... begins\r\n    with one 'land,' then takes a second, a third, and so on,\" and\r\n    quotes Mr. Haggard's statement that the \"Isle of Axholme ... is\r\n    one of the few places ... in England ... truly prosperous in an\r\n    agricultural sense.\"\r\n\r\n    [217] Customs like those of High Furness, together with the\r\n    complaints as to the scarcity of agricultural labour, make one\r\n    reflect on a fundamental question of economics, viz., the\r\n    average age of marriage and its relation to the distribution of\r\n    property and organisation of industry. It is well known that the\r\n    age of marriage is influenced by (among other things) the age at\r\n    which maximum earning power begins, _e.g._ to-day it is lower\r\n    for the unskilled labourer than for the artisan, for the former\r\n    reaches his prime earlier than the latter; lower for the artisan\r\n    than for the professional man, because the latter takes longer\r\n    than the former in getting together a practice or rising from a\r\n    low initial salary. The difference is not primarily due to\r\n    differences of thrift or foresight as between different classes,\r\n    but to the fact that the deferring of marriage, which is prudent\r\n    in (say) a lawyer, who does not reach his full earning power\r\n    till thirty-five or later, is imprudent in (say) an engineer who\r\n    has all the experience he needs at twenty-six or twenty-seven,\r\n    and still more imprudent in the labourer, who reaches his full\r\n    earning power at twenty-one or twenty-two, and in whom it falls\r\n    off rapidly after he has passed the prime of life. When a large\r\n    number of agricultural and industrial workers (in the sixteenth\r\n    century probably a majority) were small landholders or small\r\n    masters, did the fact that they had to wait for the death of a\r\n    parent to succeed to their holding, or (in towns) for the\r\n    permission of a guild to set up shop (_i.e._ to reach their\r\n    maximum earning powers) tend to defer the age of marriage? If\r\n    the possibility of this being the case is conceded, ought we to\r\n    connect the slow growth of population between 1377 and 1500 (on\r\n    which all historians seem to be agreed) with the wide\r\n    distribution of property, and ought we to think of the\r\n    considerable increase in the landless proletariate which took\r\n    place in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as tending in\r\n    the opposite direction? In the absence of statistics we cannot\r\n    answer these questions. But I am inclined to argue that they are\r\n    at any rate worth investigation. (i) Contemporary opinion shows\r\n    that in the eyes of sixteenth century writers the problem of\r\n    population was a problem of underpopulation. The prevalent fear\r\n    is \"lack of men\" for military purposes. Starkey's Dialogue\r\n    speaks of it as \"a consumption of the body politic,\" and\r\n    suggests as remedies to allow priests to marry, to forbid\r\n    gentlemen to employ more serving men than they are able to \"set\r\n    forward\" to matrimony (on the ground that \"men whych in service\r\n    spend theyr lyfe never fynd means to marry\"), to endow with a\r\n    house and a portion of waste land at a nominal rent persons who\r\n    marry, to exempt from taxation all persons who have five\r\n    children and less than a hundred marks in goods, to tax\r\n    bachelors 1s. in the pound, and give the proceeds to \"them which\r\n    have more children than they be wel abul to nurysch, and partely\r\n    to the dote of poor damosellys and vyrgins\" (Part II. p. 8).\r\n    Hales (p. lv. of Miss Lamond's introduction to _Commonweal of\r\n    England_) speaks of depopulation in a similar strain, as also\r\n    does Harrison forty years later. There are some complaints as to\r\n    excess of population in 1620 (see below, pp. 278?-279), but\r\n    these do not become general till the very end of the seventeenth\r\n    century (see Defoe, _Giving alms no charity_). (ii) The position\r\n    of a son who acquires a holding when his parent dies is\r\n    analogous to that of an apprentice who cannot set up as a master\r\n    till given permission by the proper authorities. It is quite\r\n    plain that in the eyes of the ordinary man in the sixteenth\r\n    century one of the advantages of a system of compulsory\r\n    apprenticeship was that it prevented youths marrying at a very\r\n    early age. _E.g._ an Act (2 & 3 Philip and Mary) forbids the\r\n    admitting of any one to the freedom of the city of London before\r\n    the age of twenty-four, and enacts that apprentices are not to\r\n    be taken so young that they will come out of their time before\r\n    they are twenty-four. The reason alleged for this rule is the\r\n    distress in the city of which \"one of the chief occasions is by\r\n    reason of the overhasty marriages and over soon setting up of\r\n    householdes by the young folke of the city ... be they never so\r\n    young and unskilful.\" A petition of weavers states (_Hist. MSS.\r\n    Com._, C.D. 784, p. 114): \"Whereas by the former good laws of\r\n    their trade no one could exercise the same until he had served\r\n    an apprenticeship for seven years and attained the age of\r\n    twenty-four, now in these disordered times many apprentices\r\n    having forsaken parents and masters ... refuse to serve out\r\n    their time, but before they are eighteen or twenty years old\r\n    betake themselves to marriage.\" One may contrast the\r\n    extraordinary reduction in the age of marriage of the people of\r\n    Lancashire brought about by the early factory system, with its\r\n    armies of operatives who had nothing to look forward to but the\r\n    wages earned immediately on reaching maturity (Gaskell,\r\n    _Artisans and Machinery_, 1836, and _The Manufacturing\r\n    Population of Great Britain_, 1833), and compare the results\r\n    usually ascribed to the wide distribution of landed property in\r\n    France. See also the remarks of Slater on the effect of the\r\n    eighteenth century enclosing (_The English Peasantry and the\r\n    Enclosure of the Common Fields_, p. 256), and Hasbach, _History\r\n    of the English Agricultural Labourer_, pp. 120 n. 138-?139, 178.\r\n    Young ascribed \"a great multiplication of births\" to the fact\r\n    that \"the labourer has no advancement to hope\" (_Suffolk_, 1797,\r\n    p. 260); Duncombe, \"The practice of consolidating farms ...\r\n    tends to licentiousness of manners\" (_Herefordshire_, p. 33). A\r\n    witness before the Select Committee on Emigration, 1827, stated,\r\n    \"The labourers no longer live in farm houses as they used to do,\r\n    where they were better fed and had more comforts than they now\r\n    get in a cottage, in consequence there was not the same\r\n    inducement to early marriage\" (_qu._ 3882). In the absence of\r\n    direct statistical evidence all we can say is (i) that when\r\n    persons look forward to entering on property or setting up as\r\n    small masters their point of maximum earning power is later than\r\n    it is when they can earn the standard rate of the trade at\r\n    twenty-two or twenty-three; therefore (ii) that the average age\r\n    of marriage is likely to be higher in a society composed largely\r\n    of small property owners than in one composed largely of a\r\n    propertyless proletariate.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, let us examine the use which the peasants make of\r\ntheir holdings. Modern writers tell us that among the conditions\r\nnecessary to the prosperity of a class of small holders the most\r\nimportant are a wise choice of the kind of farming to be pursued, a\r\nsound organisation of credit, cheap marketing, and rural bye-employments\r\nto back agriculture. Modern writers who are not English would probably\r\nadd a tariff on imported agricultural produce. In our period the type of\r\ncultivation pursued by the large farmer was undergoing rapid changes.\r\nThat of the peasantry was hardly a matter of choice. It was dictated by\r\nthe necessity, under which most villages still lay, of being largely\r\nself-supporting in the matter of corn supplies, a necessity recognised\r\nand crystallised in the customary routine of village husbandry. The\r\npreponderance of arable farming among the peasantry is illustrated by\r\nthe table[218] on page 107, which should be contrasted with that given\r\non pages 225?-226.\r\n\r\nThe figures in this table do not pretend to complete accuracy. But they\r\nindicate the distribution of land between different uses with sufficient\r\ncorrectness to show the sort of agriculture followed by the small holder\r\nof our period. They prove unmistakably that his standby was the grain\r\ncrops grown on the open fields.[219] Students of rural conditions will\r\nbe quick to recognise the contrast which the picture offers to the\r\neconomy of the modern small holder. In our own day the breaking up of\r\nlarge farms into smaller tenancies has proceeded furthest in those parts\r\nof the country which are most suitable for pasture. The occupier of a\r\nholding of less than 70 or 80 acres usually relies mainly on stock\r\nfarming in one form or another, and on the growing of vegetables and\r\nfruit. Corn-growing he leaves to much larger men, and, when he does grow\r\ngrain, he does so mainly to provide fodder and straw for his beasts. In\r\nthe sixteenth century almost exactly the opposite was the case. In so\r\nfar as the large farmer with 200 or 300 acres can be said to have had a\r\nspecialty, it was not corn-growing but sheep and cattle grazing. The\r\nsmall man relied mainly, though not entirely, upon tillage, and though,\r\neven in his case, pasture farming assumed increased importance as the\r\ncentury went on, grazing was chiefly a supplement to arable farming. To\r\nthis statement there are of course certain exceptions. Though villages\r\nwhere the customary tenants hold more pasture than arable are rare, they\r\nare not unknown, and occasionally one finds one where large numbers of\r\ntenants of the most diverse economic conditions, with pasture holdings\r\nranging from 6 to 100 acres, have no arable at all. Sometimes such an\r\narrangement is to be accounted for by the fact that a part of the\r\ndemesne lands of the manor, which happens not to be suitable for\r\ntillage, has been divided up among the population of younger sons and\r\nlabourers who have no holdings in the open fields. In the neighbourhood\r\nof considerable towns, again, there was a market[220] for vegetables and\r\ndairy produce which gave an impetus to this side of agriculture, and the\r\nhome counties poured butter and cheese, fowls, eggs, and fruit into\r\nLondon, as France and the Channel Islands do at the present day. Still,\r\nto speak broadly, the small holder of the sixteenth century, unlike the\r\nsmall holder of the twentieth, was before all things interested in\r\narable farming, and interested in rights of pasture chiefly as a\r\nnecessary adjunct to it.\r\n\r\nTABLE V\r\n\r\n  +-----------+---------------+--------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n  |Manors     |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |(excluding |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |houses,    |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |orchards,  |  total area.  |    arable.   |   meadow.   |  pasture.    |\r\n  |garths,    |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |_&c._).    |               |              |             |              |\r\n  +-----------+---------------+--------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n  |           | ac. ro.   po. | ac. ro.  po. |ac. ro.  po. |ac. ro. po.   |\r\n  |four in    |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |northumber-|               |              |             |              |\r\n  |land and   |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |one in     |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |lancashire |1730  3  13-1/4|1533  2 32-3/4| 98  1  6-1/8| 98  3   14   |\r\n  |           |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |seven in   |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |wiltshire  |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |and one    |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |in dorset  |3963  2    0   |3636  3    0  |124  3    0  |202 (in close |\r\n  |           |               |              |             |    plus      |\r\n  |           |               |              |             |    consid-   |\r\n  |           |               |              |             |    erable    |\r\n  |           |               |              |             |    rights of |\r\n  |           |               |              |             |    pasture   |\r\n  |           |               |              |             |    not       |\r\n  |           |               |              |             |    expressed |\r\n  |           |               |              |             |    in acres).|\r\n  |four in    |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |midlands   |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |(bedford,  |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |leicester, |               |              |             |              |\r\n  |northants, |               |              |             |ac. ro. po.   |\r\n  |stafford)  |2092  3    2   |1670  2   17  | 167 3 32    |254  0   33   |\r\n  +-----------+---------------+--------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n    [218] See Appendix II.\r\n\r\n    [219] It must be remembered, however, that there was pasture on\r\n    the one field which every year lay fallow, and that the amount\r\n    of this does not appear in the figures given below.\r\n\r\n    [220] Camden Society, Norden, Speculum Britanniæ, Part I.,\r\n    Intro.: \"And these commonly are so furnished with kyne that\r\n    their wives twice or thrice a week conveyeth to London mylke and\r\n    butter, cheese, apples, pears, frutmentye, hens and chickens,\r\n    baken, and other country drugs ... and this yieldeth them a\r\n    large comfort and relief.\"\r\n\r\nCorn-growing in England has been for the last hundred years a branch of\r\nfarming so completely surrendered to the large capitalist, that it is\r\nnot easy to realise a state of things in which the typical corn-grower\r\nwas a man with less than 60 acres, and a man who could make a good\r\nliving from a holding of that size. To understand the economics of his\r\nposition we must think away the conditions which have in the last\r\ncentury made it intolerable. Or rather we must think away all except\r\none. That one was the perennial problem of agricultural credit. In this\r\nmatter, certainly, the poorer among the peasantry suffered as their\r\nsuccessors all over the world suffer to-day. They were apt to be in the\r\ngrip of the moneylender. Cheap land, as the modern colonist knows, is of\r\nlittle avail to the man who has not the capital needed to stock it, and\r\nto carry over the interval between harvest and harvest, when his\r\nreceipts fall off but his expenses continue. In the endless arguments\r\nwhich took place on the ethics of moneylending at a later date, it was a\r\ncommon complaint that village financiers drove a hard bargain with the\r\npeasants whom misfortune compelled to resort to them. In a backward\r\nvillage the only man with capital to lend might be the local\r\ncorn-dealer, brewer, or maltster, the large farmer who held the lord's\r\ndemesne, or the lord of the manor himself and his agent. Like an\r\nAmerican farmer in the grip of an \"elevator,\" the peasant who wanted\r\nmoney for his crops had often to sell them to a dealer[221] who gave a\r\nridiculously low price for them, and then made an enormous profit by\r\nholding them till the price of corn rose, or by sending them to a market\r\nwhere there was a scarcity. Lords[222] of manors, it was said, helped\r\ntheir tenants out of temporary difficulties by advancing them small\r\nsums, and then used their advantage to screw extra labour on the demesne\r\nout of them. Manor courts[223] in the Middle Ages had fined villagers\r\nfor usury, but one may suspect that these were capitalists too potent\r\nfor them to control, and one does not wonder at the headshakings of the\r\nprudent Fitzherbert over the man whose method of farming compels him to\r\nbe a borrower. The form which charity and co-operative effort took\r\npoints in the same direction. Hospitals[224] and monasteries advance\r\nmoney to buy seed. Well-to-do men aid their relatives by stocking their\r\nfarms for them. Gilds[225] make loans of cattle and sheep, and the last\r\nlegacy of a philanthropic parson to his parishioners is money with which\r\nto buy a cow for the poor. How far the charitable and corporate\r\norganisation of loans succeeded in keeping the small cultivator out of\r\nthe clutches of the usurer, and how far the dissolution of the\r\nmonasteries and the confiscation of part of the Gild lands deteriorated\r\ntheir condition by placing them more at his mercy, are questions which\r\ndeserve consideration but which we have not sufficient evidence to\r\nanswer.[226] In forming any estimate, however, of rural conditions, the\r\nhand to mouth economy of the poorer peasants, and their consequent\r\nhelplessness in the face of any unexpected catastrophe, such as an\r\nunusually bad harvest, a cattle plague, and (in the fifteenth century)\r\nthe destruction of crops by civil disturbances, must not be forgotten.\r\nIn that age less capital was needed to stock a holding than in our own,\r\nbut it was scraped together with even greater difficulty. On the very\r\neve of the dissolution of the monasteries there were some remote manors\r\nwhere \"Money was so scantie that coigned leather went bargaining between\r\nman and man,\"[227] and where corn rents were substituted for money\r\nbecause the tenants had no money in which rent could be paid.\r\n\r\n    [221] See _The Death of Usury or the Disgrace of Usurers_, 1594:\r\n    \"It is a common practice in this country, if a poore man come to\r\n    borrow money of a maltster, he will not lend any, but tells him,\r\n    if he will sell some barley, he will give him after the order of\r\n    fore-hand buyers; the man being driven by distresse sells his\r\n    corn far under foote, that when it comes to be delivered he\r\n    loses halfe in halfe, oftentimes double the value. I have heard\r\n    many of these fore-hand sellers say that they had rather allow\r\n    after 20 pounds in the hundred for money, than to sell their\r\n    fore-hand bargaines of corn. These are most extreme usurers.\"\r\n\r\n    [222] _A Discourse upon Usurie_, by Thomas Wilson, 1584: \"A lord\r\n    doth lend his tenants money, with this condition that they shall\r\n    plough his land, whether doth he commit usurie or no? I do\r\n    answer that if he does not pay them for their labour, but will\r\n    take the benefit of their labour for the use of his money, he is\r\n    an usurer.\"\r\n\r\n    [223] _Hist. MSS.

MSS. Com._, Cd.\r\n    784, p. 46.\r\n\r\n    [226] On the subject of the monasteries see Gasquet, _Henry\r\n    VIII. and the English Monasteries_, chap. xxii., and _passim_.\r\n\r\n    [227] For reference see below, p. 198, n. 2.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, before the great agrarian changes of the sixteenth\r\ncentury began, and in those parts of the country which were least\r\naffected by them, the economic environment was in other respects\r\nfavourable to the class of which we have been speaking. As far as\r\ncorn-growing is concerned, _petite culture_ flourishes most readily when\r\nthe methods of production are primitive and trade little developed. It\r\nis not necessary to point out that, in the sphere of production, the\r\nconditions which have given its present tremendous advantage to\r\nlarge-scale corn-growing are the fruit of the last century, and that in\r\nour period there were neither machinery nor expensive manures to require\r\nthe outlay of large capital, and to make arable farming almost a branch\r\nof factory industry. Moreover, there is reason to believe that the\r\ngrowth of prosperity among the peasants had been accompanied by an\r\nimprovement in the technique of cultivation. Not to mention the part\r\nwhich they took in enclosures, of which we shall speak later, there\r\nwere, at any rate by the beginning of the seventeenth century, certain\r\nexceptional parts of the country where it was said[228] that in good\r\nyears from thirty-two to eighty bushels of grain were raised to an\r\nacre, instead of the ten which Walter of Henley had thought a fair\r\nreturn in the thirteenth. We may believe this or not as we like;\r\nprobably we should discount it by at least one-half. But even the\r\naverage peasant, who could not possibly make his land perform these\r\nprodigies, was buttressed by the natural protection of unpassable roads,\r\nwhich tended to make every village, even almost every landholding\r\nfamily, more or less self-sufficing in the matter of food supplies. A\r\nhighly organised corn trade is as unfavourable to the existence of small\r\ncorn-growers as a wide market is to the small master-craftsman, because\r\nit sets a premium upon the qualities needed for business\r\nmanagement--qualities often quite different from those needed for\r\neffective farming--and thus (in the absence of co-operation) plays into\r\nthe hands of the capitalist, who buys and sells in bulk and can pick his\r\nmarket. To the mass of the peasantry in our period the commercial side\r\nof agriculture offered no problem, because for the mass of the peasantry\r\nit did not exist. The wealthier among them, it is true, did grow corn\r\nfor the market, and sent their supplies far afield through the hands of\r\nmiddlemen, much further sometimes, if we may believe contemporaries,\r\nthan Customs Officials should have allowed. In certain parts of England\r\nrudimentary industrial specialisation had made a regular corn trade a\r\nnecessity. In Norfolk,[229] for example, where manufactures and\r\nagriculture had drawn apart to an extent unknown elsewhere, a rough\r\nlocal division of labour was concentrating the woollen industry in that\r\npart of the country most suitable for grazing, and was bringing together\r\na huge population of wage-earners, who depended for their food supplies\r\non the grain produced by the \"tilth masters\" in \"the champion part of\r\nthe country,\" and whose needs baffled the traditional policy of trying\r\nto prevent corners by checking the transport of corn. But down to the\r\nvery end of the eighteenth century, and still more under the Tudors,\r\nthere was a large body of small landholders who pursued their way\r\nundisturbed by market fluctuations because they grew wheat almost\r\nentirely for subsistence. To a foreign observer[230] English agriculture\r\nin the reign of Henry VII. seemed \"not to be practised beyond what is\r\nrequired for the consumption of the people.\" Between the two extremes of\r\ncapitalist farmer and hired labourer, the poles between which the needle\r\nof the Government's policy as to prices uneasily oscillates, there\r\nstands the man whose family consumes the product of his land, and who\r\nrarely puts his small supplies on the market, because, if he tries to do\r\nso, \"he loseth[231] the labours of himself, his horse and carte, and\r\nhusbandry at home,\" and \"is in hazard to pay deare for a place to\r\nchamber it till the next market day.\" Such a man, if entirely occupied\r\nin tillage, did little more than supply the wants of his own household;\r\nif a sheep farmer as well, he worked up the wool in his own home in the\r\nmanner enjoined on thrifty housewives by Fitzherbert. From the point of\r\nview of national welfare his security was purchased by the distress in\r\nwhich the difficulty of moving corn supplies involved the wage-earner.\r\nThe constant local famines of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nshould remind us that the more self-sufficing a country's agricultural\r\neconomy, the narrower the margin there is likely to be between the\r\nlandless classes and starvation. But with them for the present we are\r\nnot concerned, and if we confine our attention to the landholding\r\npeasantry we can see that to them the backwardness of trade was a\r\npositive advantage. The risk of spoiling good farming by ineffective\r\nmarketing was not one which faced the small holders of our period.\r\n\r\n    [228] Norden, _The Surveyor's Dialogue_. He is speaking of parts\r\n    of Somersetshire. \"Now I say if this sweet country of Tandeane\r\n    and the western part of Somersetshire be not degenerated,\r\n    surely, as their land is fruitful by nature, so doe they their\r\n    best by art and industrie ... they take extraordinary pains in\r\n    soyling, plowing, and dressing their land.... After the plough\r\n    there goeth some 3 or 4 with mattocks to break the clods ...\r\n    they have sometimes and in some places foure, five, six, eight,\r\n    yea tenne quarters in an ordinary acre.\" For Walter of Henley's\r\n    figures see Maitland, _Domesday Book and Beyond_, pp. 437-438.\r\n    Gregory King at the end of the seventeenth century estimated the\r\n    average yield \"in a year of moderate plenty\" at a little more\r\n    than 11 bushels (Rogers, _History of Agriculture and Prices_,\r\n    vol. v. pp. 92 and 783). I quote Norden not as giving what was\r\n    general, but to show what it was thought could be done.\r\n\r\n    [229] _Original Papers of the Norfolk and Norwich Archæological\r\n    Society_, 1907.\r\n\r\n    [230] Camden Society, 1857, _An Italian Narration of England_.\r\n\r\n    [231] _Original Papers of the Norfolk and Norwich Archæological\r\n    Society_, 1907.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in estimating the causes which in the fifteenth century\r\nfavoured a growth in their prosperity, we should not overlook that it\r\nwas a period in which commercial policy encouraged the corn-grower. In\r\nthe series of compromises which were struck between the interests of the\r\nfarmer and those of the consumer the scale during the greater part of\r\nit was tilted in the direction of the former, and when success had\r\ncaused his holding to grow to a size which made trade in grain\r\ninevitable, he dealt in a market which the Government tried to turn in\r\nhis favour. That section of the industry which supplied the market\r\nobviously gained by freedom of export and by import duties upon foreign\r\nwheat, though the fact that England was largely a corn exporting country\r\nmade the latter less important than the former. From 1437 to 1491 free\r\nexport of wheat was permitted, subject to the obligation to obtain an\r\nexport licence when prices in the home market rose above a certain\r\npoint. In 1463 the same policy was carried furthur, and an Act was\r\npassed restricting its importation. Such a commercial[232] policy was no\r\ndoubt adopted mainly in the interests of the great landed proprietors.\r\nBut that the prosperity of the small cultivators was to some extent\r\nbound up with the Government's encouragement of corn-growing can hardly\r\nbe doubted. Competent observers in the sixteenth century gave its\r\nabandonment by the Tudors as one cause of the subsequent decline in the\r\ncondition of the peasantry, and a return to it as one remedy for their\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n    [232] See below, p. 197.\r\n\r\nIf the peasantry were favoured in the fifteenth century by a state of\r\nthings in which the small corn-grower's position was still unshaken, did\r\nthey not also gain by the beginnings of industrial expansion and by the\r\npasture farming that accompanied it? That a man who was mainly dependent\r\nupon tillage might also be a grazier upon a considerable scale, is shown\r\nby the following table of the animals kept by the customary tenants on\r\nsix[233] manors in the south of England.\r\n\r\n       I.

Bks._, 182, fol. 1,\r\n    Rental of the late Priory of Launde (Leicestershire, 1539),\r\n    where there are tenants paying for common pasture for about 430\r\n    sheep.\r\n\r\nOne must not, of course, forget that a certain number of beasts were\r\nindispensable to arable farming. Perhaps one-third or one-half the\r\ncattle in column IV. should be written off as simply part of the\r\ncorn-grower's necessary equipment. The sixteenth century small holder,\r\nwho keeps plough beasts, is no more a grazier on that account than his\r\ntwentieth century successor, who uses his grain for fodder, is a\r\ncorn-grower. But, when this has been remembered, we may perhaps allow\r\nthese figures to remind us that in the agriculture even of the small man\r\nthere was room for considerable diversity, and that in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries it was probably much more diversified than it had\r\nbeen two centuries before. So much is said in the writings of our period\r\nof the harm done by the great grazier, that we perhaps do not always\r\nsufficiently realise that the customary tenants both then and long\r\nbefore were often themselves graziers on a considerable scale. They\r\nraise stock, and are interested in the woollen trade as well as in the\r\ncorn-growing. Ultimately, when time enough had elapsed for the\r\nprofitableness of sheep farming to supply lords of manors with a motive\r\nfor clearing away interests which interfered with the formation of sheep\r\nruns, the movement for laying down land to pasture did result in\r\nevictions and rack-renting. But, looking at the fifteenth century as a\r\nwhole, may we not say with some confidence that the growth of the\r\nwoollen industry must have brought increasing prosperity to many\r\nvillages? Though it is not till almost the last decade that complaints\r\nof enclosing become sufficiently clamorous to attract the attention of\r\nthe Government, the spread of woollen manufacturers into rural districts\r\nwas going quietly on throughout the whole century, and benefited the\r\npeasants both by the lucrative bye-employment which they offered to both\r\nsexes, and by the alternative to arable farming which the demand for\r\nwool supplied in the shape of sheep-grazing. The large number of sheep\r\nkept by the customary tenants of many manors in the south of England,\r\nand the increase in the complaints as to the over-stocking of commons\r\ncontained in the Court Rolls of the fifteenth century, show that they\r\nwere not slow to seize the opportunity, and that the great pasture\r\nfarms, which aroused the indignation of More and Latimer, had their\r\nprecedent in the small flocks of thirty or forty sheep which had long\r\nbeen run by the peasantry upon the common wastes or pastures. It would\r\nseem that, as so often happens, the new departure was first made on a\r\nsmall scale by small men, and chat it was not until some time had\r\nelapsed that its wholesale adoption by large capitalists plunged them in\r\ndistress. The movement towards pasture-farming as a special branch of\r\nagriculture is one that proceeds gradually for a hundred years, before\r\nthe demand for wool becomes sufficient to produce the body of capitalist\r\ngraziers whose interests come into sharp collision with those of the\r\npeasantry.\r\n\r\nBut after all, the profits arising from favourable economic\r\ncircumstances may be of very little advantage to the mass of\r\ncultivators. They may simply be handed on to the landlord in the shape\r\nof increased rents. At a time when, both in Ireland and Scotland, rents\r\nare being fixed by public tribunals, we are not likely to forget that\r\nthe profitableness of agriculture has no necessary connection with the\r\nprosperity of tenants. Trade may be increasing, and the return from the\r\nland may be growing, and yet those things may profit the farmers and\r\npeasants very little, unless they have some security that they will not\r\nsee them drained away in increased payments for their land. It is\r\nimportant, therefore, to consider how far rents were competitive and how\r\nfar they were customary, how far the tenants held the surplus due to\r\neconomic progress, and how far it passed to the landlord.\r\n\r\nSome light is thrown on the general situation by the following\r\ntable[234]:--\r\n\r\nTABLE VI\r\n\r\n  +---------------------+-------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |   Manor.            |                Rents.                           |\r\n  +--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                    |                                                  |\r\n  |                    |   1295-1308                            1568      |\r\n  |1.

For at the earlier dates there\r\nwere works the value of which usually does not appear among the money\r\nrents. As time went on, more land was brought under cultivation and the\r\ndemesne was leased; and though an attempt has been made to exclude the\r\nlatter factor, it is not always possible to do so with certainty. The\r\nlater figures, therefore, are, if anything, a more exhaustive account of\r\nthe tenants' burdens than the earlier, and the small difference which\r\nexists between them on several manors is for this reason all the more\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nThese figures, it will be said, if they prove anything, prove too much.\r\nDo we not know that one of the grievances of the peasantry in the\r\nsixteenth century was the rack-renting of their holdings? Have we not\r\nthe evidence of Fitzherbert, Latimer, and Hales to prove it? To these\r\nquestions one must answer that it is certainly true that lords of manors\r\ndid make a strenuous effort to get from their tenants increased payments\r\nfor their holdings, and that the success which in many cases they\r\nachieved was one great cause of the decline in the condition of the\r\npeasantry. The matter, however, is not so simple as it appears. In\r\nrespect of their liability to be competitively rented, some parts of the\r\nlands of a manor stood on a different footing from others; and again,\r\nfixed rents of customary lands were quite compatible with movable fines.\r\nAn attempt will be made in subsequent chapters[235] to illustrate both\r\nthe rack-renting of those parts of a manor where the rent was least\r\ncontrolled by custom, and the upward movement of the fines charged on\r\nthe admission of tenants to their holdings. These figures of stationary\r\nor almost stationary rents must not, therefore, be taken as giving a\r\nfull account of the relations between the customary tenants and the\r\nmanorial authorities, as though there was no other way in which the\r\nlatter could compensate themselves. Subject to this qualification,\r\nhowever, they do indicate that, at any rate on the customary holdings\r\nwhich formed the kernel of the manor, there is for a very long period\r\nlittle rack-renting. They suggest that the tenants' payments have a\r\nfixity which would make Arthur Young tear his hair. They fall in line\r\nwith the statements of authorities like Fitzherbert and Norden as to the\r\ndifficulty experienced by the manorial officials in forcing up rents of\r\nassize, that \"are as in the beginning, neither risen nor fallen, but doe\r\ncontinue always one and the same.\" And this fixity of rents is a factor\r\nin the prosperity of the peasantry which can hardly be over-estimated.\r\nWhen not neutralised by exorbitant fines, it means that any surplus\r\narising on the customary tenements as the result of growing trade, or of\r\nthe fall in the value of money, or of improved methods of agriculture,\r\nanything in fact which is in the nature of economic rent, is retained by\r\nthe tenants. Secured by the custom of the manor, as by a dyke, against\r\nthe competitive pressure which under modern conditions transfers so much\r\nof the fruits of progress into the hands of the owners of land and\r\ncapital, they enjoy an unearned increment which grows with every growth\r\nin economic prosperity, and have an interest in their holdings almost\r\nsimilar to that of a landlord who is burdened only with a fixed\r\nrent-charge like the English land tax. One of the best established\r\ngeneralisations of economics, ground into the English people by thirty\r\nyears of misery, is that the effect of agrarian protection is to make a\r\npresent to landlords. But agrarian protection itself wears a different\r\ncomplexion when the rise in rents which it produces is not transferred\r\nto a small and wealthy class of absentee owners, but retained by\r\nthousands of men who are themselves cultivating the soil.\r\n\r\n    [235] See below, pp. 139-147 and 304-310.\r\n\r\nLest such a picture should seem to be drawn too much in the spirit of\r\nthe economic theorist, let us make its meaning more precise by pointing\r\nout that the retention of the unearned increment by copyhold tenants was\r\na fact of which the manorial authorities were perfectly well aware, and\r\nthe results of which they were sometimes at pains to estimate\r\narithmetically by setting side by side with the actual rent paid the\r\nrent which the holdings would fetch if put up to competition. Four\r\nexamples may be given. At Amble,[236] in 1608, the surveyor gives the\r\nrent of the customary tenants as £16, 0s. 5d., and \"the annual value\r\nbeyond rent\" as £93, 4s. 4d. On the great manor of Hexham[237] in the\r\nsame year the rents of the 314 copyhold tenants amounted to £126, 4s.\r\n8-1/4d.; the \"value above the oulde Rentes\" was £624, 4s. 1d. In the\r\nvarious townships of the manor of Rochdale[238] part of the land was\r\nrack-rented. But a great deal of it was held at payments which left the\r\ntenant a substantial margin between the rent which he paid to the king\r\nand the letting value of the land, a margin which varied from 2d. an\r\nacre in parts of Wardleworth, to 6d. an acre in parts of Wardle, 8d. an\r\nacre in Walsden, and 10d. an acre in Castleton. On the manor of\r\nBarkby[239] in Leicestershire the difference was still more striking.\r\nThe rents paid by free and customary tenants together amounted in 1636\r\nto £11, 8s. 7-1/2d.; the value of their holdings was put by the\r\nsurveyor at £215, 1s. 6d. And, of course, the fact that these rentals\r\ncome from the very end of the sixteenth, and the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth, centuries, makes the evidence which they offer of the\r\ninability of manorial authorities to insist on copyhold rents keeping\r\npace with the rising value of land, when they had every motive to\r\nenforce such correspondence if they could, all the more significant. For\r\na century they have been screwing up rents wherever they can, and here\r\nare tenants, who, as far as rents go, put 6d. in their own pockets for\r\nevery 1d. they give to the landlord. Let us repeat that these figures,\r\nstriking as they are, would, if taken by themselves, give a misleading\r\nimpression of the position of the copyhold tenants. Even when the lord\r\nof a manor cannot break the barrier opposed by manorial custom to a rise\r\nin rents, he may be able to dip his fingers in the surplus by raising\r\nthe fines charged on admission; he may be all the more exacting in\r\nscrewing the last penny out of those holdings where the rent is not\r\nfixed by custom. But though we must not forget the other side of the\r\nshield, though the very fixity of rents on many manors should make us\r\nscrutinise other conditions very carefully, we must not forget either\r\nthat a tenant whose rent is unaltered for 200 or 250 years, a tenant\r\nwho, after a period of sweeping agrarian changes in which a bitter cry\r\nhas gone up against the exactions of landlords, is paying a fifth, or a\r\nsixth, or even an eighteenth of what could be got for his holding in the\r\nopen market, is a tenant whom most modern English farmers would envy.\r\nWhatever his other disadvantages he has at any rate one condition of\r\nprosperity. He will not be eaten up by rack-renting. No wonder that such\r\na man can accumulate capital and buy up land to add to his holding. No\r\nwonder that he can sublet parts of it at a profit. No wonder that in the\r\nday of agrarian oppression the wealthier peasantry stands stubbornly\r\nagainst it, that they can carry cases from one court to another, and\r\nthat there are manors where they boast that \"20[240] of them would\r\nspend 20 score pounds\" in fighting an unpopular landlord. On the whole,\r\nthe individual cases of enterprise and prosperity among the customary\r\ntenants of the fifteenth century do fit into the view that the economic\r\nenvironment was favourable to the peasantry. They may be regarded as\r\nsymptoms, not exceptions.\r\n\r\n    [236] _Northumberland County History_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n    [237] _Ibid._, vol. iii. pp. 86?-94. On this manor at the time\r\n    of the survey, though the distinction between the old rent and\r\n    the \"cleare yearly value above the old rent\" was noted, the\r\n    latter seems to have been tapped by a rise in rents (\"cleere\r\n    improved rent above the ould rent\").\r\n\r\n    [238] _Rochdale Manor Inquisition_, 1610, by H.

Review_, vol. ix.: The History of a\r\n    Cambridgeshire Manor.\r\n\r\n    [240] Quoted, Leadam, \"The Security of Copyholders in the\r\n    Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries\" (_English Historical Review_,\r\n    vol. viii. pp. 684-?696). The case in question was that of the\r\n    inhabitants of Thingden _v._ John Mulsho.\r\n\r\nHere, perhaps, we should stop. What manner of men these were in that\r\npersonal life of which economics is but the squalid scaffolding; what\r\nstars threw for them their beams on that tremendous whirlpool of\r\nreligion and politics into which Europe was plunging, we cannot say. Of\r\nthe hopes and fears and aspirations of the men who tilled the fields\r\nwhich still give us in due season their kindly fruit, we know hardly\r\nmore than of the Roman plebs, far less than of the democracy of Athens.\r\nYet these men too had their visions. Their silence is the taciturnity of\r\nmen, not the speechlessness of dumb beasts.\r\n\r\nThat the peasantry as a class were no politicians was a natural\r\nconsequence of the position which they had occupied throughout the\r\nMiddle Ages. On a small number among them, in the Eastern counties a\r\nlarge number, the State had for centuries showered duties and\r\nobligations with a lavish hand, and the freeholders, though they must\r\noften have cursed the tediousness of suit of court, and jury service,\r\nand Parliamentary elections, turned that tiresome discipline to good\r\naccount in the days when the Stuarts had contrived to make politics to\r\nthousands of heavy-handed obstinate people throughout England a matter\r\nnot only of money but of conscience. The non-participation of the bulk\r\nof the peasantry in the same large interests was not due to poverty, for\r\noften the copyholders were wealthier than the freeholders who listened\r\nto Pym and Hampden on that first great election campaign in 1640, and\r\nleft their farms to fight for King or Parliament. Nor was it due to\r\ntimidity or lack of spirit, for, as we shall see later, they frequently\r\nasserted themselves in the course of the sixteenth century in their own\r\ncharacteristic way of agrarian strikes.[241] It was rather that the\r\ncentre of their interests and their social horizon were different. The\r\nfreeholders from an early date had been brought into contact with the\r\nchief institutions of the organised political state. Since the twelfth\r\ncentury they had been protected in their holdings by the courts, and had\r\nlearned through that cunning procedure which was the fruit of Henry\r\nII.'s[242] sleepless nights, that though often one cannot do much with\r\nthe law, one can do even less without it. Since the thirteenth century\r\nthey, along with their social superiors, had returned members to\r\nParliament, and had acquired that facility in grumbling at taxation\r\nwhich is the beginning, though not, as is so commonly supposed, the end,\r\nof political wisdom. Thus they became a body in whose eyes the Law,\r\nParliament, the State, loomed up, though for ages dimly enough, as a big\r\nsomething which it is well to have on your side, something which\r\nrequires, like the new fangled arquebuses, to be carefully handled,\r\nsomething which, if neglected, may give you a surprising shock, but if\r\ntreated with proper respect may teach manners even to your landlord. Of\r\ncourse your first duty is to him. You ride and fight for him readily\r\nenough as your fathers did. But still, you do it because you have said\r\nyou will, not because he has said you shall, and though London lawyers\r\nare a pack of knaves, it is good to know that the law will, if\r\nnecessary, make him see the difference.\r\n\r\n    [241] See below, pp. 329-331.\r\n\r\n    [242] Bracton, f. 164 b.: \"Succuritur ei per recognitionem\r\n    Assisæ novæ dissesinæ multis vigiliis excogitatam et inventam\"\r\n    (quoted Pollock and Maitland, _History of English Law_, vol. i.\r\n    p. 125 n.).\r\n\r\nBut the freeholders have been for centuries a privileged class, and\r\nthose of the peasants who are copyholders, a far more numerous body, are\r\nin a very different position. Your fathers were villeins, who hung on\r\nthe words of the upstart manorial officials, who \"had no right to know\r\nat night what they should do on the morrow,\"[243] who never had the\r\nbitter satisfaction of grumbling that they got no return for the wages\r\npaid to the knights of the shire, who had no redress from the King's\r\nCourts if threatened with eviction. Of course you are not in the same\r\nposition now. Your blood has been purged of the servile taint for\r\ngenerations. The lawyers have been competing for your business, and so\r\nthe Court of Chancery has invented a new procedure to protect you in\r\nyour holding. \"When thieves fall out....\" Still, it is better to run no\r\nrisk of offending your superiors, for the law is a chancy thing, and\r\nyour title (you keep the copy under lock and key and refuse to show it\r\nto the new surveyor lest he should twist it into meaning what it\r\ndoesn't) is none too clear.[244] Deep down in your mind, beneath the\r\nprosperity of to-day, there are dim memories of old, unhappy, far-off\r\nthings, and your shoulders slouch at their recollection. _Weh dir dass\r\ndu ein Enkel bist!_ The bailiff has invented a pedigree as long as your\r\narm to prove that your great-grandfather was a villein, and had no\r\nbusiness to have bought his freedom for the preposterous reason that the\r\nmoney with which he bought it was the lord's all along. The toadying\r\nbeast is even trying to curry favour by saying that your copyhold is for\r\nlife only, and that your fine is uncertain. True, there are plenty of\r\nancient inhabitants who will swear in the manor court that your family\r\nhas lived in the village before the present lord was ever heard of. But\r\nit is easy to bully and cajole them into silence. Were not Walter and\r\nHugh turned adrift, \"weeping bitterly,\" because money had to be found to\r\npay the young lord's debts? As a copyholder, then, you are much less\r\nconscious of the State than if you are a freeholder, because in the\r\nmatter which interests you most, the security of your holding, you have\r\nfor centuries had no dealings with the State at all. Your idea of\r\nGovernment is a vague reverence for a King who sits far away in\r\nWestminster with a crown on his head and his judges about him, and who\r\ngoverns his kingdom as a good lord--not like yours--governs his manor.\r\nFor the rest you are a non-political animal, who take little interest in\r\naffairs of State, because in the past the State has taken so little\r\ninterest in you. When your fathers made London tremble in the great days\r\nof 1381 (you can see from your hay-stack the hill where they were\r\nhanged, hanged \"like dogs\"[245]) what they demanded was fair rents and\r\nfreedom from villein services. When you went out with Ket in 1549 you\r\nasked the same, and, untaught by their experience, you begged that the\r\nKing would see that you had the fair play which his Justices of the\r\nPeace, who are your landlords, will never allow you.[246] When King and\r\nParliament come to blows, you curse both impartially, remain neutral as\r\nlong as you can, and only turn out when they begin driving the village\r\nbeasts. Your sentiments are pithily expressed in the motto which a local\r\nwit has devised for the village banner: \"If you take our cattle, we will\r\ngive you battle.\"[247]\r\n\r\n    [243] Bracton, Lib. iv. cap. 28, f. 208.\r\n\r\n    [244] _Northumberland County History_, vol. iii., Pt.

It is because the\r\nframework of their lives has for ages been different from that of the\r\nfreeholders, because the centre round which their social interests\r\nrevolve is even more localised than it is to the freeholders, because\r\nwhat matters to them most is not the law of the land but the custom of\r\nthe manor. We shall have hereafter[248] to discuss the vexed question of\r\nthe legal position occupied by the copyholders in the sixteenth century.\r\nBut we may pause for a moment to point out here the decisive part which\r\ncustom had played, and still played in our period, in moulding the lives\r\nof the mass of the peasantry, because unless this is firmly grasped we\r\ncannot understand their mental horizon. It is the custom of the manor\r\nwhich gives them their social environment and their conception of public\r\norder. The commonest name for all those who hold neither freely nor by\r\nlease is \"customary tenants,\" men whose title is rooted in custom. When\r\nthe courts begin to interfere to protect copyholders, they introduce\r\nthat sweeping innovation under the guise of enforcing customary\r\nconditions. They do not say \"copyholders can be evicted.\" Nor do they\r\nsay \"copyholders cannot be evicted.\" They say, \"Tell us what the custom\r\nof your manor is, and if it is one which does not seem to a plain man\r\ntoo unreasonable, we will enforce it.\" When tenants and landlords fall\r\nout, it is always to custom that the tenants appeal. When the peasants\r\nask the Government for assistance, they do so by demanding the\r\nobservance of their \"old customs.\"\r\n\r\n    [248] See below, pp. 287?-310.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the custom of the manor more closely. The phrase has, of\r\ncourse, misleading suggestions for modern ears. We tend to think of\r\ncustom as something indefinite and inconclusive; something which is not,\r\nlike the law (we speak of what should be), the embodiment of reason;\r\nsomething which fetters progress and is the opposite of freedom;\r\nsomething which is mere habit, and very likely a \"bad habit\" at that.\r\nAll this is true in a sense. It is the way in which in the sixteenth\r\ncentury an enterprising landlord looks at the custom which ties his\r\nhands. But it is not the way in which it is regarded by the peasants.\r\nThe custom of the manor does not mean to them a mere feeble acquiescence\r\nin existing conditions, mere inertia. It is not a negative, but a\r\npositive thing. It is no more inconsistent with progress to observe the\r\ncustom, than it is inconsistent with progress to keep out of gaol by\r\nobserving the law. For the custom is simply the law of the village. Like\r\nthe main rules of the common law, it comes down from a dim age that is\r\nbeyond the memory of man. Like law it is enforced by a court, the court\r\nof the manor. Like law it can be altered (and in some respects and on\r\nsome manors often is altered to meet the new conditions of our period)\r\nby the proper authority, which again is the court of the manor. Of\r\ncourse it is not law in the fullest sense. From one standpoint it is the\r\nantithesis of law, the law of the King's Courts, which, till the end of\r\nthe fourteenth century, has taken no cognizance of the customary\r\ntenures, though since that time the Court of Chancery, by intervening to\r\nenforce the custom of the manor in respect of copyholds, has been\r\nbreaking down the opposition. Still, for the mass of the peasantry, even\r\nin the sixteenth century, custom is a bigger, more important, thing than\r\nthe law of the national courts. It is with custom that the first\r\ndecision will lie.\r\n\r\nAgain, the custom of the manor is not at all a vague or indefinite\r\nthing. That it reposed partly on the Court Rolls, partly on the memory\r\nof ancient inhabitants, we can see from the frequent appeals which are\r\nmade to both of them. But it certainly is no mere nebulous tradition. On\r\nthe contrary, it is often most rigorous in its precision. It lays down\r\nboundaries and numbers stocks and stones. It adjusts and readjusts\r\nagricultural arrangements. It enters into the details of social life\r\nwith a bold hand. Let us reflect, to take an example, on the customs of\r\nHigh Furness, parts of which have been quoted above. Here we have a\r\nwhole village agreeing about matters which do not at first sight seem,\r\nlike the use of pastures or the fixing of boundaries, of a specially\r\npublic character. The term on which a man's property is to be\r\ndistributed among his descendants, this, if anything, one might expect\r\nto be left to his own discretion, once the succession of an heir to\r\nmaintain the rents and services due from the holding had been provided\r\nfor. The rules quoted above go much further than this. They settle\r\nexactly what proportion of a man's property is to go to his different\r\nchildren, male and female, from the eldest down to the youngest. Imagine\r\na Parish Council to-day distributing the wealth of deceased parishioners\r\nwith the object of seeing that the whole of the younger generation shall\r\nobtain some kind of start in life, and you will have an analogy to what\r\nis done by the prudent men of High Furness.\r\n\r\nOr take another example, where the points handled are of a somewhat\r\ndifferent kind. Here are the customs of the manor of Bushey,[249] as set\r\nout in 1563 by twenty customary tenants in response to an inquiry by the\r\nlord:--\r\n\r\n\"In primis to the fyrste article we saye that no copyholder at the tyme\r\nof his death dying seased of twoo copyholdes hathe paid any more than\r\none quycke heriott by the tyme of any remembrance, or before, to our\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the seconde we saye that the lorde oughtte to have the second\r\nbeste for hys herryott and the heyer the beste.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the thyrde we saye that the copyholder that doth surrender his\r\ncopyholde ought not to paye any herryott upon the surrender of his\r\ncopyholde except yt be in extreme of deathe.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the fourth we saye that lords of the mannor have never demanded\r\nnor any copyholder payde any more for their ffyne than one yere's rente\r\nof the lande.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the fyfth we saye that the widdowe upon the deathe of her\r\nhusbande shall have the thyrde parte of the rente of the lande, but not\r\nthe thyrde part of the lande except yt be surrendered to her by her\r\nhusbande.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the syxth we saye that the copyholder may sell hys underwoode\r\nand stocke upp by the roote the same wytheout lycense of the lorde.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the seventh we saye that the copyholder may fell tymber for\r\nreparacion or otherwyse to sell the same to hys use and profyt; so hathe\r\nyt byn used by our tymes and by all tyme beyond the memory of man.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the eytthe we saye that the copyholder may make a grante of hys\r\ncopyholde for three yeres wythoute the lord's lycense, and the lorde to\r\ntake nothing for the same.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the nineth we saye that the tenants maye take surrender bothe\r\nwithin the manor and without the manor.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the tenth we saye that we cannot answer for that we knowe not\r\nevery man's lande.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the eleventh we saye that every copyholde is not heryottable.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the xiith we knowe not where the Courte Rolles, Rentals, or\r\ncustomaryes of the manor are remayning or in whose custodye.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the xiiith we saye that we knowe not of any deutyes or rentys\r\nwithdrawn from the lordshippe.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the xiiiith we saye that we never knewe nor hearde any heryott\r\npayde for freeholde at the dethe of the freholder.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the fyfteneth we say that the freholder hathe never payde\r\nrelief at alienacion, but at deathe only.\r\n\r\n\"Item to the xvith we saye that a copyholder dying his heir being wythin\r\nthe age of xiiii yeres the custody of the body and lande oughte to be\r\ncomytted by the lorde to the nexte of the kyn to whom the inheritance\r\nmay not dyscende.\"\r\n\r\n     [249] I take them from the MSS. Court Rolls of the Manor of Bushey,\r\n     kindly lent me by the late Miss Lucy Toulmin Smith.\r\n\r\nIn themselves these customs are not in any way remarkable, except\r\nperhaps for the uniform favour which they show to the interests of the\r\ntenants. They might be paralleled from those of scores of other manors.\r\nWhat is worth noticing is the precision of the rules laid down. The\r\nrelations between the lord and the tenants are settled with the\r\ndefiniteness of a sort of great collective bargain.\r\n\r\nIt would be going beyond the scope of this essay to enter upon the large\r\nquestion, on which so much learning has been expended, of the respective\r\nparts played in manorial origins by the communal organisation of\r\nvillagers for the purpose of self-government in their agrarian affairs,\r\nand by the authoritative pressure of superior authorities for the\r\npurpose of using the village as the basis of a financial and political\r\nsystem. But one may point out that facts such as have been quoted above\r\nin illustration of the rule of custom cannot easily be fitted into any\r\ntheory which regards the economic arrangements of the manor as the\r\nresult simply of a system imposed from above, and which treats the\r\ncustomary rights of the peasants as the outcome of concessions made by\r\nlords from time to time in their own interests, the revocation of which\r\ninvolved no larger difficulties than necessarily surround the alteration\r\nof practices sanctioned by long use. However much the organisation of\r\nvillage life may have been stereotyped by the pressure directed upon it\r\nby the desire of the manorial authorities to extract rents and services\r\non an unvarying plan, one cannot trace it altogether to its\r\nsubordination to such external forces, because the custom of the manor\r\nacts as a restriction which impedes the free action of lords themselves\r\nand their agents, even when they are most anxious to break through its\r\nmeshes. This is seen more clearly perhaps in the sixteenth century than\r\nin earlier periods, for the very reason that the sharp collision of\r\ninterests between lords and tenants makes it more possible to\r\ndistinguish those parts of manorial custom which represent the economic\r\ninterests of the tenants, from those which represent the power of the\r\nmanorial authorities imposed upon them. Under the latter heading would\r\nfall the rules as to heriots and reliefs, rules forbidding waste, rules\r\nrequiring tenants to pay \"for the rushes which they gather on the lord's\r\ncommon,\"[250] or to perform the surviving remnants of labour services,\r\nwhile a rule such as that of High Furness, forbidding the division of\r\nholdings to such an extent as to prevent the discharge of services or\r\nthe obtaining of an adequate living by the occupier, may be regarded as\r\na compromise in which the interests of both lord and tenant receive\r\nconsideration. Under the former may be placed the custom which fixes\r\nrents, and, on some fortunate manors like Bushey, fixes fines to be paid\r\non admission, sanctions the sub-letting of copyholds and the felling of\r\ntimber, and allots rights of pasture to each arable holding. Not all of\r\nthese, of course, stand upon the same footing of importance. The right\r\nto cut wood is much less essential than the right to graze cattle. But\r\nsome of them, at any rate, like rights of common pasture, seem to be\r\nbound up with the very existence of the village as an agricultural\r\ncommunity, and all of them are dictated by the interests of the peasants\r\nin protecting themselves against encroachments, as clearly as are those\r\nof the first type by the desire of lords to make the manor a source of\r\nprofit to themselves. It is scarcely possible to account for the\r\nobstacles put by manorial customs in the way of changes which would\r\nbenefit the lord and be detrimental to the tenant, except on the\r\nsupposition that they are rooted in something more indestructible than\r\nthe mere concession of privileges which long use has solidified and\r\nhardened; something which can only be found in the fact that they are an\r\nessential part of the life of the village, to which the lord himself, as\r\na condition of extracting revenue from it, is almost bound to conform.\r\n\r\n    [250] Aldeburgh, _temp._ Henry VIII., R.O. _Misc. Bks. Treas. of\r\n    Receipts_, vol. clxiii. See Appendix I., No. II.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to our original point, the way in which the whole social\r\nenvironment of all the tenants, except the freeholders, who do not need\r\nthe protection of custom, and the leaseholders,[251] who cannot get it,\r\nis dependent upon the custom of the manor. Fraught with modern\r\nassociations as it is, the phrase \"collective[252] bargain\" is perhaps\r\nthe nearest we can get to expressing what the custom of the manor means\r\nto the peasants themselves. Of course it is much more than this. The\r\ncustom has the sanction of immemorial antiquity. The phrase \"time out of\r\nmind\" is no mere piece of idle rhetoric. The stable self-perpetuating\r\nconditions of economic life create a sort of communal memory, in which\r\ncenturies are focussed. There were villages where, in the reign of\r\nElizabeth, the effects of the Great Plague[253] were still dimly\r\nremembered. But regarding the matter from the point of view of the\r\npractical working of village life, we shall not be far wrong if we think\r\nof the peasants as a body of men who are more or less organised, and of\r\nthe custom as a system of common rules which regulates the relations\r\nbetween them and the lord. And it is evident that the custom of the\r\nmanor, at any rate in our period, is a safeguard of the tenants'\r\ninterests rather than of those of the manorial authorities. It is not\r\nonly that the changes which followed the Great Plague have set the\r\npeasants free from the most irksome customary restrictions, but,\r\nfurther, that, in the sixteenth century, it is the lord who wants to\r\nmake innovations and the tenants who resist them, and that it is\r\ntherefore the latter who stand to gain most by clinging to custom. The\r\ncustom sets up a standard by which encroachments can be opposed, by\r\nwhich the village as a whole can put a solid barrier in the way of\r\nchange, by which blacklegging (in the shape of one man taking a holding\r\nover the head of another) can be prevented. Competitive forces have, it\r\nis true, been gradually undermining custom, and by the sixteenth century\r\nan increasing number of tenants have the terms on which they take their\r\nholdings settled by the higgling of the market without reference to any\r\nauthoritative rule. Nevertheless, as far as the copyholders, who are the\r\nkernel of the manor, are concerned, competition is held in check by the\r\nfact that, on certain fundamental matters, there is a common\r\nunderstanding between the peasants, which is recognised by the lord\r\nhimself. The manorial authorities cannot bargain with the tenants one by\r\none. They have to deal with the villagers as men who are \"organised,\"\r\nwho are members of a society, who know what they have to expect in the\r\nway of heriots and rents and fines, and who will be supported by village\r\nopinion in resisting innovations. On occasion the peasants will strike.\r\nOn occasion they will force their landlord to arbitration.[254] One\r\nmight almost say that the customary tenants are trade unionists to a\r\nman. Again, who shall determine what the custom is? The court rolls will\r\nthrow light on certain points, and occasionally we find lords appealing\r\nto them successfully in order to upset the tenants' claims. But on many\r\nmatters there is no guide but tradition; the exponents of tradition are\r\nthe ancient inhabitants; the lord has to ask them to expound it, as he\r\ndoes the tenants of Bushey. Can we doubt that this was a powerful check\r\non autocratic action on his part? Lords come and go. But the custom of\r\nthe manor endures, and probably loses nothing in the telling.\r\n\r\n    [251] Some copyholders, who held land which was not \"customary\r\n    land\" but part of the demesne or the waste, were not protected\r\n    by custom either: for a discussion of this point see below, pp.\r\n    293?-294.\r\n\r\n    [252] See below for an example from Crondal, p. 295.\r\n\r\n    [253] MS. Transcript by A.N.

For agrarian strikes see below, pp.\r\n    329?-331.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we ask what the custom means to the peasantry, we must think\r\nnot of the \"forbidding, stale, and meagre ways,\" which is what the word\r\ncustom too often suggests in the twentieth century, but of the phrase\r\n\"ancient customs and liberties,\" which is so common in the charters of\r\nBoroughs. The custom of the manor is a body of rules which regulates the\r\nrights and obligations of the peasants in their daily life. It is a kind\r\nof law. It is a kind of freedom. And since it is the custom which most\r\nconcerns the mass of the peasantry, it is not the state, or the law, but\r\nthe custom of the manor which forms their political environment and from\r\nwhich they draw their political ideas. They cannot conceive the state\r\nexcept as a very great manor. Their idea of good government is the\r\nenforcement of an idealised customary.[255]\r\n\r\n    [255] See below, pp. 338?-340.\r\n\r\nHaving said this we can say little more. There is no standard by which\r\nwe can measure civilisation, and if we knew more than we do, the village\r\nlife of the sixteenth century--and England is all villages--would still\r\nbe a mystery to us. Yet, before returning to the humbler task of\r\nexamining economic conditions, we may perhaps summarise the sort of\r\nimpressions formed of the peasants by those who knew them in their own\r\nday, impressions no doubt as misleading as a traveller's sketches of\r\nmodern England, yet, like a traveller's sketches, possessing a certain\r\nvalue, because they show the points which an intelligent outside opinion\r\nselects for emphasis.\r\n\r\nOne is encouraged in one's belief in the comparative prosperity of a\r\nlarge number of the peasantry in the earlier sixteenth century by the\r\ncomments which the writers of the periods pass upon it, even after a\r\ndecline has already begun. The picture we get is of an open-handed,\r\nturbulent, large-eating and deep-drinking people, much given to\r\nhospitality and to merriment both coarse and refined; according to\r\nmodern standards very ignorant, yet capable of swift enthusiasm,\r\nlitigious, great sticklers for their rights, quick to use force in\r\ndefence of them, proud of their independence, and free from the grosser\r\nforms of poverty which crush the spirit. The latter feature strikes\r\neverybody. Foreign visitors[256] notice with amazement the outward signs\r\nof wealth among the humbler classes. English writers, though their tone\r\nbecomes sadder and sadder as the century proceeds, are never tired of\r\nboasting of it. Even in the eighties of the sixteenth century, when many\r\nof the peasants are much worse off than they had been a hundred years\r\nbefore, Harrison, though he paints in dark colours the ruinous effects\r\nof the agrarian changes, describes their hearty life with good-humoured\r\ngusto. \"Both the artificer and the husbandman are sufficiently liberal\r\nand very friendly at their tables, and when they meet they are so merry\r\nwithout malice, and plain without inward Italian or French craft and\r\nsublety, that it would do a man good to be in company among them....\r\nTheir food consisteth principally of beef and such meat as the butcher\r\nselleth. That is to say, mutton, veal, lamb, pork. In feasting also the\r\nlatter sort, I mean the husbandmen, do exceed after their manner,\r\nespecially at bridals, purifications of women, and such odd meetings,\r\nwhere it is incredible to tell what meat is consumed and spent, each one\r\nbringing such a dish, or so many with him, as his wife and he consult\r\nupon, but always with this consideration that the lesser friend shall\r\nhave the better provision.\" The peasants themselves have a good conceit\r\nof their position, and all unmindful of the whirligig of time and its\r\nrevenges, contrast it with that of their class in France, where women\r\nlabour like beasts in the fields, where men go in wooden shoes or no\r\nshoes at all, where the people drink water instead of ale, eat rye bread\r\nand little meat, and have not even the heart, like honest Englishmen, to\r\nrob the rich who oppress them, and that in the most fertile realm in all\r\nthe world;[257] \"Caytives and wretches, lyvyng in lyke thraldome as they\r\ndyd to the Romaynes, and gevynge tribute for theyr meat, drinke, brede,\r\nand salte, which for theyr wayke personayges and tymorous hartes I may\r\ncompare to the pigmies who waged battayle against the Cranes, so that I\r\ndare let slip a hundred good yeomen of England against five hundred of\r\nsuch ribaldry.\"[258] Apart from the utterances of these good Jingoes,\r\nstray glimpses show us a people which not only is materially prosperous,\r\nbut is also bold in action, and can produce men of high moral ardour. In\r\nthe twentieth century the rural population is a bye-word for its\r\ndocility. Its ancestors in the sixteenth were notorious for their\r\nrestiveness. Hales, who knew and loved them, makes one of the characters\r\nin his dialogue[259] suggest that men at arms should be used to put down\r\nthe disturbances made by them and by the unemployed weavers, only to\r\nanswer, through the lips of another, that to call in the military will\r\nbe the best way to make them riot all the more:--\"Marie, I think that\r\nwaye wold be rather occasion of commotions to be stirred than to be\r\nquenched, for the stomakes of Englishmen would never beare that, to\r\nsuffer such injuries and reproaches as I knowe suche (_i.e._ the men at\r\narms) use to do to the subjects of France.\"\r\n\r\n    [256] Harrison in _Elizabethan England_ (Withington), p. 114,\r\n    quoting one of \"the Spaniards in Queen Mary's days.\" \"These\r\n    English have their houses made of sticks and dirt, but they fare\r\n    commonly so well as the king.\"\r\n\r\n    [257] Fortescue, _On the Governance of England_, chaps. iii. and\r\n    xiii. The Scots, he thinks, are only one degree less\r\n    faint-hearted than the French. \"Thai ben often tymes hanged for\r\n    larceny, and stelynge off good in the absence off the owner\r\n    theroff. But ther hartes serve them not to take a manys gode,\r\n    while he is present, and woll defende it.\"\r\n\r\n    [258] Coke, _Debate of Heralds_. See also the quotation,\r\n    Froude's _Henry VIII._, vol. i. chap, i., from a State Paper of\r\n    1515: \"What comyn folke in all this world may compare with the\r\n    comyns of England, in riches, freedom, liberty, welfare, and all\r\n    prosperity? What comyn folke is so mighty, so stronge in the\r\n    felde, as the comyns of England?\"\r\n\r\n    [259] _The Commonweal of this Realm of England_ (Lamond), p. 94.\r\n\r\nThese humble people have their idealisms. They produce martyrs for the\r\nnew religion and for the old, Lollards who suffer persecution for\r\nupholding the Wycliffite tradition in the quiet villages of\r\nBuckinghamshire, Catholics who follow Aske in that wonderful movement of\r\nnorthern England, the last of the crusades, in 1536, or fall in\r\nDevonshire thirteen years later before the artillery of Herbert. Nor are\r\nthey altogether cut off from the springs of learning. For at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century the upper classes have not yet begun\r\nto covet education for themselves sufficiently to withhold it from the\r\npoor. Bequests[260] show that the sons of well-to-do peasants may have\r\nbeen among those godly yeomanry whom Latimer[261] described as once, in\r\nhappier social conditions than those amid which he preached,\r\nfrequenting the older universities, and the records of some sixteenth\r\ncentury grammar-schools tell a similar story. Among the first twenty-two\r\nnames on the register of Repton[262] there are five gentlemen, four\r\nhusbandmen, nine yeomen, two websters or weavers, a carpenter, and a\r\ntanner.\r\n\r\n    [260] _Victoria County History_, Berkshire, ii., 208. In 1558 a\r\n    yeoman leaves his son a portion of land worth £10 a year \"for\r\n    his keepinge and learninge in Oxford for five years nexte.\" On\r\n    the same page there is a case of a man described as a \"yeoman\"\r\n    who is tenant by copy of Court Roll.\r\n\r\n    [261] Latimer's _Sermons_. The first sermon preached before King\r\n    Edward, March 8, 1549 (Everyman Series, p. 86): \"We have good\r\n    statutes made for the commonwealth, as touching commoners and\r\n    enclosures; many meetings and sessions; but in the end of the\r\n    matter there cometh nothing forth. Well, well, this is one thing\r\n    I will say unto you; from whence it cometh I know, even from the\r\n    devil. I know his intent in it. For if ye bring it to pass that\r\n    the yeomanry be not able to put their sons to school (as indeed\r\n    universities do wondrously decay already); I say ye pluck\r\n    salvation from the people and utterly destroy the realm. For by\r\n    yeomen's sons the faith of Christ is and hath been maintained\r\n    chiefly.\" See also _A Supplication of the Poor Commons_ (E. E.\r\n    T. S.): \"This thing causeth that suche possessioners as\r\n    heretofore were able and used to maintain their own children ...\r\n    to lernynge and suche other qualities as are necessary to be had\r\n    in this Your Highness Royalme, are now of necessitie compelled\r\n    to set theyr own children to labour, and al is lytle enough to\r\n    pay the lorde's rent, and to take the house anew at the end of\r\n    the yere.\" The children of yeomen had no doubt been educated\r\n    mainly for the Church, and some attained high position (_Surtees\r\n    Society_, vol. lxxix. pp. 263-?264, for the son of a yeoman\r\n    becoming a Bishop, and vol. li. No. 53, the son of a yeoman\r\n    becoming subdeacon of York, vol. lxxix. pp. 176?-177, for a\r\n    yeoman's son sent to school for fifteen years). But in the\r\n    fifteenth century this was not always so, v. Leach, _Educational\r\n    Charters_, p. 41, for a school founded in Yorkshire, a county\r\n    which \"produced many youths endowed with light and sharpness of\r\n    ability, who do not all want to attain the dignity and elevation\r\n    of the priesthood, that these may be better fitted for the\r\n    mechanical arts and other concerns of this world.\" A case of\r\n    hostility to the education of the poorer classes based on the\r\n    idea that education should be reserved for \"gentlemen\" is given\r\n    _ibid._ p. 470, where the notorious Lord Rich and other\r\n    gentlemen argue \"as for husbandsmen's children, they were more\r\n    meet ... for the plough and to be artificers than to occupy the\r\n    place of the learned sort. So that they wished none else to be\r\n    put to school, but only gentlemen's children.\" Cranmer retorted,\r\n    \"Poor men's children ... are commonly more apt to apply their\r\n    study than is the gentleman's son delicately educated ... the\r\n    poor man's son by painstaking will be learned, when the\r\n    gentleman's son will not take the pains to get it, ... wherefore\r\n    if the gentleman's son be apt to learning let him be admitted;\r\n    if not apt, let the poor man's child being apt enter in his\r\n    room.\"\r\n\r\n    [262] _Repton School Register_, 1564-?1910. One of the\r\n    husbandmen kept his boy at school for ten years. The average\r\n    school life of the sons of seven yeomen was between six and\r\n    seven years; one stays for twelve years, going to school at five\r\n    and staying till seventeen. If one may judge by the attitude of\r\n    most modern parents (\"I went to the mill when I was ten, and why\r\n    shouldn't Tommie?\"), these men must have been pretty comfortably\r\n    off.\r\n\r\nBut by that time much had changed, and for seventy years before these\r\ndocuments begin the peasantry in many parts of England had had sterner\r\nthings to think of than the schooling of their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PEASANTRY (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n(e) _Signs of Change_\r\n\r\nSo far attention has been concentrated upon those phenomena which\r\nsuggest that, before the great agrarian changes of the sixteenth century\r\nbegin, there has been a period--one may date it roughly from 1381 to\r\n1489--of increasing prosperity for the small cultivator. We have\r\nemphasised the evidence of this upward movement which is given by the\r\ngrowth among the peasantry of a freer and more elastic economy. We have\r\nwatched them shake off many of the restrictions imposed by villeinage\r\nand build up considerable properties. We have seen how the custom of the\r\nmanor still acts as a dyke to defend them against encroachments, and to\r\nconcentrate in their hands a large part of the fruits of economic\r\nprogress. In the century from the Peasants' Revolt to the first Statute\r\nagainst Depopulation, in spite of the political anarchy which disfigures\r\nit, there is, as it seems to us an interval between one oppressive\r\nrégime and another, between the leaden weight of villeinage and the\r\nstress and strain of the gathering power of competition. In that happy\r\nbalance between the forces of custom and the forces of economic\r\nenterprise, custom is powerful, yet not so powerful that men cannot\r\nevade it when evasion is desired; enterprise is growing, yet it has not\r\ngrown to such lengths as to undermine the security which the small man\r\nfinds in the established relationships and immemorial routine of\r\ncommunal agriculture.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, we need hardly say, another side to the picture, and\r\nto that other side we must now turn. We must examine again from another\r\npoint of view some of the ground over which we have already travelled,\r\nand we must modify the opinions which we have formed by bringing a fresh\r\nrange of facts into perspective. The piecemeal changes which have been\r\ngoing on in the internal organisation of so many manors look forward as\r\nwell as back, and are of significance as throwing light on the larger\r\ninnovations of the later period. For one thing, they mean the appearance\r\namong the customary tenantry of persons who are in a small way\r\ncapitalists, and who supply a link between the great farmer of the\r\nsixteenth century and the agricultural organisation of earlier periods.\r\nThe emergence out of the mediæval peasantry of prosperous cultivators,\r\noccupying two or three times as much land as their grandfathers, is a\r\nproof that holdings of a considerable size can be managed successfully,\r\nand the farmers of the demesne are often drawn from among them. For\r\nanother thing, the inequality which has appeared among the holdings of\r\ndifferent tenants implies the growth of a state of things in which\r\ninnovations in the customary methods of agriculture are much more likely\r\nto be made than they were when all the tenants were organised in fairly\r\nwell-defined classes. The smaller among them are still practising\r\nsubsistence farming when the larger are producing on a considerable\r\nscale for the market, are acquiring capital, are extending their\r\nholdings, are even becoming landlords themselves. There arises therefore\r\na divergence of agricultural methods and economic interests between\r\nthem, which is quite compatible with the fact that both large and small\r\ntenants stand in the same legal relationship to the lord of whom they\r\nhold. The enterprise which the former show in their dealings with land\r\nand in encroaching on the routine of manorial cultivation cannot fail to\r\nhave a powerful influence in preparing the way for the individualistic\r\nmovement which sweeps over agriculture in the sixteenth century, and\r\nfrom which the peasants, as a class, suffer so severely. The freedom\r\nwith which parcels of land change hands must inevitably weaken the\r\nconnection between the family and the holding, and result in leaving the\r\nleast successful without any land at all. The difficulty of maintaining\r\na peasant proprietary without restricting the alienation of land is one\r\nwhich is familiar to modern Governments, and there is clear\r\nevidence[263] that, even before the evictions of the sixteenth century\r\nbegan to attract attention, a decline in the number of customary tenants\r\nwas brought about on a good many manors by the mere process of the\r\nwell-to-do buying up the poorer men's holdings.\r\n\r\n    [263] I am inclined to think that an investigation of the\r\n    manorial records of the fifteenth century would show a\r\n    considerable decrease in the number of customary tenants, not as\r\n    a result of evictions, but simply as a consequence of one man\r\n    buying out another and forming one larger holding out of two or\r\n    more smaller ones. The evidence for this is as follows: (1) When\r\n    several holdings pass to one man there must be a diminution\r\n    unless more land is brought under cultivation. Such an\r\n    agglomeration of holdings has been shown to be very frequent.\r\n    (2) A comparison of fifteenth and sixteenth century surveys with\r\n    those of an earlier date shows a marked diminution in the number\r\n    of customary tenants (a) before complaints as to enclosure\r\n    become loud, and on manors where there is no trace of enclosing\r\n    by lords or large farmers; (b) on manors where more land is\r\n    cultivated by the customary tenants than at an earlier date.\r\n    Thus at Haversham there were 52 tenants of all kinds in 1305, 35\r\n    in 1458, 14 in 1497 (_Victoria County History_, Gloucestershire,\r\n    vol. ii. pp. 61?-62). On six Northumbrian manors, where there is\r\n    no sign of evictions on a large scale, there were 82 customary\r\n    tenants in 1294, and 37 in 1567, and where intermediate surveys\r\n    enable one to narrow the limiting points, one finds that there\r\n    has been a considerable diminution before the end of the\r\n    fifteenth century. On the four tithings, of South Newton,\r\n    Childhampton, Stovord, and Little Wishford, which made up the\r\n    manor of South Newton, customary tenants numbered at the\r\n    beginning of the fourteenth century 32, 7, 13, 13, and in 1567\r\n    10, 3, 7, 1, the average holding having grown from 10-1/2 to\r\n    about 43 acres (Roxburghe Club, _Pembroke Surveys_). At Sutton\r\n    Warblington there were in 1351, 28 customary tenants, and in\r\n    1568 there were 7, while the average acreage of each tenant's\r\n    holding had increased enormously (_Crondal Records_, Baigent).\r\n    At Dippenhall and Swanthrop, two tithings of the manor of\r\n    Crondal, the customary tenants numbered 40 in 1287, 24 in 1568,\r\n    while the average size of their holdings had risen from between\r\n    18 and 19 to just under 35 acres. At Aldershot the number of\r\n    customary tenants during the same period fell from 48 to 37\r\n    (_ibid._). Such figures are of course full of pitfalls. In the\r\n    North border warfare reduced the population, and the effects of\r\n    the Great Plague have to be considered. The great growth in the\r\n    size of holdings does, however, suggest that a diminution in the\r\n    number of customary tenants may have occurred without any\r\n    encroachments being made by lords on the customary land, and\r\n    merely through one tenant buying up the land of another.\r\n\r\nSuch movements prepare the way for greater changes: petty capitalism is\r\nnaturally followed by capitalism on a larger scale. It is surely at\r\nfirst sight somewhat surprising that the noticeable upward movement in\r\nthe condition of the rural population, which coincides with the\r\ndisappearance of villeinage and the growth of copyhold tenure, should\r\nhave been followed by the marked depression which all observers agree to\r\nhave occurred in the following century. Why should a class which has\r\ndisplayed such remarkable signs of vigour and enterprise find such\r\ndifficulty in holding its own? An answer to this question cannot be\r\ngiven till after a consideration of the new causes at work in the\r\nsixteenth century. But may it not be that their position had to some\r\nextent been undermined by the very changes which at first improved it,\r\nand that the enterprise of the larger customary tenants, while it added\r\nto their prosperity as long as they led the way in it, tended to weaken\r\nthe customary relations and the customary methods of agriculture which\r\nhad protected the small man, and to leave him at the mercy of\r\ncompetitive forces which he could not control? Such an undulating line\r\nof development, in which the small producer gains temporarily from the\r\nexpansion of markets and improved technical methods which ultimately rob\r\nhim of his independence, can be paralleled from the later history both\r\nof agriculture[264] and of manufacturing industry. It seems to us to\r\noffer a thread which connects the capitalist farmer of the sixteenth\r\ncentury with the prosperous peasantry of the fifteenth. When there is\r\nmuch buying and selling of land among the peasantry, much colonising of\r\nnew plots taken from the waste and the demesne, we should expect to see\r\nthe influence of competition beginning to override that of custom; we\r\nshould expect to see the paring away of communal restrictions to make\r\nroom for individual arrangements of a more elastic nature. In the\r\nremainder of this chapter we shall approach this problem by considering\r\ntwo movements--the growth at an early date of competitive rents on those\r\nparts of manors where custom was weakest, and the enclosing of land by\r\ncustomary tenants themselves. The former offers a precedent for the\r\nrack-rents and excessive fines of which so much is heard in the\r\nsixteenth century, the latter at once an analogy and a contrast with the\r\nenclosures carried out by lords of manors and capitalist farmers, which\r\nwe shall discuss in Part II.\r\n\r\n    [264] Thus the yeomen seem to have increased in prosperity at\r\n    the end of the eighteenth and in the early nineteenth century\r\n    (though at the same time large classes of agrarian workers were\r\n    suffering terribly), because the rise in prices made\r\n    corn-growing a gold-mine. The collapse came probably after 1815\r\n    (see Johnson, _The Disappearance of the Small Landowner_, chap.\r\n    vii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n(f) _The Growth of Competitive Rents on New Allotments_\r\n\r\nThe development of competitive rents is a subject which must always\r\npossess a peculiar fascination for the historical economist, inasmuch\r\nas the distribution of wealth depends to no small degree upon the manner\r\nin which the surplus gains wrung from nature are shared between\r\ndifferent classes. The wealth which, under a régime of great estates and\r\nleasehold tenure, accrues to a tiny body of landlords, is, in a\r\ncommunity of small freeholders, retained by the cultivating tenant, and,\r\nwhen the tenure of land is such that custom sets a barrier to a rise in\r\nrents, is divided between owner and occupier in a way which prevents the\r\nformer from absorbing the whole advantage of superior sites, or the\r\nlatter from being reduced to working for bare wages of management. The\r\ncauses which determine the allocation of rents must always be of crucial\r\nimportance for an understanding of economic conditions, and any change\r\nwhich augments them, diminishes them, or varies the degree to which\r\ndifferent classes participate in them, is likely in time to produce a\r\nsubstantial alteration both in the economic configuration of society and\r\nin the possession of social privileges and political power. In modern\r\ntimes, it is true, the enormous area from which food-stuffs are drawn,\r\nand the relatively small space upon which manufacturing industry can be\r\nconcentrated, has made the differential payments accruing to the\r\nlandowner from varieties of soil and situation almost trifling compared\r\nwith the surpluses drawn from finance and manufacturing industry by the\r\ninfra-marginal capitalist and entrepreneur. Such \"quasi-rents\" are,\r\nhowever, a comparatively modern phenomenon. In our period the basis of\r\nwealth was land, and a crucial question is that of the manner in which\r\nincomes drawn from land were determined. We have seen that in the\r\nsixteenth century custom still ruled the payments made by most of the\r\ncopyhold tenants. But at that time there were many complaints of\r\nrack-renting, and though we must leave till later an inquiry into their\r\njustification, it will help us if we take a glance at the new forces,\r\nwhich, even in the Middle Ages, were beginning to operate on the margin\r\nof cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe gradual extension of cultivation over the waste lands surrounding\r\nthe village fields, and the not infrequent addition of parts of the\r\nlord's demesne to the tenants' holdings, was obviously the occasion, as\r\nit took place, of a number of new agreements between the payer and\r\nreceiver of rents, which might or might not repeat the conditions of\r\nexisting contracts. When new land was broken up for tillage an attempt\r\nseems in some cases to have been made by the manorial authorities to\r\nassimilate its treatment, as far as payment was concerned, to that of\r\nthe existing customary holdings. The basis of the rent paid was a\r\ncomparison between the areas of the encroachments and the ordinary\r\nholding of a customary tenant; the payment was so many ploughlands'[265]\r\nworth, and sometimes the corresponding services were extracted from\r\nthem. On the other hand, the mere fact that the land was new land, which\r\ndid not come into the original scheme of manorial finance and\r\norganisation, tended to make it the point from which new relationships\r\ncould spring. For one thing, it was the natural starting-point for the\r\nprocess of substituting money rents for labour. When the customary\r\nholdings offered a sufficient supply of labour for the cultivation of\r\nthe demesne, the manorial authorities naturally preferred to take the\r\npayments for additional land in the shape of money rather than in\r\nservices of which they already had sufficient. Services are sometimes\r\nexacted for the new encroachments, but they are the exception; and the\r\nassimilation of the payments for these new holdings to those made for\r\nthe customary holdings was either not seriously attempted or was\r\nunsuccessful. One can quite understand that, even if the lord wanted\r\nlabour services from those parts of the waste which were broken up and\r\nadded to the cultivated area, he might not be able to get the\r\nimprovements made on the old terms. Quite apart, therefore, from the\r\nprocess of commutation, the growth of money rents developed as a natural\r\naccompaniment of the growth of population.\r\n\r\n    [265] _Crondal Records_ (Baigent), p. 132?-133, Rental of 1287:\r\n    \"The same Hugh holds certain encroachments on payment of 3\r\n    ploughlands' worth, 3 hens, and 3d. at the said term.\" \"Emma of\r\n    Wyggeworthhall ... holds certain encroachments on payment\r\n    therefor 11s. 6d. and one ploughland's worth.\" These documents\r\n    throw much light on the whole process of the extension of\r\n    cultivation over the waste.\r\n\r\nThe second point is more important. It is that the rents paid for the\r\nnew holdings taken from the waste differed from such money payments as\r\nwere made for the customary holdings, in that they were not to the same\r\nextent dominated by custom, but were to a much greater extent influenced\r\nby competition. This contrast is the tiny seed of great changes, and may\r\nbe illustrated by an example drawn from the south of England at a\r\ncomparatively early date. At Yateleigh,[266] one of the tithings of the\r\nmanor of Crondal, the absorption of the waste by the customary tenants\r\nwent on with great rapidity even in the thirteenth century, and in the\r\nrental drawn up by the steward in 1287 we find the rents and services\r\npaid for the customary holdings and the rents paid for the encroachments\r\nset down side by side. The latter fall into a definite scheme which can\r\nbe picked out at a glance. With a very few exceptions the rent charged\r\nfor an acre of land taken from the waste is always 4d., and this is the\r\nbasis for all other payments for the varying portions of waste occupied\r\nby the tenants. A two acre piece pays 8d. For a piece of 9-1/2 acres the\r\npayment is still about 4-1/4d. per acre, the awkward sum of 3s. 4-1/2d.\r\nThe rents and services of the customary holdings, however, cannot be\r\nreduced to any such simple and uniform plan of adjusting rent to\r\nacreage. In the first place all of them, whatever their size, are liable\r\nto an initial charge of 9-1/2d., called \"Pondpany.\" In the second place\r\nthere is only the roughest correspondence between the amount of land\r\nheld by a tenant and the payment which he makes. A holding of 22 acres\r\npays 2s. 10d., but so does a holding of 32 acres, while one of 29 acres\r\npays 2s. 2d. Holdings of 12-1/2, of 16, and of 18-1/2 acres all make\r\nexactly the same payment of 2s. In short, though it would not be quite\r\ntrue to say that the payment made bears no relation to the size of the\r\nholding, the relation which it bears is not at all definite and precise.\r\nIt is a general relation applying rather to groups of holdings roughly\r\nmarked off from others by broad differences in extent, not to individual\r\nholdings. There is no standard price per acre at all, such as appears in\r\na modern land market, and such as exists for the land taken from the\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\n    [266] _Crondal Records_ (Baigent), pp. 116?-120.\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason of this remarkable contrast between the rents of\r\npieces of land lying quite near to each other and held by the same\r\ntenants, which causes the payment for one set of holdings, the\r\nencroachments, to be adjusted uniformly to the area held, and the other,\r\nthe customary holdings, to be rented apparently without any economic\r\nplan at all? The answer is that the payments for the encroachments and\r\nthe payments for the customary holdings, if they are both to be called\r\nrents, are rents of very different kinds. The payments made for the\r\ncustomary holdings are not based directly on the economic value of the\r\nland, but on the value of commuted services, and all the holdings,\r\nthough of unequal size, are liable to much the same services. All make a\r\ngeneral payment of 9-1/2d., because that sum is the value of some\r\npayment in kind or service which they had made before the money payment\r\ntook its place. Holdings of 32 acres and 22 acres, just as holdings of\r\n12-1/2 and 18-1/2 acres, make the same payments, because the labour\r\nrents had been only very roughly adjusted to the size of the holdings,\r\nand these payments are commuted labour rents, not rents fixed by putting\r\nup an acre for leasing and taking what can be got for it. It is of\r\ncourse quite true that services and the size of holdings were connected,\r\nand that therefore the money rents which took the place of services and\r\nthe size of holdings were connected also. But the connection is rough,\r\narrived at by apportioning between holdings the labour services needed\r\nto cultivate the demesne, without distinguishing precisely differences\r\nof a few acres in the size of different holdings, and the subsequent\r\nmoney rents are not adjusted to the acreage because they express the\r\nroughness of the original apportionment.\r\n\r\nNow clearly these considerations did not apply to the rents paid for the\r\nencroachments which were taken from the waste. The greater part of them\r\nhad never been liable to labour services at all. Each acre stood by\r\nitself, as it were, as simply a piece of cultivatable land of a certain\r\narea, not part of a complex on which certain obligations had been\r\nimposed. Each, therefore, gets a market value, based on what will be\r\ngiven for it, much sooner than does the land making up the customary\r\nholdings, which are not exposed to the levelling influence of the market\r\nbecause they are bound together by their place in the social\r\norganisation of the manor. Hence it is on this land, the land leased\r\npiecemeal from the waste by tenants who were prosperous enough to afford\r\nthe extra outlay, that one gets the appearance of something like true\r\ncompetitive rents, because it is here that commercial influences have\r\nfreest play and are least checked by their subordination to custom. In\r\nthe same way, when the tenants at Brightwalton[267] do the full quota of\r\nwork demanded, the rent of their customary holdings is abated\r\naccordingly. But not so the rent of the new land which was once part of\r\nthe waste: in fixing its rent the lord is not checked by any collective\r\nsense on the part of the village community; he has a free hand and will\r\nmake the best bargain he can.\r\n\r\n    [267] Camden Society, 1857. Rental and Custumal of the Manor of\r\n    Brightwalton. Under the heading virgators it is said, \"If they\r\n    do the full day's work set out above each of them ought to have\r\n    his rent reduced 12d.\" Under the heading of villeins holding\r\n    assarted land it is said, \"Be it known that no customary tenant\r\n    shall have any reduction of rent of the lands which he holds by\r\n    way of assart or in the common of Greeneholt for any office or\r\n    work to be done for the lord.\"\r\n\r\nThus, at a very early date, a fringe of leasehold land forms itself\r\nround the manor in addition to the ordinary customary holdings. Because\r\nit is on the margin of cultivation the initial rent is low, and because\r\nthe land is leased the rent can be raised. Exactly the same thing\r\napplies to the leasing of the demesne, and sometimes even to the land\r\nwhich one tenant hires from another, because here also the element of\r\ncompetition enters to adjust rents in accordance with supply and demand\r\nand with little regard to the influence of custom. When the greater part\r\nof the demesne is still cultivated by the labour of villeins, and only\r\nsmall plots are leased to the tenants by way of experiment, the bailiff\r\nbalances one method against the other, and recommends the resumption of\r\nthe land which \"would pay better in the hands of the lord.\"[268] On some\r\nmanors, it is true, demesne land seems to have been merged inextricably\r\nin the customary holdings, and to have been held later, like them, by\r\ncopy of court roll.[269] But the manorial authorities were anxious to\r\nkeep it separate precisely because it was recognised that if kept\r\nseparate it could be let at a competitive rent. Thus the charter which\r\nwas granted to the little borough of Holt[270] in Denbighshire, in 1413,\r\nprovided that the tenants should pay for \"every burgage 12d., for every\r\ncurtilage 12d., for every acre of land belonging to their free burgages\r\n12d., and for every acre of land which was wont to be of the lord's\r\ndemesne two shillings.\" And though, during the confusion of the\r\nfollowing century, much of the rent appears not to have been collected,\r\nthe Crown, of whom the burgesses hold, does not forget that a high rent\r\nwas due from the demesne, and one hundred and fifty years later requires\r\nthem to bring up their payments for it to the level fixed in 1413. At\r\nCastle Combe, in the middle of the fifteenth century, one finds the\r\nsteward of the manor watching the land market with a view to getting the\r\nbest price that he can for the demesne, and speculating whether \"any man\r\nwill ferme the parkis and the conyes at any better price above X marks\r\nthan yt ys now.\"[271] The same tendency towards competitive rents can be\r\nseen equally well in the case of the land leased by one tenant from the\r\nholdings of others, which for one reason or another have been\r\nsurrendered to the lord. Thus at Mildenhall,[272] in 1381, a villein\r\npays for his land nearly 1s. 6d. an acre, a very high rent, which is at\r\nonce explained when it is seen that his holding consists of pieces of\r\nland held on a ten years' lease from the holdings of five or more other\r\ntenants. Elsewhere one can almost see the bidding up of rents going on.\r\nFor what else can happen when the demesne lands of a manor are leased\r\nto four tenants who, in turn, make their profit by leasing them again to\r\nthe other tenants,[273] or when a villein pays £6 to enter on two acres\r\nof arable land,[274] or when land is worth 3s. 6d. an acre after the\r\nrents and services have been discharged from it to the lord,[275] so\r\nthat the holder who cares to sublet can reap a substantial profit on the\r\ndifference?\r\n\r\n    [268] Camden Society, _Inquisition of the Manors of Glastonbury\r\n    Abbey_, Brentmarsh, 1189. A tenant holds \"1 acre de terra\r\n    arabili in dominico, utilius esset quod esset in manu domini.\"\r\n\r\n    [269] _e.g._, on the Devonshire, Somerset, and Cornwall manors\r\n    surveyed by Humberstone _temp._ Phil, and Mary (_Topographer and\r\n    Genealogist_, vol. i.).\r\n\r\n    [270] MS.

I quote the writer's\r\n    remarks in full. \"The bailiff's accounts for the manor begin in\r\n    that very year [1381], and the one striking feature in them is\r\n    the system of leases which appears to have gradually displaced\r\n    other kinds of tenure since the time of the pestilence. A few\r\n    are for forty years, but most are for ten or six years.... The\r\n    land so leased is not mainly demesne land. It belongs largely to\r\n    villein tenements that have fallen into the lord's hands, and\r\n    the process of consolidation described had already taken place\r\n    at Mildenhall. The land held by John Kelsynd on a ten years'\r\n    lease includes, for example, '3 acres of Frere's, Hayward's and\r\n    Willway's tenement in Bradinhawfield, 1 acre of Holmes' tenement\r\n    in Suttonfield, 5 acres of Zabulo's tenement in one piece at\r\n    Lambwash,' and the rent of the whole 22 acres is 31s. 1d., or\r\n    nearly 1s. 5d. an acre, an extremely high rent for land not\r\n    stated to be meadow or pasture.\"\r\n\r\n    [273] Scrope, _History of the Manor and Barony of Castle Combe_,\r\n    p. 203.\r\n\r\n    [274] Massingberd, _Ingoldmells Court Rolls_, Introduction, p.\r\n    xxx.\r\n\r\n    [275] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nThe truth is that, at any rate by the middle of the fifteenth century,\r\nthe rents of different parts of a manor are being settled on quite\r\ndifferent principles. They are not all customary rents, as they tended\r\nto be at an earlier date, nor are they all competitive rents, as they\r\ntend to be to-day. The latter are growing because of the improved\r\neconomic position of the tenants, which enables them to hire or purchase\r\nland over and above their customary holdings, and their growth has been\r\ngreatly accelerated by the enormously increased opportunities for land\r\nspeculation which were offered when the Great Plague brought thousands\r\nof acres into the land market. It is in the demand put forward by the\r\nmen of Essex in 1381,[276] \"that no acre of land, which is held in\r\nvilleinage or serfdom, may be had at a higher rent than 4d.,\" rather\r\nthan in the reference to the already decaying labour services, that\r\nthere is a warning of troubles to come. But long after that, as we have\r\nalready seen, a great deal of land is still held by rents which are\r\ncustomary and little influenced as yet by the play of competition. We\r\nhave, in fact, what is almost an illustration of modern theories of\r\nrent, with this difference, that though the condition of competitive\r\nrents being charged appears as the margin of cultivation is lowered,\r\ncustom at first prevents the owners of land from taking advantage of\r\ntheir position and asking the full competitive rents from the holders of\r\nthe superior sites, so that part of the surplus is for a long time\r\nenjoyed by the tenants. Such a state of things is clearly a precarious\r\none. When the tenements of Hugh and Thomas are being rack-rented there\r\nwill obviously be a strong temptation to cause Walter's to follow suit,\r\nand if the custom is a barrier to a rise in rents, but not to a rise in\r\nfines, to make heavy fines do on the latter what high rents do on the\r\nformer. If it had been given to our peasants to happen on some monstrous\r\nmediæval Ricardo, would they not have wondered how long such an\r\nintermingling of payments fixed by custom and payments fixed by\r\ncompetition was likely to continue, and have foreseen, what actually\r\noccurred in the sixteenth century, an attempt, though not always a\r\nsuccessful attempt, to force up the payments for customary holdings to\r\nsomething like the maximum which the condition of agriculture would\r\nallow? They would have said:--\"This fellow fears not God, neither\r\nregards he man. He is a usurer, a great taker of advantages, an\r\noppressor of his neighbour. We will beat him, and put him in our stocks,\r\nand maim his cattle. Nevertheless in the bottom of his foul mind there\r\nis some glimmering of sense, and we will give heed to his warning. The\r\ndevil brings it, but it may be that God sent it. The Court shall recite\r\nour good customs once more, and our young men shall look to their bows.\r\nWeapon bodeth peace.\"[277]\r\n\r\n    [276] Stubbs, _Constl. Hist._, vol. ii. p. 479, n. 5.\r\n\r\n    [277] The word \"usury\" denoted in the Middle Ages and in the\r\n    sixteenth century not merely exorbitant interest on a loan, but\r\n    any oppressive bargain, including the raising of prices, the\r\n    beating down of wages, and the rack-renting of land (see _e.g. A\r\n    Discourse on Usurie_, by Thomas Wilson, 1584). The phrase \"a\r\n    great taker of advantages\" comes from a complaint by the people\r\n    of Hereford against an unpopular divine who lent money at\r\n    interest and rack-rented land (_S. P. D. Eliz._, cclxxxvi. Nos.\r\n    19 and 20), and the phrase \"weapon bodeth peace\" from an account\r\n    of an agrarian dispute in Lancashire--it is the sort of grim\r\n    joke that stubborn and humorous people would appreciate--in _L.\r\n    and P. Henry VIII._, vol. xiii., Pt. II., p. 535. \"On Sunday\r\n    night Wheateley sent his daughter to bid him to come to Parson's\r\n    Close to mow Mr. Tempest's meadow there. Had heard that whoever\r\n    should mow the meadow should be beaten off the ground, and sent\r\n    to ask if he should bring a weapon. Wheateley sent word again\r\n    'howe weapon boded peace, therefore bring his weapon with him.'\r\n    Brought his bow and shafts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(g) _The Progress of Enclosure among the Peasantry_\r\n\r\nWhile competitive conditions are creeping forward on those parts of the\r\nvillage lands which have been most recently taken in, even more\r\nmomentous changes are occurring on the customary holdings themselves. By\r\nthe end of the fifteenth century we are walking through fields that are\r\nbeing cut up with the hedges which give the dullest English landscape\r\nthe trim beauty of a garden. For a century and a half, while in the\r\ngreat world the new state rises on the ruins of the Middle Ages, while\r\nTudors give way to Stuarts, and Stuarts browbeat and are browbeaten by\r\never more impatient Parliaments, in courts customary and sometimes in\r\nnoisier assemblies not without arms, we shall be discussing whether\r\nthose hedges are to stand or fall. The great enclosing movement has\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nLike most great economic changes it has begun quietly and for a long\r\ntime men are doubtful whether it is a great change at all, and, if it is\r\nmischievous, in what exactly the mischief consists. Nor indeed does the\r\nmass of the population, who feel the new conditions most, ever become\r\nquite clear on this point. Events are too various and move too swiftly\r\nfor them. They see that great men enclose with little regard to the\r\ninterests of their poorer neighbours. They curse them for their\r\nenclosures,[278] and believe with the faith of an age which has\r\nre-discovered the Bible, that they, like greedy Ahab, the father of\r\nenclosers, will be cursed. When the encloser should call on God to\r\nwitness his deed the devil's name starts to his lips. His cattle are\r\nstruck by lightning, and his children do not live to reap the fruits of\r\nhis iniquity. But the peasants enclose themselves, and though they feel\r\nthe difference between one sort of enclosing and another, they are\r\nsimple men who cannot make the matter plain to lawyers and\r\ncommissioners, and when things reach a certain point they will fight it\r\nout.\r\n\r\n    [278] For the popular attitude towards enclosures see below, pp.\r\n    313?-340, and Leland (quoted Hone, _The Manor and Manorial\r\n    Records_, p. 117): \"The Duke of Buckingham made a fair park by\r\n    the Castle of Thornbury, Gloucestershire, and took very much\r\n    fair land in, very fruitful of corn, now fair lands for\r\n    coursing. The inhabitants cursed the Duke for those lands so\r\n    enclosed.\" I cannot refrain from quoting the following passage\r\n    (_Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. iii): \"To the Right Honble.\r\n    House of Parliament now assembled, the Humble Petition of the\r\n    Mayor and Free Tenants of the Borough of Wootton Basset in the\r\n    Countie of Wilts, Humble sheweth to this Honourable House\" [that\r\n    their common has been seized and enclosed by the lord of the\r\n    manor, who] \"did divers times attempt to gaine the possession\r\n    thereof by putting in of divers sorts of cattle, in so much that\r\n    at length, when his servants did put in cowes by force into the\r\n    said common, many times and present upon the putting of them in,\r\n    the Lord in his mercy did send thunder and lightning from\r\n    heaven, which did make the cattle of the said Francis Englefield\r\n    [the lord of the Manor] to run so violent out of the said\r\n    ground, that at one time one of the beasts was killed therewith;\r\n    and it was so often that people that were not there in presence\r\n    to see it, when it thundered would say, Sir Francis Englefield's\r\n    men were putting in their cattle into the land, and so it was,\r\n    and as soon as those cattle were gone forth, it would presently\r\n    be very calm and fair, and the cattle of the towne would never\r\n    stir, but follow their feeding as at other times, and never\r\n    offer to move out of the way.\" For the allusion to invoking the\r\n    devil, see Moore, _The Crying Sin of England_, &c. It was said\r\n    that the grantees of monastic estates died out in three\r\n    generations (Erdeswick, _Survey of Stafford_, ed. Harwood, p.\r\n    55). The same was said of enclosers (Moore, _op. cit._).\r\n\r\nIn every age there are words which are sufficiently definite to become a\r\nbattle-cry, and yet which contain so many shades of meaning and are\r\nsusceptible of such varying interpretations, that those who seem to\r\ndiffer most profoundly really differ because they are using the same\r\nword to express quite different ideas. Such a word was enclosing. For\r\nmany years it was a burning question--with statesmen, with preachers,\r\nwith the mass of the peasantry. But those who tell us exactly what it\r\nmeant are few, and they tell us hardly more than is sufficient to show\r\nthat it meant several different things in different connections. The\r\npicture of enclosure which carried Ket's followers against the walls of\r\nNorwich was that immortalised two centuries later in Goldsmith's\r\n\"Deserted Village\"; a vision of village cornfields turned into dreary\r\nexpanses of pasture, where sheep grazed amid ruined homesteads and\r\ncattle were stalled in the mouldering churches.[279] When the scientific\r\nagriculturists of the age eulogised enclosures, they thought of a more\r\norderly and productive cultivation arising in place of the intolerable\r\n\"mingle mangle\" of the open fields. The Levellers, who in the\r\nseventeenth century carried on the agitation against enclosure, had no\r\nobjection to such as took place \"only or chiefly for the benefit of the\r\npoor.\"[280] The panegyrists of enclosing like Fitzherbert and Norden\r\ndenounced[281] lords who made enclosure an occasion to rack-rent and\r\ndepopulate. The Justices of Nottinghamshire[282] complain to the\r\nGovernment that enclosure drives people into the already overburdened\r\ntowns, but they are careful to explain that enclosures of less than five\r\nacres in size improve agriculture without depopulating the country. The\r\nGovernment itself under Elizabeth sets its face against the enclosures\r\nwhich produce evictions, but nevertheless expressly sanctions the\r\nexchanging of strips, which is desired chiefly in order that small\r\nenclosures may be made.[283] In this phase of the eternal quarrel\r\nbetween the plain man and the technical expert both the technical expert\r\nand the plain man were right, and needed only a definition to unite\r\nagainst the avarice and oppression which snatched a golden harvest from\r\ntheir confusion. It is the tragedy of a world where man must walk by\r\nsight that the discovery of the reconciling formula is always left to\r\nfuture generations, in which passion has cooled into curiosity, and the\r\nagonies of peoples have become the exercise of the schools. The devil\r\nwho builds bridges does not span such chasms till much that is precious\r\nto mankind has vanished down them for ever.\r\n\r\n    [279] See the ballad of Nowadays (1520):\r\n\r\n        \"Envy waxeth wonders strong,\r\n        The Riche doth the poore wrong,\r\n        God of his mercy sufferith long\r\n        The Devil his workes to worke.\r\n        The Townes go downe, the land decayes;\r\n        Of cornefeldes playne layes,\r\n        Gret men makithe now a dayes\r\n            A shepecote in the Church.\r\n\r\n        The places that we Right holy call\r\n        Ordeyned ffor Christyan buriall\r\n        Off them to make an ox-stall\r\n        These men be wonders wyse;\r\n        Commons to close and kepe,\r\n        Poor folk for bred to cry and wepe;\r\n        Towns pulled down to pastur shepe,\r\n            This ys the newe gyse.\"\r\n\r\n    [280] \"The Leveller's Petition\" (Bodleian Pamphlets, 1648, c.\r\n    15, 3, Linc.).\r\n\r\n    [281] Fitzherbert, _Surveying_: \"I advertise and exhort in God's\r\n    behalf all manner of persons, that ... the lords do not heighten\r\n    the rents of their tenants or cause them to pay more rent or a\r\n    greater fine. A greater bribery and extortion a man cannot do\r\n    than upon his own tenants, for they dare not say him naye, nor\r\n    yet complain.\" Norden, _The Surveyor's Dialogue_, Book III.:\r\n    \"Lords should not depopulate by usurping enclosures, a thing\r\n    hateful to God and offensive to man.\"\r\n\r\n    [282] _Victoria County History, Nottinghamshire_, vol. ii. p.\r\n    282.\r\n\r\n    [283] 39 Eliz. c. i.\r\n\r\nOne such distinction, however, we must draw at once. Enclosure is\r\nusually thought of in connection with the encroachments made by lords of\r\nmanors or their farmers upon the land over which the manorial population\r\nhad common rights or which lay in the open arable fields. And this is on\r\nthe whole correct. This is what the word would have suggested to nine\r\nmen out of ten in our period: this aspect of the movement was the most\r\nrapid in its development and the most far-reaching in its effects. But\r\nthere was another side to it which was at once earlier in point of time\r\nand productive of quite dissimilar results. There is abundant evidence\r\nto show that the open field system of agriculture, with its intermingled\r\nstrips and its collective, as opposed to individual, rules of\r\ncultivation, was undergoing a gradual dissolution from within even\r\nbefore the larger innovations of great capitalists gave it a shock from\r\nwithout. At the very time when the peasantry agitated most bitterly they\r\nwere often hedging and ditching their own little holdings and nibbling\r\naway fragments of the waste to be cultivated in severalty. It is, of\r\ncourse, true that the effect of enclosure by the lord of a manor or\r\nlarge farmer was usually very different from that of enclosure by the\r\ncustomary tenants. The latter was a slow process of attrition, which\r\nwent on quietly from one generation to another, often no doubt after\r\ndiscussions in the manorial court. The former was frequently an\r\ninvasion. But though their social effects were dissimilar, from a\r\ntechnical point of view they were both part of the process through which\r\ncultivation at the discretion of the individual was substituted for\r\ncultivation in accordance with common customary rules. Enclosing by\r\nlords and large farmers was not so much a movement running counter to\r\nexisting tendencies, as a continuation on a larger scale and with\r\ndifferent results of developments which in parts of England were already\r\nat work. Great changes are best interpreted in the light of small, and\r\nit will therefore be worth our while to look shortly at the sort of\r\nenclosing which was being carried out by the peasantry themselves.\r\n\r\nFirst, one may review briefly what is told us by those who wrote on the\r\ntechnique of agriculture. Fitzherbert[284] and Hales in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, Norden and Lee in the seventeenth, make it quite plain that,\r\napart from enclosures carried out by lords of manors, a movement is\r\ngoing on among the tenants which is also known by the name of enclosure.\r\nIt has as its object the formation of compact fields out of the\r\nscattered strips, and the substitution of closes surrounded by hedges\r\nfor rights of grazing over the common pasture, meadow, and waste. It\r\nhas as its effects a great increase in the output of wheat,\r\nopportunities for better grazing and stock-breeding, and a consequent\r\nrise in the value of land; the improvement being partly due to\r\npsychological[285] reasons, to the fact that a man who has a free hand\r\nwill put more labour into the land than one who is fettered by customary\r\nrules, partly to technical causes such as the better draining and\r\ncleaning of land which the enclosure of arable ground makes possible,\r\nthe greater security offered against damage done by straying cattle, the\r\nimprovement in the quality of pasture when it is no longer liable to be\r\neaten bare by the beasts of a whole township. The method by which such a\r\nchange takes place is re-allotment. The construction of\r\nhedges--enclosing--is simply the machinery by which the new lines of\r\ndemarcation between one man's land and another's are drawn and kept\r\nfirmly in their place; and though the word _enclosure_ gives a vivid\r\npicture of the alteration which is produced in the appearance of the\r\ncountry, _re-allotment_ or _redivision_ of land describes much better\r\nthe process by which it is brought about. The ideal form of it is\r\ndescribed by Fitzherbert.[286] All the landlords in a village must come\r\nto an agreement that their tenants should exchange their holdings with\r\neach other. An exact statement of the area of land in tillage and\r\npasture held by each tenant must then be made. When this has been done,\r\nevery man is \"to change with his neighbour, and to leye them (_i.e._ the\r\nacres, which were formerly scattered) together, and to make him one\r\nseveral close in every field, to leye them together in one field and to\r\nmake one several close for them all; and also another several close for\r\nhis portion of his common pasture, and also his portion of his meadow in\r\na several close by itself, and all kept in several both winter and\r\nsummer. And every cottager to have his portion assigned to him according\r\nto his rent.\" Such enclosure does not, it is contended, interfere\r\nunfairly with any one's vested interests. It makes a spatial\r\nrearrangement of property, but it does not alter its economic\r\ndistribution. It does not result in evictions or depopulation. It simply\r\nconverts rights exercised jointly over a larger area into rights\r\nexercised individually over a smaller one. The map is dissolved into\r\nscattered pieces, but it is put together again; and when it is put\r\ntogether all the pieces are still there. The tenants part with shares in\r\nthe common fields, meadows, and pastures, to get smaller fields,\r\nmeadows, and pastures to themselves. The latter are more valuable than\r\nthe former. What is lost in extension is gained in intension.\r\n\r\n    [284] Fitzherbert, _Book of Husbandry_. Norden, _op. cit._: \"One\r\n    acre enclosed is worth one and halfe in common.\" _Commonweal of\r\n    this Realm of England_, p. 56. Lee, _A Vindication of a\r\n    Regulated Enclosure_.\r\n\r\n    [285] _Commonweal of this Realm of England_, p. 49: \"That which\r\n    is possessed of many in common is neglected of all.\"\r\n\r\n    [286] Fitzherbert, _Surveying_, chap. xl.\r\n\r\nBut this account is an ideal one, a description of the most excellent\r\nway, not necessarily a description of what is being actually done. For\r\nthat we must turn to the surveys. In the picture of agriculture which is\r\ngiven by the surveyors one can see the open field system of cultivation\r\nat almost every stage of completeness and disintegration at different\r\nplaces. On many manors there is hardly any sign of the scattered strips,\r\nwhich make up the individual tenant's holding, coalescing into\r\ncompactness, hardly any sign of encroachments upon either the common\r\npasture or the meadow or the waste. Elsewhere one finds that though the\r\nbulk of the land still lies in the open fields, and though the greater\r\npart of the meadow and pasture is undivided, a considerable proportion\r\nhas been enclosed by the tenants and is held in severalty. Elsewhere one\r\nfinds the common meadow split up and the arable enclosed, the arable\r\nenclosed and the waste unenclosed, or all of them enclosed more or less\r\ncompletely. It would be of great interest and importance to determine\r\nthe relative preponderance of enclosure by the tenants in different\r\nparts of the country, and to see how far the districts where this type\r\nof enclosure by consent had been commonest were identical with those\r\nwhere the reports of the Royal Commissions of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries show that depopulating enclosures made least way.\r\nVery probably it would be found that the latter movement went on least\r\nrapidly where the former had proceeded furthest, and that where the\r\ntenants themselves had from an early date substituted enclosed for open\r\nfield husbandry, as apparently they had in Kent, Essex, Cornwall, and\r\nparts of Devonshire[287] they had least to fear from that kind of\r\nenclosure which was accompanied by encroachments on the part of manorial\r\nauthorities, and which seems to have produced most dislocation in the\r\nMidlands and Eastern counties. But this is a suggestion which our\r\nmaterial is too scanty either to confirm or disprove. Enclosure by\r\nconsent did not cause popular disorder; and therefore we cannot say,\r\ntaking the country as a whole, how far enclosure on the part of the bulk\r\nof the smaller tenants had proceeded. We can only give cases which show\r\nthat on some manors it had advanced very far, and which bear out the\r\nevidence of the writers on agriculture as to there being a well-defined\r\nmovement away from open field husbandry on the part of the peasants\r\nthemselves, without attempting to determine its extent or its\r\ngeographical distribution.\r\n\r\n    [287] _Commonweal of this Realm of England_, p. 49. _Victoria\r\n    County History_, Essex. I am inclined to say \"almost certainly\"\r\n    rather than \"very probably\" (see below, pp. 167 and 262?-263).\r\n\r\nLook, first, for example, at the picture given by the Commission of\r\n1517. Thanks to Mr. Leadam,[288] we are able to say what the average\r\nacreage of the enclosures in each county represented was, what\r\nproportion of the enclosures was due to lords of manors, lay or\r\necclesiastical, and what proportion was due to the tenants. Now it is\r\ngenerally, though not universally, true that the enclosures reported to\r\nthis Commission fall into two main types. The first consists of\r\nconsiderable enclosures carried out mainly by lords of manors. The\r\nsecond consists of smaller enclosures carried out mainly by other\r\nclasses. Thus the five districts where the average size of the\r\nenclosures made is largest are Cambridgeshire, Gloucestershire,\r\nYorkshire North Riding, Yorkshire West Riding, Yorkshire East Riding,\r\nwhere it is 129, 96, 84, 77, 62 acres respectively, and in these the\r\nproportion of the enclosures which is due to the lords of manors is high\r\nalso--72 per cent., 52 per cent., 79 per cent., 92 per cent., 64 per\r\ncent. Contrast with the position in these counties that obtaining in\r\nBerkshire, in Salop, and in London and its suburbs. In Berkshire the\r\naverage size of an enclosure is 32 acres, in Salop 18, in London 10, and\r\nin these districts the lords play a much smaller part in enclosing.\r\nThey are responsible for 42 per cent. of the acreage enclosed in\r\nBerkshire, 12 per cent. of that enclosed in Salop, 3 per cent. of that\r\nenclosed in the vicinity of London. Does not this suggest that in parts\r\nof the country--we cannot yet say what parts--there is much small\r\nenclosing by small men?\r\n\r\n    [288] _Trans. R. H. S._, New Series, vol. vi., and _The Domesday\r\n    of Enclosures_.\r\n\r\nTurn next to the story told by the surveys. Though Wiltshire is on the\r\nwhole a country of recent enclosure, there was a certain amount of\r\nseveral farming on the part of the customary tenants on the Wiltshire\r\nmanors in the middle of the sixteenth century. Out of 4128-1/4 acres\r\nheld by them on eight manors the surveys show that 202-1/4 acres lie in\r\ncloses.[289] This is a very small proportion, only 5 per cent., and\r\nsuggests that on most of them the holdings lay in the open fields, and\r\nthat, as a general rule, the common utilisation of meadows and pastures\r\nstill obtained. On one, however, as much as 132 acres out of 1103, or\r\njust under 12 per cent. were enclosed, and at best these are minimum\r\nfigures which do not accurately represent how far the movement had gone;\r\nfor, though a surveyor would not describe unenclosed land as enclosed,\r\nhe might very well class enclosed land with other land of the same\r\ndescription, for example as meadow or pasture, and omit to state that it\r\nwas occupied in severalty. On some Staffordshire[290] manors again there\r\nare similar tentative beginnings of enclosure, and a similar\r\nimpossibility of determining its actual extent. Then, too, there are\r\nmanors where the greater part of the land still lies in the open fields,\r\nbut where enclosure has proceeded a little further. At Salford,[291] in\r\nBedfordshire, eight of the tenants have enclosed about 51 acres, which\r\nthey hold separate from, and in addition to, their holdings in the open\r\nfields, in amounts varying from 2 to 17 acres. At Weeden Weston,[292]\r\nin Northamptonshire, the three largest tenants (apart from the farmer of\r\nthe demesne) hold \"in several ground enclosed\" 28 acres. In addition to\r\nthis, part of the manor called \"the mere land,\" the exact nature of\r\nwhich is obscure, has been broken off and split up among all the\r\nfourteen tenants, some holding only 2 or 3 acres, others holding 15 or\r\n20 acres. Finally, as examples of manors where enclosure by the\r\ncustomary tenants was carried furthest, we may take those of\r\nEdgeware[293] and Kingsbury in Middlesex. From the admirable maps of\r\nthese two manors, which were made in 1597, no one could even guess that\r\nthe open field method of cultivation had ever existed there. The land of\r\neach of the numerous tenants lies in fields, often quite small fields,\r\nwhich are separated from each other by hedges. Instead of the \"spider's\r\nweb\" of the older method we have the irregular chessboard of modern\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\n    [289] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of the Manors of William, First\r\n    Earl of Pembroke_. The manors are South Newton, Washerne,\r\n    Donnington, Knyghton Estoverton and Phiphelde, Wynterbourne\r\n    Basset, Byschopeston, and South Brent and Huish (the last in\r\n    Somersetshire.) The manor where most is enclosed by the\r\n    customary tenants is Donnington.\r\n\r\n    [290] _e.g._, R.O. Rentals and Surveys, Gen. Ser., Portf. 14,\r\n    No. 70, Barton (3 & 4 Ph. and Mary): \"J. Whiting ... 1 close of\r\n    7 acres by copy ... J. Whiting ... 1/2 virgate ... 1 intake of 2\r\n    acres by copy.\"\r\n\r\n    [291] All Souls' Maps (survey on back of map of Salford).\r\n\r\n    [292] _Ibid._, Weedon Weston.\r\n\r\n    [293] _Ibid._, Edgeware and Kingbury. All these four instances\r\n    come from the last decade of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThese instances tell us nothing of the origin, extent, or distribution\r\nof the movement which they represent. They are useful merely as offering\r\nconcrete specimens of enclosure on the parts of free and customary\r\ntenants, which confirm what is told us by the surveyors. There was\r\ncertainly a well-defined trend away from the methods of common field\r\nagriculture taking place in the course of the sixteenth century and\r\nbefore it on the part of the peasantry. We can, however, go further than\r\nthis; and premising that in the infinite variety of rural conditions in\r\ndifferent parts of the country any classification must be somewhat\r\narbitrary, we can distinguish two main elements in the movement.\r\n\r\nIn the first place there is among the tenants on some manors something\r\nlike a deliberate movement towards the substitution of \"several\" for\r\nopen field husbandry. This was a change which occurred almost\r\nspontaneously when the economic interests of the majority of tenants\r\nwere pushing in the same direction, and can be seen affecting both\r\npasture, meadow, and arable holdings. The Commission[294] of 1517 found\r\nthat in certain places land had been enclosed neither by individual\r\nlandlords, nor by individual tenants, but by \"the village,\" and the\r\nmanorial documents give us a clue to what such entries mean. In the\r\nsurveys of the sixteenth century we not infrequently find that meadows\r\nand pastures which were originally occupied in common have been split up\r\namong the tenants, so that each has the exclusive occupation of a few\r\nacres, the share which each tenant takes being proportioned more or less\r\nexactly to his holding of arable in a manner which precludes the idea\r\nthat the change can have taken place by piecemeal individual\r\nencroachments, or in any way except by an intentional redistribution of\r\nland, in which the interests of all the tenants received\r\nconsideration.[295] Such a division of meadow and pasture is paralleled\r\nby cases in which the re-allotment of arable holdings is carried out\r\nboth by freeholders and by copyholders almost exactly in the manner\r\nprescribed by Fitzherbert. Thus at Ewerne,[296] in Dorsetshire, the\r\ncustomary tenants got permission from the lord to make enclosure on the\r\nopen fields; appointed persons to \"extend and tread them out,\" and then\r\nunited the dispersed strips into compact holdings, so that \"the more\r\npart of the manor was enclosed, and every tenant and farmer occupied his\r\nland several to himself.\" At Mudford, in Somersetshire, the tenants were\r\nfound by the surveyor in 1568 to be contemplating the same step. A\r\nsimilar course was taken in the early seventeenth century on several\r\nNorthumbrian manors, of which Cowpen[297] may be taken as a typical\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n    [294] _e.g._ Whitecote (Salop) 40 acres, and at Wyndeferthing\r\n    (Norf.) 25 acres are enclosed by the _villata_ (see Leadam,\r\n    _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, New Series, vol. vi.).\r\n\r\n    [295] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Pembroke Manors_. At Washerne\r\n    nineteen out of twenty-one customary tenants held separate\r\n    pieces of meadow and pasture, the largest 7-1/2 and the smallest\r\n    3-1/2 acres, but usually almost equal. At Donnyngton, twelve out\r\n    of thirty-two customary tenants had pieces of land \"extractum de\r\n    communia.\" R.O. Rentals and Surveys, Duchy of Lancaster, Bdle.\r\n    3, No. 29, Agarsley (Staffs., 1611).; here the pasture appears\r\n    to have been divided up among the copyholders, but there are\r\n    considerable inequalities in their shares.\r\n\r\n    [296] _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n    [297] _Northumberland County History_, vol. ix. In this case\r\n    enclosure was carried out by the freeholders. But the procedure\r\n    is similar to that at Ewerne. The allusion to \"justice and\r\n    right\" shows what the reason for the intermixing of strips had\r\n    been.\r\n\r\nThe procedure followed by the freeholders of that township was to get\r\ntheir land surveyed by an expert, to divide it into two great portions,\r\nand to agree that each man should have an allotment in one or other of\r\nthe two divisions proportionate to the holding which he had occupied in\r\nthe open fields, due regard being had to the quality as well as the\r\nacreage of each holding, \"so that some have not all the best ground and\r\nothers all the worst, but that each man have justice and right.\" Such\r\ninstances may prove to be exceptional in the sixteenth century; it is\r\nour impression that they were, and that the attempts which the peasantry\r\nmade to overcome the difficulties associated with the open field system\r\nof cultivation more often took the form of individual exchanging of\r\nstrips, than of a formal agreement to abandon one method of cultivation\r\nand to adopt another. But, even though exceptional, they are of some\r\ninterest as offering complete examples of changes which have been going\r\non more generally on a smaller scale and in a less systematic manner.\r\nThey afford a striking contrast to the enclosing by the manorial\r\nauthorities which we shall examine in a future chapter, and offer an\r\nanalogy to the enclosures which were carried out in the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries. They resemble the latter in being a deliberate\r\nattempt to make a clean sweep of the old system of open field\r\nagriculture. They differ from them in being the outcome of voluntary\r\nagreement among the tenants, not of legislation.[298]\r\n\r\n    [298] We know why lords wanted to enclose much better than we\r\n    know why tenants wanted to enclose. Here is a petition from a\r\n    freeholder (_Northumberland County History_, vol. v. undated):\r\n    \"To the Right Honourable Earl of Northumberland, William Bednell\r\n    ... gent., humbly prayeth: That where the said village of Over\r\n    Buston is held in common ... it would please your good lordship\r\n    to consent that partition may be made of the same, and that also\r\n    there may be convenient exchange of the arable lands lyinge in\r\n    the common fields there to be rateable reduced into severall by\r\n    the same partition for the reasons under-written.\r\n\r\n    \"First, for that the common and pasture of the said village\r\n    lying open, unfenced upon the common and fields of Wordon and\r\n    Bilton, wherein are many tenants and great number of cattle, the\r\n    profits of the same are continually by them surcharged, and your\r\n    lordship's tenants prevented.\r\n\r\n    \"By reason hereof divers quarrels and variances have happened,\r\n    and daily like to ensue between the tenants of both towns, by\r\n    chasing, rechasing, and impounding of their cattle damage\r\n    fezant, which cannot be kept out but by perpetual staffherding,\r\n    to the great charge of your honour's poor tenants.\r\n\r\n    \"Your lordship's tenants being four in number, unprovided to\r\n    keep able horses by reason of the want of convenient pastures\r\n    and meadow, may be enabled by this particion for that purpose.\r\n\r\n    \"Inclosure would greatly strengthen the said village, and your\r\n    lordship's tenants, against the incursions of Scotts and foren\r\n    ryders, which otherwyse, lying open, cannot be defended by the\r\n    number there, who are forced to watch generally together every\r\n    night, to their great charge and endurable toil.\r\n\r\n    \"This breeding betterment to the soil and ease to your\r\n    lordship's tenants will augment your honour's revenue there,\r\n    avoid forren commoners, prevent contentions, enable your\r\n    lordship's tenants to do your honour their requisite service,\r\n    and bind your orator to pray that your lordship live long in\r\n    happy state.\"\r\n\r\nMuch more general, however, than enclosure by agreement of the whole\r\ntownship, is the enclosure which takes place through the initiative of\r\nindividual tenants, who, without any common agreement as to a policy of\r\nenclosure being reached by the village community as a whole, make\r\nsporadic encroachments on the common pasture or waste, and consolidate\r\ntheir arable holdings by exchanging strips with their neighbours. Our\r\nbest information on the first point is obtained from the manorial court\r\nrolls. The court was the guardian of the customary methods of\r\ncultivation. How far it could maintain them against a lord or his farmer\r\nwho wished to break them down, and how far it was merely his mouthpiece,\r\nis a difficult question, which we need not at present discuss. Certainly\r\nit did occasionally uphold the common rule of the township even against\r\nthe lord; certainly the mere fact that when that rule is uncertain the\r\nlord refers the matter to the court in the form of a series of questions\r\nwhich it is to answer, gave the tenants the opportunity of building up a\r\nkind of case law which can hardly have failed to act as a brake upon\r\narbitrary action by the manorial authorities. But however impotent it\r\nmay often have been when confronted by an enclosing lord of the manor,\r\nits rules set very effective limits to the discretion exercised by\r\ntenants in their agricultural arrangements, and it checked enclosing by\r\nindividuals for several reasons. It was of the essence of the open field\r\nsystem of tillage, and of the joint use of common meadows and pastures,\r\nthat unauthorised encroachments by a single tenant should be an\r\ninconvenience to his neighbours. If made on the arable, they might\r\ninterfere with the customary rotation of crops, and would certainly\r\ndiminish the area of land available for the village cattle on the\r\nfallows and after harvest. If made on the common waste, they threw the\r\nvillage economy into confusion by upsetting the arrangements under\r\nwhich each holding could place so many beasts to be grazed there. \"It\r\nis both law and reason,\" wrote a surveyor grieved by such aggression on\r\nthe part of a large tenant, \"that every tenant of like land and like\r\nrent have like portion in all things upon the common pasture.\"[299] The\r\ncourt, as the upholder of manorial custom, was occupied with discovering\r\nand checking breaches of it. On manors where there was not sufficient\r\ngrazing land to allow of each tenant pasturing as many beasts as he\r\npleased, it fixed \"the stint\" which each was allowed to turn out on the\r\ncommon. It decided whether rights of pasture were confined to old\r\ntenements or whether they could be extended to cottages recently\r\nerected. It made rules as to what fields should be sown with what crops.\r\nIt would fine a man \"for refusing to consult his neighbours touching the\r\ncommon affairs of the township.\"[300]\r\n\r\n    [299] _Northumberland County History_, vol. v. The Surveyor of\r\n    Buston (1569).\r\n\r\n    [300] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nSuch action does not, of course, necessarily imply any highly developed\r\ncommunal organisation of village life. When four householders to-day\r\nbring an action against a fifth who has interfered with \"ancient\r\nlights,\" they act simply as individuals who are temporarily united in\r\ndefence of a common interest, and when a court customary fines a man for\r\nover-stocking the common pasture, it is possible to argue that there is\r\nno more in its action than the temporary alliance of individuals to\r\nsuppress a nuisance. Yet such a view of the matter is incomplete. The\r\ncommon interest is there in both cases; but in the case of the village\r\ncommunity it is a permanent, not merely a passing, ground for\r\nco-operation; and if we must take to heart the warnings given by some\r\nlegal historians not to see communism where there is only joint action,\r\nwe must also insist that common action, which is in effect communal\r\naction, is quite possible without those who act either possessing, or\r\nfeeling the need of possessing, any definite status.[301] It is perhaps\r\nnot too presumptuous to suggest that the very precision with which the\r\nlawyer applies his keen analysis of juristic conceptions to remove the\r\nmisconceptions of the lay mind, is sometimes an obstacle to the\r\nunderstanding of forms of organisation created by the daily routine of\r\nmen quite unversed in the law. An employers' association or a trade\r\nunion to-day in an industry which is not highly organised is, during\r\ntwo-thirds of its life, a mere collection of individuals. But in an\r\nemergency it can show very effectively that it is the organ of a common\r\nwill. It is surely rather hard to deny the peasantry some measure of\r\ncorporate management of common interests because they cannot answer\r\nquestions as to the legal nature of a corporation, because they do not\r\nexpress their communal arrangements by the use of terms of art which\r\nthey would not have understood. The economist, at any rate, will look at\r\npractice rather than theory. He will be inclined to doubt whether the\r\nvillagers were any clearer as to the basis of their associated action\r\nthan the mass of trade unionists were between 1875 and 1906. But he will\r\nsee that, like trade unionists, they do in fact habitually act together\r\nand act effectively for the regulation of their common interests. No\r\ndoubt such action was often mere adherence to a customary rule. But it\r\nis possible again to draw the antithesis between custom and organisation\r\ntoo sharply. After all custom does not work by itself. Especially in\r\ntimes of change, like the sixteenth century, it only works in so far as\r\nmen make it work. On some manors it is frequently changed by the court,\r\nand clearly, when it is changed, we have not automatism but deliberate\r\naction.\r\n\r\n    [301] For references to the discussion on this point, see below,\r\n    p. 244.\r\n\r\nBut the power of a rule is not recognised till it is broken, and it is\r\njust these collisions between the plan of cultivation upheld by the\r\ncourt and the interests of individual tenants, which show how prevalent\r\nare the small enclosures made by the latter. They begin very early and\r\nare increasingly frequent throughout the fifteenth century. Let us make\r\nthe picture more precise by giving one or two instances. In 1405 some\r\ncustomary tenants at Forncett[302] are fined 2s. 2d. because \"they have\r\nmade enclosures of their lands within the manor against the custom of\r\nthe manor, on account of which action the tenants of the manor are not\r\nable to have their common there.\" In 1418 the court at Castle[303] Combe\r\npresents that three tenants \"have sown the common fields and kept them\r\nseveral without the licence of the lord, when they ought to be common,\r\nto the common damage.\" At Ingoldmells,[304] in 1437, the court impounds\r\nthe sheep of some tenants who have \"entered upon the fields of Burgh and\r\noccupied the common there, where they have no common.\" At Coventry[305]\r\nfrom the middle of the fifteenth century, and at Southampton[306]\r\nthroughout almost the whole of the century and a half following,\r\ncontinuous war was waged by the Court Leet against those who \"oppressed\r\nthe common\" by over-stocking it with more than their authorised quota of\r\nbeasts. Yet, in spite of elaborate and ever-changing regulations which\r\nwere made as to the number which any person might place upon it, in\r\nspite of bye-laws requiring them to be delivered personally or through a\r\nservant into the charge of the town herdsman, ruling off aged animals\r\nwhich were past work, and imposing heavy fines on offenders, the\r\nconstant references in the documents of the sixteenth century to pieces\r\nof land which are held by customary tenants in severalty show that this\r\nsporadic individualising of part of the manorial area had to a great\r\nextent broken down the customary routine of cultivation, even on manors\r\nwhere no extensive enclosures were carried out by the manorial\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n    [302] Davenport, _History of a Norfolk Manor_, p. 80.\r\n\r\n    [303] Scrope, _History of the Manor and Barony of Castle Combe_,\r\n    p. 236.\r\n\r\n    [304] Massingberd, _Ingoldmells Court Rolls_, p. 276.\r\n\r\n    [305] M.D. Harris, _Coventry Leet Book_, vol. ii., pp. 445, 456,\r\n    510, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    [306] Hearnshaw, _Court Leet Records of Southampton, passim,\r\n    e.g._ 1551: \"Thomas Betts and Thomas Fuller continue to oppress\r\n    the common with sheep, therefore they are fined 8s. each\" (p.\r\n    21).\r\n\r\nSo far we have spoken of the encroachments by tenants on the common\r\npasture. The growth of several occupation could occur there with less\r\ndisturbance than on the arable holdings, because, if the pasture was a\r\nlarge one, the clipping off of a corner might leave the other tenants\r\nwith more than was sufficient for their cattle. But enclosure made by\r\none tenant on the open arable fields created a disturbance which was\r\nimmediate and obvious. Indeed, if his holding lay in scattered strips,\r\nseparated from each other by the strips of his neighbours, how could he\r\nenclose at all? He would at once come into collision with their demand\r\nthat his holding should lie open for grazing purposes after harvest.\r\nMoreover, even from his own point of view, enclosure could hardly\r\npay, for he would have to put hedges round each of 30 or 40 or 50 acre\r\nand half acre plots. One would expect, therefore, that individual\r\ntenants would be slow to undertake the hedging and ditching of their\r\narable holdings; and this expectation is on the whole confirmed by the\r\nimpression which one gets from the surveys and from the accounts of\r\ncontemporaries.[307] On the tenants' arable land enclosure has not\r\nproceeded by the middle of the sixteenth century as far as on their\r\npasture and meadow. Yet, even in this matter, the tendency is perhaps to\r\nexaggerate the stability of agricultural conditions. Even on the arable\r\nfields themselves individual tenants set themselves to overcome the\r\nobstacles in the way of enclosure, and they do so in the only way they\r\ncan, by attempting first of all to consolidate their strips into larger\r\nholdings. This tendency is revealed most clearly by the open field maps.\r\nThe picture of mediæval agriculture, to which Mr. Seebohm has accustomed\r\nus, is one in which holdings were made up of strips which lay scattered\r\nover the open fields at a considerable distance from each other. In the\r\nsixteenth century this condition of things survived in its entirety on\r\nmany manors and partially on most. But, side by side with it, there is\r\ngoing on a process by which the strips coalesce into larger bundles, so\r\nthat one tenant's pieces of land, instead of being far apart, very often\r\nlie next to each other, forming blocks of several acres. Those who make\r\nmaps show the change by putting brackets round the contiguous\r\nstrips.[308] Written surveys, instead of describing parts of holdings\r\nwith the words \"lying between the land of A and the land of B,\" call\r\nattention to the new condition of things, which is still sufficiently\r\nunusual to deserve remark, with the words \"lying together.\"[309]\r\nSometimes in the maps one finds twelve or twenty strips bracketed as\r\nbelonging to one man; sometimes the surveys state that 16 or 20 acres\r\nlie together. But even 10 acres is a big field, quite big enough to\r\nrepay the cost of hedging and ditching. When sufficient strips have\r\nbecome contiguous to form a close of this size one great obstacle to\r\nenclosure has been removed. Unity of cultivation has been added to unity\r\nof ownership. The difficulty that enclosure will probably, though not\r\nnecessarily, mean the exclusion of the other tenants' beasts after\r\nharvest still remains. But an individual tenant will no longer find\r\nenclosure impossible if he can persuade his neighbours to acquiesce in\r\nit. In fact he does sometimes persuade them, and in the midst of fields\r\nwhich are still open one finds here and there blocks which have been\r\nenclosed.\r\n\r\n    [307] _e.g._ _The Commonweal of this Realm of England_, p. 56:\r\n    \"And weare it not that oure grounde lieth in the common fieldes,\r\n    intermingled one with another, I thincke also oure fieldes had\r\n    been inclosed, of a common agreement of all the townshippe,\r\n    longe ere this time.\"\r\n\r\n    [308] See opposite, the map of part of Salford.\r\n\r\n    [309] Merton Documents, No. 5209, Rental of Ibstone (about\r\n    1600): \"Item, Thomas Skott holdeth ix acres as it is estymed\r\n    lieinge together in Tillage.\" \"John ... holdeth 16 acres of\r\n    Lande lieinge together in Redfield.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I.

MAP OF THE MANOR OF WHADBOROUGH IN LEICESTERSHIRE\r\n(1620.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nNor can we doubt that this process of forming strips into blocks took\r\nplace through deliberate action on the part of tenants, though we need\r\nnot assume that the probability of its leading to enclosure was always\r\nforeseen. The amalgamation of the scattered parts of a single holding\r\nhad sufficient advantages to commend it without any further change, and\r\nenclosure may often have been an afterthought. How could this\r\namalgamation come about? It would naturally take place by a process of\r\nexchange[310] between tenants. As we have seen, the tenants were from an\r\nearly date buying and selling, leasing and sub-letting, parts of their\r\nholdings. What could be more reasonable than that in doing so they\r\nshould have regard to the situation of the plots which they acquired,\r\nand so arrange their bargains as gradually to substitute a few larger\r\nblocks for many scattered strips? This hypothesis (for it is only a\r\nhypothesis) receives a certain amount of confirmation from a curious\r\nfact to which attention was called for the first time by Professor\r\nUnwin.[311] It occasionally happens that we find the very tenants who\r\nsell and let part of their holdings are buying and leasing parts of\r\nother holdings from their neighbours. Thus, at Gorleston,[312] in\r\nSuffolk, a customary tenant sublets about half his holding of 12 acres\r\nto as many as eight other persons, and at the same time acquires plots\r\nof land from another eight holdings himself. At Crondal[313] Richard\r\nWysdon adds enormously to his half-virgate by encroachments, and at the\r\nsame time sublets 2-1/2 acres to Hugh Sweyn. Henry Simmond enters on\r\nland belonging to the same Richard Wysdon, and in turn transfers 8 acres\r\nof his holding to Matilda Huthe. What is relevant to the question in\r\nthese transactions is not the mere sub-letting and selling of land.\r\nThat, as we have seen, was common enough. The noticeable thing is that\r\nthe same tenant who surrenders part of his holding acquires part of the\r\nholdings of other people. After the transactions are completed he holds\r\nabout as much land as before, only it is differently arranged. May it\r\nnot be that the desire that it should be differently arranged was one of\r\nthe motives of the double transaction, and that in this way he sought to\r\nsubstitute for his dispersed strips a compacter and more manageable\r\nholding? Is he not like a shareholder who sells out Canadian Pacifics\r\nand invests in Consols, in order to have his property more directly\r\nunder his own eye? At any rate such an explanation would account for the\r\nundoubted fact that in the sixteenth century holdings are much more\r\ncompact than they are in the thirteenth century. But whether it is\r\ncorrect or not the growth towards compactness is a fact, and a fact\r\nwhich makes possible the enclosure of holdings in the open fields.\r\n\r\n    [310] Exchanges are not uncommon, _e.g._ Roxburghe Club,\r\n    _Pembroke Surveys_, Manor of South Brent and Huish: \"Note that\r\n    the same Thomas with leave of the Court has exchanged the said\r\n    acre lying near Appleworth with John Moore, customary tenant of\r\n    the lord, for one acre lyinge in Holmefield.\" Mr. Kolthammer has\r\n    called my attention to a case (Ashford Court Rolls, 1605), in\r\n    which a tenant gives up a number of half acre strips lying\r\n    between the lands of another, and receives in exchange some\r\n    strips of the latter which lie between his own.\r\n\r\n    [311] _Victoria County History_, Suffolk, Social and Economic\r\n    History.\r\n\r\n    [312] _Victoria County History_, Suffolk, Social and Economic\r\n    History.\r\n\r\n    [313] _Crondal Records_ (Baigent), pp. 134, 149, 152, 154-155.\r\n\r\nIt is plain from these and similar instances that there was a\r\nwell-defined movement from the fourteenth century onwards which made for\r\nthe gradual modification or dissolution of the open field system of\r\ncultivation, and that it originated not on the side of the lord or the\r\ngreat farmer, but on the side of the peasants themselves, who tried to\r\novercome the inconvenience of that system by a spontaneous process of\r\nre-allotment, sometimes, but not always, in conjunction with actual\r\nenclosure. On one manor it proceeded by the piecemeal encroachments of\r\nindividuals, on another by the deliberate division of the common meadow\r\nor pasture, on a third by the voluntary exchanging by tenants of their\r\nstrips so as to build up compact holdings, on a fourth by the\r\nredistribution of the arable land. It was a spontaneous movement in the\r\nsense of being initiated by the tenants and not merely forced upon them.\r\nThe economic, as distinct from the legal, arrangements of the village\r\ncommunity were much less rigid than some of the books about it would\r\nsuggest. The open field system of cultivation was, in fact, already in\r\nslow motion in several parts of England, when the impact of the large\r\ngrazier struck it, enormously accelerated the speed of the movement, and\r\ndiverted it on to lines which were new and disastrous to the bulk of the\r\nrural population.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the enclosures, though not overlooked by contemporaries,\r\nhas perhaps hardly received the emphasis which it deserves from modern\r\nwriters. For one thing, a recollection of it explains certain apparent\r\ncontradictions, the difference in the views expressed by different\r\nwriters in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as to the social\r\neffect of enclosures, the disagreement between Mr. Leadam and Professor\r\nGay as to whether enclosing was or was not usually followed by\r\nconversion to pasture, the strange statement of Hales[314] that \"the\r\nchief destruccion of Townes and decaye of houses was before the\r\nbeginning of the reigne of Kynge Henry the Seventh.\" The latter remark\r\ncan hardly have been true of the great and sudden evictions which caused\r\nrioting and depopulation, and evoked the long series of statutes which\r\nbegin in 1489. It may well have been a curt summary of the impression\r\nproduced by a century of gradual consolidation and piecemeal enclosures\r\ncarried out by the smaller cultivators. It would seem, again, to be the\r\ncase that while landlords usually enclosed with the object of putting\r\nsheep where men had been, the tenants of customary holdings enclosed\r\nsimply for the sake of better arable farming, or for the more convenient\r\nemployment of meadow and pasture land. That is why Hales could make\r\nhimself detested by landlords as the chairman of the only effective\r\ncommittee of Somerset's ill-starred Enclosure Commission, and at the\r\nsame time say that certain kinds of enclosure are \"very beneficiall to\r\nthe commonweal.\" That is why Fuller and Moore a century later could damn\r\nenclosure in one sentence and qualify their verdict in the next. That is\r\nwhy Moore's numerous critics could repudiate his aspersions with some\r\nacrimony, and nevertheless admit that \"when townes are in the hands of\r\none or few men ... enclosure doth produce depopulation.\"[315]\r\n\r\n    [314] \"The defence of John Hales agenst certyn sclaundres and\r\n    false reaportes made of hym\" (Appendix to Miss Lamond's\r\n    introduction to _The Commonweal of this Realm of England_, p.\r\n    liii.). Two things make the effect of the fifteenth century\r\n    enclosures obscure. First, the pamphlets on popular grievances\r\n    which begin in the sixteenth century were hardly possible before\r\n    the general use of the printing press. Second, in the sixteenth\r\n    century people appealed to the Tudor government for protection\r\n    because it was strong enough to give it. In the fifteenth\r\n    century there was no Government to preserve order, let alone\r\n    protect the poorer classes. Even if there were, therefore,\r\n    extensive enclosures producing depopulation, we might very well\r\n    hear little of them. But, while confessing ignorance, I think\r\n    Hales' statement compatible with the view expressed above and on\r\n    page 138, note 1, that the fifteenth century was a time when the\r\n    consolidation of holdings was going forward slowly through the\r\n    small speculations of the peasants.\r\n\r\n    [315] _A Vindication of the Considerations concerning Common\r\n    Fields and Enclosures_ (Pseudonismus).\r\n\r\nFor another thing, the prevalence of small enclosures suggests that the\r\nview of those who represent the agriculture of the period as needing a\r\nviolent shock to rouse it from a state of intolerable inefficiency can\r\nonly be accepted with considerable qualification. We know that by the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century in certain counties, notably Kent,\r\nEssex, and Devonshire, the common field system of cultivation was\r\nalready the exception and not the rule. We know, too, that though in\r\nparts of these counties its absence may have been due to differences in\r\nthe original forms of settlement and clearance, it had elsewhere\r\ndisappeared within historical times. We may conjecture that the reason\r\nwhy it decayed sooner in Kent and Essex than elsewhere was the fact that\r\nthe neighbourhood of those counties to London and the sea, and to the\r\ncommercial routes from the Continent, caused the influence of commerce\r\nand of a money economy to be felt there sooner than in the Midlands,\r\nwith the natural result of accelerating economic and agrarian changes,\r\nand that in the examples quoted above we have the same process of\r\nindividualisation in the method of agriculture going on quietly\r\nelsewhere in a way which would sooner or later have brought about a\r\nsimilar result to that which had already occurred in those two\r\nprogressive districts. At any rate these rearrangements suggest a good\r\ndeal of adaptability among the tenants who carried them out, and not the\r\ncondition of organised torpor which some writers profess to find in the\r\nunenclosed village. That communal cultivation was incompatible with\r\nswift change may be granted. Of that fact its survival into almost our\r\nown day is a sufficient proof. That it prevented improvements altogether\r\nmust be denied; and though no doubt to large farmers and impatient\r\nsurveyors the petty operations of the smaller tenants seemed intolerably\r\ndilatory and wasteful, the student who looks at them in an age which has\r\nsome experience of economic revolutions may well doubt whether rapid\r\ntechnical progress cannot be bought too dear, and regret that the\r\ngradual movement towards more rational methods of farming on the part of\r\nthe small man was so soon overtaken by one over which the small man\r\ncould exercise no effective control. Now, as then, land agents shake\r\ngrave heads at the wastefulness of sacrificing the well-ordered dignity\r\nof a great estate to the encouragement of undercapitalised, untidy,\r\nhiggledy-piggledy small holdings, and prove by arithmetic that the\r\nlabourer has more comforts for less work. Now, as then, in those\r\ncountries where the peasant tradition has not died altogether away, the\r\nunreasonable creature prefers starving on land which is his own, though\r\nit be but a tiny patch where he sweats from dawn to dark.\r\n\r\nIf it be objected to the view which we have taken of the slow spread of\r\nenclosure among the peasantry that they were notoriously opposed to\r\nenclosing, we must answer by repeating that there was nothing\r\ninconsistent in approving one kind and detesting another. After all\r\nthere is no curse attached to landmarks, but only to the man who removes\r\nhis neighbour's. Even in an open field village no one had a\r\nconscientious objection to fences in general; it all depended on where\r\nthe fences were put. The object of enclosure was to shut in, or to shut\r\nout, or to do both. The villagers were not unwilling that an agreement\r\nshould be reached whereby each man should shut his own beasts in a close\r\nof pasture, and shut out the beasts of other people from his arable\r\nafter harvest. On the contrary, it was sometimes a grievance[316] that\r\nenclosure was not allowed. What they objected to was that one man should\r\nexclude others without compensation from rights of pasture or from their\r\narable holdings. Moreover, provided that enclosure took place by\r\nconsent, the advantages of it were overwhelming. When the superior[317]\r\nvalue of enclosed over unenclosed land was so marked that the former was\r\nsometimes assessed to subsidies at a higher rate than the latter, a man\r\nwho, like many of our tenants, had money to spend on timber, would\r\nnaturally wish to enclose. The growth of pasture farming by large\r\ngraziers turned the minds of the smaller tenants in the direction of\r\nenclosing for themselves, because this, paradoxical though it may seem\r\nwhen the outcry against enclosure is remembered, was the most obvious\r\nway in which they could protect themselves. The explanation is that the\r\nsystem of open field cultivation and of common pasturage made it\r\npeculiarly easy for one large shareholder to ruin the rest by letting\r\nhis cattle stray at large over the common, and even by encroachments on\r\nhis neighbour's strips. Its underlying principle had been the\r\napportionment of rights on a basis which was settled by the custom of\r\nthe manor, as opposed to the acquisition by individuals for themselves\r\nof such rights as they could obtain by economic power, or by the\r\naccumulation of capital. This was the meaning of the strict allotment of\r\ngrazing privileges by the establishment of a stint which each tenant, or\r\nrather each tenement, was not to exceed. The limitation to the capital\r\nwhich a man could acquire in the shape of stock--cattle and sheep--was\r\npracticable as long as that capital was small. When it became large, as\r\nin the sixteenth century it did, it was too powerful to be dammed up by\r\nthe rules as to cultivation enforced in the manorial court, and the\r\noutward sign of this was the failure of the latter to prevent the\r\n\"overcharging\" both of the common waste, and of the common pasture\r\nformed by the field after harvest, with the beasts of the large grazier.\r\nHence in some places the enclosing of pasture or arable was used by the\r\ntenants as a way of protecting themselves: at Mudford the tenants, at\r\nNewham and Tughall the surveyor in the interests of the tenants, at\r\nSouthampton the Leet jury, were anxious[318] for enclosing, in order\r\nthat the weak barriers which the custom of the manor offered to the\r\nfarmers' or to neighbouring villagers' depredations might be\r\nsupplemented by a strong quickset hedge. What damaged the smaller\r\ntenants, and produced the popular revolts against enclosure, was not\r\nmerely enclosing, but enclosing accompanied either by eviction and\r\nconversion to pasture, or by the monopolising of common rights. When\r\nsome of the tenants became large capitalists, what the rest lost by\r\nsurrendering common rights might be more than compensated by the\r\nsecurity which they thus obtained of grazing their own beasts\r\nundisturbed on a smaller area.\r\n\r\n    [316] _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i., Survey of\r\n    Whitford: \"I woulde wish that the same [the common] were divided\r\n    among the tenants yielding some small rente ... the poore men\r\n    with dyligence and labour woulde soon convert yt to amendement,\r\n    and alter the nature thereof, but the ritche men will not\r\n    consent to that, for yt is as good to them as theire several\r\n    grounde or pasture. The poore are not able to store yt with\r\n    cattle, nor to use the commodytie as they might do if welth\r\n    woulde serve them. But the rytche do consume their own parts and\r\n    their neighbouris also: and that is the cause they will not\r\n    consent to the enclosure and partition thereof.\"\r\n\r\n    [317] There is interesting documentary proof of the statements\r\n    of surveyors. Warwickshire MSS. Quarter Sessions Records,\r\n    Michaelmas, 1636: \"Fforasmuche as this Courte is informed that\r\n    Overhinton (?) in this countie consists of 30 yardlands, of\r\n    which 22 are enclosed and 8 yardlands thereof residue in the\r\n    possession of Thomas [surname illegible] do lie in the common\r\n    fields, and whereas the same 8 yardlands lyinge in the comon\r\n    fields have been heretofore rated equally and proportionablie in\r\n    all levies with thother yardlands, the said 22 yard of inclosed\r\n    land being worth xx [pounds], for every yardland and the seid\r\n    other 8 yardlands being worth but after the rate of x the\r\n    yardland, it is ordered that the said 8 yardlands shall from\r\n    henceforth pay in all levies but after the rate of x pounds for\r\n    every yardland and the said 22 yardlands after the rate of xx\r\n    pounds for every yardland, unless the owners of the said 22\r\n    yardlands shall att the next sessions uppon convenient notice\r\n    hereof to them given shewe cause to the contrarie.\" The Justices\r\n    do not understand the taxation of unimproved land.\r\n\r\n    [318] See _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i., for Mudford;\r\n    for Newham and Tughall, _Northumberland County History_, vol.\r\n    i.; for Southampton, Hearnshaw, _Court Leet Records of\r\n    Southampton_.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, though voluntary enclosing by the peasants was partly\r\na symptom of the overshadowing of small property by large, it was much\r\nmore than this, and was due partly to a change in their methods of\r\nagriculture, and partly, perhaps, to a genuine progress in the technique\r\nof cultivation. This is indicated by the enthusiasm of the expert\r\nopinion of the period for \"several\" holdings, and by the qualified\r\npraise of discriminating critics like Hales.[319] As we have seen\r\nabove, there were parts of England--for example, \"the sweet country of\r\nTandeane,\" described by Norden--where cultivation was quite intensive in\r\ncharacter, and intensive cultivation naturally gave an impetus to the\r\nindividualising of arable holdings. Again, the advantage to the cattle\r\nbreeder of \"several closes and pastures to put his cattle in, the which\r\nwould be well quicksetted, hedged, and ditched,\"[320] was a commonplace.\r\nIt has been already pointed out that on many manors of Southern and\r\nEastern England the customary tenants were sheep farmers on a\r\nconsiderable scale. The adjustment of common rights must always have\r\ninvolved some difficulty: the fixing of so many head of beasts to each\r\ntenement was obviously a rough and ready arrangement based on the idea\r\nthat the holding in the arable fields was the backbone of a man's\r\nsubstance, and that therefore it might properly be taken as a standard\r\nby which his rights of pasture and common could fairly be measured. The\r\nproblems which arose could be imagined, even if they were not described\r\nfor us at some length: \"Where fields lie open and the land is used in\r\ncommon, he that is rich and fully stocked (up to the limit allowed)\r\neateth with his cattle not his own part only, but also his neighbour's\r\nwho is poor and out of stock. Besides that, it is an ordinary practice\r\nwith unconscionable people to keep above their just proportion ... those\r\nwho have consciences large enough to do it will lengthen their ropes, or\r\nstake them down so that their horses may reach into other men's\r\nlots.\"[321] As long as the great bulk of the customary tenants relied\r\nfor a livelihood mainly on the subsistence farming of the arable land,\r\nthese practical difficulties were probably not felt very keenly, because\r\nthe comparatively few beasts which were kept could pick up a living\r\nwithout overcrowding each other. But when the raising of stock became\r\nalmost as important as the cultivation of arable, the demand for more\r\npasture and for better pasture grew enormously, and in the face of the\r\ncompetition for it the strict maintenance of the customary stint became\r\nmore difficult. On manors where 150 or 200 sheep were kept by almost\r\nevery tenant the motive either to enclose surreptitiously and in\r\ndefiance of the custom of the manor, or to divide and enclose meadow and\r\npasture by agreement, must have been extremely strong. Ought we not to\r\nask why the open field system survived so long, rather than why it\r\npartially disappeared in the sixteenth century?\r\n\r\n    [319] _The Commonweal of this Realm of England_, p. 49: \"I meane\r\n    not all inclosures, nor yet all commons, but only of such\r\n    inclosures as turneth commonly arable lands into pastures; and\r\n    violent inclosures, without recompence of them that have right\r\n    to comen therein; for if land weare severallie inclosed, to the\r\n    intent to continue husbandrie thereon, and everie man, that had\r\n    Right to Common, had for his portion a pece of the same to\r\n    himselfe enclosed, I thincke no harme but rather good should\r\n    come thereof, yf everie man did agre theirto.\"\r\n\r\n    [320] Fitzherbert, _Book of Husbandry_.\r\n\r\n    [321] Pseudonismus, 1654, _Considerations concerning Common\r\n    Fields and Enclosures_.\r\n\r\nWe may now summarise the argument of this part of our work. The manor,\r\nas we see it from the middle of the fourteenth century onwards, is not\r\nthe rigid, motionless organisation which it is sometimes represented as\r\nbeing. Though it is governed by custom, custom leaves room for the\r\ngrowth of commercial relationships on the extending fringe of new land\r\nover which the village spreads; for the withdrawal by the villagers of\r\npart of their holdings from the common scheme of open field husbandry,\r\nthe division of meadows and pastures, the exchanging of strips, the\r\nformation of closes like those represented in the map on the opposite\r\npage, which a man can use as he pleases and over which the customary\r\nroutine of agriculture has no authority. This side of the enclosing\r\nmovement, more properly described as redivision and reallotment than as\r\nenclosure, develops earliest in those parts of the country which, owing\r\nto their geographical position, are particularly exposed to the\r\ndissolving forces of trade and of a money economy. But with the\r\nimprovement in the condition of the peasantry and the growth of pasture\r\nfarming it spreads far afield, and by the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, quite apart from the large changes introduced by lords of\r\nmanors and capitalist farmers, it has effected a considerable alteration\r\nin the methods of agriculture even of the more stationary inland\r\ncounties. Such piecemeal alterations are a gradual process; they are not\r\nregarded unfavourably by the peasantry; and a balance between their\r\ntentative individualism and the rule of communal custom is preserved by\r\nthe action of the manorial court. They are to be carefully\r\ndistinguished from the sweeping innovations of the sixteenth century,\r\nwhich alone deserve the name of an Agrarian Revolution. But they are\r\nclosely connected with that revolution. For by making a breach in the\r\nwalls of custom they bring us to the edge of two great problems, the\r\ngrowth of competitive rents, and the formation of large pasture farms\r\nout of the holdings of evicted tenants.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken at length of the prosperity of the peasants, because it\r\nis necessary to appreciate it in order to sympathise with the point of\r\nview from which they and their contemporaries regarded the agrarian\r\nproblem. But evil days are coming upon the rural middle classes. Indeed\r\nthey have already come. There is by this time much anger against\r\ndepopulating landlords, much talk of the good customs of Henry VII.,\r\nmuch murmuring lest men be brought to that slavery the Frenchman be in.\r\nWe must leave the light and follow them into the shadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSITION TO CAPITALIST AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The earth is thine, O Lord, and all that is contained therein;\r\n     notwithstanding thou hast given the possession thereof to the\r\n     children of men, to pass over the time of their short\r\n     pilgrimage in this vale of misery.

S., Crowley, _The Way to\r\n     Wealth_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE NEW RURAL ECONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) _Motives and Causes_\r\n\r\nA common view of social development regards it as the outcome of\r\nirresistible causes working towards results which can be neither\r\nhastened nor averted, and treats the fact that events have followed a\r\ncertain course as in itself an indication that no other course was\r\npossible. Whatever is has always been implicit in the past; the\r\nestablished fact rules by the divine right of being the only possible\r\ndynasty, and no scope is left for pretenders to contest or acts of\r\nsettlement to alter its legitimate title. It is not surprising that such\r\na theory should be peculiarly popular in interpreting economic history.\r\nOn their frontiers even the most different forms of social organisation\r\nshade into one another. Each generation naturally sees in a strong light\r\nthose regions of the past which reproduce the features with which it is\r\nfamiliar, and overlooks the existence of wide Hinterlands whose general\r\nfeatures are quite different. Since important classes, like important\r\nindividuals, find it difficult to believe in the truthfulness of any\r\npicture where they do not occupy the greater part of the canvas, they\r\ninsensibly encourage a conventional interpretation of history, which\r\nlends an air of respectable antiquity to the legal and economic\r\narrangements which favour them and which they favour, by treating such\r\narrangements as an essential characteristic of civilisation itself. In\r\nreality, however, it is only by dragging into prominence the forces\r\nwhich have triumphed, and thrusting into the background those which they\r\nhave swallowed up, that an appearance of inevitableness is given to\r\nexisting institutions, which satisfies the desire to see them as links\r\nin an orderly chain of unavoidable sequences. Useful as the conception\r\nof a continuous development is, it can easily be carried too far. It is\r\ncarried too far when it causes us to forget that a small alteration in\r\nthe lie of the land might have caused the stream to take quite a\r\ndifferent channel, and that the smoothly flowing waters of the plain are\r\nthe outcome of a series of crises in the higher regions, where the spur\r\nof a mountain or a cleft in the rocks might easily have diverted their\r\ncourse into other directions. If we must talk of social evolution, we\r\nought to remember that it takes place through the action of human\r\nbeings, that such action is constantly violent, or merely short-sighted,\r\nor deliberately selfish, and that a form of social organisation which\r\nappears to us now to be inevitable, once hung in the balance as one of\r\nseveral competing possibilities.\r\n\r\nCertainly the possibility that economic changes should have followed a\r\nquite different line from that which they actually have can hardly fail\r\nto strike the student of agrarian history. The facts, as we read them,\r\ndo not lend unqualified support to the idea that the growth, at the\r\nexpense of the little landholders, of great estates cultivated by hired\r\nlabour was the inevitable result of irresistible forces, or that the new\r\nagricultural régime was a necessity on account of the sluggishness of\r\nthe old. To an observer of agrarian conditions living about the year\r\n1500, who looked back over the conditions of the last century, all the\r\npossibilities must have seemed to point in the direction of a continuous\r\nimprovement in the condition of the peasantry. It is evident that the\r\ngrowth of prosperity among the small cultivators was leading from the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century to the gradual consolidation of\r\nholdings, to keen competition for the use of land, and to increasing\r\nindividualism in the methods of agriculture. Though the movement caused\r\na diminution in the number of landholders, the diminution was very\r\ngradual. It was not the result of a sudden revolution affecting large\r\nnumbers of tenants simultaneously; and even those who regarded enclosing\r\nwith hostility were favourable to the process of gradual redistribution,\r\nwhich did not violate vested interests or cause any sensational\r\ndisturbance. The appearance of the country would have changed, and the\r\nmethods of cultivation would have improved. But there would have been no\r\ngreat cause at work to displace the peasantry from the soil, with the\r\nrapidity which entailed hardship, until a much later period than we are\r\nnow considering. Obviously, however, it was not these slow internal\r\nchanges in the manorial organisation which impressed observers. On the\r\ncontrary, though they are noticed by the writer who took a scientific\r\ninterest in agricultural questions, they are hardly mentioned by the\r\nmajority of commentators on the life of the period, who were interested\r\nnot in the technique of agriculture but in the social results of\r\nchanging methods. What aroused their alarm and produced rioting and\r\nlegislation was, as every one knows, a movement the distinctive feature\r\nof which was that it was initiated by lords of manors and great farmers,\r\n\"the Graziers, the rich buchars, the men of law, the merchants, the\r\ngentlemen, the Knights, the Lords,\"[322] in short by the wealthiest and\r\nmost powerful classes, and that it was carried out frequently against\r\nthe will of the tenants, and in such a way as to prejudice their\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n    [322] Crowley, _The Way to Wealth_ (E. E. T. S.).\r\n\r\nAs the small capitalist prepared the way for the great, the two\r\nmovements were connected, and the simultaneous development of both of\r\nthem explains the rather puzzling mixture of approval and criticism\r\nwhich is to be found in the comments of observers upon enclosing. But\r\ntheir economic and social results were very different. No doubt the\r\nincipient movement in the direction of reorganising national life on the\r\nbasis of industry involved a breach with the customary methods of\r\nagriculture, which must in any case have caused a certain degree of\r\ndislocation. The development of the textile manufactures, which for two\r\ncenturies were the chief source of English wealth, could not have taken\r\nplace without the production of cheap supplies of raw material, and the\r\ngrowth of the towns was dependent on the saving of labour from\r\nagriculture. But in such changes the element of time--the speed at which\r\nthe transition takes place--is all important, because upon it depends\r\nthe feasibility of social readjustments to meet the new situation. The\r\nslow breaking up of the open field system, though it changed the\r\nmethods of cultivation, might quite conceivably have effected only such\r\na gradual diminution in the number of the small farmers, as to make the\r\nabsorption into industry of those displaced comparatively easy. In so\r\nfar as the changes of the sixteenth century were a social revolution,\r\nand not merely a gradual development, this revolution was the result not\r\nonly of technical advances, but of the concentration of landed property\r\nand the development of new relationships between landlord and tenant. It\r\nis to the second of the two movements that we must now turn.\r\n\r\nThe new agrarian arrangements which we shall have to consider are called\r\nby the name of enclosure, and we will discuss later what exactly\r\nenclosure means in this connection. But there are enclosures and\r\nenclosures, and we shall do well to begin by drawing some distinctions.\r\nIn the first place, then, the enclosing movement that will occupy us in\r\nthis chapter has very little resemblance to the enclosure which we have\r\nconsidered in the last. It is carried out by great men, not by small. It\r\nproceeds wholesale, not piecemeal. It does not consist in many little\r\ncultivators rearranging their holdings by purchase, or sale, or\r\nagreement, but in one great proprietor or his agent consolidating small\r\nholdings into great estates. The new arrangements are imposed rapidly\r\nand with a high hand from without. They do not arise gradually from\r\nwithin through the spontaneous development of the peasants' needs and\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nAgain, the new movement bears very little resemblance to the\r\nrearrangements introduced by lords of manors, which, from an early date,\r\nhave gone by the name of enclosing. Such rearrangements have not been\r\nfew. People have talked about enclosing long before they have begun to\r\nlament enclosures. Not to mention the encroachments on the waste\r\nevidenced by the Statute of Merton, one finds the word \"enclosure\" used\r\nin the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries to describe a variety of\r\nagreements made between lords whose lands were contiguous, or between\r\nlords and their free tenants, by which, instead of the parties concerned\r\nusing a given area in common as their pasture, each surrenders his right\r\nof access to part of it, and obtains in return the right to use another\r\npart in severalty. The Abbot of Malmesbury[323] and the men of\r\nNiwentone come to an arrangement with Walter of Asselegge and the men of\r\nthat village, whereby the monastery agrees to follow the customary\r\nroutine in cultivating the land lying between Niwentone and Asselegge,\r\nand not to common on the marsh at Cheggeberge, getting in return\r\nexclusive rights of pasture over another marsh, and over the east field\r\nof Niwentone. The Abbot and Monastery of St. Peter's[324] of Gloucester\r\nmake an agreement with Lord Thomas Berkeley whereby the former are \"to\r\nhave and hold in severalty and enclose and approve at their will\"\r\ncertain lands lying in Southfield \"so that the said Thomas and his free\r\ntenants may not ... claim or demand common, but be excluded from it for\r\never,\" and in return covenant that the latter may \"enclose and approve\r\ntheir lands in all parts of the summit of the Pike of Coveleigh.\"\r\nSimilar arrangements are made between the Abbot of Glastonbury[325] and\r\na neighbouring landowner, between the Abbot of Cerne[326] and Robert of\r\nBloxworth, and between the City of Coventry[327] and the master and\r\nbrethren of the Trinity Gild of that town.\r\n\r\n    [323] _Registrum Malmesburiense_, vol. ii. pp. 220-?221: \"Quod\r\n    ... dictus abbas de Malmesburia non debet de cetero colere\r\n    terram de Niwentone ... nisi antiquitus consueverat coli. Et\r\n    quod dictus Walterus de Asselegge habebit mariscum suum de\r\n    Cheggeberge quietum a communia hominum de Niwentone. Dicti vero\r\n    abbas et conventus Malmesburia habebunt mariscum suum iacentem\r\n    ex Orientali parte stratæ publicæ quæ vocatur Fos quietum et\r\n    exceptum a communia hominum de Asselegge. Habebunt etiam ...\r\n    campum Australem in Niwentone quietum et exceptum a communia\r\n    hominum de Asselegge. Omnes vero aliæ terræ ad dictas villas\r\n    pertinentes ... erunt in pastura communi.\"\r\n\r\n    [324] _Historia et Cartularium Monasterii Gloucestriæ_, i.\r\n    147-?149.\r\n\r\n    [325] Hoare, _History of Wiltshire_, Hundred of South Domerham.\r\n\r\n    [326] _Hist. MSS. Com._, Cd. 5567 (Report on the MSS. of Lord\r\n    Middleton), pp. 61?-62. This agreement was made in 1231.\r\n\r\n    [327] _Coventry Leet Book_ (edited by Mary Dormer Harris).\r\n\r\nWhether it is a chance that such agreements seem to occur with special\r\nfrequency in the records of religious houses we cannot say. It is\r\npossible that the perpetual character of a corporation made exclusive\r\nenjoyment at once more desirable and more feasible; a great abbey, like\r\nSt. Peter's of Gloucester, could pursue a continuous and far-sighted\r\npolicy, and wait more than a generation to see the results of its\r\nexperiments. Nor is it possible to understand the motives for such\r\narrangements without information as to local conditions which is not\r\neasily obtainable. Sometimes the object was simply to protect land used\r\nfor agriculture against the depredations caused by the game of a hunting\r\nlandlord. Sometimes it would seem to have been to allow of a variation\r\nin the methods of agriculture, for example the sowing of a piece of land\r\nwhich could not be sown as long as several persons had right of pasture\r\nover it. Occasionally it was simply to realise an obvious convenience\r\ndictated by the lie of the land, each party gaining more by the\r\nexclusive use of pasture lying near to him, than he would lose by\r\nsurrendering rights of common over that part which lay at a distance.\r\nTwo points, however, are worth noticing. The first is the use of the\r\nword \"enclosure.\" Arrangements which go by the name \"enclosure\" are made\r\nat a very early date by the manorial authorities, and the latter would\r\nhave been very much surprised to be told that they were inaugurating an\r\nagrarian revolution. The second is the character of these enclosures.\r\nThey are in every way different from those which produced discontent in\r\nthe sixteenth century. Though they affected the routine of cultivation\r\nthey did not imply any abandonment of arable farming. Since they were\r\ncarried out mainly by an exchange of rights they did not prejudice the\r\ntenants. Further, the disputes of which they were sometimes the result\r\nwere not disputes between the lord of a manor and his tenantry, but\r\nbetween the lord and tenants of one manor and the lord and tenants of\r\nanother, the ground of the disagreement being the difficulty of\r\nadjusting rights of common over the debatable land which must often have\r\nlain between two manors, and the division of interests being, as it\r\nwere, a vertical, not a horizontal, division. In fact, these early\r\nexamples of enclosure throw light on the later movement only by way of\r\ncontrast. What we meet in our period is not isolated innovations of this\r\ncharacter, but a general movement spreading across England from\r\nBerkshire in the South to Norfolk and Lincoln in the North-East, and\r\naffecting especially the corn-growing counties of the Midlands, a\r\nmovement which meant a great extension of pasture-farming, a violent\r\ncollision of interests between the manorial authorities and the\r\npeasantry, and a considerable displacement of population. Clearly some\r\nnew and powerful causes must have been at work to account for it.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the movement which goes by the name of enclosing in\r\nthe sixteenth century has little similarity with the changes which\r\nproceeded under the same name from about 1700 to 1850, and which went on\r\nmost swiftly in the reign of George III. It differs from them in method.\r\nIn the eighteenth century Parliament is supreme. It is simply a\r\ncommittee of landlords and their hangers-on, and it makes Private Bill\r\nlegislation a very easy method of getting enclosure carried out. In our\r\nperiod the Government, for reasons to be discussed later, sets its face\r\nagainst most kinds of enclosing, and such enclosures as are made are\r\nmade in defiance of the law. It differs from them in motive. We must not\r\nprejudge the question whether the enclosures of our period were made\r\nmainly for pasture or for arable. But leaving this question on one side,\r\nwe can point to certain broad contrasts. The ostensible motive of the\r\neighteenth century enclosures is to improve the productive capacity of\r\nthe land by spending capital upon it. This is the reason alleged when\r\nPrivate Bills are being promoted, and this is the aspect of the movement\r\nwhich causes it to be eulogised by the agricultural experts. Of course\r\nlandlords were not philanthropists. As Mr. and Mrs. Hammond[328] have\r\ndemonstrated, there were often very sordid motives behind their\r\nresounding platitudes on the advantage of throwing commons and small\r\nholdings into large compact estates, and, even when these were not too\r\nconspicuous, the interests of the smaller landholders were sometimes\r\ntreated with the most outrageous injustice. Still the general nature of\r\nthe movement was clearly in the direction of bringing under better\r\ncultivation land which had hitherto not been used to its full economic\r\ncapacity. The price of foodstuffs after 1750 rose enormously, and the\r\nrise in prices offered a golden harvest to any one who would prepare\r\nland for producing larger supplies. The landlords of the eighteenth\r\ncentury did not merely enclose. They improved as well. Part of their\r\nincreased rent rolls was interest on capital which they had invested for\r\nthe purpose. Now in the sixteenth century there is very little trace of\r\nany movement of this kind. What improving is done, is done by the\r\npeasants themselves. There is no sign of the great proprietors making\r\nlarge capital outlays in order to render their estates more productive,\r\nexcept in the way of the trifling expenditure entailed by fencing,\r\nhedging, and ditching. They are by no means pioneers of agricultural\r\nprogress. Enclosing is profitable to them not because it enables them to\r\nconvert barren heaths into smiling corn-fields in the manner described\r\nby Arthur Young, but because it enables them to use the land as they\r\nplease, to let it down to pasture when the price of wool is high, to\r\nemploy few labourers on it instead of many, and, possibly, to add to\r\ntheir own estates part of their neighbours' holdings. They do not bring\r\nunder cultivation land which would otherwise lie waste. On the contrary,\r\nvery often they turn into a waste land which would otherwise be under\r\ncultivation. Whether the picture which represents the eighteenth century\r\nenclosures as the effort of an energetic and public-spirited class to\r\novercome old-fashioned prejudices by applying the resources of science\r\nto agriculture is veracious or not, we need not now inquire. As far as\r\nthe century and a half from 1485 is concerned it is altogether out of\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n    [328] In their book, _The Village Labourer from_ 1760 to 1832.\r\n\r\nThe changes which we are about to describe have at once a social and an\r\neconomic reference. The former is the aspect which receives most\r\nattention from contemporaries. They lament the decay of the peasantry,\r\nthe embittered relations between classes, the distress and discontent\r\ncaused by the new agrarian régime. They are usually not much concerned\r\nwith the economics of the situation. Economic issues are not yet\r\nseparated from questions of personal and public morality. To find subtle\r\nreasons why it is unavoidable that a large number of persons should be\r\nimpoverished seems to them very like condoning a crime. Some excuses\r\nonly aggravate the offence, and if men are cursed with a neighbour who\r\ninsists on fulfilling economic laws by raising prices or taking usury,\r\nthey are less likely to discuss his conclusions than first to present\r\nhim for breaking the statutes and then to break his head for his bad\r\nprinciples. So they judge the dominant movement by its fruits, and its\r\nfruits seem very evil. But to us the economic problem is the primary\r\none. The occurrence of rapid changes in the structure of an old and\r\nstable society implies either some radical revolution in the basis of\r\neconomic life, or some great change in men's conception of social\r\nexpediency, or, what is most likely, an economic and a spiritual change\r\noccurring together. To understand its effect we must understand the sort\r\nof economic environment from which it springs.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, the age of the Tudors is a commercial age, and\r\nit becomes more commercial as the century goes on. No doubt it is only\r\nof certain classes and in certain relations of life that such a\r\nstatement is true. The permanence of economic arrangements, which makes\r\nFroude declare that at the end of the fifteenth century the model of the\r\nupper classes was still the chivalry of the Arthurian legends, is seen\r\nstill more strikingly among the artisans and peasants, and it is only\r\nvery slowly and painfully that they are drawn into the net woven by the\r\ngrowth of capitalist trade. But it is with the classes who respond to\r\nthe new movement that the power of the future, though not its graces,\r\nlies, and it is through the widening of the influence of commerce and\r\ncommercial transactions that the economic developments most typical of\r\nour period take place. The age is a commercial one in the sense that\r\nmuch attention is given by Governments from the reign of Henry VII.\r\nonwards to fostering the conditions which promote trade and industry.\r\nThis is not the place to discuss the meaning of Mercantilism or the\r\ntruth of Bacon's[329] epigram that Henry VII. \"bowed the ancient policy\r\nof this State from consideration of plenty to consideration of power.\"\r\nThough in the reign of Henry VIII. the State is almost a religion, one\r\ncan easily exaggerate the influence of its interference even in that\r\nmuch governed age. Nevertheless no one who looks at the Statutes, or the\r\nActs of the Privy Council, or the Domestic State Papers for the reigns\r\nof Henry VII., Henry VIII., and Elizabeth, can fail to realise that much\r\nof the time of Governments is occupied with devising measures which are\r\nintended to hasten industrial and commercial development. There is a\r\nsettled habit of mind with regard to these matters which is quite\r\nconscious of its ends, though its means may often be ill-chosen. Every\r\none is agreed that the encouragement of trade is the duty of the\r\nPrince.[330] There is a real popular demand for the intervention of the\r\nauthorities, and they respond to it readily enough.\r\n\r\n    [329] Bacon, _History of King Henry VII._\r\n\r\n    [330] See _e.g._ Starkey's _England in the Reign of King Henry\r\n    VIII._, p. 173 (E. E. T. S.): \"Ye, and though our cloth, at the\r\n    fyrst begynnyng, wold not be so gud peradventure, as hyt ys made\r\n    in other partys, yet, in processe of tyme, I cannot see why, but\r\n    that our men, by dylygence, myght attayne therto ryght wel;\r\n    specially yf the Prince wold study thereto, in whose powar hyt\r\n    lyeth chefely such thyngys to helpe.\" Also _The Commonweal of\r\n    this Realm of England_ (Lamond), and Pauli, _Drei\r\n    Denkschriften_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe age is a commercial one in the more fundamental sense that large\r\neconomic changes are initiated by classes and individuals. Foreign trade\r\ngrows enormously in the early years of Henry VIII., though certain\r\nbranches of it suffer a temporary set back at the end of the reign.[331]\r\nThe use of money, of which during the first quarter of the century there\r\nwas a shortage, begins in the middle of it to spread throughout all\r\nclasses. The industry which for the next three centuries is to be the\r\nchief manufacture of England becomes firmly established. Under the\r\ninfluence of widening markets, trade separates from trade.[332] Within\r\nsingle industries there is an increasing subdivision of labour; many\r\nlinks intervene between the group supplying the raw material and the\r\ngroup which hands the finished article to the consumer; a special class\r\nof capitalist entrepreneurs[333] appears to hold the various stages of\r\nproduction together, to organise supplies, and to find markets. Side by\r\nside with the development of manufacturing industry goes a development\r\nin the organisation of finance. In the woollen industry men buy and sell\r\non credit. In tin-mining[334] and coal-mining[335] they sink shafts with\r\nborrowed capital. The first joint-stock[336] companies are established\r\nin the middle of the century with capitals of from £5000 to £20,000.\r\nThere is a regular money market in London, there are bill brokers,\r\narbitrage dealings between it and the Continent, adventurers who take\r\nadvantage of the increasing fluidity of capital to speculate on the\r\ndifference in the rates at which it can be borrowed in the Low Countries\r\nand in England. By the end of the century London has partially ousted\r\nAntwerp as the financial capital of Europe.[337]\r\n\r\n    [331] Schanz, _Englische Handelspolitik gegen Ende der\r\n    Mittelalters_, Band II., \"Zoll und Handelstatistik,\" pp. 1?-156.\r\n\r\n    [332] Unwin, _Industrial Organisation in the Sixteenth and\r\n    Seventeenth Centuries_.\r\n\r\n    [333] See _e.g._ the account of the East Anglian woollen\r\n    industry in the _Victoria County History_, Suffolk (Unwin's\r\n    article on \"Social and Economic History\").\r\n\r\n    [334] G.R.

Scott, _Joint-Stock Companies to 1720_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n    [337] For a description of \"The Exchange and What It is,\" see T.\r\n    Wilson, _Discourse upon Usurie_ (1584): his remark, \"The second\r\n    kind of bill ... may be called sicke and dry exchange, and is\r\n    practised where one doth borrowe money abroad ... not meaning to\r\n    make any real payment abroad, but compoundeth with the exchange\r\n    to have it returned again,\" illustrates what is said above. See\r\n    also Camden Society, _Dialogue or Confabulation of Two\r\n    Travellers_ (1580): \"The said Hans had provided £10,000 for the\r\n    Prince of Condy upon five in the 100 at interest, and if I would\r\n    have the like he would help me unto it. Then I ... pondered what\r\n    benefit it would be to me to let it out again at ten in the\r\n    hundred to some nobleman in England.\" Down to about 1560 at any\r\n    rate the English Government was constantly in the hands of\r\n    foreign capitalists. See Gairdner, _L. and P. Henry VIII._, and\r\n    Burgon's _Life of Gresham_.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the social arrangements of England are such as to\r\nmake it certain that this increasing activity will react almost\r\nimmediately on agriculture and on agrarian relationships. There have\r\nbeen countries where a sharp line has been drawn between trade and\r\nagriculture, where the landowner could not engage in trade without\r\ndegrading himself, where the tradesman could not buy up the noble's\r\nland.[338] But this has never been the case in England. In that\r\nprecocious island the Lombards had hardly settled in Lombard Street,\r\nwhen Mr. Pole's daughters discovered that the fine shades flourished\r\ntheir finest in country air, and there was a market for heiresses among\r\nthe English aristocracy long before Columbus had revealed to Europe the\r\nEldorado of the New World. From a very early date the successful\r\nmerchant has bought dignity and social consideration by investing his\r\nsavings in an estate. The impecunious gentleman has restored the falling\r\nfortunes of his house by commercial speculations, of which marriage into\r\na merchant family, if not the least speculative, is not the least\r\nprofitable. At the beginning of the sixteenth century both movements\r\nwere going on simultaneously with a rapidity which was before unknown,\r\nand which must be explained as the consequence of the great growth of\r\nall forms of commercial activity. The rise of great incomes drawn from\r\ntrade had brought into existence a new order of business men whose\r\nenterprise was not confined to the seaport and privileged town, but\r\nflowed over into the purchase of landed estates, even before the\r\nsecularisation of monastic endowments made land speculation the mania of\r\na whole generation. Great nobles plunged into commerce, were granted\r\nspecial trading privileges, and intermarried with the rising\r\nmiddle-class families who were often better off than themselves. In all\r\nages wealth allies itself with wealth, and power with power. As soon as\r\nthe appearance of rich merchant families creates a fresh and powerful\r\ninterest in society, the old social system and the new[339] coalesce,\r\nand each learns from the other--the merchant how to make a display as a\r\nlanded proprietor and a Justice of the Peace, the old-fashioned landlord\r\nhow to cut down expenses and squeeze the utmost farthing out of his\r\nproperty in the best City manner. Even if the political and economic\r\nenvironment had remained unchanged, the mere formation of commercial\r\ncapital and of a moneyed class could hardly have failed to work a slow\r\nrevolution in agrarian relationships.\r\n\r\n    [338] _e.g._ Prussia before 1807.\r\n\r\n    [339] For examples see A. Abram, _Social England in the\r\n    Fifteenth Century_, especially Part II., chap, ii., \"The Rise of\r\n    the Middle Class,\" and Plummer's _Fortescue_, p. 17. In the\r\n    _Cely Papers_ (Camden Society), p. 153, a correspondent of\r\n    George Cely writes, \"yowre sallys made withyn lesse than thys\r\n    yere amountes above £2000 sterling.\"\r\n\r\nBut the environment did not remain unchanged; and as a consequence, in\r\neconomic affairs as in religion, the new order came, not gradually, but\r\nswiftly and with violence, sapping ancient loyalties, confronting with\r\ninsoluble problems simple men who desired only to plough the land like\r\ntheir fathers, holding out to the privileged orders that prospect of\r\nsuddenly increasing their wealth which is the most awful temptation from\r\nwhich any class can pray--if it will pray--to be delivered. On the side\r\nof politics a powerful motive for a change in the relations between\r\nlandlords and tenants was supplied by the Tudor peace. In the turbulent\r\ndays of the fifteenth century land had still a military and social\r\nsignificance apart from its economic value; lords had ridden out at the\r\nhead of their retainers to convince a bad neighbour with bows and bills;\r\nand a numerous tenantry had been more important than a high pecuniary\r\nreturn from the soil.[340] The Tudor discipline, with its stern\r\nprohibition of livery and maintenance, its administrative jurisdictions\r\nand tireless bureaucracy, had put down private warfare with a heavy\r\nhand, and, by drawing the teeth of feudalism, had made the command of\r\nmoney more important than the command of men. It is easy to underrate\r\nthe significance of this change, yet it is in a sense more fundamental\r\nthan any other; for it marks the transition from the mediæval conception\r\nof land as the basis of political functions and obligations to the\r\nmodern view of it as an income-yielding investment. Landholding tends,\r\nin short, to become commercialised. The meaning of this movement is best\r\nunderstood if one compares with the South and Midlands those parts of\r\nEngland where to the very end of the sixteenth century the older\r\nconditions survived. The surveys of many Northumbrian[341] manors reveal\r\nthroughout this period of rapid agrarian changes the continuance of a\r\nvery primitive condition of things. The holdings of the customary\r\ntenants are often almost rigidly equal; there is hardly any change in\r\ntheir numbers; son succeeds father, and grandson succeeds son, with only\r\nthe very slightest disturbance. The manorial officials, who in the South\r\nwere cursed as the agents of evictions and rack-renting, were in the\r\nNorth much concerned with keeping tenants on the soil. At Acklington the\r\ntenants, writes Clarkson, \"must be helped and rather cherished for\r\nservice sake.\" At High Buston the holdings of the tenantry have been\r\nincreased in order that \"they should the better live and do their\r\ndutiful service to their Lord and master,\" and a freeholder is rebuked\r\nfor action which results in curtailing the commonable area on the ground\r\nthat \"the tenants be but poor men and be not well horsed, as they are\r\nbound by their copies.\" At Tughall[342] the surveyor complains bitterly\r\nin 1567 that in time past, apparently a long time past, twenty-three\r\ntenants had been reduced to eight by \"such as nothing regard his\r\nlordship's service, nor the commonwealth.\" To what are we to ascribe\r\nthis permanence of tenure among the peasants, this exceptional\r\nsolicitude for the maintenance of a numerous tenantry on the part of\r\nsurveyors? Partly, no doubt, to the fact that Northumberland lay apart\r\nfrom the main stream of commercial life, and was as yet little affected\r\nby the growth of the woollen industry. Mainly, however, it was the\r\nresult of the military importance of a numerous tenantry on the\r\nNorthumbrian border. In that wild corner which is neither England nor\r\nScotland, English and Scots, Scroopes and bold Buccleughs, gnash their\r\nteeth at each other across the wan water of the Eden. In the long\r\nnorthern evenings about Lammastide moormen win their hay with axes in\r\ntheir belts and bows piled in the corner of the field, and customary\r\ntenants are bound by their copies to provide horse and armour, and to\r\nride to the musters in person or by proxy. No wonder that while\r\nelsewhere landlords pore over their accounts of wool or timber, in\r\nNorthumberland they should measure their wealth by the men whom they can\r\nbring out when the summons goes, and insist on feudal obligations with a\r\nrigour unknown in the South. When any night Scotch[343] raiders may come\r\nstorming over the marches, any night the red cock may crow up to the\r\nvery walls of merry Carlisle, a holding means not only a piece of land\r\nthat grows wheat and feeds sheep, but a horseman in harness; and the\r\ndropping out of a holding, or its merging in that of some one else,\r\nresults in the weakening of the force on which the peace of the border\r\ndepends. As a consequence, there is nothing like free trade in land\r\nbetween the tenants, such as developed in the South under the forms of\r\nsurrender and admission, and there is little incentive for the lord or\r\nhis officials to get rid of them. Such an exceptional state of things\r\ncomes to an end in Northumberland with the union of the two Crowns under\r\nJames I., and its termination is the signal for an attempt to break down\r\ncustomary tenures on the part both of the Crown[344] and of private\r\nlandowners.[345] But it survives a century longer on the border than it\r\ndoes elsewhere, and while it lasts it offers a standard by which may be\r\nmeasured the extent and significance of the change which is overtaking\r\nagrarian relationships in other parts of England, where commerce is more\r\ndeveloped, and where, since a tenant can no longer serve his lord by\r\nfighting, a sheep may easily be more valuable than a man. With the\r\ndevelopment of a strong central Government the military strength of the\r\ngreat landlords was broken, though it blazed up in the Pilgrimage of\r\nGrace and in the rebellion of 1569, and as a consequence they turned\r\ntheir attention to getting the maximum economic return from the soil, or\r\nto adding to their social dignity by parks, instead of maintaining a\r\nlarge body of tenants upon it.[346]\r\n\r\n    [340] See the Paston Letters, _passim_; and also the account\r\n    given in _Hist. MSS. Com._, Cd. 5567 (Report on the MSS. of Lord\r\n    Middleton), 142?-145, of the marvellous doings of Sir Gylles\r\n    Strangways in Dorsetshire as late as 1539; pp. 115?-117 contain\r\n    a similar case of private warfare from the year 1477.\r\n\r\n    [341] _Northumberland County History_, _e.g._ Amble (vol. v.),\r\n    Acklington (_ibid._), High Buston (_ibid._), Birling (_ibid._);\r\n    vol. viii. p. 230, figures as to eight manors in Tynmouthshire.\r\n    At Birling out of ten names which appear in the surveys of 1567,\r\n    eight reappear in 1616; at Acklington, out of eighteen names,\r\n    nine reappear; at High Buston, out of four names, four reappear\r\n    in 1616 and two in 1702.

S. P. D.

Apparently the instructions were not carried\r\n    out, as in 1642 the Long Parliament was discussing the subject\r\n    of the border tenures (Rushworth _Collections_, Pt. III., vol.\r\n    ii. p. 86).\r\n\r\n    [345] See below, pp. 257?-258.\r\n\r\n    [346] The effect of the Tudor policy on the land system is\r\n    excellently described by Harrington in _Oceana_, and also in\r\n    _The Art of Law-giving_: \"Henry VII. being conscious of the\r\n    infirmity of his title, yet finding with what strength and\r\n    vigour he was brought in by the Nobility, conceived jealousy of\r\n    the like power in case of a decay or change of affections.\r\n    _Nondum orbis adoraverat Roman._ The lords yet led country\r\n    lives; their houses were open to retainers, men experienced in\r\n    military affairs and capable of commanding; their hospitality\r\n    was the delight of their tenants who by their tenure or\r\n    dependence were obliged to follow their lords in arms. So that,\r\n    this being the Militia of the nation, a few noblemen\r\n    discontented could at any time levy a great army, the effect\r\n    whereof both in the Barons Wars and those of York and Lancaster\r\n    had been well known to divers kings. This state of things was\r\n    that which enabled Henry VII. to make his advantage of\r\n    troublesome times and the frequent unruliness of retainers;\r\n    while, under pretence of curbing riots, he obtained the passing\r\n    of such laws as did cut off these retainers, whereby the\r\n    nobility wholly lost their officers. Then, whereas the\r\n    dependence of the people on their lords was of a strict ty or\r\n    nature, he found means to loosen this also by laws which he\r\n    obtained upon a fair pretence, even that of Population. But the\r\n    nobility, who by the former law had lost their officers, by this\r\n    lost their soldiery. Yet remained to them their estates, till\r\n    the same Prince introducing the Statutes for alienations, these\r\n    also became loose; and the lords, less taken (for the reasons\r\n    shown) with their country lives, where their trains were\r\n    clipped, by degrees became more resident at court, where greater\r\n    pomp and expense by the Statute of Alienations began to plume\r\n    them of their Estates\" (Harrington, _Works_, 1700 edition, pp.\r\n    388-?389).\r\n\r\nThe change meant an advance in civilisation among the upper classes, and\r\na tightening of economic pressure upon the peasantry. The feudal\r\nseigneur had at his worst been a lawless tyrant, and at his best a\r\ndespotic parent. But he had governed his estate as the sovereign, often\r\nthe resident sovereign, of a petty kingdom, whose interests were\r\nroughly identical with his own; and though his depredations were a\r\nterror to his neighbours, his own tenants had little to fear from them,\r\nfor his tenants were the force on which his very existence depended. In\r\nthe new political conditions his occupation was gone, and his place was\r\ntaken by two types of landed proprietor who were at once more peaceable\r\nand less popular. On the one hand, there emerges the landlord who is a\r\nlaborious and acute man of business, and who sets about exploiting the\r\nmaterial resources of his estate with the instincts of a shopkeeper and\r\nthe methods of a land-agent. Of this kind are the Willoughbys[347] in\r\nthe Midlands and the Delavales[348] in Northumberland. Often they are\r\nsheep-farmers. When their land is rich in minerals they sink coal-pits\r\nand mine for iron ore. The predecessors of the captains of industry of\r\ntwo and a half centuries later, they employ labour on a large scale,\r\nthey open up trade across country by river, they higgle over port dues,\r\nthey experiment with new inventions, they clear away without mercy any\r\ncustomary rights which conflict with their own. On the other hand, there\r\nare the gentry who buzz about the Court, regard London as the centre of\r\nthe universe, and have periodically to be ordered home to look after the\r\naffairs of their country-sides by a peremptory mandate from the\r\nGovernment. When this type becomes prominent, in the reign of Elizabeth,\r\nit most commonly spends its time in the interminable pursuit of\r\nprofitable sinecures, and in endeavouring to induce the City to believe\r\nthat thrice-mortgaged estates are a gilt-edged security. At its worst it\r\nproduces Sir Petronel Flash,[349] a figure as typical of the sixteenth\r\ncentury as Squire Western is of the eighteenth. At its best it\r\npatronises the arts, sets sail for a new world of drama and romance,\r\nsighs over Vergil's Eclogues, and goes pricking, almost too graceful a\r\nchivalry, through the fairy kingdoms of Spenser. But the men of\r\nbusiness, and the men of fashion, and the patrons of literature, are\r\nalike in being the symptoms of a new economic and political system, a\r\nsystem which has shorn landownership of the territorial sovereignty\r\nwhich had gone with it, broken down the personal relations of landlord\r\nand tenant, and, by turning agriculture into a business, has made it at\r\nonce more profitable and less strenuous for the former, more exacting\r\nand less stable for the latter, than it had been when a lordlord was not\r\nonly a drawer of rents but a local sovereign, a tenant not only a source\r\nof income but a dependent who was bound by a tie which was almost\r\nsacramental. \"It was never a merry world since gentlemen came up\";\r\n\"never so many gentlemen and so little gentleness\"; \"the commons long\r\nsince did rise in Spain and kill the gentlemen, and since have lived\r\nmerrily there\"; such are some of the blessings the new landlords would\r\nhear from men who grumble to their mates between the spells of shearing\r\nsheep and mowing hay. Those who have watched the uncouth, rough-handed\r\nmaster of a backward industry, who has wrought among his workmen as a\r\nfriend or a tyrant, blossom, under the fertilising influence of\r\nexpanding markets, into the sedate suburban capitalist who sets up a\r\ncountry house in the second generation and sends his sons to Oxford in\r\nthe third, and who scientifically speeds up his distant operatives\r\nthrough the mediation of an army of managers and assistant-managers and\r\nforemen, will not need to be reminded that economic changes which bring\r\ncivilisation to one class may often be fraught with ruin to another. The\r\nbrilliant age which begins with Elizabeth gleams against a background of\r\nsocial squalor and misery. The descendant of the illiterate,\r\nbloody-minded baron who is muzzled by Henry VII. becomes a courteous\r\ngentleman who rhapsodises in verse at the Court of Gloriana. But all\r\nthat the peasants know is that his land-agents[350] are harsher. An\r\nEarl of Pembroke has been given immortality by Shakespeare. But the\r\nfirst of his name had founded the family on estates which had belonged\r\nto the Abbey of Wilton,[351] and by his exactions had provoked the\r\nWiltshire peasants into rebellion. The Raleigh family--it was a\r\nRaleigh's chance gibe at the old religion which set the West in a blaze\r\nin 1549--had endowed itself with a manor torn from the see of\r\nWells,[352] as the Grenvilles had done with the lands of Buckland Abbey.\r\nThe gentle Sidney's _Arcadia_ is one of the glories of the age, and it\r\nwas composed, if we may trust tradition, in the park at the Herberts'\r\ncountry-seat at Washerne,[353] which they had made by enclosing a whole\r\nvillage and evicting the tenants. The dramatists who reflect the high\r\npopular estimation of the freeholder[354] see nothing in the grievances\r\nof Mouldy and Bullcalf except the disposition of an ignorant populace to\r\ncry for the moon. Shakespeare's Cade, with his programme[355] of seven\r\nhalf-penny loaves for a penny, and the three-hooped pot that shall have\r\nten hoops, is so far proposing only what an energetic mayor is quite\r\nprepared to carry out before breakfast. His crowning absurdity, which\r\nmakes the stalls hiss and the pit cheer, is the promise that \"all the\r\nrealm shall be in common; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to\r\ngrass.\" A few months after these words were printed Cade came to life in\r\nearnest. In the autumn of 1596 some Oxfordshire[356] artisans and\r\npeasants organised a revolt against \"the gentlemen who took the\r\ncommons,\" and from that year onwards to 1601 Parliament and the Council\r\nhad their hands full of the question of enclosures. Men feel the\r\ncontrast, even when it is only just beginning, and with natural\r\ninconsistency sigh for the old order even while they are glorifying the\r\nnew. \"Princes and Lords,\" wrote Henry VIII.'s chaplain[357] about 1538,\r\n\"seldom look to the good order and wealth of their subjects, only they\r\nlook to the receiving of their rents and revenues of their lands with\r\ngreat study of enhancing thereof, to the further maintaining of their\r\npompous state; so that if their subjects do their duty therein justly,\r\npaying their rents at time affixed, for the rest they care not (as is\r\ncommonly said) 'whether they sink or swim'\"!\r\n\r\n    [347] _Hist.

S., _England in the Reign of Henry VIII._, p. 85.\r\n\r\nWhile the centralised government of the Tudors gave a new bias to the\r\ninterests of landlords by stripping them of part of their political\r\npower, economic changes were hurrying the more enterprising among them\r\ninto novel methods of estate management. In the situation which\r\ndeveloped in the first fifty years of the sixteenth century they were\r\nexposed to pressure from two sides at once. They stood to gain much if\r\nthey adapted their farming to meet the new commercial conditions. They\r\nstood to lose much if they were so conservative as to adhere to the old\r\nmethods. The explanation of the agrarian revolution most generally given\r\nby contemporary observers was that enclosing was due to the increased\r\nprofitableness of pasture farming, consequent upon the development of\r\nthe textile industries; and though a recent writer[358] has endeavoured\r\nto show that most of the land enclosed was used for tillage, and that\r\ntherefore this explanation cannot hold good, there does not seem any\r\nvalid reason for disputing it. The testimony of observers is very\r\nstrong; they might be mistaken as to the extent of the movement towards\r\npasture, but hardly as to its tendency; and with scarcely an exception\r\nthey point to the growth of the woollen trade as the chief motive for\r\nenclosing.\r\n\r\n    [358] See the discussion between Mr. Leadam and Professor Gay\r\n    in _Trans. Royal Hist. Society_, vol. xiv., new series.\r\n\r\nMoreover, their evidence is confirmed by the proofs which we possess of\r\nthe expansion of the woollen industry at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. It is true that the figures collected by Thorold Rogers do not\r\nenable any satisfactory correlation to be made between the rise in wool\r\nprices and the progress of pasture farming. But they are statistically\r\nmuch too unreliable to upset the direct evidence of eyewitnesses, being\r\nbased on various measures which are somewhat arbitrarily reduced to a\r\nsupposed common standard, relating to many different qualities of wool,\r\nand being weighted in particular years by a preponderance of prices from\r\nparticular counties which are sometimes clearly not typical at all. The\r\nfigures of Schanz[359] as to the export trade in wool and woollen\r\ncloths, are a sufficient proof of the growth in the output of wool, and\r\ntherefore in the growth of sheep-farming. They show that while the\r\nexport of unmanufactured wool fell off in the sixteenth century, that of\r\ngrey cloth grew enormously. In 1354 the export had been 4774-1/2 pieces,\r\nfrom 1509 to 1523 it averaged 84,789 pieces a year, from 1524 to 1533,\r\n91,394 pieces, from 1534 to 1539, 102,647 pieces, and from 1540 to 1547,\r\n122,354 pieces, while in 1554 the total manufacture was estimated at\r\n160,000 pieces of cloth and 250,000 pieces of hosiery. This expansion of\r\nthe manufactured cloth industry was only the culmination of a growth\r\nwhich had been going on gradually for a hundred years. In 1464 the\r\nFlemish manufacturers[360] were complaining that their market had been\r\ninvaded by English clothiers. Merchants like the Celys shipped enormous\r\nconsignments of wool from the Cotswolds to the Continent.[361] The large\r\nnumber of sheep kept in England at the end of the fifteenth century was\r\nthe amazement of foreigners;[362] and English buyers groaned over the\r\nhigh prices to which wool was driven by the competition of continental\r\nbuyers.[363] The revolution in the technique of agriculture when sucked\r\ninto the vortex of expanding commerce is, in fact, simply an early,\r\nand, owing to the immobility of sixteenth century conditions, a\r\npeculiarly striking example of that reaction of widening markets on the\r\nmethods of production, which is one of the best established of economic\r\ngeneralisations.\r\n\r\n    [359] Schanz, _Englische Handelspolitik gegen Ende des\r\n    Mittelalters_, Band II., p. 18.\r\n\r\n    [360] Abram, _Social England in the Fifteenth Century_, p. 33.\r\n\r\n    [361] _Ibid._, pp. 40-41.\r\n\r\n    [362] Camden Society (1847), _Italian Relation of England_.\r\n\r\n    [363] Camden Society (third series, vol. i.), _Cely Papers_. In\r\n    1480 the elder Cely writes: \"I have not bought this year a loke\r\n    of woll, for the woll of Cottyswolde is bought by the\r\n    Lombardys;\" and in the following year, \"Ye avyse me for to buye\r\n    woll in Cottyswolde, bot it is at grate prise, 3s. 4d. a tod,\r\n    and gret ryding for woll in Cottyswolde as was any yere this vii\r\n    yere.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the revolution was probably hastened by a change in\r\ncommercial policy, which, while encouraging the export trade in woollen\r\ncloth, was after 1485 less favourable to the corn-grower. During the\r\ngreater part of the fifteenth[364] century the Government was forced by\r\nthe agrarian interests to allow freedom of export for grain except when\r\nprices reached a certain height, after which point an export licence was\r\nrequired. But the victory of Henry VII. produced a policy which was less\r\ninfluenced by the traditional object of helping the corn-growing\r\nlandlords, and more favourable to commerce and the middle classes on\r\nwhich the new monarchy rested. In 1491[365] the export of grain, except\r\nwith a special licence, was forbidden altogether, and in 1512 the\r\nprohibition was repeated by Henry VIII. Though the administration of\r\nsuch a policy must have been difficult, and its exact effect must be a\r\nmatter of conjecture, the view taken by some contemporaries,[366] that\r\nit was a subordinate cause which stimulated the abandonment of old\r\nagricultural methods and caused a good deal of land to go out of\r\ncultivation, is at any rate intrinsically probable.\r\n\r\n    [364] Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_,\r\n    Early and Middle Ages, pp. 447-448.

The agrarian\r\nchanges of the sixteenth century cannot be traced primarily to the\r\nrevolution in general prices which all European countries experienced,\r\nbecause they had already proceeded some way before the full extent of\r\nthe movement in prices became apparent. Throughout the fifteenth century\r\nthe value of money, as far as can be judged from such statistics as we\r\npossess, was fairly stable, and, if anything, somewhat appreciated.\r\nDuring the first half of Henry VIII.'s reign there were complaints[367]\r\nof the scarcity of the metallic currency. On the very eve of the\r\ndissolution of the monasteries we find a religious house in\r\nNorthumberland reversing the movement which had been going on for two\r\ncenturies in most parts of the country, and actually commuting money\r\nrents into payments in kind,[368] on the ground that the tenants could\r\nnot command the necessary coin. Such facts should warn us that England\r\nwas far from being a single economic community, and that the effects of\r\nthe cheap money penetrated into the more backward regions only very\r\nslowly indeed. Nevertheless, in the more advanced parts of the country,\r\nthe tide turned soon after the beginning of the new century, though it\r\nwas not till the fourth decade of it that it became a mill-race in which\r\nall old economic standards were submerged. The general course of the\r\nmovement, so far as it affected commodities in general use, is set forth\r\nbelow. The figures are re-arranged from those supplied by Steffen,[369]\r\nwhose work is mainly based on that of Thorold Rogers.\r\n\r\n    [367] See the whole question discussed in Schanz, _Englische\r\n    Handelspolitik_, Band II., pp. 481-540.\r\n\r\n    [368] _Northumberland County History_, vol. viii. p. 232. In\r\n    1595 a dispute as to corn rents arose between the Earl of\r\n    Northumberland and the Tynemouthshire tenants, the Earl\r\n    insisting on payment by the Newcastle measure, the tenants\r\n    demanding to pay by the Winchester measure, on the ground that\r\n    they are so poor that \"they are not able with horse, furniture,\r\n    and geare to serve as their ancestors have done, as it appeared\r\n    upon the late muster.\" Evidence given by an ancient yeoman\r\n    before the Commission appointed to hear the case showed that the\r\n    tenants had formerly paid in money, and that the change from\r\n    money to corn had been introduced in the time of the last Prior\r\n    for the sake of the tenants, not for the sake of the Priory.\r\n\r\n    [369] Steffen, _Studien zur Geschichte der Englischen\r\n    Lohnarbeiter_, Band I., pp. 254-255 and 365-366.\r\n\r\nTABLE VII\r\n\r\n+---------+----------+----------+----------+---------+\r\n|         |  Wheat   |   Peas   |   Oats   | Barley  |\r\n|         | per Qr.  |  per Qr. |  per Qr. |  Malt   |\r\n|         |          |          |          | per Qr .|\r\n+---------+----------+----------+----------+---------+\r\n|         |          |          |          |         |\r\n|         |  s. d.   |  s. d.   |  s. d.   |  s. d.  |\r\n|1401-1450|  5  9-1/4|  3  2-3/4|  7  9    |  4  3   |\r\n|1451-1500|  5  6-1/4|  3  4-3/4|  6  6-3/4|  3  8   |\r\n|1501-1540|  6 10-1/4|  5  1-3/4|  9  4-3/4|  4  5   |\r\n|1541-1582| 13 10-1/2|  . . .   | 20 10-3/4| 10  5   |\r\n|         |          |          |          |         |\r\n+---------+----------+----------+----------+---------+\r\n\r\n+---------+----------+----------+----------+------+------+\r\n|         |          |          |          |      | Eggs |\r\n|         |  Oxen.   |  Sheep.  |   Pigs.  | Hens.|  per |\r\n|         |          |          |          |      |Gross.|\r\n+---------+----------+----------+----------+------+------+\r\n|         |          |          |          |      |      |\r\n|         |  s. d.   |  s. d.   |  s. d.   | d.   | d.   |\r\n|         |          |          |          |      |      |\r\n|1401-1450| 16  5-1/2|  2  1    |  7  6-3/4| 2    | 5    |\r\n|1451-1500| 15  7-1/2|  1 10-1/4|  8  3-1/4| 2-1/4| 5-1/4|\r\n|1501-1540| 22  9    |  2 10-1/4| 10  0    | 3    | 9    |\r\n|1541-1582| 70  0-1/4|  6  4    |   . . .  | 4-3/4| . . .|\r\n|         |          |          |          |      |      |\r\n+---------+----------+----------+----------+------+------+\r\n\r\nThough it would not be right, of course, to force these figures too\r\nfar, as one cannot be sure that they are in all cases typical, the\r\nindication which they offer of a remarkable rise in prices beginning\r\nsoon after 1500 is in all probability substantially correct. The result\r\nof this movement in dragging down the standard of comfort of the people\r\nhas often been noticed, and need not be emphasised here. But it is\r\nimportant to observe that it had a very marked effect upon the\r\ntraditional methods of agriculture, because it supplied landowners with\r\na new incentive to squeeze the utmost possible income out of their\r\nestates. Since they were buying everything dearer, they were under a\r\nstrong inducement to turn land to the most profitable use, and to revise\r\nall existing contracts which prevented an advance in tenants' payments.\r\nIn the not unnatural confusion which surrounded the question of the\r\ncause of the general rise in prices, this aspect of the agrarian\r\ntroubles failed very generally to be appreciated by contemporary\r\nwriters, who were inclined to argue that the higher prices were due to\r\nthe increased rents, instead of seeing that the increased rents were\r\nthemselves the consequence of the increased prices. But it was\r\nemphasised in the middle of the century by the author of the\r\n_Commonwealth of England_,[370] and at the end of it by Gerrard de\r\nMalynes,[371] who puts the case with great power and perspicacity,\r\nthough he perhaps may be thought to exaggerate the importance of the\r\ndebasement of the currency. \"Every man knoweth,\" he wrote in 1601, \"that\r\nby reason of the base money coined in the end of the most victorious\r\nreign of King Henry VIII. all the forrain commodities were sold dearer,\r\nwhich made afterwards the commodities of the realm to rise at the\r\nfarmers' and tenants' hands, and therefore gentlemen did raise the rents\r\nof their lands and take farms themselves and made inclosures of\r\ngrounds, and the price of everything being dearer was made dearer though\r\nplenty of money and bullion coming daily from the West Indies.... If we\r\nrequire gentlemen to abate their rents, give over farms, and break up\r\nenclosures, it may be they would do so if they might have all their\r\nprovisions at the price heretofore.\" Yet such a statement gives but a\r\nfaint indication of the revolutionary effect upon agrarian relationships\r\nof the depreciation in the value of money. The modern reader, before\r\nwhose eyes all economic standards are fluctuating from day to day, can\r\nhardly grasp the anarchy which it tended to produce in a world where\r\nvalues, especially land values, were objective realities which had stood\r\nunaltered for centuries together. The landlord sees his income slipping\r\nfrom him, though his estate pays as much as before. The tenant finds his\r\nlandlord pressing for higher rents and fines, though the yield of the\r\nland has not increased. Yet neither desires anything but to remain as\r\nthey were, and both are ignorant of the force which sweeps them out of\r\nthe ancient ways. For, in the wholesome manner of the age, they ascribe\r\nall economic evils to personal misdemeanours, the unreasonableness of\r\nmerchants, the covetousness of gentlemen, the extortions of husbandmen,\r\nand the real cause is an impersonal one, which carries them forward\r\nagainst their will, like men \"thrusting one another in a throng, one\r\ndriving on another.\"[372] It is easy to understand that it must have\r\nbeen difficult to maintain customary payments and traditional methods of\r\nagriculture against the screw which the rise in prices turned on the\r\nlandowning classes. Agricultural experiments were in the air, and with\r\nexperts explaining how to double the value of an estate by enclosure\r\nwithout prejudicing the tenants, it is not surprising that landowners,\r\nwho saw their real incomes dwindling with the fall in the value of\r\nmoney, should have adopted the principle of their advice and neglected\r\nthe qualifications.\r\n\r\n    [370] _The Commonweal of this Realm of England_ (Lamond),\r\n    especially p. 81: \"Knight: What sorte is that which youe said\r\n    had greater loss thereby then those men had profitte? Doctor: It\r\n    is all noblemen, and gentlemen, and all other that live by a\r\n    fixed rent, or stipend, or doe not maner the grounde, or do\r\n    occupie no byinge or sellinge.... He that maie spend £300 a\r\n    yeare by such revennewes and fees, may kepe no better porte then\r\n    his father, or anie before him, that could spend but £200. And\r\n    so ye maie perceave, it is a great abatement of a man's\r\n    countenance to take awaie the third part of his livinge. And\r\n    therefore gentlemen doe so much studie the Increase of theire\r\n    landes, enhauncing of their rentes, and so take farmes and\r\n    pastures into theire owne hands.\"\r\n\r\n    [371] _A Treatise of the Canker of England's Commonwealth_\r\n    (1601).\r\n\r\n    [372] _The Commonweal of this Realm of England_ (Lamond), p.\r\n    100.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) _The Growth of the Large Leasehold Farm_\r\n\r\nThe changed situation created by these causes had the effect of\r\nproducing a new policy on the part of landlords, which took different\r\nforms according to the circumstances of different localities, but which\r\nin the counties most deeply affected resulted in an increase in\r\npasture-farming and in an upward movement in the payments made by\r\ntenants. The new régime seems to have affected first, as was natural,\r\nthat part of their estates which was most entirely under their own\r\ncontrol, and the disposal of which was least involved in other\r\ninterests, namely, the manorial demesne. It is not altogether easy to\r\nconstruct a picture of the policy pursued by a typical enclosing\r\nlandlord from the accounts of contemporaries, who were more interested\r\nin results than in the steps by which they were reached. According to\r\nsome of them, lords in the sixteenth century were resuming into their\r\nown hands those parts of the demesne which had been let out, in order to\r\nsupply their establishments with produce without having to rely on the\r\nmarkets when prices were rapidly rising. On some manors again, when the\r\ndemesne was \"in the hand of the lord,\" considerations which were not\r\npurely economic came into play; for example, one finds part of it being\r\nturned into a park, which was at once profitable as a means of grazing\r\nsheep, and prized for those motives of social amenity and ostentation\r\nwhich have done so much to make the English countryside the admiration\r\nof travellers, and so much to ruin the English peasantry. It was not\r\nseldom that the confiscated estates of monastic houses were converted\r\ninto a pleasaunce or a deer-park by their new proprietors.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the manorial documents suggest that landlords were\r\nusually rather parties to changes in the methods of cultivation than\r\nthemselves the agents who carried them out, because, at any rate in the\r\ncase of the larger landowners, the demesnes were usually leased. The\r\nactual process of experiment and innovation took place on most manors\r\nthrough the instrumentality of the lessee.[373] The large farmer, who on\r\nmany manors is found managing the demesne, is much the most striking\r\ncharacter in the rural development of the sixteenth century. His\r\nfortunes wax while those of the peasantry wane. Gradually he thrusts\r\nthem, first copyholders and then yeomen, into the background, and\r\nbecomes in time the parent of a mighty line, which later ages,\r\nforgetting poor Piers Plowman, whose place he has usurped, will look on\r\nas the representative of all that is solid and unchanging in the English\r\nsocial order. In our period he plays in the economics of agriculture the\r\npart which was played in industry by the capitalist clothier, and his\r\nposition as the pivot of agrarian change is so important that it will\r\nrepay close attention.\r\n\r\n    [373] This may seem inconsistent with the fact that in the\r\n    statistics published by Mr. Leadam from the Inquisition of 1517\r\n    most enclosures in most counties are entered as made by lords of\r\n    manors. I do not think, however, that this is necessarily so.\r\n    When it is stated that a lord of a manor has enclosed and\r\n    converted to pasture, it may very well be meant that his agent\r\n    did so with his consent. _I.e._ the distinction would appear to\r\n    be not between the lord and the lord's farmer, but between the\r\n    manorial authorities (lord and farmer) and the rest of the\r\n    landholders. The phrase used in the Berkshire returns, \"converti\r\n    permisit,\" indicates what I take to have been the most general,\r\n    though not, of course, the invariable, course of events.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, it is clear that the foundation of the large\r\nfarm was the practice of leasing the demesne for a term of years, which\r\nwas the normal way of disposing of it in the sixteenth century. In the\r\nreign of Elizabeth the distinction between the demesne and the customary\r\ntenancies still survived, and surveyors were at some pains to separate\r\nthem in order to prevent the demesne being merged in the customary\r\nholdings. But the original meaning of the distinction had been almost\r\nobliterated; the demesne was no longer the centre of the manorial\r\neconomy, as it had been when its produce maintained the lord's\r\nhousehold, and the labour of the customary tenants, in spite of the\r\nsurvival of many services, no longer supplied the chief means of\r\ncultivating it. On the whole, it would be true to say that on\r\nninety-nine manors out of a hundred the demesne was leased by the middle\r\nof the sixteenth century, and on the majority of them probably at a much\r\nearlier date. There are, of course, some exceptions. Certain manors the\r\nlord makes his headquarters, and there the home farm is retained in his\r\nhands, because it is required to supply his establishment. On other\r\nmanors the demesne or part of it can no longer be distinguished from the\r\nholdings of the customary tenants, and is held by them by copy of Court\r\nRoll in the same way as the \"customary land.\" In certain parts of\r\nEngland, again, the leasing of the demesne has not proceeded far,\r\nbecause the demesne has always been relatively unimportant. On several\r\nNorthumberland manors, for example, the surveyor[374] could in 1567 find\r\nno demesne at all, either because it had all been divided up among the\r\ntenants, or because it had never existed. Nevertheless, in spite of\r\nthese exceptions, a lease for a term of years to a farmer or farmers is\r\nthe ordinary method of disposing of the demesne in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. This is proved in a very satisfactory way by the investigations\r\nof Professor Savine[375] into the disposition of the lands of monastic\r\nhouses in 1534. After an exhaustive inquiry relating to several hundred\r\nmanors he found that the cases in which the demesne was not leased were\r\nan insignificant proportion of the whole. An examination of smaller\r\ngroups of manors tells the same story. Out of thirty-six[376] manors in\r\nWiltshire, Somersetshire, and Devonshire surveyed for the Earl of\r\nPembroke in 1568, it is possible to determine the use made of the\r\ndemesne on thirty-two, and on twenty-nine of them it was leased. Of\r\ntwenty-nine other manors examined at random at different periods in the\r\nsixteenth and early seventeenth century every one was in the same\r\ncondition. There is no reason to distrust these instances on the ground\r\nthat they may represent a development occurring too late in the century\r\nto be relevant to movements found in existence at the beginning of it,\r\nbecause in several cases where the history of a manor can be traced\r\nbackwards, it is clear, as has been shown above, that the leasing of the\r\ndemesne was quite common at least from the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and in parts of the country much earlier.\r\n\r\n    [374] _e.g._ at Acklington (_Northumberland County History_,\r\n    vol. v.), of which Clarkson the surveyor writes: \"Neither is\r\n    there any demaine lands or demaine meadows, but all is occupied\r\n    together in husbandry\"; at Birling (_ibid._): \"There is no\r\n    demaine land or meadow, with all their husbandlands and meadows\r\n    appertaining to the same\"; apparently also at High Buston.\r\n    Compare Vinogradoff, _Villainage in England_, p. 316: \"Villages\r\n    without a manorial demesne ... are found ... where the power of\r\n    the lord was more a political than an economical one\" (Norfolk\r\n    and Suffolk, Lincoln, Northumberland, Westmoreland, &c.). For a\r\n    manor where the demesne is kept in the hand of the lord in 1568\r\n    for the reason given above, see Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of\r\n    Pembroke Manors_, Manor of Washerne.\r\n\r\n    [375] _Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History_, pp. 153-154.\r\n\r\n    [376] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Lands of William, First Earl\r\n    of Pembroke_.\r\n\r\nFrom the allusions made by contemporaries to the large farmer as one of\r\nthe mainsprings of the changes of the period, one is disposed to look\r\nfirst at the demesne for the beginning of capitalist agriculture.\r\nWhether, however, the method of cultivating the demesne differed much\r\nfrom the cultivation of the customary holdings depended to a\r\nconsiderable extent upon the terms on which it was leased, and, in\r\nparticular, upon whether it passed into the control of a single\r\nconsiderable tenant. It would be a mistake to think that the economic\r\nrelationships which were established when the demesne ceased to be\r\ncultivated by villein labour were all of one type, or in particular that\r\nthe demesne invariably passed into the hands of one holder. Mention has\r\nalready been made of the practice of adding the demesne lands, or part\r\nof them, to the customary land held by copy of Court Roll, a practice\r\nwhich obviously resulted in maintaining in the hands of small\r\ncultivators land which might have gone to build up large properties.\r\n\r\nEven when the demesne is leased it is not always leased to a single\r\nlarge farmer. In reality the surveys of the sixteenth century reveal two\r\nwell-defined types of leasehold property subsisting on the lord's\r\ndemesne, sometimes on neighbouring manors. The first type has as its\r\ndistinctive feature that the lessees are a number, sometimes a very\r\nlarge number, of small farmers, who have been given allotments on the\r\ndemesne and who hold them for various periods of years, sometimes for\r\nlife only, sometimes for eighty, sometimes for ninety-two or\r\nninety-nine, years. Many examples of this type of small leaseholder come\r\nfrom the west of England. Thus at Ablode,[377] in Somersetshire, before\r\nthe demesne was leased out by St. Peter's to a large farmer in 1515, it\r\nhad already been leased to seventeen of the customary tenants. At\r\nPaynton,[378] in 1568, the Barton land was held in small plots by\r\nfifty-one leaseholders, at South Brent[379] by eighteen. But examples of\r\nthis arrangement are found all over England. At Higham Ferrers,[380] in\r\nNorthamptonshire, the demesne has been divided among nine tenants; at\r\nStondelf,[381] in Staffordshire, among thirty-one. At Shape[382] in\r\nSuffolk and Northendale[383] in Norfolk the demesnes are added to the\r\nholdings of the customary tenants. At Forncett,[384] in Norfolk, parts\r\nof the demesne are in the same way leased out in small parcels in the\r\nfifteenth century for gradually lengthening periods of years, though by\r\nthe beginning of our period they seem to have been held by copy in the\r\nsame way as the customary land. Elsewhere we get what appear to be\r\nvariations of the same system, in the form of sub-letting or of\r\njoint-cultivation. At Castle Combe,[385] for example, the demesne lands\r\nwere leased in 1454 to four tenants, \"with the intention that they\r\nthemselves should let to farm to all the tenants of the lord some\r\nportion of those lands.\" On other manors groups of tenants seem to make\r\nthemselves jointly responsible for the rent required. It was not an\r\nunknown[386] thing even at quite an early date for a whole village to\r\ncome forward and make a kind of collective bargain with the lord as to\r\nthe terms upon which they would take over the demesne lands, and when\r\nthe leasing of the demesne became the regular practice townships\r\nsometimes stepped into the shoes of the bailiffs, and averted the entry\r\nof the large farmer by leasing the lands themselves, and making their\r\nown arrangements as to the way in which they should be utilised. One may\r\nsuspect, indeed, that such action took place in a good many cases when\r\nthe land was leased to many small tenants, as at Paynton and South\r\nBrent, even though the intervention of the township is not expressly\r\nstated. Sometimes, however, the communal character of the bargain is\r\nquite beyond doubt. For example, at Cucklington,[387] on the manor of\r\nStooke Trister in Somersetshire, twelve tenants leased together at a\r\nrent of £8 for forty years a sheep house with 250 acres of land. At\r\nChedsey,[388] in the same county, the whole of the demesne, which lay\r\nmainly in small parcels of one or two acres, was held in 1568 on a\r\ntwenty-one years' lease by the tenants of the manor. At Caston,[389] in\r\nNorfolk, we find an entry of rent which is paid by \"the inhabitants of\r\nthe town of Scratby for certain lands occupied for their benefit.\" The\r\nphrase \"town lands,\" which appears not infrequently[390] in the surveys\r\nand estate maps of the sixteenth century may perhaps be taken as\r\nindicating the same conclusion. In what way exactly we ought to\r\ninterpret these arrangements--whether we should regard them as nothing\r\nmore than a summary expression of the fact that all the tenants have\r\nseverally rights over part of the estate, or whether we should conceive\r\nof them as implying some higher degree of corporate action than this,\r\nand as the outcome of a bargain struck with the lord by the village as a\r\nvillage, is an interesting and difficult question,[391] to which we\r\nshall recur later in speaking of rights of common. But we may mention\r\ntwo points which suggest that there is in them a certain element of\r\npractical communism to which legal historians sometimes do less than\r\njustice. The first is that we occasionally find certain tenants acting\r\non behalf[392] of, one might almost say, representing, others. The\r\nsecond is that in some cases the demesne lands are divided among them in\r\nexactly equal[393] shares, so that, though every one has more land than\r\nbefore, the relative sizes of their holdings are unaltered. The last\r\nfact is a very striking one. It means, in the first place, that the new\r\nland has been allotted on some common principle and by some formal\r\nagreement. Clearly, if each tenant had bought as much land as he\r\npleased, we should have had not equality but inequality. It points, in\r\nthe second place, to the enduring strength of the ideas and interests\r\nunderlying the system of agricultural shareholding which is\r\ncharacteristic of the mediæval village. We can understand a very\r\nprimitive system of agriculture designed to secure each household the\r\nstandard equipment needed to support it. But one would naturally suppose\r\nthat at the end of the Middle Ages, when new land which had hitherto\r\nbelonged to the lord was offered to the villagers, each would buy up as\r\nmuch as he could without regard to the interests of his neighbours. It\r\nis probable that in most cases, as in those quoted in Chapter III., this\r\nis what happened. But in some instances it is not. The old economic\r\nideas which had governed the disposition of the ancient customary\r\nholdings are applied to the new land which the cessation of demesne\r\ncultivation by the lord throws into the market, and the villagers\r\nre-allot it on the old plan. Even in its decay the mediæval land system\r\nshows its vitality by meeting new situations with the ancient methods.\r\n\r\n    [377] _Historia et Cartularium Monasterii Gloucestriæ_, vol.\r\n    iii.

Here the\r\n    demesne is held by twenty-two tenants, each having 8 acres, 3\r\n    roods, and 1 acre of meadow. Mickleholme meadow (also demesne\r\n    land) is held by five tenants, each having 1 acre. One finds on\r\n    some Northumberland manors a growth in the size of customary\r\n    holdings combined with the preservation of almost exact equality\r\n    between them, which surely must be taken as proving that the\r\n    increase in the area held grew, not by sporadic encroachments on\r\n    the part of individuals, but by definite allotment on some\r\n    communal plan. Thus at Birling there were in 1248 ten \"bondi,\"\r\n    each holding 30 acres or one husbandland; in 1498 nine holding\r\n    30 acres or one husbandland, and four holding one husbandland of\r\n    30 acres between them; in 1567 ten customary tenants, each\r\n    holding 33 acres; in 1616 the average holding has risen from 33\r\n    to 42-1/2 acres, but there is still substantial equality, the\r\n    largest holding amounting to 44 acres, 3 roods, 3-1/2 poles, and\r\n    the smallest to 40 acres, 0 roods, 33 poles (I omit the facts as\r\n    to the cottagers). In spite of two considerable additions to the\r\n    land of the village, there is little change in the relative\r\n    proportions of the tenancies. At Acklington there were in 1352\r\n    thirty-five bondage holdings of 16 acres each, of which nine\r\n    were vacant (presumably on account of the plague). In 1368 these\r\n    nine vacant holdings were let to the other tenants for herbage.\r\n    In 1498 there were eighteen tenants, of whom seventeen held two\r\n    husbandlands apiece (_i.e._ 32 acres) and one, one husbandland\r\n    (_i.e._ 16 acres). _Northumberland County History_, vol. v.\r\n\r\nThese small tenants were described as \"farming the demesne,\" and their\r\nexistence may perhaps mark a sort of half-way house in the evolution of\r\nthe manorial demesne into the large leasehold farm. One may suspect\r\nthat that development was not at all likely to take place rapidly in the\r\ncircumstances of the fifteenth century. According to the generally\r\naccepted view the practice of leasing part of the demesne, though\r\noccurring at a very early date on manors where the labour supply was too\r\nsmall for it to be cultivated by the villeins, received a great impetus\r\nfrom the scarcity of labour which was produced by the Great Plague, and\r\nwent on side by side with the gradual commutation of labour services\r\ninto money rents. Of course one must not dogmatise about changes which\r\ntook centuries to accomplish, and which developed at very different\r\ndegrees of speed in different parts of the country. But the accounts of\r\nparticular manors supplied us by surveyors bear out the view that the\r\ndevelopment of a class of small leaseholders took place as the result of\r\nthe abandonment of the old system of cultivating the demesne by means of\r\nthe works of the tenants organised under the supervision of the manorial\r\nofficials. \"The lorde departed his habitation and caused his officers to\r\ngrant out parte of his landes to his tenants at will.\" \"The medowes\r\nlying in Hinton were the lordes' severall meadowes, which nowe are\r\ndivided among the tenants.\" \"When the lorde departed his habitation, and\r\ngranted out the demesnes, the part was delivered and letten to the use\r\nof the tenants.\" \"One Sir John Taverney, Knight, dyd inhabit within the\r\nsaid mannor, and kept great hospitalitie, and occupied the demesnes in\r\nhis own possession, which are large and greate, and now of late years\r\ngranted out by copye for terms of lyves among the tenants.\" Such\r\ninformation, collected by a curious investigator[394] in the middle of\r\nthe sixteenth century from the lips of aged peasants in the west of\r\nEngland, takes us back to a time when the leasing of the demesne was a\r\ncomparative novelty. Is it surprising that the landlord who leased for\r\nthe first time should prefer to do so on this small scale, should choose\r\nto grant plots of land piecemeal for short terms of years rather than to\r\nform a single farm? The practice was at first an experiment, an alarming\r\ndeparture from accepted methods undertaken only through dire necessity.\r\nA great catastrophe like the plague might make it profitable, but time\r\nwould naturally elapse before it was done systematically and on a large\r\nscale. At the same time a class of farmers with sufficient capital to\r\nmanage several hundred acres of land could not come into existence at\r\nonce. The ordinary villein tenants, who were the first lessees on many\r\nmanors, could hardly jump immediately from farming twenty or thirty\r\nacres to farming a whole estate, though those of them who as bailiffs\r\nhad previously been responsible for managing the demesne, and who seem\r\nsometimes to have managed it as farmers for the lord, rather than as\r\nhired servants, were certainly in a better position to do so.\r\n\r\n    [394] Humberstone, _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i.\r\n    (surveys _temp._ Phil. and Mary of various manors belonging to\r\n    the Earl of Devon).\r\n\r\nIt would seem indeed that the question whether, when the sixteenth\r\ncentury began, the demesne lands of a manor were leased to many small\r\ntenants or to one or two large farmers, was decided largely by local and\r\npersonal conditions, and may fairly be described as a matter of chance.\r\nWhen they lay in many scattered strips unified culture was impossible\r\ntill they had been consolidated, and therefore there was no particular\r\nreason for leasing them to one tenant rather than to many; whereas, when\r\nthey were from the start in two or three great blocks, it was obviously\r\nvery improbable that they would be sub-divided. In those parts of the\r\ncountry where sheep-farming was less profitable than elsewhere one\r\nmotive for introducing a single large farm was absent, while where the\r\ndemesne had already been leased in small plots the manorial authorities\r\nmight dislike to make an abrupt change affecting many households\r\ndisadvantageously. The general movement would appear, however, to have\r\nbeen in the direction of longer leases and larger tenancies. Thus Miss\r\nDavenport has shown that at Forncett the leasing of the demesne\r\nbegan[395] in small parcels and for short periods from the end of the\r\nfourteenth century, and gradually took place on a larger scale and for\r\nlonger periods as the practice became more familiar. The earlier leases\r\nof the Oxfordshire manor of Cuxham[396] alternate between six and seven\r\nyears in length, and it is not till 1472 that the College owning it\r\nappears to have granted a lease of as much as twenty years. Sometimes\r\none can see the system of leasing small parcels to many little farmers,\r\nand that of leasing the whole demesne to one large farmer, coming into\r\ncompetition with each other. A case in point comes from Ablode[397] in\r\nSomersetshire. In 1515 the Abbot and Convent of St. Peter's, Gloucester,\r\nleased the whole manor of Ablode to a farmer for eighty years. But at\r\nthe time when the lease was made the demesne lands and demesne meadows\r\nwere already occupied by the customary tenants. Accordingly the covenant\r\nwith the farmer provides that as soon as the other tenants' agreements\r\nterminate, he shall have the reversion of their lands to use as he\r\npleases. Here the two types of demesne cultivation are seen merging into\r\none another, with the result that the large farm is consolidated out of\r\nthe small tenancies which preceded it.\r\n\r\n    [395] Davenport, _History of a Norfolk Manor_, p. 57. When first\r\n    leased in 1373 the demesne was leased as a whole, but this plan\r\n    was abandoned. Early in the fifteenth century it was leased in\r\n    small plots, at first for six or seven years, and then for\r\n    twelve, twenty, or forty years. Finally parts of the demesne\r\n    were granted to be held at fee farm.\r\n\r\n    [396] Merton Documents, Nos. 3100 (lease of 1361 for seven\r\n    years), 3002 (lease of 1420 for seven years); 2856 (lease of\r\n    1424 for one year); 1874 (lease of 1472 for twenty years).\r\n\r\n    [397] _Historia et Cartularium Monasterii Gloucestriæ_, vol.\r\n    iii. App., pp. 291-295. The words are \"Sed bene licebit præfatis\r\n    ... substituere tenentes ad eorum bene placitum in omnibus illis\r\n    terris dominicalibus supradictis modo in manibus tenentium\r\n    ibidem existentibus, cum reversio prædicta inde acciderit.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of our period these small demesne tenancies had already\r\ndisappeared from many manors, if they had ever existed on them, and the\r\nnormal method of using the demesne was to lease it to a single[398]\r\nlarge farmer, or at any rate to not more than three or four. In spite of\r\nthe instances given above, in which the home farm and its lands were\r\nsplit up among numerous small tenants, most of the evidence suggests\r\nthat the leasing of the demesne to a single farmer was as regular a way\r\nof disposing of it in the sixteenth century as its cultivation by\r\nmanorial officials with the labour of villeins had been in the\r\nthirteenth. The very slow development of the large farm in certain\r\nparts of the country was due rather to the insignificance or absence of\r\nthe demesne on some northern manors than to the prevalence of any\r\nalternative methods of utilising it. The terms on which the farmer took\r\nover the land varied naturally in detail, but these differences are\r\nunimportant. In a few cases he holds it by copy. Normally he is a\r\nleaseholder, sometimes for life, more usually for a period of years\r\nranging from twenty-one to eighty. Again the lessee's interest may be\r\nmore or less inclusive. Sometimes only the demesne, including any\r\ncustomary works upon it of the tenants which may survive, is leased.\r\nSometimes the lease includes the live-stock of the manor, which, or the\r\nequivalent of which, the farmer must replace at the end of his term.\r\nSometimes the profits of the court are leased as well, though more\r\nusually they are reserved, together with any income from fines, to the\r\nlord. Sometimes there is an arrangement of great interest and importance\r\nby which the whole body of manorial rights, including the income from\r\nthe courts, confiscation of straying beasts, and the rents of the\r\ncustomary tenants, are leased to the farmer, who thus becomes the\r\nimmediate landlord of the other tenants.[399] The greater part of the\r\nfarmer's rent is by the middle of the sixteenth century paid in money.\r\nBut certain payments in kind[400] survive, and supply a link between the\r\nvanishing subsistence cultivation, and the growing commercial economy.\r\nWhere money was scarce, tenants were sometimes allowed to pay in kind as\r\na concession to their interests, and some landlords still found it\r\nconvenient to receive part of their rent in grain, fowls, pigeons, fish,\r\nor a fat bull, a practice which on college estates lasted down to the\r\nvery end of the seventeenth century. But the value of such payments was\r\ncarefully calculated in terms of money, and they were the exception.\r\n\r\n    [398] Thus in 1535, on nineteen out of twenty-two manors owned\r\n    by Battle Abbey, the demesne was farmed by a single tenant, on\r\n    one by two, on one by three, while on one it was retained in the\r\n    hands of the monks (_Oxford Studies in Social and Legal\r\n    History_, vol. i.; _English Monasteries on the Eve of the\r\n    Dissolution_, by A. Savine). On twenty-five manors out of\r\n    thirty-two held by the Earl of Pembroke in 1568, the same\r\n    unified management obtained (Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of\r\n    Pembroke Manors_). Savine's remarks are to the point: \"The lord\r\n    of the manor seldom divided up the demesne into separate plots\r\n    of land to be let to local tenants. Usually the demesne and its\r\n    buildings, sometimes even together with the live and dead stock,\r\n    passed into the hands of one farmer\" (_ibid._).\r\n\r\n    [399] As at Knyghton in Wilts in 1568 (Roxburghe Club, _Pembroke\r\n    Surveys_), where the holdings and rents of the customary tenants\r\n    appear in the farmer's lease, _e.g._ \"Walter Savage ad\r\n    voluntatem tenet ut parcellam dicti manerii l close etc. ... et\r\n    reddit 56s. ad manus dicti firmarii.\"\r\n\r\n    [400] Here is an example from a lease of 1562. The farmer pays\r\n    \"yearly to the lord for the aforesaid farm--\r\n\r\n          10 quarters of corn, per bushel, 12d.               £4\r\n          20 quarters of barley, per bushel, 8d.       106s. 8d.\r\n          10 quarters of oats, per bushel, 3d.          26s. 8d.\r\n          20 capons, per caput, 4d.                      6s. 8d.\r\n          20 pigeons, per caput, 4d.                     6s. 8d.\r\n          12 great fish called trouts, per caput, 3d.        3s.\"\r\n\r\n     (Survey of South Newton, _ibid._).\r\n\r\nThe growth of large farms had proceeded so far by the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century that in parts of the country the area held by the\r\nfarmer was about equal to that held by all the other tenants. On some\r\nmanors it was less; on others it was a great deal more. The average area\r\nof the large farmer's land in Wiltshire seems to have been about 352\r\nacres, and it is not unusual to find manors where there are only two or\r\nthree customary tenants, while on some there were none at all. Wiltshire\r\nno doubt must not be taken as typical of all other counties, as the\r\nacreage of the leasehold farms held by men who had capital to spend\r\ncould so easily be increased by drawing in great tracts from the rolling\r\nstretches of Chalk Down. But elsewhere, though the acreage held by the\r\nfarmer of the demesne is less, 170 or 150 acres, and though one or two\r\nof the larger copyholders control a great deal of land themselves, he is\r\nstill, compared with the bulk of the customary tenants, a Triton among\r\nminnows. Arithmetical averages are, however, unsatisfactory, and a\r\nbetter idea of the scale on which the large farmer carried on business\r\nmay be obtained from the following table:--\r\n\r\n    TABLE VIII\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                         850-900 Acres.|\r\n  |                                                       800-849 Acres.|.|\r\n  |                                                     750-799 Acres.|.|.|\r\n  |                                                   700-749 Acres.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                                                 650-699 Acres.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                                               600-649 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                                             550-599 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                                           500-549 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                                         450-499 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                                       400-449 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                                     350-399 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                                   300-349 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                                 250-299 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                               200-249 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                             150-199 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                           100-149 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                           50-99 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  |                      Under 50 Acres.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  +-----------------------------------|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|\r\n  | Eighteen farms on sixteen         | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\r\n  |   manors in Norfolk               | |2|2|3|1| |3|1| |2|3| | | |1| | | |\r\n  |                                   | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\r\n  | Thirty-one farms on twenty-       | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\r\n  |   three manors in Wiltshire       |4|2|4|4|3|4|3| |2|1|1| | | | | |1|2|\r\n  |                                   | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\r\n  | Eighteen farms on thirteen        | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\r\n  |   manors in several counties      |2|3|3|1|3|2|1| | |3| | | | | | | | |\r\n  |                                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n  |   Total, sixty-seven farms        | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\r\n  |     on fifty-two manors           |6|7|9|8|7|6|7|1|2|6|4| | | |1| |1|2|\r\n  +-----------------------------------+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that if all the farms are grouped together, rather more\r\nthan one half, thirty-seven out of sixty-seven, have an area exceeding\r\n200 acres, and that the area of rather more than a quarter exceeds 350\r\nacres.

The advantage to the lord of the system of large\r\nfarms, compared either with the retention of the demesne in his own\r\nhands, or with the leasing of it in allotments to small tenants, was\r\nobvious enough for its extension to be no matter for surprise. The\r\nutilisation of the produce of the demesne by the lord's household was\r\nunnecessary when markets were sufficiently reliable to offer a regular\r\nsupply, and inconvenient when the landlord was an absentee. The division\r\nof the estate among small tenants meant the creation or maintenance of\r\ninterests opposed to agricultural changes, and made it impracticable to\r\nvary the methods of agriculture to meet varying demands, except by the\r\nrather cumbrous process of a common agreement ratified in the manorial\r\ncourt. The leasing of the demesne to a large farmer got rid of those\r\ndisadvantages. The lord was secured a regular money income, which was\r\nconsiderably higher per acre than that got from the customary tenants;\r\nand since the land was under the management of a single individual, who\r\nwas sometimes equipped with a good deal of capital, it was much easier\r\nto try experiments and to initiate changes. When not only the demesne,\r\nbut the whole body of manorial rights, was included in the lease, the\r\nproperty became of that most desirable kind, in which ownership is\r\nattenuated to a pecuniary lien on the product of industry, without\r\nadministrative responsibility for its management.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for new methods of cultivation were afforded by the\r\nleasing of the demesne to a single farmer, which would lead us to look\r\nat his holding as the place where agrarian changes were most likely to\r\nbegin, and to start from that in order to trace the effect of these\r\nlarge properties on the small properties of the customary tenants. On\r\nthe one hand, any wide development of leasehold tenure involves a\r\ncertain mobility in rural society and a disposition to break with\r\nroutine. There must be a market for land, which again implies that some\r\nclass has accumulated sufficient capital to invest and has got beyond\r\nmere subsistence farming. It naturally arises either when new[401] land\r\nis brought into cultivation, or when the development of trade makes\r\nfarming for the market profitable, or when changes are being introduced\r\ninto the methods of agriculture, or when the value of land is uncertain\r\n(for example, when it is thought that it may contain minerals),[402]\r\nbecause in all these cases leasehold, being a terminable interest,\r\nenables the owner of land to adjust his rent to the tenant's returns. On\r\nthe other hand, the landowner does not get the full advantage of the\r\nelasticity in rent and management that leasehold tenure makes possible,\r\nunless the tenant is a man of some substance, who can spend capital in\r\ncultivating land on a large scale, in stocking a farm with sheep and\r\ncattle, in carrying crops until the best market is found, and in making\r\nexperiments in new directions.\r\n\r\n    [401] See pp. 139-?147.\r\n\r\n    [402] See _Northumberland County History_, vol. ix., account of\r\n    Cowpen, and _Victoria County History_, Lancashire, article on\r\n    Social and Economic History. For the same reasons mills and\r\n    fisheries were naturally the first parts of a mediæval manor to\r\n    be leased for terms of years.\r\n\r\nOne can easily understand the reasons which favoured the large farm, if\r\none reflects on the change in economic environment, the outlines of\r\nwhich have been already described. The most important economic cause\r\ndetermining the unit of landholding is the nature of the crop to be\r\nraised and the methods used in producing it; and the nature of the crop\r\ndepends mainly on the conditions of the market. Now in the sixteenth\r\ncentury the market conditions were such as to leave room for a large\r\nnumber of small corn-growers, because trade was so backward that a great\r\nnumber of households farmed simply for subsistence. On the other hand,\r\neven in the case of corn-growing, the size of the most profitable unit\r\nof agriculture was increasing with the development of an internal corn\r\ntrade--a development which is proved by the strenuous attempts which the\r\nGovernment made to regulate it through the Justices of the Peace; while\r\nin the case of sheep and cattle grazing on the large scale practised by\r\nthe graziers of the period, there was obviously no question but that an\r\nextensive ranch, which could be stocked with several thousand beasts,\r\nwas the type of holding which would pay best. That a class of capitalist\r\nfarmers of this kind was coming into existence in the sixteenth century\r\nis indicated both by the complaints of contemporaries that small men\r\nfind farms taken over their heads by great graziers, who have made money\r\nin trade; by the fact that the stock and land lease, a form of metayage\r\nunder which the working capital was supplied by the landowner, had given\r\nway on many manors to the modern type of lease under which it is\r\nprovided by the lessee;[403] and by the way in which one farmer would\r\nbecome the lessee of two[404] or more manors, a clear indication of the\r\nexistence of wealthy men who had money to invest in agriculture. It was\r\nthe substitution of such a class for the small leaseholders among whom\r\nthe demesne had often been divided, and their appearance for the first\r\ntime on manors where the demesne had been kept in the hands of the lord\r\nuntil it was leased to one large farmer, which gave a rapid and almost\r\ncatastrophic speed to the tendency to enclosure which, as we have seen,\r\nwas already going on quietly among the small tenants, because it meant\r\nthe control of a growing proportion of the land by persons who had\r\ncapital to spend, and who, since they held their farms by lease, not by\r\ncopy, were under the pressure of competitive rents to adopt the methods\r\nof agriculture which were financially most profitable. This in itself\r\nwas a new phenomenon, at least on the large scale on which it appeared\r\nin the sixteenth century. In modern agriculture one is accustomed to\r\nseeing the area sown with any crop varying according to movements in the\r\nmarket price of the produce, so that on the margin of cultivation land\r\nis constantly changing its use in response to changes in the world's\r\nmarkets. But such adaptability implies a very high degree of\r\norganisation, and when farming was carried on mainly by small producers\r\nfor their own households, the reaction of changing commercial conditions\r\non the supply was much slower, and cultivation was to a much greater\r\nextent a matter of routine. It was the development of the large\r\ncapitalist farmer which supplied the link binding agriculture to the\r\nmarket and causing changes in prices to be reflected in changes in the\r\nuse to which land was put.\r\n\r\n    [403] Owing to the advantages which the small holding has for\r\n    dairy purposes (personal attention to cattle, &c.), it is still\r\n    the custom in parts of the country, _e.g._ Devonshire, for the\r\n    large farmers to sublet small dairy farms out of their holdings,\r\n    and to supply the lessee with all the stock, including the cows\r\n    and the cottage. See Levy, _Large and Small Holdings_, chap. ix.\r\n\r\n    [404] Several examples of this are to be found in the _Pembroke\r\n    Surveys_. Contemporaries called it \"the engrossing of farms.\"\r\n\r\nThe tendency which we should expect to find represented most\r\nconspicuously upon the demesne farms is of course that enclosing of land\r\nand laying of it down to pasture, which is lamented by contemporaries.\r\nThe word \"enclosing,\" under which contemporaries summed up the agrarian\r\nchanges of the period, has become the recognised name for the process by\r\nwhich the village community was broken up, but it is perhaps not a very\r\nhappy one. Quite apart from the difficulties which it raises when we\r\ncome to compare the enclosures of the eighteenth century, which were\r\nmade under Act of Parliament, with those of the sixteenth century, which\r\nwere made in defiance of legislation, it is at once too broad and too\r\nnarrow to be an adequate description even of the innovations of the\r\nearlier period, too broad if it implies that all enclosures entailed the\r\nhardships which were produced by some, too narrow if it implies that the\r\nonly hardships caused were due to enclosure. It selects one feature of\r\nthe movement towards capitalist agriculture for special emphasis, and\r\nsuggests that the hedging and ditching of land always produced similar\r\nresults. That, however, was by no means the case. Enclosure might take\r\nplace, as has been shown above, without producing the social\r\ndisturbances usually associated with it, provided that it was carried\r\nout by the tenants themselves, and with the consent of those affected.\r\nThe concentration of holdings and the displacement of tenants might take\r\nplace without enclosure. On a desert island there is no need of palings\r\nto keep out trespassers; and a manor which was entirely in the hands of\r\none great farmer was a manor where the maintenance of enclosures was\r\nalmost unnecessary. At the same time the word does describe one of the\r\nexternal features which usually accompanied the agrarian changes. The\r\ngeneral note of the movement was the emancipation from the rules of\r\ncommunal cultivation of part or all of the land used for purposes of\r\ntillage or pasture. The surface of a manor was covered with a kind of\r\nelaborate network of rules apportioning, on a common customary plan, the\r\nrights and duties of every one who had an interest in it. A man must let\r\nhis land lie open after harvest; he must not keep more than a certain\r\nnumber of each kind of beasts on the common; he must plough when his\r\nneighbours plough, and sow when his neighbours sow. The effect of the\r\ngrowing influence of the capitalist farmer was to clear away these\r\norganised restrictions from parts of the manor altogether, and violently\r\nto shake the whole system. Enclosing was normally the external symptom\r\nof the change, for the practical reason that the simplest way of cutting\r\na piece of land adrift from the common course of cultivation, or from\r\nthe rules laid down for the use of the commonable area, was to put a\r\nhedge round it, partly to keep one's own beasts in, partly to keep other\r\npeople's beasts out. The essential feature of the change was that land\r\nwhich was formerly subject to a rule prescribing the methods of\r\ncultivation became land which was used at the individual's discretion.\r\n\r\nThe agent through whom enclosing was carried out was usually the large\r\nfarmer. When the farmer leased only the demesne lands, and the demesne\r\nlands lay in large compact blocks, not in scattered strips, he could\r\nnaturally practise the new economy of enclosure upon them without\r\ncolliding with any other interest, except in the cases where they were\r\ndivided into several tenancies; while if steps were taken to get rid of\r\nthe interests which the customary tenants had either in the open fields,\r\nin the meadows, or in the common, the land lost by them was normally\r\nadded to the area which the farmer leased, and enclosed by him. In the\r\nsurveys of the period one finds manors in every stage of the transition\r\nfrom open field cultivation to enclosure, and though such individual\r\ninstances tell us nothing of the extent of the movement, they offer a\r\nvivid picture of what enclosing meant, and give the impression that\r\nenclosure had usually proceeded further on those manors where the farmer\r\nheld the largest proportion of the land. The slowness of the movement\r\ntowards enclosure on the holdings of the customary tenants has already\r\nbeen described. As a contrast to it one may look at the following table,\r\nwhich sets out the condition of things on some demesne farms:--\r\n\r\n    TABLE IX\r\n\r\n    +-----------+------------+-------------+-----------+\r\n    |           |            |             | 5         |\r\n    | Number of | No signs   | Under       | per Cent. |\r\n    | Demesne   | of         | 5 per Cent. | to 24     |\r\n    | Farms     | Enclosure. | Enclosed.   | per Cent. |\r\n    | Examined. |            |             | Enclosed. |\r\n    +-----------+------------+-------------+-----------+\r\n    | 47        | 12         | 9           | 7         |\r\n    +-----------+------------+-------------+-----------+\r\n\r\n    +-----------+------------+-------------+-----------+\r\n    | 25        | 50         | 75          |           |\r\n    | per Cent. | per Cent.  | per Cent.   | 100       |\r\n    | to 49     | to 74      | to 99       | per Cent. |\r\n    | per Cent. | per Cent.  | per Cent.   | Enclosed. |\r\n    | Enclosed. | Enclosed.  | Enclosed.   |           |\r\n    +-----------+------------+-------------+-----------+\r\n    | 7         | ...        | 4           | 8         |\r\n    +-----------+------------+-------------+-----------+\r\n\r\nThese figures are not offered as any evidence of the absolute area\r\nenclosed in the counties represented. They may, however, perhaps be\r\ntaken as an indication that the demesne farm was usually that part of\r\nthe manor on which enclosure was carried out most thoroughly. Thirty-one\r\nof the manors included in the table are in Wiltshire and Norfolk, and\r\nwhere the conditions of things on the tenants' holdings can be compared\r\nwith that obtaining on the demesne, it is almost always the case that\r\nthe new economy has spread furthest on the latter. Neither in Wiltshire\r\nnor in Norfolk had enclosure by the peasants themselves proceeded very\r\nfar in the latter half of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe conditions, however, on different manors varied so enormously that\r\nmuch weight cannot be laid on these figures, and it is both more\r\nimportant and more practicable to examine particular examples of the\r\nways in which the large enclosed estate was built up. In the first\r\nplace, then, one may say with some confidence that those parts of a\r\nmanor which lent themselves most readily to enclosing were the waste,\r\nthe common pasture, and the common meadow, while the enclosing of the\r\nfarmer's holdings of arable land took place more gradually, less\r\nthoroughly, and with greater difficulty. Thus selecting from the manors\r\ntabulated above those in which the quality of the land enclosed is\r\ndistinguished, and omitting those where it is merely stated to lie \"in\r\ncloses,\" one finds that partial or complete enclosure of the arable has\r\nbeen made on nine, of the meadow on eleven, and of the pasture on\r\ntwenty, manors. The explanation of this is to be found by recollecting\r\nthe characteristics of the organisation into which the farmer stepped.\r\nThe arable land which formed the lord's demesne was often scattered,\r\nlike the tenant's, in comparatively small plots over the three fields;\r\nunity of ownership did not by any means necessarily imply unified\r\nculture, and before these could be enclosed they had to be consolidated\r\ninto fewer and larger blocks. Moreover, if the object of enclosure was\r\nconversion to pasture, it must be remembered that the enclosure of the\r\narable implied a very great revolution in the manorial economy. A farm\r\nwhich was well equipped for tillage had barns, granges, agricultural\r\nimplements, which would stand idle if the arable land was enclosed for\r\npasture, and it was therefore natural that, as long as other land was\r\navailable in sufficient quantities for sheep-farming, such land should\r\nbe enclosed for the purpose, before the ordinary course of cultivation\r\non the arable land was abandoned. The common meadows and the common\r\nwastes did not offer these obstacles to enclosure. Since the\r\nindividualising tendencies of personal cultivation did not operate upon\r\nthese parts of the village land, the method of securing equal enjoyment\r\nof them had not been, as in the case of arable, to give each household a\r\nholding consisting of separate strips scattered over good and bad land\r\nalike, but to give each holder of an arable share access to the whole of\r\nthe pasture land. They were, therefore, usually not divided and\r\nscattered to anything like the same extent, and it was thus much easier\r\nfor the rights of different parties over them to be disentangled, and\r\nfor the land to be cut up and enclosed \"in severalty.\" Hence, where the\r\ntenants are most numerous, and where there are fewest signs of change,\r\nthe effect of the large farmer is often seen in the withdrawal of part\r\nof the common waste from communal use. If the growth of sheep farming\r\nmade the small tenants anxious, as in many cases it did, to acquire\r\nseparate pastures for their flocks, it can readily be understood that\r\nthe large farmer, who had more to lose and more to gain, was likely to\r\npursue the same policy unless checked by organised opposition. Normally\r\nthe change seems to have taken place by converting the right to pasture\r\na certain number of beasts in common with other tenants into the right\r\nto the exclusive use of a certain number of acres. Instead of the whole\r\ncommonable area lying open to a number of animals \"stinted\" in a certain\r\nproportion among the commoners, the stint is abandoned, and the basis of\r\nallocation is found not in a fixed number of animals, but in a fixed\r\narea of land, which forms the separate common of the individual farmer,\r\nand which is naturally enclosed. Many examples of this division of\r\ncommonable land are found in the surveys, especially in connection with\r\nthe common waste of the manor, which enable us to trace the change from\r\ncollective to individual administration. Thus, to give a few instances,\r\nat Winterbourne Basset[405] the farmer has all the meadow land except\r\none half-acre, and a separate close of 140 acres on the downs, where he\r\ncan graze nearly three times as many sheep as all the customary tenants.\r\nAt Knyghton[406] he has enclosed with a hedge part of the sheep's\r\ncommon, no sheep at all being kept by the customary tenants. At\r\nMassingham,[407] in Norfolk, where much of the demesne arable lies \"in\r\nthe fields,\" there is an enclosed pasture containing 123-1/2 acres; and\r\non another farm of 203 acres, which has apparently been formed out of\r\nthe demesne, one finds 28 acres of arable \"in the fields\" and 65 acres\r\nof \"pasture enclosed,\" the remaining 80 acres lying \"in the sheep\r\ncourses.\" The best picture of what the change meant is given by the two\r\nmaps[408] printed opposite. In No. III. the meadow, save for a small\r\npiece used exclusively by All Souls, is common, each tenant presumably\r\nbeing allowed to place so many beasts upon it. In No. IV. the meadow has\r\nbeen divided up among the tenants, and instead of pasturing a limited\r\nnumber of beasts on the whole of it, each can pasture as many beasts as\r\nhe pleases on part of it. It is not necessary to point out the\r\nsignificance of this change from the point of view of the social\r\norganisation of rural life. It means that communal administration of\r\npart of the land has been abandoned and its place taken by use at the\r\ndiscretion of the individual tenant.\r\n\r\n    [405] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Lands of William, First Earl\r\n    of Pembroke_. The farmer has four closes of meadow amounting to\r\n    9 acres, one meadow of 2-1/2 acres, one meadow of 7 acres, one\r\n    meadow of 8-1/2 acres. In addition to that and the hilly\r\n    pasture, there is in his possession \"unus campus noviter\r\n    inclusus, qui aliquando seminatur, aliquando iacet ad pasturam,\"\r\n    and which \"olim sustentare potuit 900 oves et catalla non\r\n    extenta.\"\r\n\r\n    [406] _Ibid._, \"De terra montanea unde pars includitur cum sepe\r\n    iuxta Crowcheston continens per estimationem 100 acres, et\r\n    custodire potest supra prædictam 900 oves.\" Sometimes it is\r\n    expressly stated that the farmer alone is to have a certain\r\n    pasture, _e.g._ at Chalke (_ibid_): \"Et etiam dictus firmarius\r\n    habet ibidem unum montem vocatum a Doune et bene cognitum est\r\n    quia circumcinctum est per sepem et bundas, et custodire potest\r\n    600 multones quia nullus habet communiam in eo nisi firmarius\r\n    solus, et continet per estimacionem 200 acres.\"\r\n\r\n    [407] R.O. Rentals and Surveys, Gen. Ser., Portf. 24, No. 4, f.\r\n    46 (_temp._ Hen. VIII.). \"The fold course will carry 1800 sheep\r\n    at £8 a hundred.\"\r\n\r\n    [408] In All Souls' Muniment Room.\r\n\r\nBut while the pasture ground and meadow offered special facilities for\r\nenclosure, there is abundant evidence that the farmer's arable land was\r\nalso in many cases enclosed. On some manors the whole of the arable\r\ndemesne lay together, and in that case there was no obstacle in the way\r\nof enclosing it. More usually it lay in three pieces, one block in each\r\nof the three great fields, and here again, when there was sufficient\r\nmotive for enclosure, enclosure was easily practicable. The only\r\narrangement which offered a really difficult problem was that in which\r\nit was divided into acre and a half strips scattered about the manor at\r\na distance from each other. One finds cases in which such strips\r\nnumbered several hundred, but the impression given by surveys is that,\r\nat any rate by the middle of the sixteenth century, such extreme\r\nsubdivision was exceptional, and that the consolidation of holdings by\r\nmeans of exchange and purchase, which we have seen at work from an early\r\ndate on the holdings of the customary tenants, had often proceeded so\r\nfar on the demesne as to have rounded off the farmer's property into\r\ncomparatively few large holdings. As an illustration of the first steps\r\ntowards unification and enclosure we may take the manor of Sparham,[409]\r\nin Norfolk, which was surveyed about 1590. Here the 189 acres which\r\ncompose the demesne, and which are leased to a farmer, are still much\r\nscattered. They lie in seventy different pieces, most of which are quite\r\nsmall, acres, half-acres, and roods. But even here there has been a\r\nconsiderable amount of consolidation, and it has been followed by the\r\nbeginnings of enclosure. The 37-1/2 acres of pasture lie in five pieces\r\nof 11, 9, 7, 5, 5-1/2 acres, all of which have been enclosed. The arable\r\nis still intermixed with the strips of the other tenants in the open\r\nfields. But on the arable itself consolidation and enclosure are\r\ncreeping forward. There are four strips lying together which comprise\r\n6-3/4 acres. There is one enclosure, consisting of arable, wood, and\r\nmeadow, and containing 17 acres. The neighbouring manor of\r\nFulmordeston[410] offers an example of a state of things in which the\r\nsame tendency has worked itself out to completion. The 742 acres leased\r\nby the farmer of the demesne are entirely enclosed. There are two woods\r\ncomprising 50 acres. There is an enclosure of 250 acres, 35 perches,\r\nconsisting of \"Corne severall and Broome severall.\" There is a \"great\r\nclose\" of 130 acres, 1 rood, \"longe close\" of 57 acres, 3 roods, \"Brick\r\nkyll close\" of 40 acres, 1 rood, \"Brakehill close\" of 24 acres, 1 rood,\r\na field of 106 acres called Hestell, and another of 83 acres, 2 roods.\r\nBut these different stages are best illustrated by maps[411] Nos. I.,\r\nIII., IV., V., and VI.\r\n\r\nOn No. III. it will be seen that there is a good deal of subdivision. On\r\nNos. IV. and V. the tenants whose strips separated parts of the demesne\r\nfrom each other, have in many cases dropped out, so that the process of\r\naggregation is facilitated: on No. I. the concentration of the demesne\r\ninto a single large block is complete; though it is still unenclosed, it\r\noffers no obstacle to enclosure: on No. VI. consolidation has\r\nbeen followed by enclosure, conversion to pasture and depopulation.\r\nBetween the state of things on map No. III. and that on map No. VI.\r\nthere is the greatest possible difference. Yet there is no reason to\r\ndoubt that Whadborough had once been an open field village with tenants\r\nwho were mainly engaged in tillage. Map Nos. IV., V., and I. are, as it\r\nwere, the intervening chapters which join the preface to the conclusion.\r\nOccasionally one can see the process of consolidation, which was the\r\nnecessary preliminary of enclosure, actually taking place. At\r\nHarriesham,[412] in Kent, the parson held 3 acres of glebe land in two\r\npieces, one of them lying in the middle of a field belonging to another\r\ntenant, who ploughed up its boundaries and added it to his own land.\r\nAccordingly, to prevent uncertainty in the future, the owner of the\r\nfield and the parson executed a deed by which the latter surrendered his\r\nclaim to the detached pieces of land, and in return got three acres laid\r\nout in a single plot. In view of the large blocks which are often held\r\nby the farmer of the demesne, one cannot doubt that such consolidation\r\nby way of exchange must have been a common arrangement.\r\n\r\n    [409] MSS. of the Earl of Leicester at Holkham, Sparham\r\n    Documents, Bdle.

The\r\ninterpretation of both of these sets of statistics is ambiguous. Mr.\r\nLeadam uses them to show that much enclosing took place for arable, and\r\nthat therefore the statutes and writers of the period exaggerated the\r\nmovement towards pasture farming. Professor Gay thinks his conclusions\r\nuntenable, and that a proper interpretation of the Commissioners'\r\nreturns corroborates the view of contemporary writers that pasture was\r\nsubstituted for tillage on a large scale. Two points emerge pretty\r\nclearly from the controversy. The first is that there was a good deal of\r\nredistribution of land with the object of better tillage, of the kind\r\nwhich has been described above, and that probably the fact that the word\r\n\"enclosure\" was used to describe this, as well as the conversion of\r\narable to pasture, was responsible for some confusion. The second is\r\nthat the predominant tendency was towards sheep-farming. To suppose that\r\ncontemporaries were mistaken as to the general nature of the movement is\r\nto accuse them of an imbecility which is really incredible. Governments\r\ndo not go out of their way to offend powerful classes out of mere\r\nlightheartedness, nor do large bodies of men revolt because they have\r\nmistaken a ploughed field for a sheep pasture. Even if we accept Mr.\r\nLeadam's statistical analysis of the report of the Commission of 1517,\r\nhis figures still reveal a great deal of conversion to pasture; and it\r\nis clear that many cases on which his totals rest are open to more than\r\none interpretation.\r\n\r\n    [413] Leadam, _Domesday of Enclosures_. For a discussion as to\r\n    whether they suggest that enclosing took place for arable or\r\n    pasture, see _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, New Series, vol. xiv.\r\n\r\n    [414] _Quarterly Journal of Economics_, vol. xi.\r\n\r\nIf the general correctness of the view of the sixteenth century\r\nobservers that there was a wide movement towards sheep-farming is\r\naccepted, it ought to be represented more fully on the demesne farms\r\nthan elsewhere, because changes could be applied to them with much less\r\nfriction than to the lands in which the interests of other tenants were\r\ninvolved. With a view to showing to what extent this is the case two\r\nsets of figures are given below; the first is a table taken from Dr.\r\nSavine's[415] work on _The English Monasteries on the Eve of the\r\nReformation_, and relates to the demesne lands of forty-one monasteries\r\nwhich were surveyed for the Crown on the occasion of their surrender;\r\nsome were apparently in the hands of the monastery and some apparently\r\nwere leased. The second gives the approximate use to which land was put\r\nby the farmers of the demesnes on forty-nine manors in the sixteenth and\r\nearly seventeenth centuries. They are subdivided in three groups, (_a_)\r\nmanors in Norfolk and Suffolk, (_b_) manors in Wiltshire and Dorsetshire\r\n(one), and (_c_) manors in other southern and eastern counties, but\r\nincluding one in Staffordshire and one in Lancashire. For purposes of\r\ncomparison the table given in Part I.

of land between different uses is not\r\nfar wrong. Of the customary tenants' land about 87 per cent. is arable,\r\nand 12 per cent. meadow and pasture. Of the farmers' land about 49 per\r\ncent. is arable, 36 per cent. pasture, 9 per cent. meadow. The\r\nproportion of pasture to arable is somewhat higher in the southern and\r\nmidland counties than it is in East Anglia; but the cases examined are\r\ntoo few to allow of any conclusion being drawn from this fact. Without\r\npushing the figures in either table further than they will go, one may\r\nsuggest that they seem to imply, in the first place, that the large\r\nfarmer was by no means always a grazier, and that the writers of the\r\nperiod who spoke as though all large-scale farming meant the conversion\r\nof arable to pasture were guilty of some exaggeration. In a good many\r\ncases the methods of cultivation pursued by the farmer of the demesne\r\ndiffered from those of the customary tenants only in the fact that his\r\nholding was larger; as a matter of fact the customary tenants on some\r\nmanors deserve the name of grazier better than the farmer of the demesne\r\nupon others.\r\n\r\nBut they suggest, in the second place, that these cases were\r\nexceptional, and that, on the whole, arable farming played a much more\r\nimportant part on the holdings of the customary tenants than it did on\r\nthose of the farmers. The former subsisted mainly on the tillage of the\r\nland in the open fields. The latter, though they had often much arable,\r\nsometimes had none, or next to none at all, and relied to a far greater\r\nextent on the opportunities for stock-breeding offered by pasture and\r\nmeadow land. These figures, however, include some derived from manors\r\nwhere tillage was virtually the only sort of farming carried on, and\r\nthey do not give any idea of the arrangements prevailing on an estate\r\nwhere pasture-farming had been pushed far. Taking from the fifty manors\r\ndealt with above, the twelve which are most typical of the new régime,\r\none gets a very different picture--\r\n\r\n    TABLE XI\r\n\r\n    +------------+---------+---------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n    |            |         |         |          |         |   Other   |\r\n    | Land Held. | Arable. | Meadow. | Pasture. | Closes. |(Wood, &c.)|\r\n    +------------+---------+---------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n    |   Acres.   |  Acres. |  Acres. |  Acres.  |  Acres. |   Acres.  |\r\n    |    4474    |   922   |   403   |   3065   |    71   |     13    |\r\n    |            | (20.6%) |  (8.9%) | (68.3%)  |  (1.5%) |           |\r\n    +------------+---------+---------+----------+---------+-----------+\r\n\r\nHere arable forms only 23 per cent. of the whole area, while pasture and\r\nmeadow together form over 77 per cent. This swing of the pendulum from\r\narable husbandry to pasture-farming will not surprise us, if we remember\r\nthat at the time of the Domesday Survey, and, indeed, throughout the\r\nMiddle Ages, the area of land under the plough had been, when considered\r\nin relation to the population, extraordinarily large. The economic\r\njustification of ploughing land which no modern farmer would touch had\r\nlain in the fact that the impossibility of moving food supplies had made\r\nit necessary for each village to be virtually self-supporting, and had\r\nthus prevented the specialisation of districts in different types of\r\nagriculture. When the development of trade under the Tudors had combined\r\nwith the keen demand for wool to introduce a geographical division of\r\nlabour, the change was naturally all the more violent, because there\r\nwas, so to speak, so much lee-way to be made up, because so much land\r\nwas in tillage which had no special suitability for the production of\r\ngrain. Even so, between 1815 and 1846, the rich water meadows of\r\nOxfordshire were being ploughed up for corn. Even so, after 1879, the\r\ncollapse of corn-growing was all the more disastrous, because it had\r\nbeen so long delayed.\r\n\r\nOne would expect the growth of large farms side by side with the\r\ncustomary holdings, especially when the methods of agriculture employed\r\nwere so different, to result in a powerful reaction of the new interests\r\nupon the old, and perhaps in a collision between them, even when no\r\ndeliberate attempt was made to alter the position of the tenants. And\r\nthis is what we are told in fact occurred. The customary tenants'\r\nholdings and the demesne both formed part of one area, subject to\r\ncertain rights and privileges defined by the custom of the manor. Both,\r\nfor example, would lie open to the village cattle after harvest; both\r\nwere subject to the customary rotation of crops, and necessarily so when\r\nthe demesne was not separate but mixed with the customary holdings in\r\nthe open field; both had rights of common on the pasture or waste of the\r\nmanor. Moreover, the whole organisation of the economic side of manorial\r\nlife was based on the assumption that tillage was the most important\r\nelement in it. For example, the apportionment of rights over the waste,\r\nthe \"stint\" of animals to be grazed, assumed that no one partner would\r\nrequire to graze more than a certain number, and broke down if he gave\r\nhimself up to cattle-breeding or sheep-farming, and multiplied his\r\nbeasts by five or ten. It would be natural, therefore, to look for a\r\nstraining and shifting of those rights as a probable consequence of the\r\nexistence side by side of two such different agricultural stages, and of\r\nsuch different types of property. Formerly the respective interests of\r\nthe lord and the customary tenants had been harmonised by the fact that\r\nthe labour of the latter supplied the chief means of cultivating the\r\ndemesne, and that the demesne could hardly be a profitable concern if\r\nthe number of tenants or their standard of living declined very largely,\r\nany more than a gold-mine can pay without gold-miners. But when the\r\ndemesne was largely used for pasture this consideration of course did\r\nnot apply, and in any case by the sixteenth century, although the\r\nservices of the tenants were still part of the means by which the\r\nfarmers found labour, they were probably an unimportant one. As is shown\r\nby the smallness of the holdings on many manors, which were quite\r\ninsufficient by themselves to support a family, and by the evidence of\r\ncontemporaries, the farmer had a growing, though still small, labour\r\nmarket into which to dip, and the rough agreement which had existed\r\nbetween the interests of the manorial estate and those of the tenants\r\nwas therefore no longer existent. Thus a collision of interests, a\r\nweakening of communal restrictions before the enterprise of the\r\ncapitalist farmer, the strengthening of some kinds of property and the\r\nweakening of others, and the growth of new sorts of social relations in\r\nthe villages, were consequences to be expected from the increasing\r\npredominance of the large farm, and especially of the large pasture\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the arguments of the chapter. At the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century forces both political--the restriction of the\r\nterritorial sovereignty of the landlords--and economic--the growth in\r\nthe demand for wool--were working to produce a change in the methods of\r\nagriculture; and at any rate by the middle of the century another\r\npowerful motive was added by the fall in the value of money. The result\r\nwas that there was a movement in the direction of converting arable land\r\nto pasture, and of enclosure, which affected all classes of landholders,\r\nbut which was carried furthest by the large farmers who leased the\r\ndemesne lands of manors, who could afford to make experiments, and who\r\nwere under a strong incentive to turn the land to its most profitable\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE REACTION OF THE AGRARIAN CHANGES ON THE PEASANTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) _The Removing of Landmarks_\r\n\r\nThe history of the agrarian problem in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies--indeed its history ever since--is largely the story of the\r\nsmall cultivator's struggle to protect his interests against the changes\r\ncaused by the growth of the great estate. In that struggle there is much\r\nthat is detailed, tiresome, and obscure. The student hears very little\r\nabout general principles, very much of technicalities about the nature\r\nof common appendant and common appurtenant, of stinted and unstinted\r\npastures, of gressums and fines, of copyholds for years, for lives, or\r\nof inheritance, of land which is old enclosure that ought to stand, or\r\nnew enclosure that ought to fall. But at the centre of this maze of dry\r\nand infinitely diverse details there is a real regrouping of social\r\nforces going on, and a rearrangement, at once rapid and profound, of\r\neconomic and political ideas. We must no more picture the changes of our\r\nperiod as mere matters of the technique of agriculture, than we must\r\nthink of the industrial revolution of two centuries later in terms of\r\nspinning-jennies and steam-power. On the contrary, these very details\r\nare the channel along which rural life is beginning to slip from one\r\nform of economic organisation to another, the seed-plot in which new\r\nconceptions of social expediency are being brought to maturity. In\r\nnumberless English villages between 1500 and 1600 large issues are being\r\ndecided which will profoundly modify the course of social development.\r\nIs the communal administration of meadow and wastes to survive (as it\r\nhas survived in France and Belgium) or is it to disappear? Is England\r\nto be a country of large cultivators working with many hired labourers,\r\nor of small cultivators working with few? Is leasehold or copyhold to be\r\nthe predominant form of land tenure? When the final transition to modern\r\nagriculture takes place, will England face the change with a population\r\nthe bulk of which has been rooted in the soil since the Middle Ages, or\r\nwill the middle classes in rural society have been already so far\r\nundermined that opinion turns spontaneously to the great landlord as the\r\nsole representative of agricultural progress? Of course the answer to\r\nthese questions was not given by 1600 or even by 1700; we must not\r\nforget Arthur Young and the far more extensive enclosures of the\r\neighteenth century. But in our period development certainly took a\r\ndistinct bias away from one set of arrangements and in the direction of\r\nanother. The best standpoint from which to examine its course is found\r\nby watching the reaction upon the tenants of the agricultural changes\r\nwhich we have tried to summarise in the preceding sections.\r\n\r\nThe economic effect of the policy pursued by the large farmer depended\r\nupon what proportion of the land he controlled, and in particular upon\r\nthe part of the manor upon which enclosure was made. He might enclose\r\nonly the land actually belonging to the demesne farm when he took it\r\nover; or he might enclose parts of the waste or meadow over which other\r\ntenants had rights of pasture; or he might enclose the holdings in the\r\nopen arable fields belonging to other tenants, for this purpose\r\nevicting, or inducing the lord to evict, them. When only the demesne\r\nlands were enclosed the other interests were sometimes little disturbed,\r\nunless indeed the demesne had already been parcelled out among some of\r\nthe smaller tenants, a contingency to be considered later. But, even\r\nwhen that was not the case, the conversion of the demesne to pasture and\r\nits enclosure had two consequences which were not unimportant. On the\r\none hand, the wage-earning population of cottagers and younger sons, who\r\nhad found employment as hired labourers when the demesne was used for\r\ntillage, were thrown out of work, and with the limited demand for labour\r\noffered by a sixteenth century village, were obliged, one would\r\nsuppose, to join the armies of tramps who figure so largely in the pages\r\nof the writers of the period. As the bailiffs accounts of some manors\r\nshow, the demesne farm had sometimes employed a quite considerable staff\r\nof workmen of different kinds, and though no clear instance of a\r\nreduction of the number of employees, consequent on the transition to\r\npasture farming, has come to light, one can occasionally compare the\r\ndemand for labour under the old régime and under the new in a way which\r\ndoes something to substantiate the lamentations of contemporaries.[416]\r\nIt is this which gives point to their complaints as to the decay of\r\n\"hospitality.\" Hospitality in the sixteenth century does not merely mean\r\na general attitude of open-handed friendliness. When the Government\r\nintervenes to enjoin hospitality, we are not to think that, even in that\r\nage of grandmotherly legislation, it is going out of its way to insist\r\nthat every man shall provide his neighbour with a glass of beer and a\r\nbed for the night. Hospitality has a quite precise meaning and a quite\r\ndefinite social importance. It is, in the most literal sense,\r\nhousekeeping, and the household does not merely imply what we mean by\r\n\"the family,\" a group of persons connected by blood but pursuing often\r\nquite separate occupations, and, except in the small number of cases\r\nwhere property owned by the head of the family supplies a financial\r\nbasis for unity, possessing quite separate economic interests. It is, on\r\nthe contrary, a miniature co-operative society, housed under one roof,\r\ndependent upon one industry, and including not only man and wife and\r\nchildren, but servants and labourers, ploughmen and threshers, cowherds\r\nand milkmaids, who live together, work together, and play together, just\r\nas one can see them doing in parts of Norway and Switzerland at the\r\npresent day. When the economic foundations of this small organism are\r\nswept away by a change in the method of farming, the effect is not\r\nmerely to ruin a family, it is to break up a business. It is analogous\r\nnot to the unemployment of an individual householder, but to the\r\nbankruptcy of a firm.\r\n\r\n    [416] The Shepe Book of Tittleshall Manor (Holkham MSS.,\r\n    Tittleshall Books, No. 19), shows flocks of 500 to 1000 sheep\r\n    being managed by a single shepherd, 1543?-1549.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, even when they lost nothing else, the rest of the\r\nlandholding population was deprived of some of the rights of grazing\r\nwhich they had exercised on the enclosed arable after harvest. If the\r\ndemesne formed a large proportion of the whole area of the village, or\r\nif there was little other pasture, their loss, as the frequent\r\ncomplaints of interference with \"shack\"[417] prove, might be a very\r\nconsiderable one; for it meant that there might be no means of feeding\r\nsome proportion of the village beasts. Moreover, the mere presence of a\r\nlarge capitalist who controlled a great part of the land, and converted\r\nit to pasture or retained it as arable according to the price of wool\r\nand wheat, prejudiced them in various indirect ways. The farmer of the\r\ndemesne seems at an early date to have had a bad name for hard dealings.\r\nHe was often a stranger, and therefore indifferent to the influence of\r\nlocal customs and personal relationships. Where the manoral officials\r\nhad offered direct employment, he was a middleman with a high rent to\r\npay, and, like most middlemen, a channel for pressure without\r\nresponsibility. As the largest shareholder in the small agricultural\r\ncommunity, he could disturb its arrangements by altering his course of\r\ncultivation, and, since he was the representative of the lord, he could\r\nnot easily be checked. Sometimes, indeed, a clause was inserted in his\r\nlease expressly providing that he should not disturb the neighbouring\r\npeasants.[418] But there are many cases in which there is no mention of\r\nformal enclosing, and in which, nevertheless, it is complained that the\r\nfarmer persistently molests and harries the customary tenants. It was\r\nthe essence of the open field system of agriculture--at once its\r\nstrength and its weakness--that its maintenance reposed upon a common\r\ncustom and tradition, not upon documentary records capable of precise\r\nconstruction. Its boundaries were often rather a question of the degree\r\nof conviction with which ancient inhabitants could be induced to affirm\r\nthem, than visible to the mere eye of sense, and their indefiniteness\r\nmade the way of the transgressor extremely easy. Even the lord of the\r\nmanor sometimes found the large farmer too much for his vigilance. \"John\r\nLangford and his ancesters,\" the College of All Souls petitioned in\r\nChancery in 1637, \"have for many yeares by vertue of several demises\r\nfarmed and rented of your oratours their said messuage and lands, and\r\nused and occupied the same with their own lands, and during the time of\r\nsuch occupation have pulled up, destroyed and removed, the metes, mere\r\nlonds, and boundaries of your oratours their said lands, and confounded\r\nthe same so that the same cannot be set forth.... Mr. Langford's lands\r\nand grounds lying next adjoining unto the said oratours their\r\ngrounds,... the said John Langford hath extended his said cottages,\r\norchards, gardens, and curtilages thereunto belonging, to your oratours\r\ntheir said grounds, and hath made hedges, ditches, fences and mounds\r\nwherein and whereby he hath enclosed your oratours their said grounds\r\nunto his own cottages and land, ... and intendeth so ... to keep from\r\nyour orators all the said land so encroached and enclosed.\"[419] When a\r\nfarmer would thus calmly expropriate the lord of the manor, it is not\r\nsurprising to find constant small disputes between him and the other\r\ntenants, on the ground of his entering upon their holdings, or\r\n\"surcharging the fieldes by waye of intercommon and destroying the corn\r\nof greane by drifte of cattle over the common of fieldes and suche\r\nother.\"[420] Often, no doubt, the sporadic encroachments which provoked\r\nquarrels with the other tenants appeared to the great grazier a natural\r\nexercise of his obvious rights. Who should say where one man's land\r\nbegan and another's ended? But it can hardly be doubted that such\r\nirregularities were sometimes a deliberate attempt to worry the weaker\r\nmembers of the village community into throwing up their lands, by making\r\nprofitable cultivation impossible. \"If any man do sow any ground,\" ran\r\nthe direction given by a lord to the shepherd who looked after the\r\ndemesne farm on a Suffolk manor, \"and the stifts of the field are\r\nbroken, and may not duly be taken and fed as heretofore they have been\r\nused, then the said Tillot to feed off the said corn and drive his sheep\r\non that part of the ploughed land, and to forbid any particular man to\r\nsow his ground or any part thereof whereby the sheep-walks may be\r\nhindered.\"[421] Such an order points to the difficulty of adjusting the\r\ndifferent methods of cultivation pursued by the smaller tenants and on\r\nthe demesne. Though the complaints of the former were often indefinite\r\nenough, it is probable that the very difficulty of defining what a large\r\ncapitalist might or might not do was in itself a substantial grievance.\r\nThe truth is that it was not easy for the great pasture farm, with its\r\nflocks of sheep, to subsist side by side with the smaller arable\r\nholdings of the other tenants, without a good deal of friction arising,\r\neven in those cases in which no deliberate attempt was made to evict the\r\nlatter or to deprive them of their rights of common. The traditional\r\norganisation of agriculture was based on the assumption that much the\r\nsame methods of utilising the land would be followed by all the tenants.\r\nWhen that assumption broke down with the growth of large-scale\r\nsheep-farming, there was naturally a collision of interests between the\r\ngreat men who made innovations and the small men who adhered to the\r\ncustomary rule.\r\n\r\n    [417] _e.g._ Holkham MSS., Fulmordeston, Bdle. 6: \"To the Right\r\n    Honourable Sir Edward Cooke, Knight, Attorney General unto the\r\n    King's Ma{tie}. Humblie sheweth unto your lordship yo{r} poore\r\n    and dayley orators ... yo{r} worshippes tenants of the Manor of\r\n    Fulmordeston cum Croxton in the Duchie of Lancaster, and the\r\n    moste parte of the tenants of the same manor that whereas your\r\n    said orators in the Hillary Terme last commenced suite in the\r\n    Duchie Courte against Thomas Odbert and Roger Salisbury, gent.,\r\n    who have enclosed their grounds contrary to the custom of the\r\n    manor, wherby your wor. loseth your shack due out of the\r\n    grounds, common lane or way for passengers is stopped up, and\r\n    your worshipps' poore orators lose their accustomed shack in\r\n    those grounds, and the said Roger Salisbury taketh also the\r\n    whole benefit of theire common from them, keepinge there his\r\n    sheepe in grazinge, and debarring them of their libertie there\r\n    which for comon right belongeth unto them.\" For the rest of this\r\n    document see Appendix I., and compare the following defence to a\r\n    charge of breaking open an enclosure: \"The owners of the said\r\n    tenements, from time whereof there is no memory to the contrary,\r\n    have had a common of pasture for themselves and their tenants in\r\n    one close commonly called 'the new leasue,' in the lordship of\r\n    Weston in the manner following; that is to say, when the field\r\n    where the said 'leasue' doth lie, called Radnor field, lieth\r\n    fallow, then through the whole year; and when the said field is\r\n    sown with corn, then from the reaping and carrying away of the\r\n    corn until the same be sown again ... and the said Thomas Dodd\r\n    further said that he did break open the said close ... being\r\n    fenced in such time as he ought to have common in the same, to\r\n    the end that his cattle might take their pasture therein\"\r\n    (_William Salt Collection_, New Series, vol. ix., Chancery\r\n    Proceedings, Bdle. 8, No. 9).\r\n\r\n    [418] For complaints of tenants against the exactions, of\r\n    farmers as early as 1413, see _Victoria County History_, Essex,\r\n    vol. ii. p. 318. For a stipulation in the farmer's covenant, see\r\n    the following: \"Item a covenant conteyned in this lease that the\r\n    said Thomas shall permit and suffer the customary Tenants\r\n    peaceably to have and enjoy their estates, rights, grants,\r\n    interests, and premises, without any lette, interruption, or\r\n    contradiction of the said Thomas\" (Roxburghe Club, _Pembroke\r\n    Surveys_, Knyghton); and _Northumberland County History_, vol.\r\n    v. p. 208, Buston: \"The tenants of this town at the beginning of\r\n    summer have their oxen allway grazed in Shilbottel wood, or else\r\n    they were not able to maintain their tenements. It is therefore\r\n    requisite that his lordship or his heire should have respect\r\n    unto the want of pasture, that in any lease made by his lordship\r\n    or his heire to any person of the pasture, the said Shilbottel\r\n    wood, there might be a proviso in the said lease that the said\r\n    tenants should have their oxen ground there, as they have been\r\n    accustomed.\" Instances of the harrying of the peasants by the\r\n    large farmers are to be found, _ibid._, vol. i. p. 350\r\n    (Tughall), and p. 274 (Newham).\r\n\r\n    [419] All Souls' Archives, vol. i. p. 203, No. 356.\r\n\r\n    [420] _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i., Survey of Mudford\r\n    and Hinton. In this case the aggressor was not the farmer of the\r\n    demesne, but a freeholder owning a third of the manor. To escape\r\n    his depredations the tenants proposed \"to enclose their common\r\n    fieldes and to assign to Master Lyte and his tenants his third\r\n    parte in every field by itself, and to extinguish his right of\r\n    common in the rest.\"\r\n\r\n    [421] _Victoria County History_, Suffolk, \"Social and Economic\r\n    History.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) _The Struggle for the Commons_\r\n\r\nBut sporadic encroachments are not the worst which the small man has to\r\nfear. He may wake to find the path along which he drives his beasts to\r\npasture blocked by a hedge. When he goes to renew his lease or buy the\r\nreversion of his copy, he may be told that his holding is to be merged\r\nin a pasture farm. The great estate is not always built up by the mere\r\nconsolidation of pieces of land which are already united in ownership,\r\nthough spatially they may be separate. If it were there would be few\r\nstatutes and few riots; for the law looks with a favourable eye on such\r\nattempts at improved cultivation, and the peasants have long been doing\r\non a small scale what the capitalist farmer does on a large. The great\r\nestate is formed in another and less innocent way, by throwing together\r\nholdings whose possession is separate, though spatially they may be\r\ncontiguous. It is the result of addition, not simply of organisation; of\r\naddition in which the cyphers are the holdings of numerous small\r\ntenants. In such a process the opposition between the interests of the\r\npeasantry and those of the manorial authorities is brought to a head. If\r\none man is to run a hedge round a pasture, the pasture must first be\r\nstripped of the rights of common which enmesh it. If sheep are to be fed\r\non the sites of ruined cottages, their occupants must first be evicted.\r\nIt is over the absorption of commons and the eviction of tenants that\r\nagrarian warfare--the expression is not too modern or too strong--is\r\nwaged in the sixteenth century. Let us look at both these movements more\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\nThe obscurity to one age of the everyday economic arrangements of\r\nanother is excellently illustrated by the difficulty of appreciating the\r\npart which common rights played in English husbandry before the\r\nnineteenth century. It is not so long since it became a memory. There\r\nare villages where the old men still remember--how could they forget\r\nit?--the year when the commons finally \"went in.\" Yet there is hardly a\r\nfeature in the plain man's view of the nature of a common which\r\ncorresponds to the reality as it was used by our ancestors, and as it is\r\nused to-day by communities whose land system has followed a different\r\ncourse of development from our own. He thinks of a common as land which,\r\nlike a municipal park, \"belongs to the public,\" land which any one may\r\nuse and any one abuse. In the innocence of his heart he will even move\r\nhis local authority to put in a claim for its possession, and is very\r\nmuch surprised when its solicitors tell him that he is fighting for the\r\nrights of two or three mouldy tenements. Again, he thinks of a common as\r\na place of fresh air and recreation, not of business; as land for which,\r\nat the moment, no serious economic use can be found; unprofitable\r\nscraps, whose ineligibility has secured them a precarious immunity from\r\npark-loving squires and speculative builders. In connection with\r\nagriculture he thinks of it not at all--is not waste land the opposite\r\nof land which is under cultivation? In one respect he is right. Our\r\nexisting commons are remnants--remnants which have survived the deluge\r\nof eighteenth century Private Acts, mainly because they consist of land\r\ntoo poor to pay counsel's fees. In all other respects he is wrong. In\r\nthe earlier period the word common implied common exclusiveness quite as\r\nmuch as common enjoyment. The value of a common to the commoners\r\nconsisted precisely in the guarantee given them by custom that no one\r\nmight use it except holders of tenements which time out of mind had a\r\nright thereto, and that no man might use it to a greater extent than the\r\ncustom of the manor allowed. And the modern man is especially wrong in\r\nregarding commons as though they fell below the margin of economic\r\nemployment. Commons and common rights, so far from being merely a luxury\r\nor a convenience, were really an integral and indispensable part of the\r\nsystem of agriculture, a linch pin, the removal of which brought the\r\nwhole structure of village society tumbling down.\r\n\r\nNo one who reads the petitions and the legal proceedings of our period\r\ncan doubt that this was what the small cultivator felt. No one who\r\nconsults the surveyors can doubt that he was right. Yet, at first sight,\r\nthe importance attached to commons is certainly surprising. Is not the\r\noutcry disproportionate to the grievance? To riot and rebel when you\r\nlose grazing rights--is not this, it may be asked, rather like shooting\r\nyour landlord because he will not let you keep poultry? The answer is\r\nperhaps a twofold one. The peasants' economy in the sixteenth century\r\nwas one in which, in many parts of England, the pastoral side of\r\nagriculture played a very important rôle, and for which, therefore,\r\nabundance of pasture land was very essential. As any one who has lived\r\nin a Swiss châlet knows, a family which has sufficient cattle and goats\r\non a good mountain can, during half the year, be almost self-sufficing.\r\nIt has milk, butter, cheese, eggs, and meat. The only thing it really\r\nmisses is bread, and that it has the means of purchasing, even if it\r\ndoes not, like the sensible people of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and\r\nprobably of most parts of England before the industrial revolution, bake\r\nits own supplies at home or in a common public oven. Our sixteenth\r\ncentury peasants do not keep goats, but they keep a great many horses\r\nand cows, on some manors an average of 6 or 8 per holding; they keep a\r\ngreat many sheep, sometimes 150 or 200 each; they meet depressions in\r\nthe corn trade by falling back on other sides of agriculture, and\r\nsending to market miscellaneous produce which, in a time of rising\r\nprices, sells well. But to do this successfully they must have plenty of\r\ngrazing land. A Swiss commune measures its wealth very largely by the\r\nquality of its pasture, and will take pains to buy a good one, even\r\nthough it be a long distance from the village.[422] Can we doubt that\r\nthe same was true of many parts of England, and that Hales' husbandmen\r\nwho \"could never be able to make up my lordes rent weare it not for a\r\nlittle brede of neate, shepe, swine, gese, and hens,\"[423] was typical,\r\nnot, it is true, of the more substantial men, but of many of the less\r\nwell-to-do?\r\n\r\n    [422] For an amusing example see Conway, _The Alps from End to\r\n    End_, pp. 190-192.\r\n\r\n    [423] _The Commonweal of this Realm of England_, p. 57.\r\n\r\nBut there was another and more fundamental reason for the importance\r\nattached to rights of common, and for the disastrous re-action upon the\r\ntenantry involved in their curtailment. It was that the possession of\r\npasture was not only a source of subsidiary income but also quite\r\nindispensable to the maintenance of the arable holding, which was\r\neverywhere the backbone of the tenants' livelihood. Ask a modern small\r\nholder, and he will tell you that what he wants is a certain proportion\r\nof grass-land to arable, in order that he may feed his horses without\r\nhaving to resort to the hire of extra land, to the purchase of\r\nfoodstuffs, or to turning them out to pick up a living where they can by\r\nthe side of the road.[424] In the normal village community this was\r\nsecured by the apportionment of rights of pasture to each arable\r\nholding, the tenants grazing their cattle on the common in the summer,\r\nand only feeding them on their separate closes when the approach of\r\nwinter made shelter a necessity.[425] It is, therefore, a mistake to\r\nthink of the engrossing of commons by large farmers as affecting the\r\npeasant only in so far as he was a shepherd or a grazier. On the\r\ncontrary, it struck a blow at an indispensable adjunct of his arable\r\nholding, an adjunct without which the ploughland itself was\r\nunprofitable; for to work the ploughland one must have the wherewithal\r\nto feed the plough beasts. It is this close interdependence of common\r\nrights with tillage which explains both the manner of their organisation\r\nand the distress caused by encroachments upon them. Rights of common of\r\nthe most general type go with the tenement, not with the tenant, because\r\nwhat is considered is the maintenance of a fully equipped arable\r\nholding in the open fields, and for this end it is not necessary to\r\nallow common rights to the population of younger sons, servants, or\r\nothers who do not hold one of these primary units of tillage. The\r\ncommoners are often \"stinted,\" restricted[426] that is in the number of\r\nbeasts which they may put upon the pasture, because rights of grazing\r\nhave to be distributed among all the arable holdings, such holdings\r\nbeing unworkable without them. Rights of common are often apportioned\r\namong the tenants \"according to the magnitude of their holdings,\" for,\r\nof course, a large holding will need more plough beasts, and therefore\r\nmore pasture, than a small one. Their boundaries are accurately recorded\r\nfrom this tree to that stone and such and such a hill, because otherwise\r\nan invasion of foreigners with their cattle from a neighbouring village\r\nmay eat them up like locusts. To divide them up among the tenants may do\r\nno harm provided the division is an equitable one, for each man will\r\nstill have his equipment of pasture, though in the form of a limited\r\narea instead of in the form of a limited quota of beasts. To appropriate\r\ncommon pastures without compensation may ruin a whole village; it is to\r\nseize a piece of free capital without which cows and horses cannot be\r\nfed, and thus it is virtually to confiscate the beasts, which are the\r\npeasant's tools. When that is done he must either re-assert his rights,\r\nor throw up his arable holding, or hire pasture for a money rent;\r\nsometimes--a bitter thought--he must hire grass-land from the very man\r\nwho has robbed him.[427]\r\n\r\n    [424] Ten acres of \"turf\" to forty acres of arable was the\r\n    estimate of his requirements made to me by an Oxfordshire small\r\n    holder.\r\n\r\n    [425] _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i.: \"The tenants of\r\n    Landress have common in a certayne ground called King's Moore\r\n    for all kinde of cattle, and every one of them may keep in the\r\n    said moore as much of all kind of cattle in somer as their\r\n    severall or ingrounde will beare in the wynter, whyche is a\r\n    great relief to the poore tenants, for as they confesse they\r\n    keep all their cattle there in the somer, and reserve their\r\n    ingroundes untouched for the winter.\"\r\n\r\n    [426] _e.g._ _Southampton Court Leet Records_ (Hearnshaw), pp.\r\n    4-5, 1550: \"Item we present that no burgers or comyners at one\r\n    time comyn above the number of two beasts upon payne of every\r\n    such defaulte 2s.; provided that iff any of them have two kyne\r\n    or wenlings, he shall have no horse, and yf he have but one cow\r\n    he may have one horse.\"\r\n\r\n    [427] _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i.--Rolleston\r\n    (Stafford): \"The said manor is ... well inhabited with divers\r\n    honest men, whose trade of lyvinge is onlie by husbandry ... and\r\n    have no large pastures or severall closes ... but have been\r\n    alwaie accustomed to have their cattle and sometyme their\r\n    ploughe beasts pastured in the Queen's Majestie's Park of\r\n    Rolleston, for xxd., the stage ... without which aide and help\r\n    they were neither able to maintain hospitallitie nor tyllage;\r\n    and nowe of late yeares the fermor of the herbage hath advanced\r\n    the stage to 6s. 8d., and yet the Quene's Majesties rent nothing\r\n    increased.\"\r\n\r\nOne must not, of course, unduly simplify the picture. Different villages\r\nare very differently endowed with grazing land. On some there is a\r\ncommon waste, and a common pasture in addition of superior quality, so\r\nthat the waste can be left to animals which will thrive on rough land.\r\nOn others there is not even a common waste, and the tenants have to do\r\nthe best they can on the stubble which lies open after harvest. Nor do\r\nthey all manage the apportionment of grazing rights in the same way. As\r\nwe have seen, there has been a movement towards the formation of\r\nseparate closes; and even when all the pasture is administered in\r\ncommon, it may either be that each villager looks after his own animals,\r\nor that the township, intent on seeing that the common is not\r\noverstocked, appoints a common shepherd and a common cowherd, who drives\r\nthem all afield together \"under the opening eyelids of the morn.\" Under\r\nall such diversities, however, which can often be paralleled from the\r\npractice of continental communes to-day, there is the fundamental fact\r\nof the necessity of rights of pasture to successful tillage.\r\nFitzherbert's remark that \"an husband cannot well thrive by his corne\r\nwithout he have other cattle, nor by his cattle without corne,\"[428] is\r\nreiterated in different forms by other surveyors. When they tell us that\r\na common adjoining a town is a \"great relief to the poor tenants,\" and\r\nrecommend that a special clause be inserted in a farmer's lease binding\r\nhim not to appropriate the pasture without which the tenants \"were not\r\nable to maintain their tenements,\" they are speaking of matters which\r\nthey understand far better than we possibly can, and must be believed.\r\n\r\n    [428] Fitzherbert, _Book of Husbandry_.\r\n\r\nThe monopolising of commons by manorial authorities who wished to form a\r\nlarge sheep-run can be traced through several stages, of which actual\r\nenclosure is only one, and the climax rather than the beginning. It\r\nusually begins with the overstocking of the common pasture by the owner\r\nof great flocks and herds, and the consequent edging out of the small\r\nman, though, of course, when the area is a large one, and when, as in\r\nWiltshire, there are great downs which are suitable for sheep, it may be\r\na long time before the latter feels the pinch severely. But the mere\r\noverriding by a capitalist of the customary allotment of pasture rights\r\nis usually only the first step. As long as matters are left in this\r\ntransition stage there is endless friction and disturbance, because each\r\nparty tries to oust the other, the great man swamping the pasture with\r\nhis beasts, and the peasants defiantly insisting that the recognised\r\nstint shall be observed--a guerilla warfare in which the farmer's\r\nservants are matched against the township's cowherd and the common\r\npound. Enclosing follows as a way of regularising the new arrangements,\r\nby substituting a tangible and prickly boundary for an ideal limit.\r\nSometimes enclosure is demanded by the peasants and resented by the\r\nwell-to-do, who think that in the general squabble they will come off\r\nbest. More often it is carried out with a high hand by the farmer and\r\nthe lord, who, once they take seriously to cattle-breeding or\r\nsheep-farming, have naturally no desire to have a limit set to their\r\ninvestment in stock. Occasionally compensation[429] is given to the\r\ndispossessed commoners in the shape of an abatement in their rents, or\r\nof a fresh pasture in another quarter. In most of our documents,\r\nhowever, there is little trace of any deliberate re-adjustment of\r\nrights. We are simply told that \"he holds the whole of the hilly\r\npasture,\" or that he has \"a heath enclosed with a hedge,\" or that\r\ngrounds have been \"enclosed contrary to the custom of the manor.\" We can\r\ntrace the effect in the small number of beasts which other tenants keep,\r\nbut we are left to conjecture how this state of things was reached. Our\r\nimpression is that in most cases the enclosing of commons was carried\r\nout in the simplest and most arbitrary way, by the lord or the farmer\r\nerecting a hedge round such part of the common pasture as he cared to\r\nappropriate, and leaving the tenants to make good their demand that it\r\nshould be removed, if they could.\r\n\r\n    [429] _Northumberland County History_, vol. v., Birling:\r\n    \"Allowed part of 25s. 4d. for focage of Orchard Medow and\r\n    Mylneside Bank, because they are now enclosed within the lord's\r\n    new Park, and this allowance shall be made yearly until the\r\n    tenants of Byrling have and peacefully enjoy another parcel of\r\n    pasture to the same value 11s. 8d.\" (Bailiff's Accounts, 1474).\r\n    R.O. _Misc. Books Land Rev._, vol. ccxx., f. 236: \"Divers\r\n    parcels of land and pasture of the manor of Farfield, now common\r\n    of 140 acres, now occupied by the tenants there as commons and\r\n    given them in exchange in satisfaction of their old common\r\n    imparked in the new Park, £6, 13s. 8d.\"\r\n\r\nCould they make it good? The question of the degree to which different\r\nclasses of tenants could obtain legal redress for disturbance will be\r\ndiscussed later. But we cannot leave this part of our subject without\r\nconsidering shortly the standpoints towards disputes arising out of the\r\nloss of rights of common, which were adopted by the peasantry and by\r\nlegal opinion. One may point out, in the first place, that their\r\nstandpoints were by no means the same. The contrast which we have\r\nalready ventured to draw between the considerable elements of practical\r\ncommunism in the working arrangements of the village community and the\r\nstrict and (so we believe) correct interpretation of the law of the\r\nKing's Courts, which treats its members simply as holders of individual\r\nrights which they on occasion exercise jointly, comes out very\r\nstrikingly in the different attitudes adopted towards rights of pasture.\r\nIf we must be careful not to see communism where there are really only\r\nindividual rights, we must also be careful not to see only individual\r\nrights where there is in fact a considerable amount of communism.\r\nHowever much it may be necessary to emphasise the \"rough and rude\r\nindividualism\"[430] latent in these arrangements, we must admit that for\r\nthe peasants themselves, who make and depend upon them, they contain\r\nfeatures which are not easily explained without the use of words which\r\nthe lawyers are reluctant to allow us--words implying some degree of\r\npractical communism. We must remember that the custom of the manor is\r\nitself a kind of law, and that though the lawyers who sit in the King's\r\nCourts may cast their rules into a feudal mould, which attenuates rights\r\nof common to mere concessions made by the lord to individual tenants,\r\nyet the law of the village, the custom of the manor, to which the first\r\nappeal is made, does treat them as containing a distinctly communal\r\nelement. In practice the whole body of customary tenants are found\r\nmanaging their commons on a co-operative plan. They regulate their use\r\nand re-adjust the regulations, sometimes at almost every meeting of the\r\ncourt. As a community, they hire additional pasture and administer town\r\nlands. As a community, they make arrangements for enclosure and even\r\nsell part of their common--the common in which only individuals have\r\nproprietary rights--to persons who undertake to invest capital in\r\nimproving it.[431] When all regulations fail and the enemy attempts to\r\nevade their vigilance by a strategic appearance of benevolence, a town\r\nsometimes returns to the charge with words glowing with what can only be\r\ncalled the pride of common property, though the title to that property\r\nmay be of a very shadowy kind. \"Whereas of late days,\" proclaimed the\r\nCourt Leet of Southampton in 1579, \"there hathe ben a peice of our\r\ncommon and heathe ditched and hedged and enclosed in and planted with\r\nwillows under the name of a shadow for our cattle, which have hitherto\r\nmany yeares past prospered verie well as the common was\r\nbefore;--wherefore (therefore) we desire that it may be pulled down\r\nagain and levelled as before, for we doubt that in short time yt will be\r\ntaken from our common to some particular man's use, which were\r\nlamentable and pitiable and not sufferable. For as our ancestors of\r\ntheir great care and travail have provided that and like other many\r\nbenefits for their successors, so we thinke it our dutie in conscience\r\nto keepe, uphold and maintaine the same as we found yt for our\r\nposteritie to come, without diminishing any part or parcel from yt, but\r\nrather to augment more to yt yf may be.\" We need not ask in what sense\r\nthe Southampton men had inherited the salt marsh from their ancestors,\r\nor whether a lawyer would not have made short work of their claim to\r\nleave it to posterity. It is enough to realise that they feel it to\r\nbelong to their town in a quite effective and intimate manner, that they\r\nstint it, turn off intruders, guard it for their descendants, defend it,\r\nif need be, with bows and arrows and pikes, and the other agricultural\r\nimplements of that forceful age. We know that people commit many crimes\r\nin the name of posterity. But they do not usually think of bequeathing\r\nto their grandchildren rights which have never had any existence for\r\nthemselves. We shall hardly understand all that was meant for a village\r\nby the loss of its common pastures unless we allow for that feeling of\r\npractical proprietorship, unless we confess that a society of\r\nlandholders becomes on occasions something very like a landholding\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n    [430] Pollock and Maitland, _History of English Law_, vol. i. p.\r\n    606.

The following seems a clear case of more\r\n    or less corporate action. Holkham MSS., Burnham, Bdle. 5, No.\r\n    94: \"Copy of an indenture between [here follows a list of names]\r\n    of the same town and county, yeomen, as well on the behalf of\r\n    themselves as of the rest of the comoners and freeholders of the\r\n    said town of the one part, and Robert Bacon of [illegible] in\r\n    the County of Norfolk, and Thomas Coke of Grays Inn in the\r\n    County of Middlesex of the other part, that whereas heretofore\r\n    Sir Philip [illegible] being lord and owner of the marshes\r\n    hereafter mentioned ... did by his indenture of bargain and sale\r\n    bearing date ... 1588, grant bargain and sell unto [list of\r\n    names as above] all those marsh grounds lying and being in\r\n    Burnham, to have and to hold the said premises to the parties\r\n    last before mentioned and their heires to the use of them and\r\n    their heires for ever, to the intent and purpose notwithstanding\r\n    that the said parties last before mentioned there, being\r\n    inhabitants in certain ancient messuages in the said Towne, and\r\n    all other inhabitants of the said Towne there and afterwards for\r\n    the tyme being in any of the ancient messuages and cottages in\r\n    the said towne, for so long time as they shall be there\r\n    inhabitinge and noe longer, according to the quantity of their\r\n    tenures within the said Towne might depasture and feede the land\r\n    as by the said deeds referring thereunto being had may more\r\n    fully appeare; [it recites that the land] may by wallinge and\r\n    embankinge the same be improved to more than a [illegible]\r\n    value, and made fitt for arrable, meadowe, and pasture grounde,\r\n    whereby tillage may be increased and his Majestie's subjects\r\n    receive more employment thereby, and danger of drawing\r\n    [drowning?] of their stock for their feedinge prevented [recites\r\n    that Robert Bacon and Thomas Coke have undertaken to drain the\r\n    land in return for receiving three parts of it and that the\r\n    persons above mentioned] being the major parte of the parties\r\n    interested in the said salte Marshes, and being enabled by the\r\n    lawes and Statutes of this realm to contract and bargaine with\r\n    any person or persons for the draining thereof\" [now convey 3\r\n    parts of the marshes to the above-mentioned Robert Bacon and\r\n    Thomas Coke], June 8, 1637. The motive of this agreement was to\r\n    get the low-lying meadows on the sea-coast drained. Drainage\r\n    schemes were much in the air about this time, and any one who\r\n    has seen the country near Holkham and Burnham will know how\r\n    badly protection from the sea was needed. Two points are worth\r\n    noticing: (i.) the tenants have no objection to surrendering\r\n    part of their common if they get a _quid pro quo_; (ii.) they\r\n    act as a single body. They buy land and they sell land and they\r\n    can leave it to their heirs. Certain persons in the township act\r\n    on their behalf, much as directors might act for a body of\r\n    shareholders. Is it possible to speak of such arrangements\r\n    simply in terms of individual rights? Are we not driven to think\r\n    of the township as almost a landholding corporation?\r\n\r\nBut, in the second place, such communal aspirations are a matter of\r\nfeeling and custom, not of national law. It is hardly necessary to point\r\nout that these words do not put an aspect of the case which could be\r\npleaded in court in a dispute as to common of pasture. At the touch of\r\nthe law, as has often been pointed out, the communal element, of which\r\nSouthampton makes so much, seems to crumble away. If, to the eye of the\r\npeasants, a manor was a more or less self-conscious community with\r\nconsiderable powers of controlling the administration of its pastures,\r\nit was, to the eye of the common lawyer, a collection of individuals\r\nbound together by their relation to the manorial authorities, but in\r\nother respects able to enforce rights of common only in so far as those\r\nrights could be shown to be enjoyed by one of the four[432] titles which\r\nthe law recognised. It is quite true that in practice the use of common\r\npastures extended to persons who could not plead one of those titles,\r\nand that the economic working of the village often cannot be brought\r\ninside the four corners of a legal formula. But when a right of pasture\r\nis challenged by the lord of the manor, the tenant must show that his\r\nright falls within them or lose his case. Of those four titles residence\r\nin a manor was not one. The occupier who is the unit of English Local\r\nGovernment to-day had, as such, no standing, because he was not, _qua_\r\noccupier, a holder of one of the arable shares with which, primarily,\r\nrights of pasture went. Again, a great number of cottagers and day\r\nlabourers, who were not holders of arable, but who in practice used the\r\ncommons for pigs, geese, poultry, and cows, were likely to be legally in\r\nthe same unprotected condition; so that it is obvious that, when\r\nenclosing took place, there might be a considerable number of persons,\r\nperhaps an actual majority of the villagers, who could not even raise\r\nthe question whether they could obtain redress or not, and that much\r\ndistress could be caused without any infringement of the law. Of those\r\nwho could bring their enjoyment of rights of pasture under one of the\r\ncategories which the law recognised, the freeholders were, of course, in\r\nthe strongest position. They could plead rights of common appendant to\r\ntheir tenements; probably they could often plead common appurtenant, and\r\ncommon in gross, common by a special personal grant, as well, and they\r\ncould enforce their rights both by self-help, in the way of throwing\r\ndown recent enclosures, and by the ordinary remedies of the Assize of\r\nNovel Disseisin or an action of trespass.\r\n\r\n    [432] Common appendant, common appurtenant, common in gross, and\r\n    common par cause de vicinage. This classification is not found\r\n    in Bracton, and appears to date from the late Middle Ages, see\r\n    Vinogradoff, _Villainage in England_, Essay II., chap, ii., and\r\n    the following case: _Coke's Reports_, Part IV., p. 60. Hill, 4\r\n    Jac. I. in Communi Banco: \"Robert Smith brought an action of\r\n    Trespass against Stephen Gatewood, gent., quare clausum fregit\r\n    ... cum quibusdam averiis.... Defendant pleaded a certain\r\n    custom, 'quod inhabitantes infra eandem villam de Stixwood\r\n    prædictam infra aliquod antiquum messuagium ibidem ratione\r\n    commorantiæ et residentiæ suæ in eadem habuerunt et usi fuerunt\r\n    et consueverunt habere com. Pastur ... pro omnibus et omnimodis\r\n    bobus et equis et aliis grossis animalibus.' Unanimously\r\n    resolved that the custom is against law. 1. That there are but\r\n    four manners of common, common appendant, appurtenant, in gross,\r\n    and by reason of vicinage, and this common _ratione commorantiæ_\r\n    is none of them. 2. What estate shall he have, who is\r\n    inhabitant, in the common, when it appears he hath no estate or\r\n    interest in the house (but a mere habitation and dwelling) in\r\n    respect of which he ought to have his common? For none can have\r\n    interest in a common in respect of a house in which he hath no\r\n    interest.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Statute of Merton, which expressly allowed a lord to\r\nenclose commonable land on condition that he left sufficient for the\r\nfree tenants, did not mean that a lord could arbitrarily cut down rights\r\nof common to what he was pleased to think sufficient. If it had, there\r\nwould have been little enclosing of commons in the sixteenth century,\r\nfor by that time there would have been little common left to enclose.\r\nThe question \"what is sufficient?\" had to be answered by a jury, a jury\r\nrepresenting expert knowledge as to local customs and the agrarian\r\nusages of the township. The jury could only answer it by taking account\r\nof the size of the tenements and of the land available for commoning. In\r\nfact, it found itself at once considering the custom of the manor, which\r\nstinted rights of pasture according to the economic needs and resources\r\nof different villages. Of the position of the customary tenants it is,\r\nfor reasons which will be given below, less easy to speak. Regarded from\r\nthe standpoint of the economic organisation of the manor, their rights\r\nof pasture should have got protection as much as those of the\r\nfreeholders, for as holders of ancient tenements they required pasture\r\nto enable them to carry on their tillage; and since they were, in most\r\nparts of the country, by far the most numerous class, the aggregate of\r\ntheir commonable area was much larger than was that of the free tenants.\r\nAccording to the canon of interpretation supplied by Coke,[433] the\r\nStatute of Merton would appear, at any rate in the latter part of the\r\nsixteenth century, to have been construed as protecting them; and\r\nFitzherbert,[434] though he introduces an additional complication by\r\ntrying--trying, it seems, quite arbitrarily--to prove that rights of\r\npasture over the waste and rights of pasture on land which was not\r\ntechnically part of the waste, ought to be treated differently, places\r\nall tenants on an equal footing in respect of their claim to be left\r\n\"sufficient common.\"\r\n\r\n    [433] Coke, Complete Copyholder, Sect. 53: \"When an Act of\r\n    Parliament altereth the service, tenure, or interest of the\r\n    land, or other thing in prejudice of the lord or of the Customs\r\n    of the Manor, or in prejudice of the tenant, then the generall\r\n    words of such an Act of Parliament extend not to the copyhold;\r\n    but when an Act is generally made for the good of the\r\n    commonwealth, and no prejudice may accrue by reason of the\r\n    alteration of any interest, service, tenure, or Custom, of the\r\n    Manor, there usually copyhold lands are within the generall\r\n    purview of such Acts.\"\r\n\r\n    [434] Fitzherbert, _Book of Surveying_: \"And as for that manner\r\n    of common, me seemeth the Lord may improve himself of their\r\n    waste grounds, leaving their own tenants sufficient common,\r\n    having no regard to the tenants of the other lordship. But as\r\n    far as all errable lands, meadows, leises, and pastures, the\r\n    lordes may improve themselves by course of the common law, for\r\n    the statute speaketh nothing but of waste grounds.\"\r\n\r\nThe treatment by the law of common rights, in the case both of\r\nfreeholders and of the customary tenants, seems to fit roughly into this\r\nscheme, though the actual facts are somewhat more complex than it would\r\nsuggest. The cases show that the freeholders had a legal remedy if\r\nenclosure deprived them of rights of pasture, and that this remedy was\r\nused. A freeholder could say \"these be the pastures ... which should be\r\nmy common ... after the tenure of my freehold;\"[435] if he proved the\r\nfact he got protection, and on manors where the freeholders were\r\nnumerous and the lord wanted to make very large enclosures, he had to\r\nbuy them out. It is true also that the freeholders[436] joined with the\r\nfarmer on some manors in enclosing commonable land, to the detriment of\r\nthe customary tenants, who apparently sometimes had to acquiesce in it.\r\nThey show again that a customary tenant could obtain protection for his\r\nrights of common pasture both, at any rate in the sixteenth century,\r\nfrom the Common Law Courts, and also, at an earlier date, from the Court\r\nof Chancery, provided that he could show that such rights were attached\r\nto his holding by the custom of the manor, a very important\r\nqualification, to which we must return.[437] On the other hand, it is\r\ncertainly true that both freeholders and customary tenants suffered in\r\nour period from a curtailment of common rights, in spite of the\r\nqualified protection enjoyed by the latter and the complete protection\r\nenjoyed by the former. We cannot, in fact, be content with a mere\r\nsummary of the legal position, for the law is not always strong enough\r\nor elastic enough to cope with shifting economic forces. Or, rather, its\r\narm is short, and it can only grapple with those conflicts which are\r\nsufficiently violent to force their way to Westminster.\r\n\r\n    [435] _e.g._ _Coventry Leet Book_, vol. ii. p. 510.\r\n\r\n    [436] _Genealoger and Archæologist_, vol. i., Manor of West\r\n    Coker (Somerset): \"The demesnes remayneth in one entier ferm,\r\n    and is dymysed to one Sir John Seymour, knight, who being\r\n    confederate with the freeholders of the manor, maketh such\r\n    inclosers for his owne lucre, and suffreth the freeholders to do\r\n    the same, nevertheless surcharge the common with their cattle,\r\n    that in process of tyme yt wilbe the destruccion of the\r\n    custumarye tenants.\"\r\n\r\n    [437] For a discussion of the legal position of the copyholders\r\n    see below, pp. 287-310.\r\n\r\nSome light may be thrown on the kind of trouble of which our period was\r\nfull by two accounts which have come down to us of disputes concerning\r\nrights of common pasture. At Coventry[438] there were in the fifteenth\r\ncentury prolonged quarrels between the City and the Prior and Convent of\r\nthe Cathedral Church of St. Mary. In 1485 the Prior was accused by the\r\ncity authorities of wrongfully overcharging the common with sheep and\r\ncattle, to the damage of the city. He replied by admitting the legal\r\nrights of the other commoners, but by claiming that whereas they could\r\nonly pasture a limited number of beasts, \"by the lawe of this lande the\r\nlord of the waste soyle may surcharge and pasture there what nombre hym\r\nlykes,\" and that therefore in overstocking the common he was only\r\nexercising his rights. To this the city answered by a rather hesitating\r\nappeal to custom, according to which the commoners never had been\r\nstinted to a fixed number of beasts, and by pointing out that, if the\r\nPrior was allowed to put as many beasts on the common as he pleased, he\r\nwas virtually confiscating the property of the other commoners. This\r\ncase brings out very clearly one weakness in the position even of the\r\nfree tenants. It was that, while they were protected by law against\r\nattempts actually to deprive them of rights of common, the protection\r\nmight be held to be contingent on the lord or his farmer proceeding so\r\nfar as not to leave them sufficient, and was not available if the\r\nencroachments only went so far as to diminish their common pasture.\r\nThere was a minimum which they could not lose: but above this minimum\r\ntheir rights of pasture were elastic and compressible, and when, as in\r\nthis case, the pasture was so large as to make any numerical limit to\r\nthe number of beasts which they might graze unnecessary, the commoners\r\nmight be deprived of some part of their customary pasture without any\r\ninfringement of the law.[439]\r\n\r\n    [438] _Coventry Leet Book_, vol. ii. pp. 445-446 and _passim_.\r\n\r\n    [439] If the common was so large that it had been unnecessary to\r\n    \"stint\" it, why did the city object to the lord putting\r\n    additional beasts on? I take the situation to be that the\r\n    Prior--probably tempted by the profitableness of sheep-farming\r\n    in the latter part of the fifteenth century--diminished the\r\n    pasture which the city could use, by putting on many more beasts\r\n    than ever before, which, in the absence of a recognised \"stint,\"\r\n    he was able to do without violating any custom, as he would have\r\n    done if there had been a customary limit, as on many manors.\r\n    Another aspect of the problem is illustrated by a story of a\r\n    similar struggle at Wootton Basset,[440] a small borough in\r\n    Wiltshire. Early in the seventeenth century the mayor and\r\n    freemen of Wootton Basset petition Parliament to \"enact\r\n    something for us, that we may enjoy our right again.\" What they\r\n    want is a restoration of certain rights of common which a\r\n    powerful neighbour has taken from them. Their story--they seem\r\n    to rehearse it with tears in their eyes--is a perfect Odyssey of\r\n    misfortunes. According to them, the manor of Wootton Basset had\r\n    passed in 1555 into the hands of Sir Francis Englefield, who\r\n    enclosed a park containing 2000 acres, in which the free tenants\r\n    had hitherto had rights of pasture, and had them without stint,\r\n    owing to its great size. This wicked man showed them, however, a\r\n    sort of contemptuous compassion. He left them 100 acres, with\r\n    which they had to be content, and the rights over which they\r\n    carefully apportioned, \"to the Mayor for the time being two\r\n    cowes feeding, and to the constable one cowe feeding, and to\r\n    every inhabitant of the said Borough, each and every of them,\r\n    one cowe feeding and no more, as well the poore as the riche.\"\r\n    These rights of common were in practice vested in all the\r\n    tenements in the town (not only, it would appear, the free\r\n    tenements), and property was bought and sold subject to them.\r\n    The occasion of the petition was that the grand nephew of the\r\n    original grantee, having apparently got, by some means which the\r\n    petitioners could not explain, the title deed of the common into\r\n    his hands, set out to ruin those whom his ancestor had only\r\n    robbed. He began lawsuits against the free tenants, excluded\r\n    them from the 100 acres of common which remained to them, and\r\n    put his own cattle on it. The suits, according to our story,\r\n    were purposely deferred, and dragged on so long that one of the\r\n    free tenants was actually made bankrupt by legal charges and the\r\n    rest were impoverished, the common being used meantime by the\r\n    plaintiff, Sir Francis Englefield.\r\n\r\n    [440] _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. iii. These are the\r\n    people whom Heaven protected in the way described on p. 148\r\n    note. Observe what this little community endured. (i.) Sir\r\n    Francis Englefield, senior, seizes 1900 out of 2000 acres of\r\n    their common. (ii.) Sir Francis Englefield, junior, seizes \"the\r\n    charter of our town ... and the deed of the said common.\" (iii.)\r\n    He tries to seize the remaining 100 acres, and ruins them by\r\n    lawsuits \"for the space of seven or eight years at the least,\r\n    and never suffers any one to come to triall in all that space\r\n    ... that the said Free tenants were not able to wage law any\r\n    longer, for one John Rous ... was thereby enforced to sell all\r\n    his land (to the value of £500) with following the suits in law,\r\n    and many were thereby impoverished.\" (iv.) He turns them out of\r\n    their shops in the market-place, and introduces instead \"a\r\n    stranger that liveth not in the town.\" (v.) He appoints his own\r\n    nominee as mayor, in defiance of the custom which requires him\r\n    to appoint one of two men submitted to him by the jury. (vi.) He\r\n    prevents his victims from signing this petition by threats of\r\n    eviction. (\"They are fearful that they shall be put forth of\r\n    their bargaines, and then they shall not tell how to live,\r\n    otherwise they would have set to their hands.\")\r\n\r\nThese examples of struggles over rights of common pasture are\r\ninstructive in several ways. In the first place, they suggest that the\r\nfreeholders were regarded as having a better title than the rest of the\r\ncommunity, and that they led the movement to resist encroachments for\r\nthat reason. It is the free tenants who petition Parliament for redress,\r\nand the free tenants who are sued. If they lose their case it is not\r\nworth while, it seems, for the customary tenants to take any action. In\r\nthe second place, they show that the classes who have the best legal\r\ntitle to right of pasture are not at all commensurate with the classes\r\nwho will lose if they are taken away. Whatever the legal rights of the\r\nother tenants may be they have as much practical benefit out of the\r\ncommon, and as great an interest in protecting it against encroachments,\r\nas the freeholders have. When the shearing away of part of it makes it\r\nnecessary to limit the number of beasts to be kept there, the limitation\r\nis applied to free and customary tenements alike without distinction,\r\nand both classes of tenements are bought and sold on the understanding\r\nthat they carry with them a right of common pasture. In the third place,\r\nthe case of Wootton Basset is one of many examples of the way in which\r\npoverty, ignorance of the law, and the practical difficulties of getting\r\njustice against a powerful landlord, prevent humble litigants from\r\nenforcing their legal rights. Finally, it reinforces what has been said\r\nabove as to the economic importance of rights of pasture. The\r\narrangements which are made at Wootton Basset when the first assault\r\nupon the commons takes place show clearly that grazing land is thought\r\nof as a quite indispensable adjunct to every man's holding, and its loss\r\nis so disastrous to the community that they are ready to be slowly bled\r\nto death by lawyer's fees, rather than be beggared at a blow by\r\nsubmitting tamely without a contest.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) _The Engrossing of Holdings and Displacement of Tenants._\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt at some length on the loss of rights of common, because\r\nthe misleading modern associations of the word seem sometimes to prevent\r\na proper appreciation of the very important place which they occupied in\r\nthe agricultural economy of our period. It must be confessed, however,\r\nthat, in dealing with them first, we have reversed the order in which\r\ngrievances due to enclosure were set out by the writers of the time.\r\nThough there are many bitter complaints against the enclosure of\r\ncommons, it was, notwithstanding this, less the loss of rights of\r\npasture than the consolidation of small tenancies into great farms,\r\nwhich aroused public excitement, at any rate, in the southern and\r\nmidland counties. In the Statutes the words enclosure and depopulation\r\nare again and again combined as though they were almost synonymous; and\r\nif a contemporary had been asked to explain the special evils most\r\ncharacteristic of enclosing, he would certainly have given the first\r\nplace to the \"engrossing of farms\" and \"depopulation,\" the throwing\r\ntogether of peasant holdings and the eviction of their tenants. We must\r\nnow examine this side of the movement. Did the displacement of tenants\r\nthrough the concentration of properties take place on the large scale\r\nsuggested by the passionate outbursts of contemporary writers, or were\r\ntheir complaints as to empty villages and ruined churches mere\r\nrhetorical exaggeration? Again, what was the legal position of the\r\nclasses of people who suffered? Were they entirely without the\r\nprotection of the law, or did they fail to obtain legal protection\r\nprincipally in consequence of ignorance and intimidation?\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand the strong motives for throwing together\r\npeasant holdings, if we keep our eyes on the picture of agricultural\r\narrangements given in the maps. It will be seen that the different\r\nblocks of demesne land are often separated from each other by two or\r\nthree strips belonging to the smaller tenantry, and that if such strips\r\nwere removed they could be fitted together into a wide and unbroken\r\nexpanse of territory. The manorial authorities have often, it is clear,\r\nbeen for a long time consolidating the demesne by exchange and purchase,\r\nso as to avoid the wastefulness of having land scattered in a hundred\r\nseparate pieces, and the only obstacle to its complete unification\r\nconsists of strips and patches which are held by tenants who are for one\r\nreason or another unwilling to sell, small spits and islands which stand\r\nout of the surrounding sea. Clearly there is an enormous temptation to\r\nmake the tide flow over them as well, to complete the circuit by merging\r\nthem in the demesne. Look, for example, at maps Nos. III., IV., and V.\r\nHere it is evident that there has been a good deal of consolidation.\r\nBoth the tenants and the lord of the manor have been forming their\r\nstrips into compact blocks. To unity of ownership has been added\r\nsomething like spatial unity. Still the process is by no means complete.\r\nThere are awkward little pieces of land which interrupt the smooth\r\nsurface of the great estate, pieces which one will have to walk round,\r\nwhere, if the demesne is used as arable, the demesne plough must stop,\r\nwhere, if it is used as pasture, a fence must be erected to shut out the\r\ndemesne sheep. Or walk down a typical field and mark how the land is\r\nheld. Here are the strips which one would pass, if one travelled from\r\nend to end of two parallel furlongs at West Lexham[441] in Norfolk in\r\nthe year 1575. They are copied in order from the map--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                 FURLONG A.           |              FURLONG B.\r\n                         ac. ro. po.  |                      ac. ro. po.\r\n   1.

The strips of Will Yelverton, Robert\r\nClement, Will Lee, and Will Gell must have been a constant eyesore to\r\nthe manorial authorities. Buy them out or evict them, and then the two\r\nfurlongs will consist of nothing but demesne land and glebe. They will\r\nbe two fields of quite a modern pattern and quite ready for enclosure.\r\nLeave these tenants where they are, and they are a permanent obstacle to\r\nunified management, all the more annoying because they are so petty.\r\nThey may even insist on the farmer observing the same course of\r\ncultivation as themselves, and on turning their beasts to common on his\r\nland after harvest! Is it not inevitable that, as soon as the lord is\r\npushed by economic forces into making his estate yield the maximum money\r\nreturn irrespective of a numerous tenantry or of the ancient methods of\r\ntillage, he should try in any way he can to get rid of what to him are\r\ntroublesome excrescences, that he should begin questioning titles,\r\nscrewing up rents, turning copyhold to leasehold?\r\n\r\nIf our hypothesis is correct we ought to be able to find manors where\r\nthe strips formerly held by tenants have been merged in the demesne, so\r\nas to form a continuous expanse, in the hands of the lord or his farmer,\r\nout of what was formerly a collection of fragments of separate holdings.\r\nTo see it verified, let us turn to another manor in the same county,\r\nthat of Walsingham,[442] which was surveyed in the reign of Henry VIII.\r\nHere is a statement of the land which is \"in the hands of the lord\" in\r\nthe west field--\r\n\r\n    IN THE WEST FELDE\r\n\r\n    1.

Off. Misc. Bks._, vol. cccxcix., f. 201 ff.\r\n\r\nHere one has a field divided into twenty-one strips. Of these strips\r\neighteen had at one time been in the occupation of separate individuals.\r\nThe picture is just what we are accustomed to in mediæval surveys. It is\r\nillustrated sufficiently for our purpose by the map of part of Salford,\r\non page 163. But some time before this survey of Walsingham was made a\r\ngreat change had taken place. The separate fragments had been taken out\r\nof the hands of the tenants and combined in the hands of the lord; the\r\nfield is ready for conversion to pasture and for enclosure. How\r\nextremely profitable it might be to substitute a single large farm for a\r\nnumber of small holdings is proved by Manorial Rentals. Taking five\r\nmanors in Wiltshire in the year 1568, one finds that the rents paid by\r\nthe farmer of the demesne work out at 1s. 6d., 7-3/4d., 1s. 5-3/4d., 1s.\r\n1-3/4d., 1s. 5-1/2d. per acre; those paid by the customary tenants at\r\n7-1/2d., 5d., 1s. 0-3/4d., 5-3/4d., 5-3/4d. per acre.[443]\r\n\r\n    [443] The manors are South Newton, Winterbourne Basset,\r\n    Knyghton, Donnington, and Estoverton and Phipheld (Roxburghe\r\n    Club, _Surveys of Pembroke Manors_).\r\n\r\nThe difference is, in itself, enough to explain a decided movement\r\ntowards an increase in the size of the unit of agriculture. But of\r\ncourse a powerful incentive to such procedure was supplied by the\r\ngrowth of pasture farming. In the days when the cultivation of the\r\ndemesne depended on the labour of the tenants there was obviously bound\r\nto be a certain proportion between the land belonging to the former and\r\nthe land held by the latter, a proportion which might be expressed by\r\nsaying \"no tenants, no demesne cultivation; no demesne cultivation, no\r\nincome for the lord.\" But when tillage was replaced by pasture farming\r\nthis economic rule of three ceased to work. On the one hand, the limit\r\nof size imposed on the demesne farm by considerations of management was\r\nremoved or at any rate enormously extended, for many thousand sheep\r\ncould be fed by two or three shepherds. On the other hand, the economic\r\nmotive for preventing a decline in the number of small landholders was\r\nweakened, because there was little use for their labour on a pasture\r\nfarm; while there was a great deal of use for their land, if only it\r\ncould be cleared of existing rights and added to it. We have, in fact,\r\nan ordinary case of the depreciation of particular[444] kinds of human\r\nlabour in comparison with capital, of the kind to which the modern world\r\nhas become accustomed in the case of machinery--become accustomed and\r\nbecome callous.\r\n\r\n    [444] This, of course, is not inconsistent with a general\r\n    appreciation, _i.e._ a general rise in wages and fall in the\r\n    rate of interest.\r\n\r\nWe shall perhaps best give precision to our ideas of the sort of policy\r\nwhich landlords were inclined to adopt, by taking a single concrete\r\ninstance, though of course conditions varied locally very much from\r\nplace to place. It comes from Hartley[445] in Northumberland, where\r\nRobert Delavale was lord of the manor in the reign of Elizabeth. The\r\nnarrator is his cousin, Joshua Delavale--\r\n\r\n     \"Since which time\" (_i.e._ 16 Eliz.), he says, \"the said Robert\r\n     Delavale purchased all the freeholder's lands and tenements,\r\n     displaced the said tenants, defaced their tenements, converted\r\n     their tillage to pasture, being 720 acres of arable ground or\r\n     thereabouts, and made one demaine, whereon there is but three\r\n     plows now kept by hinds and servants, besides the 720 acres. So\r\n     that where there was then in Hartley 15 serviceable men\r\n     furnished with sufficient horse and furniture, there is now not\r\n     any, nor hath been these 20 years last past or thereabouts.\"\r\n\r\nHere we get a complete example of the various steps which are taken to\r\nbuild up a great pasture farm. The freeholders are bought out; the other\r\ntenants are (it is to be inferred) evicted summarily; their houses are\r\npulled down; their land is thrown into the demesne; the whole area is\r\nlet down to pasture and managed by hired labourers, while the\r\nland-holding population is turned adrift. It is worth noticing that the\r\nword \"enclosing\" is not used. All the drastic changes that are usually\r\nascribed to enclosure can on occasion take place without it. Indeed, the\r\nmore drastic they are the less need is there to complete them by the\r\nerection of fences, for the smaller the population left to commit\r\nencroachments.\r\n\r\n    [445] _Northumberland County History_, vol. ix. p. 124. For a\r\n    similar case of evictions by Delavale, showing how they were\r\n    carried out, _ibid._, pp. 201-?202: \"There was in Seaton\r\n    Delavale township 12 tenements, whereon there dwelt 12 able men\r\n    sufficiently furnished with horse and furniture to serve his\r\n    Majestie ... who paid 46s. 8d. rent yearlie a piece or\r\n    thereabouts. All the said tenants and their successors saving 5\r\n    the said Robert Delavale eyther thrust out of their fermholds or\r\n    weried them by taking excessive fines, increasing of their rents\r\n    unto £3 a piece, and withdrawing part of their best land and\r\n    meadow from their tenements ... by taking their good land from\r\n    them and compelling them to winne moorishe and heathe ground,\r\n    and after their hedging heth ground to their great charge, and\r\n    paying a great fine, and bestowing great reparation on building\r\n    their tenements, he quite thrust them off in one yeare, refusing\r\n    either to repay the fine or to repay the charge bestowed in\r\n    diking or building.... The said seven fermholds displaced had to\r\n    every one of them 60 acres of arable land, viz. 20 in every\r\n    field at the least, as the tenants affirme, which amounteth to\r\n    480 acres of land yearlie or thereabouts, converted for the most\r\n    part from tillage to pasture, and united to the demaine of the\r\n    lordship of Seaton Delavale.\"\r\n\r\nIf such a process were general or even common, we should certainly have\r\nthe materials of a social revolution. But was it? The much discussed\r\nquestion of the effect of the agrarian changes on the numbers of the\r\nrural population is one which it is not possible to answer with any\r\napproach to accuracy, owing to the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient\r\nnumber of continuous series of surveys and rentals. Those relating to\r\nsingle years tell mainly results, when what we want to see is a process.\r\nNevertheless even single surveys are not altogether without value. They\r\nshow the distribution of land between different classes at a given\r\nmoment, and sometimes contain indications of the changes by which the\r\nexisting distribution was reached. In particular they show us the\r\nrelative areas of the demesne farm and of the land in the hands of all\r\nother classes of tenants. And this has a certain interest. For since the\r\ndemesne farm on a manor where conditions approximated most closely to\r\nthose of the Middle Ages and had been least affected by more recent\r\nchanges, rarely contained more than half the whole manorial territory\r\nand generally not so much, there is a _prima facie_ case for surmising\r\nconcentration of holdings and evictions when one finds two-thirds,\r\nthree-quarters, or even ninety per cent. of it in the hands of one large\r\nfarmer. It is, however, a very tedious task calculating the acreage held\r\nby a number of different tenants, and this may perhaps excuse the small\r\nnumber of instances which are given below.

If this is so, the\r\n    proportion of the latter to the rest of the manorial land would\r\n    of course be reduced.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that on eight of these sixteen manors more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole area, and on seven more than three-quarters, is\r\nin the hands of one individual, the farmer of the demesnes. These\r\nfigures are at any rate not inconsistent with a considerable\r\nconsolidation of tenancies and displacement of tenants, though we cannot\r\nsay that they prove it.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the surveys take us behind this presumptive evidence and\r\nenable us to trace the building up of large farms out of small holdings.\r\nFor example, at Ormesby,[449] in 1516, the lord of the manor held 219\r\nacres \"late in farm\" of six tenants. At Domerham,[450] some time before\r\n1568, enclosure of land in the open fields and conversion of arable to\r\npasture had been carried out by the largest of the three farmers. The\r\nprocess had been accompanied by depopulation; for in 1568 his farm\r\nincluded pieces of land which had formerly belonged to four smaller\r\ntenants, and the two large farms which he held had formerly been in\r\nseparate hands. It is probable that at Winterbourne Basset[451] somewhat\r\nthe same movement had taken place. In 1436 two carucates of land were\r\nheld by an unspecified number of tenants; in 1568 three customary\r\ntenants are still found there, but three-quarters of the manor is in the\r\nhands of a single farmer who has recently enclosed a field of 40 acres.\r\nElsewhere one can fill in the picture in somewhat greater detail. At\r\nTughall,[452] in Northumberland, the surveyor tells us in 1567, the\r\ndemesne lands had been let to a farmer, who acted as the lord's bailiff\r\nand collected the rents and services of the other tenants. He used his\r\nposition to partition the manor so as to get rid of the intermingled\r\nholdings, and at the same time so harassed the smaller tenants that they\r\nwere reduced from twenty-three to eight. At Cowpen[453] a similar\r\nconcentration of land was going on at the end of the sixteenth century;\r\nfirst five tenancies were thrown into one, and then the whole manor\r\npassed into the hands of one large farmer. At Newham,[454] near Alnwick,\r\nwe are told that a hundred and forty men, women, and children were\r\nevicted simultaneously. At Seaton[455] Delavale, the Robert Delavale who\r\nhad depopulated Hartly, turned adrift seven families out of twelve. The\r\nmap of a Leicestershire manor which is reproduced opposite page 223 is\r\nmore eloquent than many lamentations. In \"the place where the town of\r\nWhadboroughe once stood\" there was by 1620 not a single tenant left. The\r\nwhole of it formed one great expanse of pasture.\r\n\r\n    [449] R.O.

The most that can be said of them is that they prove\r\nthat the writers who spoke of whole towns being depopulated were not\r\nromancing. Nor are the statistics offered by contemporaries of any\r\npractical help towards determining the social effects of enclosure.\r\nThose who state, like Moore[456] (writing in the seventeenth century),\r\nthat they have seen \"in some townes fourteen, sixteen, and twenty\r\ntenants discharged of plowing,\" or, like the Dean of Durham,[457] that\r\n\"500 ploughs have decayed in a few years\" and \"of 8000 acres lately in\r\ntillage now not 8 score are tilled,\" may have seen what they say. But\r\nthese figures are suspiciously round, and the cases are obviously\r\nextreme ones, not samples. The one[458] writer who makes an estimate for\r\nthe whole country, putting the number of persons of all ages displaced\r\nbetween 1485 and 1550 at 300,000, is rash enough to explain how his\r\nestimate was reached, and his explanation shows that it was not even a\r\nplausible guess.\r\n\r\n    [456] Moore, _The Crying Sin of England_, &c.\r\n\r\n    [457] Cal.

The whiche 50,000 ploughs every plough was able to\r\n    maintain 6 persons, and nowe they have nothing, but goeth about\r\n    in England from dore to dore.\"\r\n\r\nThe returns collected for the Government seem at first to take us on to\r\nsurer ground. Investigations were made by Royal Commissioners[459] in\r\nthe years 1517-1519, 1548, 1566, 1607, 1632, 1635, and 1636. The returns\r\ncollected for twenty-three counties by the Commission of 1517, for four\r\ncounties by those of 1548-1566, and for six counties by that of 1607\r\nhave been printed. According to them, it would appear that between 1485\r\nand 1517 about one-half per cent. of the total area of the counties\r\ninvestigated was enclosed, and 6931 persons displaced, the corresponding\r\nfigures for the period 1578-1607 being 69,758 acres and 2232 evictions.\r\nBoth in the earlier, and in the later, period, the county which was\r\naffected most severely was Northamptonshire, where 2.21 per cent. of the\r\ncounty was returned as enclosed in the years 1485-1517, and in the years\r\n1578-1607 4.30 per cent., the numbers displaced being respectively 1405\r\nand 1444. If we like, we may adopt the conjectural estimates of\r\nProfessor Gay, and, assuming that the pace of the movement was the same\r\nduring the years for which we have not information as during those for\r\nwhich we have, may say with him that from 1455 to 1607 the agrarian\r\nchanges affected about 2.76 of the whole area of twenty-four counties,\r\nand displaced something between 30,000 and 50,000 persons.\r\n\r\n    [459] For a discussion of the value of these reports see Leadam,\r\n    _Domesday of Enclosures_, and _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, New\r\n    Series, vol. vi.; Gay, _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, New Series,\r\n    vol. xiv. and vol. xviii.; Gay, _Quarterly Journal of\r\n    Economics_, vol. xvii. (1902-1903). A useful summary of the\r\n    evidence, with a map illustrating the probable geographical\r\n    distribution of the movement, is given by Johnson, _The\r\n    Disappearance of the Small Landowner_, pp. 42-54 and Map I.\r\n\r\nThe statistics which have been worked up by Mr. Leadam and Professor Gay\r\nfrom the inquiries of the Government are extremely valuable as showing\r\nthe geographical distribution of the enclosing movement. It is most\r\npowerful in the Midland counties, which were in the sixteenth century\r\nthe chief granary of the country, and its influence is least in the\r\nSouth-West and South-East. In Somersetshire, Devonshire, and Cornwall,\r\nSuffolk, Essex and Kent the small enclosures[460] described in Part I.\r\nhad probably often been carried out by the peasants themselves at an\r\nearly date, with the result that those districts were, compared with the\r\nopen field villages of the Midlands, little disturbed. Those parts of\r\nthe country, in fact, where the peasantry have been most progressive,\r\nare relatively unaffected by the changes of our period. They have been\r\ninoculated and they are almost immune. On the other hand, one is\r\ninclined to say that the figures are not of much value for other\r\npurposes. In the nature of things they cannot be reliable, and, if they\r\nwere reliable, they would not really answer the most important questions\r\nwhich are asked about the social results of the changes to which they\r\nrefer. Let us remember the methods by which they were collected. They\r\nare taken from returns which are in the form of answers delivered to\r\ncommissioners by juries of peasants, juries which we know from the most\r\nactive of the commissioners to have been occasionally packed by the\r\nlocal proprietors, and often intimidated,[461] and to have been examined\r\nby the commissioners under the eyes of their landlords. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to point out that no evidence of even approximate accuracy\r\nwould be derived from an inquiry conducted in such a fashion at the\r\npresent day. Is it probable that it was obtained any more satisfactorily\r\nin the sixteenth century?\r\n\r\n    [460] It is a question how far there had ever been an open field\r\n    system in some of these counties, _e.g._ Cornwall and Kent.\r\n    There certainly were some open field villages of the ordinary\r\n    pattern in Kent (see Slater, _The English Peasantry and the\r\n    Enclosure of Common Fields_, p. 230). But Kent from an early\r\n    date develops on its own lines, and does not go through the same\r\n    stages of manorialism and commutation as other counties. Much of\r\n    it seems to start at the point which they reach only in the\r\n    sixteenth century. Cornwall again, though in the sixteenth\r\n    century there were commons where the villagers pastured their\r\n    cattle together (see accounts of Landress and Porpehan,\r\n    _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i.), was largely a county of\r\n    scattered homesteads and very early enclosure (for the\r\n    \"nucleated village\" and \"scattered homesteads,\" see Maitland,\r\n    _Domesday Book and Beyond_, pp. 15-16), pointing to a different\r\n    system of settlement from that of the counties where the open\r\n    field system obtained. For enclosures in Devon and Somerset see\r\n    Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, Modern\r\n    Times, Part II., App. B: \"A consideration of the cause in\r\n    question before the lords touchinge depopulation,\" and Carlyle's\r\n    _Cromwell_, Letter XXIV. \"Lest we should engage our body of\r\n    horse too far into that enclosed country.\"\r\n\r\n    [461] For intimidation see the case of Wootton Basset, quoted\r\n    above, pp. 251-253, and below, pp. 302-304. Also Gay, _Trans.\r\n    Royal Hist. Soc._, New Series, vol. xviii.; and Hales' defence\r\n    (appendix to Miss Lamond's introduction to _The Commonweal of\r\n    this Realm of England_).\r\n\r\nNor, if accurate, could these statistics really be used as a means of\r\ndisproving the accounts given by contemporary writers of the dislocation\r\nproduced by enclosure. That those accounts were highly coloured, no one\r\nfamiliar with the methods which the age brought to the discussion of\r\neconomic questions will doubt. Professor Gay does well to warn us\r\nagainst credulity. It is certainly a salutary discipline to turn from\r\nthe burning words of Latimer or Crowley to these official calculations,\r\nand then, by a glance at the chapters of Dr. Slater and Professor Gonner\r\non the enclosures of the eighteenth century, to realise that even in\r\nthose parts of England where the cry against depopulation had arisen\r\nmost bitterly two centuries before, there were still thousands of acres\r\nto be enclosed by some hundreds of Enclosure Acts. But if we must\r\ndiscount the protests of authors to whom all large economic changes seem\r\nto smell of the pit, we must not forget either that their views are\r\nformed by the conditions of their age, and that it is just in the\r\nconditions productive of this state of mind that even a moderate change\r\nis likely to work with the most disastrous effects. We who reckon in\r\nmillions and count a year lost which does not see some new outburst of\r\neconomic energy, must be very careful how we apply our statistics to\r\nmeasure the movements of an age where economic life differs not only in\r\nquantity but in quality, where most men have never seen more than a\r\nhundred separate individuals in the course of their whole lives, where\r\nmost households live by tilling their great-grandfathers' fields with\r\ntheir great-grandfathers' plough. We must not be too clever--our\r\nancestors would have said too wicked--for our subject. We must not\r\naccept an estimate of the amount of depopulation as an explanation of\r\nits effects; for the two things are not in _pari materia_. Certainly we\r\nmust not argue that, because the returns collected by Royal Commissions\r\nshow that in the counties affected most severely less than one-twentieth\r\nof the total area was enclosed, therefore the complaints of observers\r\nmust be taken as a hysterical exaggeration of slow and unimportant\r\nchanges. For one thing, summary tables are no measure of the distress\r\ncaused by eviction, till we know how the tables are made up. The\r\ndrifting away of one tenant from each of fifty manors, and the eviction\r\nof fifty tenants from one manor, yield precisely the same statistical\r\nresults when the total displacement from a given county is being\r\ncalculated. But the former would be scarcely noticeable; the latter\r\nmight ruin a village. For another thing, the total area of a county is a\r\nmere spatial expression, which is important to no one except\r\ngeographers. What mattered to the peasantry, and what matters to us, is\r\nnot the proportion which the land enclosed bore to the whole area of the\r\ncounty, but the proportion which it bore to the whole area available for\r\ncultivation. This, which is of course not ascertainable, is clearly a\r\nvery different thing.[462] It is no consolation to a family which has\r\nbeen evicted from a prosperous farm to be told that it can settle on a\r\nmoor or a marsh, on Blackstone Edge or Deeping Fen. To argue that\r\nenclosing was of little consequence, because so small a proportion of\r\nthe total land area was enclosed, is almost precisely similar to arguing\r\nthat overcrowding is of little consequence, because the area of Great\r\nBritain divided by the population gives a quotient of about one and a\r\nhalf acres to every human being in the country. The evidence of a\r\ngeneral trend of opinion during a century and a half--opinion by no\r\nmeans confined to the peasants, or to the peasants' champions like\r\nHales, or to idealists like Sir Thomas More, or to the preachers of\r\nsocial righteousness like Latimer and Crowley, but shared by Wolsey and\r\nThomas Cromwell in the earlier part of the century, Robert Cecil and\r\nFrancis Bacon[463] at the end of it--to the effect that the agrarian\r\nchanges caused extensive depopulation, is really a firmer basis for\r\njudging their effects than are statistics which, however carefully\r\nworked up, are necessarily unreliable, and which, when reliable, are not\r\nquite the statistics required. When that opinion is backed by\r\ndocumentary proof that from one village thirty persons, from another\r\nfifty, from another the whole population, were displaced, though of\r\ncourse we cannot say that such displacement was general, we can say that\r\nit was not unknown, and that if contemporaries were guilty of\r\nexaggeration (as they probably were), their exaggeration took the form\r\nnot of inventing extreme cases, but of suggesting that such extreme\r\ncases were the rule. On the whole, therefore, our conclusions as to the\r\nquantitative measurement of depopulation caused in the sixteenth century\r\nmust still, in spite of the researches of Mr. Leadam and Professor Gay,\r\nbe a negative one. In the first place, we cannot say, even\r\napproximately, what proportion of the total landholding population was\r\ndisplaced. In the second place, such figures as we do possess are not of\r\na kind to outweigh the direct evidence of contemporary observers that\r\nthe movement was so extensive as in parts of England to cause serious\r\nsuffering and disturbance.\r\n\r\n    [462] Professor Pollard has good remarks on this point\r\n    (_Political History of England_, 1547-1603, p. 29).\r\n\r\n    [463] Wolsey was responsible for the Commission of 1517. For a\r\n    letter of Cromwell to Henry VIII. on the subject of enclosure,\r\n    and for the views of Cecil and Bacon, see below, pp. 273-274,\r\n    279, 343, 387.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) _The Agrarian Changes and the Poor Law_\r\n\r\nThe obscurity in which the statistics of depopulation are involved does\r\nnot prevent us from seeing that it played an important part in providing\r\nan incentive to the organisation of relief on a national and secular\r\nbasis, which was the most enduring achievement of the social legislation\r\nof sixteenth century statesmen. An influential theory of Poor Law\r\nHistory regards the admission finally made in 1601 that the destitute\r\nperson has, not only a moral, but a legal, right to maintenance, as a\r\nlast fatal legacy handed to the modern state by the expiring social\r\norder of the Middle Ages, a relic of villeinage which was given a\r\nstatutory basis at the very moment when a little more patience would\r\nhave shown that a national system of poor relief was not only\r\nunnecessary, but positively harmful, in the new mobile society which the\r\nexpansion of commerce and industry was bringing into existence.\r\n\"Serfdom,\" says an eminent exponent of this view, \"is itself a system of\r\nPoor Law. The Poor Law is not therefore a new device invented in the\r\ntime of Elizabeth to meet a new disease. The very conception of a\r\nsociety based on status involves the conception of a Poor Law far more\r\nsearching and rigid than the celebrated 43 Eng. cap. 2.... The\r\ncollective provision is appropriate to the then expiring condition of\r\nstatus.... A wide diffusion of private property, not collective\r\nproperty, is the obvious and natural method by which the unable-bodied\r\nperiods of life are to be met. With the disappearance of Feudalism we\r\nmight have expected that there would have disappeared the custom which\r\nmade the poor a charge upon the manor or parish of which they had\r\nformerly been serfs. This, however, did not happen, and a history of\r\nthis survival of mediæval custom is the history of the English Poor\r\nLaw.... To sum the matter up:--In following the development of Poor Law\r\nlegislation, we watch society struggling to free itself from the fetters\r\nof a primitive communism of poverty and subjection, a state of things\r\npossessing many 'plausible advantages.' Legislation for the management\r\nof the Poor often impeded, and only occasionally expedited, this\r\nbeneficent process.... It proceeded from ignorance of the true nature of\r\nprogress, and from a denial or neglect of the power of absorption\r\npossessed by a free society.\"[464] It is obvious that in this passage\r\nMr. Mackay uses his interpretation of Poor Law origins to make a very\r\ntrenchant criticism upon the whole principle involved in the public\r\nmaintenance of the destitute. That principle was not introduced because\r\nnew conditions made its adoption indispensable. It survived from an\r\nolder order of things into a world in which the only serious causes of\r\ndestitution are personal and not economic, and in which therefore it is\r\nquite inappropriate. To tolerate it is to drag for ever a clanking\r\nchain, one end of which is fastened round the bleeding ankles of modern\r\nsociety, and the other anchored in the hideous provisions of the Statute\r\nof Labourers. Nor should we be wrong if we said that a similar theory,\r\nthough less lucidly expressed, has had a considerable influence upon\r\nPoor Law practice. For the idea of a Poor Law as an anachronism which is\r\nquite out of place in a developed economic society is implied more than\r\nonce in the celebrated report drafted by Senior and Chadwick in 1834,\r\nand has passed from that brilliant piece of special pleading into the\r\nminds of three generations of administrators. \"A person,\" they state,\r\n\"who attributes pauperism to the inability to procure employment, will\r\ndoubt the efficiency of the cause which we propose to remove it,\"\r\nwhereas \"whenever inquiries have been made as to the previous condition\r\nof the able-bodied individuals who live in such numbers on the town\r\nparishes, it has been found that the pauperism of the greater number has\r\noriginated in indolence, improvidence, and vice, and might have been\r\navoided by ordinary care and industry. The majority of the Statutes\r\nconnected with the administration of public relief have created new\r\nevils, and aggravated those which they were intended to prevent.\"[465]\r\n\r\n    [464] Mackay, _History of the English Poor Law_, 1834-1898, pp.\r\n    10-11, 16-17.\r\n\r\n    [465] _Poor Law Commission Report of 1834_, pp. 264-277, 281.\r\n\r\nA discussion of Poor Law theory and history falls outside the limits of\r\nthis essay. But in forming an estimate of the effects of the agrarian\r\nchanges which have been described above, it is perhaps not out of place\r\nto consider the minor question of the connection between them and the\r\nsystem of Poor Relief which took its final shape in the reign of\r\nElizabeth. Since the distress which the relief institutions of an age\r\nexist to meet stands to its general economic conditions in the relation\r\nof reverse to obverse, of effect to cause, of disease to environment,\r\nmuch light is thrown on the economic difficulties most characteristic of\r\nany period by ascertaining the type of distress with which relieving\r\nauthorities are most generally confronted. Equally important, any\r\nstudent of Poor Law History, who is not the partisan of a theory, finds\r\nhimself constantly driven to look for an explanation of Poor Law\r\ndevelopments in regions which, at first sight, appear to lie far outside\r\nhis immediate subject, but where, in reality, is grown the grim harvest\r\nwhich it is the duty of Poor Law authorities, often acting in complete\r\nignorance of its origin, to reap. Much wild theorising and some tragic\r\npractical blunders might have been avoided, had it been more generally\r\nrealised that, of all branches of administration, the treatment of\r\npersons in distress is that which can least bear to be left to the\r\nexclusive attention of Poor Law specialists, because it, most of all\r\nmatters, depends for its success on being carefully adapted to the\r\nchanging economic conditions, the organisation or disorganisation of\r\nindustry, the stability or instability of trade, the diffusion or\r\nconcentration of property, by which the nature and extent of the\r\ndistress requiring treatment are determined.\r\n\r\nWhen one turns to the age in which the Poor Law took shape, the first\r\nthing to strike one is that the need for it arises, according to the\r\nviews expressed by most writers of the period, from that very\r\ndevelopment in commercial relationships, that very increase in economic\r\nmobility, which Mr. Mackay seems to imply should have made it\r\nunnecessary. The special feature of sixteenth century pauperism is\r\nwritten large over all the documents of the period--in Statutes, in\r\nPrivy Council proceedings, in the records of Quarter Sessions. The new\r\nand terrible problem is the increase in vagrancy. The sixteenth century\r\nlives in terror of the tramp. He is denounced by moralists, analysed\r\ninto species by the curious or scientific, scourged and buffeted by all\r\nmen. The destitution of the aged and impotent, of fatherless children\r\nand widows, is familiar enough. It has been with the world from time\r\nimmemorial. It has been for centuries the object of voluntary\r\ncharitable effort; and when the dissolution of the monasteries dries up\r\none great channel of provision, the Government intervenes with special\r\narrangements[466] to take their place a whole generation before it can\r\nbe brought to admit that there is any problem of the unemployed, other\r\nthan the problem of the sturdy rogue. The distinction between the\r\nable-bodied unemployed and the impotent is one which is visible to the\r\neye of sense. The distinction between the man who is unemployed because\r\nhe cannot get work and the man who is unemployed because he does not\r\nwant work, requires a modicum of knowledge and reflection which even at\r\nthe present day is not always forthcoming. The former distinction,\r\ntherefore, is not supplemented by the latter until the beginning of the\r\nlast quarter of the century.[467] In one respect, that of the Law of\r\nSettlement, the English Poor Law does show traces of a mediæval origin.\r\nIn all other respects, so far from being a survival from the Middle\r\nAges, it comes into existence just at the time when mediæval economic\r\nconditions are disappearing. It is not accepted at once as a matter of\r\ncourse that the destitute shall be publicly relieved, still less that\r\nthe able-bodied destitute deserve anything but punishment. Governments\r\nmake desperate efforts for about one hundred years to evade their new\r\nobligations. They whip and brand and bore ears; they offer the vagrant\r\nas a slave to the man who seizes him; they appeal to charity; they\r\nintroduce the parish clergy to put pressure on the uncharitable; they\r\ndirect the bishops to reason with those who stop their ears against the\r\nparish clergy. When merely repressive measures and voluntary effort are\r\nfinally discredited, they levy a compulsory charge rather as a fine for\r\ncontumacy than as a rate, and slide reluctantly into obligatory\r\nassessments[468] only when all else has failed. And if we ask why the\r\nobligation of maintaining the destitute should have received national\r\nrecognition first in the sixteenth century, we can only answer by\r\npointing to that trend away from the stationary conditions of\r\nagriculture to the fluctuating conditions of trade, and in particular to\r\nthat displacement of the rural population, which we have already seen\r\nwas one result of enclosure. The national Poor Law is not a mediæval\r\nanachronism. It is the outcome of conditions which seem to the men of\r\nthe sixteenth century new and appalling. Of these conditions the most\r\nimportant are the agrarian changes.\r\n\r\n    [466] 27 Hen. VIII., c. 25. Under this Act city and county\r\n    authorities are to relieve impotent beggars \"by way of voluntary\r\n    and charitable alms.\" They are also for the first time given\r\n    power to apprentice vagrant children.\r\n\r\n    [467] 18 Eliz. c. 3 directed that a stock of wool, flax, hemp,\r\n    iron, or other stuff should be provided in cities, corporate\r\n    towns, and market towns. The important words which show the\r\n    change of opinion are, \"To the intente also that ... Roges ...\r\n    may not have any just excuse in saying they cannot get any\r\n    service or work.\"\r\n\r\n    [468] 14 Eliz. c. 5.\r\n\r\nLet us try for a moment to put ourselves in the position of a family\r\nwhich has been evicted from its holding to make room for sheep. When the\r\nlast stick of furniture has been tumbled out by the bailiff, where, poor\r\nhouseless wretches, are they to turn? They cannot get work in their old\r\nhome, even if they can get lodgings, for the attraction of sheep-farming\r\nis that the wage bill is so low. Will they emigrate from England like\r\nthe Scotch crofters? There are people who in the seventeenth century\r\nwill advise them to seek a haven with the godly folk who have crossed\r\nthe Atlantic, who will argue that England is overstocked, that \"there is\r\nsuch pressing and oppressing in town and country about farms, trades,\r\ntraffic, so as a man can hardly anywhere set up a trade but he shall\r\npull down two of his neighbours,\" and point out that \"the country is\r\nreplenished with new farmers, and the almhouses are filled with old\r\nlabourers,\" that \"the rent-taker lives on sweet morsels, but the\r\nrent-payer eats a dry crust often with watery eyes.\"[469] But enclosures\r\nhave been going on for a century before the plantations exist to offer a\r\nrefuge, and in any case the probability of the country folk hearing of\r\nthem is very remote. Can a man migrate to seek work in another part of\r\nthe country? Not easily, for, apart from the enormous practical\r\ndifficulties, the law puts obstacles in his way, and the law is backed\r\nup with enthusiasm by every parish and town in the country. There are\r\nthree possible attitudes which a State may adopt towards the questions\r\narising from the ebb and flow of population. It may argue, with the\r\noptimists of 1834, that the mobility of labour is a good thing, a\r\nsymptom of alertness and energy, and that it will take place of itself\r\nto the extent which is economically desirable, provided that no\r\nimpediments are placed in the way of those who desire to better\r\nthemselves by looking for work elsewhere. Or, while believing that it is\r\nmuch to be desired that people should migrate freely from place to place\r\nin search of employment, it may nevertheless reflect that the mere\r\nabsence of restrictions does not in fact stimulate such movement, and\r\ntherefore take upon itself its encouragement through the publication of\r\ninformation and the registration of unemployed workers. Or,\r\nsubordinating economic to political considerations, it may hold that the\r\nmovement of a large number of unemployed persons up and down the country\r\nis not an indication of a praiseworthy spirit of enterprise, but a\r\nmenace to public order which must be sternly repressed. We need hardly\r\nsay that this last view is the one characteristic of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. The attitude towards the man on tramp in search of employment\r\nis exactly the opposite of that which is held at the present day. He is\r\nnot less, but much more, culpable than he who remains in his own parish\r\nand lives on his neighbours. He is assumed not to be seeking work but to\r\nbe avoiding it, and avoiding it in a restless and disorderly manner.\r\nHear what the worthy Harrison says when the State has already made the\r\nprovision for the unemployed a charge upon each parish:--\"But if they\r\nrefuse to be supported by this benefit of the law, and will rather\r\nendeavour by going to and fro to maintain their idle trades, then are\r\nthey adjudged to be parcel of the third sort (_i.e._ wilful vagrants),\r\nand so, instead of courteous refreshing at home, are often corrected\r\nwith sharp execution and whip of justice abroad. Many there are which,\r\nnotwithstanding the rigour of the laws provided on that behalf, yield\r\nrather with this liberty (as they call it) to be daily under the fear\r\nand terror of the whip, than by abiding where they were born or bred, to\r\nbe provided for by the devotion of the parishes.\"[470] The village is\r\nstill thought of as the unit of employment. It is still regarded as\r\nbeing equipped with the means of finding work for all its inhabitants,\r\nas though there had been no movement towards pasture-farming to prick a\r\nhole in its economic self-sufficiency. The presumption, therefore, is\r\nagainst the man who leaves the parish where he is known to his\r\nneighbours. He must prove that he is going to take up work for which he\r\nis already engaged. He must get a licence from his last employer. As far\r\nas the able-bodied are concerned the Poor Law is in origin a measure of\r\nsocial police. Relief is thrown in as a makeweight, because by the end\r\nof the sixteenth century our statesmen have discovered that when\r\neconomic pressure reaches a certain point they cannot control men\r\nwithout it. The whip has no terrors for the man who must look for work\r\nor starve. So every Sunday after church, while Parson's sermon is still\r\nfresh in our minds, we board out our poor by rotation \"among such\r\nhouseholders as will maintain them meat and work and such wages as they\r\nshall deserve for the week following.\"[471] Heaven help us if the next\r\nparish does not do the same!\r\n\r\n    [469] Robert Cushman, \"Reasons and Considerations touching the\r\n    Lawfulness of Removing out of England into the parts of America\"\r\n    (printed by E. Arber, _The Story of the Pilgrim Fathers_).\r\n\r\n    [470] Harrison in _Elizabethan England_ (Withington), chap. x.\r\n\r\n    [471] _Hist. MSS.

In spite of all the obstacles\r\nin the way of migration, in spite of whip and courteous refreshment, men\r\ndo in fact migrate, and not only men, but women and children. By the\r\nlatter part of the century, at any rate, statesmen have begun to\r\nunderstand that pauperism and vagrancy stand to the depopulation caused\r\nby enclosure in the relation of effect to cause. The revolution in the\r\nofficial attitude to the problem caused by this belated illumination is\r\nas great as that which has taken place in the last ten years with regard\r\nto unemployment. Once the new standpoint has been seized, though\r\nopinion, and the opinion not only of the ruling classes, but of\r\nburgesses and villagers, still treats the vagrant with iron severity, it\r\nnever quite relapses into the comfortable doctrine, the grand discovery\r\nof a commercial age, that distress is itself a proof of the demerits of\r\nits victim, and that Heaven, like a Utilitarian philosopher, permits\r\nthe existence of destitution only that it may make \"less eligible\" the\r\nlot of \"improvidence and vice.\" It is saved from this last error not by\r\nthe lore of economists, but because it regards economic questions\r\nthrough the eyes of a sturdy matter-of-fact morality. It is sufficiently\r\nenlightened to recognise that even among vagrants there is a class which\r\nis more sinned against than sinning, a class of whom it can be asked \"at\r\nwhose hands shall the blood of these men be required?\"[472] It is\r\nsufficiently ingenuous to answer by pointing to \"some covetous man\" who,\r\n\"espying a further commodity in their commons, holds, and tenures, doth\r\nfind such means as thereby to wipe many out of their occupyings and turn\r\nthe same unto his private gains.\"[473] Occasionally the effect of\r\nenclosures is brought home to the encloser in a practical way, by\r\ncompelling him not only to pay a fine to the Crown, but also to make a\r\ncontribution towards the relief of the poor whose numbers he has\r\nincreased.[474]\r\n\r\n    [472] Harrison, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n    [473] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [474] Camden Society, 1886. Cases in Courts of Star Chamber and\r\n    High Commission, Michaelmas, 7 Caroli, Case of Archer. (The\r\n    allusion in the text is to a precedent cited in this case.)\r\n\r\nTo see the way in which the relation between the problems of pauperism\r\nand of agrarian depopulation is regarded, turn to the debates in the\r\nHouse of Commons. In the year 1597, when both questions are acute (the\r\npreceding year had seen a recrudescence of agrarian rioting), a member\r\nor minister, probably Robert Cecil, is preparing notes for a speech[475]\r\non the subject in Parliament. What are the points he emphasises? They\r\nare the high price of corn caused by bad harvests and the manipulations\r\nof middlemen, the enclosing of land and the conversion of arable to\r\npasture, which naturally intensifies the difficulty of securing adequate\r\nfood supplies, \"the decaying and plucking down of houses, ... and not\r\nonly the plucking down of some few houses, but the depopulating of whole\r\ntowns ... and keeping of a shepherd only, whereby many subjects are\r\nturned without habitation, and fill the country with rogues and idle\r\npersons.\" When Parliament meets in October, the House is at once busy\r\nwith different aspects of the same question.[476] Bills are introduced\r\ndealing with forestallers, regrators, and engrossers of corn, with\r\nvagrancy and pauperism, and with enclosures, and a committee is\r\nappointed to consider the latter question. In the debates which follow\r\nthere is the usual division of opinion between the champions of economic\r\nreform and the advocates of more, and more ruthless, \"deterrence,\"\r\nbetween those who wish to legislate as to causes and those who are\r\nmainly occupied with symptoms. Bacon, master as ever of the science of\r\nhis subject, insists with invincible logic that pauperism is one part of\r\nthe general agrarian problem, and he is supported by Robert Cecil. On\r\nthe other hand, the experts as to pauperism--we can imagine the county\r\njustices fresh from their whippings and relief committees and houses of\r\ncorrection, fresh, too, from enclosure and depopulation--complain that\r\ntheir special subject is being overlooked in a general and dangerous\r\ndiscussion on the economic causes of distress, and that the committee\r\n\"has spent all their travel about the said enclosures and tillage, and\r\nnothing about the said rogues and poor.\" That this should have been the\r\npopular line to take needs no explanation. A Parliament which dares\r\ndiscuss not only how to manipulate the lives of the poor, but the\r\nfundamental causes of their misery, is a Parliament which the eye of man\r\nhad not yet, has not yet, beheld. Compared with other representative\r\nassemblies, compared with itself at a later date, the Elizabethan House\r\nof Commons, debating in an age when it could be said that government was\r\n\"nothing but a certein conspiracy of riche men procuringe theire owne\r\ncommodities under the name and title of the Common Wealth,\" had the\r\ngrace to show some stirrings of compunction. If members who had grown\r\nfat on the tragedy which they were discussing spoke of their victims as\r\nmembers will speak, ministers at least were independent, and could\r\nventure, like Cecil, to tell the House unpalatable truths. Of the two\r\nActs against enclosure, which were the result of this session's\r\ndeliberations, we shall speak later. What is worth noticing here is the\r\ndisposition, even in a Parliament composed of country gentlemen, to\r\nemphasise the connection between the problems with which anti-enclosure\r\nand anti-vagrancy legislation have to deal. It is summed up in the\r\neloquent peroration of a nameless member. \"As this bill entered at first\r\nwith a short prayer, 'God speed the plough,' so I wish it may end with\r\nsuch success as the plough shall speed the poor.\"[477]\r\n\r\n    [475] _Hist.

There is no\r\ncertain information to guide us. The tragedy of the tramp is his\r\nisolation. Every man's hand is against him; and his history is\r\ninevitably written by his enemies. Yet, beneath denunciations hurled\r\nupon him by those who lived warm and slept soft, we can see two\r\nmovements going on, two waves in a vast and silent ebbing of population\r\nfrom its accustomed seats. In the first place there is a steady\r\nimmigration into the towns on the part of those \"who, being driven out\r\nof their habitations, are forced into the great cities, where, being\r\nvery burdensome, men shut their doors against them, suffering them to\r\ndie in the streets and highways.\"[478] The municipal records of the\r\nperiods teem with complaints of the disorder, the overcrowding, the\r\nviolation of professional bye-laws, caused by rural immigration. The\r\ndisplaced peasant is the Irishman of the sixteenth century, and, like\r\nthe Irishman, he makes his very misery a whip with which to scourge, not\r\nalas! his oppressors, but men who often are not much less wretched than\r\nhimself. He turns whole quarters into slums, spreads disease through\r\ncongested town dwellings, and disorganises the labour market by crowding\r\nout the native artisan. Gild members find themselves eaten up by\r\nunlawful men who have never served an apprenticeship in the town, and\r\nretort with regulations requiring the deposit of a prohibitive sum as an\r\nentrance fee from all immigrants who want to set up shop, especially\r\nfrom those wretches who are thought to have a large family of children,\r\nat present snugly concealed in their last place of residence, but soon\r\nto be surreptitiously introduced, a brood of hungry young cuckoos, if\r\nonce their parents get a footing in the town.[479] Borough authorities,\r\nwho see cottages \"made down\" into tenements in which pestilence spreads\r\nwith fearful rapidity, seek to stamp out the very possibility of\r\ninvasion by prohibiting the erection of new cottages or the subdivision\r\nof old. To judge by their behaviour, the notorious Statute of 1662,\r\nwhich codified the existing customs as to settlement, must have been one\r\nof the most popular pieces of legislation ever passed by Parliament.\r\nTown[480] after town in the course of the sixteenth century tries to\r\nprotect itself by a system of stringent inspection worthy of modern\r\nGermany. Sometimes there is a regular expulsion of the aliens.\r\n\"Forasmuch as it is found by daily experience,\" declare the authorities\r\nof Nottingham,[481] \"that by the continual building and erecting of new\r\ncottages and poor habitations, and by the transferring of barns and\r\nsuchlike buildings into cottages, and also by the great confluence of\r\nmany poor people from forrein parts out of this towne to inhabit here,\r\nand lykewise by the usual and frequent taking in of inmates into many\r\npoor habitations here, the poorer sort of people do much increase ... it\r\nis ordered that no burgess or freeman on pain of £5 erect any cottage or\r\nconvert any building into a cottage in the town without license of the\r\nMayor, that no burgess or freeman, without a license, receive any one\r\nfrom the country as a tenant, that every landlord be bound in the sum of\r\n£10 to remove all foreign tenants who have entered in the last three\r\nyears before May 1st next.\" What most boroughs do for themselves is\r\nfinally, after many regulations have been made by the Common Council,\r\ndone for London by Parliamentary legislation. It is not a chance that\r\nthe end of Elizabeth's reign sees the first two Housing Acts, one[482]\r\nin 1589, enacting that only one family may live in a house, the\r\nother[483] applying to London alone, and forbidding the division of\r\nhouses into tenements, the receiving of lodgers, or the erection of new\r\nhouses for persons who are assessed in the subsidy book at less than £5\r\nin goods or £3 in lands. The evicted peasants are beginning to take\r\ntheir revenge. They have been taking it ever since.\r\n\r\n    [478] Lansd.

The families displaced by enclosure cannot easily\r\nenter into industry, even if they wish to do so, for the avenue to most\r\ntrades is blocked both by the Corporations and by the statutory system\r\nof a seven years' apprenticeship, which maintains professional standards\r\nat the expense of an unprivileged residuum. What they do is to follow\r\nthe orthodox advice given to those who have lost their customary means\r\nof livelihood. They proceed to colonise, and to colonise in such numbers\r\nthat they cannot easily be kept out. They settle as squatters on the\r\nwaste lands of those manors which have not been enclosed, and which,\r\nbefore the waste is turned into a sheep-run, offer no obstacle to\r\nimmigration. That the possibility of using the manorial waste to\r\naccommodate those who had no settled abode had occurred to statesmen as\r\none expedient for meeting the problem of the infirm and destitute, is\r\nshown by the sanction expressly given in the Poor Law of 1597[484] to\r\nthe expenditure of parish funds on the erection of cottages on the waste\r\nas residences for the impotent poor. In fact, however, the mobility of\r\nlabour was becoming such that it was impossible, even if it had been\r\ndesirable, to reserve those unutilised territories for the maintenance\r\nof the impotent. In spite of bitter protests from the existing\r\ninhabitants, refugees from other villages swarm down upon them in such\r\nnumbers that the Act requiring four acres of land to be attached to each\r\ncottage cannot be observed, and the issuing of licences for the erection\r\nof cottages on the waste for able-bodied men, who have come with their\r\nfamilies from a distance, becomes a regular part of the business of\r\nQuarter Sessions.[485] Such a redistribution of the population solves\r\none problem only to create others. Stern economists in the seventeenth\r\ncentury lament that the ease with which permission to build cottages on\r\nthe waste is obtained encourages the existence of an improvident and\r\nidle class, which will neither work for wages nor make good use of the\r\nland. \"In all or most towns where the fields lie open and are used in\r\ncommon, there is a new brood of upstart intruders as inmates, and the\r\ninhabitants of unlawful cottages erected contrary unto law.... Loyterers\r\nwho will not usually be got to work unless they may have such excessive\r\nwages as they themselves desire.\"[486] The opponents of enclosure answer\r\nwith some justice that, in effect, the open field villages are saddled\r\nwith the destitution caused by enclosing landlords, who first ruin their\r\ntenants and then, like a modern Dock Company which relies on the Poor\r\nRate to save its wage-bill, leave them to be supported by those places\r\nto which they are compelled to migrate.[487] The latter difficulty is\r\nindeed a very serious one, which not only is the occasion of numberless\r\npetitions[488] from villages who wish to be assisted by, or to avoid\r\nassisting, their neighbours, but on occasion converts even the country\r\ngentry into opponents of enclosure. \"We further conceive,\" write the\r\nJustices of Nottingham to the Council, \"that if depopulation may be\r\nreformed it will bring a great good to the whole Kingdom; for where\r\nhomes are pulled down the people are forced to seek new habitations in\r\nother towns and countries, whereof those towns where they get a settling\r\nare pestered so as they are hardly able to live one by another, and it\r\nis likewise the cause of erecting new cottages upon the waste and other\r\nplaces who are not able to relieve themselves ... which causes rogues\r\nand vagabonds to increase.\"[489] In the elaborate book of Poor Law\r\norders published in 1631 the Government recognises the genuineness of\r\nthis grievance, and, to its direction that richer parishes should\r\ncontribute funds to the aid of the poor, adds a special rider pointing\r\nout that such extra contributions would come with special\r\nappropriateness from those places where there had been depopulation.\r\n\r\n    [484] 39 Eliz. c. 3.\r\n\r\n    [485] For petitions on this subject see _Hist.

Fforasmuch as this Court was this present day\r\n    informed ... by Sir Edward Marrowe, kt., and Thomas Ashley as\r\n    the lords of the manor of Woolvey in this county ... that the\r\n    said lords are content that William Wilcox of Woolvey in this\r\n    countie shall build and erect a cottage for hys habitation hys\r\n    wyfe and his small children uppon the waste within the said\r\n    lordshippe, it is therefore ordered that the same being with\r\n    consent of the lord as aforesaid that the same cottage shall be\r\n    and continue,\" and later \"which cottage the Court doth licence\"\r\n    (_Warwick Quarter Sessions MSS.

When the demesne land is enclosed and converted to\r\npasture, there is an appreciable diminution in the demand for labour,\r\nand consequently an increase in unemployment. When the common rights of\r\ntenants are curtailed, they lose not only an important subsidiary source\r\nof income, but often, at the same time, the means of cultivating their\r\narable holdings. When their holdings are merged in the great estate of\r\nthe capitalist farmer, they are turned adrift to seek their living in a\r\nworld where most trades and most towns are barred against them, where\r\nthey are punished if they do not find work, and punished if they look\r\nfor work without permission, where \"if the poor being thrust out of\r\ntheir houses go to dwell with others, straight we catch them with the\r\nStatute of Inmates; if they wander abroad, they are in danger of the\r\nStatute of the Poor to be whipped.\"[490] Thus, quite apart both from the\r\neternal source of poverty which consists in the recalcitrance of nature\r\nto human effort, and from those causes of individual destitution which\r\nin all ages and in all economic conditions lie in wait for the\r\nexceptionally unfortunate or the exceptionally improvident, for the\r\nsick, the aged, and the orphan, there is an increase in the number of\r\nthose for whom access to the land, their customary means of livelihood,\r\nis unobtainable, and consequently a multiplication of the residuum for\r\nwhom the haunting insecurity of the propertyless modern labourer is, not\r\nthe exception, but the normal lot. It is this extension of destitution\r\namong able-bodied men, who have the will, but not the means, to find\r\nemployment, which is the peculiar feature of sixteenth century\r\npauperism, and which leads in 1576 to the most characteristic expedient\r\nof the Elizabethan Poor Law--the provision of materials upon which the\r\nunemployed can be set to work. The recognition that the relief of the\r\ndestitute must be enforced as a public obligation was not the\r\nconsequence of the survival of mediæval ideas into an age where they\r\nwere out of place, but an attempt on the part of the powerful Tudor\r\nstate to prevent the social disorder caused by economic changes, which,\r\nin spite of its efforts, it had not been strong enough to control.\r\n\r\n    [490] _D'Ewes' Journal._ Speech of Cecil, 1597.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF TENANT RIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) _The Tenants at Will and the Leaseholders_\r\n\r\nWe have said above that we cannot measure the extent of the depopulation\r\ncaused by enclosure, even for those years with regard to which figures\r\nare supplied us by Royal Commissions. But, after all, it is happily less\r\nimportant to arrive at an exact statistical estimate of the acres\r\nenclosed and of the number of tenants displaced, than it is to get a\r\ngeneral view of the economic forces at work and of the structure of\r\nlegal relationships upon which they operated. Given the economic reasons\r\nfor the consolidation of holdings which were dominant in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, they could hardly have failed to result in evictions on a\r\nconsiderable scale, unless the tenants themselves had sufficient legal\r\nsecurity to hold their own. If they had such security, the statistical\r\nanalysis of displacements given above will fall into line with the\r\ngeneral situation and be a valuable comment upon it. If they had not,\r\nthen the figures, while a useful guide to the imagination, may stand\r\nwhen they confirm, but hardly when they contradict, the picture given by\r\ncontemporaries. The accounts of the latter, though still not freed from\r\nthe charge of exaggeration, will be supported by what we know of the\r\ngeneral disposition of economic and legal forces. They probably heighten\r\nthe colour and sharpen the outlines, but their indication of tendencies\r\nwill be correct.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the position of the small cultivator in the sixteenth\r\ncentury it was pointed out above that similarity of legal status was\r\ncompatible with the greatest economic variety, and in considering their\r\nability to resist attempted eviction it is essential to remember the\r\nconverse truth, that tenants who were economically in a similar position\r\nwere often from the point of view of tenure very different. Just as\r\nwriters of the time lump together all classes of well-to-do small\r\nlandholders under the name of yeomen, though the majority of them were\r\nnot legally yeomen at all, so they constantly speak of evictions,\r\nruinous fines, and rack-rents, without discriminating between the\r\ndifferent classes of tenants whose different legal positions make them\r\nliable to suffer in very different degrees. One must remember, again,\r\nthat in the sixteenth century a man might be called a copyholder because\r\nhe held a copyhold tenement, but at the same time he might have, and\r\nvery often had, additional land which he had leased from the demesne or\r\nfrom the waste, and in which his legal interest was quite different; he\r\nmight be a freeholder and at the same time be the farmer who leased the\r\nlord's demesne, or he might be freeholder, copyholder, and leaseholder\r\nin one, and even hold at the will of the lord other land which he had\r\nbeen allowed to occupy \"by grant of the court,\" for example part of the\r\nmanorial waste. Hence not only were the positions of tenants at will,\r\nlessees, and copyholders considered as classes, different from each\r\nother, but there was also a difference in the legal interest which\r\nindividuals had in different parts of the lands which they cultivated.\r\nEven if the law gave protection to copyholders, a point to be discussed\r\nlater, they might suffer from the consolidation into large farms of\r\nthose parts of their lands which they did not hold by copy, and the more\r\nthey had gained in preceding years by adding to their holdings of\r\ncustomary land by leasing part of the demesne and of the waste, the\r\nheavier would be their loss when these additions were taken from them,\r\nwhile those whose holdings consisted entirely of such encroachments\r\nwould be altogether ruined. Again, on those few manors where tenure at\r\nthe will of the lord had not crystallised into copyhold, the tenant's\r\nposition was even weaker than that of the lessee, for there was nothing\r\nbut a custom unenforced by legal documents to prevent his eviction.\r\n\r\nThere was thus opportunity for a considerable displacement of population\r\nwithout any need of raising the difficult question of the degree of\r\nsecurity enjoyed by copyhold tenure. When a manor was occupied only by\r\ntenants at will without copies, or when its demesne lands were leased\r\nfor short terms to a number of lessees, or when its waste had been\r\ngradually taken in either by new settlers or by the customary tenants,\r\nland could be resumed by the lord without any conflict save, in the\r\nfirst case, with a custom which two centuries before had been powerful\r\nbut now was weak, and in the second case with a terminable interest. It\r\nis not necessary to adduce instances to prove the liability of the\r\ntenant at will or lessee to eviction, because the nature of their\r\ninterest makes it obvious that they could not claim to have complete\r\nlegal security. Examples of the first kind are, indeed, not very common,\r\nowing to the fact that by our period tenure at will of the lord had in\r\nmost places hardened into copyhold, and their comparative rarity may\r\nsuggest that tenants at will who had not become copyholders had been\r\ndisplaced on most manors by the beginning of the century. The case of\r\ntwo Wiltshire manors may serve to illustrate their position. At\r\nKnyghton[491] the whole manor was in 1554 leased to a farmer, and with\r\nthe manor the rents and service of six customary tenants holding at\r\nwill. At Domerham,[492] in 1568, almost the whole of the land was in the\r\nhands of three large farmers, but \"it has been granted to Richard\r\nCompton, Thomas Pryce, John Pryce, and Robert Kynge, to sow of the above\r\nsaid land every year 120 acres.\" In the second case the precariousness\r\nof the tenants' position is obvious; they are mere squatters, who are\r\nthere, as it were, on sufferance. In the first case it has been\r\nrecognised and mitigated, as far as the farmer is concerned, by a clause\r\nin his agreement binding him to leave the tenants in peaceable enjoyment\r\nas long as they pay their rents. But they have no security as against\r\nthe lord, and are liable to immediate eviction if it proves more\r\nprofitable to add their holdings to the large farm. When tenants\r\ncommence an action against a lord for wrongful disseisin, it is\r\nsufficient for him to answer that they are \"but his tenantry at\r\nwyll.\"[493]\r\n\r\n    [491] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Pembroke Manors_.\r\n\r\n    [492] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [493] Leadam, _English Hist. Rev._, vol. viii. pp. 684-696.\r\n\r\nMuch more numerous, however, than the tenants at will, were the small\r\nleaseholders who held part of the waste or of the demesne lands. A\r\nglance at the table given on page 25 will show that they form about 12\r\nper cent. of the whole manorial population therein represented. But in\r\nparts of the country their numbers are far greater. In 1568 they form 20\r\nper cent. of the landholders on four manors in Somersetshire and one in\r\nDevonshire.[494] In two villages in Northamptonshire[495] they form\r\nnearly two-thirds. On the great manor of Rochdale there are in 1626 as\r\nmany as 315 leaseholders to 64 freeholders and 233 copyholders.\r\nLeaseholders possessed, of course, legal security during the period of\r\ntheir leases, and these were in some cases for as long as ninety-two\r\nyears. But they, too, had not an interest in the land of the kind which\r\nwould enable them to offer any permanent barrier to the policy of\r\nconsolidating holdings. This fact, indeed, was the motive for the care\r\nwhich surveyors showed in discriminating between those parts of the\r\ntenants' holdings which were customary land and those which were made up\r\nof pieces taken from the demesne or from the waste, as well as for the\r\ndesire to convert copyhold tenure into leases for years, which was often\r\nshown in the sixteenth century by the manorial officials. For an example\r\nillustrating the eviction of numerous small tenants who had leased the\r\ndemesne we may recur to the case of Ablode[496] which has been mentioned\r\nabove. The lease of that manor to a farmer made by the monastery of St.\r\nPeter's in 1516 expressly provided that he should be allowed to get rid\r\nof the lessees, to whom the demesne lands had previously been let, as\r\nsoon as their leases should have expired. Two other examples show the\r\nsame class encountering exactly the same difficulty under somewhat\r\ndifferent circumstances. The first, which relates to the waste, not to\r\nthe demesne lands, comes from a survey of the lordship of Bromfield and\r\nGale which was made by the Parliamentary surveyors in 1649.[497] \"The\r\ninclosures before mentioned,\" they say, \"and all the rest of them within\r\nthe lordship of Bromfield and Gale, fall to the lord of the soyle,\r\nbecause enclosed without license. For although by their fee farm estate\r\nthey [_i.e._ the tenants] may challenge freedome of commoning, it is by\r\nthe covenant of the grant as formerly and antiently was accustomed, so\r\nthat they must take a new grant of all (except some old inclosures which\r\nare included in their fee farms), which is the custom of the lordshippe.\r\n_And if they should enclose all their common, yet the lord would have a\r\nthird part._\" The second illustration is given by a petition which some\r\nleasehold tenants of Whitby Strand[498] promoted in the Court of\r\nRequests in the year 1553. When the monastery of Whitby was dissolved,\r\nits property passed first to the Crown, which disposed of it to the Duke\r\nof Northumberland, who in turn sold it to Sir John Yorke. The sufferings\r\nof the tenants may be told in their own words: \"Which saide Sir John, of\r\nhis extort power and might and by great and sore threatenings of the\r\nsaid tennants ... hathe gotten from them all the leases ... and\r\nunreasonably hathe raised rents ... and in consideration also that the\r\nsaid Sir John York is a man of power and might, landes, goodes and\r\npossessions; greatly frendid.... Your poor oratours ... are not able to\r\nsue against him,\" and petition the Court for redress. The reality of\r\ntheir grievance is shown sufficiently by the fact that whereas, when the\r\nestate was in the hands of the monastery, the total rents of twenty-six\r\ntenants amounted to £28, 19s. 8-1/2d., an average of about £1, 2s. 1d.\r\nper tenant, by the date of these complaints the rents alone, apart from\r\nfines, had been forced up to £64, 9s. 9d., averaging per tenant £2, 6s.\r\n6d.\r\n\r\n    [494] _Ibid._, Paynton, Stooke Trister and Cucklington, Donyett,\r\n    Chedseye, South Brent and Huish.

It is\r\nsurely the special precariousness in the conditions of the sixteenth\r\ncentury of all those tenants whose livelihood lies mainly in land which\r\nhas been taken from the demesne or from the waste, which is, in fact, in\r\nthe words of Fitzherbert,[499] \"a new thing that hath not gone by\r\ncustom,\" a thing which may \"fortune to increase or decrease of rent.\" A\r\npiece of demesne may have been let out on lease at a low rent in the\r\nyear following the great plague, or have been taken from the waste at an\r\neven earlier date. It may have remained in the hands of one family for\r\na century without being resumed by the lord, and without any attempt\r\nbeing made to increase the tenants' payments. It may have been cleared\r\nand cleaned, hedged and ditched, by the sweat of generations. But, if\r\nthe manorial officials have done their duty, that land has been marked\r\nas a \"new thing,\" something for which no custom can be pleaded and which\r\nno prescription can protect. When the lord wishes to alter the condition\r\nof its tenure no vested interest can stand against him. He will throw it\r\ninto a large farm, or double the rent, and the tenants can say nothing;\r\nfor they are mere lessees, unprotected by the sanctity of manorial\r\ncustom, and to have his way he need only wait till their leases expire.\r\nThat this is no impossible supposition is shown by the records of the\r\nmanor of Hewlington.[500] In 1562 an inquiry was made into the rights of\r\nthe tenants there, who seem to have been lessees for the term of forty\r\nyears with a right of renewal to the heir. On investigation being made\r\nby the officers of the Crown, to whom the manor belonged, it was found\r\nthat there was \"a decay of the sum of one hundred and five pounds, six\r\nshillings, yearly rent, which in ancient tymes had been answered for the\r\nsaid landes\"; which decay \"as by the auncient records appeareth, did\r\ngrowe by reason of the great mortalitie and plague which in former tymes\r\nhad been in the reign of Edward III. and also of the Rebellion of Owen\r\nGlendower and trouble that therefrom ensued; ... by reason of which\r\nmortalitie and rebellion the country was wasted, the Tenants and their\r\nhouses destroyed, insomuch that the then lords of the soyle were\r\nconstrayned by their stewards and officers to graunte the said landes at\r\na lesser rent than formerlie was paid for the same to such as could be\r\ngotten to take it.\" Two hundred years after the great plague, its effect\r\nin reducing the rents of a few tenants on the Welsh Border is\r\nremembered: a commission calculates the sum due to the last penny, and\r\nis then required and authorised \"to revise the said decayed rent,\" a\r\nfact which the jurors of the manor duly record in their presentment made\r\nanother sixty years later. No doubt the Crown has an unusually good\r\nmemory--_nullum tempus occurrit regi_. But what the Crown can do on\r\nthis grand scale the surveyors of smaller lords do on a smaller one. As\r\nsoon as the time has come when it is convenient to get rid of tenants,\r\nnothing but the most unassailable title can stand against the proof that\r\nsuch and such a plot of land was once part of the lord's demesne or of\r\nthe lord's waste. And this, one may suspect, was a great change, which\r\naffected many families who thought themselves as safe as their\r\nneighbours. For at least two centuries before enclosing became general\r\nenough to cause alarm, the demesne and waste lands on one manor after\r\nanother had been nibbled away by small encroachments; for lords had been\r\nglad to find an alternative to the cultivation of the former through\r\nlabour services, and the colonising of the latter, though sometimes a\r\nsource of complaint with commoners whose rights of pasture were\r\ncurtailed, was welcomed by the manorial authorities as a means of\r\nimproving lands which would otherwise be useless. Both together had been\r\nin fact a sort of reservoir of land upon which any surplus population\r\ncould draw, and from which the more prosperous of the customary tenants\r\ncould lease additions to their holdings in the manner described above.\r\nIn our period the tendency is reversed. A lord is anxious to get rid of\r\nthe obstruction which the small farmer's lease offers to the\r\nconsolidation of holdings. He wishes to follow the advice of experts and\r\n\"reduce his demeans into one entier ferme.\"[501] Titles are questioned,\r\nand the small lessee, whose interest is a terminable one and unprotected\r\nby any manorial custom, is the first to suffer.\r\n\r\n    [499] Fitzherbert, _Book of Surveying_, p. 32.\r\n\r\n    [500] For reference, see p. 130, note 2.\r\n\r\n    [501] _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i., survey of Mudford\r\n    and Hinton.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) _The Copyholders_[502]\r\n\r\nBut were the tenants at will and the leaseholders the only classes to be\r\nevicted? No allusion has yet been made to the most difficult problem\r\nwhich confronts the student of the sixteenth century agrarian\r\nchanges--the degree of protection enjoyed by the copyholders. If this\r\nproblem is the most difficult it is also one of the most important. As\r\nfar as can be calculated, the copyholders far exceeded in number upon\r\nmost manors all other classes of tenants together. Copyhold tenure was\r\nthe rule, and tenure at will and leasehold were generally the exception,\r\nthough the latter was an important exception. If all copyholders had\r\ncomplete security, and were readily protected in their holdings by the\r\ncourts, there would be little sense in talking of an agrarian\r\nrevolution; for the changes, though they might still have caused much\r\nindividual suffering, could hardly have constituted anything like the\r\nserious national danger which they were thought to be by many\r\ncontemporaries. Again, the copyholders were in a special sense the\r\nkernel of a manor, the representatives of an ancient social system,\r\naround which the newer relationships of leasehold were, so to speak,\r\ncomparatively modern accretions. It was with them and their business\r\nthat the manorial courts were concerned; a copyhold tenement could not\r\nexist apart from a manor because surrender and admission in the manorial\r\ncourt was essential to its recognition as copyhold; and the very name of\r\n\"customary tenants,\" by which copyholders were often described, suggests\r\nthe special antiquity and fixity of their position. Even in the\r\nsixteenth century there were still manors where there were no tenants at\r\nall except copyholders, and the mere shedding of the outer layers of\r\nsmall leaseholders, who had sprung up around them, would have left the\r\norganisation of such manors quite intact. It would have cut back recent\r\ndevelopments; it would not have shaken rural society very seriously.\r\nOne's view of the importance of the agrarian changes of the sixteenth\r\ncentury will depend, therefore, to a great extent, upon the opinion\r\nwhich is formed of the legal position of the copyholders.\r\n\r\n    [502] In the following section on copyholders I have been guided\r\n    largely by Dr. Savine's article in the _Quarterly Journal of\r\n    Economics_, vol. xix.\r\n\r\nThe problem centres in the question to what extent a copyholder who was\r\nthreatened with eviction could obtain protection from the courts. It is\r\nnot at all easy to extract a definite answer on this point from the\r\nwriters of the period, whose views as to the degree of security enjoyed\r\nby copyhold are often inconsistent with each other, and sometimes seem\r\nto be inconsistent with themselves. The layman certainly thought that\r\ncopyhold tenants could be and were evicted, and this view seems to be\r\nsupported by Fitzherbert.[503] It is true that he draws a sharp\r\ndistinction between the customary land, the rent of which cannot be\r\naltered, and the new intakes from the waste or the demesne, the rent of\r\nwhich can be forced up at the lord's pleasure. But he expressly states\r\nthat copyhold tenants cannot get protection from the courts: \"These\r\nmanners of tennants shall not plede nor be impleded of their tenements\r\nby the king's writte\"; and he implies elsewhere that the lord can\r\nincrease both rent and fines. Kitchin,[504] on the other hand, thinks\r\nthat the lord can never increase the amount of the admission fine; while\r\nCoke,[505] in a well-known passage, emphasises the copyholder's security\r\nas long as he makes no breach in the custom by failing in his services,\r\nand points out that he can protect himself either by proceedings in\r\nChancery or by a writ of trespass.\r\n\r\n    [503] Fitzherbert, _Book of Surveying_, p. 28.\r\n\r\n    [504] Kitchin, _Court Leet_.\r\n\r\n    [505] Coke, _The Complete Copyholder_.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, in view of the variety of opinion as to the\r\ncopyholders' status which obtained in the sixteenth century, that there\r\nshould have been much disagreement about it among historians. It seems\r\npossible, however, at any rate to narrow the limits of conjecture by\r\nruling certain theories out of account. In the first place one can\r\nhardly now accept the view put forward by Mr. Leadam,[506] that, at any\r\nrate after 1467, all copyholders had complete legal security, as\r\ncomplete, it would appear, as freehold, though guaranteed by different\r\nremedies. He holds that copyholders who occupied customary land, and who\r\nwere \"tenants at will according to the custom of the manor,\" could get\r\nredress either by petition in the Court of the lord with an appeal to\r\nChancery, or by an action of trespass in the Common Pleas, the classes\r\nwho suffered from eviction being \"tenants at will at Common Law,\" who,\r\nthough sometimes described as inferior copyholders, were not really\r\ncopyholders at all, because they did not occupy the lands set apart as\r\ncustomary lands. This view, according to which the lord could clear off\r\nhis estate all the newer copyhold tenancies on the demesne or waste, but\r\nwas debarred by the courts from touching the tenancies on the customary\r\nland of the manor, receives a certain support from the great pains\r\nshown by the manorial authorities in distinguishing between the two.\r\nBut, while it rightly emphasises the special features of the tenure of\r\ncustomary land, it is difficult to reconcile what we actually know of\r\nthe position of copyholders with this theory as to the complete security\r\nof copyhold tenure. To the objection that contemporaries who could\r\nhardly have been mistaken certainly supposed that copyholders suffered,\r\nMr. Leadam would, no doubt, answer that they were thinking of the\r\n\"inferior copyholders\" who held pieces of the demesne or waste. But this\r\nanswer has got to meet difficulties which are really overwhelming. On\r\nthe one hand, the historical confirmation which Mr. Leadam seeks, by\r\ntrying to trace the distinction postulated back into the remote regions\r\nof tenure in villeinage, can no longer be accepted now that the\r\ndifference between villeinage \"regardant\" and villeinage \"en gros,\" on\r\nwhich he relies, has been proved to refer not to differences in the\r\ntenure by which the serfs held their lands, but simply to different\r\nmethods of pleading, which have nothing to do with the question of the\r\ntenant's security, but merely with the form in which cases were argued\r\nin the courts.[507] On the other hand, it cannot be made to fit the\r\nfacts of the copyholders' position in the sixteenth century. The truth\r\nis that copyholders were not safe even on the sacred customary land\r\nitself. It is quite certain that a great many copyholds were not\r\ncopyholds of inheritance, but copyholds for life, which returned into\r\nthe hands of the lord with the death of every tenant. It is certain\r\nalso, as will be shown later, that fines for admission to customary\r\nholdings were on some manors raised enormously during the sixteenth\r\ncentury. How can one reconcile these facts with the view that the lord\r\ncould make no alteration in the treatment of the customary land which\r\nwould jeopardise the copyholders' interest?\r\n\r\n    [506] Leadam, _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, New Series, vol. vi.\r\n\r\n    [507] Vinogradoff, _Villainage in England_, pp. 48-56.\r\n\r\nNor is it easy to accept the sharply contrasted theory of Professor\r\nAshley.[508] Where Mr. Leadam sees absolute security of tenure\r\nguaranteed by the courts, Professor Ashley sees absolute insecurity\r\nmitigated by a once powerful but now decaying custom. In the past, when\r\nthe lord's land had been dependent on labour services for its\r\ncultivation, the last thing he wanted to do was to get rid of the\r\ntenants, and therefore custom had made it a rule of practice, though not\r\nof law, that first villein, and then copyhold, tenements should pass in\r\nthe manorial court from father to son. But just when this custom was on\r\nthe way to become law through the action of the courts in extending\r\nprotection to copyholders, changed economic conditions made pasture\r\nfarming much more profitable than tillage, and so supplied landowners\r\nwith a strong motive for breaking it down. In the struggle which\r\nfollowed custom and public opinion were on the side of the tenants, but\r\nthe law was on the side of the landlords, and copyholders were evicted\r\nwithout being able to obtain any legal redress, not merely through\r\nignorance or intimidation, but because no legal protection was offered\r\nthem by the courts. There is perhaps only one serious objection to this\r\ningenious theory. But that is insuperable. It is that in certain\r\ncircumstances, at any rate, the courts did in fact offer protection to\r\ncopyholders who were threatened with eviction. In the fifteenth century\r\na considerable number of cases came before the Court of Chancery. In the\r\nsixteenth century the same business, which in view of the number of\r\ncopyholders must have been a lucrative one, came before the Common Law\r\nCourts. The case of the year 1482,[509] which is quoted by Professor\r\nAshley to show the hesitation which the judges felt as to whether a\r\ncopyholder had any legal remedy, is really one of a long series in which\r\nthe courts considered the claims of copyholders, and which Coke must\r\nhave had in mind when he said, \"Now copyholders stand upon a sure\r\nground: now they weigh not their lord's displeasure, they shake not at\r\nevery sudden blast of wind, they eat, drink, sleep securely ... let the\r\nlord frown, the copyholder cares not, knowing himself safe, and not\r\nwithin any danger.\"[510] To overlook that series of cases is really to\r\nmisread a change of the first importance, a change which almost amounted\r\nto a legal revolution. Suppose that at the present day the courts were\r\nto begin to protect the \"tenant right\" of workmen who have given their\r\nlives to a trade by ruling that any man dismissed after fifteen years\r\ncontinuous service should either be reinstated or receive compensation?\r\nThe change would be greater--but would it be much greater?--than the\r\nmomentous departure that was made by the judges who for the first time\r\ndecided that a man impleaded for a villein tenement should have an\r\naction in Chancery. For centuries such actions could not be brought, and\r\nif brought would have been simply sent back to the court of the manor\r\nwith the endorsement \"our lord the king does not interfere in matters of\r\nvilleinage.\"[511] Now the tide is reversed. From 1439 onwards a stream\r\nof equitable jurisdiction flows out from the Chancery to secure the\r\ntitle of the very class which has hitherto had no legal title at all.\r\nTenure in villeinage becomes copyhold. Clearly the discovery of these\r\ncases by Dr. Savine[512] must alter the whole standpoint from which we\r\nview the struggle between lords and copyholders in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. If one must reject the view of Mr. Leadam that copyholders on\r\ncustomary land had complete legal security, one must also, it would\r\nseem, reject the view of Professor Ashley that the courts never\r\ninterfered in their favour. Somehow or another one must reconcile a good\r\ndeal of insecurity with a good deal of protection, the complaints of\r\ncontemporaries that copyholders suffered from enclosures with the\r\nequally indisputable fact that they were fairly often protected by the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n    [508] Ashley, _Economic History_, Part I., vol. ii. pp. 274-282.\r\n\r\n    [509] Coke upon Littleton, 60 b.\r\n\r\n    [510] Coke, _The Complete Copyholder_.\r\n\r\n    [511] Note-book of Bracton pl., 1237: \"Dominus rex non vult se\r\n    de eis intromittere\" (quoted Vinogradoff, _Villainage in\r\n    England_, p. 46, note 2).\r\n\r\n    [512] On this point see _English Hist. Review_, vol. viii. p.\r\n    296.\r\n\r\nA way leading some distance through this apparent contradiction may,\r\nperhaps, be found by recurring to that dependence upon manorial custom\r\nwhich is the characteristic feature of copyhold. A copyholder is a\r\ntenant by copy of Court Roll according to the custom of the manor, and\r\nthis custom is primarily what regulates his rights and obligations. The\r\ncustom must be an immemorial one; mere prescription is not custom; to be\r\nbinding it must have \"been used time out of mind.\" Given such a custom,\r\nit is this upon which the nature of the copyholder's tenure depends; and\r\nit is noticeable that authorities who differ as to the practical outcome\r\nof it, all agree that it is with custom that the first appeal lies. But\r\nthe custom of a manor is a particular and individual thing peculiar to\r\nthat manor, and determining the relations between lord and tenant there\r\nand not elsewhere. In the words of a surveyor, \"Their customs are not so\r\nuniversall as if a man have experyence of the customs and services of\r\nany mannor he shall thereby have perfect knowledge of all the rest, or\r\nif he be experte of the customes of any one mannor in any one countie\r\nthat he shall nede no further enstruccions for all the residewe of the\r\nmannors within that countie.\"[513] There are several different sets of\r\ncustoms, and therefore several different sorts of copyhold. There are,\r\nin fact, copyholders and copyholders, and there is no general law of\r\ncopyhold because its essence is to be local and peculiar. The first\r\nquestion, therefore, which has got to be asked, when considering the\r\nquestion of the legal security of copyholders, relates to the custom of\r\nthe manor on which they are found; for probably, if the parties go to\r\nlaw, this is the first question which will be asked by the court. If it\r\nis shown that in getting rid of a tenant the lord has broken the custom\r\nof the manor, there is much likelihood in the sixteenth century that the\r\ncourt will restore it. If this is not shown, there is little probability\r\nthat the court will go behind the custom in favour of the tenants, or\r\ntry to harmonise it with general principles of equity, except in so far\r\nas it declines to take account of customs which are held to be\r\n\"unreasonable,\" a word too vague to be much protection to a tenant or\r\nmuch hindrance to a lord. It is this tremendous importance of local\r\ncustom which causes it to be so minutely entered in manorial documents,\r\nand which results both in the constant appeals which are made to it when\r\ncases come before the courts, and in the careful recording of\r\ncontradictory opinions. Surveyors are at pains to emphasise the\r\ndifference between land which is customary land and land which is not,\r\nbecause, while on the former the introduction of new conditions will be\r\nfollowed by all sorts of friction and disturbance, on the latter the\r\ntenants will have no case in opposing them. It is here that Mr. Leadam's\r\ndistinction between holders of customary land and holders of land taken\r\nfrom the waste or the demesne becomes of real value. It is a particular\r\nexemplification of a general rule, the rule that the appeal is always to\r\ncustom. The meaning of the distinction is not, as Mr. Leadam seems to\r\nsuggest, that copyholders on the former always had legal protection and\r\ncopyholders on the latter always had not. It is that the crucial\r\nquestion is always, \"What sort of custom are you under?\" and that, while\r\non the customary holdings the custom _may_ be unfavourable to the\r\ntenant's security, it is much more likely to be unfavourable on the\r\nnewer tenancies formed on land which, perhaps within the memory of\r\npersons living, was indubitably the lord's own, not merely in the\r\ngeneral sense in which even the villein's land had been the lord's, but\r\nin the practical sense that it was part of his demesne to use as he\r\npleased. In fact quite a common answer when copyholders bring an action\r\nis the statement that the land in question is not ancient copyhold but\r\npart of the demesne;[514] and when the Protector Somerset applied his\r\npopular agrarian policy to his own estates he had to get Parliament to\r\npass a special Act to give the copyholders on his demesnes peculiar\r\nsecurity.[515]\r\n\r\n    [513] _Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i.

Denies that \"the premises\r\n    have been used to be dymytted or be dymittable by copie of Court\r\n    Roll for term of lyfe or lyves as in fee\"; on the contrary \"yt\r\n    may appear that the same have been letten by term of yeres.\"\r\n\r\n    [515] In 1548 an Act was passed \"for the assurance to the\r\n    tenants of graunts and leases made for the Duke of Somerset's\r\n    demesne lands.\" It begins, \"Whereas of truth noe custom or usage\r\n    can or maye by the lawes of this realm be annexed or knytt to\r\n    any meases, lands, tenements, or hereditaments letten by copye\r\n    of Court Roll ... albeyt those words 'secundum consuetudinem\r\n    manerii,' be rehearsed and expressed in the saide Court Rolle or\r\n    coppie had or made, except that the same meases, lands,\r\n    tenements, or other hereditaments, so letten be of olde\r\n    customarie or coppieholde land, and have byn used by all the\r\n    tyme whereof memory of man is not to the contrary to be letten\r\n    or demysed by copie of court roll.\"\r\n\r\nThe significance of custom is shown in other ways as well. In the\r\nnumerous petitions in Chancery addressed by copyholders their demand is\r\nconstantly for a recital or confirmation of manorial customs, and the\r\nsame line is taken in the fewer cases which come before the Courts of\r\nCommon Law. Tenants who claim an estate of inheritance and a fixed fine\r\non admission refuse in a body to show their copies to the surveyors,\r\npresumably for fear that, if they do, some excuse may be made to upset\r\nthe custom.[516] Tenants will perjure themselves as to the nature of the\r\ncustom of their manor in order to be thought to have estates of\r\ninheritance. In the days when copyholders (if they exist at all) are\r\nstill very few and villeins many, men who are really villeins of St.\r\nPeter's of Exeter come forward and swear falsely that they hold in\r\nsocage, \"intending all to say that they hold and ought to hold _de\r\nstipite in stipitem_, Anglice stock after stock\";[517] but the falsehood\r\nis exposed, and they are punished with a fine of 30s. The copyhold\r\ntenants on the Northumbrian manor of Amble claim in the sixteenth\r\ncentury that manorial custom requires that the next of kin of the whole\r\nblood shall succeed his father, and that the fines shall be limited to\r\ntwo years' rent. But the surveyors repudiate their claim, remarking that\r\n\"we cannot find that they have any such estate of inheritance.\"[518]\r\nElsewhere the copyholders are more fortunate, and succeed in inducing\r\nthe manorial authorities themselves to make formal admission of the\r\ncustom, or in proving its existence to the satisfaction of the courts.\r\nIn 1567 the Dean and Chapter of Winchester Cathedral, and the one\r\nhundred and fifty-eight copyhold tenants on their manor of Crondal,\r\nenter into a solemn covenant and bargain--may we not call it a\r\n\"collective bargain\"?--whereby it is agreed that fixed rents, fixed\r\nfines, and copyholds of inheritance, \"shall be from henceforth for ever\r\naccepted, reputed, deamed, and taken to be vearye trewe, just, certaine,\r\nand auncient customs, rights, dewtyes, and useages, between the Lorde\r\nand the Customarye tenants ...; and shall from henceforth stand,\r\ncontynewe, remayne, and be of perfect force and strength to conclude and\r\nbynde the said Deane and Chapiter, their successors and assignees of the\r\nsaid mannour and hundred and everye parte thereof for ever.\"[519] The\r\ntenants at Elswick[520] go to law with the lord of the manor on the\r\nquestion of the nature of their estates, and, on the records of a custom\r\nrequiring the admission of a son on his father's death being produced,\r\nthe custom is confirmed by the court. Even the Government of Elizabeth,\r\nfavourable as it was to the small man, would not intervene without first\r\nbeing informed of the nature of the custom. When a tenant appeals to\r\nthem for protection, they refer the matter to the local justices, with a\r\nrequest to \"certifie their opinions of the poor man's right.\"[521] No\r\ndoubt once the Courts begin to interfere with the internal business of a\r\nmanor they tend to break down some of the peculiarities of local custom,\r\nand to set up a general pattern of copyhold tenure by ruling out certain\r\ncustoms as \"unreasonable.\" Copyholders for life may not cut down\r\ntimber,[522] though perhaps copyholders of inheritance may. Two and a\r\nhalf years' rent is held by the reign of Charles I. to be an\r\nunreasonable fine, one and a half years' to be reasonable, and the heir\r\nshall not forfeit his copyhold if he tenders such a sum when he demands\r\nadmission.[523] But the definition of what is meant by \"unreasonable\"\r\nhas been going on from that day to this, and is perhaps not yet\r\ncompleted. In our period it was only just beginning. At any rate we\r\nshall not be far wrong if we say that, speaking broadly, the crucial\r\nquestion is always whether the custom makes it easy for lords to get rid\r\nof tenants or whether it makes it difficult. If an ancient custom gives\r\nthe lord a free hand, he has little trouble in getting his way. If it\r\nrestricts him, the courts are likely to enforce the restriction, and\r\nthough the lord still has, of course, the option of extra-legal action\r\nby way of persuasion, cajolery, or intimidation, the tenants are likely\r\nto be protected by the law.\r\n\r\n    [516] See pp. 122-123.\r\n\r\n    [517] _Hist.

But peradventure there may\r\n    be such a custom for a copyholder of inheritance.\"\r\n\r\n    [523] _Ibid._, vol. iii., p. 198, case 8, Hill, 5 Car., Rot.\r\n    125: \"The question was whether a lord of a mannor may assess two\r\n    years and a half value of copyhold land according to racked rent\r\n    for a fine upon surrender and admittance, and for non-payment\r\n    enter for forfeiture. And all the Court conceived that one year\r\n    and a half of rent improved is high enough; and the defendant\r\n    assessing two years and a half it is unreasonable, and therefore\r\n    the plaintiff might well refuse the payment thereof.\" _Ibid._,\r\n    vol. i. p. 779, case 13, takes the rule that unreasonable fines\r\n    need not be paid back to 1600 (\"It was holden _per curiam_ that\r\n    if the lord demands an unreasonable fine of his coppyholder\r\n    where the fine is uncertain, if he denies it, it is not any\r\n    forfeiture of his copyhold\"), but his judgment does not say how\r\n    many years' rent is a reasonable fine. The _Calendar of Chancery\r\n    Proceedings, temp._ Eliz., is full of petitions from tenants\r\n    asking the court to declare fines excessive. The rule that a\r\n    fine must not exceed two years' rent does not appear to have\r\n    been accepted as binding till 1781 (_Grant v. Ashe, Douglas\r\n    Reports_, 722?-723). But it is plain from the cases cited above\r\n    that by 1600 it was recognised that some fines were\r\n    unreasonable, and by 1630 that a reasonable fine should not\r\n    exceed one and a half years' rent. The fact that the Chancery\r\n    intervened to protect the equitable interests of copyholders\r\n    earlier than the Common Law Courts leads one to suspect that\r\n    there must be earlier cases than these of the Courts declaring\r\n    fines unreasonable. But I have not found them.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of copyhold upon manorial custom offers an explanation of\r\nthe fact that the changes of the sixteenth century displaced\r\ncopyholders, although the courts would intervene when a custom which\r\ngave them security was proved to exist. The most important questions\r\nwith regard to the custom which determined the copyholders' position\r\nwere two: first, whether he had by it an estate of inheritance, or\r\nmerely an estate for years, for life, or for lives; second, whether his\r\npayments were fixed or unalterable, or whether they could be increased\r\nat the will of the lord. If it was not an estate of inheritance his\r\nholding returned fairly frequently into the hands of the manorial\r\nauthorities, who could either renew it on the old terms, or lease it at\r\nan increased rent, or amalgamate it with a large farm. In the second\r\ncase, where payments were variable, lords could force a tenant to throw\r\nup his land by placing a prohibitive burden upon it. The only way of\r\nascertaining with accuracy the real position of copyholders in our\r\nperiod would be to show the relative proportions in which these four\r\narrangements are found upon each of many hundred manors. And this we\r\ncannot yet do. The figures published by Dr. Savine[524] suggest that\r\nmanors on which copyholders possessed an estate of inheritance, and\r\nthose where they did not, were about equal in number, while manors on\r\nwhich the fines were uncertain predominated over those on which they\r\nwere fixed in a proportion of more than two to one. Since it would seem\r\nthat the ability of the lord to demand what fine he pleased could be\r\nused as a means of excluding a successor even when the copy was not\r\nmerely for life or lives but from father to son, his investigations\r\nsuggest that the copyholders' tenure was more often insecure than not.\r\n\r\n    [524] _Quarterly Journal of Economics_, vol. xix.\r\n\r\nTo the examples which he has collected one may perhaps add certain\r\nothers, inadequate though they are in point of quantity. Taking\r\ntwenty-one[525] manors in the years 1568?-1573, of which three are in\r\nSomersetshire, one in Devonshire, and seventeen in Wiltshire, one finds\r\nthat on only one out of the whole number was the copyholders' estate one\r\nof inheritance. On one manor copies were granted for four lives or\r\nless--it is expressly stated that they are not to be granted for\r\nmore--and on nineteen they are granted for three lives or less. On one\r\nmanor (that where the copyholders had estates of inheritance) the fine\r\nwas fixed by custom at a sum which is not stated, but which could not be\r\nincreased. On the remaining twenty the fine was a variable one, the\r\ngeneral formula being that land shall be given \"for such fines as buyers\r\ncan fix by bargaining with the lord or his officers, both in possession\r\nand in reversion,\" which means that they were to be fixed by the\r\nhiggling of the market. Turning next to two manors on the Welsh[526]\r\nBorder, which were in possession of the Crown, one is told that in the\r\nreign of Elizabeth the royal officers granted the tenants leases for\r\nyears, renewable at the will of the tenant, and fixed the fine at two\r\nyears' rent, thus giving them what was virtually an estate of\r\ninheritance. It is possible, however, that the Crown tenants received\r\nmore favourable treatment than did those on manors which were in\r\nprivate hands. From Northumberland, again, there is a good deal of\r\nevidence which it is difficult to summarise. Coke stated that \"the\r\ncustomary tenants upon the borders of Scotland ... are mere tenants at\r\nwill, and though they keep their customs inviolate, yet the lord might,\r\nsans controll, evict them.\"[527] At the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury an order in Chancery ruled that none of the tenants of Lady\r\nCumberland,[528] who paid a fine on the death of lord and tenant, could\r\nhave an estate of inheritance; and we have clear evidence that the fines\r\npaid by the copyhold tenants of the Earl of Northumberland[529]\r\nincreased very considerably in the course of the sixteenth century. On\r\nthe other hand such insecurity was not universal. A common rule on the\r\nNorthumbrian border seems to have given a copyhold for life, with a\r\ntenant right of renewal to the heir, provided that a constant custom of\r\nrenewal could be proved.[530] On the Crown estates in the reign of\r\nElizabeth fines were fixed on conditions which varied from place to\r\nplace; sometimes they were at discretion, sometimes one year's rent,\r\nsometimes two years' rent; and in 1609 the tenants of twelve\r\nTynemouthshire manors got the Courts to confirm a custom limiting their\r\nfine to a definite sum, on six of them to £2 on the admission of a\r\ndescendant, and £4 on alienation, and on the remaining six to one year's\r\nrent in the former case and two years' rent in the latter.[531] On\r\neleven out of thirteen manors in Norfolk[532] and Suffolk the fines are\r\nuncertain; on one, Wighton, they are said to have been fixed at 4s. per\r\nacre \"by the space of 100 years at least\"; on one, Aldeburgh, there is a\r\ncurious distinction between the fines paid for land \"in the fields,\"\r\nwhich are at the will of the lord, and the fines paid for cottage\r\ntenements, which are fixed at 2s. when the site is built upon and 1s.\r\nwhen the site is not covered. Elsewhere when the fine is fixed the\r\nordinary payment seems to be usually two years' rent on descent, with\r\nsometimes a small addition, sometimes a small deduction, when the\r\ntenement is alienated during the tenant's life. Estates of inheritance\r\nand fixed fines do not necessarily go together. The general situation on\r\nthe small number of manors for which information has been obtained is\r\nset out below.[533] Table I relates to duration of tenancies, Table II\r\nto the character of admission fines. In each table, line (_a_) gives Dr.\r\nSavine's figures, line (_b_) our own, line (_c_) the total of both\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n  TABLE XIII\r\n\r\n  I\r\n\r\n  DURATION OF TENURE\r\n\r\n  +---------+------------+----------------+--------------+----------------+\r\n  |         |            |Copyholds for   |              | Copyholds for  |\r\n  |         |            | Years but with |              |Years but with- |\r\n  | Manors. |Copyholds of|Right of Renewal|Copyholds for | out Right of   |\r\n  |         |Inheritance.| (_i.e._        |Life or Lives.| Renewal(_i.e._ |\r\n  |         |            |  virtually     |   Renewal    |virtually Leases|\r\n  |         |            |  Copyholds of  |              |  for Years).   |\r\n  |         |            |  Inheritance). |              |                |\r\n  +---------+------------+----------------+--------------+----------------+\r\n  |(_a_)  82|     25     |       17       |      40      |      ...       |\r\n  |(_b_)  60|     22     |        2       |      33      |       3        |\r\n  |(_c_) 142|     47     |       19       |      73      |       3        |\r\n  +---------+------------+----------------+--------------+----------------+\r\n\r\n  II\r\n\r\n  CHARACTER OF FINES\r\n\r\n  +---------+------------------+--------------------+---------------------+\r\n  |         |                  |                    |  Partly Certain and |\r\n  | Manors. |   Fines Certain. |  Fines Uncertain.  |  Partly Uncertain.  |\r\n  +---------+------------------+--------------------+---------------------+\r\n  |(_a_)  86|        28        |         58         |         ...         |\r\n  |(_b_)  61|        25        |         35         |          1          |\r\n  |(_c_) 147|        53        |         93         |          1          |\r\n  +---------+------------------+--------------------+---------------------+\r\n\r\n    [525] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Pembroke Manors_.

When the copyhold is one of inheritance, it is\r\nlegally complete, unless the tenants incur forfeiture by breaking the\r\ncustom. An estate for life with right of renewal is virtually as good as\r\na copyhold of inheritance. Estates for life or lives are precarious.\r\nCopyholds for years without right of renewal are scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from leases. On the whole, when these examples are added\r\nto those of Dr. Savine, it would appear that copyholds for life or lives\r\nwere more usual than copyholds of inheritance, while fixed fines were\r\nthe exception and variable fines the general rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) _The Undermining of Customary Tenures_\r\n\r\nThe importance of the predominance of copyholds for lives for the\r\nquestion of the degree of security enjoyed by the tenant is shown by the\r\nefforts which were made by lords of manors, where copyholders had\r\nestates of inheritance, to persuade them to give up their copies and\r\ntake leases instead. It is evident that in this course they encountered\r\na good deal of opposition. On manors, however, where the copyholds\r\nescheated to the lord at intervals of one, two, or three lives, he could\r\nsubstitute leases for a regrant of the copies, or throw the holdings\r\ninto a large farm, or retain them in his own hands. Though such action\r\nmight be thought harsh, it could hardly be prevented by the tenants,\r\nsince the lord could always hold the threat of eviction over their\r\nheads. One finds some manors where the striking and exceptional\r\npreponderance of small leaseholders suggests unmistakably that such a\r\nconversion of copyhold to leasehold has taken place,[534] or where the\r\nmotive of the alteration is shown by the great rise in rents which has\r\nfollowed it. One finds others where the struggle between copyhold and\r\nleasehold is going on and is still undecided. In that struggle the\r\nchances are against the copyholders, even though their interest is\r\nprotected by the law, for the law is less powerful than ignorance and\r\nfear. How can our peasants, men \"very simple and ignorant of their\r\nestates,\"[535] enter into the respective merits of copies and leases\r\nwith the powers of the manor, armed with professional advice and all\r\nthose indefinite but invincible advantages in bargaining which are given\r\nby legal knowledge, social influence, and a long tradition of authority?\r\nIt is so easy to get caught in some legal trap. In the reign of Charles\r\nI., the two hundred Crown tenants of the manor of North Wheatley, who\r\nhave suffered much in the way of rack-renting from the officers of their\r\nimpecunious lord, engage a lawyer to negotiate the renewal of their\r\nleases of the demesne lands. The grant is made to him, as their\r\nattorney; but, to their dismay, they find that he declines to fulfil his\r\nbargain. He has \"afterward, contrary to the Trust committed to him,\r\nincreased and raised the rent thereof upon the tenants, to his owne\r\nprivat benefitt.\"[536] The tenants of Hewlington succeed, as we have\r\nseen, in inducing the Crown to recognise their estates of inheritance by\r\ngranting that their forty years' leases shall be renewable at the will\r\nof the tenants. Then unexpectedly a servant of the Earl of Leicester\r\npurchases one of the townships. The tenants, in an agony of\r\napprehension, \"perceiving that they were like to have their said landes\r\nand tenements after the expiration of their said leases taken from them,\r\nand that they had no remedy by the course of the common law to helpe\r\nthemselves, preferred their Bill to be relieved in Equitie.\" Chancery\r\ncomes to their rescue. It decides that the covenant made by the Crown to\r\nthe effect that their leases should be renewable at the option of the\r\nholder is binding not only on the Crown, but on all to whom it might\r\nsell the lands in question. But their troubles are not yet finished. It\r\nis one thing to get a judgment, another for the judgment to be carried\r\nout. The purchaser is servant to a great man and can afford to be\r\ndilatory and recalcitrant. We leave these villagers still petitioning\r\n\"His Highness and His Honourable Council and Commissioners of Revenue\r\nthat when it shall seem good unto them the said tenants may be admitted\r\nto have their leases accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n    [534] _E.g._ Ormesby in Norfolk, where in 1516 thirty-one\r\n    tenants holding \"in farm\" formed the whole landholding\r\n    population (R.O. Rentals and Surveys, Gen. Ser., Portf. 22, No.\r\n    18). For a great rise in rents following a probable substitution\r\n    of leases for customary tenures, see the case of Lewisham in\r\n    Kent. On this manor in the reign of Henry VI. the rent of the\r\n    tenants (tenure unspecified) was £8, 11s. 7d., 9 plougshares,\r\n    and 6s. 2-1/2d. in the abbot's hand (R.O. Rentals and Surveys,\r\n    Gen. Ser., Roll 361). In 1621 it was £23, 1s. 6-1/2d. (R.O.\r\n    _Misc. Bks. Treas. of Receipt_, vol. clxxiv., fol. 1?34). In the\r\n    reign of James I. we have full details. The rent of the free\r\n    tenants was £17, 12s. 10-1/2d.; that of the tenants at will 9d.;\r\n    that of tenants \"per dimissionem\" (_i.e._ lease-holders) £72,\r\n    9s. 8-1/2d. (R.O. _Misc. Bks. Aug. Off._, vol. ccccxiv., f.\r\n    33?34). It is unfortunate that we are not told how the bulk of\r\n    the tenants held at the two earlier dates. But is it\r\n    unreasonable to say that they were probably customary tenants,\r\n    and that the introduction of leases was followed by a great rise\r\n    in rents?\r\n\r\n    [535] Survey of Town and Liberty of Holt, MS. transcript in\r\n    Wrexham Free Library.\r\n\r\n    [536] _S. P. D._, ch. i. vol. cli., No. 38. (See Appendix I.,\r\n    No. iv.)\r\n\r\nIt is so easy to be intimidated by the fear of aggravating your\r\nmisfortunes. When an agent frightens some tenants by telling them the\r\nunfavourable decision of the Court of Chancery as to the tenant right of\r\nthe copyholders on a neighbouring estate, do they answer, as they\r\nshould, that manorial customs vary, and that they will see what the\r\nCourts say about their own? No, they make \"Humble suit that your\r\nlordship will be pleased to grant them leases for twenty-one years, and\r\nthey will pay, in lieu of their fine, double rent for every farm.\"[537]\r\nSometimes they live to repent their bargain. \"I have persuaded one John\r\nWilson of Over-Buston,\" writes a manorial official to the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, \"to deliver me in his copy, and he is content to take a\r\nlease at double rent.\"[538] A strange chance has left us a letter, in\r\nwhich this very John Wilson, labouring horribly amid the intricacies of\r\ngrammar, expounds through one long, broken-backed sentence, what balm\r\nsuch \"contentment\" brings. \"To the Right Honourable the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, the humble petition of John Wilson, his wife and 8 poor\r\nchildren. Humbly complaining showeth ... your petitioner ... that\r\nwhereas your said petitioner and his predecessors being ancient tenants\r\nto your honour, holding one tenement on ferme in Upper Bustone, by\r\nvirtue of copyhold tenure out of the memory of man, which copies both of\r\nyour said poor petitioners' great grandfather, his father's father, and\r\nhis own father are yet extant to be seen: and now of late your said\r\npoor petitioner, being under age, helpless and none to do for him, and\r\nforced (God knows) by some of your honour's officers to take a lease and\r\npay double and treble rent, in so much that your said poor petitioner,\r\nhis wife, and 8 poor children is utterly now beggared and overthrown,\r\nunless your worthy good honour will be pleased to take a pitiful\r\ncommunication thereof, or otherwise your saide poore petitioner, his\r\nwife and poore children knows no other way but of force to give over\r\nyour honour's land, by reason of the deare renting thereof, and so be\r\nconstrained to go a-begging up and down the countrie.\"[539] Poor,\r\npatient, stiff-fingered John Wilson, so certain that he has not been\r\ntreated fairly, so confident that his lordship cannot have meant him to\r\nbe wronged, so easily circumvented by his lordship's brisk officials! He\r\nand his heavy kind are slow to move; but, once roused, they will not\r\neasily be persuaded to go back. It was such as he that, at one time or\r\nanother in the sixteenth century, set half the English counties ablaze\r\nwith the grievances of the tillers of the soil.\r\n\r\n    [537] _Northumberland County History_, vol. viii. p. 238.\r\n\r\n    [538] _Ibid._, vol. v. p. 211. The rent was raised from 18s. to\r\n    36s.\r\n\r\n    [539] _Northumberland County History_, vol. v. p. 210.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the predominance of variable fines is very evident\r\nif one turns to examine the economic relations between lords and\r\ncopyhold tenants as they stood in the middle of the sixteenth century. A\r\nmanor on which there was a large number of customary tenants must have\r\noften seemed from the point of the owner a rather disappointing form of\r\nproperty, because the first fruits of economic progress tended to pass\r\ninto the hands of the tenants. The rents and services due from their\r\nholdings were fixed by custom; meanwhile prices were rising with the\r\nfall in the value of silver, and the result, as is pointed out by\r\nMaitland, was that the economic rent or unearned increment of their\r\nproperties was intercepted by the copyholders, instead of being drained,\r\nas under leasehold, into the pocket of the lord.\r\n\r\nAn explanation of what is meant can best be given by recurring to the\r\ntable of rents printed in Chapter III. of Part I. It will be recollected\r\nthat on the manors there represented the value of the rents got by the\r\nlords from the customary tenants was often almost stationary. When the\r\nenormous fall in the purchasing power of money is remembered, it is\r\nclear that rentals must sometimes have very greatly depreciated, which\r\nof course meant that the tenants retained the surplus due to economic\r\nprogress, a surplus measured by the difference between the \"rents of\r\nassize\" and the full rack-rent for which the holding could be let if put\r\nup to competition, and amounting sometimes to more than three-quarters\r\nof the latter. At Wilburton, for example (to quote a fresh instance),\r\naccording to Maitland,[540] a virgate worth £7 or £8 only pays £1 in\r\nrent. From the competitive rents of the open market the lord was\r\ndebarred by the custom of the manor. How could he tap the surplus? He\r\ndid so, it may be suggested, either by inducing the tenants to exchange\r\ntheir copies for leases, or by raising the fines, when the fines were\r\nnot fixed by custom, so as to get in a lump sum what he could not get by\r\nyearly instalments. In that case the tenant's surplus was on paper only;\r\nhe was exactly in the position of an investor in a stock of inflated\r\nvalue, the high nominal interest of which has been capitalised in the\r\nprice paid for the shares. The probability that when fines were movable,\r\nthey were forced up in the sixteenth century so as to sweep away any\r\nunearned increment accruing to the holders of customary land, is not\r\nonly suggested by the bitter denunciations launched against the practice\r\nby contemporaries. It is also indicated by the manorial documents. May\r\nnot this be the explanation of what Maitland justly calls \"the absurdly\r\nhigh price\" of £1261 paid in the reign of James I. by the purchasers of\r\nWilburton, a manor the yearly value of which was at the time only £33?\r\nThe suggestion is confirmed, as far as a few manors are concerned, by\r\nthe upward movement of fines revealed by the following table--\r\n\r\n    FINES PAID ON THREE MANORS IN NORTHUMBERLAND[541]\r\n\r\n                              1567.                            1585.\r\n   Acklington   £57, 3s. 8d. or £3, 3s. 4d.   £87, 10s. 0d. or £4, 17s. 2d.\r\n                  per tenant.                   per tenant.\r\n   High Buston  £11, 14s. 0d. or £2, 18s. 6d. £18,  0s. 0d. or £4, 10s. 0d.\r\n                  per tenant.                   per tenant.\r\n   Birling      £43, 7s. 6d. or £4, 6s. 9d.   £72,  0s. 0d. or £7,  4s. 0d.\r\n                  per tenant.                   per tenant.\r\n\r\n   FINES PER ACRE PAID ON SIX MANORS[542] IN WILTS AND ONE\r\n   IN SOMERSET\r\n\r\n\r\n   1520-39, average fine per acre for each of 42 tenants  1s.  3d.\r\n   1540-49,      \"          \"          \"      28    \"     2s. 11d.\r\n   1550-59,      \"          \"          \"      36    \"     5s.  6d.\r\n   1560-69,      \"          \"          \"      29    \"    11s.  0d.\r\n\r\n    [540] Maitland, _English Historical Review_, vol, ix., \"The\r\n    History of a Cambridgeshire Manor.\"\r\n\r\n    [541] _Northumberland County History_, vol. v.\r\n\r\n    [542] Roxburghe Club, _Surveys of Pembroke Manors_. The manors\r\n    are South Newton, Washerne, Donnington, Winterbourne Basset,\r\n    Estoverton and Phipheld, Byshopeston (all Wilts), and South\r\n    Brent and Huish (Somerset).\r\n\r\nThe figures show a steady upward movement during the third and fourth\r\ndecades of the century of a little over 100 per cent., a rather less\r\nrapid rise between 1549 and 1559, and another rise of 100 per cent.\r\nbetween 1559 and 1569. They are of course too small to be the basis of a\r\nwide generalisation, but perhaps they may be held to offer some\r\ndocumentary confirmation of a grievance which bulks large in the\r\nliterature of the period. The elasticity of fines at any rate corrects\r\nthe impression which would be formed of the tenants' position from\r\nlooking only at the comparatively stationary rents. The same tendency is\r\nsuggested by the details of individual copies. It was a not uncommon\r\npractice for a tenant who was in possession and had an estate for life\r\nto buy at a later date the right of his heir to succeed him. When this\r\nwas done we have an opportunity of comparing the fines paid at different\r\nperiods, and the complaints of contemporaries about unreasonable and\r\nexcessive fines become intelligible. This may be illustrated by a few\r\nextreme instances taken from the manors of Estoverton and Donnington in\r\nWiltshire, and of South Brent in Somersetshire.\r\n\r\n     Fine for Copy.    Fine for Reversion.\r\n\r\n     1.  6/8 (1537)    £5           (1563)\r\n     2. 40/?    \"       £13, 6s. 8d.

(1558)\r\n    14. £9   (1532)    £12          (1557)\r\n\r\nThough these are extreme cases, a considerable rise is the rule and not\r\nthe exception. The advantage of the fixed rent is in fact neutralised\r\nby the movable fine. Such figures give point to Crowley's outbursts,\r\n\"They take our houses over our heads; they buye our groundes out of\r\nhandes, they reyse our rents, they levy great, yea unreasonable\r\nfines.\"[543] It is not surprising that the programme[544] of agrarian\r\nreform put forward by the Yorkshire insurgents in 1536, and by the\r\nrebels under Ket in 1549, should have contained a demand for copyhold\r\nlands \"to be charged with an easy fine, as a capon or a reasonable sum\r\nof money.\" It is not surprising that the Court of Chancery[545] should\r\nhave been bombarded with petitions to declare or enforce customs\r\nlimiting the demands which a lord might make of an incoming tenant. It\r\nis perhaps more surprising that, in those cases where the fine was by\r\ncustom uncertain, the rule that a reasonable fine was about two years'\r\nrent should not have been enforced by judges at an earlier date and more\r\ngenerally than it seems to have been. For in the sixteenth century,\r\nthough many old economic ideas are going by the board, public opinion\r\nstill clings to the conception that there is a standard of fairness in\r\neconomic dealings which exists independently of the impersonal movements\r\nof the market, which honest men can discover, if they please, and which\r\nit is a matter of conscience for public authorities to enforce. Even a\r\ngood Protestant who hates the Pope will admit that there is more than a\r\nlittle in the Canon Law prohibition of usury,[546] and under usury, be\r\nit noted, the plain man includes rack-rents, as well as interest on\r\ncapital and exorbitant prices. If to a modern economist the demand for\r\nreasonable fines and rents savours of sentimentality and confusion, he\r\nmust logically condemn not only the peasants and their champions, but\r\nthe statesmen; not only Ket and Hales and More and Latimer, but almost\r\nevery member of every Elizabethan Privy Council. After all, all the\r\nprecedents are on the side of an attempt to enforce a standard which\r\nshall be independent of the result which might be reached by higgling\r\nbetween this landlord and that tenant. Prices are fixed, wages are\r\nfixed, the rate of interest is fixed, though the money market is\r\nbecoming more and more elusive, more and more critical of old-fashioned\r\nattempts at interference; the fines which freeholders must pay on\r\nadmission have been fixed for centuries. Now that copyhold has got the\r\nprotection of the Courts, it is not unnatural that tenants should ask\r\nthe State to do with regard to the bargain most affecting them what it\r\nalready does for bargains of nearly every other kind. It is not\r\nunnatural that, even when the fine is not settled by custom at a\r\ndefinite sum, they should demand nevertheless that the Courts should\r\nsanction that establishment of a \"common rule,\" which is the ideal of\r\nthe economically weak in all ages.\r\n\r\n    [543] E. E. T. S., Crowley, _The Way to Wealth_.\r\n\r\n    [544] See below, pp. 334-337.\r\n\r\n    [545] _Calendar of Proceedings in Chancery in the Reign of\r\n    Edward VI._ Bills to establish a fine certain on admission and\r\n    alienation, to get protection against exorbitant fines, &c. are\r\n    common. For popular complaints see E. E. T. S., _A Supplication\r\n    of the Poore Commons_: \"These extortioners have so improved\r\n    theyr lands that they make of a xls. fyne xl. pounds,\" &c. For\r\n    an actual instance see the following case. The tenants of\r\n    Austenfield claim \"that of ancient time all the customary\r\n    tenants of the said manor of Austenfield were finable at fines\r\n    certain, until of late years the lords moved by covetousness, by\r\n    troubling and vexing their copyholders, drove many of them, for\r\n    the buying of their quietness, to be at fines uncertain\"\r\n    (William Salt Collection, vol. ix. Chancery Proceedings. Bdle.\r\n    12, No. 70).\r\n\r\n    [546] Th. Wilson, _A Discourse upon Usurie_, 1584: \"And\r\n    therefore I would not have men altogether to be enemies to the\r\n    Canon Lawe, and to condemn everything there written, because the\r\n    Pope was author of them.... Naie, I will saie plainlie that\r\n    there be some such lawes made by the Pope as be right godlie,\r\n    saie others what they list.\"\r\n\r\nYet we shall miss the full significance of the movement which we have\r\nexamined, if we take their demands without analysis, and do not look at\r\nthe other side of the picture. There was much to be said on the side of\r\nthe manorial authorities, harsh as they often were. The criticism which\r\nNorden,[547] with a surveyor's experience, makes upon the outcry against\r\nthe upward movement of fines, by pointing out that the whole scale of\r\nprices and payments has been shifted by the depreciation in the value of\r\nmoney, is perfectly justified. For money had depreciated, depreciated\r\nenormously; and landlords, who were faced with swiftly rising prices on\r\nthe one hand and fixed freehold and copyhold rents on the other, were in\r\na cleft stick from which it is not easy to blame them for extricating\r\nthemselves as best they could. The truth is that if we content ourselves\r\nwith the supposition of an access of exceptional unscrupulousness on the\r\npart of lords of manors which was favoured by contemporaries, we shall\r\nmisread the situation. The real facts were much more complex, much more\r\nserious, much more interesting. A large impersonal cause, the flooding\r\nof Europe with American silver, upsets all traditional standards of\r\npayment. The first brunt is borne by those whose incomes are fixed, or\r\nrelatively fixed, the owners of landed property, and the wage-earning\r\nclasses. But all over the country thousands of new bargains are being\r\nstruck as leases fall in and copies are renewed. Each fresh contract is\r\nthe opportunity for a readjustment of relationships, for shifting the\r\nburden from the shoulders where it rested. The wage-earners do this to\r\nsome extent, but not successfully; wages do not keep pace with prices.\r\nThe landlords do it much more effectively. But there is no mechanical\r\nmeans of measuring what change is necessary in order to place them and\r\ntheir tenants in the same position relatively to each other as they were\r\nbefore. Once customary fines are thrown overboard, there is, unless the\r\nGovernment interferes, no other standard except the full fine which can\r\nbe got in the open market, and, when the custom of the manor allows it\r\nto be demanded, it is demanded. Thus the readjustment, as it were,\r\novershoots itself, and the economic rent, unearned increment, surplus\r\nvalue--it is difficult to avoid phrases which modern associations have\r\nmade trite--only part of which represents the rise in the price of land\r\ncaused by the fall in the value of money, tends, instead of being, as\r\nhitherto, shared between landlord and copyholder, to be transferred _en\r\nbloc_ to the former. It is rarely in modern society that classes are\r\nsufficiently definite and self-contained, rarely that economic changes\r\nare sufficiently catastrophic, for a great shifting of income from one\r\nto the other to be detected. Here we can see it going on before our\r\neyes. We can note the result. But in this matter the twentieth century\r\nis not in a position to be critical of the sixteenth.\r\n\r\n    [547] Norden, _The Surveyor's Dialogue_, Book I.: \"_Surveyor._\r\n    The tennant leaveth commonly one either in right of inheritance,\r\n    or by surrender, to succeed him, and he by custome of the manor\r\n    is to be accepted tenant, alwaies provided he must agree with\r\n    the lord, if the custome of the manor hold not the fine certain\r\n    as in few it doth.... _Farmer._ You much mistake it, for I will\r\n    show by ancient court rolls that the fine of that which is now\r\n    £20 was then but 13s. 4d., and yet will you say they are now as\r\n    they were then? _Surveyor._ Yea, and I thinke I erre little in\r\n    it. For if you consider the state of things then and now, you\r\n    shall find the proportion little differing; for so much are the\r\n    prices of things vendible ... now increased as may well be said\r\n    to exceed the prices then as much as £20 exceede the 13s. 4d.\"\r\n\r\nWe may now sum up this part of our subject. The extreme lucrativeness of\r\nsheep-farming, and the depreciation in the value of money, offered an\r\nincentive to landlords to make the most profitable use which they could\r\nof their property by amalgamating small holdings into large leasehold\r\nfarms, which were used mainly, though not entirely, for pasture. To\r\ncarry out this new policy they had to get rid of the small tenants. When\r\nthe tenants held at will, or were lessees for a short term of years,\r\nlords could do this without difficulty. When they were copyholders for\r\none life or more, they could do it more slowly; but still they could do\r\nit in time. When they were copyholders with an estate of inheritance,\r\nlords had only two alternatives--to induce them to accept leases, or to\r\nraise the fines for admission. The latter course enabled them to offer\r\nthe tenants the alternative of surrendering their holdings or paying the\r\nfull competitive price which could be got for them. And thus it caused\r\nan almost revolutionary deterioration in their position. Hitherto the\r\ncustom of the manor had been a dyke which protected them against the\r\ndownward pressure of competition, and behind which they built up their\r\nprosperity. Now the unearned increment was transferred from tenant to\r\nlandlord by the simple process of capitalising it in the fine demanded\r\non entry. The interest of the customary tenant, therefore, virtually\r\ndepreciated to the level of that of a leaseholder. The interest of the\r\nmanorial lord appreciated to the full and effective ownership of all\r\nsurpluses arising between the grant of one copy and the grant of the\r\nnext. Thus the differences in the degree of security enjoyed by\r\ncopyholders are to be explained by differences in manorial customs. Whom\r\ncustom helps the law helps; who by custom are without protection, are\r\nwithout protection from the law, except in so far as it gradually builds\r\nup a doctrine as to what is reasonable. Long after villeinage has\r\ndisappeared, copyholders still bear traces of having sprung from a class\r\nof whom the law was reluctant to take cognizance, traces of being\r\nnurtured in a \"villein nest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nTHE OUTCOME OF THE AGRARIAN REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n       \"Lords spiritual and temporal, have it in your mind This\r\n       world as it waveth, and to your tenants be kind.\"\r\n                    --_The Proclamation of the Commons_, Gairdner,\r\n                        _Letters and Papers of Henry VIII._,\r\n                        xii.

But this is both to exaggerate the\r\nimportance which economic questions occupied in the minds of the\r\ngoverning aristocracies of the age, and to credit them with a foresight\r\nwhich they did not possess. If they are to be called mercantilists, in\r\nEngland, at any rate, they wear their mercantilism with a difference; as\r\na vague habit of mind, not as a reasoned system of economic doctrines.\r\nTheir administrative optimism is the optimism of innocence as much as of\r\nomnipotence; the fruit of a self-confidence which, in the name of the\r\npublic interests, will prop a falling trade, or cut down a flourishing\r\none, with a bland naïveté unperturbed by the hesitations which perplex\r\neven the most courageous of modern protectionists. Though in several\r\ndepartments of life--in commercial policy, in the regulation of the wage\r\ncontract, in the relief of distress--the main lines drawn by Elizabethan\r\nstatesmen will stand for two centuries, much of their legislation is\r\nvery rough and ready; much of it again is undertaken after generations\r\nof dilatory experiments; much of it is devoid of any originality, and is\r\na mere reproduction on a national scale of the practice of individual\r\nlocalities, a reproduction which sometimes does less than justice to the\r\noriginal. If it is popular, it is popular because it tells men to do\r\nwhat most decent men have been doing for a long time already, and when\r\nit tells them to do something else it is carried out only with great\r\ndifficulty. If it is permanent, it is permanent not because\r\nParliamentary draughtsmen possess any great skill or foresight, but\r\nbecause, before the rise of modern industry, all social relationships\r\nhave a great amount of permanence. Though there was much interesting\r\nspeculation on economic matters, economic rationalism was as a practical\r\nforce almost negligible; and since the only instrument through which it\r\ncould have achieved influence was the monarchy, its lack of influence\r\nwas perhaps politically fortunate. Sixteenth century England was too\r\nbusy getting the State on to its feet to produce a Colbert. Lath and\r\nplaster Colberts built their card castles on the Council table of James\r\nand Charles, and all was in train for the sage paternal monarchy which\r\nwas the ideal of Bacon. But a wind blew from strange regions beyond\r\ntheir ken, and they were scattered before they could do much either for\r\ngood or evil, leaving, as they fled, a cloud of dark suspicion round all\r\nthose who would be wiser in the art of Government than their neighbours,\r\nfrom which, in the lapse of three centuries, the expert has hardly\r\nemerged. In spite of mercantilism, economic questions never became in\r\nEngland the pre-occupation of specialists. In spite of the genuine\r\nindignation roused by the sufferings of the weaker classes in society,\r\nquestions affecting them were questions which statesmen did not handle\r\nfor their own sake, but only in so far as they forced themselves into\r\nthe circle of political interests by cutting across the order, or\r\nmilitary defence, or financial system, of the country. Apart from these\r\nhigh matters of policy most members of the governing classes were\r\ninclined to answer petitions on the subject of economic grievances as\r\nPaget did to Somerset: Why can't you let it alone? \"What a good year ...\r\nis victuals so dear in England and nowhere else? If they and their\r\nfathers before them have lived quietly these sixty years, pastures being\r\nenclosed, the most part of these rufflers have least cause to\r\ncomplain.\"[548]\r\n\r\n    [548] Strype, _Ecclesiastical Memorials_. Sir William Paget to\r\n    the Lord Protector, July 7, 1549.\r\n\r\nThe subordinate place occupied by economic questions during our period\r\nmakes the attention which was given to the results of pasture-farming\r\nall the more remarkable. Though to the statesmanship of the sixteenth\r\ncentury the agrarian problem was one of the second order, it was, at any\r\nrate till the accession of Elizabeth, the most serious of its own class,\r\nand it was important enough to occupy Governments at intervals for over\r\na century and a half. The first Statute against depopulation was passed\r\nin 1489;[549] an abortive Bill was introduced into the House of Commons\r\nin 1656;[550] and between the two lies a series of seven Royal\r\nCommissions, twelve Statutes, and a considerable number of Proclamations\r\ndealing with one aspect or another of the enclosing movement, as well as\r\nnumerous decisions on particular cases by the Privy Council, the Court\r\nof Star Chamber, and the Court of Requests. This reaction of the new\r\nagrarian developments upon public policy is interesting in several ways.\r\nIt illustrates the growth of new classes and forms of social\r\norganisation, the methods and defects of sixteenth century\r\nadministration, and the ideas of the period as to the proper functions\r\nof the State in relation to an important set of questions, upon which\r\npolitical opinion was in some ways nearer to our own than it was to that\r\nof the age following the Civil War. Nor, perhaps, is it altogether\r\nwithout importance from the point of view of general history. We need\r\nnot discuss how far the reaction of some recent historians against the\r\nfamiliar judgments which contrast Tudor tyranny with the constitutional\r\nrevolutions of the seventeenth century as darkness with light, is likely\r\nto be permanent. But it is perhaps safe to say that it is in the sphere\r\nof social policy that their case is seen at its strongest. After all,\r\ntyranny is often the name which one class gives to the protection of\r\nanother. To the small copyholder or tenant farmer the merciless\r\nencroachments of his immediate landlord were a more dreaded danger than\r\nthe far-off impersonal autocracy of the Crown to which he appealed for\r\ndefence. The period in which he suffered most in the sixteenth century\r\nwas the interval between the death of the despotic Henry VIII. and the\r\naccession of the despotic Elizabeth. Though the interference of the\r\nTudor, and--in a feebler fashion--of the Stuart, Governments to protect\r\nthe peasantry was neither disinterested nor always effective, its\r\ncomplete cessation after 1642, and the long line of Enclosure Acts which\r\nfollow the revolution of 1688, suggest that, as far as their immediate\r\neconomic interests were concerned, the smaller landholders had more to\r\nlose than to gain from a revolution which took power from the Crown to\r\ngive it to the squires. The writers[551] who after 1750 turned with a\r\nsigh from the decaying villages which they saw around them, to glorify\r\nthe policy of the absolutist Governments of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries, were received with the ridicule which awaits all\r\nwho set themselves against a strong current of interests and ideas. But\r\nhistorically they were right. The revolution, which brought\r\nconstitutional liberty, brought no power to control the aristocracy who,\r\nfor a century and a half, alone knew how such liberty could be\r\nused--that blind, selfish, indomitable, aristocracy of county families,\r\nwhich made the British Empire and ruined a considerable proportion of\r\nthe English nation. From the galleries of their great mansions and the\r\nwalls of their old inns their calm, proud faces, set off with an\r\noccasional drunkard, stare down on us with the unshakable assurance of\r\nmen who are untroubled by regrets or perplexities, men who have deserved\r\nwell of their order and their descendants, and await with confidence an\r\neternity where preserves will be closer, family settlements stricter,\r\ndependents more respectful, cards more reliable, than in this imperfect\r\nworld they well can be. Let them have their due. They opened a door\r\nwhich later even they could not close. They fostered a tree which even\r\nthey could not cut down. But neither let us forget that to the poorer\r\nclasses its fruits were thorns and briars, loss of their little\r\nproperties, loss of economic independence, the hot fit of the hateful\r\nSpeenhamland policy, the cold fit of the more hateful workhouse\r\nsystem.[552] Those who would understand the social forces of modern\r\nEngland must realise that long disillusionment. Even in the seventeenth\r\ncentury there are whisperings of it. At the end of the Civil War there\r\nwere men who were dimly conscious that the freedom for which they had\r\nfought involved economic, as well as political and ecclesiastical,\r\nchanges. \"Wee the poor impoverisht commoners,\" wrote the leaders of a\r\nlittle band of agrarian reformers to the Council of War in 1649, \"claim\r\nfreedom in the common lands by vertue of this conquest over the King,\r\nwhich is gotten by our joynt consent.... If this freedom be not granted,\r\nwee that are the poor commoners are in a worse case than we were in the\r\nKing's day.\"[553] But from the reign of Henry VII. to the Civil War\r\nofficial opinion was as generally in favour of protecting the peasantry\r\nagainst the ruinous effects of agrarian innovations, as it was on the\r\nside of leaving the landlords free to work their will in the two\r\ncenturies which succeeded. We must explain this state of mind, for it\r\ncertainly needs explanation; and this will necessitate our looking at\r\nthe movements of the peasants and at their place in the State. We must\r\nestimate how far it was effective in practice; and to do this we must\r\nsay a few words about the administrative machinery of the Tudors and of\r\nthe first two Stuarts.\r\n\r\n    [549] 4 Henry VII., c. 19.\r\n\r\n    [550] Journal of House of Commons, December 19, 1656.

See Levy, _Large and Small Holdings_, p. 41.\r\n\r\n    [552] The general adoption of the \"Test Workhouse\" for the\r\n    able-bodied, which dates from the Poor Law Reform Act of 1884,\r\n    was the direct result of a one-sided reaction against the\r\n    disastrous Speenhamland policy.\r\n\r\n    [553] Camden Society, _Clarke Papers_, vol. ii. p. 217.\r\n\r\nIn almost all ages the first task of Governments is the preservation of\r\norder. Though the economic ideas of the sixteenth century were very\r\ndifferent from those of the nineteenth, one of the reasons which made it\r\nimpossible for the statesmen of the period to leave the land question\r\naltogether alone was the same as that which induced their successors to\r\ndeal with Irish land in 1870 and 1881. It was that agrarian discontent\r\ncreated a permanent supply of inflammable material, which a spark might\r\nturn into a conflagration. The years between 1500 and 1650 are the last\r\ngreat age of the peasant uprisings which, in all countries of Western\r\nEurope except France and Ireland, are incredible to-day as a romance of\r\ngiants, and hardly a generation in that stormy period elapsed without\r\none. Sometimes nothing more happened than a collision of justices and\r\ngentry with angry mobs who were tearing down hedges and restoring common\r\nto common again under mysterious figures who flit across the darkening\r\ncountry-side with weapons in their hands and the eternal insurrection of\r\nthe New Testament on their lips--Jack o' the Style, Pyrce Plowman, and\r\nthat prophetic Captain Pouch, who \"was sent of God to satisfie all\r\ndegrees whatsoever, and in this present work was directed by the Lord of\r\nHeaven.\"[554] Sometimes the discontent swelled to a small civil war, as\r\nit did in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire in 1536, and in the eastern and\r\nsouthern counties in 1549. The Lincolnshire rising and the Pilgrimage of\r\nGrace were, it is true, mainly motived by discontent with the attack on\r\nthe abbeys. But the explanation of their objects given by those\r\ninsurgents who were cross-examined by the Government makes it difficult\r\nto agree with Professor Gay that only an insignificant part was played\r\nin these movements by agrarian discontent. The truth is that we ought to\r\ndistinguish between the objects of different sections. The rebels of\r\n1536 were not a class, but almost the whole society of northern England,\r\nwhich suddenly rolls forward with all its members, spirituality and\r\nlaity, peasants and peers, in fervent motion together. The weaker side\r\nof these great conservative demonstrations was that, though all classes\r\nwere united against the régime typified by Cromwell, all classes were\r\nnot moved to the same degree by the same grievances. Even when the old\r\nreligion was the cause that took the gentry into the field, the humbler\r\nrebels were brought out as much by hatred of agrarian as of religious\r\ninnovations. The men of Lincolnshire marched under a banner embroidered\r\nwith a ploughshare, and laggards were spurred forward with the cry \"What\r\nwill ye do? Shall we go home and keep sheep?\"[555] In Cumberland the\r\nfour Captains of Penrith--Faith, Poverty, Pity, and Charity--marched in\r\nsolemn procession with drawn swords round Burgh Church, and then, having\r\nheard Mass, led their followers, with the blessing of the vicar, on a\r\ncrusade to put an end to gentlemen and to withhold rents and fines.[556]\r\nIn the North generally the arrival of Aske's messengers was a signal for\r\nthe wholesale plucking down of new enclosures; a programme of agrarian\r\nreform was included in the demands put forward at Doncaster; and Aske\r\nhimself told the Government at his examination that the practice of\r\nletting out farms over the heads of poor tenants was one of the causes\r\nof the rising.[557] A well-informed officer of State like Sir William\r\nPaget seems to have thought that even the rebellion which took place in\r\nDevonshire and Somersetshire in 1549, the causes of which were mainly\r\necclesiastical, was partly also agrarian.[558] In that year, indeed,\r\nnearly the whole of the southern counties, beginning in May with\r\nHertfordshire, from Norfolk in the east to Hampshire in the south and\r\nWorcester in the west, were driven into riot by disappointment with the\r\nineffective Royal Commission appointed in the preceding year. In 1550\r\nthere were disturbances in Kent, and the Government anticipated their\r\nappearance in Essex. In 1552 the Buckinghamshire peasants rose on\r\naccount of high rents and high prices. In 1554 Wyatt's[559] adherents\r\ndemanded that all pasture lands which had forcibly been seized by\r\npersons in power should be restored. In 1569 an armed band pulled down\r\nenclosures near Chinley[560] in Derbyshire, threatened to kill the\r\nencloser, and rescued by force those of their number who were arrested.\r\nTwenty-six years later, at a time of unusually high prices, even the\r\npeasantry of Oxfordshire,[561] that most imperturbable of English\r\ncounties, planned \"to knock down the gentlemen and rich men who made\r\ncorn so dear, and who took the commons.\" In 1607 in the Midlands, where\r\nin the preceding decade enclosure and depopulation had created a\r\nsituation as acute as that of half a century before, there was a riot\r\nwhich resulted in the appointment of a Royal Commission.\r\n\r\n    [554] For Captain Pouch see Gay, _Trans.

But though henceforward the hatred of the new agrarian régime ran\r\nfor the most part underground, it had been burned too deep into the\r\nminds of the people to be lightly forgotten, and more than once its\r\nsmouldering embers flickered up in occasional riots. In the first flush\r\nof the army's victory over King and Parliament, when the shattering of\r\nauthority seemed for a moment to make all things new, not only the\r\npolitical, but the economic, ideas of two centuries later burst for a\r\nmoment, as in an early spring, into wonderful and premature life. The\r\nprogramme of the Levellers, who more than any other party could claim to\r\nexpress the aspirations of the unprivileged classes, included a demand\r\nnot only for annual or biennial Parliaments, manhood suffrage, a\r\nredistribution of seats in proportion to population, and the abolition\r\nof the Veto of the House of Lords, but also \"that you would have laid\r\nopen all enclosures of fens and other commons, or have them enclosed\r\nonly or chiefly for the benefit of the poor.\"[562] Theoretical\r\ncommunism, repudiated by some of the Levellers, found its expression in\r\nthe agitation of the Diggers, those \"true born sons and friends of\r\nEngland\" who, under Everard and Winstanley, set themselves, in the\r\nspirit of an Owenite Community, to convert the waste land at Weybridge\r\ninto the New Jerusalem.[563] For to many earnest souls the day of the\r\nLord seems very near, and Israel must make ready against it, not with\r\nanguish of spirit only, but with spade labour upon the barren earth. The\r\ncontrast between the prevalence of organised agrarian revolts in the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century, dragging on in small sporadic\r\nagitations for nearly one hundred years, with their comparative rarity\r\ntwo hundred years later, when similar causes were at work to produce\r\nthem, marks the new grouping of social classes and economic forces which\r\nwas going on apace in our period. The intelligence of toiling England,\r\nthat for a century now has gone to build up a new civilisation in\r\nfactory and mine, in trade union and co-operative store, still lay in\r\nthe larger villages, its immemorial home. Discontent travelled across\r\nthe enclosing counties as it does to-day in a Welsh mining valley,\r\noutcoursing oppression itself, like Elijah running before Ahab into\r\nJezreel. \"If three or four good fellows would ride in the night with\r\nevery man a bell, and cry in every town that they pass, 'To Swaffham! To\r\nSwaffham!' by the morning there would be ten thousand assembled at the\r\nleast; and then one bold fellow to stand forth and say, 'Sirs, now we be\r\nhere assembled, you know how little favour the gentlemen bear us poor\r\nmen.... Let us ... harness ourselves.'\"[564] Good fellows and bold were\r\nnot wanting. \"From that time forward no man could keep his servant at\r\nplough; but every man that could bear a staff went forward.\"[565] Before\r\nthe appearance of almost universal leasehold tenure, standing armies,\r\nand omnipotent aristocratic Parliaments, unrest among the rural\r\npopulation might cause the Government a not inexpensive campaign, in\r\nwhich the reluctant militia of yesterday were the enthusiastic rebels of\r\nto-day, and there was not therefore much disparity between the\r\ndiscipline and equipment of the forces engaged on either side. Both in\r\nthe mainly agrarian revolts in Norfolk, and in the mainly religious\r\nrevolts in Devonshire, the peasants fell, as they hoped they might, like\r\nmen, and it was the arquebuses of the foreign mercenaries which really\r\ndecided the struggle. Poor homeless hirelings, what could they know but\r\nto clamour for their pay, and shoot better men than themselves?\r\n\r\n    [562] The Humble Petition of thousands well affected persons\r\n    inhabiting the city of London, Westminster, the Borough of\r\n    Southwark, Hamlets, and places adjacent.

The agrarian disturbances of\r\nour period possess certain features which are of interest even to those\r\nwho are concerned primarily not with social politics, but with economic\r\norganisation. In the first place, they mark the transition from the\r\nfeudal revolts of the fifteenth century, based on the union of all\r\nclasses in a locality against the central government, to those in which\r\none class stands against another through the opposition of economic\r\ninterests. In the Lincolnshire rebellion and in the Pilgrimage of Grace\r\nthe old spirit predominated. In the North of England the new agrarian\r\nrégime had not proceeded far enough to sap entirely the ancient bonds\r\nbetween landlord and tenant, and the plunder of the monastic estates had\r\nnot yet set a commercial aristocracy in the seat of the old-fashioned\r\nCatholic landlords. The commons of Westmoreland, who declare that they\r\nwill trust no gentlemen with their councils, nevertheless feel\r\nsufficient confidence in Lord Darcy to write to him for his advice as to\r\nhow far they will be justified in insisting on reduced admission fines,\r\nand in pulling down \"all the intakes yt be noysum for poor men.\"[566]\r\nHad the Catholic gentry generally been willing to sacrifice the rents\r\ngot from pasture-farming, these movements might have found leaders who\r\nwould have made them more formidable. As it was, even when hatred of the\r\nreligious changes or of some particular piece of legislation, like the\r\nunpopular Statute of Uses, enrolled the gentry with the peasants, as in\r\nLincolnshire and Yorkshire in 1536, the incompatibility of the allies\r\nwas obvious, and the presence of the wealthier classes inspired distrust\r\namong the rank and file, who saw in them the authors of their economic\r\nevils, and who, though genuinely concerned at the painful destruction of\r\nthe social institutions of the old religion, were fighting mainly for\r\nthe maintenance of \"old customs and tenant right,\" fair rents and\r\nsecurity of tenure. In spite of the temporary union of all classes in\r\n1536, the insurgents tended to break up into two camps corresponding\r\nroughly with the division between landlord and tenant. In Lincolnshire,\r\nthough the commons were influenced by the gentry so far as to demand the\r\nrepeal of the Act of Uses, \"not knowing,\" as a witness said, \"what that\r\nAct of Uses meant,\" they showed their distrust of the upper classes by\r\nrefusing to allow them to discuss their future policy apart from the\r\ngeneral body of insurgents, while the extremists clamoured that \"they\r\nought to kill some of the justices; also that if they hanged for this,\r\nthey would not leave one gentleman alive in Lincolnshire.\"[567] At\r\nRichmond all lords and gentlemen were to swear on the mass-book to\r\nmaintain the profit of Holy Church, to take nothing of their tenants but\r\nthe usual rents, to put down Cromwell and not to go to London, on pain\r\nof death if they refused.[568] For courts have strange arts of\r\nseduction, and though London (thank Heaven) is not England now, it was\r\nstill less England then. The rough rhymes that ran through the North\r\ncontain the warning of all popular movements against the treachery of\r\nleaders, the sad eternal warning which buoys the sands where so many\r\nhigh endeavours have gone to wreck. \"All commons stick ye together, rise\r\nwith no great man till ye know his intent. Keep your harness in your\r\nhands, and ye shall obtain all your purpose in all this North land....\r\nClaim ye old customs and tenant right, to take your farms by a God's\r\npenny, all gressums and heightenings to be laid down. Then may we serve\r\nour sovereign Lord King Henry VIII., God save his noble Grace.\r\n\r\n        We shall serve our lands' lords in every righteous cause\r\n        With horse and harness as custom will demand.\r\n        Lords spiritual and temporal have it in your mind\r\n        This world as it waveth, and to your tenants be kind.\r\n        Adieu, gentle commons, thus make I an end:\r\n        Writer of this letter, pray Jesu be his speed;\r\n        He shall be your captain, when that ye have need.\"[569]\r\n\r\n    [566] _Ibid._, vol. xi., 1080.\r\n\r\n    [567] Gairdner, _L. and P.

The Proclamation of the Commons; see also _ibid._, 138, the\r\n    manifesto which says, \"Ye shall have captains just and true, and\r\n    not be stayed by the gentry in no wise.\"\r\n\r\nThe temporary solidarity which had drawn all classes into the Pilgrimage\r\nof Grace, though it flickered up for the last time in the feudal revolt\r\nof the northern earls in 1569, was absent altogether from the widespread\r\nagitation of 1549 to 1550. Except in Devonshire and Cornwall, the\r\ndisturbances of those years were purely agrarian, a movement of tenants\r\nagainst landlords. The Eastern rebels were for leaving \"as many\r\ngentlemen in Norfolk as there be white bulls\";[570] the gentry responded\r\nby rallying to the Government; and both in that country and in\r\nDevonshire the military forces which put down the peasants were led by\r\nthe two most notoriously unpopular landlords in England, who had built\r\nup their estates out of confiscated abbey lands, the Earl of Warwick and\r\nSir William Herbert. In the reign of Henry VII. the problem before\r\nGovernments had still been to prevent a great landlord from using his\r\nauthority over his tenants to make war on his neighbours or on the\r\nState. Sixty years later it is to prevent tenants in several different\r\ncounties from combining against landlords. The landed classes recognise\r\nthe new spirit. They denounce the peasants as communists and agitators;\r\nand when they get a free hand, as in the years from 1549 to 1553, they\r\ninsist on legislation which will make effective combination impossible.\r\n\r\n    [570] Russell, _Ket's Rebellion in Norfolk_, Introduction, p. 8.\r\n    The advice of John Walker of Griston.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the way in which the agrarian agitations were\r\nconducted is interesting as showing both the comparative prosperity and\r\nindependence of the English peasantry, even at a time when the fortunes\r\nof many of them were declining, and the general conceptions of social\r\nexpediency held by what was regarded as the most representative part of\r\nthe English nation. It would be a mistake to think of the rebels who\r\njoined these revolts as mere unorganised malcontents, with nothing to\r\nlose. There is no resemblance at all, either in personnel or methods,\r\nbetween the agrarian disturbances of our period and the riots of\r\nstarving agricultural labourers who burned ricks under Captain Swing in\r\nthe early nineteenth century. The peasants who formed the backbone of\r\nthe movements were often well-to-do men, who were fighting to keep their\r\nland with the dreadful tenacity of small proprietors. They had arms and\r\nwere accustomed to their use. They had sufficient money to raise common\r\nfunds. They included among their number sanguine and pertinacious\r\nlitigants who, so far from being disposed to throw up their case at the\r\nhint of the landlord's displeasure, were quite capable of making his\r\nlife one long lawsuit. The readiness of a class to make effective the\r\nprotection given it by the law in the face of the opposition of powerful\r\nindividuals, quenched, alas! too often by ignorance, and timidity, and\r\ngenerations of dull oppression, is a very good test of its spirit and of\r\nthe practical freedom which it enjoys. In the sixteenth century, though\r\nwe certainly see many gross cases of intimidation, we also see tenants\r\nappealing to the law courts and to the Government over the heads of\r\nlords of manors. Such appeals are a proof of the helplessness of the\r\nvictims which has been commented on above. But they are also a proof of\r\nthe persistence and cohesion of some among them. For while in the\r\nabsence of oppression they would not have been necessary, in the absence\r\nof a determination to resist oppression they could not have been made.\r\nTo enclose was in parts of the country to stir up a hornet's nest. There\r\nwas not much obsequiousness about the villagers of Thingden,[571] who\r\nfrom 1494 to 1538 pursued their landlord through almost every Court in\r\nthe Kingdom. The leaders of the popular agitation were often the more\r\nprosperous among the middle-classes. Sanders, the general in the\r\ninterminable struggle over the common lands of the city of Coventry\r\nwhich began in 1460, was a member of the important craft of Dyers, and\r\nhad occupied the high civic office of Chamberlain.[572] At Louth[573]\r\nthe initiative among the commons was taken by a tailor and a weaver.\r\nKet[574] himself was a considerable landed proprietor as well as a\r\ntanner.\r\n\r\n    [571] Selden Society, _Select Cases in the Court of Star\r\n    Chamber_, and Leadam, _E.

Everywhere there were the throwing down of\r\nenclosures and the driving of sheep.[575] In Yorkshire the enclosures\r\nwhich were pulled down seem to have been mainly intakes from the waste,\r\nand in Norfolk and the Midlands enclosures of arable land which had been\r\nconverted to pasture. In Warwickshire the Earl of Warwick's park was\r\ndemolished, while in Wiltshire, where Sir William Herbert had acquired\r\nthe lands of Wilton Abbey, and enclosed a whole village in his new park\r\nat Washerne, the peasants rose and tore down the palings.[576] In the\r\nNorth generally the bitterest outcry seems to have arisen over the\r\nexcessive fines and \"gressums\" charged for the admission of\r\ncopyholders. In Cumberland[577] there was a general strike against the\r\npayment of rents, and almost everywhere there were complaints of the\r\ndiminution in the area available for pasturing the beasts of commoners\r\nthrough the enclosing by landlords of manorial wastes.\r\n\r\n    [575] Sheep-driving in the sixteenth century was like\r\n    cattle-driving in Ireland to-day; see Gairdner, _L. and P. Henry\r\n    VIII._, vol. xii., Part I., 201: \"When they first went to York,\r\n    they drove one Coppyndale's sheep because he fled away, and sold\r\n    them again to his deputy for £10,\" and the behaviour of the\r\n    Norfolk rebels in 1549.\r\n\r\n    [576] Gairdner, _L. and P._, xi., II., 186, and _Rutland MSS._,\r\n    p. 36, quoted by Leadam: \"There is a great number of the commons\r\n    up about Salisbury in Wiltshire, and they have plucked down Sir\r\n    William Herbert's Park that is about his new house ... they say\r\n    they will not have their common grounds to be enclosed and taken\r\n    from them.\"\r\n\r\n    [577] Gairdner, _L. and P._, xii., I., 362: \"Your rents and\r\n    others cannot yet be collected.\"\r\n\r\nThough it involves abandoning the order of events, let us illustrate by\r\na single example[578] the shape assumed by agrarian rioting, which has\r\nnot yet become a rebellion. In the summer of 1569, when Cecil and\r\nElizabeth were waiting anxiously for news from those northern counties\r\nwhich \"know no other prince but a Percy,\" there was much running and\r\nriding, much sending for warrants and plentiful delay in their\r\nexecution, in the wild country between Chinley and Bakewell, whose\r\ncentre is the Peak, and whose principal gorge now carries the most\r\nbeautiful piece of railway line in England. The Derbyshire peasantry\r\nseem to have been ill to deal with. A few years later some of those in\r\nGlossopdale succeeded in setting the Earl of Shrewsbury at defiance,\r\nand, when evicted from their farms, induced the Council to intervene to\r\ninsist on their reinstatement.[579] Just now those of them who lived in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Chinley were in a ferment over the enclosure of\r\nsome common land. The story is a curious one, and shows both the kind of\r\nconditions under which agrarian discontent developed, and the way in\r\nwhich it was associated in the mind of the Government with fears of\r\npolitical disturbance. The Duchy of Lancaster, to whom the land near\r\nChinley belonged, had let a parcel of herbage called Mayston Field to\r\none Lawrence Wynter, his lease to begin as soon as that of the existing\r\ntenant had expired. In that age of land speculation land changed hands\r\nrapidly. On the same day as Wynter obtained the lease he sold it to a\r\ncertain Richard Celey. Celey transferred it to Godfrey Bradshaw, and\r\nGodfrey Bradshaw got rid of it to his brother Anthony. The trouble began\r\nwhen the land came into the hands of Godfrey Bradshaw. He started to\r\nhedge and ditch it, which of course involved the exclusion of the other\r\ninhabitants from the rights of pasture which they had hitherto enjoyed.\r\nAccordingly the villagers, led by twelve of their number, of whom four\r\nbelonged to one family, removed the ditch, tore down the enclosure,\r\nwhich consisted of \"XLIII hundredth quicksetts willowes and willowe\r\nstackes ... and did utterlye destroy and cutt the sayd stacks and quick\r\nsetts in pieces,\" proceeding at the same time, with the object of\r\nprotecting their own grazing land against encroachments, themselves to\r\ndivide up the land into smaller enclosures to be held by each man in\r\nseveralty. Godfrey Bradshaw then obtained warrants for the preservation\r\nof the peace against the ringleaders, and at the same time induced the\r\nlessor, who was Sir Ralph Sadler, the Chancellor of the Duchy, to\r\naddress a letter to them directing them not to interfere with any\r\nhouses, hedges, or ditches, which might in future be constructed round\r\nthe land. They received his communication, but massed in force with arms\r\non Chinley Hill, pulled down what still remained of Bradshaw's hedges,\r\nand then proceeded to organise the nucleus of a very pretty agitation.\r\nThey gave part of the herbage, which was nominally in the occupation of\r\nthe unfortunate lessee, to one William Beard, on condition that, after\r\nthe manner of his betters in the good old days before the Tudors, he\r\nshould \"maynteyn them geynst the Queenes Majestie,\" his support taking\r\nthe form of an agreement that he \"should from tyme to tyme send them\r\nYdill ryotouse p'sons to assyste them in these yll doinges.\" They then\r\nraised a fund, presumably by a levy on the inhabitants, called a meeting\r\nin the forest of High Peak, and set off about the tenth of June to\r\nBakewell for a further conference, arranging in the meantime that some\r\none should burn Godfrey Bradshaw's house, and that while his enclosures,\r\nif re-erected, should be pulled down, the other inhabitants should make\r\nhaste to divide up the disputed land into twenty-one separate parcels.\r\nWhen the Bradshaws, having got their warrants, tried with the aid of the\r\nvillage constable to execute them, their opponents (\"the land was\r\ngrabbed from him, and he did what any decent man would do\"[580])\r\nthreatened them with murder, and, on one of the party being actually\r\narrested, came very near to carrying their threat out. \"The said p'tyes\r\n... did ryotouslye assemble themselves together in great companies at\r\nthe town of Hayfield with unlawfull weapons, that is to saye, with\r\nbowes, pytchefforkes, clobbes, staves, swords, and daggers drawen, and\r\nryotouslye dyd then and there assaulte and p'sue the sayd Godfrey and\r\nEdward Bradshawe, and in ryotouse manner dyd reskewe and take from them\r\nthe body of the sayd Richard Shower, being attached; the Queenes\r\nOfficer, George Yeavely of Bawdon, then being p'sent commanding the\r\npeace to be kepte.\" Having chased the enemy for some distance, they\r\ncamped on the contested territory, and kept a watchful eye and a firm\r\nhand for any sign of the reappearance of the detested hedges. More\r\nserious still in the eyes of the Government (and this, one suspects, was\r\ntheir undoing), the leaders of this village revolution went so far as to\r\nentangle themselves in high politics. At their examination they are\r\nasked, \"Whether dyd Reynold Kirke about May day last paste, and dyvers\r\ntymes since and before, or any other tyme, confederate, consulte,\r\npractise, or otherwise confer and talk with one Mr. Bircles of the\r\ncountye of Chester ... touching or concerning prophesis by noblemen, or\r\notherwise, and what books of prophesie have you or the said Bircles seen\r\nor heard, and what is the effect thereof, and how often have you or he\r\nperused, used, or conferred of the same, or about such purposes, and\r\nwith whom?\" We do not know how they answered this question. It may be\r\nthat the anger of these Derbyshire peasants at their vanishing commons\r\nwas indeed a fraction to be set among weightier assets by schemers in\r\nhigh places, and that the sinister Mr. Bircles had really talked with\r\nthem of matters more serious than the pulling down of hedges and the\r\nbaiting of enclosers, of things forbidden to the vulgar, of the\r\nscattering of upstart officials, of the restoration of a Catholic\r\nmonarchy, of Mary, who in the previous year had made her irrevocable\r\nplunge across the Border. It may be merely that all in authority had\r\nthat autumn an unusually bad attack of nerves. In 1569 the North was\r\nfull of prophets, both noble and other.\r\n\r\n    [578] I take this story from a transcript kindly supplied me by\r\n    Mr. Kolthammer of MSS. in the possession of Charles E. Bradshaw\r\n    Bowles of Wirksworth.\r\n\r\n    [579] Lodge, _Illustrations_, ii. p. 218.\r\n\r\n    [580] Synge, _The Playboy of the Western World_.\r\n\r\nIt was not always the case, however, that agrarian discontent ended in\r\ncasual rioting of this kind. Of mere destructive violence there is,\r\nindeed, in all the social disturbances of the period, singularly little.\r\nThere was a good deal in the routine of rural life, with its common\r\nadministration of land and dependence on a collectively binding custom,\r\nto teach habits of discipline and co-operation. It must be remembered\r\nthat those who took the initiative in breaking the law were not the\r\npeasants who pulled down enclosures, but the landlords who made them in\r\ndefiance of repeated statutes forbidding them. On the whole the\r\norganised character of the action taken is more conspicuous than the\r\nindividual excesses, and if one is to look for a modern analogy to the\r\nmixture of deliberation and violence which it shows, it must be sought\r\nin an Irish fair rent campaign rather than in the bread riots of a\r\ndespairing urban proletariat. When the agitation was confined to\r\nindividual manors it occasionally took the form of agrarian trade\r\nunionism. Tenants collectively decline to serve as jurors in the court\r\nof the manor till their demands are granted.[581] They raise a common\r\npurse.[582] They refuse to pay more than a certain rent. When more than\r\none manor is implicated different localities display a rough cohesion.\r\nWhole communities seem to have joined the movement in 1536 and 1540 with\r\na certain formality. In Lincolnshire and Yorkshire townships were\r\nbrought out on the ringing of the town bell with the cohesion of a\r\nwell-organised trade union; Beverley[583] sent messages to the\r\nLincolnshire rebels under its common seal; and the part which was played\r\nby the village officers in the movements of the peasantry is proved by\r\nthe Proclamation[584] which the Council issued in 1549, when disorders\r\nwere at their height, forbidding constables, bailiffs, and head-boroughs\r\nto call meetings except for the purposes required by the law.\r\nHales,[585] as he rode through the South and Midlands in 1548, was\r\nstruck by the patience with which people waited for the Government to\r\ntake action, and attributed the disturbances of the ensuing year to the\r\ndespair caused by the victory of the local landlords over the\r\nCommission, and to the rejection by Parliament of the Bills which he had\r\nintroduced. Even Ket's campaign in Norfolk, which ended in a sanguinary\r\nbattle, during the greater part of it was carried on with an orderliness\r\nfrom which the Government which suppressed it might profitably have\r\ntaken a lesson. Nothing could have been more unlike the popular idea of\r\na _jacquerie_. The peasants enjoyed the enormous joke of making the\r\ngentry look foolish a great deal more than cutting their throats, as\r\nduring the four weeks in which they were \"playing\" they might have done\r\nwithout any difficulty.\r\n\r\n          \"Mr. Pratt, your sheep are very fat,\r\n            And we thank _you_ for that;\r\n          We have left you the skins to pay your wife's pins,\r\n            And you must thank _us_ for that.\"[586]\r\n\r\n    [581] Selden Society, _Select Cases in the Court of Requests_\r\n    (Leadam).

Men may well be merry\r\ntogether, when they have seen hovering over the fields of an English\r\ncounty, though but in a fleeting glimpse, the New Jerusalem where the\r\nhumble are exalted and the mighty put down; and there is no\r\ninconsistency between such mundane gaiety and the long pent up passion\r\nwhich on the lips of a nameless labourer burst into the cry, \"As sheepe\r\nor lambs are a prey to the wolfe or lion, so are the poor men to the\r\nrich men.\"[587] There was much lecturing (the matter is easily imagined)\r\nat the Oak of Reformation, and not on one side only, for the peasants\r\nwere tolerant compared with their betters, and a future archbishop was\r\nallowed to address the insurgents on the evils of their ways; much\r\nlaying down of hedges and enclosures; much slaughtering of that beast of\r\niniquity, the man-devouring sheep. There was none of the massacring of\r\nunarmed men which both Henry VIII. and Elizabeth ordered without\r\ncompunction when they thought the times required it, very little of the\r\n\"making the public good a pretext for private revenge,\" against which\r\nthe insurgents were warned by Parker. Though for months after the final\r\ntragedy the badges of the justly-hated Warwick \"were not so fast set up\r\nbut that they were as fast pulled down\" from the city walls, the rebels\r\neven in the heat of their early triumphs claimed only to be executing\r\nthe Protector's Proclamations, and, while indignantly repudiating the\r\nname of traitors, showed a complete readiness to negotiate peaceably\r\nwith the Government. The whole movement was less a rising against the\r\nState than a practical illustration of the peasants' ideals, a mixture\r\nof May-day demonstration and successful strike embodied in one gigantic\r\nfestival of rural good fellowship. Its bloody termination was, as far as\r\ncan be judged, the result of two errors of judgment, one, a pardonable\r\none, on the part of Ket, the other, unpardonable, on the part of a\r\nnameless member of the other party.[588] When all was over, and each man\r\nreflected after his kind on the great days of Mousehold Heath, what the\r\ncamp followers, who attach themselves to every popular movement,\r\nremembered was that for about a month they had filled their bellies at\r\nother people's expense. \"'Twas a merry world when we were yonder,\r\neating of mutton.\" But there were some who, as they saw Ket swinging on\r\nthe gallows before the City gates, were seized with the tumult of pity\r\nand hoarse indignation which serves Englishmen, who are not good at\r\nrevolutions, in place of the revolutionary spirit. \"O Kette,\" one\r\ncountryman was heard to say to another, \"God have mercy upon thy soul;\r\nand I trust in God that the King's Majesty and his Councell shall be\r\nenformed once between this and Midsummer evening, that of their own\r\ngentleness thou shalt be taken down and buried, not hanged up for winter\r\nstore; and set a quietness in the realm, and that the ragged staff shall\r\nbe taken down of their own gentleness from the gentlemen's gates in this\r\nCity, and to have no more King's arms but one within the City, under\r\nChrist.\"[589] The Council, in its gentleness, thought otherwise. Ket\r\nstill creaked in his chains, and in the meantime other gallows were\r\nrising for other rebels in Somerset, and Devon, and Cornwall.\r\n\r\n    [587] _Original Papers of the Norfolk and Norwich Archæological\r\n    Society_, 1905, p. 22.\r\n\r\n    [588] Ket refused the pardon offered on July 31st on the ground\r\n    that the insurgents had committed no offence requiring to be\r\n    pardoned, and fighting followed. On August 23rd a pardon was\r\n    again offered. While it was being read by a herald, a boy\r\n    standing by insulted him \"with words as unseemly as his gesture\r\n    was filthy\" (Holinshed), and was shot by one of the herald's\r\n    retinue. Ket tried to pacify the anger of his followers at what\r\n    they took to be treachery, but without effect.\r\n\r\n    [589] _Original Papers of the Norfolk and Norwich Archæological\r\n    Society_, 1905, p. 20.\r\n\r\nWhat were the aims which at intervals between 1530 and 1560 set half the\r\ncounties of England in a blaze? Let us look at the peasants' programme\r\nmore closely. It will help us to see the agrarian problem from the\r\ninside. Reduced to its elements their complaint is a very simple one,\r\nvery ancient and yet very modern. It is that what, in effect, whatever\r\nlawyers may say, has been their property, is being taken from them. To\r\nbe told that social disorders take place because an envious proletariat\r\naims at seizing the property of the rich would seem to them a very\r\nstrange perversion of the truth. They want only to have what they have\r\nalways had. They are conservatives, not radicals or levellers, and to\r\nthem it seems that all the trouble arises because the rich have been\r\nstealing the property of the poor. Here is part of a colloquy[590]\r\nbetween Jack of the North beyond the Style, Robin and Harry Clowte, Tom\r\nof Trumpington, Peter Potter, Pyrce Plowman, and divers other worthies.\r\nAs will be seen from the verses, they are birds of night--\r\n\r\n      \"JACK. Now for that Slaunder's sake,\r\n    Companye by night I take,\r\n    And, with all that I may make,\r\n    Cast hedge and ditch in the lake,\r\n    Fyxed with many a stake\r\n    Though it was never so faste\r\n    Yet asondre it is wraste.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      HARRY CLOWTE.

But the more far-seeing of the peasants realise what\r\ntheir followers do not, that these troubles which are going on in so\r\nmany different parts of England cannot be dealt with by isolated bodies\r\nof villagers, however good their cause may be. They require the\r\nintervention of the Government. How the Government is to intervene they\r\nlay down in two documents which are perhaps the only two popular\r\nprogrammes of agrarian reform ever published in England since 1381. The\r\nfirst, contained in two of the articles[591] drawn up at Doncaster in\r\n1536, is short enough:--\r\n\r\n\"That the lands in Westmoreland, Cumberland, Kendall, Dent, Sedbergh,\r\nFurness, and the abbey lands in Mashamshire, Kyrkbyshire, Notherdale,\r\nmay be by tenant right, and the lord to have, at every change, 2\r\nyears' rent for gressum, according to the grant now made by the lords to\r\nthe commons there. This to be done by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"The Statutes for Enclosures and Intacks to be put in execution, and all\r\nenclosures and Intacks since the fourth year of Henry VII. to be pulled\r\ndown, except mountains, forests, and Parks\" (a noticeable exception\r\nwhich shows the composite character of the movement. In the South of\r\nEngland the peasant did not spare parks).\r\n\r\n    [591] Gairdner, _L. and P. of Henry VIII._, xi. 1246.\r\n\r\nThe articles[592] signed by Ket, Aldryche, and Cod in 1549 are a much\r\nmore elaborate affair. Here are the most noteworthy of them:--\r\n\r\n\"We pray your grace that where it is enacted for enclosing, that it be\r\nnot hurtful to such as have enclosed saffren grounds, for they be\r\ngreatly chargeable to them, and that from henceforth no man shall\r\nenclose any more.[593]\r\n\r\n\"We certify your grace that whereas the lords of the mannors hath been\r\ncharged with certe fre rent, the same lords hath sought means to charge\r\nthe freeholders to pay the same rent, contrary to right.\r\n\r\n\"We pray your grace that no lord of no manor shall comon uppon the\r\ncommons.\r\n\r\n\"We pray that priests from henceforth shall purchase no lande neither\r\nfree nor bondy, and the lands that they have in possession may be letten\r\nto temporal men, as they were in the first year of the reign of King\r\nHenry VII.[594]\r\n\r\n\"We pray that reed ground and meadow ground may be at such price as they\r\nwere in the first year of King Henry VII.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We pray that the payments of castleward rent, and blanch ferm and\r\noffice lands, which hath been accustomed to be gathered of the\r\ntenements, whereas we suppose the lords ought to pay the same to their\r\nbailiffs for their rents gathering, and not the tenants.[595]\r\n\r\n\"We pray that no man under the degree of a knight or esquire keep a dove\r\nhouse, except it hath been of an old ancient custom.\r\n\r\n\"We pray that all freeholders and copyholders may take the profits of\r\nall commons, and there to common, and the lords not to common nor to\r\ntake profits of the same.\r\n\r\n\"We pray that no feudatory within your shires shall be a councellor to\r\nany man in his office making, whereby the King may be truly served, so\r\nthat a man being of good conscience may be yearly chosen to the same\r\noffice by the commons of the same shire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We pray that copyhold land that is unreasonably rented may go as it did\r\nin the first year of King Henry VII., and that at the death of a tenant\r\nor of [at] a sale the same lands to be charged with an easy fine, as a\r\ncapon or a reasonable [sum] of money for a remembrance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We pray that all bondmen may be made free, for God made all free with\r\nhis precious bloodshedding.\r\n\r\n\"We pray that rivers may be free and common to all men for fishing and\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We pray that the poor mariners or Fishermen may have the whole profits\r\nof their fishings, as porpoises, grampuses, whales, or any great fish,\r\nso it be not prejudicial to your Grace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We pray that it be not lawful to the lords of any manor to purchase\r\nland freely, or [and] to let them out again by copy of court roll to\r\ntheir great advancement and to the undoing of your poor subjects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We pray that no man under the degree of ... shall keep any conies upon\r\nany of their freehold or copyhold, unless he pale them in, so that it\r\nshall not be to the common nuisance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We pray that your Grace give license and authority by your gracious\r\ncommission under your Great Seal to such commissioners as your poor\r\ncommons hath chosen, or to as many of them as your Majesty and your\r\nCouncil shall appoint and think meet, for to redress and reform all such\r\ngood laws, statutes, proclamations, and all other your proceedings,\r\nwhich hath been hidden by your justices of your peace, shreves,\r\nescheators, and other your officers, from your poor commons, since the\r\nfirst year of the reign of your noble grandfather, King Henry VII.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We pray that no lord, knight, esquire, nor gentleman, do graze nor feed\r\nany bullocks or sheep, if he may spend forty pounds a year by his lands,\r\nbut only for the provision of his house.\"\r\n\r\n    [592] Russell, _Ket's Rebellion in Norfolk_, p. 48.\r\n\r\n    [593] Some doubt has been expressed as to the interpretation of\r\n    these words. They should probably be read in the light of what\r\n    was said above (Part I. chap. iv.) as to enclosures made by the\r\n    tenants themselves. The rebels point out that a considerable\r\n    number of people have spent capital on hedging and ditching\r\n    their lands for the better cultivation of saffron, and therefore\r\n    ask that, while other enclosures may be pulled down, a special\r\n    exception may be made in favour of this particular kind of\r\n    enclosure.\r\n\r\n    [594] Contrast the feeling in Protestant Norfolk with that of\r\n    Cornwall and Devon in 1549, and of the North in 1536.\r\n\r\n    [595] The grammar is bad, but the sense is clear enough. Lords\r\n    must stop shifting on to tenants burdens which lords ought to\r\n    bear.\r\n\r\nThe programme of the peasants is partly political. The Northerners\r\ninsist that Parliament and the Crown must interfere, and the Norfolk\r\nleaders ask for a permanent commission to do the work which the county\r\njustices, who are interested in enclosing, have wilfully neglected. But\r\nit is mainly economic. The State is to do no more than restore the old\r\nusages, and the end of all is to be a sort of idealised manorial\r\ncustomary enforced by a strong central Government throughout the length\r\nof the land, free use of common lands, reduced rents of meadow and\r\nmarsh, reasonable fines for copyholds, free fisheries, and the abolition\r\nof the lingering disability of personal villeinage. The most striking\r\nthing about these demands is their conservatism. Almost exactly a\r\nhundred years later agrarian reform will be demanded as part of a new\r\nheaven and a new earth. Agrarian agitation will be carried on in terms\r\nof theories as to the social contract, of theories as to the origin of\r\nprivate property. Its leaders will be appealing to Anglo-Saxon history\r\nto prove to the indifferent ears of a Government which has saved them\r\n\"from Charles, our Norman oppressor,\" that \"England cannot be a free\r\ncommonwealth, unless the poore commoners have a use and benefit of the\r\nland.\"[596] They will appeal also to a more awful sanction than that of\r\nhistory. \"At this very day,\" cries Winstanley,[597] \"poor people are\r\nforced to work for 4d. a day and corn is dear, and the tithing-priest\r\nstops their mouths and tells them that 'inward satisfaction of mind' was\r\nmeant by the declaration 'the poor shall inherit the earth.' I tell you,\r\nthe scripture is to be really and materially fulfilled.... You jeer at\r\nthe name of Leveller. I tell you Jesus Christ is the head leveller.\"\r\nSuch communistic doctrines are always the ultimate fruit of the\r\nbreakdown of practical co-operation and brotherliness among men. To\r\nhuman nature, as to other kinds of nature, a vacuum is abhorrent.\r\n\r\n    [596] Camden Society, _Clarke Papers_, vol. ii. p. 217. Letter\r\n    addressed by the Diggers, December 8, 1649: \"To my lord generall\r\n    and his Councell of War.\" The allusion to the usurping Normans\r\n    occurs also (_ibid._, p. 215) in another letter in a statement\r\n    of the reasons of the agitation: \"Secondly by vertue of yours\r\n    and our victory over the king, whereby the enslaved people of\r\n    England have recovered themselves from under the Norman\r\n    Conquest; though wee do not yet enjoy the benefit of our\r\n    victories, nor cannot soe long as the use of the Common land is\r\n    held from the younger brethren by the Lords of Mannours that yet\r\n    sit in the Norman chair and uphold that tyranny as if the kingly\r\n    power were in force still.\"\r\n\r\n    [597] Winstanley: \"The curse and blessing that is in mankind,\"\r\n    quoted Gooch, _English Democratic Ideas in the Seventeenth\r\n    Century_.\r\n\r\nBut as yet the soil has not been ploughed by a century of political and\r\nreligious controversy, and there is little sign of these high arguments\r\nin the social disturbances of our period. The earliest levellers[598]\r\nget their name because they raze not social inequalities but quickset\r\nhedges and park palings. What communism there is in the movement is not\r\nthat of the saints or the theorists, but the spontaneous doctrineless\r\ncommunism of the open field village, where men set out their fields, and\r\nplough, and reap, laugh in the fine and curse in the wet, with natural\r\nfellowship. The middle-class terror of the appearance in England of the\r\npolitical theories of the German Peasants' War, though it was forcibly\r\nexpressed by Sir William Paget[599] in remonstrating with Somerset's\r\npolicy in 1549, and though John Hales thought it worth while to\r\nrepudiate it, is not justified by any recorded utterances or programmes\r\nwhich have come to us. There are, indeed, many verbal similarities\r\nbetween the articles of Ket and those put out by the German peasants at\r\nMemmingen in 1525, which suggest that some refugee from Germany had\r\ncarried them with him to the most Protestant county in England. Both,\r\nfor example, demand a reduction in rents, the abolition of villeinage,\r\nand free fisheries. But the contrasts are much more striking, and are\r\ndue not only to the fact that the onerous villein services which\r\nsurvived in Germany had become almost nominal in England, but to the\r\ndifference in the spirit of their conception, which leads one to appeal\r\nto the New Testament and the other to the customs of the first years of\r\nHenry VII. There is, in fact, the same broad difference between the\r\npeasant movements in England and Germany as there is between the English\r\nand German Reformation. In Germany the ecclesiastical changes spring\r\nfrom a widespread popular discontent, and are swept forward on a wave of\r\nradical enthusiasm, which carries the peasants (German Social Democrats\r\nare metaphysicians to this day) into the revolutionary mysticism of\r\nMünzer. In England changes in Church government are forced upon the\r\npeople by the State, and outside the South and East of England are\r\nregarded with abhorrence. It is not until the later rise of Puritanism\r\nthat either religious or economic radicalism becomes a popular force. In\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century the English peasants accepted the\r\nestablished system of society with its hierarchy of authorities and\r\ndivision of class functions, and they had a most pathetic confidence\r\nin the Crown. What they wanted, in the first place, was fair\r\nconditions of land tenure, the restoration of the customary\r\nrelationships which had protected them against the screw of commercial\r\ncompetition. When they went further, they looked for an exercise of\r\nRoyal Power to reduce to order the petty tyranny of local magnates, and\r\nto carry out the intentions of a Government which they were inclined to\r\nthink meant them well, \"to redress and reform all such good laws,\r\nstatutes, proclamations, and all other your proceedings which hath been\r\nbidden by your justices of your Peace ... from your poor commons.\" Such\r\nmovements are a proof of blood and sinew and of a high and gallant\r\nspirit. They are the outcome of a society where the normal relations are\r\nhealthy, where men are attached to the established order, where they\r\npossess the security and control over the management of their own lives\r\nwhich is given by property, and, possessing this, possess the reality of\r\nfreedom even though they stand outside the political state. Happy the\r\nnation whose people has not forgotten how to rebel.\r\n\r\n    [598] A reference to the Levellers occurs in connection with the\r\n    Midland Revolt of 1607, Lodge, _Illustrations_, iii. 320: \"You\r\n    cannot but have hearde what courses have been taken in\r\n    Leicestershire and Warwickshire by the two Lord Lieutenants\r\n    there, and by the gentlemen ... and lastlie howe Sir Anth.\r\n    Mildmay and Sir Edward Montacute repaired to Newton ... where\r\n    one thousand of these fellowes who term themselves levellers\r\n    were busily digging, but weare furnished with many half-pikes,\r\n    pyked staves, long bills, and bowes and arrows and stones ...\r\n    there were slaine some 40 or 50 of them and a verie great number\r\n    hurt\" (January 11, 1607, the Earl of Shrewsbury to Sir John\r\n    Manners, Sir Francis Leake, and Sir John Harper). The name\r\n    Diggers seems to have cropped up about the same time, v. _Wit\r\n    and Wisdom_, edited by Halliwell for New Shakespeare Society,\r\n    pp. 140-141, for a petition from \"the Diggers of Warwickshire to\r\n    all other diggers,\" and signed \"poore Delvers and Day Labourers\r\n    for ye good of ye commonwealth till death\" (quoted by Gay,\r\n    _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, New Series, vol. xviii.)\r\n\r\n    [599] See below, pp. 367-368.\r\n\r\nThe social disturbances caused by enclosure, with its accompaniments of\r\nrack-renting and evictions, were one cause which compelled the\r\nGovernments of our period to give attention to the subject. Though no\r\ndirect concessions were made to them, their lessons were not altogether\r\nwasted, because it is plain that they impressed on the minds of\r\nstatesmen the idea that to prevent disorder it was necessary for the\r\nState to interfere in favour of tenants. Rural discontent, which might\r\nhave been insignificant in an age of greater political stability,\r\nderived a factitious importance from the circumstances of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when it might be exploited by a rebellious minority, which, for\r\nall that most men knew, might really be a majority of the nation, by\r\nYorkist Plotters under Henry VII., religious enthusiasts under Henry\r\nVIII., restorers of a Catholic monarchy, supported by a Spanish invasion\r\nor a Franco-Scottish alliance, under Elizabeth. Governments so uncertain\r\nof their popularity as these had a strong reason for protecting the\r\nclass which would be the backbone of a revolt. One way in which they\r\ncould secure themselves against the discontent of the disaffected\r\nnobility was to encourage the yeomanry, who might act as a counterpoise.\r\nThe way in which self-preservation and a popular agrarian policy went\r\nhand in hand is illustrated by Burleigh's cynical advice to Elizabeth to\r\nmake a practice of supporting tenants in any quarrel which might arise\r\nbetween them and Catholic landlords.[600]\r\n\r\n    [600] _Somers' Tracts_, vol. i., pp. 164-168: \"For their\r\n    tenantries, this conceit I have thought upon ... that your\r\n    Majesty, in every shire, should give instruction to some that\r\n    are indeed trusty and religious gentlemen, that, whereas your\r\n    Majesty is given to understand that divers popish landlords do\r\n    hardly use some of your people and subjects, ... you do\r\n    constitute and appoint them to deal both with entreaty and\r\n    authority, that such tenants, paying as others do, be not thrust\r\n    out of their living, nor otherwise molested. This would greatly\r\n    bind the commons' hearts unto you, on whom indeed consisteth the\r\n    power and strength of your realm, and it will make them less, or\r\n    nothing at all, depend upon their landlords.\"\r\n\r\nBut there were other causes as well working in the same direction. No\r\none who reads the writers by whom the agrarian problem is discussed can\r\nfail to notice that the official view of the proper system of agrarian\r\nrelationships was on the whole favourable to the small man, and was,\r\nindeed, not very different from that expressed in the demands of the\r\npeasants themselves. Not, of course, that the authorities had any\r\nintention of depressing landlords or raising peasants, but that the\r\nwhole established system of Government was based on a certain\r\norganisation of social life, and that the Government tended to maintain\r\nthat organisation in maintaining itself and carrying on the work of the\r\nState. For this attitude, which is in striking contrast with the policy\r\nof the statesmen of the eighteenth century when faced with an analogous\r\nproblem, there were several practical reasons which we shall do well to\r\nunderstand. In judging the motives of economic policy in past ages we\r\nare even more apt to be misled by modern analogies than we are in\r\nestimating its effects. We see that in our own day most of the\r\nlegislative protection accorded to those who are economically weak has\r\nbeen produced by a combination of two causes, the political\r\nenfranchisement of the wage-earning classes and the spread of\r\nhumanitarian sentiment. We know that in the sixteenth century the first\r\ncause was absent and the second was feeble. The Macchiavellis of that\r\niron age were neither democrats nor philanthropists; and when they\r\navow a policy of protecting the weaker classes in society against\r\neconomic evils we are inclined to think with Professor Thorold Rogers\r\nthat they are merely hypocritical. But this analogy is a false light. To\r\nbe influenced by it is to confuse political power with its symbols, and\r\nto forget that the economic importance of a class may be a more\r\neffective claim to the interest of Governments than the ballot-box.\r\nUnder the Tudors there were strong practical reasons for protecting the\r\npeasantry which are not felt to the same extent to-day. The modern State\r\nhas so specialised its organs that its maintenance is quite compatible\r\nwith the existence of the extremes of poverty, not only among the\r\nexceptionally unfortunate, but among those whose position is not more\r\ninsecure than that of their neighbours. They may be able neither to\r\nfight, nor to take part in public duties, nor to contribute much to the\r\nExchequer. But if their incompetence is a menace, it is a menace which\r\nis not felt till after the lapse of generations, a menace the fulfilment\r\nof which no single life is long enough to behold. For the State hires\r\nspecialists to fight, and specialists to keep order; indeed, the poorer\r\nthey are, the more cheaply it can obtain their services.[601] Its local\r\ngovernment is conducted mainly by specialised officials, and the\r\nconcentration of wealth makes possible a concentration of taxation. The\r\nextension of political power has been accompanied by a subdivision of\r\npolitical functions, which has diminished the importance of the\r\nindividual citizen, and turned him, as far as the routine of Government\r\nis concerned, into a sleeping partner, whose consent is necessary, but\r\nwhose active co-operation is superfluous.\r\n\r\n    [601] For the manner in which the British army is recruited by\r\n    starvation, see Mr. Cyril Jackson's Report on Boy Labour to the\r\n    Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress, Cd.\r\n    4632, pp. 166-168.\r\n\r\nNow we need not point out that this would be as fair a description of\r\nlarge classes of persons in the sixteenth century as it is now, and that\r\nthe day labourer and handicraftsman who \"are to be ruled and not to\r\nrule\"[602] were, as a class, far more completely beneath the\r\nconsideration of statesmen than they are at the present day. But we\r\nare concerned with the landholding population, not with the landless\r\nwage-earner, and in the slightly differentiated state of our period both\r\neconomic and political conditions made a decline in the standard of life\r\namong a class so important as the peasantry a danger which might cause\r\nthe most authoritarian of Governments to be confronted with very grave\r\npractical difficulties. It might find itself unable to raise an\r\neffective military force. The States of Continental Europe had\r\nintroduced standing armies. But England relied mainly on the shire\r\nlevies, and the shire levies were recruited from the small farmers. Just\r\nas the lord of a manor in the North of England, whose tenants held by\r\nborder service with horse and harness, was anxious to prevent the\r\ndecline in their numbers which landlords elsewhere were welcoming, so\r\nthe Government regarded with quite genuine dismay an agrarian movement\r\nwhich seemed to threaten its military resources by impoverishing the\r\nfinest fighting material in the country. Shadow, Feeble, and Wart may\r\n\"fill a pit as well as better\"; but to make good infantry it requires\r\nnot \"housed beggars,\" but \"men bred in some free and plentiful manner.\"\r\nOne Depopulation Statute after another recites how \"the defence of this\r\nland against our enemies outward is enfeebled and impaired.\"[603] In the\r\nsettlement of the North after the Pilgrimage of Grace the Government\r\ntook care to instruct its officials to see that the Northumbrian\r\ntenants, on whom the defence of the border depended, \"should be put in\r\ncomfort, that no more shall be exacted with gyrsums and like charges,\r\ninstead of which they shall be ready with horse and harness when\r\nrequired.\"[604] In 1601 Cecil[605] crushed a proposal to repeal the acts\r\nthen in force against depopulation by pointing out that the majority of\r\nthe militia levies were ploughmen. And in the instructions for the\r\nchoice of persons to be enrolled in the trained bands which were issued\r\nby the Government of Charles I., particular care was taken to\r\nemphasise that they were not to be selected at haphazard, but were to be\r\ndrawn from the families of the gentry, freeholders, and substantial\r\nfarmers.[606]\r\n\r\n    [602] Smith, _De Republica Anglorum_, Lib.

I am sure when warrants go from the Council for\r\n    levying of men in the counties, and the certificates be returned\r\n    unto us again, we find the greatest part of them to be\r\n    ploughmen.'\" See also on this point Appendix I., Nos. iv., v.,\r\n    vi., and viii.\r\n\r\n    [606] _Original Papers of the Norfolk and Norwich Archæological\r\n    Society_ (1909), p. 144.\r\n\r\nThis cogent reason for intervening to protect the peasantry was\r\nsupported by another which was not less convincing. The classes who\r\nsuffered most from enclosure were important from a fiscal, as well as a\r\nmilitary, point of view. In the simple economic life of that age the\r\nconnection between the output of wealth and the individual worker's\r\nopportunities for production and standard of subsistence, if not more\r\nimportant than to-day, was certainly more patent to observation. \"The\r\nhole welth of the body of the realm cometh out of the labours and works\r\nof the common peple ... a riche welthy body of a realm maketh a riche\r\nwelthy king, and a poore feble body of a realm must needs make a poore\r\nweak feble king.\"[607] In our period \"_pauvre paysans pauvre royaume,\r\npauvre royaume pauvre roi_\" was a statement not of any recondite theory,\r\nbut of an obvious economic fact, and one can hardly be mistaken in\r\nsupposing that part of the favour which sixteenth century Governments\r\nwere inclined to show the small farmer was due to the fact that the\r\nmethods of taxation in use made him important as a source of revenue. To\r\na State which relies largely for its supplies on a direct declaration of\r\nincome, it is indifferent whether the total assessable income is made up\r\nof a few large or many small ones; indeed if the tax be a progressive\r\none, most will be got from the former. But look at the way in which\r\ntaxation is raised in the sixteenth century. The chief direct tax is the\r\nsubsidy. A typical subsidy, for example that of the first year of\r\nElizabeth,[608] is assessed partly on the capital value of property,\r\nincluding farm and trade stock and household furniture, partly on the\r\nyearly profits of land. When a village of small and fairly prosperous\r\ncultivators is wiped out to make room for a large and sparsely populated\r\nestate, will the Government get as large a revenue from direct taxation\r\nas before? A modern reader may very well answer \"Yes.\" The motive of\r\nconverting land to pasture is to increase the profits of agriculture. If\r\nthey are increased, does not this mean a corresponding increase in the\r\ntaxable wealth of the country? Now to inquire how far one can assume in\r\nany age that the personal interests of landlords will lead to land being\r\nput to its most productive use would take us far beyond the scope of\r\nthis essay, and it is unnecessary for our present purpose. For, as far\r\nas our period is concerned, the answer is certainly wrong. Apart from\r\nthe subtler reactions of the agrarian changes upon social welfare, there\r\nis then no such identity between the economic interests of the landlord\r\nand the economic interests of the State. Speaking broadly, the former\r\nconsist in securing the largest net income, the latter in securing the\r\nlargest gross product. And these two things are by no means necessarily\r\nfound together. If a pasture farm managed by a shepherd and his dog is\r\nsubstituted by an enclosing proprietor for several score of families\r\nliving by tillage, the rent roll of the estate can hardly fail to be\r\nincreased, for the value of wool is so high, and the cost of\r\nsheep-farming so low, that the net income from which rent can be paid is\r\nlarge. But subsidies are assessed on property, not only on income; and\r\non personal as well as real property. A rise in rents is quite\r\ncompatible with a falling off in the gross produce of the land, and the\r\nconversion of an estate from arable to pasture, by displacing tenants,\r\nmeans a diminution in the farm stock and household property which has\r\nhitherto contributed towards the revenue.\r\n\r\n    [607] Pauli, _Drei volkswirthshaftliche Denkscriften_, How to\r\n    Reform the Realm in Setting Men to Work to restore Tillage: \"The\r\n    kynge and his lordes have nede to mynyster right ordre of common\r\n    wele; or els they must needs destroy their own wealth by the\r\n    very ordenaince of God, for they are upholden and borne upon the\r\n    body. Yf they will be riche, they must first see all common\r\n    people have riches.\"\r\n\r\n    [608] 1 Eliz. cap. xxi. Prothero Statutes and Constitutional\r\n    Documents, 1558-1625. Two subsidies of 1s. 8d. and 1s. were\r\n    imposed on \"every pound, as well in coin, ... as also plate,\r\n    stock of merchandises, all manner of corn and blades, household\r\n    stuff, and of all other goods moveable,\" and two subsidies of\r\n    2s. 8d. and 1s. 4d. on the \"yearly profits\" of land.\r\n\r\nLest such a view should seem unduly theoretical, let us hasten to add\r\nthat it is one which is endorsed by the authority of contemporaries.\r\nWhen subsidies are being debated in the House of Commons members\r\ncomplain that, while the wealthy are under-assessed, the small men pay\r\nmore than their share.[609] Political writers from Fortescue[610] to\r\nBacon[611] emphasise the fact that the ability of the country to bear\r\ntaxation depends on the maintenance of a high level of prosperity among\r\nthe yeomanry. The yeoman is a man who \"makes a whole line in the subsidy\r\nbook.\"[612] \"The weight thereof,\" says a pamphleteer in 1647, \"falls\r\nheavily ... especially upon the yeomanry.\"[613] The occasional glimpses\r\nwhich we get of harassed collectors trying in vain to screw taxes out of\r\nsmall farmers, whom a rise in rents or a bad season has plunged in\r\ndistress, show the truth of their accounts. In the reign of Edward VI.\r\nsubsidies cannot be collected on the northern border owing to the\r\noppression to which some of the tenants have been subjected.[614] From\r\nNorfolk in 1628 comes a still more melancholy tale. \"The ffarmors and\r\nsuch as use Husbandrye and tilth,\" write the Commissioners of the\r\nsubsidy to the Government, \"from whom in times past was accustomed to be\r\ndrawne the greatest part of ye money leviable by way of subsidye,\r\npresent unto us their pitiful estates, growen into decay through the\r\nbase price and noe vent in these later years for their corne ... that\r\nsome of them doo owe unto their landlordes two yeares rent, many of them\r\none years.... All which considered we much feare that the collectors\r\nshall not gather in the monye soe speedily as they would or we\r\ndesire.\"[615] The truth is that so much of the wealth of the country had\r\nbeen in the hands of the more prosperous among the small cultivators\r\nthat any decline in their position was likely to place the Governments\r\nof our period in financial straits. They regard it with the\r\nself-interested apprehension which modern statesmen feel lest capital\r\nshould be \"driven abroad.\" Hence there was a strong fiscal motive for\r\nprotecting the rural classes. Rebels who pointed out that \"A man can\r\nhave no more of a cat but the skin; that is the King can have no more of\r\nus than we have, which in a manner he has already,\"[616] or tenants who\r\nurged the Crown to protect them on the ground that \"they paie your\r\nMajesty subsidies, fifteens, and loans,\"[617] were using language which\r\nthe impecunious Government of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\ncould understand much better than appeals to humanitarian sentiment. The\r\nmilitary, financial, and political importance of the yeomanry was, in\r\nfact, great enough to make them one of the classes with whom the defence\r\nand order of the country were identified, and therefore sufficient to\r\nmake them an object of solicitude to statesmen who were concerned with\r\nnational interests.\r\n\r\n    [609] _D'Ewes' Journal_, p. 633. \"Sir Walter Raleigh said ...\r\n    'Call you this par iugum when a poor man pays as much as a rich,\r\n    and peradventure his estate is no better than he is set at, or\r\n    little better; when our estates, that be thirty or forty pounds\r\n    in the queen's books, are not the hundredth part of our\r\n    wealth?'\"\r\n\r\n    [610] Fortescue, _On the Governance of England_, chap. xii.:\r\n    \"The reaume off Ffraunce givith never ffrely off thair owne good\r\n    will any subsidie to thair prince, because the commons thereoff\r\n    be so pouere....

The\r\nswift agrarian changes of the sixteenth century differ from the swifter\r\nchanges of the eighteenth, in that enlightened opinion is, on the whole,\r\nagainst them, and that even the technical experts feel misgivings. If\r\nthe attitude of statesmen is to be explained by the practical reasons\r\nwhich have already been given, the opposition of men like More, Latimer,\r\nCrowley, Starkey, and Hales seemed to themselves a plain matter of\r\nmorals. In Germany Luther denounced the revolting peasants. In England\r\nthose who in ecclesiastical matters were poles apart united in a plea\r\nfor economic conservatism. Leading reformers preach and write against\r\nenclosing; and terrified landlords complain that \"none ever spake so\r\nvilely as these so-called commonwealths.\"[618] Their understanding of\r\nthe technique of the agrarian changes is often deficient. Like the\r\nCarlyles and Ruskins of a later age, they make Philistia merry with\r\ntheir sad blunders over economic details. But it would be a mistake to\r\nregard their views of the social effects of enclosing as abnormal or\r\nsentimental. They are the last great literary expression of the appeal\r\nto the average conscience which had been made by the old agrarian order,\r\nthe cry of a spirit which is departing, and which, in its agony, utters\r\nwords that are a shining light for all periods of change.\r\n\r\n    [618] Letter to Mr. Cecill from Sir Anthony Auchar, quoted by\r\n    Russell, _Ket's Rebellion, in Norfolk_, p. 202.\r\n\r\nSeveral paths of argument lead to their position. There is the\r\ntraditional importance of tillage. It is a \"foundation industry,\" an\r\nindustry from which four-fifths of the people directly or indirectly get\r\ntheir living. English Governments have always shown it special favour.\r\nIts maintenance is almost part of the common law[619] of the land. And\r\nit is right that it should be so. For the partition which separates men\r\nfrom starvation is thin, and if tillage fails how shall the people be\r\nfed? The Government insists on a certain minimum area being under the\r\nplough for exactly the same reason that the city of Coventry, when it is\r\nin the grip of a bad harvest, decides to break up part of its common\r\npastures for wheat. All men are agreed that the price of food ought to\r\nbe fixed by authority, and one cannot control prices unless one can\r\ncontrol supplies. There is the argument from social functions. The State\r\nis a community of classes. Between classes there must be inequality, for\r\neach has a different function, fighting, or merchandise, or handicraft,\r\nor husbandry. Unless there is inequality between classes no class can\r\nperform its duties or (strange thought) enjoy its rights. But one class\r\nmust not encroach upon the livelihood of another. If we will not have\r\nvillein blood on the Council, neither will we let gentlemen take into\r\ntheir hands the holdings of their tenants. For this means that one limb\r\nof the body politic drains nourishment from another limb, and that men\r\ndrop into a superfluous residuum from which the State gets no profit.\r\nAnd within a class there should be substantial equality. When one man\r\nhas the livelihoods of two must not another man go without any living at\r\nall? There is the argument from economic morality. In every bargain\r\nthere is the possibility of oppression. The unscrupulous man makes the\r\nmost of this. He regards only his own profit. He is \"a great taker of\r\nadvantages.\"[620] This is the sin of the usurer, the bodger, and the\r\ntyrannous landlord, and of this bad trinity the last is the worst. To\r\noppress men by rack-renting land is particularly detestable. For though\r\nin all contracts there is certainly (if only it can be found!) an\r\nobjective standard of value, yet a man may with reason be in doubt as to\r\nwhat is fair price to charge for an article the value of which has not\r\nbeen fixed by authority. But he can hardly be in doubt as to what is a\r\nfair rent. The fair rent is the usual rent; equity is custom. There is\r\nthe argument from the very nature of the bond between tenant and\r\nlandlord. Tenure is no longer as sacred a thing as once it was, and,\r\neven if it were, men who are legally the descendants of right-less\r\nvilleins could not easily appeal to its sanctity. But opinion feels that\r\nthere is something despicably sordid in using this particular relation\r\nas a financial engine. Though surveyors' economics are as notorious as\r\nlawyers' justice,[621] even one of that detested class can preface his\r\nbusiness-like account of western manors with words idealising the\r\nconditions which have \"knit such a knot of colaterall amytie between\r\nthe Lords and the tenants that the lord tendered his tenants as his\r\nchilde, and the tenants again loved the lord as naturally as the childe\r\nhis father.\"[622] The bond between landlord and tenant is perhaps,\r\nindeed, the only economic relationship which has ever yet stirred the\r\naffection of large masses of men. It has done so because it has been in\r\nthe past so much more than economic. The pitiful cry of that nameless\r\nold man to whose care Shakespeare commits the blinded Gloucester, \"O my\r\ngood lord, I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant, these\r\nfourscore years,\" is the voice of an attachment which once was real. In\r\nthe sixteenth century the tie of tenure is still the symbol of greater\r\nthings, and the wrench which is given it by the partial commercialising\r\nof agriculture seems to portend more ruinous innovations. Most men make\r\nthe State in the image of their own village, or city, or business. It is\r\nperhaps not an unfair description of one side of the social philosophy\r\nof our period to say that a manor is still a \"little commonwealth,\"[623]\r\nthe kingdom still the greatest of manors. If the lord holds from the\r\nKing, does not the tenant hold from his lord by as good a right? If the\r\ntenant who encroaches on his neighbour's strips is checked by the\r\nmanorial court, should not the lord who depopulates half a village be\r\nchecked by the King in his High Court of Parliament? If gentlemen\r\noppress yeomen, how can they \"live together as they be joined in one\r\nbody politic under the King?\"[624]\r\n\r\n    [619] Miss Leonard (_Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, New Series vol.\r\n    xix.) quotes Coke, _Institutes_, Book III., p. 105 (1644 ed.),\r\n    and _S. P. D. Chas. I._, clxxxvii., No. 95: \"The decay of\r\n    tillage and houses of husbandry are the undoubted causes and\r\n    grounds of depopulation, and a crime against the Common Laws of\r\n    this Realm, and every continuance thereof is a new crime.\" But\r\n    the words \"against the Common Laws\" are hardly to be interpreted\r\n    strictly.\r\n\r\n    [620] _S. P. D. Eliz._, vol. cclxxxvi., Nos. 19 and 20: \"He is a\r\n    great taker of advantages.

MSS. Com._, MSS. of Marquis\r\n    of Salisbury, Part II., 1575, Nov. 20. Lord North to the Bishop\r\n    of Ely: \"My lord, it wilbe no pleasure for you to have hir\r\n    Majestye and the Councell knowe howe wretchedly yowe live within\r\n    and without your house, howe extremely covetous, how great a\r\n    grazier, how marvellous a dayrye man, howe ritche a farmer, how\r\n    grete an owner.

Henry VIII._, xii., I., 98,\r\n    Instructions to the Duke of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nIt is true that it is just these ideas which in our period are on their\r\ntrial, and that if one were to seek the watershed where the mediæval\r\ntheory of land tenure, as something contingent on the fulfilment of\r\nobligations, parts company from modern conceptions of ownership, as\r\nconferring an unlimited right to unconditional disposal by the owner,\r\none would find it in the century and a half between 1500 and the final\r\nabolition of feudal tenures in 1660. The combination of forces both\r\neconomic and political making for a change of attitude is\r\nunmistakable; on the one hand the severance of the personal relationship\r\nof tenure through the development of the great leasehold farm, the\r\nbreaking up of the customary routine of cultivation through the\r\nincreasing dependence of agriculture on the market, the general revision\r\nof contracts brought about through the fall in the value of money; on\r\nthe other hand the enormous redistribution of landed property through\r\nthe confiscation of monastic and gild endowments, the consequent\r\ncreation of a new aristocracy ready to apply commercial ideas to land\r\ntenure, the desire of proprietors to escape from the obnoxious feudal\r\nincidents and of the Crown to find some more lucrative substitute for\r\nthem. But the decay of the older conceptions goes on very slowly. The\r\nGovernment is on the whole on the conservative side; for naturally it\r\nhas to work on the material to hand, and the best hope of maintaining\r\norder lies in the preservation of fixed customary relationships between\r\nthe different classes in society. Its instinct is therefore still to\r\ntreat the control and disposition of land as to a special degree a\r\nquestion of public policy, in regard to which landlords are bound\r\n\"rather to consider what is agreeable ... to the use of the state and\r\nfor the good of the commonwealth, than to seeke the utmost profit which\r\na landlord for his particular advantage may take among his\r\ntenants.\"[625]\r\n\r\n    [625] _Acts of the Privy Council_, New Series, vol. xxvii. p.\r\n    129. Letter from the Council to William Harman, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) _Legislation and Administration_\r\n\r\nThis was its instinct. But can we say more than this? Can we say that\r\nthe presumption in favour of protecting the small landholder was\r\ntranslated into any definite policy, and that such a policy was carried\r\nout in practice? The answer to these questions is by no means easily\r\ngiven. There is the difficulty of making any generalisation which will\r\ncover the century and a half during which, from time to time, the\r\nagrarian problem claimed public attention. True, this difficulty is not\r\nso serious as might at first sight appear, or as it would be in an age\r\nof swiftly changing ideas. The political historian may treat the Tudors\r\nas one period and the first two Stuarts as another. But the economist\r\nfinds much the same views on economic matters obtaining under Charles I.\r\nas under Henry VIII., and much the same administrative system to carry\r\nthem out. There is in our period no marked change in responsible opinion\r\nupon the enclosing movement. The Commission which deals with the subject\r\nin 1607 shows the same attitude as the Commission of 1517. Enclosers are\r\nfined in 1637 as they have been fined in the reign of James I. But the\r\nopinion which counts is not always responsible opinion. During the six\r\nyears which intervene between the death of Henry VIII. and the accession\r\nof Philip and Mary the Government is in the hands of the great\r\nlandlords,--landlords who have built up their fortunes out of the spoils\r\nof the monasteries, and whom no authority is strong enough to check. By\r\na curious chance the first head of the Government is a man who is an\r\nagrarian reformer by conviction. But, when he falls, his colleagues\r\nthrow over his policy, and turn savagely to the work of crushing out the\r\nvery possibility of organised protest among the peasantry. These years,\r\nthe so-called reign of Edward VI., will be an exception to whatever\r\nconclusions may be reached as to the policy of the State under the\r\nTudors and the first two Stuarts. Again, there is the difficulty, the\r\ngreat difficulty, of saying how far the interference of Governments is\r\nsuccessful even when they honestly desire it to have effect. The modern\r\nassumption, which is sometimes all too sanguine, is that a Law is being\r\ncarried out unless it is proved that it is not. For the sixteenth\r\ncentury there are those who would say that we must assume that a Law is\r\nnot being administered unless it is proved that it is, and, though\r\nscepticism is sometimes pushed to absurd lengths, one certainly cannot\r\nbuild much on the letter of Acts of Parliament. But how exacting are our\r\ntests of effective administration to be? All will agree that in our\r\nperiod the mere enacting of a Statute causes and cures very little,\r\nunless special efforts are applied to making it work. But is a\r\nperemptory order from the Council to the Justices of the Peace, or to\r\nthe Council of the North, to redress this or that grievance among\r\ntenants, a proof that the grievance will be redressed? Or must we be\r\ncontent with nothing less than a record of cases actually handled? If\r\nwe decline to believe in the efficacy of any economic legislation about\r\nwhich we have not a full list of decisions, we shall have little left to\r\nrely on. The famous Statute of Artificers will look shaky, and so will\r\nthe legislation with regard to prices and quality. Perhaps a reasonable\r\nview would be to look askance at mere Acts of Parliament, but to accept\r\naction, or orders to take action, on the part of the executive\r\nauthorities, as a proof that the law is being applied in practice.\r\n\r\nOf the Statutes prohibiting the conversion of arable to pasture we need\r\nnot, then, say much. The long series of Acts[626] which were passed\r\nbetween 1489 and 1597 show little originality. They were at bottom\r\nsimply a series of great manorial customaries framed to apply to the\r\nwhole country, or to all parts of the country which were not expressly\r\nexcepted from their operation, an attempt to maintain the _status quo_\r\nobtaining at any time by laying down for the whole country a common rule\r\nof cultivation of much the same kind as had been in the past maintained\r\nby local customs. They did not prohibit enclosure as such, but they\r\nproceeded on the assumption that a fixed proportion of the land, usually\r\nthe average of a certain number of years preceding the Act, ought to be\r\nunder the plough, and that the small cultivator's farm accommodation\r\nshould be maintained or renewed at the expense of the landlord. They\r\ndiffered only in the methods used to achieve this end. The Statutes\r\nbefore 1550 usually insisted merely on the reconversion of pasture land\r\nto tillage,[627] the re-edification of decayed houses of husbandry,[628]\r\nand the limitation to 2000 of the sheep to be kept by any one\r\nfarmer.[629] They relied on most unpromising machinery. Like the ancient\r\nStatute of Mortmain, they tried to make the feudal contract the means\r\nfor enforcing the law, by empowering superior lords to take half the\r\nprofits of mesne lords and tenants who infringed it. The Statutes after\r\n1550 were somewhat bolder in their experiments. The most important\r\ndeparture was the provision, first introduced into the Statutes of\r\n1552[630] and 1555,[631] for the creation of permanent bodies of\r\nCommissioners to do the work which, when most landlords were anxious to\r\nenclose, no landlord would undertake. Under the Statute of 1555,\r\nsubsequently declared \"too mild and gentle,\" but on the face of it a\r\ndrastic measure, the Commissioners were empowered both to bind over\r\noffenders to rebuild decayed houses, to plough up pasture land, and to\r\nfix the judicial rents which had been demanded by the peasantry and\r\nsuggested by certain reformers. It was repealed (together with the\r\nStatutes of 1536 and 1552) in 1563, the Act[632] of that year confirming\r\nthe earlier Acts passed in the reign of Henry VIII., and requiring all\r\nland which had been under the plough for four successive years since\r\n1529 to be kept in tillage, on pain of a fine of 10s. per acre for all\r\nland converted to pasture contrary to the Act. In 1589[633] a Statute\r\nwas passed for the protection of cottagers, prohibiting the letting of\r\ncottages to agricultural labourers with less than four acres of land\r\nattached. In 1593[634] it was thought that sufficient land was in\r\ntillage to make the maintenance of legislation on the subject\r\nunnecessary, and the clause in the Act of 1563, which forbade conversion\r\nto pasture, was repealed. But the result seems to have been a\r\nrecrudescence of the movement for converting arable land to pasture,\r\nwith the result that in 1597[635] two more Acts were passed, both of\r\nwhich adopted the expedient of setting up a special authority, apart\r\nfrom the ordinary machinery of local government, to enforce the Act, by\r\nempowering the Lord Chancellor to nominate bodies of Commissioners. The\r\nfirst enacted that all houses of husbandry decayed within seven years\r\npreceding the Act, and half of those decayed within seven years before\r\nthat, were to be rebuilt and let, the former with not less than 40\r\nacres, and the latter with not less than 20 acres, of land. It also took\r\nthe significant step of expressly sanctioning the consolidation of\r\nintermixed holdings by way of exchange between lord and tenants, or\r\nbetween one tenant and another. The second applied only to twenty-five\r\ncounties, where, presumably, enclosing had proceeded furthest or was\r\nmost disastrous in its effects. It enacted that all land converted from\r\ntillage to pasture since 1558 should be reconverted within three years,\r\nif it had been under the plough for twelve years immediately preceding\r\nconversion, and that land which had been in tillage for twelve years\r\npreceding the Act should remain in tillage, the penalty for disobedience\r\nbeing a fine of 20s. per acre. These two Acts escaped the general repeal\r\nof the laws against depopulation which took place in 1624, and remained\r\non the Statute Book till the Statute Law Revision Act of 1863.\r\n\r\n    [626] A useful list of these Acts, with a summary of their\r\n    provisions, is given by Slater, _The English Peasantry and the\r\n    Enclosure of Common Fields_, Appendix D.\r\n\r\n    [627] 4 Henry VII., c. 19. All occupiers of twenty acres and\r\n    more which have been in tillage during three years preceding the\r\n    Act to maintain tillage.\r\n\r\n    [628] 6 Henry VIII., c. 5, and 7 Henry VIII., c. 1. In parishes\r\n    \"whereof the more part was or were used and occupied to tillage\r\n    and husbandry,\" any person who \"shall decay a town, a hamlet, a\r\n    house of husbandry, or convert tillage into pasture,\" and has\r\n    not \"within one yeere next after such wylfull decaye reedifyed\r\n    and made ageyn mete and convenyent for people to dwell and\r\n    inhabyte the same ... and therein to exercyse husbandry and\r\n    tillage,\" forfeits one half of his land to the lord of the\r\n    manor. Land converted to pasture must be tilled \"after the maner\r\n    and usage of the countrey where the seyd land lyeth.\"\r\n\r\n    [629] 25 Henry VIII., c. 13.\r\n\r\n    [630] 5 and 6 Edward VI., c. 5.\r\n\r\n    [631] 2 and 3 Philip and Mary, c. 2.\r\n\r\n    [632] 5 Elizabeth, c. 2.\r\n\r\n    [633] 31 Elizabeth, c. 7.\r\n\r\n    [634] 35 Elizabeth, c. 7.\r\n\r\n    [635] 39 Elizabeth, c. 1 and c. 2.\r\n\r\nThe Statutes are evidence of a state of opinion. To judge how far that\r\nopinion wrote itself on the world of affairs we must look elsewhere. Nor\r\nare they in themselves very interesting. The genius of sixteenth century\r\nstatesmanship lay in administration not in legislation. It dwelt not in\r\nParliament but in the Council, and in those administrative courts, the\r\nCourt of Star Chamber, the Court of Requests, the Council of the North,\r\nthe Council of Wales, which were the Privy Council's organs. In studying\r\neconomic questions in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, one\r\nis met at every turn by the apparatus of special administrative\r\njurisdictions, which was built up by the Tudors, and which fell to\r\npieces with the final rupture between the Crown and Parliament. On the\r\none hand, they supply the control and stimulus in matters of detailed\r\nadministration, without which all legislation designed to regulate\r\nshifting economic relationships, or running counter to the prejudices of\r\na powerful class, is doomed to be ineffective. Are the Justices of the\r\nPeace lax in carrying out the Statutes for the relief of the poor and\r\npunishment of vagrants? The Council will remonstrate. Have they omitted\r\nto assess wages and fix prices? The Council will let them know that\r\ntheir neglect has been noted at headquarters and that it must be\r\ncorrected. Are capitalists in the clothing counties dismissing workmen\r\nin times of trade depression? The Council will direct the justices to\r\nread them a lesson on the duty of employers to their operatives and to\r\nthe State, and threaten them with a summons to Whitehall unless they\r\nmend their ways. A stream of correspondence pours into London from the\r\nGovernment's agents in the counties--returns as to the supplies of wheat\r\navailable for consumption, applications for permission to license the\r\nexport of food-stuffs, statistics as to prices, information as to\r\nunemployment, information as to vagrancy based on a \"day-count\" of\r\nvagabonds. The Council digests it, and sends out its mandates to\r\ncontinue this and alter that, to raise wages or reduce prices, to\r\ninspect granaries, punish middlemen, whip sturdy rogues, relieve the\r\npoor. Bad means of communication, scanty and inaccurate intelligence,\r\nincompetent local officials, prevent administration from running\r\nsmoothly; and as the Civil War approaches incompetence becomes\r\nrecalcitrance. Nevertheless the engine is a powerful one, and up to a\r\nyear or two before the meeting of the Long Parliament its throb is felt\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\nSuch a system of centralised supervision, which can meet emergencies\r\nwith promptitude, and can adjust regulations to the varying needs of\r\ndifferent years and different localities, is a necessity in any society\r\nwhere economic relationships are made the object of authoritative\r\ncontrol. Under the Tudors and first two Stuarts the Council does much\r\nthat is done to-day by several State departments--the Board of\r\nAgriculture and Fisheries, the Board of Education, the Local Government\r\nBoard, the Home Office, as well as much that is left to Private Bill\r\nlegislation. But the Council is, of course, much more than an executive\r\norgan. It is also a court of law. It does not only make rules, it\r\npunishes people for breaking them. Sometimes it exercises jurisdiction\r\nitself. More often, at any rate in the cases arising out of the economic\r\nquestions with which we are chiefly concerned, it issues an order, and\r\nleaves the punishment of breaches of it to the Court of Star Chamber and\r\nthe Court of Requests. Into the controversy as to the constitutional\r\nposition of these courts we need not enter; we need only point out their\r\nextreme importance as buttresses of the Government's control over\r\neconomic affairs. Both in personnel and procedure they were admirably\r\nqualified to be the instruments of a thorough system of State\r\nintervention in matters of industry and agriculture. Both of them were\r\ncommittees of the Council, and in both the governmental predominated\r\nover the judicial element, the two judges who attended the Court of Star\r\nChamber, and the Masters of Requests who sat in the Court of Requests,\r\nbeing in the position rather of legal advisers or assessors than of\r\njudicial authorities. In theory the former court dealt with criminal,\r\nthe latter with civil cases. But in an age when the majority of the\r\npopulace were armed, a dispute was extremely likely to terminate in a\r\nriot, and in practice there were subjects on which complaints came\r\nbefore either court indifferently. They dispensed with a jury. They took\r\naccount of equitable considerations which had no place in the common law\r\ncourts. They were guided by reasons of State, not by the letter of the\r\nlaw, and would punish behaviour as contrary to public policy. For the\r\nexecution of their rulings they used not only the ordinary officers of\r\nthe law, the Justices of the Peace, but also special bodies of\r\nCommissioners.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the abuses of this system of administrative\r\njurisdictions, one can easily understand that it was well fitted to deal\r\nwith the agrarian problem. It is seen at its worst in ecclesiastical\r\nmatters. It is seen at its best in protecting the poorer classes against\r\neconomic tyranny; and we shall fail to understand the popularity of the\r\nTudor Governments unless we lay as much emphasis on the good side as on\r\nthe bad. The Court of Requests in particular is a popular court, a court\r\nwhich punishes the rich, a court which brings, in the words of the\r\naristocratic chronicler, \"many an honest man to trouble and vexacion,\" a\r\ncourt to which the poor \"compleyned without number.\"[636] The notorious\r\ndifficulty of getting a verdict from a jury of tenants who are liable\r\nto eviction means that a landlord can break the law with impunity. Here\r\nare courts before which the intimidator can be intimidated; courts which\r\nwill handle him \"on that sort, that what courage soever he hath, his\r\nheart will fall to the grounde.\"[637] The enormous importance of\r\nmanorial custom in determining the fate of all classes of peasants,\r\nexcept the freeholders, makes it certain that grave injustice will be\r\ndone to vested interests by any court which confines itself to the\r\nstrict letter of the law. The Council will direct that \"such order be\r\ntaken in the matter as in justyce and equitie shall appertayn.\"[638] The\r\nmere fact that its ruling is not simply the verdict of a court but the\r\ncommand of the Government, increases the probability that it will\r\nreceive due attention from those whose duty it is to enforce it. The\r\nlandlord who has enclosed may be the very man who hears the peasant's\r\ncomplaint. The Council will interfere to insist on the local authorities\r\ntaking \"a more indifferent course.\"[639]\r\n\r\n    [636] Hall's _Chronicle of Henry VIII._, p. 585 (Edition 1809),\r\n    quoted by Leadam, introduction to _Select Cases in the Court of\r\n    Requests_ (Selden Society).\r\n\r\n    [637] Smith, _De Republica Anglorum_, Lib.

A letter to the Council in the Marches of Wales,\r\n    concerning the tenants of Aston in Montgomeryshire: \"And if it\r\n    be true, as they do inform us by their petitions, that\r\n    examinations in a case concerning one of that Counsell should be\r\n    taken by a kinsman of his owne and a clerk underneathe him, wee\r\n    wyshe ... that you would have taken a more indifferent course,\r\n    especially in a matter of commons, which, concerning many\r\n    persons, doth easily give occasion of offence and scandal.\"\r\n\r\nThe activity of the Government in matters of land was not so incessant\r\nas it was in the regulation of prices and the administration of the Poor\r\nLaws; for its land policy was strongly opposed to the interests of the\r\ncountry gentry who were its officials, and it had to proceed with\r\ncaution. If we except the first great Commission appointed by Wolsey in\r\n1517, the periods in which it was especially energetic in dealing with\r\nthe land question were three, the years between 1536 and 1549, the years\r\nfrom 1607 to 1618, the years from 1630 to 1636; and on each of these\r\nthree occasions there was some temporary cause to explain its peculiar\r\nzeal--on the two first the revolts of the peasantry, and on the last the\r\nrise in the price of grain, which suggested that an unduly small\r\nproportion of the land was under tillage. Nevertheless it handles\r\nindividual cases with considerable frequency throughout the whole\r\nperiod from 1517 to 1640. Usually it acts as a final court of appeal,\r\nwhich intervenes only when other means of redress have broken down, and\r\nit is sometimes at pains to explain to offended landlords that it does\r\nnot intend to debar them from asserting their rights at Common Law, if\r\nthey can. Its aim is to stop very gross cases of oppression, to prevent\r\nthe peasants being made the victims of legal chicanery and intimidation,\r\nto induce landlords to take a larger view of their responsibilities, to\r\nsettle disputes by the use of common sense and moral pressure. It steps\r\nin when the tenants are poor men who are being ruined by vexatious\r\nlawsuits, or when enclosure is thought likely to produce disorder, or to\r\nforbid a landlord to take action pending a decision by the courts. It\r\nhas to hear many cases touching copyholders and many touching commons;\r\nfor no one is quite certain as to the legal rights of copyholders, and\r\nin the matter of commons there is a fearful gulf between law and equity.\r\nOccasionally in the reign of Henry VIII., and even in that of Elizabeth,\r\nit deals with cases of villeinage. But these, though more numerous than\r\nmight have been supposed, are nevertheless rare, for the principal\r\neconomic evils of the period consist not in the revival of old claims,\r\nbut in the new competitive conditions of agriculture. The treatment of\r\nthe latter is by no means a simple matter--even the strong Governments\r\nof Henry VIII. and Elizabeth will not lightly thrust forceful fingers\r\ninto the mysterious custom-bound recesses of the manor--and when we have\r\nsaid that on the whole the bias of the Tudor and early Stuart statesmen\r\nis against revolutionary changes that damage the peasants, we can say\r\nlittle more without citing individual cases of interference.\r\n\r\nLet us look shortly at the more striking among them. The famous\r\nCommission upon enclosure appointed by Wolsey in 1517 set a precedent to\r\nbe followed in several subsequent inquiries, and has left us an\r\ninvaluable body of information as to the nature and extent of the\r\nenclosing movement. It was, however, by no means the first example of\r\nthe Government intervening in the agrarian problem, and the partial\r\nreconversion of pasture to arable, which seems to have resulted from\r\nits labours, still left an urgent need for a continuous supervision of\r\nthe relations between landlord and tenant by some tribunal sufficiently\r\nindependent to do justice to the weaker party. In 1494 the earliest\r\nproceedings in the interminable case[640] of John Mulsho v. the\r\ninhabitants of Thingden ended in the Court of Star Chamber (the same\r\ncourt was dealing with the same matter in 1538) with a decree in favour\r\nof the tenants. In 1510 the same body was dealing with a quarrel between\r\nthe Abbot and the copyholders of Peterborough,[641] and in 1516 with a\r\ncomplaint from the inhabitants of Draycote[642] and Stoke Gifford that\r\nthe lord of the manor had evicted copyholders, stopped up rights of way,\r\nand enclosed common land. The policy of Wolsey is sufficiently indicated\r\nby the active campaign which he set on foot against depopulation, and\r\nrequires no further illustration. But it is interesting to observe that\r\nhis attitude towards the agrarian question was not a mere personal\r\nidiosyncrasy, and that it was the same in all essential particulars as\r\nthat of his successor. Thomas Cromwell must bear the blame for part of\r\nthe agrarian distress which prevailed during the closing years of Henry\r\nVIII. and the reign of Edward VI.; for that distress was enhanced by the\r\nwild land speculation which followed the secularisation of the monastic\r\nestates. In that age, however, such indirect social reactions of their\r\npolicy were matters quite beneath the consideration of statesmen, and\r\nthe fact that the Government was responsible for changes which operated\r\nmost disastrously on the established order of rural society did not\r\nprevent administrative interference to impede agrarian innovations from\r\ngoing on to the end of the reign of Henry VIII. Indeed the King,\r\ninfluenced no doubt by the fear that agrarian agitation might add fuel\r\nto religious discontent, seems himself to have taken some interest in\r\nthe matter. In 1534 one finds Cromwell writing to congratulate him on\r\nthe passage through the House of Commons of a Bill providing that no man\r\nshall keep more than 2000 sheep, and that one-eighth of every farmer's\r\nland shall always remain in tillage, \"The most profitable and most\r\nbenefycyall thing that ever was done to this the commonwealthe of your\r\nrealm;\"[643] and in the following year there is a letter[644] from\r\nCromwell to Rich directing him to apprise the Duke of Suffolk of the\r\nKing's displeasure at the decay of certain towns which the Duke had\r\npromised to repair. The agrarian grievances expressed in the Pilgrimage\r\nof Grace were admitted, and in the instructions issued to the officers\r\nwho were appointed to restore order in the disaffected counties special\r\ndirections[645] were included to throw open enclosures, and to reduce\r\nthe excessive fines charged to tenants on admission to their holdings.\r\nIn the years immediately following the same policy was pursued in other\r\nparts of the country. In 1538 the Earl of Derby[646] writes to Cromwell\r\nprotesting against the pressure put upon him to reinstate seven tenants\r\nwhom he has turned out. In 1540 a landlord[647] in the Isle of Wight is\r\ncompelled to restore to their holdings some recently evicted tenants. In\r\n1541 several cases come before the Council. It appoints a Commission to\r\ninvestigate the case of a Northamptonshire[648] landlord who has\r\nprevented the tenants of Brigstock from feeding their pigs, calves, and\r\nsheep, by cutting up part of a common wood \"into several pastures for\r\nhis own private use and benefit.\" It meets a complaint from the\r\nborderers[649] of the Forest of Dartmoor that the owner of the lands of\r\nthe monastery of Buckfast is breaking the statute which required the\r\nlands of dissolved abbeys to be farmed in the traditional way, by\r\nexcluding them from the common, with a decision upholding the tenants'\r\ncase and with the appointment of Commissioners to carry out the award.\r\nIt sets a certain choleric Sir Nicholas Poyntz,[650] who has dared to\r\nprocure the imprisonment of a tenant for proceeding against him before\r\nthe Council, to cool his temper in the Fleet, and when he comes out\r\ncompels him to grant his victim a new farm in exchange for one which he\r\nhas surrendered, to reduce his rent from 20s. to 6s., and to pay him\r\nforty marks as compensation for his \"damages and travailles.\" In\r\n1543[651] the tenants of Abbots Ripton lay a complaint in the Court of\r\nRequests against Sir John St. John on the ground that, in addition to\r\nother acts of oppression, he has entered forcibly on their holdings. Sir\r\nJohn replies that they are not copyholders, but merely tenants at will,\r\nwho are unprotected by any immemorial custom, and after an examination\r\nof the manor rolls the court holds that he is right. But the legal\r\ninsecurity of the tenants does not prevent them from getting protection.\r\nThe court requires their landlord to grant them leases for years at\r\nreasonable rents, and orders that the property which he has distrained\r\nshall be restored.\r\n\r\n    [640] Selden Society, _Select Cases in the Court of Star\r\n    Chamber_, edited by Leadam, and Leadam, E.

There was a large difference\r\nbetween using the jurisdiction of the Council to redress individual\r\ncases of hardship and a deliberate attempt to effect a general\r\nsettlement of the land question upon lines which would do substantial\r\njustice to the peasants. The former course involved no perilous\r\nassertion of principles, and could be pursued under the guise of a\r\npurely conservative policy, merely by referring disputes between\r\nlandlords and tenants to the Courts of Star Chamber and Requests, which,\r\nthough in fact administrative and governmental bodies, were none the\r\nless protected to some extent against criticism by wearing the\r\nappearance of mere legal tribunals. The latter might, perhaps, have been\r\nattempted with some faint hope of success, if statesmen had been much\r\nmore careful than they were to discriminate between the different\r\naspects of the problem with which they were confronted. To us, who look\r\nback on the situation from a distance of three and a half centuries,\r\nit seems that the one guiding thread, which might have led some way\r\nthrough the welter of confusion, was offered by the sharp distinction\r\ndrawn by Hales between those enclosures which were made by the exchange\r\nand consolidation of strips, with a view to better husbandry, and those\r\nwhich had as their effect the conversion of arable land to pasture, the\r\nmonopolising of commons, and the eviction of tenants. The arguments in\r\nfavour of the first type of enclosure were too cogent for any policy\r\nwhich condemned enclosing in general to have the smallest prospect of\r\nsuccess. The only possibility of averting the ruin to the peasantry\r\nwhich accompanied depopulation lay in encouraging them generally to\r\nfollow the example of their brothers in Kent, Essex, Devonshire, and\r\nCornwall, who had for centuries been substituting a more progressive\r\nhusbandry for the \"mingle mangle\" of the open fields, without the\r\ndisastrous consequences entailed by the spread of capitalist agriculture\r\nin other parts of the South and Midlands. But such a frank encouragement\r\nof certain kinds of enclosure for the sake of repressing others implied\r\nan appreciation of the economics of the problem to which comparatively\r\nfew persons in our period had attained, and was quite beyond the grasp\r\nof Governments, which, at their worst, as under Warwick, were quite\r\nindifferent to the sufferings of the poorer classes, and, at their best,\r\nconceived public interests to be served best by a strict maintenance of\r\ncustomary conditions. Somerset's policy of deliberately restoring\r\nancient relationships with a strong hand could hardly even be begun\r\nwithout those who pursued it taking sides in a bitter economic\r\nagitation, and essaying openly to reverse the whole agrarian movement\r\nwith which, in the course of the past half century, the wealth of the\r\nmiddle and upper classes, at any rate south of the Trent, had become\r\ninextricably identified. It involved in fact a return to the policy of\r\nWolsey, and a return to it under conditions which made Wolsey's policy\r\ndoubly hard to carry out, inasmuch as, on the one hand, the position of\r\nSomerset as temporary head of a jealous aristocracy was far weaker than\r\nthat of the omnipotent Cardinal, and, on the other hand, the lapse of\r\ntwenty years had seen the growth of a generation to which enclosures\r\nwere a vested interest.\r\n\r\nYet it would be a mistake to think of the whole agrarian episode between\r\nthe death of Henry VIII. and the fall of Somerset as the mere freak of a\r\nmisguided doctrinaire. If we can see difficulties which he did not, if\r\nwe can smile at the thought of any Government at once so incompetent,\r\nand but for Somerset himself, so entirely selfish, carrying out a great\r\nconservative revolution in the teeth of the new wealth and power of the\r\ncountry, we must also remember that he was not alone in thinking the\r\nspoliation of the weaker rural classes not only, as it certainly was,\r\nillegal, but also so patently unjust as to amount to a national crime,\r\nand that in that age men overestimated the ability of a Government fiat\r\nto modify economic habits almost as much as they underestimated it two\r\nand a half centuries later. Somerset can hardly have been ignorant of\r\nthe tremendous risks involved in his policy. But he may well have\r\nthought inaction not only baser than, but almost as dangerous as,\r\naction. It was certain that, unless the Government interfered to protect\r\ntenants, there would be a series of peasants' revolts. The best answer\r\nto the charge of stirring up class hatred, which was made against\r\nSomerset, as against all who call attention to its causes, was that\r\nagrarian rioting had begun in Hertfordshire[652] before the Commission\r\non Enclosures was sent out, that in those counties where it took its\r\nwork seriously order was maintained till the end of 1548, and that grave\r\ndisturbances did not take place until the following year, when it became\r\nevident that, both in Parliament and on the Council, the Protector's\r\npolicy had been beaten by the opposition of the great landowners. Nor is\r\nthere any reason to doubt the sincerity of Somerset himself (though he,\r\nlike every one else, had speculated in monastic estates), however much\r\nthere may be to regret that his policy did not come into stronger hands,\r\nor fall upon times which were, from a political point of view, less\r\nhopelessly impracticable. An attempt was made to set a good example on\r\nthe Crown Estates. In 1548, in response to complaints from the tenants\r\nat Walton, Weybridge, Esher, and Shepperton, that the making of the\r\nroyal deer park at Hampton Court was ruining them through the loss of\r\ncommon rights which it entailed, an order[653] was issued dechasing the\r\nPark, and throwing open the enclosed lands to the commoners. In the\r\nfollowing year Somerset secured the passage through Parliament of a\r\nPrivate Act[654] conferring a good title on those copyholders on his own\r\nmanors to whom demesne lands had been let, and who, as occupiers of\r\nother than customary tenancies, could not claim the protection of\r\nmanorial custom. It is plain from the comparatively few complaints which\r\ncame in the sixteenth century from freeholders that, if such a course\r\nhad been generally pursued, the chief objection to the changes grouped\r\ntogether under the name of enclosure would have been removed, because\r\nthe harsh disturbance of vested interests which they involved would have\r\nbeen avoided. But that, of course, was quite outside the bounds of\r\npolitical possibility.\r\n\r\n    [652] Appendix to Miss Lamond's edition of _The Commonweal of\r\n    this Realm of England_, Hale's defence, p. lviii.: \"Whas ther\r\n    not, longe before this Commyssyon was sent forthe, an\r\n    insurrection in Hertfordshire for the comens at Northall and\r\n    Cheshunt?\"\r\n\r\n    [653] _Acts of the Privy Council_, New Series, vol. ii. pp.\r\n    190-193, May 5, 1548: a complaint from \"many poor men of the\r\n    Parishes of Walton, Weybridge, East Molson, West Molson,\r\n    Caverham, Esher, Byfiete, Temsditton ... in the name of the\r\n    whole parishes before rehearsed, that by reason of the making of\r\n    the late chase of Hampton Court, forsomyche as their commons,\r\n    pastures, and meadows be taken in, and that all the said\r\n    parishes are overlaid with the deer now increasing daily upon\r\n    them, very many households of the same parishes be let fall\r\n    down, the families decayed, and the king's liege people much\r\n    diminished, the country thereabout in manner made desolate.\"\r\n\r\n    [654] See p. 294.\r\n\r\nThe story of Somerset's attempt to deal with the land question is soon\r\ntold. In 1548 agrarian discontent was at its height. Some time in that\r\nyear there must have come to the hands of the Government the small tract\r\non the effect of sheep-farming in Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire,\r\nBuckinghamshire, and Berkshire, which was printed in 1551 under the name\r\nof \"Certayne causes of the Present Discontent.\"[655] In spring and\r\nsummer Latimer was thundering against the \"Step-lords\"[656] at Paul's\r\nCross. In autumn Crowley published his \"Information and Petition\r\nagainst the Oppressors of the Poor Commons.\"[657] Above all, the poor\r\ncommons had earlier in the year shown unmistakable signs of fending for\r\nthemselves. The result of Somerset's own sympathy with the prevalent\r\ndiscontent was the formation of something like a party, under the name\r\nof the \"Commonwealth men,\" with Latimer as its prophet and Hales as its\r\nman of action, which had a programme sufficiently definite to put heart\r\ninto the peasantry and to terrify the great landed proprietors. On June\r\n1st a Royal Commission[658] was appointed to inquire into offences\r\ncommitted against the Acts forbidding conversion of arable to pasture\r\nand depopulation. The Commission divided itself into several committees\r\nto deal with different parts of the country. Only one of them, however,\r\nconsisting of John Hales and five of his colleagues, got seriously to\r\nwork. It had a large area to cover--the counties of Oxfordshire,\r\nBerkshire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire,\r\nand Northamptonshire--and one which was the centre of the agitation\r\nagainst enclosure. It seems to have interrupted its labours during\r\nautumn and winter, but it was busy in June, July, and August 1548, and\r\nagain in the summer of 1549, by which time, however, the anger of the\r\nlanded gentry against its proceedings, and of the peasants against the\r\ninactivity of the Commission as a whole, had reached a point which made\r\nit hardly possible for it to do more than collect information.\r\nConsidering the difficulties of its task, and the wide tract of country\r\nto be covered, its behaviour appears to have been thorough and\r\nbusiness-like. The usual procedure was to empanel a jury of twelve in\r\neach place visited, to whom Hales delivered an address explaining the\r\nobjects and methods of the inquiry, as set out in the instructions\r\nissued by the Government to the Commissioners. These stated the\r\nCommission to have been formed in particular \"for the maintenance and\r\nkeeping up of houses of husbandry, for avoiding destruction and pulling\r\ndown of houses for enclosures and converting of arable land into\r\npasture, for limiting what number of sheep men should have and keep in\r\ntheir possession at one time, against plurality and keeping together of\r\nfarms, and for maintenance of housekeeping, hospitality, and tillage on\r\nthe sites ... of such monasteries, priories, and religious houses as\r\nwere dissolved.\"[659] Offenders were then presented by the jury, and\r\nthough, on Hales' advice, a pardon was granted them for their past\r\nillegalities, their enclosures seem to have been thrown down, arable\r\nwhich had been turned into pasture to have been ploughed up, and farms\r\nwhich had been united to have been separated.[660]\r\n\r\n    [655] Published by the E. E. T. S.\r\n\r\n    [656] The first sermon preached before King Edward the Sixth,\r\n    March 8, 1549: \"You landlords, you rent-raisers, I may say you\r\n    step-lords, you unnatural lords, you have for your possession\r\n    yearly too much. For that herebefore went for twenty or forty\r\n    pounds by year ... now is let for fifty or an hundred pound by\r\n    year.\" See also Latimer, _The Sermon of the Plough_, January 18,\r\n    1548.\r\n\r\n    [657] Strype, _Ecclesiastical Memorials_.\r\n\r\n    [658] The proclamation appointing the Commission is printed by\r\n    Strype, _op. cit._, vol. ii., Book I., chap. ii. The operative\r\n    part of it runs: \"And therefore, He ... hath appointed,\r\n    according to the said acts and proclamations, a view and inquiry\r\n    to be made of all such as contrary to the said acts and godly\r\n    ordinances have made enclosures and pasture of that which was\r\n    arable ground, or let any house, tenement, or mease decay or\r\n    fall down, or done anything contrary of the good and wholesome\r\n    articles contained in the said acts.\" In my account of the\r\n    situation under Somerset I have followed the documents printed\r\n    by Strype, and the appendix to Miss Lamond's introduction to\r\n    _The Commonweal of this Realm of England_.\r\n\r\n    [659] Strype, _Ecclesiastical Memorials_.\r\n\r\n    [660] For the pardon, see appendix to Miss Lamond's introduction\r\n    to _The Commonweal_, &c., p. lxi.; for the ploughing up of a\r\n    park and division of farms, _ibid._, pp. xli. and lxi.-lxii.;\r\n    for the Bills introduced by Hales, _ibid._, xl., xlv.-lii.,\r\n    lxii.-lxv. Strype's account appears to be based on that of\r\n    Hales.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Somerset kept the general policy of agrarian reform\r\nalive on the Council. In the autumn of 1548 Hales had returned to\r\nLondon, and, as member for Preston, had prepared three Bills, dealing\r\npartly with enclosures and partly with the high prices. The first,\r\nrequiring re-edification of decayed houses and the maintenance of\r\ntillage, and the second, forbidding speculation in food-stuffs, were\r\nintroduced into the House of Lords. The third, which aimed at\r\nencouraging cattle breeding as distinct from sheep grazing, was read\r\nfirst in the House of Commons. Neither Bill came to anything, for\r\nParliament was as angry as the Council with Somerset's policy. But in\r\nMay 1549 the Protector issued another proclamation against the decay of\r\nhouses and enclosure; in June he infuriated the upper classes by a\r\nproclamation pardoning persons who had taken the law into their own\r\nhands by pulling down hedges; and throughout the whole period of his\r\npower he used the Court of Requests as an instrument for protecting\r\ntenants against landlords.[661] The Secretary[662] to the Council, who\r\nwas quite ready for a reign of terror provided that the gentry began it,\r\nprophesied gloomily that the German peasants' revolt was to be\r\nre-enacted in England, and Warwick attacked Hales fiercely for venturing\r\nto discharge the duties laid upon him by the Government, of which\r\nWarwick was a member.[663] \"Sir,\" wrote a plaintive Norfolk gentleman to\r\nCecil about the time of Ket's rebellion, \"Be plain with my Lord's Grace,\r\nthat under the pretence of simplicity and poverty there may not rest\r\nmuch mischief. So do I fear there doth in these men called Commonwealths\r\nand their adherents. To declare unto you the state of the gentlemen (I\r\nmean as well the greatest as the lowest) I assure you they are in such\r\ndoubt that almost they dare touch none of them, but for that some of\r\nthem have been sent up and come away without punishment, and that\r\nCommonwealth called Latimer hath gotten the pardon of others.... I may\r\nwell gather some of them to be in jealousy of my Lord's friendship, yea\r\nand to be plain, think my Lord's grace rather to will the decay of the\r\ngentlemen than otherwise.\"[664] Poor gentlemen! A Government which holds\r\nthat laws do not exist only to preserve the rich in their possessions!\r\nTruly the mountains are removed.\r\n\r\n    [661] For these facts, see Strype, _Ecclesiastical Memorials_.\r\n\r\n    [662] Strype, _Ecclesiastical Memorials_.

But it was thought nothing\r\n    and might easily be appeased, and also some spiced consciences\r\n    taking pity of the poor ... thought it a sore matter to lose so\r\n    many of their country folk, saying they were simple folk.... It\r\n    cost, ere it was appeased, they say, 1000 or 2000 men.\"\r\n\r\n    [663] Appendix to Miss Lamond's introduction to _The\r\n    Commonweal_, &c., pp. xli. and lii. But of course there was no\r\n    such thing as collective responsibility for policy in the\r\n    sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n    [664] Russel, _Ket's Rebellion in Norfolk_, p. 202.\r\n\r\nSomerset's Government had too short a life for us to judge how far, in\r\nhappier political circumstances, he might have succeeded, not in\r\nchecking agrarian changes, which would in any case have been impossible,\r\nbut in securing that reasonable consideration should be given to the\r\nvested interests of the poorer classes. As Elizabethan statesmen\r\ndiscovered[665] at the end of the century, there was room for a policy\r\nwhich would prevent the wholesale displacement of tenants, and\r\nnevertheless offer an encouragement to the formation of the compact\r\nholdings out of the scattered strips and common pastures, which the\r\nagricultural experts were unanimous in condemning. There are faint\r\nindications of an understanding that a fair middle course was possible\r\nin a remarkable case which comes from the little Huntingdonshire town of\r\nGodmanchester.[666] At Godmanchester there had been the usual changes of\r\nthe preceding half century. Rents had been raised, cottages pulled down,\r\nwoods destroyed and turned to pasture, while the meadows, which under\r\nthe Act of 1547 had been confiscated from the local gild, offered a\r\ntempting prey to some enterprising speculator. On complaints coming\r\nbefore the Council in the summer of 1549 a comprehensive scheme of\r\nreorganisation was drawn up. All persons with more than one house were\r\nto let at the customary rent that which they did not use themselves. All\r\npersons who had pulled down houses or converted them to other purposes\r\nthan the accommodation of tenants were either to rebuild them or to\r\nbuild new ones, and to let them to any one offering the customary rent\r\nbefore Michaelmas 1549. The groves of wood converted to pasture were to\r\nbe enclosed, so as to prevent the depredations made upon them by\r\nstraying beasts, and, if necessary, the land was to be sown with acorns.\r\nWith the gild lands a course was taken which, in the scramble for land\r\nwhich was going on in the middle of the sixteenth century, was\r\nunfortunately highly unusual. According to the Council's directions they\r\nwere to \"be divided among the inhabitants thereof in this manner; that\r\nis to say to every ploughland five acres, and to every cottager and\r\nartificer there dwelling, or which hereafter upon the houses to be now\r\nbuilded shall dwell, one acre, and, if the number do not extend, then\r\nfor every ploughland four, and so for lack of the rate every ploughland\r\nthree, and the residue of the said acres falling after that rate to be\r\ndivided among the cottagers, paying for every of the said acres 3/4.\"\r\nThis case is the high water mark of administrative interference on\r\nbehalf of the tenants. The action taken embraces nearly all the\r\nexpedients of re-edifying decayed cottages, fixing fair rents,\r\npreventing common land from passing into the control of a single\r\nindividual, and making equal allotment among the inhabitants, which had\r\nbeen demanded by the peasants and suggested by their friends. It shows\r\nthat the enclosing of land hitherto used in common was not resented,\r\nprovided that the division was made in such a way as to give a fair\r\nshare to all the parties interested. It may perhaps be taken as a\r\nspecimen of the kind of policy which lay behind Somerset's expressions\r\nof sympathy with the peasantry, and which he would have pursued if his\r\ncolleagues on the Council had permitted. As it was, he was not strong\r\nenough to carry out his programme. While the failure of the Commission\r\nresulted in the revolts of 1549, his reluctance to crush their authors,\r\nwhom he believed to be men goaded into rebellion by intolerable\r\ngrievances, united the whole weight of the greater property against him\r\nas a traitor to his order. In the attack made upon him as by his\r\ncolleagues, the actions which evoked their special denunciation were\r\nthose which embodied his agrarian policy, the use of the Court of\r\nRequests to protect tenants, the appointment of the Royal Commission to\r\nenforce the Acts against enclosures, the pardon granted in June 1549 to\r\nthe riotous peasants, and the statements attributed to him that \"the\r\ncovetousness of the gentlemen gave cause to the common people to rise,\"\r\nand that \"people had good cause to reform the things themselves,\"\r\nbecause \"the lords of Parliament were loathe to incline themselves to\r\nreformation of enclosures and other things.\"[667] To the last a popular\r\nhero, the \"good Duke\" could expect no help from those whom he had\r\nbefriended, and no mercy from the sordid counter-revolution which he had\r\nprovoked. His epitaph was given by the sad cries of \"Too true,\" with\r\nwhich the crowd about the scaffold greeted his dying declaration that he\r\nhad \"ever been glad of the furtherance ... of the commonwealth.\"[668]\r\n\r\n    [665] See p. 355.\r\n\r\n    [666] _Acts of the Privy Council_, New Series, vol. ii. pp.\r\n    294-296.\r\n\r\n    [667] Strype, _Ecclesiastical Memorials_.\r\n\r\n    [668] Somerset's execution took place on January 22, 1552,\r\n    more than two years after he had been deposed from the\r\n    Protectorate, for supposed complicity in a plot to overthrow the\r\n    Government. The evidence for the existence of a conspiracy\r\n    appears to be feeble. See Pollard, _The Political History of\r\n    England_, 1547-1603, pp. 61-65.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Somerset in October 1549 the landowning classes had\r\ntheir revenge, and, under the guidance of Warwick, the policy of the\r\nGovernment swung violently in the opposite direction. The intervention\r\nof the Council to protect tenants of course stopped at once; in the two\r\ncases which are reported as having come before it in the year 1550 and\r\n1551 the line taken was that the presumption was against the tenants who\r\nhad broken open enclosures.[669] While, in the absence of John Hales,\r\nwho appears to have found it convenient to leave the country, the\r\nReports of the Royal Commission were allowed to slumber, the Government,\r\nby way of reducing opportunities for undesirable meetings, instructed\r\nthe Bishop of London to prevent unseasonable preaching in his diocese,\r\nand set itself to establish the new agrarian régime by law. The ways in\r\nwhich men seek liberty are infinite in number, but the methods of\r\ntyranny are everywhere the same; and the nearest parallel to the\r\nbehaviour of Somerset's successors is the attitude of the panic-stricken\r\naristocracy of the early nineteenth century towards trade unions. Under\r\nan Act of 1550 all meetings of the peasantry were treated as a sort of\r\n\"illegal conspiracy.\" Any forty of them who assembled to break down an\r\nenclosure might be condemned as traitors. Any twelve who assembled for\r\nthe same purpose were guilty of felony, as also were those who summoned\r\nsuch a meeting, or who combined to reduce rents or the price of corn.\r\nEven the rusty legislation of the thirteenth century was revived by the\r\nre-enactment of the Statute of Merton of 1235,[670] which permitted\r\nlords to enclose as much as they pleased, provided that \"sufficient\"\r\nremained over for the tenants, with the significant improvement that the\r\nlatter qualification was swept away by a clause declaring that\r\nenclosures might be made \"notwithstanding their gainsaying and\r\ncontradiction.\" The tyranny of the oligarchy which ruled from 1549 to\r\n1553 has been obscured by the more dramatic events which preceded and\r\nsucceeded it. But it marks the bottom point in the condition of the\r\nsixteenth century peasantry. It indicates how the new agrarian régime\r\nwill develop when the political forces impeding it are removed. More had\r\nasked, What is Government? and had answered that it is \"a certein\r\nconspiracy of riche men procuringe theire owne commodities under the\r\nname and title of a Common Wealth.\" His immortal definition does less\r\nthan justice to the cynicism of the generation which succeeded his own.\r\nMary executed Protestants for reasons of religion, as Elizabeth executed\r\nCatholics for reasons of State. But Warwick, a hypocrite in religion,\r\nwas at least guiltless of the hypocrisy of sheltering his land policy\r\n\"under the name and title of the Common Wealth.\" It was exactly what it\r\nseemed to be, a straightforward attempt to prevent the poor from\r\nprotesting when their possessions were taken from them by the rich.\r\n\r\n    [669] _Acts of the Privy Council_, New Series, vol. iii. pp.\r\n    181-182 and 247 and 252. \"Mr. Grenewaie was this day before the\r\n    Counsaill and rebuked sore for his attemptate in causeng Raf\r\n    Lees hedges to be broaken up; nevertheless considering his long\r\n    service [as gentleman usher] he was borne withall, and for this\r\n    tyme without further punishment he was commaunded to make up\r\n    those hedges again.\"\r\n\r\n    [670] 3 and 4 Edward VI. c. 3.\r\n\r\nThe general policy of the Government during the reign of Elizabeth and\r\nthe first half of the seventeenth century shows neither the desire of\r\nSomerset to undo the agrarian revelation, nor the complete indifference\r\nto the interests of the poorer classes of the party which succeeded him.\r\nDuring the reign of Elizabeth there was little agrarian agitation. It is\r\npossible that the limits of profitable pasture-farming had been reached.\r\nIt is possible that the policy of encouraging the export of corn, which\r\nhad been suggested by Hales, and which was adopted in 1563 and extended\r\nin 1571, reacted favourably on arable farming. It is possible, again,\r\nthat Warwick's measures had had their effect, and that the peasantry had\r\nbeen cowed into silence. Though, on the whole, the Government maintained\r\nthe traditional attitude, it did not interfere except in circumstances\r\nof special hardship, or when there was danger of serious disturbance.\r\nCases of this nature came before it fairly frequently in the reigns of\r\nElizabeth, Charles, and James. One finds it intervening on the ground\r\nthat the poverty of tenants makes it impossible for them to go to law,\r\nor that the offenders concerned are so powerful as to be able to\r\ndisregard inferior authorities, or that the local authorities themselves\r\nhave been unfairly biassed, or to prevent disturbances by hearing\r\ntenants' grievances, or to compel a great noble, like the Earl of\r\nShrewsbury, to reinstate tenants whom it thinks to have been wrongfully\r\nevicted, or to stop action being taken by a landlord pending a decision\r\nby the courts in his favour. In 1579 the Council writes to the Lord\r\nPresident of Wales ordering him to take proceedings against two persons\r\nwho have been enclosing part of the Forest of Fakenham, and have\r\ndisturbed the copyholders; he is to prevent any further enclosures being\r\nmade until the whole matter has been considered by the Government.[671]\r\nIn 1581 it interferes to protect a copyholder who has been kept out of\r\nhis holding by the Dean and Chapter of Peterborough.[672] In 1586 it\r\ndirects the Cambridgeshire justices to inquire into the complaint of\r\nsome tenants who claim that a piece of common pasture has been let over\r\ntheir heads, and to see that both parties to the dispute come before the\r\nJustices of Assize.[673] The Justices of Assize in Norfolk are to take\r\naction in the matter of a common at Kettlestone which two of the tenants\r\nallege to have been overstocked with sheep.[674] Several letters are\r\naddressed to the Council of the Marches of Wales ordering them to\r\nprevent the eviction of copyholders.[675] A landlord is requested to\r\nattend the Council and prove that his tenants' fines are uncertain, and\r\nnot, as they allege, fixed.[676] The Court of Chancery has dismissed a\r\ncase arising out of the enclosure of commons at Bath, and the Council\r\norders a retrial.[677] Occasionally it cites offenders into the Court of\r\nStar Chamber,[678] and in 1592, just when the Court of Requests was\r\nbeginning to be attacked by the common lawyers, we find a case as to\r\nfold-courses coming before the Court of Requests.[679] More often it\r\nappoints special Commissioners to act as arbitrators, or refers\r\npetitioners to the Justices of Assize in their county, with a request to\r\ntake local evidence and inform the Council what they advise. Throughout\r\nthe reigns of James and Charles we get glimpses of administrative\r\nactivity which show that the traditional policy was, perhaps fitfully,\r\nmaintained. In 1603 the Council of the North[680] were instructed to\r\nmake \"from time to time diligent and effectual inquisition of the\r\nwrongful taking in of commons and other grounds, and the decay of\r\ntillage and of towns or houses of husbandry,\" and to correct offenders\r\nwith \"some notable punishment.\" The rebellion in the Midlands in 1607\r\nproduced special measures, the chief offenders being summoned before the\r\nCouncil and bound over to rebuild houses which had fallen into decay,\r\nwhile in the following years two Commissions were appointed to compound\r\nwith enclosers.[681] In Yorkshire the justices are evidently fairly\r\nactive in 1607 and 1608. A Richmond freeholder who owns two-thirds of\r\nthe manor is presented \"for decaying five husbandries, and also for\r\nconverting 30 acres of tillage ground to meadow and pasture,\" and\r\nsimilar presentments are made at Malton, Thirsk, and Helmsley.[682] A\r\nJustice of Assize writes about the same time from the western counties\r\nto the effect that twenty-six houses of husbandry have been rebuilt and\r\nthe offenders punished.[683] In 1614 the justices of Norfolk inform the\r\nCouncil that in accordance with its directions they have examined the\r\nenclosures made in the last two years, and have ordered the hedging and\r\nditching of lands to be stopped till further notice.[684] In the\r\nfollowing year one William Combe was negotiating with the corporation of\r\nStratford for their consent to the enclosure and conversion to pasture\r\nof his freehold lands lying in the common fields at Welcombe; in 1615 an\r\norder made at Warwick Assizes was confirmed by the Chief Justice\r\nrestraining him from doing so on the ground that it was \"against the\r\nlaws of the realm,\" and in the following year a peremptory letter was\r\naddressed to him by the Council directing his compliance.[685] In 1619\r\nthere was a temporary reaction owing to the low price of grain, which\r\nled to the appointment of a Commission to grant pardons for breaches of\r\nthe Acts forbidding enclosure, and in 1624 all the Statutes except the\r\ntwo passed in 1597 were repealed, But this did not stop administrative\r\ninterference. In 1621 the Justices of Assize for Bedfordshire are\r\ndirected to check encroachments on a common, and in 1623 a Commission is\r\nappointed to remove grievances arising in connection with enclosures at\r\nCheshunt.[686] The rise in corn prices which occurred from 1629 to 1631\r\nproduced another burst of activity, which is to be attributed partly to\r\na genuine desire to protect the poorer classes, and partly to the hope\r\nthat the fines imposed upon enclosers might squeeze a few drops into the\r\nGovernment's ever thirsty Exchequer. In 1630 directions were issued by\r\nthe Council to the justices of five Midland counties to remove all\r\nenclosures made in the last two years on the ground that they led to\r\ndepopulation and were particularly harmful in time of dearth.[687] In\r\n1632, 1635, and 1636, three Commissions were appointed, and special\r\ninstructions to enforce the Statutes against enclosure were issued to\r\nthe Justices of Assize.[688] That the inquiry was not a mere formality\r\nis proved by the State Papers of the period. In part of the country, at\r\nany rate, land which had been pasture was ploughed[689] up in obedience\r\nto the Government's orders, and a list of offenders, including--the\r\nGovernment must have seen his name with grim satisfaction--Lord Saye and\r\nSele, was returned to the Council, some of whom were still being\r\nprosecuted in the Court of Star Chamber as late as 1639. This is the\r\nlast occasion on which we can trace the administration of this part of\r\nthe Tudor State policy. The agitation against enclosures was carried on\r\nunder the Commonwealth. The diggers under Winstanley came into\r\nprominence for a moment, only to be disclaimed by the respectable[690]\r\nopponents of enclosure and to be instantly suppressed by the Government,\r\nand there was a crop of pamphlets in the years between 1650 and 1660\r\nwhich dealt with the evils of depopulation in quite the old manner. But\r\nthe traditional doctrine as to the importance of the peasantry had\r\ndecayed, and the central machinery for forcing the justices to take\r\naction had been destroyed in 1641.

Statesmen were certainly\r\nbiassed in favour of protecting the weaker landholding classes. But was\r\ntheir intervention simply the expression of a pious opinion? Was it so\r\nentirely futile as--to give a modern parallel--the Small Holdings Act of\r\n1892? Or did it to any extent modify or retard the course of economic\r\nevents? The view usually taken, that legislation was so ineffective as\r\nto be almost negligible, is in accordance with what we know of the\r\ncharacter of local administration in the sixteenth century, and is\r\nsupported by much contemporary evidence. The constant introduction of\r\nfresh proposals suggests that the previous laws were disappointing. The\r\nfailure of existing Acts was the reason given in Somerset's proclamation\r\nfor the appointment of the Commission of 1548. Hales, who is certainly\r\nthe most reliable authority on the situation between 1540 and 1550,\r\nspeaks of them as being notoriously a dead letter.[692] If one looks at\r\nthe Statutes passed against depopulation in the sixteenth century, with\r\na view to discovering how far they really met the situation, one will be\r\ninclined to say that they quite failed to go to the root of the matter.\r\nThe special evil which they were intended to combat was depopulation\r\ncaused by evictions. But evictions could be checked only by giving\r\ntenants security, which would have meant turning customary into legal\r\ntitles, and fixing judicial rents for leaseholders and immovable fines\r\nfor copyholders; in short, the sort of interference which the peasants\r\nand their champions demanded, but on which no Government depending on\r\nthe support of the landed gentry would venture, except upon an\r\nextraordinary emergency. In the absence of such an attempt to grapple\r\ndirectly with the fundamental fact that the peasants' insecurity made\r\nthem liable to suffer whenever there was a change in the methods of\r\nagriculture, legislation designed merely to prevent those changes was\r\nalmost certain to be evaded. Even with the best intentions the Statutes\r\ncould never have been easy to administer. There was the difficulty\r\ninherent in the whole Tudor and Stuart policy of authoritative\r\ninterference with trade and industry, the difficulty of making State\r\naction keep pace with economic changes. The Government is often like a\r\nman pursuing a tram from one stopping-place to another, and just missing\r\nit at each. It insists that land which has hitherto been in tillage\r\nshall remain in tillage. But there are a few years of bumper harvests,\r\nand the farmers complain that they cannot pay their way.[693] The\r\nGovernment tries to get over the difficulty by allowing them to convert\r\narable to pasture, when a providence unversed in statecraft sends a wet\r\nsummer, and it scrambles hastily back to the position which it has just\r\nabandoned.[694] By excepting from the operation of the Statutes certain\r\ndistricts which are specially suitable for grazing, it encourages a\r\nrough local division of labour, one part of a county confining itself to\r\npasture-farming and another to tillage. But then, in pursuit of its\r\ntraditional and quite reasonable policy of securing that food is cheap,\r\nit insists that all farmers are to supply the markets with grain, with\r\nthe result that those who have specialised in corn-growing are\r\nthreatened with ruin by the fall in prices which ensues, and that it is\r\neven questionable whether they will not convert arable to pasture to\r\nevade the obligation imposed upon them.[695] Old enclosures were\r\ntolerated and new forbidden. But how distinguish between old and new?\r\nLand turned to pasture simply to restore it to a condition in which it\r\nwould be fit for tillage escaped the condemnation passed on other kinds\r\nof \"conversion,\" and one can imagine that nice arguments must have\r\narisen as to a farmer's motives. Again, suppose a man converted to\r\npasture land which should have remained under the plough, and then\r\nleased it to some one else, who retained it as pasture, was the lessee\r\nguilty of an offence? In a case which came before the Court of Exchequer\r\nin 1582, the defendant pleaded that he merely \"used\" the land as\r\npasture, and had not converted it, while the Crown argued that use was\r\nequivalent to conversion, that he was in the position of a man profiting\r\nby the continuance of a nuisance, and that a fine of 10s. an acre for\r\neach year since the original conversion ought to be imposed.[696] Points\r\nlike this give colour to Coke's complaint against the whole body of Acts\r\nagainst enclosure that \"they were labyrinthes, with such intricate\r\nwindings or turnings as little or no fruit proceeded from them.\"\r\n\r\n    [692] Hale's defence in appendix to Miss Lamond's introduction\r\n    to _The Commonweal of this Realm of England_.\r\n\r\n    [693] D'Ewes _Journal_, p. 674 (1601). Mr. Johnson said: \"In the\r\n    time of dearth, when we made this Statute, it was not considered\r\n    that the hand of God was upon us; and now corn is cheap. If too\r\n    cheap, the husbandman is undone.\" See also Raleigh's speech in\r\n    the same debate.\r\n\r\n    [694] _e.g._ in 1593 the clause in the Act of 1563 forbidding\r\n    conversion of arable to pasture was repealed. In 1595 and 1596\r\n    bad harvests produced loud complaints of high prices, and in\r\n    1597 conversion to pasture was again prohibited.\r\n\r\n    [695] _Original Papers of the Norfolk and Norwich Archæological\r\n    Society_, 1907, pp. 131 ff.\r\n\r\n    [696] Moore's _Reports_, p. 117, plea 262, Claypole's case: \"Le\r\n    conseil de Reigne argue que ... l'entent de Estatute fuit que le\r\n    user sera accompt equivalent en tort al convcon.\" Judgment was\r\n    apparently given for the Queen. The decision was quoted as an\r\n    authority in the debate in Parliament on the Bills introduced in\r\n    1597. _Hist. MSS. Com._, MSS. of Marquis of Salisbury, Part\r\n    VII., pp. 541-543: \"And 26 Eliz. in the Exchequer, in Claypole's\r\n    case, an information was exhibited upon the Statute of 4 Hen.\r\n    VII. against a purchaser for converting of tillage into pasture,\r\n    and adjudged good, though the purchaser were not the converter,\r\n    but only a continuer of the first conversion. So as this new law\r\n    tends but for an instruction and explanation of the old.\"\r\n\r\nBut, of course, the obscurity of the Statutes was the least part of the\r\ndifficulty with which Governments who wished to protect the peasantry\r\nwere confronted. Much more serious was the fact that the traditional\r\npolicy could be carried out only by disregarding the financial interests\r\nof the wealthier classes, who could most easily influence Parliament and\r\nthe Council, and who were locally omnipotent. In the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century the high position of many of those who were most\r\ndeeply implicated in cutting land free from communal restrictions made\r\nthem almost unassailable. The Royal Commission of 1517 returned among\r\nenclosers the names of the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Shrewsbury, the\r\nDuke of Buckingham, Lord Danbury, Sir William Bolen, Sir R. Sheffield,\r\nthe Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir J. Witte, the Under-Treasurers\r\nof State, and Sir J. Cotton, who was himself one of the\r\nCommissioners.[697] The angry unanimity with which Somerset's colleague\r\nturned against his land policy was not wonderful, for they were nearly\r\nall directly interested in the maintenance of the _status quo_. Warwick,\r\nwho led the _coup d'état_, had enclosed on a large scale. Sir William\r\nHerbert had made extensive enclosures on the lands which he had acquired\r\nfrom the Abbey of Wilton. The St. John family, the Darcy family, the\r\nEarl of Westmoreland, had all local troubles with their tenants; and\r\nthere are some indications that Sir William Paget and the detested and\r\ndetestable Lord Rich were in the same position.[698]\r\n\r\n    [697] Leadam, _Trans. Royal Hist. Soc._, New Series, vol. vi.\r\n\r\n    [698] For Warwick, Herbert, and the St. Johns, see pp. 326, 368,\r\n    and 362. For Darcy and disturbances in Westmoreland, Gairdner,\r\n    _L. and P. Henry VIII._, xii. II., xii. I., 319, xi. 1080. For\r\n    Paget and Rich, Strype, _Ecclesiastical Memorials_.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, material to trace the records of individual members\r\nof the Council, because their interest in checking the interference of\r\nthe State with the free disposal of land is evident from the fact that\r\nmany of them enormously increased their estates through the share which\r\nthey obtained in the property confiscated from the religious houses and\r\nthe gilds. A comparison of the lists of Privy Councillors for 1548 and\r\n1552, published by Strype,[699] with Dr. Savine's[700] valuable analysis\r\nof the grantees of the monastic estates, show that out of thirty-one\r\npersons who got grants of land of £200 a year or more fourteen were\r\nmembers of the Privy Council in one or other of those years, exclusive\r\nof the Earl of Warwick and Sir William Herbert. This fact is by itself\r\nalmost sufficient to explain the impossibility of enforcing the laws\r\nforbidding depopulation during the years which followed the death of\r\nHenry VIII., and the despair of legal protection which seems to have\r\nsettled upon the classes affected by the movement. The view sometimes\r\nexpressed that the religious houses had been easier landlords than the\r\nlay owners into whose hands their estates passed, though it can\r\noccasionally be corroborated from the complaints made by tenants to the\r\nGovernment, scarcely seems, as yet, to be satisfactorily proved. But the\r\ndistribution among the wealthier classes of land producing a net income\r\nof not less than £110,000 gave them an enormous vested interest in\r\npreventing and evading legislation to check the most profitable use of\r\nthe new possessions which were to endow the aristocracy of the future.\r\nThe supposition of peculiar harshness in the owners to whom the land\r\npassed, though probably correct, is really not needed to explain the\r\npart which the transference of these vast quantities of land had in\r\naugmenting the distress of the rural classes. The worst side of all such\r\ngreat and sudden redistributions of property is that the individual is\r\nmore or less at the mercy of the market, and can hardly help taking his\r\npound of flesh. A buyer must sell at a profit, or he had much better not\r\nhave bought. During the decade between 1540 and 1550 there was a furor\r\nof land speculation. To the Abbey lands, which came into the market\r\nafter 1536, were added those of the gilds and chantries in 1547. It is\r\nquite clear that some of the grantees of estates did not acquire them\r\nwith the intention of retaining them, but simply \"bought for the rise.\"\r\nThe lands of the Abbey of Whitby, for example, pass first to the Crown,\r\nand are then sold by it to the Duke of Northumberland, who in turn sells\r\nthem to Sir John Yorke.[701] A small official in the Royal household\r\nbuys the Cistercian nunnery at Brewood, and at once puts it up to sale\r\n\"for suche a price that no man will gladly by hit at hys hand.\"[702]\r\nTrentham is surrendered to the Crown in 1536; in 1540 the Duke of\r\nSuffolk obtains a grant of the rents and reversions reserved upon the\r\nCrown leases there, and in the same year sells it to one Leveson, who\r\nhas already acquired lands belonging to Horlton Abbey, and already sold\r\nthem again to Biddulph.[703] One finds even the champion of the tenants,\r\nSomerset himself, getting a grant of land from the Crown on July 1st,\r\nleasing part of it for eighty years on July 2nd, and transferring it\r\nback to the Crown, subject to the lease, on July 9th.[704] When property\r\nchanged hands three times in the course of ten days, it could hardly\r\nfail to be rack-rented, or the transaction would not pay. What happened\r\nto the tenants? Here and there, as at Whitby and Washerne,[705] a bitter\r\noutburst against their new masters shows that the result has been what\r\nwe should expect. But for the rest, a cloud descends and we cannot say.\r\nIt is only in such occasional glimpses that we catch the solid earth\r\nshifting beneath the feet of those who till it. It was such a glimpse\r\nwhich led the last great English peasant, in a time of even more\r\nwidespread misery, to say that the wretchedness of the landless labourer\r\nwas the work of the Reformation. Cobbett, and those who follow Cobbett\r\nin representing the economic evils of the sixteenth century as the fruit\r\nof the religious changes, err in linking as parent and child movements\r\nwhich were rather brother and sister, twin aspects of the individualism\r\nwhich seems inseparable from any swift increase in riches. Their vision\r\nof a time when mild ecclesiastics administered their estates as a\r\npopular trust lays a spell upon the imagination. In the religious houses\r\nof Lancashire and Yorkshire and Northumberland there may, here and\r\nthere, even on the eve of the dissolution, have been a reality\r\ncorresponding to it. But we need hardly go further than Sir Thomas\r\nMore[706] to learn that for parts, at least, of England it is only a\r\nvision; and More does not speak without book. Holy men enclose land,\r\nconvert arable to pasture, claim villeins, turn copyholds into tenancies\r\nat will. If prominent ecclesiastics had really wanted to champion the\r\ncause of the peasantry, they had an excellent opportunity when Wolsey\r\nsent out the first great Commission into enclosures in 1517. But, in\r\nfact, there is no reason to suppose that any protest was made at all\r\ncomparable to that which came thirty-two years later from Latimer. How\r\ncould there be? The estates of the larger houses were often scattered\r\nover several different counties, and before the dissolution they were\r\nquite frequently managed by laymen. In such cases the monks were simply\r\nrentiers,[707] who needed to know no more about their tenants than the\r\nfellows of an Oxford college know about theirs at the present day.\r\n\r\n    [699] Strype, _Ecclesiastical Memorials_.\r\n\r\n    [700] Fisher, _The Political History of England_, 1485-1547,\r\n    Appendix II.\r\n\r\n    [701] Selden Society, _Select Cases in the Court of Requests_\r\n    (Leadam).\r\n\r\n    [702] Hibbert, _The Dissolution of the Monasteries_, pp.\r\n    209-210.\r\n\r\n    [703] _Ibid._, p. 210.\r\n\r\n    [704] _Hist.

The change was\r\n    alleged to have been made in 1471.\r\n\r\n    [707] The opposite view is expressed by Gasquet, _Henry the\r\n    Eighth and the English Monasteries_, chap. xxii. For a criticism\r\n    of it see Savine, _Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History_,\r\n    vol. i. pp. 263-267, and pp. 245-260 for facts as to lay\r\n    administrators. Hibbert, _op. cit._, pp. 210-211, who writes of\r\n    Staffordshire, supports Savine rather than Gasquet. The evidence\r\n    of Aske cannot be quoted as though what was true of the northern\r\n    houses were true of all. As a matter of fact, lay estates\r\n    preserved the old conditions in the north long after the\r\n    dissolution (see pp. 189-191). The hatred of the new landlords\r\n    is proof that they were specially detestable, rather than that\r\n    the monasteries had been above all ordinary economic\r\n    considerations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though facts will not allow us to accept the view which\r\nascribes the agrarian distress of our period to the Reformation, or even\r\nto the particular changes brought about by the secularisation of\r\nreligious endowments, there was a real connection between them. The\r\nReformation in England is as much a social as a religious revolution. As\r\na social revolution it is the work of the commercial and middle classes.\r\nIt \"made of yeomen and artificers gentlemen, and of gentlemen knights,\r\nand so forth upward, and of the poorest sort stark beggars.\"[708] Their\r\nsupport is given, in the main, on strict business principles. It is\r\npurchased by ensuring that every one who counts shall have a solid\r\nmaterial interest in supporting the new order. The great Elizabethan\r\nfamilies, the Cecils, the Herberts, the Grenvilles, are well paid in\r\nadvance for their services, and continue to be paid long after their\r\nservices have ceased. The dissolution of the monasteries does for their\r\nplastic consciences what the foundation of the Bank of England did for\r\nthe politics of the City Interest under William III. Having invested in\r\nthe Reformation at a time when the Reformation is a gambling stock,\r\nthey nurse the security with a solicitude which title-deeds have done\r\nmore to inspire than the New Testament, and are zealous to lay up for\r\nthemselves treasures in Heaven, as the best insurance for the treasures\r\nwhich they have already accumulated on earth. A man who looks from the\r\nwindow of his new mansion on the timber in his new park may well think\r\nit worth the sacrifice of many masses. Though the economic effect of\r\nendowing our landed gentry is not reducible to figures, it is not rash\r\nto say that men who have sprung into wealth by suddenly purchasing new\r\nestates will make those estates pay. And this means that ultimately the\r\ncost will be borne by their tenants. That the new proprietors will be\r\nextraordinarily sensitive to attacks on the rights of property goes\r\nwithout saying. The lectures[709] delivered to the peasants by the\r\n_nouveaux riches_ of 1549 on the wickedness of agrarian spoliation have\r\nan irony which is eternal.\r\n\r\n    [708] Quoted by Gasquet, _op. cit._, p. 464, from a document\r\n    written about 1591.\r\n\r\n    [709] _e.g._ Paget's letter to Somerset, July 7, 1549 (Strype,\r\n    _Ecclesiastical Memorials_). Neville, De furoribus Norfolcensium\r\n    Ketto Duce, 1575. The words put into the mouths of the landed\r\n    gentry by Crowley in _The Way to Wealth_ (E. E. T. S.) no doubt\r\n    represent their attitude fairly: \"Nowe if I should demand of the\r\n    gredie cormoraunts what they thinke should be the cause of\r\n    sedition, they would saie, 'The paisent knaves be too welthy,\r\n    provender pricketh them. They knowe no obedience, they regard no\r\n    lawes, they would have no gentlemen, they would have all men\r\n    like themselves, they would have all things commune. They would\r\n    not have us master of that which is our owne. They will appoint\r\n    us what rent we shall take for our grounds.... They will caste\r\n    down our parkes and lay our pastures open.... They wyll compel\r\n    the Kyng to graunt theyr requests.... We wyll tech them to know\r\n    theyr betters, and because they would have all in common we will\r\n    leave them nothing.'\"\r\n\r\nApart from the special interest which the purchasers of the estates of\r\nmonastic and gild estates had in keeping a completely free hand over\r\ntheir disposal, the normal organisation of English local government made\r\neffective State interference very difficult. As has often been pointed\r\nout, its peculiar strength lay in the success with which it made the\r\nordinary relationships between social classes the machinery for\r\nexecuting the mandates of the State, by entrusting administration, not\r\nto officials of the Central Government, but to persons who already\r\npossessed local authority, and who were confirmed in it, rather than\r\ngiven it, by the Crown. Such a system was favourable to the development\r\nof representative government and of political freedom, because it\r\nstrengthened instead of repressing the local initiative on which the\r\nsuccess of representative government ultimately depends. But the very\r\nabsence of bureaucracy had the disadvantage that it made it almost\r\nimpossible to enforce the regular administration of the law, whenever it\r\nconflicted with the local interests of classes who sat on the county\r\nbench. A not unimportant chapter in English history is contained in the\r\ncomplaint of the Norfolk rebels that the legislation of the last fifty\r\nyears had been \"hidden\" from them by the Justices of the Peace. The\r\naccount of the proceedings of the Commission of 1548, which had to drag\r\ninformation out of juries packed with the employees of enclosing\r\nlandlords, and from witnesses who gave it under threat of\r\neviction--above all, the pained amazement of a great landowner who found\r\nthat the Commission declined to accept evidence from his servants as\r\nunbiassed--is a specimen so typical, that, if it were found in\r\nisolation, we could hardly fail to fit it back into its English\r\ncontext.[710] Hales, the one statesman whom the agrarian problem\r\nproduced, put his finger on the root of the difficulty in the third Bill\r\nwhich he introduced into Parliament in 1548. The substance of its\r\nproposals, though sufficiently rigorous to modern notions, was not in\r\nitself more drastic than others which actually became law. Its novelty\r\nlay in the machinery by which it was to be enforced. Surveys of pastures\r\nwere to be made annually by the curate and two men of every parish, and\r\nthose breaking the law were to be presented for trial. In other words,\r\nthe initiative in returning offences was to be taken by those chiefly\r\ninterested in preventing them. According to Hales, it was the last\r\nprovision for making the administration of the Statute a reality which\r\nParliament found intolerable.[711]\r\n\r\n    [710] Appendix to Introduction to _The Commonweal of this Realm\r\n    of England_ (Lamond), p. lix.\r\n\r\n    [711] _Ibid._, p. lxv.: \"This was it that byt the mare by the\r\n    thombe.\"\r\n\r\nMust we, then, dismiss the efforts of the Tudor and Stuart statesmen to\r\nsoften the harshness of the agrarian revolution as a mere piece of\r\nsolemn futility? The simplicity of the solution makes it a tempting one;\r\nbut it is too simple to be true. In the first place we must notice that\r\nour literary evidence is one-sided, because it is fullest for just those\r\nyears during which an exceptional freedom from restraint was enjoyed by\r\nthe great landlords. It is inevitable that Latimer and Hales should\r\noften be quoted. But one cannot argue from comments on the uselessness\r\nof legislation, uttered at a time when the Statutes against enclosing\r\nwere virtually repealed, to show that the law was equally ineffective\r\nunder Elizabeth and her two successors. And, in the second place, to\r\nhold that the frequent intervention of the Council had no result is\r\nreally an unjustifiably high-handed proceeding. It runs counter to most\r\nof what we know of the administration of the period. A Statute might be\r\na dead letter, but a letter from the Council was meant to be obeyed. By\r\n1552 the Government has discovered the uselessness of relying for the\r\nenforcement of the law on the intervention of superior lords, and places\r\nits administration in the hands of special Commissioners directly\r\nresponsible to the Central Government. Such a view runs counter to the\r\nopinion of the peasants and of the upper classes. The victims of\r\nagrarian oppression recognise that though they have little to hope from\r\nthe local authorities, who are their landlords and employers, the\r\nGovernment's policy is on the whole favourable to them, and they deluge\r\nit with appeals for protection. The justices are naturally no friends to\r\nthat policy. But in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries they are by\r\nno means the independent autocracy which they became later, and are\r\nwatched closely by the Privy Council. From Norfolk, Nottinghamshire,\r\nLincolnshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and the west of England, they\r\nsend returns to the Government of their action,[712] and the Government\r\nis quite ready, as we have seen, to revise the action of its delegates\r\nwhen it thinks they have been biassed by personal interests. In\r\nYorkshire the juries of several townships present offenders before the\r\njustices. The authorities of Southampton[713] take steps to put the Acts\r\nagainst enclosure into force. The authorities of Norfolk[714] request\r\nthat they may enjoy the exemption which has been granted them. When in\r\n1597, a year in which legislation against enclosures is in the air, the\r\nEarl of Huntingdon asks the burgesses of Leicester to return his nominee\r\nto Parliament, they refuse bluntly to do anything of the kind, on the\r\nground that the candidate in question is \"an encloser himself and\r\ntherefore unlikely to redress that wrong in others.\"[715] The courts\r\nhear a large number of cases dealing with offences committed under the\r\nenclosing Statutes.[716] Individuals obtain special permission, either\r\nby royal license or by Act of Parliament, to use as pasture land which,\r\nlike undrained marshes, is obviously unsuitable for ploughing. No one\r\nwho is reported as having taken part in the Parliamentary discussions of\r\nproposed legislation in the closing years of Elizabeth suggests that it\r\nmust necessarily be a dead letter. The chief fear that seems to have\r\nbeen felt was lest it should prove too effective. In introducing two\r\nBills against enclosure and depopulation in 1597, Bacon apologised to\r\nthe great landlords for taking action which was likely to prejudice\r\ntheir interests. When the question of continuing the Act against\r\ndepopulation, which was in force in 1601, was under consideration in the\r\nHouse of Commons, both the members who argued for continuance and those\r\nwho argued for repeal, assumed that the law was being administered in\r\npractice, one speaker urging that it had the result of keeping so much\r\nland in tillage as to destroy the farmer's profits by causing excessive\r\nsupplies of grain to be placed on the market in any but the worst years;\r\nanother that it pressed hardly on the small farmer, who could not easily\r\nfind the capital needed to sow as much land as he was legally bound to\r\nplough.[717] The ablest and most fully reported speech[718] which has\r\ncome down to us is that of an anonymous member, who, while approving of\r\nthe principle of the Bill, attacked it as too loosely drafted to meet\r\nthe situation. His criticisms are those of a man who understands his\r\nsubject, and are on just those points of detail which, though important\r\nin a measure which is to work, would not be worth considering at all if\r\nanything like effective interference were out of the question. After\r\ncommending the clauses which excepted from the provisions of the Bill\r\nland lying temporarily fallow, and which punished the purchasers as well\r\nas the original converter of arable which was turned into pasture, he\r\ngoes on to point out that loopholes have been left in the measure which\r\nare likely to stultify its effect. The exemption of Crown lands from its\r\noperation will encourage enclosing landlords to exchange properties with\r\nthe Crown, and then take on lease as tenants the land which they have\r\nhanded over, since by doing so, they will escape the risk of\r\nprosecution. The persistent lobbying of the interests affected--\"the\r\nears of our great sheepmasters do hang at the doors of this house\"--has\r\nresulted in the fine for enclosing being placed as low as 10s. per acre,\r\nwhich is ridiculously disproportionate to the profits to be made by\r\nenclosures. The clause excluding from the reconversion prescribed in the\r\nBill lands mown for hay plays into the hands of the enclosers by\r\nfacilitating the winter feeding of their sheep. The failure to limit the\r\nacreage which a man may keep in his own hands will discourage the\r\ncreation of small holdings. At a later date there is the same belief,\r\nboth among those who approve, and among those who dislike, enclosure,\r\nthat enclosing can be checked, at any rate, by the Government. In the\r\nkeen controversy over enclosures which raged under the commonwealth the\r\nopponents of further restriction urged that the mere threat of\r\nlegislation had resulted in checking agricultural enterprise.[719]\r\nHarrington,[720] a specialist, not to say a faddist, on agrarian\r\npolicy, bases his interpretation of the history of the preceding century\r\non the supposed success of the Tudors in keeping the small cultivator on\r\nthe soil. Even in the middle of the eighteenth century, when the golden\r\nage of the enclosing landlord was just about to dawn, some dim memory of\r\nthe earlier State policy seems in parts of England to have survived.\r\n\"Why,\" asked a foreign traveller,[721] \"do your farmers not keep\r\nseparate closes under turnips to feed sheep in the new approved manner?\"\r\n\"Partly,\" answer the peasants, \"because there is a common rotation of\r\ncrops which all must follow. But the principal reason of all is that on\r\na common land no one has freedom to enclose his strips without a special\r\npermission and Act of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n    [712] For Norfolk and the West of England, Leonard, _Trans.\r\n    Royal Hist.

The exact\r\n    words are: \"Nor had they any turnip land to feed sheep upon.\r\n    Therefore they were deprived of the advantage of getting to sell\r\n    any fat sheep or other cattle. The reason they gave for all this\r\n    was that their arable was common field, and thus came to lie\r\n    every other year fallow, when one commoner always had to\r\n    accommodate his crops to the others; but the principal reason of\r\n    all was said to be that,\" and so on as in text. I am not sure\r\n    that I have interpreted the passage rightly in assuming that it\r\n    alludes to the _illegality_ of enclosure without Act of\r\n    Parliament. It may merely mean that, without an Act of\r\n    Parliament, the necessary agreement could not be obtained among\r\n    all those interested. I follow Dr. Slater's interpretation.\r\n\r\nWhat weight is to be attached to this body of opinion that enclosure and\r\nconversion to pasture were in practice checked by the opposition of the\r\nGovernment, it is not easy to say. If it is hardly compatible with the\r\nview that interference was entirely ineffective, it nevertheless need\r\nnot imply anything more than a temporary retardation of the movement on\r\nthose special occasions and in those particular parts of the country\r\nthat were the object of peculiar attention. The test of comparison with\r\nfacts by which one would like to try it is difficult to apply. Our\r\nknowledge of the real extent of enclosure in the sixteenth century is\r\ntoo scanty to permit of our following with confidence the line of\r\nargument which has been ingeniously worked out by Miss Leonard,[722] and\r\nwhich, starting from the indisputable fact that in those Midland\r\ncounties where enclosure had been felt most acutely in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, there was still much land unenclosed in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth, suggests that the explanation is to be found in its\r\ntemporary cessation under the authoritative pressure of the Tudor and\r\nStuart Governments. Nevertheless, without going beyond our evidence, we\r\nmay venture to put forward two propositions. The first is that it is\r\nextremely improbable that the anti-enclosing policy which we have traced\r\nsucceeded in altering permanently or on a large scale the course of\r\neconomic development. That suggestion is surely incredible in view of\r\nthe continuance of the complaints against enclosure, and of what we know\r\nof the slack and biassed routine of rural administration. To expect the\r\njustices to stop enclosing, unless actually compelled to do so, was\r\nalmost as Utopian as it was to expect them to administer the early\r\nFactory Acts two centuries later. The second is that the intervention of\r\nthe Government certainly mitigated the hardships of the movement to the\r\nrural classes. The protection which the Court of Star Chamber and the\r\nCourt of Requests offered to the equitable interests of tenants, while\r\nit could not turn the general course of events, tempered its harshness\r\nto individuals. A landlord who was determined to depopulate could hardly\r\nin the long run be prevented from succeeding in his object. But he might\r\nhave to wait till leases or life tenancies had expired, instead of being\r\nable to clear his estate at one sweep. He might be compelled, as the St.\r\nJohns[723] were in the reign of Henry VIII., as Sir John Yorke in 1553,\r\nor Lloyd under Elizabeth, to bind himself to respect the titles of the\r\nexisting generation of tenants. In the same way the occasional campaigns\r\nundertaken for the reconversion of pasture to arable, while they could\r\nnot turn the tide, almost certainly slackened its course. There is no\r\nway of escaping from the positive evidence which we possess that in\r\nparts of the country houses which had been pulled down were rebuilt, and\r\nthat land which had been turned from arable to pasture was turned back\r\nagain, at the command of the Government, from pasture to arable. We have\r\nalready described the doings of the justices under James I. Look for a\r\nmoment at the similar agitation which was started in 1630. The agrarian\r\npolicy of the Council is seen at its worst under Charles I., because the\r\nwhole of it is smeared with the trail of finance. Some of the offenders\r\nwere allowed to compound upon payment of a fine, and one's first\r\ninclination is to believe that the Commissions of 1632, 1635, and 1636\r\nwere nothing but one of those odious financial engines, like the revival\r\nof forest claims and the exaction of fines for knighthood, by which\r\nCharles tried to dispense with Parliamentary taxation. That they were\r\nthis among other things is certain. That they were nothing more than\r\nthis must be denied, for we have clear evidence from enclosers\r\nthemselves to the contrary. They do not only, like Lord Brudenell, write\r\nto the Council begging that their fines may be reduced from £1000 to\r\n£500, and explaining that \"the enclosures made within man's memory\r\namount not to the decay of one farm.\"[724] They are not only haled\r\nbefore the Star Chamber to be rebuked by Laud.[725] They beg to be\r\nallowed to pay a fine instead of being imprisoned. They reconvert\r\npasture to arable. In Northamptonshire[726] a man turns thirty-five\r\nacres of arable into pasture. But he ploughs up ninety-five acres of\r\nancient pasture to set off against it. From Nottinghamshire[727] comes a\r\nletter explaining that the petitioner has complied with the orders of\r\nthe Commissioners of Depopulation to throw open all his enclosures, and\r\napologising humbly for keeping hedges round three acres on the ground\r\nthat they are necessary to mark the boundaries.\r\n\r\n    [722] _Trans.

It retarded, though it could not\r\ncheck altogether, economic changes. It imposed a brake which somewhat\r\neased the shock of sudden movements. But when the hand of authority was\r\nremoved, when Commissions were called in and justices ceased to be\r\nadmonished by the Council, affairs swung back into their original\r\nposition. A rough attempt to illustrate the occasional retardation of\r\npasture-farming by these spasmodic attacks upon it is given in the\r\ndiagram opposite.\r\n\r\nThe figures are taken from a list of Final Concords as to land lying\r\nmainly in Staffordshire, but occasionally in other counties as well. The\r\nperiod selected is one in which there were two agitations among the\r\npeasants, two important Acts against depopulation, and a Royal\r\nCommission. It will be seen that while some of the fluctuations in the\r\npercentages of arable and pasture bear no relation to any known activity\r\non the part of the Government, the repeal in 1593 of the Acts for the\r\nmaintenance of tillage comes as a climax to a well-defined increase in\r\nthe percentage of pasture, the passage of the two Acts of 1599 is\r\nfollowed by a similar though less marked rise in the percentage of\r\narable, and the riots of 1607, which resulted in the appointment of a\r\nRoyal Commission, appear to be accompanied by another increase in the\r\narea under the plough. Of course the acreage represented is absurdly\r\nsmall, and it is possible that the apparent correlation is a mere\r\ncoincidence. Still, one is inclined to think that the fluctuations on\r\nthe chart fit in very well with what we know from other sources of the\r\ntemporary effect and subsequent ineffectiveness of these transient\r\neruptions of governmental activity. The creation of social habits by\r\ncontinuous pressure, such as is exercised by modern states through their\r\npaid inspectorates, is quite foreign to the ideas of the age. The\r\nGovernment, when it is most active, never gets beyond making an example\r\nof a few notorious offenders whose sins are sufficiently black to bring\r\nin good round sums to the Exchequer, and having vindicated the majesty\r\nof the law and pocketed their fines, it leaves the small fry to wonder,\r\nand hastily set their house in order against the coming of the Judges of\r\nAssize, and then gradually to slide back into the ancient ways when the\r\nstorm has blown over. After all, the fact that A was punished for\r\nenclosing last year is in itself sufficient to make it extremely\r\nprobable that this year B will escape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The figures for 1592-3 and 1593-4 have been combined, as\r\nthe latter are too small to be given separately._]\r\n\r\nSuch \"occasional conformity\" was, however, too much the rule in all\r\neconomic matters that were the object of authoritative regulation--and\r\nfew were not--to be by itself any cause for abandoning it. The real\r\nreason for the cessation of interference in the land question which we\r\nnotice after 1640 is to be found, not in the fact that intervention had\r\ninvariably proved too ineffective to be worth continuing, but in the\r\nchange of policy caused by the unchecked domination of Parliament in\r\ndomestic affairs. The victory of the Parliamentary forces over the Crown\r\nmeant the triumph of the landed gentry over the only power which was\r\nstrong enough to enforce the administration of unpopular Statutes in the\r\nteeth of their opposition. It prepared the way for the reign of the\r\ngreat landlord who regards himself as charged with a peculiar\r\nresponsibility for promoting the needs of agriculture, which he alone is\r\npresumed to understand--and in fact, to do him justice, does sometimes\r\nunderstand very thoroughly--a weary Titan who pushes forward enclosure\r\nfrom a sheer sense of public duty. On the one hand there is a change in\r\nthe standpoint from which agrarian policy is regarded. The aim of\r\nmaintaining a prosperous peasantry becomes subordinate to that of\r\nobtaining the maximum output from the soil. This change materially\r\naffects the attitude adopted towards enclosure. The Tudor Governments\r\nhad endeavoured to protect the rights of commoners, because commons were\r\nan indispensable adjunct to small-scale subsistence farming. The new\r\nview is that commons are waste lands which had much better be improved,\r\nand which are most likely to be improved if they pass into the control\r\nof men who have capital to spend upon them. Even under the Stuarts this\r\ndoctrine begins to gather weight, and naturally so, for it both\r\nflattered their ambitious conception of the monarchy as a cornucopia\r\nwhence all economic improvements should flow, and was in line with their\r\ngeneral policy of trying to secure cheap food by regulating the supplies\r\nof grain. In 1623 Commissioners are busy improving Tiptree Heath, which\r\nsquatters have occupied without any legal title.[728] In 1637 the King\r\nis approached by an influential syndicate which asks for a concession\r\npermitting it to reclaim the heaths and barren commons belonging to\r\nthe Crown, and which displays a glowing prospectus of the advantages\r\nwhich will accrue in the shape of increased supplies of\r\nfood-stuffs.[729] In 1629 the Commission of Sewers had engaged Vermuyden\r\non his celebrated task of draining the great Level, and, in spite of the\r\nfierce opposition of the fenmen, the work was in 1637 adjudged to be\r\ncompleted.[730] All this is quite in the vein of the eighteenth century.\r\nIt is quite in that vein also for a strong line to be taken against the\r\nwastefulness of those who impede good farming, even though the farmer be\r\na grazier, by sowing a few acres here and a few acres there, instead of\r\ncultivating a compact holding; in short, by the immemorial system of\r\nstrip cultivation. The last but one of the Statutes against\r\ndepopulation[731] was itself the first expressly to authorise that\r\nexchanging of holdings for the purposes of more business-like husbandry,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, had been going on informally from an early date.\r\nIn 1606 we get what may be called the first Enclosure Act of the modern\r\npattern, under which certain Herefordshire parishes are allowed to\r\nseparate and enclose one-third of the land lying in common in each\r\nparish.[732] In 1627 a case arising out of a dispute about fold-courses\r\ncomes before the courts, and sound agricultural doctrine is laid down\r\nwith a confidence of which Arthur Young himself might have approved.\r\n\"This Court,\" say the judges, \"was now of opinion that the plowing and\r\nsowing of small quantities of land dispersedlye or disorderlye within ye\r\nshacks and winter feedinge of ye said ffouldcourses, and the refusal of\r\na few wilfull persons to lett ye owners of ffouldcourses have their\r\nquillets of land (Llying intermixt in the places where ye sheep pasture\r\nis layd) upon indifferent exchange or other recompense for the same, are\r\nthings very mischievous and will tend to ye overthrow of very many fould\r\ncourses.\"[733] Their opinion is enforced with a judgment decreeing an\r\nexchange of lands.\r\n\r\n    [728] _S.

But its defenders\r\nhave overhauled their arguments, and the lines on which the controversy\r\nwill be fought out for the next century and a half are already obvious.\r\nIn the eyes of the austere moralists of the Restoration commoners are\r\nlewd people, who would be much better employed if at work for wages. All\r\nbeneath the \"nobility and gentry\" are \"the poor,\" and the poor\r\nthemselves (it is well known) are of two kinds, \"the industrious poor,\"\r\nwho make a living by working for their betters, and \"the idle poor,\" who\r\nmake a living by working for themselves. Christianity and patriotism\r\nrequire that the latter should enter some \"productive employment,\" and\r\nthis can best be secured by excluding them from the commons on which\r\ntheir distressingly irregular livelihood depends. Even so Europeans\r\nto-day teach habits of industry to the African savage, by taxing him\r\nuntil he can no longer live upon the lands which Europeans desire to\r\nexploit. Moreover, the commercial spirit of the later seventeenth\r\ncentury is impatient of antiquated restrictions, and is already groping\r\nblindly after some formula which may prove them to be superfluous.\r\nEnclosures will increase the output of wool and grain. Each man knows\r\nbest what his land is best suited to produce, and the general interest\r\nwill be best served by leaving him a free hand to produce it. \"It is an\r\nundeniable maxim,\" writes a pamphleteer, \"that every one by the light of\r\nnature and reason will do that which makes for his greatest advantage.\r\nWhensoever corn bear a considerable rate, viz., wheat four or five\r\nshillings, and barley two shillings and sixpence, men may make more\r\nprofit by ploughing their pasture, and consequently will plough for\r\ntheir own advantage.\"[734] Hales had said something like this a hundred\r\nyears before. He had said it to show the need of special measures to\r\ndivert agricultural enterprise into beneficial channels. Now an\r\nidentity between the interests of landowners and those of the public is\r\nassumed as part of a pre-established harmony, which human intervention\r\nmay disturb, but which it is neither needed nor competent to secure.\r\nAuthoritative statecraft fades out in the dawn of reason and the light\r\nof nature. With such a wind of doctrine in their sails men are steering\r\nfor uncharted waters.\r\n\r\n    [734] Lee, _A Vindication of a Regulated Enclosure_, 1656.\r\n\r\nWhile opinion on the subject of enclosing was beginning to change even\r\nbefore the Civil War, the final blow at the maintenance of the old\r\npolicy was struck by the destruction of the Court of Requests and Court\r\nof Star Chamber. The abandonment by Governments of all attempts to\r\nprotect the peasantry against oppression was an indirect consequence of\r\nthe victory of the Common Law over the prerogative jurisdiction of the\r\nCrown. The interference in agrarian matters of the administrative courts\r\nof the Tudor monarchy had always been detested by the landed gentry for\r\nthe very reasons which made it popular with the peasantry. They were the\r\nlast resort of men who could not get what they considered justice\r\nelsewhere. One finds a defendant in whose favour the Common Law Courts\r\nhave given three decisions being sued again before the Court of\r\nRequests.[735] They were the only authority which could prevent a\r\nlandlord from asserting his claims to a common or to a copyhold by means\r\nwhich the poorer classes found it impossible to resist. Complaints from\r\naggrieved landowners that they are undermining the right of the lord of\r\nthe manor to exercise jurisdiction over his own copyholders, by trying\r\ncases which ought to be heard in manorial courts, that they are\r\ninterfering with the course of Common Law, that they make it impossible\r\nfor a lord to \"rule his lands\" by the countenance which they lend to\r\ndiscontent, are not infrequent[736] in the sixteenth century, and both\r\nWolsey and Somerset were in turn attacked by the upper classes for the\r\nfavour which they showed to such unconstitutional interference with\r\nthe rights of property. Such protests are the best proof that the\r\nCourt of Requests and the Court of Star Chamber had exercised functions\r\nwhich were in some respects beneficial. The strictest constitutionalist\r\nwill have some sympathy to spare for the address in which Lord Coventry\r\nin 1635 charges the Judges of Assize to \"beware of the corruptions of\r\nsheriffs and their deputies, partiality of jurors, the bearing and\r\nsiding with men of power and countenance in their country,\" and to set\r\non foot \"strict inquiry after depopulation and enclosures, an oppression\r\nof a high nature and commonly done by the greatest persons that keep the\r\njuries under their awe, which was the cause there are no more presented\r\nand brought in question.\"[737] Such words paint the ideal of Government\r\nby prerogative, _parcere subjectis et debellare superbos_, which may\r\nhave floated before the minds of a Bacon or a Strafford, and which had\r\nbeen partially realised under the Government of Elizabeth. When set side\r\nby side with the actual practice of the Council under Charles I. they\r\nare its final and self-recorded condemnation. For we look for them to be\r\nmade good in action, and we look, save during a few years, in vain. If\r\nmuch may be forgiven those who boldly do wrong believing it to be right,\r\nthere is no mercy for \"the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin\" of a body\r\nwhich, believing a certain system of government to be right, entangles\r\nits execution with sloth, and makes a sordid financial instrument out of\r\nthe very prerogative which itself has declared to be the gift of God for\r\nthe protection of the poor. The defence which the Council and its\r\ncourts had offered to the peasantry against economic evils, though real,\r\nwas too irregular to do more than slightly mitigate the verdict which\r\nhistory has passed upon their employment in the hands of Charles I.\r\nWhether the peasants regretted their disappearance we do not know. To\r\nthose contemporaries whose opinion counted, the occasional onslaughts\r\nmade by the Council and Star Chamber upon enclosing landlords were an\r\naggravation, not an extenuation, of the indictment brought against them.\r\nThough the Grand Remonstrance, in which the Long Parliament sought to\r\nunite all classes with a recital of grievance accumulated upon\r\ngrievance, taunted the Government with its failure to check the\r\nconversion of arable land to pasture,[738] the authors of that\r\ntremendous indictment had no substitute to suggest for the interference\r\nby the Council with \"freeholds, estates, suits, and actions,\" which they\r\ndenounced; and Laud, who, according to even a friendly critic, \"did a\r\nlittle too much countenance the Commission for Depopulation,\"[739] lived\r\nto be reminded in the day of his ruin of the sharp words with which he\r\nhad barbed the fine imposed by that body upon an enclosing\r\nlandlord.[740] The Court of Requests was never formally abolished, but\r\nfrom the closing decade of the sixteenth century it had been gradually\r\nstripped of its powers by prohibitions issued by the Common Law Judges,\r\nand forbidding plaintiffs to proceed with their cases before it, and\r\nafter 1642 it quietly disappeared. With the destruction in 1641 of the\r\nCourt of Star Chamber and the Councils of Wales and of the North, an end\r\nwas put to the last administrative organs which could bridle the great\r\nlanded proprietors. Clarendon, himself a relic of an age before the\r\ndeluge, would seem to have added to his other offences by trying to\r\nrevive the old policy in a world which would have none of it.[741] But\r\nthe royalist squirearchy who in 1660 streamed back to their plundered\r\nmanors, were, when their property was at stake, as sound\r\nconstitutionalists as Hampden himself, and after 1688 that absorption of\r\nthe \"State\" by \"Society\" which Gneist, a worshipper of the eighteenth\r\ncentury régime, dates with curious perversity from 1832, was, in his\r\nsense of the words, complete. Henceforward there was to be no obstacle\r\nto enclosure, to evictions, to rack-renting, other than the shadowy\r\nprotection of the Common Law; and for men who were very poor or easily\r\nintimidated, or in enjoyment of rights for which no clear legal title\r\ncould be shown, the Common Law, with its expense, its packed juries, its\r\nstrict rules of procedure, had little help. Thus the good side of the\r\nAbsolute Monarchy was swept away with the bad. Its epitaph was written\r\nby Locke:[742]--\"The supreme power cannot take from any man any part of\r\nhis property without his own consent.\" But it was forgotten as soon as\r\nit was written. For to the upper classes in the eighteenth century the\r\npossession of landed property by a poor man seemed in itself a\r\nsurprising impertinence which it was the duty of Parliament to correct,\r\nand Parliament responded to the call of its relatives outside the House\r\nwith the pious zeal of family affection.\r\n\r\n    [735] Holkham MSS., Sparham Bdle., No. 5, see back, p. 374.\r\n\r\n    [736] Selden Society, _Select Cases in the Court of Requests_,\r\n    Customarye Tenants of Bradford _v._ Fraunceys: \"The seyd\r\n    defendant seythe that the said bill of complaint ... is mater\r\n    ... determinable at the comen land and not in this honourable\r\n    court, whereunto he prayeth to be remitted.\" Also Gairdner, _L.\r\n    & P.

What are the main landmarks which stand out\r\nfrom the bewildering variety of scenery? How does the agrarian England\r\nwhich is sleepily hunting out old guns and older bows on the eve of the\r\nCivil War differ from the England which saw the first Tudor 'with\r\ngeneral applause and joy, in a kind of military election or recognition,\r\nsaluted King?'\"\r\n\r\nAt first sight it differs but little. To see our subject in its proper\r\nperspective we must emphasise the continuity of economic life between\r\n1485 and 1642 as much as in the preceding pages we have emphasised the\r\nnovelty of some of its experiments. We must turn from Fitzherbert and\r\nHales to Arthur Young. We must set Latimer's lamentations over the decay\r\nof the yeomanry side by side with the figures of Gregory King and the\r\nboasts of Chamberlayne and Defoe. We must compare our sporadic\r\nenclosures with the two thousand six hundred Enclosure Acts which were\r\npassed between 1702 and 1810. The outward appearance of many English\r\nvillages at the Revolution would be quite unrecognisable to-day, but it\r\ncan have been but little altered from what it had been at the time of\r\nthe Peasants' Revolt. It could still be said that three-fifths of the\r\ncultivated land of England was unenclosed. And if Piers Plowman had\r\ndreamed for four centuries on Malvern Hills he might still have woken to\r\nplough his half acre between the balks of a still open field, like that\r\n\"very wide field,\" with crooked ways butting upon it and a wicket-gate\r\non its shining horizon, through which Christian sped from Evangelist,\r\ncrying \"Life, Life, Eternal Life.\"\r\n\r\nOught we, then, to say that the agrarian revolution of the sixteenth\r\ncentury was insignificant, and that it has been magnified into\r\nimportance only by the rhetorical complaints of unskilful observers? The\r\nanswer has been given by implication in the preceding pages. The fact\r\nthat statistical evidence reveals no startling disturbance in area\r\nenclosed or population displaced, is no bar to the belief that, both in\r\nimmediate consequences and in ultimate effects, the heavy blows dealt in\r\nthat age at the traditional organisation of agriculture were an episode\r\nof the first importance in economic and social development. The\r\nbarometer which registers climatic variations yields no clue to their\r\ninfluence on the human constitution, and the quantitative rule by which\r\nwe measure economic changes bends in our hands when we use it to\r\nappraise their results. The difference between prosperity and distress,\r\nor enterprise and routine, or security and its opposite, is scarcely\r\nmore susceptible of expression in figures than is the difference between\r\ncivilisation and barbarism itself. In the infinite complexity of human\r\nrelationships, with their interplay of law with economics, and of\r\neconomics with politics, and of all with the shifting hopes and fears,\r\nbaseless anticipations and futile regrets, of countless individuals, a\r\nchange which to the statistician concerned with quantities seems\r\ninsignificant, may turn a wheel whose motion sets a world of unseen\r\nforces grinding painfully round into a new equilibrium. Not only our\r\nestimate of the importance of social alterations, but their actual\r\nimportance itself, depends upon what we are accustomed to and what we\r\nexpect. Just as modern manufacturing nations groan over a reduction in\r\nexports, which in the reign of Henry VIII. would have passed unnoticed,\r\nor are convulsed by a rise in general prices, which, when expressed in\r\npercentages, seems ridiculously small, so the stationary rural society\r\nof Tudor England may well have been shaken to its core by agrarian\r\nchanges which, in a world where rural emigration is the rule, would\r\nappear almost too minute to be recorded. If contemporaries, to whom the\r\nvery foundation of a healthy economic life seemed to be shattered,\r\nunderestimated the capacity of society for readjustment, they were not\r\nmistaken in their supposition that the readjustment required would be so\r\nvast and painful as to involve the depression of important orders of\r\nmen, and the recognition of new responsibilities by the State in the\r\nagony of transition. If we are busy planting small holders to-day, it is\r\npartly because sixteenth century Governments were so often busy with\r\nthem in vain. The crude barbarities of tramp ward and workhouse were\r\nfirst struck out in an age when most of those who tramped and toiled,\r\nwho sat in stocks and were whipped from town to town, were not the\r\nvictims of trade depression or casual employment, but peasants thrown on\r\nthe labour market by the agrarian revolution.\r\n\r\nFor, in truth, the change which was coming upon the world in the guise\r\nof mere technical improvements was vaster than in their highest hopes or\r\ntheir deepest despondency the men of the Tudor age could have foreseen,\r\nand its immediate effects on the technique of agriculture and the\r\nstandard of rural prosperity were but the tiny beginnings of movements\r\nwhose origins are overshadowed by their tremendous consequences. It is a\r\nshallow view which has no interest to spare for the rivulet because it\r\nis not yet a river. Though many tributaries from many sources must\r\nconverge before economic society assumes a shape that is recognisable as\r\nmodern, it is none the less true that in the sixteenth century we are\r\namong the hills from which great waters descend. By 1642 the channels\r\nwhich will carry some of them have been carved deep and sure. By that\r\ntime the expansion of the woollen industry has made it certain that\r\nEngland will be a considerable manufacturing nation, and consequently\r\nthat the ancient stable routine of subsistence farming will gradually\r\ngive place to agricultural methods which swing this way and that, now\r\ntowards pasture, now towards arable, according to the fluctuations of\r\nthe market. It is certain that, sooner or later, the new and more\r\nprofitable economy of enclosure will triumph. It is certain that the\r\nsmall holder will have a hard struggle to hold his own against the\r\ncapitalist farmer. It is certain that, owing to the substitution of\r\nvariable for fixed fines on admission to copyholds, and the conversion\r\nof many copyholds into leases for years, a great part of the fruits of\r\neconomic progress will no longer be retained, as in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, by the mass of the peasants, but will pass, in the shape of\r\nincreased payments for land, into the pockets of the great landed\r\nproprietors. It is almost certain that to any new developments which may\r\nbe detrimental to them the peasants will be able to offer a much less\r\neffective resistance than they have in the past. For the security of\r\nmany of their class has been undermined; the gulf which separates them\r\nfrom the landed gentry, though still bridged by the existence of many\r\nprosperous freeholders, has been widened; and, above all, the\r\ndestruction of the absolute monarchy has entrenched the great landlords\r\ninexpugnably at the heart of government, both central and local, and has\r\nmade their power as great as their ambitions. Both from below and from\r\nabove they are unassailable. For a century and a half after the\r\nRevolution they have what power a Government can have to make and ruin\r\nEngland as they please.\r\n\r\nIf we cast our eye over the agrarian changes of our period, with a view\r\nto grouping their main elements under a few easily distinguishable\r\ncategories, we do not find that they present themselves as a simple\r\nseries of economic sequences. Behind them all there is, it is true, the\r\nfundamental economic fact of the decay of subsistence husbandry. The\r\nmovement away from the strict communal organisation of the open field\r\nvillage was inevitable as soon as markets were sufficiently developed to\r\nmake agricultural experiments profitable, because experiments could not\r\neasily be undertaken without to some extent individualising the methods\r\nof cultivation. In particular, the grand innovation of substituting\r\npasture-farming for tillage, whether carried out on a large scale or on\r\na small, was only practicable if individuals were able to break away\r\nfrom the established course of agriculture. But the relaxation of\r\nvillage customs, which allowed a wider scope to individual initiative,\r\ndid not necessarily involve that formation of large estates out of\r\npeasant holdings, which was the special note of the sixteenth century\r\nproblem, and in fact the gradual nibbling away of customary restrictions\r\nwent on to some degree among quite small men, long before the enclosure\r\nof land by great capitalists became a serious grievance. In the\r\nfourteenth century, and even earlier, holdings are becoming partible and\r\nunequal, and strips are being interchanged for the purpose of more\r\nconvenient, because compacter, management. In the sixteenth century\r\nthere is a good deal of enclosure by the peasants themselves with a view\r\nto better arable cultivation or to the more successful keeping of stock.\r\nNor must we forget the example of Kent, Essex, Devonshire,\r\nSomersetshire, and Cornwall. Without raising the question whether the\r\npredominance of small enclosures in the Western Counties is not partly\r\nto be ascribed to peculiarities in their original settlement, we may say\r\nwithout fear of contradiction that the early enclosures of Kent and\r\nEssex are the outcome of the spread of commercial forces in those\r\nseaboard counties at an earlier date than was possible in the inland\r\ndistricts. Even in the more conservative parts of the country, like the\r\nMidlands and Wiltshire, whose geographical position made them the last\r\nto respond to the influence of trade its gradual extension was slowly,\r\nand in isolated villages, bringing the same departure from the rigid\r\narrangements of mediæval agriculture which in the East of England had\r\ndeveloped much more swiftly. How far such enclosure by consent would\r\nhave proceeded if no other forces had come into play we cannot say. It\r\nis not safe, however, to assume that, because in the eighteenth century\r\nmany villages seemed to observers like Arthur Young to be living in a\r\ncondition of organised torpor, therefore its effects in facilitating a\r\nmore economical utilisation of the land are to be dismissed as\r\nnegligible. Quite apart from the obvious bias given to Young's\r\nobservations by his questionable doctrine that a high pecuniary return\r\nfrom the soil is the final criterion of successful agriculture, it may\r\nwell be the case that the decline in the condition of the peasantry,\r\nwhich took place in the sixteenth century, discouraged initiative on the\r\npart of small men, and that, since one agent in that decline had been a\r\nmovement which went by the name of enclosure, its effect was to make\r\nthem cling all the more closely to the established routine in those\r\nparts of the country where they had not been violently shaken out of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn such conjectures, however, we need not enter. Even if the movement\r\ntowards the rearrangement of holdings which has been traced among the\r\npeasants themselves was insignificant, and if the larger capitalists\r\nwere the sole agents through whom a more alert and progressive agrarian\r\nrégime could be introduced, it is none the less the case that the\r\nimprovements in the technique of agriculture do not by themselves\r\naccount for the special social consequences which flowed from the\r\nagrarian changes of the sixteenth century. The situation then is not at\r\nall similar to that which arose at a later date, when small landholders\r\nvoluntarily threw up their holdings in order to engage in the more\r\nprofitable urban industries, and when yeomen like the Peels of their own\r\nchoice decided that the career of a cotton-spinner was more attractive\r\nthan that of a farmer. In the period which we have been discussing men\r\ndo not only leave the land; they are forced off it. Not only economic,\r\nbut legal, issues are involved, and the latter give a decisive twist to\r\nthe former. What made the new methods of agriculture not simply an\r\nimportant technical advance in the utilisation of the soil, but the\r\nbeginning of a social revolution, was the insecurity of the tenure of\r\nlarge numbers of the peasantry, in the absence of which they might\r\ngradually have adapted themselves to the altered conditions, without any\r\noverwhelming shock to rural life such as was produced by the evictions\r\nand by the loss of rights of common. The way in which the economic\r\nmovement towards enclosure and pasture-farming is crossed, and its\r\nconsequences heightened, by the law of land tenure, is proved by the\r\ncomparative immunity of the freeholders from the worst forms of agrarian\r\noppression, by the fact that, even in the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the purely economic conditions of much of England were by no\r\nmeans unfavourable to small scale farming, and by the anxiety of\r\nlandlords to induce tenants who had estates of inheritance to surrender\r\nthem for leases. We cannot therefore agree with those writers who regard\r\nthe decline in the position of the smaller landed classes, which took\r\nplace in our period, as an inevitable step in economic progress, similar\r\nto the decay of one type of industry before the competition of another.\r\nIf economic causes made a new system of farming profitable, it is none\r\nthe less true that legal causes decided by whom the profits should be\r\nenjoyed. We have already pointed out that many customary tenants\r\npractised sheep-farming upon a considerable scale, and it is not easy to\r\ndiscover any economic reason why the cheap wool required for the\r\ndevelopment of the cloth-manufacturing industry should not have been\r\nsupplied by the very peasants in whose cottages it was carded and spun\r\nand woven. The decisive factor, which ruled out this method of meeting\r\nthe new situation created by the spread of pasture-farming, was the fact\r\nthat the tenure of the vast majority of small cultivation left them free\r\nto be squeezed out by exorbitant fines, and to be evicted when the lives\r\nfor which most of them held their copies came to an end. It was their\r\nmisfortune that the protection given by the courts since the fifteenth\r\ncentury to copyholders did not extend to more than the enforcement of\r\nexisting manorial customs. When, in our own day, the same causes which\r\nraised the cry of depopulation in sixteenth century England have\r\noperated in other countries, their influence has been circumscribed by\r\ngovernmental power, which has stepped ready armed into the field, and\r\nhas turned customary titles into freeholds and cut back private\r\njurisdictions with a heavy hand. To find a parallel to the sufferings of\r\nthe English copyholders in the sixteenth century, we must turn to the\r\nsweeping invasion of tenant right which at one time made almost every\r\nIrishman into a Ket. But the comparison, incomplete in other respects,\r\nis most incomplete in this, that even if Tudor Governments, moved by\r\nconsiderations of national strength and order, would have helped the\r\npeasants if they could, they could hardly have helped them materially if\r\nthey would, without a social and administrative revolution which was\r\nunthinkable, and which, if carried out, could only have meant political\r\nabsolutism. Living, as they did, with the marks of villein tenure still\r\nupon them, the small cultivators of our period were fettered by the\r\nremnants of the legal rightlessness of the Middle Ages, without enjoying\r\nthe practical security given by mediæval custom, and felt the bitter\r\nbreath of modern commercialism, undefended by the protection of the\r\nall-inclusive modern State which alone can make it tolerable.\r\n\r\nFor, indeed, it is as a link in the development of modern economic\r\nrelationships and modern conceptions of economic expediency, that the\r\nchanges which we have been considering possess their greatest interest.\r\nThe department of economic life in which, both for good and evil, the\r\nmodern spirit comes in the sixteenth century most irresistibly to its\r\nown, is not agriculture but foreign commerce, company promoting, and the\r\nmoney market, where the relations of man to man are already conceived of\r\nas the necessary parts of a vast and complicated mechanism, whose iron\r\nlevers thrust the individual into actions for the consequences of which\r\nhe is not responsible, and under whose pressure unknown is driven by\r\nunknown to do that which he did not intend. But if the intoxication with\r\ndreams of boundless material possibilities, the divorce of economic from\r\nmoral considerations, the restless experiment and initiative and\r\ncontempt for restrictions that fetter them, which are the marks of that\r\nspirit's operations, are never quite so victorious in agriculture as\r\nthey are in finance, it is nevertheless in transforming agrarian\r\nconditions that its nature and characteristics are most impressively\r\nrevealed, not because it is felt there first or proceeds there furthest,\r\nbut because the material which it encounters is so dense, so firmly\r\norganised, so intractable, that changes, which in a more mobile\r\nenvironment pass unnoticed, are seen there in high relief against the\r\nstable society which they undermine. In truth the agrarian revolution is\r\nbut a current in the wake of mightier movements. The new world, which is\r\npainfully rising in so many English villages, is a tiny mirror of the\r\nnew world which, on a mightier stage, is ushering modern history in amid\r\nstorms and convulsions. The spirit which revolts against authority,\r\nframes a science that will subdue nature to its service, and thrusts the\r\nwalls of the universe asunder into space, is the same--we must not\r\nhesitate to say it--as that which on the lips of grasping landlords and\r\nstubborn peasants wrangles over the respective merits of \"several\" and\r\n\"common,\" weighs the profits of pasture in an economic scale against the\r\nprofits of arable, batters down immemorial customs, and, regarding\r\nneither the honour of God nor the welfare of this realm of England,\r\nbrings the livings of many into the hands of one. To the modern\r\neconomist, who uses an ancient field map to trace the bewildering\r\nconfusion of an open field village beneath the orderly lines of the\r\ndignified estate which lies upon it like a well written manuscript on\r\nthe crabbed scrawl of a palimpsest, the wastefulness of the old régime,\r\ncompared with the productiveness of the new, may well seem too obvious\r\nto leave room for any discussion of their relative advantages; and\r\nindeed the accession of material wealth which followed the first feeble\r\napproach towards the methods of modern agriculture is unquestionable.\r\nBut the difference between such a standpoint and that of our peasants is\r\nnot one of methods only but of objects, not of means but of ends. We can\r\nimagine that to an exposition of the advantages of large scale farming\r\nand enclosure, such as many stewards must have made to the juries of\r\nmany manors, they would have answered something after this\r\nfashion:--\"True, our system is wasteful, and fruitful of many small\r\ndisputes. True, a large estate can be managed more economically than a\r\nsmall one. True, pasture-farming yields higher profits than tillage.\r\nNevertheless, master steward, our wasteful husbandry feeds many\r\nhouseholds where your economical methods would feed few. In our\r\nill-arranged fields and scrubby commons most families hold a share,\r\nthough it be but a few roods. In our unenclosed village there are few\r\nrich, but there are few destitute, save when God sends a bad harvest,\r\nand we all starve together. We do not like your improvements which ruin\r\nhalf the honest men affected by them. We do not choose that the ancient\r\ncustoms of our village should be changed!\" Such differences lie too deep\r\nto be settled by argument, whether they appear in the sixteenth century\r\nor in our own day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n\r\n(I)\r\n\r\n[LETTER FROM A BAILIFF, ILLUSTRATING THE RELATIONS BETWEEN FARMER AND\r\nLORD, AND DIFFICULTIES WITH FREEHOLDERS]\r\n\r\n_Merton MSS., No. 4381_\r\n\r\nGood Sir lett me intreat you yf the colledge determyne to make survay\r\nthis springe of the lands at Kibworth and Barkby to send Mr. Kay or me\r\nword a month or 3 weeks before your coming that we may have Beare and\r\nother necessaries.

This is\r\na disadvantage. It is possible, for example, that, if the manor of\r\nRochdale could be examined in 1526 instead of in 1626, it would be found\r\nthat the proportion of copyholders to leaseholders was higher than it is\r\nat the later date. This defect, however, is perhaps not so great as to\r\noutweigh the value of the general picture of the relative proportion of\r\ndifferent classes given by the table. A great majority of the documents\r\nfrom which it is compiled belong to the sixteenth century, and are dated\r\nas follows: Those of 10 manors are of an uncertain date, those of 3 fall\r\nbetween 1450 and 1485, of 2 in the reign of Henry VII., of 19 in that of\r\nHenry VIII., of 5 in that of Edward VI., of 3 in that of Philip and\r\nMary, of 60 in that of Elizabeth, of 13 in that of James I., of 2 in\r\nthat of Charles I., of 1 in 1649.\r\n\r\n(ii) The lists of tenants given by the surveyors may sometimes not be\r\nexhaustive. I am not sure, for example, that all the freeholders on the\r\nmanor of Crondal, or all the leaseholders at Gamlingay Merton and\r\nGamlingay Avenells, are recorded.\r\n\r\n(iii) It is sometimes not clear under what category a tenant should be\r\nentered. When there is no clue at all I have entered such tenants as\r\n\"uncertain.\" In some cases, however, though there is no entry by the\r\nsurveyor, there are indications that the tenants are freeholders,\r\ncustomary tenants, or leaseholders, and, when that is so, I have grouped\r\nthem in the table according to the probabilities of the case. But I do\r\nnot doubt that I have made some mistakes.\r\n\r\n(iv) A special word must be said about Norfolk and Suffolk. In these\r\ncounties it is quite common to find the same tenant holding both by free\r\nand by customary tenure. When this is so, I have entered him both under\r\n\"freeholders\" and under \"customary tenants\" in the table. This means, of\r\ncourse, that the numbers entered for these two counties in the table\r\nexceed the number of individual landholders. As, however, my object was\r\nto ascertain the distribution of different classes of tenures, this\r\ncourse, though not satisfactory, seemed the best one to follow. In other\r\ncounties a similar difficulty hardly ever occurs, a fact which is of\r\nsome interest as showing the relatively advanced agrarian conditions of\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk. In the few cases in which it does occur I have\r\nfollowed the same plan as I have for those two counties.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II. (pp. 32 and 33)\r\n\r\nThis table is based on documents relating to the undermentioned manors.\r\nThe sources from which the information is taken are given in the\r\nexplanation of Table I., and I therefore do not repeat them.\r\n\r\n1. Norfolk.\r\n\r\nMetherwolde, Northendall, Brisingham, Massingham, Skerning Billingford.\r\n\r\n2. Suffolk.\r\n\r\nAshfield, Stratford juxta Higham, Kentford, Dunstall.\r\n\r\n3. Staffordshire.\r\n\r\nDrayton Basset, Barton, Burton Bondend.\r\n\r\n4. Lancashire.\r\n\r\nWarton, Overton, Widnes.\r\n\r\n5. Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\nPaulespurie, Brigstock, Higham Ferrers, Duston.\r\n\r\n6. Wiltshire.\r\n\r\nSouth Newton.\r\n\r\n7. Leicestershire.\r\n\r\nBarkby.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have thought it worth while to insert this table, but I am not\r\nsatisfied with it. (i) I am inclined to think that, as stated in the\r\ntext, fuller information would show that medium-sized holdings of\r\nbetween 20 and 60 acres were more common than it suggests. It is plain\r\nthat surveyors often could not locate the properties of freeholders, and\r\nthe larger the property the harder their task. (ii) Even where the\r\nholding is set out by the surveyor, one cannot always form an accurate\r\njudgment of its size. For example, rights of common, though often\r\nexpressed in acres, are often expressed in some other way, _e.g._ in the\r\nterms of the number of beasts which the tenant may graze; and, again, a\r\nman is sometimes said to hold so many acres \"cum pertinentiis.\" What I\r\nhave done is simply to enter the acreage as given in the surveys. In\r\nsome cases, therefore, the size of the holding is certainly\r\nunderestimated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III. (p. 48)\r\n\r\nThe figures in this table are an analysis of the figures given under the\r\nheading of \"Customary Tenants\" in Table I., and the source from which\r\nthey are taken will be found by looking at the explanation of that table\r\ngiven above. As I have pointed out in the text, it is probable that not\r\nall the \"Tenants at Will\" should have been entered as \"Customary\r\nTenants\" in that table. I hope that any error which may have arisen\r\nthrough their inclusion under that heading there may be neutralised by\r\nsetting them out here. It will be seen that they are not numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IV. (pp. 64 and 65)\r\n\r\nThis table is based on documents relating to the undermentioned manors.\r\nThe sources from which the information is taken are given, with a few\r\nexceptions (see below), in the explanation of Table I.\r\n\r\n1.

Nine manors elsewhere in South of England.\r\n\r\nCrondal, Sutton Warblington, Edgeware, Kingsbury, Aspley Guise,\r\nGamlingay Merton, Gamlingay Avenells, Salford, Weedon Weston (two last\r\nfrom surveys on back of All Souls Maps).\r\n\r\nIn this table are included a few landholders as to whose tenure I am not\r\ncertain. It has the defect stated in connection with Table I., that in a\r\nconsiderable number of instances the holdings of tenants are not fully\r\nexpressed in terms of acres, and that therefore it probably somewhat\r\nunderestimates their area. On the other hand, the holdings of the\r\ncustomary tenants are usually set out by the surveyors much more fully\r\nthan those of the freeholders.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE V. (p. 107)\r\n\r\n1. Northumberland and Lancashire.\r\n\r\nAcklington, Birling, High Buston, Thirston, Whytyngton.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Wiltshire and Dorsetshire.\r\n\r\nSouth Newton, Estoverton and Phipheld, Winterbourne Basset, Washerne,\r\nDonyngton, Byshopeston, Knyghton, Ewerne (the last in Dorsetshire,\r\n_Topographer and Genealogist_, vol. i. There are only three customary\r\ntenants on this manor, and only one is represented in the table, as the\r\nuse made by the others of their land is not ascertainable).\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Staffordshire, Leicestershire.\r\n\r\nSalford, Weedon Weston, Wotton in Elishall, Kibworth Harcourt.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this table the following points should be noticed:--\r\n\r\n(i) I am not certain that all the tenants represented in it are\r\ncustomary tenants. But with one or two exceptions the holdings of all\r\nare not larger than those of the customary tenants on other manors, so\r\nthat there is no reason to suppose that their agricultural economy\r\ndiffered from that usually followed by the latter.\r\n\r\n(ii) More serious, the figures are not completely accurate. I have\r\nentered under each denomination, \"arable,\" \"meadow,\" or \"pasture,\" land\r\nso entered by the surveyor. In some cases, however, the character of the\r\nland is not specified. _E.g._ it is described simply as a \"close,\" or a\r\ntenant is said to hold so many acres of arable \"with appurtenances.\"\r\nFurther, tenants frequently possess rights of pasture which are not\r\nexpressed in terms of acres, but are either measured by the number of\r\nbeasts which they may graze, or are not measured at all (_e.g._ \"catalla\r\nsine extento\"). In the latter case, which does not affect any except the\r\nWiltshire manors, I have not attempted to form any estimate, but have\r\nsimply taken their holdings as stated by the surveyor. When there is no\r\nclue to the character of the land, I have omitted it. When it is plain\r\nthat the land falls under a special denomination, though this is not\r\nspecified in the survey, I have placed it under that denomination in my\r\ntable. _E.g._ at Donyngton nearly every tenant holds \"unum clausum\r\nnoviter extractum de communia,\" and together they hold in such \"closes\"\r\n132 acres. I have entered these as \"pasture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VI. (pp. 115-117)\r\n\r\n1. Ingoldmells, Lincolnshire: Massingberd, Ingoldmells Court Rolls,\r\nPreface, p. vii. I quote the words of the editor, \"In 1086 the annual\r\nvalue of the manor of Ingoldmells was £10.... In 1295 the rents of the\r\nfree and bondage tenants were £51, 17s. 1d.... In 1347 the same rents\r\nwere £61, 9s. 4d., and in 1421 they were £71, 10s. 3d.... But in 1485\r\n£3, 7s. 4d. had to be deducted for lost rents ... from a total of £72,\r\n6s. 8d.... When the manor was sold in 1628 by Charles I., the reserved\r\nrent ... was only £73, 17s. 2d.... It is therefore clear that at\r\nIngoldmells the tenants appropriated virtually the whole of the increase\r\nin the value of the land.\"\r\n\r\n2.

At the later\r\ndate Sutton Warblington appears to have been treated as part of the\r\nmanor of Crondal, though still itself called a manor.\r\n\r\n4.

Note (a) The manor\r\nof South Newton included the parishes of Childhampton, Stoford, Little\r\nWishford, and North Ugford. I have dealt here only with the Parish of\r\nSouth Newton, (b) The figures relate only to the customary tenants, and\r\ndo not include the payments of freeholders and _convencionarii_. I have\r\nobtained the figure of £8, 3s. 11-1/2d. by adding together the tenants'\r\nmoney payments and the value of their works, which are set down in terms\r\nof money. But I am not sure that it is correct. I have omitted the\r\npayments of fowls (made at both dates) and the small payments for church\r\nshot and maltsilver.\r\n\r\n10. Cuxham, Oxfordshire: Merton MSS., Nos. 5902 and 5905.\r\n\r\n11. Ibstone, Buckinghamshire: _ibid._, Nos. 5902 and 5209.

Kibworth, Leicestershire: Merton MSS., Nos. 6375 (Rental), 6362, and\r\n6356 (ministers' accounts). The earliest entry is the payments of the\r\ncopyholders only: the two later entries are \"rents of assize.\"\r\n\r\n14. Standen, Hertfordshire: R.O. Mins. Accts., Gen. Ser., Bdle. 868, No.\r\n17; Bdle. 869, No. 8; Bdle. 869, No. 15; Bdle. 870, No. 4. The earliest\r\nentry is \"Rents assized £18, 17s. 3d. Lands let at will of lord 60s.\"\r\nThe second, third, and fourth give the total income.\r\n\r\n15. Feering, Essex: R.O. Mins. Accts., Gen. Ser., Bdle. 841, No. 5;\r\nBdle. 841, No. 23; Mins. Accts., Hen. VIII., No. 951. The first two\r\nentries are totals of quarterly rents paid at Christmas, Easter, Birth\r\nof St. John the Baptist, and Michaelmas. The last is \"assized rent.\" It\r\nis possible, therefore, that the apparent diminution is due to the\r\nearlier rentals having included payments not given in the last.\r\n\r\n16. Appledrum, Sussex: R.O. Rentals and Surveys, Rolls 643, 644, and\r\nMins. Accts., Gen. Ser., Bdle. 1019, No. 15.\r\n\r\n17. Minchinhampton: R.O. Rentals and Surveys, Gen. Ser., Rolls 237 and\r\n241. In the earlier documents the \"total rent yearly\" is given as £41,\r\n14s. 4d., and the \"sum total of works\" as £4, 15s.\r\n\r\n18. Langley Marish, Berkshire: R.O. Mins. Accts., Gen. Ser., Bdle. 761,\r\nNo. 4, and Bdle. 762, No. 5; Land Rev. Misc. Bks., vol. 188, f. 196ff.\r\nThe first entry is the sum total of rents paid quarterly, together with\r\n7s. 4d. of a custom called \"vaccage,\" and 13s. 4d. of common fine at\r\nview of frank pledge. (Exactly the same items are entered in the\r\nfollowing year.) The second entry is \"profits and issues of the manor,\"\r\nand is headed \"account of the manor for 83 days,\" but the similarity of\r\nthe figure with that of the earlier date makes it hard to believe that\r\nthe \"profits\" relate to less than one quarter of the year. The third\r\nentry is made up of rents of free and customary tenants, demesne lands\r\nheld by copy, and customary rents called \"Hedage\" and \"Duply,\" producing\r\n23s. 3-1/2d.\r\n\r\n19. Lewisham, Kent: R.O. Rentals and Surveys, Gen. Ser., Roll 361; Misc.\r\nBks., Treas. of Receipt, vol. 174, f. 1-34; Misc. Bks., Aug. Off., vol.\r\n414, f. 33-4. The first entry is \"Rent of the tenants of the manor of\r\nLewisham,\" the second \"Rental of the lordship of Lewisham.\" The third\r\n\"Rent of free tenants £17, 12s. 10-1/2d., Rent of tenants _per\r\ndimissionem_ £72, 9s. 8-1/2d., Rents of tenants at will 9d.\"\r\n\r\n20. Cuddington, Surrey: R.O. Rentals and Surveys, Rolls 669 and 624,\r\nAug. Off., Misc. Bks., vol. 414, f. 3-16. The first entry is \"Rents\r\nbelonging to the manor at the terms of Easter and Michaelmas,\" i.e. it\r\nis for half a year only, and therefore I have ventured to double it. The\r\nsecond and third entries consist of the annual rent of all classes of\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n21. Isleworth, Middlesex: R.O. Mins. Accts., Gen. Ser., Bdle. 916, Nos.\r\n11, 21, and 25. The figures at each date refer to the assized rent. At\r\nthe two earlier dates the assized rent is given for all four quarters of\r\nthe year. At the last date it is given only for the Michaelmas quarter.\r\nIn order to make comparison possible, I have given the rents for the\r\nMichaelmas quarter throughout. The full entries for the two earlier\r\ndates are: 1314-15, £15, 5s. 6d. at Christmas, £17, 1s. 9-3/4d. at\r\nEaster, £15, 5s. 6d. at June 24, £21, 16s. 10d. at Michaelmas, works\r\nsold 22s. 1-1/2d; 1386-7, £14, 13s. at Christmas, £16, 19s. 7d. at\r\nEaster, £13, 13s. at June 24, £23, 3s. 10-1/2d. at Michaelmas, works\r\nsold 106s. 10d.\r\n\r\n22. Wootton, Oxfordshire: R.O. Misc. Accts., Bdle. 962, No. 20; Bdle.\r\n963, No. 14; Aug. Off., Misc. Bks., vol. 414, f. 38b. At the two earlier\r\ndates the figures given are the assized rents of free and bond tenants\r\nand _cotarii_, at the last date they are the rents of free and customary\r\ntenants. At that time there was also a rent of 30s. 8-1/2d. from\r\nassarts, and a rent of £13, 0s. 11d. from tenants by demission. I have\r\nomitted the last two items as there is nothing comparable to them in the\r\nearlier entries.\r\n\r\n23. Speen, Berkshire: R.O. Mins. Accts., Gen. Ser., Bdle. 750, No. 22;\r\nMisc. Bks. Land Revenue, vol. 187, f. 97-101. At the earlier date the\r\nfigures refer to the assized rents, at the later date to the rents of\r\nfree tenants, customary tenants, and \"firms.\"\r\n\r\n24. Schitlington, Bedfordshire: R.O. Mins. Accts., Gen. Ser., Bdle. 741,\r\nNos. 16, 19, and 27. At the first date the figures refer to the assized\r\nrent, and include \"Tallage of the vill £10.\" At the second date they\r\ncover the same entries as at the first. At the last date they refer to\r\nthe rent as it appears in the Rental. At this time there are certain\r\nadditional entries, viz., \"Firm of land £8, 5s. 0-1/4d., Firm of the\r\nmanor £4, 15s. 4d., Increase of Rent [of a mill(?)] 13s. 4d., Increase\r\nof Rent of 1 messuage, 1 virgate with croft and meadow 13s. 7-1/2d.\"\r\nThese I have omitted.\r\n\r\n25. Cranfield, Bedfordshire: R.O. Mins. Accts., Gen. Ser., Bdle. 740,\r\nNos. 18, and 25; Mins. Accts., Hen. VIII., No. 4. At the first two dates\r\nthe figures include rents of free and native tenants and ferm of lands.\r\nAt the last date the entry is \"Rent of the vill, as by the rental, £72,\r\n2s. 1-3/4d.\"\r\n\r\n26. Holywell, Huntingdonshire: R.O. Mins. Accts., Gen. Ser., Bdle. 877,\r\nNo. 17, Bdle. 878, No. 1. At the first date the entries include rents\r\nassized, and certain miscellaneous items such as \"Hewesilver,\"\r\n\"Heringsilver,\" \"Brensilver\"; at the later date \"Rents assized of free\r\nand villein tenants £4, 19s. 8d., customary rent lately in works and in\r\nnew rent £15, 6s. for 17 virgates paying 18s. each, £6, 15s., for 25\r\ncotmen paying 9s. each, 6s. 8d. increment of rent.\"\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that it might be of interest to try to discover how far\r\nrents were stationary over long periods came to me from reading the\r\narticle by Maitland on \"The History of a Cambridgeshire Manor\" in _E. H.\r\nR._, vol. ix., where he points out that copyholders must have enjoyed a\r\nconsiderable unearned increment. The table of rents explained above is\r\nunsatisfactory, because of the difficulty of finding a basis for the\r\ncomparison of payments at different periods. Thus at the earlier dates\r\nthere are the tenants' works, and (occasionally) tallages to be\r\nconsidered; at the later the rent obtained from leasing the demense. The\r\nvariety of the sources of manorial revenue makes it impossible to\r\ndiscover a common form to which the payments on all manors can be\r\nreduced. The ideal would be to take the villeins' payments and works in\r\n(say) the fourteenth century, and to compare them with the payments of\r\nthe copyhold tenants in the sixteenth century. But since the commonest\r\nentry is simply \"rents of assize,\" which included the rents of\r\nfreeholders as well as of customary tenants, this simple procedure is\r\noften impossible.\r\n\r\nWhile the table given on pages 115-117 is certainly not what could be\r\ndesired, I am inclined to think its inaccuracies do not lie in the\r\ndirection of exaggerating the fixity of rents, but rather, if anything,\r\nin underestimating it, because (i) when a total rent is given for the\r\nfifteenth or sixteenth century, without further particulars, it probably\r\noften included the rent paid by the farmer of the demesne, which at the\r\nearlier period was non-existent, (ii) at the later period the total rent\r\noften included payments made for new encroachments in the waste. When\r\nthis is evidently the case, as at Wootton, and the amount of the new\r\npayments is stated, I have omitted them, my object being to compare,\r\nwhen possible, the rents paid by customary tenants at different periods.\r\nBut often it is not possible to make such an allowance, and therefore I\r\nam disposed to think that the figures for the later dates are more\r\nlikely to be weighted with irrelevant items than are the figures for the\r\nearlier dates. This makes the comparatively slow increase in the rents\r\nof some manors all the more worthy of notice.\r\n\r\nTABLE VIII (p. 212)\r\n\r\n1. Norfolk.\r\n\r\nMassingham Priory (two farms, Hen.
